You said the height of Liberty Statue is 300 ft. Here, it seems the waves will be 250 ft. high. In Orissa? -Yes, sir. They said. Impossible. Ive only heard. But, we can find a wave about 50 ft. high in Danushkodi. Sir, don't you think it's an "over exaggeration'? No, it's not. Such a wave swept away my father. What do you mean? l mean, it swept away my father. My father was very interested in photography. He asked me to click his snap with the swell of the wave. He said ''Itll look nice''. We got a good print of the wave. But father was gone. What do you mean by that? We didn't even get his body. It means he died, isn't it? Im sorry, Mr.Sivam.

Is it very important? He has taken away my purse. Isn't this your purse? He has taken the cash and ran away...Is it enough? Is there no policeman or a police station here? Railway station itself is submerged. -Yes, how can a police station exist?! l think, it's in that corner. -Sir, please... Don't touch my bag. Wait... He's from this town. He'll bring the bag safely. How do you know that he's not a thief? Sir, Im not a thief. Im an old friend of comrade. He's my friend, Misro. This is Aras. -Im sorry...

That bag... That bag... Wait...Let it be there itself. We'll go and take it. You go...We'll bring this bag... This bag? -We'll bring this bag.... -Don't laugh man. It didn't happen like that. Ive never seen thieves... Are we friendly with thieves and running their association? lf you had asked in the hotel, they would've told you that there's no train. At least you could've asked me... Was I so soundly asleep that you couldn't wake me up? I would've not got this bag, if he wasn't there. Its nothing. Why are you making it into a big issue? Sir, it's a big thing. Guess how much money Ive in this bag? Sir, I don't know, but I know how much money I had. Rs.4000. He has stolen it. At least he left the credit cards. Thank god!. I have Rs.32 lakhs in this bag. Its true, sir.You tell him. In Orissa, 100 Tamilians died when the dam broke. He argued in the court with the help of our Union. Only now, he got the compensation. Now, he's going to hand over the check. Its very rare to see such a person. -Tell me the details. I didn't argue, the lawyer won the case. Im just a messenger to hand over the check. But, if Mr. Misro was not there it would've taken one more year. Without knowing the Oriya language... Oh God! Look where the car is! It would've been thrown up there by the floods. Let's go. That bloody man was responsible for this...Sister . Do you know him? -No, let's go... Do you've any sisters? -No... Then, don't worry. Keep going. Don't use bad words. Why are you abusing him? What're you saying? He doesn't have any sisters. He's assuming wrongly that you do. Technically wrong. -Yeah, very funny? Technical aspects? Don't laugh! It's insulting. Yes, your city is very bad. We don't know what they're bad mouthing. From here, if we go to Andhra and go straight to Tamil Nadu. We can at least understand their bad mouthing. Its very funny.Very funny. Ive Rs.15 and you've Rs.5. How can we go with this amount? Till Orissa border... -We can go by bus. Sir, how can we go with this meagre amount? We'll get a seat for this money also. Come on. Sir, the man next to me is chewing tobacco. Ask him to either chew tobacco or play the flute. -Why? Im getting wet in the shower of his tobacco mixed spittle... Its very unhygienic.

No problem. Ive got a very good immune system. And my health is also very good. Do you have one more? Don't eat one more, if you eat you'll go crazy. Mata...? -Yes, mata (forehead). "Mata' means "Mother'. Is he scolding me? He'll feel dizzy. -He means that, you'll faint and fall down. Lie! You don't know Oriya, do you? I don't know Oriya, but I know about that drug... Drug? You mean a narcotic or something? Its a ball made out of cannabis paste. What'll happen if I eat this? After eating it, you'll walk on all fours. Yela Machi Machi Singers: Kamal Haasan & Udit Narayan. Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu Buddy, you've gone crazy and lost your sense. What happened to me, I feel butterflies fluttering in my mind. Your kick has gone up like American Dollars. Our brains have come down like Indian rupees. When we get a kick... "Knowledge gets increased'. After the kick comes down, knowledge gained will decrease. We should've some kick in life. Or else, we won't have strength. Mother's milk as well as liquor, both give us kick. You're not clever enough to differentiate between them. Mother's milk gives the kick only for few months. But, the kick of liquor will remain for our entire life. Kick may change... Will your mind change? Can a dog's tail ever be straightened? My chicken are gone... My hen...hen... What? Hen. Ive a credit card. -No, I want money. What do you want? Life is a treasure trove, the strongest will take it. Is it wrong to be selfish? Don't usurp his livelihood. lf a worker sleeps with an empty stomach, this country will ruin. You're an excellent debater. You seem to be a lawyer's relative? You're mesmerizing me with your words.

Nothing.You do one thing ..just keep eating. Ill go finish some work. I don't know why, laughter and hunger keep alternating. Your bill.. Sorry! What's this? Pay in cash. What? It seems, he won't accept credit card? Money...He wants cash payment. You should've told me earlier! Excuse me, no cash, only card. I won't accept all that. No money, you're not leaving this place. What did he say? He said he won't allow you to go without getting the cash. Whom are you shouting at? Why wont you let me leave? I don't want all that. I need my money in cash. No!

Where did you first meet your girl? In the middle of the street with my music band. Let me guess. In a temple festival? In a marriage procession? What were you doing? I was spreading a message. Oh, so you were a postman? Messenger service? You could say that too. Even Jesus Christ was a messenger. Can't you ever say something in a straight-forward way? Yep, I do. -What? Messages! Right! So... What might that great message be? Nattukkoru Seithi Solli Singers: Kamal Haasan, Chandran & Malathi. Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu A modern Jester has come to spread a message. Im here to narrate a story beautifully laced with songs and dances. Im here to narrate our pains and struggle. Listen to the story of 910. Listen to the travails of the workers. All men and women, brothers and sisters, listen to this. Let's unmask the truth. Itll lead us into trouble. We die and live everyday. Our heads roll down everyday. Gentlemen, in the beginning of this story. Our hero is a worker. A Rs.910 salaried man. When his co-workers were agitating for salary hike near factory gate. Dodging them, he slips out silently. Where is he going? Will the job come good if you question while going for it? He is going to ogle at girls. He is going in search of his lover. Adding glitter to her golden looks, she's charming him. Your eyes are filling up the void in my life. The town bus is going empty, let's go happily to a movie in that. Your take home salary is just Rs.910. How will you bear the burden of a family? It seems to be a street play. A play in the middle of the street! Getting wisdom from his love ...Our story's hero... Also jumps into the arena of struggle. There is a Law for minimum wages. There is a plan not to reduce even a penny from it. Though there're umpteen number of laws. Some still manage to pay meager salaries. They'll eat the poor alive. Who's that noble man cheating workers and paying low salaries? Look, he's over there. Let's praise the mercy of God and hail him. Long live the man in whites. Long live upcoming lndustrialist. Long live Multi Business Tycoon. Long live Business Magnet. What do you mean by business magnet? Business magnet. Rap on his head. Long live our leader. We'll sing paeans hailing your long life. Ours is a blessing heart. We'll always sing your praise. Wow! He's very good. Madam, they're criticizing your father. White dress, white beard. Stopped short of mentioning his name. Go and find out, what's it? It seems, they want a hike. Hm?. It seems, they want a hike in their salaries. I can only give Rs.910. Its impossible to raise even a penny. How are you going to manage them, boss? Ive planned a venture. Our problems will be resolved in the near future. Its a good news...At this juncture... -Ask them, will they give way or not? Joint ventures with Multi National Companies. Joint venture! They'll send raw materials from their country. We'll import. We're refining here. We're packing it here. We're planning and marketing. We'll get thrashed if we fail to market it. What're we going to import? Tea! Tea. What? Tea. Hello Commissioner uncle... -That's okay...That's okay. What's the margin of profit? Only this!? MNC people will give you crumbs. 40% to us. 60% to him. Then, what about the plight of local tea producers? Let them to go the hell! Who's bothered? For us, our foreign investors are more important. The profit we get in the process is more important. In a game of chess, as proprietors make their move. Will worker remain a mute spectator? Or keep watching the fun silently? Even if shore wants to rest, waves will never allow it. Even if trees want to take rest, wind will not allow it. Even if you run away and hide, life will not leave you alone. With a remote control from somewhere. He's playing havoc with this country. Where's the remote control? To remote control us, there're people in America, England, France and Germany. We're not alone, we're a group. Ill take them to task. Driver, let's go. Our need now is a good decision. Not just for this play. For everyone. Efforts from our side only will not bring that. Me, you, he, that man, this man. Look there, the person who's blaring horn and disturbing our play. We all must join together. ...And decide unitedly. We'll sing a new song. That'll accompany us on a long journey. Our song is not a lone voice, but a vociferous war cry of the downtrodden lot. A song that'll usher in a new era. Our difficulties are same. Come and join the voice of protest courageously. Raise like a wave in protest. Teach them weakness is not our character. Make a move, don't restrict to yourself. Its good. An arrogant heroine, revolutionary hero. Nice story. Its new! -Its not a story. Its my life. Yes, it's your life. As you think, Bala is not an arrogant girl. Excuse me! Its okay, you didn't mean it. Even I came to the same conclusion when I first saw her. Only when I met her, the second time. Do you know where I met her the second time? Myself and Mehr. Be careful, boy. You be careful lady. -Lady? If Im a boy because Im wearing a pair of trousers, You're a lady because you're wearing a skirt. Why're you fighting with the passersby on the road? That's why, I told you that Ill drive. Why don't you just admit that with your big "handle-bar" mustache... ..you feel embarrassed to be driven by a woman? Hey, did I say that? -Come on, admit it. Why're you beating around the bush? You drive. Nothing like that. Hey! Are you blind? Oh God! He has stopped the car and is coming back. Definitely, it must be an M.L.A's car. We're going to get beaten up. Im very sorry, sir. -Nalla Madan sir, you painted a cartoon on me. Autograph, please. -Im terribly sorry. You said that already. He is Mr. Madan. She is Meher. She's in our troupe. She's also an architect. Oh!...That gentleman? Hey, what man.. What's your plan for dinner? -At home. Look, we're talking amongst ourselves. Go on, then! Too much water everywhere! Tamil Nadu wouldn't quite be what it is without all these people! Okay. Let's go! Where? -To dine. My dress is soiled. -Then, Ill also stand here. Driver, splash some on me too. -No sir. Then what? Come with me. But where? -Suspense! But, the food will be delicious. Greetings sir. Are the dogs chained? -Yes, they are. Shut up, Tommy! Hello Bala, how are you? -Fine. This is my aunt. Greetings. Yes.. yes! Come. Let me introduce you to my friends. Hello. -Thank you! This is Felix. -Hello, Mr. Madan. This is Manohar. Uncle, check whether the dinner is ready or not? -Okay! Why're they here? -You wait. He's inside. You don't want them, do you? -Yeah.. Stop. Why're you here? Whom do you want to meet? Cartoonist Madan invited us here. There is no one like that. Get out! Get out! Sir, he invited us. They're my guests. Oh, your guests? Welcome, come in. ...Greetings. Come on, Nalla. Nalla, you were following me. Why were you late? You came luxuriously in a car. We came by a two wheeler. As it is, there are too many dogs in this house. Ask everyone to come for dinner. Excuse me! Come, let's have dinner, baby's waiting for us. Hello Mr. Madan. -Hello Mr. Ranjit. One minute! Excuse me, Ladies and Gentlemen! I would like you to meet my father Mr. Kandasamy Padayachi. You've come to the lion's den and how dare to twist your whiskers? Im just thinking about Mr. Padayachi dancing to our local folk beat. And that's my father, Kandasamy Padayachi. Greetings. Greetings to everyone. Who's she? She's with me. Sorry, Im... -Her name is Mehrunnisa All religions are equal in my house. What do you say? -Yes. Hail Lord Siva's mercy. Father, he's Mr. Madan. Welcome. Since morning, Bala was anxiously awaiting your arrival. Boss, the one who's wearing green shirt is Mr. Madan. Don't I know that? Hello Madan sir. Im busy with my business all the time. I can't remember faces. You've grown beard all of a sudden. That's why I couldn't. -Oh God! Since when you started sporting beard? -I was always with a beard. It looks good. Look, don't be in a hurry to catch the train. The train won't start until you board the train. I will take care of that! Relax and enjoy your feast. Okay Mr. Madan, see you. -Won't you join us in the feast? Hail Lord Siva! -Boss is on a fast today. No water too. You carry on. Dear, take care of him. -Okay... Nobody introduced me. He's my father-in-law. -Greetings. -Retired Magistrate. Did you eat? -No. Here's the dish you prepared. Bring the other dishes. Come on, bring them. Oh my God! What have you done Grandpa? -Someone please come and clean it fast. It's okay, just move over.-Sorry! Forgive me. Its alright, Grandpa. Its alright. Im so sorry! Don't worry. Accidents happen... I was talking to him. Its alright. Why do you get upset for such trivial things? Nalla, come here. Look, she has put a painting on the dining table. No, Madan sir. She doesn't agree. The painting is only visible to us. Even we can see that. Oh sorry. What do you see? This's a fish and that's a horse. What do you see? -I see many things, sir. I think, Nalla is getting into the mood. Come on, Nalla. Beautiful! What can we do with the goat? -We can only make soup out of it. Please accept this cup. Wow, that's great piece of improvisation. Can I take a photograph of that? -Why not? Okay, you want more height? You need more height. -Yes...yes. Come on, show your skills on the computer. Thank you! Wow! Beautiful! -Lights off. Its nice. Where is the bathroom? -This side. What do you want me to do? Rs. 910 is a good salary. That's why Im telling you to increase the salary by Rs. 100. They'll keep quiet for the next 2 years. If we keep on revising their pay... In the future, our grandchildren won't remain rich. They'll become workers. l mean to say that if we don't increase their salaries, they'll strike work. What can they do? We'll announce the lock out ahead of them. But, that's our arrow of supernatural strength. We've to keep it a secret. Will Govt. let us announce lock out? They'll support only workers. No Mudaliar, they'll pretend as if they're supporting them. Who's offering them foreign exchange? Its us, isn't it? Do workers give them? Can you guarantee us that Govt. will not create any problem? Why not? We can go in for a one time settlement with the politicians. But, we can't manage them with monthly doles. Government will declare this strike as illegal. l stand guarantee for that. Till Im gone, workers' salary will remain Rs. 910 only. Ill not raise even a penny. Even you people shouldn't raise it. What's the noise there? Nothing. Your daughter is hosting a party for artists downstairs. Somebody amongst them would've raised the noise. What's the noise? Since all doors are alike. So, Im stepping in and out of every room, searching bathroom. You could've asked me, couldn't you? Go straight. No please, Ive found it. Thank you! Nice books. Have you read all the books? Did you think, is it just for decoration? l may look stupid, but Im not. No, I didn't mean like that. Im terribly sorry. I want to tell you something but I don't know how to begin. Can't you help me? How can I help you without knowing what it is? Im going to say ''sorry''. But I've never had to say it before. Oh! What for? -For everything. For what happened that day on the street and what happened today here. Sorry. If I don't say sorry at least once, I can't remain in peace. But you've apologized many times now. You must do me a favor. Tell me. -Not just one, but two. First, you have to step into my studio. What's this like legendary Ahalya? Where's your studio? Here...Please come. This is my studio. Ive stepped in. Favor number two. You must paint a portrait for me. Not on the computer but on canvas. Anything which recently attracted or touched you. Even a sketch will do. Please... Im not a girl who doesn't respect artists. It's true that I am rich girl. But please don't think I am proud. Im not like my father. Im more like my mother. Comrade, sorry. I must go back home only after dropping you. Its raining...and the roads are uneven, as you know. As it is, I have a two-wheeler. Ill come now. -Ill wait downstairs. Yeah... yeah... Good night. What about the wish? Good night. Nothing wrong in this. We can send a weakling to spoil the plan of mighty. For the welfare of many workers... What's wrong in this, Comrade? My opinion says it's wrong. We're now discussing about how to manage the lock out problem. So, we'll think about a way out. Instead of doing that, it isn't our duty to play tricks like a jackal. Let's live like lions, Comrade. What's wrong in dealing with it wisely, Comrade? Im not a politician to do anything in the guise of being smart. Hello, oh God, wrong number! Hang up the phone. Its wrong number, Comrade. -Even, Im saying that. Bala is an honest girl. Ill not let you people use her as a means. Oh! Is that so? Reached that far? -Why do you also talk like that? There's no limit for Anbu(affection). No...this seems like another 2 syllable word(love). Hey...don't! We need to talk about funds for the street play festival. Let's discuss that. An idea! Shall we ask any soft drink company to sponsor us? Very nice! Then, why do you hold red flags? You could hold the white flags. Why keep talking about expenses? They're not going to ask for a 5 star hotel comforts? Why would they? If Nalla says so, they'll have a few idlis and and sleep on the Verandah. Okay, Verandah is ready. We can't even afford those idlis. Look, there may be about 200 people. If we arrange basic amenities... ...how much will it cost? -Will it cost Rs. 18,000? I asked whether it will cost Rs. 18,000? When did you come, slipping in quietly like a cat.... Beg your pardon. No, no, Im sorry. When did you come? When you certified that Bala is an honest girl. Mr.Poun said it isn't Anbu(affection) but it denotes a different meaning(Love). I walked in at that time itself... Okay, forget it. That's our personal matter. Is Rs. 18,000 enough for you? -What for? For your street play festival. Look, you asked for a cola sponsor. Bala sponsor is here. No, its Nalla sponsored. -How? This is your money. The dining table painting which you painted in my house that day. I sold it on the Internet. Greetings. Indian Food company bought that for Rs. 20,000 to use it in their promos. Really? -I know, you'll raise such questions? That's why, Ive brought all this. What's this? -Receipt. Sold for 20,000... You said that, you'll pay us Rs. 18,000. But, there's a shortfall of Rs. 2000. Oh! This is a business deal. Don't I need a commission of 10% ? Business man's daughter, right? Did I lie? Okay, forget it man... Only Rs. 2000 shortfall. But, we're getting Rs. 18,000. We'll add color to our drama function. Rs.18,000 is just an advance. You can earn more than this. lsn't it a great thing to grab money from here itself for worker's welfare? Whatever your father has grabbed from the workers.... ...is shinning bright here. Logically, I shouldn't have come here. Have you started to harp on the same string? Good morning, madam. Just nod yes to everything my father says. What's the point in enacting street dramas if all I had to say was "yes." I could've remained as his slave accepting Rs.910 salary. Oh! Is talking truth a taboo here? Don't talk till we get the money. We're getting money for a good cause. Artists shouldn't be sold, but art can be sold, okay? Visitors to my office should look at your portrait and be charmed by it. Who should get charmed? Comedy... don't add such comical streak to the portrait. Ill ensure it. Which style would you prefer? Its up to baby to decide. What do I know about art? I know only about heart. Since it's very pure, I keep my workers here. Use your own inspiration and paint it well. But one thing. The viewers shouldn't easily understand the subject of your painting. Why? They should understand only when explained. That's modern art, am I right? Sometimes I do crack jokes. Don't take it seriously. Have they come? They're waiting for about 10 minutes for you. Oh Lord Siva! Why don't we paint Siva here? Itll look beautiful, won't it? Do you mean Lord Siva? Won't it look like a temple then? When we say our profession is God. Then, office is a temple, right? Let it be. lf you tell me, when am l to start working.... l don't want it to be done during office working hours. Boss, one thing. Tomorrow's Saturday, followed by Sunday. Then, Festival Holidays... Holidays for 5-6 days. You can start tomorrow then. Don't switch on the AC during holidays as he's working here. 5 plants will be running wastefully. You'll get cool sea breeze if you open the doors. Even paint will get dried up quickly, right? Itll be correct if we start now. -Yes. Okay, Bye. Hail Lord Siva! Good. Come. Poovaasam Purappadum Penne Singers: Viay Prakash & Sadhana Sargam. Music: Vidhyasagar Lyrics: Vairamuthu Oh maiden! You spread the fragrance of flower when I draw a flower. Oh Love! Even my fingers feel the warmth of fire when I draw it. lf non-living things can come alive. What'll happen to me? You're the portrait that's killing me. When dots join, it'll become a painting. When hearts meet, it's an epic poem. Lives are also a part of the portrait. Even quarrel is also a part of love. Azure is needed to paint the sky. Which color is needed to paint our love? With my blood and with the brush like finger. Let's paint our love, come... Where do you find love in a girl's body? Its in the eyes of the person looking. Where do you find love in a girl's body? Its in the part, never touched by a man. You're an expert artist. You're an expert in flattering girls. Like the rain drops which touches the ground deceiving the clouds. You fall on me, come.. Very clever. Look, he mingled communism in the corporate office. Okay, why did you choose to do that? lf they insist on both Siva and the ball bearing. Then, we've to add dolly. Look, 910 looks very beautiful in the falls. Its seen clearly, right? Won't we know? Sickle above the head. Karl Marx on the side. 100 marks can be given for that. That painter painted as my daughter had told. l never interfered, she's very clever. Be quiet, father. -Very humble! Then, that is... Boss, he is a fraud. -What do you mean? Please come with me... Leave me... Look there, what's falling down from the falls? Water. Its flowing like 910. Yes. Salary which we pay the workers. He's ridiculing us. Look there, can you see Karl Marx? Look at the top of Siva's head. Sickle and the hammer. Okay, leave it. Look at Lord Siva. Can you recognize who that is? -Its him. l couldn't understand it myself, how could you? When I looked at that painting intently. No boss, I overheard when he was talking to his friends. It was wrong to let in that arrogant man. Yes, our workers came to know about lock out from him only. He was responsible for the strike notice. I thought, that you would know everything. Thinking that he's going to be your future son-in-law. Son-in-law? What do you mean? Don't you know about this? Okay then, forget it. How can I forget it? What're you saying? Not me but the entire office is agog. Love between them crossed the limits during the painting. You had even asked to switch off the A.C. plant. It got pretty hot. Boss, look there.... You can see it yourself... Did you see? We had asked him to paint on the wall but he has flattered your daughter. Boss, we shouldn't leave it so easily. We've to nip it at the bud. Or else, we'll lose honor in front of workers. Sir, he has come.... even Madam is with him. Come. Good night. -What? Good night. -Good night. Boss, Karuna is in the line. Hello, Madam has left. -Okay. Settle the matter silently. Please wait for a while, we'll come back now. No need, we'll go to the office on our own. AC car! They even offered soft drinks. That's why, we're in a hurry. Are we not in a hurry? We can only act on the road. Scoundrels, you've brought disgrace to the entire manhood. You people can't control your desires... What's this, Comrade? Thank God, we came by heaven. Or else, we would've got delayed. Oh God! What're you searching? Nalla has the keys with him. -Okay, you move on, Ill get the keys. Couldn't you get the keys earlier? I thought I had them with me. Hey idiots, you could've done this in the Union office? Even, if we do it in the Union office. It'll come only now. You're right, Comrade Comrade, people are coming after you carrying sickles. It was this moustached man. Hey, who're you people? Go and have tea in the Tea shop. lf you utter a word, Ill kill you. Tomorrow his corpse will be floating in the garbage. Come and pick it up. Go man. Listen! They want only me. -Go man. Go... Ill take care of it. Leave! Waste him! You're educated, aren't you? You pierced them with umbrella needle. You've fought with those college students unnecessarily... College students? They're professional rowdies. They're branding you people like that. They've filed a complaint saying 10 of you joined together and attacked them. With the music. Are you performing any musical program? Sir, we...- Be quiet. Look, l've to hear your statement also before filing the FlR. It's my fate. l'm patient... Don't irritate me. Say, whether you did it or not? We'll take care of the rest. There are eye witnesses to prove it. lf we say no...you're not going to register it. Because, higher authorities would've given you clear instructions. You carry on with your work. Union people are like this. l'm doing my duty, that's all. Ask your Union Lawyer to get you out on bail. Court will be on leave tomorrow and next day. You're going to be locked up inside unnecessarily. Okay, we'll be in the lock up, but do lock us all in one cell. Don't separate me just because l'm a woman. Madam, he's the one who is accused... others can leave. How can we leave him behind and go away? Listen...go away.... Shall l inform the Union office... - No need. Sir, l can't afford to go out on a bail. l don't know have rich friends who can get me out on bail. So, you carry on with your duty. Think again, court will be on leave for 2 days. lsn't there anybody to get you out on bail.- l'm here. Madam, who are you? l'm Bala. This is my Lawyer. l've come to move bail application on behalf of Nalla. Listen Bala, no need of all these things. How's he related to you? - We're lovers. My father's name is Kandasamy Padayachi. Our Kandasamy Padayachi!- Yes sir. Madam, please be seated. Sir, please step aside. Why?- Please, come sir. Madam, you read this fully and then sign it. Couldn't you tell me this earlier? You've trapped a rich girl. We've to settle in our life using opportunities like this. How?- ''How''? Take me for example. Even, l'm like you. You would've heard about PK of Madurai, haven't you? Don't you know P.K.? l reached this position with his influence only. Or else, l would've remained a bachelor constable all my life. l was afraid thinking that you were a true communist. You're my man. Shake hand. Enjoy. All the best. Hey Constable, make it fast. Where're you coming from? Have you bailed out that street dancer? Yes. Logically, l should've bailed you out. But you had turned the tables. What's this? - Where are you going... - Please be patient. She was brought up independently... She's of modern generation. What generation? Am l dead? My generation is still in vogue. Only my rule should prevail here. l'm going to perform her marriage within 3 months. l'll select a wealthy groom for her. She should marry him. Hello. l'm Poun, speaking. It's me...lot of problems have cropped up here. They've locked me up in a room. Why? What's the matter? l'll tell you later, l want to meet Nalla immediately. Come to the Union office. Even Comrade will be there. Both of you can meet there. No, if l come there, father might come to know about that. Or else come our theater to watch Anaconda film for relaxation. My father is an operator there. l'll ask Comrade also to come there. Both of you can talk to each other. - Okay. Where are you going? -Bathroom Come soon. Dear, where are you going? - She'll come back! now! 'Nalla Pambu!' (Cobra in Tamil) It's not Cobra, but Python. Come, call me if there's any noise from the projector. You don't touch it... lt'll burn! Comrade, would you like to have something? Coffee or Tea? Okay... Only few minutes are left. What? What's this? That day you...- Stop it... Are you returning the bail amount which l paid? Are you trying to settle the accounts? That's not my money but your own money. You painted a painting in my father's office, didn't you? That payment... l don't want any payment for that. l did that for affection! You... Are you calling me formally? Has love became affection? Damn. What? What's happening? What is this? Please, allow me to talk. - l know what you're going to say. No, what l'm... l'm rich and you're poor. You've a doubt if you can keep me happy all my life. No doubt...But, l'm damn sure! - Lie! It's a lie. Yes. Shall l tell you the true reason? Because, you're selfish. Bala, l don't know how to make you understand...- No need... l understand. Love is fun! But, when it comes to the marriage. It's a problem. You'll lose your freedom, won't you? We'll lose our freedom! Your father's influence...We can't fight him all our life. So..... So..... Marry a rich boy of your father's choice... No. No. l'll marry another person! l'll marry another person. It's enough if you attend my marriage sitting in the front row. And bless me! But that'll only be yielding and not my marriage. A corpse will get married and beget a child. Can l name my child after you? What's this Bala?... - Go to hell. Sorry. l'm going to hell. - Wait. Thanks. Comrade, what's the noise here? What happened? Why's she crying? Comrade, what did you do to make her cry? No, l'm not crying! Your leader is struggling for a girl's life. He'll write it and give! You enact that on the streets. l can't get you....tell in a simpler way for us to understand. Didn't you get her? He doesn't want to fall in love with a rich girl under these circumstances. That's right.- What's right? When he loved her, was she poor? Didn't he know that then? What can Comrade do for that? He needn't do anything. Let us all decide. What decision!- A Good decision? Good decision? - For this love story! Don't say that they're in love. Both of them.... Did you see? Why do you fight when you both love each other so deeply? Can't you go somewhere and get married? Yes. That's it! Venkatesh, when did you come? - l'll present myself at the right moment. Should we stop breathing fearing Padayachi? We all must plan something and get them married. Correct, what l am trying to say is... - Wait...l'll say... We'll take them to Kerala discretely and get them married there. There are many of our kind to support us! We'll send them to Karnataka on a honeymoon. Even we can join their marriage, right? 2 witnesses are enough! Good idea...But suggest if there's any other better idea. There is another idea. l'll tell it later. It's wrong for many of us to be in the cabin. Please go... Oh! What a fall? Painting...Street drama...ldeology... After talking all this... You were walking bravely with a moustache. The moment you saw a girl, you're running away. Aren't you ashamed? Even Karl Marx fell in love... What's there to feel ashamed of? What happened to you? Don't you really know anything or just pretending so? Take your hands off. l asked you, ain't l?- What? You're pretending, aren't you? Really, l didn't get you. Do you want me to say it in chaste Tamil? Why are you people behaving like this? Who?- Who? Got muddied, beaten up by the police. Got bitten by a dog. Will you understand only when told with a rich man's arrogance? l didn't know all this...- What? By wearing a salwar, l didn't know how to fondle you. Are you talking about Bala? - Then who else?. Shall l keep a mirror? - No...ln hotel... What did you see in her? You... She's very pretty, isn't she? Mirror itself has passed the judgment! Then, what? Why are you talking like that even you're... You're pretty, you know? Pretty? l'm like a man! Why? lf you wear a pant and shirt...- Why? Why did l wear pant and shirt? For you only. Only for you l wore this attire. Rode a bike... l never liked coffee and tea. Just because you're taking it, even l started. All my efforts have gone to the dogs. Forget it. Hey wait! What wait? You're going away by packing your baggage. Then, why to wait? From your words, l feel you love... Wow! Columbus... You've discovered it! You never told me about this! Do l've to tell you this? l was after you since 4 years. Everyone knows it. Only you didn't notice it, did you? l couldn't...according to me we both are Comrades, that's all. That's why, you were boring me with all this.- Don't talk like that. l really like you... Don't repeat ''that you like me''. Understand one thing. Like and love, both are different. Yeah! Like and love, both are different. Yeah! - Yeah! Yes, l was ignorant. But for that...committing suicide... Why do you talk like an idiot? l was about to say that l won't commit suicide. l'm a courageous girl! l'm sorry... - Go man! Sorry... - It's alright. l betrayed!- Whom did you betray? Do you mean the one who's in our troupe? What's it?- He is begging me for the past 3 yrs. to marry him. Oh! But, it was me..... For that, don't think that l won't be happy! l'll marry before you marry her. Oh!...What am l talking? Come...- No, l'll do it by myself. Shouldn't l do even this? Hereafter, Bala is everything for you. Bye. Where are you going?- l should lie on somebody's shoulder and cry. l'll go to Venkatesh! Then, one more thing.- What's it? Venkatesh shouldn't come to know all that l had told you now. Yeah! Yeah!....Yeah! Because, it'll hurt him all his life. Go man... When did you come? So sad! What happened to you? Headache? Stomach-ache? Should we get only headache and stomach-ache? Shouldn't we fall in love, Comrade? Love? Whom are you loving? My love is going away climbing down the stairs. Whom, Mehr, Are you joking? - Is this a joke? l'm sorry. Between you and her... - Only 4 yrs difference! Apart from that you're 3/4th ft. shorter than her. Love is blind, Comrade. Right. Poet Kannadasan said that our anatomies should also match to fall in love. Hey...l'm sorry. Where are you going?- lf l cry on their marriage, her life will ruin. l'll come and cry in your marriage. At least, you'll understand me. What? Can l come or not? l don't know whether to cry or laugh? Why do you get confused for this? You laugh...l'll cry. lf we keep on talking like this. We'll miss the bus. Oh God! What are you saying? Chenniappan called from Madras. It seems your daughter didn't reach there by the morning flight. You gave her a send off at the Coimbatore airport. Yes, l went up to the security check. l didn't go after that. Where did she vanish? l came to know that the Union man and your daughter... ...Are planning to get married secretly in Kerala. - Where is he now? l got the information that he went by the morning bus to Kerala. Even your daughter would be with him. Ticket....Ticket. Give me change, please. Stop... Don't run in the middle of the road. Don't worry....nothing... Go quickly. l'm here. Give me your hand. Comrade! - Wait. Comrade! Hold this. l'm not able to reach it, Comrade. Still not able to reach it. l'm just 5 feet 3 inches, Am l... Pull me out, Comrade. This bloody dog was responsible for the bus accident. Beat it...kill it. Search all over the place. Look there. That bloody dog caused the bus to overturn.. Beat it. Buddy, it has run away. A body is lying there. Oh No, he's still alive. It's impossible to save him. - Can we leave him here? Come...this side.... - Hold properly. Check if my daughter is there. Move...move...

Every day l pray for 2 hours. That's the truth. l could've reduced you to ashes.. But, l didn't do it. Why? l know Lord Siva will punish you for your sins. Boon!....It's a boon to me. You're a poor Communist party worker. Do you want a millionaire's daughter? Boss, pull out the oxygen tube. Let him die. l'll not do such things. He'll take care of it. Arrangements are being made only for that. Did they tell you, that you've only 10./. chance to survive. Boss, 20./.! Why does he need that additional 10./.? Let him give up that also.

But, l got her married with just one lie. l told her, you're dead. She believed my word. Cried for some days. Then seeing me in distress, she agreed to this marriage. lmagine yourself in my position as a father and think. You'll understand everything. l've told just one lie. Don't make me a killer. Hey! Don't think that l'm threatening you. l can give you as much money as you ask. l've never desired anyone's downfall. Everyone should live happily. Don't think l'm going away because of your threats or money power? You said something about love. l'm going away only for that love. Take it as a boon from me, which your God denied you. l'll remain a dead man for your daughter. Hey, Bloody fool, drive carefully. Live like a King. Sister! - Come here. Pour this. Why're you watching that valley? When we took you out from there. We never imagined that you'll survive and come back to us. It's all the expertise of the Doctors. Doctors? You survived because of the good deeds of your parents. It's my parent's good deeds that saved my shop from the bus. Sir, people who survive near death are said to be equal to God. Now, you're God. Yes. You too! - Me too? Anyone who shows human compassion is God according to me. It's good to hear... Come here, lazy bones. How many times have l told you to keep this inside? Allow it to get crushed under the bus wheels? Never let down an opportunity to eat. l'll make a special chicken delicacy for you. You must eat and then only leave this place. Won't you invite me also? - Get lost man. He has come alive from near death. So, l'm preparing a special dish for him. You're fit for nothing. Why do you need all this? l remembered when you said about dressing a chicken. Sacrifice that 'Satan' for him. Everything will be fine. What harm did it do to you? It overturned a bus, didn't it? That Satan. Who's that Satan? He's telling about that dog sleeping there. No way! lt'll not respond to anyone's call. lt'll come only for food. Look, how clever it is. Sister, look there. The dog has come to him and falling at his feet asking for forgiveness. Hey, do you know dog's language also? What's the dog's name? - Name is Satan. It was named like that by all here. We can't change it now. Whose dog is it? No one in particular. Public property. lt'll eat from whoever offers food and rest in any shady place. Me too! Can l take it with me? Hey, Look at this Satan's luck. Don't worry. You'll recover and be fine very soon.- Okay. She too got hurt when she was young. But, now she's fine. Okay...okay. Bye...- Bye... l'll take leave now. lf you come this side anytime, do visit us. Definitely. - Don't forget us. Coromandel may be arrived. Get ready. Here take this biscuit and mineral water. - Thank you. Didn't he say train is arriving? It seems they'll not accept, Credit card here also? But, you've bought tickets haven't you? - Only second class. It seems there's no first class in the entire train. Okay....Come...- Go. lsn't it enough to reach your destination in some class in this rain? You're incorrigible sir. This country never offers comforts even if you're ready to pay for them. That's lndia for you. Till people like you, who think they can get anything anywhere for money. That'll be lndia for you. Yeah! You'll immediately say Soviet Union is best in the world. No, we can't say like that now. - Say like that. Whether you accept or not, Soviet Union is no more a United Nation. It has broken up into small countries. Now, no Soviet Union means ....no Communism, isn't it? Then, why're you going on talking about it? Mr. Romeo. For instance, if Taj Mahal crumbles down... Will you all stop loving? Okay. Very clever....very clever. But Mr. Red, Love is a feeling. Communism too is a feeling. Many had feIt that way earlier too. But, Karl Marx wrote about it and turned it into a doctrine.- Oh rubbish! l mustn't be talking about it to you. Especially, you shouldn't talk. Why? Because...train has arrived. - Oh! Train has arrived. Why shouldn't l talk? - Can you bear the truth?- Then go ahead, hit me. Because, you're a selfish coolie. - Excuse me. You're a hawker selling products of Multinational companies on the TV. Mr. Sivam, that's my business, okay. ln the name of business, if you sell off of everything. He's already claiming rights over Turmeric, Basmati Rice. lf you bend backwards to salute him for money. Won't l doubt whether it's spinal cord or rubber cord? Listen, don't get personal. Okay. With your dirty face and handicaps. You're very proud. lsn't this personal? - That's... Yeah....Yeah...You started it. Okay, l did. Shouldn't l finish it? l'll tell you one thing. Will you hear it without getting angry?- Go ahead. Pharaohs had buiIt Pyramids, hadn't they? You are all like those slaves who carried stones then? Bones thrown by Multi National companies.... Are you saying we are dogs to pick them up? How dare you? What's this? You hit me while l was still talking... l was about to say you're slaves waiting for the bones thrown by the MNC's. It's the same thing, Mr. Sivam. What's that red thing flowing out of your nose? Blood? One minute. l'll get you some tissue. No problem, leave it. l like RED color. Red is the color, l like most. You're a mad man. You're bonker. - You too. This is what l don't want. Avoid this provocation. Will you prick on one's weak spot continuously? So, your nose is bleeding. l'm sorry, okay. Okay. Board the train. Don't feel guilty. - l'm not guilty. l'm angry.- On me? Sorry, okay. No, l'm angry on myself. l'm angry for getting angry. Don't get angry often. It's a disease. Watch out, your eyes have turned into Communist color. l'll take care of them. Leave it. There's a way to stay cool. Do you know that? You mustn't insuIt me again.- No, it's a good one, will you follow it?- What? Do you believe in God? lf you do, think of God in your mind. Then? - Closing your eyes, Count from 5 to 1 . Count down. lf l count down like that. Okay. You do it...train will go away. Try it once. Jesus! Where're you? You piece of shit. Come out....You... Open the door. This is red, the color you like most. Is it enough? lsn't this anger? How coolly and in a matured way l showed my anger? You punched my nose and l punched your nose. Accounts closed. Okay. We both had bleeding noses. That's all. Okay, open the door. Okay. Where's the mineral water bottle? - Won't you wash with this water? To drink. l bought a bottle for you. Did you leave it behind? Go and get it. Otherwise train will move. Please sir, it's paining. Me? lf you don't mind. Come on, Mr. Sivam, hurry up.- Coming. Hurry up...Hurry up... Open the door. Open the door. l'm doing that only. - l'm handicapped. It's stuck. Oh! Door is jammed. Open it quickly. Okay! Try to open it without getting tensed and angry. Oh! Shouldn't l get angry? What should l do to control my anger? Thinking about my favorite God in my mind. Closing my eyes. Should l count down from 5 to 1? But, train is moving forward. Bye Mr. Sivam. Sorry....sorry... - It's alright. l'm sorry...- it's alright. Are you going to Chennai? Listen, l'm sorry. l don't lend my books. l don't lend my books to others. Oh! - Didn't get it? l'll explain it in Tamil. lf you give your book and your girl friend... They'll open the cover and ruin it. That's the meaning. l told that in God's own language. You've forgotten God as well as Sanskrit language. You know Sanskrit. - l don't know. l shouldn't lie with a name of Uttaman(Good man in Tamil) l know many things. Take it as, l don't like advertisement. Advertisement reminds me. Do you know Ogilvy? Father of the World of Advertisement. - He's a great man... That's... He had proved that Man is what he's wearing. l like this man. Are you an Ad film maker? - Of course. l'm also an Ad film maker. Of course, l don't know much about that. Then, Mahatma Gandhi is also my Guru. lf you ask me, how's that? You can take the same connotation. Connotation. Half Naked. He had proved dress isn't important, but the man is. Yes. What happened? Am l talking too much today? No, l like it, Mr. Uttaman. It's such a great pleasure to meet you. - Why? l got stuck with a man from Bhubaneswar to lchchapuram. Is it? l almost cracked while trying to take him off my back. You're what your company is.- Yeah! Would you like some biscuits? - No....No... l'm sorry. l can't take this. - Why? l mean...l've heard about 'Biscuit Gangs' looting passengers. l don't want to take any risk. - What? Of course, l'm not blaming you.. - Did you buy them yourself? That's....- So, you didn't buy them yourself.- No. What's this? - l've saved your life. You want a diversion now, that's all, isn't it? Whisky! It's not risky. Hold this. Have a shot, man. Excuse me....Sir....sir. Yeah....yeah... Sir....Bag...- What? My bag, suitcase, laptop everything is missing. Oh God! l don't know Telugu. No problem, you can speak in Tamil. All your baggage is missing. - Yes, sir. He has taken away baggage of 2 others along with yours. Oh God! Who's that man, sir? The man who was sitting here and talking to you last night. Who? Mr. Uttaman. - Yes. How can you be so sure? He's the lone man missing, so surely he'll be the thief. No Sir....no chance. No, sir. He's a very decent man. No sir...no chance. He was very fluent in English and Sanskrit. He was wearing suit and tie. He would've stolen it from people like you. No, l don't believe this sir. Will a man wearing suit and tie be a gentleman by default? Will a man wearing Home Spun cotton, be a freedom fighter? What's this, train has also come to a halt?- Yes. When will we reach Madras if we travel like this? lt'll take 2 days. What? The train which went before this has met with an accident near Bapatla. Many people are fighting for their lives.

Ever since then, on seeing blood... Oh! Shit! You're alright? - No, l'm not alright. Since then, l've great aversion for hospitaIs and ambulances. That's alright. How did you reach this place? lf l tell, you'll say you feel like vomiting and giddy. l came in an ambulance carrying blood. l've many doctors and nurses as friends. Look, you've friends all over the world. l'm confused as to whom l should believe? The man l met... Now, man has become a cannibal. l'm also hungry. l threw away the biscuits you bought for me, on that cheat's advise. But, one thing Mr. Sivam. Appearances are deceptive. This is what l had told you at Airport. There's no need for a terrorist to appear ugly. He can look handsome.... - Like me. Likewise, there is no need for a good man to look handsome. He might look... With an ugly face, something like you. How's that you're able to laugh for everything?- l feel like that. But, l don't feel like that. You'll also be able to.

Getting a boy wounded in it. Taking him to the brink of death. Then, suddenly helping him to get a rare blood group. Saving his life. What's all this tyranny to kill him on the way? What sort of a God are you? ln fact, in such situations only belief in the existence of God gets shaken. No. l'm sorry. Unlike you, l believe in God. Who said, l don't believe in God. Oh! Have you suddenly become a theist? l'm a theist since a long time. Who's that God? Look, l don't understand your jokes, man - Because, it's not a joke. The heart that sheds tears for a stranger. That is God. Thank you. Why're you so merciful on me suddenly? Because, l'm also a God. l know it. There must be some hook. Okay. Who said you're a God? A woman petty shop keeper on a mountain said so. l started believing it from that day. Didn't get it, isn't it? You mustn't understand. That's God. A. Aras, you're a good man. So are you? - l know. You're a last word freak. Who's God? You and me are Gods. Life is a penance. Love is God. lf heart is just a piece of flesh. Fire will consume it. lf it's a tool of Love, it'll win over death.

Get it signed and deposit it in the bank. lmmediately.- Sir, Excuse me. Mr. Sivam told, he resides at house no:16. lf he comes here, he'll stay here only. lf he comes? Then, what about his wife and son? His wife and son? He doesn't have anyone. No....No...He said he has a son. He has a son. He said his name is Sankaran...Sangu. Did he say Sangu is his son? - Yes. ln a way, he's right. He's here. He's Sangu. Sangu, got bored with the ball, have you come here hopping? Come. l was calling you only on the phone. That cheque was in your bag. l gave the cheque. Did you go to the Union Office? Yes, l went there thinking it was your residence. Is he your son? Wife? That's not a total lie. May be l had someone like him in my heart. Leave it. Is she dead? Still not yet born. Nice. The truth is, l don't have any near relation. Everyone has a complex. l've a complex that l don't have a wife. Am l not wearing a platform shoe to adjust my leg which is short? My wife is.... lmaginary walking stick. l shouldn't get dejected in life, should l? Okay, get into the car. Why? Because, l'm getting married today. l know that, l'll come later in the evening. No! Now... Why're you threatening me now? Why should l come now? Because, l'm a God! l'm ordering you. Get into the car. l'm also a God. l'm also saying l'll come later. Sangu, get down...down...- No, stay. Can't you understand the feeling which the dog had understood? Dog, written backwards becomes GOD. Why do you always torture me by your arguments? l too don't have anyone. No sisters, brothers. l had a brother. ln my young age itself, l lost him. He died getting hit by a cricket ball. l've told... l already told you all this man. - Yeah. Sorry. l've got back my brother again... Yeah! okay. - Yeah! You must always be with me. ...All my life. Why didn't you tell me all this earlier? Why didn't l? l was little shy. Now, l'm not. Is it love to go on repeating? You should understand, man. Now, you're getting into the car. You're a mad man. What's this? What's all this adventure? You gave us anxious moments with floods backdrop. l've come back, haven't l? It's all over. He's the man responsible for my coming here safely.- Thank you. lf he hadn't been there, everything would've been delayed. We would've been in trouble had we not found a marriage hall.- Thanks brother. Not younger, elder brother. Not you...me. Elder brother? Didn't get it? - Didn't get it? l'm a God. You understood this at least? No, l didn't get this also. - You won't get this also. You are all Gods. l'll explain to you later. Can l have some coffee, please? Uncle, what are those marks on your face? Child, you mustn't ask that. No problem. - She can ask. He has an answer for every question. l went to a barber's shop for a shave in Gujarat. An earthquake hit at that time. What happened after that, uncle? - Hi Saras, how're you? l've come back, haven't l? My phone is not working. l'm calling from my uncle's cell phone. Yes. Okay, when shall we meet? Oh my God! Okay...okay. Madam is very angry. - Won't she be? Would you do me a small favor? - What favor? Give this letter.... - Love letter? - Yes. l wrote it in Bhubaneswar. - Come... Through this, you're cajoling her by narrating a dramatic story.- Okay. Not only that, you're changing your dress also. - This is good, isn't it? This God didn't like it, okay? Not only that, you're groom's friend. So, hurry up. Bride's people are staying that side. Okay. You carry on. Bloody rogue! Why've you come here? Don't allow anyone in. Keep a vigil. - Okay, boss. Is this your daughter's second marriage? - Hey, don't talk. Before anyone sees you, go away from this side. Go away. It's wrong to misbehave like this with groom's people. Do you know the consequences if Anbarasu comes to know about this? How do you know the groom? Calling me disrespectfully. How do you know the groom, sir? He's like my younger brother. Okay, forget it. Tell me, what do you expect from me? It's getting late. Where's the boss? - He's discussing inside. He has ordered not to allow anyone inside. Go....move away. l fall at your feet. - Oh No! Oh God! Why're you falling at his feet? - Close the door, man. Go. Is it enough? l never asked for this. Okay. Order me. l'm ready to do anything. l want to meet Bala. - No...no way. You can't meet Bala. Why not? l can walk up to her. Am l a 10./. living dead man? Unnecessarily, don't interfere. Tell me. - You do one thing. Sit in a corner and meditate. Let me see, if your Lord Siva will dare to stop me. l feel it's my chance now to grant you a boon. You love Bala, don't you? Forgive me for her sake and grant me a boon. How can l grant a boon? You lied to me that Bala is married and pregnant. You lied to Bala that l'm dead. You had cheated your daughter Bala. - God promise... Why do you unnecessarily drag God into it? Did you ever wait in a queue to pray God? You'll always jump queues. You'll commit all sins and donate liberally. God will forgive all your sins and save you, won't he? A God saving you like that is not at all a God. He's just a coolie. Because, he's also taking money to do a job. l've understood. - What? Cash....Hot cash... You want only that, right? You quote it, l'll settle it here itself. l don't want it in one go. Send it to me every month. - Why? Forgot? 910! That's workers' problem. What's your need? Tell me, what do you expect from me? Let their problems get solved. That's what l want. You sign the agreement enhancing their salaries. l'll go away. It's time for marriage. Is it possible to arrange for a meeting now? lt'll work out. You talk to them on phone, they'll come. We are here for that purpose only, aren't we? Hi. - Hi. Thank you.- You look very beautiful in this dress. How's this T-Shirt? Mr. Sivam wears only full sleeves he doesn't wear half sleeves. Mr. Sivam? Yes...my new elder brother. Elder brother?- l'll tell you about it later. l just want you to look for. How's this? How's this? Hereafter you're a big hero among workers. Long live. Enter politics! You'll be very successful. l don't have such an ambition. l'm just a tool, that's all. After hitting a nail, a hammer should be put to rest. After cutting the crops, a sickle also needs to be put to rest. l'll watch you sign the papers from a corner and walk out silently. Let it appear as if you came down yourself. Give this letter to Anbarasu. - Why? Don't get scared. You can read and then give it to him. Boss, Union leaders have arrived. You read it and then hand it over to him. Greetings sir. - Greetings. Is it ready? - It's in my hand. Where's he? It's in the bag. - Take it out and keep it ready. Don't run on to the streets. You might get hit by a bus. Be careful. Thank you very much sir. All workers will hail you wholeheartedly. No need of all those big words. Hail mercy of Lord Siva... Siva orders me, l just follow it. That's all. Then, we'll take leave. - Okay. - Then, we'll take leave. We can paste this agreement on the board. And give it to newspapers, isn't it? One minute. How can you leave without partaking the marriage feast! Is everything ready? - Everything is ready. Have food and go. We can send in a press note today itself. - You did a good job. Boss...boss... What's this, boss? Go and get my rifle. He made me kneel down before the workers. l mustn't leave him alive. - No boss, don't harm him. Your daughter's marriage is in progress, you don't do anything. Why am l here? Order me, l'll do it. Okay, don't do anything here. Make it a clean effort. - Okay. His death should look ugly. Whose letter is this? Didn't l tell you about my brother Sivam? What language is this? l'm not able to understand a word of it. It's Tamil. Scribbled. His right hand is paralyzed. He wrote with his left hand. You're able to decipher it? Why don't you read it for me? My dear Comrade God, Anbarasu. Though our principles are totally different. For giving me a relationship and a permanent place to stay... Give it to me. Birds and Mendicants don't have a permanent sanctuary. l'm also a bird. A bird that finds permanent sanctuary uncomfortable. Even so, the affection you've for me shouldn't go waste. Share it fully with your wife. I doubt I'll ever come again under the shadow of my brother's love in my life. But, there're many surprises stored for the next minute. Meeting you is also one such surprise. I'm embarking on a journey with a hope on this surprise springing world. There're many pleasant surprises in store for your future wife. You'll be the reason for all that. You must be. Your loving brother, N. Sivam. Where're you going? Come here. Come here. Entered the dust bin. You ass. Sorry, you dog. Listen to me. Spit it out. I'll buy you good food. Listen to me. Good food. Is it a cat? Don't harm the dog. Sangu, go away. If I had been like before, I would've fought with you. Now, I'm an invalid. I read your letter. I committed many sins at the behest of Kandaswamy. For that God has punished me. Do you remember, we had come to meet you in Hospital? After that within 6 months my daughter fell sick and died in a hospital. My only daughter. She should've been married by now. You saw my boss, didn't you? But, God never punished my boss. Like a hunter's dog. God has punished me for the sins I committed at my boss's behest. If I commit sins further harming good people like you... God will punish me with a gory death. I believe in God. I don't know about you. I too believe. -Is it? Which God? Me? A man who comes to kill another man, changes his heart and asks forgiveness. According to me, he's a God. I've changed my heart. I'm not any God. Don't talk like an atheist. There're many Gods roaming around. We are not able to identify them. Believe me. Thanks. I'll take leave. -Don't come. Don't come and spoil my life. I'll tell my boss I've killed you. What do you say? I won't not spoil your life. Live happily. Let's all together say it in one voice. ...Love is God. I can't believe he did this to me. But he's right. Sivam is like a bird. It was my mistake to think of caging him up. Son-in-law, you can talk leisurely. It's getting late, please come. Boss! I've finished him. Hail Lord Siva's mercy. Who's God? You and me are Gods. A man drinking nectar of Love, lives eternally. Life's span is as long as your heart's magnanimity. Love is God.
