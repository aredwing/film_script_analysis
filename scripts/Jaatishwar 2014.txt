Don't tell me you're having second thoughts again. Somewhat. - - I think I'll go mad now. Graduation in Bengali, M.A. In History, now what? Mountaineering? It's only because of you that I'm here instead of my Dad's business. Stop flirting, Amit. Listen Maya, if you want to do Music... ...I think you might as... - - Miss Firebrand, Mr. Coward Lee... Not again! Let's go to the canteen. M. Phil in Portuguese studies. Gujarati by birth. Aspiring Bengali. Name: Withheld for the time being. Why don't you complain? - - Why? What's bugging you? Moreover I think he is quite cute. Stop joking. Shut up. - - Brother, three. If someone stalks me, wont I get irritated? And I know these guys very well. Mouli has told me... ...typical Gujarati guy with a rich dad. Weird! Follows me everywhere I go. Keeps sending messages through people! Is this a college? Oh I see! You mean you would've dated him in college? This is university, so... - - Not at all. Not even during my pension years. Yes, true. The bugger's totally crazy. He was supposed to pass out four years ago but... ...then he saw her and fell in love. Then he started with some Portuguese or Spanish studies... Excuse me. Yes. I want to... err... ...I needed to speak to you. Only you. Only you shall I tell. Shut up. Tell me. Err... Not here, if you could come out... English would be better. I don't prefer Hindi and you can't speak Bengali. Sit, I'll be back. Yellow pants. Correct decision. I really don't have time. And I hate walking. The thing is... sorry... ...what I wanted to say is... I mean to say... ...the things is that... - - The thing is that you're wasting your time. Because you're interested in someone about whom you know nothing. You don't know her, don't know her likes and dislikes, ...you can't even pronounce her name properly. Just a second, Madam. You're not letting me speak. I am a complete Bengali. I was born in Kolkata. My father's a chartered accountant. You're Bengali is flawed and desperate. This existential crisis is very insulting for my mother tongue. And the city is called Kolkata, not 'Kolkata'. Thirdly, I really don't care if your dad's a... ...chartered accountant or a businessman. We don't have any similarities. Love is a far cry. Friendship too won't work. You have Dhoklas for breakfast and our plates are aquariums, so... I like fish too. In fact Hilsa is my... - - Eating Hilsa fish makes you a Bengali? I read Bengali poetry and stories too. I read Tagore. Satyajit Ray? - - Think you can land... ...a Bengali girl reading Tagore's translated work, Mr. Lee? I suggest you get lost. In translation. - - Mr. Lee? But I'm Rohit. Good. Stay whatever you are and let me remain the way I am. I know Bengali songs too. Maybe it's only for you That I am wildly in love I know you're unique- - Wow! You have a very nice voice! Okay, here's the deal. First compose a Bengali song about me... ...and then sing it with proper Bengali pronunciation. And then, I'll think about your proposition. Okay?

Welcome to the final semester... ...of our international exchange program. I'm Professor Salazar, your chief counsellor for this session. A session on the historical segments of Portuguese studies. During the semester we'll have a total of sixteen credits. And you shall be graded on a final dissertation. For your topic you'll have a choice of the following: Colonial Politics. Fine Arts. Music. Or Architecture. And for each of the broad subjects, there's going to be an expert supervisor... ...who will help you with your chosen subject, in terms of the bibliography, videographic and audiographic material... ...and the presentation techniques. I want to thank you all for your attention and your time... and I want to wish you the very best for this semester... ...and for the rest of your career. Thank you very much. Med school student. Has a petite girlfriend. Only Bengali guy in the campus. Name: Bodhisatya. Hello Mr. Disco Dandia. Again that grumpy face. What's wrong with you? How many times do I have to tell you? Only speak in Bengali with me. I need practice. - - Mission Maya? How long shall this madness continue? See I understand people fall in love. Things don't work out. They move on. No one laments like you for three years. I'm lamenting? - - Aren't you? When you don't have studies, you either sit here... ...or in the music class, lost in your thoughts for hours. Just being optimistic. Somewhere, someday... ...a miracle may happen. - - Now this is too much! Sitting here like a 'Lathkhor' (loser)... - - What? What's this 'Lathkhor'? Lathkhor. Lath? Kick? You know, a kick? A kick? And 'khor' means the one who... Will you stop this? - - Okay. Okay let's assume I suddenly bump into her somewhere one day. If I don't know Bengali... ...sorry for the pronunciation. How am I supposed to speak to her then? And about what? If I don't learn music, don't know Bengali culture, - - Listen bro, it doesn't work like that. And you seriously think this is an issue nowadays? Bengali-Gujarati, Bengali-Punjabi, Bengali-Marwari... ...it's happening all the time now. I have a distant cousin who married a man from Greenland. Eskimo blood running in his veins. Fine. Don't look that far. Look at me and Gabriela. Listen, Maya is not interested in you as a person. She just used that 'culture' crap to avoid you. You don't know her, Bodhi. She's Bengali with a vengeance. Immersed in Bengali culture. All the time she is with... ...Bengali songs... ...Bengali poetry... ...Bengali dance. She feels, Bengali is intellectually... ...the most superior race. Sorry for my flawed Bengali. In fact, can you imagine... ...if not necessary... ...she does not use one English word... ...in a Bengali sentence. Hello friends, we're back from a break. I'm Maya. You're listening to 'World of Music' on 98.3 Radio Mirchi. You just heard 'Bhindeshi Tara' by Chandrabindoo... ...and Sudhin Dasgupta's 'Kathay Kathay'... ...in Manna Dey's voice. Our last song today, Salil Choudhury's composition, ...lyrics by Sukanto, sung by Hemant Kumar... - - Boss is calling you. ...'Abak Prithibi'. Enjoy! Please, concentrate on your studies instead of thinking of Maya. Don't forget this is your dissertation year. Thought of a topic? No. Think I'll go to the library after the music class tomorrow. Let's see... ...I'll figure out something. It has to do with music. And knowing you, Bengali music. Adios Amigo. Born in the suburbs, now resides in upmarket Kolkata. Bengali roots; forgotten. Speaks English with pride. Bikram Botobyal aka Vicky. The reports are out, not happening man. Just not happening. What is not happening and from which angle do I appear to be a man? Cut it out, Maya. You're articulate, you've a nice texture, so I offered you Coffee house Classics at prime time, you refused. You said you want to play Bengali songs. I said, fine. I said change your name, you threw tantrums there too. Of course! What was the problem with the name, 'Mahamaya'? As in? RJ Mahamaya? Are you kidding me? It sounds so... so... - - Bengali, and you have a problem with that? Maya, now don't start all over again with your Language Movement. The ratings are dropping man. See, I am cool with remixed Rabindrasangeet and Bangla Band. We can have a separate slot for that because they sell. But these drab songs that you play from 50s... - - Not selling, isn't it? You're mixing up the TG. Ratings are dropping. Listen Mr. Vicky aka Bikram, my target group is... ...the population that likes listening to all kinds of Bengali songs. They may be few in number but they're increasing and realizing... ...that there is Bengali music beyond Rabindrasangeet and bands. Yes but... - - No, there can be no 'but', Sir. Along with Rabindrasangeet and band music I play... ...Sudhin Dasgupta and Salil Choudhury too. In order to love Bengali music one must listen to... ...Mohiner Ghoraguli and Ramprasad likewise. Because both Nachiketa Chakrabarty and Nachiekta Ghosh have written about me. Because both Anjan Dutta and Mukul Dutta... ...have written their songs in my language. Because Apupam Roy, Anupam Ghatak, Rupam Islam, Nazrul Islam, all are mine. Bye. How have you been! How have you been? You've shaved! And how're you? Had to do away with the intellectual stubble for my job. Okay... this one's yours. Give me. And... ...wait a second... ...this too is yours. - - Oh my God! This is yours. - - Thank you! And check this out. - - Saradindu? For her? Inform your dentist before you read that Bengali. So tell me, how do you find your city after so many years? Let's see... the roads are less dug up. The water's turned mineral, the air's less polluted... ...and among fruits, mangoes have become costlier. And what else? What did you do in the last two years? I found a job after the university... What about you? - - Well... umm... ...my story too has been quite... you know... Great. Writing the screenplays of your lives together, are you? Tell her! - - See, the situation is a bit like... ...we're seeing each other. 'A bit' as in? In grams or metric tonne? Though I haven't been informed, so... - Maya... - - Maya. She is not pissed off. That's brilliant! Congratulations! Something worthwhile finally, both of you. And as they say, you may now kiss the bride. Okay! Stop it. What? - - Anyway, what about you? What about me? Life goes on. Radio station. Chatting people up, playing their requests, that's it. Still single? Sadly. Because you changed. - - Cut the crap. What about that cute guy, is he still pursuing you? Right, what was his name? That guy... Mr. Coward Lee. Did he finally gather the courage? No. He had managed to get my email id and sent me a mail. Doing something somewhere. - - What did he write? Is the knight with a shining guitar... ...returning with Bengali alphabets? Sir, I need to go back to India. - - An unscheduled vacation? Err... no Sir, a research assignment. Hello. - - Hello. Namaskar, Sir. Please come. Please take your seat. He looks exactly like Heynsman Sahib. Isn't it? Gourhari? - - Yes, you're right. So what's your name, sahib? - - Antony. Heynsman Antony. He was born in a very wealthy Portuguese family, Sir. He came down to India in the early nineteenth century. Landed at Chandannagore, West Bengal. Earlier it was known as Phawrashdanga. Though he was a businessman's son, his main interest was music. And he then went on to become one of the main proponents... ...of the 'Kabigaan' tradition of Bengal. Kabigaan? - - Yes... sort of... ...sort of troubadours or minstrels, Sir. They would get into musical battles through songs... ...and the songs were mainly about the Hindu gods and goddesses. Hold on, let me get this straight. This is your dissertation topic? Yes, Sir. I feel that's a very interesting topic but... ...couldn't you find something else that has a little more... ...information available? Which is exactly why I need to go, Sir. There is very little information on the internet, apart from a mention of a fictionalized Bengali film. Actually, Sir, I feel very strongly about this. I'm a Bengali, you know. And a musician too. I find it very inspiring that one can actually learn a language, overcome all odds and then go onto write a song. Okay, let's see. A Portuguese musician makes it big in colonised Bengal. Go for it, son. I'll speak to Maurinho on your behalf. How about some music today, Sahib? Want to listen? What do I sing? A song, of course. Not tax accounts obviously. Heard you're into music? Are you carrying an instrument in that bag? Want to see? Wow! Going only for the dissertation, right? Took music lessons all these days, learnt Bengali from you, won't I accept the challenge? Brilliant! That was ecstatic! Brilliant! Enchanting! Sahib, care for a drag? Mini... Mini... Mini... Mini... Mini! Mini... Mini... The cool widow. For everything from a power cut to... ...terrorism, recommends a cup of tea as a solution. Name: Ma. What a surprise! You two have remained the same, not changed a bit! Really! - - So your diet's not working. Come in. - - Tofu has become her stable food! Auntie, long time since we had your special egg curry. Why not today? - - I got diagnozed with Uric Acid. Oh no. You're laughing? - - And what's with you? Your boss has driven me crazy with his phone calls. Why do you leave your phone behind? I think I'm fired. - - Huh? What! Anyway, tea? - - Yes. Ma! I just lost my job and your offering them tea? Look at her! We'll miss the tea because you got fired? You called? - - Thirteen times. What is the use of carrying a mobile phone if you can't... ...carry it along wherever you... - - Am I fired? What! Why? After that day's speech and today's missed calls, that's natural. Rubbish, Maya. Listen. I've had a phone call from a very important person. Someone in the ministry. They want to... ...they want us to organize a concert. So, it's kind of huge, can you come down? Right now? Impossible! Tomorrow, at the station? Okay. Tomorrow morning, at six. - - What! Hello. Hello. Hello. This is Rohit Mehta. And this is the first documentation under coursework numbered... ...536, under the title... ...'The Life and Times of Henysman Antony'. We're at Chandannagore now... ...looking for our first lead. Heynsman Antony, who was known as Antony Phiringi here. Before we gather any written information... ...let's see, what is the general awareness and perception... ...about Antony amongst the normal public. Has anyone heard of him? Do people know him? Etc. Let's start with the market. Antony, the foreigner? - - I don't quite... - Must be a Frenchman. Marcus Anthony? My name is Anthony Gonsalves. I want to spend my whole life Antony? - - Yes. What? A school? I am the night and you're my moon- - Uttam Kumar played the role in Bengali... ...and Amitabh Bachhan in Hindi. No. - - You mean Uttam Kumar? Shakespeare. "Friends, Romans, countrymen; lend me your ears, I have come to bury Caeser. Not to praise him." ATV star? - - No idea. The Zamindar families here? Ask there. You'll find him. A Bengali film. We're ordinary people. All we're concerned about is our daily bread. Open the gill. - - What's the address they've given? Chandannagore is a huge area. - - I've acted in plays in college. Kundu Villa is nearby, go there. - - Antony and Cleopatra. I played Cleopatra. I get all that but who is Antony? Excuse me. - - Yes. Which way is the Central Library? Go straight, take a right and then left. Yes? Needed some books on 19th century Bengali culture. Name of the book? Who is the author? I have it on my mobile. Just a second. Yes, Ishwarchandra Gupta's... 'A Poet's Biography', Prafulla Chandra Pal's... 'Ancient Poet's Song', Niranjan Chakrabarty's '19th Century Scriptures... ...and Bengali Literature'. And Madan Bandopadhyay's... 'Singer-song-writer, Antony, the Foreigner'. Kushal, see what he wants. Assistant librarian by profession. Voracious appetite for books. Name: Kushal Hajra. Hello. These books... ...Ishwarchandra Gupta's... - - Not available. Huh? The four books you want, we don't have them. We've the fourth edition of Asith Bandopadhyay's... 'History of Bengali Literature'. I can give it to you. But if you want to know about Antony the singer-song writer, you won't get more than two pages in it. Umm... I mean... err... ...can you tell me where can I find these books? Not in Chandannagore. Try College Street in Kolkata. But people usually don't keep these books anymore. You could take a chance at the Bengali Literature Association. Okay. Thank you. But you won't find. But... ...you just said... - - You'll find the books. Not Antony. And definitely not his times. So where can I find Antony and his times? Do you have the time for that? And the patience? Try me. Fine. Wait behind the Sacred Heart Church at 8pm tonight. I will... ...take you to Antony. The government is about to get into a pact with Bangladesh. Before that they want to organize some sort of a... ...a Fraternity concert and all that, you know. As in involving student communities of both the Bengals. Some kind of a, you know... rock fest... ...or a rock band competition or something like that, so... ...they want us to be the radio partners... ...and organize this side of the entire thing. So we'll have to decide what... - - Yes, but why Bangla bands only? Is Bangla band the only way to unite the Bengals? Rabindrasangeet, Atul Prasad, Nazrulgeeti... - - Maya! Hold on. Hold on for a second. Hold on to your crusade. This is not your radio show, okay? This is a format decided by authorities. So they must have thought that it... ...has a youth connect or something like that. Whatever, ...that is not the point. Point is this coming... ...21st February, on World Mother Tongue day, will you... - - At least call this day by it's Bengali name? Okay! Whatever! Will you help me put up the show? Is the question mark just a formality or do I have the option to refuse? Christ! Maya, Bengali songs are your strength! So this huge process, you know... ...the screenings, the student auditions... ...program scheduling, deciding on the judges... Maya! You know all the music personalities in town! It can't happen without you, Maya, I mean it'll be a mess. It'll be a pandemonium! - - No, a bandemonium. Huh? I'll be there. And the concert will be called Bandemonium, 2014. Hello. Now we're going for the second documentation of the coursework. An interview... with the very mysterious Mr. Kushal Hajra, ...who is about to introduce us to Mr. Antony. Henysman Antony, a guy who according to the history books, ...is dead for one seventy-seven years. Needless to say I feel Mr. Kushal is a fraud. In fact, worse still, he may have other intentions. But there was something about his voice, so I came. And who knows, I might find a crucial lead about Antony. Let's see. So... ...you had told me that... ...I'll get to meet Antony? - - All in good time. Sit. And tell me what you know about Antony? Not much. In the late 18th century, he was born in... - - What a shame! 'Late 18th century' after reading so many books? Don't even know his birth year? Yes, I mean... ...err... You won't find Antony in pages of books, Google.com or black and white Bengali films, Rohit. You'll find printed letters... ...some dates, bits and pieces of lyrics. You'll find Uttam Kumar, the film star, and Manna Dey's voice and... ...you'll find the year he died in, 1836. But where's Antony? Where is he? Where? Here. At Pharashdanga. 1786, the year Lord Cornwaliis came to Calcutta, ...Antony was born to a salt merchant, Henysman. But the internet says... ...he was born in Portugal. He did come to India... - - Are you a Marwari? Huh? Marwari, Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati or... ...a non-residential Bengali? I am a Gujarati. But born and brought up in Kolkata. So was Antony. Portuguese Christian. Born and brought up in... ...Bengal. If you ever make it big, if you touch people's lives, you might find... ...erroneous information about you on the internet, after 150 years! But... ...what about Antony... - No time, isn't it? In a hurry? Not that. Go on. Please speak. I will have to speak. Or, gradually, I will... A lean Antony came to the world with a mole... ...on his right leg and his father's huge business. From childhood itself he did not get along with his brother, Kelly. Outside his bedroom there was a... ...Banyan tree. That was Antony's only friend. When water dripped from it's branches in the monsoons... ...Antony could see his mother... ...water dripping from her hair... ...Antony's mother passed away while giving birth to him. But how do you know these things? You don't find these in a history book. I know. Because I have seen. I see it everyday. Because I was there. Because I am Antony. Antony 'Phiringi' (foreigner). 150 years back, had looked for you, wanted to meet Tired and weary, had slept off in the darkness of the street And now you come looking for me 150 years back, had written songs in your praise Had washed my eyes with my mother tongue's watery haze And now you come looking for me 150 years back, had looked for you, wanted to meet Tired and weary, had slept off in the darkness of the street And now you come looking for me 150 years back, had written songs in your praise Had washed my eyes with my mother tongue's watery haze And now you come looking for me You are... ...Antony 'Phiringi'? What! - - Yes. I am Antony 'Phiringi'. Though... ...not in this birth. In this birth I am... ...Kushal Hajra. Assistant Librarian, Chandannagore Central Library. Salary; ten thousand rupees. I have rice in the morning and go to work. Are you trying to... I mean... ...what the fu... Rebirth? - - Don't be so flabbergasted, Rohit. The first time I saw myself I too was... ...shocked I choked out of fear. For a few hours had no memory from either of the births, complete black out. I was at Asansol back then. I had a good job at a private firm. The doctor said, I was getting nightmares due to work pressure. So I took leave for a few days and went to Hazaribag. One evening, I had gone for a walk. Far away at some temple, the evening chants were going on. Suddenly, had this vision, I saw... ...the royal family of Debs in Kolkata. The courtyard... ...Kabigaan... I am singing. So many people! Lights. The hall, the applause. And a hefty looking man came and put a garland... ...a garland around my neck... ...a garland... - - Mr. Kushal... Mr. Kushal... - - No. Mr. Kushal? The same story, the same visual year after year, like a movie. My birth... ...my childhood... ...getting addicted to Marijuana... ...then getting out of it. And Saudamini... And then Kabigaan. Gorokhhonath. Learning Bengali, writing songs in it. In the end... ...in the end... - - What? Nothing. I was used to the visions by then. And... ...through books and investigation, I... ...came across some names and places... ...through which I figured out who I was in my last birth. I also understood that... ...I can't continue with the job in Asansol for long... ...because my senior manager... ...had come to know that I had been visiting a psychiatrist. They created such a fuss... ...so I quit the job... ...and came and settled here. And this new job... ...am I mad? Yes, no... I mean... ...not quite... ...err... but... - You don't believe me? No. I too could not believe. After all, I'm a rational middle class Bengali engineer. I may be proud of Ritwik Ghatak having written... ...the film on reincarnation, 'Madhumati', or even be excited to watch Ray's film on reincarnation, 'Sonar Kella'. Heard of lan Stevenson? Famous Canadian bio-chemist and psychiatrist? 'Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation'? No. The case of Shanti Devi who was declared to be... ...a 'Jatiswar' by a scienctific commission set up by Mahatma Gandhi? Jatis... - - Jatiswar. Someone who has memories from previous birth. But... - ...I know. Not just Shanti Devi... ...hundreds of such cases or... ...thousands of scientific reports would still keep... ...would've not had any effect on my cynicism had this not happened to me. So you see, Rohit, what is 'somehow', 'but'... ...'if', 'maybe'... to me it is a real disease. A persistent feeling of deja vu, ...a curse. A curse? Rather, you're lucky. How can you say such childish things! What's wrong with you? I lost my job! I had to leave my city. You are saying I'm lucky? Faces, incidents, problems of both the... ...births are jumbling up my mind and... ...you're saying I'm lucky? I'll not be able to have this conversation after a few months, ...and you're saying I am lucky? - - No... err... What I meant was actually... - - What do you mean? What? Gradually, Antony is eating up... ...the memories of this brith. The visions are increasing. I'm forgetting who I am, which language I speak in, how to lead a life in... ...in the year 2013... When I experience these visions... ...my blood pressure increases. Twice! I have had a stroke twice! And you will still say that I am... I know... ...what my disease is... ...but I don't know... ...what the cure is, how long I'll be able to survive this way. I don't even know... ...how long I'll be able to remember that I'm... ...Kushal Hajra. My previous birth's memories... ...are spreading in my mind... ...like cancer. I'm melting in to the dark and still you'll say I am... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Can I suggest something? Come to Kolkata with me. You know the disease, not the remedy. So, let's go and see the best psychiatrist in town. Then let's see if we can save Kushal Hajra from Antony 'Phiringi'. Don't worry about the expenses. I'll take care of it. And in any case, in return... ...I need something from you. So, don't worry. No favors are being done here. What? You'll have to... ...tell me the entire... ...story of Antony. I need it for my dissertation. And may be... ...for my life. Intermission. Hello, we're now with the fifth documentation of the coursework. It has been about seven days we've come to Kolkata. I have already had two sessions with Mr. Kushal. And we've covered most of Antony's early life. The plan is to gather as much information as possible about Antony... ...before we can cross-check for authenticity with historical sources. So today, we'll look into the musical career of Heynsman Antony. Somehow Antony had been able to... ...come out of the infamous company of weed-smokers. Slowly, he had started with his music. Kabigaan was very popular back in those times. So, to listen to Kabigaan for the first time... ...Antony went to... ...'Raja' (zamindar) Gopi Mohan Deb's court. Shovabajar, courtyard. The Kabigaan fight was between veteran bard, Horu Thakur... ...and his ex-students Nilu Thakur and Bhawani Bene's group. Inspite of having many students, ...Horu Thakur's favourite student was... ...Bhola 'Moyra' (sweetmeat maker). Which is why Nilu Thakur and Bhawani Bene's ...were very jealous of him. So, the group of students disintegrated. They formed a new group. It was... ...midnight. Horu Thakur... ...started singing. Only if I had known beforehand, my friend That Lord Krishna's emotion is indeed a venomous potion Only if I had known beforehand, my friend That Lord Krishna's emotion is mixed with a venomous potion Only if I had known beforehand, my friend The Honoured, my friends, in all innocence, Wouldn't have been deceived in this way The Honoured, my friends, in all innocence, Wouldn't have been deceived in this way Only if I had known beforehand, my friend That Lord Krishna's emotion is indeed a venomous potion Only if I had known beforehand, my friend Just after Horu Thakur's Sakhisangbad got over... - - Sorry. Sakhisangbad... what's that? A part of Kabigaan. There were mainly five rounds in a Kabigaan duel. Bhawani bishayak... ...where various songs were sung about Goddess Uma or Durga. Sakhisangbad... ...which was about Radha and Krishna's love story in Vrindavan. Viraha... ...written about normal people, sad love songs. Kheur... ...songs about gods and goddesses... ...which had frivolous, sometimes rather... ...indecent lyrics. And Lahar, direct personal attack. Insulting the opponent by singing the most indecent of verses. Thanks. Please continue. Brilliant! Salutations! Nilu Thakur realized that Horu Thakur had impressed the 'Raja' and the audience... ...much before he reached Kheur round. So, instead of singing Kheur... ...he sang Lahar and started insulting Horuthakur with his vulgar verses. But that did not help. According to the Raja and the public's verdict, Horu Thakur won. And Antony acquired a new passion. Kabigaan. But... ...it must have been very difficult. Err... I mean... ...I know that Antony... ...had been hearing Bengali all around him since childhood, he could even speak it. But... ...writing songs in that language... - - Of course it was difficult. Initially he used to speak Sanskritized Bengali... ...because he had learn it from the books. Later, by interacting with the natives... ...as in the villagers... ...he learnt the colloquial version too. He had written songs but in Protuguese, not yet in Bengali. And then... ...something struck him. The main topic of songs back then were... ...Vaishnav and Shakto Padabali, as in... ...Radha, Krishna, Uma, Menoka... and many more... ...of such gods and goddesses from the Puranas. He began by learning Sanskrit from a tutor at home. After all, the Language of the Gods. It took time. But he had learnt Latin from his father as a kid, so... ...though he faced problems initially, gradually he picked up. After learning Sanskrit Antony felt like he had... ...opened a door with a key. He discovered a huge, ancient, magical universe. He had heard of it but never seen it. But he could see it now. He started reading 'Shastras' (holy scriptures). Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, Upapuranans, he read everthing. He had music in him. He learnt the topic and the language of the songs. But to understand how that language morphed into lyrics of a song he started listening to Bengali folk music. Jhumur, Panchali, Murshidi, Bhawaiya, he'd go land up anywhere and everywhere. He listened carefully. And... ...he'd be on the look out for Kabigaan duels. He'd rush to the venue, wherever it was, village or the city. Bhola Moyra, Keshta 'Muchi' (cobbler), Thakur Singha, Ram Basu, these guys were the masters. Is he a Hindu God? Or a Muslim Peer? Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me! Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me! So now you understand, this Horu Thakur of yours is not the Lord Krishna we know He's the universe while this one's a retard, dense and slow This one's a retard, dense and slow! This one's a retard, dense and slow! During that time Antony had been to Kumarkhali to listen to Fakiri music. A student of Shiraj Shah, had become very famous. No one's interested in the truth No one's interested in the truth Only brouhaha, meaningless Rancour, in the name of caste Is indeed a strange business Rancour, in the name of caste One who visits the whore on the sly Is called faithless, I wonder why - Listening to his music Antony understood, even after the melody, the lyrics and the topic of the song, a huge component remains. The philosophy. Lalon wonders what indeed is caste Lalon wonders Fakir Lalon wonders Lalon wonders Lalon wonders what indeed is caste A strange deception which never ceases Rancour, in the name of caste Is indeed a strange business Rancour, in the name of caste No one's interested in the truth At a point he realized a 'Dnarakabi' group was... - - Sorry. 'Dnarakabi'? Ameteur bards. As in... ...you could say, an amateur group. So, Antony thought of forming an amateur group. Which is when he met... ...an upcoming 'Bnadhandaar'. Gorokhhonath. Sorry... ...'Bnadhandar' was the person who would compose the lyrics for the bard. It's not that all bards would sing songs written by themselves. The groups often had 'Bnadhandars'. So you're coming? Hope there will be some depressing snacks for lunch? For sure. And some fat books on Bengali literature to be used as paper weights. Fine then. I'll have a look at my schedule. We need to screen a lot of bands. We need to separate the wheat from the chaff. Yes. More than a thousand bands have registered. And the judges will be divided into groups to screen them. Your remuneration? Everything depends on my work pressure. There will be a bit of work pressure at that time... ...but I'll definitely try to make it. I'll be happy to judge. Okay listen, when you go to meet Rupam, please take me with you, I think he's very cute. You haven't heard Rupam Islam music enough to find him cute. Shut up, moron! Oh please! - -Hello brother... ...we're hungry. Come fast. Listen, get us one Keema Matar, one Chicken Bharta, two boneleess Mutton tadkas, and Nan for any of you? None of us. Four Tawa rotis, we'll tell you if we need more. And one Masala cold drink, without lime. Salad? Onions? - - No! You can find mouth freshners in India, you know. No, you see... onions aren't good for health. Don't overdo it. You'll have to see a doctor eventually! What you need more than a doctor, Mr. Hajra... ...is rest. These hallucinations, visions or nightmares; whatever you call them, if they keep increasing then it's going to take a toll on your... - - Heart. Tell me something new, doctor. Something I don't know. Like... ...will this ever get cured? Will it ever... - -See... ...I've spoken to three internationally acclaimed... ...parapsychologists regarding your problem. I've had a detailed discussion with Dr. Debasish Ghosh here as well. Let me explain. This part of the brain is called Hippocampal gyrus. This is our memory centre. New and old, all memories are stored here. Now this Hippocampalgyrus... ...can be aroused in many ways. Like... ...ringing bells in temple chants, chanting of the word 'Om' etc. ...all of these generate 3.5 Hz brainwave. At this 3.5 Hz... ...Hippocampal gyrusstarts resonating. During that, the old memory, even past life memory may come back. Now the second possible explanation. There's a gland called the Pineal gland here, which is called, the Third eye. Now, we don't know how or why this gets aroused but if it does... ...your lost memory may suddenly come back. The third explanation is, genetic memory. Carl Jung said, 'Collective unconscious'. We're all connected to each other in some way or the other... ...via our DNA. This too is possible that you may have a genetic connect... ...with the person, whose memories have come back to you. Whatever that may be... ...now the problem is, the memories that are coming back to you... ...if they keep increasing in frequency and intensity, it may subvert your present memory and... ...turn these memories into your dominant memories. And during this, not only schizophrenia and split personality, ...there's a chance of identity crisis or memory replacement too. - - Just a minute. Can you explain this in an easier language. As in, how long will his normal memory last? As in, before he... - - Before I lose himself. Well, difficult to say. Matters of the brain, you see. May take weeks or even a year. Depends on the rate of replacement by the dominant memory. See, due to the neural plasticity of the Hippocampus, a consolidation of memory occurs. May lead to a regression too. As in, this growth may become slower. It may even come to a halt one fine day. Yes! But how? Avery common and easy way is reconciliation. As in revisiting the places and the people whom you see in the visions. No, that's not working. That's why I shifted to Chandannagore from Asansol but it increased. Next... as in is there another way? There is another way. Past life regression. Do you have any trauma from your past life... ...that had given you a big shock? Or a very important task that you couldn't complete? Mr. Hajra, were you looking for someone or something? Or are you still searching? Don't worry, I think whatever had happened... ...I think you must not worry about this. Things will get better. You... - - Hey wait! Stop the car! Stop! - -What happened? What happened Mr. Kushal... ...where are you going! Mr. Kushal... Don't go Mr. Kushal! Wait! What are you doing? Leave me! He's... ...okay fine. Pull over. Pull over. Mr. Kushal! Give way, will you? Greetings, sahib. Some cash is required to build the wall on the North. So Madam asked me to tell you. - - Come and take it tomorrow. So, where is she? She was here a while ago. Should I... - - That won't be necessary. I will find Soudamini myself. Mr. Kushal... ...what are you looking at? Let's go! Mr. Kushal... Mr. Kushal, come with me. Come on, let's leave! Amitabh and Sudeshna have settled down too. At least now you must look for someone. Love is incapable of taming me. And I can't settle down with someone. I'll have to unsettle up. Why? Sujit was a nice guy. Waste of time. And Amiya? - - Casting pearls before swine. Oh really! And you are such a pearl! Human Elsa. Born Free. That's enough! Arguing all the time. Switch on the Bengali channel on the TV. My serial is about to begin. What's this? Have you really gone mad? Why this Gujarati channel? Asked you to switch on the Bengali channel. Mom, when did you realize that Dad's case was real? Huh? Real? - - Hmm. It's not an infatuation or a passing phase... ...it's the real thing. True love... ...and all that jazz. On my way back from the crematorium... Mr. Kushal... ...come. What? Come inside. Sit. Tell me. Any problem? Can't get sleep? Sorry. Sorry? For what? I mean... ...anything could've happened on the road. Because of... ...I lost myself. Don't even think about it, Mr. Kushal. Losing yourself for something, I know how that feels. It's not always in your control. Thank you. What are you writing? All that I've... ...read... ...learnt... ...understood... felt... all these years... ...now they want to come out. What is it? A song? Want to listen to it? This is the first draft. Written for someone very special. Okay. So... ...what's her name? As they say... ...everything is 'Maya' (illusion). Into my life, Out of the blue, Did you arrive, Tell me, did you? My broken life, It's frayed brink, Of city-days', just at the kink, Into my life, Out of the blue, Did you arrive, Tell me, did you? My broken life, It's frayed brink, Of city-days', just at the kink, Did you arrive, Tell me, did you? Alas no more You will get here, A thing you can, Consider dear, With ease. O where was I Going as such, From where was I Expecting much, With ease. Now simple words, Are hardly that, Survival's prime Simple format. My broken life, It's frayed brink, Of city-days', just at the kink, Into my life, Out of the blue, Did you arrive, Tell me, did you? Into my life, Out of the blue, Did you arrive, Tell me, did you? This is how I... ...met her for the first time. I mean... ...Antony met Soudamini for the first time. Cinematic stuff. You could say so. Where's your... ...camera? Didn't record this? No. Not this one. Perfect! I want to go home! Hello. I want to register for Bandemonium. Here's my entry. Another weirdo! Details please. Hmmm. Nice body! Details, as in? - - As in your name, your father's name, your manager's name. Antony. Henysman Antony. Damned Anglo-Indian for sure! Woah! What a sexy name! Which college? Or university? Humboldt university. Sorry. Humboldt university, second year. Portuguese studies. How many members in the band? Members? Err... ...I am alone. Oh God! This is a band show, not a solo. Wasted my time... read and come next time. No, but I... - - Now please go! I've a lot of work to do. Now go! Please go will you? Band of idiots! Excuse me. What now? - - Take down the band's name. What! - - The band's name. Pharashdanga Graduate band. What 'danga'? I clearly remember my... I mean... ...sorry... ...Antony's first Kabigaan fight. The opponent was the famous female bard, Jogyeshwari. Rumour was... ...she was Ram Basu's girlfriend. Wow! Bob Dylan-Joan Baez of that era? Wow. I see that Sahib has come in the guise of a Bengali. Yes. Just like you've come in the guise of a woman. Since you have become my soul mate Let me confide in you, Since you have become my soul mate Let me confide in you, A glance at your face and I get over my blues A glance at your face and I get over my blues Since you have become my soul mate Let me confide in you, Imprisoned by love, slow and surely I get tamed The 'virtuos' woman that I am, what am I without a husband? Imprisoned by love, slow and surely I get tamed The 'virtuos' woman that I am, what am I without a husband? Forsake your home, be it spring or monsoon, Deny the pious and satiate me soon. Since you have become my soul mate Let me confide in you, Since you have become my soul mate Let me confide in you, A glance at your face and I get over my blues Since you have become my soul mate Let me confide in you, Since you have become my soul mate Let me confide in you, Brilliant! Salutations! Just edit that bit. I think there's some problem in the monitoring. Can you hear it? Yes. In that case, you know how humans growl? I want that sort of a growl, like a human or a beast, you get it? And practice the scatting bit too. Antony's group had just started the 'Jill'. 'Jill'? Jacking me with jargons again? Sorry. 'Jill'... it is like a commencement... ...with instruments like 'dhol' and 'kasha'. As in... ...like musically challenging your opponent. As soon as that happened, I, as in Antony, started getting tense. It was the first duel after all. But the moment I, I mean Antony stood up... ...the moment he started singing the Viraha written by Gorokkho... ...that was it. The public, the judge and the opponet went mute. The first time when you went on stage... ...did you have stage fright? - - My first performance... ...there have been many kinds of first times. But yes, speaking of stage frights... ...let me tell you about the first time I performed my songs, when I got on stage to perform my own songs the first time, I was scared. But then... ...the dark silhouetted heads of the audience... ...the blinding lights... ...the microphone's metalic echo... ...set everything right. Not anymore, my love, don't come in my way Not anymore, my love, don't come in my way Not anymore, my love, don't come in my way Not anymore, my love, don't come in my way Can't understand your visits Please pay heed to what I say Not anymore, my love, don't come in my way Not anymore, my love, don't come in my way Gorokhho! Gorokhho! Gorokhho! Mr. Kushal... Mr. Kushal... Who is it? Gorokkho? You're here finally? You lowly money minded swine! Mr. Kushal... - Why do you decieve like a woman? How greedy can you get! Listen... - - Don't you know what I've lost? Don't you know Kelly cheated me off my property. You may be my 'Bnadhandar' but... ...I too can compose songs for duels if it comes to that, remember! Mr. Kushal... I am... Now go! Get lost! You nasty maggot! Go away! You greedy dog! Get lost from here! Go away! Mr. Kushal... Mr. Kushal... please! See, I have already committed to a duel in Chinsura. Our group has earned a bit of a reputation. This one last time, after that I'll... Mr. Kushal... ...pay you the price you want. The salary you ask for. Mr. Kushal! Geta hold on yourself! It's me! I'm Rohit. I'm Rohit, Mr. Kushal. Mr. Kushal... What's wrong with you? Mr. Kushal? Rohit. Camera. Losing out on time. I'm... ...sinking fast. Because Gorokhhonath refused to compose lyrics for me... ...I myself had to start composing for the Kabigaan duels. And after composing my first song... ...I never had to look back. It was my... ...first duel with Ram Basu. What are your devious ways, O Goddess, of ignoring me? Will you have mercy on me, finally? I am a foreigner by birth, O Goddess Hence you ignore me and go away I am a foreigner by birth, O Goddess I don't know how to chant and pray I don't know how to pray to you, so my prayers go unanswered I don't know how to pray to you, so my prayers go unanswered So the foreigner will seek your blessings Matangi, Till his voice his heard The Goddess Matangi blessed me. I had already beaten Jogyeshwari. Later I beat Ram Basu, Keshta Muchi, Jogeshwar 'Dhopa' (washerman) and even Thakur Singha. Tell me, O Antony, could you please kindly explain Having come to my country, why aren't you dressed like clergymen? Tell me, O Antony, could you please kindly explain Having come to my country, why aren't you dressed like clergymen? Tell me, O Antony Tell me, O Antony, where are your shoes and boots and socks Tell me, O Antony, where are your shoes and boots and socks It seems you favour our sandals more Could you solve this little paradox? Could you solve this little paradox? Tell me, O Antony, could you please kindly explain Having come to my country, why aren't you dressed like clergymen? Tell me, O Antony Well done! Brilliant! I'm quite happy in my Bengalin my fancy Bengali dress Being Thakur Singha's son-in-law have forsaken my foreign ways I'm quite happy in my Bengalin my fancy Bengali dress Being Thakur Singha's son-in-law have forsaken my foreign ways Father-in-laws and son-in-laws have common ways, you see Father-in-laws and son-in-laws have common ways, you see I belong to the soil of Bengal and Bengal belongs to me I belong to the soil of Bengal and Bengal belongs to me Bengal belongs to him! Bengal belongs to him! Not only Viraha, Kheur and Lahar, my most popular genre was the... ...the welcome songs of Mother Goddess Durga. Hail O Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency Hail O Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency One who invokes you, O Mother Durga You take care of his destiny Hence I cry out to you, O Mother, in this mortal world I cry out in distress But you pay no heed to your son, O Mother Why are you so heartless? Admitted, I have been a bad son But why will you be a bad mother? Like you were born of a stone You behave like no other Tell me, O Merciful one, tell me Will I have your blessing eventually? Tell me, O Merciful one, tell me Will I have your blessing eventually? Brilliant! Well done! Welll done! Hello brother! - - When? Where? How? Slow down. Too many questions at one go. Holy Christ! You've got a huge place! So, Mr. Disco Dandia, what's up with you? Your Mr. Disco Dandia has taken to Raybne she dancing now. Oh my God! What have you done? Which Bengali cleansed your Bengali pronunciation? I'm surely sending Gaby to you. - - Not a Bengali. A Portuguese. - - What! Close your mouth, a fly may get in. Can you give me some weed? Though after this, a couple of reefers would've had the same effect. Hey, listen... I just want to meet Uncle Reincarnate once, please! Please! - - He is sleeping. And he isn't keeping well, too. Okay. Obviously that happens later then. And what's going on with your music? Have you been able to serenade Maya yet? I've got a chance. - - Okay. As in... like a show. You know... Radio Mirchi? They're doing a concert. She's the main organizer. I've been selected also. But there's a hitch. - - Hitch? I lied during the registration that I have a band. Or they wouldn't allow. And I don't know anybody in the band circuit. At least if I could get some musicians... - Or leave it to the hands. Right? Don't worry. We'll arrange something. I will take you to someone. My senior from the Medical college days here. Like a friend. I think he'll be able to guide you well. Don't worry. The decision has to be taken today itself. Of course. We've to... - - That's why I came. We need to finish this. Remember everybody. Listen to me everyone. Let's listen to what he has to say. Then we speak. Here he comes. Wait. Hello brothers. - - Listen, you untouchable, you've married a Hindu girl rescuing her from the Sati pyre. We've not said anything. You've been breaking all rules. Respected people in the village have lost their caste because of you. We didn't say anything. But today when we heard... - Will you stop listing his blasphemies and get to the point? Fine, I'll get to it. Today we heard you're planning to organize a Durga Puja! That's true. - - Then listen... ...this Puja will not happen. - - Why? We're staying here, at the outskirts of the village without bothering anyone. - - Shut up! We've already told you this puja won't... - Go inside, Mini. Go in. Listen Antony Sahib, I'll tell you why this Puja cannot happen. You're a Christian by birth. Moreover you're poking your nose into our traditions, our customs, even our festivals! Even the Viceroy would not have dared that! A crow doesn't turn into a peacock putting on a peacock's feather. And an amateur poet doesn't become a Bengali by singing a few Kheur songs. And Durga Puja? That's our very own... ...Bengali festival. Therefore... - - Listen brothers, Goddess Mahamaya herself decides... ...who is a Bengali and who isn't. I am just a humble devotee. Worshipping her is my duty. I will do that. You may do anything you want to, I don't mind at all. Goodbye. What I am thinking is... ...I am a judge at the same competition... Will it be correct if I guide you? I don't have any interest in... ...in competing there. I just want to sing this song for someone there. If need be declare an out of competition... - - Just a minute. Sing it for 'someone' as in? The same cardiac case everywhere. Well well! Good! In that case I'll say that your song is very nice... ...I really liked it. A unique composition. I got a very special feeling in it. So it's better not to approach it with a typical... ...drums, bass guitar, guitar, keyboard set up. So... ...what do you suggest? How you should arrange this song, how you should present it, I think there is only one person in Kolkata. If he agrees to help you, you're done. You'll get a set of musicians and... ...then if he agrees to play along, nothing like it. Do one thing, I'll give him a call and speak to him. Then you can go, meet him. Sing him your songs. And that's it. Thank you Sidhu, I didn't imagine you'll help us like this. Don't be so formal. I've been in college too, isn't it? And in such cardiac cases my emotion works a little more. Rita from NRS and Bodhi from National college... ...when they had just begun, I've contributed a lot in that. Fine. Who's this person? All arrangements will be made on time. Only you won't be there. I know, you've become very famous now. You're very busy. Fine, one day when you come back... ...you'll find my dead body lying here. Then I'll kill myself and lie down in the grave beside you. No. That won't happen. Why will I be buried because I married you? I will be cremated. Will you stop? I have duels on all the three evenings of Durga Puja. And on the last night... ...I'm competing with Bhola Moyra, at Sovabajar. And that's a duel I... ...had to fight. With this the last chapter of my life began. My... ...last Kabigaan duel. Even a birth later... ...when those incidents... ...emerge in my mind just like a film... ...I... When I reached 'Raja' Gopi Mohan Deb's palace that evening, I saw, it was a huge affair. Bhola Moyra was waiting therewith his group to attack me. We took our seats. The competition began. As the night fell, the fight became tougher. Both sides got equal appreciation from the Raja and public... ...in Bhawani Bishayak, Sakhisangbad and Viraha. So it was obvious that the judgement would be made in... ...the Kheur and Lahar rounds. Here you are. I needed to talk to you, there's a problem. I'll have to reach the venue directly from the airport on that day. No problem. There will be a car waiting. That's very good. A nothing thing... the main thing... ...how's the participation looking like? Some very good bands have registered. Looks like it'll be a tough fight. Come. Love engulfs the soul, Love engulfs the soul In faraway lands you roam, I come back to an empty home In faraway lands you roam, I come back to an empty home The heart explodes, I worry and fret, And grapple with my lovesick state Love engulfs the soul As the mind is on a roll, Love engulfs the soul Love engulfs the soul Love engulfs the soul Look who's here! Mr. Coward Lee! How are you? Still studying or that's finally over? Still going on. Nice. Still learning Bengali or have you shifted to Hebrew to impress girls? No. Still trying my luck at Bengali. Maya. Even today. Where to? We've come to Sidhu's house. There's a concert on the 21st. I need passes. Oh God! Now I'll have to meet you at Bengali music concerts as well? So be it. Keep a Bengali to English dictionary handy. Fulfill by experiencing Krishna within yourself, and be sure to avoid his touch Lest misfortune befalls you before your union, And you miss him again as much. And you miss him again as much. O Moon-faced one, besotted with the Lord That your pining end with devotion, overawed Don't worry, O Radha, your pangs of separation have ceased By the prancing flautist now, you will hence have your heart seized! Don't worry, O Radha Don't worry, O Radha Don't worry, O Radha What's this crap you smoke! Saw dust and wood scrap. Smoke something nice if you have to. I still remember... ...smoking the hookah with my Grandpa. Are you down? Tea? - - No! Nothing's wrong with me and I don't want anything. You snap at me exactly like your father used to. Only, you have better teeth. Who's the guy? Or is it a girl? Mom! Why not? Better if it's a girl, less complicated. He used to study in our university. Gujarati fellow. I shunned him because he was a huge nag and very clingy. Met him a few days back. Looks like he's still the same. Still as clingy? Hope he does not love you. - - What! Mom, please! No, I am just asking. Anyway. In a few days your concert will begin. You'll get busy. You won't have the time to think about all this. These incorrigible, irritating lads! Disgusting! Now will you care for a cup of tea? It's about to rain. Come downstairs. A misfit schitzo, a hunted torso And the 'I'-ego Let it grow What's the harm in that? And a fellatio Each rumour's ratio Rude?

Salutations! Well done! Brilliant! Coming up next to perform, Pharashdanga Graduate band! Thank you. Thanks to all of you. Wherever I am today, for that I am... ...extremely grateful to a lot of people. Among them I want to specially mention three names. One. Sidhu. Thank you Sidhu, thank you so much. Two. Kabir Suman, without whose help I wouldn't have reached here. He has arranged this song of mine with a lot of love. And three. The one who is the inspiration for this song, the one whom I have loved, who has encouraged me, ...to dare to come here, the one, to whom this song is dedicated... ...that name is... ...the entire family of Radio Mirchi. Who is this 'you' that I behold, Who holds a mirror in her eyes, Why is it that when I caress you, This 'you' inexplicably cries... Who is this 'you' that I behold, Who holds a mirror in her eyes, Why is it that when I caress you, This 'you' inexplicably cries... Birth and re-birth, the cycle goes on, As your memory echoes in time, Like ancient melodies of our land, In today's tunes they chyme Birth and re-birth, the cycle goes on, As your memory echoes in time, Like ancient melodies of our land, In today's tunes they chyme Come and fill up my silence, With alphabets of sighs Why is it that when I caress you, This 'you' inexplicably cries... Who is this 'you' that I behold, Who holds a mirror in her eyes, Why is it that when I caress you, This 'you' inexplicably cries... In some birth I was the poet Jaidev, and you were Padmavati, The forgotten tales of scriptures which Cry like you incessantly... In some birth I was the poet Jaidev, and you were Padmavati, The forgotten tales of scriptures which Cry like you incessantly... And in each teardrop, I die and am born again As recounting tales of many births, is your silent pain And in each teardrop, I die and am born again As recounting tales of many births, is your silent pain You've poured yourself on me before, Drench me like rain from the skies, Why is it that when I caress you, This 'you' inexplicably cries... Who is this 'you' that I behold, Who holds a mirror in her eyes, Why is it that when I caress you, This 'you' inexplicably cries... Who is this 'you' that I behold, Who holds a mirror in her eyes, Why is it that when I caress you, This 'you' inexplicably cries... Yes. May I come in? Sure. You went off key twice and you missed the beat once as well. Though you can always say it was all... ...intentional. Not only that. My pronunciation of 'S' isn't perfect yet. My 'R' is still like a non residential Bengali and maybe... ...sometimes I say 'O' instead of an 'Aw'. I'm sorry. Can I get another year? Last chance. My mother is waiting outside to meet you. A couple of friends are waiting too. Should I call them? - - Yeah... of... ...of course. Err... obviously. I too have somebody I want you to meet. Just a second. Hello, Mr. Kushal... Birju? How do you have his phone? Gave it to you and left? As in? When? Where did he go? You don't know? This is ridiculous! The man is unwell. He just disappeared? Don't you have any responsibility? What do you mean? Go look for him. When did he leave? Go look for him outside! Right now! Idiot! Mr. Kushal! You got me so worried! You just left without telling anyone? Anyway, Mr. Kushal... ...I want you to meet someone special. I told you about Maya... ...this is Mahamaya. Hello, Mr. Kushal. Heard a lot... Hail O Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency Hail O Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency Hail O Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency Hail O Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency Mr. Kushal? Hail O Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency Hail O Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency Mr. Kushal? Mr. Kushal, don't do this! Please, Mr. Kushal! Mr. Kushal, listen to me. Mr. Kushal, I'm Rohit. Mr. Kushal! - - Mistake! You've come to the wrong bard. I am not Kushal. I am Antony. Antony 'Phiringi'. Shit! - - Antony 'Phiringi'... Mr. Kushal, look at me! Look at me, Mr. Kushal. You live here. You are a librarian in Chadannagore. Mr. Kushal, you're a librarian, you used to stay in Asansol. Mr. Kushal, you have past life memories! Mr. Kushal? Come on, look at me! - - Hey! Who are you? Who sent you? Who has sent you? Come on, tell me! Who sent you? Hey! That worthless village headman sent you, right? Aren't you done yet, even after killing my Mini? You've finished us! We're homeless now! What do you want now? Tell me or I'll kill you! Tell me who has sent you? 'Raja' Gopi Mohan Deb! 'Raja' Gopi Mohan Deb! 'Raja'? The Raja sent you? You should've told me earlier! I am so sorry! I did not recognize you. Oh no! I am so sorry. I've really lost it after Mini's death. Anyway, what's gone is gone. But I can't ignore Goddess Saraswati's blessings, can I? There will be death, there will be old age... but work is work. I am a bard after all. Isn't it? So you've come to invite me? Who's on the other side? Surely Bhola? I knew he won't let go. Horu Thakur's disciple, he definitely has an ego! - - We lost him. Can he forget how I beat him in front of the Raja? He must be sitting somewhere, singing, I'm not the Bhola you pray to, I'm not the creator Horu's disciple from the city I'm the sweetmeat maker, He's not the Bhola you pray to, he's not the creator Horu's disciple from the city, he's the sweetmeat maker, Hello. Dr. Sengupta? I desire not to be immortal, Have no other wishes too,? The only drive of my mortal stint, Is merely wanting you. Moments pass like previous births, Reincarnating fast, Alphabets just fade away, like The memories from the past. Torn pages of scriptures, sighing, The wind just rustles through, The only drive of my mortal stint, Is merely wanting you. Lokhkhinodor's myth dances on a, Cobra's outstretched hood, Our tradition never did allow For Behula's widowhood. The rafts float by, carrying along The corpses, all the same, Have been looking for you for many days now to tell you just this... ...sorry Maya, I should have stayed back that day. I have been born, a myriad times, Have died before, on your lap, Just to see you once more, I have Embraced this re-birth's trap. Time and again, we have come back, To the Earth, the calling's strong, Sometime Gangur, or Kopai, even, In Kopotakhkho's song. Gangur turned into Cauvery, and Often Mississipi too, Rhine and Congo, as rivers wrote Their music whole life through. I will not, I, have never written Down music ever before, Let wanting you reflect, in folk Songs' unwritten score. When I fell in love with you, A thousand births ago, Buddha painted his loneliness? In the evening glow. His kindness had you wander in Solitude, begging for alms, And I yearned for an yearning you, As I met those outstretched palms. On my knees, those times found me, I am still on my knees, Come bewitch with eyes, with palms Outstretched in dreams, come please. Place your lips on my parched lips, Let's build a barricade new, I swear by the Revolt and Love, I only desire you. Enchanted by my dreams, you had, Taken births endlessly, I was your scream, your desire and Revolution, your fury. Whenever pain had touched you, know That, that touch was my hand, I am your man, I am your roots, I am your motherland. Whenever you had borne a child, It's father was my desire,? Lost count of our children who Have lit our crimson pyre. We come back, 'n' we come again Each time, we go back too, Will come again, declare again, I only desire you. We come back, 'n' we come again Each time, we go back too, Will come again, declare again, I only desire you.
