I'll send the tape to the Police. But if you do, I won't release it. You know, until or if you're caught. Look. Children. Digging holes. Fathers watching their children. But who watches the mothers?. Do you, um, do you like children?. I like mothers better. So, why should I believe you?. I wanna do this documentary. Serial killers, you know, when they're caught the media, you know, they portray them as-- [muffled voices] monsters, animals. I wanna show that, you know, you're human, and, you know, show your thoughts and you have feelings. And, um, I wanna preserve you. What if I decide my next victim is you?. I don't fit your profile. Hm. That little red light means it's capturing me?. Yeah. Means its recording. You brought a book. What is it?. Blake, huh?. You read a lot of philosophy?. Well, you don't, Mickey?. Mick. Please, not Mickey. Mick. It actually was one of my majors. Hm, what college?. You have any favorites?. Philosophers?. You didn't bring me here to talk philosophy. How old were you when you started?. Started what?. Six. Six? Can you, uh, tell me about it?. You never tortured an animal?. Me? No. But you read philosophy. I don't see the connection. Hm. What kind of animal was it?. Why don't you take a guess, Mick?. A dog. No. A cat. Very good. How? I stoned it to death. When I got older, I nailed them to trees. You like hearing about tortures, don't you?. No. Yeah, you do. No. So, it gave you a sense of power. Yeah, like you behind that camera with the little red light in a safe hotel room with the door open. You wanna hear a lot of gruesome stories? Is that what you want? I can read about those in the newspaper. They don't print everything, believe me. What's with the eyes?. You take your victims eyes out. It's your signature. They're your trophies, aren't they?. Where do you keep them?. You know what?. I have to go. It's time for me to feed my cats. He's a sick motherfucker. Nobody's ever done what I'm doing, Gino. Yeah.

How about accomplice for the murder you caught on tape? Gino, chill out. Im gonna turn his ass in in a couple of days. He could be out there hacking people up as we speak. I've got the tape and he knows it. And he slipped up and he knows that too because I tracked him down. This documentary is gonna launch our careers, man. You have some better plan to get out of this shit life?. How many days before you turn him in?. Why are you locking the door? I always lock my door. But you are what people are afraid could get in. [meow] No, baby, no, no, no, no. Come with daddy. I know. Look what I got for her. Cats, huh?. Just poured some juice. You care for some?. No, lm allergic. What's the baby jars for?.

[door buzzer] Mommy's here. I wanna stay here. T ell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna leave this board exactly the way it is. I think somebody wants an express ride down them stairs. [imitates engine] Say goodbye to Mickey. Goodbye, Mickey. [wood creaks] Hey. So, who was that?. It's just some kid I help out at the hospital once in a while. It's just rest in peace bullshit. An urn. That's an urn?. Better be. My mother's ashes are in there. Your mother?. Well, shall we begin?. Okay, one second. All right. How do you choose which ones? Its a-- A special glow they have. Its as if they choose me. What do you mean? [shouts] What do I do with the bodies?. You're askin' me to pull my pants down, Mick. I don't think that's gonna happen. Not tonight. Conscience is a sickbed. Under its filthy sheets lie all of our fears. Its not conscience that prevents men from killing and raping. Its the consequence. Fear of death, jails, God. But really where is he? Does he hear his name when theyre screaming? Do they return on peace by peace when I finish with them? The moment that God strikes me down, lll smile because lll believe in him for the first time. [woman on TV] Is there a surprise for me?. What are you doing? Come on to the back. What're you gonna do in there?. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?. Shh. Hey, hey. Listen, listen! Listen. You don't touch anybody, you don't hurt anybody while I'm around. You understand me?. Shit. [whispers] She's just got them cooking breakfast. Remember to put your camera on or you can miss some good stuff. Come here. What the fuck are you doing?. What the fuck are you doing?. [shouting] (woman) You asshole! Jesus Christ. And who the hell are you?. That's Mickey. Oh, hi, Mickey. Mick. Meet my big sister Megan. What's with the camera?. He's doing a movie on me. On you?. Why?. He's capturing all my transgressions. With your heart it's a wonder you ain't been canonized a saint by now. It's the kids, ain't it?. It's the charity stuff. This is Jimmy with the cancer kids. Jimmy playing Santa. Oh, God. It's Melissa. I remember the poor thing could hardly walk. This was the last photo of her. God bless you, Melissa. That reminds me. I need to get some childhood photos of you. Here. This is cute. Jimmy's graduation. The Jersey shore. Why is this womans face cut out? I, um, I wanna show you something. Come on. It all-- It all started here. Let me focus. Look. I thought I would die and no one would know what she did to me. The hours I spent strapped to these pipes. My God. If these wall could talk, they'd cry. Oh. What you got there? [whispers] The proof that I was alive. Jim. [jumbled voices] [kids voice] I was here. If someone finds this, will you please remember me? Do you remember when I asked you if you could stop killing? And you said that if the seeds were never buried in darkness-- Were never planted, that l might be able to recapture the innocence I never had. I wondered. Who planted those seeds?. She took you down and left you there, huh?. Who?. Who told you that?. Did you take me down to that cell to justify what you do?. Not everything is to your fucking benefit, Mick. Right. You know, it just seems that-- Seems like what?. What?. What, do you think I'm killing my mother?. Yeah, it's obvious. I mean, in your mind you think you are, but in reality you're killing the innocent. Do me a favor, all right?. Remove those eight women from the equation. How do you remove eight women lying in pools of their own blood with their eyes taken out?. Am I beneath compassion?. What?. What compassion did you have?. I'm just asking. Just try to remove them from the equation. [shouts] It's not an equation. It's life!. It's body identifications. It's funerals. It's families torn apart! It's mom's takin' sleeping pills praying to God when they wake up their daughters are still alive! You know what's confusing you?. You see parts of me in yourself and that makes me human. You're fucking nuts. No, I'm not nuts! But you also see yourself in me. The potential we all have. Potential?. Potential is not action. Action is what defines us. You gotta ask yourself one question. You gotta ask yourself if you still wanna find the human behind the monster. Because if you don't, this whole documentary is a waste. Come on. Are you hungry?. Yeah. I haven't had an appetite since I met you. Do you like pepperoni?. Oh, yeah, only the cheese. Coffee?. Thank you! Jennifer. Are you Polish?. No. You?. Yeah, a half. I remember in the holidays when I was a kid we would have huge pots of kebasi and sauerkraut. This place has the best kebasi. No way. No, my mom's butcher, Mr. Tomaszewski hands down the best. Tomaszewski's?. Yeah. Two blocks from my house. Every Tuesday they got these specials and my ma, she's always-- Anyway, they are the best. So. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Beautiful eyes. Huh?. Her eyes. She's got a perfect shade of blue. Puts the sky to shame. My name is Bob and I'm a, uh, an alcoholic addict. I'm coming up on But it ain't easy. And for days now I've just been obsessed, sweating, and, uh, I feel like lm an inch away from going out, but, uh, at least I'm still here. I slipped last night. As many of you know, I've been wrestling with it for days. I still have her blood underneath my fingernails. I was hanging out later than I should. That look in your eyes is slowly pressing the blades into your stomach. My sponsor tells me, Dont beat yourself up about it. Just don't do it today." My name is Arnold. I'm a serial killer. I have one day back. Damn it. I cut off part of Frank's hand. (Mick) Hey. Hey, you see the footage I dropped off? Yeah. Did I tell you? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, the cellar. Mm-hm. Sinatra had such eyes.

And he specifically complemented you on your eyes. Complemented me?. [giggles] He took my picture. Said he'd send me a copy. Ma, Ma, you didn't give this guy our address, did you?. Well, it might be a nice picture. [shouts] Ma, how could you do that?. How could you give a complete stranger our fucking address?. I don't know! Anyway, it's not our address. It's my address. Holy fuck! Youre drinking again, aint you? Thats why you never stay home with me. I smell it. Mothers know. Why don't you go to a meeting?. You'll feel better. I just came from a meeting. You keep all these windows and doors locked. All of them locked! [Police radio transmissions] Hey, I need to see a detective right now. Sign down here.

You say anything and your mother dies. She fucking dies. Is there a problem? Yeah, this fucking cock sucker. Calm down. Use your head, Mick. Is this the way to treat somebody who cares about you?.

He just got out of the hospital a couple of days ago. Is that my problem?. No, it's not. Just let me take him home, please. I'll take him home. We'll give him his meds. If we have to, well take him to the hospital. Im sorry about this. Stay here. Don't move. All right. You must be grateful you got someone looking after you. I hope you don't mind. I thought I'd grab it while I took mom. [whispers] Please. Tell me. Tell me you didn't-- That you, that you didn't kill her. Do you think l killed your mom?. Don't do this to me. How does it feel, Mick, to be a subject?. What do l have to do?. What do you think you have to do?. I don't know. What do you have that I want?. I don't know. What brought us together?. The tape.

I wasn't supposed to-- Fuck you, Gino. He kidnapped my mom. Fuck you. Fuck, fuck you. Fuck you. He's got my mom! Gino what's this?. Come here. Is that a movie?. Uh, it's his documentary. The one before. Before?. Before what?. Before my movie?. I mean, it's, um-- Mickey tells me you're a good editor. (girl) I was up to about four or five bags of heroin a day. He told me I was blue. And I felt-- I felt like l was floating up on the ceiling. Just-- Just looking down on my lifeless body. My soul, I truly believe my soul left my body. You know what? I wasnt even scared. Just looking down on my body all sprawled out. It was sort of beautiful. [Mick grunts] Oh, no, no, no! No, please, please. [cries] T ake it easy. Come on. T ake it easy. [cries] C'mon, we gotta go.

[coughs] [sobbing] No. Nine months sobriety. It's a long time away from someone you love. Do you still feel like using?. No, no, no, no, no. No, I didn't kill these people. Oh, these are miscellaneous. Killing alone. A loner psycho. How much time you waste on that one?. Fuck is this? "Victims. Ruth James, Lynn Matthews, Consuela Roman. Perhaps following the Bible."

You understand me?. I'm finished! [shouts] Stop it! Not anymore! Where did you get this?. Oh, God. In the park. What park?. Which one?. Across the street from where you killed your seventh victim, you sick fuck. Oh, that's brilliant. It's because of all the butts in the cup. You knew I'd spend the night watching her through her window waiting to get in. But how did you know which last drop the receipt came from the bunch?. 'Cause bastards like you usually kill their first victim in their own fucking neighborhood where they're comfortable. So, you went to the last drop nearest to the first victim. That's the one. And then what?. Then I measured the time in the receipt with the time in the surveillance tape. They got surveillance cameras in coffee shops now?. They do when they've been robbed twice. And then you staked the place out for me. You-- You are a genius, Mick. [whispers] Let go off me. You're helping me. I gotta be more careful. I gotta change my patters. (Megan) A happy memory from Jimmys childhood? Well. (Mick) Megan. Can l, uh, can I have one of those? One?. Two. Two. I got this, um-- Three, actually. So, um, where is she now?. Your mother. Dead.

They're filled with his neatly folded screams. (Little Jimmy) Shes calling me again. She says this time [inaudible] I wanted to stay in it. I see the light. Dear God, please, help my Mommy. [jumbled voices] The dirt is inside of me. She says she would leave me forever. The angels live in clouds. I didnt mean to touch it. [jumbled voices and screams] [Little Jimmy crying] [mother shouting] Stop it. Stop it! [Little Jimmy crying and shouting] [mixed voices] He left this note for you. (woman) Who is it? Um, it's, um, Mick Gravatski. Who? Oh, I'm sorry. Um-- Are you the girl, I'm sorry, the wo-- Are you a waitress?. Yeah. What do you want?. Did you serve me the other night at the diner?. Yeah, so?.

Look, your camera is inside. I took it. Fucking charity bullshit. Humanity. You see, power, real power is giving life and taking it away. You, uh, you hug a crippled kid at his birthday party, and then you cut people's eyes out. You put them in baby jars?. Fucking bullshit. Are you coming to my daughter's birthday party in a few days, Mickey?. Carolyn is turning 13. Oh, look at this. Here she is as a baby. Only nine months. Look how pretty she was. Oh, and here is a baptism picture. Theres Jimmy. He was the godfather. Who's the woman?. It's Ma. Your mother?. Jimmy's mother?. Oh. She had an infection. Influenza.

Wheres she buried? Please, Mickey, lm seeing a white light-- [yells] Sit down! Don't you fucking lie to me! Im sorry. Where is she buried? Potter's field.

I just cant remember details. I swear it in my eyes. Be careful where you swear it in. (Jimmy) Shes got a hell of an arm, Mick. What the hell happened?. Oh, nothing. I--I just got upset. What'd you to do her?. I'm just doing my job, Jimmy. [woman] You want 90? These records only go back to 94. Really?. Um, do you think you could run her name for me?.

Do you keep her psychiatric file in this office?. Is there something I could look at? That's inappropriate, Mr-- Still Gravatski. Leave your number if you like. Thanks for your lack of help.

Do you know what lm capable of? People. These people did come. They dont care about nobody. [coughs] You'll let me get rid of her?. The girl. I'll just take care. She was touching your boy, huh?

A cure is inconceivable to them because the crimes are too unforgivable. They simply want people like us dead. But death doesn't end evil. It only sets it free. Are you evil? If I choose to take responsibility for what I've done. Do you? Do you?. [heavy rock music]
