When I hear Mozart, I feel... out of breath. Dizzy... overwhelmed. When I hear Bach... that's more like a good movie for me. What about you? What do you feel when you hear Bach? Oh, shit! Dad! Get out of my fucking... - No! - Mom! Shit! - No! - Mom! Shit! Hey. Guys, settle down. Today we'll be reviewing your tests. And hopefully I can figure out... why the majority of you failed so miserably. - Good work, Sean. - Thank you. Sean. Sean. You got a pen I can borrow? Yeah. What's with that? You don't even have Chemistry. Um, I just like to read, I guess. Hey, Jodie Freedman's having a party at her house tomorrow. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, you should go. - Are you going? - Yeah, I'm going. You should go, man. Get your head out of those books for a while. Yeah, maybe. You judging me? Hot chocolate? Huh? Good morning. Hey, how'd you do on that test? I did okay. Yeah? Uh, what does that mean, okay? I got a hundred. Well, that's great. Better than okay. Listen, Sean, I was thinking of, uh, going up and visiting your mother tonight after work. Um, thought maybe you'd like to come along. I can't. Um... I'm going to this party tonight... with... with my friend. I'm gonna spend the night at his house. If that's... If that's fine. Yeah. That's...That's fine. Uh, who's the friend? Um, this kid Steve. I go to school with him. I don't think you know him. Yea. Well, that's... that's fine. That's, uh... Well, good. Sorry I haven't been up here in a while. Hah. I've been busy. Um, no excuse. Hey, you know I finally got that leak in my room fixed? It was...It was the shingles up on the roof just like I thought. Had to go up there, rip the whole thing out, start all over again. You know how I hate that shit. I never had these problems in the old apartment. Sean says hi. He wanted to come out but he... There's some big party and... I told him to go be a teenager. Yeah. He's doing good. He's doing good. He's got friends now and... All right. I mean, one that I am currently aware of. But, uh... Going off to college next year. Can you believe that? You know, for a while I was really worried about him. But he's going to be okay. He's strong. He's strong like his mother. I wish I was that strong. Do you like your surprise? It's awesome. I have another surprise after this. Thanks so much, Linda. That was amazing. For both of us. It's great to have you. What did you think of the music, Sean? - It was cool. - It was pretty cool, wasn't it? What happened to your face? - I fell. - Yeah, he fell off his bike. You have to be more careful next time, okay? Okay. - Fragile things, kids. - Yes, well, thanks again, Linda. I'll see you at work. Yo, Anna, what's up, man? You got my fucking money or what? No, Tony I got screwed up this week. Kiana had to go to the doctor, and someone broke into the mailbox and took my check. Look at me. Look at me. Are you saying you don't owe me any fucking money? Is that what you're saying, huh? I'm just saying maybe, maybe... Maybe we figure something out. You know? - Hey, Stretch. - Yo. - Hook her up. - Come here, baby. Come on, Kiana. Ben. Hold that down, all right? Just make sure you come correct next time, all right? Thanks so much. If you need anything, you know... Cool. You're good. You're good. - Kiana, come on. - What you looking at, man? Let's go. What, you deaf, nigga? Huh? I'm talking to you, boy. - Yo, T., what's going on, baby? - Yo, yo, yo, yo. Where the fuck you going, man? My man, where you going, baby? What the fuck you doing out here, man? Huh? You lost? You got some money for me? Speak up, motherfucker! Fucking deaf, huh? You hear me talking to you, man? You don't hear 'em talking to you? You killed that... You killed that kid. - What the fuck is he talking about, man? - What did you just say? You killed that little boy. Motherfucker! Fucking deaf motherfucker! Huh? What the fuck, huh? - Fuck, man. - Get the fuck up! Motherfucker! Oh, shit! Look at me, motherfucker! Look at me! Look at me! Yo, Tony. What you doing, man? Stay the fuck back! - Yo, chill. - Stay back! - Yo, put the gun down, man! Relax! - What you gonna do, huh? - Relax, man. - Huh, what you gonna do? You gonna shoot me? - Chill, chill. - Shut the fuck up. - Just chill, man. - You wanna shoot me? - Stay the fuck back! Stay the fuck back! - Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Shit! I know I'm supposed to be there, Richard. I forgot. I'm sorry. I promise I'll pick him up as soon as I get out of work tonight. Okay, I promise! Yeah. Well, tell Lisa if she hadn't slept with my husband behind my back, maybe she wouldn't have all this unfairness to deal with. I'm gonna pick him up. No, I can't just leave. You know everything I have going on with work. No, Richard. No more lawyers. No. Don't even think about doing that. No, you know what it is, Richard? You're a dick! That's what it is. What are you looking at? Detective Ames, can I talk to you a minute? Congratulations on your, uh, promotion. What can I do for you, Larry? I've been feeling really bad how all this went down. Really? Yeah, I do. I was thinking that... when all this is over, maybe... me and you should go somewhere together. Have a little picnic maybe. The three of us. Who? Me, you and your cell mate? I was thinking more like, me, you and your son, Tyler. I hear he looks just like you. I can't wait to meet him. I got bad news for you, Larry. You're not going anywhere for a long time. Do you know where my lawyer is right now? Where? He's sitting with the D.A. This is never going to stick. Never. - You know what's the first thing I'm gonna do when I get out? - What? What are you gonna do? I'm gonna come see you... and that fucking kid. All rise. You may now be seated. On the request of the prosecution, this hearing will be postponed until July 31 of this year. See you all then. You're a crazy kid. You know that, right? Crazy. In his prime... Tyson would've killed Ali. Tyson wouldn't have lasted five rounds. You're crazy. So I did a little reading on you this morning. Impressive career. Anticrime Unit, Narcotics. Let's not forget the Delany case. That was a big one. Now here you are working Homicide. It's an amazing career for a man, but it's spectacular for a woman. And a Latina woman at that. You should be proud of yourself. - What does that mean, Detective? - What? I should be proud because I made it to Homicide? Or I should be proud because I'm a Latina woman who made it to Homicide? Well, first of all, we can drop the detective thing. - It's Gary. - Okay. Gary. I'm just saying that you should be proud for your race. My race? Yeah, your race. - Are you fucking with me? - No. You Latinos. You're a proud people, right? - You Latinos? - Yeah. All right, I suppose you missed the racial sensitivity training. No, I took that. Why? Look, Gary, I don't care if you're a bigot or a racist. I really don't care. It doesn't affect me at all. I just care that you and I get the job done and that you have my back. - Are we clear? - Of course. Good. And I'm not any of those things, so you got nothing to worry about. And I certainly have your back. Oh, and, Gary, if you touch me, I will shoot you. Okay, we're setting up boundaries. That's... I understand that. What? What's up, kid? How was school today? The same. Whoa. What the hell happened to you? Oh. Uh, I got jumped... on the train. Jesus Christ, Sean. - Did you file a report? - No, it happened so fast. I couldn't tell you what they looked like. Your father must be sick about this. Yeah, he is. I really don't want to talk about it, Billy. No problem. Hope you got a couple of shots in at least. Just one. I'm leaving now. I'll be there, Richard. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you work here? No. I don't work here. You look a little young to be a cop, so what are you doing here? Um... Billy, I mean, Detective Baldwin knows I'm here. I'm just, uh, printing... this off and, it's getting late so... I'm sure it's all right. I just... It's my first day here today so I'm just trying to be careful. Yeah, it's no problem. Um, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna go. Ten minutes. I promise. I don't know, Richard. Maybe they don't like police in this town. What? You think I'm doing this on purpose? I think you need a new phone. Yeah. It's pretty bad. The lugs are rusted. I think I'm just gonna call a tow truck. Let me give it a try. All right. Knock yourself out. Well, you're stronger then you look. Is that supposed to be a compliment? No. I'm sorry. I'm just not being used to being the damsel in distress type. - I'm Teresa by the way. - I know who you are. - Really? - Yeah. I've seen you on TV. I know. Larry Childs has made me famous unfortunately. I heard, uh, he's trying to... make a deal or something? Think he'll get off? I don't know. It's out of my hands really. You need any help down there? No, I got it. All right. You're all set. Well, thank you again. - Hey, I still didn't get your name. - Sean. Can I offer you a ride now that you fixed my tire? Oh, no. No, thanks. I take the train. - You sure? - Yeah. Good night. Sean. Sean. Hey, Sean. Whoa! Hey! - Yeah. - Sorry about that, Dad. That's okay. Oh. I thought I was gonna end up with a matching shiner. Let me look at that. Yeah, you're still not upset about the fight, are ya? Hmm? It's nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing to be ashamed of. I had my head handed to me more than a couple times. Can you get that for me? All right. I'm standing here. Damn, you look good. Nice and smooth. Fluid. Chin down. You could be getting more power behind your straight right. You wanna pivot. Pivot on the back foot. Throw your shoulder into it with just a little bit more. Tuck your chin down a little bit. You know, just, just... You know, just... Be nice and fluid on the jab. Pivot. Put your shoulder into it. That's it. These street fighter motherfuckers, they don't give a shit about technique. So don't be afraid to get the most of it, Sean. Well, you get the idea. Yeah, I get the idea. Your birthday's coming up. Yeah, I know. I'm thinking maybe we could do something. I'll call you when supper is ready. Fuck you. He is a little boy! You drunk son of a bitch! - Lower your voice. Lower your... - I will fucking kill you! - Do you understand? - I wanted him go to his room! That's exactly what I mean! Believe it or not, he's gonna fucking listen to me when I tell him to do something! Say that one more fucking time. You touch him again... and I will fucking kill you! Giving me orders now? Is that what you're fucking doing? Who the fuck do you think you are talking to? My fucking house, and I don't like the way you fucking said it! Just shut your fucking mouth! So what do you think? About what? About his story. I think a drug dealer got popped and he's dead. That's what I think. Want anything? No, I'm good. I also think that more than likely that little criminal in there killed him. But of course we're never going to know that because as usual... nobody saw nothin' and we got no murder weapon. So you don't believe anything he said about that other guy? No. What I know... is that a patrol car saw our boy and the victim, working their usual spot the night of the murder. Couple of hours later, Tony's dead. And the next night... junior mafia in there takes over the business. My money's on him. Tony was a pretty serious guy. It's a little ambitious for that kid. He's too young. Did you grow up in a big family, Ames? Yeah, I did. Why? - That explains it. - Explains what? You've got "look at me" syndrome. - What? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, you come from a big family, see, so it's hard for you to get attention. It's hard for Mommy and Daddy to notice you. - Really? - Yeah. So you gotta make a big deal out of everything. - Oh, boy. - No, I mean you gotta over achieve. You have to excel at all costs. - "Look at me" syndrome. - I see. And you've deduced this from what? Me wanting to do my job? Or should I say, wanting to do our job. All I'm saying is... don't make more out of this than it actually is. Look, there are a hundred people out there that wanted Tony dead. He was a true piece of shit, drug-dealing pedophile, I might add. But in the end... killer is usually the first guy that comes to mind. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you. It's great. Homicide 101. I can manage. - I'm just trying to help. - You wanna help me? - Yeah. - Go get me some coffee. That's how you can help me. Only if you come with me. Here. What's his story? Who, Sean? Man. Mother got her head blown off right in front of his face. Like 10 years ago. Car jacking. - That's horrible. - Yeah. He's been coming in here ever since then. Baldwin lets him look at mug shots, see if the guy got grabbed for something else. So he just let's him come in and use the computer unattended? That's not exactly procedure, is it? Bill's senior man on the squad, Ames. I don't ask questions. And he's a little young for you, don't you think, Detective? You're a jerk. No, he helped me change a tire on my car the other day. I just think he's a nice kid, that's all. That's sweet. Look. You, uh... You ready to go? Junior mafia is about to call his lawyer. Yeah, I'll meet you in there in a minute. He's an ugly one. I find them all to be pretty ugly. I wanted to say thank you for the other night. For helping me. Oh. It's, it's not a problem. So now I owe you one. I was thinking maybe I could help you with your work. I'm pretty good at what I do. - Okay. - Ames! - Let's go. - I'll be right there. So it's a deal? I'll take a look at your case, see how I can give you a hand, and we'll talk about it. - You really don't have to do that. You don't want my help? - No, no. - Then don't worry about it. I'll take a look at it, okay? I gotta go. I need a girl. Did you take that vitamin C I gave you? Yes, I did. Thank you. I want you to wear your heavy coat tonight, okay? I don't want this to get any worse then it is. Joe. I don't think... You don't think what? - I'm sick, Joe. - Yeah, I know. That's why I'm trying to do everything I can to make you feel better. I don't want to do this, okay? I'm sorry, but I can't do this tonight. I fucking told you to get up! Get up! I waited and waited for you! I worry about you all fucking day! And all you can do is think about yourself! You selfish fucking bitch! Now you are gonna go that job, and you are gonna like it! Get in the fucking car! Get in the car! Leave her-- Leave her alone. Motherfucker! Joe, don't! You mind your own fucking business! - You picked the wrong fucking guy! - Stop! Please! Sticking your nose into my business. Shut up! Fucker! Ow. Ow! Joe, please don't! Get in the house! Get inside! This is all your fault! Who the fuck do you think you are? You come around here again, and I will put a bullet in your head. And that bitch you tried to save... I am going to beat her until she can't fucking move. So you haven't done anything here except waste my time. Fuck up my car. You didn't save her. You made it worse. Hey, Joe. Did you ever see this man before? I meet a lot of men. It's hard to keep track. Thanks, sweetie. You know what I do, right? - Yeah, you're a hooker. - Gary. Miss Winston, I know what you do. Please, call me Lizzy. Miss Winston is my mother, and I don't want to think about her right now. So you're telling me you didn't recognize him? I never saw this guy before. Anyways, I couldn't really tell what he looked like. He had this black outfit on, and it was kind of dark out. Do you know anybody who didn't particularly like Joey? Maybe someone who wanted him dead? Who didn't want him dead? Lizzy I'm going to have a sketch artist come up here. Look, Miss Detective, Joe was a piece of shit. He was going to kill me. Maybe not last night, but... sooner or later he was going to hit me too hard or choke me. That little girl he killed... Now what are you talking about? Mancini was charged with murdering a 13-year-old girl. - He beat the charge. - Yeah. He used to laugh about that. He was gonna kill me next. That guy... saved my life. He was... sent down by God to save me. You know, I'm getting a second chance now 'cause of him and... You know, you seem like a real nice person, but... I'm not going to help you arrest this guy. Just wouldn't be fair. Teresa Ames. Yeah. The 21. No problem. Okay. - Shit. - What's up? The fucking Delany case has been delayed again. Larry Childs is trying to cut a deal with the D.A. I can't believe this shit. So, what do you care? Fuck 'em. We get paid to catch 'em. After that... it's out of our hands. I gave two years of my life to this case, Gary. I lost my marriage to this case. I lost my fucking son to this case. Who cares? - Are you gonna cry? - Fuck you. No, I mean if you want I'll step out of the car and give you a couple minutes. Women... like to cry. Gary, what the hell do you know about women? Um... Nothing. Thank you. You know, that girl's description match the one in Tony T.'s case? Hey, all that hooker said was that the guy was wearing black. I mean, this is New York. Tell you what, Why don't we go over to the coroner's office. If it's the same gun, then we got something to talk about. Hey, man. You looked good today. You should try out for the tournament. Why? What do you mean, why? To see if you could win. You know, for fun? I don't do this for fun. Look up I.C.W. - Twenty-three and a quarter. - Ah, shit. I'm getting killed. All right. Check out E.R.C.M. - Twelve and three eights. - Ah, shit. All right, Artie, how much longer is this going to take? We got lives to save out there. - A little while longer. - All right. Well, I'm gonna take a piss. I'll be back. He's an ugly one. I find them all to be pretty ugly. Hey, can you look something up for me? Sure, what's the symbol? No, it's not a stock. It's, uh, a word. - Triceleron. - Whoa. Cool. Pretty exotic for a Brooklyn Homicide. - You've heard of it before? - Of course. I've never worked on a case with it, but I know what it is. - What is it? - What is what? The detective was just asking about triceleron. Oh. Cool. Pretty exotic for a Brooklyn Homicide. - Fuck, is that the word of the day? What is it? - It's a poison. Well, some would argue against it being classified as a poison. It's technically an irritant. It poisons the muscular system, Artie. It is thus a poison. It doesn't actually poison anything, Roy. Okay, guys, talk to me, not to each other. What is it? The thing that makes triceleron so interesting... is that it doesn't actually poison the system. And that is what makes it virtually untraceable. It causes a chemical reaction in your esophagus. It swells the muscles and suffocates you in your own body. - You die of asphyxiation. - So it's not the poison that kills you per se. It's your own body that does you in. And all you need it just the slightest taste and it's over. - So it's a poison? - Exactly. It is not a poison. Shell fish, peanuts... These cause the same reaction in some people, and those aren't poisons. If you have a peanut allergy, they are. Cyanide, potassium chloride. These are poisons. - Peanuts are not a poison. - Artie, come on. - Less talking, more digging for that bullet. - You got it. It's a nine-millimeter slug. Same make as your dealer. Ballistics will need a couple of days to get an exact match. Call me when you know for sure. Still think I got "look at me" syndrome? No. Now it's more like you're a pain in my ass syndrome. What do you think of those potatoes? They're fine. Got the recipe from one of those cooking shows. I never thought I'd be watching cooking shows. Just leave me alone. Listen to me. Just leave me alone. - I'm over it already. - I'm sorry. - That's it. Just let it go. What did I tell you? The next time you hit your sister, I'm telling your father! What did I tell you, Richie? Next time you hit your sister, I'm telling your father. In the worst way. Hey. - Just the guy I'm looking for. - Really? Why are you looking for me? I read up on your case. I wanted to talk to you about it. I'm going to lunch if you want to join me. Come on. It's just an egg roll. It's not a date or anything. Come on. Let's go. They're good, I promise. So you get straight A's. You like classical music. Huh. You don't play any sports, and you don't have a girlfriend. A little different for the average high school boy. You have to admit. You ask a lot of questions, you know that? I know. It's my job. I can't help myself. But you're right, so go ahead. Ask me a question. How long were you married for? How do you know I was married? I... I read an article in the paper. It said you were married. Okay, so how do you know I'm divorced? Well, for starters, you're not wearing a ring. What if it gets in the way of my work? Nah, you're not married anymore. I can tell. And how can you tell, Detective Donovan? Tell me. There's a sadness in your eyes. Like you lost someone. If you see sadness, it's not for my ex-husband. Believe me. It would be more for my son. Yeah. Richard, he had, um... He had better lawyers and... a lot more money. I was working all the time, so I guess in the end it really was my fault. I have... weekends and every other Wednesday. What's your son's name? Tyler. Tyler. I'm sure Tyler loves you very much. Let's go. I told you, no vegetables. So why do I find vegetables in my lo mein when I get home? You say vegetables in lo mein, you get vegetables in lo mein. - Vegetables in lo mein. - No, no, no. Bitch. No fucking vegetables. - Fuck you, black bastard. - No, no. Fuck you, you fucking Chinese... - All right, all right. That's enough! - Get the fuck off me. Okay, can I just get two egg rolls, please? Sir. Two egg rolls? Get this pushy bitch two eggrolls. Ugly bitch! Choke on them. You should watch your mouth. I have a good mind to come back here later, and put a bullet in your head, and your ugly wife too. Come on. What the fuck? You speak Chinese? Yeah. My mom always wanted me to... master a second language. She said if you learn one, it's easier to learn... three or four. So I decided... why not learn the hardest language and go from there. Wow. Okay. So if you ever get around to speaking Spanish, let me know. Maybe I can help you. Oh, there we go. He speaks Spanish. A little bit. I'm really sorry about what happened to your mom. I looked at the file and, um, to be honest with you, there's really not a whole lot to work with. It just looks like a random carjacking. Yeah, that's what I've been told. I find it really inspiring that you're still looking into that. It could take years before this guy turns up. And even then, there are still no guarantees. So are you telling me that I should just give it up? Is that why you brought me here? I'm saying that it's been nine years. And if it was me and... I was your mother, I would want you to get on with your life. What do you know about my life, Teresa? I'm just trying to help you. What if I told you I found the killer? What? Are you saying you found him? No, no. I'm saying, what if I did? Well, we would... bring him in and charge him. But there's no murder weapon. There's no proof. Just my word. Sean, this is going to be really hard for you to hear because it's your mother, but the truth is that that's the way it has to be. It's called due process, and there's no way around that. Due process. This was my mother, Detective. She taught little kids music. It's not like she died in a car accident... or died of cancer. She was murdered. Murdered trying to protect me. Somebody... made the decision... to end her life. The piece of shit walks around every day. Going through it... like it never happened. Due process. How'd due process work out for you in the Child's case Teresa? Scumbag kills two fucking people and now they're talking about... tainted evidence and the Witness Protection Program? That's your due process? How did due process work out for you in your divorce case? Think you were treated fairly? You can keep your due process. Thanks for the egg roll. What are you doing with triceleron? What? What are you doing spying on me? It's a poison. It's illegal. Do you know that? Yeah, I know. I wrote a paper on the history of poisons in my Chemistry class. Got an A. We done with the questions now? Yeah, we're done. Last one. Mmm. Why did you make me do that? Why not? As I was saying, Tony and Joe... both come from the same fucking neighborhood. And both of them were scumbags. Somewhere... both of them fucked over the same guy, and they both end up getting wacked. I mean it really could be just as simple as that. - Okay. It's the last one. - Last one. - Oh, please let it be the last one. - Hoo. Did you know that Tony... beat his girlfriend's son to death? A seven-year-old boy. Did you know that? About five years ago. Yes, I did know that. And he beat the rap. That's what our victims both have in common. - They both killed somebody and got away with it. - Oh, come on. - What? - Come on. We're back to revenge killings? Vigilante shit. Maybe. Can I ask you a question? - What? - Are you telling me everything? What do you mean? Well, I mean we're partners right? Yes, that's-- Yes. Is there something about these murders that you're keeping to yourself? - Of course not. - Good. Because I don't mind saying, you have a reputation... for being out there for yourself. I mean, you do know that, right? - Really? - Oh, yeah. Mmm. Your partner's name didn't even make it into the paper on the Delaney case. Your partner. Why is that, I wonder? Why is his name not visible? - 'Cause he's still... He's still in Anticrime Unit. - That's politics. You know that. There was no promotion there. No promotion whatsoever. You should know better than that. It's fucked up that you're asking me this. Are you done insulting me? - For the time being... - Good. - I am done insulting you. However, I am also drunk, and I'll probably be insulting you later on. Okay, good. I'm gonna go and pay my respects. I will... pay the bill. Detective Baldwin? Hi, I'm Teresa Ames. - We haven't had the chance to meet yet. - Oh, yes. Wonder Woman from the Bronx. My pleasure. - Are you enjoying your party? - Is this party for me? I thought it was for you. Why would it be my party? I don't... This is the "Welcome to the Squad" party for Teresa Ames. Or couldn't you tell? Out with the old. In with the new. Yeah. Well, we'll pick this up later. - I'll let you be with your friends. - No. Now is perfect. What did you want to talk about? The skinny white kid? Is that it? Sean? Don't be so shy, Detective. You're his favorite topic. And now you're in the same station with him. Who would have guessed that? I'm not following you. What do you mean? See if you can follow this. Leave him alone. I'll be gone Friday. I'll be golfing. He won't have anyone else to help him out. The kid has... issues. - Get it? - Yeah, I do get it. I read the file. You read the file! So... you must know everything now. Let me give you a little update, Detective. You don't know shit. Leave him alone. And let him get back to his life. When I leave, he'll leave. He doesn't need you fucking up his head any more than it already is. Enjoy your party. I don't know. He just flipped out on me. He's just drunk. You taking the train? Of course I'm taking the train. I'm hammered. - Wake up. - I'm awake. You're snoring. I am not snoring. The dinner was nice. Friday and then Saturday, couple of the guys came over to the house early. Please. Men, uh... They fighting. Please go. Please. Filthy. Filthy. Fucking dog. Whoo! Huh, pussy, where you going? They fuck like a bunch of dogs. They make filthy fucking children. That's right. Animals like a pig. Like a fucking pig. What are you looking at? What are you looking at, family? Huh? You think you're better than me? Ha! You think you're better than me? You think you're better than me? Huh? Huh? That's what you think? Please. Leave me alone. Please? You want me to please you? Is that what you want? - No! - You want me to please you? - Is that what you want? - Hey, why don't you leave her alone? Why don't you sit the fuck down, pig! Huh? You wanna die early?

You want me to please you? Is that what you want? I'll please you. Huh? Is that what you want? I know that's what you want. That's what it sounds like. I can hear you. I can smell you. I can smell what you want. I'm gonna show you what you want. Sit the fuck down, pig! You wanna die? Please, uh... They fighting. Please go. Okay. Okay. I quit. All right. Stop. I quit. Hey! Hey! Fuck. Where the hell were you? I was at a... I was at a party. Shut up! You wanna explain this? Testosterone Cypionate. Steroids? What the fuck are you doing looking through my shit? Look motherfucker, you live in my house! This shit's in my house! I ask the fucking questions. You shut the fuck up! - I will put your head right through that window. - Fucking try me, you asshole! You go to the gym. You fucking do push-ups. You fucking pussy. You don't take this shit. You don't take shortcuts. What's the matter with you? Tell me that I raised you better than that. Yeah, you fucking raised me real good. What do we have? This little boy got a good look at him before he put that stuff on his face. Get this. Before this wacko gets up and pummels the homeless guy, he tells the kid to take his mother and leave the car. I guess he didn't want the kid to see what was going to happen. I thought they didn't speak English. They don't. This guy spoke Chinese. Get up. Get up, Sean. Sean? Sean. Get up. Get up. a way to spend your birthday. So get up, get dressed. We got a schedule to keep. What are you talking about? It's a surprise. Get up. See you downstairs. - So where are we going? - Where are we going? It's your birthday. So the first thing I'm getting you is a cake. All right? This is the best damn cake in New York. It is pretty good. You know, your mother and I used to come here before you were born. Doesn't look like much, but the food... it was pretty mediocre. This is also where, you know, I would hang out with my friends, and we'd have a... like, I don't know, like a meeting of the minds. God, I don't recognize it anymore. Yeah. I guess it's been a long time. Not long enough. Erin. Jesus. Jesus. - How you been? - How you doing, Rock? Good. I'm great. Erin, this is my son, Sean. My God. I remember when Mary was pregnant with this little devil. - Now look at him. Handsome like his old man. - Get out of here. Listen. It's been a long time. How you been? Doing okay. I own this dump now. - No. - Yep. Bought it from Tina years ago. Congratulations. That's, that's great. So where have you been, Rock? I mean, it's gotta be, what, I heard you moved out to Marine Park? Yeah. Yeah. No, I did. I, uh... I got a nice house, in a nice neighborhood. Good for you, Terry. Finally got yourself out of this place. - I'm proud of you. - Nah, it wasn't so bad. - Ah, well, it's pretty bad. - Yeah, it's pretty bad. Listen. Why don't you sit down and keep Sean company. - I'm gonna hit the head. - Okay. - Oh, Terry? - Yeah. Take a look on the back wall there. - I got some old pictures of you and the guys. - Okay. - Hi. - Sean, right? God, your old man, he looks great. He looks better now than he did when he used to hang around here. He looks younger. Yeah, that's 'cause he stopped drinking. Yeah. Well, that'll do it. So, you called my dad Rock. Is that a nickname or... Yeah, Rocky. You know, like the fighter, the boxer? From the movie? Anyway, I mean your dad wasn't a heavyweight. He was more of a scrapper. You know? Really a great boxer. He could have gone pro. If it hadn't been for the booze. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Your old man, he did a lot more fighting in the street than he did in the gym, If you know what I mean. But, uh, with those animals he used to hang out with, I guess that was just par for the course. Rock. That's, that's funny. Oh, hey. I was telling your son here what an upstanding citizen you were back in the day. Uh, yeah. Listen, um... - God, Erin, I hate to run out like this on you but... - No, no, no. Come on. - I insist. I insist. - What's up? Um... - Come on. We gotta go. - What's the hurry? Come on. We gotta go. It's a surprise. - I'm gonna stay in touch. - You better. - Don't wait 10 years. - I won't. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you too, Sean. See you around. Sorry to rush you out of there like that, but we don't wanna miss the first fight, do ya? What fight? What are you talking about? Well, get in the car and I'll show ya. This kid in the red is pretty good. - Yeah, that's Angel. - I spar with him all the time. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, he looks pretty tough. He's not that tough. - Really? - Yeah. He looks pretty tough to me. Oh! Man, I forgot they had fights at my gym tonight. Your gym? My gym first. Great fights. - Yeah, they were pretty good. - Yeah. Hey, listen, one more stop. Then we'll head back home. - Okay? - Okay. - All right. Why did you bring me here? Well, I wanted you to remember this. You think I forgot about this? No. No, I know you haven't. I know this memory is... still fresh in your mind. I see it in your eyes every day. What I wanted you to remember, Sean, is that your mother died that night. Your mother died here. She did. Not you. You have a life to lead. A long life. I... I... I think it's time you start living it. I know we haven't been the best of friends. I know. You don't think I know, but I know what a piece of shit I was back then. I do. And I can't explain to you how sorry I am for the things that I did to you. And to your mother. And I'll never forgive myself for the person that I was. But I gotta start living my life. I... But I... I need my son back to do that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - That's the last of it. - No golf today? Detective Ames, what's going on? If I was retired, I'd be playing golf. What are you doing here, Detective? I wanna finish our conversation from the other night. I was a little drunk that night. I might have been a little out of line. No. You were a lot out of line. Well, you're out of line coming to my house uninvited. I need some answers about Sean. Leave him alone. That's your answer. I can't do that anymore. Let's have a drink. I was 10 years on the squad... when they brought that kid into the station. They should have brought him to the hospital. He was in shock. No emotion. No crying. He'd just stare. Those eyes looking right through you. I wanted him to have a look at the mugs... while the perp's face was still on his mind. Him and his father. His father saw this guy up close. He pistol-whipped him outside the car. Sean was all for it. Sat there for three hours straight. Sure enough... picks this guy out just like that. But when we showed the photo to his father, he says, "No. That's the wrong guy." The kid looks at his father like he's crazy. Sean knows this is the guy. Mr. Donovan pulls Sean to the side. Gives him a lecture about the consequences of his action. The first time he'd dealt with consequences. Sean takes another look at the photo. Says he made a mistake. His father's right. It's not the guy. I felt bad for the kid. He's about my son's age. You know, he never talked about his mother. Never. Never talked about that night. I remember that con's name though. I didn't even know it was still in my head till about six months ago... when I saw his picture in the paper. Seemed some hotshot detective... arrested him for the murder of Angela Delany. Jesus Christ. Larry Childs. Yeah. Larry Childs. Do you think he killed his mother? I don't know. He was a career criminal before you busted him. All I know is, when that article came out, something snapped in that kid. He was different after that. He was convinced... Childs killed his mother. Sad thing is, I know his father must have seen that article too. Can you imagine having your son look at you every day... thinking you betrayed him? Can you imagine that? - This yours? - Yeah. There you go. How's it going? - Is that your mom? - Oh, yeah. Yeah? He's pretty cute. What are you doing here, Sean? - Hey, you like cake? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. You should really think about taking him to Tina's in Bushwick. Best cake in New York. Give the ball back. Come on. We gotta go. You know, you really shouldn't be here, Sean. I wanted to talk to you about something. I-I got your address from the station, and, um, I looked it up, and there was only two parks in your area. And I figured this one's better suited for kids, so I thought I'd probably find you here. Every other Wednesday, right? - Is that his father? - Come on. We'll talk about it tomorrow, Sean. Let's go. There he is. How was your day with your mom? Good. Hey. Hey. Everything okay? Richard, please, just give me one second. Please. - Sean, you gotta leave right now. - I am leaving. I just wanted to thank you. I'm giving it all up. Like you said. I'm moving on with my life. You should move on with yours. No. This isn't over, Sean. It is for me. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Bye, baby. I love you. - You ready? - Yeah. Hey, Rock. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? I don't know. Honestly. Going crazy maybe. Why? What's up? Uh, you see the news? No, why? Childs cut a deal. It's official. He must have had dirt on someone. What was his sentence? Two years. And then he's in the Witness Protection. - Two years. - Yeah. Just thought you'd want to know. Okay. - Thank you. - I'm sorry, Teresa. Two years. Mind getting me one? Thanks. I can never get my arm down far enough. I'm sorry. I don't... I don't even know your name. I see you at school, but you know how it is. Sean. Sean Donovan. I'm Amanda Richards. How come I've never seen you around these things before? Uh, been pretty busy. Hitting the books a lot. Looks like they've been hitting back. That's a serious boo-boo you got right there. - What happened? - Oh, um, I fell. - You fell? - Yeah, off my bike. You fell off your bike? Are you lying to me, Sean Donovan? Well, if you must know, I, uh, got into a fight with a pimp... and he caught me in the arm with a baseball bat. It looks worse than it is. You're weird. - Hey, there's my girl. - I'm not your girl, Bruce. You're not cheating on me, are you? - Bruce, will you take a walk? - Hey, you go to my school. - What's up, punk? - Bruce, will you please just leave? I just want to talk to you for a second. What, you can't talk to me now? - Fine. Give me a minute. - Don't make me wait. I'm sorry about that. He seems like a nice guy. He's not that bad. Just a jerk sometimes. Listen, I've got to go, but I'll see you later, okay? - Don't leave. - I won't. Hey, man. Uh, I got your... This is yours. What is this? - This isn't mine, man. - Yeah, it is. No. Sorry, dude. You got the wrong guy. You could say thank you. Yo, man, what are you doing talking to freshmen? Let's sit down. Hey, Rock. They called my Dad Rock. Hey, Rock. Hey Rock. Hey Rock. Hey, Rock. Hey, Rock. Get out of the... Time's up, Rock. - Bitch! - Don't you ever touch me! Calm down! Calm down. You like to hurt people? What, you got a death wish, jerk-off? Sean. You like hurting people, right? - I'm gonna hurt you, you stupid prick. - I don't think so. What are you, crazy? What the hell just happened? - Give me your keys. - I can't give you my keys, man. I gotta get home. Give me your fucking keys! Hey, Rock. Shut up! Terry, stop screaming and get us out of here. - Mom, are we lost? - Yes, honey. We're lost. We're not lost. - The guy just hit our car. - Wait, Terry. Will you stop giving me shit? What's going on, Mom? Your dad's just getting information so we can get the car fixed. Time's up, Rock. Fuck off, man. Oh, my God. Shit! Sean, get out of the car! Get out of the... No! Sean! Mom! Yeah, there's a break-in at my house. Sean. Sean. Oh, my God. Sean? Hey, Dad. Sean, what are you doing? I... Are you drunk? Yep. Just like you, Dad. Remember when you were drunk all the time? Remember those days, Dad? 'Cause I do. I remember this one time... with the belt. And you were going in on me real good! But Mom got in the way, and you didn't like that, did you, Dad? So it was Mom's turn. But she was a lot bigger than me. So you could really put your shoulder into it. Right, Dad! I... I remember... standing there... Watched you beat her! And I... And I just stood there, and I did nothing! Because I was afraid that you would start hitting me again! I was a coward then. But I'm not a coward anymore. - Whoa! Whoa! Put the gun down! - For fucking money? - Get that gun outta my face. - Piece of shit! For fucking money? - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about! Don't treat me like a kid. I'm not stupid. You understand? I'm not fucking stupid. I'm talking about Larry Childs. What? Yeah, your old pal Larry. How much money did you get for her? How much was she worth? You motherfucker. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Now put the fucking gun... - I do know what I'm talking about! Yes, I do. You collected money on her life insurance. What? That's how we got out of that shit neighborhood! Yeah. Sean, you better get that fucking gun out of my face. - And I mean now. - Stay the fuck back. - Get that fucking gun out of my face. - Stay the fuck back! Goddamn it! You think I killed my wife? Your mother? Is that what you think? I know you did. I know you did! You don't know shit. Larry Childs. Okay. So, yeah, I knew Larry Childs. You must have seen him. But you didn't recognize him from that night, Sean. I heard him call you Rock. Your nickname Rock! Sean! You're wrong. Okay? You made a mistake then, and you're making one now. Now, what is more likely, that I had your mother killed, my wife, for that life insurance money, or that I didn't get you the help you needed when you needed it? What kind of man do you think I am? Okay. I'm sorry. Sorry. Don't be. Don't be sorry. It'll be okay. I'm sorry I can't believe you. He killed her. Hired that animal to kill her. Where's your father, Sean? Somebody broke in. I found him in the basement. He's dead. You said you wanted to help me, Teresa. My name is Sean Donovan. When I was nine years, a woman was murdered in front of my eyes. Her name was Mary Donovan. She was my mother. My life changed that night. It changed how I see the world. I tell you this because I think that night changed your life as well. I know the suffering you must go through every day, hearing the cries of your victims in your head, seeing my mother's face in your dreams, praying that one day the pain will stop. That is why I write you today. To help you ease your pain. To let you know that I forgive you for what you did. I ask only this, that you help ease my pain. Let me know if my father was a part of this murder. Let me clear my conscience... and let my mother rest in peace. All I want is the truth. The truth, and I will stay quiet for the rest of my life. I've provided you with a safe way to answer me. I've included a return envelope and two stamps. Place the black stamp on the envelope if my father is guilty, the red stamp if he's not. Childs. I implore you to help me in this matter, as it would be hard for me to continue forgiving you if you do not. I wish you well, Mr. Childs. Sincerely, Sean Donovan.
