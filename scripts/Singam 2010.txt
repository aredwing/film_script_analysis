I can stop it. -you can't do it. -I can. tell him about me. If my marriage is stopped, your marriage too will be stopped. What if the bride stops the marriage.. ..when you are the bride?

Do they brew liqour only in the villages? Are the villages so mean? If one wants to prepare the liqour he will prepare it anywhere. We ceased those cans only from the city. Or, did it you who prepared the liqour and ceased those cans? Do you know with whom are you speaking? I know! you're asking me to reIease the accused even before I arrested them. Are you an Asst. Commissioner? We have to arrest the culprits and punish them. We don't need any power and posting for that.

They have offered the same uniform to us. UsuaIIy the police men have the Iions embIem on their cap and the batch.. But I have it on my chest. you are a AC. So they offered you an air conditioned room. But I am not a AC.. So I am working in a room not air conditioned.

If I have Rs.5,000, I'll start a vegetabIe shop If I have Rs.50,000, I'll start a provision shop If I have 5 lakhs, I'll start a departmentaI store No need to borrow money from others.. ..and no need to work as a sIave. Get out. This is one of the police stations which is in my control. It could be one of the police stations in your control. But this is the one and only police station which is in my control. If anybody comes and disturb my work I won't spare them. Where is Mayil vahanam? What are you seeing? you didn't expect me, did you? you didn't expect me that I would face you with courage, did you? you didn't think that I would hit you aIone, did you?

Have you seen it whiIe hunting ferociousIy? When it hits, it will reIease one and haIf ton weight Want to see? See it. This is the hand worked in fieId work to provision stores job I don't obey to anyone or borrow anything so easily Everyone would have seen 3 Iion embIems in a police cap There is a 4th Iion embIem in the backside No one would've seen that If you like to see it, you won't be alive I am in Ambattur.

I'm sIowIy meIting away.. ..with your love my dear! My desires are very small. There are new poems! You make look those in miIIions. You made me to drench with a drizzIe. You turned into a storm and uprooted me. I am opening my heart! I take you in it. I forget myseIf totaIIy with your love for me. I enjoy the thoughts about you. I enjoy myseIf because of that. I am floating aIone in the deeds you do. You made me to sustain, not knowing your love. I was arrogant.. ..and she has done to me which I don't know. Did you see my father? He is very sincere man. He showed the Iicense and came. your dad needn't have shown that damn Iicense. -Why? -It had expired 3 months ago. Who? Who is on the line? -Hey, what happened? -Is it that Inspector? Did he ask at what time you will start? Did he ask the route and where you stop? tell me. He asked you to come to the RTO office at 10 o' cIock. -He asked you to bring the Iicense and 3 passport size photos. -For what? your Iicense has expired before 3 months. If you are driving with an expired Iicense.. ..he told that you will get 6 months jail term & Rs.5,000 fine.

It seems it is this house. Stop here. Erimalai! Come. Why did you come suddenIy? That SI has suspended me for 2 months. Hence I won't go to that village. Give me some post here. I will be with you.

Over sir. How is it? -How can I catch it? -Shut up! How can a voIcano be patient? -Hey, stop the Iorry. -Greetings! I got a information that smuggIed goods are in your Iorry. That's why I am suspecting you. -I don't do that in my Iorry. -I want to check you. Ok, do it. There is nothing in this Iorry. I thought so. This new SI has disgraced us by giving wrong information. We shouldn't have suspected the singh who is famous for hard work. -It's ok. -you start the Iorry. -It's ok. will you take my moped in your Iorry and fill petrol in it? Ok, I will fill the petrol in your bike. -Ok. -Long live! Long live! An old Iady prepared vadai(snacks) to seII. A crow took it and flew off. -Long live! -Where is that Iorry? There are no smuggIed goods in that Iorry. -We have checked compIeteIy. -He has smuggIed that Iorry. -Start the vehicle. -Ok sir.

He is my lover. you said that he is a villager. But he is smart. Welcome. They are my friends. He is Durai Singam. -Greetings! -Hai.. you told me to wear black & blue. But all are wearing the same coIor dress. -This is our dress code. -Please, order something.. If we have a get together we will enjoy wearing the same dress -Kavya, what is this? -This is my gift. See, what has written in this? It's you only. He is coming in Benz car. Did you say the programme at the last minute? -No, why? -Then, why have you all come with loose hair? We are always like this. Oh! Is this loose hair? In my village we call this as sloppy! No, you cover your pretty face with hair and call it as loose hair. This has nicer look. I have come. Kavya, you.. I've brought what you wanted. Durai Singam is upstairs in the restaurant. -What are you saying? -Ok! Quick! follow that Benz car. Has Durai Singam come? -tell him to kidnap the girl. -Brother! Durai is involved this matter. I will face him. I'll show my power. -Leave me. -Don't shout! Start the vehicle. you cycIe shop keeper! Do you think this as tire business? I said to bring the money box. But you brought the police. police! BeIieve me. I didn't bring any police. you asked for 4.5 lakh rupees. That is my one week's income. I can give you Rs.4 crores if asked. -But don't harm my daughter. -Hey, be on the line. It seems nothing has happened after hearing his words. Our guys kidnapped your daughter due to a small confusion. I said I'll give the money. Don't get tense. Nothing will happen to your daughter. Listen! you go to hoteI BIue 'D' in ECR road at 2'o cIock. -tell me. Give the money and take your daughter. -My daughter is important to me. -Nothing will happen. Wait a minute. Brother, is anybody there? -Nobody is here. -you keep watching him. First you leave the phone there. And start from there. -Put your phone down. -What do you mean? -He has put the phone down. -Go and take the phone. -Ok brother. See, check his recent out calls! -He didn't call for an hour. -Ok brother. He has come causaIIy. But you've made me tense. Had he come, I would have shown my power. -Over take and go -We will catch him. -Quick. Where are you going? I am going home from the office. your house is not in this area. Am I lying then? I need not have to lie to you. you are doing something wrong. I am following you after seeing your activities in city square. I have a place in this society. Why is it necessary to ask questions stopping my vehicle? -Dad, what happened? -Sir, you are doing something wrong. -I want to know that. -EIse I'll inquire you after taking you to the station. I said I haven't done any mistake. -What is it... again and again? -your dad is doing something wrong. I asked him. But he is hiding it. Sir, tell me. -Dad..! -What is in the dickey? -Sir, dickey.. you are doing some illegal business. your face tells that. -Why are you suspecting me? -Give some respect to him. Why are you talking like this? If you speak like this I won't keep quiet. Ask your dad to open the dickey. -There is nothing in the dickey -tell him to open it. It could be some drugs or he might have killed someone and kept inside. will you tell me or shall I take you to the station and inquire? -Give respect to him -will you tell me or not? I will tell you. They've kidnapped my second daughter. -Dad! -I am roaming for 2 hours like a mad guy. I think they kidnapped for the money as you said. Nothing will happen to Divya. No problem, we have money. -I will take care. go. -It's ok. I don't want police heIp. -My daughter is important to me. -Sir, nothing will happen to your daughter. I will take action after you get your daughter safely. you go. Someone will be watching us. Sit. Kavya, give your phone. No one should know that you have the phone. Kavya, you go home. Keep the mobile in seat and talk to me. No one has got down from it. May be this vehicle. Sir, this is MahaIingam's vehicle. Nothing shouldn't happen to my daughter. Take courage. Take the bag. I took the bag. Start the vehicle. -Auto is going. -Money is not important. Accused is important. Hey..! Go. -shall I go? -Wait, let the girl get into the vehicle. -Dad! -Wait..! -Dad! -Go! Run! Lie down! They used the stoIen mobile. I've brought the owner of the phone. Where've you missed your mobile? Last evening I lost it in the hoteI when I had the food. Why didn't you deactivate it? I called to my phone. Someone has taken my mobile. I said I am in MyIapore. He said that he is in Mangadu.. ..and told that he will give it in the evening on the way to Nungambakkam -That's why I didn't give the complaint. -you may go. A boy got lost in Anna nagar before 11/2 years. In that case.. ..we got a cell phone as the cIue. When we inquired him he said he was in Thiruvotriyur.. ..he said that he was coming to Mount road from Thiruvanmiyur.. ..he will give the phone on the way. It seems there is a connection between those two. Welcome sir. Why are you coming at this time? Brother, think well. I heard the word through you that 'Adyar to Ambattur.' you are in Adyar. But you are saying that you are in Ambattur. That day we went to Mayil vahanam's house. In that place Sekar was speaking in the phone. all of you go out. all of you come out. you fooI! Why don't you say that you are Mayil vahanam's man? I too am his man. Had you told that I wouldn't have shot you. Brother is scoIding me. I don't know that you are his man. I didn't see you with him. I am from Gummidipoondi. I come often and kill the guys and get the coIIection for him. Sir, who is Mayil vahanam? I don't know anyone. -I am telling nonsense in dizziness after having the tabIet. -It's ok. you take care of your health. Mayil vahanam has only kidnapped the girl. He is doing the mistake. DefiniteIy he would've kidnapped many persons. OfficiaIIy there is no complaint against him. First we should get complaints against him from victims. How sir? -Sir, is this true that what you are telling? -When did it happen? Those two people have confessed they kidnapped 15 people. They've collected 45 to 50 lakh rupees per person as ransom If they have given the complaint.. ..we will get back the money. They won't tell the truth even if they're tortured. This is a game of Durai Singam. He became a torture. Media & Press have made us a sick department If the CM & home minister ask what should we answer? I did a strategy to find out how many people are affected by this. Sir, we have expected 15 people. But 40 people have come. -Someone kidnapped my son. -How can you say like this? How many people are connected in this? -Sir, get back our money. -Look there. Arrogant people and those who gave black money have not come. Who is Durai Singam? C.RAMANATHAN, InternaI Affairs Minister. He is a new officer, but he gives interview as he Iikes. I want to see him. -Why should you see him? -I want to see him. Sir! Where were you these days? I was searching for a man like you. HaiIing from a small village, you've done it well. you beat him whoever is involved in this kidnap. Whoever it is, you arrest them. I will be with you. I promote you as the Officer of Anti-kidnapping force. I promote you as Assistant Commissioner. Get the order ready. He is the Sun caressing the sky. He is the wind crossing all barriers. He is the Fire that sets ablaze the forest. He is the scorching water! Even the earth salutes to his gait! He is coming with an arrest warrant it seems. you got scared when you saw the paper that it is arrest warrant. This is my promotion order. you asked me what could I do when you are only an Inspector? Now I am Assistant Commissioner of police. That day one magazine 12 bullets. Today 3 magazine and 36 bullets. I thought you are doing rowdyism, settling disputes.. ..and you threaten the builders in OMR road. Hurting the minds of their parents.. ..you are earning by kidnapping their children. will you come good? Not 40, I have kidnapped 55 children. Who will come to say witness? Do whatever you can. Go. I will go. I will destroy your whole network and windup your rowdyism in OMR road.. ..and finaIIy I'll make you fIee this city or even Tamil Nadu. you can decide yourseIf whether I've to arrest you or kill you in encounter. Forces of nature rest in him. The inspector whom you recommended to transfer to Thiruvanmiyur.. I've promoted him as Assistant Commissioner. you said that he is your reIative. In what way? He is my agnate. Thugs would be making a heII of the place. The police department would aptIy assign Singam to take control. Is this called courage? Is this dare deviIry? Is he the sign of bravery? We can't tell anything when investigation is going on. He is the saviour to any crisis His own ways cause eternaI fear to criminals No building promoter need to get scared over Mayil vahanam and his guys.. ..those who construct the buildings. you shouldn't give the money to them. If he comes again I'll deal with him. Singam.. He is Durai Singam! His arrivaI creates rippIes 'Chain' Bhaskar, 'Attack' Pandi, 'Thundu' Rajendran, 'Nattu' Nahendran, 'Speed' Ravi, 'BeII' Kumar. -What you do? -I am an auto driver. What is the connection between auto driver and the nick name? I know that you are henchman of Mayil vahanam. In future, you don't do work for him. I am waiting for shooting order. If I see nick name in the notice or posters before your name.. ..every year we will print the condoIence. Be careful. Why do you sound duII? Sorry or thanks? I spoke without understanding you. Sorry. Thanks to you for taking the risk and saving my family. To be fair I should thank you. That day you motivated me that's why I got speciaI officer post. HeadIines in paper and news channeIs. Everything. people say husband has to Iisten the wife's words. Wife? -Hey, come on. -He is in this restaurant. -Ok brother. Some people are sitting behind us, isn't it? yes, why are they sitting here? I think they are going to kill us. Hide your fear and keep a smiIing face. Dear, I am scared. How can you face them? I don't know. Hey, catch her. Go. Go madam. -Is your restaurant insured? -yes, we have. What? There was a restaurant here. What happened? Just know they vacated the place. Where should I pay the biII? Those who had food paid your biII too. you need not pay the biII. Kathipara Kaja has settled in our area that who was doing vioIence in Mumbai. How can I endure this? He has left the old activities and come back as a good man. He could have come with some plan. We have to arrest him. I will provoke him. When he raises his hand to hit me.. ..you take a snap in your mobile. That is the evidence. Greetings! CaIm down. God is love. SiIence. Patience is great! I think he doesn't like playing carom. We will play some other game. Come. Lime! He doesn't like lime too. We will play with egg plant. Erimalai, this is not egg plant. This is egg plant bomb. I brought the pistoI and bomb when I came to Tamil Nadu from Mumbai. -Then? -But you've provoked me. If you move your leg it will expIode! God is love. Come. Why is he saying like this? Wait, I will investigate and tell you. It is a dummy bomb. He has made you a fooI. Come sir we will go the station. Down with the damn egg plant! How can I endure this? -Come Durai Singam! -Mom, when did you come? -UncIe has come. -How are you uncIe? -How are you dear? I am fine mom. -How did you find the address? -Erimalai told it. Where is dad? We know only about your promotion. But I only know the real problem in that. If you don't like get the transfer and come to our village. What are you saying? Do you want me to return home fearing these rowdies? Tuticorin sweet is deIicious Why have all of you come? How did you come here? He said that you will come. That's why I have come to meet you. Who told you that we have come here? That is.. your son only told me. He doesn't know that we are coming here. I only asked you to come to Chennai. I said only casuaIIy. But I didn't call whole heartedIy. I feel very happy. Whatever happens, you must be the winner. till then you need not come even to the village for the temple festivaI. Mom, I have some work in Commissioners' office. After I finish this.. When did she come? Mom, see you. Sister see you. Wait, she is sitting here. Why don't you go without seeing her? I have seen her somewhere. -She is our village Chinna Durai grandpa's grand daughter. Isn't it? -yes. Why has she come home? She has faiIed 3rd standard. She has come to inform that. Come for a minute. I think what I expected will happen. She told that you only asked her to come. But you told that you don't know her. I am caught between you both. Who will beIieve your parents? Come to the station. I will show you how to beat. I am talking about beIieving and he is telling about beating. will he beat me? -Did you bring all the files? -yes sir. One minute. Madam has come. Why did you bring them now here? I went to his home. They suddenIy decided to come here. I didn't know how to avoid them Everything will happen only after dad's acceptance. Ask him to come inside. you tell him. Why did he come here? will I accept this proposaI if he comes with his family? -Ask why are they here? -What? -call them. -Go. Come MahaIingam. -Are you fine? -Come. -Sit down. I came in the morning from the village. Thank God! She came home. We came with her in your car. I feel very sad for what happened that day in the temple. you come to the village rareIy. He got angry with you. I am just a grocer. I spoke to you furiousIy. -Take it. -Ok. -Now only I am at ease after seeing you. Are you Iooking out for proposaIs for your eIder daughter? you will get rich grooms for your status. It is not enough if he is smart and from a good family. you must see if he has any bad habits too. Because we see daiIy in Tv and newspapers how the rich people are behaving. See you. I am also Iooking out for proposaIs for my son. If you know a girl from a family of my status like grocer.. ..shop keeper or like.. Then let me know. -See you madam. -See you. -Manikkam! -Madam! -Drop them at home. -Ok madam. -Doesn't he know your affair? -No, he doesn't. What dear? What happened? I have done a mistake. I feel very sad when I see his innocence. I am telling now. Durai Singam only is your groom. Why are you crying? If fallen in love.. ..my legs traiI you on its own If the love is expressed.. ..my eyes circIe you You tricked me niceIy and made me fall in love with you You churn my heart when you twist your sharp mustache Come girl, you're a fresh flower ever! You've a curvy waist and a cooI smiIe Your back is a teakwood.. I get a love fever when I see your bare back I am unable to adorn the dot on centre of forehead It goes awry at your thoughts I am not myseIf like before I've started to treat the culprits gentIy I don't have enough time to talk about you.. The earth doesn't revoIve sIowIy like before I forgot to smear butter on sandwich.. ..but I Iied to mom that I did You courageous! You're FlIIed in my heart Your sharp gIance penetrates me I am always at your thoughts I take the scissors to trim my mustache.. ..but I've cut my nose dreaming about you I practice 10 times a day to adorn the wedding gown I had a strong physique.. ..I became weaker after I met you I was arrogant and witty.. You've made me timid Give me a gIance.. When you look at me, my heart feels eIated Even the moon seems duII before you My heart is FlIIed with joy Sir! -What? -He's stoIen money from the temple cash box and sitting like this. How can a voIcano be patient? -Why did you steaI the money..? -I didn't steaI. I don't like Iiars. Then why did you go to the temple? I went to pray God. What's your name? What is the reIation between Antony and Iyappan? -tell me! -My leg.. -How can I bear this..? -Stop it! Sir, it seems you're going abroad without the passport. Abroad? I am going on the road. Are you traveling in Nano car? -No, No..! -Where are you going so fast? I'll go to jail if I kill you, eIse to heaven. Oh God! It seems like a big post. Sir, you hit the post hard and the lamp is broken. Not only that lamp.. Didn't you see this bulb which is broken inside? ASST.COMMISSIONER OFFICE. Sit down. tell me. My name is Sumathi.. I am staying aIone in a house in ShoIinganaIIur. The rogues in the neighbourhood disturb me for the past 2 months. Why didn't you give the complaint? I came from out of station and staying aIone here. I feel scared that they would torture me if I compIain about them. Today some of them boozed and came home. I was scared and came here without Iocking the door. Why have you come here for that? Why didn't you go to the nearby police station? I heard about you honesty. Hence I came here. See, how we are suffering being from a good family. you only can be able to give the security for us. Please come home once.. Which is your native place..? Which area in Trichy? AandaI street which is near MaIaikaottai. Where are you working? Micro Tech soIution. tell the address where you are staying in ShoIinganaIIur. No:12, vaImigi Nagar. Don't worry. Nothing will happen. I will come with you. I will handle this case personally. tell me, if you get any calls from the commissioner office.. She is a fraud. It will take 20 minutes to reach ShoIinganaIIur. call Trichy and Micro Tech and get the details about her and inform me. Let's arrest her and do the inquiry. They might have a network and let them not escape. That's why I am going with her. Is Sumathi working there as a program assistant? -Is anybody staying here as Sumathi? -No, sir..! She messaged me that she is on the way.. We are ready brother. -tell me, Muruga..! -Address and profession are faIse. Kavya, Durai Singam is there. There is a girl with him. Take a U turn.. follow him. He is going without minding the signal. I am ShoIinganaIIur PC Saravanan speaking. tell me Narayana, how are you? There is no girl in that address which you gave me. And the house has been Iocked for a long time. Ok, tell him that I will come for next temple festivaI. At morning somebody came to her house in car. Sir, we have to go straight to go my house. Catch her. Hey, stop. Stop I say. tell me. -tell.. -Who are you? If you criminals can play with mobiIes and computers.. Then, can't we also do that?

Answer his questions. -will you do it boIdIy? -yes, I can. -Somehow bring him there. -Ok, sir. Our guys will start to shoot him when he comes cIose. DefiniteIy he will die today. The force has started. Ask them to take the position behind the house. tell them to wait till I fire. Durai Singam has come. Stand 30 meters away from that house. Hide behind the bricks or the car. She is not that girl whom we have sent. Get down and shoot him. I don't know how many people are there. How many people are there? -only one guy. -How far is he? 12 to 15 feet. Where are you going fast? I want to meet the one who traces lost people? What did you lose? I lost a jar and I want to file the complaint. Jar? -tell me! -Why are you behaving like this? Why didn't you see me when you went with a girl in ECR? I too saw you. When you saw me you had a shock, and took a U turn.. ..and followed me. I vioIated Kottivakkam signal and crossed. -And you got bIocked. -So, you avoided me intentionaIIy. you were good when you are in village.. ..but are you trying to freak out here? Sir, the news came in evening paper. Ask her to read the news. Read the news.. Morning, there was a big action with the wanted group. But you are giving unwanted reaction without knowing that. -Ok..! -I went to catch the culprits.. But you have followed me. If you follow me who will give you the security? That's why I have avoided you in the signal. I am not suspecting you. My friend Tharika only has confused me. First, cut her friendship.. Now, you stay away from me. Why..? What if I touch you? My father said ok for our marriage.. your father agreed. But the commissioner won't agree this. How will he know? There is a camera in the roof. There is a live reIay in commissioner office about what is happening here. -Is it ok? -Oh gosh! -See you..! -Hey, I just said for fun. shall we go and have the tea?

How many times would you hack this corpse? you damn, he died 12 hours ago. This is a 9mm caIiber gun with a 3mm bullet. He died in the third bullet itseIf when the 4th bullet was in 12feet distance.

I will go on killing all who are connected to you. you won't get the time to feel and cry for them. you will roam and collect the dead bodies. Why did he do like this? you leave for my native. And stay with my parents. Ask my dad not to go to the shop till I tell him. I will talk to Tuticorin DSP and arrange for the security. all the constables go outside. And take the accused also. Sir is coming. Move away. you are the chief of the anti-kidnapping force. What were you doing all these days? We were stopping the kidnapping. Whom did you stop? We were stopping the criminal who had kidnapped 55 people. -Do you know who the culprit is? -yes, I know. Why you didn't take any action after knowing that? -Who..? -Mayil vahanam. Who told you? Without giving any respect to this uniform and this post.. ..he said that he only kidnapped the 55 people and chaIIenged what can I do. Then why don't you proceed and arrest him? NormaIIy, he doesn't get down into the problem. If we take any action on him because of suspicion.. ..an Indian citizen who in need of money ..will accept the crime and face the charges. He is hiding in this confidence all this time. One minute. These files contain the full history of this case. Mayil vahanam has connections to each and every page of these files. But there is no evidence. What are we going to do? What do you mean? He just stopped his business because of my tortures I gave him. We have to finish him before he comes out from that fear. talk like a police officer. Just give me your consent.. I will point in his head and finish him. After that I will handle this case personally. Many parents will be happy. I feel annoyed when I think of this. Despite knowing the culprit I am unable to arrest him. There is no use in becoming emotional. First make the evidence ready. How can we get evidence if there are people like him? Give me your cell phone. Why do you ask his cell phone? The evidence you wanted is only in that. Look at this, sir. The phone was on until 20 seconds ago. Mayil vahanam has heard everything what we spoke for the past 30 minutes. Sir, he called me sometime ago. I forgot to switch-off my mobile. This is last 3 months statement of his phone usage. He has called him atIeast 20-30 times per day. We can get anywhere only if he opens his mouth. Please, all of you go out. These are the evidences to prove your connection with them. And your cell phone. Take all these and go. There is no complaint on you. There is no commission. If I beIittIe you.. ..it is like humiIiating the entire department. you wouldn't have got this job easily.. ..you would've suffered to get this job. you would've had ambitions to prove yourseIf But today.. you are sitting with disgrace in the custody room.. ..without the uniform. will your family members feel happy.. ..if they pubIish in news papers and Tv.. ..that you were an accompIice to Mayil vahanam? will you heIp him, if he kidnaps your daughter? Won't you use the gun and shoot him in the road? people who earn money illegally cannot live a prosperous life I know how to deal with Mayil vahanam. you may go. Please pardon me, Durai Singam. I am a family man. I have two children. I have heIped the kidnapper for want of money. -Give me the gun I will go and.. -No sir! Just tell a single lie. Mayil vahanam has kidnapped my daughter. -What do you mean? -He has asked 45 lakhs as ransom from him He has got 4 crank calls till now. Oh gosh! I didn't kidnap 'this' girl. Do you agree that you kidnapped others? yes, I only kidnapped that 55 people. I have donated to the party fund from that money only. I have printed the posters by using that money.. ..and assembled people for meeting. Is everyone in your party doing IegaI work? Aren't they doing illegal business? How dare you talk like this? I am talking with hope that somehow you will save me from this. hold on the line.. Mayil vahanam is in line. What are you going to do is.. Arrest him within 24 hours and make him stand before me. For this, you can use any team as you wish. -I will speak to the CM. -Hey, what are you talking? We are not dependent on people.. ..who donate funds and people who attend meetings. -Listen to me, no.. -Cut the line. you have saved her from death. Are you sitting happiIy? Are you and the minister pIanning to finish me? Just watch me. I will kidnap the Home minister's daughter tomorrow at 10 o' cIock. I will make the whole Tamil Nadu to get astonished. -What happened Damodaran? -Everything is under control. We made the security very tight in all the check posts. He can't go out of the city. Sir's family is under our security. Don't think everything is under your control! I will kidnap the girl exactIy at 10'o cIock. Do you think that I won't kidnap her if she is under your control? My guys are there in your place. He is insane! Make the security tight in all ministers' houses. It is time to show who am I. I have kidnapped the girl. you are in Tamil Nadu Home Minister Ramanathan's house. But I have kidnapped Karnataka Home Minister's daughter. I've kidnapped the girl who is studying in the Engineering coIIege in Chennai. Look, how I Iocked you. -Listen to me carefully. -Leave me! I have to go to Pondicherry. I shouldn't get any disturbance in my way. I need a siren fixed vehicle in front and behind my vehicle. A boat should wait for me in Pondichery when I reach there. She will stay with me till I reach Hong Kong in that boat. If anything happens to her the whole border from Hosur to Mysore will be on fire. If you want her alive I should go safely. Understood? Give the horn. only then it will move Go along with Mayil vahanam without any disturbance. Durai Singam is following our vehicle. I know very well that you are following me. Turn the vehicle right. AIert all coastguards. What happened Durai Singam? I unable to follow him on road as we thought. I will take the heIicopter and go to Pondichery. There is a speed breaker near Bommayar PaIayam old bridge. We will puncture his vehicle when it reaches there. He will shift to another vehicle with that girl.. ..and at that time I will shoot him. He won't have time for counter action. What if anything happens to that girl..? He won't send the girl back.. ..if he boards the boat with that girl once. We have to take risk and save that girl. We have sent the commanders to Bommayar PaIayam old bridge. -Suppose, if he doesn't get down from the vehicle.. -One minute. Kavya wants to speak to you. I am alright! Take courage. people used to tell the wife should heed husband's words. I didn't obey you. It was my mistake only. What..? I did everything correctIy as you said. But you told me to take left.. -But I took right in a hurry.. -No..! -That's why he shot me. -No... nothing like that. Take care. What did you ask me? If he's not in the vehicle.. No sir, I asked you if he doesn't get down from the vehicle. If he doesn't get down from the vehicle.. He is telling that he is not in the vehicle. Why he should travel in the vehicle? -Did anyone see him inside the vehicle..? -No, sir..! call his personal number. The mobile network says in Telugu that he is not reachable. How can the customer care voice will sound in Telugu.. ..when he is traveling in Thiruvanmayur to Pondichery..? call the number which he used to talk with us.. ..and ask them to trace that where is he traveling. Mayil vahanam is traveling in Andhra, Sullurupeta He was in Gumidipoondi haIf an hour ago. He had started from Chennai one hour ago. Sullurupeta..? There is no chance by road. It is under full surveillance. I will talk with him. Come on let us trace his voice. I stopped to follow you as you said. That girl is important for us. you became nothing now. Why are you challenging with me? Cut the line. Split his voice track separately. you've became nothing now. Why are you challenging me? -Cut the line. -It seems like a train sound. yes, he is traveling in train only. Surely he couldn't have catched the train in Central. Somebody has stopped the Guwhati express in Vyasarpadi.. ..which has started from Central by pulling the chain. The train was 5 minutes late. Definitely they only have boarded the train. Alert Andhra police. Ask them to board the train in Sullurupeta and search them. Shall we stop the vehicle which is traveling in ECR and arrest them? No, they should go without any disturbance. That is only safe for us. Send Mayil vahanam and that girl's photo to Andhra police. -you can follow that. -Ok, I will take care. I am talking from Nellore control room. Come on! Get inside, fast. This train. yes, we should follow this train only. So, land fast. -What..? -Do you need lunch? We will serve you in Nellore at 1 :30, sir. -No..no! -Thank you, sir. Look at this, sir. He is in the first class AC room. -Greetings! -Welcome. It is the time to catch that train. The train hasn't come yet. The police.. The whole Karnataka has become very serious.. -When will we start, sir? -He is under our surveillance only. Let us proceed after knowing his destination. -The train become slow..! -How far Nellore is from here? 8 Kms from here. Hey, who has pulled the chain and stopped the train? Was it you..? -Come fast! -Come! -Ok..! -Come on! It's me guard! you can start the train. Come carefully. -Has everyone vacated their houses? -yes, brother. Pethanayudu's men are coming.. Wait! Sir, this is Putlur. This village is in under Pethanayudu's control. Mayil vahanam sir, greetings. Nobody is in this place. If you take the boat now you've to answer the sea coastguards. If you start after the dark you can catch the Hong Kong ship easily. -What is there outside of this place..? -There is a ocean, sir. We are guarding this place. Be brave. I think Mayil vahanam is going to execute his plan in Nellore.. ..which he planned in Pondicherry. you both stay here. We three will go inside. -There are lot of people sir. -I know! At least two of us should be alive to save that girl. There is no signal in the cell phone. If anything happens to that girl.. Look at those three tube lights.. I will shoot that. You have to come in as soon as I shoot that. I don't know how many of us go back home. But we should go back with that girl only. They shouldn't see us. We should be very careful Hey, who are you? Hey, who are you? I am dead Hey, who are you? Catch him! Come this side. -Sir, no..! -you didn't reform after all this. Hey, who are you? Did you come..? Where are you? Hey, where are you? Have you found me at last? you police..! Are you counting the bullets? I too am counting. There is one more. Hey, don't make me furious again and again. Come out! Look! you go..! you go, I will leave her. I want to escape from here. That's all. you go, I will leave her. Why are you repeating the same out of fear? Is she my niece? Have I come here to take her back? I came here to shoot you. No need to shoot her. I will shoot her myseIf. Don't be panic. Come! I don't have any other way. -I have shot you to save your life. -What happened, sir? I only shot her. I have shot on her hand only. Just stop the train which is coming. And take her to Nellore hospital. Nothing should happen to her. Shoot whoever that crossed your way. It is the time to reach the train. I have the arrest warrant and the shooting order. tell me what I have to do. Didn't I tell you that you only should decide that? What are you going to say..? Didn't you say that if you do anything in Avadi it will reflect in Ambattur.. ..Tambaram and Parrys? There is no refIection now. When has it reflected..? Did you think that the Tamil Nadu police won't take any action.. ..if you change your direction? That day itseIf I won.. ..when you planned to go away because of fear. I would have bid farewell and left you.. But I came here to save and take back the girl you kidnapped. She would get the treatment in Nellore hospital. Now I am not going to arrest and I am not going to shoot you. I will leave you here. I leave you like this. What will you achieve..? will you come back to Tamil Nadu..? If you come back.. 1 lakh constables, 22 thousand Sub inspectors, 7000 inspectors.. ..700 DSP, 120 ADSP, and 235 IPS officers.. Those who are living in Tamil Nadu will shoot you. There is 6.5 crores of people.. If they catch you, they will beat and kill you. you have yelled that Chennai is your fort.. Henceforth you can't be able to enter Chennai. you won't be able to come. I thought. Won't you reform ever? Won't you repent? Just think about the mistakes you have done. I thought to put you in jail.. ..but you've come back to the starting point. If I put you in the jail for 10 years.. ..you would spoil the entire prison. If I put you in the noose.. ..you will spoil the man who puts you in the noose. If the weeds grow between crops we should cut it We shouldn't leave the thorn bush. you have started this in Nallur.. Let me finish it in Nellore. I have finished my job. Now I am resigning my job. Don't mistake me. I wanted to be a grocer in my native place. That is my ambition. Now I am going back to Tuticorin and run the shop. you have decided to go to Tuticorin by driving. I like this. you have resigned your job without informing me. I didn't like that. What to do? Sometimes I couldn't be able to tell you some matters. Just watch yourseIf. Surely you will re-join the police department in 3 months.. Let us see. Give it! Wait.. It seems like a known person's vehicle.. -Just a minute. I will back.. -Ok you have resigned your job in public as we planned. But, the CM has appointed you as the Deputy Commissioner of.. ..Tutricorn city. Sir, tell me the reason of this plan. The Investigation department has got the information.. ..that they are smuggling arms to India through the Tuticorin sea. But there is no information in the police or the coastguard records. you stay like a grocer for 6 months to 1 year. And observe the city and the sea coast. When you feel that you've got all the details.. ..and when the city is under your control.. That day you take the charge. We three only know about this matter. you can inform your wife, if you wish. No, sir! I won't inform this even to my wife. I will bring the entire network under my control.. ...and take charge as soon as possibIe.
