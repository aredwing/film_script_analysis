Why wouldn't you believe me? Lincoln! I believe you. Dozen of major earthquakes... ...from all of nations today are gone through. Middle East, Africa, Central Asia and America, All reported bad damages and casualties... It was religion supporting the beginning of the apocalypse. While the scientific community has refused such claim, they remain unable to saving lives in.... The elevator are broken, Stairway is blocked. Brother decree, now the prisoners be ready for the contest. Only one can be warranted the privilege of joining us... as brother. And so, these three... ... will engage in all fenced combat. to their death. Bring forth the pirate! Who wants challenge him? Don't do it, Captain! I never saw such a highly challenge. You pick, toward! The challenge we hold up for! Finish him! Kill! Kill! ... I apology! You did fight like a gentleman! You fight like a pregnant dog. No! No! Hey! Get ready for this work after all!

The win's taking us sea, over the Indian Ocean. If we're lucky, we'll cross shipping lanes. If not? Loa! Loa, a ship! It's a ship! Sindbad. Loa. Loa! Loa. Loa! The sky will spread by an off order. The evidence are open, and cycling around the globe. Everywhere on this earth the signs are huge! The signs of the coming of the end, ...the earth ... - Loa. The non believers will be punished. - Where is she? - There's no one here! Where is she? Woudn't it matter? We're going to die anyway! - Where is she? Hey! Hey! Loa! Loa! The evil will be punished. The end is polar. It is the total destruction! The believers will be honored ... How many on over.... There's someone in the water. I think I've lost you. It's all my fault. What can I do? - What can I do? The paintings are about the earth. - There'd been six. Tanker! - It's the tanker. You know, Alex, you're good people, loyal. We get out of this, I am personally going to make sure that you'll be well taken care. Here, have a drink! For a while! I leave for 5 years to live at this place! We're calling it the Tromlin's crater. It is 4 miles deep. The Akaba power can't be more than 5 to 6%. When the first bullhead erupts out, the rest will go down like domino. What do these lines explain? These are fields of mineral depostis picked up by multi-beam ultrasound. Buried... 100 meters beneath the sea bottom. Geomorphology suggests they came as the meteoritic from the crater; but ... the signature ... I've never seen anything like that. I drive C-130 dive down deep, empty a place for cargo. What craft, though? The Pytheas. I'm raising the tanker. How remove of some floatings on line? How's it even been tested at the kind of depth? - I'm aware of the risk. But don't you respect, Sir. You're not even trained in that operation? That's why you're going to talk to me to it up here. Our com. network is decimated. - Improvise. Even if I could, the tanker is nearly milion tons of deadth weight! How can you come to the expect to lift it through 4 miles of water, Sir? It's a suicide mission! Not I'm asking for any volunteer! But you'll need one. Because the Pytheas requires two operators. Our brakes on line. Our trans submission nominal. Our tearing cross is checked! Escalate the hydrolic propeller allowed. Take a lay in arm, go! Vital screen in costa board. Stand by first swimming lesson! - Where's Simon, Is he there? - I am here. I know what you did, Simon. Under any circumstance, you'll be fired! You're lucky! I need you right now. Better know expensive clean up! I don't care if you can or can't or let me know! Do you Understand? - Degraves, you're ready? - Controls - ready, Sir. Activating automated navigation! Decoupling setters - 3, 2, 1! Merge! - The craft is in your hand, Captain! - Captain, You have a seat to his left. Depth 1000 feet. Power cells are at 92%. Not bad, Captain! - Seem a natural! Degraves. Detecting an oil leak on turbine transfer comes to seal No 7. Eliminating what you buttoned to have on your hold, hold now! I you see, Loa! Only a mile down and already quick! Sir, I want you to keep an eye on depth at all times. A seal record cracked at 20 thousand feet. Stay not! Stay not! ... I repeat, Stay not any deeper! Twelve thousands. 5 kilometers Can't see them here, Captain! Can't see them up here, Loa! Loa? - We'll try to stablize it. - I can't. We stay out of control! - So try the turbines. - What the hell is that? - I don't think I want to know. - Take it easy, we'll try the full contact! The power is down to 61%. It's running too hot. . I'm going to see if I can abbreviate the vital supporting. - Control the Pytheas. - Degraves. - Degraves. - Where is my plug-in server? What did I miss? Com. link just pukes. Tecko data was down. Too deep for radio. Meaning what? OK! We'll do it on our own! Oh, God! [Auxiliary power: 0%] [Bulkhead failure!] - 15 thousand feet. - 400 thousands gallons loosed. - 1250. This is just start! Unlok eshu. The first bullhead! Beweging sensor! It can't be right! Failed fucking piece, several miles to go! Three... Two... One. Hang on! Now, the arms! Why didn't he kill us? He's mysterious! Switch our seats. - Sindbad, No! ... - Wait! Weather forecast a giant historic... The storm's being stormed and is heading toward coastlines.... ... and continuing inland. The coast guard as well is reporting announce resemble phenomena. and urge people stand on. This is my ship. - Sinbad! - I know, I start to drill. As matter of fact, recent efforts have been roundly failed! Highways and mass transit systems are at full scale! All around, we people are fleeing for their lives. And truly in total chaos! - 4%. - OK! I'm to use all the power to drill. ...Destroys everything in its path. - 2%. - 1%. - Come on! Help! Positive, it'll take our real cars. Come? - The tanker? - Secretly, they're taken back into the sea. They're going back as nothing short as a miracle. Small valves stabilizing for a sense. He did it! It's coming up! You're ready?
