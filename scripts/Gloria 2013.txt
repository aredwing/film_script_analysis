Ever since I got divorced. Oh, yes. You look good. So do you. Cheers! Okay... Okay, okay. Okay, go home! I gave you everything, everything! What for, eh? What for? What are you looking at, man? Are you going to tell me what to do? You know nothing! Nobody knows anything! You are fresh water that can quench my thirst. You are the embrace where my feelings can be. You are the place where I want to return more and more each time. You are the response I couldn't find in my silence. You are my tenderness, my peace, my rhythm, my love, my king. You are what I crave and that in you I find. All that and more... Ana? I haven't heard from you at all lately. I'm at the office, very busy... butjust call me if you feel like it. It's your mother. Kisses. Bye. Hello, Pedro, son... How are you? I hope you're fine. I was calling to check on Raimundo, and to see if you needed anything... Well, that's it. Call me. It's your mother. Just like that... Alright, Mom, I'll put him to bed. I can calm him down... All right, go with your dad. Let's go to sleep, let's go to sleep... - He's fussy, isn't he? - Yeah. Maybe it's the ear infection. Yes, it's probably that. - And you gave him antibiotics... - Yeah, we gave him antibiotics. Oh, well that... screws everything up. When you start with the antibiotics then comes the stomach, the mouth, which sometimes gets these things around the... like fungus, stuff like that... Hello? At least you had the decency to call, Manuela. No, we're absolutely fine here, we're doing great. What? Yes, yes, he's eating. He's making solid poops. Manuela... He hasn't asked about his mom! He doesn't know how to speak! Uttanasana, facing your shins, the posture's concave phase, The next exhalation, Chaturanga dandasana, inclined plane... Bring your elbows together, raise your knees, raise your thighs, Bring your palms together. There... Tilt your head back, let it fall back. Open your spiritual heart bring it back with humility, so that it's as parallel with the floor as possible. And rest on your heels. Well done, Gloria. - Did you like it? - Yes, I did. I just came to check if you were still alive. Bye, good luck. Stop it, Mom. You did really well. - Really? - Yes. You should come more often. - Bye, Ana. - Bye! Theo. Come here. - Hello. - Mom, this is Theo. Hello. Okay, Mom, I'm leaving. We have to go. - Good luck to you. - Take care. - Bye. - Bye. - Nice to meet you. - Yes. Yes! ...phone number... Keep your tears. You won't be the last. Goodbye. The city is humid under a pale sky. And I feel free, free, free, free. - Hello, good evening. - Good evening. - Is this seat taken? - No, have a seat. Thank you. - What was your name? - Guillermo. - Guillermo Valenzuela is my name. - Guillermo Valenzuela. It's always handy to have a lawyer as a friend. Oh, a lawyer. Thanks. You've got a knack for putting on lipstick! You look great! Thanks. Are you always this happy? No. You asked me and I burst out laughing. No. I don't know... Some mornings I'm not. And... sometimes not in the afternoons... ...as well. Like everyone. Yes, of course. Do you come here all the time? Yes... yes, yes. No, not all the time. Sometimes. Whenever I can... whenever I want to. I like coming here, though. I like to come and dance. By yourself. By myself. I'm divorced. - Me too. - Really? For how long? One year. Oh, recently. Finally. Yes. Sometimes it is "finally", right? I'm trying... to change things, life. What's your name? Gloria. What's this? No, Alberto, listen to me, tell her to call... 500... 500, I said? 312... Hold on a second. Victo, Victo, Victo, get this bat out of here! Oh, okay. That cat is disgusting! Why does it come into this house? Hello? Okay. So then... Listen to me... Well... Yes, no, that'll be fine. Okay. Right, you too. Okay, thanks. Bye. Take care. Bye. I don't know if what I don't like about the cat is the cat itself, or the cat's tail. It's like a mouse's. You know that when the universal flood came, the lord ordered Noah to build a very large ark into which he put his whole family and two animals of each species that existed in the world at that time. In a short time, there were many mice, lots, and they began eating all the food. Noah didn't know what to do. So he spoke directly to Yahweh and he told him to find the lion, and stroke its head, like this, three times with his right hand, and the lion, 'Pff!", let out a gush of air, and two cats came out of its nose. Those cats... eliminated the mice. Not all of them, but a lot of them, so order and balance was re-established in the world. We're going to hit our ribs, very softly, We're going to hit our ribs, very softly, there. And we're going to count 1, 2, 3 and then laugh. No, you don't know me... I got your number from the doorman, here where your son lives. I live beneath his apartment, in number 21. Come here, I'm waiting, you asshole! Come here! Exactly. I'm calling because... Do you know what's going on, Mrs. Marina? I think he's having a crisis. Get up? What for? Exactly. Again. Why get up? Answer me! Somebody answer me! Why get up? Look, I'm really sorry to bother you this late at night. It'sjust that... Mrs. Marina, I work. I have to get up early tomorrow, you see? I pay to live a quiet life... No. It doesn't make any sense! Of course. Why be born? What for? It breaks my heart, really... I'm a mother too. It's all rotten out there! No, it's notjust another crisis. It's all rotten, don't go outside! Please listen. Listen to this. I want to die! I want to die! Don't be born, man, don't be born! Hello? This is she. No, why would I be upset? It's fine. Are you asking me out? What a gentleman. There's something, I don't know, it'sjust, your personality, it... it drives me wild. Ever since I saw you I... I couldn't... I can't get you out of my head. I'm constantly thinking about you. It's so physical, so real, what happens to me with you. I thought it was never going to happen again. My head was spinning... And I didn't dare to... It was very difficult. I was too terrified to call you. Until I went for it, luckily. And thank you. Thank you very much for accepting. Thank you. No big deal. Excuse me, would you? Hello? Hello, Susana. Yes, fine, but you don't have to cry. I'm going to do it, before 2 o'clock. Okay? Just like always. What? I always do! Okay, yes. I'm busy now, okay? Yes, yes. I'll make the deposit before 2. Yes. Relax. Bye. So are you divorced or not? Sure I am. But... you get divorced from the woman, not from the children. I... I've been living alone for a year now, and I take care... of the girls. They're... They're very dependant on me, so... they're not used to being without daddy yet. That's the way things are. I used to have a very different life. I was drowning. I was bursting. Ayear and one month ago, I had surgery. - What surgery? - I had a gastric bypass. I used to weigh 117 kilos. - Right... - I swear! I swear it's true! I was huge. No... I decided to change, I had the surgery, and now I'm trying to operate on myself, but on the inside. - Sorry. - Amazing, isn't it? Sorry... Okay. We're going to stop... There we go. Vertigo? Vertigo! This is the hopper, it's where the paintball goes in, okay? This is the trigger. It has a safety. Here. You take off the safety. It's an automatic. - More this way. - This way? Yes, this way. No, that's a tree. The black figure. - You can see it, right? - Yes, I see it. I'm going a bit blind too, but you hit the target! You hit the bull's eye! Good! I love your park. You know... Men like to play war. Yes. Or the paths I haven't walked, Or the paths I haven't walked, or anything, or anyone... I love you. I miss you, I dream of you, I wait for you, I can't live without your kisses. My life is no life if you're not inside me. I love you, I miss you, I dream of you, I wait for you, I'm dying just to see you. How could I not love you, my love, my love, I don't want to lose you. Virginia Acosta, from Vina del Mar, has requested Jeanette's "Why Are You Leaving?" When you had your surgery, did they use a general anesthetic or an epidural? Epidural... I think it's general too. The other kind is local, isn't it? The one they used with me is the kind that goes in the IV... ...and gradually, they start adding more anesthetic. Not like when I was a boy, and I had surgery, and they used chloroform. I'm a little... What's the word...? - Claustrophobic. - Oh, right. - The nurse put the mask on my face... - That's how they did it. I put up a fight, and she called other two nurses, so three nurses were pinning me down... - How horrible. - I started to drift off. They called me "chicken, chicken, chicken... " "Anesthesia" means that all your senses are blocked. - Right... - Yes. My daughter Ana explained it to me. But "Ana" doesn't mean that... - No? - No. What does it mean? "Ana" means... "To sit gracefully". - Is that right? - Yes. Do I look like I'm "seated gracefully" now? Look... You look great. Thanks. ...and to have more love for this country, to recover our love for this country, and not stay in our houses... That's hard. It's hard to love it. But why, my dear? Because so many things have happened that... what Chile used to be now seems like a ghost, as if that Chile were dead, and what was built afterwards is a kind of replica of something that's being devised in some other part of the world, where the driving force is just greed. There aren't any leaders anymore. - No. - There aren't any leaders. What are you going to do? If it's about politicians who are up there, and they're the ones governing, the ones that were chosen. - We have to look to young people. - Yes, I was thinking the other day that they're not being considered at all! - The people are being... - They've been robbed, they're outraged. People consider that all of this... has been an abuse. And if you go to the doctor, you have to pay a fortune, if you have an accident, you have to pay a fortune, excuse me for being self-referential but... - No, it's the truth! - It's the truth! You understand? As a sociologist, you must see it every day. And you, in your store, you see that people have had enough! Although we don't use Twitter or Facebook the very fact that these things exist represents a virtual multitude that needed to get together. And that same multitude, that used to go out and start revolutions, is now leading a revolution that's probably more spiritual. ...all things transform, right? One day, you're the way you were before, or the way I was before, and the next, we're here... That's not what I read in the paper, what I read was that all things transform, and that astonished me. Have you heard about those black holes up there? Yes, I've heard something. Where matter is suddenly absorbed. And the stars go... "I'd like to be a nest if you were a little bird. I'd like to be a scarf if you were a neck and were cold. If you were music, I'd be an ear. If you were water, I'd be a glass. If you were light, I'd be an eye. If you were a foot, I'd be a sock. If you were the sea, I'd be a beach. And if you were still the sea, I'd be a fish, and I'd swim in you. And if you were the sea, I'd be salt. And if I were salt, you'd be lettuce, an avocado or at least a fried egg. And if you were a fried egg, I'd be a piece of bread. And if I were a piece of bread, you'd be butter orjam. If you werejam, I'd be the peach in the jam. If I were a peach, you'd be a tree. And if you were a tree, I'd be your sap... and I'd course through your arms like blood. And if I were blood, I'd live in your heart. " Hello? Hello, Dad? Elena! Hello. How are you? Good. How about you? That's nice. Yes. I've already had lunch. Well, she should take her pills. What can I do about it? I'm here at home. I haven't been feeling well. That's why I haven't been out. What's that? No, I'm not going out today. I'm staying here. Okay. Okay. I don't think so. We'll talk later, okay? Bye. Did you like it? I don't understand, really. I mean... Where are you? Why are you here? Because I'm with you. Why can't you tell them you're with me? Why drag them into a situation that they're incapable of understanding? They'd say, "You have a girlfriend! You silly old man! How could you even think of dating at your age?" They'd make fun of me, and why give them that chance? I don't want to involve them in our thing. No way. No way. I understand that we... that I'm a part of your life, or not? You're the most important part of my life right now. Then I want to feel that, because I'm not, if you're lying to your daughters. - They're grown up, aren't they? - They're not that grown up. Physically they are, but not inside. When I had my surgery, I felt lonelier than ever before. Not one call... Did they even call the hospital and ask how I was doing? Did they care about my health, the operation, or anything? Nothing! Ever. I've always been the one who worries about them and they do nothing in return, do you understand? Nothing at all, it's a terribly lonely feeling. And I don't want you to have to share that, to experience that. And I thank you for understanding me. Who's there? Who is it? What do you want? - What is it? - Open, you fucking door. Gloria... Morning, Mario. I'd like to make a complaint. He said he got confused. He thought it was his apartment. That's why the key wouldn't fit in the lock. This just can't happen, Mario. He's in a bad way, Gloria. - We all can get like that. - He couldn't get in because he couldn't get the key in the lock, so he decided to climb up your balcony. Happy birthday, son! Thanks, Mom. I wish you a good year, a wonderful year! Thanks. - May everything turn out well, okay? - Okay. This will grow back, won't it? - This is Rodolfo. - Hello. Rodolfo. - How's it going? - Happy birthday. Thanks a lot. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Good. - This is nice. - How long has it been? Ana, my sister... Twelve. Twelve years? Twelve years. Thirteen, I think. - Thirteen, twelve... - Flavia? You must be Flavia. Nice to meet you. Same here. You didn't tell me she was so beautiful. - Oh, please! - Beautiful, really. - You haven't introduced us. - Sorry. - Rodolfo... my partner. - How do you do? - Gabriel, my ex-husband. - Nice to meet you. - And Flavia, his wife. - A pleasure. Nice to meet you. - Cheers. - To your birthday. - Happy birthday, son. - Happy birthday. - And cheers... - Happy birthday, little brother. - To your pregnancy. - Cheers. Cheers. Oh, you didn't know. - No, I didn't. You're pregnant? - You hadrt told him? No... Sorry. Oh, really? - How nice... - But it's very recent. - You're not showing at all. - Six weeks. - I see, and do you have a partner? - Yes. That's nice. - Have a seat. - Thanks. She just seems so young! Would you like some peanuts? Sure, yes. Thanks. Olive? Sure, thanks. - Would you like an olive? - Me too. Rodolfo, my mother was telling me that you have a club, an amusement park? Yes. "Vertigo Park". It's a lot of fun. Have you heard of paintball? Yeah, it's shooting... - Yes, with colors... - Is it with paint? Yes, in two teams. It's like a little war. She loved it. - You took her to play? - Yes. It was target shooting. - She can hit the spot. - She sure can, yes sir. - What did you do before? - Transport for the Navy. I was in the Navy for many years. Then I got into transporting different kinds of equipment for them. - Were you an officer? - Yes, of course. - Oh, you were in the military? - The Navy. - Do you have any children? - Yes, two daughters. - How old are they? - 27 and 31. Oh, like us, more or less. Yes, but they're quite different. Are you a grandfather? No, no... - Your daughters aren't married? - No, they're single. - Do they work? - No. - Are they at college? - No. They did go, but they didn't like it, so they switched to a trade, a technical diploma. So you support them... economically. Of course. All of them. And their mother, who also does nothing. - Their mother doesn't work? - No. Oh, no... Don't light it up. She's pregnant! - Alright. - How dare you! The baby's sleeping in the other room! - I'm a smoker. - I want to propose a toast. Atoast. I know, Pedro, it's important to you that we're all here. I know we're all a little surprised by the twists and turns of life. I want to thank Flavia, I want to thank Flavia, for being the architect of this reunion. If you hadrt taken these steps it probably would've been another 10 years before we all got together again. I also want to join this toast to thank you for welcoming me into this family get-together. It's so nice to meet you and to see a family that, I don't know... so much like the family I would've liked to have. Free, different, who know how to live. Thank you very much, and happy birthday, Pedro. - Thank you. - Happy birthday, Pedro. Do you want some weed? No? You don't smoke? - I'm scared of losing control. - Oh, don't be silly! Really, it's kind of... Scared? Quite the opposite, you relax, I don't know... Yes, but... No. Everyone reacts differently. If you don't want any... Thanks. Who's my grandsors father? His name's Theo. - Theo what? - Van Gogh. It doesn't matter. He's Swedish. He's Swedish? And does he live here? No. He lives in Sweden. But he's coming to live here. No. He's staying there. How come? I'm moving there. - She's leaving! - To go to Sweden? Yes, to Sweden. When? - On the 28th. - So soon! Why don't you read the letter? The e-mail, Mom. - The e-mail. - No. Come on, Ana. Read it, so your dad can see... ...that he's a nice person, he's delightful. Actually, we're both a little in love with Theo. No. - Ana. - Cut it out, Mom. - Read it, Ana. - You already read it to us! Yes, but it's different now. "... the only thing I want is to have a life with you. I discovered that the love in my heart was being saved for you. Living the mystery of each day with you is the most profound thing I can imagine. I may have been on the highest mountains in the world, but all the same, the highest thing I can think of is to be with you. " It's so beautiful, what he says. I don't know, but I'm crying over everything. Look at those two! How lovely! The wedding picture. Stiff, like two broomsticks. - And so naive, right? - We were in love. - And we were very naive. - We were in love. Let me see. - Pedro. - Let's do something. - We were in love. - Yes, you were in love. Let's take a photo now. Hold this. Dad, hold it there. Excuse me. No? She's laughing... She's laughing. But we were in love. I don't have this picture. I'll make a copy for you. Look how handsome my Pedro is here! Look, my Anita with her diploma! Pre-school certificate! Look at all the layers on this cake. We didn't get married with just any cake! And your frilly dress! It's hilarious! Well, that's what we wore back then. I was not... I was not here. - You werert? - No, I wasrt. You were already gone by then. Here he is, in the day he went off the rails. Let's see this one... I should've been here, here! And I wasrt. And these bangs...? You know what the problem was? My mom would put gel on a brush, then wrap my bangs around it. - That's how people wore it back then! - That's horrible! Rodolfo, are you all right? He's not here. He isn't? No, Mom, he's not here. I'll call him and see if... - I don't know what... - Do you think he got sick? I don't know. Perhaps the food didn't agree with him. I'm going to call him. Rodolfo, it's me, Gloria. Pick up. What happened? I'm worried. I'm here at Pedro's. It's only a photo. Call me. - He's not in the bathroom... - Sometimes he feels ill, food doesn't agree with him, and... He's not used to French fries... I'm going to... No answer. I'm going. Who is this guy, Mom? I'm working. Rodolfo, I'm busy. I'm working. Don't call me anymore. What are you doing here? Can we talk? I've nothing to say to you. I need you to listen to me. How could you be so thoughtless, Rodolfo? About what? I was introducing you to my family. I took you to my sors birthday... and you have the nerve to disappear? If you were in my place you would've done the same thing. It wasrt an easy situation at all. I searched for your eyes, again and again, and... I didn't exist! I felt sick. I threw up. I don't know how you could do something like that to me. Besides, the girls called. Grow a pair. Excuse me. And take your toy guns with you. No. No, Gloria. As you wish. - Get your hands off, I can't see! - I love you! Gloria. Really! Gloria, listen... That's it... I'm going to check this eye... Don't squint in this eye. You can blink, but don't squint or I can't see anything. There. That's great there. So how are your children? Hold on. If you talk, your eye moves and I can't see. Hold on a second. I always tell my patients they should come once a year, because illnesses can arise. And your test says that you've developed glaucoma. I'm going to go blind? Not necessarily. But in time, if you don't take care of it, your field of vision will diminish and that will limit your daily life, driving, getting around... I'm giving you these drops, to be used once a day for the rest of your life. Here. I'm getting out to see you off. No, Mom. It's so I can help you with your suitcases, Ana, they're really heavy. No, Mom, really, just leave me here, please. I'm not going to cry! I'll walk you to the entrance. Mom, no. Okay. Take care, will you? Yes. Send me an e-mail when you get there. - "I'm here" is all I need. - Yes, Mom. That's fine. I love you very much. - A lot. - Me too. I love you very much. Alright. Go. Bitch, bitch! That's what you are. Shit... That's what you are, shit! Fucking bitch! We loved each other! We loved each other! What's the use of it all? Nothing! Now and forever! Now and forever! Madam... Who wears the britches? Is it the students or the sons of bitches? Let's see, let's see... Who wears the britches? Is it the students or the sons of bitches? Look at how the skeleton moves how it shakes all over. Look at how the skeleton moves how it shakes all over. Look at how the skeleton moves how it shakes all over. Look at how the skeleton moves how it shakes all over. Hello. - Good afternoon. - How are you? - I have a reservation. - Under what name? Rodolfo Fernandez. Fernandez? Yes. One moment. My girl? Hello. What's happened now? I'm in Vina, why? What? But how... How did she go through a window? God, what a stupid thing to do! How deep are her cuts? I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I can't come now, I'm busy. The doctors can take care of it. I have to do my things, please! What happened? My ex-wife has had an accident. One of my daughters called me. Susana went through a window, the glass was really clean, she didn't see it, and... she smashed through it. She cut herself badly... on her legs. Such a stupid thing. But, I'm not moving from here. I'm staying with you. They're not going to ruin this moment, are they? It's what I want, and... I'm not going to let them mess with my life this time... and stop me from living... my life. I'm staying here with you. Gloria? Gloria! You're doing the right thing. It's fine. I appreciate your insight, your help... but you may not be able to see how hard it is for me. It's hard because I know how much they need me, you see? How can I not see if I'm looking straight at you? But it's not only bad for them to depend on you so much, it's bad for you too. My love, you have the right to a life. Yes. Shall we travel? To the south, 10 days, just the two of us? Better still, the Caribbean. Let's go to Cuba. Have you ever been to Cuba? Let's go to Cuba for 10 days. We skip work and go, the two of us. We both like dancing, so let's go dancing in Cuba! Just switch it off. Alright. Cheers. To traveling? - I'll be right back, excuse me. - Yes. Rodolfo. Thank you. Can I get another one, please? No more bets. - Black on four! - Four on the black. It's weird to bet on 11, if my favourite number is 27. And that's my birthday. Then we'll bet them all. - What's your name? - Gloria. - Marcela. Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Let's see how we do. No more bets. - My love. - Oh, thanks, honey. Red 27. - We won! - You won! - We won! - No, good job! This is Gloria, my new friend. - Hello, how are you? - Fine. - Marcial, a friend... - Hello, Marcial. How are you? Cheers! Come on, honey... No, no, no... You don't know... Have faith! Hold on tight! Hold on! One... Two... Three... I'm with you! I'm with you. Let's go! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. - A question. - Go ahead. Has Mister... Fernandez come back? - Room number? - 306. It says Mr. Fernandez hasn't checked out yet. What time does the room have to be paid for? Check-out time is in 20 minutes. May I use your phone to call Santiago? Yes, of course. The number? 639... 58... Gloria. I brought your things. Thank you, Victoria. - I'll take the cat away. - Just leave him... Alright then... What happened? What happened? Right. Give me my pajamas. Gloria. Hello? Are you there? Say something. Please, I'm begging you. We need to save what we have... We had something special... Who is it? Your neighbor, from upstairs. Come in. He's in the main bedroom. Excuse me. Where have you been? Yes... What were you doing here? I'm sorry. Have you, by any chance... Maybe you found... The other night... I was kind of... The night I got confused, did you by any chance find... a packet? A little packet? No. Gloria... Gloria! No! Dad? Dad? - What happened? - Daddy, what happened? Quick, help me get him up! Get him up! Who do you think you are, you fucking old bitch? Come back here and show your face, bitch! - Good evening. - Hello. A goddess. I'm so glad you made it! - I couldn't make it to the church. - That's okay. It's so good you're here. Don't worry. Don't explain, I'mjust so happy you're here. It's so nice. What's wrong? Gloria, you're missing in the air, your presence is missing, your warm innocence, you're missing on my lips, which call you without wanting to, and I will write my story with the word "Gloria". Because here by your side the morning becomes bright... - Would you like to dance? - No, thanks. Truth and lies are called Gloria. Gloria, you're missing in the air, you're missing in the sky, burn me with your fire, melt me in the snow that freezes my chest. I'm waiting for you, Gloria.
