The train has arrived at Athens Central Station, and will be departing shortly. Passengers are kindly requested to disembark. The winter of '84 was pure hell. Night after night you'd walk in the rain, praying that the music would never end... and the only thing you really needed, would be a warm girl. Star? Hooker! Don't let me cramp your style... Is this Cine Star at Omonia Square? What are you, psychic or something? Jimmy, you old bastard... nice one! Jimmy, you grave digging bastard! A cozy little nest... and in the penthouse too! - Did you shave? - You bet I did. You have reached the funeral home of Dimitris Dimitriou. Please leave your message after the tone. Where the hell are you, Jimmy boy? Where are you, man? You pulling a no-show on me? You're nowhere to be found, man... I'm here! Came in last night, on the locomotive. I'm now at... ...Disco Zardoz. Don't stand me up, buddy! Miss you, man! Later! May...hem! Give it to me straight and solitary... What? What's up? What time does this place get hopping? It doesn't, really. It doesn't, huh? What do you know about it, dearie? You're just a boy. Let granny show you how it's done. What'cha want, sweetheart? Get me another. Theresa is pretty bombed, huh? Yeah, same goes for your joint! Hey, I'm not the captain here. I'm just the cabin boy. Where's Jimmy at, man? Jimmy who? Jimmy, the man, The Shovel, the Pale Face... - You mean the gravedigger? - Right, the gravedigger. I haven't seen him for over a month. You seem cornered. The boss... On the house. So where are you from, pal? Just cause you bought me a drink don't mean you get my CV. What's wrong with getting to know your customers better? Need a hand? Beat it! Will you pick up my gear? Can't tell if the dope is bad... or I just can't get high anymore. Are you one of us? So it seems. You bite? I haven't sucked blood in over ten years. I got hooked on dope. It's all about willpower, man. Godam hell dust! Need anything else, or are you good to go? Huh? I see grief inside you. Whoa, Hold on just one second... What are you... a gypsy fortuneteller now? These eyes have seen a lot. Why don't you keep it to yourself then? Be careful, man... You're not gonna give me the time of day, will you? This is classic Casablanca. Moving on.. Hit me! "Hold on to the Night" "Hold on tight" "Hold on to the Night" "I'll fall into your arms" "Cover your empty heart like a blanket" "Hold on to the Night, tight" ls the party over? The party hasn't even started. You passed out on the dance floor. Who are you, again? I'm the captain. The boss, so to speak. That's me. Marko is the name. The cops raided the place and we had to drag you up here. We wouldn't wanna get busted. Want some tea? Tea? Are you trying to poison me? Got any gin? Sure I do. Are you an actor? I used to be... I'm a business man now. You're pretty good... You know what I liked about the movies? No, I don't. The characters I played will never die, I'm kind of immortal in a way. You got a phone? Fucking spoilsport! Sorry. You look pale. Do you want some soup? I've already eaten. Take a seat. I'm feeling lonely tonight. The party never ends. I'll get you some soup. Nice and hot. It has garlic in it. You don't mind garlic, do you? No, not really... I eat everything. That's why you're all sturdy, and I'm just an old fart. About that phone... Next to the cloakroom. Feed it some change, will you? You have reached the funeral home of Dimitris Dimitriou. Please leave your message after the tone. Jim... Jimmy boy. Your answering machine is really busting my balls, man! Pretty soon we'll be exchanging recipes, your answering machine and I. I've been waiting all night, man! Have a heart, buddy... Look, I'm off now, Be back in the morrow. Or you can drop by Cine Star later. For tea and biscuits. We can read the Bible or something... Later... What's up, little man? Looking good! Were you with Marko? Is he watching his films again? Something like that... I used to be an actor too, you know! No shit! Just like Valentino. Can you spare some change for a vermouth? Hey lady... you're some kind of lady! I sure am. Not a klutz, like you. OK, that was unfortunate, but before that... You were a real angel! You hardly touched the ground. So, what makes you tick? Me? I love Horis Perideraio... Aha! Vangelis... Aha... The Synthetics... Mmmmm What are you looking for? I'm looking for something, alright. Aren't we all? Don't you ever stop dancing? If I stop, I'm dead meat. You already seem pretty dead to me! I see. Can't blame me for trying... I guess my little dance routine was all for nothing. What dance routine? You know, the routine! Brezhnev...? Nureyev...? Brilliant! Never seen you here before... We should do this more often, then! - I have to go. - What does this loser want now? Where are you off to? My name is Zano. I'm Theresa. We met earlier. - I don't remember you. - Really? How come? Leave it to me... you're just a boy. Let granny show you how it's done. Oh my, what big teeth you have! Fuck it! Zano... Howdy, Zano? What have you done? I was going to fucking bite you, but I changed my mind! I have to go. Where to? I have work to do. What kind of work? Never mind him... What about us? Quick trip to Acapulco? Or maybe Majorca? Look, I've got a job for you. Are you up for it? Do you ever stop dancing? If I stop dancing... If the rhythm stops... my heart will stop beating. Are you a poet or a vampire? Look, do this one thing for my boss and we'll... dance, alright. Your boss... Who's your boss? Since when do we have a boss? Are you up for it or not? Do you take me for a sucker? You do, don't you? Alice! That's it! Well done! Enjoy it while it lasts! I'm too old for that shit. Mine are false. They rattle like a snake every time I take 'em off. Behave... Well done! - Did you hear what happened to Anita? - No, what about her? - Marko is going out of his mind... - Who is this loser? Anita was turning tricks at Cine Star, the movie theater. She was butchered... How about a little spanking? They found her in pieces. You'll tell me all about it later. Bring it round, will you? So, how about a ride? Hold on... that's it. Cover up, or you'll catch a cold. Well done! A ride to where? Just a ride. What about that fruitcake? We'll take him with us. Speak up, are you in? Where did you get those wheels, man? Get in, silly! it's not mine, I borrowed it. Come on! Athens! What was that, honey? Can you put on the radio? Got any family in Athens? No. An aunt, an uncle... What are you, a cop? First it's the third degree, then it's handcuffs and then off to jail? Alice... Alice... Yes. In wonderland. This must be Peter Pan then! So who am I? The designated sucker? You? You're my boyfriend, Zano. Tonight you are my boyfriend. "You are my boyfriend, Zano. Tonight you're my boyfriend". Are we there? No. SQ? There's something I need to take care of. Oh? I won't be long. Will you take care of junior, here? We'll be just fine... won't we? Ok! I'll give you the royal treatment. Put 'em up, champ! Hands off, you old fart! Something smells fishy. You're chocking me, motherfuckers! I wasn't long, was I? A real lady. Right on time. Can you turn that piece of junk down? Why did you tie him up? We were playing Hangman. He was gonna fall and... it's a long story... Let's move on. Were you throwing a barbecue in there? It was all smoky and shit. Yes, a barbecue. Sort of. Let's get burned! "Electric Angel" "The fever resides inside" Electric Angel" Is this really necessary? You know the drill. If the rhythm stops... ...your heart will stop beating, we got it. But turn it down, will you honey? You'll wake up the werewolf. So, what about Norway? You guys barely survive up there, right? A frozen kingdom! Are you having a good time, you crazy fuck? Are we lost? We're almost there! So... how about it? How about what? Well... you know... - What, here? - Yes... Somewhere around here, I don't know... Behind a tree or something... I don't know. I thought we'd save the best for last. Get the job done first. Is that all I am to you? Just another job? Come on... Look who's talking now! Fine, let's get it over with. You better behave! Come on... Here's fine. That's it... You're not gonna bite me, will you? In the throes of passion and all that? ...a warm girl. Oh I'm warm alright. But you're stone fucking cold! You don't have a heart, do you? Did that bloody Norwegian pull a disappearing act with my stereo? No way, he must be around here somewhere. Peter! That's the spirit. We've got work to do. Peter! Peter! Petros... Piotr... Mum and dad are looking for you! Zano... Do you think something happened to him? Like what? He's a big boy, I'm sure he's fine. Seriously? He was totally wasted and... And? And, he was... you know. And? Stop it, Zano! Come on, let's go this way. - There he is. - Where? Where's my stereo, you little shit? Are we there yet? We're here. What is this place? You don't suppose little miss sunshine over there... ...will throw us in a dungeon, like Kolokotronis, do you? Are you familiar with Kolokotronis? Let me ask you something. This job we're supposed to do... Do you even know what it is? No. No? Not exactly... I was only told to bring you here. Him, too? Him too, yes. OK... Can you see anything? Fuck-all. Don't I know you from somewhere? Come on. That's more like it. "Dracula, Dracula, Dracula" "Why did I have to steal your kiss?" "I rule over your life" "Attract you like a magnet" "I will rule over your thoughts" "You can escape me no more" "Dracula, Dracula, Dracula" "We are yours by the thousands" "Body and soul at your command" "You may torment us" "as long as you give us the kiss of life" "Dracula, Dracula, Dracula" Hello, my friends! I'm so glad you've come! Let me introduce myself. My name is Bram Stoker. Bram Stoker? The Norwegian is back! Excuse me, what did he just say? I don't speak the lingo... - Who is he? - Who, him? He's Bram Stacker. The author of Dracula. Ever heard of Dracula? He's just a sack of bones, man! 100 years old and counting! He's on life support. He's got one foot in the grave, no joke! That's why you're here... He's the job? Yes... That's fucked up! All you have to do is bite him. Give him eternal life. Are you friggin' kidding me? No fucking way. He's gonna make it worth your while. I don't give a fuck. Why are you so negative all of a sudden? I don't feel like biting him. And you know what? He's not who he says he is. And even if he was, I still wouldn't give a fuck! Fine, so he's not Bram Stoker. A little white lie, to entice you. Will you bite him? Junior here can do it. Who, Peter? Peter is not fully transformed yet... You conniving little bitch... How do you know so much about my kind? Did you set me up? Who the fuck are you? Who are these people? Who is this guy? Mach das! (Do it!) Well, it just so happens I speak German... and this is fake... What is this? No way man! No way! Adolf Hitler? Hey, Norway... What did the old fart do to you? This is where I stop dancing. The fucking music has stopped, too. "Norway is too far away "We better go to Athens" "Norway, is too far away" "We're better off in Athens" I guess you took me up on that dungeon, huh? Looks that way... Just like Kolokotronis! You guys have it all sorted out, don't you? What did you expect? I was asking for it... I guess... So what about us? What about us? We could have had something... I could have been your boyfriend... We could have worked it out... Look, Zano... the others are getting impatient out there. If you don't do the job.. They will off you. Get the job done, get your money and get gone. In time, they will forget about you. You tramp... you dirty little bitch! Get the job done... get the money... get gone... and everything will be fine. G'dav to you! You again, you pathetic excuse for a man! Watch your tongue! I'll slash you right open... You can fart on my balls! Why don't you turn the old man, so we can all go home? Do it yourself, you slobbering idiot! With my blood? He'll go into toxic shock! Do you have any idea who he is? He is a big deal... and you're nothing but a dipshit. Oh, he's a pretty big asshole, alright! One to the left, one to the right. I will slash you right open... Just like Jesus Christ... it's a full house! You didn't seem to mind when I wined you and dined you back at my joint! Do the job, you dead man! No... Jimmy. What the hell are you wearing Jimmy boy? Athens is a tough place to be, man. You grave digging scum... What did I tell you, you moron? Didn't I tell you to sit tight? Now... Now what, man? Once a crow, always a crow. I love you, man. You set me up. You set me up, alright. I made you a designer coffin with the Sistine Chapel on it. I'll even throw in a Cadillac hearse. Get the job done and go back home! Go back to the ground man. Everyone's waiting! Who's everyone? Everyone's waiting... Three's a crowd, man! You have reached the funeral home of Dimitris Dimitriou. Please leave your message after the tone. Jimmy...? I hope you're ready. Oh, I'm ready! But get me away from this relic, he fucking reeks! The people await. The people... What are you doing? So how about it? Feel like dancing now? I don't believe you. Bite him! Bite him! Bestow eternal life upon him. How about I bestow my balls on you, instead? Bite him! Bite him! Bite him! Bite him! The winter of '84 was pure hell. Night after night, you'd walk in the rain... praying that the music would never end. If I stop dancing, you'd say... "my heart will stop beating". Since when do the damned, wear shiny shoes? Since when do they dance under disco balls, amidst colorful scoundrels... under neon lights... amidst the smoke and ruins. Are you a fucking vampire... or are you a poet? The dead, you say, don't dance. Some of them, honey, even dance under the ground. "In Norwegian waters, night after night," "people choose eternal life," "under the water, in sub-zero temperature, " "lazy leaps." "Norway..." "Norway..." "Even if none of us were walking against your snow white backdrop" "Even if none of us were walking against your snow white backdrop" "Your white backdrop" "Encrusted in ice..." "Norway's deepest secrets..." "melt slowly away... it'll be a while" "Cold hearts don't melt, only the ice around them" "Cold hearts don't melt, only the ice around them" "Norway descends upon the Mediterranean" "Norway's coming" "it's near" "Norway is near you."
