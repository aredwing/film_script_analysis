WHAT'S UP Y'ALL. YES INDEED. I'M A GET RIGHT TO IT 'CAUSE UM, I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL BEEN WANTING TO KNOW. EVER HAVE YOU NOTICED THA WHEN IT COMES TO BOMBS BLACK FOLKS AIN'T NEVER INVOLVED. WHENEVER THEY CART SOMEBODY AWAY FOR BLOWING SOMETHING UP IT AIN'T NEVER NO BLACK PERSON. YOU KNOW WHY DON'T YOU? YOU HAVE TO BE ON TIME TO MESS WITH BOMBS. CAN YOU IMAGINE A BLACK PERSON TRYING TO DELIVER A BOMB? THEY'RE LIKE - OH NO! (SFX: CLOCK TICKING) OH NO... OHHHH! I AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT! UH-OH! BOOM! (SFX: EXPLOSION) I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY MAN, TODAY, THAT'S STILL DOING IT, WHO HAS A LONG CAREER THA DIDN'T GO TO ALL JOKES ASIDE. ALL JOKES DURING THAT PERIOD WAS THIS GREAT INCUBATION OF SOME OF THE GREATER COMICS WE HAVE. IF YOU WENT OVER THE ROSTER OF COMICS THAT PLAYED ALL JOKES ASIDE IT WOULD BE A WHO'S WHO OF COMEDY. JAMIE FOXX...DAVE CHAPPELLE... STEVE HARVEY...CHRIS ROCK... BILL BELLAMY,,,EARTHQUAKE... TOMMY DAVIDSON...MO'NIQUE... ADELE GIVENS...ARIES SPEARS... BERNIE MAC...D.L. HUGHLEY... LAURA HAYES...T.K. KIRKLAND... SHERYL UNDERWOOD... DON D.C. CURRY... A.J. JAMAL...MIKE EPPS...DAMON WILLIAMS...CARLOS MENCIA... CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER... MELANIE COMARCHO...DEON COLE... ANDRE KELLEY...J. ANTHONY BROWN...MIKE BONNER... GEORGE WILLBORN...ALI LEROI... RODNEY WINFIELD...JONATHAN SLOCUMB...CRAIG ROBINSON... HONEST JOHN...TONY SCULFIELD... GEORGE WALLACE...JB SMOOVE... LAVELL CRAWFORD... THE ORIGINAL KINGS & QUEENS OF COMEDY, HEY MUTHAFUKA, DON'T COME BACK HERE... I DID A SHOW AT ALL JOKES ASIDE, AND I GOT ABOUT FOUR STANDING OVATIONS, ABOUT THE BEST SHOW I'VE HAD AT THE PARTICULAR TIME IN MY CAREER. WHENEVER ANYONE ASKS ME HOW I GOT MY START I DON'T HESITAN TO MENTION ALL JOKES. ALL JOKES WAS A COMEDY CLUB, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, THREE SIXTY-FIVE A YEAR. OH, YEA! NOT ONLY WAS THE CLUB A GREA BLACK COMEDY CLUB, IT WAS A GREAT COMEDY CLUB PERIOD. YOU KNOW WHY THEY DON'T TAKE BLACK HOSTAGES, DON'T YOU? 'CAUSE WE'RE BAD BARGAINING CHIPS. WHAT ALL JOKES ASIDE MEANT TO THE BLACK COMEDIAN WAS SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE, WHICH WAS OPPORTUNITY. YOU COULDN'T JUST BE BLACK, YOU HAD TO BE BLACK AND FUNNY AND GOOD AT ALL JOKES. TO SEE A BLACK CLUB THA ALLOWED US TO SAY WHAT WE FELT, UNCENSORED, I THOUGHT I WAS IN HEAVEN. YEAH, DIVORCE IS ROUGH, BU THAT'S ONE THING I GOTTA GIVE CREDIT 'BOUT WHITE MEN. WHITE MEN DON'T GET NO DIVORCE, THEY KILL THEIR WOMEN. ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS THE FIRS FIVE-STAR BLACK COMEDY CLUB, PERIOD. ALL JOKES ASIDE OPENED ITS DOORS IN CHICAGO'S SOUTH LOOP IN 1991. SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTAN COMEDIANS IN AMERICA GOT THEIR START... MISS ADELE GIVENS Y'ALL, GIVE IT UP FOR HER. POLISHED THEIR ACT... MR. JAMIE FOXX Y'ALL, GIVE I UP FOR HIM. OR MADE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES... MR. STEVE HARVEY Y'ALL. AT ALL JOKES ASIDE. WHEN THEY CLOSED, OH GOD, I WAS LIKE, OUCH! UNTIL IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND AVOIDABLE DEMISE IN 2000... WHEN THE CLUB CLOSED DOWN MAN, I WAS LIKE, GODDAMN! IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL BLACK-OWNED COMEDY CLUBS IN THE COUNTRY. CAUSE EVERYBODY WHO TOUCHED THAT STAGE GOT BETTER BY TOUCHING THAT STAGE. THESE COMEDIANS WOULD GO ON TO CHANGE TELEVISION, THE MOVIES, AND POP CULTURE. TOGETHER, THEY RODE THE LAS WAVE OF THE STAND-UP TSUNAMI, AND MADE ALL JOKES ASIDE AN IMPORTANT STOP ON THEIR ROAD TO STARDOM. WHY? BECAUSE FOUNDER RAYMOND LAMBERT AND HIS PARTNER JAMES ALEXANDER, PROVIDED THEM WITH A ONE-OF-A-KIND CLUB, WHERE THEY WOULD BE TREATED WELL.. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I FEL LIKE A PROFESSIONAL. PAID WELL... ALL JOKES ASIDE HAD CHECKS. AND RECEIVED WELL... WHEN THEY LOVED YOU IT WAS RIDICULOUS. IF THEY TOOK THEIR COMEDY, THE AUDIENCE, AND RAYMOND LAMBER SERIOUSLY. YOU SEE, RAY RAN ALL JOKES ASIDE LIKE A BUSINESS...A FUNNY BUSINESS. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS OF ALL JOKES ASIDE, YOU NEED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RAY LAMBERT, AND ABOUT CHICAGO. LET'S START WITH RAY. HE WAS BORN IN 1961 AND GREW UP IN WILMINGTON DELAWARE. HE LIVED IN A WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS NINETY-NINE PERCENT BLACK. HE WENT TO A CATHOLIC PREP SCHOOL THAT WAS NINETY-NINE PERCENT WHITE. HE WASN'T A GREAT STUDENT, BU HE WAS A GOOD BASKETBALL PLAYER, SO NATURALLY, HE GRADUATED. (TOGA! TOGA! TOGA!) AFTER TOTAL IMMERSION IN WHITE CULTURE DURING HIGH SCHOOL, RAY CHOSE HISTORICALLY BLACK MOREHOUSE FOR COLLEGE. HIS REASONING? IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR DOCTOR KING, JULIAN BOND & SPIKE LEE, WHY NOT RAY LAMBERT? HE GRADUATED IN 1983, THE TOP STUDENT IN MARKETING AND ARMED WITH HIS NEW DEGREE, AND HIS NEW EGO, HE GOT HIS FIRST JOB IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA. (SFX: CROW) HE QUICKLY LEFT THE "CORN HUSKER STATE" AND GOT HIS MBA AT VIRGINIA'S DARDEN SCHOOL. SAME REASONING, IF VIRGINIA WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR FOUNDER THOMAS JEFFERSON... EHH, YOU GET IT. AFTER GRADUATION RAY LANDED ON WALL STREET. SOON AFTER, HE WAS OFFERED A GREAT GIG IN CHICAGO. ALL RAY KNEW ABOUT THE "WINDY CITY" WAS WHAT HE'D SEEN ON TV. YOU KNOW, MOBSTERS, CROOKED POLITICIANS, AND THE MOS SEGREGATED BIG CITY IN AMERICA. BUT HE WAS TOLD WITH NEW MAYOR DALEY AND GOVERNOR "BIG JIM" THOMPSON AT THE HELM, THOSE DAYS WERE OVER. BY THE WAY, THOMPSON WAS GREAT, BECAUSE HE'S AN ILLINOIS GOVERNOR WHO DIDN' GO TO JAIL. THE MAYOR AND I ARE OBVIOUSLY DELIGHTED BY THIS... WELL, UNDER THESE GUYS, CORRUPTION MAY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY REDUCED, BU SEGREGATION WAS STILL AN ISSUE, BECAUSE CHICAGO WAS, AND ACCORDING TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE, STILL IS, THE MOS RACIALLY SEGREGATED BIG CITY IN AMERICA. Y'ALL MY PEOPLE. NOW LET ME HEAR THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE. INITIALLY, SEGREGATION TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD THING FOR RAY'S COMEDY CLUB. BUT LATER IN OUR STORY... SFX: SCREECHING TRAIN NOT SO GOOD. BUT LET'S GET BACK TO RAY'S NEW GIG IN CHI-TOWN. IT WAS WITH LEGENDARY INVESTMENT BANKER CHRIS GARDNER, OF GARDNER RICH & COMPANY. DO NOT CONFUSE YOUR NET WORTH WITH YOUR SELF WORTH. YEAH, THAT CHRIS GARDNER. OUR NEXT GUEST HAS A REMARKABLE RAGS TO RICHES STORY, HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, "THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS" IS OU IN HARDBACK AND THE MOVIE VERSION OF HIS LIFE STORY STARRING WILL SMITH IS SUPPOSED TO BE RELEASED LATER THIS YEAR. CHRIS GARDNER CAME TO CHICAGO TO START HIS OWN COMPANY, WHICH IS NOW A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR VENTURE. IF YOU LOOK A AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO'VE DONE EXTREMELY WELL IN AMERICA, A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THEM MADE IT HAPPEN IN CHICAGO. SO WASN'T NOTHING USUALLY ABOUT A YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMING TO CHICAGO WITH A VISION AND A DREAM. CHRIS IS THE CONSUMMATE ENTREPRENEUR, AND IF YOU'RE NOT INSPIRED BY CHRIS, THERE'S SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOU. RAY LAMBERT WAS A VERY BRIGHT, AMBITIOUS, BUTTON DOWN MOREHOUSE MAN. AND LET ME SAY THIS, I WOULDN'T HIRE ANOTHER BROTHER FROM MOREHOUSE RIGHT NOW IF I WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING. CHRIS LOVED ME AT GARDNER RICH AND I QUICKLY BECAME CHRIS' RIGHT HAND MAN AND I WAS MAKING MORE MONEY THAN MY FATHER, A SHOP FOREMAN, EVER DREAMED OF MAKING, BU SOMETHING WAS MISSING. AND THEN IT HAPPENED... SFX: DRUM ROLL THE INCITING INCIDENT. IN 1990 RAY MADE A TRIP TO HOLLYWOOD... AND STUMBLED INTO BUDD FRIEDMAN'S WORLD FAMOUS IMPROV COMEDY CLUB. IT WAS "MO BETTA MONDAY", THE ONCE A WEEK BLACK SHOWCASE AND D.L. HUGHLEY WAS ON STAGE. I SAW THE DUMBEST SIGN IN THE WORLD IN LOS ANGELES TODAY. A SIGN THAT SAID, "DON'T DO DRUGS, CALL A FRIEND." WHO IS THIS SIGN FOR,'CAUSE BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER. CAN YOU IMAGINE ONE OF THESE GUYS CALLING THEIR FRIENDS? HEY MAN, I'M IN TROUBLE. I'M ABOUT TO HIT THE PIPE. DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL WE GE THERE. COME ON POOKIE IT'S A PARTY OVER AT MADMAN'S HOUSE, LET'S GO. THAT NIGHT RAY SAW A LOT OF GREAT COMEDIANS... I'M SWEATIN' LIKE A BLACK MAN ON JEOPARDY. THEY SEEMED LIKE REALLY NICE PEOPLE... I HATE MY KIDS! AND NO DOUBT EASY TO WORK WITH. THAT'S WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF BUDD FRIEDMAN AND I THOUGHT, MAYBE I COULD OWN COMEDY CLUBS, BUT TARGETING THE BLACK AUDIENCE. SO HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR MENTOR, CHRIS GARDNER, YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT LEAVING HIM, AND BECOMING A COMEDY CLUB OWNER LIKE BUDD FRIEDMAN? RETURNING TO CHICAGO, RAY DID A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING, AND A LOT OF RESEARCHING AND HE DISCOVERED THERE WERE COMEDY CLUBS EVERYWHERE. THE COUNTRY HAD A NEED TO LAUGH WE'D BEEN THROUGH A LO OF TROUBLES AND SUDDENLY THIS THING CALLED STAND-UP BECAME HOT. AND IT GOT HOTTER AND HOTTER AND HOTTER. THE BOOM WAS HAPPENING IN STAND-UP. AH, IT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU KNOW, PRIOR TO THAT YOU HAD SECOND CITY, YOU HAD ZANIES, THAT WAS ABOUT IT. SO IN CAME... THE LAUGH FACTORY CATCH A RISING STAR THE IMPROV THE FUNNY FIRM I CAN'T EVEN NAME ALL THE CLUBS THAT STARTED POPPING UP AROUND TOWN. THEY WEREN'T HIRING THE BLACK COMEDIANS BACK THEN. THERE WERE NO COMEDY CLUBS THAT CATERED TO BLACK COMEDIANS. WE DID USE BLACK COMEDIANS BU THEY TENDED TO BE BLACK COMEDIANS THAT WERE MORE MAINSTREAM. THE ONLY COMICS WHO WOULD GE IN A PLACE LIKE THAT WAS SOMEONE LIKE... I DON'T WANNA. MICHAEL WINSLOW, THE COMEDIAN FROM "POLICE ACADEMY." SFX: ENGINE REVVING BEING IN THE MAINSTREAM, QUOTE END QUOTE, WHITE CLUBS IT WAS A FRATERNITY, YOU HAD TO JUMP OVER PITS OF FIRE. IF A COMEDIAN TENDED TO WORK JUST TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY, THEN THEY DIDN'T APPEAL TO THE GENERAL AUDIENCE, AND SO THEY WEREN'T THE BEST SUIT FOR OUR CLUB. IN THE MAINSTREAM CLUBS THEY ALWAYS HAD JUST A BLACK NIGHT, WHICH SUCKED. CHOCOLATE SUNDAYS, HO CHOCOLATE, TOO FUNNY CHOCOLATE. JUST CALL IT WHAT IT IS, THE NIGHT WHEN A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE GONNA BE THERE. IT WAS NEVER NO BLACK CLUBS THAT WAS CLASSY, IT WAS MORE BARS AND LOUNGES, AND NIGHCLUBS. WE WOULD HAVE TO TRY AND GO TO LARRY'S BAR GRILL AND GE LARRY LET YOU HOOK UP A MIC AND ENTERTAIN DRUNK CUSTOMERS. AT ONE ONE-THIRTY IN THE MORNING THEY HAD TO CLEAN THE DRINKS FROM ONE-THIRTY TO TWO-O'CLOCK. AND SO YOU GOT TO TELL JOKES AND THEY WOULD GIVE YOU FIFTY DOLLARS. I CAN'T IMAGINE PEOPLE WHO, WHO LOVE ARTS AND LOVE TO DO COMEDY NOT HAVING AN IMPROV. NOT HAVING A ZANIES. NOT HAVING A HOME. WE GOT ALL THESE COMEDIANS OF COLOR AND NOWHERE TO REALLY PUT THEM. RAYMOND LAMBERT ALSO RECOGNIZED THE GAP IN THIS MARKET, AND ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS BORN. SFX: ELECTRICITY RAYMOND WAS ABLE TO SAY, HEY THERE'S A BLACK COMMUNITY HERE THAT WANTS ITS OWN. HE SAW THE NEED AND HE MET IT. RAY WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME, AND HE WAS SERVING A NICHE IN CHICAGO THAT NOBODY TOUCHED. THE FACT THAT RAY HAD NEVER OWNED A BUSINESS, HAD NO ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE, NO COMEDY EXPERIENCE, AND NO CLUB EXPERIENCE WAS APPARENTLY NO PROBLEM. NOW ALL HE NEEDED WAS A PARTNER, AND HIS BUDDY JAMES ALEXANDER WAS PERFECT. I HAD BEEN A WAITER IN COLLEGE IN THE RESTAURANT SO I FEL CONFIDENT... HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING EITHER. BUT LIKE RAY, HE HAD AN MBA, AND FROM THE KELLOGG SCHOOL NO LESS. THE WAY THAT I BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ALL JOKES ASIDE IS, I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE LEVY ENTREPRENEURIAL INSTITUTE A THE KELLOGG GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT - NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY. THAT WAS THE THING THAT I LOVED ABOUT WHAT THEY DID, AND THAT IS, THEY TOOK THEIR BUSINESS ACUMEN AND BUSINESS SKILLS AND APPLIED IT TO AN UNDERSERVED MARKET THA HAPPENED TO BE COMEDY. EVEN THOUGH, WE HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, WE THOUGHT WE COULD PULL OFF A COMEDY CLUB, BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST WE NEEDED A NAME. RAYMOND WILL DISAGREE WITH THIS BECAUSE IT WAS A CONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING. I HEARD JAMES USE THE EXPRESSION, ALL JOKES ASIDE. WHEN I SAID ALL JOKES ASIDE HE SAID, THAT'S THE NAME. YEAH HE'S RIGHT; I DID SAY THAT'S THE NAME. TO THIS DAY I SAY THAT I NAMED IT, AND HE SAID THAT HE NAMED IT. SO IN MY MIND, I NAMED THE CLUB... OKAY, ONE OF THEM NAMED THE CLUB. BUT RAYMOND AND JAMES WEREN' READY TO COMMIT TO A PERMANEN LOCATION, SO THEY RENTED AN ART GALLERY, TURNING IT INTO A COMEDY CLUB AT NIGHT. OUR STAGE WAS, BLACK CURTAIN ON SOME KIND OF A ROLLER. IT WASN'T QUITE A HAND WRITTEN SIGN, BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS INEXPENSIVE PRINTING. COMEDIANS COMPLAINED AND JOKED ABOUT THE STAGE. COULD THEY SPENT SOME MONEY ON A REAL STAGE? SO JAMES TURNED TO HIS SISTER LORI, AND HER BOYFRIEND JOEY. WE SPENT ALL DAY FRIDAY CALLING EVERY THEATRICAL SUPPLY COMPANY WE COULD FIND. I MEAN, JUST GOING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES. HAD A STAGE DELIVERED IN A DAY, AND IT'S LIKE WHY DIDN' WE KNOW THIS? WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW. WE DIDN'T HAVE A LIGHTING BOARD SO WHEN IT WAS TIME TO START THE SHOW I WAS ON ONE SIDE WITH ONE PLUG, MY BOYFRIEND IS ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH HIS PLUG AND WE KINDA LOOKED, ONE, TWO, THREE, GO! SFX: ELECTRICITY WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL OUT TO ALL JOKES ASIDE, CHICAGO'S ALL NEW BLACK COMEDY SHOWCASE. THERE WAS NO ALCOHOL. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LIQUOR LICENSE, AND THEY WEREN' FRONTING THAT THEY HAD ONE. JAMIE FOX IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT... THE FIRST DAY, THE FIRS COMEDIAN TO STEP ON THA STAGE, I KNEW IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL THING HAPPENING. ACTUALLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR, UHHH... ACTUALLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS A NICE YOUNG LADY WITH HO-LIKE QUALITIES. WE OBVIOUSLY FELT LIKE I COULD BE SUCCESSFUL, BUT SIX MONTHS INTO OUR PART TIME VENTURE, THE CASH WAS NO FLOWING. IN ANY ENTREPRENEURIAL ENDEAVOR CASH FLOW ISSUES WILL ALWAYS SURFACE. BUT IT WASN'T JUST CASH FLOW PROBLEMS. SFX: METAL DOOR SLAM THEIR CREDIT CARDS WERE MAXED... THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS OVERDRAWN... VENDORS WERE DEMANDING CASH... AND EVEN THE COMICS WERE FEELING THE PINCH. WE BOOKED STEVE HARVEY, AND SO WE'RE HALF WAY DOWNTOWN. I SAID UH, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE A HOTEL FOR YOU. YOU'RE GONNA STAY WITH ME THIS WEEKEND. WHATCHU MEAN WE DON'T HAVE A ROOM? WE DON'T. WE DON'T HAVE A HOTEL ROOM? THIS IS CHICAGO. HE SAID, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, PULL THIS CAR OVER. YOU DON'T WANNA PAY FOR THE ROOM. LET'S JUST GO THERE. THEY GOT A ROOM. HE SAID IF YOU, IF YOU GUYS WEREN'T BLACK I'D TELL YOU TO TAKE ME RIGHT BACK TO O'HARE RIGHT NOW. I WAS WILLING IN THEM DAYS TO DO WHATEVER I HAD TO DO. WE COULDN'T AFFORD A HOTEL ROOM FOR JAMIE FOXX EITHER, BUT WHEN YOU GOT CATS LIKE STEVE AND JAMIE WILLING TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH, YOU BEGIN TO THINK, WE MAY BE ONTO SOMETHING. I MEAN, IT WAS UNINTENTIONAL, BUT EVEN MY BOSS WAS HELPING OUT. I WAS THE ORIGINAL INVESTOR IN ALL JOKES ASIDE, AND I DIDN' EVEN KNOW IT. RAY LAMBERT WOULD BE SITTIN' AT HIS DESK CRYING CAUSE HE WAS LAUGHING SO HARD. I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH STEVE HARVEY, D.L. HUGHLEY, CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER WHILE I WAS PAYING HIM. THAT SHIT FUNNY NOW, BUT I WASN'T FUNNY AT THE TIME. WORKING FULL DAYS IN THE WORLD OF FINANCE, AND THEN MANNING THE NIGHT SHIFT AT THE COMEDY CLUB, WAS TAKING A TOLL ON THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS. SO THE SELF-PROFESSED BRAINS OF THE OPERATION NEEDED SOME BRAUN. ENTER MARY LINDSEY TO HANDLE THE COMEDIANS. I WAS THE ENFORCER. CAUSE I AM TRULY A BAD GUY. I WOULD BE THE PERSON THEY'D SEE, NOT NECESSARILY RAY. MARY'S LIKE, DON'T BOTHER RAYMOND; I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. COME TO MAMA, YOU KNOW, LET'S GO SIT DOWN AND DO THE PAPERWORK. MARY WAS AWFUL. I MEAN SHE WAS HARDER ON ME THAN AN EX-WIFE. I GUESS I LOOK LIKE THE MAN THAT DID HERE WRONG. I DON'T KNOW. SHE WORKS AT A COMEDY CLUB AND SHE'S SERIOUS AS A FUNERAL. WE'VE HAD TWO SHOWS THUS FAR, UM, THEY'VE, THERE ARE PROVING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. MARY GAVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE DIDN'T TAKE NO SHIT, WHICH I LIKE. IF YOU WERE TO GO GOOD COP, BAD COP. RAYMOND WAS GOOD COP, AND MARY WAS BAD COP. SHE'S LIKE HERE'S YOUR CHECK BABY, THANK YOU! NEXT! YOU OUT THE GAME. IT WAS GREAT TO HAVE MARY DEAL WITH THE COMEDIANS. IT GAVE ME TIME TO DEAL WITH THE MANAGERS, AGENTS, AND LAWYERS WHO CAN SUCK ALL THE FUN OUT OF WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GONNA BE A FUN BUSINESS. WITH THIS UNLIKELY TEAM IN PLACE, AND THE COMEDY THING BEGINNING TO GEL, THEY WERE ONLY THREE STEPS AWAY FROM LEAVING THE ART GALLERY AND OPENING A REAL COMEDY CLUB. STEP ONE; GET A BIG TIME INVESTOR. SFX: DRUM ROLL I KNEW MY MOTHER HAD SOME CASH AND I EXPLAINED TO HER WE NEEDED A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SFX: CASH REGISTER STEP TWO WOULD BE A LITTLE TOUGHER. WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEIR DAY JOBS? RAY LAMBERT LEAVING MY FIRM TO GO OUT ON HIS OWN... DUDE, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? WHAT WAS RAYMOND THINKING? WELL, HE WAS THINKING, THA LIKE CHRIS GARDNER, HE WANTED TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT, BU THAT'S OKAY THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, ENTREPRENEURS OFTEN SEE THINGS THAT NO ONE ELSE SEE. ALRIGHT, MY MAMA USE TO CALL IT SEEIN GHOST. BOY, YOU SEEIN THINGS THA NOBODY ELSE IS SEEIN AGAIN AREN'T YOU. I AM SO GLAD THAT CHRIS CAN SEES IT THAT WAY NOW, BUT BACK THEN HE DIDN'T SPEAK TO ME FOR TWO YEARS, BUT TO SEE MY VISION THROUGH, I HAD TO GO FULL TIME. HAD HE STAYED I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO WIND UP FIRING HIS ASS ANYWAY. FOR JAMES AND MARY, LEAVING THEIR FULL TIME JOBS WAS A DIFFERENT STORY. BACK THEN I WAS A SUCCESSFUL FULL-TIME BANKER A CONTINENTAL BANK. I NEVER LEFT MY DAY JOB, SO I WAS A PART-TIME PARTNER. I WAS WORKING FOR CHICAGO BOARD OPTIONS EXCHANGE AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY I'M NO QUITTING MY DAY JOB, BUT WE CAN DO THIS. I'LL HELP YOU. AND STEP THREE... GET A PERMANENT LOCATION. OUR AUDIENCE LOVED OUR TEMPORARY SPACE SO FINDING OUR PERMANENT LOCATION RIGHT NEX DOOR WAS A STROKE OF LUCK. EVERYTHING WAS FALLING INTO PLACE AND ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE MOVE WAS CASTING CHICAGO COMEDIAN GEORGE "THE STRESS RELIEVER" WILLBORN AS HOUSE M.C. I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ME BEING THE HOUSE MC. THAT WASN'T A FORMAT THAT THE WHITE CLUBS, THE MAINSTREAM CLUBS USED WAS LIKE THE HOUSE MC. I WAS THE RINGMASTER OF THIS REALLY, REALLY HOT AND INCREDIBLE CLUB. GEORGE WOULD JUST COME OU HE'D DO HIS SPOT, VERY FUNNY, HE INTRODUCED THE COMEDIANS, HE GOT YOUR CREDITS RIGHT. HE WAS A REALLY GRACIOUS HOST, HE WAS FUNNY HE SET THE ROOM UP NICELY FOR YOU. HE WAS LOVED SO MUCH PEOPLE DIDN'T CARE WHO THE ACT WAS THEY WOULD JUST COME SEE GEORGE. AND THEN PEOPLE STARTING RUMORS ABOUT ME, THERE'S A BUNCH OF RUMORS ABOUT GEORGE WILLBORN. GEORGE WILLBORN USE TO BE A THUG, ALL KIND OF RUMORS. GEOGE WILLBORN USE TO DEAL DRUGS. GEORGE WILLBORN USE TO BE A GANGSTER, HAVE PEOPLE BEAT UP. GEORGE WILLBORN USE TO DO THIS AND THAT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, ALL THAT STUFF, ALL THAT'S TRUE. ALL THAT'S TRUE. I REMEMBER GEORGE AS A THIN, VERY ATTRACTIVE, SUAVE, DARK-SKINNED MAN. UH, WE HAD A LITTLE MOMENT, GEORGE. AND REMEMBER HOW HE USE TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME. GEORGE WILLBURN HAD HALF OF CHICAGO DOING THIS RIGHT HERE. THIS RIGHT HERE. GEORGE WILLBORN COME UP THERE, BE HITTIN' THAT SHIT RIGH THERE, EVERYBODY GOING CRAZY. I WAS BLOWED MAN. TALKING ABOUT, THIS IS WAS WAY THAT THEY DO IT THE PARADES. INSTEAD OF THIS, IT'S THIS. GEORGE WILLBORN BECAME A LOCAL CELEBRITY FROM PERFORMING A ALL JOKES ASIDE. GEORGE WILLBORN, THE HOST OF ALL JOKES ASIDE, HE SHOT HIS SELF. AT THE TIME I CARRIED A GUN ALL THE TIME. I WAS ACTUALLY ON THE PHONE WITH GEORGE AND YOU HEAR, POW! I GOT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. THEY WOULD ALLOW ME TO BRING MY GUN IN. THAT'S A FUNNY GEORGE STORY BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AT ALL JOKES ASIDE. WE DIDN'T ALLOW GUNS. I DONE DID SOME THINGS THAT I AIN'T PROUD OF OKAY? BUT NOW THE NEWEST RUMOR OUT, GEORGE WILLBORN LIVE DOWNTOWN WITH A WHITE WOMEN. NOW HOLD ON NOW. NOW, YOU GOT TO HOLD ON! NOW I AIN'T TRYING TO FINGER NOBODY OUT THERE BUT GEORGE WILLBURN LIVING DOWNTOWN WITH A WHITE WOMEN. HUH, LET ME TELL YOU FROM MY MOUTH. YOU WILL NEVER EVER CATCH GEORGE WILLBURN LIVING DOWNTOWN. WHILE LOCAL MC GEORGE WILLBORN KEPT THEM LAUGHING, IT WOULD BE NATIONAL ACTS LIKE STEVE HARVEY WHO WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT THE GROWTH OF THE CLUB. COUNTRY MUSIC IS BASIC MUSIC JUST LIKE SOUL MUSIC. 'CAUSE COUNTRY PEOPLE AIN' TRYING TO TRIP YOU UP OR NOTHING. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A COUNTRY SONG, YOU RETARDED. WHEN WE BOOKED STEVE HARVEY ON WGCI RADIO, TO PROMOTE OUR CLUB, WE HAD NO IDEA THA WOULD BE ONE OF THE SMARTES MOVES WE'D EVER MAKE. RAY CAME BY MY OFFICE AT WGCI AND TOLD ME ABOUT ALL JOKES ASIDE AND HOW HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO MAKE IT BIG. MARV DYSON IS AN URBAN RADIO PIONEER. IF YOU WANTED TO REACH BLACK CHICAGO, YOU NEEDED MARV DYSON. I HAD WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A GREAT IDEA FOR BOTH OF US. I'D BRING MY COMEDIANS UP TO THE RADIO STATION; PUT THEM ON HIS MORNING SHOW. HE'D GET A FUNNIER SHOW. I'D GET FREE PROMOTION. IT WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL FOR THE BOTH OF US. BUT MARV SAW IT A LITTLE BI DIFFERENTLY. WHY SHOULD WE GIVE YOU FREE EXPOSURE ON THE RADIO? AND AT THAT POINT I TOLD HIM YOU CAN HAVE YOUR COMEDIANS COME UP HERE AND GO ON, BU IT'S GOING TO COST YOU FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. SFX: CASH REGISTER FIVE HUNDRED! BUT THEN I THOUGHT, WGCI IS THE NUMBER ONE RADIO STATION IN THE MARKET. IT'S A NO BRAINER. SO A FEW WEEKS LATER I TAKE STEVE HARVEY OVER TO THE DOUG BANKS MORNING SHOW ON WGCI AND STEVE KILLS. AND THE GREAT THING ABOU STEVE WAS HE WOULD GO AHEAD AND GIVE ALL THE PLUGS ABOU COMING TO ALL JOKES AND HE WOULD BE FUNNY AS COULD BE, BUT HE WOULD ALSO SIT BACK AND HE WOULD OBSERVE. SO AFTER OUR FIVE MINUTES ARE UP DOUG SAYS, "THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING OUT" AND I THOUGH IT WAS OVER, BUT IT WASN' OVER FOR STEVE. WAIT A MINUTE MAN. I DONE GOT UP, FOUR THIRTY IN THE MORNING; PRESSED MY CLOTHES OUT. I DONE SLEPT ON THE COUCH ALL NIGHT LONG. AND YOU GONNA BRING ME HERE TO DO TWO SEGMENTS MAN. Y'ALL MIGHT NOT KNOW WHO I AM, BUT I GOT A REAL GOOD PICTURE OF WHO THE HELL I AM. Y'ALL NEED TO HOLD UP. YOU HAVE NO ONE IN THIS BOTH FUNNIER THAN ME. YOU AIN'T FINA BRING NOBODY IN HERE FUNNIER THAN ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT JOKES YOU TELLING MISTER DJ, BUT THEY NOT THIS MATERIAL RIGHT HERE. HE WAS IN THERE FOR HOURS. STEVE TOOK OVER THE SHOW. I THOUGHT FOR SURE WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE INVITED BACK, BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT BACK TO THE CLUB, THE PHONE WAS RINGING OFF THE HOOK. AND STEVE JUST JUMPED IN AND STARTED TAKING CALLS. YEAH ALL JOKES ASIDE, YEAH I'M TRYING... WHO IS THIS, NO WHO IS THIS? I SAID, HEY MAN THIS IS STEVE HARVEY. THE DUDE ON THE RADIO? YEAH MAN. I WOULD TAKE RESERVATIONS FOR ALL JOKES ASIDE. STEVE WAS SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE WHILE HE WAS ON, AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. SFX: CASH REGISTER ALL YOU NEEDED WAS EITHER ONE PERCENT OR TWO PERCENT OF THA AUDIENCE TO RESPOND AND THEY DID. BECAUSE OF THAT DAY RIGH THERE, THEY INVITED ME BACK SEVERAL TIMES TO SIT IN FOR DOUG BANKS. HEY THIS IS STEVE HARVEY AT WGCI'S CLUB THROW DOWN. THEY GAVE ME A JOB AS THE MORNING DRIVE GUY, WHICH STARTED MY WHOLE RADIO CAREER. STEVE HARVEY HAD LIT THE FUSE AND ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS STARTING TO BLOW UP. RAYMOND HAD INVITED ME TO COME TO THE CLUB JUST TO SEE WHA IT WAS LIKE. I WAS BLOWN AWAY. IT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPERIENCED AT OTHER COMEDY CLUBS THEY WERE SERVING A NICHE THA HADN'T REALLY BEEN SERVED. THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE PREDOMINANT AFRICAN-AMERICAN CLUB. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE IT SERVES THAT NICHE. YOU GO TO A CHINESE RESTAURAN FOR CHINESE FOOD. YOU GO TO A SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT FOR SOUL FOOD. THAT'S HOW WE LOOK AT IT. RAYMOND AND HIS GROUP WERE REALLY TRYING TO LET BLACK PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED. WE DID HAVE A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE, BUT TREATING OUR CUSTOMERS WELL, THAT'S JUS GOOD FOR BUSINESS. ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS THE TYPE OF CLUB THAT LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WALKED IN YOU WERE GOING TO BE TREATED LIKE YOU WERE OUT ON THE TOWN. IT WAS NOT LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT A BLACK CLUB TO BE YOU KNOW. IT WASN'T GHETTO. BECAUSE ANYTIME ANYTHING BLACK EXISTS, EVEN AS A BLACK PERSON, YOU TEND TO THINK THE STEREOTYPE. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WELL RUN, YOU KNOW. IT'S GOING TO BE HALF ASS. I USED TO DO A BIT THA ADDRESSED BLACK BUSINESS. WHY IS THE CEILING FAN ON AND NO BLADES ARE ON THE CEILING FAN? YOU ALWAYS HAD TO CUT THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO GET TO THE BATHROOM, AND THEN THE STAFF ARGUING AMONGST THEMSELVES. I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! BUT BELIEVE ME, THAT WAS NO THE CASE AT ALL JOKES ASIDE. THIS WAS LIKE QUALITY MAN. I MEAN EVERYBODY WORE THE SAME OUTFITS. THEY HAD THE LOGOS. OH YES, WE HAD UNIFORMS. I HAD TO BE NEAT AND CLEAN AND PRESSED. RAYMOND WAS A REAL NEAT FREAK. I ADMIT I'M A LITTLE O.C.D. BUT NO MORE THAN NORMAL, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M HOWARD HUGHES OR SOMETHING. I DON'T THINK. WE EVEN HAD NAIL INSPECTIONS, AND I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THESE WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED RAYMOND'S INSPECTION. MATTER FACT IT WAS ONE OF THE CLEANEST PLACES YOU COULD GO, TO HEAR AND DO COMEDY, AND THE SAFEST. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE CLUB WE ACTUALLY HAD A BATHROOM ATTENDANT. THERE'S A GUY THAT WORKED IN THE BATHROOM MAN; THE GUY HAD ALL THE GOOD STUFF, MAN. HE HAD LIP BALMS. HE HAD LOTIONS FOR YOUR DRY HANDS. THE GUY HAD IT ALL, POTATO CHIPS. OH, MAN I LOVE A CLEAN BATHROOM MAN. THEY SET IT UP NICE. THEY HAD THE PICTURE ON THE WALL, THE PAINTINGS ON THE WALL. IT MADE IT, IT LOOK LIKE A COMEDY MUSEUM. IT WAS KINDA LIKE A COUNTRY CLUB FOR COMEDY. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS THE MOTOWN OF COMEDY. IT ACTUALLY WAS MORE OF A THROWBACK TO WHAT THE COTTON CLUB MY HAVE BEEN. IT WAS A VERY CLASSY ESTABLISHMENT. AND THE AUDIENCE RESPONDED TO THE CLASSY ENVIRONMENT BY SHOWING UP "SUITED & BOOTED". THAT'S THE ONE THING ABOUT A CHICAGO AUDIENCE. THEY DRESS TO IMPRESS. BLACK PEOPLE HONEY, THEY DRESS UP. THEY SHINE WHEN THEY GO OUT. YOU IN CHI-TOWN. THIS IS WHERE THE BROTHERS MUCH HIS GREEN GATORS WITH HIS GREEN SUIT. IT WAS A COMBINATION OF FOLKS. IT WAS THOSE WHO WERE KIND OF CONSERVATIVE STYLE WHO WORKED DOWNTOWN AND THEN IT WAS THE CHICAGOANS, YOU KNOW, WITH THE BIG PLAID WINDOW PANE SUITS, BUT SHARP! I MEAN I REMEMBER WALKING THROUGH THE LINE GOING, DAMN I BETTER BE REALLY FUNNY, THESE PEOPLE LIKE GOT THEIR HAIR DONE! IF YOU CAN AFFORD A MINK COA YOU'RE GONNA WHERE IT ALL YEAR LONG IF YOU CAN. YOU SEE CHINCHILLAS, YOU SEE SOME BEAVERS, YOU SEE SOME FOXES. YOU THINK YOU'RE ON ANIMAL PLANET. IF THINK THAT WHEN A COMEDIAN COMES INTO A CLUB AND HE LOOKS OUT INTO THE AUDIENCE THAT HE HAS AND HE DOESN'T SEE BLUE JEANS AND EVERYBODY IS JUS LIKE SHINNING, IT SORT OF MAKES THE COMEDIAN FEEL LIKE HE NEEDS TO SET HIS GAME UP A LITTLE BIT. SOME OF THE COMEDIANS THAT I DESIGNED CLOTHES FOR WERE CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER, STEVE HARVEY, BERNIE MAC, JONATHAN SLOCUMB. THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE LEVEL OF QUALITY THAT ALL JOKES ASIDE HAD, BECAUSE IF I WAS A BULLSHIT CLUB PEOPLE WOULD OF WORE BULLSHI CLOTHES. BLACK AUDIENCES CAN BE VERY DEMANDING, JUST ASK THE COMICS. BLACK AUDIENCES ARE THE TOUGHEST AUDIENCES 'CAUSE WHITE AUDIENCES APPLAUD EFFORT. WOOOOO! BLACK PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT EFFORT. WE MAD WE PAID TO GET IN YOU FORCED US TO BUY TWO DRINKS, DUDE JUST BOUGHT SOME HO WINGS. HE FOUND OUT TWENTY MINUTES INTO THE SHOW THA THIS DATE HE'S WITH AIN' GONNA GIVE HIM NONE. SO HE'S MAD, AND NOW IT'S ON YOU. AND IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR DRAMA, JUST SIT IN THE FRON ROW OF ALL JOKES ASIDE. IF YOU SAT IN THE FRONT ROW YOU BETTER BE READY TO BE LAUGHED AT, TO BE PICKED ON, TO BE PICKED AT. 'CAUSE BOY IF YOU SAT YOUR ASS IN THE FRONT WITH A BIG OLE PURPLE SUIT ON, BARNEY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BARNEY. GIVE IT UP! HE'S HERE TONIGHT, THANK YOU. A CAT LIKE A D.L. HUGHLEY OR STEVE HARVEY, THEM CATS WOULD MAKE YOU PART OF THE SHOW. HOW YOU DOIN GIRL? SAY YOU GOT ON WHITE PUMPS HUH? PAYLESS PUMPS? YOU COULD PAY MORE, BUT WHY? THE CLUB WAS BECOMING A MECCA FOR BLACK CHICAGO AND ALL KINDS OF FOLKS WERE GETTIN' THEIR LAUGH ON AT ALL JOKES. TYRONE WAS UP IN THERE, POOKIE, RAY RAY. POINT DEXTER CAME. YOU KNOW POINT DEXTER WENT TO MOREHOUSE TOO. IF IT'S A BLACK PERSON WHO WAS A CELEBRITY, THEY MADE I THROUGH ALL JOKES. SO YOU WOULD SEE MICHAEL JORDAN THERE, YOU'D SEE HIS WIFE, THIS IS DURING THE PERIOD WHERE THE BULLS WERE LIKE THE BEATLES OF SPORTS. THE BEARS SHOWED UP, YOU KNOW, RIGHT AFTER THE SUPER BOWL SHUFFLE DANCE, WILLIE GAULT, RICHARD DENT. MIKE SINGLETARY, YOU KNOW, WILBER MARSHALL, YOU KNOW, A BUNCH OF US. YOU KNOW, WE ENJOYED COMEDY. SITTIN' THERE WATCHING CEDRIC AND BERNIE MAC AND STEVE HARVEY AND A LOT OF OTHER GREAT INDIVIDUALS, HOW WE SAY, YOUR FACE JUST HURT FROM JUS LAUGHING. I LOVED HAVING CELEBRITIES COME BY THE CLUB, BUT NOT THE ONES WHO WANTED TO BE COMPED. I HAD A POLICY, SUPPORT BLACK BUSINESS, NO COMPS. WE SPOKE WITH FORMER SECURITIES PERSONALS MARY LINDSEY AND RAYMOND LAMBERT OF ALL JOKES ASIDE. THEY HAVE BEEN LITERALLY LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. WE HAVE MODELED OURSELVES AFTER PEOPLE LIKE BUDD FRIEDMAN OF THE IMPROV BECAUSE THEY TO US ARE THE COMEDY CLUB CHAIN IN THE COUNTRY. COMEDIANS LIKE WORKING FOR A BLACK OWNED, BLACK RUN ESTABLISHMENT WHEN THEY TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. AND WHEN MBA'S RUN A COMEDY CLUB, YOU GET POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, EMPLOYEE HANDBOOKS, AND STAFF MEETINGS. ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS A LITTLE MORE CORPORATE THAN THE OTHER CLUBS THAT I HAD WORKED AT. I'VE GONE TO STAFF MEETINGS, BUT I NEVER WENT TO STAFF MEETINGS AT THE HYATT. RAYMOND, HE COME FROM CORPORATE AMERICA AND SO HE BROUGHT CORPORATE AMERICA TO A HOODLUM ENVIRONMENT. ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS THE ONLY COMEDY CLUB THAT I ACTUALLY WORKED AT WHERE WE HAD A QUARTERLY BUSINESS REVIEW. EVERY MONDAY MORNING I HAD TO PROVIDE RAYMOND WITH A DETAILED REPORT OF DRINK SALES, TICKET SALES, AND INVENTORY. NUMBERS TELL THE STORY. I LOVE NUMBERS. I CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS. WITH CASH BUSINESSES WHA HAPPENED; PEOPLE STEAL YOUR MONEY. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH KNOWING HOW TO MANAGE CASH, THEN YOU'LL GET ROBBED. I HAD TO RUN A TIGHT SHIP AND KEEP MY EYE ON CASHIERS, SERVERS, BARTENDERS, EVERYBODY. BUT I WASN'T ALL BUSINESS ALL THE TIME. AND I ENCOURAGED OUR STAFF TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN TOO, GET TO KNOW THE CUSTOMER, BUT ALWAYS TREAT THE CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT. FOR RAYMOND, THE CUSTOMER'S ALWAYS PARAMOUNT. THE CUSTOMER WAS ALWAYS RIGHT. THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS NUMBER ONE. RAY TOLD THE STAFF THEY COULD BE FRIENDLY TO THE COMEDIANS, BUT NOT TOO FRIENDLY. NEVER GOT TO SLEEP WITH NONE OF THE WAITRESS' SO I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THAT. YOU USUALLY COULD HIT ONE OF 'EM, THERE'S ONE OF THEM THERE'S THAT'S FREAKY. I COULD NEVER FIND THE FREAK. RAYMOND DID NOT ALLOW US TO FRATERNIZE WITH ANY OF THE COMEDIANS, BUT SOME OF THE COMEDIANS TRIED TO FRATERNIZE WITH US. SFX: FOX CALL GEORGE WILLBORN WOULD ALWAYS CRACK ON ME, EITHER IT WAS ON MY HAIR OR ON MY BREAST IN PARTICULAR. RUMOR HAD IT THAT I WAS DOING SOMETHING TO HER. I WAS DOING SOMETHING TO ALL OF THEM THOUGH. FROM THE WAIT STAFF RIGHT DOWN EVERYBODY WHO WAS THERE, I WAS JUST A FAMILY FEEL TO IT. EVERYBODY HAD A GOOD TIME, EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY ON A FIRST NAME BASIS. NOW WITH THE BUSINESS PART OF SHOW BUSINESS UNDER CONTROL, IT WAS TIME TO FOCUS ON THE SHOW PART, SPECIFICALLY THE COMEDIANS. I NAIVELY THOUGHT THA COMEDIANS WERE EASY TO WORK WITH, THEY'RE NOT, THEY'RE DIFFICULT BUT IT HELPS IF YOU KNOW THEIR ACT. RAY LEARNED FAST HOW TO DEAL WITH COMICS AND DEAL WITH COMICS' EGOS. BEFORE I BOOKED ANYONE I STUDIED THEIR REEL. HOURS AND HOURS OF REELS. I WAS TRYING TO LEARN WHA MADE EACH COMEDIAN UNIQUE. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD TO BE FUNNY, BUT DID THEY HAVE A POINT OF VIEW? TAKE LAVELL CRAWFORD OUT OF ST. LOUIS FOR EXAMPLE, I OBSERVED THAT A LOT OF HIS COMEDY IS ROOTED IN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOTHER. I LOVE THAT BIT ABOUT HIS MOM TAKING HIM SHOPPING. WHEN WE GET IN THIS STORE I DON'T WANT YOU TOUCHING SHIT. I DON'T WANT YOU ASKING FOR SHIT. MATTER FACT I WANT YOUR EYES CLOSED, 'CAUSE I DON'T EVEN WANT YOU LOOKING AT SHIT. AND LET ME TELL YOU ONE MORE THING LAVELL MAURICE CRAWFORD. IF YOU GET UP IN THIS STORE AND ACT ANY KIND OF FOOL. AND I DO MEAN ANY KIND OF FOOL. I'M GON KILL ALL THREE OF Y'ALL. STEVE HARVEY TURNED ME ON TO A.J. JAMAL. HE WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICAL COMEDY. THE WAY I EVOLVED FROM MY AC BACK THEN, I WAS HIGH ENERGY, I WAS ALL OVER THE STAGE. WHEN I FIRST STARTED I'D DO THIS PRINCE, MICHAEL JACKSON, JAMES BROWN. I'D TURN AROUND I'D DO THE SPLIT AND JUST SHOOT RIGH BACK UP. AND THEN OVER THE YEARS, I SORT OF CREEPED BACK UP. THEN I WOULD JUST DO THE SPLI AND NEVER GET BACK UP. I'D ROLL OVER AND MAKE IT INTO ANOTHER BIT, AND THEN I COULDN'T EVEN GO DOWN. AND SO OVER THE YEARS MY PRINCE JUST BECAME A LITTLE YOU KNOW, JUST "UHAH!" AND THAT WAS IT. I KNOW A REAL PLAYER WHEN I SEE ONE AND THE YOUNG BILL BELLAMY'S COMEDY REFLECTED HIS PLAYBOY STATUS AND I THOUGH HE COULD BE A REAL HIT WITH THE LADIES. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS WERE GETTING MARRIED WHICH WAS CRAZY TO ME CAUSE I'M ON MTV, I'M LIKE YOU DON'T GET MARRIED RIGHT NOW. YOU BALL OUT 'TILL YOU FALL OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I'VE BEEN TO ABOUT FOUR WEDDINGS THIS YEAR AND IT'S FUNNY TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS GE MARRIED CAUSE GUYS START TO GET REAL NERVOUS THE DAY OF THE WEDDING. THEY START TALKING TO YOU REAL FUNNY SAYING STUFF LIKE, OH MAN, CAN I? CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE? YOU LIKE, WHAT'S WRONG? I AIN'T GONNA SEE YOU NO MORE, MAN. AND YOU THINK THEY'RE PLAYING. MAN, THIS IS IT MAN, IT'S ALL OVER. NAW MAN, WE'LL HANG OUT. SHE SAID, NO WE AIN'T. BELLAMY GAVE ME THE TAPE OF A YOUNG ARIES SPEARS. AND THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO AN IMPRESSIONIST. I HAD ALREADY STARTED COMEDY WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN. EDDIE MURPHY ON SNL WAS KING TO ME. I WAS SO BLOWN AWAY BY HIS ABILITY TO DO IMPRESSIONS. PICTURE ELMER FUDD FUCKIN'. ELMER FUDD WOULD HAVE GOOD TIME CAUSE ELMER FUDD BE LIKE, OH, THIS IS WUOVELY, OH, OH WUOWER, TO THE WUEFT TO THE AH-AH-AH-AH-AH! ANOTHER THING RAY HAD TO LEARN WAS WHICH HOLLYWOOD TALEN MANAGERS TO TRUST. WORTHY PATTERSON WAS A MANAGER HE DID TRUST. WORKING WITH RAY WAS REALLY A FIRST FOR ME. HAVING BEEN A BLACK MANAGER I NEVER REALLY TALKED TO ANY BLACK COMEDY CLUB OWNERS. WORTHY PUSHED ME HARD TO BOOK CARLOS MENCIA, A LATINO COMEDIAN FROM LOS ANGELES, I'M SO GLAD HE DID. I SAID, RAY IF YOU DON'T BOOK CARLOS I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY OTHER ACT. I SAID, TRUST ME THIS GUY WILL DELIVER. SEE I WAS BORN IN HONDURAS; I'M NOT EVEN ACTUALLY MEXICAN. I GREW UP THERE IN EAST L.A. BUT I'M NOT MEXICAN, NOT THA IT REALLY MATTERS ESPECIALLY LIKE PLACES HERE. I'M MEXICAN. I LIVE IN L.A. WHAT ARE YOU? HONDURAN. OH, YOU'RE MEXICAN. AH, I GO TO MIAMI. I'M CUBAN. SEE, WHAT AM I IN NEW YORK? PUERTO RICAN. SEE YOU KNOW ME SHUT UP. PUERTO RICAN, SHUT UP! THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE JOKES THAT LEAD BLACK PEOPLE TO GO, WOW, WE DON'T HAVE THAT. HE'S GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT, THAT'S NOT, WOW. ONE DAY A TAPE ARRIVED AT THE CLUB FROM A COMEDIAN NAMED HONEST JOHN. HE WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALWAYS WORKED FOR ME IS, I WOULD GE UP, I WOULD SAY WELL, THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT AND SUPPORTIN' BLACK COMEDY, AND THE AUDIENCE WOULD GET A KICK OUT OF THAT. HONEST JOHN...HE CAN BE A LITTLE TOO HONEST. I'M A WEED SMOKER. BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE SMOKE WEED DIFFERENT. WHITE FOLKS TAKE A HIT PASS I ON. BROTHER WILL HOLD ON TO THA SHIT TILL TUESDAY. MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT CAME OUT WERE JUST COMING TO ALL JOKES, AND NOT COMING TO SEE ME, AND I SURPRISED THE HELL OUT OF THEM. ANDRE KELLEY WAS ANOTHER COMEDIAN WHO SURPRISED ME. I'M FROM A SMALL TOWN IN KANSAS. WHEN I GOT HERE I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE THE RUDEST FOLKS I EVER MET IN MY LIFE. MY FIRST DAY HERE I WAS TRYING TO BREAK A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL AT THIS CRACKHOUSE AND UM... I FIGURED THEY HAD MONEY YOU KNOW. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET ME IN THE DOOR, THEY ASKED ME FOR I.D., DISRESPECTFUL, RUDE, AND NASTY, THEN I REALIZED I WASN'T A CRACKHOUSE IT WAS JUST DENNY'S. MARY LINDSEY PULLED ME TO THE SIDE BASICALLY ASKED ME TO DO GAY MATERIAL THE SECOND NIGHT, AND I HAD NEVER TALKED ABOU THIS WITH ANYBODY AT THE CLUB. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE KNEW. AND SHE SAID, YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M ASKING YOU? I'M LIKE UH, YEAH. ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS THE ONLY STAGE THAT I CAME OUT AS A BLACK GAY MAN IN CHICAGO. SCREENING TAPES WAS A GOOD WAY TO LEARN ABOUT TALENT FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY, BUT FOR LOCAL ACTS, RAYMOND DEVELOPED OTHER METHODS. I STARTED HAVING LOCAL COMEDIANS DO GUEST SPOTS AND OPEN MIC NIGHTS AT THE CLUB. I FOUND A LOT OF NEW TALEN THAT WAY. DAMON WILLIAMS AND DEON COLE WERE AMONG THE BEST. TV BE RACIST AND EVEN WITH THE POWER RANGERS, YOU KNOW WHA I'M SAYING? IT'S FIVE OF THEM. WHAT THE BLACK GUY GOT ON? BLACK. AND EVERYBODY KICKING THE ALL MONSTER'S BUTTS. AAAH-HAH, AAH-HAH. BUT THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE BLACK PERSON, WHY THEY GOTTA LIKE BUST A SNAKE BEFORE THEY KICK SOMEBODY TEETH OUT? I ACTUALLY MET RAY LAMBER BEFORE I EVEN KNEW HE WAS A COMEDY CLUB OWNER. I USE TO WORK AT THE BOARD OF TRADE. I USE TO SEE RAY IN THE BUILDING ALL THE TIME. I THINK TONY AND I WERE BOTH SHOCKED TO SEE EACH OTHER A MY OPEN MIKE NIGHT, BUT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HIS MATERIAL, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A COMEDIAN. AND DON'T GET ME WRONG I DON' REALLY HATE MY KIDS ENOUGH TO LIKE PUT THEM IN A CAR AND DRIVE THEM TO THE LAKE. LIKE THAT OLE CRAZY WHITE LADY DID. 'CAUSE SEE THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE. BLACK PEOPLE, WE JUST THREATEN TO KILL OUR KIDS, FIVE OR SIX TIMES A DAY. WE BE WANTING TO TAKE THEM TO THE LAKE, BUT OUR CAR MIGH NOT MAKE IT. WE BE IN THE DRIVEWAY LIKE THIS, COME Y'ALL WE BE GETTING READY TO GO, COME ON Y'ALL. GGGGGGUUHHHHGGGGGGGGGUH... DAMN! RAY'S CRASH COURSE IN COMEDY AND COMEDIANS SEEMED TO BE PAYING OFF FOR THE CLUB. ACCORDING TO SOME, HE HAD GREAT COMEDY INSTINCTS. BUT OTHERS FELT HE WAS GETTING TOO SELECTIVE. SOME OF US COULDN'T GET IN IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THERE WERE CERTAIN TYPES OF COMICS THAT IT APPEARED THAT THEY WERE SELECTING. I WOULD CALL RAYMOND AND BE LIKE YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR ME THIS WEEK, HE'S LIKE NAW, NO THIS WEEK MIKE. BUT NEXT WEEK. I WAS TRYING TO GET IN ALL JOKES FOR A LONG TIME LIKE A SLAVE TRYING TO GET FREEDOM. EVERYBODY WANTED IT, AND EVERYBODY DIDN'T GET INTO ALL JOKES. IF YOU CAN GET BOOKED HERE, BE A HEADLINER AT ALL JOKES ASIDE, YOU KNEW THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE CONSIDERED IN THE UPPER ECHELON OF COMEDIANS WORKING AT THAT TIME. RAY LAMBERT HAD STRONG ACTS OPENING FOR STRONG ACTS SO IF YOU WERE CLOSING THE SHOW YOU HAD BETTER BE KINDA OF AMAZING. OVER TIME I GOT REALLY GOOD A PROGRAMMING A NIGHT OF COMEDY. FOR EXAMPLE, SHOULD I PUT A PHYSICAL COMEDIAN WITH AN IMPRESSIONIST OR MAYBE A STORYTELLER? BUT I MADE MY SHARE OF MISTAKES. I REMEMBER ONE TIME I BOOKED HONEST JOHN AND DEON COLE ON THE SAME NIGHT. ONE TIME I CAME IN TO ALL JOKES ASIDE AND UH DEON COLE WAS ON THE SHOW WITH ME. HONEST JOHN COMES IN AND HE'S LIKE YOU SMOKE WEED AND I'M LIKE YEAH. WELL COME, COME ON LET'S, YOU KNOW, I'LL SHOW, I'LL, I'LL GIVE YOU SOME OF MY CALIFORNIA WEED. AND HE ROLLS THIS WEED I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. AT THAT TIME CHICAGO WEED COULD NOT COMPARE TO CALIFORNIA WEED. HE WAS JUST LIKE DON'T, DON' TAKE A LOT OF HITS ON THIS. I TOLD HIM, JUST TAKE A COUPLE HITS. I'M A WEED CONNOISSEUR, I'M LIKE HOW DARE YOU TELL ME HOW TO SMOKE? IS YOU NUTS? I'M SMOKIN' AND SMOKIN'. MAN, BOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER DUDE I JUST LIKE, MY VISION, LIKE, WHAT IS THIS CALLED, PERIPHERAL? IT WAS GONE. MY HEART WAS BEATING. ONLY THING I COULD SEE WAS STRAIGHT AHEAD AND IT WAS GETTING NARROWER AND NARROWER. I'M JUST LIKE OH MY GOD, LIKE, I PROMISE, I PROMISE I WILL NOT SMOKE EVER AGAIN IF YOU JUST LET ME LIVE. I WAS LIKE, I STOPPED BREATHING OR SOMETHING. LIKE, LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO BREATHING, LIKE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO JUST COME. I'M THE REASON HE GAVE UP SMOKING WEED. HAVEN'T SMOKED SINCE. SMOKED ONE TIME, BUT I WAS IN AMSTERDAM, BUT IT'S AMSTERDAM RIGHT? RAY HAD WORKED HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND RESPEC COMEDIANS. AND HE WANTED JUST A LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT BACK. SO HE THOUGHT IMPOSING A FEW SIMPLE RULES ON THEM WOULD BE NO BIG DEAL...RIGHT? YEAH RAYMOND HAD RULES BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE RULES ANYWAY BEING FROM AN IBM BACKGROUND. HE HAD IBM TYPE RULES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE RULES WERE, BUT I COULDN'T ABIDE BY 'EM. YEAH, RAYMOND HAD HIS RULES I SAID LOOK HERE MAN. I GOT OUT THE MILITARY. I DON'T HAVE A SERGEANT NO MORE. RAYMOND LAMBERT HAD A LIST OF RULES, BUT ONE THAT I REMEMBER MOST WAS STICKING WITHIN YOUR TIME. SFX: TICKING CLOCK RAYMOND INSTRUCTED COMEDIANS TO KEEP THEIR ACT WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME. A FLASHING LIGHT AND CLOCK WERE GENTLE REMINDERS. WHEN THAT LIGHT FLASHES YOU BETTER GET YOUR ASS UP OFF THAT STAGE OR WHAT'S YOUR GONNA HAPPEN IS THAT YOUR NO GOING TO GET BOOKED ANYMORE. SFX: METAL HI MARY AND RAY ARE TIME TITANS. DO YOUR TIME GET THE HELL OFF. AM I RIGHT? FIRST TIME I FEATURED AT ALL JOKES, MARY WAS LIKE, YOU WEN FOUR MINUTES OVER. I'M GONNA START CUTTING YOU MOTHERFUCKERS CHECKS. I WAS JUST LIKE, WHAT? YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOU... I'M SORRY. HOWEVER YOU WANT TO WORK IT, IT'S A MONETARY FINE IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THE TIME. THAT'S WHEN THEY'D BE LIKE, SO RAYMOND? AND I WAS LIKE, YOU'LL SEE HIM TOMORROW. IN A COMEDY CLUB EVERYTHING IS BASED ON MANAGING TIME: SEATING CUSTOMERS, SERVING DRINKS, THREE COMEDIANS PER SHOW, THREE SHOWS PER NIGHT. IF ONE COMEDIAN GOES OVER THEIR TIME THE WHOLE NIGH COULD BE RUINED. SFX: EXPLOSION D.L. HUGHLEY AND I DID A SHOW AND I THINK D.L. WENT OVER SLIGHTLY AND RAYMOND ACTUALLY IMPOSED A FINE. UNDER OUR BREATH WE WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS GUY IS CRAZY. OH, AND IT DIDN'T END WITH TIME. RAYMOND'S RULES EXTENDED WELL BEYOND THAT DIMENSION. THEY HAD A LANGUAGE CODE; THEY HAD A DRESS CODE FOR THE COMICS. IF YOU WERE GONNA BE THE HEADLINER YOU'RE EXPECTED TO DRESS NICELY. YEAH, DRESS THE PART. THE OLDER CATS GOT IT. THE YOUNGER CATS, NOT SO MUCH. I HAD SOME GYM SHOES ON AND I WAS TRYING TO GET IN THE CLUB. AND WE HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY TO GEORGE HOUSE TO GET SOME DRESS SHOES. I REMEMBER CHECKING INTO THE HOTEL AND THEM TELLING ME THA YOU HAD TO WEAR A DRESS SHIRT. YOU TALKING ABOUT THE T-SHIR ERA. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A DRESS SHIRT TO COMEDY CLUBS. YOU CAN'T JUST COME HERE WITH YOUR TIMS FLOPPING AND YOUR BIG PANTS. THEY HAD MADE ME GO GET A SUI COAT AND A TIE TO PERFORM. A TIE TO PERFORM? I EVENTUALLY RELAXED THE DRESS CODE, BUT IT I THINK IT SERVED A PURPOSE. IT DEVELOPED A DISCIPLINE IN THOSE OF US THAT WERE THERE THAT YOU CARRIED WITH YOU THROUGH THE REST OF YOUR CAREER. I THINK THAT CLUB MADE A LO OF COMEDIANS GROW UP AND BECOME PROFESSIONAL COMEDIANS. IN A CLUB LIKE THAT WHERE YOU'RE REALLY TRYING HARD TO MAKE A CLEAR IMPRESSION ABOU HOW YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RAISE THE STANDARDS FROM TIME TO TIME. ALL JOKES ASIDE IS A COMEDY CLUB THAT MEANS IT IS A WORKPLACE FOR COMEDIANS. IT'S A PROFESSION. TREAT IT LIKE A PROFESSION. RAYMOND ALSO HAD ANOTHER RULE REGARDING HECKLERS. PART ONE APPLIED TO COMEDIANS. PART TWO, TO THE AUDIENCE. THIS IS GREAT THAT YOU GUYS ARE PART OF IT. THIS IS GREAT THAT YOU WANNA YELL STUFF OUT. WE LOVE THAT, BUT AS SOON AS IT INTERRUPTS THE FLOW OF WHA THE COMICS DOING, YOU GOT TO BE QUIET. THERE WAS A RULE THAT YOU COULDN'T REALLY ATTACK HECKLERS. SOMEBODY MESSES WITH YOU HI HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES AND MOVE ON. HECKLERS ARE THE LOWEST FORM OF LIFE. THEY ARE ONE STEP EVOLVED FROM THE AMOEBA. HECKLERS THINK THEY'RE HELPING YOU, BUT YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME. IT'S LIKE BEING IN BED WITH A MAN, AND HERE'S SOME OTHER GIRL WALKING UP GOIN', I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. IT, IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. I'M READY FOR A HECKLER, IF YOU MESS WITH ME I'LL EMBRASS YOU, AND WHEN ALL FAILS... SECURITY! AT FIRST I WOULD KIND OF APPEAL TO THEM, HEY LOOK BROTHER I'M JUST A SISTER TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, DO MY JOB. THEN I MIGHT GIVE THEM A WARNING. OKAY, YOU GOT ONE MORE TIME BEFORE I START TO TALK ABOU YOU AND BEFORE I TALK ABOU YOU, I'M GOIN' START WITH YOUR MAMA. WOMEN ARE THE WORST. WOMEN ARE THE WORST. ONE WOMAN SAID, YOU GOT BIGGER TITTIES THAN ME. I SAID, WELL YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE ARE NATURAL MA'AM. I SAID THE LAST TIME YOU GO YOUR TITTIES SUCKED THOSE PUPPY DOGS DIED, DIED OF BOTULISM. SO I ALWAYS CARRY A TOWEL TO WIPE MY FACE. A GUY YELLED OUT, HEY MAN WHAT'S THE TOWEL FOR? AND I'M LIKE, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIT AND I HAVE TO STOP TO ADDRESS, AND HE SAID YEAH MAN WHAT'S THE TOWEL FOR? I SAID, TO WIPE THE CUM OFF YOUR MAMA'S BACK. AND THE AUDIENCE LOST IT. HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING AGAIN AND I, AND AS SOON AS I SAID IT, AND I LET THE CROWD DIE DOWN, I SAID, YOUR TURN. NO, NO USUALLY A HECKLER GOES AFTER PEOPLE WHO ARE NO FUNNY. NO, ALL Y'ALL WHO HAD GOOD STORIES ABOUT HECKLERS, THERE YOU GO. I NEVER HAD A HECKLER, CAUSE I'M FUNNY. AN ONGOING CONCERN FOR ALL COMEDIANS IS MONEY. AM I GOING TO GET PAID? WHEN? AND HOW MUCH? WHEN YOU SHAKE THE HAND OF A CLUB OWNER, GENERALLY YOU NEED TO WASH YOUR HANDS RIGH BEHIND IT. HEY MY BROTHER, UH, CAN WE TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE? I KNOW ITS FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN HERE RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND THAT. TICKETS DIDN'T SELL THE WAY WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD. BUT I TOOK A LOSS CAUSE HALF OF THEM WAS COMP TICKETS. UH, SO YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE NO MONEY. HEY LOOK MAN, I'M A GIVE YOU MY WATCH AND LIKE, WHAT? AT ALL JOKES, GETTING PAID WAS NEVER AN ISSUE. WHEN ALL JOKES ASIDE CALLED, YOU KNEW THAT MONEY WAS GUARANTEED. SO EVEN IF THEY HAD TWO PEOPLE OR A THOUSAND PEOPLE, YOU STILL GOT PAID WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO PAY YOU. I NEVER HAD TO THREATEN THEM ABOUT MY MONEY. I NEVER HAD A CHECK BOUNCE. I'D HAD A CAREER OF NO GETTING MY MONEY, BEING LEF AT THE AIRPORT, BUT THE DAY THAT I GOT THERE, FIRST THING RAYMOND SAID, THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOU THAT. AND I DIDN'T. WORD ABOUT RAY'S THRIVING CLUB WAS BEGINNING TO SPREAD. IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE TV CAME SNIFFING AROUND. HEY, HOW YOU DOING? JUST FINE HOW ARE YOU? WELCOME TO ALL JOKES ASIDE. THANK YOU. YOUR NAME? RAYMOND LAMBERT. ARE YOU A COMEDIAN? NOT A COMEDIAN, BUT I KNOW A GOOD ONE WHEN I SEE ONE. YEAH, I DID SOME LOCAL SHOWS LIKE "BEN LOVES CHICAGO" WITH BEN HOLLIS AND "MINORITY BUSINESS REPORT", BU EVENTUALLY COMEDY CENTRAL, A NATIONAL NETWORK, COMMITTED TO A SERIES TAPED FROM OUR CLUB. WELCOME TO COMIC JUSTICE I'M YOUR HOST A.J. JAMAL YOUR LOOKING GOOD, GIVE YOURSELF A HAND. AND ABOUT THAT SOMALIA DEAL. WHY ARE WE GIVING THEM RICE AND GRAIN? KICK SOME GRAIN OUT OF THE AIRPLANE JUST "BHHHHHH". YOU HUNGRY, YOU WANT A SANDWICH, SOME LARGE FRIES, SOMETHING TO DRINK, A SHAKE. KICK ME OUT A HAPPY MEAL! WE GOT A FULL SEASON OUT OF COMIC JUSTICE AND THAT REALLY HELPED SOLIDIFY OUR NATIONAL REPUTATION. B.E.T. ALSO CAME TO OUR CLUB TO FILM TALENT FOR THEIR SERIES COMIC VIEW. DON D.C. CURRY WAS ONE OF OUR REGULARS THAT APPEARED ON THA SHOW. SO THAT'S WHAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY WITH THE MISS AMERICA PAGEANT. A LOT OF THE CONTESTANTS GO TOGETHER, THEY WERE RAISING HELL. SAYING IT OUGHT TO BE BASED ON THE INTELLECT. IT'S BEAUTY CONTEST! NOBODY GIVES A DAMN ABOUT HOW SMART YOU ARE! THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS OF DEF COMEDY JAM: RUSSELL SIMMONS, STAN LATHAN, AND SANDY WERNICK, THEY KEPT A CLOSE EYE ON OUR CLUB. THEY HAD BOB SUMNER AND WORTHY PATTERSON BOOK A LOT OF TALEN FROM ALL JOKES. HALF OF THE CLIENTS WE BOOKED ON DEF JAM HAD PERFORMED A ALL JOKES ASIDE. IT WAS GREAT TO SEE OUR REGULARS LIKE MIKE EPPS DESTROY ON DEF COMEDY JAM. AIN'T NOTHING LIKE BEING IN A FINANCIAL CRUNCH AND HAVING A WHITE FRIEND IN YOUR LIFE. HAVE A NIGGA FRIEND IN YOUR LIFE AND BE IN A FINANCIAL CRUNCH, YOUR BLACK ASS JUST BE IN A CRUNCH. DAMN I'M BROKE NIGGA! YEAH, YOU'LL BORROW MONEY FROM A WHITEBOY AND YOU DON'T NEVER GIVE IT BACK. BILLY RAY YOU GOT TWENTY DOLLARS I CAN BORROW? GODDAMN IT! YOU ALREADY OWE ME EIGHTY, BU HERE ,SHIT. EVENTUALLY RAY GOT TIRED OF HELPING EVERYBODY ELSE MAKE THEIR TV SHOWS, AND DECIDED I WAS TIME TO FUND A SPECIAL OF HIS OWN. IT RAN ON THE LOCAL NBC AFFILIATE. FROM ALL JOKES ASIDE COMEDY CLUB IN DOWNTOWN CHICAGO YOUR HOST GEORGE WALLACE! SFX: TAPE WARPING IT WAS A FINANCIAL DISASTER....AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME I'M EVER GONNA SELF FINANCE A TV SHOW. AND THEN IT HAPPENED. SFX: SCREECHING TRAIN IN PRISON, I BECAME ANGRY, BITTER, HARDCORE. I'M JUST KIDDING. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PRISON. I WASN'T ARRESTED, BUT I WAS VISITED. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. WHEN YOU OPERATE A NIGHTCLUB IN CHICAGO, YOU GET "VISITED" BY ALL KINDS OF UNSAVORY CHARACTERS. NOW RAY'S NOT TALKING ABOU THE AL CAPONES OF THE WORLD. HE'S TALKING ABOUT A FAR MORE CUNNING GROUP OF SHAKEDOWN ARTISTS KNOWN AS THE THREE P'S. NO COMMENT AND ON NONE OF THEM. DON'T ASK ME NO QUESTIONS ABOUT NO PIMPS, POLITICIANS, OR PREACHERS. YA SEE, PIMPS, POLITICIANS AND PREACHERS ARE ALL LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT. THAT'S JUST THE PRICE OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE "WINDY CITY". YA GOTTA SPREAD A LITTLE CASH AROUND. I DIDN'T LIKE IT AND I DIDN' DO IT UNLESS YOU WERE A COP OR SOMETHING. I NEEDED SOME PROTECTION. BUT OVERALL, I LOVE CHICAGO AND OUR COMEDIANS LOVED I TOO. I DON'T THINK ALL JOKES ASIDE COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN ANY OTHER CITY. HELLO CHICAGO! HEY! HELLO CHICAGO! HEY! I LOVE THIS TOWN. THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE TOWN TO DO COMEDY IN, YOU KNOW THAT? AND I'M GOING TO CLEVELAND TOMORROW NIGHT AND I'M GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING WHEN I GET TO CLEVELAND. CHICAGO'S THE BEST CITY IN AMERICA. YOU NEED TO KNOW CHICAGO IF YOU LIVING IN AMERICA. WHETHER IT WAS HER NEIGHBORHOODS, HER FOOD, HER WEATHER, HER WOMEN OR HER POLITICS, ALL JOKES COMEDIANS WERE ENDLESSLY INSPIRED BY CHICAGO. YOU GO TO CHICAGO YOU JUST RUN UP INTO SOME OF THE GREA STUFF ABOUT IT LIKE GOOSE ISLAND SHRIMP MAN. YOU MAKE THAT A GOTTA GO TO. HAROLD'S CHICKEN, YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA GO TO. LEM'S BARBEQUE AND CHICAGO IS KNOWN FOR ITS PIZZA. I WAS WONDERING WHY THEY NEVER COMBINED GARRETT'S POPCORN AND GIORDANO'S PIZZA, MAN. WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST TAKE THE TOP OFF THE PIZZA AND PUT POPCORN INSIDE OF IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND COMBINE THEIR FORCES, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? I WOULD MOVE HERE BUT GOD DAMN IT, IT'S COLD AS FUCK. I REALLY IS MAN, I CAN'T TAKE THE...I CAN'T TAKE THE COLD. I WOULD GET OFF THE PLANE AND MY BALLS WOULD JUST SHRIVEL UP. I WOKE UP ONE MORNING THEY SAID IT WAS TWO. I SAY TWO? WHY EVEN TELL ME, JUST SAY PU ON EVERYTHING YOU GOT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYBODY LIVE IN CHICAGO IN THE WINTER TIME. THAT OUGHT TO BE AGAINST THE LAW. NO, I WAS HIDING FROM THE COLD LIKE IT WAS THE POLICE. I WALK OUTSIDE, DAMN ITS STILL OUT THERE. I AIN'T SEEN THE SUN IN A MONTH. WHO LIVES IN A CITY THAT DON' HAVE A SUN? IT'S SO COLD IN CHICAGO I MAKE ILLEGAL ALIENS TURN THEY SELF INTO IMMIGRATION. I KNOW MY RIGHTS. YOU S'POSED TO DEPORT ME. ALL MY FRUITS ARE FROZEN. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU GO TO CHICAGO NOT ONLY IS THE LIFESTYLE HOT, BUT THE WOMEN ARE INCREDIBLE. GIRLS GALORE. WOMEN, JUST LOVELY AS EVER. YOU'RE SEEING SISTERS THA DRESS TO THE NINES, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. THE NICE HEELS, HAIR DONE. NOT JUST REGULAR GIRLS, BU GIRLS THAT ARE DOING THINGS. PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE THAT GO REALLY COOL JOBS, YOU KNOW THEIR OWN MONEY. THEY DON'T REALLY NEED STUFF. I DO REMEMBER IN CHICAGO WHERE YOU COULD GO AND GET STUFF THAT REALLY HAD NO BUSINESS BEING FOR SALE. VHAT DO YOU VANT? THERE'S THIS GUY OUT FRONT AND HE'S SELLING A TABLE LEG. OKAY? WHO THE HELL NEEDS A TABLE LEG? AND WHY, WHY WOULD YOU WANT A TABLE LEG? BUT THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, HELL WE HAD A FEW TABLES THA DIDN'T HAVE BUT THREE LEGS ON IN. SO WHAT IT DON'T LOOK LIKE THE OTHER LEGS. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE VISITING, LIVING OR WORKING IN CHICAGO. YOU CANNOT COME HERE AND NO BE AFFECTED BY POLITICS. RAYMOND WOULD LEARN THAT THE HARD WAY AND SO DID A YOUNG BARACK OBAMA. BUT FOR COMEDIANS, POLITICS EQUALS MATERIAL. ALL JOKES ASIDE CHICAGO IT IS PROBABLY WHERE I SHAPED MY POLITICAL VOICE KNOWING THAT I WAS A BLUE DOG DEMOCRAT A THAT TIME AND THEN WOULD GO ON TO BE A FULL-FLEDGED REPUBLICAN. MCCAIN WAS HORRIBLE ON THE DEBATE. WASN'T HE HORRIBLE ON THE DEBATE? CAUSE HE, THIS IS WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE WAS OUT BACK BEHIND THE CHAIR TELLING JOKES TO HIS SELF LIKE "RAINMAN" YOU KNOW, STANDING BACK HER. OH, HE WAS IGNENT. I WAS SO HUMILIATED AS A REPUBLICAN, YOU KNOW. SO HE BACK THERE LOOKING CRAZY RIGHT, SO THEN THIS IS HOW COLD BLOODED AND SEXY BARACK OBAMA WAS. WHEN THEY ASK BARACK WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY, I SWEAR FOR GOD WHEN THIS NEGRO STOOD UP VIOLINS STARTED PLAYING, DOVES FLEW OUT. HE LICKED HIS LIPS LIKE LL COOL J. AND HE SAY, THIS GO OUT TO ALL THE LADIES IN THE HOUSE. OH HE FINE, HE FINE, HE FINE. I THOUGHT I KNEW EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING ABOUT CHICAGO COMEDY. I WORKED ON STAGE AT SECOND CITY FOR YEARS WITH SOME OF THE TOP NAMES IN COMEDY. AND YET HERE I AM TOTALLY, TOTALLY UNAWARE THAT TWO MILES AWAY ON THE SOUTH SIDE THERE'S THIS OTHER CLUB CRANKING OU MAJOR COMEDY STARS. TWO CHICAGO'S MAN, EBONY AND IVORY. FOR HALF OF CHICAGO, ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS DESTINED TO REMAIN THE BEST COMEDY CLUB THEY NEVER HEARD OF, BUT THAT HAD ZERO IMPACT ON THE COMEDIANS WHO JUST KEPT POLISHING THEIR ACTS. WITHOUT A DOUBT I'M GONNA TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS THE LABORATORY. WHERE ALL THESE COMEDIANS, THE KINGS AND THE QUEENS OF COMEDY HONED THEIR SKILLS MAN. THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF COMEDY WOULD DO TWO OF THE MOS SUCCESSFUL CONCERT TOURS OF ALL TIMES. AND THE FILMS OF THOSE TOURS WERE SUCCESSES TOO. THE SEEDS WERE PLANTED AT ALL JOKES. THERE WAS A STOCK JOKE THAT I, I BELIEVE I WAS AT ALL JOKES ASIDE WHEN I WROTE IT. AND IT WAS QUITE BY ACCIDEN SOMEBODY YELLING OUT IN THE AUDIENCE ABOUT MY LIPS AND HOW BIG THEY WERE. I KNOW BY NOW Y'ALL NOTICED I'VE GOT SOME BIG ASS LIPS. YEAH, I KNOW THEY SOME BIG MOTHERFUCKERS. SEE, EH, I KNOW THEY SOME BIG MOTHERFUCKERS. YEAH, ALL MY LIPS ARE BIG MOTHERFUCKER. THAT'S RIGHT. SEE, SEE HERE'S THE KIND OF MOTHERFUCKER HOLLERING ABOU BLOWJOB, AND HE WEARING ABOU A SIZE FOUR. LITTLE OLE FEET. SO YOU KNOW HIS DICK SMALL. I COULDN'T GIVE HIM NO BLOWJOB. MY BIG ASS LIPS, HIS LITTLE OLD DICK, IT WOULD WORK. THAT'D BE LIKE TRYING TO GIVE A WHALE A TIC TAC MOTHERFUCKER. THAT SHIT WOULDN'T WORK. IT WOULDN'T WORK. CLASSIC JOKE. I THINK IT JUST PUT ME ON THE MAP AS THE COMEDIAN NATIONALLY. LAURA HAYES, ANOTHER QUEEN OF COMEDY, A GREAT STAND UP AND AN ACCOMPLISHED ACTRESS. HER ACT PLAYS LIKE A ONE WOMEN SHOW ON BROADWAY. WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM MY MOTHER'S THE DISPATCHER. SHE'LL DISPATCH US OU WHENEVER THERE'S A PROBLEM. SHE'LL GET RIGHT ON THE PHONE, LAURA, BERTHA, JULIE RUTHIE GET ON OVER TO ALICE'S HOUSE THAT NIGGA DONE READ "A BLACK MAN'S GUIDE". SO WE JUMP IN THE CAR AND WE ROLLING. AND I GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS RIDING WITH ME GODDAMN IT. WE SLAPPING FIVE OVER THE SEA AND SHIT. GET TO MY BABY SISTER'S HOUSE AND THIS NIGGA IS JUST ABOU TO SWING. I GO, OH NO MOTHERFUCKER, NO TODAY GODDAMMIT, FUCK THAT! ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS THE ONE CLUB WHERE YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT, THAT SEXISM. I EXPERIENCED EQUALITY WITH MY FELLOW MALE COMEDIANS. MO'NIQUE, WHAT A TALENT. SHE WAS A REGULAR AT ALL JOKES ASIDE TOO, BUT DID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A FIFTH QUEEN OF COMEDY? WE HAD HER TOO. I STARTED WITH THE QUEENS OF COMEDY I WAS THE ORIGINAL HOS AT THE BEGINNING I THINK WE DID ABOUT THREE SHOWS BEFORE THEY BROUGHT LAURA IN AND TOOK ME OUT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHEN THEY IN A RELATIONSHIP, THEY ARE SO STUPID. MEN, OH MY GOD. THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY IN A RELATIONSHIP. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL THE WOMEN IN HERE, BUT IF YOU HI THIS TWICE WE GO TOGETHER. WE'S A COUPLE NOW, BOO. BEING A BLACK WOMEN IN COMEDY IS THE HARDEST THING ON EARTH, CAUSE WE ARE HARDER ON ARE WOMEN THAN CHINESE PEOPLE ARE ON DOGS. OH GOD, IT IS ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS IN THE WORLD IS BEING A BLACK FEMALE COMEDIAN. YOU KNOW WHEN THEY SAY WOMEN AREN'T FUNNY, I THINK THEY MEAN MOST WHITE WOMEN AREN' FUNNY. YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE GUESS WHAT MAN, WHITE WOMEN JUST DON'T HAVE IT THA HARD. STEVE HARVEY HAS ALWAYS KNOWN HE WAS A PART OF SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL AND THE ALL JOKES AUDIENCE WITNESSED THE BEGINNING. THE GREATEST RUN EVER WAS ME, THE GORILLA BERNIE MAC, DL, AND CED THE ENTERTAINER. SO I THOUGHT I'D MAKE ME A SANDWICH, HA-HA. WENT TO THE REFRIGERATOR, HA-HA. GOT ME OUT SOME BREAD, HA HA. PUT ON SOME SALAMI, HA-HA. PUT ON SOME CHEESE, HA-HA. GOV'MENT CHEESE, HA-HA-HA. WENT BACK TO THE REFRIGERATOR, HA-HA. LOOKING FOR THE MIRACLE WHIP, HA. WUDN'T NO MIRACLE WHIP, HA. HAD TO PUT EVERYTHING THINK BACK UP. 'CAUSE A SANDWICH, HA-HA-HA. JUST AIN'T A SANDWICH, HA-HA, WITHOUT THE TASTE, HA-HA, OF MIRACLE WHIP. THE DOORS OF THE CHURCH ARE OPEN. I HAD WHAT I CALL A LEGENDARY ALL JOKES ASIDE EXPERIENCE. WE HAD TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS TO THE SHOW ONE NIGHT. I SAID A JOKE, THE PERSON IN FRONT LAUGHING WAS LIKE "AHHHH" AND THE PERSON SITTING BEHIND HIM SAID "AHHHH" AND "BOOM" AND THEIR HEADS HIT. AND IT WAS LIKE THE PARAMEDICS HAD TO COME. I JUST REMEMBER THAT AND I WAS LIKE OH, I'M BUSTING PEOPLE HEADS WITH COMEDY. SFX: AMBULANCE STEVE HARVEY HAD A SIMILAR INCIDENT. A GUY WAS LAUGHING SO HARD HE HAD A HEART ATTACK. BUT THE THING I REMEMBER MOS ABOUT STEVE WAS THE TIME WE SPENT TOGETHER OFFSTAGE, JUS TALKING. RAY WAS A GUY CLOSEST TO ME. YOU KNOW, THE GUY THAT I TALKED TO, WOULD SIT UP AND DISCUSS THE BUSINESS PART OF IT. THE NEXT MOVE, HE WAS A GUY THAT WANTED TO BE A PLAYER IN THE GAME. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT STEVE AND I ARE REFRESHINGLY OLD SCHOOL, AND THAT'S REFLECTED IN HIS COMEDY. SOME OF Y'ALL THINK THAT WE ALL LIKE RAP. I'M THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OLD COULD GIVE A DAMN ABOUT SOME RAP. THE LAST THING I'M GONNA DO IS SPEND MY HARD EARNED MONEY, GO TO A CONCERT, SEE SOME KID WALKING ROUND WITH SOME BIGPANTS ON, AND SOME GYM SHOES UNLACED. SOMEONE SAY PEACE OUT! SOMEONE SAY PEACE SOME MORE! SOMEONE SAY PEACE SOME MORE, MORE! AHHHH! LOOKING BACK AT DL HUGHLEY ON OUR STAGE, HE WAS AMONG THE BEST AT FINDING GREAT COMEDY IN CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. I DON'T KNOW MAN, BLACK PARENTS ARE JUST DIFFEREN FROM WHITE PARENTS, NO BETTER, NO WORSE JUST DIFFERENT. SAW A MOVIE CALLED "POLTERGEIST". IN THE MOVIE A LITTLE WHITE CHILD WAS TRAPPED IN A TV SET AND HER PARENTS STARTED CRYING. "AHHH, CAROL ANNE'S IN THE T.V. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?" YOU KNOW HAD THAT BEEN A BLACK MOTHER SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD. SHE WOULD OF PICKED UP THE PHONE CALLED HER BEST FRIEND, SAID, "GIRL, TURN TO CHANNEL TWO." IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THIS; NO BERNIE MAC, NO ALL JOKES ASIDE. THIS GUY I'M ABOUT TO INTRODUCE IS A RENOWNED COMMENTATOR ALL OVER CHICAGO. THIS GUY HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE. YOU SEEN ARSENAL HALL, JOHNNY CARSON, RICK DEES? HE WATCH 'EM ALL. YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T BE RIGH TO TALK ABOUT ALL JOKES AND NOT TALK ABOUT BERNIE MAC. BERNIE WAS THE GODFATHER OF CHICAGO COMEDY. THE COMEDIAN I ENJOYED MOS WOULD BE BERNIE MAC. UM, HE WAS JUST SPECIAL. BERNIE MAC, WAS JUST, HE WAS JUST, JUST ONE OF MY FAVORITES. BERNIE? MAN, BERNIE EVEN THOSE DAYS YOU COULD TELL BERNIE WAS GOING TO BE VERY, VERY SPECIAL. A GUY WHO COMMANDED HIS SPACE IN TIME. LIKE A MAN WHO WAS SO CONFIDENT, SO HUNGRY, SO FUNNY. WHEN BERNIE GOT THE SUCCESS AND HE LET EVERYBODY KNOW THA HE WOULD WORK THROUGH ALL JOKES. I MEAN, WE MISS HIM BUT THERE WAS NOBODY, NOBODY LIKE BERNIE. I WOULDN'T DARE CHEAT THE AUDIENCE IF I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO GIVE I'M NO COMING. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE MOS IMPORTANT THING IS TO GIVE YOUR BEST AT ALL TIMES. I LEARNED ABOUT PERFORMING AND JUST BEING A MAN FROM THE MAC MAN. BERNIE MAC WAS, YOU KNOW, LIKE A LEVEL YOU WANT TO ASCEND TO AS A COMEDIAN. ME, CED AND D.L. WE STILL HERE, WE KNOW WHAT BERNIE WAS TO US WITHOUT BERNIE NONE OF THIS THING WOULD OF POPPED THE WAY IT DID. BUT WE CAN DO OUR HANDS LIKE THIS IN THE STAND UP BUSINESS AND SAY, FOR YEAR'S MAN, WE WERE WERE AMONGST THE KINGS OFCOMEDY. BY THE MID-NINETIES, ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS BOOMIN'. THEY'D EVEN PAID BACK THEIR BIG TIME INVESTOR. (SFX: CASH REGISTER, METAL HIT) THEY'D ALSO OPENED A SATELLITE CLUB IN THE "MOTOR CITY" AND WERE TALKING ABOU EXPANDING TO D.C. NOW THE CASH WAS REALLY FLOWIN'. THERE WAS A LOT OF IT. IT WAS GREEN. THERE WAS PLENTY. IT WAS FLOWING. I REMEMBER HOW EASILY IT WAS TO SELL TICKETS. HOW EASY IT WAS TO PACK A ROOM. LINES AROUND THE BLOCK. LOBBY FULL OF PEOPLE. I'M TALKING ABOUT DOWN THE BLOCK, AROUND THE CORNER, AROUND THE OTHER CORNER, AND AROUND ANOTHER CORNER. TURNING AWAY A HUNDRED PEOPLE A NIGHT. THIS AIN'T GONNA BE LIKE THIS FOREVER IS IT? I COULDN'T BELIEVE, I'M LIKE A BLACK MAN OWNS THIS CLUB. THE PRINCE OF ALL JOKES ASIDE. THIS IS TOO GOOD FOR THEM. THIS IS TOO GOOD FOR US. SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN. SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING. STORM CLOUDS WERE BEGINNING TO GATHER. (SFX: THUNDER) STORM CLOUD NUMBER ONE, THE WHOLE COMEDY BUSINESS WAS CHANGING. ALL THE GUYS WHO WERE DOING THE CLUBS; HONING THEIR CRAFTS, BECAME STARS. AND THE GUYS WHO BECAME STARS STARTED DOING THEATERS. PEOPLE WANTED TO PLAY CONCERTS AND NOBODY KINDA WANTED TO PLAY COMEDY CLUBS. SO NOW INSTEAD OF ME PLAYING ALL JOKES ASIDE, I WAS DOING THE CHICAGO THEATER SOLD OU FOUR NIGHTS. I WAS DOING THE REGAL THEATER. I WAS DOING PARKWEST. IT'S LIKE A WALMART MOVING IN NEXT TO A MOM AND POP STORE. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE MONEY DOING LESS SHOWS WAS THE MOVE TO MAKE. BUT, WHAT WE DIDN'T REALIZE WAS THAT WE WERE KILLING THE SMALL GUY. I SAW THE MARKET GOING TO THE CHICAGO THEATER. YOU KNOW, I COULD OF SAID, WELL LET'S KEEP ALL JOKES BU MAYBE I'LL DO A SUBSIDIARY UNDER THE ALL JOKES WINDOW THAT GOES AFTER THESE LARGER VENUES. BUT I DIDN'T. BACK THEN I WAS A PURIST. STAND UP COMEDY BELONGED IN THE INTIMACY OF A COMEDY CLUB. I DIDN'T SEE THEATERS AND CONCERT HALLS AS THE RIGH VENUE. MAYBE I DIDN'T WANT TO. RAYMOND AND JAMES WEREN'T THE ONLY OWNERS AFFECTED BY THE CHANGING BUSINESS. ALMOST ALLTHE OTHER CHICAGO STAND UPCLUBS HAD ALREADY CLOSED. IT WASN'T JUST THE BIG VENUES THAT WERE KILLING LITTLE CLUBS, THE GLUT OF STAND UP COMEDY SHOWS ON CABLE TV WASN'T HELPING EITHER. (SFX: THUNDER) STORM CLOUD NUMBER TWO WAS AN EVEN MORE DIRECT THREAT TO THE CLUB. THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS CHANGING. ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS IN CHICAGO'S SOUTH LOOP. BY THE LATE NINETIES, IT WAS UNDERGOING GENTRIFICATION AND THE LANDLORDS WANTED TO CASH IN. SO I WAS LOOKING AT A FIFTY PERCENT HIKE IN RENT. THAT, COUPLED WITH COMEDY CONCERTS, STAND UP ALL OVER TV...IT WAS KILLING ME. MY OLD BUSINESS MODEL WAS NO LONGER VIABLE. THE END OF ALL JOKES ASIDE IS A SERIOUS BLOW TO THE CHICAGO COMEDY COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY, IT ALSO MEANS THERE'S ONE LESS PLACE IN THE CITY TO CALL HOME. IN ONE RESPECT IT LEAVES ZANIES AS CHICAGO'S ONLY FULL TIME COMEDY CLUB. ANY TIME THERE'S LESS, YOU KNOW, ONE LESS CLUB THERE'S GONNA BE ONE LESS OPPORTUNITY FOR A COMEDIAN TO WORK ON THEIR MATERIAL. CO-OWNER RAY LAMBERT SAYS THA THIS LAST WEEKEND WON'T BE CAUSE FOR TEARS. LET'S ENJOY WHAT WE HAD AND CALL IT A DAY. THAT AUGUST, IN 1998, RAYMOND SHUTTERED ALL JOKES ASIDE. BUT THAT ISN'T THE END OF OUR STORY. WITH MARY LONG GONE AND JAMES ACCEPTING A BUYOUT, RAYMOND HAD DECIDED TO GO I ALONE AND OPEN A NEW CLUB ON THE NORTH SIDE. BUT NOT EVERYONE ENDORSED HIS PLAN. SO NOW LET'S GO, LET'S GO ON THE WHITE SIDE. THAT'S WHAT IT KIND OF FEL LIKE. AND IT WAS LIKE, NAW, LET'S KEEP IT BLACK. ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS OUR COMEDY CLUB. FOR BLACK PEOPLE, FOR BLACK ARTISTS, FOR BLACK SOCIAL CIRCUIT, YOU KNOW. IT WAS, IT WAS OURS. THERE WAS A SPIRIT OF BLACK COMEDY THAT EXISTED IN ALL JOKES ASIDE, AND I THINK SOME OF THAT IS LOST WHEN YOU UPGRADE, QUOTE UNQUOTE, UPGRADE. THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT HOLDING ON TO WHA YOU'VE GOT AS OPPOSED TO EXPANDING. SO, BUT THAT HAPPENS WITH ENTREPRENEURS. LOOK, CLOSING IN THE SOUTH LOOP WAS HEARTBREAKING, BU THE CLUB WASN'T GONNA SURVIVE THERE. BY MOVING MY CLUB JUS A MILE AND A HALF NORTH TO THE MAINSTREAM ENTERTAINMEN DISTRICT, I COULD REPLACE SOME OF THE AUDIENCE I WAS LOSING WITH COMEDY FANS OF ALL RACES. I COULD NOT ONLY SAVE MY BUSINESS, I COULD GROW IT. RAY SECURED THE PERFEC LOCATION FOR HIS DREAM. IT WAS A BUILDING IN NEED OF A MAKEOVER IN THE AFFLUEN FORTY-SECOND WARD. BUT FIRST, HE WANTED THE BLESSING OF THE LEGENDARY POLITICAL FIGURE WHO RAN THE WARD. I THINK LEWIS BLACK IS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS, AND I HAS NOTHING TO DO, UH, WITH THE FACT THAT HE'S JEWISH AND I'M JEWISH. I JUST THINK HE'S JUST DAMN FUNNY. THE BOMBASTIC BURT NATARAS IS AN ICON, AN OLD SCHOOL CHICAGO POLITICIAN AND WHO KNEW...AN OPINIONATED COMEDY FAN. WELL BILL COSBY ISN'T AS FUNNY AS CHRIS ROCK. UH, BILL COSBY IS SORT OF SUBTLE, YOU KNOW. MY FIRST MEETING WITH ALDERMAN NATARUS COULDN'T HAVE GONE BETTER. I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT MY CLUB WOULD BE WELCOMED IN HIS WARD. I THINK, UH, AN AFRO-AMERICAN CLUB CAN GO ANYWHERE. IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE DEMEANOR OF THE PEOPLE. WELL IF IT WAS GONNA BE ABOU THE DEMEANOR OF THE PEOPLE, NO PROBLEM. IN EIGHT YEARS OF OPERATION A ALL JOKES ASIDE, WE NEVER HAD ONE INCIDENT SO I SIGNED THE LEASE ON THE SPACE AND HIRED ONE OF THE CITY'S HOTTES YOUNG ARCHITECTS. HELLO EVERYONE, MY NAME IS OBI NWAZOTA. UH, I AM AN ARCHITECT. RAISED IN NIGERIA. TRAINED IN LONDON. AND HE'S A LITTLE O.C.D. WE GOT ALONG GREAT. THE BRIEF IS TO DESIGN A COMEDY CLUB. EVERYONE HAD A VISION. WE HAD TO, YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT HOW TO CLEAN IT UP. THE POINT OF EGRESS WAS COMPLETELY SEPARATED. INTERACTIVITY. ACTUALLY BRINGING THE FIRS BAR AREA INTO YOUR PRIMARY LOUNGE. I THINK IT WAS JUST GOING TO THE NEXT LEVEL BEYOND WHAT WE HAD BEEN DOING OR WHAT ALL JOKES ASIDE HAD BEEN. WHAT OBI AND I WERE TRYING TO CREATE WAS NOT JUST A CLUB, BUT AN ENTERTAINMENT VENUE. A PLACE FOR COMEDY, COCKTAILS, AND CONVERSATION. RAY APPROACHED US AND SAID HE'S GONNA OPEN A CLUB ON THE NORTH SIDE, UP NORTH AND, UH, HE WANTED US TO DO THE FOOD. WE AGREED, NOW WE A CAME NUMEROUS TIMES TO CHECK OU THE, UH, CONSTRUCTION AND THE PROGRESS OF THE CLUB. AND THE PROGRESS WAS GOOD. PLANS HAD BEEN APPROVED. PERMITS HAD BEEN ISSUED. AND CONSTRUCTION WAS UNDERWAY. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG? SFX: METAL HI I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD THAT MY NEW NEIGHBORS, THE OWNERS OF THE ART GALLERIES AND ANTIQUE SHOPS, WERE GOING TO FILE A PETITION TO KEEP ME FROM GETTING MY LIQUOR LICENSE. I CAN'T EXIST WITHOUT A LIQUOR LICENSE. I HAD MET WITH MANY OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY. I THOUGHT THEY LIKED ME. EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND RIGHT? SO I WENT TO GET ADVICE FROM MY ALDERMAN. GEEZ, I HATE TO PLEAD IGNORANCE... I SOON REALIZED THAT THERE WASN'T MUCH THAT ALDERMAN NATURUS COULD DO TO SWAY THE PETITIONERS. I HEARD THEY HAD A MEETING. NOW I WASN'T INVITED, BUT I'LL BET IT WENT DOWN SOMETHING LIKE THIS. LOOK LYLE, I DON'T THINK I'M A BIGOT. LYLE DIDN'T SAY THAT MARK. AND I DON'T THINK I'M A MAN OF PREJUDICES. I DON'T BOTHER THEM AND THEY DON'T BOTHER ME. I HERE STORIES. WHAT KIND OF STORIES. TROUBLE, THAT'S ALL. OH, WE'RE ALL GOING TO LOSE OUR JOBS. JUST WHAT IS IT WE'RE AFRAID OF OR ARE MAYBE WE RAISING PROBLEMS TO HIDE OUR OWN PREJUDICES? WELL, WHATEVER THEIR PROBLEMS WERE, THIS WAS GONNA HAVE TO PLAY ITSELF OUT IN COURT, AND QUICKLY I HOPED. BUT MY SEASONED RESTAURAN GUYS THOUGHT THAT HEY, MAYBE THEY COULD INTERVENE AND HAVE SOME INFLUENCE. WE SPOKE TO SOME PEOPLE THA REPRESENTED THE ALDERMEN A THE TIME. HE SAID, THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF THE CLIENTELE IS NO CONDUCIVE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I SAID, SO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SAY IS YOU DON' WANT ANY BLACK PEOPLE. (SFX: METAL HIT) (SFX: THUNDER) STORM CLOUD NUMBER THREE HAD OFFICIALLY REARED ITS UGLY HEAD. THERE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY PROBLEM WITH RAY'S REQUEST FOR A LIQUOR LICENSE. THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT, ZONED FOR COMMERCIAL USE. AND FOR EIGHT YEARS, AT HIS OLD CLUB, RAY HAD AN IMPECCABLE LICENSE HISTORY. BUT THE PETITIONERS ARGUED THAT RAY'S NEW CLUB WOULD QUOTE "CHANGE THE TONE OF THE BLOCK," "CHANGE THE AMBIANCE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD," "CULTURALLY THREATEN THEIR ENCLAVE," AND "HAVE A DELETERIOUS IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY." (SFX: METAL HIT) IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD THERE'S AN ADULT BOOKSTORE, THERE WAS A PORN SHOP, THERE'S THE CLUB WITH, AH, YOU KNOW, FEMALE IMPERSONATORS. MAYBE IF I'D OPENED AN X-RATED COMEDY CLUB I'D BE MORE WELCOME. SO I WASN'T GOING DOWN WITHOU A FIGHT. I MEAN, I GOT ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED AT THIS POINT. SO, I HAD SOME OPTIONS. I COULD HIRE A LAWYER. GO GANGSTA ON THEY ASS. OR AS SOME OF MY MORE RADICAL FRIENDS SUGGESTED, TAKE IT TO THE STREETS. WE GONNA WALK ON THIS RACIS POWER STRUCTURE AND WE GONNA SAY TO THE WHOLE DAMNED GOVERNMENT, STICK'EM UP MUTHAFUCKA! THIS IS A HOLD UP! WE COME FOR WHAT'S OURS! I HIRED A LAWYER, BUT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PANTHERS, I TRIED TO CONTACT CONTROVERSIAL ALDERWOMAN DOROTHY TILLMAN. I KNEW SHE WAS A BIG FAN OF MY CLUB. LET ME TELL YOU, I DON'T CARE HOW I FELT, WHAT WAS GOING ON, GO TO ALL JOKES ASIDE AND SI AND JUST LAUGH UNTIL YOUR SIDE BURST. I HEARD THAT SHE WAS DEVELOPING A MAJOR, WELL-FUNDED ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT IN HER SOUTH SIDE WARD. AND IF EVER A WARD NEEDED DEVELOPMENT, IT WAS TILLMAN'S FORTY-SEVENTH AND BRONZEVILLE. IF RAY LOST HIS NORTH SIDE BATTLE WITH THE PETITIONERS, MAYBE THERE'D BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM IN THE SOUTH SIDE WITH TILLMAN. BUT RAYMOND WASN'T THE ONLY CHICAGO COMEDY INSTITUTION EYEING THAT BRONZEVILLE OPPORTUNITY. THE RENOWNED SECOND CITY, A SKETCH COMEDY THEATER ON THE NORTH SIDE, WAS ALSO REACHING OUT TO ALDERMAN TILLMAN. ANDREW ALEXANDER CAME TO ME AND SAID, LET'S BUILD A BLACK SECOND CITY. SO WE GOT IN TOUCH WITH ALDERMAN DOROTHY TILLMAN WHO IS AN AMAZING CLASSIC CHICAGO CHARACTER. SOME PEOPLE SAY WHY YOU WAN TO BRING SECOND CITY TO FORTY-SEVENTH STREET. I SAID, MR. ALEXANDER WAS A GREAT MAN. HE'S FROM CANADA. HE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR BUT ALSO HE HAVE GREA UNDERSTANDING, A GREA BUSINESSMAN. I HAD TO REALLY EXPLAIN WHA THEY WERE GOING TO BE DOING, HOW GOOD IT REALLY WAS GOING TO BE FOR FORTY-SEVENTH STREET. SO ONE MORNING I OPENED THE PAPER AND I IMMEDIATELY REALIZED WHY I WAS HAVING SO MUCH TROUBLE GETTING IN TOUCH WITH ALDERMAN TILLMAN. SHE HAD PLEDGED HER ALLEGIANCE TO SECOND CITY. NOTHING AGAINST SECOND CITY. THEY'RE GREAT. I'VE WORKED WITH THEM. AS A BUSINESSMAN I UNDERSTOOD IT. AS A BLACK MAN...LET'S JUS SAY I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED. NOW RAYMOND HAD TO PUT THE BRONZEVILLE DISAPPOINTMEN BEHIND HIM AND DEVOTE HIS ENERGY TO FIGHTING FOR HIS NORTH SIDE CLUB. THE COURT BATTLE DRAGGED ON MONTH AFTER MONTH, COSTING HIM MORE AND MORE AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE PETITIONERS WANTED. I THINK IT WAS JUNE OF 2000 I GOT THE CALL FROM MY LAWYER THAT THE VERDICT WAS IN. I WASN'T OPTIMISTIC, BUT TO MY SURPRISE, I WON. (SFX: CROWD CHEERING) HOLD ON. (SFX: TAPE WARPING) THERE'S NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION. AFTER TWO YEARS OF FIGHTING I HAD RUN OUT OF TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY. (SFX: CASH REGISTER) AND YOU KNOW WHAT HURT THE MOST? TWENTY-FIVE GRAND OF THAT, WAS MONEY FROM MY FATHER THAT HAD TAKEN HIM A LIFETIME TO EARN. SO HERE'S THE KICKER ABOUT A YEAR LATER A WHITE OWNED CLUB OPENED UP IN THE SAME SPACE, GOT TO USE THE ELECTRICAL AND THE PLUMBING THAT RAY'S MONEY PAID FOR, AND, AH, I HEARD THEY DIDN'T LAST FOR VERY LONG ABOUT A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEY HAD SOME KIND OF ISSUES. IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE AN IDEA DIE OF ITS OWN WEIGHT, BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING ALL TOGETHER WHEN AN IDEA IS NO GIVEN A CHANCE. IRONICALLY, SECOND CITY'S SOUTH SIDE VENTURE NEVER MATERIALIZED EITHER. CHICAGO HAD LOST OUT ON TWO UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES. THERE'LL NEVER BE ANOTHER ALL JOKES ASIDE. IT WAS, IT WAS THE CLUB. HOT STAGE. HOT CROWD. HOT SHOWS. RAY PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT YOU KNOW. WE AH, WE WERE RIGH BEHIND HIM. I KNEW ABOUT, UM, CHICAGO POLITICS AS BEING ONE OF THE ROUGHEST, SO AS FOR ALL GOOD BLACK MEN I GIVE HIM THIS, MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD A DREAM TOO. FOR HIM TO FACE THAT KIND OF RESISTANCE IS HYPOCRITICAL AND RIDICULOUS. CHICAGO HAS A LONG AND PROUD HISTORY OF BEING RACIST. AND I'M NOT, THAT'S NOT ME MAKING THIS UP OR COMING TO SOME GRAND CONCLUSION. I DON'T THINK THE BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THAT AREA REALLY HAD ANY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS COMING THEIR WAY. WHEN YOU CARE AND LOVE SOMEONE YOU WANT TO PROTECT THEM SO OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, WE ALL WANTED TO CONFRONT THOSE PEOPLE AND SAY, IT JUST WASN' FAIR WHAT THEY DID TO RAYMOND. RACIAL ISSUES ARE ALWAYS GOING TO SURFACE FOR BLACK ENTREPRENEURS IN AMERICA. AND THE BLACK ENTREPRENEUR WHO IGNORES IT IS THE BLACK ENTREPRENEUR WHO WILL PAY A PRICE DOWN THE ROAD UNFORTUNATELY. I FIRST MET RAY BACK IN 1992 THROUGH MY PRODUCING PARTNER AT THE TIME BOB ZMUDA. BOB AND I HAD BEEN DOING A SERIES OF CHARITY EVENTS FOR COMIC RELIEF AT RAY'S CLUB. UH, I RAN INTO HIM AGAIN IN THE YEAR 2000, RIGHT AFTER ALL THIS STUFF HAPPENED TO HIM. AND WHEN HE EXPLAINED THE DETAILS I WAS LIKE, WOW RAY, UH, YOU JUST DIDN'T PAY OFF THE RIGHT PEOPLE. BUT YOU KNOW, THAT'S NO REALLY WHO RAY IS. HE'S NOT FROM CHICAGO. IN COMEDY, TIMING IS EVERYTHING. I THOUGHT THE NEW ALL JOKES ASIDE WAS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAD COME. AND SADLY THERE'S NOT ONE BLACK OWNED VENUE IN CHICAGO'S ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TODAY. RAYMOND WAS LEFT BROKEN AND DEEP IN DEBT WHEN HIS ALL JOKES NORTH DREAM DIED. IT TOOK HIM A WHILE TO GE OVER HIS LOSS. STARTING A FAMILY HELPED CHANGE HIS FOCUS. OBVIOUSLY OUR DAUGHTERS WEREN'T BORN AT THAT TIME, BU WHEN THEY ASK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HOW DID THIS ALL HAPPEN. I'LL TELL THEM THEIR FATHER IS AN INCREDIBLY STRONG MAN AND YOU CAN LEARN FROM THIS THA YOUR DAD, HE HAD SOME HIGHS, SOME LOWS BUT HE'S ALWAYS BOUNCED BACK. SO I'M REALLY PROUD OF HIM TO SEE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW. YOU DON'T GET OVER AN INJUSTICE LIKE THAT, BUT YOU CAN'T CARRY AROUND ALL THA ANGER EITHER. SO WHEN I LOOK BACK ON IT NOW, I FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE. I'M REALLY PROUD OF ALL THE YOUNG COMEDIANS THAT CAME THROUGH OUR CLUB AND WENT ON TO DO GREAT THINGS. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC RAYMOND IS OFTEN ASKED, WOULD HE TRY TO OPEN ANOTHER ALL JOKES ASIDE? WELL, WOULD YOU RAYMOND? YOU NEVER KNOW. IT'S A FUNNY BUSINESS. IF HE HAD A THREE HUNDRED SEA URBAN CLUB ON THE NORTH SIDE OF CHICAGO WOULD IT WORK? IT WOULD BE EASIER TODAY THAN IT WAS MAYBE TWENTY YEARS AGO, BUT HE WOULD STILL FACE SOME UNFORTUNATELY SOME CHALLENGES. I THINK ALL JOKES ASIDE CAN OPEN IN THAT GENERAL MARKE AND NEIGHBORHOOD NOW. I THINK IN TODAY'S SOCIETY RAYMOND WOULDN'T BOOK AN ALL BLACK CLUB. I THINK RAYMOND WOULD BOOK A GREAT COMEDY CLUB. IF ALL JOKES ASIDE OPENED ITS DOORS TODAY THE BUZZ ALL AROUND THIS COMMUNITY WOULD BE, WHOAH. DUDE. THEY'RE BACK. A CLUB LIKE ALL JOKES ASIDE ABSOLUTELY COULD EXIST AGAIN. AS LONG AS IT'S RUN BY RAYMOND LAMBERT. IF ALL JOKES ASIDE WERE TO COME BACK I'M SURE A LOT OF THE GUYS THAT WOULD COME BACK AND PAY TRIBUTE OR HOMAGE TO RAY. IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO ALL JOKES ASIDE, STRAIGHT UP. OH, I DEFINITELY THINK I WOULD, IT WOULD BE FABULOUS TO HAVE IT BACK. RAYMOND, IF YOU'RE OUT THERE, THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THE ALL JOKES CREW, IT WAS AWESOME AND IF YOU COME BACK I HAVE A NEW FEE NOW SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT. BUT UM, YEAH... MUSIC END CREDITS MUSIC END CREDITS MUSIC END CREDITS MUSIC END CREDITS
