Where are the sirens? [Electronic beeping] Collect Sean Michaels. [Demon roaring] No! [Screams] [Demon shrieks] [Haunting piano music] # # [wind chimes ringing] Sean? [Papers rustling] Where are you? You left me hanging here. [Sobbing] Oh, my baby. Helen? Helen? You were sleepwalking again. Why didn't you wake me up when we got here? I wanted to let you rest. But you said. The kids have been a big help. We've got most everything packed already. I'm gonna go check on the kids. Pete, you want to... you want to take a break? I just want to get... just get it over with. Are we separating Grandpa's stuff from Sean's? That would be nice. Can I get you something to drink? Not right now, Mom. Thanks, though. You can, um, you can stay at home tonight if you don't want to drive back to campus. That's all right. Why don't we just get rid of all this... shit. [Footsteps] That's how I want to remember him, you know, before he moved into this house, and... Katie, I think that you should know that the... the coroner and the police agreed that it was self-inflicted, but I... What'd you expect? I mean, he was supposed to be fixing this house up. And there's black paint everywhere, and the mirrors are broken, and the furniture is... But there has to be a better explanation. He was not suicidal. Can we just change the subject? Sorry. You haven't talked to your friends in a really long time. When's the last time you talked to Jeanette? She tried to relate by talking to me about her dead cat. You could try meeting new kids at school. How about that? You know, you could go to a club. You could do drama club. Join the theater. You know, Sean loved the theater. [Tense music] # # [sparks crackling] Fuck, Sean. Pete? [Water running] [Coughs] [Knock at door] Are you okay? Uh, yeah. I'm... I'm fine. Just... just a little sick to my stomach. Uh, Mom? Can I talk to you about something? Let's talk when you come out of the bathroom. Never mind. We don't have to sell the house. I mean, we've always managed before. It would've fixed up real nice, just the way Sean wanted it. [School bell rings] Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools their way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle. Life is but a walking shadow. You know he's going to get lead. I wouldn't mind starring with him. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Scene. [Applause] Whoo! Kathryn? [Girls giggling] Kathryn Michaels? My name is Kate Michaels, and I will be doing a piece that I wrote. Is that all right? Proceed. Dear God, I heard that you can see into people's hearts, and I wonder what you find, because everybody I know wears the same face. They carve their thoughts into bite-size pieces and hack their emotions down to a manageable size till their words are dulled to travel down their tongues. I would ask you to shatter their grotesque masks and let me see what's within. But I fear finding nothing, that my thoughts would choke them, and my feelings crush them, and my words slice their tongues. So you remain quiet, and I'll pretend that they' re hiding. You remain quiet, and I'll pretend that you' re there. Scene. Awesome. Ooh, thank you so much. Okay, bye. [Clears throat] Bless us, O Lord, for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from your bounty through Christ our Lord, amen. Amen. So who was on the phone? That was Miss Bliss. Who? Miss Bliss, my theater teacher. She said that all the other girls were more experienced. [Clears throat] I'll get them. But she's giving me the leading role. Really? Yeah. That's fantastic. What for? [Scoffs] The winter play, Dad. Well, I want to hear more, but I have something that we need to talk about. I found something disturbing at Sean's grave today. What? [Crows cawing] A dead raven nailed to the ground next to his headstone. And there was this... this woman. What was she doing? I don't know. Exactly. Mom's in denial about Sean's suicide. Sean was a mess before he died, completely paranoid and delusional. He wired pipe bombs in his closet. Why? I think to protect his notebooks. Have you seen them? [Tree branches creaking] [Dog howling] I don't know. This is really... This is just... This house is... I don't know either. Look at this. What is this? Bankruptcy, wedding ads, mattress sale, wholesale factory outlet, tampon ads, used cars. Planned betrayal? " Cover the reflections, any reflections. " " He comes for us. What? " Black paint... Worked. " You' re going to stay? Do I need to stop at the store? No, there's things in the freezer. Okay. Drive careful. I love ya. Let's go. [Clocks ticking] [Peaceful piano music] # # [faint screaming] [Alarms ringing] [Screams] [Ringing continues] [Haunting moaning] [Ringing continues] [Film hissing] [Water running] [Projector clicking] [Glass shatters] [Faint screaming] [Gasps] [Knife clatters] [Screams] [Shushes] I heard somebody moving around. Oh, sorry. What are you doing up? Are you all right? [Sighs] I was sleepwalking again. If you resist me, you may find the church against you. They could hang you! Sorry? Your line. "They could hang you for your infidelity. " I just thought that... You' re supposed to resist him. Did you listen to his last line? I just was hoping that... actually, I'm... I got... Maybe you should read the script. I can't watch. She only got the part because, you know, her brother... [grunts] [Screams] They don't know what they' re talking about. You didn't get that part because of your brother. Thanks. I just thought you should know. Why do you think I got the part? Probably... because she left it up to me. Stop messing around. You don't believe me? No, I'm not gullible. Well... I'm not a liar. [Suspenseful music] # # [haunting music] # # I'm so sorry. Don't be. Where do you think she is? I don't know. Want to use my phone? Yeah. [Phone rings] Shit. Hello? [Sighs] Kathryn? [Theatrical music plays over speakers] [Objects clattering] Hello? [Yells] Mom? [Screams] [Groaning] [Gasps] [Screams] [Demon roaring] [Percussive music] # # [yells] [People screaming] Father? Father? Yes? I didn't know who else to talk to about this. Denial is a natural form of coping. The church believes that Satan meddles through the acts of men, not through monsters. It's a waking nightmare. I actually saw a demon when that child took his life. Helen. God will shepherd you through this. Thank you. [Door clicks shut] To mourn this tragic loss. Whenever the Lord calls one of his flock up to him, it's good to take a moment to reflect on the happy memories you had together. Close your eyes. No one has to speak, but now is the time to share your memories about Todd. It could be about his laugh, his smile, his baby blues. [Teeth gnashing] What are you doing? [Hisses] [Dramatic orchestral music] # # [panting] [Footsteps fading] Sean's notebooks? The other side... [church bells ringing] Helen Michaels saw him collect your boy. How unfortunate. Obituaries. [Phone rings] [Line trilling] Hello? Oh, I'm... I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey. I'll be home pretty soon, okay? I just wanted to tell you that it was a good idea, getting involved at school, I mean. Tell her I booked my flight. Dad got his business tickets. Oh, good, okay. Um, can we talk about this when I get home? Yeah. I love you. You too. I'll be home soon. Well, have a good... have a good night. Bye. Sorry I have to miss your opening night. It's not that. " Cover the mirrors. Not enough. " [Screams] "10:28." [Glass shattering] " Reflections. Any reflections. " " Black paint. " "Worked. Cover everything. The Collector comes for us. " " Must protect. " Must protect... Must protect who? Oh, my God. [Demon howling] He was covering the reflections to keep him out. Oh, shit. [Paint buckets sloshing] [Tires squeal] [Grunts] Cover the mirrors. Cover the mirrors. Oh. Black paint. [Groaning] [Gasps] [Sobbing] [Sobbing and laughing] [Whimpering] [Buttons beeping] [Demon hissing] Pacific Daylight Time will be 10:28 and 30 seconds. Beep! [Groans] [Demon howling] [Gasping] Helen, what is... Get out of my way! What the hell is going on here? [Yelps] Mom! [Glass shatters] [Screams] Call 911. Call 911! I got him. I got him. I got him. I stopped him from coming in. [Sighs] Charlie? Hey, I'm here. Peter came down to see you, left you some flowers. How are you feeling? Where's Kathryn? She's at play rehearsal. We have been so worried. At play rehearsal? Yeah, we have been so worried about you. No, Charlie, we got to get her out of there. - No, no, no. - No. Mrs. Bliss. You've got to lie down. Mrs. Bliss, she's a part of it. No, no. You have got to lie down. No. Look, we have got to talk about what you think you saw in the mirror. What I saw in the mirror? Yes. You didn't see it? See what? You didn't see him? It was... See who? The Collector. - What? - Charlie. Look, I'll go get Kate if you just lie back. No, no. Let me go. Helen, what? We got to go. We got to go. Helen! Helen? We' re over here. Drive faster, drive faster, drive faster. Helen, get a grip, will you, please? We' re here, all right? [Scoffs] What? Oh, for Christ's sake. Don't; you'll pull out your stitches! Oh, no! [Panting] [Inhales] Confess! This is madness! Won't any of you listen to me? You leave us no choice. Perfect. Marvelous. [Screams] No! Can we get some help? Let me go! Let me go! [Laughs] Let me go! No, no, no! You' re... [yelps] Charlie! Charlie! Charlie? Charlie! Are you okay? Mom? What are you doing here? You' re okay. Yeah, it's just the dry run. The show opens tomorrow night. I am so sorry. She just hasn't been herself recently. I'll keep you both in my prayers. Katie? [Objects clattering] Katie? [Knocks at door] Ow, fuck. Katie? You've got a lot of stuff in there. I got to take it down. Come on. Open the door. Katie? Katie? Damn it, Katie. Come on, let me. Let me in. You got to let me in. Katie? [Gasps] Oh, God, Charlie. [Shushes] [Broken glass jingling] [Sighs] Silverware? I'll get it. Kathryn. You' re not allowed to be in that play. What? You' re not allowed to be in the show. It opens in 24 hours. What are they supposed to do without me? It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. It's one thing for you to ruin my day, but you can't screw up the entire show for everyone. I'm trying to protect you. From what? Can we please just finish our meal in peace? I have to be at the airport in an hour. How can you let her do this to me? Tell her she's being unreasonable. Tell her she's wrong. Kathryn. Dad, do you really think that my theater teacher would try to hurt me? It doesn't matter what I think. It's just a high school play. This is not just about the play. Goddamn, tell her. Watch your language. Tell her she's completely crazy. Do you know what time it is? Lt's 7:36, Charlie. It's 7:36. He's coming at 10:28. We don't have time! We don't have time. You haven't touched your dinner. The Three Musketeers ends with a hanging. Othello strangles Desdemona. Judas Iscariot hangs himself at the end of Jesus Christ Superstar. What do you want me to say? It's terrible living like this. I'm late. No, no, Charlie. Charlie, don't go. Please, please, please, please, don't go. If I nail this, we can move out of here. Okay? Can you hold on until I get back? Yes. I love it when you laugh. It's beautiful. I love you. I love you. Oh, Christ. "And do not fear those "who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Hell. " [Echoing] 10:28. He's coming at 10:28. We don't have time! We don't have time. God damn it, Charlie, do something. Mrs. Bliss, she's a part of it. I'll keep you both in my prayers. [Horn honks] Go! Light's green! Yeah? What time does the show end tomorrow night? Around 10:30. Oh, my God. Kathryn. Please, just let me prove this to you when it comes tonight. Mom, I'm really... I don't... Please, Kathryn. If nothing happens, will you drop this? Come on, hurry. [Hinges creaking] I'm going to go get a jacket. Wait. [All chanting] Dehenia Ni'enen! Dehenia Ni'enen! [Screaming] [Coins clicking] [Alarm ringing] He's coming. [All chanting] Dehenia Ni'enen! Dehenia Ni'enen! [Demon howling] In exchange for our lovers, destroy our enemies. Kill Charlie Michaels. [Panting] [Sighs] [Demon shrieks] Dad! [Skull crunching] [Choking] [Groans] [Demon shrieks] I still can't let you perform tomorrow night. Why are you doing this to me? Because I love you. That does not make it okay. Katie, if anything happens to you... Nothing's going to happen to me, Mom, okay? Everything will be okay, if you just let it. But they' re still after us. Who? Who gives a fuck about our family? Why are you so adamant about this? Do you know something? Have you listened to yourself? Do you think with the entire audience watching, she would still kill me? She wouldn't have to. Mom, there's nothing there, and there never was. [Screams] Holy fuck! [Knocking at door] Hey. Is everything okay with your mom? [Sighs] Lt's just one of those days. Well, listen, we... there's a cast party going on. I want you to come. It'd do you good. - Um... - Please? Yeah? Do I have time to change? Absolutely. Okay. Can I come in or... I'm really sorry about the house. Okay. Oh, God. Mom? You got to listen to me, Pete. You have to, okay? Nobody else will. Just calm down. The Collector comes at 10:28. Sean figured it all out, wrote it all down in his notebooks. It was all shorthand, though. People were killed. Some were murdered... I mean, hung like Sean. I don't have it all figured out. But Sean had a girlfriend. Angela. Pete. Sean had a girlfriend he hid from us. What's wrong with you? How come you' re not saying anything? You don't want to know the rest. What? Don't. You knew? Just don't. Why didn't you say anything to us? Why didn't you tell us? Because I didn't say anything, I protected this whole fucking family. I held this family together. You don't understand, Mom. Then help me to understand. Angela was part of this cult, and your favorite blew them all up. He killed them, and then he killed himself because he couldn't live with the guilt. I can take you there. I can show you where it happened. No, come on! This way! What the hell? [Hard rock music] # # [laughter] Ooh. [Yelps and laughs] [Flames crackling] # # # Of what it means to be alive # # Suddenly doesn't mean that much # Relax, just go with it. # We came to fuck up everything # [man continues singing indistinctly] # Wishing # # It won't bring me back # # # [faint roaring] No. [Screams] [Yelps] [Groans] Dehenia Ni'enen. This was their house. He was madly in love with her. He was in a whole nother reality. She was always depressed and miserable, and she got involved with this demonic cult following... West Memphis Three... and she brought them to this fucking house. [Timbers creaking, glass shattering] What if he didn't cause the fire? What if Sean didn't cause the fire? He made a shitload of these in some abandoned factory outside of the cemetery. What if we find the explosives? What if we go to the factory and find the explosives? Just stop, just... I know this is hard. I know it's easier to believe in some heroic fantasy than to face this. No! If that's where you' re going to be, you're going to be there alone. Kate's play opens tonight. You should come. I'll save you a seat. I'm sorry. Sorry. [Haunting music] # # [gasps] [Winces] [Dramatic music] # # [footsteps crunching] [Faint conversation] You look nervous. Don't worry. You' re going to do great out there. Let me help you. [Gasps] Angela. I'm waiting for Sean. You' re waiting for Sean? When the Collector comes. What happened to the explosives? How can I find them? Just answer me! I tried to set it right, told him everything. We tried to destroy the following, but the detonators failed. Please, you have to help me. Can I still light the fuse? It's too short. I'm so sorry. Tell me how to get to them. [Footsteps] [Groans] If you resist me, you may find the church against you. [Shrieks] [Engine revs] Come on! [Coins jingling] [Swords clashing] [Cell phone buzzes] Yeah? Peter! No, Pete, shut up. Listen to me. I can't be two places at once, and I... I went to the factory again. They' re going to kill Kate. You have to get her out of there. Did you find the trunk? No, but there's not a lot of time left. They' re gonna... they' re gonna hang Kate. Peter, no! No, God. [Groans] [Long beep] Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. [Cheers and applause] [Gears clanking] Thank you, thank you. We will have a brief intermission before the last act. So please enjoy refreshments in the lobby. Thank you. [Door scrapes open] [Women moaning and gasping] [Whines] [People speaking indistinctly] [Sighs] [Whispering] Dehenia Ni'enen. [Straps zipping] Need any help? What the fuck happened last night? What do you mean? I don't even remember leaving my house. We never left the house. Stop fucking around. We went up to your bedroom, undressed. I don't believe you. I'm not a liar. You' re not a liar? Does God ever answer your prayers? No. What if he did? And all he asked for in exchange was to murder your lovers? [Screams] Mom was right. Peter? Run. Run! You gonna protect her with that? At least your brother died with some dignity. [Grunts] [Wood clatters] [Discordant piano strike] [Groans] [All chanting] Dehenia Ni'enen. Dehenia Ni'enen. Dehenia Ni'enen. Dehenia Ni'enen.
