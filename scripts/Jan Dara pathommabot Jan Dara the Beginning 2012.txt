My life has been a chain of unpredictable twists. If you really want to know... I was born while my mother was dying. Isn't that wicked? I was born in Bangkok... in the monsoon season of 1915, at the Pijitwanich Mansion in Bang Lampoo. It was the residence of my mother's family, a respectable merchant clan from the province of Pijit who had moved to the capital and prospered in wealth and social standing. But fate was unkind. My maternal grandparents passed away all of a sudden Madame Pijitraksa, my grandfather's sister, became the guardian of my mother. She also reigned as the matriarch of the Pijitwanich Mansion. Somjook, is it coming out? It's coming out ma'am! Or is it not? Watch what you're saying! You must be in great pain, Dara! Scream, dear! Scream and you'll feel better! Is that so? Yes, ma'am. Push! Push! It has come out! We have a young master. Oh god! The baby's been born! We have a young master, sir. Dara... Dara is gone... You scum! No! Get off me! No! I'll kill that piece of trash! Get off me! Move over, ma'am! Put it down! Don't you hear me? Put it down now! Don't curse this house with another death! Let Dara go in peace. All right. I'm Lord Wisnandecha! I swear by my soul that I' II curse that goddam child! I'll take revenge on him! May he rot in hell and be damned to eternal suffering. In this life and every one after this! Never, I'll never forgive you! Jan Rai - you scum! Now you know why I'm called Jan from Jan Rai, or scum. Followed by the aristocratic surname of the man whom I call father... "Wisnan"... "Jan Wisnan" was my name then. But "Jan the Scum" would've been more sensational. Because that was what he actually christened me. So mean. I'd like to make a vow with Dara's soul as my witness. For the rest of my life... I, Lord Wisnandecha... will never remarry. I'll mourn the death of my dear wife for three years. To honor her memory. And I ask everyone in this house to do the same. Among the relatives from Pijit who'd come for the funeral, there was a lady who possessed such classical beauty. She's Aunt Wad, the beloved cousin of my late mother. This is Wad, our cousin. Dara loved her so much. After paying respect to my mother, Aunt Wad told my grandmother that she wished to see me at the small house in the garden that served as a prison to the little murderer like myself. I was taken care of by Poom, and her one-year-old son, Ken. Don't worry my dear. I'll be your mother. Did I really hear what you just said? I' II stay here. I'll raise Jan myself. Thank you Wad! Madame, will we really call him "Jan"? It's adorable. Like "the moon" and "nutmeg". Who's know that Jan come from Janrai... The Scum. From that day on, Aunt Wad never returned to Pijit and moved permanently into the house. With the absence of the maternal liquid, she fed me with the imported milk Glaxo. Luck was on my father's side. After the 100-day memorial service of my mother, My grandmother had to leave the house on a three-month-long... overseas trip with the princess whom she served. I get it, ma'am. I'll te-le-graph Yes, te-le-graph. Chom, tell the male servants to watch the small house. Look after Miss Wad and baby Jan every night. Watch that house closely, get it? Yes, ma'am. Marvelous! It's certainly marvelous, right, Somjook? Marvelous indeed, ma'am. Goodbye then. From that moment on, my malicious father launched a campaign to seize power. I rule this place now! He began by kicking out the servants who refused to bow to him, forcing them to return to Pijit. Somjook was the invert maidservant closest to my grandmother. And my father employed a filthy trick to win him over to his side. For the female servants who'd served my aunt loyally, he conquered them, body and soul, with his erotic proficiency. Single or married, they melt without resistance. Even Poom wasn't spared. Poom, the recently widowed mother of Ken. Oh my god! It's me! When was the last time you slept with a man? Not since Ken's father died. It is my lucky night! Before long, all servants once faithful to my grandmother... defected to my father and became his sex slaves. The next target in this politics of seduction was no one else but Aunt Wad, the woman who loved me like my real mother. Jom... Our love is doomed. Our families are sworn enemies... They despise each other. It's a consequence from the sins of our forefathers. It's not fair to us. No... It's not fair to us. Jom I love you. How can I live without you? Runaway with me please. I'm scared... That's the only way we can live together. Wait until my heart is stronger. I will wait for you. Wait... my lord What happened? I desire you. I have since the first time I met you. You must promise me one thing first. Anything, love. Promise me that no matter how intensely you detest Jan you must never harm him to death. Give me your word. And I' II give my whole life to you, my lord. I promise. Wad! Who got you pregnant? Who did it? Tell me! It's lord, right? Tell me! That pervert knocked you up?! Yes, ma'am. Damn you! I trusted you, and you behave like a harlot! You harlot! Disgusting, I' II kill you! Scandalous! A curse on the house! I' II kill you! Damn it, I' II kill you! Bastard! I' II blow your brains out! Ma'am, that gun is an antique. It's not even loaded. I think you might want to try... this gun instead! It's fully loaded and cocked! Stupid hag, get out! Get out of this house! Are you going or not? If not, come play with my rifle! Let's screw, hag! Come here! No! I won't! I'm going! Finally my father succeeded in staging a coup and seizing the power to rule Pijitwanich Mansion from my grandmother. Through his sordid manipulations and filthy, depraved cunning. "Aunt Wad" You paid respect to your mother, do the same to your father when he comes back. Yes, Aunt Wad. Kaew, come have some sweets. Jan, have some sweets with your sister. No, not stupid Jan! Who taught you that? Buga, who taught Kaew to say that? Good afternoon, father. I've told you a dozen times not to let this scum on the main house. He's here to pay respect to his mother, and to you too. He' II leave soon. Look at him, Kaew. That devil killed his own mother. Call him Jan Rai - scum! Jan Rai, Jan Rai! Wilailek "Kaew" Wisnan. Jan's here. Come take a picture with Kaew and me. Yes, Aunt Wad. No! Not with stupid Jan! Kaew, I've told you not to call him that! No! Not with stupid Jan! You won't? No! Stop it! I won't! You won't, huh? You' re not my mother's son and you're not my father's son! Master Jan, go back to our home. I have to pay respect to my father first. Don't do it today. No, I have to bow at him every day. Skip it today, trust me! I can't. Good afternoon, father. That's for harassing my daughter. But I didn't do anything. Shut up, devil! Stupid Jan! Stupid Jan! Nobody knows... that for every punishment... and every painful blow I took... I remember the guilt that had been born with me. My lord, Master Jan has passed out! Please stop, my lord. Please! Take this scum out of my sight! I deserved it. I was the one who caused my mother's death. Mother... Please don't let anything happen to Master Jan. Go take a bath, Ken. You can come see him later. Yes, ma'am. Jan... Jan... Am I really father's son? What does it matter? It's enough that you're your mother's child and my nephew. I miss my mother. I want her to hold me. I can hold you. The Peoples' Party, civil servants, soldiers and civilians, have seized power to govern the country from the king. Members of the Royal Family are now held hostages. Should the Peoples' Party be harmed in any way, we will harm the Royal members in retaliation. The Peoples' Party have no wish to usurp the throne. Our intention is to introduce a constitution as the supreme law to govern the country. We ask everyone who do not take part in the revolution against the monarchial government to remain calm. Quiet! Go back to work! Get up. Does it hurt? A little... Keep it wrapped like this. Go see a doctor later. Thank you. And your handkerchief? It's yours now. Wait... What? What's your name? Hyacinth. And you? I'm Jan. Jan Wisnan. I have to go. The prince was taken by the Peoples' Party to the Marble Throne Hall. I'm so worried. I' II have to talk to Luang Pradit to release him. Is it that bad? They've held my prince hostage. They'll force His Majesty to accept the proposal. They've seized several members of the Royal family. I've heard the same thing, father. Good evening, father. You' re back early. Usually you won't be home before 9. He must have skipped school to run around with his friends. All classes were canceled because... Shut your mouth! You're a waste. Scum! Come have your tea before it gets cold. Jan, go to get Miss Kaew to come have tea with father. Tell her to come right away. He has to leave soon. Yes, Aunt Wad. Ken the Golden Bull! Ken the Golden Bull! Saisoi. Give this to Ken. Yes, Miss Kaew. Miss Kaew... Aunt Wad asks you to go see father in the house, Who is your father. Stupid Jan. From Miss Kaew. Go thank her. Thank you, Miss Kaew. Win again next time. I' II give you a bigger prize. I sure will, Miss Kaew. Saisoi, let's go. Yes Miss Kaew. You're devastating! You can easily beat professional boxers! Your support gave me strength, Master Jan. I didn't do anything. You sure did. Master Jan, would you like me to prepare dinner now? Do it now, mother. I'm starving. I didn't ask you! What's the difference? I always eat at the same table as Jan. Arrogant brat! You think you're the equal of your master! I'll hit you with the pestle! Poom, set the table now. I'm hungry too. Right away, master! Kaew, you're a young lady now. Watch your manners when you speak. Especially when you talk to your brother. Jan is not my brother. Watch your mouth! Show some respect! I respect every word you say. Except about stupid Jan. Why? You always take his side. He never does anything wrong! Why? Because you love him... You love him more than your own flesh and blood. You love him even though you know he's not father's son! You have no right to say that! Go to your room now! What's all that shouting? Nothing. I was talking some sense into Kaew. How's about the prince? It's fortunate that Luang Pradit still values our friendship. So the rebels agreed to release him back to the palace. Don't tell anyone, but the prince will leave for Singapore tomorrow morning. I' II have to go with him. I' II go for a few weeks, tell the servants to pack my things now. Master Jan, what's the trouble out there? They've seized power from the king. They say he wasn't ruling the country well. How dare they! Heads will roll! The rebels were foreign educated, they're not afraid of such ancient curses. All my life, I never saw the king did anything wrong. We had a good life here. They took his power and they think they can turn Siam into paradise? Only their kind of paradise. Plague on their houses! I think so. What time is it now? Almost midnight. I have to go now. Why such a hurry? My paradise is waiting for me. You know where I'm going. Don't play dumb! What! Do you want to come and watch? You' re crazy! Enjoy yourself. In the room. Hyacinth! Jan! Is your leg all right now? It's fine now. I didn't know you were also a student here. I've studied here for three years. You must be very good now. Well... I'm doing just fine. Please help me. This is my first day. I don't know anyone except you. Of course. You can ask me anything. Thank you. You' re welcome. I'm going home now. Hyacinth! Where do you live? Just around here. Me too. Let me take you home. I wonder who's taking who home? I've come with you, or you've come with me? What? I don't understand. This is my street. Really? Yes. Master Jan, school's out already? You' re back so early! And what' re you doing here? For the sweet taro. Want some? Ken, this is Hyacinth, my friend from the language school. Hyacinth, this is Ken, my best friend. Hyacinth lives around here. I'm not his friend, I'm his servant. I'd better get going. I'll walk you. I'm going now. See you back at the house. Yes, Master. Here we are. Thank you for walking me. My pleasure. See you soon. Yes, see you soon. Hats off! That Hyacinth is breathtaking! We're a perfect duo, master and servant! Listen to me, it's time for you to lose your innocence. Insane! Not at all! Men our age have to do it. It's natural. Don't say I didn't warn you. What do you mean? You're in love. And when a man and a woman are in love, they'll want to be alone together. You'll start by talking. But talking is never satisfying. You'll move closer and hold hands. And now, the irresistible fragrance of teen spirit will smother you. Your hands will seek touch, your lips will long for soft flesh, To feel what's hidden under the clothes. That's enough! No, I haven't finished! I should smack you! I'm scared now... daddy Good boy. Master Jan, when your tongue kisses her flesh... Especially the tip of her nipples... You' II hear a soft moaning mixed with heavy, rapid panting. She' II whisper your name, the sweetest sound in the world! Your hand will crawl lower, lower... until you reach a glorious mound covered with moss. Soft or stiff, it depends. Really? Then you'll find a wet cliff from which drops of magic water seep, inviting you to taste it. Master Jan, that's pure bliss! Obscene! I won't hear it! Obscene? If it's obscene, the whole world is obscene! Our ancestors were obscene! You have a point. The point is simple... I think it's time for you to experience the real thing. When you find yourself in a critical situation, you can't afford to be clumsy. It'll be a stain on your manhood. Try it once, and you' II crave for more. You' II forget your little five angels forever, trust me. And who'll do it with me? Saisoi. She'll be your mentor. But isn't Saisoi your girl? Not my girl, just my play mate. Will she let me? She'll throw herself at you. Well, you're the young master of the house. And you're one handsome devil. Don't you realize how good-looking you are? Any woman who wouldn't take you to her bed is mental. And honestly, I've run out of juice tonight. Run out of juice? I banged the sweet taro vendor twice this afternoon. Do me a favor and entertain Saisoi tonight. Let me think about it. No time to think! Trust me! Go! Master Jan... Ken told me to... come see you. Take off your clothes. Your pants too. But... Do you want me to do it for you? I'll do it myself... I can do it. What's so funny? Your little master is... cute. It's like... a little mouse. I think it's more like a rabbit. So let me feel it... to see if it's a mouse or a rabbit. Go on, feel it. So? A mouse or a rabbit? Neither. What? It's a baby dragon... so adorable. That's good to know. Your breasts are like morning lotuses. Feel them. So soft. Kiss them. They smell better than lotuses. Master Jan... Master Jan! Everyone! Master Jan just did it! And he shot his load too fast! Jan shot his load too fast! So, are you a baby mouse or a little rabbit? Baby mouse or little rabbit! A dragon! A fire-breathing dragon! From then on, Ken's room became our ecstasy garden. A hotbed of erotic practices to all young boys of the Wisnan Mansion. We had two voluptuous experts training us, Ken and Saisoi. They groomed their pupils in the bottomless art of sexual athleticism, They demonstrated their techniques through sweaty, physical exhibits. And I regarded it all as the fine art of anatomy, an engraving of flesh and nakedness. Ken. Miss Kaew wants you to go up and move her dressing table. Wash your hands and feet first. Miss Kaew, Ken is here. What could I do for you, Miss Kaew? Move that dressing table to the corner. Yes, Miss Kaew. Saisoi, help him. Yes Miss Kaew. Right there. You can go now, Ken. Your name, Hyacinth, what does it mean? It's a flower, the same family as Lily. It looks like our gladiolus and water flower, but the petal is yellow and pinkish. My father said it doesn't grow in Siam. I never saw it either. It must be a very beautiful and fragrant flower. I hope it is. Are you living just with your father? Yes, my mother died when I was very young. I'm sorry. It's all right. Father is everything to me. He's my father, my mother and my best friend. Ken. You scared me! Miss Kaew asked me to give you this, for helping her with the dressing table. Put it there, I'm taking a bath. It's very hot. Can I join you? Are you crazy? No I'm not. Let me soap you. Don't be nasty! We' II be in trouble if someone sees us. No one will see us. If Miss Kaew sees us... She's having her nap. The others are working and won't come here. Do you think it's all right? Of course. So exciting. Exciting... You'll like it, Ken. Thank you for coming with me. Dad is here. You' re back. Dad, this is Jan. He helped me on the day of the coup. Oh right. Oh right. Good evening, sir. Thank you. I heard you also live around here? Yes. At Wisnan Mansion. That big mansion. I'm tired, dear. I'll leave now. Go on, young man. See you soon, Jan. See you Hyacinth. What do you want? Money? Watch? You can take them all. Money and watch of course. But we want something else first. What? We want your pretty ass, rich boy! Grab him! Help! Help! Help me! What's that noise? Help me please! Sounds familiar... Help! Help me! Help me! Asshole! Bastard! None of your business! It is! He's my master! Kill him! You want my ass? What's so funny? That was really close! If I hadn't shown up in time, they'd have feasted on your pretty ass. Idiot. You must have been to Hyacinth's. Next time if you're going home this late, let me come with you. Those wretches were just out of prison, high on opium. They were horny, they couldn't resist your doll-like face. Dirty Ken. Master Jan, you came out of your girlfriend's house so late... you two must have done it! Can you share her with me? I always want to bang an Indian girl! Can't we at least have one good woman whom we treasure? You' re jealous! I should've let those three hump you! Pervert! Don't run away! Catch me if you can! You boys are here. Why are you back so late? I went to see some friend. Do you have something to talk to me? Your father wrote me a letter... telling me he's coming home with his "former lover". Why' re you crying, Aunt Wad? Forget it. Promise me that you'll be a good boy and don't cause your father any trouble. I promise. Father's "old lover"? We only knew that her name was Madame Boonlueng, a rich widow from Phuket. They hadn't met in 20 years, but father ran into her in Singapore. She wouldn't come alone. She'd come with Mr. Kajorn, her 19-year-old son and a military cadet. They'd stay with us during the weekend. The right wing on the third floor was converted into a private quarters of the two guests. All Boonleung's furniture was shipped from Singapore before her arrival. Saisoi is pregnant! Three months, ma'am! God help us! What's the matter? I'm in trouble! Answer me! Stop! She's pregnant! Stop! You' II hurt the baby! Stop! It's Ken, right? Ken is the father, right? No, Miss! It's Master Jan! No, it's Ken! I slept with her only a few times, you must have banged her a hundred times! Maybe God blesses her to be your wife! Damn it Ken! I shouldn't have let you drag me into this! Master, don't panic! How can I not? I assure you that Saisoi's pregnancy will never cause any trouble to you or to me, trust me! The thing is, Saisoi doesn't just sleep with the two of us. She's here, as agreed. She also did it with the Chinese man who runs a shop on the main street. She often slipped out in the afternoon when Miss Kaew had her nap. She's three months gone right? It was less than three months when you started banging her. So stop worrying. That's right. By the way, is it all right to do it with a pregnant woman? You're a piece of work! How many times did you do her! I'll slug you! On the day my father and Madame Boonlueng returned from Singapore, the Chinese man came to take Saisoi to live with him. Are you sad? Plenty of birds, I' II find a new one. I later found out that Miss Kaew had a repulsion against the unsightly shape of pregnant women. So she arranged for Saisoi to leave the house for good. Here's Wilailek Wisnan, or Kaew, my daughter. Good afternoon, Madame Boonlueng. Welcome to Wisnan Mansion. Thank you, Miss Kaew. You're such an adorable young lady. This is Kajorn, my son. I hope you too will become friends. Good afternoon. I'm delighted to have you in our family. The pleasure is mine, Miss Kaew. This is Wad, Wilailek's mother. Good afternoon. Please make yourself at home. Thank you for your kindness. And these are the servants who' II look after you. Nice to meet you all. Our lives are in your hands now. Please be kind to us. Please go upstairs and make yourself comfortable. Snacks are ready on the balcony. This way please. Please, Boonlueng. You must be tired. What else can I do? A servant is always the one who sweats. Fancy a drink? Whiskey or juice? Ken, you're a handsome devil! Yourself likewise! I hardly see you dressed up like this. You're better-looking than that Mr. Kajorn. Watch it Ken. He's coming down. Ma'am, uncle and my mother will come down a little late. So I' II help you take care of the guests in the meantime. Mr. Kajorn, this is Jan, the lord's eldest son. Good evening, Mr. Kajorn. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Jan. My pleasure. Drink, sir? I'm so sorry! I'm sorry about that. Ken is not familiar with formal functions. It's all right, ma'am. Don't worry about it. Excuse me for a moment, ma'am... Mr. Jan. Ken, behave your manners. It was an accident. I didn't mean to spill it. Foreign guests are here, Jan please welcome them. Yes, Aunt Wad. Good evening, Sir. Good evening. Welcome to the party. Lord Wisnandecha, Madame Boonlueng... They are very busy right now. I guess they will be in the party in a few minutes. This way please. Now they are coming, Sir. Welcome Peter. Welcome to my house. Good evening Lord Wisnandecha. Good evening, Madame Boonlueng. Good evening, Peter. Thank you for coming. It's my pleasure. May I introduce my daughter, Mary.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am lord Wisnandecha, your host tonight... and president of Bangkok Pijitwanich Company. I'm delighted to make an announcement that my company had signed a deal to form an international joint venture with East Asia Company of Mr. Peter Owen in Singapore already. I believe that our company will continue to prosper and play a leading role I believe that our company will continue to prosper and play a leading role in the international trade between Siam and the world. I'm pleased to announce Madame Boonlueng Jangtrakul of Phuket International Enterprise as an executive consultant in this project. To celebrate this special occasion That's what it's all about, Jan. I'd like to introduce you to the most amazing woman in my life... Madame Boonlueng. I'm not much of a speaker, please allow me to sing you a song to celebrate this delightful evening. When will you find me? When will we I see you again? We've pledged our love Before we parted, I still remember We' re apart, but our hearts are near The sadness mixed with fear You' re overwhelmed, but I keep crying Don't you know, inside I'm weeping I've been thinking about the time we shared The promise that you'll come and take me everywhere! When will I be satisfied? How I wish time could fly! Wherever you wish, I'll go with you My love is strong, I'm not afraid of anything Thinking about the time we shared... Thinking about the time we shared... From that day on... From that day on... Thinking about the promise... Thinking about the promise... That you' II come and take me... When will I be satisfied? How I wish time could fly! Wherever you wish, I'll go with you My love is strong, I'm not afraid of anything This morning, the government of Kingdom of Siam has suppressed the coup attempt led by Prince Boworadej at the battle at Bang Khen field. We now ask all citizens to remain calm. Do not attempt any hostile activities against the government. We hereby announce this to all of you. Let's have breakfast. I'll just have coffee. I'm in a hurry to see the prince. What's the matter? Prince Boworadej's troops were defeated by the government's at Bang Khen. The soldiers from Korat were charged with treason. I'm worried about my prince... I'm afraid he'll get caught in the mess. I guess the Palace Ministry will soon be abolished. Are you leaving now? I can't stomach anything now. Maybe I' II eat something at the prince's palace. Uncle, would you give me a ride to the school? Of course. But please stop calling me "uncle". Call me "father". Yes, father. Madame Boonleung, is there anything? I'd like to thank you for arranging the party last night. You must be exhausted. This is a small gift from me. A perfume that's very popular around the world. Thank you so much. I wasn't that tired actually. The servants worked much harder than I did. Please thank them all for me. I will. Miss Wad, I'm an honest woman, I can't speak with a sugar tongue. I'd like to make myself clear, because we' re now sharing the same roof. I never wanted anything when I decided to come live here with my lord. I believe you've heard about my financial status... Yes, I have. I mean, we're no longer young. What happens in bed isn't a matter of life and death to us any more Do you agree? So why have you come here? For business? No. Not at all! Then what is it? I've come here for love. If you've ever loved someone with the burning passion of a young heart... but you never had a chance to share your life with him. You' II understand why I'm here. I understand you, sincerely. Thank you so much. Ken, is that you? Are you Jan? You shouldn't come here. Why not? No one comes in here, except Aunt Wad, Poom and Ken. If father knows, there' II be a big trouble! Then don't let him know. Your drawing is very impressive. Did you sketch these from photographs, or from experience? Please give it back to me. What if... I refuse? Then I'm in big trouble. Actually, you should let me keep it as a welcome present. Let me find something else for you. How would you know what I like and what I don't, young man? Wait, Madame. Madame Boonleung. Ma'am! Madame Boonleung! You play so beautifully, just like your singing. Thank you. I've brought you these carved fruits as a small gift. A token of goodwill from me. Thank you. They' re so beautiful that I don't want to eat them! People are like fruits. We have to peel off the skin and clean it first, before we can taste its true flavor. Don't you agree? Look at the fabric I just bought, ma'am! Isn't it gorgeous? Very much! I have no idea about the pattern that match it You should flip through the European magazines in my room. They have plenty of new patterns. See which one you like. Go on, don't be shy. Thank you. You shouldn't indulge her. Her father has spoiled her enough. It's only natural. Women her age are interested in fashion. I went to Jan's garden house today. Did you meet that scum? I did. He seems like a well-mannered young gentleman. I admire Miss Wad who looks after the whole house and also raised the two children. Miss Kaew and Mr. Jan. Jan... Right... Jan. Both Miss Kaew and Jan have grown up like a highborn lady and gentleman. And most importantly... I also found Jan's English-language notebook. He has a knack for English composition, good grammar and idea. His English skill is really beyond his age. You should send him to study in England. That would be a disaster. I think we should have someone who speaks good English to look after our Singaporean office. Someone we can trust, someone who can be your eyes and ears. And who'd be better than a man who grew up in our own family. Look at his purple mushroom! And the pus! Disgusting! What's wrong with me? It's the clap! You' re lucky the whole stick didn't come off! You won't be able to use it for months. Serves you right! Horny brat! Hot rod, huh? How can I go on living now? Mr. Jan, your father wants you at the main house. I've discussed with Madame Boonleung and Wad already, if your English lesson has improved, I will send you to study in England. On one condition... You have to top your class in every subject. And I' II send you to England next year, do you get that? Yes, father. The notebook I borrowed from you. If you go abroad, who'll hang out with me here? Don't worry Ken. If I really get to go to England, I'll find a way to bring you with me. Trust me. Great! I'll bang every white chicks I meet! Didn't you learn your lesson? I'm a slow learner. Madame Boonlueng hasn't returned my sketchbook. How can I get it back? Simple. Just waltz in there and take it! Suicidal! If father finds out, I won't get to go to England. Soomjook is such a big mouth. Easy. My mother told me that every afternoon, Lamiad will bring tea and snacks to Madame Boonlueng. Toh, Lamiad is your girl, right? Yes. So you'll do everything in your power to prevent Lamiad from going up to serve Madame. Lamiad About that big-mouthed Somjook, Tai will take care of him. Aunt Somjook, is this nice? Yes. Let me take you to the bathroom. You' II feel even nicer there. Come with me. See, now you can sneak upstairs to see Madame Boonlueng. But you have to make sure to get out before Miss Kaew or the lord returns. Trust your Ken, a walk in the park, sir. Lamiad? It's me. Would you give my sketchbook back, ma'am? Jan... Wait a moment. Were you peeping? No! I didn't mean to! Young man... No gentleman would mean to watch a woman taking a bath, right? I guess so, ma'am. I confess that I can't remember where I've put your sketchbook. Damn... Don't worry, I'm sure it's somewhere in my bedroom. I'll turn the place over tonight. I' II leave you now. Why such a hurry? You' re already here, stay and talk to me. Yes, ma'am. You must have seen my art pieces on the balcony. Yes. I never knew you're such a skilled artist. I love to draw. My father sent me to study art in France when I was young. All kinds of art can polish the human mind to achieve purity. Just like religion. Think about it, all masterpieces are either in temples or cathedrals. It's boiling in here. Can you rub ice on my back? Will that be all right? Why wouldn't it? I don't know. If Kajorn were here, he would do that for me. I think you're even younger than my son. Come here. Take it right now! Yes, ma'am. Come sit here. And rub ice on my back, gently. Yes. What' re you waiting for? It's going to melt. Yes. That feels good. Behave yourself, young gentleman! You scum Punish me! Hit me! Mommy, help me! Daddy hit me! Mommy, help me! Daddy I'm scared, please stop! Don't be afraid. You didn't do anything wrong. It was only an accident. Ken! Why are you doing this? Help me! Help me! Some body help me! Some body help me! Master! Please, Master Jan! Please! Please listen to me! Help! Please listen to me! Help me! What's that noise? It sounds like Kaew. Isn't that Kaew crying? I think so, ma'am. Master, please! Listen to me, please! My poor child! What's happening? Mother, please help me! Mother, please help me! Bring Miss Kaew to the main house first! It's all right now, my child. Madame Wad... Miss Kaew was the one who... Ken, I never thought you could be so immoral! Toh, Tai, bring Ken to the main house! What's going on? Ken raped Miss Kaew! What's going on? Ken raped Miss Kaew! What's all this ruckus? Ken raped Miss Kaew, sir. Poom, Ken, in the hall, now! I' II leave Kaew with you. I' II take care of her. How dare your son did that to my daughter? I... Traitors! Ken, I' II throw you in jail! Somjook, tell the driver to get the police! Yes, my lord. Somjook, stay where you are. What the hell are you doing here? I raped Miss Kaew. Ken didn't do it. Right, father. Jan raped me. If Ken hadn't found us, Jan would've crushed me! I should've killed you when your mother died! You're not going to England now! Bastard child! My lord! Shut up, Wad! You're not my son. Your father is a bandit, remember that! Stop it! No! Your father raped your mother. I was forced to accept you as my child Like father like son! You scum! You' re out of my life, little fuck! Fine. You and I... We' re through! I' II kill you! What' re you doing?! What am I doing? I'll get my gun! You can't do that! Why can't I? Because you promised me you wouldn't! If you hadn't promised, Kaew wouldn't have been here! Yes, but what that scum did to Kaew can only be paid by death! No! Please! Jan, go! Run away, now! I beg you my lord, please. Calm down. Master, please! Let me go! Let me go! Aunt Somjook is dead. It was an accident. Jan, you can't be here, you have to run away. Where? To Pijit, to your grandmother. Leave tonight! Kaew, see what you've done? Evil child! Get the fuck out of here, scum! Miss Kaew came to me. She seduced me. She ordered me to tie her up. She forced me to do it. Or she'd scream. I didn't want to do it. I told her I had the disease, but she wouldn't listen. It's my curse to have her as a daughter. Stupid Ken! Hadn't Master Jan helped you... The lord would've killed you then and there I owe you my life. I'll never forget it. Ken... You saved me once too. Now we' re even. Aunt Wad. Was my father really a thief? It's time for you to know the truth. Our Pijitwanich family is an old clan that prospered from trading rice and timber. It was unfortunate that our elders didn't live long. Only your grandfather's sister has lived to take care of the business. She has only two grandchildren. Your mother, Miss Dara, who grew up in Bangkok. And myself, who grew up in Pijit. One day I went to the temple and I met Jom, who became my lover. But our love was forbidden, because our families are sworn enemies. We had to keep it a secret, we had to hide our relationship from our families. At that time, I gave myself to Jom, because I loved him from the bottom of my heart. One day grandmother took your mother to visit our house in Pijit. Miss Dara was a breathtaking beauty. She was also a young millionaire, so her reputation preceded her. She had so many suitors, young and old, merchants and civil servants. One day I went to see Jom where we always had our trysts. But for the first time he didn't turn up, and I never thought that it was a forewarning. That same afternoon grandmother took Miss Dara to visit a relative in a distant village. On the way back, Jom and two other men ambushed them and kidnapped your mother into the forest. Help me! Jom ravaged her during that horrible fortnight in the woods. When the police finally tracked down his hideout... there was a gunfight. The bodies of Jom's friends floated down the stream into the city. But the police didn't find Jom, they only found the half-dead Dara. Maybe Jom got away, but no one knew and no one ever saw him again. Grandmother hurried to bring your mother back to Bangkok to put the memory of such horrendous incident behind. But soon after, your mother was pregnant, and grandmother had to cover up the scandal by finding a suitable man to marry her. She found Lord Wisnandecha, a palace official from an aristocratic family that had fallen from grace. He became Miss Dara's husband and your "father". So my real father is... Jom. Yes. So you've raised me and protected me with great love and mercy... because I'm Jom's son. Because you're the son of the two people I loved the most. Hurry up, or you' II miss the train. Ma'am, since we were young, Master Jan and I are always together. Please let me continue to serve him in Pijit. I beg you. Please. Then pack your things. Poom, help him. Yes, ma'am. Stop here. Hyacinth... It's you. Jan! Where have you been? We were just talking about you! I have to go to Pijit now, I don't know when I' II be back. I' II write you. Please remember that I' II never forget you. I have to go. This is it. Goodbye Aunt Wad. Start a new life in Pijit. Goodbye, Mother. Take care of Master Jan. You can trust me. You'd better get going. Right, Aunt Wad. Take care of yourself. Goodbye Poom. Goodbye sir. Aunt Wad, since I'm not his real son, can I change my last name? You can use your mother's family name. I' II use my mother's name. From now on I'm "Jan Dara". What's a beautiful name. Jan Dara says goodbye now.
