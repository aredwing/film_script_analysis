Otherwise she's gonna keep me on the phone half the night. Hang up on her, Wade. I can't do that. Will you just... talk to her? Just... tell her I'm in the bathroom and I'll call her back later. Please. I'm in the bathroom, Wade. Yeah, Jeanette? Yeah. Um, he says he's gonna... be in the bathroom. He'll call you back. You know, I should probably go over to my mom's. I was supposed to be there, like, two hours ago. Hm. I wouldn't worry about her. She made a pact with the devil, remember? Good rest ye merry cheating wives, nothing you dismay. But that won't be a problem if you never would have strayed. What do you think? Maybe I'll cut a record, huh? Think it's got potential? What are you doing here, Keith? What am I doing here? It's, uh... it's a good question. I, uh... I don't know. Not anymore. Oh my god. Relax, sweetheart. I'm not here to hurt you. Just want you to see something. No! Well look who finally decided to show up. You have any idea what time it is? Couldn't help it. Something terrible happened. Keith s... I know. Larry called. He heard it on the police scanner. He always said he would. I just didn't believe him. I never thought for a second he would have... Don't. Don't. Don't cry. It's too late for tears now. What you did to Keith, there's no escaping it. Did you get your medication? I forgot. Shelley. Bruce! Oh my god! Hey! What are you doing here? - Moved back. - You moved back... Just got here a couple days ago. Well, I never think you would come back, living in Vegas and all. - Yeah, Vegas didn't treat me so good. - Oh. I got to like gambling a little too much. Been working up near Truckee last couple years. - Yeah? Doing... - Law enforcement. - If you can believe that. - Very nice. - I just transferred to Meadville. - Great. - Shelley, your order's up. - Hold on a second, Bruce. Right. Here. Avocado and noodles. You guys good? Yeah. And- and you? What's new with you? How's your mom? Um... pretty much the same, actually. And, and Keith? Sorry. That's, uh, that's actually a long story, Bruce. Oh. You look good. Aw, thanks. So do you. Um, I was hoping I'd run into you. I've been so busy since I got back I haven't seen anybody from school, and... Shelley? Bucktoothed moron by the window wants his check. Oh. Bruce, you kind of... you caught me at a really busy time. Is there any way we can do this... Maybe we can get together sometime, and- and really catch up. I would really like that. I want to hear all about Vegas. Yeah. There's a lot to tell. Later, Bruce! Where's that good looking deputy we just hired? I'm gonna go home and- and grab a little sleep. I got a long night ahead of me. Me too. They put me on a double. Can you believe that? Hey, excuse me, can you tell me how to get to Pine Grove Avenue? Uh, yeah, just, uh go down to the light, and, uh, make a right, and, uh, go about two blocks. You should see it right there. You look like a whore. You know, the kind of woman that makes a man leave his wife and child. Kind of woman that makes a man take his own life. Who are you? You know it's- it's really not a problem with me if you're a whore, but then again, I ain't one of the ones you been hurtin'. You've never seen him before? Never. He- he doesn't sound like anybody Jeanette would know. How do you know who Jeanette knows, Ryan? He- he- he could be a hitman. You know how crazy she is. She's not that crazy. Oh no? Calling us at three, four, five o'clock in the morning, Ryan? Calling my own mother to have her turn against me? Your mother was already against you. Yeah, well you know at least she didn't get somebody to show up at my work and call me a whore. You don't know that was Jeanette. Who else would it be, Ryan? She's- she's- she's going around town telling everybody lies about me. You know, people think I killed Keith. Nobody thinks you killed Keith. Everybody thinks that, Ryan, or else they think you did it. I just- I'm going crazy. I'm going out of my mind, Ryan. Okay. Okay. Whoa. Come on. Why don't we just go out somewhere. I don't want to go out. People just stare. Wade told me about this party way up in Pulaski. - Pulaski? - Yes. Nobody knows us out there. We're supposed to get, like, two feet of snow. I have four wheel drive. Larry, it's me. I know it's you. There's a thing called caller ID, you know. Or are you too drunk to remember? Don't start with me. Hey, I didn't start anything. You called me. So what favor can I do for you? You really think I only call if I want something, don't you? No, I don't think, I know. So what is it? Are you listening to your scanner right now? I'm always listening. Well, Shelley was supposed to come by a couple hours ago, and she didn't. That's typical Shelley. Yeah, well, she's a little later than usual, and I got a little worried, so... Well, I haven't heard anything about any accidents. Does that set your mind at ease? It does. Good. Bitch. Jerk. Well, damn. Look at all that snow. You sure you don't want to stay the night? No, we should get going before it gets too bad. Already bad. We'll be fine. Go away! You're not welcome here. Hey, watch it! Friendly local morons. Damn-it, open the door! I will break this damn door down. Don't think I won't. Bull crap he's not. Where is he? I don't know. I haven't seen him all night. I'm sick and damn tired of him not picking up my phone calls. He is the father of my child. How does he know Eliot's not sick or something? Is Eliot sick? That's not the damn point. The point is he's irresponsible... running around with that slut, and ignoring his duty as a father. You want a beer? It's Jeanette, isn't it? - Yeah. - Oh my god! How many times is she gonna call tonight? As many times as she calls every other night. Why don't we just... why don't we just keep going? Why don't we just run away, right now? Look, we can't do that, alright? I got a kid... and you have your mother to take care of. Yeah, I don't care anymore. She can find somebody else to look after her. You can call for Eliot later. Yeah. Jeanette would never let that happen. Then let's steal him. Let's go over there right now and take him. You want to? Yeah. What's to stop us? I mean, he's your son. How long has that car been behind us? What car? The one behind us. I never noticed. Just... just make the next turn you can. - Why? - Just do it. - It's him. - Who? The man outside the diner. It's him, Ryan. He's following us. - You think? - Yeah, I think. Oh my god, he... he probably wants to kill us. He... he's gonna try to run us off the road and kill us. - Go faster, Ryan, you gotta go fast... - I can only go so fast in all this snow. Just... just... just... just... He must have run off the road. - He disappeared. - What... - Oh my god, Ryan! Stop! - What... - You hit him! - I did not! Yes you did! Just stop the car. A minute ago you tell me to drive faster. - Now you want me... - Just stop the truck, Ryan! Fine. Hello? Hello? Is anybody there? I'm sure I didn't hit anybody. Ryan, I saw him, okay? There's no blood. There, look! Look! - Where? - There. There's... blood everywhere. Oh. Oh my god. Oh my god, you're right. Oh, God, what... are you sure it was, like, it was a person? - It wasn't, like, a deer or something? - I mean, I don't know, Ryan. - Come here. - I just saw it for a second, - it just... - Well, where is he? Hello? Where are you? Do you think we should call the sheriff? No. Because they'll think we did it on purpose. Why... why would they think that? - Because it was him. - Who? That guy. The guy from the diner earlier, it was him. I mean, I only saw it for a second, but I'm pretty sure. Shelley, come on. How could it be him? How could he be behind us one second and then in front of us the next? I don't know, okay? But I... I really think it was him. You didn't happen to see the name of the road we're on, did you Uh... why? I just got a little turned around, that's all. You- you- do you need a map? No, Shelley, the map is not gonna do any good if I don't know where I am. Well, are we lost? We're a little lost. Is that like being a little pregnant? No. Look, we're gonna be okay, all right? We- we've been driving for, what, an hour now? We can't be too far from home. Is that a car up there? Yeah. What's it doing in the middle of the road with no lights on? May- maybe they're in trouble and need some help. We could use a little help ourselves. Be right back. - That's so weird. - Weird? What was weird? Uh, there's insects inside the car. - Insects? - Yeah. Flies or something. No people? What... No. Nothing but flies. We're playing the songs of the season here at KPOX, and we've got a big old storm brewing outside right now. Hello? Miranda, it's Gayle. Shelley's mom? Oh. Hi. Has- has Shelley called you by any chance? Uh, tonight? No, why? Well, I haven't heard from her, and I was, uh, was getting a little concerned. It's snowing like you can't believe outside. Oh, global warming. I'm sorry? We're gonna get a lot more snow because of global warming. We're gonna get a lot more of everything. Sweetie, you might wanna renew your subscription to Time Magazine, if you ever had one. Um... I also, I don't think that's how global warming works. And if Shelley calls, I will make sure that I don't get a hold of you. - I'm sorry? - Um, nothing. I'm just gonna go to bed, okay? Have a good night. Painkiller. You bastard. The National Weather Service is calling for as much as three feet of snow. And if we're lucky, they'll taper off before morning, with temperatures as low as zero. Yeah, that's right, we're talking zero. Hey, hey, hey, there's a sign right there. Where? Where? Right there, right there. Slow down. - What? - Roll down the window... - Yeah. You see it? - No, I can't see anything. No, it's fine. I got it. All right. - Ryan! Ryan! - What? Whoa, what happened? I just saw Keith. - Ryan, just go, okay? - What... what happened? Just go, Ryan! Just start the car and let's go! - Ryan! Ryan! - What're you doing? - He's trying to kill us! - Get off of me! - Ryan, Ryan, Ryan! - Stop it! Get off! Ah! Ow! I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ow! What... what... Wh- I'm sorry. There's somebody outside of the car, and I know this sounds crazy, - but I really think... - Stop it! - it's Keith. - We just need to get home. Okay? We'll just get home, and we'll be all... all better. Come on! Nine-one-one emergency. Hello? Hello? Hey, hey, I'm- I'm stuck in the snow. Hello? You're stranded? Look, we really need some help out here. No, no, no, no, no. Who is that? I think he's coming back. Why do you think he's coming back? Baby, are you sure the doors are locked? Hold the doors. Yes, sweetheart, the doors are locked. Sir? Sir, who's in the car with you? Come on! Hel- who- are you there? Sir, who do you have in the car with you? Uh, that's my girlfriend. And, uh, what is she talking about somebody coming back? Look, no- nobody... Look, we just- we may have seen a couple people out here, and we think that they may be trying to hurt us. And why would they want to do that? Well, you know, I think... I... we... we think... that... there- there may have been an accident a while back. And- and- and we think that the other driver, that he might be trying to hurt us. Because you hurt him in the accident? Maybe. But I... I... I don't even know if there was an accident. Have you been drinking? No, no. I haven't had a drop to drink all night long, and neither has my girlfriend. Okay. And exactly where are you? We're- we're- uh, we're- we're- we're near, uh, Deer Tail Road. My girlfriend said she saw a sign that said that said Deer Tail Road. Deer Tail Road. I saw a sign that said Deer Tail Road. I saw... And that's- that should be about a mile and a half from I saw it back there. I don't- Ten-twelve, we got a stranded vehicle in the vicinity of. Yeah, we got a white jeep, license plate three H-E-L five eight one, registered to a Ryan Edward Dunbar. Oh, man, Ryan, I... I haven't seen Ryan since high school. Well, he and his girlfriend are stuck in a ditch out about a mile and a half from twenty-eight seventy-six Montpelier. - 2, 8, 7, 6, Montpelier? - That's right. Did he happen to mention his girlfriend's name? Uh, he didn't, no. Uh, but he said he thought they might have been involved in a hit and run. He thought they might have been? That's right. That's what he said. Um, he thought maybe the other driver was trying to harm them in some way. I don't know. It didn't make a hell of a lotta sense, if you ask me. Oh. What do you want? You're blitzed out of your head, huh? No, I just almost fell over trying to open the damn door. Oh, maybe if you weren't drinking you wouldn't almost be falling. I'm crippled, Larry. Remember? Yeah, in more ways than one. Did you come all the way over here just to insult me? No, but as long as I'm here, I figured I might as well. That's hilarious. You're- you're- you're just a real riot. Well, you used to think so. Well I came to my senses. So if you're here to insult me, just leave. Shelley's stuck in a ditch. What? I heard it on my scanner. Well how do you know it's her? Boyfriend's name is Ryan, right? Oh, that jerk. Don't remind me. Yeah. Well, uh, he called police dispatch, gave your address and everything. And, sounds like they've been in an accident. Uh, with somebody else, I mean. Well, is she okay? I didn't hear anything about any injuries. All I heard was that they're stuck in a ditch. Well, go pull her out. N- you know, the sheriff's on it. I... I... I... I was on my way home. I just thought maybe you'd like to know. Well, Larry, why can't you just go pull her out? Because. I've been working since seven o'clock this morning. I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go home and get a little bit of shut eye. Oh, on a night like this? Bull. You're not gonna go to sleep. There's too much business out there. You know, sheriff's on it. I'm- I'm on my way home. I just thought you might want to know. You're gonna leave my daughter stuck in a ditch to get back at me? Oh, since when do you care about your daughter? Since when do you care about anybody? I care about a lot of people. Fact, there's just one person I don't care about. Always a pleasure, Gayle. Some tow truck driver. Dear God, please keep Shelley safe. Please. Not without protection. I don't want to get pregnant, stuck in this town forever. Are you sure you got the location correct? Because I've been up and down Montpelier two times already. I'm not seeing any stranded white jeep. You wanna get some more guys on this? Yeah, I think we better, yeah. Wanna hit this? Don't mind if I do. Yeah. It's kind of weird that he hasn't come home yet. I hope he's dead. Oh, you don't hope that No, I don't. But you know what, I don't really love him anymore. If you woulda asked me that a month ago, I would have said yeah. But not now. I started seeing someone else. Who? This guy. He really loves me, too. You want to see a picture of him? He is ugly. He is, isn't he? Nine-one-one emergency. Hey, yeah. This is, uh, this is Ryan Dunbar, the guy who's stranded? I know who you are. We've got people out there looking everywhere for you. Well, what's the hold up? We can't find you. Are you sure you gave us the correct location? What's she saying? Uh, yeah- yeah. Wait, what's she saying? Pretty sure. They said they can't find us. Well then, let's just walk. It's not that far. Wait, Ryan, did I hear her say something about walking? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's a very bad idea. It's five below right now. - Doesn't feel that cold. - Well, it is. And I'm not even adding in the wind chill. You- you got your heater running, right? Yeah- yes. It's on. And you got plenty of gas? Full tank. Then just sit tight. We're gonna find you, you know. Don't worry about it. I wish I... I wish I could fall asleep, and wake up in my own bed. You can fall asleep on my shoulder if you want. No, it's not gonna happen. I can't sleep right now. My god. Bruce, how long has it been? A long time. You're working for the sheriff, what do you know about that. Yeah, well, it's been interesting. Do you mind if I come in? Oh, of course. Uh, you're catching me at kind of a weird... Yeah, I know. I've been out looking for her, saw your lights on, thought I'd come by and see if you knew where she might be. Me? Oh, she doesn't call me. You know, she stops by once a day to bring me groceries, or help around the house, but she doesn't call unless she has to. She doesn't really take my calls, either. You know, I honestly think you were pretty lucky, not ending up marrying her. Well, I don't know about that. I do. You know about Keith, don't you? Blew his brains out. About a month ago. She'd already dumped him for that criminal she's running around with. Uh, you mean Ryan? You know about him? Yeah. My mom filled me in. I thought Ryan got married? He did. He did. He left his wife and baby last summer, moved in with some drug addict friend of his who lives out near the flats. They've both had run ins with the law. I had Lynn pull Ryan's record, and... DUl, bar fight, nothing major. I didn't raise Shelley to run around with somebody like that. But oh, no, she loves him to death. She didn't even come to her senses after Keith killed himself. Oh, she was always selfish like that. She wasn't selfish, Gayle. Like hell. You remember what happened the night of my accident? I mean, I'm almost dead in a car wreck, my spine and my legs are crushed, and they- they ask me who should they call, and I said of course call my daughter. And they call her, and she didn't show up at the hospital until nine or ten the next morning. I mean, my god, her own mother, almost dead, and she can't even be bothered to show up at the hospital? That's not true. I was with Shelley that night. And I drove her to the hospital. They wouldn't let her in to see you. We both stayed up all night waiting for you to get out of surgery. It had been me, and Shelley had been in an accident, they would have had to hold me down to keep me from seeing her. She wasn't even that upset when I did see her. Come on, mom. Gotta eat something. We're gonna go to therapy. Oh, what's the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna walk again. That's not true. You just... you gotta have the right attitude. Hon, I'm still gonna be handicapped. I mean, how am I supposed to take care of myself? I wish your grandmother was still alive. And Larry, he's no good. That's not true. Larry loves you. You should marry Larry. He's not gonna marry me. Not now. And you. You're gonna run off to college in a few months and forget all about me. I'm not gonna run off to college, mom. If you need me, I'm gonna be here. Just- don't guilt me into it. Guilt? Sweetie, I'm not trying to guilt you into anything. Well, you know Shelley. She had a lot of plans. I guess that's part of the reason why she broke up with me. I wasn't ambitious enough. That's funny, you're the one that ended up leaving. Well, I'm back now. And to tell you the truth, she's a big part of the reason why. I guess I was kind of hoping that one way or another we'd find our way back to each other. You know, I think you could. You're a deputy now. I mean, you, uh, figure out how to put away this Ryan and I think there could be a little hope. Horizon Unlimited, can I have the name and phone number you're calling from please? This is the Delmore County Sheriff's dept in Meadville, California. We have two people stranded in the snow in sub freezing temperatures, and we can't seem to locate them. Stranded in what? Snow. We got a blizzard here, and I can't find these people, and we wanted to see if there's some way you could help us locate them. They're calling from a number we traced to your company. Can you tell us which cell tower their calls are coming from? Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I can't give that information over the phone. But they're stuck. They could be freezing to death. And I understand that. But we don't know for sure you are who you say you are. So you're going to half to talk to someone in our legal department. Could I please? Well, first you have to talk to my manager. Whatever it takes. Sheriff's department. Uh- uh- just- just a second. Uh, hol- hold on. Can I help you? I'm looking for your roommate, Ryan Dunbar. I don't really know where he is. Do I smell marijuana? Um, this is, uh... I know who she is. Hey Jeanette. Long time. Yeah. Wow. You're a cop now? Yeah, looks like. Is Ryan in any trouble? You might say that. Uh, where's your stash, Wade? Ryan go out and score some more? Is that where he is right now? I don't... really know. Uh... I don't know, there was this party I was supposed to go to... up in Pulaski, What kinda party? Just a... just a party, you know. Some people. This guy Nathon, some friends of his. Yeah, friends of yours too, right Wade? Ah, that can't be good. Think I should call the sheriff's again? Shelley? - What's that? - What? That. It sounds like a party. You don't suppose it's possible that we went in a circle and now we're right back at Nathon's, do you? Wh- maybe. - Ryan, it's them! - Are you su... are you sure? We're back by Nathon's and we didn't even know it. Yes! Who else is having a party on a night like this? Come on! Come on! So then he's, like, I want you to poop on the bed. And I'm, like, what? - You gotta be out of your mind. - Get outta here. No, it's true. He used that word, too. He said poop. Guy must be, like, five years old in the head. Yeah, well, he was, like, sixty in the sack. What a pervert. Are you Nathon? Yeah. It's them. Those guys, those skinheads we saw before. They've got Eliot! No! Wha- wha- wha- they still have Eliot! Come on! I can't seem to locate anyone in our legal department right now. - It is 5 in the morning. - 5 in the... where exactly are you? Florida. Well, maybe you don't understand the seriousness of the situation. We have a thing called snow. Do you know what I mean? All right, there's no need to get snippy. I understand this is an emergency situation, so I'm gonna go ahead and authorize us to give you... the information you need to find those people. Thank you. Him I met a couple of times. I never partied with him, just met him in passing is all. And her? I'm not going to jail, right? I gave you my word. I never saw her before tonight. Hey, everybody. This is, uh, Ryan and Shelley? Where is Wade? He owes me fifty bucks. When did you ever have fifty bucks? I got my ways. Is that coke? Coke? I wouldn't touch that stuff if my life depended on it. Coke is for chicks and queers. Okay. So no coke, huh? Just meth? Are you listening to me? Get off me. Yeah. Yeah, we... we were all doing meth. Crystal meth. The good stuff. Were you snorting it? Smoking it? Both? Well, some people like it one way, some people like it the other. But I don't go near the pipe myself. I don't smoke anything. I respect my body too much. And they were doing it with you? Well, not at first. She was upset. - About what? - How the hell would I know? She wasn't too talkative. Well, not at first. I'm so glad I came! Yeah, god-damn! Hm, hm, I said damn. All right, come here. - Let me~ let me~ let me see that. - Ryan! What? Come on, I just wanna give it a try. There you go. Really quickly, not for you. Come on. It'll be okay. Okay. It's your turn now. I told you to leave that one. I told you to take that one. Jesus. That one. How about giving me that one over here? Come on. ~ You're fuckin' crazy. No more. - Come on. There you go. - Oh, thank you. - Right there. Not too much. Okay. - You're stupid. - Ow. - Alright, well you give it a try. - Yeah, right. - Come on? - Yeah, right. - What? - Yeah, right. - Yeah? Pussy. - You don't want any? Well, I don't... I don't know. Okay, you need to slow down. You're doing too much. Hm. Oh, yeah. Oh! Look what you did. You're crazy. - Come on, just... just a little. - No. Just a little bit. Oh! Get out of the way! Okay. I'll get out of the way. Okay. Professional is in the house. No. Yeah, right. Whatever. - Okay, do the knife thing, or whatever. - Come on, do the knife thing. Do the knife thing. Just do it. - Okay, little one. - I'm doing a little one. Little girl one. Little girl one. - A little girl one. A little girl one. - I'm doing a very little, here you go. - This looks so dirty right now. - Go ahead. Oh! - It burns! - You.. you missed about half of it. There you go. There you go. There, I finally did it. You... almost. All right, do it again. You're wasted. Wasted. I'm not gonna... I'm really hot right now. She's wasted. All right. You're so awful. Oh my god. See? See? Well, that was it, you know? Once he did a little, he started doing a lot. What do you mean a lot? I mean a lot, for two. Really smoothed her out, too. She started getting real friendly. Used to always tell me, but I never believed them because I never thought I was pretty enough. But, dude, they used to always say that. High five. Yes. Yes. That's right. That's mine. - I know this is you... - That's mine. Um... I was gonna go to the art studio, did you know this? You didn't even know this. I was gonna go take acting class when I went down to college, but then I never went to college, I never took acting class. But you know what? I'm totally gonna go down to L.A., and I'm totally gonna try to do the whole... the whole acting, carpet magazine thing, because, like, hi, hi, I could totally do it. I think you could. I think you would be a great actress. I do. I know, right? I know. This talent is going to waste, you know what I'm saying? This talent, ready to blow up. Screw it. - Let's make out. - Yeah. I mean, I'm a first rate mechanic, man. You give me something electrical that's broken, I'm gonna put that sucker back together in no time. Swear. I'll prove it to you. You give me something right now. Give me your toaster. You got a toaster? You give me your toaster, I will take that sucker apart and I will put it back together, and you won't believe how god-damned good that toast tastes. Seriously. Seriously. I swear, man. Seriously. - My toaster's fine. - I'm hot in here. Mmm, snookums. Angel cheeks. You're so pretty. You're pretty. You're pretty. You're pretty. You're pretty. Hey, it's snowing like hell. Why is it snowing so damn much? Global warming. Beautiful, isn't it? Stop it. And it was your impression that she'd never done it before? That's how it looked to me. Him too. So why didn't you warn them? Warn them about what? All right, I told you, let me be alone. Jeez. Well, you must have known that they were doing too much. You definitely knew that there was a blizzard outside. So why didn't you tell them not to leave? Well, I tried. We all did. But they wouldn't listen. So we just packed them a little something for the road and off they went. You mean that you gave them some more? We figured it was a friendly thing to do. Nine-one-one emergency. They got my kid. I'm sorry? The skinheads. They're torturing people. They almost got me and Shelley. Ryan, is that you? I can barely hear you. You gotta speak up. Okay. They might hear me. Who might hear you? The skinheads. They're all around us. You mean all around the truck? No. We're not in the truck. Ryan, you're not outside, are you? You can't be outside. You'll freeze to death. We can't move. They have us trapped. Ryan, listen to me very carefully. Nobody's got you trapped. You're imagining things. No. No. No. No, no, we saw them. They were- they were torturing people. They almost got Shelley. Where is Shelley? Can I speak to Shelley please? Shh. Hey. Hey. They want to talk to you. You think you can? Okay. Hello? Shelley. You guys have got to get back in the truck and stay there. Do you understand? We spoke to Ryan's cell phone company. It looks like he's got his GPS turned off. Wh- I don't- what? What? GPS. Help the cell phone company trace... Please, send somebody to get us. Cold. Please. Skinheads? That's what they said. But they promised they would get back inside the truck and stay there. Who'd you speak to, him or her? Both. How'd she sound? Pretty coherent, considering how much she's done. Shelley? It's me. I got bad news. Shelley's on drugs and she's running around outside in the snow. It's not there! Someone took my car away. Are you sure that's where it was? Yeah, yeah, pretty sure. They must have dragged it out of the ditch and taken it away. Larry? - What was that? - What? What? Shelley, are you out here? Answer me! Mom, you... What in the world do you think you're doing? I've been worried half to death. Mom, you can walk! Well, of course I'm walking fine. I always could. I was gonna walk right out of this town, but then I got pregnant with you, and... You were faking to keep me here this whole time? Well, you kept me here. You think I've never had any dreams of my own? So why shouldn't I strand you the way you stranded me? You bitch! I'll kill you! No, Shelley! Shelley, relax! Hey! Hey! It's me! Who were you talking to? - My mother. - What? Ryan, she lied. Calm down. Hey, hey! I think I found the car. It's right over there. It's gonna be okay. All right? I've got them. I've got the truck. Shelley! Shelley! That's not your car. You think anybody lives here? Would you? Hello in there! Hello? Hello? Come on. Oh... Whoa. It's a kitchen. Yeah. Come on. Help me out. Give me your, uh, your lighter. Yeah. Hold on. Ryan, I can't find it. Oh, come on, don't tell me you lost it. Didn't you see me with it? Ha. There. Come on, turn. Maybe it's. Damnit. It's okay. What is it? It's about time. - Is Eliot okay? Is he there with you? - Eliot? Since when did you ever give a damn about Eliot? Come on, is he there with you or not? Yes, of course. And do you know where we are? Your place. Hey, you wouldn't answer your phone so I came over looking for you. And you'll never guess who stopped up. - Who? - Bruce Davis, that's who. And he's a deputy sheriff now. - And he arrested Wade. - What for? Possession. I thought he was gonna arrest me too, but he didn't. But he is gonna haul your ass in as soon as they find you. What- what- wait- wait- what- what for? What did I do? Well, it's your trailer too, right? You're both going down for possession, and I couldn't be happier. Hello? Hello? Ryan, I know you did not just hang up on me. I'm in trouble. Wh- why? What do you mean? I'm not getting any answer. The phone's gone dead? Well, it's ringing, and usually when a phone goes dead it goes straight to voice mail. And he never turned on his GPS? I'll check again with his cell phone company, but no, I don't think he ever did. Ready? Yeah. I- I really appreciate this, Larry. Know. You know what? We're gonna find her. Okay. Mm. You want some? Well, I am. May as well. I'm going to jail anyway. No. I'm not gonna let them take you somewhere I can't be with you. You really do love me, don't you? You have to ask? I guess a small part of me never believed it. I mean, come on, you're just so perfect, and I'm- I'm a screw up. I am so not perfect. That was the problem with me and Keith, you know? He was perfect. I was just bored. I needed trouble, Ryan Dunbar. Trouble? I gave you that. Oh, trouble's not the right word. I needed excitement, you know? Something, anything, just to feel alive. Yeah, tell me about it. Why can't they just leave us alone? You know? I love you, you love me, should be simple, right? But no. Ever since we go together they've been trying to break us up. I mean, marriages break up. What's the big deal? Especially if they're mistakes to begin with. Exactly. Why can't they just live their lives and let us be happy? They're jealous. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Of what? Because you and I haven't given up, like they have. Is that the sheriff? That's gotta be the sheriff. Ryan, we have to answer that. Hello? Shelley? Thank god, I thought you were dead. You're not taking Ryan away from me. Nobody said they were. I swear, just tell me where you are. Tell me that you're someplace safe, inside. We're... we're out in those camps, where people take their kids out in the country. - Inside? - Yeah. But there's no heat. There's a fireplace, but we can't get a fire started. That's all she said, they're in a camp? There's at least ten of those places in this county alone. Well, she also said there was a van outside. Does that help at all? Not really. They can't have gotten that far on foot, and the truck is... where'd you find it again? Meridian Way. Out. - You heard that, right? - Yep. Hang on. We're not gonna get stuck, are we? Don't worry about it. Frank Vannick. What? Do you remember Frank Vannick? He... the guy who used to be the bartender at The Red Line a few years back? - He's bald, kinda stocky? - Used to come on to you quite a bit? Yeah, he did. And you used to encourage him? No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. Uh, can we not get into this? Did you sleep with him? No, but I think he had a van. Didn't he? I have no idea. No, remember? He had a van. It used to break down all the time. I think he got a job out at Camp Castanoan, and he was a caretaker or something. How... how many times did you sleep with him? I didn't sleep with him. But I think that's where they are. I bet they're at Camp Castanoan. Can I use your phone? Why, so you can call him? No, smart ass, so I can call the sheriff. What was that? Let me see. No, no, no, no, just stay there. Stay there. We're surrounded! We gotta get out of here! Come on! Oh, no. Oh! Freeze! You're under arrest. Bruce! Hush. Bruce, oh my god, I'm so glad to see you. Shot! Ryan, baby, baby! Baby! No. No. No. Look, you see? You see what you did to me? No. No. No! Shelley! Hey! Come on! What? oh! No! Did to me! No! Ryan! Ryan! Look, you see? - Did you find her? - No. They were here, but they're not here now. - Oh my god. Oh my god. - Don't panic. She's been drinking. Shut up! My daughter's gonna freeze to death and you're giving me crap about drinking? Geez, why would they leave? I don't know, but they're on foot so they couldn't have gotten far. Yeah. This is all my fault. You know, you're really not helping, Gayle. You have no idea what I'm going through. I know better than you do, Gayle. You know what else? This is your fault. She wouldn't be in this mess if she'd stayed with me. You were the one that came between me and Shelley. You did everything you could to break us up. You did everything you could. Sorry. I like that kid. Give me a second. Just give me a second. - I'm burning up. - I'm suddenly... so tired. Have no choice. - You lied to us. - I'm sorry? You said you weren't gonna arrest me, but you are. You're with them. With who? The skinheads, my wife, Bruce, you're all in this together. - Ryan, listen to me. - No! You listen to me. We do not need your help anymore. We'll find our way out ourselves. Ryan, please, we're just trying to get the state to send us out... Don't call anymore. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, come on. No, Ryan. I wanna sleep. I wanna sleep. I know. I do, okay? We can't sleep. They're gonna find us. - No. - Just a little longer. Come on. - Ryan, there's snow up here. There's sno~ - Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I got you. Just... Okay. Just trust me. I'll get you out of here. Come on. Come on. Just help me out. Stand up. Almost done. He's right, you know. Who's right? Bruce. I did come between him and Shelley. I'm the one who set her up with Keith. Yeah, I remember. Never quite understand that one. I mean, Keith was a... well, let's just say he wasn't exactly gonna set the world on fire. Exactly. He wasn't going anywhere. Just a small town boy, you know? But with Bruce, Shelley had him wrapped around her little finger, and I... guess I was afraid one day she'd talk him into leaving. So yeah, I did everything I could to break them up. You're that scared of losing her. She's all I have. Well, you still have her. I hope. You had me too, you know. I loved you, Gayle. Guess in a kind of strange way, I still do. But you threw me away. You didn't want to be with me. Not after the accident. That's a lie and you know it. It didn't matter to me. I would have stayed with you no matter what. I know. So then why? Shelley. As long as I had you, she knew she could leave. You know, I had someone to take care of me. If I didn't have you... Then she'd have to stick around. That's how badly I wanted to hang on to her. I've never admitted this to anyone. Maybe... probably not even myself. But, after the accident, I think I new I'd found a way to keep her with me. I always figured that's what happened. I'm sorry. Well, it stopped snowing. Rest ye merry cheating wives, and nothing you dismay. For that won't be a problem... if you never would have strayed. Look out! I'm looking! I'm... I'm... I'm looking. No, you're not. You're exhausted. Come on, we're getting loaded up on coffee. Yeah? Your place or mine? Neither. I'm so hot. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Okay. Okay. Ryan? Hey. Ryan? Will you marry me? Of course. Of course. No, I mean now. We don't need anybody to tell us we're married, just as long as we believe it. Then... then we're married. Okay. Come on. Okay. - I don't wanna die here... - Come on. What? No. No, you're not gonna die. You're not gonna die. But I'll die a married woman. Wait! Oh! Come on. Come on. Hold... hold on. Hey! Hey, look! Look, it's a house! You see it? Oh, we're saved! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan. We don't know who's in that house, okay? They could be waiting for us. They could be waiting to kill us. No. No. I'm gonna go check it out. I'm gonna check it out. And- and- and when I come back, - if it's safe I'm gonna get you. - What? No, just... give me your phone, and, and call me if it's safe. Okay. Lynn, what's happening? We spoke to state. We might be able to get some search and rescue teams out there in about an hour. An hour? They can't get anybody sooner than that? I tried to get them sooner. That's the best they could do. And Shelley hasn't called you? I think they turned their phones off again. They haven't picked up the last few times I called. What's the number? Ow. Oh. Oh. No. Ryan! Is it safe? Shelley, it's Bruce. Oh. Why're you calling Ryan's phone? I can't... I can't wait... I can't tell you... how happy I am to hear your voice, Shelley. Where are you? I'm... I'm... um, we found a house, and I'm waiting for Ryan to see if it's safe. He left you there alone? He had to. There are all these people chasing after us, Bruce. He's the one that you need to worry about. You would not be in this position if it wasn't for him. You don't know what you're talking about. No, I know that I love you, Shelley. I know that I've always loved you. I thought that if I went away, that I'd stop thinking about you. But I never did. And I've been looking for you for a long time before tonight. It's too late. It's not too late. I'm gonna find you. I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna take care of you. Whatever you want me to be, I'll be. You want to leave this place, then we'll leave. I'm not going anywhere without Ryan. But you deserve so much better than that! Few years ago you wouldn't have gone near him. I was a different person then, Bruce. That person died. Everything dies in this town. Ryan brought me back to life again. Shelley! Come here, Shelley! It's okay! There's somebody calling. - Who? - I can't tell. Shelley, it's okay! Ryan's with me. Oh, Bruce, I gotta go. Shelley, stay on the phone! Don't hang up. Just stay with me. It's okay, Ryan's safe. Shelley, don't you understand? He's never gonna be safe. 'Course I know. That's why I love him. Shelley! Come here, Shelley! It's okay! Miranda. It's okay. You're bleeding! It's okay. How's Ryan? Is he safe? Come here. Yeah, he's inside. I was lying in bed, and... oh no! Oh, god. I was lying in bed, and... Poor baby. He walked in, sat down, and a second later he passed out. It's been a long night. Listen to me. We're gonna have to take you to the doctor. No. They'll just call the sheriff. What are you talking about? Are you guys in some kind of trouble? We were, but we're find now. Shelley! Baby. Oh, hey sweetheart. I'll get you a blanket. What are we gonna do? We're gonna rest here a little bit, and then we're gonna leave. We're gonna leave for good, okay? Yeah. And we're always gonna be together. We are.
