Star of Yacov, what they be calling|the Christmas star. Ain't been seen since Bethlehem.|And now it's here. - That's nice.|- Oh, yes. Very nice. It's a good sign|for all good people. Means someone special|come from God. What do you think about that? I don't know. I'm not sure|I believe in that kind of thing. Oh, that don't matter. It's there|if you believe or not believe. It don't care. [Coughing] Merry Christmas. I don't have any change. If you need a place to stay, there's|a shelter right down on Nassau. -Jenna?|- Say hello to your Aunt Maggie. I don't even know|where to start,Jenna. It's been two years. - [ Crying ]|- And a baby. What's his name? - Her name is Cody.|- Cody. She's eight-- Oh, no. She's nine days old. - Can I pick her up?|- She doesn't like to be held, but do what you want. She's soaking wet.|Are you breast feeding? - Who's the father?|- [ Chuckles ] Beats me. - Beats you?|- It means I don't know. It could have been a couple of guys.|I didn't get a name and a number. -Do you have any diapers or formula?|-In the bag. You gave birth on drugs? Are you insane? - Answer me!|- [Cody Crying] What? What do you want me to say?|That I'm not perfect, like you? - I'm not.|- I didn't say I was perfect. But if I had a daughter, I wouldn't|let her be born a drug addict. She's not strung out, okay? I--|[ Sniffles ] I took her to the clinic and|they said it was something else. - What something else?|- I don't know. You have a child. If you don't|give a damn about yourself, at least|you have to care about her! - Why?|- Because you're her mother! Gee. What's wrong, Mags? Are you a little pissed|that maybe there is one thing... I can do better than you after all? - What are you talking about?|- You know. ''Mommy hood.'' Maybe if you could|have carried a kid, that piece-of-shit husband of yours|wouldn't have run out on you. What was it,|two miscarriages, three? [ Sobbing ] Why do you do this,|Jenna? I'm the only family|you've got left. I am the one that|is in trouble here, okay? I came to you for a little help|and all you can do is give me shit! I made a mistake coming here.|I'm leaving. No,Jenna. Don't run away again. I'm so scared, Mags. I don't know|what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna help you, but first you have|to get off the drugs. Okay? [Cody Crying] Hi, you. Where are you going? To take a bath. That's what you always say, right?|''A hot bath will cure anything.'' Why don't we|change your socks? [Clattering] Jenna? Jenna!Jenna! [Cody Crying] Okay, okay. [Continues Crying] Okay. It's okay. [ Laughs ]|Hi. Hi. [ No Audible Dialog ] You're a psychiatric nurse,|Maggie. You know the diagnosis|as well as I do-- the arching back, the repetitive|behavior and the attention deficit. I used to think|it was autism too, but I'm not so sure anymore. It's as if she's listening|to something we can't hear or see. It's a difficult diagnosis|to accept. I know that. But there are a wide range|of degrees of autism. Cody may well be|one of the lucky ones. Reading, writing,|language skills. She may even be able|to express basic emotions. She does.|I know she's a little withdrawn, but she smiles and hugs me and|kisses me just like any little girl. There's a special-needs school|in Brooklyn-- pre through six. They've had great results|with kids like Cody. It's Catholic. I don't know whether|that's any problem for you. No. I was brought up|a Catholic. Just so it's not|too religious. And later, if her condition|gets more severe-- [Woman On TV]|I welcome you with open arms. - It gets better every time.|- I've sponsored your appointment, because I feel you are the most|able statesman in all Freedonia. [Man] That covers a lot of ground.|You cover a lot of ground yourself. Leave in a taxi. If you can't get|a taxi, you can leave in a huff. If that's too soon, you can|leave in a minute and a huff. You haven't stopped talking|since I came here. You must have been vaccinated|with a phonograph needle. [Thudding] - [TV Shuts Off]|- What is it? Cody! Cody! Cody, Cody. It's okay, baby girl.|It's okay, baby girl. It's all right.|It's okay. Just relax.|Take a big, deep breath. Go--|[ Inhales ] - Is she okay?|- Yes. She does this sometimes. Look, I gotta get going.|I've gotta be up early tomorrow. -All right.|-I got a pretty busy week this week, but I'll--|I'll call you... soon. That would be nice. [ Murmuring ]|Don't leave in a huff. - [Door Closes]|- Leave in a minute and a huff. Now where is that mouse? Right here? Is that him? I want you to get|some sleep, okay? Okay? Good night, sweetheart. Time to work|on the picture board, Cody. Cody. Cody. - Don't you want to work?|- Please, Sister, after you. Well, thank you, but we're|not working on our manners today. Maybe we should. No work.|Sister Rosa go work. Good-bye. Cody, your aunt is here for you. [ Voice Whispers, Indistinct] [ Voice Whispers, Indistinct] Martin? - Martin Casillas?|- Yeah? Martin, you remember me.|I'm a friend of your father's. You were at my house last year. - You're six, aren't you?|- Yeah. - Good. You like dogs?|- Sure. Well, I found a puppy and I bet he|needs someone to take care of him. Oh, you're probably|too young to have a puppy. - No, I could take care of a dog.|- Yeah? Excellent. Well, he's right|over here in my van. - Wow. Can I have him?|- Maybe. We're looking for a very|special little boy, Martin. If you're the one,|you can have the puppy. - But first you have to pass a test.|- Like what? The boy that we're looking for can|do things that nobody else can do, sort of like magic tricks. - Do you know any tricks, Martin?|- I don't know. Well, maybe we can|help you find out. Bet you that puppy's hungry.|Voila! Here. Why don't you see if he'll|take that from you. Go on. What's the matter?|It's only garbage, honey. Come on. - [Clattering]|- [ Squeaking ] Hey. Hey! It's just little mice, like Mickey Mouse. It's no big deal. [Woman On TV] The body|of six-year-old Tania Riley, the fourth victim|in a series of kidnap murders, was discovered last night near|a residential area in Queens. A statewide search is now|in progress for the killer. Police have yet|to name a suspect... and have opened a 24-hour|hot line for any information... regarding this or any|of the other murders. - [Continues, Indistinct]|- Hey. Hey, hey. Let's put the dolly|in the car. Hi, Maria. I'm really late.|I've gotta run to work. Okay. It's bedtime,|mi angelito. On. For Teddy. Oh, okay.|But just for Teddy. Your mommy's|very pretty, yes? Did you pray for her? Oh, Cody. You know this.|I tell you this. You pray to the baby Jesus|for your mommy, and one day she will|come back to you. Not coming, Mommy.|Not come. I'm sorry, corazon. I'm sorry, corazon. You pray. You see. Who knows, okay? Buenasnoches, mi angelito. Buenas noches, mi angelito. [Applause On TV] [Woman]|Again, our guest today, Eric Stark. You probably remember him as Little|Luke, the child star of Family Days. Today he's here to talk about|his work as founder of The New Dawn, one of the fastest-growing|self-help organizations in America. Honey, you have|five minutes. - Then you have to go get dressed.|- ...an addict by 15. There were even rumors at one point|that you had died from an overdose. [Scraping] But now you're helping|these runaway kids. You're helping the abused kids.|You're getting them off the streets. You're getting them off drugs|and into your rehab centers. - What's your secret?|- [Turns Down] These kids are|tortured with morality. They feel terribly guilty|and they want to forget. So what we try to do at New Dawn... is teach these kids to look|inside themselves-- [TV Continues, Indistinct] [Scraping] [Mouse Squeaks] [Faint Hissing, Whispering] [Whispering Continues] [ Gasps ] [ Voice Whispers, Indistinct] [ Chattering ] That's your guy. - I'm looking for Detective Bugatti.|- Yeah, that's me. - Agent Travis?|- How you doing? Welcome to Brooklyn. I'll get you up|to speed on all this stuff later. But... maybe it would be|a good idea... if you try to keep|a low profile out here today. - Why is that?|- Well, some of the guys, they're wound up pretty|tight about this case. They should be. This is the fifth child|and from what I heard, you still don't have any suspects. That's true, but|some of the detectives, they get a little territorial|when the bureau steps in. That would include you? Hey, I don't give a fuck|if we gotta call in... the French Foreign Legion if that's|what it takes to stop this guy. - Mind if I take a look at the body?|- Yeah, no, go ahead. - Hi, Cody.|- Hi. Those are very pretty.|Who are they? [ Gasps ] Must be that poor bird. It flew|into a window and broke its neck. They're all quite|curious about death. Do you think|they understand death? You'd be surprised.|I blame The Lion King. Sister Rosa,|would you mind? Cody fixed the bird!|Cody fixed the bird! Maybe he was just knocked out|when he hit the window. No, he was dead. [ All ] Cody fixed the bird!|Cody fixed the bird! - I'm tired, Mim.|- Okay, sweetie. We'll go home. [Woman]|Thanks for staying. - Sure.|- Must be a full moon tonight. Helen got cut by a paranoid ''schiz''|with a razor blade. - And there's a biter in four.|- Terrific. And a recovering O.D.|in three seeing snow lights. If you'll take the histories. - No problem.|- Thanks. - Cheri Post?|- Who are you? I'm Maggie.|Wanna tell me what's wrong? What do you think is wrong? I'm|sketching, you know, coming down. Wanna lie down for me? - Your name is O'Connor?|- Mm-hmm. I don't care about your tracks.|I want to help you. I just need a blood sample. Some friends shot me up. Wanted me to end up|in the morgue instead of here. Why would they do that? [ Chuckles ] They don't like|people quitting their club. Nice club. Just relax. You're really nice|for a nurse. Okay.|Put some pressure on that. You kind of look like her. Who? Make it good.|I need a boost. Jenna. My sister.|You know my sister? No, a friend of mine,Janet. No, no, no.|You said Jenna. - Where is she?|- I don't-- I haven't seen her in six years.|I've looked for her everywhere. She has a little girl|she hasn't even seen. I know she has a little girl. She's special. You know that,|don't you? That's why they want her. Please tell me|where my sister is. Forget about your sister, okay?|They've already got her. Don't let them get|the little girl. - [Door Opens]|- Maggie, I need you in four. - Doctor--|- Right now! Stay here. Task force hot line.|Can I help you? Please, ma'am, slow down. What makes you think that|your landlord is the killer? [Chatter Continues,|Indistinct] Crawford, I hate to break it|to you, but that weed's been dead|for at least two weeks. Excuse me. - What is that?|- It's a lily. - Really.|- Yeah, it just needs a little sun, and you get sun|through both windows. I hope you don't mind.|My daughter gave it to me. No, it's okay. Good. Don't let Crawford bug you. He's a little soft around the edges,|but he's a good cop. Oh, leave that there.|It's all right. A little ambiance. Can I ask you|a personal question? Depends on the question. There's a rumor going around|that before you were in the bureau, that you were some kind of priest|or something. I was a seminary student. I didn't|make it as far as the priesthood. Still, that is some kind|of makeover. What happened? Found another way|to fight him. - You ready?|- Yeah. Fight who? Gentlemen, ladies. Listen up, please. Most of you have met|Special Agent John Travis. For those who haven't,|he's on loan to us... from the FBI Behavioral Sciences|Division at Quantico. Agent Travis's area of expertise|is ritual homicide... and occult-related crime. He was instrumental in breaking|the Santeria case last summer. No offense, but didn't that|case just end in an acquittal? [ Laughter ] That's right. The problem with prosecuting|occult crime... is the judicial concept|of reasonable doubt. The motives can be so bizarre,|so far beyond reason, that they're hard|for a jury to accept. That means we have to work|twice as hard to get a conviction. But our perp could just be|some run-of-the-mill psycho... who gets his stuff|off the back of a comic book. I don't think so. Whoever did this has a background|in classic occult mysticism. This symbol was used|in ceremonial sacrifice... as far back|as 16th century Europe. The tines on the trident|point left, signifying the left-hand path|of Satanists. It was a sign of a sect|of Luciferians... who took the fallen angel|mythology literally. Then you think|the perp's got motives... - besides thrill kills?|- Yes. The crimes were meant|to be against God, not men. But all I can give you|right now is a time frame. All of the victims' bodies|also had these symbols... branded on them--|Pascua Negra. The translation would be|''Black Easter.'' Whatever our man is up to|will happen on Easter eve. That's only about a week away.|Maybe this is almost over. Or maybe in our perp's mind|that's when it really begins. No, last night. I had just taken a blood sample|when she ran off. How could her|paperwork disappear? I just need her name.|All right, thanks. [Rustling] [Cody]|Mim! [Screaming]|Mim! [ Hissing, Squealing ] Mim! Mim! [Stops] [Cody]|Mim! Cody. Cody. It's okay.|It's okay. - Bad dream.|- Yeah, me too. Me too. You try to go|to sleep, okay? Okay? Buenas noches, mi angelito. I think I'll take Cody shopping|today. It's so beautiful outside. Okay. I'll just|finish this and go home. Maria, are you|missing your rosary? No. Why? Because I found it|under Cody's pillow last night. Oh, she asked me for it. It makes her feel better. -I have an extra one if you want it.|-No, thank you. I'll bring it for you|just in case. Cody, you ready to go|shopping with your Mim? What? - Is that Maria's church?|- Yes. Can we go? Okay, let's go. I'm going to say a little prayer,|like Maria does, okay? Cody? [ Candles Rattling ] [Rattling Stops] She's sad, Mim. So sad. She's crying for us. It's okay.|It's okay. - Nice limo you got there.|- You won the lottery? - Miss O'Connor?|- Yes. Honey. Hello, Mags. Hi, Cody. Do you have a kiss|for Mommy, hmm? Come here. I'm Eric Stark, Maggie, Jenna's husband. We just got back|from Barbados last week. Part honeymoon,|part healing process for Jenna. And no more bad habits-- - except for spending Eric's money.|- Mm-hmm. He saved my life. - Are you a doctor?|- He's Eric Stark, Maggie. The New Dawn,|the foundation, the seminars. Did you meet Jenna through|your work, Mr. Stark? Eric, please. Yeah, we met|at one of my outreach centers. - When was it, only last month?|- [Jenna Giggling] - Isn't that amazing?|- Crazy. So this is all happening|very quickly. Oh, yeah.|I don't waste time anymore. I wasted half my life on drugs.|That was enough. No more.|No more presents. Um. There's still something|wrong with her, isn't there? -I was hoped she would outgrow this.|-She's fine. Just a little different.|And she certainly isn't deaf. You know, I'm a little bit|in a state of shock here. You must know, Eric,|that I haven't seen my sister... since the first week|Cody was born. Well, I'm here now,|and I'm healthy. And everything's going to be fine,|isn't it, sweetie? We'll get you well. - Do you have a kiss for Mommy, hmm?|- No. She has to get used to you.|That will take time. Mm-hmm. Like round-the-clock time, huh? - Cody?|- Well, that's why we're here. You're gonna come live|with Eric and me, Cody. - We're gonna take you home.|- Darling? Why don't you have Dahnia|come up from the limo? - Maybe Cody would like to meet her.|- We have a wonderful nanny. Cody, go in my room|and watch cartoons, okay, sweetie? - [Dialing Phone]|- Hi. Could you send Dahnia up now? Jenna, I don't think|you understand. - Cody's very special.|- You just said she was fine. Yes, but she probably|has a form of autism. -I want the right people to see her.|-She's with the right people. It's taken a lot of work|to bring her to this point. A change could|undo everything. Mags, Eric and I talked about this.|She's my daughter. And it's sort of like-- It's not really up to you. Who do you think raised her when you|left her like a piece of luggage? Who paid for her doctors|and her schools and her test? That gives me some say|what happens to her. Of course it does, Maggie. We're grateful that you took care|of Cody when Jenna wasn't able to, but now she is. And I have the money to give her... the kind of special care|and schooling she needs. Now that you're here,|I want you both to be in her life. She's made so much progress,|but what she needs right now... are rules and stability|and familiar faces. are rules and stability|and familiar faces. Then the sooner she gets|familiar with us, the better. - [Knock On Door]|- Ah, Dahnia. This is Dahnia, Mags.|She's wonderful with children. Hello, Miss O'Connor.|May I see the child? - No, you can't.|- As you wish. Maggie, really there's|no reason to be so defensive. We want you to be part of the family|and visit Cody regularly. This is crazy. It's too soon.|I have to talk to Cody. - No. There's nothing to talk about.|-Jenna, please. Well, I think|this visit is over. Jenna, why don't you|wait in the car? Maggie, I want you to think|this through carefully. Jenna and l, we only|want what's best for Cody. You don't know her yet. She doesn't|know you. This will take time. I'm afraid you don't|have that luxury. You're gonna have to decide|right now, today, how you're going to deal with this. And I promise you, you do not|want this in some court's hands... for your own good--|and for Cody's. Good-bye, Maggie. - Cody?|- [Cartoon On TV] Cody? Cody. [Hissing, Whispering,|Indistinct] Cody! [Tires Screeching] No! - He grabbed her out of my bedroom!|- Calm down. No, I won't calm down. I won't|leave here until somebody helps me. Excuse me, miss.|How old is your child? Six years old. - It's her niece actually.|- Can I take a look at that? Yeah. Anyway, the kid's not really|missing. It's a custody dispute. We should probably|give it to Social Services. Eric Stark is involved in this?|Have you talked to this guy? - No.|- I tried. His number is unlisted... and the foundation|just gave me the runaround. - Want me to find a number on him?|- Yeah, thanks. I'd like to talk to Miss O'Connor|for a few minutes. Please, come this way. I'll be honest with you,|Miss O'Connor, Stark's organization has been|under investigation before. For what? Harboring runaways. There were allegations|of tax fraud... and money laundering,|but nothing that would stick. Please, sit down. See, Stark is well|protected politically... and he keeps a pack of high-priced|lawyers in attack mode year round. Are you saying|you're scared of him? All I'm saying|is that he'll bury you... if you come|after him without grounds. Are those|the serial murders? I'm advising a task force here|that's handling that investigation. But you don't think this|has anything to do with-- No, but I do think... that what my charmless colleague|told you before is probably true. Right now the best thing|for you to do... is try to establish|some form of legal custody. - You need a lawyer, not a cop.|- So that's it? ''Get a lawyer''? That's all the help|you have to offer me? No, you have my word.|I will follow up on Stark. It'll be my pleasure.|I think his whole outfit stinks. But I want you to promise me|if you reach him first-- I would just feel better|if you give me a call... before you even talk to this guy. That will be my first priority,|Agent, making you feel better. Miss O'Connor.|Miss O'Connor. The only thing I can get on Stark|is the number for his lawyer. - [Door Shuts]|- No, thanks. I want to follow up|on this one. - [ Chuckling ] Yeah, right.|- What's that supposed to mean? Come on. The one lead|you're gonna follow up on... is attached to a piece of tail|like that? No wonder this priest|thing didn't work out. This may be|the best lead we've got. Take a look, Frank.|December 16, 1993. The same birthday|as every kid on that board. May I help you? I really don't know much|about your program and-- Would you like a tour? Our main focus has been our national|youth crusade, but our programs... for adults have been gaining more|and more popularity. Our self-realization seminars|only require a $400 donation. What I'm really interested in|is speaking with Eric Stark. His schedule doesn't allow|for personal interviews, but I'll take you|to our computer lounge... and you can e-mail him directly. Before I found New Dawn, I didn't|have any respect for myself. I didn't think|I mattered to anybody. And Eric helped me learn|to will what I do... and to stop letting|others judge me. [ Man ]|Eric helps you tap into this power. I mean, he changed|my whole life. [Thunder Rumbling] [Answering Machine Beeps] Maggie, this is Cheri Post. I got|your number from the hospital. I know where the kid is. Meet me at the diner|at Stanton and Essex at midnight. Do me a favor.|Bring some cash, okay? This is all you brought?|I can't get out of the city on this. Cheri, where is she? Literally?|Of course not. Well, Eric does-- and so do|the sick fucks that are in with him. So would you if you'd|seen what I've seen. - Like what?|- Eric's got this religion, only it's more like|the opposite of religion. I thought it was all bullshit|at first, but I've seen it work. They can predict|the future, even make things happen|to people, bad things. What does this|have to do with Cody? About a year ago, they all started|acting a lot weirder than usual. They started hunting down kids-- six-year-old kids, boys, girls. But they all had to be born|on this certain date. They'd take each kid|and put them through this test, and if they failed,|they'd kill them. ''The slaughter of the innocents,''|they called it. Only Cody isn't like|the other ones. She's the one they've|been looking for all along. So instead of killing her,|Eric's gonna try to change her-- to make her just like him. See? So he can use her power. She's just a little girl. She's more than that,|at least she's gonna be. Gonna be what? I don't know.|A saint, a prophet. She's gonna lead people to God,|Maggie-- a lot of people-- only Eric|won't let that happen. If he can't turn her,|he'll kill her. - Cheri, where is she?|- [Thunder Rumbling] Do you promise|to get her out of there? - Yes.|- You're gonna need this. [Thunderclap] [Man Laughs] Hello. Hello? [ Screaming ] [ Shrieks ] Cheri. [ Screaming ] Come in. Crazy people|like an audience. Is that a self-diagnosis? No, just|a popular theory. I had a half a dozen transit|cops here this morning. They think the concussion makes me|a less-than-credible witness. They're having a hard time believing|you because they didn't find a body. - You lied to me.|- Excuse me? You think what's happened to Cody|is connected with the murders. How many children are dead? Five, that we know of. ''Slaughter of the innocents.''|Does that ring a bell? - Where did you hear that?|- From the girl they killed. - What did she mean?|- Well, it's from the Bible. When the three wise men|told King Herod... that the star over Bethlehem... was the sign that|the Son of God had been born, Herod sent his soldiers|to kill all of the children... that were born on that date. But then an angel appeared|before Mary and Joseph... and warned them to escape. And what date|are our innocents born on? - December 16, '93.|- You son of a bitch. - It's different with Cody.|- You should have told me! It's different with Cody.|We know who took her. And you haven't done|anything about it. Have you even found where|he's keeping her? Maggie, his organization owns... dozens of different properties|all around the country. He lives like a textbook paranoid.|He keeps moving all the time. You could put out a warrant. Come on, Maggie.|You don't think I want this guy? I do. But if I make a move without|grounds, it'll blow the whole case. And there won't be|a second chance here-- not for you,|not for Cody. That's a composite|that we got of the killer... from two very strong eyewitnesses. - Do you recognize him?|- No. - But Eric could still be involved.|- Yeah, it's possible. How many children have been killed|since Cody disappeared? None. I'm going to help you,|Maggie. I'm gonna make a request to have|an officer outside the door... - for the next couple of days, okay?|- Okay. There is one other thing. The hospital said|that they found this on you. Those kids tried to kill me|last night. I wish I had used it. Well, you didn't|get that from me. Lord, I could use|a little help here. [Rustling] Oh, sorry.|You all alone in here? - Yeah.|- Look, if I'm disturbing you-- No, that's okay.|I'm done for tonight. Oh, man. - I don't know how you do this.|- What? This kind of work.|Day after day. It's gotta wear down|a man's spirit. The worst thing is knowing|that he's still out there. And we're running out of time. You'll catch him. - I got a good feeling about this.|- You do, huh? You're wrong|about one thing though. What's that? You're not working|alone tonight. A good man is never|alone in this world. I'm sorry.|Can't you tell me who she is? [ Chattering, Indistinct ] Hey, how about|watching my car? [Whispering, Indistinct] [ Shrieking ] - [ Squawking ]|- [ Chittering ] [Clanking] Hello? Jenna, it's Maggie. [Footsteps] Maggie, if Eric|finds you here-- Do you have any idea|who this man is? - Maggie, I'm begging you.|- Cody. Cody. Cody, hi.|Hi! - Cody miss Mim.|- I missed you. Are you all right? Cody go|to dentist tomorrow. Tell 'em don't make|Cody go to dentist. No. How would you like|to get up right now and leave? - What do you think you're doing?|- I'm taking Cody. - And I want you to come with us.|- No. No, Maggie. No. Maggie, I've watched him|with her. He's very gentle. Maggie. What a surprise.|You should've called. Unfortunately, it's almost time|for Cody's nap. Come here, Cody. Sit down, Maggie. It's all right, Jenna.|It's okay. Actually, uh, - I'm a little tired myself.|- [Eric]No! Stay. We'll have drinks.|Stuart! Stuart! I think Maggie'd|like a drink. Oh--|Unless you have to run. No. I'll stay. I don't care|for a drink. I've been trying to reach you|for the last couple of days, and I really don't|understand why-- There are certain forces|in this country, Maggie, that don't want me empowering|the younger generation. I have to protect my privacy|and my family any way I can. Well, the reason|I dropped by is, um, they're having an Easter egg|hunt at Cody's old school. And I thought it would|be really fun if we went. - Why don't you run get your coat?|- Actually, Maggie, things have changed|since last time we spoke. Originally, we'd hoped some kind|of visitation might be worked out, but your attitude|has made that impossible. [ Sighs ]|I knew you wouldn't give her up... without getting|something in return. - You have nothing I want.|- How about my silence? - Go on.|- I'm no fool, Eric. I didn't imagine what|happened to Cheri. - I know she's dead.|- No one's saying you're a fool. It's just obvious you're not well.|[ Chuckles ] So, I'm scared.|You've accomplished that. But I'm not likely to make a deal|and break it the way she did, am I? You let me take Cody and Jenna|and leave right now, and that's it--|it's over. You can go on with your|mission or your religion... or whatever it is, and you'll|never hear from us again. Maggie, I'm not leaving.|There's nothing bad going on here. We are taking|very good care of Cody. Eric gives her|everything she needs. - He married you to get to her.|- You are jealous. You are jealous because I finally|have a family and you don't! Maggie, this is exactly why|I didn't want you here. Dahnia,|take Cody upstairs! I've never fired|a gun before, but I'll bet|at this range I'm dead on. Don't! Are you really gonna|shoot me, Maggie? [ Chuckles ]|Right here, in front of Cody? Close your eyes, sweetheart. Go ahead|and fire, Maggie. [ Whispering ]|Feel that hate. Feel it?|Feels good, doesn't it? Something that feels|that good... can't be wrong. [ Hammer Clicking ] [ Panicked Breathing ]|Oh, my God. Oh-- Thou... shalt...|not... kill. - Especially without bullets.|- [Bullets Clattering] I know. You're confused,|aren't you? - [ Whimpers ]|- Concussions are tricky, huh? They can mess|with your perceptions. Police start saying|you're seeing things. Maybe you are. - Oh.|- Here. - Oh.|- Here. I wouldn't want|you to hurt yourself. You know what? On second thought, I think I will take|your silence after all. [ Muffled Cries ] Mim! Mim! -[ Gasps ]|-[ Horns Blaring, Tires Screeching ] - [ Tires Screeching ]|- [ Pedal Thumping ] [ Hissing ] [Metal Groaning, Breaking] [Metal Creaking] [Gasping] - [ Horns Honking ]|- [ Onlookers Clamoring ] You've got to get out.|Take my hand. [ Metal Scraping ] [Metal Groaning] [Sirens Wailing] [People Chattering] [ Ringing ] - Agent Travis.|- It's Maggie. What the hell happened to you?|We thought you were dead. We've got witnesses that saw|your car go into the river. -Someone helped me. No one saw that?|-I guess not. And lucky for you.|If the cops found you at the scene, you'd be in a cell right now. There'd be a warrant|out for hit-and-run... - if they knew you were alive.|- It was Stark and his people. - I went there to get Cody.|- You what? - How did you manage--|- They drugged me. I don't know how, but I woke up|right before the crash. You do believe me,|don't you? Maggie, I want you|to turn yourself in to me. At least you'll be safe until|we can build a case against Stark. You gotta trust me right now.|Trust me. - You want me to be safe?|- Yes, I do. Then don't tell|anybody I'm alive. - Maggie, don't-don't--|- [ Dial Tone ] Cody? Come on. You're not like|ordinary children, Cody. Do you know that? On the night|you were born... a star appeared|in the sky... pointed right|down at you. A star that hadn't|been seen in 2,000 years. Like baby Jesus? You're such a smart girl. - Do you love God, Cody?|- Yes. Well, maybe that's just 'cause|you think you're supposed to. I'm gonna teach you|something tonight. Something I think|you're smart enough to understand. [Muttering]|No. no. No, no. Shoo. Uh-uh. Sh-- - Look at this man.|- [Muttering Continues] - He should be in an institution.|- No, no. No, no. Shoo.|Uh-uh. Go away! But God abandoned him,|didn't He? Left him here to suffer. - Death... would be a kinder fate.|- Shoo-shoo! - Even a cruel death.|- [ Muttering ] Through the power|of the one I serve, I can give him the strength|to end his pain. [ Speaking Foreign Language ] - [Continues]|- [Stick Scraping] [ Continuing ] Watch. If God loves his children so much,|maybe he'll stop this. Redeem him...|somehow. Or maybe... Or maybe... the release|I've offered him... is his only|true salvation. Eric! [ Whispering ]|He has forgotten you. Th--|Thank you. [ Chuckles ] She will be ours. Dear God, if You really are there,|please help me. Please|help me and Cody. I know what's|happening to you. There's a man|who can help us. Please,|we don't have much time. [Laughter] [Laughter Continues] - Unhh!|- [ Laughing ] - [ Both Grunting ]|- [ Giggling ] -[ Sobbing ]|-Mommy's busy right now, sweetheart. Why don't we go have a...|little talk. Just you and me. Think it's time|for another lesson. I assure you, Father Grissom|understands what you're up against. He was a Jesuit priest, a scholar|who was censured by the Vatican. The Devil's greatest|achievement... is that people don't|believe he exists. Nowadays the concept of evil|is politically incorrect. Then how could someone actually|recruit people to worship the Devil? Only a secret inner circle|practice traditional Satanism. But Eric Stark|and other groups like his... are spreading|a powerful message-- God does not|really exist. Therefore, we can all|make up our own rules. Come with me.|I've got something to show you. These visions|that you've seen... have all been seen by others|throughout the centuries. Accounts of demonic attack|are common... in all cultures and religions. There, you see? There's a spiritual battle|going on in this world. We're all part of it|every day of our lives. - [ Sighs ]|- From what Sister Rosa has told me, I believe that Cody will be|an important part of this battle. I have seen the glory of God in|her, Maggie. I know you have too. What will|Eric do with her? ''All these things|will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down|and worship me.'' Satan's|temptation of Christ. He'll try to turn her|to his side, Maggie. - If he can't, he'll destroy her.|- What do I do? Get her back|whatever way you can. - I-I can't go back to Eric's place.|- Does she never leave? They're taking her|to the dentist tomorrow. Then, that's our chance!|John will go with you. I've helped families get their kids|out of New Dawn before. We won't make a move unless|we're sure she won't be hurt. These are directions|to our convent in Vermont. I'll be waiting|for you. - I don't know if I can do this.|- Yes, you can, Maggie. There is hope.|You must believe that. Not just for Cody. All of us are chosen|by God, and all of us can stand against|the darkness in His light. I never brought any of the other|children up here, Cody. Just you. - You know why?|- No. 'Cause I'm your father|now, Cody. You never had|a father before, did you? No. Look. Pretty, isn't it? All this, as far|as the eye can see, is just a small part|of what can be yours, Cody, if you're|a good daughter... and you do|what I say. and you do|what I say. But you have|to choose... soon. This only works if it comes|from your heart. What does God offer|that compares? Does He even exist? Maybe God's|just a nice idea-- like the Easter bunny. He's not real... is He? I know how|you can tell. [ Gasps ] In the Bible,|my lord says, ''If thou be the child of God,|cast thee down from hence. ''For He shall give His angels|charge over thee to keep thee... and in their hands|they shall bear thee up.'' Jump, Cody. Jump. If you believe|in God, jump. If not,|you come to me. What do you believe in, Cody?|My hand? Huh? It's here.|You can see it. Satan rules it,|and it will protect you always. Or His hand?|Is it there? Huh?|Or isn't it? Will He catch|you or not? - If you believe, Cody,|- [Panting] jump! -Jump!|- [ Gasps ] After you. Ahh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.|I'm sorry, darling. Come on. Let's get you|back inside. Bugatti, homicide. - Agent Travis.|- Travis-- I heard of you. None of your voodoo stuff here.|Just some bum got torched. Hey, Frank.|How are you doing? [Chattering, Indistinct] It's a Druid rune spell. Straight out of the 16th century. Think we know|how it started. How long will it take your forensics|lab to get prints off of that? Mm, call in a favor,|a couple of hours, maybe. We're out of time on this, Frank.|It's Easter eve. We have Stark's prints on file from|a drug bust ing82. If they match-- If they match,|I'll get you a warrant... on this Devil-loving bastard|before lunch. Hold it. There they are. [Woman]|No, it's fine. Sure. Yeah, tomorrow|at 5:00, okay? Yeah. No, I'm sure|we can fit you in. Okay? Have a good afternoon.|Bye. - Yes?|- Thank you. [Drill Whirring] [Child Whimpering] - Mim!|- [Dentist] We're just about done. Tell Eric I'll have the new|dental records ready by tonight. Thank you, Doctor.|That's a relief. Wait a minute! - [Door Opening]|- Maggie, I was getting worried. [ Groans ] Ohh! Wait! [ Tires Screeching,|Horns Blaring ] - Stop that woman!|- [ Horn Honking ] [ Tires Screeching ] - Oh.|- [ Screams ] [ Tires Screeching ] Run, Cody! Run! After you. Thank you. - [ Grunts ]|- [ Gasps ] [ Shrieking, Growling ] Eric Stark,|this is the police! We have a warrant|to search the premises! [Pounding] [ Beeping ] Where we going, Mim? Vermont, to see Sister Rosa.|She has some friends there. - Kids? Like at school?|- We'll see. Looks like he blew town. We've gotta strip this place|down to the floorboards... until we find a lead on him. The little girl's|only got a few hours left. - You got anything?|- Not yet. We have access,|but his files are encrypted. We need anything on property that|he owns, places he might be staying. Just a whole lot|of nothing. Mm-hmm. [ Scoffs ]|Not even dust. Paint's fresh. Does your forensics team|have an A.L.S.? - Yeah, they got all those toys.|- We're gonna need it. [Coins Dropping] [ Dialing ] [ Line Ringing ] - Oh, thank you.|- Buenos dias. - Hi.|- You're sick. Oh, I'm so sorry. Out of the mouths|of babes, huh? - [Tires Screeching]|- Go! - [ Horn Honking ]|- [ Brakes Squealing ] [ Tires Screeching ] - [ Horn Honking ]|- [ Tires Screeching ] [Honking Horn] - [ Tires Screeching ]|- [ Siren Wailing ] - What the hell are you doing?|- Officer, you don't understand. - Give me your keys, now!|- They're trying to kill us. - License and registration.|- [ Vehicle Approaching] [ Tires Screeching ] We've got|to get out of here! Run!|Run, baby, run! Go! Go! [ Screams ] Looks like your boy's got serious|money stashed in the Caymans. The I.R.S. might be able|to make a case. What about property? He owns some kind of country estate|north of the city. - I need an address on that.|- Working on it. - Okay.|- We're all set. Lights, please. Try over here. Oh, my God. Think your guys can pull|DNA off of that? [Technician]|Yes, sir. Need to run a match|against the kids. Yeah. Yeah.|Lights, please. - [Cell Phone Ringing]|- How long is it gonna take you... - to get those crates analyzed?|- Hello. Agent Travis, it's Maggie.|They've got Cody. - Where are you?|- I'm at a diner on Route 17... - about 30 miles south of Albany|- Do not move. Don't talk to anyone. I'll be there|as soon as I can, okay? - Okay. [ Hangs Up ]|- Agent Travis? Got a location on that estate.|It's just off 87-- Let me guess.|Just outside of Albany. Right. It'll take a couple of hours to get|there. I'll call the State Troopers. I'll catch a lift from Air Support,|and I'll meet you there. - I'm gonna need local backup.|- You got it. [ Siren Blares ] - Maggie! Are you all right?|- Yes. Stark's on the move. Our best guess|is that he took Cody... to an old estate he owns|just north of here. We're gonna get her back,|though. I promise you that. - You Travis?|- Yeah, that's right. The place is about a half|an hour away from here. Local police have already|done some reconnaissance. - How's it look?|- The entrance is guarded. Oh, that's no good. The element of surprise is the key|thing. They might hurt the girl. Well, there used to be a dirt road|about two miles up the interstate. It's probably overgrown.|Could get us on the grounds. All right, we'll rendezvous there.|No flashers. No sirens. No one goes in that property|until my command! Ah! The prodigal daughter|returns! Just in time|for her last supper. It's Easter eve,|sweetheart. You only have|a few hours left. Tonight you can be|reborn through my lord, or die for yours. You're alone, Cody. And through me... him. Now, this is the last time|I'm going to ask you. Join us, Cody. Join us... if you want to live. Cody, do what he says. Please. Is that it? Is that all you can do? Dahnia, I don't think|Cody's hungry. Why don't you prepare the Light|of the World for her big night. - Has she called?|- Still nothing. Mother Superior is ready|to lock up for the night. They should've|been here hours ago. What do you want me to do? Tell everyone to meet me|in the chapel. These people are|under attack, Sister. They need our prayers. [Travis]|That must be it. I want you to stay|in the car. I need to be there|for Cody. I'm serious, Maggie. Where's that backup? They were|right behind us. They've got to be|right back there somewhere. You wait for them at the turn off.|We'll stay here. You look so beautiful,|little one. [ Snaps Fingers ] Tonight is a very|special night. Tonight... you must make your mommy|and new daddy... proud. [ Grunts ] [ Whispering ]|Thanks for waiting. Lights are on|upstairs. Okay. Let me check. - Maggie!|- [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Yelling, Grunting ] [ Groans ] - [ Groaning ]|- Come on! She's getting away! [ Panting ] Hey-- [Clamoring] You bastard! It's customary|for guests to kneel. [Men Chanting] - Cody!|- [ Chanting Continues ] [Rustling] [ Snarling ] For the girl Cody,|the innocent, that she may one day|stand against the dragon, -we pray to the Lord.|-[ Together ] Lord, hear our prayer. For Maggie O'Connor, that she|will have faith in you, Lord, -grant her strength.|-[ Together ] Lord, hear our prayer. Send your angels|to protect them, Father. [Bell Tolling] Send your angels to stand against|the forces of darkness... that would do them harm. - We pray to the Lord.|- Lord, hear our prayer. This is it, Cody. I know you like angels,|don't you? Well, Satan was an angel too-- the most beautiful angel|of them all. So beautiful... that God gave him|dominion over the earth. No!|[ Gasps ] All you have to do... is cry out to him. Ask him for mercy. Call his name. Say his name! [ Exhales Sharply ] - [ Cocks Gun ]|- Choose, Cody. Choose Satan as your god,|or your beloved Mim dies. - No!|- Don't, Cody. Don't. Close your eyes.|We're faraway from here. We're together. - We'll always be together.|- What's your choice? What's|your choice, Cody? Say it! - Police! Open up!|- [ Crowd Clamoring ] [Glass Breaking] Kill the girl!|Shoot her! [ Groans ] - [ Grunts ]|- Mim! [ Gunshot ] No! - [ Crying ]|- [ Grunting ] [ Groans ] [ Exhales Slowly ] [ Gasps ] I deliver you|unto... him. Drop! - Maggie!|- [Creaking, Rumbling] - Maggie!|- [Creaking Continues] [ Yelling ] [ Yells ] Are you hurt? Keep your head down! Jenna! Come on, Maggie! Was anybody else|in there? [ Sobs ] So, are you going back|to work at the hospital? - If they'll have me.|- How's Jenna doing in rehab? Fine, so far. She asked me|to adopt Cody. No one will ever take|her away from me again. Come on. We're gonna be|late for the church bells. We're|right on time. You ready?|Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [ Bells Chiming ] [Knife Clatters] Are you all right? It's all right now. [ Children Shouting,|Laughing ]
