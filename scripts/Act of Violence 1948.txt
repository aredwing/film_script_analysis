Yes, it's typical California weather|here in Santa Lisa... ...for these solemn rites of Memorial Day. - And following the parade...|- Yes, sir? - You got a single room?|- I think so, sir. I can give you a very nice single at 350. How long will you be staying? I don't know. - Never mind that.|- Yes, sir. Thank you. And now, I wanna call on|a fellow veteran... ...who probably had more to do with|our finally getting this housing project... ...than anyone else in town. I mean Frank Enley. I guess you all know Frank and I'm sure|you know how hard he's worked. So let's get him up here|and make our thanks official. Come on up, Frank. - Come on, speak, Frank.|- Go on, big shot. - You heard what the man said.|- Come on, thattaboy. On the double, captain. First time I ever had a chance|to give orders to a captain. - Nice work, Frank.|- Thanks. You know, Frank didn't only help|to build this project. He's worked with us day and night|from the very beginning. He helped keep our spirits up.|Believe me, there were times... ...when, well, the flesh was willing|but the spirit was pretty low. Go ahead, Frank, it's all yours. Well, as you all know... ...I was just one of the contractors|on this project. I had to attend those meetings|to keep my job. Now, seriously,|what I want to say to you is this... ...that it was you fellas,|you and your families... ...that really put this thing over. You stuck together|and you fought for what you wanted. And if I gave you any help at all... ...well, believe me, I am very happy|and I'm very proud that I was able to. - Thanks, Frank. Thanks.|- Thank you. Edith. Edith. - Yes?|- I can't find that other rod. - It's in there.|- It's not in here. - Back in the corner, behind the table leaves.|- I've looked back of the table... - Oh.|- Honestly, sometimes I wonder. Nights are cold there and you forget|your heavy jacket and your boots. - I won't need them.|- If you think you're gonna... Look, I was going fishing before you put on|your first pair of bobby socks. I'm going out on a nice little lake|in a nice dry boat. - And get a nice fat cold... Ow! Ooh!|- Be careful now. You get that... You're getting fresh lately, aren't you. Getting used to you, that's all.|You've lost your glamour. Oh, I have, have I? Certainly have. - I've lost my glamour, huh?|- Uh-huh. - Lost all my glamour, huh?|- Mm-hm. Why don't you go out and tell Fred|that I had to go to the convention. - You want to?|- You think he'd fall for that? Sure. Oh, no. Oh, no, you wanted to go fishing.|You're going fishing. He'll be right out, Fred. Bye-bye, Georgie.|Take care of your mother now. You be a good boy now, Georgie.|Mommy will be right back. - Hello, youngster.|- Hi. Finally, you let him out of your clutches. - It was a battle, but I got away from her.|- Ha, ha. Say, Edith, why don't you and I|go up to the lake? - We'll leave him to do the housekeeping.|- You old goat. Aren't you ashamed? Guess it's not a good idea.|I don't think I can trust Frank with Martha. Listen to him.|- We'll be gone a couple of days. - Be back tomorrow night.|- Don't hurry on my account. - We're gonna paint the town, aren't we?|- Uh-huh. Well, don't call us up to bail you out.|Ha-ha-ha. Bye. Have fun. Say, is that your phone or mine? - Oh, it's mine. Bye.|- Bye. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, who is it? Wait here. Just a minute. Yes? - Is this where Frank Enley lives?|- Yes. - Is there something I can do? I'm his wife.|- No, I wanna see him. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Enley's out of town. Perhaps I could... Is it business or...? Not exactly. - Some other time.|- Is there any message? - Can I tell him who called?|- Where did you say he went? Redwood Lake.|If it's important, they have a phone... No, thank you. Some other time. The number's in the glove compartment. You have trouble, call us.|We'll send a man out to you. If you're out of town,|we'll put you in touch with the auto club. If you leave the state, you notify us. Here, you gotta sign this one too.|Right there. That's a boy. If you wanna keep the car out|another week, just send us a money order. Boss don't like checks.|We'll check your mileage... Got a fellow named Enley staying here? - Yeah, Frank Enley. Santa Lisa man.|- Where is he? - Cabin number four.|- Where's that? Across the road. He ain't there now though. Where is he now? Boat number 14.|They're fishing over in the inlet now. - Give me a boat.|- You want bait and tackle, I suppose. Five dollars deposit, 75 cents an hour. Get your deposit back|if the boat ain't damaged. You take this one. Wait a minute.|Let me give you a hand there. Some lake. Swarming with them, huh? Patience, lad. Patience. - Can I give you a hand with your fish?|- Very funny. Let's have a couple of beers, Pop. - Where's your fish?|- Go on, tell the man where your fish are. Where's our fish?|Well, how do you like that? We ought to be asking|for our money back. Don't let him throw you.|He's just preserving his dignity. Heh, heh. Say, if I can't catch them,|they ain't there. Did that fella find you? - Who's that?|- A fella was looking for you. Hired a boat, went out after you. Didn't tell me his name.|A young fella, walked with sort of a limp. Another thing,|I've fished every lake in these hills. - Come on, let's go.|- Morning, noon and night. - And it's been my experience that...|- Let's go, Fred. Well, aren't you gonna finish|your beer? While you're out in the afternoon,|they're biting in the morning... Look, Fred, I think|I'd better go on back to town. - Going back to town? You mean tonight?|- No, I mean now. - But we just got here. I thought...|- I'm sorry, but I've got to. - What are you sore about?|- I'm not. - You sound sore.|- I'm not. It's just that I remembered something.|That's all. Bread and butter.|Let's get some chow and then we can... - No, I wanna go back now.|- If that's the way you feel about it. Guess I don't have a say|one way or the other. Fred, here. Throw that stuff in the car. And I'll settle up with Pop. Okay, but I don't get it. You come all the way up here,|turn around and go back. Pop. Pop, we gotta leave. - What's the damage?|- Leaving? - Why don't you wait until morning?|- Come on. Let's have the bill. Uh... Let's see. There's the cabin, $3, boat, 2.25. There's bait, a dollar. - Two beers is 40 cents and...|- Let's go, Pop, what is it? Three dollars, 5.25... ...six twenty-five, 6.65... If you don't wanna talk,|you don't wanna talk, that's all. - See you tomorrow.|- Good night, kid. Martha? No, it's me. Hey, what are you doing back|so soon? - Something go wrong?|- No, no. - You're all right, aren't you?|- Yeah, sure. The fishing wasn't very good|and got kind of chilly. The big outdoor man. I remembered things I ought to take care of|at the office tomorrow... ...so we decided to come on back. - To get something to eat?|- What? Oh, no. Nails or no nails,|I guess I'd better fix something. - You must be starved.|- Yeah, I am a little bit. Don't expect anything fancy.|I didn't get a chance to shop today. Anybody been around while I was gone? No, but I've been away myself. Wait a minute.|There was a man here just after you left. What did he look like? Oh, he was just average. He was lame. - Do you know anybody like that?|- No. Guess he'll be back|if it's anything important. You can set the table if you want... What do you say let's eat|in the kitchen tonight? Do you want to? - We could go out if you'd rather.|- I don't feel like going out. All right.|Come on out and talk to me then. I'll see what I can whip up. Wait until I tell you about that Martha. We almost wound up in the clink. If I hadn't talked like a Dutch uncle,|we probably would have. Frank? - I'll be right there.|- Oh, all right. How about a tomato omelet?|That sound good? Yeah, that sounds great. You know, honestly,|that Martha's a menace. First, she breezed|right through a boulevard stop. Oh, open this for me, will you, hon? Of course,|there would be a police car there. - Open it.|- Oh, okay. Anyway, Martha tried to give him|an argument. Of course she didn't have a leg|to stand on. Still, the way they were talking to her,|I was getting so mad that I could've... Oh, answer it, will you, hon? Oh, let's let it ring, shall we? Why are you so lazy all of a sudden?|It might be Mother, long-distance... It couldn't be.|Your mother called last week. She wouldn't call again so soon. If you're gonna be stubborn about it... ...I'll get it myself.|- No, don't answer it. - Frank, what's the matter?|- Nothing's the matter. - What is it? Tell me.|- I don't wanna talk or listen to anybody. I don't wanna see anybody. I wanna|spend a quiet evening in my own home. Is that asking too much? No. No, of course not. - More coffee?|- No, thanks. - Can I give you a hand with the dishes?|- No, they won't take a minute. - What in...?!|- Shh! Frank, that's the man|that was here this afternoon. Yes, I know. - But who is he? Why do we have to hide?|- Somebody I don't want to see. - Frank, this is our house. Our own house.|- Edith, don't talk so loud. I was only whispering. He followed me to the lake.|I didn't tell you. - I thought he wouldn't come back.|- He asked where you were. - Why did you tell him? What would...?|- I didn't know. It's all right. It doesn't matter. - What does he want?|- Nothing. He's a guy that I knew in the Army. He's not right.|They've had him in the hospital. - Does he want help or money? Is that it?|- No, no. I was his CO|and he's got some crazy idea... ...that everything that ever happened to him|is my fault. If I see him, there'll just be a scene. I don't want to see him. - What are we going to do? We can't hide.|- Just forget about it. Baby, go on to bed, please. He'll go away|if he thinks we're not home at home. He's still there. He'll go away after a while. Frank, I still don't understand. Why...? Edith, a lot of things happened in the war|that you wouldn't understand. Why should you?|I don't understand them myself. Come on, let's go on up. It's all right, Georgie. It was just a bad dream. It's all right, honey. Go to sleep now. Go on to sleep. There. Is he still there? Yeah. He won't come back again. Look, baby, go on back to bed. It's all right now.|There's nothing to worry about. Where are you going? Just downstairs. I'll be up in a minute. Frank. I was just... I want to ask you something. When we packed up all of a sudden|and came out here from Syracuse... ...three thousand miles|across the country... ...was that on account of him? Not collecting your terminal leave pay... ...dropping all our friends back East.|It all was, wasn't it, Frank? I know you went through|some bad times in the war. I know some things must have happened|that hurt you. I never asked. But I am asking now, Frank.|I want to know. Do you recognize him? Joe Parkson. Was he...? - You saw him this afternoon and tonight.|- But I remember him from your letters. He was your friend. Yes, he was my bombardier. Frank, I think I know now. What do you mean? He was with you|all the time you were flying. - Twenty-five missions.|- No, it was 21. And a year in the prison camp.|Was that it? Was that what did it to him?|The strain he went through? Things like that happen sometimes. What did you mean|when you said he'd make a scene? Did you mean he might be violent? He might be. What happened at the lake|this afternoon? Nothing, he came up there... Frank, look at me. - He tried to kill you, didn't he?|- No, he was nowhere near me. - I just left, that's all.|- Oh, this has gone far enough. - What are you doing?|- Calling the police. - No, he's sick.|- What if he comes back? - He won't.|- How do you know what he'll do? He wouldn't hurt you or the baby.|You saw that. - I'm not thinking about myself.|- I know, but... I don't care what a great pal he was. I'll not gonna let you get killed|because you think you owe something. This is not a thing|you can go to the police about. Then call the Army, an Army hospital.|Tell them what he tried to do. - Tell them to come and get him.|- No. Frank. You don't know what made him|the way he is. I do. What are you going to do? I don't know. Frank! - Now, get out of here.|- Back in the house. He's gone. He's left town. Look, if you don't believe me.|The garage. He took the car... Oh! - Where is he?|- I told you, he's gone. I don't know where he is.|I don't know when he'll be back. Upstairs. He's got it nice here, hasn't he? Real nice. It's all right, Georgie, don't cry. Just so there won't be|any misunderstanding... ...tell him I'll be back. If you are, the police will be here|to meet you. You'd better check with your husband.|I don't think he'd like that. Why don't you leave us alone?|Why don't you go away? He never did anything to you. I know all about you.|He told me about you. He thinks he has to protect you,|but I'm not going to. - I don't care what you went through.|- What did he tell you about me? What did he tell you? Did he tell you|that I'm a cripple because of him? Did he tell you about the men|that are dead because of him? Tell you what happened to them|before they died? Mike Garby? He had a wife and a kid too. Made a nuisance out of himself|showing everybody their picture. Afterwards,|somebody got the picture back. It was so covered with blood|you couldn't tell what it was. And the other men were moaning|outside the wire all night long. I was lucky. They thought I was dead|and left me there. But it's not his fault.|He had nothing to do with it. - He was a stool pigeon for the Nazis.|- You're lying. You're crazy. He told me you were crazy. They even had to put you in the hospital|because you were crazy. Sure, I was in the hospital.|But I didn't go crazy. I kept myself sane. You know how? I kept saying to myself: "Joe, you're the only one alive|that knows what he did. You're the one|that's got to find him, Joe. " I kept remembering. I kept thinking back to that prison camp. One of them lasted until morning. By then, you couldn't tell|his voice belonged to a man. He sounded like a dog|that got hit by a truck and left in the street. Get out. Get out of here and leave us alone. Save it. He isn't worth it. You be good now, Georgie. Mommy's gotta go next door|and she'll get your breakfast right away. Hi, Edith. Martha, would you take care|of Georgie for me? - I have to go to Los Angeles.|- Why? What's the matter? Nothing. I've just gotta see Frank.|Something's come up. Did Frank go to Los Angeles?|Must've left in sort of a hurry, didn't he? Yes. He decided to go|to the convention... ...after all. Look, honey, I've been married|for 35 years and believe me... ...these things are never serious. It's nothing like that, Martha. Please, Martha, I can't talk about it.|Can you take care of Georgie for me? Yeah, sure. I have|a dentist appointment this morning. But you can bring him over|after lunch, huh? Well, all right. Thanks, Martha. Frank. Edith. Oh, Frank. What's the matter now? What's happened?|Edith, get ahold on yourself. What is it? He came back. He was in the house.|He forced his way in. What do you mean? He didn't hurt you... No, nothing like that.|He just frightened me. Oh, Frank. The awful things he said. What did he tell you? - What difference does that make now?|- Tell me what he said. What did he tell you? Some crazy stuff about something|that you did in that prison camp. Oh, darling. I know it isn't true,|but he believed it. That's why he's so dangerous.|He had a gun. He wanted to kill you. You've got to think of yourself.|Frank, we've got to do something. There's nothing to do. Frank, a man's trying to murder you.|Of course there's something you can do. - And if you won't do it, I will.|- No. There's nothing you can do.|There's nothing anybody can do. But why not? Because... ...I told you he was crazy. Well, he's not. No. I didn't want to tell you.|I didn't want you to know it. Why should you carry it too? All right. Suppose there is a grain of truth to it. Suppose you did have|some kind of trouble with him. I can understand how something like that|could happen in a prison camp. No, you don't know what happened. What was it, Frank? Whatever you did,|you must have had reasons. You can always find reasons.|Even the Nazis had reasons. I did it to save lives.|That was my reason. Did what? What did you do?|Tell me what happened, Frank. Please. After we were shot down|and sent to a prison camp... ...Joe, myself, some other officers...|I wrote you about that. I know. I was the senior officer in my bunkhouse.|I was responsible for the rest of the men. Toward the end, it got... We were all starving to death|and going crazy. One day, Joe came to me.|They'd dug a tunnel. He and some of the others.|They were gonna try to escape. I told him not to do it. I begged him. The week before, in the British section,|12 men had been shot for the same thing. I told him that they didn't have a chance.|They'd be dead before they started. He wouldn't listen to me. I lay awake all night trying to think... ...trying to figure out|some way of stopping him. The next morning,|I went to the prison commandant. He was an SS colonel. I made a deal with him. Frank. I said that I'd tell him|if he'd go easy on the men. He promised. Word of an officer. So I waited. I waited all day. I thought that the guards|would close up the tunnel or something. But they didn't. They acted as though|they didn't even know about it. That night, I tried to talk to Joe again. But he wouldn't pay attention to me. The men were getting desperate.|Anything to get out. So they started through. And then I heard the guards|at the other end of the tunnel. They'd set a trap for them. They bayoneted them.|They set dogs on them. And when it was over,|they didn't even shoot them. They just left them there. Oh, Frank. You only did what you thought was right.|You made a mistake, an awful one. But you can't suffer all your life|for one mistake. We can do something now.|We'll go to Washington. And have it in every paper|in the country? We can save the clippings for Georgie|when he's old enough to read. Look, Frank, they'd listen to you.|They'd know the truth. Sure they'd know, like the Nazis knew.|They knew before I did. Even before Joe did. Do I have to spell it out for you?|Do I have to draw a picture? I was an informer. It doesn't make any difference why I did it.|I betrayed my men. They were dead. The Nazis even paid me a price.|They gave me food and I ate it. I ate it. Oh, Frank, no. I hadn't done it just to save their lives. I'd talked myself into believing it,|that he'd keep his word. But in my guts from the start,|I think I knew he wouldn't. And maybe I didn't even care.|They were dead and I was eating. And maybe that's all I did it for.|To save one man. Me. There were six widows. There were 10 men dead|and I couldn't even stop eating. Go on. Go on home.|You don't have to say anything. We were in the same outfit together... ...and I thought as long as I was passing|through town, I'd look him up. But he seems to be kind of hard to find. - Sorry to bother you like this but...|- It's no bother at all. Only I'm afraid I can't help you much. Yeah, he's out of town.|Yes, he's gone to Los Angeles. Builders and Contractors Convention?|Well, that shouldn't be too hard to find. Thanks for the information, Mrs. Finney.|Thank you very much. - Yes, ma'am?|- Excuse me... ...do you have a Mr. Parkson registered? - Joseph Parkson.|- Just a minute, madam. Never mind. Joe. How much do I owe you? Well, you could be more enthusiastic.|Do I look that bad? I haven't seen a mirror|since I got off the plane. Seven dollars, sir. Thank you. - How'd you find me?|- Was nothing much once I got here. - I just asked people and described you.|- Oh. - No, Joe, it had nothing to do with that.|- Well, you can't stay here now. I'm leaving. Why? Where are you going?|Joe, I wanna talk to you. I haven't got time.|Anyway, you've got to go back. Joe. Ann, you shouldn't have come here.|You need any money? - No.|- Then get on a train. Get back to New York. - Right now. Quick.|- Why? What's going to happen? Joe, you promised me. All right, I promised you.|What more do you want? Anyway, it's got nothing to do with that.|I got an offer of a job out here. - I was gonna wire you when I got set.|- Don't lie. Don't you think I know that look? I thought I'd seen the last of it. Here.|I found this in your room in New York. Joe, you can't do it. Don't you know that?|Don't you understand that yet? Joe, do you love me or don't you?|You can't do it... Maybe I don't love you enough. Joe. Joe. - Mrs. Enley?|- Yes? - I have a message for your husband.|- He's not here. Has a man been here to see him?|A man named Parkson? Wait. Listen, I'm his girl. Joe Parkson's girl.|Do you think I want him to be a murderer? I took him next door. He's 2 years old. What's this for? I don't even know how to shoot it. I thought maybe I could find him.|Parkson. Try to scare him off. He won't scare.|I wish it were that simple. Where is your husband, Mrs. Enley? You must trust me. Why should I?|You don't care about Frank. Look, I've came a long way to stop this.|Maybe nobody can. - But I'm the only one that has a chance.|- What can you do? - I've seen him. He's vicious. He's a killer.|- Is he? What about your husband? - Do you call him a murderer?|- No. He didn't mean it. He's been sick with it. They're both sick with it.|And I want Joe to be well. - Where is your husband?|- I don't know. - Tell me. I'll call the police if I have to.|- No. Would you rather see him dead? He won't kill Frank.|He doesn't know where he is. - He's found out.|- No. I just saw him. He was leaving town. I've come 3000 miles and he couldn't|wait five minutes to talk to me. He was in a hurry, Mrs. Enley,|because he knew where he was going. I want the Blake Hotel, Los Angeles. Mr. Frank Enley, person to person. Who? Hello? I can't hear you. Parkson's found out where you are.|He's coming there. I can't... Be quiet a minute, I've got to... I can't hear you. Ah. How could you heard what he said? You wasn't there. - I was there.|- You was not there. You was drunk. - I was drunk but I was there.|- Where? Good night, Tim.|- So long, Harry. We're closed, Jack. - Look, I've got money.|- Yeah, but we're closed. Jack, for you, I don't lose a license.|Sorry, no go. - Put it away, will you? You'll coax me.|- Tim. What are you doing down here,|handsome? Looking for some kicks? No place to go? Hey, you really need that drink. Well, I got influence.|Want me to use it? Come on, Tim, give us one for the road. A quickie. Just one. Okay? Hey, stick around. He'll give it to you. Hey, what's your hurry, handsome? Gee, you ought to have a coat.|It's a terrible night. - What's your name, handsome?|- Frank. I had a better place|but it got too expensive. You know, it's terrible nowadays|trying to find a decent place. Go on, drink it. It'll make you feel better. Cheer up, Frankie. So you got troubles. There's plenty else to think about. Laughs. Kicks. So you're unhappy. Relax. No law says you got to be happy. Look at me. I'm not happy.|But I get my kicks. Gee, how could anybody stand it|if they didn't get their kicks? That bad, huh? What is it?|Love trouble or money trouble? Listen, Frankie, I've seen them all. I've seen all the troubles in the world|and they boil down to just those two. You're broke or you're lonely. Or both. You look like the kind|that probably has a nice little wife. Nice little house, some kids. - I have.|- Yeah? Now no more? What happened? Somebody else|come along for you, for her maybe? So it's money. No. Well then what have you got|to worry about? Listen, Frankie boy, if you've got money,|nothing can be too bad. With money, you can fix anything. Get out of town if you have to. Go someplace else|and start all over again. You're free. Money. Money. Yes, I've got money. What, are they paging him now? What makes you so sure he'll be there? He'll be there all right. I hope you know what you're doing. How much is this business of yours|worth, anyway? Oh, I don't know.|Twenty thousand, maybe more. Are you crazy? Hey, what kind of a jam are you in? Go ahead now. Do it like I told you. Is this Mr. Parkson? I'm speaking for Frank. Yeah, Enley. He says he wants|to make things right with you. He says he's got a business.|It's worth a lot of money. He says if you'll go back east|and forget it, he'll give it to you. The whole thing. He says he'll sell it and give... What is it? What is it? He's laughing. Where is he? Hey, where you going? Hey, Frankie, listen. Hey, wait. I know a guy we can go to.|We'll figure out something. It can't be that bad. You'll see.|It'll be all right, you just see. - He's okay. Is Gavery here tonight?|- Yeah. Threw a nine.|Who likes to field the come? Nine's a field number.|Who likes to field the come? Who wants the big six or eight?|Well, there'll be a number. Good evening, Mr. Gavery. - Hello, girl. You got troubles again?|- No, it's him. - Can he pay?|- He's got a business worth 20,000. - No.|- That's what he said. Honest. Bring him over. Ahem. If you can do him good, remember|it was me that brought him to you. Go get him. This is Mr. Gavery,|the attorney I told you about. - This is Frank.|- Sit down, Frank. Don't be nervous.|You're in good hands. Here. I understand you've got yourself|in a little trouble. No, it isn't... It was a friend of mine.|It was a close friend of mine. Sure. Now, suppose you go ahead|and tell us about this friend of yours? Tell him, sugar. Be smart.|He's a lawyer, no kidding. They got all kinds of laws.|They got laws to help people too. Go on, tell him. Well, I was in...|I mean, this friend of mine. It was during the war.|It was during the last few months... - Hi, Johnny.|- Hello. All right, go ahead. Come on then. Now we have privacy. It was in the last few months of the war. We were flying over Germany.|Our plane was hit in the wing. I moved away from Syracuse|and came out here. And now it's finally caught up with me. He didn't mean it,|what happened over there. He just made a mistake.|One mistake in his whole life. That's all. Everybody makes mistakes. - Did you hear it?|- All of it. Here. Drink it. You got yourself|in a tough situation, Frank. Really bad. I'm very sorry for you. It's a shame. If it weren't for the papers,|you could talk to the police. Have them scare this fellow out of town. - No, no.|- No, of course not. You have a position to think of. You made a new life for yourself,|didn't you? And you're entitled to protect it. If we can't get protection|from the cops... ...we'll get our own cop. - A private policeman.|- What did I tell you? Not just an ordinary private detective. This job will be dangerous. We need someone who can handle himself.|Take chances if he has to. And he won't be cheap, mind you. Might cost as high as 8, $ 10,000. That's all right. Well then, take that boy outside|for instance. - Johnny?|- Good boy, Johnny. He wouldn't just sit around. He'd get in touch with his fellow.|Make a date with him. - Someplace quiet.|- What are you trying to sell him? He talks to him. He tells him to get lost. - Nothing wrong in that, is there?|- No. So maybe he takes the hint|and leaves town. - He wouldn't.|- Or he's hotheaded. He gets sore and plays rough. Well, Johnny has a gun too. You forget all about it. That's worth 10,000, isn't it? Frank, you don't want any part of this.|You don't want murder. - It's all right.|- Let him go, he don't want to do it. - Doesn't he?|- No, what do you think I am? You're the same man|you were in Germany. You did it once. You can do it again. What do you care about one more man? You sent 10 along already. Sure, you're sorry they're dead.|That's the respectable way to feel. Get rid of this guy and be sorry later. It's up to you. He dies or you die. It's him or you. - He'll go for it.|- Might need a little persuading. You better take her. You're|the same man you were in Germany. You did it once, you'll do it again. What do you care about one more man?|You sent 10 along already. Tonight. The tunnel is through. The north corner,|we make the break tonight. You haven't got a chance.|Remember what happened to the others? We're not gonna starve any longer. Don't do it, Joe. Don't do it. You have nothing|to be ashamed of, Capt. Enley. An officer is responsible for his men. They'll be treated|with all possible leniency. Tonight, the north corner.|You'll find the tunnel. They'll try tonight. Don't do it, Joe. Don't do it. Don't do it, Joe! No, no, Joe! No, Joe! No, Joe, don't! No, Joe, don't! What's the matter with you? What are you trying to do?|Are you crazy or something? Johnny, you leave him alone now. He don't know what he's doing.|He's sick or something. - No, I'm all right. I'm all right.|- Come on. - Where?|- With me. Get him a drink or something.|He's out on his feet. Why did you have to come here?|I don't want any trouble. There ain't gonna be any trouble. Oh, leave him alone, Johnny.|He hasn't got any dough on... Here. Put hair on your chest. - Who are you?|- Me? I'm a businessman. You and me|are gonna do a little business. You got dough, friend. That's why they're all hanging around.|On the chisel. But not me, I'm gonna earn it. You get out of here. Take it easy, friend.|You ain't thinking right. You're in a jam. This joker's gonna give it to you. You got a wife, a kid. You want them to stand around crying|when they put you in that hole? Just because you ain't got what it takes? You got nothing to worry about. It's easy. A stakeout job. Come on, where can we talk to this guy? Johnny, please leave him alone.|Cut it out, will you? Come on, sucker. I'm telling you, it's your only out. Where do we talk to him? The hotel's no good. You live in a little town, don't you? That's the kind of place.|Quiet. Them hick cops. He'd go there too if we asked him.|Wouldn't he? Wouldn't he? Where is he, friend?|Where do I talk to him? Where is he? Blake Hotel. What are you doing here? I told you to go... - I'm not gonna walk out on this...|- Shh! I went to his house.|He has a wife and a baby. Yeah, I saw them. Didn't you feel anything? Anything at all? Joe, she's just a kid.|Haven't you hurt them enough? - He's got too much to pay for.|- Has she done anything to pay for? - She'd be better off without him.|- Are you the judge of that? Are you the law? What makes you think|you're so much better than he is? Whatever he done,|he's tried to make up for it. He's lived a decent, useful life ever since.|But what have you done? What are you gonna prove anyway?|With your vengeance, your violence. You aren't gonna bring those men back.|You're just gonna smash a few more lives. Enley, his wife, his son, me. I'm sorry about you, Ann. I warned you about|getting mixed up in this. All right, forget about me.|Sure, there are things I wanted. But that's not what I'm fighting for now.|I'm fighting for you. - I can take care of myself.|- How? Do you think you can kill a man|in cold blood and just forget it? Don't you know what that means? You'll have to live with hate day and night,|for the rest of your life. And look what's it done to you already. Joe, I made you forget it for a while,|I could again. You were happy, weren't you? If you go through with this, no matter|whether they kill you or put you in jail... ...even if they say you're sick and crazy,|and let you off easy... ...you're finished, Joe, you're washed up! As crippled in your mind as in your... Joe, I didn't mean it that way. That's all right. Ann. Ann, I... Hello. Yeah, this is Parkson. Johnny? Johnny who? Well, who are you, his bodyguard? Santa Lisa? Where in Santa Lisa? Okay. I'll be there. Wake up. Wake up, I gotta get out of here. - What time is it?|- Nearly four, you slept all day. Look, here's your money. Nobody touched a cent,|except what you spent yourself. There's about $8. You better hurry up.|I wanna get out of here. Out of town. Saint Joe, maybe. Six years I've been here, in this hole. It wasn't so bad. I got my kicks. I got along. Now what? Snap it up, will you? I'm in a hurry. I don't wanna have|anything to do with this. - With what?|- You know what. Listen, you gotta let me have|some money. I found your checkbook. Hundred dollars,|all you have to do is sign it. You can spare $ 100. It isn't much compared|to what you're gonna have to give Johnny. - Johnny, who's Johnny?|- Oh, come on. - Where is he?|- Look, I wouldn't... - Where'd he go?|- All I... - What did I tell him?|- What difference does it make? - I've got to know this. What did I tell him?|- Johnny called the other man. - Parkson?|- He made a date to meet him. - Where?|- That town where you live. - Santa Lisa.|- Yeah, at the railroad station. - What time?|- Nine o'clock, so it'd be dark. Only, you weren't gonna be there.|Just Johnny. He was gonna be there. - Where does he live?|- I don't know, nobody knows. - There must be some way I can find...|- Guys like him don't tell where they live. Hey, where you going? Could you come back here|and pick me up later? - Where you going?|- The station, 9:00. Be here at 8:30 sharp. Uh... - Don't come to the door, just wait out here.|- Okey-doke. Oh, Frank. You don't have to do that. - He's back, he's here in town.|- I know. He's got a girl. She called.|She said she'd go to the police. It doesn't matter, it's all settled.|Edith, she doesn't know. But she said|that he'd gone somewhere to see you. I saw him. - You talked with him?|- Yes, on the phone. He's leaving town. Believe me, it's all over. Don't worry about it, please. Then you're safe. You're safe. Don't, baby, please. I'm sorry. - Here.|- Thanks. Your suit's going to have to go|to the cleaners. You look tired, you must... Why don't I run you a nice hot bath? Okay. - Well, come on.|- Yeah. - How's the baby?|- Oh, fine. He was a little tired and had a runny nose,|so I put him to bed early. Probably out like a light by this time. Wow, that looks a little better. - Frank, I want to...|- Edith. Frank. You said it was all settled. - Does that mean you had to see him or...?|- No, it's over. - It's all over.|- That's true, isn't it? - You wouldn't...|- Lie to you? No. No. All right. - Edith.|- Sit down, Frank. It isn't that I don't wanna talk about it,|I just don't know how. I know. Neither do I. But I've thought a lot about a lot of things,|since I saw you. Ever since I first knew you, Frank,|and up until yesterday... ...I thought you were the finest,|most wonderful man in the whole world. Just that. Now, I know that you're|like everybody else. You have faults and weaknesses. If I hadn't been so young and silly,|I would have known it all along. It wouldn't have been such a shock|to find it out now. But that doesn't mean|that I don't love you. Or that I don't want to be your wife. Because I do. You wanna see the paper? Thank you, Edith. Let's not try to think about it anymore.|Not tonight. No. All right. - Edith.|- Yes? I think I heard the baby cry. - I didn't hear anything.|- Go up and look, will you, please? All right. Frank! This will be okay here. - You're still two blocks from the station.|- Yeah, I know. - Hi, Mr. Enley.|- Hello. All you can do now, Miss Sturges,|is wait right here. - We'll let you know if we find him.|- Thank you. No, wait. I've come to warn you|about something, Joe. After that, I don't care what you do. Come on, please get back. There's nothing you can do, stay back. - Joe.|- I didn't do it, Ann. I didn't do it. Call the emergency hospital. Never mind. - It's Enley.|- What happened? Some accident. They were coming from the station.|He was hanging on the car. Looks like a hold-up. - Is he dead?|- Well, I saw him drop there... - Well, you were here right?|- Yeah. Who's going to tell his wife? I will.
