[ RIZA SPEAKING PASHTO ] [ BELT BUCKLE CLINKING ] [ ZIPPER OPENS ] [ URINATING ] [ WOMAN ] Trouble Oh, trouble, set me free [ ZIPPER CLOSES ] I have seen your face And it's too much, too much for me Trouble Oh, trouble, can't you see? You're eating my heart away And there's nothing much left of me I've Drunk your wine You have made your world mine So won't you be fair? So won't you be fair? I Don't want no more of you So won't you be kind to me? Just let me go where I'll have to go there Well, la-di-da. [ SINGSONG ] Taxi. I heard a girl singing just now. Right over there. A Pashtun girl. No. Impossible. The girl in the red burka. We saw her today. No, Pashtun women cannot. They are forbidden to sing. The chick in the red burka didn't get the memo. This girl... Oh! Oh, God. Oh! This girl... Riza, Richie Lanz is about one thing, one thing only. What is it? Your ears. My ears. And signing. So it's two things. My ears and signing. I hear 'em, and I sign 'em. So simple. A Pashtun woman? From this village? They will kill her, and then right away, they will kill us. With big, sharp rocks. That is simple. Well, I think you're wrong. I hope you're wrong. And I think you're wrong. Look around. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Look at all of that. And look at me. What the hell am I doing here? This is so crazy, so random. This has got to be fate. There's got to be a reason for this. And the reason is that girl... and that TV show. I am supposed to be here. I will talk. You will translate. We will die. That's the spirit. I see that none of you are cable or satellite subscribers. But I'm pretty sure... you've heard about Afghan Star, huh? - [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] - It's a big, big hit. TV show that comes out of Kabul. [ ROOSTER CROWS ] [ GOAT BLEATS ] Heard about it. Heard about it. Well, I happen to have these babies right here. [ TRANSLATING ] They're like yours, but they're magic. [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] And I already know who the winner is. [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] I know who's the best, 'cause I heard the winner here last night. In a cave above your village. [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] My all-time guy would simply tell us, "Come together, right now, over her." [ SHOUTING IN PASHTO ] Uh, she is Tariq's daughter. She is Tariq's daughter. Of course. [ SHOUTING CONTINUES ] Get out! He... Is he proud? He's got to be. "How dare you my daughter insult?" Shame. Dishonor. "Eternal death." I mean, he just goes on, sir. - [ CHANTING IN PASHTO ] - [ OTHERS CHANTING ] So I guess that's a "no." [ CHANTING CONTINUES ] [ TIRE BLOWS ] Great. A flat tire. See? We are cursed. Oh, come on. It's a flat tire. I'm sure you know how to fix it. [ ENGINE STOPS ] [ RIZA GASPS ] A ninja! [ RIZA ] Salima. I must go to Kabul. Allah gave me this voice. This is his gift. Absolutely. But why are you in my trunk? I must honor him with my music. I must celebrate my God with my singing. I must go to Kabul. I must. Hey, you're preaching to the choir, but, you know, your father, family, apparently will kill me. Then it is Allah's will, and we shall die together. No. No, we shall not. I have no intention of dying, ever. Tell her, Riza. [ TRANSLATING ] [ RICHIE ] Kabul? That way. [ CLEARS THROAT ] Hold it right there, Salima. From the moment you heard me sing, since you found me in the cave, since we were put here on this earth, everything in our lives has led us to this time, this place. Richie Lanz, our story is already written, and now... now we shall play our parts. We must. There is no choice. It is God's will. Okay, but I'm gonna want 20%. No contract. Just a handshake. That's all I've ever had. A handshake is my word. Allah loves those who act justly. [ RICHIE ] All right. Back in the trunk. I'm kidding. [ MAN ] People Do you understand me now? Sometimes I feel a little mad Don't you know no one alive Can always be an angel When things go wrong, I seem a little sad But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood [ RICHIE ] A guy wouldn't have to walk that far. [ RIZA ] I must speak. Sure. We have time. I think you are a smart man, Mr. Richie, and a good one. All right. Calm down. Salima is in danger. [ RICHIE ] I will protect her. [ RIZA ] Against millions? Where will she even sleep? I have one bed, one room. If I bring an unmarried Pashtun girl in my building, my neighbors would tear us apart for the sin. Do you remember where we first met? [ CHATTERING ] 70-30. You pay room and board, all out of pocket. Done. I also get a taste of all the merch money. And I get a taste of the merch. In all markets, all endeavors. Boys, it's your lucky day. All right, none of you are leaving here with a vicious STD. Downside... Miss Merci's pulling an early retirement. Hangin' up my hot pants. I suggest you go down to the Chinese whorehouse on Chicken Street. [ CHATTERING ] Breakfast, darlin'? Got Captain Crunch, Lucky Charms. I come here for the waitress. [ MERCI CHUCKLES ] [ MAN SPEAKING PASHTO ] [ CHANTING IN DARI ] [ RICHIE ] Scared is normal. Scared is okay. Jon Bon Jovi throws up before every show. [ RIZA SPEAKING DARI ] We're on the list. Lanz, plus one. [ RIZA SPEAKING DARI ] There is no list. There's always a list. I appreciate your passion, but... Not my passion. Salima's passion. I mean, I'm just a hustler from LA. You know what's gonna happen to a Pashtun girl... that sings on national TV in this country? What her family is gonna do, her father? It's already done. Just the fact that her coming here, it's done. Look... And yet, she knows this, and here she stands in front of you just asking for a chance. Just asking for you to give her a chance. If the ulema doesn't shut us down, if the ministry of information doesn't throw me in jail, there will be another season, Mr. Lanz. Call me later. There is no later for Salima, or for you... or your country. If you let this girl sing on national TV, if you let the Afghan people see her courage... Stop. Stop! And to hear her voice... No! You do not lecture me about courage, about my country. Never. Never. Not you. Not an American. You people. You talk and talk. Have been talking at us for far too long. Courage? There are more death threats on this show than singers. Touch. Michael Jackson. Pink Floyd. The Eagles. The Bee Gees. Saturday Night Fever album. Fleetwood Mac. Miss Whitney Houston. They're all giants. Demigods. They all crushed... crushed 40 million units or more. Forty million units. Now, you work too hard for me not to say this. I consider you my new friend in Afghanistan. I want you to consider me... your new partner. Now, I have an 80-20... that's been stepped on by a preexisting 70-30. But your 15 against my 85... puts us both in a palace in the hills, my friend. And those numbers can be massaged. But the first thing... You got to just hear the girl sing. [ SPEAKING DARI ] Richie, the judges want to know... if Salima will be only singing in English. That's never happened before. Well, I'm afraid so. It's a touching story. She learned from a seriously wounded American GI... who was trapped in her village. As she nursed him back to health, he taught her one word a day, until finally, the music of the West. None of that's true. I mean, apparently there was a soldier. So only Cat Stevens? And Jimmy Cliff. She does the Muslim West. That's it. [ THEME ] [ DAOUD SPEAKING DARI ] [ APPLAUSE ] [ SPEAKING DARI ] What? What'd that twerp say? Nothing. I'm gonna go kill him, just in case. No, Richie. All right, when you're done, big James Brown finish. I come out, throw a hijab around you, escort you off the stage. Richie... You shrug off the shawl, stroll back to the mike, go down, a full knee drop. Nail that last verse one last time. Ignore him. You be you. You look like a lady. You sing like an angel. It'll be enough. [ MAN SINGING IN DARI ] He's very good. [ SPEAKING IN DARI ] [ APPLAUSE ] Okay. Now's a good time to be sick. [ APPLAUSE ] [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] [ GUITAR INTRO ] Okay. Let 'em hear you. Now that I've lost everything to you You say you want to start something new And it's breaking my heart you're leaving Baby, I'm grieving But if you wanna leave, take good care Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world It's hard to get by just upon a smile Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world I'll always remember you like a child, girl You know, I've seen a lot of what the world can do And it's breakin' my heart in two Because I never wanna see you sad, girl Don't be a bad girl But if you wanna leave, take good care Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world [ SPEAKS DARI ] It's hard to get by just upon a smile [ CHATTERING ] Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world I'll always remember you like a child, girl Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world It's hard to get by just upon a smile [ ENDS ] [ RICHIE ] Yeah! [ APPLAUDS ] Come on! Whoo! [ RICHIE ] Yeah! Come on! [ SPEAKING DARI ] [ MERCI ] How you feelin', boss? [ RICHIE ] They were with her. I can feel when it's working. And she had 'em. They didn't wanna show it, but she had 'em. I mean, she was something. [ SPEAKERS: MAN SINGING BALLAD ] She was really something. What else can a poor boy do? May I hide from the wind over here? [ CHUCKLES ] [ CONTINUES ] [ MALE REPORTER SPEAKING DARI ] We shook hands. That's a binding contract, sacred in my world! Phone calls have been made, to Dubai! I've heard the greatest! I've heard the best! The way she sang last night, she could have won it all! We could have won it all, Dad. [ TARIQ SPEAKS PASHTO ] [ DAOUD ] If she goes back to the village, Richie, I must remove her name from the ballot. [ RICHIE ] What a beautiful picture. Miss, would you mind moving? I'm trying to look at the skyline here. Thank you. Asshole. What time is your flight? 8:00 to Dubai. Three-hour layover. And then I got a direct flight to LA. Gotta sleep. I was going to tell you. Really. When it comes to men, I'm usually two steps ahead. [ RICHIE ] It wasn't supposed to end this way. That girl has talent. She has the gift. She has the magic. I know it. How the hell good am I if I can't break a talent like that? Honey, I saw the audience. They did not dig an uncovered Pashtun girl... singing Cat Stevens in English. Sweetness and light. I watched that crowd. They wanted to go with her. They were dying to go with her. They just weren't able to go with her because it was in public. You really believe that? I sure do. So? So... daddy bear took her out of the show, and she quit. Quit? You quit. It was that easy for you to walk away. First little bump in the road, and Mr. Richie's just giving up, slinking back to his little Van Nuys world. I don't think you know quite what you're talking about. Nah. I don't know shit. I know, 'cause my daddy told me that. "Merci, just shut up. Put on a tube top. Go find yourself a rich man while you still can." And for a long time, too long, I believed him. But you know what, Richie? I am not dumb. I'm gonna walk out of here with a serious nest egg... and open my own real estate agency in Oahu. Richie Lanz, I fought to be a winner, and I do not have time for quitters and losers. I am not a loser. I am a quitter. If you really know talent, and you really know that Salima's gonna win her way into the next round, then do something. Figure something out, man. I don't know. But win, goddamn it. God, you are really crazy about me, aren't you? I am your partner with this girl, but I bet on you, Richie. Not her. You. And you better deliver me my 30%. I got an idea. Of course you do, hon. It's a million-to-one shot. But so... were the Bay City Rollers. Hey. As-salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam. What do you say we keep Salima on the ballot? What? Well, who actually knows that she quit? I mean, officially. I know. My staff knows. Okay, but they don't know, right? On TV last night... there was her name on the ballot with a phone number to call. Yes. You know, if you haven't officially removed her from the ballot, don't. She's risked her life. Come on. It'd be great for her village, for her family, for her people, the nation, the world, women everywhere. Maybe. You know, probably. But I found this girl in a cave. And I heard her, and... I just got to know, man. I just got to know. And don't you wanna know? I already know. This conversation never happened, okay? Salima! Salima! Salima! [ WOMAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ CONTINUES ] [ SHOUTING ] [ HORNS HONKING ] [ SPEAKING PASHTO ] [ DAOUD SPEAKING DARI ] You okay? Oh, I think I'm bleeding somewhere. I am going to brain this guy. Salima Khan! Salima Khan! [ CHEERING ] [ GUNSHOTS ] [ TARIQ SHOUTING IN PASHTO ] Salima Khan! Salima Khan! [ FADES ] Salima Khan! Salima Khan! Salima Khan! Salima Khan! She did it! You did it! We're in! What? Salima Khan! Salima Khan! Salima Khan! [ WOMAN VOCALIZING ] Technically, the daddy did threaten to cut off my head. That was before his lambkin made it to the final round. Hey, he will put your head on a spike. Come on. Babe, please. Face-to-face? I own him. Everything all right? I have to go to work. Work? But you said that you retired. You-You said you discovered Madonna. I don't have a choice. None. So you're just gonna have to trust me on this, Richie. Or not. What kind of warlord throws a pool party on a weekday? So... you wanna say something? - Yeah. - Okay. Say it. What is a beauty like you doing with a goof like me? You never heard of "a Merci fuck"? [ HORN HONKS ] [ HONKING ] May I ask you one favor? Okay. Don't do the Marilyn wig thing with the scarves. Just save that for us. I feel like that was our special deal. I will see you tomorrow. I have a lot of emotion tied into it. [ BRIAN ] We are returning to the picturesque Pashtun village. Although without backup. But this time for twice my initial fee. You need a hook, Mr. Bombay. There's a million mercenary memoirs out there. I'm sorry. This is what I do. Yeah. What you do is talk shit. [ CELL PHONE: RINGTONE ] I could get you in a bidding situation. [ RIZA ] Miss Merci. House of pain. Me and this Pashtun girl, we're in the hot tub with two guys. Oh, Lord. With Azam Ghol and this... this Nizar. All right. Just give me the gory details. Richie, shut up. Listen to me. Those bullets that you sold to Salima's father... I don't know if they're, like, bad. They won't fire. They're old. Richie, it was all a setup. Do you hear me? You delivered the bad bullets for them. They used you, Richie. You were the fucking patsy. And Nizar's gonna kill Salima. He's a crazy man. He kept screaming about it. She's, like, a whore, an infidel, whatever. And you put her on TV, Richie. They're gonna fucking kill her. They're gonna kill her father, take over the village, and you've got to do something. Do you get it? Thanks for the tip, honey. See you soon. Gotta go. Richie? Richie? Slight change of plans. Let's go back to Kabul. What? We're not gonna go get her? What? Your handshake is your word. You shook her hand. You tell Salima that your word is bond. Richie, you are her manager. Shit. Stop. What? Just stop the car. Stop. Stop! [ ENGINE STOPS ] Hey! The fuck? What's happening? What the hell? I never discovered Madonna. [ RIZA ] What? I never handled a real headliner. I did have Eddie Money, but it was back when he was Eddie Mahoney. It was long before "Two Tickets To Paradise." I made a few bucks. I nailed a couple of hot publicists. But I also gave up a daughter I love. But, gentlemen, Riza is right. There are four sacred bonds in this life: A parent and child, a husband and wife, a priest and confessor... and manager-talent. What about doctor-patient? [ RIZA ] Or lawyer-client. Not sacred. [ SIGHS ] Now, Salima... is my act. She's mine. I am her manager. And my act needs me. Now. [ SPEAKING PASHTO ] [ RIZA ] "You stole my daughter." Yes. But you raised her. [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] And you raised her... - to honor and celebrate... - [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] your family, your country and your God. [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] And if you didn't truly believe that, wouldn't she be dead by now? [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] [ SPITS ] Hang on. It gets worse. [ SHOUTS IN PASHTO ] Understandable. We are your only chance. "We?" Yeah. There is no "we." I'm done with you. That's enough. When were you going to tell me? Was it a big surprise or something? Something you were gonna spring on me? It just hit me. This is your killer hook. This is your final chapter of your best-selling book, right here. Oh, my book. My book. You mean my posthumous book. The one that you're gonna make all the money off of... after these guys shoot me about a thousand times? There is no deal, Hollywood. [ RICHIE ] All right. All right. I never do this. If you ever tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it. But I'm gonna cut my fee. There'll be no Richie 35 on this one. There'll be Richie 15, and we're still both gonna do great. Because this is golden. Brian, you don't wanna be the guy... that left the Alamo. You are a piece of work. Thank you. My posthumous book... I wonder what you'll call it. Chief, this is for you. [ RIZA SPEAKS DARI ] [ BRIAN SPEAKS DARI ] In that truck is all the ammunition you will ever need. - [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] - And my bullets work. - Now come on back here with me. - [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] [ CHATTERING IN PASHTO ] [ BRIAN ] That's for you. Brand new. There you go. Careful with that. [ CHATTERING IN PASHTO ] [ WOMAN SPEAKING PASHTO ] [ MAN SPEAKING PASHTO ] - Thanks for not killing me. - [ RIZA TRANSLATING ] [ SPEAKING PASHTO ] What did he say? The day is not over yet. Pretty good. [ WIND WHISTLING ] Richie. Hi. In all the excitement, I forgot to congratulate you. [ SALIMA CHUCKLES ] You won. I told you. Yeah. And that was nothing. I had a killer arrangement for the finals. Strings. Gospel choir. Wall of sound. Huge. You would have won in a walk. Salima, honey, you were the best I ever heard. You saw it all. Well... [ CHUCKLES ] Except for this part. Richie, this, right now... This will be the best part. The dying part? [ CHUCKLES ] Not the dying part. The living. You... You folks from the mystic East... have a much better handle on the whole karma, life/death thing. Rumi writes, "There's a candle in your heart, ready to be kindled." There's a void in your soul, ready to be filled. "You feel it, don't you?" Richie. You will. I... I promise you will feel it. [ VOCALIZING ] [ VOCALIZING CONTINUES ] [ MAN ] Mama, take this badge off of me I can't use it anymore It's getting dark, too dark to see I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door This is nuts! I'm not a fighter. I'm a deal maker. I'm gonna go make a deal. You just gotta love this guy. [ CHUCKLES ] These guys have no idea what they're up against. Let me do the talking. Knock yourself out. - [ TARIQ SPEAKS PASHTO ] - [ RIZA ] "What are you doing?" I'm representing. I'm here to negotiate. And you? [ SPEAKING PASHTO ] "We are here to kill all unbelievers and the whore who sings." Okay. I'm hearing you. More of a deal breaker than a negotiation. Let's get serious. What's it gonna take for all of this to go away? [ SPEAKING PASHTO ] [ RIZA ] "Kill him. Kill this fool now." Okay. Very quickly. A key is to know what the other guy wants. You are a warlord. You want war, I suppose. Money. Power. Maybe opium. And in an ideal world... you'd like CIA and Taliban to both pay you to sell out your own country. You're a warlord. [ GUNFIRE CONTINUES ] [ BRIAN ] Stand down! Stand down! [ MEN SHOUTING IN PASHTO ] Anybody else wanna see how real bullets work? Richie, you're all right. It's a flesh wound. Walk it off. Let's go. [ VOCALIZING ] [ SALIMA ] Now I've been happy lately Thinking about the good things to come And I believe it could be Something good has begun Oh, I've been smiling lately Dreaming about the world as one And I believe it could be Someday it's going to come Cause out on the edge of darkness There rides a peace train Oh, peace train, take this country Come take me home again Now I've been smiling lately Thinking about the good things to come And I believe it could be Something good has begun Oh, peace train sounding louder Glide on the peace train Oh-ah-ay-ah-oh-ah Come on now, peace train Yes, peace train, holy roller Everyone jump up on the peace train Oh-ah-ay-ah-oh-ah Come on now, peace train Come and join the living It's not so far from you And it's getting nearer Soon it will all be true Peace train sounding louder Glide on the peace train Oh-ah-ay-ah-oh-ah Come on now, peace train I've been crying lately Thinking about the world as it is Why must we go on hating?

Thank you. I don't want string. I don't use string. Okay? Do I look like... Do I look like I use string? No, I want this thing here. I want the animal. Okay? Come on. For my kid. For my girl. Let's take a look. Come on. All right, what you got to have for this, five bucks? It's made in Taiwan. You didn't make this. You didn't make this. This was made by Chinese people in Taiwan. Five bucks good? We good? [ SPEAKING DARI ] If you're saying 10 bucks, I'm sorry. 'Cause I only got five bucks. It's all I got. You can't do it for five? [ SPEAKING DARI ] Here, man, take it. I'll find somewhere else for five, I promise you. [ SPEAKING DARI ] It's what I got. It's all I got. [ SPEAKING DARI ] Thank you so much. Thanks. Appreciate it. That's great. That'll be... All right, give me some string. Give me some... Here, I found five more bucks. Give me... Well, that's ugly. Give me... Give me that blue one. Which one... I don't need all of this. Which one's better? This one? Give me... That one's clean. Now it's mixed in there. That's the color. Which one's better, this or this? Which one? I'm taking that one. Between these two. [ SPEAKING DARI ] Ah. Ah. I just wanna take one of these. I want two of these. This one or this one? This one? I got that one. Here. [ MUFFLED ] This one or this one? [ SPEAKING DARI ] I'm gonna decide on my own. I've already put this one in my mouth. I'm keeping that one. And that reminds me of someone, and this is brand new and mysterious. So you keep that one. We'll call it square. [ SPEAKING DARI ] Oh. Okay.
