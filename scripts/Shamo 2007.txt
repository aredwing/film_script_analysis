Fraud and burglary. Imprisonment for 9 months. Shave your head... Fine. I'll do it myself. Sir, take care of this for me... The tape, too... Shut up! Narushima Ryo. You're the scum who killed your own parents? The Police was speculating that a murder took place. A couple is presumed to be stabbed by their son They were declared dead on the way to the hospital. Police received a call from the suspect at 9 o'clock this morning; he claimed he'd killed his parents... The police revealed the suspect is only 16 and he was still protected by Juvenile Law. Even if the Police collected enough evidence, it's hard to charge him, The Police also infer the suspect has either the violence tendency, or the mental illness. According to the specialist, nowadays, the youngster... You're bleeding. Warden... he was... They... Beat it. Because you are a juvenile, you will be released after two years. But there is nowhere in the world... that will accept you. Warden... Please... please help me. Even that human garbage despises you. Because you killed your parents. Why are you still surprised? This is not the first time you got bullied. In fact, it is still a kind of virtue. Narushima Ryo, your younger sister came to visit you. Natsumi. Do I look thinner? A little bit. You've changed. It's pouring. Why did you kill our parents? I don't remember anything. It's the police told me that you'd killed our parents. That's why I flunked out of school. Our apartment and money were taken by our relatives. I am going to work far away. What kind of job is it? Whore. I have no choice. It's all your fault. You can't work as a whore! Sit down! I'm not giving you my number or address. I don't want to see you again. Bye, Narushima Ryo. Natsumi! Natsumi! Natsumi... Piece of shit! Don't try to kill yourself. So much is waiting for you. Let's go! Who's this guy? A karate instructor? He seems more like a garbage collector. Listen! Listen... Queue up! Queue up! Who has studied karate before? Give me a straight fist punch. Those who haven't studied, follow my lead. Hold on. The second one... This is such nonsense. Even a karate student can't compete with me. Come on. Give me a punch. This is what a straight fist like. Keep practicing! Want to learn karate? Give me your hand. Bend your fingers with little finger first. And cover them with your thumb. Put it near your waist... Rotate and thrust This is a straight fist punch. Try it. Rotate and thrust Try again. Now, pair off and spar. You practice with 259. I can't beat him. How can you know how much energy you have in your fist? Come on... hit me... Get up. Hit back now. You want to practice the straight fist punch? You can still do it with your hands tied. Practice with heart. Practice with heart. With punches, progress is measured in thousands... Muscle memory starts at 1,000 repetitions. It becomes instinctive after 5,000. This is an extremely long night. You've got a lot of time. Your kicking needs work. Tonight, do 5,000 repetitions. It's slow. Slow still. Raise your knee real quick and point to the lower jaw. Kick! Faster! Brother Masa, it was just a misunderstanding. Fuck off! Don't think that we would afraid of you. Tonight, you're dead! In a fight, you should know your situation... whether you're encountering one or ten person. First of all, don't try to escape. If you do, you will lose for sure. Those who act first who win. Try to disperse them and beat them one by one. Finally, find the strongest one... and defeat him. Then, the others will be afraid of you. Mr Kurogawa, I wonder if you can help me... to defeat Narushima Ryo. The method is up to you. Why do you need my help? Mr Kurogawa. It seems you live in the martial world. But on the other hand, your conservative sentiment... made you empathize with that author who committed hara-kiri. You worried that this country would become westernized... and would quickly die out. At the time, you insisted... that you should do something for the country. That's why you assassinated the prime minister. Protect the prime minister! Master Kurogawa. You and I will fight. In this match, anything goes. You teach Narushima Ryo karate... because he reminds you of yourself You both committed an undeniable fault. You want to kill me? But Mr Kurogawa... Narushima Ryo shouldn't have survived. You know this clearly. Why do you want to kill me? I can't die here. Kill him and I help you to leave the prison earlier. There is no difference. You can't survive anywhere. Just a cock-fight. Who could have thought that... you can leave here? I wonder if it is because of karate. But Instructor Kurogawa isn't as lucky as you. Because he failed to do what he was told... he has been moved to a prison upstate. I believe this will be a cold winter. Are you afraid? You're afraid that because he didn't kill me, I will kill you What sort of nonsense is this? Why should I be afraid of you? Narushima Ryo... What do you want? Time's up. Wanna fight in the L. F? Can you handle it? Nobody can beat Sugawara Naoto. But you're so great... I guess you can. You win! And there is a 20 million reward. Then you can quit this job. You'll never have what Naoto's got Because you are Narushima Ryo. You know what you've done. I had enough of that in prison. Nobody can look down on me again. Nobody can treat me like that. No way! Narushima Ryo! This is for your dead parents! Or they would come to revenge on you! "Natsumi" "The top of this month Pretty girl Ranking" "Natsumi" Who is Natsumi? Natsumi? I am Natsumi. We have only one Natsumi here. I'm free at the moment. Let's do it here. Be quick. I'm not looking for you. Do whatever you want. Just give me extra money. Does it show? How can you hurt my face? I earn a living with it. This belongs to Natsumi? Is she your girlfriend? She is my younger sister. How long have you been looking for her? Did she run away from home? What's your name? Ryo. The client called and complained you had beat her. Are you insane? None of your business... Do you think you're the boss? You're just a gigolo- They took your bracelet. He is good at fighting... We can't beat him. Okay Fight. Go take a look. Okay. Film him. Get a close up. I recognize him. He killed his parents five years ago. Out! Here. Sugawara feels the commotion has affected his performance. After considering his complaint, we now announce that the match should be counted as invalid. A rematch will be scheduled next month! I'm sorry, Master. I made this rash decision. I don't think you're rash. Remember you're representing Banryu Group. Ryo! Ryo! Ryo... You're really unlucky this time. Ryo... Ryo! Sugawara Naoto... Damn it! Ryo! You... Your friend says that you're a pupil of Kurogawa. So what? You fight well. Just like Kurogawa I used to be a pupil of Kurogawa too. Do you want to fight? I do admire you. Please come by my martial club. He's the guy from last night. They all know you. I bet you never thought that you'd become famous. In such a notorious way. Keep practicing! You making fun of me? Am I making fun of you? If you're ballsy and capable... I can help you get back your dignity. How can you help me? I have some status in the karate world. If you become my follower, you will represent my club to fight in L. F... Or else, you simply don't have a chance. If I fight, it has to be Sugawara Naoto! You have to do it step by step. Why do you choose me? Since we are the same. Die-hard. I, Mochizuki Kensuke, is the only one... to decide who come to the L.F. stage. Don't salute him! "Yamazaki Ryuichi" Mr Yamasaki is the founder of New Banryu Group. I represent Banryu Group to pay a visit to you. Thank you. Mr Mochizuki! I wonder what is the difference... between New Banryu Group and our Group. Do you mind to show your straight fist punch? If you want to ask... Hourglass Stance. Straight Fist. Left and right straight fist punch Middle roundhouse kick! The trick of New Banryu Group... is to get beaten. Mochizuki! You should fight someone of your own status. Start! New Banryu Group? Ryo. If you beat him, you will represent Banryu Group to fight in L. F... Banryu Group has 120,000 students. While New Banryu Group has 50 only Besides I am the founder of L. F... You're not only humiliating the Association, but karate as well. You're not allowed to use the name Banryu from now on. I only lost once... I only lost once! Banryu isn't pursuing martial art spirit. You simply treat us as a tool. And throw us away like garbage. New Banryu Group is the only martial art club. Give it up. Or else you'll never practice karate again. I'll listen to what you have to say. Be quick. I'm in a hurry. Listen. Don't think that you're one of my students. For the opponent I'll tell you later. Call me when you've figured it out. I waited here to give you back the bracelet. How could you beat a woman? You're not a man. I've run away from home for 5 years. But nobody searched for me. I want to be your younger sister. Does it hurt? Like you care! Ranka is the champion of Thai boxing. Ryo can never win. You will ruin Banryu's reputation. Ryo... should have been killed by Ranka. In this case, Ranka will match against Naoto. Naoto will win for sure. The story will be that... Banryu took a murder in. And helped him to start over. Unluckily, he was killed in the arena. That way, Banryu's reputation is restored. The best thing is... I got an exclusive report on his death. You're the best... Ryo! It's great! We can fight now. We got it! You would have died from that punch. If he can't kill me, it's my turn to beat him. Hit me. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on... hold on! Hold on! You said you're practicing blocking. Wake up... Do you think you can beat me? I could have killed you. Did you tell people that you're my student? I didn't accept you at all. Do you think you can win with endurance? How can you give a powerful punch with this injury? You're such an idiot. How can I teach you? I don't need your guide. I can't learn from you anyway. You have to wear gloves in L. F... With it, you can never apply what you've learned. You have to learn how to attack your opponent at a specific point. What're you doing? Split the moon. Lunatic... How can I do it? If you can do it... you may have chances to beat Ranka You can use whatever method will work. Are you kidding? How can I do this! What is this for? Use your wits. I have my own methods to win. Up to you. Why did you insist on teaching me karate? It suits you. Who could've thought that you can fight in L. F? You fill with pride finally. Fujiyoshi. From today onward, you're my manager. Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your eyes wide open... to witness this special fight of the century! A lot of people out there? Sold out. How am I today? You're cool. Ryo... come on the stage now. Get that bastard! Narushima of the Banryu is now entering the stadium! The crime scene is in a wealthy residential district. The police said the suspect is only 16. He was wearing a private school uniform... when the police found him. He had bloodstains on his clothes. The suspect seems to be mentally stable. The police said the suspect is only 16. and he was still protected by Juvenile Law. Even if the Police collected enough evidence, it's hard to charge him, Get the hell out of here. Murderer! Just listen to the audience's reaction! One thing is for sure! Narushima doesn't seem to have any fans here at all! No one is going to forgive him for what he has done in the past! I personally have no idea why the Banryu Group... would have allowed a murderer like him to enter the L.F. circle... You have to win. You have to win! Do we need to call Kurogawa? Please welcome the fighter of the blue corner, the strongest Muay Thai boxer Ranka Kasamolida! He might not be very popular in the L.F. circle, but he has used his iron fists to help dozens of his family in Thailand just the opposite of our murderer fighter Narushima. This is definitely the fight of good against evil! In the red corner, at 172 cm height, and 76 kg, Narushima! Murderer! Fuck off! Bastard! In the blue corner, at 170 cm and 80kg, Muay Thai figher, Ranka Kasamolida! To the center! OK? No head butting! No elbows. and no kicking to the groin! Understand? Are you two ready? Fight! This is great! This is great! Ryo! Now they're back on the stage and ready to fight. If you do that again, you are out! Fight! Great! Open blow... I don't know what you're talking about. That's a palm strike. Hold on! Hold on! Ryo! Hold on! Ryo, you can do it! You count and I'll beat you... What's the matter with you? All your efforts these days are wasted? Or you are a waste yourself? You're a waste. Since all your teaching is useless. If I didn't practice my endurance, how can I get into this round? Hit with speed. Don't break any more rules, okay? Fight! Beat him! Beat him! It's too late now. How can you have any strength all beaten up like that? The kick means nothing. Can you carry on? Are you OK? Target his vital parts. You got him! Got him! Calm down! Calm down! Come up! Come up! Take him away! Got him! Ryo was great! You got him! Because of that terrible accident, the judge has declared that the match is invalid! What's wrong with you! He has won for sure... You're crazy! What do you mean invalid? Did you see? Let me go! Come on! According to the diagnosis, Ranka's right eye will lose the sight forever. He will be forced to end his career. Though Narushima didn't break any of the rules, he seriously violated the spirit of the match. L.F. isn't a battlefield. That's why the match is invalid. I will never allow... this kind of ruthless fighter... to stand in the L.F. arena. Get down. Have you noticed that this city has changed a lot? Did you think I wouldn't make it? I am the one who called the police I know. In our society... we can't forgive assassinating the prime minister. I have no choice. But do this for Banryu. You betrayed me to keep the association, so that you can run this idiot L.F. matches? Sugawara Naoto is an unusual talent. At the time I accepted him to be my student, he had nothing... but a disabled old father. A martial artist should not suffer from poverty. They should have their own social status. L.F. helps them to create themselves. What a great speech. In fact, you're using Ryo. You wanted him to die on stage. At last, you got everything for yourself. You should... pay me back something. How do you feel? Are you afraid? What's to be afraid of? It's pointless now. What's the point of a star? You're just a woman. Call your boyfriend. I am Ryo. What do you want? Did you find the number familiar? Know who this is? Don't touch me! Get out of here! Get out of here! That's right. Louder. So that your boyfriend will know what'd happened. Get out! Don't touch me! Moemi! I've had your girl. Do you want to fight me? See you in L. F... I'm ready now. Didn't you say we'll both do her? I didn't touch her at all. What should I do then? Get up! Don't try to hurt him! Master! Master... Master... You will never see the world clearly. Maybe you can learn to smell bank notes. Master, I'm sorry. Master, I got to fight against Narushima Ryo. Please make an exception. Okay. But you should kill him in the arena. You old codger, what are you carving? There must be some master-strokes. You must teach me. What's wrong? Are you afraid? Don't be afraid. It is no point to be afraid. You will lose for sure. Nonsense! Inject this. It's some kind of steroids. But there are health consequences. First of all is the liver and then heart... followed by the brain, your nerves... delusion, depression, hallucination psycho mania. All kinds. Do you know what your only advantage is? It's your vicious nature. Come on! Fight with me! Fight with me! I asked you to fight with me! Why don't you help him? Don't be afraid. I got them to fight with him. He said he wants to practice. Who are you looking for? Hello? Who are you? Are you Mommy? It's alright. You will be fine. My hand is broken. How can I fight with Naoto? If I wasn't rescuing you, would this have happened? How can you blame the world? Why don't you take responsibility? Why did you bother the L. F? It's great to be a gigolo. At least nobody is hurting you. We all have our roads. Why did you bother Naoto? You can't even beat me now! Bastard! He is your best friend! You deserve this! Ryo, what the hell are you doing? Do you really want to win? Why did you bring me here? Old codger! The match is coming. But you know nothing still. You should overcome your fear. You should... strike! Sneak attack? It is called "Ahead". Your kick is powerless. You feel pain. Sense is something for yourself. You can feel it whatever way you want. Forget your injury and you won't feel pain. People can see you in the light. In that way, everybody can attack you. If you keep yourself inside the dark, and live alone, you can do whatever you want when nobody notices. Why did you stop? Are you afraid of the consequences? You got released from prison because you're terminally ill. It's none of your business. Listen, you're society's garbage A scumbag who killed his parents! Never regret. If you regret, that means what you've done is wrong. Keep going and you can never find the truth. Kurokawa Kenji Natsumi. She overdosed and got taken to hospital. It is a kind of anti-psychotic. They don't know if she was trying to get high or commit suicide. How come you are staying with her? In fact, I've been looking for her. For you. Yesterday she was rushed into hospital. The police told me all this. She doesn't even remember Ryo now. The doctor said she's had a mental illness record since childhood. Natsumi. $1500. Deal or no deal? Don't tell our parents. Your brother won't tell them. The guy who stole the drugs went down this hallway. It's him! Stop fighting! Don't hit him any more! Go away! Daddy, go away! Daddy, don't touch me... Back off or I'll kill... Ryo, don't. After I beat Sugawara, we'll never be despised by others. In the black corner, at 172 cm height, and 76 kg, Narushima! And in the White corner, at 185 cm height, and 90 kg, Banryukai's Sugawara Naoto! Fight! Narushima launches into Sugawara... but can't break his perfect guard! Narushima is down. It looks like he is having some serious trouble! Stop it! Stop it! Stay back! Back to your corner! Fight! Narushima is just like Sugawara's punching bag! He can't even lift his hands! Are you okay? Stay awake! Can you hear me? I need you to sit up! Come on. Stay awake! The doctor is coming to check your wound! Come on, sit right up! OK, Stay there. Your brow ridge is broken. The match should end here. It's fine. Let's continue. Brother... Natsumi. Natsumi... Natsumi. Can you fight? OK, come on. Fight! The winner by knock out is Sugawara Naoto! Ryo! Brother... Ryo!
