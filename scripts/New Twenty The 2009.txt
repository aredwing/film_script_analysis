Lose some weight, fat boy! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! FUCK YOU! Fuck! Shut up! Hey! Sorry. Oh. President Bush is spying on me. Yeah. I'm corresponding with a soldier in Iraq - That's why.

Ahhhhh! Jesus. Did you hear about Fischbach? Who? Keg out the window, freshman year. Oh, yeah. What's he up to? He had that web-based software company. Right. Google bought it. No shit. Yeah. It's a fluke. Most of these things are like hobbies. - Yeah? - What? I mean... ...it's like you said at the Moroccan, man. My fucking job is like shriveling me. Ahhh! What is this guy up to? Fuck! I suck at this fucking game! What the fuck are you morons looking at? Fuck off! Asshole. Thanks, man. I hate my fucking job. - Ditto, more or less. - Yeah, well... At least you guys sold out. Life in the blogosphere not what it used to be? Blow me, Hatch! What about you, Jules? Quiet desperation? I'd quit, but they keep promoting me. What? It's true. Bullshit. You love all that power. That's your fantasy. Hey, hey. No fighting. Is this our mid-life crisis? Yeah, if you die at 60. Well, 30 is the new 20... So what? He dies at 42? Basic math. My point is - therefore a crisis. We'll find out shortly. Oh. I got it. What's this? What is it? It's a celebration. Did you guys get that apartment? I want that place so bad. Guys, I have an announcement. Yes! Julie and I decided to do it... We're getting married. What? That is awesome! I can't believe you didn't tell me! - I can keep a secret. - Since when? Mazeltov. - Pour it up! - Let's do it! When did you propose? Halftime at the football game. Let's not talk about it. Did you get on one knee? I did. I was cute about it. So... a toast. Yes. To Julie. And Andrew. Julie Andrews! Wait a minute. She's not pregnant is she? - No, she's not. - Oh, stop it. I wanted to tell everyone together because, you know... ...that's how it is. Hey. Where are you? No, no. I'll come get you. Bachelor party! Hoo, hoo, hoo! Oh, please. What do you mean oh, please? I wouldn't mind. Seriously? Which one is he? The one next to my brother. Cute. Smart, right? Too smart. As in self-destructive and totally damaged? Well... Uh oh. What? "I'd quit... ...but they keep promoting me. " You got a problem with that? What if I do? We'II, I guess we'll have to work it out. Whatcha doin'? Goin' out. - Drive safe now. - Have fun. Are you okay? Excuse me. Felix. Where are you, man? I'm at the gym. Squash. Tuesday night, remember? Never fuckin' fails. There's two of us here and we're on top of each other. Do I know you? Did we play on the ladder together? I saw you on the court the other day. Oh, yeah? Yeah... You were a complete fuckin' asshole. Well, fuck you, too. Motherfuck! You wanna give me that ball? - You ready? - Yes. Shit! - You ready? - Yes. Shit! Shit! You gay? I mean, on the low down? Down low? Whatever. I mean, I'm just checking... 'cause the last five times I was in here some guy... ...exposed himself to me, if you know what I mean. I mean, hey, I'm all for sexual liberation... ...but for fuck's sake - I'm just tryin' to get some steam! So what do you do for a living, if you don't mind my asking? Investment banking. Hey, nothin' wrong with I-banking. I did my years on the street. Oh, yeah? Traded with Salomon back in the day. So who're you with - Merrill? Morgan. My fiance's with Merrill. That's cozy. Who makes more money? She does, doesn't she? Hey... I admit it. I go too far. It's my nature. Hell, it's part of my fuckin' job description. V.C. Venture capital. Hey, babe. Sorry. Louie, my fiance. Julie, this is Louie. Hello. Pleasure. Louie here's a venture capitalist. Oh. So you have my card? I do. Give me a call if you want to play again. Very nice to have met you, Julie. You meeting Andrew tomorrow? Nah. He's playing Louie again. Who the hell is that guy? I don't know. They met in the locker room. I know. I'm having trouble computing that totally gay fact. All right. You got a point, big boy. I mean, most of these things are like hobbies. But I've got an actual business model. This isn't just contextualized advertising. I know. I see your point. So what are you saying? You don't think it'll fly? Well, that depends on you. What are you doing right now? You got time to talk? Andrew's heard this a million times. You've gotta tell him. Yeah, come on. Tell it. So... He's asking all the usual bullshit... "What's your greatest failure?" "What's your greatest success?" You know, that kind of thing. Totally not listening. He's lookin' at the ceiling, starin' at his watch. Completely bored. So then, all of a sudden, he looks at me and says... "Do you have any tattoos?" Nice. I have no idea what he's thinking. But he's listening for the first time. So I look at him and I say... "Well, yes, Rick. I do have one. Right across here... And it says Merrill Lynch. No! You didn't. I totally did. And it got me the fucking job! Men are pigs. Oink. So? What do you think? I think you hate your job and you really want to do this. What about the apartment? Maybe it's not the right time to buy. No. It is. Okay. Well, I mean... I could swing the mortgage... ...for a while. Yeah? That would be great. I mean, I haven't decided decided. But... that could be great. Ow, ow! - Sorry. - Wait. Hey. - Yeah? - What's the story? What? In the steam room... the disdain. Excuse me? I'm Tony. Robert. - Hey. - Hey. So you some kind of hot shot? Some kind. You have tenure? I do. Cozy. And do you talk when you teach? I do. Awesome. How about you? The teacher... The... work thing, I mean. I'm a total sellout. Oh, I doubt that. You guys know what you want? I want him to talk more. Another drink. "Friends. " No, we didn't pay our cable bill. Maybe this is how they punish us. Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill. Free phone sex. Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill. It's the students... The students continually surprise me. In class? Not so much. Well, yes and no. You have a limited view of them in class, is the thing. You don't see them operating... ...with their whole selves in there. They withhold that. But when you do see that... I mean, for example... ...if you have a student in class who doesn't talk much... ...and that's how you know her or him... And then you see her in a performance... ...as a musician... ...or you see her as an athlete. Or maybe you get invited to a dinner... ...and there's something in the conversation... ...that surprises you... Some joke, some remark. And suddenly you realize you're teaching human beings there. Full human beings. Not that you didn't know that... No, no. Sure. And when that happens... ...it redeems the whole thing. What? You're talkin' finally. Yeah. I'm talkin' finally. Very nice. Thanks. You want a drink? Uncomfortable silence. Yeah. I'm positive. Bummer. I'm healthy. My viral loads are undetectable. Felix! Hi, this is Robert. I'm not in right now, but you know what to do. Robert. It's me, Tony. Are you there? Listen, um... I'm sorry that I freaked like that. It's just, uh... Whatever, you know... Just give me a call, okay? Seriously, Jules. Why do you worry about me so much? Gee, I wonder. I'm fine. You, on the other hand. - What? - What? 'Cause I'm marrying Andrew? I didn't say that. You didn't have to. Oh, I'm just jealous. That's all. It's true, I am. I wish I was Andrew. He's the alpha dog. Me, I'm just... A jerk? Stop. Hey... I am very happy that you're getting married. You know I love Andrew. And I love you, too. I mean it. Thank you. Come on. Let's walk. I gotta get to work. It's Saturday. Freelance, baby. Database design. Hey, do you guys want to go out later? I can't do that anymore. Can't do what anymore? Get high every weekend. I don't get high every weekend. Hey. Hmmm? Do you maybe want to hang out sometime? Aren't we? I mean outside of this room. Oh... a bold idea. I realize that. We could get lunch. Okay. What is it? What's the matter? Nothing. No, it's just... Did you brush your teeth? What? The bleeding. Oh. No. It's mouthwash. Sorry. I thought... It's okay. Hey, man. How's the professor? Okay. Fuck buddy or soul mate? - Too soon to tell. - Really? How's 'Last Tango'? She have a name yet? Nah. Oh, come on. Lucy. Lucy! I like that name. Lucy... Lucy, Lucy! Fuck off. Give me a break! What do you mean? You wouldn't make it through Basic! You think it's like Full Metal Jacket? 'Cause I don't wanna be the guy... ...who shoots himself in the urinal. He's on the toilet. Whatever. He's in the bathroom. Why don't you do something with your languages already? Languages? He's a fucking genius at it. Picks 'em up like that. Is he gay, too? Don't ask, don't tell. Fuck you all! Where 'da party at? All right. This is it. Very nice! Sweet! - What'd I tell you? - I love it. All right, gentlemen. What are we drinking? Scotch! That's a banana. A toast... To Andrew's new venture. Hear, hear. Andrew and Louie's new venture. That's right. I think it's fuckin' awesome! So when're you hiring? I thought you were in the army. He's AWOL already. So you're talking seed money. He develops the product, generates some interest... ...and then we go from there. I don't know, man. It's a hard sell. What is it? Data tracking? Data tracking history for retailers. Snore. I could sell that. I'd make a fuckin' awesome salesman! Think about it. I'm so smooth. You gotta sex it up, man. Give it a little sass. Yeah! Tony's the one you should hire. He's in advertising. Just a thought. "He's in advertising. " It's kind of Jeff Koonsy. You know, the guy who married the porn star - ...does all that kitschy stuff. Oh, yeah. - Hey. - Hey. So listen. What? My point is... What, man? What's your point? I wanna be part of a real team, you know? Making it happen. A company of men. That's gay. Seriously, man... Whoa! This is like a privileged moment here. Irony free. Very rare. I hear you. I may not have the CV... ...the background, whatever. But what you get from me... ...is total dedication, total loyalty. A fucking brilliant mind! I don't even know what to do with it half the time. You guys want coffee? Check it out. Louie's got this beast of a machine. Makes kick-ass cappuccino. Sounds good, man. Crank it up. Also... I don't care how late I work. I will sleep in that office. There is something I've been meaning to talk to you about. Oh, yeah? I mean, about this whole wedding thing. Julie and I, we were wondering if... What? We were wondering if... ...you'd be our best man. Fuckin' hell. Fuckin' hell, man. Of course I would! I'd be fucking honored! That is awesome! - Fucking awesome! - Easy, man. Awesome! You gonna throw me a kick-ass bachelor party? Hey, man. The most kick-ass party of all time! I am all over that! Ben? Yeah. You asked Ben to be our best man? Yes. Tony is our best man. We agreed. I know. He's my brother! He could be your maid of honor. That is so not funny. I thought it was pretty funny. Come on, Jules. Ben was talking to me about the business... Oh, what? And you felt guilty? No. Yeah, whatever. Tony... Tony what? Hey. What? I emptied two drawers for you. Ah, honey. Is that me? Uh, yeah. Tony? You awake? I got a proposition for you. So Ben as head of sales, huh? Oh, now he's head of sales now? - That's what he told me. - Jesus! I thought you were going to gently disillusion him. I tried! The guy's fucking impervious to hints. This is it. It's, uh... Cheap! Shut up. All right. Here we go. Check that out. Now... Louie's gonna bust my balls for this. But since it's you, I'm caving. Twelve percent equity. Twelve is not thirteen. It ain't ten either. True. Get over here. Hey! There he is. What's goin' on? - So this is it, huh? - Yeah. I like it. Tight ship, no waste. Sends the right signal to the investors. Just made him the offer. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Shit. Are you kidding me? Come on, man... No! That's bullshit! You are talking twelve percent! That's insane! You have got to fight for every goddamn point of that equity... ...because everyone's gonna want a piece. Trust me. Tony's worth it. Why? Is he gonna blow us every night after work? Me? Yeah. You? I doubt it. Fuck you and that prissy little faggot. Oh, now you wanna fuck him! That's thirteen percent. Hey! He is not your friend, okay? He is your business partner. And as such, he gets ten percent. With or without the blow job! Please don't tell me that I have made a fucking mistake. Hey. Wait... Listen to this. # Don't be kind tonight # # My heart so longs for it # # That it might fall # # I want so much more from you # # Than you can give... # Look at the daffodils. Dot dot dot. I'm having second thoughts about Andrew. What? I'm not sure about it. I thought you were all set with that. Yeah, I was. What happened? I overheard Andrew and Louie... ...and Louie called me a faggot... What? And Andrew sort of defended me. Sort of? It's not that big of a deal, okay? That's not the issue. So what's the issue? I don't know! That's the thing. I just know that I don't want to be a part of this 'team' thing. I don't need that. Then don't do it. Fuck! That's game. What? Come on. Don't rush me. I have my ways. Ha, ha! Let's play. There you go. Thanks, man. Barr! Move your lazy ass! I wanna see some hustle! God, I hope we can find something for him to do... ...once we're up and running, you know... ...and we can afford a little deadweight. Yeah. I'm so fuckin' excited! We are gonna storm this fuckin' beach! Did you check out the contract? I did. Everything up to par? Looks fine. Couple typos is all. Trust you to catch those, you anal bastard. Hey, Andrew. What? There's something I need to tell you, man. You're gay. I know. Barr! Tony's gay! No. Listen. I know that it's late in the game... ...but I don't think I can join you after all. What? You're not serious. No. I'm serious. What is it? The contract? I busted my balls for that twelve percent! No, it's not that. Then what? What is it then? The timing's not right. It's nothing personal. What the fuck are you talking about? It's just the choice I've made. It's just the choice you've made? What's the matter with you? What? I have a cold. What? Bullshit! That is total fucking bullshit! You don't got the balls to do it - ...that's what this is about. It's just the choice I've made. "It's just the choice I've made. " Fuck you! No fuck you, you... What? Prissy little faggot? Oh, you heard that? Yeah, I heard that. Big fuckin' deal, man. Yeah, big fuckin' deal, man! Louie didn't want to give you that twelve percent. I got you that. I fought for that! Well, I don't need it. You don't need it? That it? You're an asshole. Maybe you should talk to him again. No. He's not here. Housewarming present. Come on in. It's a limited edition. It's adorable. Thank you. You're... You're welcome. He ought to be careful... ...leaving a woman like you unattended. So cheesy. Well, you're too smart. Bullshit. A 'Harvard man' like you? Big deal. I could've gone there. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hey. Hey. You missed Louie. He stopped by with a housewarming present. Jaime called me in today. It looks like I might get that promotion. Congratulations. Fuck! You gonna get this server up and runnin' or what? We need that I.T. guy. How's that rewrite comin'? It's in the printer. Great. Bunch of fucking amateurs. Total dick. Yo, yo, yo, Andrew. It's your point man on sales. What's up, man? I'm just calling about my start date. I know we said a few months. But I wanna let you know... ...if you need me sooner, I am there. You know what, man? It depends on when we get our first sale. Sounds good. Just so you know... I'm ready... I'm willin'... ...and I'm waitin'. I hear you. So, um... ...have you talked to Tony yet? No. Well, I will get you back on that squash court! I believe it. You know it. Look, man, I gotta run. Someone's callin' me on the other line. Okay. That's cool. I'll catch you later. Hey. Hey. Listen... Louie wants to buy us dinner - ...for my promotion. But I told him there's no way you could make that. I did say we could meet for a drink. Ten-ish? At his place? Can you make that? Sure. Yeah. And if you need to, you can go back to work. Sounds like a plan. All right. I'll see you later. Congratulations. Thanks. So what are you now? Vice President? It's just a quota. Every bank needs one sexy Asian chick. Bullshit. What time is it now? Hey, he's a hard-workin' boy. Aren't we all? Shit. How was the doctor? Ah, the doctor. The doctor was fine, and so am I. And if I wasn't, I'd tell you. Okay. I can read your mind, you know that? You're thinking... What a fuckin' drag... I have to be with this guy. No. I'm not. You're not? No. Okay. You're not. I got the offer from Berkeley. I'm gonna take it. Tony? Are you sure you're okay? Just a touch of existential malaise... ...courtesy of late capitalism. You know, the usual. Ow! What the fuck is wrong with you? I was jealous of you in college. Did you know that? What? Why? Because you wanted it. You were hungry for it. It? You know what I mean. Oh, yeah. You mean a life of the mind. Hey. What are you doin' here? Do I need a reason? Excuse me. He's pissed because I let him fall asleep on the roof. Total baby! He doesn't look good. So? What's the matter with you? Robert and I broke up. Oh. Whatever. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Um... what happened? We broke up. That's what happened. He got an offer from Berkeley. He's leaving anyway. That's too bad. I liked him. You met him like, once. I liked him anyway. Hey. # I don't wanna ride this rollercoaster # # I think I want to get off # # but they've buckled me down # # like it's the end of the world # # If you don't wanna have this conversation # # then you better get out # # "cause we're climbin' to our death # # At least that's what they want you to think # # Just in case we jump the track # # I have a confession to make # # It's something like a corkscrew # # I don't wanna fall # # I don't wanna fly # # I don't wanna be dangled over the edge # # of a dying romance # # But I don't wanna stop # # I don't wanna lie # # I don't wanna believe it's over # # I just wanna stay with you tonight... # Okay... Okay. How's Lucy? It's over. - What? - Yep. Really? How come? She wanted more. And you wanted less. Yeah, that's right. No apologies. That's too bad. I liked her. You never met her. I liked her anyway. Hey, it's Ben. I'm thinkin' about going to the gym later. I'm in Chelsea. Call me if you guys want to hang out. All right. Bye. Now I send him just comedies. 'Cause I mean, where they are - what they're going through - ...they don't need to watch the dark stuff, you know? Yeah. Sure. My theory is - suffering's like water. It's like, whatever container water fills... ...it fills it evenly, you know? Everywhere. Does that have a name? Yeah. It seeks its own level. It seeks its own level. And that's how suffering is. It fills the space. Whether it's shallow or deep - it's everywhere, you know? Yeah. And it's like, what I'm trying to say is... ...if life... ...if life is suffering no matter what we do, why don't we just... ...do something worthwhile, you know? Sure. I'm all pissed off because my friends... ...won't return my phone calls. How pathetic is that? It's not pathetic. No? You love them. It's been my pleasure listening to you unburdening yourself. You're a good listener. How would you like a blowjob from an old cowboy? Here? This is Andrew. What's that? I'm sorry. It's noisy here. Nobody use it. Louie? Guess what. Call the investors. Tell them we're in business. Yeah. I got our first client. I'll tell you all about it. Give me two minutes. I've got to call Julie. Fuck, yeah! Yes! Can you fuckin' believe it? Are you serious? I know it's just one sale, babe, but it's the first. So we're gonna celebrate. I want you to get everyone together. Everyone? Why the hell not? Okay. Look, hon. I got to run. Go, go. Hey, did you get my message? Yeah. You'll come, won't you? I'm not the one who made a big deal out of it. Andrew is. Well, he's over it. Well, fantastic. So you'll be there? Yes, I will be there. Good. Thank you. Wait. Louie's not gonna be there, is he? No. God, no. Okay. I'll see you later. All right. Later. A toast, a toast! Listen! To our man, Andrew. Hear, hear. Now we all know it is easy to make fun of Andrew. I mean, let's face it. Enthusiasm is so not cool... ...and Andrew is nothing if not enthusiastic. Hoo, hoo, hoo! But let us also not forget that enthusiasm takes courage. The kind of courage that us lesser - ...albeit much cooler men - ...can only mock. So, all mocking aside... Andrew, my friend... You did good. And we're proud of you. Thanks. Cheers. Bottoms up. Let's go to a titty bar. You know, I miss kickin' your ass... ...all over that court. Yeah, you got lucky once or twice. Oh, I got lucky! I told you I'd get you back on that court - ...did I not? - Yes... - Did I not? Yes! You did! What else are you gonna do for me? Get out of here. You work for the city! Come on, man! What? What? Um... What? I love you. Yo, Louie! It's Ben. Remember me? Of course I do, man. What's up? Well, as you may or may not know... I am Andrew's best man. And as such, I have certain duties. Oh, yeah? In a word - Yes. For example, bachelor party. Yeah, well, I know a thing or two about that. Can you make that happen? Yeah, man. I'd be happy to help. That's fantastic. Jesus fucking Christ. Piece of shit! Hey, sexy. Hey, beautiful. Did you order food? No. All right, bro. Come on! There's no escape. What's going on? Is Tony here? No. It's your boy's big night, that's all. Okay, buddy! Shoes on. Now! Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated! Felix, what is this? No, man. You better just do as he says. Get the loafers! No time for laces! I have no idea, babe. Don't worry. We'll take good care of him. Maybe we'll get out early. Anyone else coming? No, buddy. More to go around. Do it up! Because I'm smooth! I'm fucking SMOOTH! Yeah, baby! Who's the lucky one? Fucking genius... I know. That's the best thing about the fall of the Iron Curtain. Take that shit off! Felix, where are you going? He doesn't know, man. Yeah! Yeah, baby! Nice. Felix, What are you doin'? It's my party. Wuff, wuff, wuff! Ben is a dog. Wuff, wuff, wuff! Let him get a blowjob from some hooker. Really? Did you believe that? - No. - Neither did I. Can we change the fucking subject? All right. Let's talk about your addict friend then. He's not an addict. You could've fooled me. He's not an addict. - He is, dude. - Bitch, he's not. Why that? Did you see that? No more wine for you. Okay. Where we goin'? This way. Don't worry. They don't bite. I don't know, man... Compliments of the house. This is your big night, bubba. Right? This is your get-out-of-jail-free card. This is what it's all about. That's what you came here for. Hey... Felix. You know what would be totally cool? If you joined Andrew's company with me. And then we'd all be like... What? Don't you get it, man? Andrew's not gonna hire you. Of course he is. No, man. He hired a headhunter... ...for marketing and sales. Seriously? He's a dick. Hey, wake me up when the chicks come back. Hey. I am not slurring. You are! No, no, no. It's bullshit! That's what it is. What is? What I said. Now that we're all on the same page. What are you talking about? Oh! The stripper I ordered! It's Felix. What's up? What is it? What? What is it? I think he said he's stuck. He is such a freak. Are you at Louie's? Where is everybody? Hey, Felix, are you there? Can you hear me? Hello? Felix? Shit. What is going on? - What did he say? - Hold on. Shit. - Why is he alone? - I don't know. I thought you said he doesn't do... He doesn't! - I'm going with you. - Is that a good idea? Oh, my God. Hey. What are you guys doing here? Where's Felix? I don't know. Is he like, passed out somewhere in this apartment... ...and you don't even know it? If I don't even know it, how could I answer that? Where's Andrew? Felix? Hey, Felix. Are you in there? Shit. Who the hell is that? Julie? I need some help here! Oh, God. Is he breathing okay? I think so. Maybe we should lift him out. Is that a good idea? - What do you suggest? - I don't know! Felix! Can you hear me? Hey. Can you hear me? Why did you let him? Let him what? Shut up and help us! - Holy shit! - Watch his head! On his side, not his back! - Why? - Jimi Hendrix! He's looking blue. I'm calling an ambulance. Wait! Why? Don't call 911! He's worried about the police. Call the fire department. Felix! Come on! Help me! Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha! Hey, man. - Can you hear me, dude? - Felix, wake up. Heroin. No. I'm not sure how much. Yes. I think so, yes. Felix, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Bunch of fucking teenagers! Felix, it's me. I'm here, okay? Stay with me, okay? Get a towel! I slept with Louie. Hey, Felix. We'll see you at the hospital, all right? Lie down. You comin'? Andrew? Ben? I'll see you there. You forgot your shoes... Asshole. Have a seat, man. So... I've thought about this. Well, I'm sure you have. I'm here to do business with you. Okay. I hear Matt and Samantha quit. I'm better off without them. You know, you can't manage for shit. Excuse me? I'm cutting my losses. Cappuccino? No, thanks. Hey! Call me when you get there. I will. So... Yeah. All this fucking emotion. Numbness was better. I like you like this. Yeah. Hey. Who are these guys? Old friends. College. Would you like an espresso? Sure. So would I. Piece of shit. Tony's room is open if you want it. You're not serious. Why not? I could think of a few reasons.
