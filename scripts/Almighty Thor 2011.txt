All off his radial bows! Fire at the ready! Stand your ground in the name of Odin! Fire! [Screaming] This portends to be an evil day. Baldir? Why did the Norns summon father? The weavers of fate will tell father soon enough. Now hurry. The gate will be closed soon. [Rumbling] Father! Some evil is upon us. I must go see the Norns. We'll go with you, father. I must do this alone. You return to the safety of Valhalla. Come on. Hurry, or the gate will close. Come on. Send them deep into Hell! So their doom has spread its plume. And none too soon. And none too soon. It is a dark day, Odin, King of Asgard, that we summon you here to see us. I would come for no one else. Now speak your minds and be done with it. I have dreamt of the stars in the sky turning black. What does this mean? It is a countdown. A countdown to what? Have you brought the Hammer of Invincibility? This Hammer was forged by my father from the center of the Tree of Life. His power is in this Hammer. That Hammer is the only weapon that can kill the mighty tree it came from. The source of life on which the mortal earth and all other worlds depend. Now Loki has arrived to take that life. So you must give the Hammer of Invincibility to him. To Loki? Never. The time has come for Ragnerok. Before the Sun goes down this day it will be the destruction of all worlds. Of Asgard, Earth, and all the other worlds as well. And you are powerless to stop it. We'll see about that. Thor, come on. Is this fate? Destroy one world... then weave another. That is how it's done. Your doom is decided... And the fall of your kingdom has already begun. I don't believe in fate. [Growling] Find me the Hammer of Invincibility, my Garmr, and this world will be yours to control. Onward to Valhalla. [Blows warning] To arms! To arms! Invasion! Someone approaches from the north! Drop the gates now! Wait! We don't have to listen to them. We can weave our own fate. We can control our destiny. That is why you are the younger brother. We can't give up. A God of the Aesir never gives up. I will face my own death with honor and dignity, and I suggest you do the same. Enough! I want to see Odin! Odin will never speak to you. I want the Hammer of Invincibility. The Hammer is not yours to take. Odin! Odin! I want the Hammer! Our fate is upon us. You two fly at the creatures to the left. I'll cut down through the center. We'll meet in the middle. Yes, father. Yes, father. You stay back behind your brother. But father, I can fight. I'm not afraid. No, son. I question not your heart, but your experience. I need you at the end of the battle. I need you for the finish. Yes, father. Valor and strength. Valor and strength. Valor and strength. Valor and strength. Thor! Where is Thor? He was by my side, I swear. Suddenly he was gone. I wanted to die with both my sons. Odin! Loki! Do not think I'll lie and die for you. You can't stop the future, Odin. Give me the Hammer. You know it's your fate. Just give me the Hammer, Odin. Just give me the Hammer. We don't have to go through this, and I'll go away. I'll just go away. Loki! No! No! No! No! My son! Father... Give Thor a chance... To change... Our fate. Finally now it's mine. You want this? Back where you came! Tell me. Tell me where you sent it! Find it. Search every cave, every tree in Asgard. Now. [coughing] No! No! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Brother? What should I do? Father! Father. Thor. Live. You live. Yes. Where's your potion of healing, father? No. Where's your potion? There's not time for that, my son. It's too late. Don't waste it. Use it for another cause. My father's Hammer... I sent it... to the heart of the Tree of Life. My son... must alone retrieve it... before Loki. Forget the Hammer, father. It's Loki I want, to avenge your death. My brother's. My son... you still think with your heart, not your mind. The Hammer will appear... on the first full moon... Tomorrow... For a moment. If you don't retrieve it, it's lost forever. You must retrieve it, my son. Yes, father. You are King. You are our chance to save all that is good. To change the fate of men. To change the fate of the gods. Thor... You are my son. Loki! Loki! Loki! Come out and fight me, you coward! Now the real coward is on his back, just like Odin after I killed him. You should have heard your father beg. My father wouldn't ask a thing from you. Oh, he cried. He pleaded don't hurt me. Liar! You are the coward! Fight me like a warrior. Tell me where the Hammer of Invincibility is. Release me and fight! Your father spoke to you with his last breath. I can smell it. What did he say? He said that you're as worthless as your dogs. Let's go! Let's go! Move! Who are you? Come on! Come on! Move! Why are you helping me? Move! Find them. Kill the girl any way you like, but Thor lives for now. Go! Go! All right. Shh! I'm Thor. I know. Who are you? I'm Jarnsaxa. I'm a servant of your father. He asked me to protect you. Then let's avenge my father's death. I can't kill Loki alone, and you do not yet have the fighting skills to help. Shh! You don't know my-- [growling] Quiet! What? Come on. It's time we go. Come on. This is a battle we cannot win. We must hide. Odin! Odin! Your world is over. Mine is next. And your Tree of Life is finished. Ah, my pet. You found them. Now lead me. I'm not going to keep running from Loki like some coward. You think you're ready to fight Loki? Huh? Yes. Yes. I'm not going to fight some girl. I am a fraction of your size and I managed to best you three times. Here. Clear? Huh? Fine. There it is. Come on. The portal is open. Hurry! Make this land a chasm of death. Stop! Stop! What? What is this place? It's a training camp protected by a powerful rune stone far older than Loki. No enemy can enter uninvited. We must go to the gateway. Come on! What gateway? To the Tree of Life to get the Hammer. It can't be. This is a secret place. How could Loki have destroyed it? Destroyed what? A direct portal to Midgard. Perhaps the Norns had something to do with this. The Norns? But they're neutral in these matters. I'm not so sure. Thor! I can hear you. Why delay the inevitable? Where is he? He's outside the protective barrier of the rune stone. I don't see him. Nor he us. Odin is gone. I will possess the Hammer. We should take the fight to him. How can we fight Loki if the fates are against us? I don't believe in fate. Loki: Coward, where are you? You wanna play games? I have games of my own I can play. Come, my friends. We're trapped. Our only chance is to wait until nightfall and then we sneak out of here. A warrior God doesn't sneak around at night. A warrior uses his cunning and temperance to win a battle. And one of these... Swung with skill. I swing hard enough. Skill, even above strength. Who taught you how to fight? I taught myself... By watching my brother practice when I was small. Who taught you? The Valkyries, warrior-guardian of the gods. I was second in command under Odin's father. Hmm. Swing. Not again. Skill above strength. Swing. You have no chance against Loki unless you learn the skills I have. Then you better teach me quick, 'cause I'm going to kill Loki the first chance I get. Thor? I can hear you. Come, my friends! This is much more comfortable. [Explosion] What is that? [Rumbling] They're coming. I thought you said nothing could come in here uninvited. I think I was wrong. What? We must find the other gateway. Wait! Wait! Wait! There isn't time. Loki's probably on to us. Then I say we ambush 'em at the next bend, kill him, and be done with it. Look, even with all you've learned, we're still not a match for his powers. We have to go to Midgard. From there's we'll find a way to the Tree of Life. But the portal was destroyed. There is another entrance. Come on! Look what I let them do to my father's land. Asgard was doomed as soon as Odin died. You have a different world to save. Look! Look! New life already begins to grow. There is hope after all. Come on. The gateway is just beyond these trees. [Growling] [Growling] No, no, no. No! Thor! It didn't have to be this way. Could have died without her, Thor. You want the Hammer of Invincibility? Here. Take it! Go! Go! Yes. No! Thor? Tell me that was not the Hammer you gave to Loki. Of course I didn't. I saw it! It was always the ax. I only made him think that it was the Hammer. But I saw it. You were within range. Come on. Loki can't be far behind. My place is right up here. Give me your purse. No. I said give me your purse. [Thor clears throat] Thank you. Now you gotta pay. Give me your wallet. Thor, we don't want to be noticed like this. Come on. Let's go. This way. This way. Go! This does not seem like the dwelling of a demigoddess. It's not supposed to. The people here must think I'm human. They don't believe in the Tree of Life anymore. Here. Wear this. You'll be less conspicuous. Here. Take this. Careful. These are very powerful. It's from Midgard. How do you use it? Here. Just put your finger here. This one goes up here. Good. Be sure this is pulled. Now pull the trigger. Just think of it as the shaft of a spear, and aim your point at the center of your target. Good. Your humans certainly understand their weaponry. They're warriors... like the gods. I'm beginning to like your humans even more. We are...here. And the nearest channel to the heart of the tree is here. But we're going to have to open it ourselves. How? The tree will tell us how when the time comes. We could wait until the dark of the night. Let's do it. Hmm. Or we could leave now. To get the Hammer, we must pass through the gateway portal to the Tree of Life. Right there. Here it is. The opening has been covered up. Can you feel anything? A wall. Well, we must enter the portal now or we won't get to the Hammer in time. It will just disappear. And go back to Loki. Here. Yes. Yes. It's under this. We have to uncover it. [Speaking foreign language] Thor, I need you. I'm here. Concentrate with me. We need a strong channel through us to open it. Gateway. Gateway. Gateway! Let's go. Ready? You feel it? The presence of the essence of all life, right down to her beating heart. [Pounding] What is that? It's the heart beat. It's coming from down in there. Wait. Wait. What if it's a trap? You should stay. Why? Thor, if you die, it's over for all of us. We go together. All right. You cannot escape me, Thor. I will possess the Hammer of Invincibility. [Pounding] The heart is on the other side, and the Hammer with it. Pass through and you will be there. Aren't you coming? This part of the journey is for you alone. There is a knight who guards the Tree of Life. You must defeat him at all costs. The heart of the tree. Where is it? Where is the Hammer? Thor! Father? Thor, my son, the power of my fathers is now in you. Use the Hammer. Find it. Take this Hammer, son, the power is now yours. It's yours. Oh, great Tree of Life, thank you from my heart for all that you have given us. Give me the strength so that I might save you from destruction. How will Loki know we've returned? He'll know. We must lure him back to Asgard. I'm going to track Loki down and kill him. You're not ready to face Loki yet. Why? I have the Hammer. I have the will. What more do I need? The powers of your father. A strategy. An army. Well, I don't have an army, so I guess I'm on my own. You're not on your own, Thor. You should stay far away from me. Loki is more likely to appear when I'm alone. Do you trust me, Thor? Yes. We should go back to the war camp. The war camp? Why? To continue your training. We will need its protection so one day you can defeat Loki. One day? I have to defeat Loki now. You're not ready yet. We should go back to the war camp. Well, we don't have to go back there. I took the rune stone of protection and put it inside your dwelling place. Good. Then we'll go back to my dwelling and safely finish your training there. No training! No hiding! I kill Loki and stop Ragnerok, and that's final. I know Loki's in here. Loki! Come out and face me, Loki! Son of Odin. You're no match for me. The Hammer of Invincibility. Defend yourself, Loki. Aah! Let's go. I'm sorry. I should have hit him when I had the chance. You're brave. Rash, stubborn, but brave. Wait here. I'll check the perimeter. Jarnsaxa... You are a noble warrior. I thank you. [Rumbling] He's close. Good. This time I'll be happy to hit him in the back. No! No! You were nearly destroyed earlier. You almost lost the Hammer. Well, it won't happen again. Are you with me? Are you with me? Loki: Jarnsaxa cannot be trusted. She has kissed the demons. She is a concubine for Midgard. You must kill her. Thor? Loki: She only wants the Hammer. Kill her. Thor, do not listen to him. He's playing mind tricks. He's the devil, the serpent, the spirit of trickery and deception. Thor! Thor! We must go back to my dwelling, to the protection of the rune stone. No! We can kill him. I swear it. Thor, please! No! Thor! This is madness. He's a liar, a cheater. Do not believe what you see. Maybe the Norns were right. Maybe the Earth is doomed. I will not let that happen. I will not let the Norns control my fate... or yours. We can't kill Loki. Not two of us, not ten of us. We must hide the Hammer as Odin did. For how long? Maybe centuries. However long it takes for you to be made ready. But everything will die. No matter what Loki does to men and gods, as long as the Tree of Life remains strong all the other can be rebuilt. At nightfall, then, we return to the protection of our hiding place. You have the courage of your father and brother in you. You have my heart, Jarnsaxa. Know that. And you have mine. One day, you will be able to channel the powers of the universe, to let it fly through your arm like lightning. Thor? Oh, no. Thor! Got you. Give me the Hammer, Thor. Good. Use it. Feel the power of the Hammer. The bone of Urrl. It is useless to you. You cannot control it's power. And without it, you have no power at all. Wait! You will destroy the only thing that can bring back your father. What do you mean? Speak! Your father. Your brother. The power of the bone is the only thing that put them in Muspellheim Hell, and it's the only thing that can release them. Tell me how to use it. Tell me! Let me live, and I will show you. What of Ragnerok? I'll make it that there is no Ragnerok. No Ragnerok ever. You are the devil, full of lies and deceits. Aah! Aah! There is no Ragnerok. Aah! You are all safe. You are all safe. Give me back the bone so I can live. Aah! Give it to me. Aah! Thor! You're alive! I did it. Don't you ever-- I killed him. I killed Loki. I defeated him. He's dead. I saw him melt. And I took this from him, and he lost all of his power. Ragnerok is over. You took the devil's tool. It's cursed. You must get rid of it. But I have his power now. Even if you do, Loki's powers are rancid. They're decayed. Aren't you happy? Loki is gone. His creatures are gone. It's a trick. It is not a trick. Yes, it's a trick. That is what Loki does. He tricks. Why is everything I do on my own wrong? Why? Because you're young. And you're inexperienced. You have more courage and more heart than skills. But one day-- I'm going to bring my brother and my father back. You'll see. Those are lies. We are not mortal. We are gods, and they are trapped in the realm of Muspellheim. And there is nothing you can do about it. Their fate-- their fate is my fate. And I have changed my fate. Have I not defeated Loki? Am I dead as the Norns had foretold? Your story is not over, and when it is, one day you will discover that the Norns have sewn your tales in their tapestries from the beginning. Your father and brother are gone, and you cannot change fate. Where are we going? To my dwelling, where I should have taken you long ago. Where you will be protected. We must get rid of that wretched thing before it drives you to evil. Tree of Life, mother of life, guard these doors so that none may enter uninvited. Destroy that abomination. Use the Hammer. I will. Don't even look at it. Where are you going? To find some evidence that Loki's truly dead. And until I find that evidence, you must promise me that you will not leave the protection of these walls. I promise. Swear on your father that you will not leave. I swear it by the blood of my father. You're strong, Thor. You have a lot to learn. Crush that thing and burn it. Bring my father back to life. Bring my father Odin back to life. Father, I will reach into the halls of my ancestors and grab you. Bring Odin back to life. Loki! How did you get past the rune stone? You invited me. I killed you. You're dead. Dead? I never was alive. Join me, and I'll let your family live. My family? You mean my family, my father, who burns to Muspellheim? And your brother. Give me the hammer and I'll let them all out. Liar! Come on! Come on! I will not rest until I have it! Forgive me. Forgive me for sneaking away earlier. Are you ready, Thor, to actually take my advice? Yes, I will take it. I will listen to what you say. For my father, who burns in hell. Good. Then hear me. We'll return to Valhalla immediately. Let Loki smash away all the people and the buildings. And keep that Hammer away from Loki and I promise you, one day you will return to watch him perish in the dirt. Come, my friends. How are you, my pet? [Growling] They are near. They can't escape fate. We can make a gateway here. I'm going to need you to help me summon it. But Asgard is a heap of sand and ash. It has been destroyed. We'll find a place. I'll hide you and the Hammer. I'm not going. I'm staying here to save the Earth. Thor! Thor, please. We don't have much time. I beg you! We must keep the Hammer away from Loki. It's the only weapon that can kill the Tree of Life. So long the tree lives, there is still a chance to rebuild. Please! All right. Good. Now, hold the Hammer tight before you. Channel its powers. The will in your heart will make it open. Now, you go through it first. Jarnsaxa, do you feel I have the power in me to carry this through to the very end, even if it means I must fight? Oh, Thor, you are a God beyond my understanding, the son of the master who I've served. If you believe in your heart that you must fight, I will live or die by your side. I am your soldier. Then go through, and take this. Hide it. Protect it. Keep it safe from Loki. I am not leaving this Earth until I have saved it or death takes me. Thor? No! Take it! Hurry! Before it's too late. No! I'm not leaving without you. No! You shall die witch! Lindworms! Lindworms from underneath. Come to me! Go through the gateway! I will stop them! Go! You can't fight me, Thor. Fate is on my side. Every fabric of the universe is against you. Damn the fabric of the universe. [Laughs] [Thunder] [Speaking foreign language] Loki! It's mine! It's mine! Come on! Come on! Let's go! No, Jarnsaxa. I stay here. To my dwelling then. The rune stone will protect us. No. The gateway! The gateway to my dwelling! Gateway! No! Jarnsaxa! Now, let's see. What am I going to do to you now? Jarnsaxa. No, Jarnsaxa. Jarnsaxa, I'm here. I'm here. You'll be all right. I thought you'd never come. We've got to get you out of here. We'll get the potion of healing. We'll take care of you. Leave me here. No, I'll never leave you. I love you so much. I love you, too. Jarnsaxa? Very touching. [Sirens] Jarnsaxa... I could not change our fate. I'm sorry. Odin... Forgive me. You are not defeated yet... My King. Yes, you are my King... Ruler of Asgard who sits atop the universe... Guardian of all realms. We're in good hands... Your hands... For you are not defeated yet. Thor! I want you to witness the final moments of Midgard, when this entire planet becomes the gates to my new kingdom. It is the end of life, the end of time, and the end of you. Not quite. You cling to old dreams. You are an embarrassment. I want you to taste the bitterness of my rise to power, go back to your worms and your dogs and leave the true gods of the nine realms in peace. Soon the nine realms will no longer exist, and the time of Aesir is finished, and I will be ruler of the next kingdom, not Thor. Behold, the fire of Muspellheim. In it's fiery depths, your father waits for you... as well as others. No! No! And now I'm off to kill the Tree of Life... And unleash the final stages of Ragnerok. Aah! Close. It's time. Father? Where are you? Jarnsaxa? Where are you? I am gone... And you are ready. Nothing is beyond you. Nothing is beyond you. Nothing is beyond you. I will forge my own Hammer. Die, mother of living earth. Die. I will not be stopped! News reporter: We're getting reports of scores of unknown creatures destroying urban areas in Southern California. The U.S. military is doing their best to respond to the threat. Ragnerok. Ragnerok! Ragnerok! Ragnerok! Impossible. I sent you to hell! The power of that Hammer belongs to me. There is nothing left to fight for. It's over. Nothing is over. We control our own fate. Your heart shall beat as long as I live. How dare you come here, son of Odin. You are an abomination. Loki was meant to rule the next chapter of the universe when this one is no more. But you have killed him. Dead! Gone! Against the will of fate, so carefully woven in this loom. We have chaos in the world. Shameful chaos! What have you to say for yourself? [Screaming] This world is now controlled by those who live here, and it will be, for good or ill, what we ourselves make of it. That is true fate.
