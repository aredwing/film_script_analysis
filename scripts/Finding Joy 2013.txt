She said she took two tiny sleeping pills so she could sleep. We pumped her stomach Because you told the whole world she tried to kill herself. Wait. You said that she could be suicidal! Can't quote me on that. Anyway, she never wants to see your annoying face again. There was more about your face and some of the other parts of your anatomy. What room is she in?

I never read your goddamn book, okay? ( CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY ) You shoulda got the book on tape, like I did. More glazed carrots, anyone? What are you doing? Not gonna waste the damn meat. For the record, I read your book three times. I think mine's done, if you... maybe wanna read it. No nepotistic sugarcoating though, Okay? I wouldn't dream of it. ( CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) ( SIGHS SOFTLY ) Can't sleep? I don't sleep. Mm? Before this picture was taken, your mother had This 10-Minute hiccupping fit. Couldn't get rid of 'em. We laughed so hard. Oh, I miss her. I miss her like... like nobody's invented the word yet. ( SIGHS ) I can't leave your mother. How long? Three years... four months... sixteen days, give or take. Oh, listen, just so you know, that rap music, I hate the damn stuff. It's the only music your mother wouldn't listen to. Gloria doesn't seem to mind it, so... do you... do you love her? She loves me. Don't let that girl go. Just do whatever it takes. She... she won't... she won't talk to me. She won't... come out of her house. And I don't know what to do. Well, you'll just have to figure it out. You know, we tried everything with your mother. Everything. ( AUDIBLY STRAINING ) Joy! ( SNORING ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Oh. Kyle! Come on! Get your ass downstairs! Come on! Kyle, come on! You're gonna love it! Ha! ( MUFFLED CRIES ) Oh, my god! What... are you okay? When she came out, you were sleeping. PATSY: We panicked! What are you doing? What are you doing? We've got her tied up really nice! Yes! And I am untying her! Yeah, but she doesn't have a choice now. She has to listen to what you have to say. Yes, and that all makes sense... uh-Huh... until you bring in the whole part That it's a crime thing! Out! I'm sorry, joy. I'm sorry. Ow! All right, go, go, go. We're leaving, we're leaving. You're making a mistake. I'm not making a mistake! I'm going, I'm going! Jeez! Out! Like, go rob a bank or something! ( MUFFLED BELLOW ) I am... ohh...! Oh, god, I am sorry. Get me out of this right now. Yes, yes. Uh... ( CHUCKLES ) Y- You wrote the classiest, sassiest obit That I-I've ever read, and I don't want it To be published for a long, long time. Well, I don't have long, Kyle. Have you been paying any attention? I know you're not dying. The doctors, they can't find anything physically wrong with you. Mentally could be a whole other story at this point. You're crazy. I'm crazy? Yes, you don't know what you're talking about. Please, please, enlighten me. All right. That MRI, it didn't even show a cracked toenail. And that's a bad thing...? Yes, because if I'm not... dying of a disease, it means that I'm dying of something unexpected, But why do you think that you're dying at all? What are you guys doin'? ALL: Shh! Because he's never wrong. Who is... Who is never wrong? Who is never wrong? Who? Caesar, okay? Caesar? Caesar the cat? He's psychic. The cat? Yes. A psychic cat told you you were going to die. Yes. Every resident that Caesar pees on dies within a few weeks. Somehow, he just knows. Kyle, Caesar peed on me. Maybe he has a bladder condition, then. I'm... ( CLEARS THROAT ) sorry! Sorry! Listen! I can't... I can't believe that you believe this! Give me one reason why I shouldn't. I'm going to bed now! Forever! Joy. Joy! Joy. J- Joy! Joy! Kyle, baby. I once knew this girl who had a psychic twat. Any guy who got close, She knew if he had an std or not. I think what Gloria is trying to say Is that maybe it isn't impossible That this cat has psychic abilities. GLORIA: Exactly. You gotta prove to her she's crazy, man! I mean, no cat pee ever killed anybody! I don't think it's the pee per se, marsh. Show her you love her. Shower her with romance. GLORIA: I know some hot strip-O-Grams. Throw her a living funeral. I was planning one one for your mom, But she passed before we got to do it. No, I want the best chairs you got. What, do I sound like a cheap wad? Yeah, well, you sound like a dickwad. Uh, thanks, Gloria. I been through all of 'em. I think I'm gonna go with this one. Oh, I like it, but is it big enough? Okay, it's a short speech, Not a novel. ( SIGHS ) No nepotistic sugarcoating, right? If she doesn't love this, she's definitely deranged. Keep the engine running. ( ENGINE SHUDDERS AND DIES ) ( CAESAR MEOWS ) ( LAUGHS ) Little bugger's bladder will be so full, He'll be peeing everywhere, on everyone, with any luck. ( ENGINE HESITATES ) She'll see her theory disintegrate into thin air. ( ENGINE HESITATES ) I'll do my damndest to make sure he pees on me, man. That is one stinky puss, though. I think he's old. Just drive. Go! ( ENGINE STARTS ) Ha ha ha ha! MARSHALL: Yeah. PATSY: Yeah. You're thirsty, aren't you? Yum, yum, yum, yum. Huhp. Come on. Milk does a pussy good. Come on. Caesar, look. Come on. Here. Right here. Caesar. Come on. Come on. Wow. You're looking delightfully dapper. Yeah. Lot of good it's doing me, huh? Did you go to all this trouble for me? I'll make a deal with you: I'll go if you go. But you're not coming? Are you? Would it be easier if you weren't you? Oh, yeah, can I be brad pitt, please? Thank you. Alan. What? Trust me. Don't go anywhere. Ha! But she's not here. It's a... okay, okay, okay, okay! All right, just... ahem. Dude... she's not coming. I'll tape it for her. Come on, go ahead. Gonna rock. Gonna be awesome. Um... uh, our... Our guest of honor Seems to have been delayed. ( CLOWN SHOES SQUEAKING ) One last thing. What's that? ( SIGHS ) Right. Get into character. ( SHOES SQUEAK FAINTLY ) I can't do this. I'm sorry. Uh, I-I-I've been penning her obituary For the past couple of weeks as part of my new book, But I-It's become apparent that this... ode to my joy... has been predetermined to come to life In... In this moment. ( CLOWN SHOES SQUEAKING ) ( SQUEAK ) This is great. You're doing it. This is ridiculous! You're doing it! You're doing it, bozo! Today we mourn the passing Of our beloved joy Helena bailey, 29. She will be remembered for her generosity To the homeless, kindness to seniors and Dead birds, Overcoming her ferocious fear of clowns, And leaving her mark on the world in... truly innovative ways. She is survived by the boy-Next-Door-Gone-Wrong, Who... ( SPECTATORS TITTER ) Continue. Um... uh, the boy-Next-Door- Gone-Wrong, who... ( LAUGHS SOFTLY ) You... You make me feel the most terrifying happiness That I've ever known. And I don't want it to end yet. Kyle... I thought this celebration was your way of saying That you understand and you accept. Yes. You adying. So is everyone here. I could die tomorrow, before you, But... you are not going to die Because a cat peed on you. MAN: Yes, she is! No, sir, she's not! Yes, she is! ( CAT MEOWS ) Finally drag my ass outside, and this is what happens. Outstanding. Alan, I-I am so sorry. He's... He's fine. He's just a... A cat. This is asinine! You're the asinine. Joy. Marshall. Will you stop filming? ( TELEPHONE RINGS ) WOMAN: Please leave a message For the Alexis agency at the beep. ( BEEP ) KYLE: Hi. Uh... I wanted to let you know that the book is, um... not done. ( HUMORLESS CHUCKLE ) Sorry. I, um... I just couldn't finish it. This story was never meant to be, I guess. But I am going to send you something else, By this promising young author I know. It's, uh... well, I think you're gonna love it. ( LAUGHING SOFTLY ) It's invigorating, this thing called fresh air. Wanna join us? Uh, rain check? All right... ( PATSY SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ) Ooh! ( LAUGHING ) Don't spit it out. What's the point of the game if you're gonna spit it out? ( MARSHALL CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY ) Hey! ( GASPING AND GROANING ) Are you sure this is what he wanted? Not... Not in nature or on the water? Couldn't we just put him up on the little shelf upstairs, Like mom? He said, and I quote, "When I die, I want you to shake my ashes where you shook my world." He was talking about this floor. I mean, we did it a... A trillion times, Right here. Those were good times. Oh, hush. Al, baby, Enjoy heaven. Just not too much.
