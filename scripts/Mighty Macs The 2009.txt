Thousands of women rallied in Times Square this afternoon to demand equal pay for equal jobs. Feminist leaders took to the podium to voice, we should be training to be a doctor, not training to mary a doctor. l wish l could say that life was always this simple. But, for me that really came down to mo choices. Could l deal with rejection and temporay pain, or, or should l sumer a life filled with regret because l was afraid to take the risk? At the time l only knew a few things about the college. lt was all girls, their basketball team wasn't vey good. And, the school was founded and run by the Nuns. l had no coaching experience, so l was somewhat surprised when they responded to my resume. But, on the sumace, it seemed like the pemect opportunih for a woman who wasn't ready to assume her role in socieh. Hi, l'm May-Margaret O'Malley, and welcome to Immaculata College. How may l help you? Ah, Mother St. John's office? Room mo menh, take the staircase to the second floor... ...lt's menh eight steps... Proceed through mo walnut oak doors. And all even rooms on your left. Thank you. No, thank you. Oh, Rally for O'Malley. Catherine Rush? Yes. Thank you. Are you named after St. Catherine of Sienna, or st. Catherine of Alexandria? ls there ah... St. Catherine of Atlantic Cih? Well, if there is, l hope she didn't sumer the same fate as St. Catherine of Alexandria. She was beheaded. Ah, here's my ah... lt's all right, l have one here. l see you're married? Yes, just a few months now. Physical Educational degree Westchester State College. Did you play there? Two years. What do you know about coaching? Well, l know for the first time, it'll be five on five, full court with unlimited dribbling, so it's obviously not our Mother's game. lt will be similar to the men's game. Yes, similar to the men's rules, but the, the game will be dimerent. How so? Oh, we'll actually play like a team. And ah, ah, thim second shot clock means better conditioned athletes. Are you suggesting that our girls will become athletes? lf they want to win, yes. l'll be satisfied if you just use these activities to suppress their hormones. Huh, l'll ty to add that to the playbook. Well... seeing that no one else has applied for the position, l'm prepared to offer you four hundred and fim dollars for the season. That'll be just fine. Do l get an assistant? No, only if they volunteer. Ah, this is our last ball. Please ah, don't lose it. Thank you. Can l ah, have a key to the gym? Oh, you won't need one. Great. The gym burned down three months ago. Here's the student's schedule. Now, if you'll excuse me, l must attend to the needs of our Sisters. Practice is scheduled to begin in three days. Ah, where? l don't know, you're the coach. Mrs. Rush... l hope you're a better coach than you are a negotiator. Why is that? l was prepared to offer five hundred. That's okay, cause l was willing to coach for free. Congratulations. Are you mad? Why would l be mad? You got that same look when l beat you in tennis. When do you start? Tomorrow. Like l said Cathy, why would l be mad? Come on Eddy, it's just a little something to keep me busy. Just like ah... tennis was a little something to ah... what, keep in shape? l know how bad you wanted to go on this vacation, honey, and l do... lt's not about that, Cathy, we both agreed to... Will you... will you just hear me out? l, l want to have a family with you... more than anything in the whole world. But, if l don't ty this just once, l'll always wonder, what if, you know? You know how much l wanted this. Right? Let not yours be the output the dawning with radiant... decoration of gold, and wearing... but let it be the hidden person of the heart. Thank you. And since you are the joint heirs of the grace of life, finally, all of you... have unih of spirits... Pass that to her. That girl over there. ...the sympathy, Iove of the brethren, a tender heart and a humble mind, do not return evil for evil, or reviling for reviling. For on the contray, bless, bless... Yeah, right there. Right ...for this you have been called, that you may obtain a blessing. This is the word of the Lord. Amen. Bonjour. Hey, l thought you were home shopping for engagement rings? Nah, he wants to wait till graduation. He gave me his letter jacket, as a pre-engagement ring. Ah, vey nice Lizanne. We're going out for team, right? Why, so we can continue to get crushed by all the bigger schools? Look, they didn't recruit me either. You need to let it go. You know what, l think l'm ready to get a job. Yeah. Right. Trishy. ln a week, you'll be looking for an open gym. You in? We're in, right? Yeah, l'll think about it. We're also requesting, once again, that the heating system be replaced in the Freshman dormitoy. So, where do l find these numbers? Page five. What about the alumni support? They're not banging the buckets like they used to. Yes? Ah, Mother Superior, it's Cathy Rush. l'm in a meeting. l, l'll just wait out here. Oh, excuse me. What is it? lt's bitterly cold outside, Reverend Mother and l can't find an indoor court. Excuse me. Sory. The old activih center. Oh, thank you so much, and all of you, of course. Thank you for this opportunih, l... Please. Please. l wonder if you'd all excuse me for a minute, l, l'd like a private word with Monsignor. Ah, you can't depend on the trustees for continued financial support. Now the board will be meeting in three months... so, consider yourself warned. Mother of God. Don't take this personally. This is... the business side of our church. But Tom, why can't we use the insurance money from the gym? Unfortunately, it will take an act of God to save this school. Well, that's exactly what l've been praying for. Come in. Yes? Reverend Mother may l speak with yo'u? Sit down. How may l be of assistance, Sister? l'm not sure l can do this anymore. Admissions is always dimicult, especially in these changing times. That's not what l meant. l'm sory, but, l'm requesting some time off. l'm not surprised. Did you ever struggle with your calling? lf we didn't have to struggle, we could never harvest the gloy. l'm sory Mother Superior, l thought my service would be dimerent. l'll be glad to reassign you to Chapel, that should give you plenh of time to ask for guidance. Trish Sharkey. Here. Lizanne Caufield. lcei, it's French for here. Merci, it's French for be a team player. Ah, what is it? l think l'm allergic to dust. You will make a wondemul husband. Gail Moore. Here. Colleen McCann. Here. Was that a here, Miss McCann? Yes. Short, tall, fast or slow, it's our voice that makes us one. Understood? Yes. Jen Galidino. Here. Who here likes to win? That is the only reason you should be here. Unless, of course, you're tying to avoid household chores. lf that's the case, we've already got mo things in common. Jen, you know why teams win? Talent? lf basketball were only about talent, it would be played one on one. You like these girls, Jen? Yeah, l guess. Okay. Who here thinks that Jen's lipstick is a good color for her? Come on, anybody? Look at her. Cute girl, olive skin, beautiful smile... and street corner lipstick. Colleen, care to comment? Trust. Trust is why teams win. And, if you can't trust your teammate, to tell you your lipstick is wrong, you can't trust your teammate's call at a back door screen. So, l will ask again... who here thinks it's a bad color? Easy to fix. Watch each other's backs. That's all l'm saying. Who here knows how to mim? Great, the wooden pool is open. lf you want it, fight for it. And, if you're afraid to get your hair wet, you can always wear one of these. This is so unladylike. You should quit, too. Next. My dear Lord almighh. Running projections, analyzing numbers, and finding applications. l failed to find the spiritual nourishment required to enter my fifth year, and take my final vows. So, l implore your divine guidance, to have mercy on me in this dimicult time, and l ask that you send me ah... ...l implore your divine... to send me a sign, any sign as l will be listening for your voice. Bring it in, good job, give yourselves a hand. l want each of you to take one of these. Here you go, and pass them around. Hold the top mo corners bemeen your index finger and your thumb. Uh huh. Now, l want you to close your eyes. Close your eyes, good. Now, l want you to envision evemhing you know about the game of basketball. Defense, screens, jumpshots, Iayouts, keep thinking. Evemhing you have ever done on a basketball court... rebounds, bounce pass... think some more. Now, l want you to take all that knowledge and mentally transfer that knowledge onto these delicate pieces of paper. Make sure you leave nothing behind. And take that paper, hold it close to your heart... embrace that knowledge, you can open your eyes. Excellent. Place them gently in the basket. There you go, Gail. Now, what we must do is take evemhing you know and... get rid of it. l'll see you here tomorrow at seven am. What? Get used to it, and then again, four pm. That's mice? Bright and early. Good night, girls. Two times? Where did you play? West Catholic. lt's a nice pass. Ma, where are Frankie's boots? By the front door. They're wet. Just need some plastic bags. Oh, thanks Ma. And, tell Frankie l'll need a ride home. Will do. Got to go. Love yah. Love you, too. Before evey practice, l'd wait outside that gym and hope that five girls would be willing to race a new world. We started with fifteen girls who had fifteen dimerent stories, and it didn't take long to hear them. Jen was our fun-loving Nurse in training. She was looking for an excuse to get out of the house. Lizanne, a solid role player who could be a star if she wasn't so busy planning her engagement. And, Trish, a big time player who got overlooked, so all she could think about was where she wasn't and what she didn't have. And so, we began. Plaid sashes, huh? So, l heard you were the all time Ieading scorer at Oakcrest High. God, yeah l was. Too bad l never liked pom-poms. l don't get it. Senior year they dropped Girls Varsih Basketball. They asked us to be Cheerleaders instead. That's not right. That's what l thought, too. Thanks for the new rim. We are here to serve. l can't wear this. Swing your partners round and round. lt's not that bad. That's because you're already married. Who are these inspected by, Adam and Eve? For now. This is all we have, so buck up. All right. Stretch it out, come on. You're still here. Bend your knees. The first thing you'll learn, how to defend. lf you can defend, it shows me you care, and if you care, we can play as one. Now, get low. Hands out, palms up. Slide left. Lower. Don't cheat me, don't cheat yourself. Come on back this way. Okay good. Keep going. There you go. Good job, Trish. First thing evey young girl should learn, proper way to clean a floor. So, ladies. Make it shine. Slide, slide. Left. For the next six months, you need to break up with your ego, if you can't do that, there are plenh of playground courts out there that'll accommodate you. Anyone else want to quit, now would be a good time. Right, slide, slide. Good Trish. Slide. Representing this school is a privilege. Mimi, down. We will learn to defend it. She already has a husband, why would she want to work? We know who she's married to, right? Ed Rush, the NBA rep. Word is, he had to give Mother Superior a case of hand lotion, just to close the deal. Wouldn't surprise me, around here that stum is like gold. Frankincense and Mer. That's because it's the only gift they're still allowed to keep. ls that true? Am l crazy or does the cook's shoes clash with her belt today. The woman has got a lot of shoes. l liked it better when her uniform smelled like mothballs and cigarettes. Yeah. Catch. Pivot. And Pass. Catch, pivot and pass. Be careful, it's hot. Let's go. Press break. No, no, the other end. Come on, come on. Hustle up. Move it. Move it. Move it. Good. Yes. Ball movement and teamwork that's how we break the press. All right, let's run it again, come on. Good, good, good. That's what l'm talking about. Did you see that? Yeah. Well, that's exactly why they're in first place. Cathy, you... mind if l get some work done here? No, no, of course not. See, they never let anyone get an easy basket. Cathy. Great. Ah. So, who here still needs a ride to the game? Does ah, anyone have a car? Any parents going? Really? Friends, family... Nope. Anybody know anyone who can drive? l can drive four. Ah, great, well ah, l can handle the rest. Can l help you? Yeah, l'm here for Trish. He's my brother. Okay, you can stay. Thanks, Ralph. All right, get some rest, big day tomorrow. Ah listen, you need to hury the band practice is in an hour. Girl's locker room? Right through there, door marked, ''Ladies Room''. Oh and ah, the walls are out of bounds. Thank you. Come on in. All right Rosemay, come on. You okay, coach? Sure. We'll get through this. l want each of you to pin this on to your uniform. Right. As you think, so shall you be. All right. Listen up. Sory. All right. Let's go. Come on... kick the ball out, kick the ball out. Trish. Did you forget your bathing cap, Mimi? Did you forget there were five of us? Good afternoon, Sister. Good afternoon, Coach. Heavenly Father. l seek your help in this time of need. There are times... when we need the strength to survive things on our own. And then, there are times when we need your help and the help of others. And, l ask for your help in finding me an assistant coach. Of course, she'll have to help me find a gym to play our home game. Hah. And it'll be really great if she had a car. Okay, now you're pushing it. Well. Oh, come on, you just need a driver. Look, we can do this. Now it's a we? l know l can't do it alone. Amen. Was than Amen, or l'm in? Both. Move the ball. Get back, get back. Little safer at the end of the bench. What can l do for you Trish? l got a job in a department store and they need me there three days a week. Well, we're going to miss you. Can l do both? Oh, not in our program. ls that job something you've always dreamed of? No, not really. But employees do get fim percent discount. l can only tell you this, have the courage to follow your dreams. That's your gift to the world. Maybe it's working in a department store, l don't know. But, if you give that gift, l promise, a day will come when the world returns the favor. l thought dreams were only for rich kids? No, dreams are for eveybody, all you need is the heart. You have the gift to play this game, Trish Sharkey. There is no doubt in my mind, but you have to believe it. You let me know what you decide, all right? So, what a million dollars? Wouldn't it be better just to borrow against the equih? That would barely be enough to pay for the upkeep. But, where would my Sisters go? We will have more than enough to insure they enjoy a comfortable life. But, what about the students? There are plenh of colleges in this area. l might have a tough time explaining this to my wife and her former classmates. But, if you could secure a written offer with those hpes of numbers, we'd be foolish not to sell. l move that we improve the research of these activities and ask that we reconvene in nineh days. l, l think we'd be playing better ifwe just had a few more things, so l put a list together. Here we go. Ah, you may not be able to read my handwriting... ah, new uniforms, ah warm ups and, and, and team sneakers. Oh yes, well, l'd be happy to be of assistance. Yeah? Sure, just follow me. Let's see what we have. This is my room, you can help yourself to anything l have. And then Mimi crashes the boards hard. Where you going? Frankie, you have friends? Aqm. Friends who play basketball? ls there another kind? Ohh, l hope this works. Rosemay... if Frankie is cutting through the lane, you need to keep contact with him. lf he's going to be aggressive, how should you play? Same way. Right on, but with a pony tail. Let's go, ball in. Sounds good. Good stum. lt's okay to pass the ball, Frankie. Thank you. Flash to the ball Good, good, good. Yes. Blow the whistle. Hey, Colleen, you need to get bemeen him and the basket. How many times did Coach go over this. See your man, and the ball... okay. Know where he is at all times. Find him and box up. Stay with him, just like this, don't let him get the rebound. Okay? Good job. Mrs. Rush, may l have a word with you, please? There are no men allowed on this campus, let alone having physical contact with our girls. Now, send these boys home. l've got my eye on you mo. All right boys, ah, that'll do for today. Reverend Mother wasn't always this stressed. When she first got here, we'd stay up all night playing Poker. Of course, that's when they used to give us walking around money. She'd look at her cards, Iay them down, straighten out here cash and say... be not afraid. Then she'd bet evemhing. Boy, was she good. Oh, she took a few bucks from me. And that activih room used to be packed, l'd have to wait thim minutes to get on the bike. Those were the days. People had a little respect for the habit. Now look at us, in a few years, we're going to be an exhibit at the Smithsonian. We need to stick together. First mitch, oh, somebody better help me out here. Oh, bless you. Maybe you could use some of your rec time and come out and cheer on the basketball team. Watch the pick and roll. Hold. Time out. You got to get there sooner. l tried. -Move your feet... -you can't just stand there after you get beat. lf you call for help and she helps you, then you need to help her. Help the helper, that is the way it works. Does eveybody understand that? Just play the team, all right. Bring it in. One, mo, three, team. Team! Help, help, help. Help your man. Protect the basket, come on, move your feet. You call that, defense? l need to find out who wants to be here. Shake hands and get in the van. Come on, girls. Let's Go. It's okay. What is she doing? l don't know. Watch your step, ladies. Come on, pick it up. Bring it in. Colleen. Come on, come on. All right, take your jackets off. Jackets off. Let's go, defensive slide drills. Here? Defensive slide drills. Who's first? Mimi. You're up. Palms up, back side down. Up and back. Go, go, go. Trish, Colleen, Gail, Rosemay, come on, come on. lf you want to stay dy, you need to lift your feet. Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster. l don't like this. Cathy, that's enough. Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go. Again, here we go, one more time. Get through. Trish, get in there. Lizanne, come on. Gail, Rosemay, come on, come on. Our results will not change until our habits change. Too dangerous. Come on, come on. Come on. Here we go, here we go. Get back in now, go, go, go. Lower, lower, lower, lower, faster. Keep your feet dy. Are we in it together? Cathy, stop. Here we go, you're not done. Going back. How much are you willing to sacrifice, huh, how much? Come on, move, move, move. There you go, there you go. There you go. Keep it going. Cathy, that's enough. Here we go, one more time, back in. Keep your feet dy. Here we go, come on, come on, come on. Cathy, stop. These girls were sent here for an education. ln what, historic preservation? l'll see you in the morning. Hey. What? Maybe this isn't working out the way we planned, huh? Well, you're going to have to adjust. Huh, l'm going to have to adjust? To what? To never seeing each other, to ah... never having dinner together, to ah, ah, watching game films together. You know, maybe l don't want to adjust, huh. lt's not my fault you're ah, spinning your wheels on something that no one cares about, Cathy. l, l care. What, you'd rather l just sit at home all day while you travel allover the county? Yes, you know, l travel so l can pay for this apartment and evemhing else that's here. What they pay you, that's not even legal. All right, most women, they would be grateful. Grateful? Hey, in the past three years, do you know what l've done with my free time. l go to your games. l find the time to support you. So, l'm thinking you don't understand what grateful is. Ah, l didn't know you were so unhappy. l am not unhappy. Well, you don't sound too happy right now. l'm frustrated, it's dimerent. Because you're tying too hard to change these girls, Cathy, and they don't want it. lt's not that they don't want it, it's that they have been told so long that they can't have it, that, that they can't even imagine wanting it. You know, l can't even talk to you. Seven am, and ah... They're not here. It's okay. Maybe l pushed them too far. Maybe Ed is right, and they're not like me, and they don't want what l want. Mrs. Rush, your entire team broke cumew last night. We've never had that before, nor have we had anyone endanger the lives of the girls. l... Now, that is unacceptable. You leave me no choice. lt was my idea. l should have known. So, you finish out the season, and then that's it. Don't be surprised if all the others quit, too. You didn't have to do that. l know. But, we can't give up. l don't know if you've noticed, but... we have no team. Rosemay, you're going to force the ball in the sidelines. Now, l need you to keep your feet dy. You got that? Trish, Trish, you're going to sneak in and double team. Don't reach, no don't reach because, Gail, l want to anticipate this pass across court, you got that? Here we go. Yeah.... one, mo, three, team! One, mo, three, team! Go, yeah. Get in there. Go girls. Right, right, right. Go, go. Nice. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. That's what l'm talking about. What? Nothing. May l help you ladies? Coldest thing on tap. Okay. -l'll ah, have the same. -Okay. Oh and ah, melve number mos to go. You got it. And put those drinks on my tab. Oh no, you, you don't have to do that. It's fine. Thank you. Just passing through? Aren't we all. l like a woman with a sense of humor but l bet a prem gal such as yourself must be hitched? You could say that. What's the old man do? He's ah... carpenter. He's good with his hands, is he? Works miracles. And you? Ah... my husband's also vey good with his hands, thanks for asking. The good ones are always taken. Ah, do you ladies like to dance? Thank you, but we'll have to pass. Ah, girls night out. l can respect that. You ladies have a nice evening. You, too. You are trouble. Takes one to know one. Nice win. Who's in? l am. Ah, Math. Who do you pray to when you need help balancing your checkbook? Ah, l just pray to my Dad. My Dad would kill me if he knew l was going to college. What? Daddy, l'm thinking about becoming a Nun, and would love to volunteer at Immaculata. He don't know? No. Now he thinks l'm the team Nurse. Does Coach know? Yeah. She said we'd wait for a quiet moment to let him know. So, when did you... know? l'd been with this ad agency for... four years, finally got my first big promotion, and l felt, nothing. l woke up the next day, and, thought. There has to be more to life than this? So you just... Ieft? Well, the first thing l did was break up with my boyfriend. You had a boyfriend? l was menh-six and living in Manhattan. So. do, do you ever miss it? Sometimes. But, my whole life l had listened to others tell me what l should do. And this time, l listened to that little voice inside of me. Uh. So, l quit my job and took a bus to Immaculata. Why there? l had this great, Immaculate Heart of May Nun, in high school. She whispered something to me that l'll never forget. Jesus likes to dance. That's how l reacted too. lt forever changed the way l look at things. Like, the whole wedding an canna thing, apparently he was having a good time and wanted to stay. Oh, it sounds just like Ed. l mean, not that Ed is like you. He really loves to dance. Have you told him lately?? Told him what? How much you love him. Yeah, sure. l mean, not exactly. Ah, a little hectic lately. Umh. That's why l'm asking. Since when did you become so perceptive? l'm just saying... keep your eye on the ball, Coach. So, you think you'll stay? lf it's meant to be. One, mo, three, team! That's it, come on. Let's go. Come on, Trish. Come on, come on. Here we go. Alright. There you go! Run it out, run it out. Let's go, Rosemay. That's her. Who? My old coach. Great game. Great game. Looks like l might have been wrong about you. Well, thank you. Next time, you play the Varsih. What was that about? l started Freshman and Sophmore year, after that she cut me, mice. Why? Said l wasn't a team player. Hello. Hey, it's me. Hey. Where are you, l thought you'd be home by now? Yeah, the train got delayed and l'm stuck in Newark. What? Yeah, l know. Hey, how was your game? We won. That's great. How did you do l did all right. lt was close, but l, l did all right. Oh, we're leaving now, so ah, l'll see you in a few hours. Okay, travel safely, all right. hey Cathy... l love you. l love you, too. Hey, honey. Yeah? Thanks for asking about my game. You're welcome. Where did you guys meet? At a basketball campus. Did you know right away that he was the one? l did. How did he propose? What makes you think he proposed? Really? No, but l thought about it. Was it fun shopping for a dress? Well, my Mother made it. Did you have a good wedding? No, we eloped and then ah, came back and had a pam. That's so meet. l can't wait for my wedding day. Nine, ten... Good afternoon, girls. Hi Coach. Seven, eight, nine, ten. Where's Lizanne? No one's seen her all day. Well, was she in class? No, Coach, she wasn't. Again. That's nineh dollars and fim cents. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a great day. l got it. Thanks for the jackets, have a nice day. Oh, hello, Coach. Thanks for coming. She still in bed? Yes. Come in. Hey, Coach. We missed you today. l'm sory. Give us a few minutes. She's a mass. You okay? Yeah. Breaking up is the worst. l know there is nothing l can say right now to make you feel better, but... l just loved him so much. Hey. What are some of the things he's going to miss about you? Right now? Nothing. Not true. What makes you such a special person? l know the anmer but l want you to tell me. l'm bilingual. Okay. And l think l'm a prem good dancer. You know, for a Catholic girl. Go on. And l... and l think l'm prem, probably not right now. You are. All of those things, even right now. And, what you think of yourself is way more important than what he thinks of you. This isn't you. Don't let his jacket define who you are. This is who you are. Ty it on. Might be easier if you stand up. You've earned this jacket, and nobody can take it away from you. Right? The team's waiting for you. Coach. Thank you. l've already phoned our Sisters in Baltimore. Good. Now let's go talk to Mother Superior, huh? Come on. It'll be all right. Trust me. The ah, retiring Nuns will move together and live at the Mother House. Excuse us... but we have some vey exciting news to share. We're in a meeting here. l understand, but we got invited to the Regional Championships. Huh. Well, that's vey nice, Mrs. Rush, but now is not the time. What year are you in, young lady? Oh, ah, l'm not a student, Mr. McHail. And, l know it's Mr. McHail, cause l go to your bank. l, l cash my checks there. My own paycheck. We coach the basketball team, we got invited to the Regionals in Baltimore. We just needed some more money to get the kids there. Mrs. Rush, l'm afraid at this time, we have more important issues to deal with. There has to be something we can do? Please except my apologies for this interruption. Would you please excuse us? We can't give up, we've worked too hard. You must leave now. Do you understand the commitment these girls have made? Young lady, l don't believe you understand the meaning of the word, commitment. lf it means not giving up when no one else believes in you, and, and, and, if it means showing up evey daywhen all hope seems gone. Then l do know what it means. But, l didn't really understand that until l got here. l know you're tying to save this place, but the only way to protect these girls and to protect your future is to make them stronger. And, we do that by working together. There will always be other people who think they have a better plan, but at some point, we have to stand up for what we believe in. My goals are no dimerent than yours. Good afternoon. We will have three offers before the end of the day. Who put this here? Who's button is this? Well, we're not going to eat until someone steps forward. lt must be yours. We can't really call it a rematch then. No, ah, but ifwe win, we'll get one of the melve automatic bids for the nationals. lfwe lose, we meat it out with the rest of the county. Four large bids. His wife was Immaculata. No kidding.

Thanks. lmmaculata is clinging on to a one point lead at the final minute of play. Don't give up the base line. ...that the heavily favorite, Mississippi State dribble the ball, side to side. The fans are on their feet. And that's mostly to defend the ball. Dribble private a pass shot is up and good, and a foul. Oh no. Mississippi State takes the lead. There's the foul shot, it's up and good. lmmaculata now trails by mo. And the Macs push the ball up the court. On three, on three. Okay. Looking, looking for the open shot.

No good, and we're headed to overtime, but wait, wait The Referees confer. What's wrong, Coach. Before the end of regulation, foul to one. The Macs have one more chance. Number 12, you pick the court. Trish Sharkey's going to go to the line for mo. Going to make that Ionely walk out to the free throw line. There's a lot of pressure on a young girl. And she misses. Time out, time out. Come on. Have a seat, have a seat. l'm fine, l'm fine. Here's some water. Listen to me, you can do this, Trish. Just trust your shot, bend your knees. And, don't forget to breathe. All right? Good. All right, let's go. Here we go again, Sharkey walks the plank. She's now four for nine from the Charih stripe. She dribbles. Shoots. lt's good. Yes. Yes. Finally, Immaculata College is going to the finals. One more. Light another candle, Sister Regina, this dream is still alive. What if they full court press? We go upside down, oven mitts on, center and forward bring the ball up, Trish and Rosemay are speed to go to the basket. What if they don't press? We put the winter clothes on. l don't know that one. lt means, it'll be a cold day in hell, she'll never adjust. l think we're ready. Guess we're about to find out. No matter what happens tomorrow, l want to thank you for what you've done for me this year. You are a team player, you have helped the helpers. No. You don't need to... No, no, no, no. You listen to me, Cathy Rush. You taught me, that not only is change possible, it's as vital as breathing. And, not only that, you also taught me and all my Sisters that sometimes Angels wear high heels. This is the corniest thing l have ever heard. Do you not know that in a race, all the runners compete. But only one receives the prize. So, run that you may obtain it. Corithians. You've earned the right to run tonight. And it's okay to want the prize. Lizanne, do you know why teams get to the championship? Trust. Yeah, that's why they get to the championship. Do you know why they win the championship? Anyone? l want all of you to point to yourselves. That's right. Look where you're all pointing. This. This is why, this is where championships are won. One team, one beat. This is what keeps us alive, but we can't even see it. It's not about what we wear or where we live, or how much money we have. That's how they see us. That's how they judge us. None of that matters. Because, what they don't know is that we will win tonight. And we will win because of the things they cannot see. One minute. Coach. Eveyone. Take a knee. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First National Championship for Women's college basketball. Tonight, it's histoy in the making, as the Golden Rams of West Chester State College face the Macs of Immaculata College. The tension is building here inside the arena as the Immaculata faithful rise to their feet. And the Mighh Macs are taking the floor. This is one of the most improbably championship match ups in sports histoy. The pint size Papal institution received one of the four large bids and was seated in number fifteen out of sixteen teams. lt was just one week ago that these mo teams played for an automatic bid to the Nationals, and Immaculata lost by fom-mo points. How will this faimale end? Will the glass slipper fit head Coach Cathy Rush and her little sisters of the floor? The anmer lies somewhere bemeen Heaven and the hardwood. You got to go. Westchester State usually ins the championship. lt's pushing forward. That's an easy layup ...setting up the defense. Macs are fighting to get open. Get it to her... And a... they're tying to get it in, passed the ball to... and the Golden Rams steal it. To the net... to the net. The net. Macs stay in bounds, quick passed the middle. Vey nice. ...move the ball up the floor. Here's another pass and they score. Yes, that's teamwork. Here we go. Yes. Yes, yes. lmmaculata pressuring the ball. The Macs are all over the floor... coasted free. And the floor, picking up loose ball, bounce by layup, score. They're putting the ball around. Moore pass the ball down to Trish Sharkey... Yes, yes, there we go. Macs tie it up. Westchester wastes no time getting down the floor. They shoot. And a foul. Are you kidding me? Come on! Head Coach Rush doesn't like that. Westchester dribble, mings it, Macs rotate to help, there's Moore with a steal. Passes the head, Macs look to push over half court. Exhibit... rainbow. And a pot of gold. The Macs tie it again. Westchester controls. Slide your feet... Yes, stay right there. Open jumper, she nails it. Westchester leads by mo in a minute and a half left to go on the game. Find Rosemay, Gail. Find her. Search. Jump shot. We're tied again. There we go. That's it. Macs with the ball, a chance to lead, time's running down. Sharkey, a jump shot, and it drops through. Macs take the lead by mo. Thim five seconds to count. Westchester in ah... foul line, jumper. Good. We are tied. Sixteen seconds. Fourteen. Thirteen. Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in. Time out, Cathy Rush. Jen, you're in. Okay, listen up. We'll start fourteen low. Rosemay, l want you to hand off to Gail. Trish, l want you to flash to the ball. They're going to be overplaying with Jen. l want you to set a back door screen. All right. You need to trust that Trish will be there. Let's do this. Be strong, Trishy. -All right, on three. -Ready? One, mo, three, charge. Come on, let's go. Here we go, for evey team that thought they never had a chance. Twelve seconds. Ten. lmmaculata sets up along the baseline. And now they motion. Five seconds. Sharkey lays it up. lt's good. Yes, yes. lmmaculata College has won the National Championship. The Mighh Macs are number one. Nice game. We did it, we did it. Congratulations, Coach. When l look back, l'm not sure any of us could explain the mystey of how we won, or why we won. But maybe, all we did was look around us to see other women committed to something they believed in. Somewhere along the way you forget how important that is. As a team, we must have learned from that, because in the end, it proved to all of us that anything can happen when we're committed to our dreams. lmmaculata College survived the turmoil of the early seventies. ln 2005, it went co-ed and is now thriving as Immaculata Universih.
