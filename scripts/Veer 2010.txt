But they could not stop them from becoming a legend. "The wind carries the messages." "The wind carries the messages." "Don"t write your messages on the leaves."

Are you from London Times? - Yes, London Times. Ram Singh, you"ve been with king Prithvi Singh for a long time. - Yes. Tell me something. At a time when the entire country is following Gandhi... Everyone talks about non-violence... ...but Your Highness Prithvi Singh... ...is preaching violence. Why? And why does he hate us so much? Why doesn"t he have faith in the British Empire? Faith. Faith leads to betrayal. "Year 1862, when Chandangarh attacked Madhavgarh." Hail the prince. We can"t wait any longer. Chandangarh"s army is overpowering our army. Order the reserve troops to march forward. It"s not necessary that wars are always won with might. They"ll be here soon. You"re putting the lives of your troops at stake for those Pindaris They must be drunk with their local brew... ...and must be wading in a pile of muck. Though you know that Pindaris... ...are men of their word, you still do not believe that they... These inebriated Pindaris might be... ...loudmouths and uncivilised. But once they are astride their horses wielding their swords... Now, the reserve force will be useful to us. Chief. The crown prince has invited you for a drink to celebrate the victory. The chief of Pindaris Hyder Ali... ...only drinks with the kings. Prithvi. - Yes, Chief. Go. Magan, Chaman. - Yes, Chief. Naunihal. - Yes, Chief. - Bhairav. - Yes. All of you go along with him. And get our lands back from him. - Come on Victory be to Guru"s Khalsa. Chief... - Calm down. It needs to be dealt with calmly. Didn"t Hyder Ali come along? Prince, even your father king Sangram Singh... ...wouldn"t address Pindari chief Hyder Ali by just his name. Save your attitude for the enemies. At the moment, I want to conquer the entire province. Of course. But we made a pact only for this battle. And, in return, you ...return us our lands. - I surely will. But first, let me introduce you to my friends. Your father said that the British... ...are in favour of Chandangarh. Prithvi. Prithvi. Prithvi. This is politics, and it"s beyond your knowledge. You just enjoy the English liquor. Bring it forth. We drink only the blood of these British. What era are you living in, Prithvi? We should only befriend the rulers of half the world ...and not take up enmities. Prince... - Naunihal! Are you done? Return us our lands, and get lost from here. Land? Where do you want your lands? There? Do you want it there? There? There? Or below the stairs of our palace? Where you"ll always get to witness my progress... ...even after you"re dead. And as far as your companions are concerned... Take a look. Treachery. Prithvi, we"ll deal with them later. We need to save our Pindari brothers first. Let"s get down there. Quickly. Fire. Kill them. Prithvi, get out of here. Be quick. But Chief... - Go. Don"t think. Go. We"ve been deceived. Don"t let them escape. Hail Lord Shiva. Come on. It is our mistake. We trusted the wrong man. The king. L"m the only one entitled to be punished. That"s why l"ve decided... - What"ve you decided, Chief? Haven"t we lost enough men... ...that we should lose another one? We"ll leave our homes. Burn down our fields. We"ll spread in different directions... ...as rebellious farmers and warriors. And then we won"tjust get our lands back ...but drive the king and the British out... ...and conquer Madhavgarh. We won"t drive them out! We"ll behead them. Because we"ll avenge the death of 4500 Pindaris... ...by massacring that rogue king... ...and each of his British friends. Then I give you my word. L"ll behead the king and each of his British friends. Or die myself in the effort. "The wind carries the messages." "The wind carries the messages." "Don"t write your messages on the leaves."

Congratulations, Chief. - Congratulations, Chief. Chief, it"s raining. The child will get drenched. Where are you going? He has to keep going. He has to keep going. He has to travel a great distance. He"s my Veer. Rain or storm holds no meaning for him. Veer. Veer. My Veer. Get up, Veer. Father, watch my move now. Oh, God. - Pick him up! Oh, he"s picked me up. Come on, Veer. Father, one day, l"ll throw you in the water as well. Bravo. Veer, learn to control your anger. The future expects a lot from you. Look out, Veer. Pindaris are coming. Prepare to fire. Princess. The Pindaris are here to loot the train. Let"s go. The dacoits are here. Put in some more coal. Bravo, Veer. Go, Veer. Lousy Pindari. Whichever part I get hold off, I rip off five kilos of flesh. Tell me... treasure... India. From here to London. There is no treasure. Veer, there"s a royal coach here as well. No, there isn"t anyone here. There"s no treasure here. This is the ladies coach. There"s no one here. L"ve heard that the Pindaris... ...always protect women and children. There"s only the princess here. I swear on Lord Ram. Let"s go. Listen. Take this jewellery. But please return that toy. That"s her mother"s last memorabilia. Veer is back. Veer is back. Veer and Punya are back. Everyone is back. Look. Mother. Punya! Mother. - Come on. Your Punya has robbed an entire train. Are you telling the truth? - Yes. I did it all. Go tell father that he can go ahead, and... ...buy as many weapons as he wants to attack Madhavgarh. Where is Veer? Father. Where"s father? If I get hold of you, I will pin you down today. Go ahead. Why are you two fighting again? Why did you get them educated if this is what you wanted them to do? Yes, I did get him educated. And I wanted to get him educated further. Stop it. He nudged me. He nudged me. Father, someday, l"ll surely throw you in this water. L"ll be waiting for that day.

Only cowards use their force on the weak. My father"s sword is meant only to behead the British. Only to behead the British. Only to behead the British. "Fire." It took four years. - Veer. But your father"s long persuasion finally bore fruit. Now, you both are going to London. Right, left. Gentlemen. - Bravo. Father. Veer. The land of fair women, London. You go, I don"t want to go. I want to look for her. We don"t know anything about her. Where will you look for her? Father is coming. Think of some excuse. Don"t you want to go to London? What? - London. Of course, I want to. Father. You talk about beheading those British... ...and now you"re sending us to their country. Their strength is their devious mind. There should be someone amongst us... ...who knows how they plot ruses. You"re going to London, that"s it. Oh, God. Bless London. Veer. London is such a beautiful place. Look. Queen Victoria"s palace is so beautiful. The tombs in our country are better than that. Haven"t you seen the Taj Mahal? Be careful. - Watch where you"re going? - Sorry, sir. Veer, why are you walking so rigidly? Now that we"re here... ...why don"t you adjust yourself? Lt"s just a matter of two years. Two years? Anything can happen in two moments. What if she gets married within these two years? I wonder what"s wrong with father. He sent us here to learn the tactics of these British. He should"ve sent us to Madhavgarh. Within six months, I would"ve talked sense into everyone. Veer. Stop, Veer! How dare you? Excuse me. I apologise on his behalf. L"m sorry. Please take this. Veer. Veer. Get up. I can see that lady that displays on her face..." When will I ever get over her? Come on, Brother. Let"s go back to India. You don"t get handkerchiefs in dreams. Look. She smiled. Come on. Hey, Charioteer, stop there! Veer! Catch it! Veer, slowly. L"ll fall! Veer! What are you doing? - Veer! Excuse me. Veer! Veer. My ice-cream. My ice-cream. My ice-cream. - Don"t scream, madam.

London is absolutely stunning, Veer. Everyone knows English here. The same as everyone knows Hindi in India. Stand properly. Attention. Quiet. All right, sit. Do you know what is good about London? There"s no dirt even on the streets. Not a single one of deserves to be here. But thanks to Lord Macaulay... ...and his new education policy. And the kindness of Her Majesty, the queen... ...you are here. They think that barbaric and uncivilised natives like you... ...can be transformed. I don"t agree. But now is your chance to prove me wrong. Now, these tribal clothes, the tribal haircuts... ...won"t work here. I don"t want the British and royal students... ...to feel uncomfortable, because of you. So, everything has been arranged on the campus... ...to make you men. Sir, clothes don"t make a man. Man makes clothes. Something like that... Something like that was quoted... ...by your Lord Bernard Shaw. Don"t you get smart with me, son. You people call yourself men. L"ve seen how you live. L"ve seen your India. How you people live, the way your country is. Sweat. Smell. Dirt. Filth. Muck. Flies, lousy pigs, cows... everywhere. Dirt. Dirt. Dirt. Hey, Teacher. Punya, hold on to this. If our country is so dirty... filled with dirt, filth and muck... ...cows, buffaloes, flies, smell and sweat... ...then what"ve you been doing for the past 140 years? Cleaning up? My father sent me here to study. Only to study. Otherwise, I would"ve taught you today. Rogues, you betray your own benefactor. Don"t talk about my motherland. Don"t talk about my country. Four sticks. The punishment will commence... ...and will not cease until four sticks are broken. Your hands on the table please. Great, Mr. Gajendra. What a shot! You"re a good player as well, Sujan Singh. So, what were you saying, Yashodhara? Brother, l"ve found out... ...that the boy wasn"t at fault at all. The management was unfair to him. We should talk to them. Yasho, why are you like this? Just because a barbarian returned to you a piece of your brooch... ...you feel these barbarians have a heart. You"re right, Gajendra Singh. You absolutely right. It"s the generosity of the British... ...that they just publicly caned him and let him go. Had it been Ratangarh... No, no. Expelling him is not the right thing to do here. We"re not running a school, we"re running a country. But, my lord. I smell of revolution in all of them. We"ve come here today... ...to request you to call off this new education policy. My dear principal, we entice these barbaric fools here... ...to educate them. Mislead them into our way of thinking and our culture. Get them indebted by doing small favours. Enslave them, rule them and rule their country forever. This is the beginning of a new England in India. In fact, my friends, it"s the end of India. These British are absolutely right. Our country is filled But what"s the reason behind it? The reason is that all the kings aren"t united. Whose fault is it? Ours or the British? Initially, only 187 British came to our country. Then 2000. Then 10000. And then 100,000. And these 100,000 British... ...ruled over 300 million Indians. "Do you know how?" "Father, because they only know how to divide us." "Under the pretext of hunger, greed, language." "And we know only how to form different sects." "In the name of religion, caste, kingdom and the king." "And you know, Father..." "...there"s a ruse behind their education policy as well." "They want to corrupt our minds with British culture. To know their thinking, and their cunningness better... ...we brothers have slightly adapted ourselves like them. Bless me. Veer. - Yes. Don"t forget to write to father... ...that you"ve fallen in love with London. - Fine. I will. "Lt"s got to be... got to be the world." "Lt"s got to be... got to be the world." Veer, this is a royal party. You"ve bright chances of meeting her here. Don"t be scared. L"m with you, okay. Where are you going? Remember what father said. To understand these British... ...it"s important for me to understand the British ladies. Attention. Hello, girls. - Hello. How are you doing? - Good, how are you? That"s funny... - Yasho. What? - Look. Excuse me. Excuse me. Assume that she gets trapped if she smiles. - What"s he doing? Excuse me. Excuse me. Yes. I want to talk to Yashodhara, and not you. Don"t you have any manners or shame? Just because you travelled to a foreign land... ...you forgot the difference. God knows what these British saw in them... ...that they let them come to the royal club. We know what these British saw in us. But you were born to rule. So, what did you see in these British... ...that you let them enslave you? Hey, come here. Yes, My Lord. Slaves? Take a look. This is how they stand before us. Brother. - He was calling us a slave. Brother? - He was justjoking... Brother, don"t get so angry. It was only a trivial joke. Joke? - Yes. Allow me to crack a trivial joke as well. Of course. - Come. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Veer, love isn"t your cup of tea. Forget it. Why do you want to get yourself killed? Careful. You"ve been lying on this bed for the past ten days. You still have three months to go. Your love story has come to an end. What? Give me the shoes. - Shoes? You couldn"t even wear your socks. You think you can wear the shoes. Here, wear them. Wear it. - Chest. Chest. - What? Place it on the chest. - On the chest. Here. Here. Shall I push harder? Shall I push harder? Sorry... What are you saying? I don"t understand English and you are talking in some other language. Where is she? Did you see her hat? - What hat? Yes, I think I did. It was quite weird. Mr. Veer Pratap. Yashodhara. Carefully. - Yes Excuse me. Have you started studying... How is your leg now? - It"s better now. So, have you forgiven my brother? - No. Actually, you tend to get hurt in games. It"s not his fault. Thank you. Thank you? What for? L"m grateful to you. Take care of your leg. - Of course. Listen. Look after yourself. - Yes. You will, won"t you? - Yes And now, a folk dance from Czechoslovakia. Lady. Lady, that can wait for a while. Please. Let us entertain ourselves. For now... Veer will perform for India. Sorry folks. And now, Veer will perform for India. Only Veer can perform for India. Gajendra Singh, thank you very much for this favour once again. Do you want to double the entertainment? - Yes. Then I want an Indian partner to dance with me. Yes. Yes. Come on. - Yes. Yashodhara, I believe you sing and dance very well. Would you be kind enough to join my brother on stage? How can I? - Yes, yes. - No. Hold on. Hold on. She cannot dance like a commoner. After all, she"s a royal. And we royals have a protocol. L"m sorry. We all understand protocols. But music doesn"t understand any protocol. So, everyone hold on to their hearts. Otherwise, my voice might stir up your hearts. And royalty is compelled to dance with commoners. So, shall we begin? - Yes. Team xRG "Your cheeks blush in many different ways."

And my leg will be injured more seriously. But I can clear your misconception. With your permission. Sorry. Your Highness, I hope you had a pleasant trip. Would you excuse me? My love. Long time. Anything special. L"ll talk to you about it later. What about the Pindaris? They plunder in one state and escape to another. It"s very difficult to catch them. I think we"ll need to get all the six kings together. Greetings, king. Unite and fight them back. My sons are working on the plan. And soon... Father, I want you to meet someone special. He"s here. Ask him to take a seat. - Yes. Like I was saying, my son... He"s there. What are you doing? All the guests here are rich. And I knew that you won"t dance with me here in front of everyone. That"s right. We can"t break the Protocol. And I can"t get my legs broken everyday as well. If breaking can unite someone... ...then is it really called breaking? So, why does your father want to see me? Because he"s the king? Which is his kingdom? Shikarpur? - No. He"s the king of... Madhavgarh. He"s here to see the queen. This time around, he"ll make all arrangements to annihilate the Pindaris. You know, Veer, they"re barbaric. Once, they looted the train I was travelling in. Did they harm you? - No. They severed father"s hand. Thank God, his head wasn"t severed. I heard that he deceitfully... ...led thousands of Pindaris to their death. That"s wrong. We just want to make them civilised. By throwing them out of their houses. The Pindaris have only one motive. Independence. How can you say that? Princess of Madhavgarh. Your mother"s last memorabilia. Veer. You have to leave, Veer. Brother has found out who you really are. He"s gone to the hostel to look for you. Punya. Pindari. How dare you? Tried to mingle with the likes of us. And with my sister... Idiot. It"s rightly said, sons have to fulfill their father"s incomplete deeds. Where is your brother? Thankfully, he isn"t here. Whichever part I get hold of... ...l"ll rip off five kilos of flesh. Veer. Veer. Let him go. Let him go. Forgive him, Veer. - No. He"s Yashodhara"s brother. We don"t have any enmity with him, but his father. We do! We do! We do! We do! We do! We do! We do! Brother, no! No, no. Go away from here. Go, Veer. Go from here. Promise me, Veer. You won"t ever come to Madhavgarh. I promise... That I will come to Madhavgarh. With father"s permission... I will marry you amidst the fire or... ...I will torch Madhavgarh. We"ll meet again.

Crown princess Yashodhara. - Glory to her. Crown princess Yashodhara. - Glory to her. Crown princess Yashodhara. - Glory to her. The prince... The way you supported me in front of Britain"s queen after the prince"s demise... You fulfilled your duty by saving... ...the 700-year-old Mihir clan from extinction. L"m proud of you. But some of our guest kings and political agent Steve have a question. The pledge that you"ve taken to annihilate the enemies... ...how will you fulfill it? Whereas... l"ve decided to arrange for your Swayamvar to answer these questions. And the first offerings in your marriage will be made with Veer"s blood. Veer murdered that cripple"s sons. What are you going to do? Don"t tell father anything else. Otherwise, he"ll behead you. Father. Imported. Didn"t you get me any foreign women? Father. - Yes. Love, Father. Love. - What? Just like you love your wife. - Yes. Similarly, your Veer has fallen in love with someone. Can you say that in sobriety? I can show you. Did you hear that? My son is in love. My Veer is in love. Mangla, you"re safe now. You"re safe now, Mangla. What"s wrong with you? Father. - Yes. Won"t you ask her name? Is it necessary? - Yes, Father, it is. Say it. Dhara. - Dhara. Yashodhara. - Oh, Yashodhara. Princess. Madhavgarh"s. What a son! What a father! Hey, Mangla. Hey, Mangla. Come here. Come here. She was my enemy"s daughter as well. Her father didn"t agree, so, I abducted her. We"ve received chief Hyder Ali"s message. All the arrangements will be done by the next full moon. More than 15,000 Pindaris will set out for Madhavgarh. On that day, Prithvi will do two things. First, he"ll behead all the British along with the king and conquer Madhavgarh. And, second, he"ll bring daughter-in-law home. Father, when you set out to get mother... ...did you take your army along? - No. Then how could you even think... ...that your Veer will take an army along? Now, answer that. Then give him the bracelets. Team xRG "Every time I look into your eyes, I see my paradise." "The stars are shining bright up in the sky, painting words of desire." "Oh, charming eyes."

Ms. Anjala. - No, Angela. Good name. - Thank you. Good. - Thank you. But this jungle is no good. No birds, no deer. There. Sorry. - There. Tiger. Do something. Madam, we can"t do anything. Now, the tiger will do whatever needs to be done. Run. Run, madam. Someone help. Help, somebody. Help. Leave me. Leave me, Veer. Do you want to kill me? I got trapped in my own ploy.

So, we can pay back for all you"ve done for us. L"m very grateful. With Lord Rama"s grace, everything goes right. And anyway, anyone else would"ve done the same thing. You"re too modest.

Thank God, you"re fine. - Don"t worry, l"m okay. Thank you. Poonam. No, Poonam Singh. This is my cousin. William. - William. Hillary William. Pleasure meeting you. So, what time? - Wrong time. L"ve recently been appointed as the political agent... ...of the kingdom of Madhavgarh. Is Madhavgarh expecting a war? No. Preparing for a hunt. - Hunt? Yes, we"ve decided to root out these barbaric Pindaris... ...once and for all. Barbaric Pindaris. - Yes. We"ve combed through the entire jungle, Your Highness. All our commanders from the ally kingdoms... ...have decided to set up camp near the river. Narsingh, we should use the camps as quagmires. It should pose as a shield for us, and a death-trap for them. Angela, what a brave girl! How are you feeling now, my love? Thank you, sir. L"m fine. L"m so lucky, Prince. You"ve done a brave deed. Doing such brave deeds is a common thing for me. Where do you hail from, Prince Mahendra Pratap Singh? Rusai Valley. Rusai Valley? Lt"s a 14 day journey towards the Kailash confluence. The mountain dacoits have terrorised our valley. They steal our ready crops, and flee into the snow regions. Just like the Pindaris kill your people and flee into the desert. And to kill them, we need light-weighted and long-distance cannons. We were going to Vijay regarding that matter. This time, we"ve thought that... ...we"ll enter their snowy region and turn it into their grave. Pleased to meet you. L"m equally happy to meet you. Me too. - I apologise, Your Highness. That"s okay. Whenever someone extends his hand it reminds me of the moment... ...when he deceitfully severed my hand. And then I think about the moment... ...when l"ll behead him, and it makes me happy. I never forget my enemies. I too never forget my enemies. Whichever part I get hold of I rip off five kilos of flesh. I don"t even leave that much. Wow. L"ve learnt a new thing today. I promise, I won"t leave a strand of hair of my enemy"s body. Oh, Princess, I was so scared... Accidentally, your father"s hand came off. But you know, the king is such a sport... He handled the situation so well that everyone was relaxed. Not only that, he declared the saviour of Angela his state guest. Such a brave person he is. What is it called in Hindi? Veer (Brave). A real Veer. Kind and cultured. But fearless. I love this music. The rehearsal has begun for the song. Come. Come, Princess. You must perform too. Come quickly. Veer. "I heard a faint whisper." "Call out my name." Team xRG "I heard a faint whisper." "Call out my name." "The eyes lowered and rose up again." "And she slowly greeted me." "I heard a faint whisper." "Call out my name." "The eyes lowered and rose up again." "And she slowly greeted me." "Every time he spoke..." "God spoke through her eyes." "Every time he spoke..." "God spoke through her eyes." "Always stay close to me." "Convey everything through your eyes." "I felt relieved to see you." "I heard a faint whisper." "Call out my name." "The eyes lowered and rose up again." "And she slowly greeted me." "L"ve to keep moving ahead..." "...with the burning "Without you, l"m destined to yearn all night long." "With or without you..." "...these beautiful moments seem to have frozen in time." "Lt"s difficult to endure." "I even breathe without you." "The heart beats even in your absence." "I just remembered." "I heard a faint whisper." "Call out my name." Team xRG "Come into my life like the dawn." "Fade away like the dusk." "L"ve laid out my dreams in your path." "Be careful not to step on them." "Slowly, unknowingly, you deserted my thoughts." "But I can"t stop thinking about you." "The moon waits for you." "The dew waits for you." "I just remembered that." "I heard a faint whisper."

"He flirts with me at the banks of the river." "He doesn"t listen to me." "My beloved is very naughty." Wow. Hillary, did you learn all this for me? So, what time? - After marriage. Two days ago, I sent a message to the prince. He didn"t come see me. He was out with Angela on that day. Oh. Where is he right now? Good. Nice. You are learning it soon and playing it in tune. That means you are learning quickly, and learning the tune. Hello. Hello, Princess. Can I steal the prince from you for a moment, Angela? Okay. - But ma"am... What do you think? L"m seeing whatever you"re showing me? Stop it, Veer. When Angela finds out the truth... What is the truth? Why don"t you understand my helplessness? You"ve fulfilled your promise, Please leave now. Princess, how can I leave? Your father has invited me. For your Swayamvar. If you don"t leave Madhavgarh by sunset tomorrow... ...l"ll do exactly what a princess should"ve done. "The wind carries the messages." "The wind carries the messages." "Don"t write your messages on the leaves." "Don"t write your messages on the leaves." So, Veer hasn"t left. "Dear Father, l"ve committed a crime." "In the flow of my emotions..." "...I staggered in fulfilling my duty." "Prince Mahendra Pratap Singh is Veer." "Yours Yashodhara." "The wind carries the messages." "The wind carries the messages." - Give it to the king. "Don"t write your messages on the leaves." "Don"t write your messages on the leaves." "When these messages reach foreign land..." "...they"ll cause only grief." "Someone stop it." "Someone stop the sun from setting." "Somebody save us." "My life is full of darkness." "Somebody please diminish it." "All the doors are closed." "No one gives me any solution." "My legs have been chained." The letter... This isn"t a letter, it"s the army details. Thank God. We"ve worked out a new war strategy to annihilate the Pindaris. And we"re most grateful for the Prince"s valuable suggestion. Prince? - Yes. Yes. When he can to go after the dacoits in winter... ...then why can"t we go into the desert after the Pindaris in summer? That"s the reason l"ve combined my army... ...with the armies of my ally, and directed them towards the desert. You know, in the summer you can"t see anything in the desert beyond 10-12 feet. The desert storm can diminish our army. The same goes for the Pindaris as well. They can"t avert the desert storm as well. This is the right time. To find their whereabouts... ...and annihilate the armed and unarmed Pindaris. You didn"t give the letter, did you? Why do you understand my heart so well? Why? The one who should, he... It"ll cause a great catastrophe. Give the letter to the king. But Veer took that letter... What? "Respected, Father. L"ve committed a crime." "Prince Mahendra Pratap Singh is Veer." "I didn"t tell you the truth because my feelings for him..." Should I say it in front of everyone? A Pindari"s hand is made of steel. You"ll grow tired, Princess. You formed a watch on my hand. Good times are about to begin for me. What"s the truth, and what"s not? What should I understand? What should I do? Father has sent bracelets for his daughter-in-law. Tell me something, Veer. If you"ve to choose between your father and me then who will you choose? The truth. If father is right, then every son follows him. But what if the father is wrong? Should the child leave him then? He shouldn"t leave, nor support him. Instead, bring him on the right track. Which path is right? They shouldn"t carry out their royal duties. Or let the lineage passed down on them... ...through our ancestors be extinct? Deceitfully killing 4500 Pindaris. Is that called doing your duty? Enslaving Madhavgarh to the British. Is that called carrying forward the lineage? Princess. Your kingdom isn"t in danger from the Pindaris... ...but from your own father. If your father had kept his promise... ...this would"ve never happened. The pledge that you"ve taken... ...for the welfare of your kingdom... l"ll support you in that. I promise, your army will not be harmed. The Pindaris won"t attack, as long as you don"t attack them. Now, l"ll adorn you with these bracelets... ...when you muster the courage to speak the truth. You"ll address me Veer in front of the entire world. We"ll meet again. "It has left the sky." "How can I call you Veer?" "The king is after your..." "The first ritual in your marriage..." "...will be carried out with Veer"s blood." "Krishna..." "Krishna. Krishna..." "Krishna..." Veer. We had decided to meet in winter. Why did you call us in this blazing summer? We hadn"t finished preparing yet. Father, those British had united eight kings. But we diverted their armies towards the jungle. What a son I have! - Stop, Veer! Veer! - Father! Veer, careful! Come on! Father! - My son! Come on. - Father. Today, if I catch you, l"ll not spare you! Come on. Father! Veer! - You! Prithvi. You"re so fortunate. Chief. Bravo. When these two are by my side... ...I can win the entire world, and notjust Madhavgarh. Forget that, Prithvi. Ask Veer, did he win over the princess or not? Naunihal, why do you ask him? Ask me. All you need is strength in your arms. Women and horses are one and the same. Look here. Pick her up like this. The first drink is in the name of those Pindaris... ...who aren"t amongst us anymore. Veer. You mean to say, we don"t have to fight the battle. Keep our swords inside the scabbard. Wait in this summer. Naunihal, let"s see what Veer has to say. Chief, have we lost our minds... ...to listen to this young boy? Gajdhar, if we had to decide with our swords... ...then we wouldn"t have lost our brothers 25 years ago. Veer has returned from England... ...with a new sight and vision. Your son Veer will be the chief in this battle. What prejudice! you trusted Prithvi... ...and sent him to see the king. And 4500 Pindaris were killed deceitfully. And today, you"re going to make another mistake... ...by trusting his son. Naunihal. Just because this boy... ...received education in a foreign country... He"ll order us around. He has only received education in England. But he isn"t a foreigner"s son. He is not a British man"s son, but yours. But your son has learnt to flee like them cowardly. Uncle. Let me know what"s been going on in your mind for so many years. What do you mean by what I am thinking? We would"ve been betrayed... ...if I had gone to take our lands back. I would"ve strangled the king right there. And you fled from there, coward. You dare abuse my father. - I will kill you. Wherever l"ll get a hold, I rip off five kilos of flesh. You dare challenge me. You dare challenge Gajdhar. L"ll bury you right here. Start digging, we"ll see who buries alive who. Don"t go back on your words if you"re Prithvi Singh"s son. Now, we"ll decide with life and death. So be it. Shut up, Gajdhar. He"s a fool. Why are we Pindaris fighting amongst ourselves? Prithvi... An arrow shot from the bow... ...and words once spoken, can never be taken back. This battle will be fought. And whoever survives... ...will be the chief of You cannot die so easily. You abused my father. Get up! Get up! Get up! Get it weighed. It will be five kilos. Everyone, shift camps behind the hills of Madhavgarh. - Yes. Father, we"ll meet next after I win your daughter-in-law"s hand. Veer, be victorious. Veer, be victorious. Its a very special day for Madhavgarh today. By organising the age-old tradition of Swayamvar... ...the king has done a favour on all of Madhavgarh. I would like to thank the kings, the guests competing princes and the residents of Madhavgarh. ...for their presence, on behalf of the king. He"s the pride of the Rajputs. The descendant of Mihir clan. L"m very sure that Pindari will surely come here. Just give me a sign... ...and watch how I avenge the death of your brothers. Okay. - Hail the king of Madhavgarh. Hail princess Yashodhara. Hail the crown princess. Hail the king of Madhavgarh. Princess, l"m looking for the prince as well. He still hasn"t arrived from Vijaynagar. Hail the king of Madhavgarh. Hail the crown princess. Oh, I forgot. This is my fiance John. - Hello. Hello. John also has a passion for folk music. That is why l"ve been learning it from the prince. And now, it"s time to welcome our chief guest... ...the great governor general Fraser... ...who in the year 1872, along with king Gyanendra... ...slew 4500 Pindari revolutionaries. Now, we would like to request Mr. Fraser... ...to say a few words. Hello. Hello. Hello, everybody. L"m honoured to be present in this Swayamvar ceremony. And for this purpose, we"ve got a warrior. And that"s why, to make this competition interesting... ...we"ve brought a warrior along. With the king"s permission, it has been decided... ...that any prince who defeats this warrior... ...will win the princess"s hand in marriage. And here comes the giant warrior Rhino. The great warrior Rhino. Who will fight with me? Come down, and fight. Is there nobody who can fight with me? Are there any real men here? I need to see how hot-blooded the royal blood is. How dare he say that? Say it, as I said it. Is there a man among you? I want to see the rage in a Rajput"s blood. What happened? Has your rage died down? Is that all the rage that"s in royal blood? The royal blood"s filled with so much rage... ...that a single drop is enough to burn your fair skin. Glory to... - Prince Mahendra Pratap Singh. Glory to... - Prince Mahendra Pratap Singh. Veer! Yes, l"m Veer! The son of Prithvi Singh! A Pindari! Veer! Veer! "Solitude. Solitude." L"ll cut you into so many pieces, that... Yasho. Dear, l"ve cradled you for hours with this one hand. L"ve tucked you in bed with this one hand, and... That"s why I always followed my father. But for a crown princess... ...Veer"s way is the righteous one. Yashodhara is Prithvi Singh"s daughter-in-law... ...and Veer"s wife. If anyone tries to harm him... ...then Veer will wreak havoc... ...that"ll be worse than earthquakes and storms. Calm down, King. The Pindaris have taken over Madhavgarh. And we"ve learnt treachery from you. We came to Madhavgarh for making the preparations. Half of your army has advanced towards the jungle. We"ve sabotaged almost all of your canons. And look, we"ve closed all the secret passages for your escape. Are you listening to this sound? Listen closely, King. The Pindaris have surrounded the fort from all sides. Now, you won"t be safe behind these walls for long. Sooner or later, you"ll have to open your doors... ...for water and supplies. If you don"t do that, the hungry and thirsty people... ...will slay you along with the British. We"ll see who beheads whom? - Your Highness. Mr. Veer, you must know... ...that we British are not afraid of massacre. In your holy book, the Bhagwat Gita... ...your Lord Krishna has said, "War should be the final option." So, Mr. Veer, you can take Madhavgarh... ...and give us a safe passage. I didn"t appoint you the chief for this battle... ...so that you can think in the favour of those British. L"m not thinking in the favour of the British. L"m thinking about the entire country, Uncle. Veer. Why are you suddenly concerned about the country? This is our battle. This is our country as well. After going to England, l"ve understood one thing. There"s no point in massacring a few British. We"ll have to drive them out of the entire country. Let"s drive them out then. Let"s drive them out of the entire country. Once we kill a few thousands... ...the rest will flee on their own. Notjust the British. The kings that attended the Swayamvar... ...the soldiers of Madhavgarh, and a few hundred Pindaris... ...aren"t the only one"s who"ll lose their lives. But the innocent and helpless... ...residents who live in the palace will die too. And if we can attain Madhavgarh without battle... ...then why shed blood? What should we do? Like you say, should we lead that king, that officer Frazer... ...and the British soldiers to the border? Those British have thought of a wonderful plan to escape. We want blood, and not Madhavgarh. They blew up our comrades, have you forgotten that? "Fire." What do you feel? Even if we let them go... ...they won"t come back again? They won"t attack us again? And won"t people die then? They"ll deceive us, and attack us as well. People will die. But at that time, those deaths won"t be for revenge, ...but for a motive. It"ll be for the country. Just think, if we let them go today... ...and they come back. We"ll have our entire force... ...but we"ll also have the army of Madhavgarh. And the people here. And all the kings here... ...will realise how the British enslaved them with deceit. Then there won"t be any deaths... but martyrdom. And it"ll spread through the entire country. Today, we have the opportunity. Someone will have to take this step. How can we lose this opportunity... ...bestowed upon us by fate? "Because we"ll avenge the death of 4500 Pindaris..." "...by massacring that rogue king..." "...and each of his British friends." "Then, I give me my word." "L"ll behead the king and each of his British friends." "Or die myself in the effort." Veer. A Pindari can never go back on his word. When it concerns the country... Can you still not go back on your word? Then why didn"t grandsire Bheeshma... ...break his promise in the Mahabharata (Hindu epic)? Fine, it will be decided tomorrow morning... ...between Prithvi and Veer. Listen, the people of Pindari dynasty don"t cry. Veer. Can"t this be averted? I want to live. As your wife. I want to spend my entire life with you. Today, we"ll live every moment like a lifetime. "You were peeking from the edges." "From behind the moon." "You were peeking from the edges." "From behind the moon." "I searched the entire world." "But didn"t look in the eyes." "You were right in front of me." "Let"s soar away." "Beyond the restrictions of time." "Beyond the restrictions of time." "Let"s soar away." "Try to understand what my eyes try to convey." We"ll meet again. Father, your son isn"t that great a warrior... ...to tread on this righteous path. You"re on the right path, Veer. Pick up the sword. Don"t give the world an opportunity to say... ...that you aren"t my son. Fulfill your promise. And let me fulfill the promise given to the Pindaris. "What is the greatest thing for a Pindari? - Courage." "And greater than courage? - Promise." "And greater than a promise? - Father." "And greater than a father? - Father." "No." "The country is greater than your father." "The country is greater than father." Whoever survives will do his duty. Father. Veer. - Father! No! Veer. Greetings, Father. Father, l"ll never let your name be tarnished... ...as the murderer of your own son. I won"t let you live with the burden... ...of people calling you the murderer of your father either. Little more. Little more. Hold it. The Pindari brigade, they"re out of range. I know how to get them in the range. Father. Treachery! Veer! King, this is a crime. This is the brink of slavery. Father. - Veer. Veer. Veer. Veer. Veer. Veer. You were fighting to save these treacherous people? You were fighting with us for them? No. I was fighting for that. Look. He"s fighting for us, Your Highness. The British aren"t our kin. We"ll have to drive them out of the entire country. This is wrong. We British will be blamed for this betrayal. Shut up. - He promised us a safe passage. Commander. A Rajput never goes back on his word. We should wake up and see the truth as well. Hail Mother India. Hail Mother India. Hail Mother India. Just take me there. Shoot them. Come on, kill them all. Open it. Get them. Go, go. You"ve an avarice for land, don"t you? Tell me. Where do you want it? I won"t give you any land. Because every time a king like you... ...was handed this land, the country was enslaved. Father, one day, India will have only one flag. Punya. Father... your daughter-in-law. Father, tell mother we"ll meet again. And don"t you go anywhere. L"ll come back again. Veer"s sacrifice gave a new direction to the revolution. Many of the kings took part in the freedom struggle. And now, my Veer"s son... ...is carrying forward this freedom struggle. Veer. So, Veer has come as his son. A Pindari had given his word. He had to come. My junior Veer. How are you? - Grandma. You"ve grown old. - L"m still better than your mother. Where is grandpa? Grandpa. Grandpa. If I get hold of you this time around... ...l"ll pin you down. - Go ahead. Go ahead. Carefully. A Pindari"s eyes are filled with rage. Come on. Come on. Pick him up. Pick him up. Pick him up. Didn"t I say, someday, l"ll surely throw you in the water. For years, I was waiting for this. Grandpa, Pindaris never shed tears. I know. But let me cry today. Let me cry today. Let me cry today. "Put your hands together, Veer, and clap your hands." Click away. Click it. "Put your hands together, Veer, and clap your hands." "She"ll adorn herself with bindi, henna and colour." "Such attitude, that "She stares at the mirror and says, "I look beautiful." "She stares, she stares, she stares." "She stares at the mirror and says, "I look beautiful." "Put your hands together, Veer, and clap your hands." "She"ll adorn herself with bindi, henna and colour."
