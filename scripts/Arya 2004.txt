Every living being searches for love Every living being waits for love It has no reason for it's birth. No one knows when and how it starts. It's a journey to eternity. Where's Geethanjali? I'm searching you... I'm waiting for you... To see you once, I'm ready to die a million deaths. I wish may you get the girl you are waiting for. ...from a girl Wow! This is golden sunrise! I'm ready to die for that girl. You both back off, first I'll give my life for her. First me! - No, me first! This is not a joke. I'm serious now. If you really love her, no need to die for her. Get her anklets. Again same dream? Same Kanyakumari incident? Forget it. Don't get tensed thinking about it again and again. You're feeling unnecessarily for a man who died for an anklet. Did you ask him to die? Life with you is very difficult. Any little incident you take it to your heart. Watching T.V. till late night, come on get up. You heard, didn't you? Get up quickly & get ready. Coming... I'm going. Don't think too much and get confused, okay? Geetha, come quickly. First class is by Veerappan. He's not a teacher, but a dinosaur. Who's that girl? Name is Geetha. Very strict girl. Every member in our gang has tried her. She didn't fall for anyone. Mother promise. You too will fail. You may also fail.... Brother...dash. Have books fallen down? Yes brother! - Are they collecting each other's books? You are right brother! - Are they saying sorry to each other? You are right again, brother! They are going away. No, they'll turn back to see each other after few steps...watch. You're right again! How could you guess it? I've seen plenty of such foolish love stories. He dashed against her today. Tomorrow, he'll beat anyone passing comments on her. After that, he'll ask her to come to a restaurant And then a day after that he'll threaten to die.- Why? To force her to say, I love you. That girl will say it in a confusion over his threat. Another love story begins... ...it's once again same routine... I'm bored seeing such boring repetitive love stories. You are correct. Brother...- Why there's an audio break? Get up and see it yourself, brother. Why did she gave a disgusting look? This is also routine... Who are you little girl? You look gorgeous. You cool down boy. He didn't know she was your friend. Forgive him brother. I'll take care of him. You wait man. Why are you getting tensed up? Do you know who he is? He's M.P. Avataram's son. His word is a rule in this college. If it is broken, people disappear. Shut up. Why did you beat him? Why are you bothered if he passes comments on me? Look, I know why you are doing all this? Don't play such cheap tricks on me. You dashed against me yesterday. Today, you beat him for passing comments on me. You'll invite me to a restaurant today evening. You are coming to Coffee Day today evening. Why didn't you come yesterday? I'm asking you. Why should I come? I love you. If you don't say I love you in 24 hours, I'll jump down from the college rooftop. Will he jump down really? I don't know. He is a mad guy. He may jump. I know him very well. Already you are feeling for a man who died for your anklet. If this man too jumps down to his death, you can't live peacefully. Listen to me. It's just words... tell him, I love you. Let's take other things later. Do you want me to say? - Yes. Is this all love? Isn't there anything else? It'll be good if some one picks up. Uncle, please help us. Pull him up. Hail boisterous youth! Hail singing and jet speed youth! Let anything happen, let's do what we like to do. Even bitter will taste good if you get used to it. Whether it's right or wrong. Let's do it. Let's take the first step. Experience will make one wiser. If happiness is with you the world is with you. Let's sing... for enthusiasm! Let's live... ...for love! Drive away darkness and defeat with a smile. Hail the patience! Celebrations must hit like a typhoon and flood our lives. Hail the vigor! Let's run...till we succeed! There's no going back after sighting the target. Your word must break silence and stop a war! Hail the mastery! Turn your foe into a friend with your love. Hail the victory! Let's become one sharing the love. You are a king if you've a loving heart. You are going to join a new college. Be careful. Call us on phone if you face any problem. No...no...come down! ...come down. Our man is living his role. Tell him. Tell him, I love you. Tell him...he may jump. - Come on tell him. Say it quickly... - Say, I love you. Say it loudly. I've found some one. I've found a girl. A chocolate and three stones A friend I don't know. What's your name? Where shall we meet again? I got it. This time also I'm sure to win the track events. It seems you are going to Delhi. - Yes. Sorry, I'm getting late to the practical class. Or else I would've come to see you off at airport. What? I'm leaving to airport in 10 minutes. Come to the airport with luggage. A party so early? Useless fellow! What? Do you know him? That too he's saying in front of me. Stop man...I'll kill you. Dares to say he loves you in front of me... Tell me, who is he? - Boys...come here. What happened? That guy just said 'l love you' to Geetha & left. I want his details. We'll find out. Get going, you're getting late to your flight. I want immediately. You leave now. - I'll take care...you go. Go... Who is he? New Student? How dare he says I love you to... This flower has been blessed by the touch of my lover's hand. Anyone of these 3 stones falling into that cup... ...my love will be a success. ...or else...no! Oh no! This game is cancelled. Let's play it again. Did he express his love in Ajay's presence? Yes, do you know how tensed I was? May be he doesn't know about you. - No, he did it purposely. Why don't you introduce him to me? I'm getting bored with life without a boy friend. How does he look? Is he handsome? What handsome? If I see him again... I'm fine. Playing fun with me? The man with me yesterday was Ajay... I know. You love him and I love you. Are you doing this knowing everything? If you love some one, should I stop loving you? How can it be love if I give up so easily? Isn't it? Why should you love me? What's that question? Love is life. A foolish man threatened to jump and you said I love you. What other thing do I need to fall in love with you? What do you want from me? You don't need to love me. Just feel my love. That's it. I hate extroverts like you. Why hasn't he come yet? Success! My love is a grand success. Take chocolates Do you know what did Geetha say to me? Did she say, I love you? What? Yes, Geetha said, 'l hate you'. True. Distributing chocolates for saying, I hate you? Boy, tell him. Do you know the meaning of 'l hate you'? She said she dislikes you. Something is better than nothing, isn't it? Love or hatred is in heart. That means, I'm in Geetha's heart, isn't it? I'm getting to understand him clearly now. That's what we are also not able to understand. To my dearest Geethanjali ...3 dots! ...yesterday you took a flower from me... I'm in blue ink and from red ink Arya. Geetha is serious, so we too are serious. So tomorrow we're warning Arya To my dearest Geethanjali, ...3 dots! Yesterday you took a flower from me. Today you are making me write a love letter! Full stop. It's question mark about what's in store for the future? Just feel my love... that's all...Underline. Don't bother about friends' comments in brackets. Bye in blue ink, from Arya in red ink. Are you itching for trouble? - No. Will you give a love letter on seeing a girl? - Yes. What? Are you in love with Geetha? But you don't want Geetha to love you? That's it, Shanthi. Give and take is business. If I insist Geetha should love me as I love her... ...will become business. How can it be love? Well said! If your love for her is true... Love is truth; so asking about true love is wrong question. You love her, that's okay. Can't you keep it within your heart? Why are you expressing it openly? Caught on wrong foot. Come again. If you love her, why can't you keep it to yourself? Why are you expressing it? No dear, if it's very little I can hide it. How can I hide so much love? My love for her is so vast that I can't hide it. I'm an extrovert. Suppose if you laugh... - If I laugh? You look terrible. Ajay already loves her. Why do you want to love her again? Do you like Taj Mahal? - I like. You? - I too like. That girl likes it, so you stop hiking it. Stop! Did you ever fall in love with anyone? No You are unqualified to put questions. Sit down. Sit down. Dear girls! Stop asking questions and start loving. You'll never get any doubts. Come girls, let's go. He has given a letter to Shanthi. - Love letter? To my dearest hating Shanthi. I hate you. I started hating you ever since I saw you first. I can live happily without you. From, yours ever hating Arya. Note: Please don't come to HUDA Park tomorrow. Any feelings? Did you feel my love? Didn't feel? What's your problem? Come on tell me. I just want to know if you'd felt my love or not. Didn't feel anything? - No. Not even a little? Didn't feel anything? Don't you've any responsibility towards your lover? Is one-sided love so cheap to you? Look...you are... - Am I handsome? ...you are disturbing me very much. When I think about you.... - Did you think about me? I get irritated. Are you mad? What feel...? You reacted when I said cockroach. Why can't you react a little for my love? I've only one feeling for you...hatred. I hate you. You love to hate me, don't you? - I love. Then, why do you say it with a frowning face? Can't you say it with a smile? I'm fine. Your face shows you've hated me today also. Okay, come let's go and have a coffee. You can hate me over a coffee also. Please don't disturb her, she's hating me. You carry on please. Look...you smiled now. - No, I didn't. No, accept you smiled now. You smiled and I saw it. Okay, I smiled. So what? That means you've started feeling my love. What are you saying? Don't you've any sense? It was my mistake to come with you for a coffee. Why are you confused? You don't love me. You hate me, okay? Why can't you be sincere in that? Why are you smiling at me? Okay, give him Rs.50. He'll go away. Why am I putting up with you? There are so many girls in this college. Why should you love only me and not others? Yes, why am I in love with you and not others? Let me ask them. Why am I in love with her & not you? Any defect in you? Why am I in love with her & not you? Any defect in you? - Mad man. Why am I in love with her and not you? Any defect in you? Sorry! I asked all the girls here and there's no response. You've to feel my love. If you really feel my love, I'll come in your dream. Feel my love with anger... or with hatred... ...or feel my love like a curse, my love. Feel my love like a burden... or far away... ...my love, feel it as a crime. Feel my love silently... or as mean... Feel my love as void or something as or not. Feel my love tearing all the love letters I sent you. Feel my love throwing the flowers I sent you. Feel my love booing the love poems I recite. Feel my love if you are disgusted with my mischief. Saying you don't like my presence. ...claiming you never think about me, ...that you hate me and thoughts about me are bitter. ...thinking you'll never become life partner...feel my love. Feel my love turning your eyes red with anger. Feel my love abusing me wildly. Feel my love wiping me away like dust. Feel my love in the foot marks left behind while leaving you. If legs get tired and burden on hands increases. If eyes feel sleepy and lips stop uttering words. Above all this if you've a heart, feel my love. He's going over the board. - Yes. Tell him. - He's over doing everything. Entire college is behind him. Even girls are supporting him. He's chasing Geetha. She too is... No brother, he can make any girl fall in love with him. He's extremely talented. He never beats us, but breaks everything surrounding him. He'll kill us psychologically. You must do something or else you'll lose Geetha. Where's Arya? - I don't know. Where's Arya? Boy...here! I saw you on my entry and after a long time now. Didn't I say he's powerful? What man? It seems you love Geetha. Don't you want to live? Do you know who am l? Let's fight...Iet's fight it out definitely. But, tell me one thing. Do you love Geetha? He loves her. That's why, we've come to stop you. Does Geetha love you? - Hey, tell him. Are you mad? She said she loves him from roof top. Didn't you hear it? Then, it's all over. Why are you all leaving? Why are you over doing things? - Me? Don't unnecessarily incite me. If you want to continue in this college, Don't talk or see Geetha. Got it? Why are you getting tensed if I love her? My love for her is my personal thing Are you afraid she might fall for me? Is your love so weak? Don't you've confidence in your love? Tell me if you don't have, I'll drop out. He has full confidence in his love. Look, if it is really love between you both, can't separate you. If she falls for my love, then, yours is not love. Calling love, what isn't really love is meaningless. He's confusing me. - Well said, didn't he? What's this carrying bats? To beat me? If you beat me once also, it means you don't have confidence in your love. If you say no, I'll drop out. Why are you always saying about dropping out? Impossible. You must continue. Hey, you stop man! He's confident about his love. If you are really confident... ...accept with a smile whatever I do. - He'll do it. Why are you afraid of him? What's his range? He's the king of this college. His word is a promise. Brother, come let's go. Why are you getting angry? I'm here. Going to Library? - Yes, so what? Tell Geetha, I'll meet her in the evening. He'll tell...come brother, let's go. I'm telling you once again, he has confidence in his love. Go...go...I'll take care of him. Mother! Tell me mother. - How are you dear? Just light fever, that's all. - Did you consult a doctor? I'm under treatment, mother. Take medicines properly. - Okay? Can't you come home? - No, exams are nearing. Aren't we here? We'll take care of her, aunt. Take care of her. - Okay...bye. Come. Is it to develop or shed? Like it man. All right It seems Geetha is having fever, her friend called up. I'll go to her hostel. Going to hostel? I'll also come along with you. It's 2 days since I've seen Geetha. It seems Geetha is not feeling well. Come, let's go and inquire about her welfare. Don't you've confidence? Brother, don't give in, be confident. I was thinking how to reach her. Thank god, you gave me a lift. Why did you stop here? To buy fruits? Is it necessary now? Won't Geetha love you if you don't take fruits? Okay, you've got your own problems. Boy, pack 2 dozens of apples. - No need. Geetha, your lovers have come. Okay, let's play again. Are you fine Geetha? Has your fever come down? Did you take medicine properly? Any way take 2 or 3 days of complete rest. Don't worry about missing classes. I'll take down notes for you. Why are you still standing? Come and sit. Am I talking too much? Good...very good! Great lovers! Walked in empty handed. She's not feeling well. Don't you've common sense to bring fruits for her? I've brought Shanthi. Will you cheat me? - Cheated you? Bringing or not bringing is your personal affair Will you stop if I say? Do I've to tell you all this? Come on girls...Ieave them alone. You both talk to each other. Ajay talk to Geetha. Girls, let's go out and play. Where are you coming? Take the fruits make juice and serve it to Geetha. It all happened because of you. You went out with him and had coffee. If you'd stopped him then, situation wouldn't have come to this. He came along with me now. If I warn, he asks if l don't have confidence. I'm going mad. Why don't you try to understand me? Why are you friendly with him? I'm getting fooled in front of my friends too. It'll be difficult if this continues. This shouldn't repeat again. Don't let it happen again and embarrass me. This time I'm serious. Anyone of 3 stones falling into it. My love will succeed. or else no! One minute! - What? One suggestion! - What? Any way it's not falling into it. If you say love will succeed if you fail to put into it. This is good idea! Stop... It's difficult boss. Every time the opposite happens. Your love will never succeed. You know one thing. - What? I never believe such things. I'll believe if it falls. Oh Gods! We are not able to meet because of Arya. You are also avoiding me saying you've classes. That's why, I called you to the park. No one will disturb us here. Correct boss! No one will disturb us here. Come on take this. Why are you disturbing us? - Me? Isn't this disturbance? Nobody can disturb love or lovers. If they are disturbed then it's not love at all. Love is a penance. a penance by 2 people. Lovers must forget their surroundings. They must forget this world. You both still don't know to love. Please come nearer. Look into each other's eyes. World is slowly disappearing from your eyes. You can't hear or see anything. You are not hearing that flight's noise also. Now you are looking into each other. For present, you both are not here. Why did they go away? When Ajay is not here, I'm the boss. Why are you leading? She's mine. Can't you see properly? Bloody idiot. Get lost. If you say yes, I'll fall for you easily. I want a girl friend... Be careful. I want a girl friend. Please arrange one like this for me too. What happened? He's here only. He'll eat my brain. Why do you look at him like an enemy? He's not such a bad guy. He's little extrovert. That's it. He can be friendly with you and create problems, can't he? There are many who behave negatively for love. He wants to be friendly with you. What's wrong in it? I'm meeting you after a long time. Didn't I say, I'll meet you with my girl friend only? How is she? Why are you going away? That guy is here only.- Who? That Arya. Oh! That one side lover, Arya! Are you afraid of him? Come with me. He's a disturbance. We must disturb others. Never allow others to disturb us. Do one thing, you go & disturb him. What are you looking at? I wasn't here all these days. Now that I'm here, no one can disturb you. You go ahead. I'll take care of him. You're saying hello to me! Did I disturb you? - Disturbing me? No way. We must always be like this only. You brought Geetha here for me. Oh! I forgot to wish you... They'll disturb here. Let's do one thing. Let's run away from here. Let's love each other doing nothing else. Do you know, we have come together. Have a seat. - Don't know. Ajay, come here for a minute. You sit next to her always. I'll sit once. What happened? Geetha, sit down. On this happy occasion, ice creams for everyone from me. Me too strawberry! Then, chocolate for me too! Vanilla? You love chocolate, don't you? I've changed my opinion. - Just like this. You can change your opinion about me, can't you? Okay, let him feel happy, anyway he's a love failure. Did I give him a nasty punch? - Yes. You don't get tensed up. Catch any one of these two fingers. Stop! I like your frankness. You must catch it. My love will be a success. What great success? Your love is born failure. You love a girl who loves another man. How can your love be successful? - Why not? They can split up, can't they? Yes, so many lovers have split. This is Valentine's day. Look, how many couples are celebrating here. There's no guarantee they'll be here next year with same lover. For example, you came with Rani last year. Now, you've came with Rosy, haven't you? It's a lie. Don't believe him. Where did he come from to spoil my love? Ajay, beware of him. You supported him. He's trying to split us. What's this? Do you want them to split? Don't you've confidence in your lover? I've great confidence in my love. Lovers will never split. But those who are infatuated will split. May be they don't love each other. May be it's just infatuation. Geetha would've told I love you to any fool jumping from the roof. That's why, I said I didn't want to speak to him. Talking to him is... ...you know I'm mad about you. I can do anything for you. Come and watch. What's destined to happen will happen at any cost. wake up...Iisten to me. Where there's a will there are plenty of ways. Love is a sweet melody striking your heart. Nobody can say when and how love will spell it's magic. Dance and celebrate. If you fall in love, your heart becomes mischievous. Oh my love realize! There's no greater power on earth than love. Why do you ignore my hand of friendship? with your presence... you've created a sensation in my heart. whether you agree or disagree, you are in my heart. That's true, my dear. In hot sun or a heavy downpour... I'm always with you, my dear. Today is my Geethanjali's birthday. All of you please wish her, from Arya What are you waiting for? Cut the cake quickly. Taste may also change, cut it quickly. Your next birthday may come before you cut this cake. Will you cut or shall l? Come on, cut. Geetha, cut the cake. What man? Was Geetha's birthday celebrated grandly? Geetha is coming. Cool down brother. What happened? Why didn't you come to my birthday celebration? I was waiting for you, you know that? Why didn't you come? Did your celebration stop without me? People you love were there. Love? Oh you mean Arya? Do you know what was his gift? What's this he has given you a shock? He presented your photo to trap your girl friend. He's no ordinary man. You didn't expect this, did you? If he really wanted us to split. Why would he give this gift? You've mistaken Arya. He wants to be friendly with us. That's all. What boss? How is my gift? Is it good? Nothing... She'll feel happy for your photo, so, I gave your photo. I'll give my photo if she'll be happy with my photo. It's not about your photo or mine. Our lover must be happy. That's all! Well said, didn't he? - I'll kill you. Why do you smoke cigarettes? You'll spoil your health. My lover loves you. Don't spoil your health by smoking cigarettes. Do exercise and take fruit juices. I love Geetha and Geetha loves you. So, I too love you. We can't handle him. Your dad is the right man. We must get that tender this year too. No other person must bid for it. Ensure two of our people guard the tender box. Got it? If anyone tries to bid for the tender, Ask Subbu to kill him What's the meeting going on here? What happened? You want money? - No. Any problem in college? What's it boy? - Yes uncle. Subbu, they need your help... ...help them. Take care of tender also. SlLENCE PLEASE. Geetha, Ajay wants you to come immediately. Geetha hugged me. She also kissed me...Arya. Arya really weaved a magic to make Geetha fall in love. He's Arya. Anyway Geetha has great foresight! If she has 2, one will be there if she misses one. Super! Brother, you said it's a routine love tale. But there's a lot of variety Correct! This is shuttle cock love. - What's that? A cock and 2 rackets. - Double game? Why are you passing comments? Don't you want to live? Get lost guys. Geetha...how was the first touch? Was it thrilling? Just because of you... Today, I've become a characterless girl in this college. You've a put my life on notice board. Everyone is looking at me like a prostitute. You are a maniac! You want to achieve me at any cost. That's why you are behaving like this But it is impossible. I don't know what had happened till now. But, I'm telling you now. I'll love only Ajay. I'll marry only Ajay. I'll prove ours is true love. I don't have any problems. You are my biggest problem. I'll be happy if you're not there. I'm your problem, am I not? You'll be happy without me, won't you? I'll never show up my face again in your life. Looks like a mad man... - Yes...may be love mad. May be. This hospital is curing my love's sweet hurt. So, I hate this hospital, Arya. What happened last night in discotheque? If you kiss any girl as you find, will she keep quiet? She's my lover. That's why, did she push you down? What are you blabbering? I'll kill you. You've to hold many people's shirt like this. Not only me, no one here feels you are Geetha's lover. What he said is true? Every one is college is suspecting me because of Arya. They feel I'm forcing Geetha to love me. And she doesn't behave like my lover. But she must. Entire college must believe she loves me. We must do something to make them believe. I know what is to be done. Boys! Plan a tour. When that thing happens, she'll fall into the line. That's it! She'll be your lover if that thing happens. Ensure Geetha comes to this tour. I'll manage other things. Brother...Geetha is coming. It seems you pushed down Ajay last night in disco. Can he misbehave with me like that? Misbehaved? What's wrong if I kiss you? Are you my lover? Do you really love me? I know you don't love me, you are just acting love. Why are you accusing me? - What else can I do? If you both fight like this, Arya's words will come true. Bunty is watching eagerly to see you both split up. Bloody pig face! Moreover a style too. Yes, I too don't like you both fighting. That's why we've planned a tour. Let's all go on a tour. For bringing together estranged lovers, and to make lovers come much closer, So, Ajay and Geetha are coming. Must come...you are coming. What's this tour? Tour means a tour. No lecturers. Just lovers only. I'll not come. Didn't I say she doesn't believe me? Your girl friend is coming, isn't it? They'll come, because they believe you. Forget it. Ajay, coach is calling you. Come quickly. Coach is calling you. Tell the coach that I'm not participating in race. Stop! Geetha, you're spoiling his future. Don't you like Ajay winning the race? Do you know what he'll miss with this game? He has become like this because of you. He's going away... Please call him back. Geetha, please call him back. Why don't you participate in race? Why don't you come to the tour? You want me to come to the tour? Okay, win the race. I'll come. You are sure to win the race. We are going on tour from here. Everything is ready, isn't it? Sit down. Tour is cancelled. I'm not worried for beating me up. If you plan such lousy tours which Geetha hates. I've to make such an entry. You said you'll never show up again in life. Why did you come back? Generally...I never keep up my promises. Did you meet Geetha or not? - No. I don't want to disturb Geetha any more. Geetha mustn't face any problem because of me. Will you stop loving Geetha then? There won't be any walk over in love. One-side love? One-side lover must never feel sad. There isn't a royal love than one-side love in this world. We are loving them. That means we are giving our love to them We are donors and they are receivers. Ours is upper hand and theirs is lower hand. Oh my brother! Listen to me. One-side is always better. If you listen to my advice, No one will ever become forlorn lover Majnu. Observe the words. I love you. There's no meaning of you love me in that. Take the one-way road and march ahead. No one will stop you. Love her one-side freely. You'll never ask her to love in return. It's better than anxiety ridden tragic love, One side love is better as there's no chance to fail. If Devadas knew about this, Would he have taken to liquor? Let there be any number of shattering beauties. There's nothing to lose or nothing wrong...try all of them. Better than asking one girl's love. Love every beauty you see and enjoy. If you fail to get your lover, life will be in jeopardy. If she agrees it's a life time commitment. That's okay, but what's the gain in one side love for us? I'll tell you that too. You needn't dress expensively to dazzle girls. You needn't take loans to give her gifts. No need to talk rubbish on cell phones. No need to take her around on your bikes. No need to use two straws in one soft drink. No need of 2 tickets for a movie. Boss, you're a success. Your love is success. You've achieved in your aim boss! The stone fell into the cup. I'm so happy and why are you so sad? I never thought about it when I tried. - Didn't think? You should think something. When it fell into the cup, you didn't think anything. What sorry? Think of it a 100 times and be ready. Let's match it with the wish whenever it falls. This is fine. Isn't there anyone to ask if beer falls on great sprinter Arya? Did you feel? Did anyone of you feel? Why no one is feeling? At least you feel for it. Will your love succeed if a stone falls into this cup? Though you may win any number of races. You can't win Geetha. Geetha still hates you. Why are you silent? Say something. You generally blabber something. No, I don't want to disturb you both any more. No, I'll get disturbed if you don't disturb us. Don't change your character for me. You must talk. How many times Geetha told you she loves you? Just once! Do you know how many times she said she hates me? These many times!
