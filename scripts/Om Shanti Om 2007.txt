O you hero! Who? Me? Yes, you. Is this your father's jacket that you've put it on and trying to sneak out. Why are you mentioning my father, dress uncle? Was your father raj kapoor? That he could stop our shooting. Chintuji gave me the jacket so i put it on. No one can become a hero by just wearing a jacket. There must be some looks. Give me jacket. You've made a mess of this jacket. Look at this dress uncle. Don't mind him. He's just a drunk can't see a future superstar. Superstar! Will i become a hero? Why not? You will surely become a hero. My mom says that too. Keshtu mukherjee's mother also says the same. Really? - Mother's all same. But you'll become a hero. Because i, pappu master, saying... that you will become a hero. You have everything, style, hairstyle, race, face... and extreme talent. But there's just one thing coming between you and your stardom. What's that? Your name. My name? - Om prakash makhija your bill is due for two months. When will you pay? I will... in this lifetime or the next? Your cream roll also is not from this lifetime. You've been selling it since the times of alam ara. You'll see pappu. When i'll become a big star... i'll get his canteen shut. Remember my name. Om prakash makhija. Just "om prakash" can do the job. But this "makhija"... you can't become star with this. Really? - No. Look, who's coming. Come here. What's your name? Govind ahuja. What kind of name this is? You can't get a job with this name. Do one thing. Change your name with, rohan kapoor, raj kiran, something like that. You'll see producers will line up for you. What if i use just "govinda"? Lets try. - Thank you... you're right pappu. My father had no other name for me. There're many big stars in the industry. Rajinder, jitender, and dharminder. And what he chose... om prakash. Here comes our favorite. Rajesh kapoor. This the name of a hero. Kapoor... name has the weight. Now do one thing. Remove this "makhi" from you name and put kumar, kapoor, khanna or something. Then you'll see. How shot of your luck gets ok in first take. Ok. I could change my name today but... you know... what mom will say? No... hey lord, what i'm hearing. My lovely son, my om, wants to change his name. I ask, what's wrong with this name? We remember lord by saying "om". We remove darkness by saying "prakash". And with "makhija"... we remove flies by saying "makhija". I can live with "om" and "prakash", but with "makhija" as my name, i can never become a hero. Never... you will my son. You'll surely become a hero one day. That's what my heart says. A mother's heart says. To hell with a mother's heart. I can't become a hero in this lifetime with this name. I'll die doing job as a junior artist. Like father. O father of om prakash! It's good that you're dead before hearing all this. Gods! How much you're over-acting? Now i get this, why you couldn't become a heroine. What's this? Me and over-acting? You know, k. Asif called me. For screen test. If you weren't in my womb at that time. Mughal-e-azam's anarkali wouldn't have been madhubala but bela makhija. Your mother. Madhu also handled it well. But if i was anarkali... then it wouldn't be mughal-e-azam but flop-e-azam. Flop-e-azam mom. The truth is... you're a junior artist. Father was a junior artist too. And maybe i'll remain a junior artist as well. Leave me alone. Om, stop son. I've made kheer. (sweet milk) Stupid, he's mad. What's mummy? Why are you standing like this? Look, pappu, your stupid friend again fought and left. He didn't even stop for kheer. Not even for kheer? Then he must have gone to the bridge to see his girlfriend. Girlfriends? Shanti are you fine? All wells? You know why i always come to you. Because you're my only strength. You're my courage, my inspiration, my dream. You're my path and you're my destination. You... i hope you're not getting bored. You know that. How good an actor i am. Mom and pappu also say that i'll become a big star. But i want to become a star only for you. That i could stand with you. And alongside you, i could say... hey... aren't you getting bored? Thanks. This is the best quality of yours. That i keep on talking and... you never get bored. You keep on smiling. I know that you're a dream girl of millions of your fans. But know one thing. No one will love you more then me in this whole world. And yes. Instead of shanti priya superstar, if you were shanti priya super junior artist, i would still be loving you like this. And you will see. One day we will meet. And that day is not far, my friend. Pappu, mom, when did you come? Why didn't you say anything? Didn't feel the need. Let me see my daughter-in-law. She's a jewel. Mom, you are too much. Please forgive me today. I spoke non-sense in anger. No, my son. You'll become a hero one day. Your face will be put on a poster like this. That's what my heart says. A mother's heart says... that ran for 25 weeks. Silver jubilees. Shut up. Mothers' hearts are all same. Yes. Here son, it's thread from sai baba of shirdi. Baba will definitely fulfill your desires. You'll soon meet shanti. Really? - Really. And this can happen just tonight. Tonight? What's tonight. He touched me. - That's great. How do i look? - We always look good in rented dress. When will you announce the good news? Good news is coming next week. I am sure like the previous year, i will get the best actor award this year too. She's asking about the other good news. What other good news? Oh! Baby? That will be soon. Now here comes, the star of the evening. The dreamy girl herself. Shanti priya. What are you doing? He's a super star. You done great my lion. You've grabbed her scarf. Will you keep on standing here? Don't we have to see the movie? But who will let us in? Here's the tickets. Trick worked today. But these are... i know that. I slipped them while taking autograph. Let's go. Mr. Manoj kumar... please come. Hail mother india. Ramesh babu, you can't understand the value ofjust a little bit of "sindoor". It's god's blessings, just a little bit of sindoor. Pushpaa! It's the pride of married woman, a little bit of sindoor. It's the dream of every woman. ...a little bit of sindoor. O pushpaa! Don't do that. Look ahead dude. If real manoj kumar comes, we will get a good beating. No, mr. Manoj kumar is a nice man, he won't say anything. Madam, believe me, i am manoj kumar. Security, check him. Here's my driving license. You're lying... ramesh babu, you can't understand the value ofjust a little bit of "sindoor". It's god's blessings, just a little bit of sindoor. Great! It's the pride of married woman, a little bit of sindoor. Great it's the dream of every woman. ...a little bit of sindoor. Great... clap for him. That's wonderful. This year's filmfare award will be given to your sister-in-law. Yes, but if award jury was here, they would have given you award. Really? - Yes. Will i get award when i'll become a star? Of course. When i'll become a star i'll buy this bungalow. You will. Right now, it belongs to that rajesh kapoor. One day it will be mine. Rajesh kapoor lives like a poor man. I will live in style. Style. There will be 15-16 imported cars. - Style. There will be 50-60 servants. - Style. And there will be bedroom with round bed like yash chopra's set. In style. When i'll wake up in the morning, before putting my foot on the marble floor, one servant... will put soft slippers in my foot. Do you know what the second servant will do? He'll put the silk gown like raj kumar's on me. And the third one will stand on side with juice for me. What happened? You've made me cry? - Why? What happened? You'll get the filmfare award later, but right now press... take photos. I've also wrote a speech for this award. Should i say here? Ladies and gentlemen. I have tried that hard to have you. That everything has conspired to get me meet with you. I couldn't understand anything. Should i make it simple? - A bit. Ladies and gentlemen. It's being said, that if you sincerely want someone to be yours... all the universe starts turning things to get you meet with them. You all have made me meet with my love. Thanks. Thanks very much. I feel like the king of the world. I have believed today that... like our movies, our lives also get all right till the end. Happys endings. If it's not all right. It's not "the end". Film is still unfinished. I love you, i love you all. Shut up. What non-sense you're speaking? I love you man. Get away from here. Look him, what's he saying? Hey drunk! Don't you know him? Who are you? He's the superstar om. You didn't recognize him, he's manoj kumar. Then i'm dara singh. Have you come son? Yes. - It's too late. I was scared. Oh my filmi mother! What's to get scared? No matter how late. But i will come home. To you. Come on, get fresh, i'll bring dinner for you. No, i've had my dinner. And drink too. Forgive me today. I'm sorry. Like you always say that, this moon... who moon? The moon on the sky. Like you always say that this moon isn't a moon, it's a dream that you have seen it for me. Tonight i've touched that dream. With these very hands. Really? Really. My prince. Now go to bed, don't you have to go for shooting in the morning. Makeup man fixed the mustache too tight that i can't open my mouth. How i'm going to say my dialogues? But good thing is no one will recognize you. See that's why i've put a mole on my face. It's amazing, you are absolutely unrecognizable. Assistant director. Should i do everything? Assistant director, find out what's the scene here. And what are my dialogues. Scenes is that, there will be a fire in these fields. Actions. Your dialogue is "run". And then? Is that it? "Run". Just "run". It's a lame dialogue. Lame? I wrote it. Great, what a dialogue? I think the hall will be blown. But there should be some powerful heroic dialogues. Heroic dialogues will be spoken by the hero. Which is not you. There's the hero "vicky sandhu". Call the producer. - That director has gone mad again. Vicky sandu... bastard... see the problems with the heroine. Shot's ready and she says she'll work only after the producer comes. She's asking me, the biggest director. She's telling me she'll work only after seeing the producer. Call mr. Mukesh. What's going on? It's the same. Heroine isn't coming out of the tent. She might not have been paid in last shoot. No, it's mukesh mehra's film. He's a big producer. Be it big or small producer. Those stars have been treating producers like dogs. What did you say? - Controls. Our shanti is not like that. Yes, even mukesh mehra gave her first break. "Bali umar ko salaam" shanti was just 16 years old back then. Mr. Mukesh has come. Now see, the shooting will start in 10 minutes. Mr. Mukesh is handsome. What a personality. He's dashing. Why doesn't he becomes a hero, he's tall. Smarty pants. We never become bandits for any producers, it's just because of mr. Mukesh. You're having too much cough. Shanti will be ready in 10 minutes, get your shot ready. Very good problem solved. It's bad for my creativity. Don't cry for every little thing. It's bombay, it's like this here. This whole scene should be done today. Of course, i've put three cameras. One satyajit ray angle. One bimal roy angle, and one guru dutt angle. Put one manmohan desai angle, that will work. Understood? You took too long. By the way what are you doing after pack-up? Suicide. I'm also ready to die. Sir, you are in the field. Sirju. Run run run sirju, it's your shot. Jump into the fire. Fire is too hot, let it cool down, i will jump. What the hell is happening? Someone save me. Sir, cut the scene, sirju is notjumping in the fire. No, i won't cut until the shot is cleared. Producer has asked me to finish the scene today. Someone help me. In the shooting of mother india, sunil dutt saved nargis like this. They both got married later on. But i'm already married, what's my gain in this. Help me. Shanti is alone there, please go and save her. If you care about her then you go ahead and save her. Someone say "cut". Someone jump in the fire. Doctor can't you reduce your fee? You came for half shift. Is it painful? - Yes. Look here i'm talking to you. If something happened to you, what could i tell you mom? Look here i'm talking to you. But shanti was in fire... - to hell with shanti... there were many to save her. Who was coming to save you? Look here i'm talking to you. Then why are you moving here and there? Shut up. Thank god that you were burnt only on the back. If your face was burnt, then not only you couldn't become a superstar, but you would have to work in horror films. I would have. What could have happened? I would have burned, died. I didn't think anything at that moment. I just saw a wall of fire and behind that trapped shanti. You know, if required, i'll jump notjust once, not ten times, not hundred times but thousand times in the fires where shanti is trapped. In front of shanti's life, my dreams are nothing. Nothings matter. Now look here. Look here. What are you doing like this? I've met many people. But none of them did anything like this. That you did for me being just a stranger. I'm a stranger to you. But for me you're a part of myself without that i'm incomplete. What's your name? My name is the one who always with shanti. Om before shanti and after shanti. Look, i know you're not mute. If you won't tell me your name, how i will thank you. Om shanti - om i think i've seen you before. Yes, maybe on that premiere that night. On posters. You must have seen his film's posters. Madras raja he's rising star of south, omoswami shanti nathan. Who omoswami? You, who else. He's too down to earth. Who would believe his list film was a golden jubilee. Really? - Really? Really. You'll see, shanti ji. Very soon our om will dominate all of the bombay industry. Really? - Really. Of course. By the way, you have earned your first fan today. Not fan, a friend shanti ji. Not shanti ji, just shanti. Can i go? Okay there's rule in friendship. No sorry no thank you.

And mukesh mehra must be punished! This time, it'll be justice with shanti! She'll have justice, and this time, everything will be fine, because, the picture is still remaining! Still remaining, my friend! You want to remake the film "om shanti om" that's ridiculous, i'm serious mukesh! You know mukesh, i have been offered but om shanti om, that's cool, it has emotion, drama, action romance, i'm sure it's going to be a block buster mukesh! Rebirth, who believe in this shit nowadays?

Call me mike, everyone in hollywood does, mukesh became mike, that's funny, mike! And that film's climax was not written, om! That project was bloody jinx! Bloody curse! What curse! Cursing was just for that insurance company who has given you 4 times value of studio when it got burnt!

Before acting, she has to understand shanti, om shanti om is my life story, and i should have tell you earlier. Because you cant be shanti if you don't feel the pain of om. But what would i told, no one would believe in this story. Not even you. Me? You jumps from 50th floor and stand i believe you. You save heroine from 100 villain, i believe you. You fly, walk on water i believe everything, then why you this i wont believe this story? There is still time, this time i will truly try. Mommy? I am glad, fool. In such a short time you got sad script and heroine. My people have already arranged the opening ceremony this ceremony, prays... is this all necessary? I don't believe in this too, that's why we have arrange some thing different from all the places you find this place? You know... yeah this is the place where fire burned the whole set.

I didn't know ramesh, you love me that mush, and want to marry me, here? Forgive me ramesh, i didn't trust you. You are going to land from there in wedding dress like fairy. Have you seen her? Who dolly? No other girl. Blessings of god one "chutki sindur" suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur" don't drink mikey, i think you are drunk. Every women's dream one "chutki sindur" turn off the projector, turn on the lights no one is on the screen, its dolly. Put this reel once again. Watch now, there is no one. Blessings of god one "chutki sindur" suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur" every women's dream one "chutki sindur" see every thing is fine. How this could happen? What could happen? I swear o.k. She was here. I saw her. Here, there, where is that girl you are watching every where. At sets, at make room and here too! You know everyone is saying you are insane. If press find about this... so what am i mad, i am handling every thing alone. You don't even care. And this madness, don't know what happen to you. I don't understand what's going on, i think i should go back to america. I will go back on tomorrow night's flight. No. Mikey you can not go back, i mean in 2 days we are launching music. You have to stay for that. No. O.k. I cant stay, i must go back. And you can handle music launch what's a big deal. In the show press, media and everyone will be there. If producer wont there, how it will look. And i am not you servant, i can not handle every thing for you. One more thing, i can do 10 more movies. And the money you got from market for om shanti om, if it stopped again, you will be on road mikey. You wont do it. I can do this, and i will do it. If you want this thing done, come to the music launch. You gone mad om, how we can prepare everything in two days only. This plan was after 3 weeks. You were there pappu, i had no choice, he was going back to america. I though music release would stop him. But how we are going to finish this plan in two days? There are a lot more work to do at set, artist even sandy is also not ready. I will try om. But if made mistake then? No mistake sandy. We have to make mukesh believe that shanti has really come back. You have to scare him till, he speak the truth. Truth! I have doubt on you plans. Scare him like karz movie. Forget it om he will run tonight if you really need something, the whole world would come to help you he will definitely come, don't worry. Go pappu prepare every thing, i know he will come. Because the movie still not end. Guest will come on flowers sheet from here. There will be 40/30 orchestra playing only shanti's songs there will be fountain falling champaign rather then water. And there will be wedding stage right below this huge lamp. Who are you and how you know all this? Yeah you have discuss all this with shanti in person. Yeah but there was someone else too, who saw your sin too. That was me mukesh. No, how this could happen? That's impossible but that's true. I died with shanti too, i was junior artist in you big movies, i couldn't save my shanti. But i will fight for herjustice you will be punished, mukesh sandy its you queue, you know what you have to do? Yeah, but i am afraid. Its not time to be scared, its time to scare him. Everything is up to you now. So you going to hang me, by telling your reincarnation story ok let me confess myself, coz. Who is going to ask me you or duplicate shanti? What were you thinking, you will plan this whole thing and i will speak the truth? You know ghost doesn't get hurt, there blood don't fall out. He knows every thing, stop shanti. Pappu, door is jammed. Court ask for evidence, and you don't have it. Because if i killed shanti where is her body? Yet nobody find her body. And without evidence, even god cant harm me. I will give the evidence mukesh. Yeah i was waiting for you, you don't have to do stupid acting anymore. Stop this rubbish or i! Or what you will kill me? "Sandy, he knows every thing" how many times you will kill me? "Sanday, he knows every thing go away" shut up both of you, i don't want to listen your bullshit. You have to listen mukesh, listen carefully, when fire extinguished you came back again mukesh yeah... so? To bury my body. This is nonsense. I was alive mukesh, i was breathing. How you know all this? And you bury me alive. How you know all this? Here under this lamp, who are you? Stop sandy! Court need evidence? Evidence will be found. Nothing will find here, nothing is here. Shanti's body will be found under this lamp. Shut up, nothing is under this lamp. Which you buried that night. Nothing is here... no. Om you don't kill him. No. His is going to die by my hand, he will die but not with you hand. Om... omi... om... and you bury me alive. Shanti's body will be found under this lamp. Om... i am sorry... movie still remain my friend!
