Nagapuram's become a base for illegal wine shops. lllegal arms trade is flourishing. lt also houses red-light areas and drugs without a permit. And now, daylight murder as well. This is politics.

TEAM DDH~RG Beauty lies in the eyes of the beer holder. l can tell.. you aren't sober yet from last night. And, you're drinking again. What the... You sell duplicate liquor, but did l complain?

When l found out you're coming.. ..l was on cloud no.9. Really? Wow! What a smile. You're smiling and looking at me. No, l am not. You're making me laugh. - Whatever. Since l saw your picture, you're in my heart and mind. Just keep me in your heart, not in your mind. - Why? Because, it's not nice to stay in empty spaces. - Whatever. Lower the sari! Lower the sari? - Bye. Bye. Hey. old man. Hurry up. Hey, you. oldie. Bye. Aunty. Aunty. That old man eloped with your daughter. That old man's my husband. Husband? Actually, l'm a Hindu and he's a Muslim. l want Seher to marry a Hindu.. ..and he wants her to marry a Muslim. So whenever a Muslim boy comes to see her.. ..l help Seher run away. And whenever a Hindu boy comes to see her.. ..he helps Seher to run.. away. Your personal differences shattered my friend's heart. - Sorry. That's okay, because l'm in love with her. When she looked at me.. ..it felt like someone pierced my heart, Toto. Forget it. Let's go see another girl. We already met 1200 girls, they all rejected me. Help me out before l become a senior citizen, Toto. Fine. From now, this is Toto's motto. l mean eloping like thieves. Your mother and l have trust and understanding between us.

Do you know how powerful he is? He's a feared don. He's got a lot of men. Your name precedes you. But no one knows your name yet. A man's known for his deeds, not his name. Your target is Raju Lamba. lf l kill him, it'll create problems. l'm the main killer for the opposition party. And the ruling party is trying to be the third umpire. So, we need someone new. Money? - 500,000. What? No. Brother. Take it. l don't want a commission either. He's a powerful man. - Fine, 1 million. This is inspector K.V. Reddy.

Stop it How dare you assault a police officer! officer, arrest him. For assault and battering.. ..and for the murder of the opposition's main man. Who are you talking about? He's a murderer himself. That's the same Veeramani who murdered.. ..a High Court judge outside the Ganesh temple. But who are you to uphold the law? l am a man known for his deeds, not his name. l am Deputy Commissioner of Police. Rudra Aditya Devraj. Transferred to Nagapuram. Listen carefully. l'm here to mop the streets! To rid this place of goons! Arrest that officer.. ..under section 120B of criminal conspiracy. And arrest the goons under Goonda Act. Arrest them! Long live.. - Mr. Nagori! Long live.. - Mr. Nagori! Long live.. - Mr. Nagori! Long live.. - Mr. Nagori! Nagori sir. Long live.. - Mr. Nagori! Long live.. - Mr. Nagori! As long as the sun and the moon exist.. ..Nagori will be remembered. Louder! Welcome, sir. Nagori sir... No need to stoop that low. That's outdated. Something new. As long as Twitter and Facebook exist.. ..Nagori Subramanium will be in power. Sir, we just want you to bless us with your grace. And we'll be happy, always. You see. l may not have a voice like Mohammad Rafi.. ..but my power's like Muhammad Ali. Very good. - That's why l am the PM. - PM? 'Politician Maker!' So, shall we? - Not now, sir. Right now.. - No, no. l just want to test my voice. Sir, time for lunch! 'Give me some alms!' 'Give me some alms!' 'l've no change. Cheapskate.' Enjoy your food, sir. Enjoy your food, sir.

Sir.. sir... l like to sit down and eat. - Sir.. - ls the car ready? Nagori sir, there's good news. What? Veeramani, the opposition's main henchman. - Yeah. The police killed him yesterday. Who is the new officer transferred here? DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj. 'oh, God! He's the new DCP.' 'You're dead.' Who hoisted the flag? Sir. - The flag's three inches below the mark. l couldn't see the difference from this distance. lf your wife elopes with your neighbor at a distance.. ..then you won't see that either. Those who are short-sighted, lack power. lnspector Naik. - Yes, sir. You're suspended for a week. At ease. Listen carefully. l don't care if you don't wear your uniform on duty. You can wear your cap backwards. But if anyone hesitates in doing his duty.. ..then l'll lose my cool. And l won't transfer or dismiss that officer. l'll simply gut him.. ..and dump him in the sewer behind the police station. Do you understand? - Yes, sir! There's more to me than meets the eye. l've been transferred here from many districts. DCP Rudra. Born in Mumbai, brought up in lndia. Close your mouth and your zip. You may let the criminals go free. But no innocent should be harmed. Reassure the people that we're their brothers.. ..and the goons, that we're their worst nightmare. All of you police officers together.. ..couldn't curb the increasing crime rate in Nagapuram. Shame on you people! lnspector Javed. - Yes, sir. Sir. l've heard that the department here has a rate-card. Sorry, it was a mistake. But today the management changes. This is a list of those who run a brothel. okay, sir. Names of bike thieves. Weapons and arms-dealers. Unlicensed wine-shops and trucks without permit. - okay, sir. Make their records and files. - okay, sir. Sir, it seems like Gabbar has joined the police force. Can't help it, the place is filled with helpless 'Thakurs'. They need the spark to be invoked. Sir. From today, no more vandalism in this city. only Policegiri. Sir, can l ask you a question? Don't feel offended. No. Are you a goon or police? - Combo. Buy 1 get 1 free. Mind it! You've changed? - Not just me, the entire department did. How? - New boss. Time to meet him. Where's he? Sir, the diamond necklace has been stolen? l didn't do it. How's that possible? Guards. Shutter down. Call the police. - Sir. The police won't respond so soon. With the new DCP in town, the police respond instantly. Subhash. - Yes, sir. Vishal. - Yes, sir. Search everyone. Look, mister.. - Right. Look here. No need to look anywhere else. Here's your thief. l've seen him stealing before. 100'/'. He's the thief. He was asking about the CCTV. Ask them to check the CCTV. Sir. - Yes. My diamond necklace... Sir. Sir? - Yes. The new DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj. DCP sir. Sorry, sir. But my necklace? Where is it? lt's in this bag. This bag? - What? My bag? Here's the necklace. Yes, sir. That's the one. l didn't steal it. l am not a thief. He's the thief. - Him? l didn't steal it. - You didn't. No. Sir, it was me. Take him away. His jacket is loose, just like his character. Look. The thread was stuck on your bag. Thank you, sir. Sorry. Sorry for the inconvenience. Sorry. Sir, l'm really very sorry. lsn't that Seher who had winked at me? l'll be right back. And that's the same goon who almost killed you. You're mistaken. l didn't mean... Next time, think before you judge anyone. l'm really sorry. Listen to me. Just a minute. l said sorry. But why did you steal that bike? l'll tell you later. A nice girl like her with a goon. What's wrong with girls' preferences these days? Girls these days have weird preferences. Seher likes a goon. But l never killed a mosquito. - Why? Because l use an insect repellent. Forget that, and listen to me. lf you want to be her groom, you'll have to be a goon. That's the only way you can win that girl. Wow! Wow! Sir. Sir. DCP Rudra. Why is he so scared? l've been waiting for this day... Let him go. Hello, DCP sir. Come in. Name, Rudra Aditya Devraj. Pet name, Baba. Posting, Sadanandpur. You have a cold bank balance, and a hot temper. You're still single, but you've taken the nuptial rounds... l mean, you've been transferred seven times. Kolva, Vailu, Shirvada, Virur, Sidhpur, Chandrapur. Favorite holiday spot. Police station. Favorite game, bashing criminals. You're allergic to chocolates. Migraine problem. What's wrong? Struck a chord! How do l know so much about you? of course. l know everything about anyone who comes close to me. But no one knows about me. - l do. Nagori Nityanand Subramanium. Pet name, Nunu. Twice married. And got both your sisters-in-law pregnant. Your main business is liquor. 112 wine-shops. 99 belong to you. And 13 without permit. 70 trucks pass by the Narmada. 38 belong to you. And 32 without permit. l can't remember the figures. But you have hot chicks in all your eight lodges as sex-workers. And if we talk about power.. ..you select and reject the MLAs and MPs.. ..from all the eight districts. And in the beginning.. ..you used to beg near Novelty Cinema. Beggar. You're a beggar. And you also suffered from piles back then. You still do, don't you? He knows everything. Since you've arrived in Nagapuram, people are happy. lt's time for you to exit now. Transfer. This discussion is pointless. lf you don't take bribe, l will... Who said DCP Rudra won't take bribe? What did you say? He's honest. He won't accept it? - That's what l heard... Give him a chair! Hey. DCP. After being transferred seven times, l've learned one thing. Money's better than hot-temper. Great. How much? - You say. Padam. TEAM DDH~RG Before l take the money, l have three conditions. What? So, you're going to have a ball, at my expense. - No. You do the wrong thing the wrong way. l just want to do the right thing the wrong way. No.1, your workers want to host a political rally. Go ahead. But if they harass the people, l'll lock them up. And no one will bail them out. No.2, l've no interest in your illegal business. But your goons extort money from the people. lf they don't stop, l'll bash them without a warning. No.3, you own illegal wine-shops. Go ahead. But seven of your wine-shops.. ..are next to temples and schools. l'm not asking you to shut them. Just shift them some place else. lf you accept these conditions, then... Nagori sir... l think we two will get along. What's going on, Nagori sir? You quietly heard all his conditions. Right, Nagori sir. He took the bribe and kept conditions... Forget the conditions. A pet lion is better than a wild dog. He's honest, but he's corrupt. And l'm also attached with him emotionally. -How? My dead brother, his name was Rudramani Subramanium. He touched a chord in my heart. l like him. He could've definitely been an actor. Film star. l mean it. What style. What style. Before you can be a goon, you'll need henchmen. Henchmen? - Bodyguard. First, you'll have to change your getup. Wow! What a getup. Like 'Super-goon'. - Really? But.. there's one thing missing. What? Toto. l want to be the groom, not the bride. That's the rowdy fashion these days. - l see. You mean times have changed. - Yes. But there's still one thing missing. That's deadly. l've fitted your soles with steel plates. Drag your feet on the ground. Set the place on fire. Wow! You look 90'/' like a goon. only 10'/' left.. Fire! Fire! Fire! Throw water. The fire is growing. My feet! My foot's broken. My feet! Sir, l admit my son caused the accident. The victim died due to my son's carelessness. But you can save my son. The deceased's family has lodged a complaint. And this is not a case of drunk and driving. lt's murder. But you can... Yes, sir. 1.5 million. l'll shut down the case. You really outdid it this time. Papa was stunned. l had to. Did you see the boy he invited home this time? Mr. Shabbir Khan. And after marrying him.. ..l could've told my friends My name is Khan. Rascal... Thankfully he didn't cut your legs. Sir, the bad news is.. ..it was Veeramani's henchman here to kill you. And the good news is, he'll be rotting in jail for a long time. The good news is our Gabbar Singh is safe. And the bad news is.. ..our Gabbar Singh has fallen for that Basanti on the scooter. Sorry. Sorry, sir. Her phone's broken. No. Black. l'm no hero, l'm a villain. Nice song. That's not the speaker. lt's coming from the bag. The bag. l'm no hero, l'm a villain. Wow! Strange. Someone's already gifted you the same thing. DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj here. You lost your phone because of me. So, a small gift for you. And you also saved my life. Thank you. - Always mention. What? - Always mention. But how did the new phone get in my purse? Seher. Anything can be placed in your purse. That's right. But DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj.. ..follows the footsteps of thieves. Can't help it. l spend time amongst criminals. lt's bound to have an influence on me. l've been asking you so many times. At least tell me why you stole that bike. Some other day. Today l'm in the mood for something else. Anyway, thanks. - Always mention. What? Always mention. Love's filled with stir. lt's so cruel... The paths of love. l can't stay away from you. Just like a pearl in the ocean. l see God in your eyes. You're my pilgrim. You're my God. Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! You're my beginning and end. l can't live without you. God's my witness. l feel restless every moment. l can't stay away. l can't stay away from you. Just like a pearl in the ocean. l see God in your eyes. You're my pilgrim. You're my God. You're my pilgrim. You're my God. Mr. Nagori. My conscience stops me from doing the wrong thing. Tell your conscience that.. ..too many refusals can lead you to your end. Such negativity is not nice. Everyone's corrupt these days. You can't control three things in lndia. Population, pollution, and corruption. Come on. Approve my MLA's tender. Please, Mr. Nagori. You invited me here, honored me. Don't try to push me. Please stop this game. Game. The game's about to begin. Dice! You see, our meeting's become too dicey. So, this dice will decide your fate. one, two, three, four, five, six. Six lives. one to five, you die. - Nagori. Let's play. What is it? Six. l am saved. l am saved. Mr. Nagori, you said if it's six, l'll live. lt's six. But there's another rule in dice. - What? lf it's six, then repeat. Nagori. Nagori. Nagori. Four! Nagori. Nagori... Get Rajesh Kamat transferred in his place. He's more corrupt than you can imagine. Sir. DCP Rudra's here. - Rudra! Get him out of here. Burn him to ashes in our coal mine. Leave no trace. Location change! Greetings, sir. Welcome. So? Everything okay? - No. Prithvi, the henchman of Dallari area's MLA.. ..is extorting money from people. Come here. Tell Prithvi, if he wants to live, he has to stop all this. - Right. okay. Let's talk. Padam. Lift that... Did you observe one thing? The letter P in life is very important. Like for you, P for Police. P for Public. Same for me. P for Power. P for Politics. And there's one thing common for both of us. 'Paisa' (Money)! That's how it is. Hello. Yes, Seher. Why are you screaming? l'll be there in a while. okay. Who was on the phone? Secret admirer. This won't do. Here's a bigger one. You have a family. You'll need this. Before you leave, just once... That will cost extra. See. Just like my younger brother. At times for pocket money, he would... Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Thank God you're here. Look what's going on there. Shocked, aren't you? Being a government servant, he's openly taking bribe. Don't just watch. Arrest him. Hey, biker. Yes, sir. What, sir? He's going to chew you out now. You're suspended for a week. According to me, taking bribe is worse than murder. People are scared of cancer and swine-flu. But this is the biggest disease. Corruption. They should be scared of it. l'm scared. What? - Nothing. Nothing. Corrupt people should be stoned publicly. lt shows. What? Your temper. of course. What about you? Doesn't your blood boil? l'm scared to death. What? Nothing. l'm losing my temper. of course. lt's the limit. There's a limit to everything. But why are you sweating? Because l'm terrified. - What? l mean the AC's not working. So, l'm sweating. Thank you. Seher. My packet. l'm sorry. What's inside? The original DVDs of 'Singham'! What a great film. You're bound to be carrying such anti-corruption movies. You won't have bribe money in there. Here. Just a minute. That day, you stole the bike.. - Bye. Rudra, l never said my man didn't rape that girl. He did. But a girl that's 18 years old, has a fair complexion.. ..and a body to die for.. ..who wouldn't lose control? lf your daughter had the same qualities.. ..would you let him do her? - Rudra! Volume down! Get up! Take him away. l won't make a case. Gopi. Look. There. - What? Rudra let that rascal go. Sir, that man raped my sister, you let him go. Sir, you let that swine go. What could l do? Arrest him? Do you know what would've happened then? l would've been transferred. But l don't care. Any other officer would've obeyed their command. He would have lodged a case against you. He would've dragged your sister to the court.. ..and proved she's a prostitute. He would've maligned you. Won't we get justice? - You will. You will get justice. Have faith in me. The law won't decide his fate, l will. What's this? l don't want to catch fire again, Toto. Sir, look. Time for your entry. Go. Bash those goons in front of Seher. Come on, boys. Explode. Hey! Leave my red rose, you red bullies. or else, your red blood will flow in all the alleys. Forgive us, sir. - lt was a mistake. We won't do it again. We won't. Look behind. You're a great guy. My getup and my gang.. ..scared these people. So, you were apologizing to him. - Yes. Let's go. You want to humiliate me in front of Seher. Now, l'll humiliate you. - He'll break you. This love-triangle should end now. one girl, two lovers. one power-grenade, two hand-grenades. Whoever wins will be Seher's prince charming. Come on, hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Before every good deed, you should break a coconut. l know. Break it with the hand, right? l can do it too. Coconut. Bring one here. You'll break your hand. Keep it here. Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. People are being cheated of petrol.. ..at the Govind Circle Petrol Pump. What cheating? They're giving very less petrol. Which petrol station? - The one at Govind Circle. No point in telling me. Approach the District Court. -Sir... But sir, a woman from our colony questioned them.. ..and they beat her up. They really bashed her up. Take her to the hospital. Who beat her? - His name is Vijay. How much? - one liter. Cheapskate. ln this. - We don't give petrol in bottles. lf you don't.. ..then l'll fill you up with petrol and light a match. Get that? - Sir. You're Vijay? - Yes, sir. one liter. This is one liter? - Yes. This is Nagori Subramanium's petrol pump. You made a big mistake by hitting me. This is DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj's area. You made a bigger mistake by hitting a woman. You can't hit us because you're a police officer. Yes. And what if we hit back? DCP Rudra's beating us up. Send your men. Nagori sir. The Govind Circle Petrol Pump's been sealed. l guess this is your favorite song? What language is it? - Tamil. l spent some time in Tamil Nadu. This is what l used to hear. Will you have my kids before marriage.. ..or after we get married? - What? l'm just explaining the song to you. Don't try to fool me. You're trying to.. - You think l'm trying to.. ..propose to you indirectly. - Yes. And you're saying yes. Stay here, l'll be right back. No, Rudra. Bless those who give, and also who don't. That's what the elders say. But take me from me.. ..and stab me in the back, that's wrong. That's my saying. You sealed Nagori Subramanium's petrol pump. What did you think? l won't mind? Are you Rudra or Ghajini? You forget. You take bribe from me. Weekly payment. Look here! Look here! Stray dogs don't attend school. Still, they have one in-born quality. Loyalty. And you try to betray me. Who's that? Your girlfriend. The one on the phone that day. Right? l sent some for you too. Did you get it? Better tell him to be loyal to his masters. Hey! one thing. l might not have a voice like Mohammad Rafi.. ..but l have the power of Muhammad Ali. Next time you make this mistake.. ..l'll fill you with bullet-holes. Because l'm a beggar and a hunter. Combo. Buy 1 get 1 free. Leave me. Great, Nagori sir. Take a pause. So can l give you some good news? What is it? - Your petrol pump's been reopened. Really? - Yes. Don't get me wrong. l'm just happy. Petrol rates are touching the sky. Rs.76 per liter. But Nagori's power has no boundaries. So, l got the petrol pump.. ..as well as Rudra came to his senses. What do you mean, Nagori? Will you just let off Rudra with a warning? That's it? l say let's play the game of dice with him. He's done my bidding. Secondly, he reminds me of my brother. And he didn't say anything before his girlfriend. Don't judge the book by its cover. He was calm before his hot lover. Ups and downs are common in relationships. As long as corruption prevails.. ..Nagori and Rudra will stay friends. Call him to our farmhouse. We'll sing, dance.. reunion. Music. Roll 1 in orchestra. Sway! Sway! Sway! Sway! Sway! Sway! Sway with the beat. Sway with the beat. Love's the divine play of Krishna. Sway with the beat! Love's the divine play of Krishna. Sway with the beat! Love's the divine play of Krishna.

Love's the divine play of Krishna. Sway with the beat! Love's the divine play of Krishna. Sway with the beat! Love's the divine play of Krishna. Bless those who give. And also those who don t. But whoever humiliates me in front of my love.. ..l never spare him. Your men beat up a woman. They're the public! And those who don't respect the public, l put them down. Hey, you're not wearing clothes. l am not your man, or dog. l take bribe only to hide your crimes. Not to do my duty. Mind it! Where's everyone? He was right here now. Where's he now? lt s the divine play of Lord Krishna. Seher. You're not eating your sandwiches. What's wrong? - Nothing. Yeah, Seher. What's wrong? You haven't been talking properly with anyone. What are you doing? Where are you taking him? - Leave her. Let go. - Don't scream. Seher! Somebody. Please help! Rudra. You don't answer my calls. or meet me. And you don't want to listen to me either. So, l had to get you abducted. What do you want to say? Do you take bribe? - l do. That's it. End of conversation. Seher. one minute. l don't need to explain to anyone.. ..what or why l do anything. But l think it's important to tell you. Because l love you, damn it! lt s true that l took bribe. But you didn't try to understand why. When l joined the police department.. ..l was an honest officer. But in return of my honesty.. ..my seniors gave me transfer orders. l would be transferred within three months from every posting. Due to the pressure of the politicians. That's when l decided.. ..that l'll have to dirty my hands to clean this system. l did take bribe, Seher. lf l hadn't taken bribe from Nagori.. ..l wouldn't have been able to clean the streets of Nagapuram. My friends saw you two together. You two were in a romantic pose. Yes, papa. We were in a romantic pose. Because l love him. - What? He's a thief. He stole that bike that day. What do you have to say? Actually, l didn't get an answer for that yet. But he did steal my heart. And l want to marry him. - You can't marry him. l mean.. Hello. - Hello. Hello. Aunt's looking for a Hindu, and uncle's looking for a Muslim. Right. l want a son-in-law of my caste. And l want one of my caste. Now, match this combination. l'll fulfill your wish. How? My mother was a Muslim, and my father was a Hindu. This is no joke. l am a combo of the two. l'm a Hindu, and a Muslim. l don't agree. - Quiet. Forget religion. lf you hear his deeds, you'll regret heavily. First ask him. What do you do? l'll tell you. He's a gangster. - What? You look like a goon. l'm just a copy, he's real. l'm fake, he's reality. l'll tell you the reality. He's.. DCP.. Rudra.. Aditya.. Devraj! l see. So you are DCP Rudra. You've completely changed Nagapuram. Seher. Religion isn't important. His deeds are all we need. - No, no, no. This marriage isn't possible. lf you go ahead with it, l will commit suicide. This marriage is possible only over my dead body. Let's see. over his dead body! Come on. You were asking about him. He's the bomb-maker. Nagori sir, this mobile's fitted with a bomb. Keep it away. lt explodes only when you press the green button, sir. Don't worry. Press this green button, and Rudra's dead. Tonight& l know when to do what. You can leave. Here. We'll execute this some other day, not tonight. Nagori sir, what do you mean by not today? That Rudra humiliated you.. - He disrespected you. He dishonored you. He disgraced.. - Quiet! There s no tax on speaking, so everyone s blabbering nonsense. l know. He barged in audaciously and mortified me. But what did the ruling party say just now? They've ordered a 'close-down' tomorrow. lf we kill Rudra today.. ..then everyone will think the curfew's for his death. Do you want to make him a hero? Rudra's time will come. But this isn't the right time. Venkat, Prasad, listen carefully. lt's the question of the party's reputation. Everything should be closed tomorrow. lf anyone tries to oppose, gut him. Sir, please do something. Do something. - Hold on. Wait. Sir, it's the festival of Dussehra. We paid extra to stock goods in our shops. But the party's announced a 'close-down' tomorrow. So, what about us shopkeepers? Sir, l mortgaged all my jewelry.. ..to buy stocks for my husband's shop. The 'close-down' will create problems for us. We'll incur great losses. Please do something. Do something. Wait. Wait. Lodge your complaints. l'll deal with it. Thank you, police uncle. Tomorrow, you'll do double business.. ..and we'll do double duty. - Yes, sir. lf Rudra does double duty.. ..we'll create double trouble. Close down the shops! Close down the shops! Nagori's goons are here. Look. Everyone. The DCP's here. Alone. Single entry. - Right. Single entry. First the engine, and then comes the bogies. lf you don't leave in five minutes.. ..then l'll make you regret it. Two minutes. l give you two minutes. lf you don't leave, then l'll make you regret it. What can you do? The same thing that the police do. Lathi-charge. Shoot tear-gas. What else? We won't leave.

Shoot you, in the leg. Forget it. Now listen carefully. lf anyone raises their hand, l'll break it. lf you torch a bus, l'll torch you alive. lf you kill, it's murder.. ..and if we kill, we get an inquiry commission. And handling the inquiry commission is easy for me. There's more to me than meets the eye. l've been transferred here from many districts. My name's DCP Rudra. Born in Mumbai, brought up in lndia. Mind it! Javed. - Yes. What's important before doing a good deed? Coconut. Charge! The avatar of Shiva is here to save Nagapuram. Rudra. - Who is Rudra? DCP Rudra. Yes, sir. okay, sir. Sir, we ve just got information from the control room. There's no problem in any of the areas. Sir. Did the ruling party organize this 'close-down'? lt's not about ruling party or opposition. lt's about right and wrong. l'm a public servant. And l protect the public. one more thing. People here are hard of hearing. l would advice them to increase the volume of their TV. lf someone does wrong, l'll kill him. And if someone does the right thing, l'll give him a hug. Sir, what's the good news for today? Some good news. Sir's getting married nine days later. And nine days, nine months later... He just humiliated me in the entire Nagapuram. He wants to weaken my power in politics. l'll have to teach him. Wedding. l'll have to give him a gift. Do you accept it? l accept it. Do you accept this alliance? - l accept it. Drink poison. Let the marriage get over. DCP sir. Welcome. New groom.. ..here to take my blessings after the marriage. But l already sent you gifts. Anyway, now you can celebrate.. ..the wedding and Nagapuram's death anniversary together. Nagori! No matter how loud you scream.. ..but only my voice is heard here. And the lives of the people. Don't they have any value? They do. But what to do? Since you straightened up, so did the people of Nagapuram. They needed a wakeup call. So, l put everyone to sleep. So next time, before doing anything, you ask me first. Who are you? Are you the Collector? The government? Even bigger. Look at you. Salary, 45,000. A uniform, a pair of shoes.. ..and control over a few police stations and officers. Yet, you've got pride. And me. l singlehandedly control eight districts, 90 MLAs, 16 MPs.. ..and four ministers. So, think about my pride. l may not have the voice of Mohammad Rafi.. ..but my power's like Muhammad Ali. Here. Power. No. You simply took revenge. You could've taken your revenge from me. You killed innocent people. Police officers. You even killed children. You did what you had to do. Now, it's my turn. Eight districts, 90 MLAs, Ministers, 40 cars. Politician Maker title. l'll snatch all that from you and throw you on the streets. Just like a beggar that you were. And if l fail, then l won t be called Rudra Aditya Devraj. Mind it! You'll get your transfer order before that. That's such an old dialogue. Everyone knew you were going to say that. But today, l've something new to say. l have my transfer orders. l'll be transferred in seven days. But that's all l need to ruin you. lt'll be your empire, but l'll chuck you out of it. Rudra! No matter how loud you scream.. ..but my voice will be heard. You might have the voice of osama.. ..but l have the power of obama. Combo. Buy 1 get 1 free. You two are waiting outside? - We are waiting for you. Where's Seher? - Seher? Seher said you called her to the police station. Two police officers were here. They took Seher along in the jeep. Seher. Where are you? Goons are after me. Where are you? - At the end of Nehru Street. l see. There's a mosque to your left. l crossed it. There's a milk centre in front of you. Hide there. Yes. Where are they? They left. - They'll be back because it's a dead end. Get out of there, and run towards the main road. Go! Hello. Phone. Seher. Rudra. People are right. No one can forget their wedding night. Where are you going? This is the only job where extra hours are fun. Your age's gaining mileage. Seher. Love doesn't see age, only the waist. - l see. What happened? You're vibrating at my touch. Strange. What's wrong? - lt's not me. lt's your phone. Hello. - Sir, Javed here. There's bad news. We just received information.. ..that someone has planted a bomb at the bus stand. We don't know what to do. okay. lnform the bomb-squad. Don't let the public inside. l'll be right there. Hello. - Sir, the bomb isn't at the bus station. lt's at the railway station. Because the bus station is less crowded. Who are you? Hello, DCP Rudra here. Hello, sir. There's a bomb at the government hospital. Who are you? - Kamla. From the market. Sir, a person came here in a hurry and asked.. ..to tell you that there's a bomb here. Yes. Where's the bomb now?

Look there. There it is. Just like l promised, it's under the statue. Balm. Tiger balm. You've been running around all day. Your legs must have grown tired. Apply some. Go on. Before that, answer the phone. You'll be shocked to hear the voice on the other side. Hello. - Rudra, Commissioner Trivedi here. Yes, sir. Did you lose your mind after getting your transfer order? Why? What happened, sir? Are you on a road-trip with the bomb-squad and police force? Sir, l received calls of bomb threats. What could l do? l couldn't take a risk with the public. Did you trace the call? lf we attend every call.. ..then who will do the rest of ourjobs? Sir, those bomb threat calls were right. l've found the bomb, sir. - Where? ln MLA Prasad's car. Hello. He disconnected the call. You have to give respect to take respect. open it. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Get him out! Rudra. Death's never spared anyone. Someday it'll be me, but tomorrow, it's your turn. The commissioner. Do you know what orders l just signed? MLA Prasad will be holding a procession. You have to provide them security. So, prepare a battalion. Sir, there are chances of a riot. You should cancel this permission. You know, the orders to sanction this permission.. ..came from my superiors. order. Sir, your condition is just like a waiter s. All you do is take orders. - What? Come here. - Yes, sir. What did you just say? - Sir. Before that? Waiter. l am a waiter at home, not here. - Yes, sir. Rudra, this is my advice, not an order. Being enemies with Nagori could be dangerous. Be his friend. Sir. Too many chocolates can lead to diabetes. Too much alcohol, liver trouble. And being friends with me can lead to enemies. Talking to him means getting a headache. This is what you need to do before you kill them. We'll have to follow this plan together. Because this entire conspiracy is to kill me. Tomorrow, it could be your turn, Javed. Then you. You. And you. on the way, you'll come across Rajappa's cold drink stall. Goons will be supplied cold drink bottles from that shop. That will be their first weapon. Ten steps ahead, you'll come across an iron workshop. lt belongs to Peter. He'll supply abundant knifes and axes. We'll strike before the iron is hot. He can't shoot. Rudra won't get shooting orders tomorrow. Because l've sent the Collector on a holiday. l won't need the Collector's permission. Because l know how to do the right thing the wrong way. The right time will be when you pass the petrol pump. We'll surround Rudra and his men and kill them publicly. No one will stop you there. lf there's anyone who can ruin our plan, then that's the press. And we have to stop them from taking photos and videos. ls that understood? - Yes, sir. Javed. - Sir. Are the market people with us? - Why, sir? Because tomorrow.. old scores will be settled. Are you ready? We've crossed the mosque. Get the weapons from Peter's shop. Just a minute. Rudra. Why did you divert the route? The road's closed ahead. But it wasn't dug-up until yesterday. But it is today. Let's go that way. No, this is a conspiracy. Police cruelty! Police cruelty! Police cruelty! Police cruelty! Padam. We won't get anything here. Call up our men. Ask them to join us. Let's cross the petrol pump first. lt'll be easier to kill Rudra then. Call him. Rudra will die today. Police cruelty! Yes, sir. We're close to the petrol pump. Just give us a missed call. ls everyone ready? They're coming. Police cruelty! Police cruelty! Beat him! Don t spare them. Beat them. Charge! Tear gas. You raped my sister! Rascal! Do you know what you did? We'll teach you. Arrest them! Here's my gun, sir. Fully loaded. How can l shoot when l didn't get the orders? What are you looking at, sir? l doubt your intentions. Shut up! Damn it! This is serious. Many people died. one of them was an MLA. lf you didn't shoot, then who did? Sir, how would l know.. ..who opened fire in that huge crowd? The CBl is handling this case. l did tell you to cancel that procession. Fine, release those two MLAs. - okay, sir. Give me written permission that you take responsibility. And l'll release them. Do you want to implicate me? No, sir. l want to save you. As long as this matter doesn't cool down.. ..let those two stay inside. Don't blow yourjob, sir. What? Blow yourjob, sir. Fine, let those two rot inside. Look, Rudra.. ..don't lock horns with Nagori. When you shatter the glass.. ..it's you who gets hurt, not the glass. Sir, this uniform is no less than a bulletproofjacket. No one can dare to touch it, and live. Hello, sir. - What hello? He's bumping my men, and you're saluting me. Shoot me! Nagori sir. Their guns don't have bullets. lt's just a show-piece. ln Rudra Devraj's reign, everything's loaded. Nunu. Are you here to surrender? - No. To write your biography. You're a goon, not an officer. You're no combo. you're like the congo drums. You've been beating everyone up. He shot my men. Hey. No need to tell them. l did it with their help. What are you supporting him for? You think he's honest, sincere? Nunu. You killed people at the market. And l killed your men on the streets. And those l killed& Do you have a record? No, sir. You will pay. You will pay for your deeds. What will you say next? My Karan and Arjun will definitely return. Get lost. Rascal. You dare point a finger at Nagori Subramanium. Lower your finger. Don't talk to me like that. You're finished. Your entire empire's.. finished. one, two, three, four. Four days later, you'll be licking this. This. You'll be begging for your life.

Please, papa. lf you don't save us, they will kill us. l thought about your family and spared you that day. lf you don't do as l say, l won't spare your family. What do l have to do? Become an approver for the bomb-blast case. What are you thinking? At least do one good deed. 'on the day of your marriage..' '..we went to the market to take revenge..' '..from the people who were against Nagori sir.' 'How many can they kill one by one?' 'Give me that phone bomb.' 'Scared, right? - Yes.' 'What now?' 'My mom and dad.' 'They will kill all of us.' 'Everyone will die.' 'No one will save us.' 'There's Rudra sir. He's getting married today.' 'l will call him. - Yes.' 'But he won't recognize me.' l'll hand you the phone.' 'Go to your dad. - okay. And ask him to press this button.' 'And ask him to speak. okay.' 'Green button.' 'Green button.' 'Go on.' 'Papa. Papa.' 'Here, papa. Speak here. - Yes, son.' 'Call him, quickly.' 'Hello. l can't hear a thing.' 'Press the green button.' 'Papa!' l was with Nagori, sir. And he's the man who supplied the bomb. Later, Nagori had a small kid detonate that bomb.

You can talk to the CM, as well as the PM. But first let me talk to my MP. MP meaning Man of Power. Rudra! l will try. Try. Try, try. Hello. Rudra. - Yes, sir. Where are you? on my way to arrest Nagori. Come and meet me in my office first. lt's an order. Sir. Sign, sir. Who's inside? Ministers, the Collector. MLAs, MPs. Every white-collar from the district. Sir, my pen. Take it when he comes out. DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj. Recognize me. l'm the officer.. ..that promoted you in Nagapuram. So? Do you want a commission? Don't joke. l order you. - What? You won't arrest Nagori. - What? This case will be handed to a different officer. Actually, sir, this city's made me hard of hearing. Rudra! lf you arrest him, it'll create problems for us. But you'll have more problems than you can handle. No ordinary MP can spell trouble for me. You can all lick Nagori's boots. But l will make him lick the ground. Rudra. You can't talk to the MP like that. How else do you want me to talk to him, sir? Anyone who supports a man.. ..who's got a warrant against him under Terrorist Act.. ..l'll use this language for him. Fine, we admit we're supporting Nagori. We also admit that we're wrong, corrupt. You aren't honest either. You've taken millions from Nagori as bribe. Nagori's maintained your account in this file. The amount and the number of times. The date. He has the entire account. He's taken your photos from his cell phone. Look. There's the evidence. His men are good photographers. Now you'll say that you didn't take 5.5 million from him. No, sir. l took 5.75 million from him. Here. Match my accounts with his. lt contains government receipts.. ..for all the days l took money from him. First receipt's in the name of Nagori. So that another beggar doesn't turn rabid like him. 2 million for the Beggar Relief fund. Nagori burnt down many houses. So, 1 million for the contract to make new houses. He orphaned many people. So, l donated millions in the orphanages. And then, he cheated the government as well. So, l donated some money in the Chief Minister's Relief fund. Sir, all his accounts are clear in this file. Just a minute. What about the 15 million that he took for the accident case? Yes, what about that? The culprit in an accident case is sentenced to three months ofjail.. ..and fined 50,000 rupees. But what about the deceased victim's family? l gave 1.5 million to the victim's family. You can ask them. l am a public servant. l'll serve only the public. Mind it. Are you a police officer or a goon? Combo! What are you saying, Rudra? You want to uphold the law. What the& What law? one that keeps changing from state to state. lt's illegal to drink liquor in one state, and legal in another. Prostitution's legal in one, and illegal in another. Every caste has a different law. And every state has a different rule. l work according to my rules, not the law. Just like you, we do as we please. And we'll do the same with you. What we'll do to you will be really bad. Are you threatening me or scaring me? Just telling you what's going to happen. What if we arrest Nagori? Then we'll kill you right now. Try and touch me. The entire police department's with us. They will follow our orders. of course they will, Mr. Collector. Does anyone else have anything to say? Go ahead. Say it. Now, our weapons will speak for us. We can decide your fate right now. Great. That's the end of today's show. This much footage is enough. Footage? - Yes. Everything you said.. ..has been recorded in this 4.5 megapixel camera. oh, no! This is just like me. Combo. lt writes and records too. Wow! What clarity. They wanted to kill the DCP in the Commissioner's office. What's this? Such dangerous weapons& ln the police headquarters. ls this ajoke? This is disgraceful. Weapons here, with this high security. Foreign powers can infiltrate us too. What's this? Why did the government award you with these stars? You get salary. Hog for free. Ripping off the government. You should be ashamed. Rudra. Sit down, son. We will sort it out. We will discuss it. No more discussions. l'm going to arrest Rudra. From the media to the Assembly.. ..anyone who wants to ruin his reputation.. ..can try and stop me. Mind it. Sir, my pen. Thank you. You can't do anything. Give the phone to Minister Raghupati. Take this. Number two? Hello. The minister's pissed in his pants. What? l mean, he's taking a leak. Look, don't worry. lt's just a matter of one day. Rudra will be transferred tomorrow. And the new officer will be in our control. Just go stay with your uncle for a day in Murshidabad. Commissioner. - l'm sorry, sir. We're helpless. Nagori sir. The police are patrolling Nagapuram borders. lt's difficult to flee. We checked many cars, sir. We've arrested many of his men. But there's no trace of Nagori. Check every car. - okay, sir. Block all posts. What happened? Did they speak? l beat them black and blue, sir. But no one's speaking up. l think they don't know anything about Nagori. Sir, you're getting transferred tomorrow.. ..and Nagori's not been arrested yet. Have the police lost? Winning and losing is decided when we play the game. But Nagori turned out to be a fugitive. His cowardice is my victory. - Sir. What should we print now? - The truth. DCP Rudra has received Nagori's arrest warrant. But he hasn't apprehended Nagori yet. He's still at large. The police department's making failed attempts to find him. Seher, what's this? So far from the city, and this temple. Yes. That's the specialty of this temple. Every prayer has been answered. l venerated Lord Shiva, and found Rudra. Your prayers have been answered.. ..but mine's yet to be. Bow before Him, because fate bows before Him. Spare me some change in the name of God. God will bless you. Didn't l tell you? l've no change. Pardon me, Nunu. How did you know? 'Rudra. There are too many beggars here these days.' l've been noticing.. ..one of the beggars is having a problem in sitting down. That's when l remembered. You're suffering from piles. Didn't l tell you that one day, l'd chuck you out on the street? l am on the street. But this is where l am going to bury you. Because, l am a mountain. lf you're a mountain, l am Hanuman. And Hanuman picks up mountains on his palm. Deal with them first. First, deal with this. Move back! Move back! Mummy Returns! Go on.
