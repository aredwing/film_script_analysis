Youre the one whos gonna be famous. Hi, Carl. Hey, dad. Hey, mom. Hey, Charlie. Give me the camera. OK...Clive. l come out with my back to the audience. Total mystery and drama. With the fog machine? Smoke, Stevie wind, the whole damn nine. And l take off my cape. And three white-winged doves fly out. And then, at the height of the guitar solo... l come center stage. And l fuckin twirl. Stop. Youre giving me wood. Go, baby! Go! l want the world to hear my voice, you know. l want them to write my lyrics on their AOL profiles... just like they do Stevie. And when my CD comes out... l want all these assholes to line up at the fucking mall... and kiss my ass one sound-scan at a time. Excuse me. May l ask you a question? Do you think its appropriate to dance in a graveyard? Dont you think that we should dance while we can? l think you should have more respect for the dead... and especially for yourself. Excuse me? l didnt want to mention this... but you could be a very pretty girl... but that would be inappropriate for any young lady... especially for someone your size. Look, Granny, l am a pretty girl, OK? Big is beautiful. Havent you heard? And for the record, l dont give... a flying fuck or a rolling rimjob... what you or anyone else thinks of me. Youre dismissed. Hey, G. Hey, daddy. lts gonna have to be the Colonel tonight. OK. Nails. Cheers. How was work? Fucking fabulous. And you? lt was pretty good. l signed up a new kid for lessons today. Thats awesome. Whats this? Something to write your lyrics in. l love it. Thank you. Why dont we do one of your old Luna Angel tunes? Crystal Sea? OK. l fell into a crystal sea lnside a ship of fools like...me Was it just a dream? Was l floating round in circles? Oh, your face, your face ls all l see lll be waiting here, my love Forever and a year, my love Waiting here for you, my love Forget your trench coat, girlie boy? Piss off! Hey. Hey, Lois. Nice outfit. Thank you. l like it. My brother, hes in the basement. Gypsy? This whole...gay thing. He thinks we cant deal, but cripe... l had a gay friend in college.

Not yet. Could you please just ditch the fucking term paper... and fix my face? How could l improve on perfection? All right, Mr. Straight-A... lm not getting nearly enough hard-core fagma this afternoon. lm sorry. lm just kind of down today. lll help you get it up. lm kidding. Whats your paper on? Stevie Nicks, unlikely godmother of goth. Sterling. Did you check on the Nicks-Pix? They just posted some delicious new photos. Oh, my God. What? The goth nightclub Mother announces... their fifth annual Night of a Thousand Stevies... to be held on Tuesday, May fifteenth, in New York City. A strict Stevie dress code will be enforced. Suggested attire is... Like a White-Winged Dove Stevie realness... all periods, including Rhiannon capes... metallic shawls, babys breath, platform boots... leather and lace, tophats, beribboned tambourines... and the best hair in rock-and-roll. Performers are to be selected at an audition screening... before the show and compete for awards... selected by a judging committee of Stevie experts. Oh, my God. Let me see. What? Nothing. lts just...lts cool. Oh, my God. This is in four days. We have to go to this. You have to perform. Earth to Gypsy. Do you regret not taking Luna Angel to New York or L.A.? You know, building on the Cleveland triumph... really going for it? Where did that come from? ld like a real answer, dad. No bullshit. Not anymore. You think l have what it takes... to make it big or whatever? As a totally objective party... l think you are a superstar. What if l told you that l know where Velvet is? Look. These were taken several years back... at a club in New York City, and lm thinking about going... performing. And maybe shes still there. We agreed that your mother is dead. l know, but maybe she had a reason. Maybe she could explain. You know the reason, baby. l know. You dont ever wish you went with her? Everything l need to make me happy... is right here in this room. This is the life. Last night, l dreamt we were in New York City. We decided to stay. We never came back. Thats a good idea. Then you could completely drop out of school... and trash your 4.0. Thats smart. Yeah. Fuck it. l dont... l cant go. lts just shitty timing, you know. Maybe next year we could go. We could plan more. No, we could be dead next year. lm sorry, sweet child. Youve been talking about getting out of Sandusky... since l met you. Yeah. Well, Sanduskys not that bad. My dads here. OK. Look me in the eye... and tell me that youre happy in Ohio. lm happy in Ohio. Did you just have an aneurysm? Sometimes life is a tradeoff. Youre eighteen, and you dont get it. Get off the gown. Youre twenty-five, and youre gonna be here... until they bury your ass. Admit it. What about our dreams? My mom is alive. She bailed on us. Bye-bye. When? 1983... April thirteenth. She moved to New York to be a big-time rock star. Ended up tending bar... at Mother. And you dont want to see her? No. l dont really give a shit about her. Shes your mom. Dont you fucking lecture me, kiddo. Shes been dead to me since before you were born. lm sorry. l bet you are. Did you say good-bye? You? No. Were runaways! Farewell, Sandusky! l dont think l ever want to have sex. - lm serious. - OK. l just want someone to kiss... with big, soft, delicious lips. Hed have to smother me in old-school romance. l mean, candles and incense... Moet and Chandon... but only in a deserted castle in the south of France. Oh, my God. You are so much more of a girl than l am. Sex just seems so...messy. Oh, no, no. Sex can be awesome. Not that l would remember, but... Maybe you and l should try. l think lm past my wayward-sex fag-hag test-fuck phase... but thank you for the offer. lts just been there, done that. At least ld know for sure. Honey, youre a queer, with a capital Q. OK, you know what? Some of us... dont care to be defined by our sexuality. OK. Sorry. Can l ask you a question? What? Are you gay? Yes! But l dont have anything in common with those people. l mean, like l give a rats ass about Judy Garland... or...Stonewall. Being queer is a very small part of me. Yeah, whatever. Wow. So much beauty... all in one place. Please give a warm welcome... to international recording artist... and karaoke hostess extraordinaire... Miss Bambi LeBleau. We love you, Bambi! Maestro. Yeah, girl! When Sunny gets blue Her eyes get dry and cloudy Then the rain begins to fall Pitter-patter, pitter-patter Love is gone, what can matter When no lover comes to call? When Sunny gets blue She breathes a sigh of sadness Like the wind that stirs the trees Wind that sets leaves a-swaying Like some violins are playing Weird and lonesome melodies People used to love To see her smile and laugh Thats how she got her name Since that sad affair She lost her smile and changed her style Somehow shes not the same But memories will fade Pretty dreams will rise up Where the other dreams fell through Hurry, new love, hurry here Kiss away each lonely tear And hold her near when Sunny Gets blue Thank you so much. Shes a genius. l think lm in love with her. How are you feeling tonight? My name is Bambi LeBleau... and lm delighted to be your hostess... for an evening of karaoke in Maryland.

God, what the hell are you doing in the middle of nowhere? lm out to pasture, retired. You dont miss it-- the big city and all the buzz-buzz, glamour-glamour? The truth is no. The first record was a smash, but then music changed. Tits and cocktails went out, and the hustle came in. Of course, that didnt stop me from beating my head... against the wall for 20 years. One day l just woke up, looked in the mirror... and said, Give it up, girlie. lm sorry. l dont get it. You made it. You had a hit. l had a blast. Thank Christ l socked away the big bucks... while l was still making them. So now lm just... living the good life. You got a husband and kid stashed away somewhere? Never wanted them.

Sorry about that. Guess what. Bambi said yes. Are you sure its OK? Yeah. lts awesome. This is gonna be so cool. Try as we may, l guess the dream never dies. Does it?

Your ass belongs back in school. Turn around...please. Fuck. Fuck. The night that Velvet left... dad just didnt know how to deal, you know. So he looked me straight in the eye... and he said, Your mother left us... because she loved her dreams more than she loved us. Bambi never had a hit. Shes a drunk. She rolled the dice, and she came up bust. Just like Velvet. Bingo. So you abandoned her like Velvet did you? Maybe l refuse to give up my life for a pipedream. Were going home now. Dad and Lois must be worried sick. Theyre grownups. They can take care of themselves. lm not doing it to my dad again. Get in the car. What happened at talent night? Excuse me? ln third grade. Screw you. No. Gypsy, please. Just tell me. All right. Spring jubilee, talent night. Velvet taught me one of her favorite Stevie songs. We practiced for weeks. And dad showed me the chords on the guitar. Anyway...a week before my big debut... Velvet splits. But l go through with it anyway... because shes gonna show, right? l mean... Shes got to show. So... all the cutesie little kiddies... and their perfect mommies and daddies are there. And l get up on the stage... singing and playing my little guitar... And l pissed my dress. lt ran down my leg and dripped off the stage. And some guy with a mop came out... and told me to get back to the audience... and go find my mom. Come here, sweetie. Cool. Pick him up. - Are you kidding? - Come on. The Amish rock. Hello. lm Zachariah. lm running away. OK. So, Zachariah, have you ever been in a car before? Never one this radical. Do either of you have a cigarette? You can smoke? As of this moment, l can do anything l damn well please. So, you running from something? Conformity. Boredom. And cows. May l pump? Sure. Awesome. What do l do? OK, no problem. First, you unscrew the gas cap, like so. On some cars, theres a button on the inside... you have to press to unlock it, but this is an older model. And then you make your octane selection. Were on a budget, so well use this one. And then you put it in the hole... and you simply pump away. Yeah. l really like your clothes. lm dying to get out of mine. Hes gorgeous. Come on, man. So is Norman Bates. l know l would kill for that hat. When you were walking over here... l think l saw him staring at your ass. - Shut up. - lm not kidding. Just my luck--an Amish sodomist. Go for it. What are you looking at? Damn, honey, l dont know. You ask them. Are you guys some kind of dragon queens or something? - lm sorry? - Dont even bother. Look, honey, an Amish. You people sure make a kick-ass pie. Thats some good-eating pie.

Could you leave it on? OK. OK. lts OK. OK. Hey. Hey, there. OK, l think theres... some kind of twisted fag sex ring going on here. Really?

You cant trust the... l dont even wear boxers. What is that? lts a ring. lm so fucking trashed. You are so beautiful. You dont even know it. Look at me.

Whats wrong? Wheres Troy? You hooked up with him. Oh, my God. l thought l would have been petrified... but l just dove right in there. You said you werent even into him. l dont believe this. You were so right about the thumb thing. This is great. This is just fucking sterling. Whats wrong with you? Now you can go join the fag club... get a tan, big muscles... some gorgeous boyfriend. Dont make me laugh. lm just wondering what the hell happens to me... now that youve graduated to butt-fucking. Where do l fit in? Why is it always about you? Thats bullshit. lts not always-- No, its always about you. All you can ever think about is your own fat ass! Where are you going? l need my own space right now! What are you doing? Oh, my God.

What did he do to you? He fucked me, and then he dumped me... for his wife. Oh, my God. Hes married? l always wondered how ld feel when you finally did the nasty. Part of me would be really happy for you. Then the selfish bitch was always scared shitless. Why? Because...l dont want to lose what we have. Which is what? Something sick and twisted... that we both desperately need therapy for. Look, all l know is, when lm with you... l was just about to say something really corny. lm afraid youre gonna give your love to someone else. But enough about me. Lets talk about you.
