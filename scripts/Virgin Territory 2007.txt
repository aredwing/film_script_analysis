I first became a thief. but then I discovered thieving gets your hands cut off. or your bits smashed with a hammer. or hanged... like my father. So I gave up being a thief and did the next best thing. I joined the church. Not as a priest, though it has good prospect. No. As a painter. An artist. I could do it all. Angels, devils, virgins and nuns. Painting bones on angels is not a bad way of earning a living. And I was happy. Then everything changed. Not just for me.... For everyone. The rich, the poor, everyone... This boy, Lorenzo, he always in trouble. Always pushing his luck. Lorenzo's a gambler, a winner, but his luck has run out. This time he won against the wrong person. Gerbino Della Ratta. They had this fight you see. And Gerbino's a bad loser. A really bad loser. Gerbino Della Ratta would resent losing a dirty sock in a wager. That's the kind of person he is. -Come down here and fight me. -So you can put a scar like that on my cheek? I've improved your looks, you ugly shit, but I'm far too beautiful. You're next. Into the shit, where you belong. Why is he still alive, Andreuccio? I told you, I want him dead. Lorenzo De Lamberti was not the first to have a thing for Pampinea Anastasi. Although he was the last one to admit. The richest girl in town. Pampinea is not so much spoiled... as laviously as overindulged. Poor little rich girl. But that was before the plague. Not now. Everything changed. Even for Pampinea. Lorenzo, quick! Gerbino waiting for youre at your house. He won't rest until you're dead. Get the hell out. Now! Having painted the bones on 14 angels, I was still waiting to be paid. -Did you tell him? -He's still asleep. Wait there. There. Plague. Just my luck. Looks like we're not getting paid. Go home. Your done here. Then I heard voices. Come and join us. Priest, right! They got it all! Food, money. And of course, the key to the convent. All those beautiful nuns. Rumor has it, Gerbino Della Ratta is a bit short on his equipment. You know, not much going on downstairs in the trouser department. It's funny, cause I always thought he was the biggest dick in town. Pampinea. I offer my sympathy. -Thank you. -It's a tragedy. This plague... Terrible Terrible... Tragedy What would you do now, Pampinea? I promised to marry Count Dzerzhinsky. He's on his way here from Russia to marry me. Thank you for your assistance. Pampinea. Before he died, your father asked me to protect you. -From what? -His estate. He was in debt. Massive in debt, with his business failing. To who? To who was he in debt? Business people. Merchants. But I paid them off. You? It's what's known as a secured loan. Your father borrowed money from me, to pay his debt... against the security of this house and all his other assets. All this. None of this belong to him anymore -Who does it belong to then? -Me. Unless you pay me the money he owe. You don't have to worry that Pampinea, I am here for you. Your father and I discussed this before he died, and he agreed. -Agreed to what? -That you should marry me. I'm promised to marry Count Dzerzhinsky! This is a badly arranged marriage. Your father told me before he died... He much prefer me. Pampinea, I am devoted to you. Marry me. I'm your to command. May I kiss your hand? That always been a problem isnt it. You know. Theocracy. She should've done something about about that, it doesnt cost anything, does it? Hey you! Where does this road lead? -Bet your wondering what I'm doing? -No, not really. No. -My friend. -What's the matter with him? Is he drunk? -No.... Guess. -Is he dead? Right! Good guess! "I am dead, check out.." -Please tell me, where does this road lead to? -I'm gonna tell you the answer... to this one, because you'll never guess and we'll be standing here all day. -That's what I was thinking. -This road lead to... Wait for it... the Sacred Sisters of the Bleeding Heart. The convent. What was he doing in a convent? What was he doing in a convent? We'll give you a clue. -He was working there as a... -Gardener? Right again! Very clever. -Do they need a new gardener? -Do you have special skills. That's not a trick question, he has special skills. -Like what, dying? -No. Guess. Guess! -I don't know. How the hell should I know? -Don't get dirty. -What then, what?! -Ow, together! -Come on, tell me! -He was deaf, and dumb. Deaf, therefore dumb. I told you, he had special skills. Being deaf and dumb is not a skill. It's a handicap. For him it weren't. Bye! Hello there! I bet your wondering what I... Straight from heaven. He's beautiful. Strong. Look at him. He's.... Beautiful. -Is he hurt? -I don't know. Do you think we should take off his coat to see if he broken any bones? I think we should... Just to be sure. Where should we start? Your turn. His mouth. Kiss his mouth. Sisters? Mother, He's alive. He has said nothing mother. We believe he's deaf and dumb. Can you hear? Can you.... speak? A miracle. An angel. He fell from heaven. Take him to the bathroom. Clean him. For the first time in her life.. Pampinea Anastasi feels the need for friends. Filomena! Did you tell the others? We meet them in the church. Alright you lot. Girls in front, boys step back. Quino, I didn't expect to see you here, I must say. You can say, but youre not allow to talk. No problem, I'm sure you have enough to say for everyone, for me. -This is the girl you wanted to marry? -Can't wait. I could eat her alive. My father has a house in the country. A villa. We could all go there to escape the plague. Good... lets go. My parent's dying wish was I to marry Count Dzerzhinsky. The marriage will take place at the villa. You'll all be the guest. Pampinea. This is an arranged marriage, yes? Maybe you should try it first. At least take a look. Melissa! That is an insult to Pampinea's pledge to chastity. -We're all virgins here. -Yes, but some are more virgin than others. Speak for yourself. I would rather die than relinquish my virginity before marriage. I always thought you had a thing for Lorenzo. What's this? What are you doing here all of you? Praying. We're praying for the dead. Any one of you thinking of leaving the city, could prove extremely dangerous. Go home, all of you. Like good children. I recognized these two. They're friends of Di Lamberti. Perhaps, we should take a walk. I knew I should have kept my mouth shut. What do I care? Even if he was going to kill them. Then I heard those damn noise again. Keep your mouth shut! Keep your mouth shut! Keep your mouth shut... Keep your mouth shut! Oh what the hell! I did have a big trap. You! All of you leave. Take your swords and leave the church! This is Gerbino Della Ratta. No one speaks to him like that. This is the house of God, and I speak with his voice. Who are you? I'm the servant of God. I speak with his voice. You ran across of our Lord. When did you last take your confession? The plague that walks our streets, steals our soul. Its the Armageddon. See your face again? I'll take your blood, send it to your maker. Gerbino! Is he dead? Lorenzo Di Lamberti? If I were you, I'll consider him dead I've never talked, such bollocks in all my life. Thank God for being a priest.. Is this it? I thought you'd say could get a carriage? This is Uncle Bruno. He's not very bright but he's very strong. Isnt that right Uncle Bruno? And he's a virgin. Aren't you Uncle Bruno? I am. I'm saving myself. -Who's that? -It's the priest, Father Tindero. If this to be a wedding, you'll need a priest. After hanging around in a square for a couple of hours, waiting for Pampinea. We discover she'd gone to a convent to escape from Gerbino and wait for her Russian Count. What better place to preserve her virginity than amongst other virgins? Or so she thought. -Who's that man? -He's our gardener. Sent from heaven. -He's dead and dumb. -What? He can't hear or speak a word. How sad. He looks as if he have alot to say for himself. Hear no evil, speak no evil. Come here! Now jealousy is a funny thing. It creeps up on you. Take you by surprise. Distracted, Pampinea's Russian Count have slipped from her mind. What is that? I am here. Hello. I bring gifts for you, your wife and your daughter. Soon to be my wife. You are Pampinea's father, Yes? I am Pampinea's father. No No? I am Gerbino Della Ratta, Pampinea's husband to be. Sir, there has been a mistake. Pampinea Anastasi is suppose to be married to me. Count. You don't mind me calling you a Count? You look like a big Count to me... Pampinea Anastasi soon to be my wife. You just didn't hear about it... That is a mistake. So you bring me, all the way from Novgorod to tell me, that Pampinea Anastasi... is marrying a man, who is old enough to be her father? I did not bring you here, but I suggest you leave. Florence is very bad for the health at this time of year. Gerbino Della Ratta. Della Rat...Huh? A rat is a small furry animal. Yes? Yes. Yes, I thought that much. Sir! I'm Linguino, servant to Pampinea Anastasi. She's safe and well. And no matter what you hear, is waiting for your arrival... This letter will give you instructions on how to get to her villa in the country. She'll meet you there for the wedding. Sir, you are in danger here. You want to ride straight to the villa. Be there as soon as you can. For Pampinea, I will do this. We know you cannot hear us or speak to us. But to us, you are so beautiful like an angel sent from heaven to bring us joy. And we pray, that God might restore the miracle of speech to you and your hearing. So that you can hear the birds sing and... -Get on with it! -I am! -He has no idea what you're saying. -Then you do it! We know that this morning, you met Sister Catherina in the orchards and then Sister Melissabeta in the granary. We want what you gave them. And we want it now. Come on. There to Florence, there I was, stuck on the cart. This Uncle Bruno farting more than the horse. and Miss randy-pant banging about being a virgin. Truth is, those that rattle on about it, cant wait to do it. God, there she goes again. I'm very proud of my virginity, Melissa. And so is Dioneo. The boyfriend, Dioneo. He's suffering from terminal randiness as well. Never done it in his life. Dioneo! We don't indulge in sex. Do we? Not in broad daylight, in the middle of the road, we don't. No. I say, we believe in no sex before marriage. We're happy to wait, aren't we? Forever my love. Liar. Who's that? Are they waving at us? No, I think they're waving at me. See what they want. Quick before they come! Me? Run before they come into Filomena! No, No. You go. You go. Do we want any milk or bread? They said their produce is very fresh... and we might want to sample it, back at their farm. Its too late. We can get to them. Come on. Come on! Help yourself. Fresh milk, there it is. How do you get milk out of that? City boys. Where we come from, milk come out of the jug. I bet you could do it, if you tried. Show us. This is how its done. See how its fit nicely fit into my hands? I love this thing in my hands. Don't you, Mira? Wonderful. You'd almost say a little firmer would be better. Too late, can't stop now. Take it firmly in your hands, and squeeze. Stroke up. And pull. I love this. Its coming. I can feel it. A little strong? A little faster? It's coming! Milky white, hot. Please! Yesona, let do it! Dioneo. Just what are you doing with that cow? "Yesona, let do it!?" Disgusting. Disgusting. -I told you, we wasn't there for the milk. -There's the maid. Those shou not touch! Remember? That include beasts and barns, especially ones with tits and hairy armpits. Piss off, its over! You'll never have sex with me as long as you live!. Sometime later, I heard that the cow was emotional disturbed... by these events, and never gave milk again. Poor cow. It's a sin what you just said. And the other two. Yes, your right. Its a sin. A delicious sin. The four of you in one day! You should be ashamed. I think your jealous. Huh I hope you'll drown. Get him, now! Andruccio. What's that? See that? It's fantastic. I want that! Get me that! Up your ass, ?! Are you leaving, Father? From the church... Gerbino. He was afraid of me, wasn't he? He was afraid of the cross you wear around your neck. Allow me to make a small observation. All this talk of virginity. Yes? A kissed mouth doesn't lose its freshness. like the moon, its rises new again. -Very poetic I'm sure. -Just an observation. It wasn't me that said it. What about the wedding? I'll be there. But first I had to make a pilgrimage of my own. Yesona. Yesona! Yesona, I'm here. I love you my dear. Yesona, lets take this ride into the sunset. You filthy disgusting beast! Every day I see you... I'm drawn to you. Every night I sleep... I am with you. Everyday... Every night. I think it farted up with you Filomena, that's the true of it. Well, when it comes to farting, Uncle Bruno, you should know. Dioneo... Dioneo! Stop this sulking! I'm not sulking. Please, Dioneo. Look at me. Look at me. I didn't mean to call you a filthy beast. A sweetie pear. Little honey cucumber. Please, I'm not a child, or a cucumber. But I love you. I love you, cucumber. -I love you. -It was only a dream. I would never be unfaithful to you, you know that. Its like being licked by a dog when you do that, it really is. Hey listen to me. I love you and I forgive you. Look. Your forgiven with a proper kiss. And another. And another. And another. Dioneo. Stop this now. Me? Dio, kiss me. Kiss me. My God. Whats that? What do you think it is? When we're married. Soon. You'll see. What a treasure I have for you. Give me Give me.. Give me the treasure! Give me the treasure! Please. What's happening? Dioneo! What's going on? My God! What happened? Nothing. Nothing. It may be nothing to you, Dioneo Dugalante, but its a disgrace and humiliation to me! One kiss and look what you've done! You had your hand. Get out of my loot. I did nothing of the sort. That's the trouble with you. You just don't know when to stop. Hello my little crazy flower. Good show. This way please. Melissa! I am Alessandro Felice. And I am your host. Welcome. You're not our host and we are not your guests. We are your prisoners. Show us your body. So beautiful. The world is waiting for girls like you. Have you travelled? I've been to Sienna. Sienna? Then you must come with me to Tunisia. You'll like it there. -Where is Tunisia? -Africa. -Why are you going to Africa? -What did she just say? And to work. Of course. What you mean, work? It's easy. It's relaxing work. You'll will spend most of the time on your back. -Over my dead body. -That can be always be arranged. My god... He wants to...? That is what he means isn't it? What are we gonna do? Did you see the way he looked at us? He's handsome. He's sexy. What do you mean? Look, if you want to get out of here alive, we've just have to take control. Lead these dickheads by the nose. These is what commonly known... as a Chef Palace. Sit down and be a good boy. Put these on. Youre next. I will not... I will not... relinquish.. My precious...precious... jewel. Not until my Diana... meet my Apollo... And the goddess Venus carries me... Oh please carry me. to the threshold... of my Jupiter. Who are these guys? Like...You. I have waited... longing... But still, my Jupiter has not come. I pray him to come. Yearn him to come. You, my delicious ?. You are my Jupiter. Filomena. Please don't let them take me away. I need a wee! Oh shut up, stupid fart! You have to hold on! -What happened? -It was boring. All he wanted to do was look. Made me dance around the pole without my knickers and that was it. Where did you get that? -I'm next. -Follow me, do actually as I do. Got it? Gentlemen. Gentlemen! Your captain has us to you, for your delight. For your delight! Hurray. This is the lovely Filomena. A rad beauty I'll think you'll agree. Have you ever seen such glorious breasts? Show them. -They like it! -Gentlemen, let hear it for Filomena's breasts. Now, every pussy knows that there is only one thing matters. Who get to go first... And the one to go last. Who is the biggest tomcat in town? Me, Me, Me, Me! There is only one way to do it. Off. Get them off. Let's get a look at the tackles. Come along. Come along, in a line, in a line. All boys together. Don't be shy. On the count to three, you big butch bandits. Drop those loons. One Two! Three! Wonderful... Magnificent. Behold... manhood in all its glory. God, I never seen one before! -Now, there's a whole army of them! -Let's take a closer look. Order, please, order. You, stand up straight! Let me see. I think you should swap places with him. And you with him. Better. Where is it? Oh, there is it. That's very small... and shrively. -I hope theirs not all like that? -Thanks very much. Looks like the end. Don't you, Melissa? Off you go, chop chop. Wonderful display, well done everyone. Now this is it. The moment you've all been waiting for. Who... goes first? We do, start with the biggest and work your way down. No!. The smallest... start small and work your way up. We both start in the middle, and work your way to the end. -I'm the smallest, I go first. -You want first, then last? Watch what you say, big knob! -Your asking for a thump. -Try this for size. Right, that's it. Gino! Me next. Come on Gino, Cone one. Hurry up! Having fun? What does it mean "over your dead body?". Naughty man. Now comes the news she didn't want to hear. The Count has arrived in Florence. Now Pampinea has a dilemma. How does she feels about feeling leaving Lorenzo alone with all those nuns? How to you know this? I heard him, singing in the garden. -You are certain? -Very. He has a beautiful voice. It'd just be hard to resist. Goodbye... and Thank you. The butcher's here. He brought a knife. A very sharp knife. His ready to cut off your... Please! A miracle! I can speak! Get out! Wanker. Are you human? No. I'm the spirit of this pool. An enchantress. I thought that much. And... am I now under your spell? Yes. Now that you have drunk the water. You're under my spell. Where did you come from? Before you became... an enchantress. Florence. Where are you travelling to? To a wedding. -Are you the bride? -If I were the bride... on my way to be married... Would you be the groom? Well, like you I'm also travelling to a wedding but if... by chance... you were to tell me. that your name... is Pampinea Anastasi then... my life would be complete. Because you are, without question... the most beautiful women, I have ever seen. If I'm Pampinea Anastasi, then you must be... Dimitri Vyacheslav Alexander Dzerzhinski. First son of Alexander Piotr Abramovich Dzerzhinski. From the kingdom of Novgorod and you... you are Pampinea Anastasi, soon to be my bride. Is this is not true? No. I'm an enchantress. And you have answered my call. At that special moment.... when a woman must make her gift. Of her precious jewel. A treasure all women holds dear... the greatest gift a woman can bestow to a man. Something you can't wait. You must tell no one of our meeting. Having, succeeding getting him shut out. Pampinea backtrack pass the convent... just to be certain the nuns weren't getting what she fancied for herself. Lorenzo De Lamberti. Pampinea Anastasi. What are you doing here? You know, just... enjoying the day. I've been working as a gardener, escaping the city life. A gardener? I have a strong affinity with nature. Oh. Well good, we'll see you then. Maybe. Mingino. No, Wait, Wait. -Where're you going? -On my way to be married. Yes, I heard about that. Some short, fat Russian from Novgorod? I hear you're very popular... very much in demand. You mean Gerbino Della Ratta? He's a turd. I hear you want lesson for your debt. Mingino. Enjoy your affinity with nature. Perhaps I can come with you...! To be your escort. To deliver you safely into the arms of your ? Like all good pilgrims, I've followed the path. I had arrived... Heaven. They say the Mother Superior at his convent... is a woman of unparallel lust and randiness. -Who's there? -I'm a holy Father... in search for a place of contemplation and prayer. I will take you to the holy mother. -Father. Have you any skills? -Such as? -Gardening, perhaps. -Gardening? A little. Good. All this silence you see upon, it almost if we were.... deaf and dumb. We may see many things, but we speak nothing of them in here. Understand? Silence... Deaf and dumb. And gardening. Not quite I have in mind. Would you care... for a bath? A bath!? I was in. Perfect place for a wedding. Nobody's here yet, we're the first. Lorenzo! Wait... Lorenzo. You could stay... just a little longer. Blindfold? Is that really true? You were blindfolded when you kissed her? When she kissed me You'll soon forget her, thats what I think. You'll forget her and the kiss. You, Lorenzo Lamberti... to tell the truth and all. You don't have to believe me. How can you be in love with a woman you've never seen? Simple. It was the kiss. Everything was in that one kiss. How'll you find her? This woman you never seen, locked behind convent doors? I don't know. Perhaps youre right. I mean they'll not gonna let me in that convent, thats for sure. I think its best you'll forget her, Lorenzo. I won't forget her. What if you found her? What if you found her, kissed her. And your dream dies? How will you feel? Its not to dream. Lorenzo, your memory of that precious kiss will fade, in a temptational way. You'll see. Even if I have to kiss you myself to prove it. -Sounds like a challenge? -Maybe it is. You were always the girl, every boy wanted to kiss. But? But...you were always too... Do what? Too good, too clever, too... Too beautiful. Too everything, always out of reach. Why don't you kiss me now, Lorenzo? To see if I can make you better. You mean, all the times that I wanted to kiss you, but never could? For all those times. And more. Close your eyes. Gerbino, I know it. Its him! Run Lorenzo. Please. He'll kill you for sure. Run, Run! Della Ratta! You shit. We could smell you coming. Lorenzo! Come on! You want to kill me? Do it! Come on! Come on. Give me a sword! Give me a ? to cut you! Gerbino Della Ratta! Leave him! Leave him! I will not marry you. Never! Not if you kill him! Marry him? Is that what this is about? You marrying him? Make a mistake, youre a dead man. Kill me today, you'll still be a ugly shit tomorrow. He's in trouble, Pampinea. Alot of trouble. What kind of trouble? Theft. Murder. I can believe what you said. Youre not first say it. But he's only a boy. Please. Please. What? Don't lean over. What are you doing? Please. Listen. -Come down. -Your afraid of height, aren't you? No. Just don't want you to fall in. How can I fall? -I've been playing on this well, since I was a child. -Just get down! Release Lorenzo, and you can send for the priest. Now? You'll marry me now? Yes. But if I marry you, and you do not release him. If you have blood on your hands... then you'll spend the rest of your life in a cold bed. Do you understand? I'll give you nothing of what I have to give. You have my word. I'll send for a priest. How the hell do you find a priest just like that? You'll have your balls on the block if we don't. -Hey, You! -What? Father. Where're you going? To Pampinea's house. To the wedding? How do you know we wanted a priest, when we've just been sent to get one? The word of God, travels fast. Hey, don't I know you? Your face is very familiar. Its the clothes, all priests looks the same. You must go. Leave before he changes his mind. Are you really going to marry him? Not your concern. The priest's here. Leave while you can. He must hear our confessions before the wedding. I'll go first. So, just to be clear. How many potential husbands you have right now? -Three. -Which one do you want? Lorenzo! I love Lorenzo. But you not met the Count, the one you promise to marry. You could fall in love with him. -No, only Lorenzo. -Does he love you? Yes. No. He love me but he doesn't know it yet. It's not easy being a priest. Please delay as long as you can. and I realized that... stealing other people's money was far easier than working for my own. All those killings? How many people? -I can't remember. -That's quite a list. Not to mention what you did to your father. Do I know you? Your face is familiar, I'm sure I know you. Its the clothes. All priests looks the same. To absolve yourself... from these terrible sins and hope for an eternal salvation. you must abstain from all sexual thought and all sexual deeds.. For a period of 30 days. But I'm just about to be married! How can I abstain sex for 30 days? That's... mean! and stupid. Well of course, if you do something really stupid... then you must expect to suffer so we can remain stupid in return... just to show you how stupid you were in the first place. It's called a penance. That's... really, really stupid. God works in mysterious ways. Well, I had him by the nuts... Well for sure. But how long could I squeeze, before he squeeze mine? You know Gerbino sent us along to kill you, didn't he?. I kind of guess that. Dirty business, killing. -I'd rather be a gardener. -I know just the place. Listen. We could let you go. But you must promise not to tell. Really? -I promise. -Good. That hurts. Really, really hurt. Is this the road to the villa of Pampinea Anastasi? -It's that way. -Thank you. Who are you? I am Count Dimitri Alexander Dzerzhinski...! Ah! short, fat Russian Witness, all of you. You are Gerbino Della Ratta? You know who I am. Please don't be difficult. How can I marry you if you don't answer the question? Are you Gerbino Della Ratta? I am. -You are Pampinea Anastasi? -I am, Father. And when did you both last take confession? Pampinea? I've taken confession on this day, Father. -Did you confess all your sins? -I did, Father. Gerbino Della Ratta. When did you last take confession? -You know when I last took confession. -Bad answer. "I had taken confession on this day, Father." -I had taken confession on this day. -Father. Father. Then do you both come to me, pure in body and soul. Hence I do. - I do. - I do. - Have you bathe? - What?! Pampinea? I have bathe, on this day of day which is my marriage debt. Witness all of you, this woman come to us pure, in both body and soul. Gerbino Della Ratta. Have you bathe on this day of day, that is your wedding day? - Yes. - When did you bathe? - I just told you I bathe!. - When exactly, when did you last take a bath? I have bathe! Thoroughly? All the bits and pieces, downstairs.... -In between your legs? -What? Show me your hands. -You got dirt on your nails. -Where? There. I can't marry you if you have dirty fingernails. That ridiculous... I've never heard anything so ridiculous. I can hardly say, witness all you, this man come to us, pure in body and soul. But with dirty fingernails. Now can I? You must wash your hands. The very least. -There. -Thank you. He only doing his job. Exactly. Incidentally, there is a charge for my services. This is very jolly. Pour this fine wine... A little young, perhaps fine. Fresh fruit, with a... A musty, a musty hint... A musty hint of what I can really, only describe as stale fart... rather like the combination of this couple here, before me today. Marry us now, you bastard! I declare you man and wife. There, its done. Your married. Relax, enjoy. Consummate, whatever you what really. Hey! I am Count Dimitri Viacheslav Alexandrovich Dzerzhinski. First son of Alexander Piotr Abramovich Dzerzhinski... from the kingdom of Novgorod. I am here to marry Pampinea Anastasi. I will kill any man who try to stop me. Youre too late. Pampinea Anastasi is already married. This is my wife. This is house. This is my land. I'll advise you while you still have air to breathe. This lady may be your wife. But I'm sorry to tell you, she'll about to become a widow. You piece of rat. You took 4 men who were close to my heart. You stole their lives. An now you must pay! Lorenzo! Run! -Here we go? -I don't know. -You go that way, I go this way. -Who are you? Lorenzo Lamberti. The robber on the road. Yes! I am Count Dimitri Alexander... I know, I know. First son! Only son. Nine sisters. Gerbino Della Ratta. Get her and bring her to me. Kill them and throw them down to me. Hello. Tell me... Are you ready to die? You dropped your little sword. Pick it up. Fight me. Fight me or I'll kill you anyway. Wait. We have unfinished business. Is that not right, Gerbino? You want to kill me? Why don't you come up here and join me? I'm sorry my friend. I've sworned to kill this man. You kill him before I kill him, I may have to kill you. Here, let this decide. Alright, if you want. Why not join him. I'll fight him. But don't step in. I may step in. I may step out. I may even decide to have a little dance with you. Do not worry my friend. If he kills you, I'll kill him, either way. You're going to die. Do you need help getting up? Kill him... Kill him! Put your sword into his heart! Still a gambler, Gerbino. Want to make a bet? Go that way, youre dead. Come this way to me, dead. Go that way... But who knows? Going down. Shit! Friend. Take my advice. Do not drink water from this well. Sorry. -So that one's Lorenzo? -Yes. By the way I'm not really a priest. So you're already married.
