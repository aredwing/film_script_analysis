You're either a doctor or a lawyer. Pilot? Shit! Cheers! And you? What's your name? Mary Mary? Bloody Mary Bloody Mary? What do you do? Make a guess. What will I get... if I guess it right? Just guess. Your skin is good and your makeup is nice. Beautician. Am I right? Oh my God! Are you a psychic? Something like that. Cheers! Any prize? Take it off... You first. Come on! I can't... Come on... Come on... Hurry up... Come on... Coming... You are so unprofessional, and such an idiot! I don't care. You have to take care of it! Hello? How come you are not at the office? Boss? It's Sunday, why should I be at the office? You love to officiate at weddings, there's one today. I can't make it, you do it for me. Hi, is this Lam and Leung's wedding? They are rehearsing, you can't go in. I'm the civil celebrant... from UP and DUP law firm. Wait... You are the celebrant? Come... come with me... You are late for 15 minutes. If my boss knows that, you'll be killed. Please show me... I'll lead you to the backstage. Then, wait for my cue, Ok. And switch off your cell phone. Sure... If not, my boss will fine you for that. Okay, come with me. Alright. Second rehearsal will begin in 10 minutes. How many times do I have to remind you of the cakes? Where are they? This client is so big. We cannot afford to lose him. Okay, be serious. What happen? Did the flowers run away by themselves? Oh, they're back? You guys started 8 am this morning. How can you still have so many mistakes? Where's Terry, the groom? Terry needs to watch the second rehearsal. Terry! Terry! Miss Yan, here's Terry. Terry! Let me show you... your route during the ceremony, okay? Have a seat. Okay, everybody get ready. House light down. Spot light one up. Moon go. Thanks! Thanks for coming! Cut! Flora, I only asked you to stand in for the bride. You are NOT the bride. Be serious. And the moon, too centre. A bit to the left... Left... Stop. That's it. So it doesn't block the groom. Terry, you then go down the stage. And fetch the bride. Then come over here hand in hand. And look back together... Here comes the celebrant! Where's the celebrant? Celebrant! Coming... Mary? How come it's you? Aren't you a pilot? You also said you're a beautician. What? What? Anyone will do, except him. Yan, we have no substitute. Everyone is gone, except him. The crash! Then you come yourself. I'm in China, looking for a new partner. Sorry. You talk to him. Boss? Fung, you deal with her. Don't call me no matter what happens, bye. Hey... He hung up. Your boss owes me 30 times. He ran away, you have to pay for him. Do you count the 3 times from last night? I mean you have to be the celebrant 30 times for my company. And... Nothing ever happened last night, okay? What did I do wrong? Stop crying, men are like that nowadays. Your eyes are swollen, it's not worth it! Silly girl. Bullying her again? I'm helping her. Don't listen to those nonsense. Red wine please. I heard that you've got a new staff. That fast? Who told you that? He's also a very handsome guy. Did you do 'body check' on him? Are you nuts? He's bald with a big tummy. I don't believe it. Yan would never... hire a staff that's bald with a big tummy. Oh well... save the best for yourself. We understand. Cut it out. I'm starving, let's order. Guess who came to my office today? Vincent Wong, Chillie Sze's husband. You organized their wedding last summer. Let me guess, he came to your office... Either to get a will or file for divorce. Miss Yan, your mouth really stinks! He filed for divorce. You don't remember what Miss Yan's secret is about? She likes to secretly curse her clients right... when the bride and the groom... are exchanging wedding rings. "See how long your marriage would last" That's the way it is. Marriage is like baking bread... When it bakes for too long, it'll be burnt. You're quite punctual. Let me help you. Thanks. This is your seat. Miss Yan said you can stay here until you're done with 30 times. Treat this as your own office. Where are the other colleagues? They all went to serve a big client. It's Mr. Chiu. Hi there, Mr. Chiu. Hello... Thanks for coming! Hello. Hi! Your daughter? She's my fiancee... Jessica Nice to meet you! It's so lovely to meet you! OK, let's go... Let's go and check it out, okay? Bring them to have a look. This way. Mr. Chiu, this way, please. You don't have to be so honest, Sorry... do you? Let's go. Mr. Chiu, our office is about 50,000 square feet. Where do you want to take a look first? Let's look at wedding gowns! Gowns! Gowns... Oh, sure. Wedding gowns. Take a deep breath! Harder! Come on! Inhale... Inhale! Miss, why don't you choose another dress. I've been on diet for 2 months... Just to fit into this gown! You want to look good, right? Raise your hands when I count to 3. One, two, three... Hands up! It's done! Congratulations! You look gorgeous! Miss, are you alright? Miss... Are you alright? What's up? She passed out! Another one? Shit! Mr. Chiu is coming. How is it? Push her aside... And cover her up. Mr. Chiu, here is our collection for the bride. As you are our prestigious clients... Look at this. We sure can contact Vera Wang... to tailormake a new gown for you. Vera Wang? I love her, that's awesome. Here is our studio. This is a 19th century palatial set. Next to it is a garden set. With real flowers and grasses. It's European style on this side, and we've got more... A blue set. It's our company's special effects studio. What's so special? The background is blue... but after CG retouch... you can even have the couple standing in a champagne glass. We also have Chinese wedding cakes. We can make whatever design you like. Just like these. Our latest service: Love movie. You can turn yourself into... the main characters of your favorite movies And have a unique memory. If you wanna record your own love song, no problem. Here is our recording studio. Mr. Chiu, just tell us... what you want, and you'll for sure get fulfilled. We do have a special request. You can trust our professionalism. Jessica wants... to have a special guest in the wedding. Sure, we have a special team for that. Not a problem. Who is it? Her name is... Ga... ga Ga... ga? Who is she? Opera singer? Lady Gaga! Lady Gaga! Lady Gaga! Po... My poker face... My my my poker face... Well, Mr. Chiu, what about... Leon Lai or Andy Lau? Shit! Twins are good too. No way! I want Lady Gaga! Lady Gaga Gaga! Let me know if you've got any news. We're leaving. Mr. Chiu... Mr. Chiu... Check for me... who is the agent of Lady Gaga? Okay. Book a ticket to the States for me. But she's having her world tour concert now. Then go check where she is now. Okay. She did a concert in Macau, check who's the organizer. Alright. Also, has she been to Hong Kong or not. Yes, she came here last month. What did you say? She came here last month. What for? To see my mom. It's not funny at all. I mean it, she and my mom are very close. Look. She had a foot massage at my mom's parlor. Got addicted right away. Now she often visits my mom. I want to see your mom. You won't want to see my mom. I really do! "Cha's Foot Massage" Miss Yan, I wanna help you. But this Lady Gaga... She would come and go without advance notice. And once she's here, she wants total privacy. Auntie... Maybe you can give Lady Gaga's... number to me. That's unethical. I won't disclose my client's number. Mom. Just cry out loud, you'll feel great. Louder! Louder! Stop laughing! Have you guys slept together? No. No. Then no need to help you. We did, auntie. Just once, I'm sorry. Alright! You have guts, I'll help you. Hello, Lady Gaga! I am Lady Mama. As you sign on this certificate with my witness, you two will be a lawful couple. I, Chiu Shan do take Jessica to be my lawful wedded wife. I Jessica do take Chiu Shan to be my lawful wedded husband. Ladies and gentleman... Lights down. Lady Gaga! Piano, go. Amazing! It's so wonderful. Even Lady Gaga was willing to come to perform in this wedding. Amazing. It's my pleasure to interview this wedding planner... Miss Yan. It's the way I am, I love to meet challenges. Do you believe that marriage is a lifetime promise? Of course I do. But I saw on your friend's blog, that you actually would feel great if you know someone has a divorce. Right? That's just a joke... don't believe that. My friends like to crack jokes on me. Really? It doesn't seem to be a joke. Your quote is: Marriage is like bread baking... When it's just done, it's fresh and yummy. But when it bakes for too long, it'll be burnt. Don't worry. We're just chitchatting. For all the weddings that you've organized Which one do you think is 'perfect'? Would it be the one that... you organized for yourself... before getting into this business? Oh shit! And unfortunately, the groom didn't show up at the end. Do you think it's your problem or the groom's? Well, in fact... I know it's really hard to explain. Anyway... although Miss Yan has failed on her marriage She does have a very successful career. It's really hard to have both. So we should have deep sympathy for her. What did you say? Thank you, Miss Yan. Thanks for being interviewed. Director. You promised not to talk about personal stuff, what the hell! I'm sorry. You look nice on camera. Ask me! What? What do I think about the host. What do you think about the host? Fuck her... Hello! Byebye! Byebye! Nice to meet you. Byebye! Thanks. See you next time, byebye! Bye! Ask again! What? Am I mad? Are you mad? Are you nuts? Nonsense! That's it. No, one more. What is it then? Who the hell passed her my secret? Who the hell passed her your secret? I also wanna know, if I know who did that... If he's a man, I'd chop him up! If she's a woman, I'd stuff her up with fat. Then cut open her belly and pull it out... And stuff her up, and pull it out... again! Hey, where are you going? Going home. No, you go drink with me! I should have better answers just now. I shouldn't have lost to that bitch. Ask again. Well... Your boyfriend didn't show up, you think it's your problem or his? In fact... it's my problem. I couldn't resist him. I just couldn't. I'd go wherever he asks me to go. If he said, go east! You know what I'll do? Guess you wouldn't go west. Yeah, more obedient than a dog. There're a few times I really couldn't take it anymore. So I told him we'd break up. This one time... I was so mad that I flew to Japan. Then I called him and told him... not to look for me anymore. He ignored me. He said no way. Do you know why? Why? I looked back, he was right behind me. He's standing right outside in the snow! Jesus, don't you think it's so sweet? I then ran over and gave him a big hug. It's like in a movie. Super touching, right? Well, I would have done the same thing. It's just okay. He keeps giving me surprises. I spent all my effort to organize the most perfect wedding for us. It's beautiful, everything in the party... were ordered from overseas, it's spectacular. My friends were all so happy for me. But he didn't show up. Amazing? He didn't come. What a shithead. You know him? How can you say he's a shithead? No. I feel sorry for you. I'm surprised that you still couldn't let go. What did you say? I'm surprised that you couldn't forget about him. What do you mean? I can't even remember his number. Come on, don't worry about it. Who cares about his number? Hey! Can you handle it? That's it. Drink it. Hey, you asked me to pour it. Drink. Almost there. OK Come on, one, two, three. Go. Where's the key? Lean over here. Where's the key? This one? It doesn't work. Anybody home? Who is it? What's up? Hi Hi Beat him up for me. What? Beat him up. You don't do it? I'll do it. Why didn't you come? Why didn't you come? I'm asking you! You asked me to marry you! Do you know how long have I waited there? Do you know how they looked at me? Why didn't you come? Sorry... Why didn't you come... I saw a pair of red shoes yesterday. It's so beautiful, it's on sale. Is it for you or for me? Of course it's for me. Shit! I've been looking for red shoes... What? Is she dead? She's still breathing. And still has heart beats. Do we need to call an ambulance? What's going on? I remember putting her on the sofa. What should we do? Wake her up. No... don't wake her up. Otherwise we'll be yelled at. Better pretend that we don't know anything. Go... This one suits me well. You know this one is deadstock! This colour... Sorry... Yan! Is this bag nice? OK Did you have sex last night? You are nuts! Your hair is messy and you got big eye bags. Your skin is dry and super pale. There're only 2 reasons for that. One, worked overnight. Two, made love overnight. Worked overnight. It's not very likely. I didn't see you yelling at your staff on the phone. And you're not excited to see the new bags. Come on, tell the truth. As a lawyer... This is the response of a guilty client. I really don't know. How could you not know? We won't take that as an answer. Sure. There's only one condition that you would forget what happened last night. A bottle of Lafite 1995... At least two bottles of white wine... And a smell of champagne too. You must be extremely lustful last night. Give me a break. I also wanna know how lustful I was. I forgot everything as I woke up. What a waste. Just ask yourself: When you woke up this morning... did you feel sore all over your body? Yes. Then ask yourself: When you woke up this morning... did you feel amazingly satisfied... and filled with joy? Yes. Last question, did you find any hickey... around here? Shit. Congratulations! Double blessings! From your response, you had sex last night. And you are serious about this person. Really? Case closed. Who is it? Just tell us... You looked for me? Come over here. Where have you been? I went to lunch. With whom? Colleague. Which one? Watchman? I had lunch with Flora. You're my staff. I have to tell you clearly. I don't permit workplace affair in my company. OK? But having lunch with colleagues... it's my right, boss. I'm not talking about her. Why did you bring me back to the office when I was drunk last night? Look what you did to me. Look. Look... Here and here... look. No, I didn't. You were drunk last night, I wanted to bring you home. But the address you told me is not your home. A guy opened the door. And when you saw him, you told me to beat him up. I didn't, then you did it yourself. Maybe you hurt yourself like that? Why are you still here? You didn't ask me to leave. Remember this, nothing happened last night. Nothing happened again? You mean I have two blank nights since I met you? I'm leaving then. By the way... You drank too much last night. To ease your hangover. Drink it, I'm leaving. Everybody, be serious. Mr. Yeung is arriving soon. Where's the brazier? I want to... It's very expensive. I know, here it is... Where should I put it? Put it up at the stage. Go... He's a lawyer. Lawyer the hell. Since he's got nothing to do at the office, Let him be our helper. By the way, those handsome guys are here. Hi, there! Are you friends of Louis? Yeah. I'm the wedding planner, Yan. Do you mind singing me... the song that you're going to perform? Okay. Thanks, ready... Miss Yan, Mr. Yeung is here. Excuse me... Mr. Yeung is here, Let's take a break first, okay? Okay. Thanks. How are you, Mr. And Mrs. Yeung? Who are they? They're friends of Louis, this way please. Louis wants the ceremony to begin... with a warm and intimate feeling. No, it has to be grand and extravagant... A big live orchestra suits better. No problem, Mr. Yeung. I'd tell them to leave then. What kind of sound system you're using? Would it make my voice sound better? Don't worry, Mr. Yeung. We're using Wharfedale. Your voice will unite beautifully with the music... and the outcome will be perfect. I've prepared 3 songs only, would that be enough? In case... the guests request me to encore, what should I do? Don't worry about it, Mr. Yeung. In our karaoke system... We have Chinese opera, musical... everything. The collection is big enough to have a concert. It's done. Mr. Yeung, this is our celebrant for the ceremony. Mr. Fung. Mr. Yeung. Congratulations, Mr. Yeung. Not me getting married. It's my son, Louis. Sorry. Louis Come over here. Come and say hello. Congratulations, Mr. Yeung. Thank you. Mr. Yeung. Let me go through the rundown with you. Let's go over here. As mentioned before, we'd be using the Olympic theme. Before the ceremony begins, the Olympic athletes... will pass the torch one by one... to the stage. Then it will be passed to you and Mrs. Yeung. At this time, both of you will light up the brazier of love. Representing the burning love of the couple... And the ceremony will begin. Good! Very good! Mr. And Mrs. Yeung. Let's take a look at the decoration over there? Alright. This way, please. Excuse me. We've got some changes in the rundown. So your part will be cancelled. You guys may leave now. Do we need to tell Louis about this? No, I'll tell him for you. Thanks, everybody. Thank you. Byebye. What's up? Are you really cancelling this part? Yes, Mr. Yeung wants it to be grand. Seems like it's his father's wedding though. No difference. His only son is getting married, it's really a big deal. But his father is... making all the decisions. The groom is not happy. I know. You knew that? Why didn't you ask the groom for his comments? His father didn't care to ask him. Who am I to ask him? Okay, even if I ask, what would his answer be? If I were him, I'd cancel everything. That's the point. If everything is cancelled, what can we charge them? I'm just a wedding planner. Not a charity worker. My job is to do a good show. OK? That's your main problem. You only treat a wedding as a show. How should it be? Do it with heart. You mean I'm not doing with heart? I really didn't feel it. Look at this part... Copy from the charity show. And this... Copy from the Olympic? And the fireworks? It's not memorial day. None is your idea. It's all about money, where's the heart? Let me tell you, I'm the best wedding planner. All the weddings I do are perfect. Who are you to criticize me? I sincerely bless every couple that I witnessed. And you? You curse them during their weddings. It's all because of your past... Forget it. What about the past? Nothing. What? Nothing. Because of what? Nothing. Because I got dumped, right? And now I curse on other couples, right? I'm so damn mean. I'm worth being dumped, right? Sorry, you'd better find another celebrant. So, any regret? No. No? No chance of having sex with her anymore. I never said I wanna have sex with her. That's even worse, you must have serious feelings for her. What do you like about her? When did I say I like her? If you don't like her, why do you care about her so much. You're not serious? Miss Yan. Fung, meet me at the Cyberport park in an hour. Okay. I got it... you're not serious. Hurry up, go... Miss Yan, where should I put the flowers? Put it at the back. Okay. What are you doing? You are late again. Is Louis' wedding supposed to be tonight? Presiding words, go get ready. Louis and Vivian Though your wedding doesn't have any religious rituals. Today, with the beautiful sky... and grasslands as witness... as you sign on this certificate, you two will become a lawful couple. Here, I'd like to thank Miss Yan... For arranging this green wedding for us. She made our dream comes true. House light down. Spot light up. Welcome everybody. Thanks for coming to our wedding. But, I'm sorry... My wife and I... have already left for Vienna for our honeymoon. Daddy. I still remember when I was in Form 2... I skipped classes one day. When I was back, you asked me where I went. I could never lie to you. So, I told you... honestly... That I went to watch a porn movie. At that time, I was so scared. I scared that you'd jump over and slap me. But you didn't, you patted my shoulder and said... You're a big boy now. Daddy, you are right. I'm a big boy now. I do want to have my own decision on many things. In the future... I hope it's going to be... me and Vivian taking care of you... Daddy, mommy, I love you. Sorry, Mr. Yeung. I didn't do the wedding the way you expected. I'm giving you back this cheque. It's 3 million. Actually, I should thank you. Well, do I still have my 3 songs? Yes, of course you do. Music! Music! "I fall into the web of love." "And you look at me from outside." "You won't let me out." "Hatred." "Love" "Both agitate my heart." "The trap of love..." "I cannot escape." Excuse me, have you seen Miss Yan? Well... I think she is over there. I was wondering where you are. You sneaked out to have a drink. Your foot is sore? Come on. Put your feet inside. What the heck? Come on. How's that? Feels better? More relieved? You want to say something to me? Like what? Oh... I heard that... In fact, you don't have to thank me. I did not. It's okay, I got it. Let me reward you. What are you doing? What do you want? Put it here. What are you doing? No. It's alright, everyone's left already. Come on. No. You're so lucky to get a massage from me. How's that? Hey... Am I better or my mom's better? By the way... Why is your mom so sure that we slept together? Anybody would know. Why? Watch this. You screamed like this, and I was looking at you this way, everyone would have known, right? Try again. No. That's enough... You'll feel better. No... it's hurts. How about a different spot. Do you always massage for your girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend. What a lie. I really don't. What kind of woman do you like? Me? For me, the most important is... Heart? No. Boobs. Cockroaches have boobs, too. Not 36D? They wouldn't have that. How can you drive if you keep drinking? That's why I didn't let you drink. You have a driver's license, right? Then tell me where you live before you get drunk. BelAir. Are you sure? Will there be a guy opening the door again? You go to hell! It's not my fault, how could I catch it? What? Pick it? I'll do it myself. Stop that, you wouldn't be able to wear it anyway. I don't want to walk barefooted. OK... come... I'll carry you. On your back? Yeah. You strong enough? You don't have 36D, Wouldn't be too heavy. Okay. What are you doing? Get ready to jump. Otherwise, how can I get on you? Alright then... Oh, it hurts... How come you're so heavy? You are... How can you be so heavy... the weak one. Even without 36D? It hurts... Wait, did you say I'm weak? You are. Hey, I was strong enough... for you that night, right? Don't you remember? I'm super strong. Say it, say that I'm strong. Calm down. I'm really strong though. Stop that... Say it... Strong... Very strong... Thanks for your shoe. You're welcome. Try not to wear high heels in the future. It's not good for your feet. Good night. Wait... Didn't you say workplace affair is not allowed? NO for fooling around, YES if it's serious. Smells good... When did you cook it? Just now. It doesn't take much to cook a chicken. Weren't you in bed with me? During your first break, I put the marinated chicken into the pot. During your second break, I put honey on the chicken. During your third break, it's ready to eat. So, if I took too long of a break, it'd be overdone? Well, even if it's overdone, you got to eat it. Try it. It's a big piece. Hold on... What's up? Hold it. Hold it? Like this. What? Look here... Your hands are so greasy. I have to remember this moment... I'll do it myself... You do look nice without makeup. Try it, is it overdone? It's good. By the way... Have your ex tried your chicken before? Well, I have done a lot of things for him... learn cooking and other stuff... But he didn't even know. Really? Yeah. Then... were you such a tough girl... when you were with him? I wasn't really tough before. I was the opposite. When I first met him, I was too dependent. I depended on him in every way. He really has missed out a lot. When I see him next time, I'd go up to him... and say... Have you tried Yan's chicken? I have, it's super delicious. You're so funny I do have a sense of humor. You're so silly. Hurry up, finish your food and go to bed. No... Why not? This time of the night... aside from eating... What would you like to do? Let's go... Come on. Hurry up. Hello, good morning! Good morning! Are you tired from last night? No. Not at all. Great, don't work too hard. Flora Have you had breakfast yet? Yes. You're so great. OK. Thank you! Are you tired from last night? Super tired! Cappuccino! Good morning, everybody! First, I'd like to thank all of you. The wedding last night was perfect! 100% But, we shouldn't be satisfied with 100%. Of course not. We should... target to score 500%. Let's talk about Mr. Chan's wedding. Mr. Chan has found Nancy from Super Wedding to arrange the wedding. What? Who? Nancy What the fuck! Nancy used to be my staff. I fired her. She stole my client? Didn't I close the deal last week. I didn't pay attention for a few days, and everything is gone. Are you guys stupid or what? Call him now! Super Wedding is charging 20% less. And Everything has been done. Too low for us. You said no discount for anyone. So he... Yeah, we asked you before. So he changed his mind. What did you say? I said, I did ask you before. Well, that's right. In fact... it's very simple. Flora Huh? Come here, take my seat. Come on. Yeah, sit here. Sit down first. What do you see from here? I see everybody. How do they look? Disappointed? Yes. Come on, we don't have to be disappointed. Life is full of hope. Maybe, Mr. Chan would get divorce tomorrow. And he'll get married again. Then we can get back our business. We have to get up from where we fell down, okay? Life is filled with hope. Yeah! Yeah... Yeah! Yeah! Miss Yan. I don't know any other celebrity besides Lady Gaga. Oh auntie, it's not that. I came here to thank you for helping me last time. This is my little gift, please take it. You don't have to, thanks. Have a seat. Auntie... Fung told me that when he was eight... you took him out to get roast pork, and never went home to your husband. Why? What else did he tell you? That's it. Well, the reason I left Fung's dad... it's not because he's unfaithful. It's because he's too boring, I just couldn't take it. After I left with Fung, Fung kept wanting to go home for his dad. So, I promised him 3 things so as to stop him. First, I bought him his favorite roast pork rice. Second, I bought him a bicycle. Third, I promised him I'll find him a good wife. So I have been telling him to try everything. And don't be a bore like his dad. You know, if a woman gets bored, she' II leave. I don't want him to be dumped by woman. You understand, right. Are you going out with him? Try it out. It's no big deal to try. But it might be tough on you. Cos Fung is still young, you know what I mean. "Charity Auction for Haiti by Worldacclaimed Photographers." Sorry... Thanks for coming. Sorry I'm late, there's a delay in the previous wedding. No problem, we are so grateful... to have you. It's for charity. Last time you were great presiding our wedding. My wife wants you back. Thanks. Need rehearsal? Or meet the photographer first? He's not here yet. We're about to begin. Let's go to backstage first. OK. This way. Welcome all for... coming to the press conference of the charity auction for Haiti. Worldacclaimed Photographers from 10 different countries would donate their masterpieces for the auction. Now, let me introduce to you, the famous local photographer... Mr. Cheng Wing Hong. Mr. Cheng Wing Hong... is the classic successful story of Hong Kong. He's been suffering from autism since he was ten. He failed in all his subjects. Even his parents were going to give up on him. But he did not give up on himself. With a singlelens reflex camera given to him by his grandpa, he learnt photography by himself. Today, he is the foremost photographer of our time. This piece that he's donated is called... "Diving" The minimum bid is... five million dollars. Cheng, please give us a speech. When I knew about the earthquake in Haiti my life... had an inexplicable change. I knew I had to do something. Although I can't save the dead, I can save the alive. Victims of Haiti: Don't be scared. Don't get panic and never give up. Thank you. Have Yan seen this picture before? That day... the weather was great. We went diving together. We were deep in the water... and we took this picture together. You look familiar, have we met before? Cheng, can we take a picture of you? Please look here. Thanks. Sir, please get out of the way. You're still blocking. Thank you. Please look here. Let's go in. So beautiful! This is the "Perfect Wedding" ring... that Yan designed three years ago. You got it made? So beautiful! What is so special about the design? Look carefully. Look at the base. The design is like the rose petals. This "Perfect Wedding" ring is very meaningful. It symbolizes that every relationship... has it's own extraordinary journey. Well, frankly, I've never thought Yan could be so romantic. Anyway... We were unable to make it in time for her last wedding, And now that it's finally made. I wish that when she find her Mr. Right, I could give it to her. Dodo, you are so generous. What? Who said I would give her on my own? It's a big gift, we should chip in together. What? There's a movie called "Peacock King". Really? It's a great story. Is it from a comic? With Gloria Yip... She's the leading actress. Not porn movie though? Go to hell! Miss Yan! Sorry, I'm late. Where should we eat? You decide. What's wrong? What's wrong? We could only hold hands when no one is around. Am I so disgraceful to you? No, I was just scared. Scared of what? I haven't been... Someone calling Yan? Yeah, I was shocked. Okay, let me hold you. Master, be careful. Let me hold you tight. What do you like to eat? Mongolian cuisine. What a coincidence? You're shopping by yourself? I was having a meeting. Colleague. Colleague? Hi. Hi. You sit here. Okay. You mind me sitting next to you? I want to sit with him, too. Sorry, next time. Fung, what would you like to drink? You mind me calling you Fung? Of course not, orange juice is fine. Orange juice? Grape juice is better. Let me order for you. Give me a bottle of Lafite 82. That wine is so dry, it suits me... but doesn't suit Yan. Isn't he the one that caused you lost your memory last time? You're nuts, of course... not. I broke up with that one long ago. What a waste. I don't agree. That kind of guy only thinks with his penis, should be dumped long time ago. What? What does that mean? Silly girl, we won't bring you along next time. Fung, do you have a girlfriend? Yes. Get along well? Need some advice? She's nice. How nice? She cooks chicken for me. And she would hold my hands at times. Are you really that innocent? If just holding hands... Then I'm your girlfriend now. Honey, where's your phone? Lend me. Okay. This is my number. Do you have a Facebook account? Add me. Do you have a Facebook account? Come on Yan, can't we exchange our numbers? I want it, too. Sorry, older women are more aggressive. It's okay. Look, he's so cute. Are you shy? You are blushing. Excuse me, I need to take a call. Yan. Who's that? Colleague. We just had a meeting together. You're lying. Didn't you say he's bald with big tummy? That one resigned long ago. It's okay... this one is good. Smells like a baby! Please, stop it. What were you doing just now? All those touching and caressing... I'm so embarrassed... Super embarrassed, got it? Really? Yeah, he's just my colleague. I'm on Yan's side this time. Do you remember my friend, Judy, who has a boyfriend 5 years younger than her? Yan was so mean. She said Judy must have adopted him from the orphanage. I'm already mean but she's even worse. Then, everything is cool. Since he's not yours. I'll give him a "body check" later. Stop fooling around. That's enough, okay? I'll answer for Yan. No problem, be my guest. Great! About the "body check"... You first or me? Of course it's me. Why? I asked for it first. I want it, too. Get in the queue. Gosh, please stop crying. Your make up is ruined. Stop crying. There's always a new day. There're guys everywhere, I'll introduce you. I don't want your guys. Look, here comes another guy. Fung, what did I do wrong? Why did he treat me like that? You're stupid. You knew it wouldn't work from the start, but you barged into it. Blame yourself. Stupid! Stop scolding her, she's sad enough. Is that he'd only hold your hands when no one's around? When his friends made fun of you, did he help you out? Did he? He didn't, that's it. So, you know how much he loves you. You just didn't want to face it. He knew that you're heartbroken, did he call you? Did he? He didn't! "Yan" Even if he does, you shouldn't take the call. You should switch off your phone. And let him know that you'll have a great life... even without him! Will I? Trust me, you will! Let's go for dinner, my treat! Do you have something to say? Go ahead. I'm listening. Let's forget anything happened between us. What did you say? Let's break up. Why? I'm not suitable for you. I'm older than you. We don't think the same way. I've never thought about that. You wouldn't think about it now, but... you'll think about it in the future. Before I came here, my plan was to come say sorry and cheer you up. But after waiting for three hours, I started to think... I'm already over thirty, how am I going to... cheer you up? You understand? You draw me a coffee lid everyday, I'm so touched. It's so sweet. But at the same time, I'm scared. I'm scared that one day you wouldn't draw me anymore. You would leave me... and I can't take that anymore. Let's break up, okay? No way. No matter what, I'm not gonna break up with you. Yes, I was so upset just now. But when I saw you standing here... my anger was totally gone. You like me drawing you coffee lid, right? I'll draw you whatever you like, everyday, till I die, what do you think? That doesn't work. What if I passed away first? That'll be fine. Cos if I passed away first, no one would draw for you. You are right. Hold it! Why? Let's take a picture. Huh? It's our first fight. Come on. Okay, let me post it on my Facebook. Are you serious? Aren't you scared your friends would see that? No. I plan to go to work with you hand in hand tomorrow. So that everyone would know we're together. It'd be great. Right? Wait... What? You just broke up with me, and you planned all these... Were you testing me? Or fooling me? No, I was very sincere... I was very scared myself. Really? I was taking it on a bet. If you say yes, I'd be doomed. I was so worried, man. I was shocked by you. Nothing. Okay, fingers intertwined. Okay. No, this way. How'll they react when they see hand in hand? I don't care. I have to let them know that you're mine. Come in. Don't be scared. Why did he show up so suddenly? I think he must have watched the interview. I guess they might be reconciled for a while. I think so, too. Hey. This is the book you've been looking for. I saw it in a bookstore this morning, so I bought it for you. Thanks for supporting me last night. Thank you. Do you think they will reconcile? That night you came to my place and hit me. Well done. Sorry, I was drunk that night and I... It's okay... My mind is much clear now. Ever since that night, a voice keep lingering in my mind. Bodhgaya What? Bodhgaya I know that I've really hurt you. In fact, these few years... it's been hard for me to face myself. Last year... I declined all my jobs. I just wanted to go to a faraway place. I went to Tibet. There I met the Karmapa. He told me that... I had hurt my beloved woman. My tears kept running down my face... Then the Karmapa said to me, Bodhgaya Your beloved one will come back... to awake you. Please give me a chance... to make up for the mistake I've made. In fact... I still want to marry you. The Karmapa will be on this cruise... to help the destined ones. Next week, it will set out from Hong Kong. I want to bring you to see him. What's up? Everything okay? Okay. That's good. Come... Come on, let's go to work. Let's go to work. What are you doing? What am I doing? You forgot what you said? Going to work hand in hand. Who do you think I am? Are you crazy? Or you think I'm crazy? That's not what I mean. You treat me like your little puppy. Ask me to come or go as you like. We're not holding hands, right? Okay, that means I'm not 'the one'. You should have told me earlier. Goodbye! Hey... What? Nothing happened between us. Got it, boss! "Looking up, twinkling stars filled up the sky." "Looking back, unfamiliar faces surrounding me." "Looking down, I could only see my feet standing there." "Looking for you, yet cannot see where you are." Son, don't be so upset, I have good news. I got a fortune stick of love for you this morning. It's an excellent one. What's bothering you? You're so smart and your qualification is so high. "The two dots gradually disappear in the dark." "The two lines never find the crossing point." "Our two shoulders miss each other in the wind." "A split second, we could have kissed each other." HI! Mom, what are you doing? Since you're so depressed, I asked her to come cheer you up. You don't like it? It's okay. I'll ask her to leave. It's lucky that I've got spare keys. It's so dark. Let's search inside. Open the blinds. It's so dark... and clothes every where. Did she just change in the living room? She's not in her room. Yan is here. Yan! Yan! Are you not feeling well? Why are you sleeping here? Why didn't you go to work or take any calls. Your mouth stinks, get brushed first. Shit! Your skin is so bad. You haven't done skin caring for days? Have a shower first. You got to have a mask. Come on, have a shower. You will be freshened up. Let me close the curtain. I've booked the "Indulge" room for 2 hours. Knock on the door if there's anything. OK. Yan, we know what's your worry. Kelvin has hurt you before. But it's long time ago. A woman has to get married at least once in her lifetime. And the chance would never come back if you miss it. You have to grasp it while it's there. It's not as simple as you think. Is there somebody else? Who is it? Oh, the handsome guy at the caf. No wonder he didn't add me on Facebook. I've made an appointment for facial at 2:30 pm. So we only have 25 minutes to decide... who Yan should be with. I go first. I think Yan should go back to Kelvin. Okay, dismiss. You are like that every time. You just won't let us talk... nor do you care about our feelings. OK, your turn. Well, I think Kelvin... is so talented. But Fung is... younger. It's really hard to choose. What kind of double talk is that. Yan, as a partner to a successful woman like you, I think Kelvin is okay. No way he's okay. He has hurt Yan so badly, it's not okay. I'd choose Fung instead. He's handsome and trendy. And most important is: He's young. Don't mention the word "young", it's too sensitive. OK. Remember the night you stood me up? I was in the bar by myself. I saw a guy... reading a book at the bar. He's so enthralled by it. The way he's reading the book is so charming. Then I remembered Mimi said... she met a doctor in a bar. Who? Why didn't I know that? It's off topic. That night I finished a bottle of wine and I was a bit drunk. I felt that there's a force pushing me towards him. Then I started chatting with him. Hi. Hi. And our wonderful journey began. He brought me back the feeling of being a real woman. And not only I got it once, I got it three times. You are my best friends. You should know that among us... I'm the one who is most keen on getting married, and having kids. I hate to be a tough career woman. With Kelvin, I have to force myself to be at his level. It's pathetic. But with Fung... I can be myself again. Come on... After I met him, I realize that for the past 3 years... no matter how successful I was I was just... a woman without any feelings. What next? Well, we can dismiss. Yan made her decision, you can go for your facial. Wait. She has made her decision. But how to reconcile with Fung is the point. Coco, please cancel my booking, thanks. Okay, let's start the real meeting. He's back, where are you guys? Happy birthday! Thank you! Me, Wing and others will throw you a party. Really? You gotta come. Okay. Yan. First of all, is everyone present? Anyone on leave? No. Very good! In 15 minutes, I want everyone in the office knows that Fung is your man. Then, within an hour, I want everyone in Hong Kong see this... on Facebook and Twitter. OK? Is camera ready? Ready. I will capture this historical moment. Good! When will be the kiss of the century? What's that? Come on, didn't you read Facebook last night? Yan would give Fung a kiss... in front of everyone. After he blows off the candles, then you go and kiss him. French kiss, if not, it won't be exciting enough. Mimi, find the best spot for it. Okay. Alright, get ready, go... Where are the candles? How old is Fung? How many candles? One is enough. Do you have a lighter? Lighter? Don't worry, we are with you. Scared? Wanna draw back? That's why I know you've found your true love. For me? This... ...is the ring that I designed, the "Perfect Wedding". We hope that you will be happy... very happy. I'm so happy for you. I do feel that I'm the luckiest person in the world. Thank you. OK Everybody, ready? Action! Excuse us... Come... What's up? Hey, my zipper... I haven't washed my hands yet! Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to Ah Fung... Happy birthday to you! Blow off the candles. The two of them? I've never thought of that. Thanks for throwing a birthday party for me. I'm so happy. But today will be my last day. I've settled the 30 times that I owed you. So, it's time for me to go. So soon, we'll miss you... We get along so well, too bad you're leaving. Thank you for giving me a beautiful memory... in this period of time. Thank you. Let's cut the cake. Yeah, cut the cake. Hold on... Wing, could you please reserve May 6th for me? Why? Is there a big project? Of course there is. I'm getting married. Lady first. Drink! Drink, come on. You drink, too. Come on, let's drink together... Drink! Why are you not drinking? I have to work tomorrow. Work the hell. She's getting married, there'll be no more work. No need to work anymore. OK? Drink together! Drink! Drink! Happy? Happy. Then drink. Let's drink together! You know where he lives? Don't go. Don't ever leave me again. Are you alright? Sorry... I drank too much. Sorry. I have a headache. Sorry. I have to go, sorry. Are we going to Nepal? Before you are joined in matrimony It's my duty to remind you of the solemn and binding character... of a marriage. By the public taking of each other as man and wife, in my presence and in the presence of the persons now here, you become legally married to each other, although no other rite of a civil or religious nature shall take place. I call upon all persons here present to witness that I, Lam Chung do take thee, Tze Mei Kee to be my lawful wedded wife. I call upon all persons here present to witness that I, Tze Mei Kee do take thee, Lam Chung to be my lawful wedded husband. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. You may exchange the wedding rings. Fung... You think this dress suits me? Not bad. Hey, where do you want to go? Up to you. Where do you want to go exactly? We've been walking back and forth here several times already. I really can't stand you anymore! He said hi on purpose. What does he mean? What's up? Do you dare to say you like me in front of everyone here? You could be quite a good boyfriend. But unfortunately, I'm not the one you like. There's nothing for me here, I'd leave him to you. Sorry. It's okay. What's going on? You still like Yan, right? If you like her, then why did you treat her like that? Jealousy, of course. What else can it be? But... why would you like a woman who's older than you? I never thought about that. See, he never thought about that! Why didn't you say it earlier? It's too late now! It's all your fault! Look, wedding invitation. I've skipped work a couple days, just because of you and Yan. It's me who told her to choose you. It's me who told her to buy you a cake, and kiss you in front of everyone. So, everyone'll know you're her man. Why did you kiss Flora instead? You know how proud Yan is. You provoked her like that, you become the loser! She's getting on board, why are you still standing here? "Who says I want to say goodbye?" "When will I ever see you again?" "Not seeing you a day is like a season." "Can you not leave me behind?" Aren't you a pilot? You also said you're a beautician. What? What? Here. And here... I don't have a girlfriend. Lying. I really don't. Isn't it amazing? You are so funny. I do have a sense of humor. Tomorrow, let's go to work hand in hand. So everyone would know that we're together. It'd be great! I've settled the 30 times I owed you. So, it's time for me to go. I'm getting married. "Who says I want to say goodbye?" "When will I ever see you again?" "Not seeing you a day is like a season." "Can you not leave me behind?" "The two dots gradually disappear in the dark." "The two lines never find the crossing point." "Our two shoulders miss each other in the wind." "When I turn, I should be able to see you." You left this book here last time. I was about to throw it away. Thank you. You're welcome. Can you tell me what book you're reading? Dan Brown? I like Dan Brown too. Ask me. Whether I like Dan Brown or not? Do you like Dan Brown? Very much. I wish I could sleep with him. What do you do? Take a guess. Any prize for that? Guess first. You're a pilot. You grew up in New York. Your father graduated from U Penn, he teaches politics. What about you? What do you do? I'm a beautician. I was so hurt. Then 3 months ago... it turned out to be me running away. Because in my heart... I was thinking about one person. I really... really miss this person so much. Since I'm so courageous,
