Yo, this was a great idea for a graduation trip! - I told you, this place is the shit! - You were right! Hey, you never told me Kelly's little sister was so slamming hot! Oh, come on, bro, she was 16 when Kelly and I started dating in college. - Ah... - Besides, she lives in London. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Isn't the legal age of consent, like, 16 in the UK? What are you doing to me? - Oh! - You fucking asshole! - Yeah! Fucking party! - Too slow, bitches! - Oh! - This place fucking rules! - Oh, my God! - Go! - Ok. - Oh! Oh, that's your girlfriend. I love this song. Oh, my God! Look at fucking Brock! - He's such a douche bag. - Oh! - Oh! - Shut up, be serious. I wanna make a toast to the two girls I love most in the world! - I love you, guys. - I love you, girls, too! Oh, my God! - Wait up. More shots? - Duh! We're in Europe! - Do you think Jesse is hot? - Oh, you're kidding me. - No, no. - He's always been nice to me. Uh, he's been friends with Kevin since freshman year. - Hey! Whoo! - Hey. Let's go! Guy, I just got us an invite to a sick mansion party. DJ, drinks, free fucking everything. Who's in? Fuck yeah! Let's go! Now who wants a goddamn shot? - I'll take one. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Whoo! Fuck! I think I died and went to heaven, bro! Hey, guys. I need to find a bathroom. I think I saw one at the bottom of the stairs. Ok, great. I'll be right back. Ok. Oh, shit! Oh, my God! - You scared me. - Sorry about that. Wow. - A lot of really cool shit in here, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, but we should probably get back. The girls sent me to come find you. Look at how old these paintings are. They must be worth a fortune. Hey, check this out. They all have the same last name. You think they're part of some kind of family lineage? Probably. I don't know. What I do know is that there is an extremely large, muscular security guard walking around that might kick us out if he found us in here. So we should probably stick to the main party. - Good idea. - Come on. - Drink up. - All right. Hey! I'm gonna go get a drink. Bartender, two shots, please. - American. - Uh, yeah. - I like your tats. - And that's your friend. Who? Him? - Yeah, I guess. - And his name? Brock. Do you want me to introduce... What the... - Whoa. - Do you like rough girls? - Brock? - Yes. I like. Fuck, I like. Gross! Look at all her tattoos and piercings! She's the perfect girl. She can take charge of him. I hope he chokes on her ring. Come on, fuckers, let's dance! Yay! Shit! I've never done anything like this before. When in Vilnius, right? Fuck it. This will do. Ready to get down right here? Now, take off that shirt and fuck me hard. Oh, fuck. Yo, Amy! Meet Uta. Uta, meet Amy. Uta, that's a cool name. Yeah, we kind of met earlier. Yeah. Uta means "prosperous in battle" or some shit. We're gonna go back to her tattoo parlor and check it out. - You're a tattoo artist? - I'm an apprentice. But you should get a tattoo from The Artist. - He's world famous. - Really? That... Amy, um, I don't think that's such a good idea. We were just leaving. Yeah. You coming to get a tattoo? Ok. Great. Well, let me tell the others. - Wait here. - Cock blocker. Don't worry. This changes nothing. Hey, guys. Guys! That girl's a tattoo artist. I'm gonna go back to her shop and get a tattoo. Do you guys wanna come? We're ok. We're gonna stay here. And then we're gonna head back to the hotel. Yeah, seriously. Come party with us. You can get a tattoo tomorrow. - I'll come with you. - Amy, she's a fucking freak. That shop is just a lame tourist trap. They're a dime a dozen out here. Amy, Jesse's right. Stay here. You don't know that fucking girl. Give me those tits. Come back here! Come on! Come on! Get in. - What is that? - It's human skin. Don't fucking touch that! You stay here. Ok. Oh, my God! Look at this dog! He's beautiful. Hi, boy! Hi, boy. I see you're getting acquainted with Beast. I'd be careful if I were you. No, he's a good boy. Aren't you? Yes, he is. Your shop is truly amazing. Yeah, bro, it's totally badass, man. I love that tat. I was thinking of getting the same thing, but check it out. Tyler James original, bro. Got that shit in Hollywood before he passed away. Rest in peace, bro. Tyler's work is very distinctive. I know it well. Now, which one of you wants to get tattooed? - Bam. - I do. Ok. Uta, my love, why don't you show our... guest around - and make him feel at home. - Yeah. One moment. Have a seat. - Nice jacket. - Thank you. Fuck! Take it easy. Ow! Fuck! That fucking hurts! You are one crazy bitch. Fuck it. So what kind of tattoo you looking to get? Well, this might sound stupid, but I wanna get something culturally relevant. You know? I was hoping that you could kind of guide me as well. Something to remind myself of this time in my life. That's not stupid at all. Finally, someone comes in from another country and actually asks about culture and history. Really, do you know how refreshing that is to hear? I can imagine. So, uh, do you get a lot of dumb tourists in here? You would not believe how many butterfly tattoos and praying hands I've done. Don't get me wrong, not that those are bad tattoos. It's just there was a time when to be tattooed, extensively, meant you lived outside the structures of conventional society. Now it's become conventional practice. Tattoo is commonplace. I don't know, maybe that's a good thing. It's good for business. You know, art for me is like newborn baby. It's innocent, you know, and not contest for judgment or for "wow, a trophy, man." Great tattoo artist. I don't care. It's art. - Yeah. - You understand? You're different. - Yeah? - It's not a question. I can see it. You're a rare breed. Hey. Where'd you go? Fuck! Whoa. What is this place? The Artist is a collector. This is the garrote. It was used to execute Spanish prisoners. Would you like to see how it's used? No. I'm good. But I wanna use you. Come here. I wanna fuck. Oh! Wow. These designs are beautiful. Yes, they are. - Hey, you want a drink? - Sure. Yeah. Uh-uh! Oh, fuck yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Mm. Hey. So... Your apprentice told us that that was human skin. It's not really human, is it? Yes, it really is. - You see, in the Yakuza culture... - The Yakuza? - I'm sorry... - No, it's ok. The Yakuza are members of a trans-national organized crime syndicate in Japan. In their culture, the tattoo artist owns the art and canvas, or skin, once the person passes on. - So were you the artist? - I wish. No, I... I obtained this piece from a very dear friend of mine. Wow. That's crazy. Well, you know, crazy to you, perhaps, but, you know, it is their tradition. And it's... it's a great honor to be tattooed. Hey, buddy. Steph and I are gonna go back to the hotel. - Uh, have you seen Amy? - She left with Brock. I saw them leave... fall down the stairs earlier. She's probably back at the hotel partying. Ok. We'll catch up with you later, buddy. I like this one. What does it mean? Great choice. Its literal translation... "Love forever." Fuck! Hey. Slow down. I don't wanna bust yet. - Harder. Harder! - Oh, fuck! I'm gonna come. Almost. Oh, fuck! Fucking bitch! So, Amy, what do you do back in the States? Mm, I'm a student. And I'm supposed to go to medical school in a couple of months. Um, we're here on vacation. And I really like it. There's some doubt in your voice about medical school. Am I that transparent? Yeah, I mean, it's what I should do. I'm just not sure if it's what I want to. Should do? Said who? Boyfriend? You dictate your own destiny. You still have time to find your true passion. True. Sometimes... you don't know until you try something. Hey, um... I think I might have drank too much. I'm feeling kind of lightheaded. Amy! Run! What did you do? You're right. He's perfect. No moles, no marks. No scars. Amy. Amy! Amy! What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? No, please! Please, help! Somebody help! Please! Amy, wake up. Amy. What the fuck are you doing? Amy! Amy. Wake up. What are you doing? What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Stop! Wait, wait, wait. Wait, let's talk about this. Wait. Wait. Stop! Please, no. Wait, wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, don't do this. No, no, no! No! Don't! No, no, no, no. Fuck! Please! Oh, no, no, no! Oh! Oh! Stop! Stop, please! What are you gonna do? Amy... There's so much I want to share with you. You're probably wondering why you can't move. - Well, you and your friend... - Fuck you! - Let us go! - ...have been injected with a neuromuscular blocker from the venom of a blue-ringed octopus. I find... it works quite well. And don't worry about it, you can still feel everything. Which is very important to this process. You're sick! Just let us go, please! Please! Please stop! Please, just let us go! Please! No! No, don't! Ah! Brock! Oh, God! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! No! - Oh, my God! - Oh, God! Please... Let us go. Look at him, crying like a cunt. Fuck you! Fuck you! Let me go! My friends, they have money. Please. I'll do anything. Sorry, but money cannot help you. And I'm afraid you have so much left to give. You know, I used to feed my dog pig ears. But they just don't have the same nutritional value. Beast. You're sick. Fuck you! Listen to him when he speaks to you, cunt! Uta, Uta. Release her throat. You're dead. Amy, what are they doing? This will shut you up, pussy boy. Leave him alone, you freak! The skin is the ultimate canvas. Flaying, or the process of removing the skin from the body, is actually an ancient practice used by the Assyrians in the Ming dynasty. They used to do it merely for execution and torture. Certain tribes in Europe discovered... - No! - The skin can serve a much higher... purpose. Since you're a medical student, Amy, or contemplating medical school, obviously you know there are seven layers of skin. Skin is actually an organ. We need to cut through all seven layers in order to create the perfect... canvas. - There. - Why? Why are you doing this to us? Why? No! Stop! Stop! Please! Don't! Amy, this is perhaps the most important step. No! No! - If you don't use this tool... - Stop! ...correctly to separate the skin... From the muscle, you can tear the canvas rendering it completely useless. In our case, you'd need another donor. What are you? Brock, I'm sorry. Why? Brock, please don't leave me. Oh, God. You see, Amy? The Yakuza got it all wrong. Skinning a dead man's body only wounds the canvas. Elasticity is gone. Sure, the ink stays, but it's the poor man's version. Why? Why are you doing this to us? I'm sure this is all a bit much to wrap your brain around. In time, you'll see. Uta, take this canvas to the gallery, prepare it. You're sick! What are you gonna do? Please, just let us go! He needs... he needs medical attention! Please! Let us go! Why? Oh, fuck. You better not like that slut more than me. Only you. - Who is it? - It's us! Let us in! - Oh, go away! - Oh, my God, seriously! Let us in! Oh, fuck. Fuck. I see you later. - She's got great timing. - I fucking hate Stephanie. Hello. Jeez. Wow. This is where I should have been, huh? - Seriously? - Shut the fuck up, Jesse. - Fuck. - What's so important anyway? Well, we checked all the rooms, and there is no sign of Brock or Amy. Um, ok. And? And they didn't come back last night. I've been trying to tell her, I'm sure Amy just hooked up with the loser. - Know what I mean? - Hey, chill, man. No, no. There's no way that Amy would hook up with Brock, and she definitely wouldn't just... not come back and not tell anybody. Exactly. We went downstairs, and they haven't seen them either. They left no messages. Ok, well, they were heading to that tattoo parlor with that freaky chick. Can anyone remember the name of it? - Or her? - We were wasted last night. I barely remember anything about last night. Ow. I'll check Brock's profile. He usually updates his photos. Wait. Let me see that. Yeah. Looks like, uh, Brock was obsessed with Amy. I just solved your case. No, he's just a pig. Yeah. Looks like Jesse's right. I got fucking nothing. Ok, look. I'm starting to get a bit worried. Maybe we should go out and look for them. - Yeah. - Oh, don't freak out, everybody. - I'm sure they're fine. - The brains of the group. Give us five minutes. We're gonna get changed and we'll meet you down in the lobby. Come on, let's go. Amy. I want to show you something special. A gift so unique... It only happens once in a lifetime. Perhaps you've heard of the Irezumi, or the hand-poked method of tattooing. I'm not sure what you're talking about. But please, please just let me go. I dip this needle in ink, and poke it through your skin, hundreds of times. And you will feel each poke. You must hold still. You have such beautiful skin. Stop! We went down one that looked like it. It wasn't this one. I'm telling you that on the map, there's one down here. - I swear. - This is it? - It's here. - All right. Go. Let me try, let me try. - Kevin, what happened back there? - Don't worry about it. - I think we should call the cops. - No, no. Wait to see what Jesse's got. This is the seventh tattoo place that we've been to. This was your idea. Guys, the owner just told me that freak works at a place called The Parlor, - not too far from here. - Really? - Yeah. - All right, cool. Let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Come on. - Straight ahead, right? - Yeah, right up here on the corner. Jesse, you going the right way? Right up here. Right around the corner. We should really go back to the hotel room. I think we'll find them. We'll find them. You have to trust me. Hey, guys. Uh, don't pay attention to these fuckers. Just walk. Don't even look at them. - Jesse, what the fuck are you doing? - Jesse, what the fuck? Jesse! You fucked with the wrong crew, motherfucker! - You fucked with the wrong crew! Fucker! - Jesse! What the fuck? Chill out! - What the fuck was that? - Dude, calm down. Chill! - Relax. It's cool. - It's cool? "You fucked with the wrong crew"? Who are you? Are you kidding me? Those kids were planning something! - How the fuck do you know? - Stop! They could have pulled a gun and killed us! You just risked our lives! You're no hero! Whatever, I'm protecting us, and I'm the fucking villain? - Unbelievable. - Jesse! - Un-fucking-believable. - Jesse! What the... I can't believe what just happened. I wish Amy would have called you and told you where she was going. Jesse, are you sure this is the place? Yeah. It says "parlor." Hello? Anyone here? - How can I help you? - Uh, hi. We're looking for our friends. Um, they came here last night with a goth girl. She was covered in tattoos and had heels. Yes. You mean my apprentice, Uta. - So you've seen them? - Yes, I saw both of them. I, um... I tattooed your friend... - Amy? - Yeah, Amy. That's her. Yeah. Yeah, I finished her tattoo about 4:00 am, and her and the guy left. Did maybe your apprentice girl, Uta, go with them somewhere? She lives here, so I don't see how that's possible, and we closed after they left. Guys, can we leave this shithole? They're not here. Jesse, chill out. Sorry, sir, he can be a bit of a hothead. Hm. I'm sorry I can't be more help. If you guys ever want a great tattoo, you're welcome back to this shithole any time. I hope you find them. Thanks. We appreciate it. Let's go. Oh. I just met your friends. They really do seem concerned about you. What did you do? Don't hurt them. Please, don't hurt them. I'll do anything, anything you want. Oh, I know you will. Don't worry. They have no interest in me. I sent them on their way. Amy... This tattoo will forever bond you to me. Every time you look in the mirror, you will see me. You will see us. I will be with you wherever you go. You're crazy if you think I'll be bonded to you forever. You wanted a tattoo that would make you remember your trip, right? I think you'll find this appropriate. Oh, my God! Ok, guys, I really think we should call the police. I agree. I don't trust that guy. He looked criminal. - Why, because he had tattoos? - No, that's not the point. Oh, come on, guys. You think we should report them missing? Yeah, you ladies are blowing this out of proportion. You know, I think that Brock just hooked up with your "angelic" friend, Amy, and they're just sleeping off their hangovers somewhere. You're so stupid, Jesse. Amy wouldn't do that. Whatever. How could they be missing? It hasn't even been a day yet. Seriously, stop it. What is your problem? You're being a total dick. That's my problem. Guys, we're on vacation, ok? There's no way I'm ruining it looking for that asshole. What the fuck, Jesse? Come on, bro. You're out of line. - You too, huh? - Guys, guys, stop. He remembered Amy's name. Ok, and why is that important? - Did he remember Brock's? - Ok, Sherlock. - What are you getting at? - Seriously, please. Fuck off. Kev, let me see Brock's profile again. - What's wrong? - I knew I'd seen that design before. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Guys, look! - Look! - What? Where? It was hanging in that creepy tattoo parlor. Oh, my God! That fucker's got Brock's tattoo in his parlor. Wait, wait, wait. Stop. Wait, now. What are you guys talking about? You're fucking nuts. How can there be Brock's tattoo? I'm sure that really generic douchebag design is in front of every fucking tattoo shop ever. I know that freak and his bitch have got something to do with this. - We've got to go back and check it out. - No fucking way. We're not going back there. Let's just call the police. Are you guys fucking kidding me? You're all nuts. We're on vacation in Europe. And it's beautiful out. And you wanna go on a wild goose chase, and back at that parlor with that fucking psycho-killer-looking dude. Seriously? It hasn't even been 24 hours yet. The cops will laugh at us. Back home, it's at least, 48 hours before you can file a missing person's report? Exactly, in the fucking United States. This is Lithuania. Yeah, out here it's probably two fucking weeks. - Oh, my God. I... Oh! - Kev, look at me. Amy'd do the same. You know it. Ok. We'll go check it out. You know what? Fuck this. You guys are nuts. I'm not going. - Fine, stay here. - Wow. - Fuck you, Jesse. - You turned out to be a total fucking idiot. And you're just mediocre in bed. I've had better. - Ok! Come on, guys! - Thank you... Enough! Jesse, we'll call you if we find them. - You do likewise, all right? - Just please fuck off. - Yeah, right... - All right! Come on. Dick. I'm sorry. Don't worry, we'll find Amy and Brock. Vodka, rocks, now. - How's your day going? - Good. And you? - Yep. Now. - Enjoy. Yeah. Can I take you to a table? Yeah? See? I told you! That... that tattoo does look like his design. - What the fuck? - You're here to see your friends? - What did you say? - Your boss said they left late last night. Our friends are here! Where are they and where's Amy? We're having a party for them. Would you like to join us? No, we would not like to join you! Where's Amy? I don't know, but maybe they are downstairs. - What? - Come on down. - Seriously? - All right, let's just go, come on! Where the fuck are they? How do you say it? Relax! I'll get your friends. We need to find Amy and Brock and get the fuck out of here. I don't know, I think we should just call Jesse. - Fuck! No service. - Shit! Come on, come on! Got it! Come on, Jesse. Come on, pick up your fucking phone. Fuck! Voicemail. Hey, Jesse, where are you? We're at that fucking parlor. Please call me back. - He's not picking up. - Well, call 911 or something! - Kevin! - What... Steph, run! What the fuck? Amy! Amy! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Run! - No! Kelly! - Shit. - Hey, it's Jesse, where are you? We're at that fucking parlor. Please call me back. Fuck it. - Would you like a dance? - Yeah. Fuck it, why not? Kelly! Kelly, wake up! Wake up! Kelly, please wake up! Kelly, Kelly, you have to try and get down. These people are fucking crazy. Kevin! Oh, my God! I don't know what the fuck's going on! Why... why is Stephanie on that table? Steph! Steph! What are they gonna do to her? They're skinning people alive. They killed Brock right in front of me. It's so fucked! Kelly, we have to get out of here before they get back! Stephanie. Stephanie! Stephanie! - Kelly, they're back. - Steph! - Kelly! - Stephanie! - Kelly! - Stephanie! - Please. Please... - Steph! - Please. Please. - Steph! - Hey, please! - You fucking bitch! - Don't touch them, please. - Bitch! - Please, no! - Steph! - Stephanie! - No, no, no! - No, no! - No! Steph! I suggest you calm down, or she will die earlier than we anticipated. Why? Why us? Please don't hurt her! Take me! Take me. Kelly, I told you to leave. You had the choice. But, as fate would have it, you came back. So, here we are. Uta, my love. This one will work. It's tainted. Yes, she's a perfect canvas for your lessons. Remember to make straight lines to ensure an even peel. Slow... And even. Understand? Save the other two for me. They are unexpected, but we can use them. The Swiss called with another order. I have an appointment to get to. Uta, you are not to lay a finger on Amy... ...no matter what until I return. Do you understand? Ok. Fuck you! Kel... Kelly! I can't... I can't move! - Don't you fucking touch her! - I can't move! Leave her alone! What's that? Stop! Stop! Aah! Kelly! Kelly! I forgot to use the fucking tool! No, stop, stop! No! No, leave her alone! Stop! Oh, my God! I'm Zala. What's your name? - That your real name? - Hm. No. I'm Jesse. Hey, Jesse. My shift's finishing. Do you wanna get drinks? I gotta meet some friends at a tattoo parlor. Uh, would you come with me? We'll party after. - Tattoo? Really? - Yep. Do they do piercings? I wanna do my clit. I don't know. Yes. I think so, I don't know. Ok. Let me throw something on. And I'll meet you outside in five. I can't touch you. But I can play with your friend. Fuck you! Ugh! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Fuck you! Hold it! Don't let go! Don't let go! You're almost there! It's ok. You can't free me. Go get help. Ok, ok! I promise, I promise I will come back for you and Kevin. I promise I will come back! - I promise, I promise! - Hurry! Run! Run! Oh, my God! Somebody help! Help! Help! Fuck! What have you done? Have I taught you nothing? Leave us. Amy. Amy. Amy. Amy, it's ok. It's me. You ok? Fuck you! No, I'm not ok! You're fucking crazy. Kelly's coming back with the police. No. I'm afraid Kelly won't be returning to us. No! Kelly! Amy. You're bleeding pretty badly. Let me help you. What? What do you care? You're just gonna kill me anyway. Please be seated. In the middle ages, a Russian king began the practice of having his family portraits painted on the skin of his enemies. My forefathers perfected this technique. There was no greater honor. These paintings were... And are priceless. Every frame in this room is painted on the back of a soul. Every soul is selected by the client. You sit... in a gallery of souls. Let's forget this place and go back to mine and fuck. How can I help you? Yeah. Um... She wants her clit pierced. Can you make that happen? Sure, I can make that happen. And I was supposed to meet some friends here. Um, have you seen them? Yeah. They're downstairs having a couple of drinks. You wanna join them, you're more than welcome. And you will come with me. Great. Hurry up, Jesse. Have fun. Put your jacket in here and come sit on the table. It's an interesting choice. How bad is this gonna hurt? You know, when I did mine I had an orgasm. Whatever. Just get it over and done with. I'll count to three. Oh! Here we go. - One... - Ow! Fuck! What happened to "count to three," you crazy bitch? - Fuck! - I forget. Can I get an ice pack or something? I'll get you one. What the fuck? Where the fuck are my clothes, bitch? Oh, fuck! Holy... Hang in there, buddy. I'm gonna get you down. What is it? What is it? Help... help Amy. - Help... - Fuck! Ok... Fuck. I'll be back. I'll be back. Oh, my God, Amy. Amy, fuck, you're alive. - Jesse? - What the fuck happened to your face? What are you doing here? You have to go! You have to go now! Go! Antonas, nice of you to join us. Antonas? Jesse, Jesse, run! - This wasn't the deal. - Deal? What deal? I swear, it wasn't supposed to be this way, Amy. Only Brock. I told you not to fucking go with him when we were at my house. Fuck. What do you mean, "my house"? What are you talking about? Amy, you still don't know, do you? Shut your fucking mouth. Antonas's family, the Cuzas, have been my family's clients for centuries. My dad is gonna shit when he sees this. Fucking awesome. Hey, so now what? You take the painting and you leave. That's how our arrangement works. But she knows about me. That's none of your concern. None of my concern? You need to get rid of her, you fucking idiot. What? Fuck you, Jesse! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Yeah? Good luck. Oh, nice tattoo, freak. Fuck you! Let's all take it easy. She's not going anywhere. We'll see what my dad says about that. You know what? Fuck this. You're done, bro. What the fuck? What the fuck, dude? Amy... now it is time for you to seize your true destiny. What? - I... I can't. - Yes, you can. And you will. Jesse's fate is in your hands now. I wonder if your head will come off. Hey! What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, thank God, Amy. Get me out of here, quick, before he comes back. Hurry up! Why did you set us up? Why would you do this? You fucking nuts? Get me out of here before he gets back! Why? I never wanted any of this. I was told to get someone I knew. It's a family tradition. My dad put me up to it, ok? My family has a lot of money and a lot of power in this country. You do what you're told! You don't ask questions! Listen. Just give me the painting. Let me get out of here, and I'll make you a very wealthy girl. Does it look like I do anything for money? Besides, your back is perfectly clean. What, are you fucking nuts? No! No! Watch it. Dude, man. Hey, bro. Can I get a tattoo? Hey, guys. Take a seat. The Artist will be with you in just a second. Welcome to The Parlor.
