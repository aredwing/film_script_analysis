Oh, honey, you know. It's not gonna stop me from asking. I would feel so terrible having six new students start with a substitute teacher. I still can't convince my wife to have a... a lovely weekend with her husband. We can sleep in, order room service. Room service? There probably isn't room service, but... We could... We could, uh, pick up some hamburgers and some strawberry milk shakes. Oh. You're getting me. I'm listening. Get all cozy. Put on some "Love Me Tender. " Ohh. I think we're in a jailhouse rock now. Ohh. How you doing? Did you sleep well? Uh-huh. Yeah? Yeah. I think you're heavier. Uh, yeah. Did you grow again? Uh, no. Rain check? IOU. Where's your brother at? I don't know. - You don't know? - No. I gotcha. Oh! Ohh! Ohh! Good morning. How you doing? Good. Yeah? All right, guys, there's not a lot of time. Nicole, no dogs eating at the table, please. - Thank you, darling. - Guys, there's not a lot of time. Eat your food real quick, please. Mom, I would love a cup of coffee. Now, you know Daddy's gonna be away for a couple of days, so... In January of 1989, I attended a church conference in the Trinity Pines suburb of Houston, where the focus was on the growth of the Union Baptist Church Association. I went because I was seriously considering starting a new church. We know that God is calling to us to tell others about heaven and how to go there. The Gospel begins right here, right where we are. And it travels. It travels to every neighborhood, every continent. And the prize... Mm. The prize that we shall receive... is heaven. Amen? Amen. Amen. Little did I know that some of the people listening that day would be there to help me later on. You know you did something baptist preachers almost never do. Oh, yeah? What's that? You finished early. Well, good morning, J.V. It seems like I have to walk to talk to you. If you walk the walk. I have to keep the ticker on track since my heart attack. How's that going, by the way? A whole lot better, thank you. Oh, good. Rumor has it that you're thinking about starting a new church? Well, you've started so many successful churches. It's a roller-coaster ride, beginning a new church. Three steps forward, two steps back. It's challenging. Worthwhile, but challenging. I believe it's time for me to start a new congregation. I would urge you to be certain that this is what God really wants you to do and that your family's on board with the idea. Sometimes what inspires you isn't what you end up doing. It's about finding your purpose. Thank you. That's it. That's what it's all about... finding your purpose. And remember, it's not about you. I appreciate that. Thank you, J.V. It's 10:00. On the dime. - How are you, darlin'? - Grading papers. How's it going? Good, good. No matter where you are in the world, you always manage to call me at 10:00 every evening. Is it tradition or love? Love of tradition. Very nice. So, I, uh... I had a good chat with J.V. Thomas about opening a new church. He was very encouraging. I'd say there's a great chance I can actually start something this year. Oh, that's exciting. We're behind you a hundred percent. I think I'm gonna have to wrestle the twins to bed. I don't know. That might be the sound of Nicole growing up. Oh, my, she'll be a teenager soon enough. Well, she is ordering coffee now. That's right. Well, my love, it's bedtime for all of us. All right, darlin'. Have a good night. And I miss you. And I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow. I love you. I love you. Night-night. Good night. I remember that only three weeks earlier, I'd received a traffic ticket for not wearing a seat belt. Until I received that ticket, I'd not usually worn my seat belt. But after that, well, I changed my ways. That small act would be a crucial decision. I believe in a great God. I believe in Jesus, the son of God. I believe in the Holy Spirit. I believe in baptism. I believe in communion. I believe in a great God. He's dead. - Don, hi. - Oh, Donnie, you're so beautiful. Can you hear me? State law decreed that a coroner had to pronounce me dead before my body could be removed from the wreck. There was no need for speed because... I was dead. I got no pulse. We got no pulse at all. All right? - Does anyone wanna call this thing? - Yeah. I got it. We need to clean this mess up so we can get this bridge open. Yeah, I got 12:15 now. According to the report, the collision occurred at 11:45 AM. Well, it's 1:00 PM. Hey. What's going on up there? Uh, a truck crashed into a car and another car over there. Multiple cars got hit. Officer. Dick Onerecker. I'm a minister. Is there anybody here I can pray for? Yeah. The people in those two cars over there. They're, uh... They're shaken, but they're fine. You can talk to 'em if you'd like. What about the, uh, car up there? The one with the tarp over it? The man in the red Ford is deceased. I'd like to pray for him. Well, like I said, he's dead. I- I know it sounds crazy, but, uh, I have to pray for him. If that's what you wanna do, go ahead. But I gotta tell you it's an awful sight. He's dead, and it's a real mess under that tarp. There's blood and glass everywhere, and the body's all mangled. I gotta warn you, you do what you want, but you've never seen anybody this bad. Try being a medic in Vietnam. I only know God told me to pray for you. He died instantly. There's no pulse. God, I pray... Yeah, that's what they said when I got here. that his sins are forgiven... We did everything we could, but the impact probably killed him. and that he's with you, God. We need to get the jaws of life ready for when the coroner gets here. Okay! I pray, God, that he knew you. His father and his friend. Oh, praise God! He's... He's singing! He's... He's alive! He... He's alive! He's... He's alive! The man... The dead man is singing in there! Oh, really? He's alive! He was singing with me! You just set a world record for exiting a wrecked car. Listen to me. He's alive. The dead man... Sir, I know a dead guy when I see him. That man is dead. Listen. He's alive. He was singing. We-We-We know our business, okay? He-He's dead. No! Listen, look, look, look, I'm gonna lay down on this bridge. You're gonna have to run over me if you don't go check on him. Just do me a favor. Just check on his pulse, please. Just... Just check his pulse, that's all. I'll check on him. Come on. Praise God! - We got a pulse! - Yes! Come on! Let's go! On three, fellas. One, two, three. We learned a lot about seals today, didn't we? Yes. Yes. So I would like for you to please draw your favorite underwater animal. - Can you do that? - Yes. Yes? I can't. I'm teaching a class. Well, come anyway. It's important. That's good, Annie. Mrs. Nell needs you in the office right away. I'll watch your class for you. Okay. Thank you. Hi, kids. We're gonna get you to the hospital soon. Can you tell me your name? Now, you just stay with me. Try to stay awake, okay? Please, sit down. Don's been in a wreck. What? A wreck? What do we got here? Easy. Airway looks clear. We need to get two large 4-IVs in. Check in the airway. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Have you heard anything? No, nothing. Thank you. Let's cut that right sleeve. Both IVs in there. And the BP cuff's gotta go on there too. Oxygen, PQ. Mr. Piper. Mr. Piper. We're gonna do all we can to save you, Mr. Piper. Don has been taken to the Huntsville Memorial Hospital just off the 1-45. He's conscious. She should probably speak to him now. It doesn't look good. - Would you like to speak to Don? - Yes, I would. We don't let people speak to patients unless it's a grave situation. All right. - Hello? - He's unable to hold the phone himself, so I'm gonna put it up to his ear. Don? How are you? I'm so sorry that this happened. It's not your fault. I just wanted to come home, Eva. Please let me come home. Please let me go home. All right. Thank you very much. They're doing an assessment. Uh, what do you mean... Uh, what is "assessment"? They need to assess his injuries and try to stabilize him. There's a chance that Don may move hospitals. I'll take the twins home with me, so you don't need to worry about the boys. Thank you. Hey, I'm driving you to the hospital. No, no, that's... You don't have to. I will drive you. Thank you. Yeah. He's deteriorating rapidly. I don't think he's gonna survive the afternoon. Put him in an ambulance and take him to Houston. This facility isn't equipped. Don't you think we should helicopter him to Hermann? No. Nobody's flying in this weather. As my condition was deteriorating rapidly, it was decided to move me by ambulance for the 80-mile trip back to Houston's Hermann Hospital which had a much better trauma center. Still, I kept wondering why God had brought me back. Ah, hey, you gotta do something. You gotta... Medicine, plea... You gotta give me some medicine. - I've given you all I can. - No, you gotta give me more. Ma'am, my name is Eva Piper. Has my husband, Donald Piper, arrived? - He's in transit and should be here any moment. - He's not here yet? No. He'll be coming in from over there when he does. Don? Don? I'm here. They're gonna take good care of you. Listen to me. It wasn't your fault. You're gonna make it. Ma'am, we've gotta go. You're gonna make it. We need you to fill out these insurance forms. Thank you. I know, uh, Don's date of birth. I don't know his social security number or his insurance company. I don't know the amount of the deductible. Don's always taken care of this. I don't have the answers... It's okay. It's okay. These are the easy questions for now. All I know is that Don is supposed to lead evening services. He's meant to preach tonight. They already have that covered. I don't know any of this. Ma'am, I filled out what I could, but I don't... I don't have his information. I'll get it to you tomorrow. That's okay. We deal with this situation every day. Thank you. Oh. It was heartwarming to know Eva had the support of our friends and fellow church members in her hour of need. Surgeon Kelly, please report to Room 25. It's been over an hour. I can't stand the tension of not knowing. I'm gonna find out what's happening. Eva, Eva. I need answers. Doctor? May I help you? I'm trying to find out what's going on with my husband, Donald Piper. No one's been out to see you yet? No, no one. I've heard nothing. I'm so sorry. I'm Tom Greider, the orthopedic surgeon on this. Um, come on and I'll show you what's going on. Your husband is very badly injured. We are doing everything we can to save him. See this? It's not just broken. It's shattered. He's missing significant amounts of bone structure, muscle and skin. That's his right knee. And this is where the left thigh bone, or femur, should be. Should be? Well, he's missing a significant amount of bone. Four and a half inches. Also, it seems that he has a cracked pelvis. But, uh, we're just gonna let that go for the time being, 'cause we have to deal with these other injuries right away. As you can see, only this soft tissue at the bottom part of his leg is connecting his whole lower left leg to the rest of his body. Would you like to see him? Yes, I would. Well, come on. He won't respond to you. He's heavily medicated. We couldn't give him anything until we'd finished our examination. They're coming to take him to surgery now. God. God help me. Please help us. I'm so scared. You've always helped us. Now, please... please help us. Please help us. For I know the plans they have for you. Plans to prosper you. And to not harm you. To give you hope and a future. Survival was going to be difficult because heaven was so glorious. Hi, Dad. Okay. Not good. I don't know. I don't know, Dad. I'll see you tomorrow with the kids. I just spoke to Don's parents. They aren't getting here until the day after tomorrow. I love you too. Bye. The reason you haven't heard from us is 'cause we worked on him all night. - All night? - Eleven and a half hours. The good news is there's no sign of brain damage or internal injury. We stabilized his left arm and put his left leg in traction. We're taking good care of your husband, Eva. He's gonna be okay. Thank you, Doctor. There are a lot of people in the hospital chapel praying for Don right now. How you doing? Okay. I don't want you to think about this now, but you should consider hiring an attorney. Enduring all that I had to go through, nobody put up with more than Eva. She would rise every morning at 6:00, rush to work at the school and afterwards hurry back to my bedside, where she stayed with me every night. It was the same stressful routine day after day for her. You're seriously injured. We've done an MRI on you, and it seems you've escaped brain damage. I hurt more than I believe is humanly possible. We can help you manage that. I just want relief. I understand. Your family's here to see you. The hardest thing to endure was having my family, especially my children, seeing me in this physical state. Don? It's okay, boys. Say hi to your dad. Nicole. I love you, Daddy. I love you, Dad. Love you. I love you, Chris, so much. I have a Valentine's Day dance coming up. I'm very excited. Although I don't know if I have a Valentine. Daddy will dance with you. Two goals, Dad. That's what I got. One bounced off the pole. Excuse me. It's, uh... It's time for some cleaning. Okay. I'll see you guys soon. Okay, bye. All right. Come on, guys. Go be with your grandparents for a minute, okay? Be good boys. See you guys soon. We have the best kids in the world. Yeah. We sure do. Hi. How y'all doing? You okay? Joe? Okay. Eva, I think the kids should come home with us. We'll find a school for 'em close by, and that way you won't have to worry about if they're being taken care of or not. Yeah, and-and that way you can focus fully on taking care of Don. Let me talk to Don first. I'm not sure if that's a decision he can make right now. Dad. You live 250 miles away. We won't be able to see them every day. I know. I know it's gonna be tough. But Don needs you now. And we can bring the kids back anytime you want. It's best if I speak with Don. All right. Okay. Hi. How you doing today? Hmm? How you feeling? My dad thinks it would be better for them to take the kids back to Louisiana, at least until we can get you out of the hospital. I don't think that's a very good idea. I know. But it'll be better for them. Because that way I don't have to keep finding people to take them to school and pick them up every day. It's not a good idea, Eva. It's going to be impossible for me to return to teaching school and maintain health insurance, spend time with you and find the energy to take care of our children. No. Don. Letting my parents take the kids is the only sensible solution we have here. I want you to agree. I will find peace if we both agree to let them go. I'm sending them home with my parents. Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order? Hi. Yes. We will have two cheeseburgers, two shakes and two fries, please. Thank you. Please pull up to the window. Until it was time for me to come home, Eva would never sleep in our bed. And that couch was not comfortable. I know, 'cause I've been there. Yes. Hello. My name is Eva Piper. I'm looking to hire an attorney. Mrs. Pepper? Piper. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Cecil Beaumont. Pleasure. I am your Beau. Before we start, can I ask you a question? Yes. How did you hear about me? Billboard. There was a sign by a drive-through. See there? A sign. Something we all need in a time of uncertainty, don't you think? Your husband was hit by a state truck from the prison, is that right? Yes. Cherry. Driven by an inmate? Cherry. Now, it's not illegal for them to let an inmate drive a truck. But it shows poor judgment on the part of those officials at the prison to let an untested, inexperienced driver take control of an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. Triple cherry! Ka-ching! Jackpot! Several of my friends are concerned that there might be some kind of a cover-up or that the State of Texas will try and deny who drove the truck. Well, your friends, are they attorneys? No. Okay. Their legal advice is worth what you paid for it, okay? There might be an attempt to alter the circumstances surrounding the accident. I mean, that's more likely what they'll do. Uh... You know, they're on the hook for a pretty big claim here. So I think we can assume pretty stout pushback from the State of Texas. Do we have a case? Excuse me. 918's Tulsa, isn't it? I'm sorry. Wha... You, uh... Did you just ask, do we have a case? Ma'am, I wouldn't be here if there wasn't a case. I am your Beau. And "mont," as in you have a "mont-umental" case. That's not that good, is it? "Mon," as in you have a "monster" case. How about "mont," as in, you have a case the size of "Montana"? These medical bills are gonna be astronomical, and you probably don't have the resources to cover that, do you? No, we don't. How are the children doing? Who wants to say grace tonight? Nicole said it last night. Boys? Um... Joe? Chris? Chris, you go ahead. You're older. Like 10 minutes older. Well, then you have a head start, right? Thank you, Father, for the food on our table, and please look over our dad, and... and for allowing me and my brother to skip our homework tonight. Well, this father's not gonna allow that to happen. Oh, yes, you are. Can I help you? You sounded like you were in great pain. What are you talking about? You cried out. God. Is this what you brought me back for? Yes, dear, you came back to me. All right, breathe. Deep. Deep breath. Deeper. Huh. Another. All right. Let's get you ready. - For what? - Taking a breath. You need to leave this on, all right? That's good. Oh, God. Please, God. I'm Dr. Houchins. You stop breathing on my watch, I won't be undefeated. All right, let's get you into a position to win. All right, take a deep breath. Don't give up now. Keep trying. Did you hear what I said? Do it, now. Breathe. Do it. Cough. Breathe and cough. Do it. Do it. Breathe. This is not a negotiation. Do this right now. Breathe. I can't. All right. Don't do it. If you don't start breathing and soon, I'm gonna have to resort to a ventilator. You won't like that. What Dr. Houchins might have lacked in bedside manners, he made up for in sheer bulldog determination. He simply wanted me to breathe. And I had stopped trying. Don? You gotta breathe. Please, can you breathe? For me? You're not even trying. Breathe! Breathe. Billie. Sarge. He's this way. How are you doing? Well enough. Oh. Don's just through here. He's stable. I'm sure he'd love to see you. I can't. I- I... I just can't. No. Okay, that's okay. It's all right. Here, come with me. Come here. I knew my mother would have the most difficult time seeing me in this condition, and never entered my room during the entire stay in the hospital. No mother would wanna see her son like that. I've got to make this phone call, okay? Okay. I'll be right back. David, I don't know what to do. His mom can't even be in the same room with him. She's devastated. He's not gonna make it unless something happens. You and Cliff are Don's best friends. He won't breathe. He refuses to breathe. You're the only other person in the world who will make him listen. All right, I'll be there as quick as I can. Probably around three hours. Thank you. World War II, Korea and Vietnam. That was my father. Son. I'd give anything to trade places with you. David. Thank you for coming. He's this way. David Gentiles was my best friend. Like myself, he was an ordained minister who was by far the most loving human being I'd ever known. You're gonna make it. You have to make it. You've made it this far. Uh... I don't know that I wanna make it. You have to. Not for yourself, then hold on for us, Don. I'm tired. I fought all I can and I'm ready to die. Well, then you won't have to do a thing. We'll do it for you. We won't let you die. Do you understand that, Don? We're gonna pray all night. I'm gonna call everybody I know who can pray. I want you to know that all of us who care about you will be up all night in prayer for you. We're taking over from here. We're gonna take care of this. He's in bad shape. Emotionally, there's no will to live. What is there left for us to do? Pray. We all have talents. David's was organizing. He was able to rally churches from all over the world to pray for me simply by faxing them. How long will my dad be like this? Well, it's gonna take some time to heal. All I do is press my palms together. It's not doing anything. It's not making my mom happy or my dad better. Well, honey, you gotta keep praying. You know what they say about faith. You can have hope without faith, but you can't have faith without hope. Grandma loves you. I love you too. My sweet baby. I want you to go to sleep now, okay? I love you. I'll see you in the morning. - Eva. - Morning, Doctor. Don has developed pneumonia in both lungs. If we can't do something about his breathing, we're gonna have to do something else drastic. How drastic? The Ilizarov device stabilizes, and then at the same time, if successful, which is a huge if, what it does is it stretches the bone by pulling on both ends. See, new bone is created by actually breaking the leg above and below the original breaks. We push the broken ends closer and closer together until they meet and then they form a new femur. Will that work? Ah, that's just it. I can't guarantee that it'll work. We can't give him the kind of breathing treatments he needs as long he's in the prone position. See, we have to elevate him. And that leaves us with two choices. One is that we amputate the leg. And the other is that we try this Ilizarov device which is called the fixator. People take sometimes months of counseling before they allow this device to be used on them. And, of course, in Don's case we don't have that kind of time. But there is a chance to save the leg? There is a chance. May I have a moment, please? Of course. I didn't realize you were home. Brought the kids by to pick up a few things. It doesn't feel like a home. There's no, "Hi, Mom. " Eva, it's gonna get better. But how much worse? We can't pay for anything. This house is a mess. He might not come home. Will he even survive? He might never walk again. I'm so afraid. It's gonna be fine. We're gonna get through this together as a family. That's what families do. Shh. I'm here. I'm here. Help! Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. What is that? It's a bone growth device. What is that? What is that? A fixator. Dr. Greider says it's the only chance we have to save your leg. Okay? Shh. And those rods go all the way through my leg? It's a new... And my arm? It's a new technique. Shh. I believe it's worth the risk. Why did you let them do this to me? Huh? Unfortunately, these were the only fireworks left in our marriage at this point. Rodeo's over. Fireworks are on. Eva's decision to keep my leg was so that I could continue to enjoy skiing and biking with the children. I always felt bad about how I spoke to her that day. Try to control your breathing. Slow it down. You can scream if you want. Easy. This pain... I know. Almost done. Good morning, Doctor. How long do I have to endure this device? How long before I... I know if it works? How long before I can walk again? A few months. How few? Many months. Maybe more. You mean possibly a few years? A year maybe. I really don't know. And there's no guarantee that I'm gonna be able to keep these limbs? No guarantee. You could develop an infection and we'd have to amputate the leg. So I could endure this for months and still end up with no leg? I'm hoping your left arm has a better chance. We took bones from your right pelvis and put them in your left forearm. It's kind of like taking core samples when you're drilling for oil, as an example. We're going to have to move Mr. Piper to St. Luke's tomorrow. Why do we have to move him? I believe Don should be able to stay here. I agree. But this is out of my hands. I've done everything I know to prevent this from happening. But I can't stop it. There's a situation at the hospital. Our insurance no longer covers Don's treatment here. Is there anything you can do? I need answers. Yes, of course you do. I'm your Beau. You at the hospital? Yes. Meet me in the cafeteria. I tried, but the administrator's right. They're not gonna budge. - There's nothing you can do to change things? It's about what the hospital can get from the insurance company. What about our case? Our settlement? Well, I've got good news and I've got bad news, but the bad news takes out the good news, so all we're left with really is bad news. What? Well, in Texas, state employees are indemnified by the State of Texas. Okay, how does this affect us? Well, the state, in this case, Texas, has put a cap on all damages that are able to be collected in any lawsuit against the state. And the cap is $250,000. Now, insurance companies, they have subrogation rights, which means that they're gonna put a lien against any kind of claim and settlement or any funds received from a lawsuit, to cover their medical expenses. In other words, your insurance company is gonna take all the money. Don will receive nothing? No. You know, I had a friend one time, he asked me. He said, "What kind of cookies you bake when you don't have any money?" I said, "I don't know. What?" He said, "Shortbread. " Unfortunately, Don's gonna have to bake shortbread cookies on this one. He'd been better off if he'd been hit by a Budweiser truck. And then we'd all be talking about millions of dollars. Sorry. Partner, can I give you that card? You show up here just to tell me this? How we gonna do this? We'll take him by ambulance. You can drive your car. Even though St. Luke's was only five blocks away, it was such a painful move with the fixators on my leg and arm. Every bump resonated through my bones. Eva stayed strong, tried not to cry out as she watched me go through this. It's not very pretty here. It's not ideal. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Don. When they picked this color blue, it must have been a cloudy day. Mr. Piper, Mrs. Piper, how you guys doing today? Hi there. Thank you. Good, good. I've got some relief for you, Mr. Piper. I'm gonna take good care of you, okay? Let me just have that arm. I'm gonna just hook this up for you, and this will make you feel a lot better. All righty. This is real simple, Mr. Piper. All you need to do is... Anytime you feel you need some relief, this will just take it all away for you. All I need you to do is push this little button here, and it releases medication. All right? And just call me if you need me. All right, Mrs. Piper? - Thank you. - All right. You're welcome. Mr. Piper and Mrs. Piper, how you doing today? We're fine, thank you. Good. And how about him? Hey, Mr. Piper. So, have you eaten today? Hmm? Did you have therapy today? Did Dr. Greider come by? Have you had a bowel movement today? Maybe that's why you're so grumpy. All right, I'll be back later to check up on you. Just let me know if I can get you anything. Thank you. You're welcome. Why don't you talk? I can't figure out what's going on inside of you. What happened to you? Talk to me. Don, answer me. I'm sitting right here. Please. Why aren't you answering me? Where do you go? You're not even here anymore. Is there something you want to tell me? Where's my husband? He's not here. I miss him. Should I get that for you? Should I answer that for you? Hello? How's Don? He doesn't talk, he lies here, and he doesn't seem to care. - Hi, Dad. - Let me call you back. Okay. What's that? I know I should have been grateful to be alive. My downcast attitude was taking its toll on everyone. But I just felt like something was missing and I didn't deserve to be here. Hi, Daddy. Okay, kids, it's time to get on the road. We need to not tire out your father. It's okay, Dad. I'm gonna take them on the first floor to the McDonald's. Come on. Come on, baby. Come on. Are you okay, Mom? Yeah. I never would have dreamed that cheeseburger and fries would be so good. I'm in love with french fries. You're in love with french fries? Me too. Do you think Dad will be home for my birthday? I hope so. I know he wants to. Grandpa, um, makes us do our homework before we go to the lake. As he should. But he doesn't help us like you do. Don, I came to say good night. You don't want to say good night? I am tired of this. You don't seem to care about anything. You don't care that you're back here with us. You don't care when the children come and visit you. You don't want to grow old with me? Or see the children get married? You don't care. You can take your pain away with that button, but you are causing it to everyone else. Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order? Sorry. That's not on the menu. Lord. Oh, God... Does it really have to be like this? The pain... of the injuries, I can handle that. Even seeing the pity and the helplessness in the eyes of the people who love me and care for me... I can get through that. But if this is as good as it's ever gonna get, I don't wanna be a burden. I was just trying to get back to Alvin, and you took me to heaven. Why can't you take me back? Now. I wanna go back to heaven, my home. My home is heaven now. Oh, Jesus, let me come back home, please. Please let me come back home. Well, South Park hired me to be your interim while you're, uh, incapacitated, so I guess you can say I'm out of retirement. Uh, can I get you a magazine? Would-Would you like a... a milk shake? How about a hamburger? You lost quite a bit of weight, son. Would you like for me to read to you from the Bible? Or any other book, for that matter? Really, no. Thanks for coming. You know, you really need to get your act together. Sir? You need to get your act together. You're not doing a very good job right now. Uh, I'm not sure I understand. Besides that, you're a raging hypocrite. I don't know what you're talking... You got all these people out there who care so much for you, and you have no idea how much they love you. I know they love me. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, you're doing a pretty poor job of letting them know you're aware of that fact. I don't think you're treating them right. Now, they can't heal you, but they would heal you if they could. And if they could trade places with you, many of them would do that. - Yeah... - And do anything for you without any waver. I don't want them to do anything. Truth is, I don't even want them to be here. I'd just as soon they not come. I- I-I know it's inconvenient. They must have better things to do. I know that. Why would I want anyone to come see me like this? Huh? It's awful. It's not your call. It's not about you. You spent the better part of your life trying to minister to other people. Trying to be there for their needs. And to be there for them through difficulty and tragedy. I- I've tried to. And yet you have deprived them of doing the same thing for you. And that's all they have to offer you, Don. And you're taking that gift away from them. I appreciate them. I do. I-I know they want to help, and I think that's very fine and all, but... But nothing! Now, I want you to let them in, you hear me? You're going to let them in and let 'em help you. I can't. Well, if you don't feel like you can for yourself, what about doing it for me? What about next time somebody walks through that door and wants to do something for you... I don't care what it is... say yes. Let a few folks express their love by doing something for you. I mean, promise me that you'll do that. Just... Look, just try it for me. You're gonna need to get better at this. Now, this is one of the lessons that God wants you to learn. All right, I promise. People are God's hands to meet your needs and answer your prayers. We'll just keep looking till it feels right. What kind of house are we looking for? Well, probably something one-story. Manageable to get around in for Dad. Is Dad gonna be in a wheelchair? Yeah. For a little while. As the medical bills were mounting, Eva looked for a house that we could afford, that would accommodate my needs once I was discharged from St. Luke's. Hey, hey, hey. There he is. Got something for you. Look, let me do it. Looks like you need my help. How are you today? Not speaking to me again? Hmm. Okay. It's a letter. It says, "Hi, there. We share wrenches. Fortunately for both of us, our fixators are interchangeable. And we can borrow tools from one another. " That's so cute. Look it there. It's a happy face. Who is this? Oh, this is from Christy. Christy is a teenage girl that lives in the next room. She was born with one leg shorter than the other. So she had to have surgery to attach the Ilizarov frame, like yours, so that both legs would be of normal size. She has a fixator too? She goes on. "And we share something else too. Pain. " She says, "I hear you scream at night sometimes as you probably hear me too. Although our nurse says that you don't admit to it. " Don't-Don't-Don't shoot me now. I'm just the messenger, Mr. Piper. And she goes on and says, "You're not alone. Sincerely, Christy. " That is so sweet. Can you get me a pen and paper, please? I can if you acknowledge me. There you go. I like that. All right. I'll be right back. That's my boy. Dear Christy, in some of my worst moments of self-pity, I think of never being normal again. I believe that when all of the pain is over, Christy, you will be a normal young woman. You will play and run and do everything a normal teen can do. You're doing something that positively impacts the rest of your life. Keep the faith. Kindest, Don. If God brings you to it, he will bring you through it. It's not long before you go home. This is your first step in that direction. My first step is wanting to vomit. Yeah, nausea will get you every time. Your equilibrium has changed. You've grown used to being in a horizontal position. I'd like my tools back. Hi. I'm Christy, your long-lost pen pal. Or Hopalong Cassidy, as my friends say. Hi. I'm Don. How are you? Could be worse. How's that? Okay, you got me. It can't get much worse. The endless reruns OO AM? Yeah, well, I wish my only problem was getting hit in the face with a football like Marcia. I'd take a broken nose to dance normal. You'll dance. Only the truest friends show up when you have to move. Trust me, this is a vacation. Oh, vacation? Yes, from my children. Ah, well, thank you. Remember when Don's parents gave us this painting? Oh, yes, I remember. I remember you tried to pawn it off on me, and then Susan, and the Goodwill store. That's not true! That is true. I never told Don. Is all this stuff going to fit in the new house? I think so. This place just isn't gonna work for Don. You know, with all the stairs and him being in a wheelchair. Plus, the new home is closer to the church. That will be nice. Just came by to check on you, see how you were doing. You're looking good. I hear you're gonna be going home before long. Anything I can do for you before I go? That-That's a very fine offer. Um... - I wish I had a magazine to read. - You do? Really? I think so. I- I haven't read one in a while. Well, all right. Give me just a minute. Jay B. Perkins, a retired minister, was a powerful father figure to me. And I was grateful for his service to my church while I was incapacitated. This ought to do you. There you go. Th-Th-Thank you much. That'll keep you busy. I'll read them a bit later. Yeah. Anything else I can do? No, that's... that's all I need. Thank you. You know, when you open the door and let somebody do something nice for you, it turns out not to be so hard after all, huh? You were right, J.B. I thought that relieving people of the responsibility of having to care for me was the right thing to do. It wasn't. They would heal me if they could, and since they can't do that, they were caring for me in... in the only way that they can. I have denied them the... the blessing of caring. You've loved me enough to tell me the truth. I won't forget it. And I never have. After 34 surgeries and nearly four months in the hospital, Dr. Greider said I could go home. Bye. Thank you. Dr. Greider. Hold up a sec. Tell me something. Just how bad was I when they brought me in the night of the accident? I've seen worse. But they didn't live. Thank you, sir. He would become a friend of mine from that day forward. Bye, Christy. Bye. - I want you to call me when you get out of here. - Will do. - Hi, Daddy! - Hey, Dad. How do you like the new house? What do you think? Welcome home, Daddy. Welcome home. - I think I'm home. - There's the kitchen. Did you put milk in it? I'm just gonna do this. I know. Is it good? Mm-hmm. Smells good in there. Why don't you... We're gonna play a game. Okay, you ready? Eva organized something called "The Don Patrol," a group of church members and friends who took care of me so that she could teach and we could keep our insurance. The Don Patrol would arrive around 9:00 while I was still sleeping. Good morning. I might awake to seeing one of the Susans knitting on the couch at the end of my bed. Or someone would be there with a toothbrush - so I could brush my teeth. - Looking good. Oftentimes holding a glass of juice before I was done doing that. - Maybe even offering an electric shaver. All right, I've never actually used one of these before. It's pretty simple. You know what? It doesn't actually work. And a big lunch. Turkey sandwich, oatmeal cookie, pickles. You can't pass up baby pickles. I'll take the apple. Okay. Another friend might be reading the newspaper, ready to entertain me. Yeah, whatever you need. I'll even sing for you if you want. Some guests would even make themselves quite comfortable. Hey, Butterfly. Come here. Butterfly. No! Butterfly, no! Hey! Hi, honey. Everything okay? Uh-huh. You sure? Yeah. It smells like pee in here. I know. It was the dog. It's okay if you can't make it to the bathroom. It was the dog. Butterfly? Hey, Dad. Come on. You can do it. Aaah! I did it. I did it. I walked! I walked. Oh, Lord, I walked. - What's going on? - What's happening? Ma'am. Ma'am. Where Don? Where's my husband? Ma'am. I'd like for you to consider this as a private matter. Private? Private. This is my house. I've seen it all. Hey. - Bet you haven't seen this yet. - What's going on? I, uh, got my fixator stuck to the toilet seat. Oh. Happy birthday! This is a perfect day. God has given me children so much better than I deserve. How can I ever thank you for all they mean to me? You being alive is the gift. Dad, will you dance with me? Ah, sweetie, I'd like to, but... Please, Dad. Please? I don't think I can. I might need you to help me up here. David! What are you doing here? I'm in town for a discipleship weekend. It's the excuse I use to come into the house and spend time with you. Thank you for your friendship. And your relentless commitment to prayer. Of course, Don. How you feeling now? In pain. But I'm always in pain. That's... That's not the worst part of it for me right now. There are things I can't physically do anymore. I'm not sure that God wants me to continue at South Park. I feel loved and needed there, but I'm not sure it's where I should be. What did you learn from y-your accident and your recovery experience? Letting other people inside. Allowing others to help me. But in the midst of all the suffering and despondency, David, I've learned that heaven is real. - What do you mean by that? - I died that day. The next moment I stood in heaven. Why haven't you mentioned this before? I have two very good reasons for that. Number one, I go around talking about having been to heaven, and people will think I'm nuts. Why would you think that? You just told me. - Number two... - I don't think you're nuts. Number two, I don't wanna go over that experience again. It's too personal, too special. It's my sacred secret. Is it possible that God took you to heaven, brought you back so that you could share your experience with others? Don't you realize what a powerful encouragement you could be? I want you to make a covenant with me. What kind of a covenant? It's simple. Find someone you trust. Share a little bit about your story just to gauge their response. If they think you're crazy or you hallucinated, I promise, I promise you never have to talk about it again. But if they rejoice with you and urge you to tell them more, I want you to take it as a sign. A sign that God wants you to talk about those 90 minutes you spent in heaven. - I think I can do that much. - When? Soon. I promise. Very soon, right? All right. Very soon. Hi, honey. Hi, darlin'. Hey, David. Glad you could make it. Soon as in now. Honey? Yes. Darlin', I want to tell you something. What's that? Remember the day I-I left for the convention? Uh-huh. Well, that morning just plays over and over in my head. And you said, "I.O.U." Yes. And I do. Well, in fact, I think I owe you. Oh, don't I know it. I've been waiting a long time for that. I owe you an explanation. Darlin', would you sit down for a second? Please. You know, I died in that accident. When I woke up, I was in heaven. You went to heaven? Yes. Tell me more. When I died, I didn't flow through a long dark tunnel. Uh... I had no sense of fading away or coming back. I heard no voices calling to me or anything like that. Simultaneous with my last recollection of seeing the bridge, the rain, a light enveloped me, with a brilliance beyond earthly comprehension or description. In my next moment of awareness, I was standing in heaven. It was perfect. And I knew right then I would have no needs and never would again. I didn't even think of Earth or of those left behind. Though I did not see Jesus face-to-face, I did sense his presence at every turn. And I did see people I had known. As they surged towards me, I knew instantly that all of them had died during my lifetime. Their presence seemed absolutely natural. It was as if God had removed anything negative or worrisome from my consciousness. And I could only rejoice at being together with these wonderful people. Donnie, I'm so excited you're here to join us. I saw Papa. You know, my grandfather that everyone called Joe. I heard his voice and felt his embrace. I'd been with him when he'd suffered a heart attack at home and had ridden with him in the ambulance. I'd been standing just outside the emergency room at the hospital when the doctor walked out and faced me. The doctor shook his head and said softly, "We did everything we could. " As I walked among them, I became aware of the wide variety of ages. Old and young and every age in between. Many of them hadn't known each other on Earth, but each had influenced my life in some way. Even though they hadn't met on Earth, they seemed to know each other now. One person in the greeting committee was Mike Wood, my childhood friend. He was a popular kid and became a hero to me because he lived the Christian lifestyle and often talked about it. After high school, Mike received a full scholarship to Louisiana State University. When he was 19, Mike was killed in a car wreck. When I attended his funeral, I wondered if I would ever stop crying. I couldn't understand why God had taken such a dedicated disciple. Through the years since then, I had never been able to forget that pain and sense of loss. Then I saw Barry Wilson, who had been classmate in high school, but later drowned in a lake. Barry's smile radiated a happiness I didn't know was possible. And I saw my great-grandmother Hattie Mann. As a child, I knew her only after she had developed osteoporosis. Her head and her shoulders were always bent forward, giving her a... a sort of humped appearance. But the beautiful thing is, she didn't carry these burdens in heaven. Heaven was many things, but without a doubt, it was the greatest family reunion of all. A holy awe came over me as I stepped forward. I had no idea what lay ahead. But I sensed that with each step I took, it would grow more wondrous. Then I heard the music. I can only describe it as a holy swoosh of wings. But I'd have to magnify that thousands of times to explain the effect of the sound in heaven. It was the most beautiful and pleasant sound I'd ever heard. I saw a bright iridescence. I peered through the gate, yearning to see what lay beyond. It wasn't an anxious yearning, but, uh, a peaceful openness to experience all of the grace and joy of heaven. At that very moment I was about to realize the yearning of every human heart. I was in heaven and ready to go through the pearlescent gates. Then, just as suddenly as I'd arrived at the gates of heaven, I left there. I spent a lot of time in the hospital trying to make sense of all of this. I was paralyzed by the notion of not wanting to return. I mean, why come back to this much pain? I think now I know. I do too. I believe it's time for me to go back to church. I believe that too. Have you told anyone else about this? Yes. David. Are you hurt that I didn't tell you first? No. I feel elated to know, because it enables me to understand the man to whom I'm married. - Eva. - Yes? Eva. No one should have to do the things that you had to do for me. But you did them, faithfully, compassionately and without hesitation. You come closest to really knowing how painful this journey has been for me. Each day you endured it with me. Eva, you are my gift from God. I was so enthusiastic about finally returning to South Park. I hadn't been out of bed for more than an hour at a time and, well, I overestimated my endurance and suddenly felt incredibly fatigued. Yet, the... the overwhelming response from the congregation gave me a new burst of strength, and I knew right then that their praise was for God's work and my healing. It's only taken me... five months to get from the conference at Trinity Pines back to church? I may be slow, but I'm faithful. They would like for you to say something to the congregation. Eva, I think I made a mistake. I don't think I can do this. You can. I'm not sure if I'm ready. You are. Let's hear it, Don. Say something, Don, please. You prayed. I'm here. Oh, there he is. Hey, Don! Don! Hey! You made it. Yeah. It's so good to see you. I believe that I'm alive today because you prayed me back to Earth. Tell you what. You buy me lunch, we'll call it even. All right, it's a deal. That's right. I couldn't figure out how to get inside, so I just pried open the trunk, knocked down the backseat and crawled in that way. But even when I was praying with you, I didn't know it was you. Besides, no one lives through that. Hmm. Well, in my first moments of consciousness, two things stand out. - First, I was singing. I don't sing. No. "What a Friend We Have in Jesus. " And the second was that Dick had climbed into the car with me, and... and his hand had gripped mine and held it tight. But the one thing that is absolutely clear was Dick being in the car and praying with me. That's true. He did get in the car and prayed with you. But, Don, he never held your hand. - Nope. - I-I remember it so clearly though. It was one of the most vivid details. - It didn't happen. - It was physically impossible. There's just no physical way possible I could have reached your right hand. But... But I-I-I swear, I... Someone was holding your hand. But it wasn't Dick. Dick Onerecker was a real prayer warrior before and after the accident. He would pass away only a few years after praying for me on that bridge. Okay, you guys, right in here. - Hey, darlin'. - Yeah. Mm-hmm? I'll be right back. Okay. Boy, that really hurts, doesn't it? Yeah, it hurts very much. Yeah, I know. Believe me, I know. You do? Yeah. I had one too. It's horrible. Ah, it's... it's just horrible. It's awful. I know that. I wore one on my left leg for 11 months. Nobody ever understands. Well, they can't. It's not something you can talk about and have anyone understand your pain. I'm Don. Mark. Well, Mark, you just met someone who does understand the pain and the discouragement you're going through. I don't know if I'm gonna make it. Oh, you'll make it. You're gonna make it. Hey. Hey, trust me. You'll make it. What happened? I had a skiing accident. - You're a football player? - Yes, sir. I'm gonna tell you something. One day, you will walk again. Might not be playing football, but you'll walk. Here's my card. Number's right there. You can call me anytime, day or night, 24 hours a day. All right? Now, I'm gonna walk back over there to my family. I want you to watch me, and as you watch, I want you to do know that one day you will walk too. You'll probably do it better than I do. You met someone who understands. Give me a call, all right? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hey, it's not about me. Before I died on that bridge, I was unsure of what my purpose was. Now I see it more clearly. Ministering and sharing the hope I found. Over 25 years ago, that big truck took my life on that old bridge. I am not the man I used to be. I have been beaten up, but I'm not beaten. I have chosen to be not bitter, but better. And it is a choice. Every day of my life, I still ask the same question that I asked in that bed, that hospital bed, every day. Oh, Lord, why? Why did you let me see heaven and take it away from me? I believe it is so that I could be here with you today and tell you to your face, God still answers prayer. God is still in the miracle business today. God is able to help us find a new normal and overcome tragedy and loss, pain and suffering. And God is building us a better place. Heaven is real. I may not meet you here, this side of heaven. So my prayer for you today is, if I don't meet you here, one day, I want to see you there at the gates. And may God help us to be found faithful until that day.
