Goodbye, Mama. - Goodbye, Papa. - Goodbye, Carrie. - Say goodbye to sister Carrie. - Bye, Carrie. Goodbye, Maudie. Remember the things we said. All aboard. Let me help you with that. - Thank you. - Welcome. Were you visiting in Columbia City? - I live there. - No. Why, you look like you just stepped right off Michigan Boulevard. Did they tell you not to talk to strangers? Everybody's a stranger till you meet them. Almost got run over, didn't you? Allow me to introduce myself. "Drouet." My father was French. Charles S. Drouet. S for smiles. Charlie to his friends. That's engraved. That's nothing. Forget it. Rub your thumb over that. Go ahead. Keep it. I got plenty of them. Stick it in your bureau mirror with the dance programmes, picture postcards. Hey, let me show you a trick I learned my first year on the road. Minnie, my sister, went to Chicago without knowing a soul. Then she met Sven. He's in the stockyards. And they got married. Now she's got a little boy and a flat with gas and running water. - Did all right, huh? - Yes. You should see her letters. And you're off to do the same, huh? I can do better than Minnie. I went through school. Yeah. And looking like you do ain't gonna hurt any. South Chicago. That's not us. That's the slums. It's South Chicago. - It's where they told me to get off. - I don't know where you live. Goodbye, Mr Drouet. Here you are, Sven. Hello, Gussie. I walked home, La Salle Street. If it was to save the fare, you shouldn't. I told you you could take it out of the board money. - You'll scrub the skin off. - I wish I could. Minnie, I hate my job. I could be there 100 years and never have anything to show for it. I can't even buy a coat for winter. I haven't got what to stake you. If you want a stake, you gotta work for it. But no matter what you make, I gotta have $5 board money. They're always stacked high in front of you. Keep it moving. The light's so bad I can't see my fingers. Do you want to give up your machine? Take your foot off the pedal, you fool! Hold it there. Don't try to get it out. Don't pull. Turn that wheel slow. All right. There it is. Just went through the nail. Everybody back to your machines. Nothing serious. Wash the dirt off that and take the day off. - Stop at my desk on the way out. - Yes, sir. It ain't a bad one, Carrie. Here's a dollar. A whole day's pay. You can keep the change. Sign this release. Make an X if you can't write. I'll let you know when to come back. - You don't know where I live. - I'll find out. Hey, you, come over here. - Have you got an apron? - Yes, sir. Follow me. Want me to take you home? How can I go home? I'm fired. I've gotta find another job right away. Thank you, Anna. - He's coming right down. - Thank you. Oh, I know my apples But, girlie, you're a peach Oh, hello. Hello, Sally. Skidoo. Where you been keeping yourself? - At my sister's. - That a fact? I've been thinking about you, Sally, but I've been busier than a scalded dog. - My name's Carrie. Carrie Meeber. - Well, of course, Carrie. - I just wanted to see if you knew. - Mr Drouet... Charlie's the name, charm's the game. What's up? Would there be work in your company? - For you? - Yes. I lost my job this morning. No, they don't hire girls. I've been all over the city. I just can't find anything. You look pretty whipped, Carrie. This is not the girl that I saw on that train. I've been working in a shoe factory. I got my finger caught in the machine... - You did? - I just don't know what to do. Carrie, that's no work for you. - Does it hurt? - Not very much. Let me see it. Give me your hand. I wanna give you something. - Here's $10. - Oh, no. Take it. Buy yourself something nice to wear. You look for a job like that, they'll hand you a broom. - I could never pay it back. - Not if you don't take it, you can't. - I'll take half. - Never take half. This'll see you through till you get a job. I've got some things to finish up here before we close. Go home, wash your face. You got something else to wear? - Yes. - Put it on. We'll see Chicago tonight. Have you been to Fitzgerald's? I'm gonna buy you the best meal in town. Meet me there at seven. It's on Adams. Everybody knows it. Take a hack. Seven o'clock. You won't be able to work at the machines. Why weren't you more careful? What's Sven gonna say? It's all right. He didn't dock me. He gave me two weeks' salary in advance. Here. - I'm gonna give this to Sven tonight. - Where'd you get that? The boss gave it to me. My things. - Who brought them? - Anna Yankowski. You were fired. Who gave you the money, Carrie? You're going home tomorrow, Carrie. I didn't do anything wrong. It was a loan. - From a man? - Yes. Sven won't take that kind of money. If you do, you'll regret it all your life. Miss. Oh, miss. Out. Out, please. - Can I help you? - I don't know. - I'm supposed to meet someone. - Do you see him here? No. - He'll probably be in the restaurant. - There? But I don't think I'd walk through the bar if I were you. Oh, I'm sorry. The entrance is right next door. There you are. Thank you. A little thing like that kind of breaks the monotony. I'm sorry, we do not seat unescorted ladies, miss. I don't want to sit down. I want to leave a message. Yes. What is it? Well, would you tell Mr Drouet, Mr Charlie Drouet, that I couldn't come? That I can't meet him, and I couldn't wait to tell him. And if you'll give this back to him. - What is it, Louis? - I don't know. - Who were you meeting? - Mr Drouet, Charlie Drouet. - Let's see if he's here. - He isn't. I'm early. Well, maybe he's early. He should be. Shall we look? Well, it would be better if I could just leave this. - Were you going to have dinner here? - Yes, I was. Well, why don't you wait? - It's a very good restaurant. - I know. - It looks it. - Carrie. Hello. You got here early. - Good evening, Mr Hurstwood. - Mr Drouet, good evening. Say, you've got a good memory for names. I haven't been here in months. Will you follow me? Louis. - A nice table for Mr Drouet. - Thank you. This way, please. Try to be a sensible girl. Stop worrying. Put the money away. It's just a loan from a friend. I'm not gonna give it another thought. Buy yourself a little coat. You need a coat, don't you? There you are. Pay me back when you get a job. Anything wrong with that? Put that money away before the waiter picks it up. Look out. Now, then, that's settled. You've been awfully nice, Mr Drouet. Why not? Everybody gets a little help from somebody. Some of the finest ladies in Chicago are right here. Where do you think they get everything from? From their husbands. Or friends. No. The little one. That's the first time you smiled. Come on, let's enjoy this, will you? - No, I didn't order any champagne. - The compliments of Mr Hurstwood. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Now, isn't that nice? There's another smile. I wish you could see it. Here, look in the mirror. Do it again. There you are, right up there. Those two windows. You see? Now, why don't you come up and take one look? - I don't think I better. - I'll have the cabby wait. If you don't like it, you can come right back. I think I'll take a streetcar. To your sister's? You said they didn't want you. You don't wanna go back to the farm? You like Chicago. You wanna stay here, don't you? It's a nice little flat. It'll be empty for ten days. I'm going on the road. I can just as easy catch the 11 o'clock to Edison tonight. If you like it, move in. No board. Not a dime. By the time I get back, you'll be fine. Maybe you'll have a place of your own. Here's the key. Now you're making sense. - Thank you for everything. - It's nothing. Now, you wait right here. - Where are you going? - I gotta get my bag, don't I? Well, I'm all packed. Why don't you take your hat off, make yourself cosy? Hey, you're scared to death. - Yes, I am. - What for? I'll tell you what. Why don't I go out and get a couple of bottles of beer? We'll play the graphophone, make you feel better, huh? What do you say? All right. I'm going. I just thought I'd take a later train, that's all. No, I'm off. Goodnight. Take care of yourself. - Goodnight, Hurstwood. - Goodnight, Judge. Mr Hurstwood. Good evening. I wanna thank you for that bottle of wine you sent over. - Did you enjoy it? - Yes, very much. - Did the young lady enjoy it? - It was a brand-new experience for her. - Leaving town? - No. I'm just checking into the lmperial for a night or two. Maybe three. Care to join me in a nightcap? I'm leaving now. Some other time. Sure. Well? Drinks for the house. On me. Hello. Where do you live? Oh, there. Would you like an apple? No? What's your name? Haven't you got a name? Well, what is it? I'm not supposed to talk to you. Well. Sharp as a razor. If I thought I could swing it, I'd raise a moustache. How'd you like me with a moustache, Carrie? What's the matter? - When are you going to marry me? - When am I...? Well, any time, any time at all. You know that. People in the house... Everybody, they know. They talk about me. Well, I won't stand for that. - No, sir, we'll put a stop to that. - When? When? That's a question. That's what we gotta settle is when. Well, we can't get married today, can we? And we can't get married tomorrow, it's Saturday. I don't think next week. I leave town on Thursday. When I get back. What do you say? I'm going home to Minnie's. I'll tell her... I don't know what. But if you really wanna marry me, you come there for me, just like I was home with the family. Carrie, that's silly. Things are gonna straighten out. You just wait, you'll see. Everything's gonna be just the way you want it. - I'll bring you a present. - I won't be here. I'll bring it anyway. Come on, boy, here we go. Come on. That's the boy. Come on. Excuse me. Oh, Mr Hurstwood. Hello. Good to see you again. Oh, hello, Mr Drouet. What do you think of the wolf? Brand new. - I just named him Columbia. - Hail, Columbia. That's pretty good. It's for Columbia City, Missouri. - That's where Carrie came from. - Carrie? The girl that I brought in to dinner. Remember? - The girl who came in the wrong door. - You should see her now. - Are you going any place? - No, just walking. I live right here. Come up for a drink. Well, I... Come on. She'll be delighted to see you. Come on. I live right around the corner here. - Maybe this isn't convenient. - She'll be tickled to death to see you. There you are, sweetheart. You remember Mr Hurstwood. - How do you do? - I was just in the neighbourhood. Look at this. A companion for those lonely hours when I'm on the road. - I was just going home. - Carrie, no. Mr Hurstwood's an old friend of mine. It's all right. Sit down, George. There's some good bourbon there. Say, he's shivering. I'll put him on your bed, huh? Help yourself, George. You'll take great pleasure in the puppy, Mrs Drouet. Sometimes dogs can be more understanding than people. May I help myself to a glass of sherry? Yes. One for you? Yes, thank you. Trumps. - Mr Hurstwood, I'm losing. - Wait, Carrie. He's nervous. He doesn't know what we're going to do. - Is that so? - Well, play, Charlie, play. Triple with this one. If I'm not mistaken, that's it. Now... No, figure it out yourself. Of course, exactly. He didn't count, but you did. We'll give you the ten of diamonds and take the rest. Put them down. I'll be hornswoggled. - I won. - It took the two of you. I don't care, I won. - You like to win, don't you? - I do. She learned quickly. Didn't think she could do it. I think she could do anything. Charlie, I've had a fine evening. Thank you, partner. George, we want you to come back and see us again real soon, don't we, pet? Yes, Mr Hurstwood. We enjoyed having you very much. Thank you. Say, I've got two tickets for the theatre Friday night. - Why don't you use them? - Friday, I'll be in Duluth. Well, you keep them. You'll find someone to take. Thank you very much. When you get back, come to Fitzgerald's and be my guests for dinner. Say, isn't that nice? I'll buy you a new dress. Well, goodnight. Goodnight, Mr Hurstwood. George. Why don't you take her to the theatre? I don't mind. Well... I'll see you when you get back. - Goodnight, George. - Goodnight. Well, that's what I call a high-class fella. Knows the finest people in Chicago, spends the evening with us. What's the matter, didn't you like him? Yes, I liked him. I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, Jessica. Good evening, George. - Good evening, Julia, Jessica. - Hello, Father. - This is John Connell. - How do you do, sir? He brought Jessica home from the club. Club? The Thursday Cotillion of the Park Club, George. Oh, yes. Can I offer you a drink, John? No, thank you, sir. - Goodnight, Mr Hurstwood. Jessica. - Goodnight, John. - Goodnight, Mrs Hurstwood. - Goodnight, pet. Goodnight, Father. I wish you'd learn to sell your drinks at the bar and not here in your home. - What Connell is he? - They have the big house on the drive. - Yeah. - And Green Acres at Waukesha. - I know his father Slim Connell. - As a waiter knows him. They're one of the first families of Chicago and he's interested in Jessica. Jessica is 16. Jessica has got to meet the right people. You come in bowing and scraping. Show a little dignity. I offered the little pipsqueak a drink. What's undignified about that? Must you always remind everybody you're in the liquor business? You're not comfortable without a shaker or a bottle in your hand, are you? - Hello, Pop. - Hello, George. Now, you're not going out at this hour. Those friends of yours can hold up the side of the drugstore without you. - You've been fighting again. - No. How'd you make out today? Fine. I made the semi-finals. Won three straight sets. Six-four, eight-six, six-love. Good boy. Pop. I thought maybe... I'd like to meet some of the fellas. Go see the tennis coach about the match tomorrow. Don't put me in the middle, George. That was a lie, Pop. I don't wanna see the tennis coach. I've got a girl. What girl? Just a girl. She's awful pretty. You can see her tomorrow. But she's waiting for me. You're lucky. Go on. Thanks. Gee, thanks, Pop. - Oh, Mr Hurstwood. - Good afternoon. - How do you do? - I brought you a book. Thank you. The Complete Hoyle, for your protection. If Charlie thinks a king should take an ace, look in the book. - Is he home? - Charlie left for Duluth this morning. Oh, I thought he said he wasn't leaving until Friday. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Did you find someone to take to the theatre? No, there isn't anyone I can ask. - Would you ask me? - Why, yes. What have you there? A play they're doing at the club where Charlie belongs. - Do you play in it? - No, Charlie does. - He plays a friend of the duke. - That's Charlie, everybody's friend. - Does he carry a sword? - No, he wears a hat with a long feather. There's that. I guess that'll be just as deadly. Isn't there a part in it for a pretty girl? - Yes, there's Gwendolyn. - Is she very pretty? Yes, she's supposed to be. Why don't you try for it? I'd call that good casting. No, I'd be scared. Gwendolyn talks so... so nice. Besides, I've never even been to a theatre. - Maybe I could help you. - How? Well, let's see. First act. First scene. Mr Hurstwood, you were kind when you called me Mrs Drouet. I don't know what you... what Charlie said to you. - I don't know what you think of me. - I think you're very lovely. I try to behave as if I were Mrs Drouet. I will always behave that way. Thank you for the book and for coming to call on us. I've offended you. I'm deeply sorry. I've forgotten how to behave. Charlie and I will always be glad to see you, Mr Hurstwood. Thank you. And will you forgive me? Yes. May I still take you to the theatre Friday... ...as Mrs Drouet? Thank you. "Thank you, no" or "thank you, yes"? Yes. It's Mr Fitzgerald. He's in the office. - Put a bottle of Mumms on ice for me. - Yes, sir. Good evening, Mr Fitz. Hello, George. - Much of a crowd after dinner? - I suppose average. I went to a theatre. Saw a fine show. Camille. - With Julia? - No. How is Julia? - Fine. - Well, I'm glad to hear it. I've been in every night this week and haven't found you once. Does it look as if business was suffering? I didn't mean it that way. I thought perhaps something was wrong at home. Nothing wronger than usual. Count your blessings one by one, then you'll see what the Lord has done. Here are your blessings. Would you like to lock them up? George, what is it you want? What are you looking for? Everything. I don't like to hear that kind of talk from a man your age. It's dangerous. Nobody has everything. You've got as much as anybody I know. A nice home, good position as long as you want it, two fine children. And after all, Julia's a sterling wife. Wait. I want to put something in my compartment. Been playing poker, Mr Fitz? Say, this is set for 11 o'clock. Fitz, I never need cash before 11 in the morning. All right. Sometimes it does a lot of good to talk things over with an older and wiser head. Want to walk me home? - There's nothing to talk about. - George. That Camille... That isn't a burlesque show, is it? No, Fitz. No, it isn't. Well... a man in the liquor business can't be too careful. Goodnight. Goodnight. Franklin and Pine. Excuse me. I didn't know it was taken. Franklin and Pine. Never mind, Joe. - Were you lonesome? - Yes. Good. So was I. George. Mr Hurstwood. George. During the play, I looked at you once and your eyes were filled with tears. Of course, I cried like a baby. I always do at Camille. Carrie. Why didn't she tell him the truth? Then he wouldn't have left her... ...and maybe she wouldn't have died. Carrie, I've got to see you again. I don't know. Does he come home tomorrow? - Yes. - What will happen to me? I can never thank you enough. What for? The happiest week of my life? Does it end? Do you love him, Carrie? When you're poor, it gets all mixed up. You like the people who are good to you. Do you love him? Carrie. I want you more than I ever wanted anything in my life. I should have waited until I met you. But I didn't, and now I'm not free. Will you meet me tomorrow? How can I? He's coming in on the morning train from Duluth. What time? He'll be here by 11. Carrie... don't leave me. I must. - Is that clock right? - Just about. - Why can't it be exact? - Yes, sir. - Put oil on that. - Yes, sir. - Morning. - Morning, Mr Brant. - Little rye. - Yes, sir. - That was quite a train wreck. - Where? Out in Seattle. Worst wreck they've had in years. Western Express jumped the track on a curve. This paper says there are four dead and 20 injured. - Gus, come in here a minute. - Yes, sir. I want you to go out to Ogden Avenue with a note. - You've got to be there before 11. - Very well, sir. Hi. Here I am. The weary traveller, home to his castle. - Did you miss me? - Hello, Charlie. Did I miss you! But not too much. A waitress in the American House in Rocky Falls thought your Charlie was just about it. I was only teasing. No, she wouldn't stand a chance. - Charlie, I've got to go out. - What for? I just got in. - My sister. I've got to see her. - Something wrong? - I don't know. I'll find out. - Wait a minute. What's up? Who's important, Minnie or the master? - I'll go with you. - No. All right, but meet me for lunch, 12.30? - Yes. - All right. Fitzgerald's. Couldn't we go some other place? Sure. Where? - I don't know. - Fine. Fitzgerald's at 12.30. Am I gonna pack it in! I've been eating Indian food. Baked dog. I got presents for you. Silk things. Wow! - You came. - Did you think I wouldn't? I didn't know. I didn't know if you'd want to enough. I wanted to. There. Now you're all right. - Did he get back? - Yes. I can't live without you. You know that, don't you? I don't want you to live without me. Carrie... leave him. Come with me, will you? Yes. Say you love me. I love you with all my heart. I want to say something to you and then never talk about it again, George. - What is it? - About Charlie. I'm so ashamed of the way I've lived. That's over, Carrie. We don't have to talk about it, ever. But I promise you, I'll be an honest, decent wife to you. Carrie... ...I may have to go away Saturday. Will you come with me? Yes. Carrie... Yes? What is it, George? Trust me, my darling. I do. - Do you? - Of course I do. - I have to go now. - To meet Charlie? Yes, at your place. - Well, how's your sister? - Fine. Fine? It was nothing. That's good. - You hungry? - No, thank you. Well, we'll see what they got. How about a lake trout? - Yes. Yes, it is. - Is what? Yes, it's good that there's nothing wrong with her. Minnie. Hello, George. Well, let's see. What about...? An omelette? - George... - Who? - Charlie. - That's right. Charlie's the name. Jealousy's the game. You been seeing a lot of that fella? I have something to tell you. Look, I got something to tell you. He's just a little too nice for us. I don't like married men to be too nice to my girl. He's all right. There's nothing wrong with him. Just watch it. - He's not married. - Of course he's married. Carrie. He's not married. For years. He's got kids. Everybody knows that. - I thought I told you. - You lie. Excuse me, sir. Mrs Hurstwood is in the restaurant. Thank you. Well, Julia, are you joining me for lunch? I've had my lunch. But I will have a drink. Whisky. I'll join Mrs Hurstwood. - Bourbon. - Yes, sir. Well, what brings you downtown? A young woman. What? The one you took to Lincoln Park on Tuesday. And took to the theatre three times last week. And went boating with on Sunday. Let me go free, Julia. I'll give you anything you want. What have you got to give? Everything you own is in my name. You're in no bargaining position. Then why are you here? To make sure that you behave yourself. If you see her one more time, I'll go to Mr Fitzgerald. Thank you. Will you give her up? I'm not like you, Julia. I don't make threats, and I don't make promises. Well, I make them. And I keep them. Frank, did Mrs Hurstwood stop at this table on her way in? I don't know, sir. I was about to take their order and they left. Mr Hurstwood. There's a cabby here wants to see you, sir. - Mr Hurstwood? - Yes. I've got a fare out here wants a word with you. A young lady. Carrie. What's wrong? - Is it true? - Is what true? Your wife? Your children? - Carrie. - It's true. Every word of it is true. - Drive away. - No, wait. Let me tell you. Look at me. Nothing's changed. Nothing. I love you. Look at me and see that. I see that you lied to me, and I see why. - You thought me dirty and cheap. - No, my darling. But I'm not. Will you get off? Carrie, listen to me, darling. Will you let me go now? - Where's Mrs Hurstwood? - She's upstairs. She's resting. What did you say to her? What are you doing home at this hour? - How dare you hound her! - What are you talking about? - Don't lie to me. - I didn't see her. Did you tell her she was breaking up a happy marriage? Why didn't you tell her the truth? That you've nothing but contempt for me. - Keep away! - You bled me for money. You schemed until everything I've got is in your name. - That's all you wanted out of me. - I tell you, I didn't see her! You must be losing your mind. - Now, get out of my room. - You listen to me. I have found somebody who loves me, and I'm going to have that before I die. - Not if it harms me. I won't let you. - You can't stop me. Nobody can. The children, what are you going to tell them? Everything. They're grown up. They want to live and love just as I do. Get a divorce. You've got all the evidence and money you need. But this much happiness I'm going to have. You've had about enough, Mr Drouet. I'm waiting for your boss. - We're going to close up. - Close up. Come on, fill it up. No, I'm not leaving town. I'm just locked out for a day or two. - Where's Carrie? - Where she belongs. - Is she at her sister's? - No. Don't you know you're out? The double-cross is over. Just rack up a try for yourself. A low-down, sneaky try. All right, Mike, put it on the desk. - This isn't what you think it is. - No? Well, you're a polished gentleman. I'm not. I'm just a guy selling bolt goods. I wouldn't know what gentlemen like you think this is. You tell me. I love her. What right have you got to love her? What can you do for her? Lock her up some place while you sneak around town so your wife won't see? I'm gonna marry her. Tomorrow. The gentleman is buying the wine. Can I mix you a nice nightcap before I go? No, thanks, Mike. George. Hello, Fitz. I'm glad you're here. As I was closing the safe... I didn't come to talk business. I'm here at your wife's request. - For your own good. - I'll handle this. - It's none of your business. - It's very much my business. You manage the most respectable emporium in Chicago. That's how you've got to act. I saw this coming. You're in the hands of an unscrupulous woman. You're an old man, Fitz. Don't. I am going to pay your salary to Julia during this unfortunate phase. If you have no more money to spend on this woman, she'll soon sell her favours somewhere else. Cabby! Cabby! 657 Ogden. Wait here. - Who is it? - It's me. - Carrie, please. - Go away. I've got to tell you something. I must see you. Please. I'll never see you again. Never. Please go away. Carrie, you... You don't understand. It's about Drouet. He's been hurt. Do you hear me, Carrie? Charlie is hurt. He wants to see you. - Where is he? - In the hospital. I'll get dressed. Wait. Union Station. - Where is he? - He's just outside Chicago. Quick, we have to catch a train. Driver, hurry. How did he get out there? I don't know. How did it happen? - Is he badly hurt? - No, I don't think so. Well, how did you find out? A telegram. That's all I know. You'll make better time on La Salle Street. Pillows, sir? - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. We are going to see Charlie... ...aren't we? What? - Where are you taking me? - I'll tell you if you'll be quiet. We'll be in Englewood soon. You can get off there. I won't stop you. Then all that about Charlie, that was just another lie. Yes. I have to tell you something before you walk out of my life, and this was the only way I could think of. I lied to you about my wife, my family and my intentions. I knew you'd never see me again if you knew the truth. I never will. You think I lied to you because I held you cheap. That's wrong. I couldn't risk losing you. I love you so much. - Darling, I will always love you. - Englewood. Next stop. Englewood. This could be a beginning for us. We can have everything in life and have it together, as man and wife. That's not true! Carrie. I have no wife. We're rid of each other at last. As of tonight, I'm free. A free man. - How can you be? - She'll get a divorce. She needed evidence. Now she has it, she can get it. This is just what she's been waiting for. We can marry right away, just as soon as we get to New York. Trust me. I've gambled on your loving me. If you don't, Carrie, you must get off now. But if you do... If you do love me... All aboard. All aboard. - What's the matter? - Columbia. - What? - My dog. I left him. He'll be all right. He'll look for me. He'll want to follow me. It's a long walk to New York for a little dog. Carrie. Did you nap? No, I couldn't. I've been looking out the window. - What have you been doing? - I've been out on business bent. I went to the post office, and then I went to a couple of little restaurants, snooping, and then I decided I needed a new hat. We're going to the theatre, and I want to look my best. - Is it a nice hat? - Madame Louise thought so. Who? Oh, George. - It's not for me. - Well, it's not for me. Put it on. No, my hair isn't right. Wait a minute. Are you happy, my Carrie? Happy? George, look at me. Look at where we are. I'm Mrs George Hurstwood of New York City. Mr Hurstwood? You're a hard man to find. My name is Allen. Western Bonding Company. How much have you got left? This is a personal matter between Mr Fitzgerald and myself. And me. Mr Fitzgerald has my personal note for the amount. I consider it a loan. And we consider it grand larceny. I'm so sorry. Here's your note. Unacceptable. - Why? - No collateral. I've got $18,000 in the banks in Chicago. I have stocks. I've got my house... We tried to get it out of your wife. She'll see you rot in jail, Hurstwood. How much have you got left? I have an opportunity to buy into a business. In a year, I could refund. - Has she got it? - Who? You know... - I have 6,000. - Out of ten? No. Let's go and meet the desk sergeant. I'll see that Fitzgerald gets every cent. But you're no better than a burglar, and I've gotta take you in. If you tell me you've blown a few hundred and come up with the bulk, I'll listen. Take your time. Good evening, sir. Well? - I have 9,000. - And how many hundreds? - Three. - Five? - I told you, three. - 9300. Go get it. - Will you wait here? - That's pretty good. No, I'll go with you. I get lonesome. This is Mr Allen, Carrie. - How do? - How do you do, Mr Allen? Is it under the rug? - I'll be right back. - Won't you sit down, Mr Allen? I would, but I... I'm as nervous as a cat. No back doors, fire escapes or ropes. Say, it's a nice little nest you got here. Are you connected with the hotel? Yeah. We're enjoying our stay here. Yeah. My home office figured that. - Here are the papers. - Fine. Let's take a look. Outside, Mr Allen, please. He might be sending me home with a Bell telephone book. Well, you've still got your health. And... I'll give you a receipt, just to keep it honest. Of course, this isn't generally known. - Is it? - The theft? A couple of fellas in Medicine Hat don't know about it. Any robbery over $1,000, we automatically inform all our clients. You ought to know that. You ran a first-class restaurant. We bond about every place like it in the country. Say, tell me, I'm just curious. Why does a fella like you do a thing like that? The receipt. Cigar? No offence. Just trying to be social. Goodbye. I didn't like him very much. Who was he, George? Was he laughing at me? George? Just stand there. George. George, what is it? Who was that man? What's the matter? George, you must tell me. I want to. Carrie, do you love me very much? Of course I do. - What are you worried about? - About that. An awful lot depends on it now. Why? I'm broke. Darling, I thought something really terrible had happened. Will you stay with me and trust me? Will you go on loving me? Why, we're married. I'm your wife. Carrie, that's not enough. - Are you sorry you married me? - Darling. Try to understand it, darling. We've got less than $50. I owed a lot of money in Chicago. I paid it back today. - To Mr Allen? - Yes. But I'm still rich. I've got my love for you. It's you I fear for. What have you got? I've got you, George. You'll have a fine position in no time. I'll look for a cheap apartment tomorrow. We'll manage. You'll see. - Have I the time... - All our lives, my darling. ...to start again? Pick 'em up, Gus. - More butter here, Jack. - Butter. Listen, I'm handling four tables. You know where the butter is. All right, Jack. All right. Eight-fifty, $8.75, $9. Nine dollars and ten cents. That's $1.80... Eighty. $1.80 each. Funny thing about head waiters, the things they won't pick up and the things they will. Hey, Rockefeller. I wanna talk to you. Hey, George. For Mr Slawson. You never told me you worked for Fitzgerald's in Chicago. Well, I'll have to let you go. I guess you know why. - Give me that ball. - No, I got it first. Bobbie, come here this minute or you know what you'll get. I'm home, Carrie. - Where are you? - I'm in here, George. - How's my girl? - Fine. - How are you? - Fine. We had a very good lunch trade today. I'm glad. - What did you do? - I walked over to Gramercy Park. They have a fence around it and it's locked. It's only for the neighbours. But it's lovely. Nurses and children there. We'll live in a neighbourhood like that. We won't stay here for ever. I didn't mean that. - There must be a hole in it. - I took two dollars. I had to. I paid our bill at the grocery, and gave Mr Blum a little for the cleaning. You're so quick to pay them. Let them wait. They can't wait. They need the money just as much as we do. I can't buy food and things and not pay for them. It's not honest. - What do you mean? - It's like stealing. Shut up! Carrie. Carrie, darling. I'm sorry. - Carrie, please listen to me. - What is it? I'm desperate. I've got to get out of this. If I could get $1,000 saved, to get out of this, to get a place of my own. If it was mine, I could build it into something. How can we save $1,000 out of what you make? I did it once. I bought a house. I raised children. I lived well. - Nobody lived better. - Stop talking about the past. What good is it? Let's take what comes, but let's not worry so. Take this? Live like this? George. Will you do me a favour? Will you go to the store for me? I'll get your coat. Get a bottle of milk, your newspaper and a cigar. Carrie. You're wonderful, Carrie. Hello? Hello? - Mrs Oransky? - Yes? - Can I come over? - Sure. - Hello. - Hello, Carrie. - Can I take her out? - Sure. - Did you have the baby in this flat? - Sure. Him too. - Did it cost a lot of money? - For what? I don't know. Doctors, clothes. No. You? That's fine. Ought to be very pretty baby. If I was back home, I'd know more about what to do. - Is it very different here in the city? - It's the same all over. You keep them cool in the summer and warm in the winter. They get along. George? Are you back? - Where were you? - Sit with me a moment. I got mud on my trousers. I washed it off. - I want to tell you something. - It's drying. Sit down a minute. I'm going to have a child. In about six months. Carrie. Don't worry, darling, I feel wonderful. Really, I do. My darling. Is something burning, George? Carrie. Carrie. What have I done? - It's all right, I can patch it. - Patch? How can I wear a patch? What have I done? Two dishwashers. - You. Got your quarter? - Yes, sir. No credit. You gotta have a quarter. If you haven't, get out. You. That's all. Young man? Could I buy that from you? - For how much? - Would a 10-cent profit interest you? I been waiting in there all morning. These things are hard to get. Yes, I know, but I need a day's work very badly. I have a wife, with a child coming. It's a sad story. We'll keep it strictly commercial. Would you take 50 cents for it? Yeah, I'll take 50. I'm Mrs Hurstwood. This is Mr O'Brien. - How do you...? - Is Mr Hurstwood here? No, he isn't. - When do you expect him? - Why, I expect him any minute. I'll wait. - Good afternoon. - Hello, Mr... - Mr O'Brien. - Mr Hurstwood, I trust you're well. Yes. - Have you met...? - Yes. I think we had better get right to the business. Yes. You see, Mr Hurstwood, your son is thinking of getting married. Is he? Do I know the girl? Get on with it, Mr O'Brien. Yes. My client has had a handsome offer for her house. It is her desire to sell and take up residence in a modern apartment hotel. Your signature would permit her to do so. - I have the papers all made out. - Thank you. Eleven thousand dollars. That would be $5,500 each. Well... ...my client had not contemplated any division. Your client wants to sell a house which is our joint property. To do so, she must have my signature. That's the law. To get my signature, she must give me half of what we own. If he doesn't sign that paper now, Mr O'Brien, I'll send him to jail on a charge of bigamy. Bigamy? I thought you were going to be prettier. You... You got your divorce. He told me you got your divorce a year ago. - I will never divorce him. - You've got to. You've got to. Make her, George. Make her. Mrs Hurstwood, I understand your feelings. But in a practical sense, you can't make him sign. You want that money, and jail won't get it for you. Well? I think a settlement. A portion of it, a small portion. I'd offer him $2,500. All right. I'll make a bargain with you, Julia. You always liked a bargain. How much will you take, Mr Hurstwood? Give me an immediate divorce and I'll do anything you want. We'll institute proceedings at once. Sign right there, Mr Hurstwood. Carrie? Carrie? She's sleeping. The doctor gave her something. - What's the matter with her? - She'll be all right. Is she hurt? You know, she lost the baby. Let her alone for a while. I'll be across the hall if you want me. George? How do you feel? I was in the kitchen and I... I know. I know. It's best. Believe me, dearest, it's for the best. They take a great deal of care. I know. We don't want to bring a child into this. You're glad, aren't you? No, Carrie. We'll have a baby when we can. When it's all right. When? When we're rich? When you own a great big restaurant? When you're 80? Carrie, don't. Don't be angry. I'm going to stop this slide, you'll see. It won't go on like this. It can't. At my age, when you're out of work, people think there's something wrong with you. That just makes it a little harder, that's all. When I get the chance, I'll be better than ever. You believe that, don't you? I can't advise you, George. But I know one thing. I'm still young. And I'm going to live. Somehow. - Oh, look. - All right. Mediums. Mediums only. I said mediums. Now, you walk right across the stage. Heads up. You stop in the centre so Mr Goodman can get a look at... No grandmothers. We need dancers here. Let's see. Go ahead. You flash a smile out front and form a line. Now you. Any experience? Yes, I've been in several plays in Chicago. - What did you play? - Camille. - What's your name? - Carrie... ...Madenda. - All right, Camille. - This fills it, Mr Goodman. I'll keep a couple of pretty ones around. Some of these might be flat-footed. The rehearsal call is nine tomorrow morning. Be on time. You gotta be on time for the next four weeks. Can you do that? - Yes. - Good. The show opens Monday, November 4th. Good luck and thank you all. - Thank you. - That means we have it? May I walk you home, Miss Madenda? George. Did you see the show? I saw a lighted stage and one person on it. You didn't tell me you had a speaking part. If you can call it that. Two lines. You did it very well. And you looked beautiful. The best part about it is I got a raise. It's $18 a week now. You can support me in luxury. I just had a little luck, George. That's the only difference between us. You ought to push your luck and play it for all it's worth. You ought to have good clothes and a nice place to live. You can make your way up into that other world, Carrie. The one I left. - You mean alone? - You're never alone up there. It's down here where it's lonesome. - Morning, George. - Good morning. Listen to this, Carrie. "Among the passengers arriving on the newly equipped S.S. Coronia "are Mr and Mrs George Hurstwood Jr. "Mrs Hurstwood was Ellen Palmerston, daughter of Edgar Palmerston, "founder of the Palmerston Plough Company "and chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. "The young couple will live at Lakeview, on the Palmerston estate." That's my son. We were very close once. He's a fine boy. Would you like to go and see him? Well... ...I don't know. What do you think? I've got your other shirt washed. I could iron it for you. It's a long time since he saw me. I guess we're both changed. You look fine, George. It might be that you and I could even go back to Chicago. - Leave me out of it for a while. - Why? Well, he must have heard terrible things about me. I won't leave you out of anything. He's a man in love himself now. He'll understand everything I've done. This is a chance to get help. Take it. No matter what else happens, George, take it. We'll see. If things work out all right, you can send for me later. You'll be with me. George. Kiss me, George. Goodbye. Goodbye. Good luck. Ellen! George! Oh, Ellen, darling. - You look wonderful. - Glad to see you. Is there anything you can tell me that's a little bit more colourful? Our Sunday readers like personal touches. We've got the dull stuff. Two seasons in New York, one year on the road. Your favourite food, fights with the director, romantic interests? I can't think of any. Miss Madenda, there's a gentleman to see you from Chicago. Curtain in five minutes. Is it you? It is. - Charlie's the name. - Charm's the game. Thanks. I can get a story out of this. - Look in the Sunday Globe. - Thank you, Mr Calhoun. - Not a scar. - No. What a long, long way. You look lovely. You're successful, you're taller, prettier, younger, happier. Sit down, Charlie. As for me, I eat five meals a day, have 150 neckties, and you're the greatest thing I've seen since the Flatiron Building. - How are you? - I'm fine. Where do you live now? I got a great big new apartment now. Lot of snappy furniture. But it never looked as nice as that Ogden Avenue flat when you were in it. - I'm glad you're prosperous. - Come out after for a bite and a bottle. Will you? No, thank you, Charlie. I learned to order a dinner just as good as Hurstwood. Say, did he ever marry you, Carrie? Yes. Well, there you are. When I heard he grabbed you and that money and blew town, I doffed my derby to him. What a guy. Two minutes. - Did he ever get work here? - Of course. Why wouldn't he? It's pretty hard to keep a thing like that a secret. - Keep what a secret? - You kidding me? If you're trying to belittle him, it's contemptible. Don't get mad at me. I stuck up for him. I kept defending him when everybody in Chicago said he was a... common thief. I knew why he stole the money. He'd have done anything to get you. He did. - George stole money? - You didn't know? You're the only one who didn't. It was in all the Chicago papers. He opened Fitzgerald's safe for $10,000 the night you and he left. If anybody ever burned his bridges, he sure did. So that was why. If they hadn't picked him up before he spent it, they'd have put him away. After that, of course, he was a marked man. That was why he never got a job. Had no friends. Never found help. You've gotta pay the fiddler in this world. I don't care how much he loved you. I ruined him. Curtain, Miss Madenda. I ruined him. Thank you. Please wait. Hello, Mrs Oransky. - I'm Carrie. - Yeah. I know. Carrie. From over there. Remember? Sure, I remember you. This is a coal-oil heater. I thought maybe you could use it. It's good. It's new. They're all right. You selling them? No. It's a present for you. I want to give it to you. Hello. Hello, Annie. You don't remember me, do you? - How has she been? - All right. Come in. When did you last see my husband? Not since the landlord threw him out. A month or so after you left him. I didn't leave him. He was going back to Chicago. I don't think he could have got there. He wasn't in such good shape. No. Mr Blum was telling me he kept seeing him for a while. He went in to get his dirty clothes pressed. And he looked terrible. Are you really looking for him, Carrie? Yes. Go see Mr Blum. He might know. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. He must live someplace. Look, you're happy, aren't you? You're doing good. You're well out of it. - If he's all right, he don't need you. - But if he isn't? If he isn't, he wouldn't thank you to see him. Seven o'clock. All out. Seven o'clock. All out. Seven o'clock. All out. Where are you going with that blanket? I've only been out of the city hospital for two days. They told me I should rest up. Seven o'clock. All out. All right, come on, you... Come on. Excuse me. Are you all right, bud? Yes, Officer. I'm going to see a friend for help. - I'm all right. - All right. I've got to eat or I'll die. Who are you talking to, me or God? - Goodnight, John. - Goodnight, Dolly. - Goodnight, Carrie. - Goodnight, Dolly. Excuse me, Carrie. George? Where are you? I tried very hard not to do this. George, I've looked so for you. I need help. Just tonight. I need a little help. I'm... ...hungry. Could you spare me a little something? Spare? Anything. I don't want to bother you. I won't again, but just tonight. Come with me. John. Get food. That Italian place will be open. Bring something hot. George. What happened to you? In heaven's name, what happened? I've... I've forgotten. Did I do this? - Did I? - Carrie... ...l'm here for a handout. Don't make me live through too much to get it. This is very generous. I'll make it up to you. Will you let me? I'll have trouble changing that. George, I left you to be safe and secure. Now that I am, make it worth something to me. Let me share it with you. George, look at me. I know a lot more now. I know what you did. I know how much you loved me. I want that again. Let me have it back. Let me bring you back. I can. Don't live in the past. Remember? I was too young. I didn't realise. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you make me understand? You still have time, Carrie. Move on now. Find someone to love. It's a great experience. Carrie. Could you get that changed now? We'll need more money than that. I'll see if Mr Amos is still in his office. You rest there. John will be right back with the food. Then I'll take you home with me. And tomorrow we'll get you some clothes. Thank you... Carrie.
