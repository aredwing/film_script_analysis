He perceived they served a higher calling, a calling he felt stirring within him. Percival asked his mother permission to journey to King Arthur's court and seek knighthood. His mother had long-feared this moment would come," Sailor. "Nonetheless, she gave her son blessing to pursue his quest. But she warned him, he would be tested beyond imagination. Be deprived, know pain and sadness. Perhaps, never become a knight. Percival traveled to King Arthur's court. There, he met rebuke and ridicule. For he was not of noble birth, nor did he possess skill of arms. In secret, he studied the ways of the knights. His plight caught the eye of Sir Lancelot who began to mentor him. During Percival's ordeal, the Red Knight an incarnate of darkness, sought to destroy the Grail. He lay waste to King Arthur's knights, one by one. Finally, it fell upon slender Percival to face the Red Knight." And Sailor, "Percival had no fear." Get up, Sailor! "His years of hardship had taught him how to suffer. He was ready in body, mind and spirit. He would prove in life or death, his worthiness in battle. Percival went forth with joy in his heart. For this was what he wanted: to be an instrument of peace. To be able to sacrifice all in service of God and man." Lead with your right, kid! Lay on him. Lay on him! - Get away from him. - Let him go, let him go. Let's see some blood! Work the body! Kill him, Sailor! - Come on, let him go. - Let's see some blood! You got him, kid! Take him down! You gotta throw back here, let's go. Break it up, boy. Break it up! Stop the haymakers. Stop the haymakers! Double up. Another fight, then, is it? Once more into the fray. Once more into the fray. You're a silly man. - It's okay, Mom. - No, it's not okay. - I'm not gonna get hurt. - Yes, you will. You're too old. - I'm in good shape. - No, you're still old. I got one or two fights left in me, right, Ma? No, you are used up and broken. I've never been knocked down. Heh. See, that's why you're broken. A man should know when to go down. You don't. You never did. I never should have said it to you. Said what? That I want to go to Ireland before it comes. You didn't, I did. You are such a liar. Anyways, loser's purse will cover it. Oh. I see you're aiming high. Father Brennan wants to talk to you. About what? And don't say God. About what's coming. I'm not afraid. You should pass in a state of grace, Ma. You still believe, don't you? Yeah, I do. How can you after what he did to you? Only a monster takes the innocent. If there is a God, it's a monster. A doer of evil and wicked things. I will not seek grace from a monster, nor will a monster give it. Will you talk to Father Brennan? Maybe. If he takes off his robes and shoves a crucifix up his arse. Maybe. Nice, Ma. - I'll ask him, see what he says. - Good. Have you gone to see Albright? Will he be there with you? - He can't be there. - Why not? He's busy at Safe Hope. - I see. - He's a good man. If he was a good man, he would talk you out of this fight. No one's gonna talk me out of the fight, Ma. - Lay it on, Sailor! - You've already got the game! It's all you, Sailor. Come on! Use your jab, man. Use your jab. Come on, man. Come on! Come on. Back to your corners, guys, let's go. - You're done. - Yeah. Hey, kid. Get over here. Come on, sit down. Sailor! Sailor! All right, come on, sit down. You ain't got all day. Come on. Sailor! Sailor! Sailor! You wanna make it 10 rounds, you gotta listen to me. You're dropping your right hand, like that. Keep your head on his shoulder. - Can't you do that? - Yeah. It's time for you to put this old man down now. You do it now, hear? - Yes, sir. - No more fooling around. That's enough of this nonsense. You're young, man, and fast. Put him down so we can go home, all right? Let's take a look, Sailor. How's that eye? - Good, doc. It's good. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - All right. That opens up anymore, I'm gonna stop the fight. - I'll do my best, doc. - Do the best you can. Oh, great. Hey, King's fine. You check that old man over there. - He ain't so fine. - Back off, Cubby. - Looking better than Sailor. - I'm fine. Didn't think you could take a punch. - I can take a punch. - You're proving it, kid. You're gonna get up close so you can do some damage, okay? Concentrate. I wanna have it. You don't know what that means. Yes, I do. - No, you don't. - It means work. It means money. - I can make money. - How? Well, I can box. And I have some modeling jobs too. We're too young. - Too young for what? - To have a baby. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't. - I wanna marry you. I wanna marry you right now. This morning. And I'll take care of you and our baby. I promise you that. We have a family. I've never had that before. Me neither. Let's have our baby. Okay. Okay. Okay. But, King... I wanna give this baby something besides life. What? I wanna give it something it can be proud of. You keep him at a distance with that jab. You dance around, huh? That man throws some wild hooks, you know? Duck. Stop. You cannot win a fight laying on a guy, okay? So let's win it. You cannot outmuscle this kid. You cannot outfight him and you can't outrun him. But you outweigh him and you can outthink him. You wanna win it? - Yeah. - You're the heavier one, lay on him. Keep your head on the right side of him. Let the kid get cocky. Listen to me. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? What the hell's the matter? You wanna win the fight? Keep your head on that right shoulder. Once you get that rhythm, setup, he drops down, you cross him, okay? Cubby. And what's this I hear about King? I'm gonna give the kid another chance. - King is a screwup. - No, no, he's all cleaned up now. - The kid does have talent. Real talent. - Yeah, he's always had talent. I poured a lot of money into him, and you gotta have it to go with that talent. - Yeah, well, he's going to have a baby. - There's a disaster waiting to happen. He got married to a nice, young girl. He was my fighter before you stole him from me. I did not steal him. Hey, look. You've got that night coming up at the Lion Head? - Yeah. - I want you to get King a fight there. - Maybe as an undercard. - No, no, no, main event. - What? Look, King is no main event. - Yes, he is. I'll put up the purse, man. Ten-thousand dollars. Ten rounds. You really think he has his head on straight? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. All right, I'll take a piece of him. No, no, no. Ha, ha. He doesn't like you. - I'll take 50 percent of him. - He's not for sale. Hey, look, you know he was my fighter before you took him. I didn't steal him. Hey, you know why all your fighters leave you, man? Huh? - Because you steal them from me. - Yeah. Same reason why your wife left you. The same reason why I left you. Just give me a piece of the kid. Hey, look. You line up something for King, hm? Someone the kid could handle, huh? More than just a warm body, but somebody he could beat, huh? I want it kept local. I don't wanna bear the expense of bringing somebody in here. What about Charlie Simms? No, he's in prison. Armed robbery. Teddy Bigfoot? Teddy Bigfoot? Teddy Bigfoot, man, he's a lot of Bigfoot. Man, he's 350 pounds now. - Bigfoot, yeah. - Yeah. Hey. How about Sailor O'Connor? - Sailor? - Yeah. Is he still fighting? No, but it might not really matter. I mean, if I could get him to take one more fight. - People loved him. - Yeah, yeah, he was very popular. Everybody wanted to see if he was gonna get knocked down. - Yeah. - And every fighter wanted to be the first. That's a good hook, man. Yeah, that'd be big if King could knock Sailor down. Heh. - That's good. - Yeah. I'm gonna run it by King. - I'll talk to Sailor. - Yup. - Hey, I want a piece of the kid. - Not going to happen, man. - Well, we'll see. - Yeah, yeah. Why should we bother to go see the doctor? What's there to talk about? If you're dying, you're dying. I know I'm dying. How do you know? Tell me you wouldn't know if you were rotting from the inside out. It's cancer. Cancer, rot, no difference. Ma... Aw. Don't get all melancholy on me. I think it'd be good if you and I went and saw a doctor together. - Yeah, well, you go see him if you want. - Ma, there may be some pain. How long did he say I have? - Ma. - Oh, don't be such a baby. How long did he say I have? Six months. I'm sorry. Sorry for what? No one's getting out alive. Is there anything I can do for you? Well, it might be nice to take one last trip to Ireland before it comes. That'd be nice. Maybe you and me. Yeah. King, come on. Go box. Go box! Let's go home. She's been in for five years. She's asked me to be there - for her parole hearing. - You gonna go? I don't know. I've gotten to know her a lot better through the letters that she sent me. She wants to speak with you if she gets out. I can't do that. You can try. Sean, I don't have it in me. Sailor, her loss is as great as yours. Is it? I'm sorry. Loss can't be measured. No. No, it can't. Do you want her to continue to suffer? Do you want her to continue to suffer? Yeah. I think I do. Don't you think she's suffered enough? Sean, I thought we agreed, you can't measure suffering. Do you have no pity for her? You know, my ma has a saying about pity: Pity arrests the heart and unites it with those who have wronged us. I need to go see Rose. Won't do any good, she's at war with God. Yeah. You taking confessions today, Father? You have nothing to confess, other than what we just talked about. Yes. I'm remorseful, yes. And I know what that means, really means. I violated the most basic and primary of relationships. Destroyed the lives that were entrusted to me. I'm a ghost. Haunting of what's left of life, until there is no life. But the pain I suffer is nothing compared to the pain I caused. Quit pushing. Quit pushing there, King. - We shouldn't have let him do this. - It's done. Forget it. Thank you again for seeing me. The mayor has got an election coming up, and he would really love to have your support. Thanks. Well, you tell him to come see me himself. Well, you know, the mayor, he's... He's a very busy man. Oh. Oh, Well... Heh. Thank God. Thank God that I have absolutely nothing to do. And the truth is, I don't believe in politics. You don't? Well, what do you believe in, then? I believe in, um, the luxuries of life. Food, shelter, clothing. You know? You tell your mayor that and then tell him come and talk to me. Okay? We need some more bread over here. Okay, come on. What's on your mind? - I got a fight coming up. - You got a what? A fight. A fight? I thought we left it all behind. It's just one fight. You feeling some need to get punished because I'll take a hammer and beat you with it, if that's what you'd like. - No. - Well, then why? Do you feel you gotta prove something to somebody? - Huh? - No. No. So why? I miss it. Okay, well, I mean, you know, I miss it too. But I don't miss getting my face busted up. Mikey, it ain't the same for me. What ain't the same? Life. Life as a civilian. So... So, um, when you get in the ring, you feel more civilized, is that it? It's the fight I know. Well, there's just... There's a lot of fights out there, a lot of them. I mean, if that's what you want, we got a lot. We can find them. I'm suited to this one. Well, I could argue that. Your record ain't that good, you know. Heh. I'm sorry, but it's the truth. Even when I lost, I knew who I was. I was a fighter. All right, look, let's just cut the bullshit. I, um... I mean, bottom line is, I really don't want you to fight again, okay? I'd like you in my corner. I can't, man. I just can't do that. Well, help me get ready. I can't do that either. You've always been there with me. I always will be. But I don't have to be there and watch you get destroyed. - I've never been knocked down. - Well, that's great. That's great. We'll keep it like that, okay? All right. Just... Just one more. One more fight. No. Because I love you, man, I do. I love you and I do not see the need. - I told you the need. - You didn't tell me shit! What'd you tell me? "I didn't get knocked down." What, do you wanna prolong this, or extend this stupid, idiotic legacy you got? That's what you told me. I can't do this without you. Please, man, just don't do this to me, okay? I need your help on this. Jesus. I just... I just can't. I just... I just can't. Take his head off, King! Come on, ref. Come on, let him go. Let him go. Come on, old man! Kill him, Sailor! Finish him off, King! Oh... You gotta punch back or we'll stop it. You're getting schooled, Sailor! Once more into the fray. Sailor! What you doing here, Eddie? I wanna talk. - About what? - A fight. Look, do you wanna fight? I haven't had a fight in four years. That's a long time. Look, it doesn't matter. You got a reputation. Sixty-three fights, never knocked down. That's right. Yeah, and a lot of people would pay to just see something knock you down. Come on, Sailor, you don't tell me you don't miss it. Yeah, I miss it. Who would I be fighting? He's a kid. His name is King Soloman. Never heard of him. Cubby likes him. Oh, he's with Cubby. How is Cubby? He's good. But, look, I used to have this kid, and he's gonna be mine before the fight. What about you? You got management? Does it look like I got management? I could line you up with some stuff. I don't think so. This kid good? He's a pretty good fighter. Look, he's got nice moves, but he can't take a punch. I think you could beat him. Look, you go out on a win. That's the way to go out. Worst-case scenario, loser's purse is 2 grand. Four. Four what? Four thousand. - Three. - Four. Come on, when's the last time you made 4 grand for a fight? - Hm. Never. - Exactly. Eddie, you're a good promoter. You'll make a lot of money out of this. Four thousand. All right, deal. Four grand. The right! Over the top with the left hook! Come on, Sailor, keep your hands up. Good time? Ha-ha-ha. Hm? Hm? King? Baby, that you? I can hear you. King! Baby boy? Yeah, Mama? Come here. Baby, where you been? Mama miss you. With Peg. She giving you money or are you free fucking her? I just came to get my stuff, Mama. I'm leaving. Leaving where? Here. You're just like him. You're just like your father. Nope. No, I'm not at all. Yeah, you are. You're a fucking taker. You just fucking take and take and take. I used to be something. I used to have a face. I used to have tits. I did it all for you. Now what do I got, King? Now what do I got? I don't know. Look at this fucking shit hole. You gonna go and see... Bobby? That modeling stuff. That's good. Bobby will take care of you. I'm never coming back, Mama. You'll be back. You'll be back. You'll be back. You're lucky, old man. - We love you, Sailor! - Go back to your corner. Come on, guys, get back to your corners. Come on! Come on! Come on! Don't get too cocky, boy. He got knocked out. What do you want? Wanted to talk a minute. You mind if I don't listen? Well, yeah. I been watching you, and you're looking pretty good. You're training hard, showing discipline. I like what I see. I'm just glad I put you on the card at the Lion Head. Cubby got me on that card. No, I did. And I could put you on bigger cards than Cubby can. I'm with Cubby. You used to be with me. Used to be. You owe me, and you know it. Look, I could take you places that Cubby can't. You want real fights and real purses, right? I hear you got a family coming, and you wanna take care of them the best way you can. You're gonna need money for that. You don't wanna end up being a deadbeat nigger dad. Heh. I never will be. That's good. You know, this fight is important to you. If you can knock down Sailor, you got a name for yourself. No one has ever knocked him down. I'm not gonna knock him down. I'm gonna knock him the fuck out. Yeah. See, I like that enthusiasm. Heh. You know, you're gonna win a lot of money in this game. You just gotta be with the right person who knows how to play it. And you do, right? What can I say? I'm with Cubby. Think about it. I'll give you money to train, money to live on. And I'll move you up quick. All you gotta do is leave Cubby after the fight. I'm with Cubby. Don't be stupid. All right. Be stupid. And I'll tell you what. You're not worth my time or my money. - Sailor, how you doing? - He's doing great, thanks. I'm talking to Sailor. You don't look good. - How many fingers? - Two. How many fingers? - Two. - He said two. Boxes like that again, takes a shit-kicking like that, I'm stopping the fight. Do me a favor, I gotta do something here. - Mike, I'll stop the fight. - I gotcha. Go fuck yourself. Gordo! Gordo! - We need to stop the fight. - Father, sit down. - You need to stop this fight, Gordo. - Father. - Please, just stop the fight. - Father, sit down. Please, we know how this is gonna end, Gordo. Double up on the left hand. Double up on left. - Keep busy on him. Don't lay on him. - Yeah. - Make him push you. Wear him out. - Yeah. You're letting that old man shame you. Disgusting. You're young, strong and fast. Disgusting. Bobby, what do you want us to do today? Yo, King, baby. You're late. It's time to take off your clothes and get that dick hard. Am I right? Am I right? What is it, King? What is it? What's the matter? You need a fluffer? Come on, buddy. You got two hot chicks here for you, let's go. Come on. Let's do this, huh? - Can't do this. - What do you mean, you can't? It's only gonna take about an hour. I already paid your mom the money. She's your problem. What are you doing, King? King, you're killing me here, buddy. You're killing me! ...you go down. You work on your jab, all right? Hey, hey. Good. You got to remember what I told you. You got to close up your stance a little bit so you have balance, huh? What are you doing here? I need a fight. I need to make some money. You can make money other ways. - I like fighting. - Ah, nobody sane likes fighting. I'm sane, and I like it and I'm good. But you can't take a punch. I can take a punch. I just don't like to. Ah. That's sane. Get me a fight. Please. What do you want that money for? Drugs? - No, that's over. - Are you sure? It's over. My girl is pregnant. I mean, my wife is pregnant. - You married? - Yup. You're an idiot. - How old are you now? Nineteen? - Twenty. Twenty. Oh. And how old is she? What's her name? Peg. She's 18. Ah... Babies having babies. She's gonna be a good mom, I know she is. She's gonna be a good mom and you're gonna be a good daddy, right? Yeah. Cubby, I can fight. I can be somebody. Go be somebody with somebody else, and let me be. Huh? You know I can fight. I don't know if you have the heart or the head. Just give me a shot. You had your shot! You know what you did before, huh? I'm sorry about before. I know I disappointed you. - I... I didn't know better. - You got that right. Can you please just give me another chance? Hey! You watch your stance, huh? You gotta put your left... I told you not to be so wide, huh? Close up your stance, and you keep your left in his face, huh? Hey, kid! King! You are not going to flake out on me this time, are you? Hm? - No. - Are you gonna stick to it? Train? Come to the gym on time? Yeah, I promise. You know... You know I got talent. Yeah, but are you willing to put in the hard yards? Give me a fight, you'll see. Hey. If you fail me this time... Hey, look at me. If you fail me this time, it's over. Huh? You got it? - I got it. - All right. Now, this is against my better judgment, but I will give you a fight. All right? Thanks, Cubby. It won't be much. That's okay, I just... I just need something to get me going again. Let's go, box! Use your jab! Get those hands low, Sailor, let's go. Break it up! Take the old man out, King! Put him in the hospital, King! Head butt, really? That's how you gonna fight? Huh? Huh? You ain't know how to box! - You're a boxer, let's go. - This is dirty boxing. - Get to your corners. - I apologize. Let me see your head. Let me see your head! All right. All right. You know Sailor's got a fight coming up. Yeah, yeah, I know. He can't do it. No. But I'll bet you're gonna be in his corner though, right? What am I gonna do? It's Sailor. "What am I gonna do?" I mean, you could try talking to him. - Did you? - Yes, I did. You know what this is all about. Well, I don't know. He told me he missed it. Yeah, well, that's all well and good, but it's his mother. His mom's dying. Huh. That's kind of inconvenient for her. Rose wants to visit the old country again before she passes. He gets 4 grand, even if he loses. Yeah, but, I mean, you and I could put up that money for him, and... - He wouldn't take it. - You tried already? I offered him money. I said, "All you gotta do, come by the shop a couple times a week. Tell stories to the guys." And he goes, "No, I don't take handouts." Are you a religious man? Why do you ask? Oh, just to see if you reside in that papas camp of blind obedience. Well, no, no, I'm not especially religious. But they call you Brother Albright. Ah, yeah, well... That's down at the harbor, it's more of a term of affection. You know? "Hey, brother, hey, bro." You know, that's all. What do you do down there? We're just a group of people that do service. Service? Service, you know, helping others in need. - Well, that's much better than religion. - Yes. Ahem. You know that, um... Yeah, thanks. ...Sailor has another fight lined up. I know. And he wants me to be in the corner. He said you couldn't do it. Probably more correct is you don't want to do it. That would be correct. - You don't want him to fight, do you? - No, no, no. - And I don't suppose you do either. - No, certainly not. God only knows why his brains aren't scrambled. Look, um, Rose, I, uh... I hope I'm not talking out of turn here, but Max told me that the reason he's taking the fight is because he wants to take you to Ireland. No need to be delicate. He wants to take me to Ireland before I die. I got it, but... see, the thing is that Max and I could easily, easily cover that trip. No. Sailor would never go for it, nor would I. But I would appreciate it if you and Max would be in my boy's corner. You gonna be at the fight? No. I've never seen one of Sailor's fights. Never will. Sixty-four fights. This will be his 64th fight. My boy has a terrible record, doesn't he? Yes, ma'am, he does. Ha, ha. But the man has never been down. Never. But you see, a man should know when to go down. A man should know when to quit. Yes, you think he should. But, your boy... I mean, the guy is, um... I just never seen anything like it. I mean, I thought I was tough, but I'm... I'm like Tinker Bell or something. I mean... I mean, I see him get hit with, uh... With hammers, with... I mean, and... It would kill an elephant. He just will not go down. I just don't believe it and I don't get it. Yeah, well... When he was a little boy, about 10, we were driving in the car. His father had been drinking. He started hitting me hard. Keep my mouth shut? Yes, your mouth shut. - Our boy's in the back... - Unh! - Dad! - You think I don't know the kid's in the backseat? You... You need help. You know what I need? For you to shut up! Dad! - Get off! - Sailor. Get off! His father slammed his head against the side window so hard, it cracked the glass. Sailor passed out. George hit me some more and then he threw us both out of the car. When Sailor came to, we were at the side of the road. It wasn't your fault. My face was a mess. Are you okay? He said he was okay, but he really wasn't. He knocked you out, Sailor. Sailor vowed it would never happen again. Maybe that's it. I don't know. Or maybe he's just got a stupid Irish head made of pig iron. But my boy's got sand. That's for sure. Yes, he does. Um, what happened to your husband? I don't know. He left the day it happened. I never saw him again. Never heard from him. - Sorry. - Oh. There's no need to be. Please just be in my boy's corner. Yes, ma'am. Max and I will be. And you tell him when it's time, you got that? You tell him when it's time. Because... Well, Sailor just doesn't know. - I'm fine! - King, let's have a look at that. I'm fine! You check him! Okay, that's clock. Aw... Come on, you're standing like an ape. Come on! - Quick on your feet, Sailor! - Double up the left hand, baby. Come on, boy! Hurry up now! Double that up, baby. That's it. Now, watch out for that. Break it up! Break it up! Come on, Sailor! Come on, King! You're getting schooled, Sailor! Break it up. Come on, break it up! Grab him. Come on. Knock him out! Let's go home, boy. - Break it up, guys. - Hit him again. You got him, King! Take him down! Hey, come on, guys. Back to your corners. Let's go! Get going! Put him out of his misery! Come on, King! Sit the fuck down. Stop, come here. Come on, Sailor! Get the kid! Let me have a look at you here. You're letting that old man beat you! - Get me a mirror. - You don't need no mirror. Not now. - Send him to his grave! - Put him in the hospital, King! - Hey. - Hi. Are you okay? - I couldn't... - It's okay, I'm a doctor. How far? Fourth month. Okay. We should get you out of here. We need to get you in an ambulance. Come on. Come with me. It's okay. Come on. Hey. That old man is messing you up pretty good. You gonna let him get away with that? What you smiling about? You got nothing to smile about. I never liked being pretty. You ain't pretty no more. Best not to take any chances. King Soloman's my baby's daddy. - The young guy fighting? - Yeah. We just got married. I don't have a ring yet, but he says he's gonna get me a nice one - after he wins the fight. - Oh, that's good. That's good. Why are you here? Sailor O'Connor, the guy your husband's fighting. - The old guy. - Yeah. What's your name? - Peg. - Peg, I'm Diane. Mm. You got kids with Sailor? They are going crazy with the presents. No. Not with Sailor. - Are you the lady that phoned 911? - Yes. - What's the problem? - Preterm contractions. She's in her second trimester. Do you have a heart monitor? - Are you a doctor? Okay. - Yes. You don't need to do this, okay? There's no need to go on. We can end this with dignity. You understand? With dignity. Look. Come on, Sailor, come on! Fight back! Come on! Fight back, you little wuss. Come on! Come on, come on! Fight back! Get up, Sailor. Get up, you little wuss, get up! Get up. Get up! Get up! You don't need to do this. There's no need to go on. You done yourself real good. You should be proud. You made me damn proud. You're doing great. There's no shame in throwing in the towel. You still got the record. You still haven't gone down. - We can... I don't wanna do this. - We can do this, Mike. What for? You still got... You haven't gone down yet. - I ain't going down, Mike. - Well, if you go down, you might not get up, okay? And if you go down, I think I'll kick your ass. - All right. - All right. I love you, Mike. - I'm telling you, the last one... - Mike. I love you, Mike. I love you too. Okay, tough guy. Normal sinus rhythm, hemodynamically stable. Peg, if this were me, I would go to the hospital just for some extra testing, okay? I'm okay. Really, I'm... I gotta see the end of the fight. I must say, Rose, I'm a tad uncomfortable. What? Sitting in the home of a woman who despises your God? I have a crucifix up my arse. Those were the conditions under which you agreed to meet me, hm? You know, a man in your profession shouldn't joke about having something up your butt. Sorry. Quite right. Do you know the old limerick? Which limerick would that be? The altar boy, the altar boy The dirty little beast He filled his ass with broken glass And circumcised the priest That's a sad commentary on what's befallen the most noble calling. How do you handle such things? Such things? Well, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. You know, a priest once told me, he tied his hands up with his rosary every night before he went to bed so he couldn't masturbate while sleeping. And why did he tell you that? I was a young girl at the time. - I cut a bit of a skirt, I did in my day. - No doubt. I think he wanted to get up under that skirt. Just wanted to talk sexy and try and get me going. Ah. Tell me, you're a relatively young, seemingly virile man, who I'm assuming has all parts yet fully functioning. Yes, as far as I know. Oh, mores the pity, then. Rose, I'm just a little embarrassed here. - I'm not here to talk about my sex life. - Ha. Well, here's hoping there's something to talk about. Rose, um, Sailor's quite concerned about you. Sailor should be concerned about himself. You know what he's gone and done, don't you? You're talking about the fight. - Is that what you're calling it? - What are you calling it? - My son is an old man. - No, he's not that old. - He's... - No. He's old and you know it. This won't be a fight. Sure, it will be. He's very tough, he's in terrific shape. You know why he's taking it, don't you? Yes. He wants to take you to Ireland. One more visit for you. That's not it. He may think that's it, but it's not. What do you think the reason is? Guilt. Guilt? About...? Being alive. Come on, King! Finish him off, King! Rock the body! You can do it! Take the old man out, King! Break it up, guys. Break it up. Let's go. - Send him to his grave! - Put him in the hospital, King! How much? How much wrong can a person do before...? Before they've used up whatever good is inside them? I mean... What I did... Diane... God... can be far worse than us. He can do more damage, cause more pain and suffering, provide us with more temptation than anything in the universe and yet, we sin, and he doesn't. I'm not quite sure how that works. I have nothing. How do I go on? You need to learn to surrender. You got him, King! Take him down! - Jab. Jab him! - Break it up! Break it up, guys. Break it up. You got him, Sailor. He's tired! Sailor. Sailor, this boxing is a younger man's sport, always has been, and you're not as young as you used to be. Now, you're strong as a bull, but if you're taking this fight to make the money to take Rose to Ireland, there are other ways. Bake sales. Yo, old-timer! Hey! You know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna knock you the fuck out. That's who I am. Yeah. I know who you are. I hope you punish me. I hope you knock me down, I really do. And I hope you knock some sense into this old man. That would be my wish. Let me ask you something. Do you have kids? - No, you're too young. - I have one on the way. That's a beautiful thing. It really is. Right, Sean? Yes, it is. You know, I held my son as he took his final breath. I didn't have an answer for him. I will do my best, as will you. Now, get the fuck out of here. No, stop! You okay? How long? Five years, 11 months, 27 days. So... how did you come to this? Bad relationship? Did anyone tell you about the three rings of a relationship? Engagement ring, a wedding ring and the suffering. Sorry. Bad joke. It's what I did. What you did? What we do is never really done. What you got in that glass, it won't help. It's not the answer. You know that. Because we all been there. Thank you. I, uh... I need to talk to you. Talk to him. Sailor, I... - I came here because... - Diane. You were deceitful... without the slightest consideration. A mother. A monster. I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. You knew you were sick. Why didn't you seek help? Help was around you every day. Why? Why didn't you seek help? And now that you're better, you want my forgiveness. No. Diane, Diane. Please, get out of here. I will spend the rest of my life trying to make up for what I did, for the pain I caused you. Caused my family. I see the hate in your eyes. I deserve it. You don't. With each breath I take, I... I hate myself enough for the both of us. I'm not... I'm not asking for forgiveness. Contrary to the teachings of your faith, there... There are things that are unforgivable. But I will not have you consumed by hate. So you... You pray to your God for your loss, for your salvation, and for theirs. You ask him to help you find a way out of your hate. But don't you ever pray for me. I don't deserve it. Come on, son. You're gonna be late. - Use your jab. Use your jab. - Break that glass jaw, Sailor. Take the old man out, King! Kill him, Sailor! Don't box if you can't win a boxing match! Pauly. Come on. We're gonna be late. What you got there? How about some ice cream after church? Rinse that mug. Rinse it good. Sailor, look at me. You okay? All right, ladies and gentlemen! How are you enjoying the fight tonight? Well, I think these boys have suffered enough, don't you? So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna offer them a new prize. - Twelve grand to the loser. - Boo! Two grand more than the winner's purse. What do you say? What do you say, Sailor? Hey, get him out of the ring! Get that piece of shit out of there! That's the biggest purse of your life. All you gotta do is lie down, and the money's yours. Get out of the ring. Get out of here. Sit down, sit down, sit down. What's wrong with you? No! Oh, my gosh! What about you, King? I hear you got a baby coming soon. All you gotta do is just lie down. Yeah. Now I know you are a loser. - Twelve thousand dollars to the loser. - Hey, hey. Don't do this, Eddie. Don't do this. Do not do this. Yeah, you wanna mess up the kid's career, huh? You're jealous because you lost the purse. You lost him. You'll never get him back. - Twelve thousand to your loser! - Get him out of here! Get him out of my face! You're a piece of shit! I'm done with you all! I'm out of here. Let's pray. Father in heaven, please protect Brother Sailor tonight. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. And protect Brother King tonight, as well. - Amen. - Amen. Hold on for a second. Hey. Everything's gonna be okay. We're a family. You go, baby boy. You got this fight. You've won it. You've won the fight, man. Don't do anything stupid. Gotta knock him down. All right. If you want to knock him down, you work on his body. God knows what his head is made of, but it sure ain't skin and bone. Gotta knock him down. You kill the body and the head dies. You hear me? Kill the body and the head will die. All right. - You all right? - Yeah. It's time, kid. Hey, hey. I want you to know that I'm proud of what you've become, boy. Okay, let's go, guys. Sailor. That's enough, bud. That's enough, that's enough. You're getting schooled, Sailor! Get outside that left foot! Outside the left foot! Put him in the hospital, King! Put him down! Break it up, guys. Come on. - Hey! - Sailor, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Back to your corner, let's go. Hey, you okay? I shat myself. All right, Sailor, stay standing. I got it. Hey, hey, clean towels, now. Hey, look. He lost his mud. The Sailor lost his mud, man. The Sailor's gonna go down. For the first time in history, that Sailor's gonna go down. Now is your shot, man. Now is your shot. You go get him. Get on him. - This is your shot. For life. - Shut up! You're doing good, buddy. It's all over, okay? - One more. - It's all over. - One more round. - Your kidneys are gone. What is the matter with you? What are you, nuts? What's the point? You couldn't beat this guy with a baseball bat, okay? You got another L in the column. Big deal. You're still standing, right? You never been down. What is the point? I swore on my ma's head I would never quit, Mikey. - I promised. - You're good to go, Sailor. We'll let the doc decide. You sit. Hey, Gordy, you bring the doc, please? Look at me. Sailor. - Sailor, look at me. You okay? - I'm good, doc. You're taking too many shots. I'm gonna stop it. One more round, doc, please. One more round. Albright, what do you think? I got no opinion. Last round, doc, last round, please. I hope I don't hate myself later for this. - You won't. - Ref, watch him close. - Knock him on his butt! - Shut up! - You gonna be famous, man. - Shut up! - What do you mean, shut up? - Shut up! This is your turn, man. I don't care what you say, you get your butt up there and put the Sailor down! All right, Sailor. All right. I'm gonna be okay, Mike. I promise. I promise. I love you. Last round! Last round. - Come on. - Come on, guys. - Seconds out. - Let's go home! Get outside that left foot. Use your jab, use your jab! Last round, guys, let's go. Box! Come on, old man! One punch, Sailor! Come on, bud, one punch! Quick on your feet, Sailor! Stay on his right shoulder! Stay on his right shoulder! You're getting schooled, Sailor! Break it up. Break it up, boy! Break it up! - Double that up, baby. - Get away from him. Sailor, grab him! Grab him! Give me the towel. Put him down! Put him down! Oh! Do it, kid. Do it. Oh! Okay, let's go. Take the old man out, King! Let him go, King. Let him go, man. Ref, leave him alone! Leave him alone! - I got you. - He's taking him to the bell. We got this. Let him go. Drop him. Ladies and gentlemen! It's a unanimous decision. The winner is King Soloman! I'm proud of you. Good fight. You're a good kid. You know what? You're the toughest son of a bitch I know. Thank you. Yeah, you're also the dumbest son of a bitch I know. Go see your girl. I love you. The... The best we can do... is to forgive ourselves. Diane. You're not alone.
