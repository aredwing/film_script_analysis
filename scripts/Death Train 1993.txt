The United Nations Anti-Crime Organization... Responds to nuclear terrorism. So when Karl Leitzig, a German physicist, used this stolen plutonium to construct two nuclear bombs, his creations became UNACO's nightmare. Dr. Leitzig's "gadgets," as we call them, utilized components smuggled out of the former Soviet Union... Highly restricted components supplied by a renegade Russian general and assembled under his supervision with the utmost German craftsmanship. You see, the Russian general needed two bombs to change the course of world events. And Dr. Leitzig needed a job. It was the ideal partnership, until... Benin... your Soviet garbage. I am irradiated! Your neutron gun... I was testing it and it ruptured! And the bomb? What about it? They're gonna pull a lot of overtime. Well? I can't release your car without agricultural inspection. Yo! Radio for clearance... now. Okay, let's go! Control... Track 18, engine 4402, ready for departure. Out, out! Get out! Get out. Out! Come on! Come on, sit down! Move it, sit! Now, move! Stop there! Shut up! Nein! Nein! Shut up or you're all dead! Shut it! Be careful. Whoo! There's only one kind of bunny rabbit I slow down for. Uh-huh. Would've gone for roadkill, but rabbit's not in season. You're buying. Okay, yes. Thank you. Hey.- Hey. Anything shakin'?- No, nothing for us. Mmm.- Did you hear about Philpott? No. Baa! Broke his wrist at lunch. Oh no!-Yep. You did it? No! Boxing at the Harlem Athletic Club. There's something for your evening. 4402, track 18... Slow to upcoming siderail to allow northbound passing. Listen, this is 4402. We don't slow for anyone. I've got a dozen of your people and I want the tracks cleared to Stuttgart, got it? Who is this?-Your worst nightmare. Northbound 1507... Emergency... slow for spur. Slow for spur! I am switching you in 500 meters. We don't flinch. Shit, Alex. Alex! That was close. They've just found two bodies in Bremen railyard. 4402, what do you want? I want your complete attention, your undying cooperation and your first-born. And I want a clear route to Stuttgart, or I start killing hostages. Do you understand me? The route's yours. Thank you. Sabrina, hey, check this out. Bremen again. Two in a row in a sleepy town. Find out the train's cargo. Yes. Will you please inform your commander-in-chief that UNACO's broad range of power has been sanctioned by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council? And... No, just the freedom to run my own operations. Look, could I get back to you, please? Thank you so much. Goodbye. Diplomats. Wouldn't that imply diplomacy? Ours is a strange language, Sahib. You better see what's going on. I trust this is not another attempt to get yourself out in the field, Ms. Carver? Actually, I was just on my way out. After that phone call, some of us may be joining you. The Germans have a hijacked train moving from Bremen to Stuttgart. And possibly unrelated, a plutonium theft nearby. 12 hostages, two dead male employees. There's been radio communication with the hijackers. Let's request a tape recorder, Ms. Sanchez. Run a voiceprint. How much plutonium? Don't know. Let's pray it's not a trigger quantity. Right now, these are strictly German problems. You know how they are. What if the train crosses a border? Will we take over? Wishful thinking, Ms. Carver. I can switch him anywhere you want, but he might not want to go. He's on our train, he will go where I send him. Give me a spur line. There's a long one coming up out of Rohrsen. Send him there. Franz, what was that? I think we left the main line. Yeah, we damn well have. I know where we're going. You stop this thing. They know. They're stopping. No matter, my men are there. You... you should have had a coronary by now, anyhow. Come on. Come on. Come on. You want to do it? Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein! Open the door! A hostage has been executed. Do you like that? Clear me to Stuttgart. You jerk me again, and two die. Now this screen's directly linked to the Bremen police. How's the voiceprint coming? Mmm, no criminal record on this clown... so far. Isn't that a Midwestern accent? Hmm. Where's he going? Nobody seems to know how much plutonium's been taken. What's that? Damn. That's a direct link to Bremen's incoming data. Where did that originate? New York here. Leitzig. He's the department head who smuggled out the plutonium. But that's highly classified. They don't knowi ts source, but they sure want to know if it's for real. Ms. Sanchez, prepare a review of all available field agents. Sounds good! Sounds real good. Do you hear the phone? It's your ears ringing. Why don't I get the phone? Hello? Michael? It's Malcolm Philpott. Huh?! Ho-hold on! That's better. Who's this? It's Malcolm Philpott. Phil, man! How are you? I can't complain. Michael, is that the sound of bluegrass I hear in your voice, instead of Eton? Ahh, locals still call me "the Brit." Of course, not to my face. Of course. Well, Michael, it's been a while. Uh-huh. You're not going to remind me of... Laos? Do I need to? Phil, Phil, Phil, please, listen. I've been working on this bike for over a year now for Daytona. Qualifying's tomorrow. Would I call in a favor unless I needed it? What's that? I can't hear you! I can't hear what you're saying! Say that again? Then turn her off! Look, Phil, why don't I get back to you in a couple of days, okay? Michael, Europe will be gone! Oh, really? Yes! There'll be a private jet waiting at the Lexington Airport. Where are we headed? First New York and then Munich. Bring work clothes. And Michael, after this, we'll be even on Laos. Was that your ex-wife? Worse. Okay, it's confirmed. No other law enforcement or news agency received that mysterious bomb message on their computers. No point in frightening half of Europe before they finish breakfast. Keep searching, Ms. Sanchez. That there, yes. He's new... Rodenko. Another Russian? Politics we leave at home. The major happens to be a former railway engineer... our only one. So, Rodenko: Whitlock, physicist: Kolchinsky, combat chopper pilot: and Graham. Who's Graham? He's a former business associate from my SAS days. That will fill the bill. However, I do foresee the need for an information analyst, expert marksman, linguist. Sir? Get packed. Yes! Oh, man! I see you made it. I just sat back and sipped mint juleps. Hey, how are you, buddy?! Good to see you again! Good. What did you do, fall out of your easy chair? The noble art. Let me guess... You should see the other guy! Oh, yeah! Oh my, what have we got here? Your secretary?- No. You old fart. Your girlfriend? No. Your teammate. No. Sir... hey've completed the radio patch to the hijackers. Splendid. Hello? Hello, is someone there? If you can hear me, I would like you to look upon me as your mediator. My goal is to help resolve your problems. How Christian. If you... care to look at it that way. By the way, my name is Malcolm Philpott, what's yours? Uh... Elvis Presley. Look, when I get to Stuttgart, we'll talk then, all right, Malcolm? Look, just because plutonium's been taken and a phantom message says there's a bomb, doesn't mean that there is. The message mentioned Leitzig and the stolen reactor waste. Why bother to build it? Why not buy one off the Ukrainians or the Chinese? Perhaps it is an end run... The least likely source. We have to assume it's for real. Is that so? Then why doesn't he just fly it there? It's a lot faster. Maybe... maybe... Maybe he's afraid of flying. Right. Phil, can I have a word with you for a minute? Now, look, I'm not questioning your judgment, but she's kind of iffy. You are questioning my judgment. Okay, it's just that we're going into a situation, I like to know I can count on people. Meaning? She's too good looking to be anything more than window dressing. Michael, Ms. Carver speaks four languages, she runs a mile faster than you ever did. She's the best marksman I've ever known. Mm-hmm, on a range. What about combat? That's why you're here. If you don't think there's a bomb, why not get the train's radiation signature from a military satellite? Good idea, Sabrina. Satellite report... Elevated radiation levels in the first car confirm the presence of fissionable material on the train. There.- Mm-hmm. At least it's not a wild goose chase, huh? Is he slowing? No. Now what? You are the UN observers? Malcolm Philpott, UNACO. U.N. Anti-Crime unit. You can observe from over there. Excuse me, what is your name? Captain Wolfe. Captain Wolfe, I understand your reluctance to relinquish command, but if you confer with your superiors, you'll find that I have been authorized to lead this response. Since when do you people tell a German anything on his own soil? Since 2:00 a.m. Are you running the board? Yes, sir. Route him on line 42, through the country. These are German hostages. It is our problem. Ms. Carver, patch me through to New York. There is a crucial bit of information that you don't know. What information? Hold those people. What information? The hijackers may have an atomic bomb on the train. May I speak to Hauptmann Wolfe? Herr Major.-Yeah. Hauptmann Wolfe. Er ist ein Englander. Philpott. Ja, Herr Major. Ja, ja. Thank you. Major Rodenko, Lieutenant Kolchinsky, I'm Malcolm Philpott. Welcome. Sir, we're uplinked. Major Gennadi Rodenko. Sabrina Carver. There will be no calls without my authorization. I was just calling my wife to let her know. Yes. Look, let me make this very clear. No one will know about this bomb. You will talk to no one, you will not leave this room unless I approve it. We're in a state of martial law here, and I'm the marshal. Welcome to the West. And we're his deputies. Idiot! German drivers... damn. Dr. Whitlock?-Yes? Hi, I'm Dr. Petersen, Chief of Surgery. Good to meet you. Well? Carl Leitzig is highly irradiated. He has extensive DNA breakdown. He received over 2000 rems. How long's he got? Perhaps 48 hours. Ah, hell. Rosie, you got to look past your bank account. I never trust banks, Alex. This isn't about money, it's about patriotism. See, I'm an American. I love my country. America's lost right now. See, we define ourselves by who we hate, right? And no matter what you say, the USSR was a very worthy opponent. 'Cause of this new world order thing, can't use that. No, once you know who you hate, everything works. Yeah? You handled your first obstacle well. Yeah, right... you got to let 'em know who's boss. Now we adjust our procedure. I will initiate all telephone contact with you. I will keep you informed. Yeah, right. I'm C.W. Whitlock, physicist. I've never made an atomic bomb, but I've wondered if I could. It's demanding, isn't it? Where's the train? Past Stuttgart. Where's it going? I'll just hang out here for a while, okay? Of course the German government are happy to let them chug on until they reach Switzerland, but the Swiss are demanding action before they reach the border. A wise idea, sir. Excuse me. The hijackers just received a phone call from Munich. We didn't expect it... Missed getting anything. Damn it. I hope you're tuned in now. Yes.-Good. So... Ms. Carver, stay with us. It is to be gas somatol. Subdues motor reflexes for about two hours. I would recommend it. Phil, sleeping gas and the public don't mix too well together. Sigi, any unpopulated areas before Zurich? Only one... the train will be there in 40 minutes. Good. Excellent. The German military have agreed to back us. You'll fly Michael and the major. Yes, sir. Are you familiar with the M203?- Very. We'll use that grenade launcher to crack some gas into the locomotive. Wait a second... she's going to shoot gas canisters into a train going 70 miles an hour? Yes, she is. We've got a situation here that could make Chernobyl look like a pop gun, and she's point man? Point person.- Hey! Now, enough. She has backup, sir? Yes, you... helicopter launch rockets. - Yay! - All right, Phil. Michael?- Mm-hmm? You can't call me Phil in this group. What do you want me to call you? "Sir" would be appropriate. All right. Let's do it. Don't let the boys' club bother you. What if I miss?-You can't. C.W.- Malcolm. You've been boxing with the brothers again? I told you about that. You all right? I'm fine. How's Leitzig? He's dying, but he's got some time before he slips into the grave. And he's not a big talker, I'm afraid. Is there anything we can do? Sure, run another check on all of his acquaintances. You know, his friends, his lovers... I need some leverage. Will do. If we can determine the amount of plute he stole, it'll give us an idea of the size of the gadget that we're dealing with. What I can't figure out is who would send the message about the bomb, unless it was one of Leitzig's friends. Perhaps it was an enemy. Does Sabrina Carver have Philpott by...? Her dad's some state department honcho, and a friend of Philpott's. I suffered under party member's children before. Same everywhere, eh?- Ah! Well, at least she's not in command. Get down! Okay, one shot, Sabrina. One shot. Ah, my gas mask! How's our fuel? At this rate, we can make Istanbul, maybe more. Damn it! Gas! Gas! Gas! Gas! Gas! Gas! Yes! Perfect hit! It's all yours! All right, let's go! UNACO 2 and 3, UNACO Leader. Formate on me. Hold back 50 meters. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. Move it, you guys!- Check your loads. UNACO Leader, target in sight. Number three, hold position. Number two, move in! Wilco. UNACO 2, system's ready.- Roger. Fire at will! On target! I got 'em! It's hit! Gas in the car! Gas in the car! Number three engaging. Bull's-eye! Number three, breaking off. They are sleeping like babies! I'm dropping you down. Two and three, hold back. I'm moving in. We're right over it. We're right over the top. Number three, pull up! Oops. Steady, bring me down, bring me down. Bring me down, Kolchinsky. That's it. Okay, to the right, to the right. Keep with it! Okay, I'm on! I'm on! Okay. Number two, move in. Stay close. Hold tight! Wait! Wait. Easy! Two alongside. Moving in closer. Open fire! Shit, they are wide awake! They've got gas masks! What? There's a fucking army in there! Got one, got one! Give me backup, come on! Give me some backup! Can't take 'em out! I'm hit! - I got 'em! - He's hit! He's hit! Aw, shit! Shit! Kolchinsky, are you okay? Talk to me, all right?-Yeah. Hold your fire! What's he doing? Taken hits, rotor vibrating. Back off! Back off! Watch out! Watch this. You bastard! Mike! Mike, talk to me. Pull away! Pull away! Shit! Kolchinsky! Get your ass down here, now! Kolchinsky, come on! Come on! Closer! Shit! Give me the other clip. Come on! Get down here! Oh, God! Come closer! Closer! You son of a bitch, get the fuck off my train! Closer, Kolchinsky! Get it down here! Jump! Jump on it! Eat flames, cocksucker!- Ah! Ah! Come on, Graham, jump! Okay. Stay right there! Stay there! Okay, hang on! Let's get out of here! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck it. Grab on! Grab my hand! You... yeah! Bastard.- It's okay. You're okay. Bad luck, eh? Yeah, lousy. Real lousy, yeah. A funeral pyre of twisted metal is all that remains of the elite German unit. Speculation as to the hostages' safety continues as the train approaches Zurich, having crossed the Swiss border 30 minutes ago. Now we go live to Freight 4402 entering Zurich. The identity or goals of the hijackers remains a mystery. - Hey, look! - Oh my God. What we've just witnessed is an execution by one of the... No, we're waiting for official word, but it appears to have been a cold-blooded retaliation for the German military's earlier attempt to take control of the train. Two as promised. This obviously confirms the hijackers... But no mention of the bomb. At least we keep that secret. I should have known they'd have gas gear. They were too well prepared to ignore... Aren't you ashamed? I told you I'd kill two if you screwed with me again. Killing hostages will make no difference. It's stupid! You're a fool! What happened to mediating, Malcolm? You're not taking sides now, are you? Dispatch, route me to Bolzano, Italy. The junction's in two kilometers. Bolzano. And Malcolm, try to calm down. You couldn't have known. Tell the dead. I thought I knew him. Phil... sir... Angola. You remember Angola? This guy fought in our unit, we fought with this guy. I don't remember his name, but I'd swear he's a merc. Maybe. Have Yolanda narrow her search to the mercenary database. Yes, sir. "Know thy enemy," sir?- Right. If he is a mercenary, he'll never blow himself up for ideals... He's in this for the money. He'll never detonate that bomb. Another assumption. Examine the route between Zurich and Bolzano. Maybe the Alps will give us an opportunity. Yeah, sir. Man, reminds me of blind dates I've had. Mmm, hold it! Probability of a match. Not bad. Tierney, Alex. From the dead hijacker we shot off the train? Yeah. There aren't many R4s... South African. Fine weapon, but most governments don't do business with them. We're checking the serial number with the manufacturer to find out who purchased this little gem. And then, we follow the money. Somebody has to be financing those hijackers. Mr. Philpott. Ahh, and there we are. AlexTierney, mercenary. Out of Miami, works for anyone. Look at that... I could beat that on one cylinder. Michael! There's always Sebring or Watkins Glen. We've gotten the okay from the Swiss and Italian governments. Splendid! Now, as discussed, the train's route takes it through one alpine tunnel... 10 kilometers long... We stop Tierney there. We block both ends with locomotives onceTierney's inside. An Italian railcrew's on its way to rip up track deep in the tunnel. All right. Isn't what we're doing more important than whizzing in a circle? Sigi, we'll need direct radio communication with the Italian railcrew. Michael, please. And if the bomb detonates, then the effect will be minimized by the tunnel. I swear this guyTierney won't set it off. What if the control is in someone else's hands? I mean, it could be. Then... our mission will be over. The bomb will be dealt with. At its present rate, 4402's about an hour from the Swiss head of the tunnel. And there you have it. Mm-hmm. Yeah? Collect insurance, kilometer 842. Got it. 10-4, good buddy. Sir, headquarters just called. Tierney's cellular received a nine-second call... Not enough time to trace its origin. Outside support. Thank you. Sigi, what's the status with the Italian railcrew? Attention, Italian crew... Sir, 4402's slowing. What? Yes, the hijackers are slowing. Hustle! Hustle! Hustle! Come on! Okay, all right. Okay. Where are they? Just an alpine grade. It's yard 842, a supply yard. Damn! Go! Let's go! I got it. Great, where's the Italian military? Maybe they're already inside. No, they're Italian... they're late. To hell with it, let's go. Come on. Philpott, we don't see our Italian backup, we're moving in. Sigi, the blip behind Tierney is our rear blockade? Yes, sir. They won't be leaving the way they came. And why isn't our Italian locomotive moving to blockade the other end? Italian dispatch, what's the status of your locomotive? Italian locomotive, clear to Tirano tunnel, over. Anything approaching? Only my lunch. Alex! It's our mediator. Yes. Tierney, we've torn up track in front of you... stop the train. That's Mr. Tierney, if you please. There's no way out. We'll see about that. Hey, did you get it done? Ho! Ho! Two half-lengths! Bring the spanners! They replaced the rail. What the hell were those Italians doing? Let's go. Flare grenades first. Come on, come on! - Are we repaired?! - Not yet! Rodenko, what the hell are you doing, guy? We got to go! Hit it, we got to go! We got to go! Okay.- Hit it, we're clear. Fuck! Fuck. Shit! - Major! - I'm okay... flak-jacket. Shit, I only speak English. Fuck! Gun's jammed. Nick! Nick! Nick, stay down, we'll get to you! You're covered! Okay, let's go, let's go. Move it! Move it! At least the bomb didn't go off. Let's not let failure go to our heads. Yes, Philpott. Sir, we've got an ID from the South African manufacturer on the hijacker's weapon.- And? It was purchased on a standing Russian military account. Russian? What branch? Spetsnaz. No names on the requisition. See if they'll tell you who's authorized to use that account. Russian. What's it like on the train? Always two men with guns watching the bomb. They never fed us. We'll get you some grub soon. Listen, tell me something... Did anybody tinker with it? Tinker? No, the leader only studied the outside. There's a locked telephone keypad. Detonation code could be entered right there. Maybe it's a phone. Somebody could call it, like a fax machine. So, Tierney wouldn't blow himself up, but someone else would? No, no, he wouldn't let that happen. No, Mike, Tierney doesn't have a clue. He doesn't know. So despite valiant efforts, Freight 4402 continues south with its cargo of hostages. Brian Poole, BBC, Milan. Hijacked train 4402 is proving to be a law enforcement nightmare. Repeated attempts to overpower or outsmart the hijackers have failed, leaving a trail of bodies along the tracks... I got an inventory of materials unaccounted for from the plant. How good a bomb builder are you? You tell me. A sloppy scientist would use that much plutonium to make one bomb. Or he could be a craftsman and make two. The latest reports put the train somewhere in the Alps, near the Italian border. Sigi.- Oh, thanks. There's a great deal of poetry and fine sentiment in a cup of tea. I hope there's also a lot of caffeine. Mr. Philpott, I've got Graham. Yeah, Philpott. You paged, "Bwana"? You alone?- More or less. Your team's chowin' down. Hey, Michael, it's your team, too. The hijackers' weapons search seems to have paid off. But there may be a problem with at least one of the Russians. No kidding... in my team? All right, all right. I think this whole hijacking is being financed out of Moscow. Brings new meaning to the term "Russian roulette," eh? Do you want me to split them up? No. I'll keep a close watch. All right. Good luck. Thanks. Well? It's good. What did Philpott say? We tail the train.-That's all? That and a pat on the butt. Can't you find a way to just trust me? I don't know what you're talking about, sweetheart. The name's Sabrina. What are you holding back, Mike? Not a thing. I tell it like it is, and it's like this... I'm runnin' this field operation. Would you care to sit down? No... sir. Okay. You going to just stand there? Hey, hey, hey, speak English. Porco? What's that, pork? Pig? Dispatch! Dispatch! This is dispatch. Route me to Trieste, all right? Arrange for a doctor with supplies. Mr.Tierney, where do you want him? I'll let you know. Global News Network, Munich. International Affairs Producer. International, Halloran. I want you to know that they have been hiding the facts. Freight 4402 is carrying a nuclear bomb. Who is this? I'll call again. You're not going to believe this. Guys? Cream, no sugar. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Philpott.- Malcolm. Sir.-C.W., hang on. It's GNN... they want to know if there's a bomb on the train. Just cover it up. Yes, C.W., sorry. Leitzig's wavering... I asked him about the possibility of two bombs. I'm playing hardball. It could backfire. Yeah. Hey! Help! Help! Get a doctor! Now! Don't you die, you son of a... Damn! Help's comin', Franz. There is no such number. Please consult your international operator. Oh, man. Benin gave us a bogus number. I can't even call out. He's left us to die. You're not going to die. No! Huh-uh! No! He's too young! Get me an old guy, a real old guy. I want a doctor. Come on. So much for an agent on board. You make me wait five minutes, and I kill this man. What are your demands? Cooperation! Is there a nuclear bomb on the train? Where's the goddamn doctor? Is there a bomb? Would you like to make a statement? Go on. What group do you represent? When will you release the hostages? Is it true you are Red Brigade? Aren't you American? Stop! Stop right there. Open your coat. All right. Do you have a nuc... As the siege of hijacked German train 4402 continues, the question of how to deal with an increasingly desperate situation remains unanswered. The identity of the hijackers is unclear, but reports confirm at least one of the killers is an American. One German hostage has managed to escape... Karl, why the hell did you do this? Benin promised unlimited money if I made him a bomb. It was an excuse, and I used it as an excuse, just to see if I could do it. But then, he demanded another bomb, and that's when I was irradiated by his inferior equipment. Did you finish the second one? Yes. Who is this Benin? General Konstantin Benin. It was he who sent the killer. And where is he now? I don't know, but get him and I will tell you anything.-Yeah. What?! No, English! English! He'll die unless he gets full medical care. Alex, I want... I want off. No. No, no, stay. I need you. No, not if I won't drive. Mr. Tierney?- Patch him up! What?! I've just talked to my people, and we can offer you a deal. Yeah, right.- Now listen... You're about to cross into Slovenia, and you haven't committed any crimes there. So just give up, and they will let you walk. Thank you so much for your concern, Malcolm, but I don't think so. But really, thank you for offering. Mr.Tierney, you stay on that train, you're a dead man. So how'd you get to be such a crackerjack shot? Do you really care? I bet you were army. Biathlon... skiing and shooting... For the US Olympic team. We get a medal?- Bronze. Oooh-eee. You going again? No, I have another career now. Uh-huh, what's that? Sergei, are Russian men as narrow, rude and charmless as our redneck gentleman farmer here? Redneck? What is redneck? Hey, I was only getting some background information on you. If I'd asked him the same questions, would have he got into such a tizzy? I know that Philpott thinks you're great, but I can't imagine why. Well, Sabrina, that's why you ain't boss. Hey, come on, I'm only kidding. Mike, I saved your ass in that boxcar. That you did. But I bet before this gig's over, I repay the compliment. God, you are so arrogant. Hey, remember... Only the young die good. Philpott. Leitzig's confirmed it. He made two bombs, both for a General Konstantin Benin. Good. Good work, Doctor. Thank you. Dispatch, I want Belgrade. Switching to Belgrade. That routes you through Slovenia. Good news, bad news. We're all on headsets, sir. There are two devices... two. We don't know where the second one is. It's probably not on the train. Any change in plans? I think that Tierney is considering our deal. Now keep following the train, but give him room. Philpott out. Sir... Yolanda on the coded phone. Ms. Sanchez. Every Russian officer authorized to use that weapons account checked out... except one. Now let me guess... General Konstantin Benin. Right.- Where's Benin now? Nobody knows, not even the Russians. Thank you, Ms. Sanchez. That's it. Men's room. The death train continues its mysterious path... Mmm, what's on your mind? We were wondering, does Tierney know that the gadget might have a remote detonator? Well, it's worth tossing around. With all the bashing he's been taking, he must be pretty well roasted by now. All right, well, you keep playing the mind games and we'll tail him through Slovenia. Will do.- Uh-huh. Public Affairs. It's Sabrina. Run this number. It's from a payphone in Zagreb. Got it. Find out the last number called... Rodenko was the one who made it. A private call?-Yes. I got to go, okay? Thanks, bye. Freight 4402 remains somewhat of a mystery. Thinking of quitting? No, I'm on course. Rodenko tells me you're negotiating with the police. Fuck you, you commie sack of shit. You're dumpin' out on me. I can't even call you. What's your phone number? That's for security. Now you stay loyal, you understand? What's your goddamn phone number? Hey, drive this thing! Drive it! - What?! - Mr.Tierney... Screw you. I was just wondering, did you know that your bomb could be detonated by remote? Just a phone call. If we knew who was behind this, we could block any incoming call. But I'd like to bet that you can't take that bomb off the hook. Halloran, please. Halloran. The bomb... it is a 3-kilogram plutonium construction. The plutonium was stolen from the Norton nuclear power plant by Dr. Karl Leitzig, who also built the bomb. It is on Freight 4402. I will reveal its destination in due course. Hey, who is this? Are the facts clear? Yeah, I got 'em. Hey, Captain Crunch, take us closer. What are you doing?- Evaluating. We will all die sometime. Oh, Karl, Karl... give me a break. We're trying to save lives here. Very well. The most difficult thing is the nuclear trigger. My hardest task was to make sure that they produce an absolutely symmetrical detonation. General Benin got the triggers. They were 1990s Soviet designs, yeah? And that keypad... Enters the detonation code. And after one minute... poof. It is irreversible. Once the bomb starts, only I can stop it. So how do you disable those triggers? Dr. Whitlock, I must save something... Otherwise you will just leave me to die. A bomb on the train? GNN's Roger Flint reports from Italy. Unconfirmed reports have suddenly escalated the situation on hijacked Freight 4402, now in Slovenia. GNN believes there is a homemade nuclear bomb on board the train. All right, no one's screwing with us. Thank you, thank you, thank you. The actual construction of the bomb seems to have been carried out somewhere in Germany. Well, that changes the game. Sir, they've pinpointed the number of the payphone call Sabrina sent in... Munich. Rodenko called Munich?-Yeah. It's a cellular listed to Blumen aus Deutschland. No exact address. Tell the Munich police. How long are we going to follow this maniac? Until we're ordered otherwise. I don't think Sir Philpott is capable of making a decision. But you are? UNACO chopper, Philpott here. People, how are we holding up? Oh, just peachy. Sir, out in the field it is apparent we need to make a more aggressive stance. Oh, Ms. Carver, that call you made proved to be unfriendly. Got it. Good hunting. Philpott out. Kolchinsky... land us on the roof of the last car... now! They'll kill us, Rodenko! They won't kill me. Do it! - No! No! - Next time I'll kill you! Nail him! Okay. Kolchinsky. Kolchinsky! He's unconscious.- Holy shit! Now what? Can you fly one of these things, too? That one.-What, this one? Oh God, I guess not. Come on, Crunch, come on! Come on, Crunch, wake up! Mike! Pedals, Mike! I'm pedaling, Crunch, I'm pedaling. Crunch, come on, man. Okay, you're okay. Stay with me. Stay with me. Crunch, come on! Come on. You're okay! You're okay. You got it?-You bet. This is to record my intentions, should I fail or should I die. My name is General Konstantin Benin of the former Soviet Union. The hijacking of Freight 4402 was my doing. The building of a nuclear bomb was my plan. It was not my intention to arm Iraq. It was my intention to revive the Soviet Union. When the last coup failed, nerve failed. But when the world hears that a nuclear bomb is in the hands of Iraq fanatics, then the Russian army will be forced to invade to recover the bomb for Russian security. And then, with our army mobilized, our nerve will not fail and there will be a new union... A military union. What are they doing? Don't you know I've got the bomb? We've got the bomb. I know the code. I can blow us all to hell. You want proof? I can blow us all to hell! Alex, they believe you! They damn sure will. Hey, Philpott. Dispatch. This is Philpott. What about my offer? No, listen, this is my demand. I want everybody on Earth to know that I've got this bomb, so here's what you're going to do... You get GNN. I want GNN on this train, and we'll show the world that I'm not bluffing. Okay? GNN? You mean a reporter? Yeah... that curly-haired dude, that cocky guy, whats-his-name? By the awesome destructive power of nuclear weapons. Roger Flint?- Roger Flint, right. I want Roger Flint on the train. I'll pick him up in Belgrade. Roger Flint. No, he never saw me. First I had on the gas mask, and then in the tunnel it was too dark. All right. GNN's Roger Flint has agreed to do it as long as he gets an exclusive. And so, Ms. Carver, you are to be his camerama... person. Philpott out. Ms. Yamamuro, what's the word on Benin's phone line? Munich police have a good lead. We need more than that. You know about video cameras? How hard could it be? Hi. You Pierre?- Ah. Mike Graham. This thing still gonna take pictures? Certainly. You get one shot. It's for me. Just one? Best we can do if you want video. Stealth video... yeah. As I wait for the approaching train, I can say that I have never covered a story like this. Yugoslav army troops stand ready should the hijackers provoke an armed response. Though I've been assured that due to the delicate nature of... Jeez, what did you step in, Crunch? I hear it. Just quit flickin' your foot around, all right? She'll be comin' around the mountain She'll be comin' around the mountain, when she comes... Now release the vacuum advance in number two cylinder. Right, I got it. He's coming in too fast. Here it comes. Freight 4402, approaching us now at Belgrade Station. It appears to be having difficulty stopping. Brake. Brake harder. Yeah, I can drive this thing. The hijackers are motioning us toward the locomotive. I can see Dr. Serafal Menigen held at gunpoint by Alex Tierney. I recognize you.- I'm Roger Flint. Right, Roger Flint, GNN. Who's that? Lois Dobbs, GNN video. Come on. Right, she's on board. Go, go! All aboard underneath.- Splendid. Go on, it's in there. Watch your head. Crunch, you okay?-Yeah. I thought you wanted to show your bomb. Shut up! Keep moving. It's in there. It's right here, Roger. Fine, good. Is that on?- Not yet. Roger? Turn it on. Get this is the shot. You got this in the shot? Yes, sir. And we hope, within moments, to uplink with Roger Flint live aboard Freight 4402. I'm set.- All right, good. Go ahead. You ready to uplink, Lois?-Yes, sir. Okay. Three, two, one. We are now inside Freight 4402, heading southeast. Next to me is AlexTierney, leader of the hijackers. Our Geiger counter confirms... Look at Tierney. Radioactive material within this ominous steel box. I'd speculate that the guarded nature of law enforcement... Whatever! Hello, world, this is "Mondo" Tierney. I have the bomb... and I'm prepared to blow myself up before being taken prisoner. Now, I'm not insane, and I'm not acting alone. This is a covert operation designed to rein... rein... Yes! Rein... Tierney's hit! Get down! Crunch!- One man, up front. Michael? Kolchinsky? Are you there? UNACO, come in! Anyone! Sabrina? Yeah, okay. We're okay.- Good. Come in, Michael. What's happening? We're secure. We've got some wounded down here. Hurry with medical. On its way, Michael. Do svidanya, Cowboys. We've got a situation here... The bomb's counting down. C.W., I need the defusing sequence now. Karl, it's counting down. Technical difficulties. Need that sequence... no bull. Karl, do you understand? It's counting down. In this order only. Black, blue... Malcolm... black, blue... green, yellow... green, yellow...- Black, blue... 25, 24, 23...- ...green, yellow... 22, 21, 20. Orange.- ...orange. Michael, orange. I got that. There's two left. Wait, wait. Orange... white, red. Karl, are you sure?- No. Eight... It's probably white and red. Probably white and red. Six, five... four, three, two, one. The camera working? We are hoping to regain our uplink with Roger Flint and his crew inside the train. Ah, we can see activity outside one of the boxcars. Michael, the glass is only half empty. Oh, really, how's that? Well, Benin's second bomb needs your attention. Now?- I can think of no better time. You and Ms. Carver will be picked up in five minutes. Destination: Munich. Just peachy. Just peachy. Come on, it's not that bad.- Okay? You got two legs. No longer a catastrophic threat, no longer a rolling hell, the death train waits, empty. German railway officials... Yes, thank you. The phone company's completed the tap on Benin's cellular. Excellent. One second from oblivion. For every living thing within miles, it came down to that one critical second. Authorities have just confirmed that the bomb Karl Leitzig constructed would have indeed detonated. German craftsmanship. Karl, what about the second bomb? Estimates on loss of life from the blast... up to five million people.- Karl. And from the fallout and subsequent radiation... another 20 million people.- Karl. Many of those casualties would have suffered burns... blindness, and eventually, cancer. Here we go. On speaker. Iraq. General, if you are watching GNN, you know the second device is reliable. My people in Iraq will take delivery. Meet me at 34 Zendlinge Strasse in one hour. I will have it. Signed, sealed and delivered. Philpott calling UNACO 1. UNACO 1, go ahead. It's Philpott. I'm faxing you a firm location for Benin's exchange. It's a residential district in Munich. How'd you get it, sir? Off Benin's cellular. Munich police are covering. You'll just make it. Sir, he'd never do that. I beg your pardon? Benin knows we have his number. It's got to be a bluff. It's all we have. You just be there. If I bought a bomb, I'd fly it out, fast. Hmm, are you doubting the chief? Raoul?-Yeah? How many airports around Munich can handle private jets? Besides the international? One. Let's go there.- Okay. No way... no, no, no, no way. Get permission. Yeah, well, we're on a snipe hunt. Snipe? What's that? Damned if I know. 10 years in Kentucky and I never saw one. You know, I remember... I think it was Panama... There was this hot-shot lieutenant and he had... Wait! Wait! Shhh, shh! Well? You were lucky.- I was smart. That's a Russian uniform. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay. Raoul, patch me to Philpott. Phil, remember that time in Argentina? You found them! Just like I said. We're going to lay low until we get backup, okay? Give me your exact location. Mike! Michael! Shi-it! You will fly us out of here now! Go, go! Okay, go, go! Cover me! Mike! Close the rear door! Mike! Shit! Hey! Drop the gun! A clip! Where's a clip? Shit. Oh, damn! Sabrina! There you go! Here we go! Come on! All right. I'm out of ammo. Where's Benin?- I nailed him. Yeah? Now we're even on the box car. Yeah, yeah. Oh, shit. No. No way! Black... Oh God. Think it's got the same diffusing sequence? I don't know, I gotta believe so. Black, blue... green... Oh God, Michael. Whoever is hearing this, I give you the rest of your life. Yeah, I knew it all along. You too, huh? Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Michael? Michael, come in, will you? Damn it, what is going on? Ms. Carver... somebody... answer. Michael! What a night. What a day. I wonder who won Daytona.
