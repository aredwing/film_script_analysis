I snore? - Like a tractor. Dad was snoring. Do you remember? Yes, I remember. When will he return from Germany? When the war ends. - Well, when? When you stop asking stupid questions! Did you see? Those Velronians villains. Devil's spawn, Ill tell you. Hey, you there! What do you want? - Hey, Aztec... the boundary of long Verne is Chevillon. I am sure? Well, so what? So those are our rabbits you are poaching. I just wanted to say. - Just look at him. Do you think that you two retards can stop us? Say that again! - You fucking limp dicks! Freaks, limp dicks. Slap cocks! Slap cocks! Come on, quick! We will tell Lebrac! You'll see! Yes, we will tell Lebrac! Oh, no, not Lebrac! I'm scared!.. Fuck off, limp dicks! Slap cocks! Fuck you! - Freaks! Get out! - Snot noses! Slap cocks! Does it hurt? To be honest, yes. 'Slap cock'. A worse insult does not exist. Why? - Don't you know what a 'slap cock' is? Of course, I know. It's sort of a... 'stupid cow?' No, a thousand times worse. This is a declaration of war! A new war of the buttons Who is that with Simon? Miss Simon! Who is that? My goddaughter. Her name is violet. Come on. She is visiting from the city. - From Clermont, I think. Violet from Clermont. This is violet. Hi! Look, another Simon. She is beautiful. - Not like our girls. They are a herd of cows. This girl comes from the city! Hey, wake up. Has she put a spell on you? What is that? Did you fall? - No, the Velronians... I will tell the story. We found them in Chevillon. - What? "Them?" Yes, they were poaching in our territory. - The bastards! And they called us slap cocks. Slap cocks, us? - And you especially. Come on, children line up. What do we do? What do we do? What do we do with those Velronians? - I need... I need to think about it. Marshai, we are ready. You gave us hope. The nation will rise Marshali, Marshali we are ready... take a seat. Sir? - Yes, Bacaille? Why do we sing only on Mondays? Excesses are harmful to everyone. With all due respect, but singers you are not. He thinks he's Tino Rossi. What did you say Lebrac? - Nothing important. I thought as much. But since you like to chat so much, Stand up please, go to the board. - No-No! Are you sure? I'm still sane. Come on. That's a laugh! Monsieur Lebrac... tell us about the Loire. I'm listening. Well, it's an animal... with ears. Not the dormouse. The river. The river. Well... well... it is a stream. ...with water. Otherwise it would not be a river. But it is, of course... is a river. It is not very far away. And, not too big. And, no, of course very far away. It is not so small. There are many cities along it. Well, okay. Cities on the seine... on the river, as you say... they are very different. Some are big. You can visit them. Others - Are medium-Sized... and still others are small as ours. There, in those cities fishermen live, who go fishing. They catch eels, mullet, gobies... well, sometimes shoes. Particularly convincing. Do you know the way? - Oh, yes, sir. The teacher was nice? Well, she could be worse. Does she ask a lot of questions? - Yes. About the verbs in the present and future tense. Good day, dear Simon. Mr. Mayor, how are you? - As it should be. What a lovely creature. Good day, young lady. A relative? My goddaughter. - And what's her name? Violet. Her parents sent her here, because she has weak lungs. A better place than here for bad lungs cannot be found. And where do we come from? She lived in Rennes. Has she swallowed her tongue? Violet is very shy. Well, we certainly will not eat her. Give me the town's paper. That is mandatory. What else? - I forgot the most important. My wife needs ten feet of black braid. You might think she is going to be a widow! Do you like this one? - You would imagine to see its like in Paris. Here from London. Appeals to the French people. Listen to the instructions... - Say it a little louder for the Germans. Yeah, Hitler was at the door eavesdropping. To your room, Im sick! And do not laugh. - But you're funny. Be careful, that I can't control what you think. My eyes have never seen such a coward! Now you asked for it! Well, wait, and see, now I get it! Stop it, Camille. You yourself were once like that. - But I respected his father! If we do it, after what they said, we are in fact limp dicks. This collaborationist deserves a lesson! Hey.. Wait for me! Why is he here? - We are not a kindergarten. Stay at home, I said! But they insulted me too! - This is not a game. We're going to war. - So I have my slingshot. Okay. But when trouble comes it's every man for himself. You're only saying this because Im small. If I grew up... if I was big... - Well, what then? It would be great. And who made your boss? You weren't elected. I am the most intelligent and not afraid of anything. Let's measure dicks. The one with the biggest is boss. Pants down. In that case, I have not yet reached the stage to be a commander. We will feed them gruel. - What did I do? Quiet, I said! It's not on purpose. I'm going. - Walk softly. Quiet! Velron Long Verne Don't blunder. - Who do you think I am? Hurry up. - I do what I can. Truck! Hide! Faster! All Velron-Ites have hairy asses Krauts. That was close. I do not believe my eyes! You're back! It's been so long! We must celebrate! Plum gin. This. I make it myself. Do you remember? It kept me going in Saigon. Protected against all diseases and flies. To the colonial regiment! Bottoms up, if you are not a wimp! Go! We were supposed to stay. We were not allowed to come back. What do you think? You're right, you should not think. You should drink. Come, I must show you something. Little Gibus! - Hey, little Gibus! Where is he? - I knew this would be a problem. But what could I do? He followed me. I'm really glad, dwarf. These are my souvenirs. Twelve years in the legion. Sidi, bel abbes, Casablanca. And then on the ship and... Saigon, Bien Hoa, Cao bang... I was 'admiral. ' Even this yellow-Skinned shorty respected... And the women... one look at the uniform and they Laid right on their backs and spread their legs. I was somebody. I fought for France. Eight injuries But Im still alive! - Sorry. To the colonial regiment, by golly! - The colonial regiment, by golly! Aren't you ashamed to see him drink? Never too early to start. - Enough already. Give me your glass. What are you doing here, slap cock? - What kind of disrespect to the guest is this! I immediately recognized him. The spirit of the dwarf. He was killed at Bien Hoa. He is a long Vern-Ian. No. He died in my arms. I told him that we will be together. And here he is! Here he is! You have not changed, dwarf. Still the same size. And always up for a party. Do you remember? Hey, we'll chop on their sausages, we will chop them on? For all the guys from the north and south. Damn Belgians who shoot themselves in their own legs. Damn Belgians who shoot their own legs. Have you seen him? - No, have you? Me neither. Goodbye, mister Aztec. You are always welcome, dwarf. We are friends through thick and thin. Thank you, captain... captain! At ease! Quick march! Hey, we'll make them share their sausage, share their sausage Oh, dwarf... that's really your brother. Super-secret operation! Yes, he's drunk. Shh! Enough is enough! Stop it! There she is, there she is! Where are the heads as here are the assholes! You guys are hilarious. So you've never touched it. And you wouldn't know what to do with it if you had. I know what I need to do to draw a girl's attention. This works with her. - Oh, really? Well, look. Nothing's happening. Hey... you're new? - And you're Lebrac? A... yes. And, yes... are you not sure? - I'm sure. What do they say? - I do not know. Stop following me. - I? Follow you? Yes, you. - You're not my type. Am I not beautiful? You're not bad. But you're not blonde. I heard about you. - You bet! Everyone knows me. I know you're the class clown. And a poor student. I just fall for intellectual smart guys, mister Lebrac. Lebrac! - Oh, it's the same thing. Why are you sulking? - I don't sulk. You are also like a fishing rod. - Oh, it's because of the zero on your spelling. Since when is this sulking! I do not sulk, I think. About what do you think? - On a strategy. How do you know this strategy? From his father. He served in the colonies. Yes we know. Charge! Slap cocks! Who are the mightiest of all? The men from Velron! You bastards! - Slap cocks! You attacked us! - Yes, thieves! Slap cocks! - Shit heads! So what is your strategy, anyway? Listen up, guys. 'After this blatant... naked... insolent... attack... we have no other choice but to play by their rules. The war will be ruthless. Blood and tears will flow , we will suffer losses But such is the price of victory, And ps... and therefore... here I hate your speech! In short war is declared. We kick ass like ass has never been kicked that they will remember forever! All this sounds real good, but you have no plan, do you? So what? I listened very carefully in class about napoleon, king of France. You mean emperor. - It does not matter. He was a brilliant strategist. As he defeated the Prussians at waterloo... uh huh, right - But what do we do? I will explain my plan. In a calm, secure place. What do you want, little Gibus? It's war, sir! - Really? You have it from me. Until tomorrow, sir. Wait for me guys! No! You have to scare me. You have to look menacing. And yell at the same time. Next. - They think that we don't have the guts. We'll take them by surprise. This is called psychological warfare. Charge! These cretins attacked us! Come on, follow me! You wouldn't hurt a defenseless man! You're lying! - You're not a man. Can I kill him? Yeah, run away! - Fuck off! Get out! Now who's a slap cock? Death to all Velronians! Let me go! - What a dragonfly! Bring him here. Help! What are you doing? Psychological warfare. - It's okay. First, we'll pull out your fingernails. - Yes! Then poke out your eyes. Then we'll cut out your tongue. And then we'll cut off your dick! If we can find it. And then your balls. And who's a slap cock then!? I'll tell my father! - He can rot in hell! And the pope too! I'll tell the Aztecs... will send a portion of rotting guts Of rotting intestines to them to ransom you! Go to hell! - And to the priest will tell! The intestine had stretched thin! Down with the priests! All will say that Aztec the Velronians swine was sent running with his pants down. Backwards! Out! And if you want another beating come back again on Thursday. We won the war? No, just the battle. Our war must have a name to go down in his toy. I know! The war of the buttons! Sometimes he says clever things. I'm proud of you, shorty. The war will end when all Velronians are sent running bare-Assed. Long live long Verne! Follow me! Miracle in long Verne. I do not know what happened but you seem to be in a state of grace, Everything worked out right. This is for you, little Gibus. - Thank you. Well, all except mister... Lebrac! As a reward we will visit the museum of the prefecture. The bus departs tomorrow morning at 6:.00 am. Sir? Will I be staying here? Am I still being punished? No, you are going. You will have time to learn the history of antiquity, as well as our beautiful rivers. Pay attention to the beauty of the lines. Admire their purity. Here we see not only the talent of the artist But also the superiority of the Aryan race in all its grandeur! The Aryan race, which, of course, is the greatest of all. A controversial point of view. Strange idea, do you think so? I teach children to respect differences between people And treat everyone equally. So I was raised. Here's a result of such an education. Your father... - He was killed at Verdun. And that's good thing. He would not have tolerated your stupidity. Well, I recommend that you all practice sports. Marvel at this the handsome athlete. Just a preternatural animal! - This picture, dear children, Is an ideal worth imitating, some would say. But, sir? - Yes? Did they fight naked? Of course, young man. To show their fearlessness they fought almost entirely naked, With only a sword and shield. Their young bodies, hardened by the struggle Their torsos, shining like onyx, and hips and thighs carved out of alabaster And chest muscles, shining like jade, shone out a challenge... now follow me to the hall of the archdiocese. Forward. Marvel at this handsome athlete! The beauty of his muscles! The supremacy and purity of the body of the Aryan race! I am a Greek warrior! This Greek warrior! Have you seen my muscles? They are very tiny. Do you want an egg? - Yes. Here you go. Violet... here, you don't have much. At home we have enough. - Thank you, that's sweet. You're a lucky guy. Here, sir. And what did you do? - Nothing, nothing, I know him. Brochard... the fool booked a long ride, huh? I had to clean the school. Now I clean my county. Down! Here! Hold her! - Sarah! Sarah! Do not cry. - Shut up! In the car! - Sarah! Sarah! Why do you treat them so? What did they do wrong? What did they do? Ask yourself, why are we arresting Jews? You should be ashamed. You are right. Family - Is very important. Come on, baby. Mom's waiting for you. Do not cry! Do you think that we let this family determine our actions? And, and you there? How is your father? Tell him Ill pass by tonight. Go and play, children. Good evening! It seems that we are inseparable. Two glasses of the same red wine. It brings no good. This continuous cheating. And he? - The teacher? Insignificant. And Simon? Simone is a beautiful plant. I would like to water, Prune her and cultivate her so she maintains her best. In Paris, she had all the men wound around her little finger. And willingly. It's true. How do you know all this? Were you there? Do not start, Mr. Teacher. These women are not for us. They are looking for wealthy men. Gentlemen! Calm down, calm down! You know this is a sensitive matter! - Don't we live in a free county? No, no! You have lost your head. You are not seeing clearly. Brochard was asking about you. What questions? - Have you... Left bank. Prior to the war. Of course, I said 'no. ' I would keep quiet if I were you. He has provided for you Thanks for the advice. A lost battle does not mean that the war is over. You already said that. - Yes? We will win, when they no longer have a single button. This is our only goal. Buttons, buttons and more buttons. Forward for the glory of Zeus! Death to Velronians! Run! Death! Death to Velronians! Yes! This is now called a Greek victory. The museum can be instructive. Let's go home! Death! Death to Velronians! I'll smear you in a frying pan! Death to Velronians! Wait for me! Cold in may? It's Greek. What are the Greeks? - We fought like Greeks. If you know what I mean. You're still angry about that time, Lebrac? Don't worry, Im tough. What are you reading? The Punic wars? Is that a war full of garbage and debris? No, it was a war between Rome and cartage in antiquity. Similar to the Greeks? I'll lend it to you if you want. Just don't lose it, it is my mother's and I cherish it because of her. And where are your parents? They stayed in Brittany. I'm going. Happy reading. Punic wars. Check it out! Are you interested in the Punic wars? Currently, I am most interested in the strategy. Ii I can steal something from the Punics... Ill show you Punics... go inside. You read all the time. You still have meningitis. Go get eggs. Landing subdivisions of allies strike blows against the Germans everywhere, Especially behind the German lines... you heard what my mother said? These marines are heroes. Not like some others. Have some respect. - Each to his own profession. I grow potatoes. With people like you, "fritz" will still be in power for another hundred years. Well, of course. - When Im old enough, Ill be a paratrooper. I can't stand the krauts. He can't stand them. Mr. Muscles. Here Don't slam the door. Who's there? - It's me, Paul. Sorry Im so late. Daddy gave me eggs and pate. Too much for me alone. We just ate. But come on. It can't always be easy for... for what? - For groceries. You do not have a vegetable garden. We do not starve. Sometimes customers pay with a rabbit or a chicken. I save my best. Of course! I did not mean to offend you. I still can bite, as you noticed. It is logical. These are hard times. Not for everyone. What do you mean? - It is going on four years. What's so surprising? All adapt. You, too. Say what you mean if you think me a coward. And if you know people from the 'resistance' - Ask them too. There are many ways to resist. Okay, thank you. It's getting late. And I still need to prepare for my lessons. It is but wasted effort. It has always been so between us. - No, not always. Good night? Yes, good night. This is not the case. In Sparta only the fittest survived. I'd like to see him. What's so funny, Lebrac? I would also like to laugh. Bacaille would not last 5 minutes in Sparta. Quiet! I'm sick of your stupid jokes. You act like a clown. Three hours of detention on Thursday. Serves you right! - And you too, Bacaille! Just because your father is the mayor, does not mean You are exempt from punishment. Get in! With all due respect, sir, Don't you find, that the punishment is a bit too cruel? In the first place, the criminal does not have a right to speak. And secondly, you stay after the others. How are we going to fight the Velronians? Arithmetic. Page 54. I'll wave the white flag? And if they do not accept a truce? We are only three. We will not fight. Do not talk to my brother, stupid. I just wanted to say, stupid. - Shut up, little man. I have grown two inches this month. Look it's long Vernes Guess what?.. We've been looking for you. You found us, slap cocks. - We have a note from Lebrac. 'Since there are only three of us, we do not fight today, But next Thursday instead '. Do you agree? No. What did you write about the Garonne? Shut up. Faster! Camus! Like I said, no fighting. They probably don't know about the white flag. I managed to slip away. But the brothers grabbed Gibus. - If Im not there... Lebrac, stop! Go home naked. Now you don't talk so much, eh? - Lebrac makes you wonder. Oh, Lebrac show us. That's it. One... two... three! Or, we will cut more than the knots? Scared, yes? You squeeze him, huh? Get it! Get him! Nice to see you. I've been expecting you. Are you crying, little brother? - No. Did I cry? - No. Then do as we do. Men do not cry. See you later. - Yeah. Go on, Ill catch up. What happened? - It the Velronians. I wanted to rescue Gibus. But it was a trap. There were a hundred people, and I was caught. Did you catch hell when you got home? I got the belt. I'm used to it. The belt? Come on, I have an idea. - Do not keep it in your head. Let's go! - No, really. Let's go! - No. I took it from the stock of Simon. They are all different. So be ready. It looks weird. It will be the latest fashion. Like in Paris. ...and now the pants. No! - Come on. I can't watch. Here Did you cry? - Me? Bah! It's not my style I saw my father cry once. But I still love him. Would you love me, if I cried? I have no idea. Cry, then we'll find out. Hurry up! Are you okay? - Yes. What are you doing? I was counting the buttons. - You were counting the buttons? For what reason? It was for me. She sewed my buttons again. Like in Paris. Like in Paris? What does that have to do with anything? It would take too long to explain. My parents are waiting. Thanks for everything. Violet, what were you doing with that boy? - Nothing. You let him enter here, sewed his buttons... his father beats him. Unbelievable... is that all? No, not all. We will be married in august. Good evening. Do you know how much time it's been already? You know what? I do not have a watch. - Is the bell for the deaf? What is it? Answer the question. - Cool, huh? It's fashionable in Paris. In Paris, it's fashionable! He was laughing at us. He used to think Im an idiot! - And he still does. Go to bed. Without dinner. - Great! I'm not hungry anyway. Not hungry... there must be a girl involved. A girl? Him? Even the chickens run away from him. Good morning! Good morning! Let me help. They swelled from moisture. That's it. Thank you. Goodbye. Wait a minute! Sorry for last evening. I could not speak. It does not matter. I've already forgotten everything. You will still be stylish. This is very old. From my time in Paris. You wore it when I came to see you. You never came to see me. - I did so. You worked on Cambon street, 5. I did not dare to enter such a luxurious shop! When you came out, there was a young man. He took you by the hand. I never wrote back. I figured you would understand, I guess. I wanted something different. Another life. Sometimes I am moved by complicated forces around me. I cannot live in the past. The point in the end? The point is another subject. Why can't I participate? - You're too small. This is a diversionary raid. Into enemy territory. Some people might not make it back. You're just trying to scare me. But due to the fact That Im so small they might not even notice me. Well... Camus because he is 2nd strongest after me. Le crique because he is smartest. And the brothers Gibus because they are the brothers Gibus. And you, Bacaille? - Your stuff is pointless. Are you saying that Im a coward. Not a coward, just cautious. - No problem. You simply pay a special tax. Tax? - Tax for cowards. Lebrac and I have been thinking. We want a fair and egalitarian society. What does 'egalitarian' mean? The rich stay home and pay the poor peanuts to go and fight on the front. A true democracy. Rate: two slices of ham and four sausages. If my father caught me, he would beat me, and I would run badly. Let it solve itself. That's the law of the republic. - I just wanted to say. Go! This republic of yours sucks! Long live the king! Look, someone's moving. Saturday was laundry day in Velron. We'll show them who the slap cocks are. Give me the binoculars, I want to see. And the adults, too? No mercy. Everything off. Buttons, buttons! One more time! Buttons, buttons! One more time... let's go! Now! Not bad. Not bad? - Yes, these are our spoils of war. Where should we hide them? - Somewhere in our territory. And let's build a fort? - Immediately. And a big one. Everyone. If you do it yourself it will take forever. - If we work together, we will finish it in no time. We will do it, Camus. - It was my idea! Of course! I'm proud of you. Thank you, general! Hey, everyone, I have to go. I have something I have to do. What are you doing? Can I come up? - Do you know how to fly? Almost. You're crazy! It's like Errol Flynn in 'robin hood. ' Have you seen that movie? I've never been to the movies. This Errol Flynn - Is he cute? Yeah, I guess. - Yeah he is -Just like me. Wow what a pretense! I'll grab a towel. What were you doing? Writing in my diary. - Can I read it? A diary is secret! You girls are strange. A diary is secret. - Yes. So you write about me? - Why would I? I don't know... just like that. Yes, it's Murielle Balin. I like her. She has class. Before the war, every week I Went with my parents to the 'Gourmont-Palace' in Paris. Aren't you from Rennes? I've never been to Brittany. - Then why did you say that? Don't you understand yet? I'd have to wear a star. - A star? Are you a Jew? Females are referred to as Jewesses. And you're a fool. I did not know those things. Do you have any objections? - I do not know. I've never seen Jewish women. Well, only one time in the village. Violet! It's time for dinner! - I'm coming. You have to go. It's a secret. If you betray me, we can never see each other again. I won't say anything. They could torture me and I still wouldn't squeal! It's funny, my aunt is named violet. It's not my real name. My name is Miriam. Are you coming? - In a minute. Five seconds! Miriam... violet... can I tell my gang, that we're going together? Actually, Im already engaged. Careful now! Pliers! The fort is still forbidden to girls? - Not all. You fell in love with the blonde? - Until I met the brunette. You come here every Thursday? - Every time our parents drink. So, every day. Do you have a tape measure? A plumb line? No. This is bad. How can you build a straight fort? How do you think? My father- He's an architect. He designs houses. We know who your father is. Are you in back? My uncle was a mason. I'll take his tools. I will teach you how to handle them. - With a girl bossing us? Shall I tell you to bend over and clasp behind Your knees while I shove a tool up your ass? We're going to get wood. Do not lie. Bacaille began with my parents, because of what you said. You're crazy! I didn't say anything! - Do not worry. You're safe. There are no krauts. - Don't be afraid. I just wish this war ended and I could see my parents again. And I would pay money to get rid of mine. How can you say that? Wait a minute! In any case... I would go crazy here. You should understand me. I'm a city girl. You like to climb trees and sit on top of roofs. - Yes, like a monkey! What are you doing? - Climbing a tree. The only thing I know how to do according to you. You're really stupid! - You and your whole gang of braggarts. I get all the girls I want. Blondes! - Sure. Why not? Take the path of least resistance! I tell you right now:. I hit you right there on your head! Stop it! Stop it! Or Ill leave! - You asked for it! In September, you will go and apprentice in leather-Working! Eventually, you will be able to provide for yourself. I love money! What do you think? But I will be free! Free! You know you do not know what freedom is! Well, what? Well, on the bright side, - More than three pounds. not bad. Radio, leaflets. Everything we asked for. Quite a bit different from our old hunting rifles. Exactly what is needed for a thorough job. If you can understand everything. Hold on. I'll give you a crash-Course. Ah, we should have had that with us at bois-Villiers for that kraut patrol. Shut up about it. The dead do not return. That's Pythagoras. Leave us alone, georgette. I put your lunch in your backpack. What are you looking at? I'm sorry for what happened yesterday. When Im an apprentice, Ill send you all the money. If need be. I'm going. I will never understand that boy. It is always either black or white with him. Is he really mine? Quiet, please. I wanted to ask. Who was Pythagoras? Who told you about him? No one. I'm just asking. Do not waste time. It's not in the curriculum. We now own... Here, I have it. It's not damaged. Did you at least read it? - Of course. On Thursday we move into the fort, and... - And? I was wondering if you wanted to come. Is it comfortable enough for me? I want to show you something. This is my favorite place around here. When things are shitty, I come here. I can see why. It is beautiful here. Strange, isn't it? What is? , if it wasn't for this war we'd never have met. I would have stayed in berlin. - In berlin? Wait a minute... you're confusing something. Paris, this is the third city Ive been to. My parents left because of the Nazis. Your father is really an architect? Yes. And my mother- A teacher of history. I gave you her book. 'Punic wars'? She wrote that? Damn! I really should read it. I just looked at the pictures. But it was useful. I used it to prepare a new attack. Top secret. - You're always at war. I do not know what's going to happen. But I didn't want to disappear, without showing you this. Do you sometimes just like to hang out with girls? And? We're back together again? I have to go. Simone is waiting. You forgot your vegetables. - Oh, yes. My vegetables. Cabbage, tomatoes and potatoes... we'll get by with them until the end of the war. They'll hang! We'll make them! Attack! - Bastards! Bastards! - Attack! Death to the Velronians! Death to the Velronians! Death! Death! The bastards! Shit! We'll cut your guts out! , Aztec, we can avoid bloodshed if you surrender. If you've got the balls, I say we have a duel. Like men. Just you and me. Just the two of us? - Only us two. All right. Get away. Come on, Lebrac! Get him, Aztec! Come on, Lebrac! Be tough! Watch out! Go, Aztec! Next, Lebrac! - No regrets! Come on! Tear him to pieces! - Snap his neck! Come on, Lebrac! Go! I think you've learned your lesson. Never trespass on our land again! Let's go. Run! These are our spoils of war. Three cans of pears in syrup, two cans of cherry brandy, Five cans of apple sauce, two packets of vitamin biscuits, Three sticks of sausage, ham, Two slices of goat cheese... - I'm done counting:. We have 319 buttons. I will continue. Five pairs of laces, three pairs of suspenders and... Bacaille! What's up with you, coming with empty hands? You're the only one. I couldn't take it. My father loves the Cellar for which he had the key in his pocket. Cheapskate! - I am not a miser. If my dad caught me, he would kill me. I also get beaten, if my dad catches me. Well, so what? You're a cheapskate and did not fight. It's true. - It is. Coward. Yes! Coward! - Shit-For-Brains! Coward! Your war is so stupid! Then what are you doing here? Yeah, fuck it! - Fuck off! We will be announcing his banishment. I just wanted to say! I haven't done anything! - That's just it. The republic long Vernes has decided. To us you are no more. Get out of here! Fuck off! Get out! - Go! I have had to do this before. - Exactly. I agree. It's about the girl. We have received an official circular. We must declare all refugee children. Place of birth, parent's address... in short, the usual formalities. And you just happened to come straight to me. She is not your goddaughter. No. But I know her mother very well. She was one of my best customers in Paris. She asked me to hide her daughter. That's why I came back. Now we have to protect her. To do this, I need help. I mean... your help. All right. If I am questioned, I will lie. I will say that we do not have refugee children. I will come up with something. You can count on me. I never doubted you, Paul. The son of the mayor! You will pay us for the others, little pig. Stop it! I didnt do anything! What a rag mop! I'll slit your throat like a pig. Let me go! - 'Let me go!' Why should I? A hostage might be useful to us. What do you want? I'll tell you. We received a letter from dad. You can read it. Here, many more fathers are in the prison camps. - It's true. Whose fathers are in Germany? Read. - Can I? Here - Thank you. 'Dear children... ' that's us. 'I hope you received my letter. Here in the camp, I am well, but today I felt a bit sad... ' That's right here? - Yes. But why should I participate? Maybe you're a double agent. Quiet! Take your position. 'Watch over the garden as you should. Do not forget to rake... ' - Loose. '... And hoe the weeds and trim... ' The thickets. - '... and use the other tools. I often think about you When I look at the picture, that uncle Rena took When we were in Michelin. You have now probably grown large, but do not eat too much soup, Because then I might not recognize you, when I get back. Say hello to all our relatives And, of course, give a big kiss to your mama for me. I really miss you sons. My letter is finished. The rain has stopped, And the sun is peeking out from behind the clouds. You are my sunbeams. Your dad. ' Let's drink to papa Gibus. Fire! - And for all the prisoners! Hooray! Hooray! Fire! Fire! My treasure! The letter from papa! Stay here! - Dad's letter! Lebrac! Lebrac! There will never be peace between us! Never! Thank you, you're no longer needed. - They will kill me! It does not matter. Asshole! - Piece of shit! Bacaille! After him! Faster! Let me go! Let me go! They tortured me! I couldn't help it! It's not my fault. You're worse than a coward. You're a traitor! What are you going to do? - Everyone should punish him. The belt! - No! Yes! The letter from dad's burned! The belt! No! Quiet! - Yes! The belt! Get him ready. - Do not! Please! Are you crazy? Lebrac, you're acting like a Nazi. Give me the belt. - Please!.. Now you. Here! Here's dad's letter! Filthy traitor! - Please! Dad! Dad, help me! Dirty traitor What happened? Who did that? The others... led by Lebrac. No need to cry. Poor thing! Cut faster. - Do not worry. You will pay me my due for these rascals. I demand exemplary punishment. Especially for your son. Do not worry, mister mayor. Who knows what you have waiting. - The villain! I can send you to the police. Then your life is not worth a cent. You do not talk to your son? Rest assured, he'll get what's coming to him. Another thrashing. - There he is! Let's go to mama. - Here, you! Here, I said! - No! I'm leaving! You'll never see me again! I taught him to hunt, so that he wouldn't starve. And so he has to learn to survive. Just what he wanted. What if something were to happen? Imagine that... what? - But you never know what can happen to a child? You should not think the worst. - Be kinder to him. Listen to your conscience. Do you hear it speaking to you? Bacaille now will have to live with this your whole life. Did not I ask you to respect each other, to help each other? And you act as executioners. Yes? - He betrayed us. Sit down. Even the traitor is entitled to a trial. They have a right to defend themselves. But you tortured him. Today, there will be no lessons, I give you a chance to make amends. Who was it? You also have eyes and ears. There are many who were. My father is afraid of the consequences. Lo and behold! Look,... yes? Good morning, Mr. Mayor. Obviously visiting day. ?- Come on. I do not want to see them! Especially not him! - You have little control over your charges, Mr. Teacher. Do you know what they did? They came to apologize. - Not on their own, of course. I do not need to apologize! They are the sons of communists! Have I taught you to lie! - You said so yourself. This is interesting. - Yes, we all know that Lebrac's father is a commie. And violet, I believe, is Jewish. Ask her about her parents, she immediately begins to whine. What does this prove? - That out of the mouth of babes comes the truth. The truth is that he wants attention. - In any case we will examine this more closely. Who has seen her documents? Who has? I am secretary of the city hall. Her papers are in order. Perfectly falsified, you mean. We're going to examine them closely, too. Come with me. Let us see if they are in order, as you say. - Do not talk with your mouth full, Brochard. Come on, guys. I'm going outside. Yes! Let them piss off! Guys... Warn everyone. Lebrac, go to Simon. Quick! All right. Listen, young man, I would know, if something was irregular. If all is as you say, you have nothing to worry about. I'm not worried. I can smell your fear. I have an experience In such cases, with dozens of people like you. Le crique! Warn our friends in the village. I'll take care of violet. Nothing new under the sun. At one time we gave them A good dressing down. - Papa Lebrac remembers it well. He teased me so I hit him in the face. His teeth are still etched in my fist. You should not annoy me. Like the yellow dwarf in Cao bang... the police are on their way to Simone's! They want to arrest violet. I know that you know. Where is he? I'm looking for him. What do you want with him? That is my business. - If you know something you have to tell me. Check it out. I've been looking for you for several hours! The police are coming here! We must hide violet! Is there a backdoor? Quickly, I will delay them. You won't say anything? - Who do you think I am? You may need help? Against the police? I'm not doing this for you, Im doing it for her sake. Come on. Let's go. Hurry! I heard that a girl is staying here. My goddaughter, yes. What's the problem? - Nothing. I want to talk to her. And look at her documents. I do not know where she is. - I do. In the barn, with her friends. Chazal, go check it out. I will stay here. Beautiful Simon. And still single? Such an unforgivable sin. You need a man. A real man. - That's enough. Ills she not with them? Is one of you called violet? I am violet. I am violet. We are all violets. - Well, yes, of course. And you all live in a milliner? - Yes. You may have sheltered a purebred Jew. Bacaille is clearly delirious. I prefer to believe him. Hi, Simon. My wife's birthday. ? I want to buy her a gift. What would she want? - A bathrobe. I will look in their holdings. - Stay here, you! Hello, Simon, I have an order from my wife to pick up. So do I. - From my mother. Don't get in front of me. - You're not from long Verne! So what? - Out of my way! Everyone back! Tell me, Brochard, didn't your uncle serve in a colonial regiment? I had an aide named Brochard. Such an asshole! And lazy. Where is she? Well, she's certainly not here. - You're too stupid. Get out! You'll be sorry. Especially you, Mr. Teacher. Hey, what's he doing here? He helps us. Today only. Let's go. She is not in the barn. I was sure. - There will be consequences. Brochard, you were born here, right? Where are you going, when the krauts are gone? To berlin? Do you want to end up against the wall? With your hands tied? Why not? I took the bullets. So you that you would not be hurt. We'll be back with the SS! Then you'll squeal! I'm the leader! I'm in charge! They need to go. We did everything we could today. I just wanted to say! - We have not told anything. It was fun - But this is not the end of it. The whole village would suffer because of me. The allies will soon be here. Then the Germans and their collaborators will have other concerns. You are a sneak... Pythagoras. And all this time? - Right from the beginning. Then you're coming back? I have a good reason to, don't I? Your shop? You can get married after the war, the wait will be short. My son will take you to little jean, his godfather. Here's a note for him. He will give you safe haven. These are the supplies. - Thank you. Can I help? - Yes, please. We are almost there. The road leads into the valley. There it is. Quickly now. It's that house. He will help you further. Take care of yourself, soldier. Keep it. This will bind us. Bring it back after the war. I also want to give you something. - That's not necessary, silly. It is. Wait a minute. Damn! I'll wait for you, to sew it. In the Parisian fashion. Now go. Miriam! Violet did not see her parents ever again. A few months later France was liberated And she. Along with Simon, returned to long Verne...
