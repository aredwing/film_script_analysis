Going somewhere, my beauty? China? Tony? Sarah? Where are you guys? Marquis de Sade said that sex without fear and pain is like food without taste. We've been doing our homework. I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that. Guilt. Society. Good and evil. I really don't know. I'm gonna go look for the other two. Okay? Okay? Where the hell are they? Somewhere around? They're not anywhere. I looked everywhere. I checked. I want out of here Sarah. I'm serious. Getting scared? Don't worry. They've probably just gone home. What? Tony and China? Together? Oh. Jealousy wearing its ugly head. I'm not kidding. I want to get out of here now. Okay? I've hoped you have enjoyed your visit. Ah. Yes. Thank you, it was quite enjoyable. Your two friends left earlier. Uh huh. They seemed, loving by much. Tony and China? Well! Goodnight! What is it with this girl? One day it's me, the next day it's Charles Atlas., and now Tony. What does she want? Then why do you still like her? Like her. I don't know if I ever liked her. It's just you want what you can't get I know what you mean. - Hello? Hello, Mrs. Webster? Uh huh. Is China there? No. Johnathan. No? She went to a waxwork party. A party at theh waxwork, huh? Can I give her a message? You don't happen to have the address, do ya? Guys. China. where are you? Ah shit. My god. Good evening. I own this waxworks. Look. I'm sorry. You know I. I, I didn't meant to... I was just following a friend here for some laughs, you know. I'll be leaving. Well that's alright. What's the point of having all these beautiful works of art if you can't appreciate them? This for instance. In't the figure wonderful? Is it the actual mask? As worn by the phantom. In the movie the "Curse of the Opera". They made a movie about the Phantom of the Opera? Would you like a close look? Really? Step in please. They'll make a movie about anything nowadays. I would invite you in, but it's late That's okay. No Mark. Why not? I don't know. I really like you and think you're very attractive. Come on. No. I am serious. It's... it's just. I don't know. I... I'm looking for something else. Hey. It's okay. It's alright. Now go get some sleep. Come on. Scram. Get out of here. Thank You. (Jabbering in Spanish) Shhhh. Be very Quiet. Are you finished? Yes. But you know, my English is not so good. No, no. It's okay. Great. Footnotes and everything. You are an angel. The trouble with dictators. I think the dictators are the bad people they have the shouting voices and the small mustaches? Okay. I'm sorry. I... I'm just a little upset. Okay? Could you tell her that Mark called, please? Okay, thank you. Hi Steve. Here, it's Mark. Is Tony there? He's not. Could you tell him that I called please? Thank You. ...and I spoke to Steve, and he didn't know where Tony was. So then I went by the waxwork this morning. No one was there. I mean, maybe they've been kidnapped guys. Really. Or even worse. Boiling wax. Mark. Maybe she had another party to go to. More like a motel to go to. You know China. No, no James. It's not like that. Tony and China. They're just friends. That's not what you said last night. Okay, so maybe I was a little over emotional. A little? Sarah. I really don't care who China is screwing anymore. I really don't. But I am positive that it's not Tony. So where are they? I still vote for the motel. I'm going to give them till this afternoon, and if we don't find them. I am going to the police. I swear. You know how many people have gone missing in this area in the last two weeks? No. That's a hell of a lot of people in two weeks. And now another two. and you're telling me they've been kidnapped, and boiled in wax. All I know, is that there is something going on in that waxworks. Come on kid. You can give me a better story than that. I told you everything that I know. Yes! Okay, but if this some kind of sick joke I'll have your balls in the slammer so fast, you won't have time to squeal. Do you understand me? Good. Watch this. This weird little tiny guy who is addicted to helium is going to open the door. Weird and tiny, huh? - Hi. - Hi. I'm inspector Roberts. I'd appreciate a look around your waxwork, if that would be convenient. Yes, of course. Why? This young man claims that he had some friends visited last and uh. Well, they disappeared. Ah haha. Well come on in. Please. You know inspector, we're not open yet, so I doubt if they visited this waxwork. You gonna swallow that shit? You, shut up. I'm sorry. You were saying? Yes, well. It's just that it couldn't possibly be this waxwork, unless they broke in after dark. What? Oh, come on! I don't believe this. Of course you can feel free to wonder around if you wish. It would be a pleasure. You, stay here. I wanna show you a waxwork Sit! Oh, this is wonderful. You know, I have always been fascinated with Egyptian history. Yes. It has always been one of my favorites too. Would you like a closer look? It's all rather morbid though, isn't it? Well, it does seem to be what the people want. Yes. I guess you're right. Sure you wouldn't like a personal look? Really. I must be going. You're gonna fall for that? What else do you want me to do? This isn't Russia, you know. Whar are ya going to do? Wait for the next person to disappear, and then the next? Why don't you do something? Listen kid. I know you are worried. Why don't you just go home your friends probably left a message for you there. Now relax. That's it. Never. Never underestimate the political significance of mein kampf as literature... I'm sorry I am late sir. I'm so sick I... I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel nauseous. Uh, Sarah's gonna tell it's an incredibly contagious disease. Excuse me, I gotta get through here. Sarah's got to... You got to come with me to the hospital. to get x-rayed. Come here. I got swollen glands and my tongue is coated. Pustules. It's terrible sir. I think I'm going to puke. Things are going to come as big as possible. I'm sorry sir. I'll bring her back as soon as possible. Come on. You aren't sick! We could get expelled for this! What the fug you doing? Listen. I think I know what is going on. Okay? I went to the waxkork today and met this man. Oh that explains everything. You don't understand. I recognized his face. Big deal. Are you sure you don't want me for call for backup? First I want to see if I am imagining things. 'you alright? I'll let you know. Shit. If my mother caught me up here, she'd kill me. Whose is all this? My grandfather's. Well, most of it anyway. He was a very strange man. He was fascinated by death and horror. My afamily never really aknowledges him, apart from that portrait in the dining room. Sarah. Come over here. Listen to this. Last night, Millionaire Michael Loftmore was found murdered in his drawing room. His body was badly burnt, and he seemd to have died in great pain. The only thing missing from the house was the collection of 36 artifacts. all belonging to Loftmore. ...and the it goes on. Now listen to this. The only clue is the disappearance of Mr. David Lincoln, Loftmore's chief helper of the house. - Well? - Well. "This Mr. Lincoln". And that's the man I saw at the waxwork. That's the same man I originally met, with China. But he hasn't aged. Mark, what's happening? I don't know. but I know where we can find out. Come on Nigel. Just don't stand there. Give me a hand. Come on Nigel. Help the professor darling. This one is a heavy one. Come on Nigel. Give me a hand. Push the darn thing. Rhaoul. The curse. Those who desecrate the tomb of Rhaol will be condemmed to a painful death by hands of... Heavens. It's the mummy. Shit! Let's get the hell out of here. The door! Push up the door. There's a lever here someplace. Have you got gun or anything? Yes in my bag. Probably on the side of the tomb. Don't just lie ther. Open the damn door! Hello Mark! Sit down dear fellow. Sit down. I am. Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brightman. This is Sir Wilfred, my godfather. Hello. Call me Wilfey. Everyone else does. Now. How about a whiskey? Maybe something stronger? No thank your sir, we're fine. So. Now, what's so urgent? Well, it's a long story. Oh , love it. I think Sarah shoould start. Even better. Don't have to look at your ugly mug. Now come on young lady. HaHah. Haven't got all day. Well, it all started when a friend and I... China. China and I were walking to class, in the one neighborhood, and we ran into this man... What the hell did you kill him for? We still need two more. He would've been perfect! That's alright. I'm sorry I shouted. You got to learn your own strength. You're a big boy now. Very big. Hans have better find some new visitors. We're running out of time. Get rid of that. It's useless. Mark found the article in the attic, and uh, about the murder and Mr. Lincoln. And, so that's why he thought we should come and see you. This is very serious. You see your grandfather, bless him, who collected over the years, 18 trinkets. Belong to 18 of the most evil men that have ever been. Well? Divide 18 into 3. 6, 6 and 6 Yes. The number of the Devil. Your grandfather and I were fascinated by all that horror stuff. We talked about it. we played a little. Never took it too seriously. Mr. Lincoln, obviously does. Who is this Mr. Lincoln? Well, he had his own waxwork show in San Francisco, but it failed before he started working with your grandfather. He murders my grandfather 40 years ago, and yet he still doesn't look a day over 50. If you sold your soud to the Devil, you'd never age either. Sell my soul? Any student of black magic can do it. Most of these books will tell you how. So what happens when you have sold out? You've got yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple. Doing what? - Tipping the scales. Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil. I think that our list to Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it. As a fool to belief, if by making a wax effigy of an evil being containing a belonging of his that he possessed in earthly form and feeding him the soul of a believing victim, you can bring him back to life. But what you have discovered is even more terrifying. You see, your grandfather not only collected their belongings, but also a small piece from the dwelling of . What Lincoln has done, is to recreate a whole scene from each character's life. which becomes like a small time vessel. The wholw display is the ghost not just the figures. He does not need to kill anyone, sacrifice, or use spells. He just sits back while the display does it for him, until the day when there were 18 victims. A time when 18 of the most evil souls were ever been... sould live again. Destroying the world, with the help of their possessed. The voodoo and the world. And the dead shall rise and consume all things. Can tis be stopped? Maybe before the event. Never after. WHat can we do? Must burn the waxworks, but most important. The ones that have not yet claimed lives, that way, the chain can never be finished. Now, you must hurry. I wish I could help, but I could only be a hindrance. but You must go now. Come on Sarah. Thank you Sir Wilfred. - Good luck. Tell the others our Mr. Lincoln has been found. It has begun. Why can't we just burn it down from the outside? Right. They douse the flames, and we get arrested for arson. That would be nice. Now, we've got to burn down each displayed ourselves. Let's find our way around back. I can't see a damn thing. Give me my lighter. Don't worry, it's only wax. There's a light switch. Sarah. What are doing? Come on. We have to burn the victims and the displays. Move it! Come on girl. Move it. Sarah. Come on! Bravo! To the divine lunch monkey. Well. Do we go riding or have you something slightly more vigorous for this afternon's entertainment? I don't know about you, your majesty, but I do get so bored with whipping... ...horses. How would you like to ride this little filly until she drops? What a wonderful idea. What fine lines. So fit. So Unbroken. Some day you must show me the rest of your stable. Shall we how long it will take to break her? May I? But of course. Please. Have a seat. What a beautiful sight. No? First, I'm going to warm you up. With the prince's riding prop. And at which, I am going to hand you to the prince and his consults to use you like the whore you are. Then, my beauty, I shall beat you again. Until you die. This isn't real. None of this is real. I was forced here. If I don't believe in you, the you don't exist. Shit, I hope I'm right. Grab him! (Speaking French) I'm sorry. I've never been very good at languages. I've never seen a girl take so much. She's even a bigger whore than her face betrays. They why you stop Marquis? Beat here more. Your highness. If I beat her more, she may not survive, and then you won't have a chance to feel this white virgin flesh. Then we shall pleasure another of your sluts. I want to see this whore die at the whip now. Yes your highness' wishes. Well, my pretty rose. You die. Lucky bitch! That's because she's a virgin and gets to get beaten in front of the English prince. I mean that, we were all virgins once. Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't let him take me. I seems she prefers our company, young man. I must say, your girlfriend gave us quite an entertaining show. What a SLUT she is. Until the girl dies, you don't really exist. You're just trapped in your little world. Your words mean nothing. Oh. Don't be angry just because she had her first orgasm at the end of a whip, and not by your touch. - Sarah, listen to me. - Go away. Remember Tony? China? These people butchered your friends. Don't you understand? You're being possessed. It all started when you looked into the display. These people may have killed your friends, but they can't harm you. Not unless your mind allows them to. Watch. Your friend has quite an imagination. Come on. Shoot me! Hit me! Or are you scared? Afraid to look like a cowrad. Afraid that you might see that the Marquis de Sade can only beat little girls, and can't fight like a real man. See Sarah? Don't look so slug boy. We shall be meeting again. This is the barrier. If you don't believe in all of this, then the barrier... ...it can't stop you. Watch. See? Are you ready? ARE YOU READY? Well it looks like your little plan failed. Just a little precaution. Are you sure they are going to be here? Honey, I know as much as you. Some guy with a squeaky voice called and said meet them here at midnight. They are good, aren't they? I suppose so. Wow, the glasses from "Nutty Zombies from Hell". I gotta have those for my collection. Hey Ge... No one's going to miss them. -They was late. - Shut up and watch. It's done. Live my children Live. Run... ...Run! There's nowhere to run. What the... He's right you know. There is nowhere to run. Even one of hese gets out, the world be contaminated within a few days. Our only chance is to contain them here. Before this whole rotting place is brought to the ground. Enough with it, if we have to. Role here. I am ready. Sir. Jenkins! Good evening sir. Very good. Now these belonged to your grandfather. Use them wisely. Let's make sure that these wise asses are dead before we burn them. James. It's me. Sarah. james, it's me. Sorry. It's okay. - China. What happened? - Shhh. It's okay. I missed you so much. It's altright sir. She, um. Wasn't human you know. She's been dead a long tome. Come on. We've got battles to win. Come on sir. - Kiss me Sarah. - Kiss this! Mark? You've always wanted me. Here's your chance baby. You afraid of me? TAKE ME! Take this. Jenkins! Behind you! Jenkins. Get you some help? Too late for that sir. Give my love to the Mrs. Get those bastards. Get off. Get off me. Quick! He's changing! Make my day. You! You little bastard! Damn. Fire! Fire. Now we shall see. Who is the real man? Kill the whimp. School time is over. Now, you die. Sarah. How romantic. One last thing before you kill us Lincoln. You know my name. I should. You murdered my grandfather. You're a Loftmore. Old lord's grandchild. Well well well what a coincidence. It's such a small world. Well then why do you want to end it? Somebody has to. See you in hell. Thanks! You okay Sarah? Would you like a closer look? Watch out. The flames Go away. I don't . Save yourselves. Oh my goodness. It's our only chance. SUBTITLE CREATED by Carbonerous 2016
