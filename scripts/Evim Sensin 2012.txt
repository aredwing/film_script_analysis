All Right. Clear the way! Clear the way! Doctor Mete Akgn, please go to the surgery room. Excuse me, just a second. I forgot my bag, I'll be right back. Ugh! Master. What are you looking at! Mummy, there's a woman at the door. OK, you go in. Who are you looking for? Are you Tlin? Yes, that's me. I want to apologize. I am the one your man is having an affair with since one year. I just found out, that he is married. I swear, I didn't know. I wanted to break it off and he did this to me. I really want to apologize. Mum! Darling. Take one of them. It's good against headache. Don't cry my love. Mum, how am I supposed to look dad into his eyes. Look, what happened, happened. But now you're with us. You'll see, dad will forgive you, too. Daddy, please forgive me. I beg you, forgive me. Nothing I ever do is right! Please, forgive me! Dad! Dad, you have to forgive me! Don't be another man to kill me, dad! I wanted to send you off myself! You played with my honor! How could I forgive you? You have brought shame on me. I've been fooled, dad! I swear, I was fooled. Dad! Dad, you will send me off this house yourself. But I am begging you... ...please dad forgive your daughter. OK, I'll be there in about an hour. Dash it... Come on girl, hurry up, I'll be late for the construction site. It'll be ok, if you, could stay still, dad. Wow, wow, wow. How this color fits me. Huh? Doesn't it? So from now on I will be wearing the suits my daughter tailors for me. Yes! Why are you spending so much money on your wardrobe anyway. You're right. Stop, leave it! You'll tear off what you sewed yourself. - I'll be late for the construction site, hurry. - Ah, dad? - What? - You are forgetting your lunch promise. OK, let's go to the construction site, we'll go from there. The carpenters made troubles. Shall I take off the jacket? Take it off. Take care of the needles. Ah! You have to take off the needles first. - OK. - The trouser is slipping, wait. Don't worry, it won't take long. Come on, dad. I am starving. The planks are wet it has been raining for a week. No, the planks aren't wet! I know the boss, my friend. I won't set up the scaffold with these planks. Do you know, the costs for each day of this construction site? - You are wasting our time. - What is it, Harun? Sir, it's been raining for a week. The planks are soaking. Harun insists on setting up the scaffoldings. And I say, I won't. They're exaggerating, boss, there's no such thing. I checked it, the planks are inside and bone- Look and see if they're dry? I can't risk anyone's life here! If you want me to set up a scaffolding with this material... ...you'll do it yourself! Sir, the planks are still wet. - They won't even carry one man. - Who are you? I am Iskender, Sir. The chief of this team. - Hello, Erol! - We're screwed Leyla, we're screwed! Why, what happened? The carpenter ran away. - How come? - I'll ask him how if I see him. We have to open the shop in one week... ...and I am nailing the shelves all by myself. And I broke my finger doing this man's job. Help Leyla, help! OK, wait! Don't panic. We'll fix it. ...and couldn't finish those bits and bobs for months. I hate this donkey work. Don't worry. Dad will send you his best man, he promised. But the man is said to be al little ratty don't you push him too far! The last thing I need is to be beaten up by a carpenter. OK, he arrived. Did they send one man only. Will one man do all the work now. Shush. - Where's the job? - Well- Welcome. This way but let's drink a tea before. Well. There was a worker, but he left us. Actually there is not much work, when do you think you can finish? What are you doing? I am working on that for two days! The plasterboards are sloping. First we have to fix them. What! Don't break the plasterboards! Where should I find plasterboards now? Leyla! Are you ok? I'm fine. What are you doing with so many pens? Are you selling them? I usually forget my pens. - Do you have a car? - No. I'll take the bus from here. I assume there's passing one. Is there passing one? Are we going this way? And what if it's going to snow on the way? What's this? I'll tell my father to get your marquee fixed. Are you beating people with the cane over there? Why are you beating people? I'm sorry. Why? Because I yelled at you last time. OK, ok I'm quiet. You don't speak anyway. You can keep the blanket. Thank you. I am freezing. - Where is the tea, man? - Well, somewhere. Is the tea cold again, man! I just could rescue them from the plasterers. You've made them look like a star. If we should get ourselves a samowar? You're saying the same thing every time. You were not able to buy us a samowar. What shall I do pay for it myself? Goddamn! There the sack goes. If you are not able to carry that... ...why are you loading up that much. What am I supposed to tell the boss now? Well, even if he doesn't pay that much. Isn't it time for lunch? I soaked up drinking water the whole day. Thank you. Take this. Take this. Are we going to drink Ayran? This will blow us up like a balloon. - Let's have a coke instead. - What is it?! There's no coke. Drink your Ayran if you don't mind. Where do you know that they will come here? I know it, because they are coming every night. - I have to pee! - Then go to the restroom. Are you crazy? You don't think that I'll use the restroom here. - Ugh! - Right, right. Hold it. Leyla, why did you take us here anyway! What! You're talking all the time! Be a little quiet! Those ones? - I am starving... - I am hungry as well. I can smell it from here. Why are you wearing those glasses? Kamil the glasses? Are you going to drink Rak again. What shall we do Kamil, drink turnip juice? Wouldn't be that bad, huh? These guys are just rednecks! Look at that, man. Did they come here before? - She's looking at me! - Why would she do that! - She's smiling! - Why should she smile. - You scared the shit out of her. - No such thing! Yes, what are we going to eat, Sirs? - A spicy Adana kebab for me. - And you? - One and a half. - And you? Meat balls for me. - Check please. - Right away, Lady. Are you also here? We came here because the meatballs... ...are so fine. Actually, it's good that I've seen you. I wanted to thank you. I still have your blankets. Blankets? Come if you have time. Sirs. Handsome! When are you going to ask for our girl's hand? He won't marry. He's got a lot of money. He's saving his money. Idiot! That's the boss' daughter. Come on, let's go. I'm freezing! - Where are you going? - Right. Look at them! Sweetie. I'm gonna cry. Not for me. If you drink that... ...we'll be lovers. And if not? We'll be strangers for the rest of our lives. A date? We should contribute. - This way. - Why. Look, you have to start with the red ones. Then you have to throw in the colored ones. The black one has the highest points. OK? - Uh-huh. - You get it? - I get it. - Ugh. - Come on, come on. Take care. Hit it! Do you want to hit again? Don't they get bored here? They will forget within three seconds where they are. Pitty. What's this caravan outside? I lived in it for years. Now it's broken. I'll move in again, when it's fixed. - What are you doing? - Shush. - I'm writing something. - You're writing something. What are you writing? Won't tell you. What's this? Iskender, what is this? Give it back to me. Iskender, what was that? Nothing. Who's this? Your grandpa? My master. I've learned everything about carpenting from him. - Don't you have any other pictures? - No. - Even no childhood photos? - No. I was born like this. Nonsense, people aren't born like this? I did. From where are you? You know, my father is from Izmir, my mother from Trabzon. I love the Black Sea cuisine. Do you know Mhlama? That's the only dish I don't know but I know all the rest. And besides I can sing songs from the Black Sea very well. You? Songs from the Black Sea? Sing. I'm too shy, I can't. - Come on, you said it yourself, come on sing. - No. Besides, I can't sing on cue. OK. But you won't laugh, ok? Promise, I won't laugh. My friends and I are fishing. There's a song I am singing when we sell the fish for our bread and butter. It's nothing for ladies, and sirs like you are. Sing, sing! If you want it that much I'll sing that song for you. So, I'm not the one to blame. # Hey girl did you get yourself fish or a husband? # Hey girl did you get yourself fish or a husband? # Were you blind? # Oh, oh little girl. # Did you get him at night? Did you get him at night? What's this smell? What have you put on? Why? I don't know. It reminds me of my childhood. I can't describe it but it's something peaceful. The barber has put it on. It will remind you of me from now on. # You were my love. # The one I loved. # We promised to death. # You were mine. # It has been written for us. # This bitter fate. # We made a promise we couldn't keep. # We couldn't keep. # I wish you will never forget me. # That you'll be my love until death. There are thousands of shops why don't you go and... buy some jackets for him, you made a mannequin out of me. Erol, be quiet for God's sake! You make my head ache. Aren't you hurrying a little bit? Why? It's my usual speed. It's almost done. I don't mean that, I mean that Iskender. Also, I don't understand you at all. What do you find in bears like him? You can't understand that, dear Erol. - Idiot! - Tawdry! "Remember me each time you wear this. " What's his name? Who's name, dad? The name of the man that turned you into a fool. There's no such man, dad. - Did you say it? - I did not say anything. Why are you going to introduce us? We didn't reach that level yet, dad. What do you mean, isn't he worth yours and our families? No, don't think that, dad. What's he doing? He's an architect. Architect? And I thought he was a construction worker or so. Defne! Are you ok? Don't talk nonsense? Aren't you ever going to get to know my dad? - I know you, isn't that enough? - Will you be able to live without me? I did it till now. This means I will be able. You can't know without trying? You are talking as if you had been married a thousand times. Where do you know, I didn't? Also, even if we got married you would leave me. - I won't leave you. - But you can leave slowly, if you like. Your father shouldn't see us like that. He won't come to the construction site today. There's no such thing like lifelong happiness. Come on, don't cry snotty-nosie. Dad wants to meet his son-in-law, what's the problem? Are you crazy, girl? What marriage. You don't think about the situation, you brought me in, do you? And what is so bad about a young girl... ...who wants to marry the man she loves? Here! Use this. So you can reach the sweets, and break your own shells. You're frightening me. I am frightening you? You are too self-confident. You don't know what life is like. I have been left for my whole life. I grew up on the streets. Assuming we married. You will leave me, too. And I can't stand that. I won't leave you. OK, don't cry. Dad! What do you think, you are doing? How do you dare? Son, this is the place you earn your bread and butter. Is this right? Does your family know it? So, talk son! Have you introduced my daughter to them? Do they know about it? My daughter is not someone you can fool around with. Where are you living? Who are you, son? You are right, Sir. I can't give your daughter anything. Go and tell that to her, too. You're fired! Leyla! She fainted because of stress. She is also anemic. And they prescribed something, some medicine. If she takes them regularly... ...her immune system will be more resistant. If I told you that I will never leave you? Could you love me then? I wanted to take a shower. I left it on, I forgot. OK, then come and rub my back. Are you crazy, get out! I am taking a shower. No you have lost that right. OK, come, hold my hand. Is it good? What are you writing again? I won't say - Say it! - I won't. I'm gonna kill you, say it. No, I won't say it. Say it! Come on. - No. - I'm going to kill you. - I won't. - I will kill you. - I won't say it. - I'll kill you, say it now. Iskender, come and let me introduce Hakk Bey to you. Your father-in-law talked a lot about you. I wanted to meet you, too. We agreed with Selim Bey. We're going to build a holiday resort that consist of bungalows. The job is yours. I knew it, I knew it, this is great news, my love, I am so happy. Leyla! Could you come over and have a look, please. I'll be right there. Darling! I'll see you tonight, kiss you, bye-bye. - Iskender, wake up, you slept again. - Let me sleep a little more, please. Iskender? Do you love me? What are you talking about? What is it, you are so in such a good mood early in the morning? Stupid! Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Come here! "This man belongs to Leyla. " - Good morning. - Good morning, master. Huh, birdy. It's going to rain, cover the materials. OK, master. What are you looking at? Nothing, master. Why are you laughing, man! Come and sit down! You're sticking at the windows for two hours. You'll get varicosis. Who am I talking to, Leyla? She's become so weird. Take off your bag at least. Don't worry there are no pick-pocketers here. I forget it everywhere. I'm fine this way. Are you ok? I don't know? My arm feels numb? Zeynep could you rub my arm? Of course, my dear. I'll do it but... Our brother-in-law should rub you so that you can recover again. Look at you! Leyla? Are you ok, my dear? Did you faint in the last times? Were you in stressful situations? I have anaemia, I am fainting from time to time. Don't hesitate, these information are important for us. I was together with a married man. But I just learned that he was married. I went to see his wife that day. It was very hard for me. I apologized to her. I wanted her to know. What you are going through right now seems to be stress based. Stress is effecting everybody in a different way. But nevertheless you should come to see me next week again. I will do some tests. We have to take the excavation there. - The other way - - Master! This woman there wants to see you. OK, Iskender, we'll carry on later. I told you that I was not going to disturb you again but... ...that's the last time, promise. I need money. I am messed up. If I can't find... ...believe me, I wouldn't have come to you if it wasn't my last choice. If you help me, I'll go and never come back again, promise. This will be our living-room. I am going to build a fireplace right here. In winter we can enjoy the view and sit at the fire place. Exactly how you wanted it, we'll have a living-room and a stove. - And the chestnuts will be roasted on it. - Yes. Listen, what I am saying? We should build a room for guests here. So they can see the forest. And on this side will be the garden. We'll sow tomatoes, paprika, eggplants and so on. One part could be a vegetable garden, huh? What do you think? Leyla? Shall this be our bedroom? Looks like an enjoyable place to sleep. Do you like it that much? Yes. It's so peaceful. - Thank you. - For what? You are making me so happy. You now will have a proper home for yourself, too. You are my home. I started to work with him when I was a child. He taught me the whole roughness of life. It's no lie if I said, he brought me up. He was mad at me... ...has hit me... ...he always was an old stubborn man. I don't remember that he ever looked fondly to me. When I did something wrong he used to hit me on my hands. He has hurt me a lot. But whatever I learned I learned from him. Master, it's me. Iskender. I recognized you, buster. I brought my wife to you. She wanted to meet you. Son of a donkey. Do you bring your wife after you married her? Come my little one, come my girl, sit down. Hello Sir, I'm Leyla. Come and sit down, my little one. Take this! Go and sandpaper thoroughly. So that the shapes come out, go, go. And bring two tea glasses. You know where to find them. He'll be a carpenter one day but I won't see it. What a beautiful girl you are. Did he introduce you to his mother? Pardon me? Your mother-in-law I mean. He couldn't ever get rid of his hatred towards her. If you want to be a wife to him, save him from this hatred. I thought she was dead! You can't really call it living. Her name is Zeliha Akdoan. You can find her in one of the cheap hotels in Tarlaba. - Thank you. - Good day. Is there a Zeliha Akdoan staying at your hotel? Please don't! God damn you! Don't! I told my son. So many times. Go on! What is it? Are you ok? What happened? She is you mother! I have no mother! She is your family, Iskender! You are my family. She is not my mother. Especially not my family. - You have to help her. - Why? I saved that money for the two of us. Why should give it to a woman who threw me out on the street. Iskender, she needs you. I needed her, too! - Iskender, your hand is bleeding! - Leave it! You don't know her. You couldn't leave her behind but... ...she threw me on the streets when I was five years old. You don't know who you are defending! Iskender, your hand is bleeding. Iskender, please don't! Don't hurt yourself. Do you know why I'm never crying? I cried for days after she had left me. And then I swore that I would never cry again. You don't know what that woman made me suffer. I only want you to get rid of your hatred. You have a huge palace in your heart. You have taken everybody in there but you are shivering outside. Forgive her if you love me. You are mad at me. You are mad at life. But you are forgetting that I also have my madnesses. You are not the only one who lost his childhood. I've lost my childhood, too. When I gave you birth, I was a child. I was as daft as a brush. God damn the day I gave you birth. I wish you wouldn't have been born. I wish, I wasn't born. Did you come to see me in this state? I'm no longer your mother. Get out! How much does she owe you? How much? Hundred thousand. Are you going to drink Raki? We'll drink together. I don't want to. If you drink this we'll be happy for our whole life. And if not? We won't have a home any more. I thought I was your home? Here! My love. I told you to come in one week. Not in three! Are you an only child? I have a sister. How old is she? Nineteen. Maybe twenty. I'm mixing it up sometimes. What is today's date? Are you asking the same question again and again sometimes? Did you ever get lost on your way home? Do you often lose your things? What's up, Erol? Erol, are you ok? He came! It's been a while. All right. I'll start. There was no use in staying here after the divorce. I went away from Istanbul for a long time. I worked at our London branch office. When they called me back again I only agreed for one reason. To ask you forgiveness. Look, I am sorry, that I've hurt you. Actually you fainted. You hit your head. Nevertheless I am guilty of having stressed you. Look at our destiny! I got divorced... ...and you got married. I forgot about everything. Let's just do our job. When did you arrive? - Are you looking for something? - No. Did you do those? What did the doctor tell you? Nothing. He told me to come again in a week. Your tissue and blood test results are unfortunately very bad. Which means? We determined a decrease in your brain cells. Talk in a language I can understand, doctor. Cadasil. This means a variation of dementia. We can call it senility. Senility? I am only twenty seven years old. What senility? This is possible. Cadasil can be seen at young ages, too. In Japan a thirteen year-old child had the same disease. You are one of those rare patients. What's going to happen with me? I mean, the cure? Are you working? Yes. Quit work. You even won't be able to answer the phone very soon. You are at a very critical point. Wouldn't it get better if I had a surgery? I wish it would. But you have to prepare yourself. That you feel numb sometimes... ...the acute headache... ...the faints... ...the oblivion. Your disease is responsible for all that. You will forget to dress, the way home and... ...even the closest people to you. And this will increase. This means, ...before the physical death... ...the cerebral death will begin. My love. You are writing something on me again, but... ...I only could catch, my love. I didn't get the rest. Do you want me to quit work? Whatever you want, sweetie. Quit of course. I'll provide for you. Is there something that makes you nervous? Shall we have a child? I don't know? Never thought about it. Are you ok? Do it. What? That. What? Do you want to make love? That. A massage? Wait, I'll bring you your hot water bag. Ah! Trample on us master, trample on us. Let us get be constipated from eating Lahmacun every day... ...you show up with your tucker-bag. Shut up, man! His wife cooked for him, buster. Get married and you'll have one, too. Just a second, Sirs, I have enough of eating Lahmacun every day. - Take this, I don't want it. - Give it to me. - I'll eat some home cooking. - Oh! There's rice. I bet, there's white beans in the other one. Did we have onions? No, we don't. No, that's not white beans. Rice in both of it... ...give me back my Lahmacun. - I won't give them back. - Come on! What happened? You were constipated, I thought? Doctor, I'll kill you! What are you saying, hu! Are you sure? Are you crazy, man? Why should I lie to you? Go and show her to any doctor if you don't believe me. You could have mixed it up with the file of another patient. You could have diagnosed wrong. There's nothing wrong. Leave me in peace. What are you saying, man? How can such a young person suffer from such a disease? - What kind of doctor are you? - Pull yourself together, man. I lost my wife because of this disease. I spent the most part of my life with researching this disease. You have to accept this reality. Your anger won't change anything. You have to prepare yourself and her to what's going to happen. The disease will progress very fast. Am I the reason? Am I the reason, why you quit your job? Listen, there's no need for that. Let's go to a nice place, and talk about that. We have to talk about all of our problems. Look, I want to go back with you to two years ago. Two years ago? Yes. We didn't know each other two years ago... ...what are you saying, Mehmet? You have to take care. There have to be thirteen red balls on the table but there are fifteen. Have you learned it? What? There's a rubber in my head. It rubs away everything. Now you know it, too. We have to separate. Bullshit! What the hell are you talking about. You told me that I was going to leave you one day. You didn't forget that. How could I. You said it. Does this mean, that you are leaving me? Not me, but my mind. Soon I won't remember anything. I am so scared. I'll remember for both of us. Would that be ok? If we separate right now we won't get hurt that much. What meaning has love anyway when the memories have gone? You don't need to be nice to me. Very soon I won't remember anything. Leave me, Iskender. OK. Put that ball in there, I promise I will leave you. Why are you crying? I thought you wouldn't cry, snotty-nosie. I won't even remember why you are with me. I won't even know why you are loving me. I will always know. I will lose everything for what you are loving me, Iskender. My eyes, my smile, my soul. I won't recognize you. I won't remember my memories, I won't even know who you are. I will always know who you are. When did we get married? In February. The day? The eighth? What's my name? Iskender. And yours? Leyla. Be careful. Stay away from the kitchen. - OK? - OK. Don't be late tonight. Why? Do you want to go out? You seem to forget? Today's your mother's birthday. Maybe you should go and see my crazy doctor, too? OK. You forgot those. Come in. Are you alone? Are you hungry? Shall I prepare something for you? Why are you confusing me? Let's go somewhere and talk. Sit down, we can talk. I'll make you a coffee. Leyla! What was that in the office? Look, it isn't right that we are talking here. You are married, you'll get into trouble when your husband comes. My husband? Am I married? Mehmet, you're going to leave me again, right? Mehmet, don't leave me, please. What are you doing, are you crazy? Who is that man? He wants to come back to me. I'm happy for you. Are you feeling well? Very well. Iskender! Why didn't she tell us? I don't know. She didn't want you to know. What does that mean? She is my daughter. - Did she hide it from me? - Selim. We'll take her with us. I won't leave her. You don't know what you are going to go through. You're still young. Leave her to us. Go and live your life. She belongs to here. She is my wife. Iskender listen to reason. This is too much for you. You can't cope with that. Please, stop it. You should go now. Sister! What are you doing here? Leyla! Leyla, it's me, your mother. Open the door, my little one. I beg you, open the door. Leyla! My sweetie, please open the door. What happened to your shoulder? Iskender, let me go inside. Leyla! The windows should be very big, ok? I want it to be bright. Everything you want. Come on, it's getting cold. I'll take you home. OK. Mehmet! I love you. I love you, too. Prepare peaceful atmospheres for her. It is important that the patient keeps away from stress. I know how you feel. Don't let it defeat you. The first memories to get lost, are the newest ones. But they will all get erased slowly. She called me with the name of her ex-boyfriend. And she said, I love you. Who does she really love? Does she want to go back to her old days. Is that true? I don't know. You got her love. Not me. I love you, too. "Forgive me" I'm sorry, very sorry. I never wanted to break your heart. Oh my god, what have I done? I am Leyla. I only love Iskender. Are you crying right now? Please don't cry. I never wanted to see you crying or suffering. I just wanted to make you happy. But at the end all I could give you was pain. Iskender... ...my love. Please don't get me wrong. I loved you only. I thought of you only. And I remembered you only. I'd die to show you my heart. I am afraid, I will lose the memories that came back, again. And there are so many things I want to tell you. I love you and I feel sorry. Very sorry. I met you because of my oblivion. And I'm leaving you because of my oblivion. You are the most beautiful thing that happened to me. - Leyla! - I don't need to remember you. You are a part of me. I am smelling like you, laughing like you. Am looking like you. I may forget you but nothing can tear you out of me. My heart will always be one with you. You will live there until I die. How could I ever forget you? Even if you never said that you loved me... ...deep in my heart I know, you are loving me. Please forgive me that I am leaving you. You are so cruel. Couldn't you give me another chance? What am I supposed to do now? I'm lonely again. Understand me! I will not get divorced. I beg you tell me where she is. It's better this way. She is our child. We suffer much more than you. It's the best for both of you to leave her with us. Look, you're still young. Go and make a good life for yourself. Now, go home. She is my home and my life. I will fall apart... ...if you take her from me. I won't be able to get back on my feet again. I sent her to the US. She'll get a long lasting therapy there. Forget her! Go. You were a very stubborn child, you know? I wasn't able to restrain you. I was very afraid of that temper of yours. But after a while, I realized that you are very much like me. As I did you got stubborn... ...when something was said to be impossible. This was why I didn't let you go. I am your father. If I can't protect you, stay behind you... ...what kind of father am I? You are my first-born. Maybe that's why we are holding us so dear. You used to fall on your knees, you know? Then you came with the ointment and wanted me to apply it. And after I applied it I had to blow for minutes. One night... ...you were in the garden with your mother and saw a falling star. You started to cry saying that it would fall on me. I was in Ankara that day when your mother called me. She said you were crying. That you were stubborn. That you weren't sleeping. I came back hastily. You eyes were bloodshot. Yes, you didn't sleep... ...and you didn't eat. When you saw me... ...you looked at me... ...came to me... ...looked with that teary eyes at me... ...touched my cheeks with your tiny hands... ...and curling your lips, you said... ...daddy, don't go... ...don't go, daddy... ...don't go. Don't go my child. Don't go. Don't go my child. Don't go! Mum! Where are you? Don't leave me! Mum! Mum! Where are you? Mum! Don't go, mum. Defne? Are you ok? What happened? You have to see her, Iskender! She needs you. She never left. She was always here. I was scared of my dad, I couldn't tell you. I found this paper in her hands the other day. She wrote it to you but forget to send it. My love... ...my one and only. I wanted to write you before my mind leaves me again. I feel better today. Or I think that I do. The swing door we met with you... ...the billiard saloon... ...the stories you told me, your look, your smell, your anger... ...I remember everything. Speaking of your anger... ...don't lose it, that's the only thing that makes you strong. Don't worry about me. Find yourself someone nice and be happy. You don't know that but... ...you were a good husband. I know that... ...because I was your wife. Yes Sir, how can I help you. Where are you going, lad! One second, man where are you going? I love you. I love you very much. I'm here my love. I'm here my love. I came to take you with me. I will never let you go again. It's over, you don't need to be afraid. # You were my love. # The one I loved. # I loved you to death. # You were my one and only. # Destiny has split our ways. # What shall we do, love we couldn't make our home. # I see, this love will burn me and you. # We drifted apart my love for eternity. You said, you wouldn't leave me? Liar! What are you writing again? I won't say. - Say it. - I won't. - I'll kill you, say it. - No, I won't say it. Say it. C'mon say it. - No. - I'll kill you. - I won't say. - I'll kill you. - I won't say it. - I'll kill you, say it now! I want to stay with you until I die. Did you write this? Uh-huh. And after you die? I won't leave if you don't want me to. So you're going to be a ghost. Why are you writing such scary things. Can't you think of something more beautiful? Like flowers, bugs, fields, gardens. Write such things. - I'll do. - I'll do! Wait! - Wait! - Stop that!
