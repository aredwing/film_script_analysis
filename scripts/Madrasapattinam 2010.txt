You have to find with the help of the name. Don't you have any option? What if we bring a photo taken recently? With that we can match with the voters ID list. We can find out in 1/2 an hour. - There is no chance then. - Why sir? In the voters ID list you give, no photo in that looks like us! I don't draw any pictures to any one generally. Murali sir has come and asked me... ...and I couldn't deny. How much will it cost? I don't ask any money as God has given me this art. Still, it will cost 70 rupees for the paint and brush. - You can pay me for that. - 70 rupees. I don't ask any money extra. You wait for 1/2 an hour. 7... 13... Run! - Thank god! She has gone. - Thank god we have escaped. We want to thank her. They are thanking you. We only thank you. If you don't come... If you didn't save me...

When I am with you the time is not enough. I didn't talk anything to you... ...and I did not have anything to say now. Why so? The night is not dawned yet. ...and the day has not come to an end. Why so? I'll graze many donkeys. What is your ambition? I'll become a big launderer like my dad. - And you? - I'll become a wrestler like lyya kannu What is your ambition?

This is the moment where dawn awaits... Will it dawn for us? Even when ghosts and foxes chase... Even if the path is full of obstructions A flower blooms in the war field amidst chaos Hail Mother India One sky is not enough Wish for many skies to flee Dream for a long life Let us hold our hands And stay united forever War throughout day and nights A cuckoo sings faraway Hearts feel elated at hearing it Though at opponent sides But nothing stops us from falling in love Even a thousand weapons can't fight against love Darkness will vanish. Brightness at dawn in the east. Even when ghosts and foxes chase... Even if the path is full of obstructions A flower blooms in the war field amidst chaos Dampness in the breeze increases... Tears in the eyes joins the breeze... We were two... Now have become one Ours is an affectionate bond We've joined hands at the cost of tears Don't kill him. I want to speak with him.
