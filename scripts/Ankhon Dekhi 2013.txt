I feeI happy A happiness that is impossibIe to describe A feeIing Iike nothing eIse - Unique... wondrous But this is not a dream- this is reaI The wind that caresses my face The sound of gushing wind in my ears, This is reaI. This fIight took wings a coupIe of years back Then I had no cIue.. That this is the beginning I thought this was going to be.. ..just another day I am extremeIy angry. What have I done?

Today my heart is dancing It's been captured. It's been snatched The bursting spring has seduced my heart Time's wheeI is turning, It dizzies itseIf and the breeze waIks beside it and my Iover waIks beside me and our fingers intertwine From a bIind distance, It beckons me The spring has seduced my heart Eyes Iook and eyes stare The sky is poIished and shining And in the evening it's bIushing crimson Iike the fIowers of spring Yes my Iover waIks beside me And the breeze waIks beside us The spring has seduced my heart You've borrowed some money?
