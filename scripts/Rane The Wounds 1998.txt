The wounds had started|to bleed again. l felt they were biting their|way through the bandages. A matter of calibre, folks. A calibre from which|wounds barely heal. shvaba liked that calibre.|A guy with taste. Good to see you again, paI. shvaba, my buddy. Never mind the... what do|you caII it? -Consequences. No, when the situation is|reaIIy fucked. -Circumstances. That's the word.|Fuck it, The important thing is|that we're together again. I've always believed that|shvaba would've been able to say lots of funny|and interesting things... Get the fuck out of|the way, you mice! ...if it hadn't been for|his war with words. That's why l guess, it's up|to me to tell this story. Let's go back five years.|Buckle up, folks, we're off. BELGRADE, SERBIA..|AUTUMN, 1 991 . Starring: W o U N D S shvaba and me grew up|in a really dodgy area. Breeze blocks, folks,|if you know what I mean? If you don't,|who gives a fuck? We have to decide|who pIays who. Why do I aIways have|to be the Croat? Your oId man was a Croat. A Slovenian. -Same shit,|different wrapping. What's wrong with you? DiaboIa... -We're not kids|any more to be throwing stones at each other. -Your|Mum's Slovenian, isn't she? I've heard that SIovenians|fuck themseIves senseIess. Shvaba's joking,|they onIy give good head. Suck my dick! Ustashan cunt! Ustashan cunt! Kosovian! Kosovian! Kosovian... Cunt! Kosovian! DiaboIa. Cunt! I'm not a Croat! You're not a Serb either!|Serbs don't cry Iike pussies. Get it?|-Yes. Bro', d'you hear that?|ours are coming! Serbia! Now you're fucked! That autumn, everyone in|our neighbourhood was into watching the tanks|on their way to croatia. Well, almost everyone. Those damn tanks,|Iook at the fiIth! My Mum wasn't to|keen on them. It's a shame about|aII those fIowers... My dad was angry with the|army for forcing him into early retirement. Thirty|fucking years waiting for war and he didn't even|get a look in. Granny, they're great, eh? shvaba's Granny wasn't|very keen on them either. Of course, for Granny|the war was just a re-run. Good morning, neighbour. If you spiII that pigs swiII|down here again, you'II have to give me head and Iick the|terrace at the same time! You bitch! This isn't your|shithoIe Dubrovnik, this is Serbia! -Whimp!|-Serbia, you trash! Learn what's Iaw|and order! You've mixed it aII up.|Her Iate husband was a Croat, she's our. -ours, my arse,|with such behaviour! You'd be better off getting|your gun and defending those peopIe there.|-Fuck you! But they retired you, whimp. Because you're not right|in the head. -Fuck you! Besides the tanks|and the news, everyone in the neighbourhood|was into dijabola's Mum. Lydia works on TV, folks. she'll be important for|our story much later. For now, remember her well,|just like l did. What are you doing,|you idiot! -Son! somehow it happened that|l started wanking that year. At the same time we were|shelling Vukovar. Go for it...|Go for it. They'II destroy the town. When we get rid of|the Ustasha's, we'II buiId a nicer one,|Iike Paris. The liberation|of serbian Vukovar from the jaws|of the Ustashan monster is becoming|an inevitable reality. Paris, my arse. Even better.|Isn't that right, UgIjesha? The citizens are coming|out of their cellars greeting their liberators|with flowers, tears of joy and a thousand and|one thanks. A year later we were|shelling sarajevo. And we were put|under sanctions. You'II see! When the CIA|get their sateIIite pictures and see that we've piIed|the beef on under sanctions! CIington! One of the greatest crimes in|the history of civilisation: Yugoslavia has been|severely punished by the international police. But unjust and unprovoked|sanctions won't brake serbia, whose people|are fond of saying: No one can harm us, we are|stronger than destiny, let them hate us,|those who don't like us... The wisdom fo the people|is much more powerful than American forces. He's Iocked himseIf|in again! Son... When I put the toiIet under|sanctions, you'II shit outside the buiIding.|Come out of there! l couldn't have given a toss|about sanctions or the war. Literally, folks. l was wanking five times|a day at least! Come out of there!|-Son, are you aII right? What does life has to offer|a thirteen-year-old lad? Just wanking! Come out of there before|you faII down the bog! ABoUT IDoLS My dad had|idols, too. At first he slobbered|over some croat Tito. Then he had a thing for|Milosevic, like everyone else|in our neighbourhood. Neighbour be quiet! -Come|and see what I'm hanging up. If you don't Iike it, I'II|hang you on my todger, mate! BIoody oppositionist! Son, have you got|a bad stomach again? Fucking democrats! Is that|quiet enough, eh?! The things us kids loved were|a lot more down to earth. Our only hero was the|neighbour from across the way. How was it? crazy Kure! Just back from|a business trip to Germany. The West is a miracIe.|I'II take you there sometime. I want to go to Munich. Munich, Frankfort,|DusseIdorf, CoIogne... Shvaba, come here! Did anyone pick on you, eh?|Look at this! Thanks, uncIe Kure!|-UncIe Kure! ShaII I wash your|car for you? Take a hike, four eyes! What are you staring at,|Shvaba? Take that in! Can Pinki give us a hand?|-Him? Versace... Yeah, aII right.|Come on, Shvaba. Pinki, your Dad wants you.|-Don't worry Mrs, I'II make them some custard.|Who gave you that siIIy name? My oId man. As a child, my dad was into|partisans, revolution, take an oath,|child-warriors... That gets to you, you know? Bandits! Bandits! Bandits! shit! comrade Pinki... suck my dick,|comrade Stojan! They say that real Pinki|was good with bombs. Maybe. This one prefers shooters,|folks! Where was I...? Oh yes, how did l|get my name. l was born on 4th May 1 980, the same day that|croat Tito croaked. We bawled our eyes out,|folks. Go on son, have a god cry. We'II name you after him: Tito... S. Mucibabic. Luckily, they were shocked|in the city hall. They wanted to arrest him for|insulting the dead President. AII right comrades,|I've changed my mind, Let's caII him Ramiz. No, Pinki, caII him Pinki! Pinki! l was marked for life,|folks! l knew l was destined|for great deeds. That reaIIy suits you. Hey, kid! Take that off|and come here. Get a good Iook, eh? It seems you'd shag my|IittIe girI, wouIdn't you? Come on now, Kure. of course you wouId. Kure, send the kids home.|-What for? Let them Iearn something.|-Come on! D'you know how to treat|this sort of bird? D'you take her|to a museum, eh? What wouId you do in|a museum, you IittIe trash? Have you ever wondered why|there's no shagging in oId American fiIms?|That's because Kagny and Bogy didn't want to give away|their trade secrets. Spit your gum out! Shagging is an art. Pay|attention! First stage: the neck. A serious job,|three to eight seconds. Kure... -Come on!|Look here... PIease don't, not|in front of the kids. Second stage,|the anaesthetic. The ear: ten to|fifteen seconds! What are you staring at,|you IittIe bastards? Get off! Don't interrupt me!|Where was I? Where was I?!|-The anaesthetic. Third stage, fantasy! Hand... crowIing,|crowIing... -Fuck you. Look, the anaesthetic's|aIready working. -Fuck you. You fucking bustard, Kure! Look what you've done,|you wanker! What a temper! I'm gonna marry her,|reaIIy I am. -ReaIIy? You cow! Come here. ReaIIy?|-Come here. Does it hurt? Don't be ridicuIous. But why didn't you teII me|it was bothering you? You're so strange. Look how stressed out I am,|I'm aII shaky. -CooI down. Kids, go home. UncIe Kure, are you|gonna fuck now? Kevin Keegan! Kure isn't a maniac.|Shut the door... My sweetie. My wounded hand is crowIing...|-You're tickIing me. Shagging is an art. Of course Uncle Kure was|a maniac, someone who lives at a hundred miles an hour, who doesn't give a fuck|about anything. Mother, buy me a gun,|to kiII my man, who cheats on me every night. Mother, buy me a syringe,|to overdose my man. shvaba was also a bit like|that - a maniac. A quiet lad, but there was no screwing|around with him. KiII him Shvaba, kiII him,|bash his brains out! HeeI, Shvaba, heeI! That's probably why|Kure liked him. Drop it! To cut my man's throat, 'cos|he cheats on my every night, mother, buy me a knife. Mother, a knife! Go on, sing! Carry on! Keep going! You see, in school|l had all A's. That's why for me weapons|took second place! Even third.|ln first place were... That's the most important|thing for business. Pepper's a reaI geezer! As if, you know!|Take this shit away. And there was work|all over Europe. You're Iying through your|fucking teeth. Get Iost, Rex! A few of us were in fact|representing serbian culture. CooI down, Kure.|-Shut it! We were building up|this country's image. Listen to this cant|taIking out of this arse! We used to watch|''The Beat of the Street'' every Wednesday at Kure's.|For us kids it was as popular as ''Beverly Hills'',|even more than ''Red Star''. l still have fond memories|of some of those trips. Frakfort on Mine, Munich,|dusseldorf, Bundesbank, Offenbach, piggy bank,|dortmund... He's the biggest fucking|cunt grass. Grassing peopIe up took|first, second and third pIace with you, mate!|-You know, in the West, a serb was treated like|a gentleman. I'II put an end to this|boIIocks, you cunt! SEVEN DAYS LATER And now our neighbour|Lydia returns to our story. Here she is, foIks,|isn't she a star? Lydia used to bring all the|top criminals, mobsters, our idols in fact,|onto her programme. Let's see which sIime-baII's|on this week. Look at him!|Are you counting, Shvaba? Who, l hope, would open his|heart to you and to me. Stole, draw! Where did she get this|peasant from? He shouIdn't be|on a kids show! Are you counting, Svaba? At that time we fought|according to a certain code, fists only, but it wasn't|always fair play. Here's an example|for your viewers. Stole, you cant!|What a gentleman! And what about poor Zvonce,|whom you shot from behind!? God rest his souI. Don't upset yourseIf Kure,|pIease! -Who's getting upset? Who?|-Don't, Kure! Give us a fag, kid! Once me and my friend|Zvonce fell out and agreed to settle things|in a civilised way... Give us a fag! ...with fists,|just the two of us! Robber!|Knight, my arse! When l get there l see two|parked cars and say to myself:.. Shvaba, have I reached|hundred and fifty yet? Even more! l say to myself: Well done,|but that's impossible. sounds exciting. Hey kids, wouId you|give Lydia one? I heard that!|-Quiet, in there. of course not,|she's DiaboIa's Mum. Why d'you fantasise about|her when you wank, then? That's not the same,|is it, uncIe Kure? WeII, Iads, that's a|phiIosophicaI question. Bring that kid aIong,|I want to meet him. You go on, he is asIeep! oh, no, not that camoufIage|business again. Don't go, Kure,|it's dangerous! What's wrong with you,|I'm onIy going hunting... for bunny rabbits! Be brave... Heroes, let's finish them off. They won't surrender. show them all your|strength and power, as you did all along. Be brave, they're|definitely broken! Get up, you Iazy sods! I'm bIeeding whiIe|you're sIeeping! I'II draft you aII!|You Iazy bastards! Everybody down in|five minutes! Inspection! Fitness training|for the body. And the spirit! Kure! Ugh, bIood! It's not mine, it's|from the bunny rabbit. A souvenir for you...|Shvaba, come here! What d'you want? -You said|there'd be an inspection. Get the fuck out of here. Shvaba, take this in. Kure, where's my microwave?|-Give us a Iist next time! Neighbour, how was|the weekend? Was there any fighting? Everything for mother|Serbia, everything! My universities: M. Gorki|G. Pinki (G = Giza) Come on.|Put your head here. Don't breathe. Can you here anything?|-Yes, I can, uncIe Kure. What can you hear?|You can hear my arse! Listen. It's on and|you can't hear it. Kure's bought a BMW, folks. GoIden hands!|Give us that! Not that... I'II make|a man out of you yet. It's a miracIe what a man|can do with his ten fingers! And remember, every skiII is|worth its weight in goId! How could l explain to him, that me and shvaba were|already learning our trade? Shitting yourseIves, eh?|Watch this, you pussies! Like in|''The BattIe of Neretva''. When the Chetniks rode|into battIe and those partisan cunts|hid behind the gravestones! There goes SIy.|-UncIe Kure... Come here. Have you ever|seen ''The BattIe of Neretva''? You arsehoIes|haven't got a cIue! D'you think I couId|shoot a bit? What did your Mum say, when|am I gonna be on the show? She said that Rat, Pepper|and Bones are on first. of course, if they survive|that Iong. -of course. And me? When's my turn? Go on, spit it out!|-WeII... She says... you're not|in the same cIass. That's what she says, is it? Have you seen|''The Godfather''? You haven't got a cIue! Go home! Rat, Pepper... So you think that's funny? Do you, you cunts? That's not very|nice, is it? You're my friends,|your Iaughter hurts me. I've decided to share|the pain with you. Shvaba... Lets pIay... ''steeI fists''. D'you want it now or straight|away? -Straight away. Who's a hard nut then?|''Enter the Dragon'', eh? Want some more?|-Yes. You do, do you? Come on, then.|-No probs, uncIe Kure. Is that enough for you,|peasant? Not yet!|-Not yet! Hang on, there's no hurry. Right, now... off you go. Come on, Shvaba. That's right, you're|reaIIy hard, Shvaba. A beating can be|a good thing, foks. lt is a good way of checking|if you're a man or a pussy. The problem is that|most people find out they're a pussy. You want be seeing|that bastard any more! Do you wanna be a criminaI? Stojan, you've Iost count!|-No, I'm counting to myseIf. That's fifty, Stojan! Kevin Keegan! Kevin Keegan!|Kevin Keegan! That was the end of wanking,|real life had begun. Kevin, d'you want a Iick? Kure, how many more of these|morons do I have to do for hundred marks. I didn't|know it'd be such hard work. Let the kid enjoy himseIf|and stop taIking crap. How did I do it, uncIe Kure?|-Very good, peasant. Shagging's an art.|Go on, give it a wash. Get a move on, kid. What's up with you, you cunt,|shitting yourseIf, eh? Thank God for that.|Next! WeII done, Iad. What are you staring at?|Go for it! Come on, kid,|you're the Iast one. Have you faIIen in Iove? Come cIoser. What're you doing, eh? Kure, he can't do it! -What|d'you think, he can't do it? Get Iost, geek! UnbeIievabIe! What are we|gonna do about it? Get your pants off! oK, no probIems. Don't worry, Kure'II|sort you out! Be quiet!...|AIternative medicine! Come here.|-Don't, uncIe Kure...! Concentrate, stand up|straight... Shut up! SureIy we won't go to the|doctor's because of this. This isn't America.|ProbIem soIved. Wow, a shish kebab!|Come on, go for it! Kure, the kid's is doing it!|-Give it to her, Iad. Go on, cunt! Sing!|-Kevin Keegan! l'd be lying to you if|l didn't tell you that at one moment l felt|sorry for diabola. But that was just for|a short, fleeting moment. As Kure says, you're either|fucking or being fucked, there's nothing in-between. A rebeIIion of mice, foIk.|This isn't our war. Did you watch the Iatest|''The Beat of the Street''? LittIe Lemon sIagged us off. Kids are getting|nasty these days. I'm sorry that Kure never|made it on the show. He was reaIIy into the idea. Who gives a fuck|about him, the cunt. Get the fuck out|of the way, bIoody mice! If onIy the sanctions wouId|Iast a bit Ionger, we'd be made. Look at that beauty, eh? What's going on here? Look at Peppers's Merc.|-500 E, hand made. -Shut it! Did you watch the Iatest|''The Beat of the Street''? Wasn't Bones fuII of shit? Pepper, mate, this is|a highway robbery! What're you doing?! You're a fast one, kid.|-Give me that gun! Haven't I toId you before not to interrupt me|whiIe I'm taIking! Sorry, Pepper. -Let's caII|Bones and have some fun. What the fuck are|you pIaying at? D'you know who I am?|-I do. Here's five grand now. Come|and get the rest tomorrow. Why are you fucking with me?|I'm not one of your jerks! Come out and Iets fight for|it Iike in the good oId days!

Here you are,|drink it! What're you pIaying at,|stop it! PIaning a budget is the art|of survivaI in the difficuIt circumstances our|country is facing. Pension, five hundred|and sixty four biIIion, eight hundred and thirty|two miIIion, four hundred and|thirty five thousand, four hundred and seventy|five and a haIf dinars. Write this down:|CounciI tax, one biIIion, TV Iicence, five biIIion, food, not a Iot, but heaIthy,|twenty eight biIIion... Cross out UgIjeshas|eight miIIion. EIectricity, twenty five|biIIion.

Pension, five hundred and|sixty four biIIion... Golden Hand used to bullshit|that '93 was the worst year in the history|of the serbian nation. l couldn't've give a toss|about the nation, folks. For me and shvaba|it was the best year. ln one summer we grew|ten centimetres. Just the right amount,|folks! dope, folks! An expanding|market economy. lt was a great year|for this line of work. lnflation at fuck knows|what percent. People lost|everything they had. It's ready, uncIe Kure! Kure, the kid said that|the scag's ready. compared to others,|Kure was lucky. He only become smack head. Shut up! Use your wiIIpower!|Count to twenty. one, two, three... eight... It's about Ninana.|Thirty five stab wounds. Your first Iove|has gone. Not so fast. Don't Kure, why're|you being Iike that? Pinki, come on. Look at the tits I bought|her, two grand each. Suzy, show the kids|the Grand Canyon. Can I go first, Kure? I've got a concert tonight,|how am I gonna sing? oK scum, shoot her up! Sing, Suzy, sing! Thanks, Kure. Look at my Suzy, the first|vein of BeIgrade. And wider. l put a gun in his mouth,|he started mumbling... How can you be bothered? l told him, you should see|a speech therapist, mate. Sing! ''For the Serbian forces,|that was the onIy way...'' Bravo! See you, peasants! Let's go. Don't.|-Look at the state of him! Look at him! ln serbia, in this trade,|you graduate by shooting your teacher. We didn't have|a hope in hell of graduating. Kure was making sure of that. Mr. Pinki,|how's schooI going? Suck my dick, you oId fart. slowly we've been taking|over the whole neighborhood. Nevenka, come and|watch the news! lt took my stupid dad|ten years to make it from a first sergeant|to a sergeant mayor. And look at me, folks,|then judge who got it right! So you're moving|to SIovenia, eh? No, to the posh|part of town. Give us a ring sometime. We've got a job for you.|-oK -See you. Darko, Iet's get out of here.|Get that Iorry moving. What are you offering|that pratt a job for, he'II have|the pigs onto us! Who's there? The big bad woIf and the|LittIe Red Riding Hood! Where've you been 'tiII now?|-At schooI, on detention. Gran, give us something|to scoff! Get Iost!|-Don't pick on Madonna. Our base was at shvaba's, he|lived alone with his Granny. lf you don't count the hens. In '41 in the middIe of the|night, Ustashas came into Crnici and cut the throats|of about two hundred peopIe. The murdering bustards! Somehow I managed to escape,|got to the river, jumped into the water,|Iooked and sow... What did you see, Granny? Kids have you got|a cigarette for Granny? Here you are, Granny,|an American one. AngIo-American? WeII, Granny, where were we?|-oh, yes, Ustashas! TeII us, Granny, did they|cut your throat or not? I saw them running after me. Somehow I managed|to swim across the Rzava. Shit, what a name - Rzava!|-Rzava, I aImost drowned. Where's that,|is it in DisneyIand? There was a fuII moon, wouId|you fucking beIieve it, everything was Iit up! And Ustashas, with those|big knives in their theets... Wow, Granny,|Iook at that. A Jedi! What a story, Granny! We'II|get you some coke tomorrow. I'd rather have a cock, son. Look at the way they're|pIaying... Like red-Indians! Indians!|Gimme a bear. And you're red-Indians,|too. Brought up on this reservation,|in this condom of a country! And you strike fucking|attitudes. Doing a job, eh? What d'you think you're|doing, you fucking cant! What the fuck d'you want? UncIe Kure, there's a fat|faggot here wants a word with you. Where is he, the pig? Did I get him? of course, uncIe Kure,|you're the bizz! of course I am, you Apache! When I remember...|DusseIdorf, Bundesbank, in the middIe of the day... I just went in, good morning,|three grand better off... Do you know how much is it?|I mean... quantitative? The pigs came,|speciaI branches... I jumped out of the widow,|somersauIted, open fracture,|didn't feeI a thing! What's that?|-A fIy, uncIe Kure. That was business. Not Iike you, drug pushing. In my time that|was dishonourabIe. They knew what honour|was then. Now there's onIy shit Ieft. Pinki, get rid of those|fIies that are pestering uncIe Kure!|Show some respect! Good morning, uncIe Kure.|-Red-Indians! Bogi, Kagny, CIint and UncIe Kure'II aIways|be cowboys for you! At your age, I screwed|a bIack girI in Amsterdam. It's not worth mentioning|the EiffeI Tower.

You'II wake everyone up. When the Serbian peopIe were|going through hard times, Kure feIt their pain|Iike reaI patriotic Serb. Like many of us, he decided|to heIp our peopIe to defend hearth and home, aIong|with our ancestor's graves. Ljubisa Kurcubic Kure,|in a word, a knight in a shining armour,|a true patriot! He was a good man. Handsome.|-And Serb. -Tosser. Not an ordinary man,|a big man! He had a great heart.|-Here's our obituary: ''UncIe Kure, up there from|the HoIIy Iand, you'II see us|with his baIIs in hand''. You're a poet, Pinki.|Who d'you think did it? The one who wrote|the Iongest obituary... or the one who's|making the speech. Good bIess him. ''BIack Raven''. Hey, Ljubisa, BIack Raven, you've found a home forever. We're Iate! You're|in deep shit now! Get a move on, pratts! Look, the coffin's gone! Excuse me, I'm from the TV,|we're Iate. WouId it be a probIem|to dig him up again, so I can fiIm it. -Look|it's her from the teIIy! Pepper, so you're stiII|aIive then! oh, it's you, Liki,|you scam bag! Fuck yourseIf!|My condoIences. I'm reaIIy sorry he didn't|make it onto my show. Another time. Wreath, cIose up on the cross,|and make your own way home. You've reaIIy grown,|now you're reaI young man. Did you ask her?|-Ask what? Which one of us was|the better fuck? -Yes I did. She said we were very|different. -That's no answer. I agree... But I won't|be abIe to ask her again. The Iast round, Kure! I'II find that cunt! You'II kiII the bastard. Thanks, uncIe Pepper.|-See you. Come on, you junkie scum! D'you know why they|caIIed him crazy Kure? They say that when he was on|''The Beat of the Street'' he grabbed one of Lydia's|tits! -Kure was never on ''The Beat of the Street''.|Get Iost! Come on, scumbag.|Look at the state of you. I'II take to the raiIway|station and Iet aII the|deadbeats screw you. or I'II screw you with|an eIectric saw. HeIIo, uncIe Pepper.|-HeIIo. Who are they?|-Kures's kids. AII these new kids|are the same? AwfuI! Shvaba, are you mad|or what? Come on! Is he different?|-What's the fuck with you?! Is he different?|-What do you care? I've got rid of aII the geer. You're not the same,|reaIIy you're not. Am I the same? -Look at|Shvaba, producing eggs. Am I the same?! Why don't you have more|faith in yourseIf? You can't come if you|don't respect yourseIf. You'II end up with|an inferiority compIex. Go and keep Gran|company for a bit. Let's ask Granny if she|thinks you're the same. Gran! Gran, this here is a naturaI|remedy for bIocked sinuses. Is it that ''UncIe Joe's''|cure''? No, I got it straight|from JaiIbird himseIf. It feeIs good, eh Granny?|Sweet marjoram. l looked at shvabas Gran. she looked really sweet|at that moment. And then l thought of|another old woman, some shit from the school. That famous murder of an oId|Iady, and her kiIIer, RaskoInikov, entered|the history books in the way the American fiIm|never wiII. Dostoyevsky... For two months, leper face|talked bollocks about some fella who did some granny in.|And then he apparently wondered if he should've|done it in the first place. Man, a whole book about|doing some old woman in! What if he'd bumped off|some great-looking chick? Would they fuck've put|that on the curriculum! Then the first time l killed|someone came into my mind... There was no should l,|shouldn't l, l just went for it.|But l didn't feel the need to write a book about it.|Me and writing... What a strange smell a gun has|when you kill someone with it, or am l imagining things... Here l go again, telling|the story from the end... instead of how it|all started.

Go on, tell me. Your guests kill for money|or revenge. l don't see the... Attraction, eh?|What about Ninana? Stabbed, 35 times, Mum.|You can't tell me that was for revenge.|-You're a real daftie.
