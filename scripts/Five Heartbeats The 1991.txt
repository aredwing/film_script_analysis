That was contestant number eight, Baby Doll and the Crystals. Good show. jackie, have you seen Eddie? No, but I know he'll be here. Let's continue with the show. Contestant number nine are from Columbus, Ohio, and they're going places. After the show, they're going across the street for a fried gizzard sandwich. Lots of hot sauce. Contestant number nine... Flash and the Ebony Sparks. Let's hear it for them. (Singing) What's wrong? What's wrong? Nothing. All right, y'all up next. Good luck. Right. Choirboy, would you sit down someplace? Damn, you're starting to make me nervous. Relax. How can I relax when... Who's going to sing lead? Bobby's not here. He hasn't called. He missed all the rehearsals this week. We're on next. Eddie's not here. I said I'm gonna talk to them when they get here, all right? I don't like singing in these nasty bars. You're just nervous because last time we was here, you got hit in the head with that bottle. Dresser. They could've booed or something. They didn't have to hit me upside my head with no bottle. Start calling me little peanut-head church boy. All them names and stuff. Nobody's forcing you. Where the hell is Bobby? I fold. I'll raise you 1 0. Too rich for my blood. Easy, Eddie. I think you guys have been cheating. I'm sorry. (Continues) (Continues) Eddie! I'm going to kill you, Eddie! Aah! My fuckin' leg! Get up! I'll get you! Nobody's ever cheated me! (Continues) Stop it! I don't understand you. You say you love me, but you never call. Then you bring me up here and try to screw me in a closet like I'm a whore or something. Stop it right there. I brought you here because I thought you were a woman, not some little girl afraid of life. I'm not looking for some cheap thrill or some stolen moment. I want to take you to another level, living out the chapter from the most romantic novel. I want you and I to walk to the edge of erotica. (Unzips Zipper) (Continues) Whoa! Get out of the way, you stupid son of a bitch! Hold it, Bobby! You're not going nowhere! Oh, God! Shit! My other leg! (Gunshots) Hey. (Singing) Duck, listen to me, man. Bobby ain't here. You're gonna have to sing his part. Eddie ain't here either, but we don't need him. Bobby's not here? Why does he keep doing this shit? He knows I wrote all the music in fve-part harmony. Yeah, I know. Don't worry about it. Go get your brother. Oh... oh... Oh! Oh! Oh! (Continues) (Ends) All right! All right! Our fnal act tonight have been singing together since high school. Ladies and gentlemen, the Five Heartbeats. Let's hear it for them. Hey, man! (Singing) Where's Bobby? Let's go for it. (Continues) Take it,J.T. Take it. (Continues) Dresser, take the bass line. Bass. Bass. (Continues) Choirboy, go to church. Go to church! Go to church! (Continues) (Ends) That's... That's our cousins. Our cousins. Our cousins, our cousins. One more time for the Five Heartbeats. Come on, give it up. Whoo! Let me get all the contestants up. Come on up. We have a winner. We have a winner. We have a winner. "Flash and the Ebony Sparks"! Yeah! My brother would like to meet you. Why doesn't he come over? Because he's shy. Look at his face. Don't he look shy? Yeah, but who's that girl he's sitting with? That's our sister. See? Look how shy he is. So can I get your phone number so he can call you sometime? OK. 5 5 5... Excuse me. I don't mean to disturb anybody, but my name is Jimmy Potter. I just want to say I really enjoyed the show tonight. I especially liked that opening. Shy brother works every time. You looked like you were running for your life. I don't quite know where to begin this, but I was wondering if you fellas could use a good manager. See, I've managed a lot of groups. I think you guys have what it takes to go all the way to the top. Now, you don't have to sign anything. Your word and your handshake are good enough for me. If you give me just one month, I guarantee when you come back, you'll win that talent contest. Yeah? And if you don't win, I'll give you the $1 00. Man, I like them odds. Well, then, you just think about it. And if you're ready, I mean really ready, you be at my house tomorrow night at 7:00, all right? Mr. Potter, Eddie's supposed to be here. I don't know where he at. Stop apologizing for him, Dresser. Sit down. Call meJimmy. Yes, sir. Ladies, next week, we will work on posture and also each individual makeup base, OK? I promise you, next week is going to be more fun. Okeydoke. Bye-bye. Hi. Hi. Come on, Tanya. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Mr. Potter. Bye, Tanya. jimmy, may I see you for a second, please? jimmy, why are you doing this to yourself again? Eleanor, I know what I'm doing, OK? (Horn Honks) Tanya. (Singing) (Ends) What's wrong? What's wrong? You know what's wrong. I thought we agreed that you would not do this. I have such a good feeling about these kids. Aw, Jimmy, you had such a good feeling about the Brownsville Boys. You had a great feeling about the Four Clovers. Great feeling about the Esquires. And when they made it big, what happened? What happened? They left you. They left us. They almost destroyed you. They almost destroyed our marriage. I'm not going to let that happen again. All that other stuff is behind us. All I'm asking is for you to believe in me, just one last time. This group coming up now... you've seen them before. The Five Heartbeats! Come on. Let's hear it for them! 80... and $1 00. That ain't right, taking Mr. Potter's money. Give it back. Nah. Nah. A deal's a deal, Dresser. This is business. jimmy, I told you this was going to happen. Let's get out of here. Good show, fellas. Good show. I got some good news. The owner of the club wants to sign you to a contract. Contract? The owner? Yeah. I don't know. I think you might have to take that up with our new manager. Yeah, that's right. We'll be talking to you, man. All right. Oh, Jimmy. Baby Doll. Baby Doll! Hi. Hey. It's happening, babe. It's really happening. Winning! Hey, how you doing? Where you been... coming back here this late? I told you he had a show tonight. How'd it go? Good. He ain't gonna be shit neither. He didn't say nothin'. He ain't gotta say nothin'. You ain't gonna be shit, 'cause I ain't shit. Hmm? Why you talk like that? You act like you don't even care for the boy. Stella... I care about that boy. I just want him to be a better man than me. All right. Let me have everybody in here. Come on, Heartbeats, let's go. Gentlemen, I got somebody I want you to meet. Sergeant ErnestJohnson... one of my oldest and fnest buddies from the army. He's here to help us with the choreography. What are you talking about, Jim? I do the choreography, man. Dresser, he's not here to take your place. He's here to just help out. What can he teach me? (Belch) If you didn't like what I was doing, you could've come and talk to me instead of going behind my back, bringing in some old drunk. Stop right there! Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't get you out of. Anyway, let me see your best combination. Huh? Huh, my ass. Let me see your best combination. Show him, Dresser. Show him your stuff. Ha ha ha. All right, all right. Cat, Daddy. Ha ha ha. just as I thought. That ain't shit. Hold my cane. Hold my cane. Now pay attention, and you might learn something. Damn. (Sarge) All right, Girl Scouts, let me see you move. Smooth hands. That's what I want to see. All right. Smooth. Yeah! Damn. We're not going to win that talent contest with lazy legs. OK. And turn! All right. Let's move. Pretty hands, now... everything! Them chumps can't beat us, boss. That's not the question. Tonight could be our big break. I don't want to chance it. We don't have nothing to worry about. My cousin loves us, and tonight he's the M.C. Yeah, that's right. So you talk to your cousin. Cookie, I want you to bring some of your girlfriends tonight. You know what to do. Cool. This is amateur night. We now continue our show, and the next group is a very, very exciting group. Bird and the Midnight Falcons. Please. (Singing) - Bird! - Bird! Listen, we got nothing to worry about. The group that's on now... they're good, but they don't stand a chance with us. That's what I want to hear. Fellas, you guys are on next, and, uh, we have one new house policy. The house piano player plays for all the groups. We didn't rehearse with anybody. He doesn't know the song. Duck, I'll take care of it. Now, come here, buddy. Our piano player is going to play. Let me talk to the manager, because my boys have worked long and hard for this. They've come too far to get hit by some house rule... Get off my back! I didn't make the house rules! We can either deal with this or walk. Man, we couldn't prove nothing by walking. This ain't fair. (Continues) (Continues) (Ends) Bird and the Midnight Falcons. Now, folks, this next group coming on told me they are better than Bird and the Midnight Falcons and the Temptations all put together. - Boo! - Boo! I know. I know. I know. But we shall see. Ladies and gentlemen, a nice round of applause for... the Five Heartbeats. - Boo! - Boo! - Boo! - Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! (Singing) Pick it up. He ain't nobody! (Pianist Plays Sour Notes) Go home! (Continues) All right, step aside. Nobody's allowed onstage during a performance. You get out of my way. Are you deaf or just dumb? You heard the man. Hold my cane. Step outside. I'll kick both of you's ass like you stole somethin'. Now, come on, Sarge. It ain't worth it. Come on, Duck. Do the steps with me. No,J.T. It's my music. It's my music. - Boo! - Boo! (Pianist Plays Sour Notes) (Continues) Get down! Come on, Eddie! Sing the song, boy! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Duck, y'all, let's do it like we did in the tunnel.

He's kind of cute. I'm kind of having a bad time tonight 'cause I have to baby-sit him. He can't dance, don't know how to talk to women. He's a virgin. Look at that dumb little look on his face. Now that you mention it, he does look stupid. So why don't we get out of here? Let's go do something. Anything. You reading my mind, baby. Work it,J.T. Work it! (Singing) Thanks. (Continues) j.T.? I tricked you. (Ends) I got to fght every night to prove my love! What you doing with my woman? I'm not doing nothing! (Yelling) (Singing) I'm starting to get it. Duck, I'm trying to clean up this room. I'm trying to write a song. All right, but if this room isn't clean by the time Mama and Daddy get home, somebody's going to be in big trouble. If this song isn't written by Saturday, I'm going to be in trouble. You know, I don't see what's so hard. All you got to do is combine this part with this part. (Singing) Shh. Shh. (Continues) (Both Continue) (Both Continue) Chorus. Dance break! (Continues) (Ends) I want to sign you guys. Huh? I mean, I love this record. I mean, it is hot. l-l-It's the sound. You know, the sound. It... ohh, you guys are geniuses. You're brilliant. But I got one little problem. l... I don't think this song is right for this group, but I got a group I think would be perfect for this song. Hold on a second. Marsha, send in the Five Horsemen. You're going to love these guys.

That's good. Yeah, all right, publishing, yeah. Well, we can talk about it. And this number of options. You know the business, Jimmy. I'm sure your contract with these boys is for a long time. I trust my boys. What's a fair number of options for you? I'd say six one-year options. Sounds good to me. I'll have Sheila change it right away. Any other changes your lawyer would make would probably be minor, so do we have a deal, Jimmy? Come on. We have a deal. All right. Yeah! Yeah! (Singing) Gentlemen! (Continues) Come on, guys, smile. I love it. I love it. (Ends) Yes? Can I help you? Uh, yeah. I'm Duck. Duck? Uh... I'm the one that's been writing you the poetry. "We Haven't Finished Yet." Um... I think your poetry is really, really nice, but I don't think it's a good idea for you to come here anymore. Why? Oh, you're here. I'll be right with you. Excuse me? Ah, here you go. No. It's 7 a.m. Get up.! This is wild, wild, pretty Rudy on your favorite radio station playing thejam to get you to yourJ-O-B, brought to you by Benny Mullin's Barber Shop. Go get pretty like me. Whoo.! My hair's fried, dyed, and laid to the side. This week's special, theJohnny Mathis look. 8.85. Also with the special, two free fiish sandwiches from Shanea. She's sorry the fiish was bad last week. Some of you got sick, but, still, nobody knows fiish like Shanea. Coming up, the Dells, the Four Tops, but fiirst, a group with a hot single. The Five Heartbeats singing I Got Nothing but Love. (Singing) Duck, shut up, man. Stop trying to sing everybody's part. I'm not trying to sing everybody's part. That's on the radio. (Continues) Our song's on the radio. Duck! Duck! Our song's on the radio! - Aaah! - Aha aah! Aaah! What the hell is going on in here? Our song. Our song. What's wrong? What's wrong? Our song's on the radio, Mama. Aah! (Ends) (Applause) Make me proud of you, OK? Yes, ma'am. I'm going to say goodbye now 'cause I can't watch you leave. Well, you know your mother, how emotional she gets. Now, listen, there's going to be a lot of young gals on that road. I want you to put a helmet on that soldier. What? You know, put a tent on that tree. Put a hat on your willy. - Oh. Oh. Use a rubber. - Oh, a rubber. OK, OK, I'll see you. Take care. Bye, Daddy. How can I preach the Word of God and expect them to listen and my son disobeys me? How does that look? Dad, God gave me this voice in the frst place. Myra, you know this is wrong. Anthony, you disappoint me. You can't serve two masters. Go on. Anthony. Anthony. It's your life. You've got to experience different things. Now, take this. And I want a gold record, you hear that? You better bring me that gold record. Thanks, Mom. Come on. We should make a left turn here. No, Sarge, it's a right turn, then we'll see the Harlem Duke. The Harlem Duke. Fellas, I like that name. Man, we on our way. Ladies and gentlemen, the Four... Five Heartbeats. (Singing) (Ends) We pray together. It's just like a family, Dad. Why don't you believe me, Dad? That's what you think I am? That's what I'm going to be, OK? OK? j.T., you get lucky with women, man. That's what it is. Not lucky. I'm successful. The reason I'm successful is I will do anything to get it. I play like I'm showing them my real feelings. Women love men like that. I break down and cry at the drop of a hat. They go for it every time. And if she tells somebody I cried for her, I just deny it. (Siren) Look at me. Think I have to cry to get some? Shit. Duck, what did you do? I didn't do nothing. Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. Hands, let me see them. All right, everybody get out of the car. How do I know y'all a singing group? Why don't y'all... sing something? (Singing) (Ends) (Singing) (Ends) You see Phil? See him anywhere? Oh, here he come. All right. Hey, Phil, man! Hey, look at you, boy. You guys look great. New suit? Feels good to be out of the city. Nice bus ride's just what I needed. Record's doing real well on the charts. We're just about to release the second cut. Big Red sends his best. Yeah, but did he send the paychecks? Got them right here. Tell Red we need some more money. I'm tired of staying in these sleazy hotels. Toilets don't even work. You got the reports on the record sales? Got them right here. What about the album cover? Yeah, the album cover. Yeah, I got it. Well, let's see it. Now, frst of all, Big Red really believes in you guys, and we decided to change the cover a little bit because we see the big picture... Negroes and white folks buying this album. I like that idea. Let me explain, OK? Everybody's going to know who this group is. We just felt that the picture wasn't as important as it was that we succeed in crossing over. I want my boys' picture back on this album cover! It's too late. We'll see about that. A lot of bull. Why do we have to cross over? Why are niggers always crossing over something, huh? What's the matter? They can accept our music as long as they can't see our faces? Take it easy on the dude. It's Big Red's idea. It's a good one, too. First we build a strong crossover audience, then we can come out strong. That's bullshit, and you know it. Crossover's nothing but a double-cross. Once we lose our audience, we'll never get them back. Next thing you know, they try to change our sound. They'll have us sounding like white boys. White boys sound like niggers, they're the ones making all the money. Tell me something, how come they never cross over to us? I never seen fve niggers on Elvis Presley's album cover. Let's keep our tempers here. Now, come on. This isn't a racial issue. We all have to look at the big picture. Man, fuck the big picture if they can't accept us for who we are and what we look like. Come on. What are you doing, man? What are you doing? What... What you doing in the hallway? Hmm. Choirboy got a girl in the room. Choirboy's got a girl in the room? Mm-hmm. Choirboy. Dresser, where you going? Uh, I'm going out for a walk. What's up, man? You OK? You been acting strange ever since we left Cleveland. I got some things on my mind, you know. What things? She's pregnant. I don't know what to do. I love Brenda more than anything in the world. You know that, but... how am I going to raise a kid on what we make here? I got to get a job, so I talked toJim about leaving the group. "Don't worry. Call Big Red." He... He gave me the number to this, um... this doctor who's... hmm... Didn't you just get through saying you love her more than anything in the world? Yeah. Oh, fellas, come on, I can't. (Applause) (Singing) I'm tired of you wearing my clothes,J.T., tired of you using my toothbrush. And no more sleeping in the hallway either. And I'm tired of you going in my suitcase. You wear my clothes, too, Duck. - I ask frst. - Shh! Shut up and sing and stop acting like a bitch. Oh, I'm acting like a bitch now? Yes, you are. (Continues) What the hell you doing? Hey! Quit clowning around. (Ends) Yeah, I just got to teach them how to... use everything they do. I wish you luck. Yeah. Everything, onstage and off. It'll be all right. Don't worry. The Heartbeats. Let's go check them out. (Singing) I'm sick of your shit, Duck! You ripped my jacket. What's wrong with you? I'm sick of your shit,J.T.! If you're not going to do it right, don't do it at all! Duck's right now, man. If we ain't going to do it right, let's not do it at all. Break down! (Continues) (Ends) What color you want? (Singing) (Continues) Open your eyes. A new house! (Ends) Baby, I don't need no ashtray. The whole world's an ashtray if I had that kind. Here we go again with the number one hit in the country by the Five Heartbeats. These boys are pretty, pretty, pretty because they've been to Benny, Benny, Benny, and they're number one, one, one. Have you gone to Benny Mullin's to get into the beauty contest? What do you think I am, Eddie... stupid? I know who Monroe is and what he does. Hey, you ain't got your woman in check, man? Uh... baby, I think you're overstepping your bounds just a little bit, you know? I can't do this anymore. I can't sit back and watch you destroy yourself. Come on, baby, not in here, please. I just wanted to let you know that... I packed my things, and... I'll be gone. It's showtime.! Opening Big Red's Soul Revue... Bird and the Midnight Falcons.! (Singing) (Ends) You're doing a great job with the Heartbeats. You're late again, Eddie. I know what you been trying to do, but you ain't going to do it. See, Big Red done pulled my coattail to you a long, long time ago. That's bullshit, Eddie. You're talking crazy, man. Yeah, I'm crazy like a motherfucking fox. And you... I can see through your jive ass like glass, nigger. Eddie, you got it all wrong. Stealing my moves, my style. You're even trying to riff like me! Why don't you get your boy out of here and detox him? You want my spot, Flash? Hmm? Slum-dwelling, scum-sucking, slug-ass motherfucker! You want my spot, Flash? Huh? Well, you ain't going to get it, 'cause you ain't got it. (Singing) (Ends) No word on Eddie? I can sing his parts. I know all his parts. OK, go ahead. Thank you. Eddie. Eddie, get up! Eddie, get up, damn it! Eddie, get up! And what is this shit? No, no. I did what I did tonight, man, on purpose. jimmy, man, he's on some kind of motherfucking power trip and shit, talking about replacing people. I just wanted to show that motherfucker what time it was! You left us hanging because of shit between you and Jimmy? jimmy, man, he don't know, man. He just think he know, but... That ain't got nothing to do with what we're talking about, man! We talked about this drinking and drug shit before. You said you was going to quit, so we left you alone, thinking you would calm down. just 'cause I have one... two, maybe two drinks sometime... What, I'm an alcoholic now? What happened to Baby Doll? You're worse than your old man. I'll kick your motherfucking... Get off him, Eddie! What you doin', man? Thank you, but you didn't have to. I could have chased him to the other side of the room. Oh, no. You'd have never caught him. You enjoying the party? I'm here with my girlfriend Janet. Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm the lead singer in the Five Heartbeats. I put the shit together, and I write most of the material. I didn't know it was you. Would you please excuse me? What's your name? Sandra Tillman. Hi. Anthony Stone. They call me Rock. Rock? We changing our style. We getting Afros. We're going to be recording on our own record label. Now, you heard of Berry Gordy and Motown. Leon and Lester... - 'Fro town! - 'Fro town! Excuse me. Mr. Duck? Tanya Sawyer. You remember me. Yeah. So, have you written any poems lately? Um... No. I've, um... Um... You want to get out of here and go somewhere and talk? Yeah. Let me tell my brother. He's upstairs, and, uh... just wait right here. No. See, I got a better one. How you keep an asshole in suspense? Oh, you can talk now. Hey, how's it going? You're not leaving the party, are you? No. I'm going toJ.T. 's room. Listen to this one. There was this king and he had three daughters. He told the princes of the land that if you wanted my daughters... I need to talk to you, Big Red. Give me a minute. Can't you see I'm talking? No! I need to talk to you right now about my royalties and how you keep your books. My offce hours are from 9:00 to 5:00. Fuck your offce hours! I need to talk to you right now, motherfucker! Look at that! What are you doing, man? Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me. You don't talk back! Uhh! Aah! Huh? Aah! Open up the goddamn window! No! Yeah!

Bring him up. Come on, boy. Bring him in. Come back here! Let me up! Now, if you have any other problems with your royalties and my books... my offce hours are from... my offce hours are from... 9:00 to 5:00. You know, something's wrong. You're sitting by yourself, there's a big party going on upstairs for us. All the ladies are asking about you. They don't care nothing about me. They just want to be seen with J.T. of the Heartbeats. j.T., that's always been part of your rap. "Hello. I'm J.T. of the Five Heartbeats. How ya doin'?" Yeah, I know, I know, but I'm tired of that. I'm getting older, Duck. I don't want to be some old man still chasing. I'm tired of being with different women every night. It's like it's a drug, and I don't get nothing out of it. Settle down, have some little kids running around the house... No. I can't do that. It's like I don't know what it is. I like being with different women all the time. It's like I can't control myself. It's like I'm addicted. I don't know what to say. I mean, they got centers for drug addicts and alcoholics, but I don't know if they have any dick-control centers. I'm serious, Duck. I'm serious too. You should go to a dick-control center. "I'm J.T. Matthews, and I can't control my dick." Oh, man. What they going to do to it, though? You just work with some mannequins. j.T., it's like this, man... When the right woman comes along, it's going to be right. You can't force it. Yeah. I know. You're right. This would make a great song. Yeah, yeah. When you have one of those crumb snatchers, just name one after me, OK? Whoever gets married frst. I'll see you upstairs. jimmy! Man, what's so important it couldn't wait until tomorrow? Eleanor's mad as hell. We had plans today. This ain't going to take that long. Ha ha ha ha! Well... Hey, Eddie! jimmy. I wanted to talk to you, because I think it's time for some changes. You've done a great job with the boys, but now I think it's time for the boys to have a more experienced manager. What's the joke, man? It's not a joke. Then what the hell are you talking about? I'm talking about buying you out. Are you out of your fucking mind? No. I have a contract on Eddie. Eddie, what the hell is this all about? jimmy, you know goddamn well what this is all about. Hey, baby... I don't need no manager out there trying to replace me. You ain't out there singing and dancing every night. jimmy, you don't do nothing but get paid. Same old Big Red. You're not taking the Heartbeats from me. Eddie is the Heartbeats. The other guys can be replaced with anybody. You know that. Besides, the other guys can't go anywhere until they've paid me for the cars and clothes. I got an even longer list of expenses... studio time, promotions, your expense account. So, you see, you really owe me, Jimmy. You're trying to muscle me? As a friend, I am trying to put some money into your pockets. Look, I'm not Bird! You can't dangle me out some window and expect me to go away. I'll take your ass to court frst. I'll talk about all the warehouses where you used to press bootleg records of your own artists. Your two sets of accounting books, and a long list of D.J. s taking payola.

An early-morning fiire took the lives of nine people in an apartment building on Jefferson and 2nd Avenue. Eddie King, Jr., ex-lead singer of the Five Heartbeats, was involved in a shootout with police while trying to rob a neighborhood liquor store. He was shot several times and is listed in critical condition. (Thunderclap) I know you. Donald "Duck" Matthews. One of the Five Heartbeats. I got all your albums, been to all your shows. Can I have your autograph? This has been a good night. Two Heartbeats in one night. Yeah, your brother just went upstairs. Could you sign under his? My wife won't believe this. I love your music. Thank... Thank you, thank you. Oh, wow. Wow! Oh. No more messages through Choirboy. If you wanna get in touch with me, you know how to reach me. I'm chasing you and using Duck? You tell me what's going on. I've been after you all these years... Don't act like you don't know! You know what's going on! You tell me what's going on right now! First you were going out with each other. That's fne. But now you're taking this too far. You're talking about marrying my brother. I can't let you hurt my brother. You hear me? I can't. I want you to call Duck, and I want you to tell him this thing's off. You hear me? Why? Because you don't love him, that's why. I know. I been with you. You love me, baby. I love you,J.T. I love you. But I'm in love with Duck. I'm in love with him. There's a difference. If you really love him, you got to tell him the truth. I can't. Thank you. It's a very special moment for all of us. I would like to thank A&B Records for everything that they've done. I hope we can get one of these every time we come out. It's really great. I just want to say I love you, Brenda and Monica. Wow, huh? Heh heh. I really don't know what to say. I just know that I couldn't have done anything without four of the most talented, warm, giving brothers on this entire planet. They're the ones that deserve this applause. These four gentlemen opened their arms and embraced me like I was a brother. That's why today is... special. A very, very happy occasion for me... as well as a sad one. Um... it hurts me to announce that I'm leaving the group. (Gasps) I want to say thanks, fellas, for everything. Uh, and thank you for this gold album, A&B, and I hope we have the same success on my new solo album... Flash... It's Lonely at the Top, which will be in your record stores in about two weeks. Well, God bless all of you and... thank you. (Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. You know, I thought when I got this, I'd feel on top of the world, you know? Today I just feel... uh... I was... I was at a party once, and a, uh... music critic said, "Donald Matthews is going to be a great writer one day when he suffers more." And I said to myself, "What does that mean?" Now I know what it means. I'm on my way to becoming a great writer, and I'd like to thank two people in particular. My fancee... and my brother. My brother... who's always been the same selfsh motherfucker since we were kids. Don't do this here. What you talking about? I hope I get a deal like Flash 'cause today's my last day as a Heartbeat too. Duck, don't do this. Duck! Thank you very much. (Singing) Dear Duck, I know it's been years, and we haven't been in touch. I miss your friendship and laughter. I've invested a good portion of my earnings from the group into my father's church. The fiirst service will be this Sunday. Will you please come? It would mean the world to me if we were blessed with your presence. I love you. I miss you. Together forever, Choirboy. P.S. I have a special surprise for you. How can any man say... that he loves God... whom he cannot see... and not love his brothers who he sees daily? - Amen. - Amen. That's what I want to talk about this morning. All right. - Love. True love. - Yes, Lord. Unconditional love.

Sure y'all want to hang with old Eddie King? We're sure. (Singing) What you waiting on, Duck? I ain't sang in years. (Continues) You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Fall in line, Girl Scout. You don't need me.
