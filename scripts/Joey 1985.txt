As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways... ...and my thoughts than your thoughts. As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. Have mercy on us sinners. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. You shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace. ...Amen. My deepest sympathy. Be brave, my boy. I'm so sorry... Chin up, kid. My, how you've grown. You may not remember. We are Uncle Brad and Aunt Margaret. You're the man of the family now. I can't do it. I simply can't finish the tower. I know exactly how to do it, but without you it's just no fun. I really try to think about what you said. The whole time I try to imagine you are here. But that makes me even sadder. Dad, I miss you so much. That's it Joey, come on, show me what you got. Come on. Yes! That's it! Well done. Again, let's go. Scooter, bring it! Daddy, please come back. Slow down. Stop. When I open my eyes everything will be over. Please. Don't you hear? Stop now, please! Charlie. Daddy? That's not possible! Daddy? That just can't be. Oh, no! Yes, all my toys started going mad. Yes, and Charlie, the robot you gave me last Christmas, makes the funniest sounds now. No, really, it's crazy! But if I can hear you, why can't I see you? I don't understand, I can clearly feel that you are here. Well... there's not much to tell. Oh yeah, Jessica finally left today. It was about time, in two weeks I go back to school. Too bad, but maybe I'll make the basketball team this year. - Daddy, don't leave me again. - Dear God, please help me. Promise? You can't do that. Never again. Please? Daddy... I love you. We were discussing this fellow here yesterday... ...and we have seen that he doesn't lay eggs. Today we examine the ordinary chicken egg. I hope you all brought your own one. A chicken egg is built in a way that it can't be broken lengthwise. Hold it with the small part facing up. Bernie, Bernie, now he has it. This is what your father looks like now. Bobby, if you keep eating like this you'll burst. Joey, what do you have there? Let me see it? This kind of humor is going too far. What if your father had died... But he is not dead, he still calls him. - Who is this nonsense? - That's what the loony said. Now listen closely. Joey loved his father, and surely thinks about him a lot. May he can't believe that he'll never see him again. I don't think it's fair making fun of him. Joey, where's your egg? Did somebody take it? - William, did you take it? - No, I didn't. - Bernie? - Me? No. - Michael? - No, certainly not. I'm waiting for an answer. Who took it from him? C'mon guys respond. Well, whatever you want... Everyone will stay behind after class... Damn it, quiet! A rather macabre joke. Joey is apparently not accepted. He seems to have no friends. I've tried everything with no success. I don't understand. I thought he was all right or I wouldn't have sent him back to school. He misses his father, that's the problem. Yes, I know. There's something else... Children make fun of him because he says he talks to his father on the phone. - The kids say that? - No, Joey says that. Latest news, when last night.. your phone went crazy, don't get upset, your neighbor's did the same. Around 10 pm the phone system of Virginia Beach... ...collapsed for half an hour. Joey. Joey. Charlie wait, he won't do anything. Scooter, stay! What are you doing up there? Dinner's ready. Hey Scooter, leave him alone. He must be in there Hey, Charlie, Don't you hear? Get out. What is that? Joey? Charlie, be quiet already. How could you stand it down there? It's much nicer here than being around this old junk. Scooter. Joey, you have 5 more seconds. - 5 seconds are over. - They are not. By the time you come the food is cold. Don't make that face again. I was watching that. First you eat and then to bed. Drink your milk. - Do that again! - What? What you just did. Give it to me. Now do it again. My god! Who showed you? Who taught you that trick? It's not a trick. Don't tell me. Of course it's a trick. - Do it again. - I don't want to. Please Joey. I want to know. You do it under the table, right? Come on, I want to learn it. - It's really not a trick. - No - Then how do you do it? - I just wish it. You just wish it? Daddy helps me. Daddy? Don't be afraid. - I don't have to be afraid? - I'll get it. Come on. OK, then stay here. You are evil. What do you want? Jonathan Fletcher was the last great ventriloquist. In the thirties... ...he created a new show "Fletcher & Fletcher"... ...which got him world - famous. His partner Fletcher, the famous puppet... ...soon turned into a malicious being. What do you want from me? After his wife and son died in a tragic accident he stopped performing. In the late 40s he showed up again... ...and made a comeback with his old show. In 1954 he died under mysterious circumstances in a fire... Answer me, who are you? Or leave me alone. ...many people doubted the burned remains were Jonathan Fletcher's... because neither traces of the dummy... I don't want to have anything to do with you, do you understand? Mommy! Please don't hurt her, leave her alone. Stop it! Stop it! Mom! What did he do to you? Did he lock you out? Joey, what are you doing. Scare me to death? Joey, what's going on with you? Why isn't the light on? What's the matter with you. You were never afraid before. - I'm not afraid. - Of course not. Were you on the phone again? Joey, something's wrong with you. What happened in the kitchen? Won't you tell me? - I can't. - You can't? It's okay. Everything is okay. We'll talk about it tomorrow, al right? Regarding the latest shutdown of the Virginia Beach phone system... ...experts are still debating the possible cause of this latest interference. Some believe it could be an extraterrestrial phenomenon. Some say that only psychologists of the paranormal may solve this. Subscribers at Virginia Beach are requested to have some more patience... ...and are asked for their understanding... It wasn't me. What do you mean? - What do you mean? - Honest. My God Joey, why do you say such a thing? Would you please tell me what's going on? - Do you promise not to tell anyone? - Of course. He's evil. He want let me to talk to Daddy. Joey, we'll leave in half an hour. How come you weren't in school today? We're going to see my aunt Jessica. That's too bad. Really too bad. He's burying something. Yes, looks like it. Well, they finally leave. Hey Charlie. Charlie where are you? Hey, there you are. Let me introduce you. This is Charlie. Charlie, this is Sally. What's wrong with him? Don't be such a chicken. - Why is he chirping? - He's talking. - Don't make things up. - But it's true Sally. What do we have here? Charlie. Charlie. What are you two doing there? Charlie! No! - Charlie, move out of the way! - Charlie, leave! Get out of the way! You're so mean. Great shot! - Who on earth is throwing bombs? - It wasn't us. It was Joey. How did you get in here? Sorry, the door was open, I heard the radio and... Joey wasn't in school today so I thought I'd stop by. Yes, he had a sore throat this morning so I thought he'd better stay in bed. I just saw him in the garden with some kids. What kids? Oh, what am I doing! Use this. Some kids from his class. - Did you think about my suggestion? - What suggestion? Consulting a child psychologist. Sorry, but let's talk about this some other time. I know that you... What is this? Please leave me and my son alone. We'll manage. Are you really implying that Joey, the boy... can communicate with the dead? For him, his father isn't really dead. - But how does he talk to him? - He just uses a phone. What about the knives? How did that happen? Joey says the dummy did it I know it sounds silly, but... he found it somewhere and brought it home. He says it's evil. It doesn't want him to talk to his father and punishes him for playing the game. Whatever that means I'm not sure what he tried to say. Come on. Wait a minute. - I know I put the dummy down here. - The dummy? - I found it in the garden. Oh man, I'm dead meat! I just borrowed these. My brother is going to kill me. - Why didn't you wait? - It wouldn't have made no difference. One look and pow - they were gone! How am I going to explain to my brother where his tanks are? - Oh, start crying! - You have it easy! Maybe we should kidnap him. Hey, come here, I found something! Not so fast! Wait! Are you scared? - You really want to go in there? - Wait, I have a lighter. - Hey, there's a box of candles. - Give me one. - Look at this. - Wow! I think, that the ceiling is about to cave in. Look, there's an old jukebox. Awesome, check if it it's still working. There's another one! Joey, dinner is ready. I hope it didn't scare you. Tell him to leave it alone. Joey, what kind of behavior is that? Sit down and behave. I was just looking at it. Martin, your plate please. - Hello? Your plate. - Sorry. What about you? My God, did you see that? Don't let it ruin your appetite. Well, Joey... Joey, stop that and start eating. Your mother and I think you should go back to school tomorrow, What do you think? Joey, he asked you something. I'm not going back to school. You don't have to worry about the other kids. I think the best thing would be... ...how should I put it... ...if you keep your secrets to yourself. What Martin and I are trying to say is... ...enough of your tricks, okay? Will you promise me that? - Martin, dinner is getting cold. - Yes. - What happened? - I burned my hand! Joey, what have you done? Come on, let's put it in ice water. - No, no. Here... there. - I'll get some ice. - Are you sure it was Joey? Who else? I once read that such phenomena occur at puberty. Puberty? Joey just turned nine. DO NOT ENTER She didn't keep it to herself... ...yes, and she said she wouldn't tell anyone. Why can't they just leave me alone? No, I don't want to go to school anymore. I hate them. I really hate them. No, he isn't nice, just stupid. He treats me like a baby Really, I can take care of myself. Okay, if you say so... Joey? Where are you? Joey! There's no use hiding. Mommy! Why are you doing this? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, don't go there! Mommy! I know you're here. Laura! Laura, come quick! What is this now? I knew you were here. Where are you? Mommy, I'm here! Laura, watch out! I hate you! I want you to leave! I never want to see you again! You hear? No! What do you want from me? A little game. I won't play with you. We'll see. Daddy! Yes, we'll see. Let me down! Daddy, help me! Daddy, Daddy! Here, here. Help! What is it, Laura? I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Joey! Dad, help me! - Joey! - Stay away from the door! Leave her alone! Mom, be careful! - He has blocked the door. - Joey, please open up! Come on, open the door! Calm down, I'll get help, I promise. Things will be all right. Keep going, keep going... stop! Come on, come on. Keep going... Stop! Hey, watch out! - Do we have to go up there? - To the house. Careful with the lamp, put it here. Watch out! - Sorry, I'm a bit nervous. - Are you okay, Laura? I don't know, I try to save what I can. Look at that, is this for real? - All that for that little idiot? - That's unbelievable. If he thinks he can get away with this, he's wrong. He has to pay his dues. We have to think of something quickly. Hey, wait a minute! Hold it, you can't go in. Joey look around. Everything will be set up here. And the people over there are from the phone company. You've caused them a few sleepless nights lately. Up there are colleagues of mine. They take note of everything when we do the tests. Dr. Hayden. - What's going on here? You must be the boy's teacher. - Looks like the whole city is moving in. - Don't worry. We have experience in these matters. The house is blocked off. Have you noticed any changes in the boy recently? No, I can't think of any. Scooter, get down! - Any illnesses? - Not that I know of. - Oh, yes. A cold. - A cold? A cold. - Are you ready? - Yes. Turtle to Eagle, am at observation post one, start distraction maneuver. It worked. Let's go. I hope it's not too uncomfortable, but it has to be, okay? You will hear a tape with recordings what happened 5 nights ago... ...at 20:45 pm. Understood? You may begin. Playing. Dad Dad, help me Go Dad, help me Help Help, help! Daddy, Daddy! Turtle to Eagle, we are now at observation post two. Hey, what's this? Idiot, I'm not a trash can! Why not yell a little more? Who is this guy? I'm telling you, he's from the CIA. - CIA... This joker? - Careful! The entire phone system was shut down... ...and the center of this interference was this house. Joey, your mother told me you didn't talk to her again. You may not believe me, but I have talked to people with the same gift. Most people do not understand them. They're afraid of them. They find they're different, strange, but they're not really. Their gift is a rare treasure for us all. They are maybe proof that death as we know it doesn't exist. When I walked through the house I noticed something strange. There were no toys to be found anywhere. But your teacher told me great stories about them. What happened? I know about the dangers, but you can master them, if you recognize them. Damn, they're everywhere! - You can't move the stand through there. What are they doing? - Make a report. - Okay. Headquarters, come in. All is quiet. We have reached our advanced watch post and will keep you informed - - over. - What is this? - Some interference in the line. Attention! We're facing an enemy spy... We do not have time for that, let her go. Okay Sally, get lost. We will try to get to the center of the enemy base. We are not making any prisoners. We'll fight to the bitter end. Our single objective is Joey Collins. I demand courage and determination from everyone. Now to our strategy. Spiderman, you're in command of the left flank. Robin and Golden Eagle, you're in command of the right flank. My men and I will go straight through the center. Any questions? Good. - May the force be with us! - May the force be with us! Okay, understood. We were starting to get bored. Hey, look who's coming. Headquarters, Joey's mother's leaving the house. Wait, the jerk of a teacher, too. Laura! - I am so hot! - Stop whining! - Mayday! Mayday! There's Sally! - Hey! Hey, what are you doing there? Attack! Girl, where are you going? Joey, they're trying to capture you! They can be here any minute. Come on, we must hurry. Hey, stay here! Joey, do something. - I can't. - Why not? Get them all! - Please Joey, do something. - Okay, but for the last time. - What's going on here? - Where are they all going? What are they doing? What do we have here? Where are these kids coming from? - Do something. - Watch the equipment. - How do you do it, Joey? - I play the game. Dr. Hayden, look! Attack! Whack him! What is this? Mommy, Mommy! I understand why you ran away, it was just too much. - The boy needs you now, let's go. - Yes. When everything settles down you should take the boy on a short getaway. You both need it. I hope this will all be over over soon, I will see to it. But if his father isn't dead, is he some kind of ghost? When you die, you're not really dead. The soul enters a new world. If I'd say something like this at home, they'd think I'm nuts. - I don't think so. - Sorry, but he lost it. Just wait... I'll beat the crap of you someday. What's going on here? - Tell us - I lost my teddy bear. Joey, we would like to know if you are led by your feelings. Come on, tell us! Do you wish it or is it simply happening? One moment, I'll be right with you. - Tell us, what was it like? - Why is the light always there? - What's your name? - Leave him alone, he doesn't want to talk. - Why don't you try it? - Tell us your name. What are you all doing here? Get out, move, go! Joey, is everything all right? I shouldn't have left you alone. What did they do to you? Asking stupid questions. Should I tell them to leave? Good, I'll be right back. - What is it? - He's gone. We have to warn them. - I'm going home. - Look, this is you. Too bad, we can't tell anybody. Can you imagine what they would pay for a story like this? We all gave our word of honor, so let's keep it. - Mommy, Mommy, we'll keep quiet! - You wait... Knock him down! Get him! We started the jukebox! Watch out! Mommy! Help! Watch out! - Head for the stairs! - Hurry up! Come on, let's get this door open! - The kids need their rest. - They are totally upset. - Maybe there's another staircase. - Are you crazy? I'm not going. Then stay there, fatso. Wait! Watch out, the ceiling caved in. Do you see anything? - So, what do we do now? - I don't know. We split up. You two come with me. - Joey, we can't go in here. - We have to. It's a dead end. We're never ever get out! Wait for me! - William, you won't believe what I saw! - Do you hear that? I told you not to go in, now we're in trouble. Come on, calm down. - Oh, it's you! - Did you find a way out? No, just a big monster with yellow eyes. Come on Sally, we have to find them. If we only knew where we are... - I want to go home! - Let's keep looking. Joey, Joey! Joey! Where are you? My God, Martin, he must be somewhere! Relax, Laura. It probably was too much for him. I'm sure they'll find him. But I promised him I'd get rid of them all. He's not here either. Come over here. - We're now in the forest. - Any sign? - Not yet. - Okay, keep looking. Davis, for you. Anything new? Some more parents say their children did not come home. Try to calm them down, I'll get in touch. Take over, will you? Mrs. Collins, we got news that other children are missing. Let's go on. I can't go no more, we won't ever get out. We'll die of hunger. Shut up. We'll get out! We have to find them! Hey, be quiet. You hear that? - Come on, let's get out of here. - Shut up! Who's there? How did you find us? Where's the way out? There's no way out. Who's got the dummy? Look at that. No, he hasn't got that much power. - Don't you dare disturb him! - I won't listen to you! Please, help us getting out of here. Tell him to leave us alone! Joey, who are you talking to? - Get lost! I told you to get lost! - Shut up! You have to help. Do you hear me? Do you understand me? What are you doing here? Who are you? I've never seen you before. He has trapped us here. Help us TO get out. I will not let you get out of here! That's a promise! I don't need to help you. You have a friend... coming for you. The door, can you see the door? - Go, have no fear. - Joey, don't go! - Hold him back! - Joey, you can't go there! Joey, don't go in! Daddy. Joey, don't go in! Daddy. Joey! Joey! Joey! Where are you? Joey talk to us! They've found the boy. They found the boy. Mrs. Collins, they found him. Joey! Joey, what happened? We need a doctor. Move the barricade, quick! How's the blood pressure? - All ready for the EKG? - Where's the probe? Pulse. Blood pressure? Hurry up! Oxygen. Drip. Start the EKG. Serum. I.V. ready? Do it. Is the I.V. ready? - Okay Bernie, then what happened? - The entire ceiling collapsed... - We tried to run, but couldn't get out. - Why not? We tried everything, there were many doors... and this horrible monster with evil yellow eyes. - And then you saw? - A hamburger... ...never seen such a large one, at least as big as a mountain. - A hamburger? - Maybe a cheeseburger. - Come on, what did you see? - Okay, I saw him. - Who did you see? - Darth Vader. - Will he get well? - Sure he will, Sally. Sally, tell me what you saw. I told him not to go in there. But maybe he didn't want to stay here. Why do you say that? The light was so beautiful. What light are you talking about? As if the sun had come up. Blood pressure 70/20. Atropine, 5mg, let's go! Atropine, 5 mg atropine. How is the pulse? No pulse. Start CPR! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Clear! How is the pulse? No pulse. Come on Joey! You'll make it! Ready? You can do it Joey! You can't give up! One, two, three, four... - Pulse? - No. Damn it, still no pulse. Sorry my little one. Yes, here she comes. For you. What is it? Quiet please. The boy is dead. May we see him? We were very mean to you, but we're really sorry. If you'd still be with us, we would choose you as the new leader. There wouldn't be a better one. I no longer need this. Laura, if you need me... If there's anything I can do... No. I'll take care of Charlie. I promise. You have to go now. So what do we do now? Pack up our things and leave. Leave, don't go in there! I'm not afraid! It's only Joey. Yes! You came back! He is back!
