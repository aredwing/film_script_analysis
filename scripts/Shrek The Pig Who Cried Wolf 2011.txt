Ja?, first it's the poor old lady in the shoe. Well, I thought I saw something. You called the police on that poor woman. And for what? She was forcing those children to make shoes. I saw! They live in a shoe! They were fixing their roof! But do you learn? No! Ja, no! Then you are bothering the children, Jack und Jill. - They looked suspicious! - Ja, ja, ja. So you still don't learn. Next, you are climbing up on the roof to see something. I tell you I see something, und I think it's a UFO! Ja, it was only the cow jumping over the moon. Ja, so why is the dish running away with the spoon? It's like talking to the brick house. Ooh, what is going on over there? When did we get the new neighbor? - Wait! Wait! I thought I saw something! - Nein! No more of this snoopy-spy nonsense. You're going to sit right here und not bother the neighbors. Now you behave, ja? Ja. Nein!. I will behave. This little piggy is all good. Tell me I am not seeing things. I know what I see. Very suspicious. If I have to sit here all night, I will see something. I have the eye of the eagle. I miss nothing. What is that?! Heimlich, are you crazy? There's something going on in that house! See for yourself and then call me crazy. Hi. - Ja, you are crazy. - What? Give me that! - He is a maniac! - Halt! Enough! We are going over there und we will prove, once and for all, to this little piggy there's nothing going on! Ja, und when we return we will make with the "I told you so." Horst! Horst, look out! Look behind you! Oh, Gott! Oh, my stars, another little piggy! What do you want from me? I want you for dinner. Buckle up, buttercup. Why is it always the screaming with you? Oh, are you going to eat this? - What's going on here? - Dinner. Oh, ja. The frulein makes the best everything. But what about... You guys didn't see me doing anything weird, did you? You were acting like the cuckoo without the clock. You buried a box of knives in the ground. You turned into this big fat lady and cooked us food. Yeah, that one. You guys better get out of here. - But everything is so delicious. - Ja. - Ja. - No, trust me. You guys don't wanna be here for... ...my main course, stuffed piggies in a blanket! - I told you I saw something! - Come back! I'm really sorry that... ...you can't stay for dinner! - Wait for me, you swine! - Move faster, Heimi! This is just awkward. Come back! Keep running. Come back! Just keep running.
