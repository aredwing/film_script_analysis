Probably the smartest, he said. It is, as Orwell said. We live in a big machine. All the figures. It does not require torture to put me place. I have no choice. And that is what they want. That one adds up. Think of rats and fearlessness. Do you know what I'm saying? Forget it. See. They built the center so it looks like a place where people are stimulated. But it's not real. Nobody goes on their soulless paths. No one takes care of their dystopian landscape architecture. It's like a cardboard figure of a shopping center. Our world is generated by computers and companies. The imitate real human experiences. Artificial scented candles. Artificial sex appeal. Cultural simulation. Nostalgia. Fictitious memories. Fabricated happiness. Cake, straight from the oven.

You giving me a bag? You should lose weight. You are a little overweight. You stink. And have bad breath. - You think so? - Yes. If you think the spirit is poor, taste my cock, when it's in your ass. My sperm is probably much healthier for you than the bad, you've eaten. Would you like it? Suck on my dick covered with shit? Yes. So if someone gives you a piece of advice be polite and follow it, and say thank you. Thank you. Just press the red button. But be prepared for the consequences. For now I will simply speak. Believe me, I can do much more than that. One day the kid suddenly realize that he does not hate his kone.. ..but his mother. But since he married with her mother, it is too late. Where do you get that stuff? - I collect observations. - Write them down. Write a book. I will do. Let me hear more observations. Okay. Do you see that guy? He thinks hostesses like him. They just give good service. Had a brief affair with the secretary, and it was too weird. He loves his wife, but has not had sex with her for six years. Since they got their youngest son. He has gone out with underwear models since then. It started with catalogs, when his wife made food.. ...and the daughter was practicing on his trumpet. He began to recognize models in various catalogs. He took on various scenarios. Ski Holidays. 10,000-meter team. He recognized the girl on the poster there. He ??saw her in a different catalog. She enjoys being taken back. What about her? She just quit smoking. Yesterday she ate a pint of ice cream. Her child slept for dinner, and the man as "Monster truck" on TV. So she led after the butts in the waste and found one. She sees herself in the mirror every night. She still think that she is sexy. But it seems the man is not. He ??does not understand her appetite. - Sugar get her in a good mood. - Shoot me if I get that. She is thinking about dusting off strangers up and bun at motels. She knows that she will do it. But alcohol problem is cleared. She has not fallen in next dinner party last year. is actually the Steppeulv, I often call me. stray animals, which is not a home or happiness - - in a world that is strange i and incomprehensible to him. The man was the biggest, baddest kid in the neighborhood, in Haiti. He was good at that, so gangsters made him a debt collector. Then he fell in love. He would have a new life, so he moved here. They both work as security guards in an IT company. They worked hard, and every night two o'clock they ate lunch together. But she died. He has an emptiness inside. He ??began to pray to the Madonna for forgiveness. He vowed to make amends by working hard and never hurt anyone again. Every night he goes home to his empty OPPORTUNITY.. ..Eat fiskestuvning and dreams about her Mary. And every night he lies down on his knees and pray. His brain is full of snakes and demons. He looks forward to tomorrow so he can get up and go to work. Wow. Deep. What about this guy? He inherited tuxedo shop from his father 20 years ago. He hates tuxedos almost as much as his life. But he knows the industry. Goes a tuxedo down in value, he sells it to a shop in a poor neighborhood. He knows that most people only goes in tuxedos twice in life. First, the school prom. And when their child gets married. He dominates both markets. He had a meaningless, difficult affair with his accountant. He fucked her the night before her wedding. Good for his ego.
