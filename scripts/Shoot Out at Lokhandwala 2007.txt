Since yesterday you all are watching on our channel.. ..how the Mumbai police had transformed.. ..a residential area into a battlefield. This is not a terrorist's den. Then why 400 policemen had surrounded.. ..this place yesterday? Here ordinary people like you and me stay with their children. Then why more than 3000 rounds were fired here? To kill 6 terrorists, 1 12 citizens' life was put into danger. The police will have to answer all these questions. I am Mita Matu, reporting for TVN.. Mumbai, Lokhandwala. Because of one officer, the entire.. ..police department is distressed. This is shameful, sir! We can't forgive Khan. I mean without justification.. without authorisation.. ..surrounding a residential building.. ..firing without caring for the citizen's life.. ..all this is written in which police manual, sir? We are here to protect.. not to kill. This is the limit, sir! Khan should be punished. And I demand it! Right now he and his officers should be suspended! And there should be an inquiry! Till the time the inquiry is not over, you all are suspended. Now our job lies in your hand. Not job, life! Now all of yours life lies in my hand! Hey! No smoking in this room! So.. sue me! Is this inquiry a game for you, Khan? It was never a game in the first place! It was war! 1984! Operation Blue Star! Blue Star was successful! But violence spread in the whole country! What was your connection with all this? Terrorists escaped from Punjab and.. ..they entered Mumbai's Sikh dominated areas. Bhandup! Charkop! They had learnt of a way to make rich Sikhs shell out money. Quietly give us 20 lakhs! Otherwise we will kill your family members! Gradually their terrorism spread in ordinary Sikhs too. Where was the police? The police would have done something if they had got the report. But one day the police found out. Sub-inspector Abhishekh Matre. My best officer. Hey! What is this? This is Abhishekh Matre speaking. Dahisar, check post. 3 suspects in white gypsy with AK 47. Yes! I am sure it was AK 47! Take him! Shamsher! Your daughter is waiting for you. I have to go! No! Not today! Rohini, try to understand! I am trying to understand, Shamsher! Do you know since when your daughter was waiting for her birthday? So that.. at least for one day you will be with her. I don't have time for all this, Rohini. Yes. You have time for killers and rapists. But not for your family. Abhishekh Matre too had a family. His child became an orphan before being born. You only tell me what should I do? I shouldn't go? I should sit here and eat cake! Mummy! Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Khan. Come. What's the matter, Khan? Is it an important matter that you had to come home on Sunday? Sir, just now I have received the information.. ..that Matre's killers are hiding in Antop Hill. Oh! So shall I issue search and arrest warrant? No search and arrest warrant, sir. I don't want to waste time and papers. I want to directly kill them. So what do you want? TV coverage, sir. A journalist will come with us and cover it live. So that people will watch it. And the terrorists will get the message. That coming to Mumbai will lead to their death. Who will take the camera and face terrorists' bullets? We will find someone, sir. Lipstick. - Is fine. More than the lipstick.. you will need this. Stay away from line of fire. I want your audience to watch each second of the operation. And if a policeman is shot.. do you want us to cover that too? As long as I am there, no policeman will be shot. Just now along with the death of 5 terrorists.. ..the biggest operation in the history of Mumbai police got over. The hero of this operation is ACP Shamsher Khan. What he said, exactly that happened. As long as I am there, no policeman will be shot. I and the citizens of Mumbai are proud that.. ..we have officers like ACP S S. Khan for our protection. I am Mita Matu, from Antop Hill, Mumbai. I think she is your big fan. She is beautiful too. She should have been a star. You provide security to everybody in Bollywood. Tell somebody to make her a heroine. You are right. She has something. Yes. There she is praising you and here you are praising her. You should have had your meals with her. Well! That was sweet! The press and your department are against you. But we are with him. And who the hell are you? Kaviraj Patil. Inspector Kaviraj Patil. Inspector Kaviraj Patil, speak only when you are spoken to. Till then just shut up. Okay. Otherwise very soon you will demoted.. ..to the post of a constable. In which police department do we need such officers? ..I don't understand. The best department of the police! ATS! Yes! Your baby. How did you get this idea? Los Angeles police department. SWAT. Special Weapons and Tactics. To fight modern day terrorism and ordinary criminals. We need such a unit that is efficient, fast and deadly. Deadly! Your speciality. Which fool gave you the licence to kill? Commissioner Krishnamurthy. Didn't I just tell the two of you to shut up? Did I or did I not? No! Did I tell you to shut up or not? So why don't you just shut up! When did you enrol such fools in your circus? From all the police training schools and police stations.. ..in Maharashtra, I selected 27 men. Those who are fit.. who are good shooter.. ..and who can fight criminals. I wanted the best! Oh! That is what you got! I caught a leader from accepting bribe. In return I got the reward.. to check the pockets of all the people. Great! What is great, sir? I am not checking girls. Will you work with me? - Will I get more money? You check people with this iron rod. You don't say anything! I promise you one thing. You will get your rank of inspector back. Let's go. Today you were going to get your result. - Yes. So your mother said to buy something good for you. You like this a lot, don't you? - Yes. You got the report? - Yes. Show it to me. Again so less marks in maths. But papa, I couldn't understand the question. So try.. toil more. When I was of your age, even I couldn't understand. My fellow students became doctors and engineers. And l.. Iive in a small flat. For years I couldn't buy anything for your mother. Before buying this chocolate for you.. ..I had to think 10 times. Is this what you want to become when you grow up? A police officer like me? Son, study. You people have come here too? I have told you before too. I don't want to join your ATS. But why? Nobody has a better network than you in the underworld, Javed. I have given up risking my life for the police. Yes. Of course! Of course! Sir.. he is used to doing safe duty. He stops girls and boys from kissing in the park. Am I right, Mr. Khan? This is the chance to reform your career, Javed! We need you. I don't need it! To get my photo published alongside yours! Hey! Talk with respect! You.. In front of my child, respect me. With Javed's arrival, our ATS was completed. ATS! Assassin Training School! It has been given other names too. - I see! Allah Transport Service. - Oh! 'Aata Tu Sampla' (You are dead). 'Aa Tapkade Shane' (Kill me, smarty). Stop it! ATS means Anti Terrorist Squad. Is that a joke to you? Why? Do you see me laughing? You mean to say.. all the charges against ATS.. ..torture in the lockup, public shootout, encounter killing.. ..all these were false! Come on. Answer me! All this was false? Come on! Answer me! You can't find out the truth and lie on the paper. You know it in the street of Mumbai. Underworld ruled Mumbai. And the boss resided in Dubai. There was an easy way of earning fame.. ..in the underworld. To take somebody's extortion money. This is how Maya grabbed bhai's attention. Maya! How will we do this work amidst so many people? Today we don't even have the silencer. Let's do one thing. Let's cancel today's program. God wills we will kill him tomorrow! Oh no! - Oh no! Bhai, listen! Maya was not afraid of anybody. Not even the police. Scoundrel! If the two of them survived.. tell them.. ..that Maya-bhai escaped two days earlier. During that time Mumbai underworld's.. ..most dangerous shooter was Bhua. Who was it? Look! Her boyfriend has come to save his girlfriend. Will you fight all three of us alone? Let's bash him. - Come on! You! Now nobody will touch you. Bhua belonged to Ashok Joshi's gang. Come on! It settles the account. Now leave! Maya saw him. And he made a plan. It settles the account. That night Ashok Joshi's gang perished in a jiffy. Yeah! - Yeah! His biggest weapon was fear. And Maya became bhai's top general in Mumbai. In her trance. In her trance. In her trance. In her trance. In her trance, I walked. I walked. In her trance. - I walked. In her trance, I walked. I staggered. At times I staggered. And at times I walked straight. At times I staggered. And at times I walked straight. From dawn to dusk. Her name was on my lips. From dawn. From dawn. From dawn to dusk. Her name was on my lips. Like clouds and rains. Like clouds and rains. Like clouds and rains. And rains and clouds. I craved to meet you. I staggered. At times I staggered. And at times I walked straight. At times I staggered. And at times I walked straight. We both had a quarrel. We both had a quarrel. We both had a quarrel. But I couldn't tell her this. We both had a quarrel. But I couldn't tell her this. It was my mistake. It was my punishment. It was my mistake. It was my punishment. I couldn't endure it. Friends, I fought with her. I staggered. I staggered. At times I staggered. And at times I walked straight. At times I staggered. And at times I walked straight. I drank day and night. Drunkards have drunk it. It's not their fault. They drink to their heart's content. I was raised in beer bars. I was raised in beer bars. I staggered. At times I staggered. And at times I walked straight. At times I staggered. And at times I walked straight. I think he was hanged upside down for a long time. He didn't jump. He has been pushed, sir. This is not a suicide, sir. I want to know who has done this! Tell your informers to become alert! Sir! Informers! They are policemen's third ear. In the city's red-light area.. beer bars.. ..in the prison, we have informers. Some work for money. Some to take revenge from somebody. Greetings, sir. Sir, Aslam Kasai thrashed my brother in front of my mother! Hey! Why are you beating him? Sir, he should be killed. Aslam Kasai works for whom? Sir, ask me. I will tell you. He stays in Ghatkopar. What is his gang's leader's name? Tell me! Maya. Maya-bhai. Maya! What is the connection in Sidhwani murder case? Fatso! Shall I hit you! His leg is reeking a lot. Shall we leave him, Phatu? Hold properly. Is his leg reeking or your mouth? You! You have eaten so much, fatso! No, no! Don't leave! He is reeking! Hold him! Hold him! Hold him! Phatu, let's leave him. He is reeking a lot. Hold him properly! Hold him! He is reeking, Phatu! So throw him. Are you joking? Throw him. Bhai said only to scare him. Phatu, what are you saying.. RC, why did you let him go? Why did you leave him? Hey! Our business runs on fear. Only fear. If one builder dies.. hundreds will come to pay. Understand. Come on! Mother, bring bread! - Yes. The food is delicious! - Is that so? You have made such food for the first time! Will you kill us with your food? You won't die, fool! It's good that Sidhwani died. If he doesn't fear us, he will die. What? Have your food. No! I am full. - Eat it! Is it new? It's German. Rapid fire. By the time the police loads one round.. ..all 6 bullets of this gun would have been fired. Bhua.. at dinnertime too! Hey! - Aunt! Aunt, you are looking great! Fire all 6! Aunt, you look great! Wow! Maya, let's make aunt our gang member. She will be better than Phatu! Again the same thing, smarty! As it is Phatu-bhai is not so good! Why are you making me mad! Quietly have your dinner. Always harping about Phatu! We are bound to call Phatu as Phatu! What else to call him? Keep quiet! I got scared just the first time. Tell him. Only the first time? - Yes. Never again. - I won't feel scared again. Is that so? - Yes. Turn back. - Okay! Aunt! Keep the gun down! Keep the gun down! Phatu got scared! Otherwise there will be problem. Bhai, explain to her. Mother. Leave it. He will get a heart attack. Aunt, what do you say? Will you take somebody's extortion money? Will you kill somebody? Tell me. What happened? You got scared. What happened? Whose call was that? From Dubai. For killing Sidhwani. He says henceforth ask before killing somebody! Maya will ask somebody! I told you. Bhai! From so far away.. he orders you people on the phone. And you all fools obey him. Mother, keep quiet! You won't understand. Don't talk rubbish. I understand everything. The entire Mumbai knows you guys. Leave bhai's gang. And form your own gang. Mother, go! Do you know what you are saying? Do you know who bhai is? This bhai.. had replaced somebody. Hello! Hello! Hello, who is speaking? Hello! Hello! What, again you could not say anything? How many days are left? For the divorce to finalise. How many days? It is on my head! Then my dear, when will you talk if not now? Javed, I want to talk but.. My dear, a woman's heart is just like wax. It melts with just a few sweet words. I don't know how to talk sweetly! Try my dear! You cannot become a poet by harsh words. You have to talk sweetly for that. What did you say? What sweetly? What the.. Yes, yes, the F word. As usual used.. ..with a not a lack of relevance or context. To the most basic of human acts. Which is so explicitly and succinctly describes.. - Yes! A sad but unavoidable linguistic travesty.. ..of these modern times. Mr. Javed, are you a policeman.. ..or a boring professor? I feel like killing you. - Kasai! Oh no! - Oh no! Move aside! Move! Javed! Are you ok? - It is okay! Hey, move aside! Oh no! Hey! Let me go, otherwise I will kill her. I am telling you this. Hey Pandu, don't come in front. Hey! Not Pandu! Inspector! Inspector Kavi! Kaviraj Patil! Enough! Enough! Now the blood has stopped! Now you drink a little water Take this! It will pain a little. Rolling, madam! - Javed, how are you now? In one of the by lanes of Mumbai.. ..by the bullets of the ATS one more death. Proof, witness and courts, has the ATS forgotten all this.. ..and accepted the easy way of encounter? Looks like the police think that they are more superior.. - Easy! This all looks very easy to you? You enjoy.. degrading the police? Move aside the camera! Move it aside! They just barge in with their cameras wherever they want. A policeman is shot with a bullet! He could have died anytime. That looks easy to you, isn't it? What will you say about him? About Aslam Kasai! He has already killed ten people. You will not do anything about him. Everything looks easy for you. Fake press! You can justify how much ever you want. The facts say something else. Listen to this! 1987! Number of deaths and encounters.. ..with Mumbai police. 12. 1990! Number of deaths and encounters with ATS. 53! Numbers speak for themselves. But.. Wrong! In these two years the state of Mumbai had changed completely. Underworld! - There is no difference between.. ..you and the underworld. They are gangsters and you too gangsters. Gangsters in uniforms! There was a gang war between the two of you. You used to kill one of them. They used to kill one of you. Hey Chhotya! Hey Chhotya! Get up! Recognized! How are you? How is your brother? Tell me! Where is your brother! Get up! Get up! Come! Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I don't know where Gotya is? - Where is he? Where is your brother? I do not know! - You scoundrel! I don't know! Get up! Chhotya, what happened? Hey! Hey! Chhotya! Chhotya! What did you think? That we do not have.. ..any informer in the police. Come! Come down! Hey Chhotya! I hope you did not get hurt? Get up, you scoundrel! Beat him! Beat him! Chhotya! Chhotya! Hit him! Shut up! Tell me, you scoundrel. Tell me, you scoundrel! Tell us where is your informer? Where is your informer? Tell me! Tell me, you scoundrel! Aslam was killed! Aslam was killed! He was my brother! He was my brother! Why are you hitting him, he has not done anything. You are the sycophancy of the police. You are used to eating the police money. Now eat this! Take this in your mouth! Take it! You scoundrel! Open your mouth! Today I will make an example of him! What are you all watching? What are you all watching? You scoundrel! See this! Hey you, go to your son! Go. - Chhotya! Scoundrel! He was acting smart! What are you watching? Come here! What are you watching? - Nothing! - What? What did you see? - Nothing! You did not see anything? Your eyes are just a show piece in your head? You did not see the murder? - No! You scoundrel! You are lying! When the police comes, with the red light. Then you must tell them. Maya Bhai had come! Understood! Maya! Tomorrow you must tell the TV people. What? Three bullets were fired. Understood! Hey Buwa! Only three bullets! The TV people will not like it. Then take this! Sensational news item! You must tell them! What? Hey come on; enough! Come on! Ant.. Ant.. I am jaggery.. Hey! Have you called up that Wadhwani builder? Maya, I had called up! But he instead started threatening us. That he will not talk to hooligans like us. What? He will not talk! Hello! - Maya! - You! What do you want? I don't want! You want, sir! What? Protection! What do you say? What did you tell my boys? You too are a child still! Understood, Maya! And your father is there to protect me. I talk directly to Dubai. Understood! The one you are talking about, his hand will never.. ..reach up to your head from Dubai. Now what.. your wife, family, everyone is here! In Mumbai! And even I am here! In Mumbai! Understood! 40! Keep 40 lakhs ready! You scoundrel! Whom are you threatening? I have seen many like you coming and going! People like you not for forty lakhs.. ..but they die for four thousand everyday. Forget my number otherwise I will call your father in Dubai. Understood! Hey sit! Maya! - Hello! - You understood? - Yes, understood! 70 lakhs! Tomorrow! - 70! Hey you scoundrel! And now whatever cash you have, give it to us! Come on! For good luck! Come on! Come on! Hurry up! Come on! There is more? - No, there is no more! There is no more? - Hey, come on from here! Come on; leave from here! Listen oh my beloved! This love is very painful. You lose your heart and in return you get pain. My beloved, I thank you for the company you give me. I have no other work to do. I have no other work to do. I have become yours.. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have to live for my life, and I love you my beloved. I read your expressive face like the Gita. Your youth and my love! Your youth and my love have united together. I have become yours.. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have become yours and immersed in your love. Listen you oh my beloved! Listen you oh my beloved. Now I don't like it anywhere. When I see you only then I feel a little peace. I am the thread.. I am the thread of love. I am the thread.. I am the thread of love. You have become my beloved! I have become yours.. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have become yours and immersed in your love. I have become yours and immersed in your love. Janu! I hope you are not hurt, Janu! Oh my God! Hey you, what did you do? Maya, what did you do? Hey, shut up! That I was throwing one by one.. ..my hand hurt her, what could I do? You will hurl the full bundle at her? What, you will throw the full bundle? Hey, you keep quiet! See! Hey Phatu, you don't instigate him. See, her eye is completely black! Show! Show! One minute! One minute! Leave me! - This is kohl! See, this is kohl! Kohl! Kohl! Buwa, this is kohl! I told you not to touch her! So what if it is kohl? Her full face has become red! Show! - Let me see! Buwa this is rouge! Move! Are you all doctors? Hey, leave her! Hey, are you a doctor? See how this lover boy is angry! Elder brother! - Yes! - Your phone! I have told you not to touch her! Lover boy! Yes, Maya! - Maya! How are you, Maya? Bhai! How are you Bhai! I am fine! Fit! You tell me! Maya, Wadhwani had called up! And you know that he is our direct party. Then why are you giving him tension? You go just now and apologize to him. Today itself! Understood! Bhai, Maya will never apologize to anyone. Not to anyone! - What did you say? Bhai, what is this? You are comfortably sitting there.. ..on your golden throne. And here we slog for you. We take risks for you here! We rule the entire Mumbai for you. If we have to go and apologize to these people. ..then how will we work, bhai? Then what do you want to do? I will take the money! The full amount! The amount that I had told him. That much! Bhai, Maya can never go back on his word. It is my prestige! What? They were dancing and singing in the bar! What were you all doing, sucking your thumbs? They used to change their hideouts everyday. To bring them out we pressurised their families.. ..and their associates. They are fresh! - Yes, very fresh! Okay, give me! You took the money! Greetings, aunt! Hey, aunt! At least give the money. The money for the fish! You scoundrel! - The money for the fish! Do I look like aunt to you? - Hey, what are you doing? I look like aunt to you? You scoundrel! Oh madam! Mr. Khan has called you! Come. Where is Maya? He may be somewhere! Sometimes here sometimes there. You are acting very smart! The day your son will be shot by the police.. ..all your smartness will go. Hey! You go and threaten some one else with the name of the police. I know what you policemen are! He used to beat me like an animal for years. At that time you policemen just watched like eunuchs. My Maya was just nine years old. But even then he was a man! Kill him! Maya, Kill him! I have given birth to him. Now even if I have to kill him, I will not surrender him to you. Okay, sir! I am going! I have to cook fish. That means Phatu is not your son? - No! Amazing! But in this file it is written that Phatu alias.. ..Mouiddin Akmal! His name is Phatim! But he was born here! Now we have nothing to do with him. Is it? Your neighbours say that he comes here everyday. Look here brother, he is a heart patient. Have mercy on us and go away from here. If I come to know that you have given shelter to a culprit.. ..then I will put both of you behind bars. Understood! Greetings! Hi! Wow! Wow! What a dress? But.. it does not suit you. What do you say.. not at all! Where is your, that dress? Have you kept it in the bag? That one! Those small, small ones! What are you saying? You have come here to dance, isn't it? To increase the glamour here! Did you see; the best bar dancer of Deepa bar! Look here; this is the wedding of a decent family. Even prostitutes dance in decent weddings. You know the meaning of a prostitute? The same.. whore! Sir, what is this you are saying? Uncle, what is this? We are waiting for her dance.. ..and you are not saying anything to her. She is our guest! - Guest? This? You did not tell uncle? That means, you must have not told uncle that.. ..you are the item of the most famous underworld.. Bhai. She is the keep! She is Buwa's keep! Uncle! Don't you know Buwa? But our plan backfired on us! They did come out, but at the wrong place and the wrong time. Shamsher, one thing! Only one thing can you remember? That you are someone's father before you are a policeman. You are someone's husband. Greetings, sir! My dear, go to your mama! Hey you scoundrel! You are building your body to fight with us? What you look? Hey! You had gone to act smart with my Tannu! What? Hey Buwa! Leave him! Today we have come just to talk to him. I do not want to talk to you, I am with my family. Even I thought the same thing! Family! Even I have a family! Then why did Khan go.. ..and threaten my mother? Was that right? Henceforth if you even touch my wife and my child.. ..then I will kill you! Do not act so smart! Don't be so smart! My dear, go in! If not about yourself, then think about your wife and child. By God, we will make your life! Hey, Rafiq, tell him! Posting! Posting! Promotion! Promotion! Talk about cash! If you have money.. ..then you can pacify your item. She will not come back by you just making your body. What do you say RC? Will she come? Hey Buwa, she will come! She will come to us? Hey you scoundrel! She will come, won't she? Listen! You take a big house, a big car! Tell me how much do you want? I will tell you what I want! All those scoundrels that are born here like you. A file is made and it comes to our office. Now there are so many files that there is no place.. ..to keep our feet. There is only one way to clean the office. The person is dead; then the file too is no more. The office of the Mumbai police is so small. And I have made the entire Mumbai as my office. Whatever I have is given by God! - Oh my God! And we are very happy with that! We do not want anything else. But I would like to tell you one thing. There is still time; change for the better. Otherwise you will spend the rest of your life in jail. We will go to jail? Rafiq, do you want to go to jail? What are you talking about jail? Even I don't want to go to jail Then don't go! Then don't go to jail! Go and bring my revolver! I will kill you right here! Hey! Don't threaten me! - Hey, what will you do? What will you do? Hey, skinny, move! Let me do my exercises. Hey you! I will beat you with that bench. Hey Buwa! Leave him! We will take care of him later. I am going! But before I go I will tell you one thing. This.. This game is between us! It has nothing to do with the family. You stay away from our family and we will stay.. ..away from your family. There can be only one thing between you and me. Kill or die! What? Will you do an encounter? You policemen really fool the public. You pick up some goon and kill him in the by lanes. Then you keep the revolver in the hands of the dead body.. ..and the next day in the news on TV.. headlines! Publicity! In a sensational encounter a goon was bravely killed. You people do not understand what we say. You only understand the language of the gun. And see, one day your dead body will be found.. ..Iying in some alley. The lanes open on both the sides, Khan! I will wait for that day. - Even I will! Maybe we may meet, or we may not! But I will tell you one thing! I felt nice after meeting you. At least there is one policeman whose uniform.. ..still has that.. My lndia is great! I have spoken to you for so long, don't think.. ..that I will even wait for a second before I shoot you. Even I will shoot! Maybe.. before you can shoot. Mumbai! Ganpat, bring liquor. Ganpat, bring liquor. More of soda and less of water. More of soda and less of water. Clean the table. Come on. Clean the table. Come on. Ganpat! - Ganpat! Ganpat! - Ganpat! Come on! Come on! And everybody. Come on! Come on! And move your body. Come on! Come on! And shake your body. Shake your ass.

I won't spare the one who looks here. Tell me if there is a problem. Everybody is afraid of me. Give some coke to my friends. Give some coke to my friends. Ganpat! - Ganpat! Ganpat, bring liquor. In the Mumbai. All over lndia. We are the goons. We are the goons. In the Mumbai. All over lndia. We are the goons. We are the goons. Be it Bipasha or Aishwarya Rai. We can go anywhere. Yash Copra and Subhash Gai make movies on us. And they make money. I want special tea during daytime. Liquor in the evening, girl at night and then sleep. Ganpat! - Ganpat! Come on! Look at me, girl. I am everywhere, girl. You are heart, I am life, girl. Shake your ass. Shake your ass. Shake your ass. Look at me, girl. I am everywhere, girl. You are heart, I am life, girl. Shake your ass. Shake your ass. Shake your ass. In the Mumbai. All over lndia. We are the goons. We are the goons. In the Mumbai. We are the goons. We are the goons. Come on! Come on! And everybody. Come on! Come on! And move your body. Come on! Come on! And shake your body. In the Mumbai. All over lndia. We are the goons. We are the goons. Ganpat! Ganpat! Ganpat! Who is Ganpat? What did you thought? That Khan will get scared? Khan has killed 26 people till date. And you! 30! 30! 30! 30! We have killed 30! If he killed you all.. then his count will be 31. So should we fear him? Since when he is threatening us! Sometimes his mother, at times my girlfriend's threat. Am I a eunuch that I will sing! Oh my! When will you all stop thinking like street goons? This is what Khan wants. That you all lose your temper.. and come out of your hiding. And then he could target you all. That's why.. he and his men are threatening your family. Rohini! Heena! Isn't this what you wanted? - Yes. Then sign and end the matter. Is it so easy for you to break this marriage? This marriage broke a long time ago. Rohini, I am sorry. Sorry? For what all things will you say sorry? Do you know what is going on in your family? Your daughter failed in the exams for the first time. You don't come home for 4 days. You don't answer my call. Rohini.. I had told you what a policeman's job is like. How is it? If you had told me, I would have tried to understand. What could I have said, Rohini? That what kind of things l have to deal with everyday. Gangster who kills somebody just for a few thousand. The terrorist who hangs tire around somebody's neck.. ..and burns him in the middle of the road. The father who rapes his 5 years old daughter. Should I have told you all these things?

Why did you come back, fool? To tell you people.. that I am not a coward! Tell me. Bhai, here the entire police force.. ..has surrounded me and my men. Don't they have any other work to do? Bhai, make a few calls. You had said that you will look after Mumbai work. So you only do something. As it is, Maya. From Dubai I can't pull the strings. This is what I wanted to hear! You only trapped us. What are you saying, Maya? Because if Maya escaped from here.. ..then I will reach to you in Dubai. Understand? 302! Residents of Swati building! Listen carefully!

Tripathi, I will give you so much money.. ..that you can never earn in your life! I am ready to do kissing scenes in my movies. But my hero too should be ready. Don't you think there can be some problem from the censor board? Look, this is 1991. India reached 18 years of age in 1985. I don't understand.. why our censor board.. ..doesn't allow adults scenes? After all why do we have democracy? Look, I don't want to create any controversy. I will do what I want to do! Nobody can stop me! Quickly do the touch up! Ma'am, all the police vans are heading towards Andheri west. Let's go. What were you asking? - I will just come! Hello! Hello! Hello! Come and do the final touch-up. Hello.

Are you fine? - Yeah. How many men? - Sir, 5 to 10 maximum. Weapons? Hand gun. Besides that nothing, sir. What have you done? There was only one rocket launcher! You wasted that too!

Mother.. will you make it for me? Go! Go home! I will hang up, Maya! Hello. Father. I don't want to talk to you! Please don't hang up, father! For God's sake, don't hang up! At least hear what he wants to say. What to hear? Has he ever listened to me that I will listen to him! I was wrong, father. I was always wrong. You were right.

They have fired RPG on us, sir! They have wounded 3 policemen! Nobody will talk to them! This is insubordination, Khan! You can't talk to me like this! I don't want to talk to you, sir. I just want to do my work! Khan! I am giving you final warning! I know those guys are ready to surrender! I am going inside to talk to them! Khan, how dare you! Sir! JCP Tripathi is interfering in my operation, sir! Give him the phone. - Right, sir. Tripathi, here! Tripathi, what are you doing there? Sir, I was just.. On whose order? - Sir.. On whose order, Tripathi? I have given Khan complete authority. He will handle the situation. Sir, what is the order for me? You stop interfering in other's work, Tripathi. Don't intrude. Come back. Come back right now. Get out of that place, Tripathi! - Sir! Let's go! Bhua! Bhua! Come on! Sir! Maya's mother wants to meet you! Call her. Come! I know.. what you people are doing! You all are killers not policemen! Is your son Mother Teresa? Sir, let him go. I will explain to him. He will surrender. I will talk to him. You will explain to him? Earlier you used to roam around smugly! Because your son is a big goon! Because of mothers like you he has become like this! Today he will die! No, sir! Just.. today leave him. Leave him. I will talk to him. Go away! Otherwise I will shoot you too in an encounter! Understand! Get out! Hey! Get this! Patil! Kadam! Is everybody in their position? Sir! We caught him from inside! Come! Where are you taking him? - Sir, I am.. Come! Come here! I said shoot to kill! Send the men to the roof! Go! Yes, sir! RC, what happened? What happened? Ghosts! Ghosts are dead!

Hey, officer? That's it? Javed! I will be released within 2 days! Within 2 days! Sir! He is still alive! No wonder Human Rights.. have come out with a rally. Yes, these people.. who can roam freely on the roads! They can speak their mind! Because people like me have given them the freedom. Otherwise there are many places in this country.. ..where people have to hide at home. They can't talk freely. Because of people like me.. criminals are afraid of the police. A person thinks twice before murdering somebody. Who are Maya and Bhua? How can their lives benefit anybody? Please tell me, Mr. Dingra. Your Honour! In the past few days I had serious discussion.. ..with my client ACP S S. Khan. And I have reached the conclusion.. ..that I don't want to argue much about this case. I don't want to present any proof or evidence. I just want to ask one question. One question. From this court.. this society and this country! Just one question. It's not a legal question. The question is about your and my family. Your Honour! You too have a house, a family, wife and children. Right now your wife and children are alone at home. And a man is standing outside your house.. ..with a gun in his hand. Who do you want that man to be? And what do you all want? If a man is standing outside your house.. ..with a gun in his hand. Who do you want that man to be? Maya.. Bhua.. or ACP Shamsher Khan? Your Honour, I don't want you to give a big decision in this matter. I just want.. you to give a simple answer of my simple question. That's all, Your Honour! Thank you. The high court has declared the.. ..decision in shootout at Lokhandwala case. All the members of ATS have been declared innocent. You can assume this as prosecution's weakness.. ..or ex-justice Dingra's strong defence. Is this justice? Or the police officers who killed 6 people.. ..in Lokhandwala, was that justice? No! Today Mumbai police's encounter specialist has won. But the biggest decision is still to be taken. What Khan and his men did, was that right or wrong? And you have to this decision, the people of this country.
