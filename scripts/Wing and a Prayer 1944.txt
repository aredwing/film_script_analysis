Committee demands probe of navy failure to fight. Where is our navy? Why doesn't it fight? We cannot answer that question. We must force ourselves not to listen to it. We do not intend to tell theJapanese how badly our navy was damaged at Pearl Harbor. Since December the 7 th, our prewar strategy is useless. The defense of the Aleutians and our Pacifc Coast with the Hawaiis at the apex of the Triangle is almost impossible with what remains of our navy. But we are not considering a defensive campaign. You all realize I'm indulging in no false heroics when I say our only hope of evading destruction is to destroy the enemy. TheJapanese have won a quick and staggering succession of victories. They're aiming now at the fnal knockout... the capture of Pearl Harbor. To accomplish this, they must frst take Midway. If they are permitted to choose the time and conditions of attack, we haven't much of a chance, but if we can trick them into meeting us when they think we are weak, we then have a chance of cutting their navy down to our size and proceeding with the rest of the Pacifc strategy. We have learned there are heavy concentrations of enemy carriers and other fleet units in the Marshall Islands and a numerous transport force making up at Truk. So our strategy is this. We shall concentrate our strength near Midway in our effort to spring a trap. One of our carriers is already at sea waiting to carry out the initial phases of this strategy. On April the 28th, this carrier and its escort will be off the Marshall Islands, close enough to be detected. On May the 3rd, it is to be seen near the Gilbert Islands by theJapanese. On May the 8th, it will be detected near Ocean Island, as if heading for theJap fleet at Truk, but it will not attack. It will turn south, be seen on May the 15th at Guadalcanal. Every time one of our pilots encounters a Jap plane, he will return to the carrier, as if he did not stomach a fght. By sending this one carrier on such a mission, we hope to convince the enemy that our fleet is scattered, our fghting morale... shattered. Actually, we shall be waiting for them in force near Midway. If they fall for this bait and attempt an invasion, we shall then be able to answer the question... "Where is our navy? Why doesn't it fght?" Pilot to crew. There's mama. I see her, Commander. Pilot to crew. If you need a toothpick, I know where you can fnd one. We'd only need half that space, Mr. Scott. Just lower your wheels and drop your hook, like putting a baby to bed. Set condition one in the air department. Stand by to land planes. Stand by to land planes. Torpedo planes sighted broad on the port quarter. Altitude 2-5-0-0. Range 8,000 yards. Stand by for practice run. If those were only meatballs instead ofTBFs. O.K. Hook. Stand clear. I'm O'Donnell, commanding Bomber Six. Welcome aboard. Molton, commanding Torpedo Five. What's the scuttlebutt? What gives? I thought we'd fnd out when we got aboard. Not from us. I thought with you guys aboard, we'd have some action. Name's Shubert. I'm Manning. We're on a cook's tour. Your guess is as good as mine. See you around. Sir. Lieutenant Commander Edward Molton reporting for Torpedo Squadron Five. Glad to have you aboard. Molton, Commander Harper, our air offcer. How do you do? Good to see you. I've a message for you. Hey, what's eating Oscar? Sure making a long approach. He's building up an entrance. Just feel your way in, sir. Lightly. And politely. Do we have to shoot him down? What does he want, a spotlight? He's coming in too fast. Can't he see that wave-off? [Siren Sounds] Assemble your squadron in the ready room. Aye, aye, sir. Boy, I thought for a while there... until 1900... I thought I'd have to turn back. Maybe you should have. Didn't you see the wave-off? Yes, sir. Did you think the flagman was waving bye-bye? To tell you the truth, I couldn't think. I had my hands too full of airplane at the time. Oh. But... Oh, men, this is our air offcer Commander Harper. Commander Harper, this is Mr. Brainard, Mr. Chisholm. Mr. Markham. How do you do? Mr. Jacobson. How do you do? Mr. White. Sir. Mr. Holloway. Mr. Scott. How do you do? I'm glad to know you and welcome you aboard. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. You've been assigned to quarters which I hope you fnd to your liking. We have some pretty good men on board. I've been very proud of all of our squadrons... torpedoes, bombers, and fghters. I hope you equal their record. Read that, please, Mr. Molton. Aloud. "Memorandum for commander, Air Group Five. Subject... Report of casualty which occurred during maneuvers, September 19, 1941. Roy K. Spangler, number 4328112, aviation machinist's mate, frst class, United States Navy, died at 1600 while under anesthesia for surgery following accident on flight deck. Spangler's next of kin, his mother Mrs. Edward R. Spangler, 3617 Lee Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Signed J.B. Golden, commander, senior medical offcer." A hot pilot ignored a wave-off. Spangler couldn't get out of the way. The prop cut him nearly in half. I'm sorry, sir. So was the other pilot. So was Spangler's mother. I'd like to explain, sir... I don't like explanations. Secure. Sorry, sir. The way you and the others had to take it on account of me. Just don't ignore any more wave-offs. Aye, aye, sir. Mr. Scott. Here's some mail for you. Oh, thanks. I see the movie fans haven't forgotten you, sir. Cunningham? Yes, sir. I've received this letter from the admiral. I thought you'd like to read it. Congratulations. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! I give you Cookie Cunningham! The man who studied Japanese mathematics and found you always get the right answer by subtracting zero. Who says we don't know where we're going? I tell you what I'm going to do. I'll fly my TBF clear to Tokyo. I'll drag that little monkey to 15,000 and drop him like a bomb, right smack on Fujiyama. I can't stand the canned vegetables you get on shipboard. But our squadron's different. We'll have fresh vegetables. How come? How? You going to plow up the flight deck? No, I'm not kidding. We'll have some fresh celery, real juicy tomatoes, green onions... What are you going to use for dirt? Water and chemicals. That's the agriculture of the future. Ya-hoo! Hey, fellows! Look! Get a load of this! Wait a minute! Hey, wait! Now don't do that. You did it! It shows it right there. You kissed Betty Grable. If I didn't see it, I wouldn't believe it. Did you ever kiss Garbo? I've never seen her. When you're in a picture and you have to kiss Betty Grable... Listen to me... have to... When you kiss her, what's it feel like? Ah, let it lay. I'm serious about this, Oscar. I really mean it. I mean, do you feel anything at all, or is it all just part of the day's work? Does she breathe deep? Does she kiss you or you her? Does she kiss back? What I want to know is, how does it make you feel? The rest of us can only dream about those girls, but you've actually kissed them. What's it like? Well, it's, uh... it's like nothing else in this world. - Ahh. - Ahh. I'll never forget that frst girl I kissed in a picture. Who was it? Yeah. Who? You think I'd kiss and tell? In a wardroom? Come on, Oscar. Well, it's, um... The night before the scene was to be shot, I didn't sleep. I lay awake all night, just daydreaming about that kiss. How do you daydream at night? Quiet. Well, how do you? The next morning I got to the studio an hour earlier, got into my wardrobe, dashed over to the set. I waited all day for that one moment when I'd get to kiss her. Finally, it was time for the scene to be shot. We took our places. She was wearing the most beautiful black negligee. Lovely... revealing. Her hair was swept back from her forehead. Her eyes were partly closed. I took her into my arms... Go on. Kiss her, you dope! The hairdresser yelled, "You're mussing up her hairdo." The director screamed, " Move your arm. You're tilting her collar." The cameraman said, "I can't see her nose." So I kissed her off-center and smacked the air. If you want to kiss a girl right, you got to join the navy. Hey! You can't get away with that! Hey! Hey! Gather 'round. I want to tell you something. Your worries are over. Listen to the voice of Superman. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll fly my TBF clear to Tokyo. Throw a rope around Tojo's neck, like I roped coyotes back in Texas. I'll drag that monkey to 15,000 feet and drop him like a bomb... Very funny. I wouldn't want to bore you guys with what I'm really going to do. It sure takes a load off our minds. That guy there might possibly give you a few pointers. He's only shot down three Zeros. I'm just a bag of wind from Texas. I must sound funny to a guy who's done the things you've done. How do you feel when those meatballs come at you? I didn't see them until they were pretty close. Did they attack from above? From below. They missed with their frst pass. They say they can attack, pull out, and dive again before you see them. Slow but with maneuverability? I don't know, really... They machine-gun you on the way down? I'm writing my memoirs for the Saturday Evening Post. You can read them after the war. All right. Break it up. Let's cut a record. Hey, you want me to make another one? I could knock that moon out of the sky. Leave it alone. I'll need that moon when I get home. Right on the beam, kid. What's your name? Benjamin K. O'Neal, sir. Aviation radioman, frst class. Did you come in with Torpedo Five? That's right, sir. Haven't you served under me before? I was in and out of Pensacola, sir. I thought I'd seen you before. As you were. # Bring back # # Bring back my Bonny to me # #To me... ## What's wrong, Benny? I've been ducking him since I came on board. If he fgures how long ago he saw me, he'll ground me sure. How come? Too old for air combat duty. Are you kidding? There's no law... That man's the whole navy in one pair of pants. Do you know what kind of guy he is? He's the only offcer whose men wouldn't give him a nickname. What's the matter? What if he fnds out about me? What about you? Benny, how old would you take me to be? Oh, I'd say about 20, 21. Thanks. But if he ever sees my birth certifcate, I'm cooked. When I joined the navy, I made a mistake about my age. You mean you weren't 17? I won't be 17 for 3 months. So that's the way it is. We're either too old or young. Well, kid, we're in this together. # Every tear # #Will be a memory # # So wait and pray # # Each night for me # #Till we meet again ## [Ding Ding] [Ding Ding] Well, gentlemen... we have our orders. [Plays Reveille] Do it again. I love it. Come on, Scott. 30 minutes to flight quarters. O.K., O.K. Come on. Come on. No wonder they gave you the Navy Cross. Waking people up at night, you have to be a hero. Your squadron ahead of ours? I'm not flying right now. Just shower call and such. I was on the sick list after Pearl Harbor. Still wobbly on the pins. Wake Chisholm, will you? Yeah. Good morning. I'll need fve empty fuel containers, some potassium nitrate, some calcium nitrate, manganese sulfate... Mananganese what, sir? Manganese sulfate, and about 30 feet of wire mesh. And get lots of excelsior from the engine packings, and, um... a big ball of heavy string. Yeah. Very good, sir. May I ask what all these things are for, sir? Tomatoes. Oh, tomatoes. When you return from your search, you will notice the carrier will be towing a sled. It's more like a spar about the size of a telephone pole. As each plane comes in, it will make one pass, dropping its bomb well astern of the sled. Don't hit it. We don't want the flight deck showered with bomb fragments. Every hour we continue on our present course brings nearer the possibility of contact with enemy aircraft. Your orders are these. When enemy planes are encountered... do not engage them. Return to the carrier at once. By "Do not engage," you mean... I mean avoid all contact with them. But, sir, that's running away. Any other questions? But suppose the enemy attacks us, sir? May we interpret the orders... You will not interpret the orders. You will obey them. Pilots, man your planes. Pilots, man your planes. That's all. Let's go. Pilot to Radioman. You got the dope on the radio frequencies? Radioman to Pilot. Yes, sir. Frequency 69-70. Secondary 61-50. All set, sir. Pilot to Gunner. Gunner to Pilot. All set, sir. Maybe I'll get my frst meatball today. If you see anyJaps, blow them a kiss. But don't shoot... that's an order. Pilots... stand by to start engines. Stand clear propellers. Start engines. [Engine Starts] Oh, boy! I ought to pop you on the chin. That's how Billy Tom knocked me out. I was born with a glass jaw, but otherwise, in the torso, I'm unvulnerable. Come on. Hit me. Infnitestimal fortitude. That's what I calls it. Rock of Gibraltar. Hold everything. What you got there? Oh, isn't she lovely? [Wolf Whistles] Look at that! Wow! A love note. Come on, read it. Get out. Come on. "Dearest Hallam, I couldn't sleep thinking how lucky the girl was in your picture I saw last night and thinking how wonderful it would be if I could have been her and feel your strong arms around me... and your lips pressed close to mine." - Wait a minute! - Hey! Hey, get a load of this, fellas. "Dear hunk of man, I'm a hep chick who thinks you're a solid piece of what it takes." Potassium phosphate, potassium nitrate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium nitrate. O.K. What are you going to use these for? Shh. Tomatoes. Tomatoes. Tomatoes? Yeah. I'm glad you dropped in, Mr. Cunningham. I wanted to congratulate you on your citation. Thank you very much, Commander. [Whistling My Bonny Lies Over The Ocean] Sir, the medical offcer says I'm completely O.K. Again, in every respect. That's great. You agree with the M. O? Yes, sir. I'd like reassignment to flight duty as soon as possible. All right, Cunningham. As soon as possible. Thank you, sir. O.K. Torpedo Squadron Five returning from search, sir. Mmm. Nice kid, that Cunningham. Yes, sir. #The stars at night # #Are big and bright # [Fires Four Times] # Deep in the heart ofTexas # #The prairie sky # # Is wide and high # [Fires Four Times] # Deep in the heart ofTexas ## What are you shooting at, Mr. Scott? Well, nothing. I'm just testing my guns. Oh. All personnel, clear the afterdeck during bombing practice. All personnel, clear the afterdeck during bombing practice. 200 yards astern of the sled. 10 yards to starboard. Foley, watch that sled. Hear this! All flight deck personnel form line aport ship. Clear deck of bomb fragments. [Whistle] Lieutenant Commander Molton, report to Air Plot. Lieutenant Commander Molton, report to Air Plot. Landing against wave-offs, blowing up the sled. Are you trying to kill half the men here? I'll talk with him, sir. I want that man grounded. Take that whole squadron in hand, or I will. Is that clear? Quite clear, sir. That's all. [Laughing] Got a match, Paducah? Oh, yeah. You've gotten off to a bad start on this carrier. There was very little excuse for you, Scott, and none at all for you today, Brainard. Hitting that sled wasn't just carelessness. No, sir. I wanted to see if I could hit something. You will. You're going to hit the deck. You're grounded. Grounded, sir? Report to the squadron duty offcer as his assistant until further orders. Yes, sir. Secure. [Whistle] Attention, all hands. Movies for tonight... Alice Faye and Betty Grable in Tin Pan Alley. The way this navy operates, we'll be expected to take one look at their gams and run. Oh, uh, Cunningham, I talked to your commanding offcer. You go up tomorrow. Thank you, sir. That's all. Be sure the plants get plenty of sun, and keep this excelsior moist. The chemicals in the water will do the rest. In a few weeks we'll have some nice, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, celery, onions. Yes, sir. Arnie Devlin was flying my wing. Arnie Devlin was flying my wing. He got the frst Zero. The others dove past, came up under my tail. I got one. Then two more came head on. I couldn't escape them, so I fred on them. One exploded... the other fell in flames. Do they bust up when they're hit? They fall apart. There's so much magnesium, they just can't take it. Here's where you made the mistake. This type of cruiser has three stacks. There's a slight wrinkle, very little superstructure amidship. It didn't show on the quarterdecks. I see it now. Look how widely-spaced they are. Very little superstructure. Have you noticed? How about a little acey-deucy? Sure. It goes through this little gadget. That's the sound exciter. Please. We won't get anywhere this way. Will we? Go away. Go away. Go. Come on, you boot camp fanatics. We want to see Betty Grable. Uh-uh. Is there something wrong? You're diving at 15,000 feet... angle, 45-degree, air speed 380, and you release a 1,000-pound bomb at 2,000 feet. I've got to fgure the effect of gravity and air resistance. Gravity's got nothing to do with the forward motion of a projectile. Say, you're right. I've been right for 35 years. "Dearest lover boy, how I wish we could meet in person. We could have some swell times together." What are you doing? Come on, give me. A welterweight. I can train down, can't I? Beautiful. Beautiful. A doll. There! Let's see the picture now. Shall we? Yeah, let's see it. Come on. All right, all right. Pipe down. Whoopsie-daisy. He's the sheik of Araby His faithful wives are we But life is such a ball... [Whistling And Jeering] The flm broke. We can't help that, can we? [Whistling And Jeering] Go back to boot camp! Stand by for emergency signal. Stand by for emergency signal. Come on now, men. Patience, patience! I'm ready. Aw, look at that. It's upside down! Notify the escort we're changing course. 0-3-4 true. Speed 22 knots. Signal Bridge. Send the following message... Course 0-3-4 true. Speed 22 knots. [Chanting And Jeering] You want to see this, or don't you? Yeah, go on! All right. [Bell Rings And Reveille Plays] All hands. Man your battle stations. [Bell Rings] [Whistle] All hands. Man your battle stations. All hands. Man your battle stations. I guess this is it, sir. This is it. Torpedo Five ready room. Is that you, Brainard? Yeah, Red. All pilots present. [Explosions] Hey, do you hear that? [Explosions] I heard it, and I felt it, too. [Explosions] Our escort must be dropping depth charges. Hey, Red. Give us the lowdown, will you? Looks like we've hit the jackpot. We've picked up a submarine and some night snoopers. Submarines and planes. Must be a wholeJap task force out there. Why don't they brief us? Ready. We're getting the dope now. Sir, message from Signal Bridge. Escort reports submarine no longer detected on sound screen. C.V. To Escort. Resume formation. C.V. To Escort. Resume formation. They're turning around. Aren't we going to flight? Are you kidding? What kind of war is this? We can't shootJaps. Now we're running away. That's enough. Good night. Commander Harper. Operations for tomorrow. Six TBFs on intermediate patrol, four hours. Takeoff 0600. Six SB2Cs. 150-mile search. Takeoff 0600. Speed up, flight 31. [Siren] Right full rudder. Stop all engines. Left full rudder! Notify escort to pick up survivors. Continue launching planes. Start that second fugle line. Tough break. Too bad, Cook. Ensign Cunningham wanted in Air Plot. Ensign Cunningham wanted in Air Plot. Probably Harper. They get tougher. What was the matter? Engine? No, sir. Me. I'm sorry about the plane, sir. That can't be helped, but we won't take any more chances. For now, you'll serve better at a shore base. Sir, this may sound funny, but I'm sure I'm O.K. The shock of the crash was just what I needed. If you'll give me one more... We can't take any more chances. That's all. Yes, sir. Mr. Scott. Zeros at 5 o'clock. Hold your fre. Remember orders. [Machine Gun Fire] [Machine Gun Fire] The last thing I saw was theJaps diving to strafe Gus after his plane hit the water. He didn't have a ghost of a chance. When they dived at him, each of the three planes opened up with everything they had. Gus' plane was still burning. I could see the flames. Never mind that. Let's get back to theJap planes. Did you see anything which might have indicated the presence of an enemy task force? I'm afraid I wasn't watching. What was your approximate position? In my area of search, it was possibly 150 miles southeast. Possibly? I'm pretty sure. I got out of there as fast as I could, according to orders. Are you sure there were only three enemy planes? Could there have been more? How can I tell you what I didn't see? I saw the three of them make a pass at Gus' plane, coming down out of the sun. You're not certain they were Zeros? Did you notice the shape of their wings or whether they had single or multiple engines? I can't remember exactly, sir. Oh, come on now, Scott. Pull yourself together. Yes, sir. I'm trying to tell you, sir, that this oneJap, the frst, came in and made his pass under Gus' tail, then rolled over on his back and began to shoot. Gus' engine began to smoke, and the plane went into a dive. Scott, from what direction did the enemy planes approach? I told you, from out of the sun. That can mean anything. Sorry. That's the best I can tell you. What was your altitude? I think it was about 2,500. What was theJaps' altitude? I don't know, sir. They were diving when I saw them. If only I could have gone back to help Gus. Look, Scott... let's forget about Chisholm. You understand that? Very well, sir. I'll try. [Knock On Door] Come in. Sir, a destroyer is coming alongside. All right. We'll go on with this later. Yes, sir. Is that all, sir? That's all. [Brakes Squeal] [Alarm Sounds] Now hear this. The smoking lamp is out throughout the ship. The smoking lamp is out throughout the ship. Hey, Paducah, the smoking lamp. I heard it. I heard it. Do you think I'm deaf? [Chattanooga Choo-Choo Plays] Is that the best you can do? Yeah. That's the best I can do. I'm no hero. I haven't got any citation from the admiral. I haven't shot down any Zero. Look here, Scott. I'm sorry. Well, then, shut up. Wait a minute, you two. Take it easy. What is this? Sorry. I guess we're all a little jumpy. Relax. As for you, Scott, there are no stars here. This isn't Hollywood. When it's time for you to take your bows, we'll turn on the spotlights. Now you're just a part of a team, and you'll play as the team plays. Understood? Yes, sir. [Chattanooga Choo-Choo Plays Loudly] [Blows Whistle] Now hear this. Now hear this. The captain will address the personnel of the ship. Men, ever since Pearl Harbor, our country has been asking, "Where is our navy? Why don't they fght?" Because of our unorthodox maneuvers, I know you've been asking the same question. I must confess, so have I. We've suffered many casualties, dead and wounded. We've been humiliated. We've had to avoid combat and run away from the enemy when we've been aching to knock them clean out of the sky. We asked ourselves why we're not permitted to fight, why we could not avenge our dead, strike back in our defense. Five minutes ago, I received a message which answers all our questions. After Pearl Harbor, our country was faced with its greatest disaster. The situation was desperate, and only a desperate and brilliant strategy could save us. Our navy pinned its hope on one thing... theJapanese inability to deviate from a plan once it had been made. We knew their next move was to capture Pearl Harbor, but first they'd have to take Midway. We deceived theJaps by making them think we'd scattered over the ocean, that Midway would be a pushover. In the meanwhile, we secretly concentrated our entire naval strength at Midway. That was our trap. You men, this carrier, and her escort were the bait to that trap. It was a nasty job. It has cost us heavily in men and equipment. TheJaps thought they saw four of our carriers at widely separated places. They only saw one. That was us. Three times Tokyo reported us sunk. Twice, we nearly were, but we're still afloat. I'm happy to tell you the strategy has worked. The trap has been sprung. Believing us scattered over the ocean, the mainJap fleet is headed for Midway. They're going in for the kill. So are we. We're through running away. We're through pulling punches. Our mission is accomplished, and from here on in, we fight. - Yay! - Yay! TheJap fleet is headed for Midway in three columns. One is here with the carrier Soyu. One is here with the carrier Kaga. One is with the carrier Hiru. Now, their rear is protected by a formation headed by the cruisers Mikuma and Mogami. Our heavy ships are hopelessly outnumbered. TheJap fleet mustn't be allowed to get within range of them. The battle of Midway must be won in the air by this carrier's planes, two that will join us, and the fortresses on Midway. When theJaps fnd out what they've run into, they're going to come after you with everything they've got, but this is the battle we've been praying for. We've got it... on our own grounds, on our own terms. Good luck. Pilots... stand by to start engines. Stand clear propellers. Start engines. B.G., all set? Ready, sir. O'Neal, got your recognition code straight? Yes, sir. One for this morning and one for this afternoon. We'll celebrate tonight with a nice, fresh vegetable salad. The frst from my seagoing farm. Sir, last enemy position, bearing 2-1-5 true, 150 miles. Molton to Squadron, there's our target. Molton to Squadron, remember, when you think you're in close, go in closer before you drop that fsh. Molton to Squadron, join up. Come on, join up. Lacobson, rendezvous, join up. I can't. There's a Zero on your tail. There's one on yours, too. Ioin up. You all right, Hale? Yeah, Mr. Molton. Relay this throughout the ship. Radio Room? Relay these messages throughout the ship. Wassum's out like a flower. Stand by for anything. There ought to be fighters. Watch that Zero up there. He won't budge. He's an old-timer. What's that Zero doing, Hank? He ain't saying. Lust hanging there. They'll make a pass soon. They tagging our outfit? Are you kidding? Shut up. Never mind the crystal ball gazing. Come on, you... Shut up! 12 o'clock! Something coming through the formation. Wait till they come in. Where's our fighters? Watch the ponies up there. All right, all right. [Gunfire] Criminy! There's another batch coming! All right, I've got him! You take him, Joe! Two more at 2 o'clock over your right wing. Get him! [Gunfire] Got him. Shut up. Everybody all right? Pilot to... 11 o'clock! Cri-ola. Ya-hoo! Shut up, will you... 11 o'clock! They're rolling under. I got it. Key-ristmas! How many are there? Smack 'em down! Let 'em come around! All right, all right. Swing us around. Got him! Got him! 11 o'clock! Ed! Ed! [Gunfire] They got Ed. No, I'm all right. Ed, is that you? Yeah. They got Hank. Gosh, there they go. There's one chute. Two to go. He's rolling over. Come on, guys. Get out of there. Bail out of there. Why don't they get out? Leepers, he's really spinning. Come on, you guys. Get out. Get out! There's one more out... 2 o'clock! They're coming in! They're coming under you, Ben. Hold your hats. I'm coming. Take 'em, Bill, take 'em! Look out! 5 o'clock! I'm coming up from 5! [Gunfire] How's our sweetheart, Mr. Holloway? Spurting oil like her heart's busted. Close the intercom. Watch out. Zero on your tail. Blue plate special coming up. Get him! Get him! [Gunfire] Sink, you... [Explosion] Goodbye, him. Nice work. Square in the belly. [Gunfire] Pilot to Radioman, are you all right? Mike, are you all right? I think that burst got him, Mr. Jacobson. Better bail out, Tommy. We haven't much time. Were you hit, Mike? Shut off your intercom, lacobson. I can't. My equipment's shot up. Mike, are you O. K? It's my leg, sir. Can you move them? Mike, can you move your legs? Uh-uh. We're burning back here. You'd better bail out, sir. I haven't got the altitude, Mike. We'll take this ride together. Lacobson, join up. Do you hear me, Hans? Loin up, I tell you. Enemy planes approaching. All hands stand by. Enemy planes approaching. Hard left! Hard left! Hard right rudder! [Bomb Whistling] The bomb that hit aft damaged the hydraulic lines that control the landing gear. How long to repair? Hard to say, sir. The returning planes will be low on gas. I want that gear operating by the time they're in sight. I want a report on damage and our maximum possible speed. The engine room reports we can only make 20 knots. We'll need 25 knots to land our planes. Report that below. Aye, aye, sir. Call out the after-damage control party. 20 men from the V-3 division. Clear that damage. Hurry it up! The flight deck offcer reports it's impossible to repair the after-flight deck in less than 45 minutes. You got just 20 minutes to repair that flight deck. When the planes return, they'll have a deck to land on. Sir, escort has picked up enemy submarine on the sound detector. We got a plane left to launch? One, sir. Just repaired. Launch her. Launch catapult bomber. Launch catapult bomber. Launch catapult bomber. Launch catapult bomber. Rapid gunners, hold your fre. Catapult plane being launched. We're going to be hit. Who was flying that plane? Ensign Cunningham, sir. That the one they call Cookie? Yes, sir. Sir, Torpedo Five and fghter escort returning. Prepare to land planes. Prepare to land planes. Code this to the other carriers... As soon as planes have landed, changing course 60 degrees southeast for cover of rain squall till repairs are completed. Aye, aye, sir. [Playing Reveille] Red, this is Molton. What now? Radar picked up disturbances at 85 miles, altitude 5,000 feet, but they've settled down to a single object. We can hear it now. Sounds like a TBF. You hear that, Molton? Could be a TBF. Any of yours straggling? Wait a minute. Oscar was just passing over the cargo when she blew up. Maybe... Scott is the only one not accounted for. Thanks, Red. Mr. Scott? You fgure the carrier ducked under that soup? Maybe. They weren't at the rendezvous. Keep your chin up. I'm not afraid of anything anymore, Mr. Scott. Today's my birthday. How old are you today, B. G? 17, sir. You hear that Benny? Hey, Benny. I'll get him down. Mr. Scott, couldn't we break radio silence long enough to get a fx? Nobody would like that better than I would, B.G. No dice. Brother, how I could use a spotlight now. That's Ensign Scott, sir. He doesn't know our new course. Couldn't we break radio silence? You don't have to give him a position theJaps can check. Just say, "We're right under you. Ceiling, 50 feet. Come on down." If you think theJaps have a radar fx on him, let me go up. I can lead him down. That's as useful to the enemy as breaking radio silence. We can't risk this carrier. What about that kid... That's enough, Molton. Check your casualty list and reform your squadron. Yes, sir. [Engine Faltering] [Plane Diving] [Crash] First it was Gus, then Brainard, then Chuck, and then Hans. But at least he had a fghting chance. But not Oscar. He didn't have a chance. Up there, going back and forth, and nobody made an effort to help him down. Do you know what these are? They're casualty lists. They're obituaries of a long list of friends of mine. Yes, friends. If I seemed too tough on the boys, it was because I was responsible for them. I didn't want to lose them any more than I wanted to lose those boys up there. You think I wanted to let Scott fly until he dove into the sea? You think I want to dream about them on a raft until their bodies rot? I'm an air offcer. There are things I can do and things I can't do. I can check casualty lists, and I can order more men into the air to become new casualties. I can refuse to endanger the lives of 3,000 men in order to save the lives of three men. I do those things because they're my job, and I've got to do them. But to be accused of refusing to save those men because I didn't want to save them... [Ringing] Torpedo Ready Room. Molton speaking. It's for you, sir. Yes. Very good. A destroyer picked up Scott and his crew. His radioman was lost, but he and his gunner are O.K. They got him! He's back in! How about that? He's back in the ballgame. Thanks, Ed. Period. Secure. How about that? Commander Harper. Orders for tomorrow... 14 TBFs, 19 SB2Cs...
