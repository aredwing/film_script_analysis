I hope you and Dad are too. Hey, it's me. I don't know if you've heard the news yet. I'm just at work. They're telling me not to leave. I don't know what to do. I just hope you get home safely. Hey, kiddo. It's your dad. I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. Just want you to know I'm thinking about you and I can't wait to give you a big hug. It's crazy, dude! Can you at least call back? I'm totally freaking out right now. I love you. I love you. I love you. You can survive this thing. Just get out of the city and stay away from the coast. I told you we were gonna fuckin' die from heat. We're totally gonna die. Please, can anybody hear me? Please respond. God, he loves you! This is VK6DF checking in for the first time today. Is there anybody out there? Over. Here it is, folks. It's happened. Approximate location of impact, the North Atlantic. Approximate time of impact at 7:30am Perth time... - ...which was... - Thy kingdom come. ...10 minutes ago. I just hope you're all keeping safe out there, you're surrounded by your families... Fuck off. ...friends, looking after each other. The eastern coastline of North America has been affected. Also the West African coastline. As of now, all of western Europe's gone. It's gone. As I speak to you right now... ...it's making its way towards our fair nation. Stop! Stop, please! It's not too late to change your mind. Be a great view from here. There's no shame in checking out ahead of time, folks. You gotta do what you gotta do. It's here. It's real. We're already fucking dead. It's gonna fucking hurt. And I don't want to feel it. I don't want to feel a thing. Just want to get fucked up. No. Go to your party. Fuck your girlfriend. You could forget about... all of this. We have 12 hours, people. That's all. - Go, go, go! Turn around! - Fuck! - What are you...? - Get on with your fuckin' day! Come on! Fuck me dead! - Take the fucking car. - Come on! Move it! - Go easy! - Come on! He burnt me! Idiots! Fuckin' foil! And they call me crazy. They'll be the first to go, down in their bunkers, waiting. Like fuckin' beef in a stew. Fuckin' beef in a crockpot. There's just no telling some people, is there? - I said, fuckin' is there?! - No, mate. There he is. Stop here! Stop, stop, stop! Give us the keys! Give us the fuckin' keys! Give us the fuckin' keys! I got some errands to take care of, alright? Like, I shouldn't be driving in my condition. You just fuckin' try me! You won't believe how fast I can run! - Shit! - Oi! What did I fuckin' say? Hey! Fuck me dead. Hey! Hey! Hey! - Hey, where are you going? - Piss off! Come here! Come on. Here, kitty, kitty. Hey! Hey, come here! Put me down! Please. I just want my dad. Let me go. Somebody help! Please, I just want my dad. Help me, please! Please help! Someone! - Somebody help me, please! - Shut up! I said, shut up in there! Give us some bloody peace and quiet. - Let me out! - Quiet! What are you talking about? I said shut up! Jesus Christ! We're not fucking around! Let me out! Please! Please let me out of here! Please! Let me out of here. Please! Let me out of here! - Let me out of here! - Hey! There's enough of her for both of us. Help! Help! It's OK. Let's get out of here. Get in the van. Hey! I don't know these men. I'm just taking their van. What? What? I want my dad. Listen! It's just not safe here! Get in the van! Please. Please. Please. They said they'd help me find Dad, but they... they went a different way. They said it was a short cut. He's 42. He's got black hair. - I need some water. - He was looking for some petrol. - Maybe you've seen him. - Shush! Can you just... Is there any water? There's this. You shouldn't drink and drive. It's dangerous. - Where do you live? - Dad burnt our house down. He said he didn't want anyone breaking in and living there. Oh, fuck. Said the house memories were our memories, no-one else's. - So he set it on fire. - Well... Where'd you last see your dad? When we ran out of petrol on the way to Aunty Janice's. Told me to hide while he found some more. No, there's gotta be somewhere I can leave ya. - Everyone's at Aunty Janice's. - Where's that? In Roleystone. No, no, no, no, no. Maybe Dad's back at the car, looking for me. In Malaga. Malaga? Yeah. You know where the ice rink is? Oi! Oi! Shut up! They're shooting again. Canada. Mexico. Central America. Gone. 10 hours, folks. Dad! - Over. - Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Fuck. - He's not here. - Dad! - Dad! - That's enough. - Dad! - Hey, it's enough. He's not here. He's not here. Fuck. Well, then... he must be at Aunty Janice's. He said if we ever got separated that we should meet there. Great. This is what he looks like. Where's your mum? She died. I've gotta get going. Well... maybe you could take me to my aunt's. I've got hardly enough petrol to get where I'm going. Well, there'll be petrol at my aunt's. My sister lives near here. You'll like her. She's nice. She has three little girls. You'll be safe there, alright? Come on. We're going. I need to be with my dad when it happens. Wait! I'm Rose. James. This is VK6DF checking in for the sixth time today. My mother, she said that, uh, science always had it over religion, and right up to this point, I always believed that. But I don't know. Funny how you can turn to God when you got no real faith in him. Stace! It's Jimmy! Stace! It's not Christmas. Why don't you go for a swim in the pool? - I'm gonna look upstairs. - But I don't have my bathers. - Just go in your dress. - Really? So where's your sister? She's not here. Where are you going? Party. Big party- Maybe someone at the party can take me to Aunty Janice's. How'd you find this place anyway? We used to come here when I was little. I feel safe here. Listen, Zo, I know you're for keeping your wits about you when it happens, but, fuck, you sure you won't take something? Like, something to take the edge off a little? Hey, come on, Zoe. You said... Hey. You said you wouldn't do that. Come on. It was... I just... - Oh... - Please. I just, um... What? I'm pregnant, James. You took a test or something? I wanted to know. I needed to be sure. I mean, what difference does it make? Ohh! What do you think, huh? A little boy or a little girl? Hey? I don't know. Boy. He would have been handsome, just like his dad. This is bullshit. Fuck. This is bullshit. You shouldn't have told me. - Where the fuck are my keys? - Stay here with me, James. Why? And stare out into the fucking ocean waiting for it? There's still time! What fucking difference does it make? We're already fucking dead! We're already fucking dead. It's gonna hurt a lot. And I don't want to feel it. I don't want to feel a thing. Hey. Life is stronger than death, James. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just want to get fucked up. You know, Dad says when it happens, the earth's gonna peel like an orange but the peel is made out of fire. Didn't sugar-coat it for you, did he? This'll stop the bleeding. You ever think you might end up in hell instead of heaven? That'd be awful. Sometimes I worry, though, I'm going to hell instead. Why do you think you might end up in hell? There was this girl in my class. She used to tease me all the time. One day last year, I prayed to God that she would die. She died just before this year's sports carnival. She'd gotten leukaemia. I don't think her getting cancer had anything to do with you. Or you praying to God. It just happens. Some people get sick and some people don't. But Dad always said that God has a perfect plan for everyone and that plan never fails. Well, if this was God's perfect plan, then he was a real fucking idiot. - I want to go home! - Come on, Jane. - Get out of the car. - Come on. - Come on. - Where are we going? Just grab your bag. - No! No! - Shh! Shh! - Oh, please, just listen. - Hey. - It's very important. - Excuse me. Excuse me. This girl's lost. Can I leave her with you? Gary, for God's sake. Get them out of here. Gary, please! - Can we go, James? - Yeah, come on. - Sorry. - Wait. Can I talk to you, just for a sec? - Please. - What? Please. Just sit down. OK. Just go read a book over there, Rose. What? What do you want? Hayley, please sit down. I've tried to do what's right. But I can't anymore. I love 'em too much. I can't watch 'em suffer like this. - What sort of dad would I be? - Hayley, get back here! - Dad! Dad! Dad! - Sweetheart, come back. Gary! You listen to Mummy, please. Could you do it? Clean, right in the back of their heads. - No. - Please! I've got a picture book. I'll read it to them. You just do it. Clean. Right in the back of their heads. They won't feel a thing, and then it'll be over. There's four bullets in there, one for each of us. - No. - Please. Please. No! Then forgive me, then. Forgive me... for what I gotta do. Say it. Say you forgive me. Say it. I forgive you. Rose? Come on. I hope you're looking after yourselves out there, and each other. These are the things we gotta hold onto. When it reaches us here in Perth, I know for a fact that I can sit here and go, "I had my faults, but... but I was a good man." Hello, Freddy? Oi, Freddy, it's James. - Who's that, man? - It's Jimmy. Open up the gate! Jimmy! Where you been, man? Vicky's mega-pissed, dude. Just open up the gate, will you, dickhead? - Is Vicky your girlfriend? - Yeah. Well, why is she mad at you? 'Cause I should have been here earlier! Bloody hell. Hey. Jimmy! Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot... Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot... Whom! Fuck yeah! Jimmy, you mad fuck! You look like shit, man. Bring it in, dickhead. - Where's Vicky? - Hey, man. Can you believe I thought no-one was gonna come to my party, man? Just look at these fuckers. They're just going off, man. They're just... You know what I mean? They're getting fucked. Oh! And they're just loving each other, man. They're just aiming life the way they want to have life! - Where's Vicky? - Who the fuck are you? Oi! Where's Vicky? Jesus! I don't know. Fuck! She's gotta be fuckin' somewhere. You should find her. She doesn't like being left alone. She's somewhere, man. You'd better fuckin' find her, man! - I know! - Oi! Oi. It's done. Downstairs. It's fuckin' done, and it's beautiful, Jim. You wait till you see it, man. Don't tell anybody. Just keep it on the down low. Just shh. Alright, huh? Fuck yeah! Hey, Jimmy! You made it. Nice one, bro! Whoo! James, I don't think anyone here will take me to Aunty Janice's. - It's me, baby. - Move. Where are you going? Um, is there anything to eat? Fuck! Here. Ah, Jimmy, bro, what you doing? Mandy? Hey, hey, it's me. It's Mummy. Hey, it's Mummy. Mandy, don't be scared. - It's Mummy. Mandy. - Oi, oi. - Oi! Her name's Rose, not Mandy. - No, it's my little Mandy. You want to be my little Mandy? I don't mind. - James! - Hey! Piss off. James, I don't like it here. Just eat your chips. How you been? I've been going crazy, out of my mind. This is Rose. She's looking for her dad. Oh! You brought a kid, James? Are you fuckin' serious? - I didn't plan for this. - We need to fuck now. Hey. Hi. How about you go and cool off in the pool whilst Uncle James and I go inside and we have a little chat, huh? - Go on! Don't be shy. Jump in. - Oi. Oi, Vic. Vic. - James. What? - James? Just... - Just go for a swim, alright? - But, James, what if... Rose, you'll be fine, OK? It's hot. Just get in. I never would have picked you for the fatherly type. I was so scared you weren't gonna make it. What's wrong? What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? Oops. What the fuck, James? Least you could do is make me come. Oi! Fuck, you can be a selfish prick. My sister's dead, Vic. She killed herself. She fuckin' killed herself. Her and Greg topped themselves, in the shower. And the girls. And the girls, I found 'em. They're gone. They're fucking gone. What's the matter with you? Did you hear what I said? Why'd you just tell me that? I mean, what's the point of knowing that? Huh? You're here now. Can't we just have a good fuckin' time? Selfish fuckin' prick. What the hell's the matter with you? Come on. Freddy says we have five, six hours max. Let's just make the most of it, OK? Have some. I'll tell you what, huh? Baby. Look. Listen. How about I give you a sneak peek? Hm? You're so beautiful. Oh, hey, look. Hey. You remind me so much of my little Mandy. I know how sad you're feeling right now, but I... I have just the thing for it. Whoo-hoo! It's easy. Ahh! See? Now it's your turn. You do. Now it's your turn. Will you take me to my aunt's place if I do? Uh... First things first. So pretty. Give me the torch. Pretty fuckin' cool, huh? Freddy made it all happen, just like he said. I want to cover every bit of cement with colour. It'll make a real difference, don't ya reckon? Freddy reckons there's enough supplies to last a year. So, what do you think of our new home? - Huh? - We're all dead, Vic. We're all dead. You, me, Freddy. Everyone. It's the fucking end. You need to be a fuckload deeper than this. A fuckload deeper. Thousands of kilometres deeper, just for a fucking start. And then what do you think? Things are just gonna fucking clear up and that we can just go back out, get on with fucking life - whoop-de-fucking-do - after a fucking year? Huh? Look around, Vic. I mean, just fucking look around. This is a fucking coffin, not a home. Why are you being so mean? Freddy said we could survive it down here. Freddy's offering us hope down here. Don't you want to be with me, down here? You went and saw her. You never even went and saw your family, did ya? Stop. This whole time, you were fuckin' her brains out by the beach. You could have stayed there. Bet you're fuckin' kicking yourself now. Hey. You think you're better than all of this? Better than me, hey? You're not. You're worthless. And you're a bad fuckin' liar. Fucking hate you! I fucking... Fuck you, ya fuckin' prick! Fuck you! I don't want to die! James! James, I'm so scared! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! - Stop, Vic. Stop. - I'm so scared, James. I'm sorry. I'm so scared. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Kiss me, James. - Stop, Vic. Stop. - Kiss me. - Vic, stop! Please. - Please, kiss me. - Please stop, Vic, Vic. - Kiss me! Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop, stop. Stop. - Kiss me. - Please stop. Stop. - Please. Kiss me. - Please stop. I'm scared. I'm scared too. I'm scared. Yeah. Yeah. Stop. Just listen to me. I came here because I didn't know what to think. I didn't know what to do. Just wanted to block it out and get fucked up. I can't. I can't block it out. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna take that girl back to her dad. - No. - It's where she belongs. What about you, though? Where do you belong? Not here. I'm sorry. Vic, I'm sorry. Vic. If you leave, I'll kill you. - Vic. - And then I'll kill myself. Oh! Jesus Christ, Vic! What are you doing? Huh? You knew I wanted to show Jimmy this place myself. And you had to fuckin' do it, didn't ya? Why are you crying? Why is she crying, Jim? What's going on? What did I miss? Why is she crying? Jim? Talk to me, dickhead. Why the fuck is she crying? Stop fucking telling her these crazy stories of survival! It's not right! She's your fuckin' sister! Stop telling her everything's gonna be OK! - It is gonna be OK! - It's not! - You shut the fuck up. - You don't belong down here. - What are you talking about? - You don't belong down here. Oi! - What's he been saying, darling? - We're not deep enough. We're all gonna die. You fuckin' killjoy! You fuckin' get back here, Jim! Rose! Rose! - Hey, Jimmy, man. - Rose! Rose! Rose! - What'd you do to her? - Never mind. She's mine. - Mandy! - Her name's not Mandy! It's Rose! What's wrong? She's burning up. What'd you give to her? - Nothing! - What'd you fuckin' give to her? - What did you give to her? - I didn't give her anything! - Sorry, Rose. - Mandy! Her name's Rose! It's not Mandy! He's got my daughter! - He's got my daughter! - Fuck off! Not cool, man. Alright? Not cool. Not cool! Not cool, Jimmy! Just trying to have a good time and you spoil it, man. OK? You can't push women like that. Alright? You fuckin' killjoy. You fuckin' ungrateful fuck! She's not good. She's not good. Just let us leave. - No! He's got my Mandy! - Oi! Fuck off! - I want my Mandy! - Put her fucking down! Her name's Rose! - Put her fucking down! - She's fuckin' crazy. Look at her. She's off her fuckin' dial! - I'm not putting her down. - Yes, you fuckin' are. - Just shoot him! - I'm not putting her down! Just shoot him! Just shoot him! - Fuck, man. - I'm not putting her down. I've got a bullet for your head if you don't put her down. - Give me the gun, Freddy. - Vicky, what are you doing? You're embarrassing me in front of everybody. - Just shoot him! - Don't do that. Shoot him! Just fuckin' shoot him! Vicky, please. - Just fucking shoot him! - Vic! Just fucking shoot him! Fuck, yeah, bitches! Go. No! No, no, no! No! No! - No! - Dad... - Fuck! - My skin's hot. Come on. Drink. Drink. ..Tiger land In any weather, we will see us with a grin... Hold tight, Rose. Hold tight. When we're behind, we don't mind We are gonna win We're from Tiger land The fighting fury, Tiger land And if you see us... Oi, oi! Eh! Fuckin'... Eh! Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate! Fuck's sake! Get back here! Hold on. Hold on, Rose. Mum! It's Jimmy, Mum! It's OK, Rose. Mum, it's Jimmy! Mum! I've got a little girl! She needs help! Mum, she's burning up! Please! Mum, come on! Don't kick the fuckin' door! OK, Rose. OK. Here. Thanks. You little prick. There's no way you were coming back. And now here you are, just like that. - I was. - Oh, yeah. I was, alright? I wondered what I'd say to you if you did somehow magically appear. It's funny, you know, I... I don't feel sad, happy. Just numb inside. I was gonna swing by, Mum. What do you want me to say, huh? Do you think I planned for this? Huh? - Can I bum a demon? - Knock yourself out. You seen your sister, by any chance? No. Well, I went round there yesterday. Had some chocolates for the girls. I knocked, waited, no answer. Called out, like an idiot. No-one came to the door. Not even the girls. Oh, so selfish. I don't have rights to see my own grandkids. It's that husband of hers. He's driven a wedge. - Didn't you go inside? - You even listening? No-one came to the door. I could tell that they were at home. Well, I did go around today. - Thought you said you didn't. - Well, I did. I wanted to use the car. So I went inside. There was a note on the coffee table saying they'd gone. Packed up and left. Gone? Gone where? Didn't say, alright? Just said they'd gone. Explains why no-one went to the fuckin' front door. I mean, at least they're all together, right? Oh... who'd want to live in a world where you can't even say goodbye to your grandkids? Sometimes, I swear, the end can't come soon enough. How much petrol you got in the Laser, Mum? - You are unbelievable. - How much? Who you trying to impress? Running around, trying to help this girl. I'm just trying to help her, Mum. If you can't understand that, then that's your problem. Well, maybe I can't understand. I'm just your stupid mother. What would I know? What would I know about you? - It's gone. Someone pinched it. - When? Does it matter? You stubborn old bat. Try the shed. There's a couple of Jerry cans floating round in there. Fuck. Mick down the street, he never came back for 'em once his shed was done. He won't be comin' back for 'em. He went bush, like a lot of those nut jobs. Like that's gonna make a bloody difference. How about you, Mum? What are you gonna do? When it happens. You got anything planned? Got a few puzzles I'll try and get finished. Puzzles? Yeah. Good girl. Yeah. There you go. Good? Yeah? OK? We're gonna see Dad. You know what pisses me off the most, James? I already did this. I already said goodbye to you a number of times. More than once. And you had to turn up for real. Sorry, Mum. Don't be. It's a good thing what you're doing for her. You better go. Go on. Good luck with the puzzle, Mum. South-East Asia's gone. All of it's gone. My brother Steve's in Thailand. Steve-O. I'm glad we got to have that chat before the phones went down. Hope you were somewhere beautiful, bro. Over. Sorry, James. What for? That woman said she'd take me to Aunty Janice's. I shouldn't have listened to her. I keep getting you into trouble. No, no, no. Don't be silly. Alright? It's over now. Don't be upset, alright? You don't want your dad to see you upset, do you? - No. - No. You're a tough chick. - Say it. - I'm a tough chick. - I didn't hear you. - I'm a tough chick. - I don't believe you. - I'm a tough chick! What happened to your girlfriend? Things didn't work out. You broke up? Yeah. She was pretty but not... that pretty. - Yeah? - Yeah. She was weird. Thought you'd have had a much nicer girlfriend than that. Come on, James. Everyone's here! Dad! Dad, I'm here! Dad, it's me! Dad! I'm here! Come on, guys, it's me! Aunty Janice! It's me! I'm here! Dad! Where are you, Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad, it's me! Dad! Dad? Dad! Dad? - Hello? - Dad! Maybe they're over at the pond. Dad! Hello! Hello? Dad? - Aunty Janice! - Hello! Dad! James? - Rose! - James. - They're not here. - You OK? - They're not anywhere. - Stop. Did you find anyone? Um... - Rose, you can't go over there. - Let me get past! Rose, please. Please. Come on. Why not? Why not? You can't go down there 'cause they're... ...dead. - Dad! Dad! - Hey! Hey! Rose! Rose! You can't! You don't know what he looks like! - Please, I need to see him. - He's there, Rose. Stop! Put me down! Put me down, please! - Put me down! - Hey, sit. - Sit down. - Please! I'm sorry. Rose. Rose! I need to see him. I need to make sure. OK. I'm sorry, Dad. I love you. - Rose? Rose. - No! - Now, come on. - No. I don't want to go. - Rose, he's dead. - I'm not leaving him. - Come on. - No! Come on, Rose. Come on. Let's go. - No, don't. - Come on. Let's go. Arggh! What? Dad wanted us to be together when it happened. This is where I need to be, James. With Dad. I'm sorry. I wish you could have met my dad. It was in your dad's pocket. I remember this day. It was her birthday. Dad got the waiters to sing 'Happy Birthday' to her. She looked really embarrassed, but I think she secretly liked it. You know, I'd have been a dad, Rose. Was that woman at the party pregnant? Not her. Someone else. Is she prettier than the other one? Yeah. Then how come you're not with her? 'Cause I messed things up. I've messed a lot of things up, Rose. What did you do? I left her all alone. There's still time. OK. Sorry I bit you. It's OK. See ya. See ya. James. I'm gonna watch you until I can't see you anymore. Can you watch me too? Until you can't see me? Sure. Ladies and gents, I'm sure you can all hear that rumble in the air. We've got just under an hour. I just... ...just don't know what to say. I'm trying to think of something poetic. It's coming. It's coming. No! No! No, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! Maybe it's nothing more than hope. Or maybe we'll see each other again. Well, wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that be something? Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe. Zoe! I'm here. - Don't you touch me. - I'm here. - Don't you fucking touch me! - Zoe! - I'm sorry. Zoe! - You left me alone! I'm sorry. Zoe. I'm sorry. - You left me! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm here! I love you so much. I'm sorry. I'm here. I love you so much. I love you. - I love you. - I love you. It's beautiful.
