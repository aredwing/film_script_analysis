Is it true that you saw the suspect? I'm not sure. - Tell me what happened. I was dancing and I bumped into this woman. Then the couple fell. - Describe the woman. Who is she? - Annika... I'm trying to perform my job. They're waiting for my copy. My God, do you have any idea! Two people were shot right where you stood. Tell exactly what you saw right now, - I was dancing. - With who? I don't know. We'd only just met. There were a lot of people. I was dancing and a woman bumped into me. Describe her Tell me about her clothes. The dress had straps. She had a hand bag. Her hand was inside it. Her eyes. She looked at me. Her eyes were yellow. Completely golden. Golden yellow? - Yes. Did you hear anything? Only murmurings. Murmurings. - Suppressed voices. Pops. I turned around. On the floor lay a woman. She looked at me. She tried to say something. It was strange. Then I noticed blood spreading across the floor. Then... a woman was killed. Anything else? - No. All right. Who was the woman? Put them away. - You can not identify the victims. - Who was with Wiesel? - Caroline von Behring. Karolinska Institute, The Nobel committee chairman. What about Wiesel? - Still in the operating theatre. What facts are known? The killer was a woman wearing a gold dress.. Were any threats made? - The winners always get threatened. Any particular threat? Stem cell research is always opposed. Stop it. This is an absolute waste of time. You will not be able to write about this. - Why not? You are the key witness. The ban applies to the words. The ban relates to the imprisonment. No one has been arrested. The ban applies to you, Article 23 Chapter 10 expressions of prohibition may be imposed committed a serious criminal offense. At last. - Where are you? Tell me something. - I've been banned from talking. National Bureau of Investigation to be exact. The police can't do this... - Ask for help Schymanilta. I'll call him. Yes, he'll sort it. Come as soon as you can. Bengtzon! Pictures. You want pictures. I've got shaking hands with the Ministry of Culture. I want a bit of blood. - Let's see if I can help. Let's go. - I'll get my coat. I'll get it. Jacket and a brown handbag. - Wait here. Entry to this area is forbidden. - I'm sorry. I got lost. Is this your bag? You're welcome. Shall we go? news is still awaited of the injury to the award-winning scientist Wiesel. Aaron Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Prize for his stem cell cloning research. The study has been criticized, and his life has been threatened. Now came on. Come take a look. That's it. Good! Well done. Get back here. Bengtzon! - Where it Schyman? He is speaking to lawyers. It'll make a double spread. May I write? - Of course. It's all sorted. The guard died in the hospital, so there are now two victims. "Reporter witness to a double-murder. " Schyman will. The police let killer escape - and then try to hide details of the death. What did they say? - No way. Annika can not write. - But... You will not give interviews or talk about what you've seen. This is an... That's the deal. - I'm sorry. Hell. Is there no way? Sorry. Let's get moving. Cover it Patrick. "Shooting at the Nobel ceremony. " Photos of the victims. Taken care of. - Search for more information. You can't anything, Annika. Go home and rest. I choose the Christmas tree. - Now it's my turn. When are we going to buy the Christmas tree? Yeah. - I need to get a Christmas tree? Yeah... How you holding up? - Pretty good. I didn't realize how upset you were. I just wanted to sleep. Do not worry. Good morning, sweetie. Cutie. Did you get the strawberry yogurt. What a treat. Brush your teeth, you'll be late. Bye, Mom. It should be pink. The Christmas tree. - It will be the world's finest. Father's waiting to take you to school. ... a German New Jihad terrorist group. Have claimed responsibility for the attack at the Nobel Prize Presentation. Where the Israeli Nobel Prize laureate Aaron Wiesel was wounded, - and one of the Nobel Committee member was killed. ... a man has been arrested, and is being interrogated this afternoon. THREE KILLED AT NOBEL AWARDS Welcome. Right there. Good job. We know more about the victims and our pictures are better. We should be very pleased. In particular, with what Bengtzon was able to provide. I did not get credited, thank you. - You didn't. Sorry. OK, I want a team of five journalists. Status: New Jihad, sacrifices, factor, police work and the witnesses. OK, international terrorism includes all aspects. Emphasis to be put on police incompetence. How can an armed assassin gatecrash such an important event? How about this? "Terror at the City Hall. " Aaron Wiesel. - St. Gran's Hospital. Condition is stable, will soon return home. - Get good pictures. What about the guards? - One died. That will be tricky. Security officers families do not give interviews. What do the police say? - That they're on full alert. Blockades erected quickly. The fourth spread: "Murderer hunted down. " Woman's escape boat was found. She is believed to have fled by car towards the south. What about the police sketch? - The police will not publish it. What is known from the Neue Jihad? It has links with al-Qaeda - which is unlikely to be pro- Jewish. Good, Patrik. Write about Al-Qaida and terrorism. Berit, call relatives. Nslund write about the hunt for the killer. Annika helps Patrik back at work. You 're banned from writing, while you work. Let's get going. I dont believe a word about the New Jihad. Too many things do not add up. No smoking for two days. What don't you believe? - New Jihad. Al-Qaeda would have made sure that they killed Wiesel. - What do you mean? - It was an invitation only concert... A hit man shoots from only a couple of feet away and misses? Perhaps the target was Caroline von Behring. Why would someone murder Caroline von Behring? It sounds far-fetched. Von Behringhn died. What do we know about him? Let me talk with the Director of Entertainment. We need you here. Why? All of our resources must be now focus on this story. Only for the duration of the ban. You may not be happy as a News Editor, but you need a job. Let's do it. Well done. Caroline von Behring? Why do an article about her? It is very timely, it must be said. - And after all, she was killed. She was a woman. An unknown force in the Nobel-environment. Exactly. Unknown. She died during the Nobel Festival, while she was dancing in the Golden Hall. Are you thinking of Princess Diana? "Nobel secret princess. " Yes, exactly. But I would need to do research on it. Talk with people who knew her. - Yes, maybe a younger lover. Something wonderful... I am thinking out loud. - What about pictures? - Yes. Find some that show happiness. While she was alive, I mean. - It'll be fine. Yes. When can you deliver? Annika Bengtzon, Kvllspressen. I'm looking for someone who will speak on Caroline von Behring. Okay, thanks. Annika Bengtzon, Kvllspressen. I want to talk with Professor von Behring's secretary. When was von Behring elected to the committee? May I speak to someone on the committee? Can I get names of her colleagues? Thank you. Her assistant... She worked closely along with Caroline. Brown hair, glasses. She works at the Department of Physiology and Biophysics. Where is she now? I have met her. Do you mean Bridget Larsen? - Yes, exactly. Excuse me? Yes? - I come from Kvllspressen. I have a meeting with Bridget Larsen. Do you know where she is? Upstairs. I'll show you. Thank you. You're welcome. Yes? This is... - Annika Bengtzon, Kvllspressen. That's right. - We talked on the phone. You want to talk to me about Caroline? - Yes. This is Johan Isakson, one of my PhD - Students. Thank you for your help. - You can go now. You're welcome. As I said, I am working on an article about Caroline von Behring. We became doctors simultaneously. Two women in the same month. It was pretty unusual back then. It's 25 years ago. And she had some success, right? - Success? You can certainly say that. How was she as a person? - Caroline lived for her work. And she conducted research in biophysics? - Yes. The antibody gene. A further development of Tonegawas discovery.. How do you spell that? Spelled it as it sounds. T- cell receptors, if you know what they are. How did Caroline react when Wiesel got the credit? It was she who supported him to be the winner.. She knew it would cause trouble. She was controversial? - Yes. Courageous. Perhaps a little overconfident. Do you think it was an accident? Caroline was just at the wrong place at the wrong time? What are you saying? Could Caroline have been target of the attack, and not Wiesel? He survived, yes, and she... - What are you insinuating? She died yesterday, and so you come here... You must go now. You must excuse me. - Do you hear what I say? Go now. MUIZNIEKI LATVIA Sorry. I cannot put you out. Just do it. Are you working late? No, I just want to find out more about Caroline von Behring. She was in charge and helped to select the Laureate candidates. She was not exactly popular. Are you OK? Yes, there is a good time what with secret networks, terrorist cells. We're still pursuing the New Jihad track. The good old dread of Islam. See you tomorrow. I did not know journalists worked so late. I've got to put the hours in, to keep my job. How are you? Is everything okay? - Yes. Did you know her? - Yes, a hundred years ago. She was my supervisor, When I wrote the thesis. Really...? Immune system. Signal paths, interleukins. And what about you? What are you working with? Journalism. - Sorry. I took for granted that you were a scientist or doctor. No, I'm not even a health journalist. Annika Bengtzon. - Bernhard Thorell. Kvllspressen. - Medi-Tec. You must excuse me. Hi... How are you, Bridget? Well thank you. In the circumstances, so... Welcome to this press conference, where we gather with sorrow in our hearts. I'm talking about the terrorist attack on Aaron Wiesel - - So tragic and... pointless killed our President Caroline von Behring life. The selection process for next year's Prize is already underway - and we hope soon to present the new president. Committee's work led by Caroline von Behring, - - Will continue in the direction she had set out. Yes, and in Alfred Nobel's Testament direction - you should probably add. Nobel's will is inviolable - and yet crime is committed against it repeatedly. Caroline von Behring was an avid proponent - for the controversial stem cell research. But under new management, we can see confidently into the future. How dare you? You should be ashamed of yourself. The mad professor? She sounds pretty refreshing. They are all in a a little mad in the head. I do not know. It's hard to get an overview of what they stand for. Whatever one thinks, the fact remains. She was Doctor with Caroline, but it was 25 years ago. Go down in the paper file and see if you can find something there. I know what happened at the Nobel celebration. It's okay. Nobody can hear us in here. I was a marshal at the party. Some weeks before I got an offer to earn a little extra. It was a practical joke. MARSHAL FOR NOBEL CELEBRATION. I had to watch online - And send a text message on where the person was. Who were you watching? Who were you to send an SMS to? Her supervisor Bridget Larsen - She is involved in this? I want 10,000 kroner. We do not pay for information especially not from accomplices. I'm not an accomplice. I had no idea what would happen. Do you know what I got for this task? 1.000 kroner. be suspected as an accomplice to murder. Why did you not go to the police? - I want to tell my story here first. They might not believe me. Have you any evidence? Your mobile? No, I threw it away right after. I was in a total panic. You want to sell us a story but what do you really have? It was her. NOBEL HEAD SHOT! It was her, I had to watch Caroline von Behring. Is he trustworthy? - Yes. Have you read the newspapers today? All about Aaron Wiesel and controversial stem cell research. I know. And you think they are wrong? And you believe him? - Yes, I do. What do we know about him? That he'll go to some other paper if we do not print. Can you hold onto him until tomorrow? We have to check him. Fine. Say we are interested. you can interview him, but Berit to write. Okay, that's a deal but we must meet again tomorrow. When in the morning? - As early as possible. But it is the best offer you get. Yes, but it's my story, I must tell it. No editing-shit. Yes, it is your story. Fine. Call me on this number tomorrow. Otherwise I will go to someone else. Hey. I've been looking for you. What then? - Things are going fine. I saw pictures of von Behring. Beautiful lady. Just as you said. You get a double spread. - Double? Can you get them ready for next week? Of course. - Great. You look good in beige. - Thank you. Come here, Jesper. Stop it. Benjamin! Kalle-Bale, move yourself. - Benjamin, come on. Annika? Mary Douglas. We're neighbors. We just moved into. That's right. Hey. You're coming to us for mulled wine. - For what? I talked with your husband. Let's go home, Benjamin. No, you can come back later! When would it be? Donald? Hello, sweetheart. It's just mulled wine with the new neighbors. It will be nice. You could have asked me. She seems really nice. - Do you think so? Yes. Apparently he works in the ministry. I don't want to drink mulled wine. And their son teases Kalle. How do you know? I can see he is upset. What says Kalle? Nothing. That everything is okay. then everything is probably okay. We have to trust what he says. It will become just worse, if we intervene. Need help? I got scared. How do you turn this off? Sorry. Open the door! Stop it. If the guy's story holds water, we've got a hell of a scoop. Please do not destroy your career. Or, mine. Hello? - Hello? Is that Johan Isakson? No, it's not. - Do you know where he is? Yes, I do. Who am I talking to? - It's Annika Bengtzon. how the hell did you get this number? He came to us first. It was his choice. So you have no responsibility? You could have said no. Then he would have gone to someone else. - Maybe they would have said no. If you had any sense of responsibility Instead of thinking purely of circulation, - Then perhaps he would have come to us, and perhaps he would still be alive. You know how he died? - We have a good idea. I was sworn to secrecy and I have not broken it. Even if you dont believe it. I will not disclose information. Johan Isaacson's death was an accident. Is that understood? It is. This will remain within these walls. Otherwise, the whole investigation at risk. After all, it is clear. Isakson sent a text message to Riga. He was trying to blackmail someone. - It seems so. Two men were murdered in a basement, a little outside of Riga. We found them yesterday. We believe at least one of them was involved in the escape from City Hall. And the killer? - Rent a murderer based in USA. CIA called her Kitten. Kitten. Kitten. The eyes. - Yes. Your testimony led the CIA. On the trail. Annika, you are now a key witness. She may not know we're on track so none of it has to come out. Is that why I'm sworn to silence? We must first find out who ordered the murder. I have an appointment with Ernst Ericsson. Nobel's will is inviolable - - Yet crime is committed against it repeatedly. ANDRIETTA AND ALFRED NOBEL Annika Bengtzon? - Yes. Ernst Ericsson. - Hello. It is Wonderful that Kvllspressen are so interested in committee work. We have not met before. Are you a new health journalist? Actually I'm a crime reporter, but I'm writing about Caroline von Behring. Really. Then I must have misunderstood something. No, but I did not work with her on the committee? Well... Caroline. She was married to von Behring. She kept his name after the divorce. Her maiden name was Andersson. But that name evoked no response in the medical world. She wants people to believe she was related to the old family. With? - Nobel Prize winner Emil von Behring. He invented the serum and vaccine. - How was she as a boss? She was not qualified to hold the post. - How? She would never have been President, if she had not been a woman. It was political correctness. Women do not need skill or Credit to get ahead in the world. And who benefits from it? Certainly not research, at least. Caroline and you disagreed on interpretation of the will, right? Nobel created with his will not just a small prize - - He built a triumphal arch for humanity. At the press conference you said Caroline had sinned against his will. - I have nothing more to say. - But you were talking about a new leadership. Did you mean yourself? - Unfortunately, I have a meeting now. Is there another candidate for the presidency? Ernst Ericsson with c and two s's. And Sren Hammarsten. - Okay. And the Karolinska Institute Nobel Committee? I'll see what I can find. - Thank you. Everybody has been looking for an external enemy. It was a natural assumption. That it. Should be a terrorist group or religious fanatics. But? I think it's an internal conflict within the Nobel Committee. The police know who the murderer is. She is an American assassin and her goal was not Aaron Wiesel. It was Caroline von Behring. A contract killing. What if it was someone from the committee, who ordered the murder? We must redouble our efforts. Check out this angle. Get it delivered to the Newsroom. - It's almost finished. What I say to Spiken? - Nothing. You talking to me. Here. Here you go. - Already? But did not we? Yes, but it is finished. "The story of a strong woman's life and death. She moved effortlessly... Uncomplicated and with a strong sense of justice. And the young man by her side... " Really good start. Strong. - Pictures are available on the server. We must first identify the person who ordered the murder. What do you know about him besides he have access to much money? If it is a Him. Do you think it was an accident? - What do you think? I know what happened to the Nobel celebration. Thanks for this. I know you are busy. I heard about your PhD student. - Yes. Terrible story. A door was jammed. such a young, talented man. The first time we met, you asked - - If Caroline could be the target. Why did you think that? Caroline... Caroline looked at me, When she died, - - And it was as if she would tell me something. As if she knew something. - Something she wanted to tell me. It was me, she confided in. But she said nothing, you heard? Or maybe you heard, but did not understand? No, nothing. Caroline had a different view of Nobel's will. She thought we should interpret it from a contemporary viewpoint. Although she had the committee against her? She felt that Nobel would have been on her side. He was like her. a Visionary. Not an old, dusty male. There are many Ernst Ericsson "in the Nobel-environment. And then there are people who are slightly more progressive. Also on the committee? Who for example? Soren Hammarsten. He would be a good President He has a feel for future research. He understands what we're doing. Will he not take over then? He's acting chairman. Not if you believe the rumors. What do they say? - That it is Ernst Ericsson. He has been right... ...recklessly pushing himself forward in recent years. And, the chair is one of the most powerful positions in academia. If you want to write about the power struggle in the committee, - - It's fine To begin with Ernst. May I ask something? How well do you know Bridget Larsen? - Not particularly well. I have met her in connection with a research grant. But she and Caroline were close friends. - Yes. What do you think? I think if she knew anything about Caroline, she would say. But I do not know. Thank you for allowing me to disturb you. - It was nice. Before you go! Would you like to meet again? For a cup of coffee or a glass of wine or something. That wouldn't be a good idea I'm married. Or we live together. - Sorry. I didn't mean to push. No, it's totally okay. You have 14 new messages. It's Lotte from the school center. Kalle has fallen and hurt herself. She might need stitches. Can you call me. Hey, it's me. Kalle has hurt herself. I'm on my way to the emergency room. Where are you? I'm in the emergency department, and Kalle s being X-rayed. Annika, where the hell are you? Kalle needs stitches. Call me. Now! Hello, sweetheart. How are you? Hey. Annika, Kalle's mother. Much obliged. How are you? They put stitches in my head. What happened? - He fell off a climbing frame. They were stupid. Who? What happened? I did not fall. Benjamin pushed me. Deliberately? Come, we'll take you home. The Youth center said it was an accident. These things happen. Do you believe them rather than your own son? We must believe what Kalle says. We do not want to have a conflict with such nice neighbors. The Youth center know how to deal with such matters. What do you mean by "such matters"? It's damn serious, it is here. He could be dead. Have you talked to the parents? I talked to Mary. She thinks Benjamin didn't meant anything by it. So you will not do anything? - I didn't say that. But no one saw what happened. - Kalle just fell down. And if nobody does anything you can be sure that it will happen again. Stop it! It was me that had to deal with it! What the hell? ' - LortemI! What are you doing? Stop it there. - What? Listen. I'll tell you one thing. If you just once, just one single time - - Do something against Kalle again - - so I'll kill you. "She went straight naturally in boardroom, in associations - and among friends. Uncomplicated and spontaneous and with a strong sense of justice. " You could get a job at Vanity Fair. - Rather too ladies. I think it's good. - Do you? Thank you. STORY OF A STRONG WOMAN LIFE AND DEATH Have you got a cold? - No. I've just had a smoke. That nicotine gum was useless - - so now I have gone over to something stronger. Not everyone is happy about it. Listen. "You have a responsibility to the truth, you have failed. Caroline had secrets. She was playing a dirty game. It did not go unpunished. " Who sent it? - It was anonymous. Anonymous. Then they are cowards. Caroline Andersson. Andersson. Did you check her with the Nobel Committee? - Yes. Where are Ernst Ericsson? - Ernst Ericsson. Here. It is not because he needs the money, that he wants the Presidency. Toro, is that his home address? - Yes. Well it should be. Can you see who sent it here? - I can try. Thank you. Nobel House. - I would like to speak to Ernst Ericsson? He is not here. He's working from home today. Could I have his mobile number. Ernst Ericsson. - Annika Bengtzon, Kvllspressen. I got an email regarding my article on Caroline von Behring. We will give you the opportunity to comment on it. I do not know what you're talking about. I have no comment. Thank you. Hallo? Hallo? Ernst? Hallo? I thought we had a deal. I have not written anything. Go home. We will call, if we want something. What will you publish? - Nothing. We must first notify his relatives. And when you have done that? Three dead in Nobel environment in three days. You gotta have a theory. Could it be the Kitten? What do you think? If Ernst Ericsson ordered the murder, she might kill him. No, I think not. It was not a professional murder. Where are you going? - Back to the newspaper. I no longer am bound by the confidentiality clause. I wrote nothing for fear of warning Kitten, but now it's not her. I forbid you to do. - So shoot me. It's Bernard Thorell on Medi-Tec. Please leave a message. Hey, it's Annika. I have some more questions for you about the committee. It's about Sren Hammarsten and his position. Will you call me, When you get this? ...you failed to tell the truth, Andersson had secrets. It is a question about human dignity and ethics. It is not the right place for that discussion. I want to thank everyone who has helped to give me this honor. Mom, we're home! Hi, cute cubs Hello, Pusling. Hey. Mom, you know what happened today? Benjamin had to go home - - Because he peed in his pants. Go out and play. Hey. What is it? Did you tell Benjamin, that you would kill him? Who said that? - Maria, Benjamin's mother. She was pretty upset. Nobody would do anything. So you are threatening an eight year-old? Someone had to say something. You wouldn't do anything. You're bloody crazy. I am ashamed of you. Go over and say sorry. Not now. BE AT WORK To be announced Hey. - Hello. Fine, you could meet me so late. I did not know if you wanted red or white. I really prefer beer. - I thought so. Incidentally, have you a pen I can borrow? - Yes. Much obliged. SkI. I have known Hammarsten six or seven years. He has no ambition for power. But he is the obvious candidate. - He is the best candidate. But it is the scientists who want him. It is not Sren himself. But the conflict between Hammarsten and Ericsson seems quite personal. Yes, but mostly from Ernst's side. He can be rather inflexible. You must have noticed. - What do you think? Last time we met, I had a feeling that you wanted to talk to him again. Yes, but I couldn't get hold of him. You... I was glad you called. I was thinking of you. I've thought of you ever since the party. Yes, I remember that evening. Where were you? I was looking for you. I had to stay and talk with the police. But you did well. You saw her, didn't you? Who? It does not matter. Did you see her? The girl with the gun? No, it does not matter. Yes... It's getting late. I'd better go now. I. Pay. - Thank you. And thanks for your time. INFORMATION FROM CONTACT IN SWEDEN YOU'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED Eyewitness: Annika BENGTZON Hey. I have traced the anonymous mail. - Yes? It was sent from Karolinska server. Here is the name. Bridget Larsen. - Thank you. i should have revealed Caroline's secret - - But I didn't want to get involved. I thought it was over, but now... Someone broke into my laboratory. They left it here. A photo of Caroline from a congress in Helsinki in the 90s. I don't understand. Caroline's big breakthrough as a researcher came with an article in Science Magazine. but the magazine would have verified the results. They're fairly routine checks. However, Caroline simply went to the Congress. So she cheated? How you do not say it. It was a routine check. And it was not her who fabricated the results. It was me. I helped her fill them in and send them to Science Magazine. But someone found out? - Yes. One of her Ph. D. students. Bernhard Thorell. He broke into my laboratory. - to keep my silence. Did it succeed? Caroline felt that someone threatened her up at the party. But she did not say who. She said that if they found her; I could find everything in her file. I've told this to the police - - But they found nothing. Fint. How'd it go? We have interrogated him but in addition to Larsen's review - - There is nothing that links him to the murder of Hall. Then you released him? - He is still a suspect. We just can not hold him. - Caroline von Behring archive. We've been looking for it, but found nothing. - Thank you. - It was so little. Do you know what a Nobel prize is worth for a company like Medi-Tec? The mention? Recognition? At least 50 billion dollars. I've tried everything - - But I have not found anything. But it must of course be here. - In itself, yes. What about the computer? - We can check. And on the web? - I do not know. How? I keep things on the web. She probably had a webmail. Okay. It's just the temperature in the test cabinet. The alarms are so sensitive. I'll be right back. Andersson. Fandens. Andrietta. My name is Caroline von Behring. What I will tell you as one of my old PhD students. I've never told this before, but I have to now. For he has returned, and this time he will want more. Hi, Bridget. The first time I succumbed. I approved his thesis. Even though I knew it did not hold water. He has contacted me again. He wants the Nobel Prize. It is easy. Drag your review back, so there is no more. No. I will not do it. No. No, close to that. I must keep his researchers were as Nobel laureates in medicine. My answer was simple. I said no. Should we continue with the rabbits? - No, stop. I pray you. Will not you quit? He has given me an ultimatum. If his research is not among winners, so I'm dead. Hello? Bridget? Yes? I have found the archive and she mentions a name. Annika, I'm coming right away. Hey, it's Annika. I'm on Karolinska with Bridget - - and I send you a file. Look at it as soon as you get it. It comes out in the newspaper tomorrow. Come and see this. Gladly. What will you show me? - No, no. What is this? Bernhard says - - That if his scientists are not among the winners, so I'm dead. DELETE? You can not ruin it now, You, little... Annika! Annika! He has given me an ultimatum. About three weeks publish... If his scientists are not among the winners, so I'm dead. Damn. Off to Karolinska. In here. Run in here. Stop! Bernhard Thorell! Get out of the car. Stop! Stop, I say! Bernhard Thorell is suspected of having hired a hitman. Discovered by journalist Annika Bengtzon... ...Caroline von Behring during the Nobel ceremony on 10th December. Thorell must have blackmailed von Behring to give the Nobel Prize... Police suspect Thorell for the murder of Nobel President. Hitman is on the run. Okay, we go up to eight pages now. We make the front page about. Good job, Bengtzon. - See here. - Mother, look here. Mom, look. There we have it, yes. - It's pink. There we go.
