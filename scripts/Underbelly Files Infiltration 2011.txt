They arrived in Australia early last century and established a power base in the farming country of New South Wales because that's what they were - peasant farmers. They grew fruit and vegies. alright. But that wasn't their only cash crop. When marijuana came along. They coudn't believe their luck. They went into the dope business big-time and made a fortune and like Mafia back home in Italy. They protected their pot of gold with tooth and claw. I swear, I didn't do it. Didn't we pay you enough? Plenty. I never took the stuff. Just tell the truth. You stole from the crop we pay you to look after. You're gonna knock me anyway. Just tell me the truth. And you won't knock me? There is a chance. I pinched 100 plants. You've got hundreds of thousands out here. Listen, I sold them, but I'll get them back to you, OK? It's not a problem. I got a bit now, and I'll give you a bit... No, please! I told the truth. I told the truth. Yes, you did. And you will go to heaven... Arggh! Ohh! ...with a limp. And when God says, "Why do you limp?" You tell him the truth too - you thieved. No, Antonio...! Over the years. They notched up dozens of violent murders. Police coudn't ignore them forever. But how do you crack open an organisation like the Mafia? They're a family. They don't trust outsiders. They never talk business on the phone and they never roll over. For a long time. His name - Colin McLaren. SONG: It's a jungle out there... In the 1990s. The Australian Government set up police operations across the country to find out ex actly what the Mafia was up to and stop them. I was part of the Victorian task force and that's the man I'm talking about - Colin McLaren. And that's his team - investigators. Italian translator. Squirrels. including me. I was a squirrel. Nothing to do with acorns. It was our nickname for surveillance operatives. And there were the bean counters. Loyalty is the core of N'Drangheta's success. You can't simply join N'Drangheta. You have to be born into an N'Drangheta family. N'Drangheta grows by marriages between the families. Antonio Russo is married to Maria Ricci. She's the daughter of Carlo Ricci. He's been the boss of the Griffith shebang for aeons. Antonio has inherited the reins from Carlo. Blood gives N'Drangheta its strength. Blood and absolutely no mercy. Arggh! Hi, Dad. Hey! Love you. Got soccer tomorrow, Dad. When was the last time I forgot? Never. Come on. Ciao. We started by buggering up their marijuana business using satellite surveillance to bust their crops 15 years before Google Earth. Three fucking crops in a month. Fucking satellite. How can the fucking thing see a marijuana crop from outer fucking space? They're costing us a lot of money. Antonio, we stop planting. Agreed? There. Fixed the fucker. Ex cept Antonio Russo was more than up to the challenge. But every step he took. We were right behind him. Excuse me! Have you got a sec? Um, I'm a bit lost. I'm looking for, uh... What is it? Market Street. Do you know where that is? Oh, Market Street - that one. So they must have unloaded 20,000 little marijuana babies. But they can't be going to grow them in there. There's not enough room. No. Mr Russo's got somewhere else in mind. Antonio's plan - hydroponics on a massive scale. Which needed a huge shed. Tons of equipment and some poor fool who was desperate enough to let his property be used by the Mafia. They're tooling up to grow under lights. They're shifting the marijuana babies into this shed here, out of sight of the satellites. Put them under growing lights, turn on the irrigation - $5 million worth. Antonio Russo connected to the plants? Rosario Torcaso connected to the shed. So we've got more than enough to do them for conspiracy to cultivate. Conspiracy's piss-weak, Roger. This is the top N'Drangheta brass. As soon as they're in that shed with the growing lights turned on, they're up to their eyeballs in cultivation, possession and distribution - 10 years, 6 years to serve. That cuts the N'Drangheta head off. So we're looking at, what, a month? When they're in, we'll move. I'll pencil a month into the time line. The clock's ticking, remember. A month? Even a humble squirrel like me thought it was ridicuously optimistic. It would never have occurred to the old guy to grow crops undercover, not in a million years. But Antonio Russo - this prick thinks outside the box. He's... A bright bastard. Mmm. OK, the Shepparton farmer, he, er, he telephone to Antonio Russo. The farmer says his wife now change her mind. "She wants nothing to do with N'Drangheta, full stop. " And Antonio says that he's relaxed about things, he understands. He says to wait 12 months and then reassess things. Fuck me. What do you wanna go to Griffith for? There is no guarantee they'll ever use the shed, and even if they do, we can't sit around on our arses waiting for 12 months. There's N'Drangheta here in Melbourne. Foot soldiers. Roger, we've got to take down Antonio Russo. I've never been to Griffith. I just wanna go up there, sniff around the place, suss out... We've already spent a fortune on the squirrels' travel and meal allowance in Griffith. Roger, you said so yourself, alright - the clock is ticking. We've got a two-year statutory life. We're already eight months in. This is our one chance. Now, I just have to find another angle in. I'm sorry, but I don't think so. No. Can we clean up those marijuana babies? Yep. Waiting to speak to the local DI now. I thought we'd dummy up a drug raid, arm's length from us, you know, local boys and girls acting on local intel. I'll concoct something. Good. That's exactly what Colin and I thought. If the N'Drangheta get a whiff of us now, they'll go absolutely to ground. Good call. Griffith's lovely this time of year, isn't it? Oh, Inspector Davis, hello. Squirrels, who's up for showing Collie-Wol the sights and delights of Griffith? I've had a gutful of the dump. I've got an appointment with my gynaecologist. Yeah, if you promise Roger won't shit himself. Fools rush in. right? Colin, I'm sorry. You've offered no tangible justification for the outlay in TAs and MAs in excess of those already allocated against Griffith. Whatever, Roger. We're here, mate. Antonio was told that the marijuana babies were busted. He's very angry. Very angry's good. We might unsettle him. Watch yourselves. Thanks, Sandra. Antonio Russo's humble abode. Here he comes, the man himself. Local palace of dreams. Eau de stale beer. Yeah, I remember that cigarette smell from six months ago too. Two G&Ts, please. Our lucky day. 11 o'clock, two tables pushed together, the dirty dozen. Let's squirrel, squirrel. A local fucking uniform copper found the stuff. OK. Carlo Ricci. Rosario Torcaso. Antonio Russo - the prize. The man who had to come up with a new business plan before the family looked for a new boss. Colin knew it was a golden opportunity. But without being family. Without being blood. How coud he even start a conversation? There you go. Grazie. Come here, come here. I've got something for you. What you got for me? You put your little hand here. But if you win, you share with me. I know what he wants to share with you, sweetheart. I've had a vision, so go with me. Just stay here. Excuse me, has anyone played this one recently? No. Beauty. See, I've got this theory that these are programmed to pay out after a period of inactivity. A scientific theory, of course. There's no system. Trust me. I do know the people who own these machines, though. Oh. They're sitting over there if you wanna complain, but I wouldn't. Nah. It's a quick-and-the-dead world these days. Make a dollar any way you can. It's thirsty work, this. What are you drinking? Rum. I'm Sara. Herlihy. Hi, Sara. Cole Goodwin. "Coal'? Like as in"coal' - Newcastle kind of coal? No, C-O-L-E. Oh. Old family name. Really? Tradition - that's so good. Where you from? Melbourne. Mmm, I love Melbourne. I've never been there, but I just... I know I'd love it. What do you do? Self-employed. I'm an art dealer. Wow. I love art. Yeah? Yep. Can you... Sorry, just excuse me. Just a sec. Hey, boys. I'll see you later, yeah? Well, you're a naughty man. Hey, Sara, I can be pretty fucking naughty too. I'll see you later. Ciao. Oh, nice tits. Thank you. Nice shirt. Could you show some respect? Hi, lover. My name's Cole Goodwin. I'm a Melbourne art dealer. And we're overnighting here on our way to Broken Hill to Pro Hart's gallery. Now it all became stunningly crystal clear to me. My team leader was flying by the seat of his pants. But what did I know? I was only a squirrel. I love Pro Hart. Yeah. He does key rings. For the next two hours. Colin's strategy was to get Sara very drunk. I had a job. In Broken Hill? No, no, no. Here at Griffith Library. Fair dinkum? Mmm. But I'm friendly with the wrong Italians, so they said no. So no job. Bastards. Yeah. Well, it's because, um... Come here. It's because... they're the Mafia. N'Drangheta. They're, um, Calabrian Mafia. Huh. They're my boys. Yeah. But they're my only friends here. Sorry I'm late. Traffic. What have I missed? We're infiltrating the N'Drangheta. Cole Goodwin, art dealer, will have cards, brochures and stationery printed up inside 24 hours and the Pro Hart key rings are organised, mate. Good stuff, mate. Roger, good morning. Infiltration? Yep. Jude and I found the perfect back to ride in on - a female associate desperate for friends. There's no way into the N'Drangheta. You heard Vito. What's more, Jude is only a squirrel. The art world has a seriously... A very good squirrel. She is, mate. But the art world has a seriously shonky underbelly. That's our angle and that's what's happening. So you're prepared to risk Jude's life? No. I am. Infiltration isn't undercover. Undercover's pretending to be a waiter, a cab driver for a couple of weeks. Infiltration is about burrowing into your targets' hearts, winning their trust and living their lives with them for however long it takes... ...as long as they don't twig to you first... ...and kill you. If you're up for this, I'll be glad. And if you're not, then I'll understand completely. If you think I can do it... It's not what I think. It's going to be your life at risk. Yours if I screw up. Yeah, but I've been there and I've done it, OK? I know the risks. So I want an audio link back to this office, Tiny, but I am not wearing a wire, OK? I hate the things and this operation's long-term, so way too risky. Coward? Yeah, got it in one. I've got a mobile phone I've been having a bit of a dick around with. Technically it's still in R&D, but the bugger's testing its little plastic head off. Functioning mobile phone. Push 5-1 on the keypad - enables it as a transmitter. Transmission mode cancels phone capability so no-one can call you when you're transmitting. You're a star, Tiny. You're a scholar, Col. One other thing - it sucks battery power in transmission mode. I'm working on it, but take spare batteries, crates of them. Yeah, right. The Calabrian Mafia? You're insane! I mean, we're Sicilian, we can be evil. Those Calabrians are seriously dangerous mothers, mate. That's not a caponata. That's not Sicilian, mate. That's a... that's a skip version of Sicilian. Come over here and ask me some questions. Alright. OK. I'm now an art dealer. I need to know more than I do. Alright. What's a Norman Lindsay original sketch worth? Pen and ink - 1,200 bucks. Pencil - 900. Well, I'm off to work to try and poison someone. Hey, your old man's disappearing out of your life again, Chelsea. Mixing it with murdering Calabrians. I'm used to it. I love you, Papa Bear. Ciao, Uncle Vinnie. Ciao, bella. See ya. Colin had raised Chelsea alone since she was 18 months old. She never stopped worrying about him. Come on, bubba. Let's see what we've got here. Hmm. Please be careful. You're the only Papa Bear I've got. I love you. Chelsea. It's not acting. There isn't a script to follow. It's a matter of sticking to the strategy, being utterly believable, and winging it. Being comfortable in our art dealer and fiance skins, comfortable with each other as an engaged couple. Exactly. Hanging in and surviving. Am I flogging this stuff? Yes, but it's helping. I don't know if this is strictly according to the manual, but I'm shitting myself. Can you sing? Not for nuts. Me neither, but I've found it helps. We can put away the bad memories together... I don't know the words. ? Forever ? Watching you touch ? We're past this much, yeah ? I'm alone with you tonight ? I'm alone with you tonight I'm alone with you tonight... Hey, what do you think? Uh... You never seen a girl in her undies before? Yes, sure. I just never figured you for those kind of undies. Bang goes a girl's mystery. I'd go the cream and black thing. Low-cut blouse for Rosario Torcaso's benefit. Now, we can't prepare beyond setting ourselves goals for each time. Understood. I'd have picked you for a boxers kind of bloke. Boxers are fine if you fancy an oversized slug flopping around in your pants. Bang goes your mystery. So our first goal tonight has to be to meet them? Meet them and make ourselves interesting enough that they wanna get to know us. This is as lowas I can get my top without my boobs falling out. If I take my bra off I'm gonna look like a slapper. You're absolutely fine. Spare batteries for the phone? Ready, lover? As I'll ever be, fianc. The key rings! Thank you so much. I'll treasure them. We did promise. We always keep our promises. Do you wanna meet my boys? I told them everything about you. Do you remember my boys? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're just over here. OK. This was it. No turning back. How do you make small talk when your mind's completely blank? Boys, these are my friends. Make small talk with fruitgrowers... ...whose orchards are killing fields? Cole Goodwin and Jude Powell. This is Carlo Ricci, Antonio Russo and his brother Rocco. Rosario Torcaso and his brother Dominic. Please join us. Maybe they weren't in the mood to kill anyone tonight. What will you drink? Sara maybe already knows. Two G&Ts? Spot on. Thank you, Sara. This your first time in Griffith? No. This is, what, our second time? Yeah. I remember your first time. Yeah? Mmm. I'm sorry, I don't recall. What a lovely place - Griffith. Yeah. It is so peaceful and relaxing. Thank you. We like it. It's sad there is a bad reputation here. I haven't come across that. Or me. But, anyway, what's a reputation worth? I mean, Melbourne's is for four seasons in one day. Thank you. Personally, I like variety. Thank you, Sara. Have you been to Melbourne, Rosario? Many times. What about Lygon Street? Do you like Lygon Street. The restaurants there? Sure. We like Tiamo and. Uh... Oh, you like, obviously, Italian food. Yep, grew up with Italians. Sort of an adopted son. Sunday lunch in the backyard when they come home from mass. Open the fridge, caponata, you know, with the fresh sardines, homemade cassata. You grew up with Sicilians? Yeah, yeah. Good people. Yeah, not bad people, for fucking Sicilians. See, that's Calabrian humour. Yeah, well, they cook the best Italian food I've ever had. Really? If you're hungry, if you would appreciate some nice Calabrian cucina, my family own a restaurant in this street. You're welcome to come. We'd love to. We'll show you what real Italian food is. Huh? So far. So good. Now came the difficut bit. We had to show them we had something they w anted. But they had to discover it themselves. Fichi ripieni alla Calabrese. I know that is stuffed figs, but "alla Calabrese"? "Alla Calabrese". Yeah, sure, it's, uh... it's the sauce. It's not the sauce. It means it's cooked like in Calabria. I get it now. How you become art dealer? I grow grapes, citrus fruit. My family grew them. Your family was art dealers? No, no, no. I was maybe 18, backpacking around Europe and stumbled upon the art galleries, and, well, they blew my mind. So, uh, you earn a commission? Sell a painting, get a percentage? Spinaci e patate arrosto. Grazie. Oh! What is wrong with your phone? Feels like it's going to burst into flames. Yeah. She's warm. I told you it was too cheap to be any good, lover. She can't walk past a bargain. Am I in trouble again? Your bargain mobile phone is about to burst into flames. Well, you've lost every expensive one I've bought you, so... It's like my wife - cannot walk past bargain. So where were we? Um, commission. Put it this way, Antonio. If I had to rely on commission, I'd still be driving a Commodore. I have a fruitful relationship with some very clever clients. What sort of things do you learn from these, uh, clever clients? OK, so long as you're not the tax man. I learned things like where do you hide a mountain of cash so that the tax man MIGHT see it? It could be staring him right in the face, but he'd never recognise it. Yeah, it's a print. Mm-hm. Cost maybe $50. You know that. The tax man doesn't. You spend 200 grand, cash, on a Tom Roberts and put it right there, the tax man will walk right past it. 200 grand, cash, hidden in full view. And if you pick the right painting, you can turn a profit on the resale too - 40%, 50% over two years sometimes. You know, you're a very good businessman, Cole Goodwin. I honestly can't remember the last time I complained. Terrific night, Antonio. Thank you very much. It was a lovely night. It was nice meeting you both. Next time you come through, maybe we see each other again, hey? Sure thing. Hey, um, do you know, is there a United Bank branch in town? Yeah, yeah, go two streets, turn left. Good man, Dominic. Thank you. Thanks, Dominic. Thank you, everyone. Goodnight, all. Ciao. I can't believe I got through that. I can't believe Tiny didn't tell me the fucking phone cooks itself. Please tell me this gets easier with practice. I wish I could. He's in between girlfriends, isn't he? The revolving door's in for repairs I believe, yes. How long's it been since he's had a root? Your point being? Look, Jude's a sort and a half, but there's just no way in the world. He's a pro. It'd compromise the operation. Yeah, not to mention constitute a sacking offence on top of legal ramifications. Jude's untrained, therefore vulnerable. Which is exactly why he wouldn't. Antonio Russo's as seriously bright as we figured. He's looking for new opportunities, which means he's receptive. You can't want more in a target. All up, we're on track... ...as long as those, um, undies don't derail us. If these are posing an operational difficulty, I can always switch to cottontails. I spoke to the accountant. Cole Goodwin was talking of a thing called money laundering. Usually it makes your cash look like it's legitimate, but with Cole's way, you can make 50% on top. Because what is our cash earning us now? Our cash is safe now. We're not fucking businessmen. What we do, we do well. What do you think about Cole Goodwin? No way I'm gonna do it. Life's too short. Think business. What do you think about Cole Goodwin? Tell me. Never trust a fucking skip. Times change. I like his mind. I think we can use him. Sounded good last night, champer, Mrs champer. Early days, mate. Very early days. Hey, what's Tiny's story on that overheating? Well, best guess - it's battery related. He's sourcing stronger ones to test as we speak. Oh, and, er, George Henderson from the United Bank called. Apparently staff at the Griffith branch did a recce on Cole Goodwin's accounts. You made an impression. Er, how often does he fart in bed? Fuck up! We got a sweep running. Favour, Roger. Oh, a hard man to catch. I've had queries from above regarding our time lines. When can we expect to be looking at drug deals? When and if they happen. The last thing that we need is a paranoid N'Drangheta, so can you please talk to the other states' section leaders, tell them to hold off any N'Drangheta busts until further notice? Done. Colin wasn't making it up when he told Antonio he'd grown up with Italians. That's the secret of a good cover story - make it as close to the truth as possible. Thanks for coming, Uncle Colin. Dad said you might not be able to make it. No, I wouldn't miss it for the world, sweetheart. The most important day in a Catholic kid's life and you got here for her? You agnostic bastard. Ask him if he's making it to my chef graduation. Are you gonna make it to the most important day in your only kid's life? I promised I'd try, OK? Try! Try? Mmm. You slack parenting bastard. I'll do my best, sweetheart. ? Watching you touch ? We're past this much ? I'm alone with you tonight I'm alone with you tonight... In this job. You never. Ever get over the nerves. It was the Calabrians' move. We coud only play it by ear. Colin's job was to become Antonio's mate. Mine - to keep Rosario happy. Have you still got this fucking thing? Let me get you a new one. I know a guy. Thanks all the same, but I actually had it fixed. But it's shit! Well, it's sentimental shit, OK? Jude got it for me. Capito? Jude, I gotta ask you something. Ask away. Cole, this picture thing - I spoke to the accountant. He liked the idea. Mm-hm, OK. Rocco's shy. Can't talk to a skirt. His balls turn blue like they're gonna burst. I don't know what was worse - Rosario's mouth. His B O. or his dress sense. Maybe you have time to find a nice painting for my wall. Yeah, sure. I mean, there's bound to be an art auction on somewhere, you know? The accountant said also maybe we can find other w ays to work together. Maybe make use of your bank account. Er, park some money for you? For a commission, of course. Nah, mate, I wouldn't have a problem with that. You guys must be doing alright out of oranges. You bet. Plenty money in oranges. And lemons. And we have other, um, irons in the fire. It was the first hint he'd given. But a giant step in the right direction. It was a double infiltration. We were seducing him and he was seducing us. 50 fucking grand for that? It's nice. I like it. So do I. You got good taste, Jude. This, er, Maria, my wife. Cole Goodwin, Jude Powell. Lovely to meet you. Oh, these are noisy kids, Louisa, Little Tony. Louisa! I think Antonio should spend less time with Rosario and much more time with Cole. Every so often I'd catch myself thinking. "These are very w arm. generous people. I like them. " ? Feels like ? Someone's alw ays looking over my shouder ? So scared ? I'm frightened just to w alk around the corner ? Last night ? Your eyes upon me everywhere ? Looking over my shouder Oh. oh... For a drug-dealing Mafioso, Antonio Russo's pretty good company. ? Looking over my shouder Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. Cole, what do you reckon about Italian religious art? Oh, I could take it or leave it. You can be honest. Maria likes this stuff. Hi, Jude. Hi, Cole. Maria. What do I like? Religious art. Hey, you leave my religious art alone. It's my faith. Coffee? Yes, please. Me, I have faith. But I hate religious fucking art. If I see another agonised John the Baptist... ...I'll amputate his fucking head myself. So, Cole Goodwin, these other irons we have in the fire - a small business we have on the side. Plenty of dope smoked in art business? Mate, the art business would be paralysed without choof. That's interesting. We... we was wondering. But that's nothing compared to the music business. I've got some contacts in music and they love their drugs, believe me. That's even more interesting. So one that size, that's a Frankie size. That's a Tony size. Keep going, keep going. That's my size. Jude? Jude? Yeah. I'm studying for my confirmation. Oh, Louisa, I'm not Catholic. You don't have to be to test me. Oh. OK, the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit? Can't you ask me the disciples? Louisa, you know the disciples. Come on. What are the seven gifts? Hey, Cole! Cole! What does he bloody know? Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute! What are you doing?! What are you doing? You are not good! I know. Not very good. That's no good. Sorry. It's the Italian priority that works for me. Family. Why you feel so much for family, Cole? Growing up, there wasn't much of one. Makes you swear you'd do it differently if you ever have one. One day, I hope you have the opportunity. Mmm. Your road has been hard, huh? Oh, you do your best. Don't ever make our road hard, Cole. Ever. Welcome to our family, Cole Goodwin. What are you telling me? Something's happened. Leave it with me. I'll fix it. Madonna, madonna, madonna, madonna. He's coming. We have a problem. Business. We have a snitch. We must go. A snitch? Someone we thought we could trust, huh? Not your problem. We find the snitch, they have problem. Stay, enjoy yourselves. We didn't know what the hell had happened. But Colin grabbed the opportunity to prove that we'd been in the house in case Antonio ever tried to deny he'd met us. Yeah. Thanks, Sandra. Yeah, good work, mate. Some Queensland admin dickhead decided an N'Drangheta bust in the Queensland boondocks wouldn't impact on our operation. How could they not think that that would impact on us? Dunno whether you've noticed this, Jude, but the service is made up of two ranks that usually manage to achieve something, and above us about seven ranks of clowns who wouldn't know if their penises were on fire. Junk food and cat piss - perfect way to celebrate a graduation. If Chef could see us now... Hey, who's missing? Um, my dad. We share. He couldn't make it, but I know he's here in spirit. Cheers. Cheers. ? I've got no helmet Baby. I've got no light ? When your boyfriend comes back to town ? I'll be gone I didn't choose to be riding with you... Carlo Ricci's been on the phone to Calabria. He wants someone called Massimo Falzetta on the first plane out here. Massimo who-the-fuck? I don't know. Guido and the anti-Mafia unit in Rome will know. Thanks, Sandra. Carlo Ricci's importing a snitch-hunter - Massimo Falzetta. According to Guido in the anti-Mafia unit in Rome, his talents are spoken of with awe. Ciao, Rocco. I think maybe we find some place nice to talk business. What about back at our place? Jude does not want to be bothered by men discussing business. I don't mind men discussing business. Come on, Jude. Let's go, sweetheart. Jude, you'll get him back again, huh? Maybe a couple of hours. Come on, Jude. Let's go, honey. 'Bye. Papa Bear. Papa Bear! Hey, Papa Bear. Papa Bear! Hey, Papa Bear! Papa Bear, hey. Huh, what's that slag on? Alright, are we ready? We can keep a fucking secret. So if you can, Jude don't have to know nothing. Unless you make our road hard, then we tell her. Time to get down to business, Cole. About time, Antonio. This ain't for you lot's delicate ears, Monica. Go lick each other all over, huh? I'll see you later. OK. Cole. We have another iron in the fire. We're getting into cocaine. What do you reckon? You're diversifying? It's a good business practice. If you don't grow, you go backwards. Yeah, absolutely. What's the market like, you reckon, in the art business, music business? What? For cocaine? Mmm. You've never seen so many disintegrating nasal passages. We're importing half a tonne. But we already got stock - 195 grand a kilo, pure. What's that worth on the street? Like, a mil? Right, fair enough. I'll take a kilo of cocaine, thanks. Nice finally doing business with you boys. Hey, what's the fucking hurry, Cole? Relax. We give all our new clients a fucking present. This is Rachel. We'd have wrapped her up for you, but she gets off at that sort of thing. She'll take good care of you. How you doing? So... ...what's your fancy? To be perfectly honest... ...I'd rather not. ) I'm gonna keep you up for hours. For Christ's sake, let's keep this off the record. A working girl pole-dancing on your knob while you're on duty is some serious shit. Troops, progress? All good. I think he's on top of things. You're nice, Cole. How come you know Rosario and Antonio? They buy art from me. I'm an art dealer. Cool. I like art. Cool. Rosario must be really interested in you and your art. He's a good guy, Rosario. And Antonio. A couple of good guys. Good mates, in fact. Chelse. Chelse. How could you do that?! Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. How did that happen? How was I to know? OK? And what were you doing there? Working. I got a job. Well, how am I to know? Because I left you a note, but it was still there two weeks later, so I just threw it away. I'm sorry. Well, if we didn't always have to communicate by notes... One day. OK? One day. Yeah. Well, this is the same old bullshit! Shhh. One day. In the meantime... ...you don't know what those notes mean to me. OK? How was your night, anyway? Yeah. Don't ask. Chelsea alright? Yeah. She's amazing. You should meet her. I almost did. As for the other matter, lucky we're not engaged. I would have cut your oversized slug off. Well, I did order a kilo of pure coke. As you do prior to a root in a brothel. Days in the office don't get much tougher. I reckon this is almost better than a real engagement, even without the humping. Been there? Still am there. Is he in the job? Powerlifter. Professional? Just powerlifts. This is exactly what I mean. About what? What you need in a partner. Someone you can trust. And someone who trusts you. Yeah, well, you can't put brains into monuments, can you? Ah, thanks. I owe you one. What now? A mate of mine with the NSW task force reckons that word of our infiltration is all over Sydney and Brisbane. How can it be? There was a task force admin national conference a while back in Sydney. Afterwards, a little bit of socialising and professional dick-measuring, and all of a sudden our supposedly top secret operation wasn't anymore. Great. How long till that reaches Griffith? Well, it better not or we're dead. Clowns. I've never applied for $195,000 for a kilo of pure coke before. Think about it like you're applying for a new globe in your desk light. Times it by a million. Sandra? The response to our application just came back. You might wanna sit down. They've approved $50,000. Maximum. What the fuck am I supposed to say to Antonio? "Oh, yeah, sorry, mate, you know, 50 grand's our limit. "Me and Jude are just some pissant fringe players. " The whole point of this operation is to do deals. You know, that's all the clowns are on my back about. Excuse me. I logged Carlo Ricci talking with Antonio. You are going to meet Massimo Falzetta later tonight. Carlo wants him to look you and Jude over. Piacere, Massimo. Piacere. Nice to meet you. This is my fiance, Jude. Piacere, Jude. Piacere. Massimo understand more English than he speaks, huh? He's come out to help organise with the cocaine importation. Fair enough. Excuse us, Carlo, Massimo. Yeah, we got, er, business to talk, don't we, Cole? Organise payment for a kilo of coke, deliveries, boring detail stuff. Sure. Jude, do you wanna organise some drinks for everyone? Absolutely. I can offer everyone a lovely red wine courtesy of some very generous friends of ours in Griffith. For starters, you're probably not gonna wanna split a kilo of coke, are you? We can't. It comes in sealed packages of one kilo. You got problems, Cole? Only that this guy's umming and ahhing over three Norman Lindsay oils. Quarter of a mil's worth for 200 grand, and he's still mucking me around. Well, that is disappointing. It's pissing me off. You said you had plenty of contacts. Yeah. Fuck him off, get the money somewhere else. Um... Nice house. Thank you. Massimo fine with the red wine? Er, yeah, he is. And he says that, er, he wish he could live here. The blast ripped through the office on the top floor of the 12 - storey building. Contained in a parcel. The bomb blew up... On Tuesday. March 2. 1994. An obscenely destructive phosphorus bomb delivered terror to Australia. The target was the National Crime Authority's Adelaide task force office. The victim was Geoffrey Bowen. Colin's equiv alent in South Australia. Who are IBM Promotions, Pete? Beats me. Be computer-related, yeah? I didn't order anything computer-related. Could be a bomb. Ooh, yeah, right. There's no wires. The dead man was Sergeant Geoffrey Bowen. A senior detective... South Australian Mafia identities were at the top of the suspect list. This is a wicked and evil thing that's been done. No - one has ever been convicted. Completely out of the character of this country. The NC A has a wide-ranging role. Investigating organised and white-collar crime. Most recently it's tackled drugs and the Mafia. We beefed up our security. Every task force in the country did. But it didn't help me. I'm not leaving the operation, Roger. No way. We couldn't have got this far without Jude. I'm sorry. It's come from above. I don't care how high it came down from, Roger. What, did it come from the same clown that wouldn't organise full-tote odds to buy that kilo of coke... It's been deemed too dangerous... ... effectively sinking... ...for Jude to continue. ... our operation? Did it come from the clown... I understand your feelings... ...that got on the piss in Sydney, opened his mouth and nearly got us killed?! We cannot risk Jude's life! Now, this is not, I stress, it's not negotiable. Fine. It's understood for operational legal reasons two operatives are required for the purposes of corroboration. I'll try to put another male operative in Jude's place. ? This endless ride has got me. I know ? I've been holding on by a thread Falling tow ards the end... Hang on. But I have been held by a thousand hands... 26. One for each week of our engagement. And I know that something is wrong... Thought you could do with some company. This stuff's like battery acid. I can hear it chewing through the glass as we speak. You started without me, you prick. They can get fucked, mate. Every clown that's ever fucked us over. Fuck all of them. Yeah, goodo. Where's your corkie? See, the proverbial bar, champer, the bar that one sets for oneself - your bar is set permanently up there somewhere. I mean, a Mexican bloody jumping bean on amphetamines couldn't clear it. Beats me why. And if that's not enough, you let the fucking clowns get to you. You take it personally. Alright? You can't. OK, shit happens in life, otherwise the world's perfect, and it's not. Except Collingwood Football Club is. Geoffrey Bowen paid the ultimate price, mate, and we can't get more than 50 grand. So walk away when Antonio tells me to piss off or walk away now? What's the diff? It's over. The only thing I'm gonna miss is his company. Yeah, you said he was good company. It bothered the shit out of me. That man has more balls and more brains than all the clowns put together. He kills people, champer. They can get you killed, Leigh, getting on the piss after a conference in Sydney. Colin. I told him not to call you. He tells me you're being a dickhead. You're out of it, babe. Better off. Hey, listen, you're not the only one with the investment. I put six of the craziest, most exciting months of my life into this. If you walk away now, I will personally put your oversized slug in a vice and I'll stretch it until it looks like that sausage in the photograph. Oh. That makes two of us, fianc. Sir, we've spent 18 months and goodness knows how many millions targeting N'Drangheta. Now, for an extra couple of hundred thousand we can clean them up. I'm no accountant, but that sounds like a mighty good investment to me. The Commissioner did his sums and saw the sense. Roger. Ever cautious. Insisted Colin wear a wire as well as carry the mobile phone transmitter. Cole, I was sorry to hear Jude's mother is not well. Mmm. Thanks, mate. I spoke to her this morning in Sydney. Things aren't looking good. She said to say hello. Give her our best regards, huh? Yeah, I will do. Thanks, mate. What's this? Is that really what I think it is? It's your kilo of pure fucking cocaine, you prick. OK. Let me stow this baby somewhere safe and I'll be back later with the cash. About 7:30? You do trust me to pay later? We know where you fucking live, skip. And at 7:30 on the dot... That should cover the cost of dessert. Followed two weeks later by 10 kilos of skunk weed. With funding freed up. Colin became a reguar at his local drug dealer corner store. 18 months of scheming. Sweating. And tradecraft all coming to fruition. And it got even better. Cole, this, um, business we've been doing, it's, um - what do you say? - chicken shit compared to what we have in mind next. Half a tonne of marijuana heads. Phwoo. Grown in New Guinea. $6 million worth. It come from New Guinea on a boat to this Queensland place, er... Horn. Horn Island. We load it onto a plane, fly it to Griffith. We gift you one-sixth share, $1 million worth. The cost to you - zero. Nothing. Just find us an aeroplane and a pilot. For some reason, we humble fruit growers have trouble hiring aeroplanes. Done. Jeez, when it fucking rains around here, it pours. And this is the icing on the proverbial. This cuts the N'Drangheta's head off and buries it. Is this doable? Yeah. It's gotta be. I mean, sure, I run into coppers with covert experience and a pilot's licence every day. Yeah? Well, let's find us one. I'd shit myself if I had to front the N'Drangheta, and so would he. I'm down to this guy. I wish I could say he filled me with more hope. Senior Sergeant Jim Zignatowski was a loy al Victoria Police officer who enjoyed his posting in the peace and quiet of the Coroners Court. So, where's Horn Island? Torres Strait, just off Cape York Peninsula. Then fly back to an airfield just outside Griffith, NSW, with cargo - half a tonne of marijuana heads. And at least one passenger - Colin McLaren. Undercover as Cole Goodwin. But, in all likelihood, there'll be two passengers - Colin, and Rosario Torcaso, a member of the N'Drangheta. The endra what? Calabrian Mafia. Oh. No, it all looks feasible. Half-tonne of cargo, couple of passengers. Have to rip the interior out to fit it all in. Looking at something fairly sizeable, e. g., your Navajo Chieftain. Alright. Can you fly one? In my sleep, Colin. You gotta remember "Cole'. Alright? You gotta remember "Cole'. Don't worry, we're cooking, Ziggy. Cole. Cole. Yeah, Cole. Civil aviation bods will go mental. Why's that? I haven't got a licence to fly a Navajo Chieftain. Bit like having, well, a car licence and you wanna drive, e. g., a bus. I could get a licence, though. Only take a couple of months, but, Colin. Yeah. Cole. Sorry I'm early. Antonio up yet? Just woken up. Ooh. Bad timing. Can you tell him that the plane's not a problem, but there's a bit of a glitch with the pilot. We're looking at maybe eight weeks. So you got a pilot? Yeah, of course I've got a pilot. We've gotta meet him, approve him. That's the glitch. He's in demand 'cause he's the best. The boat has to land here, at the jetty. There's nowhere else. This is all mangroves. You've got about 10-12 metres of grassy area here right at the end of the strip. Now, the plane will park here for quickest, most efficient loading. So, I'm thinking that we put the SOG-ies in here, in the mangroves, which will be here. And that way they can cover both directions - the plane and the jetty. Once that plane is loaded, then we move in. OK? You, you're gonna be in Griffith with the cavalry awaiting my call to take down the N'Drangheta brass. Colin, why the SOGs? Because they're the pros. But they're Melbourne-based. The SERTs are Queensland-based. The SOGs are the pros, Roger. One more week and we get our pilot. That's good news, huh? I've told Rosario a hundred time, you don't let us down. I tell you something too, you're lucky you're small businessman. I have big business, all I get - a big headache, huh? This stuff Italian? Mmm. Italian Renaissance. I see no John the Baptist asking for his head to be fucking amputated, huh? Grazie a dio, eh? Mmm. The Italian Renaissance artists led the way into secular art, non-religious stuff. You're really into art, huh? "Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. " Yeah. That's nice. I like that. Yeah, I wish I'd thought of it before Picasso did. Cole... I have a confession. Mmm. Massimo Falzetta come here to find the snitch. Carlo's idea. Carlo never trusted you and Jude. Even when I vouch for you. Even when I stake my own life that you are trustworthy, he no believe me. Old men, huh? Old men, huh? Hey. Maybe we bring Maria here, you and me and Jude. Mmm. Wash from the souls the dust of everyday life. Ziggy. Oh, g'day, mate. How are ya? When did you last shower, mate? Oh, about a week or so ago. Thought I may as well look the part. Been sleeping on the couch at home and everything. So, um... I meet you and Rosario Torcaso, Weipa Airport, er, about 3am, day after tomorrow. Just so you know, Ziggy, this is out of satellite range after Weipa. After that, we're on our own. It might be a good idea if you just kept a very low profile, OK? Just keep the pressure off yourself. Mate, I'm way ahead of you. Mr Invisible is me. Right. Just fucking one week. That's enough! Rosario, you ready to go? I'm sorry, Cole, Rosario got too many things to organise in Griffith. I don't know what the fuck's going on. And there isn't a weapon on that plane. I'll see if I can organise to get you one at Brissy or Cairns airport. Thanks. Couldn't shake him in Brissy. No, he even went for a piss with me. So Brissy said. I'm sorry, babe. That was our last chance. Listen, one more quick thing. You have the SERTs at Horn Island. Fuck! Roger's doing. I'm sorry. More economical than flying up the SOGs. I can't talk to you again after Weipa, so good luck. Thanks, Sandra. Morning, Cole. Hey. Rosario. Er, not Rosario. This is Massimo Falzetta. How good's your memory? Too bloody good. 10 minutes till the boat arrives, Massimo. Hey, Rosario. Hey, don't worry, Cole's on top of it. He'll call us. OK? Massimo, I can hear the boat. Well, they're on time. Here they come, Massimo. Police, freeze! Police! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Get down on the ground! Get down on the ground! Don't move. On the ground! Ah, the man himself. Congratulations. A SERT broke cover when he got pissed on. We missed the boat and the drugs. No matter. We got them on conspiracy to import. That and everything else. 13 N'Drangheta in custody, including all the top brass. It was a fuck-up, Roger. A monumental fuck-up. We cut the N'Drangheta's head off. Mission accomplished. Er, I'll do my best to ensure that nothing comes of the, er, intercourse with the prostitute business. I'll do my best, but, um... never can tell. No more notes. Ever. I promise. The Calabrians' committal hearing was the first time they'd set eyes on us since their arrest. We call Detective Sergeant Colin McLaren to the stand. Or. As they were probably entitled to describe it. Their betray al. It's a two - w ay street. Betray al. You can feel betrayed and you can know in your heart that you have betrayed. And you wonder how you're going to live with it. Please read the statement. I solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Be seated. Colin spent six days in the witness box. Day three was the killer. Where did this meeting take place? At the Green Gardens Hotel. And was it on the second or the third meeting that you allege my clients discussed the importation? Our case was overwhelming. All the defence coud do was try to undermine Colin's credibility as a witness by catching him out on details. ...one of which you claim in June of last year, 9 June. 11 June, in Mr Russo's suite. Tell the court what transpired. I arrived early. I knocked on the door, and Mr Torcaso told me that Mr Russo was still in bed. And? And I went to the bedroom door, I knocked, then I opened the door. And?! And Mr Russo was in bed with Kim. Kim was a waitress from Griffith. She accompanied Mr Russo on several trips to Melbourne. In the N'Drangheta world. Honour isn't just important. It's all that matters. What goes on in priv ate is priv ate. Even if everyone knows it goes on. There's no logic. That's just the w ay it is. But when priv ate becomes public? How are you? Shithouse. Maria's face. Hazard of the trade. How are you? They're gonna be committed. They'll be convicted. We should be celebrating. Yep. You know, there is one bit of tradecraft that I never got around to mentioning. Yeah? What's that? The very best you can ever hope for in a partner... ...is a mate. And we done good, mate. See ya when I'm looking at ya, Roger. Sorry? I just quit. What on earth for? That's a huge result. Don't you understand the future that's set up for you? Yeah. Reckon you'll get a promotion out of it? I'm quietly confident. Yep. See ya when I'm looking at ya. Now, I've come to the realisation that the only way to avoid gooses pooing down on you is to work for yourself. There's no-one there to screw it up for you and there's no-one there to bask in the glory when you have a win. Sounds logical to me. Mmm. So that's why we're going into business. At first I was thinking a, you know, pensione. Like a B & B? Yeah. But then I thought, hang on, Chelsea's a chef, why not make it a ristorante? And then I thought, bugger it, go the whole hog, you weak sod. So it's gonna be called Villa Gusto. And it's gonna be an Italian hotel and restaurant with me hosting and pulling corks and you cooking. What do you reckon? Ours. Antonio Russo served 8 years of his 13-year sentence. In those days. A quick guilty plea earned a reduction. He'd been advised not to return to Griffith... Antonio! ...but that wasn't Antonio's w ay. Some said Antonio was punished for getting conned by a skip. Most reckoned he'd have been forgiven that mistake if he hadn't publicly dishonoured his wife. Colin McLaren. You fucking user. You fucking, fucking user. Who's this? Just somebody else you fucking used. What do you do? Sara. I hope Antonio Russo haunts you... ...for the rest of your days
