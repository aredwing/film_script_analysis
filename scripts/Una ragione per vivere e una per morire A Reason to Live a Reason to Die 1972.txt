Looters, Confederate sympathizers, persons violating the curfew... or illegally possessing arms or any other people believed inimical to the Union, shall upon capture, be summarily executed, by order of the Officer Commanding, Maj. Charles Ballard, United States Army. Can you recommend a good restaurant here, mister? I got a couple of dollars. A man with a nose for grub, usually finds it. - Did you read that? - I can read. You will be shown hanged if behold much as nails an apple. - And would they? - I doubt it. Many loud noise scared of looters. As well as a solid citizen. I would sell my soul for a a roast turkey with chestnut. Shut up, will you? I'm feeling faint just thinking by it. And a hand of chicken, and on the side, a golden corn... ...all soaked in butter with a touch of cloves. Cloves ain't to my taste. All without a clove is a playful buttered corn. If they stick cloves in my corn, I'll sender it back. A whole ham... I can't stand the look at it. The proprietor always closes at noon, goes home to dinner... and comes back an hour later. I watched that grocery for a week. I reckon there's a lock on the door. But what I really need is a partner to keep an eye open outside while I'm inside. - Right in front of you. We split even. - A third and all you can eat. - I'm in. If someone comes along... Times are wasted. And Will be summarily executed... Hello there, friend. Could you spare a bite for a poor veteran who hasn't eaten long? He sacrificed his right leg fighting... ...to free the slaves like Abe Lincoln said was the only thing humane to do. - And so I gave my legs for my country. - Which leg? This here. They made it out of rotten wood, it swells up like a sponge in wet weather. - So, I'll... - Have you gone loco. You'll smash it! And show a little respect for a war hero, you cracker. I lose a leg fighting and you just sitting around and eating. To hell with you! It's got to be treason. The war's supposed only 30 miles from here. It's all the fault of that traitor, who surrendered at Fort Holman. He opened the gates and the rebels just strolled right in. The great dictator, the biggest in the world. That shells are bigger as wash tubs. Those Reds keep firing those guns to break up the Union's ranks. To keep our men hold up like frogs in a pond. Fort Holman was the best stronghold we had until that Pembroke just turned it over to the enemy. Do you think that guns will be on top of us? No, they're out of range of us. - Well, almost probably. - I wish they get this war over with. I lost a son at Fort Sumter, and for what, just to see these Reds ride inside my house. Yeah, I was at Fort Sumter too. I shot off so many bullets my rifle lightly melted in my hand. I had to spit on it to cool if off. Maybe your son was fighting right beside me! - 13th Brigade? - Sure it was, 13th Brigade. A real tough brigade! Say, you wouldn't have a little grub you could spare to an old soldier that lost a leg? Fighting alongside your own son? I hardly got the corn like he does. Sorry. I have never could do. Help! Help! Please, help! I've been broke! Sheriff, come quick! There are thieves in my store! Clean them all out! Do your duty! Open up there! Didn't your ma ever tell you that your eyes were bigger than your stomach? And now everything goes right back were it was. Well, what are you waiting for? The whistle. Hey, you was not at sleep. It's better you don't shoot. Otherwise all the soldiers in town are down on us. If I was you, I'd get rid of that gun in a big hurry. If they find it on you, you are dead. Did you read that post on main street? Ballard don't play games. You sure had me scared, man. You took the front lines too, huh. There are more lucrative here. Better pick in these rounds here. And it's safer, too. Hey look, we could join up. All I need is a friend behind to see nobody's watching... What about that cross? Just maybe you're making a collection for your private chapel. You got it off the altar, huh? Sure tell me you got there first. I know, it's yours. I didn't say it wasn't. I have got a bag full. And good stuff too... What about that? Nice, huh? Oh God, my God, how could I? How could I even think of stealing the church? When I think what a saint my mother was. She has been dead a long time. She'd turn into her grave. She wanted me to put on a cloth in her church, but look what I turned in. Well, I've had enough of this kind of life! I will be an honest man. and be in peace with the Lord. I'll give up all my belongings! The results of my sins! And thank you, Lord, for making me see the light. Repent, my brother, repent with me. You can't imagine how relieved I feel now. Give up all the fruits of your evil ways, turn them over to the Lord... and he will rescue you! You'll see the Lord will forgive you if you ask him. Give up your bad ways! - Repent, brother. - Move. Please, let me pass. Lord has guided me to you! Wait! Wait for me! Hey, stop a thief! Help, I have been robbed! - Hurry up, Sergeant! - Then who the hell are you? - What did they steal of you? - I am the sacrist. A gold cross was stolen from the church. If we don't we won't catch the thief. - What kind of cross is it? - It's a gold cross, that big. Covered with precious stones. Come on sergeant, he'll get away. Are you looking for me? And for this? - Is that him? - Yeah. And that's the cross. - It belongs to me. - To hell, it belongs to the church. - And that gun, too? - That is right, sergeant. Take it off. God bless you, Sergeant. - If you can give me the cross... - I'll give it to the priest myself. It is my responsibility. I am church caretaker. - Put the other in the car. - Aren't you gonna search him too? You can't do that. I am the sacr... - A couple of looters, sir. - Very well, to the major. Major Ballard, we caught them to loot the church in Buckstown. - Send the one with the hat on over to my quarters, sergeant. - Yes, sir. The court martial says you handed Fort Holman over to the enemy without a shot being fired. For God sake, why? I remember at West Point what you thought of Benedict Arnold, and what he tried to do. It's not important. Not important? Our campaign in the southwest depended on that stronghold. With your best friend I wish you'd rotten in that southern prison camp instead of... coming back here to the gallows, ordered by the Court Martial. Don't let the thought of executing me ruin your appetite, Charlie. - They will probably make you a Colonel for it. - It could be right. It's good wine. And what if I took Fort Holman back? - They'll make you a general for that. - You are impossible. Why do you want to retake it? It was you who gave it away. - It's a personal matter. - Also military. Once I've done it I'd disappear. You never see me again. You have my word on it, Charlie. You know me. I can't risk it. I have already lost a third of my men. Not with a frontal attack... ...but from within. Surprise them from within. From the defense platform, called the Pulpit, and across the suspension bridge... - ...through the gallery and into the fort. - You must be completely out of your mind. - It's impossible to reach the Pulpit! - It's not for me. With a few men. The orders are crystal clear. - I'm not allowed to spend one more soldier. - If the Fort's fallen, the route is to the north is open. You can get reinforcements from Gen. Canbie, you can take Santa Fe in one day. Sibley is in Arizona with his forces left the city practically defenseless. If you're wondering how I know, I just escaped from there. If we capture Santa Fe, Sibley will be cut off from his troops south of there. You'll cut him to pieces and chase him down to Rio Grande right through Texas, all the way to New Orleans. The whole southwest is yours again. It could decide the outcome of the war. I need twelve men... General. - When does that take place? - Tomorrow morning. - What are you waiting for? Get it over with! - Shut up, private pighead! The Major has an announcement to make. There is only... one hope that you still have lo let you escape the gallows. Volunteers are needed for a mission which is as dangerous as it's important. And if any of you are prepared to volunteer, I'll release you... in his custody... Gentlemen, I can't promise you nothing. Except a chance to die honorably, and possibly live. In any case, freedom at the end. Donald MacIvers, mule skinner. He fraud the army for $ 4,000 with a false requisition for a live stock he never delivered. - What about it, MacIvers? - All right. - Private Samuel Piggott. - Yeah, I'll accept. - Murdered his commander at Sandy Creek. Then raped that officer's wife when she discovered him trying to hide the body. Ted Wendel, caught stealing food supplies. - What do you say, Wendel? - You bet your ass! - This sir, we can't identify him. - Well, I know this one. The Lord set you on my trail? It's better I come with you then. But lead me not into temptation. I thought you'd gonna whistle, you rat! Will Culder. Stole vital medicines and sold them to a Confederate agent. What do you say, Culder? Yeah, I'll ride. Jeremy, half-Cheyenne. Killed a white man for selling alcohol to the tribes. You wanna come? This is the worst, a religious fanatic. Arrested in front of an army recruiting center for urging men not to enlist and assigning them rebellion. Eternal doom awaits you! Renounce war, repent! - Are you in or out? - The Lord is my shepherd... - "Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord. - Saith the Lord. - That's the cross your wife always wore. - Yes. - And Sergeant Brent wishes to volunteer. - Yes, sir. Corporal, free all these men. Except the last one. What would your life be worth out there with those cut-throats? What's it worth now? Thank you, Charlie. - Sergeant Brent! - Sir. - Organize the men in some kind of ranks. - Yes, sir. Here is your authority. Assume your responsibility. Excuse me, but just out of curiosity what direction are we going? East. According to the Colonel, we are heading east. You've got anything to do back east? - No, I don't think so. - And what about you, Will? East, west, north, south... it's all the same to me. What I don't like we're getting told where I got to go. Just you wait, you fat son-of-a-bitch. I'm gonna see you're gonna learn to whistle when I give you the finger. Pig stinking fat pig! If I ain't mistaken, this is the Rio Puerco. You are right. This running water has the name Rio Puerco. - MacIvers! - Yeah? - What's "Puerco" mean? All I know that it's Spanish. Ask the Colonel. He knows everything, that's why he is a colonel. He knows that it means dirty. But he's too fine to use words like that. - You should not have called him that, he'll be offended. - He ain't no Colonel no more. That's right, I had plumb forgotten. They adjusted the gentleman out. Because of treason. No, I can't believe that. An officer and a gentleman... - He was discharged dishonorably. - Tell me the reason why is not a Colonel anymore? - Because he is a traitor. - And we'll be judged by the company we keep! It's time we separate the men from the boys. Let's choose up sides. Well? What do you say? - Any of your guys want to stay with the Colonel? - No. I think it's a good idea to stick with the Colonel for a while. As long as he's heading for Santa Fe. I got me some unfinished business there. The Colonel is taking his assurances we'd be to leave and he'd be there alone. This is blackmail. He has got our guns! Piggott, I'll quote you an old maxim. "The innocent will inherit the earth." It's a long way to the sierra, anything can happen. - The first time he got of his horse, he's dead as a doornail! - Calm down, Willie. - Yeah, it's easy for you to talk. - He sounds like a big man. Sure, that's what makes an officer. Without a gun, they are no better than us. Something worse than an officer, is one who suck up to an officer! - He's letting all the horses! - What the hell is gong on? He let the horses go! The horses are free, but we're still prisoners. You... dirty, rotten double-crossing traitor! - Looks like you gonna walk to Santa Fe, Piggott. - He's gonna carry me on his shoulders! We're moving over to Confederate territory. So we can't do it on U.S. branded horses. - Bravo, Piggott! - Stop, that's enough. I said, hold it! - Just nerves. Why don't you guys relax. - Just a goddamn minute! Let's find out what this chicken Colonel has in mind. We are on to Fort Holman, gentlemen. To enter it, and retake it. - Let's go. We've got a train to catch. - What makes you think we're going with you? - Eight of us on foot are gonna storm that fort? - You must be crazier than we thought. - It's the job you men volunteered for. - Yeah, but that was with a rope around our neck. Well, Colonel Pembroke, it looks like your mission ends here. Speak for yourself. I want to know why the Colonel is in such a hurry to get back there. He wants to risk our ass to save his face - isn't that right? No, gentlemen, for gold. - Gold? - That's what he said. - Gold? - What gold? Captured Confederate gold that's buried down near a sundial at the fort. - That's what we're gonna get. - How much gold is it, Colonel? I would say, roughly there's around $ 500,000 worth it. - How much? - 500,000. One, two, three, four, five hundred thousand. - You can sure save a lot of face for 500,000. - Would you repeat that? Roughly there's around half a million dollars. - How much is Ballard's cut? - No. Ballard knows nothing about the gold. He send me out here to clear my name, and win him a promotion doing it He hinds us getting in there. It's not gonna be easy, but I can do it. And if the eight of us can work together, we'll makes Ballard a General... and we'll be living high in good old Mexico, rich and free. I almost forgot... Gentlemen... your weapons. - I think you're lying. - There's only one way to find out. - Yeah, by telling us where the gold is. - I already told you. Near the sundial. You better start paying attention to me. If you pull that thing on me one more time, you better be prepared to use it or I'm gonna shove it up to your ass! Just bring what you can carry easily. You won't get anymore out of him, even if you shoot his balls off. There she is, gentlemen. Our ride through the lines. It takes us about a half day's march of Fort Holman. This will be a high grade, but I know we can capture it. Let's move. This way. Colonel, you made a mistake sending that idiot, MacIvers. - He's a mule skinner, Brent. - The Colonel is right. How much longer are we gonna wait here? - We're going down now. Get your gear. - Come on, redskin. - Hey, Hog... - What is it, pa? - We've got company. - Good afternoon. - Well, stranger? We're just on our way to army headquarters and we stopped by to see if you had anything to eat. Sorry, mister. I don't mean to act unfriendly But you can't be too careful. - I imagine you got a lot of funny people walking by. - Yeah, they come and they go. Now you all come inside, behold, my daughter will make some dishes. April! Put more plates on the table, we've got guests for dinner. The land is not too generous these days. Who comes from afar, comes from God. Come in, friends. A real pleasure to have you. Go on, sit. - Where is the nearest Confederate base? - Up north. Fort Holman. - Fort Holman? How far is that? - 8 miles north, and a bit west. Say, you wouldn't have a horse for sale? A horse? The soldiers took everything when they passed through. You must be tired. If you want to stay the night I won't charge you. Thanks, but we're over due already. I ain't said Grace yet! Leave us our sins, Lord, and bless this food we're about to eat. The Dynamite! Get it from the stove! We damn near blew up ourselves, instead of Fort Holman. There is no fire in it! You just stay right where you are. - Fred, line them up against the fireplace. - I took you into my house, gave you food... - Sorry old-timer, you heard too much. - I didn't hear nothing! - Did you hear anything? - No. - They ain't done nothing to us. All we need is a few hours. We can tire and gag them. It's a half million dollars and our hides against theirs. - I beg you, we wouldn't say nothing! - We're not to blame if you talked too much. God knows, nobody asked you! You all look in the barn. MacIvers! - Why? - This is why... To steal everything he had! God knows how many they've murdered. - Try this on. We need a uniform - Who, me? Yes, you. Now we are only seven to share. Let me see it! Come on. How does it fit? How's that? What is that? "Colonel William A. Morrow from the security services of Georgia" - "is authorized to travel freely in all territories of the states, occupied areas" "and military zones." It could come in pretty handy. - Come on, Brent, you and I buy a horse. - Isn't that risky? - Yeah. Take it. Gonna do any shooting with it. You do as we end at Fort Holman. And all that gold too? Yeah, the gold too. What's this? You make it yourself? - Thank you. - Well, let's see... Malts, a sacks of beans, lard... coffee, bacon, cheese, salt, sugar, bread, whiskey... You'll buying supplies if there was a war going on! Whisky... what else? Oil fuse... - Gunpowder and rope. - Gunpowder, that's right. - That's about it. How much is it? - I know I forgot something. Corn meal, coffee bacon, cheese, whiskey, salt, sugar, lard, bread, rope, gunpowder, fuse... There's something missing. - That's got to be it. How much is it? - I'm trying to think! Don't rush me! Sugar... corn meal, whiskey. Pay the man, let's get out of here. I forgot to put down the mule! - That's a hundred dollars. - Are you gone out of your mind? Bon voyage and happy hunting down south. - How are you, Scully? - Not bad. Strangers here abouts? Yeah, two hunters bought the whole store. They didn't mention what they was hunting for. They bought gunpowder, fuse and rope and paid without bargaining. - A hundred dollars in cash. - Is that so? Which way did they go? - Out that way. - Thanks, Scully. Hey, you got to live up to our agreement as long as Scully do! They was caught. Come on, let's go. Let's see what you got there, boys. Why? Nothing special. Take a look. We won! We won! The war is over! Hooray! The war is over! Long live the Confederacy! The war is over! - What's happening? - The war is over! - Who told you the war is over? - A trapper up in the hills! This guy he just rode in from Santa Fe. He said: "The only sober man in town was a preacher." And he won't be for long! What are we waiting? He's no better than us! Let's get drunk! Let's all get drunk! Victory is ours! Long live the Confederacy! Free drinks now, it's on the house! Dance, buddy! - What's your name? - Robinson. Got any more, Brent? Yeah, sure. This is the first decent time we've had on this stinking mission. Don't give them anymore, they have had enough. - Give me that, Brent. - Oh, come on. - The Colonel don't want us to drink. - To hell with him. - He's an idiot. - Give me the bottle, Piggott. Piggott! Give me the bottle. Go to hell! Look what you've done, you bastard! It's your fault we all go hungry tonight! Colonel Pembroke, you gonna pick up those beans, one at a time. What did I tell you about that gun, sergeant? - I said, pick them up! - I want to see you on your knees. Now eat them beans. - Beans don't agree with me. - I'll shoot them out of your hand... ...and into your mouth. One at a time. How's that for a digestion, Colonel. That's enough. The party is over. - Always on his side. - I'm on my own side. He's the one who is gonna get me to Fort Holman. That's all. Too bad. They was real good. - Thanks, Eli. - I didn't like seeing you down on your knees. Worse things have happened to me. Why did you do it? They wouldn't have killed you. They need you too bad. I blame Brent for that. Piggott was just drunk enough to start shooting after the Confederates landed on us. - Is it that important? - Yeah, it's that important. Half a million dollars will buy us a lot of tortillas in Mexico. Oh shit, I wouldn't get on my knees for that. And neither would you. I got a feeling there's something else behind all this. The uniforms fits pretty good. Now let's say this is the Pulpit. And that's the bridge that leads to the gallery connecting with the fort. Now, there's an alarm system, and it's your job to see that it never goes off. The fort with its gallery and suspension bridge were all built to command the trail that passes through a mountain tunnel. Well, Colonel? If our little plan worked Eli is inside by now. - The Password? - Confederacy and liberty. - Take me to Major Ward. - Yes, sir. Sir, Santa Fe prison camp has confirmed that Pembroke has escaped. - When? - About ten days ago, sir. I want you to send two platoons from B-company. - I want a 24 hour patrol for - And you? What else do you want? - I request permission to remain overnight at the Fort, sir. - Report back to your unit. - My buttocks is awful sour, sir. Don't get smart with me, soldier! Major, I respectfully request permission to show the cheeks of my ass. Show him the quarters, but make sure he's out by morning. - I want Lieutenant Babbitt and Ryan report in this office immediately. - Yes, sir. There's no danger. He's only one man. - Can I make you a drink? - No, thank you. I would prefer to be alone. - Is there a sundial anywhere around? - A sundial? - Yeah. All the Confederate forts have a sundial. Well... maybe up there by that cannon. There's never been a sundial here when I've been around. That damn horse. After one week in the saddle I just got about the most sensitive buttocks in the world. You're real lucky. Robinson and Hutton are out on patrol. There's a couple of free beds. Otherwise you got to ride out of here tonight. You remind me of someone. IS that so? I've never seen you before. What we got to do now is wait for dawn and the changing of the guards. Eli, good luck. EMERGENCY Halt! What are you doing here? I didn't know where latrine was, and there were no signs, so I... Stop pointing at me. It is forbidden to come near the emergency panel. All right. Be quick about it. I can't stay here all night. - See you in the morning. - Right, Sergeant. Well, what the hell was taken you so long?! - What is going on here? - I was gonna pee. You picked the wrong place. Well, go on. - Well? - I can't do it when someone is around me. Please, mind moving a little out of sight. Come on! - You haven't done it yet? - Almost. That feels better. Now I can go to sleep. - Keep a sharp watch. - Yes, sir. It's almost dawn. What do we do? We wait. - Piggott, load off the dynamite. - Yeah. I'm so tired. - You had a long nab. How was your rest? - So, so. I got to go. Duty watch on Pulpit tonight. Hey, I'm afraid I can't sleep You mind if I come and get a breath of fresh air with you? - Uh... - Uh, what? Uh, nothing. He must have been caught. I bet the son-of-a-bitch is caught. You got enough ammunition here to fight off the whole Union Army. - How did you manage to bring it all in? - Oh hell, that was all here when we came. You got to say about the Yankees... they are really organized. - Hey, I get dizzy. - Come on! Just don't look down. - Lieutenant Wilkins! - Are you ready to relieve me, sergeant? - The great mountain air. - There is usually too much of it. - It blows you right off the bridge. - Them tents must be kind of precarious. - They're replaced twice a week. - And the men inside of them? - You like a cigar? - I prefer my pipe. - If you can spare a couple for the lads over there... - Oh, sure. Thanks. Thank you, Sergeant. Mighty fine these things are. Pull it down a bit. I said, let go! There, it's free. It's caught again. Hey, not too hard! It's gonna break. Easy... and pull! I told you it's gonna break.! If it breaks we start all over again. We're not getting anywhere this way. Pull! Easy. He has got it. Let go! What is it? I thought I was going to be sick. I'm waving out. I get me an attack, now I'm feeling better. Thank you. It is best that you turn in, you got a long ride this morning. It will be dawn in just a few more minutes. I know, there's something familiar about you. I just can't put my finger on it. Yeah? Well let me know when you figure it out. - Say, were you here when the fort was taken? - Hell, yes. - And I tell you it was a true miracle. - How's that? Well, we had half of Sibleys force massed down in the valley... with orders to take the fort at any cost. You know, what that would mean? - It would mean we'd been all wiped out. That's why. - Go on. There we was, all set to go, and then a miracle happened. Pembroke hold up the white flag and we just walked in here.. They're all the same them Yankees. They're turning in like a flash. Not Pembroke. He's tough as nails. The truth is that Ward got his hands on Pembroke's son. - Then what happened? - They send Pembroke word to surrender the fort. Or he would hang the boy. And Pembroke surrendered. - Smart trick. But he didn't hang the kid? - Oh no, Ward is a man of his word. He doesn't hang him, he shoots him. With Pembroke free, I sure wouldn't be in Wards shoes. Why? What chance has one man against a fort full of soldiers. I wouldn't change places with Ward for anything in the world. Being inside this Fort is safer than in a bank vault. Have you seen the alarm system? Ward connected it to that suspension bridge to blow it to hell. He's smart as hell, that Ward is. They say he invented the alarm-system out of own head. Kind of electrical thing but I don't know how it works. There's probably nobody that does but Major Ward. Anyway, every time I cross that bridge it scares the pants of me. You mean that if the alarm is set of, the bridge is gonna blow up? It's mined. If someone manages to storm the Pulpit and the emergency alarm goes off... the major, and only him, pulls a handle or something. And bang, the bridge blows sky high. - What's so funny? - That alarm system. I was taking a leak right at the alarm box. If I had peed on it would never have worked again! Just think, as for a call of nature, it's gonna could have cost the South the whole fort. A good thing I didn't ground it out. - Do you feel all right? - Sure. - What are you doing? - I've something in my jacket. A dice. How much do you wanna bet, you can't roll a six? - How did you do that? - Now you try it. Hands up! - What's the matter? - This one is one of loaded dice that belonged to private Robin. He took me more than $100 before I got wise to him. - This uniform must be his. - I found it. - Lieutenant Wilkins! - Who's that? - The sergeant at the watch! - Over here, lieutenant! - What is it, Sergeant? Look inside the jacket. I bet that's Robins too. This dice was in his pocket. I swear that I found it. Mine was completely worn out. - Lieutenant, give me a break. - All right, take him to Major Ward. Listen, we've had it here. Let's retreat before we are spotted. Give me the knife. I suggest your men to relax while you read this. Sir! I am Colonel Morrow, Secret Service of the Confederate Army... under the direct order of General Sibley. You are in trouble, Ward. - Well, what do you mean, sir? - What do I mean? I was sent here to check on your security. It is not existent! First I was able to pass with an elementary trick. Second: I was shown at your present, without checking on my identity. I could have assassinated you. Third: I had access to the powder magazine and could have blown up the fort. Fourth,... But why go on? In all my 20 years of service... I've never witnessed more flagrant bleaches of elementary security. - But Colonel Morrow... - There is no excuse! Sorry. I'll report detail to General Sibley. I'm tired and sour. I'm gonna need a few hours sleep before I leave to Santa Fe. Sergeant! You see the Colonel to my quarters. Then you make sure that he has everything he wants. Sir! Thank you. What are we gonna do now? - We could... - Yes? Morrow can only damage you if he reports what he has seen. - That's right. Go on! - But if he never returns to Santa Fe... And then he'd never would be able to make the report. And then? - An accident? - Oh no, no, no accident! Accidents are too risky. Accidents have a way to be investigated. Now he came here to check on our security measures. - And we showed him how tight it is. - That's right. Now he claims to be Colonel Morrow of the Secret Service. Sir, I can assure you I have never seen a Colonel Morrow at Fort Holman. He is a Yankee saboteur. That's right out of the nose. - What do we do with a Yankee saboteur? - We execute them. And all they can do is commend us for being so... For being so... efficient. And now, Lieutenant, I want you to keep him under guard and then when morning comes you show him all the southern hospitality. Let him show you the cheeks of his ass... And then you shoot his ass off. Halt! Who goes there? Halt, or I will shoot! Halt! Emergency alarm! The fort is under attack! On the double! Man, at battlement! - What the hell is going on? - They're attacking the Pulpit. - Pembroke. How many are there? - I don't know, sir. - But it must be serious. They sounded the emergency alarm. - The bridge. Second platoon, follow me! Piggott, you and the Indian guard the other end of this gallery. - Get some men and cover the tunnel! - You men! - Bring a machine gun, on the double! - You must take cover, please sir. We'll never get out of this trap by ourselves. - What are you looking for? - There is a ventilation shaft behind us. If we can break through then we can get right to the top. Find me a pick. Soldier! Back to your post! There's no time for court martial Execution on the spot! I've been looking for you, Colonel. We're almost out of ammunition. - There is a powder magazine. Take everything you need. Give him a hand. - Right. He is dead. - Are you finished? - Just about. What are they doing out there? They are waiting. They are blocked in the magazine. Get all guns... and keep them faced towards the tunnel. What can we do now, sir? Well, Napoleon said there is a time to fight and a time to wait. So that's what we're gonna do, sergeant. We're gonna wait. Call the others. Against the wall. Stand still! - Why don't you try thinking of us! - What's the matter, Brent? Are you scared? Go on. - Sergeant! - Yes, sir. - You say you saw that man in the alarm box. - Yes sir, and he was acting suspicious. You better take four men and surround my quarters. He may escape. You know the prisoner Colonel Morrow... He's a real spy. A saboteur. He came in here in order to make way for the others. Hey! Down there! Get on down that machine gun! Come on! Ward! It's me, Ward. I've come to get you! Get that machine gun over there. Go on! Help him. Sergeant! - Place your men on the wall! - Let's go up! Come on, men. Here. Hold your fire, we surrender! Hey Brent, are you crazy? - Stop shooting, they're surrendering! - Go fuck yourselves! Good man! - Somebody has got to stop him. - Wait! - He's after Eli! - Better get there quick, Piggott. Ward! It's all over! Come on out! You're finished! Hold it, Pembroke! Now you're gonna tell me where the gold is hidden! I didn't risk my hide... just to make a hero out of you. You got to pay off, right now! Fucking...! Eli... you son-of-a... Let me remind you, Colonel. There is a military procedure for surrender. Congratulations! He was innocent. Today I have killed for the first time. And it's the last for me.
