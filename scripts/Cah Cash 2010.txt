Rooms are at 39 bucks day rate, 29 bucks overnight. - Well, it's cheaper to stay overnight. - Damn right! Days are for sex. Sex costs money. - Want a room or not? - Yes for a week, please. That will be 203 bucks in advance. It will be unit 13. Check-out at noon Thursday night. No, I'm fine. Thank you. What's up, man! Come here! Open Gate 6! - Are you alright? - Yeah. Glad you could make it, bro. What the fuck did you go to Chicago, anyway? Are there not trade back home? Their expensive lake views and corn fed American pussies, why ask? Jesus. Are you on the streets long enough again? Okay I'm here, Reese. You said you make it worth my while. Listen. Somebody is a dog track. And they think it was me. - But you are innocent. - Of course I am. The bad guys wore masks. Plus, one of them got accidentally killed by the cops. The car is getting north bound in Lower Wackier and Van Buren. I see it. - God damnit! - Shut fuck up. What the fuck happened, Reese? Fucking crooked cops getting on duty! That's what fucking happened. Bastards! Get out! Get out! Get the fuck out! He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Drop the gun! You in the truck, let me see your hands! Put them up! Let me see your hands! Get in the car. No witnesses, no money, no conviction, right? How much did they get? - These bad guys? - At least half a million. Maybe more. Okay, I'm interested. Where? I had to toss it. - Where? - Dan Ryan expressway. Asshole! Reese, what the fuck are you doing? Our money! Shut the fuck up, will you? Do you think it's still there? - It's not there. - Then where is it? Well, it landed on this guy's car, you know. A white-do. - Okay, what kind of car? - An old car. Old station wagon. Wood on the sides, you know? Yeah, wood on the sides. Shit! Fucking piss! Son of a bitch! Why me? Ten zillion fucking cars in goddamn Chicago and this motherfucker ass... Jesus Christ. You want to shower first? No, you go ahead. Okay. Don't be down, Sam. It will all work out. You want me to pick you up at work? No, I'll meet with you. The walk will do me good. - See you later, then? - Yeah. Damn! What the hell are you doing, man? Jesus Christ, Reese! Are you fucking crazy? Fucking keep it down! In Chicago, Reese. The car capital of the northern USA and you expect me to find one fucking car. - Forget it, your boy got lucky. - Listen to me. This barney came into his lock only two days ago. The trail is still hot to the street or snatch. He'll use cash and that's what set him apart from the other worker and folks. First thing he'll do is buy a new car , cash... and that's how you get him. Now split is 50-50. Are you in or out? I'm here, aren't I? I'll give my best shot. - You're the sales manager? - Yeah, that's me. Can you help me? I'm sure as hell try. If somebody comes in here and buys a car for cash... what do you do? Cream in my Calvins. What official things do you do? Well, since there is no bank, there's no loan application, no insurance, papers to fill out and no loan officer, see. But the only thing we do on a cash deal... is to document the state tax and licensing. - How? - It's a form. Here. But I got to tell you cash is rare. Once, maybe two times a year do I see a cash deal. Is this document method of payment? Right there on that line, see? You have to list the bank, the finance company ... or you stamp it "cash". - And where do this go? - Chicago DMB, Central Branch. Thank, buddy. Hey, you're welcome. You rude fucking gumbo. I can't imagine why he's late, Mr. Dale. He knew we're meeting at 10:30. I believe this is the very nature of our problem, Ms. Phelan. Buying a house is a major responsibility. I do not think Mr. Phelan is facing his commitment in a responsible manner. You and your husband are 120 days behind in payments. This constitutes serious careers to an institution of this small size. Mr. Dale, we know where we stand. We've been unemployed. We're both working now, we'll catch up. You're asking much of this institution to reschedule your loan... especially in view of Mr. Phelan's tardiness... both in legal payments and today's appointment. - Where have you been? - I'll tell later. Mr. Dale, our banker. Let me guess. You being the we any that you are, you're not going to reschedule our payments. Is that right? What? What did you say? Under the circumstances, I do not believe this institution ... can accommodate you, Mr. and Mrs. Phelan. Stop, Sam, talk to him. This is our house! I'm afraid you have to pay the full amount you owe or Midwest Savings and Loan will be force to finalize foreclosure proceedings. Mr. Dale, please. We have paid on that house... every month on time for 5 years. Doesn't that count for anything? What exactly is the full amount? With penalties and interest, comes to $7603.12. Okay. Here. and... - One, two, three ... - 12 cents. Four, five, six. You got four singles? Four. Yeah. Thank you. U.S. $ 7605. Leslie, come on. Wait, my sweater. You owe me $1.88, bastard and want it by noon tomorrow. - Where did you get it ? - Straight from heaven, baby. No, really, Sam, where? I was on the Dan Ryan expressway, right. And a police chase went by, and it just crashed onto the hood of my car. Did it dent the car? Dented? Jesus, honey, forget that. Come on. Oh my God. How much is there? I don't know. You want to find out? How much, how much? Okay. It comes to $618,127. Wait, plus $7605 we give that asshole Mr. Dale which makes... - Did you see his face? - Yeah. I thought he was going to pee in his pants when you call him a we any. How's it about when you hit him up with $1.88? - Bastard! - Bastard! Okay. Counting the $7605 we gave the bank totals... $625,731. My God! We're rich. Sam, we can't keep it. - Yes we can. - No. It's probably dirty money. Yeah, of course it is. It's cash. I don't want some Colombian drug lord kicking our door down. Hey, nobody saw it, Les. If I hadn't picked it up, it would've just laid on the ground for somebody else to find. It's free and clear money. Nobody in this world knows we have it. What it was robbed from a bank or something? So what? Banks are insured. Come on! What are we going to do? You want to play John Q dipshit citizen and turn it over to Chicago PD? Those crooks in blue, you know, they'll just steal it for themselves anyway. No, no, baby, no way. This is our money. Alright? God sent it to me right out of the sky. A million car hoods in Chicago, this suitcase hit mine. That's fate. - They would be insured, right? - Yeah, of course, they would. Come on, this is our money, baby. The mortgage is paid up. You can have all the stuff, you can finally buy. New furniture, paint the house. Well .. Leslie, over $600,000. Allows us to spend anything we want. All our dreams come true, baby. You're right! My God! - What first? - Well, there's a pretty big dent in the car. - New car! - Yeah. What will it be, man? I'm looking for Zeke. Wrong joint. No Zeke here. Come here. Come here. Back there. Thanks. I was told I could buy tools. I've got tools. What's your preference? Sears? Stanley? Snap On? I was thinking more on the lines of Ruggeri, Smith & Wesson, you know? Can I get me keys to the Motor Vehicle Department? That's two chairs, dining room set... sofa, big screen plasma TV. What about a bed? What about a bed? Bed, bed, bed ... We definitely got to have a bed, don't we? Definitely. Right this way. This is perfect. - Hi. - Hey! Okay, they'll deliver our stuff tomorrow between 1 and 4. Alright. Give me that. Very swanky. Buick. Kia, maybe. Can I help you? Yes, excuse me. Is that your Toyota? No, it's my wife's. Why? - Who is it Glenn? - I don't know who the hell he is. Who the hell are you? Excuse me. Hey motherfucker! What? You're driving around you see a nice car... - you want to get in my face and ask me one question? - What? It looked like to me your casing the joint. Get him, baby. You better get the fuck out of this neighbourhood before I bust a cop in your white boy ass. Coz you don't want this. He don't want this. - He don't want this. - No, he don't want this. Listen up, Glenn the fucking plumber. You blacks think y'all so fucking bad. Well, you aren't. You think all white people fear you. We don't. Now shut your fucking mouth... or I'll put you in the fucking emergency ward. Got it? Did you hear that accent? Yeah, isnt no regular white boy. - Come on, let's just go. - Is he Spanish? Hi. Mr. Bear shit Tenderfeet? No, no, no. Pronounce this way please ... Bahadurjit Tejinderpreet. I can helped you, please. Yeah, helped me. Nice Chevy over there. Oh yeah, my Chevrolet. Great American automobile. I like it too much. Chevrolet. Big favourite for you, Arabs, is it? Arab? That's bullshit! I'm Sikh from India! I don't make no 9/11. I make 9/9! My beautiful store! Mr. Melvin Goldberg? Who wants to know? - I'm from Bavarian Motor Works. - The what? BMW. Bavarian Motor Works. Your new car there. Yeah, well. So? I'd like to ask you a couple of questions, if you don't mind... - About your new Beemer. - No, thanks. Beat it. My company is offering $100 for a simple 5-minute interview. Yeah. Come inside. Yes! So ... How long have you had the car? Eight days. Do you like the BMW? Hell, yes. Don't everybody? Even those goddamn Mercedes fools are changing to BMW now. Aren't you going to write stuff down? I've got a good memory. How long, did you say, you finance the car? I didn't say. Why the hell do you want to know that anyhow? Just helps us to determine buying trends and sort them out. It says you paid cash. Exit! Who the hell are you? Get the fuck out of my house! Sit down. Fuck you! Get the hell out Or I'll throw your ass out. The suitcase? Where is the suitcase, Goldberg? The money. Where the fuck is it? I'm sorry, mister. I'll replace the cash, I promise. So, it was you? - Yeah? - I did it. But I'll put it back, honest to God. What do you mean? You spent it all. You spent half a million? What? - No, no ... - Talk to me Jew motherfucker. I work for Gen-Am. I stole the money. I admit it. But I did, because they are extorting the customers. They're rip offs man. They're chaining the public. I'll pay it back though, honest. Was your old car a station wagon? No way! You a cop? If you're fucking lying, I'll kill you... and I'll kill you fucking slowly. I traded a pickup truck for that BMW. A 1993 Ford F-150. Call them, mister. Yeah. I stole the money, but not with a suitcase. I used a paper bag. - Thanks. - Thank you. You're welcome. Enjoy. To the good life and the fulfilment of our wildest dreams. To my husband may he ever be so lucky. Sammy. We should do that more often. What got into us? Cash. Morning, Mr. Phelan. Good morning, Mrs. Phelan. Sleep well? Yes, I did. Ready for breakfast? Yeah. Breakfast too, huh? Indeed. Nothing is too good for Mr. Lucky, Sam Phelan. - Eat. - I will. I'm headed for the shower. Hi Mr. Sam Phelan? Yeah, you're early we weren't expecting you till noon. I doubt you are expecting me at all. You're the Chunky Chicken franchise rep, aren't you? No. Okay, I'm sorry. I thought... What can I do for you? I'd like to talk to you about your new Range Rover. I'm from the factory. Yeah, right. - It's kind of bad timing. - It will only take a minute. Yeah, okay, come on in. Just a minute though. Sure. Thank you. Take a seat. I was just about to make a coffee if you want one. No thanks. Looking to invest? Oh, yeah. My wife and I we want to start our own business. Yeah? Recently consumed cash, did you? Listen, mister, I don't have a holding time here so... Sorry. So, were you enjoying the Range Rover? What do you mean, how it handles? Stuff like that? It's great, we love it. How does it compare to your old car? That's no comparison. What was your old car? It's a Buick station wagon. Piece of crap. Was it the one with the wood on the sides? You said you're from the factory. What factory? Hey, listen... I think you better leave now. This... business you want... you're looking to invest... What? Half a million... in cash? Hey, listen, I'm actually expecting somebody, So, I got to, I got to clean up... and I'm going to have to ask you to go. I'm not leaving, Sam. What do you mean you're not leaving? Who the hell do you think you are? I'll call the police. Look, we don't smoke in this house. You have something of mine. I've never seen you before. What are you doing? Please! You can't do that, alright? Goddamn it! Stop! Stop! What is he doing? Stop him! No, no, no! Don't, don't! Okay... Hang up the phone. Go ahead, hang up. Where is my money? We have... most of it, that is. We spent some. What are you talking about? We don't have his money. Save it, Leslie. I know the truth. How much did you spend? - About $70,000, I think. - Where's the rest? Sommes here and somas in the bank. - In the bank? - Several banks, actually. Avoiding the IRS, huh? Smart. Dangerous, though. Funny how money corrupts, isn't it? Okay. Here's what we going to do. Sam... go get the rest of the cash left here in the house, okay? - Well... - Do it now. Leslie... gather up receipts. You and I, we'll talk about exactly how much you spent. You do keep receipts, don't you? $625,731. Not a bad hole. Not a bad hole at all. Okay. It's noon. Banks need time to gather up large sums of cash... So while Leslie is figuring and I'm counting... You're going to phone, Sam, and call everyone of those banks ... you put my money in... and tell them you'll be down there today to pick up that cash. You got it? What is your total? $74,316.47. It's more than the $70,000 that you said, isn't it? I guess I forgot about some of the other stuff. That's perfectly natural. Everything looks so nice too. That big-screen TV, the Range Rover. It looks really good. Thank you. So... So, $625,761 gross... minus the $ 74,316.47... equals... $551,414.53. Correct. $551,414.53... is the figure we'll concentrate on. Got to get all that house stunning cash back, right? Ready, Sam? I only got through to a couple of them. That's okay, we can call them on the way there. Let's go visit those banks. That's good. Go on. Great. Next bank. Well, that was fun, wasn't it? Leslie... Go and get your calculator. Sit down. Okay. Subtract these figures from our running total. $54,557. $13,660. $83,000. $15,236. What's that leave? $268,184.53. Where's the rest? We left some with my mother. With Mommy. Who could be safer than Mommies? You aren't being busy little bees, are you? Good job, I got here when I did. How much? $265,000. We sure trust Mommy, don't we? So, U$265,000 subtracted from our new balance of $268,184.53... leaves $3184.53. Where does that go? Low as change, right? That kind of money goes for candy, cigarettes, that kind of stuff, right? We don't smoke. No? That's too bad. You don't mind if I smoke in the house, do you? Thank you very much. Alright, let's get back to business. We will add this $3184.53 the $74,316.47 deficit... We'll already have less the money you spent before I got here, right? That comes to what? $77,501. It's been a long day. I'm hungry. Leslie, why don't you slip into the kitchen and cook us up a nice meal? That way, we don't have to go out anymore. We'll all stay together. Isn't that something nice? Go on. Very good, Leslie. I liked it. But what was it? Eggplant, tofu and veggie steaks. Veggie steaks? We don't eat red meat. Why not? Scared to get mad cow disease? Alright. I think I'll go and watch a little big-screen TV. Then we all better turn in. Going to look brighter now with your granny tomorrow. You're sleeping with us? Is that an invitation? You know what I mean. Yes, I know. You can sleep on the couch. Thanks. What have you got us into? - Me? - Yes. Now you point the finger. That's funny. You didn't mind spending it yesterday. I'm calling the police. Put the phone down. Put the phone... Give me that! Stop it! Give it to...! Look, let's just weigh it out. Okay, if we call the cops now, they'll ask questions, lots of questions. That'd be trouble and we'll lose what little we have left. Tomorrow he'll be gone, we still have all the stuff we bought. Those are pretty cool stuff. It's not so bad. No, that is what I was afraid of. I wish you never found that goddamn money. Let's just go to sleep, okay? - Hi, Mom. - Hi, honey. Mom, you know that carton we left with you? We need it back. Honey, you said you needed it kept safe. I hid it, dear. That's fine Mom, but we need it back now. Really, sweetie, it couldn't be safer than where it is. What couldn't be safer? Well, whatever is in the box, of course. Go and get it. Mom, please, go get the box. Who the hell do you think you are? I'm one of those people you'll never meet... as long as you're a straight and honest citizen. Now, what would you have done if we turned the goddamn money over the police? But you didn't, did you, Sam? So there's no way of ever knowing that. Hey, come here. Give it to me. You took some, didn't you, Mommy? - How much did you steal? - Hey come on, that's enough. I didn't steal a cent. - I just borrowed a little. - Mother. How much did you borrow? About $600. It was a loan! I needed it! I'm on fixed income. I was going to put it back! Mother, we left that with you for safekeeping. I just took a little peek, honey. There was so much. It wasn't yours! Well, it wasn't yours either, was it? Here's a lesson... when it comes to cash, nobody can be trusted. Like mother, like daughter. Switch the engine off and give me the key. Stay put. Both of you . Sam, what are we doing? Sam, what are we doing? I don't know, Les, alright. I don't even know what we should be doing. Do we even have a right here? I don't know anymore. Of course we have no right. He's forcing us to do something against our will. Yes, he do, huh. Coz we are the ones who took the money you know, we decided to keep it. We knew it wasn't ours. Hi, there. I'm just checking out. You owe me $58. We don't give no refund. What? No refunds. I paid you $203 for seven days, at $29 a day. I only stayed five days. You owe me $58 for the two days I won't be staying. What, you got shit in your ears, mister? I said no goddamn refund! Now get on down the road before I call the cops. Next, I'll break your arms, your leg... and finally your neck. Now... just count all the money you owe me... and hand it over. Maybe forgetting something. What? You want a receipt? My day. What about my day? Have a nice day? Good. I will. - Thank you. - Same to you. Okay. Let's go. Leslie? Okay... I need to go back out. But I need you both to stay in the house. Can I trust you to do that? Yes. Did you see the blood on his shirt? He took out a guy in that motel today. He's crazy. We got to call the police. We should have called it yesterday. We can do it tonight after he's asleep. I found them. How fucking nice work, bro. I recovered $547,433. That's fucking brilliant, Pyke. Fuck me! There's more of it. Really? How much? - Some $78,298 still outstanding. - Where is it? They spent it. That's okay, fuck you. We still got $250k a piece, right? No. I'm going after the rest. What do you mean? Come on, bro. Give me a fucking break! Please, just this once. - They spent it, bro, it's gone. - It's not gone. It's just be misplaced. I'll get it replaced. Okay. Have it your fucking way. As usual. Do what you fucking like. I'll see you when I get out of this shithole. Let's talk about the rest of the money you owe. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? We spent the rest, right, it's gone. And now we have to get it back. The outstanding deficit is $78,298. What? Why don't you just take the Range Rover, take the new furniture, take it all? I don't want your goods, Sam. I'm not a merchant. I'm more like a banker. I require cash. We don't have $78,000l! $78,298. We don't have that, either. You know what? Can't you just leave? You have $500,000 plus. Just leave us alone! We're sorry we spent some. We felt God smiled down on us. We were wrong. We're sorry. Nothing is free, Leslie. Not in this life. You knew that money wasn't yours. And you spent it. Now you have to pay. What are you going to do? Kill us? We don't have it! Let's not discuss consequences. Let just focus on how you're going to get my money back. Good food, Leslie. Better if it was meat, but good all the same. Sam cooked it. Real domestic, yeah, Sam? Okay, there's something I need you both to do for me now. What's it? I need both of your personal cell phones. Get it. Thank you. Leslie, could you go to the kitchen and ring your phone, please? Yeah. I noticed another jack. Where does that one lead? In the bedroom. Can you bring the phone from the bedroom, Leslie? - Yes - Thanks. We're coming to the tricky part of this recovery action here. And I want to keep it private, don't you? We're getting to a place now where you and Leslie... have to dig into your own pockets. And you know when that happens people want to make call to somebody. Strange thing. Human nature, I guess. They always want to make that call. Now, why don't you two tell me your plan in getting the rest of my money? We don't have a damn plan. We can sell the Range Rover, it's worth about $ 70,000... sell new furniture and I don't know, borrow the rest from friends. Just to borrowing from friends, good luck. The Range Rover, okay. But the furniture, no, it takes too long. I'm giving you five days from right now. And if we can't do it by then? No consequences in advance. You learn consequences only when a line is crossed... and a decision is made. Oh yeah. It's in pretty decent shape. - I'll give 47 for it. - What? Wait a second, what are you talking about? We paid almost $70,000 a week ago, cash. Yeah, yeah. No. You see, I sold you a new vehicle and you brought me back a used one. It's only got 190 miles on it, for Christ's sake. Tell you what I'm going to do, and it's my best deal ever. I'll give you $53,000 for it and I'll throw in the old car for you. How does that sound, huh? Can you deliver it in cash? So $ 53,000 from $78,298... leaves an outstanding deficit of $25,298. Can't you just give us a goddamn break? Do you mean, I'll assume your debt? The answer is no, I won't. Look, we can't get any more. You still own a house. God dam nit, Leslie! You are not getting our house, bastard! I don't want your house, Leslie. I was thinking more along the lines of... cash refinancing. No. Not our house. Will we stop this crap now? This shit has gone far enough! Sam, this fucker is full of shit! What can he do in broad daylight? Let's just get out, Sam, walk away. Get out the damn jalopy. Leslie, you make a decision now... and you live with the consequences after, remember that? Fuck you. It is an idle threat, Sam. That's all, he's bullshit! Get in the car, Leslie. - He's bluffing. - Get in the car. He's a damn bully. We can walk away. - Let's go. - Let's call the police. Where? Where the house is financed. Mr. and Mrs. Phelan, is it your wish that this gentleman be privy... to your personal financial affairs? Yeah, sure. Why the hell not? What was the original purchase price of the house? The original purchase price was $200,000. Purchased when? Five years ago. What is the amount of their monthly payment? $647.70 a month. Term of loan? How much down? Well, 10%, $20,000. So, if down payment being the same as equity... they day they bought the house that's $20,000 equity... - And still have that amount today, yeah? - Well, yes, technically, yes. They've been paying monthly payments, faithfully... for the last five years... which comes to $38,862, right? That's correct. So, discounting interest, they've paid down about $13,000... and a mortgage debt, is that right? Yes. That's just about right, yes. So they still owe $167,000. Now, during these past five years, the property has appreciated. Well, yes, of course. But we can't be certain on how much without an appraisal. Yeah, nevertheless, it has appreciated. Let's use a conservative figure, say $20,000 over five years. That sums easily to what? $4,000 per year. I would say that's optimistic would you? No, that sounds reasonable. Okay. So, discounting appreciation with their original down payment... they have $53,000 equity in the house. And as such, I see no reason why this institution... should not lend them a $25,298 they seek... less than half their existing equity. Well, I... We quit our jobs. - You're unemployed? - Yeah. Are you familiar with the Newer Dock Home Equity Loan? Yeah, of course. Yeah? You see, the Newer Dock requires no employment, no income or assets. Lenders do not verify any information beyond the credit profile - and value of the property. - Of course. The Phalanx have equity. They could easily get a loan equal to 80%. Well, I don't know that this bank has ever issued a New Dock loan. I don't know that we can do it. Their credit rating... Listen... I think you're missing a big opportunity here, Mr. Dink. It's Dale. - Mr. Dale. - Yeah, whatever. We could go elsewhere for the money... and I'm sure your branch manager would be very unhappy to lose a business... especially in view of the fact that this institution... holds the first mortgage. But it's urgent. These people need the cash today. Name your terms. At today's prices, they have more equity than necessary... more money for the bank if you decide to foreclose, you get me what I mean here? It's a sweet deal. There might even be a promotion in it, somebody... Perhaps, I could consider a small home equity loan... you know, for urgent home repairs. High interest. Well, of course. Well... we take the fair market value... times 80% loan to value... and equals $86,000... minus the compound interest over the term of the loan. I can lend $11,421.89. That's the maximum on a pure equity loan of an unemployed applicant. They'll take it. Make a bank draft to cash. They'll redeem it here. So, Sam... how are you going to get the remaining $13,876.11? Why are you keeping me at this? The money isn't even yours anyway. That's where you're wrong The money is mine... and I will keep it until a superior power takes it from me. And so the question remains. How will you pay me the $13,876.11 that you owe me? There's your fucking Thank you, Leslie. Why can't you just leave us alone? I understand your frustration... I do... but I must have the full amount. We don't have it and there's no place else we can get it. So, you're just going to have to kill us or whatever it is... Slow down. Look, everybody's overreacting. Let's just all settle down, okay? We'll have a nice meal, we'll watch some big-screen TV... and in the morning, we'll work something out. You still have another four days. Les? Les, come on, wake up. Wake up, wake up. - What? - We're leaving. C'mon, get dressed. Here. - What? - Let's go. - He'll hear. - Fuck him. Come on. - Let's go, let's go. Come on. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Out for a midnight stroll? I understand this is your first experience in a situation like this... So I'm go to overlook tonight in discretion. But understand this. Until I get my money, you will not leave this house. You will not phone anyone or meet anyone... unless I give my permission. Is that understood? - Is that understood? - Yes. Leslie? Yes, fucking yes! Okay? Now get back to bed. Good morning. Everybody sleep well? What the hell is this? I did a little shopping while you people are sleeping. Meat. Why don't you slip over to the stove there, Sam, and cook up some eggs and meat for Leslie and me? What? Eggs, Sam. I want eggs. Are you going to cook or not? - I'll do it. - No. I want Sam to do it. He's a domestic man, aren't you Sam? What are you doing? Stop it. I just want him to do. That's all, Leslie. This is ridiculous. It's the elementary school crap! What's it going to be, Sam? Whatever. Eggs, no big deal. And meat, Sam. Make mine scrambled will you? How do you like your eggs, Leslie? Fuck you. It's easy for a woman, isn't it? No physical threat, without fear of reprisal. You can just simply open your big beautiful mouth... and say whatever foul things that comes into your head, right? Come, sit by me. Sam. Go in there and rob it. Bring me the money back. - Wait, what? - Are you crazy? Hey, I can't do that! Shit! Get on the way, you can do it, Sam. You'll be surprise how easy it is. You see, the majority of men are cowards, isnt that right, Sam? All women are cowards. Fear of this gun will drive them to obey every command... just as you obey mine. Now, get in there and do it. Running time for my orders, Sam. I want my fucking money. - Now, go in there and do it. - Alright, alright. Just relax. Sam? Your phone. Fuck. Hello? Sam, it's me. I want you to keep the line open. I want to hear everything that's going on in there, you understand? If you get ugly, the line goes dead, your wife goes dead with it, you understand? Yeah. Give me all the money! Paper or plastic? Jesus Christ, I don't care! Fuck you! Fuck you! It's good, isnt it? Give me the gun, Sam. Count the money for him, Leslie. He seems a little nervous. Let's see how you did, Sam. How much, baby? $464. $464. That's not a great score, Sam. Why didn't you get the coins? What do you mean, I didn't get the coins! I didn't I'm supposed to! Now, you got that from the movies, right? That's what stupid movies get you. Money is money. You get it all. Okay. That's $464, subtracted from... the balance of $13,876. that comes to $13,412... left to get. Your turn. Not me. Why? Because you're a woman? The vagina gives you special privileges, does it? You, American women always want equality. Well, I'm giving it to you. And get the change this time. Leslie? Same deal. You get killed in there and Sam he pays the price. Okay? Got it. Raise your hands! Give me the money, asshole! Come on, come on! Put it in a bag! The coins too! Come on! And give me a pack of cigarettes. What kind? - I don't care, the green ones. - Menthol? Just give me a goddamn carton! Get on the floor! Get down and don't move for 5 minutes or you die! Give me the gun. Physical power over others tastes sweet in the mouth. Especially for a woman... who doesn't often get the experience. Feeds you like mother's milk. It's almost sexual, isn't it Leslie? Hey, where did you get those? I took them. Oh, you shoplifted. Shoplifted? Okay, count all the money, Leslie. $525.87. My haul was bigger. Leslie? The day's total haul is $2128.16. Subtracted from our outstanding total leaves... $11,283.84. Isnt no great shape, folks. $2,100 for a whole day's work. Actually, it's $2128.16. Turn on the TV, Sam. It's time for the news. Go. You're watching WGN, News at 9. Sit by me, Leslie. Armed robberies occurred today in the Chicago area. Two men and one woman held up a liquor store this morning... and escaped capture. Police believed it's the same trio... that went on to rob six more convenience store in an all day crime spree. Police estimates, the robbers got away with over $10,000. That's bullshit! There was a lie about the take. Insurance fraud. Everybody's crooked. Everybody. Police have compiled the sketch of the trio. Isn't that stupid? Those drawings never looked like anybody. In the history of the world, they've never caught a criminal based on those stupid things. Bahadurjit Tejinderpreet... who has been robbed more than ten times. I know that guy. Bear shit Tenderfeet. I've been robbed by the best thieves in Chicago! These are amateurs! Fuck him! The getaway car was a cream-colored station wagon, believed to be a Buick. Shit! In other news... - They know our car. - They don't know anything. They got no license number, no photos, no names. Detroit made ten zillion of those cars. Relax. Anyway, Tomorrow, we'll use my car. You're sideling up to side. I'm not sideling. - You sat beside him, Les. - You cooked his meat. Sam, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're both scared of him and we have a right to be. He's dangerous. He's crazy and he's making us crazy. I'm so sorry. Empty the register, man. Let's go! Come on, hurry up, hurry up! Don't do anything stupid. Getting the hang of it, Sam. Give me the gun. - What kind of gun is this? - The kind that scares people. Now give me. But what kind? It's a Star Caliber 9mm, Parabellum, semi-automatic... pistol double action. Made in Spain. It weighs 39.68 ounces and has a 4-inch barrel. It fires a 120 gray... metal jacketed bullet at a mussel velocity of 1247 ft/sec. Okay, now give me the fucking gun. I said give me the fucking gun. Nine millimetre. Sam, what's happening to us? I watched you today. You liked that gun. Jesus. Shut up, Leslie. - Sammy! - No, shut the fuck up. Get the money! I can't! Family needs more money! Get the fucking money now! No! Goddamn you! That girl's a natural, Sam. Let's go! Don't say one fucking word to me! Totals out to $5295.52. It's not bad at all. But we still have an outstanding balance of $5988.32 and only one day left. Turn on the TV, Sam, it's time for the news. Why don't you turn it on yourself? Okay, Sam. The threesome struck again today, robbing ten different establishments... in Cook County. Ten in one day! It could be a record. Captain Johnson said he's never seen such a desperate run of robberies. The getaway car they're using now is a black Lincoln, with no license plate. If caught, the two men and one woman... face armed robbery charges... which carries a 20 to 50-year prison term. Actually... when Leslie pistoled the old chink, she'll be answered to robbery with aggravated assault... It is life. I made you do it, but I didn't mean you like it, did I? I wasn't me who made your panties wet... when you were robbing those people was it Leslie? Fuck you, alright! I will not let you do that! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop hitting him, stop it! Stop it! Stop it, no! Come on. You okay? Get the fuck out of here! What do you think? Grab my pistol so you could get my gun? What? Are you offended I rejected you offering your pussy? Get back to bed, Leslie. We can start downtown... and make our way south to Cicero. No. One more score. We'll hit a bank. Too risky. The banks are out of your league. That kind of job requires preparation, planning. Gets another layout of routines. This will be alright, son. The bank I'm thinking about, I know everything I need to know. We'll stick to the small stuff.. What's the matter? Isnt you got the stomach for it? I want to finish with this shit. I'll never get a full $5988.32 taken to the small stuff. Or you'll give a time extension, is that it? You're giving me a pass? Okay, Sam. You get your bank. What? You got any clean pantyhose? Banks are two-man job. I'm going in there with you. We got no longer than three minutes, okay. Leslie, you keep the monster running and stay cool. No more games, or Sam he pays the price. A little late for fucking games. Let's go. Robbery! Get down! Everybody! Nobody fucking moves. Once you play hero, you're killed. Get on the fucking ground! Everybody! - Bag all the money! - Yes, sir! Bag it up! Nobody moves! Open the bolt! Stand still there! No one fucking left here. You, get down! Go down the stairs! Don't fucking move! Come on, move it! Fucking get down! Leave the money and run. The alarm has been triggered. You'll go to prison. What the fuck are you doing? Move, now! You fucking stay down! Come out ! Come out! Get off! How much did we get? Are you fucking crazy? What the fuck did you just do? We owe $5988.32. Here it is. Now, are we done with it? That's right, Sam. Our business is finished. Give me the gun. I said, give me the gun. Give me that fucking gun, Sam, or I'll leg really fucking badly this time. You believe me? Yeah, I believe. You don't got the stomach for that. You don't have any idea what the fuck I have the stomach for. Sam! What do you hope to accomplish with no fucking bullets, you buddy folk? Sammy! If you make a move here, I'll get down and I'll kill you. - Believe me? - Yeah. - You believe, motherfucker? - Yeah, I believe. Goddamn right you do. What's your name? - What? - Your name. I want to know your fucking name. Pyke. Pyke? Pyke what? Cubic. Pyke Cubic. Watch out! Go! I'm going to kill you both! - I'm going to kill you both! - Fuck you! - Take the gun, Les! - Fuck you! Fuck you! A bizarre incident was reported by police today. Over $15,000 has been anonymously returned... over 27 convenience stores, with over $10,000 returned to a Park and Savings Bank... in repayment for the rush out robberies that occurred last week. It appears, the robbers experienced remorse and sent... the exact amount of stolen cash back to each establishment. The robbers even sent extra money to two persons... who were hurt during the course of the crime: An older Asian woman and a savings and loan manager.
