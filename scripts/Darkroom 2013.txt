I'm Michelle. You brought me here. You drove me. Yeah, Darkroom? I got your card from Rachel Lefferson. She's a therapist at... Oh, yeah, Rachel. Rehab center. Right. Parents gone. Any other living relatives? No. What about school? They took away my aid after the accident and the court order. I'm gonna come to the point, Michelle. You're eligible to leave with my signed approval. But you'll stay indefinitely until I give you a good review. If you want to get out of here, you have to prove it. Someone call for a ride? Yeah. Thank you. No problem. So, where to? The address is 1040 Millview Lane. Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. Just... nothing. Do you mind if I ask what happened? To your leg? It doesn't matter. I'm sorry, my mouth goes too fast sometimes. And then what happened? I woke up in the hospital, and I had never felt that pathetic. Oh, God, my brother. How could I have... He's gone. Thank you, Jean. Takes a lot of courage. The process has begun. You've started on the course of penitence. And you'll find peace. I know you will. Michelle, have you decided to share your experience with the group? How about it? No? Well, we're here, I guess. Michelle! You can pull around back. Nancy will take care of you. Yeah, she'll be doing your hair and wardrobe. I thought I was just doing some PA/gopher stuff. Not today, I had a model drop out. That's okay, right? It's the same pay. Oh, you want me to model? Hmm. What exactly is this for? It's for print fashion shots for a real estate periodical. Real exciting stuff, huh? Well, I've never done this before. Ah. Don't worry. I'll take good care of you. I'll see you in a bit? Hey, there. I'm Daniel. I've seen you around. Michelle. I work here, odds and ends. Yeah, I've seen you. You ready for the bad news? We're not allowed to smoke here. I've heard. Shit. Thought I was enlightening you. Hmm. Well, I'll see you around. Yeah. Thanks for the ride. Sure thing. Give a call if you need a ride back. Okay. Thanks. Hi, you must be Michelle! Uh, yeah. It's me. You find it okay? Okay, come on, come on, let's get started. This place is amazing! Does someone actually live here? It's for sale. Come along. No time for today. Place is huge. Larry wants to start in the study, then move to the backyard. I think the weather is gonna hold up just fine. You need to use the little girl's room? Uh, no, I'm fine. All right, let's get started. Larry likes to keep his schedule. Could you take off your jewelry? My, you are very lovely. Thank you. Am I hurting you? No. Ooh, so sorry. Did I hurt you? Pretty, pretty. Okay, outfit, outfit. Larry said that this was some sort of real estate shoot? It's like a PR shoot. You just have to smile and be yourself. Here we go. Yeah, this looks like your size. You'll look great. Oh, and, uh... Put these on and I'll give you some privacy. The reason I'm not in school anymore is because, um... I was in an accident. You can do it, Michelle. You can be purged and free of your past. Come on. I was driving. And Trey was... He was my boyfriend. We were arguing. He was distracting me. It wasn't my fault. Is that it? Yep. Knock, knock. Excellent, Larry is gonna be so pleased. So, the study is down the hall. This way, you make a right. It's the last room. My parents died when I was 14. And I just moved around from foster home to foster home... Until I realized I was better off on my own. My dad died when I was young, too. Makes it hard to trust people. You know, I felt better when I talked. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean to upset you. I just... I can't talk about this anymore. You're so lucky to be leaving this dump. Remember, you gotta talk about what got you into here, Michelle. It's the only way out. You got no other choice. See ya. Hello? Nancy? Can I, uh... Can I talk to you? Jean got here after I did. Why am I still here? Jean was an active participant in this community. When you participate, then you can go, too. But I just want to move on with my life. Well, I find that very offensive. I'd say you have plenty of issues to work out here. Hello! Nancy! Larry? Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Larry? Nancy? Hello. Shit! Oh, my God! Hello? Is anyone there? Please answer me. Come get me, Rachel. Oh, careful! Boys, play nice. Play nice. Boys, be sweet, be sweet. Come on, Daniel. Is your name... No. I can't pick it up... It's not working. Here, you try. Amy! Oh, my God. Hey! What the fuck is this? Let me out! Come on! What do you want from me? Come on! No! This is your key and the address where you're gonna be living. Work is really a big part of the rehabilitation process. Do you have any thoughts? I'll see what comes. I do want you to stay off the street. I wouldn't want you to end up some kind of dirty girl. What's this? Larry's a friend. He sometimes has opportunities for our girls. I'll let you finish up here. Hello? Hello, you fucks! Hey! Oh, fuck! Fuck you! Hello? You fuckers! Cheers. And another. Well, if you act like a dick, I'm gonna keep going at it. Look, stop lecturing me. Oh, you're such an asshole. Get over here! Get over here! Hey! Hey! What? Watch your hands. You're twisting her arm. And how is that any of your business? I'm making it my business, all right? Stay out of it! Oh, my God! Yo, why don't you take control of your girlfriend. Uh, you know what? Fuck you. No, fuck you! No! It's not my fault. Help! Get out of here! Hello? Is anyone there? Hi. So, you're leaving us. Finally. You must feel good. Uh... Yeah, I mean, as good as it can feel. I still got some shit to work out, though. You'll do fine. Hey. I brought you something. What? Thought you could think of me when you smoke them. You know, uh, maybe we could... I have some additional forms for you. Daniel, I thought that you needed to pack up the art supplies? Yeah, I'm on it. Good luck out there. No! Oh, my God! Please help me! - Let me out of here! - Quiet! What is this about, okay? Let me out! Shut your mouth! Have a seat. Have a seat in a chair! Let's begin. Confess. Confess, my child. I confess. What do you confess? I was wrong. Oh. Praise God. The purging has begun. Been a naughty girl, haven't you? Haven't you? Say it. I've been a naughty girl. You're a slut! A Goddamn whore. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Please! No! Confess. You have to confess. Huh? No! Let me out! Let me out! Hey! Shut your mouth. Oh, my God! How is this my fault? I was trying to protect you. Look, I don't need your protection. Guys, it's done, relax! No, no, no, the night's over, I just... Done. Okay. What would you have done to that guy? Oh, shit! Michelle, should you be driving? I am fine, okay? It's my ride, my rules. Let go of me. No! Stay the fuck away from me! What do you want with me? Stay the fuck away from me! No! I told you she was a dirty girl. You bitch! The Lord hates a crude tongue. Patience, sister. No! Welcome to my little fun house. Isn't that right, Daniel? We had so much fun here as kids. Why are you doing this to me? I didn't do anything to you. We got plenty of time to answer that question. Fuck you! What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What is wrong with you? You put me in a very bad position. I can't keep protecting you. Stop it. Daniel knows his role. He better know his role. This is your responsibility to teach him. We can't take care of him forever. I have work to do. Go be eyes and ears. Don't ever talk that way in front of him again. Know your place. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is someone there? Yes. Who is this? My name is Jean Balfour. Jean? Oh, my God, it's Michelle. Michelle. Oh, my God. We gotta get out of here. These people are nuts. Um... Is there anything in your room? Anything at all? Just a chair. I'm wearing some stupid green dress. My God, I think they're gonna kill us. They're not gonna kill us. We're gonna get out of this room. How? I don't know. I just... I need to think. Oh, God! Oh, God. Michelle! Michelle, help! Wait, what are you... Wait! What are you doing? Oh, no, no, no, no! Please! Please! Leave her alone! No! Stop it! Let her go! Jean! Hey! Jean! Hello? God! Sweetheart. I have something for you. Not so fast. You have to sing for your supper. Give me the food, bitch. Tsk, tsk. The Lord hates a crude tongue. Now let's remain lady-like, shall we? Shall we leave you in the dark? No, no, no just... I'm sorry. I'm just really hungry. Shut up! Now do as I say. Go to chair and sit. Who's a dirty girl? Who's a dirty girl? Please just tell me what you want me to do. Who's a dirty girl, you little slut? Me. Me! Mmm... We gotta get out of here, okay? Easy, easy. Okay. Help me. Please don't leave. You have to help me, okay? I wish... You can make it. Go. I can't go. I can't go! Go. Michelle... I can't go! Go. I'm sorry. You can make it. You can make it. You left me there, Michelle. Lauren. It wasn't my fault, Lauren. Help, please! I was worried they put too much medicine in your food. My brother and sister are angry, that's all. I need to... I need to get up. Here, I can help. What is it? You sniff this. It'll make the nightmares go away. Feel better? Mmm... Do you want to see my scar? I saw yours and that's how I knew we would be friends. I haven't shown this to anyone, but we have a real connection I got this a long time ago. That's right, Daniel. We have a connection. You want to be friends, right? We need to help each other get out of here, together. I don't think that can happen. That's between Larry and Rachel. We can stay here, though. You people are fucking crazy! Don't call me that. That is not nice. This is our funhouse, like my brother said. Daniel? Larry, please. I was just... You see what you've done to him? Michelle... Wakey-wakey. Since you bullied my brother... Now I'm gonna bully you. I didn't bully him. Choose. I don't want to. Choose or you get both. Hmm? Okay. Michelle? No! Larry, she's getting away! Larry! Help me! Don't go! Please, come back. No! Just wait till your sister gets home, you moron! All right, little girl. There's no way out! Help! Help me, please! Help me. Okay. Help. What did he do? He helped one of them with food. She's in the ceiling... Like a little bitch. A little rat bitch! But he's sorry now. Right, Daniel? You can turn around. I'll get the whore. Don't bother. She can't escape. I made sure. She'll be down soon enough. There's someone down the hallway who needs your attention. Oh, yeah, right. Oh, my God. Is that Jean? Jean. I don't get it, Daniel. What's gotten into you? Is it the new whore? Is it her dirty body? Parts? I could cut them off? Give them to you as an early birthday present? No, Larry. That's not... Honestly, Daniel, I sometimes despair for your soul. Are you worried about this? You don't need to worry about this. It's for the dirty sinners. Are you a dirty sinner, Daniel? No, you're no sinner. You're the most innocent of us. Too innocent, hmm? A little pain to remind you of what's important. We're family, Daniel. It's all about the family, hmm? I love you. Jean? Okay. Come on. Come on. Larry! Tickle Rachel. Tickle Daniel! Tickle Daniel! Daniel! Be nice, boys! Play nice. Play nice. Now children, who has sinned? We have, Mother. And who needs to be purged? We all need purging. Remember that. What were you doing in your room, Daniel? Nothing, Mother. Idle hands are the Devil's playground. You were looking at these comics again, weren't you? Is this a funhouse? Do you know what God told King David in the Bible? He said, "Fear not. And show courage." "For your Father is with you always." Your superheroes act bravely, Daniel. It's what makes them special. You're a little coward, aren't you? Open your shirt. Mother, please! Open your shirt! Now! Now! Open. Oh, my God. What are you telling me? I started to bleed. From your private area? I hoped you wouldn't be touched by this. But you're a dirty little girl. Say it! What are you? A dirty girl. I can't hear you. A dirty girl! A dirty girl. Thankless child... You were supposed to put together Mother's table. You didn't do it right. Mother got hurt. I'm sorry, Mother. That's all right. But I think you know God's law. What is it? An eye for an eye. I'm sorry, my child. This is painful for me as well, but you made your bed. Now you have to lie in it. Mother, no! Oh, my God. Ugh! You have to confess. Are you a sinner? Are you a sinner? No. I am not a sinner. Hmm? But you are a sinner. And you must confess your sins in order to be free. I am a sinner. I want you to say it louder, so you can get purged. I am a sinner. Louder. I am a sinner. Louder. I am a sinner. Louder. I am a sinner... Jean. Jean! Jean! You're gonna be okay! Oh, my God. Come on, baby. Come on! Come on! We're gonna go. You're making it. I can't do... Back pocket! Michelle! Ssh... You've been a very bad girl. But everything's gonna be okay now. I'm gonna get the dirty girl back to normal. Pretty girl. Ssh. Mommy loves you. You are one resourceful girl. Shoes are important. Usually we take much longer. Seeing it takes time to purge. But since you messed up our schedule with your stunt. Choose. Choose, or you get both. Time to purge. Praise the Lord. I knew from the first moment I saw you, how rotten you were. Confess. When your mother tells you to do something, you do it! I confess. For what? For killing my friends. Not your dirty whore friends. I'm talking about me. What do you confess to me? The dirty girl just doesn't get it, does she? Apparently not. We'll be back. Don't go anywhere. I have a new friend to attend to. Handle this. Come here. You know what to do. I'll be there in a few minutes. You really messed up. I wanted to be friends. Why couldn't you do it? When we met, I was nice to you... Because I thought you were special. I thought you would understand me. And then I saw your scar... And I knew we had a real connection. Larry? Hi. Kristen, right? Yeah, you said, uh, 2:00. I did, you know, it's the darnedest thing. We had a scheduling problem with yesterday's model. I know, I know, it's such a bummer. Do you think we could reschedule tomorrow? No, but Mother always said, you can't trust a pretty girl. I know that now. No, please! Oh, don't be such a coward! A baby! No, let me tell you, Mother! No, let me tell you, Daniel. Let Mother speak. You know what I always say. That courage is the most important thing. And that what makes a superhero special, is their bravery. And you've been very brave. You've proven that you could stand up to Mother and be your own man. I'm so sorry, Daniel! Now come, give Mother a hug. I may have to work tomorrow. I was really psyched about getting the photos today. I promise I'll pay you double and we'll give you extra shots. Huh? Just for being such a sweetheart? I'm so sorry. Okay. Thanks, Kristen. Tomorrow, I promise you, a shoot you'll never forget. No! Daniel... Rachel! Rachel! The Lord is my shepherd. And I shall not want. He leadeth me to the soul... I'm with you. Are you okay? Huh? Okay. Let's go this way.
