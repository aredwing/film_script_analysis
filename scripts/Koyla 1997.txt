Shankar's loyalty outweighs.. .. the combined loyalty of my dogs. Bravo! Wow, Shankar! Hats off to you! - You've got to appreciate him! Who instilled courage in him? Rajasahib! Who transformed a weakling into a man of steel? Rajasahib! There's chaos! The labourers have stopped working in the coal mines. Why? Has a fire broken out in the mines? Your younger brother is inflamed with anger. He is badly thrashing a labourer. Don't beat my father! Leave him! No! Don't beat him! He will die! Let go of him! Please do not beat my father! Stop it!.. I ask, what's happening, Brijwa? Brother, she was walking with a pot on her head. I liked her, so I caught her hand. Why did you raise your hand on your beloved brother? He's been crazy since childhood. - Shut up! Listen carefully, Brijwa! The daughters of all the workers are like my own children. I am the king; they are my subjects! After the Lord, they look upon me as their God! Go away! Wow! Fantastic! I have witnessed justice similar to that given.. .. during the regime of Emperor Jehangir! Where a brother has hit a brother! When Brijwa was being slapped, I was deeply anguished! If I am lying, then may the mad dogs of the village.. .. bite anybody! I was having `Zarda Gopal Gold'. My words are real bold! Glory be to.. - Rajasahib! Glory be to.. - Rajasahib! I am Mr. Tol Mol. Talking in riddles.. .. and divulging secrets, is what I do! What rubbish are you talking? I am talking about the history of this village. Since ages, man has been buying women. Look, there goes the old man! He's giving tablets to the old men to revitalize them! Stupid man! Who called me? He's calling you by your real name. You are stupid, and I'm your son! Hey, why are you indulging in buffoonery with this puppet? Look at how I'm carrying on the ancestral profession of a physician! By fleecing the rich! Shut up! - Excuse me, boost my spouse's power. Power? She's talking about the power of the tablets.. ..you had given the last time. Yes, those tablets were ineffective. Yes. - Really? Watch, I'll give you such potent tablets this time that.. Father, why are you destroying their lives? I am igniting the flames of youth in them. No, you are not. You are igniting wet sticks in the rain! Only smoke will be emitted! - Why? Because you are playing a `sitar' with a broken string! Is that so? The `sitar' is completely out of order! This model will not work.. am I right, madam? You are right. I'm trapped. Hey, will you just keep on talking? Have you had something or not? I'm giving them something to eat. You serve them the drinks. Give it to me. The party is on, but where is Rajasahib? Sir, what's this? You caused me to beat my Brijwa. So I shall slice you apart now. But your brother molests our daughters.. Quiet! The moment your child is conceived in the womb. It becomes my slave! I shall do what I please! I'll use your wife, daughter and daughter-in-law, the way I want to! They are my property! No, sir. I will protest! I surely will! Feed him to the animals. What are you doing here? What did you see? You didn't see? What did you see?.. Answer! What did you see? What did you see? Answer! What's this? He's seen something but isn't divulging it.. Answer! Has he ever spoken a word? Do the mountains ever speak? One needs a voice to speak. Where will this lad get it from? This poor lad is mute. I know that he is mute, but he has witnessed it. Ask him! Brijwa, I am illiterate. But I have been reading this mute lad's eyes since childhood. He has not seen anything. Go, Shankar. You've had a lot to drink today. I have been intoxicated enough by wine, secretary. Today, I shall get inebriated by drinking in your beauty. You always talk this way when you get drunk. The Creator has made you so beautiful. Then, why do you wear clothes? Remove them! I shall admire you. You behave like you have never seen it before. Hey, this is the miracle of the Creator! Hey, guard! May you be damned! I've been visiting this place since 20 years.. ..and you fire bullets at me! I have Rajasahib's orders to shoot. Hey, Rajasahib cannot live without the pills which I give him. If your bullet accidentally hits me, then you'll surely be dead! If Rajasahib won't kill you, then Brijwa certainly will. What are you doing? Hey, why are you screaming? - Rajasahib, you have no enemy. Then why do you need these dogs and guards? Look.. ..greed and enmity can arise anytime, anywhere. After all, I'm a king. I should have a lifestyle befitting one! It's the Deputy Inspector General's phone. Yes? - You are coming, aren't you? I will surely attend your daughter's wedding. It's pronounced as wonderful. Yes, that's what I said. What's the matter? You are not looking her in the eye today. Hey, you haven't left me worthy of doing that! You gave me a tablet which put me to sleep at night again! I got humiliated once again in front of my secretary. It isn't the fault of the tablet. Then whose fault is it? - The model's. Where will I get a better model than her in this age? Open your eyes and look around. The Lord has created many more beautiful models! Gauri, I.. Hey, Gauri! Listen! Hey, what have you done? - I've eaten `laddoos'. Yes! Those sweets contained a drug. You will be doomed! `Laddoo' made of Indian hemp? - `Laddoo' made of Indian hemp? We are doomed! Hey, everything will appear topsy-turvy! It does appear topsy-turvy. It will give you a high! - It has! "Stop!" "We've united under the influence of Indian hemp." "We've united under the influence of Indian hemp." "We've moved forward, leaving grief behind." "Come on.. let's make life miserable for everyone." "We've united under the influence of Indian hemp." "Water? How did this happen? - Milk in the tap?" "We've embarked in a state of frivolity.. "There's excitement in the entire neighbourhood." "There are a few moments of joy and happiness.. .. what else is there in laughter." "We've embarked in a state of frivolity.. "There's excitement in the entire neighbourhood." "There are a few moments of joy and happiness.. .. what else is there in laughter." "We're being carried away in a state of merriment." "We've united under the influence of Indian hemp." "We'll make a fuss of everything. We'll dance and make others dance." "Nobody will be able to stop us, if we laugh, we'll continue to do so." "We'll make a fuss of everything. We'll dance and make others dance." "Nobody will be able to stop us, if we laugh, we'll continue to do so." "There won't be any dearth of excitement today." "We've united under the influence of Indian hemp." "We've moved forward, leaving grief behind." Stop! Hey, stop gesticulating and honk. Hey, you! Hey, lass! I am no lass; I am Gauri. My name is Gauri. Like the moonlight. Hey, move out of the way! Why? Because you are sitting on the road. We aren't sitting on the road. The road is beneath us! This girl appears crazy to me. What did you say? You called me crazy, huh? Say it once more, man with whiskers! Whiskers? - Yes. What is it? Why are you staring so wide-eyed, old man? He is not an old man. He is Rajaji. `Dadaji' (grandfather)?! `Dadaji' - `Dadaji' Friends, greet grandpa! Good-day, grandpa! Damn, you've made my life, a hell! Sometimes, you break pots; at other times, you let the goats loose! Come home! - Leave me, aunt. Wow! What a piece! You behave like a child! You call such an obese piece `What a piece'! She looks like a buffalo! Buffalo? - Of course! She has such a thick waist! Fool! I'm not talking about the fat lady but the lovely girl. Hey, why are you laughing? Have you had something? You have grown so big, yet you play with children! When will some sense enter your head? - Enter? Why, it never left! Oh God! Your parents died, but didn't leave behind anything. They only left you as a burden on me! Your brother is enjoying himself in Dubai, and has thrust you upon me! Hey, speak ill about me.. ..if you must but don't say a word against brother! He sends money from Dubai every month, so this household survives.. ..or else, we would have died of starvation! All right! Now get dressed quickly. We have to attend a wedding. Welcome, Rajasahib! I thought, you'd forget an unimportant man like me. You came to my area as a mere inspector. And retired as a Deputy Inspector General of Police. How can I forget an influential man like you? I.. Hey, times have changed but not your habits. Greetings! - Greetings! Heartiest congratulations on your daughter's wedding! Thank you very much for gracing my daughter's wedding. Your daughter has got married. Now, find a boy for my niece too. Your girl is precious. She should have no problem getting married. Congratulations! Rajasahib has given his word. This implies that he has taken the responsibility of her marriage. Yes! He is the king of Vandegadh. Thank you very much! Gauri, touch his feet. He's taken the responsibility of your marriage. Touch his feet, dear. - Touch them! The girl made a face and walked off. It will work to your advantage! Gauri. Gauri is calling me! What's happening? - Happening? You'd have been dead! Fortunately, I held you on to you tight. Get up. Hold my hand. Ouch! My waist hurts! Hey, your pulse is racing! This is all due to Gauri. Thinking about Gauri has not only set my pulse racing.. .. but has also filled me with tremendous vigour! Really? That girl has cast a spell on me. I see Gauri wherever I look. See Gauri wherever you want, but not near the window. Or you will become lame and maimed! Marry? You are being forceful! Marry the one whom I haven't even seen or known? Friends, can I get married without seeing the boy? Certainly not! - Then? Quiet, brats! Scoot! We are your aunt and uncle. We are like your parents. Whatever we think, is for your good only. He is a very influential man. He is a very rich man. You will roll in luxury. - You will live like a queen! Damn! Irrespective of how I live.. ..I will not get married unless I see the boy's face! You've put me in a fix! Rajasahib's face is not worth seeing! Bring the horse if it's ready. Hey, why are you staring? You.. aren't you mute? The ones who think I'm mute, are blind and stupid! Hey, since when did you start speaking? Since 15-20 years. Implying, since so many years, you.. I was learning about your inner secrets, pretending to be mute. You thought I wouldn't reveal to anybody, as I was mute. But now, I will go to Rajasahib and tell him everything you would say. Please don't! I implore you! Forgive me. Or I'll lose my life too, along with my job. Whatever the case may be, I'll have to tell him. No! Forgive me just once! Hey, chicken-hearted man, the caretaker of the stables! Shankar was only moving his lips, but I was lending him my voice! What! - You unnecessarily got scared. This is how I was speaking. - He was only moving his lips. Childhood practice has borne fruits in youth, understand? Implying, both of you had us fooled? In this world, everybody indulges in deceit. Everybody is fooling someone or the other! Just the way you got fooled. Hey, where are you barging? Do you think I'm a horse? I'll thrash you! Yes? There's good news! The aunt has accepted the marriage proposal! What! - Yes! The uncle too has agreed! What about Gauri? - She has refused. Refused? But why? What do I lack? The mirror never lies. Take a look. I have the remedy for every grief. Hey, why are you feeling dejected? Take this. But how will eating this herbal concoction help? You've to apply this, not eat it. - What? On your hair. Darkening your hair will make some difference, right? I can dye my hair black but what about my wrinkled face? How can I change that? Yes! I will send her a photograph. What's all this? - We've agreed for the marriage. Without asking me? - Wealth has rained in this poor home. He is a gem of a boy! - Yes, dear! Aunt, I reiterate what I had said earlier. I will not blindly get married without seeing the boy's face. See his photograph. - If you disapprove, we'll return it. Right now! - Then, show it to me. Show it. - Yes. Look. Hey, take a look at brother-in-law's photograph! - Hey, listen.. Hey, take a look at brother-in-law's photograph! He looks like a film hero! He looks gorgeous! - He looks good, doesn't he? She didn't even see the photograph? - Gauri! Gauri. Gauri, where is the photograph? He looks like a film hero! He looks gorgeous! - He looks very good, doesn't he? Why are you looking that way? You.. do you talk too? I can talk and see you too. Rubbish! You are a photograph, which can neither hear nor see. If you wish, then I can touch you. Really? Show me. "When I looked at you.. "I went crazy about you." "If I win you over, I might even die." "When I looked at you.. "I went crazy about you." "If I win you over, I might even die." "I've come to live with you.. "I've come to offer you my body and heart." "When I looked at you.. "I felt the urge to live" "If I could win you over.. " "I wouldn't even regret death" "It's my good fortune that I've been showered with so much love." "Today I find my veil to be shorter than required." "It's my good fortune that I've been showered with so much love." "Today I find my veil to be shorter than required." "I've come to ask your hand in marriage." "I've come to offer my life to you." "When I looked at you.. "I felt the urge to live" "If I could win you over.. " "I wouldn't even regret death" "To love or not to love.. "Who could have control over such things?" "To fall in love with someone.. ".. is a matter of luck." "To love or not to love.. "Who could have control over such things?" "To fall in love with someone.. ".. is a matter of luck." "I haven't seen the memory of first love being wiped out." "It's unerasable." "When I looked at you.. "I felt the urge to live" "If I could win you over.. I wouldn't even regret dying" Father! Raja is getting married, and you are so excited?! Hey, why are you spoiling my mood? I'm speaking the truth. - You are? Yes! - Then answer truthfully. Why am I dying my hair black? You have a black heart. So, you are dying your hair to match it! Quiet! You are wrong! I'm dying my hair black, contemplating about marriage. Father! It's good that you have thought about marriage. Even I'm going crazy, thinking about marriage! You are? The marriage will have to take place now! It's about time now. Assume that the marriage will take place! Really? With whom? With the one who comes to this house everyday. Who comes home everyday and cooks. Yes, the same one who attends to our chores. Father! You are fixing my marriage with Rasili, aren't you? What! Rasili is going to be my wife, and your future mother! No! She will be my wife, and your future daughter-in-law! No! She is mine! - She is mine! She is mine! - She is mine! - She is mine! Did both of you call me at the same time? Yes! - Goodness me! Tell us whom you love. Me or my fat father? Don't feel shy. This is the time to speak unabashedly! Yes. Be brazen. Tell us whom you love.. Answer. Answer. - Answer! Both of you. Stand up for the nuptial rites. Place the bride before you. What's happening? - What? Rajasahib has changed the system of marriage. Why? He is performing all the rituals himself! He has altered the whole system. - Quiet! He's Rajasahib. What he's doing, is right! Right, indeed! Chant the incantations! It's the last round. I'll take care of her. But.. Chant the incantations. The nuptial rites are over. Now bless them. You? How.. how did I come here? I am your husband. I have married you as per the customs. No! That was no marriage! I consider this marriage null and void! You have deceived me! Hey, sweetheart, call it deception or cheating. I have won the game. Today, I shall fulfil every single desire of mine. I have married you. If you come close, I'll scream. Every bride screams on her wedding night. You also scream. You can never get me! Help! Will you kill me? I'll kill myself. You will never ever be able to get me! I'll never accept you as my husband. I'll die but won't accept you! Your life is my property now. Your life and death are in my hands! Everything is in my hands! If I wish, I can rape you right away. But I won't! Because I want to be your husband in every sense of the word. No! - This is why I have married you. But now, I will become stubborn. If I devour you, it will be of your own volition! I shall make that day happen, Gauri! I shall wait! No! No. Are you adding insult to injury by laughing at me? I am watching, thinking and am surprised. You did bring a lovelier flower than me. But its fragrance.. But its fragrance, you could not savour! Bindiya, I've heard that a woman knows how another woman feels. Mould that girl in such a way that she'll go crazy about me. No asking questions. I'll shower money on you. To bring in that girl as a bride for the function tomorrow,.. .. is your job! "The moon-faced beauty is under a veil.. ".. still there's brightness all around." "The moon-faced beauty is under a veil.. ".. still there's brightness all around." "The beholder might lose self-control." "The beholder might lose self-control." "The moon-faced beauty is under a veil.. ".. still there's brightness all around." "The beholder might lose self-control." "The beholder might lose self-control." "Beauty has become the bride today.. "This person is such a fortunate person." "Beauty has become the bride today.. "This person is such a fortunate person." "For a glimpse of the beautiful face.. ".. not just the heart, but one is prepared to give up one's life too." "For a glimpse of the beautiful face.. ".. not just the heart, but one is prepared to give up one's life too." "The one who sees your face is indeed a fortunate person." "The beholder might lose self-control." "The beholder might lose self-control." "The moon-faced beauty is under a veil.. ".. still there's brightness all around." "The beholder might lose self-control." "The beholder might lose self-control." "With you around, there's no dearth of beautiful sights."

"The beholder might lose self-control." "The beholder might lose self-control." "The beholder might lose self-control." "The beholder might lose self-control." This bullet could have been fired at you. But brother desires otherwise. Brother loves you, and I love brother. Love held back death. I bowed before your obstinacy. I made Bindiya sit in your place at the function.. .. in order to save the honour of my house! And you tried to dishonour me by trying to escape! Now I shall show you.. .. my true colours! I've been very loving towards you. Now, watch how acrimonious I become! When you fight hunger and thirst, you will learn to obey me! Shankar, are you also thinking what I am? I think great injustice has been inflicted on the girl. I have always heard of the adage `something is fishy'. But here, everything is fishy! The oppressor and his accomplice seem very unjust. Therefore, I feel like going into the root of this matter. You're talking about my father? `Gopal Gold Zarda?'.. Who's eating it?.. I am? You are? Spitting? If you eat it, you'll naturally spit it out! Vomitting? Extract? I understand! You want to extract information from my father! Have one more. Burp once more! You are making me drink.. .. like the way camels drink water before going out in the deserts! Am I a camel? Am I? Look, my darling, you called me; I obeyed you. You asked me to feed you drinks. I did the needful. You asked me to give you something to eat. I obliged. But why haven't you yet quenched your thirst? `Come, my darling, I'll quench my thirst!' One, two, three, four, five! Hey, how come there are five hands? There aren't five hands, there are only four. Count. One.. two.. three.. four. Hey, there are only four hands! How did I see five? You are drunk, my darling! Oh? Because I'm drunk? What's the matter, my darling? Who fed me cashew nuts? There is a fifth hand. There is! There aren't 5 hands. Look, there are two of yours and two of mine. Hey, there's the fifth hand. Somebody has caught you! That's your hand. - Mine? You are holding me. How can it be my hand? One, two, three, four.. it's gone! I've caught the fifth hand! This isn't the fifth hand, but the arm of the law! The one who fears, gets trapped in the hands of the law. Why is the arm of the law after me? You have done some wrong! Yes. The entire village is saying so. You gave Rajasahib a tablet.. ..which made him like a rusted bullet in a pistol. Neither did the trigger get pressed nor did it fire. He didn't have a wedding night. You have greatly deceived Rajasahib. I have deceived him? In fact, Rajasahib has deceived Gauri! How? Hey, speak aloud! How can I? Even the breeze can hear! If Rajasahib learns of it, he will.. Come off it! Speak into my ear. Let alone Rajasahib, even the breeze won't hear it! Speak up. Goodness me! Really? Shankar, atrocities are being inflicted on that innocent girl. The mansion will turn into ruins! Because the Lord has said.. ..where innocents shed tears, flames engulf that place! It's such a shame that my father too is responsible for this! And that poor girl.. Shankar, look at what she's doing. You? Rajasahib sprinkled oil on my fate, and you set it afire! You have made my life worse than hell! In order to get some money from your boss, you ruined my life! You played so mercilessly with a girl's life? Such deception? Why did you send me your picture when you weren't going to marry me? Why did you send this photograph? Seeing this photo.. ..I started having lovely dreams about my life with you. I began considering you as my husband. I linked my name with you. But you have left me nowhere. The photograph given to me, was a sham. The manner in which my marriage was performed, was also deceitful. And you are the root cause of all this! Why did you do this? Why did you do this? Why are you seeking vengeance from me? Now when I want to die, you won't even let me die. Tell me, what's my fault? What's my fault? Answer me! From whom are you demanding an answer? Whom are you asking? He cannot answer any of your questions. Perhaps, you aren't aware that he cannot speak. He is mute. Anyway, in a rich man's world, despite being able to speak.. ..the poor remain mute. The poor boy has lived at the mercy of Rajasahib since childhood. But he isn't responsible for the atrocities committed by Rajasahib. He has no hand in whatever has transpired. He is innocent. I.. Rajasahib, you've had too much to drink today also. Yes, I have! My friend gave a party to celebrate my marriage. And here I am, all alone! I will surely shatter my wife's arrogance! My wife will be at my feet! I will not let myself be insulted today. Today, I shall stay awake and arouse you also. Look, I have.. ..I have washed my face with cold water now. Look, I am sitting with my eyes wide open. Undress quickly. Rajasahib, I am ready. Shankar, a thirsty person comes to a well. But today, the well has come to you to quench its thirst! Quench my thirst, Shankar! Quench it! I will surely quench your thirst. You? - You are thirsty. And I am an ocean of youth. Come, drown in it! Quench your thirst. Quench it! - No! Help! No! Has anyone ever been able to escape from my clutches? Help!.. No! Help! No! Help! Help! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Help! Will you thrash me, huh? Go ahead! Will you thrash me? Will you thrash me? You touched Brijwa? This is where you belong! Beneath my shoes! You tuppence worth slave! No! Brijwa, let go of Shankar! No! - You interferred in my matters! You dare to do this! - No! Don't beat him! You swine! What's wrong, Brijwa? Why are you thrashing Shankar? Ask him, how he makes merry with Bindiya when you fall asleep! I have caught both of them red-handed! No! No! No! Don't beat him! I went to him. It's my fault. Don't beat him! Betrayer! You deceived me! You went to my slave! I will now quench your thirst in such a way.. ..that you will be on fire forever! Chandabai, she is like an artificial gem of my manor. She will get sold in your market every night! Henceforth, she will be the mistress of your brothel, not of my manor! Forgive me, Shankar. I misunderstood you. A husband is like God. To serve him, is the foremost duty of a wife. Live and die for your husband. Bestow your whole life for him. Keep him in your mind and say with me, `My husband is my Lord'. Visualise the image of only your husband. Say, `My husband is my Lord.' To obey his orders, is my duty. Say, `My husband is my Lord.' Say it. "On the garland of breath.. "On the garland of breath..

You're back? You didn't even inform us. Bless you. We went crazy thinking about you. We are seeing you after so long. What have you got for us from abroad? Where is Gauri? - She's gone. Gone? Where has she gone? Daughters have to leave home someday. Didn't you receive the wedding invitation? What! Wedding? You got my sister married without even asking me? Where? With whom? I can't express the lavish lifestyle which she's leading.. ..in a huge manor. Gauri is indeed very fortunate. He is actually a king, and not a king in name alone. King? Your brother's telegram is here. He is coming to meet you. If you get carried away by emotions, and divulge my family matters.. ..then, before your own eyes, your brother will be.. Where is Rajasahib? - I am here, brother-in-law. You? - Yes. I am your sister, Gauri's life partner. Yes. He is your brother-in-law. Brother! Brother! - Why are you crying? Why didn't you come for my wedding? I wish you had bid adieu to me. I learnt about your marriage only after I came back. Had you come suddenly this way for my marriage.. ..then I would have no grudge against life. You are unhappy. No, brother. I am happy. Very happy. I doubt any married woman must have acquired.. ..as much happiness as I have. I never dreamt I would be so happy. Look, brother. Look. Look at this manor, these luxuries, the respect.. I was in a great dilemma before coming here. But seeing you happy here, I've been relieved of all worries. Now, I will return happy. Rajasahib, I shall be indebted to you for life. You've done the poor a great favour by bestowing riches on them. Goodbye. I'll take your leave. Have something to eat. Rest awhile. You've just come. Thanks, but it is against our custom to even have water.. ..let alone eat, from a younger sister's house. Yes, brother is right. Very well. How can I break your custom? Go. Be happy. Hey, stop the cart. What's wrong? What are you saying? I can't understand. "Your sister's marriage is a deceit. Take her away from here." No! I have gone mad seeing your beauty! The demon within me has awakened today! I shall not let go of you today! Your life was set on fire, and you silently kept treading on it? Go away from here! You don't know how dangerous they are! You committed atrocities on my dainty sister! You have deceived my sister under the pretext of marriage! My sister will not stay in this hell for a moment more! Let's go. Brother! Brother! Will you take my wife out? This manor is such a cage.. ..where death awaits with its jaws open, at every door! You have come to the jaws of death! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Spare my brother! No! Brother! Brother! Shankar, I could not take my sister away from here. You.. take my sister away from here. I.. bestow Gauri's responsibility.. on you. Brother! You dare to be so audacious! Guards, catch them! Don't let them escape! No, Brijwa! I want him alive! Go! Brother, the enemy invited his own death! No. You don't know Shankar! Until I see his dead body, I will not be convinced that he is no more. I want both of them.. dead or alive! Did you trace Shankar? - We searched the entire river. But we couldn't find them. - You must not have tried. Look, I'll try! Did you see that? I tried, I killed them. Now, I will find Gauri and Shankar. Rajasahib, I'll get you many more girls like Gauri. But forget her. No! He has eloped with my wife! It has caused a crack in my heart! I will fill it with their dead bodies! I will search every nook and corner of the jungle! I will not sleep peacefully until I find them! Did you hear about Shankar's betrayal? That is why I have brought these commandos. They will track Shankar in the jungle.. ..in the same manner as hungry wolves hunt their prey. These dogs were faithful to Shankar. They would have betrayed us and warned him. Guards, go with Brijwa and find both of them in the jungle. I will search for them from top along with the DIG. Pilot, turn back the helicopter. Hey, Brijwa, where are you taking me deep into the dense jungle? Am I a cheetah? A fox? A bear? A monkey?.. what am I? If we encounter a wild bull, we will be in great danger! Did you find a bull? Look, here are the footprints. Here is an earring. Brother? - Yes? You guessed right. - What? Both of them are alive. - Really? We have found an earring and their footprints. In which direction have they headed? No! Yes? - They are hiding.. .. in the hills near the canal. Surround them. Yes.. return to the other side of the canal. Did you find them? - No. It's getting dark too. Noon has turned to dusk. Where the hell have they got lost, bloody fool? Why did a long night have to hamper our search? Eat soon. The food is getting over. I will not eat! Please eat a little. No! Amazing! Every man lives and dies for food. But Rajasahib resents the same food! Food is cooked here today. Who knows whether it will be, tomorrow? Today, we eat food. Tomorrow, a beast may eat us! Go and fetch me water immediately. No problem. I'll go and fetch it myself. Hey, walk together. This is a dense jungle. If a man behind disappears.. ..then the person in front won't even realise where he vanished! Hey, where have they disappeared? They are suspended! Hey, why are you performing a circus? Come down!.. come.. They are not coming down! Brijwa! These.. these two are also gone! That makes it three! Shankar is proving to be too much for us! He is somewhere here.. Find him! Hey, Brijwa! Forget about Shankar! It exploded, didn't it? .. the petrol tank. What happened? - A cemetery has been set up! Everybody is getting killed. That mute man will certainly mutilate or maim us! That swine is giving me a dose of my own medicine?! Giving? He is tearing us apart! Your truth is very bitter, but it is a fact. Yes. - It will be wise if we leave. Implying, we should retreat, fearing a mere slave?! When a tiger becomes a man eater, even a hunter retreats. What nonsense! - Hey.. ..if we don't heed his nonsense, then we will become history! After we die, the villagers will narrate tales.. ..of Shankar's valour to our children! In which, he will be the noble man.. ..and we'll be condemned as being evil! Sinister man.. I mean, Rajasahib.. ..at least you are sensible, aren't you? Yes. We will return. "Loneliness.. loneliness.. " "Loneliness brought us together." "Loneliness.. loneliness.. " "Loneliness brought us together." "Two hearts've been overwhelmed with love. What a delightful feeling."

"Loneliness.. loneliness.. " "Loneliness brought us together." "Two hearts've been overwhelmed with love. What a delightful feeling." No! No! No! No! No! Don't beat my Shankar! Don't!! What did you say? Your Shankar? Then who am I?.. You witch! Tol Mol, has anyone ever been able to hold back a storm of love? Never! Watch, like Shankar, I will also elope with Rasili. Go ahead! When Raja and his guards could not stop them, how can father harm me? Look, there comes my father. Watch how father is sulking! Come, father. Your face has lost colour. What is the matter? You appear very worried.. hey, speak up! Son, you spoke the truth the other day. When a young maiden is coerced into marrying an old man.. ..its outcome is disastrous, as youth is rebellious. Yes! Shankar rebelled and eloped with Gauri! I wish they had eloped.. and not come into the clutches of Raja. What are you saying! Yes, both of them were caught .. both of them were killed! Killed? - I just heard.. .. at the manor that Raja killed both of them. No! Wow! What a devastating beauty you have brought! She is not a devastating beauty, Chandabai! She is a girl whom I had deeply adored in my life. But a wretch made her unchaste, and I don't like blemished things! Who was that wretch who betrayed you, sir? He was a bloody fool! He was my slave Shankar. I sliced his neck off and killed him! But why did you spare her, sir? I could have killed this witch also if I wanted to. But death would bring her salvation. And I want her to die every moment.. with every breath she takes! That she plead for death, but not be granted death! I want every scoundrel, drunkard, and lecherous man of this area.. ..to devour her youth and tear her apart into pieces! Father! Come soon! No, my dear. Don't try to get up. Your wounds are still raw. If you get up, then the stitches of your throat will tear. Keep lying this way. Son, the bones of your limbs are broken. When I brought you here.. ..you were barely breathing. You are mute, aren't you? Many of the nerves in your throat were cut. But while stitching your throat, I saw a nerve that was crushed. Due to which you had lost your ability to speak. I have opened it. You may be able to speak now. As you were not born mute. An accident must have surely taken place with you. What had happened? Father! Father, I have brought lunch. Hariya! Hey, Hariya! Your son, Shankar, is here to call you. Coming!.. Sir! - Yes? Look what I have found. There is something glittering on the coal. What's glittering? Diamonds! - What! Diamonds! Fantastic! Diamonds in a coal mine?! I have struck it rich! Look, I found these diamonds in the coal mine! - Diamonds! When my boss returns from the city after some days.. ..I will show him these diamonds as well as that place. He will reward us handsomely! Our days of poverty will be gone! We will educate our Shankar and make him a distinguished man! Mother! Father! I'll tell everybody here that you have killed my parents! You are murderers! Leave me! What happened then? Who is that amoral, vile, monstrous man.. ..who killed Hariya and his wife? Who has committed this murder? I am the supervisor, the caretaker of these labourers. Who put burning charcoal down this innocent boy's throat.. ..and made him mute forever?! He will never be able to speak all his life! But he hasn't become blind. He will identify the criminal. I won't spare him! Shankar, identify him from among them. Who has killed your parents? Go and identify him. Are they the ones who killed your parents? Inspector, arrest them! Scoot! Did you kill the murderers? - Yes, I did. They were very dangerous and wanted criminals. They fired at us and died in an encounter. You did a good thing, inspector. Shankar, the law has sought vengeance for your parents' death. I shall raise you from today. From today, I will be your guardian angel. Wow, fantastic! Hey, Chandabai, you've hidden the most precious gem inside! Anybody who comes here, belongs to you! Listen, we are ready to pay any price you demand. Hey, I could stake everything to touch her! Don't any of you dare move ahead or try to touch her! What did you say! - Yes! When I came here, there was nobody to save me. But I shall save her! She is someone's true love, someone's possession. And I am greatly indebted to the one whom she belongs. Anyone who tries to touch her, will have to go over my dead body! Let's go! You don't realise that you have fallen in the midst of monsters. Raja has made our lives miserable. And he has killed your Shankar. No! No!! He beckoned me a while ago. I heard his voice, Bindiya. He is alive! He is! Gauri, the mute do not speak. I know that truth is bitter. But one has to accept reality in order to live. No, I won't accept it. Never! My Shankar cannot die. God is not so cruel! He is alive! He is!! He is alive! "Bodies can be separated." "Hearts cannot be separated." "How can they separate?" "Humans are not God." "What is a mountain in the eyes of love?" "Even the sky bows down..

" ".. is looked upon by the world as the holy Ganges water." "Bodies can be separated." "Hearts cannot be separated." "How can they separate?" "Humans are not God." So, they are the diamond partners.. .. who handle our diamond business abroad? Hey, they became partners later. "United today, are friends so old" "Everybody, come and eat `Gopal Zarda Gold'" Rajasahib, let us have a look at the diamonds now. I will show it to you right away. Look. Only these many diamonds? I will remove the diamonds slowly or the law will set its eye on it! Just like the way you had removed it the last time? In exactly the same way I had performed when Hariya died! Rajasahib, you are incredible! After Hariya got killed, you made two live men like us dead.. ..with the DIG's help and sent us abroad. While you started a diamond business! Both of you are absolutely safe in the eyes of the law. Meaning? - It means.. The dead are never arrested, and both of you are 100% dead! Rajasahib, forgive me.. You have greyed. So, have the pleasures in life too ceased to exist? The atmosphere today is too dull. I'll bring a beauty, so exciting, in front of you.. ..that she will have your hearts singing! Rajasahib, that maiden will not sing here! Why? - Because Gauri will not come here. Gauri?! - But why? Because that wretch, Bindiya, has become her protector. What!.. Did you hear that, Brijwa? From where did Bindiya muster so much of courage? Even if anyone dares to look at Gauri.. ..Bindiya pounces on him to tear him apart! Is Gauri alive? She is dead for all of us. But I have left her alive to let her die an agonising death.. ..living in this world. No! Don't inflict such atrocities on Bindiya! Don't! Don't do this! For God's sake, let go of her! I say stop!.. No! Don't do this! No! No! No! No! Hey, where are you going? - Move away! No! No! Stop protecting her, you fool! She has been devoured.. devoured and deflowered! Don't protect her youth which has already been blemished! Think about this ravishing beauty of yours! No! No! Hey, look here! She is a maiden so enchanting! Look at her to your heart's content! That won't cost you money! How did this blemish appear on an impeccable beauty? Wow! What a beauty! What tresses! No! What did I hear? You spoke, huh? Hey, mute man! You have regained your life and your voice. But.. what's the use? You deceived death and are confronting it again. How would you know about the wish of death, Brijwa? Are you threatening the messenger of death? I'm not threatening you but am showing you the dark shadow of death. Which is already hovering over you! Take a look. Let alone a couple of steps, retreat even a hundred steps behind.. But today, you won't be able to escape death or its shadow! Is this shadow, my death? Is it going to result in my death? This shadow is my death? This shadow will result in my death? This shadow is my death? This shadow will result in my death? I shall destroy it! You couldn't destroy me. Then how can you destroy my shadow? Will you come as my death? Come! Help! Leave me! Hand this girl over to me. I have bought her. But I have sold your life in the valley of death! What! Who are you? Try to remember. For the sake of some diamonds, you had killed my mother.. ..and my father Hariya Thakur. Shankar! Yes.. Shankar! I am the seed of enmity you had sowed 20 years ago. And I stand before you today as a thorny tree! Thorny tree? I will destroy that tree! No! You aren't destined to die so soon! First, tell me the name of the third man.. ..who had put burning coal in my mouth! Tell me who the third man was! Answer! The third man was Rajasahib. No, Shankar! Please don't kill me! No, Shankar! Don't! And this is how I regained my voice. Why are you looking at me this way? I feel like just listening to you today. Will you only listen? Won't you tell me something about yourself? I have found you, all my wounds have healed. I have forgotten everything. Let's go somewhere far away from here. Where only you, me and our world will exist. Should I leave the ones who separated my own people from me? Who ruined my childhood. Who tormented my love. Who's it? Hey, who's it? What am I seeing? Hey, wake up! Hey, wake up! - Go to sleep, father. Hey, a ghost wanders near the window, and you ask me to sleep? Where is it? - L..look there. W..where is the ghost? You scare your child? You scare a small child? You snore so much! Will the ghost come here to get killed?! Nonsense! Why are you stammering? I am very s..s.. It appears like Shankar's ghost to me! You escape from the window, I'll escape from the door. It's at the window! - Let's escape from the door! I'll also come! It's a ghost! It's a spirit! - Forgive us! I seek forgiveness for all my mistakes! I am no ghost. - He is speaking, father! He was mute. - This ghost speaks! Look at me. Touch me. Don't touch him! You will burn to ashes! He is Shankar! Father, he is our Shankar! You are alive, Shankar! How did this happen? Raja had killed you. I carry such a heavy burden of vengeance on my shoulders. That even death refused to take me away. Shankar, I also carry a burden of sin. I'll relieve myself of that burden by supporting you. Yes! This physician is with you now. Fantastic! For the first time today, I feel like embracing you! Who is that foe who stabbed me in the back? He pushed my brother into a furnace in broad daylight! Despite being a retired DIG here, you could not find out about him?! What do I do? Everybody pleads ignorance when questioned. You speak like he wasn't from this planet but was an alien trouble! Rajasahib,.. who is he? Hey, there is something around his neck. Remove it. It must be a message from the enemy. I am the one whom you are searching for. I am responsible for Brijwa's death. And I am also the one who has sent this dead body. But it's rather unfortunate that.. ..you cannot conduct any legal proceedings. Because, in the eyes of the law, this man has been dead 20 years ago. You must be wondering whose voice this is. This is the voice of your death! And this voice will not let you live now. This voice will keep reminding your associates and you.. ..about your impending death. I am burning with a fire of vengeance.. ..and all of you are engulfed in it. Its flames will burn all of you to ashes! After Ranbir, it will be the turn of Dilawar, then of the DIG. And then, it will be Raja! He did not mention my name! All of you will go away. What will I do alone then? Who could this enemy be? Hello. - Dilawar, your life is in danger. Danger? How? `Koyla' (burning coal) is behind you! What coal? What sets everything afire, and burns it to ashes! Damn! I don't understand anything! Ranbir is lying in front of me. - Lying? He is dead. - Dead? Who killed him? - Burning coal! Help! You? - He will kill me! He will kill me! - Who will kill you? `Koyla' (burning coal). - `Koyla' Yes, he is the same person who burnt your friend Ranbir to ashes. What! - Hurry up! Turn to the left, not the right. But Rajasahib's manor is on this side. He is coming from there. Turn to the left. Stop! Where have you brought me? This is a coal mine. When did I say that I was taking you to a diamond mine? But why have you brought me here? Someone wants to meet you alone. - Me? Who? Shankar. - Shankar? Who is Shankar? Hariya's son, in whose mouth you had forced down burning coal. Shankar. The keys? Who is hanging from the noose? He isn't hanging, son. He is swinging! He's really enjoying! You are right. He is the same Dilawar who had killed Hariya 20 years ago. And this DIG had put on a charade of shooting Dilawar.. ..thereby ending his story. Guards, find out who is talking. Fellow workers, the real culprit who had Hariya and his wife killed.. ..is Raja. That's untrue! He is lying! In order to seize the diamonds found in the coal mine.. ..this vile man, Raja, had killed two innocent people. He is talking nonsense! He is a wolf in a sheep's clothing! He is a monster who sheds the blood of the labourers! Who are you? Why don't you come to the forefront? I am the key witness to your crime. My parents were murdered on your orders. And when I wanted to testify against that atrocity.. ..you put burning charcoal in my mouth and deprived me of my voice! And when I identified those killers.. ..the DIG and you put on a charade about the death of those killers.. ..and had me and all these people believe it to be the truth! No! - For 20 years.. ..I remained mute. Like a helpless, orphaned slave.. ..like a dog, I kept serving you! I kept worshipping the devil thinking him to be God! But time has opened my eyes today. You have wronged me! Fantastic!.. The biggest criminal is him. He abducted my wife, in spite of being my slave. He is fabricating a tale in order to escape punishment. He is not fabricating a tale, Raja is! I was never his wife! His marriage to me was deceit, a sham! Speak up! - Yes! It is a fact that out of greed for money, we had shown Gauri.. ..Shankar's picture and made her give her consent for the marriage. Answer, Raja, isn't this the truth? What will he say? Now, I'll do the needful. He didn't trap Gauri alone. He is responsible for all the rapes and murders that took place here! He finally got caught today! I'm sorry, but father has switched parties. Hey, you fool, until yesterday, father used to give you pills. Now, he'll give you charcoal! Hit the bloody swine! No, Shankar! No! The place will catch fire! There are coal mines all around, it will catch fire! I have raised you. - To make me your slave! I have given you a life. To save yourself from death! Look, in our religion, one is set afire only after death. You cannot burn me alive! You started this story by putting burning coal in my mouth! And today, these burning charcoal will become your funeral pyre.. ..and end that story, Raja! No, Shankar! No! I implore you not to! Don't do this! No! "Bodies can be separated." "Hearts cannot be separated." "How can they separate?" "Humans are not God." "What is a mountain in the eyes of love?" "Even the sky bows down.. " ".. but love doesn't cease." "Love doesn't cease." "Love doesn't cease." "Love doesn't cease."
