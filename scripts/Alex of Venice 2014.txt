Me and your dad are mathematical wizards. Oh, really? Tell that to the debt collectors when... - Walt, where's my lighter? - In your pocket. Shit. Dad, come on. How many times do I have to tell you to smoke in private. Okay? It's medicinal. Smells good out here. Hey. So, I think we have a real good chance of winning this thing. I haven't seen Maureen this excited in a long time. - Good for you, that's great. - How's the parent-teacher conference? Look, academically he's fine, they just... they want him to have more friends. He has friends. He has a friend, I mean, I hate it when they say stuff like that. Dakota is fine. Yeah, of course he's 'fine,' I'm just saying... - Have you paid this? - They want us... ...to encourage him to have more friends. Yeah, I paid this. I just think it'd be good for him. Not everybody needs to have a ton of friends. I didn't. Well, next time there's a parent-teacher conference, you can have it out with them. Hey, Maureen. Yeah. Back in the day... when I was doing the show. We used to go down to Xalapa. This beautiful little fishing village. Really, Dad? Xalapa again? I love Xalapa. Isn't that where you met that sweet young thing? - Stripper. Yeah. - Dad. What? I can't say the word 'stripper'? I can't say 'stripper' in my own house? - What... would you prefer 'peeler'? - George... Don't forget you had that audition... tomorrow, so put it in your phone, okay? - What's the audition? - Play. It's a play. How do you... how do you do that again, George? Lemme see the ring? Just put it in the calendar. How many times do I have to show you this? Open up the calendar, - the calendar's right there, okay? - Cool. Hit calendar, and then... I got it. Right, and you talked to her about that? - It's Tuesday, so... - Right. Your blood pressure and your cholesterol and your multivitamin. - On the... top of the week. - Yeah. I left him a message about that. He's going to call me tomorrow. - You fill up the days with the pills. - Yeah, but how will I know? - Yeah. Okay. - I made you a list. It's easy. - Just... come on. Pay attention. - Great. No, how will I know what pill goes into what day. - I made you the list. Go put it on the fridge. - I don't need this. - Yes, you... it doesn't hurt to have it. - You got me covered. Are you kidding me? I shouldn't have to beg you to take your fucking medicine. - You're... you're not a baby! - Can I... can I call you back? Okay. Okay, great. Thanks. Just take the fucking list, okay? Sorry. Hey... why don't you and pop... go ahead and get ready for bed. Alright? Sorry, George, I'm... Sorry, I just made a list for your Dad. I can't... I can't keep going over this. Can't keep going over this. What's going on? I... I can't... I can't be your housewife anymore. What? How are you my housewife? I did the cooking and the cleaning, and I... - I go to PTA meetings. - And you paint, and you surf, and... - Not really, not anymore. - Well, you could. I... I just need some... time away. I've given up a lot for us. That's not fair, okay? That's not fair. You... You're the one who said he wanted me to go back to school, right? You're the one who said he'd stay home with Dakota. It's not my fault if you didn't paint, George, okay? So don't put that on me. I just don't feel like you... you're around anymore. You know? I want to... I don't feel like you're... you're... I want to, you know, I want... I want some... I want to do things too, you know? George, you can paint, I mean, y... You could do whatever you want. I'm not holding you back from those things. I just need time away. So what, you're just leaving? You're just going to leave? Where are you going to go? I don't know. I'll figure it out. - It's my dad's party on Saturday. - I got your stuff. It's in the fridge. - Are you going to come to the party? - I don't know. Well, who's going to grill the steaks if you don't come? Are you fucking kidding me? Did you just hear yourself? Who's going to grill the fucking steaks? Well, what are you going to say to Dakota? What are you doing up? Look at those stars. - Where does your dad keep your lunch box? - Mom, I don't use a lunch box anymore. - This coffee tastes like crap. - That's 'cause I made it. Well, George makes the best coffee. Where's he? - His mom is sick. - What's wrong with his mom? No, he has an art show. Oh, he has an art show. Of course. Of course he has an art show. Where is the art show? Santa Fe. Santa Fe. Okay. Okay. Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, your pills? Okay, so it's Wednesday. Wednesday you have veratrol. Wednesday... pink or blue. Which one? Figure it out later. - How am I going to get to school? - I'm going to drive you. We gotta go, we gotta go, come on. Hey, Dad? - You're picking up D after school, okay? - Well, I got that audition. I'll get you right after, kid. Hey, Maureen. - Vanessa told me you were running late. - Yeah, I had a family emergency. I can't be there. I have a fundraising breakfast. It's going to be five minutes, ten tops, and Josh can start for me. He knows the case. Josh is not a lawyer. I'm going to be there, I'm just... I'm going to... I am just going to be there. - I'm counting on you, Alex. - Okay. All good. Okay, so grandpa's going to pick you up. - You know I love you, right? - Yep. Okay. We're good. We are good, we are good, we are good. Obviously we were stunned to receive the petition. The city sold that land to my client fair and square. With the promise of minimal impact to the air quality - and wildlife of a nature preserve. - Mr. Williams... California's already lost 98% of its wetlands. This tadpole exists in the 2% that is left. All we're asking is that Mr. Evans cease and des... cease and desist construction on his... - Fuck it, you do it. I... - Thank you. I am so, so, sorry. I'm so sorry, Your Honor. Your Honor, when the district sold my client that land, they understood the financial rewards of the project. It'll bring millions of dollars to a city that's basically bankrupt. That means jobs. Your Honor, and again, I apologize for being late, but when the city agreed to sell Mr. Evans the land for a resort, he agreed to meet certain environmental standards, and as you can see from exhibit A, he's already in violation of those standards. I have yet to see a chain of custody report. When you destroy a species you pave the way for the destruction of the next. It's a domino effect. And all of these creatures have valuable roles in our ecosystem. They regulate our air, our water, our weather patterns... I'll hear your case on June 25th. Your Honor, that's not enough time for us to build a fair case. Just take it and say thank you. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, Your Honor. - Frank Evans. - Alex Vetter. - This is my colleagues Josh Williams. - Hey, man, nice meeting you. Thank you for bringing the problem to my attention. I'll see what I can do. - You can stop building your spa. - Nah. I'm serious. I'm sure we can find a great compromise. Okay, we've got a lot of work to do. I bought it. I bought it. I... I bought it. I bought it. I did, I did. Wait, please. Director's kind of a dick. You look familiar. Well, I was... I was on a television show for a long time. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. That must be it. You know this is Chekhov, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Well... I have some... I trained in the theater and so... that's how I started in the theater and stuff. - Great. - Yeah. Great, well... thanks for coming in today. We're only going to take a look at the first scene. And... - You know, whenever you're ready. - Okay. This is Mel. She's going to be reading with you today. - Okay. Hi, Mel. - Nice to meet you. Just a second here. I bought it. I did it. I bought it, I... I bought the Cherry Orchard. Wait, wait, ladies and gentlemen, please don't go. I... I am a little... dazed. I'm confused, I... I'm going to stop you right there. It's great, it's really, really great. Would you... would you mind taking a look at another part? - Sure. Yeah. - It's okay? Would you mind taking a look at the part of Firs? It's the servant. - The really old one? - Yeah. Okay. Sure. What's up with you? You seem off. Oh, I'm sorry, no. I'm... I'm totally fine, I... - Everything's okay? - Everything's good. I have a small... Just a blip of a thing happening at home, but it's... But you're up for this? - I need you to be up for this. - I'm... If you're not, just tell me. I'll get someone else. - No, I'm up for this. - Don't bullshit me. Alex, Dakota's school, line one. - Yes. - Can I just take... just the... okay. Hello? I am so, so sorry. I don't know what happened. My husband's out of town and I asked my dad to come and pick him up, and I can't get a hold of him. I'm... Please, don't worry. Everything's fine. Dakota's fine, that's what's important. And it gives us the opportunity to check in with each other - since we missed you at parents' night. - Right, well, I had to work, so... Did your husband mention that I talked to him about your encouraging Dakota to reach out to some of the other students? Right. Yeah, he did mention it and we're working on it. Oh, that's great. - Such a sweet boy. - Well... yeah, so I should get him home. - But thank you so much. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Don't be a stranger. Alright. - What happened? - What do you mean? You were supposed to pick up Dakota after school. You don't remember? - You don't remember that? - Oh, shit. What, you just forgot? Is that what happened? You just forgot? W... you should've put it in my phone. - I shouldn't have done anything. - I need it in the phone. I asked you to pick him up, and that's all I should've had to do, and you're smoking and you're not thinking and you're not remembering a word I say. George always puts it in the phone so I don't forget. - This is exhausting. - I'm sorry, kid. I'm so... Grandpa wouldn't have left you hanging like that. It wasn't in my phone. Party's here. - Oh, my God. - See? - Oh, my God... Lily. - I was bringing in your sister. I was trying to do something good. No, Dad, it was so good, so good. But, if you say you're going to pick up Dakota, you have to pick up Dakota. I'm so sorry, boo. Daddy told me what happened. Men are such dicks. All of them. - So... - No, Dakota, what happened to him? You're fucking gi-normous. You look like a grown man, come here. Give me a hug, oh, my God, what the fuck happened to him? - Two years happened. - You already had your first kiss I bet? Okay, he's only ten, so let's just... - Oh, fuck, I'm so... - The language. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Good to see you. Oh, it's good to see you. She looks good? I think your butt got a little bigger. How can you say that to me? You're my daughter, I can say whatever I want. - No. - Yeah. - No. - Yeah. So Dad says you're working on becoming a masseuse. Oh, no, not anymore. But I had this client. I think he thought I was like a different kind of masseuse. - Shit. Really? - Yeah. But you know what? My line is totally coming together. I have an investor all lined up and they're just waiting on me, so it's going to be so great to be here, 'cause I can focus on my designs and draw every day and... Speaking of which, did you ever wear that dress I sent you for Christmas? - Yeah. - Did you look so money? I looked so money. - Alex, this is really fucking weird. - What? That you sleep in their bedroom. It's not that weird, I just... it made the most sense. So, what's happening with Dakota? What do you mean? I mean, have you told him that his dad is a fucking asshole? I'm not going to make Dakota upset when we're just going to get back together. You know what? You keep shit from kids... He's ten. They get all fucked up. Thanks, Lily, but I can handle my own ten year-old. I know that. I wasn't saying you weren't a good mom. No, I know you weren't, I know you weren't. I am behind at work, so, I'm going to... get to bed. - Okay. - Okay. - Where are you going to sleep? - Right here. It's going to be like old times. Yeah. Hey, Lee. Yeah. Okay. Right. Well, that's... perfect. That's great. Yeah, okay. - I got the part. - You got... you got... - In the... in the play. - You got Firs? Yeah. That's the greatest p... I'm... Firs is the greatest part there is. George? You said that you were going to be here today, so if you're not coming, can you just let me know either way? Alright? Okay, thanks. - Do you need help with those? - What, you know how to do this? No, but I'll figure it out. Should you be drinking that? It's just beer. It's like water. Hey, Dad. Hope you're having a good trip. Miss you. When you get back, I have a surprise for you. Not going to tell you what it is right now. You have to see it. Alright? Call me back. Hey, Friday. Hey, buddy. Hey, this is George, leave a message. What the hell is going on, George? You're not even going to text me back? I can't believe you're doing this to us. Dakota waited for you all day, George. And everybody was out there asking me where you were. What am I supposed to say? - Just fucking call me back. - Ignition. And we have liftoff of the Voyager 1 spacecraft, on its deep space expedition. Launched in September, 1977. Voyager 1 was sent by NASA to study the outer solar system. New York is a crazy place. I used to take the subway all the time, but then last month I was waiting for the train, and I'm sitting next to this cute little old rasta man. And I thought 'oh, what a cute little old man.' then I looked down and I realized he was jerking off. - I'm back to cabs. - I'm late for work. - It's Sunday. - She always works on Sundays. Yeah, when Dad wakes up, make sure he takes his meds. The list is on the fridge, okay? And can you walk Friday? - Got it. - Okay. I love you. The waterfall. Look at the colors he has in the waterfall. Blue and green. So cool. Right? - Hey, Billy. - Hey, Al, what's going on? - Have you seen George around? - No, I haven't seen him. - Okay. Thanks. - Everything alright? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Thank you. Okay. Take care. Hey, this is George, leave a message. The science of managing wildlife in a land full of people is new. And scientists know if they're not careful, helping one species could harm another. That's the subject from our next story from Centennial Valley. Dean Schofield, NPR news. These are really good. - You don't have to say that. - I'm being serious. Okay. Who's the hottie? Come on, who is she? What? You have such a crush. Yes, you do. What's her name? - Rain. - Oh, Rain. Do you like her? You should show her these. If a guy drew me like this, forget it. Forget it. Okay, okay. Madam will have her coffee here. Where's the cream... where's the cream? Where's the... Well, in here it says, 'is the coffee ready.' I don't know if... Yeah. First you say 'is the coffee...' Madam will have her coffee here. Can I just... ask you something? When you called Lily... to come, I mean, why did you do that? You know, I thought it'd be... You know, nice to get the family together. I always like that. Is that the only reason, or... 'Cause I'm trying. I... You just got a lot going on... Alex. But, you know, it's your... it's your job. I mean... I understand. I... I understand. You've always been that way. Even in school you were ambitious. You'd get your work done a month in advance, and... you now, and be asking for more and... Is that a good thing? I don't know where you got it. I don't know if it's a good thing. Well... you'll figure it out. You always do. Hey, Al, come here, check this out. - Hey, Josh, let me get a shot of that. - You find something? - Great, thanks. - So... unfortunately our tadpoles aren't doing that well. Normally the wetlands water would be relatively clear. You can definitely see that's got a metallic color, like, rust color. It's just not right. - Josh? - Yeah? - When can you get me those numbers? - I can get them to you later tonight. Okay. As soon as you have the results, call me. I don't give a fuck what time it is. Alex? Tomorrow morning we're going to discuss the best way to present. - Great. - Everybody's on call tonight. - Okay. - This is big. Good work everyone. Yeah. Good night. - I mean... really. - The pepper is the main attraction here. - This was so good, Lily. - It's just spaghetti. - Could've used a little more sauce. - Little bit. Well, we don't have any more. Okay? What's the play about, Grandpa? It's about an... an old servant who... has been working for this family forever. And the family is broke and they have this cherry orchard, and this kind of dumb young guy... chops down the... cherry trees and puts up condos or some shit. And then they all leave the house and forget about me, and I'm left there alone and... then I guess I die. It's ambiguous. Oh, my God. That's so depressing. I don't want to see that. No, it's Chekhov. Sounds whack. - What... are you hearing this, Walt? - You know, just... What? Why are you always taking a poop on everyone's parade? - She's just being realistic. - I do not poop on anybody's anything. Fine, Dad, you know what? I bet this is going to be a huge game changer for you. Oh, now, you hear this Roger? A game changer. - They're making fun of me. - No, we're not, Dad. - Of course you are. - Ganging up on me. - We are not, Dad. - We don't gang up on you. - Mom. I think the oven's on fire. - Yeah, babe? - Fuck, the chocolate chip cookies. - Oh, shit. Okay, it's fine. Everyone just calm down, this is really... - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - I'll get this window. - Yeah, I'll do this one. Where does your dad keep the fire extinguisher? We have one in the house somewhere, don't we? - I have no idea. - Well, I thought... - Be cool. - What's the status on the cookies? - Shit! - Are you okay, Mom? - You okay, Alex? - I'm fine, I'm fine, no. Sweetie, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm good. Are we going to have cookies or not? - What a question, Dad. - If you didn't notice, the house is burning down. Yeah. The house is not fucking burning down. I'm just... I'd like a cookie. Okay, what do we ask it next? Ask this board something you wouldn't know. Alright. Am I ever going to have sex again? Okay, first of all, what? I can tell you right now the answer is yes. Well, I mean, I've... I've only ever had sex with George, so... What? - Are you serious? - I got pregnant when I was 19, Lily. That's like the saddest thing I've ever heard. Okay, you know what? You're going to have sex tonight. - With who? - We're going to find somebody. I'm not going to have sex with a stranger. If that's what you're talking about. - Why not? - Because there are diseases. There's also condoms. Okay, okay, so there's... there's a guy at work, but it's not... Okay, great. Let's text him. - What do I say? I don't want to text him. - Just ask him if he wants to get a drink. A drink. What... like, a drink where? Like... What? Who cares just be like, 'Hey... what up? Do you want to get a drink?'. Hey... Josh... how are you? No. What? 'How are you?'. No. - It's... I need, like an introduction. - No. We're not writing, like a letter from camp. Just say, like... 'Hey, I'm really into anal...' Do you want to get a drink? Just be, like 'hey, what's up? You look like you have like a mushroom dick, and I want to sit...' Just be like 'hey, what's up? I've only had sex with one person. My pussy's tight.' Just fucking write it. Give it to me. Give it to me. Don't write it. No, you're going to write something horrible. - No. Oh, give it to me. - Stop. No, no, no, no, no, no. - We're not writing a letter. - Lily, give it back. I'm ser... Lily. - Stop it. - Lily. I'm serious. I'm serious. I will... - I... love... double penetration... - Give it back, give it back, give it back. - ...and sent. - Lily, please don't. Please don't. Done. Oh, my God, this is so exciting. I know exactly what you should wear. What did you say? Please, Lily... I... Oh, he already texted back. He said sure. Does this mean I just arranged to have sex with him? No. You know what? I have this dress. It's like a magical dress. I'm going to go get it. You should wear it tonight. Okay, this dress, no underwear... you're set. Don't... it's... easy access. Oh, great. That's what I'm looking for. Maybe that's what you need? Come on, go try this on. No. I can't. Yeah, I'm just not ready. Madam will take her coffee now. Madam will take... Where's the cream? Where's the... I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't do this. I can't do this play. - What do you mean you can't do it? - I can't do this fucking play. Of course you can. It's not sticking. The... I can't... I don't see the... the words. They're not staying in my head. I... - You're doing the fucking play. - No. Yes, you are. You going to do the play. There's no question about it. And you're going to be brilliant. Here's some good news. The scientist from the Tahoe case saw the PH numbers - and says he'll fly himself in to testify. - Oh, that's good news. - Right? - Yeah. Wait, however, he also says the numbers aren't quite high enough - and they're going to claim quick uptaking... - Okay, guys, I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. He says that they're going to claim 'uptaking pollution is due to nearby refineries and weather patterns.' That's bullshit. Well, the dead tadpoles will help. I mean, if... if more die, that'll... that'll help. I hate that I have to hope for the death of tadpoles in order to prevent... the death of tadpoles. What did... what did you want last night when you... when you texted me? I... I was just thinking about the case and... Yeah. Just something... something to do with that. Okay. Hey, you know? Do you want to just take this back to my place and... I don't know, work with a bottle of wine or something? Or... Yeah, yeah. We could do that. - Yeah, like now? - Yeah. I mean, yeah, sure. Sure. When you think of elephants... you don't... I don't know. You think of innocence and... I don't know. Elephants. Alright? - Like, they remember stuff I guess? - Yeah. But this thing, it was like, they're a lot like... they're a lot like us. Like they... they crave... - contact, like physical contact... - Right. ...with each other. They like, roll around... on each other. Elephants. - These big, thick-skinned... - Oh, yeah. ...creatures are just... And their... their trunks... They'll like, you know, intertwine their trunks and, like... You know, it's like... It was... what I... it was oddly sexual. - Like on their part. Yeah. - Really? But it was like, I was... I was moved to tears. That's amazing. I mean, that sounds like an... that sounds like an incredible thing to see. Yeah. And I kept saying they're wiggling. They're like... they would just wiggle like worms on each other. Hi. Hey, Dad. Hey. My lines... Sorry, what, Dad? My lines. I can't find my lines. Okay. - Excuse me. - Well, you'll find them. Dad... - This is... this is Josh. - Hi. - This is my dad. - Hi. - It's a play. - Oh, okay. Did you look in your room? It might be... That stupid thing... Beth? What? What was that? Did he really just think I was Mom? He's got to stop smoking so much weed. I'm so sorry. I'm... That's never happened before. I... I'm so sorry. Hi, I'm Lily. I'm... I'm Alex's sister. Hi, Lily, I'm Josh. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Okay. I'm going to go out. You guys have fun saving the planet. Anyway, I was... I was about to ask you something before all that. What was I going to ask you? God. I've... completely lost it. Oh, I mean, with a dress like that, how... how can you... keep focus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. That was... that was some dress. Hey, Tom. Get this lady a drink. What are you having? - I don't need... I don't need anything. - No, it's on me. - A vodka soda. - You got it. Okay. Frank Evans. Yeah, yeah. I remember. Enjoy. - I'm going to come around. - Okay. Nice dress. It's my sister's. Very attractive. Thanks. - So you live around here? - Yep. Yep, my whole life. Grew up here. Yeah, me too. It's funny, I've never run into you here. Oh, I don't go out. Ever, at night... I... - I was married, so. - Was? Yeah, the jury's still out, I think. Okay. Well, it was... it was good to see you. This is what I'm talking about. I'm talking about what the world is going to look like in ten years, and you apparently don't give a shit. - I don't have to defend myself to you. - No, why would you? Why would you? Alex... this is the way the world works, - if I don't build there, someone else will. - God, I hate that argument. I hate it. Okay, you hate this then. Do you know how many jobs I'm providing for kids who have not had the luxury of going to law school? You... you know what the community's like around that marsh. Half of the families there are on food stamps. Families are going to eat because of my spa, and you want to know how that looks in the next 10 years? I'm talking about a good school, a great public park... and a kid like me can dream of going to law school. - That's my vision. - Okay. No, I get it, I get that. I'm just saying... For me, I'm... I'm worried about what it's going to look like in ten years. What it's going to look like a hundred years from now. That's what I'm thinking about, and maybe that makes me a total weirdo. Yeah, you are a weirdo. I mean, in a good way though. Yeah. You want to know... how much of a total weirdo I am? Sure. I've only had sex with one person... my whole life. That's a... big 180. Yeah. I... I met George at 18, got pregnant 19, and so now I'm totally fucked. You know? That's kind of exciting actually. It's like you're starting out for the second time. I mean, most people they've done that already. It's in the past. So you want to have sex with me? One morning I woke up at the Chelsea Hotel. I don't remember how I got there. But that's another story. What I do remember is they had a great egg scramble, and that's what we're making today, the Chelsea Hotel special. Do you like tomatoes? - Morning. - Morning. I worked all night and fell asleep at the office. In my dress? Dad just texted me. - So what did he say? - He's still in Santa Fe. You want to skip school and hit the beach? I just fucking love/hate this city. I'm such a Cali girl at heart, really. Why'd you leave? I don't know. I needed a change. - Is that what happens? - What? Grown-ups get... bored and... need to change. Well, first of all, I am not a grown-up, and second of all. Are you talking about your dad? Okay, I'm just going tell you this, he did not get bored of you. I'm serious. How could anyone get bored of you? He's got his own shit going on. It's his problem. Other than that, we're still waiting to hear from the environmental impact report. Vanessa, where are the interns with the community? - Nowhere. No one will sign the petition. - What? Alex, what's going on? That community's living below the poverty line. They're not going to get on board. They want jobs. They don't know what they want. It's our job to educate them. - You're totally right. - Maureen, EPA line two. - What's up with your sister? - What do you mean? - Like, what's her deal? What's she about? - I don't know. She has a clothing line. - A fantasy clothing line and a boyfriend. - May I ask who's calling? Sure. - Why? - Please hold. No reason. You should bring her by my birthday party. Alex, line one. Hello? Hi. No, no, no. You don't have to do that, you don't have to do that. I will... I will be right out. Okay. - Hi. - Hello. I'm actually really glad that you called because I wanted to tell you that... I was really drunk last night. And I'm really embarrassed, so... - Yeah, nobody needs to know about that. - You want to have lunch? Oh, man. This is crazy. - So this is what you do? - So this is what? - This is what you do. - This is what I... what? No. This is like... is this like your 'game?'. Like you, you know exactly like, you know, you pick up the women at the bars and this is like you show them your beautiful house and all your beautiful things and... - Trap. - Trap. Trap, gotcha. No. I don't do that, I... I mean, I've gone to the bar... But I have... - I've met women at the bar. - You have... I mean, I'm friendly. No? Well, I hope this, you know... compares. I mean, I don't know what I'm saying. I'm... I hope that this has been good in comparison to... the other women that you may have or may not have brought home from the bar. I'm glad you're concerned. I'm glad you are concerned with the outlook. So you're basically trying to ask me did you rock my world? Shoot, you crazy girl. - Voila. - Thank you. Enjoy it? Yeah, it's amazing. So... what happened? What? Your husband. He wasn't happy. Apparently. So... so he... so he got out. And now he's figuring out what he wants to do with his life. I don't know, I guess he felt like... I wasn't seeing him or... And I don't know, maybe he's... he's right. Yeah, that can be hard. And... getting married when you're 20, sometimes, you change and you don't change together. I didn't have it as figured out as I thought I did. Am I crazy person talking about my... I don't know. I kind of feel like this is something you're not supposed to do. No. Is this some ploy to get me to fuck up the case? You know what? It should be. Can we take it right before the dance? It would be perfect. Oh, Petya. My darling, I'm so sorry. You sweet boy. Forgive me. Please come dance. Come, come dance with me. Roger, that's your entrance. - Yes. - That's always been your entrance. - I'm sorry. - You've gotta tattoo that into your brain. - That will always be your entrance. - Yeah, I got it now, sorry. - Do you want to go back or... - No, keep going. What's the matter, pops. I... I don't feel too well. I'm... In the old days, we had a dance, we had... We had... Roger. Roger, do you need a minute? 'Cause I can't. - No, I'm... I'm sorry. - Okay. - I just lost my place here. - That's okay. You have to be off book. I'm sorry, I don't... It's just... at this point at this far along, it's not fair to the other actors and I don't know how to rehearse the play if you're not good at it. - Okay. - Okay? Okay, thanks so much. - Take five you guys, and then we'll... - Sorry, guys. No, no, no, no, no, no. You... - Poppin' bottles. - Poppin'... - Poppin' bottles. - Poppin' bottles. - We have some rain rain. - Rain rain. - Champagne. - Champagne. Where your hundred dollar bills at? Dad? Dad? I got confused. - Just... got confused. - Just... let me help you up. Go away. Just go away. Dad, this is your shirt, it's... Get the fuck out! Get out! Go. 'Cause I really need a new bike too. 'Cause mine's like, falling apart, like... I think the tires popped. I tried pumping it back up but... they just got flat right away again, so... - It's just not working. - Okay. And the chain keeps coming off. Well, I guess we'll have to figure that out. Maybe you'll give me that for my birthday. We'll see. Can we come in, Dad? You didn't eat anything. Do you want us to take you to the doctor? As you can see from our report and from the witness testimony today, construction has only been underway two months, and already the effects on the life of the pond have been devastating, and we're asking the court to halt construction until we can come up with a solution, either Mr. Evans moves construction ten miles west... or he alters his construction plans. What it all comes down to, Your Honor, is our legacy. What do we want to leave behind, a hotel? A spa? We can't prevent our ends, but we can prevent the ends of this earth. We can make it so... our great, great grandchildren who we will never meet will... swim in the same ocean we did. Will hike the same mountain. Enjoy the same view. I mean, I find that really comforting, that... no matter how out of control or tenuous most of life is there are some things that are forever. If we fight for them. Thank you, Your Honor. The district sold the land to Mr. Evans with the understanding that he would abide by environmental standards. And in studying the information put before me and the agreement made with the district... it cannot clearly be proven that the changes to the marsh is the fault of Mr. Evans' construction. Loopholes in a prior contract with the district have allowed for the current margin. This case is dismissed without prejudice. Alex. - Alex, come on. - Congratulations, Frank. Hey, listen. Hey, I just want to talk to you for a second. Alex. Alex! Hi. - Hey. How are you doing? - I'm good, I'm fine. - You alright? - Yeah, I'm totally fine. I'll see you. Fucking hate parties. Alright, this is going to turn up. I'm down. You know what? I don't think I'm going to stay very long. Just so you know. Come on. We just need to get you a drink. Let's get you some Tequila, okay? - Okay, I'll have one drink. - Right, a lot of young dick here. Yep. Lot of young dick. Look, tonight, I just want you to forget about the case. Dakota's at a friend's house. Let's just try and have a good time. - Fuck. - Who are you texting? - Hey, Alex. - Birthday boy. Yeah, well, it's not my birthday. My birthday's on Monday. - That's okay. - We're just celebrating tonight. - That's alright. - You guys look fucking great. - Maybe, yeah. Great feet, great feet. - He's into feet. - I just got my toes done. - We're not going to talk about it, right? - Not going to talk about it. - We're going to have fun. Going to have fun. I lived in a redwood tree for three months, and I didn't have anything. There were days where I didn't have food. No. There were days I didn't have water. I had to poop in a bucket. I had to piss off the tree. But I always found time to have sex. Do you guys want to do some ecstasy? No, no. No, we're good. Okay. I mean, I could... - do it. - Yes. - Yeah? - Yes. - Really? - What? No? Why not? - You'd peak too hard. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - 'Cause you're pretty intense. Oh, fuck you. I want the ecstasy, please. - Just... - Give it to her. I'm surprised you haven't been prescribed this. Thank you. - I am so excited for this. - This is going to be good for you. - Yes. - Shit. I gotta... one second. You sure you don't want any ecstasy? I think Alex is going to get really mad if I take X. I used to have like a bit of a problem with like pills and... stuff. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - George? - Hey. - Hi. - How you doing? I'm good, yeah. Are you? What, he missed a week of school? But... I only had like two visitors. I'd only have sex with one of them. I gotta call you back. - What are you looking at? - Nothin'. Oh, hey, Lily... - I meant to ask you, how was this week? - What do you mean? With Dakota, and taking him to school and everything. Everything was okay, right? What do you mean? It was fine. So he didn't... miss a week of school this week? You're so full of shit. - What are you talking about? - Get out. - I don't want to see your face. Get out. - Alex... listen... He needed someone to talk to, okay? He didn't need to go to school. He wanted to talk. - Oh, really? You couldn't have told me that? - Yeah, he did. No, I couldn't. When? When is anyone supposed to fucking tell you anything? This isn't how the world works, Lily. You can't let my kid miss a week of school. Are you being serious right now? You're... you're mad that Dakota missed a week of school? Lily, I am his mother. You do not have the right to take my son out of school. You do not have the right to do anything with him without going through me first. Do you understand that? How does that not get into your brain? Why are you... you think you're so fucking perfect? You're not, Alex. Look at your life. It's a mess. Hi. I think I might need a ride. Yeah, I don't think I should drive right now. - Hey. - Hi. You okay? I don't know if I can walk. Here, have this. That's supposed to be... - that's supposed to help? - It'll help. How am I going to do it without you? You're already doing it. Dakota missed a week of school. And I'm coming down from ecstasy. You're great. And you've always been great. Feel better? Thank you for getting me water and tangerines. - Do you want something else? - No. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I just... - Do you want me to go? - No. No, please. How's your dad? I don't know. I don't know. I went to the doctor and... I don't know. He might have Alzheimer's, just... It's time to go. We had a dance and we had generals... and admirals. And... No. Generals and barons and admirals. - Yeah. - And nowadays we... we have the... Nowadays we have... - We have to send out. - Yeah. Nowadays we have to send out for the postman? - Postmaster. - Oh, postmaster. And... stationmaster. - Good morning. - Shit. You're back? Where's Dakota? He's in the back. Dad. Hey. Looking good. Mom's the worst cook. Well, she's... yeah, she's pretty bad. Used to be good. When we were younger... I think she's just... I think she's just out of practice. Was that why? What? 'Cause she's a bad cook? No, no. No? Well, I don't know, you know, just... when you're young, you... I mean, I... You know, when you get older people change, and... it's good changes, good, but you... sometimes... sometimes change is... painful, and... you know, but... but it's necessary. Right? You know, it's... it's not... Will you come back? I'm back. Yeah, I'm back. I'm back forever. With you. But I'm... I don't think I'm coming back... to your mom's. Goodbye, house. Goodbye, old life. No, no, no, no, no. It's hello, new life. I know. I know, I know. I know. Hello, new life. - I'm sorry, I... - No, I'm sorry. I fucked up. I should've taken Dakota to school. I don't know what I was thinking. Lily. I'm really glad you came. - Really? - Really. Thank you. George isn't coming back. I think... I think things changed... between us a long time ago, and I just didn't see it. What are you going to do? I don't know. All I know is I want to spend time with my son. Oh, my beautiful... beautiful orchard. You were my life. You were my youth. My happiness. Goodbye. - You got him. - Finally got him. Drew him. Then this is... - I love its eyes. - This is... this is the one for grandpa. Henry the... and there's grandpa. Gave him his favorite hat there. And I wanted this one of... Friday, 'cause... Wonder wouldn't come on the back porch with... - Hey. - Hey. I want you to know... that this has nothing to do with you, okay? Okay? You hear me? I love you. And your dad loves you. And that is never going to change. That is never going to change ever. Okay? Come here. Is everybody gone? Is there anyone left? Alright. Let's go. They've gone away. They forgot about me. Life has gone on... as if I never lived. I'll lie back. You have no strength left in you. Nothing left at all. You... bungler. - Hey. - Oh, my God. - You were so amazing. - This Cherry Orchard's the shit. - Dad. - You killed it. - That was awesome. - You killed it. Straight to Broadway. So did you like the play? - Yeah. - Yeah? I really liked it. It's crazy. He wrote it, like, around a hundred years ago. Yeah, it's kind of cool. People have the same problems then as they do now. Yeah, it is kind of cool. Hey, can I have a lick of your chocolate? I told you the jalapeno would be disgusting after the 3rd lick. I know. I know, I should've listened. ...but I found my girl My notion of love devotion Was a corrosion of mind Then come cupid and now I'm stupid And I feel it's just fine Like exploding face I'm going to tell the world Been a million years full of fears But I found my girl It's a spun tongue It's a holy shit It's a loud cry from the heart It's a live death It's a big breath It's a no more we're apart Like a rainbow crash As we bow and swirl Been a million years full of tears But I found my girl Like exploding sun Let the light unfurl Been a million years full of fears But I found my girl
