I am Canadian. Exactly. With an expired visa. I am about to be deported. And why not want to leave this wonderful country of yours, Andrew forced the to marry me. Margaret, stop. Andrew has always had that ethics extraordinary work. Something that I think learned from you. And for three years, saw him working above all in the company. And I knew that threaten to destroy his career, he would do anything. Then the blackmail to come here and lie to you. All of you. And I thought it would be easy to watch. But it is not. It is not easy to destroy someone's life after discovering they are amazing. You have a beautiful family. Do not let this the panic. It was my fault. Margaret. Andrew was a business and you met, but now, the business is canceled. Sorry. Meet me on the dock and Take me to the airport. - What were you thinking? - Why lie to us? Let me think a little, explain everything later. Sorry. You were right! This book is special. I lied, because if the public, lose as the assistant, but you have a extraordinary eye. And I will buy that before I leave. Have a wonderful life. You deserve it. Margaret. Wow, that was crazy. The people speak it forever. Okay? I am ... no. I just ... Where is he? The problem is that this woman is a giant foot in my bag. First, I stand for the false marriage, stressful environment. So she leaves the ticket. He had neither the decency to speak in my face. Three years! Three years that worked with this terrorist! Never say anything cool, who writes this shit up! And no matter, it had an agreement. Sorry, I just ... She makes me crazy. Can you understand that. So, leave it go? So, now what? Claiming that it will voluntarily, is all very civilized.
