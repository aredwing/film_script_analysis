Sorry, signora. I love the blond one. But this one suits you, too. - What shoes, signora? - I'm wearing them, Teresina! I really wanted to give you a present, but I sent my money home. Never mind. Next time. This one looks really pretty on you. It doesn't! I look awful. I won't wear any. I'm sick of this dress! Throw it out. This thing too! Here, you can have it. Signora, do you know what you're getting for your anniversary? Your gift for him is so beautiful. Signora, your husband's here! Get off the bed, you! Hurry, he's in the garden! Let me try it. Teresina, quick, my dress! You know, signora, I feel so excited. How beautiful! Is the other room all set? - Is it all right? - Light the candles. His gift is under his napkin. You've only one earring on! I left it in the bathroom. Get it, please. Turn off the lights. What's the matter? The power's out? What's happening? What are you all doing there? You're right! I'm so sorry. It's so beastly of me! To think I even wrote it down. But I have a surprise, too. Welcome, everyone! It's our wedding anniversary. Juliet, look who's here! Happy anniversary! It's their anniversary. Look. - Lights! - Look what your friend Val brought you. Thanks. What is it? It's a charm against spirits! You must hang it here. - Hi, Juliet. - Let me look at you! It's been 15 years, my friends! That dog's been so nervous for the past two or three days. Down! That's Genius, the greatest clairvoyant on earth. I know everything about you. You're an Aquarius, right? Lots of famous people are. - Always a pleasure to see you! - Don't be bothersome! Astrology is a fascinating science! Say, girls! What's cooking? Juliet, make us something. - Well, what? - Anything. They've made up. He opens his mouth and I get angry. It's so stupid! I'll cook! I'll make my famous pilaf la Dolores! Have you got any paprika? - Red pepper. - Even better. - Let me help. No, it's a secret recipe! Sculpting, cooking and making love: My three vocations! Have you found your conquering angel? I saw you at Vigor, the gym. Never been there. I did some bodybuilding too. Let's see. Romolo, pick me up. What's up, handsome? It's all here in the cards, see. Right? You're so mysterious not even my cards can read you. - And now, signora? - Do we have to feed them all? Sure, they're our guests. Where's Juliet? Can I go? Don't be silly and start crying. Genius, come feel Juliet's vibes! You look like a doll tonight! I've got so much to tell you. Dear counselor, your sister's doubts are no mystery. The Indians already knew everything, like the Egyptians, the Etruscans and the Chinese. Right, last night I dreamt... I'm sorry. This is not the right time. Another time, Val. Sit down. He'll do the pendulum. Clear your mind of all thoughts. Take off my jacket. Yes, maestro. Things are taking a good turn! A strong magnetic charge! This house... who lived here before you? The charge's positive, see? It's moving clockwise. - Who's there? - Me! It's not a good time. - What's up? - Nothing! Are you bad-mouthing me? What's up? Don't just walk in. It's a shock! Sorry for bringing so many people, They dropped by. What could I do? It's fine. They're all very nice. Giorgio. Do you love me? Good luck to you both! To the bride and groom! - Are you married? - Would I cheer if I were? Lying is much more heroic. We'll give you a gold medal, then. Does the lady know she's living with a hero? Sit around the table. Don't cross your legs. I'll purify the air. Cutie... No cats! They attract restless souls! Quiet! Take your sance and... You two can go to bed now. She said she wouldn't do it anymore, it scares me so. Go, go ahead! I feel many presences! They've already gathered. I'm sorry, it's the incense. Focus. Create your inner void. I feel a new presence. Somebody who's never been here is trying to communicate. How's the charge, maestro? Tell it to fill my bottle. It's empty. One... Don't breathe. Two... A longer step, longer. One... Here it is! Speak to it, maestro. Spirit, do you wish to be known? It said "I"... ..."R"... ..."H"... ..."I"... - Didn't it say "H"? - Shut up. It said "I". "S"...Iris. It's a woman. Iris! Such a pretty name! I wonder who she was. Could you tell us who you are? She said she's gorgeous. Right, maestro? Yes, she did. Iris, listen. Are you here with a message for us? She said: "Love for everybody." What a sweet message! Listen Iris, could you tell us... What is it? - Interference, perhaps. Are you still there, Iris? It said: "No." Let's listen. Who are you? Olaf. He said his name is Olaf. You're Turkish, am I right? He said you are Turkish. Send a message for each of us. To help us through this life. What can you tell our friend? - "Whore." - No, you've misunderstood me. Trollop. He says, "Big Trollop." It isn't really an insult. - What was that? - He said "Big Trollop"! Poor soul, rest in peace. Professor, send him on his way. Who's this? They hung up. A message for you, Juliet. Who do you think you are? You're nothing. You don't mean a thing to anybody. You're a derelict! Hold it! Don't break the chain. - What's happening? - Who's feeling ill? Switch the light on, now! Adults playing such games! It was an otherworldly message. Olaf, leave now! Yes, I understand. Ciao. I'm here, silly! You gave us such a fright! Still, this lady is very gifted. Very, very gifted. Elisabetta! Has my husband left? He just left, signora. He didn't want to wake you, because you were up so late. He won't be home for dinner. The nanny took your nieces to the beach. The pond needed some cleaning. The leaves stop up the drains. Bravo, Gasperino. Beautiful day, isn't it? I'd like to fly into the arms The arms of my beauty - Go away. Shall I get the plumber? - Yes, fine. He's from my village. The water tank is still very noisy. "For everybody." "Love for everybody." I'll set the table right away. Iris? Have you ever heard radio transmissions on a plane? The ether is full of voices giving orders. Human voices, voices full of phlegm. Such naivete is offensive to reason. They're electric fields, unidentified substances. What about communications from other planets? - You, be quiet! - Let me speak. I read in Reader's Digest... I'd advise you against these experiments. As a child, I'd just shut my eyes, and I would see... I would close my eyes and see balls! In beautiful colors! Good for you! Castles, nocturnal plants, forests and little tiny faces. They stared at me with sparkling eyes. I was afraid. Still, it was beautiful. It went on for years, and then, nothing. I just had to close my eyes... What if I told you it was just indigestion? When we die, we're a pile of bones. We hope the cat won't get us. Take a swim, buy a horse, jump obstacles. But above all, tell your husband to make love more often. Nothing's better for toothaches and spirits. Yes, I know. There's a real vision! The kind of vision even I believe in. Raffaello, sit down. Please! I'd like them day and night. She's our neighbor, but we're not really acquainted. Ildegarda! You may not be acquainted, but I'd love to be. Mademoiselle, go fetch the girls, please. Rossella, Sabrina! What are you doing there? Don't disturb the lady or she'll get angry. - What about me? - Thank her. Let's go, girls. I'm going for a swim, ma'am. Our dear Juliet sees magic everywhere. "A happy life reigned in Catherine's home. Her husband adored her, her children were growing up strong and hard-working. Naturally, the men in the village set her as an example for their wives. The women began dreading her, like smoke in their eyes. " Juliet, please help me. I'm old. Besides, it concerns you. Dottore, dottore, help me! Juliet, the lady over there sent us this fruit basket. Wasn't that nice? Juliet. - Did you say something, madame? - No. I didn't say a thing. Stop running. Come here. There was a headless fish in the sea. Auntie said if we return it to the sea, the head would grow back. - Did you swim? Aunt Sylva, we saw a fish without a head! Hold still, don't touch! You are filthy. Ciao. I wonder when I can get a house here, too. You're so pale! The little one is pale all over. Did she get any sun? Remember what the doctor ordered? At least two hours of sun each day. With our heads reclining We lose ourselves in a sad flight in destiny's breath That blows through our hair Ciao, Sylva. What a surprise. Adele was getting the girls. We came with Mother. You're running around in this heat? We were going home. The heat isn't bad. - Don't. You're perspiring. - Staying for lunch? No. Rehearsal's at 3:00 at the studio. It's 2:00 already. We're late. When do we meet Luciana? At 4:00. Then it's the dressmaker. Did they bother you? No, they were good company. We had fun together. You look good, Sylva. I lost four pounds. The director wanted me thinner. How's the nightlife? Well, there isn't much to do. I'm usually tired, so we prefer staying in. Your husband is shameless. He invited me to dinner to impress his guests from Venezuela. I said I'd come with my boyfriend. And he says, "Well, next time, then." What gives? Is he ever home? He comes in at night after work. Careful. He'll get burned out. But he said we'll take a nice holiday. We'll go on a cruise. Spain, Greece... he hasn't decided. I have the brochures. - Really? - We're really going. Remember to watch TV Saturday night. I have a great part! See you Sunday. Ciao, Mother. What is it? Nothing, just looking at you. Why don't you put on some makeup, some lipstick? You're right, but we were at the beach. Take better care of yourself. Repeat this movement... Signora, look at Elisabetta. Not the head, just the eyes. Wait a second. Like this. Keep going, faster. Give it 15 days and your eyes will sparkle again like two gems. - Set up a tray by the TV. - No, I'm not hungry. What a tough day! What's this program? - Not even a slice of cake? - No, nothing. I had something at the office. Sit down here for a while. ... always needs a pretty voice and perfect diction. A good exercise. - Are you tired? - Yes, a little. Try to pronounce the following words: From now on, talk to me this way. Pineapple, Domodossola... ... exemption and success! This exercise has been successful for some of the best actresses. I was at the beach today. And now the horoscope... And? I told the doctor about last night. He made fun of me and l... What? Never mind. Ladies and gentlemen, good night. Tomorrow, my dear, is going to be busy again. Elisabetta, call me at 7:00. Have the car ready by 7:30. Gabriella... What did you say, darling? Who's Gabriella? Tell me, who is Gabriella? Good morning. Sleep well? Don't smoke first thing in the morning. After two days, I'm finally meeting with the Brazilians. - What are you doing? - I'm putting it out for you. Ciao, little star. You look great. My back is killing me. Who is Gabriella? - What? - Yes, Gabriella! I don't know. Who is she? You said "Gabriella" twice in your sleep. Really? The book I was looking for. You could've put it back. You must have been dreaming. Who is she? Do I happen to know her? Who? I don't know any Gabriella. You misunderstood. Bye, darling. I'll be back early. I'll call you. Going to the seashore? Go to hell! I'm sorry. Somebody's been calling and hanging up three or four times a day. - What? - Nothing. When he returns from Venezuela, repentant, she says: "So, you're back now?" Gabriella. I heard it all right. He said Gabriella. Still, he looked so innocent. True, he likes women. Am I right, signora? One has to put up with it. You can't force others to do what you want. No, darling. I believe what they tell me. If they say "yes," it can't mean "no," then "yes," then "I don't know." Right, signora? One should not be proud. Still, once he told me: I will never lie to you. Never. Your little house is a dream by day. Watch the dog. There are cats everywhere. Enchanting! Such an intoxicating perfume! Look at the dew. This is dew, isn't it? Such purity. My heart aches, it's all so beautiful. I want to roll around naked in it. Why don't you? I can't. We've become so complicated, so uncivilized. Ciao, stellina. What are you doing? It's wet here, though. Is the humidity bad for your rheumatism? Down, down. No, dear, don't get up. Sit here, Valentina. Move the peppers. What are you doing? Storing peppers for winter. In a wreath? Oh, a wreath of peppers! Such a good little housewife! I am totally useless. I'm so ashamed! Why am I this way, eh? I feel so uprooted, so adrift. Peppers are a tiny thing, yet if I could do it, it might save me. Let's go, Teresina. Nobody thought of lunch today. Will you stay with me, Val? Wake up, Teresina. It's almost noon! What? Noon? I'm supposed to meet Ranieri at 11:00! We have such fights if I'm late! Dear, I'm off, but I'll see you at 5:00 p.m. At 5:00 p. M? Where? Didn't I tell you? That's why I came. You must join us. You can't say no. You must be there. But where? Bishma! Bishma is going to be at the Plaza at 5:00! He only comes to Europe once every seven years! In the US he has disciples, schools, clubs, it's an event. - Really? - Hold still. It's unique. You know his experiments? - Never heard of them. - Where've you been? He's a fabulous clairvoyant. A man-woman with the secrets of both sexes! An oracle. He can change your life, reveal all. - He's an Indian? - Indian, Tibetan... who cares? Bishma belongs to the world! Bye, darling. It's meant to be. Don't miss the meeting! He's here just for you. I can't go. I don't want to miss Giorgio's call. - You'll regret it, Juliet. - Don't wait for me. The electricity's out. Bishma's apartment? The meeting's on the terrace. Show the ladies the way. The elevator's broken. Let's forget about it. Are there lots of people? Has it started already? I don't know. Let's go. Got your questions ready? Questions? What questions? I'm not asking any. When I was little, my dad told me this hotel was for... - Elena! - I was dreading this dark. Hello, my angel. - It has all come to pass. - Of course! That same night, I dreamt of him. No robe, though. What does it mean? Love thy wife as thyself. Those who love their wives love themselves. Love one another for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health. What are you staring at? There's a wedding banquet going on. How nice! Love! That's the second step. It isn't real enlightenment, though. So, what is this? The single spirit. The fruit is only appearance. The real Buddha is beyond such differences. Is that right? That's the third step. Now, though, the truth is close and far away at once: So what is this? Isn't it an apple? Darling, you don't get it. Look beyond appearances. The voice of the master will tell us what it is. It's an apple, a humble apple, a little red and crushed on one side but at the same time it is the Buddha and unity. Things become things again, and the enlightened being sees multiplicity and unity all at once, appearance and substance. Is there a heaven and hell? - Who are you? - An American painter. Let me see. Cut my head off. Go on, cut off her head. It's one of the fables of the great master Lao Tse. Don't hesitate. Cut it off. Behold the gates of hell opening! And now the gates of heaven. What's happening? He's conversing with his god. The lady called Juliet may enter. But on her own. How is he? Where is he? He wants me, alone. Go away! But I brought you! - But he wants me. - Tell me where he is. Well, the bathroom maybe. Wait outside. We've got an appointment. Juliet, do you know the Kama Sutra? Sexual intercourse is a conflict. To be happy, you must behave as if in combat. The place to be fought over is the body. The body? And within the body, the shoulders and between the breasts. The sound that must be produced to procure pleasure is the "Hin." The great sigh. The sound "put." The sound "fut." And the sound "plat." You might add sounds such as those produced by pigeons, ducks, green sparrows, flamingos, quail, and storks. Sounds that can be used depending on the occasion. Different kinds of bites. The blind bite, the breathy bite, the point, the coral jewel line, the torn cloud, the wolf bite. Love is a religion, Juliet. Your husband is your god. You are the priestess of this cult. Your spirit must burn up like this incense, go up in smoke, on the altar of your loving body. Now, if you have any questions, the master will gladly answer. Well, no, nothing. Here's what's happening. It's as if everything's been lost since last night. I'm afraid my husband has another woman. Learn to better please your husband. I do please him. Do you remember me? I was born this way, donna d'amore. Am I not beautiful? Answer honestly, am I not beautiful? - Yes, very beautiful. - I think so, too. Did you see my hair? I never comb it, I simply caress it. I love caressing it. My skin is so white. If I am in a bad mood, I go to the mirror. I turn and look at my back and I immediately feel happy again. Did you buy those stockings? - No. What stockings? The black fishnets. Women want to be treated like angels, but they don't do their job... - Is love a "job"? - I didn't say "job." - I said "the art of love." - I got it right. You said "job." Whoring... some advice! Who are you? Olaf, go away! Become beautiful, like me! Female sensibility... I want to kiss you. Bite my breast. More, more! Please, stop! I want to leave. Let me out. - Calm down, signora. - I want to leave. We shouldn't appeal to our inner forces without the necessary preparation. It could be dangerous. But these spirits are generous, gentle and mild, though at times they might seem teasing. Were your omens good? - Yes, thank you. - Happy? Yes, thanks. Good luck. What did he tell you? We heard... There's another message: Something new will come to pass tonight, new and very beautiful. Sangria, it quenches the thirst of those who drink it. It quenches our secret thirsts too. They call it the potion of oblivion. Strange. That wasn't his voice. A soul speaking through him. Did you hear that? An extraordinary meeting! They told her she'd have an extraordinary meeting tonight. Aren't you happy? - Did you see her? - I thought so. - Did she say, "This is Iris"? - No, but I felt it was her. It felt like the night of our session. Strange. Who do you think it was? Maybe the dancer that ran away with my granddad. A dancer and your granddad? He was a professor and he fell for a dancer. What a beautiful child! What's your name? Tell her, Juliet! See how brave this beauty is. Such an act! I wanted to express my admiration. A beautiful lady makes me more pious. I don't know why, but I liked thinking they ran away on that circus plane. Professor, stop it in the name of God! Come down at once. That's an order. You'll be accountable for this despicable behavior. Professor De Filippis! The headmaster had him expelled. He vanished for two years. Then he came back as happy as ever. Mother didn't allow him to stay with us. I saw him at Christmas and always in secret. He told funny stories. I was a little scared, too. The bishop said he was one of the devil's disciples. I was still a child at his funeral. Mother didn't shed a tear. She wore a beautiful black dress. - She's a beauty. - Yes, she is. One night I saw her in the corridor. She looked like a queen. Perhaps she was going to a ball with my father. Rosa Aurata. A name like poetry. I used to grow them, too. My garden in Cordoba was famous. You're very lucky. Flowers are grateful when loved. These plants get lots of love. It shows. You must be a very loving person to give so much every day. Is this right, sir? Is this the one you wanted? Yes, thank you. Three slices of lemon, three of orange, mineral water. A glass, please. Not a champagne glass. An ordinary one. Teresina, get a large glass. Three teaspoons of sugar. How about this, signora? Will this do? In Valencia they like to add a clove, in Cordoba, a more delicate taste. Tell me if you like it. Delicious. What's it called? Sangria. It quenches the thirst of those who drink it. It quenches our secret thirsts too. They call it the potion of oblivion. ...stay at least a week. Have you already met? I told you about Jos, remember? I was his guest in Spain. - When? Last year, in Castilla. A fabulous palace! And his paintings! Were they by Goya or Velazquez? Neither. Rivera. Beautiful. He wanted to go to a hotel. Where can you find this peace, this quiet? What matters is the fluidity of the movements. The balance. A good toreador must have a pure heart and clear thoughts, like monks or dancers. Jos owns one of the biggest bull farms. Sometimes, at night, this madman puts on his own bullfight. What courage! Isn't it dangerous? No. It's poetry. Poetry's never dangerous. My best friends are toreadors. They compose music, write verse, and abhor blood. Cordoba's style in the arena is pure harmony. May I? Please, wait. I have something more suitable. How's this for a muleta? There's the bull. He dies in his chimera. He is not killed by the sword but by the magic of an elegant illusion. The beast falls into space and I kill it with thrusts of illusion. Miss one step, one measure, like a rhyme in poetry, and you're faced with mortal danger. A calculated spontaneity, a pure sentiment, a clear mind, an exact gesture, and the monster will be defeated. I want you to see Jos's present. I'll get it. It's magnificent. "No one understood the perfume of the dark magnolia of your womb. No one knew you tormented a hummingbird of love between your teeth." You love Lorca's poetry, right? Destiny plays some strange games. I was in Madrid and I didn't want to leave because of a foreboding. Now I am happy to be here. There's nothing to life if you take away nights like this one. I owe you a happy moment and hope it won't be the last. For so little? It can be everything. Yes, a sudden decision, meeting an old friend by the sea, and feeling a lost sense of peace. Everything becomes clear, plausible. Juliet, what is it? Come here. Isn't this a great gift? It's a magic telescope! Last year there was a scandal at their villa. She organizes these parties. The police were called in. They wanted to deport her. There are some fascinating stories about them. She's really beautiful. Going to bed already? I wanted to chat. - Did you say something? - It doesn't matter. - Good night, darling. - I'm going to read for a while. I also changed the color of the interior. Now it's red and the seats brown. Do you like it? I told them: "Boys, it's for a goddess." Sure I didn't wake you? What were you doing? About me? And what were you thinking? Good night, little monster. I'll wake you. I forgot to get my wake-up call. Lucky I remembered. Who were you calling? I told you. The phone company, to wake me up. Want some? Let's go back to bed. Who were you calling? What is it? Come on. - What now? - Let's come back some other time, Adele. Or you go on your own. I am not used to looking ridiculous. - To have him followed, like a thief... - But he is. He stole your youth, your peace, your trust. He's the worst kind of thief. But someone spying on what's going on feels like a threesome. Isn't it a threesome already? You must have faith. Trust them as you would your confessor. They take care of all the rest. I apologize for my disguise, one of the transformations vital to the job. I'm here to help my fellow man when he's in need of information, but are you sure you won't regret it? There's still time. Stop and reconsider. I always recommend a little trip with your spouse, a second honeymoon. Think about the tender memories in your old age. Two white heads on the same pillow. Time wears out suspicion and tomorrow you might be laughing at your fears of today. At our own sufferings? Impossible. My sister must know the truth. You're right. I'm at your service. What does this gentleman do? He gets people together, I don't know... I never understood exactly. A public relations man? That's it. He organizes openings for the fashion industry. Do you have a photo? For our psychologist. Valli! Sorry. I must ask a delicate question. What is discussed here stays within these walls. So, when you look at him... Could you take off your glasses? - My glasses? - Yes. Thanks. Does he blush when you look at him? Make up excuses? I don't think so. Well... Does he speak a foreign language on the phone? Sometimes, with his clients. Do you use pet names when you're intimate? - I don't see... - Pardon. Valli, come in here. I want to have a word with you. I don't see the relevance... Every little thing matters, dear lady. Even the smallest of details. You can't ignore anything. Valli. One of my esteemed associates. Could you give him our subject's photo? Do I really have to leave it? Imperative. See? Pardon my deplorable indiscretion, signora, but my questions aren't over yet. What about lipstick on his hanky? Perhaps a suspicious scent of perfume? A scent of beauty cream, hair on his coat or... forgive me... little scratches on his body? No, never! Let's hear from our psychologist. Looking at the photograph, I say he's about 40, difficult personality, cold rages, a ladies' man. Be careful, 'cause he's capable of rash gestures. Hidden fear. A great need for his mother. And who doesn't need his mother? Very well, dear lady. From now on we will be devoted to your case. Am I right? - Of course. In a week, you'll know everything about your husband. Our zoom lens makes ideas like intimacy and secrecy obsolete. We don't know the word "secrecy." We'll show you the husband you've never known. You'll share his most secret hours. You'll penetrate that shadowy zone you were never allowed into. Are you really determined to know? Woe unto those who shall tolerate sin, for it makes them accomplices. They shall burn with the sinner in eternal fire. Take vengeance in the name of God! I am the Lord of Justice. Yes. I do want to know. I have a full right to know. I no longer know who he is, what is mine, what I am to him. I need to know what he thinks and does. I want to know everything! Everything! Have I gotten big? You'll break the platform soon. Do you like Nadir? After all that trouble, my archangel was right under my nose! He's the doorman's son. There might be some chocolate in the fridge. Have some. You haven't seen my new works. Looking at my statues isn't enough. You must touch them. Try. If I touch them, I shiver. They feel alive. Michelangelo shouted at his Moses: "Speak!" I'd like to shout at these powerful forms: "Love me!" I really would, you know. My art is deeply spiritual. You say no, eh? Let's give back to God his physicality. I was afraid of God. He crushed me, terrified me. And why? I imagined him abstractly. But no. He's got the most superb body ever. In my statues he's a physical God, a perfectly shaped hero that I can desire and make my lover. When I was a child, I imagined God was hiding behind a big door, always closed, very dusty, in the nuns' little theater. That year they were putting on the life of a martyr and they picked me. Juliet, you have such innocent eyes! You look like the saint herself. - Did the saint see God? - Yes. When she flew up to heaven, consumed by the flames of martyrdom. Juliet, swear you'll tell me? - Yes. - Ask Him if He loves me. - Yes. - Really? Yes, Laura, I'll ask Him. Juliet, come. You're on. Arrest her! Bring her before me! Your faith is against the empire, but we are merciful and forgiving. Do you renounce your faith? Will you sacrifice to the emperor? No, never! So you prefer death. Do you accept martyrdom? Yes, I do. You've still got time, if you hold your life dear. I don't care about the clemency you offer me, but about the salvation of my soul. It's the emperor's orders. Burn this Christian at the stake! Stop! Shame on you! This is indecent! I want my granddaughter now! Do as Granddad tells you. Get down now! Enough, in the name of the Lord! Snap out of it! Enough! You snap out of it! I'm perfectly sane! Putting a child on the stake! What are we? Cannibals? Bring that thing down here right now! You wretches! Kids, go home. And you get out of my way! This is crazy! You go up and get roasted, if you dare show your legs! What do you teach these creatures? You'll make madwomen out of these innocents! Go grill each other! Come down from there right now! That's an order! I'm your headmaster! You must obey me! Your behavior is unacceptable! Shut up! "Unacceptable..." And you? You're so quiet. You let them do anything. You enjoy getting fried, silly? Did you see God? Answer me. Did you? Answer! Forget this shameful situation that dishonors our school. Please, accept our heartfelt apologies. Teresina! Where did this cat come from? It isn't ours. I don't know. And such evil yellow eyes. It's from the old villa. Don't move. I'll catch it. Oh, it went inside! Gasperino, lend us a hand. Cats and I, we don't get along. Careful, it might scratch you. Can we keep it? Cats are terrible. They scratch and bite. - They aren't dangerous! - Well, let's hope for the best. - I got it! - Chubby! Cutie! "Suzy." Your name is Suzy. The gate's open! Some place you have here! Excuse me, signora. Health and prosperity. And may God make you each day more beautiful for His glory! Tell us the convent story again. - No. - Come here a moment. - Am I good? - Good? You're an angel. See you tomorrow. Mother, can you take Alyosha? I need to talk. - Yes, you're naughty. - No, professor! You see? He comes here three or four times a day! A very nice boy, but what a mistake falling for my daughter! And my daughter, well, she's... Alyosha, go look at yourself in the mirror. This young man's beauty is inside. You can't see it. But women are seduced by outer splendor. And you, you don't have any visible charm! Nice cat! Just a second! You vagrant! He was in my garden. But now he's back. How kind of you! He's so beautiful he might get stolen. Hear that, silly? You shut up! Ildegarda! Take him! Where were you? Did you thank Signora... - Juliet. - A beautiful name! I'm Suzy. Was he bad? No, he was very good. Good? He's a drunkard. He loves champagne. Oh, the guy on the phone! Are you there? A lady from next door brought the cat back. Sure, all my friends are beautiful. Perhaps... He's so overbearing! Sorry. - Don't mind me. Stay. It was time we met. I don't want to be in your way. - A little champagne? - Thank you. Nothing for you. Stay for lunch! - I really can't. We'll get rid of everybody and I'll cook. I can't open this. I like you all sweaty like that. Don't worry. I don't want a thing from you. Tomorrow you must... - I'll tell Suzy what you've done. It's a tribal secret. Signora, your glasses. Here's the champagne! Great! Paolo, come here. Just a little for you, right? You get really crazy when you drink. Forgive this mess. I'm remodeling, because I'd like more color. Would you like a tour? - Sure. - Come on. How lucky! You can give me a few good tips. Welcome, Juliet! I had a dream about you. In a church. You sat at the professor's desk. I sat in the last row, dressed like a nun. You said, "Let me see how you walk." I walked like this and you flunked me. I woke up crying. Join us at my party this Saturday. Bring your husband, of course. I see you from my window. You two must be truly in love. I'd love to love one man that way. But how? My granny. She hasn't slept in five years. She sits here and sees all, knows all. Granny, this is Juliet. Do you like her? What's wrong, my dear? I get spooked. She's a bit of a witch, too. She sees people and knows their secrets. Everything passes. - Hello, beautiful. - How is she? Better, but I heard wailing all night long. Excuse me a moment. Arlette? It's me. Arlette, please. - Welcome. - Juliet, come here! My lady has a very big heart. You haven't touched your food again. Know what I'll do? I'll call Mrs. Artemia now. She'll set you right. Come on. Up you go. Or I'll tell Roby to leave now! Don't worry, Arlette. She's a friend. She loves you. Right? Of course. Here, have some. Why don't you believe we all love you? I'll come back to see you later. What did she do? Tried to take her life three times. The last time I almost lost her. I called and called. No answer. We had to break down the door. What a sight! Unlucky in love. Here I can keep an eye on her. Like Laura, my schoolmate. She drowned herself at 15. They called it an accident. But she killed herself for love. - Quiet! - Take this one with the feathers. Why are you here? I'm really annoyed now! I told him, "She's going to get angry." Didn't I tell you? You mustn't come here. Got it? You mustn't! - Hands off my stuff! - He only took a slipper! This is my home! You obey me or go back to the streets. You hear me? She was a whore. - You'd like to be a whore, too! Yes, why not? This trollop has some stories! None of it true, of course. We were just joking around. What else can we do? Juliet, how are you? Iris keeps her word. Suzy is your teacher. Listen to her, follow her. I shouldn't encourage your fetishism. 'Cause you are a fetishist! Yes, Momy told me. Keep it. It's a gift. I don't believe fetishism's a good trait. And for a Russian, an appalling one! Ah, come see. I watched you so many times in your garden. Come, Juliet! Look! You have mirrors up there, too? Do you like them? - Yes. It was my idea. Momy loves them. Sometimes it seems there are four of us. God, I hope you won't think badly of me. Men have such funny fantasies, you know! Come on in! The water's warm! Another one of my ideas. After we make love, we slide down. It's great! Take off your clothes and come on in! - No, thank you. Once Momy dove down headfirst. He nearly kicked the bucket. Come on, Juliet. Dive in! I fulfill my desires. I don't deny myself a thing. Look. What's up there? I eat, dance, play, fight! I love fighting! Let's sunbathe. Up there! Much better than the beach. It's my very own sun. Look. There's the switch. - Are we going up there? - Sure! Pull the lever down. There's a convent in Greece on a mountain where the monks get up this way. Send it down again. - Do I lift the lever? Good! Your turn now! Ready? - Yes! Don't be afraid! If your head starts spinning, close your eyes! - Give me your hand. - I can manage. They can look all they want. They'll never find us. - Sure. - We've lost them. - Who? - Those two guys in the car. Didn't you notice? I saw two lovers in those bushes the other day. How they made love! I felt like applauding, they were so good. It looked so delicate, so festive from up here. Is your head still spinning? Let's have a drink. The sun has reached its zenith. The most beautiful hour of the day. No shadows now. Oh, it's full of rain. There are two fish inside. Sit down. Let's undress and sunbathe naked. I'm just fine. Granny mixes up perfumes with wild flowers. Try some. Men get so drunk on it. Once the engineer... What d'you say about your marriage? - Nothing. Don't you trust me? - Yes, but... - So? Tell me. Haven't you ever thought about getting married? No, never. See, I always thought marriage worked this way: I was all his and he was all mine. I'm ashamed to say it, but Giorgio was my first love. I saw him and fell in love. All I wanted was to be with him. He asked me to marry him. I couldn't believe it. He became my whole world: Husband, lover, father, friend, my home. I didn't need anything else. I thought it was the way it was meant to be. I was happy. - They may be at the beach. - Maybe they're gone. - No, there they are! - What are you doing? See? They found us. Naughty boys! We've got something to give you! - Do you know them? - Never saw them before. Tell me about your lovely wedding. Did you know I was to marry at 13? Oh, I dropped my shoe! I'm sorry, it's late. I have to get back home. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Could you let me down? You can come up here whenever you'd like. - Hello. How are you? - Please. There. Won't you stay with us? I get off at the first floor. You stay on. "And among all of these trials was the most terrifying: The labyrinth. The labyrinth is a great palace. Once you've stepped in, you can't leave. The more you wander, the more you lose your way." Here. What's with you today? A little blue, signora. So what did the ogre do? Could I leave early today? Aunty! "But the ogre, who was a true daredevil, said, 'I'll get in the labyrinth."' You may leave, Teresina. "What will you give me if I escape?" But I don't like you leaving every day between 3:00 and 8:00. "They walked through a wood of golden apple trees, so plentiful and so resplendent that even at night it was as bright as day." - Is the lady at home? - Yes. Who's speaking? A friend. Just a second. Go play outside. Go ahead. We'd like to see you. Could you come this afternoon? Today? I don't know if today... Have you found something already? We spent seven rather busy days, but I think you'll appreciate our work. - Can't you tell me over the phone? - Honestly, it's not our policy, you do realize... - Of course. - We'll be waiting then. I'll do my best. My respects, signora. I honestly think we have some outstanding results. Maybe we can show you what you wanted to know. I can see your worries, but do believe me, nothing is irreparable. Please, sit down. If you only knew how many couples reconciled here. A little drink? The only way to truly love is to really know each other. St. Augustine's words. Today isn't a defeat. The shots aren't always in focus, but consider the conditions my men had to work in. Here are the first three days. From the 23rd to the 25th. I'll read the enclosed report. "On the 23rd, subject left at 7:30, wearing white suit. A car follows him from home to a florist's." Needless to say, we have all the data on the recipient of this floral homage. Here she is going into a restaurant. The hat makes positive identification impossible. See, signora. I suggest our clients consider all they see with a little detachment. See, our objective point of view is limited. Perception and reality are two different things. This could be innocent. Is that Lake Bracciano? No, a field below the castles. "On the 24th, an afternoon trip to the Appian Way. Stopped in the fields, from 4:20 to about 6:00." The girl's name is Gabriella Olsi. Let's look at the slides while I change reels. I shot these personally. The tape recorder. We also taped a conversation between them in a park. My God. That wasn't me. When we met you had another... When I met you When I met you There was the moon You should be flattered I'm showing my jealousy. It bothers me. - Should I change? - You're perfect. The interpretation is up to you. What can we say? We're the exclusive holders of this material, to be exhibited only in court. And only if subpoenaed. equipment, per diems, overtime, etc. Your invoice, signora. And believe me, we've treated you fairly. Our respects, dear lady, and allow us to express our wish that it all turn out for the best. Have a good time, madam. Here's our charming neighbor. I knew you'd come. How are you? Your husband's been punished? He's not back yet. My husband is always late. He works. He works a lot. So I came by myself. He's got complete trust in me. And he's completely wrong. You've met my mother. Best not to wake her or she'll start singing. Masku has Maometto guiding his hand. Momy, this is Juliet. Thank you for honoring my house. Know who that is? That's Momy, my fianc. He's 65 years old. And he wants to make love every day. And he does! What's up? You look so sad. Sad? Me? Not at all. I'm fine. Actually, I feel like having fun. Good! And I feel like hugging everybody. Here. I want you to be happy. Your attention, please. This is the most intimate and secret moment. Now Tudefonde has captured the winds, and each girl is the maid servant of purification. An ancient Egyptian rite of passage between life and death. I am the goddess of vice. An hour with me might kill you, but you'll reach the heights and depths of pleasure. This is my hour. At 11:00 I reach the peak of my desire. This is a game in Lola's honor. We simulate the atmosphere of a brothel. How amusing. Then you stare into a man's eyes. There, this one, with the big nose. Can't such a gentleman decide? - Is this fine? - Great, perfect! - I offer a week in Japan. - Shame on you. - Fine, two weeks. - Tightwad! - It's Japan! - Don't listen. On your knees. - What's your name? - Ildegarda. - No, your name is Sex. - Sex. - No, your name's Womb. - Womb. No, your name is now the name of the goddess. You're not yourself anymore. You're the door, the soil, the bed of divinity. You're very pretty. Are you a model? Would you know a Gabriella? - Who? - Gabriella Olsi. - Sure, I know her. - I hear she's a beauty. - Yes. - More than me? She's very beautiful. Also a slut, right? You can tell me, you know. It's becoming sort of a compliment. Do I play my part well? Lola, don't you think she's perfect? He's my godchild. Nice, huh? I'm up here. Juliet, come up. Go away! What is it? He's waiting. He wants you. The champagne. Suzy is your teacher. Listen to her, follow her. I must have drunk too much. Juliet, what are you doing? I'm late, right? - How are you? - Have you seen Juliet? No, I haven't. Where are you going? To your confirmation? What are you doing? - They're analyzing my wife. - Oh, is the American doctor here? Try to stay focused and remember everything. I want to see what happens when your turn comes. - This is very dangerous! - I know you're afraid. No, Giorgio, please. In every psychodrama, each one of us must contribute to the truth. We must create an atmosphere of total, absolute truth. Look, I don't think I'm the right person! Try to re-enact that scene. You're reproaching your brother-in-law. Would you like to play this lady's brother-in-law? - The counselor is a little too old. - I'm flattered. Fine, let's have this young good-looking man. It'll certainly work out better. I'm sorry. I was reading his palm. I don't understand! I want to tell you something. Come here. Don't tell me about the future, but about today. Forgive me. I won't do it again. Signora, they're waiting for you. Yes, I'm coming. Enough! Leave me alone! Barefaced liar! I'll never again believe a word you say. Leave! Out! - Teresina, who are you talking to? - Nobody, ma'am. - Who were you talking to? - Nobody. - Who's there? - Come on. Everybody's waiting. Let me play this psychodrama. There's a dark spot in my life that has left me... Good morning, everyone. - Sit down. - Hello, Mother. - Finally. - Hello, Adele. - Care for a drink? - No, thanks. Not now. Dr. Miller has proposed a new game: The psychodrama. We reenact our anguishes, projecting them onto somebody else. Interesting. Right? - Yes. I've seen certain people among your guests. Love the kimono. Your eyes are bloodshot. Have you been crying? I find these games utterly boring. Remember not to fly on the 27th. May we pay homage to the lady of the house? So pretty! Of course, with such a beautiful mother... I'll bet you it's a boy. Don't forget I told you. Juliet, listen. This isn't a game. You with that sad face, why not try? Yes? Quiet! It's Juliet's turn! Perhaps she doesn't feel like it. - Yes, I do. I'm absolutely fine. - She does, she does. It's an amazing psychological experience. You'll feel set free. It's like seeing oneself in a mirror. - You get straight to your sore spot. - Don't be afraid. Tell us about a painful event in your life. Try to recall here, with us, the place, the people, the circumstances. Can you evoke the atmosphere that characterized that event? Can you really help me? Here they come again. Go away! Go away! - What are you saying? - Nothing. It's just a game. - Let me have this. - Okay. Cut down on cigarettes. Follow your doctor's advice. Can't you see them? Hear them? "Get revenge." "Forgive." Who should I believe? "Make yourself beautiful." "Life is a sacrifice." "Be more feminine. We'll teach you." My life is full of people talking, talking! Go away! Get out, all of you! Water. When I need something absolutely pure, something sincere, I always ask for water. Simple things are so important in life. Things that don't conceal something else. Water is like a sincere glance that conceals nothing. Don't be afraid of the truth. The truth sets us free. After all, who cares about other people's opinions? In my country there's a saying: "I am my own roof, window and hearth. I feed upon my words and drink from my thoughts. Therefore I am happy." Are you real, yes or no? And what advice can you give me? Tell me, what should I do? I wouldn't know. I just want you to live happily. And Giorgio? Where is he? - Do you know what he said? - Quiet!
