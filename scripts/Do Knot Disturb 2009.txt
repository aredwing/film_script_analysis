Somebody will see us. No one has seen us for the past one year. How would anyone see us now? Please come on. - No, Mangu. Mangu! - Who's it? Mangu! Mary, how can you.. No, sir. Mangu touches me. He harasses me all the time. No, sir. Whatever she said in English is all wrong. Sir, if I have done something wrong, then so has she. We both are in this together. Together? Let her go! Let her go! Get out of here. Having fun, alone! I lost my job because of this mere thing. Don't worry. You carry on, please. Wake up, Mohan. Get up. Don't sleep for such late. Wake up. Come on. Come on. Darn this phone! Good morning, sir. What's happening? It's been two hours. Nothing's happening. It was just starting and you called up. I asked you what time is it. Did you call up to ask this? Is your watch not working? It's 1 1 :55 am. I should get a call exactly at 1 1 :58 am. Wake up, Mohan. Get up. You.. Good morning. - You scared me. Why do you wake me up every morning? It's Sunday. Let me sleep. Along with Sunday, it is the special loving day. It's Kiran's day today. No work, only play. I'll make you laugh, serve you food and drink.. ..I'll give you a bath today and.. Just a minute. Yes. Hello. How often have I told you not to disturb me on Sunday? It's all right. - Sir, is your wife next to you? Or on your lap? Shut up! What happened, darling? I know this meeting is important. But I don't care. Really? Which meeting? Meeting at home or outside? Cancel the meeting, I say. This day is for my wife. Hello? - But.. - Hello? Don't cancel the meeting. He's coming. - Ok. Darling, but.. - No. This is the order of the owner of the Saxena Group of Industries.. ..not your wife's and you're just an employee. Remember? That's why, go on. No. No. You insult me so sweetly. I love you. Quickly! Quickly! Go. Don't miss the meeting. - Okay. - And Raj.. Yes.. - ..I hope it's only a business. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. She's a beautiful woman. Beautiful. She's a beautiful woman. She's a beautiful woman. Beautiful. She's a beautiful woman. Her eyes are beautiful. Her talks are beautiful. Her face is beautiful. Her style is beautiful. Fantastic style. She's different. She's just great. Beautiful! She's a beautiful woman. Beautiful. She's a beautiful woman. She's a beautiful woman. I am crazy about your attitude. You don't know what I am. I can open up my heart for you to see. You're the only girl I need. Fantastic style. Fantastic style. She's different. She's just great. Beautiful! Beautiful woman. Beautiful. She's a beautiful woman. She's a beautiful woman. Beautiful. She's a beautiful woman. She's a beautiful woman. Beautiful. She's a beautiful woman. She's a beautiful woman. - Hey man.. Move.. Hey, stop that. My baby is beautiful.. - Dolly. Hey Mister, why are you disturbing my shoot? Can't you see? She's a beautiful woman. - Shut up, old man! Is he crazy? - Somebody stop him. Oh God.. My wife is just great. She loves me, but she's also bossy. Don't touch me like this. Don't touch me like that. Don't touch me like this. If I don't touch her, how can I love her? If I don't love her, she says, Nobody loves me. Hey, Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Hey, Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly, you look so beautiful and fresh today. Are you okay? Diesel showed up today. - Did he misbehave with you? - No. Raj, I dumped Diesel for you. But you couldn't dump Kiran for me. You love me, but you're still her husband. What husband? She scolds me all the time as if I'm her servant. She says she owns the house, the business and the cars. But you still live with her, don't you? I'm not living with her. Naughty. Just like a master provides a servant's quarters.. ..she has provided me with the bungalow. I've been reduced to a paying guest. Why don't you leave her bungalow and live in my flat? It's just a matter of a few days. Raj, I've been hearing this since six months. You'll have to take a decision today. Do you want a bungalow or this flat? You decide. The way these two are troubling me.. ..I'll shift to some guest house. Hey, Dolly! Dolly! Dolly!.. Hey, Dolly! Dolly! Everything has gone wrong because of Maggi. I didn't do anything and I was fired. Oh, God! Hey, Dolly! Dolly! Dolly!.. Dolly! Dolly, listen to me. Listen to me once. I don't want to hear anything. I said everything upstairs. He's using the same transformer.. ..to run the bulb at home and the tube light outside. He punished me for loving someone. And he is having fun with that girl. Come here, Dolly. - I don't want to hear anything. You decide. Sir, you got happy with my work and gifted me this mobile. Watch what I gift you with this gift. Bless the mobile company who included a camera with the phone. Here I come. Cool. Check me, I am cool. Watch me I am cool. You are come cool. Good morning, sweetheart. Good morning, love. - You look happy. Obviously. - Will you have breakfast at home or outside? What's this? What's this? And if this is true, then who is this guy who looks like me? He's not your look alike. It's you. Tell me the truth. What were you doing with this girl? To tell you the truth, I'm not doing anything with this girl. Stop it, Raj. - I'm just standing there. And I'm waiting for my driver. How would I know that she's already standing there? Are you trying to say you don't know this girl.. ..when I can clearly see you're very close to her? Love, you can see that I'm close to her. - Yes. You can see clearly that this girl is standing close to me. - Yes. But can't you see who is standing close to this girl? Who is it? Who is he? - Who is he? Who is he? That's what I'm asking. Who is he? Who is he? Her boyfriend. How do you know that he's her boyfriend? Love, I was standing there and he came in a rickshaw. The moment he got out, he started kissing her. Stop it, Raj. - This is what she said to him. And then she left with him in a car. So who was he? He was her boyfriend. Boyfriend. Are you telling the truth? Love, have I ever lied to you? Oh, thank God. - Oh, thank God.. Oh that's me. Now I can serve you breakfast. In such a little time I got all kinds of thoughts. And I, too, got all kinds of thoughts in that little time. Do all that. The rest is okay.. is that clear? Good morning, sir. What is so good about this morning? It's his style. It was lucky that this guy got included in this photograph. Otherwise Kiran would have found out the truth. I told her that this guy is Dolly's boyfriend. Really? And she believed you? Mr. Buntu, my wife is great. When she believes something, she doesn't know the truth. When she knows it, she gets confused. When she gets confused, she knows it's the truth. That's why she's the owner of this company and you're the CEO. And you may or may not remain in the future. Stop your nonsense. This is not nonsense. If she finds out the truth.. ..you'll lose your millions and be thrown on the streets. Hey! - Don't be physical, dude. Listen! Try to understand. Frankly speaking. Your qualifications will not even get you a decent job. Don't forget that I am your boss. Are you pacifying me? Or scaring me? I'm scared myself, Raj. And I'm pacifying you. There's only one solution. - Yes. Only one solution. Forget your girlfriend forever. Not forever, but for a few days. In the mean time, I want this guy. What? This guy? No. No. This is not right. You're better off with your girlfriend. I'm talking about using him, not misusing him. I want him so that I can convince Kiran.. ..that he is indeed Dolly's boyfriend. If fact, he is Dolly's boyfriend. Have a seat why are you standing? You're very cute. You think this is easy, right? How do we search for him in this big city of Delhi? And if we do find him, how can we be sure.. ..that he'll do as you tell him to do? You'll convince him. Got that? Please do this for me. - No. No. Please. - No. No. Do it! - Okay. This is how you get things done in Delhi. Kiran? 'Amazing, her skin hides her age.' 'She has not changed since her college days.' 'Is she a girl or Berger Emulsion paint?' 'Dust and dirt haven't affected her beautiful youth.' Oh my God! BP? You? After so many years? According to your husband, this girl is this guy's girlfriend.. ..and not your husband's. No, I'm not sure. - But I feel something's fishy. Which is why I'm here. Because I knew only one person could help me. Who is that? You. I trust you. Don't worry, Kiran. If there is a blot on your husband's character.. ..I'm nothing less than Aerial.. ..which finds out hidden blots and stains. Thank God! That's what I expected of you. But I regret one thing, Kiran.. ..why did God do this to you? Nunnu. Why did God do this to you? Nunnu. - Why did God do this to you, Kiran? Nunnu, I understand. Nunnu.. Why with you? - Nunnu! I understand. - I'm with you, Kiran. I'm with you. Hello. Nice to have you back. Ma'am, this is your salad. - Thank you. Just a second. Hello. - Hello. Yes, Mom? - Dear, where are you? Mom, listen to me.. - Did you get the money? Mom, I'm working. I've been hearing that since a long time. Did I raise you to see you not even.. ..pay your mother's medical bill? Aunt, tell your son to pay the bill by 4:00pm.. ..otherwise you'll be thrown out of the ward. Did you hear that? Hello, sir. I was about to call you. Good morning. Give me one week. I'll arrange for the entire amount. Sir.. There he is. Catch him! Your men came here so quickly? Mom! So sorry. Thank you. Sir, your order. Your pizza. Saw that? The whole world knows that Buntu likes pizzas. Thank you. - Move! Not me. Catch him! Govardhan! Govardhan, what are you doing? Where are you running away with the pizza? Get the pizza or you will be trash by me. Why are you spoiling my business, Govardhan? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Take a step forward and I'll throw this plate at you. Stop! Tell Fernandes, when I get some money I'll repay him. Stop. Stop. Have patience. We're not here to take money from you. We're here to give you money. You'll give me money? I didn't follow you, sir. Put him down. Put him down. Sir, money.. Do you know this girl? Yes, this is Miss Dolly. She's an item queen. She's my babe. My.. - Hey, Stop. Relax. control. Control! Relax. Control. - You'll have to live with her for a few days. You're joking, sir. - You can't believe it, can you? Not at all. - Me too. I'm ready to live with her, but why will she live with me? Thank you, sir. Thank you very much you thought I'm worthy of this job. And don't worry. I've understood your problem. But..but I can't do this. What do you mean you can't do it? I've not called you here to make you a manager. I mean, why can't you do it? Sir, the problem is that my mother's extremely sick. And she's in the general ward. And she's not being looked after properly. Why are you crying? I'm here. Your mother is like my mother. Buntu. - Yes? Shift his mother to a comfortable deluxe room. - Okay. And the doctor has said that if I want my mother to get well soon.. ..I should take her to a hill station nearby. For example, Switzerland. We'll send her to Lonavala or Khandala. Switzerland is too far away. It is far away for people like us. It's very near for people like you. Your mother is like my mother. Buntu. - Yes. Send her. I've done it for you. Yes. We don't have an AC and this heat has really troubled my mother. If we could get a cheap house worth Rs.5 or 6 million.. ..to install the AC then.. - A house worth Rs.5 or 6 million is not cheap. That's very costly. It's costly for people like him. For us businessmen.. Buntu. - Yes. Go now. Yes, sir. My mom's backache has made her suffer. We used everything from Iodex to Moov. But her backache was not cured. To top it you have these Delhi roads. How long? How long will my mother travel in a rickshaw? Mother? Which car do you want? Mercedes or BMW? We can do with a Maruti. Why? Won't it be too small for you? Small? It's too big for people like us. - Yes. It's small for.. And you'll give Rs.50000 or Rs.60000 for the maintenance.. ..without my asking for it. - No. I'll throw you out of here. Got it? - Buntu. - What? Do I look like a fool? I'd better be in the photograph than here. Sir, make him understand. - Why don't you understand? Before you disappoint me.. ..remember that it's me in the photograph. If I go away disappointed, your wife will.. - Listen. Listen. I've heard all that you've said. Somehow you'll have to convince my wife.. ..that Dolly is your girlfriend. Yes, sir. And you shouldn't forget that Dolly is my girlfriend. If you forget it, then there's a deluxe room next to your mother's. I'll send you there.. Listen to me. My son will be here with the money. - Aunt.. Wait. Where are you taking me? - Aunt.. listen to me. Where are you, Govardhan? I carried you in my womb for nine months.. ..couldn't you keep me in this hospital even for a day? Govardhan! Instead of giving me a son like this.. ..God, you could have left me childless. Govardhan? You're sitting here? They had thrown me out of the ward. Mom, you'll not be in that general ward now. You'll be in the deluxe room. You have biscuits, flowers and also a phone. You can talk to your son whenever you want. Mom! Mom, now you'll sleep in an AC room. You'll not only watch soaps on this TV.. ..you'll watch the repeat telecasts as well. And whenever you want you'll call out the ward boy with style. What's your name? - Sakaram. You'll call out like this, Sakaram, come here. Sakaram, bring me some water. Mom, how will you say that? But, Son, all this.. - Mom, I'll tell you everything later. Call out to him. Sakaram, come here. - Yes. Sakaram, bring me some water. - Right away. Be happy, Son. - Did you see that, Aunt? Didn't I tell you? The son who you thought was good-for-nothing.. ..is not like that. - Yes. But he's very nice. Oh yeah. Come on baby, get me. Come on. Come on. It's so good to be rich, isn't it? What are you doing, Govardhan? Rich people don't drink tea. They drink juice. Hi. 'He told me to live with one and he sent over the other.' Hello? Oh, that. You know, I'm sorry to disturb you. My car broke down and I needed to use a washroom. Can I use yours? How sweet of you! Very, very nice of you. It's such a lovely house. Do you live here alone? Yes. Oh, really? All alone? Yes.. The washroom? The washroom is also great. It's very nice. Hello, darling. Interesting. Hi. Hi. What's this? Haven't you finished your breakfast yet? I know. You won't eat till I feed you myself. How sweet! - You love me very much, don't you? Don't worry about me. I was just leaving. Girlfriend? Yes. - Of course. She's lovely. Just lovely. Bye. See you. Washroom? Changed my mind. Next time. Bye. As Raj had told you, I'll have to live with you for a few days.. ..just to convince his wife Kiran, who was just here.. ..that we're in love. Sure. It's so hot in here. Don't you have an AC? No. I want to freshen up. Where's the washroom? This is the bedroom. What? - I mean, this is the bedroom.. ..the washroom's that way. Excuse me! - What? Why doesn't your washroom have so many of my photographs? Photographs.. Sir, I have a request. If you give my salary in advance.. Salary? What salary? Which salary? What salary are you talking about? You've ruined by business. There's no customer in sight. And you're asking for your salary? First, remove that. - What? Remove that. - That what, sir? Remove that bow. - Bow? Then remove your shirt. - Shirt? Then your trousers. - Trousers? Remove your coat. Why should I remove my clothes? You've ruined me. Why shouldn't I take away your clothes? - Sir. You've raised my BP. You've increased my sugar. - Sir. You've ruined my health. - Sir, easy.. What else.. - Sir. Sir? Sir, your BP? - It's all right. Your sugar? - It's normal. Sir, your health. - It's great. Sir, your excitement.. - It's over the top. Sir, why is that so? Dolly! Dolly? Dolly. - Dolly? Dolly. Dolly? Dolly. Sorry Sir.. - Dolly! What's this? Aren't you ready yet? We're going to be late. Darling. - Dolly! Hello. - You've come to me? I would have come to you if you had wanted. I am D.S. Bhandari. D.S. is for Dil Se. And Bhandari is for just Bhandari. How sweet! Gobar's ( cow dung) boss. - Gobar? Govardhan's boss. - Yes. And a huge fan of yours. Such a huge fan.. Such a huge fan.. I can't tell you how huge. If you don't mind, can I take him out for lunch? - Lunch? You can take him out for dinner. Or for breakfast. Gobar, go with her. - Yes. Dolly, excuse me. Sir, can I talk to you privately? Please. I'm such a big fan of yours. Such a huge fan.. - Sir. Can I talk to you for a minute? Do I have to let go of her hand? You have to let go of her hand, sir. Yes sir. It's slipping. - Yes, sir. Please come. - Oh, Dolly. Why are you sitting so far away? Sit here. There? - Yes. Okay. Why are you going away? I can't come too close, Miss Dolly. Come closer. Detective. - Detective? Detective. Nice. - Kiran, why did you bring me to this restaurant all of a sudden? It's a surprise. We'll have a romantic lunch together. - Sure. It's a beautiful place, isn't it? - It is. Another surprise. Isn't it the same couple? You got included in their photograph by mistake, isn't it? And you were suspecting me unnecessarily. Hi. - Hi. Wow! They seem to really be in love. It's lovely. Really. - Too much love. Your order, sir. Cook the cottage cheese properly on a high flame. Put the roti in a hot oven and fry if properly on both sides. Cut the tomato that it would be great to see. Darling.. - And chop the onion.. Darling, are you ordering him or murdering him? Say it politely. Cancel the order. Take it again from her. Ma'am.. Mr. Raj.. Naughty, yes that's me. Naughty, yes that's me. Just a second. - Wait! Toilet. Do people go to the toilet in this situation? People go to the toilet only in this situation. Let go off me! Govardhan! Are you taking a leak? Sir, coming. Sir, hit me. Please hit me. You wouldn't have liked it after you saw what I was doing. If I didn't like it while doing it, how could you like it? The one, whom you were getting close to, is my girlfriend. I wasn't watching a world cup match to get entertained by it. Sir, we were play acting. - How can you be such a good actor? Enough. I'm going out, sir. - What will you do outside? I'll go out and tell your wife.. - Tell my wife what? I'll tell her the truth. Are you crazy? Why would you do that? Why would you do that? You're very angry, sir. - Who says I'm angry? Then why are you washing my face? I'm not washing your face. I'm getting fresh. I'm not angry. I feel like hugging you. I feel like loving you so much that it would be too much. Control your emotions. I've also controlled myself. Will you now remember that she's my girlfriend? Yes, sir. Where are we going to sleep? Us? Not us. You. You'll sleep on the bed and I'll take the couch. Oh, no. Who is flashing this light? Kiran's detective is on night duty. Let's pull the curtains and go to sleep. Madam, we can pull them only if you have any. - What? There are no curtains in the room. What do I pull? Your house doesn't have windows or curtains? Yes, this is what happens in the house. If you have shampoo, there won't be any water. I might have a bulb, but there won't be a holder. Okay. Then we'll just have to manage. We'll have to sleep on the same bed.. ..so that he doesn't suspect us. Ladies and gentlemen, we're here to discuss.. ..body meeting.. I mean general body meeting.. Excuse me. Yes, Buntu, tell me what happened? Both the players are on the field. And they are staring at the bed just like.. ..two captains stare at the pitch before the toss.. ..wondering whether this pitch is better for batting or bowling. What? Just a minute. Hold your breath, sir. Your girlfriend is lying down on the bed. And what is he doing? Sir, I guess he's wondering. What? Whether to lie next to her or not? No, sir. He's wondering where he should lie. To the left or to the right of your girlfriend. Oh, my God! What's happening? What happened? What happened? - Nothing. Nothing can happen these days. Okay? He jumped onto the bed. Get up. Get up. Get up, you scoundrel. Be seated, please. Excuse me. Be seated. Come here. What? Torch. He put his hand in the blanket and removed a torch. Why is he torturing her with a torch? I don't want to see any magic show there. Give me your hand. Hand? - Give me your hand. Detective. The show is about to begin, sir. His hand is all over your girlfriend's body. Hands up! Both have settled down on the bed and are sleeping so close.. ..it appears like someone has loaded two SIM cards in a single mobile. Stop outgoing. Stop outgoing. What do I stop? What do I stop? I can see clearly that his leg is over your girlfriend's body. Pick up the legs! Not you sweetheart. Not you. Detective. Dolly, I've been searching you since so many days. And you are hiding here? You? - I'm your husband. - Pipes these days.. Him? - Hello. - So he's your lover? - Him? Please. - That bloody.. No, no. Listen, I'm a plumber. I came here to fix the tap. Madam, tell sir that you'll have to change this pipe. Okay, have a good day. Thank you. - You know that scoundrel? Stop it. That's the reason why I left you earlier. What's your name? - Go.. Go.. Go.. What's your name? - Pappu. Pappu plumber. Pappu, why don't you tell Dolly how much I love her. Madam Dolly. What's your name? - Diesel. Madam Dolly, why don't you understand? He loves you very much. Saw that, Dolly? Pappu understood everything. I love you so much, Dolly. Don't cry, sir. Everything will be alright. Someday, Pappu. If I find him someday.. Then what will you do? Madam Dolly. Who was he, Madam Dolly? He was my past. - And Mr. Raj? - He's my future. But you're my present, Pappu. - Mummy! Bebo. Now I understand why my husband.. ..wasn't able to sleep last night. You know, Nunnu. It hurts a lot to see someone else's nameplate.. ..on your property. - It does, Kiran. It does. Nunnu, do one thing for me. Somehow, go and put curtains on the windows of that house. What a superb idea! - Me? - I'm great. Yes. - Curtains? Yes. - Detective? - Of course. But what will happen by that, Kiran? - What'll happen? If this is how Raj is with the open window.. ..just imagine what'll happen behind curtains. Good idea. I'm going. - Where? - To buy curtains. Hi, Madam Dolly. - Hi, Govardhan. - Hi. Curtains. So you finally put the curtains. - Yes, curtains. Curtains? - Yes. - I didn't put these curtains. Then? - Then. Got it. Definitely sir must have put them. He anyway has a habit to put curtains on everything. That he does. God, these lights. - Don't take this light lightly, Govardhan. He's a detective. - So what will we do? We'll close the window and go to sleep. And we'll shut the curtains in such a way.. ..that the people watching us won't be able to close their eyes. Bebo. Look, where are going, girl? Bebo. Bebo. She met me here. She met me here and there. Why, how and where did she meet me? She met me here. She met me here and there. Bebo. Bebo. Bebo. She met me here. She met me here and there. Why, how and where did she meet me? She met me here. She met me here and there. Bebo. Bebo. Bebo. Go. Go. Go. Let it go. Let the fragrance of love come to me. My heart went crazy when I saw you.

Where are you going stop there. O you got the look. Got the look. Yes, you got the look. Oh, my Bebo. Oh, my Bebo. She meets me in my dreams. She meets me in real life. She's still away from my tempted lips. He doesn't listen to me. He's absolutely crazy. I'm afraid something might happen in this situation. Go. Go. Go. Let it go. Don't come near, don't come my way. My heart went crazy when I saw you. Yes, you got the look. You are my beloved. Where are you going, stop there. O you got the look. Got the look. Yes, you got the look. Yes, you got the look.

Bari Barsi had gone out, he brought back Bebo. Bebo. Bebo. Bari Barsi had gone out, he brought back Bebo. Bebo. Bebo. Bari Barsi had gone out, he brought back Bebo. Bebo. It's the will of God. He makes us meet anyone anywhere. I can't believe you're swinging in my arms. Take me into your arms and forget everything. The one who gets a gift like me is very lucky. Go. Go. Go. Let it go. Don't come near, don't come my way. My heart went crazy when I saw you. Yes, you got the look. You are my beloved. Where are you going, stop there. O you got the look. Got the look. Yes, you got the look. Yes, you got the look. You are my beloved. Where are you going, stop there. O you got the look. Got the look. Yes, you got the look. Oh, my Bebo. Oh, my Bebo. Oh, my Bebo. Oh, my Bebo. Hello. Before I do anything, tell me what's happening there. What to tell you, sir? The whole fun has got spoilt. The weather has gone bad. There's a curtain on the pitch. Where's the cricketer? Who's balling? I mean where are both the players? What are they doing? Whatever they're doing, they must be doing it.. ..behind the curtains. What do I know? - What? I told him to put curtains on a lie. He put the curtains on the window? What business I sent him for.. ..and what business is he doing. What do you think? What they must be doing behind curtains? Sir, they must be playing Ludo behind the closed curtains. You're talking nonsense, sir. What all people do behind closed doors.. ..who can know it better than you? You just hold, Bantu. You just hold. I'll take Govardhan on the second like. I'm making food for my beloved. Hello. - Yes, Govardhan? What's all this? What are you doing? What can anyone do so late at night, sir? One can do a lot of things if he wants to. You tell me what you are doing. - I.. I'm sleeping, sir. - And what's Dolly doing? Even she's sleeping. Why are both of you sleeping together? What does it mean? No, sir. We aren't sleeping together. Both of us are sleeping alone. - How much alone? Absolutely alone, sir. - But how much is absolute? Tell me the distance. She's sleeping far away on the bed.. ..and I'm sleeping standing here. Stop talking and move the curtains. Move the curtains, I say. I opened it. - Darling. - Just hold for a second. I'm on hold, sir. - Now tell me what's he doing. Don't ask me what he's doing. Ask what all he's doing. Why are you doing everything you're doing? Sir, I'm not doing everything I'm not, sir. Then why is he telling me that you're doing many things? I'm telling you, Govardhan. Close the curtains. Close the curtains. Yes, I'll close them, sir. I closed them. Don't you feel ashamed doing everything.. ..you are doing with the curtains open? What am I doing, sir? I'm just standing. Oh, so you're standing alone. Are you fooling me? Come on, open the curtains. Open the curtains. Open the curtains again? - Open the curtains. Wait a minute, sir. I'll open them right away. I've opened them, sir. Come, darling. Come here. What is he doing now, Bantu? He's doing the same thing that he was doing earlier. He's stuck to your girlfriend.. ..like network's to a cell phone, battery to a handset. Why are you sticking to her? Sticking. - Love you. Don't hang up. Don't hang up! Wait a second, Bantu. You hang up. I'll hang up anyway. You hang up as well. Your girl's gone. Govardhan, the things that you're doing at the window.. ..stop them immediately. I'm explaining things you, Govardhan. I don't want any kind of probability. I don't want any tragedy.

If we don't end this game soon.. ..then Dolly, who went there for a week.. ..might settle down permanently with Govardhan. That can never happen. It can happen. I've told you so many times. You should never mix your wife with another woman. I told you about your lover. Now hear your wife's news. What happened to Kiran? Nothing has happened to her. But she has found out about your affair with Dolly. And she's leaving the house. - No! Listen to me. If you don't stop Kiran soon.. ..you'll lose your lover as well as your wife.

Then you might also not remember.. ..that I gave you this watch ten days ago. And this chain, too. By the way, where are you going? Disco. - Then keep this kiss in mind. Get going. Who is it? Oh. Brother Diesel. Happy New Year. Did you find your girlfriend? Look. I've found her boyfriend. You're fooling me till now by pretending to be a plumber. I still haven't hit you. I'll explain it to you. I've ended up in this snap by mistake. This is Raj. Raj is Dolly's boyfriend. What? - Believe me. You think about it. How could a girl who has had her breakfast.. ..at the Taj International like you.. ..have lunch in a tacky and cheap restaurant like me? That's true. Yes. And before this Raj leaves for a honeymoon with Dolly I've fixed it just now. Have dinner. You catch him. And beat him to an inch of his life. And don't even think that you've finished.. ..taking a course on anger management. Happy New Year. Your new year could never be a happy one. Brother, why? What is this? And if there is something. Who is this person who looks just like me? This is not someone who looks like you. This is you. You're mistaken. This is not me. I can clearly make out that it's you and Dolly. I see. You can see me and Dolly clearly. And you can't see this rogue who's eyeing Dolly. Rogue. Pappu Plumber. He has told me the entire story about you. If he has told you the story, then let me tell you the truth. Neither is he Pappu and nor is he a plumber. His name is Govardhan. And look, how he is eyeing her. Brother Diesel. But I haven't seen him myself. At Dolly's house fixing a tap. You've also fallen for his trickery. Look, whom did you first see in Dolly's house? Did you see me or him? - Him. And whom did you see when you arrived in this hotel? Did you see him or this man? I am confused. I'm looking in this direction. Where is he looking? Hey Mangu. - Yes. Come here. Why are you grabbing him? He's the one who's going to explain. He's the one who's going to explain. He's the one who's going to explain. Look here Mangu. You decorated my room, but why? Him. Him. Did you see that? Now before he is through with the honeymoon with her.. ..go and get him. Brother Pappu. His name is not Pappu. He's Govardhan. He's not Govardhan. He's Mangu. Then on whom do I vent our anger? How do I know? Don't ask me. Dolly. Dolly. Thank God, I found you. Brother Diesel is looking out for me.. ..thinking that I'm your boyfriend. Calm down. He won't hurt you. Dolly, should I tell you something if you don't mind? Go on. It's better to spend an entire lifetime.. ..in someone's true love instead of living on false hope. Sir is not that true love. Brother Diesel is your true love. He's madly in love with you. Give him a chance if possible. You know, he loves you so much. You're a good boy, Govardhan. Brother Pappu. God! It's okay. I do get angry. Not again, Diesel. No, listen. Diesel! Help! I didn't do anything. Listen to me, Diesel. Dolly.. There's nothing going on between me and Dolly. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Diesel! There's nothing going on between me and Dolly. You.. Diesel, trust me. There's nothing going on between me and Dolly. Don't hit me. Diesel. There's nothing. Diesel, stop it. There's nothing. I left you because of this anger of yours. No, Dolly. You left me because of him. Stop it! - No. I'm coming to you because of him. Yes. - Govardhan isn't my boyfriend. Yes. - He made me realize.. ..how much you love me. Yes. - Dolly. Is he dead? Forgive me. It's not Pappu, but Govardhan. - Govardhan, forgive me. Only on one condition. You will separate from Dolly. Promise! - I promise! Come, Dolly. Let's go. Mummy. I love you mummy. Mummy, I am coming to you. Go away. I won't talk to you. You got married without informing me. And had a honeymoon as well. Mother, do you think I'll marry someone.. ..without your approval and without informing you? Mother, I'll marry the girl of your choice. If you ask me to marry her, I'll marry her. Mummy. - Okay, then. I say, marry her. - Mummy. She will be my daughter-in-law. Tell me, do you agree? Mummy, have I ever said no to you? Give a hug. Stupid. Hug me, not her. Mummy, I've been hugging you since childhood. Let me hug her today. Shameless. Mala.. Come on and get me. Stop it. It's a hospital. Sorry. That's right. Even I like dancing, girls. - Yeah. Just a minute. Just a minute. Hello. - Hello, Nunnu. Who Nunnu? This is John Mathews. Oh, shut up. I recognize your voice very well. Where are you? Did you get any proof? Proof? What proof? Which proof? Where are you right now? I'm at the Heritage Hotel. What? I'm there too. You do one thing. You quickly come to the shopping arcade. You want to meet me, too? Cool. - Okay. But how will I recognise you? Oh come on, Nunnu. What happens to you? Are you having the same problem you had in college? Nunnu. I'll recognise you. I'm waiting at the shopping arcade. Come quickly. Right now. Okay? Okay? - Alright. See you in a bit. Come on, girls. I don't have much time left. - Yeah. Come on, quickly. You should've been in Pune with your mother. What are you doing here? Raj. - Yes, Raj. Your husband Raj. The husband you are suspecting today. That he has an affair with someone. If he is, then let him. I mean go on. Go and check each and every nook and corner of this place.. ..check each room if you find another woman. You doubt me when I cannot live without you. No actually, Raj, I.. - What I? This is what has made us selfish. It's always this car is mine. This bungalow is mine. This business is mine. I am the sole owner of Saxena Group of Industries. And you are an employee.. - But.. An employee who day and night.. ..attends meetings for you is being cheated. Madam, you? Mangu, you? What are you doing here? It's all thanks to sir. Sir, you are downstairs and upstairs.. The upstairs business isn't conducted downstairs, Mangu. No. I was just asking whether the business meeting.. ..that was going on got over or not? Did you hear that? I'm attending meetings on New Year's day and you.. ..you're suspecting me. - Sorry. I've never seen a man like him. He attends meetings day and night. You forget all this. Take this. - Thanks. Celebrate New Year. Happy New Year, sir. - Happy New Year. Happy New Year, ma'am. - Happy. I'll keep meeting you. Thank you, Mangu. Bye. Forgive me. I made a mistake. I'll never do it again. Please. Sir! It's me. - Are you still angry with me? Sir me, John Mathews. - I promise. I will always trust you. Why are you ignoring me? - Sir! Sir, you said that I got married. I'm not married, sir. I'm a bachelor. I'm single and young, sir. Let go of me, Raj. What are you doing? Come let's go home. - Sir! - Let's go home? Thank you for the party, sir. What, man? We're tired of looking for John Mathews. - I'm John Mathews. I am.. - Mathews! I'm John Mathews! John! John! John! We found John! John Mathews! John? John Mathews? - Yes. John Mathews. We found John Mathews. Where were you? I've been looking for you all through the hotel. Come on. Everyone is waiting for you there. Come on. Let's take him along. - Hey, where are you taking him? Let's go. Let's go. Sir. Sir. Sir. We found him. We found John Mathews, sir. Hey.. He's..my papa? Grandpa. Grandpa. Papa's papa? - Yes. He's John Mathews? - He as well? How's that possible? Then who's he? Grandpa, for an inheritance of Rs.5 billion.. ..let alone John Mathews' duplicate.. ..they can make a duplicate of Ambani as well. No, Grandpa, I am the original John Mathews. I am John Mathews. It's possible that he's a duplicate. What are you saying, Grandpa? Just a minute. Do you remember when I was a child.. ..I had a mole on my left waist where you used to tickle me? Look at this. Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. Yes. Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. Here. Same to same? Just a minute. Just a minute. Yes. Do you remember when I was1 8 years old.. ..I'd got a tattoo and you got very angry? Do you remember? Look at this. Look at this, Grandpa. It's the same tattoo. On the back. He has a tattoo on his back as well. Okay, Grandpa. Only the Mathews family has the copyright.. ..of the proof I'll show you now. Oh. Let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You too have seven? But he has only five of them. At least you tell me who am I if not John Mathews. I don't know who you are. But you're not John. You're not John Mathews. You're not John. You're not John Mathews. You don't have to feel bad about it. I just asked for my name. Who am I? Breaking all the lock and key. Leaving everything aside. Breaking all the lock and key. Leaving everything aside. I've come to meet you. Your beloved has come to meet you. Breaking all the lock and key. Leaving everything aside. Breaking all the lock and key. Leaving everything aside. I've come to meet you. Your beloved has come to meet you. Mangu. Mangu wants mangu. Kiran! I'm coming! K..Kiran! I think his memory's back. Oh God! Raj, you're doomed. Kiran, I've come. I've brought the proof. Nunnu has done it. I'm so happy, Kiran. I'm so happy. In a few moments there will be you, me, this house and these cars. The one who won't be here is your fraud husband. What is this, Raj? Kiran threw you out even before I showed the photographs? Hurry up, Kiran. Otherwise, we'll miss the flight. I don't want to miss my second honeymoon at any cost. Kiran! Kiran! Baby! Baby! Baby! I'm so happy. You've made me very happy today. I love you. I love you. I love you. Let's go. I love you. Love you. That's great, Raj. Nice big house, nice wife, nice big cars. That's great. Ouch. - Ouch? What happened? But.. - Let's go. Let's go enjoy ourselves. Let's enjoy. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. 'I wish this camera would've fallen a second later.' 'Or Kiran and I would've left a second earlier.' 'But that didn't happen.' K..Kiran! Kiran! K..Kiran! K.. Kiran! K.. Kiran! My dear.. K.. Kiran! Kiran! Kiran! Kiran! Bebo! What a Bebo! Bebo! What a Bebo! I met her here. I met her here and there. How did I meet her? Where did I meet her? I met her here. I met her here and there. Bebo! Bebo! Bebo! I met her here. I met her here and there. How did I meet her? Where did I meet her? I met her here. I met her here and there. Bebo! Bebo! Bebo! Let it be. Let the fragrance of love spread. I lost my heart when I saw you. Yes, you've got the look. You're my beloved. Where are you going? Hold on. You've got the look. Got the look. Yes, you've got the look. Yes, you've got the look. You're my beloved. Where are you going? Hold on. You've got the look. Got the look. Yes, you've got the look. She resides in my dreams. She's a little crazy. She's still unaware of my restless heart. He doesn't listen to me. He's crazy. I fear this might create a saga. Let it be. Don't stop me. Let me go away. I lost my heart when I saw you. Yes, you've got the look. You're my beloved. Where are you going? Hold on. You've got the look. Got the look. Yes, you've got the look. Bari Barsi had gone out, he brought back Bebo. Bari Barsi had gone out, he brought back Bebo.
