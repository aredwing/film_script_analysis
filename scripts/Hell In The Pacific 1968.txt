You will be dead soon! No. Look, all I want is some water. You got plenty there. Enough for everybody. You know, they got rescue boats out looking for me... and if I tell them that you wouldn't give me any water... Boy, they're sure gonna give it to you. I mean... Come on. Just some water? Damn it! Come on out, Yankee! Come on and get it! Damn it! Come and get it! Come on and get it. You'll be sorry! Quiet! Shut up! I said shut up! Just a closer walk with thee Nearer my God All clear to thee When I fail, I feel so bad Sir. Now hear this! "Watchman... "what of the night?" I am real strong, but thou art weak Damn it, dirty. Damn it. Dirty. Yes! Okay. Yes. Yeah. Come on. Oh, my God. Get up! Stand up! Stand! Stand up! Under the name of the Imperial Japanese Navy... I demand absolute obedience as a prisoner of war. You understand? Don't look! Don't look over here. I said don't look! I will tear your eyeballs out! I said don't look! Win a few, lose a few. Keep going. I have this. Tweet-tweet. Let's see now. "The Gourmet's Guide." "The wild form of the water chestnuts. "It is often found..." "Reference, Figure 33." Well, that's enough of that, all right. "Enemy personnel and unfriendly natives. "A man fighting for survival in a jungle... "is in no position to maintain prisoners of war. "Destroy them if they are captured. Immediately." Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Okay. Don't you understand? I throw, you go. Right? Fetch. You get the point? You're the dog, I'm the guy. Right? Look. You ready? Right? Fetch! Look, you do it this time. I'm tired. Okay, I'll show you one more time. And never again, right? You understand that? What is he doing? Fool. Then you pick up the stick, right? Then you bring it back. There's nothing tough about that. What's so tough about that? You gonna do it, or ain't you gonna do it? I don't know. Some guys never learn. I don't know. You know, it's just ridiculous. Okay, we'll try it once more. One, two, three. You go, right? I know. Okay, look. Right? You understand what I'm talking about? I am sick and tired! I've done everything! I feed you. I fish for you! I take you to the head, and what do you do? You just sit down and get fatter! I'm not putting up with any of that anymore! So from now on out, you can do the cooking, 'cause I am through! Oh, boy. Well, do something! Hey! Damn it! What are you trying to do? Give it back! Fifty-fifty, right? I said give it back. Why don't you go and get some for yourself? You damn thief! That is my log! It's my log. Not yours. Mine! It's my log. That is my log! Look, if I told you once, I told you a thousand times! That is my log. Now keep your hands off it! You want my log, you can have it! I said you can have it! Look, you can do anything you want to do around here. But just don't be sneaky about it. 'Cause I can't stand a sneak! You wanna build a raft, build a raft! A raft. You call that thing a raft? It's a piece of junk! Now, you wanna build a raft... you gotta talk to somebody who knows how to do it. You wanna build a raft? Look. "Sailing, sailing over the bounding main." Raft. Wait a minute. I'll be right back. Okay. Yeah. This is a map of the Pacific Ocean. Do you wanna build a raft? A raft. And you're in it, so that's... This is you in a raft. And you wanna go... Now, you gotta have some floatation, like bamboo. Where did you get all your bamboo? Well, where do you find it? Throw them high, old man. We have to have a lubber line. It goes straight through the keel. Otherwise, the ship goes either way. Nobody knows... No! I said no! You're not listening to me. But we gotta do it. Use these bamboos here. Come on, come over here! All right, take these bamboos and select only the big ones... and put them together in bundles. Then make the basic frames with them. The frames. No, you're not listening. And we put this mast... You have to have a couple of sweeps down the side, and a tail. Otherwise... ...around the one-third of the raft's length from the aft. That is the basic plan. You gotta have something strong enough to get through the reef! I'm telling you. If you keep talking like an amateur, we'll never make it! I can't talk any sense to that guy. This is our island. In our north-east-north... there must be a big island. North-east-north. If we go north-east-north riding a good tide... we should find a big island. Let's get out of here as soon as we can. Let's do it. What do you want me to do? If we stay here, both of us will be dead for sure. How many times do I have to tell you? You might as well dry up on this island and drop dead! Not me. I'm not going to die. No, not me! Now wait, don't get mad. Okay. All right. All right, we build a raft. Down in the canebrake, close by the mill There lived a colored girl And her name was Nancy Dill I told her that I loved her I loved her mighty fine And if she would come with me I soon would make her mine Come along, come Won't you come along with me? And I'll take you down to Tennessee Come along, come Won't you come along with me? And I'll take you down to Tennessee The mast! Hold this with your other hand! Down in the canebrake, close by the mill There lived a colored girl And her name was Nancy Dill I told her that I loved her I loved her mighty fine And if she would come with me I soon would make her mine Come along, come Won't you come along with me? And I'll take you down to Tennessee Come along, come Won't you come along with me? And I'll take you down to Tennessee Island! Hey, island! Hey, is anybody there? Anybody home? Hello! Are there any Japanese? It's Japanese. Any Japanese troops here? Pipe down! Be quiet, that's a Japanese camp. Any Japanese troops here? I am a navy captain, Kuroda! Any Japanese troops here? Navy Captain Tsuruhiko Kuroda! Isn't there anybody here? No! Don't shoot! He's my friend! Hold your fire! Don't shoot! What's the password? We don't know the password! Don't shoot! Hold your fire! We surrender! No! For a second, I thought you were a Jap. Oh, yes. Jesus. Hey, white beard! Come up here. I found food. I got sake, too. Look, I got some cigarettes, and some malted milk tablets... and a lot of other junk, too. White beard, let's have a shave. Then you are indeed the true Kuroda Samurai What's the matter? My log! Look, never talk to anybody that close in the face. It's rude. You might have bad breath or something. Yeah, I'll let you go home. Where was I? Oh, yeah. And there he is, the Zero. Then I get all laced up. I'm smoking and burning. I'm going down. So now I know I gotta ditch the thing, see, in the water? Forget it, all right? When you hit the water like that, you flip and it's over. It worked out okay. So, boom, down I go. The canopy's open, of course, and so then I bail out... and that's when I pull the life raft and... Thank you very much. How about you sing a song or something? It didn't make any difference, anyway. My crew was already dead. What's the matter? Sing. Okay, I will do it, then. When I go on sea I will become a corpse in water When I go on hills I will become a corpse with moss If my spirit can be near the Emperor I would not be regretful about myself I'm sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to... All right, don't worry. We have plenty of sake. Here, have some more. Thank you. You know, I was thinking... Suppose I ask you... Well, I guess it doesn't make much difference anyway. Yeah. Yeah. You know, they told me... You know, how come you guys don't believe in God? You listening? No God? Why don't you... God! Will you listen to me? God. Why don't you? I'm talking to you. G-O-D, God! Heaven? Christ? Jesus Christ! Shut up. What? Shut up! I said God. You'd better watch how you talk to me. Be quiet! Be quiet! You son of a bitch! You rotten bastard!
