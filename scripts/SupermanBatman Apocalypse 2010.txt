Instead, I wanna switch gears... ...to Gotham's new fleet of automated surveillance blimps... ...which took flight earlier this week. Are these unmanned eyes in the sky a black eye on people's privacy? That's what civil liberty groups are saying. What about you? Before we get to your calls, here's headline news. Vicki? A.J., blimps aren't the only sights we've been seeing these last few nights. A rash of meteor showers has lit up the skies from coast to coast this week... ...following the destruction of a giant kryptonite asteroid by our own dark knight. Today, NASA officials, who have been monitoring the situation... ...say we've seen the last of these shooting stars... ...since most of the kryptonite debris has moved beyond Earth's orbit. Meanwhile, there's been no comment from Batman... ...who seems to have gone back into seclusion. This morning in the nation's capital... ...Superman completed his deposition for the impeachment hearings. He hoped the removal of President Luthor... ...would usher in a new era of peace and tranquillity. From what we gather, something has come down near Gotham harbour. Let's take some more callers. It was unbelievable. It lit up my bedroom like the middle of the day. There was this big boom... ...and then the whole apartment just started shaking. I was so scared. Huge fireball. My neighbour said it fell in the bay. Had to be a meteor, right? I mean, what else could it have been? Hey, check it out. Well, hello, beautiful. You getting a little fresh air? Whoa, whoa. Slow down, honey. What is that, Swedish? Hey, Gus, I think she likes you. Come on, sweetheart. Let old Gus give you a private lesson in foreign relations. Hey, lady. Gus may be a jerk, but you shouldn't have... Lady, I didn't have nothing to do with them. Here, take it. It's all I got. I swear. Hey, man, you okay? Tell me what happened. Lady, are you all right? Bring her down. Enough. I don't know who you are, but you've had enough fun for one night. Her DNA is definitely not human. Enhance. Extremely high concentrations of neural stem cells. Her name is Kara Zor-El, from Krypton. She's my cousin. Your cousin just torched $50,000 worth of custom hardware. - Send me the bill. - On a reporter's salary, right. "This vessel contains my daughter, Kara Zor-El... ...from the now dead planet Krypton. Treat her as you would your own child. She will prove a treasure for your world." Treasure. You're sure of the translation? It says treasure. Not terror, not trouble. Always the cynic. You can't help yourself, can you? You know those tests I was running? Her cellular structure is a shade more dense than yours. She metabolizes sunlight more efficiently. It could be her youth. It could be something else. Bottom line, she might be more powerful than you. It makes me wonder. So does her sudden appearance. I find it just a little too... - Speak English. - It's attacking. What's attacking? That. Krypto. No. Bad dog. Kara's a friend. Leave her alone. I'm sorry, l... I've tried to get him to like me, but he just barks and growls, he hates me. Go up to your quarters. But I didn't do anything wrong. We'll talk later. Krypto's just feeling a little overprotective. Aren't you, boy? I don't know. I've always considered him a good judge of character. Look, she's been through a lot. Not to mention learning an entire language in less than a week. - Why don't you cut her some slack? - We don't know anything about her. She claims to have no memory of anything prior to splashing down in Gotham Bay. I'm not saying there aren't loose ends. Having no control over her powers is more than a loose end. She's dangerous. Which is why she's in quarantine until she can gain control. She may be the only blood relative I have left. I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, at least for the time being. You don't have a problem with that, do you? No problem at all. But I can't speak for the dog. Spying on me now? You don't like me, do you? Huh. It's you that has the problem. Why can't you leave me alone? You'll never understand what it's like to be me. Then explain it to me until I do. Does any of this help fill in your memory lapses? Some. I know that's my Uncle Jor-El and my Aunt Lara. Because Superman, Kal-El, told you. No. Because I remember. Uncle Jor-El was like my father. They both believed the planet was doomed... ...which is why my father also built a ship. He told me the navigation system was locked onto Earth... ...and that he and my mother would soon follow. I was just about out when... I saw them die, right before my eyes. And then there was that light, that awful, blistering light. Then, all I remember is darkness. The rest you told me. How the asteroid carried me across the galaxy... ...until it broke and I landed here. Do you remember your mother's name? You know I don't. Why don't you trust me? Kal-El has enemies who would go to great lengths to destroy him. You think I would hurt my own cousin? Perhaps not intentionally. I sensed your presence earlier because I thought I heard your heartbeat. I was wrong. You have no heart. My Treasure, you are one of the finest warriors on Apocalypse. But do you really think you have what it takes to be captain of the honour guard... ...to the almighty Darkseid? Bring them forth so they can taste my blade. Furies. This one was no match for us. Let the dogs clean up the mess. You disappoint me, Granny Goodness. You led me to believe Treasure could replace Big Barda as captain of my guard. She showed such promise. There has been an interesting development on Earth. Bring me the girl who fell out of the sky. The one they call Kara. And this time don't fail me. Or it will be you, dear Granny, whom the Furies carve up next. I'm so glad to be out of quarantine, I can't tell you. Don't get me wrong, I like the Fortress of Solitude. But you have to admit, it is a little boring. Metropolis is much more my style. This is the life I want, Kal. Uh... I mean, Clark. You've got plenty of time to decide. I wanna know everything there is to know about being an Earth girl. Where do we start? I have a pretty good idea. Come on. Whoa! Ready? Ta-da! Well? Uh, no way. Perfect. I'll take it. Oops. Heh-heh-heh. Oh, my gosh. That was so much fun. I'm going to love being an Earth girl. You've certainly got the shopping part down. Are you hungry? I'm starving. - They're not really made out of...? - No. That's so good. Well, that's it. Shopping, junk food... I'd say you're a bona-fide Earth girl. It's so beautiful here. Not like that other city where Grumpy Ass lives. Grumpy Ass isn't so bad once you get to know him. What's his problem anyway? He just wants you to take things a little slower. Adapting to a new culture, any culture, can be difficult. Is that why you wear those eyeglasses, as a way of adapting... ...even though you can see better than anyone? It's a way for those of us who are heroes to have lives without the cape. It's important to keep our identities a secret. That's why Mr. Friendly never takes off his lead-lined cowl. You noticed the lead. I didn't know your x-ray vision had kicked in. You didn't ask. Oh, my. This is how they see you. Bigger than life. You're their champion. These powers. - Do you ever regret having them? - No. Not even a little? Can I tell you something? You can tell me anything. They terrify me. I mean, the responsibility. I don't wanna be anybody's champion. - No offence. - None taken. - What is it? - Stay close. - Guess it was... Uh! - Kal. Help me. Someone, anyone. Kara. We were told you would try to stop us, but we're taking the girl. She's not going anywhere. It may not seem like it now... ...but this is for your own good. You. I'm sorry, but it has to be this way. She's right. I don't understand. Look around. What if this had been the middle of the day? The park crowded with people, children. She needs more specialized training. I'm taking her with me. And what if I say no? There's another reason she can't stay. I'll explain later. For now, I'm asking you to trust me. Kal, you're not gonna let her take me away, are you? I'll work at controlling my powers. I promise. Kal. Kal. Lyla, hurry. Kara is going up against Artemis. Be right there. Ready when you are, Artemis. Ready. Go. What's the point of this? Kara could level the entire island. Having power and knowing how to use it aren't the same thing. You of all people should know that. She's getting on my nerves. I heard that too. Now, little one, prepare... Uh! Don't touch her. Kal, it's a training exercise. She wasn't going to hurt me. Is there a problem? You asked me to keep an open mind? Well, I've kept an open mind. But Kara belongs in Metropolis with me. We agreed this was in her best interest. Wait a minute, don't I have a say? - No. - No. I'm sorry, of course you do. But you've been hidden away on Paradise Island for two months now. You don't know what the rest of the world has to offer. Who else is suited to decide what's right for you? How about me? You let them bring me here... ...and now because you have a problem with it, you want me to return? I'm tired of being jerked around, treated like a child. From now on, I'll decide what's best for me. Come on, Lyla. Let's go before someone tries sending me to bed without dinner. Don't ever do that again. You looked like you were ready to snap Artemis' neck. Harbinger's visions show Kara in danger. How do you expect me to react with a sword to her throat? I expect you to be rational. - Bruce. - No. Ever since this girl came into our lives, you've let your guard down. Even exposed your secret identity despite common sense. Unlike you, Bruce, I don't look for the bad in everyone. You may think I'm naive... ...but my every instinct tells me this girl is my cousin. She's done nothing to show me otherwise and she'll be safe with me. Clark, the visions are getting worse. I know Kal is only trying to protect me, but he's making me crazy. And everyone pretending to know what's best for me. Agh! I thought I knew what I wanted, but now... ...I feel more lost than ever. Kara, when I first came here, I was confused too. Able to see into the past, the future... ...yet not having a clue what to do with my own life. A harbinger for everyone but myself. Diana took me in without hesitation. If you need someone to turn to, you can trust her. You've all made me feel so welcome. Especially you, Lyla. I feel like you're the only friend I have right now. - Kara. - What is it? Nothing. I'm just glad we're friends. Hey, how about a swim? I could use a little cooling off. Maybe we should get back. Kal will be worried about you. Come on, one little swim. You're not afraid of the water, are you? Are you telling me these visions are about to become a reality? - Lyla believes so. - But she hasn't given us a lot to go on. Which is why it's just as well we keep Kara in the dark. So we just keep waiting? This is the safest place for her, Clark. I've had my army standing by. I can call them up anytime. Now might be good. Doomsday. Protect Kara, I'll handle this. Wait, the tube. It isn't closing. Darkseid. He's replicated the monster. Then we draw a line in the sand and hold them here. Batman. Well? Did you come here to sightsee or fight? Amazons, attack. There's no blood. Something's not right. Wait a minute. Diana, pull your army back. - What? - Do it. Amazons, fall back. This ends now. I had no choice. They weren't truly alive. No blood, no minds. You did what you had to do. Where's Batman? The Doomsday attack was a diversion. A second tube opened here. There were four, maybe five. She didn't go down without a fight. Kara. Lyla. She died trying to protect Kara. I swear that her death will be avenged. I'm going to Apocalypse. That's exactly what Darkseid wants. Then I won't disappoint him. You mean we won't disappoint him. Let me go, you witch. Let me... Shut up. See? Granny has your room all ready. Don't worry, baby girl, you won't be alone for long. Enjoy the accommodations. You may feel powerless now... ...but soon you will watch the fear in men's eyes. As captain of my Furies your fame will spread throughout the universe. You will see the fiercest warriors flee your presence. Armies brought to their knees. Entire nations crumble at the mere mention of your name. You will know power you would've never known on Earth. Never again will you be lost. From now on you will be at my side. Forever mine, forever Darkseid's. Over here, come on. Over here, I'm open. When I said drop in anytime, this isn't quite what I pictured. Hello, Barda. Diana. You didn't leave, like, an invisible plane in the driveway, right? We need to talk. Can I get dressed first? You were captain of Darkseid's honour guard. I defected. Was it easy? No. But for the first time, I'm free. And this... This nice, quiet, boring little life... ...it's all mine. We need your help, Barda. Darkseid has kidnapped my cousin, Kara. Then she is lost to you. I'm sorry. Barda, you can't just... Listen to me, it's too late. Darkseid will control her mind. Mould her into a killing machine. Exploit her weaknesses. Just like he did me. Barda. We know you were made to do terrible things. No one blames you. Now he's got Kara, my cousin. We're going to Apocalypse. We need your help to get there. You have no idea what you're up against. All we ask is to borrow your Mother Box... ...so we can generate a boom tube to get there. It sounds as if you think you're coming back. We'll get back. There are no exits from that inferno, Superman. The entire planet is a death-trap. It was a mistake to come. If Barda refuses to help, how are we...? I'll help you get to Apocalypse. On one condition. I'm going with you. - Barda. - No way. I know Darkseid's fortress like the back of my hand. You need me, so get over it. I'm over it. What about you two? No place like home. Smells like death. You think Darkseid knows we're here? He knows. Well, I guess that warmed us up. We've gone over the layout of Darkseid's fortress. We all know our jobs. Stay sharp. Good luck. I guess we'll take the low road. After you. This might not be the right time, but you've always been an inspiration to me. - Barda. - Seriously, Diana. When someone brings hope to another person, it's a gift. And growing up in this hell-hole... Where you grew up, Barda, is where you will die. Well, well, the gang's all here. You should never have come back, Barda. Although, personally, I look forward to watching you die. I'd tell you to go to hell, Gillotina... ...but given the situation, that'd be redundant. They'll go for position, try to separate us. Let them try. Furies, destroy them. - Damn. - Bring the intruder's head to Darkseid. Glory to the one who takes the life of the Kryptonian. Hail Darkseid. - They're very good. - They should be, I trained them. Great. Okay, boys, chew on this. Bingo. Hell-spores. Enough power here to blow a hole straight to the planet's core. Darkseid. Kill them. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Diana. Nice try. Let's see you smile now. Surrender, Amazon. - Barda. - Surrender now, or the bitch dies. No, Diana, let them kill me. Never surrender. Imagine how pleased Darkseid will be. Why settle for some girl who fell to Earth... ...when I can deliver to him the champion of the Amazons. Darkseid. Kara leaves with me. She's free to leave, if that is what she desires. Kara? Hello, Kal. - Kara. - I'm fine, Kal, really. I don't know what he's done to you, but the nightmare's over. You're safe now. You're right, she is safe now. Let's go home. That's the problem, cousin. I'm not sure where home is. You're just confused. I'll be back. You and I have unfinished... You didn't listen to what Darkseid said. - Kara. - You never listen to anyone. He said I was free to go, if I wanted to. And I don't want to. Good. Now kill him. I won't fight you. Good. Makes my job that much easier. What's wrong with the beast? Must be something he ate. Take off your armour. Now. Let me kill her, Granny. No, it's me you want. Let her go. I like to have my cake and eat it too. Make her bleed. You were saying, Granny? Go ahead. Kill me. - That's what you're programmed to do. - Barda. What's the matter, Barda? You know you want to. All these years of pretending to be human have made you soft. Kara, he's controlling you. Fight it. Do not hesitate. Kill him. As you wish, Lord Darkseid. With your death, cousin, my life begins here on Apocalypse. Not if I can help it. Darkseid said you wouldn't be up to the challenge. That your feelings, your beliefs, would cloud your judgement. He's right, you know. Earth does need a new hero. Not his version. You think killing me will set you free? He's just using you. Liar. He cares about me. No, Kara, I care about you. But you won't listen. His control over you is total. I see that now, which is why I have to do this. It's over, Darkseid. Even you must realize the folly of being a king without a kingdom. I doubt the battle between the Kryptonians will bring about such destruction. I'm not talking about them. Your armoury, the hell-spores, they've been activated. Impossible. The arming code is encrypted. I broke the code and reprogrammed them. You're bluffing. Omega lambda 7- X-L-9. That sound like a bluff to you? One hell-spore can turn an entire planet into a fire pit. What will happen to Apocalypse when 500 go off simultaneously? You dare? You dare? I could destroy you with a single blast of my omega beams. You could. But that wouldn't stop the hell-spores, would it? You will disarm them. Here's the deal. Release the girl and give your word you'll leave her alone. Forswear Kara Zor-El. Say it. Well played. Had the Kryptonian or the Amazon taken that gamble, they would have lost. They do not have the strength of character... ...to destroy an entire planet to achieve success. But you, a human? You kill your own kind to win battles. An admirable quality. Take the girl. I will make no move against her. I'll hold you to that. We'll all hold you to it. Mercy, Barda? Disappointing. Disarm the hell-spores. Leave Apocalypse. Hey. Am I dreaming? What happened? I don't remember anything after... Lyla. You're safe now. It's nothing. Just a scratch. I remember dreaming, a horrible nightmare. All I wanted to do was get home. I did terrible things. Darkseid lives for manipulation. He has hypnotists, scientists and sadists... ...whose only functions are to break your spirit. Darkseid is evil. But did he influence me? Or just bring out a darkness that is already there? You're here with me. And you're okay. Nothing else matters. You said to me once you didn't wanna be anybody's champion. When you're strong, there's somewhere I want to take you. Where you can be safe. Where you can fit in. Where you can just be yourself. You're sure it's a good idea? It feels right. - Can't let it rest, can you? - Knock it off, you two. Lyla. I'm going to miss you more than you can even imagine. You were my first friend and you accepted me without question. Maybe because as Harbinger you saw something in me that's worthwhile. Now, all I have to do is find that thing. I'll try not to disappoint you. Diana, I can't thank you enough. You will always have a home here. Alura. You once asked if I could remember my mother's name. It was Alura. Kal, I'm ready now. - Thank you. - You still owe me a computer. Might take a while. Reporter's salary. Always has to have the last word. Welcome to Smallville. This is where you grew up? It's not so bad. No, I didn't mean... It's just so different compared to Krypton. Even Metropolis. I think I'm going to like it here. It can be a little quiet. Kal, I've been chased, shot at, kidnapped... ...beaten up, had my mind controlled and I broke a nail. I'm ready for a little quiet. If I know my mother, she'll have some of her famous apple pie waiting. You okay? Little nervous, I guess. It's just, you have this life. You can be Clark, or Kal-El, or Superman. Even a son. Who am I going to be? I can't answer that, Kara, only you can. Whatever you decide, I'll be there for you. I promise. Now, come on. Let's go meet the folks. I gave my word I would not come for the girl. Your death, however, is long overdue, Superman. Kal. Uh! Kara, no! Stupid girl. You murdering... Time to die, Man of Steel. Darkseid. There's more where that came from. Fearless. Untapped power. It would have been a glorious life for you, captain of my honour guard. Instead, my omega beams will reduce you to ashes. Take your best shot. Impressive. Under my guidance, you could have become the most powerful being in the universe. Your life here will be nothing in comparison. But it'll be my life. We will meet again, Kryptonian. You didn't think you could just walk away, did you? Don't ever come here again, or you won't be going back. That should give him something to think about back on Apocalypse. Apocalypse? I'm not so sure. While you were busy... ...I took the liberty of reconfiguring the boom tube's coordinates. Something Darkseid taught me... ...that I'm guessing he's probably regretting about now. I don't think he'll be a problem again. Not until someone thaws him out anyway. Kal, there was a moment there when I thought you were dead. And I realized, ever since I arrived... ...I've been running away from who I am and what I'm meant to be. I've made a decision, Kal. I know what I want to do. Uh-oh. Mom, Dad, this is Kara. My cousin? Your niece? Mr. Kent, Mrs. Kent. It's so nice to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you both. Don't worry, I can build you a new one. I can help. I'm great with a hammer. I can pound. I'm a good pounder. I know how busy you all are... ...but it's only appropriate that you should be the first to hear. You, who would put your lives on the line for a perfect stranger. We're all alike, for each of us, in our own way... ...had to struggle to become who we are. But what better role for anyone to aspire to, than hero? So allow me to reintroduce my cousin, Kara Zor-El. Or as the world will come to know her, Supergirl. To be honest, I'm not sure I've earned the right to wear this uniform. But I will. Hey.
