Cheekbone and nasal bone are shattered. Chipping to the left cranial bone. You were a singer? Where was that? - Most recently at the St Michaels choir. - In London? - Yes. - When? Up to '38. Then you, a Jewess, returned here. Why? They have wonderfully cool cellars. And there's a real plantation in the park. We'll soon be able to walk around. - And you'll be able to... - Who's paying for this, Lene? - You? - No. You inherited. Your entire family is dead. And Herbert and Marie... - the twins... - Esther? I haven't found her yet. Where is Johnny? So how do you want to look? It's your choice. Some of my patients favour Zarah Leander, others Miss Sderbaum. I guess they're both out of fashion now. A few gentlemen out there would probably like new faces, too. I want to look like I used to. That's difficult. I recommend you think it over. Why? On the one hand, it's never quite the same, and on the other, a new face is an advantage. - How is it an advantage? - You'll be a new and different person. You won't be identifiable, which means... I want to look exactly like I used to. You'll receive an intravenous anaesthetic. An ether mask can't be used due to your face's condition, but don't be concerned, you'll sleep deeply. Just count backwards: Ten... nine, eight, etc. Know what the Americans call it? A "countdown". It comes from a German film, "Woman in the Moon". So now count, ten... - Ten. - Nine... - Nine. - Carry on. Eight, seven... six, five... JEW. JEW. JEW... JOHANNES LENZ, PIANIST, DIVORCED OCTOBER, 04,1944 That's already looking really good. A couple of days and the bandages come off. I found an apartment, by the way. In Haifa. You can see the sea. Beautiful, simple-lined architecture. Bernstein designed it. I've got photos. Want a look? Here. No, I didn't see him. Nelly, it was bombed out. It no longer exists. I no longer exist. Nelly, remember how you felt three months ago? How desperate you were? It's extraordinary what Dr Bongartz... - In a few days the bandages come off... - Would you recognise me? Would you recognise me? Yes. No. This is me. Where did you get that? The clinic needed pictures for the reconstruction. Sorry, that's the wrong word. Dr Bongartz used it and I simply... - Re-creation is better, right? - Re-creation. Just look at me. Nelly, you're beautiful. That's not the point. What do the circles signify? Those are Nazis. And the crosses are for the dead? Yes. We need a cross above Esther, too. It's such a miracle you survived. There's no cross above Johnny. Johnny doesn't interest me. Here are dresses, a jacket of English cloth, and there are two coats, a summer one and a lined one, to get you started. It was all acquired by Mrs Winter. Wonderful cloth. You're a size 38, right? And when are you going to Palestine? I don't know yet. So, this is the bathroom, all fully equipped, and in perfect working order. If you need anything, please let me know. No, that we won't do. The light stays off. We have a real plague of flies. The war didn't seem to bother them at all. They come up from the lake in swarms. No, please don't, I'd rather do it myself. - When do we dine, Elisabeth? - At seven, if it please you, Ma'am. - What have you cooked for us? - Stuffed cabbage with sweetbread. Where did the sweetbread come from? I have no nutmeg, no butter, no black pepper, it's awful. But you improvise so wonderfully. Improvise, improvise! I've had it with improvising. Elisabeth is really a gem. - She's not a Nazi? - She always hated the Nazis. So, you like it? Yes. Great. By the way, I put the papers for the Haifa apartment on the desk. And I found two other for us in Tel Aviv. One is on a housing project. We're being allocated terrain. You know, it wasn't easy getting us both a visa. - So, there. - Thank you, Elisabeth. Can you manage? Yes. Can I hear that again? It's nice, huh? I'd listened to it in London before falling asleep. Would you sing it for me? Okay. I can't stand German songs anymore. When you're better, we'll take care of your assets. Is it a lot? They're substantial. It'll take a while... to get the Nazis out of the properties, but there's lots of money in Switzerland. It's the victims' money, it brings an obligation. To do what? To go to Palestine and found a state where we Jews can live safely. To do so, we take back all they took away. Maybe then we can sing and hear German songs again. Did you like it? Yes. Then give me something. Yes. I'm looking for my husband. He's a musician, too. What does he play? He's a pianist. If he's lucky, he'll be in one of the cabarets or clubs. If not, he'll be on the corner with an accordion. What clubs? I'd try the American sector. Johnny, what did I do? I just wanted to dance a bit. Let go of me! Johnny! Get off me! Yes. Excuse me. I mistook you for someone. Stay where you are. I told you to stop right there. What do you have in your bag? Show me. The fine coat! I'll never remove that. That's tar. Where was she gallivanting? Would you leave us for a moment, Elisabeth? So, did you meet him? You can't just wander around at night. There are all sorts out. I don't go out without a revolver. I can't always look after you, I have to go to Poland soon. - I might be there a while. - How long? A week, two, maybe longer. Did you give thought to Haifa or Tel Aviv? In Tel Aviv there's a Jewish choir run by Vera Stroux. - It might suit you. - What would I do in a Jewish choir? - I'm not a Jew. - You are, like it or not. They tried to kill you because you're a Jew. We can't remain here, Nelly. Johnny betrayed you. You were arrested on October 6, 1944. Johnny was arrested on October 4, 1944. He was interrogated and released just after your arrest on October 6. He wasn't put in prison. No punishment. Indeed... he was allowed to play again... now he wants your money. Did you see him? - Yes. - When? Two months ago. Did you speak to him? I don't speak to traitors. Shop window mannequin. Wonderful! Wonderful! We have beer. We have cold beer. We have whisky. We have champagne. And now our delightful Vicky and Lola will sing the one and only Cole Porter's... "Night and Day". Night and day. Night and day I think of you Countless weeks have passed And I just pined for you From the dreams I have at night I awake each morning once again And have your sweet image Before me still Wherever I am, I am with you I often hear your familiar steps Stop at my door And the twinkle of your eyes Lights the dark hours... of my loneliness Vivaciously Night and day, I feel that beloved hand That you softly gave me As we stood by the meadow-side Of my hopes you the mirage That vanishes on my approach - My pining stays unassuaged Night and day Like the rain... Johnny! When the autumn mists fall leaden As the wind, it screeching, cries Clouds, grey and ragged, fly by My heart beats hasty paces Beats and finds no rest at all Like a wailing wind it whispers Just you, you, you Nelly? Everything okay? Yes. One second, I'll be right back. I got you a revolver, too. Know how to use it? Sometimes just showing it is enough. I'm looking for Johnny. Did he gave you those black eyes? He works here. There's no Johnny here. - But I saw him. - I don't know a Johnny. Do you? Johnny, you swine, your pockets are empty But the cellar is full, so really there's plenty The world is a quay all covered with girls The sailors go cross-eyed when they give them a twirl - How about a coffee? - Or two? - Coming up. - Are you Johnny? - The doll here wants work. - But don't hit her again. Johannes, get a move on! He's the one to speak to, Miss. When you're off for a stroll Sunshine doesn't do it To see the town of Berlin Sunshine doesn't do it It's a cosy little spot... It's what you might call a town-and-a-half To make sure you can see it all You really need a couple of hundred watts - But what's this? - And what's this? What kind of town is it? Go switch the light on so we can see... what's there... Switch it on and stop your talking, too... ...so we can see what a sight it is, Berlin by light Go switch the light on so we can see what's there... Go switch the light on so we can see what's there... And what a sight it is... Berlin by light Are you looking for work? Do you have an apartment? All of your own? Wait, Miss. This way, Miss. I don't have much time. We can earn a lot of money. You look very similar to someone. - To whom? - My wife. Alive she was poor, dead, she's rich. What? Why? She and all her family were killed. This way. You can have the backroom. I sleep here. I can't get her inheritance. There's no evidence she's dead. - Maybe she's still alive. - She's dead. You have to play my wife. I'll instruct you. You'll return as a survivor, and collect her estate. We'll split it. There's 20,000 dollars in it for you. But you can't go out over the coming weeks. Nobody may see you. I'll take care of food. - There's an American beer there. - Johnny! Please don't call me that. And... what should I call you? Johannes. You'll call me Johnny in public. - Until then it's Johannes. - Public? Yes, when you return as a survivor. What's your name, anyway? Esther. There aren't many Esthers left. What was your wife's name? Nelly. I'll be back at four. Please let me sleep in. Do I... really look similar to her? No. But you will. Lene? Lene! - Nelly? - Yes. No, don't turn the light on. You saw him. Yes. What happened? It's open. Please go back out. Redo your entrance. Come back in again. Without the bag. Don't look at me, Just come in and walk down the stairs. Just carry on down the stairs. Frankly I hoped you wouldn't come back. - Why? - It won't work. Here are two dollars. And a ration card. I'm sorry. Go on, take it. Now leave. - But we wanted to practise! - It won't work. - Why not? - Because you won't cut it. Now just take... Take the money - and leave. - We could at least try... - Take your bag. - Just for a few days. If it doesn't work, I'll leave. Please. Please. Sit down on the other side. Here's a specimen. You must be able to write like her. Practise it. It's a shopping list. Yes, it's what we'll start with. Now practise. Is that all you own? I'll see what I can organise. Practise. There's some food left over. Thanks. You needn't have bothered. There's no money in the draw. What? Oh, that. - I needed examples. - Of what? Her handwriting. I'd finished the shopping list - and needed more material. - Show me. It's... lying on the table. You didn't trace it? No. 200 G MARGARINE, 4 EGGS, SUGAR, RAISINS, 1 LEMON Sit up. I'll never get used to driving on the left. Write it. Oh, I see... I'll never get used to driving on the left. Write: I am alive and will return soon. Signed, Nelly Lenz. This is her signature. It's almost identical. Good. You can sleep here, we'll continue tomorrow. - Good morning. - Good morning. I brought you some things. Are they... Nelly's things? They were burnt. There are only the shoes. They are from Paris! Try them on. Try the shoes. - Did you buy them for her? - I think so. Do they fit? Did you go to Paris together? - I need to know these things. - Try the other. Walk around in them. Do they pinch? So why are you walking so strangely? We'll need to practise that, too. I only just got up. - I haven't had breakfast. - The water's boiling. We'll eat soon. Now please walk normally. It's too long. Can you sew? - I mean, take it in. - The dress? Her dresses ended just below the knee. Always nice and short, broad and airy. - Can you manage that? - Is that my coffee? Your hair is awful. Something's got to be done about it. Nelly always dyed her hair. - Anything else? - A hell of a lot. We're only starting. If we manage, I mean once we're done here, you'll take a train from the east and we'll meet you at the station. And I'll be... in a red dress and shoes from Paris? You think anyone leaves the camps like that? Nobody will buy it. You've seen the returnees. All the burn wounds and shot-up faces! No one looks at them. Everyone avoids them. But we want them to look at you and say, it's Nelly! Nelly made it! She's back! She's wearing a broad dress and nice shoes because she's so glad. It's this that'll get us what we want. This lot will be meeting you, and these you might meet after arrival. Names and some details. Learn it all by heart. I'll be with you, I'll help. If need be, throw a crying fit. As if you're overwhelmed. Or just hug them, then I'll intervene. We'll practise it. The ones with crosses are dead. Learn about them, anyway. That one was shot in Lichtenberg. He was a Nazi. - This one? - That one. And her, too. Do you... have any photos of Nelly? I'd so much like to see her. Later. Study those ones now. - What colour eyes did Nelly have? - Same as you. - What colour is that? - Blue. Good morning. Good morning. I've found the solution for your hair. It's not my wife, she's an actress. Nelly really liked that picture. The look of her make-up. The hair. She copied it. Particularly for performances. At all performances, in fact. Think you can do it? You know how to apply make-up, right? I've brought you some. And something for your hair. The colour should be right. It won't work, it... I can't come from a camp like that. - I explained that already. - No, that's all... They want Nelly, not a ragged camp-internee. That's what we're working on here. If I'm coming... from a camp, someone is bound to ask me what I experienced there, what I... What? How it was there, - and I'll need a story. - What kind of story? - What? - Something or other. Like... how we sat on a beam, naked and... went through the clothing of those who had just arrived, while the Kapos stood around us. We had to check for banknotes, or jewels they'd hidden, And then this... girl, this girl... looks at me. She looks at me. This girl looks at me... - Where does the story come from? - She's got her mother's dress... - Where from? - I... I read it. Then tell it. If anyone asks. Yes. But I assure you, no one will. None of this lot will ask. Right. No one. You did well. With the dress. - Johnny! - I said don't call me that. Where are you going? - I've got to go out. - I've got to go out, too. Wait. Do you recognise me? Johnny. Enough! Enough! What have you caked your face with? The eye make-up is wrong. Your walk, too. Everything. It's all wrong. Did you at least learn by heart? - I have to go out. - No, no... - I must. - You can't. If you go and someone recognises you, - it was all in vain. - No one will. I have to go out! Please. First the grocer wouldn't sell to us. Then Mr Schmidt-Ott opposite. Nelly was banned from singing. No friends came by anymore. Sigrid and Walter Hochbaum lived on the third floor. They stopped coming, too. I had to hide Nelly in winter '43. Lehmann wouldn't let her in the bomb shelter. We were sure he'd denounced Nelly soon. He envied us our apartment. A friend who died at the front had a houseboat on a nearby lake. That's where I brought her. How did we meet? Put your hat on. People are coming. Come on. - Did you often go walking with her. - Yes. At night? That too, yes. Where would you go to? Did you have favourite places? Of course. What were they? - Let's go. The weather is turning. - So? Shall we go and sit down there? Stop it! Stop it! - What? - Stay away from the photos in my drawer. - Of course. - Then do so! - I didn't look at them. - Quit playing Nelly! I know you're not her! It's not me you must convince! - Where is your hat? - On the bench. - Coming for a beer later on? - Sure. Look! How beautiful to be in love! Here. I'd not have survived the camp except for Johnny. I only thought about how I'd come back to him. And when I finally got here I simply had to look for him. And when I finally found him he didn't recognise me. And it was... Lene, it was... I was... dead again. And... now he's made me back into Nelly again. I can't come to Palestine. Where will you go instead? - With Johnny... back with him. - Impossible. Lene, since being back with him - I'm myself again. - No. - When he speaks of her... - Of her! I'm really jealous... of me! - When will you tell him? - I don't know. Lene, it's as if we were just getting acquainted. For the first time, you hear? And how is this to go on? Soon I arrive by train. He'll inform you about it. Then I'll be here again. - That'll be my return. - Then he'll go after your money. Do you know what disgusts me? We Jews wrote, sang and slaved... went to war for Germany, yet we were gassed, one and all. And now the survivors return and forgive. The gassing ceases and we forgive... all counts of cowardice and treachery. I won't go along with it, Nelly. Lene, I know he loves her. I don't believe he betrayed her. When you were sitting in the dark I thought you'd shot him and needed my help. And honestly, I'd have preferred that. I'll wait for you here. Mrs Lenz! I'm so happy to see you again. Is your husband, too? You know how men are these days. And how are they? Can I offer you something? We have real coffee... for our good guests. Elsie, make us a coffee. Did you know I was hiding down in the boat? No. No. I saw you... at the window... when I was arrested. You and your husband. It was horrific. What could we have done? I said the same to your husband. We were so afraid. - And you know our son... - My... husband was here again? Yes, after your arrest. When? Right away. What are you doing here? It must... have been cold that winter. How was it with the innkeepers? You were right. The landlady didn't ask me about the camps. But she did call me Mrs Lenz. And she cried. You were here the day Nelly was arrested? Says who? The landlady. Let's go. Did you betray Nelly? Sometimes... it's not a real betrayal. You hid her... had to take care of her all that time... Then came arrest and interrogation. Finally you are suddenly released. You hurry to check up on her. You don't notice you're being followed. Then it's too late. You just stand there and there's nothing you can do. You have to watch Nelly being taken away. Get off. Come along. We'll have Nelly return next week. At the station there'll be me, Sigrid, Monika, Frederike, Walther and Alfred. A train will arrive, many people will get off. You'll be sitting to the rear. The train will start to move, then they will see you... in the red dress... and the shoes from Paris. The Nelly of the past. They will be relieved. They'll run towards you. Sigrid will be first. She always is. She'll pretend to be speechless: "I don't believe it." "Nelly!" Then she'll hug you. Alfred, as ever, will say, "Little Nelly." It might almost be, "How you've grown." Monika will tell you about her husband. "I always knew you'd come back." Frederike will complain as usual about her life and Berlin. What about us? We'll walk up to each other. Very tentatively. We won't speak... kiss or fall upon each other. We will simply hug. You'll lay your head on my shoulder and we'll both shut our eyes. We'll do nothing else. Nothing. For ages. REFERENCE. MRS SCHWARZ WAS IN MY EMPLOY FROM MARCH TO SEPTEMBER, 1945. SHE IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER... She left you a letter, too. I am to give it to you. But where is Lene, then? You don't know? Mrs Winter shot herself on Thursday. Dear Nelly, I told you there is no way back for us. But for me there's no way forwards, either. I feel more drawn to our dead than to our living. I cannot keep this from you. Your husband divorced you directly before your arrest. I enclose a copy of the relevant document. Farewell, Lene Wait. I'll get the key. The train arrives around eight. Is half an hour enough... for a wash, make-up and hair? Or do you need three-quarters? Well, Nelly? Calling me that, now? A slip, I guess. I'm afraid this will hurt a little. Prisoners of Auschwitz were tattooed. With a number on the forearm. Someone will ask about your number. And you'll whisper... that you cut it out. There'll be no further questions. Get out. IN THE NAME OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE! OCTOBER 4, 1944... JOHANNES LENZ... DIVORCE... NELLY LENZ I don't believe it. It's so... I don't know... Come have a hug. I told Wolfgang... Nelly will be back, I know it. If only he could see you, too... If... Well, Nelly... Christina is dead. My child is dead. But now go over to Johnny. There he is. Let's go, kids. The food's getting cold. We missed you. Two days ago I passed the studio. The circular bench where you always sat together. The street lighting was back on. A piano was playing inside. Someone was singing. I shut my eyes. And for an instant it was as it used to be. Yes... And now here you are, Nelly. I don't have to close my eyes to see you. And I never will again. To your being back again, Nelly. - To Nelly. - To Nelly. - Cheers. Nelly... You are my love. You are my life. No matter what. Come on. All of you come. "Speak Low". - "Speak Low". - Yes. I always wished... to sing with Johnny again... one day... in Berlin... BABELFISCH TRANSLATIONS Thomas Cooper
