Fucking tree. All right, so... Yeah, man. What are you doing? Taking care of business, man. Back, back, back. Okay, hold on. Nice. Kick it in. You kick it in. You're stronger. You're stupider. You won't feel the pain. I'm not crawling through that and cutting myself to shit. I'm going to reach in and unlock it, ass hammer. Now help me find something to break it with. Yeah, man. Yeah, man. Ready? What were you doing? He's going to cut off our thumbs. I'm s-- Are you serious? Yes! He's not going to cut our thumbs off. Oh, no? No. Garry... Okay, look, I did not say, "Kick him in the shins, " did I? No. I said, "Break his leg. " That means you take a sledgehammer and you hit him right above the knee until you hear a sound, and that sound is like a rifle going off-- Crack! Okay? If he continues to fuck with this, you tell him I will go over there personally and cut off his thumbs. Fuck! Do you understand that? Do you? Leggy breaky, go. Hey, Omar. What's up, Oms? Got problems? Mmm. First of all, my problems are none of your business. Second, what's with this Oms shit? It's not my name. My name is Omar. It should be easy for you to remember. Omar. As in you owe me, Owe-mar, money, huh? What you want me to call you? Ro? And De?| Fuck! You got a lighter? I can work with Ro. There you go. Anyways, what is your business is the 1, 700 you owe me. Omar, it's actually-- But you can't pay. Lucky for you, you're about to be gainfully employed. What? Oh! Yeah. What, you forgot to tell him? I didn't tell him yet. Royce and I had a talk about your situation. I suggested he turn out that hooker friend of his. Yeah, she's not a hooker. Yeah, right. Anyway, Royce had an idea. Woo! This is brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! You guys are both nuts. Yeah, because you didn't think of it, Dexter. Yeah, it never occurred to me to push drugs to pay off my debt to a drug pusher. Aw, man, you've been a drug puller for so long, it's time you start pushing! What if we don't cover what we owe? This is drugs, man. You give 'em a little, they come crawling back. It's like shooting fish in a river. It's barrel. Shooting fish in a barrel. And that's exactly why I don't want to do this. I know, but you're not doing this to pay back Omar. You're doing this to buy time. For what? I'll show you. You know whose house that is? I'm going to say the mayor's. It's Jason and Irene Taylor's house. Bingo. Who is that? Don't you read? No, he doesn't read. They're rich people. Here? How? Off the internet. So, Mattie... why exactly are we looking at Jason Taylor's house? There's a safe in there. A safe? A safe. And get this. The guy cracked his head open. So he's on life support at Rockwell and his wife won't leave his side. So they're not going to be home for weeks. And I know the combo. You know the combo? You know the combo? Oh, yeah! How do you know the combo? Yeah, how do you know the combo? Oh, whoa... okay. What? You were working in there. Mattie. Turning tricks for this guy Taylor? I'm sorry, but I'm not a streetwalker. I don't turn tricks. I go on business dates. We had an agreement. Screw the stupid agreement. You know my heart belongs to you boys. You know I hate to shatter this touching yet troubling moment, but... why would a millionaire keep his money at home? He's a hippie, and I guess hippies don't believe in banks. Hippies don't believe in banks? No. His bad. Stupid. Do we really need to start a crime wave to pay back 1, 700 bucks? It's not a crime wave. It's a crime... Ripple. Ripple. You guys are out of your minds. You know what your problem is? You have no ambition. Last night out in the dark  I was watching werewolves in the park  Stoned, uh uh-uh-uh  I used to run with that pack  Till they my broke my balls and cracked my jack  Stoned, uh uh-uh-uh  Drug love  Just like the words from an old love letter  The scars I wear aren't that much better  When I'm stoned Uh uh-uh-uh  Easy's how it used to feel  Like grease around the driving wheel  Stoned, uh uh-uh-uh  These are the days worth living  Let them all bleed down  Everything's forgiven  Uh uh-uh-uh  Uh uh-uh-uh  Yeah? Hey. What? She what? Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming. What's going on, man? She's dead. What do you mean she's dead? I mean she's not alive, man. She's... Okay, look, I passed out and then I came... back in here and she was dead. Does she have a pulse? No, she doesn't have-- Did you check? Of course I checked. We need to call a fucking ambulance. No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey! If you call an ambulance, then people are going to come around asking questions, and those questions are going to be, "Where did she get those drugs, man?" Why... did you call me? What else was I supposed to do, man? Help me get her to her feet. Come on, kid. Come on, kid. All right. Help me wake her fu-- Wake up. Wake up, Mattie. Get up, kiddo. Walk her, man. Walk her. Fuck! Sorry, man. I'm sorry. I can't do that. Oh... How long you been in here, man? A week. Where you been? She dip into Omar's junk? She didn't know what she was doing, man. Right, she accidentally bogeyed Omar's stash. You want a hit, man? You look like you could use one. No. You sure? It's not exactly going to help, is it, Royce? Look, I'm going to take a hit, and I'm going to figure out what to do with her. Oh, Mattie, what are you doing? What are you doing? No, it's not my fault  Can't you just play along with me?  We gotta get rid of her. How do you suppose we do that? Well, first-- Okay? First, I thought that we'd take her back to her place and we'd put her in her bed like she died in her sleep. And I thought, no, maybe the-- the police, they could trace it back with some carpet fiber from my place. You don't have carpet. And then it hit me, man. The drugs? The drive-in. You want to take her to a movie? No, man, the drive-in, the one I worked at last summer! The drive-in's closed, man. I know! That's the whole point! The point of what? If this was you asking for help, I'd be there for you, right? Where? Here. I-- I don't know what you mean. You know what I mean. I don't know what you mean! You know what I mean! I don't know what you mean. Hey! Hey! I did not kill her! I didn't do it! We just tried all our shit and we were having a good time! She was laughing! And we were recording shit. Lower your voice, please. We're going to figure this out, okay? Keys. Gotta get the car keys. I'm not so sure about her in a hockey bag. Let's go! Hang on, man. It's in the basement of the concession building, right? Yeah. Nobody knows about it. Careful. You sure no one's going to be out there? Well, maybe Abe goes to check things out every once in a while, but he's not going to go there this time of night. What do you mean, Abel Vinton? Yeah, yeah. You know him? Remember him? He fired me for smoking a joint at work? Yeah. Yeah, and then, in high school he thought he was king of the head-bangers? Yeah. Yeah. Then he comes back after grade 11, he's done a total 360. By the way, it's a 180. Huh? all the way back around and ended up back where he started. He did. He went back to school. You sure no one's going to see the car? Oh come on, man, only an idiot would be out here on a night like this. Turn left. This place have power? Yeah, for the alarm. Oh, shit. Maybe it's 360. Oh, yeah. Not! How about that for 360? Do you get the feeling the drugs are starting to make you slow? Man, I was on a quiz show once, you know. If I'm so slow, how'd I get on a quiz show? Ow. You were on a quiz show? Yeah, man. Quiz Time on channel 6. You mean in junior high? Yeah, me and my brother. We won 50 bucks and an Atari. That's impressive. I didn't see your college drop-out ass on Quiz Time, did I? No, you-- No, no. No, you didn't. Hang on a sec? Hurry up, man. Here. Right here. Notwithstanding your triumph on Quiz Time 300 years ago, I still think the drugs are starting to make you stupid. I'm sorry, not stupid... slow. What are you lecturing me for? Remember last year? You wrote to Tetley to pitch the idea of Ciga-tea? Yeah, man, tea with nicotine in it. That's-- That's brilliant. Your product sample was a tea bag filled with pipe tobacco. Premium tobacco, baby. Well, what about the time you wrote to Kraft with a proposal for sprayable mayonnaise? Sprayonaise. I rest my case. Todd. I know you speak English, but do you understand English? Yeah. Perhaps I wasn't clear on how you should dress. You basically said I gotta dress like my old man. Okay. Appearance is a very important part of our code. Never forget that. I didn't know the code. Shh... Shh, I told you the code. I'm going to let it pass this time, but next time... Okay. Wow. Follow me, children. Goa-ta-se. It's "Goatse, " man. Who can't read now? Keep digging, man. Whenever they find a body, the paper says they found it in a shallow grave. We've gotta make this deep. No. I can't, man. This is not some dead body. It's Mattie. You want to go to jail? I don't want to go to jail. Matilda doesn't want us to go to jail! She deserves better than this. I'm going to the can. Fucking bullshit. What's the cup for? It's a goblet. And you'll see. Let us begin. Todd Kranshaw, are you willing to renounce all loyalty to God and Jesus Christ? Yeah, man. Do you swear allegiance to the Prince of Darkness? I do. It's "I swear", Todd, not "I do. " You're not getting married. I swear! Nice. Okay. You can kneel down now, Todd. I'm going to go warm up the car. We've gotta take her to the hospital, man. We're not going to bury her like she never existed. Fuck. --as your story unfolds  From your eyes to mine  I can see  A blue wave run  And blue heat from your heart  Like nothing in the sun  Okay. I call upon the darkest of angels to anoint the blood of our new brother and reveal to him the unholy covenant of our Lord Lucifer! Hey, what are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! What the fuck are you guys doing? Throw me the key! It's just an amateur theatrical! Ugh! Which key is it? The gold one. Hey! We gotta get outta here. Someone's upstairs. Come on, we gotta go. Shit! Is there another way out of here? Uh... it's over there. Hello? Is there anyone down here? This is all just a misunderstanding. Shit. All right, man. Come on! Whoa! Hey! Whoa! Come on! Hey, hey! What? We gotta go. What about Mattie? They won't find her! We'll come back for her! Who won't find her? I think he means us. Okay, guys, hey. Royce? Royce Gordon. Abe. Hey, man! Abe? Abe! Abe! Look, man, we had to take-- I know I did-- had to take a piss and I had a key, so... So you thought while you're here, you'll bury a dead hooker. She's not a hooker. Zzzt zzzt. Wow, a little skinnier, but that is Dexter Ryan. Abe. I got an idea. Wow. Let's forget we saw each other and go our separate ways. What do you think about that? That's a great idea. You know what? And we could do it for old times sake. What old times? I fired you for smoking drugs. We were all doing something we shouldn't have been doing. Yes. Dexter, what shouldn't you have been doing to that girl? Aw, she overdosed. She overdosed. Surprise! Yeah. We were going to bury her, but we changed our minds. Yeah, we weren't going to bury her anymore. Not going to happen. What are you? Are you, like, Satan worshippers? Hey, hey, zip, zip. Zip. You are not worthy to utter his name. But, yes, we do bask in the light of the Dark Lord. You are not men! You are servo-mechanisms to addiction. No better than automatons. This is true. I would be doing you a favor if I ended your sad little lives. Actually, we're good. We're good, right? We're great, man. You know what? We're going to go this way-- Hey! Hey! Wait! Back off, both of you! Especially you, sister! You freak me out! I do not want to go crazy up in here! She's kind of pretty. Mmm, delicious. Shame she's dead. Four bodies instead of one. None of them will be missed. Let's continue. We'll do it right here. It's getting late. O Dark Lord, accept our sacrifice and infuse this blood with all the power of hell! Watch it! Sorry. Oh, my God. Bite your tongue! Sorry. Satan has made her live! Ave Satanas! All hail Satan! All hail Satan! You asshole! Ow! Ow! Get her! Ahhh! Hey! Fucking idiot! Calm down, sweetness! We won't hurt you! You're very fast! You have a beautiful stride! You're very, very pretty! No! Get her! Oh! Matilda! Mattie! Satan? More cardio! Go, go, go! Go! Go, go, go, go go, go! Whoa! Well played. Nothing like a good shovel to stop a car. Here, get this on Mattie. Put it on your legs. Were we in hell? No. We were at the drive-in. Is she okay? I don't know, man. She's passing out. Shit. There's been a problem. I need you to take the van and go to the hospital. I don't care if your mom wants you to plow the driveway! This is Lucifer's will! No, don't tell her that! You're an idiot! Todd's blood is useless now! The power contained in it is now inside that girl! Can't we just take Todd's blood and do the ceremony again? No, Seamus. Okay, once the power's out of the blood, it's out of all the blood! That's how fucking sangre sacrementus works. That doesn't seem very exact, does it? You-- Just shut up and get Todd into the freezer! What? I forgot the key. What are we supposed to do, huh? Stick him in the meat grinder? Excuse me, um, sir! Shut up! Abel. Abel! Seamus forgot the freezer key! Here's Royce's address. Put Todd in the hole those two imbeciles dug. Let's go find the girl. Do you think you can handle that? Just-- Can you not hold him like that? Jesus Christ! You know what? Watch your mouth, little missy! I know! I know, okay? I've had enough. I'll wash your mouth out with soap! Can't you help me carry him? Just shut up! Okay. Okay. Sorry.| God, that was a Goddamn miracle how those weirdos brought her the fuck back to life! She wasn't dead, man. Yo, she had no pulse. She had no pulse. No. Have you ever, in your life, taken someone's pulse? No. Me, neither. And I'm telling you, those psychos didn't raise anyone from anything. Man, I know what I saw. I know what I'm seeing now. Wha-- What's, uh... What's going on with your gack? You want it? Yeah. Why? I quit. Shut up. No, I mean, I mean it. Shut up. I'm serious. Shut up. You shut up. Shut up! You shut up. Shut-up. No, seriously, please. I mean it. I kicked. Where do you think I was all week? You okay? Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. We should call the cops, all right? Not from here! No? They could trace it. That is some CSI shit! Yup. Always on our asses! Those bastards! Where the fuck is my dope? I swear, I'll cut off their thumbs! I'll cut off their thumbs! How was it? You know, kicking? Oh, dear... It was like puking rusty gears and shitting razor blades. Ew, man. Yeah. So you really are-- You kicked for good, huh? Well, I'd twist off a puppy's head for a taste right now, but yeah, I'm kicked. Shit. Hey, good evening, lads. I don't think I introduced you to my friend Garry. Oof! Oh! Ooh! I don't blame you, Dex. You're the quiet, introspective one. Royce, sadly, is the idea man. Listen-- Shut up. I just got back from your apartment. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me like someone had one hell of a party in there. I can explain. Shut up, Royce! I'm talking now! Look at you two, hmm? You ever heard of a fucking shower? You know what your problem is? You are a disgrace to this country. In Canada, you can have anything you want if you're willing to work for it. You two couldn't hold down a fucking job if you were tied to it! So, this is what I want. I want the 1, 700 you owe me in cash, plus the cash value of the drugs I kindly entrusted you. That's fair. Plus $600 bullshit tax. Or you can forgo the tax and, uh, Garry here can drop this stone on your face. Which is it? Bullshit tax! Bullshit tax. Good choice! Add it up for them, Garry. in cash, by last call. Oh, man. "Oh, man. " Fucking, "Oh, man. Oh, fucking man". Okay. You're right. Okay? I'll be there after my game. We're curling tonight. He's my skip. Let's go. Playoffs tonight. You know what, Garry, fuck it. Yeah, let's show them. Throw the stone. Hey, hey, hey!| Take it easy!| Come on. You and Mattie blow through that whole stash? Huh? Did you and Mattie blow through that whole stash? No, dude, of course I saved some. You know she's a hog. Give it to me. Oh, come on, man. Just... give it to me. Don't do it, Dex. Come on, man. You were just talking about how hard it was to kick, dude. Fuck. Hey, Dex. Hey, Mattie. How you feeling? Huh. I think I was dead. Yeah. I saw my mom. She was so sad. She showed me hell. It was so fucked up, Dex. This voice as big as the sky went... "Matilda. " Oh, Mattie, what are you doing? What are you doing? No, seriously. What am I doing? What are you doing, Dex? I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who isn't? You still going to call the cops? Nope. Where are we going? We got work to do. I have been  Terrified  By the thought of losing you  So very terrified  By the thought of losing you  I've been petrified  Hey, man, look. This tree's still got a leaf on it. Yeah. It's nice. Shall we? Opa! O-- Okay! Was that completely necessary? Don't be a dick. Where does the other one live? I don't know. Why don't you check the Yellow Pages under "junkies"? Hey, take it easy! What's the big deal? We're robbing these people. Let's not add insult to injury. Keep it dark, please, just in case. Yes, master... bater. Hey, listen to this. "Though Taylor's I. P. O. has scored him millions, "his true passion is the New Age Center he started after settling in Weedsville in 1977. " What a crazy fuck. Hey, man, I know this place. Yeah, I took yoga there. You took yoga? Yeah, man. It enhances the high. How'd that work out for ya? I got kicked out. What for? Sporting wood. Listen to this. She wrote a song. ... sayin' you shouldn't try  I really think you should try-yi-yi  I tried to fight it  But now I'm on my knees  It's not my fault  If I can't hold on  I'm not that strong, no!  It's not my fault...  Beautiful voice. Maybe she'll sing for Lucifer when she meets him. Man, we should have gone to my place first. I got flashlights and me and Matilda, we drew up a plan. You drew up a plan? Do you keep it in your evidence bag? Yeah, bingo. That's it. Here? Yeah, man, right in there. Shit. Shit. Is it locked? I can crack that knob, man. Have at it, knob-cracker. Ready? Yeah. Hey! Oh. Oh. All right, man, let's get this open before that kid wakes up. Right. What kid? How'd you knock him out? Oh, man, I hit him with the-- that elf thing that we broke in with. Gnome. Yeah, okay. Whatever. What is it, a leprechaun? Gnome. You know what I mean? Like the... the Smurf thing that we-- I hit the br-- hit the window with? What Smurf? Gnome. What are you saying, man? You're stoned. You keep saying "no". It's been a while. It was a leprechaun. "No. " Elf? "No. " What's this? The Taylor house. Come on. There it is. Yeah, there it is. You going to open it? Me? Yeah, you're the one that knows the combo. I didn't memorize it, man. I wrote it down. You know, I think you might've mentioned that before we broke In here. Oh, I didn't think of it. You didn't think of it? No. We have a safe to crack, the contents of which could save our lives, and you didn't think of it? I know, that sucks. Yeah, that sucks. That sucks. Start the night burying a body and it's usually right down the hill from there, isn't it? Oh, that's so true. So true. Ow! It's a sign. It's gotta be a sign. Maybe it's a coincidence. Lucifer sent them to the drive-in to test our faith, Seamus, and now we've been rewarded. Three of them, three of us, same configuration of men and women. That's no coincidence. Technically, there were four of us that went to the drive-in-- Are you doubting? No. Doubt is the enemy of faith, Seamus. You had doubts when you first started. Seamus is going to come to understand this. Can you move your seat up, please? Can you get in the car, please? Shh, shh! Hello? Good. How does he look? Mmm, no, no, no. Don't meet us at the movie theater. Meet us at the New Age Center. Get everything set up and wait for us there. Okay. Okay. Okay... first stair. Go. Good, good, good, good, hold! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm okay. Fuck! Yeah. Struggle, struggle, struggle  Struggle all day long  Struggle, struggle, struggle  Struggle all day long  Get up in the morning and try to keep on  I got pain in my stomach, I got pain in the chest  Pain in the eyelid, pain in the wrist... Stuck, huh? Yeah, it's locked. Oh, it's locked. Yeah, it's... locked. ... you try to keep on  I got the devil beside me  The Lord's above reach  The preacher right next to me  Preach, preach, preach  Struggle, struggle, struggle  Struggle all day long  Get up in the morning and try to keep on  What the fuck? Jesus! Ah... Uh, d-don't hurt me, okay? Please! Shut up! Shut up! Take whatever you want! Okay. We need to get into your basement door. Oh, my what? Your basement door. Look, I'm not into dudes, okay? Hey, no, no, no, no, no! No! What are you talking about? Look, just wear a rubber, okay? And be gentle-- We need a key for the deadbolt on your basement door, please! Time out! The key! Yeah, the key. There's a key ring in the kitchen. You can try that, okay? Water. There you go. Thank you. You okay? Well, how does it look? How does what look? My face! Your face looks fine. You look-- You look great. Okay. What are you doing here anyway? This is my uncle's house. He'll fucking kill you, man. What are you talking about, man? He killed a dude in this bathtub right here, okay? He's a fucking ninja. All right. He's got ninja stars, swords and shit. All right. He just hides them down the back of his shirt. You have no idea the rain of pain that's coming your way, okay? Do you mind just shutting the fuck up for about five minutes? We'll be out of here. Thank you. Cupboard, cupboard, cupboard. Yeah. Sweet. Mother of God. Got 'em! What's up? Oh, f-- Uh... woo. Well, anyway... The man's got plans. Oh! Shame on you. Each of those girls is someone's daughter. Yeah. That's a good point. Ooh... hello! Oh, hey! Oh, no, come on. You definitely shouldn't be smoking this shit. I'm calling the cops. Yeah, you want to wind up like Retardo Montalbn over here? I don't think so. I don't smoke it that much, okay? Anyway, I got an idea. Yeah? Heck, yeah. Just go pull the car to the front door. Okay. I'm going to take care of our little... here, you know. Be careful. I got it, man. I got it. Me and you gotta talk. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shit. Days are not faint  I'm still losing it  Name a lung  Yes, I'm dry  The storybook is still on time  Ooh! Ooh, easy come, easy go. Hey. Can I speak to you for a sec? Oh, excellent, man! Yeah. What are you doing? I'm getting the kid high. Oh, really? Yeah, man. I put crank in it though, so he's not even going to remember that we were here. What are you, the CIA? Of course he's going to remember we were here. Maybe, but he'll be a little hazy, dude. Dude. Tell my buddy about what really happened to your uncle. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Didn't he fall and crack his head? Ha, ha, ha, ha. No. No, man, that's not what happened. Okay, he was walking home from the bank, right? Umpf. Unh, mm. Hmm. Circus people. Whoaooah... Hey, man, you-- you got an icicle sticking out of your head. An elephant... picnic... marvel. Whoa, whoa, back up, back up, back up. What was he doing at a bank? I don't know. Okay, that's funny. I feel bad laughing about it, you know, but it's just so Ripley's. Believe it or not, it happened! Fun, fun. You having fun? It's funny, man. Yeah? Can we go? Oh, yeah. Hey, dude, you're not going to call the cops, right? Just leave my weed and we're even. No. Not leaving the weed. But come on, man. I'm having a girl over later. You got a girl coming over? You got these tapes, man. She's a total freak! Yeah, man! All right. Hey, listen. Okay. I'm going to leave you tied up, okay? If you have to. And, um, I want you to have... a great time! Okay. See you, kid. See you guys. Fuck. Guys? Guys, it went out! Hey, you hear that kid? Taylor was at a bank. What's a guy who doesn't believe in banks doing at a bank? I don't know. That was him! Follow them! You okay to drive? Yeah, man, I'm all right. I feel goo... You feel "goo"? Behind us! Fuck! Did anyone see if the girl was even in the car? Uh, I only saw two coconuts in the car. She's the one we really need. Perhaps she's back at the house. I think you lost them. Yeah! Yeah. Shit! She's overheating. How does a car overheat in the winter? Just pull over and we'll find a place where she can cool down. What are we doing here, exactly? Well, your car is busted and... Yes. ... we've gotta crack that safe open. Yes, we do. There's a car-full of nut-bags after us, so we could do something we haven't done in a very long time. You want to break into the mall. Okay. Yeah! Oh, wow, hot tub. Look at that. You wanna stop for a soak? Yeah! Whew. Ow! What the fuck? Fuck, you're slow. What did Abel mean about uh... uh, servicing... You mean servo-mechanisms to addiction? That's it. Yeah, he meant our only function in life is to do drugs. He was quoting Marshall McLuhan, but he was quoting him wrong. Wait, isn't he the guy who started the Sex Pistols? No, that's Malcolm McLaren. Marshall McLuhan's a Canadian. Whoa, a Canuck started the Sex Pistols? God! Fuck! God, you gotta be kidding me, oh! She's not in the house. Who's that? The nephew. Take him. Why do I gotta do all the lifting? Ah. Boys, this is a medieval battle flail. Ow! Jesus. Oh! What the fuck are you doing, man? It's a practice weapon. The real one would've turned your head to pudding. Ow! Man, there are people chasing us. That's why we broke in here. We needed a place to hide. There's a cult after us. Did you say "cult"? Yes, I did. Like, the Moonies? Sorta, but worse. Oh, I see. Now, you boys wouldn't be shitting me, would you? This is the place where we lost them, which means they either went to the mall or back into town. They'd have to be retarded to go to the mall this time of night. The mall. The mall. My sister was a Moonie back in the '80s. It cost us four grand to get her de-programmed. Moonies took her for 20. Parasites. Did you boys escape from those bastards? Yes, we did. I just spent three days in a motel de-programming him... but they found us. What about this? It's a fucking pharmacy here. It was the only way I could get through to him, sir. You don't say. I do say. Your story touches me, boys. But if I find out you're lying, there'll be repercussions. Cops? Fuck the cops... and their height requirements. I'll come after you myself. You'll wish I called the cops. Here. Thank you. Take it easy with that shit. I know you got stuff to deal with, but... it's who you are up here that counts. True. Take me for instance. In my mind, I'm 6'4", So, in your head you're tall and skinny? That's really... That's not that big. Boys, the point is, you cross me, asses get kicked. Yes. Names get taken. True. Oh, speaking of names, do you think we could have our IDs back? Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Shit, that's one of 'em! Boys, this way. We're going to the hydro room. There's a grate in the floor that leads to a drainage pipe. It'll take you across the highway and into the woods. Go, go, go, go! Godspeed, lads. Oh, hey, what are you going to do? I'm going to kick some Moonie ass. Okay. He's a nice guy, eh? Yeah, that "nice guy" just took your 100 bucks. I don't care, man. You know what? It's karma, dude. You know what? Fuck karma. You're kidding me. Shut the fuck... What are you doing? They're probably following the trail of smoke. I'm lighting this joint. You really think we have time to stop and smoke a joint? I'm stopping to light the joint. I'll smoke it on the way. Don't be shitty. Just fucking go. Fucking tell me about fucking lighting a joint. Just shut up. I'm going! Come on, man, please? I'm walking, man. Look behind you. That's so cute! Shh! Shh! Something funny? Hi. What are you supposed to be? He's like the little Chief of Police of, like, Munchkin-land or something. A Wizard of Oz joke. That's very original. I never hear those. You two have violated mall bylaw 2378. Have you by any chance seen two young men running around here tonight? Are you deaf? I'm placing you under citizen's arrest. Ooh!| Yikes. You and uh... um... you? By yourself? All alone? Me and, uh... Mr. Pepper-spray here. Drop the hatchet. Lose the weapon, and hit the floor. All right. Okay. Sorry. Ow... I'm just going to get down. I'll just put my machete down on the floor-- ooh! Oh, look, I've got your pepper spray! Zzzt. Oh, you want to play? Hyuh! Argh! Uh! Now, you... grab some floor-sandwich and start eating! Green light! Red light! Sit! Shake a paw! Gotcha! Hey! Want to take him for a little helicopter ride? Whoaaa! It smells here. Your butt's in my face. Would you just shut the fuck up? Don't get on your high heels just because you kicked, all right? I kicked because my life was spiraling into the toilet. Yeah, so was mine, Dex, but at least I tried to do something about it. You tried to do something about it? Yeah, I got the job with Omar. Me and Matilda came up with the Taylor heist. What did you do? I rode in on a white horse when all of your best-laid plans culminated in the pressing need to bury one of your best fucking friends! Shut-- Shut up, man! You're the one who got us in debt with Omar! It's your fault! Why do you think I kicked? Oh, God, thank you! Dex quit for a week! The world is healed! There's peace on earth! You know what? You're a fucking chickenshit! Dumb fuck! Dumb quitter! Where did they go? Inchon sucked, you fuckin' Moonie! Not nice. Idiot! One more time. Where did they go? Moonie bastard! One more time. Where did they go? Fuck you. Oh my, what do we have here, Officer Oz? Oh, just what we need. Looks like we got 'em. Beautiful nothing  Is all I wanna hear  Beautiful nothing  Music to my ear  So stop all your bang-clangin'  Shouting and stompin' around  Beautiful nothing  Fuck. Come on, let's go. No. I'm staying. Shut up. Get up. I'm good. No, no, no, no... Hey. Warm. No. No, no, Dex, you're going to get hypodermia. No, Dex, you're going to freeze to death, man. No, I'm good. Hey! Come on! Get up now! What are you doing? Get up! Quit hugging me! I'm not hugging you! I'm trying to carry you. Quit it! I can walk! Damn, I'm not hugging you. Quit it! I'm trying to carry you, all right? Do you hear me? Let's get out of here. No, no, no. No, no, no. This way. Anthony? Martin here. We got a code blue. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Oh, my God, are you boys okay? No. What are you doing out here? You're freezing! Yeah, yeah. You're dripping wet. Come on, get in the car. You look so cold. Come on, man. You, too. You boys should get out of those clothes, you'll warm up faster. Don't be shy. I once lived in a nudist commune in Brazil. I know what a naked man looks like. Looks like you're having about as bad a day as I am. My husband went missing from the hospital tonight. I fell asleep in the lounge and when I woke up, they told me he was gone. Just like that, huh? Wow. Oh, where are my manners? I'm Irene Taylor. Oh, I'm Royce and this is Dex.| Nice to meet you, boys. Why was he in the hospital? The weirdest accident. An icicle fell and stuck into the top of his head. It nestled down in the lobes of his brain. Doctor said he'd be okay once the initial shock wore off. Oh, man. My nephew's house-sitting for us. I don't know where the hell he got to. You boys wait here. I don't want you catching pneumonia. Oh, my God, we gotta book, man. Naked? I don't know. We gotta take her car and get to the mall, man. Again... naked? Rufus! Be very careful with her. Ow. Punish them if they return. Come on in. Wow, it looks like something went right through your floor. Are you calling the cops? Much as I hate to, I gotta. Because us two aren't exactly the Hardy Boys, if you know what I mean. I figured. Hello, police? It's Irene Taylor. Oh, yeah. Yeah! Crossbow. Thor's hammer. War club. Battle flail. Gentlemen... '94 VW hatchback with blue running lights. Let's roll! Jeremy, you little shit! Where's my hundred bucks? Maybe you shouldn't have fucking taken it, should you? No. I'm all tapped out now, but my name and number is on the back of this card. That's okay, you've done enough. No, I know what it's like to be on the road. Enjoy it while you can because before you know it, you'll have a house full of stuff you don't need and deep down don't really want. Like a floor with a hole in it? Awkward. To tell you the truth, I kinda liked things better when we had nothing. Thank you. Thank you. Bye! I feel like an asshole. Yeah, me too. But that's okay. We'll just take enough from the safe to pay Omar. Yeah. Give the rest back. Yeah, man, yeah. Okay? Yeah, absolutely. Ah, shit. You know what, man? What? We make it through this, man, I'm kicking. I'm going to turn everything around. You serious? Yeah. Ave Satanas! Jeremy. Jeremy, it's Matilda. What are you doing here? I don't-- I don't know. What are we doing-- We gotta get out of here. Okay, okay. Be still! Get your hands off me, bitch! Safety first! Unlock the door! Safety first-- Oh, boy! Oh, God. Move, move, move, move! Go, go, go! Take it where? Turn where? There! There! Fine! Lock your doors! Go! Very special. Angels. What? Angels! I'm going to die! No, no, no! Not the car! No insurance! Oh! Stop it! Give them some candy! Oh, fuck! Shit. How am I going to fix that? I'm going to kill them! I'm going to kill them! Not so bad now, are you, Moonie motherfucker? Grow up! This is not-- Whatever! Get out of the car. I'm not getting out of the car! Be strong! Run! Ah! Ow.| One little Satanic ritual. Is that too much to ask? Well done, boys. Double doubles on me. Woo, yeah! Rock, rock, rock, rock  We're gonna rock, rock-- We fucking rock  We rock  We fucking rock  The lights are on, man. Oh, Matilda, she must be up. She must be up. Matilda's up. Shit! What? What the fuck is he doing here? Would you get the fuck down? Do you think he-- Shh! You shhh! Shh! Shut the fuck up, man. You shut the fuck up. Why would you do that? I don't know. Now what? I got an idea. What? What is that? Liquid morphine. Where'd you get liquid morphine? From my dentist. This shit'll make him talk. Some CIA shit. You have a dentist? What is he, dead? I don't know. Wanna wake him up? Hello? Hey! Hi. I used to be like you guys before I met Abel. Off drugs and into religion. Fun trade. With Satan you kill others, not yourself. You don't feel like killing anyone else now though, do you? No. So where's Mattie? Mattie... The New Age Center. Where are you going? Nowhere, obviously. You're not giving up. What's the point? Lucifer is supposed to be helping us, not plaguing us with midgets and junkies. Fine. What is the point? What are we trying to prove? Who cares what some old hippie thinks of us? I mean, you obviously don't anymore. It all started with him. It started... with him. Abel got into trouble when he was 16. He was sent to a youth camp run by Jason Taylor. And then he gave him a book. Collected Works of Aleister Crowley. After that, Abel read everything he'd get his hands on. Malleus Maleficarum. The Lesser Key of Solomon. LaVey's Satanic Bible. That's a good one. Abel burned with desire for arcane knowledge. And I began to see patterns, truths... All leading to the same place... The very heart of Satan. If it wasn't for him, he wouldn't be where he is today. He made you what you were without even knowing it. When this is done... The circle will be complete. The circle will be complete. Abel's going to awaken Jason Taylor from his coma by feeding him the blood of the girl. That is the stupidest fucking thing I ever heard. And that includes everything this guy ever said. Yeah! Won't seem stupid when it works. Yeah? We've lost the girl. She wandered into the warehouse district. Were those knights? They were angels. And who were those other guys? They were demons. I saw them in hell. Oh, of course. Oh... come on. Come on. Oh, my head is killing me. Look... l-let's go back to my uncle's place and get freaky. I can't. I got a big bunch of weed and 50 bucks! What more could you want? I don't do that anymore. Since when? Since I spoke to God, Jeremy. And he specifically said, "Do not have sex with Jeremy anymore?" Jeremy, I'm serious. I have a purpose, okay? I'm not really sure what it is yet, but I'm not going to ever know if I'm whoring around for drug money. Yeah, well, you suck. Tss, not anymore I don't. You broke both his legs? I-- I thought you... I-- I broke both his legs. Fuck. Good. No, I thought you would break one leg. But if you're going to break two, you know, that makes it harder to walk. Well, you were so upset about the first time. Well, yeah. I mean, you know. You can't, you know... I figure I'd make up for it by breaking both legs. Well, there's that-- now he's learned his lesson. Otherwise he's going to walk around like this. Hello. Hello. My name is Sam. I don't have any fucking thumbs. You know? Listen, Mattie, I want to thank you for all the stuff we've done together. It really... boosted my confidence, you know? It makes me feel like a man. That-- That means something to me. I want you to know that I think of you as, like... a teacher. Thanks, Jeremy. That's really sweet. So how about one last time, hmm? Ow! Jeremy! Hey, you! You! No fighting! What? You're outta here. But-- But I didn't do nothin'! Ow! Please, sir, you can't just-- just leave me outside all by myself! Please! Oh, God, how did we-- how did we that? Where have you guys been? Oh, never mind. How are you? Do you have that combo... on you? Do you remember that? Let's check the bar. Come on. Mattie, please! No! We just need the combo. No! Come on, Mattie. Come on, Matilda, just give us the combo! Please! No. Why not? Please? I'm a different person now. Stealing's an easy way out. Yeah, but you see-- you see, the hard way out is-- is Omar killing us. Omar's not going to kill you. He's a pussy... cat! Well, I really-- I really, you know-- I don't want test that theory, Mattie. Please. Yeah. One condition. Anything! Anything. You guys quit. Both of you guys! Well, he already did. Sorta. Dexter, you really quit? When did you quit? I quit, like, about a week ago. That's so good! Don't you feel so good? I feel pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Because I was telling Jeremy, like, we can't live our lives like this. You know, there's-- Oh, Jeremy, Jeremy? Yeah, who's Jeremy? Jeremy. Jason Taylor's Jeremy? Yeah, he was in the car when the angels rescued us. Ah, she was the freaky chick he was telling me! You were turning tricks with that little bastard? Not anymore.| You're saying "not anymore!" That's how much he paid you? It's the combo, shithead.| That's the combo? Yes. Oh, you're so good. Thank you! God! And to think we almost buried you tonight. What? What the-- I mean... You guys what almost me? Arggh! Why would you do that? God! I mean... I don't know why you'd say that. I mean, she gave us the combo and then you said we-- we were going to bury her tonight. I mean I just think that's really-- That just shows lack of intelligence on your part. I just don't understand why you'd do that sort of thing. Hey! Guys? Oh, shit!| Yah! Is that enough to kill them? It's enough to kill a horse. Okay, let's go find these losers and, uh... give the hospital some business. What if they're just late? You sure you don't want to wait? Oh, Garry, you're a poet and you don't even know it. Let me try. Uh, roses are red, violets are blue, don't be a pussy and let's get the fuck out of here. Hey, guys.| Very well done. Your mom okay with you taking the van? Cool. She'll be rewarded. Can you stick around for this? It's going to be glorious. I gotta plow the driveway. All right. Be gone. Walk with Satan. Don't step on the pentagram. Nice. What are you doing, Dex? What did you say? Hey. What? You okay? No. No, I'm fucked. Yeah, man, that's because you quit. Yeah, quit. She used that stuff I cut with... Baby powder. What? Yeah, I was trying to fuck over a guy in Lumsden. Baby powder? I really like this feeling. Oh! Oh, no! No, man, no. What? No, we gotta get outta here. We gotta go get the safe. Oh, shit! We gotta-- Get up! We gotta get Mattie. Yeah, too. That-- Her, too. Oh, you have any monkey? Do you mean money? What did I say? You said "monkey. " "Do you have any monkey?" Do you mean money? Dude, man, I don't have a monkey, man. Don't I know you? Oh! Yeah! How freaky is she now? Hey, hey, here's 50 bucks. Let's go. Omar? It's Dex. You want your money? Meet us at the New Age Center. We rock  We fucking rock  Shit! Ahhh! Get away from her. Or else what? Or else... that! Damn! Don't do that. Damn dirty apes. Ow! Ooh! Didn't hurt. Whoa! Wait! Abel, I got an idea. Take me instead. Take me. Take me instead. Let Mattie go. Look at her, man. She doesn't deserve this. What are you doing? What? He might actually do that! I know. You would really die for her? Yeah. Wow. I bet you feel like a real piece of shit right now. I don't know what you just said, freaky girl, but I'm sure I don't like it! I don't want either of them. Hey! Hey! Whoa! "Whoa" is right! What are you doing here? This is all wrong. The crosses are upside-down. Why wouldn't she be upside-down? And the pentagram, man, this looks wrong. You know what? I will not brook any more of your interruptions! I mean, you've got one point of the pentagram pointed at the altar instead of two, like devil's horns. Everybody knows that. I looked this up. He doesn't know what he's talking about. I know this shit. I listened to the same bands you did in high school. What the fuck is this? Hi. What's going on, Dex? Long story. Hey, I've got time, if you've got my money. In my car. Oh... What are you looking at, huh? I-I think you might want to put that down. I don't think so. Oh, you don't think so? Okay. Maybe-- Maybe I should go? Should I go? Or how about this? Hmm? Hmm? Cheers! Maybe put knifey knifey down a little bit? How about this? Ahhh! Sorry, man. Oh! Money, honey. Let's go, boys, before someone calls the authorities. Yeah! Dexter? Yeah? Is that my money? Be my guest. Yeah, if you let us go. Sure. Go. Let's get you home, Mr. Taylor. I have a home? Lucifer? You can take me now. My work here is done. Cleanse me with the fires of hell. You there, Seamus? Yeah. I think so. You guys are my only real friends. I'm going to miss you. I'll save you a seat by the fire. At least let us move the safe, okay? Hey, it will be a lot easier to move once I got all the money out, right? Lucifer, can you hear me? You can take me. Fuck! Still waiting. The mouse... said you'd come. What? What? What did you say? I don't recall. All I did was give Abel a book. Who knew he'd run with it? I got an idea. Mm? Sprayonaise, hmm? It's yours. If you want it, you got it! You know, that'll more than pay for what we took from the safe. Oh, yeah. Do you mean... sprayable mayonnaise? Yes. Organic? Yes! Huh. Well, you've burned your bridges  Pull on that bad boy. And you paid the cost  But you find a way  To get across  'Cause it all | Works out  In the end somehow  It all works out  Somehow  You hang out your heart  And you watch it bleed  But you find a way  To believe  'Cause it all  Works out  In the end somehow  It all works out  Somehow  It all works somehow  Time says you'll be making your way back home  Before you know it  So let's go  Sign says only 230 kilometers to go  And your still talking to me like an animal  That's got the gum disease, rabies and fleas  I won't bite you  Slow down  This world's already turning fast enough  It seems every time that I'm pleased  I have this little disease just feeding on me  I guess that this reminds me  That life is just too damn short to dick around  But I just can't help myself  I said  Time says you'll be making your way back home  Before you know it  So let's go  Sign says only 230 kilometers to go  Time says you'll be making your way back home  Before you know it  So let's go  Sign says only 230 kilometers to go  Yeah  It seems every time that I'm pleased  I have this little disease just feeding on me  I guess that this reminds me  That life is just too damn short to dick around  But I just can't help myself  I said  Time says you'll be making your way back...  Home before you know it  Nothing goes together like a cigarette and a hot beverage, but the truth is... cigarettes can kill. I've tried to quit, but I'm helplessly addicted to nicotine. Then you need Ciga-tea. Tea with nicotine in it? That's right. Tea with nicotine in it. Ciga-tea has already helped thousands of people kick the deadly smoking habit. I'm ready to kick butts! So what's my line? Uh... Would you care for a cigarette? No, thanks. I'd rather have Ciga-tea. Mmm! Thank you, Ciga-tea!
