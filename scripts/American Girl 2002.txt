Hey, Rena! Where'd you get that snappy outfit, lost and found? Funny. How much wide-mouth suburban trash does it take to screw in a light bulb? How much? If you don't know, nobody does. Where do you get off calling us trash? If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. Hurry up before someone sees. Hey, Kenton. You know the rule. I know. Stay put. Hi! Stay down. I know. It's nice here, don't you think? It's better than the car. Oh, yeah. I can't do anything today, Kenton. What do you mean? Look... do you want to come to dinner with us? It doesn't have to be anywhere public. It can just be at our house, right? Wait here. (car door opens, closes) (engine starts, car drives away) Kenton and me had us a real unusual relationship. He summed it up once by saying, "put out or get out." So I decided to get out. Mama says that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I was barreling down the express lane. And I sure as hell never saw any damn exit ramps, either. So I started to try and construct my own exit ramps. So much is missing with daddy missing. I wonder who's going to miss me when I go missing. Mama married daddy forever, until death do them part. Ironically, that obligation was killing her. Rena Jo Grubb, what the hell are you doing? Dying a slow and torturous death. Baby, I've been doing that for the last five years. You hear anything about your brother? He'll be home tonight, mama. Don't worry. Honey, get dressed. I'll bet he's grown a foot. Hope y'all recognize him. Hey, boys and girls, moms and dads, come on down to fun fun city with rides, attractions, amusements, and candy... you better come in here and do the dishes. Mama wants things nice. 'Cause Jay's coming home. So exciting... you got any idea why your sister's in that pool like some mental patient? What are you doing out there? Shit! Do they bite right in here? Uncle Arno! I got a... thanks, uncle Arno, for taking me fishing, letting me tinker on the bikes and stuff. Don't you go changing. That was the longest four weeks of my life. It's a lot like being with daddy, only he's a lot slower and don't hit quite as hard. Hey, Rena. Welcome home, sissy boy. Don't get up. Mom. Jay! Baby. It is so good to see you! Oh, my goodness, you grew. Did you like fishing with your uncle Arno? It was okay. Yeah? Did you catch anything? I don't know. Does he have anything? You... (laughing) I'm going to go change. Okay. Rena, get your butt in here! Your skings going to get all pruney. Honey, your daddy sent you another postcard. Don't you even think about tracking that mud in here. Jay, get your sister a towel. Jay! Whatever, whatever. Just give me this. I love to read you nursery rhymes  me and you, you know, it's our private time  and I'll always be with you  welcome home, Jay, welcome home, Jay  welcome home, Jay, Jay junior  welcome home, Jay, welcome home, Jay  welcome home, Jay, Jay jun...  come on, you guys. welcome home, Jay, welcome home, Jay  welcome home, Jay, Jay junior  Christ, he was only three trailers away. Try eight. I know, but we missed our little baby boy. So long as we're celebrating and everything... are we going to go to daddy's picnic? What picnic is that, honey? The one they have every year. The picnic. You know, I think it's the last weekend in June. The annual picnic they have every year in June, mama. Honey, I probably have to work that day. It's been eight years. I think it's important that we go and see him sometimes. We're not going. I damn sure am not going. Mama, I think we should go. Please? I'll think about it. Yeah, well, don't hurt yourself, all right? I hate it when you think about things. It always means "no." I wrote him saying we'd go, so he's expecting us. Did he mention the picnic in his postcard? No. Interesting. Morning, Faye. Morning, Madge. Your garden is looking so nice. I've been meaning to tell you. What do you want, Madge? I've been thinking about taking the kids to see John. You think that's a good idea? I think it's a dreadful idea. But you should take Rena. She needs to meet the son of a bitch. Right. Okay, Faye, thanks. You have a nice day now. OK. Yeah, OK. So we going? I don't know. What do you think? I think it's a bad idea. Well, I've still got a month to get used to it. You hungry? Hm-mm. Here. All right. Good night. Night, baby. "And slippery, slippery Sam, he fell upon the ham." It's bedtime now, all right, Rena? Your daddy loves you, okay? Morning, Faye. You know what I realized? Our problems come from not having a daddy around. Everything sucks 'cause he's not around. Why don't we just go and see him? It's not like he's dead or nothing. Especially since we practically have ourselves an invitation. I know he thinks about us. I have every single postcard he's ever sent me. I thought I heard you babbling away. Want some cookies, hon? No, that's okay. But I made you... a rose. I know you don't like to pick yours, so... how lovely. I need it back, though, okay? You know, Rena... I think it is time you did see your daddy. You think so? Uh-huh. Yeah, I think so, too. Hey, mama. I brought you this. Thank you, Rena. What do you want? Do you ever think that maybe daddy doesn't do anything because we never tell him nothing? Five minutes of peace, please. Well, I think he deserves a chance to be a daddy. Baby, sometimes I think you don't remember your daddy so good. There's not that much to remember. A kiss on the cheek, a bedtime story... I just really want to go, mama. What is so important about this damn picnic this year? Because it is! He's my dad! Mama, please! I really want to go. Mama, please! Okay, we'll go. Okay, honey. Will you go get me a beer, please? (delighted shriek) Hurry up, before someone sees. Hey. You know the rule. I know. Stay put. I'm staying. (rap music plays on radio) Knock, knock. What do you want? Baby, I said, "knock, knock." How do you feel about going to see your daddy? I don't know. It might be a good idea for us all to go and see him. I mean, is it something you want to do, or do you want to talk about... I'll go. Okay, we might have fun. I don't know. I'll be home after 6:00. Why are you so sweaty? It's hot in here. Hey, you ever think about going to the magic kingdom? Not particularly. I bet it's just about the happiest place on earth. Yeah, that's why they call it "the happiest place on earth," mom. I sure wish we could go there instead of to see your daddy. You're not really thinking about going there, are you? Rena wants to go. I want to win the lotto, so... here, you want some? No, no, no. I missed my last couple of visits. The time there, it's not so bad, but it takes my soul a day or two to recover. You know how things is. Yeah, I know how things is. Barbie, I'm not going to make you go, but... your daddy sure would like it. He always loved you. I know. Just like you was one of his own. Yeah. So what do you say? I guess I will if I have to. Didn't I just say you didn't have to? Come on, hurry up! I have to go, and I have to go now! (coughing) What's going on in there? What? What's going on? Yeah, I'm just feeling pukey, Thats all. Uh-huh, uh-huh. What kind of pukey? I don't know. I'm just sick, I guess. Uh-huh. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking you shouldn't be expecting to see your ruby slippers any time soon. I don't know what you're talking about. Who's the daddy, Rena? What are you going on for? Just tell me who the daddy is. Who is he? What are you going on about? Mama's going to just about shit. Mama's got no reason to shit, all right? She was 15 when she had you. Right. Barbie, I need you for this once just to be my friend. Daddy's going to be so proud of his little slut. I've got a heart murmur, you know! (laughs derisively) What? I do. What are you looking at? Bitch. The news of an unexpected baby can have a powerful effect on people. I couldn't wait to share the good news with its daddy. Hey, this is Kenton. Leave me a message, maybe I'll call you back. If you're going to have a baby, you need to start wearing shoes around the house, brushing your teeth. I'm not going to be shacked up with some Jerry Springer contestant... "Babies Having Babies . Let's ask the audience what they think." Are you going to keep it (the baby)? Yeah, I want to. I mean, if mama lets me, that is. I'd like to. Was uncle Arno's any fun? Must be nice to travel... who's the baby's daddy? It doesn't matter. It might matter to mama. She'll want to make sure it's not like that one-legged Chinaman who mops up the... don't say "Chinaman," all right? Say "China-person." The dad's something special, Jay. Therefore, I figure this baby has at least half a chance of being something special, too, you know? She's not going to hit you. Mama's a screamer, not a fighter. Hey, baby. So, guess what. What? I gotta pee, honey. I gotta pee, hold on. Wait, wait. I'm going to go in and soak up the first wave. If Barbie comes out, just hit her or something. Okay? Mom? Run! Where the hell is she? I don't know. Rena! Rena, you better run! You and I are going to have a long talk about this tomorrow morning, missy. And you are damn lucky I'm too tired to fight with you anymore tonight. Can we still go and see daddy? Goddamn it, Rena! You think we're going to tell your daddy about this? Look, I just thought that... you thought? If you'd been thinking, Rena, you wouldn't be in this mess! Don't hurt yourself thinking, sweetie! Yeah, well, he might be happy, you know? Having a grandbaby and all. We won't know till we ask. I didn't use a stomach pump because your daughter is pregnant. We just had to force fluids in order to flush out those vitamins. Chewy-chews. Yeah. Well, lucky for you, children's vitamins are non-toxic. Do you have any idea why she took that many? I think she thought they were good for the baby. That's smart. Well, they are, aren't they? Yes, in moderation. I'm going to talk to her about cutting back on those. All right, you do that. Okay. 48, 49, 50. Yeah! Look at that. Ooh! Hey, your mama coming this year? No, she aint never coming. She in San Antonio with my sister and her kids. You can eat with us, then. I don't want to horn in on your family time, John. My daughter's coming. Hey, now, you never told me you had a daughter. How old? A couple years younger than the boy. Teenage-something. Teenage-something? Well, maybe I will. All right, I'll finish up work. You're looking good, John. One, two, three... delicioso. Yeah. Jay, we should bring those bottle rockets you been saving. Mama, it says no explosives of any kind right here. It does not say that. Mama, read it. It says it right there. That is just the stupidest thing I ever heard. Bottle rockets never hurt nobody. Actually, I saw uncle Arno blow up a cat's butt with a bottle rocket once. When are you kids going to stop telling tales about uncle Arno? "Uncle Arno tried to feel Rena up, "uncle Arno tried to slip me the tongue, uncle Arno is having sex with the neighbor's dog." I mean, Jesus! That one I saw. I like uncle Arno. One day you kids are not going to have me and uncle Arno to blame everything on. Mama, it says no whole chicken. What? Why not? I don't know, perhaps it's a vegetarian institute. Well, that's the stupidest thing I ever heard. We're taking it. All right. We're good. I'm running free  I'm falling down  I'm looking for a little direction  I'm walking tall  I'm looking fine  but feeling so far from perfection  hey, but that's okay  junior, can you do anything with this? I don't know. Honey, honey, honey... God, it looks like it's going to explode or something. Should we wake up Barbie? It's the radiator. Let's go over everything not to upset your daddy with, okay? All right, don't tell daddy I dropped out of high school again. Don't tell daddy that Jay junior lost his box boy job at the Kroger. Don't tell daddy about the two Koreans that moved in across the way. Tell daddy that I'm planning to go to beauty school. That'll be happy. Click your heels, Rena. Maybe the wizard will send us home. Maybe he'll grant me a brain so I have the good sense to stay home next time. Come on, you guys. Let's hurry. Jay: Don't ask daddy why he got passed up for parole again. Barbie: Don't tell daddy about that queer boy Jay used to run around with. And above all... Jay: Don't tell dad you're going to have a damn baby. Just remember that. Your dad's going to have a real nice day. Hi. All set, thanks. Hey. Hey. Good to see you again. Who, me? I haven't been here in... what is it, mama, three years? Yeah, about that. No, I swear you were just here last week. I must look like somebody on TV. No, I never forget a face. Damn, it's the chicken. I hope we don't get arrested. No whole poultry. Regulations. How come? The bones can be carved into weapons and such. With your permission, I'll send this over to the guards in the tower. Are we going to get our bowl back? See me on the way out. Hey, welcome back. Are we good? All right, let's go. Enjoy the picnic now. Thank you. You see them yet? Not yet. You sure they coming? I don't know. Mother: I want you to behave yourself. Make your father proud! We're Grubbs. You know what that means. What, we crawl on our bellies and eat the dead? Jay! Say "picnic." Stop wasting that film on those criminals. And could you smile, please? I don't feel like smiling. You'd better smile for your father, Goddamn it. Barbie, I don't want you flirting with those guards. This picnic only comes once a year. As long as we're here, we should try and make it nice for him. That man is your namesake. I don't care how many consecutive life terms he gets, he's always going to be your father. I want you to remember that. I don't think I'm going to be able to recognize daddy. You better hope he doesn't recognize that special glow of yours. There he is. There he is. John! I don't even look pregnant. Girls! Girls, girls, girls! Oh, yeah! Come on, baby! Come on! Ah, yeah! Daddy had some spell over mama. She was aware of it, but what could she do? She loved him. It's a thin line, I guess, between love and resentment. The important thing was we were a family once again. Jesus, you two, get a room. Hey there, Barbie girl. You're looking prettier than ever. Oh, yeah. Hey, daddy. Hey, boy. How's your boxing technique coming along? Come on. Maybe wrestling is more your style. Come here. Come on, boy, fight back. You don't want to look like a homo in front of your dad's prison pals now, do you? No, daddy, I don't want to look like a homo in front of all your prison pals. All right, just grab the blanket. I got us a spot over by that tree. Come on. Rena. You are getting so big. I'm not that big. She's just become womanly, Thats all. I meant she's just... yeah, I meant: she's getting pretty, you know? Radiant, even. She don't look that radiant. You're going to be fighting the boys off with a stick. Yes, you are. Just like your mama. Let's go over by the tree. Come on! Little late for a stick. Yeah. Look at that. You must be Jay junior. Your daddy saved you this spot. Spread that blanket out here. P.A: please be advised... due to today's picnic, library, gym, barber-shop will be closed. I see you met Buddy. Hey, this is Buddy, everybody. Hey, Buddy. I told you they would come. Well, come on. You look a little young to be a lifer. That's 'cause I aint. I'm a trustee. Yeah, he got himself three years for armed robbery. I'll be out by labor day. Good behavior. Good for you. Your mama must be proud. John: Well, come on, What did you bring us? John Junior made his casserole. It looked a lot better till mama put potato chips all over everything. Well, this looks good. Game time. Everybody come on over for the tug-o-war at the South end of the yard! Let's go get them! Come on! I'm looking for a win here. We're going to kill them, daddy! That's an unfortunate choice of words. I'm the biggest, so I'm going to anchor from the front. Jay, you fall in behind. Buddy, you get the ass end. All right, I got here. Go, you guys! Come on! Hi, y'all. We're the Grubbs. Yeah, Grubbs, Grubbs, Grubbs, Grubbs... mother: Go, go, go! Grubbs, Grubbs, Grubbs! Shit! It's all right. We'll get him some fresh clothes. You don't mind? No, go ahead. Thank you. You're welcome. Taking care of a little business, that is all. heard she went and left you like she left the one before  you thought it wouldn't happen if you loved a little more  you could've loved her endlessly  nothing would change  but now you'll have to figure why life is so strange  you know I been down that road  you gotta move on and let the cold wind blow  you get another chance, you get another ride  make the best of what you got and look on the bright side  it's wide open  anything you dream  is sure to set you free  wide open  anywhere you go  your love will always flow  I know you've been a friend through my bad times  I was dumped, left in the dust  you helped me keep my mind  but through it all, I fell for you  baby, how I fell for you  daddy! Bronze medal! Well, you showed them, Rena girl. You shouldn't be horsing around, Rena. You're going to hurt that damn baby. What? Oops. Is that true? Yes, sir. Well, that's the best news you could've brought your lifer daddy! I'm going to be a granddaddy! My little girl's going to have a baby! I knew you'd be happy, daddy. Mama said you wouldn't, but I knew that you would. What? Is that true? Yes, sir. I thought maybe... you thought? You thought? Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think somebody ought to knock you upside the head! Grubb! Junior, you sit still! She's going to be okay. I was just going to make sure that she... don't you talk back to your mama! Sit down! Just calm down. I can explain everything. I'm going to have some of that cake. Yeah, daddy, I made us a cake. You did? You'd never believe how hard it was to keep that file from sticking out the sides of the cake and everything. No, no, no, I was just joking. He stepped on the fucking potato chips! How many times have I told you not to make jokes about any motherfucking file in the cake? Why don't I take these kiddies on a tour of the facility? That's a great idea. Maybe we'll find your little sister. I'm not hungry anyway. What are you bawling for? You're distracting me. Just do your business and get out. Business is slicing my wrists open wide, so don't expect any privacy any time soon. You got any hemlock? What? Hemlock. The poison of Socrates. Effective and permanent. My name's Rena. That's an ugly name. What's yours? Hildegarde. Aren't you dead yet? No, I was just practicing. Practice makes perfect. Goddamn, Madge, what the hell's going on at home? I guess we've just gone wild with permissiveness during your absence, John. Well, Goddamn! Please, please don't be like this. The girl just made a mistake is all. So, what are you going to do about this? Honey, she's torturing herself enough as it is. She doesn't need me slapping at her. So who's the daddy? I don't know that she knows. Well, at least Rena's popular. Well, John, let us think for a moment about why that is. I think it might be that heavy boy from the wrestling team... Drugan or Drury... not red Dugan's kid. I think so. That whole family's never been worth a shit! Baby... no, no, no! You know, I know what you're trying to do, all right? How are you raising these kids? Just tell me that. What the fuck are you thinking? Well, John, it's easy for you, isn't it? You're sitting in here with your barbed wire and your three free squares a day and you get your bump-and-grind with all those big old strangers in the shower... Hey! That's one. Don't think that I don't know what kind of party goes on in here. That's two. I'll slap your ass! Why don't you just knock us all out and get it over with? Neither of them kids is going to turn out to be worth a damn. What, and that's all my fault? Yeah! I'm going to be having a baby. Really? Well, you look awful young. What's a little thing like you want with a baby? Because then there's always going to be somebody there who loves me. Just like I love my daddy in spite of any bad things or killings or whatever. Things is as they is. That's what mama says. Pardon the intrusion, ma'am. Is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, you any good with that gun? I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. Besides, in this family we do all our own killing. John. Baby, things are pretty good at home, actually. I mean, you know, Barbie, she's doing real, real good. Jay's not so bad. He looks so damn fruity. No. Uncle Arno, he taught him how to gut a rabbit. I've seen him spit sometimes. You know, I thought maybe Buddy would be a good boy for Rena. Yeah, it's long been a dream of mine to hook her up with one of the lesser felons around here. This here's the educational center. We got computer learning, and they even got a cooking class. Up there's where they keep the conjugal trailers at. Yeah, that's right. Mama told me about that one time. Right over there we got the gym. That's where the regular prisoners are at. And right over yonder we got maximum security. That's where all the dangerous inmates are kept. Like daddy? That's right, just like big Johnny Grubb. If I have a baby, it's going to love me in spite all my faults, just like I love daddy. Besides, the baby's daddy is nice and normal. I made sure of that. You could maybe try calling every once in a while. That certainly wouldn't kill you. What good am I? I'm in here. Well, John, you could start by saying something nice to Rena. Lord, she thinks the world of you. Don't ask me why. Hell, I don't know why, Madge. Hell, I don't know either, John. Is there a place around here where a girl could get a load off? They got the visitation center right up there. Where it's air conditioned and they got soda pop... I was, kind of, hoping we could finish the tour. I'm going to have to catch up to you, Barbie. Come on. Why don't you give me some of that cherry pie, huh? John, come on. John! There are people right over there. That's all right, they won't say anything. I'm serious, cut it out. Oh, man. Buddy: What do you say after this we get some hot dogs and fuck? What? You don't like hot dogs? Just a little prison humor for you. This here is the library. Folks come here and read. How do you get to wander all around like this? I'm a trustee. Trustees have master keys. Open up all the locks. Well, this is where old... there we go. This is where old Buddy works. The barber shop. Come on, let's go to the trailers. No, I think the kids are out here somewhere. There's no one around, let's go. Why not? I can't. Why? Baby, I got me a yeast thing going on. Really? No. Why don't you have a seat? Let old Buddy cut that mop of yours. No, we should probably be getting back. Well, you don't want to hurt my feelings now, do you? No, no, no. Nothing like that. Get in the fucking chair. Somebody got you trained right. Mel's only been in here about four months. Most days, I think I'm just going to die. I'm a young woman, after all, and he's not even going to be eligible for parole until he is a very old man. I can't get the hang of it, I just can't. Congratulations on your bronze. Thanks. Winning third place in the shackle race is just about the best thing that's ever happened to me, I guess. If that puts things in perspective for you. I'm going to make you look like a gentleman. You got a rat nest up in here. Whoo, that's a big piece. Look at that. Whoo! Come on. John, every time I come out of one of them damn trailers, I just feel like... I feel like that's it, you know? I feel like that's all I'm ever going to get. I tell you... you know, it's always hot, isn't it? I mean, while it lasts. Folks do with a lot worse, okay? You got no more idea what I'm talking about than the man in the moon, do you? Well, Goddamn! Goddamn it. I am here! I am stuck here and probably will remain here! What the hell do you want out of me? I don't know, John. Well, a man's liable to go looking. That's all I'm going to say. You're going to go looking? Where are you going to go looking, Johnny? Are you going to hit the singles bars? I wonder where those kids are at. Wow, that's pretty good. How about a shave? No, I don't think... so, what'd big Johnny Grubb do to earn himself two consecutive life terms? You don't know? Big John don't talk about it much. He killed a couple guys in a bar fight. Ho! They deserve it? I guess. Dad said they were faggots. We can't have too many of them now, can we? Going around decorating living rooms and gardening stuff. Nah uh-uh. Ooh, look at that. Yeah. Handsome gentleman and pretty. Now that's very impressive. Where'd you learn how to do that anyhow? We have a neighbor named Faye. She taught me how. You must have a lot of patience. And I believe with enough patience, we can accomplish just about anything. Yeah. You're absolutely right. We just have to have patience. We just gotta keep at it. Yeah, just... keep on. Yeah. Thanks a lot. You got a hair right there. Come on, let's go. Thought I'd find you here. So, what do you like folks to call you? Junior? Well, my name's John junior, but everybody just calls me Jay. Jay. Let me see that. So you don't forget me. There's not a lot of chance in that. Forgetting you. Good. I promise I won't. What do you say I go take you to see the show? What? Let's go see the show. It's what we do down here for fun. What are we doing? These are the conjugal trailers. What's "conjugal" mean? Fucking. What? These are the fucking trailers. I know what they are. I live in a fucking trailer. What is it? You don't want to see this. No, I want to see. Think you can handle it? All right. Do I think I can handle it? That's going to be a hell of a Kodak moment, huh? Come on, Jay. Are you going to be all right? Mama said all the pushing and shoving daddy did was just his way of teaching us right from wrong. And he never really hurt us. Maybe this little get-together was just too much for him after so many years. How you doing, sweetheart? I'm doing good. Just, you know, Butterflies, that is all. Baby, what happened here? Those cuffs in that shackle race, they were just too tight. I'm fine, though. You better put something on that when we get home. You seen your daddy anywhere? No. Is daddy happy that we came? Of course he is, baby. I don't know what he expects out of your brother, though. Maybe Barbie's somewhere putting some sense into him. Excuse me... sheriff? That's deputy, ma'am. My friends call me Richard. Okay. Richard, you wouldn't happen to know where that son of a bitch I married has gotten to, would you? I'm sure he's around here somewhere. These guys don't go nowhere unless we let them, you know? But I'd sure be happy to help you look for him. Okay. Okay. I'll be right back, sweetie. Let me help you up there. Thank you. I'll be right back. Hey, red. Oh, my God, you scared me. Not as much as I'm going to scare you. What do you mean? I think you know exactly what I mean. I'm going to go back to the picnic area now. Hey, you got any cigarettes? This here's my last one, and I have a heart murmur, so I need it, and I'm going to smoke it. It's a filthy habit anyway. You know, my silence can be bought very inexpensively. Well, I don't got any money, so... I don't want your money. No. I thought rather, I'd really like to hear you squeal like a piggy. Excuse me? Now, I know you've been to the movies a time or two. I'd like to hear you squeal like a piggy. I most definitely will not! Mrs. Grubb! You'll never guess who's fucking your... OK! Shit, fine. Oink, oink. Mrs. Grubb! All right! Fine. Let me help you out here. Real piggies would probably like some grass, so why don't you come over here and maybe get on all fours like a real piggy? What do you say? Come on now, I want to hear you... ree! Come on now, on all fours like a real piggy. Yeah, come on, come on now. Could be worse, you could be in the mud. You don't want to be in mud. Nice soft grass. Yeah, that's right, good little piggy. Come on. That's right, that's right. (snorts like a pig) All right, come on, more, I want more! Yeah! That's right! Yeah! Come on, like a pig! I want to hear you reee! That's real nice. That's real nice. Come on, everybody. That's all, folks. Yeah! Today's annual picnic will be concluded at 4:00. All visitors will need to begin lining up at the gate at 3:30 with all belongings. Commanding Officer Jones, report to the visitors tent. Commanding officer Jones, please report to the visitors tent. Hey, daddy. Where's your mama? She went off looking for you. Give me a sandwich, would you? I'm really glad that we came here, daddy. I knew seeing you again would be really nice. Yeah. You're getting' to be quite a gal, Rena. You know... your mama loves you. Remember that... you know, when she's a bitch and all... that she loves you. I know. Hey, here. Thanks for all those postcards you've been sending. I like them. I don't mind that there's no pictures on them. You know, Kenton likes football, so you'd like him. He's a lot like... you know, I still have those books that you read to me when I was younger... hey, look. Shovel pass! They're under my bed. Sometimes, you know... Kenton would really like you. I'm, like, tired and I get them out and I just remember how you used to read to me until I fell asleep... Bomb! Here we go! Come on! Hey, what's up with this damn baby? Go long! Go long! Well, I kind of, wanted to name it after you, daddy. John Grubb the third. When your last name's Grubb, You, kind of, have to be careful what you put before it. Nice catch, jerk-off! I was kind of thinking that Russell Upsome might be a nice name. Mm-hmm. Sidearm! Russell Upsome Grubb. What do you think, daddy? Sure thing, baby-doll. Oh, yeah. You got any advice, daddy? Yeah, go long! Long! Don't worry. I'll write a special suicide note explaining the whole thing out for you. Hey, you're not that far along. So I gave your mama the name of a guy who can take care of this for you. Thanks, daddy. Sure thing. I mean, a daddy takes care of his little girl, don't he? All right, hit me! Come on! Hit me, I'm open. That part, you know, that's not really so bad, but... I mean, yeah, if John wasn't stuck here, I would absolutely take my kids and I'd leave. And where would you go to? Hey, I thought, alcohol wasn't allowed. It's not. Where? Anywhere? Don't laugh. Well, I was thinking maybe I'd take the kids and move to Disney World. Ah, the happiest place on earth. Yeah, well, that's what they say. Yeah. I mean, not in the actual park itself... of course not. Maybe somewhere close by. So what's stopping you? John would just about snap my neck if we left. Not with two consecutive lifetimes, he won't. Well, yeah, but I've got him pretty pissed off, missing all those conjugals. What you talking about? All those conjugal visits, you know. Well, I know what they are, Madge. It's just, I've never known John to miss one. In fact, Johnny Grubb's been getting all of his conjugal visits. But you knew that. Madge... we're all fuckered up here. You don't belong in this place. I think there's probably a better life for you out there somewhere. By God, you ought to go find it. I want to thank you for, you know... mama, hey! You want to be my partner for the egg toss? Sounds like a waste of eggs, Barbie. Nice haircut. I won't tell mom. Get up and you fight me like a man, you son of a bitch! What's wrong with you, Madge? You son of a bitch, you horn-dog! I know all about you! I know all about you and your conjugal floozy! Your mama sure is pissed. Yeah, she's usually a screamer, not a fighter. How about you? Are you a fighter? No, I'm more of a lover. Life sure is worth living, Aint it? You take care now, Jay. Why don't you tell your kids that you been cheating on their mama? I'm going to have to drop you. Where the hell did you meet her? Come on, now. Where the hell did you meet her? Is she some bull dyke from the women's prison? Or is she some pen pal, some desperate whore you... mother: Baby, baby, are you okay? Could somebody get somebody? She's been in there a long time. Hope she's all right. She'll be okay. She just got the wind knocked out of her. They don't make them any tougher than Rena, I'll tell you that. It's that motherfucking guard's fault. That motherfucking guard set me up. He just wanted to get some of that cherry pie. John, shut up. He's jealous. Who can blame him? Yeah, he's after you. You're looking good. Come on, let's get out of here. John, we can't. Yeah, we can. Come on, let's go. No, we're already in trouble. I'm doing double life. What's some more trouble? Stop! Okay. Follow me. God. I'm sorry. God! I'm sorry... well, hello there. What are you looking at? Trashy little harlot doesn't know how to treat her mama? Just a guess. Fuck you. Why don't you sit there until I tell you to... guess what! I don't happen to be a prisoner here! What the fuck? What the fuck did you just do to yourself, Rena? Nothing... you're not leaving me here alone, Goddamn you! Give me that! Just sit down! Hold this up! If you want to die, you sure picked one hell of a shoving-off place. I'm sorry. Why? None of this is your fault. Why don't you let me go, Jay? 'Cause you're my sister. Hell, I don't even want to see Barbie dead most days. You love me because you have to. I'm your sister and you have to. I don't have to. You don't love daddy, do you, Jay? No. Why not? He's your daddy, just like I'm your sister. I haven't done anything for you to just give me your love. Yeah, well, you never tried to shit on it, either. Somebody gives you their love, you should try not to shit on it, I guess. I should write that down. Maybe you should embroider it on something. You know what else? What else? This shit gets better. I promise. What do you say I go get mom and we get the fuck out of here? Okay? Yeah, that sounds like a plan. Hold that on there tightly. I'll be back. What, Madge? What? No, Same as always, John. Same as always? It don't matter. Wait a minute, baby. What's the matter? John, I'm taking the kids. We're moving to Disney world. Fuck that! Hey, hey! Madge! Fuck that shit! You can't do that. Why not? 'Cause nobody lives at Disney Land. We're going to. And I said Disney World. You never did listen to me. Orlando? Are you, fucking, nuts? What about your job? You mean jobs, John. You know, it takes money to keep these kids in clothes and food and slurpees and pay the bills and do all the shit that a real family does. But don't you worry about us. I can find myself a mind-numbing, low-paying job anywhere I go. You are so stupid. All you had to do was be nice to us for one day, John. Just pretend for one day, and you couldn't even do that. All right, babe. I gotta take a piss. I'll catch up with you later. Okay? Fucking bitch. Hey, Rena. Hey, daddy. You're looking... you're looking special. That's my girl, looking special. Your dad's very proud of you. You know that, don't you? I haven't done anything to make nobody proud, daddy. Yes, you have. You won that silver medal out there. It was bronze. Whatever. Daddy, I lost it. We'll go out there and find it, baby. No, not the medal. I lost the baby. Well... there you go. See there? Nobody can say that my little girl can't take care of herself. It's not so hard to make your daddy proud, right? How's mama doing? Well, you know your mama. Some people just aint worth shooting. Now's a fine time for you to figure that out. What was that? Nothing, daddy. I'll tell you what. You better look at me when I talk to you. You and your brother better learn some respect for me, or I'm going to teach you some respect with the back of my hand, you got that? You know what, daddy? I'm not afraid of you. What? I said I'm not afraid of you. Come here, I'm going to teach you... hey! Outside, Grubb! OK, Grubb, let's go. Outside. You look like shit. You know, if you could just find it inside of you to be nice to me just for once, now would be a really good time to do that. Sorry. You're so lucky. Yeah, I'm really lucky, all right. Do you remember your daddy? I met him once when I was little. Were you upset when he died? A little. No. No, not really. So I guess now you don't expect nothing. Well, nothings exactly what I got. Nobody expects nothing of you on account of that heart murmur. Yeah, it's really great to be me, all right. It's just one big old fucking jamboree. Here. Let's get the fuck out of here. Yeah. Thanks. There you are. Where have you been? Let's get the hell out of here and go home. Barbie: Don't have to tell us more than once. Sir... could you shoot us? Please? Seriously. We tried. I don't know, John. There's some changes coming. Goddamn, a man should be... just kiss me good-bye. Try not to wreck my last raw nerve. Bye, daddy. Hey, Rena. You come and see your daddy real soon. Okay, Rena? Yeah, I'll keep looking for those postcards you send. Why do you keep talking about postcards? What's up with that? I know it's not much, but at least you make an attempt. Honey, I'm so sorry. I've been having Faye mail them from the flea market. I'm sorry. Well, hey, whatever. I just want to say, you know, congratulations. For what? For getting your, you know... congratulations is not... you know, daddy, I don't really think that you should say that. Don't get all weepy on me now. Come on. Think of it this way, okay? Things aint all that bad. I mean, it didn't cost you nothing. Goddamn! Get her off! Get her off me! You're lucky I don't have a gun! She went fucking ballistic on me! Motherfucker! Let me go! Just fuck it. Don't even sweat it. Dad's a dick. He wasn't always, Jay. Yeah, Rena, he was. Daddy's always been a dick. Then it just must be this fucking place. I don't know what they did to him, but he used to read me stupid nursery rhymes. "Slippery, slippery Sam, he sat upon a ham." Aw, for chr... what?! She spilled the damn drink on me, for Christ's... what the fuck? Get up! Get up! Shit! Shit! You gotta stop being so damn dense and knock some sense into that girl. Dense? Let me tell you something, John. Being stupid is something I intend to overcome, but you are stuck here being mean for a lifetime. That's me. Mean and nasty. If there is a God in heaven, I hope that you are corn-holed by the meanest, nastiest... no, no, no. I hope you are corn-holed by Satan himself. Maybe then you'll understand just a fraction of the pain you have put us through. In your dreams, Madge. In your dreams. You'll be back! You can't get enough of big John Grubb! You need the Grubb worm! I'll see you next month, baby! It went better than it could have. No shit, ace. I've been thinking. Just because we was born and raised here, we don't have to die here. I think we should move. Where to? Orlando. It's where they keep Mickey Mouse at, I believe. Madge Grubb, you've just had the living dog shit kicked out of you at a state penitentiary... what are you going to do next? I'm going to Disney World! You guys are fucked up. Perhaps. In the best way possible. Good night, baby. Good night. Baby, you just wanted a daddy so bad that I thought if I could somehow... hey, now I know. I get it. It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Come here. Addendum to an abandoned suicide note... it's clear that whatever we're to become as a family, we'd be doing it without big John Grubb. And Jay applied to this fancy culinary institute up in the bay area. So yeah, I guess sissy boy's leaving us. Regardless, I know he's always going to love me, even though he doesn't have to. And Barbie landed herself a job gluing on fake fingernails and doing manicures at a salon outside of phoenix. She's doing just fine for herself, despite that debilitating heart murmur. Right, right. Write me, too. Come on, kids, let's go. Shotgun! Jay: No! hey, child, why you look so sad tonight?  did your castle wash away your only ray of hope...  we stopped by Kenton's so I could tell him that we were going to have a baby, but it died in prison. Kenton was a real dick about it, having never lost anything he loved, so I put his car in neutral and rolled it into the pool. So now he can relate. Get back here, you fucking bitch! my baby  my baby  my little girl almost died tonight  bye, bye, sweet angel  bye, bye, my love  if we ride all the rides  if we stand by each other's side  as for me, I've stopped looking for exit ramps. I'm just going to stay on the road, see where it takes me. I learned you tend to remember only what you want in this life. And as far as that picnic goes, I only remember leaving. angel following the stars  in a '74 pinto with a broken belt  driving all the way to Mars  oh, my baby  my little girl almost died tonight  bye, bye, sweet angel  bye, bye, my love  if we ride all the rides  if we stand by each other's side  my sweet angel, good night  you got so many dreams inside  you're scared that if you think  your bus will pass you by  you don't know where the rainbow starts for you  one day soon, the clouds will clear  and a smile will replace your tears  suddenly you'll see the open road  you're going to see the open road, baby  bye, bye, sweet angel  bye, bye, my love  if we ride all the rides  if we stand by each other's side  my sweet angel, good night  sun's shining  the candle's burned low  driving through the desert round midnight  don't know where you're going  angel following the stars  in a '74 pinto with a broken belt  driving all the way to Mars  oh, my baby  my little girl almost died tonight  bye, bye, sweet angel  bye, bye, my love  if we ride all the rides  if we stand by each other's side  my sweet angel, good night  you got so many dreams inside  you're scared that if you think  your bus will pass you by  you don't know where the rainbow starts for you  but one day soon, the clouds will clear  and a smile will replace your tears  suddenly you'll see the open road  you're going to see the open road, baby  bye, bye, sweet angel  bye, bye, my love  if we ride all the rides  if we stand by each other's side  my sweet angel, good night  sun's shining  the candle's burning low  driving through the desert round midnight  you don't know where you're going  angel following the stars  in a '74 pinto with a broken belt  driving all the way to Mars  oh, my baby  my little girl almost died tonight  bye, bye, sweet angel  bye, bye, my love  if we ride all the rides  if we stand by each other's side  my sweet angel, good night  you got so many dreams inside  scared that if you think your bus will pass you by  don't know where the rainbow starts for you  one day soon the clouds will clear...
