It's a disgusting habit. There were two of us who witnessed it. It's your word against ours. Come on... Beth. You're so agitated. You're not really going to arrest me, are you? I am. Excuse me. Yes? - Can you tell me your name, please? - I can't help you, sir. Look, I'm not a criminal, all right? I'm just going through a lot of hard shit right now. It's Janice. It's very nice to meet you, Janice. I only ask because when I tell this story, I'm gonna want to know which one was the mean-ass flight attendant and which one has the kind blue eyes. Mm... I have to get back to work. Can you help me out, please? There's nothing I can do. Look, I'm an addict. Isn't it bad enough that I'm gonna die from this shit someday? If I could help you, I would, but I can't. My father's dying. He's in the hospital right now, and I'm flying back to be with him. There's nothing more that I'd rather do than avoid it, but I can't. And I know that this sounds incredibly absurd, but you gotta believe me. I mean, who would lie about something like this? If your father's not dying, you're going to hell. My father is dying, and I'm already in hell. He's been dying for years. He's gotten good at it. Doesn't mean I want to watch. I'm not gonna spend my life in some fucking hospital, these lights, that smell. What am I even doing here? Home, sweet home. Fuck. You are CEO of Stone fucking Andrews. How is this not up to you? Look, Wyatt, I have to do - what's best for the bank. - Mr. Coleman, we all know that Frank's gonna foreclose on you, so this would all be a lot easier if you stopped posturing. There isn't a bank in this city that would foreclose on me. I don't need your favors. Let's go. - I'm sorry, Robert. - Steven, sit down. Wyatt, please. We all have a lot at stake here, gentlemen, but I think I have a scenario in which we all can be winners. Wyatt, you're going to sell the portfolio - to Steven at his price. - But... Just... Steven, you're going to cut the Coleman group in for 20%, because nobody can manage these assets like they can. - Robert... - Let me finish, will you? Frank, Stone Andrews is gonna write down the paper by 40%. It's overvalued, anyway. You know that. The three of us are gonna form a new entity, which I will run, and this entity will build upon these assets and others which we all will contribute, and we'll use them as a foundation to buy, with a focus on true value, every distressed piece of real estate in Manhattan. Now, I would assume that Stone Andrews would be interested in dealing with a company like ours, so I'm going to give you first crack at the lead position for our debt financing. Gentlemen, do we have an understanding? Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Thank you, Robert. I apologize for any misunderstanding. Then we have a deal. Now, if you will excuse me, I'm taking my son to lunch. Look at you. Is that my tie? Excuse me. Jesus. What the hell you think you doing? Shit. Sorry. You know what? Out. Out! Look, it's out, all right? Look... Carrie, would you calm down? I'm just trying to get upstairs. No, you're not going upstairs. This motherfucker come walking in my hospital, acting like it's a smoking section or some shit. You got a lot of nerve. Jesus, my dad's dying in there, all right? Hope you're happy. I'm very disappointed in you, Carrie. Jonathan? How long you been here? I don't know. Well, when's the last time you were home? I said I don't know. A day, two days, a week. Does it matter? Mom, he's gonna be okay. Relax. Not this time. This time, it's different. What do you mean? Maybe he didn't know what he was saying. What was he saying? He had an episode. He was under a lot of stress. And? Have you been smoking? No. Tell me you're not that stupid. Mom... You have, haven't you? I want you to wash up. I don't want him smelling you. Hey, Dad. Hey. Still smoking, huh? Nah. Just taxi guy was... Sometimes I still miss the smell. Robert... Well, I do. I just don't want this for you. I know. I don't either. So we gonna take you home? Maybe go to the beach for the weekend? Not this time. I'm done, buddy. What do you mean, done? My body's ruined, and I won't let your mom suffer through this anymore. I am not suffering. Look at me, Robert. You're having a tough couple of days. - Not that at all. - That's all. - You're confused. - I'm not confused. No, I'm confused. What's going on? You're not leaving us, Robert. I'll never leave you. It's just time. Don't say that. What are you talking about? It's surgery twice a day for one, maybe two hours' consciousness. It's not worth it. Oh, yes, it is, God damn it. You know, I don't complain about the pain, but it's so bad, sometimes I can't even see straight. And when I'm on morphine, I'm just lost. So you gotta fight. Fought for 12 years. I got nothing. Let's just wait and see how you feel tomorrow. We all knew this day was coming. So you're quitting? You're just fucking quitting? Tomorrow morning, they're taking me off the machines. I'm off my medication now... because I want to... I want to look at you all with clear eyes one last time. You can't do this. Karen's not even here. Her train got in half-hour ago. Great. We can all do this together. Together? You made me fly back here to watch you die? That's what this is? - This is not about you. - Bullshit, it's not! You can't handle what I do! I'm not here sucking up to you, so this is what you do? I want no part of it. You want to kill yourself, do it without me! Fuck you! Fuck! Hello? Are you all right? I said are you all right up there? I'm gonna call for help. I'm fine. I don't need any help, all right? Well, you don't sound fine. It's okay. I'm human. I just don't have any hair. You sure you're okay? Sometimes I come up here and scream, too. Feel any better? Do you feel any better? Like, did the screaming help? Yeah, it helped. Well, sometimes I find that it doesn't help at all. I think it helped. What was it? Nothing. What were you screaming about? Nothing. Whatever. You don't have to tell me. I'm just some stupid kid. Probably wouldn't understand anyway, right? I didn't say that. You didn't really say anything. Doesn't appear to be your strong suit. Are you sick? No. What are you doing here? Is your wife sick? I'm not married. Don't get mad at me. It's not like you're not old enough. So... What? Why are you here? My dad. How long has he got? 24 hours. He's offing himself. Okay, that's pretty cool. You got a light? Are you fucking kidding me? What? Am I gonna get cancer? Have you got a light or not? Are you even old enough to smoke? Am I old enough to die? Oh, I knew you were packing. That one works every time. So I take it it's not from smoking. No, it's bone cancer. I don't get it. Where does cancer come from, anyways? Nobody fucking knows. Yeah, it's fucked. Those kids down there are, like, so young, it's depressing. They're young? What about you? Shouldn't you be on your way to homecoming or something? Prom, Einstein. Homecoming is in the fall. But I doubt I'll be around that long. I like to pretend it's a next form of human evolution. We're evolved. We're the only ones who can see life for what it truly is. What is it? Shouldn't you be with your dad or something? Said he's got 24 hours, right? Yeah. What's your problem? I don't know. If you think he wants to die, you're wrong, and if says he's not afraid, then he's lying. So, I'm Meredith. I'm 17, and I'm on the 22nd floor if you want your lighter back. See you later, alligator. Once the pressure equalizes in the center of a bubble, the strongest thing exerting force on it is the weight of the universe pushing down equally. Follow those points out... Hey. Hey. Uh... I thought you'd be halfway to Kennedy by now. What, and miss the party? - Hey, Jonathan. - Well, well, I'm really glad you're here. He could be a witness. Yeah, that'll be fine. Jonathan, I need you to witness your father making his last wishes and statement. And keep in mind that... you may be called to testify in court that he was of sound mind when he made the statement. Well, I don't know. Dad, are you of sound mind? Yeah, you know I am. Who started game seven for the Yanks, 2003 ALCS? Clemens. What happened bottom of the eighth? Grady. Grady listened to Pedro and left him in too long. He juiced the bases, and Posada doubled to tie it up. Who came on to relieve? - Wakefield. - Yeah. Then what happened? Aaron fucking Boone is what happened. Aaron fucking Boone. And we never made it, 'cause... Your sister tripped going through the turnstile and split her chin. I'll never forgive her for that. Me either. There you have it, Doc. Can we say tomorrow, 8 A.M.? I need you to say it. Oh. I w... want to be unhooked from these machines at 8 A.M. tomorrow. This is my wish, and I am of sound mind. Ryan Hu is only 12, and she's already played with the Philharmonic. You're 14. Well, Ryan Hu looks like a shih tzu. Kids, can you come down here for a minute? What happened? Your daddy has something he needs to tell you. Are you guys getting a divorce? No. No, honey, never, no. No. Your father is very sick. With what? I have cancer. It's not a big deal, though. You're not gonna die, right? Are you gonna die? I don't know. But I... promise you, sweetheart, I will do everything I can not to. The doctor gave me six months. Shh. Okay. John. John, do you have any questions? Do I still have to play violin? Well, that's something you're gonna have to decide for yourself. Okay. Jonathan... you all right? Jonathan, are you all right? Yeah. Talk to me, son. This is it. It's not fair. What? I don't know how to do this. We just talk. What do you want me to say? I'm not ready. This wasn't how it was supposed to end. How was it supposed to end? I don't know. I'd... I'd have it all figured out, you know. I'd have my shit together. I'd be able to come back here and just maybe... Forgive me? Forgive you for what? Well... I don't know. Whatever it is that you've been mad at me for. Getting sick? Dying? Hey... how's the music? I'm not really doing the music thing anymore. Oh. Why? What are you doing? How are you living? I sort of wanted to talk to you about that. I mean, right now, it's not the right time, but I could sort of... Hey, sweetheart. Hi, Daddy. Wow, look at you. Did you just come from court? Not exactly. Hi. Hey. You give your dad a hug? I really missed you, Daddy. Missed you, too, sweetheart. I can't let you do this. Karen, I love you. I love all of you, but it's my decision. I hear you, but you're just not thinking right. The drugs are clouding your judgment. He's thinking as clearly as he ever does. How do you know what he thinks like? I'm surprised you remember what he looks like. - Was his name on the door? - Oh, that's cute. Did you learn that in law school, little playground put-downs? You can't just waltz back in here, Jonathan, and start acting like you care. Well, I'm not acting like anything, Karen. - I'm just saying... - You don't have a say. You gave up that right when you walked out on us. Would you two just stop? Yeah. Why don't you talk to him for a second before you declare him incapable of making his own decisions? So just let him die? - Oh. Just... - Is that what you're saying? It is, isn't it? You just can't wait to get your hands on your inheritance, can you? You just came for your money. I didn't need to come for the money, Karen. I get it every fucking month in a blue envelope like you do. I don't need his money. I make my own. Please. Your fucking salary wouldn't pay for those shoes, let alone that stupid briefcase. The shoes were on sale, and the briefcase was a gift. - Hah! - Hey, hey. Okay, you done? Yeah. Are we done? Yeah. Sorry. No, no, it's okay. It was kind of nice. It's like being at home. I need to... I need to tell you something. The money... is gone. What? You heard me. I gave it away. What do you mean, gone? Your mother gets the house and what's left of the trust and the dividend on my life insurance policy. Everything else, gave it away. What do you mean, you gave it away? There are people who need it. You don't need my money. You just said so. Why are you doing this, Daddy? 'Cause I love you both... and I raised a couple of spoiled brats. I filed an injunction this morning. What? It's a preemptive measure intended to prevent Dr. Crier from performing any form of assisted suicide. She didn't have anything to do with this. God. What's so funny? Nothing. Fuck. I need a cigarette. Unbelievable. Your kids, man. Ho! Hey, hey. Illusion. Yay. Hat tricks. How 'bout some hat tricks? Here we go. Hat tricks. Hup! Hup! Ho! Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Duck. Oh! Oh! Whoa ho ho ho ho! Whoa! You're not funny. Anybody gonna laugh? Ha. Oh, you're too generous. - You're too generous. - Can I help you? Yeah. I'm looking for Meredith. Are you a relative? No. She has, uh... She has something of mine. Are you her boyfriend? No. Why not? Because I have a girlfriend back home. I don't believe you. Okay. What's your girlfriend's name? Uh, I think Meredith just got out of radiation. She should be back in her room, A-2112. I'm gonna go find her. Thanks. Have fun! Okay, you. Come on. It's time to go. Hey! Hey. Hey, you. Came to get my lighter. You look like shit. I do? Yes. Okay. What happened? My sister filed some injunction thing that's gonna keep my dad from killing himself. Then we just found out he gave away all our money. Really? Yeah. Your dad is such a badass. It's a little fucked up. Why? Because he gave away all our money. You had plans for it? Yeah. What? It doesn't matter. Whatever. Nothing. You wanted to do nothing. Look, I don't just sit around, all right? I have things I want to do. You need his money to do that? I really just came for my lighter, okay? Thanks. I'm sure it's rough for you out there. You're not the only one with problems. My problems aren't of the trust-fund variety. They're terminal. Please close the door when you leave. Look, I wanted to record an album, all right? And you're right. Maybe I didn't need his money, but it would have been nice, so... have a great day. Jonathan? Emily. Hi. Almost didn't recognize you. You look great. What are you doing here? I live here. I mean, we live here. I heard. Congratulations. Thank you. Um, what about you? What are you... - I was just walking. - Oh. Got in this morning, so seeing Dad. Oh, how is he? Is he all right? Not really. He, uh... They want to take him off life support tomorrow, so... I'm sorry. I didn't... It's okay. I mean, it's time. No, it's really terrible. I didn't, you know... I tried to call you a while back. Guess you changed your number. No. Yeah, I lost my cellphone and all my contacts. You know how it is. Yeah, I guess I do. Well, it's been really... wow... really nice running into you. Yeah, small world. Please give my best to your dad? I always loved him. They all do. All right. Take care. Emily! Emily! - Can I ta... - What? - Can I talk to you for a second? - I really... I really need to... Why did you leave? It was a long time ago, Jonathan. It's the only thing in my life that meant anything. Please. I need to know. I just never got to you. What do you mean? Heh. I mean, you give so much at the start. You have all of this charm and energy, and you're funny. You show all of this stuff, and then that's all there is. There's no there there. You don't let anybody in. Into what? - Into your heart. - Oh, come on, Em. - That's a clich. - No, it's not. Yeah, it is! There's no "into my heart"! There's no place in my heart. There's no door to my heart. The heart's muscle. It pumps blood. That's all it does. Then I was right... and that's too bad. So... So, uh... how long has it been since you've seen your sister? I don't know. Before she left for Yale. That was two years ago. Yeah, well, it's not like she made a big effort either. Well, she's been here. Of course. It's because you... It's because you love her more. Oh, that's not tr... That's not true. I'm not guilting you, Dad. It's a fact. It's like that in every family. I don't care. It's not true. I never loved your sister more. It's just that she loved me back. Yeah, well, it's hard to love someone who's got an expiration date stamped on their forehead. I didn't mean that. No, it's okay. It must have been hard for you. How you feeling, baby? About half as good as I look. Well, you look good. Good. Yeah. Got some color in your cheeks. Color? Eh, it's 'cause I stopped taking my medications. Don't you think we should rethink this, based on everything that's happened? Based on what, the rosiness of my cheeks? Look at me! - Dad! - Look at me! Stop. I don't want to do this anymore. Just stop. I want you to... I want you to make a phone call for me. I want to say good bye to some people. Ira has already made some calls, but I want... I want you to call Allen. Your brother Allen? Why? I wouldn't have the faintest clue how to get ahold of him. He's in Teaneck. He's fucking listed. I want you to call him and tell him it's now or never, tomorrow, I'll be dead. Ease up, Dad. Oh, look at this. Sticking up for his mother. Isn't that nice? I liked you better on painkillers. Yeah, seriously. Where are they? I'll fucking give him some. The hell you will. Well, chill the hell out, all right? This is hard enough. You know, it is Passover, two days... Dad, no... Why don't you pretend that I didn't waste my money on Hebrew school and organize a Seder, huh? - Just humor me. - You're unbelievable. You can act like you're not a Jew after I'm dead. I asked nicely. Yeah, you did, but this ain't no damn Kinko's, okay? Miss Fancy Pants want an award for asking nicely. You realize I can hear you, right? What are you doing? I'm waiting for a fax. No, you're not. Now, how the hell I know you two were together? A couple of spoiled-ass peas in a pod. Bitch. Where are you going? Dad wants to have a Seder. Well, Passover is not till next week. He can just wait. How 'bout that? I can't let him do this. You know that, right? What the fuck is taking them so long? When did this all become your decision? Should I just let him kill himself? Have you even looked at him, Karen? He's not living. There's nothing left of him. You're in a hurry to get back, aren't you? You hate it here, can't stand to be around us. You are out of your mind. Honestly, just go. We've done fine without you, really. Oh, you're just like Mom, aren't you? Got it all under control. Apparently I do. You're ridiculous. Dick. Where's Dr. Crier? Sorry. I haven't seen him. You can't stop him from dying. Jonathan, I don't know if you remember me. I'm Ira Stein, your father's accountant. Yeah. You're the one that talked my dad into giving his money away. I'm-Jonathan, I'm so sorry. We got here as fast as we could. Do you remember your cousins? Elizabeth, Rachel, Sarah. Will this shift never end? Hey. It's Ethan, your cousin. - Our dads are brothers. - Sorry, man. - How are you? - Hey. - This is my fiance Brooke. - A pleasure to meet you. I'm so sorry to meet under such awful circumstances. Nice to meet you. Who are those people? They're our friends. Your family. How do they know who I am? I've never fucking met 'em before. They watched you get circumcised. Dad. They saw you play baseball. They're part of my legacy and part of yours, so don't throw that away. Dad! What's going on? Mom? I'll get the nurse. What? It's all right. It's okay. Okay. Jonathan! I shouldn't be here. I can't do this. Nonsense. No, you're a fighter. I love that about you. Bring in my friends. Ethan, y-you're here. Of course I'm here. Well, no, I never would have let you come. How's Oxford? It's amazing. Who is... Is this Brooke? This is my fiance Brooke. Oh, wow. Look at you. When's the big day? It's June first, two days after I'm sworn in. I'm so proud of you. Wish I could be there. Me, too. You've done so much for me. I don't know how to thank you. Ah, you already have, son. Listen, have you spoken to your father? Oh, I called, but he... Yeah, we... we have, too. Listen, if I don't get a chance, would you... would you tell him that I love him, I never stopped? Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah. You take good care of him for me, will you? - I will. - I know. You've really outdone yourself. You know, your schooling was my gift, but find time for happiness, because the only gifts that last are memories. Yeah. I love you. I love you. Next! You're a most generous man. May God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Is that everybody? I hope so. Unless you want to throw some more money away. Where's Rabbi Moskowitz? - Starbucks. - What?! Why is all of these people here? Look, you other friends got to go. They are disturbing the rest of my damn floor. Well, Carrie, why don't we just take it down, all right? You ain't running shit up in here. Like I said, they got to go. Visiting hours are over. They gotta go. Guapo, talking about "take it down." No, your pretty ass better take it down before I smack that handsome off your damn face. I mean, come on. Knock that shit off. Jesus. You might want to stop talking to me, and y'all might want to take y'all ass home. - Seriously? - Love the compassion, Carrie. You can take that damn jacket off. Keep talking, okay? Keep on. What the hell does "guapo" mean? And who the hell is she talking to? I mean, what the fuck? Mom! Said, "Fuck"? I did. I said, "Fuck." I'll let you rest. I'll go start setting up. Say it again. You know, even when you were eight, I thought you'd make a great attorney. 'Cause every time I tried to punish your brother, you'd bang on the door and scream and holler and beg me not to spank him. I was ignorant. Well, it worked. He never got spanked. So it's my fault he's this way? No, no. It's mine. I should have used a belt. You can both go fuck yourselves. Rach? Hey. You all right? I've been in and out of this hospital for months. First time anyone's asked me how I'm doing. Sorry. I know. I'm just the caretaker. But what happens when he's gone? What happens when there's no more us? Who am I then? You even care? Of course we care. This is hard on all of us. You weren't married to him for 35 years. He was our dad, though! Whoa. "Was"? Don't put me in the ground so soon, buddy. Seriously? Kidding. And you... we're married. We took a vow of equality, and yet you choose to exclude me from the financial decisions? What am I gonna do? How am I... You're going to go on. You're going to find someone else. I don't want someone else! I can't even imagine it! I know, but you're gonna have to, because I can't take you with me, and I won't have you living with a ghost. How can you be so ignorant? Don't you Know I would gladly take your place? - I know that. - What is wrong with you? Mom, stop! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Eh, it's all right. It's really all right. Hey. I'm Meredith. I met your son in the stairwell. I'm dying, too. Ah. Well, nice to meet you. Am I interrupting? No, not at all. You Jewish? - I'll pour you some Manischewitz. - I am Jewish, actually. Great. Whoa, whoa. How old are you? 17. How old are you? Well, there are certain privileges you allow someone who is suffering, and I am one of those someones. Look, I think it's best if we all just lubricate our feelings, and we'll just get through this. Should you really be drinking that? Fine, whatever. I'm not Jewish. I just came to see if you'd play the kids some songs. Should we get started? David, our magician guy, apparently had a nervous breakdown. What? He lost the rabbit in the hat? Something like that. Look, I'm sorry. I can't, all right? Karen, will you sit down? Can't you just play them a few songs? Look, we're in the middle of something. What kind of... What kind of cancer do you have? Advanced bone marrow. - Wow. - Yeah. Pretty much given up on me. They're gonna send me home. Think they just want my room or something. Is he always this selfish? Yeah. Mom, will you read this? Why won't you play them a few songs? Yeah, there's no hurry. We have all night. No, I want to do it now. I got all the stuff. It'll keep. I don't see what the big deal is. Me neither. I don't even have a guitar. When are you gonna play something? I gotta tune it first. We don't care if it's out of tune. Well, I do. Do you know any rap? No. Do you know Miley? Miley Cyrus? No. Do you know Bieber? Do I look like I know Bieber? What about Taylor Swift? Am I really that old? You are kind of old. No, he isn't. How old are you? 30? That's pretty old. None of us are ever gonna be 26. Look, you don't know that, all right? They told my dad that he's got six months to live. He's been around for 12 years. But we're gonna die before we have sex. You're not allowed to say that! If it's true, you can say it. What? What are you looking at me for? What's it like? No, we're not having this conversation, all right? You kids are much too young. Old enough to die, old enough to... Enough! I can feel the devil on my shoulder And suddenly my world is upside down The cold inside my heart It just gets colder Try to move my feet But there's no ground You saved me once Please save me once again I swear this time My life is in your hands Angels in the sky I need your love Angels in the sky I need your love - Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! You saved me once Please save me once again I swear this time My life is in your hands Angels in the sky, I need your love Angels in the sky, I need your love You saved me once Please save me once again I swear this time My life is in your hands Angels in the sky, I need your love Yeah Angels in the sky I need your love Thanks for coming out! That was great! Excuse me. Great job! Dude, that was great! Hey. So what'd you think? You were great! You were just great! You were great. It was great. Your voi... Your voice sounded a little strained, you know, just like you were out of breath. Ah, they fucking loved me, huh? Yeah, well, I wouldn't get carried away with these people. They're full of shit. So how did... How did you think you did? What do you mean? Do you think you could have done better? Dad, I fucking killed it. Did you not hear the crowd? That's not the point. Robert, this is not the time. No. I get where this is going. You just can't be proud of me for once, can you? No, I... Of course I am, but I'm just... It's just that I always wanted... Thanks for coming out, Dad. Dude, it was crazy. What the hell is she doing? Dealing with this the only way she knows how. I told you I wasn't gonna let this happen. As you can see, the D.A.'s office was kind enough to send down Officers Ramirez and Officer... Poland. Poland to make sure that there aren't any misunderstandings. New York law prohibits assisted suicide. Well, that's only because not one terminally ill patient has ever survived long enough to have their case argued in front of the Supreme Court. I don't know nothing about that. - Now you do. - Hey, look, he'll be administering pain medication to me just like every other day, but on this day, I'll be complaining of severe pain. This is barbaric, this whole thing. Pain medication like that is to treat patients, not kill them. Well, um, technically, the licensed administration of drugs puts this under the DEA's jurisdiction... uh, technically. Well, if you guys will excuse us, please? Well, if you officers would like to join us in a Seder... A what-er? Seder. It's a celebration of Jewish history, so... No. Thanks. How 'bout you? Uh, oh, yes, sure. Yeah, why not? I gotta warn you, though, I'm a recovering Catholic. Heh. Oh, we're all... all recovering from something. We're not done talking about this. I'm sure we're not. I think this is it. How do you like it? It's nice. - It's fucked up. - Stop it. No, what? Are we supposed to dig? Why the hell are we here? No, I... Heh. 'Cause I'm buying these four plots to give you the option to occupy the space next to us. - That's what I'm doing. - I'm not even 20, and you want me to pick out my own burial site? Dad, do we have to do this? Well, I thought it would be cathartic. No, it's sadistic. I'm not gonna be put in the ground, - not here, not anywhere. - What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid. I'm gonna be cremated. - No, you are not. - Yes, I am. - What are you gonna do about it? - Our faith states that... Look, I don't care what the Jews do, all right, Dad? I'm not doing it! I'm not gonna be buried next to the Cohens and the Schwartzmans and the fucking Bagelmans! I'm gonna be cremated, gonna be sprinkled over the ocean. You're not gonna be here to stop me. You know, I hope someday, Jonathan, that you become proud of your heritage, that you treat it as a lifeline and not as a sentence. That's what I hope! I'm sorry. I real... I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'll come visit you, and if I die before I have a family, I'll be buried here with you. I'm moving to California. Richard's brother works for a label. We're gonna get started on the album. - What about NYU? - You what? I'm not going. We're gonna get a deal. You are absolutely going to college! This is not the time or place for this conversation. Well, I thought you should know. I'm leaving tomorrow. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. I can't drink the wine. I'm on duty. I'll drink yours. Why don't you just drink it from the bottle? It's where we're headed. We wash our hands. Wash your hands. Hmm. "We praise you, Adonai, "Sovereign of Life, for giving us life and keeping us alive so we may celebrate this season of joy." Is there another prayer that is a little more applicable? It's fine. It's fine. Do it in Hebrew. He can't speak Hebrew. Let's hear your fucking Hebrew. Hebrew. Amen. Yeah, you know, I think we're gonna see Officer Ramirez in our congregation here pretty soon. Well, I am from Guatemala. - Does that matter? - Only in Guatemala. Judaism accepts anyone who can learn the lessons of the Torah. I see. Well, it's a beautiful culture. I'd love to learn more about it sometime. Well, it's a lot of work for a date, buddy, but God knows she needs it. Excuse him. He's a dick. So what happens in the afterlife? Worms crawl in, the worms crawl out Worms play pinochle on your snout Robert! Don't hit me. Never. She doesn't do that. I hope not. Oh, no. No, I believe that once I'm free of this broken body, of the pain and desires... that I can experience God. And also, Jonathan, it's the son's responsibility - to give Kaddish... - Yeah. In order to prove Dad's worthiness as a teacher. Kaddish? - Yeah, you have to. - Yes. You have to attend service every morning at sunrise for 11 months, and you have to say the Kaddish, and you can't cut your hair or your beard. That shouldn't be a problem. You don't have to do the hair part. Oh, yeah, he does. He does. Are you shitting me? Oh, I shit you not. You do. But it would mean a lot... Okay, I didn't see you do it when Pops passed. I know. I didn't, but I pray that you think I was a good enough father to you that you would honor me. Here, Rach. I brought this. Um, and I folded the pa... The page that contains the Kaddish prayer. We'll see. Well, I'd better get back to work. Um, I wanted to leave this with you. It's got my cell on there. Thought maybe you could call if you're having a problem or just call for no reason at all. I'd be careful, you know. If this thing works out, you may have to convert. Please. That wouldn't be so bad. Hmm. I'd better be going. Thanks. It was great to meet you. Nice to meet you, sir. Uh, oh, nice guy. Nice guy, Karen. Are you serious, Dad? Why don't you just bring him into the family, maybe have the Guatemalan Kaddish? Jonathan. I don't believe I ordered the Guatemalan Kaddish. Good one, Dad. Even death is not to be feared by one who has lived wisely. Sounds like kung fu. It's Buddha. There you go. You gave that to him. Tell me something. What kind of wife quotes Buddha in helping a Jew end his life? Someone who has lived a lot longer than you have. And besides, I didn't do it to help him end his life. I needed no help. There is nothing disgraceful about living. That's easy for you to say. This is wrong. It's suicide. Karen, just calm down. I can't. I can't let you do this. Then argue it. What? Argue your case. Build an argument, and present it to me. You tell me why I should keep fighting a fight that I've already won. Yeah. And if I give a convincing argument? I'll go on fighting. I will have the procedures. I will stay attached to the machines. You got eight hours. Here's 27. I'll get a pack. Chill the fuck out! Still relying on the gifts of fortune, I see. For one buck. Just looking for a lucky break. I'm glad you called. I was, um, worried about you. Hey, gorgeous... you got a cigarette? Was what's-his-name jealous? He has a name. He was. No, he wasn't. He trusts me, a concept that is foreign to you, I'm sure. Hey, you're kind of hot. You really think I'm incapable of trust? Well, you have to trust yourself before you can trust anybody else, so... Come on, stud. - Come party with us. - Come on. Ladies, there's nothing more I'd like to do than party with you, but tonight's just not the night, all right? What the fuck? - Relax, buddy. - What? Don't tell me - to fucking relax. - Awesome. Why don't you fucking relax, huh? I'm just trying to have a conversation here. I don't give a fuck what you're trying to do, motherfucker! Ohh! Come on. You all right? I'm sorry. Ladies. Emily! I'm sorry. Hey, sorry. What, John? Thanks for coming. It's nothing. Such a vision on Park Ave, vision in her PJs. I'm sorry I dragged you away from Ari. How are you holding up? I just can't believe that every person on earth has to go through this. I mean, it's fucking brutal. I feel so stupid wasting all this time on insignificant shit. Look, I want you to Know I'm happy for you. You found what you're looking for. While I wish it was me... I'm sure he's a great guy. Look, you're an amazing guy, Jonathan. You are. And someday you will be able to give that brilliant mind and soul to a very lucky woman. I just don't know what that means. Well, it means you have to listen and share, which is two things that you suck at. I know I'm not the best listener, but I share things. I'm not talking about your bed and your toothbrush. I'm talking about life things, like real things, things that move you, things that make you feel, like... like a dream or a song or whatever. You can't do it. - No, I can do it. - No, you can't. No. Heh heh. No. You remember that sunset we watched off the Williamsburg Bridge? Do you remember? The whole sky was glowing. It was like some watercolor painting. All the New Yorkers were smiling, and there's, like, only 15 of these days a year, but that was one of them, and it was perfect. It was sunny out. There was a light breeze, enough to blow the stink of the East River away. Like suddenly all the beauty came out. People are walking around, talking, falling in love. It's days like that that make the rest of the year bearable for me. I remember. I love days like that. What do you want? You're really writing the paper? Writing a brief. High schoolers write papers. Here. Is that coffee? You didn't put sugar in it, did you? - Whiskey, no sugar. - Oh. You're an ass. Well, that is kind of good. She said I don't listen and I don't share, so... No men do. Oh, yeah? Is that why you, uh... Why I what? Gave up on men? Who told you that? Mom. She said you never have boyfriends, but you got all these girlfriends around, so I think she just assumed... Look, okay, I have a boyfriend, okay? - Oh, yeah? - He's just not... well, not someone I can tell her about. Why not? Because he's my professor, and, uh, he's married. Holy shit. Are you kidding me? No. No, the golden child with a married man. I'm impressed. Impressed? Yeah. I didn't know you had it in you... or liked it in you. That is disgusting. What? I'm your sister. Have some respect. Oh, right, right. I forgot. I do not know what is wrong with me. What do you mean? I mean, God, I'm only attracted to unavailable 40-year-old men. I've tried the boys. They do nothing for me. - Of course. - But... heh... when it's an older man and we have to hide it... I don't know... does something for me. Yeah, it's dangerous. I get it. Well, you think I'm fucked up, so... Yeah, a little bit. This whole men-in-uniform thing... Yeah, where'd that come from? - I mean... - I really like it. Mom and Dad, they're both normal. - You know, with them, I mean... - No, they're not. You just left before you were old enough to see it. Did you know Dad's paying for Ethan to go to Oxford? Yeah. What's up with that fucking guy? I mean, you know what? Maybe we were just switched at birth. Well, that would make more sense. You think I blew it? When someone is offering you a free education and you just tell them to go and fuck themselves... - I didn't say that. - You said it repeatedly. Do you really think what Dad's doing is wrong? Feels wrong. Wrong for him or wrong for you? Okay. Okay, I need to get back to work. Good luck. Thanks for the drink, though. Look, I don't think you're fucked up... not any more than anyone else. What are you still doing here? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just, uh... I didn't feel like going home, so... What's up? What is it? You have enough on your mind right now. Ah, come on. I could use the distraction. People grow, and they change, you know, and it's unhealthy if you don't. - Okay. - Okay. Look, it's okay to be scared. Of what? Of life, of... staying, leaving, being on your own. You shared plenty. You did. This guy up here, he must be scared shitless. I mean, not that he'd ever let on. Mortality slapping him in the face for the last 12 years, I'd be pissed... like I had my life stolen from me or something. And all this time, he's never made it about himself, not once, and even now it's about my mom, my sister and me, and that's incredible. I just don't think that I... He lived for us, and... and he did the best that he could, and he never backed down from anything that he didn't think was right... and... I have just completely made this about me. Sorry. It's... it's okay. It's okay. You made me feel better. Yeah? Somehow. I'm glad you're still here. Me, too. I remember I was so nervous first time I ever really cooked. You were sweating because I'd used too much curry, but you ate it anyway, smiling the whole time. I remember your face getting beet red from all the spice, and I was trying so hard not to laugh, because I was afraid I would snort if you got me going... and I did. You made me laugh. You always made me laugh. Hi. I-I'm sorry. For what? You know. Oh, Robert... that was a long time ago doesn't mean anything to me anymore. I'm still ashamed. Nobody's perfect. You're pretty close. You look... You look great. You want to fool around? What are you kids doing up? Isn't it past your bedtime? Shh. Are you leaving? No. You know that Meredith is dying. Yes, she said. She won't live to Christmas. They're taking her off treatment. Oh, my God. God isn't helping, but you can. Look, she's pretty and everything, guys. I'm not asking you to have sex with her. Gross! But it is like a last-wish kind of thing. Will you go to prom with her? Prom? It's missing a button. Give this to her, and act like it was her idea, okay? No. You look beautiful. They tell you to say that? No. You really do. Will you go to prom with me? You gonna put that on me, or are you gonna stand and hold it all night? Put it on. Cigarette ashes - His empty glass - Come on. They seem to tell me Oh, it's over at last His parting kiss Ohh Brought tears to my eyes... Is this how we dance at prom? No. We dance like this. And only time Only time Time will tell - Ohh - Time will tell Yeah, yeah I felt a change The moment he came Walking and Oh, coming through my front door now His conversation was almost, almost the same Still, I could tell that something was wrong His feelings had changed I'll empty those ashtrays His glass put away Straighten my sofa And all those marks, I'll erase But will I ever Will ever erase from my mind Whoa, the way he looked at me The way he looked at me Oh, when he kissed me good night? And only time Only time Only time, only time - Only time - Only time, only time Only time Only time will tell Only time Thank you for tonight. I'll never forget it. Me neither. What? Well, I guess I'm lucky. I never even thought I'd get to do that much. I'll never get to be naked with a boy. I'll never get to drive a car. I'm really glad that I got that kiss. Think I should go. Thank you. Dad. Dad. Your Hebrew is for shit. What happened? I was never good at it, anyway. - Dad... - Where am I? Where am I? - Oh. - You're in the hospital, Dad. Am I dead? Is it... You're in the hospital. I'm not in the hospital. Why are you messing with me? No, Dad, nobody's messing with you. Listen, Dad... Huh? How... How are you gonna take care of yourself? I'll find a way. You have to reconci... You... You have to reconcile with your sister. 'Cause you're... you're the... You're the older brother. She's gonna need you. Dad, I'll take care of her. - I... - Look... Hey, I left you my Speedster. What? But you're not allowed to sell it. That's... That's fine. I won't. I... Dad, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that I left. No, it was my fault. I told you to stand on your own. Yeah, but I didn't. Promise me that you won't sell it. I had it for 30 years, so you promi... promise me. Dad, I promise. I want you to know... that I didn't come back because I was just away for so long. And then when so long turned into longer... The transmission leaks, and you have to change the oil every 2,000 miles... Dad, I need you to stay with me, okay. You just have to rotate the tires. You rotate, but you have-you- Dad, I'll rotate 'em. - You have to rotate... - Listen to me. - The tires, but... - Dad. I just want you - to know, Dad... - You have to rotate... that I didn't come home not because I was mad at you. It was because I didn't want you to see what I had become, because I was ashamed. I just wanted to make you proud. Well, I am proud, son. Yeah, but I didn't do anything. And all this time had passed, and... I couldn't face you... and I was scared. Then it was just too late. I failed you. Listen... no father... no father anywhere... No father anywhere is prouder of his son. If you can take care of that car... you're gonna be fine. Yeah, I will. 'Cause it'll teach you things... that I never could. But don't sell it. I won't. Where'd you get that ugly jacket? Prom. Prom? I'm losing my mind. I love you, Dad. What's that smell? Oh, Dad. We gotta get you cleaned up. I'll go get the nurse. Be right back. Yeah. Have you seen my mother? She's in the nurses' room asleep. What's wrong? He shit the bed. Can you help him out? We'll call someone, but he gonna have to wait a few minutes. Look, I don't want him to have to lay in it. He'll be fine. Look, I'm sorry about before, all right? You want to change him? - Me? - 'Cause you could do it. I'm not gonna change him. That's ridiculous. Well, then, he gonna have to wait. Unbelievable. Thanks, Carrie. Thank you. I hate this, just hate it. I can't take it. I never even really thought about having kids. Never really even wanted 'em. Probably because they never wanted me. Who? My parents. I was a burden. They couldn't afford me. I remember my father saying, "When you have a kid, it changes you." And now I have a kid, and he's changing me. Are you telling me you shit the bed for a punch line? I waited months. You did this? Yeah. Yeah. It would be nice if you held him. Held him? Lie with him. Make him feel safe. Bed's not clean. Does it matter? Your father used to say he liked you more when you were asleep. He used to say the same thing about you. I'm sorry if I wasn't more... You were. You and Dad loved me every day of my life. We did the best we could. I know. Good morning. You're awake. Yeah. Feeling better? Better that it's over. Oh, Robert. You said if I could present a convincing argument, you'd put this off. This may be... the only time I get to... hear my daughter pose an argument as a lawyer, hmm? Can I start? Where are my glasses? Thank you. Please. As citizens of this country, we live under a banner of freedoms granted us by our Constitution. Our complete allegiance to the guidelines and principles of this document has served to make our country the great nation that it is today. That said, there's no precedent, historical or constitutional, for a citizen's right to be made dead. Freedom is not about doing whatever we please. It's about not belonging to someone else. The Ninth Circuit Court felt that the limited few who would be helped by practices such as assisted suicide were not worth the sacrifice to the sanctity of human life. They feared this slippery slope might lead to assisted suicide being performed on depressed, disabled or financially burdened persons who were not terminally ill. You, you are not that person, but by placing your physical comfort ahead of our Constitution, you jeopardize its place as the cornerstone of our society. As my father, you taught me to persevere through the difficult trials in life. I turn to you in facing my own personal challenges... exams, heartbreaks, disappointments and successes. You taught me lessons which cannot be learned in a classroom, and you continue to teach me. So it is with heavy heart that I stand before you today asking you to remain... remain our beacon of light, remain our teacher, our pillar of strength... and r-remain here with us, a living example of everything that you raised us to be. Please, Daddy. Oh, my goodness. You are everything that I raised you to be. You win. I can't promise how long I'll be able to hold on, but I'll try. Is this really what you want, Dad? What I want doesn't matter. Your sister just proved that. She's not dealing with what you're dealing with. She's not the one dying. She doesn't feel it. Tell her what you want. Tell her. I want to say good bye. I'm not ready. Yes, you are. You just proved that. Karen, you're brilliant, all right, and I've known this, and I've never said it. You're the most prepared person that I've ever known. If anyone's ready, you are. I love you so much, Daddy. Yes. And if this is what you want... you can say goodbye. Thank you. You know, I... I just love watching the day come on. I always have. And I... I see all of you, and it's... like... like a sunrise I-I'll watch over and over and over. Yeah. Feel like I've never asked any questions, and now I have so many. Ask 'em. I'll answer 'em. When we were kids... Mambo Bob? He can dance? It's true. Ah, it's true. No, it's not. Hey, tell them it's true. Yes, it is. He could dance. I'm Mambo Bob. Yeah. You never seen me mambo? No. How are we doing today? A fine morning, Doc. It's a beautiful day. Yes. And you're ready? You took such great care of him. You both did. I'm so sorry. You have nothing to feel sorry for. - What if we just... - Shh! No. I love you. You're my everything. You always have been, and you always will be. You made my life sing. Thanks, Doc. You're a great son. What if we had just... Shh! Come here. Come here. I love you. You are my everything. What will I do, Robert? Everything you couldn't do in the last 12 years. You go someplace warm, and you sit in the su... in the sun, and you find yourself. You find someone to laugh with, someone to love. But I love you, Robert. It's all... We'll always have that, always. We've just begun the morphine, and in a moment, I'm going to... remove you from the respirator. Are you comfortable, Mr. Weinstein? You can hold his hands, talk to him. Rachel, I'm gonna slide by you just for a second, okay? And you're sure, Robert? Yeah. No, no, no. No. No, I... I want to see... It has been such a pleasure and an honor knowing you, and I'm gonna miss you so much. Thank you, Doc. Are you going somewhere? I love you. I love you. Okay. It's okay. I love you. Forgive me. - We love you. - Dad. I love you. I'm so sorry. I'll make you proud someday. I promise. - I love you. - I love you. Gonna make you proud, Dad, I swear. You watch over me, okay? Make sure I don't screw up. John, sing to me. I can't. Sing to me. It's okay. Lullaby It's all right. Say good night All is right Go to sleep It's okay. I love you. It's all right. It's gonna be okay. It's all right. They will speak of my father When he's not around You'll be hearing his voice Like you're hearing it now And I'll be the son With his father's books and gun And his breath inside my lungs His words upon my tongue I'm gonna let myself just fall apart I'm gonna let myself just fall apart Something older must end Something new will start I'm gonna let myself just fall apart To the beautiful girl That will never give up And said thanks to the world In spite of her love And what has begun Cannot be undone Like a bell that has rung For my beloved one I want to let myself just fall apart I'm gonna let myself just fall apart Something old must end And something new will start I'm gonna let myself just fall apart La da la La da da La da la da la da la da La da da La da la La da la da la da la da La da la Ohh La la la la la la la la...
