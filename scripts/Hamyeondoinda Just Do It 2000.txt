My family's gone bankrupt. Again?! JUST DO I It's finally over. We truly hope it is. We really saw too much of you. God in heaven! I can live in a place like this. Stop drinking so much. You drank plenty this afternoon. At a times like this, you should drink. Drinks are for drinking. Then we'd have to drink everyday. Son, have a drink. No, thanks, Dad. It's alright son. It's okay to drink if your father gives it to you. I quit drinking, dad. You quit? You were drinking all this time? Dad, give me a drink instead. Jang-Mi! Kids, honey. Let's start going to church. Having faith is the only way to overcome this trial. Just put your faith in me. I'll marry well and save our family. Jang-Mi Yes? It's better for us... when you don't do anything. Yeah sis, just don't do anything. Yes, just stay still. I'll give up my studies and get a job. Do you have any skills? Getting into college is the best thing you can do for us this year. You've finished your noodles. Here, have mine. It's okay, Dad. Go on, Dae-Chul. I'm drinking, so you have mine. Go ahead. But leave some soup. Dad! I'm fine. You go back in. I'll go with you. Go on back in. Those kids... They're all grown up now. Hey, wait! Wait a second! Stop! Stop! Help! Wait a second... Dad! Honey! Where am I? The hospital. The hospital? What is it? What about the bill? Sts and... And? $958 $958?! Dad! Honey! My motorcycle? What are you going to do with it? Will you lend it to me or not? Lightning Quick Messenger Service $958! Did you bring them all? $6.76... $114.02... Don't we have any other accounts? What's this? That? It's an insurance bond someone got me to start paying for. I don't know how much it's worth. Go and cancel the contract. You want to cancel this, ma'am? Yes. Happy Call Insurance Happy Call Insurance. Maximum $1,000,000! No, no! I came for the insurance money! How much did you say this is? $5000! God has heard our prayers! This is a miracle, honey! Oh, Lord! Thank you, dear Father! $4042. What should we do with this? I don't know. Let's see... Insurance. What, insurance? You're going to be an insurance agent? No. We'll to put this money into insurance bonds. And get the insurance money. How? This time you already got hurt, if... Then I'll get hurt again. Stop joking. Do I look like I'm joking? Aren't you?! Honey, let's not do this. It was a miracle. God heard our prayers... You stay here and pray! Good Lord! Wait a second! Wait! No, back up! Back up! What are you doing, Dad? You could have hurt yourself! It was nothing. Lets go. When were you released from the hospital? What about the bills? All paid. Mom? But how? With this! Look to the left This is the right, idiot! Dad, will it really be okay? Trust me. Honey! Here comes one! Really? It's too big! Dad! This one's for real! You crazy... Dae-Chul? Dad? Dae-Chul! Mom? Insurance money? Son, from the way I see it there are two kinds of lives. One is like the lottery and the other is like insurance. Lottery hits you with big money but only once in a lifetime, maybe never. But insurance can depend on what we do. You got the money because you were hurt. You can get hurt again! But, how do you get hurt? Do it! Go on! Dad, I can't! There must be another way! No, there isn't. This is it! It's for our family! So do it! Mom? What are you waiting for? Dad! I can't do it. Do it again. Honey, let's find some other way! Mom's right. Dad, let's find some other way, okay? There is no other way! Dae-Chul, go on and do it! Be a man! Alright. I will! You're right. If we have to do this, it should be done quickly and painlessly. Spread your fingers! Dad, forgive me! Come on! You're right. This won't work. Let's find some other way. Not like this. Something more natural. A more natural way to get hurt. Natural? I got it! Nature! You know, nature! This! Dad, don't worry. A little lightning won't kill you. Over there! Quick! Lift up your umbrella, Dad! Like this? No, higher! I won't get killed, will I? Of course not. Lightning can barely break a little branch. We can't be amateur about this. We have to study! Study! That's it! What can I do for you? We'd like some family insurance. For the whole family. Dae-Chul is a beginner so he'll drive. The front passenger gets hurt the most so... I'll sit there. No, let me. Nonsense! I'm the head of the family. Let's get in! Alright, turn now! Very good! That's how to do it! Let's go! Are you all ready? Now, speed up! Now! Turn! Why'd you do that? It's a "bus only" lane. Then you did good! Here. Speed up. A family accident after a single insurance payment... An accident the same day you bought the car? A total of $30,000! Thank you, God! Mansei! Hurray! Is it okay? Dad's side is too high. Down little. Now, is it okay? No not yet. Almost. There! Is it good? Yes, fine. Just do it! When misfortune arises, people say "Why me?" Insurance is the key to changing that misfortune into happiness. If you sign a contract here to pay $30 won per month... you'll get $300,000 if an accident happens to you on your way out. $30 becomes $300,000. What bank, or stock, or loan shark would assure such benefit? None. The lottery? It's once in a lifetime. Maybe never. But insurance? 100% probability! Just get hurt in an accident and it's 100 percent assured. 100%! Sorry. It's okay. Do you get back the principal if you lose in the lottery? No, they do not. That's right! They don't give you a dime! But with insurance, you get everything back. Man's most beautiful creation ever. I congratulate you for buying it. Thank you very much. But I want not one, but four. Four! Four? Yes. Thank you so much! Where do I put my seal? Here, ma'am. Here you go. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much! Grade 1. When one loses sight in both eyes forever. When one loses the ability to chew or speak forever. 'Forever' means that there is no hope of recovery in the future or, after a certain amount of time recovery cannot be foreseen. We should aim for Grade 6 in our procedures. No.1 - permanent scars on the head or the face. No.2 - losing sight in one eye forever. No.3 - a ruptured disk. Commonly known as a hip condition. No.4 - losing one of the fingers forever. Now, who wants to go first? Jang-Mi? I'm a girl. That's why they pay you more. Why don't you go first, Dad. I am old, you know. That's why they pay you more. Your mother is old too. She's a woman and old. Mom should go first! What do you mean? Youngsters are far better than us. She's right. Dae-Chul, you're youngest. I really think Father should set a good example for us... Alright, then. Let's draw lots. The Ladder Game of Blood Congratulations, Dae-Chul! Congratulations, son!

Bought a house worth $3,000,000, yet none of you have jobs. Doesn't something smell fishy here? I don't smell anything. Neither do I. Well, I do. Something's very fishy here. Why would you put something like that up? "Just do it"? Did you run a Nike store before? It's just a family motto... Do you know it's illegal to hurt yourself... to get insurance money? You can be arrested for insurance fraud. This is a written accusation. I came here to deliver it to you. What's going to happen to us now? We'll be put in legal detention. You mean... like this? He had his eye on us the whole time. What do you think? Isn't it too extreme? It's better than all of us going to jail. Couldn't there be some other way? No. This is the best way. We just have to do this once and everything will be quiet. I'll do it. I agree with you, too How about you, Jang-Mi? I can't do it. I can't! Think it over Jang-Mi! This seems to be the only way, darling. You just have to lure him. We'll take care of the rest. You promise you'll take care of it? Of course! God. Forgive our sins... Thank you! Hello?

Of course it is. Wait! Here you go. I'm sorry, I was mistaken. I think I hurt my chest. Could you take a look at it? I must have hit it when I fell. Is it okay? Okay. It's excellent. Can you feel it for me? What? You mean touch... it? Yes. Here? A little... lower. H-here? A little bit lower. Here? Does it hurt? Come little closer! Now, that's good. What's good?
