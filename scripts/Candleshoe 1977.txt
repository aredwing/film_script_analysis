You hate yourself, knocking cross side. You creeps. You lousy creeps. You saw me after the cups, ha? Shut up! But this is her. Hey! Let's go! I packed your things. She won't need them. They are not good to me. Creeps! You can't get anything on me. I got an alibi. I was with three other guys watching TV when it happened. Big dude! You think I can't bust out the juvenile hall, ha? You think I can't? I can bust any time I want, do you hear? Any time I want, yeah? Hey, listen, give me a break, will you? I mean I am clean, I've never done anything like this in my whole life. Out! This ain't no juvenile hall. Wait for me. So to the hotel, now what? You'll take a bath. What for? Because I said so, that is what for. Don't you even know knock around this place? It's joker. Marking zone, just about where you described them. Yeah. Where did you get those scars? Rudolf Valentino beat me because I wouldn't marrry him. That is the last time you sauce me. Now where did those scars come from? I don't remember. Just keep on not remembering. Put those on! Exellent work, Mr. Jenkins, I'm very pleased. Good. Anything else, Mr. Bundage? No, no. A dress? Put it on! You send me a bill. Mr. Bundage, our agreement was payment on delivery. So it was, so it was. Harry Bundage always honours his agreements. I'll write you a cheque. Casey Brown, no parents, no memory of home, apparent age 14, character bellicose, four times in juvenile home and one time committed to correctional facility, oh dear. And so you know who I am. And who are you? My name is Harry Bundage. My business is finance investments and putting together deals I'm a businessman. You are a hustler. Hey! A hustler, a cun man, I can smell them miles away. You take care of your smell, and don't end out where your ears ought to be. You're right, my dear, of course. A man takes the opportunity when he sees it. You, my girl, are my opportunity, and I'm yours. Opportunity for what? Opportunity to become the honourable Margaret, fourth marchonise of St. Eimen of Candleshoe. That's you again, age 3 sitting on your mom's lab taken just before your father carried you off. What did they think happen to her, mother? She died a year after little Joe disappeared. That is the grandmother the best. Kidnapping made headlines for weeks. That was taken in Los Angeles ten years ago. That is the last. What did they think happen to the kid? Ooh, she might have survived the crash. Wandered all somewhere to dispel the shock afterwards, or the father left her somewhere. She wasn't in the car at all. Anyway, she was never found. Which is where I come in, right Harry? Exactly. You are the perfect double. Age is the same, scar is the same, and what else I've got planned. You'll be able to fool St. Peter himself. It sounds perfect. I got a couple of questions. Certainly. Coffee? Thanks. All right. Question number one: It has got to do with a bundle of money, rght, Harry? You could say that there is that possibility. Okay. Question number two: What is in it for me? For you? Trip to Europe, luxorious hotel, jet flight into the white blue wonder. Okay, okay, what is in it hard cash. Trust Harry Bundage, my dear. You will be taken care of. Yeah, that is what I am afraid of. Now, either we got a deal or we got no deal at all. What do you mean we got no deal. Either we got a deal or you can find yourself another look like fourth marchonaise of whatever he is. I like your style. Pure last me sixteen bloody answers to the pound. All right. What kind of a deal you got in mind? One third of the action. Damn, you little gutterside... Remember Harry, you like my style. ...style. I give you %5. 10. less expenses. Okay, 10 and a red ferrari. And a red ferrari? You don't even have a driving licence. You get the ferrary I'll get the licence. It is a deal. What is our next move? Our next move is to get out of town quick before Jenkins tries to cash that cheque. Buckingham Palace, home of the kings and the queens of England. Royal standarts, that means her magesty must be in his residence with pleasure. Yeah, I have to give her a ring Clara! You are back then. That is like it That's her. That is the one. Hello, deary. You are all right. he? Oh! What a savy girl, you got a right one here. You wasn't born yesterday, was you? Clara, what do you think? Will she pass for the Lady Margaret? She got convinced me all right. What is that? That is my cousin. Miss Clara Grimsworthy, formerly in the service of Candleshoe. She has got all the answers. Yeah. Answers to what? To the questions you have been asking. Here Clara, fetch it down. Now then, have you ever read Treasure Island? Now, I don't suppose you have with your deprived childhood. Ain't deprived, I'm delinquent. There is a difference, you know? A treasure hunt is what we are about to embark on, but the lady kid's game is the real fame. And this. This is our Open Sesame. Crabby piece of paper. Listen, Miss clever dick, that crabby piece of paper, as you call it, is the last will of testament supposedly lost, of Captain Joshua St. Edmund, Marquise of Candleshoe. Now sit down there and listen. Suppose, I wish to tell you, Captain Joshua was a pirate. A piraveteer, they called it, when he was in the nobility, and that one was damn rascal, one of the best He brought back enough booty to ransom a Maharaja. and he hid it somewhere in Candleshoe, only no one ain't ever found it. And one day I comes along. Who is telling the story, Clara? Then one day, Clara comes along, she is polishing the bed posts inside Joshua's own room, she found a secret door, behind it is this. And then when she gets the sack... I resigned. When she resigned, she takes the will with her and she brings it to dear cousin Harry. How do you know it is the real mccoy? Look at this! A Spanish doubloon. Just wet the appetite, as you might say. How much does it worth? Four thousand dollars. And there are thousands of them. So he tells where he hid the gold in the will. Not likely. And old black villain isn't giving away anything for nothing. Instead of telling where he's hid the gold, all he does is give us the first clue. And that is why we want someone in Candleshoe. Free to follow up the other clues one by one. And that someone is you. Yeah. providing we can convince your old dame I am the long lost what's her name. We'll convince her all right. By the time we finish with you, my girl, you'll think like that kid, you will feel like her, you'll behave like her. When the old lady believed that you are the long lost grandaughter, you'll believe it yourself. Play her the tune, Clara. Hear them? What is it? That part is your passport to Candleshoe. Kidneys and liver, you can't eat them. You also do not like spinach, cabbage and boiled fish. Who does? You do like bananas, short bread and rice pudding. Rice pudding? You adore it. And you can't eat strawberries. They bring you out in a rash. Check. Dear Lady St. Edmund, I'm writing to you on a personal and confidential matter. Recently, I was in the city of Los Angeles. You had two stuffed animals. And you call them Teddy and Piggy Wig. I think I am going to throw up. Teddy and Piggy Wig! Teddy and Piggy Wig! And your mother's favourite scent was lilac. I shall await your reply. Respectfully Yours. Harold W. Bundage Esquire. Dear Lady St. Edmund, Dear Mr. Bundage, I am writing to you. You are not the first person who claimed to have discovered my granddaughter. And I daresay you will not be the last. However, if you care to bring the child to Candleshoe next Tuesday, I'm perfectly willing to meet her. The dame seems to be eager. Just let it drop out all the things you remember. Feel you've seen the old lady before with all that seems familiar, and then hint the secret hiding place. All right, Harry. Now as soon as you settled in, you start looking for the second clue straight off. And do you remember the first one? Yeah. For the sunrise student there is treasure among the books. Don't you memorise it? For the sunrise student there is treasure among the books, Okay? Now what I figure is that the second clue should be somewhere in the library Yeah. Where in the library? You stupid little nit, if I knew where, I wouldn't be sending you look for it, Would I? You just have to go through every book to find it. Oh, me? There it is, Candleshoe. What a shack! Remember, you like banana, short bread and rice pudding. And I hate liver, spinach,and boiled fish, relax, Harry. Right. Right. Harry, Harold W. Bundage to see the lady St. Edmund by appointment, Yes, ladyship is expecting you, sir. Your hat, sir. If you wait here for a moment, I'll tell her ladyship you've arrived. Ah, there he is. Captain Joshua St. Edmund himself. What if he was clever with his gold and his clues? But he didn't know he was coming up against Harry Bundage. We'll see who comes out on top, you know me. You step this way, her ladyship will see you now. Be careful for your step, sir. Four hundred years polishing, it is a trifling slippery. You ought to have a warning. Yes, sir. Thank you, it will be suggested to her ladyship. Mr. Bundage, my lady. How do you do Mr. Bundage? Charmed, I'm sure. This is Miss Brown, Miss Casey Brown. Hi. How do you do? Won't you sit down? Thank you. Thank you, indeed. Vow, what did you get out here? How many rooms? I haven't counted them. Would you serve the tea, please, Priory? Tea, Mr. Bundage? Oh, yes, please. How do you like it? Milk, please, and two teeny meeny lumps. Two teeny meeny lumps. Miss Brown? Oh, you got a cherry cola? I'm afraid not, my lady. A glass of lemonade, perhaps. Eh, right, lemonade would be fine. Now, then, Mr. Bundage? Ah, well, my lady, I'm a private investigator. I was engaged to a case of fifteen year old girl who ran away from her aptolis angelis. And quite by chance I came across a dossier of this little girl. She has a scar on her forehead and another on her shoulder. I understand your little granddaughter injured her head when she fell off a pony and tore her shoulder one some barbed wire. Thanks. So you brought her to me. I wonder why? There is no reward, you know. It would be sufficient reward for me your ladyship to know that I restored your long lost daughter to you. Yes, now, child, let me look at you. Your spectacles, my lady. Oh, thank you, Priory. I've, what is called, "failing eyesight". Is there something wrong? No, no, everything is fine. Do you get some strawberries, Miss? Yeah, I love them. But I can't eat them. I break out the hides all over the place. I always have. I will have one of those cookies, though. A piece of short bread perhaps? Oh, that's what it is. Well, I've never had any, but I'll try anything once, right? Mr. Bundage said that you were four years old when you were found. Do you remember your parents? No. That stuff is not bad. What is that, Priory? Oh, I beg your pardon, my lady. I thought perhaps Miss Brown cannot eat strawberry, she might care for per condie That looks like rice pudding. Sanrm, yle. What do you know? I'm crazy about this stuff. Even at home I couldn't get enough of it, all the other kids used to hate it. Have you got a spoon? Yes, of course, Miss. Priory, I think, we could do with some hot water. Very good, my lady. Excuse me for a moment. Priory! Yes, my lady. Ah. Eat it. I can't, I had enough. Strawberries, short bread and rice pudding. That is rather unscrupulous of you, Priory. You are quite right, my lady. Most unscrupulous. You just let things take their course, shall we, Priory. Uh, uh, delicious. More tea, Mr. Bundage? No, thank you, your ladyship, I'm quite content. Why do you keep staring at my fireplace? Oh, I don't know, I guess I must have seen another one just like it some place before, except what I saw had a kind of hole in it. A hole? Yeah, I used to hide things there. Ah, well. It must have been a movie I saw in a TV show. Listen. I got to say this, you seem like a really nice old lady and everything, but I ain't your granddaughter. What makes you say that? Oh, I don't know, I just know it, I mean, I have never seen you before in my life. All right. The truth is this guy over here comes to me and he says, he thought that I was that little girl, the other one got lost, and he says, he has got to bring me to England to see you. I figured why not. You know, ride on a plane, get to going fancy hotels. What if I get to lose. But that is all there is to it. I see. Yeah, sorry, put you down anything. Yes, we better split, ha? I myself am awfully sorry, ladyship. I wished you had been convinced. Thanks for the lemonade and rice pudding, ha. See you. Bye bye. Ah? You did that on purpose. You rotten little scump. You deliberately shut the whole thing, straight at the start... Priory? Is there a loose brick in the fireplace? Loose brick, he? I don't think so. How very odd! Stay cool, Harry, relax. Cool, relax? When I think of the money I spent, fares, expenditures and what I paid to bloodsucker Jenkins. You gave him a bum cheque, you probably stiffed the hotel, too. Oh, you wake like a jewel. Harry! Mr. Bundage! Mr. Bundage, Mr. Bundage! What is that? Mr. Bundage, Her ladyship says, would you step inside again for a moment. You and the young lady. Why, certainly, I'd be glad to. Soon after you left, we examined the fireplace. There was a loose stone. Are you kidding? And there was something hidden in the cavity behind it. Do you recognise this? A box. No, I don't think so. Look carefully, dear. Are you sure you have never seen it? It's very important. No. No. Although... I don't understand. Oh, my dear! Oh, my dear! Welcome to Candleshoe! Welcome to Candleshoe! Welcome to Candleshoe! She did it! She bloody did! Would you be so kind, Mr. Bundage, to go to town and return to the child's things. I would be most impressive. She wouldn't even let her leave. She wouldn't let her even come back to get her bleeding clothes. Oh, Harry, Harry! Clara! We are in. We are in. Come in. I put these away, but they belong in here now. Teddy and Piggy Wig. Well, I called them Teddy and Piggy Wig? That what you called them when you were a little. What odd! But only... Yes. I know, just a, it seems to me she smelled like lilacs. That was your mother's favourite scent. Oh. Good night, dear. Yeah, night. Sleep well. Dining room, great hall. Drawing room. Library. You just have to go through every book that you find it. It has got to be a million of them. Where there is Will there is a Way. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Search and you will find. Hi. Who are you? I'm Cluny, you've missed the breakfast. Mr. Priory send me to find you. Check. Here she is. Hi. Good Morning, Miss Margaret, how about some breakfast? Bobby, go and get fresh part of marmalade. Come and meet the rest of the family, Miss Margaret. Ah, Listen, if you don't mind, my name is Casey, ha? If you prefer it... Cluny, you already met. Yeah, right, I met Cluny. Over here, struggling with the churn, is Peter. Hi. Hello, welcome to Candleshoe. This is Anna. Hey, somebody catch. Hey, well held. The acrobatic member of the family is Bobby. Now, what about breakfast? Oh, no, look, this will do. Are you sure? Yeah, positive. Anna, give her a glass of milk. Come on Bobby, help me with the seperator. When you finished that, you can help making the beds, okay? You got to be kidding. Margaret, Margaret, my dear. Her ladyship? She is not coming in here. I hope not. Casey, go and see what she wants? Quick! Hi. Ohoo, there you are. Good Morning. Are you calling me? Yes, I was actually, I wondered if you liked to take a little walk with me. Oh, bother. Priory! Oh, there you are, my dearies. Good morning. Hello, grandmother. Anna, I see you met your new friend. Yes, grandmother, in the kitchen. Anna, would you go and find Priory for me, please. Yes, grandmother. Grandmother, now that your real grand daughter is here, would you send us away. Good gracious! If I did that, whom would I find slide up and down the great hall? Splendid! Yes, my lady? Priory, I seem to have mislaid my spectacles again. Will you keep an eye out for them. Of course, my lady. And Priory, fetch me a stale bread, I am taking Miss Margaret for a stroll around at Candleshoe. Very good, my lady. Priory! My lady. Where are the fresh roses I ordered for the hall table. I'm sorry, my lady, it is Mr. Gipping, he is one of the cranky moods again. He woouldn't let me in his garden. What a cheek. Indeed! It is not his garden, it's my garden. And so I shall tell him immediately. Now, oh, my lady, he will be having his cup of tea. Oh, good heavens, come on, quick. Hey, what is going on? Don't tell her. She has to know. Not now. Come on. Tell me what? This place is a nut house. Gipping, where are you? Gipping! Ah, there you are. Gipping! I wish to speak to you. Gipping, when I order roses for the house, I pick the cat roses, is that clear? All you need is orders, you see? If I meet your orders, your flowers come bust. Oh, do they, indeed? You used to be a good, pleasant gardener, but in recent year you become fairly tiresome and crotchety. So that is the way, is it? Crotchety, am I? If I am known to be associated with such a character, I do wash my hands and put on my sunday best Gipping, we are discussing roses. Go about a lot to work, and be subjected to insults. You get wind up drawers about nothing. Mr. Gipping! You are patrion old woman, now ten more roses I'll see you fat. Your roses? Very well. If that is your attitude you are dismissed. Priory! Priory! Quick! Help. Get the boots, get the boots. Priory! Oh. Priory! Psst, psst. Yes, my lady. I have dismissed Gipping. I wish him packed and out of here by this evening. I see. You wouldn't care to reconsider the matter, I suppose? Certainly not. He was impertinent. That is just his way, my lady. And he would be very hard for me to replace. He would? Very hard. And I'd make sure that you had fresh roses for the hall every morning. You would. Well, perhaps I might give him one more chance. But you may tell him that this is positively his last. Oh, my lady, the stale bread. Oh, thank you, Priory. Oh, Margaret, my dear, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. Oh, that is okay with me. I don't mind at all. Good. I tell you what I think. I think she is no more lady the grand than a postman She is here for a purpose. And it is up to us to discover what it is. These kids back at the house? They were lady too? No, not really, they were of children's home just outside the village. That was terribly crowded and I had so much room here, so they agreed to let them stay with me. Somehow we've become a family. Lovely, isn't it? Yeah. Never seen anything like it. What is that over there? That is the boundary of Candleshoe. I don't suppose your experience of family life has been a happy one. What family life? I tell you, the only thing I remember about family life is nothing, zero. One forstamped to another I mean, who wants to care about the the kids to take an inch for welfare money and food stuffs? I mean, who really cares? Rackets just like everything else. Who worries the rackets. First thing I ever learned is to know in the morning to duke something, ha? Get him up, first punch is yours. I see. Yeah, well. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. But you can't go through life alone. I ain't alone. I got me. Listen, if you don't hand it out, you don't have to worry about not getting to pack. "For the sunrise student there is trasure among books..." "For the sunrise student there is trasure among..." Aah, who is it? Yeah. Come on in. It's me. Are you awake? Yeah, I think I am. How come, you are not in bed. I got something for you. What is that? Garlic. Garlic? Garlic keeps ghosts away. Garlic keeps everyone away. Thanks, kid, but I don't believe in ghosts. Not even the ghost of Captain Joshua? His boots creaking on the corridore in search of his hidden treasure. His sword tap, tap ,tap on the panelling of his death. Please, have garlic. Thanks, kid. I like you. Yeah, I like you, too. And now beat it Good night. Good night. Hey, kid, everyone else in bed? Except me, good night. Good night. There has got to be a million, like a needle in a haystack. What on earth are you doing here? I was trying to find a book to read. In the dark? I couldn't find the light switch. Oh, oh, you get me a fright. I thought you were an intruder. I gave you a fright. I took the short cut. The house is full of secret passages. I came to find a book, too. On plumming. Isn't the gardener any good at plumming? Gardener isn't much good at gardening. I suppose you are wondering why. You probably don't know. You'll find out soon enough anyway. There is no other staff because we can't afford to pay their wages. You kidding? I'm afraid, not. The old lady, I mean, grandmother, she doesn't know you're broke? We're not completely broke. Just a little near the edge. We take in some tours. Tours? Yes, we open the house to the public one day a week and then we sell eggs, fruit, cakes, jam, that sort of things at the village market. Usually we stay just ahead of the rates and taxes. This big house, there must be a lot of junk you could sell. Those having real value went years ago. That picture, one of the old copies, one or two junk doesn't worth anything. Well. Now that you know all our secrets, I hope you keep them. Why not? Good. That really makes you one of the family. You were looking for a book, ha? Yeah, yeah. So is I. Where did I put? Plummers help? Plummers help? Last month the roof started to leak rise the water tank. Find what were you looking for? Ooh, no. I found mine. Care maintenance of T joints and S bends, just the thing for the bedside reading. Good night. Good night. THE PATHS OF GLORY LEAD BUT TO THE GRAVE Sunrise students... Yeah. The paths of glory lead but to the grave. That's it. I found the clue. International investment advisors limited. Is that you, Harry? What, yes. It's her. Hello, are you there? Of course, I'm bloody here. Where have you been? Never mind. Did you find anything in that library? Yeah. Listen. I thought you said all I had to do is look through a few books. Have you ever seen that library? Anyway, it wasn't in any book. It isn't time telling me where it wasn't, tell me where it was. In the window. In the window? Stupid little nutter. What do you mean, "it was in the window"? Stained glass window. You can only see it when the sun is coming up. It said, "the paths of glory lead but to the grave". The paths of glory lead, where? To the grave. It's a poem by a guy named Thomas Gray. I asked grandma, you know, the lady. She says, it is an eulogy in the country churchyard. I'll call you if I find out more. Hello, I'm not finished yet, little sweep. Clara! Leap round to the public Library and ask them a man called Thomas Gray. He wrote a sort of eulogy about a graveyard. Who are you telephoning? My stockbroker. I told them to buy four thousands share of alakezem salt and pepper. Listen. You are up to something. I want to know what it is. Now, you listen. If you don't keep your snar out of my business, your smeller wind up with your ears ought to be. Well, I must be off. I'll be back by late afternoon. Granma, you know that poem by Gray, that churchyard thing, you said it was in the Library. Oh, yes, we have a very nice copy signed by the author, I believe. There you are, my dear. Return it when you finished with it. Good afternoon, John Henry. Good afternoon, melady. How are you today? Oh, thank you, you are very kind, melady. I'm in the pink, you might say. Oh, how is your uncle George? Ah, melady, I didn't think necessary to trouble you with the news. We finally had the measuring of his wooden overcoat. Wooden?... We buried him last week. I'm sorry to hear that. But he has been ill for some time, hasn't he? Oh, begging ... pardon and being wishful to do justice to one and all and not speak evil of the dead, I must say, Uncle George was uncommon fond of the bottle. He was, you might say, distinctively overpartial and it was that what carried him off to that end. Oh, John Henry, I hope that will prove a lesson to you. To me, melady? Because in recent years, you have been known to take a drop too much yourself and to be unavailable to carry out your duties. Oh, yes, I see, well, very sorry indeed, Mary. Now you may take me to the vicarage. Wait until the meeting is over and bring me back. Very good, melady. I shan't be long, my dears. Too much. Well, come on, back to work. We got three hundred pounds to make up. If your so sure of cash, why can you not sell, that car? Grandmother was hated, that is why. Anyway, it doesn't belong to us, it belongs to the bank. Mr. Priory had to borrow money for the last year's taxes. Bobby and I get things ready for the tour. Come on, you will have to polish the floor of the great hall. Oh, thank you for the trip. Polish it, not a stain on it. We'll go to jam making. I left apples outside the back door. And you go and get jam jars washed. You can peel and core the apples You can peel and core the apples, queeny. I'm busy. Just a minute, queeny. Listen you! Whoever you are, you are going to do your share like the rest of us. Do you want to bet? You just do your share! It is all the more rest of us to do. What a pity! You listen to me. Give me that book. To keep castle going we all have to work. We have to work very hard. We don't do it because someone is forcing us to, but because love grand, because we like being here. And if you are going to stay here, you have got to help. Have I made that clear? Yeah. Then let me make one thing clear, queeny. Around here you are the help and I am the boss. You want to play rough, do you? You shouldn't have done that. She's asked for it. All the same, it is not very nice thing to do. Go and see what happen to chickens, Bobby. Okay. Cluny, no. Nice try. Cluny! Oh, Cluny, you shouldn't have. Yeah, Cluny, you shouldn't have. Hey, get off my back. That wasn't very nice. You got to be kidding. Let go! Stop it! Are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Two against one. Yes, what was grandmother going to say when she finds it out? We had the nicest meeting we had in months No, thank you. That grateful man Quantenly was away, dipping his sheet, whatever it is, he does. We made final plans for our automn bazaar. We discussed combining the Christmas Eve entertaintment at the town hall with the church supper on the Christmas day. And then we pledged to raise a hundred pounds above our quota in this year's Red Cross drive. Then we had tea and the vicar told us amusing stories about his youth in India. Do you know, Gipping is doing much better with the flowers. Do you think you'll se him this evening, Priory? There is a distinc possibility, my lady. You may tell him, I'm pleased. And then the vicar told a funny story about an elephant. Why do you let your hair hang over your face like that, dear? It covers your lovely eyes. Push it back! Push it back, Margaret! Oh, what happened? Might I ask? Do you want to know how I got into this mess? All right, I'll tell you what happened. I was sitting at the vegetable garden. Breeding, minding my own business. Cluny came up to me, yeah, she came up to me. And... and she wanted me to help with the few things she was doing. I said, sure, you know, why not, so I get up to go with her, trip over garden hose, bang my eye and fell over tea kettle down the hill and into the barney, come up covered wit rubbish. Can I have some mash potatoes, please? Priory, you will tell Gipping to be more careful in the future of where he puts the garden hose. As you wish, my lady. The country churchyard. Shut up! You miserable, double-crossing little worm! You thought you are all out, Harry, did you? After all he has done for you. I was thinking all that time, really. I saw that church. I thought, maybe... Yeah, stroken good fortune. So did I. Eulogy in the country churchyard? Well, that's grave in it. Yeah, look at it, look at it, nothing just his name and when he died. Marbe that is the clue, Harry. When he died, maybe that means something. Like what? He didn't know when he was going to die. Here we are to dig him up. Dig him up. What is the matter with you? Do you want to wake up the whole house? Here, the old devil , he followed the eclipse for richess and fame and if he would prosper, do ye the same. Thomas Gray. In a country churchyard. The cunning old devil. Do you think that is an eclipse, Harry? Of course, it is. Here, anything to do with an eclipse, now you go through that old house from top to bottom and don't you do nothing else. Do you hear me? Yeah, yeah. Get back to the house before they miss you. I'll be in touch in a day or two. So you better have something for me. Aren't you going back to London? London? I can't show my face in London while all the sharks around my gullet. You listen to me. If they chew me, I'll chew you. And Don't you forget it. I could be feeding you to the fishes and no one will ever know. Hh! You don't think he is joking. Have you ever seen anyone who has been fed for the fishes? Very nasty, that is. Now and then a person is hold up out of the sea and the authorities looks them through squinched of their eyes, oh, what an horrible massacre, bear to see it and throw him back in. And that is the end of that person. And that is what'll happen to you if you don't do what is expected of you. Just remember! I got for you first two clues, didn't I? Well, you better find the next one and be quick about it. Good morning. Hi. Good morning Casey. Good morning. Did you sleep late? Yeah. Would you like some scum? We've just made. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. That is for Casey, not you. The rest are for tea. What was the last time you heard about an eclipse around this place, ha? Here Bobby, make yourself useful, polish that. Eclipse of the sun or eclipse of the moon? Either. We hear sometime. Why do you ask? No reason. Look, look, what I found? Oh, good. Cucumber. He loves cucumber sandwiches. What's going on? Who does? Today is the first place to set them out. So what? The first Wednesday of the month Colonel Dennis comes to tea. Who is Colonel Dennis? More tea, Colonel? Oh, yes, thank you very much. By jove, they are delicious, those cucumber sandwiches. They are my favourite. I remember, the club at Cornpow my sice used to bring me cucumber sandwiches every afternoon. Do you know, dear vicar was talking about India yesterday and he said, the sice is a groom. Yes, of course, quite right, yes..., slip of the tongue. My sice used to bring my horse every afternoon. A black horse. Seaton, Seaton, dear old Seaton. Oh, many of a gin and cognac I won with dear old Seaton. It was at the time of game manouvres. Does he really ride that good? Not likely. Mr. Priory is terrified of horses. Dennis, he said, you haven't bought that brood, have you? You never get on his back. Well, I took ald Seaton, I went over those jumps three times at full gallop. Where are you going with those? I got bread scums. Wait a minute. I got an idea. Splendid, but very dangerous Oh, my dear lady, one doesn't consider danger, when one is a soldier. Oh, Margaret, my dear child. Oh, Colonel, you haven't met my grand daughter, Margaret. I'm delighted. Hello there. What are those? Oh, these are some scums. Mr. Priory thought the Colonel would like some. You have met Mr. Priory, the butler? Yes, of course. Splendid fellow. Well, I must be on my way. Delicious tea, delightful company. My dear Colonel Dennis, your visits are much too short. They bring a breath of the outside world. How fortunate it was for me that you moved into the neighbourhood, just when my last old friend left. Oh, I wouldn't miss my monthly visit with all the tea and china. Ah, hello children, all well? Oh, yes, Colonel Dennis, thank you. Good boy. Is that your horse? Yes, it's a bit nag actually, but perfectly all right getting around the countryside. Yeah, I've never seen a saddle like this. Where I come from there are Western saddles. Is it hard to ride on him with this tiddy biddy things? No problem really, with these good hands. Beat me! How do you stay on one of these? Could you show me, Colonel? Now? Oh, well, some other time. Please? Well, the animal is tired. I rode him pretty hardcoming over here. I had to be walking home. Grandmother. My dear Colonel, do, please, indulge the child, and me, too. I've never seen you on horse back. Yes, well? Please? Please? Please? Please? Let us see you gallop up the drive in true cavalry fashion. Well, anything to give you pleasure, of course. You aren't mounting that side, are you? I'm just checking rubber, leather pieces here. The gird, sir. I know it is the gird. It is a regimental policy always to check the gird before mounting. Just do wait. How to get this started? You could have this thing with you. Colonel's horse must be even more mettlesome than old Seaton was. Did you see him going up the stairs with the tour? Yeah, he had to go. One at a time. Oov. All right now, if you laugh, just remember, he'll laugh last, last, last. Oh, how did it go? I'm afraid castle tour didn't help much. With the takings of today's tour and the refreshments we're still a hundred pounds short. Hundred pounds? Really? When do you have to pay the taxes? About a week. Eight days, to be exact. Oh, come on now, cheer up. We still have time. We still have a few things we can take to Mr. Threshers. And next Saturday at the market we can sell more fruit, more vegetables, more jams and more Cluny's cakes, we ever sold before, right? Right. Now, you finish setting up the store. Peter and I will take the stuff to fruit sections. All right. All right? Come on, Peter. I hope we would do well today. We have to do very well. We have never taken as much as a hundred pounds before. You haven't? Well, maybe your sales technique needs a little overhauled Sales technique. Yeah. Any of what you got to sell is the way you sell it. Okay, okay. Walk up, folks! Walk up folks! You have never seen such enormous eggs in all your life. You can dice them, spice them, fry them, scramble them. We got round ones, large ones white ones, small ones, anything you like. Fantastic. Every one laid by that famous hen, mirrorbell. Walk up, folks! Walk up, folks! If you're lucky you might get lots of candy vegetables grown by the famous gardener, Gipping, who works with the queen of Buckingham Palace. Who wants enormous eggs, now? Enormous eggs. I'll take half a dozen, please. Glad you got here early, madam. About half an hour all poultry will be sold out. Oh, in that case I'll take a dozen. A dozen for this lady. Okay. Don't miss our gingerbread which Captain Joshua St. Edmund took on his treasure hunting voyaging. Guarenteed towards all the headaches of Carribean winds. You can't say that. Why not? We are selling them, aren't we? Cakes, delicious scum cakes. Five pence, please. Thank you. Thank you. How did we do, Mr. Priory? Unbelievably wonderful. Splendid. The most splendid market we've ever had. Do you mean we nearly made up a hundred pounds? With what we sold to Treshers and thanks to Casey's salesmanship it is simply graceful. Oh, dear. Is that rain? My ladyship is all alone. She hates thunder. Casey, up on your bike and go on home and take this with you. Go on, go on. Go on, pack up. Get the eggs, cakes and jams Here take my sweater. No, I don't want it I have my jacket, and I'll get on the cart. Okay. Bobby, get those empty boxes and put them on the cart. Okay. Peter! Coming. Good bye. Get that end. Grandmother! Grandmother! Who is there? Who is that? Shhh, Quiet! Do you want the world to hear? What are you doing here? Did you put the lights off, Harry? No, must be the storm here. Why didn't I hear from you, he? And what are those stuff in the village market, he? Buy my eggs, all large, brown, white, boil and fry. Watch your leg! Well, I... I got... I got to pretend, all like. I'm one of the family, don't I? You have got to find that treasure. That is what you got to do. And no mucking about. Do you hear? What does eclipse mean? Do you hear? Well, I don't know, just yet. But I'm working on it. I really am. Priory, children. No. It's me, Casey, ee, Margaret. You keep that old lady out of here, or she dips it with this. Now, get rid of her. Oh, Margaret, my dear, oh, I'm so glad you are back safely. Where are the others? All in town with Priory. In this dreadful weather? They'll be back pretty soon. Every time there is an electrical storm our lights go dead. Priory always knows how to fix them, though. What do we do without him, I can't imagine. Oh, I must go and dress for dinner. Hey, what are you doing with that? What does it look like? I am taking it. Ain't I? Yeah, but that is the money for the taxes. That money is going to save my eye and feed the old sharks. Say, you were attacked by a burglar when they got back. Yeah, but if they don't pay the taxes, then they'll have to leave and I will not be able to search for my clues. So much the better. We'll have the place to ourselves to ransack it from top to bottom. Harry! Keep an eye on that eclipse. I won't let you. Harry! Harry, wait, please. Let's get out of here. Harry, don't, Harry. Get out of the way. Get out of the way, I tell you. Please don't. Get off! Get off, I said. Stop, Harry. AUCTION To be held at Candleshoe. I checked all the wardrobes upstairs, my lady. I'll see to other things, gramophon and so on. All sent on to your new address. Thank you, Priory. My husband and me on our wedding day. Most handsome couple, my lady. Yes, And this is my dance programme from the Balberry Hill for the Prince of Wales at Candleshoe. The prince asked me for every dance. My husband was furious. Your Highness is a most striking man. I remember the Waltz. I believe I still have a gramophone record of it. Here it is. On top we had glorious times here, hadn't we? I thought dancing at Candleshoe would have never end. But it has at last. No. Soon perhaps, but not so long as I'm here. Please, play the gramophone record, Priory. And you and I'll waltz. Oh, never lady, absolutely not. I insist. It wouldn't be appropriate. Would it be appropriate if I were to waltz with Colonel Dennis? I'm sure, he dances better than he rides You did him very well, Priory. You knew, ha? We were playing games with time, you and I. And I thank you for it. I'm terribly embarassed. You needn't be. I'm very grateful for your splendid talent and even more for your compassion. And now, if you please, the gramophone record. We're here to see Casey Brown. Yes, she is in bed. Hi. This is for you. Thanks. These are for you, too. They are plums. They are kind of squashy. Thanks. How are you feeling? Okay. Oh, you are right. They are kind of squashy. Haven't caught the thief yet. No? The police haven't got anything to go on. Well, like I told them, I never saw his face. You were in the kitchen with him. You chased him all the way through to try to stop his car and never saw his face? It was dark. Well, we have come to say goodbye. What do you mean, goodbye? Where are you going? We have got to go back to church in town. Candleshoe is being sold to pay the rates and taxes. What about grandma? There is a place in the county house. Very nice really. Lots of people at her age. You are putting me on, aren't you? Grandma is at old folks' home? With the house gone, there was nowhere else she had to go. Look, Casey, if there is anything you know that you haven't told us... I don't know anyting. Anything. Well, I'm afraid we must go. Yeah. Thanks for the plums. Goodbye, Casey. We'll miss you. Don't lose your garlic. I won't. Goodbye. Hey! Cluny, all of you! Come on back. I got a few things to say. This was the last clue. He followed the eclipse for riches and fame and if ye would prosper, do ye the same. What, perfectly simple. The eclipse was a ship. A ship? Captain Joshua's ship. There is a picture of it in the house. Captain Joshua abord the eclipse, accepting the sword of Spanish Captain, whose ship he had captured. Of course, that is the clue. Come along everyone. It is hanging in the hall. My Lady? It is not hanging in the hall. You sold it, Mr. Tresher, you sold my painting. It was my painting. You sold it to me. That is, Mr. Priory sold it to me, that is. Mr. Thresher, it was quite proper to sell the painting, but it is impelled for us to look at it. So who did you sell it then and where is it, now? Well, I sold it to an American lady only yesterday. She said that Captain Joshua reminded her of her father. Another pirate, no doubt. I had it packed up and sent down to Hambledon Station It is leaving at 12:20 for London. 12:20. She has gone down the SouthHampton, in time to embark on Queen Elisabeth. Get in the car, Peter. We'll catch the train 12:20. But it is 12:15 now. 12:20 was never on time for eight years. There goes the train 12:20. 12:20. What a terrible time to break a perfect record. This is the last opportune here in London. Are we late? Of course, not. Give chase, Priory. We must let them down somehow. Everybody out. Priory, you parked my car across the track. Yes, my lady. Where is the train stopping sign? There isn't stopping sign. They have marvellous brakes on this locomotives. Over there, quick. My lady. I shall remain here, thank you. My Lady? You just said it would stop in time. Yes, but... They have marvellous brakes, I believe. My Lady, I must insist. I shall not leave this car. Just make sure it does stop in time? Very good, my lady. Thank you, Priory. Here now, what is going on? Do you mind... Do you mind if we have a look at something in your baggage van? Yeah, that is the eclipse, all right. But where is the clue? Captain Joshua has his sword to the document. Is something written on it? Under foot in the great hall look high look low scavo so end just the statement. In the great hall? Under foor? Priory, do you have the key? I have it, my lady. Peter, go and get my tools, hurry up. Right here, under the mantle somewhere. Mr. Bundage? What a dreary idea! What on earth are you doing here? My ladyship, good afternoon, we saw the place after sale, we could stop and have a quick look around. Until tomorrow this house is mine and will you all kindly leave? I made a nice cup of tea for you, Harry. Lorry! Grimsworthy! What is she doing here? What are you doing here? You were dismissed for stealing and you were told never to return. All right, stop that talk. Charlie, shut the doors! All right, come on. You stay here, my lady. Let go! Let's call the police. It's engaged. What? Busy! Come on, hurry! Priory, the children! We must see what is happening to them. I'll go my lady, you stay right here. Mr. Bundage, put that down at once. Keep back! Let's stop being hasty. That treasure, it is only mine or else nobody's. This is an emergency. No, there is nothing wrong with my telephone. Give me that. Come on! Hurry! Hello, operator, operator. Leave that phone! Look out! Hello, operator! Get him! All right, quick, go and get the police. Go quickly! To the police, quick! Now, go on, go, go! Hey, Clara! Go to this way! Priory! You swine! My regimental tie. Did Gipping get away? I don't know. Cluny, you better go for help just in case. Look out! Hey, duck! Hey. Come here. What's happening? Kuchi, kuchi, kuchi, kuchi. And don't come back! Everybody to the great hall, quick! My lady, please. Casey, find something to close the door. How about that? Do you think that is going to hold? No, I don't. We barricade it, as well. Right. How about the iron sailor? Good idea. Everybody help. Mind your hands, my lady. Push! Don't stand, get them! What is going on? Captain Joshua, you old rogue I'm not very good at good byes. Apparently not. Where are you going? I don't know. Bad days, I guess. I see. Now, listen. I never belong to Candleshoe. I mean, I pretended I did, but I don't, all right. Not enough excitement here for you? Yeah, you must be kidding. Perhaps it is the people in Candleshoe you don't care for? Priory, the children. Well, they are okay. Perhaps it is me? Yeah, okay, you got it, it is you. I mean I came here to do a number on you. You are straight hussle. I mean, I didn't know you and I didn't care, but now... But now? Now... now it is diferent. Thank you. I'm very fond of you, too. I don't mind in the least that you lied to me when you first came to Candleshoe. But my feeling would be hurt very much if you lie to me now. Do you really want to go back to Los Angeles? Never cried in my life. Then I think it is just about time that you did. Come along, my dear. We are going home. Supposing, your real grand daughter shows up? Perhaps she has.
