There you are. Genuine case of Lampington's disease. Delayed, but now moving into the acute stage. Very rare, always fatal. - Had X-rays taken? - Oh, yes. So have I. Wonderful what they can do now, isn't it? Do anything - except get you enough to eat. - Bird. George Bird? - Oh, that's me. Ah, Sit down, - You married, Mr. Bird? - No. Never have been. Living with any close relation? Mother or sister? No, I haven't any close relations. Just live in digs here. - Oh. Some girlfriend perhaps? - Not now, Any special friend? Some - Some old pal. No. I had a great pal once, but he went to Africa. Lonely sort of chap, aren't you, Mr, Bird? Looks like it, doesn't it? But what's all this about? Well, Mr. Bird... according to this X-ray... you're suffering from a very rare complaint... known as Lampington's disease. Come over here a moment. Now then. Have a look at that. What does it do to you, this - Lampington's disease? Ah, now, that's very interesting, and it's a curious thing... that nobody spotted it until about 40 years ago... when Trevor Lampington wrote a monograph on it. You see, between the stomach and the small intestine, there's a - I'm sorry, Doctor, but is it serious? You want the honest truth, don't you, Mr. Bird? - Yes, Doctor. - Well, it is serious, Very serious indeed, Lampington's disease has always proved fatal. No pain, as a rule, you'll be glad to learn. An acute case soon passes into a coma, and-and then- But I feel all right now, Doctor. In fact, my landlady says it must have been the fish. It isn't what you feel, my dear chap, It's what this X-ray tells us, Couldn't be wrong, I suppose? I'm sorry. I - I'm very sorry. Afraid you'll have to prepare yourself, May be a few weeks, Just possibly might be a few months... but that's the limit, And then? Finish? What's your occupation, Mr. Bird? I'm a salesman for the Chanbury Agricultural Implement Company. Saved any money? About 300 or so. And then I've an insurance policy. I suppose the surrender value'll be about 500. Well, if I were in your place, I'd take that 800... walk out of me job and go to Bournemouth or... Torquay or Pinebourne... find a good hotel and enjoy myself while I could. Now, don't forget. There shouldn't be any pain. Just a sort of numbness at first, and then a coma and - and then - You said that before. Well - - Thanks very much. - Not at all. Stiff upper lip. - Feels all right so far. - No, no. I meant keep smiling. How do you keep smiling with a stiff upper lip? I'm so sorry, Mr. Bird. Don't mention it. When you come to think of it, you know, it's a bit thick, isn't it? Couldn't agree with you more, I mean to say... it's going to be all over before I've even got properly started. Don't lean against the window. Well, Bird, you ought to have been over at Binnisford today. - I had to go to the clinic, Mr. Dinsdale. - Now don't go fancying you're ill. - All right. I won't. - Well, off you go then. Off you go. Don't waste time. - I am going, Mr. Dinsdale. - Well, go on, then. Go. But I'm going for good. Here. Bird, don't be foolish. I know the last time you asked me for a rise I couldn't manage it. No. Business wouldn't stand it, you said. Well, we won't quarrel about a few pounds. Not now, we won't. Look, Bird. I'll - I'll raise you to 400. - 450. - No use. - 500. - No go. Too late. Remember that with the next chap. Don't leave it too late, Dinsdale. - Well, so long. - Ah, but where are you going? I don't know yet, but wherever it is, I shan't be trying to sell anybody anything. Don't go, Bird. Listen. I'll make it 550. 600! altogether, I think. The bank will be glad to advise about any investment. I'm not going to invest it. I'm going to spend it. - Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. - Oh, yes, you would. Even you. Now, look. Have you a branch in, um, Pinebourne? Pinebourne? Oh, yes. Yes. We can accommodate you in Pinebourne. Oh, yes, any amount of accommodation in Pinebourne, What, uh, class of hotel had you in mind? Well, what do you think? Oh, something very reasonable, I suppose. - Pinebourne's rather exclusive, you know. - Oh, is it? Oh, yes. In fact, it's very exclusive. - Why, what do they do there? Meet you at the station and tell you to go back? Hmm. The Regal Hotel. - No. That's not what you want. - Why? What's the matter with it? The Regal? Well, although it's rather small, it's very expensive. Select, you know. Well, it can select me for a change. Just you book me a single room at this Regal from tomorrow, please. And I'd better have a railway ticket as well. Certainly. Return, of course? One-way. One moment, sir. Just one moment. It's important. You are just the man I've been looking for. - What, me? - Yes, sir. And believe me, it's a wonderful opportunity. Won't take half a minute to explain. Come inside, sir. Come inside, please. Mind the step, please. What's the idea? You know about that big sale at Lord Fristover's place the other day? Well, I went... and was lucky enough to get some of his late lordship's clothes and suitcases. What do you expect me to do, cheer? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. You are not on my side yet, are you? Not specially. No. You will be, because it's lovely stuff. Savile Row. Cost a fortune now. And I've been looking out for somebody it would fit, and you are him. That's why I called you in. Try one of the jackets on. Just try it. That's all. All right. But I'm only doing it to amuse you. Mm-hmm. Wonderful. Beautiful. Perfect. Don't take my word for it. Have a look at yourself. Over there. See what I mean? Best tailoring in London - in the world. Wear two or three suits like this and a dinner jacket... and you're going to look like somebody. - You'll begin to live. - A bit late. But I see what you mean. - Let's have a look at the rest of that stuff. - Certainly. Thirty-five, five, less three, Three, four, five, six, Sixty-five pounds, 16 shillings. Uh, do you know what I'll do for you? I'll throw this other case in. And that's because I've taken a fancy to you and enjoyed myself. Well, what do you say? - Sixty-five, eh? - I believe I'm balmy, but all right. Sixty-five pounds, and I take this lot and both cases. That's it. Now... believe it or not, but I have done you a big favor this afternoon... and I want you to promise to do me a little favor. - Will you? - I don't know. I might. - Come on. Come on. - All right. I will. Take that mustache off. Doesn't go with this class of stuff. Make a nice all-round job of it. Just to please me, have a neat little hair trim... and get that mustache off. - Will it give me a stiff upper lip? - Hmm, for an hour or two. I need it for longer than that. My dear sir, I'm going to tell you something. You've come into something big. And how do I know? It's the look in your eye. A special look. And what does it tell me? It tells you I've come into something big. Quite so. But how big is it? I don't know. Nobody knows. Or if they do know, they've never told us properly. And I'm leaving for it in the morning. The 15th? The same suite that you had before? Well, I'll speak to Mr. Gambini about it, madam... but I don't think it's possible to reduce our terms. Yes, very busy indeed. Good-bye, madam. - Yes, Mrs. Rockingham? - I had a message from Mr. Gambini... asking me if I'd call at his office. Oh, yes. Uh -Well, I'm afraid you'll have to wait a few minutes, Mrs. Rockingham. Mr. Gambini has Mr. Prescott with him. - A light? - Thank you so much. Thank you. Good afternoon. I have a room booked here. My name's Bird. Oh, yes, Mr. Bird. A single room, wasn't it? Will you sign here, please? Just your name and address will do. I haven't any address, I'm afraid. Not any address? No. I've been traveling about a good deal lately. I like travel, you know. Don't you? I like what I've heard about it. - Oh, I see you've been lucky, Mr. Bird. - Have I? Oh, I see what you mean, I'm sure Mr. Bellinghurst will appreciate your kindness. - Thank you. - Not at all. Uh, Mr. Gambini, Mr. Bird has just arrived. Oh, Mr. Bird. Welcome to our Regal Hotel. I am Gambini, the manager. And if at any time you have the smallest complaint, please come to me. - I hope you will enjoy your stay with us very much. - Thanks. I hope so too. We have many important people stay with us, Mr. Bird. This gentleman you see with me - he is Mr. Prescott... secretary to Mr. Bellinghurst, cabinet minister. - Is he here? - Yes, yes. He spend his convalescence with us here. And many very rich and very important people. You said you wanted to see me, Mr. Gambini. I can't wait all day, you know. Of course, Mrs. Rockingham. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. This way, please. Just a little formality. Miss Mellows, see that everything is very nice for Mr. Bird. Of course, Mr. Gambini. I think you'll find your room very comfortable... but if not, please let me know. Page, take Mr. Bird to 13. I forgot your soap. I'm always forgetting... because the last place I was in, they didn't give soap. I see, - What's the matter? - How do you mean, "What's the matter"? Well, why are we whispering? Oh, I've talked like this for years. Can't help it. I was in Birmingham before this... but I wanted a change. So did I - and I've got one. What's your name? Maggie Craven. This is the poshest place I've been in so far. It's the poshest place I've been in so far too, Maggie. That'll do, Maggie, Nineteen's ringing for you, I bet she is, Never stops, - I'm Mrs. Poole. I'm the housekeeper here. - Oh, yes. Nice job? Well, I don't think we need discuss that... but if you've any complaint to make about your room, please let me know. I shall be in the linen room at the end of the corridor. Thank you. Thank you. Bird, eh? A General Bird used to shoot with my father when I was a girl. He'd an extremely large nose. Has your Mr. Bird a large nose? No, Miss Hatfield. Just an ordinary nose. Oh, probably not the same family. I remember all these Birds had long noses. Beaky Birds we girls used to call them. Cor, you ought to have seen the labels on his bags. Ships, airplanes. Hotels all over. Cairo, India, New York, Los Angeles. Only give me a tenner though for taking him up. That proves he's got plenty of money. - The richer they are, the less they give you, 'cause they don't care what you think of'em, see? - Wonder what he is. - How about secret service? How about working that lift? I say. Mrs. Poole. Yes, Mr. Bird? Something wrong with your room? Oh, no. It's very nice, thank you. It's, um - It's posh, isn't it? In fact, it's the poshest you've been in so far. Please, don't shut that door. I work here, you know... and we're not supposed to shut ourselves in with the guests. Oh, I wasn't thinking about anything like that. I - I just wanted a word with you in private, if you didn't mind. I feel, um - I - I've got to talk to somebody. Well, why me? I'm only the housekeeper here. I shouldn't be in here anyhow. I'm sorry. Look. Don't look at me like that. And look at me as though you expect me to be sorry for you. It's the limit. And if you get any wrong ideas about that, I'll knock you senseless. Well, now that you're here, give me a hand with this, and keep your voice down. By the way- before you start, you might like to know that you're already regarded here... as a sort of mystery man, whatever that may mean. I oughtn't to have come here. It's not my kind of place. What about all this traveling you're supposed to have done? All the traveling I've done is among Midland farmers, trying to sell them farm implements. What's wrong with that? Why didn't you go on with it? - Come into some money? - No. Never earned more than about nine pounds a week. But I'm not married, and I've saved a few hundred. Well, you're not spending your savings here? But why? Wanted a bit of high life? In a way, I suppose. I got into some trouble - uh... heard some bad news. I thought I might as well have a flutter while I had still a chance. What bad news? What sort of trouble? Or don't you want to tell me? - Think I'd better not. - All right. It's nothing to do with me. But you needn't think I'm going to tell anybody about you. But now that you are here, don't creep about looking apologetic. Be a mystery man, or anything else you want to be. And tell 'em what you think. It'll do 'em good. I could never get Sir Herbert to touch a tomato. One of his fads. - I'll take those. - Yes, madam. "Nay, Herbert," I'd say, "Don't be so silly"... but it didn't make a bit of difference, wouldn't touch 'em. Fancy! - What did I tell you? You would come here. - I'm not grumbling, am I, Joe? As good as. I'm grumbling, all right. Look at 'em. Look. About as much life here as the old fourpenny waxworks, We ought to have gone to Brighton like I said. You and your Brighton. So I was wondering if he could be one of the beaky Birds we used to know. One of the girls - Emily, I think it was - went mad and wouldn't come out of the lumber room. What? Oh, yes, I am. You said lumber room. Very fond of lumber rooms. Give you all sorts of ideas. Don't like birds in them though. That's the man, coming in now. - Well turned out. Savile Row. - He looks snooty to me. Possibly. Don't like the look of him myself. If that's the man, not one of the same Birds. The family nose couldn't have dwindled so rapidly. Perhaps he's had an inch or two removed. Reminds me of Sir Herbert's cousin Arthur- the one that went to Australia. - Fancy! - Well, there's somebody new anyway. - Nice-looking sort of chap too, Joe. - Gets me nowhere, does it? Unless that Rockingham piece starts acting a bit more friendly. Expecting your husband back tonight? I'm not sure. Either tonight or early in the morning. I think he ought to be careful. - Why? - These little trips abroad. He isn't the right type. - Too slapdash. - I don't know what you're talking about. Take a card. Any card. Look at it, but don't tell me what it is. You probably think this is one of those trick packs with all the cards alike, but it isn't. Thanks. Your name's Bird, isn't it? I hope you don't mind my doing this. I promised to do some tricks for the boys' club down here on Saturday night, and I'm terribly rusty. Yes. I designed a new undercarriage for aircraft. Trying to enjoy myself, until I can find something else worth doing. Good man. Good man. First sensible remark I've heard today. Good fellow. If you really want to do something else worth doing - Go on. This is like getting back to civilization. You ought to improve on that old subsoiler of yours. Up to a point it's a good job, but it keeps jamming, you know. - Yes, yes, yes. I do know. - It's the blade, of course... but I wouldn't know how to improve it. Mmm. That blade wants thinking out from the beginning, you know. My dear fellow, I'm infinitely obliged to you. Of course the subsoiler's the thing to work on. And we need it badly too. You're a splendid fella. Oh. That's the card you picked. - Mr. Bird? - That's me. My name's Prescott, private secretary to Mr. Bellinghurst... who, as you probably know, is staying here. - Yes, I heard he was. - Well, the minister - Mr. Bellinghurst - wonders if you'd care to join him in a cocktail down in the bar, about a quarter to 8:00. - Are you sure it's me? Bird? - Yes, of course. The minister is always very anxious to talk to people... and gain their impressions of government policy and so on. - By the way, you can be quite frank with him. - All right. I will. A quarter to 8:00 then, in the little cocktail bar. Splendid. Bless you. Really, Miss Fox. I'm surprised at you. - I wasn't thinking, Lady Oswington. - And he wasn't sneezing neither. Hiding his face, if you ask me. Very peculiar. Hmph. Very peculiar indeed. What do I do about this? Come here. Can't look after yourself, can you? Seems like it. I'm sorry. Oh, don't apologize. How are you getting on? Well, I've started an inventor reinventing... and I've just been asked to have a drink with a cabinet minister. - How's that? - All right, so far. There. Thank you very much, Mrs. Poole. Very kind. No, it isn't very kind of me. I like doing it. - And don't look at me like that. - Like what? Like a little lost dog or something. In a minute you'll have me - Oh, I wish you'd tell me what's wrong. All right. Off you go, and don't let anybody see you. - What can I get you? - A white lady for me, please. Ah, Mr, Bird, - White lady and a double martini, George. - Yes, sir, All right, Joe. You've seen her now. No harm in looking, is there? What have I gotta do so you get to know her? Give her chloroform? Who wanted to come here? We're half a mile out of our depth. That's what we are. Well, now, Mr. Bird, what do you really think about us? - You're doing all right. That's what we want to hear, eh, Prescott? Doing all right. Of course we are. But you're making one or two very bad mistakes. Oh, we are, eh? Well, just tell me one of them. Do you really want to know, Mr. Bellinghurst, or are we just chattering? No. Go on, my dear chap. Tell me. We make machinery and send it abroad, eh? - Certainly. Must have exports. - Yes, quite. Yes, but a lot of that machinery will be used to... make the goods we want to sell people abroad. In the meantime, we aren't making enough machinery to improve our own agriculture here - to grow more food for ourselves, which is the most important thing of all, - That's what you think, eh? - I don't think, I know, I could show you 200 farms in one county that are crying out for more machinery- for combine harvesters, drying plants, muck-spreaders, new disc harrows. I'm sorry, Minister, but you've an engagement immediately after dinner. Yes, we'll have to go in. I want some more information from you, Mr. Bird. Tomorrow, perhaps. So don't run away or drop dead. Something there I might use, you know, Prescott. - Just what I was thinking, Minister. - Make a note to get hold of that chap as soon as I've an hour to spare. - Up in my room, tomorrow, or the day after. - Yes, Minister. Of course. Yes, certainly I will. Thank you. Won't you join us? And I'm in the chair. So what will you have, Mr. Bird? Double martini? A glass of beer, thank you. - You don't mean it? - Yes, I do. I always mean what I say. - But how exciting. - Isn't it? But that means, if someone asks you a question, you've got to give them a truthful answer. Well, what's wrong with that? Why shouldn't we tell the truth to each other? Because, for one thing, most of us couldn't take it. - Could you? - I've had to. What are you thinking about? The truth, remember? I was thinking that if I'd seen you outside somewhere... looking like that... I'd have thought you were out of some other world, And yet here you are, as real as I am. You know, there's something rather frightening about you, Mr. Bird. Oh, dear. All right, Joe Clarence. If you want to get to know her as bad as all that... why don't you go across and introduce yourself? That's just what I would do, if we was anywhere human, not in a stuffed-shirt dump like this. Don't be silly. What's the difference? They can't eat you, can they? And talking about eating, it'll be dinnertime in a minute. So come on, Joe. Make up your mind. All right. I'll have a bash at it. Follow me, girl, and keep your fingers crossed. Excuse me. Uh, you're the very spit of a bloke I met up at Haringey. Sorry, I've never been there. There you are, Joe. What did I tell you? You and your Haringey. - All right. I made a mistake. - And it doesn't matter, Mr. - - Uh, Clarence. Joe Clarence. - We've met now, haven't we? - That's right, Mr. Bird. - So join the party. That's what I wanted to hear the whole week. - You'll all have one with me. George. - Yes, sir. - Let's enjoy our miserable selves. You know why, chum? - No, I'll buy it. 'Cause we're a long time dead. Excuse me. I've just remembered something. Where now would you like me to put you, sir? - Put me? - For dinner, sir, - What's the idea? - Finishing a job. That's all. - Wake you up, did we? - Nearly knocked me out of bed. Well, you've gotta get up sometime, chum, We can't all be the idle rich, you know, We don't get our lay-in till Saturday. - I - I'm sorry about all this noise. - It's a bit thick, you know. Well, of course it is horrible. But, you see, Mr. Bird... there is one of our best clients who stay here often long time. He arrange with me to make some changes in his sitting room. Today he come back, so we must finish quick, eh? You know this gentleman, Sir Robert Kyle? Very important gentleman from Scotland. Very, very rich. Millionaire. From "sheeps. " - Sheep? - No, no. Big "sheeps" - to go in the water. Mr. Bird, I ask the waiter to bring you a very nice breakfast, especially for you. Mmm. So I got this commercial type to give me a lift from Southampton. About all I did get on this trip. No, the luck's out, darling. I wish you wouldn't do that in here. We still have a bathroom. Only just, I imagine. Gambini sent for me yesterday. I had to swear you'd pay him as soon as you got back. Well, I can't, of course. It's not that that's worrying me. You'd better tell me, hadn't you, Derek? Hmm. No. I'd better not. But if you know how to raise about 300 like lightning and with no security... now is the time to tell me how it's done. No, uh, diamond necklaces tucked away anywhere? Don't be silly. Everything I had that was worth selling is gone. Hmm. Anybody new in the pub? Yes. A man called Bird, who rather likes me. Though he makes me feel uncomfortable. I can't think why. - Rich type? - Could be. It's hard to say. I can't make him out. - Well, a bird in the hand - - Not funny. Perhaps not. But if you knew as much as I do, pretty heroic. Oh, well. I'll have a shot at Wrexham. If that's no go, I'll have a last try at one or two old comrades in town. Nice people we're turning into. Squadron Leader Derek Rockingham, D.F.C. Sheila, only daughter of Admiral Brenton. - And now, look at us. - Now listen, poppet, - I won't. - Oh, yes, you will. Well, I'm sorry, madam, but it's a strict rule with the management... that no young children are allowed. I think it's a shame too. I'd rather have children and not stay here. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good-bye. - Nice place you have here. If you'd like to talk to your friends about it, we have a small handbook I could give you. No, thank you. As a matter of fact, I was wondering if a friend of mine was staying here. - Is his name Smith or Robinson? - Smart girl, aren't you? - Ministry of Food? - Good Lord, no. Do I look like a snooper? - Yes, I think you do, rather. - Well, I'm not. But as a favor- purely as a favor, mind you - would you allow me to glance through your register? If you want any information, you better ask the manager, Mr. Gambini. Gambini, eh? Not perhaps what I want. - What about you? - It's no good. Don't know enough about the customers, and don't care. Just waiting for a young man in Kenya to send for me. Oh, I see. Well, good luck. There's a Mrs. Poole here, isn't there? Mrs. Poole's the housekeeper. Do you know her? I used to know her husband. I'd like to have a word with her. Could you, uh, fix it? Just wait over there, my dear Holmes, will you? Of course. But the name's Wilton. You know, what you did last night made all the difference to him. Didn't it, Joe? It did. And listen, George, old son, I'd like to do you a favor. - Make you a nice little packet, if you're interested. - I might be, Joe. - Mr. Bird. - Excuse me. Might be me she's after really. Eh? - Then again, it might not. - Come on. You weren't going out with those people, were you? - Yes. Putting. Why not? - Common as dirt. So am I. Perhaps we all are. You'd better join us. Oh, all right. But I'd like to talk to you alone sometime. - I can give you a quarter of an hour. - Thanks. Mr. Holmes. You'll find her at the end of the landing on the second floor. The name's on the door. Much obliged. But we're not altogether strangers. Frank and I were in "C" Division and up at Hendon together. You've probably heard him mention me. Yes, I remember. - But what's it all about anyhow? - Currency smuggling. What do you know about this chap Bird? - Bird? - Yes. Well, the smart clothes he wears are secondhand. They belonged to Lord Fristover, who lived at Chanbury in the Midlands. Two of his shirts were bought at a shop in Chanbury. So, I think he comes from Chanbury. Yes, but what's he doing here? - Spending his savings to see life. Oh, just when I thought I needn't worry about people any longer... I have to start worrying about this chump. Just because he has a helpless look and I don't know what it means... I have to start getting upset and trying to help- it's idiotic. I thought you women liked worrying about somebody. Oh, I hate this "you women" stuff. But if you must know, if we don't worry, then we feel only half alive... and if we do worry, then we worry and worry and - Oh, I thought I had more sense. Well, I'm glad you haven't. Can you tell me anything about the Rockinghams? Good-looking, nice clothes, plenty of charm... but he can't pay his bill and might be getting into mischief. Hmm. Well, I may need your help again later on. Do you mind? - Not at all. I'll do all I can to help you. - Thank you. Good-bye. The answer is no. Lovely morning. I'm always fond of early autumn. I've, uh, put up one or two blacks lately. Things are looking pretty nasty. I'm not surprised. In fact, I told Sheila yesterday- you ought to be more careful. Sheila, eh? By the way, I wouldn't make any mistake there, if I were you, Wrexham. She's still very devoted to me. Strange but true. - What about this fellow Bird? - I shouldn't count on anything there. Everybody seems impressed except me. I think he's a counterjumper who took a lucky dip in a football pool. Well, he might be worth trying. I think I'll run up to town first and see if I can raise anything. Poor old Derek. He's rather desperate just now, poor lamb, trying to raise some money. - Has he tried everything? - Yes. Absolutely everything. Even working? Isn't that rather a beastly remark? It depends how you feel about work. I've got a very hot tip on a horse. Get you tens on it. - All you gotta do is stick on 50 quid, same as me. - And you're not telling me anything about it? Can't, chum, 'cause I promised. So, you gotta make up your mind, George. Either I'm doing you a favor, or I'm playing a con game. Either you trust me, or you don't. All right, Joe. I trust you. Put 50 on for me. That's the talk, Georgie. I was just stealing a cutting for my garden. I always do, wherever I go. - My mother always did. - Ah, thank you, Mr. Bird. When my husband, Sir Herbert, was alive, we kept 10 gardeners. - Fancy. - Now I've only three. And I've only one. And he's even older than I am. Eighty, if a day, the poor old thing. Mr. Bird seems a very unhappy young man. Have you noticed it? - I can't say I have. - Well, I have. But then they all are now. They try to be sane in a mad world... while, when I was a girl, we tried to be mad in a sane world. - So much more satisfactory, don't you think? Been doing some work on our subsoiler blade, old man. - Our subsoiler blade? - Yes. I want you to come in with me. Take a look at this. There's a proposition there I think might interest you. Don't want to rush you, but look it over as soon as you can. What are you doing this afternoon? Playing croquet with Mrs. Rockingham, Miss Hatfield and you. I've forgotten how to play croquet. I've never played in my life. Good shot, partner. So, as far as I can see, that starts at a fat salary, plus commission. - That's all. - Not good enough? Not good enough? A week ago, I'd - - Well, what about a week ago? - Your turn, Mr, Bird, What do I do now? You put your ball through that hoop, partner. - Though it's about a hundred-to-one you can't. - You never know these days. You've done it! You're too good for us, Mr. Bird. - How do you do it? - Luck. Just luck. Your go, Mrs. Rockingham. I've had a word from old Kyle. He's interested in our proposition. He may be able to help us with the metal too. Now, that blade ought to be lighter, don't you think? - Yes. And thinner- if you can make it just as strong. - I'm onto that, my dear fellow. Don't stand gossiping there. No, no, partner. Keen as mustard. - Silly game, this. Make it rain, will you? - Anything to oblige. Rain, please. Oh! Oh. Thank you. - What a horrible cigarette case. - I'm a horrible man. Do you know anything about hands? No. I have a cousin who specializes in them. She looks at hands more than faces. I don't really observe anything very much. I'm really in a dream half the time. Pleasant dream? Not lately. We were going to talk about me, weren't we? - Yes. - Well, if you don't mind, I think we won't. I'm sorry. I don't like your cigarettes. - They're the cheapest I can find. - Cheap things are a mistake. It's a bigger mistake to buy things you can't afford. Why do you say things like that to me and then smile like that? I'm probably trying to do everything I can to impress you. Kiss me. No? No. I'm sorry. I must still be in love with Derek. What a nuisance. Well, say something. All right, then. Get out of this, and start living a real life somewhere while there's still time. I don't think I want to listen to this. No, but for once you're going to do something you don't want to do. And I say start living a real life. Your last chance may be slipping away. If you still want your husband, then take him away and make him into something. If he isn't worth it, then clear out yourself, before it's too late. - Mind your own damn business. - Certainly. I only wish someone had talked to me like that 10 years ago - five years ago. - I'm going. - You'll get wet. I don't care if I drown. Why would you live with this trash? Look at this! There's no honest workmanship in that, You might as well have asked a couple of schoolgirls to do the job... with cardboard and a poke of tin tacks, Please, Sir Robert, I tell you. I ask for the best workmen, the best material, especially for you. A laddie with a wee fretwork set could have done better. I don't know what the country's coming to when the likes of that passes for a job of work. Huh! Man, Gambini, they may swindle you, but they won't get away with tha' while I'm about the place. I say. Well, my dear sir, and what might you be wanting? Let me know if you're going right through that wall... because I happen to live on the other side. I asked for some alterations to be made here. I know, I heard about them, Well, look what they've given me, That's what you get nowadays. No a decent tradesman left. Just fellas hanging around, waiting for cups of tea. Now be fair. Look at the rotten stuff these chaps had to use. - What's your name, sir? - Bird. And you're Sir Robert Kyle. I've heard of you. Very likely. But let me tell you... that I was working on the Clyde with these two hands before you were born. - Maybe, but you had good stuff to work with. - Ah, I did. And these chaps hadn't. They had to take what they could get. We've had two world wars and some nasty knocks... since you worked with your hands, Sir Robert. Hello, hello! Welcome back, Sir Robert. Hello, Bird. You've got a fierce look in your eye. You two been quarreling? Not at all, Eh, Mr, Bird? - Certainly not. Just a little argument. I tell you, Mr. Bird, I am very grateful for this way you talk to Sir Robert Kyle. To everyone who come here I say it is very nice to have them staying with us... but that is one big lie. But with you is honest truth, Mr. Bird. And all of the time you remind me of my dear brother. - There's something about you, Mr. Bird. - Really? And where is your brother now, Mr. Gambini? He's dead, my brother. - Get wet this afternoon? - A bit. Me and Daisy got properly soaked. Got a nice bit of news for you, Georgie boy. It all comes of trusting a bloke with a mug like mine. I couldn't get us tens on that horse. Got eights. She romped home. Left 'em standing like I was told she would. Your share's 400 quid. - 400 quid? - You'll have it in the morning, old son. But that's no reason why we don't celebrate tonight. See you in the bar, eh? I'm holding up the dinner, sir, because they're all in the bar... which is like Klondike in the gold rush this night. Some nights they all drink like fishes. Other nights nobody drinks. And why this should be I cannot tell, you cannot tell. This'll be a great night for getting rid of a few portions of the old game pie... which has been weighing upon us like the sorrows of the world. My friend, of some things it is better not to speak. I shall eat a little soup and cold chicken in my room... and try to listen to La Scala di Milano on the radio. Come on, everybody. Drink up. Laugh and be happy. This is my lucky day and you're all in it. Him and his lucky days. And these are 10 bob a time too, George. They're not worth it, Daisy. Your friend Bird keeps giving you some queer looks. - Can't understand how he takes everybody in. - Can't you? I think he's rather sweet. Probably won a few hundreds in a football pool... and everybody thinks he's somebody mysterious and wonderful. - Eh, Sheila? - I don't know and I don't care. I'm worried about Derek. Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir, but don't forget the Pinebourne Club. Ring up and tell 'em I'll be a few minutes late. Delayed by urgent business. Never does any harm, eh, Sir Robert? No, not when they won't vote for you anyway. And they won't, you know. My husband, Sir Herbert, always said champagne cocktails did you more harm than good. Nonsense! What did you say? I said nonsense, Lady Os - Oswington. - Absolute nonsense. Oi, chum, join in. Don't be shy. Try one of these. Right-o, chum. - Cheers. - Cheers. Enjoying yourself, George? No. Can't really say I am, Daisy. And it's about time I started. Joe'll want you to play poker tonight. Always does, old pie can. And you'll have to play too, George, or Joe'll be put out. Cards. I'll have three cards, please. - One, two, three. - Thank you. - One. - One for you, two for me. I'll check the bet. Ten. All right, Georgie. Ten, and another 10. Mmm. I'm away. Ten... and 20 more. Ooh. Well - All right, Georgie, what have you got? - Heavens! A royal flush! Look at that. A bloody full house. All right, gents, that's penalties. Another two pound each. - You're a very lucky man, Mr, Bird, - How do you do it, boy? I don't know, Joe. I just don't know. - Must we go on? - Of course we must. Eh, boys? - Can't stop when you're winning, Bird, old boy. - All right. Whose deal is it? - My deal. - Have to get a wheelbarrow for this lot. I'm sorry, Sheila. It's just as bad as it can be. - We've had it. - What do you mean? What's happened? Something's gone wrong. There's been a leak somewhere. Binney's in a flap. Says our only chance is for him to clear out. He's broke too, and - Hold it. We've got company. - Mr. Rockingham? - That's me. But I've had a long day and I don't feel like a cheery chat. I'll try not to keep it too long. Just a few questions. - Perhaps you'd like to leave us. - I'd rather not, if you don't mind. Mr. Rockingham, yesterday you were in Paris. I was. Last week, on the 9th to be exact, you were in Brussels. On the 3rd you crossed to the Hook. A few days before that you were also in Paris. I daresay. Not quite sure about the dates, but that's more or less right, I imagine. - Fond of travel, aren't you? - No. Not this kind, anyhow. But you see, Inspector, I need a job. I see. Know a man called Binney? Yes, slightly. Used to run into him here and there. Not lately, though. - Not lately, eh? - That's what I said. What I say is that you were having a drink with him... this afternoon at a quarter to 3:00 in the Regent bar. Well, what if I was? - Derek. - It's all right, Mrs. Rockingham. While your husband's thinking it over I'll talk to you. We believe that Binney and one or two others have started a currency smuggling racket. It looks as if your husband's been giving them some help, And don't imagine this currency smuggling... is like trying to slip a few pairs of stockings past the customs. It's not. It's a dirty game. Talk to me. My wife knows nothing about this. There is something to know then. Look, you've got a first-class war record. You can leave that out. They seem to, anyhow, when the jobs are going. Don't forget that. I've got a job. Supposed to be good where I come from, and it took me 15 years to work up to it. But I couldn't afford to have a whiskey and soda and sandwiches in this hotel. - I can't either. - No. And I don't think that's so funny because I know you can't. But I'd rather go and dig ditches than do what you're doing - trying to make easy money stooging for rats like Binney. Like to tell me anything? All right, I'll see you in the morning. Think it over. - Good night, Mrs. Rockingham. - Good night. Oh, Derek, how could you? I know. I've been a stupid ape. But there's no time for all that. If only I could find a way of paying the bill, we'd leave right now. If I get 100 quid to Binney by morning - Oh, if, if, if. What's the good of talking that way? Isn't there anybody here who could give us a break? If there isn't, I'm for it. I must phone a fellow and let him know what's happening. May take time though. Going upstairs? No, I couldn't. I'm going outside. I must think. - Good night. Thanks for the game. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, sir. Good night, Mrs. Clarence. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Good night. Sleep well. Ooh, that's a nice little packet, isn't it? Listen, George, old cock, I'd like to talk some business. Now, look, I've got six fish restaurants, three fun arcades and two holiday camps... and I'm starting two more. Why don't you come in with me, Georgie? You and me could get on. You're one of those lucky boys. I spotted it right off. You don't have to put any money up, but you can if you like, Thanks, Joe... but it's no use. I have to go away soon. Must you go? - Looks like it, - Long way? A long way, Joe. And I'm sorry, but I shan't be coming back. What's the matter, old son? Nothing. Feel a bit muzzy. I'll go outside and get some fresh air. - Good night, Georgie. - Good night, Daisy. Thanks for the game. - Oh, it's you. - Yes, it's me. It would have to be you, wouldn't it? Needn't be. I can go. No, I didn't mean it like that. You're the one person here who would probably help us. We're in a terrible mess. But after the way I behaved this afternoon, you're the one person I feel I oughtn't to ask. I don't agree. I gave you some advice unasked for... and people who give advice should be prepared to give some help too. What do I do? It's desperately urgent. Then we must pay our bill here. There's about a hundred here. I'll look after the bill in the morning. - But can you - - Yes, I can. I must have known from the first somehow you were going to save us. There was always something about you. Yes, but it's urgent. Rockingham. Derek Rockingham. Oh, very well! Derek! Darling, it's all right. Our troubles are over. George has just lent us the money. And he'll pay our hotel bill tomorrow. My dear chap, this is terrific. Are you sure you can spare it? - God knows when I'll be able to pay you back. - I'm not expecting to be paid back. Oh, no, I say, this is one time when I really-Well - I mean, you have to find a man to pay him back. And I'll be hard to find. Good night. Good luck. Oh, but what about a drink or something? No, thanks. Good night. Rum bloke. Darling, you're shivering. Let's go in. Thought you'd still be playing poker, Winning too, weren't you? How do you know? Well, the waiter who brought your drinks wasn't exactly blind, deaf and dumb, you know. What'd you do with the winnings? Give them away? - Yes. - Sheila Rockingham. I'll bet she wheedled them out of you. Have you got to be so hard all the time? Yes. And don't start pawing me about just because you've had a few drinks. It wasn't like that. I can see now you're the sort of woman a chap would like to take hold of... but it wasn't like that. What was it like then? It's late. I feel miserable. Not close to anyone. On my own, if you know what I mean. Oh, no, I wouldn't know what you meant. And I suddenly thought you were the one I knew best. Well, I'm sorry I spoke like that to you. - It's all right. - No, it isn't all right. And nothing's all right about you, churning my feelings up like this. Why don't you get away from here? Go away and make yourself into something. Because I don't know how to make myself into something in the graveyard. You aren't leaving, are you? Yes. At least I think so. - Well, nobody told me. - I haven't told anybody yet. - Going home? - No. - Going to some other hotel? - I don't know. - What are the other hotels here? - The biggest is the Grand. Posh? Posh-ish. Much bigger than this. Dancing there. Well, I'll go and see what they can do for me. Now you pop off, Maggie. What's the matter with everybody this morning? All creating. That Miss Fox crying because Lady Whosit's gone and sacked her. Fair old stinker. Maggie, ask Miss Fox if she would come and have a word with me here. Okeydokey. Come in. - Oh, Mr. Bird, it's so good of you. - I haven't done anything yet. Miss Fox, is it true Lady Oswington's dismissed you? After five years as her companion, Mr. Bird. It was all so sudden and so - so - so brutal. Just because of last night. What will you do now, Miss Fox? I don't know, I'm sure, Mr. Bird. What would you like to do, if you could do it? Sometimes my cousin and I have talked about opening a little gift shop. Giftee Shoppee, I think we'd call it. You know, just a quaint, friendly little place... but though she has a little money of her own I'm afraid I haven't any. How much would you want to start it? Oh, no, Mr. Bird. It's very kind, but I really couldn't accept such - I'll lend it to you then. You can pay it back sometime, though it doesn't matter. Oh, Mr. Bird, but could you really? Miss Fox! Miss Fox! This is your chance. Take it. Miss Fox, where are you? Don't answer. Or tell her to go to blazes. Miss Fox, where are you? I'm here, Lady Oswington. Miss Fox, just this once I'll overlook your horrible behavior. - Oh, thank you, Lady Oswington. - But never again, mind. Oh, yes, Lady Oswington. I quite understand. Well, I don't. I'd rather have anything, even a Giftee Shoppee. I wasn't aware that anybody asked for your opinion, Mr. Bird. Come along, Miss Fox. I don't know what Sir Herbert would have thought. I'd better ask Sir Herbert when I see him. It shouldn't be long now. Oi! Anybody there? You're wasting your breath, chum, I pulled 'em all out, - Pulled who out? - Cooks, waiters, chambermaids, receptionists. The whole issue. On strike. Got a light? Yes, they're all out. Neat job. Came down from Amalgamated Unions yesterday, pulled them all out... and now you couldn't get a glass of hot water anywhere. - You staying in Pinebourne? - I'm at the Regal. - Thought of coming here. - Regal, eh? I'm pulling them out after tea. Twelve-hour sympathetic strike. You won't get a sausage anywhere tonight, chum. - Well, I'm a busy man. Cheerio. - Cheerio. I've just left a 15-stone woman who'll get no food for the next 24 hours. That'll do her more good than I can. Can I give you a lift? I've got a car outside. Oh, thanks very much. - Tried to golf here yet? - No, I don't play golf. You don't, eh? What do you do then? Oh, just live for pleasure. I hope you don't mind me asking you, Doctor... but can you tell me anything about Lampington's disease? Shouldn't have thought you'd heard of that. Very rare, you know. Of course, old Trevor Lampington's still alive... but you don't hear very much about him these days. Lampington. Sir Trevor Lampington. Oh, yes, Sir Trevor, We're expecting you, If you wouldn't mind signing the register. Page, room 10. I'm here to spend the night with my old friend, Sir Robert Kyle. Really, Sir Trevor? Thank you. Mmm. Quite a handsome young woman. - Thank you, Sir, Trevor. - But you'll have to watch those kidneys. Sir Trevor, it's a very great pleasure to have you staying with us. - Indeed? Who are you? - I'm Gambini, the manager of this hotel. Sir Robert has told me of you... and I arranged to make for you tonight a very special, nice dinner. Oh? What would that be? Some nice hors d'oeuvres, a little smoked salmon, some hot lobster. Poison! All you will make for me would be a very special, nice bowl of bread and milk. Oil I'm just warning you, chum. If you give him this special, nice dinner tonight, you'll have to cook it and serve it yourself. I don't know you. I don't talk to you. - Union member? - Yes. Twelve-hour sympathetic strike. Starts at 5:00 this afternoon. You pass the word round the rest of you in front and I'll go round the kitchens. - I'm pulling everybody out. - All right, Napolon, when do we take Asia? Mrs. Rockingham. Oh, bless you for this. You'll never know what it means to me. I couldn't sleep a wink last night. What are you doing? I've stopped it just to talk to you quietly for a minute. You see, I couldn't thank you properly last night. - Oh, that's all right. - No, it isn't. I've been a pig, and you're heaven. - Ringing for the lift? - Looks like it, doesn't it? - Haven't seen Mr. Bird, have you? - I haven't seen Bird, and I don't want to see Bird. I'm tired of all this fuss you people are making about Bird. I'm so sorry. I can't think what can have happened. Not very efficient, is it, for a place of this kind. Some of us are still busy men, even if we are supposed to be recuperating. And some of us have to keep on being busy even without recuperating. Oh, it's coming up now. Ah, Mr. Bird! See you later. In a hurry now. Mr. Bird, you were complaining about your window rattling. - Oh, was I? - So I understood. I brought you some wedges. This afternoon then? - What's all this about the window? - Oh, shut up. I must have an excuse to talk to you, and the laundress is in the linen room. Well, Mr. Bird, I'm afraid there's only one thing I can do about these windows... and that's to wedge them, so I brought some wedges. I see. Thanks very much, Mrs. Poole. I wanted to give you a chance to explain what you said last night. You upset me terribly. - I didn't sleep a wink. - Sorry. I... wouldn't take any notice of that. I didn't mean to be angry with you. I'm so sorry. But there's no need to talk about graveyards. Don't take any notice of that. I just got carried away. - I think that's better. Don't you, Mr. Bird? - What? Oh, I think so, Mrs. Poole, so long as it doesn't rattle, of course. I don't understand you. What is the matter with you? I'll tell you what's the matter with me. For years -years - nothing happened. I couldn't get anywhere. Win over a hundred at poker, get offered big, fancy jobs... shares in subsoilers, run holiday camps, and none of it's any good to me. Oh, shh. Be quiet. And when I try to tell somebody about it, I have to pretend that a window is rattling. Please, be quiet. Look. I've got the afternoon off... and we could go out together and you can tell me properly. I can't this afternoon. I promised to go a walk. - With that Rockingham girl? - Yes. Then you're even sillier than I thought you were. Now, Mr. Bird, that ought to be all right. Waiter! I'll have another cake. Have 'em all, ma'am. - Waiter, - Waiter! - Waiter. - Waiter! - W-W-Waiter. Waiter? I want somebody to help Williamson with his plan... for the National Agricultural Machinery Board. - You do? - I do. Unless I can find someone at once, Pennington will push one of his backroom boys in, as usual. - And we've had enough of that. - Pennington? Mm-hmm. This might look good too, promoting a practical man like yourself... one of the people who have been doing the job. You mean - I mean I'm offering you an appointment on the National Agricultural Machinery Board. Sorry. Can't take it. - Did you ring for some more tea, Prescott? - Yes, Minister, but I'll ring again. This isn't a political appointment, Mr. Bird. You'll notice that I haven't asked your opinion of us as a government, eh? - No, you haven't, have you? - But I can tell you this, Mr. Bird - we're the only people who could keep this country going at the present time. If it wasn't for us and the confidence of the people in our policy... you'd have rising prices, industrial disputes, strikes all over the place. - What about that tea, Prescott? - Oh, I've just remembered. You won't get any more tea. They all went on strike at 5:00. Excuse me. - Go on, speak to them. - Shall I? Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bird will now say a few words. Mr. Bird. I only wanted to say, if we've nobody to look after us tonight... then we'd better look after ourselves. Won't do us any harm. So let's get together and divide the jobs between us. Good old George, I'll run the bar, Oh, no, you won't. You and your bar. And if I get some help in the kitchen, then tonight I, Gambini, will cook the dinner. There you are. It's all fixed. Then I put it into casserole. Put in the onions and fry the bacon. Some herbs. Pieces of rabbit. And let it simmer three-quarters of an hour. And then I put it potatoes, two glasses of white wine. Again it simmers. Then I put in the seasoning. And then lapin en gibelotte, Just good cooking and you will say it is wonderful. Everybody hard at it, eh? Splendid. Splendid. That's the spirit, eh? Yep, too many blinking knives and forks in this caper, if you ask me. All goes down the same way too, don't it? Still, when you gotta lay 'em out like this, it makes you think. All gotta be washed up too. Oh, tables being laid. All pulling together, eh? That's the spirit. Great show. All pulling together. That's right. All pulling together. What's he pulling, except faces? Next time I'm gonna be one of them blokes. "Great show. That's the spirit! Ha-ha-ha!" Terrible amount of waste labor in this sort of thing. Oughtn't to be difficult to invent a mechanical loading device. I'm sure I look nicer than a mechanical loading device. - Oh, I think it is. - Everyone in full production, Bird? - All but a few who'll turn up for dinner though. I almost feel like kissing you again. - Hasn't anybody ever said that to you before? - No. Never. Poor darling. But why? What have you been doing all your life? I don't know. Just getting up, working, reading the paper, smoking, going to bed. Like millions of other chaps. You'd be surprised. I'm surprised what girls go and miss. Now, that's enough. Go on. Scoot. Regal Hotel. Speak up. Don't mumble. Do we what? Of course we take young children. What are their names? Oh, but how sweet. Especially Dulcibella. I had a cousin - or rather, a second cousin, one of the Northumberland Blackmores - she was a Dulcibella. She ran away with a Greek sea captain. I can't imagine why. Noise? Why shouldn't young children make noise? And if I'm here I'll make a noise with them. Good-bye! Good afternoon. Do you want a room here? No. I've got a room here. What are you doing here? Answering the telephone. What do you think I'm doing, riding a bicycle? Oh, it's monstrous. You're much too old to be doing such work. And you're too old to stand there talking nonsense. Run away and make yourself useful. Silly old duffer. Time we had a wet, even if we have to serve ourselves. Good evening, gentlemen. Come in. The bar's open. Turned a bit colder, hasn't it? Don't breathe on those glasses! Most people crumble the bread into the milk. And in this, as in so many other matters, most people are wrong. The pieces of bread - not too large, not too small - should be placed in the bowl... and the milk poured over the bread. A pinch of sugar is added. And then what have you got? A poor basin of slops instead of a good dinner. Aye, a good dinner. A capital dinner, thanks to our friend Gambini. Hear! Hear! Aye, and to whoever it was among us who had the splendid notion... that instead of sitting down and girning we should all turn to and help ourselves. - Hear! Hear! Well, I think we've all shown the proper spirit, pulling together. Oh, no, you don't. Bird arranged all this. Come on, Georgie boy. - Up you come. You're the boy we want. Oh, our friend Mr. Bird, was it? Then I call upon him for a few remarks. Thanks very much. I think several of us had the same idea at the same time... so I don't deserve any special thanks, though I'd like to say this - I don't know why most of you came here, but I know that I came here to enjoy myself. It was a sort of last chance. Somehow I didn't enjoy myself, not until tonight. But tonight's been different. I don't mean to say we'd like it every night - No, and don't forget, Georgie boy, we still gotta do the washing up! We haven't just passed the time. We have... filled it with something good. And there's a lot to be said for that because we don't know how much time we have left, do we? No, uh... all I wanted to say was... don't thank me. Let me thank you... all of you, for tonight. You gave m - If you're interested, Sir Robert, it's all set. I can design a new subsoiler for you. And my group can manufacture them. But they've still got to be marketed by a man that knows the business. And there's the man. He started me on the idea, and he's the man to sell the result. What do you say to that, Mr. Birdie? Much obliged, but it's no use bothering about me. You're just wasting your time. I must say I'm surprised and disappointed in you, Mr. Bird. About to say the same, old man. It's a wonderful idea and you'll have nothing to do with it. Aye. It's a great chance to benefit not only yourself and us, but the whole nation. But you're like so many others nowadays - you'd rather idle and amuse yourself. So you won't take it, eh? - It's not that I won't. I can't. - Ahh, In my young days, my dear young man, there was no such word as "can't" in my vocabulary. Oh, what's the use? Look, I can't take this job or any of the other jobs I've been offered... because quite soon I'm going to die. You're what? Die. Pass on. - Kick the bucket. - But - For years and years I go on and on and nobody offers me a sausage. Then when I'm going to die, I come here, and everybody offers me everything on a plate. Money. Travel. Jobs. Influence. Love and kisses. Just because I'm going to die. One moment, my friend. What might you be going to die of? You look healthy enough to me. If you must know, I'm going to die of Lampington's disease. Lampington's disease? Do you know who you're talking to? Uh, Sir- Sir Trevor Lampington, who discovered Lampington's disease... and if you've got Lampington's disease... I'm in the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Are you quite sure? That you're suffering from Lampington's disease. Mrs. Poole! Mrs. Poole! Shh! Don't make such a noise! It's all been a mistake! I'm not going to die! - Nice morning, - Beautiful morning. Can I speak to Mr. Clarence from here, please? Twenty-five. Mr. Bird to speak to Mr. Clarence, please. - You look different, Mr. Bird. - I am. I'm happy. Well, don't be too happy. There's a something somewhere that doesn't like it and interferes. - Nonsense. - Here he is. Joe, something tremendous has happened. I must get back to Chanbury for an hour or so... and I wondered if I could borrow your car for the day. Then I could be back here by teatime. Oh, bless you. And you. My tank's nearly full. What time will you be back? - Not later than 6:00, even if I take it easy. - Starter's down there. Gears on the right. Well, seems a bit nippy. - I'll say so long, George. - Thanks, Joe. - See you tonight, old son? - That's right! Hello. Came down with the milk. I say, you're not leaving us, are you? - Only for the day. - Good. See you tonight then. I fixed everything, thanks to you, Bird. I won't forget it. You pop up and see Sheila. I must go. All right, driver. Bye-bye. Your call to Chanbury, Sir Trevor. Will you take it in the box? Thank you. Is that Dr. Pevensey? Yes, I gather you're a busy man. In fact, so busy that it's just about 50-to-1 that somebody there has been looking... at the wrong set of X-ray plates. This is Lampington. Sir Trevor Lampington. Lampington, the man whose disease you've been making so free with lately. Now, stop being busy for a moment and listen to me. - I told Bird it was thanks to him. - You don't have to tell me that. - What happened in town? - Binney's cleared out. Got a quick passage somewhere with what I gave him. It's all right now. Nothing further to worry about. - Yes, there is. - Didn't Bird pay the bill after all? Yes. That's not what I mean, Derek. This is the last time. Either we pay our way and go straight, or- or I'm through. I love you. Sometimes I wish I didn't. But if you want me to stay with you... there must be no more of this sponging and dodging and lying. I promise. Though I may need a little help. - I'll do my best. - We could leave here today. No. Tomorrow. I want to see Bird again, just once. I want him to feel that what he did wasn't useless. Good girl. Lovely day for the road. That's right, Cecil. It's a lovely day. I'd like to take a lovely lorry out on a lovely day like this. Go on, enjoy yourself, Cecil. That's just what I intend to do, Noel. There's no doubt about it. The old dinosaur was quite right. I must have been looking at the wrong set of plates. I remember now, Doctor, There was another man who looked terribly ill, called, um... Burden. Oh! The chap who was so indignant when I told him there was nothing the matter with him. Those must have been Bird's plates. After what I told Bird, I believe he sold up and cleared out. - Probably a good thing for us he did. - Well, that's something. About the last man I'd like to see walking in here. Come along. Let's get on. Who's next? Next, please. - Well? - Quite well, thank you. And Bird is the name. - And Bird is his name and he's not rich at all? - No, just like us. Now do you understand, Joe? Poor George thought he had only a few weeks more to live. So he couldn't start anything, couldn't take a job. That's right, and I nearly guessed it last night... when something he said made me want to cry. As I said to Miss Fox, he reminds me of Sir Herbert's cousin... the one that went to Australia and died there in no time. Yes, but our nice Mr. Bird isn't going to die, which is splendid. - I really think we ought to do something about it. - Aye. - Can't see what the fuss is about. - I'll bet you can't. Fellow was exactly what I said he was, except some fool doctor made a mistake about him. Only told him he was booked for the cemetery, that's all. If he thought he was going to die, what'd he come here for? 'Cause he wanted to finish up with a bit of posh life. That's right, isn't it, Mrs. Poole? You girls get on with your work and never mind about Mr. Bird. But somebody ought to have guessed it from the first. I knew there was something. There is only one thing to do, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Bird, who I like very much from the beginning, he come here to die... and now he live, which is a very romantic story, very nice. So tonight I give for him a very special dinner in the small dining room for his friends here... and we say how much we like him and we drink his health. That's the talk, Harry boy. - Afternoon. - Afternoon, Fred. - Taking him up the vet's? - That's right, Fred. Having him put away. Poor old sausage. Might as well. He don't enjoy life no longer. All right, Perc, get down then. Have a last sniff round. - What's this I hear about your friend? - Who do you mean, "friend"? I'm sorry we have to wait so long. Well, Gambini, this may be Bird's dinner, but it happens also to be my dinner... and I'm tired waiting for it, so I think we'll just sit down, eh? I must say, I agree with Sir Robert. Ought to make a start. - Aye, no right to keep us waiting. - None at all. Well, of course, Then please, we sit down, As a matter of fact, I'm beginning to think the whole thing's rather absurd. - You mean this dinner? - Yes, all this fuss about Bird. A doctor made a mistake, that's all. So what? The Regal Hotel... Pine - Pinebourne. Tell them. And give my love to - my love to - Give my love to them all. Funny thing. Thought I was going to die. Right after all. Just had to happen. But it's all right, you know. Not bad at all. Good thing, really. Not bad. Good. Well, I do think he might have turned up. - He's got your car too, hasn't he? - Yes. I suppose it's all right going off in somebody else's car. But I know Sir Herbert wouldn't have had it. I'm thinking it may be just possible that we're making fools of ourselves. Oh, well, no harm done, really, eh? - Oh, no, he's nice, Mr. Bird. - But he did rush us a bit, you know, I talked to him about a job, but there was no proof that he could have managed it. - No proof. I'm beginning to think the very same thing. You were a wee bit overhasty. But he seemed to have something special about him, George did. Might have been 'cause he was feeling he was for the long jump soon. Know what I mean? I believe that's just it, Mr. Clarence. Now, of course, it's different. He's just like the rest of us. Seemed to me a commonplace sort of chap, Not above throwing his weight about. But he never pretended to be anything else. He was always quite frank about that. - He was - - What? I don't know. I- I'm all mixed up. Let's talk about something else. Regal Hotel, Pinebourne. Yes? Yes? Bird? Yes, he was - What? Mrs. Poole speaking. Yes, all right. I'll tell them. As you know, it was at this stage of our convivial proceedings... that we'd planned a very enthusiastic toast. - Well, I think we still ought to have it. - Hear! Hear! But with one little modification. As our friend Bird has not condescended to appear at this dinner... we're doing without him. - And, in my humble opinion, doing very well. And we can still drink a toast - a toast to ourselves. And why not, ladies and gentlemen? A doctor made a mistake. Well, that's that. But like Mr, Bird, who's probably back in that sphere of life... that he perhaps adorns more gracefully than he did this one... we're all alive too - alive and kicking too! Perhaps in some ways rather more than he! I'm sorry to interrupt you. I think you'd like to know Mr. Bird is dead.
