And we also welcome his wife, Stella, and their fine young fellow, Charlie. And we wish you many contented years here, among the confined and confused. I refer, of course, to the present company, not to the patients. Please forgive the latecomer. A rather delicate moment with our new matricide. - Did I miss anything? - Only Jack's speech. Perfect timing. Peter, I'd like to introduce you to Mrs. Raphael. Yes, of course. I'm so sorry. Peter Cleave. - How do you do? - Stella Raphael. Peter is our longest-serving doctor here. I'm fixtures and fittings. Forgive me. I need that sausage. Excuse me. - What's your field, Dr. Cleave? - Peter, please. I tend to deal with the extreme cases. My particular interest... is sexual pathology and its associated catastrophes. - And what does your wife make of that? - She doesn't. I'm not. I spend my life immersed in the passions of others. Dangerous sport, love. I'm not sure I have the stomach for it. I've been married for 12 years. I'm not sure I've ever thought of it as a sport. Well, marriage is a different beast entirely. I'm talking about passion. What did Cleave have to say for himself? This and that. I rather liked him. Trust me, he's got fangs. - Who has? - Count Dracula. He wanted my job. Thought he deserved it for his years of loyalty. Why didn't you speak to any of the other wives? There wasn't time. But I'm so looking forward to our coffee mornings. You will involve yourself in the life of the hospital. - It's expected. - Of course. Now, the band. I thought last year's was splendid. Agreed? Yes, but can we have some slower numbers this time? I've only just recovered. It was exhausting. Rebook the band, subject to slowies. Show of hands. Carried. Next, do I have any takers for the cake? Stella, would you like to commandeer the fruitcake? - I'd be honored. - Lovely. And if you'll forgive the reminder, no liqueur. Alcohol, dear. Alcohol for the patients, verboten. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help! Help me! Are you joining us? No, I'm not. No. - It's this way. - No. But you're not allowed in the corridor! Come back! You're going the wrong way! - I'm so sorry. - No bother. Thank you. I don't mean to nanny, but it might be wise... to restrict yourself to the public areas of the hospital. One never quite knows what one might find. Do the male and female patients ever mix? Yes, of course. At the annual hospital ball. A perfect opportunity to mingle. Believe me, once a year is ample. - Can I give you a hand, Mrs. Bain? - No. Thank you, Mrs. Raphael. How did my predecessor fill her days? She sewed. Tapestry. One year, she did all the hospital, seen from above. Mommy! Come and see! - What, darling? - Come and see! Edgar, this is my mother. We've invented a test of strength. Will you time us? I don't have my watch on, darling. Just count then. Ready and lift. Go. Put him down. Sorry. I didn't see you there, Mrs. Raphael. Come on, Charlie. Thank you, Mrs. Bain. Charlie's made a new friend, that man doing the glasshouse. - Oh, good. - Is he safe? He wouldn't be in our garden if he wasn't. Working is a privilege. It can take years to earn it. They've all been fully vetted. - Is he one of yours? - No, Cleave's. His favorite, I think. - Favorite? - It's not unusual to have a pet patient. Who's yours? You. Why is Peter Cleave so taken with him? You know him, fancies himself an aesthete... and the fellow used to be a sculptor. What did he do? Heads, I think. - No, I meant... - I know what you meant. I interviewed him myself. Charlie is perfectly safe. Hello. I'm sorry about the other day. I hope you didn't get into trouble. No more than I'm in already, Mrs. Raphael. My husband tells me you were a sculptor. I still am. - May I ask how long you've been here? - You may. And? Six years. I killed my wife. She betrayed me. Mrs. Raphael. What have you done to him? Mrs. Raphael! He was climbing a tree. He fell. Can Edgar stay for tea? - I'm afraid he can't. He... - I've got to get back to work, Charlie. Thanks. How is he? He's fine, thank you. I don't think he'll be climbing any trees just yet. I don't know. Not my position... but I reckon he's an adventurer. You might be right. I suppose he gets that from you. I doubt it. It must be your husband then. Interesting dress. - Is that a compliment? - Yes. Might it be a touch too revealing, given the occasion? I'll mention it to my dressmaker. What a good idea. United front. May I have the pleasure? - Can you keep a secret? - Depends what it is. Jack told me he's planning to retire next year. I wonder who he's recommending as his successor. - Would it be someone I know? - It would. - Is it Peter Cleave? - Very droll. Congratulations. That's wonderful news. It'll be a huge commitment for both of us. I know it's not exactly ideal here for you and Charlie, but it'll change. We'll have that house and a garden. We'll be able to settle. Thank you for dancing with me. I can't take those. You could take what they mean. - Hello, Mr. Archer. - Edgar. Break over! How are you finding Mrs. Raphael? I don't have much to do with her. I'm busy with my work. But Mr. Archer tells me of your recent interest in horticulture. She's kind to me. I gave her some flowers a few weeks ago. And you danced with her. Only to show you I can behave myself with a woman. I don't doubt it. - You're pleased with my progress? - I'm not here to judge you. But, yes, you're progressing as one would want. And, in time... work duties lead to my release? Have patience, Edgar. We still have many mountains to climb. I've always done everything you've asked. Indeed, but that does not make you ready for the world. - But you've cured me. - Of what exactly? Severe personality disorder... with features of morbid jealousy. Continue with your work, and we'll continue to take a view. Any news on the job? You'll be the first to know. Stella behaving herself? Yes, Mother. That fellow's done wonders with your glasshouse. Yes, it's scrubbed up rather well, hasn't it? Our rockery resembles Berlin in '45. Perhaps you could pass him over to us. I don't know if it's my imagination, but isn't he rather attractive? - It's your imagination. - He is attractive. - Did he do something rather nasty? - He murdered his wife. Obviously sane. Can't think why we got him. What will happen to him? I have no idea. That's Peter's department. I suspect he will be overhauling rockeries for a good few years to come. Here's to locking the door and throwing away the key. What the hell is wrong with you? You had no right to say that. The way he casually dismissed that man's whole future, it was sickening. Policy is not your concern. - I thought the policy was to reform. - It's none of your bloody business! - Is it really so difficult to behave? - Like the other wives? - Like the other little ladies? - Frankly, yes. - Bye, Mrs. Bain. - Behave yourself, Charlie. Here, let me show you. Not here. Oh, no! - I just had a bath. - Your point being? - I forgot my checkbook. - Oh. - Where did you last see it? - Well, I don't know, do I? Here it is. Here we go, young man. Let's go to the zoo. Shall we do that first? And then we can go into the shop we went to... Are you all right? Have you seen a ghost? What's the matter, darling? There was a patient. - What patient? Where? - In the house. He might've been in Mommy's bedroom. Who was he? Do you know him? Can I use the phone, please? Is everything all right? It's been suggested that your dealings with Edgar Stark... went beyond propriety. - Suggested by who? - John Archer. And there have been whispers among the patients. These rumors soon get back to me. Naturally, I give them no credence... but I do need to know why they might have arisen. Stella talked to Stark in the garden. She talks to many of the patients. What of it? Stella? Well, Charlie was fond of him so of course I spoke to him occasionally. - You danced with him at the ball. - I danced with you, too. I'm afraid it's true. My God! - Does Max know? - I suspect so. It's a bloody catastrophe! The Home Office will be apoplectic, and in my last year. - Doubtless they'll require a head to roll. - Well, they're not having mine! Did you never think the man might try to escape? Of course not. Otherwise, I would have prevented it. Well, you were right about Max. He's not for us. Appalling, bloody stupid woman! She practically chauffeured the man out of the door! As for the wife, never in 40 years. He obviously has no control over her. Who will be her next prey, for God's sake? He'll have to go. May I suggest that we don't toss that particular bone to the press? At least, not yet. We'll be crucified in the papers as it is. They love a madman on the loose. We must preserve the integrity of the hospital for the future. Peter, when the Inspector arrives... do you think we can play down the more lurid aspects... of Stark's recent activities? Naturally. Do you think Stella helped him to escape? Not particularly. She was manipulated. I suspect she's fallen in love with him. You're fixated. That's why you passed him fit for work when you knew he was unstable. Drivel. Your wife destabilized him. One could hardly have predicted that element in the equation. I assume you're acting as Jack's factotum sent to extract my resignation? Spare us the grandiosity. Just get on with your work and keep quiet. I might remind you that I'm your superior. In what sense? How long? - You're supposed to time me. - I'm sorry, darling. If they catch him, will he be in trouble? I don't think they will catch him. He's been gone too long. I think he's on a boat sailing back to Australia. I think you should come and talk to me. Unofficially, of course. Let me help you. I might go up to town tomorrow and do some early Christmas shopping. - Something for me? - Wait and see. I'm Nick. It was me on the phone. Why were you so late? Had to be sure you weren't followed. How do you know him? I was his assistant... before. Did you think I'd abandoned you? I couldn't contact you till it was safe. And it's safe now? - How was London? - Busy. I saw something for you, but they didn't have your size. I have to go and collect it next week. Successful trip? You find what you were after? Yes. Finally. Where is it? Your shopping. The shopping you did in London. Where is it? - It's for Christmas. I've hidden it. - Where? - If I told you, it wouldn't be hidden. - Show me what you bought. Show me! Damn you! Happy Christmas. Forgive me. Does he suspect? He's buried in his work. Do you share a bed? I'm yours. So don't go back to him. Come and live with me. I can't just leave my family. Yes, you can. Give them up or don't come back. Once you're here, we'll find a way to bring Charlie, too. Please. I can't share you. Decide. How is Edgar? What on earth do you mean? Your housekeeper let slip you're taking regular trips to London. You're seeing him, aren't you? If you knew women, you'd know they like to shop occasionally. Don't delude yourself you're in love with a tortured genius. He's a failed artist... infinitely more dangerous both to you and himself. He's mine, and he needs my help. Evidently, he disagrees. You should know what he did to his wife. I don't need to know. I have nothing to do with the man. He beat her to death with a hammer and then decapitated her. He took a scalpel and cut out her eyes... and then he hacked at her face as if it were clay. Perhaps there won't be any more trips to London. Perhaps your mental state is too fragile. With Max's consent, we can hold you here. - Nonsense. - But we can. For your own safety, of course. Stella... tell me where he is. Mrs. B, how do you spell amoeba? With a dictionary, my dear. Don't ask me. I've got the brain of an amoeba. She's... She's having a little holiday. I'm sure she'll be back very soon. Shall I read to you? Has she gone to Australia? "That was Tom's great secret... "the scheme to return home with his brother pirates... "and attend their own funerals. "They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday." Can I move, please? I've got pins and needles. She taught me lots of things. She's a black Caribbean. Have you had a black woman? No, you haven't. I have. I was very drunk, but you know... I couldn't quite do the samba. She taught me a lot of things. Take it off. I'm working! - I'm going for a walk, all right? - Be careful. Thank you. - Are you following me? - No. What? You just like hanging around in markets? Have you any reason not to trust me? - So why have me followed? - It won't happen again. Sorry. - Why don't you trust me? - I said I'm sorry. I'm working. You're always working. It's just like being with my husband. - Is it? - Yes. - Like being with your husband, is it? - Yes. - Just like home? - Yes. - Is this what he was like? - Yes. Like this? - Hooray! Look at that. - Wonderful. - Tell me. - I miss Charlie. It's all right. Don't be sad. I love you. It doesn't matter, but I do. - No, you don't. - I do. I love him, too. - Happy Christmas, Stella. - Thank you. You touch her again, I'll fucking kill you! Please stay, Nick. I'm gonna clear out my stuff before he gets back. There's no point in arguing. It's not my place, but... Maybe you should come with me. He's turning. I've seen it before. With his wife? I saw the body. Please don't stay here. I thought you'd been caught. - Is that what you want? - No, of course not. - Are you missing your comforts? - No. You were going to Nick. Are you going to start hitting me now? I love you. I love you. He needs help. Can you find a doctor? I'll see what I can do. - I saw you together. You're fucking him. - No. Eat. When my wife took her lovers, she tried to poison me. Eat. You've checked those clothes? Mrs. Raphael. Let's go. You'll be released in the morning. Could I see Charlie? You're aware I could prevent you from having any further contact with him. But he needs you. You'll see him tomorrow. Thank you. Mr. Raphael, this way please, sir. Mr. Raphael, do you have any comments? There's a blanket in the back if you want to sleep. It's a long journey. - Where are we going? - Wales. - What? - Wales. North Wales. Sheep, tractors, and a genetic hatred of the English. Once it got in the papers, I was dismissed. I managed to get a position at a local hospital. - Jack fired you? - No. His successor. You asleep? Are you better now? I'll never go away again. I promise. I'm very, very sorry. Thank you for letting me see him. A stronger man would have let you rot. - You're strong. - Don't be trite. I wasn't strong enough to keep you. - Good night. - Good night. A little word of advice. Don't let your shame degenerate into self-pity. It seldom helps. Settled in all right? Walking, are you? Charlie. Mom! Good morning, sir. Come on. Good morning, Charlie. You all right? We can't live like this. Please come back to us. Please. Excuse me. Hello? Speak up, will you? This line's atrocious. Yes. - Could you tell me where? - Yes, Wales. Do you have an address? Well, I don't have an address. Only the hospital. Cledwyn General. - Could you repeat that, please? - Cledwyn. Well, I have no idea. Ask a policeman. Claudia, who is it? An old colleague of Dr. Raphael's. He's a mumbler. - May I? - Please. Who is this? Hello? Edgar? - Are you expecting the police? - Yes, they're here already. - If he comes for her? - I wouldn't like to say what he'd do. You put her on medication, I assume? She doesn't need it. She's fine. - Goodbye, Mr. Griffin. See you. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye, darling. Goodbye. Bye, Elaine. - Bye, Charlie. - Bye, Mr. Griffin. See you tomorrow. There's a school field trip next week. Are parents allowed to come? If you need me, I'll be upstairs. I've just got to finish something. Here. Parents are allowed on the field trip. I told a lie. Well, everyone lies occasionally. Good for telling me. Would you like some company? Well, I don't think I'm busy next week. I know you long for him. But you won't see him again. You know that, don't you? Yes. We'll be a family again, like before. In time, this will be what you want. Hurry, darling, we mustn't keep Daddy waiting. Hello? - Where's Mommy? - Phone rang. Sorry. - Who was it? - Mr. Griffin. Instructions for our field trip. - Inspector. - Good morning, Dr. Raphael. It's good of you to help out. You came. Let's go. I can't leave Charlie again. I promised him. I'll never stop loving you. - Where is he? - At school. We'll go and get him. Take him with us. No! He's gone. Now let him go! Six green bottles hanging on the wall Six green bottles hanging on the wall And if one green bottle should accidentally fall There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall Five green bottles hanging on the wall Five green If I can have your attention, please. Children, don't forget to collect items of interest in your jam jars. Now, if you could form yourselves into groups. Please, at least one adult in each. Here we go. Okay, one, two, there we go. Thanks, Mrs. Jones. There we are. There we are, Mrs. Raphael. Well done, Charlie. I'm going to catch a fish. Won't you need a rod? I'm hoping a small one will swim into my jar. Do you know fish can only remember things for eight seconds? Mrs. Raphael! Mrs. Raphael, do something! Do something! Thank you so much. Such difficult circumstances. Excuse me. Jack. Jack... you must come and visit me soon. Maybe next summer. It's so kind of you to deal with all this. Poor Max. The least I could do. Max is in complete agreement. Of course, I had to arrange things with the Home Office. It was a little bit sticky, but we got there. Well, arranging things is your forte, isn't it, Peter? Goodbye, my dear. Well, shall I keep you informed? I don't want to know. Oh, my dear. Peter, I just wanted to thank you for so many things. So sorry, dear Max. I want you to understand what's going to happen next. The shock will wear off... and it will be replaced by a devastating grief. In time, you'll come to terms with what you've done... and you'll just be very, very sad. And that sadness will stay with you... for the rest of your life. - Good evening. - Good evening. Come now. Good girl. Where's Charlie? - Where's my picture of Charlie? - With your belongings. - You mean, I can't see him? - Not yet. Because I killed him, didn't I? Come here. Is Edgar here? Of course not. Where is he? The past, Stella. He's in the past. Good afternoon. If you won't speak, I can't treat you. Do you want to stay in solitary forever? Talk. Say something! Express your contempt. She's here. She's been here six weeks. She's my patient. Why? Something terrible. The boy drowned. Yes, you were fond of him. Would you like to see her? Speak. Thank you. Did you do as I asked? To think rigorously about what it means to love? I'm beginning to understand that it was never real. That it was all an obsession. Can you define your feelings for him? I have none. It's over. It ended when Charlie died. If I told you he was here, in the hospital? Well, I suppose it would be logical if he were. The question was hypothetical. You've been very brave these past weeks. Thank you, Peter. I see you've got a flat tire. I don't need a car. - Not for work? - I've resigned. I think I might go into teaching. I'm... - I might be quite good with children. - Yes. Good idea. What do you want from me? Come. Welcome. Thank you, nurse. Would you like a drink? I usually have one about now. - I'd love one. - Yes. The usual? Your old usual, should I say? Your health. Yesterday, I went to see Max. I made a suggestion with which he concurred. My contacts at the Home Office might well release you from here... were I to guarantee your continued treatment and safety. What I mean to say is that... were you to live with me, in my house... these conditions would most likely be satisfied. I can offer you a fine home and a decent life... traveling, art, gardening, and so on. But I'm still married to Max. He wants to divorce you. You're a very dark horse. Well, I assure you this is not my usual procedure with patients. It's something that rather crept up on me. It would be arrogant to suggest that you might love me. But I believe you need me at present... and perhaps, in time, this need might grow into love of some variety. Are you a passionate man, Peter? I think that's something we'd have to discover. What would she want with an old queen like you? We have dialogue. I'm disappointed. I thought you wanted me. You resent it, don't you? That she might find happiness with someone else? I wondered if you might like this. Oh, Peter. Thank you. It's beautiful. It was my mother's. Shall we? Here. The ladies were discussing the hospital ball. Would you like to attend? I'm not sure. Well, it might be difficult for you. Memories and so on. - You'll be there? - Well, of course. Yes, that's true. Will Edgar be there? If we're to be married, Peter, let's not have lies. You knew he was here? I heard talk, and I know you. You wouldn't give up on a patient. I thought it might be traumatic for you. I would have told you in time. - Forgive me. - Of course. And to answer your question... he'll be at the dance. Unless you wish otherwise. Whatever you think is best. It might be useful for his recovery to see you've moved on, as it were. You'll fail her. He did. I did. So will you. Perspective. We can work with that. Cleave... will you let me see her? Please. The hospital ball might be an opportunity. Cooperate in your treatment... and we'll see. You look magnificent. You look very dashing yourself. I remember that dress. I'm amazed it still fits. - Will you dance with me later? - That would be lovely. Stella, shall we? By the way, I went to fetch Edgar, and he was asleep. I woke him and he said that he'd changed his mind... and didn't want to come. Leave me alone.
