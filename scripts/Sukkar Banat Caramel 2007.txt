Please let me in before the redhead. Hello, Soussou. - How are you? - Fine. What will it be today? Lots of volume, like a fluffy cat. For Sunday. What's on Sunday? We might bury my sister-in-law. She's dying, she won't last long. But everything is ready. I bought two pretty trays... ...for serving coffee and cigarettes. Handmade, at a very good price. And what a dress I got her! With lace, especially around the collar. Then I took it to the tailor... ...to take it in. Layale, it's for you. Hello. Okay. Okay, my love. Soussou, I have to run. Nisrine will look after you. Okay? This is outrageous! Nisrine, look after the shop. I won't be long. Nisrine. - Lili. Lili, what are you doing? - Working. What? What are you doing? - I'm looking for a piece of paper. - What paper? My piece of paper. Okay, out of the way. I'll give you another one. But! Take this one, it's better. Take it. - I don't want it. - It's much nicer. Look how nice these are. There's plenty. Forget the other one. - Where are you going? - I'm going to Hell, where else? Go now. Hello, Miss. Hello. You'd look prettier with the seatbelt on. I can't, it suffocates me. Truth be told, you're absolutely right. But public safety requires it. And if I don't put it on? I'll have to... ...fine you. As if I'm not fined enough? Better now? Satisfied? Marvelous. - Can I go now? - Drive safely. Thank you. - What's up? - Oh, my God! Do you want a snack? Your shirt is pretty. Did she give it to you? I won't leave until you fix my hair. - What is this? - Volume. You call this volume? Do you like it? Would you go out looking like this? - What's up? - Shut them up... ...before I lose my temper and hurt someone. We need to close. What's this pin for? - It's chic. - You consider this chic? What's wrong? Aren't you late for the audition? My hair doesn't resemble the haircut in the magazine. Look closely at the picture. Can't you see that the model is your daughter's age? Shut up and go inside. That's enough. What's wrong? It's looks great. You think this is great, Layale? My hair has no volume. See how she glued these? I look old and cockeyed. Like a femme fatale. Shut your trap! What does she want? To get rid of me? No, to be your loyal slave. Will you shut up? It's too hot in here. Don't be cheap, turn on the AC. The electrical fuse might blow up. - Shut up. - Switch off the fridge. Forget this tape, it's useless. Yeah, you're right. Why do you insist on using it? I'll tie your hair in a way... ...that will lift your eyes up without the tape. You'll look younger. Then, we take off this pin. - Look how gorgeous. - You think so? You're dazzling. Like an orchid. Rima, Johnny Bravo's here. Thank God we're closed. Hi, girls. Hello. Good evening. How are you, Bassam? If they like your hair, tell them I did it. Good luck with the audition. Rima, take care of the shop. - Yeah, okay. - Bye. Hello, Auntie Rose. How are you? - Fine, and you? - All is well. How are you, Lili? I've got some aprons that need fixing. Put them on the table. Stay for coffee. We'll have a chat. Some other time. I have a bus to catch. Bye, Lili. Lili, she's saying goodbye. Bye, bye, bye. Okay, I'm off. Goodnight. Thank you. Lili, why are you acting this way? She was talking to you. You want to scare the customers away? What are you doing? Do I look better now? You'd look better without the chewing gum. Welcome, it's a great honor. Behold our future bride. It's a great pleasure. You made us happy. Bless you. Are you mad? No one can see us. My God. You're so handsome. Let me do the dishes. You've been up since this morning. No, let me do it. I'll do it! Okay, dear? How is work? Everything is fine? Hello. Is there a problem? No, everything's great. Please, feel at home. Thank you. I cannot speak louder. My little brother's asleep. I can't go to the living room. My parents will hear me. Wait, I'll go to the bathroom. Can you hear me better? How many times must we talk about it? I don't feel myself. What's his problem? Hello. Hello. A problem with the car? No. Is there a problem? The lady is your wife? The lady is my fiance. Your fiance. What are you doing in the middle of the night? We were at a party. Now we're having a chat. And I'm about to walk her home. Why don't you chat at her place? This is an indecent activity. Two people talking in the street... ...is an indecent activity? Who can prove she lives here? Her parents live here. Do you want us to go up and check it out together? Lower your voice. Quit it, I'm talking. Who can prove she's your fiance? Instead of catching criminals, you're harassing us? Exactly! Help me, God! He doesn't want to understand. - And now what? - Your ID. - Give him the ID. - No way. Give him the ID. Don't make a scene. Never! What a stubborn mule. Comply, or get out of the car. My God, I'm always misunderstood. Get out of the vehicle, please. I won't get out! You get in! "The policeman having insisted... ...several times... ...that the driver..." What's his name again, our "Romeo"? Bassam the Bragger. Bragger! Bragger. "...to get out of the vehicle..." What did he say? "Even God won't get me out". God? "Even God won't get me out... ...of the vehicle." He's one strong guy. You know that we have enough reasons to send you to jail? That'll make your day. Oh, yes, our beautiful bride Oh yes, Bassam is at her feet Oh yes, for you we shall sing Walk proud Our lovely and pretty bride If that night, Bassam didn 't mess up And the police didn 't rub His face in the mud And your father didn't threaten him Your wedding day Would have never come so soon! Walk proud, my lovely bride The most beautiful rose In the garden Help! Help me! Please, help me! - Please let go. - No way! I want them. Even if I must lie in the middle of the road. Go back, please. Let go. I'll call a policeman. I've had enough! But I am the police. He deserves it. - Although he's cute. - Cute? Him? You never like anybody? Enough. Without him, we'd still be at the police station. Even God wouldn't get him out of the car. These are parking tickets. Why do you want them? They are from my fianc. Your fianc? Come here. My God, your grip is as powerful as a crab's claw! What's the matter, my dear Lili? He's torturing me. - What's going on? - She's collecting tickets. You don't want that? That's better, isn't it? - I don't want it. - Take a flower. I don't want it! What is she doing? She is stealing the tickets! Thank you for what you did last night. It's nothing. If you hadn't been there... You know, I didn't do much. You could drop by our salon sometime. - We'll give you special treatment. - One day, I will. Nisrine, come here! All the girls will be at your service. Goodbye. We'll be expecting you. You think you're stronger than the policeman? Go inside now. I won't. Stop. I'm working. Oh, really! You're working? You do nothing but follow me. Hello, ladies. Hello. Welcome. Don't talk to her! Come, let me give you some love. Go inside. Ma'am, could you, please... Go in, so I can understand. How can you understand him? You can't even understand me. - He's American. - Shut up. Let me find out what he wants. He wants me to run away with him. Go inside, you're embarrassing me. I want to know what he wants. Go play with the rubbish you've been collecting. Don't come out again. There. That's the vest. The jacket. It's too big, it needs fixing. - Oh, you want to fix it? - Yes. The trousers need shortening. That's fine. Go change. Alright. Go in and try it on. - Try. - Alright. Thank you. My darling likes to go for a stroll In the evening, he says Let's go If I say no, I'm in trouble Welcome, my prince Lili, what are you doing? You keep on sewing. Sorry. Good morning, sir. How are you? Where have you been, my love? Hello, Auntie Rose. Here are the aprons. Come in, don't stay by the door. No, I can't. I left Lili by herself. Don't worry about Lili. Come in for a hairdo. We're not busy. - No, no. - Come on in. I must go, she's alone. Your hair needs a good brushing. Come on in, we're having coffee. Come in, we need to find you a husband. You're a bit late. You're still beautiful, come in. No, Lili's all by herself. I must go. Hello. Sorry, I came without an appointment. Can I get my hair done? - Something's bothering you? - Not at all. I was just walking by. I decided to come in. I had nothing to do. I'm glad that you came. Go on, run. Handsome young man. Don't forget! Pick up the ones under the car. And you, sweetheart. Pick up the two papers over there. Put them in the basket. God bless you and keep you safe. Yes, put them in there. I want to see what he wrote to me. What? He loves me very much. He wrote me all these letters. - Thank you, dear. - Okay, bye. Don't be long! Hello, my love. Hello. Hello, sunshine. You forgot your wallet. I was expecting your call. What? I swear, I've been waiting for an hour. Ask Joseph. Okay, stop fooling around. When can you pick it up? Now I'm busy. I'm having my coffee. And Joseph is foreseeing my future. He sees a chair and a beautiful girl. She's at the window. She's looking at me without seeing me. I swear. There's even a fly on my forehead. She parks in forbidden areas... ...to tease the policeman who's admiring her... ...instead of fining her. You find it funny! Okay, goodbye. Anything else? Can you sign here, please? - Where? - Here, please. That's it? Here also. New regulations. - Anything else? - Thank you. Let's go. - Can I drop you off somewhere? - What? - Drop you off? - No, thanks. Don't bother. Tarek, answer. Tarek, answer! Hurry up, La. Yes, Dad. Mom? She's not here. I don't know. Smoking a joint next door. Stupid! Damn you! What's the matter? I'm busy. I'm busy in the kitchen. What do you want? What? Why promise the kids... ...and then change your mind? Good for you. Okay, leave me alone. Okay, goodbye. What an idiot! And you two, out of my sight! Your father is busy. He's taking his girlfriend to the beach. Hello. I want to have my hair done. Of course, come in. - Hello. - Good morning. Welcome. Start the generator, I need to use the blow dryer. Sorry it took me so long. It's okay. Mr. Charles! Mr. Charles, tell her to let me out. Why are you so stubborn? Stubborn as a mule! You old bag! In your dreams, I'll let you out! I'm going to kill her. There are people expecting me for dinner. Expecting you? In Hell, yes. You wait and see. The plane is about to take off. It's getting dark. She wants to travel now. I'll send you up to Heaven, alright. I'm going to tell the neighbors. They'll eat you alive. Rose! Damn whoever gave you that name. Excuse me. Wait till I get my hands on you. If you drive the customers away, how will we survive? Go upstairs! - The plane is taking off. - What plane? Where to? I'm expected for dinner. Yes, everybody's expecting you. If you drive them away, how will we live? I'm sorry, sir. Sorry. Are the trousers okay? I'd like them a little shorter, please. - Shorter? - Yes. I like it. - Shorter? Like this? - Yes. Nice, isn't it? Just what I needed. Another crazy fool. Walid. Can you call me from the land line? I'm too tired. I need to check if my mobile is working. Do as your sister says. Okay, it's working. - Where are you going? - I'll be back. Rabih, it's Layale. Rabih. Can you hear me? Layale. Layale. Yes? The fan's batteries are dead. Do you have any? Hello! Come in. Look in the cup, there's a white horse! Do you know what it means? You'll be married soon. Are you hiding secrets from us? Hiding secrets from your mother? You believe this nonsense, Mom? Yes, of course! Make a wish now. There's a husband, look at the ring! Look how it sparkles. That's good. She's going to get married. That's for sure, you're going to be happy. You believe this rubbish? Things she's told me have come true... We'll eat cakes. We'll rejoice. Hi, my name's Jamale Tarabay. I have two children. Turn the board around. I can't read it. My name's Jamale Tarabay... The light's too strong. Nothing I can do about it. Look into the camera. I have two children. I have many hobbies. I was an actress. - Really! What kind of roles? - Soap operas. You've never seen me? Not really. Series and ads too. Such as? Products, detergents, lots of things. Okay. Now lose the board. Higher. Very good. Now the other way. - How? - The other way. Lower your arms. Tell me about yourself. Right side. No. Right, darling. Okay, tell me about yourself. I have lots of hobbies. I like music, painting... Very good. Other side now. Other side, please. Okay. Go on. Sideways? Can you walk now? - That way? - Please. Are you a group? No, just two people. - Two girls? - No. My husband and me. Ah, you're married. Two people. A double bed, I guess? - When for? - Saturday. Saturday, just a minute. Can I have your name? Rosette Baddour. Rosette Baddour? Pretty name, Baddour. Are you from Beit-Mry? I have friends from the Baddour family. From Beit-Mry, yes. Mr. Samir, the owner of the supermarket. Do you know him? He's a relative. By the way, were you living in Canada... No. I'm sorry. I need your ID card, please. Or any other ID proving that... ...you're married. These are the regulations. Just a second... Take your time. It's hot. Can we open the window? No, darling. We can't. Sorry. Let's continue. Now face the wall. Look straight in front of you. Sideways. Now look at the wall... ...as if speaking to a friend. - Recite the script. - Like this, or towards you? Your body still, your face towards me. My body still and my face towards you? Yesterday, I met my friend. She told me, "Your face is glowing. What's your secret?" Sorry to interrupt... ...but there's something stuck on your eyebrows. I told her, " I am using the new soap Eve." It has a freshening effect. Every evening, I wash my face with it. Smile. You should be happy about your fresh complexion. My friend congratulated me on my complexion. She told me, "What do you do to have such a radiant complexion?" "I use a new soap. Eve." It's very good in the evening. It is very fresh. - Come on, go on. - I can't. - You'll be with whom? - Sorry? Who you're sharing the room with? With my husband. Can I have your name? Liliane Chakkour. I need an ID card, please. Hello. Good morning, Pasha. I'm fine, thank you. At your service. It's okay. We'll be there in five minutes. God be with you. Good morning. A morning full of roses and jasmine! Any cake left? My God! What's this place? What? Oh, my God! - Why are you so gloomy? - Look who's talking! What have you done to your face? Just a bit of touching up. Makeup. Since this morning... ...like an idiot... ...I've been cleaning every inch of the room. I almost bleached the carpet. I even allowed myself to be taken... ...for a hooker. And he doesn't even call. He just sent a message: "Can't get away from my wife." What kills me is how stupid I am. I spend my life waiting for a horn. A car horn! - What horn? - Forget it. Lucky he didn't show up, the cake is terrible. Let me taste. How many eggs did you put in? Ten, as you said. Ten? Are you out of your mind? Disgusting. I can't even look into my parents' eyes. I'm so ashamed. In the evening they ask: "Where were you?" I say, "At the salon." "When are you getting married?" What do you want me to tell them? And I'm still lying to myself... ...thinking that he's going to leave her. What gets to me, is not knowing... ...who is this woman that he can't leave? I want to know who she is. What she's like. How she walks. How she smells. Do you think you are the only one living a lie? Nisrine? What's the matter? Honey, what's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What is it? I swear, I'm fine. We should be talking about your wedding. What's the matter? My prince charming won't be the first. What do you mean? Bassam won't be my first man. - He doesn't know? - No, he doesn't. Don't fuss, we'll kill two morning doves. What are you talking about? I've heard that if a girl has sinned... ...a little dove's blood on the bridal sheet will do. Why not sparrows? Maybe it looks more real. How do you trick the husband? Well, the bride works it out. It's like a challenge. You and your crazy ideas. What do you suggest? What happened? Let's go, girls. Back to your rooms, break's over. Stop lazing around. Souad Abdel-Sater? Why not Abdel-Satan! I don't understand. Souad Abdel-Sater? Where did you get that name? In the obituaries? Couldn't you pick a Christian name? Rita or Theresa, for example? While we're at it... ...let's choose a French name. Marie, Julie. I can't be a "Marie" just once? Yes, it would suit you. What, you think you're going to the Moulin Rouge or the Lido? It's just a clinic. Stop fussing. You can hardly say "hi" in French. You flunked it in high school. I don't have to speak. So you'd be a dumb French girl? What do you know? I can speak French. My name is Julie. I'm from Paris. I've come for a "hot" couture. Shut up, he'll hear us. Okay, I'll shut up. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. I'm going to the museum, please. - Where? - Museum. Get in. Good morning. But we're not going to the museum. We'll take a shortcut. Don't worry. I know the way. Julie what? - Pompidou. - Pompidou? For Dr. Stambouli? Fourth... ...floor, lift is on your left. Miss Pompidou... ...signature, please. Two Stambouli stitches... ...and you'll be good as new. Like a teenager. If Mr. Pompidou calls... ...tell him I am at the tailor's. What are you listening to? Your hair is beautiful. Thank you. I like yours too, but... ...short hair would suit you, you have a beautiful face. I wish. We could do it now. Cut my hair? They'd go mad at home. Rima. You've used up the hot water. What now? Oh, sorry. I've come for... ...the special... The waxing offer. I didn't quite understand. Someone from your salon called me. Isn't this salon Si Belle? Yes, I called you. - Your name? - Christine Khoury. My appointment is for tomorrow. But today is better. Is it a problem? No, no problem. What will it be? Waxing. Layale. The lady's here for the special. The waxing offer. Hello. This way, please. Sorry. It might be a bit hot. Don't worry. Maybe I'm oversensitive today. Don't worry. Your hair is so beautiful. Thank you. I've always wanted to dye my hair black. Why don't you? I'm thinking about it. But my husband likes me the way I am. I don't want to upset him. He doesn't like change. Wait a second. Sorry. It's okay. What, should I have asked for your permission before inviting her? Stop being obsessed with her. Did you see her ass? Enormous. Relax. As for you, I'll cut your tongue off if you mock me. - I'm scared. - Are you talking to me? - Have you seen your ass? - Shut up! Thanks, you're so kind. Aren't you tired? Holy Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you. You are blessed amongst women. And Jesus, Blessed be the fruit of your womb. - Hail Mary... - Holy Mary. Mother of God, Pray for us poor sinners. Now and at the time of our death. You're killing me. - Once more. - No, that's enough. Our Lady won't forgive you. Not at all. Why won't she forgive me? One more Hail Mary? Two, if you want. Hail Mary... Father Constantin, pray for me! I'll call the vicar, I'll ask him to pray. God give you health. Hello! Hello, young man. Welcome. We thought you'd never come. What a pleasure. Come in. Thank you. Sorry... Girls, let the gentleman through. - Good morning. - Come in, come in. Samia, can you give your place to Mr. Handsome? Of course. Please, son. Sit down. - Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. Layale. We need you here. What should we do to this lovely face? The sideburns? It won't hurt. The moustache? I'd say... ...a few hairs here and there. Quickly, with the tweezers. For the moustache, we'll see. As for the eyebrows... Absolutely. Heat the sugar, please. Welcome. Thank you. Under your protection We shelter, Holy Mary. Dear Rose, Meet me for coffee at Doughan's... ...Tuesday at 5? Charles Hello, Auntie Rose. What a surprise. What brings you here? - What's up? - She's got news. I've come to fix my hair. No! I don't believe it. Rose finally came to fix her hair! Let's pick the best color. It's an honor. The best hairdo. Where's the catalogue? I told you, I have an audition. I put on some makeup. Had my hair done. And my nails too. Of course I'm beautiful, darling. I'm gorgeous. I'm waiting for my turn. - Thank you, darling. - Thank you. Was I a bit shy? Not at all. You were very good. We'll call you soon. Okay? Bye-bye. - Hello, Jamale. - Hi. How are you? Where have you been? - Me? - Show me. Your new color is lovely. Hello, Rana. What's the matter? Jamale! You've got blood on your skirt. I can't believe it! Girls, have you got a maxi pad? Come in, come in. Just a second, I'm coming. Is everything ready for the wedding? Everything's fine. I've still got a small matter to sort out. But it will be alright, God willing. Sarah, come here, darling. Would you like something to drink? No, thank you. Red polish, like yours? It's very nice on you. That depends on what you're wearing. A red dress. It's a surprise for my husband. It's our wedding anniversary. I've been running since this morning to get everything ready... ...without him even noticing. I baked a cake. I hope it'll be good. Normally... ...my cakes are tasty. Damn it! I forgot the balloons. I'll ask my sister to buy some. So family and friends will be there. All the people he loves. He should be happy, right? Something's bothering you? No. Are you okay? Are you feeling alright? Here is your tip. You deserve more. No, thank you. I insist. How beautiful you are! Darling, what are you doing? You're going out? Let me work a bit. Work. Draw a nice moustache. I know where you're going. Go and wash your face, first. Lili, that's enough! He doesn't like women with makeup. He likes my style. That's enough, get out. Slow down, Rima. The girl is sick. I drive as I damn well please. It's your mouth we should've sewn up. I don't believe this. You'd rather I drove into the potholes? You haven't missed a single one so far! I just love listening to your complaints. - You wanted to sit in front! - All I want is to arrive in one piece. Do you have an audition or not? Open, dear. Rose. Open, so we can pray together. I brought you some fish for dinner. Are you coming? Poor me. I'm tired of this life! Rosa. My precious. You want to go to Manara? Maybe I'll bury you there. Please, open. May God send you a nice husband. I love you, Rose. Why are you so stubborn? Why? Are you deaf? Shall I take you to an ear doctor? What a mistake to let you do this to me! How can one trust women? Are you nuts? Pull the curtains, it's not a show. You think you're the main attraction? Why not razors? One day, you'll miss having all that hair. I'd like to see you in a skirt, like a real girl. You're always complaining. You can't come to my wedding looking like this. You have nice legs. Why do you hide them? You want me to be like you? Look at her. I feel sorry for your husband. I'll deal with you later. I can't take it anymore. Take it off. Two more minutes. I like his voice more than yours, Rima. Come on, darling, get it out of your system. When it comes to horns, his horn is really special. Your taste. - What's wrong? - This is naughty. It's good for a bride. Mom, stop stuffing everything in this suitcase. Who would wear such old stuff? As if I knew it would take you ten years to get married. And besides, it's your auntie who brought them. Then let her wear them. It's very nice. Look in the mirror. Come on, Nisrine, hurry up. I have something to tell you. So you know what to expect. You're no longer a child. I did well in bringing you up. But this is your last night at home. This separation breaks my heart. Tomorrow, it'll be your night. You know what this means. You go from one stage to another. It will be the second stage of your life. All girls go through that. I've been through it too. You shouldn't be shy with him. He's your husband, your prince. For better or for worse. At first, it'll be difficult. Then you'll get used to it. Slowly, you'll get to know him. That's life. Only God knows what's in store. It's like a melon. You must cut it to see if it's good. God bless you. You'll always be my little girl. Stop, Mom, you'll make me cry. Don't forget, my darling. - Don't cry. - You're my life. Our home will always be open for you. I'll always pray for you. - Let's go. - Yes, love. - I don't want to see you cry. - Alright, darling. Just a second. Just a second. Sorry for interrupting. I'd like to present a small gift... ...to the bride and the groom. A modest gift. I don 't care what people say Your name is my prayer And fills me with Joy More beautiful than the earth, our love is They talk about love When they talk about you Love if you wish But love as they do... Are you in line for the bathroom? Yes. May I go in before you? I've got my period. No, no. Okay? Come on, girls. Ready? One... Two... Three! Look, it's a morning dove! To my Beirut
