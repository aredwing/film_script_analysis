I told you, you can just come over to my room. Under my special skills on my rsum. I'm sure it is. It's probably the only thing that's there. Nice. I bet you I can get tears in the first interview. Who? Mom or Dad? Don't insult me. All right. What's the bet, then? Um... Sizzler. That salad bar will run you up. And the dessert tray. Can I ask you... can I ask you guys a question? - What? - God. What's the story with the girl? She's a garbage-pail user. Oxies, benzos. Dad was a drunk. Probably beat her up. I'm thinking molested. Seriously? We'll find out. What are oxies and benzos? - Is that what you said? - Wow! Are you kidding me? Where did you find this guy? Why hire professionals when we've got craigslist over here? You guys know I'm hearing this, right? I'm so sorry. Where did the company get your rsum again? Craigslist. How much longer, film school? Um, I'm almost done. - You're almost done? - Yeah. Mic one, mic two. My God. Mic two. Are we good? Yeah, we're ready. Let's go. I look into the camera, or do I... Is it too late to want to go to the bathroom? Yes. Okay, so, let's start from the beginning. What are your earliest memories about Carson? When she was born, she was so perfect. She was a blessing... an absolute blessing. She liked to tag along, you know, with me, and she would, you know, pretend to do the same things that I was doing and... She's good and nice and kind and, um, is really smart and talented. She loved Sunday school. She practically memorized the whole Bible. You could, name any verse, she could quote it right back to you. We are religious. We go to church every Sunday. Carson too? She used to. She got a scholarship to, Eastlake. It's a real prestigious Catholic school. We're not even Catholic. That's how smart she is. Does my hair look okay? - Yeah, you look great. - Okay. Carson came to Eastlake junior year, and she really didn't know anybody, you know? She was new. But I kind of always try to be nice to the new kids. You know, I mean, yeah, it's a Catholic school, but it doesn't mean everyone has religion. But she did, and she was always wanting to do the right thing and... she just wanted to fit in. I miss hanging out with her. I miss her. I just... like, I can't hang out with a junkie. Just one second. Sorry about that. No, just doing your job. There we go. Can you do me a favor and tell me... Okay, here we go. What is your full name? Carson Morris. And what is your drug of choice? Heroin. Put that in a complete sentence for me. Your mother told me you can quote practically the whole Bible from memory. Not the whole Bible, but... I know a lot of verses. I-I used to. Jason, hand me that Bible behind you, please. Hebrews 2:18. I know that one. "For because He has suffered when being tempted, He is able to help those being tempted." I nailed that. Yes, you did. That was very cool. Very cool, Carson. Why are you filming me? I just want you to see yourself. Stop filming me! She started to argue a lot. We just thought it was just some kind of teenage rebellion kind of thing, but... Eastlake is very expensive, and these weren't the kind of kids that Carson was used to being around. I don't know, I guess she just wanted to fit in, and she didn't. She'd start going out at night and she wouldn't come home, call or anything. And then she started, um, dressing in that goth way, which really disturbs me. I swear, it was like she changed overnight. She just became... Like a zombie. She became like a zombie. Like, catatonic. Yeah, she would just lay in bed, and she wouldn't wake up. When we'd try to wake her up, she'd just sleep and sleep. The drinking and the drugs came after that. Sometimes, her eyes... it's like nobody's home, and she doesn't... she doesn't always remember what she did. I'll ask her... It's all right. It's just a bulb. We had just finished services, and... the entire congregation was coming out of the church. - Carson! - Fuck! - Hey! - Fuck! Fuck you! Help me! Somebody, help me! I think we've got her. Thank you so much. And fortunately, she ran out of energy, and we were able to help her and calm her down. Beth, she blames the school mostly, um, and I tell her it's not the school. It's not the other people. It's us. Steve took it pretty hard when his business failed. We were struggling financially. I think he just felt like he wasn't providing enough for us. So, that was the only thing that caused tension at home? No. I have anger issues. I'd say that, yes. But I-I control them. How do you control them? I just sort of be quiet and... Can you put that in a complete sentence? "I control my anger issues..." I-I-I control my anger issues by, um, just holding them inside and being quiet. Is that really dealing with them, though? I don't know. What do you want me to do? Throw the TV through the window or something? That's dealing with it. - No. - Yeah. I eventually told him that if he didn't get sober that it was over, and I'll leave and I'll take Carson with me. God was a very big part of that. Carson, do you believe in God? I don't know. If there is a God, I don't really think he cares about me much. Carson? Why can't you stop, just for one day, see how it feels? Because when I stop, I want to slit your fucking throat. I find needles. I find pills. She lives to get high. It's all that she cares about. Drugs have darkened her. They've squashed her spirit. I've tried... I've tried really hard to be a good mother. I've tried to, um... I want her to be a better woman than me. I'm not really sure what you're wanting to see in here. No, this is great. We just need, cutaways. On the show, we'll cut to, you know, like, one of those photographs. Okay. I'll just... I'll just stay right over here. But, then, could you just... but actually, I need you to actually just step out of the room for a sec while we, um... - With too many people... - Don't touch anything. Yeah, no problem. Listen, Beth, thank you. - Okay. - Seriously. We will... we'll be right there. Thanks. Check the drawers. She just said not to touch anything. Come on, dude. This is what we do. Her journal, her diary. Use your imagination. We don't have a lot of time. She's gonna come back. All right. No, this is like her underwear. No. That's good. That's good stuff. You likey. Whoa. What do you think this is about? What? Look at these. Demonic Possession & Mental Illness? What do you think this is all about? That could be something? Wait a minute, wait a minute. You think so? We've got a teenage addict, trouble at home, into Satan? Pfff! Seriously, this girl's got real secrets. I need you to go find them, okay? I'll do it. I got it. - Look under the bed. - All right. Check out the creepy dollhouse. Geez. Ha! Hey, Carson. Find anything good? Dude, I'm gonna... I'm gonna stop rolling, Tim. So, how many episodes of this have you actually shot? Is this 20 questions? I don't know. - Eight, nine? - 10. - Nine. - Nine? Cool. What's the ratio for the show? - What? Success ratio? - Yeah. Half and half. 50% still sober after six seasons. It's a coin toss, so... She's really pretty. Don't you think? Not for long, man. Junkies get old fast. Maybe she'll get better. You're one of those dudes that needs to, like, rescue women. Pfft, no. Are you crazy? No, I don't. Did they teach you that in film school, too, or you just seen too many bad movies? You write poetry? What are you doing? Um, just getting an exterior. Did I ruin your shot? It's okay. How about this? Do you see the house like this? Yeah, that's perfect now. Hey, do you mind if I ask you a question? Sure. I saw those books in your room about demonic possession. Yeah? Do you believe in that stuff, like, actually? Do you? That's my camera. Yeah, so, camera guy... Yeah? You believe in demonic possession? I don't know, I don't know. I haven't seen any evidence of it. What would you consider evidence? I don't know. Jason! Sorry, sorry. I got... I got to pop off that shot. Sorry. Like I have time for this right now? I know. Sorry... Just a second. If the nuns at Eastlake knew what I was doing with this tie... So, what channel is this gonna be on? It's for educational purposes... schools, stuff like that. My mom gave me these scented candles for Christmas. This one's called "Holiday Home." You like it? It's very festive. Almost there. There we go. I can't even... It's good. It's, like, insulating me. - Carson. - Jason! - Your wrist is bleeding. - Get out of my shot. Thanks. Rule number one for aspiring junkies... always keep a tissue close at hand. You know, I haven't had time to read the backgrounder today... It's only three pages, my friend. That's... yeah, well, you know, I've been sitting on a plane for two hours and the terminal for four hours, so the backgrounder really hasn't entered into my... thank you. Suzanne, I have to counsel these people on camera in five minutes. I could appreciate some goddamn support and then a little water. - Yeah, okay. - Thank you. Addict's name is Carson. She's an I.V. heroin user. She has blackouts, personality changes, severe mood swings. - Who are the parents? - Dad is Steve. He's enabling. Guilty about his own past alcoholism. Mom is Beth. She's religious. Prays for Carson to get better. Jesus has not stepped in thus far. - History of abuse, trauma... - Nothing yet. Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. I've been digging. Mom spanked her a couple of times. Dad drank for a few years. We can do parental neglect, but it's not very sexy. Maybe something else will come out in rehab. All right, Mom, let's start with you. What are you prepared to do today if Carson refuses treatment? Kick her out of the house. Dad, are you prepared to back her up on that? Can I be honest? Your daughter's life's at stake. You better be. I don't think that I want to throw her out of the house. I mean, if she's out on the street, what's she gonna do to buy drugs? As long as she's here, she's... As long as she is here, she has a free place to stay. She has money for pills. It is very easy for her to be an addict here. Now, I'm not saying it's your fault, Dad, but you are helping her stay addicted. Understand me? The only chance she has to get better is if you draw the line. Okay. - Thank you. - Okay. - Thank you. Thank you. - I'll do it. What the fuck? Carson, I'm Dr. Dean Prentiss. Please have a seat. No, I'm not doing this right now. All you have to do is listen. Nobody here's gonna force you to do anything. I need to go to my room first. I want you to listen to what they have to say before you use. Carson, we're not going anywhere until you hear us out. Please have a seat. Steve. "I've seen you go from a straight 'A' student "who memorized Bible verses "to a junkie who would do anything to buy her pills. "If you don't get help now, "I will no longer give you an allowance, "and as painful as it is, "I can no longer stand by and watch you kill yourself right before my eyes." Good. - I'll leave. - And go where? Steve, that's enough. So, you won't get help? You can't help me. Mom. "Carson, we love you so very much, "and we are so very proud of all that you have accomplished. "But we can't stand by any longer and watch you destroy yourself." The path that you now travel is troubled, and I just believe that this is the Lord's way of answering all our prayers. The Lord does not care about me. Maybe that's because you've been defying Him. I'm not defying Him! Shh, shh! It's okay. Okay, McKee. "Carson, you're a really good friend, "and I really want you to get better. "We used to have so much fun together. Then, all of a sudden, things changed." Shut the fuck up! Eat these lies, bitch! Carson, stop right now! What are you doing?! Just leave her alone! Carson, stop it! - Stop her! - Let her go. Everybody, just let her go. Everything's okay. Carson, I'm coming in. Carson, what you're going through is not uncommon. I've been through it myself. I'm an addict too. I lost everything. With drugs, I lost my... my job, my family, my self-respect. Yeah, but now you're a big TV star, so I guess it all worked out pretty well for you. It worked out for me because I got help. I know how you feel. You don't like using drugs. You're not getting high anymore. You are a maintenance user. You just don't know how to stop. You don't know what this is. Tell me. You won't believe me. Try me. No, thanks. Tell them how you really feel, Carson. What are you talking about? - What's he talking about? - I don't know. Jason, shut up. Carson, it's... it's okay. Look at me. There's something... evil inside of me. And you're using drugs to keep down that evil, violent feeling. All kinds of names for what you're going through. That's what addiction is. You're possessed. But you can get better, Carson. There's still good in you. I'm so tired of fighting it. Then let us help you. Okay. Okay. I'm doing it. It was great. She freaked out. She attacked her friend and tried to shove her letter down her friend's throat. And she thinks she's possessed! Yes, possessed! He followed right up on it, of course. Okay, cool. Yes, we absolutely will. No, you got your promo footage today, I'll tell you that right now. You're welcome! Bye! Yes! You're gonna do great. Thanks. Dean, how are you? Good to see you. Kordis, great to see you. All right, welcome. - You must be Carson? - Yeah. Dr. John Kordis. Nice to meet you. - Welcome to Hope Center. - Nice to meet you. You're in the right place. Stick your tongue out. Just going to check your eyes, okay? And now look at this one. I'm just going to check your bag, okay? No drugs or alcohol. Or you'll be expelled immediately. If you have anything, let me know. Okay. How's it going in here? Good. Listen, I just want to give you an idea of what's gonna be going on over the next week or so. When was your last use? About six hours ago. So, in the next few hours, you're going to be experiencing withdrawal. And you know what that's like already, though, don't you? Yeah. Okay, well, it's gonna get worse, but you won't be alone. By the fifth day, the drugs are gonna be out of your system. You're gonna be clean. That's when the real work begins, okay? Okay. If those keys are going to make noise, just set them down somewhere. I just need to find the right pocket. Do you want the stethoscope on? Yeah, let's see it on. Carson is at the beginning of the detox process, and, physically it should be getting easier for her, but psychologically, the challenges are only just beginning. What she's been doing with drugs is self-medicating. And as she begins to go through recovery and clean the drugs out of her system, she's gonna lose this coping mechanism. Ironically, her mood and her behavior could get worse as she gets clean. And has Carson talked to you about demonic possession? I've had people come into this office and tell me that they were aliens. I had a woman sit right in that chair and tell me that she was Marilyn Monroe. So I prefer not to take their claims seriously and legitimize those delusions. All of that sexual chocolate. All of that, all of that. I just got to stay lean and mean with my, coffee and cigarette. Hey, Callie. - What's up? - How are you doing? I'm doing all right. Wanted to talk to you for a minute about Carson. That's that... that's that new little girl? Yeah, that's the new little girl. Well, I haven't really talked to her much. She doesn't talk to anybody. Can you say that, like, in a complete sentence, like, "Carson doesn't really talk to anybody"? Carson doesn't really talk to anybody. So, what if I told you she thought she was possessed? Can you talk about that? You know... I actually think that's kind of fucked up. I don't... What... what exactly do you think... "fucked up"... again, can you just put that in a complete sentence? Carson needs help. I see. She doesn't need you. Most of you guys know how we start out evening group, but we have somebody new here. So, you know, before we start, we always introduce ourselves by saying our name and why we're here. Eric, why don't you start us off tonight? My name's Eric. I'm here because I got popped at the airport. So now I'm missing my band's tour. Which is fucking great. Why are you really here? I'm a heroin addict. I'm Felice. I'm an addict... crack cocaine. I'm Callie. Um, I've been doing coke and alcohol since college. Hey, I'm Adam. I'm dually addicted... drugs, alcohol, sex. Combination of the three usually works the best, um... I'm Judy, and I like scotch, and I have to say that I'm an alcoholic in order to be here. Hi. I'm Julia. I'm an addict. I do coke, crack, LSD, MDMA... everything. Carson. Heroin, pills... Opana 80s, Klonopin, and Xanax for about a year now. So, you're the demon girl? What? - Callie, that's enough. - What? They said she was possessed by a demon. It's normal to feel like that. We all do. It's not just a feeling. Okay, I'm sorry. I know we're on TV and everything, but this is fucking stupid. We're taking Carson's feelings seriously. Carson? I don't know, there's stuff out there that we don't know. Who's to say she don't got a demon? Like, she do some crazy shit like she got a demon, so maybe she got a demon. I mean, who's telling me it can't happen? You know? Like, I don't know everything. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not gonna lie as if I do. She doesn't want to talk to me, but she's talking to our P.A., Jason. Jason. Yeah, we will. You got it. Now it's recording. Um, you see the indicator there? Yeah. And if you don't like looking at yourself, you can just flip it back this way. But you need to at least start with the screen up so you can make sure you're framed, okay? Okay. So, once it's on, um, you just start saying diary stuff, things you might not feel comfortable saying with other people here. Private, personal stuff that I only want to share with about 3 million viewers? Yeah. I guess it might have some therapeutic value. You can say how you feel. You can let off steam, whatever. It's kind of like your own personal friend. Anyhow, um, when you're... when you're done, you just, push that button. Going back to school? Next year if I can make enough money. And then you, what, make movies? More likely, I get the same job. But, you know, the grand scheme of things. Yeah. I remember the grand scheme of things. I was gonna be a marine biologist. You still can be. We'll see. Um, here. You... you try it. I think you got it. I-I think you're actually gonna be okay. Yeah? Yeah. For He has given us the spirit of power and self-control. For He has given us the spirit of power and self-control. For He has given us the power of spirit and self-control. For He has given us the power of self-control. Given us... Spirit and self-control. For He has given us the spirit of power and self-control. Self-control, self-control. Detox has been really hard. I'm sore, I'm sick, and I don't know why I'm here. I said I'd try this, but I-I-I know it's not gonna work. I'm doing this for Mom and Dad, so at least they'll be safe. But the bad feelings are coming back. They're coming back, and I don't know how to stop it. It gets worse before it gets better. You don't know. Believe me, I know. I've faced this before. I've been doing this for 25 years. I'm trying to warn you. I appreciate that. But right now, just tell me about these feelings that you're having. Carson? Let's, um... let's stop for today, okay? There she is! Hey! - Hey, Carson! - Hi! Hi, Carson. Give me a hug. I-I don't like being touched right now. It's just part of the withdrawal, right? - That's right. - Okay. Hey, this is a real nice place. - They got tennis courts. - It's gorgeous. - It's nice. - It's beautiful. Yeah. You're looking good. You're getting more of your... you know, your color back and... yeah? Yeah. Are you making some friends, you know, connecting with some other people? Your... are there some people around here your age? I'm sure there are. Yeah? How about... how about we pray for a minute, we pray together? Okay. Let's... let's just put our hands together, okay? All right. Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on... Stay here. Carson, Carson! Steve! My God! Okay. For the record, today is October 12. This is Carson's third day here. Step Inside Recovery is not helping her. She's not getting any better. I found these in Carson's trash. Everything is about death and violence. Here's another one. Fuck! I'm so sorry! What are you shooting? Nothing. I'm... nothing. I'm not shooting anything. Aww! My God. Look at this. Get that. Look, something's going on with her. She just puked right in her mother's face. Yeah, well, that's what happens in recovery, Jason. Everybody pukes in recovery. How many times have we seen this? Tons of times, hundreds. Now take my stockings off your head, and let's go see what she's doing. So, we are... all of us, when we get out of here, you're gonna deal with slippery people, slippery places. You're gonna need some tools to be able to deal with that. So, what we're gonna do here is a little bit of a role-play where Eric is going to be one of those people for Carson. Eric? You want to get high with us? No. Why not? I don't use drugs, and... I'd appreciate if you wouldn't offer me drugs again. And if you do, I won't be able to hang out with you. Fair enough. Let me talk to the demon. What? Well, you said you were possessed. Let me talk to the demon a second. I bet he wants to get high. Here, demon, demon, demon, demon! All right, Eric. That is unproductive. Step out, please. Carson, you did really well at first. You got a little bit flustered, but that's okay. You made good eye contact. You said all the right things. I mean, this is what we've got to do. Look, I was just trying to do the exercise. It's okay. Look, Carson, the purpose of this kind of exercise is to trigger feelings. What? Tina misses you in hell. - What? - And she's waiting. - She's waiting for you. - Carson, stop it. You fixed her last shot. Man, how do you know about Tina? No! How does she know about her? Eric, Eric, listen. I don't know. You let her die. Hey, leave him alone. Felice, you filthy cunt. You left your daughter with a drug dealer, and he fucked her ass. - What?! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Carson? Carson... stand back. Give me some room here. Shanti, get me 50 milligrams of Phenobarbital. Get back, get back, get back! Carson, can you hear me? What did I say? You insulted them. They said you got in the patient records and... I didn't get into patient records. I know. I can't... I can't control it anymore. If something bad happens, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm concerned. Carson's become a far more disruptive presence than I expected... a high-maintenance patient, brings the others into her drama. And having a camera crew around here is not helping. I know. I understand. And if it's too much, then we'll pull back. I don't want to be disruptive. Is it okay if I ask a question? Why not let a priest do an exorcism? No, no, no, I-I mean, if it doesn't work, then she won't have that excuse to argue with anymore. Well, if... if we feed the delusion, then, what have we really done for Carson? We've just taken the reason that she's here in the first place and swept it under the rug. We've just kicked it down the road. Yeah, but if it works, then, you know, maybe you really cured it. She has all the signs. And just what are the signs, doctor? Really? Okay, well, drastic changes in personality and voice, seizures or convulsions, loss of memory, inexplicable bites, bruises, or injuries, unnatural or superhuman strength. These are also the symptoms of mental illness. Well, speaking languages she doesn't know? Your concern is admirable, okay? But if you really care, you'll let us help and not make things worse. She doesn't need a witch doctor. What she needs is detox. She has detoxed, and she's getting worse. People usually get better. Hi. Excuse me. - Yeah. - Hey. Can I interview you, regarding Carson? Yes, absolutely. Great. Did you put that under Carson's bed? Hey, come on. I saw you on the hidden cameras, and I saw you making a cross on yourself when she was sick. Do you think this is more than just a drug addiction? I've seen this before, okay? - Here? - No. In my village in Cameroon, when I was a young girl. It was a lady in my church. She was just like this. Do you remember what they did to help her? Yes. They tied her to the oldest tree in the village. They prayed over her, and they covered her with the blood of the goat. I know it sounds crazy to you, but we beat her with sticks, but the demon would not leave. And this worked? It did. It worked. But the woman, she died. Great. Hi. I don't know what to say. Are you watching this, Jason? I wish we could have met before all of this. I used to play this game with my friend McKee at the mall. We'd see how much free stuff we could get. Not like shoplifting, just... free samples from the food court and perfumes and stuff, and... just wish we could do stuff like that... normal, ordinary stuff. And over here we have our resident demonologist, Jason Herowitz. Fuck off, Tim. Dude, did you steal those from her room? Go away. Today is October 15. I got my hands on... I got my hands on this holy water. I'm doing this to prove that something real is happening to Carson. I pretty much let all my family down. Um, my progression through the years from marijuana, alcohol, hallucinogenics to the harder stuff. Um, my life became unmanageable. When I'm... when I'm high, I... just opens my mind, man. I can write for hours. Since I've been in here, I can't even string together a verse. Either makes it better, or it just numbs you. Like, that's what I used to use when I had sex to numb me out. I don't want to feel shit. I don't want to look at you. Like, I don't even want to know you're there. Like, you're gone, and then I know. It's the pain that's inside. It's eating you. And I hate being here. I don't like you. Like, all of you. I don't know you. I don't give a fuck. I'll only ask that you don't get too caught up with your feelings. The people here in the room. This is a time to work on yourself. Feel useless. You might feel like that today. You might not feel that way tomorrow. I'll never come back. Well, what are you running away from? Just have fun in destroying yourself? And want to kill yourself every day? How fun it is. Fuck you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Back away, back away. - My God! Geez! - Back off. - Give her some room. - What?! Everybody, back off. Jason, get away from her. She's having a seizure. Dear God, take her out of the darkness and into the light. Dear God, take her out of the darkness and into the light. Shanti... are you okay? - Fuck! - Suzanne. Hey, hey, will you just stop? What? What? What? "How are you feeling, physically?" Like shit. "How are you feeling emotionally towards the doctor and the process?" Like shit. Yeah? Hello? I heard you were out of the infirmary, but I can come back later. No. It's okay. I was just... I don't even know what to say to it anyway. What's up? I just... I just wanted to say that... I believe you. You're the only one. Yeah? I wish I could actually do something for you. - You could, but... - What? I can't ask you to. What? No. It's not fair to you. Just tell me, and I'll decide. This... it's not working. I'm not getting better like this, and I need something. Okay, what? I don't know any other way to control it. I can't do that. Carson, hey... It's... it's okay. It's okay. Everything will be okay, all right? Okay. Okay? All right. Carson. Carson, what are you doing? Carson, stop. - You want to fuck her? - What? - You want to fuck her? - Carson, knock it off. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - What happened? - My God! Are you kidding? - What happened to your hand? - Carson did this. - That is fucking disgusting. - Yeah. Did she have a knife or, like a carrot peeler? She, like, bit my finger. We need to tell someone. We need to get her some kind of real help. This girl's freaking out. - We should be filming. - What, tonight? - Yes. - But it's almost midnight. I don't care. You're gonna wake everybody up. I don't care, Tim. You heard what Dale said. Go with the possession or "get the goods." Then we'll decide if she needs a priest or a straitjacket or what. Does anyone have a problem with that? Shh. Keep it quiet. Carson? Carson? Carson? Fuck! - Where the fuck is she? - I don't know. - My God. - Come on. That's her! Where is she? Hey, you guys see that? Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Fuck. Look, she's not out here. - We just need to get to... - Just hold up... shh. Did you hear that? - Carson! - Shh! She's not out here. I want to go back. Listen. This way. Come on, come on, come on. Suzanne, Suzanne, stay there, stay there! No! Where are they going? - Where did they come from?! - I don't know! - There's lights over here! - Follow them. - Tim! - Tim, go, Tim, go! My God! Carson, Carson, Carson! Hey. Was that the nurse running away? Carson, can you describe what happened to you tonight? - What happened? - They were trying to help me. Who was trying to help you? Will you back off? Jason, who were those people running away? - What were they doing to you? - I'm not gonna tell you. Who are those people running away? Will you help me? Get over here and... Well, I just had to fire my head nurse. Hope you got that on your cameras. Look, I'm... I'm recommending Carson for transfer to a psychiatric hospital. So you're giving up, in other words? We're not equipped to deal with a case... So get equipped! Bring in more staff! God knows you get paid enough! Hey, I handle five addicts pro bono for every one of these... Bullshit! Just spare me! We're all whores here, all right? This girl is my responsibility! She is seriously ill, and you people have been covering it up. - You're putting her life... - Fucking condescending! In danger! You were the only reason she has a chance! Well, I'm making the medical decisions here. Okay? Now, I've ordered a full psych eval tomorrow. And I fully expect that I am going to be recommending Carson for transfer. Great. And I will recommend to Dale that we use another facility in the future. Cut the fucking cameras! - Where are you going? - I got to run some errands. Can you, cover for me, please? Where are you going? You going to get more holy water? Tim, they're gonna institutionalize her. Yeah? Do you realize what's gonna happen if they put her in a psychiatric institution, man? She's not crazy! If she's not crazy, they'll let her out. Bullshit! They'll lock her up and throw away the key. Will you stop trying to save this girl, you dumba... Take a deep breath, please. Good. One more. Okay, thank you. So, how are you feeling today physically? I'm feeling better. I mean, I feel that the worst part of the withdrawal is over, so... Good. Have you been feeling depressed, anything like that? We spoke, previously about being possessed by a demon. I guess it was like a metaphor for that bad part of me that I felt that I couldn't control. Okay, well, let's take your blood pressure. I-I was checked earlier. - It was fine. - It's okay. We need to take it again. It's part of the exam. - What's this? - I... God, I hate this. This is the worst part of my job. I'm gonna have to expel you. It was the only way. It is never the only way. You knew the rules when you came into Hope Center! Let's go pack your bags and call your parents. Wait. She didn't do it. I did it. What? It was when she was unconscious. Okay? You brought drugs into my facility? Look, John, look, it's the only way to keep her... You shit! Out! Okay, I'm firing him. He's fired. It's over. - I realize what he did... - It doesn't matter, Suzanne. - Was totally out of line! - Look, this is not just my job. - This is not my career. - I know. I get it, I get it! But, John, let's work something out! It's over! Hey, you hired him. Shut the fuck up, Tim. Get that goddamn camera out of our face! What is your reaction to what's happened here today? Reaction? You want a fucking reaction?! I'll give you a fucking reaction! This is my reaction! You people are looking at a major lawsuit here! It's Monday. From what I can tell, she still hasn't left the house. I... I keep thinking about the way that Carson attacked her friend at the intervention. There's definitely... definitely something weird about that. Wednesday night. Nothing. Hello? Beth, it's Jason from the show. I need to check in on Carson. What do you want? Where's Carson? She can't talk to you. Look, what you're doing is not safe. You've got her locked up out there. She hasn't left the house in a week. You don't know that. I've been watching the house. I'm gonna hang up and call the police. No, no! Listen, Beth! I have not done anything wrong, okay? Look, I just want to help her. Wait. Hold on. Beth, what is it? Beth, what is that? Fuck! - Sorry! - Sorry! Beth? Beth, are you there? Shit. Fuck. Um, excuse me? Trespass much? Hi. Yeah, McKee. I just needed to interview you again. Producer said they needed a little more material on you. Is that okay? Should I change or something? No. You look great. The blue is great with your eyes. Thanks. They're hazel. Great. So, you told me before that Carson got weird, and so you stopped hanging out with her, right? But you said you were still friends? Yeah. Okay, so, then, why would she attack you at the intervention the way she did? I don't know. I mean, she's crazy. I mean, did you ever do anything to her that would... No. Look, McKee, I-I want you to be able to have a voice here, and I want to be able to hear your stor... I-I told you my story. I mean, I didn't do anything to her. I don't know why. Like, I think you should ask her that, because I'd like to know. Well, your friends have already said a lot. I mean, you really don't want to look like a liar on national TV, okay? Okay. Fine. We teased her. That was it. I mean, we didn't think she'd take everything so seriously. Teasing's not a big deal. What did you guys really say? We told her that we believed in Satan. And, you know, if she was such a Christian, then why did she still want to hang out with us, you know? Yeah, but... but she wanted to fit in. I get it. I mean, it was mostly Kylie and Mark. They kind of wanted to see, I guess, how far she'd go with the whole thing. But, I mean, it wasn't real. Like, it was just a joke. She took it so far. What exactly did you do, McKee? What... what did you do? Nothing. I... we teased her. - Like, that's it. - Okay, look at me. I'm not fucking around. What did you do? We didn't do anything, okay? Whatever happened to her happened to her because of whatever she brought in the room with her, okay? You can see from the video it was all just a joke, okay? Wait a minute, wait a minute. There's a video? There's a video? Yes. There's a video. You're gonna make me look really bad on TV, aren't you? Okay. My God, they got her. This is gonna be so awesome. Shh, shh, shh! She's coming. Yeah, this is gonna be so much fun. You're gonna love this. We do this all the time. We've done it a bunch. Yeah. It's not lame. It's a joke. Shh, shh! "Codex daemonix." It's the book of the devil. It's the real thing. - Do the chant. - Yeah, let's chant. Everybody repeat after me, okay? Silence makes the demon come alive. Silence makes the demon come alive. Silence makes the demon come alive. Satan natas. Satan natas. Drink the blood of the sacrifice. Demon Moloch, we offer you this vessel. Welcome him into you. - Keep going, keep going. - Keep going. Moloch. Come into me, Moloch. Moloch? - Get her the hell out. - Go! Go! Go! - Let's go, let's go! - McKee, McKee, come on! McKee! McKee, come on! You just left her there. Do you know what you did to her? Do you know what they're gonna do to her? I didn't know, okay? McKee, I need the book. What book? The goddamn book you used in that ritual. What are you gonna do with it? Get me the book. Okay. All right, I got the book. I, downloaded some exorcism stuff from the internet. I'd like to have a priest there, but they put you on a fucking waiting list. And... Jesus Christ, this demon is real, and nobody's helping her. What? Do you have one of our cameras? Yeah, I'll bring it back later. I needed it. Needed it for what? To find out what happened. Bring it back right now or I'll call the police! Look, I'm going there to help her, and then you'll get your camera back, okay? You're not going back to that house, Jason. You're gonna bring that camera back. What's the plan? The plan is to get the footage and call the police. My camera, please. - Go. - Keep it down. - Ready? - Do it. What's happening in there? - What do you want? - Where's Carson? I think I told you that we don't want to be part of your television... - Where is she? - Hey! Where do you think you're going?! - What the... - Look, we're not... What the hell are you doing here? I told you that I want you people out! Stop it, stop it, okay?! - Where's Carson? - I'll show you, I'll show you. Just stop it! Is that her? Yes. Shit. Go, dude. Go up there. - Shit. Go. - My God. Just follow me. I'll stay down here and give Steve his "father of the year" award. Get an OTF and some cutaways too. Okay. Copy that. Carson? The camera crew is back. Hey, I got it, I got it. Carson, it's me, okay? It's Jason. Can I come in? Fuck. Here, put the camera down. Just see if you can see under the door. Carson? You see anything? What have you done? Okay, Beth, get some water and some towels. Get water and towels now! Steve? Yes? We're gonna do a quick little interview, okay? Would you like a pretzel? - No, thank you. - No. Carson, can you hear me? Hey, Carson? What'd you do to your face? Carson? Hey. She's not here! That's not true. Yes, she is. And I know who you are. Your name is Moloch, and you can be sent back from where you came. Okay. Here goes. "Ever merciful and forgiving Lord, "accept my prayer that I, "Your servant bound by sin, "may be pardoned so that I can undertake this battle "in Your name. "I cast you out, unclean spirit, "along with every satanic power of the enemy. "Begone, and stay far from this creature of God, "for it is He who commands you, "He who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven "into the depths of hell! "I cast you out from this servant of God! Jason! Jason! Jason! Steve, where's the breaker box? - Fucking lights. - God! I'll show you. Come on. - It's not working. - It's not... it's not working. Steve, the lights are on. Fuck it, fuck it! Where you going? Where you going?! I'll be right back! Jesus Christ. Come on, come on! Fuck! Carson? Jason! Are you okay? - Come on! Get up! - Yeah, yeah. - Put your arm around me. - Okay, okay. Come on, come on! Come on! Where is she? Where is she?! I don't know! Tim! Tim, what's your 20, buddy? Careful. Tim! Shit. Tim! Where's Steve?! - I don't know! - Carson? Carson? Carson, it's me, Tim. Is that you? Carson, my God, come on. Come in the house. What... is that? Carson, what is that? Put that down! Carson! Put that knife down! Carson! - Carson? - Tim? Carson! - Jason, take this. - All right. I'm gonna go find Tim. Don't go anywhere. Be careful. Tim! Tim! Um, Jason, we didn't... We didn't tell you the truth... When you interviewed us. Carson is... Carson is violent because she was raised in violence. Beth, not now. We have to find Carson. We've always had a violent home, and, it's Steve. He drinks. And when he drinks, he takes it out on me, and... and I take it out on Carson. God. God, God. My God. What have you fucking done? Fuck. Carson... I know you're in there! Suzanne! Tim! Tim! What the fuck? Tim? Jason?! My God! Jason? Jason?! Cars... Carson. I know you're in there, Carson. Please! My God. Carson! Carson, I know you're in there! I know you can hear me! I know you can hear me! Don't give up! I'm here! I'm not leaving you! Fight it! Come back to me, please. Jason... It's over. You came back for me. Of course I came back for you. Steve, no. My God! No! My God. Jason! - Jason! - Carson! - My God! - Carson, Carson. My God!
