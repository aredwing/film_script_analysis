If it was close, let's go again. - How many times do I have to beat you? - You beat me? - Yeah, I beat you. - All right! You won! - Hey, leave your father alone. All this exercise is makin' me hungry. - Come on, Dad. All right, you won. - No, no. - You won. - No, you won. - No, no, you won. - No, you won. Mr Childress, telephone for you, sir. On the terrace. Better get here as soon as you can. I'll tell Peter. What'll living in the States be like, Dad? I don't know. We've been away a long time. - Yeah, it's been since Mum died. - Yeah. - Hey, why Chicago? - Good school for you. The best. - You could go out for football. - What, give up soccer? Well, football's more popular in the States. Football players are more popular with the girls. Dad... I don't know, school and sports, all that stuff... I just won't fit in there. I feel like some kind of a freak. What is this? Maybe if I knew what was wrong with me... There's nothing wrong with you. I might do OK in a zoo. What the hell are you doing? Feeling sorry for yourself? OK, you have a talent that would shock the hell out of people. But it's a talent that also can be put to good use. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Childress understands this. That's why he wants you to go to this school in Chicago. You'll meet other kids that are... special, like you. Robin... I'll be with you. All the way. If it doesn't work out, we'll do something else. Robin... do me a favour. I wanna talk to your father alone. One minute. - Sure. I'll be on the terrace, Dad. - OK. Peter... You've gotta give me the telephone number of that dame from the antique shop. There's nothing antique about her. Everything works. - Gonna miss you. - Well, I'm not gonna miss you! 20 years together in the same agency is more than enough. Well, you taught me a lot. You did. If this is gonna be a teary farewell, get your ass outta here. No tears. All laughs. Say goodbye to your son alone. Uh, waiter! Regular luncheon for two. (Machine gun fire) (Screaming and gunfire) My dad! Get Robin outta here! - Dad! - He's all right. He's a professional. - They're after my dad! - They're after all of us. For Christ's sakes... Dad! They killed my dad! Oh, son, I'm sorry. They killed my dad! Robertson, where the hell are you? Gimme the gun! I'll find out who broke that security. - I'll check... - No! Get this boy outta here. Come on, Robin, move. Let's go. Into the car. It'll be all right, Robin. It'll be all right. (Tyres screech) I'm sorry, sir. It's all right, Jonathan. You did a very good job. - I'm proud of you. Go by the road. - Thank you. Sure. Give me the film. (Radio) 'It's already 87 degrees this morning...' (Woman) I said, "Mother, what do you want from me? "You got this terrific job. You're all over the world." I get to see her once a month, if I'm lucky. "OK, I'm happy for you. I really am." But I said, "Just don't try and run my life "when you happen to be around the house for a few days "and feel like playing Mum." Mm-hm. I know. They just don't know how to let go. And they get so hurt when you try to explain. Really! Anyway, let's see if you know this junk. January 10th, 1946. That was the first United Nations General Assembly that was held in London. Right? - Good. - See, I told you. I never forget dates. All right... Who was elected president of the assembly? It's names I have trouble with. Uh... - LaRue, don't tell me! - I didn't say anything. Yes, you did. You said "Raymond". I heard you. I did not. "Raymond"? His name wasn't Raymond. It was, uh... Raymond Dunwoodie. Who was Raymond Dunwoodie? I don't know. It's just... That name just came into my head. I don't know. - So what was the real answer? - Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium. Oh, yes! Paul-Henri Spaak. - I always get that wrong. - OK, next. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council are... The United States, Russia... I know! Let's just forget the whole thing. - Forget it? Are you crazy? - LaRue, I know this stuff. - We have a final at two o'clock. - And I'm gonna pass with flying colours. I promise you. Hey, guess what. We got a buddy. Oh, my God. What a creep. He's walking backwards now. - Should we give him money? - No! God, what do you take me for? I don't know. Oh, he's not gonna bother us. - I hope we pass. - Sure! Two popcorns, please. - 'Hello?' - Mr Johnson? - 'Yes.' - It's Raymond Dunwoodie. - 'What is it, Raymond?' - Now, look, I haven't changed my mind. There's nothing I can do for you personally, but I may have somebody to locate your son. 'You'd better not be wasting my time.' No, look, I'm at the beach, and I made a contact. She's a kid, maybe 17, and she's psychic. - 'Are you sure?' - That's right, she's psychic. 'Bring her here.' I don't have her yet, but I could get her. Now, look... Mr Johnson, this is gonna cost. 'How much?' I don't mean 50 or 100 bucks, not for this girl. - 'How much, Raymond?' - $1,000. 'I don't have that kind of money.' 'That's a sad story, Mr J. 'Almost as sad as the story you told me about your boy.' Dunwoodie paid off. We've completed the trace. He's talking to Sandza at the Plymouth Hotel. - Step inside, off the street. - Yes, sir. - Is this man registered here? - I don't know. - L just came on a half-hour ago myself. - We think he's been here a few days. You ain't the police, is ya? Well... I'm what you'd consider well-traveled, but I've never heard of you gentlemen. We don't spend a dime on public relations. Yeah, well... That would be Mr R.V. Johnson. Room 512. Just down the hall to your left. Hey, government man! Don't bust my door down, please. Use a passkey. Chase One to Chase Two. He's loose. Do you copy? He's loose. Do you copy? Chase One to Chase Two. He's loose. Do you copy? (TV) 'Gunmen of the Hanafi Muslim sect 'continue their siege of three Washington buildings.' (Cat miaows) Goddammit! Did you hear that, Vivian? Huh? Now that's what I'm talkin' about. Them bozos in Washington are muggin' the whole damn country! Every court in the land helpin' 'em make it legal. (Vivian) If you asked me what happened to the milk of human kindness, I'd have to tell you frankly that the whole world has dried up at the tit. You can say that again. I swear to hell I don't know... - (Woman) Vivian! - Yes, Mother Nuckells, I'm coming. Couldn't you just once manage to go potty by yourself? - Vivian, somebody's in my room! - Oh, sure! All right, now. Nobody's gonna get hurt. - I just want some clothes. - He came in my window. Do you know who he is? I told you we should have moved to Melrose Park. This wouldn't be happening if we lived in Melrose Park. You... want clothes? Old clothes, anything you've got. Well, you can see I need clothes. I can't go anywhere like this. - Just the clothes? - Yes. Oh, I had to leave the hotel in a hurry, so... could you spare a couple of dollars? I knew it. This is a graphic example of biofeedback. We're converting the very low-voltage alpha-wave energy into electricity to run that train. And that train will only run when my friend Hester is in alpha. Now, as you may have hoped, there are more practical applications to biofeedback training. If you can regulate your brain waves, you can control your heart rate, blood pressure, headaches, backaches, even, ladies, cold feet. I work at the Paragon Institute, where we study the phenomena of extrasensory perception. And we are using biofeedback techniques to tap the almost limitless resources of the human mind. And I am speaking now of such things as thought transmissions, commonly known as telepathy. Now, that machine is called a magnetometer, and it records the fluctuations of the human electromagnetic field during our experiments, and I guess Hester's had it. Thank you, Hester. I wanna stress that no particular talent is needed to achieve this. Anybody can achieve alpha... with a little patience. Wanna try? Sure. Try to remember that "alpha" is another word for "passive". Right. Visualize sitting in an empty theatre in front of a blank screen. And let that screen fill your mind. - OK? - OK. - What is she doing? - I have no idea. Don't mind about them. It's OK. Are you all right? Creep! I'd say I'm pretty sound, considering the ravages of time. For instance, I don't have the use of any more than one of my limbs or vital organs. Good thing the Lord God Jehovah built in so many spare parts. But when the old ticker gives out, that's it. Ain't that the truth? - How long do you think you'll be staying? - Oh, shut up, Vivian. - Let the boy enjoy his breakfast. - Thank you. - What is it they want you for? - I'm a high-level security risk. Ooh! (Bell rings) Did you get it yet? - No. - It's been over two months! Would you shut up, Betsy? It does not! I mean... - Gillian, I was saving that seat for Cheryl. - Too bad. - Cheryl can sit over here. - Oh, God. Cheryl, I'm sorry. I tried to save a seat for you, but Gillian just took it. - Look, have my seat... - Hey, watch it! Good Lord, Pam! If you're that nervous, why don't you masturbate? Are you ready for tomorrow? You two are so sweet! When are you getting married? See any ghosts today, Gillian? - Cheryl, you're not very funny. - Gillian's not very funny. There are more mature ways to get attention, don't you think, Gillian? Have you seen Mr Wadkins' new girlfriend? Yeah, where'd he pick that ticket? Read my mind. - What? - Tell me what I'm thinking. Come on, right now. Read my mind. That's what they say you can do. No, I don't know how to read minds, Cheryl. It's ridiculous. - Cheryl, just... - Shut up, LaRue! I only wanna find something out. That's all. All right, come on. Oh, great! Now pay attention, everybody. Gillian's gonna perform. I didn't say I'd... Cheryl, I don't know anything about reading minds, all right? I mean, I don't even know what I'm thinkin' most of the time, so... get off my back. - Gillian, you're so full of shit. - Cheryl, you're an asshole. Just shut up. She can't help being upset. She has to take it out on someone. What did you say? You don't want everyone to know that you're pregnant? What? I would like for you to explain that little remark. Just what do you think you know about me? I'm sorry, I didn't... - Tell me! - Let go, Cheryl. Let go. - Tell me! - Please let go. - Cheryl! - Tell me! No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (Screaming) Help me! I put some cookies in a bag for you. - You might get hungry later on. - Thank you. How's your hair? Dry yet? Oh, it's fine. - Hey! - Oh, just fine. That Shinola will wash right out. I'd appreciate it if you'd wait till after MASH to let them go. MASH? I'll wait till Sunrise Semester: Might as well just leave 'em there. They ain't got anything to say I wanna hear. I've heard it all before. Peter? Uh, that's your real name? That's right. Can't see a reason why you'd make up lies to tell me. - I don't matter, anyhow. - I wouldn't lie to you, Mother Nuckells. You know that. Then I hope you find your son. If he's alive... I'll find him. And if the Feds get in your way, shoot 'em. Just shoot 'em. It's all they deserve. There's so many of them. They just keep coming. Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Now, don't overwork yourself, Mother Nuckells. It's bad for the old ticker. Thank you. (Muffled cries) Would you let us outta here now? No? - (Muffled) Please! - Get us outta here, do you hear? Let's go check that out. - That's all the way down. - OK, man, I dig. Hey, man. Check out Pops. Let's see what the old man got in the bag. Watch One to Top Guy One. Visual and clear. Do you copy? - OK, let's have the bag. - He's got a gun! (Woman) Come on, I wanna go home. - (Man) Home with you? - With me, yeah. I'll never go home with you. Come on. - I don't wanna go home! - You're gonna go home right now. (Car horn) Hey, how's that for a horn, huh? - (I Orchestral music) - But listen to that stereo. You ever heard better fuckin' stereo sound in your life? (Man) How can you be sure it's Sandza? (Childress) He had to be in the neighbourhood. All we had to do was wait. I trained with him. I know his style. What's he doing now? Over. 'Looks like off-duty cops in that Cadillac ahead of us.' There's nothing he can do now. - Can I help you, Pop? - You're under arrest. What? You're under arrest for impersonating police officers. Hey, hey, look out! What the hell...? He's got a piece. It's in my armpit. All right... what do you want me to do? Drive down that alley. Fast. Crazy son of a bitch! Take a right! Head for Long River Drive. Faster! Holy shit! - Should I drive a little faster? - No. Slower. Slower? Right now you're the only two people in the world I feel safe with. I wanna enjoy your company. Yeah, OK, sure, sure. Why not? We'll just cruise around a little bit. Maybe after a while you'll wanna talk. Yeah. What's your name? - Peter. - I'm Marty O'Brien. Is that gun too uncomfortable in your armpit? No, no. I want you to meet my partner, Officer Eggleston. Uh... hi, Peter. Why don't you call me Bob? Hi, Bob. Nice car. Yeah, it's brand-new. L just picked it up about a half-hour ago. - I wouldn't want anything to happen to it. - I don't blame you. Uh... - ls that shoe polish in your hair, Peter? - Yes, it is. It's a disguise. - That's a pretty clever disguise. - Yeah. It didn't work, though. They were waiting for me. Must have been waiting all day. I gotta give that Childress a lot of credit, the son of a bitch. Somebody's after you, is that it? What do you suppose he's telling those cops? Whatever it is, they won't believe him. I worked for a government agency you never heard of. They took my son away from me. They needed him, so they just took him. Keep your hand in your lap, Marty. It's a frightening power these people have. They can make anybody disappear any time. - Somebody's gotta stop 'em. - Yeah, that's right. If you don't mind me making a suggestion, maybe we can help. Yeah. You see, Marty and myself have had a lot of experience with... - People like kickin' people around. - Harassin' them. I got an idea. Why don't we stop for some coffee? Don't stop! Let's get the hell off this drive! We're like sitting ducks here! Easy, man. We're on your side. We're just tryin' to help. Chase One to Top Guy One. We've got him on the Lower Drive. Copy? Chase One, copy. We're right above you. Two sedans have been following us, standard government issue. - He's right about that... - Bob! - I want you to lose those cars. - Lose? How do you suppose l...? There's a construction site over the bridge. When we get there, I want you to follow my instructions exactly, understand? Bob... If they can make me disappear, they can make you disappear too. Chase cars... Pull up alongside the Cadillac. Let's find out what Peter has in mind. Something's goin' on here. Do they look like Feds to you? Who knows? Peter, I'm worried about that gun goin' off by accident if we hit a bump. Got something to worry about. Across the bridge when the light changes? We're not gonna wait for the lights to change, Bob. - We're not? - Go! Oh, God, please, God, don't let anything happen to my new car. Chase One to Top Guy One. He's crossing bridge into fog. Losing visual contact. They're finished. Let's go home. That son of a bitch! - Hey, watch where you're goin'. - I can't see anything in this soup. - Which way? - I don't know. - You go straight and I'll go left. - All right. - Now what? - Dunno. Hear anything? I don't know. Do you? Yeah, I definitely hear something. (Car horn) Chase One, we're in pursuit of the Caddy! I see him. I see him. He's over there, around to the right. - Jesus! - How the hell was l...? (Car horn) There they are. Go on, get movin'! (Peter) All right, get out. Both of you! Leave the motor running. - I can't believe it. Not a scratch! - Throw your pieces in the lake. What are you gonna do now, Peter? If you see Childress, ask him if it was worth his arm. What happened to his arm, Peter? I killed it with a machine gun. - Hey, Peter, now wait... - Tell Childress to follow me! I want him to follow me this time! Not in my car, man. - Watch out, Bob! - Peter, let's talk about this! Gillian, I know you're upset, but it's silly. I was told Cheryl has a history of nosebleeds. An ice bag stopped the bleeding. But what I'm trying to tell you is: I made it happen. - Oh, that's impossible. - What about when you started bleeding? Remember, a couple of weeks ago? You said the cut was healed, and it opened right up. Don't! Why not? Cos it could happen to you. Gillian, I've had a long flight, and I'm very tired. - I want you to stop carrying on like this. - Don't be mad at me. Sweetheart, I'm not. I always thought we could tell each other anything, no matter what. We can. Mother, I love you. I'm afraid! - Afraid to let me touch you? - Yes. Honey, I'm home and I'll stay here just as long as you need me, I promise. But what we really should do now is talk to someone. And Steve Brenneman has had wonderful success... I'm not going to a psychiatrist! (Phone rings) - Hello? - (Heavy breathing) Oh, it's you. (Coughing) Oh, that was a good one. Really passionate! 'I... I need...' Listen, I'm a nurse, and if my phone's tied up and they can't get hold of me... So, maybe you could breathe for someone else tonight. I... I need... I need... I need your body, baby! 'Come on, baby, it's me!' Oh, my God! Why do we always have to meet in this van? Couldn't we go to my place, just this once? (Peter) Too dangerous. Well, for the sake of argument, let's assume that everybody at the institute has their phones tapped. Nobody's watching me, for heaven's sakes. They're always watching. Raymond Dunwoodie was a psychic. If he'd had enough time, he'd have found Robin. But Childress was watching him. How else do you think they got to me? Why are you so afraid of this guy? I'm not afraid of Childress. He's afraid of me. He knows I'll get my son back. Now what about those files? Aw, I'm nobody. I just work there. I don't have access to any vital secrets. You mean, you didn't get a chance to examine the files at Paragon? - Yes, I did. - And? Robin is... - Well, he's... - Dead. - According to the records... - Of course that's what they say! - Childress keeps the records! - What if it's true? Hester, look at me. I'm proof. Proof that my son is alive, else why would Childress be so anxious to put me away? They've got him somewhere. You're the only one who can help me. How long did you follow me around before taking a chance on me? Too long. Thanks. Thanks for pickin' me. Oh, Hester, you don't realise how beautiful you really are. Somewhere they're doin' a hell of a lot of research. Much more complicated than Paragon. God only knows what they're doing to my son. Peter, if Robin is still... I promise I'll do everything I can to help find Robin. But you take too much for granted. You trust too many people. Paragon Institute! It sounds like a haven for quacks. - But their references are good. - It's right up there on the left. Gil, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced this is not an appropriate course of action. Mother, I like Dr Lindstrom. Anyway, I'm old enough to know what I'm doing. Well, I don't intend to let you stay here until they've answered a lot of questions, - and I mean that, Gillian. - OK. - Hi, Gillian. - Hi. - Mrs Bellaver, I'm Ellen Lindstrom. - How do you do? - Please come in. - Thank you. Dr McKeever is busy monitoring a test, but he should be with us shortly. - Maybe you'd like to look around. - Thank you. I've been here before. This was Babe Gifford's house. Yes, we bought the house from the Giffords. It was so beautifully furnished, we tried to make as few alterations as possible. As a matter of fact, Gillian's suite is particularly attractive. I don't understand why you want Gillian to stay... That was my idea, Mrs Bellaver. Gillian and Katherine Bellaver, this is our director, Jim McKeever. How do you do? - Gillian. - Hi. Young people stay with us all the time while they help with our evaluation programme. Thanks, Ellie. We can do a better job of judging psychic ability if there's a minimum of distractions. Of course, it's not all work and no play. There's a good library right here and a game room down the hall. - Do you play backgammon, Gillian? - Yeah. Good. And our housekeeper is the best Irish cook in Chicago, I'm sorry to say. I'd like to know what kind of programme you're talking about, Doctor. Certainly. Why don't we look at one of our workshops? Telepathy is a timeless form of communication. Now my five-year-old daughter was very good at this. But the older and more sophisticated we become, the more we rationalize what our senses try to tell us. This is all Gillian will be doing? Yes, this and similar tests, under my personal supervision. We'll take good care of her, Mrs Bellaver. I'll be fine. Don't worry. I'll see you in a couple of weeks, OK? All right, but I'll call you the minute I get to Paris. - You know where I'm staying if you... - Yes, Mother. I'll be fine. Good bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mrs Bellaver. - Nice meeting you. - Have a good trip. Oh, my God! It's beautiful! Do you like it? Look at this! Ah! It's great! I'll start unpacking. Look around, make yourself comfortable. This is beautiful! - "Paragon." The best there is, right? - Something that can't be equaled. Like the incredible power of the human mind. We hope you learn to use that power to develop your gift. It's not a gift. It's more like having a bad tooth and never knowing when it's gonna hurt. That's because a part of the mind you've never used before becomes sensitized. - Sensitized to what? - The bioplasmic universe. Come again? The bioplasmic universe. In that universe is a record of every human impulse, word and deed. Of lives past and lives to come. Occasionally you make a connection between the timeless world and the physical world. You have what clairvoyants call "a vision". But it's never about me, though. I never see anything about me. Guess I'm glad I don't. I've been thinking. We should have a little treat. - Just for ourselves. - What? Hot fudge sundaes, vanilla and chocolate ice cream... - Hester... - Bananas, maraschino cherries, coconut, strawberry topping, - whipped cream all over the top... - No, stop. Ta-da! Oh, my God! You guys! If I don't finish these tests soon, I'll be so fat, you'll have to roll me outta here! - Well, have fun. - Thanks. Come on. You've earned it. You're right. What the hell. Besides, what are you talkin' about? You look terrific. - Not after this. - Do you have a boyfriend? No, no one special. What about you? Pretty slim pickings around here. - Yeah, Paragon is just a job. - Well, do you have a boyfriend? - Have I got a boyfriend! - What's he like? Well, he's very charming. Swept me right off my feet. - In the park. - In the park? Yeah, he picked me up in the park. What was his line? He said he needed help. Some line! - What are you talkin' about? It worked. - True. What does he do? Do? Well, he... travels around a lot. Where? Well... all over. Oh, when he comes to town, we go to... parties. He loves people. He takes me out dancing, buys me presents... Oh, he dresses beautifully, and he's a good dancer. The only trouble is... he's very hard to get hold of. Oh, come on. Let's dig in. You mean gross out! Look at this! Mmh... When I was your age, I had one great ambition. - What? - To be Fred Astaire. Oh, my God. As you can see, I failed miserably. I took dance for a couple of years. My mother insisted. You see, she didn't think I was any too graceful... Agh! Don't touch me anymore! Please don't touch me! Oh, God! God! What happened? (McKeever) Tomorrow we do real tests, make things as challenging as possible for Gillian. Nelson, as soon as Gillian begins to demonstrate her psychometric talents, I want complete audio and videotape records of the tests. Will she be working in the Faraday cage? No, this girl's not a cheat. She's the real thing. Now... Do we have any bleeders in the group? (Kristen) No. Anyone who's had even minor surgery in the past three months? - How about ulcers? - (Hester) Uh-uh. Hester, Kristen, Lorraine... If you're into your monthlies, I don't want you around during testing. - (Kristen) Are you serious? - I'm very serious. (Ellen) Gillian's power to psychometrise is spontaneous. She creates an enormously powerful electromagnetic field. Almost everyone exposed to it will bleed. Some will bleed a little, some a lot. (Kristen) What is this kid? A vampire? You wanna continue working here? Then I don't wanna hear any more funny remarks like that. - (Kristen) How do you account for it? - (McKeever) We can't account for it. (Ellen) Not yet. Gillian... can you hear me? It takes a few moments for the Evipal to take effect. Ellie, please. Gillian... what did you see on the stairs? A boy. Robin. Have you seen him before? Yeah. I have. Gillian and Robin were in touch telepathically. Think what we would accomplish if Robin were alive. - I'm sending her home. - Jim... - Why? - I don't wanna be responsible for Gillian. - I don't think you mean that. - I don't wanna talk about it anymore! It's late. And we're both overexcited. Listen, I don't understand something. This is a marvelous opportunity for us. We only had Robin for a few days, but I think that Gillian really wants to work with us, and she is the best subject for psychic research I have ever seen. Ellie... Even the most backward tribes, the most primitive cultures on Earth, would welcome the birth of a Robin Sandza. And in time he'd become their magician, their prophet, their great healer. There is no place for these kids in our culture. They're superior to what we hold sacred. And what a culture can't assimilate... it destroys. Jim, what really happened to Robin Sandza? He was running on the steps, takin' them... two or three at a time. He... ...slipped and went through the window. But why was he running? I don't know, Ellie. I wasn't here. Jim... Why don't you come up to my place? - I mean, I'll scramble some eggs... - No, I'm, uh... I'm gonna finish this. Then I'm gonna stretch out on the couch for a couple of hours. Um... what time is it? My watch has stopped. It's a quarter after four. (Y awns) Oh, excuse me. It's later than I thought. Thanks, Ellie. Well... Good night, Jim. Good morning. What do you want? My arm hurts. It's dead. Why should it still hurt? You're the brain expert. So, tell me. Is it all in my head, Doctor? It's an oversimplification, but there's nothing I can do. That's not why I came here. Tell me about Gillian Bellaver. My people always know what's going on here, even if you're slow to keep me informed. Will the girl be another Robin Sandza? - No. - Really? Poor Peter. If he only knew that Robin doesn't care anymore, doesn't care if his father's alive or dead. - What the hell have you done to that boy? - He's being treated like a prince. He is. He's royalty, unique. The Chinese don't have one, the Soviets don't have one. In all the world, there's no one quite like Robin Sandza... unless it's this girl. How can you hold him against his will and get any kind of results? Against his will? You don't understand Robin's needs. We do. Are you testing the girl today? She's failed every test. She's a fake. I'm sending her home. - I don't have time to waste on people... - Don't do that to me, Doctor. Don't ever try lying to me. For God's sakes, she's just a child. She doesn't know anything. She has no control over what she's doing. Robin had no control when he came here. Just raw ability. Doctor... I wish you could see him now. For God's sakes. I want you to get yourself together, stop fudging your responsibilities. This girl is important to me. I'm assigning extra security. Why? If I know Peter, he penetrated your security weeks ago. He probably knows I have Gillian Bellaver. I don't know who his confederate is, but I'm looking into it. Oh. - She's all right. - Try that one. I will, I will. 'Kristen, where's Dr McKeever?' 'He's checking out the new testing equipment.' - 'Do you know when he'll be back?' - 'He said not before dinner.' - 'Where's Gillian?' - 'Having breakfast.' 'I could use a cup of coffee myself.' A club... Good morning, Gillian. You're not eating much. I'm not very hungry. Did you hear what happened yesterday? Dr McKeever's hand started bleeding. Yes, I do know about that. Well, what are you gonna do about it? I mean, it's why I'm here, isn't it? Can't anybody help me? Gillian, we have to work together. Gillian. Do you remember much of what we talked about last night? Last night? - Were you here last night, Dr Lindstrom? - That's all right. While you were with Dr McKeever, you had a vision that upset you. You were in a fugue state for a while. We gave you something to help you relax, and I suggested that you consciously forget whatever was troubling you. And apparently... it worked better than I thought! So you don't remember anything about Robin Sandza? No. Who's Robin Sandza? He's a boy your age... with powers like yours. Like me? Well, where is he? I mean, do you think I could talk to him? Do you know him? I feel like I do. What can you tell me about him? He's... He's not very clear. He's... He's, like, dreaming or... ...or not... not awake yet. Drugged. Stop! Just relax, Robin. Relax. It's gonna be OK. Gillian, where are you? Get that light off him. Disturbance of the magnetic field on the last PK. Trial was stochastical, with a parametrical resonance on a frequency of five cycles. We'll go for a magnetometer check now. The infrared scanning system is operational. We want a two-dimensional view of the field potentials. We have a mild electrostatic field fluctuation. We have differentiation between the P and T waves. Heart action slightly arrhythmic. Let me have that electroneurogram reading. Pulse 66. Pressure 114/92. Pulse steady at 67. Pressure 115/94. Robin, we're going to show you a film. Now, there's nothing in there that can possibly harm you, but you must keep watching, OK? (Man) Pulse beginning to rise. 73. Pressure 115/94. Magnetometer holding at 640. Pulse is 78. Pressure 129/111. No. Keep watching. Keep watching. (Man) We have a mild electrostatic field fluctuation. - (Woman) Body temperature 89.59. - (Man) Pulse steady at 65. Robin, please keep watching. No! No! Robin, please, for God's sake, watch the screen. Gillian! Gillian! Where is Robin now, Gillian? (Screams) (Machine gun fire) My dad! They're after my dad! Dad! No! Oh! Oh! Oh! (Ringing) - Hester? - Oh, thank God! Oh, my God. Listen. I need to talk to my mother. Do you think I could call my mother? You can talk to your mum in a little while, but you've had an awful shock, and you need to rest. - Here. - What is that? It's a sedative. It's like aspirin. You take aspirin, don't you? Here's some water. Drink plenty of water. Oh, that's a good girl. I need to see Dr McKeever. I have to know what happened to Ellen. He'll be here in a little while. I'll stay here with you. Just lie down and relax. No! No, I gotta get outta here. I gotta go home. It's all right, Gillian. Everything'll be all right. We'll take good care of you. Don't worry. Ellen's x-rays were encouraging. She's beginning to show signs of consciousness. - It had to be a cerebral haemorrhage... - "She's a fake." You were gonna send her home. Is that the kind of cooperation I can expect, Doctor? I want Gillian Bellaver at the PSI facility tomorrow. Do we let her mother know? She's wealthy, with powerful friends. Gillian can't just dis... Peter, it's impossible. I'll never be able to get that girl out of that place. I'll blow it. Getting out of Paragon is a hell of a lot easier than getting in. - What do I say to Gillian? - Tell her everything. Tell her what they did to Robin. They'll do the same thing to her. - What if she won't listen? - I don't have much time. That girl can lead me to Robin. - She was doped the last time I saw her. - Everything's set for tomorrow. Tomorrow? I need your help. Please. You feel all right, Robin? You know, that wasn't a very smart thing to do. You could have been very badly hurt. Why were you running away? You didn't have to use the window. There is a door. (Robin) Yeah, like they'd really let me just walk out the door! (Woman) Why didn't you come to me? Because you're one of them. I just wanna get outta here. I hate this place. I hate these doctors and the tests. They're driving me crazy. I can't even sleep. And you want to get away from me, too. Is that it? - What do you care'? - Well, I care very much. What's the matter, Robin? Don't you trust me anymore? I don't know. But you do want to get out of here, don't you? Yeah. All right. Then we'll go together. - Go where? - Gillian! (Woman) Well, I have this place in the country, north of Chicago, in Lakeview. Gillian? You can do whatever you like. You don't have to see anybody. You don't have talk to anybody. Not even me. Really? Yes, really. Would you like to do that? Sure. Gillian? Gillian? Hi, Hester. I've been lookin' everywhere for you. This was Robin's room when he was here. Yes, it was. He's in terrible trouble now. Those people, they should be trying to help him. What people? Where Robin is. They won't leave him alone. I mean, it was like they were deliberately trying to hurt him. - Hester, don't! - Please, please, it's OK. It's OK. I'm not bleeding. - You know where Robin is? - Yeah, I do. Would you like to see him? I need to see him. Well, I think we can work that out. HOW? Dr McKeever says I'm supposed to give these to you to keep you happy and harmless. - Do you know what I mean? - No. What...? You'll have to pretend you took them, because I have to get you out of here tomorrow. Otherwise you could be in trouble yourself. What are you saying? What is going on? Oh, honey, I've got so much to tell you. Would you like a drink? You look tired. I am tired. How's our Boy Wonder? (Man) Those films of his father's death have unleashed an incredible emotional force. He's developing the power of an atomic reactor. Or an atomic bomb. What are you giving him to calm him down? Every day he has 3000mg of phenobarbital and 1000mg of Prolixin. On trial days... (Childress) What the hell are you telling me? That's enough to kill him! (Man) Drugs no longer have any effect on him. (Woman) We've pushed him too far. He's quite unstable. - He flies into rages over nothing. - (Man) He could be dangerous. What's he trying to prove? (Woman) Mentally, Robin has developed this perfect psychotronic relationship with all kinds of machines. And so naturally he's trying to do the same thing now with his body. Except that physically, he's just... adequate. And when he fails... he's intolerable. How is he performing in bed? Robin wants to please me. That's the main thing, isn't it? He needs a rest. No more tests for at least a month. Sorry. He's been under tremendous pressure. We plan to get away, just the two of us. No. We almost lost him once, Susan. I promised. I promised him we'd get away, together. All right. Take him into the city. Show him the sights, but get him back here in 24 hours. (Laughter) Well, there you are. Who are they? These are friends of mine from the institute. Are you planning on seeing them later? No, Robin. I'm with you. Remember? Which one are you gonna screw first? Robin, come here. - Get away from me! - Robin, please. (Screaming) (I Fairground music) (Screaming) (Screaming) (Woman) Oh, my God! Top Guy Two, this is Top Guy One. Do you have any coffee left? Top Guy One, that's an affirmative. I've got about a cup of lukewarm coffee left. You wanna negotiate a trade? Uh, Top Guy Two, I have one Hershey bar to trade. Top Guy One, I read you. ls that with or without almonds? All right, Asshole One and Asshole Two, stop cluttering up this frequency. Isn't Dr McKeever back yet? Oh, I'm afraid not, Hester. He's still at the hospital with Ellen. Can I help? Dr McKeever prescribed medication for Gillian this morning, but we're all out of it. He was very specific about using a nonbarbiturate. - So I guess I'd better go to the drugstore. - Fine. Hey. - Are these ready to be mailed yet? - Yeah, why? I could take 'em to the Post Office for you. Oh, that would be terrific. I'd really appreciate that, Hester. Here, these go in. These have to be stamped. And that stuff. Whoops. Here comes the pony express! Oh, hi. Will you be gone long? - Oh, no! I have to go... - Shh. I have to whiz to the drugstore, whiz to the post office... I have so many things to do, I'll never get through the day. Oh, I'm silly. I can't go without the card. Where is the card? Where is that card? I haven't the faintest idea. - How's Gillian? - She's doin' just fine. That's good. Gillian... how about a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich? - OK. - Good girl. Damn! - Oh, I'll give you a hand. - Don't bother. - It's no bother. - I can take care of it. It's OK. Oh, for God's sake, move your ass! Oh, I'll get that, Gillian. Here's some more, Hester. I killed her. I knew I would, the first time I said hello... ...and conned her into helping me. She would have done anything for me. Hey, you better get some sleep. Don't stop. Please keep talking. I'm afraid to close my eyes. Afraid of what I'll see. - Sip this. - No, I don't wanna. Sip it. You'll feel better. That's the best thing in the world for a toothache. Tell me about Robin. You tell me. It's just that... sometimes I know what's happening to him, what he's thinking... what he's feeling. I'm... like a receiver, and Robin sends me pictures. Jesus, that's amazing. You're like twins. He's a good-looking kid. You're the kind of girl Robin would like. I raised him myself. His mother died at childbirth. How come you didn't marry again? Well, there just hasn't been anybody. Hester? Yeah. Hester. (Peter sobs) Hey. Hey- Hey, when was the last time you saw Robin? Oh, about 11 months. He's been growing up so fast. You know, I'm a good athlete, but he's better. The last day at the club, we raced in the pool, about ten laps. He beat me, but I said I won. He said "No, you didn't." I said "I did too." He jumped up on the side of the pool and said, "All right, we'll do it again. 20 laps this time." I was so dead, I could hardly drag myself out of the water. I said, "All right. You won, you won." Tell me, Gillian. How is he? He's OK. OK. Yeah. We're all gonna be OK. That's a promise. Peter! Stop! Please, let me off! I'm supposed to get off here! Peter! - What the hell are you doing? - You were gonna leave me! Now, look. You got me here. Now stay out of this. - He's my son. It's my fight. - I don't know who to trust anymore! Look, that bus'll take you to Seattle. I paid the driver. You'll be safe. You can't leave me! Get on that bus and stay on it! Peter! But I can take you to him now. Peter, I was lying before. Robin's not OK. He needs us now! It's too dangerous. People around me get killed. Dammit, people around me get hurt too! I make them bleed! Robin can help me. Please! Oh, Jesus! Why did you do that? I don't like it when you smell like this stuff. Could you just leave me alone for a little bit, Robin? I got tired of waiting for you. What's taking so long? I wanted to have a bath and a little privacy. But you're taking too goddamn long! Is everything all right, Dr Charles? Yes, everything's fine. When the others arrive, would you just hold them downstairs for a moment? I need a few minutes in here, OK? I'll call you. Thank you. Robin? I'm sorry. Try to understand the strain I'm under. I'm very worried about you. Don't be sorry. I didn't mean to act like that in there. It's me. I'm OK now, though. - I'm OK. - Good. Well, I'm starved. Do you want something to eat? Sure. Well, this looks great. I've been thinking, Robin. Maybe we should take a couple of days off. Get a boat, go up the lake or something. What do you think? Why did you do that? So nobody can get in. What's the matter, Robin? You know what's the matter. No, I don't. What is it? It's that goddamn girl! What girl? - The one that's like me. - What do you mean, like you? Oh, you think I don't know she's around? She's right out there. - There is no girl. - That's a lie! - No, it isn't, Robin. - She'll do everything I can do, won't she? And you won't miss me at all. What are you trying to say, Robin? - Company's coming. - Yes, you know that. There'll be you and me... ...and Dr Ives and Childress. And that girl makes five. No, only four, Robin. You can see that the table is set just for four. That's right. I won't be here. I'll be dead. That girl's taking my place after you poison me! What's the matter, Susie? What's the matter? - Oh, God! Robin! - Remember? I told you I didn't have to touch you to hurt you. Robin, please stop! - Well, I'm hurting you now! - Stop it! Cos I don't love you anymore! I'm tired of you! You're killing her! Stop! (Alarm bell ringing) (Gillian) Stop! " No! " (Barking) Susie, get up. - I said get up. - Robin! God, stop! I can make you get up. Turn around. Up. - Robin... - Up. Oh, God, Robin... Up. No, please. Turn around. Again. Faster. Faster. Faster! Faster. Turn! Again. Turn. - Faster. Faster! - (Screams) Here. Gimme your hand. Hi, pal. Thought I'd drop by to say hello. Long time no see. You're lookin' good. Ah, too bad, Peter. You almost made it. Where's my son? Why don't you give up? You... Oh, God! Shit! (Screams) Stop! Stop! All right, Peter. You said you wanted to see your son. Go ahead and get him. Robin? Can you hear me? Robin! Please answer me. Oh, my God. Robin! Where is he? What have they done to you? Son. I know they told you I was dead, but... they wanted me out of the way. I never gave up. I kept lookin' for you all the time. Come on, Robin. Hey. Don't you recognise your old man? Peter! No! Hang on, Robin. Reach up with your other hand. Come on. Grab a hold of my jacket. Climb over me. That's it. Come on. You can do it. That's it. That's it. (Screams) No! Oh, God! (Peter) Robin! All right. Get 'em outta here. Get 'em outta my sight. Good morning. I made some coffee. Would you like some? No? It's warmer by the fire. How did you sleep? OK? I was here most of the night. I guess you don't remember. Move a little closer to the fire. I know what you've been going through these past couple of days. I know how exhausted you must be. It'll take more than one night's sleep. I know how I feel. Peter was my friend. Maybe the best friend I'll ever have. But I had to do what I did. I mean, you saw what happened. Peter could have saved Robin. Instead, he let him go. He deliberately killed his son. I hope you dont judge me too harshly. I can't say what I did was right or wrong. I only know I acted... and it's done. Robin is gone. Peter is gone. And you're the only one who matters now. Yes, I know that hurts. That hurts so bad, you wanna lie down and die. But you have to survive. You're a healthy, strong, young girl. And you must survive. You'll begin by putting all the tragedies behind you. I think that'll be easier if you accept my help. All the bad things you heard about me just aren't true. I'm not a bad man. All I want is for you to trust me. Time will take care of the hurting. That's the simple truth. Tears are good. Don't be afraid of crying. Tears are just what we need right now. I'll be a good father to you, Gillian. You can depend on that. Gillian! Where are you? Where are you? You go to hell!
