I couldn't say no. Should I have? You betterfill the fridge before they waste you. Clean the damn dishes, there's shit all over. OK, OK... Hey... You'll be back for lunch? I gotta work. What's up, girl? Where can we meet? Son of a bitch! I just got my license. Fuck, my dad will kill me. It's OK. I'll handle it. It's an official car, no problem. Run! Where's yourfriend? You fucked up, bitch. You fucked up. OK, got it covered. It's OK, I'm a cop. Get in. Get in. Drop me off overthere. Thanks. Gimme a beer! What happened? What happened? He was a cop but a guy got out of his car and got rid of him for me. What did he have? Yeah, right. And the envelope with the money? - What do you mean no? - I mean no. This sucks, dude. No, grandpa. The knight can't move that way. - Why not? - Because those are the rules. Well they're shitty rules, right? Are you deaf? You two... Hi, son. How are you? Look at him.

Mr. Torres wants his 18,000. Mr. Torres. Wait. What's he pay you? I'll pay you double to leave me and go after him. - 15 out of 18. Not bad, right? - Not bad at all. Let's do the math? - And this is yours. - Great. If you need our help again you know where we are. Rocio, show Mr. Torres out. Nothing like a satisfied client. Sit down. - Did you have any problems? - No. You're a great guy, Abel. Great. Let's do the math? Forty percent of fourthousand five hundred... Perfect. So what do you think? Where'd you get all this? I kicked a rock and this was under it. Fuck off. Just do the math. All this will draw attention. It might not interest the Dutchman. It's all first-class stuff. I'm sure he'll be interested. Get 300,000 out of him and 20 are yours. It's a deal. Hands off. When you talk to the Dutchman, you let me know. Yes. What time's good foryou? OK, fine. Four o'clock? See you there. Ciao, genius, ciao. - What's wrong, babe? - He's cheating us. What? Don't be naive, Domingo. He plays dumb but he isn't. What the hell are you saying? He's always showing up short of cash lately. - He's screwing us, I'd bet anything. - Impossible. Think a second. The fag gives him the 18,000. He keeps 3,000. He comes here and says he only got 15. - No. - Just like that. - Wouldn't you do it? - Well no. - Abel won't screw me. Not him. - And if he keeps it all next time? No. He knows what would happen to him if he did. No. So just forget it. - Close that and check this one for me. - OK. Put the table back! Do it! Look, princess, your daddy owes us 20,000 Euros. If we don't see the cash by Monday we'll do him in and then we'll do you in too, bitch. Both of you. What was it this time? Nothing. I sold some stuff they brought me, and I paid off a debt I had with part of it. The other part I lost gambling. Hey, bring me a beer, come on... You're gonna get yourself killed. Don't even joke about that, honey. They just wanted to scare me. I'll fix it tomorrow. I got it all perfectly planned out, honey. This time it'll turn out right, I promise. I got it all figured out. It's the perfect plan. Hi, handsome. Can I come in or do we do it here? Fucking taxi driver. That asshole. Sure, go on, laugh it up. Are you alone? I'm already here so can I come in? How much? And 200 for anal. So? OK, come in. - What's your name? - Abel. And yours? Kay. Kay? - Kay as in Cay-etana. - Fuckin' A. You heard right. My dad's a real prick. When I was 4, he used to use me as bait to hustle. Sometimes it all went wrong and we had to change cities. Been here a year and a half. I met Nelly a few months ago and since then we work together. And you? What do you do? I'm a sort of debt collector, only unofficially. It's not great, but the pay's good. Well... - See you around. - For sure. I hope... Bye. Bye. Hey. You like pasta? CENTRAL ANTl-ROBBERY UNI You really paid They're python. A ram-raid in a furrier's in Sants. Sebas just called. He got in touch with the Dutchman. First things first. - Sebas, how'd it go? - Fucking great. He's in a good mood. No problems from him? No; on the contrary. If the stuff is what I told him, he says OK, it's a deal. And when is the exchange? Well... tomorrow's fine for me, if you want... Take care of it like it was your daughter. Of course. I... I wanted to ask you for a small favor. Some Mexicans burglarizing homes in Sarria are hassling me. They're bent on sending me to the otherworld. The bastards... They fucking almost did, OK? You gotta get them off my back or I'm fucked. We'll take care of them, but your share gets cut to 10,000. OK, no. 10,000 is fucking great. Stay and watch him. The phone you're calling is turned off... Shit. You were right, fucking great. I worked at an Italian bistro for a year. Really? Where else have you worked? At a repair shop when I was a kid. And later I was into boxing for a while. And I wasn't all that bad... Look. My first and last trophy. What happened? Nothing, my father had a construction accident. Wound up in a wheelchair and I gave it up to get a job. God... Looking to buy a house? Fuck, this one's awesome, it's gorgeous. It costs a million. But... check it out. It's beautiful... Yeah. Really. Invite me overwhen you buy it? Sure. My fucking hair. Want me to cut it? I was a hairdressertoo for a while. Jesus... Yeah... You're a real gem. A 24-karat one. - Yeah? - I have a job. Is 1:00 OKfor you? - I can't at 1, I gotta pick up Adrian. - And after lunch? Perfect. - Is that you, Kay? - Come on, open up. Fuck, where were you? Where? I asked you a question. - I was calling you all night. - Halleluiah. I usually have to call you to see where you are. I was worried, you know? Sorry. My battery died. OK? Wait, wait... I'm fucking sleepy. Me too, I didn't sleep a wink all night, Kay. - Remember I said I had a plan? - Again with the plan? Kay! It's serious this time. If it goes according to plan, we can make 400,000. But I need your help, honey. I can't do it alone. What do you say? Come on, honey... What are you doing? Leave the onion. You can't eat it without onion and tomato. Here. Have some fries. I don't like fries. These fries orfries in general? Fries in general. Really? Since when? - Always. - Your grandma knows? She doesn't make you eat them? Lucky you! Why? When I was a kid I hated cauliflower but she didn't let me get up until I ate it. She made it for dinner once; I spent the night looking at it. I don't like cauliflower either. Of course not. It's like food for cows. - Grandpa told you that? - Yeah. And that you moved like a butterfly, but stung like a bee. They used to say that about Mohammed Ali. But I wasn't even fit to tie his shoelaces. Grandpa says you coulda been the Spanish champ. Sure. Grandpa always says that, right? Yeah. OK, Adrian... I have to go to work. Don't I get a kiss? An espresso. Hi, my little Abel. What's up? How long have we known each other? Since I bought the BMW from you. Why? Two years. Problem-free, no mess, right? What's with all the questions? Rocio thinks you're cheating me. Says you're messing with me, keeping part of the money you collect. What do you think? I think I have a very important business. And I don't want to be ripped off. Are you taking cash? Don't trust Rocio so much. That's my business. Are you taking cash, yes or no? I only take my share. Two shots. His name is Lorenzo Fernandez. A 2nd rate builder, moves lots of cash underthe table. Our client is a brick supplier he's owed 120,000 Euros for a year and a half. But he's always with a thug that's also his driver so you be careful, watch out. Here. And get the full 120,000 so Rocio will stop busting my balls. I took my mom to the doctor's and couldn't call. I was going to now, I swear. Did you find the money? I don't care about it. I just want to know what kind of bills and the amount. There was 1,700 in hundreds. Well, 1,800 counting what he paid me for my work. Sure there was no more money at home? It's me. Has he moved? He hasn't left home all day. Wait, he just came out. He's got the bag. Follow him and keep your eye on him. Boss. Z-12 here, requesting two backup units. Well... tomorrow's fine for me, if you want... So, what do you think? Not bad. What do you want for it? Fuck, it's just a case of police corruption. They're not just cops. They're Anti-Robbery. We can play it up a couple weeks. With no political ramifications? It won't last us even 2 days. OK, I'll try somewhere else. Wait. We're interested. I can get you 60,000. No. 100,000. OK. - I need 24 hours to get it. - No. It has to be now. Impossible. This takes time. I'll call you tomorrow about where and when. What, you don't trust us? I don't even trust my father. Fuck... Where the hell are you? Fuck, dad. What, where are you? I got the cash but can't shake him. I need your help, please. Think of something, OK? Hurry up, hurry up. Fuckin' A... The fag gave him the 18,000 but he kept 3,000 and I bet it's not the first time. Call the Turk. Same guys working the Sarria area. Good job. Tell Lainez to leak the news. You heard him. He did the swap, went back to the store but tried to escape. What? Inspector, Ricardo Snchez is calling. - It's his fourth call. - Thanks. I'm on my way. Don't take your eyes off him. I've been calling you for 2 hours. They offered us a video. Of you giving the material to your pal the expert. My boss wants to buy the tape and publish the story. They meet tomorrow to seal the deal. It's not looking good, Garro. Fucking step on it! Wait, wait a second. I can explain... - Where's the tape? - What tape? I swear I don't know what tape. What the hell? - I want my money. - What money? I'm an idiot to think you came over 'cause you liked me. - What's this about? - The 1,800 you stole from me. Say what? I didn't steal anything from you. You were the last person at my place. Well rememberwho was next to last because it wasn't me. Fuck. - Wait, wait a sec. - Fuck off. Wait, please. I screwed up. I'm sorry, babe, I screwed up. What tape do you mean? I swear... - The tape or I'll kill you now. - I don't have it. - Tell me where it is. - Kay took it. - And the money? Where's my money? - She took it. - Tell me the truth! - That is the truth. Boss, there's nothing here. Take him away. Shit. Stay in case the girl comes. Let's get out of here. Get down. Stop! Police! Are you OK? Dad, where are you? Are you OK? Yeah, but where are you? I'm downtown. We have to meet. You have to bring the tape and the money. - He didn't give them the cash. - Then we stall fortime. Tell herto be here in 1 hour. In 1 hour bring everything to the abandoned factory at the entrance to Sant Andreu, honey. Fuck, dad. I put the money in a safe-deposit box. I can't get it until tomorrow. Listen up, bitch. The longeryou take to get it to us the worse for your dad. Do anythingstupid you won't see him again. - Do you hear me? - I hear you. Tomorrow at 11, same place. 1 minute late and your dad's a dead man. I can help you. I'm not too smart at some stuff, but I'm good at these things. First, we have to switch cars. Got a pen and paper? THANKS Our plan: Sell the tape to the press to get rid of the cops. We'd get them off our backs plus we'd keep the money and jewels. We could have got almost 400,000. Plenty to just disappear. - A good plan. - Yeah. A fucking great plan. But my dad's plans always go wrong. He must be jinxed. Chema. Chema. What do you want? It's all my fault. Don't you do anything to my daughter, OK? She's just a girl and none of it's herfault. Why do you stay with him? He's my dad. Yeah. He's never left me on my own. When they get the money and the tape they'll kill him. Don't feel like helping me anymore? No. Farfrom it. Plus I need some help too. Tell Garro not to hurt her, OK? Will you tell him? Can you do me that favor? She's just a fucking girl. I can trust you, right? It's the fifth step. If they know about the money someone from the papertold them. The fucking bastard that objected so much. We can't do the swap without those cops showing up. If they do and we lose them, it'll be easierto rescue my dad. What? You ran away from home? I'm talking to you. - You sure kept it quiet. - It never came up, right? She your girlfriend? What do you think? Do we make a good couple? Yeah? - What's up? - The light doesn't stay on even 1 min. - Careful! - Dad! Dad! Dad, are you OK? I'm fine. We gotta get out of here. We need to find a safe place. Don't worry, it's just kid's stuff. No, he better stay with me. OK, see you tomorrow. I'm going to get something to eat. Time to sleep. Listen... It's betteryour grandparents don't know about this, OK? Why'd he want to kill you? Someone thinks I tricked him but he's wrong. I haven't been the best dad in the world, Adrian... but I'll never leave you alone again. I promise. He's an Argentinean thug they call the Turk. My boss uses him when someone needs to be killed. - Why'd he send him foryou? - I don't know. I guess his wife convinced him I keep some of his money. And do you? No. She wanted us to get involved. Wanted me to kill Domingo to take his money and his business but I said no. What happened? I mean to Adrian's mom. You left her, she left you? She left me 3 years ago. We'd gone out for dinner and drinks. She said get a cab, I said no, that I was fine, I could drive. The light turned yellow. The car just appeared and... I couldn't brake. She was in a coma for 2 months. And she finally left us. I'm sorry. What's wrong? I can't go on with Adrian here and the Turk after me. He's my son. I can't let him down again. Then let's think of something. I need your help. I need your help. It's complicated, but I have an idea that just might work. Yeah. I need yourfriend to help us out. I'm back. What's up? You scared us so much. Don't you ever do that again! I'm sorry. OK... I have to go now. - I wanna go with you. - Listen, Adrian... You said you wouldn't leave me alone again. And I won't. I think Adrian and I need to spend more time together. OK? Get your stuff ready and I'll come get you this afternoon. Rocio asked me to kill you. She wanted everything for us but I said no. I have never stolen from you. Call the Turk. Yeah? Yes, it's me. at the La Farga mall. The girl will bring the cash in a black bag. Got it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it. OK. Go get Beln. What happened? What did Abel tell you? You don't believe him? Domingo... I swear I never... Domingo... Get lost. I want you gone forever. Garro, it's me. The girl called. They're doing the swap. at the La Farga mall. What's our girl like? She'll be carrying a black bag. OK. That bitch wants to sell the tape. Stay here and watch him. Let's go! Shit. Are you blind? I braked but the car didn't stop. Well, it's not that bad... - You're insured, right? - Of course. Women, they're all the same. Wait! Fuck! Who are you? Mr. Diaz wants his 120,000. - Morning, Mr. Fernandez. - I don't want any calls. Hi, can I help you? I'm just killing time. That's it. Excuse me. - How dare you? - Sorry. - Get out! - I'm very sorry. Where'd she go? All of it. That's not... All of it. What are you doing? Police. - Hey, that's mine. - Calm down. Calm down. Thanks, dude. Can I help you? Those bastards! Come on! Hey, but... You're fucking kidding! - I was told to deliver it personally. - Hang on. Tomorrow's fine for me, if you want. Take care of it like it was your daughter. Don't worry. Get back here. Check it out. Fuck! - Let's go get my dad. - Grab the cash. Yeah? Everything's quiet here. When we're done I'll get Adrian and we'll go far away. Don't worry, it'll work out. OK, fine. What's wrong? Finish that. Let's make a deal, Chema? Let me go and I'll give you half. Come on, Chema, 150,000 Euros. Almost there. Hold on. Hold on tight. Run! Here! I'll give you 200, 200,000, OK? No, man, take it all. I'll give you the 300,000 Euros, you can have it all. What is this? 300,000 Euros! What's going on up there? Chema? I'll get Adrian and I'll be right down. Wait for me. So how much did you get? If we take off, he'll neverfind us. Look, look, hon, the keys are in the ignition. An opportunity like this only comes once in a lifetime. You and me, babe, together, like always. Dad. Mom? Adrian! Mom... Drop the gun. Drop it, pretty boy. Where's my son? OK, OK. - Where's my son? - I don't know. Only these two were here. Brave guy your old man. Tried to defend himself, ya know? Anyway... Wait, wait, wait. What's Domingo paying you, 20,000? Domingo? "Finish the job. I'll pay you your money. Rocio". Wait, wait, listen. Let's make a deal. I'll pay you double. Double to leave me and go after her. Does that hurt? Don't worry, I'll shoot you in the head and you won't feel it. Look at me. My son, where's my son? Where is my son? Where is he? What happened to you? And grandma and grandpa? We have to go. What happened? Adrian, get in the car. And your dad? He had his own plans. Let's blow this joint.
