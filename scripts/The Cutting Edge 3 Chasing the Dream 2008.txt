ROB ON TV.; But what else is new? But what else is new? Night is young and we've just begun to see ROB ON TV.; Oh, look at this. Big marks for Bright and Halyard. Feeling you baby Thinking that maybe Only Zack Conroy and Celeste Mercier can catch them. And speaking of which, it's America's gold-medaI hopefuls, Zack and Celeste. And it's showtime. One more time I'm feeling you, baby Thinking that maybe it's time for us to go, girl Come on, Zack. Let's go. Let me guess. - You had company last night? - And some fun it was. All she wanted to do was talk about skating. Really? Now, that's a big surprise. ROB ON TV.; And so, the gold medal goes to Bright and Halyard. - They are the Pan Pacific's... Second. I hate second. Well, I hate second, too. But come nationals, we're gonna be right there, you know? Oh, my God! My ass is sagging. Look! Looks good to me. Let's go.

Get back. I believe this just about sums things up, kids. Yes? No? Anyone? Jason and Cindy cannot beat you again in Miami. - They won't. - Well, they did in Tokyo. Forget Tokyo. They were flawless, we weren't. If we execute, we win. Not with the routine we're skating. Here we go again. "They're tired, they're old, they're boring. " We've just skated it too long. - Yeah? - We gotta do something... - Less boring? Funny. Bryan doesn't think I'm boring. That's because he's busy trying to get in your pants. I'm serious. Bryan's routines are not just dull for me. You deserve more. - You mean you deserve more. - I mean we deserve more. What "we"? We're over and that's fine. But this? This is business. Pretending to be America's Sweethearts? It's a joke. Maybe, but it pays the bills. When did it become all about the money? We used to be a team. A great team. Always a team. I'm so sick of this. I want to get back to how it used to be. Me, too. Good. Try something with me. Do you trust me? Absolutely. Yeah, I'll call you back. Zack, I'm not ready! Zack! No! Celeste? She's hurt! No, I want Hickman waiting for us at the hospitaI when we get there. Can we get a bit of privacy here? Please. What'd they say? They think it's a fractured ankle. So that's two months in a cast, and... A few more in rehab. So there goes nationals. - I... - No, it was me. I was stupid, and out of position. I should've stopped, but I just froze. I was going too fast. I was... I was pushing you too hard. What you said to me, about us always being a team? That was about the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me. Ever. Yeah. It's not good. Finally Your day begins Empty thoughts Willing to pretend I understand. Of course. See you at the nationals. Yeah. Well, he's not a singles skater. I know. He needs a partner. He's a dangerous skater, Celeste. He's always pushing it. It's a miracle something like this didn't happen sooner. Thank God it wasn't any worse. No, he's not dangerous. He's brilliant. But you got a fractured ankle, and I can't find anyone else willing to partner up with him. I don't believe that. Trust me, Celeste. I made the calls. And I just want to know... Come on. Let's get you to that doctor's appointment. And I just want to say That you're all right And I just want to hear You laughing And I just want to see Your smile again Hey! You son of a bitch! Are you blind? If you're looking for a dancing partner, there, mamacita, - I don't swing that way. - This is my ice till 5:00. Was your ice. I don't care if your grandfather owns the joint. We got it booked. - I swear... - What? That's all you got to say, man? Tell you what, there, cara de queso. Since you're not too strong on apologies, I say we put it on the ice. Then we'll see who's really sorry, huh? Let's go. - Let's do it. - Come on. Bounce if you wanna Just bounce and bounce And move if you wanna Just move, and move So all the B-boy's B-girls Hit the floor Bounce if you wanna Just bounce and bounce And move if you wanna Just move, and move Come on, B-boy's B-girls Hit the floor Here we go now Let's go, let's go If I can do it, you can do it If you can do it, they can do it If we can do it, what we doing Let's start moving Bounce if you wanna Just bounce and bounce And move if you wanna Just move, and move So all the B-boy's B-girls Hit the floor Here we go now Let's go, let's go Bounce if you wanna Just bounce and bounce And move if you wanna Just move, and move Come on, B-boy's B-girls Hit the floor Here we go now Let's go, let's go Is that all you got? Who are you, boy? And what is your point? Who are you, you... Who are you, boy? And what is your point? Who are you, boy? Who are you, you... Who are you, boy? And what is your point? Who are you, boy? And what is your point? Who are you, boy? Don't look back down Who are you? What's wrong with you? Hey, get... Get off me! - She's got good form. - Yeah. You guys are wasting your time. We're just looking, okay? You don't see me asking you to skate with any of them, do you? Not yet. Okay, what the hell's that supposed to mean? Please forgive me, Zack, for trying to further your career. You really want me to skate with someone else? It's the only thing that makes sense. Okay, and if we go to nationals and qualify, what do I do with this new partner? Well. It may not be such a problem. At least, not with her. Oh, no. Not the bad-assed Russian bimbo. Misha is the only one not afraid to skate with you, Zack. She called when she heard about what happened with Celeste. It appears as though she wants to leave Rudy. I contacted her people, and it can be worked out. She's the only truly qualified candidate, and she doesn't create a problem with my transition back. I get healthy, she moves on. She's a godsend. No. She's a misanthropic man-eater who neutered poor Rudy, and I am in no way volunteering to take his place. There. Look. You see what she's saying? "You slip up again, you SOB, and so help me... " Her lips aren't even moving. Well, that's because she's learned to talk - through clenched teeth, so she... - Enough. Bryan is setting up a meeting. And you will skate with her, and we will make the decision as a team. - This is business, remember? - Yeah. Damn. Oh, here. Let me get that for you. Here you go. You can't carry one at a time, hey? Well, not if we're gonna keep them happy. This place gets any busier, you and Pop are gonna have to get back to work, you know, and manufacture some new help. Don't even think of such things. Go back to study now. You've got a class tonight. Don't tell me. You came all the way here for the horchata? Well, I was thinking of trying the menudo. Figured I'd ask your opinion. Well, chiquititas like you should never eat menudo. In fact, they should stay away from any of the duskier flavors, if you know what I mean. How'd you find us, anyway? I looked up your league in the park's registry. This isn't exactly the first taco stand I've been to today. Good. Then lunch is officially over. Look, I just want to know if that girI on your team will skate with me, professionally, as a tryout. It's what I do. I know what you do, and I know what you are. I watched your grandfather develop the Conroy Center. Amazing how a nice little neighborhood had to disappear so you could have that fancy ice rink all to yourself, right? Right. Do you know what? I still want to talk to the girI. All right. Okay, listen. You want to ask Alex something, ask her yourself. You mind? - All right? Enjoy. - Thank you. Look, just give me five minutes. You're wasting your time. I don't go for guys in leotards. Okay, good. Then there won't be any romantic distractions. Let me ask you a question. Will you skate with me? Go on. What makes you think I can do it? When I saw you on the ice, remember? Or was that someone else? All you saw was my dust, baby. Not a great selling point for you. I was wearing figure skates. See? That's what I'm talking about. You know you're good, and so do I. Yeah, but that doesn't mean I can do triple-toes and salchows. I mean, I haven't worn figure skates since I was 10. Well, that's what coaches are for. Come on. You got nothing to lose. Oh, really? 'Cause I have nothing better to do than to make a fooI of myself in front of you and your friends. It won't be like that. I promise. - I have to get back to work. - Hey. Think about it. You could call me, or show up at the rink at 3:00. Yeah. Ah, Celeste. So when are you back? Four months. Give or take. Not untiI after Paris? Well, that has to suck. Yeah, I'll call you back. - I have exactly one hour, Bryan. - Not a problem. He's here. You're late. Would you be on time for your own execution? - Darling boy. - Misha. Great to see you, and glamorous as ever. - I try. - I know. - And how's Rudy? - Not dead. Yet. Bryan says you're afraid to skate with me. - Well, after Celeste's leg... - That was an accident. - I try to protect my partner. - Don't we all? Well, that's not what Rudy said. He said in Tokyo that you threatened to... How did he put it? That son of a bitch! I am going back to Moscow. - I'm so sorry. Are you all right? - Like you really care. - Ice looks good today. - Well, that went well. Very clever. Very neatly done. I just hope you have a reasonable explanation, or at least an alternative. - Can you just wait? - For what? For you to grow up? Meet the alternative. Dropped your phone. - Thanks for letting me use your skates. - Don't worry about it. It's not like I'm using them. It's been so long, I forgot how uncomfortable these things are. - All right. - Watch your edges, they're sharper. And relax. And don't forget about the toe... Picks. - Thank you. - Didn't see that coming. I'm good. All right, let's try some moves in the field. - Do you hear me? - Maybe not. What do you want me to do? Moves in the field. Three turns, mohawks, chocktaws, spirals, you know... Moves. Why didn't you just say so? Okay. Okay, so she's been watching some skating, and yes, Zack, she's an athlete. But she hasn't shown me anything I couldn't get out of a fourth-grade prospect. Oh, really? - Let me skate with her. - Be my guest. You... Are you comfortable? Sure, your coach made me feeI so at home, it's like we're family. Yeah. Here. All right. Arms straight. Okay, we'II... We'll work from strokes into crossovers, and... When you're okay with it, we'll throw in some jumps. Okay, then. Okay, there you go. - Are we good? - That all you got? Three turn on your left foot. Whoa! Hold on. Well? Sixth grade, maybe. Barely ready for junior high. That girI hasn't worn figure skates since she was 10 years old. You saw what she did in less than half an hour. Look, we gave her a shot. She's just not cutting it. Can we please try somebody else? I'll see you tomorrow. I saw it. And? You'll never have her ready in time... But there's definitely something there. Come on, help me in my car. You feeling okay, hijita? You don't have to play, ama. I know Bobby told you everything. Okay. So, how did it go? The coach was right. I have no place there. The coach, sure, but the other one. What did he think? He's still talking about skating with me and going to the nationals and to Paris. But he's a famous skater, and if he wants to skate with you, then that means something, no? No. Maybe. This is what you always wanted. No. Let me show you something. These were the most important things in your life once. You slept with them. You even wanted to wear them to schooI. But when we could no longer afford the lessons, you threw them to the garbage. It's okay to be afraid, mi amor. But don't let the fear keep you from doing what you were meant to do. It hurts too much, mami... To want something like that and lose it. You don't know how many times I cried myself to sleep. I know you cried. Because I stood outside your door and listened. And I cried, too. This passion you have is so much a part of your spirit. Had I known, I would have given my life not to have taken it from you. I know. There are few second chances in life, Alexandra. And this opportunity... Forget the risk and fear. You have to try. Okay, mami. Let's, um... - Let's try a platter lift. Do you know what a platter lift is? - No. - Okay, I'm going to put my hands down to your stomach. Down here. All the homies They know what I mean - Baby, let me show you how I lean - Like a cholo Lay back Bounce in the club When we do a dance, yeah We do it like what? Like a... Like a cholo Side to side Elbows up Side to side Side to side Like a cholo All up in the club Ten deep Lookin' for some hyenas We on the creep I need a bad one A real freak Find them at the dance floor So don't sleep Damn, I like you, I like you But a really want her She's that type I can tell Let me get in too deep Take her back to the hotel Side to side Elbows up Side to side I lean like a cholo Side to side Elbows up Side to side I lean like a cholo Side to side Elbows up Side to side Fingers on the track So when are you really going to start working with them? I'm not. When Zack comes to his senses and finds a reaI partner, we'll talk. You should work your quads more. Skating really stresses them. Trust me, I'm in a kinesiology program at the junior college. Thought I might like to work with some big, bad pro athletes one day. Yeah? Like me? I wouldn't call dressing up like Ken and Barbie "bad. " - Is that your press? - Probably mostly for you. I hope they don't think I'm your girlfriend. - What do I say? - Doesn't matter, as long as you smile. Hi, WIXB news, can we have a little chat for your fans? - Thank you so much. Right over here. - Of course. - So, how's the training going? - You know, it's coming along. We've been at it a couple weeks now. Starting to figure out the timing... We'll be ready. - Are you nervous about the competition? - I'm not his girlfriend. Press. Pain in the butt. Yeah, but you know, she looks pretty good. My prized ice shark has found himself a new piece of meat. Not a particularly choice cut, if you ask me. - Hey, that's my sister you're talking about. - Spare me the not-with-my-sister routine. Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Come again? Is this where we do the macho? - Oh, you mean like the dance? - Yeah, sure, how about if I lead, huh? Bobby, Bobby. Bobby, don't! - Come on! Come on! Bring it on! - This is WIX... Hey, you really don't want to get into it with him. Oh, I see. Is this where you protect your future brother-in-law? - This isn't cooI. - Let go of me! - Chill. - You know what? - We're through. - What? I told you this was going to be a disaster, but you never listen to me. So, you want to throw your career away, you do it. But do it without me. Life's been too easy for you, young man. You never had to work for it like the rest of us. That's why you'll never put it all on the line, Zack. I shouldn't have wasted my time with you. Come on, Celeste. I'll take you home. Get the camera out of my face. Did you get it? Hi, this is Bryan. Leave a message. So, did you get the twin turbos with the 18" wheels? - Yup. - Me, too. Beep, beep! By the way, my brother said to tell you thanks for breaking things up the other day. He's really sorry for how things turned out. No, that's all right. Bryan was asking for it. It was long overdue. Wait, what are we doing here? Looking for a gold medaI. Sabrina, no, no, no. Honey. No, no, no, no. Don't pull AbigaiI down when you're gonna fall down. That makes both of you fall down. Jackie. Well, well. What has it been, five years since Torino? And Zack Conroy finally sees he can't live without me. Hi. Or not. Alex, meet Jackie Dorsey. Your new coach. I'm sorry, what? Yeah, well... I'm not a coach. - Oh, no worries. She's not a figure skater. - Hey! You know, I'm going to go play with the big kids. - Okay? Yeah? - Okay, go. She's getting there. We just need some help. Jack, you don't want to be teaching kids to do T-stops - for the rest of your life, do you? - As a matter of fact I do. After my marriage and the injuries, these kids saved my life. - Hi! - That was some showstopper with Bryan. ESPN's been playing it so much that you should probably be getting royalties. So you're not entirely surprised to see us? No, and I was prepared to turn you down flat, but seeing you here, and her... - I'm more than a little curious. - Yeah? - So, you're a hockey player. - Yeah. So's my dad. - Dorsey. Doug Dorsey! He's your dad? - Mmm-hmm. Great hockey player. Yeah, he was a pretty good figure skater, too. Because he had a great coach. - You really think you can do this? - Well, with your help, who knows? Come on, Jack, do it for the old man. He was an outsider, and he became great. It's not about being great anymore, Zack. You have to be perfect. And what? I mean, what are you guys going to do for a routine? - Nationals are in, like, ten minutes. - Five, actually. I actually know all the routines from the last three Olympics. I memorized them all. You guys have to work seven days a week, and long hours, if you have any chance of getting on the ice in Miami. I want you breathing, eating, everything but sleeping together, from now untiI nationals. That's what my mom and my dad had to do. And let me emphasize the "not sleeping together" part. Well, Zack's more than welcome to move into the restaurant and don't worry. My brother will make sure he doesn't do any sleeping. - Sorry. - So? It's a hockey thing. Come on. Talk to me, can you turn me on? If I give it to you will you play me on? - Hey. - Yeah? - You did good in there today. - Thanks. Oh, these routines... - Have I seen these? - No. Not yet. If you talk to me Will you turn me on? If I give it to you Will you play me on? That sure is a pretty car you have. Yeah, and I think it looked especially sporty behind that shiny new tow truck. If I give it to you Will you turn me on? Hit it hard, come on 12.;30 is still kind of early For to slide in Hit the bar and order strong Islands Rum and Coke For my other folks There's a freak on the other side so that you know So, thanks for the ride. You live here? - Yeah, do you want to come in? - Yeah! Grab your gym bag, we'll go for a run. Wow. Yeah. How do you like it? Cozy. You can change in the bathroom if you want. Where? There's five of them. Take your pick. I share a closet with my brother, and this kid's got five bathrooms. All this belongs to your family? My grandfather. He and I are all that's left since I lost my parents. I read about that online. - You were three? - Yeah. Too young to remember. Most of my childhood revolves around places, not people, anyway. You know, big houses, city apartments, hotels and uniformed help. - Are you and your grandfather close? - About 15 miles. He flies in and out in his chopper. I wave as he passes. You're looking tired. I hope you don't mind me being nosy, but your girlfriend. Is she okay with what we're doing? You know that's hype about us being a couple. That was a long time ago. Zack, I know what my eyes tell me. And she cares for you as more than just a friend. Well, your partner is more than a friend. You sweat and hurt, and win and lose together. And, most of all, you have to trust each other with your lives. But that's just coming from a spoiled rich kid, so what do I know? Where you going, huh? What, do you think you can outrun me? - Zack! I'm warning you... - What? No! No! - It's cold! - Freezing! No heater. Here. Thanks. Yeah. Do you want some tea or something? - Yeah, sure. Yeah. - Okay. Should have warned me about the water. What are you doing here? I thought you were seeing the doctor. I figured since I got all this time, I might get this out of the way. - Nice car, by the way. - You're such a snob. Can you give me a hand with this? - So, have you spoken to Bryan yet? Nothing to say. You could have shown him a little more respect, Zack. He doesn't want respect. He wants controI. Be carefuI. - Don't let this girI fall in love with you. - Not likely. - She knows what I am. - Which is what? You're handsome, talented and rich. And you're a nice guy, which only makes it worse. Trust me. She won't be able to stop herself, and she won't know how to handle it. - I just want to skate with her. - Then skate. But don't let her get attached. I know what I'm talking about, Zack. Keep it business. So here we are. If you have any questions, you might want to ask yourself if that's more important than getting to nationals. And if you have to go to the bathroom, save it for after Miami. Okay, now I want you to keep your head up, and I want you to keep your leg straight. Good job. Try and get your arabesque a little higher. All right. I want you guys to do backwards crossovers. Please remember to keep your head up and, Alex, track Zack. Okay? Now go. One, two. One, two, one, two. Okay, okay. Good. Try again. Sharper. Alex, when you hold your hands, hold them up. Right there... I think crossovers are the same... Hey, Zack, you want some? My mom made it. Love the circle... Knees, knees, knees. Breaking up your timing in the lifts. That was better, that's better. Nice edges. More, guys, more. Again. Faster, faster. One more time, come on. Talk about a hard-nosed vibora. But we showed her, huh? Hey, I do something to piss you off? Look, I know we're working hard, but you barely looked at me all day. No, we're cooI. We don't want you sleeping on the couch, so... Mama set up a bed for you in the kitchen. There's a bathroom around back, and if you need a... Five, six, seven, eight. Didn't think I'd turn around and say That it's too late to apologize It's too late That it's too late to apologize It's too late I'd take another chance Take a fall Take a shot for you I need you like a heart needs a beat Hi. Yeah, yeah I loved you with a fire red Now it's turning blue And you say sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you But I'm afraid It's too late to apologize It's too late I said it's too late to apologize It's too late It's too late to apologize It's too late I said it's too late to apologize It's too late I said it's too late to apologize Yeah I said it's too late to apologize Yeah I'm holding on your rope Got me ten feet off the ground - Lock your arms. - Okay. Alex, chest up. Zack, you okay? - No. Zack? Zack! Oh, man. Can we break? Sure. Okay, that was good. I'm serious, I just need a minute. How about just take the rest of your life? Hey! Listen, I promised to skate for you, which I will keep doing untiI there is nothing left. And then... No. And then, I will get up and skate some more. I will never quit, and neither will you. You're too kind. Let's go. Hey. What'd you say to her? - Nothing, I... - No, no, don't give me that. Alex is the toughest kid I know. And now she's upstairs, crying her eyes out. All right, I'll go talk to her. Okay? No. Not okay. And mind your own business. Okay. Look... If you think you've made a mistake, just say so. - About what? - You know what. That I don't fit. That I'm not good enough. That you're wasting your time. You don't look at me. You don't talk to me. What? I'm a disease? Man. No, no. Are you kidding? Does it look like I'm kidding? Alex, you're unbelievable. PhenomenaI. And you're pretty, and smart, and more determined than anyone I've ever known. I just... I didn't want to give you the wrong idea, that I was... You know, trying to come on or take advantage. I'm just trying to be carefuI, because I don't want to hurt you. Don't worry. I don't break so easily. ROB ON TV.; And we're live from Miami, with the pairs figure skating finals, the premier event of the season. An evening that promises to be both dramatic and - decisive... - Decisive, as the top three pairs move on to the InternationaI Figure Skating Conference - in Paris. - How'd you do that? Hold on. Here's the part about us. In fact, anyone's first look at Zack Conroy and his new partner, Alexandra Maria Elena Delgado. - That's quite a mouthful. - And quite an eyeful, or so we're told. With a new coach and rumors of a romance, there is no doubt the world will be watching. But they'll have their work cut out for them against their rivals. Okay, we don't need to hear about them. No, 'cause you're gonna be seeing more of us than you can stomach. Oh, and you must be Alexandra. Is that Delgado as in the Tijuana Delgados? Cameras. Well, I see everyone's already exchanged pleasantries. Yeah. One big, happy, dysfunctionaI family. No hard feelings, Zack. Now that we've both moved on, I'll just have to console myself with these two future world champs. They're gonna have to beat us on the ice first. Beat you? I don't think that's gonna be too much of a problem there, Zacko, seeing how you're so good at crippling your own partners. Hey, hey, hey. We'll see you on the ice, Zack. Hey. I just wanted to wish you both the best. Skate well. ANNOUNCER.; First pair up, Bright and Halyard take the ice. These two really skate as one, don't they? They certainly do. And they've got so much strength and so much power on the ice, they are just a pleasure to watch. ROB.; Well, we've said it before, we say it again, Bright and Halyard look unbeatable. How are the collars? Is there any leveI threes in the footwork? No, not yet. But hold your spins. You might be able to pick up a bullet for revs. Yes! Yeah! And what a performance. Very, very strong. How's it feeI? - I think I'm numb. - Well, just keep breathing. You'll be great. What I love about this pair is their consistency every time they step out on the ice. Every single time, including from the beginning, the split triple-twist was awesome. They did a remarkable job today. Good for them. Congratulations. You were fantastic. Just a great performance today from Bright and Halyard. And, of course, this is all under their new coach, Bryan Hemmings. But I think this routine is firmly going to put them in first place. - Did we cover grade of execution? - It's covered. I'm ready. - ANNOUNCER.; Ladies and gentlemen... - Go for gold. Next on the ice, Conroy and Delgado. Now the time has come to see if Zack Conroy has found redemption with his new partner, or to see if the unfortunate loss of Celeste Mercier will continue to haunt him. Regardless, an outstanding performance from Bright and Halyard. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad, at home. We got it, guys. We got it! Take a look at these scores. - The judges definitely agree. - Whatever. Their scores are great, and they definitely have the crowd behind them. You know I trust you completely. You don't have to convince me. But for the hell of it, let's show them. And we are holding our breath here in Miami as Alexandra Delgado skates for the first time as a figure skater with Zack Conroy. This has been a difficult year for him. Let's see what this couple can offer us here on the ice. Center of your blades. What a unique partnership. Experienced champion skater, really, with a raw rookie. - We good? - Never better. Yeah! For the first time in competition together, this pair is confident. And don't forget who we're talking about here. I mean, this is Alexandra, an amateur hockey player, who has to be the absolute longest of long shots. I mean, this is pretty amazing. They look so comfortable. Fall. Fall. Cameras. So far And after all this time So far You're my kind of guy So far Everything is fine So far I know that your mine Watch each other. So far Everything is fine Watch each other. Oh, my God. Completely unexpected. Alexandra Delgado, first time out on the ice as a figure skater, and she's been hit. Don't move. Coming off the broken leg from Celeste Mercier, - and now this. - It's nothing. We have to finish. What's Zack Conroy feeling right now? He looks stunned. It's nothing, honest. Come on. - Let's take it from the spin. - Are you sure? Yes. And just when you thought you'd seen it all. Talk about courage. Come on. Come on. - You okay? You're sure? - I'm okay. Yeah, I'm fine. - If you're feeling bad, tell me. - Yeah, I'm okay. Zack, I'm fine. What an extraordinary comeback after a devastating fall. You have to hand it to this young new pair. Unbelievable. There goes coach Jackie Dorsey, she can't believe it either. Okay. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm okay. I'm fine. That was amazing. Well, go on, then. Wave. We love you! Well, the crowd doesn't like the marks. What? We didn't make it? Well, we took fourth. I'm sorry. I let us down. I got too close, and... - God, stupid, 'cause I was... - No. No, no, no. You were perfect. I lost it. Top of the world, guys! Top of the world! Hey, is it true you two are engaged? Celeste, is it really over with Zack, or are you going to skate with him again once the cast is off? One question at a time, please. And, yes, we are engaged, which I'm relieved to say only took two years of begging. Are you going to skate with Zack again? We'll figure that out when the time comes. But enough about me. You should be focusing on the gold medaI champs over here. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - So, Jason. Jason... - Just one second. Hey, Zacko! I was wondering... My hair's getting a little long. Can I get a trim? No? So, Paris! Tell me, how are you feeling about that? Excuse me. Excuse me. You're not gonna believe this, but third place just popped positive. - Sid Rotunda's been juicing. - So? So that means that they have been disqualified, which means that you... You're going to Paris? Zack? Zack? Zack! - Zack, we're going to Paris. - What? - We're going to Paris! - What? We're going to Paris. Some Verducci kid was juicing or something. But we're going to Paris! Oh, my God! - That's... - We're going! - That's amazing. - I know. - Need a cold one? - No. Listen, I know I've been giving you a hard time about Alex, but that's over, man. You're solid. And no one blames her for what happened. I mean, she's still learning. Listen, Bobby, that cut was my fault. I lost my concentration. That's an unforgivable mistake. - I could've really hurt her. - Yeah, but you didn't. And you were there for her. I saw how you took care of her. That's good stuff, man. Hello? Hello? Okay. Thanks for meeting me. How's it feeI? A little stiff. - This is heaven. - You really missed it. Sometimes I wish I never had to skate again. You think that untiI something happens, and then... All you can think about is getting back on this ice. I'm sorry you had to find out about Bryan and me the way you did. I wanted to tell you before your program, it's just there was so much going on, and I didn't know - if I should do it. - No, you know... You never have to explain yourself to me. Just tell me you're sure about this. - It bothers you? - Well, it's not like I don't know the guy. Zack, you had to know it was gonna happen with someone sooner or later. Well, maybe. But, you know, it's not something I wanted to think about. But you didn't love me. Not really love me. How do you know that? Zack, I have been your partner, your lover and your friend, but... I've never been the one. - Celeste, come on, that's not... - No, let's not kid ourselves. Either you never loved me or you couldn't show it. But whatever the case, it doesn't matter anymore. Hey, come in. Anton Pamchenko was my mom's coach. He discovered my father, turned him into a figure skater, and he paired him up with my mom. These are drawings of a move that he invented that won my parents the gold medaI. - It was only done this one time. Which is a good thing, because the Pamchenko is insanely dangerous. If one partner's so much as half a beat off, we'll both eat it. And we're not just talking career-ending, we're talking possibly life-threatening. I understand that you have to be desperate or insane to try this, Zack. Okay, so then, why are you showing us this? You guys nearly pulled off a miracle in Miami, but you crashed. Alex, to win in Paris, you have to be flawless. And given your time together, I'm sorry, but it's virtually impossible. Or you two could do a move that no one else can do. And you could steaI the gold. It's too risky. Here, give me a minute. Zack. Come on, Zack. Talk to me. You know this is insane. I know. But I also know that that's why you came to me in the first place. I dare you to tell me otherwise. Come on, Zack. You managed to make an amazing skater out of Alex. And you're going to Paris. Why are you so worried about it being too dangerous? Oh, so you fell for her. At least have the guts to finish what you started. Okay. You... Put this on. I don't wanna explain to your mom how I brought you home with your head facing backwards. More speed, guys. More speed. Come on. Faster, faster, faster. Again! Higher. Higher on the bounce. You have got to get her up there, Zack! Okay, get up and do it again. Again. Again. Zack? Okay if I join you? You know, it's none of my business, but there's just so much I don't know about you. It's like we're from different planets. Yeah. I'm from the one with coaches and agents. You're from the one with people. You know, there's really a whole lot less to me than you think. Uh-huh. You know, you're never gonna convince me that your whole skater-playboy life is all bad. And, yeah, you lost a lot as a kid, and that sucks, but... We all get a little lonely, no matter how much company we have. It's all part of the life deaI. Look, you don't have to answer, okay? But what about Celeste? When she's skating again? Right now, you and I are partners. That's all that matters. Come here. You know, when we first started out, I was afraid you were gonna mess with me. And now I'm afraid you won't. Uh-oh! Oops! Okay. Awkward moment. - You want a taco? Yeah? Okay. - Yeah. We are live in Paris for the InternationaI Figure Skating Conference Championship. ROB.; Bright and Halyard. What a performance. Very, very strong. LORl.; Misha back together with her partner, Rudy. They're reunited, and this looks like a Russian revival. ROB.; It looks like Alexandra Delgado and Zack Conroy have picked up where they left off. No indication that the accident in Miami has slowed either of them down. LORl.; I couldn't agree with you more. They are skating a beautifuI short program. You have to admit, this is one impressive pair. Yeah! - How does that feeI? - It didn't suck. America's Sweethearts, everybody. America's Sweethearts. Zacko! Zack, Alex, I just wanted to say congratulations. Your skate out there today was really inspiring. - Thanks, Jason. - You're welcome. We just feeI so horrible about what happened. - What are you talking about? - You haven't seen the pictures? That's priceless. He doesn't know. He hasn't seen them. You see, Zack... This is you, and that... That's not Alex. Zack, what's going on? Hold on there, Casanova. There's more. Here's one where you're hugging her. Another here where her engagement ring is nicely featured. I'm sure Bryan would be really interested to see these photos, Zack. Oh, and this one's my personaI favorite. This is precious. - You're kissing her here, Zack. - You son of a bitch! Zack! Zack! Come on, Zack. Let's go. Now that you're back with Celeste, how will that impact your... Alex, hold on! Alex! Alex, wait! - And what about the romance between... - Shut the camera off. Shut the camera off! - Just answer the question. Alex! Alex! - What about the romance between you... - Get out of my face! Alex. Zack. I really shouldn't be telling you this, but you look so pathetic sitting here all night. I know something maybe you should know. Yeah. Hey, Jackie. So, do you want the good news, the bad news or the worst? Between all the shoving and confusion yesterday, no one seems sure who started it, so that's the good. - How is she? - I'm getting to that. Now, if Jason Bright swears a formaI complaint, they'll have to disqualify you. That's the bad. No one's getting disqualified, Jackie. Jason will never make it stick. Will she at least talk to me? That's the worst. Alex is leaving. Okay. Go to the arena, make sure that we are still on the program. If anyone asks you, we'll be there. BOBBY.; Don't even try, man. I warned you. You know what? You're right. I'm a jerk. I'm not trustworthy. You never should've let me near her. All those are true if you take those photos at face value. You're an intelligent man, Bobby. You know that pictures and people are not always what they seem. Oh, yeah? What about the bimbo in this room, huh? - She saw that? - Yeah. That's just great. I'm going to meet someone. Give Alex this note, make sure she reads it, please! I'll be waiting at the rink. Hey. Thanks for meeting me. It wasn't easy after yesterday. It was so hard getting away from the press. There's something you should hear. - It's not gonna be pleasant. - Okay. There you go. It's okay. You can tell her. Zack wants me to tell you about those photographs. How I know that they come from Bryan. He was having you followed. And... And how do you know this? He told me. In bed. I want you to know it didn't mean anything. You know, Bryan and me, we're old friends. You know how that is sometimes. No, I don't. - I tried. - Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry, but I thought you should know. You gonna be okay? You forget who you're talking to. I've been practicing landing on my feet all my life. So what are you gonna do? Honestly, I just want Alex to skate. Not for me, for her. She deserves it. Well, I should go. Bryan is expecting me. You know, Zack, you should tell Alex. Just like you told me. Taxi! Yeah? Good. Okay. Well, we've said it before, we say it again, Bright and Halyard look unbeatable. Thank you. You said you'd rather be alone My whole world turned to stone But in another world If you come crashing back to me Then we will know such love That was never meant to be - Bobby, what is this? - Just talk to him. No! Take me to the airport! Alexandra, you're a very determined person, and that will help you accomplish a lot of things. But to throw away the greatest opportunity of your life because you're stubborn? That... That accomplishes nothing. You said you'd rather be alone I read your stupid note, and I listened to all your messages about the pictures and the girI in the hallway. - Are you satisfied? - Not really, but it's a start. When you asked me about Celeste, I wasn't sure. Not about my future with her, but about you. Don't start that with me. When I saw you walk out of my life yesterday, that hurt worse than anything I've ever felt. I don't understand, Zack. What do you want? I want you, Alex, in my life. Hey, you guys are both athletes, right? Which means you can walk and talk at the same time. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on. - Zack Conroy. - Alexandra Delgado. Come on. Hurry. - I got it, I got it. Hurry, hurry. Let's go. Come on! And the competition is really heating up here at the InternationaI Figure Skating Conference Championships in Paris. And, of course, everyone waiting to see Zack Conroy and Alexandra Delgado. They're currently sitting in second place after the short program. We did it. We did it. Yes! You have two minutes for your skaters to take the ice. Thank you. Yeah! We did it! Oh, look at this. Big marks for Bright and Halyard. Yes! Come on. Sweetheart, you're late, baby. We nailed it. I think Celeste Mercier just announced her disengagement. - Alexandra Delgado and Zack Conroy... - Jackie. ...are really going to have to skate a perfect program, a flawless program, if there is going to be... They're coming, they're coming! They're just putting on their skates. They'll be right here. - They have less than two minutes. - Yeah. Alex, wait. - We're late! - I don't care about that. First, I wanna be sure that you heard what I said outside. You know that's not fair. It's too much. Okay. Let me try to make this simple. I love you, Alex. I love you. And I'm still waiting on you to answer the first question I ever asked you. Will you skate with me? He said, "Take the ice. " We're gonna do it. - Do what? - You know. The move. The Pamchenko? - No. - Yes. Well, it looks like they made it. Alexandra Delgado and Zack Conroy are taking to the ice right now. How hard will this be? They did not warm up. No one has seen this team. They begin the night in second place after the short program, and they have their work cut out for them. - No. You could get hurt. - I didn't come all this way to punk out. Remember how I said I didn't break so easily? I wasn't kidding. - What does that mean? - I'll translate later. She's like the wind through my tree She's rides the night next to me She leads me through moonlight Only to burn me with the sun She's taken my heart But she doesn't know What she's done Feel her breath on my face Her body close to me Can't look in her eyes She's out of my league Just a fool to believe I have anything she needs They have been flawless so far. This is where they need the extra marks. And there are rumors of another new move. I look in the mirror and all I see You ready? Like I've been rehearsing this moment my entire life. With only a dream ROB.; And they've done it! And it's the Pamchenko, of all moves. And we've only ever seen it once before, that bounce spin to a throw twist. ROB.; And that will do it. That will win them the gold medal. - They did it! They did it! - LORl.; What an incredible finish to tonight's competition. The answer is yes, I'll skate with you, always. If you want it If you want my lovin', baby Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Call me, please, babe My head is spinnin'around Just like I'm fallin'in When I think of you When I think of you It took me by surprise When you looked in my eyes That's all you had to do I'm waiting so patiently For you to notice me Step out beyond my dreams And become a reality Yeah If you want my lovin', baby Come to me, baby You will finally see How it's gonna be If you want my lovin' easy Boy, you better please me And you will finally see How it's gonna be with me
