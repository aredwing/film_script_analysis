Yeah. What'd you tell her? The truth. Shit! Ree! Just kidding. You're not gonna believe what happened... my phone died. It jumped right out of the canoe into the lake, and Tommy tried... Okay. Good night, my little boobaloo. Good night, my little sugar booger. Thanks, Ree. Did you have fun? Yeah. Then what's wrong? He's here now, and I just want to cuddle up. Well, can't you tell him to go home? Yes. Y'all having a slumber party in here! Tommy, I am tucking my daughter in. Can I watch? That is so wrong! Tommy, this is Lauduree. She's gonna save the world someday. Hi. Hi. Oh, you're waiting for me, Aren't you, sweetie? Okay, I'll just be one minute. Okay, rooster. Did you water your plants? Did you water your trees? Uh-huh. Do you forgive me? Okay, guys. Here is your extra credit question, and you have 15 minutes to answer. Why... Does science matter? For makin' babies! Actually, Alex, that's an excellent answer. And if you guys can answer that using science, you will get 25 extra points, which you guys need, 'cause your test scores are dismal. So, not a great way to start the year, guys, okay? See you guys writing... already. Good. "Science says that everything around us "has an invisible reason for existing: "The sky... "Electricity... "Chlorophyll... "The color of someone's irises. "Science brings me closer to the world. "Science is also the only way we're going to figure out "how to make our planet safe for future generations. "Solutions for global warming "must be researched now. We're at the tipping point." "Dear Lauduree... "I went to California to follow my dream "of becoming a makeup artist for the stars. "I left you $50 for food and other things. "I want you to call grandma. "This is not goodbye forever. Love, Mom." Hey, hon. Just stopping by to say hi. Hi. Your mom wanted me to check on you on my way to work. Wait a minute, my phone. Hey. I-I can't hear you, the reception's bad out here. Hang on. Are you okay? Yeah, I have a test tomorrow. Well, if your mom forgets to come home tonight, you call me. She's doing 'mary kay.' I know what she's doing, hon. Have her call me. Consider that my rain dance for the day. As the heat wave continues, we'll try to keep you cool here at WUXI. Mom. Pretty pro, huh? Boo! La la la la! Stupid asshole piece of shit! Screw you! Fuck you! Oh. Hi. I didn't see you sitting there. My name is Neel. I just moved here. Lauduree's very pretty. Where'd it come from? My mom made it up. She was obsessed with french things. Is she not alive anymore? No. What are you reading? An article that says that the buildup of carbon dioxide is killing off coral. It's poisoning their food source, so they're spitting out their own tissue and starving to death. It's why they're turning white. Are you going to the Science Club meeting tomorrow? I'm trying to read. Ms. Markovi's really cool. I think she's Macedonian. I'll save you a seat. Hey, it's Tanya and Ree. Leave us a message after the beep. Hey, girls, it's Gigi. I'm inviting y'all for dinner tomorrow. Ed, his daughters, and the grandkids are making a special trip down from Owensboro. I got really good news. Okay, call me. Bye. Hey. Yeah, I just gotta go get something from my locker. Hey, how's it goin', buddy? How's my little science nerd doing today? Huh? Huh? You like my armpits, creep? - They stinky? They stinky? - Oh, nice! From gym class! Look me in the eye! Look me in the eye, butt wad! - It's trash girl! - Trash girl! It's trash girl. Is she gonna save us? - She can't do it...! - Leave him alone. Gettin' your girlfriend to fight your battles. I'll kick your balls, piss ant. Did she just say piss ant? Let's go. Let's leave this loser for someone else to take care of, huh? Do you need me to call a teacher? So... welcome to Science Club. We have two brave souls. You like raisins? You? Good. And we will get started. Biodiversity. You know what that is, right, guys? The number of plant and animal species in the ecosystem. Right. What's the plainest language we can put that in? Life. Yeah. Biodiversity. What else do we know about biodiversity? - It's being threatened by global warming. - Yep. Mm-hmm. - What are some other threats? Neel? - Polution. - Deforestation. - Mm-hmm. And the list could go on. So most scientists agree that the rate of species loss is greater than it's ever been in human history. I mean, this is a big deal. This is something that scientists should be talking about more, right? And we're not. So my challenge to you as young scientists is, how do you guys propose we get the data out of the laboratory and into the community? By telling people? Mm-hmm. Yeah. We need to tell people. But more than that, we need to involve people, 'cause that's where stuff starts to happen. So what I thought we would do is something called community interventions, - where we take these field trips... - I... I started... a science project in the spring already. I didn't know we were gonna do a group one. Oh! well... tell us about it. Well, my hypothesis is that in our region, the loblolly pine affixes more carbon dioxide yearly than the red oak. Great. So you're trying to use photosynthesis To pull CO2 out of the atmosphere. - It's a great premise. - Yeah. Whichever species uses the most CO2 could be planted as forests in our region to reverse the effects of global warming. This is something scientists are talking a lot about right now. However, from what I've read about carbon sinks, which is what you're trying to create, more forests can actually raise temps. I haven't been looking at temperature change because the trees are too small. What you're proposing is extremely complicated. I mean, there is a lot of variables. It's very tricky to model, even for scientists, especially with climate patterns becoming so unpredictable. Lauduree. I-I thought your mom was picking you up. I forgot, she has to work on thursdays. Well, get into the car. I'll take you home. Come on. We can change the meeting night. I can call your mom. - I decided I'm not doing science club this year. - Why? I've spent too much time with my tree data. I'm not giving up now. I mean, we're gonna learn a lot about conservation issues. I know you're interested in that from your extra credit. Neel's really smart. I think you guys would make a great team. I don't work with partners. Who wants a burger? Huh? Greta, honey? You coming back? Hey, you've reached my voicemail. I'm waiting for your secret message. Well, here's my secret message: Ed and I are moving. I'll send you a postcard. Same time next week? You like it in the ground. I'd sleep out here with you tonight, but I can't risk a tick bite. Can you believe how good she looks? Do you sell light bulbs? Right there. You want one? Nah, it's okay. Total is $19.72. I think these have expired, hon. Hold on. Let me talk to the manager a second. Will you give me a ride? Sure. Hey! Ernesto! Hey! Did you get any I.D.? - Whoo! - Hot damn! That was like fate that I was there! Yeah, that was awesome. Thanks for the ride. Sure. I won't tell your mom, but... Is she here? No. Listen, honey, they're not gonna press charges, okay? But the deal is, I need to speak to a guardian. What about your dad? I don't have one. All right, I guess you'd better get started on your homework, then. If your mom's not back in an hour, I'm gonna have to take you down to the jail. I need to file a report. You got somebody you wanna call? No. So why are these things so expensive? They last longer? Looks like you're in luck. What happened? - You Mrs. Cready? - Yes. Well, we picked up your daughter for shoplifting. - Tanya! - There's not gonna be any charges... but, you know, you may wanna keep an eye on her. And next time I see you, you'd better be giving your valedictorian speech. Valedictorian?! She's a terrible thief. What's going on? I shoplifted. I can see that. Why were you shoplifting, and more importantly, where is your mother? Do you know that Roy called me, and the goddamn rent check is late again. The district manager requested her for a bachelorette party. They... they liked her best. - How'd you get to the store? - I walked. You walked two goddamn miles to shoplift a light bulb? I like walking. Where's your vanity? Huh? Where is it? Mom loaned it to Juanita for the miss apple pageant. Where... where's the TV? It broke. No, you shouldn't go back there. - Why? - Something really bad happened. - Roy was supposed to... - Oh, really? - What happened, huh? What? - It was really bad. You better tell me what's going on, Lauduree, or I'm gonna find it out for myself! She moved. She what? She moved to California! I'll see you in hell, Tanya. I haven't seen Mr. banana in years. Want me to lay with you till you fall asleep? You must be feeling pretty crummy. I'm here if you want to talk about it. Right. What were you planning doing out here all by yourself? Living. Aren't you afraid it'd get lonesome? You live alone. I have, for a long time. I don't want to leave my home. I don't blame you, hon. Let's not talk about it tonight. We're wiped out. Let's get some rest. We'll talk about it in the morning, okay? No, it's not. It's based on evidence. Hey, Ree, you up? Yeah, I'm just working on a report. - Well, what time's your bus? - No, there's no more debate. Just follow the hot spots. - Listen to me. Spring is happening... - Ree! Hon, you're talkin' in your sleep. What time is it? It's 6:45. Let's go. I don't like to lollygag, so I'm gonna spend the day doing stuff around here. Like what? Well, I gotta pack up everything to move it to my house. - Now, I talked to Roy, and he said... - When did you talk to Roy? Well, earlier this morning. - Did he call? - I called him. Thought you said we would talk about it in the morning. Lauduree, there is nothing to talk about. You are 13 years old. You cannot live here on your own. That is it. Why? Well, for one thing, the criminal life doesn't seem to be working out so well for you. I told you, I'm working as a tutor to pay the rent. - What is it? You don't like me? - I like you. Then what is so bad about coming to live with me? I can't leave my research. Lauduree, you are not a scientist. You are a minor without a mother. I am in the middle of finding out That fix a greater proportion of CO2 in the atmosphere than oaks. If you make me leave now, I'll have to abandon six months' of data. Lauduree, look, I know that you are an extremely self-sufficient girl, but even if I could abide you living out here on your own, the state would come in, and they would take you away and place you in a foster home. Now, is that what you want? Huh? And anyway, I am not gonna be around here to bail you out. Ed and I are movin'. - What? - Yeah. To Florida, just as soon as the house sells. I'm not going. Well, you can take those trees with you. No, I can't, because pinus taeda will not survive in a tropical climate. And guess what? We're running out of time! Well, you really don't have any choice in the matter, do you? Do you realize the situation your mother's placed us in? You had a piece of hair sticking up. It looked cool. How do you know they'll survive? I think they'll do just fine. Can't promise, though, can you? No, Ree, I can't, because there are all sorts of things in this world that are beyond my control. Like what? Like a fungus. Or you could mow them over like you did mom's stargazers. That was a mistake for christ's sake. Just tie a ribbon around them, they'll be just fine. Not if you've tied 'em on. I'm gonna get ya! Hey, you want me to make you a scar? - Nah. - Yeah? Come on! Don't be such a fuddy-duddy. I'm not. I just don't like looking weird. Well, I'll make you look pretty, then. I don't want to look pretty, either. - What do you want to look like, then? - Mom. - Mom. - Hmm-hmm? Mom, look what I found. Pretty. Will you take my picture? Sure. Where'd you get this? Tommy. I gotta get my portfolio together. Tout de suite, cherie. This is the big time. Mew. Another. I wasn't ready. Okay. Okay. Cheese! Hey. I'm gonna smoke a cigarette. Why don't you go on in and say goodbye? I'm just saying, don't bug me about that. Don't... I'm sorry. I'm not mad. No... I'll call in to work. No, what are they gonna say? Yeah. I know. I'll call you back. Bye. Thanks, Ed. It's, um... It's really big. You're welcome. So what's this I hear about your mom driving to California? She wants to be a makeup artist. Well, I just want to say, Ree, how sorry I am. She's not dead. What'd she say? She didn't die, Ed. That's awful, Ree. I would never say something like that. Hon, you want to start up the grill? Sure. Oh... I got you this too. Thought you might like it. Everybody's doing the best that they can, and you'd better rise to the occasion, hon. Real page-turner, huh? What's happening now, Ree? They're lost. Everyone back at base camp thinks they've either died of hypothermia or eaten each other. Ooh. Now, you want to do something like that? Work at a weather station under perilous conditions? It's just a story. Well, sure, but... I mean, people really do do stuff like that, you know? You could definitely get that kind of training in Florida. And it's a lot warmer than the Himalayas. Anyplace is warmer than the Himalayas, Ed. The Himalayan glaciers are actually melting faster than any glacier in the world, and over a billion people depend on them for water. - A billion. - Hmm. Your grandma hates the cold, don't you, hon? I live through it. Every year, Ed. Ree, did you know that the Kennedy Space Center is in Florida, and they have got every kind of research facility that you can think of. As a matter of fact, right next door to my condo is the school for meteorology, Which is global warming, Right? Weather patterns. I'm more interested in wilderness preservation. Florida is a wilderness paradise. Ree... One of the sharpest kids that I have ever met. - What do you want to do? - You just asked her that, Ed. Well, no, Greta, I did not. Whatever it is that you are after, you need to promise yourself, make a promise to yourself that you will try to get there. In case you haven't noticed, Ed, we are not in the mood for one of your motivational speeches because we are sucking lemons. 'Course, if we were Himalayan, we'd be making lemonade, and we'd be grateful. What do you think, Ree? I think Florida's gonna be underwater in 30 years, Ed. Yeah, that book?! That book now?! Yeah, well, I thought the book would be a good idea. Just lookit. She's interested. - Death and Mayhem. - I know, I know! What do you wanna do? There's so much tension in this house. I know. You're smoking again! I don't even want to know what kind of a wreck you would be if you had to look after little Caleb and Courtney all by yourself. I suppose I would have called the police. Right! Because if Mandy or Tina disappeared, that would mean that they had been kidnaped. Mine, on the other, disappeared her own goddamn self! She ran away, Greta! Ed, she's a 30-year-old woman, she's not a runaway. So I guess looking for her is out of the question. I didn't say that. Well, Lauduree certainly wasn't warm to the idea of moving to Florida. Well... maybe it's better if she just stays put. What, so she can get knocked up her junior year? Ed, I'm just talking till the end of the school year. You could move in here. My mom's coming back. Whatever floats your boat. ...Weather will spell economic disaster for many local farmers, as extreme draught continues to plague the tri-state area. Mustard or mayo? Dry. ...Temperatures in the upper 90s. That the prices of corn and soy could soar. How 'bout plants? Very good. Local plant or flower? I'm ready to help. Awesome. We're just getting ready to do interviews. Let's go. Grab your backpack. Okay. Hi, I'm a member of the Central School Science Club. Would you have a minute to tell us about your favorite local animal or insect? I always loved butterflies, the yellow kind that look like tissue. Oh, and of course, cicadas. There's someone, Lauduree. Go for it. We're talking to people in the community - about how environmental disruption... - Sorry. I love horses. I love horses. It's a passion of mine. I love to ride, and, you know, I used to ride, like, english, western, you know, and then I went into bareback. I like snapping turtles. I remember him showing me this beautiful, snowy-white egret, and... but, you know, you don't see them around here anymore. You know, I haven't seen any in... 14 years. They used to come around every summer. I used to be able to catch lake sturgeon this big across't. I haven't caught any like that in 20 years. What are you laughing at? Pigtoes! All right, so... a pigtoe looks like, um... looks like the... Pleurobema Serlus. Let me see. "Habitats include streams and creeks in and around Jackson County Nature Preserve." That's right by my house. "They ingest algae, bacteria, and other detritus in the water." They're natural filters. They keep the water clean. It says here that they're in danger. Maybe we've found the hero to our food web, guys. They're primary consumers. Their ecosystem is fragile. Their habitat is endangered. Endangered doesn't mean they're past the point of no return, right? No. Some mussels species have lived over a hundred years. If you find one in this draught, you have a chance at restoration. Save the pigtoe! Why not? Hey, where did you buy this lovely...? They were on sale at J.C. Penney! Oh, he's taking advice from strangers! I can't believe you bought this for me! You should have seen the girl! What did you say? I said, "Oh, she's about this big, and..." "and she's..." well... just... I think they thought it was for me! Wait a minute. I am going to go over to meet the boys at the VFW. Would you like to buy a vowel? - Oh. Hi, hon! - What? Hey! Hey... She's a beauty, ain't she? Darling, would you like to join us on the veranda? Come on, Ree, come on! Come on out! Smells like a skunk. Honey, stay out here and celebrate with us. I got an offer on the house today. I have homework. Lauduree? Hi. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm... it's just allergies. Global warming's increasing pollen count. - What have you got there? - It's my oak. I'm staying with my grandma 'cause my mom's out of town, so I had to move it. The experiment's dead. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you need someplace to plant it? I guess we were thirsty. Yeah, I guess so. The mint's from my garden. I can give you a bunch to take home. Also, I thought you could use this. Sometimes it helps to have a camera in the field. It's just a point-and-shoot. Hey, if there's anything you want from your mom's room, take it, 'cause the rest, goin' to Goodwill. Ms. Markovi... says that if Science Club goes well next year, she's taking a group of us to Guatemala to do a community outreach program there. Is Miss Markovi paying for this? Miz. I don't know. Well, why don't you ask Miz Markovi about that before she goes booking trips to other countries. Why don't you have a carwash? I'd pay a buck for a good carwash. Carwashes poison rivers and everything that inhabits them. Well, lucky for you, you're gonna be in Florida. Aren't you going to eat your broccoli? - You're a crank. - Hmm? Nothing. I-I thought you said that you wanted to be a vegetarian! No. I said... that confined animal feeding operations are the largest cause of greenhouse gases, and that we should only buy from small local farms. I swear, you have selective hearing. Do not talk to me that way, Lauduree! I'm really tired of this "miss know-it-all attitude." Now, if you're gonna be living in this house... I didn't ask to live here! You're right. Where are you going? It's none of your business. Shot of maker's. Hey, you seen a girl named Tanya in here lately? She's about this tall, blonde hair, blue eyes, real cute figure. Crystal's friend. That's the one. Nah, I ain't seen here in a while. Crystal was in here the other night, though. She was showing me pictures of her chihuahua. Lucky you. Them things are freaky. Hello? Hi, is Neel home? This is Neel. Is this Lauduree? - Yes. - Hi. Do you want to find some pigtoes tomorrow? Let's get started, baby! - Hey, Crystal! - Whoo! Hey! I need to talk to you. Oh, hey, Greta, I'm workin'. You wanna come in for a drink? No, not really. Are you still working nights at the V.A.? Like a rat in a can. So you got a number where she's at. - Who? - Cut the crap, Crystal... 'Cause you know what I'm picturing right now? - I'm picturing her real high on crank. - Good lord! In a horse barn turned into a meth lab with the lowlife that you turned her on to. I'm gonna go back inside, baby. Cruiser! Look, Greta, I'm in the same boat you are. I haven't heard from her in two weeks, and I'm worried to death. I can tell when you're lying, Crystal, 'cause you are the one that taught Tanya how to do it. Oh, little ol' me, huh? I just wanna know if she's alive. Okay, I'm gonna level with you. Ree thinks she's dead. She won't eat. She won't sleep. She won't bathe. She quit goin' to school. I been thinkin' about goin' to a psychiatrist. Now, where am I gonna get that kind of money? Shit! Told her she should have just let me take her. She wrote me some dumbass letter. It broke her heart, Greta, honest to god, but you gotta try and be proud of her. She thinks she's doing something right in her life. You know how old I was when I had my first beer? You know where I was? Your basement. Hey, I know your daddy. There wasn't any shortage at your place. No pigtoes. No pigtoes here, either. Gotta find a spot with deeper water. Did you read that somewhere? No. But pigtoes need fish to reproduce. It was too shallow over there for fish to swim. You gotta get in. It's just water. - I found one. - Where? - Just kidding! - Hey! All right, stop, stop, stop. You're gonna make the water cloudy. Look! I found one! Really? Don't touch it! You need a permit. Oh. He's dug in there. That's it. I think I got it. There's no way you're catching up with me. Do you want to go in? No. Should we wait here till your mom gets back? My mom ran away. What do you mean? I mean she packed up her stuff and drove away. - I thought you said your mo... - I lied. I didn't want you to make a big deal about the whole thing. We moved here when I was 5. This was our first house together. Before that, we lived at my grandma's. Is that where you live now? What about your dad? He was a business student at Rend Lake. He was killed in a motorcycle crash when I was 2. I never met him. Will you take my picture? Jesus! Ree! You scared me. Lauduree. Lauduree. Honey. Come on, you gotta wake up. You fell asleep in the kitchen. For Pete's sake. Fine. I don't care. What you drinkin'? A beer. How come? Well, 'cause I like it. What are you doing up past your bedtime? You said I could. I don't recall that. You said it was a new first date rule. Lauduree, I don't know what you're talking about. Mom. Remember that guy you dated when I was 9? He was bald and had a ponytail? Good french inhale. Jim Polecock. Yeah, that's right. He called Crystal Betty Grable, - and you Gene Tierney. - I didn't know that. Yeah, 'cause you were both beautiful. But Crystal was an airhead, and you were tragic. God, if he only knew. And he called Gigi Bette. Bette for... - Bette Davis? - Yeah. Huh. Hey, do you remember the nursing home? Yeah. They kicked you out, though, 'cause you made all the old ladies look like movie stars. God, they loved her there. That was a great job, and you know, I got her that job. She was at her best then. Think you'll ever get married? No. Why? 'Cause I stay up late, and they get up early. Well, that's sorta dumb. Yeah, well... I don't trust men. Why not? I met a bad one once. He kind of ruined the rest. All right, come on. Gotta get you up to bed. It's okay. It's grandma. It's Gigi. - Gigi? - Yeah. Is mom here? No, honey. I... I was just talking to her. Where'd she go? It's just me. It's all right. Come on. We came down here in the kitchen, we had a nice little talk. Your momma used to sleepwalk. I used to find her all around this house. It's all right, honey. You know, it's gonna be okay. We just gotta tough it out. What if we never see her again? I want her to come back. Hello? Hello? Hey hey! What's the banana, popsicle? I can't do it, Ed. Darling, I'm on the green here with lamb and the doc. Can I call you back this evenin'? I can't uproot her again... and I am through with this long-distance stuff, - so we're breaking up. - Can I call you tonight? - No, I'm working tonight. - Call me when you get off. - You'll be sleeping. - I'll wake up! You always say that, Ed, and you never do it. I will this time! Listen, I am trying to find a time when I can give you my... I am breaking up with you! - Made coffee. - Wonderful. Want some eggs? Hon, I don't have my stomach yet. I called the realtor, turned down the offer on the house. We're not moving to Florida. Is Ed moving in with us? I'm sick of Ed. Thought everything was going good. Same as it's always been. Do you know that we had to go in front of the 'Queens of Owensboro' to get a blessing for this move? Who are the Queens of Owensboro? Ed's daughters. They practically disowned him when he even thought of buying me an engagement ring. He is spineless. That sucks. Yeah, it does. It sucks. But it was my own goddamn fault for thinking that this was gonna work out. There's a reason we've been long-distance for 10 years. But you know what? You make your bed. Your mom, when she was pregnant, she begged me to have an abortion, and I said over my dead body because I thought a child would teach her how to take care of herself. What a joke! She blows town, leaves you with me. Poetic justice. Isn't that what they call it? Isn't that what you get? Where are you going? Okay, I think it might be... I think I left it on... Lauduree. What are you doing here? How... how did you get in here? Neel and I found the crescent pigtoe. Laudur, how did you get into my house? What's wrong? This is my student, Lauduree. Lauduree, this is my husband, Paul. Hi. Maybe you could get us some water. Sure. You in trouble? We found the pigtoe in a stream near little grassy. Okay. That's great. It's not extinct, so we could breed it and reintroduce it to a bigger river. Lauduree. Florida was a lie. What do you mean? I mean my mom's not taking me there on vacation. She moved to California. Oh. - You know? - Your grandmother came to school. She's very worried about you. I can't stay with her. Did something happen? I thought I could live here for a while. You're the only one who gets what's going on in the world. I am not equipped to deal with this. Let me get you someone to talk to, okay? I don't need someone to talk to. I need a place to stay. You don't have any kids. No, actually, we're expecting a baby. You trying to get yourself killed? Your car's already doing the job, asshole! And your selfish, ignorant oil addiction! What are you lookin' at, huh? Are you ready for flooding the eastern seaboard? You ready for refugees camping out in your backyard? What do you think the future's gonna look like? Tropical paradise? Think it's gonna be nice and warm? Hell, there's not gonna be any food. Welcome to my future. This is part of our problem! Do you really need to buy a new plastic water bottle every day of your life? It's made from oil, the same stuff that gushed into the Gulf of Mexico, while we all just stood around. Lauduree. You are a hypocrite! Why would you want to bring a child into this world? It's cruel, and you know it. I was born with a mother and a father, and I don't know where they went. And that's how your kids are gonna feel when the shit hits the fan. Lauduree! It's time to come home. I'm not getting in that car. It's poison. You're poison. Hello? Hey. Is Greta there? One second. Um... she's in the bathtub. Can I take a message? She hasn't picked up for three days. You, uh... you okay? Yeah. Not going to do that anymore. I'm tired of being half here. I'm tired of putting my life on hold! # Time heals # Two thousand stomachaches # If I get bored # Every other day # Are we to have # Another century of guitar # When the best instrument # In the world # Is still... # Why are you wearing makeup? It's an experiment. What kind of experiment? To see whether people will treat me differently. Are they? You're the first person I've seen. Do you want people to treat you differently? That would be bias. I can't introduce bias into my experiment. Do you think I'm attractive? Yeah. Do you think you could like me forever? Probably. Then for the experiment, I need you to kiss me. Okay. I still have that feeling. Where is it? In my chest. What does it feel like? Tight and panicky. It's like I have no future. Everything's your future. Right this second is. Can I kiss you, to see if that has a result? Oh, my god! My baby! Come here! Ohh...! I came back for you, Ree! I came back for you! Shh. Shh. Let me look at you. You're a real lady now, aren't you? Feels like you've been gone for a year. Well, time moves slowly when you're little. I had to give up my project. We'll just... we'll start a new one just as soon as you get home, okay? It's too late. Ree, you're gonna be so proud of me. I've found us a place by the beach, in San Diego. With a patio for your plants. And it's real close to school, so you can walk without having to take the bus, just like you're always talking about. And there is nature everywhere in California. Sound good? Yeah? Okay. All right, will you just help me up now? Okay. Okay. Okay, we gotta hustle, though, okay? Will you... will you just close up that back right there? Just give it a real good shove. I was puttin' that TV in the back, and just as I was jumping out, I thought I shouldn't leave it loose like that. It'll roll all around, and I landed right on my ankle. Ohh! I just gotta think for a second. Maybe you should take a nap. A nap? Oh, god. We have to go, Ree! What am I gonna do? I killed it. Just until Missouri. Rooster! Rooster! Rooster! Are you ready for a whole new life, Ree? - Let's do it. - Okay. All right, you've got it in park. Now, let's turn that key. That's it! Now... put it in reverse. Yeah, just take your foot off the brake. - You got it, Ree! - Whoo-hoo! See ya, suckers! Wouldn't wanna be you! Au revoir! # I woke up # I was already me # I was somewhat afraid # I was something # Peace signs # I told you I could no longer see # I was right in the fire # I was on my knees # peace signs # Okay, I'll be just a minute. You be good. - What was that? - Oh, yeah, you know, it just started doing that, So I thought we could take it to, um, this friend of mine, just on the way out of town... - who fixes cars. - Mm-hmm. It probably just needs some oil. You know I'm an idiot when it comes to that kind of stuff. Oh, my god! So guess who's gonna help me pay for beauty school? Mom, I don't know if we should keep going. My dad! I met my dad! Thought no one knew where he was. He's got a whole new family. - Forgot his daughter, Ree! - Mom. Mom, I need you to focus. I need you to tell me what to do. Mom! You need to cut her, Ree. Brake. - I'm trying. - Well, turn off, turn off. Right here. Easy! Goddamn it! What am I supposed to do now? Call a tow truck. I can't afford a tow truck. What was the $300 for, then? To get back to California! Give me your phone. No, let's just wait for somebody to stop. Give me your phone. I know someone who can help us. I'm at the juncture of 29 and 70. Who was that? It's fine. You should stay off your foot. California is beautiful, Ree. You're gonna love it. There's palm trees everywhere. The beach is real close by. I'm gonna get a convertible. Custom-painted to match the sky. Why didn't you tell me about the truck? Because I wanted everything to be perfect when I came to get you. Let's go. Did you call her, Lauduree? Look, do not put this on her! - Get in the car! - Just stop ordering me around! I would love to leave you by the side of the road, Tanya. It's up to you. Just let me make a phone call. - I am not waiting. - Just wait! Jesus Christ! I swear to god, Tanya. There is something wrong with you. I don't know whether I should call the police department... or the psych unit! Well, there's no need to call anybody... 'cause I came to get my daughter! Well, what happened to you out there, anyway, huh? Did you lose all your cash? You down to your last plug nickel? Get outta the car, Lauduree. Give these to your Ma. Lauduree, maybe you can tell me why you were a half a mile away from the gold post pawn shop. Just tell her, mom. She's gonna find out, anyways. I found a diamond ring in an ashtray in the bathroom, and I sold it. Lauduree, go upstairs. Go upstairs! Ree, I love you. Jesus Christ, mom. Did you just think that was just, like, some bauble? From my bathroom? - What is...? - Stay out of my life! I did not ask you to come back here, did I? I did not ask to come back here! Well, then, why are you here? Because she called you! I told her not to. I said i didn't need you! I didn't want to be here! Somebody in the family has a brain. Do you know that every barfly in Jackson County wants to be a makeup artist, don't they? But they have something you don't, Tanya. See, you're just saying that because you hate me. I don't hate you! Tanya, you're just... missing something. I have tried for years to give it to you. I just don't know what to do anymore. The more you tell her that, the more she believes it. Okay, Ree, um, why don't you go up and pack up your stuff, 'cause we're gonna sleep at Crystal's tonight. I'm not going with you. What? I'm not going with you. Okay. Now, look, baby. It was a mistake to leave, okay? I know that you're mad at me. It was so, so, so selfish. But now I'm back, and we're gonna have a great time and be really, really happy together. I can't make you happy, 'cause it makes me a nothing, it makes me a blank. I'm your mom. Why would i make you a... a blank? What is a blank? I have no idea. Can I go to the library? Sure. We're gonna be at the pawn shop. I'm not giving up. I'm gonna be right here when you get back, Ree. Okay. - Now give me a kiss. - Okay. - I love you. - Love you too. I was about two minutes away from calling the cops. I'm sorry. Your mom went out with Crystal. She said she'd be back to tuck you in. Believe it when you see it. What happened? I stood by you. What'd she say? I told her I would take her to court, if need be. You know, I had a feeling that she was gonna look up that goddamn, no-good son of a bitch. Well... Maybe it'll do her some good. Who knows? Why are you laughing? I would have paid cash money to have seen her dad's face. When he opened up the door, there she was. That man was so stingy that if he'd give you a cigarette and you didn't smoke it right down to the filter, he'd go pick it out of the ashtray and suck on it, and suck it like he was suckin' lemons! Well, maybe he's learned a little bit since then. Gigi... Mmm? I want to move to Florida. You can't expect things from people, Lauduree. Ed loves you. Okay, we're walking in a line. Good, keep holding hands. Oh, we have to share the sidewalk. Let's let this lady through. Good job. # Oh, where did you go # When the snow fell that year? # Those from the camera I gave you? # These wooden walls like a bear # These look really great. - Thanks. - Great map. This... this is the pigtoe that Neel and I found, right around here. What are you having? A girl. What are you gonna name her? June. Do you have any other photos? Yeah. I have... - This one's a cicada shell... - Yeah. That I found right by my house. - That's a great one. - Oh, thanks. And that was near it? - Pine needles? - Mm-hmm. I like science because it helps you measure changes. Changes so small... they're barely visible to the naked eye. Ree! All right, all right, I'm coming, I'm coming. Hold on. Whoo! Let's go! Holdin' up the show, girl! # Good night, darling # Good night # I hope # You sleep well # Good night, darling # Good night # I wish # I could be there # Hear you breathing # And watch # Your chest # Rise and fall # Wrap around you # You are # The same length # As me # I was young when # I first # Heard about # Something called love # Someone told me # It was # Like finally waking up # 'course I laughed then # But now # You could say # I believe # If I were smarter # I'm sure # I'd write you # A symphony # I barely know you # But I feel I've # Loved you before # And I want to show you # This loose board # In the floor # This is where I # Keep my heart # Yes, this is # Where I # Keep my heart # Not on my sleeve # Nothing's certain # I know # But I like # To believe # Something out there # Somewhere # Intends us # To be # I'll keep standing # Right here # Just as proud # As april pie # Your eyes are colored # In shades # Of copper and malachite # This song # Is simple # But it's the best # I can do # 'cause it ain't so simple # To capture # The way I feel # But I thought I'd try # Yes, I thought I'd try # Good night, darling # Good night, darling # Good night, darling # Good # Night # Sleep well #
