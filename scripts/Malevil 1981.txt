Momo! Hush! Come on, what's going on? It's saturday! Not saturday! Yes, it's saturday! Do you want some help? Come on! Not saturday! Not saturday! Here we go. The hardest is done. Now take off your pullover and trousers. Listen Momo. You're 32 years old, When you're 32, you can wash yourself! Do you understand that? - All the bottles are clean? - Yes almost! I don't think it'll be today. - Tomorrow? - No. And the sow? I'll go. Germain, can you bring me a lamp? I've got one in the bag. "Pervenche" is still the most beautiful. You should the wall back up here. A maternity ward must be clean. I'm going to put my wine in bottles. If you want to come and taste it... More news at eleven. - Hello, Mr Mayor. - Hello. - If you're thirsty... - With pleasure. These stamps come from far away. - Are you collecting them? - Not me, but my son. - I'll keep them then. - Thank you. Hello. Did I disturb you? Even the chemist? It's a delegation. Not at all. These gentlemen dragged me here. So? We asked Mr Bouvreuil to come, so you can make an agreement together. - Do you want to go in the kitchen? - No, no... I've got nothing against this project, but look... They want to put a streetlight right here. Near my bedroom window. We could move it a bit, no? We modified this blueprint 17 times, so we can move on. But I remind you... That we can't move the streetlight to the left because on the left there's the cross from your drugstore and on the right there's "Doctor Bouvreuil street". You don't want us to put the light in the middle of your father's street. Don't expect my vote on this. That's not possible. You know we need your vote for this project. I've got a solution. If your shop's cross was under your bedroom window would you be inconvenienced? No, because I turn it off when I close the shop. Perfect, so we put the light instead of the cross and you put the cross under your window. Who'll pay for that? The council. Except if you're against it. - Someone has to pay anyway. - Anyway. Is it solved? Would you mind writing down this change. - Do you want to taste my wine? - Thank you. Where are the glasses? Australia? Do I dare ask you for the stamps? I already promised them. - Will your son come back for a bit? - In autumn. He says hello! - Mr Mayor... - Cheers! Another power failure. Wait...I've got a lighter. Strange, there's nothing. The batteries are good. I'll go. It's dangerous. It's dangerous. It's dangerous. It's dangerous. Wait! Dog. "Tempest". Dog. "Tempest". "Tempest". Dog. "Tempest". Momo! But what did you see? Wait for me! That's the only thing left. Momo! Momo, come! Yes. Momo, yes! Maybe we could start to talk again. I'll go get some wood. It's not good to let the dead stink. It's wrong. - It's dangerous. - No, move! It's dangerous. On the right! Straight on! Straight on! On the left! I thought it would be worse. You shouldn't do this. If you fell we'd have no horse. I had to do this. If it was you, you'd have done it. You left him to die outside, like a dog. What has he eaten since he left? What does he drink? He'd come back if he didn't find anything. Anyway, leave my horse alone. My horse, your horse, his horse. Are you crazy? It's hard to be understood. I meant the opposite. Everything here doesn't belong to me anymore. The "Periwinkle" belongs to us all. You can't leave with her without telling us. - Those are just words! - No. Come on. I wasn't thirsty like this before. Have you seen the mark on Colin's shoulder? No. I was like you; I had a family. Do you think it's right not to talk about the others? Yes, it's better. Did you see something? A horse is passing? Emanuel. I think it's too late. Someone took the mare. Damn! And there's a pig missing. A small one? Not the Big one, of course. Look, the mare passed through here. - More? - I'm thirsty. Evelyne? - Evelyne. - No. Momo! Leave him! Momo! Come, Momo! Come! Come! The river didn't run there. Sure not! Who knows where it goes. - Who's that? - Don't you recognise her? - Was she alone? - Yes. Evelyne, where were you when it happened? In the cave. What did you see? A flash of light. Then? Then lightning struck somewhere. Since then, I can't see. - Will they come? - Who? The others. My mother went with them, Momo didn't find her. We'll have to wait to find out. Do you think we'll know, one day? Why not? If we're not the only survivors. Did someone heard the news? The morning before the... Yes. They didn't say a thing. We'll probably... have some news soon. Meanwhile, someone has to decide. There'll be nothing left to eat soon. Why does she say that? You're right, we can't share our food like this indefinitely... You were the Mayor, so you can still be. Yes, very good. - I've got enough. - Talk! A mandate should have a limited time so... Let's say, Emanuel is Malevil's Mayor until we get some news. I'm fully satisfied. Fully. All the better. Come on, go to bed! Don't stay here, you! Are you not worried about that mark? What mark? On your shoulder; it seems to be getting bigger. He's had it since birth. His poor mother had the same. Come on! You'll not touch? And think about washing yourselves tomorrow. What's she saying? - She says we stink. - She's right. You didn't know him. It was Meneau's husband. I'll go sleep outside. What are we doing about the fire? If a plane passes by? He's right. Put some wood on the fire! Did you hear? Evelyne. Come see! Come see! Here! They came back. My child... My child, try to remember. On that day, when the lightning struck did it burn your eyes or did you feel nothing? I don't know. - You don't remember anything? - No. Open your mouth. It's "Bouvreuil" syrup. What are you giving her? Dipotassic Clorazepate. It smells like gas. Don't you see anything? Something shiny other there. And now? The same. - Did you like Eric? - Yes. I'm his father, you know. I didn't know. You played with him often in the cave. Not only with him. When the lightning struck, were you alone? Yes. He couldn't come, he was grounded. But where is he, Eric? I don't know. - You don't like it? - I don't know if the soil is still good. We'll try anyway. What if the sun doesn't come back? We must keep trying. I found this for you. Emanuel's son? Did you know him? Yes, of course. He left no more than 5 years ago. His mother took him with her. Over there. If he knew his father were alive, he'd find a way to return. He's a radio nut too. We used to build radio sets together. I was ten. It must be a boy! When will this little vale be able to mate with his mother? In a year. - Till then... - Until then... What? Or they find us, or we'll be... We have enough for 2 months. If we don't eat much. And after those 2 months? Or it rains and the water is good, or it's rotten and we are too. It's a male. Well done. We're lucky! Listen Bouvreuil, you don't have to stay. Where do you want me to go? If you stay... Do like us, Wait for the rain, take a shovel... and shut up. The vale. The vale. The vale. Evelyne. Don't stay. Again. Evelyne. Take. France welcomes Monarch from Sweden. Come see. Look. - Who did this? - It's Colin! Anyways your machine... That's not a good reason to break everything. You don't need it anymore. It's not the machine's fault. Oh, no. Everything's been pulled out. Is that a transmitter, you're making? I'm trying. Maybe he'll hear us over there. In Australia. I don't think so, he doesn't enjoy it anymore. - He told you? - He wrote it. How will you make it work? With the generator. You got gas. Some are lucky. Six. Can you give me tokens? You're stealing 10 francs. - You're not playing anymore? - Oh no. It's crazy how fast we lose money here. I want to tell you something. Colin decided, by himself, to make a transmitter. It may be good, it may be bad... When we use this transmitter it'll burn gas We have in all, 150 litres left. With this we can ... We can plough 10 hours. We must choose between the tractor or the transmitter. Pessou? - I'm for the tractor, of course. -You can give me 10 litres? Agree for 10 litres? Yes, we've still got the mare for ploughing. What about going to see at the "Bastide" with the tractor. You'll go first, to clear the way with your shovel? So do we keep 10 litres for Colin? Who's against it? We'll see. If there's some left. (mumble)...wash yourselves. What is she saying? - She say, we stink. - She's right. If it rains, get inside. It may be dangerous. So? If the film is black, the rain is rotten. - Radioactive, tell it straight. - Radioactive. 55, 56, 57... 71... 78 It's white. It's alright. Can we go? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! - Mommy! - She can see, Momo. What are you doing? Are you mad? I didn't know. You can see they're all dead. Red Red Black Yellow Oh shit! It should work. You should take them off, they'll be overdone. No, it's ok. They're old, you know. Did you salt it? Will you stop running around her? She's not a child anymore. See the fire? No time. No time. No time. If he bothers you tell me. Maybe thrushes. Stop! It's not mature! It's not mature! Stop! Stop! For God's sake! Be careful! Stop, shit! It's nothing. We should rub him down with Arnica. - We need a fifth gun? - If you want mine... What was it? We killed 3. Who were they? Unfortunates. People stealing our wheat. People we knew? No, no one we knew. Alright. Do you remember the old shipwreck stories? When there's a raft, everybody wants to get in. So the ones on the raft cut the other's hands off. What else could we do? I don't know. But they're men, there's not many left. We're men too. We managed to survive and that's all. Because we were lucky? And then? We must defend ourselves. Who doesn't think the same? I think the same. How long since... it happened. 6 months? More? I've counted 7 full moons. In the beginning, we couldn't see a thing. It's strange, not to be alone anymore. 18, 19, 20 They're 22. What are they waiting for? Do you really think we have to go? We can't stay like this. Do you see us playing sentinel every night? And if they ask to talk? Bring one back, we'll see. He's our Messiah, you're the one These 2 curs, we killed them like beasts but we buried them like men. When I ordered to shoot, I heard you whispering. You didn't have to whisper! Don't forget our pact! Our pact with God. God chose us. We're the only survivors on earth. And it's here, and by us that the new roots of humanity will be born. That's it. They got uniforms. Let's go? Not all of them. With the guns? No. You think so? Come closer! Come on! We're from Malevil. Have you got I.D? Bouvreuil, chemist. deputy mayor Colin our electrician We'd like to see the one in charge. We killed 3 of them. How do we address your boss? Mr. Director! Hands up! Don't panic! It's forbidden to talk to the strangers. The distribution of supplies has been postponed! We are the first survivors. Have a seat. Where do you come from? From Malevil. - Where is it? - 15 Km from here. - How many are you? - 8. How did you find us? Hunting the thieves. We heard your shots. What do you want? Nothing, we just thought... it was natural, considering the situation to let you know that you're not the only ones to survive. I'm a chemist. Malevil, is that a village? It was. There's only a piece of the castle left. I think Cathy's from there. Do you want me to get her? Have you got milk? Yes. And wheat. And you? Hello, Mr Colin. Do you recognise this man? It's the chemist. Mr Bouvreuil, we have a sick man here, would you agree to see him? Do you have any medicine? Yes. I don't know if they're appropriate, but we have some. Certainly, I can. Thank you, Mr Director. I know how good you are. Thank you. Thank you. How did you find a doctor? It's hard these days. I hope it's not measles. I'm not lucky, really. I've become a burden, Mr Director. He's feeling a bit congested. It's not scurvy? We're very well-fed here Doctor, you know. Mr Director is looking after us, just as his own children. We're all his children. - It's nothing. - Really, Doctor? I'd like so much to come back. Can I see your medicine. That; very good. Rhinoglucinal, perfect. That's what your friend needs. We've got a sick woman too, you can save her. Take it. We'll meet again, one is enough for now. Thank you. Does your friend talk that much usually, or is it because of the fever? No, he always talks that much. This should cure him. But I'm worried, I must admit it. - Two spoonfuls mornings and nights. - Before each meal. We only take one meal, in the evening. So 2 spoonfuls in the morning, and 2 before the meal. Our prison. Very good. I don't want to seem nosy, Mr Director but my duty would be to stay, your man's health worries me very much. Perfect. - I'll get a room ready for you. - Thank you. I think it's better like this. Tell them in Malevil, that we'll take good care or your doctor. - We didn't read this one? - This one? - Let's read this one. - Who was it for? Mr Pascal Jaquet. C.E bank Calls. (City) Lot (district) Where's that? - Do you want me to read it or not? - Read it. Read! Read! My dear Pascal. I must have left my umbrella in your car, I hope this mistake won't have any consequences. Don't forget to tell me, if you come on monday or saturday. I've got a book to give you from Roland. We're waiting for you. I've seen it. I saw a woman locked up. I saw handcuffs in the bog. I tell you, this guy is a lunatic. And they have a locomotive. Shit! You're pissing me off! Admit that you'd like to open this loco for your transmitter. I don't deny it, and I never will. Yes, I'd like to have those batteries, but that's not the point, I tell you this guy is nuts. I'd rather shoot myself, than fall into his hands. - What do you want us to do? - I think we must go. - With the guns? - Of course, it's better. No? You should go to bed. They've got women too. Didn't expect this, you? Didn't expect this? Momo! It's Cathy! It's Cathy! If we refused to make love, he'd beat us. Especially since you came, it's been worse than before. He met another psycho, he came with his gang He calls himself "The Commandant". Everyday, for hours, you have to repeat the same thing. We're the only survivors. God wants us to have children. That he's our Lord. But who's "He"? Fullbert, the Director. Did he let you go, or did you run away? I ran away with Judith. He drove her insane. He took her back! Who's that Fullbert? I don't know what he was doing before. He became the Chief, just like that, right away. He made us bury the dead. What have you got to eat there? There were goods in the train. Cans, a bit of everything. You know there was also the farm near the tunnel. Oh, yes. The "Villedieu". It's Albert's. Then he locked up the supplies, with the handcuffs. We heard explosions, many times. Was it from you? No. There were men in this train? None of them tried to defend you? Yes, Jos. It's been a month now that he's been in jail. There was no one in the cell the other day. What you saw isn't the jail. The real jail is a hole that big, at the bottom of the loco. What you saw is the women's prison. It's just obscenity. And this woman, with 2 children? Emma? She's like the others. She cries. Do we hide? No! We thought we were the last survivors too. Yes, it was more simple. You came to bring us our chemist back. Not only that. - What Mr Director wants is... - I'll tell them myself! Since we met by chance. Let's make the most of it. I agree. It's a trap. No, just precautions. I know you have milk. I'm interested. We have children at the tunnel. Did you bring the medicine? 3 boxes, yes. There's something we'd like in your locomotive. Batteries. What for? A transmitter. Let's say the milk is for the medicine. What do you want for the batteries? A pig. I see you know our resources very well. Alright. Evelyne, bring some milk. - Is that enough? - For a month, yes. - We'll meet again. - Maybe. And the pig? We'll bring it when we come to take the batteries. Good. We're leaving. Are you ready, Cathy? No. - So hurry up! - No. You belong to the tunnel. You must follow us. Never. Never again. Policeman! And Judith? What did you do with her? And Jos? These gentlemen don't care about our business. They know. I told them of all your obscenities. Excuse her. Come on. If you kill Judith, I'll kill you. Bastard. You're a bastard. She won't come. Leave. Kill him. Kill him. You want war? No. But you're not alone anymore. It'll be less simple now. I could go with Pessou, you know. I want to see it myself. It's so... Too bad, you didn't listen to me. We'd be peaceful now. We'd liquidate Fullbert, we'd be secure And the tunnel people too. And the so called "Commandant", what about him? He'd not have stopped us wandering around here? One day or another, he'd attack us with his gang, and... We have to know how many guns they have. We don't have to, we must! This "Commandant" is probably no more Commandant than I am. I'll go see. This isn't war! This isn't war! Since we gave them milk. We didn't give them milk. It's a trade. These gentlemen gave us 3 boxes of vials that'll make you feel good, and in return... - We gave them a milk can. You see... if Emma were here... With her kids. So what? I'm sure she'd be the vet's kind of girl. - You think so? - Yes. She's beautiful, you know. And Judith would appeal to Emanuel. So that way, we could love each other peacefuly. - I've put the other fire out. - Thank you. Excuse me. - Where's Momo? - How should I know? Didn't expect, hum? Didn't expect. Do you know what I was telling to Colin? No. I said that at the tunnel, there's a woman you'd like. Her name's Emma. Emma. General call. General call. General call. Amateur radio. Frequency... General call Be careful. Here they come. To the river. You loved him that much? Oh yes. We don't want to kill you, that's been enough of this. How many were you? Twelve, the others are dead. Where do you come from? I come from the "Bastide". Any survivors there? There were around ten. They're dead? - The Commandant killed them. - Why? The Commandant attacked our convoy. He killed my dad and recruited me. And you? I've seen you before. I'm from the tunnel. Corporal Franois Lon. What were you doing with them? It's a Director's order. He's not dead this one? What do you mean? The Director prefered to send the others to death. Is Judith still in jail? Yes. Except at night. What do you think about all of this? It's war. Do you know what The Commandant was doing before? He was a doctor. Do you want this war to go on? What was planned? We're supposed to win. And then? We'd settle in Malevil. The Director actually, what is he doing? He must await The Commandant's return. Keep an eye on him. We're not many, but I'll not let you live. You're a man from before the disaster. You don't deserve to survive. From now on the tunnel's law will be the only law. If Malevil has survivors, they'll obey. Or they'll die. Any prayers to say? No. The Commandant asks that all prisoners be judged at the same time. Very well! Bring Judith. Since it's a trial, I'll give you a chance. You'll interrogate Judith, If you can make her confess her crimes I'll pardon you. Let Jos out! I'm listening. Did you disobey The Commandant or the Director? I didn't disobey. They raped me. Didn't you refuse to smile at them? Yes. You see. How do you explain that The Commandant didn't kill the Director? I forbid you to ask this question. The prisoner doesn't want to come. How's that, he doesn't want to come? The prisoner doesn't want to come? It's Malevil! Judith! -Cathy! You'll not blame me for the alliance with The Commandant? You'd be all dead today. If I pretended to be friendly. And you're here; happy to welcome Malevil. Where's the prisoner? He's there! He's there! You were right, you know. The Commandant wanted to kill me. That's why I told him about Malevil. Of course, I shouldn't have. Anyway, it's over now. Jos. He's dead? He didn't want to live enough. Well done! Poor Mr Bouvreuil. If he hadn't been here... We wouldn't be together. What'll become of us? We're here. Look! The mule! Reassured? We'll never have enough plates. We'll have to build another house. Can you imagine? How long we'll have to survive to replace all the ones who died? Intervention unit n 7 speaking! Regroup quickly for immediate evacuation! Don't take anything with you! You must board immediately!
