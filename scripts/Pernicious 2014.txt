I just got bit already. So this is Thailand. It looks amazing. We're really out in the sticks here, aren't we? This is gonna be an unforgettable experience. Yeah, well, after a train ride to a cab ride to a boat ride, that was quite an experience in itself. Don't be such a sourpuss. Come on, this place is huge. Yeah, but the words freaky and run down come to mind. You know what, I'm just relieved it's not a hut, OK? Why would it be a hut? It's Southeast Asia, teaching children. I expected a hut. This isn't much better. Come on, sis. We're in Thailand. We're saving the world. Enjoy it. All right, how about we just go inside like normal people would do? OK, we're teaching small children the alphabet. We're not curing cancer. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Jeez. What were you doing? Nothing. Just admiring that cool dollhouse looking thing. It's actually called a spirit house, and it's sacred in Thai culture. How am I supposed to know that? What's that supposed to mean? Ah, Alex, ignorance truly is bliss. Wow, I'm so glad I'm not related to you two. Wait. I don't get it. OK. Oh, come on. What are you doing? Stuck. Probably because it's a piece of crap. Come on, let me see. Uh. Oh! What do you know? Not so ignorant after all, huh? I swear, I'm gonna smack her at some point this summer. Well, wait until she's drunk so it doesn't hurt as bad. Love you Al, I swear. OK. Ugh. Hey, don't judge a book by its cover, right? It's not completely unfortunate. Wow, it's so old. How old do you think? Like, thousands of years? I don't know. See? I told you it's amazing. Just like the woman at the housing office said. I call dibs on the biggest room! Noted. Well, it only is fair, since I never doubted the place. Like I said, it's not completely shitty. You said unfortunate. But I meant shitty. OK, girls, do you want to see the rest of the rooms? I'm just going to remind you guys that I called dibs. I don't remember that conversation. Jules, do you remember anything about a dibs being called? Ah, uh-uh. No. You know, I... I don't remember anything about that. You guys are hilarious. Sorry. I don't know if we're supposed to be up here. I'm sure it's fine. Ooh. Guys, look at this. Looks like traditional Thai couch or something. Comfy. Whoa. It looks really old. Is that gold? No way. It's probably paint. Look, it's chipping right there. It's so cold. It's really pretty. Well, if it's an antique, you shouldn't be touching it, Al. You're right. Really? Uh, OK, I'm a little bit creeped out by this, so let's I don't want to be responsible for breaking an ancient statue, OK? All right, girls, what's the plan? Now, we can go get food, go to town, get tequila shots. What? Sleep. OK. Sleep it is. Come on. Oh, hey, baby. Nice shirt. What are you up to? Just waking up. Checking in on my little lover. What time is it over there? Noon. Oh. I see you're putting your summer TAing off to good use. Well, you know, the whole reason I'm becoming a professor is so I can have the summers off, not have to wake up at the crack of dawn. I remember somebody telling me Thailand is an amazing and magical land. So how are the sisters? Crazy and crazier? Hey guys. What's for breakfast? I'm starving. What? There's no food in this house. Yep. All we could find was this tea. Hmm. All right, then. Who wants to go to town? What the heck? It's probably just the wind. Sir? Sir? Are you OK? He looks comatose. Except he's standing. Uh, hold on. We don't speak Thai. Oh. Um. Well, sorry to bother you. Many apologies. Is he OK? Yeah. Yeah. He just likes to wander off sometimes. Again, very sorry. Thank you. Well, that was creepy. But I'm hungry, so let's go. Wow, someone's good at compartmentalizing. You have no idea. Ooh, let's stop here for a sec. I want to look at something. Hmm. Purses. You don't even wear jewelry. When in Rome. Is this a dragon? Oh, um, hello. How much does this cost? 90 baht. It's about $3.00 American. What? OK. Um, Al, what do you think of this bag? Um, yeah, that bag... that bag's cool, I think. I guess. OK. I'll buy it. So, girls, what's the plan for tonight, huh? I mean, we only have a week before the work starts. Thank you. And by the work, you mean helping lovely, helpless little children and the joy that comes with that, right? Yes, that is exactly what I meant. Mmhmm. Yes. What about you, Al? Um, what? The club. I think those guys are following us. That's a weird subject change. No, seriously. I saw them when you were buying your purse. Hey, you guys want something or what? Yeah, right? Oh, come on, Al. Don't worry. I'm sure they're harmless. Whatever. OK, so, um, change, thank you? So, what's the vote? Thank you. Vote, vote? Yeah, club sounds fun. Tonight? OK. Yeah, we'll dance, drink, make bad decisions. It'll be like a Tuesday for you. Oh, hilarious. OK, I'm in, too, but just as an observer, because I have a boyfriend. Well, all the more reason to drink. Uh-huh. Lame. I seriously think Shane might propose soon. Eew. That sounds awful. No, it's... it's a good thing. Would you actually say yes? We've been together four years, so, you know. Jeez. I think my longest relationship was... does five weeks even count? You guys ready for another round? Yeah. Oh, we should get that big, um, that fishbowl thing with, like, the giant straws. Yes! Yes! That sounds like a hangover in a bucket. That sounds like a bucket of fun. A bucket of fun? Fine, fishbowl. It sounds amazing, and you're gonna love it. Can we drink all that? Of course. You gonna let me buy you a drink? Oh, hello. No, thank you, actually. My girlfriends and I are gonna do a fishbowl thing, so. Hey, hey, please. Let Colin take care of it. Really not a problem. Oh. Did he just refer to himself in the third person? OK, Colin, I'm sorry, but I'm just not interested. I might be interested. Rachel. Where are you guys from? America, right? Yes. Mm-hm. I fucking knew it. What is it, go the Lakers, yeah? Yes, I'm American and I love the Lakers. You're from Michigan. Same thing. What... what are you, like, British? Yeah, I'm London born and bred. Gonna let me buy you a drink or not? No. I'm just not interested. Still there? Knock knock. Who's there? The guy you just made a dickhead out of. Thanks for that. Much appreciated. Wow. You're welcome! Honestly, who was that? Rachel, do you see his friends? Yeah, they're super cute. I like the mature gentleman. No, those are the guys that were following us earlier. What? Oh my gosh. You guys are so bad. It's dark in here. It's hard to see. Alex, are you sure that's them? I'm positive. Yes, it's definitely them! I'm going there. I'm going to go talk to them. Rachel, no, no, no! Rach! Oh, Rachel. Oh, God. Some girl's coming. Hello. Hi. You guys following us? Rachel. Give me some of that. Definitely not. Don't believe you, but OK. Are you a model? I could be. BRB. Grab yourself. We're moving spots. Oh, good, we're leaving. No, like we are joining them. No. What? Yes. They're nice and they're cute and they're male. Did I mention that they were male? Do I need to remind you that these cute, nice guys were also stalking us about, like, six hours ago? Rach, are you sure about this? Come on. Yes, I'm sure. They just thought that we were models. Oh. I don't care what they think that we look like, OK? I have a boyfriend. Eew, god, look at them. They won't stop staring at us. They're not creepy. They're British. And that means that they are intelligent. Mm-hm. Yes. And besides that, you guys are not going to be ruining this for me. Do you know how long it's been since I've gotten laid? Yeah. A really long time, OK? So you have to take one for the team here. Come on, Jules. Please? Please? No, I'm not. I'm not going over there. God, no. I'll stay in my fishbowl. I didn't want to have to do this, but Vegas. There was a swimming pool. And there was an emergency room. That's what I thought. Oh my God. I saved your ass. You owe me. You fucking owe me. Fine. Fine, OK? But then this is over. We are even. You hear me? We're even! Even! Even Steven. Even Steven. Yes. All right. All right. Got the bowl. Yes! Knew you'd be back. Oh, OK, back up, limey. Fine, fine. Slowly, babe. I'm drunk. Right. Watch your head. Whoa. Yeah. So this is the house. Old house. I like it. All right? Oh, yeah, I'm fine, thanks. It's all right. No. You don't have to play like them. We can just cuddle. No. Um, see, I, um... I'm not gonna bite. I have, um... you see... oh my God! Shoot. Hey, guys, do you have any drinks in the house? Uh-uh. No fucking drinks? No whiskey, no vodka? You got some ganja, right? No, we don't have any ganja in our house. Look, don't worry, yeah? Because if I put my hand in my back pocket... oh, yes! Come on, get up, get on it. Three cheers, baby. Let's drink. Come on. Come on. You're so pretty. For me? Drink. Knock it back. Ooh, knock it back! Yeah, baby, yeah! Good girl. Professional right here. Oh, yeah. No, I... no. I had a lot at the bar. Take some. Come on. Come on, it's OK. What's in here? Alcohol. Just alcohol. Yeah! Aren't you gonna have some? No. I don't drink. Drin... what the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing, Julia? You're a crazy bitch. Stay away from me. Byron! You're dead. You're dead! Don't you come near me. Don't you come near me. Fuck off away from me. Fuck off away from me with that! Help! Byron! Byron! Stay away from me. Don't, please, please, don't. Don't... don't do that. Don't do that, please. Stay away from me. What are you doing? You fucking crazy bitch! Help! Help! God! What are you doing? Please! Please, don't! Stop it, please stop it! What are you doing? No! No! Stay away. Please, sorry, I'm sorry, please. Please don't. Help me, please, help me. Stay away. Stay away. Help me! Someone help! Help! Please, please, please, don't. No! No, no, no, no, no! Go! Go! Help, help, help! Look I... Someone help! Help! Help! No! Please! Help! Help! Please, stop! What are you doing? No! Stop, please, help! Stop! Alex, you're up before I am? I know, I'm as shocked as you are. Ugh. I did not sleep well last night. I had the strangest dream. What kind of dream? Violent. Disgustingly violent. Remind me never to drink from a British man's flask ever again. Yeah. That feels like it was a mistake. I had a similar dream. It was disturbing. I killed Colin. In my dream, I mean. Yeah, I had the same dream. But it was Byron. We were roofied. Those guys roofied us last night, didn't they? I mean, that would explain it. This is why we're feeling so disoriented today. It explains us blacking out. That dream was so real, though. God. I Ugh. I... I honestly feel really sick right now. So where are the guys? Not here. Wait a minute. My jewelry's gone. No! Oh, god! All my stuff is missing, too! They stole the bracelet mom gave me before she died. Hey. Listen. Rach. We're gonna get it back. We're gonna get it back. I promise. Come here. It's OK. Byron! Are you here? Give me back my shit! Colin! Vlad! Are you fucking kidding me? Look. Those bastards robbed us, and they even took the stupid statue. Why would they take a worn down statue? This is bullshit. This doesn't make any sense. If... if they robbed us, why didn't they take something more valuable, like computers or... or cell phones, or iPods, or cash? This just doesn't add up. Yeah, I guess. Maybe they were in a hurry. Alex, the statue would be heavy. It's not like an in a hurry kind of thing. This isn't good. No, no, this is... this is not good, you guys. What the hell happened last night? I mean, first I'm freaked that we killed them, and now I'm pissed that they robbed us. I mean, which is it? Jules, calm down. We'll figure it out. What are we going to do? If that statue was an antique or something, it would be worth a lot of money. How much money? I don't know. Thousands? I mean, I'm not stupid. I've seen antique roadshows. It's not like we're renting the place, OK? The program put us up here, and they can't hold us accountable for everything inside. Yes they can. I think that we should just tell them everything, before they think that we took that thing whilst fleeing the country. Jules, is honesty really the best policy in this situation? I mean, it's not like we're in the right state of mind. Everyone's a little freaked out. Yes, I do. Well, what do you think? I guess so. But if we end up in a Thai prison, I'm not digging cockroaches out of your ears. I'm making the call. Hello? This is Julia. So, listen, somebody broke into our house and they took all of our gold jewelry and even some personal items. Yeah. And I hate to say this, but, um, they took that life-size gold statue. What do you mean, there is no gold statue? What did she say? Are we screwed? What? Was it like 1,000 years old? She said there is no statue. What? Yeah. I told her the whole story. I even described the statue in full detail. And the program housing director said there is no statue at this residence, but she'll look into it. She'll look into it? Yeah. That was it. I think she thought I was crazy or something. So I guess we're off the hook. This can't be right. It was right there. Right? I remember it, too. I think. You think? Well, I don't know. At this point, I... I barely even remember last night, let alone the guys leaving this morning. So yes, I am doubting my memory a little. Look, I know it's been a crazy morning, but I'm hungry. Can we please just go get some food and talk about all this serious stuff later? Yeah, I... I need a break from all this. OK, let's just get some food and then find out more about the statue later. Why are we trying to replace the statue when the program thinks it was never there? I just want to find out how much that thing was worth. We're not crazy. That statue was in the house. I don't know, Rach. Do we even care what it's worth now? I mean, it's gone. I already feel guilty enough. Yes. Isn't this bugging you? I mean, where did it go? The guys stole it, remember? Yeah, I thought that, too. But something just feels off. Excuse me, sir. Um, do you have any of these, but made of gold? Oh, yeah. Many, many statues. What you like? Very good price. Uh, like this, but made of real gold, and like a child. Yes? No, like a very young looking little girl. Um, like her size. But real gold, not paint. Real child, real gold? Do... do you know what that means? What kind of statue that is? No. I don't have any more. Don't sell here anymore. Uh, do you know what I'm talking about, though? Do you understand? Understand, yes. But we don't have. We don't do that here. Good shop. Very good shop. Thank you. Goodbye. OK. Thank you. Hi. Can I help you? Or not. Rach! Rachel! Don't follow the creepy Asian girl! Rach! Oh, good, we caught up. Yeah. Now we can all get murdered together. What is this place? It's disgusting. I don't know. Man, it looks like some sort of abandoned village or something. Oh my god, how is she not out of breath? I don't know. She's a child? Oh. I think she wants us to go inside. Thoughts? Well, we're here, aren't we? Oh my god, let's just get the hell out of here, OK? This place is a shithole. And she's a drunk. Shh! Hi. Um, we're looking for a statue. It's gold, like a child. Got one? Not like that. Um, this one's different. It's, uh... it's gold, like, um, like this. Real gold. I don't think I have what you want. The little girl from the market implied that you would. The little girl? She's right there. She was right there. Alex. All right. All right, well, thank you. Let's go. Yeah, uh,. Um, whatever. Thank you. We're just going to go. Stop! This is the golden statue, just like you said. Yes, that's it! What is it? Kumari, the golden girl. Is that gold real? Yes. Very special. Very rare. Very old. So I guess you're not selling it, then. Not for sale. Very, very good luck. Is this why you want one? We had one, but we lost it, or it was stolen. We're not really sure what happened to it. How did you get it? Did you buy it on the black market? No! It was in our house. Kumari is meant to be worshipped. Born from a very dark place. It is meant to bring light. It's just a statue. Not just any statue. It chose you. You know what? I've... I've had just about enough of this. Kumari is a child of great sacrifice, but it is a child no less. It feels jealousy, anger, resentment. Kumari led you here. She escaped. Lady say what? The little girl, she is a vision. Not real. Bullshit. She is following you. She is your statue. You let her out. What the hell are you talking about? These are for your protection. You must wear them to keep her out. The kumari, she has turned on you. She is ready to take her revenge. OK, I've had enough freaky for the day. Yeah, right behind you. You know you sound nuts, right? If you knew what it took to make a kumari, you would see things differently! So what now? Guess we go home. Great. That sounds like a blast and a half. Alex, what are you doing? of junk given to you by a drunken old woman to keep you safe? Please. It's your funeral. I'm gonna put you where everyone can see you. All right. So, Julia tells me you guys want to know a little bit more about this Thai legend. The kumari. We're getting more into the culture. Oh yeah? Because I thought it was some creepy old lady that told you a ghost child was haunting you. Well, it was that, too. I filled him in. Obviously. All right. Well, it turns out this is some pretty serious shit, all right? When a kid died violently, in some horrific accident or whatever... what they would do, they would take the body, cover it in blood, dry burn the bones, and encase the damn thing in gold. All part of this ritual, the kumari. Supposed to bring good luck. That's gross. And it gets worse. A lot of necromancers... they wanted more children. So what they would do... they would go out there and actually start murdering. And eventually, the Thai government banned the practice, but they still do it, and they sell them on the black market for thousands of dollars. Oh my god. That's why that old lady asked where we got it. It was actually supposed to be worshipped. And from what I hear, you guys kind of failed on the worship part and let it get away. Oh my god, it was stolen. How was that our fault? Well, the old witch said that we let it escape, so maybe that's what she meant. I don't think it physically escaped. I think it had to do more with the spirit of the child. Like it was trapped? Yeah. And now it wants revenge. Best advice I can give you? Shane? Shane? Shit, my computer just died. Did that really just happen? Yeah. What are the odds? He's like, you guys should, then zap. Thank you, Alex. That was a super helpful recap. OK, new plan, we move. As in leave this house? Yes, as in we go to the housing office tomorrow I mean, do you think they're going to be OK with that, and not just think we're three spoiled Americans part of our volunteer work? I really don't care what they think. Thai statue or no statue, this... this house... it's giving me a really bad feeling. The Brits and the old man, and... and the statue... Well, the Brits were my fault. That's true. And Alex's. - Not really. - You know what? It doesn't matter whose fault it is. Everything about this just screams get the hell out! You serious? OK. It's not real, it's not real, it's not real. Bloody clothes. Oh my God! Someone! Somebody help me! Get me the hell out of here! Oh my God, oh my God! There's something in there! I felt it! There's something in the bathroom. The girl was in the bathroom. I saw her, and suddenly... I was in there, and there was this thing in the closet, and it started crawling in the... Rachel, I saw her in the water, and then in the mirror. It was the girl. Hey! Hey! Everybody shut up. Julia, get dressed. Go. What is going on? I don't know. We can't stay here. I'm seriously freaked out right now. Me too, but where are we gonna go? It's the middle of the night. It's not like we're in freaking Bangkok! We're in the sticks of Thailand! Well then, we'll call a cab, and we'll have it take us somewhere more populated. Who has a cell phone? I haven't had service since I got here. Shit. We're sleeping upstairs. All right? Safety in numbers. And then I think we need to go see that old lady. - No, no, no, no, no. - Yes. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yes. No! You said we were just going to switch houses. That seems like a much, much safer plan. I don't think it's the house. I think it's the girl. Mmm. Wake up. Mm-mm. Wake up. God, Rach. You guys ready? I guess. OK. Is that mud? On the floor? We probably just tracked it in yesterday. Come on, let's go. Come on. Where is she? Oh, this is not a good sign. Great. WE came all the way down here, and she's not even around. Something doesn't feel right. No, not at all. Come on. What are you doing here? Excuse me. So sorry. Uh, he used to know the family that lived here, many years ago. Now he gets confused and forgets that they're no longer with us. Is he OK? Yeah, he's fine. I'll just take him home. Wait. What is that? What is he holding? He's not making any sense. I'm sorry again. No, why was he pointing at us? He said, you all took it from her. He knows something about this. I can feel it. Oh my god. Did you see the way he was pointing at us? It's like we did something wrong. It's that amulet. The one he was holding. Yeah, from the spirit house. Excuse me? When we first arrived, I snatched it from the spirit house. Oh. I thought it looked cool. I don't know how he got it, though. That spirit house that is now full of dead flowers? Yeah, that one. All right, I'm going over there. He can help. No, Rachel, he doesn't even speak English! You heard him. He is insane. Jules, we're having horrifying murder dreams, seeing little girl ghosts... I'm going over there, OK? I want this to stop. Fine. Creepy house across the way it is. Oh, it's you. How can I help you? I need to talk to that old man. Yeah, it's an emergency. I'm sorry, but he's resting now. Please? You can translate! Excuse me, but this is very rude. Look, I know he barged into your house. I'm sorry. But he's not well. Please. I'm really sorry, but this is urgent. We need you to ask him about the previous owners of that house to see if there's a connection. Connection to what? To the amulet that he took. OK? And then there's this little girl statue that went missing, and I just need to talk to him, OK? I am not going to ask him anything about that. He said he'd help you. Thank you. The old house belonged to his brother Tiwa many years ago. Tiwa had a beautiful wife named Samorn and a daughter named Vanida. MALE SPEAKER Tiwa was a good brother, and a good man. Samorn was pregnant, and they knew they were going to have a son, which was something they had always wished for. But Samorn was very ill. She had gone to see many doctors, but none of them could help her. Tiwa was very desperate. He went to see a fortune teller in the village. Some people called her a witch. She was known for communicating with the dead. Her name was Isra. Tiwa asked her. Tiwa begged her to save the life of his wife and unborn son. He said he would do anything. She asked him if he would really do anything. Isra told him that he would have to trade one life for another. But they would have to come from the same bloodline. Tiwa realized that this meant that he would have to give up not only his own life, but that of his young daughter, Vanida. He did not want to do this, but he felt he had no other choice. Isra explained that there was a way to keep Vanida's spirit alive. She said if she was covered in the blood of a tortured human, Tiwa's blood, and then encased in gold, that her spirit would live on forever and could bring luck to her family. Tiwa agreed to do this, but his wife was not happy. But he could not let his wife and son die. She asked Tiwa not to do it, but Tiwa was determined to save his wife and unborn son, no matter what the cost. He asked me for a favor. He asked me to help with this ritual, to bring my tools and gold from my shop. I told him no. But he begged me. What could I do? The next day, I went to his house with my supplies. We went down to the basement. Down to hell. She was so small. Too easy to kill. When it was done, we went upstairs to get Samorn. When I entered the room, I saw her. It is an image I cannot shake. There she was, hanging from the rafters, the beautiful, pregnant Samorn. She had hung herself. Everything had gone wrong. The ritual was for nothing. Isra warned me that the child's spirit would now be restless. Her death in vain. So we created the amulet and placed it in the spirit house so that her spirit would not be free to enter the world, until now. The statue in the house. It's Vanida, the little girl? And you made it and you killed her? Yes. How can we stop her? She is what she is. She's what we made her. Kumari cannot be stopped. There must be something we can do. He wants you to have this. Thank you. Will this help? We should go. I cannot believe he murdered that little girl. We need to leave right now. His brother asked him to. And we can't just leave. You heard what he said. The girl is after us. He could have said no. We wouldn't be in this nightmare. It's not that easy! These rituals are real to them. He probably thought he was really helping. Are you serious right now? He killed Vanida! He sliced her open, drained her blood, and covered her in gold! Like a doll! And for what? For an unborn child? Al, calm down! Don't tell me to calm down! Give me that! There. It's done. What's with the salt, Al? Saw it on TV. Shh. It's coming from Sang's house. We need to get over there. No. D-don't you think we should just call the police? We have no service! What if he's in trouble? - What do we do? - There's no time. Let's go! You killed him! You killed him! Just like you killed your brother and Vanida! Why? Why did you do this? Why did you do it? No! Oh God, oh God, oh God. This is bad. This is bad. This is so bad, Julie. Shut up. So so so, this is so bad. Julia, shut up. Shut up? I just murdered somebody! Don't tell me to shut up! We murdered somebody. We're all here. It's all our fault, OK? We need to leave right now. What are we gonna do with the body? Rachel, there are two bodies here! Leave them! Let's just go. Guys, come on. I don't blame you, Julia. It had to be done. No it did not have to be done. I killed someone. He was a murderer. I cannot believe what I'm hearing right now! What is wrong with you? Let's not talk about it right now, OK? We need to leave this country. As in get on a plane. Everyone, go pack. I'm... I'm... Julia, just go pack! All right! Where's that coming from? I don't know! I don't remember there being a door there. Come on, Rach, it's just a closet. Let's go. It's the basement. Alex, are you down there? Guys, get down here. You've gotta see this! God, what is that smell? Ugh. God. This look familiar to anyone? Oh, God! I dreamt this. So did I. I know it was redundant, but me three. Alex, this isn't funny. No one said it was. It was us, wasn't it? That's impossible. The bloody clothes. What bloody clothes? In my room. I found them. I didn't know what to do. And now it makes sense. It was us. It was always us. You're wrong. It started out as us. Then you two put your amulets on, and then it was just me. Finally free. Alex, what are you doing? Showing you what I can do. What are you talking about, Alex? Your witch is dead. I smashed her fucking face in the jungle. And the nurse? Did him, too. Oh, and the old man? Well, you guys were there for that. That... that was fun. Good job, Julia. I didn't think you had it in you. Alex, we're your family. You're not my family. Alex, what are you doing? Stop! No. Alex. Alex! Stop! What are you doing? Alex, it's OK! It's me, it's Julia! Alex, please! Stop it, Alex! It's Julia. Stop. Alex, what are you doing? Please, stop! Alex, stop! Alex, stop! Stop! No! No! No! No, stop it! No! Oh my god! Listen to me! I love you! I love you, I'm your sister! Please stop! God! No! Please! No! No, stop it! Alex, why are you doing this? Alex, please! Listen to me! Listen to me, I love you! Don't hurt me! Please, you're my sister! Vanida, stop. I know you're here. You don't have to do this. I know they did horrible things to you, but it wasn't us. Give me back my sister! They took everything from me! They took my life, they took my blood, and for what? To give themselves luck? For someone else's life? You three came in here, entitled, smug, arrogant. You have everything I ever wanted. But you set me free. It wasn't us. Hey, babe. What's going on? I was just about to go to sleep. Alex? What's up? Alex? You all right? What's going on? Something happened to Julia. You need to fly out here right away.
