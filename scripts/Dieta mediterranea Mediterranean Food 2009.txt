This is the story of the three of them. MEDITERRANEAN FOOD - Someone, get a car! - Let's take the scooter, start it. - Don't take the scooter! - Why? You won't make it. Take the pan and casseroles out of the fire. My mum was bum unannounced on June 6th 1968, at the lunch rush hour. And turn the gas oh'! Go. On the day Sofia is born, Toni's cleaning with the paper announcing Robert Kennedy's murder. Meanwhile, Frank is about to receive a horrible punishment. Toni studies, Frank doesn't. Toni helps his father, Frank plays with his stepfather's gun. Dad! Pete, help us, she's giving birth! Make her sit here. Be careful. - What should we do? - Put her legs up. The baby really wants out. Bring towels! - A smoke. - It's fine, the head comes first. Sofia is bum weighing surrounded by men in need of a haircut. She's beautiful. Sofia. Some time later, she can prepare the secret sauce for fries. She also learns that boys are nicer when their stomach is full. - Here. - Thank you. - A hot dog! - Ok! She finds out that dancing is about being leaded. Sandwiches, the nicest sandwiches! When she's eight, Sofia starts showing shat an artist. At 20, Frank learns languages with native speakers. At the age of 15, Toni saves two English women and a Dutch man. - What's in them? - Ham, pineapple and lettuce. - And in those? - Tuna fish and cherry. Tuna fish and cherry? My favorite are sardines and chocolate, but the sun melts them. - Do you make them yourself? - It's 50 pesetas. It's good, but not the best. I'll give you 25. Hey, what are you doing here? You should be at school. Sofia! Come. Sofia! There's no need to hide. I'm not hiding. I just met your teacher. - You failed. - I know. You're only interested in boys. Studying is useless. I don't learn and I don't like it. You'd rather go shopping and being admired? - Every girl... - You'd better be quiet, - you fill her head with nonsense. - Me? Yes, you tell her she's the tallest, the prettiest, the most clever. I'm not retaking the course, I want to work. - Where? - In my dad's kitchen. Your hair will always smell. Does my hair smell? I want you to have a clean job, so you can wear decent clothes and have weekends free. - Take that off! - I don't want to. Ramon... - Take that off! - I don't want to! OK, stop. Don't hit your mum. Stop. But she's right. Only useless people are cooks. That's right. I'll show you who I am. I can be anything. I you leave, don't ever come back! Baby! Where are you going? Should I follow her? I told you I'd kick you out if I caught you drinking. The fish stew's perfect! You can't hit me, I'm the chef! You can't kick me out, you're not the boss. You screw the owner, that's different. I work long hours, I know each costumer by name, their favorite wine, everything. You know who it is I screw? The public. I know what they want, it's not you. So get out, you piece of shit. You won't be able to feed - Out. - Asshole. He): Can you offer me a job? Maybe. - What can you do? - Fish stew. - And sardines with chocolate. - That, too. Come on, help chop onion and tomato. Listen. If someone annoys you or touches your ass, tell me and I'll kill them. OK. - Come on. - Let's go. Toni! Have you seen Sofia? She ran away again? She's terrible. It's about the girl who committed suicide She was Swedish. The Swedish have the highest suicide rate. It must be the climate. No, it's the butter. They cook everything with butter. - Should I fill it? - No, it's full. - If I see her, what should I say? - Nothing, I'll wait here. Excuse me! Can you take me to the station? Please! I'm late for work. Please. OK, OK, let's go. So, you speak Italian. I understand a little. I was in the navy. Have you been to Venice? What should I tell her if I see her? Here, your part, you've done fine. - Can I work with you? - No. - How much are you paying? - Nothing, this is not good for you. - Study. Be a secretary. - What about you? - What about me? - Did you study a lot? I'll have my own restaurant. Me too. You bet. Cooking is not for women. - Aren't there any female cooks? - No. - Why? - Women don't cook for money. I do. That's because you're no woman, yet. Then you're not a man. - I'll take you home. - I don't have a home. - Don't be a pain or... - Or what? What are you doing? Frank, what are you doing? Let me go! Frank, let me go! You'll see! Goddammit. What are you doing? Motherfucker! Hey, my KEYS - Give me the keys. - I don't want to. Give me the keys. Fill it. It's super. - Why are you with him? - What'? - Your dad's worried. - Are you gonna fill it? - Come on, out of the car. - I don't want to. Not you, her! Take the hose - and fill it in. - Come on. - She's underage, you asshole! - What? You'll see! Take your hands off my car. You're underage? - She's 16, you asshole! - 17, you idiot! If you call me asshole, I'll have to punch you. - Really? - Yes. Asshole. Asshole, asshole, asshole. - Are you stupid? - Did you abuse her? - What...? - Did you abuse her? - How could I, she's smarter than us. - Fuck, the cops. Idiot. - Calm down, they are my friends. - Not mine. Give me the keys. - It's your father. - I don't have a father. The keys. - Get off the car. - What? Get off, I don't want trouble. You, asshole, help me get her off. - I don't want to! - Come one, get off the car, I said. You liar, you said you'd take me to your place. Don't touch me! Son of a bitch, liar! You chickenshit! Hit him, hit him! Let me go! Hi, Frank. When are you buying me lunch? Let me go! - Stop minding my business! - I care about you. Why? Toni, come here. No, you stay there. He asked us to stop here. Lend him some clothes. We found him at the station restroom, naked and tied to a radiator. - What happened, Ramon? - Hi, Toni. Don't let Sofia see me. An omelet, not too cooked. My grandfather is out of service for a month because of a pneumonia My mum switches maths and geography for stoves. - A Spanish omelet for four! - OK! Dishes are now cooked with a new ingredient: Passion. Hooray for Sofia! The younger quickly fall in love with Sofia's cookery. In short, even older people fall for Sofia. My grandmother smells business and finds recipes everywhere. Two years later, the restaurant where Frank works is no longer the best. But Toni is the best real estate agent in the area. And he's the most fervent lover in the Mediterranean. Frank tries Sofias dishes and knows he found the treasure map. Here's to my friends Loren and Ramon, who decided to join their lives Hooray for Sofia and her mum, Loren! Why are you here? You once asked me for a job. I have one now. Do you'? I want you to work for me. I just work for myself. I'll be the maitre at a four star hotel. The chef is interesting and I talked to him about you. I've been spying on you, I can make something important out of you. Can you? I can make you a great cook. Isn't this a job for men? This place is too small for you. I don't want to be a great cook. - What, then? - I want to be the best. You won't make it without help. - And that would be you. - Yes, me. Lucky you, I'm here. Come with me. You won't walk out on me again on a gas station. Understood? Calm down. I'm not offering again. - Fine. - Fine. Here. Toni... I wanted to give it to you later, but I can't wait. Oh, Toni. Toni, it's too much. How much was this? Let's announce it now, - in front of everyone. - You're crazy, Toni, my love, I can't marry and have children now. Not now, someday. I don't know if I want to marry you. Why not? We do everything together, it's as if we were married. I don't know if I'm ready, if I'm giving enough. You make me happy, you feed me, you give me everything. - I need to meet other men. - What for? When you go shopping, you don't take the first thing you see. But I'm the best in the market: Beef fillet. - What if I want pork? - Then I'll be a pig. I can be whatever you want me to be. You know I can be dirty. Toni... I really love you, but I need to go make desert, OK? You won't wear the ring so you won't drop it in the desert. - That's it, right? - That's it. So... Come on, let's say it. I can see how come you sell so many houses. I can't wait. I love you. I love you. - I'm going for a shower. Later. - Later? Later? Listen! Wait a second! Tonight we'd like to make a special announcement, but we'll do that later, so go on dancing. What's this? Sofia! Sofia! Sofia! Sofia! Wait, wait! Your father isn't a fag, OK? Do you have a light? - He must be drunk. - No... People are one thing, and your dad is both. It's usual among men who spend a long time on a boat. Don't think I'm unhappy, because I'm very happy. I hope Toni will make you as happy as I am. - Toni! - David, drive. The rest, push. I can't stand my mum, I can't. - That's who she is. - She can only give me recipes. - It's OK, isn't it? - No, it isn't. Whatever I do, it's never right. - Come on, let's go. - Who saved the bar? I did. What would they do without me? Are you gonna push or fight? - Come on. - Come on. You know what? I'm leaving. I'm leaving this shitty place - Don't be angry at me. - But... - Can I get on? - Yes, go ahead. - What about me? - There's only room for one. Thanks, Laura. - Welcome. - Thanks. Can you stop crying? Well, your room... Do you like it? Here's your key. I'll sleep upstairs. I never lock the door, come if you need anything. So you're not sleeping here? This is a professional relationship, we don't want to make mistakes. - Do we? - No. Who sleeps here, then? Hello. - I'm Nuria. - Hello. Pleased to meet you. This is my bed. Do you mind...? Sorry. - Do you also work in the kitchen? - No, I'm a waitress. I would never cook, it's all men. - You must be the new one. - Sofia. - I don't like people who pull strings. - OK. I didn't come for strings. I'm the second sub chef. I cook mains without meat. I'll be your boss. In case of doubt, ask me. - Leave the chef alone, he's nasty. - Is he? There's trout, monkfish and sole. Let's see how you fry, stew and grill. Can I use other ingredients? There's everything you need. Excuse me. You might be right. You didn't come for strings. Fresh foie grass and beef with onion sauce. Beef with orange and hare with beetroot. What about the pig's trotters and the civet? Grate some carrot and peal some potatoes. I've been steaming hake for sick people for a month. How can I become the best cook? Cooking fish in a meat restaurant? Don't laugh! You promised the best, and I can't see it! Where is it? Get off. Have you had lots of girlfriends? - I don't have girlfriends. - You don't? What, then? I do my own thing and don't depend on anyone. If I wanted you to, you'd depend on me. I would become the love of your life. Or my death. - But I won't. - What? I like your pretending to be hard. It's what I like the most about you. You came here to learn, not to play mum and dad. I didn't come to play with you. But I don't want you to let me down with this lousy menu. - What are you talking about? - The menu. There's nothing I can do, it's the Chef. You make me leave my town, my kitchen, my boyfriend, for this? In this business, one comes first, then two, then three. - I was on five. - You weren't. I don't even have a number now! - What are you doing? - Putting my pajamas on You use pajamas? And you use a nightdress, and it must be downstairs, so... - Am I sleeping in my bedroom? - Where else? So nothing happened. We fucked. We don't need to move in together. - Fine. - Fine. Fuck off, Frank. Sofia, open. It's me. Toni! Open up, it's me. What are doing here? I told you I wouldn't come, but I miss you so much, I had to. I can't accept living away from you, do you understand? Here. It's from your mum. She keeps fighting with the new cook. - How's my dad? - Better. He's handling the crutches and goes to the beach every day. - You need to come back. - I can't. I signed a contract, I can't. Fuck the contract. I love you. Jesus, you scared me! Shut up. Sorry. Let's go home. The car's at the front. - Really? - Come on. I need five minutes to pack. I'll wait at the lobby. Sofia. I'm crazy about you. I'm really crazy. - I'll wait at the lobby. - OK. I told you I... I'm working on you, OK? I'm investing time and energy because you're gifted. But I know how to do things, you don't, so we're doing it my way. I want to sleep! We can share the room, but we're not man and wife, we're partners. - Does that mean no sex? - No, it doesn't. OK, you'll help me with the fish. I'll help you as much as necessary, but don't push me so hard. Deal. Deal. Come on. Frank, - I can't go up with you. - What? Toni is downstairs. What's he doing there? - He wants me back home, with him. - And you said no. I said yes. But it was your fault. Don't push me. Sorry. - I'll talk to him. - No! You can't talk to him, he doesn't know you're here. Let's see... I told him I had a job, but didn't tell him it was with you. Why? I didn't want him to think I was following you. OK. OK. Let's see how you manage. Thanks, I owe you two turns. Why do I have to come up'? I've been thinking about it, and I can't. You can't'? Why? Didn't you read your mum's letter? - What? - Didn't you read your mum's letter? I did, but... I'm learning a lot, people are amazed with my dishes. I need to stay, do you understand? For how long? I don't know. Some months, until the contract expires. Now I need to be selfish, I need to think of myself. Shut the door. But... - There's nobody, right? - Right. - I mean, your roommate left. - I asked her to leave. You asked her to leave so that we could... I have to serve breakfast at seven. We have half an hour. Every three chilies you eat, I'll add a dish. One... Two... The day after, Frank bets for the fish dishes on the menu. He gets sea bass, turbot, tuna fish and gilthead added to the menu. The sea climbs up to the mountain, my mum steps forward in her carrier. Take over, I'm going out to talk to some clients. Excuse me, can you call me a cab? - What's wrong? - Nothing. - What's going on? - I'm pregnant. What? - No! - No, what? You can't do this to me. "Me, me". You can only say "me". - You're not keeping it. - Is that a question? It's an order. - You're very young. - My son is younger. For how long have you known? Why didn't you tell me'? - Because it's four months. - Four? Relax, the baby's not yours. And seeing you now, I'm really glad. It's mine. Tell me the truth. It's mine and Toni's, and don't pretend you care, you don't! What are you both doing here? The dining room is full! No. That's it. If you leave now, you'll never be the best cook in the world. Let's bet, Frank. Let's bet. My mum goes back home. Toni and her get married and are very happy for five years. Sofia. But five years ?y by. Sofia. Toni, bring the car. I can't feel my feet. Thanks. Are you gonna eat all the hearts? Don't come near me, I'll scream. - I just want to talk. - Help! You'll make the baby cry. Toni is about to come. He'll hit you if I ask him to. I might hit him, too. - Really? - Because of what he's done to you. - What is it? - Three children in five years. Enough? The children we made together. No, you won't kid me. That's his plan, not yours. How can you be satisfied with a lousy restaurant and a hubby who's turning you into a baby machine? I'm no baby machine! Hold the baby. Are you OK? No, I'm not. I was before. Sofia, I've been everywhere and seen a lot of people, but you don't know how good you are. I look at you and see it. Sofia, look at me. - You can get very far. - Get away from me, Frank. You're unique. If you won't see that, at least let the world see. - My baby. - You have a lot to learn. You're not holding him properly, his head is hanging. There's a wonderful chef in France, Andre. He's open and willing to teach. I talked to him and he'd love you to go take a 6 month stage there. France, I'm offering France. The cradle of modern cuisine. Toni! - I'll wait at the gas station. - Don't even dream about it. - At one o'clock. - You're on drugs. You're crazy. The baby. - The baby. - At one. Surprise! Baby, you cutie! Come, baby. Look, it's 1.250 square meters. Garage, guests house... This is the first scooter your dad had. The garden is big and representative. And a swimming pool. A swimming pool! Honey, how can we pay for all this? First things first. Let's see the house, everybody in. The sitting room Air conditioning, central heating, quality furniture. The former owner was an interior decorator. He was German. Honey, honey... How are we going to pay for this? Well... - Let's drink a toast! - Yes, let's drink a toast! Toni, come here, I'm asking how we're going to pay for this. My dad is retiring. We're selling the hair saloon. I asked for a loan, and I'll work evenings. Come here. Who's taking care of the children while I work at the restaurant? No, Sofia. The restaurant is over. It's over for you. Enough of that! That's my second surprise. Are you happy? Mum, don't! - It's only a little bit. - Don't! - Everybody should drink. - He's only four, for Christ sake! What's wrong? Three children is a lot. You've been working since you were sixteen, it's time to take a rest. I sorted it out with your parents. You should sort it out with me, I got the business back on its feet. Who's going to cook? Gambinos is closing, we'll get the cook. Go play, son. Toni, that cook is bad, he's really bad. Here you can cook as much as you want to. It's huge! Look at the garden. The children can be really happy, here. Look at them, look at them. If you give that cook my recipes, I'll kill you. I'll kill you! What's wrong? You're hungry again, right? You're so beautiful! - Let's see the bedrooms. - Not now. I'm tired, later. - But you like it, don't you? - I like it a lot. Who wants to see the jacuzzi? Come on, let's go! - I thought you'd take a cab. - No, I'll follow you. - No, let's take mine. Do you like it? - Very much. Sofia, no. If you take over, you take over. - This is crazy. - They're my children. You know how hard it is to be abandoned by your mother. - What's this about? - You can't behave with women 'cause your mum left, that won't happen to my children. No, no. No way. No. You're dumping me at a gas station again. Fine. Toni! - Toni, honey! - Be careful! Honey, don't move! - What are you doing here? - Don't move, don't move! Turn the scooter off Come on, call an ambulance. - I don't want an ambulance. - Don't take the helmet off! Where were you taking my children? - Calm down. - Shut up. - Get off! - Calm down. - Don't let him take the helmet off. - Calm down, it's OK. He wanted to help you! - I can see how he helps. - We need to take you to he hospital. I don't want a hospital, I want my wife and children! And some explanation! I don't want to be a housewife. Look at my dad. He's been hiding all his life, I don't want to hide. Hell. What? Toni, Toni! Take the children and go home. Sofia, go home, now! Toni, calm down, look at me, look at me, Toni. The ambulance is coming, don't worry. For the first time, Frank does something for Sofia without food involved. I want to cook, it's not a job. When I cook, things happen to me. - What kind of things? - Things that don't happen otherwise. You can't leave at night, like a thief, take the children and leave with this bastard. And you can't lock her in a house. I bought the house for her! I know you love her a lot, but you don't know who she is. - And you do? - Toni! - You do know who she is? - I'm not hitting back. We were happy, you sneaked in. There are a lot of women, why mine? Stop, people are staring, stop. - You love her! - He doesn't! - You do love her! - He doesn't love anybody. Tell him! - I want her in my restaurant. - What restaurant? - The one I'm opening. - Where? It doesn't matter! If you were a decent man, it would be here, with her family. This place is ugly and tasteless. Your stitches are going to come off. Are you OK? Fine, fine. The Gambinos is being transferred. Gambinos? They're not selling high because it needs improvements. - Money's not a problem. - So? I like Gambinos. The keys are at my office. Let's go see it right now. Are you interested? Do you want to see it? - Now? - Yes, now. We should redo the dining room. Let's go see it. - Yes. - Frank... Let's - Sofia. - What? - Are you coming? - Me? I'm feeding the baby. Fine, then. Frank buys the Gambinos. Toni stays with my brothers. Sofia goes where Franks says, but without him, as Toni wants. Big sins in cuisine are lust, the superficial and the unnecessary. Simplicity is very hard to get. My mum realizes the secret of French cuisine is pretending. The first exercise is for you to watch us eat. Andre-'s meals are a ceremony where every cook cooks in secret for the others to guess the author. Alexandre. Yes. Michelon. David. Joel. What are you going to do with that? Sofia was born here, and I'm taking it. I calculated the amount of hair I cut in my life. Three thousand kilos. - Are you coming for lunch? - No, I'm not hungry. I'll give the money back as soon as possible. - You don't have to. - Well... I'm going to play petanque. Give me that. - Is everything OK? - No, I fired the construction workers. And hit them too. The reformations are stopped. Can you recommend someone? - Things don't fit. - What'? If the restaurant's success is going to be Sofia, - she should own 50%. - Don't be silly, Toni! If so, I should tend to our interests and take care of the numbers, because you have no idea. Look. Here's a proposal to set up a company. Call if you have any doubts. Sofia tries to be as French as possible. Cooks 14 hours a day and at night learns the language through films. Truffaut's masterpiece, Jules et Jim. With her being far away, old enemies reach an agreement And without even noticing, Frank becomes part of the family. Grilled foie with fruit coated in caramel and fennel. What's this? It's mashed pumpkin. I'll taste it. You are a miracle. How beautiful! You look smart! What do you think? It's very stylish, isn't it'? If we open in September, we have all summer to... I'll kill him! I swear I'll kill the electrician! - Frank is great, isn't he? - He is. - And tonight... tonight... - What'? Tonight... My love, this is... This is wonderful. And you are a prince, Toni. Yes, but we're not spending so much time apart again. You promise? I promise. - Say naughty things in French. - Get off, Toni! Go ahead... - I'd jump into the water with you... - So would I. Fuck, we need to find him a girlfriend quickly. Right now! Right now! It's not working. We'll come back tomorrow. I need to see the kitchen, Frank! - There's no light. - I'll die if I don't. I'll bring some ?ashlights. It's not going to work. Now it's clear, it's not going to work. What do you mean? I'm more than ready. I dreamt a wonderful dish. - I forgot, but... - That's not what I mean. The lights went out, but between you and I there's enough electricity. I can't do this to Toni. He's great. Frank, you can control yourself. No, I can't. Can you? What's going on? The last one? - Well, the one before the last one? - Here. Careful! Careful! Here. She's crazy. What the... Sofia! Who dares? Through summer they devote themselves to business. The three of them observe each other but none of them talks about what happened at the beach. And on September 15th, 1995, at 8 in the evening... - Why are you here so early? - I like being early. What's wrong? - It's just... I'm... - You're sweating. - I've been thinking of mum all day. - She was a bad cook. Terrible. Don't touch it. Well, remember: Once a dish is finished, it needs to be served in one minute, tops The dishes will come out as ordered. From the first to the second, no more than ten or less than eight. Is that clear? Is that clear? It is clear. Well, the costumers tonight are not average people. I picked them, they know everything about restaurants, so they'll be hard judges. But, if they're happy, it'll be the best publicity. Well, good luck and let's get to work. That boy knows it's not only his restaurant, right? Yes. Let's go, love, we're getting in the way My stomach has been upset all day. We're ?ying high. Hope we're good enough. Let's fuck all these snobs. Sofias dishes surprise the guests. A well-known businessman starts crying when he tastes a symphony of ?owers and vegetables. Are you OK? Two journalists can't stop laughing with a raw tuna fish fillet The smell of lamb with autumn fruit gives a politician the strongest erection. We passed, boys! Well, everything was perfect, really. - I'm so happy. - People left satisfied. We'll see how that works when they pay for the food. You're so handsome! Hey, good job Frank, really, perfect. Don't expect to have it fully booked tomorrow. We have 8 reservations. If we get 9 the day after tomorrow, we'll be on the right track. Is he the boss? He organizes. Sofia's the artist and your son is the manager. - So, three bosses. - There's also a god who's three. Let's drink a toast! - Here's to Sofia! - To Sofia! - Where's Sofia? - Sofia? I want to leave. - Where? - I don't know. Far away. Somewhere where we can be alone. Alone, who? - Do you have the car keys on you? - I do. Let's take the car and leave. Who are you asking? Us. Who is us? Us is the three of us. Good morning! Would you like some juice? What am I laughing at? I'm the husband. What if you were the husband? We can't break this. Let's see, what... What is "this"? The three of us? Yes. Sofia, I'm the husband! And I'm the wife, right? Would you like it if I got another woman in bed? I don't know, but that's not the question. What is the question, then? We are OK, aren't we? Can we share this, the three of us? - Sharing is doing it again? - No, no. Can you see? - What do you mean, no? Why? - Just because, I told you, - I'm the husband. - Forget your position for a second. Can we or can't we, Toni? Can we? - If we can, what, then? - Exactly. To a place that's ours alone. This is a mess. - We could hold on and see. - See what? We've been holding on for over a year. Christmas is coming, we'll have to pay I don't even dare walking by the bank. - We could lower the prices. - We're not lowering standards. Fuck it, I'd rather give the food away than having an empty restaurant. It has to work, it has to. Fucking hell. I'm not ready. I've been proud, I'm not ready. Don't dare doubting. You're great. You're the best. Well, OK. But it's not enough. It's not enough, and that's it. - We could make rations bigger. - No. People in the village say you pay a lot and get little food. We don't care about people. People are like sheep, they do as they're told. We need more advertising, some fucking lea?ets. I know: a plane! A light aircraft with a big sing saying: "The new cuisine is called Sofia". What do you think? It's great! The best idea in your life! Excuse me. There are three clients. - They're French. - OK, Elena, I'll go see. One of them says he's here to see a miracle. It's Andre! It's Andre! - That one is Andre. And the others? - One is a critic for Restaurant - Is that important? - Very important. What's the time? - Quarter to ten. - OK. - We can still save it. - What? We can make it look successful. Go out and come back as a client. Change and go with him. Ask your dad and Sofia's parents to come. - Who'll take care of the children? - They can bring them here. Come on! We need to hurry, OK? Tasting menu: 2 snacks, and two deserts, OK? Sofia, full attention, full. - OK. Shouldn't I say hello? - No, not until the miracle works. Don't kiss Sofia in front of the people. Yes, I'm sorry. - How am I? - Fine, you're fine. Sorry, I'm fucking nervous. Marc, full attention. Come on, boil the asparagus. You sell it unlabeled? How daring. Frank says you can come out. Ramon, let's get our savings - and help the children. - Are you drunk? Now it's clear to me. Your daughter is an artist. - Well, I'm leaving. - Where are you going? Stay, we can have a drink and chat. - No. - I'm so nervous. I can't sleep. - No, I'd better leave. - Why? Why better? Come I have no gas, if I'm late for the gas station... Stay the night. No, not at your place. Why not? - Why not? - Just because, Sofia. No. There are two extra rooms. It's his call. He can lend you his pajamas. Fuck off, Sofia, fuck off. Come on, take the baby inside and let's go to bed. - We'll put the children to bed. Sorry. - Here. Frank... Today you did something amazing. I swear I saw the dishes and... There were new things, things you improvised and... It's been incredible. You should have seen people's faces. You're... You're very good. Very good. Not only good, you're over anything else. Frank... ! - Stay. - Stop it. I can remember your mum: "Bravo, bravo!". Sis months later it's impossible to find a table at the restaurant. On who's name? Sofia starts cooking with absolute freedom. In a natural way she merges natural, traditional ?avors with unexpected avangarde ideas. SOFIA IS A BITCH But as her kitchen's reputation grows, so does her bedroom's. - Get out of my restaurant! - What's wrong? Out of my restaurant! Fuck off! Rumors spread and innocent people suffer. Sons of a bitch! Mum? Dad? My head aches. What's the matter, baby? He has a fever. - I'll call the doctor. - No, let's go to the hospital. - Should I take some clothes? - Yes. I'll give him a cold bath. I'll bring the car! Frank, the keys! Are you OK? Don't worry, it's all right. They though it was meningitis, but it's not. Where is he? On room 125, he'll stay until tomorrow. - Where are Mario and Jesus? - At the Kindergarten. - And him? - My ear is buzzing. - He was home. - At six in the morning? - He was sleeping. - He sometimes stays over. Come here. When is he going to have his own place? Stop it, mum! - The whole town talks about it. - They're jealous. They can't stand our success. - Don't you think of your children? - They have all the love they need. Don't they, Toni? Until they grow up and find out what's going on. Every couple is different, and you know that better than anyone. I've been through a lot for you! Through a lot! Dad... Dad, I'm sorry. I'll go smoke. You need to fix this. Frank needs to find a place and the children need to know who their father is. Understood? But it doesn't need to affect you. It's going to kill our relationship as I know it. I keep telling you there's a season for everything. - I'm not interested. - Wait. I am. - Monday is your free day. - Yes. You can always have Mondays. - I bought the hotel. - What? But... You're crazy, man! Who would buy a house when you can have a hotel? I love hotels. Is this all for us? dining room, kitchen and bar full of alcohol. You're a son of a bitch. What should I get her now? Buckingham palace? We have all we want, don't we'? You want more. No, I don't! - Promise this'll last forever. - You're being silly. You're being silly. Very silly. Tell me it'll last forever. Here. Monday is the best day of the week. A day to stay in bed. A day to sunbathe. A day to stay in bed. A day to be 20 again. A day to stay in bed. Sofia's kitchen goes sky-high The family goes on holidays. Frank doesn't He increases business. A picture! Hello, my love. - I need to pee. How's everything? - Fine, fine. Two stories, very nice place You'll go and settle things. - Perfect. Did you bring presents? - Yes. Two kimonos. I'll make martinis. - Toni... - What? It's a special day, today. - It's not a normal Monday. - Why? It's our 100th Monday. - Did you change your perfume? - Yes, it's a present. - I liked the other best. - My stomach hurts. Frank, we've been hinted we're getting a second star. It'll be on the 2001 guide. Well, Sofia is ecstatic, but you know her, she says we need to get the third one. When you're not there, her sugar level goes up, she can't stop. She smells and tastes everything... You're setting an extra place. There'll be four of us. - Four? - Four. You're dirty, man. I'm fine with that, but Sofia might not like it. Not four. Two couples. Two couples which won't mix. What? I met someone. Does Sofia know? What does Sofia have to know? What is it? You've been out for three weeks, it's been unbearable. Tell us for you too. You're very serious. What's the matter? You're wearing a new perfume. Who is that? What's going on? I'll get it. - Hello. - Hello! - Are you Sofia? - Sofia. I'm Hoshi. It means "star" in Japanese. We wanted a star, and we got one. - Pleased to meet you. - My pleasure, come on in. Thanks. - Hello. - Hello, how are you'? Toni. - Hoshi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Hello, my love. I'll go get changed. I'll make one more martini. Later... - When were you going to tell me? - So that you can get upset? No. So that you can tell me you don't love me any more. - It's not that. - It isn't. I'm 39, Sofia, 39. - And I don't have anything. - We have the same. No, you have a name, prestige, everything. You don't need me any more. I never said I don't. You're the one saying you don't need me. And you have Toni. You'll grow old together. Don't you have him? - Aren't we your family? - No, no. I'm uncle Frank, a relative. What I'm saving won't go to anyone. And you have three children. And you have one. One's yours, Frank. Don't fuck with me. - One's yours. - Which one? - Which one could be? - Alex. Alex. I don't believe it. I remember it all, you said... - I was upset with you and lied. - Why would you tell me now? Because I... Frank... If you lied about Alex, I'll kill you. You want to kill me more? What if I asked you to choose? That's not possible, Frank. I'd take Toni. Pikachu says there's a moon eclipse, you should come out. Really, she's upset, behave a little What's wrong? She told me something. What? Nothing, nothing. What? I told him Alex is his son. But he isn't. Frank, I've seen a UFO. What? Through the telescope, come with me. I'll marry her in January. You can be my best man. - Hooray for the couple! - Hooray! Fuck! It's best not to touch her. - We have to take her out! - What if she breaks? - Is she dead? - No. - Fuck, she is dead, man! - She isn't! - She's very cold. - She is in a freezer. - She's not breathing. - Let's take her to the stove. Don't just stand there, move! Careful, careful. - Bring something to cover her. - Something... Tablecloths, whatever! Her head, her head... I'll take her hands, you take her feet. If something happened to her... How could you do this to her? I don't get it. Getting married and trying to be normal? What do you mean? You've always been abnormal. Did you think we could go on like this? Look, I don't think too much. I liked fucking you both, and so did you. But you don't want to be happy, you want to be normal. - Are you OK? - Sofia! What have you done? You scared me! What have I done? Are you OK? - You almost killed yourself. - Me? I was thinking and... You can't think about us, it leads nowhere. - I wasn't thinking about us. - What, then? - The restaurant in Kyoto. - What restaurant? The kaiseki food, remember? Do you remember? We had horse sashimi. I do, honey. That cookery is over 500 years. How long are we going to live? There's no time to understand anything, nothing at all. Where are my shoes? Frank sells his part in the business and leaves for Miami to start anew. Sofia misses him, opens a new restaurant and devotes herself to searching new original dishes. Her kitchen becomes a laboratory. One night she buries a piece of meat, looking for a new texture. A year later she has insomnia for 40 days, and observes great chefs. Work is so intense and there's so little time, Sofia and Toni learn how to make love in 9 minutes. After a year they break the record and make love in 5 minutes. 11 months later, Toni goes back to 9 minutes on his own. You're offending her. Frank realizes his attempt at being normal failed. - You stay with her! - No, I want to keep both. Are you there? What are you doing? You never saw me, OK? I'm leaving. I'll sell this and leave. - You're selling the car? - Not the car, the hotel. Come on, come! - When did you arrive? - Three days ago. And you've already taken all this? You look like a skimmed milk ad. And you like Mick Jagger's mum. What are you doing? Are you going to kill me? - Get into the shower. - With you? In your dreams. - Shut up! - Let me go! Why do I never win? How could you win? You weigh 50 kilos and stink. How is she? On top of the world, right? Fuck! It's cold! You're such a sissy! Frank, we don't fuck. Are you suggesting? No, you idiot. Sofia and me don't fuck any more. You know why? - You know why? - Let me go! Sofia and you got me into this and then stepped back. I've been fighting for the three of us and you left me alone. I'm not hitting back. Listen to me. Tonight, 50 chefs are awarding her a prize to the best cook in the world. If you come near the restaurant, I'll kill you. Toni, the gun! It's not loaded! Good night. And welcome. Alex, you look handsome. Yes, really handsome. The carrot is not al dente. It's raw. It's not good. He wants to go to Rio and I want to see Las Vegas. And I want to go to the cinema, we haven't been in 40 years. We're not young any more, see? What do you mean? Did mum suspect anything? What? Ah, no, no. She thinks she's cooking for the sailing club. Careful. Everybody is here, come on. You know caramel needs to be crunchy. That's all I'm saying. - Is everything alright? - So far, so good. But it might get difficult. Eat it. Eat it. People don't come here to get stains. - It's what you asked for. - Repeat them all. Can you remember what a bad cook you mum was? Not again! I do remember, dad, I do. Do you think people wait for a year and pay the equivalent of you salary to eat this? You, here, - and precisely today. - Well... Out of the blue? Rather out of hell, just like you. - Go back there! - I don't like it. - Then don't. - I mean the way you treat people. - This is my kitchen. - Are people also yours? Not now, really. The dishes aren't fine because you aren't fine. - I'm splendid. - Yes... You're lost. Me, lost? You're looking for something which doesn't exist. What about you, Frank? What are you looking for? - Come with me. - What are you talking about? Why not? Your children have grown. Come with me. Where to, this time? Canberra. America and Europe are dead. Asia is crowded enough and Africa is a powder keg. Money is in Australia. Toni and I don't need any more money. And we don't need you, either. Are you sure? Sure. - What are you eating? - An apple. It's an onion. Fuck, Frank! You do need me. Where is he? I told you I'd kill you! You just broke my bridge! - Are you coming to Australia? - Frank! No! - Get off. - Again? Again? Stop it! Get out of my kitchen! Help me split them! When they stop, clean up the blood and tell me. I'll be smoking. Congratulations. What are the cooks here for? What do they want? It was a surprise. And this idiot screwed it up. Stop it, please, stop! Toni! I've been preparing this for over a year. They're all here. - Tell them to leave. - Why? - Because it's wrong. - What's wrong? - The food, everything is wrong. - What's wrong with the food? It's wrong, it has no soul. It's OK. Coming from you, they'll eat anything. Right? Of course. You're a genius. Fry your nails, they'll call it art. I don't want to see this food! Throw it all! Listen! We're preparing new starters, OK? Make some banana with bacon. Figs with ham. Pick them red, ripe. Asparagus with mozzarella. What else? Sardines with chocolate. You now how. - Perfect! - Shut up, you're a sufferer. You want to change the menu and there's no time. - There's no time. - Shut up you both! I can't think. Let's see... - That's it, I know. Chicken. - Chicken? Chicken. Go to the supermarket and get 24 chickens, come on. You can't give the best cooks roast chicken. Hurry up, it closes at nine thirty! Is this asshole staying? The asshole'll bring wine and entertain people, won't you? It'll be hard to keep them happy for an hour. It's easy to get cooks drunk. That's so true. I'll do my best, but 24 chicken is too much. - Tell the family to come help. - OK. Sofia... Onion? Onion. Let's go. We're making the cream. Thanks! Thanks, really! But I'm not the best cook in the world. And I'm not the best mum, nor the best daughter, nor the best wife, nor the best friend. Ina The only thing I can do is what you all do: cook. The more I cook, the more I see cooking is something big. It's so big I got lost myself and can't go back home. And suddenly Sofia gets back the four ?avors of life: Savory, acid, sweet, savory: Sweet, bitter, savory: Acid, acid, sweet, savory: Savory: Sweet, bitter, sweet. In all these years I learn something: It's OK to make mistakes, the main thing is to keep on searching. Come on, come on. I won't make it! I won't! The jacket, Alex. Son! Careful with the stew. Sofia 3 last children is about to be born. It's a woman and it's me. Think of something else. Let's breath and think of something beautiful. The sun, the beach, the sea... The sea, fine. The sea. I'll weight 3 kilos and 800 grams, and I'll be very dark. I'll have Toni's green eyes and Frank's ?eshy lips. That's it, I got it. What? I just saw the dish I've been dreaming all my life. What is it, honey? For nine months, my mum has fed me the story I just told, but I'll forget it when I'm born, H! be too busy learning how to live. I love the name my parents chose for me: It will be Monday.
