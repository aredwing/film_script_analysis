Just that... 6 people are locked in one, and in about 2 hours they're gonna die. Let me get this straight. You've got six people locked right now in a steam room? Ever sit in 130 degrees, detective? Do you know what happens to the body in about two hours? The lungs... melt. The eyes cauterize. If you wanna play Trivial Pursuit, it's on your head, Walter. All right, Pettis. Call me Jimmy. Oh, Jimmy. Listen... uh, let's take this slow, ok? Walter and I are just a couple of peons here... and we're not... uh, we're not men of great intellect... like you, and... uh, just tell us. Why are you here? According to the long count of the Mayan calender, history's gonna end in 2012, not because of spiritual enlightenment, hundreds of millions of people are gonna die, that's fact. Hundreds of millions of people will to die... uh, how? Global warming. in the middle of December. That's a fact. Three years. The midwest will be under water, swallowed by the great lakes. Maize of corn will be sold by the highest bidder. Chaos, anarchy, the de-evolution of society as we know it. All for one and not a soul for all. De-evolution, chaos, anarchy. It's gonna make New Orleans look like a candy store. Let me get this straight. You've got 6 people locked right now in a steam room, because you think the world is gonna end in 2012? My calculations are quite precise. - Global warming? - Global warming. Jimmy, the affects of global warming are projected to occur for another... In fact, detective, the affects of global warming... can be seen right now, because they're being filmed. Whoa... You... you're filming what? Who? Hold on a second, let's back up. Jimmy, I'm gonna give you what you want. Alright? You want the front page? I'm gonna give it to you, ok? Above in bold, Walter, above in bold. - Right. Absolutely. - So, we're in agreement? You got your headline. Now, here is what I want: I want the names of the hostages, right now. I wanna know where they are. I'm not naive, detective. I wanna see my headline, in big bold print. Then I'll tell you where they are. Proof. xxx Even Jesus and the Virgin Mary decided to join the party, huh? Hey, I'm Frank, how you doing? - Christopher. - Christopher? Good to meet you, brother. - I'm Grant, what's up? - I'm Christopher. - Hey, how you doing, man? - I'm Grant, good to meet you, Frank. Ooh, it's hot in here, huh? So Pettis tells me that you're, uh... drafted by the cowboys? Somebody must have turned up the steam, temperature just went up about a 100 degrees. Hi, I'm Catherine. - I'm Grant, nice to meet you. - Pleasure. - I'm Margaret. - It's a pleasure, Margaret. It's hot. - I'm Christopher. - Hi. Here we go, here we go, yeah. Yeah, come on. Ahh... Hey... Frank. I have a suggestion. Why don't we all say a few words about ourselves and get acquainted? It's a wonderful idea. But, let's do it... fast. Just a couple a sentences, nothing more. James Pettis, if you're watching this. I love you, man, you're a fucking genius. Um... I am an actress, a former actress, it... it didn't all work out the way I'd hoped. I'm from... New York, as in Manhattan. Likes... I like things dangerous... um, I like falling in love. That'd be dangerous. Dislikes? When it's over. Ok, my turn. Um... ex football player, I run a charter boat outside Detroit, I'm from Dallas, Fort Worth originally. Likes... Viagra. Dislikes... the fact I need viagra. Just keeping it real, Frank. I own an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. Is it yours, or is it just management, or? Ha... that's funny. Yeah, you're funny. Listen, anybody comes to New York, I hook you up. I got the best Italian food in all five burrows. I'm from Brooklyn. Born and bred, you know... uh, I like... chicks that know what they want, yeah. When they want it, where they want it. And then not afraid to tell you right to your face, you know? Dislikes? Nothing, I love everybody, you know what I mean, forget about it. I work... for a... a small publisher in Connecticut. I can listen you talk all day. I... I'm from San Francisco, California. Like... I like living the life of a... neurotic. Struggling. Bored at times. Introspective, sensitive. You're typically... fucked up American romance writer, who... fancies herself a poet. Dislike... Therapy twice a week. I'm a nurse. I'm from Scranton, Pensilvania. I'm sorry, I... I don't... I don't wanna ruin everybody's weekend. My... my wife. My wife died in a car accident nine months ago. I'm sorry. I didn't think it was a good idea to come. And then I tought to myself: "Why not"? Waitress, born in Atlanta, live in Detroit. Um... likes... Money, and lots of it. Dislike... It's more like hate, and really fucking hates. When a guy thinks he can grab your ass, just because he left you a 3 dollar tip. I fucking hate that. All right. Now that we're done with whole getting to know each other bullshit, I think I'm gonna enjoy a little steam. Nice. They real? Yeah, they're real. And that's as close as you'll ever fucking get. Nothing on Pettis, what about Gregory? Raymond Gregory. Mh'hm. Do me a favor, run a search on steam baths. Steam rooms, yeah. No, Grand Rapids area is good. Ok, Raymond Gregory. Uh... Professor, Curtis University, late 80s. He's got degrees up the Ying-Yang. I found a review online of... uh, one of his books, both of which are out of print, by the way. Gregory's pseudo, scientific mumbo jumbo... borders on the delusional. Review goes on to say, it's laughably, ludicruous and long-winded. Curtis canned him shortly thereafter. There's no pictures in this one? Nothing. I found this in his wallet. At least he's seeing a shrink. I wish I could afford a shrink. No surprise there. Do you think maybe he thinks, he's Gregory? Jack, I don't know what to think of this guy. Maybe he thinks he's Gregory. I'm gonna take him in. Good night. So, what'd you do at the Grand? I worked security. I worked security, back in the day. New York, 'till I went into law enforcement. Boring gig though, huh? Pays the bills, got time to study. I bet you do a lotta reading, huh? Heard about the guy called Gregory? Is he a smart guy? Raymond Gregory is a genius. What'd you think happened to him? Government ruined him. No one took his work seriously. Light years ahead of this time, light years. No, you're not wasting my time. But 6 people are locked in a steam room. And they're all going to die. I'm gonna ask you about them, so... Walter said you started some kind of online dating service. Take them to the Grand at least? Had a few laughs, hm? Did you? That's bold. Bold? It's brilliant. Web site, right? A bunch of sad and lonely people who gonna find something, love? Give 'em a dream. Hope. What's more beautiful then that? I'm pulling the no age bullshit, right? You get them all pumped up, they get lucky, right? They get laid. I gotta hand it to you, Jimmy. You're a smart guy. It's so easy. We're a nation of sheep. These sheep got any names? No. But I can tell you what's happening to them right now. All right. That does it for me. The fucking door is stuck. I'll get it. Oh god, it's hot. This is freaking me out. The fucking wood must be swollen. - It's not the wood. - So what the fuck is it? - James. - Frank, you're gonna hurt yourself. - James. - we can't do a damn thing, stop it. Open the fucking door. The lungs... melt. The eyes cauterize. - Pettis... Open the fucking door. - Frank, stop it. Frank, you're gonna hurt yourself. So what're we supposed to do then, huh? Huh? Just stay cool, and hope they come and get us? I'm fucking clostrophobic, man. I need... I need some fucking air. Some air, ok? I need some fucking fresh air. You stop that bullshit right now, you hear me? James. Pettis. Frank, you moron. What'd you fucking call me? You fucking cunt? No, no, no, come on buddy, come here. What you fucking call me? No, no buddy, come here. Stop it, everybody. Everybody please, just calm down, ok? We're supposed to have a massage in like 20 minutes, right? Cathy's got a point, dude... the dinner is next on schedule, right? Right? They're gonna come and get us for dinner. Yeah. What if no one comes down, huh? Huh? Then what? Come on in. How you been, Sam? How long you've known this guy? Jimmy worked the weekend shift. Then he just disappeared one day. Stopped showing up for work. Shit! This hotel got some kinda steam bath? Was one in the basement. Which one of you cunts is the last to touch that fucking door? It was me. I was the last one in the door. I didn't mean to do anything though, Frank. Frank. Chill out. They're gonna come down and get us for dinner. It's gonna be ok. Sorry. Yeah. They'll come and get us. - They're gonna come down, right? - It's gonna be cool. - Right? - Yeah, it's gonna be cool. Yeah, it's gonna be cool. Don't you freak out on us buddy, come on, sit down. Sit down right here with me. So, there is nothing to worry about? We are only trapped in a fucking steam room. Will you shut the fuck up. I told you I'm clostrophobic, ok? I don't give a shit what you are. Fucking bitch. I'm a bitch? Am I bitch? Look at you. You're a fucking pussy. I'm a bitch? Jessie, stop. We're not trapped, all right Frank? Funny how everything was cool until you bitches came in. Go fuck yourself! Jessie, stop! I think that's enough, dude. Back the fuck up, bro. Or what, Frank? I'm warning you, buddy. What the fuck are you gonna do about it, huh? Frank. You're gonna fucking stop me, motherfucker, huh? Huh? Motherfucker! We're freaked out here, ok? Stop. You fucking bitch. You are fucking disgusting. You actually like this guy? He's a fucking looser. I think you're full of shit. Fucking pussies like you don't play football. Frank! You don't have to do this, Frank. You just... keep it together, pull it together, Frank. Pull it together, everybody, everybody. Everybody. Fuck you all. Pettis! Was? What'd you mean was? They destroyed it 3 months ago. They're building some kinda underground parking ramp... down there or something. The hotel's under renovation. Ain't nothing left. They're turning it into condos. I never said it was the Grand. I'm sorry to bother you. See you. Frank. Please stop, please! Frank, what're you doing? Frank! Frank! Shut up! Getting in a trap, Frank. Frank, stop. You're dead. Come here. Get off off me! Frank, stop it! No! Fucking bitch, you fucking bitch! You're gonna die! One down, detective. Yeah, this is a message for Dr. Alexander Adams. This is detective Jack Mancini, Grand Rapids Police Department. I'm holding one of your patient sir, Mr. James Pettis. Would you call me back as soon as possible, sir? I'm at 555-0221. Alright, as soon as you can, sir, thank you. You've been searching through my wallet, detective. So you tell your shrink? About your experiment? Why'd you call him and ask him? Oh, wait. You already did. It's funny how most perps sell their mother before they fess up to a crime. Here you're walking in a newspaper office, yacking you're holding 6 people hostage. Let's say you get your headline, you know what you're looking at? Six people hostage in a steam room? They'll lock you up, pal. Throw away the key. - It's not about me, detective. - Oh, I know. It's all about the global warming in fact. Saving the world. Yeah, Mancini. Hey, glad you called, I was waiting. I'm gonna be there in an hour. God help me. You underestimate the situation, detective. - Why, what you smiling about? - The biggest case in your life, and you wanna meet a girl in a bar in an hour. I don't underestimate the situation whatsoever. Pathetic. Listen man, you're holding you're going to jail, for the rest of your life. If not, they'll give you the luny bin. Me? Yeah, I got my late night rendezvous here. Biggest blue eyes you ever saw. Who's pathetic now, chump? Who is pathetic now? Why'd you get him? He says, he locked 6 people in a steam room. Because of global warming. Says, the end of the world is coming. Well. that's what we need. Another nutjob walking the streets. - At least he's original. - Hm'hm. I put a call into the shrink. Something about the way he describes the hostages, it's too precise. There's too many details. Jack. This guy looks like a nut case. I'll give you do what you can than we cut him loose. I got a burglary down on Fletcher, I need you out there. It's my night off. Yeah, well, you're here now. Hey, Jack. I called every hotel in Grand Rapids... with a steam room. No hostages. - There's no health clubs? - All closed. Closed? Call the security companies down. Check every one alarm. Call every internet dating service in Michigan. Lonely, Sir? Yeah. Cross reference it with his name, Pettis. James Pettis. James Pe... Is that two t's? Two t's. Make it snappy. Only speed I know. Where have you been in the last 3 months? European vacation. Have you ever been to Italy, detective? Of course you have. Weather is lovely this time of year. Now you listen to me, asshole. You're wasting my fucking time now. You're either give me the full names of the hostages, or I'm gonna rip 'em outta your fucking head. One by fucking one. Is that how they do it in New York? Intimidate? To get a confession? You're pathetic, detective. You could've been retired by now, so you do this for fun? What else you do? Chasing middle-age fluzies around crap-ass bars? Blinding them with vodka, and lies, telling them how good they look for over 50? Oh, detective. No. No. I see right through you, detective. You do not have the intellectual capacity for this case. You should go. Let's talk about you. Who the fuck are you, hm? Jimmy Pettis, yeah? What kinda life you're trying to keep your wit on? - Your vulgarity is pathetic. - What kinda a life, huh? - My vulgarity? - It annoys me. Your pinky ring, and cheap cologne. and your cheap suit. Hm? What'd you say about my suit? You wanna play bad cop, huh? - What did you say about my suit? - Ok, ok. Let's play bad cop. Ok. Ok, let's play bad cop. We're gonna get Walter, before somebody else dies. Catherine? Catherine? I don't wanna stay here anymore. I wanna get out of here. Get out of here. We're trapped. We're trapped. Somebody has locked us in here. What now? It is that sick fuck locked us in on purpose. Give me break. An online dating service gives away 5000 dollars. We're trapped. It was weird from the get go. Come on! Pettis knew what he was doing. I don't have anyone. I don't have anyone who's gonna look for me. Do you? What about you, Catherine? Is anyone coming for you? No, Jessie. Nobody is coming for me either. Grant! Grant! Grant, I'm talking to you. Grant! Grant! You. No one is gonna be looking for me. My whole life, not even my parents. But if I focus on that, I will lose my mind. So, what I'm gonna focus on... is getting us outta here. So you shot your mouth. Your big mouth has caused us a big problem. You onyl open you mouth to breathe, do you understand? Do you understand me? Do you understand me? Now. There is a logical explanation for everything. Only thing that's going wrong, is the door got jammed. Alright, nobody locked us in here, the door jammed people, right? Right, Christopher? And that son of a bitch. That son of a bitch lost his mind. That's all what's going wrong, right? Grant? What, Catherine? There's a crack in the window. Christopher. Help us, help us. Christopher, do something. Help. Help us. Pettis! Please. Ok, one of you girls, stick your head out... to see what's blocking the door. - I'll do it. - Good girl. Ok, now lie down with your face first, I'll lift you up, ok? - Ready? - Don't drop me. - Don't drop me! - Make sure you got her. - You got her? - I got her. - Here we go. - Is she ok? - Let me up, let me up. - Watch the glass. Ok. I don't see anything, nothing's blocking the door. There's something blocking it. There's nothing blocking the door. I see the pipe. Pettis! - Jessie, what's happening? - Pettis! - We got her. - Pettis!... Pettis!... The lights went out, I can't see anything. What'd you mean the lights went out? The lights. I can't see! I can't see! Help! Someone's here. Help us. - Someone is coming. - Jessie, what's happening? Help us, we're locked in the steam room. Help. Thank you, thank you. What happened? - Do you have her? - Yes, yes. I got her. Don't twist her. Don't twist her. It's ok, Jessie. It's ok. We got you. We got you. We got you. OK. OK. Roll her over here, don't twist her. Oh, my god! What is that! Oh, my god. My god. Dating services with internet addresses in Michigan. Nothing with the name Pettis. You check the ones giving away cash prizes? Free weekends at these hotels. All of them have give aways, detective. That's how they get people to sign up and pay. The only Turkish bath I found was at the Grand Hotel. But here is something. I can't find anything... on James Pettis in the state of Michigan. No driver's licence. His social security doesn't match. What'd you mean it doesn't match? His W-4 at the hotel. Pettis used a fake number. I take it back. It's a real number, it just belongs to someone in Florida who died 30 years ago. Tell Clark I'm gonna book him on suspicion of homicide. I'll run his prints. XXX Let's go back to where we left off. Jessie dies. Were you having any trouble following the story, detective? No, I follow the story. One thing I can't see here though. Jessie's killed by a guy with a nail gun, right? Ok, so who killed her? You? Because Jessie was supposed to have died by a natural human reaction. A reaction that is global warming, right? So that doesn't add up. Which show that your plan Jimmy, in of itself is fucked up. You know, the mother of all experiments, is not airtight, you know, It's not tight. All this shit about "I gotta talk to Walter, I wanna be on the front page now, "I wanna set everyone free". is all shit, cause it's not happening now. It never was happening now. And if it was happening now, how the fuck did you know? How the fuck did you now... Jessie got hit with a fucking nail gun, Jimmy? How? I don't know. You don't know? I'm fucking all over you. You lock 6 people in a steam room? Yeah, before the construction began at the Grand Hotel. And they're dead in there, for months Jimmy. They're dead. Now look at me when I'm talking to you. Where're the bodies? Where're the bodies? Fuck it. Is there a possibility here, none of this ever happened? You're not even Jimmy Pettis. You're just a whacko. Who are you? Are you Raymond Gregory? You're... uh, delusional, you understand that? Jimmy, all this convoluted, concocted theory... about global warming, man. Give it a rest. It's over. It's over. Your life's work... was pissed upon, man, it's been trashed. Your existence, it was rendered, a fucking lie. A lie. You kill six people? You don't qualify. You do it in your imagination. Either I killed them months ago detective, or I'm insane and... I made it all up, make up your mind. I mean, when I said earlier... that you're not qualified to... handle this case, I made a mistake, that was a gross understatement. It pees me to see you all excited to find out who may have killed Jessie. And maybe I have an accomplice, maybe I don't. It pees me even more that you can't keep your pee-head on... the bigger picture, there is a bigger picture here. I mean, I'm only continuing with the experiment... to prove what happens to people... during the chaos, because of the heat. The lifes of these hostages are of no value. You have a job, that is your bigger picture... To get Walter to put my story in the paper. And, I'll level with you, this.. You've gotta do better than this... fake social security. Oh, you're gonna level with me? Then I'm gonna level with you. I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told you in Walter's office. You give me the full names and locations of these hostages, ok? Then you get your 15 minutes of fame. You don't give me the proof. You don't get your headline. I really don't give a fuck. I really don't. About global warming. Greenhouse gas. Jack, I gotta talk to you. The psychiatrist called, and he sent this over. In the last 6 months professor Raymond Gregory... has confessed to his psychiatrist... every major assassination in the United States. He played you, Jack. He escaped from the mental ward at state hospital. So he's professor Raymond Gregory. - I surmised that. - Oh. Well, they're sending somebody to pick him up. So what does it prove? It proves he's a nutcase, that's all it proves. He still could be holding people hostage, he still could've killed them. He's too precise, I told you that. He knows every detail of how these people died. Jack! The fucking guy's a frootloop. So, what if he's a frootloop. Give me 30 minutes, I'll crack him. Jack, I talked to his psychiatrist, he's schizophrenic and he's highly delusional. You understand that? You got it? It's over. Now, get your ass over to Fletcher street. Your shrink called. Sent the paperwork. Says you confessed already, about killing JFK, hm? You killed John Lennon? Did you try to shoot the Pope in Rome, Jimmy? This case is closed. I gotta run. It's back to the luny bin, pal. Call me crazy if it makes you feel better. I'm always gonna miss you. You have a nice life, hm? I'll tell you where the bodies are. What is happening? Oh, God! Margaret was... she was unstable anyway. But you see detective, millions of people will follow... her direction. That's why the experiment is so valuable. Many, many will kill themselves... rather then to face man's inhumanity to man. When the time comes, on that faithful day. What happened to you, Raymond? What possessed you to become Jimmy? The teaching was the greatest joy in my life, to fill a young mind with... principles, ideas. The excitement of... of the... purity... of... the potential, of facing... the new world a better world than that we live in now. My father was so proud. I was top in my class, and he... he... But was sensitive, sensitive. He was sensitive and he knew that... once my theories became... clearer, and the radical clarity that was my... fate... to... expound, he... had to take the derision... the humiliation, I lived with. But... but, my father, it killed him. They killed him. And they killed Raymond Gregory. Mh'hm... I could still save the world, detective. What's taking that ambulance so long? Yes. You'll see. You... uh, you wanna tell me, hm? About what happened to the last three? Look at me. Look at me. Why... would somebody do this? My mama died when I was She was singing... and then she hit the floor. That was the last day I ever saw my daddy sober. Look at me, Catherine. Look at me. Look at me. Christopher, hold me. What're you laughing at, Grant? Me? Laughing at a joke, Christopher. I know why I'm gonna die, Pettis. Good old karma. The only thing I'm worried about this joke might be on me. Might be on me. I think there's a joke going on, Christopher. And I think you're telling it. I think maybe she's helping you tell it, Christopher. They say, I ran a red light. Bam! Hey, that's like a fraight train. Two of those boys. They died. It's not over, Grant. We can still make it. You are so stupid. We are still alive. You keep telling yourself that. You are so full of shit. Wait a minute. He can see us, and he can hear us. Doesn't that mean that there's a camera in here? Somewhere? If he can see us, where is the camera? Pettis! Is your buddy down here? Your old buddy Christopher. And his girlfriend Catherine. Huh? How long you guys known each other? You and Catherine? You didn't just meet here, did you? I don't think so, buddy. Five minutes ago she says there might be a camera in here. It's gotta be somewhere, where they put the camera. And then... Ah, you found a camera in here. I've got something. Coincidence? - Give me something. - What is it? I don't know. Grant, give me something heavy! Give me something. Help me up. Give me! - Give it. - Here. There's something there. What is it? What is it? James, open the door. Look what you've done! Look what you've done! My God!... Stop, make it stop! Stop. Stop. Stop. Make it stop! I came here to start a new life! I'm not buying it. I'm just not buying it. Stop! Son of a bitch! Be careful. I feel cool here. There's gotta be another room in there. What is it? Nothing. Catherine, Catherine. Look at me. What you wanna do? Put my hand in that hole in the wall, huh? Like we put Jessie's head through the hole in the door? Three nails in her head, buddy, yeah, three nails in her head. Boom, boom, boom... Oh yeah, that's funny. What's next? You want me to put my hand in the little hole? My hand in that hole, will be... kaboom... gonna chop my hand off, is that it? Is that it? I like my hands, Christopher. I like both of them. Yeah. I've been watching you boy, I've been watching you. You know what I think? I think you're a nasty, nasty little man. That's what I think. I think you're a nasty little man, and I think you're friends with Pettis. Is your buddy down here? Your old buddy, Christopher? And his girlfriend Catherine? How long you've known Pettis, Christopher? Make me to laugh at this joke you guys have going on. What's happening, boy? What's going on, Christopher? That's it. That's it? What's it, boy? I've had enough. You've had enough? Of you! I've done nothing but trying to keep you calm, give you a chance to get out of here. Do you wanna lose your mind? Do you wanna end up like them? That's what you're aiming for me to be, like them? I don't care about your story, Grant. You're pathetic. I don't care if you fry in here. Who's pathetic now, Christopher? Pettis! I'm coming for your woman. You're gonna talk, bitch, you're gonna talk. No! No! No! - Talk to me! - Christopher. - Will you talk to me? - Help me! - Will you talk to me? - Help me, Chris... You're the strongest. Animal instinct, detective. Only the strong survive. My experiment happened exactly the way I predicted it. Some will kill themselves, some will kill, some will go insane. It's genetic. The faultier rudeness lies not... in our stars but in ourselves. I'm gonna try to see you get the help you need, Raymond. You have to call Walter. Yes, call Walter. Call Walter, call Walter. Call him, call Walter. - It's time, Jack. - Dr. Adams sends his apologies. There is an emegency on one of the wards tonight. Yeah, no problem. I hope he didn't give you too much trouble. No, he is not bad. Just a little agitated. Got a hell of a twitch, huh? He needs his medication. How long you've been treating him? He turned himself over as a ward of state about 4 months ago. Dr. Adams has been treating him aggressively ever since. It's hard to say, he's had a lot of episodes lately. When did he disappear? Yesterday. And who... uh. you reported him missing? We always wait 24 hours, sir. Hospital policy. Can't say there's another bit of imagination, huh? I can take him now, unless of course, you wanna keep him for tonight. No, no. Thanks. I'm gone. Thank you for your help. Yeah, good luck. Be careful. Hey. No, I'm on the way now. What're you wearing? Huh? Come on. No, why? Oh, nothing. Just something come up. His vital signs are stable, Dr. Adams. Thank you, that'll be all. I'm quite upset with you, Raymond. Going to the press, that was... not part of our arrangement. I'm sorry. That's ok. Everything is fine now. You're a genius. Living and touching real human chaos. It was the greatest experience of my life. It was beautiful. You get some sleep. You don't control him anymore. He controls you. Kill him... and come home. I love you.
