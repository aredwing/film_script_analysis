Why the plinth? To let the stalls see the feet. Why the hat? To help hide the face. Why the gown? To have him all black. What has he on underneath? Say it. His night attire. - Colour? - Ash. Light. How's the skull? - Youve seen it. - I forget. - Say it. - Moulting. A few tufts. - Colour? - Ash. - Why hands in pockets? - To help have him all black. - They mustn't. - I make a note. Hands exposed. How are they? The hands, how are the hands? - You've seen them. - I forget. Crippled. Fibrous degeneration. - Clawlike? - lf you like. - Two claws? - Unless he clench his fists. - He mustn't. - I make a note. Hands limp. Light. Good. Now let's have a look. Come on. Lose that gown. Step on it, I have a caucus. Like him better without? - Hes shivering. - Not all that. Hat. Like that cranium? Needs whitening. I make a note. Whiten cranium. The hands. The fists. Come on. And whiten. I make a note. Whiten hands. Something wrong. What is it? What if we were ... were to... ... point the finger? No harm trying. Higher. A touch more. Stop! Better. It's coming. He's shivering. Bless his heart. What about a little... a little... gag? For God's sake! This craze for explicitation! Every i dotted to death! Little gag! For God's sake! Sure he won't utter? Not a squeak. Just time. Ill see how it looks like from the back. I can't see the toes. I'm standing in the back row of the stalls and can't see the toes. I make a note. Tilt pedestal. There's a trace of face. I make a note. Down his head. Come on. Down the head. A shade more. Stop! Fine. lt's coming. Could do with more nudity. I make a note. Oh, come on! Come on! Bare the neck. The legs. The shins. The other. Higher. The knees. And whiten. I make a note. Whiten all flesh. It's coming. Is Luke around? Luke! Luke! What's the trouble now? Luke's around. Blackout stage. What? Just the head. What? Lovely. What if he were to... were to... raise his head... an instant... show his face... just an instant. Raise his head! What next? Where do you think we are? In Patagonia? Raise his head? For God's sake! Now. There's our catastrophe. In the bag. Once more and I'm off. Once more and he's off. Stop! Now... let em have it. Terrific! Hell have them on their feet. I can hear it from here.
