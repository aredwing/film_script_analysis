The 36 are amongst us all. Anyone you meet could be one of them. The world exists in the merit of these 36 righteous people. Without them, the world we know would fall into chaos. Corruption. And eventually darkness. To achieve this darkness, there are those too who have Chosen evil over good. They are united by their leader, Lilith, and are all Marked by the symbol of darkness. Once their mission on this earth is completed, they are Destroyed, either by self-infliction, or by another Dark one. Damnation falls on the ones who do not choose to be evil And want to escape the wrath of Lilith. Lilith's ultimate revenge is to destroy the 36 by choosing The same fate that their namesakes have been Immortalized. The final nine have been discovered. By abolishing them, darkness will reign over light. Hey father, can you save me? Hey father! Agh! 28, Stephen. Thank you. Oh, damn it! Oh my God! Somebody help me! No, no! And cut! Great job.

Great job. Um, I can walk myself down. You sure? Yeah, no, it's fine. Alright, I'll see you tomorrow? See you, yeah. Don't get killed! Alright you two. We've got a dead priest in the subway tunnel on 189th and Broadway. Woah. A father Esteban Lopez from St. Lazarus in the heights. Father Esteban? Ain't that your family's parish? Yeah. Surprised your mother ain't called you. Yeah, well, a lot of other people have. Somebody apparently broke into the church, destroyed the Virgin Mary and cut off baby Jesus' head. They also stole some books from the library. Listen. Captain wants you two over there as soon as possible, Alright? 'Cause he wants to make sure that there's no connection Between the death of the priest and the destruction Over at the church. Detectives Byrnes and Rosen are covering the murder scene. How'd he die? A rock to the head. Damn. Yeah. Man... It's Halloween. Yeah, hi mom. Yeah. I just heard. Yes, mother. It's a shame. Yeah, me an Michael are going to investigate right now. Hello? Hello? Heh. Hello? Dominic! Eve, please let me suck the blood! Joan, I know that's you. Happy Halloween! I swear babe, I had nothing to do with this. I know, I know, baby. You would never do anything this scary. Oh, girl, they let you keep all these shoes? Yep. Ooh, you know we wear the same size. Then you can keep them because they've been killing. I thought we'd all go dancing for a little bit tonight. You know, thought it'd be fun. I thought we were going to plan for the memorial. We'll do it, Eve. But it's Halloween. And we keep putting it off, which keeps making it worse. It's our responsibility to carry on their names. Eve, I know, but... Life had other plans for them. Aw, leave him alone. He's too busy being a club promoter to be thinking about Others. Okay, okay. Enough with the guilt trip already. I'm just saying we're alive and they're not. That's, that's all. It's Halloween. I know you understand what she was saying, Dom. But okay, just give me a minute to get dressed. It is Halloween. But tomorrow we'll start working on the memorial Planning, okay? Deal. Deal. Alright. Perfect. Feel that? It's freezing in here. Brings back memories, huh? Yeah. Hey Joe. It may be Halloween, but this don't feel like kids to me. It's obviously someone who has issues with God. Yeah. Doesn't everybody? Oh, father. Hard to believe you were once an altar boy at this church. Do you know what the beheading of the baby Jesus and the Desecration of the virgin Mary means? The Bible says that when the desecration of idols starts... The righteous shall be killed. And that the end of our days are near. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry father. But the things you're saying are making me nervous. My partner Michael. We've met. The neighborhood. Excuse me. Montoya. Yeah. Yeah, we're here. Right. So how you been, father? Not bad, for an old fool. I'm sorry about father Esteban. He was a good man. Like you. Special. Como esta Tu mama? She's fine, thank you. Give her my best. I will, father. Joe. Yeah? We gotta go.

He's just a kid. What the hell are we dealing with here? Jesus Ochoa. He's from the neighborhood. He's a freshman over in Washington heights. Did you get an address to the family yet? No, we're working on it. I'll be outside. Yes, can I help you? Are you senora Ochoa? Yes, I'm Tilda Ochoa. Oh my God. My Jesus is not home yet. Did something happen to him? I'm sorry senora. No! Jesus! Jesus! No, God! Hijo mio... Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai. Here you go. That was my Jesus. The group honored him as one of the righteous of tomorrow. He was such as special boy. Senora, do you mind? And these other kids? Yeah, they're a wonderful group of kids from the academy Of royals. They're the six that escaped that horrible plane crash Last year. In Montreal? Yes. God bless them. You know father Judas is the only survivor from that Plane crash. He was the one who introduced my Jesus to the group. Senora, do you mind if I take this picture? I'll make sure they return it to you once we're done. They're a wonderful group of kids. Just like my Jesus. He was so happy to be part of that. So, what I'm curious to know is how many of you actually Believe in such a thing as spirits. Mr. Savio. Hm? Stop. Stop it. Mr. Savio. Ugh, hmm? Mm, sir. Yes, Professor Okafor. The answer is yes? Yes, uh... I mean, I don't... And you mean you were asleep. No. Then answer the question. Do you believe in spirits, Mr. Savio? Uh... Well, I-i guess so. Really. So you believe there's spirits all around us? I do, Professor Okafor. I, I think that, uh, there are spirits throughout the world, And they give comfort to those that believe in them. Have you ever been comforted by a spirit, Mr. Savio? No. I've been comforted by some ghouls, but, the right spirit Hasn't comforted my life as of yet. Alright, alright. Your papers on the garden of Eden are due next Monday, people. And let's not use this weekend of partying and spirits as an Excuse for not turning them in on time. Especially you, Mr. Savio. Class dismissed. And are they tardy, I'll ask for another one. Oof. Hey. I overslept. At what precinct? Very funny. Thank you. Eating in the library? Hey! Hi Ms. El. Welcome back, Ms. El. Thank you. Donut? Oh, no thanks. I really shouldn't, but if you insist. How was your trip? Oh, it was just beautiful. Jerusalem, Nazareth, floating in the dead sea. Oh, Israel is truly God's country. Wow. I hear that from everyone. How's the movie going? Oh, it's been fun, thanks. What are you guys working on now? We're trying to organize a memorial for the group that Died last year. Oh my. Has it been a year already? Yeah. Hmm. Any ideas yet? We want to have something that's kind of fun, but we Still want to get out our message across to the world That we care, that we haven't forgotten, and that we're Still actively involved in helping the less fortunate. What about that club you all like to go to? The deity? The deity! Why don't you organize an event there? That's actually not a bad idea. It's a great idea, but what would we base the memorial on? Hmm. Well, it is all saints day today. And with this month being the time to... Honor the memory of lost souls. Maybe you can throw an event around that same theme? Yeah, but the anniversary of the crash is tomorrow, and how Can we do something so quick? Well, if we all met up at the club tonight, we could talk to Genesius. I mean, if anyone can make it happen, she can. Okay. Sounds good. I mean, this could really work. Thanks Ms. El, you're the best. Oh, oh. Let me help you with that. Hold on, hold on. Hey, the alphabet... Of Ben Sira. Oh, Ms. El. Great to have you back. Oh, it's great to be back. You guys are the ones who are truly something. Don't eat in the library. Oh. What? Hey! What?

You don't need me in there, right? Mm, nah. I got this. I've been waiting for you. Jesus Ochoa was a good boy. He reminded me so much of you when you were young. How's his mother doing? I guess she's good as she can be. I shall pray for her. Father, I have some other questions. Do you know these other kids? Lamed Vovniks. In every generation, there are 36 individuals chosen by God, Joseph. Chosen, not of their own choice. They are like the rest of us. Father, I don't even understand what you're talking about.

Everyone thought he was crazy. Did you think he was? I don't know. And what else did he say, Joseph? He wanted me to read this verse in the Bible. And then he said that I was... One of the ones. Joseph, you are the gifted one. Look deep. Seek and you shall find. You find out anything in there? Guess not. Do you even understand what you're reading in that thing.

Just keep reading, come on! "And martens meet with jackals, and a wood-devil runs" Upon his fellow. Yea, Lilith dwells there and finds rest for herself.

According to the alphabet of Ben Sira. Ben Sira? Lilith, not Eve, was the real first wife of Adam. She was created at the same time and from the same earth As him. After she refused to become subservient to him, Lilith Left the garden of Eden and set out on a path of Destruction and chaos, killing anyone or anything that got in Her way. Lilith is commonly referred to in ancient mythology as the Female demon who is portrayed as the foe of Eve. You scared me. Uh, we were just looking at some very interesting stuff on The Internet.
