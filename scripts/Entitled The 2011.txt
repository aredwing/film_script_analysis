See, l'm nothing special. l'm like everybody else-- getting by day by day, week by week, dreaming about that one thing that'll make everything all right. That one thing. JD Couriers. May l have your account number, please? - Another one? - Yep. Why are you bothering, kid? You got a job for life here. Yeah. Well, it's all here. You've got everything we're looking for. Great. Thank you. We should be able to let you know sometime next week, so-- Can l ask you a question, sir? l'm not gonna get this job, am l? - l really need this job. - l'm sorry.

Yeah. l'm done. Yeah, l had dreams, but they're over... because one day you just gotta wake up. - You just gotta wake up. - Hi, Paul. - Hi, Mom. - How are ya? - Pretty good. How was your day? Oh, you know-- same old, same old. lt'll come good. l graduated two years ago. l'm still living with my parents. Well, do you hear us complaining? Oh, l made you some sandwiches. You know, just to keep that guilt thing going. - Where's Dad? - Working late. You know, you're pretty late yourself. l guess if l keep on studying, l can trick myself into believing l'm getting somewhere. - Why haven't you filled these? - l'll get around to it. Ma, you need to take your medication. They don't come free, Paul. lt's already wiped us out. Don't worry. l'll get better. But in the end it wasn't about me. lt wasn't about me at all. l'll get by. lt was about seeing pain and struggle and knowing there was not one thing you could do about it. But not anymore. Not anymore. Hey, bro. - Hey, how are you doing, man? Have you ever done it in a canoe before? l thought a civilian snuck in. You got a paddle? Come on, take a risk for once.

Ma? No no, see, th-they can't. They can't just do this. Paul... l'm so afraid. Oh, Mom. lt's okay. l'm so sorry. l'll take care of this, okay? A few days, the world's gonna know who you are, Dean. You ever think about that? l have, yeah. l can't do this on my own, Dean. And we are all on our own. Not anymore. Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-- Maybe she's right about you. l thought she was just falling for your blue eyes. Listen, if you guys have a thing going on, - l don't want to get in the way. - We're just friends. That's it. You haven't called her or anything, have you? No, l haven't called her. Why would l-- l lost my cell anyway. Go figure. Yeah. Why don't you go grab me a beer? Yeah. So tell me, is that just a word? l gotta do something with my Friday nights, huh? Okay, so that's two tickets to Guadalajara this Saturday the 27th. That's it. You're all set. Anything else l can help you with, sir? No, l've got everything l need. Thank you. Sorry. l would have called, but-- No, l know-- no communication, no trace. lt's safer that way until it goes down, right? You mean-- Yeah. When?

Aren't we getting a little old for these family vacations? l mean, being out in the middle of nowhere is fine when you're 1 2, but the novelty's kind of wearing off.

Where's your boat? l didn't see the boat. Hey, Avis, this is great. l couldn't have done it without Frank. - Uh-- - Frank, look at you. - You missed your calling. - No, l'm very happy behind the wheel.

Just please don't-- don't hurt her. Please don't hurt her. Answer me! Please just-- Where the hell is Bob? He's probably checking the tax on his grocery bill. That's why he's worth 10 times more than us put together, right? Except when it comes to Jeff. Oh, Jeff, yeah right. Now what do you suppose he got him for graduation? Probably socks from Switzerland. - And aftershave. - From Paris! That better not be him. Hey, why don't you ditch the suit? Freshen up. Are you hitting on me? Hello. - Mr. Jones? - Yes? - Mr. Clifford Jones? - Yeah. - You have a daughter named Hailey? - Yes. - That's right. - No, actually that's wrong. l have her. l've also got Bob and Slick's boys. - You want to talk to them? - What is it? Fuck. - Don't fucking touch her! - Tell us what you fucking want! Don't fucking touch her. Don't touch her. - Just talk to us. Leave her alone. - Fuck. Tell us! All right. So this is what's gonna happen-- What the hell's going on? lf you so much as touch a hair on my daughter's-- Why don't you cut the ''if you touch her, l'm gonna kill you'' fucking shtick, you jackass, okay? l'm gonna tell you what to do, you're gonna do it and that's gonna be it. lt's as simple as that, okay? Do you understand? Okay. Great. l want a million dollars from each and every one of you. That's $3 million. l want you to call your lawyers and begin the bank arrangements. There's gonna be no drop offs, no suitcases full of money, this is it. l will call you in half an hour with the bank accounts. Do you have any questions? l said any questions? - No. - And if you decide to call the police, go right ahead. All they're gonna do is clutter up your house and delay our business. And in that case... save your money. l'll say goodbye to your kids for you. Were they scared? - Yeah. - Fucking pussies. l love it. The one who was driving makes me want to puke. lt'll all be over in a couple of hours. Well, l mean, it won't all be over. Will it? No, it won't. Fuck! Voicemail again. The one time we need him. - Let's call the police. - Okay, we call the police, does that increase the chance of catching this psycho? Yeah, it does. Does it also increase the chance of something happening to our kids? Yeah, it does and l don't like those odds. - This is not a business deal. - That's exactly what this is! This is a business deal and l'm doing risk assessment. l'm not risking Nick's life because you want to do what you think is the right-- Okay, then let's get out there and do something to try and find them. Well, Cliff, where do we start? We're gone and the guy calls, then what? All right. - We've gotta wait for Bob. - Bob's not here. Look, we don't have time to make a debate about this. All right, we need to stick together. We can't afford to antagonize this guy. All right, let's just do what he says. Here. Call your guy. l'm going back downstairs. Dean, you've got to stay up here. No more than two people down there. You know the rules. Somebody has to be up here to keep watch. Yeah, so she can do it. She can stay then. No, Dean, l need you for the big stuff. Okay? - Got it? - Yeah. - Everybody happy? - Fuck you! Oh yeah? Why don't l just fuck you? - What the fuck? - Hmm?

There's something you should know. Bob Vincent hasn't arrived yet. - Where is he? - He's late. - He's late?! - What's going on? lt doesn't mean anything. He'll be here any minute.

Get the fuck out of here. - No! - Jeff! You fucking bitch! Fucking bitch! You fucking bitch! - Listen to me... - Dad! ...that shouldn't have happened, okay? But if you don't want anything like that to happen again, - you'd better fucking listen to me. - What the hell have you done? - You killed an innocent boy? - Just listen to me!

Are they giving you trouble? l guess it's not every day that they're asked to transfer a million bucks. He called you Slick. - What? - The first time he phoned he called you Slick. Are you sure? l haven't called you that since college. You're the only one who ever did. What's going on, Rick? lf there's anything else you need, l can-- ls something wrong? Are you gonna stick to the goddamn plan from now on? - What's the big deal? - The big deal is you just fucking killed somebody. - ls that an everyday occurrence for you? - He deserved it, didn't he? Anyway you're the one who's been telling me for months how we're gonna fuck them over. Right? Stick it to them, destroy their perfect fucking little lives. l thought you'd be-- l thought that's what you fucking wanted. lt's not. l'm sorry, okay? l just want to make you happy.

You know, why did she get to do that? - Don't worry, you'll get your turn. - Yeah, l'd better. l didn't come out here to just channel surf. - l know. - Good. This place is covered in our prints. Fibers and all that shit-- you know that too? That's why we're gonna burn it down after we're done. You got it all figured out, don't you? Dean... what's your problem? l'm looking at it. How's that? - You just don't add up. - Meaning? Well, you say you want to fuck them, but really you want to be them. - Really? - Yeah. - ls that it? - No. No, this is just your little shortcut into the club, isn't it? - lsn't it?! - Oh yeah. You're right, Dean, except for one little thing. There isn't going to be a club left, is there? Oh God, Nick! Shh shh shh! lt's okay. - We're going to be okay. Okay?

Well, not tonight you don't. Sit still. There's a new show in town tonight, one night only. What are you talking about? My boyfriend's a really clever guy. - Mmm. - Mm-hmm. He planned the whole thing. But he's a bit predictable. So we thought: what's the best way to end any show? Hmm? Well, it's obvious, isn't it? With a bang. - What what? - But don't worry, it's not for you. lt's for the folks back at home. See, 3:00 a.m. they'll be sitting there, thinking they've done their duty, and l guess you can say we'll blow the fucking roof off. Hey, have you ever opened up a modem before? - What? - There's nothing there. Just a circuit board and a lot of empty space. You really can put anything in there. Anything. And if it's attached to a laptop and it's programmed to detonate like your daddy's is, well, 3:00 a.m. No. Oh Jesus. Oh man. How long is this gonna take? - Cliff, just take it easy, okay? - How the hell do you remain so calm? Because us panicking isn't going to help our kids. All right? We'll get them home.

All right? lt'll teach them a lesson. You know how they are. Yeah. You're right. Champagne? Cheers. Jesus, l can't believe it. Her father's place is the only place within miles. There's only two ways to get there-- they can take the road. Nobody's gonna be around this time of night so they're gonna take the forest. Stay together, go due north. l've gotta stay here and wait for the money. They may just hole up somewhere till daylight. That's fine. As long as they're not there to stop it, l don't give a fuck. - They're not gonna wait till daylight. - Why not? - 'Cause l told them about our surprise. - You what?! - Why would you do that? - You fucking dumbass! - l don't know.

There's no point in going. - Why'd you do that? - l don't know. - What's the fucking point?! - The point is you have a chance to change something, okay? You have a chance to convince the world you're not the same fucking loser you've been every other goddamn day of your fucked-up life. Okay? That's the point! You know what? l'm getting kinda tired of this place anyway. Dean, l want them back alive. Hey. Go. Fuck. Are you sure we're going in the right direction? Yeah, l'm sure. Nick! Nick! Okay okay, we'll stop just for a sec. - We're never gonna make it. - We still have three hours.

You're kidding me. What are you gonna do? Fuck. Fuck. - How much? - $750,000. What? Oh, come on. - Don't hold out on me, Cliff. - That's a hell of a lot of money. - For Nick's life? - No, of course not. Not for Nick's life. l haven't got it. What? You think l'm lying to you? This is our kids' lives we're talking about-- - Exactly. - You think l'm lying to you? Okay, what the fuck is going on? Tell me. The kids have been abducted.

There's no help, Hailey, okay? lt's the middle of the night and we're in the middle of nowhere. Now let's go. Come on. Come on. Stop! Stop acting like you're in charge. - We're going to the road! - Look, l'm telling you that-- Come on, come on, come on. l can't believe you didn't tell me the minute l walked through the fucking door. - That was my idea. l'm sorry. - Always playing an angle, aren't you? Gimme that account number. What are we doing? We gotta tell him. Nothing's changed. He'll call the cops. His kid's dead and we're letting him throw away a million bucks? lt's the only way l can save my kid. You couldn't fucking help me, could you? - Christ. - Christ what? And you would do some-- Done. Hey, Ma, um... l know you're sleeping, but, um... look, l-- um, l-- l was just calling you 'cause l'm gonna-- l'm gonna be home a little late tomorrow. - Yeah? - Yeah, we got it. - Oh man, that's so awesome. - Give that to me.

Well, if that's what you really want. You take the road. - l'm going straight on. - What'd he say? Kill them. lt can't be much longer. They can't be that far away. How do we know? They could be anywhere. l don't know, l'm just assuming. They were on their way here. You know, l really admire your confidence, Rick. What do you mean? Well, you seem to be pretty sure that this guy's gonna let them go. Why is that? Hailey, come on. What the fuck is the matter with you? Oh, come on. Don't tell me it hasn't crossed your mind, Nick. That we just happened to be in your father's place? - That they knew it would be open? - No no, it hadn't crossed my mind. l mean, do you think it's that obvious? Do you think it's that simple? Yeah, maybe it is. l'm his son, Hailey. He's not gonna hurt me. Well, you're not hurt, are you, Nick? Jesus Christ. What the fuck am l doing with you? And you're a real catch, huh? A hero? Jeff is dead! You didn't stop them! - You didn't do anything! - What the fuck was l supposed - to do, Hailey? Look, you'll get your money. You don't have to do this. - But l want to. - Please, no. No, please! Nick: Go go go! Go! Go! Fuck you! - l've got my money. - Okay, what about our kids? - You got what you wanted. - You'll get them back in an hour. This is the last time you'll be speaking to me. ln the meantime, l don't want you to make or take any phone calls. Do you understand? - Yes. - Good. And by the way, tell your kids the show has been canceled. - What? - They'll know what l'm talking about. Okay, l need to know our kids are safe. They're safe. He got the money. He says he'll have them back in an hour. Excuse me, Mr. Jones, can l call my wife? - She panics if l'm-- - l'm sorry, not tonight. Of course. l'm sorry. Don't you ever get tired of knowing your place, Frank? - No sir. - Don't call me sir. - l'm not paying your goddamn wages. - All right, that's enough. ls it? l think l can say exactly what l want right now. Okay, say exactly what you want right now, Bob. Well, you know what they say about these things, don't you, Richard? No, go on, tell us, Bob. That they sometimes turn out to be an inside job. Am l right, Cliff? - You're not serious? - You're the one who needed the money. Are you outta your fucking mind? lt's the truth, isn't it? Well, how come you suddenly have no money, you come in here like you're king of the hill? You want the truth? Here it is. l got burned-- big time. The party's over for me. But who wants to hear that in the land of milk and fucking honey? l'm done! Fucking happy? Hey, Richard, just one question. ls this one of your pump-and-dump scams? Bail out when the price gets high enough? - Wh-- where is this all coming from? - l'm just asking. What, are you two guys the sons of the soil, huh? l got news for you-- we all do the same fucking thing. We push numbers around and we fuck everybody else as long as we get ours. End of story. Only your numbers don't always add up, do they? And right now you decided that that bothers you? No, right now you're the odd man out. - Yeah? - Yeah. Not tonight, Bob. That's you. Oh, and how's that? Tell me! All right, l'm sorry. Let's just cool it. All right, we're saying shit that we don't mean. Let's just keep it together. They killed Jeff. Come on, we've got to get them out of the house. Don't don't don't. - What? - Come on. Come on, come on, pick up the fucking phone. - We're too late. - No, we're not too late. Fuck 'em. Try the cops. You killed my best friend, you bitch. You fucking killed him! No, fuck you! Nick, stop! Get-- Nick, stop! Nick. l recognize her. l've seen her around campus and the other one. All right? Yeah. l think you're right. Come on. Come on, let's go. Come on. Here, Bob. That could help. Oh Christ. lt would have helped if you'd saved my son. Bob, there was nothing that we could do. We didn't have a chance to save him, Bob. l had to tell them that you weren't here. Why the hell did you tell them l wasn't here? - Why did they have to know that? - Because l was stalling him. l didn't know if we could get the money together. - Our kids' lives were at stake. - No, my kid's life was at stake! - My kid! - Bob, you weren't here. We couldn't have saved him. Oh. Well, you certainly got your shit together when it came to taking my money, didn't you, Rich? What else could l do? Let them kill Nick too? You'll get your money back, okay? Every cent. Fuck you! All right, let's just say that l accept everything you've said. You don't seriously think l'm going to sit here all night while the psycho who's got my money-- killed my son-- just walks away? - We don't have any choice. - Well, you might not have a choice, but l do and l choose to do something about it. No, Bob, Bob, l'm not going to let you do that. - Gimme the phone! - No! - You're not calling the police. - Maybe if you had Jeff would still be alive. No, if you were here, he'd still be alive, Bob! lf you were fucking here! - You fucker. - No, God damn it. - Let go. - Come on. Let go of me! Fuck! Where did they go? l don't know. Get up. Get up. Get up! Which way? Who cares? Fucking asshole. You're the fucking asshole! You're the fucking asshole. Get up! Stupid motherfucker. What's with this? Where's mine, huh? That's not my car. She was like that when l got here. They must've... Where did they go? l don't know. They're alive. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Hmm? Blanks! Yeah, l knew you wouldn't be able to control yourself, Dean. Fucking smartass. Well? What are we waiting for? Let's get out of here. lt's gonna blow any second. Dean? You were right. You're all on your own. l knew it. l knew it. l fucking knew it! - How could l be so fucking dumb? - See, Dean, you're not dumb. You're unstable. You're antisocial and you have a grudge against society like your friend here. Okay? Two freaks fucking pissed off at all those rich college kids they see walking across campus every day. Nobody's gonna be surprised that you tried a thing like this. Nobody. You won't get away with it. Oh. No, see, l don't have to ''get away'' with anything. As far as they're concerned there were only two people. There's the girl-- who's dead... and the guy on the phone. That's yours, by the way. lt's a shame about the plane tickets you bought with this credit card. You're not going to be able to use those. l don't exist, you understand? There's no trail, no evidence. Nothing. Oh, you're clever. Yeah, but when the house blows, they'll find something-- some trace. They always do. And you will go down. You will fucking go down! You will go down for it. God, you really are stupid, Dean. A bomb? The transmitter, the house blowing up? Really? l just made that shit up to turn you on, Dean. See, l know everything about you. Everything. And soon they will too. They're gonna know that you have big highs and even bigger lows. And that when the shit hit the fan, you were always gonna do that thing-- the thing that you've tried before. The second time's a charm. - Hailey! - Daddy! - Nick! - Oh, thank Christ. Hey, we gotta get out of here. The whole place is about to blow. - What do you mean? - Your laptop, it's a detonator and the modem's rigged with explosives. lt's a big finale. - My laptop? - lt was supposed to go off - like 10 minutes ago. - l never bring my laptop here. - What? - Maybe that's what he meant. The last thing he said to me was to tell them - the show's been canceled. - Why would they even tell us that - in the first place if-- - Probably just to mess with your heads. - Oh fuck. - Did you ever have anything to do with these people before? Because they seem to know us. These two kids, we think we've seen them before around campus. - Nick: Yeah. - All right, well, all that matters - is that you're safe. Nick, it's them. No no, it can't be. They've got the money. - No, but they came after us. - What do you mean they came after you? We just escaped. What the hell do you think we're doing here? - l don't know him. Do you? - No, it's not them. Can l help you? Paul. - Dad. - What happened to you? There was this guy at the gas station. He had this girl knocked out at his feet. - That's the same people who got us. - Anyway, l was gonna keep on driving, but he pulls out a gun and tries to pull me out of the goddamn car and that's when-- anyway, l managed to hit him and l got away, but l think l got pretty lucky, you know? Well, come on in. Thanks. - So do we know who they are? - Yeah-- well, we don't know them. They, um, they held us ransom. And they killed our best friend. - You're kidding? - Are you kidding, Hailey? Mr. Vincent... l am so sorry. We loved Jeff. But there was nothing we could do. - l think it's time we called the cops. - l already called them. - They're on their way. - Paul, what are you doing here? Mom's worried sick. You always call when you're gonna be this late. And l kept calling and calling but there was no answer. We heard it ringing, but they told us not to answer the phone. Listen, come on in, come on in. Hey. Didn't Frank used to bring you around when we were kids? - Yeah, but then-- - You-- you had your own friends. l just thought it was better that we didn't impose. Dad, it was in our house. What? Where they held us. But you got away, right? - Yeah. - When? l don't know. Three, maybe four hours ago. No, what he wants to know is did you get away before he paid up. No, Bob, that's not what l meant. There's just one thing, Nick. Did you know your big-shot daddy was broke? - For God's sake. - Bob: Now how about that? But it's okay. l spotted him a couple of bucks. lt's nothing, Nick. Where are these cops? We're a long way out of town, sir. Yeah well, and in the meantime these fuckers are getting away. Where's my lighter? We'll arrange for you to come down and make a formal statement. Any time, Officer. l don't know what kind of country we're living in anymore. - What happened to our kids? - l wish l knew. lt seems like every day there's a-- That's just the way it is. At least your son's okay. You're both free to go. Oh, and one more thing-- we're gonna need to check your car for prints. You can pick it up tomorrow. Yeah, of course. - There you go. - Come on, we'll take mine. Let's get out of here. - Dick: And here we are. - Yeah, that's about it. Thanks. Nick: Bob, why don't you let us give you a ride home? You shouldn't be on your own. - Good idea. - l'll call you. - Bye, Hailey. - Okay. Nick? All those things l said... sorry. Cigarette? All right. Are you okay, son? Yeah, l'm okay. l can't go back there. You don't have to. Hey, Pop. Everything's going to be okay. Everything. We played by the rules. l wanted to play by the rules. But that's the big lie. lt's not enough anymore. So maybe just once you've gotta break them. Right? ( techno music playing ) ( music stops )
