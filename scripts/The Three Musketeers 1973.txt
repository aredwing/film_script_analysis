Save your skin ... and will be soon. What is your name? - D'Artagnan. - Well ... Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan. Attack! Let us pray. Praise our Lord Jesus Christ. I? Sorry. A sword! By God! Thank you. D'Artagnan! No! No! Djenmelo to me! Fight! - No! Surrender Biscart! I command. In that case ... To ring the bells. The nuns attend to the wounded. Come, gentlemen, the sooner the better. - Yes, yes, it ended quickly. Velvet flamenco! The layer has been ruined! You will pay for this. It took me ten pistoles of gold. No, twenty. Twenty doubloons. And twenty more to teach manners. Thief! Charity is a virtue Cardinal, remember? Will we still here talking until the marshal arrest us? Come on, gentlemen. In what refers to wounds, I have a very good ointment prepared by my mother. I threw my sword through the air ... - Porthos! Porthos! Give it to me. The motto of the Musketeers is: All for one and one for all. For it is ten, ten for him, ten for you and ten for me. My dear Aramis takes ten to impress your lover. My dear Porthos takes ten to dress decently. And you need ten to accommodation and servitude, I suggest. And I ... - Do you? I need a drink. You see that life is rosy after emptying his glass. Be careful. What kind of horse is this? This is the ladder. I think you'll like, sir. For only two francs a day ... this room is wonderful. Scrupulously clean. The cleaned every other day. For a negligible amount. You sleep outside. When it hit, guests will not hear the screams. In Paris are very few rooms like this. Where else have a beautiful view of the city? You call this room, is a dump that is not worthy of ... of a king or a cardinal, but I like it. Did you say two francs? Does it take? - If available ... Ah, my wife. Is not it beautiful? - Lovely. Thank you, sir. - It is soft as petals fall ... From afar! My wife is the seamstress of the Queen. The Queen is a charming person. My wife has earned their trust. I am very proud to be her husband.

Come on! I said faster! Wonderful! It's wonderful. I'm dizzy. The queen four diagonally to the king. - The queen four diagonally to the king. Your thugs beat Cardinal off guard. Your Musketeers, Highness. - Your ruffians. Riding the bishop. Riding the bishop. It is difficult to explain. Who watches over France and works tirelessly while I was distracted ... Does your majesty refers to God? - I am referring to Cardinal Richelieu, not exactly the same. Oh, Cardinal ... The issue of the Musketeers of Treville ... Broken heads and broken swords. Nonsense, sir. The Duke Buckingham is in Paris. Buckingham ? Here? Why, God? Why intrigue against my honor? - For the Queen. Arrest this traitor! - Sir, you are wrong. The Queen you is faithful, to you and to France. He loves you warmly. I do not feel so hot. Arrest him. But why should we arrest Prime Minister of England? No, Your Highness. We must keep the noble duke at bay, to maintain his treaty with the Protestants and continue with its policy hidden. And for the Queen be hidden under your window? The beauty of the Queen awakens all kinds of wonder ... and attracts all kinds of fans. But virtue is indisputable. As the Duke of Buckingham, will be monitored. Two to the queen bishop. Jaque. This way. Open up! Or we take the door down! Someone's coming! - Oh, dear! Come with me. - Oh, no. Do not go with you. Do not go with you. We shall see. Let's see. Come with me. - Yes, sir, I accompany him. Stop Her! Stop Her! What have you done with my wife? Mr. D'Artagnan, please ... - Expect to catch my breath. Have I hurt? Lord, I have to go see the Queen. - I can not afford it. I have been out of bed. - The best place for you ... The bed is the best place for you. Have a seat. Thank you, sir. They have taken my husband. - Where? At the Bastille. Oh, sorry. It is best to sleep. Try to forget everything. I can not sleep with my husband in the Bastille. I have fear. - I do not. Should lie with me, not to feel fear. I have to go see the Queen. I need urgently. I can not let go. The streets are very dangerous, and his legs and feet are dirty. Oh ... yes. You have to help. You are young and gallant. My husband is weak and ... is a bit crazy. I can tell you something? I can trust you? - For the life that beats in your chest. I listen like a bird flapping white. I have to see the queen. - I hear their flapping. Maybe because I enjoy the confidence The Queen, Cardinal attacks me. You can not go to see the Queen with dirty legs. No. Do you have the strength to wash them? - No. Oh, my poor husband. Without it I feel so helpless. I've never washed the legs of a woman. A horse does. It starts at the top. I can not go to see the queen being dirty. Do you think I'm safe here? Oh, yes, Constance, yeah ... Oh, it's ... a little cold. Let me take you a little. - No, I have to leave. I have to meet someone. - Who? Already jealous? Every inch of your body. I'm going. Promise you will not follow me. Oh! Money for the blind ... - Do not you have eyes? Money for a disabled ... Out! Money for a cripple! Today is not your day, huh? - Money for an orphan! Money for a veteran. Money ... Before the rise ... Lord, have you any money? One moment, sir. You promised me. - Now I see why you asked. You have nothing to do with me. - No, but with this lady. Give me your arm, ma'am. Good evening, sir. Please, my lord. - Milord? Do you ... ? The Duke of Buckingham. See? It'll ruin everything. - Oh, dear, forgive me. Oh, my lord, I do not know what to say. I love her and I felt jealous. Good excuse to attack a stranger in the dark. Can you do me a favor? Whatever, my lord. - When we get to the palace, we should not be seen. If someone tries to follow, please kill him. Thank you. Oh, yeah ... yes. Do you know of a more intimate that the public square? Well, I ... - Wait here. Anne ... - Why did you come? - To see you. How foolish! The King suspected, and the cardinal knows. Destroy me if you can. What if we discover? - They can discover, where no dirty laundry. There is hope. I am the wife of the King. A Parisian vulgar, that ignores you, but is jealous. What do you owe? I do not want to dishonor. So I ask you to leave and do not return. Oh, dear, we are not humble people. - Indeed. It affects us both. I am not a landowner or a farmer. I am the ruler of a great state. With many ships and armies. The English and were soon in France. But never had a better reason than mine. Do you think that a war prevent me conquer? France expected to claim their rights to the throne of England. Dear, dear Anne ... Do you know? You're the most beautiful I have ever seen in a laundry. Anne, tell me again that you love. You have to leave. We're not sure. Someday we will be. Until then, give me something to remember, a test ... Anything. Give me something, sweetheart. It's the best I have. Will bring it before a year. Oh ... They do! In the future take my shirt with more respect. Oh, God! Go, quick! Stop! Over here! Sorry! Please tell me why ... Fight, chicken! Come, I have not finished! Oh, thank you. Come on! Oh, sir. Could habrmelas managed alone, but thanks anyway, gentlemen. And who was that? - Do not know. He had a slight accent. By God, what happened? Forward. - I say I was alone at home, lying, and entered my room. I swear, I have done nothing, nothing! What will you do to me? All. If you're in the Bastille, something you've done. You are guilty of high treason. You are accused of conspiring with your wife and the Duke of Buckingham. No, no ... Do you know your accusers? Who brought you here? That's the man! Take him! - No, not him. It is a very respectable gentleman ... Were found. The Queen and Buckingham. - Where? - In the palace. I learned too late. - Are you got out of hand? - From yours. I had no orders. - What happened? - The Bonacieux accompanied Buckingham. Did Ms. Bonacieux? I thought I told that the arrestaras and retuvieras. Failed. It happens. Should I commit such a mistake, I cut off the head. But higher up than mine. Is it true? From a more ambitious level. - Do not you have ambitions? - No. Do I fear, Rochefort? Yes, sir. I'm afraid, Your Eminence. And I also hate. I love you, my son. Even when you fail. The Queen gave Buckingham the necklace of twelve diamonds that King gave him for his last birthday. I do not know where he is now Buckingham. Spare me all that you do not know. Buckingham will be in Calais. This time we let go. No, no, please! Let me go, please! Enough! It hurts! It must be. You have disappointed me! Disappointed! I thought you were a traitor. Arise, friend. What I can say? All suspected about you are unfounded. The Cardinal took my hand and called me "friend." This needs to be fixed. Take these hundred pistoles and ... forgive me. - I? Forgive your Eminence? Do not be speaking seriously. I am nobody. I'm less than anyone. Dude, you are very generous. I hope you come back to visit, so we can talk. Until next time. I have done everything possible. Spy on his wife. - Think that I have fear! Surely the gallant Buckingham take the diamond necklace. Sends word to Mrs. De Winter, in England, to be near him and take away two of the diamonds. Go and take care that I bring them immediately. Is how to get your business. This place will like. It is very cheap. Wait a minute. I will win some money for us. It's him! The winner! Come on, man! - We will not have for dinner. I win! He wins! I'm starving! How about a chicken? It is eaten on Wednesdays. - It's Tuesday. Ribs? - No, what horror. I want to eat something good. Tell us cook this. Big Guy! I know what you are doing. I already know. Right? For the inconvenience, sir. Oh, look at the feathers. Have you heard screaming? Have you heard His Eminence wants to see you dance. Suggests that organized a dance in your honor. What pleases your Majesty, I like me too. - At the Hotel de Ville. Within two weeks. Will enjoy. Dance, Ballett, costumes and ... What else? Oh, you can take the diamond necklace that I gave. It will be the highlight of the night. Does the diamond necklace? Yes, diamonds that you gave. Why not? Do not you think that you look great? - Yes Yes, they are beautiful, sir. - So why not? I want you bear. I hope so, ma'am. This bird grabs me strong. It makes me mourn how strong is clings to my hand. You see the tears? Oh, dance with diamonds. Want to see the Queen dancing. We're getting romantic despite the religious habit. Even a cardinal has weaknesses, your Majesty. A king too. You see the tears? The following conversation took place in the bedroom of Mrs. Bonacieux. The queen said: "I am lost, I'm lost." Ms. Bonacieux said: "Majesty." "Constance, I am lost." "Majesty." "What I can do, Constance?" "We can recover the diamonds." - "Fourteen days? I'm lost." "Majesty, in fourteen days someone can go to London and back to Paris. " "Who? I do not trust anyone. That devil has spies everywhere. That evil man, dirty, filthy. Evil, nasty, dirty, that evil man, calling himself a priest. " Is what sets here. I find a messenger, majesty, who can be trusted. I swear. He may carry a letter from you the Duke of Buckingham. Yes, a letter. I will write. On my honor and my life. Have someone you trust? - Majesty, he did not ... The Queen is in great danger, unless it is carried this letter immediately to London. You have to leave immediately. I am the only person he trusts. And you are the only in whom I trust. Letters, danger ... Come to bed, Constance, my chick. And I'll ... I will do anything you ask if you promise to take this letter. I know nothing about cards, beautiful Constance. I spent many days and nights without you. No, I'm serious ... - I also ... The letter must leave now. - If you say so. I do not want you to trust me, because this suspicious letter smacks of intrigue. Constance, Constance ... Yes, intrigue. The intrigues of your Queen. And I was taken to the Bastille. But I do not want which leads me to the Bastille, because there is deep basements and terrible instruments of torture, run by ruthless people. Cut the parts people! If it were not for the Cardinal ... Does the cardinal? - Yes, the Cardinal. Think you're the only one important friends, but I will tell that Cardinal took my hand and called me "friend." And he gave me this purse. Were you the cardinal? - I'll tell you more, dear. He does not like this kind of intrigue. Say, for whom is this letter? You have to know if you carry it. Okay, lady rebel. If you do not want to go to bed with me, I must leave you. I have a very important appointment. A very important date! Oh, you! - I. Have you heard? - Each word. - So you know. discrete, active, smart and loyal. Also, I know the way to London, and your good husband, that will surely see the cardinal, will take care of my expenses. I can trust you? - Trust me? Trust in me? Oh, what a question! You can trust me because I love you. And you love me. If you do not love me Something about you is wrong. You must swear never reveal the name of the recipient. Word of honor. His name is called Duke of Buckingham. Over here! There has been a long time your husband! Come on. This often occurs. Constance! Constance! He's gone. You should have known to not accept the letter. Evidently, has gone to take refuge at the palace. No one, but the candle is warm. - Quick, to the palace! It can not be far off. That letter said his wife ... Was it for the Duke of Buckingham? - No, sir, without naming names. Here lives that D'Artagnan, is not it? We have to get them a cold home Mr. D'Artagnan and his friends. In the Bastille. - What next? In the Bastille there is no "later." What? That man has insulted me, has broken the sword of my father, made me hit and has abused the woman I love. I find ... drawback. Let me tell you something on your knight "inconvenient." It's called Rochefort. It is the weapon of the cardinal, and is fatal. Move, you little fool! Fifteen to zero. Fifteen more. Fifteen all. Thirty to fifteen. If someday you see Rochefort walking across the street, do not bother to say hello. Aramis! What are you doing? Your only chance. - You run the risk. With or without Rochefort, I have to take that letter to London. It's the Queen. I have to return to response within fourteen days. Thou shalt not go even five miles. Last game. Do you really want to? If we are four, the letter will arrive. It was our money for dinner. Huguenot is better than a potato before than you. Gather up your things. We're going to London. - London? Me, a piece of stupid? Your souls are corrupted. The kingdom of God is yours. When do we leave? - Immediately. How do we get horses? - Selling our servants. A servant sold its secrets. A gentleman never. If something happens to one of us, others are responsible for the letter. He who falls, you must see how to cope. Right? No one has asked yet why risk our life. Do we give explanations the King? If we must fight, you fight. Then we will die. It is useless be too many questions. Beware the saddle! Worth more than you win. I'm coming, sir. - Good morning, sir! - Similarly, sir. Offer, sir? - With pleasure. For the cardinal! With pleasure, if you provides us by the King. No toast to the King, drink to the Cardinal. Are you drunk, sir. To this there is only one answer. Pay for that. What folly! Get rid of it follower when you can. Come on! You were only three. - But the man is drunk. It will go away drunk. Damn! Look! Stop! Stop! Go, go on! Come on! Come on! Drop the gun! The same fate awaits us ten miles from here. But at least until we get there will be safe. Forward! Although it is treason, French women seem the most beautiful women. To an Englishman can never believe. Go to bed, Felton! That face can bring nightmares to anyone. I take all that bring a pass from the cardinal. I have a pass. This morning came the order that no one can leave the country without the signature of the mayor. Okay, back in an hour. But pay attention. Some enemies of the state trying to escape. You could do me a favor, sir. Give me the pass you have in your pocket and save us trouble. You Gascon bay horse that loitering and looking for a fight through the streets with the Musketeers. On the streets you avoids frequent, sir Cyclops. Where are your three companions? It would have been better ... Me, me! Do not be afraid, sir. Here I go. Here I go! I told you. Is he dead, sir? Not at all. It's just a scratch. Oh, father, what you do with your son! Is he dead? It's a little dizzy, sir. Did you kill? Absolutely not. tale hands and amordzalo. We give you the opportunity of bleeding, but do not assassinate. The pass is for one person. - I am a single person. This is a servant. - I see. Are you all right? Look! Dover! My lord! Oh, the jealous lover. I hope not come to England to fight me. Unfortunately, I can not read. How many days has been on its way? - Six days, my lord. Then we must hurry. Come Plachet, hasten. Well, I like to rush. Come on! At the gallop! One, two ... Yes, sir. She is my goddess. Here they are. Expected preserving them forever. God in heaven! It's two. - How? - Let me think. I put them to the dance two weeks ago. The Countess de Winter. My God! A high price for infidelity. Possibly already in France! Felton! Were stolen by a spy of the cardinal. Felton, my secretary. I give an order. Got a pencil? Write to all ports in the channel. That no ship leaving port! If the King asks, tell him I'm thinking in a war against France. And keep open the way to Dover. , Six days? Will risk your life time to take them to the Queen. But ... and missing? - O'Reilly. Tell me what it's worth every one of these. Nothing here ... nothing around here. I would say ... 500 pounds. How long need to make two? One week. - I give you 5,000 per one if they are ready after tomorrow. Done. Could you tell my wife will not go back home? Better yet: Jackson, go get Ms. O'Reilly in a carriage. And preprenle a room. - Oh, how nice. Have you hurt? - It's nothing. Beautiful, beautiful. Is it a compliment to say that go well with your eyes? An unusual gallantry. Normally, you compare them with my heart. So I thought. Top Cardinal, down the Queen. Faster! Tell me now what are the new, if you can. Now, for the honor of the great woman who both serve, You must try you receive them in time. I'm on the way. - And you, sir ... How I can repay you? My lord, to see if we understand ... You are English, an enemy of France. I did what I've done for the Queen. I appreciate as much as you. With your permission, I say goodbye. My apologies. I forgot that England is an island. How do I go? You will find horses, the road Free Dover, and a boat waiting. Lord, not accept the reward of a friend. Would you accept this, at least? And this, of an enemy. That is another thing. I'm tired. - Me too. We're almost there. Shut up! - I have hemorrhoids. We need other horses. - Do you recognize this place? - No. Here were all together, alive. Farewell, friends! Will not be long. Take me out of here! The rope! Quick! The horse! Hold on! By God, where are you? Through the door, out the door! The horses are exhausted. About time! Come on, come on! - Fanfarrn! - Why do you always stay behind? Have you heard that voice? - This unfortunate accent! All for one and one for all! My wife is inside. Dance with important people. And sometimes sends me a greeting hand. Sometimes. Lady, why not take the diamond necklace? I knew I wanted to take him today. Majesty, in this crowd I have fear of losing it. He is wrong. I made this gift for people to admire her. I am very disappointed. If your Majesty wishes, command to look to the palace. Do it ... immediately. Go ahead, Reggie. The wine overflows. I do what I can. His Majesty is very pale. You allow me to divert your attention for sweets this box? Will agree with me they are a real treat. What does this mean? - Nothing. If the Queen brings the necklace, which I doubt, diamonds reckon, sir. If you find only ten, ask him to His Majesty where they can be the other two. No one can enter without an invitation. Orders of the cardinal. What does it say, sir? I say that ... Never mind. We as well. Come, come, as well. Again! Oh, madam, may still arrive. I'm sure will come. No, Constance. It makes no sense. All is lost. It ... That has to be Constance. Ignite the fireworks when the trumpet sounds. - Yes, sir. D'Artagnan! - How? I'm coming, Constance. Come on, get out! Sorry. Why detenis you, gentlemen? Hurry! - Yes - Takes! Back! Damn! Come on! Guards! Stop him! Follow that bear! Here you are, old friends! You have come to save me! Thank God you are alive! You help me up? Wait a minute. It has torn our carpet. Fast, gentlemen! On your marks! Three, four, five ... What a fool I am! One, two, three, four ... One, two, three, four ... Be still! Come, come here! Excuse me, please. You have made my wish come true, but I think missing two. Here we bring them. Lord, bring me two more. What kindness! Now I have fourteen. Fourteen ? Fourteen ... What, cardinal? It means, sir; I wanted to give that gift His Majesty but, not daring, have given them through you. I am immensely grateful, Your Eminence. I am sure that these two cost you much more what the other twelve cost his Majesty. Eminence, D'Artagnan managed to enter. - Is fine. I've failed and I lost points. The game continues. - Looking for perhaps the young? What for? Why get even? Revenge is an expensive luxury. Statesmen can not afford it. Also, I need it. Maybe I need to get it. His Eminence is a great player, enough to lose. I do not like to lose. Do what you can, my lady. But if you lose, do it with dignity. Oh, dear, dear, dear. Do not want you back to take such a risk. Oh, gallops, struggles, lunges. Not much! It's my job. If at the end Constance find my beautiful ... Do I have missed? What a silly question ... I work for him. Yes, sir. Gascon, now you musketeer. Take the real musket, Now that you are Four Musketeers. Now we are four. There's my boss. Greets you. Take! Oh, King!
