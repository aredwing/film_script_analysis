Like, no one can touch John Cena. Sin Cara can. Scooby Dooby-Doo! 1, 2, 3. Sin Cara wins it. Way to go, Scooby-Doo, old buddy. Booyah. Dooby-Doo. Congratulations. You just beat the game on the hardest level ever... double triple beatdown extreme. But can you complete the victory dance? Oh, yeah. It's all yours, pal. You earned it. Perfect score! - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo-hoo! Hello there. I'm Vince McMahon, chairman and ceo of WWE. Mr. McMahon. We're not worthy. Because you beat the game on this level and executed a perfect score on the victory dance, you win a special prize. We did? You've won an all-expense paid trip to WWE city. Come revel in a place dedicated to everything WWE. It'll be a week of fun and excitement, culminating in ringside seats at WrestleMania. Don't miss it. Report to training camp in WWE city as soon as possible with this game disc as proof of your win to claim your prize. Like, WrestleMania. Ha ha ha! You gotta be kidding me. Think of it. - The fun. - The fans. The food! We gotta go, old pal. Like, we just gotta go. We gotta go. Like, we just gotta go. It's the ultimate slamtastic life-affirming experience of a lifetime. It's WrestleMania. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I don't know, guys. It's not something we're really into. And I have a lot of reading to catch up on. Uh, no, thank you. Like, come on, guys. Scoob and I never ask for anything. Like, I can't count how many times the two of us were bait to catch some crazy mask-wearing villain. Yeah. I got the photos to prove it. Take a good look, people. Exhibit "a." Like, here's the time you guys made us dress like giant tools to catch the monstrous mechanic. Or as ducks to catch the horrific huntsman. Or when we had to be the cow to catch the crazed cowgirl from beyond the grave. Scooby-Doo almost got milked. It was so humiliating. And the pice De rsistance, the time we posed as seor Pepe Jose and the dancing hairless chihuahua don pero to catch the ghastly gordito of Guadalajara. Yeah, the hair didn't even grow back in some places. Scooby was naked. Look at him. - Just look at him! - No, no. Ok. We get it. You win, shaggy. Win? Wait, what? I was actually thinking about taking a trip anyway to try out my new allodium q-36 digital slr camera and optical stabilizer zoom lens. Maybe I can snap some action-packed pictures. And this will give me an opportunity to explore the parallels between the modern world of WWE vs. Ancient warrior customs. Besides, it beats another weekend with grandpa dinkley and his mysterious odor problem. Scooby-Doo almost got milked. The hair didn't even grow back in some places. Ok, we'll go to WrestleMania. Whoo-hoo! WWE city, here we come. Oh, boy. Hee hee hee! Here comes the flying huna caruna off the top ropes. Ha ha ha! And it's countered by Scooby's patented corkscrew counter crunch. Um, exactly how many more play-by-play Scooby snack attacks will we have to endure before WWE city? Like, we brought everything we had. Scooby and I need to keep our energy up so we can cheer like crazy at the main event. There's so many boxes I can't even see the luggage. Luggage? You didn't pack the luggage? Ruh-roh. Of all the food-induced, insane things you two have done, this absolutely takes the cake. Mmm. Cake. I mean it. Like, what's the big deal? We all wear the same outfits every single day anyway. Well, you gotta admit it, he does have a point. Hmph. Hey, look. Like, WWE city, next exit. Hold the phone! Looks like we're stuck. There's a car coming. Maybe they can help. Well, now, this ain't a good place for a breakdown. Can we help you kids out? John Cena. Whoa. Ok. Looks like you kids ran into some trouble. This ain't safe, champ. We gotta keep moving. Calm down, cookie. I'm just saying that it's dangerous out here at night, what with the bear trouble and all. That's why ruben, my nephew here, and I have been following the superstars on their jogs. Hi. Well, these kids aren't going anywhere while their van is stuck. This shouldn't take long. Uh, what's he gonna do, lift the van out of the ditch? Scooby! Shaggy! Cool. I didn't know WWE superstars were so hot. Strong! I mean strong. Grr! Scooby, no! Come back! Scooby! Scooby! Scoob, stop! Aah! Scooby-Doo, where are you? Zoinks! A mo... a mo... monster! Monster? Where? Where? Oh, scoob! Ha ha ha! You had me worried, pal. - It's me. - It's you. Yikes! What are you two doing in my woods? Um, leaving. Cool down a bit, bayard. The dog and the long haired fella didn't mean to trespass. They're just fans come for the WWE. They all come for that. And the more they come, the hungrier they make the beast. The beast? The beast called WWE city. Every day it eats up more and more of our land. But not for long, 'cause there's a storm a-coming, and we're gonna watch it blow you all out of here like dead leaves. Now, get off my property. Oh, don't let old bayard spook you. He's not what you call a people person. Still, it's not right. Can I make it up to you by offering you some vip seats at our live event tonight? Would you be interested? Would we? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to WWE. Uhh! Ahh! Uhh! Like, pinch me, I think I'm dreaming. Ow! I'm not dreaming. Boy, what an exciting tag team match we have here tonight. The big show and Alberto del Rio are up against sin Cara and John Cena. And Cena wastes no time delivering an elbow to big show. Whoo-hoo! Yes! Big show with a chop. And del Rio blindsides Cena. That was a dirty move. And I think the ref agrees. Oh, my goodness, sin Cara's up. And he delivers high-flying justice to del Rio. - Whoo-hoo! - Heh heh heh! And it looks like the end for Cena. But somehow Cena reverses. He's got big show up. Oh, no! Look out! That was my favorite table. Del Rio's up. But he walks right into Cena's sidewalk slam. And the crowd goes wild. But wait, big show's back. With a picnic table? Where did he get a picnic table? Oh, the humanity. I don't see anything in the rules about the use of furniture. It's a show, velma. It's sin Cara to the rescue with a tilt-a-whirl. And it's a takedown of the big show. Oh! Whoo-hoo! - W! - W! Best move ever. Cena gathers his... Well, I can't say I'm bored. And here it comes. You can't see me. Cena's vintage 5 knuckle shuffle. Let's go, cena! Let's go, cena! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Yay! With incredible strength, cena takes big show to the top ropes. An avalanche. Attitude adjustment. Into the cover. 1, 2, 3! It's over! Cena for the win. Yeah! Yeah, man! Amazing, dude! Tonight's tag team winners, John cena and sin Cara. Oh, cena! My gosh, you're wonderful. No chance, that's what you got Welcome, fans. You should be excited because I'm about to lay on you something very heavy... our very own WWE championship belt. Ahh. Yes, it's solid gold, encrusted with priceless gems and jewels, but any WWE superstar will tell you it's not about the glitter. The championship belt represents honor, respect, hard work, dedication, the very soul of WWE. As you know, ever since Kane's WWE championship match was overturned, this championship belt has been held vacant. And so it shall remain until a true champion rises up and proves themself worthy this weekend in the main event at WrestleMania. Did you know that a golden ceremonial prize was customary at ancient games for thousands of years? No, velma. Thank you. Oh, it's a text from John cena, thanking me personally for all the cheering. That's a keeper. When did you give cena your phone number? Oh, when I gave him my email, my home address, and my scarf size. Hey, why don't you crazy kids join us at the training camp tonight? It's something to see. WWE training camp? How'd you like sin Cara's convertible? Like, it's a real muscle machine. Here we are, guys. WWE's rock yard, where the pros train for greatness. Ahh! Uhh! Look! It's sergeant slaughter. Like, zowie! There's Jerry "the king" lawler. And Jimmy hart. Here at camp, we even have our own 24-hour restaurant. It's like home. More like paradise. Ha ha ha! Is that the championship belt? That's right, carved into the Mountain. A prize set in stone and the dream of every superstar. Mr. sin Cara, could we stop for a second? Uhh! Uhh! Sweet. Way to go, ruben. That was a nice job. Yeah, nice move, Ruby. Yeah, funktastic, baby. Like, wow, I didn't know your nephew dude was a superstar. That's what he'd like to think. I'd better get you all settled into your cabins. Up ahead on the left, sin Cara. I can't believe shaggy and Scooby left all our luggage behind. Now all I have are these two scarves. Which do you think John would like better? Seriously? Seriously. Be honest. The one on the right. My thoughts exactly. I don't understand, Uncle cookie. It's just not fair. You know I'm good. I know you know I'm good. Why won't you help me get into WWE? Somebody's got to put some sense into you. Do you think I built this brace because it looks good? All it takes is one accident to put you out of contention. Maybe I'll be luckier. Maybe not. You have to be practical. You should keep going to your computer classes. Computers, that's the ticket, Ruby. Poor ruben. I feel sorry for him. It's understandable. Ruben represents the heroic male aspiring to the stature of decorated warrior. His journey is relatable, and therefore appealing to a wide audience. Velma, has it ever occurred to you that maybe WWE isn't something you can scientifically explain? Don't be silly, Daphne. Science and logic explain everything. Hey, like, the most awesome thing about WWE? You get all the food you can eat. Yeah. All the food. Big day tomorrow. Cookie said we get to see some superstars training. I want to grab some wicked action shots. Come on, lights out, you two. Okie doke, Fred. Sweet dreams, scoob. You, too, Raggy. All the food. Food. All the food. Food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food. Food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food. Huh? Huh? Huh? Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to Scooby-Doo! You want to take me on? Bring it. Ahh! Ahh! Uhh. Oh, yeah? Prepare to become a Scooby snack. Scoob. Scooby-Doo. Hmm? Like, dude, what are you doing with that bear? Hmm? Aah! Zoinks! Really? Aah! Uhh! Ooh! Aah! Back off, ugly. Time to call your mama. Aah! Ooh! Aah! Uhh! Not funky. Shaggy! Scooby! Are you ok? Ghost... Ghost bear. Then it's true. What's true, cookie? The legend. The monster has returned from the grave. Vicious, the ghost bear has come to challenge us all. Oh. Well, gang, sounds like we have another mystery on our hands? Assault, battery, property damage. Ghost bear! What the heck is going on? And what are you kids doing in WWE city anyway? - We won a contest. - We won a contest. Don't look at me, Richards. You sent out that memo. The victory dance contest. Oh, that's right. That wasn't my idea. Boys over in marketing or game development. One of those. Who can keep things straight with all these bear attacks going on? There have been others? Indeed. Several. All of them inside our buildings. The creature trashed the kitchen and totally obliterated our video game studio. And as quickly as it appears, it disappears. I'm telling you, it's the ghost. An evil from beyond the grave. Let's try to remain calm here. We don't want to jump to any crazy conclusions. - Mr. McMahon. - Mr. McMahon. Like, in the flesh. I can't believe I'm actually face to face with Vinnie Mac. - The boss. - The higher power. - The Mac attack. - The Mac daddy. Daddy Mac. Yes. Ahem. Thanks for that trip down memory Lane. Let me cut to the chase. I've been doing a little research on you kids. You're some kind of mystery solvers. We could really use your help here. Gee, Mr. McMahon, we'd be glad to. My main concern is the championship belt. Not only is it worth a fortune, but WrestleMania wouldn't be the same without it. Excuse me, sir, but we don't need these kids meddling in security matters. I promise the championship belt is well guarded 24/7 with a state-of-the-art electronic laser trip wire alarm system. There's no way the bear could get to it without tripping a beam and setting off an alarm that would bring in half my security men within seconds. I understand, Richards, but it couldn't hurt to have these kids lend a hand. It's what we do. You mind if I help? - Um... - great idea, John. Awesome. Because I think there's someone you should talk to. Sin Cara? He knows the legend of the bear better than anyone. Like, why is he hanging out on the roof? Sin Cara has a flair for drama. - Ahh. - Ahh. But does he even talk? He doesn't have to. Luckily, I speak masked luchador. I'll translate as best I can. The legend of the ghost bear begins 100 years ago when a monstrous bear was part of a traveling show. They named him vicious. And for good reason. The creature had a mean streak a mile wide and twice as ugly. It'd never been beaten, ever. Till it met... Sin Cara Grande, sin Cara's great great great grandfather. He challenged the bear on this very spot long before there was ever a WWE city. The battle between man and bear was epic. The bear was a horrible, unstoppable beast. But when the match was over, it was the man standing victorious. The bear could not contain its anger. He unleashed his rage on the town. Many lives would have been lost that day had it not been for the brave luchador sin Cara Grande. While saving those innocent townfolk, he was injured. Sin Cara Grande would never wrestle again. And the bear? It escaped into the woods, disappearing into a cave north of town, never to be seen again. Until now. Sin Cara believes the spirit of the beast has been stirred by WrestleMania itself, which is why the monster has risen from the grave to have its revenge. But fear not. It is now sin Cara's honor and duty to continue his great great great grandfather's legacy and protect WWE city at any cost. - Wow. - That's amazing, dude. I have half a mind to go out in the woods, find that bear, and rip its head off. I don't know, triple H, he's awfully tough. I think we should stick together. What do you think, Miz? Stick together. I can't believe you two are still hungry after the meal we had. This is just a late night snack. - Right, scoob? - Right. Helps us sleep. Man, if you guys' muscles were as big as your appetites, you'd both be superstars. Like, fredster, don't you want to join the pizzapalooza? Eh, no, thanks. I thought I'd patrol with the guards, maybe get a picture of the ghost bear. I'll lock the door after me. Like, to keep the bear out? To keep Scooby in. Good idea. Like, don't worry, Freddy, the faster we eat... the faster we fall asleep. Ahh! Yah! Like, is something wrong, Ms. Richards? Indeed, there is. The WWE championship belt has been stolen. And we know who did it. Your dog. Uh, but that's ridiculous. Scooby-Doo's been in here with me all night. Isn't that right, old pal? That's right. Oh? I saw that. Uh-uh, nothing to see here. Just me in bed. You, sir... uh, dog, are a thief. But, Ms. Richards, Scooby couldn't have taken the belt. He's never stolen anything in his whole life. Yeah, never. I have proof right here. Last night's security footage. Take a look. Ooh. Uhh. I... I... I did steal it. Say it ain't true, Scooby-Doo. Hold on a second. Is there something strange about Scooby? You really want us to answer that? Yep, this is the championship belt all right. I'd know it anywhere. Take it. And we'll be taking the thief with us as well. No! Don't let them take me, Raggy. No! I won't, pal. Hang on. Don't let them take me, Raggy. I'm innocent. Jinkies! That's it. Come on, we've got to work fast if we're going to save Scooby. All right, kids. What's going on here? Thanks for coming, Mr. McMahon. We've asked you all here to show you that our Scooby isn't a thief. He's just a pawn. Allow me. Here's the security video of Scooby as he was taking the belt. And here's the video file of Scooby doing his winning victory dance from the memory card of shaggy's video game. Yeah, that's a funkadactal move. Is there a point to any of this? Watch as we slow down the victory dance. It's the same movement. Scooby was programmed with a post-hypnotic suggestion to steal the championship belt. Like, that's why he's been sleep walking since he got here. Ohh. Yeah. And just how did the dog get this post-hypnotic programming? My guess is from the video game itself. May I? I'm connecting shaggy's WWE video game file to the tron screen. See, someone highlighted every move with light flashes. Flashes which could have planted a post-hypnotic suggestion in Scooby's brain. Pbblt. Yeah, there's a plant in my brain. Nice hacks, ruben. That's my nephew. He's a computer genius. Listen, kids, as compelling as this theory might be, I'm still a guy that likes to look at the facts. And the fact is, he stole it. And he's going to jail for it. Jail? And it was your video game, so you're going with him... as his accomplice. Accomplice? I'm no accomplice! I'm not even sure I know what that means! Miss Richards, isn't there something we can do to prevent that? - No! - Actually, yes there is. - Whatever it is... - We'll do it. WWE city law states that anyone accused of a crime can compete in the ring for a chance to win their freedom. I have the power to give you that chance. But I have only one competitor left who is looking for a match. - Kane! - Kane! I want another shot at the title. Looks like I'll have to go through you two to get it. I accept the challenge. Like, you know, scoob, I hear prison food isn't that bad. No! You want a chance to prove your innocence in the ring. They accept the challenge, Mr. McMahon. Miss Richards, release these two so they can prepare. Unless they can prove their innocence, their match with Kane will kick off WrestleMania tomorrow night. Like, velma, are you crazy?! Yeah! We can't fight Kane. Look, guys, pull yourselves together. I need you to buy us some time if we're going to solve this mystery, and clear Scooby's name. I don't know, velma, we only have until tomorrow before shaggy and Scooby get slaughtered. Hello! Thanks, Fred. They're going to need a whole lot longer than a day to learn how to compete in the ring. - Could you help them, cookie? - Please? Yeah, yeah, please, please, please! Oh-ho-ho, please, cookie! Eh, well, maybe I can train 'em enough so they might survive... Ooh! For a few minutes. AJ, you want to help me here? Sure, cookie. Hi, boys. I heard you could use some practice sessions. Wouldn't want those itty bitty whiskers to get bent. Like, Scooby-Doo, you know, this may not be so bad after all. Aahh! Never underestimate a diva. - Let's light it up - light it up, light it up let's light it up let's light it up - light it up, light it up let's light it up like the night, like the diamonds I see shining in your eyes light it up, light it up let's light it up let's light up - light it up tonight let's light it up like the night, like the diamonds I see shining in your eyes in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes in your eyes, in your eyes something about the night is magic, I can't explain every time the sun goes down, I feel everything change Feel my temperate rage every night, a brand new page, yeah let's light up - light it up, light it up let's light it up You ok, ruben? No, I'm not ok. I don't understand why my Uncle is willing to train shaggy and Scooby and not me. Just because he never won a championship doesn't mean I can't. Sorry. See, it's just because all my life, I've dreamed of being a WWE superstar. I've even come up with my own name... the bone bender. I got an outfit I made out of spandex and bones. Real bones I ordered off the Internet. Want to see? - Well, maybe later. - Daphne? You got to hide us! AJ's like Kane, with lipstick! Hey, gang, we got maps of the whole area. And I found the perfect place to start looking for clues about the ghost bear. Scooby, shaggy. Where you boys hiding? Like, what are we waiting for? Let's go, let's go, let's go! Like, wouldn't it be better to clear our names than to go, you know, bear hunting? That's just it, shaggy. I can't help thinking that whoever framed Scooby is somehow connected to the ghost bear. Keep it down. We don't want to attract bayard. You mean the hillbilly with the thieving raccoon? Yeah. Their cave is right on his property. Can't say I didn't warn 'em. Zoinks! - Aroo? - Run! Run! Scoob! Aah! Whoo-hoo-hoo-ah! Oh! Ooh, hoo, whoa-ho! - Aah! - Huh?! Like, that was amazing! Cen-amazing! How'd you know where we were? - Daphne texted me. - Mmm. Naturally. What's going on? Hillbilly hospitality. We should keep moving. Come on, I'll explain on the way. This is it, guys. Bear cave. Come on, follow me. Now, that's rich. Those dummies just walked into a trap that's better than any I could make. Bet you that was the original bear. He doesn't look so vicious now. How long do you think he's been there? Who cares, as long as he stays there. Yeah! Like, man, what is this crazy place? My guess? The lair of the ghost bear. Like, he has a lot of junk for a ghost... or a bear. Not junk. Clues! What are those? Books on hypnotism. Hypnotic techniques and subliminal hypnosis. - Jackpot! - Ohh! I think we just found our first piece of evidence to get you guys off the hook with Kane. Evidence! Whoo-hoo-hoo! We love evidence. - Mwah! - Hey, gang. Check this out. Schematics for EMP. What's an EMP? What's a schematic? An EMP is an electromagnetic pulse. It's a device that can destroy electronics within its range. Urghh! Look what I found. This calendar has the date for WrestleMania circled in red. R.I.P. WWE. Fred! Evidence photos, velma. Can't have an investigation without evidence photos. So someone thinks they're going to knock the lights out on WrestleMania? Not on my watch! John! Gh-gh-ghost bear! Run! Yikes! Ohh! Whoa! Ohhh! Ah-ah-aaah! Huh?! We're right back where we started! Jinkies! And so's the ghost bear! Where are the boys?! We got to get the evidence! Don't worry, shaggy. I still have the photos. Yeah! No! - Yoinks! - Ahh! Guys, hold on to something. Aah... ohh? Ohh! Ah. Huh? Boom! Epic! Ah, enough already! Hey! Over there! Huh? Hey! What do you know? The caves are connected directly to the storm drains under WWE city. Giving that ghost bear full access at any time. So you see, Richards, that's how the ghost bear gets in and out of so many places so quickly. And we have reason to believe that whoever's behind these bear attacks, has planted an EMP device right here in the stadium. He could shut down the whole place right in the middle of WrestleMania. We shouldn't take any risks. We'll have to cancel the show. We can't cancel WrestleMania! That's like canceling Christmas. Not to mention my career. Besides, what could anyone gain but shutting off the lights? Not only the lights, but the TV cameras, too. There'd be no show. People would panic in the pitch black. They'd get hurt! You're right, sin Cara. It would tarnish the entire legacy of WWE. Listen. I'll have my men guard the stadium's generators 24/7. They'll check every square inch of the building right before the show. No one's going to get away with anything under my watch. One way or another, WrestleMania goes on. If the object of the EMP is to create chaos, you can bet that ghost bear is not going to be far away when it happens. I think we all know what we need to do. Run away? Nope. We've got to turn WrestleMania into a trap. A big bear trap. Whatever you plan, Fred, count me in. Come on, then. We don't have much time. Ladies and gentlemen, announcing a new match for tonight's event. Kane vs. Skinny man and dead meat. Like, do you think maybe the gang has solved the mystery yet? Because there's no mysteries to where we're going. Yeah. To the hospital. No. The morgue! Come on, guys, you got to have confidence. You have to get up there and give it your all! If you don't hold back; If you battle with your heart and soul, if you give everything you've got, then you'll not only survive this, you could win! Nice knowin' ya. Hey, uh... Break a leg, you two. Ooh! If we're lucky. Whoo-hoo! Let the games begin! Bring on the pain train! Whoo! This is going to be great! Yeah! So awesome! Everybody in position? Check. Sin Cara's ready. And so am I. Triple H? Ready out here. No chance that's what you got Welcome to WrestleMania! Allow me to show you why we're all here... bring it up. The WWE championship belt. The superstar who wins tonight's main event will be the new WWE champion. Jinkies! That's it. Fred, I know where the electromagnetic pulse device is. Tonight's first match is a big one, folks. We have the newcomers, skinny man and dead meat. - Ohh! - Ohh! They'll be facing the meanest competitor in and out of the ring. Back for revenge, determined to destroy anyone between him and the title. I give you the big, red monster. Kane! This is a last man standing match. The superstar who's unable to answer a ten count after being knocked down is declared the loser. Come on, scoob, we got... we got to keep it together! Oh... oh... K! After Kane is finished with skinny man and dead meat, we'll be scraping them off the mat with a spatula. And there's the bell. Kane explodes across the ring. Oh! There goes any chance for a fair match. Skinny man and dead meat... slam into the big red monster. Certainly that blow can only increase Kane's fury. Ohh! Miss Richards, you have to open the safe and check the championship belt! Are you crazy? Look, I checked the entire stadium for your electro-whatumacalit. It's not here! It's right there. Impossible. If only I had a magnet to prove it. Wow! Where did you get that? Luchadores... always ready for anything. Ok. Miss Richards, this magnet will prove that your championship belt isn't gold. Because if it sticks... Then it's made of iron and it's a fake. Caught in the clenches of Kane, the newcomers are done for. Whoa! The bounce out of the ring offers skinny man and dead meat a chance for escape... but look at this! Kane has just taken the match under the ring. It's bedlam down below! - Huh?! - Ahh! Not again! Somebody get me another desk out here, please. Ha ha! Jinkies! The EMP is about to go off. We'll never get it far enough away. The arena power generator is right below us. I've got to warn everyone. I have an idea. Hold this and let go when I say. Right... Ok. Now! Eeh! That wasn't supposed to happen. Huh? Whoa! Huh? What's going on? What happened? What happened to the TV?! Oh, man, this is awful! Who turned out the lights? Ok, guys, it's here. The fans are starting to panic. Plan B. Here we go. Whoo-hoo! Nice throw! We can see! Let there be light! Funkadelic. Part of the show? That was just part of the show! I was worried. - I'm fine now. - I'm ok! Scooby! You can do it. You know all the right moves. - I do? - Yeah! From the video game. I trust the massive power of your superstar-tastic dance moves. Just pretend you're playing the video game. I can do this. I can do this! That a boy, scoob! Huh?! Whoa! Ghost bear sighted. Good. He's here. Just like we thought he'd be. The lights are starting to go. Don't worry... Fred's on it. Triple H. Ok, guys, hit the generators. Huh? After a mysterious blackout, we're somehow back on the air. Hey! Dead meat's not dead yet. Wow, look at that doggy move. Go, dead meat! Freddy, go! Plan C. Hey, smokey! Where's the fire? Prepare to face the wrath of the bone bender! Is that a bear?! Like, zoinks! Is that ruben? Ruben, no! Whoa-oh-oh! Ohhh! I don't believe it, folks. Kane has been flattened, and a new competitor has entered the ring. But wait! Someone has activated the cage. Sin Cara and John cena are leaping into the ring. It's a cage match! Like, we're all doomed! Don't worry, shaggy. I'll protect you. The mysterious new competitor attacks the bear from behind, creating a distraction for cena to make a move. But this powerful creature turns the tables on them both. Now sin Cara stands alone. The fearless luchador attacks. He glides around the bear like lightning. The bear can't even touch sin Cara. Ladies and gentlemen, I haven't seen moves like this in the ring before. Sin Cara delivers a stunning blow to the bear while John cena recovers on the mat. He's going after the bear. Cena is lifting the bear over his head. And the bear is down. - Yeah! - Yay! Yes! What's that, bear, what's that? You can't see me! Ladies and gentlemen, here it is. Cena's vintage five knuckle shuffle. It's lights out for this big, bad bear. This match is over. Yay! Yay! Cena and sin Cara going for a tandem pin. Impossible! Huh? Ooh-hoo-hoo! Scooby-Doo, where are you?! This looks bad for skinny man. But wait, what is dead meat up to? Dead meat has revived Kane. The big, red monster has risen. Never before have we seen a stand-off like this. It's monster vs. Monster inside the cage at WrestleMania. Who will survive this supernatural match-up? Who will be victorious in this paranormal pandemonium? Kane drives the bear back with a stunning blow. The bear hits the mat. Kane pins down its leg. A new competitor, John cena and sin Cara pile onto the powerful creature, but they can barely hold it down. Scooby-Doo, it's up to you! Only dead meat can tip the balance now. Can he do it? Can dead meat save the day? Scooby Doobie Doo! Dead meat just delivered a gut-wrenching belly bomb and flattened the ring and exploded the cage! The dust is clearing now. The bear is out cold. Dead meat wins it! Whoo! Dead meat! That bear is toast! You ok, Velm? This... Is... Awesome! Whoo-hoo! Now let's see who this ghost bear really is. - Cookie?! - Cookie?! - Cookie?! - Uncle cookie! Why? WWE is your life. WWE was his life, but sadly, your Uncle cookie never got the glory... And his injury put him out of the spotlight. Permanently. He started to truly resent WWE because he knew he could never be the champion he always dreamed of being. That resentment grew into hatred over the years, as he trained others to be what he could not. That's when he developed his plan for revenge. But that wouldn't be enough. He needed a pawn to steal the championship belt. That's when he devised the idea of hacking into a video game and placing post-hypnotic suggestions into it. That game would become part of a contest, which cookie set up with fake emails he sent throughout WWE. That's why he used the bear to attack your video game studio. To cover his tracks. The contest assured that only the most skilled pawn would arrive at WWE city to aid in the theft. Cookie then used flashing lights to activate Scooby's post-hypnotic programming. When cookie identified the belt in Scooby's bed as the championship belt, he was lying. He'd already switched them. With Scooby taking the blame, cookie was free to carry out his ultimate plan. Which was to turn out the lights, and with the help of the bear, create so much panic and injury... That WrestleMania would be completely ruined and WWE would never recover. But thanks to Fred here, we got the lights back on pretty quick. Good work! Ah, um, thanks. And the real championship belt, where is it now? Elementary, my dear Mr. McMahon. Cookie's wearing it. Sorry, cookie. But the championship belt isn't for cheaters, it's for champions. Good call, hiring these kids, sir. I thought they might come in handy. Just get cookie out of here! Yes, sir, will do, sir, you bet. A championship belt was the icing on the cake, Mr. McMahon. Cookie could live off its golden jewels for the rest of his life. Boo! And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids and your giant, crazy dog! I guess after what my Uncle's done, you won't be wanting me around anymore. - Not so, Ruby. - You're one of us now. You got the funk, son! That's right, ruben. You've shown a superstar spirit in the ring, and at the computer. You've earned a place with us in whatever you want to do. The choice is yours. Thanks, Mr. McMahon. Now that we have the real championship belt, it needs to be awarded to true champions. And after what I've seen tonight, they're right here. Skinny man and dead meat! - Really? - Huh? Well done. Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Scooby-Doo! Scooby Doobie Doo!
