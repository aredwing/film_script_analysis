There's no way she can outrun a vampire. Oh, don't listen to her, Betsy. You can do it. Don't give up. Are we there yet? Not for a few more hours, Bonnie. You can go back to sleep. Help! Open the door! No one can help you now, Betsy. - Boring! - Patience. All great horror films start slowly. You see, they're designed... Please, let me in! Tactics, Betsy, tactics. Look for something to defend yourself with! There we go. Oh, technically, that'll be useless. Everybody knows a wooden stake through the heart is the only way to kill a vampire! Only a kitty cat. Classic misdirection. A cat? Come on, guys, this isn't scary. Whoa! Help! Get me out of here! - Jessie! - We have to get her out! Jessie! Jessie, can you hear me? Okay, everyone, on three. One, two, three! Jessie? Jessie! What's the matter with Jessie? She was abandoned in a box for years. I couldn't... I couldn't find a way out. Mom, can I bring my toys? The roadside motel is one of the most common locales for a horror film. Remote, isolated, ordinary. A comforting environment to allay the suspicions of the audience. I expect they'll be asking the innkeeper to use the telephone any minute now. Would it be okay if I used your phone? Our car has a flat. Right on cue. It's okay, Jessie. You're safe now. We'll be back on the road before you know it. What's the latest, Trixie? Uh, she's still on the phone with the tow truck company. 6:00 a.m.? That's the earliest you can get here? 6:00 a.m.? You mean we have to stay here all night? Bum, bum, bum I don't care where we are as long as I'm not stuck alone in that box. If you could just sign here in the guestbook. I'll need to see a major credit card for the incidentals. Okay, let's see here. I'm going to put you in room seven. You know, we have a little saying around here, at the Sleep Well Motel, you're gonna sleep well. Well, it looks like they're asleep. Finally. Potato Head, where are you... Where are you going? We're at a motel. I just wanna check out the amenities. You know, the free stuff? Little soaps, shower caps, shampoo? Conditioner? Oh, I wouldn't go out there if I were you. The first to leave usually gets it. Oh, Potato Head, don't leave the bag. A motel is one of the easiest places for a toy to get lost! Aw, shut your worry hole! Nobody's gonna getting lost. Besides, I promised Hamm I'd bring him back something nice. Wait. Where are you guys going? We were just gonna check out the free stuff. And if something does happen to the potato, I wouldn't want to miss it. Aw, come on, guys! Let's all just stay in the bag. Buzz, I'll grab those guys. You get Potato Head. - Got it. - No, wait. Don't go! Don't worry, Jessie. I'll be right back. Buzz! Guys! Guys, where are you? Jessie, what's wrong? Are you okay? Buzz, where is everybody? Not to worry. We're all right here. See, there's Woody, Pricklepants, Trixie, Rex... Wait. Where's Potato Head? And so it begins. Ah! Pricklepants, you're not helping! I'm just saying it's quite common in these types of movies for one unsuspecting character to wander off and vanish. Well, he couldn't have just disappeared. Maybe this place is haunted. What? It's haunted? Of course not. Everybody knows ghosts aren't real. Actually, according to my Internet research... Highly unlikely. There has to be a rational explanation. We need to break into groups of two. Everyone, keep an eye on your partner. If anything goes wrong, give a yell. Eww! I stepped in something. Wait a minute. Hmm. What is it? Disgusting. Well, were this a movie, I'd say it was slime from the creature's metamorphosis. Yeah, well, whatever it is, Potato Head managed to step in it, leaving behind a trail of footprints. If we follow it, it should lead us right to him. - Hey, guys! - No, wait! Trixie, don't! Trixie! - Trixie? - Potato Head! And this would be the threshold. Every movie has one, you know. Once the heroes enter, there's no turning back. - Rex, hurry! - Coming! Now we just need to find a way down. Well, that did the job. Sorry! Ah. Sorry. Is everyone okay? That way! All right, everybody, stay close. Blech! So what happens now? Well, this would be the part where the characters get separated and then picked off one by one... Then what happens next? Ah! Uh, where's Pricklepants? Well, he was standing right here just a moment ago. What are we gonna do now? He was the only one who knew what the heck was going on... Wait, wait, listen! I think we lost it. It's over there! Over here! I think I can see it. It's staring right at us. It's Potato Head's arm! Wait a minute. It looks like it's trying to tell us something. What is it, little buddy? Think he's using some kind of hand signals. It's the number one! No, no. One letter! Uh, one syllable? Uh, once upon a time! Uh, one plus one is one! I think maybe it's pointing up. - Up. Of course. - Yeah. Hmm... Pass me the hand, will you? What now? Out the door and to the right. What? Are you sure? The hand looks like it's pointing left to me. Psst! Over here. Huh? What? Look over here. Hello? Hello? Sure, if you hold it that way. Hey guys, Wait up! Woody! Buzz! Shh! Quiet, soldier! You'll lead them right to us. This place isn't safe for toys. Combat Carl is gonna take his hand away now. You yell, we're done for. Got it? Mmm-hmm. Combat Carl's seen things, horrible things. Combat Carl's learned you gotta keep movin', or else they find you! Are you Combat Carl? The only thing that's kept Combat Carl going is the thought he might see his owner Billy just one more time. You better turn back now, or you'll never see your owner again! But I need to find my friends! This is what happens when you try to find your friends! Shh! Did you hear that? It found us. We're trapped! Nah, Combat Carl never gives up. Combat Carl finds a way. We gotta move. You ready? - What? No! - We're going on three. One, two, three! Grab my arm! Carl, wait! Carl! Forget about Combat Carl! Just go! Huh? Hey! Let me go, you big varmint! Let me go this instant! Thank you. Well, it's been fun. Hmm. Looks old. Yeah, probably worth something. Excellent find, Mr. Jones. Aw. He's gone. All clear! Jessie! Buzz! I'm so glad you're safe. Nice to see you made it here in one piece, cowgirl. Carl! Oh, uh, Combat Carl would like to introduce you to his one-third-scale counterpart, Combat Carl Jr. Ma'am. Sorry to break up the party, but we're on a tight schedule. Pocketeer, you're up! Pockets away! Lego Bunny, go! - Any sign of our guy or the lizard? - No, sir. Area is still clear. Hey, Old Timer, how we doin'? Well, sir, he's been gone for, oh, 90 seconds. I reckon he could be back any minute. Okay, let's try this again! Third time's the charm. You can do it, Junior. Steady. Take it easy now. Almost got it! Whoa! - Oh, no! - Good grief! Sassafras! That was the last one. That means I'm next! Don't you see? I'm the last of the Fastener Four! Look! Zipper Man, Snaps, Speed Lacer. I'm next. I'm next! I'm next! Keep it together, man! We'll find a way out. Oh, we'll get out, all right. - In boxes. - What? Jessie, nobody's getting boxed up. We're leaving together. You have a sale. Pez Cat, what do you see? Uh, it's hard to make out, but it looks like a cowboy. Let's see what's next to go. What? $2,000? Jones! Jones, you're not gonna believe this! Happy trails, Cowboy Andy. It's like taking candy from a baby. He'll be able to get out, won't he? I haven't got the foggiest idea. What started out as a classic horror film has turned into something more of a tragedy. I can't believe we're never gonna see Bonnie again. Combat Carl would have liked to have seen Billy just... one more time. We'll find a way, Carl. We'll find a way. Well, you better hurry, Sergeant. Sun's fixin' to rise any minute now. You have a sale. People, back to your positions! All right. Come on, big money! Who is it this time? Okay, I'm looking. I'm looking. Oh, my gosh, he's getting up! Jonesy, Jonesy, we got another gold mine! Looks like you get to go on a little trip. Yeah, you got a guest with a flat tire that needs fixing? Absolutely. Come on. I'll show you the way. Okay, kids, he's gone! It's no use! I'm not tall enough! I'll go get Woody. Together we'll be able to reach the handle. - Good plan, Jessie. - Someone's at the door! Yeah, so that big stack there and the ones on the counter all go, too. Okay. Looks like I'm gonna have to take two trips. Woody! All right, we need a plan B. Put on your thinking caps, people. I got it! She can make a break for the delivery truck. Aw, it's broad daylight. Besides, she'll never make it in time. What do I do? Now we're all gonna end up in a box. Wait. That's it! Jessie, say that again! Say what? That we're all gonna end up in boxes? Not us, you. You're gonna get in a box. What? Listen, in a few minutes, the delivery lady is gonna come back through that door and take the other boxes, and you're gonna be in one of 'em. It's the only way to free Woody. No. No way. I can't. I can't do that! I can't get in a box. I can't! There's gotta be another way. This is the way! You better snap out of it, soldier! We're running out of time, and you're the only chance we've got! No! I can't! Jessie, listen to me. Remember your training. But I don't have any training! Well, forget about that. When Combat Carl gets stuck in a jam, he says to himself, "Combat Carl never gives up. Combat Carl finds a way." Now say it! Combat Carl never gives up? Combat... You're not Combat Carl! Oh, Jessie never gives up. Jessie finds a way. I can't hear you! Jessie never gives up! Jessie finds a way! Yeah! Oh, one more thing. Keep it down. I'll try. Wake up! You're free! Who dares summon Transitron? I need to use this box. Transitron free? Yes, that's right. Here, give me your hand. What the... How can I ever repay you? Seal me in. Uh... Okay, here goes. Uh-huh. Okay. Wait, wait. Don't tape it! I won't be able to get out! Just close the flaps and put that box on top. It'll keep it shut. Are you sure about this? No, not really. By Globbatron's ghost, you shall be remembered! - All right. - Transitron, separate! Need anything else? Well, the plan seems to be working. So far, so good. Oh, forgot the tape again? What? No, do... She got sealed in! Aw, that's it. We're never gonna get outta here. Nah. Jessie never gives up. Jessie finds a way. You're good to go. Thank you so much. Don't forget your bag, Bonnie. We're leaving in two minutes. Excuse me. Coming through. Oh! Jessie never gives up. Jessie finds a way. Jessie never gives up. Jessie finds a way. Jessie never gives up. Jessie finds a way. Jessie never gives up. Jessie finds a way. Jessie never gives up... Jessie finds a way! Woody! Woody! Jessie! Jessie, over here! Oh, it's been a while. I don't think she's coming back. Patience. Cinematic structure dictates it's always darkest... Can it, Pants! Life ain't a movie. They're never coming back. Look! They're coming back! - Hooray! Yeah! - Yeah, she did it! Checking out? I hope you enjoyed your stay. We did. Thanks. Come on, Jess! Let's move! Mom, are we going to Grandma's now? - In a minute, honey. - Bonnie! Okay, now climb on my shoulders, and then we'll... Jessie? Jessie! Gah! What is she doing? She's headed straight for the curtain! That's not part of the plan. Jessie! Come on. MY hand! See? Told you. Perfect! I can't look. Come and get it! Thanks for staying with us at the Sleep Well. My toys! No, no. Little girl, that area is for employees only! Hey! I can't have you back here. Are those my daughter's toys? Jessie! Those, uh, they might be hers. This was just an honest mistake. You know, I really should call the police. The police? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on. There's no need to involve the authorities. Come on, Bonnie. Let's go. We're leaving. Would you consider selling them? Tell you what. I'll give you $100 for the cowboy. What do you want? $200? Ah, the epilogue. We're back to the location where it all began. I never thought I'd miss the trunk. You did it, Jessie. You saved us all. Jessie didn't give up. Jessie found a way. Well, Woody wants to say thanks. Potato Head! Have you seen Potato Head? What? No! Oh, dear. It seems the monster has returned to claim one final victim. No, he hasn't. He's right over there. Oh, I'm so glad to have you back, baby. We ain't never gonna get separated again. Aw, nuts. Ah, group laughter. A sure sign that the worst is behind us and the movie is just about over. So, this is the ending? Um, yes. I'd say they'd be running the credits about now. Transport has arrived! You heard the cat. Let's move. Thanks, buddy. Next stop, Billy's house. Mr. Jones! Here you go, buddy. Uh, welcome to the Sleep Well. How may I... Are you the manager? Me? No, I'm not the manager. I'll tell you what. I'll go get him for you. Told you not to leave the keys in the car. We got a runner.
