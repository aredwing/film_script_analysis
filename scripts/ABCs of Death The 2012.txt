It's one of the reasons We implemented the infant sterilization act. Still, every citizen has the right To earn back their fertility permits. The fastest route has always been Through service to propagation control. Oh yes, sir, it's why I joined-- That and making the world a safer place, of course. Of course. Why do you want children? - Propagation control... - ( robot clanking ) You are charged with acts of terror through illegal propagation. You are hereby ordered to surrender all contraband.

We just killed a child. - ( beeping ) - oh, it wasn't alive to begin with. Not by law. Hmm. The rebels were delivering the child To the vatic, "prophet" of all mentals. With such power, his very existence threatens humanity, But, once we've reanimated And bio-vac'd every last bit of brain matter, We may finally ascertain his location. A fine achievement, officer. You see, the agency has a far greater purpose than its... ( sniffs, exhales sharply ) "public position." You've given ten years of service to your unit, officer. Your records are excellent. I'm pleased to say that your permits have been approved. Sir... ( laughs ) - Yes, sir. Uh... - I'm not finished... While your permits are approved, There are biological factors beyond the agency's control. Reanimate the infant. - ( inhales sharply ) - ( gun humming ) I can't let you do this. - Nezbit, officer lainey has clearly been compromised. - ( whirring ) Arrest her. I won't let you re-murder a child. Oh, grow up! ( nezbit whirs down ) ( grunting ) Stoker: Better a cruel truth than a comfortable delusion. Sir... Sir, the baby is... Where'd he go? ( footsteps pattering ) Sir? Did you hear that? ( screams ) It's a mental, idiot! Shoot for the head! Oh, shit... ( panting ) Oh, such vitality... Mmm! I'll keep the corpse alive for weeks... Wasn't taking him to the prophet. Farm every burning neuron... He is the prophet. Feast on his pain. Mental: Take him...

If you can see, over my head, The most oddest looking colored gases. Uh, they're like chemtrails, I guess, And they seem to be followed by other planes and copters, and a general sense... - 'w'! - ...Of panic seems to have hit the area. Believe it or not, nancy, we're actually getting reports Of people seeing clown zombies in the streets. Fuckin' clown zombies? That's fucking stupid! What are they looking for? Magnets? 'w'? I just... Is that a 'w' on there? What's up with these 'w's? Is this some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, As we watch the horror Of our own minds Pushing humanity toward extinction? Can we live in a world That is more immoral than our own brains, - Our own ideas... - No! Don't open the door! We live in a process that is already infested, Already mutated, already over! - Already blank... - ( screaming ) ...From a wave of congealed confidence! ( echoing ) my elbows are untouchable!! My elbows are sharp!! I am transparent. I am solid in the form of this new liberty reborn! You are invisible in this new world! I hover above you... Above as below. I am legion.
