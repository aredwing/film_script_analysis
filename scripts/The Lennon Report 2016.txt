What good did it do? I do not agree with the cuts that were made by the congress. I believe we should be going toward with the b-1 bomber program. I think we should be going toward with the trident submarine program to keep pace with Russia. The electoral votes for president Reagan say it all. The liberal era is over. - Early speculation is that Reagan's business-friendly politics will be a boon to economic recovery. - The police raided a home in the Bronx today, arresting several members of the black panthers. - Crime rates continue to rise with unemployment in New York lingering at ten percent.

Your mail, Mr. Weiss. - Thank you. - What's in it? - A letter. - But... what's it about? - Not sure. Jeff, you shouldn't worry about that. It's most likely a letter from his o.B.G.Y.N. Determining that he is in fact a hermaphrodite. - Oh, you're a real mind reader, Neil! I wrote that one myself! Are you gonna open it? - Yeah, I'm gonna look at it later, buddy. - Is my jacket in here? - No! - Well what the hell is it anyway? Honestly, Jeff, I told you about it. Are you not aware what a hermaphrodite is? - Don't you have work to do for the eleven besides being a pain in the ass? - Nope. I saw the logo. - Oh, you saw the logo? - I saw the logo! - Okay, great. - Yes. I interviewed for a position at CNN. -What? Why? - Why the hell would you want to work for a station that only does the news? I need all three of these, actually. - I mean, 24/7! - She needs those! Do you know what that's going to do to our social life? - Our social life? - Yes! - Here you go. I double- checked those for ya. We are number one. Why would you want to leave a good thing? - Did you see the first hour of CNN back in June? - Do you know what they covered in the first half hour alone? - Was it during dynasty? I'll tell ya. They covered the assassination attempt of Vernon Jordan, the Lax Faa safety standards, and a presidential address from Jimmy Carter. Not only are they covering good stories, but they are doing it live. - So this was during dynasty? - Exactly. - When was the last time you had a live presidential address on the eleven? On the six for that matter? - It doesn't make sense. There's a line out the door for your job! - We used to cover stories that drove social change. Now, we're just covering stories that drive advertising. Not really with that, so... I would love to explain further but I gotta book it. - What, you gotta go to the Freddie Mercury look-a-like contest your taking your date to? - Is that where you're coming for the eleven? Is that your lead story? - We haven't decided yet. - How'd you know I had a date? - Every time you try and impress a woman, you do this thing. You go for cash but it comes out like... cruisin'. - Jeff, have a good one. Phil, I'll have your mother home by, what, is one good? One's good. - No, she gets sleepy by midnight, Alan. - Good, so 11:59 it is. Oh, hey, and Phil? Seriously, come here. - And... here it is. - Come on, it's a power struggle. Get over here. - Yes, Alan, what could you possibly want? - Let's go. A twenty-dollar donation, please? I just bought a bike, you know it. - Is that all that my mother's worth? -It's just twenty dollars. -I'm ashamed of you. - Okay, don't work to hard. - Don't you run this place? -Yeah. - Hey, Jeff, we need to deduct twenty dollars from your next paycheck. - Wait, what? - That drive culminated in a John Smith field goal attempt for 52 yards. -How you feelin'? I meant physically. - You're allowed to have ice chips. I'll get them for ya, if you let me hang around and watch the game with ya for a bit. All right, I'll be right back - hey, come on inside and warm up for a little bit. Come on. Let's go. - You don't care who wins as long as the patriots lose. -What's he thinkin'? -Hello? Anyone gonna get that? Hello, this is Dr. Halleran. - Hey Dr. Halleran, it's Sato. We were wondering if you could help us with some paperwork. Only if you have a minute. - Sure, DEA, how can I help you? - What's... eight letters long and home team of the orange bowl? - Hi, Barbara. Almost forgot what day it was. - You know the times does this specifically for us. -It's the dolphins. -Oh. - It's dolphins. Thanks, Dave. You got it. Good luck with the rest of your "paperwork." I've got to get back to work. - Yeah, I'm sure general surgery is swamped. -Oh. Who's winning the game? -The dolphins. - That's your answer for everything. -Bye, Barb. - Playin' dumb always worked for me. Receiving a priority in the 2-0.

Try to get a description of the perp. - 2-0 boy. Show me going. Show me on the back. Good, let Spiro and Cullen get there first. - Probably just some punk kid shootin' fireworks in central park. - I'm think I'm a shoe in for the job. What do you think? -I hate you. - I'm guessing you're really going to hate me when I'm your boss. - Let's see you handle a field assignment first, Skippy. - Skippy? I've been here for five years. -Shh. Shh. Hold on. All units redirect to 72nd and central park west - 72nd and central park west? That's... the Dakota. -That could be something. - Or it could be a movie star falling down a flight of stairs. - I'll go either way... - Not a chance, but if the cops are all in, so are we. Where the hell's my radio? -I don't know. - Mr. Clark, where's my radio? - I don't know! - Well, then, go get it! Please! Don't run. Fly! You're still there! I need it. Send all available units to 72nd and central park west. Immediately. Don't tell Jeff I know where my radio is. - Freeze! Hands up! Against the wall! Move! You have the right to an attorney... - 2-0 Adam. Show me 84. Confirmed male shot. Victim is likely. Multiple gun shot wounds. Put a rush on the bus. Hey buddy, you okay? Relax, you were just in an accident, okay? - Alright? You know your name? - It's Alan. - Great. You know where you are? -The park? - Alright, I'm gonna let these guys do their job, alright? Okay, did anyone see the accident? - You okay, buddy? - Go get the scoop. -Pete, what's the story? - Single perp in custody, missing weapon, victim's in a bad way. -What's "a bad way?" - Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. - Where's the victim? - In the vestibule. -This is a mess.

Central, transporting victim to Roosevelt hospital. Let's get him up. - Damn. - Hey, officer? - Yeah? - Can you give us a hand real quick? - What's the problem? - We dug into the ground. -Are you kidding? Alright. - Pull like hell, just don't drop him, okay? One, two, three. - I've got to go back to work. - I'm going to be okay, huh? - You're fine, Mr. Weiss. We're almost at the hospital. - My right hip. Is it broken? Did you see if it's broken? You are just in a little bit of shock. Just lay back down and focus on your breath. - You know, I had a date tonight. - Really? - Yeah. - Good luck explaining this one. You better hope for some scars to back this up. - Yeah, I definitely could have used this excuse once or twice. - You picked a good night to do this. The e.D. Should be empty tonight. - Oh good. - Oh yeah. - The doctor on call? She'll make you forget about your date and busted up leg. - Really? - Really? - She gets me going. Anything going on tonight? It's quiet. What's this? -I baked for your birthday. - You know damn well it's not my birthday. - Alright, maybe I just felt like baking. - Your old pal, Eddie kazoo, wandered into the waiting area to warm up earlier, but Medina chased him out. - Oh, no, I just bribed him with pie to come back in. - Gives Medina something to do. I swear, he thinks a couple of bums coming in to warm up is the fall of Saigon. - Something you want to talk about? - He just drives me a little crazy is all. If he tells me, "it's officer Medina," one more time, I'm going to turn his office into a homeless shelter. -Maybe he just likes you. - Do a crossword puzzle. Roosevelt hospital e.D. Sato speaking. This is the 20th precinct. We have officers bringing in a gun shot victim. -Get David down here. Ok, give me all the details. Hi it's Barbara, can you page Dr. David Halleran to emergency department. Paging doctor Halleran to the emergency department. - Is this the gunshot? I thought they left without you. No, accident in the park. -Check him in with the clerk. I'll take him. - Alright. A doctor will be with you in a bit. - You're not the doctor? Why can't you be the doctor? - Like I said. A doctor will be with you in a bit. -Think about it. Mr. Weiss? -Doctor? - I don't know if I should treat you or plant you. What happened? - I was hit by a taxi riding my motorcycle. Guess who won? - Well... It's a good thing you're still alive. And being conscious is a good sign. Let's start with where it hurts, hm? - It hurts everywhere so maybe we should get some help from that nurse that brought me in? She can help out? - Kammerer? Ha! Good luck with that one, honey. - I should say the same to you. - Nuh-uh. Ain't happenin'. Take a deep breath. - You still stuck on that crossword? - Hardly, we have a patient coming in with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. - Alright, what are his vitals? - I don't know. - No word from the ambulance? - The ambulance was a block away when police dispatch called. They said the police are bringing him in. - The police are bringing him in? - He's hitting the door right now. - Why would they do that if the ambulance is a block away? - Maybe it's just that bad. - Let me poke around here. Let me know what hurts, okay? - That hurt? Oh, that's a yes. Mind if I take a look? - Go ahead. Move, move! Come on, move! Trauma 115. - I'm going to see if I can help out in there, okay?

What's his name? -John Lennon. -No. - He's carrying John Lennon's wallet. - It doesn't look like him. - He could be a pick pocket, he could have a fake ID, - I don't care if he's pope John Paul, it's our job to keep him alive. - Got it. - Got it, Barb? -Let's crack the chest. - Can someone page a respiratory therapist? - Give me the thoracotomy tray. -Hey, Barb! - Let security know we may have a situation in here. Excuse me. - What do you need? -Who's in there? - A gunshot victim. - But who? He can't stay. Stay warm, but don't come back in here, okay? -We may have a situation. - What kind of situation requires Mr. kazoo's presence in this hospital? - Forget about kazoo. A very important person has been rushed into our trauma room. Just keep an eye out for anything unusual. - Unusual? Right. - Please. - How important are we talking about here? - Bigger than we're equipped for. All right? -Hi, it's Barbara again. Can you page us a respiratory therapist? Thanks. - The shooting occured around 10:45. Multiple shots to the back with a thirty-eight. -Medical history? -No idea. -Patient's name? - John Doe - John Doe. - Hey. Come here. - Yes? - Can you do me a favor? I'm Alan, I'm Alan. - What's your name? - Santos. -Nice to meet you, Santos. Do you watch eye witness news? -Ah, Geraldo Rivera! - Yes, I work for eye witness news. Alright, so could you do me a favor. Here's my card. Here's twenty dollars. - Ok. - Call that number. Whoever answers, just tell them, "Alan Weiss is in the hospital and John Lennon may have been shot." - "Alan Weiss shot John Lennon." - No, no. I'm Alan Weiss. I didn't shoot anyone. John Lennon? - Si, Si Si. - "Alan Weiss is in the hospital and John Lennon may have been shot." -Aye, Mio! - Can you do that quickly? - No problemo. -Stop mopping and sweeping. Where is my husband? -He's in surgery right now. -I need to see him. - I'm sorry, you can't see him. They are working on him right now. - What's happening? Is he alright? - I can't say. A doctor will talk to you as soon as they are done. They'll have the best information. -I'll just wait. - I can put you in a private waiting area until the doctor can talk to you. -Give me drapes. Give him twenty blade. Let's get them in there! - Move quickly! - Let's get an incision. - Can I make a phone call, please? -Of course you can. That sounds great. Let's do it one more time. This time, let's wait a few bars before you come in with the the vocals. - Hey, David! -Hold on one sec. Hello? -John's been shot. -John's been what? Yoko. Talk to me. What's happening? - David, I don't know what to do. I'm alone. I'm surrounded by strangers. I just need a familiar face. I need to get home to Sean.

Alan Weiss? -Yeah? - Staff isn't allowed to make personal calls on behalf of the patients. - Well technically this isn't a personal phone call. - Mr. Weiss, we have a situation here so I'm gonna need you to lie quiet. - Who's in there? Is that John Lennon? - Mr. Weiss I asked you to lie quiet here and not get in the way of what's going on. - I'm not trying to get in the way. If you don't want to tell me, that's fine. You can shake your head, yes? No? That's all I need. If that's John Lennon, people have the right to know. - And if it's not, they don't have a right to know? Or if it's not, you just don't care? -That's not what I meant. -All right. - Eye witness news, right? Channel 7? -Yeah. - I don't know who the hell is in there, and frankly, I don't care. The only thing I care about is that you lie here. Quietly. Thank you, Mr. Weiss. - How about my twenty dollars? - Dispatch. Victim delivered to Roosevelt. - Custody turned over to the hospital's emergency staff. - Victim means crime. I need everyone who isn't absolutely committed at the Dakota to get to Roosevelt. Find out who they just brought in. Phil, I can get to Roosevelt. - No, if everyone is out in the field then no one is here to help me get this on the air. Jeff, this might be going on air. I'm not going to do this alone. -Where is he? - He is in room 115, Dr. marks. Rib spreader. Dick? What are you doing here? - Did they tell you who that is? -Is it really him? -Yes, that's John Lennon. - I just escorted Yoko Ono to an empty OBgyn room. We should call Dr. Lynn. After the incision is spread I'm gonna need to call and update him on this situation. - DEA, could you follow up with that respiratory therapist please? - I don't think anybody is coming, Pam. - Blood is pooling in the thoracic chamber. Can't see the heart. -Scissors. - I'm going to deliver the heart. -Delivering the heart. Are you sensing any organized cardiac activity? -Beginning cardiac massage. Get suction. - in the aorta resuming respiration. Do we see any circulation? No. Still nothing. - Nurse, I need a pediatric feeding tube, a catheter, and an 10 blade. - Dr. marks, what are you doing? -A Vietnam line. We saved a lot of lives with these in the war. Right leg? - I was never in combat, what does that mean? - I'm going to do a cutdown on the greater saphenous vein and catheterize the vein. -And the feeding tube? - Big tube. It carries a lot of blood, and fast. - Dr. marks, my patient is in a delicate state. Are you sure an incision medically necessary? - You need circulation. I'm giving it to you. - What are you doing? - I'm making a phone call. -No you're not. - I can't make my own phone call now? You listen to me very carefully. Okay? I am leaving this hospital. You have no legal right to hold me here. - You're not going anywhere. - Oh no? Oh, perfect! You see how he's manhandling me? -I got this. - Just make sure he gets back to his spot. He's all yours. - Okay. All right. - You see that?! - Mr. Weiss, you were so beat up we had to take the stretcher apart to get you in here. What are you doing? -Don't you know? -Know what? -He's been shot. -Who's been shot? -John Lennon. - John Lennon's been shot? Who told you that? - Well, no one told me directly but - I heard two cops say that... I could've sworn they said his name. - Alan, I've got a radio right here. If John Lennon was shot, I think I'd know about it. - So, he's not shot? - No. Can I get you back to your bed? - He's not shot. - Come on. Let's go. - Can I just make a phone call, please? I've been here for a while. People are probably worried. Just a minute. I won't get you in trouble. Just one call. -Sure. - Here. - Thanks. -Newsroom. -Phil, it's Alan. - Please tell me you won the Mercury contest? - I got into a motorcycle accident. - I knew you were gunna dump that thing. He got into an accident. Yeah, so you're okay, right? - I think I'm fine I'm at the hospital. - Wait, what hospital? Roosevelt? -Yeah. Listen to me. I think John Lennon's been shot. Shut up. Shut up! Jesus, Alan. I just heard the cops call for an ambulance to the Dakota and another call saying a victim has just been transported to Roosevelt. - Phil, that's the third part. I heard his name, I think I've seen Yoko Ono and if your telling me they called for an ambulance for the Dakota. It's gotta be John Lennon. John Lennon's shot and he's in this hospital. - Okay, we have crews at the Dakota and Roosevelt. Now we've got you inside. What is his condition? - Phil, I'm no doctor but I know you can't have no circulation and be living. -How certain are you? -Hello? Hello? - I was in the middle of an important call. - This phone is for hospital use only. Get back to your bed. - Alan? No! - Everyone! Put everything down! - I'm sorry ma'am, it's my fault. I'll help him back to his bed. -Thank you. - Come on. - You just don't do that. So much for your radio. -Okay, come on. Is that really John Lennon in there? - Can I please get a pen and piece of paper? - Alan. You called it in. Why don't you relax and let who ever you called handle it? - And I'm sure they will but my job doesn't end with a phone call. History's being made in there, my man. The "give peace a chance" guy just got gunned down. If that's not a story worth telling, then I don't know what is. - Alright, a couple pieces of notebook paper work for you? You didn't get that from me. Hello. -Hi, Tamara, it's DEA. Sorry to call so late but it's important. - It's fine. He's up watching the game. Hang on, I'll go get him. For me? -Yeah, it's DEA. -Alright, I got it. Thanks. -Yeah, DEA, what is it? - Hey, who were you on the phone with? - Depends on how much you heard. - Look, I need to know what you're up to out here. - Do ya? - Yeah. - What's going on in there? Is he gonna make it? What happened to him? - Why do you care? Who are you? - It doesn't matter who I am now, does it? Why don't you go back inside and do your job? I'll do mine. - I need some information from you. - Here's my information. You can keep it, too. -Jesus. Medina! -Roosevelt hospital. I need more visualization. Can you switch out the gauze? - The aorta seems to be intact. - Are you seeing any injuries or bullet wounds to the heart? - There's no injury but the heart is empty. - He's hit in the lung... - It's gotta be an artery but I can't see it. Maybe if we get more circulation, I can find it. I need more blood going in there faster. - There's arterial bleeding but I cannot visualize the pulmonary artery or the subclavian. Stuart, call the blood bank and get more blood. -Come on... Hello? - Bob, it's Phil with WABC in New York. - Hey, Phil, what's going on? - Bob, I have a reporter from the six o'clock news who's at Roosevelt hospital right now reporting that John Lennon's been shot dead. -Jesus. - Okay. So what do you need from me? - Well, we'd like to break in. - Are you kidding me? We got a tie game. We are headed into overtime. Come on, Phil, I wanna help you, I do. Maybe I could do a flash but who's his source? Have you gotten confirmation from the hospital? - He is, Bob. He's the goddamn source. He witnessed it. He's there! I've got no confirmation from the hospital but I did confirm a shooting at the Dakota. Bob, we're out in front of everybody on this. We can break this story. - We're heading into overtime. I'm not gonna have Howard interrupt the broadcast to report a story that could turn out to be false. Are you crazy? - Call Roone Arledge. He'll give you the go ahead. No, no, no! Howard, if you're listening in the booth, I'm going to call you in a few minutes with a story. - I'm hearing good breath sounds. He doesn't need the chest tube. - Barb, get the heart rate monitor. - We don't have one in here. - Get one. -Why? -I think felt a beat. - Roone, hey! It's Bob. Sorry to call you so late. But I just got a call from Phill in the news room in New York and he may have one hell of a breaking story. Where's the heart rate monitor? - What's going on? - David may have felt a pulse. - Your friend is from eye witness news. - Get Medina. - I can't find him. - Get David the heart rate monitor. I'll find Medina. If New York is confirming that we can break this story, we have to have Howard flash it. -Jesus. Interrupt the broadcast. Alright, I'll have Howard flash it. Absolutely interrupt. Bob, what's happening? What's going on? What is going on?! -Dr. Lynn. - Come with me. There is going to be chaos on the streets outside. Reporters, photographers, fans are going to do whatever they can to get into this building. Get all your men in here. Call more in if you have to. - I'll call the precinct for help. -Perfect. - Should I route the press into the Winston lobby or keep them at bay out on the street? - The lobby works. Tell everybody that's where the official statement's gonna be and listen to me... I want you to check every person. Verify their identification. No one gets in without credentials. -Doctor. We've got it. - David? Monitor's on. Start compression. -Medina. - Shh. Officer Medina. Just wait. Do me a favor. Keep an eye on those two bozos, huh? NYPD 20th precinct. - Hey, this is officer Medina, I'm gonna need some assistance with crowd control over at Roosevelt hospital. - We have some officers from our precinct there already. - Yeah, we feel that's not enough. We can't have the streets blocked preventing ambulances from going through. - Buddy, we got a scene that we are dealing with at the Dakota right now. A potential problem isn't our main priority. We're doing our best. - Well right now your best ain't cutting it. - I'll send as many guys as I can spare, when I can spare them. -What's up? - We've got a journalist. In the e.D. And right next to that high profile patient I told you about. -Alan Weiss, I know. - You know? You chase bums out of the waiting room for warming up, and you knowingly left the press outside of a VIP's room? - Take it easy, I'll take care of it. - Do your fucking job. - Jesus Christ. - Listen, I need someone removed from the e.D. One Alan Weiss. Now? - Yeah, get it done. -Weiss. Lay down. - No, I'm good sitting here. Doctor said that she'd be back in a minute. - Oh? Lay down. - This is not how you treat your patients! - You've been admitted into the hospital. They'll take care of you there and you are not to return to the emergency department for any reason whatsoever. -Bob, what's going on? - Howard, listen, John Lennon was just shot outside the Dakota in New York. - How long have we been at this? -Quite a while. I know you knew him and I'm sorry. This is unfortunate, but this is big. And Roone wants you to do the news flash. Bob, I've got a tie game here! - Dr. Halleran, are you seeing any progress? Dr. Halleran, is the patient responding to internal cardiac compressions? -No, still nothing. - Howard, let's go with them on this one. Okay? -Thanks. What was that all about? -John Lennon. He was shot outside of his apartment. -Oh boy. Are there any other measures available to us? - If we can find the source of the blood loss right now, we still have a chance. - Fellas, I just don't know. I'd like your opinion. I can't see this game situation allowing for that news flash, can you? - Absolutely, I can see it. - You can? - You betcha. If we know it, we gotta do it. - All right. - Don't hang on it. It's a tragic moment and... This is going to shake up the whole world. -All right. Let giff call this next play and I'll get it in. - The patient hasn't had circulation for 30 minutes. I'm concerned about hypoxic brain injury. - I agree, but that is not a guarantee, and it's something we can deal with in living patients. - Even if we found the problem right now I'm not sure what we could do, but are we any closer than we were 15 minutes ago? Do you think it's time? 11:15 pm. Time of death 23:15. I know that emotions are running high right now, but I want us all to be clear on one thing. We did exactly the right things here tonight. Does anyone have thoughts of anything else we should have done? Then let's start the follow-up. Does the patient have any family waiting for him? - Yes, doctor, his wife is in the OBgyn exam room. - All right, I'll go talk to Mrs. Lennon. Nurse Kammerer, come with me. - I can't. I gotta change my shoes. - You're covered in blood. Nobody is going to be looking at your shoes. - But it's suddenly been placed in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in a hurry-up offense -third down, four. On the field, running back Chuck foreman. He takes a hand-off and charges up the middle going down just short of the first down. Foreman. It'll be fourth down. Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt. He'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. - Time-out is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, we've got to say what we know in the booth. -Yes! - Yes, we must say it. Remember, this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC news in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City. The most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt hospital, dead on arrival. -Mrs. Lennon. -Tell me he's all right. Please. Tell me he's all right. - I'm sorry. I can't tell you that. - No, John! It's not true! It's not true. -I'm sorry. - Hard to go back to the game after that news flash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank? -Indeed, it is. - David, did I ever tell you about the time I almost left the army? -What? No, dick. Well, you might have but I don't remember. You got a lot of stories. -Well, this is a quick one. - Dick, let's be honest. None of them are quick. So, how about we skip all the details and just get to the lesson of the story? -Another day then. Just bear in mind, in this profession we can afford to be dented, we can't afford to be crushed. -Thanks. - Does anyone else know? -No. The hospital hasn't released a statement yet. - I need to speak to the person in charge, please. Dr. Lynn do you have the medical report? -I'm getting it now. - The hospital's going to secure it. -That's fine. Nobody's going to read it after tonight anyway. They'll hear it on the news. - About that. - What? - The hospital wants you to do the statement to the press. -Me? I figured PR would be jumping all over this. - They'd probably love to, but the hospital wants you to do it. You're the director of the e.D. - I'm aware of my title, what does this got to do with the press? - The whole world will be looking to this hospital for answers. They are going to be scared, confused, broken-hearted. They don't want a press release. They want to know what we did here, and the hospital wants you to tell them. - All right. Yeah. Give me half an hour. When you were looking for me, did anything stick out to you? Anyone behaving differently? Give me something. I heard a scream, was it Yoko? Did you see Yoko at all? - What are you so worked up over? - I tipped them off that he was dead and they were still working on him. - Think you could be wrong? - If I am, I'm done. I'm completely done. Yeah, sorry, pal. - Yeah, me too. - I love how I'm being treated like a criminal. I love it. Just handcuff me to the bed. Finish the job off. - Press can be seen as a problem sometimes. - Oh, I'm sorry, do you watch the news at night? Do you read the paper in the morning? Do you think it's an accident why I'm still here? - Well... - Why I'm here in the first place? You know what I'm talking about. You wouldn't be here yourself if you didn't want to know what was going on. - Alan, you're right. Okay? - Thank you. - Definitely a part of the reason why I'm here. It was definitely an accident that brought you here, though. - We're gonna need an obit for the broadcast. -I'm writing it? - I can get somebody else... - I want it. - Well, you better get to it. - David, is the medical report ready? - He just finished them up now, Steve. - I've just been informed that the hospital is going to make an official statement. - Well, my notes are all in that file. - And you saw that I checked it. They are detailed and accurate. - They asked me to make this statement. - Makes sense. It's your department. - I suppose. Would you like to attend? -No, thank you. - David, maybe you should. You did the surgery. If they have any questions you could... - Dick, thank you, but no. -Why not? -I had a long night. Good night, Dr. marks. Dr. Lynn. - If that surgery were a success, he'd be chomping at the bit to attend. - Steven, a lot of things would be different if the surgery was a success. Mrs. Lennon would like to speak with you. She's signing for her husband's effects. -Thank you. Mrs. Lennon. - I need you to do something for me. If you could give me thirty minutes to get home. I need to be the one to tell our son. I don't want him to hear it from the news. - Unfortunately, I'm not confident if that is going to make much of a difference. With the police response, and the growing commotion outside the building. I'm certain that we can hold off making the official statement. -Thank you, doctor. -Pardon me. -Thank you. - Please do not block the street. There's gonna be a public statement in the Winston lobby shortly. - Go outside and go help the cops handle the situation. - Is the street clear? - No, sir. There's a swarm of press out there. You open that door and it's a stampede. - You assured me you would take care of it. - We are extremely understaffed for this kind of response. - Didn't you tell them that there would be a statement in the lobby? -Twice. The lobby's full. So is the ambulance yard across the street. - We gotta clear that door, but don't move until Mrs. Lennon is ready to go. - I'll inform the police. - How bad is it out there? - You can't tell the press from the crazies anymore. - How is he? Are they done operating? -He's gone. - Is that more security for me? - Was that her? - Hey, hey! -Is your radio on? - It's complete radio silence. I'm sorry I wish I could be more helpful. - That's not happening. - Bud, bud... He was 40 years-old and is survived by a wife and two sons. While always popular, Lennon was frequently a controversial figure. He used fame to give voice to the cause of world peace and asked us to imagine a world where we can live as one. The irony of such a peaceful man dying so violently does not seem to have silenced his message. Mobs of fans have spontaneously descended on the Dakota and Roosevelt hospital. Police have had to shut down several streets and avenues to control the crowds. These unexpected gatherings seem to be outpourings of affection and a celebration of John's legacy. -Alan! Really? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where do you think you're going? Get back up here. Come on. Easy, easy... And what are you still doing here, Reilly? - Waiting to see what time you get off. - Out! Now. - Okay. Excuse me. - Mhmm. - Take care of yourself, Alan. - All right, let's take a look at that hip. - Oh ho ho, doc, what's the story? - Story about what? - Is he alive? Is he dead? Is he braindead? Did he make a miraculous recovery because he was pretty dead when I saw him. What's the story?! - I'm sorry, Alan, I can't tell you. But there will be a press conference in a few minutes, okay? - Doc! I'm not exactly in any condition to attend! - I'm sorry, but I can't answer you. - Don't you work in the E.D, ? - Weren't you the doctor? - I'm the doctor on call. - So if someone comes in with a gunshot wound, wouldn't that person require your assistance if they were still alive? Doc, give me something - media blackout, Alan. All right? Patient or not, that includes you - I wanna be checked out of the hospital. - Not without an X-ray. - Did you always wanna be a doctor? - Yes. But why is that relevant? - Say you're walking down the street, all right, and this kid runs into the middle of the street and gets hit by a car. You run to save him but by the time you get there, there's a crowd, there's cops, they won't let you through. You say you're a doctor, they don't believe you. You have no credentials but it turns out to be the son of the president of the hospital. How would you feel? What would you do? That you couldn't get to him? - Well, it depends. - On what? - Am I doing it because he's the president's son? Or because it's the right thing to do? - I can only imagine how I come across being a news producer and all but I'll be honest with you. I am a journalist first and human being second. But right now, both my titles align, telling me it's the right thing to do. So give me something. Give me something, doc, come on. Come on. Give me something. -Alan. Good try. I'm sorry, I can't tell you. I'm going to go see to see if the X-ray is ready for you, okay? - Howard [On tv[: The dolphins win sixteen to thirteen over the patriots. -Thank you. Oh! Fffuu! -Sir? Sir, sir sir. Come on, let me get you in. You all right? Can you support yourself? Sir. Are you dizzy? -Did he make it? Newsroom. - Phil! - Alan! - I got off the record confirmation that he's dead. - Alan. Thank god! Arledge decided to run with your lead and Cosell flashed it on Monday night football. We just broke the biggest story of our careers. Hold on, I'm sure ABC radio wants to do a follow-up with you. I'm going to push you through, man. Who do we have on the line? - My name is Alan Weiss. I'm a producer at eye witness news in New York. - So you were there when they brought him in? - Yes, I was inside the emergency department when they brought John Lennon in. - All right, Alan, can you tell us exactly what happened? - Yeah. I'll do my best to tell you as much as I know with as much detail as I can. My gurney was situated outside the O.R. Where they worked on him. -So you saw him come in? - No, I didn't. All I saw was blood, I didn't know who it was. I thought I overheard his name. I confirmed it. I got to a phone. I called my desk. - Can you confirm that he was brought in by the police? - Yes, that's correct. Two police officers brought him in, I believe. -What's happening now? -I'm not sure. I'm currently in the general hospital. I was escorted out by security. -David? -Yeah. - Calling it a night? - Why'd you call him? -Excuse me? - Why'd you call Dr. Lynn? You didn't trust me? You didn't think I can handle it? - David, no. It's just his department. He needed to... -Can I have five minutes? The voice of my youth just died on my table. I had his heart in my hand. I had John Lennon's still heart in my hand, so can I have five minutes where I don't react well to that? - Sure you can. It's understandable. -Then why are you here? - I was just coming to check up on you. You weren't the only one in that room today. I'm sorry that you got blind-sided, but this is the path we chose and this is the world we live in. And I'm sorry I even bothered. That man had a great life. It's just a pity it got cut short. But know it wasn't your fault. There was no gun in your hand. -Have the crowds cleared? - Everyone's waiting for the statement. - John Lennon was brought to the emergency department shortly before 11 pm. He had no vital signs at the time of arrival. Emergency surgery was done in an attempt to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 11:15 pm. I will not take any questions. He was shot how many times? He had multiple gun shot wounds to his chest, to left arm, and to his back. How many times was he shot? - There were seven wounds in his body. Seven bullets? I don't know exactly how many bullets. There were just seven wounds. Who did the surgery? There was a significant injury to the major vessels in his chest. Which led to a massive amount of blood loss which resulted in his death. Did he lose consciousness right away do you think? - I am certain that he was dead when the first gun shots hit his body. Thank you. You have sort of an arm's distance from the stories you cover. And most of those things just didn't affect me as a person. John Lennon affected me as a person. It broke down that wall of separation between being a journalist and being a person. And I've carried that forward ever since then. I've always looked at news ever since then more as a person than just as a journalist. I had no idea that I was gonna be a nurse. I kinda was in high school and someone said, "well what are you gonna do? So I made a like list and a dislike list and I knew I wasn't going to be a teacher because I hate kids. And knew I was going to become a secretary. And I couldn't become a surgeon because there were no such thing as female surgeons in those days so I became an E.R. nurse. Am I still working as a surgeon? Yes, I am, I've been a surgeon for the last thirty-three years and still working full-time. I've been a registered nurse for forty years. I am still working. I'm a consultant right now. I'm not working in a hospital. But I still am actively working as a r.N. I don't think I ever will stop. - You have to understand that in the 70s... New York was in tough shape. The famous headline from the daily news: "Ford to New York City: Drop dead." New York was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, so it was just pulling itself out of that difficulty. It wasn't as trendy and "chi-chi" as it is now. It was a bit more of a gritty city. -It was pre-Gulianni. So there was a lot of violence in Times Square. There was a lot of violence everywhere. - Friday and Saturday nights, you could always expect two shootings, three stabbings, or a prostitue who went down... Off the staircase in their building down the block. Always good for that. - The room where they brought Lennon in was right next to where I was on the gurney. So the edge of my gurney matched the entry-way into the room, so if you wanted to draw a line from my gurney to where John Lennon was? Maybe six feet. - We didn't know until well into resuscitation who it was. - Do I remember Alan Weiss that night? Yes, he was the plague of my existence that night - I remember Alan Weiss was being a total pain in the ass. He was on a stretcher in the hallway and he kept trying to get closer and closer to 115, which was the trauma room. - And we're working on him and his heart is intact. We were pumping his heart. -We cracked his chest... - to try and reach his subclavian to stop the bleeding... - and at the same time Dr. marks, who is an attending surgeon at Roosevelt, he had apparently seen Yoko Ono put in the back of a police car because he lives in that neighborhood and he came into the hospital and he came in and he said, "that is John Lennon." - And everyone kept doing what they do which was what we did best. Whenever we were working on any patient, you blank out who the patient is. You just do your job. -Here's the dilemma. I'm lying on the bed. I've heard it's John Lennon who has been shot. I've seen Yoko Ono. So now, I'm pretty sure it's John Lennon and I have to get to the newsroom. I have to get the information to the newsroom. - And to find out that the police actually let him use our phone, I was not happy with the police either. - The officer who had brought me in had finished filing his report and just came to say goodbye to me and he saw that I was no longer on the gurney and he saw me standing at the end of the hallway... He was a really nice guy and came running up and said, "what are you doing standing up? We brought you in on a stretcher." And I said to him, "well, haven't you heard it was John Lennon?" And he said, "what are you talking about? -We kept working on him. We worked on him for about thirty to forty-five minutes, approximately. We had no pulse, no blood pressure and pronounced him dead after an effort. -When we lose somebody, it's always somber. Because we don't think we should ever lose anybody. - And there also is a feeling of failure. That we didn't do quite what we wanted to do that night. - I probably got out of the hospital a good hour after the press conference, so everybody knew by the time I got out of the hospital. All I remember is that it was like a feeding frenzy. There were just cameras, lights, microphones, reporters. - So the police actually took me home when they were taking the medical examiner up to the Dakota because he wanted to see. As I was walking out to the police car, some jerk in the street yelled and offered me five hundred dollars for my bloody pants. - Yoko Ono, who is one of the most dignified women I've ever met in my entire life, she was in control of herself. She was extremey sad as any woman would be who lost her husband. -I wish... the world knew... that not only... Did this not need to happen, it shouldn't have happened. Here you have the talent of a generation, a once in a generation talent. Everything created: His music, his art... Snuffed out by a senseeless act of violence. I think it takes a whole lot to create something and it takes so little to destroy something. - How much better would the world be today? I guess you can use John's own words. We can only imagine.
