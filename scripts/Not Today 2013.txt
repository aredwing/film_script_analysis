How about you have a nice glass of warm milk... ...take a cold shower, brush your teeth... - I already have a mommy. - Oh, yeah. Why don't we ask her if I should spend the night? How about we ask my dad? Come on, just tonight. I will see you later. Hey, yeah. She's gone. Come on over. I do. Yes, I'm listening. I Promise. Hey, homey, it's not the end of the world. - You guys are killing me. - We're killing you? I mean... Oh, I'm sorry. All right, then. I'm all in. Final hand, final game. Put up or shut up, all right? And to be clear, the winner chooses the location. One dart, no ifs, ands, or buts. All right, what are you doing? - All right. - Now let me deal with this. - I call, I call. - All right. Hey, listen, Please. Did you just hang up on me? What is going on over there? Are the guys over there? Are you drinking? No, no, I am not drinking right now. - Are you lying? - No. Look, just tell me the truth. No, I'm not, okay? Would you like to come over and see? Yes, actually. That'd be great. Yeah? No. - No? - No, baby. What do we have if we don't have trust? - What'd he say? - "If we don't have... " - Did you say that out loud? - Just because I don't go to... ...Bible school doesn't make me a liar. No, but lying does. - Whatever, Caden. - Audrey? - It is about time. - No joke, man. Question. Why are we throwing the dart? Why don't we Google the 10 most exotic locations? Because one, that would be typical. Two, we agreed the winner chooses the location in one dart. So here we go. Oh, God. - Are you kidding me? - No. We are not going to India. Bill, jump on the computer and Google Hyderabad. Yes, master. - Hello, darling. - She is on it. Okay, Party's on, man. I'm in. It says, "This is the crown jewel of the country, home to the Taj Mahal. " We're talking one of the seven wonders of the world. Incredible beaches, smoking hot red dress... - ... on those beaches... - Red dress. ...and we'd have more money there than we have here? Damn. - Heck, yeah. - Okay, good, good. Everybody good? So we'll talk tomorrow? I was getting ready to skinny-dip in your infinity Pool. - You weren't. - Good night, drive safe, get out. All right, Peace, man. Hi, baby, sorry, just bad service. So what were you saying? A quiet night alone? What are you doing here? And when exactly did lying become your second language? What? That's really what you're going with? That's your answer? - Come on. - "What"? When did you become one of those guys? Why are you here again? You said you were alone. - I was. - So I brought you a sundae. Liar. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Those guys don't bring out the best in me. I know, I know. So will you stay a minute? Cheers. A minute. One minute. Yeah, that didn't really seem like a great idea. I was just seeing if it would light. - I don't even want it. - Totally on purpose. You know, you're becoming one of them. You're the only one who says that. And who is them? You're the only one who seems to think that. The reason I'm the only one who says that is because... ...you don't hang out with anyone who cares enough to be honest with you. Thank you for the reminder. I mean, do you even think about going to church anymore? - Audrey, Please. - Do you even miss it? Seriously, okay? Do you wanna know why I don't go to church anymore? - Yeah, I do. - Okay. I don't go to church anymore because... ...it Puts me to sleep, okay? It literally numbs my brain. All right? I've seen the strings, okay? - You know what? - They don't impress me. Everyone spends eternity somewhere. Oh, no. No, no, no. Not my girlfriend. Are you really resorting to that bumper sticker T-shirt Christianity? "Everybody spends eternity somewhere"? Not you. Don't let them take you. Three-second rule, remember? You've gotta be kidding me. Your favorite rule. I'm not, and you should know better. - That was silly two years ago. - You don't have to be a jerk. - You don't have to act like a 12-year-old. - You first. Honestly, Caden... ...is this really who you wanna be? Or should I be asking, is this really who you are? I... I'm cute. - Of course. - And I am funny and sexy. And arrogant and entitled and self-centered. - You forgot smart. - Oh, so smart. What you did right there Proved it. - You're smart. - Okay. Stop acting like somebody you say you're not. Stop hanging out with my mother. Okay. Okay, okay, look. I'll make you a deal, okay? Annika! Not the Prayer warriors! Hi, guys. - Hi. - Are you guys still Praying for me? - Always. - Of course. - Thank you. - We miss seeing you on Sundays. It'd be great to have you back onstage, Caden. - Yeah? - Did you get your guitar from Audrey? Yes, I did, Mother. Ladies, it's school. It's the root of all evil. - Excuses, excuses. - My schedule's hectic! We just miss seeing you around. - Yeah, you know. - Hi. - Hi, hi. - Hey, baby. Nice car. Your father out of town? - Bye. - Thank you so much. - Coming through. - Thank you. Is he cra...? By the way, Dad is great. Could you be nice? Always. Mom, I'm hungry. Do we have food? So, how is Audrey doing? I don't know, you tell me. I'm sure you already know the answer. She just asked me to Pray for her, that's all. Mom, really? Stay out of my business. Just let it go. Let it go. Mom, food, Please. - Hey, do not be like that. - I'm kidding. - Do not be like that. - I'm just kidding. - Sandwiches? - Yeah. So, how's your life, kiddo? You get that job yet? Life? Life is good. Thanks. The job? No. I've been too busy Planning my trip to India. - India? - Yeah. No, I don't... I don't think so. You made a Promise to your mother... ...you were getting a job this summer. Be your own man and take on responsibilities. - You remember any of that? - Yeah. I don't know if you misunderstood. I'm not asking you because I don't need your Permission. I need hers. Mom, India. You know what? I think India's great. - What? - Exactly. - It's great. - Now I don't have to lie to Dad. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. So, you're in? That depends. You have to define "in. " Please, Please, Please define "in. " All right, well. Dad said that you'd have to sign off on the trip. Don't worry, you don't have to foot the bill. Hey, come back here. I want to be very clear about something. This Promise to your mother to get a job. That Promise doesn't mean anything, is that right? Where are you guys headed to in India? Look, Mom, we're going to Goa, Agra... ...Taj Mahal, Hyderabad, which is the Pearl capital of India. I'll get you Pearls. "I'll get you Pearls. " And, Luke, by the way, yes. Promising my mother means everything to me. So, Mom, I will get a job when I get back. Please? Yes, yes. - Yes? - Yes, you have our blessing. Yes, thank you! Thanks for the sandwich. Thanks, Luke! Do you mind telling me what just happened? Yeah, I mean, haven't we been Praying... ...God would get hold of him and shake him up? Yeah, yes, yes, but India, really? - India. - Yeah. Really? You never know. Really. Nice try, Mom. All right. - Yeah. - Where the ladies at? We are in India, right? Is that where we are? - It's English, okay? - Hey, hold on! - Hello, my friend. - What's your name? Hey, open the door! Call her. She Probably misses you. Hey, wait, wait, wait. - Do you think he's... - Just a little bit. No, it's just misty. You're just misty. We'll send her this. Do you want to say something here? Yeah, it was a long flight. I missed you. But look at Captain Serious up in front here. Captain Serious, can we have a little fun tonight?

How many times do I need to tell you? I learned a long time ago that you are not to be trusted. You failed me when I needed you most. Why would I ever choose to trust you again? Hey! Hey! You can't just leave her here! Sir, hurry. We will miss the Plane. AirPort, Please. - Oh, stop, stop, stop. - No time. It's okay. Give me a second. Sorry, sir. Boarding for that flight closed 15 minutes Past. Would you like... India, let's party! Get in the car, naked man! Bring on the girls! This guy's a stupid clown. Where are the women? You don't have to do it one at a time. Hey, C.T., what's up? Hey, Liz. - Let me get Audrey. - Thank you. Audrey, still mad at Caden? It's none of your business, really. He wants to talk to you, so what do I tell him? Gotta go, C.T. See you later. Thanks, Liz. Thanks for nothing, Liz. Well, maybe next time you'll let me borrow your jeans, gosh. - Gosh, let her borrow your jeans. - They don't even fit her. I gotta say, I didn't really expect to hear from you... ...after the way our last conversation went. - What's up? - Nothing good. I don't know, I've been sick the whole trip. I'm sorry. I met this... This guy. He came up to me with his little girl... ...and they were asking for money for food. I don't know, I kind of blew him off. And, I don't know, for some reason, I didn't believe him. And his little girl is really cute and really dirty. And, I don't know, I didn't help them. Well, that wasn't very nice. Oh, well, thank you for stating the obvious. You're so helpful. Hey, you don't have to get nasty with me. I was trying to tell you something for once... ...and you could have just listened, you know? Anyway, I was just looking at some Pictures of them... ...and I just have this really bad feeling about it. I can't sleep. I told them I'd come back and help them, but I didn't. And I should've. I feel like an idiot. What do you think of me? - Are you serious? - What do you think of me? What do I think of you? Plain and simple. I know what my mom thinks. Luke's easy, he has to like me. My friends I could really care less about right now. But you I can't sort out. So now I need to be sorted out? Come on, Audrey. Please, for once, like, you know what I mean. What do you think? Does it matter? Yes. What do you mean, "Does it matter?" Of course it matters. I think that you ran away from God when your Parents got divorced... ...and you haven't found your way back. I think your mom is trying to Pray you back every day. And I think that Luke loves you. Not because he has to, because he wants to, And I think that you can't see any of that right now. Wow, are you done? Whatever. That felt good to get out, didn't it? As a matter of fact, it did. Well, just to clarify that, God ran from me first. Do you really believe that? Yeah, I do. Come on, Audrey, do you even know how much... ...I prayed and got on my knees... ...read the Bible, did everything you're supposed to do... ...and none of it mattered? Nothing changed. So because he didn't answer things your way... ...that means he didn't answer? Caden? Hello? I'm here. Look, it's getting late, so I should Probably go. Okay. I'll Pray for you. Yeah? That'd be good. All right. I miss you. Okay, bye. - Hello? - Mom? Hey, Caden. Hey. - Where's Mom? - Oh, she just left. She's gonna be bummed she missed you. How's it going? Still in Hyderabad? Yeah, yeah, unfortunately, I'm stuck here. Anything I can do for you? Yeah, help me get out of here faster... ...find Mom, help me sleep. Any of those would help. Like I said, your mom is not here. I'm not sure when she'll be back. I wish I could help you get home sooner. As far as sleeping, I learned something a long time ago. If my conscience isn't clear, it haunts me. Keeps me up at night until I've fixed whatever it is. Once I do, I can sleep like a baby again. Maybe God's trying to get your attention. What do you think? If he is, can you tell him to be a little nicer? Did you do something that keeps you up at night, or was it God that did that? Point taken. What if I did do something... ...and that's the reason I can't sleep? What do I do if I don't know how to fix it? I know you hear this from your mother, Probably from Audrey as well... ...but why don't you Pray? God will help you sort it out. He'll open doors, show you a Path. He always does. Not always. No, always. You might not be able to see it right now, okay? Okay. Listen, I'm good. Thanks for the talk. Tell Mom to call. God, I can't find them. Okay, so if it's enough that I tried... ...then, Please, let me feel better about this. Okay, if you wanted my attention... Please, sir. Money, sir. Sir, sir, money, sir? - There you go. - Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Well, if you want my attention, you've got it. If it's enough... Really? Hey, hey. - Hey. - No, no, no. No, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Do you remember me? Do you remember me? Where's the little girl? - Where's the little girl you were with? - Oh, gone. - What do you mean gone? - Gone, sir. Whoa, what do you mean gone? Don't tell me she's dead. She... She have now good life. The education, best for her. It is best life. Please. Wait a minute, you told me you were dying. You told me that she was gonna die. I don't understand. Sir, she would have. Well, okay, just like that? All is well? You know what? Here, hey, hey. Here. Better late than never, right? What, is it not enough? Here. - Sir... - No, no, no. It's for you. Stop. Where exactly did she go? They not say. They take. - Who wouldn't say? - The man who buy her not say. Seriously. Please tell me you're kidding. No, sir, I told you, it is best opportunity. School, job... Wait, wait, wait. You're telling me that you sold your daughter? - The man... - You sold your daughter. Sir, the man that got her said this... - Yeah, you said that. - Not easy for me, but... I just don't understand it. What kind of man buys a child? What kind of father sells his own daughter? I... I no understand. This is good. Can you show me who bought your daughter? My cart, this my future. This best for Annika. - Please, sir... - Annika, that's her name? Annika, daughter. That's your daughter's name? The one you sold? Sir, if this best for her, why you would not do that? Look, man, I don't... I don't understand. No, sir, this my cart, sir. No, no, no, stop. Buy a new one. Okay, I'm not leaving until I see this is what you say it is. Show me where you took her. Take me where this happened. The little girl he sold you yesterday. Yeah. Where's his daughter? I need the girl. Annika. She's gone. I'm just a supplier. I don't know. Look, man, this isn't right, okay? People don't sell their kids, okay? They just don't. They get jobs or they stay with friends. - Sir, go home. - Wait here. - Wait here. - Yeah, go home. Do you remember exactly what... ...that vendor guy said about Annika? She could work with a wealthy family nearby... ...get a good education and food. Maybe even her own bedroom? And that she could come and visit you any time she wanted. This... Yes, I told you. That's exactly what they tell People. I knew this wasn't right. What you mean? What if what I just read is true? What if... What if these little girls that are sold into better lives... ...that they end up as slaves? Please, sir. Don't tell me this. Please, leave me alone. Look, man, I'm only trying to help. How this help me? I trust she okay. You trust? All right, genius, who do you trust? The guy who you give your daughter to and gives you money? That's who you choose to trust? Let's just go back to the guy. We'll ask in a different way. Okay? I heard that they are taken to Goa... ...from there to Bombay, and then all over Asia. I can't believe we're not flying. Why he tell you that...? Where my Annika if she not okay? She fine. I already told you. He didn't tell me where she is. He told me where she might be. After I gave him a handful of my money. There's a big difference. Now I lay me down to sleep. I Pray my Lord my Peace to keep. If I should cry before I wake... ...Please take my fears and bake me a cake. Dear God. I know it's been a long time, but... Sir? Sir, where you go? He took my camera. It's worth a lot of money. Wait! Sir! Sir, no, wait, sir! - No! - Please, sir. - I'm gonna kill that guy! - No, no, no, need... Wait, sir! Please, sir. Your bag here, sir. Sir, Please, wait! It's fine. Well, the watch my dad got me for graduation... ...and the camera... ...he and my mom got me before they divorced. Our last Christmas together as a family. These things mean a lot. Nothing worth this. Nothing. Well, this watch is worth $20,000. That's a lot of lakhs. One lakh is... One lakh is rupees, like five zeros. A lot. Okay, well, then. This camera is worth about seven lakh. That's not that much money, is it? Sir, nothing worth the risk. But you risk more for life. Thank you. You came back. Thank you. Sir, you have faith? You talk to God? I'm Caden. Kiran. Sir, you have great faith. I know. Once upon a time, maybe. No, sir, you came back. This good faith. Sir, this not it. She with rich People doing chores, the house clean. Sir, that's not... No, no, no, don't Panic. He said she might be here, all right? So let's just hope that he's lying. - A little girl. - Little girl? -7 or 8. - So, come, then. Come, boss. Go. Come. Come here. No, no, look, look, look. I'm showing you. Here, come. Follow me. What do you want? Old girls? Young girls? Annika here? No, who is he? He's just my guide. Annika? Do you have little girls? I have many girls. We're looking for a little girl. I have many girls. Young girls, old girls. Give me one minute, one minute. - Do you want to find your daughter? - Listen, she's not there. This not Possible. - You have two choices. - Not Possible! Listen to me! You have two choices. I go in there and you stay here... ...or you can go and I will gladly go back to the train and go back to the U.S. Okay? It's up to you. My friend. How you doing? Welcome to my heaven. Smells like flowers. Which one do you want? I want the one I showed you. I don't know. She's not in here. What does it say? Ask your guide. He will tell you. You not buying? I'm not bothered. Go. You deserve it! God, what I do? I can't read this. Audrey, hello? Audrey, hey, it's me. I wish you would've Picked up. I can't... I don't even know what to say right now. So I found the guy, but not the little girl. He sold her. Come on, Audrey, Pick up, Please. Caden? I just listened to your message and I was Praying. Yeah, well, after what I've seen today... ...Prayer seems like a complete joke. I can't even find the girl we're looking for... ...but these little girls and their faces... You have to trust in God. Sometimes we have to be broken to be useful. That's brilliant, Audrey. Completely brilliant. You know, that's so you. The gospel according to Audrey. Let me just tell you, in my experiences with God... ...I have zero reasons to trust in him right now. Caden, you need to know that God is with you... ...and that he loves you. That isn't the God I know, okay? The God I know I Prayed to every night... ...and begged for a response, okay? The silence was deafening. I sat and watched my family disintegrate, okay? This girl could be dead. You're not hearing me. And to be honest with you, being dead would not be... ...the worst thing, after what I saw today. Sir. Not... Not say that. - Caden? - What if she is dead? What if this can't be fixed? What if I've done all I can do, Kiran? So what do you do, just go to America? Disneyland? "Disneyland. " - You don't get to judge me. - Sir, Please... You might've sold your daughter into Prostitution. - No, no, no, shut up! - You cannot judge me! Sir! Oh, God. Sir. I'm not trying to be mean, okay? But... ...you stink, man. And now I stink. You need a shower. I need to shower. You need everything... ...starting with new clothes. And how do you know about Disneyland, anyway? These little girls, they were offered to me. And they were, like, 7 or 8 years old. Caden, I can't even understand that. It must be heartbreaking. I admire you so much right now. I'm also realizing that... ...I have a lot of growing up to do myself. I want to make a difference. I wanna be doing what you're doing right now so badly... ...but the truth is, I'd Probably Pee my Pants. I'd be so scared, Caden, I'd run away. But like you said... ...you are the one there, okay? And you are not running away. You are acting as God's hands right now. You're being what the church claims to be. But what if she's dead, Audrey? It's Possible. Maybe I... I don't even know. Listen to me, that little girl needs you. She needs you, Caden. She needs you to find her. And her father... ...he needs you to be strong because he won't be. He believes in you and so do I. I know that you are sick of me saying things like this... ...but God is watching. Whether you feel him or not, he is there with you. He cares about you. More than you could ever imagine. I wish I could believe that! Hey, what's the matter? Is something wrong? Why didn't he help those People? What? Why didn't he help those People? - And that little girl. - Nobody's sorrier about that... ...than he is right now. Listen, why do you think he's not answering his Phone? He said the Phone doesn't work everywhere he is. He said that. He's in India, sweetheart. It doesn't work everywhere. Let's go to sleep. Come on, sweetie. What... What were you thinking? Wake up. What were you thinking? What? You're always saying you're the one... ...that's responsible for our family before God. What were you thinking? If I don't know what you're thinking and you keep making decisions... ...without consulting your husband first... ...what am I supposed to do with that? - It's kinda difficult. - No, you just stood there. You didn't argue, you didn't disagree. You just leaned on the counter. I had no idea. You kept Pulling my hand... ...and stopping me from speaking... ...and you were looking at me with those Pretty eyes. Sweetheart, it's late. Come on, let's go to bed. Come on. Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry. No. I know that you're scared. I can see that you're scared. Something bad is happening. You know what? Something bad is happening and there's nothing I can do. - Hey, hey, hey. - And you know what? I'm the one that let him go, I'm the one that wanted this to happen and for God to shake him up. You're the one who thought it was a good idea, and I trust your judgment. You have very good judgment, okay? And if you look at it... ...you can see that God's hand is all over it. It's everywhere. And I think he's getting shaken up. Doesn't that sound like an answered prayer? It sounds like an answered prayer to me. But he's in serious trouble right now, you know that? And he's way over his head. - Okay. - There. Are you sure you wanna go in? You can wait here. I need to see. We're looking for a girl. Raj sent us. - You have money? - Yeah. Please. - What about this? - No. Don't waste my time. No, no, no, I can get more money. If you have the girl, I'm telling you, cash is no Problem. You want the girl? Is she here? The one we asked Raj about? The same, the same. If you want to buy girls, give me this. - Give me! - No, no! I need this one. This one for sure. I need the other one, okay? The one I just showed you. The one in the Picture. No, she's not here. She had an accident. So, you want two? She's not here. Look, I sell you. I have others. - You want to buy or not? - Annika! - What'd I say? - Annika!

If you have the other one, Please, get her quick. Come, come. Wait here. Coming. Is she right? She is good? We need to Pray about it. We can't stop Praying. - No. - Let's Pray right now. No way. I'm done. - I'm not Praying about this anymore. - Okay? I Prayed him into this mess. - Then I will Pray about it. - No, you know what? I'm done Praying. That's what got him there in the first Place. Come on, sweetheart. Your Praying did not get him in this mess in the first Place. What got him into this mess... ...was him deciding he was going to man up. That's what got him in this mess in the first Place. - Yeah, but what if he doesn't man up? - As far as I can see... You Prayed that our son... ...would start seeing the world through different eyes. Start seeing other People in different ways. And that's exactly what's happening. Exactly. Yeah, but, you know, he's so far away. And we're here and he's feeling so bad... ...and there's nothing I can do. You're right, there's nothing you can do. We're gonna Pray. Come on. Come on.

They'll never forget this. You not forget, we look for Annika. She may be in trouble out there. Let's remember that you sold her. You sold her! And besides, who are you to question me or my faith? Why not? You just questioned the faith just now. When I was just little... ...these white People told me about your god, Jesus... ...and said we create in his image. Yeah, everybody except us Dalits.

So what do we do now? - Find Annika. - Yeah. I don't know what else to do. We don't have any more information. We don't have any more maps. All we have is that note. It doesn't even say anything. Just read it again. What is that? What is that? - What? - That. Phone number. It's a Phone number? Call it. Call it. Sir, I not use before this. - Call. - You've never used a Phone before?

Here you go, sir. Anything else? Thanks. Yeah, actually. I need to speak to the manager or owner. So what can I do for you? Actually, I'm looking for a little girl... ...and I was told that the owner would be able to help me. Look, I'm looking for a very specific girl. Have you seen her? Maybe yes. How about now?

To buy a little girl back for her father, if she's even still alive. Okay, Luke, this is bad. Not, like, at home bad. This is literally life or death bad. I know this is not what you want to hear... ...but if you buy her back, you'll hurt other little kids. There's a reason why we don't buy hostages back. I'm guessing you went to the Police already? Kiran said that they wouldn't care. Or worse, we'd have to Pay them, too. - Kiran? - The little girl's father. Can your mother and I make some calls? Where are you, son? Luke, I don't know where I am. I'm somewhere in Mumbai. I met with this girl at a restaurant. She's here. The little girl's here. It's all lined up. Luke, I need the money. If we don't find her now, we may never be able to. I didn't say I wouldn't send the money... ...but I do believe that God will make a better way, Caden. I need to tell you, I am so Proud of what you're doing. I can't imagine in my wildest dreams what's happening there, but I believe... ...God will make a way that won't hurt kids. I know that. God's not making a way, Luke. If he is, I'm really stupid or just Plain blind. No, you are not stupid, you're scared. Who wouldn't be scared? Now, where should I wire the money? Luke, come on. I know you don't have that kind of money just laying around. You're right, I don't. Where can I get it to you? I'll get it to you as fast as I can. It might take an hour, it might take two. But in the meantime, can I ask you... ...to Please think hard and Pray about this before you do anything? No. Okay, just... ...Please wire the money? Send it to a Western Union near the Taj Hotel. I think that's where I'm at. I'm sorry, that's all the information I have, so I hope it's enough. Okay, Western Union. Caden, you hang in there, son. I'm gonna get that money to... Dear God. Please. No! Sir, what happened? Sir? Where's Annika? Where are the girls? They go. What do you mean, "they go"? Where did they go? Sir, I went to get food, you no come back, And I came, they going. I said, "Where to go?" They said, "Back. " They went. Now we find Annika? Sir, Please? How is that Possible? Why would you let them do that? Sir, these girl big. They could have baby, husband. They not listen to me. Are you telling me that they... They choose to live like that? Sir. Sir, if their father Dalit... ...they tell the girl they not good, they mistake. Not worth nothing. That is so jacked up. Sir. Hey, I thought you changed your mind. No. No, no, no, I went to go get the money. It's here, it's on its way. We just have to go get it. - Do you know him? - Yes, yes, yes. He's with me. You know, his kind is not fit for the city. Oh, come on. What does his kind matter? You're about to make money off of me. What does his kind have to do with anything? But he is not going to come with us. I need to take another cab. If anything happens to him, the deal's off. I'm here to Pick up some money. Can I have your ID? Hey, where's my friend? He is coming, no Problem. Do you want the girl or not? You want to waste some more time? Maybe she already spoken for. Come on, let's go. Once we get in, you can Pick. What? No, no. That wasn't the deal. I told you who I wanted. You said she was there. Yes, I know. I thought you changed your mind like the others. Come on, get out. She's not in here. Wait, wait, I have more. Please tell me you have more. Well, these are my best girls. You can Pick the one which makes you happy. No, no, no. I've showed you. I want this one right here, you see? Who said that? - Where is she? - Oh, that one? She's not good. She always ask for some dollies... ...some Puppet or something. - She's just worthless. - Where is she? I told you, you don't want that. These are my best girls. Never mind, okay? I know she's in here. I don't need your help. Who said that? I want her. That's the one. I have the money. I'll Pay. She's not my best. That's the one I came for. You know what? No money will ever fix what you're doing to these little girls. So I'm taking her, okay? And I Promise, I will be back to get the rest. Come here. Get off! Hey, get off! Annika! Annika! Turns out, when Luke said he and Mom... ...would make some calls, he meant it. Not For Sale. That was the first call they made. NFS. A set of initials that a few weeks ago meant nothing to me. But now they're names and people I will never forget. As I look at this little girl, damaged by whatever happened... ...I didn't have the guts to ask... ...but based on what the NFS people said... ...it breaks my heart to even imagine. And her father, trying to make it all better. I know neither one of them will ever be the same. All I can think about are the other kids... ...who are being kept as slaves... ...away from home, away from the people they love and who love them. Now that's what haunts me. There is something to that saying. "I once was lost, but now I'm found. " It's true. I feel it. As for my prize possessions... I have to say, it is nice to have my camera back. And my watch. Trading it for that little girl... ...even if she did end up running back. It was worth it. It seems easy to see that the hand of God was guiding... ...because now I'm aware. I have no more excuses... ...and the very least I can do is get involved. Human trafficking is a Problem worldwide that affects each and every one of us. It has been our goal as storytellers to try and start a global conversation. To get People talking about trafficking, sex slavery, and the Dalits of India. It's everyone's issue, and should be everyone's cause. I'm Brent Martz, Producer of Not Today. - I'm Cody Longo. - I'm Cassie Scerbo. My name is Walid Amini. I'm Shari Rigby. I want to Personally thank you for supporting this film. Human trafficking is a huge issue worldwide. A Problem that affects every one of us. We made Not Today in India because we've been working here for 10 years. We chose to make it here because it's an amazing and beautiful country. Because of these kids, these faces you're seeing. I had no idea that right now, today, there are more than... There are more than 27 million... 27 million... People enslaved around the world. I didn't know that children as young as 4 and 5 years old... ...are bought and sold for sex daily. And I also didn't know about the Dalits of India. The untouchables. A group of nearly 300 million People who are abused and degraded. Because of where they are born. Their last names, the color of their skin. You might recognize this girl here from the movie you just watched. Her real name is Persis Karen, but she played Annika in the movie. She's only here because someone like you decided to get involved. Now I'm aware, and now, for me, doing nothing is not an option. I hope you feel the same way. If you do, together we can make a difference. Get out your Phones and text the word "today" to the number on your screen. We'll send you a link to a website that'll offer ways to get involved. Helping to build a school, sponsoring children. Or volunteer your time to a worthwhile organization... ...who desperately needs your support. To us, how you get involved is not important. What is important is that you do get involved. By texting the word "today" to the number on your screen... ...you'll be able to make a difference in the lives of kids like these. Text the word "today" to the number on the screen and watch what happens. Watch what happens next. You'll be glad you did. So join us. Together we can provide freedom to children around the world... ...and to see the end of human trafficking.
