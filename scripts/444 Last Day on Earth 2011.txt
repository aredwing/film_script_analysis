People are pretty calm, at least for now. Okay, so the green is the voltage. Do back... I liked it the way it was a moment ago. Yeah, I hope I'm not boring you, my dear friend. - Cisco? - Why even bother? - What? - Cisco! No, I'm talking to Skye. For you. I do it for you. I know you like it smooth. Son of a bitch. Is that a meter maid giving someone a ticket today? Well, what do you expect? It's Beverly Hills, right? All I can say is, you better put that fine in an envelope lickety-split before the post office closes tonight. You know what I'm saying? We're now 14 hours and 44 minutes away from the end of the Earth. Our live coverage continues with our crews in New York and our colleagues around the world. As much as I would like to give you the news otherwise, there has been no information to suggest any reprieve in the rapid decline of the Earth's ozone layer. The top scientists still predicting the lethal... Will occur at 4:44 a.m. Eastern time. When that moment comes tomorrow morning, the end will be sudden and global. In Rome, the pope is at the Vatican preparing to deliver a final blessing to an estimated who have converged on St. Peter's Square. In the holy cities of Mecca and Jerusalem spontaneous pilgrimages are under way. Millions are on the move there, hoping their religions... Guess what, man. I just caught the owner as he was leaving. Said he couldn't let down his customers. Oh, shit. Wanted to say good-bye to the regulars. Anyway, he's leaving the door open with a sign saying, "Just take what you need. Think of the others. " I love this guy. He's a total mensch. But then the pilot came on. "So there's an emergency light on. "We don't know if the landing gear went down. "Then we're gonna buzz the control tower, and they're gonna try to see if our landing gear is down. " You think they're right? Yes. I know they're right. I know they're right. I know. I know. "Take your shoes off, because they might melt. "All jewelry off, because it will burn through your fingers. " And then someone started to cry. And then, uh, someone got up from the other side and came over and hugged them, you know? And then somebody else started to cry, and then somebody else got up and went over and hugged them. And then everybody, it was, either you were breaking down or you were hugging. And, uh, everybody on the plane was loving everybody else on the plane, unconditionally, you know? "I could die in ten minutes with you. And let's spend the last ten minutes, um, with a hug. " You know, and it was just... everybody just wanted to hug everybody. It was really beautiful. Oh, yes. Oh. Mm. What do you got? Oh, yes. Can you see the whole pen without looking at the bottom? Well, this is the continuation of a process that actually began in '92 in Rio de Janeiro at the so-called Earth Summit. The Kyoto Protocol was the first iteration of how to get those commitments into a binding form. No, you have to look at the top. And then you have look at the bottom, and then you say, "There's a whole pen there," okay? But by the time you get to the bottom, you don't know if there's still a top there. But in your mind, you think there is. You say, "Geshla, it's a whole pen. Geshla, it's a whole pen. " That's a proof. That's a tiny little proof. You ain't looking at a pen. You're looking at a tiny image in your own mind, okay? You are looking at a tiny image in your own mind. Now, immediately, we have to call you back from the precipice. Hey. We have to pull you back from the edge of this thing. You let me sleep. Are you crazy? Don't think you're living in your head. Well, what time is it? Okay, don't get confused. How long have I been sleeping? It hasn't been that long. We really don't have too many years to begin reducing the global warming pollution that is driving the Earth's ecological system towards catastrophe. Okay, stay with that. They say ten years, don't you? The window, they say, is ten years, essentially? Yeah, and I actually said that three years ago, yeah. And "catastrophe" means what? There are certain elements in the Earth's ecological system that could be pushed beyond a kind of tipping point. The phrase is controversial. But if the Greenland ice pack, for example... Turn it off already, Cisco. I'm tired of hearing their bullshit. And him, I'm sick of him. How many times can you watch the same shit over and over again? Just turn it off, please. Would produce a six- to seven-meter increase. The disappearance of the North Polar ice cap the size of the continental United States: It's been there for 3 million years, a key element in the Earth's ability to cool itself. If it disappears, it would not come back on a timescale that would be comfortable... - Yes! - How you doing, man? I don't see you. Hey, I don't see you. What's on... hey, there you go. How you doing, man? Yeah, we're celebrating, man. You know, party. What can I say? What else can we do? That's a strategy. Yeah, well, I don't know about strategy. I'm just letting my feelings go; That's all. What's Skye up to? She working? She's working. You know. Yeah. Well, man, I wish you were here to party with us. I wish I was with you too, but just keep doing what you're doing. Hey. Lola, girl. Having a good day? Getting your good-byes in? "At 4:44 a.m. ES tomorrow morning, "give or take a few seconds, "the world will come to an end. "It will be the result "of the ever-weakening ozone layer "that has now thinned and dissipated "far more rapidly than even the worst doomsayer "could have ever imagined. "So the final explosion: "Meltdown will come with fair warning "but no possible means of escape. There will be no survivors. " "The world will end." A little, tiny clock is popping up in the back of your head. Why? 'Cause you have a seed in your mind for that, right? How did that seed get there? Who put it there? You did. How? That's karma. Okay? That's karma. What does karma mean? Karma means doing something, saying something, or thinking something which puts an image in your mind. Something happens under the influence of kindness, under the influence of your teacher's blessing. Why are we talking about pot? Why are we talking about clock? Why are we talking about pen? Because the world is not coming from the outside. The world is coming from the images you plant in your mind, and you can plant whatever world you want, you see? You can plant whatever world you want. You don't need a body to die in, 'cause it doesn't exist down here. It's an image in your mind. Plant a different image in your mind, and you stop death. You see? 'Cause this pot's not a pot, and the pen's not a pen, and the clock's not a clock, and the arm is not an arm. It's all the same, okay? If it existed out there, if there was pots, and if there was clocks, and if there was pens, and if they were out there, then, then shoot yourself. My brother killed himself. He got it, and he shot himself, you know. He said, "What's the use? Why should I waste my time?" You know? Kill yourself. There's no point. You can't change anything. If a pot is a pot and a pen is a pen, it... you can't change. Give it up. What, you're just gonna get older? Whoo! Oh! We were talking a lot here in the newsroom about how to deal with these final minutes. I've been in this chair bringing you the news literally thousands of times. Honestly, I don't want to spend my final minute on Earth here. We want the people who work here to be with their loved ones. There was a spirit in New York after the September 11th terrorist attacks that was about caring and giving. We have seen that again today under these unimaginably tragic circumstances. Al Gore was right. By the time we realized what we'd done, we had already ruined the planet. And today it doesn't matter where you live or how much money you have. We are all about to face the same fate at the same moment. My family is waiting for me now. There's nothing more for us to say here but to repeat what we have told you: We don't have much time left. You don't need me to sit here and tell you how tragic this is, so this is the end of our commentary. We are going to fill the screen with live camera views from all over the city, and we will leave those pictures up until the end. How can you not think about the end? How do you not plan for the future? How do these guys not think about what the hell is gonna happen next? You know, whether you're... whether you're cutting down a tree or building the Trade Towers or the atomic bomb... fuck that. I'm sick of it. Where are the experts? Where are the fucking experts? These guys, they're just talking, talking, don't even have the fucking slightest clue. Never mind doubt. I mean, we don't know what the fuck is going on. We're all gonna die, guys! We're already dead! Damn. He looked right at me. He was thinking straight. Why let someone dictate when you're gonna die? Fucking motherfuckers. Hey, don't put that coat on him! Leave that man alone! If you want to help him, light a candle. No! Is that my fuckin' landlord? Hey! Hey, Wally! How's that 2.5% a year feel now, huh? No, no, I'm not saying him. Fuck you! Fuck you! It's not his fault. It's not anybody's fault. We're all in the same boat. We're all doomed. I don't want to leave you. These guys chopped down every fucking tree on the island to make a statue. Fuck. And they don't have anything to build a boat to get the fish. At least they were doing... worshipping God... the fucking... I shouldn't be saying that. Fuck that book! What is wrong with you people? Leave that man alone! What is wrong with you? Baby. Come on. Come on. What are we waiting for? I'm waiting for you to come down. Come on. What are we waiting for? A couple hours' difference? Get down, Cisco. Come on. Get down. Get down. Thump! Stop it. Stop! Hey. What? Come on. It's gonna be okay. You're so sweet. It's gonna be okay. I don't know what to do. Just be with me. I know. I am. You want to fly? Yes. - Yes. - Yes? You'd like that? Shoes off! Now, that I can do. Grab my wrists. Ah-ya! Must have been the gaff tape. What happened to your legs? - Okay. - Spaghetti legs. Okay. Okay. Fly on home, fly on home. Where you goin', girl? She be a pink butterfly. Oh, yeah. Where you goin', girl? Where you goin'? We're going together up. Where are we going? Ah-ya-ya! Isn't it beautiful up here? Too beautiful. I pissed my pants. Your turn. Who's that? Yeah? Yeah? Delivery. Yeah, come on up. Yeah, I was wrong. You're kidding me. No. Come on. You hungry? Yeah. Not again! Hi. Come on in. Thank you very much. What's your name? You've been here, like, a thousand times, but I don't even know your name. Chung. How are you doing? You know what's going on, or don't you give a shit? Hey, kid. Hey, you want some food? Oh, I doubt it, huh? You've probably had plenty of this stuff. Oh. Keep the change. Take it. Is there anything I can do for you? Can I get you anything? Skypey. Skypey. Skypey. Oh, yeah, Skype. Yeah, I can do that for you. I just got to get my computer. Okay. Okay, you just go ahead. It's just... You know how to do it, right? Just... yeah, there you go. Skye. Come and get it. Is it ready? Well, yeah. That's Vietnam. That's Vietnam he's calling. Chung? Thank you. I'm so glad I've known you. Chung. Thank you. We human beings are the... almost like a creator of the world or the controller of the world. Through technology, through science, we can do anything, everything. We do not run nature. I think we human beings something above nature. I think that's wrong. After all, we are part of the nature. Uh, so through that way, it become clear, you see, we have the responsibility to take care of the environment, of the nature, because ultimately, we are part of the nature. So the nature balance dramatically change, we will suffer, the entire humanity. Then, this will, what... what were instinct will disappear. So that's either one, one force. Then another, I think, I think, every human... requirement or meaningful life, we need to seek internal, sort of inner spiritual development. Now, here, when I say it's a spiritual... spirituality, not necessarily religious faith. But even without religious faith, still there are such... a sense of caring one another, sense of sharing one another. There's a sense of community. These are the basic human good qualities. These are our fabled spirituality. Without that, you can't be happy person. One says that money is the source of all evil. Is that true? Yes. - No. - Yes. Of course, if we, uh, just become slave to money... Eh. Then all our energy or mind, this is... concentrate on money. And then, uh, the greed, that kind of thing, extreme greed... Then in order to get more money, then no hesitation to adopt various different method. Scandals or corruptions or exploitation, forcing these things. Then, of course, money, it then becomes evil. But for sustain, for life, without money, you can't. You're a medical man. What do you think happens after bodily death? After bodily death, then they all get wings, and they all start flying up toward heaven. Yeah? And do you think you'll be a good flyer? I think I'll fly up there eventually. Yeah? And then once you gets there, what happens? A big party? Big party up there. Oh, yeah. And then you fly around some more? Now that's the whole idea behind it. It's a big party. And you're getting with your old friends, and even, even those that aren't too friendly with you. The people that are responsible for the end of the world: How do you feel about them? Well, the people that are responsible... Hopefully it'll backtrack on them, and they'll get the same treatment that they gave to the ones that they subjected to that fate. Hey. Hi. Hang on. I just got to open this up. There we go. Oh, baby. I'm not very technological. There we go. How you doing? I'm all right. Yeah? And your mother? You know her. She's acting like nothing's gonna happen tonight. She's acting like everybody's stupid. What's with her? She thinks I'm stupid. She's... she's in denial. Well, listen. She's your mother, so that's just the way it is, okay? Okay. How's Skye? She's all right. What are you gonna do tonight? Oh, um, Lena's coming over to stay. And her mom? She can't stand her. Besides, her boyfriend's over. It'll be better for her over here. Um, I don't know. We'll play some video games. You say hi to her for me, okay? I've always liked her. She's doing all right? She says she doesn't want to die a virgin. Guess it's too late for that. Dad, don't cry. I'm sorry. Because you're gonna make me cry, and I did my makeup perfect. I'm sorry. I miss you. I miss you too, Dad. J.J. J.J., you have to let your friend in downstairs. Here comes Morticia Addams. Yeah. Hurry up, J.J. Hi. She's locked out downstairs, honey. The doorman's not there. You're gonna have to hurry up before something happens to her. Go on. She's downstairs. See ya, hon. Hon. - Hi. - Hi. Look, you should not be upsetting her like that. How can you be so selfish? Seriously. You gonna be angry still? Now? I didn't leave. It was you that didn't stay. I... I didn't stay? Who ran off with the teenager? I didn't run off. It was you. It was your pride. If you would've just hung in there, everything would have been different. Yeah, different. I'll tell you different. Yeah, tell me. Your daughter would have had a father instead of some guy who didn't even really care about her. I cared! Never. - I... - When? I cared. I didn't want to leave. I'm a guy that sticks. It was you that didn't want me. I... I was... I was so, so confused. And you just had to be a little more patient with me, but you were too scared. You were... you were too anxious. Anxious? What... what... you know what? You need to just to grow the fuck up. Grow up! You think... You think I love her more than I love you? You think I love my family... Calm down! Calm the fuck down! You don't understand. Get away from me! Stay, stay, stay, stay. No! Don't go. How could you? Skye. I need to speak to my mother! Okay, but you don't understand. Hi. Hello, darling. Hi, Mom. What's the matter? I'm so glad you called. He's such a jerk. He was just telling her that he loves her. Doesn't he know how much it hurts me? And that bitch, she was just looking at me. She was just laughing at me. Well, was she at your house? No, it was on the phone. It was on Skype. She's so ugly. How can he be with such a woman? It's all right. He's with you now. That's what matters. I can't take him sometimes, Mom. I can't help it. The whole system. I don't believe in anything that's going on. And honestly, I just can't stand all this, and I don't want to believe all what's going on. I'm still gonna be hanging on, you know, the fact that, that, uh, you know, I mean... I know that the world, that the Chinese had an atomic explosion 5,000 years ago. I know that the world will stay. If we perish, okay, we perish. But then we live on as well, so we live on. But I'm just so angry at all of this, and I can just barely, barely talk about it. I want to scream at those fuckers, All those politicians and all those rules and the PC world. And, you know, I mean, look at this smoking. I can't even smoke anymore. What's the matter with me? You know, you can't smoke. You can't smoke in your own house. You know, people denounce you. If you throw a butt on the ground, you have to pay 50 quid. It's outrageous. I mean, what the fuck has the world come to, you know? I'm just, you know, I'm just so upset. Don't get upset now, Mom. Really, please. Deep down, you're at peace in your heart. I know, it's... You've done the right things. You've done your art. You've done everything that you can possibly do to have... to have a faith in this world that they've destroyed. And I'm proud of you. And I don't want to see you sad. I don't want to see you upset. I don't want to see you... you know, I want to remember you happy. I want to remember you with a big smile on your face and your little green eyes and your little grin. I love you. I love you so much. I love you. I love you so much, Mom. Yes, I love you. - Good-bye. - I love you. Thank you for being my mom. Just transcend that. Just go to another sphere. Yeah. And we'll be all right. Yeah, a better sphere. Thank you for being my mom. I love you. I love you. Hey, Javi. Javi. Yo, it's Cisco. Oh, God. Oh, right. You scared me for a second. Cisco! What are you doing here? Hey. Hey, brother. Good to see you. Yeah, good to see you. Come here. Why didn't you use the front door? You're gonna get yourself killed doing that. Oh, shit. I don't believe it. No, I can't either, man. I'm surprised to see you here. Yeah, man. Get him a chair. Here. Have a seat. Thanks. Tempting fate tonight. What a surprise. Yeah. Good to see you. You want something? You want a... we've got brandy. Some water. Yeah, please. Yeah? Thanks. Sticking with it, huh? Guess we're all here. Want to look death in the eyes. Looking good, buddy. Good, good. - Salud. - Salud. - To end times. - To old friends. How much time you got? Uh, 23 days. Awesome. That's awesome. And you? Well, if things weren't the way they are, I'd have 20 years end of next month. - 20 years. - Yeah. If things weren't the way they are. Yeah, well, you know, if we ain't gonna get high now, we're never getting high. Why not? Why? Have you got a good enough reason to get high? Tell me. I'll get high with you. How about... how about, like, the ending of the world? Eh, no. Not good enough. The world's been ending ever since it started, man. You know, we've been ending ever since we were born. Don't take that shit too seriously. - I don't. - Good. I'm not sure I can take this rap right now, man. What rap? I don't know. I just feel you winding up a little bit. Who, me? I'm not winding up. I'm sitting here with a fucking choice, man. You know, the choice is for me, I mean, I don't care. You can get high right there. You know, I won't judge. I don't give a shit, you know. I would prefer you didn't, but, for me, I feel like, I just feel like I got a choice, you know? I could shoot some dope, go out nodding, or go out eyes wide open. You know, see the fucking light show. I mean, what the fuck is that gonna look like, you know? The end of the world, the end of the dream. The end of... I want to see it. I want to see it. I want to fucking be wide awake. So that's the choice. Yeah, I'm not sure I want to. What's going on changes everything. It does, and it doesn't. Tell me. For me, I just think it changes a lot, but I got to stay true to... for me, I just feel like I got to stay true to who I've been. The good stuff. Oh, shit, you guys are getting heavy. I just want to get laid, you know? You just want to get laid? Yeah. - You just want to get laid? - Uh-huh. Come here. You're gonna get your wish. Mmm. Get it while you can, right? Good to know what you want. Got to get off some way tonight. And may I... this is not a rap. - It's a suggestion. - Okay. If I may humbly offer this suggestion to you, my junkie brother, right, who I've been through everything with? Yes. I'm listening. Don't pick up a minute before the end of the world. Seems like as good time as any... That's the choice, though. That's the... you know? I know. That's the choice. Yeah, I know. Let's watch the light show, man. We were walking home from this meeting, and we walked by here, and I see the light on, right? And I'm like, "I wonder if these guys are still here." Haven't thought of them in fucking years, man. This used to be my family. This was like, you know, my brother, my sisters, like my family. I saw the lights on. So I ring the buzzer, and Javi answers the fucking door, and they're right in the chairs where I fucking left them, you know? And so come to be of service over there, be of service here, whatever. I don't know. If some idiot comes in and needs another idiot, I figured I'd be here. And who walks in? You're that idiot. It's a miracle. It's a fucking miracle. It's not a miracle. No, there's something going on. Why are you here? Why did you come through the fucking window? Just, you know... I haven't seen you in how long? - A long time. - Long time. - Yeah, yeah. - Long time. You know, I just think, you know... it's not... I just been thinking about, you know, the past and friends, and I just felt the need to drop by, huh? And so I'm not, you know... I don't know. I got to go, though. You got to? Yeah, no, I can't, because Skye's... no, Skye's at home. You know, she's by herself. You gonna go right home, though? Yeah, I got to go. I mean, go right home. Just... it's dangerous out there. Yeah. Yeah, no, it feels... I don't know. It's weird out there. But no. I got to go, okay? I'll walk you out. Listen. I love you, buddy. I love you too. Use the front door like a normal person. Glad we saw you. - Okay. - Bye. Yeah. All right. Thanks, man. Hey, Cisco. Yeah? What if they're wrong? Huh? Think about it. Okay, I'm thinking. All right, buddy. Love you. Take care. Thanks. Hey, uh, Javi? Yeah? He didn't... No, no, no. He didn't get nothing. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. He better not. He's better just the way he is. Right, right. No, I'm sure. I'm honest. You wouldn't lie, what... being a drug dealer and everything. I would not. - All right. - He didn't. What'd I say? Go easy. # You made me cry when you said good-bye # # Ain't that a shame? # # My tears fell like rain # # Ain't that a shame? # # You're the one to blame # # You broke my heart when you said we're apart # # Ain't that a shame? # # My tears fell like rain # # Ain't that a shame? # # You're the one to blame # # Oh, well, good-bye # # Although I'll cry # # Ain't that a shame? # # My tears fell like rain # # Ain't that a shame? # # You're the one to blame # # You made me cry when you said good-bye # # Ain't that a shame? # # My tears fell like rain # I don't want to die! # Ain't that a shame? # # You're the one to blame # # Oh, well, good-bye # # Although I'll cry # # Ain't that a shame? # # My tears fell like rain # # Ain't that a shame? # # You're the one to blame # Cisco. Where were you? I just went out on the streets to see what was going on. I forgot my keys. I didn't mean what I said. I was just trying to get her to understand. She's a hard case. You're not like her. That's one of the reasons I love you. Forgive me. Come inside me. How could you? Let me have it. It's mine. No. Give it to me. No! I want it. How could you? Come on. Give it to me. All right. Come on, we'll... we'll throw it out together. You're hurting me! Ah, this is fantastic. Also the serpent... which represents the dynamic of life... the serpent can shed its skin to be born again, and so represents the power of life to throw off death and represents the bondage of life to time. It's the dynamic of life and consciousness in the field of temporal pairs of opposites... birth, death and all that. And life goes on through it. It's been turned into the negative principle in our tradition, as though our tradition were against life. And, uh, so, since... since our tradition is against life, well, the deity himself is against life. And you have a deity who's talking about supernatural grace and virtue and all, but life is something to be, as it were, despised instead of celebrated and a body as something awful rather than awesome. Cisco! Cisco! Cisco, come to me, please! What's happening? What's that? I'm here. Hold on to me. Stay with me. Stay with me! I am. Don't be scared. I'm scared. Don't be scared. Who makes this whole tub run? Ain't it us, guys? Yeah! Well, then, we belong, don't we? We belong and they don't, that's all. As far as this being hell, aw, nuts, you lost your nerve. That's what. This is a man's job, get me? It belongs. It runs this tub. No stiffs need apply. We aren't stiffs, see? What comes down to a ultra feeling, I mean, the ultra feeling that love, family is important. Hey, have you ever heard of this? What are we gonna do when it's 4:44? But I can see that deep down you're at peace in your heart. You've done the right things. You've done your art. You've done everything that you can possibly do to have a faith in this world that they've destroyed. And this is very difficult to explain, okay? In those few minutes, you see the face of every living creature in this world, okay? In the minute. At the same time, you see the whole face of billions of creatures. And I'm not talking just people: Animals, insects, birds, worms, snails, you know, all of them. You can see. We're together. I'm... I'm here. I'm here. Don't be afraid. We're here together. I'm gonna smoke my cigarette, and I'm gonna die. There's gonna be a really big light, Cisco. But don't be afraid of it. I'm not afraid. It's our love. I'm not afraid. It's our wisdom. We're going together towards this big light. We're going together towards the big light, Cisco. My heart against your heart, and together, we're taking all beings with us. And we're protecting them, and we're loving them, and we're taking them with us. And we have each other. And we surrender completely to God. And you're protected. And we're together, and we're going together. And all we have is right now. All we have is each other. All we have is each other. I love you. And we're angels already. # Lit cigarette # # Blindfold in place # # Your time has come # # 20 steps away # # Throw it away # # It's the last day # # Your time has come # # All hell to pay # # From sweet Detroit # # To the Great Plains # # They bared his heart # # He watches and waits # # He knew it would come # # Like the wind and the rain # # Get on your knees and pray # # On your knees and pray on the last day # # Silver and gold # # Taken away # # They lockin' it up # # For the kings and the slaves # # The Duke Ellington's hand # # Touching your face # # All is his # # 'Cause he gave it away # # His kingdom gone # # Without a trace # # I'm talking to you # # Throw it away # # Let's sit and wait # # Get on your knees # # On your knees and pray # # It's the last day # # The last day # # The way he was born # # Seems insane # # From their mother's arms # # To their daddy's grave # # It's the devil's work # # So the devil pay # # Watch what we got # # And do it our way # # That's what they say # # That's what they say # # Throw it away # # Well, that's it anyway # # God is gone, God is gone # # Well, they say, they say # # That our last day # # It's the last day # # The last day on Earth # # It's the last day # # The last day on Earth #
