Good time! Good! What was my time? - Five-eight. - Five... That's good enough to win just about every prize they got at that rodeo! I'll give to you a paper of pins And that's the way our love begins If you will marry me, me, me If you will marry me I'll give to you a feathery bed With downy pillows for your head If you will marry me, me, me If you will marry me But you don't want my paper or pins And you don't want my feathery bed You want my house and money instead That is plain to see Well, here they are Take everything My house, my money My wedding ring And in the bargain I'll throw in me If you will marry me Bo, when you was five, I just throwed you on a horse, smack! And there you was ridin'. - Remember? - Yup. When you was eight, I throwed you in the creek, splash! And there you was swimmin'. - Ain't that right? - Sure, Virge. Splash! Bo, you're 21 years old and we're on our way to a big city, Phoenix, Arizona. It's time you met up with a gal. A gal? Oh, it ain't nothin' to be scared of. In a way, women and swimmin' is pretty much the same. You got good reflexes, Bo. You'll make out just fine. (HORN HONKS) So long, Bo. Bring back some prize money. Take it easy, Orville! Two for Phoenix, Arizona. We goin' down for the rodeo. I figure I'm gonna win me just about every prize they got down there. Well, that's nice. Now sit down someplace. You got a long ride ahead of you. VIRGE: Bo, the lady's hat! - Oh, sorry, ma'am. - Why don't you look where you're goin'? It was an accident, sir. He ain't used to travelin'. - This is his first time off the ranch. - Virge, that's a lie! That's a lie and you know it! I been all the way to Helena. That was when he was 12 years old to have his tonsils out. Well, that still counts! Here, give me that. (ALL SINGING) If you will marry me, me, me If you will marry me I'll give to you a petticoat red All stitched around with golden thread... Virge? I've been thinkin'. You know, about what you said. What was that? You know. About me findin' a gal. Oh, what... What about it, Bo? I don't know anything about gals, Virge. Nothin' at all. Well, that's what I mean. It's about time you learned. It ain't nothin' to be scared of, Bo. You know how much you like swimmin' when you got used to it. Besides, I know the idea crossed your mind once or twice. I seen you lookin' at them pictures in Orville's magazines. I'll give to you a feathery bed With downy pillows for your head... Maybe I glanced at them pictures a couple of times. But if I do find me a gal, it ain't gonna be one of them gals from all those magazines. I already decided. I'm gonna get me a angel. - An angel? - That's right. I wouldn't set my sights too high if I were you, Bo. You just figure on pickin' out some plain-lookin' little ol' gal, with a cooperatin' nature and a good personality. I mean, we gotta be realistic. What's some angel gonna want with a cowhand like you? What's that got to do with it? That steer this mornin', he didn't wanna get throwed, did he? Well, I throwed him. Some wild horse you're breakin', he don't wanna get broke, do he? But you don't let what he wants stop you. What makes you think a girl's any different? This trip is gonna be mighty educational. Kiss me quick and go, my honey Kiss me quick and go to cheat sur... Listen, Virge. I'm gonna find me an angel. I'm gonna find me a real hootenanny of an angel! She gives me any trouble, she's gonna find herself with them little old wings just pinned right to the ground! (BREATHING DEEPLY) WOMAN: Oh! - Mornin', ma'am! - What are you doing? Push-ups, ma'am. Gotta get the kinks outta my bones. Hey, cowboy, get up off that floor! Thirty! Whew! I can do 30 set-ups, too. Pipe down and stop botherin' folks. You woke up everybody in the bus. Well, it's mornin', ain't it? It's time to get up. That's the trouble with you city folk. Lay around in bed all day long and you get soft. Hey, when do we stop for breakfast? Look! There's a place! Hey, you passed it! Look. This ain't no taxi. It's a public vehicle. Stops where it's scheduled to stop and no place else. And meanwhile what's a passenger supposed to do? Just starve to death? Poor old lady back there, you can hear her stomach rumblin' from here! Bo! You're out in civilization! Forgive him, ma'am. He didn't hear a thing. Our next official bus stop is Grace's Diner, a couple of miles up the road. That's where we stop, Grace's. Can we get some breakfast in here? Hello, Grace. Well, look what the cat dragged in. - Hello, Elma. You the passenger? - That's right. - She's goin' for the symphony concert. - And to see my sister. How about a little service? Sounds like your passengers are hungry. Oh, I'll go ahead and wait on 'em. Ah, some crazy cowboys. That young one there, he's a real troublemaker. His friend ain't so bad. He just sits in the back of the bus playin' his guitar. A little music's real nice when you're drivin' along. I'm very fond of music myself. Are you, Grace? I didn't know that. Yeah. I'm a very musical person. Well, come on in. I'll fix you somethin' to eat. Ahh. Ma'am, uh... Ma'am, I... Give me about three hamburgers. - Three? How do you want 'em? - Raw. - Honest? - Well, sure. That's the only way to eat 'em, with a big hunk of onion and some piccalilli. And a piece of pie. And you'd better set a quart of milk beside him. He's still a growin' boy. - Well, all right. - Pie and coffee for me. I'm still growin' too, but in a different way. Gotta watch my figure. Real nice place you got here. As much as I've seen of it, anyway. What's that supposed to mean? CARL: I was just thinkin'. I'll bet that apartment you got upstairs is real nice too. Love to see it sometime, how you got it fixed up and all. Hmm, don't pour it! Ahh. Okay, mister, let's get goin'. We're never gonna make Phoenix sittin' around this broken-down, miserable restaurant. Hey! You! All aboard, folks. Now wait a minute! I happen to be the owner of this here broken-down, miserable restaurant. Don't pay him no mind. You're only the twelfth human bein' he's seen this year. - Just his way of talkin'. - Well, it ain't a way I care a lot for. - I don't blame you a bit. - Virge! Bo, you're plumb wrong about this place. It's nice and clean and well-run! And you certainly couldn't ask for a prettier or a more charmin' owner. - Wait a minute, cowboy. - I mean it, ma'am. And I wanna apologize for this young barbarian here. - Hey, what ya doin'? - It's just somethin' I seen in a movie. - It don't offend you, I trust. - Oh, of course not. Only you just caught me up short, that's all. Hand kissin'? That ain't my idea on how to get a gal. - We know that, Bo. - Bye, Grace. So long, honey. - You the one that plays the guitar? - That's right, ma'am. I'm real fond of music myself. All aboard. Bus loadin' right away. Good-bye, Grace. See you in a couple of days. - So long, Carl. - Come on, cowboy. - Good luck at the rodeo, cowboy. - Thanks, ma'am. Come back real soon, you hear? - So long, Carl. - So long, Grace. Come back soon, hear? Talk about angels. How about her? Well, she may be an angel, Virge, but she ain't my angel. How can you tell? I'll know. When I see my angel, I'll know right off the bat. Fasten your seat belts and take off your coats. We're startin' to lose altitude. Landin' in Phoenix in about an hour. Well, I'm sorry to leave you folks, but this is where we get off. "Welcome, cowboys. "The town is yours." Yee-haw! That's us, Virge! That's us! So long, fellas. Don't let him take any wooden nickels. I'll be drivin' you back tomorrow night. That is, if you're still in one piece. Don't you worry about us, mister. We're gonna be all right. You just drive your bus. Come on, Virge, let's go register. Is that our hotel? Bo! Bo, wait on the corner. You gotta try to remember. They go when it's green, they stop when it's red. Never seen so many gals. Must be a hundred head of 'em. Bo! Wait till it turns green. Kiss me quick and go my honey Kiss me quick and go To cheat surprise and prying eyes VIRGE: Bo, you're gonna wash yourself down to a nub! What are you doin' anyway? Ain't got nothin' like this at home. Shower and bath at the same time! Bo, you have a terrible habit of overdoin' everything. - Come on! - Yee-haw! Listen, Bo, if you're gonna take all night, I'm gonna step across the street. That there Blue Dragon place seems kind of interesting. You go ahead, Virge. I'll be over there in a couple of minutes. Just wait outside. Why ain't you outside where you belong? (SCREAMS) I've heard enough of you, you ignorant hillbilly! Now get out there and get to work! You'd better change into your costume, honey. You're late. And he called me an ignorant hillbilly. How do you like that? Well, ain't ya? I don't mean ignorant. I mean, but you do come from the Ozarks. I ain't sung hillbilly since I was... Well, not since I turned chantooze. I've been tryin' to be somebody. (SIGHS) Can you imagine if Hildegarde was jumpin' down between her numbers, sittin' in some truck driver's lap? I don't know why you just don't quit. I can't. Look. I don't get paid till Wednesday. I owe for my room and everything. Besides that, it took me too long to get this far. What's that line for? That line? You might say that this line here is the history of my life up till now. - See right there where it starts? - Yeah. That's River Gulch, the little old town where I was born. River Gulch. I never even heard of it. Well, it ain't there anymore anyway. Floods come and washed us all away, all except me and my baby sister, Nan. - Oh. - I just picked her up and took her along here, this line. - Yeah? - Till we got to Lubbock, Texas. - You know what happened there? - What? Nan got this job as a waitress, and I got to workin' in Liggett's Drugstore. - Yeah? - And, this amateur contest opened. And, Nan said to me, "Honey, why don't you enter yourself in that contest? "You've been watchin' people in movies." Well, Nan and I used to live in the movies. "You've been watchin' people put over their songs and gestures," you know. And so, I did it, and I won it. - First prize? - No. Second prize. A couple of boys jugglin' milk bottles, they won first prize. Anyway, that's how I got my direction and all. Direction? Oh, sure. If you don't have a direction, you just keep going around in circles. And look. You can see by this just how straight my direction is. River Gulch, that's where I started, this is where I am now, and look where I'm goin'. - Where? - Hollywood and Vine! Look, straight as an arrow. River Gulch, whew, Hollywood and Vine! What happens when you get there? What happens? Honey, you get discovered. You get tested, with options and everything! And you get treated with a little respect, too. What's goin' on in here? She's changing into her costume. You want her to go out there naked? Get out there and take care of them tables. Come on, Dinah Shore. Them cowboys is gettin' real lonesome. Zip her up. Go zip yourself up! He looks like the safest. - Oh, I never know what to say to 'em. - It's easy. Just say some cute little joke, like, "Hello, mister. Buy me a drink. I'm so dry, I'm spittin' cotton." That's a real cute one. Go on. Hello, mister. - Howdy. - I wonder if you'd buy me a drink. I'm so dry, I'm spittin' cotton. (LAUGHS) That's a good one. It sure is. Whiskey for the lady. Beer for me. I'll give to you a paper of pins And that's the way our love begins If you will marry me, me, me If you will marry me You sure have a good head for whiskey, ma'am. I don't wanna sound like I'm keepin' track, but that's four in a row. Oh, that's the way I am. Sometimes I can just drink all night long. Happy days. Hey, what ya doin'? Let go of me. - That ain't whiskey! - Let go of my arm! - That's tea! - I can't help it. That's all they let us drink here. Last night I had to drink 15 tea and sodas. You've been hustlin' me for drinks, 60 cents a shot! One thing I can't stand is a woman tries to make a sucker outta me! - Come sing a song. - I'm sorry! Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen! I know you ain't payin' no attention. You're all too busy havin' fun and enjoyin' yourselves. (CROWD LAUGHS) But we got this little floor show, and we have to do it. Hope it don't disturb you none. Okay, baby. Take it away. (BAND PLAYS JAZZ) That old black magic Has me in its spell That old black magic That you weave so well Those icy fingers Up and down my spine The same old witchcraft When your eyes Meet mine The same old tingle Bo. That's her, Virge. That I feel inside - That's my angel. - Angel? She's just a gal works in a saloon. Look at her gleamin' there, so pale and white. And down and down I go Quiet! And round I go Quiet! (SHUSHING) Keep quiet over there! Like a leaf that's caught in the tide (SHUSHING) I should stay away (SHRILL WHISTLE) But what can I do (CHATTERING STOPS) Bo, Bo! That's better! Now let's keep it this way! Can't you see the little lady's tryin' to sing? - Sit down, cowboy. - That goes for you too, mister! - (ALL LAUGHING) - Quiet! Okay, miss, I reckon you can go on with your song now. - Whereabouts were we, Henry? - "I should stay away." I should stay away But what can I do I hear your name And I'm Aflame Yee-haw! Aflame with such (SHRILL WHISTLE) A burning desire That only your kiss, kiss Kiss Can put out the fire For you're the lover I have waited for The mate that fate had me created for And every time Your lips meet mine Darlin', down And down I go Round and round I go In a spin Lovin' the spin I'm in Under that old black magic Called love Love, love What you all starin' at? The lady's finished. You can start your yammerin' again. Well, go ahead! Start yammerin'! (CHATTERING) My name is Beauregard Decker, ma'am. I'm 21 years old and I own my own ranch up in Timber Hill, Montana, where I got a fine herd of Hereford cattle, a dozen horses, and the finest sheep and hogs and chickens in the country. Now, I come down for the rodeo tomorrow with the idea in mind of findin' me an angel, and you're it. Now, I don't have a whole lot of time for sweet talkin' around the bush, so I'd be much obliged to you if you'd just step outside with me into the fresh air. What'd you say? My name is Beauregard Decker, ma'am. I'm 21 years old and I own my own ranch up in Timber Hill, Montana, where I... Yes, I, I know. I heard all that part. - Okay, let's get outta here. - No... I'm mighty grateful to you for what you did, but, we're, we're not allowed to go out with the customers. But you could buy me a drink if you wanted. I'm so dry, I'm spittin' cotton. Don't ever use the stuff. Besides, I ain't got time for a drink. - I wanna be in bed by 10:00. - Huh? I'm ridin' in the rodeo tomorrow, so I need my sleep. - Oh. - So will you come on? Well, we're not supposed to... - Bo. - Hold my hat, will you, Virge? - Where you goin'? - Splash! You're sure a good singer. I'm a chantooze. Oh. That's why I call myself Cherie. That's my name, Cherie. That's all the name you got? That's all you need. Like Hildegarde, she's a chantooze too. Cherry. Cherie! It's French. It means "dear one." Well, my name's kinda French, Beauregard. It means somethin' too. What's it mean? I ain't gonna tell you. You'll laugh at me. - No, I wouldn't. - Yes, you would. Honest, I wouldn't. Well, it means "good lookin'." I never told that to a single person in my whole life. My ma was French. She gave it to me. That's a real pretty name. Beauregard. You are, too. Real beauregard. Everybody just calls me "Bo." - Cherry. - Cherie. It was real nice the way you made everybody shut up in there, like you had respect for me. You made them have respect too. - I liked that. - You did? - Yes. - How about me? Did you like me too? Well, when I first saw you, I thought you was some kind of a hooligan, yellin' and stompin' like that. But when I realized you was doin' it for me, I was attracted to you. Attracted? You was? - I still am. - You still are? Really attracted? Uh-huh. 'Course, it's only what you might call a physical attraction. Physical? I mean, you're so big and strong and, well, so darn healthy-lookin'. Guess I am in pretty good shape for the rodeo. 'Course, you gotta be when you're competin' in all five class-A events. Cherry. Beauregard. Pardon me, sir. Have you seen Cherie? That little gal you was settin' with? No. She went off with another customer. I was worried. It's about time for the second show. Virge, I want you to be the first to know. After all, it was really your idea. What was? I found me that gal, just like you said. Cherry and me, we're engaged. - We're what? - Engaged. Virge, I want you to meet Cherry. Cherry, this here's old Virge. - He'll be livin' with us, of course. - We already met. Now wait a minute. Somebody's got the wrong idea around here. What do you mean, Cherry? My name ain't Cherry. I told you, it's Cherie. I can't say it fancy like that. Anyway, what's the matter with Cherry? Well, it ain't dignified. - Bo... - Now, tomorrow afternoon is the preliminaries for the rodeo. We'll get married out there! Married? Out where? At the rodeo. Tomorrow night, after the finals, we'll all three of us catch the bus back. Bo, you don't know nothin' about this gal! I know she's my angel. That's good enough for me. Well, your angel was hustlin' me for drinks! Sixty cents a shot! And come to find out, it weren't whiskey she was drinkin'. It was tea! Of course it was, Virge! Angels don't touch no liquor! Cherry, I just gotta kiss you again! I can't help myself! (PATRONS LAUGHING) Stop! Cut it out! - Everybody's looking. - Let 'em look! Ain't no crime for two people to show a little affection, especially when they're gettin' married tomorrow! Cherry, I just know we're gonna be very happy together... Till death do us part! Hey, I better get goin'. I gotta get into bed. Virge, come on. Let's get goin'. Cherry, we're gonna make all the rest of the plans in the mornin'. But meanwhile, for a weddin' present... I'm gonna get you a deep freeze, or an electric washer, or any other major appliance you want. Good night, darlin'. (PATRONS LAUGHING) Come on, honey. You're on again. What's the matter? What happened? You know somethin'? I'm not quite sure. This whole thing is probably my fault. I told you it was about time you started learnin' somethin' about women. Now, I ain't sayin' this particular gal you picked out ain't a good one to practice on. But a fella can't go around marryin' the first gal he meets. Why not? You better get your mind on that rodeo. Fellas back at the ranch bet their money on you. Anyhow, she has no intention of marryin' you. Oh, yes, she has, Virge. She's got a physical attraction to me. - Oh. - She said so herself. Oh! - Virge? - Yeah, Bo? What's the difference between a, a physical attraction and, well, just a regular attraction? Well, a gal can be attracted to a fella for lots of reasons. His mind, for instance. - His mind? - Sure. Like if he's smart or reads poetry or somethin'. - No kiddin'? - That's right. - I can read and write. - Mm-hmm. I don't know no poetry. But I can recite the Gettysburg Address. Would that count? It might, Bo. I doubt it, but it might. Magic has me in its spell That old bah-duh duh-buh-duh-duh-duh-duh I should stay away but what can I do I hear your name Cherry! And I'm aflame Yes? Good morning, ma'am! Aflame with such... Say, wait a minute! Wait a minute! BO: I told you, we're gonna be married! I'm just wakin' her up for breakfast. Cherry. (KNOCKING) Cherry, wake up! It's me, Beauregard! Good morning, Cherry! She didn't say nothin' to me about gettin' engaged. Why's it so dark in here? Let's get a little air. I don't allow callers... Cherry, come on, get outta bed. We gotta be in time for the parade at 10:30. - Listen, young man! - Ma'am, I don't want trouble from you. How do I know that you're engaged to her? Cherry, wake up and tell her you know me! What? Oh, it's you! - You see? She knows me. - Oh, for the love... - I don't know what's goin' on in this... - Cherry? Come on, come on. Get outta bed. We gotta get goin' because we're gonna be married today, and we got a lot of things to do. What's the idea of bustin' in here like that? What time is it, anyway? Well, it's after 9:00. I've been up for hours. - 9:00? I didn't even get to bed till 5:00! - 5:00? 5:00? Well, no wonder you're so pale and white. Cherry, know what that is out there? That's the sun. (CHUCKLES) Will you get outta here 'fore I call the police? You shouldn't stay up so late like that. When we get up to the Suzie Q Ranch, we're gonna be in the old sack every night at 7:30. Listen, Bo. I think we oughta get somethin' straight. I have no intention in the world of marryin' you, so you might as well get it out of your head. We're gonna talk all that over on the way to the parade. You see, Cherry, the whole problem is that you just haven't had time yet to get attracted to my mind. Your mind? I know all about your mind I ever wanna know. And do you know I can say the Gettysburg Address? Come bustin' in here like a wild Indian. Sometime... Cherry? Well, what? "Four score and seven years ago, "our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, "conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition..." Bo? "...that all men are created equal. "Now we're engaged in a great civil war, "to determine whether that nation or any nation..." Bo, listen... "...so conceived and so dedicated can long endure." Bo... "We are met here on a great battlefield of that war." I hate parades. I'm not goin'. "The world will not long remember, nor little note, what we say here, "but it will never forget what they did here." Bo? "Rather it is for us, the living..." Please let me sleep. "...to be so concentrated and so dedicated..." If you go any further, Mr. Lincoln, you're gonna miss the parade. (APPLAUSE) (MARCH) - Elliot, got anything? - Great. - Would you hold it, please, miss? - Hold it? We're from Life. Life Magazine? That's right. "Life Goes To A Rodeo." Or "rodeo" to you. They wanted me to ride in the parade too, but I said, "If I ride in it, how can I see it?" Just come right in here, Cherry. Excuse us, everybody. Come on up here. We're gonna see us a parade real good. Can't we find a place to sit down, Bo? I'm tired. You didn't let me get no sleep. - You hop right up here on my shoulder. - No! You can rest, and see the parade at the same time! - You put me down! - Hey, this is a nice arrangement! Can you see everything? - Too much. - (LAUGHS) Boy, look at that! I'm glad I'm not in this parade, so I can see it. Here comes some of Daniel Boone's men! We're seein' us a real hootenanny of a parade, ain't we, Cherry? Look at them boys dancin' it up. Ain't they talented? Ain't they resplendent, Cherry? Hey, Cherry, look! There's cowgirls, and they got... Hi! Hi! Where is he? - You gonna marry him? - No! Then you're gonna go to the rodeo? - No. - Then what you gonna do? Run away. Hey, what's goin' on up there, Cherry? Who were you signalin' at? To... Vera. She's a friend of mine. She's gonna get two tickets to the rodeo this afternoon to watch you. Get two tickets for the rodeo. Two? Hey, there's ol' Virge! Ya-hoo! - Whoa! Stop it! - Virge, here we are! We been watchin' you, Virge, and you're doin' just... Hello, there. Stop it, Bo! Oh, sorry, lady. You're over there in the bleachers. Over there? But it's so much nicer right here in the shade. That's right. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) Come on, honey. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Oh, they got us over here with the livestock. RODEO ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, we go into our first event of the afternoon, cowboy saddle bronc riding. The contestant is required to ride ten seconds until the signal from our timer's horn. (BAND BEGINS PLAYING) That was Duane Howard of Minnewaukin, North Dakota. The second rider up is Guy Weeks. And here's our next rider, Casey Tibbs, five times World's Champion Saddle Bronc Rider, twice All-Around Champion Cowboy of the World. (BUZZER BLARES) Watch the work of our pickup man as he makes the recovery of Casey Tibbs, Fort Pierre, South Dakota. Cherie, wake up! It's him! - Tell him to go away. - No, I mean it's him. He's gonna ride now. Oh, we're at the rodeo. What's that green thing. That ain't green, Virge. You know what that is? It's that old black magic that's gonna make me win VERA: What's that he's got around his neck? Ain't that your scarf? So, that's where it went! RODEO ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a newcomer here this afternoon. - From Timber Hill, Montana, Bo Decker. - Go! (BAND BEGINS PLAYING) - I can't look! - You are stuck on him! I knew it! RODEO ANNOUNCER: Good work, Bo. How about a hand? (CHEERING) Hey, Cherry! Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! - Ha-ha-ha-ha! - You know, I think he is crazy. Sure he is. Crazy as a bedbug. I told you he was. He thinks we're gettin' married this afternoon here at the rodeo. What makes him think that? I don't know. Sure weren't nothin' I said. This mornin' after the parade, he dragged me down to the city hall and bought us a marriage license. You didn't sign nothin', did ya? Well, I had to do somethin'. He was makin' such a fuss in front of all those people. Honey. Ladies and gentlemen, here's a ride to watch. The cowboy has drawn one of the toughest horses in our bareback riding contest. Don't fall off. (CROWD GROANS) - He fell off. - (MOUTHS) VERA: Hey, is that a diamond? Well, it ain't exactly a diamond, but it ain't exactly not a diamond either. He paid $43 for it. - No kiddin'. - Plus tax. He made me take it, but it ain't on my finger. And neither is that wedding ring he bought. It ain't gonna be either. Weddin' ring? Oh, honey. RODEO ANNOUNCER: Cowboys' calfroping is our next contest. This is a race against time, and every second counts. (CHEERING) Notice the work of the horse at all times, keeping the rope snug and tight. I'm just gonna pretend that little ol' calf is Cherry. I'm goin' after her and I'm gonna get her. - When I get her, I'm gonna rope her. - Don't let the calf get away. Get goin', Cherry! RODEO ANNOUNCER: Here's our newcomer again, Bo Decker of Timber Hill, Montana. Was that fast enough for you, Cherry? Yee-hoo! RODEO ANNOUNCER: Who is she, Bo? Come on. Hey, look! Photographers from Life! They're headin' this way. Life Magazine? They're coverin' the rodeo. They almost took my picture this mornin'. Where's my lipstick? Oh! Would you please hand me my lipstick, please? Smile! Basic. Thank you. I didn't have my lipstick on yet! RODEO ANNOUNCER: The most dangerous of all rodeo events is the wild Brahma bull riding contest. And as an extra star in this feature, we have cousin Hugo, our bullfighting chimpanzee. It is Hugo's job to ride on the dummy, and attract the bull over to him. The cowboy clowns are also there to distract the bull and draw him away from the cowboy when he gets bucked off. (CHEERING) Keep your mind on that bull, or you're gonna break your neck. Don't worry about me, Virge. I ain't gonna break my neck. If I was to break my neck, I couldn't get married. If he was to break his neck, that's about the only hope you've got. RODEO ANNOUNCER: Believe it or not, here's our old friend, Bo Decker. He's still wearing that green scarf. Let's hope it brings him luck again in the bull riding. (BAND BEGINS PLAYING) Aah! (SQUEALING) Good riding, Bo. Cherry! Did you see me ride that bull? Cherry! Bo, stop it! (LAUGHTER) Cherry! He don't have no manners at all. No, but he's got somethin' else. And he's gonna get some little gal. You just watch. Well, it ain't gonna be me. Besides, how can we get married? He ain't made no arrangements. Silly. Cherie, look. Ain't that a preacher? Oh, my goodness! Excuse me, please. Excuse me, please. Hey, where's the cowboy that's gettin' married? What? - Getting married? Here at the rodeo? - That's right. - Elliot. - Boing! There she is! The cowboy's girl. RODEO ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Bo Decker is also entered in our bulldogging contest. Get him, get him, get him! (CHEERING) - How do you get outta here? - The exit's over there. But to get to it, you gotta go around the corral, then you... Where you goin'? Hey! Cherie! You shouldn't be crossin' there! Cherry, where you goin'? Cherry, what's goin' on here? Wait a minute, Cherry! Where you goin'? Oh, my shoe! Oh, I'll get it! Cherry, come back! Stop her! Hey, somebody hold this thing for me! I'm tellin' ya, she ain't here, she ain't been here, and I don't know when she's comin' back. I don't believe you! She's here someplace. I know she is. VIRGE: Bo, if she ain't here, she ain't here. Now we gotta go get some supper, and get your mind clear for the finals tonight. I don't care about the finals! I want Cherry! - Cherry! - Ma'am. He don't give up that easy. If I'm not careful, I'm gonna end up in East No Place, Montana, with nothin' but him and a bunch of cows. Hey, what are you doing? We're gonna pack your stuff and we're gonna stash your suitcase at the club, just in case you have to make a quick getaway. I can't go back to the club. That's the first place he'll look. If you don't show up for work, they sure ain't gonna give you no advance. Now listen. He's ridin' in the rodeo. You're safe till it's over anyway. And you just tell that cashier that you gotta have money 'cause your poor old grandmother is sick. My poor old grandmother's sick. I just don't understand that boy. - What's he got on his mind, anyhow? - Me. I'm gonna find her and I'm gonna marry her, and that's all there is to it. You gotta get her off your mind. At least till after the rodeo tonight. - I ain't gonna be in the rodeo tonight. - If you'll go to the rodeo, - I'll find her and hold her for you. - You will? I don't say she's gonna marry you. But I'll have her there at the Blue Dragon when you get through. - Okay, Virge, if you promise! - I promise! My poor ol' grandmother's very sick, so if I could just have an advance. Not without the boss okays it, and he's watchin' the rodeo. He'll be back when it's over. Her grandmother'll be dead by then. Let's you and me have a little drink, miss. C'mon. I'm so dry, I'm spittin' cotton. Two whiskeys, miss. Take it easy. I'm on your side. I don't want him to marry you neither. - You don't? - I sure don't. Oh! I suppose I ain't good enough for him, is that it? I didn't say that. I suppose he's as pure as a bunch of driven snow. As a matter of fact, he is. You trying to tell me... He never even kissed a gal before he met you. You're forgettin' he spent his whole life pretty far out in the country. I know what happens in the country. I'm from the country myself. I've been kissing boys since I was knee high to... Well, that's the point! You're kinda sophisticated for Bo. He sure didn't kiss like it was the first time. Well, Bo picks things up real quick. First time, huh? That's right. Sure ain't never had that honor before. I hate to put you through this, but I promised him I'd keep you here till he got back. Course, I didn't say anything about where you might take a notion to go after that. Oh! Ol' Vera's sure gonna miss you, honey. Oh, what was I supposed to say again? I never was any good at lyin'. It ain't all that complicated. We just sit here and talk to him for a while. Then you turn casually and you say, "Bo, the show is gonna start pretty soon. "I guess I better go powder my nose." And then what do I... And then you go to your dressing room where your suitcase is. You change your clothes, you climb out of the window, and you get down to the bus station. (EXCITED SHOUTING) The rodeo must be over. Wonder what's keepin' Bo? I know what's keepin' him. He's probably arguin' and yellin' and pushin' some poor little helpless animal around. Whatever give you an idea like that, Cherry? (CHUCKLING) Nice to see ya, honey. I was afraid ya got yourself trampled to death in that crowd this afternoon. Where ya been, Bo? Well, I had a couple of errands to run after the rodeo. I bought us three tickets for tonight's bus to Montana. By the way, there's $4,000 that I got for winnin' every event at that there rodeo. 'Cept steer wrestlin'. Would've won that too but they gave me a bum steer. (LAUGHING) Don't give me no credit for that one. One of the other fellas thought it up. Well, Virge, I got our gear all packed up and waitin' outside in a taxi. All we gotta do is stop by Cherry's house and pick up her suitcase. Your nose is kinda shiny, ain't it? Huh? Oh. Oh! Bo, the show's gonna start in just a minute, and, (STAMMERING) I gotta go powder my nose. Why, Cherry? You're not gonna do your show tonight. - I ain't? - No, of course not. - You gotta go pack your suitcase. - Oh, it's already packed. I mean, I, I gotta go powder my nose. Cherry, what's the matter with you? Are you sick or somethin'? No, I ain't sick, Bo. I just can't lie to you and I can't marry ya, and I ain't goin' to Montana with you. And good-bye forever. Cherry, wait a second! Cherry, wait! Cherry! (SCREAMING) You ain't got the manners they give a monkey! I hate you! And I despise you! And give me back my tail! (CHEERING) - BO: (POUNDING ON DOOR) Cherry! - Here's your bag. - Here's your coat and hat. - BO: Cherry! You ain't got time. Change at the bus station. Put on your coat. I'm sorry, Cherry. I didn't mean to rip your tail off. You can sew it back on. Well, good luck, honey. Thanks, Vera. You've been real sweet. Oh, let her go, let her go, Bo! What do you mean, "let her go"? Where's she goin'? Cherry! Cherry! Where'd she go? Ticket to Los Angeles, please. One way. Line 35. MAN: (OVER P.A.) Los Angeles bus leaving from gate two. Bo, Bo! Wait a minute, Bo! Help me unload this stuff. Here, Bo. Forget her, Bo. You'll find somebody else. Hank and Orville was tellin' me about this new schoolmarm who's stayin'... I don't want no schoolmarm! I want Cherry! - Los Angeles bus leaving from gate two. - Cherry! Bo, you just can't take people places like that! There's laws against it, Bo! - This way, straight ahead. - Which... Lady, here's the Los Angeles bus. Please, miss, to the rear of the line. Bus for Helena, Montana, now loading. Gate's closed. - Cherry, don't get on that bus. - No, Bo, no. I'm gonna get her. Ain't gonna take "no" for an answer. You ain't goin' over that fence. Please, stand to the rear. You goin' crazy? What do you think you're doing? Anything I ever wanted in this life, I just went out and got! If the ocean was whiskey and I was a duck I'd swim to the bottom and never come up Rye whiskey, rye whiskey rye whiskey I cry If I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die So if I get boozy My whiskey's my own And them that don't like me can leave me alone Rye whiskey, rye whiskey rye whiskey I cry If I don't get rye whiskey I surely will die I'll eat when I'm hungry I'll drink when I'm dry I'm sorry to wake you, but could you help me? - What's the matter? - I'm being abducted. Abducted? You know, like kidnapped, by him. Oh, that's awful! What are you gonna do? I thought maybe as soon as we got someplace, I'd ask the driver to stop and let me off. But we've been ridin' for hours and hours, and we still don't seem to be no place at all. Not only that, I'm freezing to death. I don't have much on under my coat. You mean just your underthings? No, it's my costume, but it's just a bitty old thing. Now it doesn't even have its tail. It's what? Its... Oh, it's a long story. You're shivering! Don't you have anything warm to put on? Will you help me change? Of course. - Here, hold this up for me, will you? - Sure. Cherry? Cherry, where are you? Cherry! Cherry? What's goin' on up here? Get away from me! Can't you see I'm gettin' dressed? Bo, ain't you caused enough trouble for one night? Come back and sit down! I can't figure it out. Why don't she like me? Why? Of course, if you loved him, it wouldn't be so bad. Yeah, but I don't. Not at all? There are some gals who don't like to be pushed and grabbed and lassoed and drug into buses in the middle of the night. How else was I gonna get her on the bus? Well, I'm askin' ya. Go to sleep! I don't know why I keep expecting myself to fall in love, but I do. Well, I know I expect to someday. I'm seriously beginning to wonder if there's the kind of love I have in mind. What's that? I don't know. You see, I've been goin' with guys since I was about 12. Honest? I almost married a cousin when I was 14. But Pappy wouldn't have it. I never heard of anyone marrying so young! Down in the Ozarks, we don't waste much time. I sure am glad, though, I never married my cousin Malcolm. 'Cause he turned out real bad, just like Pappy predicted. But I sure was crazy about him at the time. And I've been losing my head about some guy ever since. Bo was the first one that ever wanted to marry me, since my cousin Malcolm. Naturally I'd like to get married and have a family and all them things. But you've never been in love? I don't know. Maybe I have and I didn't know it. That's what I mean. Maybe I don't know what love is. I want a guy I can look up to and admire. But I don't want him to browbeat me. I want a guy who'll be sweet with me. But I don't want him to baby me either! I just gotta feel that whoever I marry has some real regard for me aside from all that loving stuff. You know what I mean? I think so. This storm is getting terrible! There's Grace's lights. I think we're gonna make it. You can sneak off when I get off. I can if that wild man don't wake up. Sure awful rough. I wish I had my chains on. Shh! (TIRES SPINNING) (GEAR CLUNKS) Shh! This is as close as I can get. You're gonna have to walk from here. GRACE: You sure picked some night for traveling. Come on! Come on in! Whew! Ah. Grace, this is Cherie. We gotta find some place for her to hide. - She's being abducted. - She's been what? You know! Kidnapped! Yes, that's right. By a man in the bus, a cowboy. He's out there asleep, so if I could stay until the bus pulls out again, I sure would appreciate it. Bus ain't pullin' out. Huh? Road's all closed up ahead. I got word to hold that bus here. The highway gang's out, but it may take the rest of the night. Oh! The rest of the night? Mr. Bus Driver, are we gonna stay here very long? 'Cause my aunt and uncle are supposed to meet us, you know. Don't you think we oughta wake those cowboys up too? - Well... - It's cold! - Well, look what the cat dragged in! - Hiya, Grace. Who's that with ya? Ain't they cute! They're gonna visit their aunt in Helena. Looks like they're gonna visit their Aunt Grace, for tonight anyway. Everybody is. Highway's all closed up ahead. Oh, now, ain't that too bad! What's this I hear about you carrying a kidnapper on your bus? You mean that cowboy? He ain't kidnappin' nobody. He's asleep. He might freeze out there. Why don't you go out and wake him up? Oh, no! I mean, couldn't you just let him sleep a little longer? He's had a very busy day. Two rodeos and a lot else. Sure. Let him sleep for a while. Kinda works out better for everybody that way. - How soon is the next bus back? - Ain't no busses running tonight. You're all stuck right here. For the time, anyway. You know somethin', Grace? This is the first time you and me have had more than five minutes together. So what? I don't know. I was just thinking about that apartment you got upstairs. Sure would be nice to sit up there for a while, listen to the radio or somethin'. Maybe have a couple of beers. That wouldn't be a hint or somethin', would it? Elma, where is this place we're at now anyway? Oh, about here. It's so little, it's not even on the map. I sure am way off my direction. - Whatcha lookin' at? - Oh, nothin'. Just your hands. You got real big hands. Big all over. - I used to be state wrestling champion. - No kiddin'! I always admire a man who can fight. Hey! Why didn't anybody wake us up? Me and Virge might've froze out there! - Hey, close the door! - Cherry! Cherry! How come you got off the bus without lettin' me know? Shut the door, cowboy! How come you want to slip off the bus, and come in here all by yourself? Where was you brought up? In a barn? That's right! He was! What's the matter with you, mister? You afraid of a little fresh air? The man's right, Bo. It's cold out there. That don't give him no right to insult my manners. No man ever had to tell me what to do, did he, Virge? Did he? You opened the door, you should've closed it. That's all I'm sayin'. The door's closed now, so what ya arguin' about? Cherry, let's you and me sit down and have a... That's your suitcase, ain't it? For cryin' out loud, will you leave me be? Well, ain't that your suitcase? Yes, that's my suitcase. Grr. What'd you bring it in here for? Cherry, I'm asking ya a civil question. What did you bring your suitcase in here for? - Now, tell me! - You keep away from me, Bo Decker. Bo, will you... Virge, you keep outta this. This is between me and Cherry. Was you tryin' to fool me again? Is that what it was? - Take your hands off of me, Bo! - Tell me. Cherry, you tell me! Okay, cowboy, leave the lady alone. You better keep outta this, if you know what's good for ya. - It ain't none of your business. - I ain't so sure about that. A bus driver's kind of like the captain of a ship. The welfare of the passengers is his responsibility. - If anything happens in the bus... - We ain't in a bus! We're in a bus stop! This is an official, authorized bus stop! - Ain't it, Grace? - When the sign's up. You still got no right interfering between two people gonna get married! We ain't gettin' married! That's what I've been tryin' to tell ya. But you're too bullheaded and mean to listen! Cherry, I'm tellin' you, you're gonna marry me, and I ain't gonna discuss it no more! There must be a preacher around here someplace, ain't there? Down the road a ways, but, he's asleep. We're gonna wake him up, and put him to work. - Aah! Help, everybody! - Oh, shut up! I'll make ya a good husband. You'll have nothin' to be sorry about. - No! No! - I'm telling you, cowboy. Put her down! - Open the door, Virge. - No! No! Go ahead, open the door! I ain't gonna open it, Bo. - You ain't? - No! You've been against this right from the beginning! That's right. First 'cause I figured the lady wasn't good enough for you. But now 'cause I figure you ain't good enough for her! That's how it is, cowboy. Now, are you gonna put her down? You're gonna get out of my way! You're gonna have to fight me first. I love a good fight. - One thing I can't stand is a bully. - Who says I'm a bully? I do! Quiet! A man's got to fight for what he wants! There's a big difference between a fighter and a bully, Bo. But there's only one way you're gonna learn it. For once in your life, somebody's gotta beat the livin' tar out of ya! Go to it, Captain. He's ripe for it. I'd do it myself if I was big enough. But you ain't big enough! And neither is he! Ain't no man ever got the best of me, and there ain't gonna be. I'm willin' to try, cowboy! Just step outside. Delighted! Oh, Grace, make 'em stop! Look, cowboy, why don't you save yourself a lot of trouble? - Go tell that little girl you're sorry. - I ain't sorry! He never ain't! That's his whole trouble! You stay outta this, Virge. I had just about enough of you tellin' me what's right and what's wrong. No, you ain't! You can stand just a little bit more! Virge! What're you doin'? I'm startin' a fight. He's gonna finish it for me. But remember this, Bo. Every time he hits ya, it's me hittin' ya! Do ya hear that? It's me! And it'll be me hittin' ya back! Move over. I'm gettin' cold. How 'bout that! And that... And that! You're doin' great, mister! - Gouge him, cowboy! Bite him! - Make them stop! Now you two come away from this window! You don't wanna watch things like that or you're gonna grow up mean like all my brothers and my cousins too! Now you sit down there and behave yourselves! You oughta be in bed! Grace has a big bed upstairs, and a sofa too. (GRUNTS) All right, boys, lay off them gas pumps! (PANTING) Had enough, kid? Go put your coat on, honey. This is gettin' good. Cherry? Virge, make him stop 'fore somebody gets killed! Give up! Come on, give up! You ain't got a chance. You had enough? No, he ain't. Not till he promises to apologize to everybody in the place. And quits molestin' that poor little girl. You hear what he said? - C'mon, Bo, you're whipped. Admit it! - Okay. Bo? Get away, damn it! How 'bout the promise, Bo? - Is she gone? - She's gone. - Okay, I promise. - All right. He'll be all right. Come on, Bo, the storm is over. I'm sorry it had to be like this. It's all over now. Come on inside and wash up, get some coffee. Come on! You can't stay out here. I, I can't go in there. She's seen me get whipped. Carl, honey, you was just plain tremendous! CARL: Eh! I think maybe I earned me a bottle of that cold beer you got in the icebox upstairs. Snowplow's out. Shouldn't be too much longer. C'mon, Bo, cheer up. Bus'll be leavin' pretty soon. We'll be back on the ranch tomorrow. I don't care if I ever see that ranch again. Lonesomest durn place I ever did see. It's like goin' back to a graveyard. Good mornin', honey. They're sleepin' just fine. Must've read myself to sleep. Such an interesting story. - Can I have a cup of coffee? - Sure, honey. Elma just run it through. - Bo? - Yeah? This'll be a good time to keep your promise. - Why should you be so scared? - Who's scared? I'm gonna do it. Just give me a little time, that's all. But I warn ya, it ain't gonna do no good less'n you really mean it. - I mean it. - All right then. Go ahead. Ma'am, I want to apologize. For what? - For causing all that ruckus. - Ah! You don't need to apologize to me, cowboy. I love a good fight. You're welcome at Grace's Diner anytime. I mean anytime! Thanks. I must've acted like a hoodlum. I apologize. Oh, that's all right. Thank you, miss. Have I gotta wake him up? No, he can wait. Virge, I can't do it. I just can't do it. Why not? I can't face up to her. She's seen me get beat. You made me your promise. You owe that girl an apology whether you got beat or not, and you're gonna say it to her. Now, go on, Bo. Go on! Well, don't watch! I'll do the dishes, honey. - I can do 'em, Grace. - No, you go on with the kids' breakfast. - Cherry? - Yes? Cherry, it wasn't right of me to do what I did to you, treatin' you that way, draggin' you on the bus, and tryin' to make you marry me whether you wanted to or not. Do you think you can ever forgive me? I guess I've been treated worse in my life. Well, I reckon that's all there is to be said. I wish you luck, Cherry. I wish you the same, Bo. Here's your bandana back. Thanks. Oh! Here's your ring. I wish you'd keep that. All right, Bo. Well, so long. So long. That wasn't so bad, was it? Why don't we sit down and have ourselves some breakfast? I ain't hungry. - Just some coffee then. - I couldn't get it down. (PHONE RINGING) Phone! Turn the water off, honey. Grace's Diner. What? Oh, it is? Okay, I'll tell him. Hate to wake him, but the road's cleared. - Hey, Carl. - Huh? The road's cleared. But you're gonna have to put your chains on. - It's still awful slick. Elma? - Okay. Hey, Elma, better wake the kids up. The road's clear, folks. Bus'll be ready to leave soon as I get the chains on and pull it up front. Anybody wanna help me? Sit here, Bo. I'll help him. Bo? Yeah? I just wanted to tell you something. It's kinda personal and embarrassing too. But I ain't the kind of girl you thought I was. What do you mean, Cherry? Well, I guess a lot of people'd say I led a real wicked life, and I guess I have too. What are you tryin' to tell me? Well, I just figure that since you met me at the Blue Dragon, that you just took it for granted that I'd had other boyfriends 'fore you. You had? Yes, Bo. Quite a few. Virge tried to tell me that, but I wouldn't believe him. Well, it's true. So you can see, it... You're better off, 'cause I ain't the kind of gal you thought I was at all. (BUS ENGINE REWING) I'll go wake the children. Cherry, would I be molestin' you if I was to tell you somethin'? No. Since you brought the subject up, you are the first gal that I ever had anything to do with. I never thought I'd hear myself sayin' that, but I said it. Virge told me that, but I couldn't hardly believe him. That's the truth. You see, I lived all my life on a ranch and... I guess I just didn't know anything about women... 'Cause they're different from men. Well, naturally. All ready to roll, folks. Feelin' better, cowboy? I ain't the happiest critter that's ever been born. I feel a little shook up myself. How 'bout shaking hands? Well... Go ahead, Bo. He's just tryin' to be friends. - I don't mind. - No hard feelin's? No hard feelin's. There's a nice state, miss. Montana. How 'bout a cup of coffee for the road, Grace? - Nice fella, Bo. - Maybe I'll think so someday. Maybe we'd better be boarding the bus. - (TUNING GUITAR) - Cherry? Hi, Bo. Cherry, you won't be gettin' on this bus. I know that I promised not to molest ya, but if you give your permission that it'd be all right, I... I'd like to kiss you good-bye. I'd like for you to kiss me, Bo. I really would. - Bo! - What? I think this time it oughta be different. Oh! Golly, when you kiss somebody for serious, it's kinda scary, ain't it? Yes, it is. - Here they are. All breakfasted. - I'm still hungry. - See you Wednesday. - Keep that beer on ice, will ya, Grace? Maybe next time I'll get a chance to finish it. All aboard! - Come on, kids. - I turned down the heater. Honey, will you throw this water on the fire? Sure. This bus stop is closed as of now! (YAWNING) Cherry? Yes? Virge has been figurin' things out. And, well, he says that seeing as how you had all them other boyfriends before me, and seeing as I never even had one single gal friend before you, well, Virge figures that between the two of us it kinda averages out to things being proper and right. That's what Virge thinks. What do you think, Bo? Well... Well, I've been thinkin' about them other fellas, Cherry, and, well, what I mean is, I like you the way you are, so what do I care how you got that way? Bo! That is the sweetest, tenderest thing anyone ever said to me. It's awful hard for a fella after he's been turned down once, to get up enough guts to try again. You don't need guts, Bo. I don't? That's the last thing in this world you need. Well, anyhow, I just don't have any now. So I'll just have to tell you what I feel in my heart. Yes? I still wish you was goin' back to the ranch with me, more than anything I know. You do? Yeah, I do. I'd go anywhere in the world with you now. Anywhere at all! (STAMMERING) You would? Anywhere at all! You, you would? - Yes, I would! - You would? I would, I would, I would! (LAUGHING) You would? You would? You would? Yes, I would. I would. Virge! Oops! She's gonna marry me! Ain't it wonderful when somebody so terrible turns out to be so nice? Our ranch is gonna be the nicest place in the world 'cause we're gonna have an angel on it! - Here's your map. - Here's your bag. Oh, this ol' thing! That's right, Cherry! I'll show you the way to Montana! Hey, Captain! You got yourself another passenger. - Okay! - Come on, Virge. - Wait a second, Bo. - Doggone it, come on! - Now listen! - Come on, Virge, what you waitin' for? You asked for a second! You gotta hear me. Bo, I ain't goin'. You ain't what? You don't need me to look after you. Fact is, you got someone you gotta look after. Here's your wedding ring. Virge, I wish you'd come. I liked you long 'fore I ever liked Bo. Gettin' late, folks. You better hurry. The bus can't wait all day. Doggone it, Virge! You're my buddy! I ain't gonna let you go. You're comin' with Cherry and me, 'cause we want you to! - Let me be! Let me be! - Bo! Bo! You just can't do it that way. You just can't! If he don't wanna come, you can't make him. Whatever I got left up there, the boys can have it. - Bye, Bo. - C'mon, Cherry, let's make it fast. Well, Cherry! You're liable to freeze to death in that skimpy little thing! But what about you? You'll need something. Ya-hoo! Uh-oh. Bye, everybody! Bye! Bye! You can have my everything My house, my money, my wedding ring And in the bargain I'll throw in me If you will marry me
