Thank you to my mom. ( CHUCKLES ) Why are you sitting in the dark? Where were you last night? Uh... i-I was studying Like I told you. You haven seen Angelina in weeks. I just figured that studying with angel would... um, just distract me a little bit. He already told me. Just where have you been going? Bill... i asked you a question. The library. What... A guy tries to do the right thing, And I get jumped for it? Are you trying to do the right thing? Yes... ( STAMMERING ) Your father's finished with his questions. Go on upstairs and study, baby. Well, You've managed to ruin a perfectly lovely evening. BILL: Just trying to make him live up to his responsibilities. He only comes home long enough to eat And to ask for more money. SHARON: Like your daughter's home more? My son's an athlete, And one day he's going to be important. He's important now, Sharon. Has it ever occurred to you that Jason Doesn't even wanna be an athlete? Then why is he trying so hard to make captain? He's not. If you'd come to any Of his track meets, you'd know. He... He'll never be captain. Your daughter's the loser. And she dresses like trailer trash. ( SOBBING ) BILL: If Ashleys mother was home once in a while... Oh, please. I'm up in this dump more than I care to be. Charming. If a... Maybe, Maybe if we got this place together... Let's get you back. ( SIGHS ) No life, huh? This is gross.

You weren't home. Why'd you tell him we haven't been studying together? I didn't know you told him we were. Look, I... I just can't have any more hassles right now. Don't shut me out. Mmm. Let's go somewhere. Is your mom home? She leaves for work in about an hour. I don't think I can wait that long. Promise me you'll come over this time. I love you. Promise. Believe it. ( SNIFFLING ) That is one hot little piece of ass. You shut up about her. You hear me? ( GRUNTING ) That's not how you talk to me. ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Thanks. You, too, Willy. You're welcome. You'll make a terrific virgin Mary. Shut up. ( STAMMERING ) who said I was a virgin? I was talking about the play. And being a virgin is bad because... why? 'Cause nobody else is. There may be one or two. And what play are you talking about? Hello? The Christmas play. Mary, baby Jesus, Wise men. You auditioned for it. ( LAUGHS ) Remember? No one does that kind of play anymore. It's not politically correct. ( CHUCKLES ) Oh. I ran across this when I was cleaning. Wait. Sharon was in the band with my mom and dad? Evidently. She was pregnant and depressed. Her boyfriend left her. She didn't want the baby. The plan was for your mother to watch after both kids While Sharon filled in with the band. How do you know all this? Your father asked me to look over things So I wouldn't throw out anything important. This seemed important. And... kinda personal. So I stopped reading. Thanks. Would you be willing to do me a favor? That depends. There's a bunch of kids down at the shelter Who don't know it's not politically correct to have a Christmas play. They'd really like to have one, And I could really use a good acting coach. I can't act. ( GRUNTS ) Huh. I... What makes you think that's mine? ( CHUCKLES ) You see? You can give quite a performance. So, I have no choice. No. But I think you'll like it. It's three days a week, and a half-Day Saturdays. ( SNIFFLING ) Come back to bed and hold me. You could at least help me with the bed. You helped mess it up. ( SIGHS ) Don't be mad, angel. Do you still love me, Jason? ( SIGHS ) You're the only girl I dated since the 7th grade. You never say it. Uh... You've been my lady Since I first saw you at the Halloween party Rolling around on the floor in that stupid pumpkin costume. ( CHUCKLES ) ( SIGHS ) I'm pregnant. You're kidding, right? No. I did the test. Three times. What are you going to do? We could get married in Kentucky on account of I'm pregnant. Kentucky? Are you out of your gourd? We can't keep it. What do you mean? Give me a break. What do you want me to do? What we always talked about. You should've been more careful. "Careful" works both ways. What... What about all your talk About us being together forever? I didn't mean like this week! And besides, we have no money. You can make good money as a carpenter. You're great at it. Angel, baby... this... just isn't a good time To get married. You can see that, can't you? ( SIGHS ) All right, I'll get the money for the abortion. ( SIGHS ) Geez, all anybody ever wants out of me is money. That is not true! I love you, Jason.

I wasn't asking for things. Just advice. Well, I'm sorry I can't help you. Mr. Evans, You've been told before We cannot have that horrible smell in here. They're sanding down in the shop. And if you don't want your backdrop covered in sawdust, I can't do it there. Yeah, well, you can't do it here, either. There's nowhere else. Maybe you'd rather I quit. Fine, As long as you return the paint and supplies You were advanced for your personal use. Good-Bye. ( SIGHS ) Do I know you? You look familiar. You don't. Are you always this friendly? Only when I've just been fired. Oh, let me give you a hand. I'm Ashley. Jonathan. Oh. ( CHUCKLES ) Thanks. JONATHAN: I know it's a mess, but can I give you a lift? Are you kidding? It's a real car! Is it yours? Actually, it's a van. It's not completely paid for yet, But it's more or less mine. ( VAN DOORS SHUT ) I'll get that for you. Oh. Thank you. ( CLICKS TONGUE ) You're, um... different. I'll... take that as a compliment. So, you do, like, what? Stage painting? Um, well, you know, Blackman needed some cheap labor, And I needed some supplies and a space to work. Course, now I don't have either. I have an idea. I'll alert the media. ( CHUCKLES ) ( ENGINE STARTS ) Your line. Hey. Hey. Uh, guys, do you mind helping me out a little bit? Yeah, yeah. Thank you. ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) uh, Mac, This is Jonathan. Jonathan, this is the guy that I was telling you about. Hey. Don't tell me. Ashley offered you a place to work If you do a simple backdrop for our play. Yeah. Uh, so are you in charge here? Allegedly. I'm just a volunteer. Uh, what do you need? ( SIGHS ) an area that's off-Limits Would be really helpful. Yeah. This way. Okay, good job, everybody. I'll be right back. Memorize your lines. Ms. Lane, Kevin took my script to the bathroom And flushed it, but it wouldn't go down. We'll see about that. Jonathan? Would you mind going to the little boys' room And retrieving Darlenes script back, please? ( CHUCKLES ) Hey, um, M-Maybe after we're finished today, I could give you a ride home? Unless you have, like, other plans Or something. No! I mean, yes. I never have plans. I-I mean I don't have plans today. I... That is... plans to rehearse, But nothing after that. ( SIGHS ) I'd love a ride. Okay. ( MOUTHING SILENTLY ) Has Jason left already? I couldn't wake him. He's still upstairs. Don't talk with your mouth full. Have you seen my diamond earrings? You didn't borrow them or anything, did you? No, I haven't. You've been looking nice recently. Well, I have been... I've been talking to this guy, and... Ahh. Yeah, he's... Oh, just a sec. Hello? Are you serious? What?! I needed those boards, like, yesterday. How else are we gonna motivate these people to go green? Yes! Motivation, okay? What a concept. ( SQUEALS ) Where have you been, girl? You haven't answered any of my calls. I've been worried. I'm not living at home anymore, so I just... left my phone there. Where are you staying? Are you all right? You look fabulous. Thanks. You do, too. Uh... do you wanna do something tonight? I have to figure out how to costume 17 kids With no money. Wanna help? No, I don't think so. Really gotten carried away With this whole volunteering thing, huh? Yeah, the kids love doing it. It'll be fun. Besides, we need to talk. Not really. Just... At least not yet. See you around, though. Okay. I've... really missed you. Yeah, me too. Hit the showers, men. Hank. Yeah, coach? What's up with lane? Where is he? I... You'll have to ask him, coach. I'm asking you. ( KNOCKING ) Hi, princess. Hey. What's up? So, you know that junk That Mac has been cleaning out of the garage? Can I have it? Why do you want it? To sell. You know that Mack and I Have been working on this Christmas play. Mac is too old for you. Dad. Give me some credit. Ew. ( CHUCKLING ) Okay. Ah, whatever you can make off the stuff in the garage Is yours to keep. Something else? Well, I... found this poster of your band in the garage. You guys used to rock. You were hot. ( CHUCKLING ) Ashley. How would you like to perform again? I wouldn't. Dad, please? ( SCOFFS ) Our play would be so huge with music. It's just so... almost now. This production needs to be big. BILL: You want me to sing? And play keyboard. Hmm. Well, Sharon and I used to do duets. That's the deal. Me and your mom, 'Kay? Wow. Well, I... I guess that could work. Okay, well, I gotta go. I have a date. I'd like to meet him. This date. So I, uh, Used to sneak into people's back yards And steal charcoal from the barbeques So I could draw my murals on buildings and sidewalks. I was just a kid. Wow. Your neighbors must've loved you. We were never around long enough For anyone to notice one way or the other. ( CHUCKLES ) But you didn't quit. JONATHAN: There was one person who said I had potential. It was the cop that caught me. Made me whitewash the entire side of the building I'd just finished. ( GROANS ) That sucks. Turns out the owner had rented it out to a billboard company for big bucks. That cop got me my first job. Priming building sides for advertising. I've had way worse jobs, though. A way to make money. What made you keep at it? ( SIGHS ) Would've been pretty hard to stop me. Until recently, I only lived and breathed painting. ( GRUNTS ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Hey. Jason's not here. It's nice to see you, too. Can I come in? Yeah, sure. I need to have 17 costumes made for my Christmas play. How much are you paying? Well, actually... nothing. But it's for a good cause. Well, please? We're practically family. ( CHUCKLES ) I barely know you. And your mother won't even stay in the same room with me. Eh... Step-Mother, and consider yourself lucky. Five minutes with her and you're late for the door. Whatever. I still need to earn some cash now. Um, we're having a garage sale next week. Whatever we make, over our expenses, Is yours. Please say you'll help. I'm desperate. Okay, I'll tell you what. If you'll help me with these alterations, That'll give me some time to help you make costumes. I can't sew. I'll teach you. Otherwise, no deal. But I don't have time for anything else. ( CHUCKLES ) welcome to my world. Well, if you really think old "brainless" can help. ( SIGHS ) Wow. What do you think? It's great. So you wanna try it? Um, sure. ( SOFTLY ) I don't... know what I'm doing. ( CHUCKLES ) Just try it. Okay. Stick it in. Mm-Hmm. Does it matter what this... Mm-Mmm. Is this... We're worried about the longer one. # Lift me up Oop. Yeah, just... I don't know. Okay. I don't know. You almost had it. Look... # From the shallows # I am stumblin' a... # # Lonely grave # Lift me up # From your shallows # I am destined to... # live ashamed Got more clothes. Got some clothes for ya. Oh. Okay, wait. Wait. Before you put them down. Right there. Yeah. Just dump 'em. ( SIGHS ) It's a little big. ( MUTTERS ) # Oh, I been sold out ( RETCHING ) # By my best friend # I've been knocked down # # And thrown away ( RETCHING ) # Oh oh I've been sold out # # And mistreated # I've ignited # # A dying flame That looks good. Ready? Okay. You're my mannequin. Okay. Fits really well... Obviously for a smaller person... Have a good day. You, too. Peace out. Okay. You know what? ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Have a good day. Thank you very much. Let it go for seven bucks. What do you say? ASHLEY: Nicki! Hey. You changed your mind. Uh, we could really use your help. Yeah. ( BILL CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY ) I'm just here to see what's been keeping you so busy. Or should I say "who"? I'm so over spending time at bars, And I'm glad you are, too. This is much more fun. Yeah, spare me the pep talk. I know you. Peace offering. ( GAGGING ) ( WHISPERS ) That's vodka. Yeah, I know. It's your fave. I don't do that anymore. Look, neither you or my dad have ever gone too long without a drink. I never knew that you thought I was like your dad. I'm sorry. I don't. Look, it's been a bad week. W-What's going on? You've obviously been too busy to care. I care. You're my best friend! But Nicki, I'm finally doing something that I like. ( STAMMERS ) Do it with me. I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. That's not true. I... I want you to meet someone. You never used to argue with me before. Look, go back to your friends. Like your biker buddy said, I got a lot of heavy decisions to make right now. I'll see you later. ( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( SIGHS ) You've met Ashleys friend before? Maybe. Look, it was over three years ago. Ashley know about that? It's nobody else's business but mine. Bill! Can I have a word with you? All right. ( NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE ) ( SIGHS ) All right. You okay. Come on. It's okay. ( GRUNTS ) It's all right. She'll be all right. She just shouldn't lift anything with her condition. Jason will never speak to me if he thinks I've told anyone. This isn't the sort of thing you can hide for very long. What, you're... You're having Jasons baby? What's you plans? I'll go to school until Christmas break, And then... I don't know. It's not the most complete set of plans I've ever heard. It needs work. What does Jason propose to do? I don't know. Okay, I know Jason can be a real... Weiner at times, But deep down, he really does care. I don't think he wants either of us. He's changed so much. MAN: Hey, could I get some help over here? How long are those people gonna be in our yard? Looks like a garage sale. ( BILL CHUCKLING ) Oh, Sharon. Baby, it is a garage sale. Well it makes us look poor. What is this all about? ( SIGHS ) seeing you selling off All of Amandas old things. It's just... I... I didn't think you'd mind if we sold them. ( SIGHS ) Oh, baby. So nice to see you and Ashley getting along Since she's been doing the play. ( CHUCKLES ) You must be very proud that she's doing something creative, huh? I am. She's certainly home a lot more. Mm-Hmm. I just wish Jason were. And I wish I knew Why our things keep disappearing. My jewelry, money from our wallets. And now my mother's silver. Yeah. Oh, baby. ( GROANS ) Has it ever occurred to you that it might be Jason? He's lost a lot of weight. He does not look good. Bill, I'm tired. Could you just get rid of those people soon? You betcha. Thanks. Hey, Mac. Hey. Let's wrap this up, huh? You got it. Been a long day, huh? Yes, sir. We did really well... So, we have a few more things to sell. ( SIGHS ) Show some mercy! I'm beat. We've made 247 And 63 cents. That means we have enough to buy the rest of the supplies And pay me something. Maybe a little left over For some paint and canvas? ASHLEY: You're just in it for the paint. Yeah... And just for that, I am not letting you take me to pizza tonight. ( CHUCKLES ) Um, actually, can I take a rain check? Something sorta came up. What? Just some personal stuff. Okay. ( SCOFFS ) Don't let me interfere, then. Don't be that way. Here, just take the keys And get all the rest of this... To shelter, And I'll come by and pick it up later, okay? See you later. Bye. You know what? Let's just do the shelter thing another day. You take the truck, get some rest, Go home, and... Ill call you later. Uh... Ashley! Tell me you are not going to follow him. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. I heard coach let you go. Sorry, buddy. Yeah, well you could've covered for me. I've been sick. I tried to cover. He didn't buy it. Everybody knows you got a problem. ( GRUNTING ) Hey. You're my friend! But you're whacked out, man. You need help. Screw you. ( BELL DINGING ) Hey. Hi. Nice shirt. Had these made for everyone in the play. Long time, no see. I didn't think you'd even remember me. I mean, it's been over three years. And that was a pretty wild night. And now you're dating my best friend. ( CHUCKLES ) Small world. Yeah. Thing is, I didn't even know you two knew each other. Is that a problem for you? Well, I mean, Ashleys just been so busy with the play, And she's just beginning to have confidence in herself, And... and you? And me? And, well... that subject just hasn't come up yet. You know me. I'm not gonna say anything. But... she's bound to find out sooner or later. Later would be better. I'd just rather tell her myself. So this a real thing? ( CHUCKLES ) Looks like you've been taking pretty good care of yourself. Had to. Yeah. You had to do it alone. I just couldn't handle any relationships at the time. But... Im here for you now. Don't make any promises you can't keep. This is where I'm staying. Nobody knows but Mac. You're pretty great, Nicole. What's the matter, nick? Ken and the bar boys not enough action for you? You have to steal my boyfriend? ( CHUCKLING ) this is too funny. I know what this must look like, But it's... ( LAUGHING ) I'm laughing. JONATHAN: Wha... ( GRUNTS ) Have a little faith in me. I do. Very little. Wanna reconsider that promise? # If I knew now # What I knew then # If I hadn't forgotten # # What we meant # If I held on # Though the hard times # If I'd done what I needed # # To make things right # I'd know love # # Before I lost it # If I hadn't forgotten # What are you doing in my room? "Sharon's had it so tough. I'm going to take care of Jason until she's ready." Your mother never really loved the band like I did. But she loved me and bill. We thought we were doing what she wanted. What are you talking about? You're a lot like her. You're both so pretty. Are you okay? I watched you sell Amandas things. Have you been stealing my things and selling them, too? Honestly, Sharon, I haven't. No... Why would I? ( SIGHS ) I don't know how to be a good mother. You're starting to freak me out. Why doesn't my son like me? I'm gonna go get daddy. I've pushed bill away. Is he gonna leave me, too? ( SIGHS ) Why don't you just... give me the diary? No! No, no. Sharon! What is going on? ( SIGHS ) Hey, sorry to come by so late. Your mom's not home, right? No, night shift again. What's wrong? Everything. Just take this... Most of it's yours, anyway. Okay, well, come in. Well, where's Jonathan? With my ex-Best friend. And Sharons freaking out about something. I don't know. Will you help me with this? Yeah. ( SIGHS ) Men are pond scum. ( CHUCKLES ) But... what are you gonna do? ( SIGHS ) honestly, I have no idea. But I've talked to god about it, And I know that he's forgiven me, Which is definitely More than I can say for my mom at the moment. So you talk to god directly? Of course. Don't you? Oh, yeah, all the time. ( SIGHS ) All I know is Jason needs to get off the drugs. Himself. He has to decide. Have you decided If you're gonna keep the baby, or... go to school? Both. You can't be anything if you haven't finished school. W-What are you gonna do when the baby comes? Well my mom won't kick me out, And since she works nights, She'll be able to watch the baby during the day. I'm gonna try to work for a store doing alterations So I can be with her at night. I see you've decided it's a girl. ( CHUCKLES ) have you named her yet? Shut up. ( CHUCKLES ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) I'm popular tonight. ( SIGHS ) You must be the angel. I'm a friend of jazz. I know who you are, and you're not welcome here. Who are you?! Leave her alone! ( PHONE RINGING ) Angelina's mom has already called the cops. Your brother's an idiot. GEO: I'm not. Whore's mom works nights. That's when he gets his free piece of ass. Ain't that right? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Jazz... is a very disappointing boy. But... you already knew that, didn't you? Jason's too good for you. ( GASPING ) ( GRUNTS ) Let her go, geo. ( WHIMPERING ) Everybody's here. Nice. I said, "let her go"! ( WHIMPERING ) ( GROANING ) The money, jazz! I don't have it. Search him. ( GRUNTING ) I don't have it! GIRL: What?! ( CHOKING ) Nothin'. Then this is our lucky night. ( ANGELINA GASPS ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( CLOTHING RIPS ) Bitch! ( GRUNTS ) ( YELLS ) ( GUN COCKS ) We're gonna try this again. This time I want a better answer. The money is where? ( GRUNTING ) It's outside. Under the doormat. ( YELPS ) I-I brought it... for the baby. Money. You give that back! ( GROANS ) Money. GEO: Easy. You're okay. ( GROANS ) ( YELLS ) Just chill. ( GASPING ) ( GROANS ) ( SOBBING ) ( CRIES ) Ah! ( SOBBING ) The lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. Oh... he leadeth me beside still waters. He restores my soul. Shut up with that religious shit. Yea, though I walk Though the valley of the shadow of death... GEO: Get the money. I will fear no evil, for you are... ( SOBBING ) Where's the money? ( GASPS ) No. ( YELLS ) ANGELINA: Thy rod and thy staff, They comfort me. ( SOBBING ) O lord, please! ( CRIES ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GEO SCREAMING ) ( ANGELINA PRAYING ) ANGELINA: Though the valley of the shadow of death. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. You prepareth a table in the presence of my enemies. Stop!!! He anointeth my head with oil. Get geo. Let's get out of here. Surely goodness and... And mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. Take it easy. You don't wanna hurt anybody. ( SIREN BLARING ) That everything? Pretty much. Okay. Then, um, We're done with you for now. In the morning, I'll need you to come down, and, uh, Identify the accused. Officer, Do you think we could have our costume money back? The play is only a few days away. Mmm, right now, it's still evidence Confiscated at the scene of the crime. I have to have that money. Those kids are counting on me. I-I gave them my word. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. So what made you come tonight? I needed to see you. But when you weren't home, I figured you were at Angelinas. After your date with Nicole? It wasn't a date. I mean, I wish you would just listen to me so I could... ( JASON SCREAMING ) Let me go! Give him the sedative now. Let me go! Let me go! JASON: Let me go! Is Jason gonna be all right? The gunshot wounds were superficial. He had so many drugs in his system That he's actually doing better now with the transfusions We've given him. Can you help him? I mean, with the addiction? We can monitor and assist with withdrawal now. But ultimately, whether he stays clean, It's up to him. Right. H-How soon can he come home? He could go to jail. But I am recommending That he sign himself into a rehab center. Oh, thank you so much. No, Jason... Jason... Oh. Is not going to jail. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. That's our son lying back there. And that's our daughter that almost got shot. God! Oh, my god. Oh, baby. Oh, god. ( SOBBING ) Sharon. ( SOBBING ) I haven't always done what's right in the past. I know that. But... Bill! Our whole world is falling apart. Let me finish. What I want to tell you, baby... ( SIGHS ) ( CRYING ) Nothing in our lives Has worked out the way we wanted. But believe it or not, baby, I love you, ( WHISPERS ) And I want our family to work. It's up to us to work things out. Look at me. ( SIGHS ) ( SOBBING ) Oh, oh, come here. Come here, baby. ( SOBBING ) My girl. Who's my girl? I am. I really enjoyed practicing with you the other day. ( CHUCKLES ) Me too. More than you know. ( SIGHS ) ( WHISPERS ) I love you. I love you, too. ( GASPS ) I'm caught. I'm caught. Stand still. Stand still. You're making it worse. Stand still. Get it loose, bill! Baby, you're gonna make it... Get it loose! Why'd you come get me anyway, huh? Friends don't let friends drive drunk. SHARON: You can be a real pain in the butt sometimes. But I love you, girl. ( GROANS ) I love you... ( MUTTERS ) okay, Sharon... Oh, oh, it's caught! ( YELLING ) Wait, Sharon... SHARON: Amanda, look out! ( HORN HONKING ) ( SCREAMING ) Calm down. I'm here. ( SOBBING ) Oh, baby. What is the matter? ( SOBBING ) ( WHISPERS ) what is the matter? I was just trying to hug her. ( SNIFFLES ) All my fault. It was all my fault. No. It was an accident. I forgive you. You've got to forgive yourself. ( WHIMPERS ) Okay? I can't. I loved her so much. Oh, baby. We both did. But that was another life. You're not leaving? Now? What about me? You're off to a good start. I lost the money for the play, My best friend and my boyfriend are cheating on me, And Angelina and Jason are in the hospital. ( CHUCKLES ) and now you're leaving. See you at the shelter. Won't be the same. Nothing ever is. But you've got 17 kids counting on you. ( SIGHS ) I'm gonna go see Angelina right now. I'll catch up with you later. Mac? Will you check on Jason for me? Um, make sure that he's okay? If he needs anything. I'll do better than that. ( CHUCKLES ) You think visiting hours apply to chairs? Where'd you get that? From your friends down at the shop. It's a piece of trash. No. Like you, it's a real piece of work. And, like you, it's just not finished yet. Although, it looks considerably better than you at the moment. You think they'll let me work on it? At the rehab center? Sure. They're... bound to need better chairs down there. So what's next? None of your business. Who are you, anyway? A friend of Angelinas. How is she? Nobody tells me anything around here. They treat me like a criminal. ( CHUCKLES ) What's so funny? You are a criminal. I did it for angel. So she could keep the baby. They didn't tell you? She lost the baby. She said you didn't want it. Look, uh... thanks for the rocker. ( SIGHS ) Just, please... Just leave me alone. This is between angel and me. We'll work it out. Maybe. Maybe not. She hasn't regained consciousness yet. The doctors don't expect her to make it. ( SIGHS ) Please! Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Just please... just help me. Help you do what? Just gotta see angel. And please just talk to somebody. If you're really her friend, You know she'll want me to be there. She's all alone. Just please let me see her. She doesn't need your guilt right now. She needs your love, Your faith, And your prayers. Look... I know that I am not worth her little finger... but she's the only person that I really loved. ( GASPS ) She always wanted me to say that to her, But I never did. I'll see what I can do. You know you can make a difference if you're willing to change. The greatest man in the universe was a simple carpenter. And his life... changed this planet. ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR SHUTS ) Another volunteer. ( SIGHS ) Hi, I'm Nicki. Watch the sticky fingers. I got a heavy date tonight. What is this sack you are wearing? I'm Mary, the virgin. And this is my costume. Well, no wonder. You're never gonna get a guy looking like that. Hey, makeovers are what I do. Come on. ( SIGHS ) I'd prefer you didn't bring her here. Has anyone ever told you how extremely irritating you can be? ( SIGHS ) It wasn't a date! In two weeks, Nicole is going to have to testify Against her own father in court. What does that have to do with you? My mom left us when I was a kid. My dad turned into a lush. I used to go by the bars after school to help work off his bill. Nicole used to come by and pick up her old man. He was usually passed out in a corner somewhere. It was kind of a regular routine. We never really talked much. Well, One day, my old man started a fight. I tried stopping him and ended up getting hammered Between him and Nicoles dad. Bartender called the police, And all of us were hauled off to jail. Nicole and I were given a choice. Could go back home, Or we could press charges And have to live as a ward of the state. Nicole was younger, so she went back home. I left and... ( CHUCKLES ) I never looked back When I was old enough, I left the state home, And I've been supporting myself ever since. Her dad turned into a mean drunk. She's been living on his unemployment, Getting meals from guys, Shoplifting, whatever. Well if it was that bad for Nicole, Then why did she take me to bars? It's what she knows. It was way better than staying at home with her old man. Can you help her? Be easier if... she had a few friends around. ( SIGHS ) I will be. Sorry. ( FOOTSTEPS ) Look, am I gonna have to fix all these costumes by myself? I mean, look at them. Without me, you would have no fashion sense. Zip. Nada. I mean, really? Come on... Oh... Okay. I get it. Do you think you could help With makeup, too? Duh. And can we get, like, little halos or something? I mean, you can't really be an angel without them. Don't see why not. Just give me tin foil And lots of glitter. ( GRUNTING ) I'll be right outside. ( VENTILATOR PUMPING ) ( GASPING ) I'm so sorry, angel. ( SNIFFLES ) I know... I know I screwed up big-Time. Yeah. ( SIGHS ) ( SOBBING ) you never did anything In your entire life to deserve this. I-I love you so much, baby. ( SOBS ) I'd give anything... Anything to have things back the way they were. I would. ( SNIFFLES ) ( GASPS ) Angel's god... ( SNIFFLES ) I need to talk to you. ( SNIFFLES ) She would... She would always talk to you Like you were her friend. She told me that she prayed for me. It... It must've worked because I'm still here, right? ( SOBS ) I never prayed for her. Never. And I know that's wrong... on account that she's in real trouble now, And it's all my fault. ( SOBS ) She told me that... That Jesus... ( SNIFFLES ) Jesus went to hell for me... to pay for what I did. ( VOICE BREAKING ) to pay for... To pay for what I did. He must've been tough as shit, because... I can't handle this hell I'm in. I understand that, uh... that you rose yourself from the dead. I get it. I believe it. I do. I believe it. Believe it. So it's not like... It's not like it's a big deal for you to get her out of this coma, right? Right? ( SNIFFLES ) I know... I know that I fucked up. She told me That you forgive everybody. Even shits like me. If you can... If you can do anything, Anything with my life... you can have it. Just, please, Please, Don't let angel die. Don't let her die on me. ( SOBBING ) She's my best friend. I'm so sorry. I love you, baby. I love you. Thank you. All right. That's for the animals. Slow down. You're going too fast. Can I please have all my angels on the steps over here? I forgot what I'm supposed to say. Just remember why you need the room, And you'll say the right thing. Hey, Nicole, Where's that glittery star you made? I mean, I've got a rig And a slot, but no star. Shepherds, pay attention. When watching over your flock at night, Do not... Repeat, do not step on the electrical cords. Okay, here we go. And a five, six, seven, eight. ( PLAYS CHORD ) GIRL: Hey, you didn't say, "and a one, and a two, and a three." All right, I'll give you a one and a two. Kevin, stop picking your nose, buddy. ( PIANO PLAYING ) Who's there? What do you want? Fear not. You're extremely flavored of the lord. What's that mean? God loves you, and he picked you To be the mother of his kid. You know, the son of god. Uh-Uh! I'm a virgin. Uh-Huh. So what do I do? Nothing. God will take care of everything, Including talking to Joseph about it. Okay. If you say so. Hey, Joe, wake up. Mary's with child. Say what? She's pregnant. I didn't do anything. We know, we know. She really is a virgin. What do you want me to do? First, marry her. But don't touch her. Then, name the baby Jesus. Anything else? Yeah, take good care of them. I'll be bringing more instructions later. KEVIN: Caesar was disgusted and sent everyone home to be taxed. My wife's having a baby. Let me it. CHILD: No! You're supposed to say, "there's no room at the inn!" I said "no," didn't I? What do we do? You can sleep in the barn if you want. Thanks. ( PIANO PLAYING ) The star stopped. Look!
