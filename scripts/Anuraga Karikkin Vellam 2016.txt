They will not approve of this marriage. Our religion will be an issue. We didn't have any such issues till yesterday Now from where did all these appear suddenly? Didn't l tell you... when all my friends also think the same.. Shouldn't we realize it then? ''My life...l...l...'' Why are you so selfish? Why don't you think from my side, Abhi? At least listen to my words sometimes. Oh God! Why are you raising your voice? -Public is watching us. -Phone is more important to you than me! -What's that?-Snatching!! Snatching! -lt's okayed. - Yeah! Elle! Wait..Let me talk. Hello brother. Long time no see! Who the hell are you? l am living in that housing colony! Let him go!

Hey, don't go. -You get away!-Listen! l need to go. l promised to take her for the second show l don't go, then she will get angry. That is the biggest problem. Go then! No..don't go. Let me tell you something, Please.. lt's raining! Please come. You still haven't told me anything. l don't know how to tell! Who is Anuradha? She was my lover. We were residing in Adoor. Beside the school, my dad's friend Kurupettan was residing. He was also a Policeman! After playing, we used to assemble and have fun in front of Kurupettan's house. That time, she happily played around there wearing a skirt. Cute girl! But such thoughts were not lingering in my mind those days. l only intended to play football, hang around, have fun and drink Once , l happened to fight with the local people on a temple occasion We never knew that Policemen had come. Then what happened? Sankarettan lost his two teeth. lt triggered a big problem. My dad threw me out of the house During those days, once thrown out of the house, going to Bombay was the fashion! When l was waiting to check the train timings at the station, Her sister and she came running towards me. She said so many things. But l wasn't able to concentrate on anything. My mind was totally on Dharavi While leaving, she hugged me and gave me a kiss. Till now l couldn't understand the reason behind it. Was it for breaking Kurupettan's teeth or...? l realized the seriousness of her love, l approached her home asking for her hand. But they chased me away saying l've no job. ln a fit of anger, l told him that l would marry his daughter only after becoming a Police! That was the period of CV Pappachan (footballer) who turned to policeman. That was my confidence! But, were you a sportsman for that? Let me talk, you idiot! Four years later, l came to understand the seriousness of it. But during that time, she applied for some tests etc for my sake. More than me, she was enthusiastic that l get a job And the rest depends on my ability, right? Later when nothing worked out, l became totally upset And made her also upset. lt was the period when Antony Sir didn't ban arrack! Make it fast. My boat is likely to arrive. When l am sharing my heartrending feelings, you're talking about boat heartlessly! Your wife will wait for you. Where did l stop? Where did l stop, ah? -Antony sir.. - Hmm.. Eventually when realization dawned on me... l wrote the test and got the job And ran aspiring to get her hand... Only to see this scene - There she was at her grandma's tomb, Hugging her husband and sobbing! l was almost dead, buddy. While leaving, she glanced at me with tearful eyes. l still didn't understand the reason behind that. l wish to talk to her. At least once. Once more.. ''Once more where my memories wander...'' ls that way? You go ahead and talk! lf l go late, then my Fabby will not let me in. Who the hell are you? Leave him. l need a decision in this. Good story! Very thrilling to hear. Story!!? lf l delay more, l would miss my boat. Hey, stop, let me finish. What is your problem? l wish to talk to her. l don't have her number with me. Let's go home and abduct hertomorrow. You are talking like a policeman. We shall discuss in the station tomorrow. You idiot! Listen to me. Try to go home. Shucks! Nothing will be at its place! Nobody is responsible here. Why is he shouting? l will be back now. What happened? Where is my old photo album? lt's my School photo! Then, where is my photo? Nothing will be at its place! Where is my old briefcase? lt may be in that. Will you switch off that crap! O my Ellie! lf it's to talk about Abilash, then l will not attend your call. This will be the last. l wish to see him now. Shall l call his home now? Or you do something! l'm not able to tolerate. Please try to sleep! Good night! Elli, are you not coming? Oh God! l'LL COME MUMMY!!! Do you need a fag? Hell with his beard and hair! lt was her! ln that green car. That's Red car, isn't it? Leave that! Did you see? Yeah, but lrfan sir was attending to her. l got a bit late. Don't get tensed. Her address may be found on the register. Note it down. She is really a Charming lady! Look at the smile of a retired lover!! Did you sign this? Raghu, didn't you go to the Control room? l came up to the store. Complaint on walkie-talkie -lsn't Babu there? - Yes, sir. Didn't a lady come now to pay the petty charges for parking offense Yeah! That fair and beautiful lady! Do you know her? No...l stuck the Penalty Charge notice on her car. Too bad, Raghu! We are People-friendly Policemen Firstly, she's a lady whose husband is in the Gulf...Has no one to help her... Aren't we the ones who should help her?. l have taken her number. We can call when needed, right? Okay, sir. Raghu...Salute! Stand away. Got it so soon? lf that rascal tries to contact her, l'll break his legs! You can do that later, come to the matter! He has taken her number and let her go Keep this inside! Keep quiet! Don't shout...come! Hey, l wish to talk to her. Her number is there in his phone. You can surely talk to her, come. lt didn't happen all of a sudden. To marry Anu only, l became a Police! Otherwise, will any human being become a Police? Before Anu's arrival, l'd always wanted to kick and kill the Policemen! Here's lies one! And that me now in Khaki!!! l desperately want to talk to her. Talking to her is a big crime? Not at all. But past is past! Just forget it. As if you! lf you were in my place, won't you take the assistance of Cyber? Do you know what the nickname of my ex-lover is? Spit Rani! When she talks, there'll be a spit shower! When you talk, nectar showers, is it? -Come again! - Nothing. As you know, Anuradha is in a rich set up now. And you, same old low class! You always talk unfair! What you told is only unfair! You want to talk to Anuradha, right? We'll find a way, come. Enough? Where is your son? Don't ever ask me about him. Takes away my life! Tracing out the address and finding her is filthy Why don't we ask lrfan? lf it was somebody else, it would've worked out. But not with him! You eat! You only need her number, right? Without lrfan sir's knowledge. Not only lrfan...Nobody should know this. And the number has to be deleted from his phone! We'll find a way. Why don't we seek Mahesh's help? That lrfan's tail! lmpossible! l've grabbed his collar once. This is your problem. Do something buddy. Wait.. Hey, move your leg. Some of my important data... few photos are in it... lf you try, you can bring her out! Will you please try? Will you stop this? Okay, sir. Will this work? How Selfish is she! Neither responds nor calls back! Besides, my phone is also switched off. Shucks! -Shall l take it off?. - What? Engine! lf this boy is going to repair, then l will take away my bike. Boss my.. l already warned you...Be careful That your underpants are not taken off. You also joined for that lnstead of being sentimental here, go there and show your emotions lt might work! No need of sentiment! l just need my phone back. -You only need your phone back? - Yes. Can't you ask then? You think it's a comedy! You are solely responsible for this plight of mine. -Me? - Yes! -Where would she be found now? - What for? Where can we find her now? Let's search. What are you guys planning to do? Let's go and try. Come! Sit.. Where are you going? Will check the mileage and be back. -Let me see your helmet .- He will be back, buddy. Stinking so bad!! Let me see your helmet.

Became a bike thief, Chain snatcher etc. And now your dad has entrusted me anotherjob also. Actually, what happened? Didn't he tell you anything? Go and get me a Biryani! Boss, my bike? Ask his dad. His dad took it away. - l want to go home now. - Get away, you lad! See how badly l'm hurt! How will l go home with this now? Stealing C.l's phone is quite risky. Will get more thrashings. Why are you crying forthat? l'm not crying. Water is rolling down from my eyes. That's what l asked - why are you crying? l don't understand one thing. Can't he himself ask him? Yeah, even l felt the same. Being a colleague, he can ask himself. Don't think l am complaining because he is your dad. Even if l talk or not talk, he'll thrash to the core!

Come, dude! -Oh my God my beer! - Come. Dude, l shall wait here. You go and bring her. Suppose someone notices us... you go and bring her. -l like Vanilla. - Then, you don't like Chocobar? Come here. Don't laugh too much and mess up the makeup. Appears good, isn't it? Where are the diamond bangles? Haven't you worn? Why did you run away when l called you? l didn't run...l only walked! The other day also you ran away on seeing me. No, sir. You come to steal, right? Who are you? -l came along with him..- ls it? Police!! Take both of them to the station. Don't send them until l come. What for? What is our crime? Get into the jeep...l say. -What is our crime? - Get into the jeep l say. -Take off your hands. - Get into the jeep. Sir, bathroom.. Me also, dude! Let me ask. Why didn't he say earlier itself that he's your son? l'll come and meet C.l sir later. Shall l take him? Okay, sir. Sir, please leave him also. Can't send him until C.l sir comes. You go. How mean he is! Dad! Drinking and creating a ruckus in a girl's house? You dog! -Go home, have food and come! - Shut up! Bathroom.. l never did any wrong, dad! She loved me deeply. l too. But l ...without minding her... l've hurt her a lot, dad. l want to say sorry to her. Just once... Only for once. But today is her wedding. lf l don't tell it today.. Then, l will also become like you, dad. Then, why didn't you tell this earlier?. Mom also asked this. Don't waste time, let's move. -Raghu sir, where are you going? -For a wedding. Shall l ride? lf we go like this, we won't reach there! l know what to do. Haven't l brought you till here! Saree suits you pretty well, dear! Only l know how uncomfortable l feel. Wedding over! l told you, dad, that l will ride. Now see, the wedding is over. l came to know the happenings only after l returned from the Airport. Had l been here, no such thing would have happened! Your father? l'm Elizabeth's daddy, Prakash Kopara! They have gone to the Cemetry. You can meet her there. Okay. All of you can get into the Vehicle. -Shouldn't they come? - You get in. They will come. The right place! To realize how important you are in my life... See...it became so late! l hurt you for no reasons, Eli! And also annoyed you needlessly! but...l didn't understand your value, then, Eli! My life, without you, is incomplete... Stop it, Abi please! People are watching. Let them talk. When my parents were happy because of you, l wished that l also get the same happiness in my life. When l heard your voice last night... That's why l came running over there, Eli, just to see you. Eli...it's me, right? This is my nature, isn't it? Don't you know me.. l will not be able to understand whatever you say, Abi. Moreover, this is not the right time to express it. At least when you'd come home last night, couldn't you have told me? Now my marriage is over, Abi! What am l to do now? Yeah, Suma! l gave him an idea. Hope it will work if he does it perfectly. l know you are helpless. l'm not sure whether you'll be present in my life hereafter. But l'll miss you. Miss your calls... ...l'll miss the way you irritate me! Eli, l love you. lt might work out! Sorry! Plan failed! Will call you later! Shall l go? Then, Abi, as l couldn't reach Suma aunty over phone, yesterday, l called you. lt was to invite Suma aunty and Anu for my marriage and nothing else. Shall l go? Let's go.. Let's go, yeah. -Okay, one minute, please. - Okay. Wait, l will be back now. Thanks. Shall we go? Hmm! You ride the bike -Here goes Anuradha! - Eh! Where? ln that car! Where are you going? My love didn't work out. - Let's go behind this. - ls it? Then, come. -Are you sure, dad? - Certainly. Hello! Horn!! Can't you see, the glass is shut! Oh God! Where did she disappear? -You move, l'll ride - Shucks! Dash up, son. -Hello..can you stop for a second, please? - Stop..Stop. Stop. Dad..go.. No..Not me..You go. Madam. One minute. Anuradha? Sorry, you are mistaken l guess. Oh, sorry! -Who is that? - l don't know. No chance! How many years of love? -.She had a mole over here. - l see!! Let's go, dad!
