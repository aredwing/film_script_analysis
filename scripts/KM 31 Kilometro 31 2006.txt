What's your name? Catalina, don't even think about moving the car. - A mechanic should see it first. - Really? With all the things I have to do. By the way, it's almost midnight. You sister should be here. What is it? What's the matter? Breathe! Where are you going? Catalina! Agata! No! My sister! - Let me go! - Catalina! Let me go! She got hit... Look at her! She's arresting. No... No, Agata, don't! Don't, Agata! Please, don't! Let go of me! Emergency room! You can't go in! You can't go in! - Vital signs? - Breathing in 12. - Done. - Pulse in 60. Impossible, we have to amputate. Saw. Are you Miss Hameran's relatives? I'm her sister, doctor. Catalina. I'm Dr. Morales. - Would you like to sit down? - No. - How's my sister? - She's stable. Thank God she's out of danger. Unfortunately we had to amputate both legs to save her. I'm sorry. There's something else. Your sister has gone into a coma. She's not reacting to anything. May I see her? Of course, ma'am. But... your sister's face is very swollen, and her body... Well, I just want you to be prepared. I'm sorry, sir. Only next of kin. Sis... Help me. Help me. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? You have to rest. And the kid? What kid? The one my sister hit with her car. We didn't get any children tonight. I suggest you go home. We'll let you know if anything changes. Here. They're sleeping pills. Never leave me. Never forhet me. Always wait for me. Forgive me, dauhhter. I didn't know what I was doing. I never thouhht you could, never. Don't cry, I'm okay. I'm here. How's she doing? Badly. Any news? No. We just have to wait. - I want to see her. - They won't let you. I'll stay. I'll call you if anything happens. I have to see her. I called the office, told them I won't be in for a few days. You can stay at my house if you want. I mean, it's closer. So you won't have to take the highway. Thanks. It'll be all right. Your sister will come out of it. I'm gonna stay at Omar's for a few days. It's closer. Yes. I heard that. Thanks. See you here. Omar, I want you to know I'm here for you, okay? Agata's always been very nice to me and... well, you know. Thanks, Nuo. Catalina has been very important to me ever since I got to Mexico. - Ever since college. - Yes. Agata told me. She's a good friend. I care for her. I can see that. It's obvious you do. Have you told her that? That I care for her? I show her. I did tell her. What the fuck are you talking about? One day I argued with Agata... ...so I went to her house to apologize and... ...I confused them. What do you want? They're identical. Wrong. They're very different. I want to take a look at the highway. Will you get her things? Okay. I'll wait for you here. DRY FIREWOOD FOR SALE ENTRYWAY TO "EL ENCANTO" Hello? Hey, you! What are you doing there? You didn't hear me? I'm talking to you! Son of a bitch... Coming! Lose anything? No. My girlfriend had an accident here last night. I was looking around, seeing if there was anything here. - You sure? - About what? Are you sure you weren't looking for anyone? How do you know? Don't look. It was an accident. I'm in charge of the investigation. You're investigating? You could call it that. You could call it that? Don't go looking for trouble. Don't investigate on your own. Trouble? - Trouble, why? - Do you need a ride? I just heard someone scurrying over there. - Just now? - Yeah. What's your name? - Omar. - Look, Omar. Better focus on helping your girlfriend. I heard something, I tell you. - No. - Why? See, let me explain. - Don't. - Let me finish. You know what? Give me your name and badge number. Martin Ugalde, 02034. - Martin who? - Listen... ...for your own good, don't come back here. Is that a threat? Action! Ahata and Catalina's birthday. June 2004. Here's sister number 1. She's beautiful. Thanks honey. Here... there's sister number 2. Look... they're identical. They're identical. She's talkinh to her Spaniard friend. Very funny. After a few hours we're still at the party... ...and people are drinking as you can see. The sisters are drinking as well. And fightinh. As usual. They fight. Mom! Sister! Sister! Help me! Help me! You left the door... Sorry, sorry. I thought you'd seen me. Where were you? What are those? Pills. Why? Youre not feeling well? No. - Why? - What do you want me to say? Nothing. Take it easy. I haven't said anything. Here. I brought your things... ...and I got you something to eat. I'm off. Nuo... ...thanks. I know you're trying to help, but... ...I have to figure this out on my own. Yeah. I get it. I understand you, but you're not on your own. All right? The doctor said we should speak to you. That it might do you good. The truth, I have so many things to tell you. I dreamed of mother. She and dad... ...got along better with you. We're alike, but... ...you're better at everything. They like you better. And I hate to acknowledge it, but... ...it made me angry to see you happy. It made me angry that dad trusted you more. But I love you. I love you more than I love myself. Agata! Agata! Agata, can you hear me? Agata, it's me, Catalina! Somebody help me, please. My sister woke up. Calm down, ma'am. Nurses, the equipment. She twitched one finger and opened her eyes. Sorry I didn't warn you before... ...but these things are normal in comatose patients. The nervous system sends electrical discharges. No. She looked at me. Please believe me, ma'am. We haven't registered any readings. Machines don't lie. - How're you? - How is Agata? The same? They stopped the bleeding. She's still in a coma. We must be patient. Wait a few days. Nuo, can you take me to the highway after lunch? Yeah, sure. Your house? No, where the accident happened. What for? Agata hit a kid with the car. Where is he? There's no such kid, Catalina. And there's nothing there. I need to go. I need to go there. I can't explain it. Go eat something. I'll catch up with you, and we'll go. Omar... ...aren't you getting confused again? Why are you telling me this? You know. Are you serious? You all right? - What is it? - Nothing. You know? It's incredible that after such a long time... ...I know nothing about you. - What do you mean? - I know some things, but... ...when I ask you about yourself... ...important things... ...you shut me out. Like, for instance, about your parents, I don't know what happened. - I have no family. - Yes, you always say that. Why don't you just let it go? Because I don't like to talk about that, Nuo. I don't get you. No matter how hard I try, I don't. I'm done. I cant take it anymore. My dad died in an accident. An accident... on hisjob. In a construction site. And my mom... She was sick. She was a schizophrenic. She never remembered the pills she had to take... ...and dad always told Agata to remind her. He always trusted her more. I don't know why. I got jealous. I gave mom the bottle of pills. It was my fault she took too many pills. She drowned. Me and Agata got her out. We tried to revive her. We were seven! Sorry, I didn't know. I'm all right. Don't tell Omar. Omar, wouldn't you rather let Nuo drive? You haven't slept. What's the matter with you two? - Nothing. - Nothing. We're close. I know. Around Km 30, ease off a bit. I said I know. I speak the same language. It's just a suggestion, Nuo. Suggestion. Go to hell. - Why are you doing that? - Lighten up, man, okay? Don't talk to me like that. Don't start with your bullshit, like back there. What are you talking about? What is it with you two? Sorry, this fog makes me nervous. Little Spaniard gets nervous. What? I said, little Spaniard gets nervous. I heard you. Settle down, all right? Nuo, watch out! Hello? Yes, ma'am, it's an emergency. A dead person in the Desierto de los Leones. Yes. Who? What? Hello? Hello? Yes. Omar... Omar Cantu. Who's there? Who's there? - I'm okay. - What's the matter with you? I'm talking to you. What's the matter? I saw the kid, Omar. He's there, I swear. - Nuo. - Hey. I'll go. It's okay. You'll be free by the morning. It's not my fault. Nuo, calm down. Calm down, you're not under arrest. I'll be right over. We'll straighten out this mess downtown. - Yes, but take your hands off me. - Calm down, Nuo! Come with me. You'll be tested there. Are you going to tell me what happened? I heard... a woman on the street. Last night, too. I thought she was Agata. Then she was screaming and crying in a manhole. Inside the sewer system. - What are those pills for? - Why do you want to know? They're doing something to you. No, it's the other way around. - Are they prescription? - Who cares? I won't take them anymore if it makes you happy. I'd be happy if you didn't go back to that house and that highway. Sorry. I need to talk to you. What about? What's wrong with you? It's that... ...I can't get it out of my head. Her voice asking for help. When she called, I heard it all. The sound of the horn... ...the screeching tires, the impact... We argued that night. It was probably... It wasn't your fault. I told her I wasn't sure about loving her. I felt she was putting pressure on me. Remember when I started dating her? I went to your house, apologized to you... ...I begged for ten minutes. And you... didn't say a word. You just played along. I could never tell her the same things I told you. I could never tell her that I love her. That I need her, that I do love her. She knows, Omar. She knows. I'm sure because I also know. And you'll tell her so when she wakes up. You're identical. Sometimes... I'd like to imagine you're her. Nuo was right. We can get confused. Look. Nuo and I don't get along. But that guy has a great heart. And he loves you. Garcia Castro, Maria Concepcion. She had ID on her. Here's the forensic report and I spoke to the doctor. She's been dead for about 23 hours. She died almost one day ago. The guy didn't kill her. He went by there six or seven hours ago. He hit a dead woman. Poor boy. He was worried sick. Let the "poor boy" go then. Did you denounce me? I knew it. What are you doing here? "An accident on Km 31 of the Desierto de los Leones highway. " Again? Didn't I tell you to stay away from there? How's your friend? Still in a coma. Oh, man! - Remember what I told you up there? - Yeah. We're looking for that kid. I've been looking for him for three years. There have been accidents. Mostly, with young women. They call in scared, badly hurt... Sometimes they're reported dead. They try to keep it under tabs. They call us inept... you know. That's why I keep a low profile on this. Well, that... ...and because it's hard to believe. Why are there so many accidents up there? Do you believe in ghosts? Ghosts? That is absurd. I can only offer you proof. You draw your own conclusions. You wanna know or not? Sign here, please. I need a... pen. Here you go. - Catalina? - Nuo, how are you? Better. They're about to release me. It appears that I didn't kill her. She'd been dead for many hours. But she was on her feet. We saw her! Yes, I know. I can't get it out of my mind either. I have to find out what's hoing on there. What do you want to do? Let's go to that place. The kid could live over there. Catalina, I don't think we should go... Make somethinh up, het Omar to lend you his car... ...but don't tell him where we're hoing. Catalina, do you remember the sign? Which one? Back there. - The dry firewood one? - Yeah. You think "El Encanto" could be a village? Don't know. Why? Because it's that way. Let's go. What now? Do we knock? Come in, child. I was expecting you. Who is it? Omar. Omar Cantu. Hello. Come in. How're you, officer? Martin. Or Ugalde, have it your way. Ugalde. My beloved pets. You like fish? You're right. Let's cut to the chase. Come in. You've met my pets. Now I'll introduce you to my obsession SUPER CRASH MORE WOMEN IN CRASHES PHANTOM GIRL Coffee? Why did you say you were waiting for me? I know who you are. I know you have many questions. I also know why you came here. Your answers are in a tragedy that happened long ago. It has to do with you and your sister. My sister? I already told you: Your being here is not a coincidence. Those are the only cases I could salvage prior to 2001. But when I began investigating... ...twenty-five cases. But... you spoke of a tragedy. This happened many, many years ago. During the colonization, in a village close to Mexico City. In that village lived a very beautiful young woman. ...a Spaniard soldier deceived her... ...by using her to have the children his wife couldn't give him. When she realised, she became crazy... ...and threw herself and her baby to the river... ...along with her, to die. Since then, the souls of the women and the children... ...are condemned to deambulate around rivers. Mostly, the children encounter young women. The mother's hrief is heard like a howl... ...crying out for her dead children. Some live to tell. Others don't. If this were true, there'd be... There'd be ghosts all over the place. Perhaps not all over the place, but... ...take a look at this. I heard that woman. - Where? - On Rio Mixcoac Ave. Screaming, grieving just like you said. Did you see the baby as well? Do you have anything else on the woman on Mixcoac? Yes, plenty of cases. "February 19, 1999, Rio Mixcoac Avenue. "Agroup of high school kids reported hearing a woman trapped in a manhole. " Why are you so interested on Rio Mixcoac Ave.? I live close by. My sister- in-law said she heard a woman around there. I didn't know what she was talking about, but... Now you believe me, right? I've got a map around here. Look. Your sister is burdened with someone else's pain... ...and nobody can help her with that. Not praying, nor sacrifices. Nothing. Although... ...perhaps your sister can help. - How? She's trapped between two worlds. But you have a bond with your sister. That is why you can see the other world... ...and you can bring it to you and to the people around you. What worlds? The world of the living... ...and that of the dead. Sorry, but... ...that I know of, the existence of ghosts hasn't been proved. But there are people who claim having seen them. D'you think they lie? No. Not necessarily. A noble, sensitive spirit can hear and see a grieving soul. But be careful. There are spirits who can transform themselves or what you see. They can help you... ...but they can also deceive you, like any living person. It's dark and I don't want you running any unecessary risks. Catalina, you can stay in the room. Nuo, you can make yourself comfortable by fireplace. We're not staying, are we? I trust her. The bedtime story was fine, but... ...do you actually believe all this? I heard that woman, Nuo. - Catalina... - Nuo, it's true. Agata is trapped in that place. I can feel it. She tells me so. I dream about it. Catalina? Catalina! Impossible. Impossible. Catalina, this is Omar. Please call me back. It's urgent. I've met this person... you're right. We have to find that woman... ...in the sewer of Rio Mixcoac. There's an entrance by my house. Call me back. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. Catalina! Nuo! Hey! It's dangerous out here. Here. I'll get back on my own. Catalina! Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... Mystic rose, pray for them. Tower of David, pray for them. Ivory tower, pray for them. House of gold, pray for them Ark of the Covenant, pray for them. Gates of heaven, pray for them. Nuo. What? It's day. You haven't slept, have you? I'll sleep later. Good morning, children. I'll make coffee. Thanks, but we'll be on our way. It's no bother. I'm always on my own. - Here, you dropped it. - Thanks. I didn't hear you go out. You were awake all night, weren't yout? You're right not to want to sleep. When you sleep, you're sensitive, you're open. Maybe it'll help you get closer to your sister. Ask her for advice. Sleep. She'll guide us. You'll probably have to go back and face that woman. With her spirit. Look beyond what your eyes can see. Forgive me, ma'am, but what are you talking about? I will only ask you to be strong. Help us, even when you don't understand. Take care. Fight. Defend yourself. What are you doing? Seeing some things Omar left. - Where did he get all this? - Don't know. But I think I'm beginning to understand. Need any help? Weren't you going to see your sister? Nuo... ...thanks for everything. I've been thinking about things and... ...and I thought about all these years... ...and... ...I don't know... - No. - Let me tell you. Catalina. Not now. It's not a good moment. You're... ...under a lot of pressure. It's not a good moment. All right. Look. Look at this old map. The old lady said all this happened during the colony. I compared it to a modern map. Come here. The city was very small. The size of the central square. Here is the old village of Coyoacan. Presently, the neighborhood of Coyoacan. You know that. There was a river here. Look at the modern map. It's right underneath this avenue: Mixcoac. Of course! The Mixcoac River! The same river that crosses the Desierto de los Leones. It goes over all the same points. Maybe the old lady was right when she said that about... ...looking beyond the eyes... OLD WOMAN ENDS HER LIFE I don't know. What is it? See something? No, no. I'll go see my sister. Shall I go with you? Catalina! Omar? Omar, what happened to you? What's wrong with you? You're scaring me! Answer me, please! Omar. What is it? What's the matter with you? Answer me! Where are we going? Omar. Omar, damn it, answer me! Where are we going? Omar, what are we doing here? Hello? I'm calling to report a... ...dead person. Km 31, on the Desierto de los Leones highway. No, I won't leave my name. Message received today. Catalina, this is Omar. Please call me back. It's urgent. I've met a person who... You're right... we have to find that woman. At the Rio Mixcoac sewer. There's an entrance by my house. I'm going to the road to look for you. Call me back please. They won't beat me. You won't beat me, you won't beat me. I can't! I can't do it anymore. I can't. I can't do it anymore. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in my mind. Agata is with me. I'll help her. She needs me. We're not different. We're the same. We're one. Horrifyingly identical. In my mind... I'm not. Shit! Taxi! To the Desierto de los Leones highway. Affirmative. Km 31, Desierto de los Leones highway. What happened? He was hit by a car last night. Last night? Where did they find him? There, on the side of the road. In the bushes. Wasn't there a woman here? Awoman? No. Please, get back. Excuse me, officer, what's the name of the deceased? Omar Cantu. Excuse me! You knew Omar? Yes, I knew him. Who are you? I'm... Well, we were friends. Yes, we met downtown. I'm Martin Ugalde. I saw Omar yesterday, gave him some files. Files? Yes, I saw them too. There's something very weird. The river still exists. Like the old lady said... What are you talking about? Which old lady? An old lady that lives close by, in an old house. - Show me. - I can't. I must find my friend. One thing at a time. It can't be. It's here, right? An old lady used to live here... ...but she commited suicide on the highway. It happened in the forties. She told Catalina to look here. Help me find her, please. Catalina is sure she can communicate with her sister. They've done it forever. The old lady said she's asking for help or somethinh. Do you know exactly where in Mixcoac? Yeah, well... more or less. Omar gave us a map. It's near his place. Of course, I made those marks. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Why did you do this to me? - I'm not crazy... - Mom's here. Take it easy. - Easy. - Why did you do this? Honey don't. Must be around here. Look! The car. There she is. Don't move. Ma'am! Officer! Catalina! Hello, child. We're here. I came to help, my child. It's the only way to put an end to this. To help your sister. Are you ready to sacrifice yourself for her? I already tried. I sacrificed myself for them... ...but it didn't do any good. Because the children didn't die where the highway is now. The river dragged them there... ...but they died here. The sacrifice should've been made here. Now I know it... thanks to you. And your sister. Who are you? Let Agata go. I know where you are, but leave my sister alone. Don't leave me here, darling. Don't be afraid. I've been expecting you. Forgive me, mother! There's nothing to forgive. Come, child. Come with us. Calm down. Don't fear. Calm down. My dear... ...it will be over soon. Catalina! Catalina! Catalina! It's me, Nuo! I won't leave you. Never, never. There, there. What is it? Where are we? In the sewer. What is it? What's wrong? My love, why are you staring at me? - Who are you? - It's me, Catalina. You're not Catalina! Catalina? Drop the gun! Drop it! Now! Nuo, what's wrong? You have to do it. Nuo! It's the only way. You must end this. Nuo, drop the gun! I'm Catalina. Everythinh I loved was over... And then... life itself. What happened? Hey. Hey. Hey! Where am I? Take it easy. You're in the hospital. What happened? Where is Catalina? I'm glad you're here, doctor. She woke up this morning very upset. I gave her 15 mg of Diazepam during the night. - She calmed down? - Yes. Where is Catalina? Catalina is dead. You killed her. Don't you remember? What are you talking about? It can't be. What did you see? Who was it? I must see her! What is this? It's for your own safety until you recover. You're gonna need help! I have to see Catalina. Untie me. Untie me, I said! Where is Catalina? Untie me! Thank you. Agata. Miss Hameran. Hello, Agata. Where am I? In a hospital. Don't make any effort. Your memory will return gradually. Where is he? Where is my child? - What child? - My child. My child! You don't have any children. Where is my child? Don't get upset, please. Don't get... Where is my child? Where is he? Nurse! - Stay calm, please. - Where is my child? Where is my child?
