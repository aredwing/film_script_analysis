There's a huge pillar behind her. And the number is... What's the number? I don't know. She looks like... she's waiting for someone. Full of sadness. Can you see it? No. Every time I hear this song, I see her. It's so realistic I wonder if I've seen her before in real life. The girl of your dreams. Good song, right? Bittersweet. I'm not feeling it. Reminds me of my college sweetheart. We listened to it together. Let's go. It's time. Okay. Why are you taking it? You don't even have a record player. It's never been played. I'd appreciate it more. - There's a smudge there. - No... That was there already. Are you sure? See? It was there already. Kids, wake up. Hurry up and eat. I wanna use a fork. Kong, how much time do we have? Lek... Four hours. We should leave by two to be safe. This smells nice. Lek. This smells better. Kong. Naughty girl. Lek. Wanna watch a movie? Okay. Lek. Which one would you do? Neither. Really? Not my type. I'd do both of them. Do you have Gossip Star? Hey. Hey! Where's Piek? He quit. I'm his replacement. My name's Kong. Good book? Yeah. Do you like to read? No. What's the book? Bourne. James Bond? No, the other Bourne. The spy who lost his memory. Sounds familiar. Does that actually happen? Maybe he doesn't want to remember. How does it end? Cliched. He remembers and then finds his way home. You're a real bookworm huh? I wanted to be a writer. But I don't have enough experience. - You need experience? - Of course. If I wanted to write about a spy, I'd have to know what it was like to be a spy. What did you do before? I worked on movie sets. Did the continuity. What? Continuity... Making sure that everything looks the same from shot to shot. Why did you quit? Making movies is cooler than writing. Not cool. Movies aren't original. Even this one has a movie copy. Hello. You're locked out? What type of lock do you have? I can pick any lock. But I'm not available right now, I'm at the shop. Don't worry. No scratch. Like I was never there. Kong... Kong... You haven't showered? You'll be late. Bye, mom. Lek. What's the matter? I couldn't find my shirt. Which one? The red one. It's my favorite. Happens all the time. When you stop looking, that's when you'll find it. I only have a few shirts. My flat is tiny. Or maybe someone is sneaking into my place? Who would sneak into your place? Right? You didn't eat breakfast? I'm bored of eating at home. Eating at someone else's place is better? - Lek. - Huh? - Do you like teriyaki chicken. - What? - Teriyaki chicken. - What's that? Chicken with soy sauce. Whatever. Just buy the one with no smell. Don't leave any trace. I'm going to buy gloves. Who are you spying on? Nobody. Then why are you standing here? My ex-girlfriend. - Really? - Yeah. Is she pretty? What's her name? Nook. Why don't you go and say hello? Better not. Why? I dumped her in college. She was hurt. Tried to kill herself. How is she now? I don't know. But she looked okay. No worries then. Let's go. Kong. Why the sad face? Haven't you ever had a girlfriend? Never? Lek... You've never had a girlfriend? Never. I'm no good with girls. Are you gay? It's just... It's easy. You just start chatting. I have nothing to chat about. Chat about anything. This, that, daily life. There's nothing good about my life. Really? Nothing good at all? Nope. Not one good memory? Right now is the best time in my life. I'll show you how it's done. You think that's funny? What the hell? So many rooms to choose. Why this one? Sorry, my bad. Look, just like a spy movie. Let's go then. Are you testing me? Do you give up? There's always a way. Cool! Wow! How did you do that? Don't test me. Forgot to see how you did it. Why? Just curious. I can show you anytime. Do you have a thin card? I think so. - Insurance card okay? - Let me see. It's like a department store. He's a fag. Stop calling me. Delete my old photos and stop tagging me. But I miss you. That's enough. Our relationship is impossible. Nothing's impossible as long as we love each other: -) I don't love you. I'm married. I don't care. Our story ended at Phu Toey. I hate that woman. I'm going to tell everyone about us! You're crazy. If you won't accept me, I'll never leave you in peace. What's wrong with you? Leave me alone. Don't you love me anymore? I hate you. But I love you. ... Loveloveloveloveuuuuuuuu I'm going to kill you. What did you do? Nothing. Do you remember me? He won't even know it's missing. Good boy. Ek, why are you talking to me like this? Wait a second. Can you listen to me? I haven't done anything! Don't talk to me like this Please calm down. I don't know what you're talking about. My computer is normal. You said he would be back at five? I don't know. Ek! Lek. Kong, you're awake. Does it hurt? Yes. Okay, let me see. Breathe in. Again. Breathe out. You have some minor cuts. Nothing to worry about. How about this scar? - Knife... when I was a kid. - Knife? Looks more like a sword. Lucky that someone found you. Or a tiger might have carried you off. What were you doing up in the forest anyway? Oy! Oy! Stop that! That's Oy. She's always sniffing things and caught a lung infection. Been here almost a year. The doctors are at a loss. Tong. Tong. It's you isn't it? No. Don't you remember me? You're mistaken. It's not you? They're putting up a new building. The old one had too many dead people. The patients were afraid. They said there was a ghost on the fourth floor. You saw the ghost? No, I didn't. Will they go away now? Will they not remember anything anymore? I suppose so. So the ghosts are in the concrete? I always thought they were floating in the air. Why do you like to sniff? They smell good. They do? All these old containers leave a scent. Have a sniff. Nice, right? You can almost smell powder... bills... It takes you back in time. I really enjoy it. Once, I found a canister for this old movie, Charming Bangkok. It was huge! I sniffed it for months! I'm Oy. What's your name? Lek. Liar. You smell like Eternity. I like it. The Eternity Hotel in Petchburi. Smells like cigarettes. It's the first scent I remember. My dad took me there when I was seven. At first, I was so happy. The room was big. And brand new. I thought it was made for me. I jumped all over the bed. But suddenly, I noticed something. Someone had been there. They had left a scent. I started to cry. And said to my father... This room... already has an owner. It's not mine. You know... it takes 6 seconds for peacocks to mate. Their happiness is so short. Have you heard the fairytale about the golden peacock? Who the hell are you? Shit! Lek. Is he dead? Let's go. Hurry up, let's go. Remember, we were never here. Come on! What are you doing? - I'm scared. - Standing there's not going to help. Come on. Stop shivering! It's annoying! Ek. Don't leave me alone. What's wrong with you? I'm freezing. Ek! Tana!! Ek! Where are you? Ek! Tana, can you hear me? Tana! Where the hell are you? Make yourself at home. - Can I put my bag here? - Go ahead. You bought it so cheap? Yeah, and fully furnished too. It's beautiful. - How do you like the sofa? - It's nice. - I think the color's weird. - Not at all. What did you get? Many things. It's dusty though. I haven't cleaned yet. Unbelievable. Have you heard the fairytale about the golden peacock? In the land of Palanzi... There were two peacocks that lived in the forest. One day... there was a forest fire. The peacocks... promised they would never leave each other. They would perish together with their baby. But when the fire neared, the male peacock couldn't take the heat. He flew away alone... ...leaving his mate and baby to die. But... because of the promise he made, The male peacock didn't get very far. He was soon shot down by a hunter. The peacock was reborn... ...as a wicked bandit feared by all. One day, the bandit saw the young Prince... ...placing his soul inside a casket. So the bandit stole the casket and destroyed the Prince's body. He traded his soul for that of the prince. Later, the bandit met the lady Pimpa. He fell in love with her at first sight. But Pimpa left the bandit to ponder. He was so sad that he slashed his wrist. But still, he couldn't die... ...because his soul belonged to another. The hermit found the bandit's body, drained completely of blood. He taught the bandit... ...to always return to your true self. But the bandit said... My soul is lost. How can I return? Your name is Kongkiat? Yes. Last name spelled like your insurance card? Yes. Age? Forty. Home? Bangkok. Single? Yes. Live with family? With my mother. Mother or mother of your child? Profession? I work on movie sets. Really? So you meet movie stars! Yeah. Are you the director? No. I'm Continuity. Pardon? Continuity. Continue? What's that? I make sure that... ...everything is the same from shot to shot. What were you doing in the forest? I was taking location photos. But I fell on the way back. Where's your camera? Probably fell down the cliff. Beautiful? Huh? The view from the cliff. Yes, it was. What's the movie? You need to write that down? So I can go see it when it's in the cinema. "Lek The Spy" Strange title. Well, you're lucky. Many people have died there. LEK THE SPY The man wakes without any memory of what happened. He finds that his head is being pushed underwater. Someone is trying to drown him. His natural instincts take over. He punches in the seven digit code on his handcuffs. The cuffs fall away easily. He carries his weak body back home. The unlocked door sets alarm bells ringing In his head. Evidence suggests he's not alone. The lipstick stain on the glass must belong to his lover. Jeong Min Ah. Where is she now? The Debussy Sonata they played together echoes in his head. At that moment, attackers strike from all directions. But our hero discovers that he is able to defend himself with ease. Where did he learn these martial arts moves? Then, our hero makes a mistake and an attacker cuts him with a sword. But strangely, the sword cannot hurt him. Is he protected by a mystical charm? Maybe it's the power of his tattoos. Our hero presses the hot iron against his attacker's face until his death screams are finally extinguished. Our hero stands amid the carnage still unsure of who he Is or what has happened to him. He only knows one fact: This place is dangerous and he must escape! Only one name echoes in his mind. Until the truth reveals itself, only this one name will remain. He will call himself... 'LEK THE SPY' Nook. What? What was the song you played yesterday? Which song? We listened to so many. The song with a lot of piano. The one we kept repeating? Yes. You like it? It's so depressing. It's really nice. Don't you like it? No. I used to play it during piano lessons. Can you burn me a copy? Okay, later. Which track? Eight. 'Ballade' What does it mean? I don't know. Maybe it means Dream Girl. How do you know? Last night, I dreamt of a girl, and this song was playing. Was it me? Nope. Don't be mad. It's only a dream. Then go listen to it yourself. Later. Will your neighbors hear us? Nobody's home in the afternoon. Really? Sure? You can pick any lock? Yeah. Any at all? Put it this way, as long as it's not an eyeball scanner like in the movies, they're all the same. The keycard locks are the hardest. So you're not that good. So what's your technique? Very simple. Just make an exact copy of the real one. Where did you learn all this stuff? Why are you asking? Just curious. Hey. I've got a plan. I'm listening. Amazing! Keep your voice down. Take it easy. You sure nobody's here? I've checked already. Do we take our shoes off? I suppose so. When you feel an emptiness in life, someone's just left it. That's deep. What do we do now? Nothing. We're just borrowing their home for a little while. I feel like a thief. We're not taking anything. Just want to know about other people's lives. That's all. What do you want to know? The way they live, what they eat, how they think. I still feel weird. First time is always weird. You'll get used to it. Check it out. Lek. These are the rules... One, we don't tell anyone. It's our secret. Two, we're only here to borrow. We don't take anything. We choose buildings that have no cameras. As long as we don't take anything, the owner isn't troubled. So we're not troubled. What about this wine? Shit. Won't they miss their tissues? No. Who counts tissues? Next time, we should bring our own towels and trash bag. There's going to be a next time? Lek There's a piano. Do you play? Do I look like I play piano? Hey, someone might hear you! The whole floor's empty. I'll teach you. Come. Sit down. Try it. See... if we didn't come here today, would you ever learn the piano? Maybe we should bring gloves next time. You'll get the hang of it. Lek. 'CHARMING BANGKOK' 'CHARMING BANGKOK' You're blocking my way. Go that way. Which way I go is my business. Then out of my way. If you were a man, I'd wallop you. Well, if you were a woman, I'd slap you too. Go... you buffalo... Down... down... Sbai, this is crazy... Don't stop me... I'm leaving. Make sure to rip the lizard's tail! Mother. Beat him, as Father taught you. Then you can marry Sbai. Areal cheerleader. Our son won! Prae has returned! He's back! Did you know... peacocks only take 6 seconds to mate? That's funny. Don't you find that sad? I've seen a live one before. At the zoo? Is it real? It likes potato chips too. Really? Are you waiting for someone? Not anymore. You're going home? It's been a long time right? Yes, a long time. What's your name? Nook. What's yours?
