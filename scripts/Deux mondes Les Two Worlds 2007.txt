A savior will come from the second world. Read the other side of the Maleedja. He will Fight the tyrant. He will come from the sky and leave by land. He will save us because he is... the greatest magician of all worlds. Queen of spades, queen of clubs, right I put the cards back in the deck. Wait while I shuffle. Blow on them. What strength! Another shuffle. A rat! What's in here? Queen of hearts! And queen of clubs! How did you do it? Magicians never tell! The bath is ready, kids. I don't want a bath! I smell stinky feet! Go wash up! I'll do more magic later. I don't want a bath. - What's wrong, honey? - I don't know. It was like... Hurt yourself? Move it, kids! You read the Maleedja all wrong! I read it correctly. You don't respect tradition. Nonsense! The Zotarians will kill him. I have to return to Barcelona. Again? It's for poor countries. Meetings with NGOs. To redistribute our products in developing countries. - lt'll... - I know. They ask a lot of you. You hate me moving up. Not at all. It's just that... we prefer you being around. - Come with me then. - No way. Why not I don't feel like moving. I don't know why I still ask. Come on! She's full. This is valuable in poor countries! Look at Mommy. She's upset. When do the new moons arrive? In eXactly twelve lizards. He will appear atop this tree. Maybe if we boil Qrums... Where are you, Savior? What's wrong? Did you see? It happened again! - I sunk into the couch! - But that's normal. Who are you going with? Dr. Antoine Geller, the head of "Humanit-Aid." He's becoming a habit! No... not at all. You mention him often. - Really? - Yes. But you'll see, he's a... really smart guy... cultivated, very generous... speaks 1 1 languages. Eleven languages? What for? For his job. How stupid of me. I wasn't thinking. I can't even speak one... You rarely talk about work. No, everything's fine. The museum asked me to restore a Toulouse-Lautrec. That's wonderful! I'd need a security vestibule... burglar alarms... - Hire people, expand... - That's good. I don't need that. I don't need a thing. Yes, I do need one thing. You. Here are the three Qrums. Here, rinse them in the lake. Fill the basket with mililiou. Goodnight, honey. Are you getting up early? Not tonight, Remy. I'm tired... - Is that tired? - Cut it out! Please be nice. I mean it. I'm tired. I'm sorry. You know how long it's been? Not tonight. A month and a half! - That's nothing. - It's something. What's Antoine Keller like? Now I've heard it all. Why not Antoine Geller. Goodnight. The Butterfly King will come and he will Fly above our heads. Come, leave your world and free us. Lucile! - Who wants a coffee? - I'll have one. Jean-Louis! Can we have 4 coffees? - Jean-Louis!. - Yeah, Serge? Right away, Serge. - Are you Remy Bassano? - It's him. Hello... I have a job for you. I work across the street. I'm coming. I'll finish my coffee. Can I see that? Sorry, excuse me... He bumped into you and you apologized. I do that all the time. There's a lot of damage. Too bad it's been recently varnished. I'll prepare an estimate. Are you Toulouse-Lautrec? You bet! - This is for Mr. Lautrec. - I've been waiting. Prove you're Lautrec. It's not on the door. It's a joke. I'm not Toulouse-Lautrec. It's addressed to Lautrec. Lautrec's a painter. I do restoring. I have to restore a drawing of his. I'm not Toulouse-Lautrec. I'm Remy Bassano. This is no laughing matter. Sign here. But I need a... There's a pen. Can I get it? Go ahead. I was just joking... Got a problem with drop-outs? I never fiinished school myself. So is it a problem? That's what I'm saying... Watch what you say. It's not Lautrec. It's Bassano. I'll write you out a receipt. - Why are you here? - Hello. You're a life-saver. See you at 6. Hi, Daddy! No way! It's Friday. I'm swamped. Yeah but I can't reach Suzanne. Thanks, honey. See you, kids. Hey, munchkins! Daddy has to work, so you can draw. Don't touch a thing, okay? I'll do your receipt. No, Theo! Put that down! - I want it! - It's not a game! I want to play! It's turpentine. It's dangerous! Here's your receipt. Not the Lautrec. Take the turpentine! Sorry about this. I was joking. Put that down! Theo, Lisa, why don't I hear you anymore? I'm putting make-up on her. That's not paint for bodies! Wait, I'm not done yet. Happy, Picasso? She stole my color pencils. Is that true? I'm sorry. It ran on. Don't ever do this again! They trashed the place. - I wasn't out having fun. - I know. And I work too. - Let's go. Nana's waiting. - I'm sorry. And you know my mother. - What's that on your face? - Make-up. The doors leading to our world are now open. Nobody knows where the Savior will appear. Let's hurry. Zotan's soldiers approach. Hurry, let's go into the tower. Move, sir. You can't stay here! Get out now! We're starting the pump. Get out of here! - Go outside, sir. - Wait! No, leave now. These objects are priceless. Come on, we're starting the pump. Hold on! There's still lots of stuff here! What the hell is this? Kid! The savior. He appeared in the lake. He brought sacred images with him. Take it easy! Are you okay? You almost drowned there! There was a lake. People were talking... You'll tell me outside. Let's get out first. What happened here? I was flooded. I left the faucets running. And your Toulouse-Lautrec? I saved it. Yours too. Don't worry. Pierre Demazure, claims adjuster. You were barely insured. It's terrifying. For you. Can I see you later in the week? Now is not... Of course, there's no rush. When you say "insured"... I'm covered, right In fact... We'll see. We need to talk. You scared me! Where were you? I called all day! I'm in trouble. My studio was flooded. No way! Over the entire week-end. I have to say something. And something else really weird happened. And my insurance... He hit on me. - Who did? - I'm confused. I'm in love with someone else. It's Antoine. Antoine Cellar? Geller. You never look at me, never listen. What I don't look at you? I always do. Yes, he's downstairs. Cellar is downstairs? Why? Because I want a divorce. Lucile... you know what you're saying? - Yes, but it's your fault. - Mine? You asked so many questions, you put Antoine in my head. You had sex? Not yet. - Not yet? - No! You intend to? You dare say "not yet"? He's downstairs. Quiet... he may hear. I'll talk to him. They're my pants. I'm sorry. Don't make a scene. Hello, Remy... Antoine Geller. Sorry about the flood. Was there much damage? I'm really sorry. Life's tough... Can I go sit down? Sure, you can. Things can't get much worse. In any case I'm cool if you want to stay here till you find a studio or a small apartment. Even a friend with a futon. No regrets? Honey, don't make things harder than they are. I'll leave you. I'm glad we could... Me too... Poor boy, what are you going to do? - I rushed over. What's up? - Simon! - You okay, sweetie? - Yes, Mom. Hey. Lucile left him and he's out of work. What's he going to do? We don't know yet. Did you sell the Volvo? One smart cookie! Cool. Dad, I can get you a jacket like mine. It's gorgeous. Three colors. You choose. Is there navy blue? - The coffee must be ready. - I'll go. Don't. You'll never manage. I'll manage. Is Kitty hungry? Kitty? What the hell? Mom, there's a problem with Kitty! Short-circuit! Mom! I'm sinking! I'm sinking! Can you hear me? Help! Get me out of here! Mom? Where the hell am l? Dad? Anyone here? Kitty? Is that you? Gentlemen, excuse me! Sorry to interrupt your meal... Where am l, in fact? Near Sarclay? Because I was having coffee at my mom's place... Hi, ma'am. What are you doing here, mister? Are you hungry? I don't understand a thing. He doesn't seem to understand. It's your dumb-ass accent. Are you hungry or not? Is Paris that way? We'll feed you to our Master. You don't exist. Yes, he does. What do you want? Careful! I'm calling the cops! Hello? Police precinct? I'm Remy Bassano. I'm calling because l... I'm in the middle of being mugged by... No, you mustn't go there! Leave me alone! Is anyone here? I can hear you breathing. Is anyone here? Hello, sir... I was bitten! Remy? Are you okay? - I need help. - Anything broken? What happened? I was bitten. The mugs are above the fridge! It's the cat... I loved that French press! Now it's destroyed. I told the neighbors to shut the water when they leave. You did not! I'll clean up and make some coffee. Where do you keep the filters? Not there. There's no fracture. You're lucky. I'm more worried about your neck. It looks like a bite. Huge jaws. Need a sleep aid? Can I tell you something? In the kitchen, something wild happened. Twice now. It was as if I was... sucked into the floor. I was in a world... Forget it. Go on... It's normal. You're in shock. Is that the right time? Yes. Look. Both say 4:.1 2! They can't both be wrong. I was in a time warp. You need a shrink? No, thanks anyway... It's just a time warp. I checked your insurance plan. Itwas inadequate. I'm Juliette Bivel from the Jules Joffrin Museum. Unless you pay back my clients, they intend to prosecute. I can't pay them back. I'm broke. I'm evicting you. I don't want your business here. Imagine if these products had caught fire! I'm sorry. It was an unfortunate accident... Building inspector. I see safety violations everywhere. I'm Mr. Gandin. I represent the APl. I came to inform you we're filing a civil suit. - Against me? - Obviously. Will you declare bankruptcy? But ma'am... I have a sinking feeling your bank won't back you. Am I sinking? I'm sinking! Can you see me sinking? The Butterfly King will now appear... and enable us to fight the powers of evil. Unbelievable! Our king will free us with his Firepower! I don't understand. He is starting to chant! Hail to the king! ButterFly King, could you please fly over our heads. Show your strength to our enemies. Fly, Butterfly king, Fly! I can't Fly. Fly or we'll drown you in the lake! You're sure I'll fly? Yes. Not splatter? No. Strange how he refuses to Fly. But that was a cool fall. Idiots! Master? Hold him. Can you understand me now, Master? - Let the berry work. - I don't understand. - Do you understand me now? - I don't understand. No understand! Understand what I Sayo fani, Master? The little berry did its trick, Master. You understand our language and we naya too. Welcome to the miokti. Why are you calling me Master? Explain! I penetrated the secret of the Maleedja! The prophecy is coming true! A savior from the other world will come rescue us. He will kill Zotan, the cannibal tyrant! We've been waiting so long, Master! Welcome to our miokti. A king will come. He will save us and then... Quiet! Quiet! Now he understands our miofoul. He shouldn't know the rest of the prophecy. What prophecy? I don't understand at all! Are these your heavenly plans for saving us? Hold on! These are my insurance papers! - Come see, Master. - See what? Before nightfall! They say he has 3 heads and he's fat, maybe. He's blind and says eating villagers will bring his sight back. Eating villagers? His soldiers chased you that day. Where are we going? Come see their village. No one can lay siege to it. Except you. Now you'll be able to kill them all. I don't want to kill anyone! You'll pierce Zotan's heart! - Pierce his what? - Heart! You are very brave, Master. That's his cavern. His tribe lives near it. Here are the dried animals and fruit peels that the prophecy calls for, Master. Now... you can... destroy their village. Destroy their village? With this? We don't know how to go about it. You're the magician. I do card tricks with my kids. Find someone else. Honestly, I'm not at all... the man for the job. - You're our savior. - I'm not. I'm no one's savior. I'm a painting restorer with a ton of problems. I don't save and I don't destroy. Enough with your rotten fruit, rat tails and dead bunnies. I have plenty trouble as it is, so let me go. I'm sorry. He doesn't know he's the chosen one. Yeah but... it's not him. Lift me up! I'll think it over! Okay, I'll be your savior! - And set us free? - All of you! Or we drop you. I get it! I'll have everyone set free! Pull me up! Now figure out how to free us from the tyrant. - I'm bad at that. - We don't care. Can I go down the other way? It's easier. - Thanks... - Go on! I'm hurrying... Move it! Move it! Good. Once you make up your mind, knock. This door here? Thanks a lot. What's the time? - What does this say? - 1 :30. What's the date? The 7th. They can't have broken together, the phone and the watch. Did I have a watermelon before? It appeared out of thin air, right? Thank you. Serge! Can I have a word with you outside? We have work to do here! Please, 5 minutes! I need to see my friend. Did you see me sink into the floor? - lnto the Floor? - Like it swallowed me. Did you see? You didn't see. Serge... I am the victim of a shift in the space-time continuum. You know Einstein? Time and space are the same thing. So listen, something wild has happened to me. Time stops! And I'm projected into another space. It's a space with people, but time is not the same. One millisecond here equals 3 days there. And there's a guy there, a man-eating monster... They chose me as a master-savior... - Hello. - Hello. Excuse me. I was going to see you. It's not ready. - The estimation? - No. No problem. - How about on Friday? - Yes, sure. Salvage anything else? - Yes. - Great! I'm glad. I was worried. - Worried about what? - About you. - Me? - See you Friday. Okay, see you then. Sorry, but... - What's your name? - Delphine. - See you Friday, Delphine. - See you. She was worried. So what was I saying? A man-eating monster... Oh yeah! They think that I'm their savior. But listen: I'm not their savior. But if they notice I'm not, I'm dead! I'll deal with the flood. You never managed stress well. Is this stress? No, it's a watermelon! Don't mention this to anyone. Promise me. You promise: if it happens again, you'll hear me out, even if you don't believe me. Of course. I'm looking for a book about... Begameni. About what? Begameni. Rimekiel. Zotan. Are they authors? Not exactly. More like a people, a country, a world. Where is it? - I don't know. That's why l... - Let's look. - The other name? - Rimekiel. Where did you hear about them? Do you have any... self-defense manuals? Like speed Aikido. Or body-building in 1 0 steps or less. - Yes. - You do? - What did you do about your studio? - Nothing. I'll go on unemployment. I'm sick of painting. I slave away just to end up in deep shit. I'm sick of the arts. What will you do? I'll ask the Job Center. - You really want to change jobs? - Yes. I love your job. Loved it. What do you care now? We can find you a place to start over in! I don't want to. Who wants a yummy protein shake? Who wants big muscles like Daddy's? Did you buy that watermelon? Yes. Well-proportioned, huh? Zotan has struck again. Without you we'll die. I'm not your savior! This is unbelievable. Our ancestors made this sword for when our savior comes. It is for you. What should I do? Help us leave. I'll help. Then we call it quits! Yes, Master. - What's that way? - Freedom. So why not go? If more than two of us go, a lightning storm will break out and we'll perish. You should already know this. Vatr Mai Line himself told me so when I was young. And who told Vatr Mai Line? Nit Pook Gilo, the village elder, told Vatr Mai Line as a teen. And Lars Tine Vogon told it to Nit Pook Gilo when he was 8. Rumor has it that Goom Nasse Lili told it to Lars Tine Vogon. But who told Goom Nasse Lili? I don't know. - Who was the first - No idea. But you should know because... You never tried crossing those rocks? kid! Come here, my boy. Go tell the others. We're leaving. We're going there. To build a new kingdom. Okay, kid? Let's get going. Yeah, but we're all going to die. Am I your savior or not Glory to our Savior! See? Come on, let's go! There's no storm! Master... Can I ask you a question? Why didn't you want to fly the other day? Didn't feel like it. Can you change the shape of the mountains, just to see? Not now. Can you shake that sun around? Rimekiel, please shut up and walk! Can you make the sun set faster? Can you change the direction of the waves? It's not him. I'm positive it's not him. Why are you in the forest? You want to be struck by lightning? Remy Bassano. They're my people. I'm Chief. I mean... their savior. Let us through! If you got a problem with that, I'm the head honcho. I didn't hear you. Who are you? Sorry but... your hair is in my mouth. I'm their chief. Thanks. That was a hoot. Get back home, slaves, on the double! Think it over: two of you vs. thousands of us. Come on! - Everyone, freeze! - Careful. As a kid I used to fence with Remy Pelletier... And I wasn't too bad. So don't wake my beast within. Careful! I can be ridiculously violent! Attack! Come help me! Don't leave me alone! Attack! Come help me! Come help! Don't leave! Come help! We cannot take part in a sacred battle. You're crazy. Zotan will kill you. He'll take back every slave. He'll start a war for what you've done. You're all going to die! I'm sick of your superstitions. I almost died! It's written in the prophecy. "He will kill the tyrant's soldier in the forest... alone!" Where are they taking him? I'll go prepare him. Bite-size morsels for everyone! We eat him. To get his strength. A tradition of ours. Stop that, on the double!. Stop, this is an order! Listen up. No one is eating anyone! Understood? We don't eat people! We eat fruit, we eat... chocolate bars... candy... Master! It's war! Zotan and his troops. What do we do? It's back to the tower! RelaX! No one's going back to the tower. Trust me. "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu. Chinese. It's a must. Everything you need to wage a war. Next... "The Prince" by Machiavelli. For governing and manipulating the masses. Interested? Very much so. Just what I'm after. "The 36 Strategies". A secret treatise on Chinese strategy. 3000 years old. I'll take it. "On War" by karl Von Clausewitz. Essential reading as well. I'll take it. What do you want these for? Starting a war? Not at all. They're reference books. Do you need weapons? There's a very good gun store down the street. Now that you mention it... Do you think a bullet proof vest stops spears? I don't know. Probably. I think so. Why not? In fact, to tell you the truth, I'm starting a company and I want to improve my group management skills. You're scared your employees will throw spears at you? You never know. The end of war is victory, placing us... in position number 4. There's an opening. And now I'm in the center. - Daddy! - What is it? Lisa didn't watch the chicken. It's all burnt. Can't you see I'm working? Can I play with you now? Put that down right away. Play with your sister. Or the deep-fryer. You never play with me. I want less light! We'll attack tomorrow. Go tell them right away. We'll attack tomorrow in the day. Heights are better for troops than low, deep areas. We're high up. Now we set up camp facing south because that's what most fertile. Address the people. What for? Give them courage. They're scared. I only have two hands. - It's important. - Okay, I'll go. - You have to hurry. - Do you mind? You've been, for far too long... Speak up! the slaves... and the food supply, to be frank, of a vile monster. A blind, cannibalistic tyrant. He's not the first... but he will be the last! It's time to fight! Time to fight for our freedom! Keep covered tonight. It's chilly. Wear scarves. Louder! Hats. And for those with delicate fingers, mittens. I want no swollen hands! We're going to win! Cara, come here. Wait for me in my bed. Not you. Bali... you see Cara? She's with me now. I want you to do me a favor. I want to relaX a little before tomorrow's war. I thought maybe you could find me a couple of other girls... Get my drift? Can I join in, Master? It's something I've always wanted to try so I'd prefer to do it alone. You know what Get me four. First some fun, then... no more slavery! Okay, I'll go. Get me six! Please let me join in. I'm very valiant. Bali, I'm sure you're valiant, but I'll manage alone. I can prepare them, so you won't wear yourself out. Or else I can watch you and... No thanks. I'll be Fine, Bali. Okay? When I say no, I mean it. Go get them for me. I smell of sweat. What? I smell like sweat. What do I care? Get lost! Yes, get going. No, stop. I'm sorry. I keep thinking of Lucile. Lucile, my wife. I can't help it. I miss her. We can amuse ourselves and you watch. - How about a breast rub-down! - You won't have to move. You turn me on, but I can't... Boiling water on your back? No, Boubs. Thanks anyway. Should we leave you? No, I'm happy to talk. I like having you here. When did you notice she loved you less? I didn't see it coming... She said it one night and the guy was downstairs. I didn't know what to do, so... I apologized. Apologized? But why? No idea. I always apologize. Maybe because I'm the 7th of 8 kids. I never found my place. When I arrived, all the roles had been taken. The cute one, the artist. Rebel was already taken. In the end... I shut up. And apologized. It sounds as if you never knew how to claim your place. That's exactly it. Cara, that's it! I can't Find a place of my own. I'm entitled to a place like everyone, right? We're all entitled to one. Try to understand where the guilt is coming from. I agree he should, but perhaps it's too soon. It needed to be said. What if we all lick each other for you? Good idea. - Dad! - Theo? Tell Rimekiel to count to 1 00. What's wrong? Why aren't you asleep? Will I see you after you move? Sure you will. I'm your Dad. I love you. Did Lisa and I do something wrong? Of course not. It's more complicated. Why do people in love break up? That's a very good question... I have no answer. I don't know. Don't think about this. I'm busy, so get to sleep. Why the police vest? This is because... I have valuable paintings that need protecting. Don't worry. When you do, your sister worries. Go to sleep now. - Goodnight, Dad. - Goodnight. I don't believe it... I'll try. Shit. No, not now! Shit! Rimekiel... are you there? Master! Come here! Damn it, try to be punctual! I was in bed! Sorry, I counted 3 lizards and they attacked! What do I do? I can't wage a war barefoot! I have your shoes. I kept them for you. They want us back in Begameni. Hold on! Follow me! We have to climb as high as possible! Come on, hurry! Night is falling. Don't light any fires. Gather all the branches you find. And rope. Lots of rope. Bird feathers. I need feathers. And this tree trunk. I want it. Come on, hurry! "Know your position. Locate yourself." I'm here. They're there. "The opponent can be useful..." Rimekiel, when does the sun rise? In 3 lizard tails. But Zotanians wake up late. Hurry, we have no time to lose. Careful, careful... Okay, that's fiine. Now get going! Peek-a-boo! Rise and shine! Who wants a wake-up slap? Get up, you Filthy pigs! Ass-wipes, get your butts out of the sand! You asked to be woken at 6. Sleep well, asshole? It's included. Tea or coffee? Tea! I mean coffee! Who wants a nice morning thrashing? You, Fatso! How about a rock to start the day? Morning, sunshine! Come on, I'll take you on one at a time! Go ahead! What's going on? Let's go down! Where is he? Come fight! Come fight! - Let's head back. - Run! Where are you? Faster! I'll come back and kill you! Faster! Bring him to me! You're free! Can you believe it? Free! Cut that down. Flowers will be nice there. I want a straight street leading to the palace. I mean, home. Where does the sun rise? Sun 1 rises here... and sets there. Sun 2 rises there and sets there. Sun 3 rises there. Every other day it sets there. Good. Constant exposure. Hey, my friends, what are you doing here? The walls are much further apart. So I'll have one window overlooking the waterfall and, when I turn around, I'll see my... cliffs and mountains. Shall we build you bordellos? Bali, we'll talk about this later. Do we dig into the mountain? No, not at all. Respect my blueprints. Go around the forest, like this. I'll build a city... there! Another one... there! And a third one there! I'll build roads joining them and it'll be really pretty! Gorgeous, isn't it? I'll build a bridge from one bank to the other. Straighter. It's better, esthetically. Like this. Yes, perfect. Two columns on each side... We need a port. Remind me to invent boats. Honey? Would you like a vale of flowers? A rose valley? I'll have it irrigated. Any special color? Yes, red. Then red it will be! I love this job. I've always sensed that I had... hidden potential... I knew something big would happen. And look. What on earth is that? I built it, Master. By mixing bredlo and ciramine I created energy. I condensed it into a tube... But Loube, haven't you noticed how hard it is to steer? Yes, I have. If you put the motor on the vehicle, you could use your hands to concentrate on steering. True! Thank you, Master. What's this I see? - Pago! - Yes, Master. Come here. How high did I want the sidewalk? And how high is this? Not even 1 0 centimeters. Go change them all. Finished? Almost, almost... I'm sick of this. You're impatient. What do you think? Imagine her with arms. You're a genius. Genius? I admit it may meet with some success. Can I have a village there? With a river. You're right. We'll build you a village there. I love you, you know. I'm exhausted. But it's nice to be painting. June 23rd... February 9th! Daddy, we missed school. What? What school? It's because my alarm clock never... It did. You stopped it. Know what? I'm starving. I'll say you were sick. You'll go this afternoon. We'll enjoy our breakfast. Yogurt What is it? You're quiet. I don't like your beard. You've seen me with stubble. It's normal in the morning. - I don't like it. - Shit! Here I am. Hey, Remy. How are you, Antoine? I'm checking the hinges. - What's wrong, kids? - It's Daddy. - What did he do? - He's under there. His beard is this big! This woodwork is just excellent. I can't get over it. Did I scare you, kids? I put on a... fake beard. To scare the kids. See you later, kids. I got you good with the beard! - Are you okay? - Fine. Can I ask you something? Don't get angry... It's Antoine. He lent his place to some doctors for the week. He's with 4 Sudanese refugees. I said they could stay here for a couple nights. Are you okay? Remember one thing: I come back here only for the kids. Back from where? Nowhere. We need to talk. About Lucile. Lucile and l haven't done anything together. She won't allow it while you're there. And I can understand her... I've always understood women. It's one of my best gifts. I'd love it if you could Find a place soon. Do you have a friend you can stay with? Yes, I'll look into it. - How are your kidneys? - My kidneys? I don't like what I see. Not at all! Our kidneys are the center of energy in our body. All of our body's energy is here, in the kidneys. - Keep your hands off. - Why? You know, even if people like us make democracy prosper, we're no heroes! - Hands off. - But they are. I warned you... - They stand up to tyranny. - I told you. We don't have their courage. - Sorry about this. - And we never will. Democracy, Remy... What did I say? I said to keep your hands off! Get lost and shove your democracy up your ass! What the hell? You're crazy! Stop it, Remy! You scare me! What's going on? - We were discussing democracy. - Shut up! Look at him! No Remy, not my car! Not my car! Loser. Thanks, Remy. Is that you? I've changed. I'm having tachycardia. Get your ass out of the street! Move your ass, I said! Move your ass, I said! Get back in your car, sonny. Go your way. Of course. I'm sorry... I'm changing jobs. It's decided. Sir, come back! - May I go? - Yes, go my son. Have fun. You tried painting? Yes. And you found no buyers? No. Then you learned to restore artwork? Yes. Must we go back so far? In order to Find what suits you best. - Tell me everything. - Okay. What else can you do? I don't know. I can work in construction. Any eXperience? - I can manage a crew. - Really? You've done it before? As foreman? This is important! Tell me! What kind of sites have you worked on? - I built a city. - Be more precise. A city... with streets, houses, a downtown, a rose valley... A city. Put "architect"! - Got a diploma? - No, in fact. I learned it on the job. I can iron out tribal conflicts. That's not common! I've waged battles. Won wars. Politician. Add that to the list. How dumb do I look? Just lay off! I have an lndian restaurant. Handing out fliers. Minimum wage. Fine. I'll take it. Taj Mahal. Happy Hour till 1 0. Taj Mahal! Happy Hour till 1 0! Bye-bye! Taj Mahal. - I'm off. - Where to? A break. I'm telling you took a break. Come on, 5 minutes. I saw you. Your work is shoddy. Hand them out closer. Hello, sir! Taj Mahal! Happy tour till 10! Smile. You can. Just try. Make them happy. Go to work or you'll get Fired. Unless I keep quiet. You know what? Watch this! Don't go that way! The boss is hiding there watching! Honey-pie... here I am! What were you doing? I've been waiting. I was handing out fliers all afternoon. It was pouring. No one wanted any. It was terrible. How are you? Okay? Nice to be back home. Anything special happen in the kingdom since I left? I've thought it over. Know what? I'm asking Rimekiel to keep me here for good. No need to go home. I'm happier here. I have lots to do. - I missed you. - Me too. - Really? - Yeah. Let's just stay in and watch TV! Oh yeah, no TV. Let's lie down. Greetings, mason. Tell me. Once you've finished, can you build me a fountain by the cypress? Yes, Master. I wanted marble stairs! Marble? - Yes, sir. - Do it over. Happily. - Good day. - Good day, Master... and sorry! Beautiful child! Hi there! You're pretty! keep it up! I declare the session open. What do we have on the agenda? What about the humidity eating at our buildings? We can't dry the walls. Everything's falling in ruin. When will you get involved? I was hoping you'd ask. For that I found this: "Walls are dried by creating a hydrophobic barrier built into the base." Here. See if it can help you. Next. Spin me, spin me... Master! Speak. You mentioned something called... hold on... "glass windows". Transparent things that block wind. This is a little awkward. I forget how they're made. I sort of remember. You have to heat the sand a lot... I'll get the recipe. We're running out ofwater. What do you plan to do? I'm thinking. There's also the sewage problem. Your time is up. Spin me, spin me. Master! Bali. Your plant. What plant? The one you asked for. To increase your pleasure. What are you talking about? I never asked for plants like that. I'm busy. Spin me, spin me. - Master! - Speak. People say they're overworked. Many of us regret the days of Zotan. What are you saying? When I arrived, I was worshipped. I speak the truth. People want to leave. My people are happy. Facts are facts. Enough, I said. Bird of ill omen! Guard! Take him out of here. Spin me! Master! It's a bad time! It's important. Your people is leaving. What do you mean? They won't work anymore. They want Zotan. What's going on? No one loves me anymore? I'm sure this is the work of a few bad seeds. You should have killed Zotan. Stow it! I'm King, I do as I please. I'll squelch this revolt. I'll build them bridges and stables. I keep the idiots working. Why do they wreak havoc? What is this crap? Hello, men. May I ask why you walked off the job? We're fed up. We're packing and going home. You can't wreak havoc in my kingdom. Get back to work. We're fed up. We work nonstop. But you're free. Who cares? Lay off the freedom routine. We want to eat. But with Zotan you were slaves. Don't overdo life under Zotan. We weren't that bad off. You got us worked up. - I ordain you to work. - Shut up. - Who said that? - We're sick of you. I'm leaving. I prefer to eat under Zotan. You're no savior. I didn't ask for any of this! Yeah, blame us, coward! So the savior comes and all's well? You have to work for freedom! Enough! Who's going to save you? What a loser! Screw you! I'm the king and I say: "Screw you!" What a regal answer! Congratulations on that one! Get lost! Stupid two-bit prophet! Calm down! Violence leads nowhere. I understand your anger. Let me through. Down with freedom! Down with freedom! Long live slavery! Long live slavery! Long live Zotan! Back to the tower! Back to Zotan! There he is! Master! Master, what do we do? I'm leaving, Cara. I'm going home. - There he is! - And the prophecy? I don't care. You were right. I'm a sham. Don't call again. Never, Rimekiel! I'm sorry, Cara. I wasn't up to par. It's Remy. What are you doing here so late? Sorry, Serge. I'm sort of in trouble. Remember you mentioned some empty studios... Could you lend me one for a little while? Sure. This couldn't wait till tomorrow? You've got a smudge. It's nothing. Just an egg. Thanks. Jackie woke up and yelled at me. Sorry. All your stuff is in the shop across from Roger's. Stay as long as you want. Thanks a lot. Did that cannibal stuff all work out All taken care of. Two weeks later - Am I parked okay? - Don't worry. - I won't get a ticket - No. Make it fast. I don't want a ticket. - Do I need a haircut - It looks Fine. Hi there! - How are you? - Well. - How did they behave? - Awfully. They were just unbearable. Theo! Lisa! The idiot's not coming in? He's scared of you now. He can't stand violent people. - Hey, dipshit! - Stop! I found this under the couch. I'll put it away. What else? I miss you. I miss you a hell of a lot.

If you don't like it, just tell me. - May l? - Of course! I like it a lot. It was all dirty. Now it's Fine. How much do I owe you? Nothing at all. Why not Because... it saved my life. I almost gave up my profession. Working on this painting allowed me to... To enjoy what I've always done. If you like it, then... Ask me to dinner. Excuse me? Invite me out and we're even. I guess... I'll be going now. Thanks for the night out. Why? Thanks for the painting. Remy! I don't believe it! - Anyone here? - Master. Is that you Rimekiel? Aim for the heart. It'll be easy. What's going on? Everyone is waiting. He abandoned the prophecy. He let Zotan live. He said freedom can be learned. Pure nonsense. So you killed him? For the Maleedja! He was interpreting it. It must be followed word for word! It's total chaos. You must fiight Zotan! I'm not fighting anyone. Where are you? So you've come to kill me? RelaX! Come here! You're scared! Scared! Stop moving! You asked for it! I warned you. So? How does it feel? Careful! It really is him. Our King! The prophecy is realized! He killed Zotan! Long live the King! Now comes the last part of the prophecy. Now your people must... eat you. What? To assimilate your strength, your intelligence, your genius. You're freaking me out! Okay, okay... calm down. It's a great idea. I'll let you eat me. No problem. You'll be part of us. Forever! As the prophecy dictates. Our time will be one with yours. Once and for all. Are you okay? Yes, hello. I'm with someone who just fainted. Delphine! Someone, talk to me! I can't hear a thing! Delphine, I'm in big trouble! I have him! Here he is! Quiet! I'm your master! He's here! Does your husband faint often? He's not my husband.

Are you coming home with me? I'm not at your disposal. Ask Antoine. He's gone. I kicked him out. Really? It's becoming a habit. Are you coming? You were too mean to me. Itwas a one-month crisis. Itwas no one-month crisis. You jilt me then expect me to come back like that? - What? - I love you. - What is it? - Have you fallen asleep? Sorry, we're not coming. I put the meter on.

Even when they break up. - I don't get it. - I do. Go and play. I'll talk to Mom. Can I sit down? I wanted to see you. Been working? I came by plane. Yep. An amazing discovery at this farm near Lyon. A painting by Leonard da Vinci, and not any painting! An early study of the Mona Lisa by the Master. Perfectly conserved for 5 centurieS in this stable. Art history will ne ver be the Same. We can confirm undeniably that the painting was done by da Vinci himself at around the age of 5. It iS immature and clumsy...
