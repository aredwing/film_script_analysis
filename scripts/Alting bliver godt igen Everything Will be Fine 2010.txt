EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE Hi. - Hi. - You were home late last night. - What? - What? What? Do you know what this is? - A picture? - Come on, what do you think? It's our little son. His name is Serge. Hi. Your name's Serge? Yes, his name's Serge. - What if he doesn't like us? - He will. Don't you think? - Are you crying? Don't cry. - I'm not. I'm just happy. As soon as we get the final papers, we can go and get him. Are you okay? Tell me. Hakon needs the script by Friday, or he'll throw a fit. You'll finish it in time. Write one of the stories that hurt. I know you can. What the hell is the story? We're going to make a movie, we're going to make a movie... ... a movie about a war. - Hi. - What are you doing? - Shouldn't you be in class? - In an hour. - Can I come in? - Sure. - You look beautiful. - Thanks. This is not happening! - Pretend we're not here. - He's still there. - We don't open until 11. - Are you Ali? - Yes, I'm Ali. - Niels Finsen. - Military Intelligence. - Hello. - Can I talk to you for a moment? - Sure. Come into the kitchen. Thanks. - Coffee? - Please. Have a seat. You've given up your studies? - Just this semester. - Okay. - To be a plumber? - Yeah, well... My dad worked here. It's a good idea to get away from the books and get a taste of real life. That's why I'm here. We know you from your time as a conscript and got interested - - when we heard you were studying Persian. - You speak Farsi? - Yes. And Arabic. - You're a Muslim? - Yes. Could you be a little more specific? We'd like you to sign up again. As an interpreter. Six months of active duty to begin with. You'd make an ideal language officer. That means I'm going to war? When? Whenever you can. Now, preferably. But just as an interpreter. We'll protect you. We need people with your skills right now. Think it over a day or two, and I'll get back in touch. - Have a good day. - I'll be in touch, Ali. Thanks. - Did you hear that? - Yes. I was just headhunted. It will be fine. Here are the pictures from Thomas. They look good. - Hi, Hakon. - Hi, Jacob. - And the script is... - What? You'll have it finished by Friday? Stop it. I need to know one thing. I need to hear you say you're with me on this. - What? - It's just a movie, Jacob. No! If it were just a movie, it would all be rather pointless. Don't you think? - Don't start tripping on me again. - Tripping on you? - I'm just saying... - How do you mean, tripping? - What do you mean by that? - If you don't know, it doesn't matter. - So now it doesn't matter? - No... Let's just... You want to talk about this, or what? I want us to run through the final locations tomorrow. - Sure. We have a deal. - We have a deal, yes. See you tomorrow. Hakon. Hey! Hey... hey! Are you okay? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Damn it! Come here. Can you hear me? I'm going to get help. I will get some help. I will get some help. I'll be right back. I just need to... Get my bag. Get my bag out of here! I'll get you out of here. Damn it! I want to report that a man's been run over on Holmbrovej in Ramlose. It doesn't look good. Hurry. - Helena, we're going back to town. - What? - We're going back to town. - What's up? What's going on? Hey, what the hell is going on? - What's going on? - I just need to go to town. - Why? - I've got early meetings tomorrow. - Did you have a good day? - Probably not as exciting as yours. I've been packing for you and for me and for Serge. - This is crazy. You're miles away. - I'm not. - What's wrong? - Everything's fine. - You're keeping something from me. - Everything's fine. - Did you have a good day? - What? - Tell me about it. - I'm looking forward to the adoption. - So am I. - You're sure you've got time for that? Did you pick up the adoption papers at the State Administration Office? - They're coming tomorrow. - Promise me to take care of it? - I promise. - Good. Hold me. You do know you're the woman of my dreams? So what happens to me when you wake up? Hey there, beautiful. We're here. Where are we? - At the hotel. - Okay. Will you wait for me? What do you think? What are you doing in there? - What the hell are you doing? - I'll be right out. Come on. In here. We're going to do it in here. Wait here, and we'll be right in. - We're renovating. Sorry. - What's going on? I've been traveling for 48 hours, and I want to go home. Please sit down. This is a confidentiality agreement - - and the doctor's certificate stating you were sent home due to illness. You are not allowed to breathe a word about your stay at the Danish camp. The sentence for leaking secrets of state is up to 12 years. - I'm not ill. - You hurt your shoulder. And your work at the camp has made you mentally unstable. It's perfectly normal. Sign here and here. And then you get to go home. Now we'd like to take a look at your bag. - What's this? - My diary. Anything documenting your stay at the camp is to be handed over to us. Well, except these tourist snaps. It looks like you had fun. - Anything else? - No. Stand up, please. Empty your pockets, please. Welcome home. Everything will be fine. I promise. - Hi. Is Siri Falk in her office? - She just walked by here. - Hi, Siri. - Hi, Jacob. - Do you have a moment? - Sure. How are you? Long time no see, little brother. - Have you got a couple of minutes? - Sure. - Anything wrong? - I've got something to show you. - Promise me not to tell a soul. - Sure. - Do we have a deal? - Sure. - Do we? - God, you're annoying. Yes, we have a deal. Can I touch it? Let's go up here where we can be alone. - Can I open it now? - Yes, go ahead. What is this? Danish soldiers? Where did you get these? - I found them near the cottage. - How did you find them? - It's a long story. - And a very important one. What consequences could they have? Jacob, do you live in the real world, or are you completely self-absorbed? - What? - Do you read the newspapers? With the election coming up, if these photos were to come out... Photos of Danish soldiers committing atrocities. I can't look at them. Good. Good? Whose are they? Where did you get them? - I just came by them. - Christ, where did you get them? - I'm trying to help get them out. - Help who? - Are you in trouble? - No! I'm trying to do something. - This is too dangerous. - What do you mean? I bet others would like to get their hands on these photos. I'll give them to the news staff, and they'll look into it. No, I found them. Are you trying to take them? Stop it! You come asking me for help at work, and then you behave like that! - I found them, I'll handle it. - Great, bye. You go handle it. I know this reporter Michael. He's covered the war for ages. Give them to him, and he'll get the ball rolling. - Is he trustworthy? - Would I vouch for him, if he weren't? Give me his number then. Thanks. What's up? We're all waiting for you. - Manuel, what do you think? - It's great. Sune, switch off the work lights. - Perfect. - Great. We're ready to shoot here. - Let's go scout the airport. - I have another appointment now. - Tor is waiting for us at the airport. - I can't. - It's not up for discussion. Let's go. - Manuel can do this on his own. - Don't take off. Where are you going? - To talk to someone about the script. - Do it here. - No. Fuck! Hi. Is everything okay? Jacob? - Hi. - Hi. - Michael. - Thanks for coming. - Odd place, this. - I just happened to pass by, so... - You know Siri? - Sure. From Journalism School. We bump into each other now and then. It's a small world. You had something for me, she said. I've got some photos that... I think you ought to see. Just... Look. The Danish flag? Where did you get these? - Who took them? - I can't tell you that part right now. - I suppose you want me to print them. - That's the idea. I need to know more. I have to be 120% sure they're real. Sure. What do you need? I'd really like to talk to the guy who took them. Is that possible? - Is he in Denmark? - Yes. I don't know where. - But I guess I could find out. - Do that. What will happen to the g uy? I don't know. Is he afraid? - No. Those photos have to get out. - Damn right. If I can get them verified, we're going to print them. - You don't want me to keep them? - No, I'd better hold on to them. POLICE How can I help you? I'm here about a car accident last night. I'll get someone who can help you. This is the desk sergeant. A man wants to know... - Charlotte. - Jacob Falk. - This won't take long. - It's fine. Sit down. - What is this about? - A car accident last n ig ht. - Where and when? - About 3. Holm brovej in Ram lose. I just want to know how the man is doing, and I'd like to see him. - What's your role in the case? - My role? - Do you know the inj ured party? - No. Then I can't pass on that kind of information. I just want to talk to him. Oh, is it because I'm not related? - Yes. - Well, I am related. - You are? In what way? - I... - I was driving the car. - What car? I ran him over. - What's up? - Hit-and -run from last night. - But he hasn't reported it until now. - I called. Well, belated good morals are better than no morals at all. - Why didn't you turn up sooner? - I just want to talk to him. - Time and place of the accident? - Just after 3 last night. Holmbrovej in Ramlose. We sent an ambulance and a patrol car, but no victim was found. What? - That's what we call a false alarm. - No, it wasn't a false alarm. No reports have been made from any hospitals in the region. - Who went to the scene? - Kenneth. - Let me speak to Kenneth then. - No, that's impossible. - Impossible? - Impossible. Let's wrap it up here. - You're hiding something from me. - Goodbye. - Thank you for your time! - This way, please. - Hi. Are you Kenneth? - What are you doing in here? Kenneth? Your colleague said you went to the car accident last night. - Yes. Who are you? - Jacob Falk. What happened? I can't tell you. You can't be in here. You have to leave. I had the misfortune to hit the man. - What man? - The man who was run over. Did your colleague just tell you to keep quiet? I don't know what you're playing at, but I want you to leave this area. Were you just ordered to keep quiet? You did go to the scene, right? - Did the military tell you to shut up? - Goodbye. Why did you return so soon? Because I saw something I shouldn't have seen. And so they sent me home. What's going to happen now? I don't know. - Yes. - It's Michael. Did you find him? No. It's strange... I haven't found him. - Damn! - I have one more place to check. My editor and I have decided to have an expert examine the pictures. - If he okays them, we'll print them. - Great. Can we meet tomorrow? Say at The Polar Bear at 11? - Why not at the paper? - Want to keep this a secret? Then we'll do it my way. See you tomorrow. Hello? Is anybody there? - Jacob. - Lemmy. What on earth are you doing here? - Is anything wrong? - Lemmy... - Where's Ali? - Who? You don't know Ali? You did notice the broken window, didn't you? Yes, and I've called the glazier. - Cut the crap, Lemmy. - What? You want to help him, and so do I. It's fine! I need to talk to him. - When did you ever help anyone? - Well, I'm trying to now. You can only help yourself, but you're not much good at that either. Do you want me to call your sister? No. Sorry I bothered you. Hey, stop! Not the photos, not the photos, not the photos. Shit! Helena? - Helena! - You frightened the life out of me. Relax. - Sorry, I just thought... - What's wrong? - Nothing... Nothing. - What did you think? I didn't think anything. Sorry. You always do this. You always get obsessed with your movies, and then you can't see... ... anything else. Everything I do, I do for you. Yeah... Helena... If you love me that much, I assume you got the adoption papers? I will get them tomorrow. Tomorrow. THE POLAR BEAR - Is everything okay? - Someone broke into my car. - That doesn't sound good. - They stole the photos. Are you serious? Did you call the police? I don't know, if I can trust the police. - Who have you told about all this? - My editor. No one else at the paper. - Someone must've talked. - Well, not me. I can keep my mouth shut. I do it for a living. Okay? - Any idea who it might be? - No... The military perhaps. I haven't got a clue. I've got a diary that probably belongs to the guy who took the photos. Ali. Well, that's something. My contacts might be able to help us. Listen. Before you do anything else, get yourself a new SIM card. Text your new number to this number. And I'll call you back. That way we can talk without being monitored. Talk to you later. - Michael.. - Yes. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. They didn't find them. - I hate you. - I'm sorry. I have to go away. Alone. I know where you can go. - Yes? - Where the hell are you? - In town. - What are you doing? - It's a long story. - I've got time. Tell me. - I'm working. - I want the script on Friday. - I'm on it! I'm sorting out the story. - Just work on the movie! Yes? I've found a soldier who spent the past six months down there. - We can see him later today. - When? Pick me up at the metro at 3, and we'll take it from there. - Hi. Impressive. - Wasn't it? - Where was he posted? - Rasmus? Camp Viking. - Good. - Why? Ali was at Camp Viking too. That red car is tailing us. - Sure? - He changes lanes when we do. What do we do? I haven't tried this kind of thing before. - Yes? - Hello. Michael Jelling. - This is a colleague of mine, Jacob. - Come in. - Outside. The kids are asleep. - Fine. - You were there recently, right? - Yes, for six months. I came back three weeks ago. - How many were you? - At our camp we were about 200. - Your camp was Camp Viking? - Yes. - Were you a tight-knit group? - I'd say that. - You knew most of them? - Yes. - Do you know a soldier called Ali? - He was an interpreter. - Not a soldier. A civilian interpreter. - I don't know anyone by that name. - Maybe he used another name. - No. - You don't know him? - No. - Did any interpreters get into trouble? - How do you mean? - Was anyone sent home before time? - Not that I know of. - You didn't hear about any problems? - No. - Sure, life at the camp was carefree. - Jacob, calm down. He's answering our questions, isn't he? Hang on. Excuse me. Michael speaking. - Why don't you admit you know Ali? - Because I don't. I could tell right away that you know Ali. And I could tell you weren't going to admit it. How much are they paying you to shut up? - I don't know what you're on about. - So you won't say a thing? You have to live with this. Can you look your kids in the eye after this? - Shut your mouth. - Oh yeah? - Yes, shut your mouth. - Are you in the photos? Is that it? - You're in deep shit. - What's your problem? - You have to live with this forever. - You've got a problem. Piss off! - We've wasted two hours on this! - What happened? - Jacob, wait. - It's so obvious. Who pays Rasmus? The military. Of course he's lying about Ali! - My contact vouched for him. - And he's trustworthy? - Says who? - I do. - And who are you? - What? Who are you? After I met you, the photos get stolen - - and then you take me to a guy who's out to convince me Ali doesn't exist. - Who do you work for? - I'm not listening to this. No way! I did this as a favor to Siri. - I used my contacts to help... - Find you own way home. Take the train. Where the hell have you been? Did you finish the script? Let me see. Hands off. You'll get your copy on Friday. - Here they are. When did this come? - What? It's the adoption papers I've been waiting for. What are you talking about? They've made a mistake. This guy Karl Nyhansen has... It's filled out wrong on purpose. It's the adoption papers. Imagine the consequences, if I hadn't noticed. It's so clear to me now. - They want me to let Helena down. - Calm down. They're trying to ruin me, because I'm trying to ruin their war. - Where are you going? - I've got more important things to do! Come back, and let's talk about this in a civil way. Jacob! I'm going to shut down the movie! THE STATE ADMINISTRATION So we have to examine the case again. I need to talk to Karl Nyhansen. Excuse me. Karl Nyhansen. - Have you got an appointment? - Appointment? - Yes. - No, I need to see him now. - You'll have to take a number. - He knows I'm coming! If you don't have an appointment, you have to take a number. - You misunderstand. Let me talk... - I understand perfectly. - Take a number. The procedure... - I need to talk to Karl Nyhansen! Nyhansen! - Hey there. - Nyhansen! - Can I help you? Calm down now. - Can't I talk to Karl Nyhansen? - You have to go to the reception. - Why is that door locked? Why are you touching me? Because you work for the state, right? The state has got a monopoly on violence. What's behind that door? - You have to follow the ru les. - I'm perfectly calm. - I told you not to go in there. - I'm perfectly calm. Relax! Can't I talk to my friend here? - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? I just want to talk to you. Let's go in there. I'm freezing. - Have you got anything hot to drink? - Coffee. Two black coffees. Come and sit down. - What's that? It looks... - I bum ped my head getting in the car. - What happened? It's deep. - It's just a scratch. Why are you looking at me like that? - I love you. - I love you too. Sweetie pie. - Hakon called me. He's worried. - Hakon called you? - I got worried. - Don't be. When people worry about my kid brother, I come running. I'm fine. He said you're going to start shooting soon. That's great. - Is that stressing you out? - No, it's great. Lovely. Thanks. Siri, I'm in kind of a hurry. I thought it would do you good to chat with your big sister. Look... I ended up shouting at Hakon, but I'll talk it out with him. I'm fine. - What? I'm telling you, I'm fine. - I don't believe you. - You don't believe me? - I know you. I can tell you're not. Stop pretending to care about me. We gave that up long ago. I'm not pretending. I'm really worried about you. Is it the photos? Something tells me they're stressing you out. Did Michael ask you to talk to me? - Why do you think that? - Because he wants to stop this story. Michael is a reporter and as such obliged to check if the photos are real. - You've talked to him? - Sure. That story could have been... Could have been? It is... a huge story! The state has end less funds and a monopoly on violence. Think about it. Why am I crazy? - You sound like a conspiracy lunatic. - Okay, so now I'm a lunatic. I don't have time for this. I need to find the mastermind. - Sit down. - Why do you want me to sit down? - Sit down. - Are you involved? Stop this nonsense. What am I supposed to be involved in? - Why are you keeping me here? - Be q uiet! Why are you keeping me here? Are they at the hotel? In my room? - Are you supposed to keep me away? - Sweetie, come back. Helena. No! - Have you seen my wife leave? - No. - Maybe she was with a man. - I haven 't seen her. Where is she? Who are you working for? - Papers! - Where is my wife? I deliver newspapers morning and night. Ali? Ali? Who...? What are you doing here? I love him. Do you? I won't say anything. Oh, I thin k you will. Can you hear me? Where are they? Where are Helena and Ali? - Where are they? - Who are you? What do you want? I don't have time for this! Dad, who are you talking to? Who are you? Go back to bed, sweetheart. - I can't sleep. - Go back to bed now! - Take it easy! - Nobody leaves until I find Helena. Calm down. Calm down. Falk? Jacob Falk. It's all your fault. You know that, don't you? But you can't stop me now. I'm going to get my son - - and then I'll find Helena and Ali, and then everything will make sense. I understand, but... Let's take it nice and easy. Sit down. Go back to bed. It's okay. Go back to bed. - Who is he? - He's a man who's very unhappy. Can I do anything? I'd like to help you. I can understand why you're upset. Let me just take this. Is there anyone I can call? Have you got a phone? Let me just check your pocket. I'll call someone who knows you. Good evening. Karl Nyhansen. He's upstairs. I work for the State Administration. I did their paperwork for the adoption. He's in here. Hi, Jacob. Jacob, darling. What are you doing here? Let's go home and work things out. Let's go home. Let's get some fresh air. I'm sorry. Ouch. I've really messed things up. I've started something, I can't control - - and now someone needs me, but I let him down. - Are you lost in a story again? - It's not my movie. The man exists. His name's Ali, or so I think. All I know is... Because of me he's in deep trouble, and now... - Jacob... - I've ruined it, like I always do. I've just ruined everything. Stop it. Please, Jacob. I miss her so much. I understand. I understand, sweetheart. THE CZECH REPUBLIC - Hi. - Good morning. - Get any sleep? - Not much. - I hope nothing goes wrong. - What could go wrong? It'd be just our luck to have something go wrong at the very last minute. Nothing is going to go wrong. Very soon we'll have our son. Don't worry. In a few hours we'll have everything we ever dreamed about. It's a big day. How big? - Very big. Huge. - Huge. - As huge as my nose? - Almost. We've got two hours left to let our hair down - - and be completely irresponsible for the last time. The clock is ticking. Now we've only got 1 hour and 57 minutes left. Have we got everything? Check again. - You forgot...? - Two minutes. Hurry up! I've got it. What's so interesting? A civilian interpreter claims he witnessed atrocities against prisoners. Ready? Damn, you look beautiful. - We have to get off here. - Now? - Didn't you check them? - Sure. We'll work it out. It's just a delay. The plane tickets can easily be... Be what? The plane tickets can easily be altered. Well, isn't that great? - I asked you to do this one thing. - Yes. - Just this one thing. - Yes. One single thing. You had to make sure the papers were fine. That's all you had to do. But they aren't. Didn't I ask you to check the papers? Yes, but it's just not important to you. - Yes, it is. - No, then we would've had him now! We should've had him! You didn't find it important because of your work! We should have had him now! Do you hear? He's waiting for us, and we can't get him! We should have had him now! Don't touch me! Don't you touch me! Helena! Helena! Everything will be fine. I promise.
