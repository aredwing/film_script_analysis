You're more important to me than any fucking amount of money! Do you understand that? - Fuck! What the fuck? You wanted me to do this. You, you got me into this! - Fuck! I'm sorry. It's just.. I used to get booked. - Fuck. - Now nobody wants me. They just want you. - Are you kidding me? - They just want you. - They're all fuckin', dirty old men, okay? You think I fucking care? They don't fucking mean anything to me. - The first time I met you.. ...I said I wanted you to make me jealous. Well, I guess I got my fucking wish. Fuck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're the only one I've ever loved. You know, it's the same thing for me. Look. You're the only one ever. - I love you so fucking much. I go crazy. - I love you, too. Where's the Kiehl's counter? I need some products. - I think you've shopped enough. - Please? Come on. Don't you want me to stay looking young? - Okay. Okay. Fine. How was your mani-pedi? - I don't know. I've had better. - Oh. You still reading about yourself? Obsess much? - If one more fan dedicates a blog to me, I will just die. - Oh. So, um, I think I wanna take the Vegas gig. They wanna pay me five grand just to, like, sit and sign DVDs. - No. No. No. They'll just paw at you and annoy you. If they wanna see you, they can just buy the videos. - Please? Pretty please? We'll see. - That's what you said about horseback riding. I wanna ride a horse. I thought you wanted to learn how to make movies. - I do. - Okay. Well.. Here's the record button. - I know. Here's the zoom and the mount, right? I know. And this is a very -- - I know. I've seen you do it enough. - Well, you don't know about auto focus and -- and w -- white balance. All those things. - Oh, I don't? Let's find out. And action. - No. Now, what are you doing? No. Stop! Please. And here we have King Cobra, porn producer. Whose neighbors have no idea what goes on here in this cookie-cutter community. - Stop it. - Tell me about your first time. - No, look. I'm a behind-the-camera guy. Alright? - Please? - You really wanna know? - Yeah. - Alright. I was in college. I know, late bloomer. I used to go out with my buddies every night my best friends, and they were always trying to hook me up with girls and I'd find some way to mess it up. I was terrified to tell them the truth. Well, we, uh, we go to this house party and there's this guy that I've seen before even had some classes with and.. I look over and he's staring right at me. I'm thinking, no way. I mean, he's so cute. So we, uh, we sneak out of the party. He takes me back to his place and we have sex. Well, that's fucking amazing. I felt free. But somebody saw us leaving and told my friends about it. They couldn't believe it so they come over, barge right in see us both laying there in bed together. They disappeared after that. So a few years ago I decided to just do what I love. Even if people despise it, think it's dirty, trashy I don't give a fuck. Same goes for who I'm attracted to. People think I'm a dirty old man for liking boys who look like you. Fuck 'em. Hm. You have no idea how lucky you are. Be so confident at such a young age. You have the Internet, so you never have to feel alone. I just feel like I'm making up for lost time. It's fucking depressing. - Hey. - Seanny.. ...please just make me feel wanted. - Excuse me. Yeah? - I'm your neighbor. We haven't really met yet. I live next door. - Mm-hmm. - Well.. How old are you? - Eighteen. Why? - Well, um, I've just seen a lot of young boys coming and going from the house. I didn't know if they're your friends or his friends or.. - He makes gay porn. - Ah! Pretty princess finally decided to show up for work. Let's go! - So sorry. I didn't realize you were here. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Brent. - Mikey. - Sean, what are you wearing? Those are too flashy. - You don't know what Brent likes. - I think it looks cool. - Thanks. You have the tape recording, right? - Yes. - Good. I need to emote what I'm thinking. - Okay. Action. - Eighteen years old, I'm stuck in the suburbs cleaning this pool all day for my cousin. I guess I should be grateful for this job. Pool boy. Sure is nice out. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I took a dip. - Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? - The water looked nice. I wanted to get wet. - You have to finish your chores first. Come here. You just bought yourself another chore, boy. Mm.. - Okay, cut! I said cut! Come on. We're on a schedule. We gotta move inside. - Sorry. - No. - Alright. Would you please turn it down? I'm tryin' to work. - What? - Turn it down! - If it's too loud, you're too old. - Don't you have to go home? - No. - So what's your deal? You, like, live here or something? - Yeah. I mean, temporarily. - Why don't you get your own place? I don't make that much money. - You're a porn star. What are you doing with this fucking guy? - I don't know. I mean.. He takes care of me and... he makes my videos. - I'll take care of you. - Yeah? - Yeah. And I'm gonna kidnap you tonight. No, you're not. - Yeah, I am. - No, I can't. - I'm gonna kidnap you. - No, you're not. Just don't. - Nice ride. You must be Jagger. - Yeah. Theo told me to hurry up. Good thing this Viper's fast. Hop in. Now get down on your knees and suck my big cock. - What the fuck are you guys doing? - Take off your clothes or I'll cut you, too. - What are you guys doing? I wanna play. - Expanding the site. - Blowin' up, baby. - Cool. - Guess whose videos are by far the most viewed? - Who's daddy's little star? Sorry, I mean, big fucking star. - I'm not as big of a star as Brent. - Who? - Brent Corrigan. What, have you been living under a porn rock? - Harlow you'll be so much bigger than that fucking twink. You wanna know a thing about twinks? With a twink, you blink, and they're a fucking twunk. Okay? Washed up. You? You're a fucking man. You got everything, baby. Fucking twink. - Yeah, fuck that twink. - Fuck that twink. - Fuck that twink. - Are you fucking the new assistant? - What? Oh, God, no. - Alright. Just checking. - Baby, it is so hot that you'd rather kill me than let someone else have me. - Will you prove to me how much you like it? Yeah. Fuck, yeah. - Yeah. Oh, you like that? - Fuck, yeah. Fuck that ass! Fuck that asshole! - You like that big dick? - Fuck, yeah. Fuck yes! - You fucking like that? - Give me that dick! Big dick's mine! Fuck! Did a little shopping today. Ain't she a beauty? - Uh.. You already have a silver convertible. - This is a Maserati. Oh, yes! Love it! Hm. Hm. - We need to talk. - About what? - How much I make. - That sounds fair. - Hm. - You've been working very, very hard. Why don't we bump you up to $1500 for the next video? - Ten thousand. - Pardon me? - Ten thousand. - Where is this coming from? - You make a lot of money off these videos and it's 'cause of me. - Oh. It's because of us. I produce, direct, cast, edit. There's a lot of overhead that goes into this business. There's distribution, there's, there's taking care of you. Two thousand for the next video, and that's absolutely final. - I don't think that's fair. - You don't know what I make. - You just bought a fucking Maserati, Stephen. Do you think I'm an idiot? - Oh. I see what this is. You think I only spoil myself. Well... get ready to feel like a real idiot for bringing this up today. Happy birthday. - Hm. - Twenty five hundred for the next video and I suggest you take it because according to the contract that you signed I don't have to give you a raise until we make five more videos. Read before you sign, darling. You know what? I'm only gonna give it to you under one condition. - What condition? - You have to tell me that I fucked you better than your little boy-toy, Mikey. - Oh, Jesus. - Say it. Say I fucked you better than he did. - You fucked me better than he did. Happy? - Thank you. There's a good boy. Keep things nice and clean. I have to go out and run some errands. Do not go outside, okay? The neighbors gossip enough. - Leave the money on the dresser and come get comfortable. - That's a good start. - Cut. Cut. - What.. - I'm sorry. Can we, can we just cut? - Okay, cut. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, I just need a second. - Harlow? Just take five. - Yeah. - What's this? Where are you going? - Home. - Hey, what's wrong, baby? - Nothing. - No, don't do that. Tell me. - Nothing. - Tell me. What's wrong? Just tell me. What's wrong? What's wrong? Huh? What's wrong? - It -- It's just that he.. ...he reminded me of him. - Oh. - The way he look -- looked at me the way, the way he touched me when I was younger. I.. - You know, you have to come back, right? You signed a contract. - Fuck your contract. - Excuse me? - I'm not your fucking property. - Alright, fine! Get out of here. Go back to your mother and your shit job. You'll come crawling back! - You think I can't get my own work? I have a name. - No! You are Sean Nobody. I created Brent. I'm the one who made the investments. I'm not losing you to anybody. - Fuck you! - You walk out that door I'll tell your mother exactly what you've been doing. I'll tell her that you're a whore! Sean. Sean. Please, listen, please. I'm sorry! - It's fine. Listen to me. Your stepdad is never gonna hurt you again. I'm here now, okay? No one no one is ever gonna do that to you again. Okay? Just you and me. Just you and me. - Fuck. My Viper. - Do it. Hey. - What the fuck are you doing? - Let it go. - This is my fucking car! - Hey, hey, hey. - What? - Hold it back. Hold it back! - Look, next is pepper spray and after that is the police. You're gonna pepper spray me? - Don't make me. - In my own fucking driveway? - Just doin' our job, man. Just doin' our job. You gotta let it go. It's hooked up, alright? Thank you. Yeah. - Let's get the fuck out of here. - Check again. If not, we're pulling. - Goddamn it. Fuck! - I don't understand what even happened. Are they really gonna take my car? It's my fucking baby. Look, we're just, just a little behind on the bills, that's all. Whoa, wait, what do you mean we're behind on the bills? We make a lot of money, Joe. What are you talking -- I don't, I don't wanna change our lifestyle, alright? I want you to be happy. - I don't care about our fucking lifestyle. If we can't pay the fucking bills, I won't be happy. We're gonna be fine. We're fine. We're gonna be fine. We'll be fine. - How much do we owe? How much do we owe?

We're gonna get through this. - Mom, I told you I would get the heavy ones. - Do not treat me like an old woman. - You are an old woman. - What? - Yup. - I don't see it, Mr. Muscle man here. What's this, scrawny arms? - Okay. - You ever heard of a gym? - Mom! - What? You started it. - I'm so glad you're back. - Me, too. Mm, look at this place, huh? My first apartment was a shit hole. - It's not that nice. - It's got charm, though, and it's not my couch though that will always be available to you. - Thanks, but no thanks. - I am so proud of you. Eighteen and already on your own but you got rent to pay, so get a job. - I told you. I know producers here. I can get a PA job in, like, a second. - What's a PA job? - It's like an assistant. - It doesn't sound very promising. - I'll be fine. I promise. - Okay. You look pretty today. Yeah. - Thank you. - Ah, Mr. Corrigan. - Hi. - Ah, good to see you. Good to see you. - Hey, you as well. - Go ahead. Go get fluffed. Have a seat. Awesome. I'm a real, big fan of yours. - Thank you. I'm a fan of your work as well. - So you want to play with the big boys now, eh? - Yeah. - Yeah? Well, we want to start playing with you. Uh, in fact, we can start as, as early as next week but, uh... Cobra.. - Yeah, I don't work for them anymore. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Huh, 'cause that Stephen guy seemed to think that he still had you under contract as Brent Corrigan. - Oh, well then, I mean, that works out great 'cause legally my name isn't Brent. - Actually, no, that's a problem, because the performer that we wanna work with is Brent Corrigan and not a newcomer. I mean, hey, if you want to change your name and then and start all over again, that's fine as a newcomer but you know, I have a lot of newcomers but the deal that we wanted with you is only available to Brent. I'm sorry, man, but keep in touch. - Very nice. Oh, that's good. That is good. Don't be shy. Take those shorts off. Let's get comfortable. Okay, now put your hand behind your head. Yeah, that's good. You are gonna be a big star. I have a feeling. Pardon me. Oh. Brent! So nice to hear from you. - What the fuck is going on? You can't stop me from using my name. - I already have because it's my name. I trademarked it. - What? - Throw that name around all you want. My lawyers will shut you down every time. Brent Corrigan is synonymous with Cobra. You leaving fucked me! - Yeah, but if I stayed I would have been fucking myself. - Oh, Brent Fucks Himself. Good title for a video. Shall we collaborate? - I was 17 when we met. - What? - I was underage for those first Cobra videos. - That's bullshit. I -- I have a copy of your ID. - Yeah, well, check it again. It's fake. If you, if you don't give me my name back I'll tell everybody you made kiddie porn. - Wait. Listen. We both know that you would never do that. The news would ruin you just as much as it would me. - Yeah, it might ruin my career but it'll ruin your life. I'd rather watch you go down than ever make porn again. - Sean, you're the one who lied. So give it your best shot, you little shit. Listen, you don't understand. They're, they're, they're taking all of my stuff. They're taking my computer. You know, these are my personal things. This is private, private stuff. - Sir, I need you to step outside. - I'm in the middle of.. Okay, fine. Fine. I'll call you back. - Like, just, like, please don't tell my mom. Handle with care.. Fuck. - Mr. Corrigan. I was so looking forward to work with you. I spoke to my investor and it's not gonna happen. - Why? I mean, I'm -- I'm 18 now. - Oh, you kind of made the industry look a little bad with the whole underage thing. People are pissed at you, you know? I'm not. I think what you did was fucking hot but it's a no-go. - Stephen. Pedophile. - What? - Pedophile. - Traci Lords. She bounced back after her underage scandal. Alright? Just give it time. Give it time. Lorenzo! - So what's gonna happen? Are you gonna go to jail? - No. - No? - No. I'm not going to jail. No, I have proof that he lied, okay? He's, he's the little shit who should be going to jail. - He's a kid. - Ah! I can't believe it! - Can you at least appreciate that I'm telling you myself? I would have found out anyway. How? Do you watch gay porn? - Sean! Oh, my God, I can't believe I fell for this paid internship bullshit. Who the hell gets paid to be an intern? - I'm sorry. - What about that parental release I signed? - I -- I faked it. - Oh, my God. The lies. - I'm sorry. - I just, I don't understand. You're, you're so talented. What happened to you? And how did you get involved with pornography? - There's no way that you could understand. You live in this safe, little bubble with your little family -- You're family. You're family. - Everybody has stuff, okay? Everybody. So don't judge me, alright? I don't judge you. Please, don't judge me. - Sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I'll say it a million more times. I'm sorry. - That won't do anything. Oh, my God, you were doing porn! I thought you were learning a trade a dream of yours, and instead, you were just being a whore. What is wrong with you, baby? Since when did I raise somebody to disrespect their body? - It's not like that. It -- It was just a way to get out of here. - There are other ways out. You could have taken another route. - Maybe, maybe this is what I wanted. - Why? - Maybe I like it. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Mom, mommy, I'm sorry. - Don't pull that Goody Two-Shoes bullshit on me. I'm not a fucking idiot. - Joe, this is Sean Lockhart. I got your e-mail. Let's meet. Sushi Ota? It's on Mission Drive. I can meet you there tomorrow night at 8:00. - Joe, after we make all this money from Brent do you think I could get my Viper back? - Fuck, yes. - Yes. - I'm gonna get you that Viper back. I'm gonna get you another Viper on top of that. - Fuck, yeah. - Hey. There he is. - Hm. - Hi. - Hey. - It's nice to meet you. - You, too. - Hey. You look great. - Thanks. You look really nice, too. - Very good to meet you, Sean. Alright. Finally. Have a seat. - So you like this place? - Yeah, it's really nice. - Yeah. - Yeah, this place is really cool, right? - Yeah, I really like it. - Cool. - Have you seen any of our Viper-Boyz videos? - Uh, yeah. No, they're cool. Can I get you some early drink? Yeah. - Um, yes, will you have the most expensive bottle of Sake? - I have a great bottle of -- - Get me just the most expensive bottle, okay? The most expensive. Thank you. Have, have you, uh, have you seen all of our product.. He produced all of them. It was me. Yeah. - Alright, listen. - Yeah. No, it's -- - We can, we can chitchat all night but I just want to get down to the point, alright? I'm willing to give you $25,000 for one video. Now, I know that sounds like a lot but you gotta spend money to make money. And I believe a video with Harlow and Brent is gonna make a shitload of money. - Yeah, it will make so much money. And people really want to, they'll want to see us fuck. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Harlow. Man, that's a great porn name. Thank you. It's my real name. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, I've, I've escorted under so many different names um, that I just lost count. I feel like with porn, I just wanna be myself. You know? - Yeah. - Finding myself in it. - You're not afraid of your family finding out? - Yeah. No, Joe is my family. - Yeah. I mean, I don't know, I would be a little bit bummed out if your parents found out. A little bit 'cause they're so cute. They're so sweet. They are, um.. They don't really watch. They would never watch porn. They're fundamentalist, they're fundamentalist Christians, so.. - That's the worst. - Careful. I used to be one. - Hm. Joe used to be a youth pastor. - What? - In a different life. A long time ago. - Okay. We met in this chat room. He was teaching me how to dance-- - Harlow, come on.

Hey, you did a good job. Good job. Good job, Harlow. - New developments tonight concerning a deadly fire. It is now a murder investigation. Police say the man who lived in this home had been stabbed his throat slashed, and last night's fire was an attempt to cover up the crime. We also know that the victim was involved with pornography. At this point we do not have a specific motive uh, but we are definitely interested in his pornography business and you know, people who may have been involved with him. - I got the DA on the line for you. - You have to understand how this story sounds to an outsider. Without Stephen in the picture, you're free from his contract. - I know.. ...but I had nothing to do with this. I swear. Why would I bring myself in here if I did? Do you have any proof at all that Joe and Harlow did this? - Other than the call and.. - Listen, Sean, but we need to place them in the house and we need to know that you didn't ask them to go there. - There he is. - Hey. - Welcome to our abode. - Cool. Come on, Harlow made snacks. - Great. Great place. - Come on in. - Hey, Sean. - Hey. Thank you so much for coming. - Yeah. - So, um, are you hungry? - No, thanks. I ate before -- - I made a cheese plate for you. We have double-cream Brie and jack cheese, pepper jack cheese 'cause I read that you like pepper jack cheese. Um.. We have smoked Gouda from Portugal. Uh, I sliced some pomegranates in there. They're just for show. I wanted to kind of emulate, you know pulled from the bones of vintage cheesemakers. So, um.. Here, just try, try a little bit. Please, please, please, for me, for me. I worked all day. Come on. Okay. - Uh, okay. - I'm, like, addicted to that shit. - It's good. - It's good, right? - Yeah. - Let's do the champagne. - Okay. - To celebrate, right? We're definitely celebrating. We celebrate all the time but we pull out the really good stuff for you. Oh. - Alright. - So, Sean, I've been writing a script. I can't wait for you to read it. I know you're gonna love it. - It's great. - It's, it's about.. So we have all these really fast cars.

Um.. - Why? - Can we just, y -- you know talk about the elephant in the room? - What elephant? - Stephen. - Uh, What about him? He's gone. - I know. Why? - Maybe he pissed off the wrong person. Uh, we -- we were just about to come to an agreement. - About this? - Yeah. - No. There's no way. No way. He wasn't gonna fucking budge. - Please, just tell me what happened. - Do you want to talk? - Yes. - Alright. Let's talk. - Haven't you guys seen anything online? You know, people think I'm behind it. - But it's good now. We'll make the movie and be rich. Yeah, if you didn't do it, then people will know soon enough. - What do you mean if I didn't do it? You know I didn't do it. - Do I? We'll know you didn't do it as soon as we shoot our movie. - When you said you'd fix things I didn't know this is what you meant. - Please. It's exactly what you fucking wanted. - Yeah, I mean, besides it's too late. It was quick. He never saw it comin'. You know, it's sick, but seeing that fucker go down.. Made me feel so good inside, like I got revenge. - Revenge on who? - My stepdad. I never told anybody that he used to rape me. I didn't want to bring shame to my family. When I finally got the courage to tell my family that I was gay.. ...he calls me a fag and he convinces my mom to kick me out of the house. Anyway, let's not, let's not talk about that shit. Come on, we're celebrating. I don't care about that shit. Two tears in the bucket.
