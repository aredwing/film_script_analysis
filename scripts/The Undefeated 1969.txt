Charlotte, I'd like to talk|to you tonight after supper! After it's dark, you mean? All you want to do is hold me|and hug me and kiss my lips! Is there somethin'|wrong with that? Well, a young lady's lookin'|for a mite more these days!!! than huggin' and holdin'|and kissin'! She's lookin' for somethin'|a teensy bit more substantial!!! than periphery and trimmings! Like what, Charlotte? I've said all I'm gonna say,|Bubba Wilkes! Well? Will you walk out|with me after supper? Walk out? Walk out in these|dreadful swamps where-- where I could get eaten|by a tiger or somethin'? Oh, you must've lost your|foolish mind, Bubba Wilkes! And it just goes to prove you don't have|any true regard for me whatsoever! A tiger? [ Horses Neighing ] The first good grass|you come to, give 'em a rest! - All right,John Henry!|- We'll be back around sundown! Hyah! See'd your dust all day!|What you drivin'? Buffalo? Stage arrived yet? It's overdue! I ain't askin'|'cause I don't care! But if your name's Thomas,|there's a couple of popinjays|waitin' inside to see you! They've been here|for two days now! I give 'em water the first day,|and they tooken root! - Government agents?|- I ain't asked! They ain't said! Are you the gentlemen|that were looking for me? You are|MonsieurJohn Henry Thomas? You have me at a disadvantage! I am Monsieur Pierre Petain! This is my companion,|Seor Luis Escodero! We have the honor to represent|the emperor Maximilian of Mexico! Oh! Won't you have a chair,|Monsieur Thomas? Well, thank you, no!|We're waiting for the stage-- We understand|you have many horses! - Is that correct, Mr! Thomas?|- It could be! We have been authorized by the emperor|to purchase all you can supply! Well, I'm afraid you gentlemen|have made a long trip for nothing! My horses are going|to the United States Army! But, Mr! Thomas, we'll buy|the whole herd, sight unseen! Top dollar, if you|drive them to Mexico! - All expenses paid!|- Stagecoach is comin'! I'm sorry, gentlemen!|Our army needs them! Pardon me! Whoa! Pedro Flats! - Mr! Thomas?|- That's right! My name is D!J! Giles, and this|is my associate, Mr! Ezra Parker! - Howdy! This is Short Grub!|- We're out of the U!S! Army|purchasing office at Fort Clark, and we understand you have|some horses to show us! No, I have some horses|to sell you! Three thousand, to be exact, and it's|the best herd you'll find anywhere! Fine! Shall we go inside?|Thank you! We'll cull your herd|tomorrow, Mr! Thomas, as soon as our wranglers|arrive from Brackettville! I suppose that out of 3,000 head,|we ought to able to find 500 or so|that we can use! - Our usual procedure is this--|-Just rein up a minute, Mr! Giles! You're goin' a little fast for me!|Do you mind trottin' through that again? Not at all! I said|that out of 3,000 head, we might be able to find|500 or so that we can use! You know, animals|that meet our specifications! Well, I have 3,000 for sale,|not 500! Well, surely you don't|expect us to purchase!!! just any old horse|for the United States Army? Well, now there just ain't|''any old horse'' in this whole herd! You'll take 'em all or none! Mr! Thomas, I'm sure|you're aware of the fact!!! that, uh, times are hard! Maybe not as hard as you think! The army's not that hungry|for horse flesh! This country is going through|a period of reconstruction! Money is in short supply!|Hmm? Who can you sell 'em to|if not to us? Monsieur Petain,|hold up a minute there! -Just for the record,|what are you payin'?|- Twenty-five dollars a head! [ Thomas ]|Last month it was 35. [ Chuckles ]|But this month it's $25 a head. Well, these gentlemen have offered|to take the whole barrel, sight unseen! - Is that correct?|- That's correct, Mr! Thomas! - And what's your top offer?|- Thirty-five dollars a head, of course! You just bought yourself a herd!|And you can tell Maximilian!!! he won't find better animals between|Montezuma and the Canadian border! Just a minute! You're selling horses|to Maximilian!!! in preference to your|own country's army? No, I'm selling horses for $3 5|in preference to 25! You two figured to make|$1 0 a head! Are you calling us thieves? Well, Mr! Parker, yes, that's|a pretty accurate description! Wait a minute!|I didn't do anything! You should've! Read that message again,|Sergeant! ''Eighteen rolling units|with men, women and children!!! ''passed through Gladesville,|Texas, 1 0:20 p!m! this date! ''Suspected Confederates!|Probable destination, Mexico! Detain, search and turn back!'' [ Imitating Bird Call ] What do you make of that? It seems I've heard that bird|before, sir, at Missionary Ridge! And if I'm not mistaken,|that's a gray-bellied sapsucker! [ Horse Neighing In Distance ] [ Imitating Bird Call ] [ Imitating Bird Call ] - [ Whistles ]|- [ Whooping ] The river! Come on! [ Man ]|Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [ Indistinct Shouting,|Whooping, Whistling ] [ Whooping Continues ] Get your weapons! Real sorry, Miss Ann!|We didn't plan things this way! Let 'em go, Sergeant! McClarty, Gibbs!|Turn 'em loose! Let 'em go! Giddap! Hyah! [ Indistinct Shouting ] [ Cheering, Whooping ] - Sir, I don't mean to--|- I know, Sergeant! But if I can't have the whole dog,|I don't want the tail! Yes, sir! [ Horses Neighing ] We'll probably cross 'em|at the old monastery, Eagle Pass! Bon. Well, if we do not|see each other again, then we will rendezvous|on the plain at Durango! - Bon courage, Monsieur.|- Thank you! They are fine-looking|animals, Mr! Thomas! - The emperor will be pleased!|- I hope he is! But whether he is|or whether he isn't, you have the money there|when the horses arrive! [ Agreeing In French ] What's troubling you? Cavalry's comin' from Fort Clark! Damn government agents! Can they stop us? Not if we get across|that river, they can't! Let's take 'em to Mexico! Let's go! [ Horses Neighing ] Well, what are you waitin' for?|Stop 'em! Stop 'em! We'll be mighty proud to stop 'em,|Mr! Giles-- all 1 2 of us-- just as soon as you tell us|how to go about it! Next! Mr! McCartney, when|are we gonna have some meat? Right now, if you want it! Belly cheater! High Bred, you know|what good food is, don't you? You mangy old cat! - Hey, McCartney!|- Mister McCartney! There's somethin' crawlin'|in these beans! Well, you can speak to it,|but don't play with it!!! or else the others'll want one|in their beans too! Hold that plate! Yes, sir, I can just feel|that money in my pocket right now! What are you gonna do with it|when you get it? Well, I had to give that|a lot of good thought, but I somehow ain't come to set|right down on the notion yet! [ Man ] I know what I'm gonna buy me--|some pack animals and traps. Whatever's left over,|I'm gonna get drunk! And if I ever sober up again,|I'm headin' for the Rockies! Well, that might be fine|for you, Whitt, but me bein'better bred,|I got higher ambitions. Like what? Like building a small library|under a big elm someplace! Me and High Bred's gonna go to St! Louis|and open up a little cathouse! [ High Bred Meows ] - Everything quiet out there?|- Would you believe it,John Henry? - I had to wake two of the men!|- Let's hope it stays that way! You ain't expectin' trouble,|are you,John Henry? Trouble? Well, let's see! We got Maximilian on one hand!!! and Juarez on the other|and bandits in between! On top of that,|we're Americans in Mexico!!! taking a cavy ofhorses|to a very unpopular government. Why should we expect trouble? How come you didn't|tell us that aforehand? How come you didn't ask me? John Henry, there's a box canyon|about four miles from here! - Enough forage to fill 'em?|- No, sir, but|there's enough to hold 'em! There's somethin' else!|I rode across two trails! One was wagons and horses!|The second trail was many riders-- at least 40 and maybe 60. The second trail ran|just down the side of the first! Well, if you were to tell me|that a year ago!!! in Virginia or Tennessee,|I'd suspect ambush! It looked that way to me! - Short Grub!|- Yo! There's forage and water about|four miles ahead in a box canyon! Move 'em in there and|hold 'em till we get back! Where are you going,John Henry? I don't believe it! Pick up that bucket! Well, howdy, Sergeant Newby! Save your ''howdy''|for later,Jamison! Right now let me see you|start currying that horse! - Yes, sir!|-Just like old times, eh, Newby? Just like old times,|Colonel! Riders approachin' Two riders a-comin'! Margaret! We have company! Good afternoon!|My name's Thomas! We're drivin' a herd|of horses south, just over the hill! I'm ColonelJames Langdon!|Mr! Thomas, what can I do for you? Well, it isn't|what you can do for us! We came to warn you that you're|probably riding into a bandit ambush! Well, how do you|happen to know that? Well, Blue Boy here|is a full-blooded Cherokee! When he suspects somethin',|you usually get it. There's 40 to 60 riders|moving parallel to you, just out of sight. Waitin' until we get|into those hills? That'd be my guess! - What did you say your name was?|-John Henry Thomas! Don't I know you|from somewhere? To my knowledge, Colonel,|we've never met before! [ Sighs ] Well, we appreciate|the warning, sir! It's late! Will you and your friend|join us for supper, stay the night? Best offer we've had all day! [ Bugle Call ] There's nothin'|like a full stomach!!! for facin' the unknown future! Well, I hate to be|persistent, Colonel, but, uh, I think|the future is pretty certain! I fully agree! I think they'll give you|a couple of days to get up into|the hills before they strike! If this was my outfit, I'd hold|right here and make them come to me. [ Langdon ]|That's good thinkin' I've never yet let the enemy choose|the sight ofhis own destruction. - I like to play in my yard!|- What are these bandits after? Gold, horses!!! women! We had an experience or two|with 'em before the... war. Were you, perchance,|in the war, Mr! Thomas? Yes, Captain, I was! Would it be brash and|presumptuous of me to ask!!! which side you were on,|Mr! Thomas? Well, I favor to think that|I was on the right side, Mrs! Langdon! I detect a shadow of animosity|towards my question! Could it be that you|were a Yankee soldier? What a question to ask a man! Yes, ma'am,|I was a Yankee soldier! Mr! Thomas!!! I'm about to make my rounds|before I turn in tonight! Would you care to accompany me? Thank you, sir! [ Horse Neighing ] I suspected it when I saw those|Union trousers on that Indian boy! My son was killed by Union cavalry|at Shiloh, Mr! Thomas! We called it|Pittsburgh Landing! - You were there then?|- I was! May I ask your rank? I was a colonel|in that cavalry! John Henry Thomas!|Of course! Well, you were on|George Custer's right flank!!! when you charged the breastworks|at Madisonville, weren't you? - We did a job that day, didn't we?|- You were damn cruel! Cruel? ThoseJohnny Rebs had 40-pounders|looking right down our throats! Did you think you|were comin' to a ball? Sergeant! Yes, sir! If I can find the time,|I'm gonna sit down and write|the social history of bourbon! Tell me somethin',|Mr! Thomas! Were you, by chance,|at Chickamauga? I ask because I lost|my brother there-- Ann's husband! I lost 23 in my command|at Chickamauga-- friends and sons of friends, men that I'd known|all their lives! - Now can I ask you a question, Colonel?|- Fire one, Mr! Thomas! Why did you come clear out here|to continue a war that ended|months ago in Virginia? Because I'm a stubborn man!|Does that satisfy you? No! I got no taste for losin'|to a lot of Yankee rabble! - How about that?|- It won't wash! You can be a very|aggravatin' man, Mr! Thomas! - Sergeant!|- Yes, sir! Let's just say|we haven't seen the end! You'll see it quick enough|if you keep drinkin' this stuff! Excuse me, Colonel! Sergeant! Help yourself! [ Man Shouting ] [ Little George ]|The young 'uns, now. Come on over here. You get over here|with me right now! Hurry, now!|Get tucked away! Come on! - Come on, now.|- Mind a suggestion from|a Platte River Indian fighter? Why don't you arm your women?|That's what we did on the|Bozeman and California trail! [ Wilkes ]|Colonel! [ Langdon ]|All our night pickets come in yet? All butJamison, sir! - Well, go get him!|- Carlyle! Little George! It's Jamison, sir! - All right!|- Take him down, George! Captain, issue a rifle|to every woman knows how to use it! Yes, sir!|Carry on, Sergeant! Ladies! Colonel! - Looks like he wants to talk!|- We have nothing to talk about! - Well, he's got you outnumbered!|Let's start from there!|- Finding ourselves outnumbered, Colonel Thomas, is a fact of life|we've gotten used to! With women and children|in the pot? - I'll go, sir!|- No! The colonel and I will go! Let's understand|each other, Thomas! Your Indian friend rode out of here|last night with no explanation! He hasn't returned! One false move|on your part, and my men won't miss! Friend, your men have been|missin' me for years! As far as that Indian boy is concerned,|his father was Bold Eagle, one of the bravest warriors|that ever rode a horse. And on top of that,|he's my adopted son, and I haven't done this much|explaining in years. - Don't press me, Captain!|- Anderson! Yes, sir! Windage and elevation,|Mrs! Langdon! Windage and elevation! Buenos das, seores.|Yo soy Escalante. - Do you speak English?|-Ah, s. I speak English|most excellently! - Then tell us what you want|and be damned quick about it!|- We want everything! We're so poor,|and we need so much! I'm gonna ask you one more time!|What do you want? We want your wagons, your horses,|your guns and your gold! And you also|have some women, seor. - Is this fool serious?|- You can bet your life on it! - But it's preposterous!|- Yeah! - I have more ''mens'' than you!|- If you wanna lose most of'em,|you come right on ahead! Otherwise, you'd better hightail|your ass right on out of here! - I'll fight a thousand of you|before I give you a penny!|- I was hoping you'd say that! Is the flap on your holster snapped|or unsnapped, my Confederate friend? Snapped, my Yankee friend! Well, I guess I'm his pigeon! Hold your fire!|Hold your fire! [ Men Shouting, Indistinct ] Colonel! You went out there to talk!|Why did you have to shoot the man? The conversation|kind of dried up, ma'am! [ Indistinct Shouting, Whooping ] - Fire!|- [ Gunfire ] [ Horse Whinnies ] [ Man Shouts ] Just like old times,|huh, Colonel? - [ Crying ]|- Margaret! - Margaret!|- [ Sobbing ] I can't! - [ Gunfire Continues ]|- [ Horse Whinnies ] [ Whinnying Continues ] Colonel, behind you! [ Gunfire Tails Off] - Don't tell me they're leavin'!|- No, ma'am! They're reforming to charge again!|Leastwise, that's their plan! [ Gunfire ] [ Horse Whinnies ] -[ Gunfire Continues ]|- I'll be damned! [ Battle Cries ] [ Horses Whinnying ] They're leavin' now, ma'am!|That's Blue Boy's little surprise! Well, I'll be damned! Mrs! Langdon, the colonel--|your brother-in-law-- said you lost your husband|during the war! - Yes, Mrs! Thomas!|- I'm sorry! You didn't know him!|Why should you be sorry? My cavalry was|in that engagement! Colonel Thomas,|I wanna thank you! No thanks are necessary! They were|our enemies as much as they were yours! - Their own people shoot 'em on sight!|- We're in your debt! Colonel, why don't you take|all these people and go on home? There's no tellin' what you're|gonna run into farther south! In a day or two, we make contact with a|military escort from Emperor Maximilian! We are going home!|It's ahead of us! All right, Colonel! [ Short Grub ] Who you wavin'at,|Blue Boy? [ Laughs ] [ Cowboy ]|Hyah, hyah! [ Shouts Continue ] - Wanna tell me all about it?|- I was thinkin' about that girl! - What girl?|- The Confederate colonel's|daughter, Charlotte! - She's a pretty girl!|A little young, but pretty!|- I want her! - You want her?|- And she wants me! - How'd you figure that out?|- You raised me to know,John Henry! I taught you what to do when the snow|comes, how to survive in a blizzard, and I taught you how to deal|with men, but women-- Nobody knows|what's on a woman's mind! Well, she wants me, and when|we go home, she'll be with me! [ Man Shouting, Indistinct ] Anything wrong,John Henry? Not yet! [ Cowboy ]|Yah,yah,yah,yah. McCartney,|give me a cup of coffee! Never mind!|I got his coffee! This damn cinch is|pretty near cut in half! [ Hoofbeats Approaching ] Man's coming,John Henry! From Colonel Langdon, sir!|I'm to wait for an answer! We're in a new camp waiting|for an escort from Maximilian! There's a map on the other side!|What's the matter? Ain't you Yanks|ever seen a live one before? Last time I seen a pretty|gray uniform like that, it was all full of holes! - Do you know what's in this, Sergeant?|- Of course I know! There must've been a few words|in that camp before the colonel|sat down and wrote this out! Yes, sir! A lot of words!|I thought Captain Anderson|was gonna have apoplexy! And how about you personally,|Sergeant! What do you think about it?
