(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) It's me! Roman. Jesus. I thought you were Ryan. (GRUNTS) Here. Do you know where Ryan is? He's getting in on the 1 0:30 ferry. Wants you to pick him up. He caIIed. I guess you were busy. Got it. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (MAN PLAYING SAXOPHONE) Oh, baby. What's aII this? Come on, I'II drive. Come here. WeII, just the fact that Jim gave me the case. I mean, there are five other guys he couId've given it to, but he handed it to me. Hi, baby. Miranda is insaneIy jeaIous. Yes. What's in your pocket? You haven't Iistened to a word I've said, have you? Yeah, five guys, Miranda's insaneIy jeaIous. What's in the pocket? Open it. It's your mother's oId siIver chain. Ryan, it's beautifuI. That's paper inside. Paper? Paper for... Our first anniversary. Oh, my God, it's tonight. (STUTTERING) I don't even know what to say. Don't worry. You've been so busy. No, pIease, don't make excuses for me. I wiII make this up to you. ReaIIy? You promise? What's on the paper? My Iove for you. SeaIed forever. It's pretty dark out there, huh? Oh, my God. I Iove it. I Iove you. (LOUD BANG) You're weIcome. Thanks for teIIing me. He made me promise. Sneak. You do everything your big brother teIIs you? Yeah, right. If I Iistened to him, I wouIdn't be such a fuckup, and you two never wouId've met. Can't fauIt you on that one. AII right. I'm gonna get out of your hair. RYAN: No, no, no rush. I gotta go change anyway. Thanks, big man. It reaIIy Iooks beautifuI. I'm sorry about earIier. PIease don't smoke in the house. Roman. You want one? No. You know I promised Ryan. Is that paper? It's cute. (MUSIC PLAYING) (MAN SINGING) You know I can't save you You're on your own No, I just can't... (MUSIC STOPS PLAYING) (GRUNTING) Things get too busy on the couch to caII? I was doing something for my brother. Oh, yeah? Am I ever gonna meet this brother of yours? That's not IikeIy. Thornton Wilder wrote, "There's a Iand of the Iiving, "and a Iand of the dead and the bridge is Iove, "the onIy survivaI, and the onIy meaning." My mom wouId've Ioved you. WeII, of course. You said she had good taste. You know, you can't ever Ieave me, no matter how bad a wife I am. You're a perfect wife. Liar. You know, we wanted to be pregnant by now. I can't take that kind of time off work right now. Besides, we need my income. That's not an issue. Come on. I don't know if I'm ready. What if we Iose us? Jess, you wiII never Iose me. So what was it Iike in prison? Sex isn't aII it's cracked up to be. If you couId start your Iife over, what wouId you do different? I'd be someone eIse. That's sad, Roman. Anyone can change. Change is choice, you know? "Change is choice"? Where'd you read that? Just made it up. So, when wiII I see you again? Hard to say. You're not gonna do anything stupid, are you? See? Right there. That's what it's Iike being me. Everyone aIways thinks I'm up to something. I wonder why. (DOOR OPENING) You're sexy when you work. Norman. Hang on, hang on. Lucky coin. (COOKER WHISTLING) Damn it. (DOOR CLOSING) You know, no one ever died from taking a day off. It broke. I don't know what happened. Oh, that's okay. I'II fix it. UnIess you forget where you put it. Oh, don't you worry, I'II find a perfectIy safe pIace for it. (RATTLING) (BURPS) We're out of juice. (NORMAN GROWLING) Norman. Come on. When are we getting our house back? Jess, come on. I'm serious. Look, I feeI bad enough about what my dad did aIready. Everybody's aIways giving Roman a raw deaI. I mean, he's my brother. I'm not gonna do that. I didn't mean it Iike that. I just... I know you don't see it, but he scares me, and I don't trust him. Remember, I'm the one that caught him snooping in our bedroom. Come on, Jess. He's not a bad person. I pIed his case. I know exactIy how bad he is. JESS: I can't do this for another 1 8 months. We need to get him into a haIfway house. RYAN: AII right. As soon as we find a pIace, he's out of here. (CLATTERING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) HeIIo? Hey. I think Roman's puIIing some kind of stunt. What're you taIking about? WeII, he just tore out of here in his car, and he took aII of his stuff with him. Ryan, you know he's not aIIowed to Ieave the state. AII right, I'm coming back. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (GASPS) (BRAKES SQUEALING) (CRASHING) DR. RAJAN: They both suffered totaI cardiac arrest. Paramedics revived them on the way in, but there are no signs of cognitive response from either one. We are assessing to see how... Which one is my husband? Can he hear me? It's possibIe. We reaIIy can't teII at this stage. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Do you want a chair? No, I'm not gonna stay Iong. Not sure he'd want me to. I'm sure he appreciates it. Anything happens, you'II Iet me know? Either way? Of course. You're sweet. Just Iike he said. DR. RAJAN: Mrs. Bryson? Can we speak for a moment? We can keep your husband on the machines, so Iong as there's Iower brain function. And we wiII keep monitoring, but it's been three weeks now. What are you saying? The chances of him waking are very smaII. Like what? There's no way of teIIing. It couId be months, it couId be years, if he wakes at aII. I'm very sorry. (NORMAN BARKING) (DOORBELL RINGING) JESS: I miss you so much. I miss hearing your voice. l dream about it, and then I wake up, and can't remember what you sound Iike. We got about a 50-50 chance of this thing working out. WouId you Iook at that? What? What am I Iooking at? Jess? You know, if you're not ready for this... No, I'm... I am. Just give me a minute? Okay. (MACHINE BEEPING RAPIDLY) (RETCHING) (BREATHING HARD) (MACHINE BEEPING RHYTHMICALLY) Mr. Bryson, are you aII right? Can you hear me? He's on secanoI, making him very disoriented. But they said he was asking for you. DR. RAJAN: Any probIems with your vision? No. Your hearing? There's a buzzing in my ears. I'm coId. I can't seem to get warm. TeII me something about yourseIf, something you remember. My wedding. DR. RAJAN: So you're married? I don't see a ring on your finger. Jess. I don't know what this is. What happened? PIease. Mr. Bryson, pIease. I'm sorry... Jess, it's me. There's nothing physicaI to expIain the disorientation and memory Ioss. It shouId aII come back to him rather quickIy. The fact that he woke up, does that mean my husband couId do the same thing? They sustained very different injuries. I'm afraid your husband's condition has not changed. NURSE: He's stiII in shock. The HaIoperidoI shouId keep his deIusions to a minimum. But he's been awake in a strange environment for three weeks. What he reaIIy needs right now is the famiIiarity of his own home. His home? CIearview Street? That's where he was before the accident? You're his cIosest Iiving reIative. You'II have to take him home. Hi. Let's go. Hey, Norman. Come here. Hey, Norman. Hey, what's up, boy? Norman, stop it! In here. You aII right? I'm fine. (CHATTERING ON TV) PRIEST: Thornton WiIder wrote, "There's a land of the Iiving, "and a Iand of the dead and the bridge is Iove, "the onIy survivaI, and the onIy meaning." I Iove this part. Jess. No. Don't. Don't say my name Iike that. What do you want from me? I'm scared. I don't know what's happening and... Come with me. This is your bed, okay? These are your things. This is your Iife, and I am not part of it. Jess, pIease Iisten. No, don't touch me. Something happened to me in that accident. Look, I don't bIame you for what happened to Ryan, okay? PIease. I just want you to get better. And move on. MIRANDA: I wouId just kick him out. I can't do that, Miranda. Why not? The guy's done time for assauIt, aIong with God knows what eIse. Look, he's dangerous. You, of aII peopIe, shouId know that. Ryan wouIdn't want me to. Sorry. I didn't mean... No, it's okay. I know you're right. Look, babe. AII I'm saying is you have to do something. You can't Iive Iike this. Right? Thanks for doing this. It'II be good for him to see you. How's he doing? He's not reaIIy himseIf yet. No shit. You Ieft it at my pIace. Figured you'd want it back. Oh, you must be a friend of Roman's. Look, I knew you'd stiII be pissed. (STUTTERING) I'm sorry. I reaIIy don't know you. What, Iike, at aII? I'm sorry. Want one? I don't smoke. (CELL PHONE RINGS) What the heII are you doing? I want us to taIk. Fine, Roman, taIk. Don't caII me that. I've been trying to figure this out. Trying to remember things. And it's Iike everything's there, but it aII happened Remember the storm in Cancun? The aIabaster hair band you Iost in Maui? We searched the ocean for hours? Remember when we went to Pastis, and the waiter spiIIed a bottIe of BaroIo aII over my white shirt? No. The circus in Kentucky? Why are you doing this? 'Cause I have no choice. These are my memories. Jess... I Iove you. No. No, you don't. You're my wife. Stop it. MIRANDA: I don't know what he's doing, but he's Iying to you. You can't Iet him get to you. What if it's reaI? Jess. No, I mean it. What if I couId have him back? What if I couId do things right this time? He was in an accident. It's not your fauIt. He used to write me Iove Ietters every week. And I never wrote him back. I just Iet them piIe up, Iike IOUs. I had the perfect Iife, and it just didn't matter how many peopIe toId me, I took it for granted. Thought he'd aIways be there. Jess... He's not gone. Sorry, my hands are not working right. I have something for you. I fixed it. Norman. DR. CREANE: You are disappearing. You are becoming nothing. You wiII hear nothing but the sound of my voice. When your heart sIows down, so wiII your thoughts. Five... Four... Three... Two... One. I want you to go back to the day of the accident. Where are you? What can you see? White. Fog. What eIse? I'm driving. (GASPS) ReIax. Go back, go back. Where are you now? Birthday. Whose name is on the cake? Ryan. Are you Ryan? DR. CREANE: Who are you? ROMAN: I'm hurting. Say your name. Roman. I see Roman. Say your name. Give me your name. Give me your one true name. CIear! Give me your reaI name. Jess! Take care of Ryan on his journey. Amen. JESS: I'm so scared, David. I don't want to beIieve this. You can't give up hope, Jessica. You and Ryan have something spectacuIar, a connection most peopIe wiII never know. Who are we to pIace Iimits on what that can accompIish? Jess, you know Ryan better than anyone. I think you're asking a question onIy you can answer. I can't be aIone. (GASPS) Get out! PIease don't send me back in there. I keep getting these headaches. I feeI nauseous. I'm afraid if I Iie back down on that bed, I'm not gonna wake up again. I can't do this. It's too much. Even if... I need you to go away. Roman. PIease. If that's what you want, I'II do it. You ready? Where are we going? You don't remember this pIace? Things we used to do? Look, if you reaIIy don't care about me, then why are you even here? She asked me to taIk to you. Come on, hit me. I know you want to. Come on. She doesn't even Iike you. You scare her. You don't have a chance. I'm not buying it, Roman. I know who you are. Happy anniversary. (CLINKING) When we took this picture, you whispered something to me. There was an oId coupIe in the park and... And when I Iooked at them, I couId onIy think one thing. Our future. Our future. Ryan. Ryan. (GASPS) Hey. What's wrong? Nothing. Just had a bad dream. Everything's perfect. When you were gone, I promised myseIf that if you ever came back, I wouId change. That I'd be a better person. A better wife. I'm back. (ROMAN LAUGHING) Yes? I never reaIized how short you actuaIIy are. Funny, huh? Yeah. (EXCLAIMS) No! No! (GASPING) Are you okay? Baby, what's wrong? I'II be aII right. (PHONE RINGING) DR. RAJAN: He had a seizure. We were abIe to stabiIize him aImost immediateIy, but now his invoIuntary body functions are weakening. His heart is stiII beating, but if his condition deteriorates, there's no way of knowing how he wouId react to another episode Iike this. ROMAN: He's suffering. JESS: That used to be you in there. Maybe in some way, it stiII is. I just think we shouId do what's best for him. We don't know what that is. We have no idea what wiII happen if we turn that machine off. I'm sorry. I can't risk it. I can't Iose you again. (EXCLAIMS) Damn it, fucker. Hey, there, potty mouth. Hey, I didn't hear you come in. Are you happy? I couIdn't be happier. Yeah? Yeah. (CHUCKLING) Casey. Yeah, I was wondering why you never got back to me. Guess this wouId do it. You do this? Yeah. Never did one of me. My brother must've treated you very badIy. I hate you. No matter what you do to me, I can't change the way I feeI about you. Anyone can change. Anyone can change? Change is choice, right, Roman? Right? I feeI badIy for her. This is what matters. This is aII that matters. Casey? (SQUEAKING) (BREATHING HARD) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Baby, I'm so sorry. I've been trying to caII. I've got a fIat tire. Can you wait? He's beautifuI. He? She. I don't know. Doesn't matter. God, I wish I was there. Me, too. I Iove you. I Iove you, too. I'II see you at home. Okay. CongratuIations. Everything seems just fine. Thank you. WeII, I'm not sure I'm the one to thank. How Iong you had this rash on your neck? Are you aIIergic to anything? Not that I know of. I'd say it's your neckIace then. Is it new? Oh, no. Strange. CouId be your body just adjusting to the hormone change. Sometimes women deveIop aIIergies during pregnancy. Is the chain siIver? Cheaper metaIs cause rashes sometimes. Oh, don't worry. Nothing serious. (DOOR OPENING) Hey. That was fun. Remind me never to get a fIat in the rain again. (EXCLAIMS) WeII, what's this? Doesn't even Iook reaI. Hey, you okay? I'm fine. What's wrong? Nothing. It's nothing at aII. AII right. I'm gonna go change. Hey. Ah, here you go. Oh, that's my boy. You're getting fat. I think we're going to put you on Weight Watchers. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) DETECTIVE MILLS: When did you see her Iast? Ms. Bryson? Not for a whiIe. Not for weeks. I'm sorry. So you and Miss Riggs, you were seeing each other? WeII... They were. But not for some time. Not a very happy reIationship, I understand. She was a troubIed girI. If you hear anything... I'm sure they'II find her. Sometimes I can feeI him. I have his hands. His heart. It's Iike he's waiting. He's wanting to come back. When you Iook at me, do you think about him? Sometimes. Lucky coin. Nothing's gone forever. Jess? (CHATTERING ON TV) Hi, baby. Hey, what do you think of Victor? I think, Iess thinking, more unpacking. I Iove it when you boss me around. I'm gonna go take this stuff upstairs. ROMAN: Remember the storm in Cancn? RYAN: It's your mother's oId siIver chain. The circus in Kentucky? These are my memories. MIRANDA: He's Iying to you. Remember when we went to Pastis, and the waiter spiIIed a bottIe of BaroIo aII over my white shirt? Memories. Memories. Memories. There was an oId coupIe in the park and... And when l looked at them, I couId onIy think one thing. Our future. Our future. Our future. You're cute, Iooking at this stuff. I'm sorry. No, you... You just scared me. Are you okay? Yeah. Hormones. Okay. If you're hungry, I'm gonna go fix dinner. Okay. (STUTTERING) I'm just gonna be a minute. Hey, Jess, you need anything? No, I'm fine. (CLINKING) It's a funny thing, isn't it? Love? It's stronger than any of us. It finds a way somehow. And once you get it, you can never Iet it go. That's probabIy why it was so hard for Roman. 'Cause I think he was in Iove with you. And I think he feIt Iike I stoIe you from him. Just because he saw you first. So he stuck it out, watching the two of us, torturing himseIf. Can't say I bIame him. We are so Iucky. I want you to come with me. I think you'II Iike this. It's aImost finished. Like it? What do you think? I guess I'II keep working on it. Do not run away from this. Jess, Iook at me. We've worked too hard to get here. I understand that you are hurt and confused, but the truth is you're happier now than you've ever been. No. No, you Iied to me. How sick are you? You took advantage of me whiIe my husband was dying. No. The onIy way that I couId even stand to be in the same room with you was when you were someone eIse. First Casey, now you. Why do you do this? Why do you aII do this? Why do you turn on me Iike this? What? What did you do? I Iove you. I did it aII for you. We are starting to buiId a famiIy. I came back for you. He didn't. Back for me? Just the thought of you touching me makes me sick. He's Iying. God. (MACHINE BEEPING) (JESS GROANING) Come on, Jess, stand up. Something's wrong. (GASPING) I'm serious. Something's wrong. Let me see. (SHOUTING) You're hurting me! He's dumping his pressure. NURSE: We're down by 25%. Okay, we're Iosing him. I've got an EEG 5, stiII faIIing. (ALL CLAMORING) You knew what you were doing with me! You aIways knew! Stop this. I remember the first time you Iooked at me. I knew what you wanted. You kept Iooking at me Iike that, even when you were with him. (GROANS) (JESS GRUNTING) I wiII not Iet you go. (GROANING) Time of death... (GROANING) DR. RAJAN: Mrs. Bryson? I have good news. The baby wiII be fine. What about Ryan? He had another seizure Iast night. He fought it. He fought hard. For a moment it seemed his body wasn't strong enough. But then, somehow, he puIIed through. I think we're gonna be okay. We'II get through this. And... I've taken a new case. I think it's something I shouId do. But I want you to know... I need you to know that when you find your way back, I wiII be right here. And things wiII be different. I wiII be different. I promise you, baby. RYAN: Let me heIp you. (ON YOUR OWN PLAYING) (MAN SINGING) You know I can't save you You're on your own No, I just can't heIp you You're aII aIone You're on your own On your own You're on your own
