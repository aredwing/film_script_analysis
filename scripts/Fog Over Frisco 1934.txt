Oh, I see, go ahead. - Watch this. There you are. - You did pretty good, Tony, but... ...me! I'll blow this over Telegraph Hill. Izzy, the great world egg blower. Come on, turn it over.

Its ok with me, boys, I dont care how many drinks you mooch of me,... ...but youve been laying down on my space lately. Why dont you kick in with some notices? - Go jump in the lake. - I cant swim. The journals have given you plenty of publicity in... ...the last 2 years, but you ain't so crazy about it! Why, boys, this is a new deal, ain't it? Well, Arlene Bradford, it's good to see you again. - I thought you'd forgotten us. - Well, aint' that Joe,... - ... it's marvellous to be here. - Come this way. Come on, boys, head it up for Arlene. Hello, Arlene. - Thanks, Bill. - That's all right. Gee, Arlene Bradford and Spencer Carlton. I haven't seen her in a night-club since they became engaged. Oh, a perfect set up from here, perfect. Hello, Arlene. Where have you been lately? Hello, dear, it's good to see you. Well, Joe, same old place! Same old place, but your old friends have missed you. - That's encouraging. - Of course we've been glad to hear about... ...your engagement but it's sure been bad for business. - Hello, Arlene. - Hello, Tony. - Tony, this is a pleasant surprise. - Val, what are you doing here? Spencer, you know Tony Sterling. - Of course, how are you? - Hello, Carlton. - Won't you sit down? - Thanks. - Have a cigarette? - Thank you. - Hello, Arlene. - Hello, Dick. - What do we play for you? - Oh, let's have... ..."Why don't I dream those dreams"? All right. You can have anything you want in this place, you know that, don't you? That's a rash promise. Anything you want, Arlene. All this hobnobbing,... - ...that's why I didn't want to come here. - They're just good pals of mine,... Don't crap, darling, don't be a whim! Let's dance. City desk, Gertrude Hello, Joe, this is Archie. They got a hot little squib on Arlene Bradford. Back on the primrose path and acting as mentor to her little sister. Yeah, make it spicy. When did you start running around with Arlene? Please, Charlie, don't think Arlene is a bad influence. Her engagement proved a marvellous thing. She is really a dear. You'd never know Arlene, she's changed entirely. It's about time. Hey, society! Who's the gal dancing with Tony? She's the only real Bradford daughter. Arlene's her stepsister. She must be respectable. I never saw her before. I picked Arlene off the blather for everything. From speeding... ...to being pinched in Chinatown raids. - Oh, that I were young - And old Bradford's got more millions... ...than there were Indians out here when his family landed. I'm sorry to trouble you, Miss Bradford, but your car is blocking... ...in a couple of others in the parking space. May I have your keys to move it? Surely. - Thank you.. - Cheer up, darling. I'm alright. - Did you get your picture? - I'm just getting it now. - How do you like the wine? - Fine! - Vintage 1911, right? - Right, Arlene! Oh, Spence! - Well, let's go. - That suits me. Cheque, please. - But we've only been here a minute. - Well, Spencer doesn't like it here,... ...and besides I have a headache. - All right. - I'm darn sorry you have to hurry away. I might go dancing with you alone some day if you'd think to ask me. - That's a bet. How about Saturday? - All right. Oh, hold it. Hey, hey, hey. Just a minute. Hold it. - Everything's ok now, Miss Bradford. - Sorry to have troubled you. I didn't... - ... know we were going home so soon. - Well, that's alright. Only don't be such a stranger. - Miss Bradford's car. - Saturday then? You promised to keep Arlene's name out of all... ...the newspapers. Be fair, give her a chance. - I'll pass the word around among the boys. - Ok, so long. Good night. Good night, darling. Sorry I was the bad girl. - It's quite alright. - See you tomorrow. Shall I drop you off? - No, I'll take a taxi, thanks. - Night, darling. - Night. - Thanks for the good time. Good night! Hold it, hold it, hold it! That's you - The crack still goes. - Oh, yeah? Grand tune, isn't it? It's grand for dancing. Arlene, I'm so glad I went with you tonight. It was good to see Tony Sterling. You like him? - Don't you? - Fit, rough and ready, but... - ... I suppose he'll settle down. - Say, Arlene, you think there's much... - ... of a future in reporting? - Probably for Tony. If his uncle dies, he'll own the journal. I didn't mean that. Hello you, Radsy, old rascal, you'll wake father, come here. - Be a good boy. - Good night, Val. Good night, Arlene. Good night, Arlene. Hope your headache goes, let me know if there's anything you need. Thanks, I'll be all right. Listen to this, boys. Just came:... ..."Chief O'Malley, police department, San Francisco,... ...believe country wide organisation using San Francisco as distributing... ...point for stolen securities. Stop. Appreciate you cooperation. Walling, departing of justice". What do you think of that? - I wonder where he got his tip. - Never mind, we'd better... ...get right on it. You cover the bank and security houses. Whatever you do, don't tip your mitt. - Good morning, everybody. - Good morning. - How are you, dad? - Did you have a good time last night? Oh, lots of fun. Spencer's so cute with Arlene. Oh, we ran into Tony Sterling, he's a grand fellow. - What kind of time did you have? - Oh, I had lots of fun too,... ...with my rheumatism. It must have been quite a party to have caused this story. Arlene, you promised to turn over a new leaf after... ...Now you're dragging... - ... Val's name into your notoriety. - Let me see it, Arlene. You're asking too much, both of me and of Val. But father, we didn't stay in Bello's half an hour. - Long enough to cause plenty of damage. - This is not Arlene's fault. It was the most innocent party in the world. We were with Spencer and... ...the only other man we spoke to was Tony Sterling. Don't try to alibi me, Val. Trouble with you is you have too many of your mother's qualities:... - ... unstable, violent... - Please, father, please! - Bad blood. A rotten heritage. - Sour grapes. You couldn't hold my mother because you're a mean worn out Shut up! I'm sorry if I hurt you but it had to happen. Well, I think you were unnecessary cruel. No, we had to have it showdowned. Aren't you making it terrifically difficult for Arlene's fianc? Well, there's another face of this situation I haven't discussed with you. What's that? Carlton's work has suffered greatly in the past few months. They tell me at the office he's been worrying. And we can only attribute it to his association with Arlene. - What? - Yes, Arlene. I tell you the girl is a pathological case fit for a sanatorium ...and I'll have her commited for insanity if... ...she gets mixed up in just one more scandal. She's really been wonderful lately and I want to help her. I'm going down to the journal and give those reporters a piece of my mind. We're trying to trace some stolen securities... - ... said to be floating around. - We'll inform you immediately... - ... if anything suspicious occurs. - Yeah, but we got orders to make... - ... that third checkup here. - Having a very conservative clientele,... ...we naturally take the greatest precautions to protect it. Just a moment. Carlton, will you come into my office a moment? All right, I'll be there just as soon as I can. Really, I was anxious about you last night, darling. I'm perfectly fit, thanks. Frightfully worried. Arlene, you... havent started that again... Now, don't start moralizing. I swore I'd never touch a stolen bond again and I mean it. I've been going crazy to get rid of all this stuff in the vault now. Truly, sweetheart, I was forced into this. That's what you told me two years ago when you first started this. Arlene, you tricked me time and time again and I won't stand for it. - Honestly, this is the end. - Oh, that's what you said so many times. Darling, you've got to help me this time, 'cause I'm in a jam. Arlene, how did you get tangled up in this racket anyway? Well, I went into it with my eyes open. You can't imagine the terrific thrill out of walking around under the nose... ...of the police carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars worth the blute. Do you realize what you're saying? Well, it's all over now, we're going to be married. Arlene, you return those bonds. No, I gave my word of honour I'd get rid of them. Oh, you gave your word of honour. Well, that's easy, you're in the clear,... they can't touch you. I'll be the one who'll take the blame. Spencer, don't be such a child. And another thing: I've made personal aid for you over eight hundred thousand... ...dollars in the market and what have you done with it? You've hidden it from me. I've told you I'm putting it away in a safe place for my dowry. Should certainly satisfy you Be a good boy and write me out a check for fifty thousand A. B Bouchard usual. Good morning, Mr. Bradford. It is very good to see you again, Sir, we missed you. It's good to get back occasionally, Jim. - Do be careful, darling. - Don't worry, dearest. Val, I had nothing to do with this. Your attitude towards life and people is cheap and cynical. Honestly, Val, you got me all wrong. It must have been Archie Van Ness. It sounds like him, he saw you at Bello's. Don't put the blame on anyone else. I know reporters. They put their papers above everything fine and decent. I'm terribly disappointed in you. Young lady bought out young man. I should have had a picture of that. Where's that rat, Archie Van Ness? I saw him going just exactly where he belongs. Come in. A radiogram for you, Miss. Oh, thank you, Thorne. Thorn,... ...if you don't stop snooping I'll have you discharged. Hello! What are you looking at? Why, Arlene, you're trembling! - Arlene, what's the matter with you? - I want you to do something for me. - Come here. - I was afraid you'd be upset after... - ... the scene with father this morning. - Never mind that. Oh, and by the way, I gave Tony Sterling the... ...devil for allowing that story to be printed. Oh, don't be too hard on the poor boy. Reporters make enough for a bust in their lives as it is ...here, I want you to take care of this. It contains some valuable papers... ...and you're so much more dependable than I. Are you planning to go away or elope with Spencer? You romantic child, of course not! I'm too commercial, think of wedding presents. - Arlene... - Well, if it's too much trouble Not at all, I'll put it in a safe place gladly. Bye. Bye. And please keep away from father until I can get things straightened out. Will I? Thorne's speaking. Thorne, I'll take here any incoming calls this afternoon. Very well, Miss. Is that you, Arlene? Did you get my message? Be careful, darling, might be overheard. - When are we going to get together? - Ten thirty, Bello's. All right, ten thirty at Bello's. Be good. Bye, darling. I'll take it. - Thorne's speaking. - Thorne,... ...will you come up to my room, please? Come in. - You wanted me, Miss. - Yes, Thorne. Will you have a messenger deliver this to Mrs. Spencer Carlton... - ... at the Sherman Arms? - Sherman Arms, yes, Miss. Hello. You'd better come right over. We want to talk to you. Hurry up. He'll be right along. Good. How did you come to know all this? It was really by accident that we discovered... ...stocks and bonds lists had been stolen... ...among the deliveries from the home office at the Honolulu branch. - We cabled you immediately. - Being a comparably recent addition... ...to Bradford and company, I feel doubly upset over the situation. You've done fine work at the islands. It's we at this end... ...who are entirely to blame. It's going to be a delicate job to make restitution... ...without injuring our reputation. We have an organisation capitalized at twenty-five millions,... ...every penny of which will be jeopardized if we lose the confidence to our clients This scandal must not become public property. - Oh, by no means. - There will be no prosecution. I personally will bear the losses because I feel that I am personally responsible. You've not been actively in charge. We'll all contribute. - How much is it? - May amount to two o three millions. Well, no wonder Carlton was worried. I have a strong hunch we haven't scratched the surface yet. Pardon me, gentleman. Hello, Spence. I want to have a talk with you before we go in to Maynard and Porter. - Maynard is here? - Yes, we sent for him. I don't care. Have me arrested. I knew it! Now you must pull yourself together. We're going... ...to straighten this out from a different,... ...angle but you must tell me the truth: is Arlene implicated? The truth, she got you into this mess. I knew it. I knew it, if it weren't for your engagement There isn't any engagement, Arlene has broken it. What? Thrown you over? After wrecking your life? I'd shoot her. Thorne! - Sir? - Is Miss Arlene in her room? No, Sir, she isn't in the house, Sir. Hold on to yourself, son. Go home now. I'll take care of Maynard and Porter alone. Keep away from the office... ...until this blows over. And don't worry, I'm protecting you, son... Good night. Hello, Spence, is Arlene? Well, what's the matter? - There you are - How much are you making out of this? You had your cut, don't ask questions. Listen, Arlene, I'm not one of those society punks that'll take... ...anything you wanna give them, including the air. You can take what you get and like it! Come this way. Well, I hope you care to enjoy this. This is my last job. - What do you mean? - Just that. You ought to know you can't get out of a racket as easy as that. Lots of important guys are dependent on you. I've got personal reasons and - Who's there? - Bill. Arlene, he's waiting in the private room. Thanks so much. Darling,... ...how wonderful to see you! Had a good trip? - Perfect. - I was so surprised to get your wire. I came on business. I can only stay a few days. - Well, what's the matter with you? - Nothing. - Are you trying to high hat me? - No, but things have been... - ... different the last few months. - Different? Not with me. What about your engagement? You know that was purely for business reasons. - Now give me my letters. - No, not in a million years! Now, don't be obstinate. Those letters don't mean anything. Nothing to you perhaps, but everything to me! You seem to forget that it was I that got you a job at Bradford and Company. You were marvellous to me, I realize that. I just don't love you any more. - You mean that? - Of course! - You're not joking? - Now, let's be reasonable. You used me when you needed me and now you're through with me. Perhaps the same plan that you followed with the young Carlton. - How did you know that? - I've been to the house tonight... ...and there is a very devil to pay. You take my advice. Stick to young Carlton who loves you. Go away and start life again a long way from here. - I'm going to the Islands with you. - That's impossible. Perhaps you'll change your mind by tomorrow. Give me those letters. Let's call this incident closed. Arlene. Arlene, you can't go like that. Arlene. Arlene. Yes, it certainly is. It's a ghastly business all around. The personal problem with Arlene and Spencer worries me more than anything else. Oh, don't let that worry you. It's decidedly for the best. - You can't mean that. - Yes, I do mean that. I'm glad... ...the engagement is broken. - Thorne, you give me my hat and coat. - Yes, Sir. I'm going out for a breath of fresh air. - I'll be back in a few minutes. - Yes, Sir. - Good night, Everett. - Good night, Oren. Oh, that's Arlene. Be still, Ragsy! Be a good boy. I'll be right back. Arlene. Now keep quiet, Ragsy. Arlene! Why don't you answer me? - Thorne. - Yes, Miss. Thorne, who was using the elevator? I was just going to see, Miss. I thought it might be Miss Arlene. - I thought so too. - I'll see if her car is in the garage. I'm going with you. It couldn't have been Mr. Bradford, Miss. Isn't father in the library with Mr. Porter? No, Miss. He left with Mr. Porter a moment ago. Said he was going... - ... out for a breath of fresh air. - Oh, no, it couldn't have been he... ...I can always tell when it's father. It must have been Arlene. But I can't... ...remember her ever going in like this and going right out again. Just seems rather strange, Miss. Her car is here. - Then she must have come back. - But where is she? The doors are open. There's nobody here. - There's a taxi. - Oh, no, it couldn't be. Arlene. Arlene. Arlene. Are you sure Miss Arlene used her car this evening, Miss? I'm positive. It wasn't here when I came home. Strange she didn't say something to me. Who is Oh, father What on earth are you doing here at this hour? Something very funny has happened. Arlene came home in her own car... ...and then went away in a taxi without saying a word to anyone. - And I hope she never comes back. - Oh, father. I won't talk about it know, but Arlene has reached the end of her rope. But you'd help her if she needed it, wouldn't you? I tell you all about it tomorrow. Good night, go to bed. Good morning, Ragsy. How are you this morning? Dear Val. I'm through. You have been kind to me. But I can't stand your father's way of living. Keep... ...the envelope I gave you. I may send for it but... ...I'm not coming back. Ever. Good bye. Arlene. Father, Arlene has left, left for good. - I almost wish that were true. - Oh, you don't mean that. Be fair. Oh, don't worry about Arlene. She's like a cat: bound to land on her feet. I'm afraid something terrible has happened to her. - No doubt, no doubt. - Oh, but father this is serious. Oh, you're wasting your sympathies, my dear. We can't leave her like this. - Thorne! - Yes, Miss. Get me the journal on the phone right away. Hurry, please! Right away, Miss. Louise, quick! Get my things. I'm going out. Oui, mademoiselle, tout de suite. Hello. The journal? Tony Sterling, please. What? He's not there? Oh, no. No, I'll get him later. Hurry, Louise, hurry! One moment. Mr. Carlton's apartment does not answer. Perhaps he's on his way down here, Mrs. Bradford. All right. Will you get me Tony Sterling at the journal on the phone for me? Tony Sterling at the journal. Quickly, please. Just tell Mr. Carlton when he comes in that I may be back to see him later. And do me a favour, have this put that on the vault for me. Yes, indeed. One moment. Mr. Sterling is not at his office just now. - Would you like to leave a message? - No. No, thank you. That's all. You've no idea, Miss Bradford how many of these... ...scares turn out to be simple misunderstandings. Oh, I know it sounds silly, but I know something's happened. - Arlene has never acted this way before. - We'll do everything to locate... - ... your sister. - I'm very grateful to you. Everything will be all right. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if she was at home... ...when you got there. You leave everything to me, Miss Bradford. Thanks, Chef O'Malley. I feel much better now. I've been driving around for hours trying to make up my mind to come through. - Oh, and one more important thing.  - What is it now? Don't say anything to the Newspapers. My father hates publicity. - Oh, not a word. - Thank you. Hold on your cigars, boys. Here's O'Hagen. Oh, yeah? Well, you guys will loosen up with... ...a box of cigars when I tell you what I'm gonna - You. - Right. All right. Come on, boys. You. No? - You. - Wrong. All right. Try it again. All right, boys, let's go now. It better You. Right. And don't let it happen again. Your phone is ringing. Hello. Hello, Joe? This is Spike. Got something for you. Spill it. Well, now comes a hot young blond mama- ...named Valkyr Bradford. Then disposes that Named what? - You better call her Val. - Go on. Well, this dame's all blows in the Chief O'Malley's office... ...office just now and tells him that someone walked off with her sister,... - ... Arlene Bradford, you know her. - Hold on, Spike. Say, Ed. Rip off that front story. We got a good kidnapping story coming in. All right, Joe. Wilson, get me the clips and the pictures from the morgue and Miss Arlene Bradford. And Drew, jump on your horse. Take a camera down to the hall of justice,... ...get an interview with and a photograph of Miss Val Bradford, who's down there... ...interviewing the police about her missing sister. Listen, Boss, let me go down there, will you? You stick right with that phone and write everything that Spike's got. Get me all you can for the first run. I got... ...about twenty minutes left before deadline. But I'm a personal friend of the Bradford's. That's swell! Sneak in all the inside stuff you know. Come on, Spike. Is this Joe on the level? Well, looks like your playmate got in a jam. Hall of justice. Step on it. There are no pictures and no information... ...on the younger girl. These are all Arlene's. Joe, the Bradford dame dodged the boys... ...at the hob before they could snatch a picture. - Here's the stuff, I'm gonna beat it. - Sure you are. Get an interview... ...of the old man Bradford and his daughter. Take Izzy Wright. Take pictures of them both,... ...especially the daughter and keep it exclusive. Ah, you mean futuristic pictures Get out of here. And don't forget you're newspaper men. Oh, are we? Look, those buzzards beat us to it. Come on, Tony, take it easy. Val isnt here yet. Oh, is that so? Well, we'll se you later. Drive around the corner. You see that stuff? You can't get to anybody here,... ...not even that old man Bradford. You hide in the garage. I'll stand here and catch her if she comes in. Ok. Hello, Val. Got it. Come on, Val, give me the story, quick. - Is that your man? - Sure, but - Give me that camera. - Oh, Val, listen. Give me that camera. Will not have my pictures on the paper. Val, Val, dont take it so big. So that's the way you help me, is it? Tony, don't take it so big. Val, wait a minute, let me explain. Val, please. Val, you know I wouldnt let anything get... ...in the papers that would hurt you. Val, Val! - Come on. Izzy, let's get out of here. - Wait a minute, Tony. What's the matter? You don't suppose Good Lord! Cold. Dead for hours. This is the car Miss Bradford's been running around in? Sure, Val used Arlene's car and she's been... ...driving this way all over town. - Oh, what a picture, what a picture. - Thorne, this is Tony Sterling,... ...let me talk to Miss Bradford, it's important. Just a minute, please. Miss Valkyr, Mr. Sterling on the house phone for you. I don't want to speak to him. Hello But I tell you it's All right. Tony Sterling's speaking, city desk. Hello, Hogue, this is Tony. I'm in the Bradford garage and I have the - ... biggest story printed since - As for the next, I've seen it once. Izzy and I just found Arlene Bradford dead in the back of her car. Her sister was driving all over town not... ...knowing she had the body right there with her. - Hold it, hold it. Got it. - Izzy has pictures of everything. How's that for a break? Shall I call the cops? Call the cops? You do it and you're fired! Don't tell anybody, not even the Bradfords. You and Izzy get down here with those plates as fast as you can and... ...lock that rumble seat until the deadline of the last edition. All right. - Gotta get another one right from here. - The boss says to keep everything Yeah, well the get these plates printed. - Open it up. - Hey, are you crazy? - There's somebody coming. - Is it? Tony, what was it you wanted to say to me? Listen Val, there's something you should know. - But it's for you only. Arlene - Arlene! That is, I mean, Arlene's car What he wants to say is leave everything to the journal. They'll do more towards finding your sister than anyone in the world. Oh, that's wonderful of you. Oh, Tony, I've needed you all day, I've been so worried. And father wouldn't pay any attention to me. He was furious when I Well, Val, we'll straighten everything out. Miss Bradford, your father wishes to see you. All right, Thorne. I'm in for it now. Oh, Tony, will you come with me? Father's been so upset of my going to the police... - ... that I dread facing him alone. - You bet I will. That's a swell idea, swell idea. Tony's the best man in San Francisco for the job. Tell Hogue I'll be along in about half an hour. You'll bet, I'll see you later. - Val, what made you go to the police? - Some very odd incidents that happened... ...happened last night and a note from Arlene that I found in her room. And then there was Spencer Carlton, he acted so queerly. I havent been able to reach him all day. Well, that's the way it looks to me. Don't worry about Carlton,... ...I told him to keep away from the office 'till things get cleared up. The accounts will be finished either late tonight or in the morning... ...and we'll need him then. - Better not. - Don't be afraid, I'll handle him alone. Sterling, how the devil did you get in here? I came in place of Miss Val to talk to you aboutabout Arlene's disappearance. Val made a great mistake in going to the police. You're making the mistake. There's absolutely nothing to have fears. But the journal is in possession of vital information... which leads us to believe that Arlene is - ... well, at least in great danger. - Sounds like a newspaper trick. - If this a hoax - Believe me, it isn't. Oh, I cant give you information now but... ...I want to know what happened exactly last night. Literally nothing. - Come on, be a good fellow. - He's a tough fellow that guy. Well, Louise, we know just as little now as we knew this morning. Come in. - A telegram for you, Miss Bradford. - Thanks. Dear Val, I'm in trouble and I want to come home. Stop. Bring my car and that envelope I gave as soon as you can... ...to the end of the Butcher Town Bridge. Stop. Come alone. Love=Arlene. It's from my sister. She's all right. I'm gonna go and pick her up. Quick, my hat and coat. Thorne, wait a minute. Yes, Miss. Thorne, give this to father and tell Mr. Sterling I'll be right back. Yes, Miss Bradford. Then you can't tell me anything? Well, I'm not at liberty to divulge the reason. Arlene's departure was no surprise as these gentlemen will agree. - It was a natural move to expect. - Of course I'm not the police,... ...but it's a mistake for you to withhold any information. It's not relevant. Don't say anymore, Everett. Come in. Pardon me, Mr Bradford,... ...Miss Valkyr was called away suddenly. She told me to give you this. Didn't I tell you the journal's fears were groundless? Arlene is alive and will be home shortly. Give me that wire. That's marked 2.50. That's only an hour ago. She couldn't have sent this. - It's a phoney. - What the devil do you mean? Arlene is dead. Murdered I think. Her body is... ...is in the rumble seat of her car. Don't sit there like idiots. Do something! Butcher Town Bridge. Don't you understand? The murderer's after Val. Mr. Bradford, Sir, I'll get your car. Press room. Spike Smith. Spike, I want cops and lots of cops. At the Butcher Town Bridge. And hurry! The Bradford case is blown wide open. - Let's go. Let's go! - Yes, Sir. Start the motor, driver! Butcher Town Bridge and hurry. - Hey, wait a minute, that's my cab. - You mean it was You're sure you're headed for Butcher Town Bridge? - I couldn't miss, boss. - Give it all she's got. We're flying now. Come right along with me over the bridge. Don't worry. I'll take you to your sister. - I am very sorry, Mr. Bradford. - Not a lucky day for you, Sir. What are we gonna do now? Listen. I'll hide out so she won't spot me. You grab the letters... ...from the girl. And then get what's in the rumble seat. - Ok, boss. - Look out, here she comes. Whatever you do, don't hurt the girl. We don't want her on our hands. Where's my sister? Where is the envelope you were supposed to bring? I haven't it. Where's my sister? Come on, cross her. I'll get what she got. Let go off me. - Come on, give us that envelope. - I couldn't get it, it was too late. - Come on, where is it? - On the phone, at my father's office. Let go off me. Let go off me I say. - Where is my sister? - Gimme your hand. You take her hand. - Jake. Jake, there ain't no letters. - Don't let her tell you that. - Jake Bello! - Get them, slug. Why did you call me? Now we've got to take her along with us. Go grab her. - The cops are coming. - Arlene is stiff for long Take the sister, take the dame with us. Help! Help! Help! - Val! Hold out. - Help! Val, hold out! - Help! - Grab him, grab him. Easy, easy. Help! Help! Help! Grab him, grab him. Easy, easy. Is he all right? Yeah, he's got a bad gash back at the ear,... - ... but I guess he's ok. - Pull it over here. Now catch... ...that boat before they get away with the girl. Come on. Pull it here. Go on. Shove off! Bradford sisters victims of murder and kidnapping. Police launch loses abductors in fog. Arlene Bradford slain; Step-aister abducted! Murder and kidnapping strike prominent family. Arlene Bradford murdered. Step-sister kidnapped. We have a few details on the Bradford case which has shocked the whole city. Arlene Bradford, step-daughter of the multi-millionaire... ...banker and philanthropist was murdered. And Valkyr Bradford, the younger daughter kidnapped by a gang of thugs. Mr. Bradford had offered a reward of fifty-thousand dollars. No, madam. We've heard nothing new. Wipe your shoes, men. This way. - Clean your feet! - I didn't step on anything. Right? Be careful with those boxes of yours and don't scratch the furniture. Now after shoving the body of Miss Bradford in the rumble seat of the car,... ...the intruder came up in the elevator and stood quietly into the suite here. - Coming up in the elevator. Are you sure? - Miss Val and I were affected... ...by the sound of the elevator running. Seeing no-one on the upper floors,... ...we both went down to the garage to investigate. When we got down there we found no-one. But I did notice that the garage doors... ...were open. In any event, he read the note left... ...by Miss Arlene for Miss Val. It was pasted on the mirror there. - But it was found here. - Hold it! Hold it! - What the devil are you doing? - I just wanna give it a futuristic touch. - Get down! - But I gotta be up. You'll be up for thirty days if I I get my hands on you. Come here! The telephone conversation you told us about, Would you recognize... - ... the man's voice if you heard it? - Well, I'm not sure. But I do know where the rendez-vous was. Come on, who is the guy she met here last night? - I don't remember and that's the truth. - Maybe Jake saw them. Sir, who are you and what are you sticking your nose in this for? Come on, come on. Lay off the butler. - We wanna see Jake. - Oh, well Jake isn't here at all. - He left yesterday for Sacramento. - Yeah, where is he stopping up there? I don't know. He said he'd be back tomorrow. You tell him we wanna see him... ...and don't you be taking any little trips. Well, according to his brother, Jake Bello, he went to Sacramento. Send out a dragnet for him. He might be any place but Sacramento. I'm not taking any chances. - Who was around the house that night? - Mr. Bradford, Mr. Porter -one of his... ...partners, and Mr. Maynard- manager of this Honolulu branch and Mr. Carlton,... ...Miss Arlene's fianc - at least he was until yesterday. - Don't forget yourself. - Fortunately Mr. Bradford,... ...and Mr. Maynard, Porter and I were all at the house when the telegraph came. That's a punk alibi. Carlton looks like the best bet. Where does he live? Sherman Arms. Dead since some time last night. Shot right through the temple. Ah, the girl's ring. - Might have been the motive. - "Forever in my heart, Arlene" Hah, chief. Looks like an open-and-shut murder suicide case. No, no, Carlton has been dead too long. Mr. Bradford might know something about the gentleman. - Don't forget the guy from the Islands. - Yeah, the fireworks didn't start until... - ... he showed up. - He brought bad news. Carlton and Miss Arlene were up to their necks in the stolen securities racket. You sure got good ears. We had a tip on that. - Go on, spill the rest of it. - Well, there is a lot of money involved. You see, Carlton's system was to substitute... stolen securities for bona fide bonds... ...and stocks belonging either to us or held for our clients... He then sold the good securities and credited them... - ... to Miss Bradford's account. - Except in our case. He shipped off the stolen stuff, never dreaming we'd check... - ... the serial numbers. - No news, eh? Keep up the search. Increase the reward if you think best. Do anything. Anything to save my daughter. Well,... ...Let's go home, Everett. We can do nothing more until the vault opens. I don't want to go home now. I feel closer to things down here. We've been checking over Arlene's personal account. It's staggering. She's had over eight hundred thousand dollars to a credit at one time. And practically all of it has vanished into thin air. That's the least of my worries. Well, son, did you get fixed - up? Never mind me. Is there any word about Val? No! And if you hadn't put your rotten newspaper above common decency,... ...Val's life would be in danger. Don't rub it in. I'm sorry. I know you did fine work in trying to save her live,... ...and I know how you feel about Val. Oh, thank you. Just put them here. They belong to Arlene. I want to look at them. To whom it may concern. January 12th, 1932. I leave everything to my husband. - Who? - Arthur Burchard. Signed, Arlene Bradford- Burchard. Married? Impossible. Married and engaged to another man at the same time. - Who is Arthur Bouchard? - I haven't the faintest idea. I've never heard of him. I do remember Arlene mentioning this man three or four years ago. - But I never met him. - Where did he live? Los Angeles. I think. I'm not certain. Say. I better get down to the office. Get a line on this. Well, thanks. So long. Good morning, boys. Let's get going. Listen to this:... A.B. Burchard hasn't been around Los Angeles for several months. Plenty of money. Mysterious financial connections. Owns a hundred-foot cruiser yacht, the N.H. Siwon. Slim thinking, boys. What do you make of it? - The yacht. - Mmh. The N.H. Siwon of Los Angeles. I think Tony's hunch is right. Now you two boys get down to the walk... ...the first thing in the morning and if you find... ...anything that looks like the N.H. Siwon, let me know. We can spill the story to the police and we... ...can get photographs of them boarding the boat. And if there is a rescue of the Bradford girl, you'll be there to cover. Val Bradford still missing. Where is Jake Bello? Who is Arthur Burchard? Have you seen this man? The greatest man out in the history of the... ...state marks the progress of the Bradford-case. Every law enforcing body has been pressed into service. Airplanes will assist as soon as daylight permits. Say, look at that one! That answers the description of the N.H. Siwon but it's got the wrong name. NOWISHN. What a screwy name for a boat. Now if that was only the N.H. Siwon, Oh, what a beautiful picture that would make. Hey, holy smoke, take a look at that! Well, what do you know about that! Hello, chief. This is Daly, Harbour Detail. I've got some news for you. What? Are you sure? Well, that certainly fits Jake Bello. Now get up to the Bradford girl! Then our case is knocking into a cock hat. The Harbour Detail has just fished Bello out of the bay. Well, Carlton is out and Bello is out. Goes right back to Bradford. No. - No, no, no! - Mr. Bradford, weren't you at the scene... ...of the crime a few minutes after it'd been committed? And didn't you say your stepdaughter should be shot? - Now, this is outrageous here! - Be quiet, please. How dare you imply Mr. Bradford? Somebody waited for Arlene in the garage and killed her when she came home. And then I suppose I kidnapped my other daughter. Thorne, have you been giving the police all this information? He has. That's his business. He is a secret service operative assigned to... ...breaking up the stolen securities racket. And after he had gotten the goods on Jake Bello, Arlene and Carlton,... ...all this happened. Then I think you should concentrate on Jake Bello. - Ah, somebody bumped him off. - What? Bello may have had something to do with the stolen bonds but... ...he has nothing to do with the murder of Miss Arlene. There's only one mayor suspect: a mysterious bird that... ...met Miss Arlene the night before out at Jake Bello's. Well, if it's any help to you I might say that I You're the man! I recognize your voice. - You'll have to do some explaining. - Gladly. You see, I tried... ...to get Miss Bradford to return some intimate letters of mine. - She refused and then you had a fight. - An argument, rather. You see, I expect to be married next month. And those letters in the hands... ...of a woman like Arlene Bradford Had you on the spot. What happened? She left the room in a huff, and I returned to my hotel. That's all. - Those letters must be very important. - Only to me. Where are they? I wish I knew. Gentlemen, I just recall. Val had me place an envelope belonging to Arlene... ...in the vault. Could that be? Right under the nose. Let's have it. The vault will be open in a few minutes. I think we're jumping at conclusions. Where the devil is O'Hagen? He ought to be here by now. Gentlemen, I doubt whether I can be of any further service. If anything... ...comes up, get in touch with me. Good morning. - I am sorry, but I think you'd better stay. - Your order, chief? - Yeah. - Here are some letters from the vault... Oh, thank you. After me, Mr. Maynard. Come on, boys. - Let's look these things over. - Ah, they are nothing but a lot of sappy... ...love letters, chief. I protest against having my intimate correspondence... - ... bandited in this manner. - Be quiet. You're mixed up in a murder case. Arlene, darling. I hope you will be able to meet my agent from St. Louis. He has been a lot of help to me in times passed. Particularly at Bello's fall some years ago. He informed me that quick action on the deal is necessary. We don't seem to be getting anywhere. Well, this doesn't seem to be all there is to it. We'll see how it raids under the rays... Why don't you hunt up Arlene's husband? This man Burchard. That's exactly what I intend to do. Hello, hello, hello! Go on, scram! There's nothing for you in here. Hello, chief. We've located Arthur Burchard. What? Where'd you find him? - He'll be here in a few minutes. - You don't say. Would you like to see some pictures? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? What did you do? ...He is sorry... Take a peek at these. - They're pictures of my cruiser. - Yeah, I took them this morning. I thought you might like to see them. Have you had it long? About five years. I use it for business on the Islands. I've just sailed it over from Honolulu. Oh, some more pictures of my boat Yes and no. Look at that negative through the light. You see, that's the way Izzy caught it through the finder in his camera. NHSIMON or NOWISHN. The letters are reversible. A very easy matter to change. Just turn the boards over. NHSIMON and NOWISHN are the same. So are the owners. Gentlemen, meet Joshua Maynard alias Arthur Burchard,... - ... Arlene Bradford's secret husband. - Keep your hands off! I did nothing you can hold me for! Val! Poor Val. How did you get here? Don't move! Stay here! - Well, he tried to shoot it out. - Good work. - Hold it! Hold it! - Get an ambulance for O'Hagen... - ... and call the coroner. - Ok, chief. Well, I guess that finishes my butler job. Thorne, you better watch yourself, you're liable to become... ...a well-known secret service man Here is to crime. Ah, they did nail you, didn't they, O'Hagen? Ah, it's just a little nickle in the arm, that's all, chief. Don't mean nothing to a guy from the south of the slug. Gosh, O'Hagen, I'm sorry. We have the cops staked out,... - ... but I couldn't tiff you off. - It's ok, Tony. Val, dear. Where have you been? What's happened? I've been enjoying Mr. Maynard's hospitality on his yacht. Jake Bello extended the invitation. On that boat, I heard of everything that took place. Jake Bello followed Mr. Maynard and Arlene home. They continued... ...to quarrel about the letters which, written in code, implicated Maynard... ...in the bond racket. Jake left his taxi outside. It was the one we saw driving away. Maynard must have lost his head completely,... for he killed her. Jake saw everything that happened inside. . Maynard, realizing what he had done, shoved the body... ...body into the rumble seat and using Arlene's keys, he took the elevator... ...to her room. During his quick search, he discovered Arlene's note to me,... ...pasted on the mirror, which told him that the letters have been left in my care. He must have hidden when I came in. Jake Bello waited in the garage until Maynard came down,... ...and then Jake tried to blackmail him. I see. Maynard was too smart and hooked him,... ...into the deal with a promise of big money. He got Jake to send that phoney telegram. They didn't mean to kidnap Val at first, but she recognized Jake... ...at Butcher Town Bridge and they had to take her along. Then Maynard's men threw Jake into the water and he couldn't swim. Did you get it, chief? I guess that's it. Ah, Mr. Bradford, how about the reward money? What, you? Yes, sure. You know what, my picture was responsible for the evidence. You know, the futuristic touch. What, you aren't laughing me out, are you? - All those angles. - Give me the city desk. Tony Sterling speaking. Gee, it's good to see you again sweetheart. Joe Hogue, hurry. And I'm gonna marry you. No, no, no; not you Joe. Hang on a minute. How about it sweetheart, yes or no? - The story is important! - I don't suppose I dare... ...spoil a good story. Listen, Joe, tell that rat Archie Van Ness... ...to announce the approaching marriage of Valkyr Bradford and Tony Sterling. Yeah! Well, that's not all. Here's the real story:... ...Joshua Maynard alias Arthur Burchard, yeah sure, that's the one! Well, he was shot to death... - ... while trying to escape from - Hold it! Just a minute! Got it! Got it! I've got it! I've got it!
