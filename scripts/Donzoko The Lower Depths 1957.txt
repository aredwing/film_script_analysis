Yeah, and so? Like I said, I've had it with the housewife business. What are you moaning about? It's ridiculous. Even if his family was stinking rich, I'd never... You're a liar. - What? - I said you're a liar. Aren't you getting hitched to Deputy Shimazo? That's all you live for. Damn it! Quit poking me! There you were, daydreaming again, so I just woke you up. Leave me be. I'm not bothering you. There you go again. Cut it out. Lay off the stupid dreams. You're just a two-bit, slam-bam whore. Stop imagining you're some kind of virgin. All women are liars. They even lie to themselves. Shut up! Look who's talking! Your wife's out of service, so you're sniffing all the bottoms like a dog. What the hell! On the money, huh! - Bitch! - Darling. Another day of fighting, is it? Please don't shout. There you go, whimpering again. Day in and day out. Can't you at least let me die in peace? Our racket's not gonna interfere. Why do you put up with this scoundrel? Leave me alone. Just leave me alone. I mean it. You were too forgiving for your own good. Does that feel a little better? Hey, Otaki, time to go or we'll lose our spot. Want some candy? You're sweet, but don't waste it on me. Oh, go ahead. Candy soothes your throat. Sorry. It's our merchandise. I'll leave it here. Hey, Your Excellency. You scoundrel! Who socked me last night? What does it matter? Oh, it matters, all right. Who was it? You cheat at gambling, you get it in the face, all right. Oh, I remember. Damn it! Ouch! Just you wait. You really will go to hell. Don't be ridiculous. How can you go to hell if you're already there? What the... Get down from there and start scrubbing. It's my lord's turn today. Hey! My lord! Who's got the time? I'm hitting the road with Otaki. I don't give a rat's ass. It's your damned turn to clean up. I refuse to do anybody else's work. If you won't, the princess has volunteered. Of all the nerve! Off we go, Your Excellency. Feels awful heavy today. One helluva lord, he is. Hey! My turn again. Honey. What? I'm all set. You help yourself. Aren't you going to eat? There's no point. But you've got to work. Don't brood like that. It's not like you're... I've had it. Won't be long now. Help yourself. I swear it's true. I can't risk breathing dust. Doc's orders. "Your bitol organs are poisoned with alcohol." You mean "vital organs." That's right, my bitol organs. It's definitely gone to your tongue. Another six months and you'll have full-blown palsy. Don't be ridiculous. I'm serious here. It's just that my bitol organs have alcohol poisoning. It's just... that, huh? That's right. In other words, I can't clean because I'll breathe dust. They say, "A little sake may longevity assure, but taken to excess..." What the hell is that? A little ditty. I know more. "The sycophant flatters with forked tongue." What the hell was that? Don't know. Forgot. Then why spout 'em? You got a point. All to say, I'm sick and tired of clichs. Day in, day out, every last idiot spouting the same old crap. So I prefer these silly ditties. We got lots of those in the theatre, too. Um... let's see. Isn't it time you got started? Cut the racket. I'm considering my options here. I just can't call it up. I can't remember a thing. And I did my share of studying. Who needs learning? It's your natural gifts that matter. An actor I know is a dimwit who can't count higher than the fingers on his hands. But once he gets on stage, the audience goes so wild, you'd think the house would split in two. Hey, gimme five pennies. I've only got two. What you're born with is what matters most. Gimme five pennies. If you do, I'll consider your "naturally gifted actor" a star-billing, tip-top, top-notch, sterling-silver actor. Hey, gimme five pennies. Eat shit! Stop barking. I'm more than aware of your poverty. Oh, honey, I can't breathe. I can't bear it... What do you want me to do? Open the door for her. Can't oblige. Unlike you, I'm freezing here on the floor. I'm not the one who wants the door open. One "yes" leads to a thousand. Oh, my bones. Time to go pick up some boards. Hey, the landlord and his wife sure are making themselves scarce today. Be grateful if they've both croaked. How are you? Not feeling so great? I can't... breathe. What do you say I take you outside? It's just about time for the sun to hit that vacant lot. Come on. Get up. Get ahold of yourself. You okay there? I'm sick, too. My bitol organs are... My bitol organs are poisoned. You make quite a pair. Off to a double suicide? Stop blocking the runway. You're ruining our dramatic exit. Scraping away as usual, huh? What? Just admiring the sweat of your brow. Seen my old lady anywhere? Wouldn't know. By the way, you're taking up an awful lot of space for 30 pennies a month rent. Three mats' worth for bedtime and taking over the common room. I'm raising your rent by 10 pennies. Why not just strangle me? Because I wouldn't get a single penny out of that. Why not live a long life and enjoy yourself? Wanna fight? Hey! Ouch! Don't scare me. I settled your wife in the sunlight. Bundled her up nice and cozy. You're a kind man. You did a good thing. "A life of kindness will someday be rewarded." When, I'd like to know? In the next world. I say I want my rewards right here and now. Cut my debts in half. Surely you jest. Listen here. Human kindness can't be bought for pennies or silver. Kindness is kindness. Pennies and silver are pennies and silver. Can't mix the wheat with the chaff. You half-dead, greedy bastard! Everybody runs off at the sight of me. You'd drive away the devil himself. Helluva greeting. But you know, I consider all of you my children. A landlord is just like a parent. Just like the devil. Hey, by the way, is Sutekichi in? See for yourself. Sutekichi, hey. Who's that? It's me. What do you want? Can I open the door? Might as well open Pandora's box. What the hell's that supposed to mean? - What did you say? - Just talking to myself. Hey. Open up. Why won't you open up? Hey. Open up! Damn it. What a hullabaloo. What is it? Oh, no. Nothing, really. Did you bring my money? Money? What money? Three silver coins. Payment for last night's merchandise. Last night's merchandise? No use bluffing. The coral hairpin in the gold lacquer box, the tortoiseshell comb and pins. Sold 'em to you last night for five silver coins. You already gave me two. I want the other three. I know I'm a thief. That makes you my fence. What? I never... Shut up! Get out! You bastard! And come back with the cash! And the curtain falls. Truly entertaining. What the hell did he want? What else? Chasing after his old lady. But listen... why don't you just get rid of him? Kill him and I'm banished for sure. No, you just finesse the details, then take Osugi as your wife and settle down as the landlord here. That's a helluva pretty picture. You plan to impose on my good nature and drink me out of house and home. Greedy bastard. Woke me up from a sound sleep. I was having a great dream. I was fishing, and I'd just hooked this monster snapper. Truly a dream fish. I was just about to land that fish. That's no snapper. That's Osugi. You landed Osugi long ago. Who asked you? Scram, the bitch and the lot of you. It's cold as hell out there. Why didn't you bring your wife back with you? She'll freeze to death. Okayo took her to the landlord's kitchen. Hell to pay if they catch her. Why worry? Said she'd bring her right home. Brother Sutekichi, gimme five pennies. Stop it with the five-penny thing. You've gotta think big. Hey, Brother Sutekichi, front us some silver, won't you? Better fork over now, before you hit me for a whole silver coin. There. How magnificent. A thief is a poor man's best friend. You just rake it in, without lifting a finger. Lift a finger? If work made life easy, he'd do it. Us, too. But that's hardly the way of the world. Danjuro, let's go get a drink. Hey, consider me on board. I can drink my fill. How's the old lady doing? Seems like her time's... Watching you work, I'd say there's no point to that scraping at all. What am I supposed to do, then? Nothing. Then how will I eat? You'll get by, like the others. I may be down, but I'm a craftsman. Not like this crew. Don't tell me you don't think I'll make it out of here. I'll get out. Tear off my limbs and I'll crawl out. Just you watch. Soon as the old lady dies... It's only been six months since I landed here, but it feels more like five or six years. What the hell would you know? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! I let you rattle on and listen to you! Hey, Okayo. What? A stranger? Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Says he'll settle here till spring. Where's my spot? This one's available. That's just fine and dandy. For an old geezer like me, any warm spot is paradise. Strange old geezer, huh, Okayo? A long way better than your lot. Hardly a board to be found. By the way, tinker man, you should take better care of your wife. She's not long for the world. I know that. That's fine, then. Come pick her up, then. Hey, Okayo. I've got something for you. Look. Real tortoiseshell. - No, thanks. - Why not? Ask yourself that question. What's her problem? She won't give me the time of day. She's a tough one. She doesn't care about my feelings. What feelings are those? I really feel bad for her. I can't let her be. More's the pity. Screw you. I really feel sorry for her. No telling what'll happen to her here. You've fallen for her hard. But listen: You watch out. Osugi finds out, it'll be hell to pay. That bitch wouldn't think twice about murder. Even her own sister. Quit yapping! It's bad luck. Just wait and see. Quit wailing, Gramps. I told you to stop! Doesn't please you? No sour notes for me. That's a shame. I thought I carried a fine tune. If you say so. You're a foxy old geezer. Hey, my lord, that candy lady buy you a drink? These days, it's not a sure thing anymore. Want me to buy you one? I'd be ever in your debt. But first, circle three times and yelp. What the... Just get on all fours and yelp. Time was, you were a swaggering, well-armed samurai. Yeah, so what? That's why. Do me good to make you yelp. All right! I'll yelp! But listen up, bonehead. The shape I'm in now, we're about even. What's the good of making me yelp now? You should've made me do it before. He's got a point. There's reason in his reasoning. What's past is past. Down here, we've no Lords or Excellencies. But let me ask you: Were you really a lord once? I've seen two or three lords in my time. But it seems to me, for a lord, your fall from grace landed you flat on your ass. You wouldn't know, but... in the old days I lived in the lap of luxury. As the shogun's vassal, I was in the inner circle, no matter how poor. From first light to last, I ordered everybody around. In the bath, I never washed or dried. My maid took care of all that. Liar! What the hell, you two-bit whore! And who hounds that whore for pennies? This world is filled with ups and downs. Take turns lending a helping hand in times of need. That's as it should be. Hey, stranger, hold your tongue. Watch out or you won't even see me draw! With bare hands? Your sword being... - He's got a point. - Excellent. I was just joking. I've got no sword. Liar. Here's your blade. 'Course these days the thing won't even split wood. That's what you call adding insult to injury. My lord, follow me. I'll buy you a drink. I'm grateful. Gramps, you're quite the scoundrel, aren't you? Never judge a book by its cover. - Hey, my lord. - Coming. The pair of you... You're in a fine mood. Don't mind if I am. "There once was a triangular fellow, who stood on a square platform, playing his song..." Unokichi! You're on a roll again! So what if I am? I'm fresh out of the slammer. "If you ever set foot in these parts again..." Screw you! My, my. This young man is clearly out of his mind. - He's a complete lunatic. - What the... Slice me, dice me, have your way! I don't give a damn! The landlady's here. You again. Hello. Welcome. I told you never to set foot in here again. Aren't you gone yet? You busybody. All you do is talk behind my back. I'll run you out of town. Bye-bye! Don't you ever let him back in here again. Got that? I'm no gatekeeper. Putting on airs like some guest. I only put you up out of charity. How much do you owe me? Why don't you add it up? I'd be happy to, right away. Hey, demon lady! You don't scare me! Who the hell are you? Just passing through. Lodging for the night or moving in? Depends how it goes. Either way, you pay in advance. I'll bring it later. I'll consider this a deposit, then. My oh my. He's out. - Who's out? - Sutekichi. Who asked you? You were snooping in his room. I was just making sure it was clean. If it gets too filthy, they'll close us down. I'll boot out any of you who don't keep this place clean. Then you'll run out of funds. What a shame. We'd make better rent from beggars. Just look at you. You're not some beached turtle. Get to work on that floor. Anybody seen my sister here? She's the one who found the old codger. And was he here, then? You mean Sutekichi? Sure was. But he didn't say boo to Okayo. Who asked you? You get right to work cleaning this place. Got that? Demon bitch. Is she always so touchy? No wonder, stuck with an old man like hers. They're not stuck that hard. Listen, Gramps. That bitch just came to see her man. But he's not here, so she took it out on us. I get the idea. But you know, Osen... why does she have it in for that clog smith Unokichi? Because he let it out that Sutekichi ditched her for an upgrade to Okayo. That's not exactly a lie. Are you going to clean this place? Not me. I'm going drinking. Planning to get sloshed and weepy? You're hopeless. You see, Gramps? She can't do anything but cry her eyes out. Sister. Why don't you try talking to this old man here, instead of crying? Talking gets it out of your system. Cut it out, newcomer. You're getting down on me, too? My oh my. Quite a life you got here. Well, then, I'll do the cleaning myself. Never seen your face before. It's well-nigh impossible to know every last human face. I know every face on my turf, down to the last alley cat. But not yours. That must mean your turf is just a wee bit smaller than the rest of the world. Sure, it's a piddly bit of turf. But every last thing on it is a pain in my ass. Where's the broom? Outside the door. Hey, listen up. Last night, that clog smith Unokichi was sprawled on the street, barking gibberish. Really drew a crowd. I had to collar him and stick him in the slammer. He's completely impossible. What happened to Sutekichi? Nothing happened. Nothing happened? I've been hearing rumors. What rumors? Don't you play the fool with me. Why would I do that? I'll let it go. But man, people sure love gossip. "Sutekichi and Osugi are this, that and the other thing." And "How I'm related to her, so this, that and the other thing." I'm related to Osugi, but only as an uncle. I'm hardly her Pop. Forget that crap. Why don't you hurry up and hitch yourself to Otaki? Me and Otaki? Don't you play the fool. It's the word on the street. You poor thing. Nothing but a sack of bones. Where do you sleep? Thank you so much, Grandpa. What were you thinking, walking by yourself? They threw me out, they did. Who did? Is that a fight? Hey, Shimazo, come! Osugi's got Okayo! What's going on? Cut it out! Oh, dear me. That poor girl Okayo. They're sisters. Unbelievable. It's just that they're both so well-fed. They get to eat their fill. Grandpa... What's that? You're a good man. A really good man. I'm just a pebble beside the river. I've been worn down so long, now I'm nice and smooth. You damn dolt! - Damn, damn, dolt! - Damn it all to hell! Damn! Damn it all to hell! Damn, damn dolt! Damn! Damn it all to hell! Money buys your fate in hell! Money buys you Buddha's mercy! This dimwit fool is broke! Let the heavens rain down coins! Let the heavens rain down coins! He beats me for no reason. He treats me like an animal. There, there, madam. Don't be complaining. Hey, checkmate. It's really true. I've never ever eaten my fill. What a sad fate. You've suffered so much. Take that! And how do you like that? That ends the game. Hey, stop playing. I won't hold it against you. Get lost, tinker man! I'm in. Another round. I'm in, too. Say, Grandpa. Will it be just like this in the other world? No, of course not. Once you're over there, you can finally rest. Just hang on a little longer. Money buys your fate in hell. Hey, card up your sleeve! I saw! What the... Bad move, rich man. I saw it! You cheated! I quit! Lose barely 100 pennies and you shriek like you've lost a fortune. You're one hell of a rich man! You've got to gamble honestly! Why's that? Why? Why, why... So I said, why? I don't know. Never heard that, myself. Cool off, rich man. Just think about it. If this lot played by rules, they'd be dead in three days. I don't care! Gamble honestly! Forget it. Let's go for a drink. Hey, hey... Money buys your fate in hell. He saw right through you. An unspeakable loss of face for me. You've got no natural talents. Your knight's at risk. You lose again. Shut up and butt out. Still made 100 plus five pennies. Those five pennies are mine. Though five pennies won't even get you across the River Styx. Let's get some liquor. Hey, Gramps. Why not come along? Yeah, let's see how you hold your booze. I just go red. Come along. I'll regale you with magnificent, eloquent verse. Lines that'll ease your cramped spirit. Let's go, actor. I'm coming. I'll catch up fast. Listen up. Here's one. Checkmate. Your move? Knight. Knight. Too late, now. I can't remember. Listen, Gramps. Back before my bitol organs were poisoned by alcohol, I had a fantastic memory. But look at me now. It's curtains for me. That's right. When I intoned my lines, you could count on it. The audience went wild. You wouldn't understand, but it felt like a thousand silver coins! You strike your pose, and then... Can't remember a thing. Not even a word. It was my favorite part. This is terrible. It's not good when you can't even remember your favorite things. Our favorite things are the very core of our lives. I managed to drink up that "core of life." I'm hopeless. There, there. Don't be so discouraged. Why don't you get some help? There's a place that cures sick folks like you. And all for free. How'd you like to go there? Go where? Where is that? It's at a temple. What's it called? It'll come back to me soon enough. What matters is that you set your mind to it. Start by cutting back on the booze, and then, once you're cured, you simply turn over a new leaf. Turn over a new leaf, huh? I see. Good. That sounds good. But I wonder if I can really pull it off. Sure you can. You can do anything once you set your mind to it. You're a real mystery, aren't you, Gramps? Grandpa. What is it? Will you please come and talk to me? Why, sure. Did you want... No, nothing. Your husband's quite something, huh? My wife got herself a lover, and he was a wicked chess player. Grandpa. Please tell me something. I'm just so Ionely and sad. I know. We often feel that way before we die. Now you just calm down, madam. Place your hope in the future. In other words, all pain will pass with death. Everything'll be for the best. That world gives you refuge from this world. Is that true, Grandpa? Why would I lie to you? When you die and go over to that world, you'll see the Buddha. The Buddha will gaze at you, his eyes full of great mercy. What do you know about the other world? Well, of course I know, boss. I'm not anybody's boss yet. Check and checkmate. Grandpa. If only I could really rest, and escape from all my suffering. I guarantee you will. So stop fretting and wait for deliverance. But maybe... I... I might get better. What good will that do? Want to prolong your suffering a little? I still just want... to live a little longer. A little longer. If there's no suffering in that world, then I'll put up with this world a little while longer. All suffering vanishes in the other world, and that's why... So, let's say there's no suffering. But what if there is? Who's that hollering? Me. Got a problem? - We all hear you fine. What's that, you jelly belly? Come now. Give her some peace. She's not long for this world. Don't bind her here. Since it's you asking, I'll give up the fight. But Gramps, you're quite something, aren't you? You're a fine liar and a helluva yarn spinner. Keep up the good work. Lies trump the truth every time. The tinker's wife is really going to croak, huh? Kiss all that hacking good-bye. Hey, that's mine. Damn it. Hey, Shimazo. Just who are you ordering around? All right, then, Shima-snake. I mean, Lord. How's Okayo doing? She still too weak to get up? Why do you want to know? Don't be that way. Tell me. Did Osugi beat the hell outta her? That's none of your goddamn business. Just who the hell are you to Okayo? Whoever I am, one word from me and she'll be gone. What the hell? Don't tell me you're... Okayo. You thief! That's right. I am a thief. The one thief you'll never catch. All right, then. I'll catch up with you... One of these days. Catch me if you can. But if you do, it's curtains for your relations. Hell, you think I'm gonna clam up in front of the magistrate? Don't make me laugh. The magistrate'll ask me, "Who lured you to the crime?" "It was the landlord Rokubei and his wife Osugi." "Who's the agent for your spoils?" "My landlord Rokubei and his wife Osugi." Who the hell would buy that pack of lies? Anyone would. It's the truth. I'll drag you down, too. What the hell... What have I ever done to you? But what good did you ever do? He's got a point. If you've done no good, that's harm enough. Of all the... Sutekichi and I are old buddies. You keep out of this. You bastard. My oh my. The lives you lead here. Get a grip on yourself. He'll rat on you to Osugi. So what if he does? You've got too much nerve. You'll never live this one down. Say, young man. I'll hold my tongue. It's time you made yourself some tracks out of here. Make tracks where? It doesn't matter where. Nowhere could be worse than this. You could head to Osaka. Even Hokkaido isn't so bad. Hey, Gramps. Why do you keep spinning those tales? You can't fool me. You'd have it that everywhere else is terrific. All lies. All right, then. Why don't you go find out for yourself whether or not it's true? But listen here. Who's to say that a lie is always bad? And who's to say that the truth is always good? You're a fool to wring your own neck by swearing to the truth. What are you going on about? You shut up. I'll make him come clean. Hey, geezer, is Buddha really real? What's so goddamn funny? Is he or isn't he? I'm sure he is, for those who wish him to be. What? She's here. Can't get caught in the middle. Leave her in peace. She still with us? I've got to talk to Sutekichi. Kicking me out? I'll go. Come on, Sutekichi. Come over here. Forget it. What got into you? What are you so upset about? I don't want to talk to you. Forget it. Forget me... too? That's right. All right, what is it? What do you want? A little late now. I'm hardly going to beg for your love. Anyway, I thank you for letting me know the truth. Why? You said you'd forgotten me. Or was that just a come-on? What? Already forgotten my face? Man, you're beautiful. But I never really loved you. Even though we got together. Yeah? So? So, that's it. Go away. Got somebody new? What if I do? You gonna see us hitched? It's all up to you. What's done is done. But listen. You humiliated me. After you said you loved me. But forget it. If you want to break it off, that's fine. If you want to break it off, that's fine. All right, then. It's all over and done between us. Not so fast. But... after we got together, there was one thing I was counting on. What was that? I was praying you'd rescue me from this life. Sweep me away from that husband and uncle of mine. Why wait to be swept? You can take care of yourself. Why not take off? Well, you know, women are women. It's harder for us than for men. Say, Sutekichi. Let's scratch each other's back here. What do you want me to do? You're crazy about Okayo, right? I know all about it. So that's why you beat her up. You try that again! Oh, just wait. Get her out of your head and listen to me. If you want her, you can have her... all tied up with a ribbon. But I want you to help me in exchange. Do something about that landlord of mine. A helluva scheme. Your husband's six feet under, I've been banished, and you're free as a bird. Why would they banish you? You're not likely to screw up that way. Come on. It's for Okayo's sake. With me, she'll be black and blue. You bitch! Listen here. I've got it tough, too. The sight of her reminds me that she stole you, and I just... I can't help myself. The nerve. You witch! Simmer down. Here I am, telling it like it is. That husband has been sucking me dry for four years now. And he's got his eye on Okayo, too. Just think about it. He hardly deserves your pity. It's not murder to squash ticks and lice. You could talk your way around anything. Haven't I been clear enough? Even an idiot should get it. I've heard enough, damn it! Get out! I suggest you mull it over. What the hell are you doing? Spying like a peeping Tom. Just... the two of you? All nice and cozy. I knew it. You bitch! Whore! I can't believe myself. At my age... You shameless hussy! Go on. Get out. Scram! You're the one who should scram. Get out. Get out. Don't make me laugh. You don't give me orders. Who's there? Oh, it's you. Just me. What were you up to there? Did I break a rule? But I thought you'd left. It's cold out there. Murder on us old folks. So, you heard? Well, I'm not deaf. But you sure are one lucky man. Why's that? Don't you think I yawned at exactly the right moment? That was a close call. You were just about to strangle that guy, you know. That's right. I surely would have. Just like that. The spur of the moment and it's done. The voice of experience. You listen to me carefully. This, too, all boils down to women. Considering my looks, I've known my share of gals. A gal for every hair that's abandoned my head. By the way, you stay clear of that woman. The thing is, even considering that husband of hers, she's hardly a damsel in distress. Hey, Gramps. Listen, old men have more wisdom than a turtle has shells. Shut up and listen. If you're sweet on someone, you take her by the hand and scamper the hell out of here. But what do you care about me? That's right. Time to check on our invalid. She die? At last. And where's her husband? Drinking home brew, no doubt. I'd better tell him. I'll go with you. I can do without corpses. You scared? Not my thing. Gramps! I remember now. Won't you listen? "The moon outshines the very bonfires where we roast our fish, hazy in the spring sky. The chill breeze intoxicates. Drifting contentedly, as a solitary wakeful crow wings its way home, along the riverbank dewdrops on an oar yield treasure. A hundred silver coins the unexpected boon. That's the spirit. Verily, is it a spring night? Better the river than the Western sea. The fallen whore brings better fortune. Unlike a mound of pennies, the silver coins come wrapped in cloth. What good luck, so early in spring." You're high as a kite. Okayo. Where'd the old man go? This place's deserted. I'm taking off. Come spring, I'm going. And just where to? To find that temple. There's a temple that cures drunks. Atop some mountain, where the sun always shines. A really grand temple. That's where... I'll purge that alcohol poisoning clear out of my bitol organs. And then I'm going to turn over a brand new leaf. Listen, she's dead. That's impossible. It's true. See for yourself. See what? The tinker's wife is dead. We can kiss that hacking good-bye. Better tell Tomekichi. He was her husband, after all. I know that's how I'll end up. Tortured to my grave. What are you mumbling about? I tell you, watch out for Sutekichi. He'll wind up... If someone's going to kill me, I'd rather it was him. Suit yourself, then. She's better off dead, too. I'm sorry for her. No need to pity her. I'll kick the bucket soon enough. So will you. That's all there is to it. Say... I heard. Well, let's hope she goes to paradise, since she took the trouble to die. Let's hurry up and get her out of here. What, you're worried she'll stink? Don't you worry. She was all dried up as it was. How can you speak that way of the dead? Don't you have a shred of pity? Now, don't get so upset. Nobody here's got any time to pity themselves. Better inform the magistrate's office. That's right. Better hurry and tell them, or they might think you beat her to death. I've got to pay for her funeral, but I've only got 40 pennies. In a pinch, we can all pitch in. Ten pennies here, five pennies there. Whatever we can spare. I know I'll see her in my dreams. If I see any corpses I know, I'II... I'm so scared to walk home alone. It's pitch-black out there. The dead won't harm you. You should worry about the living. Grandpa, see me home? All right, dear. What am I supposed to do? Sleep. So then... that's when I said... "I'm grateful you care so much for my miserable self, but God will punish me for my excessive good fortune." Considering my unclean body. And then do you know what he said? "Though your body may be polluted, as long as your spirit is pure, you're practically a virgin." Helluva virgin. Cut it out. You don't like her story, don't listen. Don't spoil a perfect way of passing the time. So then? So then he said if his parents rejected our union, we'd die together. He said, "I can't live another moment without you." That's when I said, "Ginjiro-san..." Hey, last time you called him "Inosuke." Hold your tongue! Hold your tongue, you bum! What the hell do you know about true love? I once knew what it was! Don't torment her so. Put yourself in her shoes as she tells her story. Why would she tell such a tale? That's what you've got to understand. Pay me five pennies and I'll listen. That's 10 pennies for two. What are you waiting for? Go on. Tell us. Just ignore them. I can't anymore. Nobody takes me seriously. I'm just a laughingstock. So then... this was my reply: "But that you'd waste your life on someone so humble as me is simply incomprehensible. Better, better yet, please cast me aside. I'd happily die for your kind intentions alone." I'm just a... You poor thing. Go ahead and cry. Cry your heart out. What a pathetic act! Gramps, don't tell me you actually bought her story. You're so mean. That's enough. Goddamn it! Sister. I know very well that your story's no lie. That's right. It's not a lie, goddamn it! I know very well. It all happened as you say. It's just that they're jealous. They're green with envy, so they mock you. Let's go over there now, and you tell me your story over there. Gramps, I... I swear by the sun. Every last thing really happened. But they... I know that. I know. And so, what happened next with this fellow? Man, oh, man, what a mess. But why does she spout such lies like that? I imagine all kinds of things, too... and keep expecting them to happen. What kinds of things? What kinds? Well, for instance... that maybe tomorrow someone will appear, someone good. Like that. If not, then something will happen, something good. I think about such things, and I'm always waiting. Me, I'm not waiting for anything at all. All the good stuff in my life already happened. But lately I've been thinking that I might just keel over and die. I imagine that quite often. And that makes me so Ionely. You've got it tough, don't you, with a sister like yours? Who doesn't have it tough? Everybody here's suffering. Not everybody, you liar! Plenty of folks around us live the good life. What the hell inspired that outburst? Say, my lord, why do you provoke her that way? It's her only pleasure, crying her eyes out that way. I'm sick and tired of her tales. Makes me sick. Where'd you leave her, Gramps? At the tavern. What say I go make peace with her? You listen here. You hold your tongue and console her. You're an awfully sweet old man. Sweet, huh? It's all a pack of lies. I'm not up to that kind of act. I'm the kind that takes my truth straight, no chaser. The bare truth! Wanna know about my bare truth? I'm penniless, jobless, and got nowhere to turn! I'll kick the bucket before long! What's the point of the bare truth? He's completely off his rocker. Now, just quiet down. Just listen. Shut up! You can stuff your lies, and his bare truth, too! I can't take anything! Goddamn it! He's got a ways to go. We've got to work on him a little more. What's his problem? Why's the tinker so hot and bothered? It's no wonder, the way he torments himself. "I'm still a craftsman!" Like he deserves to act uppity! Okayo... are both the demons out? - Praying at the temple. - That's a joke. They expect their puny offerings to buy them a spot in paradise. Some nerve. Oh, don't be so cruel. Actually, it makes them kind of sweet. At least they have a conscience. By the way, folks, it's about time I bid you farewell. Where are you off to? I don't know, which is the whole point of moving on. There must be some wonderful place. We're all searching for it. So, what do you think? Do you think you'll find it? You'll never find it. As long as you believe you'll find it, you surely will. I wish that were true. Hear me out, Okayo. Once more, in front of Gramps. Come on. Let's get out of here, you and me. Where will we go? To prison? How many times do I have to tell you? I've quit my thieving ways. I'll give you my word as a man. I swear. I'll leave those ways behind and get a job. Please, Okayo. I know this life is no good for me. It's just that... there are so many serious swindlers living high on the hog. That was my old excuse. But that's all it was: An excuse. I just don't buy it anymore. It sticks in my craw. But I don't regret a thing. Otherwise, I'd have kicked the bucket. But you know... I just can't help but feel this isn't any way to live. I've got to find a better life. That's right, young man. Okayo, why don't we leave together and find a better life? Why don't you be his support? The truth is, it's much better to search together than by yourself. But you know... I really can't trust what anyone says. Why not? I'm dead serious. I'm really... And besides, why should I go with you? You see, I really can't tell whether I love you or hate you. You'll learn to love me. Don't worry. The lessons are free, too. Come on. Say yes. That way, everything'll all work out. The thing is, I'm head over heels about you. Don't worry about a thing. And what about my sister? Oh, that one? She can go... Don't bother about her, young lady. The fact is, if you're out of rice, there's always barley. If you're out of barley, there's always millet. I broke through a ditch board. I stepped on it, but it was rotten. Say yes to him. He's the kind of guy who needs support. You're a solid woman. Just what he needs. See? Besides, think about it. If you stay here as you are, what'll become of you? You may be rock-solid, but with that sister and that husband of hers... You don't have to tell me. I know those two will suck me dry. Hold it! I won't let it happen. I'd rather kill you than see you end up like that. Listen to you. Not even married yet and you're ready to kill me. Don't say that, Okayo. Don't you understand? But Sutekichi, if you mistreat me even once, I'll just die. Hey, you two. When's the happy day? Don't be afraid. I'm not going to let anyone lay a finger on you. Don't worry, Okayo. This man will never abuse you. But he'll never amuse you, either. I've got his number. My God, what a woman. Might as well be a viper. His smooth talk is just that: Talk. Okayo. What are you doing here? Bad-mouthing your family again? You haven't even got the water hot, you idle wench. But you said you'd be back tonight. It's none of your business when we get back. Don't go, Okayo. Ignore him! That's enough, you two! You work her to the bone! But you listen. That woman is mine now. That's news to these ears. Just when did you make the purchase? What did she cost? Get away from here. Goddamn it! I'll show you! How scary. Don't you see? That woman just wants to get your goat. She's provoking you. Unbelievable. I won't take the bait. Same to you. Goddamn it! Listen here. You can count on it. I'll put on one fine wedding! Fine wedding, huh? What a joke. Bastard! By the way, Gramps, what do you think? About what? Gotten to like living here? I don't know. I think it's about time. Time for what? It's about time to pull up stakes. Don't you mean make a break for it? That's a mouthful. I'm onto you. You're dressed in pilgrim's garb, but I'd say you're one sly old fox. What do you say? Not nearly the slippery rascal you are. You've got nerve. My wife's uncle is a deputy of the law. Get the hell out of here before it's too late. You sure it's not too late for you already? What the hell... No, it's just that even the worst scoundrel has someone who loves him. But if he loses that someone, he's dead as a doornail. Leaving so soon? It's about time. That's good. There's always a good time for an exit. I remember well. I stayed out of jail by getting out when my time was up. My wife took up with my apprentice. He was good at chess but even better at fighting. He grabbed me by my hair, and I couldn't get a swing at him. I was so riled up, I figured I'd off the wife, but then I got wise and made my escape. That was an excellent move. I hated to see my shop go, but I'd have drunk it away anyway. Besides, I hated working. One way or the other, I would've ended up this way. Don't be stupid. That's the biggest pack of lies I've ever heard. Hey, geezer, what kind of bunk did you feed this wreck of a man? What do you mean, bunk? Say, Gramps, tell him, will ya? The story of that temple. I'm going to go there. I did work today. Pushed a cart from behind. I was standing at the foot of a hill, and I didn't even take a drink. What do you say? Look here. I've got Give 'em here. Want me to drink it up for you? Or squander it gambling? What the hell! They're my travel funds. Listen, you. Why do you have to ridicule his resolve? "Piety is the last refuge in time of trouble." "Belief finds glory, even in a fish's tail." Praise to Buddha. I lost, I lost. I got cleaned out gambling today. Listen, Gramps. The world's an amazing place. Turns out there was even a better swindler than me. You certainly are an optimist. The mark of a decent man. I used to fancy myself a leader in my youth. My pals all looked up to me. So what led you astray? You're a busybody, aren't you? What's it to you? No, it's just that I'm plumb baffled by you. You're a good man and smart, to boot. What went wrong? The slammer. Four years and seven months. When they threw me out, I'd nowhere to go. Oh, my. Why jail? There was this jerk... You did him in? Just my luck, there was a cleaver handy. Any women involved? It wasn't like that. But enough of that. That was 10 years ago now. You refuse to take the world seriously. His exact opposite. He'll get used to it in time. Hey, widower. What's got you so down in the dumps? I'm pondering what to do. I gave up my tools to pay for the funeral. Want some solid advice? Don't do a thing. Just let the world carry you along. That's fine for someone who can pull it off. But I could never behave so disgracefully. And you call sitting around like a coward graceful? Enough of your waffling. That's Okayo. This is serious. Just what did I ever do? Just what did I ever do? You ungrateful leech! Wait. I'll do it myself. Hey, what are you up to? Go get Sutekichi. I'll go get him. Please forgive me, sister. They've gagged her. Come, Gramps. We'll both be witnesses. A witness? No way. What the hell... That's enough. I can't stand it. She's my sister. Keep out! You lunatic! Get out! What's this? You hold him. You jerk. - Not you, too. - Shut up, you jerk! Cut it out, you bitch! Hey, this is my house. Hey, Unokichi. How dare you! You witch! - What a bitch! - Damn you! Cut it out! You're pathetic! I'll kill her! That was great. In all the pandemonium, I snuck in a punch. Shimazo, arrest him. He socked me. I would've socked him myself, if I was up to it. Hey, stop! Hey, you! Where's Okayo? - Over here. - What happened? Shimazo, arrest him. That's the very man. What the hell! Everybody, help me. He's a thief and a philanderer. He snatched my wife's sister. Hey, are you okay? What happened to you? She threw a boiling kettle at her. You poor thing. Take me away... somewhere. Hurry. Everybody look! Come look! He's dead. Murdered. Sutekichi, the old man croaked. Get some medicine. Hurry! I said listen. The old man croaked. Sutekichi, look. You murdered him. I saw you do it. Everybody did. You murderer! Happy now? He's dead. Just the way you wanted. Shit! You're next! It's too late for regret. Have a great time in prison! Shimazo, hurry up and arrest him! Here's your truncheon. Sutekichi. You're not the only one who punched him. I got in a good one, too. I socked him three times. He had one foot in the grave anyway. It doesn't matter. I don't care what becomes of me. But I can't stand letting this bitch off scot-free! I'll drag you down, too! Played right into her hands. She goaded me to do in her husband. - That's a lie. - It's true. You pumped me up to kill him to get what we both wanted. Now I get it! You, you! You didn't care for me! You two were in cahoots. Get rid of both of us and live happily ever after! Okayo, how can you say that? Now I see everything! Listen, everyone. He and my sister are in cahoots. They plotted it all out together. Eliminate the husband and then get me out of the way, too! You! You! Okayo, how can you? That's a shock. That's a lie. Why's she lying that way? You saw it all. He did it alone. They did it together! Together! Now's the time to gamble, Sutekichi. Get it right. Blow this and you'll lose everything. In any case, this is real trouble. Okayo, how can you be serious? Me with this bitch! You can't be... I won't listen! Okayo, calm down. Just think about it. He's the guilty one. That thief Sutekichi. He killed my husband. Murdered him. I saw it with my own eyes. Everybody else did, too. My sister and he killed him together. Please, listen to me, sir. My sister beguiled him, and together... They did it together. Please! Hurry! Arrest them both! And then me, too! Come to think of it, that old geezer snuck off in all the pandemonium. "Better not to get involved. Vanishing like whitecaps. Every person has a weakness." But that Gramps was awfully sweet. You, you're just human scum. Yes, indeed. He really had style. Osen went for him hook, line and sinker. Sure, I went for him. That Gramps, he knew everything. He was a great judge of character. The old badger knew what was what. He had real compassion. But you guys, you're only thinking about how to step on everyone else. That's a form of compassion, too. Only wheat deserves to be trampled. That Grandpa got enough of you and ran away! What the hell am I doing here, stuck with the likes of you? I'm leaving. I don't care where I go. As long as it's not here. Take the actor with you. He's headed the same way. I know exactly where I'm going. To the temple on the top of some mountain. Not those "bitol organs" again. That's right. I'll cure these poisoned bitol organs of mine. For free, too. Just you watch. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. That old man told a pack of lies. What the hell! That Gramps never lied! Shut up! Quit whining! Screw you! None of your business whether I whine or not! That's right. You whine to your heart's content! She's beyond help. That old man took every last one of you for a ride. That Gramps. Kept saying there was somewhere great to go. But wouldn't say where. - Trickster. - Liar! You're the trickster! Who the hell was he? It's true he lied. But he did it out of pity for those beyond hope. Some folks in this world have to prop themselves up with lies. And that geezer knew all about it. That's all. How's about a drink? But that old geezer kept saying the strangest stuff. Sit at the Buddha's feet "You listen well. You must respect people, no matter who they are. Because we can't possibly really know why they have been put on Earth or what they might accomplish. We haven't even a clue. It may just be that some person was born to do tremendous things for us, and for the world. Right?" You've got a point. There's no telling with people. Take me: Born into a fine old family in the shogun's service... in another world... Liar! What the hell! Some fine old family! Damn you! Our family crest was a crane in a circle, and that crest was emblazoned - This is pure hogwash. Damn it! Outside the formal curtains emblazoned with that crest stood five horses - No such thing. Shit! I'll beat you to death! If you really were a samurai, you'd say, "I'll cut you down." Your words betray you. You gotta hand it to her. You turning against me too? Won't take me seriously? Listen here! I don't tell lies. I swear... Hold your tongue. Now you see? How it feels when people don't believe you! How dare you! How dare you try to mix me up with your blather! I've got proof. I've got documents. Toss those scraps of paper. And forget about your horses, too. Where the hell would you ride them to anyway? But that bitch... Osen. Any news of Okayo? None. No news at all since her acquittal. Gone without a trace. I can't wait to hear which of them will drag the other down. Oh, Osugi'll win. She's got the upper hand. They'll banish Sutekichi. It was a fight. They won't judge him so harshly. Goddamn it! You assholes! What the hell! I wish every last one of you were banished! Hey, what's the matter? Why don't you all go... I can't stand it anymore! Damn it! I'll go die! Farewell. Cut it out. She's not the type who'd really kill herself. I've got to teach her a lesson. Her manners are outrageous, even as whores go. That's that. By the way, where's Unokichi? Hey, have a drink. Grateful. Seems you've finally settled in. One way or the other. - He's at it again! - Leave him be. I'm in an awful fine mood today. The lingering spirit of that geezer. No, one drink and you become a generous soul. But me... When I drink, sometimes I'm frightened. A chill comes over me. When I think about what lies ahead... Don't be ridiculous. What will be, will be. I wonder how Osen's doing. The truth is, she's my meal ticket. Tsugaru. Say a prayer for me, too. Why? Say a prayer for me, too. Say your own prayers. I'm leaving. Where to, fool? A tiger... of course, you know... wears its stripes... and a lion... I get it! You're your wife's "hapi coat." Hey, brother. I looked for you everywhere. One tavern after another. Hey, take this dried squid. My hands are full. Put down one of those sake jugs and free up a hand. Chief... this is really something. This guy here is a mother Iode of wisdom. Most cheaters are. Takes a lot of wisdom to cheat well. Anyway, a tiger means bamboo, bamboo means a sparrow, a peony... Hey, everybody, where'd you go? Hey, get out here! I'll treat you! There you've gone and drunk up your capital again. Shut up. Yeah, I drank it up. People never do anything but repeat themselves. Wake in the morning, sleep at night, wake in the morning, sleep at night. Goddamn it! Get out here! Brother, I love treating people. If I were rich, I'd build myself a tavern and make everything free. Drink your fill, eat your fill, and make a fresh start in life. All paupers welcome. If I succeed, I'll give you half my assets. Why not give me all your assets now? Empty my wallet? All right. I've got two small silver coins, and one, two, three, four pennies. I promise I'll lose it all tomorrow gambling. Man, it's cold. My feet are soaked. Here you are. Why not wet your whistle? But don't overdo it. It's poison. Sake can be poison. Seeing you, I hardly think so. Drunk, you're just about human. Fix my drum? Don't bang it with a truncheon again. Hey, that's right. Unokichi, you've got my truncheon. Cut it out. You're no deputy anymore. The boss kicked you out. You're no deputy, nor an uncle anymore. You're just the candy lady's husband. Your princesses. One's in jail, the other's a goner. Liar. Okayo's just gone missing, that's all. Same difference. An uncle without nieces is no uncle. Hey! You left me behind. Oh, drink up. Let's drink up and get to singing. Night's for sleeping. Come on. Why don't you join us? Night's for sleeping. Don't be like that. You cut your hand, huh? It's hardly a turnip. I sprinkled it with blessed water. I might not have to lose it. I feel sorry for you. What'll you do if you lose your hand? For craftsmen like us, limbs are life. Bottoms up. What else is there to do? You're all here. It's really stormy out there. Wind driving the sleet. Is my husband around? Hey, chief. You're wearing my "hapi coat" again. Looks like you're in your cups, too. No, it's just that... It was his treat, and besides, it's so chilly. And it's sleeting. Don't give me that sleet. Time to go home to bed. Sounds like a fine plan. Hey, Otaki. Why do you always take things out on him like that? It's the only way with him. Besides, listen. I only hitched myself to him because I thought I'd see some profit. Plenty of profits for you. Settled right in to the old landlord's house. You hit the jackpot. But I thought he had some pull, even though he was just a deputy. But he's out on his ear. Can't let him drink me out of house and home. Unokichi. Hear you've been running off at the mouth about me. "She's a paragon of womanhood. She's got a horse's share of meat and bones, but a brain the size of a pea." That's not what I meant. Why'd you have to let it slip that I beat my man? I saw you dragging him around by the hair on his head. So I figured you beat him, too. You evil brat! You're supposed to pretend it never happened. Imagine how he feels with such rumors flying. That's why he drinks. Don't you see? Get it? - Nope. You always get the last word. Have fun. You dopes. Let's get over there and drink. Night's for sleeping. You'll never sleep anyway. I say we drink all night. All right, then! In that case, maybe I'll join you. Pour him one. There. Damn it all! Damn! Damn it all! Money buys your fate in hell! Money buys you Buddha's mercy! This dimwit fool is broke! Let the heavens rain down coins! This dimwit fool is broke! Let the heavens rain down coins! Let the heavens rain down coins! Hey, everybody! Come! The actor hung himself out back by the cliff. It was such a great party. Then he had to go and ruin it. Bastard! THE END
