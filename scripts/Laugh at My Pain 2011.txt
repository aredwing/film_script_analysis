Everybody calls me Yuri, so I just wrote that down. 'll be going. "Eeny meeny miny mo, Catch a tiger by his toe" "If he hollers, let him go... " Nobody comes after the film starts, right? Let's grab a coffee. I'll go ahead. Here's your order. Is that everything? Yes. Enjoy your stay. My parfait. Excuse me. Yes. Cocoa? Yes. Isn't it sweet? Cocoas are sweet. That's true. Let me have some. Yep, sweet. Do you want some coffee? No, I can't fall asleep when I drink coffee. You'll be okay. You were sleeping pretty well back there. Um, I heard that you're married. Yes, I am. Are you just fooling with Mirume? Fooling with him? So I shouldn't be seeing him? No. I see. But I wanted to touch him. You wanted to? Don't you want to touch him? I'd like to touch him... But there's nothing I can do about it. If you don't try it, you'll never know what it's like. The donkey isn't coming by today. I'll be doing an exhibit at Gallery Rino. Three of us. Here. Come see it. See you. Hi. Oh, it's you, Mr. Yamada. You sound thrilled. You're here, so go on in. You might as well. Oh, Yamada! Hey, Matsu! Long time no see. Glad you came. En. I wanted to pay for my cocoa. Forget it. I treat you; you treat me. Okay? Besides, something good happened. You mean Mirume? My job. I'm going to Tokyo. Yuri. Oh, right. Take your time. En, where are you going? Let's go shopping for class. Our budget's 5,000 yen. What? You can't buy anything with that. I know a wholesale store. Let's go there. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm realizing that there are things in life that I have no power over. So you're angry? I'm not angry. Huh? You're angry. No, I'm not. Maybe I'll quit school. What? Why? Tuition's high. I've no goals. My dad runs a sign painting business. You're a sign drawer's drawing card. I realized recently that I hate school. You realized now? Your nostril's inflated. Shut up. Hey, En! Oh, it's you. Why don't you pick up the phone? My cell phone's broken. And you haven't fixed it? No, I'm too lazy. But that's inconvenient. Mirume! "Let's go out and play!" Mirume! "Okay!"... Give me a break. Hey, stop it. But I'm bored. Your phone's ringing. Your phone's ringing. What's this for? I'll answer it otherwise. So answer it. If I do, then I'll want to see her. So go see her. Are you stupid? Ow! Hey, what are you doing? Doing something like this. You're so stupid. Here. Stupid! Stupid! Are you all right? Here. Forget it. No, you should use this. Put pressure on it. You're always smudged somewhere. Yeah. It's cold. Yeah, it is. Hmm? It's cold. You want the stove turned on. It's cold. Let's turn it on. But it's cold. Too cold to get out. Hurry. Hey. There's no more oil. I know. Want me to get some? No, I have some. Why don't you put it in? What? And call Mr. Inokuma? What? He always does it for me. What will you do if you run out when he's not around? Endure. What? So do I call Mr. Inokuma? Why? I'll do it. Sheesh. Go for it, Mirume! Yeah! Don't be silly. Why can't you do such an easy task? It's hard. It's not hard. It's hard. That pump won't stop. Yes, it will. It was like, "Whoa, it's overflowing!" The other day. It overflowed? It overflowed. It's this here. You close this. Then, it comes out. Yeah. And you take this and open it. Then the oil in here comes out, and that's it. And see, the gauge here will show it's full, so you know. What? What, that's it? I haven't filled it up to the top. It's only half full. What? Don't stop halfway. Well, you can't do it yourself, right? No. See? I can't do it. But I just showed you. No big deal. Turn on the stove. All right. Let me wash up. Where's the soap? It's around there somewhere. You were mean, so find it yourself. Oh, by the way, I modeled for you right? You drew me. Yes, I did. Where is it? I have it. You've never shown me. I'm not going to. Huh? But I worked so hard. Yes, you did. I took off my underwear. Yes, you did a great job. So tell me, why... You did great, Mirume. Why was I just wearing socks? It's a fetish. You kiss better now. Holding back was painful. I wanted to see you. Mirume. Hmm? Want to travel? Travel? Yeah. Travel where? Oh... Dharamsala in India? India? India, huh? That means curry. Yeah. I don't like curry. What? There are people who don't like curry? Because it's spicy. You're a baby. You're a baby. I don't like wasabi, either. I can't eat sushi unless it's without wasabi. You're such a baby. I hate cola. I hate carbonated drinks. They fizzle in your throat. Don't they? Sure. That's why they're good. Why? And when you burp, it's gross. I'm home. You're home. Mr. Yoshida from the publishing company in Tokyo called. Did he call your cell phone? The power was turned off. I wonder what he wanted? Well, he called. Okay. Yes, Inokuma residence. Yes, this is she. Hello. Yes. Oh, really? Yes, I understand. Yes, another time, maybe. Yes, good-bye. What was it? My job fell through. Oh, that's too bad. I see. What's with the apples? What? The apples. The apples? Oh, these. The next-door neighbors went apple picking. They gave us some. Shall I peel some? Yes, let's eat them. They look good. Yes, they do. Ow! What happened? I cut my finger! Oh, no. Okay, let's see. Give me an adhesive. Okay, let's see. It's no big deal. It's bleeding. It's okay. Let's see it. It's just a small cut, so don't panic. Yeah. Life is long, so you don't panic. Hey, Yuri's classes are gone. What? Yuri quit school. What? You're kidding, right? Why? It's true. You didn't know? You're kidding. You don't know anything, do you? Give me. Mr. Yamada, here you go. Oh, thanks. Over here is better. Sir, is this all right? Pull it slowly. It's looking good. Is the air coming out? Is it too weak? "Cancellation of Lithography Class" "Prof. Yuri Inokuma's lithography class (elective)" "Has been cancelled. Credits will be transferred. " Huh? What? I can't get through to Yuri. Where does she live? Her house? Mirume left. Yuri's in Tokyo. I'm quitting school. What? I won't come starting tomorrow. Why? You, too? I've decided. But that's so sad. You think you're sad? Everyone's sad. If everyone's sad, then there's no point in saying so. There you go again, making no sense at all. See you. Huh? Hey, En! En! Are you okay? Be careful. Watch the branch. Where are the other two? They left. Oh, be careful there. "Happy New Year!" Oh, Domoto. What brings you here? Long time no see. That outfit isn't flattering. What's up? Just dropped by to see you work. Oh, thanks for the New Year's card. I have it with me. Here. Sorry, I didn't send anybody any this year. I just wanted to send you one. How's Mirume? Haven't see him at all. He's been cooped up at home. He hasn't heard from Yuri. Apparently she's not in Tokyo. I don't care. Mirume's so weak. You're strong. No, everybody's weak. So... "There's no point," right? Right. See you, then. "Live from Suzumoto Engei Theater: New Marionette" Oh, my. What are you doing here? These rice crackers are good. Have some, Mirume. Eat. Why are you hurt? If you want to see her, just go see her. I saw. Saw what? Yuri. Mirume? Hello. Those artists who are displaying... Yes? May we talk to them? Oh sure. Listen, my parents came over yesterday to my place. They were in a rock-paper-scissors match. Your parents were? And they won 100,000 yen. What? I don't get it. They won a meal ticket. You played a game together and they won cash? No, no. I don't... Um, excuse us. We're Sayuri's students. Do you know where she is? Sayuri? We can't contact her. Oh, you mean Yuri. She came back from Tokyo and said she was traveling. Where was it? Um... somewhere in India... That guy with fuzzy hair... What was his name? I forget. Have you tried calling her? Yes, but I can't reach her. Oh! Sai Baba! Sai Baba? Yeah, Sai Baba. That reincarnated guru from Tibet. You're thinking of the Dalai Lama. Here. I lied about seeing Yuri. You're spilling it. Oh, Mii. Good girl. Is it good? Is he all right? There's a hotel up ahead. See, over there. There. See it? Yes, thank you. Mirume. Need help? Yes, please. Thank you. Okay, up you go. One, two... Are we going? Yes, we're going. You're going. Take care. Thank you. Yes, come again. Thank you. Sure. Oh, sorry. Are you okay? I can walk. No you can't. Thanks a lot. Take care. Oh, no. My body's moving by itself. How romantic. Yuri. Hello? Hello? Yuri? Ow am I? Where are you? How are you. Mirume? How am I? Where are you? I'm sorry. Things have happened. And I don't feel like explaining. You don't feel like it? I'm in India. India? Alone? No. With Mr. Inokuma. Things happened. And I wanted to be alone. But if you're with Mr. Inokuma. Then you're not alone. What? I can't hear you. Bad connection... Are there rocket firecrackers? Huh? Rocket-type firecrackers. I've got the firecrackers. No, I mean the rockets. Rockets? Yes, I guess so. It's written on the package, right? You're right. Which ones are they? Wow. Let's have a war. A war. A war? With firecrackers. No, it's dangerous. You saw the balloon, right? Yeah, I was still here. When we inflated it and it stood up, it was... how big? How many meters was it? Meters? It was pretty big. Yeah. Up to there, maybe? Around there? It was pretty big. Above the second floor. We put too much air inside and a gust blew, so we all pulled on the ropes. And they got tangled on branches. That's dangerous. And the top rope fell off. The top? The top got stuck up there. Where? Up there. Huh? What? I was afraid I might not see you again. What? Is that why? Yeah. Are you stupid? No, I'm not. What, are you shy? I'm not shy. Why are you shy? I'm not shy. I can't believe this. So up there... Look, I won't do it anymore. I swear I won't. Don't do it. I really won't do it. I'll get angry. Yes, I apologize. What, are you shy? I'm not shy. Why would I be... What? Are you okay? I can't believe this. You shocked me. Sheesh. Let's hold hands. Whoa. "Just because you can't see each other doesn't mean it's over. "
