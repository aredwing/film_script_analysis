What do you think about that? - See, the thing is, I guess... my secret life | is a bit less secret than anyone else's right now. - Hey, Mahowny, you got a promotion, eh? | - Yup. - So, when are you gonna | junk that heap? - Why? It runs. - Good morning. - Hey, wild man. You been hanging out | where the action is? - I'm always where the action is. - We still hanging | out this weekend? - You bet. We're moving the stuff | into the apartment, right? - We should celebrate | right after. How about dinner | at Vivante's? - Vivante's? Are you sure we can get outta | there for under 30 bucks? - No? | - No. - You just got a raise. - Hey, let's not get crazy. All right? | Talk to you at lunch. Good morning. - Good morning. | - Miss Selkirk. - Congratulations. - Mr. Mahowny has just become the branch's youngest | assistant manager. - I see. - He's been handling Miss Selkirk's accounts and | trading interests for some time. - Well, perhaps we could... | get started, then. - Are you telling me that | the bank would be happy to lend the money to my father, but has reservations | about lending it to me? - We'd just be happier if Selkirk | International was involved as security. | - I thought security was... - The building itself, with | Miss Selkirk's bond holdings making up the balance. - In addition to which you have | my client's personal guarantee. - Even so, with such | a large line of credit... - Sir. - I'm sorry you had to | go through that, Miss Selkirk. - What was on that sheet? - I thought he should know | how much we're making off you. - Dan! - You actually make banking fun. - It's all about procedure. Just have to know | your way around it. - Well, I am very grateful. One of these days, | I'm gonna take you out and get you a decent suit. | Bye-bye. - Bye. - See ya. | - Bye. - Are you sure he can handle | a loan of this size at his age? - Oh absolutely. He has an impeccable record and excellent judgement. - What are you doing here? - We got a little concerned | when you didn't show. We thought maybe you were sick | or something... - This is not the race track. | - How much you got for us? - I told you, I need a day or two. - That was on Monday, Dan, | this is Friday. - Look, guys, I'm having | a bad run, so what? Just give me 5,000 more... - Five thousand more?! | - Yes. - Look after yourself or I'm | gonna have to do it for you. - What are you saying? - That we're gonna have to come up | with a payment plan where you give me a certain | amount of money on a certain day and until you're paid up, | you do not play! - You can't do that. - I can do it, I'm doing it now. - I thought we had | a relationship here. - We have a relationship. And that is why | I'm shutting you down. - For a few grand? | - It's 10,300. - So what am I supposed to do? - Go to the racetrack and watch? - Do I make you do business | with me? - Okay. Okay. Give me an hour. Yeah, give me an hour. I'll see ya in the garage | in an hour. - Couple of bozos | looking for a loan. And Martin... I don't see anyone | without an appointment. Understand? - Yeah. - What the fuck is this? - A bank draft. - This is made out to him. - Hey, you want it | made out to you? - No, but, uh... - What do I do with this? - You take it to your branch. | - My what? - It is where I come from. | - That is not normal. - I don't like my name on it. | - You will when you cash it. What are tonight's lines? - No, no, no. | I'm not gonna let you bet. - What? | - You're not betting. - I just paid off. - I know, but I can't | do business like this. - Take it to your branch. - Yeah right, fuckin' guy. - Come on, Dan. | Bank draft... - Teri, that bridge loan we did | a draft on for Mr. Quinson? - Uh-huh. - We're gonna do another 15 | for a cash pickup. - Okay. - Thanks, Teri. - You want this draft cashed? - Yeah, it's already signed. | Mr. Quinson's waiting in my office. - Okay. - Thank you. | Hi. Let's do it. Let's do it. - Hi, folks, we'll be landing | in Philadelphia very shortly. And you know what that means, | don't you? Here comes the weekend! - Just wait here a moment, please. Just for a moment, please. | Thank you. - Mr. N. An honour, as always. An honour and a pleasure. - Fifteen thousand dollars. - Thank you. | - You're welcome. - Here you go, Shooter. Here we go. Yo! Eleven! For 900. Nine hundred. Here we go. - No, thank you. - Blackjack 17. He's making some pretty big | bets on impulse. No consistent pattern. - My kind of guy. Let's take a closer look. Is that a Rolex? They just drive them to me. - That's that, sir? - What? - Six a.m. We gotta end it. - You're kidding. - We'll be rolling again at ten. Sorry. I got kind of tied up, you know. Guess you're gonna be mad at me. - Well, where are you? - Just out messing around. I, uh... I'm gonna make it up to ya, | Blin. - You better. - I promise. - You have a good weekend, okay? | You know you work too hard. - Yeah, yeah, that's all I... need, Blin, is one good weekend. - Eleven! Frontline winner! - Oh hi! - Hi. - You still here? That was a really great run | we had going there. - Oh yeah. Yeah. - Say... um. Stake me 200, and I'll share | my winnings with you. What do you say? - No, thank you. - Okay, uh... 100. A hundred! - Oh... I can't believe | this place is ours. - Oh, it's not. - It could be. We've got an option to buy. You didn't get a lot of sleep | this weekend, eh? - Mmm... - I'll bet you were out | at the track. Hm? Did you tell Doug | about coming over? - Mm-hm. - Oh, God! | I hope Maggie likes him. Wouldn't it be great | if they started dating? We could do things together, | the four of us... - Uh-huh. - Go out, have fun, hm? Did you win anything? - Sort of. - How much? - I came home with 500. - Wow. Cool. Ending with | a bench-clearing brawl, and the puck crossing | the goal line. The standings: Minnesota | leads Winnipeg by six points, the Leafs by 15. Yeah, I want 30 | on North Carolina. - Thirty? Hey, Dan, | you're scaring me. - Take it or leave it. - What, are you trying | to clean me out? - I really need this one, Frank. - You got 30 grand? - You're gonna take | my action or not? - I wanna take it, | but I'm gonna need a little something | from you every Monday. And I don't mean Tuesday, | I don't mean Wednesday. I mean Monday. - Fine, 30 on North Carolina. - Well, she's a nice girl. Belinda's known her as long | as I've known you. - Is she like Belinda? - Uh, no. But, hey, | if you don't like her, you know, | we'll just watch the game. - Why, you got money on it? - North Carolina. One-and-a-half-point pick. - Right. So, uh, | how's that work again? - Thing is, I win if North Carolina wins by two points | or more. - Wow, Dan, you really | go for it, eh? You know, we should get some | serious play in some time. - Like what? - Well, we've never been down | to Atlantic City. - Right. We should do | that some time. - It's Clubs, Dan. North Carolina | hanging on... This game is over, folks! No, it's not! Plankton has | committed a foul at the buzzer! Oh boy, what a game! Will you look at | the North Carolina bench?! Have North Carolina won | by one, two, or three points? - Dan, what's your problem? | North Carolina have won anyways. - Give me one. Just one. - Ah, shit. This is not good. - Yes! - Give me one. Just one. North Carolina have won | this game by just one point. - Damn. And that's all it takes. Unfortunately, a solid team, too many injuries | so far this season. - Who's for coffee? - Bill Gooden wants to see you. Sounded kind of urgent. - 'Morning. - 'Morning. - Alex Reismer called | about the Selkirk loan? - Oh, right. - He's coming down to sign out | the operating funds. - I'll get the paperwork ready. What's the number? - They need 200,000. Cash. - Hey, Dan! Your cash is here; | the Selkirk account, 300,000. Uh, is it gonna be collected | today or not? - Uh, it'll be here in an hour. - Pardon? - An hour? - Oh, I have to wait an hour? - What, you got a hot date? - Something like that. - Want me to sign for it? - Would you mind? - My pleasure. | - Oh, great! - Thanks. - How are you? - Anything to declare? - No, sir. - $100,000. - Thank you very much. - Excuse me, sir, there's been | a mistake in the accommodations. My apologies, Mr...? - Uh, Doug. - Mr. Mahowny. Victor Foss. I just want you to know | that my casino is your casino. I set aside a table | at La Gioconde so you can sample | our excellent European cuisine. - Thank you. - Perhaps you'd prefer | the Hyakida Steakhouse? - Uh, barbecued ribs | would be good, with no sauce | and a Coke. - Mr. Mahowny would like | barbecued ribs, no sauce and a Coke. - Thank you. - Mr. Mahowny, your new room key. - Hey, Dan. Danny, | listen man, forget the tables; | you won't want to keep playing when | you see our room! - Yeah, it's courtesy | of the casino. - Really? - Take these and hold | onto them for me. Don't give 'em back | no matter what I say. Understand? - Jesus! That's gotta | be at least... - Forty grand. - Forty grand! - Yes... It's a new | system I'm working. You gonna take 'em or not? - Yeah. - Come back in an hour or two and | I'll have some more for you. Okay? - Yeah, sure. - All right, I'll see you later. - Is that ribs, no sauce? - Mm-hm. - He's still playing. - I don't want him interrupted, | take them back. And tell them to make some more. I want 'em on permanent standby, | is that understood? - Doug, give me my money. - What? - Give me my money. - Dan, you told me not to, remember? | - I've changed my mind. - You brought a curse to | that table, you know that? Give me my money | and stay away from me. - Come on, man, | I can't let you do this. We're talking 40 grand! - Forty grand of my money. - You gotta calm down, walk outta | here now and think this through. - For the last time, give me my money and stay away from me. - Okay. Fine. Fine. Come on, Dan. - What? - What are you doing?! | - What?! - You lost your way, or something? - Yeah. Yup, yup. Yup. - Hey, hey, take it easy, man. Uh, you want a rib? We got plenty, but, uh, no sauce. - I'm putting you on the floor. - You're kiddin'! - I wish I was. Bernie, isn't it? - Um, yes sir. - That guy you found | in the stairwell, Mr. Ribs, he likes you. And you're gonna stick to him. - Uh, sir, I... | I didn't do nothing. - Well, then, don't do | nothing again. Now get out of my office before | I change my mind! - Yes sir! | And thank you very much, sir. I won't let you down. | I won't let you down. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. You okay? - Where's the washroom? - Uh, there, there and there. - Okay. - So where's Danny boy? - He's busy. - What, he doesn't eat lunch? - Work always comes | first with Dan. Except when he's | at the track. He doesn't go that often. - Belinda, you told | me yourself! You've got no idea | how hard he works. Anyone who works | as hard as he does has a right to do what he wants | with his disposable income. - You got that bank draft | for me, Teri? - Bank draft? - From the Selkirk loan account. | - Selkirk... Um, there is so much activity on that account, I can't keep up. | - I know the feeling. - Oh, yeah, here we are. I'm acting for investors | looking for short-term security. - You've come to the right place. - I was thinking of bearer bonds? - That's not a bad idea. | Bonds are secure. Great way of moving money | around fast. Okay, so would you like me to open up an account | for you right now? - Yeah, uh, 200,000 in the name | of Roger Oskaner. - Okay. Hey, you see those Bluejays | on Monday night? - Seven to five? | - Those guys are hot. - Oh boy, here comes trouble. | - Big trouble. - Let me guess, Selkirk? | - Nope, Oskaner. - Oh, Oskaner. - He wants to sell bonds | at market rate. - Mahowny. - Banker! - Yeah, uh... where... | where have you been? I called four times already. - So you wanna hear the lines? - Hold on. - Hey, banker, you there? | What the fuck?! - Uh... I can't do this now. - You're not playing today? - Give me all the home teams | in the National, and all the away teams | in the American. - You're kidding? - Uh, every game | for the $1,000 max. - You're the man. - The Selkirk account seems to be | moving at incredible speed. Perhaps we should find out | what their schedule is, and advise regional office. - Uh, you know, a higher line of credit would be a lot simpler. - Okay, good idea. Keep her sweet, Dan. - Right. - You've opened a loan account | for Pembro Trading? - Finally, yes. - I thought they'd run into | partnership problems. - I guess things are rolling. Uh, the documentation was all in | place; you approved it yourself. - Okay. And... Jake Arnold. - Jake Arnold, same thing. - How long ago did we | authorize credit? - Two years. - And he's never borrowed | against it until now? - No, but he could have. - It's strange; you know, I think | he set the whole thing up just so he could | tell his friends he had a million-dollar | credit line. - Maybe business got bad. Maybe he won't be handing out | jars of peanuts this Christmas. - He really does that? | - Sure. - Even his, uh... desk | is peanut-shaped. - You're kidding? - No. - What a guy. - Yeah, what a nut. - Good work, Dan. - Thank you, Bill. - Dan, there's a problem: | Roger Oskaner. - What's the problem? - An interest payment overdue. - No problem, | he's selling bonds today. He stopped by to sign the order | and pick up his cash. - He did? I missed him again? Jeez. I'm gonna have | to start bagging lunch, see if I can lay eyes | on this guy. He's a goddamn phantom. Oskaner The Phantom. - Dan! You picked one hell of a night. The Pointer Sisters are in town. Wanna see the show, | just let me know. - Thank you. - Anything you need right now? - Well, uh... maybe later I might | have some ribs. - Oh, of course. And Bernie's right here | to take care of you. 'Evening, Mr. M. Ready when you are. - Ribs, the man wants ribs. - Hello? - Hi, Dan. - Hi. Uh... I think there's been a mistake. - Dan, I am no mistake. Now why don't you slide right on | over here and keep me company. Hello? - He told her that he was only interested in Lady Luck. - No sex, no booze, no drugs... our little roller is a purist. He's a goddamn thoroughbred. All he cares about | is the next hand. He's a beauty. He's a beauty! I love him. I love him! - The iceman. - You know, I was thinking... You know, we could get away. Go away for a weekend, | or something. Just you and me. - Yeah? - Yeah, jump on a plane. Go anywhere. - Are you serious? - Yes. - 'Cause I'd really like that. And there are some | really great deals going this time of year. - Great, I'll look into it, | all right? I promise. - Maybe somewhere hot? - Somewhere hot. Okay? - Okay. - Give me all the home teams, | every game, both Saturday and Sunday. - Uh, you want the CFL too? - All the underdogs. | - Every game? - Yeah. I won't be around | this weekend, tell Frank I want the one horse | in every race, both tracks. - Every race? You don't even | know who's running! - For the maximum. | I'll see you Monday. - I don't know if Frank'll cover | you on this one. - I'm sure he will. - Have a nice weekend, | Mrs. Quinson. - And when are you | gonna get married? - Ma, don't bother my friends! - I hate it when he makes stupid bets. | - Why not? - It's disrespectful | to my business and to me. - Yeah, but Frank, it's easy money. - I'll take his action | if he'll play for real. That way I feel better | about taking his money. - Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! He's probably mad at me. | They all get mad at you. They lose, and it's | your fault, you know. Very fucked up. - Maybe we should get mad at them. - Yeah, maybe we should. | Maybe we should. Maybe we should. You know... you know why he wants to win? - Why? - So he has the money | to keep losing. Now how fucked up is that? Huh! So you wanna get heavy? - Nah, let's leave it | the way it is. He enjoys it, you know. He | enjoys seeing me every Monday. It's important to him. Anyway, so there's something | I want you to get... - You got enough to shut him down? - Yeah, maybe. But Frank Perlin's | nothing, Jim. I wanna... I wanna tap | into his whole network. - You got authorization for a tail yet? | - Yeah. - So how much more do | you need from me? - You know how much Bell charges | for this stuff here? That's 50 bucks a line. You got this whole sweet | operation going on here. What do you give me? | Uh, nothing relevant. Nothing relevant. Oh, look! | Nothing relevant! I want names, Jim. Names! - Hey, girl. - Hey. Hey, you. You. - I'll be right back. Hey guys, is there a problem here? - No problem. | You taking a trip? - Now look, our deal is | I see you on Monday. - Yeah. With 40. - You said 20. - I know, but now, it's gotta be 40. - Okay, 40. I'll see you Monday. - Is that your girlfriend? | - You leave her out of this. - She's pretty. - You kids take care | of yourselves. - All right. | - We should go to the gate. - Who were they? - Just some friends of mine | from the track. - I don't think you should be seen | with people like that, Dan. You work in a bank, they might | damage your prospects. - Just forget about it. It's not gonna | spoil our weekend. - Steve, I got a name here for you. | An associate at Perlin's: Dan Mahowny. | Have that checked out for me? - Yeah, I will. - Mmm! Honey-dipped. - Honey-glazed. - You like it? - Oh, I love it! | It's stunning. But how much is it gonna cost? - A friend of mine | comes here a lot. - Yeah? - Swung me a deal. | - Oh...! - I want this to be | a special time. - Okay. Me too. Just... - Can you believe that? - Yeah. - It's very pornographic. - Dan! - Honey? - Yeah. - I'm gonna go for a walk, | take a look around. - Oh... Okay. - I got nothing against | Atlantic City, Dan. Victor Foss runs a hell | of an organization for us. But hey, Vegas is Vegas. Vegas | is where you come to play. I guess so. - Anything you need right now? | - I wanna be low-key. No fuss, no one | following me around. - He's at our casino in Vegas, in the region of 500,000. Cash. - Fuck. Fuck Nevada. Fucking headhunters! - So what the hell did you do | to Mahowny? - I... I didn't do nothin'. - Oh, you didn't do nothin'? - How come he's in Vegas | and not here? - I... I don't... I don't know. - You're fired, you piece of shit. - Wh...? - Good feel. All coming to four. - Ten on four. - Come on, shooter. - Come on, baby, | you've been good so far. - Yeah! All right! Yeah! - I thought this guy was a chump. - So what do you | want to know? - Everything Vegas doesn't. His mother's birthday, | how he likes his steaks... Uh, if he wears boxer shorts | or butt-huggers, you got me? - Loud and clear. - Come back at dawn and tell me | who the hell this Mahowny is. - I just heard that Mahowny is up over a million. - What? - Yes. - He's beating Vegas? Mahowny is beating Vegas! Okay. Get your man in Vegas | onto the floor, tell him to shoot him. - Sir? | - Chloroform him! Break his legs! Get him outta | there before he loses it all! Now! - Bring it home to papa. All right. He's hot, he's hot. | He's burning up. - I've been looking | for you everywhere. You know how long I was | waiting for you in the room? - Honey, just give me | a couple more minutes? I'm on a roll here. - Ma'am, could you step away | from the table, please? - What? - I must insist; the players | can't be disturbed right now. - Dan? - Just a few more minutes. - All right? That's all. - But what about our weekend? - Ju-just... a few more minutes. All right? - Roll the dice, please, sir. - Come on, Dan, stay hot now. - Come on, this is your call. | Let's do it. - You can do it, man. - Looking for a seven or eleven. | Seven! - Beautiful, beautiful. Beautiful. - Everybody loses in Vegas. - What do you mean, no record? - I mean, like nothing. Not even... a jaywalking ticket? The only unusual thing | about him is how many. - How many what? - Well, if you move the letters | of his name around, it spells how many. Mahowny - how many. - Uh, you don't say. | I'll file a report. - He works in a bank. Maybe | Perlin's got plans for him. Laundering money and stuff? - You know anything about | the banking business, Steve? - I guess not. - I got a brother-in-law used | to work in that bank... that's ten years ago, but... you gotta ask permission | to get married. - No way. - You think we got a lot | of regulations? - Yes, I do, as a matter of fact. - He makes 22,000 a year Canadian. - So he's some trust-fund punk? - No. - Where the hell does he get | all the money? - I don't know. The usual? - Drugs?! No way. You have to see this guy. - Well, I got a little theory going. It's kind of what you might call | a long shot, but I think that... - Yeah? - Excuse me, sir, but I thought | you might like to know... that Mr. Mahowny has left Vegas. - What? Already? - He's transferred 250,000 | to our cage... He's taken the rest back | with him to Toronto. | - He won? - Yes. You could definitely call this a win. - So... he's gonna come back. And he's loaded. - What's this man doing | in my office? Who is this man? Pay him, and get him outta here. And find that kid I fired. - Bernie? - Yeah. - Tell him he's got his job back. - Dan? - Oh, I'm really sorry. - For what, exactly? - I... I never meant to leave | you alone. I... I tried to find you | but you'd left and I... And I guess I just | missed you. I... - It's okay, I understand. - You do? - You gotta do what you gotta do. I know you can't help yourself, Dan. | You got a gambling problem and we are gonna deal | with this together. - No, Blin, you | don't understand. - No, I've been reading up | about this, and the first thing | you gotta do is admit it to yourself. - Blin, you got things wrong. - Just say it, Dan. | If you just say it! - I don't have a gambling problem. - Do you think I'm an idiot?! - I have a... a financial problem. - You owe money? - Yes. - To the men at the airport? - Yes. And I know what I'm doing. All right? You gotta trust me. | Please. - I have $2,000 | in my savings account. If I cash in my retirement plan, it's another 3,000. | Will that help? Will that make us | into a normal couple? How much do you owe, | for chrissakes? Twenty thousand? - Where did you get that number? - I made it up! - Look, Blin, I... I know I've not been here | for you lately, but things are different now. I... I had a great run last night, | and that guy at the airport, I can pay him back in full. - And then what? - Things will be different. - Did we go to Vegas so you could | clear a gambling debt? 'Cause you know why | I thought we went there? I mean, when I saw the room | and everything... I mean, what was I supposed | to think? Why do people go to Vegas? I thought we were | gonna get married! I mean, that's what normal | people do in Vegas. It's not how | I'd have planned it, but if you'd asked, | I'd have said... yes. - I'm sorry. I'm... sorry. Do you want me to leave? - How ya doin', banker? So you have a good time | In Vegas? - Not bad. | - Yeah? You don't look good. - Maybe the little lady | didn't let him sleep. - Something like that. - Thank you. - Is it still snowing out there? - Yeah. - What kind of snow? - I don't know. Big snow? - Big? I'm gonna take a hint from you. | I'm going to Vegas. - You going to Vegas? When? - When's my suede jacket ready? - Tuesday. | - Wednesday. - Will you place some bets for me? - Yeah. | - All right, I'll call you Tuesday. - Yeah. - All right. - Good morning, Dan. - Good morning. - 'Morning. Dan Mahowny. - These audits can be a pain; we | will try staying out of the way. - Uh, I was in audits myself. - So you know the drill? - Yeah. How long do | you think it'll take? - Ten days. Maybe eight. - So, ten days of this? - Maybe eight. - It's late this year, isn't it? - The blizzard? - No, the audit. Everyone's so jumpy. - Well, it has to be done, Blin. - There's something missing here. The Oskaner file. I only have a statement | and one memo. - Dan tends to handle | that one himself. - Hmm. - No manager's approval, no details of security. This... client doesn't even | seem to have an address. - Ah, the phantom. - Excuse me? - I can't help you. You're gonna have to ask Dan | about Oskaner. - There's one audit I heard about, | out west. The bank's only security system | was an alarm that rang in the hotel next door. | - Did they test it? - Uh, of course. - What happened? - The waiter showed up | with a tray of beer. Ah, well. - About the uh, Oskaner account. - What do you need to know? - There's no way I can pass this. - For what reason? - For a start, he's way over his credit limit. | No authorization... - It was paid off. | - It was? In full. He sold bonds today. - Well, fine. That's that one done. I'm really trying to motor, | here, you know? We're two branches behind. - Whatever I can do to help. - No pressure, Dan. We are looking for a strike. Straight down the middle. Oh, Dan! Oh, Dan! Oh, Dan, no! - Not so bad! - Okay, folks, uh... I gotta go. - No! We were gonna | treat you both at Swiss Chalet! - Swiss Chalet? Oh, I love | Swiss Chalet. I'm sorry. - Oh, it's okay. - All right. Can I count on you, sir, | to make sure the little lady gets home safe? - I think we can manage that. You go off and do | what you have to do. - Thank you, sir. | See you at home. - Don't you even want | to know the scores? - Sir, check your pockets? - Wow. - Sir, step over here, please. Arms up to the side. Okay, go ahead. - We're landing in Philadelphia | very shortly. Might have left the snow | in Toronto, but you don't wanna know what the weather's like | down there right now. - Hey, man. You looking | for a ride? - I can take care of you. - No, thank you. - Come on, man. You wait | all night for a cab? I'm ready to roll, man. - Why are we on the highway? - I need to make a stop. | - No stops! - It's kind of an emergency. - I... I don't care if it's | an emergency, no stops! - Open the door. Hey, come on! Come on! What are you doing, man? | What are doing? Hey! Hey! Gimme my car back, man! - Let me take care | of your travel. Starting tonight. - Too many people around | here know I carry cash. I don't like it. I don't like people | knowing my business. I don't like it. - We can solve this | problem very easily. All you have to do is take | the funds to your bank, and they'll wire it | through to our bank into an American account. - There'd be personal | I.D. Requirements, tax stuff. No. - I'll look into alternatives. - Excuse me, Mr. Foss. - Oh boy. Lock up the money. - Hey, where's he going? - Hey, you're not playing tonight, | Mr. M? - Sure, I'm gonna play, Bernie. I, uh, just needed some air. - Yeah. - I've never been out | here before, so... - Well, uh, you know, that's | on account of the windows. See, the glass is tinted, | so it always looks dull outside. - Hmm. - You know, some dude told me | they pump in oxygen. Keep you guys high. - Huh. That makes sense. - Yeah. - Right? - He's on the boardwalk. - It so happens that Vegas maintains | an account in Canada. Name of Sunshine | Clearing Corporation. - Sunshine Clearing Corporation? - Has a nice ring to it, | don't you think? - All right, the deposit | has to be in my name. - Or an associate's. Just let us know, | bring him down, he signs the money over to you at the cage. - All right, what if... | what if my associate's in Vegas? Could he sign for it | at the cage in Vegas? - Yeah, of course, Dan. No problem. - I'll be making a transfer to your Sunshine Clearing | Corporation account this afternoon. - Okay. - It's for my own use, but I need to release 40,000 | to an associate in Vegas by the name of Frank Perlin. - Frank Perlin. | Okay, that'll be fine. Uh, Mr. Perlin will have to sign | for the whole amount and we'll credit the rest to you | here in sunny Atlantic City. - Are there any other - ahem - | details we should cover? - No, we'll take care | of everything, Mr. Mahowny. Thank you for calling. - Thank you. - We have a problem | with the Selkirk account. - What's the... | what's the problem? - I don't know. Briggs has called a meeting | with Dana and her father at Selkirk International, | he wants you to be there. - Why are they doing this, Alex? I mean, no one except Dan | has seemed even remotely interested | in this project. We go slightly over our loan, and they're calling | my goddamn father in! - It is highly irregular. We're barely half a million over. - She's, uh... how far over, exactly? - Just under five million. - Five million. - Mm-hm. - Already. Incredible. - So you want to give her | a tighter line of credit? - Absolutely not. - The Inspection | Department wants to classify the loan as risky? - No, we are here, gentlemen, to try and force her father | to guarantee the loan. If he does, I want her to borrow every cent | we can lay our hands on. It's a bit of a gamble, but... let's not talk numbers. A few million won't mean much to a man like Selkirk. I'm afraid we now consider | the projections to be rather... optimistic. - In what way? - Mr. Briggs is referring | to the, uh... failure of the original membership plan... | - Failure... - Which was based on tax benefits, | which have now been withdrawn. - But our new marketing strategy's | becoming very successful. As you know. - I appreciate the fact that the bank has a big stake | in this project. I'm surprised it hasn't voiced it's concerns earlier. But I am willing to provide | additional security for Dana's project, if it'll get the damn thing | up and running. - Well done, Mahowny. Get the paperwork ready before | he changes his mind, would you? - Yeah? Mahowny's coming down | with, uh... 1.4 million. They just got the transfer. Only, it's, uh... it's made out to an associate, | name of, uh, Perlin? He's meant to sign | the money over in Vegas. - So? - Uh, well, apparently, | there's, uh... there's no Perlin in Vegas to sign. - What?! | - They've been holding a room for him, but he hasn't shown. Mahowny's going apeshit. - Who is this Perlin? | His business partner? - I don't know. | I don't know anything about Mahowny, | except if we don't get his money to him tonight, | then we may not get it tomorrow. - This is the guy from Toronto | who plays flat out and you don't know his story? | - I don't want to know his story. - Are you saying we could be | facing a serious judgement call? - Only if we know what we don't. - Where is this Perlin? - Toronto. - So fly him down; | he can sign off here. - Mahowny's already run that | by him. He says it's out of | the question tonight. - If the transfer's in his name, Perlin's got to sign off | at the cage. - That's the bottom line? - That's the bottom line. I'm sorry, gentlemen. - How about this? What about we just take the cage - not the actual cage, but the | personnel and the paperwork - and fly it to Toronto? - What are you trying to say? - Perlin signs off at the cage, | at the airport, in Toronto. I told you, | I'm not flying anywhere till my new | suede jacket's ready. - You don't have to fly anywhere. - You can collect tonight | at the airport. - But it's not Monday. - I know. It... Meet me at the executive | terminal at six. - Executive terminal? - By the rental-car place, okay? At six? - I'll think about it. - The call came from | 500 Temperance Street. - Mahowny? - Yeah. They're in deep, | him and Perlin. - How deep you figure? - I don't know, but deep. - What about this airport drop-off? You heard anything | like that before? - No, but ten bucks says | were onto a drug deal. - No bet. - Wimp. - Hi. - Hi? - Hi. - I didn't know if you were | on the phone or... - Come in. - Where'd you sleep last night? - In the car. - I didn't want to disturb you. - But I thought we had | an agreement. I thought it was... | it was going to be different. That's what you said, right? - You think we got problems, Blin? Take a look at Mexico's | foreign debt. - We do have a problem, Dan! And you are not giving | yourself a chance! - Blin, please. - Or me! - Keep your voice down. - What would you do | if you were me, Dan? Just tell me that. You expect me to just... to sit back and watch you throw | your career down the drain, not to mention our relationship? - All right, we'll talk | about this tonight. - We both know I'm not | gonna see you tonight. I got you this. I mean, I figured | if you were gonna... if you're gonna stay out | all night, you know, you might as well keep warm. - A winter coat. - I won't see you tonight? - Honey, this is great. - Will I? - Blin, listen... - No. No, I'll listen when you | have something to say, Dan. - Hey! - New car? - You like? It's got a TV, in the back. - It's got a TV? - Yeah, in the back. | What the fuck we doing out here? - I'm heading down to Atlantic City. - So what do you want, a kiss | goodbye? Give me the money. - It's in the terminal. - You got it | in one of those lockers? Hey, you got a new coat. - Yeah, it's from my girlfriend. - Yeah, it's nice. | Why do you walk around looking like a douche bag | all the time for? - Some girls go for that, Frank. - Not where I come from. | Where you going? - I forgot a bag. Better to have one | to go through customs. - Where you going? | - It's all right! - How much for the bags? - They're free to customers. - Great. Can I have one? - You're not a customer, sir. - Okay. How much for the bags? - Five bucks? - Five bucks... Man, that's nuts, | you give them away for free. - Five bucks. - What are these two clowns up to, | you figure? - What are you trying | to do to me, Dan? - Getting you your 40 grand. - "I hereby release all funds | under the name Frank Perlin to be paid to Dan Mahowny?" - Hey, just... trust me. - There's no amount here. You want me to sign it? - Yes, you sign it and then, you get the 40 grand. - All done? - Okay, uh... just a second. - The dame, she looks | like Tina Turner! - Good night, ladies. - Good night. - Have a good trip. - I never gamble myself, personally. Well, I just don't see | the attraction in it. Well, winning, I guess. But there isn't much | of that, is there? If there was, I'd be out of a job. If you... if you don't mind | me saying. - Hey, you win and lose. Every time you play, | there's plus and minus. Always. - Is that a fact? - That's a fact. - Well, Toronto sure looks | like a nice place. We... we saw Niagara falls on the way over. | It was just fantastic. - I've never been. - You've never been? | How come you've never been? - I guess I don't want to use up | all of Canada too soon. - Seven, nine, five, six... I wanna know who chartered that | flight and where he's going. - Dan! An honour, as always. An honour and a pleasure. - Okay. - Detective Murdoch, New Jersey | State Police Department. We want to see a patron | reference card for a Frank Perlin. - Perlin? We don't have one. - How about Dan Mahowny? - This means the deposit | was 360,000, and this is a deposit | of 620,000. - $620,000 cash? - That's correct. - And 1.4 million today? - By transfer. - Will you look at this? The iceman's playing | 70,000 a hand. - He's bust the table! - What? - Holy shit. - Ben, are you there? - Yeah, go. - They got nothing on Perlin, | but Mahowny's in Atlantic City betting tens of thousands | of dollars a hand. He's known there. He lost millions there, Ben. - He's, uh, he's gambling? - Big time! The guy says it's | like the Super Bowl in there. Ben, you still there? - Yeah, I'm still here. - So what do you wanna do? - What do I wanna do? I think I wanna get a couple | of cars out here and catch me a bank thief, | is what I wanna do. - We're looking for an eight. | Shake an eight. Shoot out. Eight! Frontline winner! - Crap returns. Okay, we're looking | for an eight. Shoot out. Eleven! - Mr. M? - Yeah. - I gotta say something. - What's that? - Listen, you gotta pick up | right now and just walk out. - Oh, I can't do that, Bernie. - Sure you can! | - No, I can't do that. - Look, you did it. | You've got 'em by the balls. I'm telling you, man. Please, just pick up and walk. Right now. - Bernie, I just got here. - Eight. Mark it. Nine... - Same good shooter, coming out. | Come on, come on. - Eight! Frontline winner! - Why is he stopping? - He never stops. - He's not playing. Victor, I swear, if this guy | walks with nine million... - You wanna know how we're doing? Talk to me at 4 a.m. - Your dice, Mr. M. - Three. Craps, finally. - Okay, Eddie craps returns. We're looking for an eight. | Shake an eight, shoot up. Three. Craps, finally. Mr. M... Mr. M! - They're gonna love you in Vegas. - Uh, Bernie, I've | never tipped you. - Uh, no, you're money's no good | here, Mr. M. You know that. - No, take it. - Thank you, sir, but, uh... | no thank you. - You're not the casino, Bernie. This is for you. - I appreciate it, but... I mean, I can't, sir. You know, I'm real sorry | you lost all that money, Mr. M. - Thanks, Bernie. - Sure is a real nice coat | you got there. Is it from the missus? - You take care of yourself, Dan. - You too, Mr. Foss. - I know you didn't get to eat, so... ribs, no sauce | and a Coke, right? - Yeah. Thank you. - Goodbye, Dan. God bless. - See you soon. - Oh, Mr. M., your bag. - Thank you, Bernie. Bernie? - Yes, Mr. Foss? - This time, you really are fired. - I wanna find out where he's | going before we move in on him. Aw, Jesus Christ! I thought I said a couple of cars. - It's kind of been a slow night. - What do you think we're waiting | for, Butch Cassidy? - Hello. Dan? Dan, you okay? - Oh, I'm fine. Blin... I was just thinking, you know, you wanna go see Niagara Falls | some time? I guess you've been | before, but... - All right, take him. - Put your hands | out of the window. Get out of the car, please. - Is there a problem? - Turn around and put | your hands on your head. Put your hands behind you. You're being charged with | suspicion of theft of over $200. - You got a gambling problem, | right? - No. No, sir. - Come on! You didn't get a buzz out of it? - I have a... financial problem, a shortfall. - Ten-point-two? Million dollars? - Approximately. - Who else was in on it, huh? - No one. - You expect us to believe that? - I had a lot of luck. A whole lot of luck. - At the bank, | but not at the tables. - Dan Mahowny? Oh, no. It's quite impossible. - How do you know him? - From the track. - You do business with him? - Do I do business with him? | Um... do you ever sign bank drafts | presented to you by Mahowny? - What are you asking | about him for? What about me? - I wonder if his diet | had anything to do with it? - Dana! Well, I guess you've got the perfect excuse | to change banks now. - Are you kidding? I finally got | something out of those assholes. In fact, let's go down | and put up bail. - Dana, I don't think that's | such a good idea. - Get away from the car. There's nothing to see here. - I'm sorry they suspended, you, Blin. | They shouldn't have done that. How many others? - Thirteen. - Thirteen? Including Bill Gooden? - No, not Bill. - Oh, good. - But he is taking early retirement. - What have I done? To all those people. - You want me to pull over? It's all right. You need to just relax. You wanna turn on the radio? The victory | again last night: 26-18 against the Eskimos. Tiger Cats won a squeaker | against Ottawa in 23 to 22 by a field goal | with three seconds on the clock. The Argonauts | steamrolled the Allouettes 46 to 7 in a game Montreal | would really like to have back. Listen, you can't go through | the rest of your life... not being able to listen | to sport scores. - You're right. - And you know... I really love you. - I love you too. - How would you rate the thrill | you got from gambling on a scale of one to 100? - Um... A hundred. - What about the biggest thrill you've ever had | outside of gambling? - Twenty. - Twenty? How do feel about living | the rest of your life with a max of 20? - Okay. Twenty's okay.
