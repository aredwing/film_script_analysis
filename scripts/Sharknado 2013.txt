My associates and I are willing to negotiate, a reasonable price. Let's say, 100,000. One million for the entire take, Not a penny less. A steep price for a small catch. A pod of 20,000 sharks are migrating in this direction. When we're through with it, One million will look like a bargain. If you're looking to negotiate, Mr. Palmer, look for an insurance salesman. I do believe we have a deal. All hands on deck. All hands on deck. Tie the sails! Get the fins to the gally! Captain there is a north wind hitting us fast! You need to get up here. I think this is for you captain. The deposit. You'll receive the rest when we dock. You know the most important thing I learned out here? We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks. They are the ones that should be afraid of us. Salud. What the hell is that? They're called waves. They do that from time to time. The storm is too strong. We are going to have to go around it. Make it happen. I'm going down below. Captain! Change of plans Captain. I'm going to take the money, your cargo, and what's left of the ship. Aah! I don't think so. Crazy waves out there today. Something unnatural about it. There's something unnatural about everything. Lots of scenery today. I'm gonna focus on the waves. You better hurry mate. The clouds are coming in. Whoo! Reminds me of the nationals in 04. Remember? You totally ripped that bugger. I thought you were going to be rag dolled for sure. You know we really don't talk like that, right? You doing a ride-out or not? Sure. Thanks. It's totally cooking out here mate. You're not kidding. It's a Mexican hurricane. Bad for them good for us. Isn't that a drink? Hit. Hit! Whoo! Good Morning California this is Joni Waves. That's Joni with with an "I". You may have noticed this morning the unusual weather here in Southern California. The clouds coming in over the ocean and the large waves are proving difficult for surfers. I'm here in Santa Monica with some breaking news about Hurricane David. It's been pounding the west coast of Mexico. Pushing it's way up to the coast to the state of California. It seems to be driving a very dangerous surf. No kidding. Fin's out there. Yeah but I won't worry about Fin, I mean he's the best surfer I've ever seen. Except for me of course. In my prime. When was that George? The Civil War? Eh, I'm not that old. You know I got some moves babe... Hey! What did I tell you? You can touch everything at this bar except for me. Hey! Come on! Oopsies! Looks like you need another drink. Yeah a free one. One on the house. One that doesn't cost me any money. How come you never talk about that scar, right there on your leg? There's nothing to talk about. I cut myself shaving. 4 bucks. 4 Bucks? I thought it was on the house. You spilled the last one. Perhaps the silver lining of the storm is that it has driven away the recent influx of sharks in our area... Yeah I hope it does. Hope it does. I hope the storm kills'em. I hope it kills them all. Me too. You have no idea. Tired already? What's the last time you short boarded, old timer? I never stopped. I just like the way this one rides. Yeah. Whatever. Alright grandpa. I'm gonna show you how it's done. Grandpa? Show her how it's done, Grandpa! Come on. Oh! Deanna there's a shark! Hey get outta the water! SHARKS! Hey Get out of the water! Sharks! They're coming in! Get off the beach! Get out of the water! Sharks! Get out of the water! SHARKS! Everyone out of the water, right now! Everyone out of the water now! We're evacuating the beach. Everybody off the beach immediately. Aaah! Come here you bloody shark! Come on! Aaah! Baz! Baz! Aaah! Just hang on. I'm gonna get you in. These sharks of yours have no etiquette. Etiquette? I thought you were Australian not British. Tasmanian buddy. Just hang on, I'll get you in. What were you thinking? You could have been killed. I'm fine. Aah! We need a tourniquet. Here use this. It's just a-aah! Little nibble. Aah! Are you okay? Are you sure? He must have wanted a snack. Sharks don't like vegemite. It's not funny. Aah. Hey. You gonna be okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Hey can I get some of those tasty nuts. Thank you. And then. Are you listening? The shark opens it's mouth. Goes to swallow Fin whole but Fin looks at the shark. Do the look. No, do the look. Oh my God. Yeah that one. And the shark goes, 'You know what?' I'm pissing off. I'm not gonna mess with the world champion surf legend, Finley the Fin Shepard. Ain't that right? On you mate. I don't believe it. You guys are nuts. Look. Do you see that? - Oh yeah. - It's a little nibble. So he gives him a look and you give him a nibble... No, HE gave me a nibble. I don't know. Are you guys going back out there and doing any swimming? With the sharks? It's a storm. It's what's driven them all up north. Eventually they'll go back from where they came from. I hope. But the were knocking. Yeah, knock, knock, knocking on your door. And I never seen so many of them, or so bold. It's just a storm. Just gotta stay out of the water for a couple days that's all. Just a storm? Looks like a hurricane. I'm just happy you're okay. Hey, hey, what are you doing? What? Do you think you're too old for me? No, I'm your boss. So? So? Go get back to work. Hey! I'm not too old for ya. I don't think. I'm not your boss. Daddy issues. Hey! I'm not judging you darlin'. Ouch! I have daddy issues too. - Here to issues. - Yeah! Who's is this? Hurricane David is poised to be the first hurricane to hit the state of California. And it is now barreling toward the Santa Monica shorelines. We have suffered tropical storms in the past but we have never been hit by a storm quite like this. Wide spread flooding is expected and experts are saying global warming is the reason for this unprecedented event. We will be back with more news as it develops. Hello. Wexler residence. April it's Fin. Yeah Fin I know your voice. What do you want? Look I'm just calling to make sure... When did you go back to using Wexler again? Cause that's my name. Look Fin I'm really busy. Just calling to make sure you and Claudia are okay. There's a bad hurricane rolling in and I want... Is this about money? Because if this is about money Fin, I told you already that... It's the storm. I just want to make sure guys are okay. Of course we're okay. It's barely even raining. Look, it's really sweet that you are calling in to check in on us but Collin already checked the drains and, we're gonna be fine. They're cleared out. Well it's flooding here and not the plumbing. The ocean. I think you guys should get out of town. What are you talking about? We are 100 miles from the ocean. You are exactly 6.6 miles from the ocean. And on a day like today it's not far enough. I'm gonna take you and Claudia further inland. And what about Collin? You know you are not the only one that can keep us safe. We're not going anywhere. Fine. Then just let me get Claudia. We'll make it my week for the month. Is that what this is about? No! Look you are gonna see her on the 20th like you always do. I gotta go okay. Bye Fin. Who's that? My wife. That is his wife. - Yeah his wife. - Shut up Baz. Alright everybody, listen up. I'm closing the restaurant. Storm is coming and it's coming fast. Get home safe everybody. Don't forget taco Tuesdays. George, you got to get out of here. What's going on? If I don't secure the bar, I'm going to loose everything. Come on George, George wake up. Oh! I hear an angel, I must be in heaven. George you better wake up or I'm calling in your bar tab. Oh, I'm up, I'm up. Hey hey, you need to go home. I'm not going anywhere. This is not your problem. No! It is my problem. Because if this bar get blown over then I'm out of a job too. Yeah, and I'm not gonna have any place to drink. Can't argue with that one. For an environmentalist you sure do hate sharks. I've got fire power behind the bar. Come on, come on! Alright, grab a weapon. Grab anything you can find to defend yourself. Give me something dangerous. Can I get one for the road Fin? Huh? What? Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! George get your ass up! Now! Alright. Come on kid. Don't you ever make fun of my stool again. Come on come on. Shoot it! That's what you get for trying to eat me. Come on, come on guys, let's go. We are here live at the Santa Monica Pier, this is what remains after the massive storm tore through the popular attraction. The waves also brought in sharks which have injured dozens and killed several people. We'll rebuild mate. Insurance will cover it. L.A. wasn't built for this much water. I'm really worried about Claudia and April. I gotta check on them. I'll come with you. April doesn't like you, remember? Nah mate. She doesn't like you, remember? She loves me. Where do you think Claudia came from? Who's Claudia? His daughter. You have an ex-wife and a daughter? I can drop you at home if you want? I live on the beach it's obviously flooded. No where else to go. Looks like we're all refugees now. I wanna go with you. Make sure your family is okay. Anybody seen George? George? Here he is. Oh man. I'm glad you woke me up. I was having the worst nightmare. Gosh the water is rising. Water is not going to be a problem. All the electronics have been sealed with silicone. We'll be fine. I've driven this thing on the beaches from here to Costa Rica. Why is the car shaking. What the hell. There are sharks on the streets. These fish surely have a hankering for me. It's like one taste of Baz just isn't enough. Hey whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up with the guns. We don't need more blood in the water. That's a tiger shark. How do you know that? Shark Week. Where'd it go? Where did it go? Ah geez. Hey. It's under the car. Well can I start shooting now? Yeah. Do it. We got to get to higher ground. Take the freeway. It's way above street level. You take the 10 to the 405. You're almost in Beverly Hills. And then there is no way the ocean has washed inland that far. What makes you an expert on Beverly Hills George? That's where I live. George if you live in Beverly Hills why do you come all the way to the coast to come and drink at my bar? I don't know. I like the view, you know. There's the beach. There's all these scantily clad women there that pretend to like me if I buy them a drink. And there is my seat. My chair. My chair is always there. Plus you don't charge 15 dollars a plock. Yeah. Plus there is the beautiful Nova there who I plan to marry soon. I sit around and think about it every night and day. Everywhere I go. Fin! Hey! Bloody hell. That's the 405. I hate the 405. What are these idiots doing? Yeah I'll just go around them. You need to back up. I need to get out of here! Get back in your car. It's not safe out here. It's just a little water. Typical Californians are afraid of the rain. Yeah. Stop! Watch it will ya. Oh my God. It's like Old Faithful. We're gonna need faith to get through that. The water is rising behind us. What, what, what? Oh my God! I just can't sit back and watch this. - What? - The sharks are swimming right at them. They're not gonna make it. Don't even think about it. They're not gonna make it. Fin! Where you going? The sharks are falling from the freakin' sky. Here we go again. Nova! There's sharks out there. You don't have to go out there. There's absolutely no reason to go out there. Everyone needs to get to higher ground! Puppy! Somebody help me! Help me get my dog out! Please help me! My dog is locked inside. This area is flooding. Come on, get out! Please! Please help! Somebody help! Okay. You go! Okay. I got you princess come on. There you go. Come on George. George! Come on George! Oh crap! Ouch! Get off of me! It's not gonna end. The flood channels, the storm drains, the sewers. It's not gonna stop at the coast. They're going to swim everywhere. Come on get in the car. We've got to go through this. What? You've got kangaroos loose in the brain mate. We can't go through that. The aerodynamics in this car cannot match the waves. The waves are only gonna get bigger when the storm get closer. Trust me, if there is one thing I know, it's timing waves. That's what I was afraid of. They come in sets of 3. One. Two. Three. Whoo. Everybody okay? - I'm all right. - 10 fingers. 10 Toes. Uh, gotta love L.A. What are these people thinking? Nothing. Flooding is rampant through out the L.A. basin. We've had unsubstantiated reports of sharks swimming in the streets and falling from the skies! Does April know you're coming? No. But at least we'll be in the hills away from the flooding. Alright. It's awfully nice of you to let her new boyfriend stay in your house. Don't remind me. Unbelievable. We're almost at the house. That's too bad. I was hoping it was further up the hill. April! April! Hey let us in. No! What are you doing here? And what happened to him? Nothing. Your Fin saved my life. He's not my Fin anymore. And who is she? It's Nova. She works at the bar. Now will you let us in. No! I told you not to come. No! Just go away. Take your little stripper friend and Baz and leave. Nice shot. By the way I'm not a stripper. Claudia! She doesn't want to talk to you. Claudia! Dad? What are you doing here? There's a big storm coming in. It's not safe here. I'm not going anywhere with you. Just leave. I didn't come here to argue with you. - I don't care. - I came here to get you. What is all the ruckus? Oh, Sheppard. Should have figured it was you. What are you doing here? L.A. is drowning. I'm going inland. I'm taking my family with me. Finley. April is mine. Excuse me? My girlfriend is not your responsibility. And unless it's the 20th of the month, which currently it's not. Neither is Claudia. Collin, don't be rude. He's just worried about us. Every time it rains in L.A. everyone swears it's the storm of the century. And even if it is, Beverly Hills Emergency Services are second to none. We're safe here. There are sharks flooding the streets. And now there's one swimming in your pool. Are you kidding? Sharks in the swimming pool is impossible... Collin! Something's on my foot! Finley! Help me! Finley! Watch out! Collin! Help me! It's getting away! Collin! I've got your back. Get it's nose. Die already! It's coming back! - No! - Oh my gosh! Fin! Ready? Fin! Where'd it go? Where'd it go? - Go, go, go! - Oh my gosh! Fin hurry up, get over here. Nice shot. Thanks. Looks like it's that time of the month. Look! We're out of Ammo. The eye of the storm still hasn't come to shore yet. It's gonna get worse before it gets any better. We got to get inland and we got to get some place safe for all of us. Where? I'm thinking the desert. No, we have to go to Van Nuys to get Matt. Matt's in flight school there. Matt's at flight school? I thought he was vacationing in Tampa with his buddies. When did this happen? I just talked to him. How come nobody tells me these things. I'm suppose to be included in these conversations. He wanted to tell you but, Collin said it was none of your business anymore. Who's Matt? My brother. You have a son too? Alright. We got to get out of here quick. How are we going to do that? I'm going to push the shark out of here. I'm gonna distract it. When I do this, get to the car as fast as you can. Now! He'll be okay. Fin! Come on, get in! Move it! Move your ass! Go, go, go! Easy come, easy go. The eye of Hurricane David is continuing it's relentless pounding through the streets of Los Angeles. And most surprisingly and most shocking reports have been pouring in from all over, that sharks have been washing ashore. Live sharks. And not only from the coastal flooding but they are coming up through the drains and sewage systems of the city of Los Angeles. Nothing like this has ever... Do you always have this much ammo in your jeep? Semper Paratus. Dad, are you really saying that right now. Can't you be serious? It means? Always be prepared. Thank you. I always thought it would be an earthquake that would be the end of Los Angeles. Or a meteor shower. Zombies even. Yeah. Black Plague. Aliens. But sharks? Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Go figure. My luck, sharks. Yeah your luck. Sharks. Mine too. I'm not gonna lie. It's kinda hot when you do that. Again we will keep you updated on this storm. This is Joni Waves. That's Joni with an "I" - Call Matt. This is the emergency alert system. National weather service has issued a tornado warning throughout Los Angeles County. Water spouts have been detected in the coastal water from Orange... No kidding. You are a bit late on that one. We got to get out of here fast. We got to go get Matt. The freeways will be a nightmare. But there's a short cut if you turn right up here. That's how I always get around the Hollywood traffic with my friends. What are you doing in Hollywood? Since when do you care? Hold on. The storm is dying down. How can you tell? Not as many sharks flying around. Why you stopping. We have to go get Matt. Don't you see that? There could be kids in there. There's no one in there. And your kid is right here. We got to get her somewhere safe. This is so typical of you Fin. You care more about other people then you do your own family. Let's go! Please. I can't. The water is rising. I'm going to go up to the bridge and rappel down. Fin this is crazy. Calm down guys. Calm down, okay. There's other grown ups coming, okay? Uh uh, Police Department, Fire Department. They're going to get us out of this. As long as we stay in here we are going to be fine, okay? Trust me. We're gonna be just fine. Anybody in there? Whoa! Whoa! Be careful. Need a lift? I'm glad to see you. Send the rope. I reached dispatch right before all the electronics went out. They said someone from 911 is sending someone over. Oh yeah? Want to wait for them? Hell no! I didn't think so. Who's first? Okay, come over here honey. Alright Samantha you're going to be all right. Start pulling, they're ready. Alright you ready? Just keep looking up. It's gonna be fine Samantha. Here we go. Okay, lift her up! Alright here we go Samantha you're going to be all right. Go ahead. It's gonna be just like flying. Come on, come on. Quicker, let's go. Yes! Yes! Alright pull'em up! You're doing all right. You're doing good. Don't be afraid. Come on. Hold on tight. - He's up. - Okay. Alright. Alright, who's next? A bunch of little kids went up before me. How hard can it be right? - Let's go. - Alright. Go over there. Come on sweetheart. Your dad is trying to do good here. Give him a hand. Are you sure this thing is strong enough to hold me? Nope, I'm not. Great. I'm sure not looking forward going in there after you. Yeah. I hate sharks. I'm from Wyoming. You know... I moved down here to be an actor. Dad. I got to go up right now! Please! Up, up, up! Come on! Oh God! 15 grand a year. No benefits. Screaming kids. Calm down. It's okay. Don't Panic. I used to hate heights. Now, I'm away from sharks. This is great. Okay, let's do this now before I become hot lunch. Watch out Fin! Watch out to the right. Watch out! Oh my gosh be careful. Watch your foot. Hurry, come on, faster. Oh my gosh! Be careful! Be careful Fin! Watch out! Fin come on! Watch out Fin! I've had just about enough of you. Be careful Fin! Come on. Your okay. Oh my gosh. Finny, look at the sky. The storm is clearing up. Maybe it's done. Good. These guys are gonna get you home, okay? Be safe. Oh crap. What? Claudia get in the Jeep! I'm fine mom. Get down! Get down! You all right? You okay? My mom always told me Hollywood would kill me. Start the engine. Is that good? Okay, rev it. Rev it. Guys it's flooding. It's gonna be easier if we steal another car. Then steal another car. There's a small gas leak but it should run for now. What is that? It's a water spout. Tornado over the ocean. Water gets sucked up into the air... Are those sharks? Yeah. Come on. Come on. Close her up. Let's go. Well, at least the rain is easing up a bit. What was that? Oh my God. Oh my God. What the hell? Kill it! This is crazy! Hit the breaks! Get down Claudia! - This is unbelievable. - Hold the wheel. Hold onto the wheel. - Okay. - Bloody hell! Why did we stop? It must be flooded. Well fix it! Mate I smell gas. I do too. Come on, get out of the car! Get out of the car! Go, go, go! The gun! Well, at least the rain is easing up a bit. Can I use you phone please? It's been dead for hours. Thanks. No problem. So what kinda name is Nova anyway? That's the kinda name you give yourself when you don't like the person you use to be. Hey, uh. Look, I see the way you that you look at my dad. He's just gonna break your heart, like he did to my mom and I. It looks like the eye of the storm is over. Or maybe not. Hey make it quick. I don't want to spend too much time here. With these storms ravaging the streets of Los Angeles, some religious officials are referring to this as the opening signs of the impending apocalypse. Apocalypse my ass. This isn't the end of the world. Gods, they're not angry with us. The Aliens aren't coming down. It's the government. Ye-ah. With the big capital G. They're behind everything. They know what we buy. They know what we eat. Where we go to the bathroom. Hurry. Hurry. They know what kinda cheese I like. Pepper Jack. They control it all and the weather too. I gotta hand it to them though, Sharks? I never saw that coming. Y-eah. Weather satellites are currently tracking 3 off shore water spouts over the Pacific Ocean. Experts are categorizing this as an EF4. With a potential to becoming an EF5 tornado by the time it touches down on land. In the San Fernando Valley all roads are blocked and movement... Protein. I know how we're going to get out of here. You know we need a car first. I've got it covered. Oh nice! You're gonna need stitches and antibiotics. And you're gonna have a hell of a scar. That's okay. Chicks dig scars, right? Why are you driving so fast? We got to get there fast before they clear the accident. What accident? Something I saw on the news. Look out! Whoa! This is nuts. Now we're never gonna get to Van Nuys. - Baz, drive around it. - I can't. It's blocked in every direction. We got to get Matt before the storm picks up again. I'm going for it. - Are you crazy! Don't do it. - Go! Go! Go! Whoo! Pull your car over. Dad! The police are chasing us. - Hey Baz. - Yeah. Stop your vehicle now! Drive faster. No worries mate. Fast enough for ya? Yeah. Pull to the side of the road. Stop your vehicle now. Hey Baz, is that a nitrous button? - It certainly is mate. - What do you say we hit that? - Give it a go. - Hold on folks. Hold on to your panties ladies. Oh man! Whoo! Now this is fun. I think we lost them. Now, we're talking. Okay. It should be smooth sailing from here. Why is there a retirement home next to an airport? Because old people can't hear. It doesn't look like they've left. Their cars are still here. I'm gonna go look upstairs. Okay. I'll check these rooms. Matt? Matt? Has anybody seen anything? Matt? Matt? It's time to leave Kansas, mate. There's no one up here. Where is everyone? Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! No, no, no. I'm looking for Matt. Is there a Matt here? Matt? Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm Matt. Who are you? Guys I found Matt com on. Come here. He's in here. Matt! Dad? Mom? What are you guys doing here? We had to come inland to avoid the storm. - We came in to get you. - There's sharks everywhere. Sharks? Is this the best shelter you got? Look, we don't exactly have a storm cellar. We better find something to protect ourselves and quick. From what? They couldn't possibly make it all the way out here. They can. It's entirely possible. A hurricane can pick up marine life out of the ocean and drop it hundreds of miles away. Hold this. Yeah, he's right. It happened once near Alice Springs. 100s of perch fell from the sky. Why not Sharks? Look, what the hell is going on here? It's a Sharknado! Let's get inside here. Get in, get in. The news said that there's 3 tornadoes in the area. We're not safe here. What's the fastest way to get out of here? Can that fly? I don't know. Let me check. Looks pretty beat up. Hey you know what? She'll fly. We're not all gonna fit in here. We can't fly in these storms. Then what are we gonna do? We're going to stand and fight? We can't just wait here and wait for... sharks to rain down on us again. We need to arm ourselves with something more powerful then these. What were you thinking? That store's got everything we need. Semper Paratus. They must have evacuated. How are we getting in? Guys stand back. I have the key. Dad, I'll be right back. I have an idea. Come with me. Oh nice! This is what I'm talking about. Hey, do you think you can make this work? Yeah. I'll make it work. Good. - Bombs. - Bombs? Instead of letting live sharks rain down on people, we're going to get in that chopper and throw bombs into the tornadoes. Blasting those bastards to bits. I like it, but how is that gonna stop a tornado? Tornadoes happen when cold and warm air meet. Now if you drop a bomb head, right in the middle of it, you just might equalize it. But if you miss, we're screwed. Oh, hell no. You got a death wish? No way! Dad, I'm the only one that could do it. Bobby and Luellyn haven't even soloed yet. What's wrong? Your son wants to go into a helicopter and drop a bomb into the tornado. No! It's too dangerous. I'll watch his back. I'll be the bombardier. Then definitely not. Dad, we have a chance to save thousands of lives. Maybe more. You always taught me to help others. I'm going. He's right April. We'll work it out together. I won't let anything happen to him. Don't you understand you can die Matt? Mom, we don't have any other option. And you are not gonna stop me. He certainly is your son. Shopping cart? Yeah. Claude? Claude? Hey! Come on. What are you doing down here? What's the problem? You. You're my problem. Are we really gonna do that now? Now? Look, what are you and mom doing? You guys can barely stand to be in a room together for 5 minutes, and now. What? Cause you're saving Matt you're best friends again? He is my son. I'm your daughter. You guys are always there for him and you're never there for me. Hey get that one. No, no, the other one. You don't think I try? Not hard enough. I came for you first. Try to remember that. Come on. Come on. Hey. I fell off a slide when I was 2. It hurt like hell. Now people think it's cool. Nobody thinks this is cool. What happened? I had a tattoo removed. I don't like to talk about it. I was raised by my grandparents. When I was 7 my grandpa took me fishing on one of those day charter deals with his friends. We wound up hitting into a reef and the boat went down. My grandfather took me and put me inside this little life-raft for safety. Everyone else was kinda just swimming around trying to stay up and suddenly all these sharks just started swarming and... and then they... tried to protect me but... By morning they were all gone. So I floated out there for 2 days until one of those Coast Guard helicopters finally spotted me. I thought I was safe but suddenly this shark leaped up and bit my leg. 6 people went into the water and one little girl came out. The sharks took the rest. They took my grandfather. So I really hate sharks. Now I really hate sharks too. Nice work kids. But this... this is a bomb. Dad, the tornado is coming. Hey! Hey what are you doing? In case things don't work out, We're going to move to plan B. Baz builds a bigger bomb, and drives into the center of the storm. That's not gonna work. It's a one way trip. Especially with that leg. - You want to see me try? - No! Fin, look after your family. They are a good bunch. It's fine. Alright, do what you gotta do. Don't I always? I will. Watch our backs. Be careful. Alright get ready. Do we have enough bombs? Sure hope so. First time in a chopper? Yeah. Scared? Hell no! Oh crap. Look at all those sharks! Look out! More Sharks! What are we gonna do? You got it dad. Oh my God, there's just too many of them! We're gonna need a bigger chopper. - I hope this bomb idea of yours works. - Trust me. It will. - We're getting close. Get Ready. - Ready? - Yeah. Bombs. Bombs. - Bombs. Bombs Bombs Bombs. Careful with those Robert. Alright, here's how you do it. Open the valve. First tornado coming to the left here. Push the button. Hold it for 3 seconds. We're gonna count. Okay. 1. 2. 3. Strike! Whoo! Hahaha. - Whoo! I did it! - Told ya! That worked! Fin! How's the front end looking Bobby? I'm not a captain yet sir. Bobby look out! Get down! The tornado is coming this way. Baz! Second tornado! Second tornado! The tornado is headed towards the airport. We need to destroy it before it gets to them. Why! Baz! Baz! Dad! You have to leave him! It's getting closer. We have to go now or we're dead. OK, tell me when. Come on. Come on. Let's go up there! Okay people, everybody out of the pool. Everybody needs to get out of the pool and inside. Yes Carl that means you. Out now please.
