I've got it! She tried to take her life again? Thank heaven, she's alive. Butcher, I think you've got a customer coming. Who's next? I am! That for me? At your service. Put it on my bill. We know where she keeps her bill alright! Your turn! Carburettor's acting up again. That'll cost you... The ride, plus luggage... How're you paying? Lentils? That's all I've got. Listen... Those shoes there would do the trick... Closed! That's all today. I didn't come for that. Anyway, I don't eat meat. I came about the ad. What ad? In the paper. What paper? "Hard Times". "Light building maintenance. Odd jobs. "Room and board. Southern exposure." It's the right place, number 129A? Here or there, this is nowhere. There's no neighbour hassle! And no visitors. Well... I must've made a mistake. Not so fast! If I got you right, you're looking for a job? Come here. Turn around. Pardon? Turn around! What do you weigh? You're no heavyweight! I've got work. - But it takes muscle. - No problem! I'm a butcher but I don't mince words. You don't seem to be cut out for the job. You don't have the bones, the chest... I'll try you out, but you'll have to bust ass! What a stroke of luck! Thanks. Come on. So what does the work involve? Light building maintenance. Odd jobs. Room and board. Southern exposure. Like in the ad? How about that? Just like the ad! Watch it, there's a loose step. You'll fix it with the rest: paint, electricity, cleaning... The works! You'll like it there. And there're no neighbours opposite. Hang the key there. I'll let you get settled. Thanks. How're things in town? Terrible. With rationing, people'd eat their shoes. It's touchy. They have no smarts. It's a mess. And till things grow back... They'll never grow back. You're no optimist. Get that into your skull, for chrissake! Your hair isn't growing back. Same difference. Can't we open the window 5 minutes? I like the smell of glue. It smells like fish. It brings back memories. What do you think of the new guy? You deaf? He's skinny. Thinking about her again? They say she hears voices now. Is it too much effort to put that closer? Hi! Forget it, she's deaf as a post. If she gets lost, we'll find her. Go back home, there's nothing left. I'm telling you there's nothing left! You finished? Don't stay up there. Fix the 3d floor bulb. - Hi, Butcher! - Hi, Postman! - Got a parcel for your daughter. - Upstairs. - Watch the step. - Mind your business! Go for it, Marcel! Grab it! - I've got it! - Throw it here! You bastard! Postal Administration! Article 12. "You have 20 sec. to scatter and return to your domiciles." Now! You have no kids to feed. That means kids, too! Can't you read, idiot? - "Julie Clapet". - He's a friend. A friend? Here, Julie... Sign here, Julie. I call you Julie because I like you. But I won't rush you. See you soon, Julie. Here... For the ad. At your service. That new guy looks weird. - An ex-circus man! - From the circus? It must be nibbles. That's why they... Would you care to taste them? Yes! I'd love to. Then 7 p.m. at my place, time to prepare. - Say, he after her? - After who? Your girl. She's sure a cute young lady. She needs someone... She's got me! Got that? By the way, I've got news. They shot one down 2 days ago. A superb 30-yard moving target. - No body? - They cart their dead away. Vermin! They say they even eat money. Got to get rid of them for good, see? Those seed-eating faggots... They'll get it, alright! Bye, Butcher! Bye, Postman! Think it's for tonight? I hope so. Goddamn butcher, I know he won't do it tonight. He dawdles just to piss me off! It works! What's he waiting for? For the new guy to escape in a garbage can, too? How long did he last us? A week. Not counting the bouillon. A week! We finished the last chunk 2 days ago. I'm hungry! I have a pit inside! A fucking hell of a pit! My dear Hercules... Every man for himself... It's me. Hi! Come in. Please, come in. This is for you. Thanks. Sit down. Did you paint this? Yes... It's nothing much. That's alright. I made tea. Shall I pour it? Yes, please. I hope you don't find me too forward. Not at all. Why should I? A girl invites you to her home... A bit improper, maybe? Well, actually... I wanted to thank you for this morning. Thank me for what? You rescued my package in the stairs. I was moved by your gesture. It's only natural. But usually, people only think of themselves... these days. It's normal, they have nothing. Deep down, they're good people. I'm glad they like me. They're very kind. Things're fine with your dad, too. I believe he thinks I'm a nice guy. Why not try gourmet cheese spread? That's new! And it's handy. They talk to me about you. Who? The voices in my head. Of course, the voices! What do they say? Let me think... They talk in such a way... Do they talk about love? "Robert is a pervert, an ass-wipe, a panty-eater." See? But that's not true! Aurore, you're missing something hilarious! Anyway, I have no choice. Here... Tomorrow, at 11 sharp. Ring! Don't let me down. "Ass-wipe"? Move out? What for? I've just moved in! it's unsanitary, the walls are crumbling, it leaks... Maybe you don't like me? You act as if you want me to leave... On the contrary! That's not what I meant. It does that sometimes. Did I hurt you? I'm alright. We really clashed. I'm so clumsy. Don't budge. I'm blind as a mole. Everything's foggy. I could get lost in it. Since I break things, I always buy two. You play the cello? I play music, too. Wait, I'll be back. Shit, not again! What're you doing? - I wanted to take a bath. - Again? You sharpen your knives enough! A musical saw! It has a nice sound. Sit down. I used to play it with the doctor. Livingstone... "Dr Livingstone"! He was my partner. It'll rust now that he's gone. Where did he go? He disappeared after a show... We only found his carcass. They ate him. Can you imagine, they ate him! That night, I lost everything. So, the 1st ad I read... And here I am. I must tell you something. Hush... Listen! Do you know that tune? It was his favourite. Notice how the nights are clear? We're entering the Virgo age. That's my sign. - No joke? - I swear it: Virgo, ascendant Leo. Cut it out, not everyone's Gorilla, ascendant Bulldozer! I'm in luck, there's lots in store: "Get ready, the wind's shifting." You'd like to pack up and leave, right? You wouldn't get far. It's worse out there, they draw straws. It'd be a shame to see those hams go. And those little sucklings... Don't joke about that, I hate it. You're better off here. At least, we got a system. My ass! Those helpers you ice are drawing straws, too. That's fate! And you can't help fate. the wind's shifting. Everyone's gonna get it. Mr Louison, I'm not supposed to tell you, but... what happened to your friend happens here. It takes place at night in the stairs. That's why no one goes out. And my father... Soporific herbs Hi! - I'm here for the springs. - Come in. This is an antique! It has seen a lot of use. What's the problem? It squeaks. That's a pain. Could you bounce just a little? I can't see anything. It does it most when there're 2 of us. Let's try it. As I thought, the 2nd spring to the right. Come, Aurore... We are here... to help you... Come... Freed from life... Come with us, Aurore... Soothed... Come at 11 sharp. Ring hard! Rotten world... That should do it. - Here... - Thanks. What are Troglodists? Outlaws. It's the big story, but no one sees them. Tales to keep people busy. A typical Capricorn statement! You lose, I'm Aquarius. The sign of the future! The future... It's soon history around here. It's so easy to miss a step. Don't worry about me. You little brats, give that back! Quit sneering, or I'll whack you one! I'll beat one with the other! Give that back, I won't stand for it! Nice work! Little rugrats, how'll we get it down? This is a job for the Australian! The Australian? Stand back. That's some tool! The Australian is nothing without its master. How about that! So, Tapioca, you find a job? No, not yet. That's bad news, your bill's running up. Not to mention the rent. I'm in a bit of a fix. But I've got some good stuff. Have a look? Black market? You're a louse! But take a look. What's that? A rat-call. That's the female cry. It attracts males. But there're no rats left. And that? That is a bullshit detector. Try it. Try what? Give me some bullshit. Come on! I can't do it on cue. "Life is beautiful." A bullshit of a detector! Turn it off! We can't hear a thing. If you can't pay up, we'll have to find a way. Fast. Otherwise you'll wind up hooked to me. Very funny! What about that clown? He's been around long enough. We're edgy. Don't care! He'll redo the ceilings. Meanwhile, he takes root and we wither away. I have mouths to feed. I bet! The granny's, for instance. Why do you mention her? I know why. What do you mean? Want to pay up? Give up granny. Tonight. Take it easy! She's one of ours. The rules say... The rules... Age limit is a rule, too. She soon won't be good for more than marrow paste. She's my mother-in-law! Take Mrs Interligator, - that's all she wants! - Quit yelling. - It's charity. - Please. Interligator needs his wife. And he's a good tenant he pays! The damn rich always manage. With your debts, you've no choice. Need I insist? It's you, Julie... You scared me. Counting your money again? Yes. Tell me... It's rare to see you here. That's nice of you. Like your gift? It must've cost you. Anything to make you happy. You've loved candy since you were little. But I don't like it anymore. Let him go. You always ask that. It's the same thing each time. No, this time... So it is different. Just look at you! I see his game. Making your head spin with his puppy eyes, his dreams... - There's no room for dreams! - Stop it! It's a tough world, and I didn't make it. You hate my trade. It's an art like any other! Let him go. And you'll go with him? You won't last 2 weeks. And I won't lose you. You lost me long ago! Julie! An underground organization? Hi, girl. Guess what? We'll play a game. I scare you, you scream, and the clown upstairs runs down to your rescue. Shall we start? What's wrong? Don't just stare! Scream, dammit! You come from N.E. sector just to bug us about your Mr Whosit's troubles? Mr Louison. Don't know him! No more names, no more ID's. We're at war. You're with outlaws! He's Rolls. I'm January. Voltange. Rolan. Tourneur. Milan. Trap. Pank. Fox. Paumeau. We watch out for moles, from up there. You could be one! I'm not a liar. It's true! You, a surfacer, talk about truth? Look. Know what this is? The shirt of our brother Matt. Shot point blank like a rabbit. That's truth! Live game, that's what we are. And you're mad predators. - I'm not, I swear! - You're one of them: a meatsucker! Is that the way you talk to ladies in your rat hole? Careful! Oh, my God! Tell Calamity Jane to straighten out or hell 'll break loose. Got it. There's a month's harvest there. Plus the risks involved. - Matt died for that. - Tell her. Corn! There's plenty in my building. What's whosit look like? His name's Louison. The guy we're supposed to grab. May I help you? It's just an old coffee grinder. Coffee? Some have it made! So we went our for a walk last night? A long one, too! There's ruckus, there're screams... This place is really hopping! Your dad may work at night, but still! Oh, Julie! You okay? Sorry, I was rehearsing a new number. Wait! Here... Didn't you hear anything last night? After your herbs, you kidding? A teapot a night, as you prescribed. I'll bring you more, you're almost out. You should drink some, you look overwrought. Cheer up, she died a natural death. Come on. Still, I'd've liked to say goodbye. We'll do that right now. My poor Robert... What made you rush into the stairs at night? I did it for Aurore. I wanted to save her. She wasn't the one who screamed! Anyway... Here! Still, I did it for her. Besides, the butcher was very decent. He apologized. lnvite you to dinner? Well, I haven't much... Fine! We'll feel lighter. Sharp! I'm very punctual. Rather rare for a girl, no? For a girl, you're rather rare! I owe you a lot, you know. Did you forgive? Livingstone? One must always forgive. Depends. It's not always possible. Don't say that. No one is entirely evil. It's circumstance. Or they don't realize they've done wrong. What'd that girl say? The girl! Sector 3/4, 69 N.E. Albumin Square, here! Let's go! Scout to Sauce-Master. Heading to target, 69 N.E. Sauce-Master to Scout, read you, Roger. Watch your steaks, guys! Come, Aurore... They are the Worm, you are the Fruit! Again? Shoot! It's rather quiet. No! Not Father's clubs! Yes, your father's clubs! See who's on TV tonight? - I don't have a TV. - Look! That's your next customer, isn't it? I'll be damned! I've got to take off. No offense, but allow me the right to come back tonight and pay my thoughts to your daughter. Dangerous, what's that? Audacious, we're that! Courageous, I'll take three. Generous, U, U, U and me! corn located at site. I repeat: corn located. - Proceeding with mission, phase B. - Louison. I repeat: target, Louison. An ambush! Aurore, what's wrong now? Georges... Throw in your apron? Now I've heard everything! It's been on my mind a while... We're aging, I'm losing my touch. And so many victims... I feel sorry for them. Sorry? That's not like you at all! No one's entirely evil. It's circumstance. Or you don't realize you've done wrong. Some say you have to forgive. You forgive me? An old bastard like you? I bet I could. You're a doll. The guys you iced wouldn't forgive. Or you'd have to insist! Only Julie could forgive me. You ask her? She won't ever. You're her father. She won't even speak to me. Want me to see her? I could talk to her. She only thinks about that Louison. He's not a bad guy, after all. By the way, he's on TV tonight. Why don't you go tell him? I bet he doesn't even know. He's in the clouds... Really, you should eat something. Not hungry! Fox! you're on TV tonight. How about that! Livingstone... The Criekville Casino... I remember: we made a hit with the Tica Tica Walk. Tica Tica, what? Oh, shit! That's your new number? Let me explain... Sorry to disturb you! I goofed again! He has clown shoes alright.

You didn't tell me! Julie... Livingstone... Livingstone... Julie... What a pain! It's the antenna, Pop! What a drag! It's the antenna. Go straighten the wire. In this storm? No way! Bastard! It's the antenna, with the wind. Louison! Aurore... Come... It's so much better, here with us... Come... Louison! Come back! I can't hear you. Come back! Go inside, Julie. Watch out! Mr Louison? To the right! More! Okay. That's it. Perfect. Perfect! Don't move! Georges... Aurore... No more Robert... I fell. That pervert. ...who just wants to sink you in the mire, drag you in the sewer, fill you with manure... So it was you! It was you all along!

And you, I'll skin you alive! Wait, I'll get you! I'll get you! Who's coming? Snipers! How did it go? Alright? Everybody okay? Look what I found. And the others? Here they come. How did it go? They were all arms... A real joy ride! And we're all here. Shit! Where'd she come from? Shit! That the guy to grab? That the one you located? - Can you explain? - What? Wasn't that the plan? "Albumin Square. Name: Louison." Here, that's what it says. - It also says, "Sex: male. - clown's." What do you say to that? We'd better check. male! So? Look in the package, and tell me if the sex is male. Alright? That's not my job. Mission Louison was the package. You got it. Is the sex in the package male, or not? Who knows? Sorry Louison, it goes with the job. I'm in a loony bin! I've had it with this bullshit! There's been a mistake, let me go! See guys, pure female! Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers...

Count on those weirdos, they'll fix your buddy for good. What do you say? We go? Of course we're going! All together! Doesn't she ever shut up? They play too rough. A contract is a contract. Who's not in? Rap, you come with me. Milan, Fox, Tourneur... Take the others. Move it! What about me? Don't forget me! What about me? Bastards! In case I don't come back. Open up!
