He is one of the best players in Europe. Olympiakos has already begun, with him to follow. Are not there yet enough donkeys in Greece? Come on, he is a plodder. - No, he is fast and strong. He has an excellent left foot. - Yes, he has two. Nick, I will tell you a story. Two weeks before the season, Elise Lucky breaks his leg. - Oh, that's terrible.

Listen, you are absolutely beautiful. and another time I would you will not be able to continue... Is that right? Want to talk about? - No. No. - Okay. I thought it was okay June would be when I would see. It's so long ago. Why would it not be okay? And Bella gets them there. And that was... I do not know. It is not so, I do not love children. I had never thought that I would want them. I look at this little girl. Frankly, because I felt, I was very lonely. What is it? I was thinking. I thought of, I would like to do this every day. Yes, we can. For the rest of our lives. What is that smell? Who here are shit? You dirty pig. - That is disgusting. Get outside is dirty pig. It was you, huh? My God, there must something was crawled and died. First question. Liam, congratulations your goal against Sweden, this, we group the league affected and the direction of the Knock-Outs.

He made me proud as a friend. He made our country proud. And I know that he made you all proud. I will miss him every day. "Charlie Braithwaite, deceased on I would a few words say about my son. Charlie has just called. I never had him so happy hearing. That the end has come to Charlie's life has no meaning. It would not be this way. It is not fair. But I would like to celebrate someone who had loved And was loved. It does not matter if you it celebrates with a tear or a song. We should celebrate. On Charlie. On Charlie. Thanks, buddy. All you guys would like to thank you, because we might come and to him the last honor to give. Thank you. He was a pass of 37m. Right on my toes. Just great. - That I could once. Thank you. No, thank you. I keep it in water. Only water. It is water. - Well, my boy. I ga to see Sophia. - Yes, of course. Excuse me. Thank you. June. Thank you came. I could not make is not to be. I know how much it meant for you. Bella is in the garden. Why not just go to her? Go ahead. Here. Is that you? Is it so? Come here? Thanks for coming! Hey. How are you? I have your daughter see you play. Yes. She is perfect. There is something I want to give. You know when you have to open it. You know what you must do. Hey. I would not want you to miss your flight. - Yes. See you soon, yes? - Sure. Good luck. - Thank you. Oh, Liam, this is for you. That is... I am. Yes, that's right. Thank you. Dear ladies and gentlemen. The following is a minute's silence for Charlie Braithwaite. These are the 10 players from England who in the second half started. If the next then the penalty. Come on, guys. Lennon is here to help. He falls. And the referee gives a free kick. Frank Lampard will implement it. He is slightly different. What a good rescue of Ricardo. And the defense of the Portuguese disseminated. Another chance. It was so close. Portugal has much to say. Viana is a real danger for England. The same goes for Maniche. And Ronaldo is also highlighted. That was close. Robinson throws himself in full length in the upper right corner. The ball is not in the game. Viana is back to Maniche. Another opportunity for Portugal, Postiga with a headbutt. He is there. The flag is up. No goal. - Yes! Hargreaves plays for 30 minutes good game for England in extra time. Steven Gerrard tries to come here. Lennon behind him. Gerrard! Lampard is here. And even Crouch. A brilliant headbutt by Miguel. No! We are only 5 minutes away from the penalties in this World Cup quarterfinal. He has every right to have cramps. He has just talked to Steve McClaren. And it looks like a replacement. - Inviting you, boy. I wonder if Adams comes out. It should warm up. The players use the time to drink. Lennon goes off. Yes, it's Adams. And you know more, he came from the bank and scored against Sweden. - This is his chance to prove themselves. That's Nuno Valente. And again... over their heads away. Miguel comes from the rear. Maniche! You always get a chance and that was it. You hear the whistle, and this is the end of extra time. The quarter finals, where England since the 62nd minute with 10 men playing will now move on to penalty kicks. Before the chaos with the penalty begins, you say how brilliant England has been since the 62nd minute Wayne Rooney of the field had. This was an excellent game. And Simo shoot first Portugal against Paul Robinson. He concentrates and scores! The ball went directly into the corner. The Portuguese fans celebrating the first. Here is Frank Lampard. Oh, he has him. Viana is now up to the ball. He hits the post. Owen Hargreaves against Ricardo. The goalkeeper was on the ball, but the force, drove him there. This is Petit. He missed the goal. England can be put in front with Gerrard. Ricardo keep him! Helder Postiga. They love you not. Now it's difficult for England. Liam Adams emerges. That does not surprise me. He was always a good penalty taker. Therefore, she probably put on the field. But this is a great moment for him and England. He must try to beat Ricardo, England's hope to keep alive. My God, the pressure must be huge. Adams is here for England. Ricardo was there on time. And let him on the doellat misfire. A disaster Liam Adams and England. The goalkeeper succeeded him his arm to failure to doellat, Liam Adams and England hope almost buried. The faces of the fans fell. Portugal has a great chance. Christiano Ronaldo off the ball. He knows when he scores Robbinson against Portugal and England in the World Cup semi-final is. The player of Manchester United decide on the fate Portugal and England. It is Ronaldo. Verify... And he scores! Portugal is party to celebrate. They go through to the semi-finals. And England is lagging behind the question, what if... Yellow. - Yes, very well done. What is wrong? Marry me. - Are you serious? - I've never been so seriously. That is not so difficult. - Listen. You and Bella are the most exciting, what is confusing me ever. I realize, that in life is that drinking and football. Here I have. You never leave me, June. You are my future. I want to change. Really. But I'll need help. I need your help because you me a better person is. We can, I know we can. Will you marry me, June? Should I answer? Will you please sit. Liam Adams, would you June Marie to be your lawful wedded wife take? Yes. June Marie, do you want Liam Adams to be your lawful wedded husband take? Yes. Then you can give the rings. Here we go. Hello, everybody. - Hi, Santi. Thank you. I have never done. That is probably because nobody like me enough was to be their witness. I've seen the films. And I know how easy it is to this ruin. So what I searched on the Internet. And put it simply you need to tell stories, you must be charming and funny. And I thought: I'm not. But I know... who that is. That is the person who should be. Not me. He could tell stories, he was charming. He was funny. And... He was ripped from our midst, just as he had. And we have lost him. And we had... Santi, you can do it. We all miss him. We all miss him. This is the first time in this city, that a witness gave a speech, without making bad jokes. But it is also suitable. And we understand it all. This is my first speech. I am an Agent. Then you have no friends. I know Liam is already several years and... he's really grown. He has not won the World Cup, But the heart of one of the most beautiful women in the world. And I think that the a much better price. Well, Liam, you are a donkey. But you are the happiest ass in the world. Ladies and Gentlemen, the bride and groom, Liam and June. - Liam and June.
