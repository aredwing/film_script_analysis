Block and tackle? Yeah. I'm not guarding the place this year. You're not? No, it's the age of electronics. What? He's putting in a burglar alarm system. [ Applause On TV ] [ Sighs ] Enough Ping-Pong.

Midnight cowgirl? [ Chuckles ] "Just before closing there was a knock at the back door. It was Jim, a local cowboy and a real hunk." We can't do that one. We don't have a saddle. Look in the closet. [ Crowd Cheering On TV ] You're outrageous. Well, if you don't want to, I could always try it with Garvey. You got to be kidding. You'd need paramedics standing by. Oh, yeah? You'd be surprised. He may be a little short of breath, but at least he doesn't watch Ping-Pong. Go on. "Jim, a local cowboy and a real hunk." [ Cheering Continues ] "I should have said no to him. I was breaking all the library rules. "But he just laughed, locked the door... and pushed me into the Rare Book Room."

Turtle can wait, cowgirl. [ Drops Brush ] I got some range to ride, front pasture to plow. Weslake, I am late for work. I'll see you Saturday. We could try that skydiving next time. We could hang that parachute harness up in here. I'll be the Red Baron! Mr. Weslake? [ Turns Up Volume ] [ Approaching Footsteps ] I can just see your bare ass swingin' in that harness. [ Clears Throat ] Mr. Weslake? Yes? Sorry to bother you, but, uh, I have to get your block converter. My what? The little box on your TV. My cable? Why? It works terrific. [ Laughs ] You're a little behind on your subscription payments. Me? Six months. No, no, no. That's gotta be some kind of computer foul-up at the bank. It's okay. I'll make it all right. Look, you can't take it. I've been waiting for ages for that Nakajima-Cuellas fight. You can't take it now. Sorry, Mr. Weslake, but don't worry about the fight. Nakajima, he's gonna tear him apart. Won't be much to see. [ Static ] [ Humming ] [ Kids Chattering ] That's awful. What? If you're gonna do it, do it right. Tack it in the joint there. Keeps it out of sight, doesn't look so messy. [ Clock Cuckooing ] Come here. Huh? What? Take a look. Ohh. You wanna sell your father's watch? No. Are you telling me what time it is? No, I was just wondering what something like that might be worth. To me? It's real gold. Plate. [ Clock Chiming ] Gold! Solid gold. It runs great. It's running a little slow. [ Groans ] Six bucks. Six bucks! It's an antique! We're talkin' about a time when men made things by hand. That was then. These days, you buy a watch, you wanna see what time it is. Look, Weslake, you don't wanna hock this. Here, here. Come on. You know, it's a good thing I don't need the money, because if I was serious about pawning that watch, you would have made me angry. Very angry! Listen, business is business. Yeah. Yeah, business is business. Well, here's a nickel. I'm gonna use the john. Oh, the best things in life are free. [ Chuckling ] [ Humming ] [ Humming Continues ] [ Humming ] [ Singing ] Turtle! I'll meet you in Garvey's in ten minutes. Good morning, Mrs. O'Malley. Aye. Good morning. Jasmine, we're going now. Hi. And don't be creative. Just move the furniture exactly the way we told you. Oh, and Jasmine? Huh? Don't use my cast iron pan. It's only for omelettes. Worry me about a pot and a pan! [ Door Slams ] Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen... Weren't you just doin' that? He don't want me to forget, so he keeps me practicin'. Remember what you were talkin' about yesterday? Yeah. I think we may be able to work somethin' out. There's a girl cleaning the apartment on the second floor right behind us. Entrance is on 23rd Street. Go in there and find out who lives there, what their hours are; Make a little drawing of the apartment, where everything is. Okay? What's that got to do with Dillard, Ramon and Garvey? If you and me are going to be working together, I'm in charge. Got it? Meet me at my place, up there, at 3:00. 3119. Just up the street. Okay? Wait, wait. What do I get? Rich... maybe. Depends on what she says. And, Boardwalk... keep your mouth shut. You're talkin' to the right man. [ Fussing ] Come on, Tyrone. [ Grunts ] Give me the key. What for? You gotta trust him, Garvey. He's installing it. [ Garvey ] All right. Now let's see if it works. [ Button Clicks ] Let's see. Nobody broke in yet. We have to wait? Jesus. I'm gonna lock the door from the outside, and you open the door without the key. That's somebody breakin' in. It's all wired to the key. All right. All wired to the key. [ Player Piano Playing ] [ Electric Fan Whirring ] [ Cymbals Clanging, Chittering ] [ Cuckooing, Chiming ] [ Car Horn Honking, Cymbal Clanging, TV Static ] [ Gadgets Continue Clamoring ] [ Screaming, Frankenstein Growls ] [ Horn Blaring ] Yippee!

[ Clamoring Continues, Loud Explosion ] [ Garvey ] It doesn't work! The stupid switch doesn't work! Dillard, come on, do something! [ Din Continues ] [ Sirens, Gadgets Winding Down ] Power main. Okay, hold it! Right there! Nobody moves! Put your gun away, Ronnie. Garvey's just testing his new burglar alarm. Weslake, what's going on? You're telling me Garvey paid for an alarm? [ Laughing ] [ Mocking Laughter ] That's right, wise guy. You hear it this Saturday, you come in blasting. You got my permission. Good morning, madam. I'm with the gas company. [ Tyrone Cooing ] Say, babe, I'm your gas man. [ Sniffing ] Tyrone! No, no! Not now! [ Continues Cooing ] Look, I know it's the only thing you do real good, but there is a time and a place for everything, and this ain't that, okay? Good morning, sugar. I'm with the gas... company. What? [ Sniffing ] It's not gas. [ Sniffing ] [ Tyrone Cooing ] Let me take the baby. And watch how I do it. I'm only gonna show you one time. Right on, Tyrone. What's your name? Jasmine. And I'm busy. Hey, hey, that's what I came to talk to you about. I can make you very busy. Don't let these work clothes fool you none. You're looking at a highly-respected interior decorator... who just happen to believe in doing the important work her own self. You did all this? I'm doing it. So, if you'd kindly be about your business, I'll be about mine. Hey, lady, cool out! Look, I just thought we might be able to help each other a little bit. You are a fine looking woman, you know. Help each other? Yeah. You're smart too. I can see that now. You think you can help me? You name the place. Wonderful. Now, we'll move the dining room over there in the bay... and we'll make this the den. Uh, you'll move the couch perpendicular to the fireplace. Oh, and of course, this china closet... will go in the bay as well. Where you goin'? I gotta see Ramon. Yeah? Why? He copy keys? I gave him back the key. Yeah, but you can do pretty good with wax if you know what you're doin'. Come on. That was Ramon's idea. I didn't like it from the start. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna think about it. You and him meet me at my place this afternoon at 4:00, 3119, okay? Dillard, tell your pal that was a really dumb idea. The guys that rig alarms are the first ones they check. Turtle! Nobody move! - Get your hands up. - [ Giggling ] - Keep 'em up. - [ Maria Giggling ] Gonna put cuffs on. [ Both Laughing ] If he catches you here alone with me... Little Ramon? Mi amigo Ramoncito? That's no problem. You like to live dangerously or what? It's only the good die young. Are you a mechanic too? No, I'm a musician. Oh, yeah, sure. That's what everybody says. Oh, no, listen. [ Harmonica ] [ Men's Voices ] [ Stops Playing ] Oh, my God, it's Ramon! Oh, good, I gotta talk to him. No, no, no, you've got to hide. You know what he'll do if he see you? Hide? Pasele, Don Garrido. Venga, Maria. Le presento a Don Fernando Pablo Jesus y de la Vaca. My sister Maria Elena Mercedes. Hi, Fernando. Hi, Maria. It's a pleasure to see you. Sientese, Don Fernando. Un cafecito? Traigale un cafe. How's your family, Don Fernando? They're fine. How is your mother, Maria? Oh, uh, she's away, on family business. Oh, I thought Immigration sent her back to Mexico. [ Stammers ] Uh, but of course, I never pay any attention to the malicious gossip of the neighborhood. No. Y es mejor asi. Sugar? Ahorita se la traigo. [ Gasps, Coffee Splashing ] Maria, por poco se me queman las entranas. I'm so terribly sorry! No, don't worry. Forgive me! It was my fault... Voy por una toalla. [ Knocking ] Hey, Ramon. Oh, Senor Dillard. Nice to see you. I want you to meet my friend Don Fernando Pablo Jesus de la Vaca... who has kindly come to call on my sister, Maria. Jesus, Ramon. You pimpin' family now? You want something? I'm busy. Weslake's hip to the plan. He wants us to be at his place at 4:00. What the hell you talk about? Weslake, he knows! He's got the key and the wax both. Shit! No, no, over there in the corner. Hmm. I guess I was wrong. It was better before. Oh, no! No! Everything looks just fine just like this. Wouldn't change a thing. [ Laughing ] You know, I had you figured for some lazy pimp. [ Panting ] Who me? Lazy? Mm-hmm. I ain't no lowlife. Anyway, thanks. Thanks? That's it? You got something special in mind? [ Dishes Clatter ] Ham hocks and red beans? Mm-hmm. Ooh. [ Laughs ] Mmm! Not bad for a second choice. [ Chuckles ] Take your time, man. The food won't run away. [ Laughs ] Time. I gotta go. [ Tyrone Gurgling ] Where you going? Uh, gotta take care of a little business. Right? [ Tyrone Cooing ] How about dinner tomorrow night? [ Weslake ] This is 24th Street? Right. She works for two guys who live together. They go up to the Russian River every weekend. And upstairs? Upstairs, another guy who's also pretty. An artiste. He's usually out for the night. Cruises North Beach all weekend. First floor? First floor. Landlady, Mrs. O'Malley. Deaf as a stone. [ Sniffing ] What is it? [ Doorbell Buzzing ] I think it's ham hocks and red beans. Open the door. This is the front room? Yeah. Let me see. Yeah, right. Well, you see this is the den. This used to be the dining room. We switched them around. [ Weslake ] But this is 24th Street? [ Boardwalk ] Yeah, of course. [ Purring ] [ Weslake ] Good afternoon, gentlemen. You? What you doin' here? Hey, man, I ain't said nothin'. He didn't say anything. I saw Dillard palm the key myself. So? So, I figured if you start out that dumb, you need all the help you can get. You got a better idea? You bet your ass, Pancho. Come here. My name is Ramon. What is it? [ Weslake ] Sit down. You in or you out? [ Cat Purring ] [ Ramon ] How I know until I hear a plan? [ Cat Yowls ] The only thing you gotta know is your plan sucks... and my plan takes us to Hawaii... the safe. I'm listening. Okay. I'll accept that. My plan is simplicity itself. We break in, and we hit the safe. [ Dillard ] How do we do that? We use an expert. Who? Old friend of mine. A locksmith... with an interesting sideline in old safes, if you get my meaning. Gentlemen? [ Weslake ] What the hell do you mean, you won't, you can't? [ Man ] Absolutely not! But on the phone... I'm only out of the joint a month! They catch me again, they throw the key away! Forget it! I shouldn't even be consorting with you guys! But you... Do you know they'll look for any excuse... to revoke parole? The cops don't like short people. But I said I could help and I will. [ Birds Squawking ] [ Dog Howling, Barking ] Ah! I'll show you how to open a safe! [ Tyrone Cries ] Voila! Now, the secret of cracking boxes... opening safes to you... Is based on the presumption that what is on the inside can be outside. And what is on the outside... Stop eating! We'll have intermission later! That is, you desire what is on the outside to be on the inside. Hey, can you show us how to get in? And what is on the inside... Sure! [ Cracking Knuckles ] [ Birds Squawking ] [ Squawking Continues ] [ Dial Clicking ] [ Clicking Continues ] Jesus, that's fantastic. Thank you. Looks easy. I know, but it isn't. Yeah, but you can teach us. I doubt it. Besides, it takes years. How we gonna do it then? Patience. The secret for safes is patience. Especially when we use the historically important... circular saw. Oh, Weslake, you turn and you oil. [ Tyrone Cooing ] Lazzarelli, this is gonna take forever. Precisely! That's why it's only of a passing interest. Lazzarelli! How do we get into the safe? - Soup! - Soup? Soup! Soup? Soup. A nitroglycerin compound, only not quite so dangerous. How does it work? Two wires, electrical outlet, a drop of soup on the hinges or in the lock, and "open sesame!" Try it on this. Lift that sawhorse up for me, will you, Ramon? Okay. Watch it with that stuff, Dillard! He said it was safe. Yeah, well, it is. You just gotta be a little careful. That battery work? Yeah. Okay, come on. Try it on here. No, you do it. You're the electrician. Hey, Weslake, what's that shit supposed to do? Just watch and see. You got it live for God's sakes! Soup! A nitroglycerin compound, two wires, an electrical outlet, one drop of soup... and... "open sesame." [ Electrical Sparking, Loud Explosion ] - [ Dillard Screaming ] [ Cruisers Hooting ] [ Mexican ] He's so mean Don't you get him mad now Once you get him pounding You let your love shine There ain't a star in the sky doesn't understand why You got me crashin' in your eyes tonight [ Cruisers Laughing, Hooting ] Yo, fellas!

[ Both Laughing ] [ Cruisers' Radios Blaring ] Oh! Man, you dropped my foot! [ Continues ] Dillard, you need a doctor. No, doctors. They have to talk to the police. Yeah, they give you downers. I can't get behind downers. Well, Maria can fix it. Yeah, Maria can fix it! Okay, I'll walk you home. [ Groans ] I don't know if I can make it home. I think I better sleep here tonight. [ Rooster Crowing ] [ Harmonica ] [ Footsteps ] Jasmine is no longer in our employ. When she was, she wasn't a decorator. Well, she moved all that stuff. Oh, that. Just a whim. But if you do windows, we could use... Nah, nah. I don't do anything you want, man. Nothin'! Non gustibus disputandum est. Say, man, why don't you just watch your mouth! Now, where is she? No idea. But if you find her, tell her we'd love to have our silver back. What silver? Just mention it if you see her! She didn't take your damn silver, man! All right. Hey, what is this? What are you all doin' here? We just wanted to make sure you got off okay. I'll get off okay if you get out of my way. Come on, move, huh? She'll kill me if I'm late. Let's go. Here, lock it. Oh, Turtle. Here, look. First of the season. [ Sniffs ] Incredible! Incredible. [ Garvey ] What's so incredible? It's only a salmon. [ Starts Engine ] We have to approach this as if it was a military exercise. Timing, precision, coordination, teamwork, skill, courage. That's hip, that John Wayne shit. You're not gonna bring that with you, are you? [ Gurgling ] We can't get through there. I got that front all wired. You didn't wire the back, did you? The back's just a solid wall. Precisely. We are gonna go through that wall from the apartment... on the second floor of the building next to the O'Malley building. That's how we get to the safe. We get into that building... from the coal chute on 23rd Street... and that's where we meet this morning at 0200. Okay? [ Groans ] 0200. Okay. Okay. Okay. 0201: Bolt cutter cuts the coal chute lock. 0202: Turtle goes into the coal chute and up the stairs. 0203: You open the front door of the building. 0204: We force open the door of the apartment upstairs. Did you get the crowbar? You got a tire iron in the trunk of that pink thing? No sweat. [ Exhaling ] We then use the jack... to go through the wall into Garvey's upstairs. - Jack, Ramon? - Crank type, right? Right. [ Exhales ] Drill? Not to worry. [ Exhales ] Okay, I figure all that should take about 17 minutes. So, at 0221 we are downstairs and at the safe. [ Tyrone Fusses ] [ All ] Hawaii! Shut up. 0222: We use the plasticene and Dillard wires the hinges. Two drops of soup, electrical outlet and... Open sesame! Okay. Alibis. Ramon? I don't need one. I don't even supposed to be in this country. [ Laughing ] A black man don't need one. Law don't believe him anyway. - Dillard? - I figured I'd say I was with you. I have an alibi. I forgot. [ Boardwalk ] I'll check you out later on, okay? Okay. Come with me. We'll get the jack. I gotta get some wire for the soup. Okay, we'll do that on the way. Well, special wire. Okay. [ Harmonica ] Mami, estoy muy cansada. Andale, ya. - [ Stops Playing ] - [ Maria ] Mama! Took control over my mind Made me want him every day Say, what the hell you think you doin'? Getting ready for work. What kind of work you dressed for like that? Well, you know. Girl, you crazy. I didn't like being an interior decorator. The customer's never satisfied. What you doing? Gettin' you off the street. Certain people are real protective of their territory, and we're on it. You're standing me up, aren't you? It's not standing you up if I tell you I can't make it beforehand. [ Man ] You can't do this to me. There's no reason to do it. With all the crime in this city, you're giving out tickets! Why don't you do something about real criminals? Weslake, I expected better from you. This is awfully short notice, you know, and it's not easy in San Francisco these days. Maxie, it's just one night. It was just two minutes! Come on! Maxie, I will make it up to you, I swear! I can't make up a lost Saturday night. But next Thursday you might be on your back in Paris. France! Come on, Weslake, you know you'll never have to deliver on that one. Why? Because I have to be back here on Friday... for Don Fernando. Well, we could have dinner at Chez Panisse. Yes? Just don't ever let this happen again. Do you understand? Yes, sir. [ Motorist ] Okay, I'll move the car. I hate the car. I'll move the car. Hey, fella. You busy tonight? What are you doin', honey? [ Ripping Ticket ] Ramon, you gotta let me explain about last night. I was only taking Maxine home. I certainly didn't mean to be disrespectful to your lovely sister Maria. In fact, I have a small token of my affection. I come to wash up. [ Jasmine ] Why you won't let me? You ain't gonna whore for two reasons. One: It's skilled labor. You gotta learn before you earn. Nobody gonna be payin' you $500 a night just because you look good. Five hundred dollars. What's a $500-a-night whore do? See? There ain't no such thing as a $500 whore, just $500 johns. There's tricks to walkin'. There's tricks to talkin'. You could teach me. Now that brings us to the second reason why you can't whore. Which is? You're too smart. You're too pretty. [ Laughs ] [ Tyrone Gurgling ] Damn it. The keys to the apartment. Here, let me take care of that for you. How come? Oh, let's just say, I give them the keys, show them how honest you are, we split the silver. What silver? [ Laughs ] Come on, now. This is Boardwalk you're talkin' to. The silver you took when you was decoratin'. They say that I took their silver? Oh, it's cool. We won't take it to Garvey. We'll go uptown and get some real money for it. Damn it to hell, Boardwalk! You're just like 'em! Any time they lose something with all their damn furniture movin', they have to blame the nigger maid. The same damn thing happen at the last place. The old lady say I broke her Cuisinart. I can't even run a damn Cuisinart, but she fired me! And it's gonna happen again and again and... [ Sighing ] [ Inhales, Exhales ] Mm-hmm, that's right. I ain't no decorator. I'm a maid, and I was a good one too. But now I ain't got a job, and I wish I had taken their damn silver! [ Sobbing ] It's okay. It's okay. I knew you wasn't no decorator. Didn't make no difference to me. [ Sniffling ] 'Cause you got a pretty face. You got a pretty name. Jasmine. [ Crying ] What? [ Crying ] My name is Betty. I made up "Jasmine." [ Continues Crying ] [ Laughing ] Come on, come on, it's okay. It's all right. [ Laughing ] You think my mama named me "Boardwalk"? Hmm? [ Laughing ] Now, don't... Don't you worry. I got something goin'. After tonight you gonna be workin' for me. But you said I didn't know how. No, not that. I'm gonna be needin' a personal secretary. Maybe you can start tonight. Take care of Tyrone for me. I mean, if it's cool. [ Sniffs ] I wouldn't mind you teachin' me some of that stuff. What stuff? Oh, that stuff. [ Mexican ] [ Woman Laughing ] [ Continues ] [ People Chattering ] Mama! I' Ramoncito, mi hijo! I' Oh, mi hijo! Oh, gracias, mi hijo. Gracias. I want you to meet Don Dillard. He's been so good to take care of la Maria... while I was away and you were so busy. Nice to meet you. I' Ramon! I' Con respeto! Nice to meet you, Don Dillard. [ Tapping ] [ Weslake ] Testing, one, two, three, four. [ Static, People Laughing, Chattering ] What's so funny over there? You havin' a good time? Huh? [ Crunching Chips ] [ Woman's Voice ] Oh, Weslake, I this is just the most wonderful party. Do you think I could have a little more champagne? - [ Cork Pops ] Oh, you're so generous. What time is it? [ Man's Voice ] It's 2:30 by my watch, but I think I'm a little slow. Is it 2:35 over there? [ Party Music, Chattering Continues ] [ Ringing Bell ] Telephone! Boardwalk, for you. [ Muffled Voice ] Hey, kids! [ Crunching ] [ Slurping ] [ Man On Record ] Aw, man, wait a minute. [ Inhaling ] [ High-Pitched Voice ] You contractors all have such a wonderful time at parties. I'm amazed. This is terribly well-organized, the way you've done it. [ Man On Record ] Man, come on, let's go. [ Weslake ] Wait a minute! Dillard's gonna play the guitar. Hang on and listen. Shut up, everybody, and let Dillard play the guitar. [ Static, Flamenco Guitar Strumming ] Shut up, I said! Hey, Dillard, you're terrific. The best, man... [ Guitar Continues ] [ Boardwalk Sighs ] Where the hell is he? [ Sighing ] Everybody here? Yeah! Okay, synchronize watches. Fifty-three. Fifty-four. Fif... [ Clock Striking 2:00 ] Sixty. Okay, let's go. The coal chute. Hey, Boardwalk. What? The keys. I ain't got no keys. Ramon says he saw you at La Rondall with the scrub. He said she gave 'em to you. She changed her mind. The keys are not part of the plan. We stick to the plan. [ Bangs Cans ] Shh! [ Dog Barking ] Bolt cutter. [ Rattling ] Bolt cutter! [ Snickering ] [ Wheezing Laughter ] Good. Ready? Yeah. When you get to the bottom, go up the stairs and let us in the front door, okay? Okay. I'll help you down. Good. [ Turtle Screams, Crashing ] [ Clattering ] Turtle? [ Banging, Cat Meows ] [ Turtle Screams, Cat Meows ] Turtle? [ Meowing Continues, Groaning ] Are you all right? [ Groaning ] What are you doin'? The door is stuck. All right. Get him out of there. [ Dog Barking ] Okay. Plan "B." Piece of cake. Fire escape. We go around and up, over the skylight, down the shaft, in through the window. Simple. Come on. Get down! Piece of cake. Dillard? Okay, I got it. [ Yells ] [ Dogs Barking ] Okay, go on up. Turtle, go ahead. Boardwalk, go! Ramon... go! What's the matter? The tool bag. I'll take the goddamn tool bag. Come on. Now what? I don't like ladders. This is a hell of a time to mention it! Nobody asked me before. [ Tires Screeching, Dogs Barking ] Where's Ramon? He wouldn't climb the ladder. That's cool. Just more for us. [ Dillard ] No way, man. He's part of the team. He is, huh? That's funny, 'cause I don't see him. We're already four minutes and 28 seconds behind schedule. Come on, let's go. [ Boardwalk ] Say, man, you sure this thing's gonna hold us up? Yeah, it's plate. Just don't walk on the glass. Just go on carefully and brace yourself against the edge of it, like this. Careful. Easy, Turtle. Freeze! Shit! [ Dillard Gasps ] [ Artiste ] Welcome to my little atelier. So this is the, uh, thing you were talking about. [ Laughing ] Ooh! It's so big. What I'm trying to do with it... I-I-I'm trying to explore the interplay of light and shadow... as it moves through space. Hmm. It's very sexy. Ah, Maxine, you promised me. Maybe I lied. You're gonna tell me everything about your mother. Now put the music on. [ Classical ] Oh, Maxine, what are you doing? Helping you relax. I'm very relaxed. [ Maxine Giggles ] Your toes are clenched. [ Maxine Giggling ] [ Indistinct Talking ] [ Bottle Clanks ] Psst, here. [ "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" ] This is one of my favorite pieces of music. What is it? The Nutcracker. Really? Mm-hmm. "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy." Oh, how sweet. Well, it just makes me feel like moving in space. [ Continues ] She's a wonderful dancer. Maxine. Wha... No. What are you doing? Stop. We already talked about this. I know, honey. I just had another thought. Maxine! Don't worry. That's the good part. I get to show you. Maxine! Relax. I'll do the hard part. [ Gasps ] Atta boy, tiger! [ Artiste ] Jesus, you're kinkier than I thought. [ Maxine Giggling ] Come on! I got all stiff. In the leg, man. That's the window over there. [ Turtle ] Do we have to do this? Turtle! Come on. [ Dillard Groaning ] The soup! Dillard. Boardwalk stepped on my damn hand. Glass cutter. It's got no cutter! Shit! [ Boardwalk ] That's the way I would have done it in the first place. Just shut up and show us the way. [ Stumbling On Glass ] We are one hour and 23 minutes behind schedule. Where are we? You're in the dining room. No, no, that's the den. W-Wait a minute. [ Weslake ] One, two, three, That used to be the living room. Four, five, six, seven, eight... Ohh! What took you so much? Ramon? How'd you get in? Okay, I saw the meter maidcome in the front with this guy, so I put my foot on the door. Good, huh? Good. Did you know she was in here? Yeah, yeah, we knew. But how did you get in this place? Did you break in to this apartment? No. The door, it was open. Yeah. All right, all right. Let's go. Ten, eleven... Boardwalk, drill right there. [ Banging ] What are you doin'? I gotta find a spot. Just drill there. All right. You're the boss. [ Drill Revving ] You hit the water pipe! You told me to drill here! [ Mrs. O'Malley ] Oh, he'll be so happy to see you. You're such a little gypsy. [ Cat Meowing ] I'll turn on the light. There you go. Now, there, you're home. [ Water Gurgling ] Hello? Mr. Monicelli? This is Vera O'Malley, your neighbor. I just wanted you to know that my idea worked. I left the door open and the kitty came back. What? You wanted her out? How come? Well, never mind. I know why you wanted her out. Just a second. I'll get her. - Naughty kitty. - Get the cat. Naughty kitty. [ Meowing ] [ Sighs ] Okay. I put the kitty out again. But I'm afraid you're going to have a little cleanup to do when you get home. Huh? Yes, I got the key. No, it wasn't Jasmine who brought it. A friend of hers. A nice colored gentleman. A real fancy dresser, I'll tell you. Bye-bye. [ Hangs Up Phone, Footsteps ] [ Meows ] [ Door Closes ] Okay. Over here. Move the furniture. "Nice colored gentleman," eh? What? I get it. You have the hard-on for the maid. You talkin' to me, man? I don't care about no maid. Besides, she's a decorator. You had the key! It doesn't make any difference. If he had used the key, they could have traced it to him and nailed all of us. Now, get to work! Exactly! Dillard, Ramon, bring that couch. Turn. [ Weslake ] We're nearly there. [ Indistinct Muttering ] [ Groaning ] Damn! This shit's harder than workin'! [ Debris Falling ] We are four hours and 17 minutes behind schedule. Now, let's do it, and let's do it right this time. [ Weslake ] Aw, shit. Wrong wire. Perfect. Frijoles. [ Boardwalk ] Mm-mm. Red beans and ham hocks. [ Clock Cuckooing ] It's good. Yeah. Jasmine's all right. She can cook. It needs chilies. It don't need nothin'. It's great just the way it is. Soup. Okay. Soup. Careful. Right in there. There. Don't let that loose wire touch the terminal yet. We're gonna blow it. If you wanna help, get out of the way. Ramon, give me some light. Everybody set? Here we go to Hawaii. [ Rattling ] [ Rattling Continues ] [ Rooster Crowing ] The fish was too much for her. She just looked at it and... smiled... and closed her eyes forever. Your mother? You know her last word? Lox. Yeah, she loved salmon. She used to cure it herself; A little dill, a little brandy. Hmm. Come on. Feel better. Sit down. I'm real sorry, Garvey. That's a tough one, man. Mis pesames, Garvey. Yeah, that mother stuff's a heavy gig, man. I'm sorry. [ Sighs ] Well, I'm glad you're all here. I don't know what I would have done. Would you like some... [ Groans ] Hmm. Oh! Here, have some salmon. Hmm? You'll like that. Have a drink. Salud. Salud. Piece of fish? [ Meowing ] [ Player Piano Playing, Toy Chimp Chittering ] - [ Chittering, Clanging ] - [ Sirens Blaring ] [ Gadgets Clamoring ] The key! The key! The key! The key, where is it? [ Clamoring Continues ] [ Gadgets Winding Down, Clock Cuckoos ] Okay, buster! Hold it, right there! I got him, I got him! [ Chimp Buzzes, Bangs Piano Keys ] Move! Move! Get your hands on the counter! Move! [ Garvey Groans ] What are you doin'? What do you want? We heard your alarm. We caught this guy red-handed. [ Garvey ] Caught this guy? We just gave him the key to turn it off. It was an accident. Forget it. Looks like they came in from the apartment behind, came down the stairs. [ Sighs ] Where were you two? If it weren't for my friends here, I'd have nothing. Here you are arresting the heroes. Heroes? Did any of you heroes get a description? They were black. They was Mexican. They had ski masks. Right! It was ski masks. Black Mexicans wearin' ski masks. Come on, Ronnie. [ Boardwalk ] You should have been here, Garvey. I really scared one of them big suckers. Oh, I appreciate that. They do any damage? Uh, a little. But I'm sure we'll be able to put it back together. Oh. That'll be nice. Well, you guys are friends indeed. This salmon won't keep. You know, Weslake, those robbers were pretty dumb. I wouldn't say that. I thought it was a pretty professional job. The safe, I only had it for the picture. There hasn't been anything in it for years. Wasn't even locked. [ Clock Cuckooing ] [ Garvey ] Ah, what's the difference. Friendship, that's what's important. But, in the meantime, you'll have to do. We got more than we need But we don't even notice Right before our eyes Our dreams just up and fade away We keep givin' up more tears And losin' hope for something better Of pain and disappointment We got more than we need We got more than we need Enough fear and confusion To keep us busy running Reaching out so desperately We keep wasting our faith on illusion Risking it all on a roll of the dice If our past is the dreams of tomorrow Then we're travelin' together We got more than we need Of old lies and deception Hiding in the shadows Wondering who we should believe We keep thinking the path of resistance Is too steep to climb on our own We are finding the truth in our sorrow And we're travelin' together We got more than we need
