I was a burden for him as to repeat these in this country. How will not hate me? Their debt is liquidated. Now it should not. This is not to pay a debt. Sam is part of me and I him forever. This makes the learning much when I was a girl. It was well and nothing could change it. Together cavalgvamos for miles. For hours. Sam five steps backwards. In respectful silence as a good place. I shudder to content because I knew what love was. My father does not worry tardana on our return. Sam knew it was trust. Would return unharmed. Sit on the grass. Facing the bay, looking the ocean calm,... ... deep and quiet... ... as their love for me. I knew because of his love had spoken to me of him. With soft and sweet Irish voices. We never said anything. One day we went to Dublin the exhibition of livestock. Sam subjects my horse a store front. When grabbed the stirrup so I put up... ... said with his voice rough,... ... 'I condemn this. " I said: 'Sam baby,... ... I will save. " That night grabbed the jewels that was prepared... ... to the dance of the viceroy and ride for hours... ... in the rain until druggist.

Was cleaning and pressing the gun that had brought it. ria as hum in a low voice. Then came Dermot, my brother. It was a great rider, its only good quality. Carrying a pistol in his hand. With the death in the eyes said... ... who married them? Not enjoy it '. Pointed his gun at me. Sam stood up for a jump. Covered me with his body. Grabbed the gun on the table and shot against my brother. Shot under the arm of Sam. There was an expression of amazement on his face. Dermot dropped. The gun he shot to fall. They found the bullet in March of the window. This saved the power of Sam... ... as found guilty. Did not know that he is accused. I was so sick that I am not acquainted with anything.
