A young woman like you fooling around like that. You'll die! Oh, really? Then, kill me. - The kid cried too much. - I practiced with him. I won't pay you the next time you bring a kid like that. Good timing kid. Hey, Shark! Take it out! Man, that hurt. - Get it out! - Yes, sir. That's better. I send in a bike and they run. Should we have given them a ride? We're here! Stop! Go get some rest. - You too, Jung-hwan. - Yeah. You were brave, man! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Are you okay? It's Jung-hwan, mom. What's this? Stop it please. Let's talk this out. I don't care if I end up like this 'cuz of you. But I won't stand for anything happening to my mom! I'm really sorry. I didn't think they'd hurt my family! Your family? Who are you calling your family? I'm sorry. Then get out! That'll solve everything! Get out! - I can't. - What? You don't know how long I've waited To find you and make you mine. I've never been happier in my life. I have parents that I never had and my sons have their father. This is my house. I'm not leaving! Why you! - That little! - What are you doing? - Is this all I've raised you up to? - Mom! I don't need a son who doesn't respect his sons' mother. Get out! Fine! Guess that'll solve this. I don't need to be around to see you get stabbed! Why that little! Jung-hwan! Son! Give me some clothes. I'm taking a shower. Didn't you go home? Sir, I can't open the door. Can you come up over the balcony outside? What's with all the crap? This is the wedding gift I told you about. Sir! Idiot. How could you, sir? But still, he's your only son. He's always asking for money so I thought it was a joke. If I knew, I would've sent the money long before. Not you! Jung-hwan. Look son. Do you hate the prosecutor that much? As you age, your wife is the only one who'll take care of you. Look at me. I'd be nothing without your mom. And Jung-hwan. Know what your dad hates the most in the world? To hear you call dad a gangster. When you were going into grade 5. You wrote gangster under the section for father's job. - I did not. - You did! Know how much that hurt your dad? That's when I decided to become a dad you can be proud of. At this rate, you're gonna end up like me! What if your sons call you a mutt-head later on? Aw, dad. Not again. I'm leaving! Hey, Jung-hwan! Your letters! Why that little! Sir! Sir! - That little twerp! - Are you okay? Do you know where he spent the wedding money he got, sir? I called my mom earlier. She said that he sent her the money to pay off her debts. All the money for getting married! So, my mom asked where he got so much money. So I said it was from you. But it wasn't, huh? Doesn't hurt as much.... Your father made many mistakes, too in the past. He was a gang leader. Always going around fighting... Eun-ju, honey. I know how hard it must've been for you. Growing up without your parents... I worried about that at first. I just thank you for taking in my spoiled son. No, I'm the one.... I don't care about what happened today. Just go with what you believe in. No matter what you're my daughter now. Good morning. I was too drunk last night. Let's just forget about what happened last night. You said you're thankful for me saving you? Let's just leave it at this. And don't come for me again. I go into full training next week. I am so happy to meet you! Twins? I'm gonna me a mother to twins? Do you know what? Mommy and daddy made you in one try! Stop kicking little babies. I wonder who you look like. I hope you take after your handsome dad rather than me. This is where we had our first date. Mommy doesn't like beef soup. But I couldn't get enough of it when I was pregnant with you. I think it's because of your dad. Breathe slowly. That's it. One, two, three! Congratulations on your first son. One more time! Here's your second son. Two weeks to the state bar exam! Mommy's going to pass it on the first try! You believe me? I wish your daddy was here.... He saved me once when I was drowning. Your daddy's been everything to me ever since. Actually, daddy doesn't like mommy very much. Mommy knows. But it's okay 'cuz I love your daddy. He'll know how I feel someday. Today is mommy's birthday. But I can't stop crying.... I'll only cry today and never again. But today I miss your daddy more than ever.... Get up! Get up! - Get up! Get up! - I'm so sorry. Get up! Get up!He's always like that! Get up! Get up! Chil-gu! Get up! Let's go. Who are you?

Fine. $100 00 for the two of us? Make the call, Jung-hwan. Hold on fool. It's different this time. Of course the beach and the factory are different. Call your dad, man... Call her out quietly. If not, he dies. Stop it! You bitch! You think you can get away with abducting me? I'm not doing it! Just get lost! Jung-hwan! How dare you? The phone please. - Why are you on the phone? - It's my fault for picking up the phone? No, it's just ah.... That's right! I had you abducted! I asked them to knock some sense into you.
