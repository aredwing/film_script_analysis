That's enough for me to be happy.. eh...listen i have a story to tell... There was an island, and on it, it had all the feelings. There was Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge...... and even Love.. One day the island was going under... All feelings aboarded their ships and sail away But only Love stayed with the island to the last munite That was stupid move! Hah...Love will jump ship at the last munite! Love requested Success as it sailing away... But Success refused to let Love on board... My ship is full of treasure, there no more room. Love then turned to Selfishness.. Please Selfishness i beg of you! Selfishness replied: I won't be bothered! Then came Sadness, Love was awfully distressed But Sadness disregarded Love's existence and just wanted to be alone Happiness also sailed by, but did not even noticed Love, for it was intoxicated with its own happiness All of a sudden there was a loud voice: Love come with me, I will take you. It was the voice of an old man, Love was so happy it forgot to ask for his name. When on land, Love came to its senses and turned to Knowlegde, Who took us here? Knowlegde replied: it was Time Because time will help us understand how great love is. I dated Kang for a short time, He was my dad's favorite disciple, But when dad knew about he and I, dad kicked him out. Kang went away on his bike, that how we were seperated. Men need a son to carry on the Muay Thai legacy Talented Muay Thai fighter is essential and is in needed. Dad said many time, girl is a burden around the house I have done nothing to make him proud. This time I will prove to him that Girls also has potential. Hey Josh! How did schooling in the US work out for you? It doesn't matter where, I can't seem to focus on one thing.
