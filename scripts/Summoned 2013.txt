I just haven't had the time. I can't even find the instructions. Keeping busy over there? Yes. Just gardening, painting, trying to get all the pieces done for the show, you know? Good. Good, good. Maybe you should, I don't know, hit up eHarmony while you're at it. Vicki, come on. It's either that or you move back to the city. I can't be the only one getting action around here. No, what I need is a big sale. Yes. That, my dear, is what alimony is for. Oscar, do you have the remote? The San Francisco Police Department has not confirmed that Palardis's death was in fact a suicide. The police are puzzled - regarding the circumstances surrounding Hello? - I'm gonna have to call you back. - Palardis was perhaps best known as foreman of the jury on the infamous Midnight Murderer case. Six months ago, he self-published a book about the trial and was reportedly working on a follow-up. Do you want to tell me what the hell we're doing up here, Mike? I'm investigating. And you're in my light. Now I know that must have hurt. Don't you have some pressing business to take care of back at the station? Well, actually, Mike, we both have a lot of pressing business to take care of back at the station, which is why I'm wondering why you're wasting your time on a suicide. People don't just throw themselves off buildings without a reason. Well, I hate to tell you this, Mike, but sometimes bad stuff just happens. Shall I have the M.E. put that on the death certificate? He can quote me on it. Why don't you go grab a latte or something? I'll be down in a few. Who are you kidding with that? You know you want a cigarette. I haven't had a cigarette in over a month. Congratulations. Listen, Mike, I know you knew the guy, but please don't be too long. There's no note. I thought you'd like to know. Thanks. - All right, Frank. - Huh? I brought you some magazines. You expect me to be entertained with these two-year-old magazines and "The People's Court"? Oh, hi. Thank goodness you came. Hi, Frank. I brought you a muffin. Oh, by the way, I got your invite about the opening. Yeah, yeah. I was gonna tell you it's okay if you don't want to go. It's just a small, little gallery. It's nothing, really. I'll bet you David is very proud. Oh, I... I forgot. It's okay. Hey, you didn't bring the checkers. No, I didn't today. Um, I did bring you this, though. I thought you might want to know. What's this? I... I can't believe it. The poor bastard. Suicide? Have you talked to him lately? Well, he did call me about a year ago to ask how I was and sent me the book. Did he call you? No, not since the trial. And, the funeral is tomorrow, so... Are you going? Come on, it's been five years. Do you think the others will be there? I don't know. Maybe. Seems like only yesterday... our brush with history. You know, some things history should forget. You should try reading that. I prefer to keep the past where it is. Listen, when you get to be as old as I am, the past is all you've got. I've got to get going. So soon? You just came. I have a lot of painting to catch up on. Do you have to go? I do, but I promise you I will bring checkers next time. Listen, you take care, huh? Well, you too. And you be nice to her. Hey, Bill. No, it won't take very much time. I just need someone to take a look at the door. Maybe it needs a new doorknob. Um, yeah. And then can somebody also check the wiring in the kitchen? The TV literally turned itself on today. Thanks. Oscar? Okay, thanks. Bye. Oscar! Oscar. Oscar. Oscar. Oscar. Come here, boy. Oscar, what are you doing? Do that again, and it's dry dog food. Aww. Why did you scare me like that? They are not dead who leave us this great inheritance for remembering joy. They still live in our hearts, in the happiness we knew and the dreams we shared. They still breathe in the lingering fragrance windblown from their favorite flower. They still smile in the moonlight's silver. And they laugh. They still speak in the echoes of the words we've heard them say again and again. They still move in the rhythm of waving grasses and the dance of billowing branches. They are not apart from us. They are a part of us, for love is eternal. Miss Price. Detective Michael Lyons, Homicide. Got a second to talk about Nathan? Homicide? I thought the papers said that he killed himself. Papers say a lot of things. He had a chart on the wall of his apartment... all the jurors from the Midnight trial. He did write a book. So you're saying you hadn't had any communication with him? Not in five years. Why did you come to his funeral? Detective, what are you trying to ask me? I was just wondering... of the 12 names, why yours was the only one circled. I just want to go home. When you feel up to it... Good morning, Frank. Time to rise and shine. Oh, Frank, how many times have I told you? Close this window. You're gonna catch a cold. Frank. We were on a jury together five years ago. Frank and I stayed in touch on and off. When he had a stroke, I... I really... you know, I tried to visit him as often as I could. I have his things here. He had no next of kin. Would you like to feed my birds? No, thank you. He's dead. They were late with the medicines this morning. They're never late with the medicines. His visitor will not be happy. I asked them to keep their voices down. I was trying to sleep. It was so late. What visitor? It's a big one. Aww, he's very hungry. Aren't you, fella? So many evils. What was that? I asked them to keep their voices down. I was trying to sleep. Would you like to feed my birds? Just as I thought... you're the only visitor listed. So it isn't possible for anyone else to have gotten in, not after hours? We lock the doors at 9:00 sharp for the safety of our residents, of course. Anyone who doesn't have a key card... Let me go. Cool it, would you? Knock it off. Bam! I had Parker slip me the results of your friend's autopsy... blunt force trauma, sustained on impact. No contusions or defensive wounds found. Yeah, what about the computer? The hard drive was ionized. Heads crashed. What could have caused that? Judging from the burn marks on the internal suppressor, I'd say a power surge. A power surge? Look, Mike, I know he was your buddy, but you've seen the kid's file. I searched that place from top to bottom. Parole violations, DUIs... And I couldn't even find a goddamn bottle of cough syrup. ...court-ordered rehab. It was just a matter of time. You need to take a step back, bro. You're getting a little too close to this thing. A phone call for you, Mike, on three. Take a message. It's Laura Price. Thanks. This is Detective Lyons. No, I hadn't heard. Okay, I'm on my way. What's up? That was the woman from the Midnight jury, - the one I spoke to after the funeral. - And? Another juror was found dead. I told Miss Price we lock the doors at 9:00 sharp. After that, no one comes in or out. That's Frank's room in the back. Would you mind fast-forwarding? What was that? It's an old system. That happens all the time. Can I get a copy of this? Yeah, sure. O Lord, we commit the body of this child to your safekeeping in eternal flame. Hey. Are you hungry? I'm hungry too. Come on, let's go. Oscar? Hold on. Sorry, there's no vacancies. No, I'm not here to rent an apartment. I'm here to see a friend's place. Okay, well, the call box is... right over there. I'm here to see the Palardis apartment. Okay, I'm gonna tell you the same thing that I told everyone else: I'm not letting anyone into his apartment, okay? Look, I'm not a reporter, okay? Uh, hold on. Please, just five minutes. The execution of Evan Lucas took place at 12:01 A.M., December 30th. ...and begin my second book covering the investigation of the Midnight case. I saw it again this afternoon. I - it seems to be stalking me wherever I go. I want to know what you heard in Frank's room. Well, have you brought any bread for my birds? No, this isn't about the birds. We need to talk about Frank. I... I don't know any Frank. Yes, Frank... he lived next door to you. - He passed away two nights ago. - Please, I don't... No, please. You said you heard talking. My birds would never hurt anyone. "So many evils"... what does it mean? I need to know. Oh, I... I d... evils. Excuse me. A word, please. A word. Our residents are nearing the end of their lives. They are tired and they are confused. She was not confused. I am sure that Miss McCarthy thought that she heard something. - She did hear something. - However, I will not allow you to continue to upset the residents. Fine. Just let me talk to her one more time. I am sorry, Miss Price, that is not going to happen. I need you to go. Now. I'm sorry. Sonia Martinez? Hi. It's Laura Price. We were on the jury together. Yeah, I saw you at the funeral the other day. I was hoping maybe we could get together. I want to talk to you about a few things. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, I can drive down too. Okay, thanks. Bye. Laura. - Hi, Sonia. - This is Eli. Hi, Eli. My name is Laura. - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - How have you been? - Good. Good. - Can I get my face painted? - Eli. - Please. - Okay. But Mommy's gonna stay here and talk with her friend, okay? Sonia... Frank's dead too. What? When? Two days ago. Mommy, I want to be a zombie. No, honey, nothing scary. Fine. They're saying that it's natural causes. But you don't believe them. I spoke to the woman that lived in the room next to Frank's and she said that she heard voices coming from his room the night he died. But I checked, and there was no one on the visitor log and there was nothing on the security cameras. Did she say what she heard? Yeah. The bizarre thing is that I got these texts the night that he died. "So many evils. " Yes. Did you get them too? What could they mean? Who...? Do you think it's possible that a spirit could contact you from beyond the grave? Oh. I don't know. Maybe. Why? Well, a couple of weeks ago, I started to get this sensation when I was alone, like someone was watching me. And my parish priest said that there's no such thing and I was just making it up in my head. But the strangest part is, "So many evils" is the last thing that Evan Lucas said before he died. What if he's come back? What if he wants revenge for what we did? He could come back for any one of us next. He... what is it? You see something, don't you? Eli! Eli, come here. - I'm not done. - Now. - Be careful. - Just go. Sweetie, we have to go. We can't do any face-painting. What? Dunbar? Directory assistance. City and state, please. San Francisco, for a Rob Dunbar. Please hold. I'm sorry, but that number has been disconnected. Is there a forwarding number or address? No, ma'am, I'm sorry. Okay, thank you. Hi. You've reached Sonia. Please leave a message. Sonia, it's Laura. Do me a favor, call me back as soon as you can, okay? It's really important. I'm gonna try your other number. Hello. - Hi. Is Sonia there? - Who is this? - This is Laura Price. It's really important. Oh, Laura, I'm sorry. Sonia passed away last night. What? We're having some people over to the house if you'd like to pay your respects. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Um, what's the address? Hi. Welcome. Thanks for coming. I can't believe she killed herself in her own house. What's going to happen to her son? The family... This is gonna be an interesting... She's with them now. You're next. Look. Two, three, four... they're dying in order, every three days. This is 3,000 miles away. I know, but I'm juror number five, so let's just pretend it might not be a coincidence. What do you mean, it might not be a coincidence? 'Cause Sonia said that she felt like she was being watched. And the woman from the nursing home said that she heard somebody talking to Frank the night he died. We watched the security tape together. - Yeah, I know. - And we didn't see anything. Well, nothing physical. Look, what if... what if he's back? Who? The Midnight Murderer... what if he's back? Laura, Evan Lucas is dead. 20 people saw him executed. I know. Trust me, I know. What if... what if somehow... somehow his spirit is trying to kill the people that are responsible for his execution? I promise you, I'm on top of this. Nothing's gonna happen to you, okay? I'll have Marin PD put somebody in front of your house 24/7. Right. Can I get you an escort home? Um, no. Thank you. Um, I'll just wait for your call. Thanks. We're closing in 15 minutes. Do you have any books on the supernatural... spirits, entities, anything like that? Downstairs, A-14. Thanks. 15 minutes. Professor Mylene Wolfe, San Francisco College. I think they're closing. A car accident, heart attack, two confirmed suicides, and you think someone actually killed these people? You were the detective in the Midnight case. If you're asking me if I believe in ghosts, the answer is no. What about copycats? It's a five-year anniversary. What if someone's trying to make a name for themselves? Mike. Four jurors, John. Maybe we should take a closer look. Our subject... a 45-year-old woman from Lake Charles, Louisiana... had noticed a strange glare in photographs that she had taken inside the home, as you can see here. That strange shape kept appearing in photo after photo after photo, but only in photographs that she had taken inside of her home. After she e- mailed me these, I decided to apply levels of spectral imaging to see if I could discern anything from the images. In each photo, the phenomenon was indicating a particular point in the house. Turns out that the subject's husband had died two months prior. And when she took a closer look, she found this. Unable to properly communicate his farewell to her in person, he'd written her a message and left it here for her to find. Lights, please. I want all of you to think of ghosts as remnants, shadows left behind by the recently departed. And if you open your mind just a little, you'll find that they have something to say. Oh, and don't forget to read chapter six for next time, please. Thank you. - Professor Wolfe. - Yes? - Hi. I'm Laura Price. - Hi. I was hoping you'd give me a few moments of your time. So the other juror in the case experienced this phenomenon as well? Yeah, she was convinced that it was the killer's spirit, that he's angry for what we did. People want to believe in the supernatural. They buy my books. They take my class. I've made a good living. But I want to be completely honest with you. 99% of the hauntings that I've investigated can be explained scientifically. How? Well, there was a laboratory in Oxford. Supposedly, it was haunted. But they found out that their equipment was emitting an ultra-low frequency capable of resonating in the human eye. The apparition was nothing but an optical illusion caused by infrasonic vibrations. Okay, what about the 1%? What about the 1% that can't be explained? Please, there's got to be something I can do. Entities are trapped here because they want something. They need something before they can move on. Maybe if you find out what that is, you'll be able to release it. Well, what if my entity... what if he wants to hurt me? What did you find? Hmm. St. John's Hospital. May I help you? Um... I need a doctor over here! Get him into 140. Excuse me, does Melissa Miller still work here? No, you're gonna have to wait. We're a few hands short. Get some Haldol over there! Just have a seat over here. I'll see what I can do. - Miss Miller? - Ma'am, we're a little busy. It's about Evan. Thanks for sitting down with me. I remember you from the trial. You sat in the front row, second from the left, always taking notes. You were pregnant. I heard about Nathan Palardis. I couldn't believe it. He was the foreman in the jury that convicted your boyfriend. You can't tell me that there wasn't a little part of you that was pleased. I never blamed any of you. Melissa... there's got to be over 20 calls on here between you and Nathan right before he died. What's this about? He reached out to me. Why? He wanted to know about Evan, about our relationship, how we met, the sorts of things we used to do together. Melissa, I know this might be really difficult, but it would be really helpful if you could tell me everything you told Nathan, okay? I told him we met at the store where he worked. I was trying to paint one of my sister's bedrooms. She had a baby on the way. And I remember she wanted this very particular shade of blue. I was there, you know, when they put the needle in his arm. I watched the chemicals pumping through the IV, knowing it was gonna kill him. In those final moments, he looked up at me through the glass... and he blew me a kiss. I miss him. I miss him so much. Melissa, do you remember his last words? He said, "If there is a god, whence proceed so many evils?" "If there is a god, whence proceed so many evils? If there is no god, whence cometh any good?" Boethius? "A Roman philosopher, was wrongfully imprisoned and sentenced to death. " Wrongfully imprisoned. Hey, there's a lady here to see you... uh, Lynn? Lacey? Laura. Yeah, that's it. Are you coming back or do you want me to close out your session? Huh. Hey. There's years' worth of research in here. I want to retrace Nathan's steps. I want to interview anyone and everyone who ever testified in this trial. I can't just reopen this case. Why? What if Nathan was onto something? What if something didn't add up? I think that's why he circled my name... because I was the only one who questioned anything during that trial. But ultimately you chose "guilty. " Yeah, I know. What if... what if we were wrong? What if we convicted the wrong man? Are you okay? Do you really think clearing Evan's name will save your life? I know that it sounds crazy, but, yeah, I do. Let's go. Everybody loved him. He was always very helpful. He was probably one of my best employees. How long did Evan work for you? About three years, I'd say. He started off as a clerk and then he worked his way on up to assistant manager. Mr. Harris, have you seen those spinner blades that came in this morning? I sure have. Did you check aisle 3? - Thanks. - Okay. The shipment of the murder weapon was traced back to this store. Yeah, it was a three-inch Healey fisherman. We still carry those. I'll show you. We go through about a case of those a month... collectors, fishermen. Heck, we even got a guy over in Sausalito... this guy... he can carve your initials right there in the tooth. - Can you believe that? - Wow. Did Evan have access to that key? All my employees do. Healey three-inch fisherman... there it is. This case is spotless. - Well, thank you. - How often, would you say, you clean it? We clean this at least once a week, pour the product out, wipe it down, and most importantly, make sure the blades are nice and shiny. Whose job would that be? That would be my assistant. So it would have been Evan's job? - At that time, yes, ma'am. - So if Evan cleaned the case... He would have gotten his fingerprints on the knife. You were fishing off Duxbury Reef the day the Midnight Murderer dumped his last victim? Yeah, he took her over to the edge of the dock, dumped her body in the ocean. Says you were interviewed by the police for over five hours. Yeah, that one detective, the black guy... Calloway? - Callendar. - Yeah, he was very thorough. Anyways, like he said on the stand, they found that poor girl's body wrapped in plastic exactly where I said it was. Is this what you were fishing the day you saw the killer? Yeah. Caught a couple monsters too... 25-30 pounds. The trick is, you put a sinker on the end of your line... it gets right down in there. How far offshore would you say you were? I don't know, about 100 feet. Yeah, that's weird. Why? I used to fish with my dad when I was a little girl, and that, my friend, is cod. Yeah. And? And the schools concentrate out on the shelf, and that's no less than 700 feet away, wouldn't you say? Is that true? Look, I know what I saw. The guy was well-built, kind of tall. Did you actually see his face? Ask Callendar. I ID'd the photo. What color eyes did he have? Did you see what color his eyes were? Look, lady, I could never have seen that, not even from 100 feet away. Really? Because I remember you on the stand saying they were hazel. Mark Gannon... there's a name I haven't heard in a while. Hey, why don't you guys come back in the cage? Yeah, he was transferred after his testimony at the Midnight trial. Lucky him... Pleasant Valley down in Fresno. Yeah, here we go. Uh, arrested for breaking and entering, assault and battery, attempted murder. This guy gets a transfer. Says here he testified for the prosecution in four criminal trials in addition to the Midnight case. Why, he's a real advocate for justice, isn't he? Eh, these guys are locked up in cement boxes 23 hours a day. They start talking. Everyone does. Mark saw an opportunity. Would you have his visitor log by chance? Yeah, I should. You think someone told Mark what to say in exchange for the transfer? Yeah, I do, just like I think somebody told the fisherman what color Evan's eyes were. Well, you know, this is what frustrates me. - What's that? - The log... it's missing. So what do we have? Looks like a forensic investigator testified that Evan's prints were present on both the blade and the handle. Well, that could have happened at the store. Yeah, but according to Nathan's notes, there were also several partial prints that were never matched. That wasn't in the forensic testimony. Including one on one of the bags pulled out of the landfill. And one more thing... Evan's girlfriend told Nathan the police served a search warrant at their apartment, took several items with them, except there's no reference to anything in the evidence log. They just disappeared. Wow. They covered it up. Yeah. Can you imagine being convicted, being executed for something you didn't do? Evan's put to death. The prosecutor Charles Richardson is serving his second term as D.A. If it were me, I'd want revenge. Tomorrow's day three. What are we gonna do? We're gonna finish this. So what do you think? I worked for over a year on that case, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, dozens of suspects. You want to tell me what was so urgent, you had to wake me up in the middle of the night? Look, I'm obviously not a detective. No. You have a witness who clearly lied about what he saw, partial prints on the murder weapon that weren't even accurately examined, and evidence that just kind of disappeared. Hmm, and a jailhouse confession in which Lucas told his cellmate everything... how he chose his victims, where he hid the bodies. You don't think Mark Gannon could have read that in "The Examiner"? Including the details we didn't release to the public? You know, I don't mean any disrespect, Detective. Did you actually interview Mr. Gannon yourself? Tell me she's not serious. Of course I did. Was that before or after somebody told him what to say? Are you listening to this? Come on, John, you gotta admit there are a couple of holes in the case. A couple? Come on. Midnight Murderer had the whole city on edge. Every time you turned on the TV or opened a newspaper, we were pulling another body out of the bay. You know, people were afraid to go outside. They stopped going to work. Kids stopped going to school. Was there pressure from the D.A. to wrap it up? Absolutely. Did I cut a few corners? Possibly. But before you come down on me, waking me up in my own home, you need to remember one thing. And what's that? The moment we took Evan Lucas, put him into custody, the murders stopped. No. No. Well, you just tell them I'm not gonna budge, not for that. No. No, they're gonna have to work a little bit harder. Sorry, that's the way it is. - Charles. - I'll call you back. - Hey, John, good to see you. - You too, buddy. We missed you at the fund-raiser last month. Yeah, well, listen, I need to talk to you about Evan Lucas. Hey, I'm a busy man. You know what? Why don't you call Amy, set up a lunch? We'll go to Danko. You like that. No, no, I mean now. - Now? - Now. Now. All right, well, if you don't mind talking in my other office. After you. All right, so what's troubling you, John? Don't tell me that juror suicide has you spooked. Hmm, you heard about it. Half the people in my office are talking about it. They think there's a curse, if you believe in that kind of thing. I don't. You? I believe in two things, John: justice and the death penalty. Everything else is just smoke and mirrors. So what's this really about? Mark Gannon. Yeah, he's doing life in Fresno last time I heard. Eh, minimum security. The guy's 5'4". He's got arthritis worse than my grandmother. I still think he had the right friends. These are hardened criminals, John. We're not gonna win them over with "please" and "thank you. " You're right. Hey, did you know his visitor's log in the jailhouse archives was missing? Half the city's understaffed. Clerical's a mess. I don't even know how I do my job. Yeah, so I checked the front logs. You want to guess who visited him right before he gave up Evan's confession? Five years later, and you want to have this conversation now? - Did you coach him, Charles? - You were with me. You know the evidence better than I do. It wasn't enough, not until the cellmate came forward... came forward and told everybody Evan confessed. We convicted a guilty man. You swore to me. You assured me that you had testimony proving his guilt. That was a lie. I suppose your conscience would prefer more people die. Like Evan Lucas? What are you gonna do, John, huh? Destroy your reputation, jeopardize everything you've spent your whole career building? I'm just gonna deny everything. Because that's what politicians do best now, isn't it? City Hall was rocked today with the unexpected revelation that evidence may have been manipulated in the infamous Midnight Murderer case, a conspiracy... A conspiracy which goes all the way up to District Attorney Charles Richardson himself, who is accused of tampering with the key witness. Meanwhile... Meanwhile, the judge is currently reviewing the evidence against Evan Lucas, who was executed for the murders two years ago. Hi. This is Laura. Please leave me a mess... Hello. Hey, Vick. Yeah, I changed it. What's up? Oh, I can't. I have plans tonight. Michael's here. Yeah. Well, tomorrow, okay? Tomorrow. Bye. That was my girlfriend Vicki... the one that works at the art gallery. She may be doing the background check on you right now. I'm just letting you know. Well, unfortunately one of the side effects of being a cop is you tend to lead a pretty boring personal life. Well, after the week I've had, I can handle boring. I'll show you how this works. Here. Really? Let me see if I can do it. I'm not sure. Um... Yeah, okay. Thank you. What time is it? What? What time is it? Um, 2:00. Why? Day three. You were right. - Clearing his name saved your life. - Mm-hmm. Maybe now he's at peace. And you? Getting there. Hey, it's me. Call me back ASAP. I think I found something. He told us where you hid the bodies. I don't know what you're talking about. Look, this... is that your knife? Hey, we've got a witness saying he saw you take the Hamilton girl off Duxbury Reef, toss her body in the water. No, man. No way. You know, the next time your girl is gonna see you, they're gonna be sticking a needle in your arm. Fine. You don't want to play? Fine. We'll do it your way. I can't help you, homie. Great. Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detective! Detec... Hi. Is everything okay? I got a message from John. He's not picking up. I'll be back before lunch. Oh, before lunch? Okay. Yeah. Before lunch. John. John. John. - Where are all the files? - They're gone. He wasn't supposed to take those. Captain's gonna have a field day. Excuse me. Nice work, John. You photographed all the files. Son of a bitch. Officer, do me a favor. I need you to call down to Santa Cruz, see if they found any prints. - Also see if the knife matches. - Detective? - Just do it. - I'm on it. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Hi. This is Laura. Please leave me a message. Hey, it's me. You're still in danger. You have to get out of the house. Please call me. - Lyons. - The knife used in the Martinez suicide was the same as the Midnight case. - What about prints in the tub? - Got a match in our files. - Which one? - Evan's boss George Harris. Hello, Laura. I knew Nathan was close to finding the truth, Laura. But it would have been too risky to just kill him. So I decided to come out of retirement... the Midnight Murderer back from the grave, killing off the jury in order. And you, Laura... you're number five. Are you in there, Laura? Laura? Are you in there, Laura? Open the door. Where are you hiding, Laura? Where could you be? Laura, Laura, you naughty girl. Laura! Where are you? Laura. Laura. Put the knife down! Are you okay? How are you holding up? Better. This whole time he was trying to keep us safe. George. I heard. Evan wanted me to tell you thank you. I'm just sorry we couldn't have helped him earlier. There's something else. What? He said your son is there with him... and that he is looking forward to being with his mommy when the time comes. Until then, he'll keep an eye on him for you. Well, you tell him to tell Jacob that there's not a minute that goes by in my day that I don't think about him. Tell him that his mommy loves him very much. I will.
