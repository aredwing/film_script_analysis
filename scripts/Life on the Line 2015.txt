The company Generates most of the Texas network modernization And it is also the biggest project we've had to do. What awaits you is no picnic. God knows that this business is not easy. But the network has more than 30 years. And we must renew entirely before the storm season. It is not too hit the street, But lineman is the 4th most dangerous occupation.

Thank you. Your command. Thank you, darling. Why did you do your asshole with me? Asshole... Really? What do we do? It seems that has separated. You're going off to college, anyway. You were always too strong to school. It was sure you were going to end up leaving. Do you remember that day at the school where your heel broke, Was all embarrassed you, you wanted to walk. You must have been afraid of being poor. As my family. - Do not say that. - Do you remember ? You remember... I went to the workshop pick you. Remember? You told me that I was a gentleman. It had never told me that before. You were one. I'm not sure. Why have you been so long Asking me to go out with you after high school? I do not know. What are you waiting for go to college? That's good. We end this. This is for you. I have for a second. Gentlemen. I heard about the incident yesterday. It's annoying. It has lost almost 3 hours. This kind of thing can seriously Make us late. Our employer is aware. And that's boring. It should be more careful. I hope you're kidding. I'm just extra careful. I'm doing it. My job is to pay attention. Do more attention. You want another team leader? - All right. - I did not say that. Yesterday I almost got killed. I can leave my place. I have not said that. I am sorry. The utility enterprise has poorly maintained the network And my guys put their lives. And I'm breaking my ass With kids to the TAF. You know what? The utility can go fuck himself. - You can tell them. - OK, Beau. It was nice talking to you. Hi, neighbor. We drank? Eugene works? Yes. He left a few days. Sometimes I feel I never see him. It's not easy being the wife of a lineman. Or niece. You got lucky. You got great kids, a husband, a beautiful home. Since Eugene returned from Iraq, it's more... As before, between us. It was the war? It not want to talk, but it's the same. Sometimes I have the impression he is absent Even when he is at home. Our life is not as perfect as that. Well... I thought it would. You have not touched your glass. I not drink much. Did you expect what? I have never lost a man on my team. Not one. Think we welcome a me for this? Fontaine? He is worried. That's all. There's something to be worried, stashed in his office. You do not know. There are risks to not move the ass of the day. Low testosterone, the fat belly. Hey, why you put yourself in that state? I thought Danny. I can not stop thinking about him. I should have been in his place. I know the chorus and I not like it. It's not you who live with that. Hey, buddy, I was there too. As far as I know, it's not you who controls lightning. Damn. Mr. Ginner, okay? Let alone Bailey. She projects. She has no need for a ball like you. It's not very nice. If it goes, it's because of you. I not let her go out with you. One returns. Hi, Beautiful People. Okay? I'll see that with Russell. I'm on it. Well, precisely. You wanted to see me? Russell, we are far behind our schedule. Bill, is made as quickly as we can. Just look at it with Beau. Listen... Beau is a little too old school, Straddling settlement. I'm not saying it poorly, but accelerate. In 2 weeks, transport and distribution must arrive The post 12. And for now Were delayed everywhere. I know Beau 22 years. I work with him because he is good. For our part, we will be ready. Do not worry. Eugene, you come early. What are you doing? Fouille not my business. There are numbers of messages that I do not know. This is the friends I made when you were not there. Like who? I went out with Bailey, opposite the next. And friends to it. Where you going? Make my suitcase. I'm leaving soon. You're kidding! You just got back. - Can I ask you a question? - Yes. Have you spent time with my wife? Yes, it was seen. With your friends too? My Friends? Eugene, stop bothering Bailey. I see too your friends hang out here. With my friends. Okay. Sorry. It's nothing. Thank you, baby. Ladies. I have a gift. It's not worth it. Thank you. Hey, you want to help me and talk to him? Go. Look at least what it is. I have work. - It's not true! - I just want to talk to you. Let go my arm. OK. - I just wanted to talk to you. - OK. What does he want? It's okay ? Yes. We will clean it. One morning I see her nails done. There were everywhere on the carpet. Sorry. Thank you. - Do you like to be a mother? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. That's wonderful. Finally, it is not easy every day. Is not sleeping much, especially when they are babies. That does not leave much time for anything else. You? I'm going to college. So I do not have time for that. - You still wood. - No. I'm not too keen. - You want to talk? - What? Who is the father? It is a lineman. It is not even aware. My uncle hates him. What you gonna do? I know. Your turn. What? I saw you. Getting into a taxi in front of you. Nothing can hide among girls. I'll order another. Go. - Here we go. Beware of steps. - Oh yes. Ready? 1, 2... Okay? - It's okay. - Then continue. One arrives... Well, well, well. What beauties like you do here No men with them? You know how you got the feeble air? Go liberates cowboy. What if I do not want?

I'm going to buy a pickup. And this... This is for you, for college. Duncan, I can not accept. - I want you to guard. - Do you need. Why? I'm not good enough for you? That's what you think? Not me. Really? I'm not just a hobby before college? Why do not you want me? It's just the opposite. That's what you want? I'm pregnant. You say nothing? Bailey Ginner expect my child. Bailey Ginner expect my child! What I want is to be with you, if you feel like it. - I feel like it. - Yes ? You sure? My dream may be to stay here and marry a lineman. They not maintain the network, and afterwards, we reproach. You're very silent. You told me not used to that. What is it? What? I'm pregnant. Well... I'll pretend I had not heard. You just said you were pregnant? You're joking, I hope. But by God! Contraception, you do not know? I will not have high like that. Oh no. It's him ? It's not true! Is Duncan? That's what I want. That's what you want, a poor guy who has nothing to give you? - It's not a jerk. - Really ? It is a lineman. As you. As your father. As my father. I love you. I love you more than anything. But not tell me what I should do with my life. That's what I want. I went to my mother on the day of the storm. It must have been a day of celebration. I was going to say to me and Bailey and...
