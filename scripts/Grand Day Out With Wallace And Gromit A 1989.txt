Let's have a nice hot cup of tea, hmm? Kettle should have boiled by now. [humming] No cheese, Gromit. Not a bit in the house. Gromit, that's it: cheese! We'll go somewhere where there's cheese. Now, where were we? Places you find cheese. Lancashire, Cheddar, Wensleydale, Philadelphia, Tesco's... Everybody knows the Moon's made of cheese. [sniffing] [hinges creaking] [water dripping] [mice squeaking] [humming] Hmm. Vroom! Oh! Hmm. [whistling] Whew! [drill whirring] - [yelps] [electronic beeps] - [clears throat] [whistling a tune] [pulsating electronic humming] [whistling a tune] Everything seems to be under control... [crash] [groaning] [fuse crackling] [clock ticking and dinging] Hmm. Oh, unlock the doors. [rumbling] Oh! Mm! No crackers, Gromit. We've forgotten the crackers! [groans] Hold on, Gromit. Hold on! [clock ticking and dinging] [panting] [alarm rings] Huh? [all sniffing] [rumbling] Oh. Gromit! [triumphant music] # # Hmm. [sighs] [whistles a tune] [squeaking] [flash bulb pops] One for the album. [engines whirring] Huh? Oh. Nicely done. [gulps] [klaxon honking] Huh? Oh! [chuckles] Huh? Adjust angle of thrust. Steady, now. Even up. Steady. [rumbling] Gently does it. [thud] [sighs] A nice drop of tea to get the taste buds going. Mmm. Ah. Plate. Knife. Cracker. [mutters] See what you think. - [sniffs] - Wensleydale? Stilton? I don't know, lad. It's like no cheese I've ever tasted. Let's try another spot. [humming] Hmm. Aha. Come on, stupid! Oh! Oh, daylight robbery. They always nick your money, them flipping machines. Come on, Gromit. [static buzzing] [announcer speaking] [peppy music] # # [metallic clank] [metallic clang] [machinery creaking] Mmm, it's different. Hmm. Oh... Hmm? Camembert? Ooh! Oh? Oh. [humming] Where are you off to now? Leave me to carry the basket, won't you? [peppy music] Huh? [dramatic music] [rattling and squeaking] Emergency countdown! Ten seconds and counting! Hold tight, lad, and think of Lancashire hotpot. [alarm rings] [metal clangs] Huh? What? Oh! Oh, the fuse! You forgot to light the fuse!
