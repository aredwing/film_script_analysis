"Cruel one, don't look at me." "Your city dwellers are being ruined." "My salacious youth might fade, come." "My salacious youth might fade, come." "Kohl." "Your kohl eyes." "Your kohl eyes." Come on, mama! "Your kohl eyes." Shivani, you naughty girl! You made me dance! You have to practice! I will show you now! You naughty girl! You should get the award of the naughtiest girl in the world. Do you know? - Oh, really, mama! Thank you! Shut up! You are not ready to exercise. And you made me dance. Listen, you have to participate in the dance contest. Not me. Do it once more, Shivani! Please! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! - No, mama! Start! On one condition! On one condition! - What? If you give the answer of my question, only then. Ask your stupid riddle. What is the difference between bus stand and cycle stand? Cycle stand? What is the difference? You catch bus at the bus stand! And at the cycle stand... Yes! I knew that! No! The bus stand's stand remains fixed. But cycle stand's stand goes with it. So you lose, mama! And I am not going to practice. "Have a drag!" Bye! This girl always fools me! But I always come first! Okay! Bye! Can't you see and drive? What if there had been an accident? Sorry, ma'am! My mistake! No mistake! Show me your licence! I don't have the license. But I have this. Will it do? Are you bribing me? No. I thought its new milky flavour so... No problem! Neena will have it. Am I right, Neena? As such I wouldn't have taken! But today I will accept it. What are you doing, Shivani? We are getting late. She is taking the bribe from me. If you had chocolate before the race, then how will you run? It is children's race at the club get together. Not some Olympics. Neena, every race is important. Where is Sudeep? Like always! Big meeting! Big contract! Big talks! Bye! - Bye! - Bye, aunt! If you won the race then you will get a surprise gift. Gift? - Yes! What gift? - Surprise gift! Yeah! Yeah! Drink! Drink! What are you thinking? Drink! Your attention, please! Parents are requested to clear the running area. Now the track event will begin with 100 meters race. So all the participates, take your position. All the best! On your marks! Get set! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shi! Child. Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! What happened? Are you okay? I am sorry, mama! Next time I will surely come first. No, dear. It's okay, my child. It's okay. Its okay! Its okay! Mama, please! Shivani! I don't know why people make a mountain out of a molehill! Deepu! Shivani fell down! What happened? She is sitting here. Nothing has happened to her. Papa! - Yes! Today you are going to be beaten! You think I am scared? You think I am scared? Don't come to me! I won't save you! Shivani! Stop! Listen! I yell just like that! I get angry very soon! Beloved! - Your beloved is dead! I called you and you disconnected! No! No, Roshni! Listen! The meeting is dearer to you than me and your child! Get out! - Listen to me! No! I don't want to hear anything! Go and make arrangement for your tomorrow's conference! Tomorrow I don't have any conference! I... Then make one! But tomorrow I and Shivani are going for a holiday! Holiday! Yes! For 10 days! Where? Hell! Nice place to go! Hell! Am I right! You will come to know after I leave tomorrow! You are going to the lioness, papa? - Yes! Best of luck! Papa! Impress her! Goodnight! Don't try to touch me! Otherwise I will raise chaos! Is that so? And what will you say? That a man deliberately barged into my room! And he is trying to do all that which actually even I want to do. And the man who has barged in, he is a smart man. And who incidentally is my only husband. Don't try to act smart, mister architect. Your building plans are more important than your wife. I have other plans too. They are very interesting and romantic too. Romance my foot! You know... that my romance lies in your feet. Don't irritate me, Sudeep! From Mr. Architect you have progressed to Sudeep! Now gradually you will drop Su! And only Deepu will be left. Then something else too will be dropped. I don't feel like laughing. Fine. You will feel like laughing if I said sorry. Fine! If I hold my ears then you will laugh. No? If I say that I have got Shogans contract... ...meaning your husband has got it. And this husband wants loads of love and congratulations... ...then will you smile a bit? Fine! If I say that from tomorrow I am on a 10 days leave. And we all three will go for a vacation, then will you smile? Really? No! I said it just to entice you! Go to sleep! You are so mean! I don't know about tomorrow! But I know that where I am going to take you today. Where? - To heaven! To heaven! With love! Deepu! Mauritius? - Yes! Are you mad? Why? Only mad people go to Mauritius? No! That is not what I meant! But what is the need to go so far away? Fine! We won't go walking! We will go by air! And listen! I have told Sam to book the ticket. We are going to Mauritius in the next week! Okay! You have told him? - Yes! Deepu, look! It's so beautiful! Isn't it nice? And quite expensive too! After 3 years we are going on a holiday! Miser! I mean to say there is an emergency in the office! Office! - Sorry! Office! Sorry. Sorry! We will go to Mauritius! Okay! Done! Done! Mauritius! Mama! - Dear! We are going to Mauritius! - We won't go to Mauritius! Shut up! - Shut up! Why? - Why? Look! I don't want to see! We will go here! - Here! Do you know where this house is? Of course, I know! This is the big house! Am I right, mama? Yes! Dear, but we don't live here! That reminds me... Sameer was saying that... ...somebody is interested in buying this house. Really? - Yes! We won't sell our house. We will go here. Come on, dear. Why will we go there for a vacation? Look, this is so lovely. We will go here! To our house! Behave yourself, Shivani! We won't go there! I will have to do everything there! I also want to enjoy my holiday! We won't go there! We won't go there! Mama, I will do all your chores! No means no! Okay! What has happened to her? If she wants then let's go. We will return in 2-3 days. Then we will go to Mauritius. Okay. Promise! - Promise! Shivani! You win! We will go where you want to go! But on one condition! Quickly come and give a nice hug to mama and papa! Yes! Come! Come! Love you, mom! Love you, dad! Since when I was saying to go for a vacation. But your mummy has no time. Look, who is talking! Very bad! Very, very, very bad! Bad! Dear, at last you made us do your bidding! Thank you, mom! My daddy too! Hi, Sam! - Roshni, where are you? Sam... I am waiting for you in the office! I had told you! But you said that you are going to Mauritius after two days! And suddenly you made the plan to go to your old house. What is he saying? Sam! Don't yell at my wife! Did you hear! And you come with Neena and Jia. - Yes! Sudeep, try to understand! Here there is so much work pressure. I thought you guys are going after 2 days. But in the morning Roshni messaged me. That I am going today. What is this? Hello, uncle Sam! - Hi, sweetheart! Uncle Sam, shall I say what my mama tells you everyday! What do you mean? What does she say? You need a break, Sam! Bye! Shivani! Shivani, wear the jacket! Let her go! We have reached home! Greetings, ma'am! Greetings, sir. - How are you? Hello, uncle Ram Singh! Not Ram Singh! Ram Singh's son Bheem Singh! How come she knows my name? She has come here for the first time! Who doesn't know you? Sir, what do I tell you? My personality is such! Go and bring the luggage! Go. Ram Singh, how did the window break? I am fed up, sir! I have changed the glass three times! But it breaks before I change it! Do you still work like how you used to work? What are you saying, ma'am? - Wow! I don't get the time! It's such a big house. It takes me the whole day to clean it! I don't even get the time to rest. Have you cleaned the room? Or is it still untidy? Ma'am, I have cleaned it spic and span. You will be pleased to see it. You reached here first. Ram Singh, will you make tea for me? How will he make it? He is no more. I am Ram Singh's son... - Bheem Singh. Bheem Singh, will you please make tea for me? I will just make it. I will make delicious tea. You will love it. Thank you. Come on You have settled down. But this is not your room. You will have to go to your room. Yes! Shivani, this is your mama and my room. Your room is there. Go and ask uncle Bheem Singh. But I want to sleep in this room. This is my room. I see! So you will sleep here! Where will we sleep? You people will also sleep here! No! Not at all! You always sleep in your room! So today too you will sleep like that! Come on! Come on! I want to sleep in this room! I want to sleep in this room! I want to sleep in this room! This is my room! I want to sleep here! - Shivani! What has happened to her? - What will happen? Your pampering has spoilt her. - I... Please! You have become very stubborn! Roshni! Shivani wants to sleep in this room! So let her sleep! She wants to sleep! - Let her sleep! Thank you! - Go to sleep! - Go to sleep! Come on! Come on, Roshni! This is Shivani's room! - Yes! Bye! - Bye! Deepu, you shouldn't pluck flowers in the night. Then what do you do in the night? You have a one track mind! Roshni! - Yes! We had begun our lives here, right? We fought with papa here. Papa is still angry with you. Yes, he is angry with his son. But he loves his daughter-in-law a lot. Roshu! Roshni! Yes! Love you! Oh! - All this is not allowed here! - Is that so? Because a sweet child was inside alone. - I see! Who is this sweet child? - Who is this sweet child? Is it her! Is it her! Is it her! Sweet child! Sweet child! Sweet child! Did she go to sleep? Yes! With great difficulty! She has become very stubborn! I don't know what has happened! Roshu! - Yes! You work so hard! Come! I will help you! What are you doing? Do you know? Yesterday I read in a magazine. For a strong heart you should have romantic nights. Shut up! Go to sleep! What happened? Deepu! Just for our healthy heart's sake! "Have a drag." Carefully. What is this, uncle Ram Singh? Not Ram Singh! Bheem Singh! Bheem Singh! Don't say that! Otherwise the glass will again break! This time I have bought an unbreakable glass. It will again break, uncle Bheem Singh! - O my God! Dear, how will it break? I have bought it here carefully. I will stick it with Fevicol! O my God! The spice! - Salt. Salt. Deepu, salt is to be added later! Who is the cook? - You! When to add the salt? Come on! Come on! Salt! Salt! Quick! Salt! Here! Yes! Yes! Yes! How much? - Papa! Laugh! You will come to know when the food is ready! You will lick your finger! Yes, yes! Nothing else will be left to lick! Shut up! Shut up! How did this glass break? O my God! Is he cooking or fighting with the vessel? Where is the closest Pizza Hut? I understand English. But very less. Hut means a hut. What is pizza? Tomato sauce! Quick! Quick! Quick! Tomato sauce! Swing! Swing! Mummy, please put up the swing! If I left the kitchen... then the slight chance of getting... ...edible food, we will lose that too. Got it? Mummy, swing! Mummy, swing! Mummy, swing! Sauce! - Mummy, swing! Mummy, swing! Dear, tell uncle Bheem Singh! How many times I have said that... Bheem Singh... Let's go, dear! "Love is crazy." Carefully! Sit and check whether it is fine! Its fine, uncle Bheem Singh! So the swing is ready! Mummy, swing me! Mummy, swing me! O my God! - Bheem Singh! I fell down! I don't know why your papa becomes stubborn at times! Yeah! Today we will have to fast! Don't laugh! You too are stubborn! Like father like daughter! No matter what I say... you both do the opposite! I said let's go to Mauritius! And you wanted to come here! I said I will cook! And papa started cooking! Shivani! Shivani! Don't go so higher! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Roshni! Roshni! Roshni! Roshni! Roshni! Roshni! What happened? Shivani! - What happened to Shivani? Up... swing... Shivani! Wow! Shivani, get down! Mama! Come on! Get up! What's there up? God knows! Shivani! Mama, I don't want milk! Mama! - Yes! Today you got scared in the morning, right? Sorry! Mama, I am sorry! Mama! Mama, sing that Neenu's song! "It's come." "It's come." "When you came in my world." "My small and sweet doll." "I will keep you safe and sound." "I will keep you safe and sound." "Nobody should cast an evil eye on you." "I will hide you." "It's come." "When you came in my world." Roshu, after so many days I heard your lullaby. What happened? Are you still disturbed? Come and sleep, you will be fine by morning. Come, come, come. Deepu, something seems to be wrong. It is not just the swing incident. I mean... other than that... I don't know. I have called Sam. - Roshu. Please. He will arrive tomorrow. Diya and Neena too. Fine. - Come. Come on. Go to sleep now. Let's do one thing. Now I will sing a lullaby for you. You will never fall asleep. You were asleep. I woke up. Like father like daughter. And now father and daughter will work together. Isn't it? - Yes. Mummy is asleep. - Yes. Alone. - Alone! Who else can it be? Who? Who? Who? Do you want to see papa's township? I want to. - You want to, come on. Now Shivani will see papa's design, just a minute. She will see papa's design and say, how is papa's creation. right. Look, this is the plan. And... there will be many offices here. And here too. And... look here, this will be the township's entrance. And this will be a shopping complex. And here, there will be a big hotel. And behind this building will be a big playground. And this way... do you know what will be the name... ...of this township? - What? Shivani Township. And this will be our house. And there will be a lot of houses here. No dear, I haven't thought about buying a house here. Not another one, this house. How can this house be there Shivani? And anyway, we are about to sell this house. This is our house. This house will be there! Shivani, how can this house be there? This house is here I want this house! I want this house! I want this house! Shivani! - I want this house! I want this house! - Behave yourself. I want this house! I want this house! Shivani, stop it Stupid. Have you gone mad Look, what you have done. Look, look Now we won't take you anywhere for vacation. We are going back tomorrow. Roshni! Roshni! Deepu! Deepu, what... Wait here dear! Papa. Shivani. Papa was scared! Papa was scared! Papa was scared! Papa was scared! Papa was scared! O God! Gauri. You had made something like this too, isn't it? You cannot recollect it, isn't it mama. 'What are you doing?' 'Okay, so you are thinking about a child.' 'Roshu, on one hand we are thinking... ...that we won't start a family for 3 years.' 'And on the other hand you think about family planning.' 'Of course we won't start a family for 3 years.' 'But it feels nice to think about it.' 'And you have also though it will be a girl.' 'Yes, it will be a girl.' 'And her name will be Gauri.' 'Gauri, it is a very nice name.' 'But it will happen when we will be settled.' 'And not here, in Mumbai.' We have to make a plan. I love you. Listen to me, after you leave tomorrow... ...when will you return from the training? It will take at least 1 1 /2 - 2 months. O God. - What happened? For the next 1 1 /2 months you will have to bathe alone. Deepu. Hello. - Hi my darling, are you missing me. Deepu. - Roshu, what happened? Deepu, when are you returning? What has happened? - Nothing. Actually, I had gone to the doctor today. - Yes. He said I am pregnant. O God. Roshu... - I don't know... But we... - We don't want a child now Deepu. Roshu don't worry, it is still not late. I am returning in 2 days. We will go to the doctor and... But... papa. I will talk to papa, you don't worry. Let me return, everything will be fine. - Okay. Love you Deepu. - Love you too. Come Mohan, come. For me. ok. I have arrived, but tell me why are you giving this surprise party? Yesterday I got the best news of my life. - Really. I am going to be a grandfather. - Really. This is for you. Congratulations! - Congratulations! Coming, coming Tripathi. Coming. How are you sir? Ok. You have given real good news. It's Gods grace. What happened, Roshni? This is not right? Papa arranged a party for this occasion too. But Sudeep and I didn't want this child. Its okay Roshni, be relaxed. I am so happy for Sudeep, uncle. So happy. But... When are you starting a family? I don't have the courage... We are making up our mind. To tell anything to papa. First I want to make my career and then... Just look, how happy papa is. Yes. This surprise party... Sudeep has arrived. Congratulations Sudeep. Congratulations. Sudeep, congratulations. What's going on? - As if you don't know anything. Everyone knows... - What? You are about to become a father. My son. Papa. Sudeep. - Sudeep. Sudeep, please What is all this Roshni? - Actually... We had decided to abort the child? - Yes. You said yes. If you didn't want to get the abortion done... ...you should have told me. - Sudeep. Here, do you know... - Sudeep, please. Please try to understand. Please. It is not like that. This is not my will. Papa is stubborn about it. Sudeep, papa is very ill. If I would have told him, that I want to abort the child... ...it would have been like killing him. No Roshni, it is wrong not to tell him. What will you do now? Give birth to the child, so that papa's health is fine. What about our future, let it be ruined. You don't care about it. Sudeep please. - No Roshni. - Sudeep... Don't worry son. I am not that weak, that I will die because of... ...a single decision taken by you and daughter-in-law. I am sorry papa. I know you are hurt. But we are not ready for our child. - Oh, I see. Our careers have still not started and... Why do you new generation people think... ...that a child will stop your progress. - Papa. Or you will lose your freedom. A child is a Gods gift, at least don't do that with God. Please don't do that with us. Please make us... feel guilty by saying all that. We don't want a child now. It is not a big thing these days. She will abort the child now and then whenever... So that's your decision. So basically you want to kill the child. There is no need to dramatize it, papa. You would always ask me, papa... ...why don't I have a younger brother or sister! I will tell you today! At that time, our condition was such... ...that we were ready for only one child. But I made sure that I don't make a mistake. It is not a dramatization son, you lack responsibility! Papa. - I know. It is a magical moment, when a miracle takes birth in the womb! You want to kill that miracle! Why? Because you feel, as it is still not born it is not alive! If it is not alive, then why is there activity in your womb? I am asking you! Papa, no one else can understand this pain better. But, we are still not ready for this child papa. In future, there will be a sweet adorable baby in front of you. And you will call it, my child. My life, my sweetheart, the apple of my eye. You want... - Papa, I don't think we want to discuss this anymore! Okay, I am going. Anyway, I feel suffocated in your lifestyle. I will tell the guests that, there is no surprise. Papa. Good luck, to both of you. Roshni, I know what you are going through. I don't want to assert any right on you. If you don't want to get the abortion done, then so be it. We both took the decision of aborting the child. Then how can I change my decision. And even if I give birth to this child. And if she finds out we didn't want to give birth to her. Will he ever forgive us? No, isn't it Deepu. My decision is still the same Deepu. I... will get the abortion done. Papa. You were right, I can never forgive you. Now did you recognise me? Mama, papa. Gauri. Yes papa, Gauri. The Gauri that had heard the decision of her death. In the place, the child feels most protected. In her mothers womb, isn't it mother. Are you scared of me? You feel so affectionate when you see Shivani. And you are scared to see me. I wanted love, but Shivani got the love. I would think everyday, maybe today... ...you will feel affectionate towards me. But that didn't happen. Every time you adorned Shivani... ...you would put a 'bindi' on her forehead. You would celebrate her birthday grandly. You would pick her up in your arms lovingly. I would feel jealous of her. I was in your womb for 3 months. But I would fear everyday that you might kill me today. I would cry, but only God would hear my teardrops fall. Now I will do what you did with me. In the next 3 days, I will torture you the same way... ...give you the same fear, that I got. And on the third day, I will take your Shivani... ...you dear daughter along with me. Just 3 days. Come on. Where are we going? Keep quiet dear, we are going home. And Shivani, won't you take her along? Papa. Were you trying to leave fooling me? I told you, you cannot go anywhere before 3 days. No where. Mama, did you hear that sound? Papa, did you? The sound of Shivani crying. God. Papa, go and see where Shivani is. Go! Go! Shivani! Shivani! Mama. Mama. Mama! Mama was scared! Mama was scared! Mama was scared! Mama was scared! Mama was scared! Mama was scared! Mama was scared! Mama was scared! Mama was scared! What happened papa. Nothing... dear. Then why are you standing here? We... I will warm the milk and bring it. Yes. Mama. Mama, do you know what I saw today? So small, no such a small bird. It was in the nest. It was very sweet. They must have just born. Where were they before that? In the egg. In such a small egg. Yes, like I was here. Go to your papa, dear. "Two little gentlemen sat on a wall..." "One named Peter and other named Paul..." "Fly away Peter, fly away Paul..." Papa, why aren't you reading the paper? I will tell you dear? Look. It is so, the bird, the mother bird... ...it sits on the egg and hatches it. And then the children come out. Did I ask you? Do one thing Ram Singh uncle... - Call me Bheem Singh. At least you call me Bheem Singh. Fine, sorry. Bheem Singh, will you please leave now. Deepu. I don't know why, whenever Shivani comes close. It feels very strange. It feels as if... - She is not our Shivani. I am very scared. We are scared of our own child. Mama. What happened? Roshni! What happened? What happened mama? Would you like to have an apple? What happened? Come. Come. Look what I have brought, cage. Shivani will like it very much. What has happened to Shivani? Nothing. What has happened to Shivani? Why will anything happen to her? I was saying that I have brought a cage for Shivani. I will go and give it to her, she will like it very much. Shivani! Shivani, look what I have brought for you. Cage, why? The birds that you liked so much, take them along. By separating them from their mother, no! No! No matter. By the way Shivani, when are you going? - Where? Won't you go back to your home in Mumbai? No Bheem Singh uncle, now we will stay here. This is our home. No, no dear, you are selling this house. I wish I had won a lottery, then I would have bought this house. If I had bought this house... ...I would have completely changed it. Like, how would you have changed it? What do you mean by how? The yellow colour on the wall. I would have coloured it completely blue. Just like the sky. And the curtains, it wouldn't have been white. It would have been flowery like my shirt. I am telling the truth, dear. And after that I would roam around in the house proudly. With pride. Don't laugh. It would seem like a king is coming. O God! O God! O God! Bheem Singh! - Ghost! What happened? Ghost! Please forgive me. I will not buy any house here. I will clean the house properly too. What happened, Bheem Singh? Don't do anything to me. O God! Mama! Mama! - Shivani! Mama! - Shivani! Mama! Papa! Papa! Mama! Mama! Mama! Papa! Papa! Mama! Mama! Papa! Shivani! Mama! Shivani! That's it. Here comes aunt's house. Greetings sir, greetings madam. Sir didn't tell me you are coming. Where is Sudeep sir? Hey Sudeep, Roshni! You scared me on the phone. What happened, Roshni? - Nothing. Come in, I will tell you. Bheem Singh, bring the luggage. No sir, the bush shirt flowers... - Bheem Singh! Keep the luggage in the guest room! Come on. - Yes. What's the matter that you called us suddenly Hi Sam uncle. - Hello dear. My dear, my child how are you my child? I missed you dear. Where were you dear? I missed you so much! A magical chocolate for my little fairy. Thank you. - Showing magic to a magician. What did you say? - Nothing. There are flowers on your veil, you will understand everything. Bheem Singh. Yes. Leave him. My little girl, she has been crying all the way. Hello madam, she is your mother and not her. Sameer. She was just laughing. - What happened? Both of you have gone mad? Speak softly Sam, Shivani will hear it. Of course she will hear it. And she should, so that she knows... ...how corrupt her parents minds have become! Sam... - I know Sam it is not something to be believed! But... but... we have seen it with our own eyes. What have you seen? The swing disappeared in thin air. Then Shivani disappeared. And then they reappeared too. Wow! And then, that glass attacked! This is the most ridiculous thing I have heard. But Sam, about Gauri... I mean about the abortion... ...except for the 4 of us and that uncle... ...no one else knew about it. And Shivani didn't even know about it. Neena, even you have become superstitious listening to them. You really want me to believe... ...that the soul of a unborn child is troubling them. Sameer, I know it is difficult to believe in it. There is no explanation to such things. There is an explanation Roshni. And it is a very simple explanation. You come in this isolated place for vacation. Incidentally this is the place where Roshni conceived... ...and both of you took the decision of abortion. All the things that papa said, still echoes in your mind as guilt. And what happens is hallucination. Illusion! Delusion! There is no reasoning for it. What happened? Diya. Don't touch this, take this. If this would have happened with your child Sameer. Then you would have believed in it. Give me a break Sudeep. Please. Where is Diya? Diya. - Sudeep. Sudeep what happened? - Sudeep. Sudeep, listen to me. - Shivani! Sudeep! Shivani! Sudeep! Sudeep, what is all this nonsense. They are children, they must be playing. Shivani! Search her. What happened? Shivani. - Sudeep! Sudeep! - Shivani! - Diya! You look there Sameer. Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Diya. Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! - Diya! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Where is my child? Shivani! Diya. Shivani! Shivani! Diya. Bheem Singh. - Yes. Did you see Shivani? Yes, I just saw her. She was taking sir's daughter in her arms. She was looking very happy. - Which way did she go? At the back. - What happened? What happened? Come on. Shivani! O God! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Diya! Sudeep carefully! Sudeep carefully! What happened papa? I was just showing Diya the waterfall. Take a look. I cannot understand, how this can be possible. If we had delayed another minute, then my child. Nothing would have happened to Diya, Sam. I got the stupid. Roshni, I cannot understand how you can say... ...nothing would have happened to Diya. You didn't see the way Shivani held Diya... Not Shivani, Gauri. And Gauri doesn't have anything to do Diya. She only wants Shivani. Sudeep, I think we should leave from here. Gauri won't let us go. Even if we leave, we will have to leave Shivani here. And I will not leave Shivani. All the time Gauri gives us, I will stay close to Shivani. Papa. What happened papa? Why are you looking at me like that? Tell me what is it? Mama, why aren't you talking to me? Mama, I wish to hear a lullaby. Papa, tell mama to sing it. Mama, sing it. Mama, sing a lullaby. Mama, sing it. Mama, please. "It's come." "It's come." "It's come." "When you came in my world." "My small and sweet doll." "I will keep you safe and sound." "So no one casts a..." You asked to sing a lullaby, because Gauri asked you. Isn't it? - Gauri! Who Gauri? Papa. - Papa, you! Bless you. - I had called him. Where is Shivani? - Inside. How is my dear child? - Grandpa! When did you arrive, grandpa? Dear, I was just passing by. I thought my child must be thinking about me... ...and so I came here. We had come here for vacations. But I fell ill so... Now grandpa has come here, you will be fine soon. But first give a nice hug to your grandpa. I missed you grandpa. I missed you too dear. You will leave me again, won't you? No dear, when you love someone... ...you never leave him, but come closer. I love you grandpa. - I love you too dear. Papa, what will happen now? What if Gauri... Shivani... I can understand your fear. I don't understand, when she was not born, then how... Abhimanyu learnt the art of war in the womb. I don't say it, it's written in the scriptures. The one you killed was Gauri's body. Not her soul. But papa... - Son, I know. I very well know the one I hugged inside was not Shivani. It was Gauri. Gauri will surely take her revenge. Shivani is paying for your mistakes. I will pray to God, that you don't lose your other child. Every child in the womb waits for his future. You killed her hopes. It might be our need to kill someone like this. But when the time comes to be punished. We cry and sob. We beg for mercy. You do that too. By adding your regret in your tears. If you can save your Shivani... then do it. We have made such a mistake... ...which we cannot mend now even if we want to. But we... You are listening to us, aren't you? Gauri! You are listening to us, aren't you dear? We have realised our mistake dear. But what can we do. Even if we want to, we cannot bring you in our world. You can punish us in whatever way you want... ...it is our mistake, but what has Shivani done. Tell me. Spare our Shivani! Please! What do you want, dear? Mother, isn't it? Then kill me too. Take me along with you, dear. We will live together. I will give you a lot of love in your world. A lot. I will always keep you close to me. Always. But... dear... please... spare Shivani. Please don't do anything to my Shivani, dear. Spare my Shivani! Spare my Shivani! Shivani... Shivani! - Shivani! Shivani! - Sudeep, Shivani! Sudeep, what happened? - Shivani. Sudeep! Shivani was right here and... - Shivani disappeared! How can she just disappear? What? What is this? Come on Roshni! Sudeep! - Sudeep! What happened, Sudeep? - Sudeep! What happened? Uncle, Shivani has disappeared! I will... - Sameer. Sudeep! Sudeep! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! - Shivani! Shivani, wait dear! Sudeep! Mama! - Papa! I am very scared! Shivani. - Mama! Papa! Papa! Papa! Mama! Papa! I am very scared! Shivani my child! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! Shivani! My baby. Papa! Mama! - Shivani! Gauri, don't do anything to my child. I beg of you, kill me but spare my child. Gauri, spare my child. But I am your child too. Or maybe not. Because I was not born. I was killed before being born. Mama, it is very important to be born... ...to receive mother's love, isn't it? You don't receive mother's love staying in the womb. Gauri my child. No mama, don't call me my child. Just like papa came here risking his life... ...to save Shivani, he wouldn't have come for me. Papa, you hate me isn't it? No, dear. You never wanted me to come to you. You want Shivani. Take her I won't do anything to her. I will never do what you did with me. In our world, there are many unwanted children like me. And in the dark night when the clouds thunder... ...and there is lightening we are very scared. The mama and papa that don't want us... ...we call out to those mama papa. Cry. Mama, in such a night when I feel scared... ...can I come to you in my house? Yes. You won't be able to see me, but I will hide in your arms. Yes dear. You will give me that much love, won't you? Please mama, please papa. Yes. "It's come." "It's come." "It's come." "When you came..." "... in my world." "My small and sweet doll." "I will keep you safe and sound." "I will keep you safe and sound." "So that no one curses an evil eye on you." "Let me hide you." "It's come." "It's come." "It's come." "It's come."
