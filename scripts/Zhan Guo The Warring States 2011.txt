Tacticians are needed urgently while Master Guiguzi was the most remarkable yet mysterious one at that time. According to legend, he had created a masterpiece on the art of war. Everyone was trying to obtain it so as to rule the world. It is said the essential ideas of the art of war was only passed down to one of his sttdents, Sun Bin... Mister Sun Bin lives in solitude, following the example of Master Guiguzi. The world is in the chaos caused by war. The Wei emperor is hoping... ...Mr. Sun could lend a helping hand. The Qin emperor is sincerely looking forward to Mr. Sun's assistance, we will offer a reward of a title of nobility. With great respect, the Qi emperor is now asking Mr. Sun... ...to provide help to us. It's gorgeous. The battlefield? No, I'm talking about Xi's eyes. Go! - To battle! - To battle! Go! To battle! Archer! Hide, everyone! Watch out for the arrows. They stopped. Let's go out and gather the arrows. Come on! Don't go out! There will be more arrows shooting at us. Hide! Hide from the arrows! I saved you; the flute saved me. I would die if it were not for it. To return the favor of saving me, I'll give you food. Food? We go to Wei's barracks to exchange the arrows for food. You can call me Doggie. What's your name? Sun Bin. Here we come. The General commanded that due to the tense situation, food will no longer be sent out while men be sent into exile. Well... We don't ask for food; the arrows are yotrs now. We're going to gather more arrows. Be right back. - How can you be so brutal? - Sun Bin. - They risked their lives gathering the arrows. - Sun Bin. Who's Sun Bin? You're the General? Master Guiguzi's student? They risked their lives gathering the arrows, just for some food. - You don't give them any? Fine... - Give him the food. I've got the food. Here, this is for you. Mister, save us. We're depending on you. Save us, please. I see, the General is a lady. She's pretty. Look at her eyes. It was she that beat you up? Wow, awkward. This is amusing. Have you come up with any ideas? Not yet. I'm sorry, I have absolutely no idea. What's the date today? I've got an idea. General, the Wei forces have cleaned up the battlefield. They even took the remains of our soldiers up to the mountain. What were they thinking? - What's happening? - What is it? What's wrong? Why is it becoming darker and darker? What's happening? What is it? Why is it getting dark? Hey, what happened? There will be an eclipse of the sun tomorrow, at noon. You shall seize the opportunity, lead your army down the mountain; sneak up on your enemy, give them a surprise attack. They will panic for sure, that's when you do a full-on strike. Be prepared... for war. General... General, the Wei forces went down the mountain when it got dark. Now they're approaching us from behind. Swap places and get ready! Yes, Ma'am. Attention! Watch out for spies! Fight! The Wei soldiers have red ribbons around their wrists. Untie the ribbon! Ma'am... Take... care... Sun Bin, don't go. Freeze! - Freeze! - Sun Bin! Don't run away. I'll jump if you come any closer. - Sun Bin! - Sun Bin! Archer! - Mighty General Pang! - Mighty General Pang! I've done a surprise attack... ...during the solar eclipse. The Qi forces were defeated and... ...the bordertown was easily captured. Who's the plotter? I don't know... Please forgive me, General. Who made the plan? The General's talking to you! I'm giving you one more chance, tell me. He's my junior fellow apprentice, Sun Bin. Sun Bin? We got to find him... ...at all costs. Can't let Wei have him. He's the only hope to rescue Senior General Tian. Miss, you're injured. Sun Bin. Are you talking to me? You're... Your Highness... Is Tian Xi coming back? Yes, Your Majesty. They just arrived. There's one extra person, named... Speak out. Sun Bin, the Qi citizen. Strategist Sun... Open the palace gate; greet him with supreme etiquette. I, Tian Ji, am responsible for the defeat. It was such a shame. I'm willing to be punished. I shall be sentenced to death. General Tian, don't say that, please. It's not the time yet. Mr. Sun, you're sent to Penglai by Buddha, it is our great honor to have you here. The Qi emperor is waiting for you... ...to get off the carriage. What happened to your face? I encountered a strange beast... ...which intends to carry me off. I fought back violently, the beast ran away with tears and fear. That's why I look like this. This way. Your Majesty, I'd like to know the name of that female General. Release Senior General Tian. Long live the emperor! All sages... ...have come to Qi. Qi is blessed. Buddha bless Qi! Buddha bless Qi! Pang Juan and Sun Bin are students of Master Guiguzi, yet only one of them has learned the profound ideas of him. Yes. How's your brother? Is he good, comparing to Sun Bin? My brother used to talk about... ...the time when they were with Master Guiguzi. Master Guiguzi asked them... ...to play hide-and-seek... ...when they were studying there. Sun Bin hid in the woods. My brother couldn't find him, so he played dead. Sun Bin came out immediately... ...that my brother thought he was a decent man, so they became best friends. Why doesn't Mr. Sun come to Wei? They say that Pang Juan promised Sun Bin to... ...let you marry him. Your Highness, I'm not going anywhere. Never mind. I was kidding. - Senior General... - Senior General... Father, sorry for my being late. You're more a reliable son than a favored daughter. You saved me. Father, you've lost the bordertown... I am ashamed of myself. How could the enemy defeat you so easily? It's classified. Where's Sun Bin? He's in the palace. Send my gratitude to him. Senior General... I raised a daughter yet she took responsibilities of a man. - Yes. - That's true. Should Tian Ji be punished for... Iosing the bordertown? What's your opinion, Mr. Sun? If he's found guilty, then you're guilty too. - How dare you! - How dare you say that! Speak out, please. You've given General Tian a job which is ill-suited for him. Your Majesty, Sun Bin shall be sentenced to death due to disrespectful behavior. - Agreed. - Agreed. Why? I'm gonna make you... ...the Defence Secretary of our nation. I feel honored, Your Majesty. But I can't accept that. Why not? Master Guiguzi doesn't allow me to be a politician. Well, join the army then? That's not allowed, either. Pang Juan is a General, remember? Sure. You idiot! You shall be killed for disobeying the emperor's order. No, no... I didn't... You want to be neither politician nor armyman. How about a hanger-on of the Tians? Who? Thank you, Your Majesty. - He's a fool. - No one rejects that offer. - Why are you following me? - What is he thinking about? I'm the hanger-on of your family. General Tian would like to thank you. He doesn't have to. He should be punished for losing the bordertown. Thank you, sir. General Tian is my father, you know? I do like you, but your father deserves a harsh punishment, that's the fact. What're you talking about? Your father deserves a harsh punishment. You said you like... You're not a fair lady, but I like the way you are. You're hurting me. Tell the Ma'am I don't need... ...I don't need a bath. Why are you doing this to me? You didn't hear me? I'm clean and tidy, except for the dirt on my face. That's it. Ma'am considered you filthy. A bath is exactly what you need as long as you want to be the hanger-on. Help! Still find me likable? Sober yourself up in there! Wow, truly a breath-holder. Sun Bin? Keep me company, huh? Ma'am, your shoes. You forgot your shoes, Ma'am. Ma'am... ...your shoes. She's a maniac. Help! How can I help you, sir? Are you laughing at me? You're not compassionate at all, are you? The Ma'am hit a bare-handed man... ...with a bat. It's savage, way too savage. Stop mocking me. I've got nothing to talk to you. Please tell your Ma'am, she should convince others by reasoning with them... ...instead of beating them up. I'm not her enemy; I'm a guest, that means I need respect. By the way, she didn't hit me in the face, that's kind of decent. You hear me? That's all. It is said Master Guiguzi's ideas on the art of war... ...were passed down to Sun Bin. - Not Pang Juan. - Yeah. Pang Juan knows nothing about tactics. Your Majesty, there's no such thing as the art of war of Master Guiguzi. It's just a rumor. How do you know? I'd been studying for more than ten years; I'd always been on the battlefront. It is... ...the bravery that matters; it is... ...the intelligence that counts. In this case, I don't believe the art of war... ...ever existed. I'm going to attend the annual meeting which requires only emperors' presences. The Wei emperor is claimed ill, General Pang Juan is the replacement. In the meantime, your priority is getting close to Sun Bin. The whole nation is... ...looking forward to you. Salute. Sit down, please. It is appreciated... ...the four of you attend this annual meeting... ...on schedule. Except the Wei emperor... Your Majesty, our emperor is too sick to be here. Your nations are colonies of Zhou. As the Zhou emperor, I'm deeply worried about... ...the numerous lives... ...cost by the war between Qi and Wei. So the main issue here is about the bordertown of Qi. What happened to your nose? The horse Tee kicked me on the nose. Do you think walking the horse is... ...the reason I brought you to Qi? Hey, slow down. I'm afraid of darkness. Wait for me, please. I can't see anything. Ma'am, all forces could be dismissed, but not this one, not the elite. You know him? He's the famous Sun Bin... ...who helped Wei to vanquish us. Don't hide yourself. Come on. Let them see your face. Nice to meet you. Han emperor, I'm gonna make you pay for the conflict last winter! Bring it on, then! Fine! You're equally treated here. You're equal... Knock it off! Knock it off! Horse racing it is. Let's see who's the winner! Junior General, please. We wish we could go with you to protect the emperor. You really wanna come with us? Of course, I'm apprehensive of... ...emperor being abroad. If so, please come with us. - Come on, come on. - No, no, no. How dare I go there... ...without emperor's command. You're such a hypocrite. We've already wasted half a day. Let's set out now. Eh... We have to go. You could go back now. Ma'am, the horse Tee is ingratiating you. How can you tell? I'm a horse whisperer. You're a line-shooter. Tee will bray on my command, believe it or not? Of course not. What if it's true? Whatever. Can I kiss you on the eyes... ...if what I said is true? Ok. Keep your words, let me kiss you on the eyes. Come on, just a kiss on your eyes. You were sent to Wei... ...as a spy for Qi. I was anxious... ...when Wei occupied our bordertown. Trust me, Your Majesty. Qi is safe from Wei... ...as long as I am on the battlefield. It's time for you to fulfill your promise. We've made a deal. Now I am the winner, you have to let me kiss you on the eyes. So... it's a yes? You replace the bat with a knife... ...to scare me off instead of beating me up. I can't help but wonder whether you have a crush on me. Someone? I... It's... Never mind. I said never mind! Ma'am! Drink the ginger juice. It's good for you if you catch a cold. Juan... Glad that I meet you here. Ma'am, this is my senior fellow apprentice, Pang Juan. This is Tian Xi. Juan, you're a devotee of liquor since you were a boy. You haven't changed at all! Help me, brother. Help you what? Give us a little private time. Got it. Tell her we're gonna play hide-and-seek... ...to see who finds you first. And? Make your appearance, come into her view. I will be gone by then. Brilliant, brilliant! Ma'am, I bet you can't find me... ...if I hide in the woods. It's been a while, Tee. It's been five years. Five years. Every single night, I look toward the direction of Qi... ...hoping you could ever show up. You don't talk much now. How's your sister? She's the empress now. Fields have eyes, and woods have ears. I used to sit alone like this... ...when I was a kid. You're right, we can't find you. Ma'am, would you like to know the first impression... ...you gave me? Not interested. The horse racing is a blind. Tee got to be the winner; the victory belongs to us. However, we have to be the loser this time. Wei will not return the bordertown, so why do we care about the horse racing? Pang Juan has turned against us. We cannot win this game. The winner is Wei! Ma'am, Tee was poisoned to death... ...before the race. Sun Bin insisted on riding another horse to race... ...as he saw Tee die. Round Two! You can't go. Tee's already dead, there's no hope at all. Don't be so negative just yet. Using our third-class horse vs. Their first-class horse, defeat; our first-class horse vs. Their second-class horse, victory; our second-class horse vs. Their third-class horse, another victory. I know about the horses we fed. The best they can do is to end in a tie. Hey, I'm here. I'm the horse whisperer. The winner is Qi! It's not about the victory. Leave this alone. Horse of Qi, on stage now! Wei people is waiting for me. You poisoned Tee, didn't you? Round Three! Go! Killing our horse doesn't make you win! The winner is Qi! - Awesome! - Awesome! No, no, sir... Sun Bin? You are capable of almost everything, even forecasting the solar eclipse. Why are you unable to protect yourself? Listen, that's nothing, not a big deal. I've been taught astronomy by Guiguzi, just skin-deep. I took a shot, that's it. Brother. What's up, Bin? Are you alright? No, not really. What do you mean by that? You asked me? You don't care if I was injured, do you? Of course I care about you. Come to Wei with me. Where're you taking him? Hey! Don't go. No, no, no, Ma'am. - Put your sword back. - Qi emperor is here. The Wei emperor ordered me to take Sun Bin back. What if we don't let him go? We'll attack immediately, right to the capital of Qi. What about the bordertown? That's small stuff. You can have it back once you give Sun away. Okay. Let's go, Bin. No, I'll wait for Tian Xi. Come on. Come on, let's go, Bin. If she really wants to see you off, she should have been here. She said she would come. Ma'am... Time to set off. Brother, time to go! Every single night, I look toward the direction of Qi... Pang Juan has turned against us... Five years... The flute saved me, I want you to have it... Do you know what's the most beautiful thing... ...that I've ever seen in this world? What? Your eyes. Here you are, the famous Sun Bin. So, Master Guiguzi... ...passed down his essential ideas to you? Bin is much more talented than me. This is? This is the place where I dig into the art of war. I feel calm in this room. - It's nice. - No one ever came here. Just us two. No one else. Bin, come here. Write down everything Master Guiguzi had taught you. What for? I wanna read it. - Cheers! - Cheers! Mr. Sun, I've got a question for you, we've seized the bordertown of Qi, why not follow it up to the capital? You won't achieve it. - Why not? - Why not? The bordertown you captured... ...is of no use. How can it be? The more military forces are required, the more troops battle for, the less important the place is. - Why is that? - I don't get it. - Why? - Can't get it. Sir, would you... ...fight for the bordertown? I wouldn't. Why not? If there're no more wars, no more conflicts, no more soldiers sent to the battlefront, will you be here? - No. - Of course not. Have you ever thought about going home and having a peace and quiet life? - Yeah. - Sure. I've got the news... ...before you got back, the emperor wants Sun's tactics and then gets rid of him. Sun's in no danger now 'cause I am here. Haven't you heard about that? The more information you get, the more risks you take. What you did is already a big risk. Is settling down here... ...your real intention when you came to Wei? Don't think of me as an idiot who knows nothing. When the Qi emperor gave me to Wei, I knew it was a trap. We must be fully prepared when it comes to tactics. No matter how small or unimportant the city is, we get the chance of triumph. That's because we are set. We have minimum amount of people with maximum of capacity. 'Cause we're fight a just war. No nation is invincible... ...if there's no sense ofjustice. Trustworthy and democratic nations last... ...while those using too much armed forces for aggression are doom to be destroyed. Sun Bin! Wake up! Get to work, immediately. The emperor is waiting. I... I've got it done. Are you my buddy or not? I certainly am. Then write it down, the tactics! It's capital crime to deceive the emperor with false information. Neither of us can take it. It's not false, okay? I'm gonna explain to the emperor. - Mr. Sun. - Mr. Sun. Your Majesty, I saw two vultures... ...fighting for food in the sky when I was hunting. I shot at them with a thought that... ...they were acting exactly like Sun Bin and Pang Juan. Sir, please come with us. Please. Come with us. - Where're we going? - Come on, just go. Just follow us. - Where am I going? - Come on, sir. Hurry up. Sir, please. No, no. Tell me what's this all about. We're sending you back to Qi. Why? Go, right now! Get on the carriage. Someone's trying to kill you, you know? If you don't run away, you will definitely get killed. I won't get killed; no one's gonna kill me. Fathead! Take him away. Please make them stop. I can't leave. Please... - Pang Juan! Pang Juan! - Get inside, sir. Hey, bro. - General. - General. What do you think you're doing, Wan? Sending him away, to Qi. Well then, could you tell me... ...what is the problem if Sun stays? What're you doing here with Wan? You know, just... hanging out. Bin, you lied. Sun Bin turns out to be a traitor. Should he be sentenced to death? Pang, when have you become... ...so irresolute? Your Highness, the whole world will regard us as genius-murderers... ...if we kill Sun. In that case, no gifted man will ever come to us. What's your opinion? We don't have to make him dead; make him a prisoner. He will eventually give in and give us what we want. Brilliant idea! Can we come up with a way of avoiding his escape? Traitors shall be punished severely. How about cutting his kneecaps off? That's it. Tomorrow... ...I'll send you back to Qi. Really? I've been longing to go back there, this place is boring. 'Cause she's not here, right? Tian Xi? Yes, I miss her, I really do. I'll miss you too if we part. Don't worry, I'll visit you. Why is the Wei emperor suspicious of me? Never mind. I told them... ...Master didn't pass anything down to you, right? No, no. What I wrote is what he taught me. I've learned the crap you wrote! Yes, that's it. Brother, I don't care if the Wei emperor believes me; but you... What? What is it? Hey! Are you angry with me? Sun Bin. Sun Bin, you trade our deployment information... ...with Qi for money. You're accused of treason. According to the emperor's order, you shall be put into prison instantly. Your kneecaps will be cut off. Bin, do you consider... ...those fatuous monarchs... ...as greedy villains? Only when they get killed... ...will the world be peaceful... ...and people content. Can you achieve it? If you can do it, I'm willing to be your assistant. No, I can't. Can you assist me, then? Recite the things you've learned, the art of war. Bro, don't leave me alone. I'm terrified. Juan, stay with me! Juan, come back! Don't panic. It only takes a moment. Go and seek help from Tian Xi. Yes, Ma'am. General, one knee is done. Did he recite anything? We gagged him. Why are you laughing? Why? No, no, no... Bin... Bin, it's okay, it's alright. Tell us about the art of war, tell us the real version. No way. Why? No way... Juan, kill me, please. Cut the other kneecap off. Yes, sir. Kill me... Please kill me. We'll drift into a war with Wei... ...if we rescue Sun. There will be a war sooner or later. Only Sun is comparable with Pang. Your Majesty... A reward of one hundred taels of gold and a promotion... ...will be given for being Sun Bin's body double. I heard Sun's kneecaps had been cut off. Do you want to go and see him? No, I'm staying here, serving you. You should go there... ...just for fun. I don't have to do that. Escort Ma'am to see Sun Bin. Yes, Your Highness. Please, Ma'am. You got to find a way out. Ma'am! Ma'am! Sun's gone crazy. Somebody help here! General, here. He's lost the ability to walk. Giving him the key doesn't help at all. Write down the tactics. No more trick. You're talking to me? What? - Go! - Go! Halt! It took you three days... ...to give me this crap? What were you thinking about? What were you doing? General, it seems true that Sun's mad. Screw you! Take him to the street. Yes, sir. Move. Screw you! Screw you! How long has it been since my departure? You were a thirteen-year-old girl when they sent you to Wei, it's been ten years. Is there... ...anything I can do for you? Sun's already gone crazy. There's no need to imprison him. There's people guarding him. If you're going to rescue him, we have to collaborate. Okay. - What is it? - It's stinky. Why so stinky? - What's with the smell? - It's gross. Who's this lunatic? Filthy bastard! Gross. After all these years, we finally have the chance to get together again. Let's get good and drunk. Good and drunk it is. General... ...please. Sister, do you remember our favorite dance? I've forgotten the moves. Can you show me again? Sis... You smell that? Yeah, gross. Stay away from him. Come on, let's go. Listen, Sun crawls to the crossroad and stays under the tree every day. The path is narrow, which is good for covering him. You can use carriages running on the street as a distraction, but everything has to be done very quickly. Keep that in mind. - Mr. Sun. - Get on the carriage. Mr. Sun, come on. Come on, let's go. Sun, let's go. Come on! Don't let Sun get away. Come on! Please, come with us! Hey! Get out of the way! - The guards! - Mr. Sun. Come on! Sun Bin! Hurry up! Why didn't you go? I don't want to leave you. Assassin! I don't wanna leave you, either. Assassin, huh? Let's go. I don't get it. Ma'am, is Mr. Sun really mad now? Breaking in is the only way out. Hey, who are you guys? We're hay-deliverers. You came early. Sun Bin. - Sun Bin. - Mr. Sun. - Go! - Go! What do you want? Where's Sun? That's my question. He treats you as his family, his best friend. How could you do that? I've tried. He's half dead now. Why can't you release him? Let me take him. Please, I'm begging you. Last time, I deliberately let you get away. Why are you coming back? What do you want? The horse Tee is ingratiating you. I'm a horse whisperer. Where're you going? Back to Qi. You think you can get away this time? What do you mean by that? Want to cut my kneecaps off? I give you the chance to go, but, remember this is your last chance. Step aside. General, Sun has been taken away... ...through a blind pass in the barn. I won't let you get away. They're approaching us! Yu Zi, speed up! Get the gate open! Yes, Ma'am. Go! Go! Go! Hurry up! Guard! Go! Open the gate! Speed up! We're nearly on Qi's border line. Step aside. Pang Juan, look. That's Qi. Remember? I made my own choice. You won't get it. The emperor was right. You did turn against us. In this case... ...let me take you back! Go! Stop the carriage! General... Where am I? You're in Qi. Sun Bin. The General wonders... ...whether Sun's really crazy. General, look. - Sun Bin. - Sun Bin. Wei violated us; insulted us. Sun Bin fought for our country... ...but was caught and tortured... ...by Pang Juan. - The vicious Wei! - The vicious Wei! Taking Sun's life doesn't scare him off, not to mention cutting his knees off; he's fearless, he's a hero! - Sun Bin. - Sun Bin. - The vicious Wei! - The vicious Wei! - Sun Bin. - Sun Bin. The emperor... ...will go to the battlefront, leading thousands of warriors, with might and main! - Wipe Wei out! - Wipe Wei out! From now on, I'll keep you company. If you don't eat, neither do l; you don't rest, neither do I. I'll have nothing to eat... ...until you have meals. Earthquake! - Mr. Sun. - Mr. Sun. I know you've been suffering a lot, but look at them... The natural disaster has made the situation out of control. The emperor is worried... ...that Wei would invade our country. No, invading Zhao is their priority. Your Majesty, we can't involve ourselves in this! We can't get involved. It would be a catastrophe for us if we don't give aid to Zhao. Mr. Defence Secretary presented this. I'm told Wei is committing... ...all manners of crimes lately. Your Majesty, please send the army... ...to stop their evildoings... ...for the sake of the people all over the world. - Mr. Defence Secretary is here. - He's coming. Mr. Defence Secretary... Halt. Mr. Defence Secretary... I see myself in him. Here, for you. Thank you, Mr. Defence Secretary. Don't let him get any closer. Mr. Defence Secretary, we shall leave now. I see myself in him... - Assassin! - Assassin! There're many Wei people willing to die for their own country. Luckily you wore the armor today. I want to keep this, as a gift that you gave me. Where's the assassin? He poisoned himself. Is there any chance... ...strangers can get into town since I submitted my proposal? The gates were closed and guarded carefully... ...for these days... ...in case victims make any trouble. There's no chance for strangers to come inside. Just... Just the victims. The victims outside of the town are in horrible condition. We agreed to allow some of them to get into town the other day. How many people? Hundreds of them. Well... They must have sneaked into town at the time. There's nothing to worry about. They are gathered by the entrance gate. I'm gonna get rid of them. General, don't do that. I'd like to share my ideas with you. Tomorrow, we go there with the emperor to give out food to the victims. What? Why? Man can be fooled by everything, but not food. The Wei assassins must have had great meals... ...before they arrived. They're not like the victims suffering from hunger. We make the food extremely spicy, the victims wouldn't mind because they're starving... ...while the assassins would be picky and refuse to eat that. The truth will come to obvious. Food, food! Ma'am, listen, those who swallow the food are assassins actually. It is hard to... ...eat anything that spicy. Those who can eat must have been informed. We can find out the assassins... ...as well as the spy... ...who lets out the news. What the hell? Theirs are fine? The three of them, they're fine. This is awful. Why is it so spicy? Arrest them! Don't be caught alive! Where's the assassin? He poisoned himself. I've been looking for you. What're you doing here? I'm having a chat with Tee. Did you find out the spy? Let's go. Eh... What was I about to say just now? Ah... I can't accompany you tomorrow, so I came now, just to see you. I know. You're going to become the empress. Yeah. That's true. Are you sure about all these, the war and Pang Juan? I don't know. You're such an idiot. Come on. Put it on. No, Ma'am. No, I can't. I can't. Put it on! It will... ...protect you from any danger. You have to learn to take care of yourself... ...'cause I won't be around anymore. It is war. It's fierce, it's brutal. I want you to return home safe and sound. I'll wait for you. No, I can't wait for you. I am... I am... ...the empress now. Bin, would you treat me the same as always? Xi, things are different now. Is that what you want? I'm willing to go to the battlefield... ...to fight against Pang Juan. I'm going to vanquish him; I'm going to vanquish Wei. I'll fight for the people of Qi. Mister, go for it. I'll give you a significant gift... ...when you make the triumphant return. General... General, the Qi forces has started marching towards here. To aid Zhao? No, to seize our capital. Mr. Defence Secretary. What? We find Wei's troops. Senior General Tian suggests... ...we draw back yet leave three thousand warriors behind. Three thousand warriors? That's not enough. Mr. Defence Secretary, what do you think? Mr. Defence Secretary... Mr. Defence Secretary, Pang becomes suspicious. We've pinned down the Wei forces. Senior General, how long will it take to retreat? About Four hours. We don't have that much time. We got to pick up speed. Speed up! General, it's been two hours. Go figure. General, there's only one person. General? Follow up! Deliver this letter to Wei emperor as fast as you can. Yes, sir. Your Majesty, I'm disabled now. I intended to fight against Pang at full stretch, but I can't bear seeing the citizens suffer. If Qi and Wei accept a truce, common people can have their lives back. Just in case, I've set ambush in Maling Dao. I've made this decision... ...after thinking it through. That's a hoax. I've ordered troops to go to Maling Dao. I'm not buying it. Go back with me before it's too late. The emperor's not dependable. He's got other plans. You're risking your own life. I am the only leader. How could the emperor have other plans? He's trying to provoke me. Looking for trouble, huh? The victory belongs to me, only me. Brother, you've always been kindhearted, how could you become so indifferent to your soldiers? You want to see them die? You're out of your mind. Not me, them. The Wei emperor; the Qi emperor; Sun Bin; Tian Xi... ...and you. All these happened because of Sun Bin. I know exactly what you're thinking. I'd kill you... ...if you were not my sister. Wan! Come back with me. I'm begging you, come back, please. Senior General, Mr. Defence Secretary concerns about you. Please come with me. To where? Have a seat, please. Your daughter used this cave to secretly train her soldiers five years ago. It leads to Maling Dao. It seems... ...you knew it, right? You're saying? Come closer. Pang sent assassins to take my life, he had an informer in Qi. It's you, as expected. You know there's ambush in the cave, and you intentionally mislead Pang... ...to fall into the trap. You made a deal with the Wei emperor... ...that you get rid of Pang and then replace him, right? Does Xi know about this? Xi's becoming the empress; Qi is going to be much more well off than Wei once the war is over; the Qi emperor is a man of great talent and bold vision. Senior General, stay where you are, do what you use to do, but for your own country, Qi. Fire! Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - General is here. - Get out of the way. Wan, have you lost your mind? Brother, will this fire... ...pull you back to the man you used to be? No, it won't. The only way out for me... ...is to occupy Wei... ...and Qi, to gain the whole world! You're way too greedy. I can neither help you... ...nor stop you from doing this. I hope you won't regret it. I wish you a normal sweet life, if there's a future life for us. What're you gonna do? - Wan! - General! - General! - General! You can't go there! - General! - General! You can't go into the fire! - Wan! - General! - Back off! - General! Wan! Speed up. Go check. - Check! - Check! I feel anxious about... ...the battle tonight. Tian Xi, you deceived me. Your Majesty, I don't understand. You don't love me, you don't want to marry me. I know. I always knew. I promised Sun... ...to give him a lavish gift. No matter we win the battle or lose it, you two shall get married. General, we checked the pass. It's clear. Go! Halt! - Put out the fire! - Put out the fire! Bin, is that you? Juan, give it up, okay? Soldiers, thank you for standing right by me for so many years. I wished to lead you to triumph; I believed we could rule the world... ...and make your lives better. But see what I did now, I led you to the dead end. I'm incapable. You shall leave. Go home and accompany your family, have your lives back. Sun Bin is pure, honest and kind. He'll have you flipped. We shall surrender. You must take the order! Bin, it's over. Pang, you're a saint. Sun Bin? Victory! - Victory! - Victory! Get away, Pang! Run! Run! - To fight! - To fight! Sun Bin... Sun Bin, help me. It's gorgeous. What? The battlefield? No, I'm talking about Xi's eyes. You're a fool, you know that? Yes, I know. You're such an idiot. I know you've been suffering a lot, but look at them... I resent war. I like Tian Xi; I wish to marry her. Such a... such a fool. Bin... Bin! Sun Bin sacrificed himself for our country. We'll erect a monument for Qi people to cherish the memory of him. In the name of the emperor and the empress, I now announce that, for the world peace, you have to keep this in mind: There's no records of the art of war. Thou shall not spread any message related; thou shall not keep any book on tactics; thou shall not search for Master Guiguzi's students. Sun Bin's masterpiece, The Art of War, was unearthed in Shandong, 1972.
