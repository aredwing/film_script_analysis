Well, funny you should say that, Mel. Starting next week, I'm gonna have to put you on graveyard. You can still work mornings if you want to, but I'm gonna have to switch your shift over to graveyard. What? Where's Vivian? She does graveyard. She did graveyard. Vivian quit. Well, i can't do it. I'm gonna get robbed or raped or something. Why can't you do it? 'Cause I'm the assistant manager, and you're the cashier. Now, you want to go train to be an assistant manager, then you tell me what to do. Until then, I'll tell you what to do. We clear? Why'd she quit? I don't know. Called me on the phone. She said she didn't want to work here no more. Maybe she wants to be a drug dealer. Oh, yeah? Well, maybe I'd rather sell drugs than work the graveyard. Good lord. Hey, Kelly. You want your smokes? Yeah. Thanks, Mel. So, can I bring Richie? Suit yourself. Just don't let me see him behind the counter. Are you gonna let me have those extra shifts, or what? Yeah, if you can handle them, you can have them. Thanks. Thanks. What are you doing? What's wrong with you?! That's her family! So? She don't work here no more. Why should I have to look at 'em?

The lord works in mysterious ways. Amen. Is my baby gonna be okay? I can't really say. I'm the sonographer, not the doctor. I'm here to take a picture of the uterus, and when the doctor comes in, she'll interpret it for you. Oh. All right. Take a few deep breaths in and out for now. Is that it? Yes, ma'am. That's your baby. I can see it. Mm-hmm. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. Thank you. Not even a fucking phone call?! How stupid can you be? You know how much this shit is gonna cost us?!
