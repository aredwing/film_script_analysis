The tradition. - No! - I told you that. No! And it dies right here! Listen to me. What you're doing - It's all our family has ever known. - Gloria. Open your eyes! What were doing is an abomination And I'll have no part of it. Not anymore! May God forgive us. Son of a bitch. Out of my way boy. Only one thing that gonna stop me. You ain't got the balls to do it! Motherfucker. - Ben, get the phone. - Leave a message. It's the middle of the night. It could be an emergency. Hello? John, why are you calling here? Fine. But if she doesn't want to take your call, I'm gonna hang up. Dont fuckin call back OK? Babe, it's your father. He needs to talk to you. You want me to hang up? What do you want, John? What? My grandfather died before I was born. You're drunk. Stop screaming. Stop screaming at me. Hang up. What's going on, babe? Brielle? He said that I had a grandfather, who died today. - I thought your grandparents were dead. - Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm sorry, honey... I've told you my family was... Fucked up. You OK? You want to talk about it? If you change your mind. I'm here, OK? Hold on. I'm coming. - Who is it? - It's Brielle I don't have your money, OK? I'm still working on it. - We're not here for the money. - Feel free to get dress. Fuck you, Ben. - Fuck you, Sam - Not now, Ben. What you guys want? Could we come in? Oh my god. It smells like vodka and onions in here! What the fuck, you guys want? Did dad call you last night? Dad? Why the fuck would he call me? - So, he didnt? - No. Wait. Somebody called last night. But it was fuckin late, so I didn't answer it. Did he leave a message? If I had a fuckin answering machine, I'd probably would have. Can you say a sentence without using the word "fuck" in it? Fuck you! Guess not. This place looks really nice, Sam. Yeah? Feel free to clean up. - See anything you like? - Hell no! Dad called me last night. Yeah? Forgive me for not giving a fuck. He said we had a grandfather who had died yesterday. What? We don't have a grandfather. Yeah I know but... that's what they wanted us to think. Well, he's a fuckin drunk. - Can't believe anything he says. - This time it's true. What do you mean it's true? A messenger shows up this morning at my place and... - ... hand delivered this to me. - What is it? It's an invitation to visit the property our grandfather left us. Property? - It says he left us a motel. - Are you fuckin kidding me? - No. - Where? About 4 hours north of here. No shit! So, what do we do? First we go to the funeral this Thursday and... then we set this place up. We've make a good weekend out of it and... I guess you can decide what to do with the motel. Are you kidding? I'm gonna fuckin sell it. Yeah. And the first $2000 of your cut, comes to us. Eat shit, Ben. So. Are you in? Fuck yeah. But I'm not gonna be stuck with him. I go there tomorrow. By myself. Youre not going to the funeral? I don't have any fuckin desire to see our father. That's typical. Your classy, Sam. I mean he was only your grandfather. Hey. What make you so god damn self-righteous you fuckin'... construction worker. At least I'm not a bartender/ drug dealer/deal addict/ - ... dumb fuck monster. - Ben! Who's the fuck there? Pick another winner huh, Sam? Are you set to go? Here's a copy of the letter and... And that's... for the motel. See you there. Take care sis. Why didn't you tell us? I have my reason. How can you say that? Trust me on this. But trust me on this. I don't think so. I think you wanted to deprive us of a grandfather. Like you deprive us of everything else! He was bad man. I'm glad he's dead. And you should be too. Bad man? How can you say that? He'd already given us more that you will ever did! What do you mean? - He left us some land. Up north. A motel, but I'm sure you already know about that. - Do not go up there! Do you understand? - Don't touch me! Forget the land. I'm sure that's what you want. Well, you know what? It's ours now. Ours!. Brielle, I'm begging you. Do not go there. OK? You're pathetic. Kelly! What a dump! Which? something. It's occupied. It's occupied. Are you OK? What is it? I do not know. - Hey, B. - Guess again. What's up, Benny boy? - You ready to rock for the weekend? - Hell yeah. - Well, get over here. - I'm almost ready. Hey, you guys mind if I bring a friend? I don't want to be the fifth wheel. No. Of course. You know, Bill got his camper, so there's plenty of room. Awesome. - So, who's the lucky guy? - It's not a guy. It's my friend Tanya. Oh? Well, you know it's just me and Bill so... you guys will have to deal with a weekend of celibacy. Don't flatter yourself. Anyway. This is a business test for me. I'm hoping we can sell this place for alot of money so I never have to wait tables ever, ever again. I hear you. - Well alright, get over here. - I'm coming! It's open. - Hey. Sorry I'm late. Got no other close aren't we? Nobody else is here yet. Grumpy. - Good to see you, sweety. - Good to see you too, Benny boy. - What's up motel owner? - Not much motel owner. Whoa... that's Bill.

What are you going to do with the hotel? I do not know. I think we're gonna sell it. We all could use that amount of cash. Especially Sam. I hope your family never left you anything. They did... Bad taste in men. Hey Wild Bill. Is it cool if we smoke in your RV? Does a dog lick his own ball sack? Hey! Stop it. - Where are we, Ben? - Be there in about a half hour. I gotta get another beer.
