We could go back to my flat.|It's nice and cool up there. Only gets the sun|in the mornings. Sit on the bed. Watch a video. What do you think, eh? What's up? Have I said something? No. Rachel,|when you got a moment... you couldn't have a look|in Bertha's room? She did a bit of number twos|on the carpet again. I cleaned most of it up.|Just needs a bit of a mop. All right? You're on your own, ain't you? So? You know the center of London,|the West End? Yeah. You have been there? Oh, yeah. Ah, bon. It will be much traffic? You might be lucky.|Have you got an appointment?

I walked through here|when I was a boy once... south to north. Me and my best mate. My face turned completely black. But he was already black. How do you get on|with the what's-it... the Channel Tunnel? I do not want to talk|about the Channel Tunnel... or any tunnel. Anyway, with the train|it is completement different. You see nothing. This conversation|is very boring for me. Fair enough. You are married? Yeah. With children? Yeah, I got two.|A girl and a boy. Oh, mais c'est formidable. All right? Fat boy! You want your ball?|- Just give it... Fucking give it back!|- Here you are. Go on, Gareth, spank him. Let's have him.|You want it, do you? Fuck! Get your ball back, mate.|- Fuck off!

Nah, he don't do nothin'.|- Comment cela? Beg your pardon?|- How he don't do nothing? He does a lot of nothing. Mind you, if eating|was an Olympic event... he'd be|the world champion by now.

Fuck! Get out of the fucking way! Come on! Ambulance. Fuck's sake. Alors, I am there|in the brasserie. I am very happy.|I am dressed very nice. I am thinking it is good. I will make the twenty-five,|the birthday with my son. It will be good. We will make|the good relationship. I am ashamed. Half past nine|he arrive with two girls... with red plastic dresses|like this. He say, 'Maman,|I have already eat. 'We go now to the casino?'|I say, ''No, Nicolas, no. 'Ca suffit. C'est finit.' Shame. We are nearly there.|- About five minutes. What did your husband say?|- My husband? He don't say nothing.|He is in Algeria. We are divorced. Is he still breathing? Yes!

Do you love your wife? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's funny, isn't it? What's-her-name, love. It's like a dripping tap. Bucket's either half full... or it's half empty. If you're not together,|you're alone.

Don't know what I'm doing.|I can't think straight. Rory, we're gonna sit you up. After three.|One, two, three, up. Let's have a deep breath,|please, Rory. Good, and another one. Excellent.|- Lie back. Wicked. And another. Magic, and one more. Sweet as a nut.|Normal breathing now. So you're not quite|sure if you're a smoker? It's all right.|I won't tell your mum. What did you have for breakfast|this morning, Rory? Fried egg sandwich. Fried egg sandwich.|Very tasty. You can have a heart attack|without knowing about it. Can you?|- You just don't feel well. Christ, there are|some arseholes on the road. Fuck! Dickhead!|You fucking dickhead! I didn't see you, mate. What the fuck were you doing? Oh, for fuck's sake. I didn't see you|coming round the van. You didn't fucking look, did ya? You all right, Rory? Want another drink?|- Yeah. Not too quick. Rory! Rory! What's happened to you, Rory? What's this? Look at him. He's got tubes|coming out of him all over. What are you doing here, Maureen? I come with him|in the ambulance. Oh, did you? What happened, Rory? I couldn't breathe. He had pains in the chest. Oh, don't worry. I'll look after you. This is my little baby boy. Where's Dad? Yeah, he'll be here in a bit. She was pissed as a fart. Good job Samantha was in.|- Yeah. Thanks anyway, Maureen.|- That's all right. I'm starving. I was just gonna make meself|a bit of cheese on toast. Are you hungry? No. When's your Phil and Rachel|coming up? Rachel ain't at home. She's probably gone up the market. I'll give her another ring|in a minute. My Donna ain't in, either. I can't get hold of Phil. Why? Where is he? Don't know. Mum? Rach. I'm just trying|to get hold of your dad. I don't know|what's happened to him. D'you get the bus all right?|- Yeah. He's in here. Sorry. After you. There you go. It's his sister. Hi. Rory... RacheI's come to see you. Rory's mum?|- Yeah. Hi, I'm Simon Griffiths.|I'm the doctor. I examined Rory before tea.|And I bet you're Rory's sister. Yeah. Hi. Hello, Rory. So, why don't we have|a sit down... and we can have|a bit of a chat, OK? Make yourselves at home.|Get comfy. Is he gonna be all right?|- He'll be fine. We've run some tests, X-ray,|checked his blood... Ain't he had a heart attack?|- Well, yes and no. What do you mean? He's had a kind of heart attack. In your heart,|you've got four chambers... divided by a big wall|of muscle, OK? And Rory's got a problem|with this muscle. He ain't never had nothing|like that before. That's the thing, you see. He's probably had it|since he was a baby... but it's only just|come to light. I can't believe all this. I know. We think|that's what must be wrong... but the consultant's got to have|a look at him tomorrow. What's going to happen? Good news is he should|be home within a week. But the thing|with this condition... is that it won't just go away... and we can't actually|cure it as such. Can't you?|- No. Afraid not. We're gonna have|to put Rory on medication. How long for? Probably for the rest|of his life. That don't seem right. Not to worry.|Lots of people take pills... every day of their lives and|they're none the worse for it. Rory will just pop in... see a cardiologist|every six months... and everything should be cool. He's through|the worst of it now. He's only little. He's been a good lad.|- Yeah, he is a good lad. Does he smoke? No. Yeah, he does a bit. Fuck off. Rory! Sorry, Doctor. Once Rory's decided|whether he smokes or not... he can give it up. The same goes for burgers and|chips and fry-ups and crisps. All that crap, eh, Rory? The sooner you get rid of them,|the better it'll be for you. Hello?|- Phil, it's me. Where the bloody hell|have you been? What's up? I've been trying|to get hold of you since 5:00. Your phone is off,|your radio's off. Neville can't get hold of you.|Nobody can get hold of you. What's going on?|Where are you? I'm on the A2. Rory's had a heart attack. Phil! What? We're up at the hospital.|South London General. What do you mean,|'heart attack'? What do you mean,|'What do I mean, heart attack'? Is he all right?|- No, he ain't all right! He ain't dead, is he? Of course he ain't dead.|Where are you? I'm just coming up to|that big Chinese supermarket. The one on the roundabout|down by the... Phil, for fuck's sake! Just hurry up and get here! Pen? Hello? It's funny. I'm starving,|but I can't eat this. Got a bleedin' headache. -Do you want a bit?|-No. Ta. Is he gonna be all right?|- Yeah. He's in good hands. Hear that baby? Yeah. Look at you. Come here. Shift up. Are you scared? We'll be all right. Here...what if it's a boy? Forget about it. How can I forget about it? I'll fucking kill him. Yeah. You gonna phone the police, Dad? No.|- Why not? I'll do it in the morning.|- Do it now. No. I'll phone 'em.|- Leave it. Give us that bit of paper. Dad! What? That bloke's gonna get away|with it, isn't he? It's none of|your fucking business. You phone Penny yet? You ain't, have you? You don't give a shit, do you?|You're useless. You're both fucking useless.|I'm going out. What? Oh, God. Fucking hell,|what have you done? Why'd you do that? It's all right.|I love you and all. Don't love you, all right?|I don't even like you. You need to get that seen to. Need to go to hospital,|all right? It's not funny. It's not funny! Not... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Can I help you? That's my boy. Can you tell me|his name, please? Rory Bassett. OK, Mr. Bassett, in you go. Right. It's only two by a bedside. OK. Sorry. There's only allowed two|by the bed. I'll wait outside, then. Don't be stupid.|You've only just got here. No, it's all right. Get yourself a cup of tea. I'll just wait outside. All right?|- Yeah. He's asleep now.|- Is he? Has he had an operation?|- No. I got lost downstairs. Bloke said, 'Go upstairs...'. All right, Phil,|you're here now, ain't you? What happened? Well, he collapsed. Maureen was with him|when I come up here. He's got to take pills|for the rest of his life. You never know what's|going to happen, do you? It's wossername...fait accompli. He might win|the lottery tomorrow. It's kismet, isn't it? What are you talking about? Where have you been? Out and about, you know. Where? Been a long run, then... You're supposed to be|a taxi, Phil. What are you doing|with your radio switched off? And your mobile... what's|the point of having them... if we can't get hold of you|when we need you? I know what you mean.|- It's pathetic! Leave it out, Mum. Stop having a go at him. Rory... I ain't havin' a go at him. It's all right. You all right, Dad? All right, mate? You been in the wars, ain't you? D'you wanna go on holiday? What? We'll go away...|when he's better. Yeah? Four of us? Yeah? Disneyworld? What? It is past 10:00. I don't want to leave him. I know, but the night staff|will take good care of him. Rory, gotta go home now. Be back in the morning.|- All right. All right, mate. I love you, Rory. Gotta go home now. Is he asleep?|- Yeah, nearly. He'll be all right. Havin' a cup of tea?|- Yeah. Do you want one? No, I'll have hot chocolate. Do you want a beer?|- No. I wish I could have stayed|the night up there with him. Well, they'll have|drugged him up... knocked him out until morning.|Wouldn't they, Rach? Yeah. First thing, then,|run you up there. You don't have to do that.|- I won't hang about. I'll come in, say hello,|make sure he's all right... then get straight on the radio,|start work as soon as I can. He'll be surprised,|won't he? Neville. He's a bit... wossername...|unpredictable, isn't he? He might not have me. There's a lot of blokes|work mornings regular. I might pick up|some airport runs. If he says no,|I'll try somewhere else. I don't want to talk|about it now, Phil. No, I mean it.|I'm gonna do it. I'm determined to do it. Got to get started, get saving. Shouldn't take long.|I'll work seven days a week. Start early, finish late.|Do nights, weekends... Phil, Rory's in hospital. Yeah. Sorry. But I made him a promise,|and I'm gonna keep it. What promise? About going on holiday.|- Phil! They do these deals, don't they?|Disneyworld... these two nurses I picked up|was telling me about it. They do these all-in packages. Wossername--fly/drive.|Florida, innit? Phil, it ain't about|goin' on holiday. It's about gettin' by|week in, week out. It ain't a game! Just 'cause you suddenly got|some bee in your bonnet... about gettin' up in the mornings|and goin' to work... when you've been lying in bed for|years till God knows what time! And we're all supposed|to be grateful... because you decided to do|what normal people do. I get up in the mornings.|Rachel gets up in the mornings. You make me sick. Doctor was asking about you. About your heart and stuff.|Your family. If anyone in your family's|had a heart attack. There was your Uncle Dougie,|weren't there? Me Nan had one and all. Oh, yeah. Me mum's mum.|- Forgot about that. Me dad's oldest brother.|What's his name? In Australia...yeah. There you are, then. It's all on your side, innit?|Ain't none on mine. Are you going to work|in the morning, Rach? Don't have to.|You can phone in. Dunno. I ain't going. If you do...when you're done...|give us a bell on the mobile. Run you up to the hospital,|see your brother, yeah? You'll have it switched on?|Not like today. Your son's in the hospital|having a heart attack... and we can't get hold of you. They know where I am in an emergency|but we can't get hold of his dad nowhere. Where was you? What have you|been doing all day? I switched it off. I know you switched it off.|Why'd you switch it off? I'd had enough. You'd had enough?|Had enough of what? Working for five minutes,|so you switched it off? What can I switch off|when I've had enough? Had enough of getting up|every morning, going to work... doing the shopping,|coming home, cooking the tea... cleaning the house,|doing the ironing... making sure everyone's got|clean clothes on their back. What can I switch off|when I've had enough? Had enough of what, anyway? Everything. What everything? For God's sake, Phil. You don't love me|no more, do you? What? You don't love me. Phil, what are you talking about? What's that got to do with anything? It's got to do with everything. Rory has had a heart attack! You ain't loved me for years. You don't like me,|you don't respect me... you talk to me|like I'm a piece of shit. I don't! You do.|- I don't, Phil. I don't talk to you|like you're a piece of shit. You do, Pen. You don't know you're doin' it,|but you do. That's stupid! That ain't fair! Why are you saying|all this to me? It's wossername... unbearable. What's unbearable? You don't love me no more,|do you? Do you love me?|I've got to know. Well... If you don't love me no more,|I might as well go. Where you gonna go? I don't know. If I'm making you unhappy... you know what I mean? I ain't... I ain't got no skills. I don't earn enough money. I know I'm a disappointment|to you. I know I get on your nerves. It's like something's died. I feel like an old tree|that ain't got no water. When we first met... I couldn't believe it. A pretty girl like you going|with a fat bloke like me. People were lookin' at us... I felt like the bees knees. We ain't got much... but we got each other... and that's enough. But if you don't want me,|we ain't got nothing. We ain't a family. That's it. Sorry. I know it ain't very helpful... what with Rory and that. I couldn't hold it in. I don't talk to you|like that, Phil. That's what it feels like. Do you want a tissue?|I've got some. Yeah. Shirt's all wet. Rachel? What are you doing there? Rach? You do talk to him like that. Do I? Sometimes. Is she all right? Yeah. What did she say? She's just a bit upset,|that's all. Yeah. Do you want one of these? No, I'm all right, thanks. What? Strange, isn't it? What? Don't know. I feel cut off all the time. Sort of... lonely. Yeah. Me and all. Do you? I love you. You used to make me laugh. Yeah. Do you want to go to bed? Yeah. Busy day tomorrow. He must be up here. That's it.|- Oh, yeah. Yeah, there he is.|- There he is. That's nice.|By the window. You all right? There's no chairs. There's a couple over there. Oh, yeah. You all right there, Rach? Yeah, thanks. He looks better, don't he? Got a bit of color|in his cheeks. Yeah. How did they get you up here? I come up in a wheelchair. Did you?|- Yeah. Got you some bananas, mate. Cheers. Here, I got you|something and all. What is it?|- Open it. What is it, a towel? No, it's a dressing-gown. What do I need|a dressing-gown for? For when you go toilet and that. All right, stick it in there. What's this, slippers? Yeah.|- Cheers. They're moccasins, ain't they?|- Yeah, nice one. They'll sort you out. You had something to eat? Yeah, I had fish. Did you?|- No. In batter? No, with sauce on the top.|Like cheese. Cor blimey! Did you eat it?|- Yeah. They tie you down, did they? No, it was nice.|I had that, and mash... and, like,|green cauliflower stuff. Oh, yeah, broccoli. I don't know, but I ate it all. That's good.|- Blimey. You all right?|- Yeah. She ain't been back to work yet. I'm gonna go back tomorrow. Why ain't you been in?|- I ain't been sleeping. Why not? She's been worried. What about? About you. We all have. Shut up. I'm all right. You are now. You've got|a bit of fluff on you. Did an airport this morning. Yeah, 5:00! Bloody hell. Yeah. Took this family|to Gatwick. They was going to...|what's the name? Cyprus. This bloke, two little boys,|and an old woman. We was going along,|and the kids started giggling... and the littlest one says,|'Here, Dad, she's farted.' Here, don't make him laugh. Are you hurting? He's all right. Anyway, so he turns around,|he starts clumping him. 'Don't be rude about your grandma.' He was swearing in Greek and that. I had to open a window.|It was... no, it was... Had all sorts in that car. That's right, yeah. You all right, Rach? Yeah. You want to be careful, you. Got talking to anyone in here? No, I ain't. Only just got up here, ain't you? I ain't spoken to no one. Did you get your card|from your nan? Yeah, it's that one there. She was gonna send|one of her cakes up. B L I Z Z A R D
