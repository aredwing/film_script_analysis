Yeah, well, uh, any identification? Oh, yeah. Sure. Look, we're happy to come back tomorrow. No, no. It's all right. Come on. Come on. Call said your power was out. Oh, well, I got a generator for the essentials. You live here all by yourself. So you have any idea what the problem could be? [Accent becomes British] Actually, Mr. Graiman, I do. We cut your power. Come here. What do you want? Your hard drives. Or more specifically, the research on your hard drives. Fine. Take 'em and go. Wonderful. Oh, Il also need you to guide me through the, uh, encryptions and safeties... you've undoubtedly placed on your files. You can kill me. I won't give you a thing. Killing you won't help me. Ah! I will, however, drive to Stanford. Pick up your lovely daughter, bring her back here and hurt her... while you watch. I think homeboy's having a cardiac emergency. Breathe, Charles. Unbelievable. Well, that didn't go according to plan. Shut up. We'll take the drives then grab the cardinal. She can break his codes. You killed the vacuum cleaner. Fan out. Make sure there's no one left in this house. Why don't you shoot it? Boss, better get in here and check this out. Lower level southeast corner. [Static] Damn walkies. Go get him, will ya? I've never seen algorithms this complex. Dude, just go get him! That's my kind of ride. Go like this. Certainly didn't come from the dealership. Shut down the engine and get out of the car. Want to go after it? Go after what? Whoever was driving that car knows we were here. Might have seen our faces. If we're lucky, we have 24 hours before the police and FBI are all over us. Our job is to deliver Prometheus and now the girl. And that's exactly what we're gonna do. [driver exhales, astonished] [Knight Rider Theme playing] This footage was shot in our labs last year. As you can see, the molecular-sized nanobytes can break themselves down and reform into another shape of similar mass. And though this is a relatively simple example, there's no limit to the size and intricacy of the possibilities. It is the basis for this technology we will be studying during the semester. Its origins, its foundations, and its possible future applications. Yes? I was just wondering if you're gonna be working with your father on all this. No, we haven't worked together in some time. I heard he's working for the pentagon. I'm sorry. What's your name? Dustin Cary. Well, Dustin, if you can find him, you can ask him. Otherwise, this is my class, so try to stay on topic, okay? (man) Open up, Mikey. I know you're in there. Mike, we have a problem. Oh, hey. Sorry, amber. You put hand soap in the dishwasher again? Your investors are here. And their knocking doesn't sound like the hey, let's all grab a latte kind of knocking, Mike. Hi, Dylan. Oh, Sadie. Hi. Mike, what do you want to do? # yeah yeah # # yeah yeah # # just take us back to our youth # # a new solution to truth # # so when we started as friends # # don't give it all away # # yeah # # yeah yeah # # yeah # # how long has this been ringing? Forever. Rivai. How long ago? I'm on my way. I wasn't expecting breakfast, but I didn't think you'd run out. Sorry. Work emergency. Stay as long as you want. Swim, lay out, whatever. Just lock up when you leave, okay? Aren't you worried about leaving someone you just met alone in your house? Not really. See ya. Hello. (male voice) Hello, Sarah Graiman. I've been trying to contact you for the past several hours. Great. Who are you? I know your father... he has sent me to find you as it is probable men who wish you harm are following you as we speak. Look, if my father sent you, he would've given you a code word. He did. The code word is "knight." Where are you? I-I just entered the library. Good. Continue inside. If someone attempts to follow you in without proper identification, you will see it. Good idea. Yes, I know. That man didn't have an I.D. Okay, what the hell is going on? Who are you and how do you know all this? There's no time to explain. Meet me by... you're breaking up. Did you say the front entrance? Hello? Mike, what are you doin', man? This is not a good idea. They are not takin' the car, Dylan. Mike. What are you doing, Mike? Get the garage door. What, are you crazy? They're standing right there, man. You know we can see you. Don't do this. Get in the car. I know how your mind works. Get in the car. Get in the car! All right, I in the car. Need a lift? (male voice) Where are you? Outside the library. Campus policeman's here. Sarah, wait. Excuse me. Oh, thank god. Uh, someone's following me. He tailed me into the library. He didn't have his I.D. All right, miss. Just calm down. Sarah, are you there? Yes, I... I with the campus policeman right now. He could be one of them. What? The sooner we I.D. This guy, the better chance we have of catching him. Ask him a question campus security would know. Miss, can you hear me? Um, yeah, I, um, he started after me over by Wilson tower. And then I crossed through the gunther building. And, um, then I ended up in the library. Okay. I'll get my guys right on that. Uh, in the meantime, you better come with me. [British accent emerges] But there's no such thing as the gunther building or the Wilson towers, are there, Sarah? Clever girl. Just like your father. How do you know my father? 'Cause I watched him die. No, you're lying. There are only two people in this world who could decode your father's work. Help us, and Il let you live. Refuse... and Il reunite you with your father directly. I will never help you. I'm sorry to hear that. Sarah, get in. Stop shooting. Cardinal's headed your way. She's in the car from last night. Kitt: Hello, Sarah. I apologize for being so brusque on the phone and for my tardiness. What is this about? I am currently working to form a reasonable hypothesis to answer that question. But my father did send you. Correct. Is he dead? I cannot be certain of his condition or location at this time. The mansion's perimeter was breached by men with hostile intent. My program for that scenario was very specific. Who are these guys? Kitt: They are the same men who assaulted the Graiman home last night. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Your heart rate and breathing are higher than normal for a woman of your age, Sarah. Gee, you think? Did my dad give you a name? I am the knight industries three thousand. You may call me Kitt. All right, Kitt, so where are you taking me? I am going to the mountain roads, as they will provide the best environment in which to elude the car following us. The what? Don't suppose you know how to fix a thrown rod, do you? You think that's funny. No. I'm not that vain. But Dylan might. No, I don't. You should listen to your mechanic. Yeah, he's always saying that. We've got a problem here, Mike. Doesn't he ever talk? You have a busted car, which means no racing and no income. And you owe me $90... $87... $90,000. Fine. Whatever. Is this the part where you break my legs? What am I, stupid? You're an army ranger. Probably kick my ass. That's why I have him. Come on... Mike. You have until midnight to get me my money. Tonight? Come on, man. I'll get you your money. But you gotta be reasonable. Oh, oh, I have been. For a long time. And you know it. How am I supposed to come up with that? Have a bake sale. What do I care? And if I can't? Then Dylan disappears into the Nevada Desert. 24 hours after that, if I still do not have my money, you'll join him. There's an urban legend about a car Graiman built 25 years ago for Walton knight. Supposedly possessed the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created. I don't see how a thinking car is gonna help us. It's the next step in Prometheus. They're still back there. That is affirmative. Are you going to slow down? Negative. Oh, god. Whoa, what are you doing? Eluding our tail. What, are you crazy? I do not believe so. Wrong side. Wrong side. Oh, all right... by using GPS radar and real time satellite imagery, I have all the data necessary to safely navigate these roads. Great. Did my dad get a chance to, um, test this? Not extensively, no. Oh, god! Yeah, this isn't fun at all. Sarah, your fear is irrational and misplaced. Welcome to the world of being human. Stop pressing our luck. Welther will have them from the air any minute. Man, quit being such a bitch. That's good. Call me names. How much more of this do I have to take? Kitt: I could wait and time the next pass, but it may kill the men following us. Look, I a compassionate person. But so what? One of my primary directives is the preservation of human life. But your primary directive is the preservation of our lives, right? That is the ideal outcome. Then make the pass! Oh, god! God, I hate you. Ah! Kitt, I could kill you! The satellite imagery suggests they are unable to continue the pursuit. But there will be more of them. How soon can you get us off this road? We must continue on this route for 23.8 miles. Sarah: Kitt, a stop sign! There is another option, however. Kitt. That's incredible. And should provide adequate cover until we reach our destination. You mean until we reach home. Kitt, my father is missing. We're going home to find out what happened to him. And how will you accomplish that? I don't know yet. If those men continue to attack us, how will you defend yourself? I have you. Kitt: Advanced as I am, there are situations in which human help will be required. You're impossible. Because you're my father. I am not your father. Okay. So where have you been programmed to go? My mission after ensuring your safety is to enlist the help of Mike Traceur. My father programmed you to find Mike Traceur? Carrie Rivai, apple of my eye. Donny Leeds is jonesing to see you. On your day off no less. What's the crisis? This morning, our database intercepted a report that Charles Graiman is dead. Oh. No way. You don't even know who that is, do you? No idea. He was a civilian inventor working on Prometheus for the pentagon. Oh, the remote control thing. It's the remote system by which all our military drones are controlled and our smart bombs are guided. Yeah, the remote control thing. So why'd they call you? Because I knew him. No, it's way beyond research. Uh, look, Il... Il check in with you when we get a visual. Let me know what you find on Graiman's hard drives. Where the hell is this thing? Take it down. What? They gotta be down there somewhere. I said take it down. That car won't go anywhere without her. There's gotta be a better way of tracking them. Coroner's initial report cites a heart attack. We're not getting backup until there's evidence of foul play. So when do we leave? I'm leaving immediately. I need something else from you. Graiman had a daughter, Sarah. She teaches at Stanford. She hot? Sorry. She was basically his only connection to the outside world. Find her. Make sure she's okay. See if she's heard from him. Cool. Find the daughter. Ensure her safety. Got it. Consider it done. You can count on me. What is wrong with you? What, like how? My recall is 100% accurate. Do you not know Mike Traceur? I knew him. We grew up together. But you do not speak anymore. I left for Stanford and never heard from him again. That's strange. Why would he cut off all contact? Because he's immature and selfish. And why would your father send us to him? (Sarah) Because my father trusts him. How far out of our way do we have to go? I am not yet sure of that. You don't know where he lives? Is this the correct address? No. He hasn't lived there in years. In anticipation of that, I have devoted other resources to finding him. There are numerous images of Mr. Traceur in Las vegas over the last ten months and as recently as two days ago at an ATM. What? How do you know that? I scanned his face into my database, used profiler software to search through faces on the internet. As well as various feeds from public and private security cameras. That's not scary at all. And Nevada power bills a Mike Traceur living just outside of Las vegas. But that's 600 miles away. At maximum speed baring any unforeseen traffic anomalies, we can be there in 3 hours and 17 minutes. You're kidding. I do not kid. You are sad. Yes. Do you know what that is? I have a definition of the term. But you'll never feel it. No. But it is a fact that all beings must die, correct? And despite that knowledge, grief is inevitable? Yes. But sometimes it's not that a person dies, it's the circumstances. I'm not sure that I understand. My mother left my father a few years ago. She just had it with his eccentricities, paranoia, living in the middle of nowhere. He's a great father, but not much of a husband. You blamed your father for your parents' failed marriage. I told him that he'd driven her away. It was the worst thing I ever said to him. And I never had a chance to take it back. You are talking about regret. I have no recent data from Mrs. Graiman. She died. Last year. To have so many years as a family and it might all end like this just... sucks. That does "suck." Why did you bring this up? It is widely documented that verbally expressing the root of an emotion can help provide peace of mind. Is that research mistaken? No. It's not. # is this why you wanted me # # to watch as you walk away # I got a few thousand left. It's enough to try to make a play. So you'll, uh, make your play. And, uh, what if that doesn't work? Well, I feel like Ie spent my whole life running. This won't be any different. I really don't want to run, Mike. I mean, don't get me wrong. I really don't want to die either. Uh, but I really don't want to run. You know? Then wish me luck. Or get a gun and some ski masks. Oh, you found it. # you told me just about the other day # # what a sigh you give when you comin' my way, yeah # # I saw you, babe and you checkin' me too # # feel my love with a little bit of glue, yeah # # all right, that's what I talkin' about # # Kitt: Mike Traceur has just made a cash advance withdrawal on his credit card. Yeah, that's him. Take the earpiece. It's a communicator so we can keep in contact. It is always activated so I can always respond. Okay. Agent Rivai. Afternoon. Sheriff Ramsey. Afternoon. My men and me have been all through there. There's nothing to indicate foul play. So you won't mind if I have a look around. Not at all. Though I might ask you a favor in return. Graiman lived alone as far as we could tell. His wife passed away a while back. Couldn't find a number for his daughter or anyone who knew him really. You need a positive I.D. For the body. Well, I figure seeing as how you knew him. Fine. You know where to find me. All right. Bet... 2,000. All-in. Did you have it? You plan on playing like that all day? Keep playing like that and you won't make it through the day. Sarah. Hi, Mike. What are you doin' here? It's nice to see you too. No, I just meant how did you... look, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I need you to leave here and come with me right now. You gotta be kidding me. I'll explain everything on the way. What could you possibly say to explain that? My father's missing. Maybe dead. And this morning, men tried to abduct me. That's actually a pretty good start. What did the cops say? Dad wanted me to come to you for some reason. You didn't go to the cops? No. We're wasting time! I'll take a vodka rocks. I got her. Casino floor. Talkin' to some guy. Looks like they know each other. Let's try to I.D. The guy. Sarah, even if you are in trouble, I have problems of my own. What's that mean? It means I can't help you. Kitt: Sarah, the men who were following us earlier are now in the casino. By the bar, black coat. By the slot machines. Red sweater. Sarah, what is it? The men that tried to abduct me, they're here. By the bar, black coat. By the slots, red sweater. They couldn't have followed me. There's no way. They didn't have to. Is your cell phone on? Uh, yeah. Turn it off. Were you wearing that top this morning? Uh, what do you think? Hold this. I run, I leave someone out to dry. How much do you owe? $90,000 by midnight. And a poker game is your master plan? You got a better idea? I'm all ears. I'll pay it. Help me, and Il clear you. Where's your contact? Outside. The car. Here. Tell me if you recognize anyone else. Hey, you there? Yes, I here. How can you see them? I have accessed the casino's security cameras. Good. See their earpieces? Look for any other guys with the same ones. Come on. I believe there's another one headed towards you. He's one of them. Move. They're heading to the east entrance. They've seen us. They're looking for a way out. They have all the exits covered. Great. Which one is the smallest guy watching? If you're considering hand-to-hand combat, may I make another suggestion? Look, man, you're really startin' to piss me... off. Damn you. The best thing we had going was the crowd. Go to the security door on the east wall. Those doors have remote locks, genius. I'm aware of that. If you can't open this door, I swear, when I done with these guys, you're next. [Woman over intercom] Your attention, please... you're in way over your head, kid. Oh, you think so, huh? Oh! You're lucky that worked. Luck does not factor into it. No? Does sitting out in the car while Sarah gets ambushed factor into it? I'm not sure my entering the casino would be the most subtle approach. Where did you find this guy? In approximately ten yards, make a left turn. There will be an emergency exit. Il meet you there. I'm lookin' forward to it. What happened? Our job just got harder. Nice ride. What the hell is goin' on? Just get in. I thought you said your contact was in the car. No, I said my contact was the car. Hello, Mike. You may call me Kitt. Okay. It's talking and it knows my name. Do you mind telling me how this thing is driving by itself? It's not a thing. It's a car. And you may call it Kitt. Kitt? Great. Fine. Whatever. Kitt, you try somethin' alike that agn, Il put sugar in your gas tank. even think about it, Mike. Mike, don't antagonize the car. Kitt, just ignore him. You're doing great. Yes, I know. Do these guys know what this looks like? I wouldn't worry about that. Huh. Who knew it came in "cholo"? This is the body you have at the morgue? Yep. That's it. How many men do you have available? I don't know. Maybe 20. why? We're gonna need all of them. Charles Graiman is still alive. It's the power company. At this hour? Look, go to the passage door. No. Don't be an idiot now. All the security systems are down. Thank you, Ben. Don't thank me. It's my job. Go on. Go on. (Ramsey) So he's been using a body double. At first it was just for public appearances. But as the years went on and Charles work started getting more attention, he used Ben for everything. After awhile, people didn't know the difference. Seems like a crazy thing to do, you ask me. The dead body at the morgue makes me think the opposite. My backup's still hours away. Could sure use your help on this. I'll call in whatever help I can. (Mike) So you have no idea who's after you... what they want. Part of the footage I captured when I was leaving your home included this: I have traced the vehicle's registration to the black river corporation. What? What's black river? A private security firm. I spent time with some of their men on the ground in Iraq. They're just about the money. Huh. That sounds familiar. My analysis of the situation leads me to believe that black river is most likely after Charles' research in order to try to get control of Prometheus. Within seconds of breaking Charles' encryption, they would be capable of crashing planes, attacking foreign nations. The result of which would be chaos, certain death, and possible war. And he just had the program specs laying around on his hard drives? They would need Charles Graiman to decode the data. Or someone who knows what Charles knows. Yes, we collaborated on the initial encryption codes. But then we stopped speaking. I possess all of Charles Graiman's knowledge and can access Prometheus. Which is why after ensuring Sarah safety and Mike Traceur's help, Ie been programmed to go to the FBI and turn myself in. Kitt, stop the car. Now. That seemed quite irrational. You clearly don't know much about women. Kitt: On the contrary, my databases... Kitt, shut up. Sarah, where are you goin'? To get a rental car. Look, maybe the FBI can help us. The FBI will stick us in a room and ask questions for 12 hours. We have to get back to the house. Figure out what happened to dad. I've already wasted too much time coming out here. You would do the same thing for someone you loved. I cannot allow you to go on by yourself. Either you take me back home or I going by myself. In that case, I have no choice but to take you. You do realize that by going back to the house, you'll be doing exactly what they expect you to. You'll be taking Kitt right to the people who want it. I'm not running from this. Sarah, I have done plenty of fighting. Trust me. It doesn't make a difference. You can leave if you want. I will still pay your debt. Your choice. Welther. Secure. How is that possible? The FBI agent that's here confirmed it. The body isn't Charles Graiman. Thank you for your assistance. Let me know if anything else turns up. Well, it seems our dead Mr. Graiman is not Mr. Graiman after all. So what do you want to do? We continue back to the mansion as planned. Hey, I really am sorry about all this. Your dad was always good to me... to my mom. How is your mom? You still don't talk to her? If your only parent sent you away, you might not want to talk to them either. Mike... you weren't exactly a choir boy. She might not have had a choice. Everyone has a choice. Well, she's not gonna be around forever. So... might want to ask yourself what you'll regret when she's gone. Tell me you're winning. Actually, there was a change of plan. I had to leave. But don't worry. I'll get you the money soon. Yeah. How soon were you thinkin'? She missed her afternoon class, which is unlike her. She's also not answering her cell. I had the office try and triangulate the signal, but it's either off or dead. I left her messages. Email me the number. Agent Rivai. Carrie. Hello. Find anything? What do you see here? Nothing. Exactly. Same thing in the office. Somebody removed all the hard drives. No kidding. Move and Il kill you. Jenny, it's me. It's Charles. Charles. What the hell are you doin'? Listen. I need your phone or a computer. Charles, I haven't had a phone in ages. Certainly not a computer. You know me. Why would you even think that? I need to get to one. Is your car out back? Kitt, pull over. Is something wrong? What is it, Mike? What's the matter? Nothing. I gotta pee. Hey, Mike. Um, why'd you blow me off? I'm sorry, what? After I left for school. I called you. I wrote you. I practically stalked you. And, um, you never responded. Look, do we have to talk about this right now? Yeah. I want to know. I mean, I thought we had that great summer together. All year... we talked about how we couldn't wait to see each other. And then... you just disappeared. Sorry. Sorry? That's it? Look, I met someone at school. I didn't know how to tell you. You met someone? Yeah.. At military school? Yeah. I did. Right. So... are you guys still together or did she run away with G.I. Joe? You're hilarious. Hey. You could've told me, you know. Whatever it was, I would've understood. Great. Next time, you'll be the first to know. What are you doing? You want to drive? Kitt's not another trans am, is it? It's a mustang. Yeah? And who's driving it? No. No. No. Not him. You can't... I needed someone to watch over Sarah. He was the logical choice. Jenny. Kitt, back. Kitt, forward. I must make a stop. You know we did stop an hour ago. If you had to go, you should've gone then. I'm glad you're having fun with this. I require fuel. You run on gas. Not hydrogen or plutonium or somethin' really cool Ie never heard of? Yeah. And what if you're in Nebraska and your hydrogen fuel system breaks down? Complicated isn't always better. Why you gotta hate on Nebraska? My system is largely solar powered and recycles 91% of its expended energy, allowing a ratio of 167 miles travelled for every gallon of fuel burned. So the super car runs on gas. This is weird. What is weird? I don't know. Kinda like havin' a creepy guy in the backseat. You think I am a creepy guy. Forget it. Why did you leave Sarah Graiman? Oh, we are not talking about this. Sarah said you are immature and selfish, and that is why you left her. She said that? Do you have another girlfriend? Are you a homosexual? Oh, come on. Did you really just ask me that? Is it not natural that you should have a companion of some sort? Monogamy is not natural. Why do you say that? Because relationships don't last. It is true in the last 20 years 53% of marriages in the united states ended in divorce. Right. You happy? I cannot be happy. Yeah, me neither. Client's team was able to pull the specs for the car's computer off of Graiman's hard drives. What does that mean? It means that now it's just another computer. We'll need to get close. But if we can do that, I think we can hack into it. We need to find it first. No, we don't. We follow Charles. The car will come to us. Excuse me. You dropped a chip. Oh, come on. Really? You would not be pleased if I dropped food on you. Do unto others. From the book of Matthew 7:12. This is intolerable. All right, Il pick up the chip. I have received new coordinates as well as a phone call I will patch through. What? From who? It's from Charles Graiman. Sarah. Dad. Are you okay? Yes, I escaped through the passage. I went to Jennifer. Is she with you? Yes, she's here. Hello, Michael. Charles. Thanks for thinking of me. Where you now? We're at the park woods motel. Kitt is bringing you here. Are those men still after you? I think so. Well, thank god you're all right. Listen, has the FBI tried to reach you? I don't know. My phone's been off all night. Well, use Kitt to try and contact Carrie Rivai. Okay. Yeah. I remember meeting her at the house. Good. Tell her and only her where you are. I'll wait here for you. Okay. I love you. Love you too. I'll see you soon. Hey, Sarah Graiman. It's me, Kevin. Uh, I with the federal bureau of investigation's agency. And we are trying to get in touch with you so I need you to call me back, okay, whenever you can. Baby, it's me. I just got a call from an FBI agent who says you're missing. If you could call me, that'd be great. I hope you're okay. I took lucky out to p... who is that? That's Brock. He's kind of my boyfriend. You have a boyfriend? Named Brock? So does he own a long board or use "dude" as a verb? Sarah Graiman, this is special agent Carrie Rivai. It's extremely important you call me. Kitt, dial that number. Put the motel's address on the screen. Rivai. Sarah, thank god. Are you all right? Wait, wait. He's where? The park woods motel. Route 33. We're heading there now. I'm with the sheriff. He can send a car immediately and Il be there within the hour see you soon Park Wood's Motel on route 33. How far? That's on this road. Only 12 miles from here. ...checkin' in? Looking for a friend. Charles Graiman. Uh, yeah, he's here. Marvellous. Which room, please? That's kinda tough to say. Easier now? He checked into four different rooms. So I not exactly sure which one he's in. I... Ie got a lock on the car. It's... it's close. (Welther) Initiate the program. This ends now. Dylan got the money you transferred. I was able to pay them in time. Thank you. You're welcome. Kitt: A thermal imaging scan of the motel is picking up three heat sources moving amongst the buildings. What does that mean? That they're already here. Stay with Kitt. And don't worry. I'll bring him back. Kitt: Proceed to the office with caution. I can guide you to Charles Graiman's room. Would you prefer to avoid confrontation? Sure. Why not? What the hell? Oh, God. Baby, are you okay? Yeah, I fine. Except for the fact that my mother is shooting at me. - Where's Sarah? - Around in front We need to get to Kitt and get out of here now. I still can't believe you built another one. What do you mean "another one"? He needs to know. It's time. What do I need to know? Kitt: Mike. - Wait. The three heat sources are now approaching the room. We gotta move. How long till you're in? I'm already through the second firewall. Good. There was another Kitt? In another place. Long time ago. Well, what happened with it? After I finished the first Kitt, I was relocated here so nobody would ever know who had built it. Kitt: Pause to avoid visual contact. How do you fit in? We were moved here too, Mike, when you were a baby at your father's request. My... Kitt: The passage is clear My father left us. Yes, he left you. But it wasn't for a lack of caring. He had obligations that he couldn't abandon. Even for you. What does that even mean? Your father's name is Michael Knight. He was the man who drove the first Kitt. He'll get over it. FBI! Stop right there! Please stop yelling before you get us all killed. Agent Rivai, good of you to come. Hello, Charles. Friends of yours? Yeah. Is Sarah still with Kitt? This way. Hurry. We don't have much time. Did Ben make it out? No. They took your hard drives. How long before they break your encryption? It's difficult to say. Without the codes, it could be hours, days... We need to get you someplace safe. And I want you to tell me everything. We need those drives back. Dad, I so sorry for everything. Me too, honey. Hello, Kitt. What's the location of our attackers? I cannot be certain as to their location because... [system shorting] an outside source is hacking my system with surprising efficiency. [voice distorting] They will have full control in 23 seconds. Kitt's specs were on the drives. Well, what do we do? Kitt: 14 seconds. Kitt, shut down the computer now. Shutting down all systems. It can still be driven, but it has to be done manually. Weapons down. I won't ask a second time. No, no! - Ma! - Jenny! Mom. Don't move, ok? Baby. Don't try to talk. Welther: Guns! Now. Or the girl dies next. Well, Charles. This truly is a beautiful piece of machinery you've got here. You're gonna be fine, okay? Ok, just don't move. Welther: Probably get reversed engineered. by someone to recreate your A.I. for their needs. I'm so sorry. Mom, it's gonna be okay. All right? I'm guessing that even if you won't give us Prometheus, the car will. You have no idea what you're doing. You could start a war. We won't. My client might. Besides, a little war's always good for business, isn't it? Look, Il do whatever you want. Just don't hurt anyone else. Please. Cooperate, and I assure you that everyone will get out of this alive. Transport's on the way. Charles, you mind coming with us? And Sarah can stay here with the car. You two on your knees now, please. Down. Kill them. Then take the car and the girl and meet us at the rendez-vous. Move. You're leaving a messy trail. I thought you would've been smarter than that. You know, you really need to shut up. [Cocks Gun] Sarah: Mike, no. Sarah, get the hell out of here. That's my father. I'm going with you. Thank you for doing this. I'm not doing it for you. Smoke, is that you? Smoke, do you copy? Is the car's computer still shut down? Yeah, it's gotta be the kid driving. Charles, we're gonna need those codes right now. Sheriff Ramsey, if you'd be so kind. Mike, take it easy. Damn it, Mike! My father's in there! Don't you think I know that? - Graiman, give him the codes. - No. I thought this thing was bullet proof! Without the computer, the nanotechnology can't fix itself. And if we turn the computer on? We might only have ten seconds before they can get control of it. The codes, now. Mike, pull around on the outside. Sheriff, this side. No! Don't shoot! I'll give you the codes. I'll give you the codes. There's a backdoor into Prometheus. It's a simple password. That should do it. Sending it now. Wait. What are you doing? When I tell you to, turn on Kitt's computer. What for? Mike? What's he doing? Okay, Sarah. Do it. You want to see your father again? Do it. Okay, the computer's back on and it's blocking our outgoing transmission. Kitt, you there? Yes. Though I am trying to jam all frequencies coming from the suv, I afraid the outside system will still have control in eight seconds. Sorry, buddy. I think this is going to hurt. Mike, what exactly are you going to do? Kitt: Mike, Sarah, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. Dad. Dad. This doesn't change anything. Start tracing all calls immediately. Dad, you're bleeding. That's all right. Oh, careful. You sure let a girl sneak up on you. How old were you? Maybe five. I don't remember taking it. What could've made me smile like that? You don't have to leave, you know. People here care about you. I can't stay here. And what about you? Back to school? Brock, the boyfriend? Actually, I gonna stay here for a while. Make sure my dad's okay. Make sure I am. We should go. The car's waiting. This one doesn't talk too, does it? I know what today is, but there are things to discuss. Like what? By tracing calls made from the black river cell phone, last night, FBI agents recovered Charles' hard drives just outside Dubai. The encryption had not been broken. Congratulations. Charles: They arrested a middleman who was transporting the materials. But the man believed to be behind this, is still at large. The FBI knew that Charles was building another Kitt. We've known for some time. I'm resurrecting the foundation, Michael. We will be working in cooperation with the FBI. Why are you tellin' me? We want you to drive it. This is insane. No. The world is insane. This is the definition of sanity. A chance to make a difference. Rivai: We were going to use an FBI agent. But the truth is there are some missions even we can't be too closely associated with. You're ex-military. Savvy. Smart. With no family to speak of. No ties. Charles: Look, I know the timing isn't great, but we need someone immediately. You have to make a choice, Michael. Either participate or withdraw. I just... I don't believe in the same things you do. I can't help you. I'm sorry. As am I. I'm sorry about your loss. Thanks. I'm Michael. Michael Knight. I'm your father. Mike. I know. You know, I was standing by, waiting to say good-bye by myself. But I realize I said good-bye a long time ago. I was horrible to her. I blamed her for everything. She did a good job raising you. Couldn't have been easy. It wasn't easy. For either one of us. She loved you. From the very first day. So now what? You move forward. - Charles tell you? - Yeah. Look, I can't tell you what to do. That's up to you. About 25 years ago, there was a man named Walton Knight who on his deathbed told me, "one man can make a difference." I was that man. Take care of yourself. Hey, Michael. Am I gonna see you again? I hope so. I came back here that summer. You know, after school. Planned on spending every minute with you. I remember showing up at your house and your father telling me you were already gone. Up at Stanford for the summer. Suddenly it all became so clear. We may have grown up a few miles from each other, but we were both from different worlds. And right then I knew we were bound to end up in different ones. See, you say that and yet... here we are. Rivai: Two days ago, an american diplomat was found dead just outside Prague. The FBI is sending a team to investigate. 12 hours ago, they failed to check in and have failed to since then. Their last known contact was an operative known as sidewinder. We now believe sidewinder's working both sides. So be careful when you find her. Mike, Mike, Mike. Now this is a serious machine. You don't deserve it. Really. Think you could do us all a favor and avoid crashing it? Please, 'cause this time around, the FBI's picking up the tab. I'll do my best. That hardly sounds reassuring. I've recalibrated all the settings, so his system will be impossible to track. I helped. Sort of. Take care of yourself, okay? Good luck, Mike. See you soon. Well, together again. Kitt: I am incapable of happiness but I will say it seems logical that you are here. Yeah, I know what you mean. Mind if I drive? Is this going to become a habit? Definitely. All right. Latched in?
