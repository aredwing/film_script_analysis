It all happened right here, | in this very town. Across the bridge, | over by the old graveyard. It was All Hollow's Eve. Or what people like to call | Halloween. It all happened down there... in the hollow. Now on this particular evening | there's a party going on... at the home of a wealthy man | named Baltus Van Tassel. The town's folk came | from all over to celebrate. And among these revelers... was a new school master, | Ichabod Crane. This blows. Knock it off! | I'm trying to hear this. It's kinda creepy, | if you think about it. It's kinda lame, | if you think about it. Some people say that | he often resembled... a crane while walking | through town. - Karen, let's go. | - You can go, but I'm staying. Finally able to court the beautiful | young daughter of its host... Katrina Van Tassel. Guys, can't we do this | tomorrow night? Tomorrow night is the hayride. Besides, you said you wanted a | scare, right? I'll give you one. What, are you scared? It's not that. It's wrong to jump | on someone's grave. And there's that | creep groundskeeper guy. She's got a point there. Remember when we got stuck | in there, in third grade? He was just trying to scare us. The dude chased us with an ax. | Who does that? I'll tell you what. | We go up... put our hand in, | and we'll call it a night. What's the big deal | with all of this anyways? The big deal is that you, Karen | and everybody else around here... take the legacy of this town | for granted. You act like it's just | another place in the map. You're drunk. But it's not just | another place in the map. This is the birth place... of the most famous ghost story | that ever was. You're hurting me. This should be the end-all, | be-all of Halloween. But what do we got | to show for it? A junior boy storyteller... and a hooky hayride. Scott, could you please get | this gorilla off me? Hey, let her go man. I'll tell you what. All it'd take is one bad | Halloween. Like maybe three kids... going to a graveyard... and only one comes back. Then people would know... then they would know what | kind of town we live in. Go stick you hand then. What? You heard me. | You go do it. See if anything grabs you Show us how it's done. That's the spirit. See? Nothing. Oh my God! | Oh God, please help me! Jackass! It's fun. Where are you going? | It was just a joke. Where are you going? You guys be careful out there. | And remember... - if you see the horseman... | - Make through the bridge. And as Ichabod recalls | the horrible warning... he kicked, whipped and yelled | at his horse... urging it to go faster. The headless horseman | was just behind him. Sparks flew from the hooves | of the rider's unholy steed. And Ichabod looked up... and through the trees he could see | the bridge. Ichabod and his horse dashed | across the bridge. The headless horseman | just behind him. Ichabod chanced to look back... expecting to see | the fearful apparition gone. But instead... he saw the horseman | stand up in his stirrups... cough back his arm that held | the rider's bloody head... with gore and guts still | clinging to the skull... and he fired the hideous missile. And that was the last that anyone | ever saw of the new schoolmaster. Some say that Ichabod actually | escaped from the horseman. And left Sleepy Hollow to become | a lawyer in New York. Not far from here. While others say that it's Brom | who chased him out of town... out of jealousy. But the old Dutch wives of | these parts still maintain... that Ichabod Crane... the new schoolmaster was chased | on that Halloween evening... by the most horrific | gull ever seen. The Headless Horseman | of Sleepy Hollow. - Hi! That was super! | - Thank you. Where's dad? He wanted to come, sweetie, | but he was exhausted. I think the start of the season, | and the moving... and everything really took it | out of him. - You know... | - Yeah, I know. - Thank you for coming. | - Sure. See ya. Look, I sad I was sorry. | What else you want me to do? How can you just stand there and | let him treat me like that? Hey, he just gets carried away | with this whole legend. He's proud of the history | around here, or something. - Besides, you're having fun. | - No, I wasn't. Really? You know... somebody dared him to put | his hand in the tomb. Who was it? I just wanted to get even. Is there something to do with | that whole 'scared of sex' thing? Maybe. Who was that? That's not funny, Scott. It's Brody. He's screwing | around in the shanty. - Scott, please don't... | - Just stay here. I'm sick of this. Brody! The door's open. Spooky. Very spooky. | You had me going for a sec. Amber, come here... Scott? That was great! I'm already giving you a ride. | You can stop flattering. No, I mean it though, | you're good. In addition, thank you for the | ride, I really appreciate it. No problem. So... where's Brody? | Didn't you guys come together? No. Brody's got a | short attention spam. But then he's captain | of the football team. - So I guess it pays, right? | - I guess. I guess I thought you guys | had a thing. No, we're not a thing. I mean, I was like am I getting | myself into trouble here? New in town, already making moves | on the quarterback's squeeze. First of, I'm nobody's squeeze. And second, | Brody isn't exactly my ideal. I like a guy who's interested in | more than just my poms poms. Maybe we should, | I don't know... like go for a coffee or something | some time. Oh my God! - Are you alright? | - I'm fine, just a little shaky. Are you sure you're alright? You scared the crap out of us. | Are you okay? I'm doing about as well as | to be expected... which I don't suppose | it's all that good. What were you doing in the middle | of the road? I could've killed you. I was listening, teacher, | listening. - Why are you calling me that? | - Lan, he's a grave keeper... and he's obviously drunk. My name is Klaus Van Ripper, | although that doesn't mean much. And I'm not drunk. | I do take care of the cemetery. And I need to talk to you. | There's something you need to know. Lan, let's get out of here. | He's obviously drunk. Come on, let him have his bed. | Let's go. I almost killed the guy. I can't | leave him out here if he's drunk. Quiet. Somebody's coming. What are you doing out here? You hear that? What? You okay, Junior? | Looks like you've seen a ghost. You been at the yard, haven't you? | What were you doing up there? Just trying to give a guy | a little scare. Trying to instill | a little history in him. You should understand that. You shouldn't be up in the yard. | Not tonight. Not ever. | Especially not tonight. Relax, Van Ripper! We didn't mess up any | of your landscaping. I'm sorry about straying you. No, it's okay. | Lan was taking me for coffee. Beg your pardon... but you should go with the | young venture snob here. I need to talk | to the teacher alone. What? He's come back, | he's come back for you. I need to talk to you. - Let's go. | - Lan? I can't leave this guy in the | middle of the road. Look at him, | he's obviously smashed. I don't want him to get hit | by somebody else, alright? Rain check? Are you sure you | don't wanna sit, son? I can't. I'm already out way | passed my curfew. My dad's gonna kill me. I don't even know why | I came here in the first place. You don't hu? But I think you do. | It's your destiny. You can't run from | your destiny, teacher. What are you talking about? What's up with | all this teacher crap? You are a stubborn one, | aren't you? I have to go. I'm really sorry, | but I do have to go. I call you teacher, | because that's what you are. Not by your trade, | not even by your dad's trade... but farther back. Yeah, way farther back | than that. Your family lived here | right in this house... nine generations back. A teacher, a man called Ichabod. Ichabod? Like Ichabod Crane? | Are you kidding me? Is this your big talk? | My last name is not even Crane. No time for kidding. I know | your last name, I'll show you. Your last name is right... Maybe some other time, Klaus. | I gotta go, okay? Wait! Wait, teacher! | You gotta listen to me. Now listen. | You gotta let me show ya. I know you don't believe it, | but if you just let me show ya. In the graveyard, Irving's grave | is covered with vines... and the vines | are flowing with blood. Stop it! You already messed up | my night with Karen... you made me drive all the way | out here and I'm late. And why? Because you wanted | to get drunk. I gotta go, alright? Wait, wait now! What? You might make it. | I don't fell nothing. Go on. Go on! And I ain't drunk. You hear me? | I ain't drunk. Hello? Klaus, is that you? Brody? You alright, Junior? Looks like you've seen a ghost. | Again. For Christ's sake, man. | Look what you've done to my car. Relax! You car is not worth | but 500 bucks. What are you doing out here? Just trying to warm | poor Carter here. He's been itching to get out. Also wanted to see if I can | still fit in this costume. It looks really nice. | Do you have a key for this gate? Nope. | Nobody does. That gate's been locked up | since forever. You gotta go back | over the bridge. You know, man, | I've been thinking... You should leave that to the | professionals, honestly. Well, I think you should stop | hanging around Karen so much. You know, date somebody | on your on level. My own level, hu? Look man, we had a long talk... when I took her home tonight, it's | all about us at the homecoming. You know what Brody, | Karen is a big girl... and I think you should let her | make her own decision, okay? Lan, you and I are gonna have | to talk about this later. Now you better get to sleep. | I want you at practice tomorrow. I can't. You can and you will. | End of story. You broke curfew | and you own me. - You're gonna be part of the team. | - I'm part of the team, dad. Lan! Lan, hi! I can't believe you're leading | the poor kid on like that. It's carmically unsound. Well, excuse me Mrs. Morality. | Maybe I like him. He's funny, smart and | still in high school. If you're trying to make | Brody jealous... I can always set you up | with one of Rod's friend. Thanks, but no thanks. I have this | thing with guys... who have Greek letters | tattooed on their ass. Tattoos beats it. - Hi. | - Nice outfit. Thank you. It's the pep-rally | today. You're coming right? I'd like to, | but I just really can't. With the football team and all, | I just feel out of place. Walk me to first, | and I'll talk you in to it. Good morning students. | Welcome to the homeroom bulletin. Don't forget, tonight is the | annual ghostly hayride... and tickets | are selling out fast. If you still wanna go, come down | to the student store... as soon as possible. | See you at the pep-rally. Would mean a lot to me if you came. | You won't feel out of place. I'll be doing all my | cheers for you. Your cheers for me? You guys seen Scott? I got first with him and need | to copy his homework. You're the one who left him in | the graveyard last night, remember? Maybe him and Amber | pulled an all-nighter. I haven't seen Amber either. And she never called me back | last night. This is bad. Wait. Do you think something | happened to them? No. But it's the fiftieth time | I've showed without my homework. Coast is gonna flunk me. Unless... you got Galantine for geometry, | don't you? Guys, I'm gonna go. | Talk to you later. Give it up. Fine. Just do me a favor. Will you get some wrong, so she | know it's yours at least. Whatever. Yes Mrs. Dandan, I'll look into it. | Meanwhile you just sit and relax. If anything comes up | I'll call you. Okay, bye. Sheriff, you gotta put a stop | to his hayride. It ain't safe for the kids to be up | in the yard. Not tonight. Van Ripper, it's a little early in | the morning for this garbage. He's come back, I'm telling you. | He's come back. He's gonna be looking | for a head. It' ain't safe for anybody in that | yard, it's gonna be fair game. I won't go through this kinda | crap again this year. For the sake of repetition and | clarity, tonight is Halloween. Sheriff, there are vines growing | out of Irving's grave. I'm telling you, the horseman | has returned. Tonight is Halloween, and also the | day of our annual ghostly hayride. And it's gonna go off without | a hitch... just like it does | every other year. This ain't no normal year, | not this year. The young teacher has come back | and he woke him up. Here, let me show you. You see this? | Look at the name on that. - Right there. | - Where did you get this? Out of the mailbox. | Did you see the name there? The Cranstons are good people. And I'd like to make a good | first impression with them. You go intrude in their mailbox | like some kind of maniac... that doesn't do good | on my program. You're not listening to me Sheriff. | You gotta stop the hayride tonight. Request denied. | Denied. Now I got some teenagers playing | hooky that I gotta attend to... and you gotta go. You're gonna be picking up | heads out of the graveyard. Well, I should only | be so lucky right? Teacher. - What are you doing here? | - We didn't finish our talk. Look, Klaus, we're already | discussed this. I'm not a Crane, alright? | I'm not. You are a Crane, yes you are. | Let me show you. See? Ichabod left. | Changed his name right away. Probably because he's worried | with the horseman coming after him. Then he named his first son | Richard Cranson... meaning Crane's son. | Then two generations later... his grandson went down west | and changed his name... to Cranston. | That's you. All that means is that there really | was an Ichabod... and maybe I'm related to him. The guy who wrote this book. | What's his name? Washington Irving. Maybe he just knew Ichabod. Used the guy's name. | Ever think about that? He knew him alright. | He wrote the story about him. But the legend's true all the same. | Everything in it is true. Ichabod was killed | by the horseman, right? There's absolutely no way | he could've kids, or... You know that's not true. The story says that he | was never seen again. But not been seen again is not | the same thing as not been alive. You take it, read it, and learn | everything by tonight, understand? You're in big trouble, mister. You said you'd be at the | pep-rally today. No, I didn't. You're going to before | Brody interrupted us. Maybe. Shouldn't you | be there right now? I thought you knew that | by heart. No, I just watch the cartoon | like every Halloween. So how's this book more important | than you coming to my pep-rally? That old guy Klaus | gave to me. He was telling me I'm | related to Ichabod. Ichabod Crane? | Was there really such a guy? Apparently so. | There's a whole book about him. Come on, what does crazy Klaus | knows about that? He says he's related to | Hans Van Ripper. Who's Hans Van Ripper? I guess it's just some guy that let | Ichabod stay at his guest house. Who knew? There's a lot of | cool stuff in here, actually. Stuff about the bridge and how the | horseman can't cross it... 'cause if he does he just like | burst into flames or something. Spontaneously combust. So what are my chances | of getting that coffee? I finish practice around 4 pm, | that sounds good? Yes perfect, cheerleading | goes 'till about that too. That's if they don't | fire you first. Fire me? No. | I'm the best they got. So you wanna meet me in my | car around 4:30, that's good? - Yeah, okay. | - Hello, lan. Hey you two. I just wanted to tell you how | excellent you were last night. Wasn't he? I told you. I knew you were an actor the first | time I laid eyes on you. You've got a lot of talent, | my dear. Thank you. | That's actually a lot of fun. That's good! Good! So I was wondering, | can I ask you a favor? Yes, go ahead. I know this is really last minute | and you can say no if you want... but we just had a part | open up on the hayride tonight. It's the role of the | graveyard guy. I was wondering if you could help | us out. It'd be fabulous. I thought Scott was | gonna do that. He was, but he never came by | to pick up his costume. Not to mention there's | a whole script to learn... and I know what a quick | study you are. There's a John Carpenter film | festival thing on tonight... and I really want to watch it. Can you tape it? | Please, I'm getting desperate. - You'd be so perfect. | - Come on, lan. And you get to introduce | the White Lady's tomb. Okay, fine, I'll do it. Excellent. So you come by | the drama room... - to pick up your costume, okay? | - Absolutely. And don't forget to invite me | to the wedding. There's no wedding, just | a lot of sweaty sex. See, it's this kinda lack of | commitment I'm talking about. This is what keeps you guys | from being number one! What's so difficult about | making it to practice everyday? Now you got ten minutes | to get your butts on that field. And I don't wanna see | any screwing around. David, get lan. Damn it, Hartman. | You're loosing the wrist. You see? See what I told you? | Just relax. Use your opponent's momentum | to your own advantage. Again. That movement is completely | illegal... and you'd be disqualified | in competition. However, I do admire | your instincts. Lan, take a break. Jocks. You guys are big, but you're | still playing soft. When I played ball, you had | to be though as nails... and have a hard hand. Now I want you to get out there | and focus on your power today. Okay? Alright. Thanks, David. I want you to go out there and | keep an eye on those guys... - before they hurt themselves. | - Sure. Listen pal, I don't care what | you do on your spare time. You wanna waste it with | comic books and horror movies... fine! | But when you're at school... you'll get your butt | to practice. I was at practice. As long as you live under my roof, | you'll quit acting like an idiot. That means no more fencing. | You're on JV Football. Then I guess I'm gonna have | to find another place to live. - Will you think about it? | - I will. Lan? I know, I know. My dad | pulled me off practice. At least you don't have to | carry these things around. They're nice. - Wanna trade? | - Okay. - Why are you laughing? | - No reason. - Show me your stands. | - On guard! - Like this? | - That's pretty good. - Your turn | . - Alright, you asked for it. Headless... Horseman... he's our man. If he can't do it, | no one can. Go, Horseman! Very good. Cute. Very cute. - Your dad would be proud, Junior. | - Thanks. Brody, what do you want? - Can I talk with you for a sec? | - Sure, go ahead. In private. She's all yours. Look, it's about the homecoming. Everybody knows you're the only | one I can go with. Would you settle | for a maybe? Maybe, what do you | mean maybe? Don't you got like | a better offer? Well, there may be a dark horse | in the running. Junior? You're joking, right? I know you've been hanging | around him to get me jealous. Look, it worked, okay? Now let the guy go, | let him get over you. You need to get over yourself. Mrs. Winter said you'll be taking | Scott's spot tonight. Who do you think you are? | You're not even from here. Anyway... if you screw up, don't build | me up right... I'm gonna beat your ass. Okay, thanks Brody. | That's nice. - I'll keep that in mind. | - You do that. I used to think that his entire | life revolved around football... but now I just think | that he lives... upon that stupid | Headless Horseman costume. Hi sweetheart, how's school? Fine. Dad won't quit with | this football thing. He just wants your | high school experience... to be something to remember. Yeah. My high school | experience. I'm gonna see | the hayride tonight. You are? That's great. | What is it? It's like this annual thing | our school does. The drama teacher asked | me to do it. I'm sure dad will be thrilled. Give him a chance. He does love you, he just has | his own way of showing it. Anyway, n you do me a favor? Sure. I set up the VCR in the back... and there's a couple of movies | I want you to tape it. Just please, whatever you do, | don't let dad touch it, okay? Listen me well, | and read my tongue. Our journey into darkness | has just begun. As we travel through | the graveyard tonight... hold on to your loved ones, | very tight. For as the dead arise | from sleep... its towards the light | that they'll creep. And if this truck | should have a wreck... they'll sink their teeth | into your neck. And now we begin the | ghostly hayride. Now we just have to head | down this path right here... towards the bridge. | And you should know... this is the same road that | Ichabod traveled upon... on that fateful | Halloween night. The north woods area | of Sleepy Hollow... is long known for being | densely populated by... spirits and specters of | every imaginable shape... and size. Watch yourself. Alright, folks. And this, my companions, is the | section of the haunted wood... that is inhabited by the most | beautiful ghost of all. The ill-fated bride who | was slashed... murdered by her own | groom-to-be. Discarded in the lake, | not far from here. If you look closely... you can see the unearthed | beauty right now. Let's go. Folks, seems like we almost made it | out of the haunted woods... alive. But seems like | we forgot one thing. The most fearsome legend | of all Sleepy Hollow... The legend of... Did you heart that? Give me your head! Let's go! - You jerk! | - Geez Karen, relax! Are you crazy? You're gonna scare | the poor kids to death! That's what they came here for. | Besides... what's wrong with a little scare | every now and then? Jackass. Alright, looks like we've made it | out of the haunted woods alive. But I tell you what, | the night is young... and the Headless Horseman is | still out there looking... Iooking for a head. That was even better | than last night. Thanks. I'd go again but your dad's waiting | for me to come home and help him. It's fine. Are you okay? - Yes. Thanks for coming. | - Sure. Teacher. I need to talk to you now. Here's your change. The ticket. | Have a good time. Hello, Mrs. VanHaton. | I'm glad you could make it. I'm only here to make sure none | of those morons damage anything. Those tombstones, some of them | are over a hundred years old. Not to worry, I hand picked | everyone who is involved. I guess they're lucky stars. What you want me to do? | I can't just take off. - I made a commitment to do this. | - It's too dangerous. You can't go up there. | You can't take the chance. Listen Klaus, this isn't | funny anymore. Forget the hayride! | You gotta come with me. But I can't go, I already told her | I'd do it. See you after. Lan, you're getting | great reviews. - Thanks. | - Hello, Mr. VanRipper. I was telling the young teacher you | gotta call this whole thing off. You can't go on this hayride. | I can't let him go up there. You know we can't do that. | What is this all about anyway? The vines are growing, | they're full of blood... they're feeding the horseman | and he's getting stronger. I read your book, it didn't | say one thing about vines. Not everything's gotta to be | in the book. Excuse me, Sheriff? What can I do for you, Nancy? Dunkin, good groundskeeper here | has been hitting the bottle, again. I'm not drunk. I'm telling you | for the last time... the Dark Rider is afoot. | Don't be damn fools. I can't have you spoil the hayride | like that. What about a ride home? No, No. Now listen to me, you're | the only one that can save us. You got to stand up to him, | face him... if you don't, all of us | are gonna die. Do you hear me? | We're gonna die. Alright, Klaus. Let's say you and | me take a walk up the cemetery... and clear all the kids out? Would that make you | feel better? Yes, but what about] | The teacher? The teacher will be fine. | Let's me and you do that. - Com on. | - Thank you. You're doing a wonderful job | my dear... but there's a very grumpy and | influential old lady on this one. Now it'd be a great time | to shine. Listen me well, | and read my... Excuse me, beautiful boy, | but this hay stinks. Okay. Here's what I can do. I'll talk to | the organizers when we get back... and I'll get it all | taken care of. Yes, be sure to do that. Listen me well, | and read my tongue. Our journey into darkness | has just begun. As we travel through | the graveyard tonight... hold on to your loved ones, | with all your might. Sorry you two, | this one is all full. - What? Come on Mrs. Worthen. | - How long till the next one? Not 'til next year, I'm afraid. | This was the last trip. I'm sorry. We can still go, we'll just make | our own tour. I bet there's nobody | watching the gate. We can just climb over. Erika, the thing is sold out. Let's go home, rent a couple | of scare flicks... make some marguerites | and it'll be fine. You sound like | my parents. Come on Rob. Let's put the | fun back in funeral. Teach me the meaning of the | word 'bone yard'. - Erika... | - I can't believe it. You're scared. | Aren't you? You're afraid to go into the | graveyard, like a little bitch. - I'm not a little bitch. | - Yeah? Prove it. Okay. What are you doing, Sheriff? | You're heading the wrong way. You're going back to town. Just take it easy Klaus. A good night of sleep | will take care of everything. You haven't heard a word | I've said. I'm telling you... the Horseman is back, | he's on the prowl. Tomorrow Brody'll be the captain of | the varsity football team again... but tonight can't you let the kids | have their fun? They'll be having loads of fun once | some heads starts to roll. Sheriff. Don't stop! We gotta go back. | We gotta go back and warn them What's that? That's some costume, ain't it? Sheriff, don't get outta the car! | Sheriff! Brody, aren't you supposed | to be up in the forest? Lt'll disappoint a lot of folks if | they don't get to see the horseman. Don't you think you should | get up there? Brody? Wait a minute... Are you happy? Is this | what you wanted to do? - Not like this. | - I thought this is what you wanted. For one thing, I'm freezing. | It's like two degrees out here. Not exactly inspiring to | take my clothes off. - Okay. You wanna get out of here? | - No. - I've got a better idea. | - What? - In there? | - Sure. Why not? I don't know, it's a shanty | in the middle of the graveyard. I know. What you say? A little doggie style | with the dead? A little 'zombie frombie'? Could be kinda kinky. That's it Rob. | That's perfect. Please, don't stop. Rob? | I said 'don't stop'. You know what? | Just forget it. I said 'just forget it'. Well, well... Looks like we almost made it out | the haunted woods. But it seems we've forgotten | about one thing. The most fearsome legend | in all... Help! He's gonna kill us! | He's gonna kill us all! - What are you talking about? | - The Headless Horseman. There's no such thing | as the Headless Horseman. Then what the hell is that? Distasteful. - Start the truck. | - We're supposed... Give me your head. | I need a head. Start the damn truck right now! Who's that guy? Brody, no! God, that looks real. That is real. Brody, look out! Shit! Lan? - What are you doing here? | - What's going on? - No, no... come on. | - What? Come on, let's go. | We gotta go. Stop. Stop! | What is going on? - What are you doing? | - This is ridiculous. Come here! I gotta get you | on that truck. - Why? | - Because I have to! Because people are dieing. - What? | - Erika's dead. What? What are you... Keep running, okay? | Just come on. That's right punk ass! | You don't want none! Take it back to mama! Help! Help! | Help! - Why did you stop for? | - That. The Horseman is coming back. | We're all gonna die. - Get in. | - Let's go. Hold on. - Get them outta here, alright? | - Wait! Karen, get back in the car. No way, not until you tell me | what's going on. There's no time, | get back in the car! Lan, I'm staying with you. Get out of here. We'll lead him | the other way. Go on! Hurry up! Let's go! Help me! Help me! | Get me out of here. Help! Help! Help! Help! Shit! Help! Get me out of here. Alright. Chill out. You got any idea | how to do that? Go to the driver's side, it's open, | unlock the doors from there. Don't pay attention to him! | You can't help him now. - Open the door! | - What are you talking about? The man is a dead body | right here! Come on, son. Open the door, | you can do it, I know you can. You can do it. Unlock it. Here we go. We gotta help the young teacher | or else everybody is gonna die. If you're getting there, I'm going | to the good side of the bridge. Listen to me, | there are people there. Your girl's up there too, | she's in trouble. What are you gonna do | about her? She made a decision, | she chose Junior. Listen son, this is real. You're part of a new legend | of young avengers. When people tell your story | a hundred years from now... you wanna be known as | a coward or as a hero? Alright. - Alright damn it! Let's do it. | - That's right. Lan, wait, I can't. Yes, you can. Come on! Yes, you can. | Just please, get up. Shit! There's a cabin over there. | Just go there and lock yourself... No lan, I'm staying with you. No you're not. Go. | I'll be right back. I promise. Just go! | Lock the door! My God! | My God! - Karen! | - The shanty. It's that way. - God! Get me out of here. | - Get away from the window. - No, I can't. | - Yes, you can. - You can. Just do it! | - You don't know what's back here. - Is the teacher with you? | - Karen, get away from the window. - Where's the teacher? | - I don't know. You two get to the bridge | as fast as you can. You're not coming with us? No. Me and the teacher got to | meet the Headless. Go on! - Are you alright, teacher? | - Yeah. Oh my God! You killed him. You can't kill him, it's already | dead. Let's go. Come on Klaus. What? Come on, get up! Get up. Here. Let's go. | Come on. Lan, run! - My God! | - Come on guys, don't stop! - God! I thought you were... | - I know. I know. Are you okay? It's over. | I promise, it's over. Over? Nothing's over. What are you talking about? | We crossed the bridge. The Horseman has no power | over here, right? What about the hayride people? - I busted the gate, they got out. | - You did what? I wrecked the fence. The one | that leads into the graveyard. - Oh dear Lord! | - What? Dear Lord what? The Horseman wants me, right? I'm on the other side | of the bridge... there's no way | he can get me here, right? Not in particular, teacher, you may | be the last of your lineage... he'll take your head if he's given | the choice... but tonight that Horseman wants | a Crane, any Crane will do. My dad. Losers. Hello? We need something from the | Horseman's own time. How are we gonna find something | from the Revolutionary War? Right here. Now this here is | my great great great... is my great great great great | grand, what the hell... is an ancestor of mine. He's in there with a full military | uniform, and there's a sword. Now we gotta push this thing off. | Everybody pull together. Push. Open it up. Right son, grab that sword. | Go on. You gotta run this straight | through the demon's heart... and send him straight | back to hell. - You think you can do that? | - Yeah. What's this? The program lan wanted to watch. | It's got it all set up to tape. I don't wanna watch this. | Where's the remote? - Come on, give it to me. | - No. - Lucy, give it to me. | - No. Give it to me. - Give it to me. | - No. I'll get it. Trick or treat! Honey, we got customers. - Are you The Death? | - No, I am. Look at you guys! | Great costumes. Thanks. - Carl, turn it back. | - Honey, don't start. It's more trick or treaters, | you get it. Carl, you didn't go to either | of his things. The least you can do is | let me tape his program. Here. Okay, you little block heads. | It's called 'trick or treat'. If I give you candy, you're | suppose to go play... ding-dong-ditch somewhere else. Okay. No more candy. See how you like the dark. | Little bastards. Is everything okay? Just some kids | screwing around. It's what Halloween | is for, right? Come on. | When was the last time... we watched a scary movie? I never liked these things. What are you talking about? You used to take me | to these all the time. Well... somebody told me... that girls get horny | when they're scared. Well, it worked. Yes, it did. - Must be those kids. | - Didn't sound like kids. - Get inside! | - Lan! - Get inside right now. | - What are you doing? - What's going on? | - Come here, get away from the door. - Sweetie, hi. | - Just do what I say. Who made this movie? | What else did he do? What the hell? How was the second hayride? | Where did you get that sword? Lan, you're acting | like an idiot. Lan! Mom, get out of the way... - Damn! | - Dad, no! Damn those kids! Are you okay? - Klaus? | - Teacher. It worked, he ran off. No, the Horseman don't run, | you know that as well as I do. He's gonna gather more strength, | get some heads and feed the vines. - What am I suppose to do now? | - You gotta go after him. Are you crazy old man? My son | is not going after that lunatic. He's not going alone, you're | going with him, coach. Nobody's going anywhere, not | until we call the police. Yeah, except now the | sheriff's laying there... with a stump instead of a head. What? Dad, it's us. We're the only ones | that can stop him... nobody else, just us. What do we got to do with this? We're Cranes, descendants | of Ichabod Crane. Lan, you sound crazy. | What are you talking about? I know how we sound, dad. | I know. What makes you think we'll | be able to stop him? Because we have | done it before... and we have to do it again, | we have to. Just trust me, okay? Please. What's that? Damn it! Where is he? What was that? Son of a bitch. Dad, where is he? Did you hear that? Dad? Dad? What's the matter with you, | you sick son of a bitch? You're gonna take the head of a | Crane when he's down, hu? Why don't you come to battle | you bastard? Come on! Hey, Horseman, you hear me? | I beat you. The Cranes beat you again. | How do you like it? We beat you. In his heart teacher. | Drive it through his heart. That's it teacher, you got him. - Jesus! | - Teacher! Teacher, the bridge! - I'm real proud of you, teacher. | - Thank you. There's your dad. Lan! - Are you okay, dad? | - Hell yes. Took a lot worse when | I played ball... back then you had to be | tough as nails. And have a hard head | too, right? Don't worry, son. You award will be far greater | than the warm soft embrace... of tender woman flesh. You just remember our deal. Oh yeah. You're a hero. | You are a hero, young Vander... - Viere. | - Whatever. That's the way | I'm gonna write it. Coach, wait up. Are you planning | on making babies? I was thinking about taking her to | the homecoming dance first, but... I mean in the future | Because if you are... you have to | promise me something. What's that? They're gotta have your | last name... or else you're gonna | have a higgledy-piggledy. I ain't going through this | again. Deal? - Yes, that's a deal? | - Promise? Deal. Let's take you home, hu Klaus?
