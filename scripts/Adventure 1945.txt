Want to catch us a hen. Well, I bet it won't work, but... here goes. COCK-A-DOODLE-DO! COCK-A-DOODLE-DO! I thought you said we'd catch us a hen. We will, but hens are realists. No hen would come running for a rooster she can't see. What'd you do that for? That line hypnotizes him. That's why some people stay in ruts. There's a line like that on the library floor. Stick with your chickens. OK. Now, here's a rooster in a rut. He wanted war and glory, so he came out here to fight another rooster. A rooster's got imagination, see? That's why that corny imitation of yours fooled him. Now make like a hen, Emily. Oh, no, now we really have a rooster. I should imitate a rooster. Nope. Make like a hen. Oh, all right, Sailor. I'll prove you wrong. YOU SEE? IT DOESN' MAKE SENSE. IF SHE WAS GOING TO CHASE AFTER THIS ROOSTER, WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE MADE ROOSTER NOISES? NO HEN WANTS A ROOSTER UNLESS SHE'S AFRAID SOME OTHER HEN'S GOING TO GET HIM! WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR? WHAT? OH, PULLETS ARE BETTER EATIN'. BESIDES, I COULD NEVER KILL A ROOSTER.

STICK TO YOUR TOMATOES! YOU'VE GOT YOUR ANSWER! A GOOD CRACK ON THE JAW WOULD DO YOU GOOD. IF THAT WOULD DO IT, I'D LOVE IT! I'D LOVE TO LOOK UP TO A MAN, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HIT HARD ENOUGH! I'D RATHER HE HIT ME THAN LISTEN TO HIM! WORDS COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH, YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR SOMETHING. YOU GET HIT WITH FEATHERS! IT, IT, IT, IT! GET DOWN! NOBODY TALKS TO ME AND GETS AWAY WITH IT! "IT"? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT "IT" IS! "IT'S" THE EXCITEMENT, SEE? EXCITEMENT THAT DON'T DIE! I'VE SEEN LIFE IMPORTANT! OH, HAVE I! JUST LET 'EM THINK THEY'RE GONNA LOSE IT! I'VE SEEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN TRAMPLED ON TO GET INTO LIFEBOATS AND THEN THEY'RE ALL SAFE AND ALL BORED AGAIN! ALL BORED!

THE LAST TIME I KISSED HARRY WAS ON THAT SOFA AT THE FARM. DO YOU REALIZE I HAVEN' SEEN EITHER ONE OF YOU SINCE? I MEAN, I KISS HARRY ON THE SOFA, NEXT TIME I SEE HIM AND KISS HIM AGAIN, A LITTLE ITEM, DEAR! HE'S MARRIED BETWEEN KISSES! OK, GIRLS, OK. WHAT DO YOU SAY? THIS IS FINE, BUT IT'S A LITTLE DRY. I'LL GET CLEANED UP AND GO OUT AND GET A BUCKET OF WINE. THIS CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION. THIS CALLS FOR ME TO GET OUT. I GET IT. I'M LATE FOR THE OFFICE. NO, NO. YOU'RE CRAZY. NO OFFICE TODAY. WE'LL CELEBRATE, THE 3 OF US! REALLY? YES, YES! GOOD OLD RENO! WE BROUGHT IT BACK WITH US, DARLING, DIDN'T WE? YOU KNOW IT! HOOK HER, EMILY, HOOK HER! HA HA! YOU CRAZY ABOUT HIM? JUST CRAZY. HE CRAZY ABOUT YOU? JUST CRAZY. OH... OH, EMILY! NOW, TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT. YOU ARRIVE AT RENO, "LET NO MAN PUT ASUNDER," AND THEN- THEN WHAT'D YOU DO? WE PLAYED ROULETTE. YOU DID? AND THEN HE BOUGHT ME A HAT. THAT'S BETTER. ISN'T IT SILLY? I LOVE IT. AND THEN WE HAD A STEAK. STEAK'S A STEAK ANYTIME, ISN'T IT? HEY, WHERE'S THE TOWELS? BEHIND THE DOOR. BEHIND THE WHAT? BEHIND THE DOOR. HUH! FUNNY PLACE TO KEEP 'EM! SQUAWKING ALREADY! HEY, I GOT TO GET MYSELF UNDER A ROOF! I'LL GET A ROOM AS CLOSE BY AS I CAN. WELL, WAI A MINUTE, HELEN! I MEAN, LET ME SEE, I... WHOA, WHOA! FUNNY, I NEVER GAVE IT A THOUGHT, I MEAN, ABOUT LIVING. WE HADN' EVEN MENTIONED IT. LET'S TAKE A SHORT PAUSE BEFORE THE PARTY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THINK YOU'LL LIVE HERE, OR GET A LITTLE HOUSE SOMEPLACE? I DON'T KNOW. WHERE ARE WE GOING TO LIVE, HARRY? NEVER GAVE I A THOUGHT. WELL, NOW, LOOK, YOU TWO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE TODAY. HERE'S YOUR APARTMENT. YOU CAN'T BEAT I FOR TWO ANYPLACE. BUT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, I'D THINK YOU'D LIKE A LITTLE HOUSE WITH A GARDEN. ANYWAY, I GET MYSELF A ROOM- OH, HELEN, I'D HATE TO TURN YOU OUT. OH, DON'T BE SILLY. A ROOF'S A ROOF, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. WAIT A MINUTE, HELEN, HOLD IT. THIS ISN'T GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WITH YOU GIRLS. I'M SHIPPIN' OU IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. THEN YOU TWO GIRLS KEEP ON LIVING HERE, JUST AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL. YOU'RE SHIPPING OUT? WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOIN'? I'M A SAILOR, AIN'T I? YES, OF COURSE, BUT... I GUESS I THOUGHT YOU'D GO TO WORK HERE OR SOMETHING. WELL, I GUESS I JUS THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO STAY. WELL, I... I GUESS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT. A SHORE JOB? ME? HA! EMILY! OH, NO, DEAR, OF COURSE NOT! IT'S FUNNY. ALL... ALL THINKING STOPS. LOVE'S A DRUG, ISN'T IT? OH, BUT, HARRY, WHEN YOU COME BACK, YOU WANT A PLACE OF YOUR OWN TO COME BACK TO, DON'T YOU? WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THIS PLACE? WELL... NOTHING, IF I'M NOT HERE. HOW DO YOU BOTHER ME ANY? WELL, YOU DON' WANT ME AROUND WHEN YOU COME HOME, DO YOU? OH, YOU MEAN THERE'S ONLY ONE ROOM. SURE. 'COURSE I CAN GO SIT IN A GUTTER SOMEPLACE, BUT THAT ISN'T WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. A MAN DOESN'T WAN ANOTHER WOMAN AROUND IF THERE ARE A THOUSAND ROOMS. WELL, THAT'S A BED, AIN'T IT? THAT? HURTS YOU TO SIT ON IT! WELL, IT WON'T KILL YOU TO SLEEP ON I A COUPLE OF NIGHTS, WILL IT? YOU WANT TO BE WITH EMILY WHILE I'M GONE, DON'T YOU? WHAT'S THE USE OF GETTIN' A ROOM FOR A COUPLE OF NIGHTS? BUT, ANYWAY, DO AS YOU WANT. I AIN'T GONNA TELL YOU HOW TO SLEEP. BUT, HARRY, THAT ISN'T THE IDEA. A MAN WANTS A HOME OF HIS OWN. A MAN'S GOT A GARDEN, FOR INSTANCE. HE THINKS ABOUT I WHILE HE'S AWAY, WONDERS HOW IT'S GROWING. DOES HE? CERTAINLY! MAN'S GOT TO WONDER HOW SOMETHING'S GROWING- A GARDEN OR A BABY OR- WHAT BABY? HUH? OH... YOU MEAN A BABY. WELL, YOU KNOW, FOR A MINUTE I THOUGH YOU WAS TALKING ABOU ANOTHER FRIEND OF YOURS. MY MISTAKE, MY MISTAKE. A BABY, HUH? DO YOU WAN A BABY, PAL? NOPE. SHE'S ON A RAMPAGE, AND YOU'RE ALL WOUND UP, BOY! HELEN, WHY DON' YOU GET MARRIED? YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'D LIKE IT. THE OTHER NIGHT, YOU WEREN'T GIVING IT VERY MUCH. ANYWAY, I NEVER KNOW WHEN I'LL BE BACK. I'M LIABLE TO BE SHIPPED ANYWHERE. I'M LIABLE TO NO SEE YOU FOR YEARS. ARE OF YOU SURPRISED ABOUT ANYTHING? ROOM'S KIND OF LOS A LOT OF IT'S, UH... OH, NO, HARRY, NO. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH, LET'S GET GOING AGAIN. YOU KNOW, WINE GOES GREAT IN THE MORNING, AND THE 3 OF US WILL GO OUT. WE'LL FIND SOME OF THE BOYS, AND WE'LL HAVE A PARTY UNTIL THE SHIP SAILS. THAT'LL TAKE CARE OF THE BEDS. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, LADIES. GEE, IT'S... IT'S 8:30. HEY, EMILY... YEAH? IT'S, UH... IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT... YOU KNOW SAILORS ARE KIND OF CRAZY, AND... I'D NIP THAT BIRD RIGHT IN THE BUD AND TELL HIM WHAT'S WHAT. ALL THAT TALK I GAVE HIM ABOUT THE PRIZE HE'D WON- HE KNOWS IT, DOES HE? YES, HE DOES. HIM... IF HE WAS MINE, I'D STICK AN ANCHOR ON HIM BEFORE 10:00 THIS MORNING. I'M AFRAID HE'D DRAG IT A LITTLE. NO, HELEN, JUST TO KEEP THE RECORD STRAIGHT, I WALKED RIGHT INTO THIS. I KNEW HE WAS A CRAZY GUY. I HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK IT OVER, BUT I DIDN'T. I'M NOT BLAMING HARRY AT ALL. I'M BUYING HIS WINE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I'LL SEE YOU LATER. OK. HI! HI. I GOT CHAMPAGNE, AND I GOT THE BEST BOTTLE OF BRANDY IN FRISCO. WHICH DO YOU WANT? HEY! WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WANT A DIVORCE. HUH? WAIT A MINUTE. DON'T LET'S WAIT, HARRY. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN WAITING, DO WE, HARRY? OK... YOU SAY YOU WANT A DIVORCE, AND I SAY, "WHY?" HMM? AND I SAY, "LOOK, MISTER... " WHAT IS OUR NAME? PATTERSON? WHY, I WANT A DIVORCE, MR. PATTERSON, BECAUSE I WANT A DIVORCE. I DON'T WANT TO BE MARRIED TO YOU. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A GOOD HUSBAND. HMM. ALL THAT TALK WITH HELEN- THAT'S THE DOPE, AIN'T IT? ALL THAT TALK ABOU LITTLE GARDENS OR WHATEVER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE WRONG. I DON'T WAN LITTLE GARDENS, EITHER. I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE DOWN - NOT A NICKEL'S WORTH. YOU AGREE WITH ME THA MARRIAGE IS THE BUNK, HUH? THERE AIN'T NOTHING BETWEEN A MAN AND A TOMATO- UH, A WOMAN - BUT LIKE A TIME AT RENO. BUT TO SETTLE DOWN? THAT AIN'T IT, IS IT? MY OLD FRIEND "IT." LET'S PUT I THIS WAY, HARRY: I'M NO MORE LIKE HELEN... NO MORE LIKE HER THAN... THAN... THAN THE GIRL ON YOUR ARM. HEY, YOU AIN'T JEALOUS OF HER, ARE YOU? NO, DEAR. COULD BE A LITTLE, PAL... ESPECIALLY A GIRL A GUY CARRIES AROUND WITH HIM. I WOULDN'T LIKE A GUY PAINTED ON YOU STARING AT ME, NEITHER. WOULDN'T YOU, HARRY? NO, I WOULDN'T. HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS- SUPPOSE I STICK YOU ON THE OTHER ARM? NO, THANK YOU, DARLING. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU WOULDN' BE ASHAMED OF THIS GIRL NONE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M PROTECTING HER ABOUT. SHE DON'T NEED IT. I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T. AND, HARRY, I'M NO A BIT INTERESTED. THIS GIRL WAS GOOD. SHE LIVED ON THE SHORES OF NORMANDY BEFORE THE WAR. I LOOKED GOOD TO HER BECAUSE SHE LIVED NOWHERE NEAR ANYBODY WORTH KNOWING. I COULDN'T HELP LOOKING GOOD TO HER. THEN COME A TIME WHEN I'D BETTER GET OUT OF THERE, SEE? BUT GET THIS STRAIGHT- I MISSED HER MORE THAN SHE DID ME. SHE WAS ONE LOVELY GIRL. I'D BET ON THAT. WHAT DID SHE SAY WHEN YOU SAID GOOD-BYE? I DIDN'T SAY GOOD-BYE. SHE WAS ASLEEP. DID SHE SEE THIS? NOPE. SORRY. WELL... I LIKE YOUR FRENCH LADY. AND I REPEAT- I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH LITTLE HOUSES AND LITTLE GARDENS. LITTLE GARDENS DON'T MEAN ONE THING OR ANOTHER. I DON'T MEAN THAT I'M AFRAID OF THE SEA, EITHER. WE COULD HAVE ALL THE 7 SEAS BETWEEN US. IT COULD STILL BE PERFECT. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS... WE DIDN'T BRING RENO BACK WITH US. RENO'S STILL IN RENO, AND RENO SHOULD GROW IN A GARDEN. GET ME? SURE, I GET YOU. AND, SAY... I WOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU AND ME ARE A LO ALIKE, DO YOU KNOW IT? AND HOW ABOUT THIS- YOU GET A DIVORCE, AND THEN WHEN I LAND AGAIN, IF YOU FEEL BETTER ABOU IT, WE'LL GET MARRIED AGAIN. RIGHT TO LEFT, LEFT TO RIGHT... OK, PAL, OK. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WE'RE DIVORCED, DEAR. OH... BUT NOT OFFICIALLY. WE WEREN'T MARRIED OFFICIALLY, EITHER. OK, PAL, OK. NOW HOW ABOUT FINDING THE BOYS? NO, THANKS. PARTY'S OVER, HUH? IT WAS A NICE ONE. MM-MMM. WELL, SHE DOES MOVE, DON'T SHE? I TOLD YOU ON THE STAIRS, IT CAN HAPPEN FAST. OK, DARLING, OK. AND IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, I'LL BE HANGING AROUND THE SAME JOINT, PROBABLY, AND I HOPE YOU CHANGE IT, PAL. THANKS, HARRY. IF I DO, I'LL LOOK YOU UP, PAL. OK, PAL. SO LONG. SO LONG. DO I GET A KISS? SURE. OK. SO LONG. SO LONG. YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL. HI, GUS! - HEY, HARRY! WHAT SHIP WE WORKING? IT'S A LUCKY THING YOU SHOWED UP! THEY GOT MUDGIN ON THE CARPET IN THERE. WHAT FOR? HE WON'T SAIL WITHOUT HIS SOUL. YEAH, AND THEY'RE GONNA TAKE HIS BOOK AWAY. YEAH? AND ANOTHER THING... SHOW ME THE LAW OF THE MARITIME UNION OR THE SHIPPING COMMISSION THAT SAYS YOU CAN TAKE A MAN'S BOOK AWAY FOR LOSING HIS SOUL. WHAT SOUL? MY WEEPIN', IMMORTAL SOUL THAT I HAVE TO HAVE TO GO TO HEAVEN IF I DIE. WE'VE ARGUED LONG ENOUGH. NOW, SHIP ON THE PACIFIC BELLE, OR LOSE YOUR BOOK. YOU AIN'T GOT A RIGHT TO PASS JUDGMENT ON A THING LIKE THIS. OH, I AIN'T, HUH? NO, YOU AIN'T, MISTER. YOU AIN'T BIG ENOUGH. THE MARITIME UNION AIN'T BIG ENOUGH. THAT'S ALL, BROTHER. YOU'RE BEACHED FOR GOOD! OH, NO, YOU CAN'T! HOLD IT, MUDGE. HARRY! YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. PAUL REVERE PATTERSON. HIYA, PALS. OK, BUT THIS LITTLE CHARACTER-WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? ON A MISSION OF MERCY IN RENO. LOOK, PATTERSON, WE'VE LISTED YOUR CREW FOR THIS TRIP. THEY'VE ALL CHECKED IN OK BUT THIS SCREWBALL. HE'LL CHECK IN. WHEN'S SHE SAIL? BE ABOARD FRIDAY MORNING. WHAT ARE WE ARGUING ABOUT? IF WE SAIL, WE SAIL. I'LL GUARANTEE MUDGE. GIVE HIM BACK HIS BOOK. OK, THERE YOU ARE. MUCH THANKS, STEVE. COME ON, MUDGE. I DON'T KNOW, HARRY. A MAN IN MY CONDITION- TAKE IT EASY. I'LL GIVE YOU A CERTIFICATE OF LOSS FOR THE THING. WORSE GUYS THAN YOU HAVE SKIMMED PAST THE PEARLY GATES. DID YOU GET HIM OFF, HARRY? SURE, SURE. WHERE YOU REALLY BEEN, HARRY? I COULDN'T FIND YOU NOPLACE. I WAS MARRIED - MARRIED AND DIVORCED. RENO, RENO. WHO WAS SHE, HARRY? A FRIEND OF MUDGIN- PSYCHONEUROSIS. MISS EMILY? YEAH. YEAH, EMILY. I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER. YOU DID THA TO MISS EMILY? PATTERSON... MARRIED? LET'S HAVE A DRINK, MUDGE, ON ME. A DRINK? NO, NOT NOW. I GOT AN ERRAND TO DO. WHEW... DID I STOP ONE! 'TWAS A DIRTY FIGHT? NO, IT WAS STRIC MERCHANT MARINE RULES. I'M ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATING HIM. DON'T YOU REALLY MEAN THAT YOU OVERESTIMATED ME? OH, NO, MISS EMILY. I BET YOU DONE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE COULD'VE DONE. I CLAIM A DRAW. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY A GIRL CAN'T EVER WIN. ALL SHE CAN DO IS HOLD DOWN THE SCORE. I GOT TO TAKE THE BLAME FOR THIS. OH, NO. WE WERE BOTH OVERCONFIDENT... BUT YOU CAN QUOTE ME- A VERY CHARMING MAN. OH, THE TRICKY, TWISTY WAYS OF HIM. WHEN I BRUNG HIM INTO THE LIBRARY, I KNOWED FROM THE VERY FIRS IT WAS YOU HE'D BE AFTER. SO DID I. BUT THE CHARM OF THE SCAMP-YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT. OH, YES. NOT LIKE ME, WHO'S FOLLOWED HIM THESE MANY YEARS. I'VE CURSED HIM FOR PICKING FIGHTS, THEN GONE AFTER HIM INTO THE BRAWL HE STARTED. I'VE EVEN DEFENDED HIM TO WOMEN USING MY NATIVE ELOQUENCE. WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM? HE'LL MISS YOU, I SAY. HE'LL GRIEVE FOR YOU AND COME BACK A BETTER MAN. BE PATIENT, BE TRUE, AND WAIT FOR HIM TO GROW THE THORNY ROSE YOU PLANTED IN HIS HEART. THAT WAS LOVELY, MR. MUDGIN. IT WAS A LIE. BUT I'LL NOT LIE TO YOU, MISS EMILY. IT'S GOOD RIDDANCE YOU BROKE WITH HIM. THAT WAS BRAVE. THAT WAS STRONG. I TOLD YOU I GOT A LEAST A DRAW, DIDN'T I? YOU AIN'T BRUISED TOO BAD? NO. YOU SEE, I'M A PRETTY TOUGH MUG MYSELF. SURE, NOW, YOU ARE. YOU ARE. BUT ME... I'M SAILING WITH HIM. BULLIED ME INTO IT, HE DID! SHEER BULLYING! YOU DESERVE A BOW. A BOW? FOR SAVING THAT BLACK OCEAN, AND ME WITHOUT A SOUL? BOTH OF US ARE LOST-CASTAWAYS. HE NEEDS YOU, MR. MUDGE. KEEP THIS UNDER YOUR HAT, PAL, BUT HE ISN'T NEARLY THE CHAMPION HE THINKS HE IS. HARRY PATTERSON? I CAN SAY NO MORE. IT'S A TRADE SECRET... BUT PUT THE LAUREL WREATH ON HIS BROW AND LET HIM SWAGGER. THE GUY STILL RATES A CHEER, AND YOU CAN QUOTE ME. QUEEN DEIRDRE HERSELF. SHAKE. GOOD-BYE, MR. MUDGE. HI. HELEN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME? I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO TELL YOU THAT I FORGOT. I GIVE UP... SO I'LL TELL THE TRUTH. I LEFT A LO OF WORRY HERE. OH, DEAR HELEN. HEY, YOU SOUND FINE. EM, ARE YOU PACKING TO GO AWAY WITH HIM HIS LAST FEW DAYS? NO. WE PARTED... GAY AS TWO LARKS. IF YOU'RE SORRY FOR ME, YOU'LL BE SORRY... BUT YOU CAN HAVE THE HARBOR TILL HE'S GONE. I'LL BE BACK IN TWO DAYS... TELL YOU ABOUT A DAYDREAM I HAD IN THE LIBRARY. THANK YOU. HI, EM! COME DOWN HERE. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT ARE YOU PAINTING MY HOUSE FOR? HA! IT NEEDS IT, DON'T IT? WHAT ARE YOU PAINTING IT FOR? JUST A GOING-AWAY PRESENT, THAT'S ALL. I GUESS I THOUGH IT WOULD PLEASE YOU. THOUGHT YOU'D LEAVE A LITTLE MONEY IN MY SHOES. NOW, LOOK. THAT'S THE LAST WAY TO LOOK AT IT, EMILY. I SEE HOW IT WOULD MAKE YOU SORE, NATURALLY, BUT IT AIN' LIKE THAT. WHEN I SAID A PRESENT, I MEANT LIKE A PRESEN TO RENO FROM BOTH OF US. USUALLY YOU PAINT THE TOWN GOOD THE LAST DAY, IN MY TRADE. BUT I THOUGHT, JUS TO SHOW YOU THAT RENO WAS THE BEST TIME I EVER HAD ASHORE, I'D PAINT YOUR HOUSE INSTEAD. WELL... THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU, HARRY, OF COURSE. NOW WE CAN SAY GOOD-BYE AGAIN. AS YOU SAID, WE'RE ALWAYS SAYING GOOD-BYE. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO FINISH IT? NO, HARRY, THANKS. WHY? BECAUSE... BECAUSE I SAY SO! OK. OK! OH, FINE, YOU DECIDED TO PAINT THE HOUSE. IT LOOKS GREAT. I TAKE IT YOU'RE MISS SEARS. I'M MR. LITTLETON.

I GUESS IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS SAVING UP. NOW IT'S SAID. DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT BACK? NOT ONE WORD. TAKE IT BACK. YOU AIN'T TALKING TO YOUR FRIEND, YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR BOSUN. OH, MY BOSUN, IS IT? WELL, BEIN' A SAILOR AND WITH RESPECT TO DISCIPLINE TO BOSUN PATTERSON, I TAKE IT BACK. TO MY FRIEND THAT WAS, NEVER WILL I. HA HA HA HA HA! IT WAS ALL MY IDEA, COMING TO RENO. EMILY WAS HERE ON HER HONEYMOON, AND I SAID THE WAY TO GET CURED QUICK IS TAKE A HAIR OF THE DOG THAT BIT YOU. YOU MEAN A TACK FROM THE HEEL THAT KICKED YOU. MY LAST ONE WAS JUST PLAIN RAT. HOW ABOUT YOURS, EMILY? MINE WAS A SAILOR. OH. ANNAPOLIS MAN? NO. WHAT WAS HIS RANK, DARLING? HE'S A BOSUN. GREATEST BOSUN OF THEM ALL. AND THE BIGGES HEEL. BUT WHAT'S A BOSUN, EMILY? I THINK IT'S THE NEXT RANK ABOVE ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET. HE WAS JUS A TOUGH MUG SAILOR. HE SOUNDS ROMANTIC. DON'T BELIEVE I EVER KNEW A SAILOR. OH, YOU MISSED A LOT. SHE WAS A PERFECTLY HAPPY LIBRARIAN UNTIL HE- OH, NO, HELEN, NO. I WORKED IN A MORGUE. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE DEAD RISE UP WHEN THAT SAILOR CAME IN. EVEN GABRIEL'S HORN COULDN'T PIPE HIM DOWN. HE TREATED YOU LIKE A TOMATO ON A BIG SHORE LEAVE. WHAT A SHORE LEAVE. AND THEN HE RAN OFF TO SEA! I WOULD HAVE HAD AN ADORABLE HUSBAND. ADORABLE? FOR 3 DAYS EVERY 6 MONTHS. OR ONE DAY EVERY 10 YEARS. MM-HMM. EMILY! EMILY! HEY, JOE! SHE ISN'T USED TO DRINKING. BETTER GET A DOCTOR, HELEN. IS SHE ALL RIGHT? WAS IT JUS THE BRANDY? OH, NO, NO, NO.

RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO WASH THE TEARS OFF YOUR FACE. WE'RE GOING TO THE DANCE TONIGHT. ONCE THERE WAS A WAITRESS IN THE BRIDGE DOOR HOTEL HER MASTER WAS A FINE ONE AND HER MISTRESS WAS A-SWELL ALONG CAME A SAILOR LAD FRESH FROM THE SEA AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF ALL THAT MISERY WHEN DID HE SPEAK TO YOU GUYS LAST? OUTSIDE OF GIVEN ORDERS, NOT SINCE WE LEFT SYDNEY, MORE THAN A MONTH. I AIN'T HAD A LOOK OUT OF HIM SINCE FRISCO, 6 MONTHS. 6 MONTHS AND 11 DAYS. IF YOU ASK ME, IT'S ALL HOOKED UP WITH THAT GOOFY FIGH HE AND MUDGE HAD WHEN WE LEFT FRISCO. MUDGIN GIVES ME THE CREEPS, TOO.

ONE LONG LAUGH. SHE'D THROW A KISS WITH ONE HAND AND A ROCK WITH THE OTHER. HA! THAT SCREWBALL! "OH," SHE SAYS, "YOU CHEATED THA NICE LITTLE MAN. GOOD-BYE!" JUST SCIENTIFIC, DARLING. "AND I WON' STEAL A CHICKEN! GOOD-BYE!" I LOVE YOU, DARLING. "OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MY ROOF? STOP PAINTING MY ROOF! GOOD-BYE!" SHE WAS ALWAYS SAYING GOOD-BYE TO ME FROM THE MOMEN I MET HER! HA! THAT SCREWBALL. A CHARMING, VIOLENT LADY. WELL, SE?OR... NO, NO, DON'T GO. I HAVE MY ENGAGEMENT. THE MADHOUSE IN THE HILLS? IT IS MAD, NO DOUBT, BUT PEACEFUL, AND IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE VIOLENT TO BE PEACEFUL. YEAH? MY WIFE AND I LIVE FAMILIARLY AS TWO OLD SHOES, YET WE LIVE IN CONFLICT. WE LIVE TO MAKE EACH OTHER LAUGH, AND THE CHILDREN ARE OUR AUDIENCE. WE ARE GREATER STRANGERS THAN THE DAY WE MET, AND THUS, MY FRIEND, FAMILIARITY BREEDS BEAUTY. ADIOS, SE?OR. SE?ORITA. HE'S GOOD. THE OLD BOY'S GOOD. YES, HARRY. HE'S VERY GOOD. YEAH, YOU'RE 193, AND YOU CAN PULL THAT STUFF. WHEN ARE YOU GOING BACK TO HER? HA! WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? I LEFT! I GOT LAUGHED OUT. I WASN' LAUGHING AT YOU. IT WASN'T YOU WHO WAS LAUGHING. IT'S SHE- LAUGHING AT ME. ADIOS, HARRY. HEY! MARIA, HEY! MARIA! HEY! HA HA! YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? THEY'RE ALWAYS SAYING GOOD-BYE TO ME. NICK! COME ON, WHAT'LL YOU HAVE, EVERYBODY? IT'S LIKE I SAY, RED- A GUY CAN FORGE ANYTHING. A BIG, STRONG GUY LIKE YOU? SIMPLE. TIME DOES IT. TIME AND DISTANCE. DON'T I KNOW. AIN'T I TOLD YOU, HARRY? SURE. I'LL BET YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE GUY'S FACE OR NOTHIN' HE EVER SAID. RIGHT? RIGHT. HE WAS A SOFT-TALKING HEEL FROM ALABAMA WITH A DIMPLE IN HIS CHIN, AND I FORGOT HIM LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE THAT. AND YOU AIN' A SAILOR. A SAILOR'S GOT PLENTY OF OCEAN- 10,000 MILES OF THE STUFF. AND TIME, THAT DOES IT. TIME. GOOD OLD TIME. GOD BLESS TIME, I SAY. IT'S BETTER THAN BOOZE OR DOPE. THE DOCS AIN'T GO NOTHING COMPARED TO WHA A FEW MONTHS WILL DO. OR YEARS. SOMETIMES YOU NEED YEARS. NOT ME. THAT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE FORGETTING. I DON'T WISH TO APPEAR DOGMATIC, MY DEAR HARRY, BUT IT DOES DEPEND ON WHO YOU FORGET. THERE AIN'T A DAME ON EARTH I CAN'T FORGET IN 6 MONTHS. OK, OK. YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH A DAME, AND SHE WANTS TO PLAN TREES IN YOUR HEART. TO SHADE A POTATO PATCH THA SHE'LL WATER WITH YOUR BLOOD. HARRY... HARRY, MUDGIN'S HURT. HE FELL OFF THE SHIP. OK, THROW HIM BACK AGAIN. BUT, HARRY, HE'S LAYIN' ON THE DOCK WITH HIS WHOLE SIDE CAVED IN! TELL THE CAPTAIN I DON' FALL FOR THAT STUFF. TELL HIM MUDGIN AND I PARTED COMPANY. HARRY, CAPTAIN WAS SAILING WITHOUT YOU, BUT NOT MUDGIN. HE JUMPED SHIP TO FIND YOU. I AIN'T SEEN MUDGIN SO CRAZY SINCE HE LOST HIS SOUL! THIS BETTER BE ON THE LEVEL. HERE, PAL, 20 BUCKS. WHAT FOR? GOOD CONVERSATION. OK, BOYS, TAKE HIM ABOARD. HOW IS HE, DOC? STOP JARRIN' HIM. 'COURSE... IRELAND IS... AND ME WASH SPITOONS FOR SEAN AGAIN. THE SEA... SHIPS... GOOD-BYE, DARLIN'. LOOK OUT! TORPEDO, TORPEDO! OK, MUDGE, OK. LAY STILL AND REST. OH, IT'S YOU, HARRY. YEAH. HERE, WANT SOME WATER? WHERE'S THE SKY? AND THE WIND BLOWIN'? WE'RE ON THE SHIP, MUDGE. BOUND FOR FRISCO. FRISCO? THEN I'LL GO ON DECK NOW. NO, NO, NO. TAKE IT EASY. BUT A MAN MUSTN' DIE IN THIS RATHOLE. YOU AIN'T GONNA DIE. INDEED, NOW? LET'S TAKE HIM ON DECK, HARRY. COULDN'T MAKE HIM NO WORSE. YEAH, IF WE DONE IT CAREFUL. OK. OK. THE SKY... THE WIND... MUDGE, WE'RE OUT OF THE RATHOLE. I KNOW IT. WELL, TAKE A LOOK. I'M SCARED TO... AND ASHAMED. NOTHING TO FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT. THE FOG- THE FOG'S CLOSIN' IN, AND I AIN'T GO MY SOUL- MY WEEPIN' IMMORTAL SOUL. YOU NEVER LOST IT, MUDGE. YES, I DID. ON POWELL STREET. A TINY LIGHT, A LITTLE STAR. I'M IN THE DARK NOW. ALL BY MYSELF, AND NOT EVEN A MATCH TO STRIKE ON MY BRITCHES. A DISGRACE TO IRELAND. AYE... DID YOU FEEL IT, HARRY? DID IT TOUCH YOU? SURE, MUDGE, SURE. TELL ME SOMETHING- MY SOUL, HE GIVE I BACK TO ME. THAT'S RIGHT, MUDGE. NEAR ENOUGH. AIN'T YOU GO UP THERE YET? OH, YOU STILL LOOSE? NOTHING EVER CHANGES. WELL, I GUESS I'LL TAKE A CHANCE. BROTHER, YOU'RE DUE. I'LL HANG AROUND A FEW MINUTES, IN CASE YOU COME OUT ON YOUR EAR. OK. HI, HELEN. EMILY! HI, PAL. EM! EM! WHERE IS SHE? SHE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. WHERE DOES SHE LIVE? WHY? HEY, WHAT'S EATING YOU? WHAT KIND OF A GREETING IS THIS? GREET YOU? I GREET YOU? I COULD CUT YOUR THROAT, YOU RAT! AND I COULD CUT MINE, TOO! THAT MORNING FROM RENO IN THERE- THAT DAY OF THE BIG CELEBRATION AND ALL THAT STUFF I PULLED ABOUT- ABOUT BEING SO HAPPY BECAUSE YOU MADE HER FEEL SO HAPPY! OH, BOY, ALL THOSE WORDS CAME BACK AND BIT ME! WHAT'S THE MATTER, HELEN? EMILY AND I PARTED THE BEST PALS GOING. SHE DON'T KNOW YOU'RE ALIVE! SHE'D DIVORCED. SHE'S RID OF YOU. SHE'S ALL RIGHT, AND YOU LEAVE HER ALONE. YOU LEAVE HER ALONE! THERE'S MY CAB. WHERE YOU GOING? WHERE YOU GOING? GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE. WHERE YOU GOING? HEY-HEY, I THOUGH THAT OTHER DAME- HURRY, DRIVER, HURRY. HEY, WHAT IS? YOU TELL ME WHERE EMILY IS, AND I'M NOT KIDDIN'. I'LL TELL YOU. SHE'S HAVING A BABY! HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? A BABY? YEAH, A BABY. EVER HEARD OF THEM? WELL, THIS IS IT! WHAT'S THE IDEA OF HER HAVING A BABY, AND ME NOT KNOWING IT? IF I'M A FATHER, I'M A FATHER. WHERE IS SHE? WE'RE GOING THERE. THE FARM. WELL, YOU WAI TILL I GET THERE. COME ON, STEP ON IT! GET GOING! YES, FATHER. I'M GOING TO TOWN. STICK AROUND. YEAH, HE WON'T BE WITH US LONG. THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS LEAVE HER ALONE NOW. YEAH?

IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED YESTERDAY. WELL, WHAT'S THE IDEA? WHY AIN'T YOU IN A HOSPITAL, WHERE YOU BELONG? THIS AIN'T NO SETUP. A FARM, A HICK DOCTOR. YOU KNOW WHO'LL TAKE THE RAP IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG? ME. SUCH CONCERN, HARRY- I'M OVERCOME. BUT I WAS BORN IN THIS BED, AND DR. ASHLON WAS MY DOCTOR. I SEE. DR. ASHLON WAS YOUR DOCTOR, NOW HE'S MY DOCTOR. AN OLD MAN TRIPPING ON HIS BEARD. NOT A CHANCE. ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME? HMM? JUST AS FRESH AS EVER. A DAME'S GONNA HAVE A BABY, SHE USUALLY WRITES A GUY, DON'T SHE? SOMETIMES A GIRL... GETS WRITER'S CRAMP, HARRY. YEAH? WELL, IT WASN' THOUGHTFUL OF YOU. HA! I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT I WOULD BE LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HOW IS IT? OH, IT'S JUST... GAY. WHAT'S THAT MEAN? IT DOESN'T HURT. NOT TO BE HUR HURTS MORE. I GUESS I DON' GET YOU. THAT BIG TREE.

WILL YOU MARRY ME, HARRY? SURE THING, ANYTIME! RIGHT TO LEFT, LEFT TO RIGHT. YOU WOULDN'T MARRY ME IF I ASKED YOU TO. OH, PROBABLY WOULD. I WAS ALONE FOR A LONG WHILE BEFORE YOU CAME ALONG, AND I'VE BEEN ALONE FOR A LONGER WHILE SINCE YOU LEFT. I KNOW THERE'LL NEVER BE ANOTHER MAN UNDER A TREE FOR ME. FUNNY, ALL THAT TALK OF TREES AND LIBRARIES. THERE SHOULD BE A REAL TREE, FOR A MINUTE. WELL, PAL, I'LL HAND YOU ONE. I'LL NEVER KISS ANOTHER GIRL UNDER A TREE, EITHER. WE JUST MISSED, DIDN'T WE? HOW LONG YOU STAYING THIS TIME, HARRY? OH, I GOT A COUPLE OF WEEKS, WITH LUCK. GOOD. HOW ARE THE BOYS? OH, AND HARRY, HOW'S MY MUDGIN? HE'S OK. HE, UH, FOUND HIS SOUL. OH? IT HAD WINGS ON HIM.
