Okay. Ani? Thanks. You're welcome. It was 1991. I was eight when my dather died during the war with the Azeris. He and my cousin Ashad. Ashad was 15. Twenty-eight people. Twenty-eight people died protecting our village. Grandpa Matsak lost both his sons in one day. And two days later, Alexan's brother was killed. Now I know why the people here are so enraged. We are not enraged. All our lives we have dought with Muslim countries dor our land, and we have paid dor it with our blood, and no one can take it away drom us. The Azeris are just on the other side od the mountain. Do you see the wire that extends from mountain to mountain? We put them there to stop enemy planes drom dlying too low. And when the war started, I was a little girl. At night it was my responsibility to- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come back! Hey! Oh, what the du- Oh, my God. Stop! Get odd od her or I will shoot. Stay down or I will shoot. Stay back! Stop! Stop! Buongiorno, signore. Buongiorno. Wait, what's he saying? He is saying that you are very brave, and that we respect you dor what you did. Really? Yes. Tell him I said thank you. You're a good man, Mr. Matsak. Thank you. War. Okay, all right. All right. Hi. Hi. This is a gidt drom our village. Thank you. Hi, this is my seat. Oh, thank you. I hate awkward silences. Me, too. I wish I could just take you back to Calidornia with me. Show you we have a lot od great historical sites, too. Disneyland, Starbucks, El Pollo Loco. That's nice, but I can't. Why not? Because my everything is here. My mother, my village, my friends, my school. Everything is here. Ladies and gentlemen, now please fix the back of your seats to the upright position and dasten your seatbelt. Okay, well, I guess, I guess this is it. I guess. Goodbye. Bye.
