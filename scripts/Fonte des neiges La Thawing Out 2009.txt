Hey, you take me for a moron? Excuse me? If I say I'm cold Then I'm cold! I have no desire to spend my holidays in a zoo. In a zoo -- a zoo! Now I've heard everything! You are Caroline, right? Hello. Your voice is even more unsettling than on the phone. It's been 20 years since I last came. - Still have the pink bridge? - Oh no, it was destroyed. Really? But there's still miniature golf. - You came here alone? - Yes. Actually, no, I am with my son. Hello young man! What's your name? - Leo. - Leo? - Really? We have the same name! - He's a bit shy. You'll find lots of children your age here. - I'm not interested. - Not Interested? - You prefer the adults? - No, I prefer nobody. Well, you can set up anywhere you want. It's end-of-season. Above all, don't help me! Eh? Why are you looking at me like that? Ah! Let me go! - Stop! Stop! - Let yourself go! - Stop! - Help! - Help! Help! - Stop! "Mom, I'm fine" ... "Why does it seem like I'm not?" "It's just that I feel like I've swallowed a freezer! " "Yeah, I have chills" "shivers and goose bumps" "It's funny but I feel I have shrunk ... " "to become my mother's poodle..." "...who will never have his own life " Mama? Hi, so you're Leo? No. You hide? Are you not beautiful? It's because my body makes Oh! You're a stalactite then? Will you come play with us? No, I am too old for those games. And I do not like children ... Mama? "...what does it mean, to love?" "It is a tune that we cherish" "When we're on the same melody ..." "... no errant notes in our chords,..." "no refrains that become bores." "... that likes what we love,"" "if you pretend to be there... " "... if you think I do not see ..." "... you catch your fingers in excitement " ...in excitement... in excitement... ( Hello? Yes. ) ( Roland should handle that. ) She is beautiful, your mother! No, she's horrible, like an animal. Do you have eye problems? - How old are you? - 12. I'm Antoinette. Happy to meet me? If you eat a mushroom like this... you won't be yourself for hours. Real life will seem unreal, as in a dream that never ends, and you'll fear nothing. Already I'm turning into someone else. A Polish, or Spanish.... or even an African ancestor! with parents who love me like crazy. Now we should sit down, or we might fall. And you need to take away your scarf, I would not want you to die by strangulation. Wait, I'll do it. It's for your circulation. - Do you ... eat some every day? No, no, not every day. It's too powerful. What does it take, to love? it is a kiss, in a caress... at blush of dawn. Meet me tomorrow. The adults will be on a walk. Excuse me, I have to go. My son is waiting for me. We only have to get up early. Your son will be sleeping. We can watch the sun rise, where the pink bridge used to be. I leave you my crown. Orange. Tomato. Apple. Whoa! Very sexy! I adore it! No... I know I look like a worm and I'm horrible. "Horrible! Horrible!" Is that your favorite word in life? I'll tell you a secret: I am very much like you. I also feel like body's 15 below. Since I was little. Close your eyes now. Close! You can open them. one two three - Your counting? - four five six - seven - You're beautiful! Kiss me. What does it take... a kiss in a caress... blush of dawn... no errant notes in our chords, no refrains that become bores... What does it take, to love? At a glance that it runs ... a lala lala lala. Good Evening, Leo. Good evening, Sir. Flooded! Did you see? My heart beats very hard and very fast! It's normal when you're in a secondary state! This is the first time I've gone out with a boy. - Drugs are insane! Insane! - It's only the beginning! Oh! Look! There's your mother there! Mama! Mama! Oh! Wait! It is not possible! I am so ashamed. But no. It's magic. Close your eyes! Go ahead, shut them! You can open them now. I feel so much better surrounded by fabric. Without you I would never have dared. Me either. Without you I would never have dared. In reality, I don't like being nude. I just do it to please my parents. Thanks to you ... It is love. But what's wrong? Are you 'coming down'? I didn't know you liked to cook. Let's see ... Hum! very good! You're a great cook my darling. And where'd you get these delicious mushrooms? - You're not going to eat? - I'm not very hungry. - You're girlfriend is very attractive. - She is not my girlfriend. Do you feel hot? Not particularly. Doesn't your heart beat very hard and very fast? Not really, no. But you are behaving oddly, aren't you? It's just you making me laugh. You should see your face! Leo! Putting.... Putting your ogre's hands on my breasts! Go Leo, put your hands ... But you're crazy,right? What are you doing there? I don't know me. Mama! Mama! What? Do you feel like yourself? But, I'm sleeping now! But isn't your heart beating very strong and very fast? You're completely obsessed with that! No. I think I poisoned my mother! With that there is not much chance. Then a person stays herself... even if she eats it several days? She really feels what she feels, she really thinks what she thinks? The only risk is a stomach ache. My mother dreams of you! I am myself! I am myself! We are ourselves! This isn't the mushrooms! This isn't the mushrooms! This isn't the mushrooms! Mama! Mama! Wake up! Do you know what time it is? We must leave immediately! But no, we leave this afternoon. Mom, I must tell you something very important. What's the matter? I am bewitched! I am obliged to leave. Shall we write? Want to tell her goodbye? Keep going! Keep going! "Mama, I'm fine." "Why?" "Do I not seem well?" "Well, I'm fine!" "Yes, I'm fine!" "Really great!" What does it take, to love? It is a kiss, in a caress, at blush of dawn That's what it takes, to love. It is a tune that we cherish when we are on the same melody no errant notes in our chords and no refrains that become bores. What does it take, to love? It is a journey we both go through while never leaving from the port Where the horizon never ends. That's what it takes, to love. That's what it takes, to love.
