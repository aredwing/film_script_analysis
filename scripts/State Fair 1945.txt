Your supper will be here any minute. I wish I knew what was keeping that feller. Our state fair is a great state fair Don't miss it Don't even be late It's dollars to doughnuts that our state fair Is the best state fair in our state Dad! Daddy, I just had Mr. Cramer on the phone. He said Dave Miller stopped by his place 10 minutes ago - to put water in his radiator. - Thanks, daughter. Margy? - Have you finished your packing? - Not yet. I was just going to. I don't know what's got into you lately. All you do is sit around and mope. I don't sit around and mope. Well, stop moping now and finish your packing. Always saying she doesn't know what's got into me. I'll be glad to get to the fair, hear something different, see something different for a change. What has got into me, anyway? The things I used to like I don't like anymore I want a lot of other things I've never had before It's just like Mother says I sit around and mope Pretending I am wonderful And knowing I'm a dope - Margy? - Yes, Mother? As soon as you're finished, I want you to come down and help me with the pickles. In a minute, Mother. Pickles! I'm as restless as a willow In a windstorm I'm as jumpy as a puppet On a string I'd say that I had spring fever But I know it isn't spring I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented Like a nightingale without a song to sing Oh, why should I have spring fever When it isn't even spring I keep wishing I were somewhere else Walking down a strange, new street Hearing words that I have never heard From a man I've yet to meet I'm as busy as a spider Spinning daydreams I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud Ora robin on the wing But I feel so gay In a melancholy way That it might as well be spring It might as well be Spring Margy! I'm coming, Mother. Come on, boy. Ah, he'll win first this year sure. He's half again the hog he was last year. You don't really expect to win, do you, with that animated lard can? Say, listen, you can say anything you please about me, but don't say anything bad about Blue Boy. That's the finest Hampshire boar that ever breathed. If you think that, he's just as good as beat now. Be better if he was third or fourth best. - He'd stand a better chance. - What are you talking about? If a hog or a man ever got what he was entitled to just once, the eternal stars would quit making melody in the spheres. Oh, there you go with that book talk again. I say he's the best hog in the state, and the judges will say so too. They might. But if that turns out good, then something else will probably happen. - He might catch pneumonia... - Oh! or hog cholera, or you might catch pneumonia. Or something might happen to Wayne or Margy. Oh! Mark my words, Abel, there's compensation in this world. For every good, there's bad. Now, Ralph Waldo Emerson tells us... I don't care what Waldo Emerson tells us! Look, I'll just make a little bet with you. - On what? - I'll bet you we go to the fair... and Blue Boy will win the grand award. And nothing bad will happen to him, me or my family. Yes, and we'll all have a good time too and be better off for it after the fair is over. It's a foolish bet, Abel. If you'd asked me, I'd have given you 10-to-1. But you didn't ask me, so it's an even bet. - Five dollars? - Five dollars is right. I'll be around for the money the day you get back. - Be around with the money, you mean. - You'll see. You'll see. Yeah, I'll see. Well, well, what's this? You got your chains on. You expecting a shower? Nope. I'm expecting good weather. That's why I put my chains on, so I wouldn't be fooled. Do you want your name "Mrs. Abel Frake" or "Mrs. Melissa Frake"? Melissa Frake, I guess. With your father entering Blue Boy, the judges might get us mixed. Hog cholera, pneumonia. He left out earthquakes, the old gloom spreader. Poor Dad. Mmm, I don't know. Let me taste. - Don't taste like Grandma Stidger's. - I followed her recipe. - I'll get it. - You left something out. Abel Frake, I am not gonna put liquor into my cooking! Making mincemeat without brandy? No such thing. I don't approve of it, and I won't do it. Well, you'll be sorry. You know, those judges at the fair, they like a little snifter now and then. - It's Eleanor, for Wayne. - Wayne's out back somewhere. I'll find him. Why don't you say hello to Eleanor, Ma? See how her mother is. You know, they had the doctor again this morning. - I suppose I should. - Find out if she's going to the fair. Yes, I will. Hello, Eleanor. How are you, dear? How's your mother feeling? Yes, I know. I'm sorry I couldn't get by to see her today, but I've been so busy getting ready to leave and all. Oh, well, I'm glad she's better, dear. Wayne'll be here any moment. Just hold on. And be sure to give my love to your mother. Thank you, dear. Good-bye. - Abel? - Hmm? I need a good-sized box, or cotton. Something to carry my pickles in. Know just what you want, Ma. I'll get it for you right away. "Stir in apples and molasses, spices, lemons..." "Two parts good brandy." No, I won't! - Eph, where's Wayne? - Wayne? He's back there in the barn. Thank you, mister. And now, I think I'll have a try at that fancy brass clock. Yes, that one. - There ya are. - Wayne? There's a nice string of pearls. I think I'll have a go at them. - Oh, I know they're fakes, but... - Wayne! What are you doing? - How long you been there? - Just a little while. Why didn't you say somethin' instead of just standing there? Who were you talking to? And does Mother know you have her embroidery hoops out here? Look, just leave me alone, will ya? And stop prying in other people's affairs. Speaking of affairs, Eleanor's on the phone. Eleanor? Well, Christmas! Why didn't you tell me? Eleanor's on the phone. Hello, Eleanor? Hi, honey. What'd the doctor say about your mother? Can you go? Well, I don't know what to do, Wayne. The doctor said she's a little better, but... Oh, but, Eleanor, you've got to go! I've made a lot of plans for us. What? I keep wishing I were somewhere else Walking down a strange, new street Hearing words that I have never heard From a man I've yet to meet He would be a kind of handsome combination Of Ronald Colman Charles Boyer And Bing Margy. My dear, little Margy. I'd make the world a ruby for your little finger and say, "I love you. I love you. I love you." Ah, Margy. You are beautiful. You are so very beautiful. And we feel so gay In a melancholy way That it might as well be spring Margy! - Hello, Margy. - Hello, Harry. No, I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed. Well, I'll see you when I get back. Good-bye. Gee, I wish I was going to the fair with you tonight. I'd rather be doing that than anything I know. - Oh, would you, Harry? - Well, sure. - Only I can't neglect my cows. - Oh. Of course not. - Say, I saw something today. - What? The sweetest bit of farmland this side of Davenport. I was thinking of puttin' a bid in on it if you like it. - If I like it? - Well, sure. You know I haven't made a plan since I was 12 years old that didn't include you. - Got a house on it? - Yeah, but it's too old. - We'd have to build a new one. - Oh, I like old houses. It wouldn't fit in with our kind of farm. You know, I plan to do everything my old man won't let me do on his place. Scientific irrigation, electric milking, separate hen roosts. No horses. All tractor power. - You see what I mean? Everything modern. - But the house you live in... It's gotta be the same. No clapboard and shingle business. There's a new kind of plastic, prefabricated job. I want you to see it. Got the catalog at home. - Is it pretty? - Sure! But what's more important, it's termite-proof. Wait till you see it. And they tell you how to furnish it too. No rugs or carpets. They're just dust collectors. - What's on the floor? - Linoleum through the whole house. Wait till you see the pictures. It's slick and smooth and easy to keep clean. Well, it's like every room in the house was a bathroom. - Sounds real cozy. - Yeah, don't it, though? - What I've always wanted. - Oh, sure. It's the only way to live. - Everything's sanitary. - Sure. - And if we had children... - Oh, Margy! I said if by any strange chance we had children, why, I could dress them in cellophane rompers. Say, I didn't know they had... Life will just be ducky... In our air-conditioned patent-leather farmhouse Plastic. On our ultramodern scientific farm We'll live in a streamlined heaven And we'll waste no time on charm No geraniums to clutter our veranda Nor a single, little sentimental thing No Virginia creepers Nothing useless - What's the matter, honey? - Oh, nothing. Just restless, I guess. Sure. I understand. You like to travel. Well, I figured we'd make a little trip, California or Bermuda or... if it was May, we could go to Washington, see the cherry trees. - A honeymoon? - That's what. I'd almost marry you to make the trip, Harry. No kiddin' now, Margy. What do you say? What do you say? Well, I won't say anything just now, Harry. - Well, after the fair, maybe? - Maybe. Wow! Look at him, Marge! Holy cow! Gets bigger every time I see him. Biggest boar in the world, I bet. All depends on how you spell it. Eleanor can't go. - Where's your mincemeat, Ma? - Right here between my feet. - Is the top on tight? - Certainly, it's on tight. - Why? - Oh, nothin'. Just don't want the flavor to escape, that's all. - Hello, Miss Frake! - Hello, there! - How are you? - Just fine. We'll come see you as soon as we get settled. Yes, do that. If Wayne doesn't come back soon to take me around, I'm going by myself. I do wish your father would come to his breakfast. If he'd rather stay with Blue Boy than eat, well, let him. But I've got my whole day planned out. Don't you know you can't plan out a whole day? - There's no such thing. - I do it all the time. You sound just like Harry. He thinks you can plan out your whole life. So you can. Is that what he was talking about yesterday? Uh-huh. Did you come to anything definite? Uh-uh. I don't know what you're waiting for. It would serve you right if Harry up and married that Skidmore girl instead of you. I almost hope he does. Me too. Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Move in a little closer. Don't be afraid. Hurry, hurry! Play the game! Three rings for a dime. Prizes worth up to $20. Positively no blanks. The prize you win is the prize you get, the prize you take away. Don't any gentleman want to try his skill? Ain't nobody here got the pioneer spirit? I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm goin' to put down three nice, new, crisp one-dollar bills. One here, one here, and one here. Now, who will spend a dime for three chances at $3.00? Is that real money? If you win 'em and you don't like 'em, buddy, I'll give you a dollar apiece for 'em. Hey, mister, them hoops look mighty small. - Do they fit over those things? - Lots of people do it, sir. - Lots of people do it. - Yeah, I did it last year. Remember me? I won a pearl-handled revolver. Well, now, there. You see? Young Mr. Daniel Boone here won a revolver off me right at this very fair a year ago. Bring down any grizzly bears with that shootin' iron, sonny? Tell you what I'll do with you. I'll just give you three rings on the house to start things off. Three chances for nothing. I can't win. I can only lose. But I love the game. Remember, young man, you're enjoying the courtesy of the house. Don't cost us money. I just lost $2.00! But I'm having fun. I love the game. Here, my boy. I want you to have a fair shake. That ring looks warped. Try this one. This one's all right. Well, well, you all see how easy it is. - Who else wants to try? - I'll try again. Here's a dime. - Who else wants a chance at a big prize? - Here, mister, here's my dime. How about you, sir? You look like you've got a good aim. - Why, you got a customer. - Give me three rings. Here's my dime. He's trying to dodge the boy! - All right, buddy. Here ya are. - You didn't put any dollar bills back. Ain't pearl necklaces and safety razors good enough for ya? Can't you enjoy the game for the game's sake? Are ya money mad? Those prizes are all fakes, but I'll win 'em anyway just to prove it. Quite a character. Step up, folks. We're havin' fun here. Just lost a pearl necklace, but I'm laughing. I love the game. Why, the young man is winnin' a fortune. - Here you are, buddy. - Look, pot metal molded in one piece. What good's a vanity case it won't even open? Okay, fella, you had your fun. Now, come on. Move along. And those clocks, they don't have any works. What good are they? Listen, kid, you know what I'm payin' for this pitch? - No. What? - More dough than you'll ever see. So you spend a dime, take $3.00 in cash and then try to tell the public my prizes are no good! Well, they aren't. They're just a lot of junk. Look, you, I've been nice just long enough. - Now, beat it, or I'll call a policeman. - Why don't you? - What's that? - I said, why don't you call a policeman? He's only trying to bluff you. The law says he's got to sell you all the rings you want. - Otherwise, you can close up his place. - Oh, a smart dame, huh? A law student. Now, you listen to me, Arsenic and Glamour, - I don't know who you are... - I'll tell you who I am. My father's the chief of police here. - Your father is... - The chief of police. I was standing here and saw the whole thing. Say, how did you get so good at this? It's kind of a silly thing to be good at, isn't it? But he made me sore last year. I was trying for one of those pearl-handled revolvers. It cost me about $8.00. When I finally did win it, it wasn't a revolver at all. - It wouldn't even shoot. It was just a toy. - Oh, ho! - Defrauding the public, huh? - Now, look, wait a minute. I wouldn't have minded that so much, but he kidded me in front of the crowd. - So I... - You practiced all year just to get even? That's right. I figured I'd come back and make as big a fool out of him - as he made out of me. - Oh, no, you don't. Will you give him $8.00 back if he promises to lay off? - Look, you, I don't care who your father is. - Okay. Here. Here, here. Here's your eight bucks, and you don't come back, see? - Is it a deal? - Think it's all right to take it? Well, sure, it's all right. Here you are. Good-bye. Good-bye! Oh, don't leave, folks. Prizes up to $20. - Ah! - Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! We're having fun here! Gee, it was swell of you to stand up for me like that. Thanks. Well, that's all right. He had it coming to him. Well, uh, now that you helped me get my money back, how about helping me spend it? - No, that won't be necessary. - What about a frozen custard? - No, thank you. I believe not. - Hot dog? No. Really, I have an appointment. I'm late already. Won't I see you again? How about tonight? Will you be on the midway? Tonight? Yes, I think so. I hope so. I'll sure be looking for you. - Do that. Good-bye. - Good-bye. You sure you won't change your mind? How about some popcorn? Get tickets now if you care to ride. Train's now ready to leave. Get your tickets for this ride. All aboard if you care to ride. - The train is now... - One, please. Please get tickets for this ride. It's the longest, the highest, the fastest, the safest ride at the fairground. Get tickets now if you care to ride. Hey, Pappy, there aren't any seats together. Oh. Say, mister, do you mind sitting in the seat behind? Thanks a lot. Thanks. - All aboard! - Okay. There they go! Hold your seats. They're off on a race through the clouds. A thrill a minute! Sit down! What are you trying to do, get yourself killed? I'm sorry. Haven't you ever been on one of these things before? Not since I was a little girl. - I used to be afraid of them. - But you're not now. That's what I wanted to find out. Here comes another dip. It's nearly over now. Here's the tunnel. Johnny, stop that! Everybody out, folks. Everybody out. - I'm going around again. - You gotta have a ticket. - Press pass. - Oh. - Is the lady going around again too? - No, thanks. I've had enough. The safest ride at the fair. Get tickets now for this ride. Go and get tickets for this ride. It is the longest, fastest thrill ride at the fairgrounds. Get tickets now if you care to ride. Three rings for a dime. Hurry. - You feel safer down here? - Oh! - I thought you were... - I changed my mind. I was standing there watching you walk away. Every step you took, your hair bounced up and down on the back of your neck. It was really nice. I don't know if that's what got me, but here I am. Now it's your turn to say something. What can I say? I don't know you. - I can arrange that. - And all you know about me is that my hair bounces up and down when I walk. - Everybody's hair bounces up and down. - Mine doesn't. I mean, girls. Well, look over there. Well, maybe it wasn't your hair. Maybe it was the way you held your shoulders. - Walk away again. Let me see. - All right. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! - Where are you going? - You told me to walk away. - Yeah, but I... - Really, I have to go anyway. - Why? - Well, I... Well, what? What are you afraid of? - I'm not afraid of anything. - Good. Then what would be wrong with you and me sitting down over there and exchanging our ideas of life over a Coke? Nothing wrong. It's just that... I'm not saying it's a great idea. I'm just asking what's bad about it. What could we lose? Let's give it five minutes. What do you say? Here we are, two people who know nothing about each other. Maybe we should. Maybe it would be fun to find out what we're like. - Maybe it'll be dull. - What do we do if it's dull? - We break it up. - How do we do that? One of us just says, "Let's break it up." That's the end. You go east, I go west. No hard feelings. No questions asked. - Ag reed? - Ag reed. Okay. Here we go. Hold on! Here we go! Hearing words that I have never heard From a man I've yet to meet Now, with rolly coasters, that's different. They're fun. You oughta see the one in New York. There's one in Chicago that's pretty good. There's one out at the beach in Los Angeles. It's not bad, but the one in New York, the one across the river, that's the one. - It's got a dip of 200 feet. - You've been everywhere, haven't you? Not yet. When I first started out in this game, I worked around on different papers. But now, I'm afraid the great Des Moines Register's got me hog-tied. Someday, I'll work on a bigger paper though. I'm sure you will. Well, I think I'd better go the rest of the way alone. I'd have a pretty hard time explaining you to my folks. Yeah, I guess you would. Everybody has a hard time explaining me. - See you again? - Well, I... Or would you like to say, "Let's break it up"? Oh, no! Well, I mean, do you? Look, bobbylocks, don't worry about me. Anytime I wanna throw in the sponge, you'll know it. I just won't be around. Well, I don't know what the family's plans are for tonight. - I don't know where I'll be. - I'll find you. - How? - I'm a newspaperman. It's my job to find the right people at the right time. You'll be seeing me. So long. So long. What's the matter with you? What's the trouble, Blue Boy? Ain't you feelin' good? This ain't like you, son. - Ain't sick, is he? - Huh? Sick? Oh, no, no. He's in fine shape. Just had a long trip. Kind of resting up a bit, that's all. Oh. I thought he was sick. Oh, no. He's never felt better in his life. You see what a spectacle you made of yourself? What are people gonna say about you? - Hello, Hank. - Hello, there. - What you got this year? - Never you mind. She'll put anything you've got in the shade. You wait and see. - Come on. Get along, there. Get along. - Hello, Hank. Hello, there, Frake. How are ya? Ah. You got a duroc this time, huh? - And a good one too. Get in there. - She's got nice color. Well, she oughta have. Her mother before her was the most beautiful red sow in the whole world. - What's her name? - Esmeralda. And she'll win the sweepstakes sure. Now you look like something. I don't mind telling you, though, you had me worried, son, but I knew you'd come through. Now you look like a real champion. - Oh! Excuse me. - Oh! Why don't you look where you're goin'? Gawking around like that, people'll think you've never been to a fair before. I just thought we might meet somebody we know. - So what? - Well, why are you looking around? Who are you looking for? I sort of had a half date, with a guy I met here last year. - Why don't you keep it? - What would I do with you? - Well, look, Wayne... - I beg your pardon, sir. - May I trouble you for a match? - Sure. - I think I have some right here. - That's very kind of you. Okay. - Here you are. Thanks. - Why don't you keep them? - My brother has another pack. - Sure, sure. Go ahead. - That's okay. - Thank you very much. - You're certainly big with my matches. - What do you care? Your pockets are always full of them. Look, Wayne, if you really wanna keep your date with that friend, I wouldn't mind. - You wouldn't? - No. I hardly slept a wink in that old truck last night. What I really wanted to do tonight was to go to bed early but I didn't wanna disappoint you. Oh, don't worry about me. Uh, maybe you'd better. You do look a little tired. - And I can get back all right. - Ah, that's swell, sis. Thanks. I mean, get a good rest now. I will. Hello. Take home a beautiful pennant from the state fair. Come right over. Help yourself. Oh, pardon me. I'm looking for the chief of police's daughter. - Have you seen her around here anyplace? - His daughter? I don't believe I know her. There's the chief over there. Why don't you ask him? Okay. Thank you. - Good evening, Chief. - Good evening, son. What can I do for you? Could you tell me where your daughter is? I sort of had a date to meet her here tonight. - What? - Well, it wasn't exactly a date. She said... I mean, I told her... Well, let's see. She's around here somewhere. Oh, Violet? Yes, Daddy? This young gentleman tells me you two have a date to go out stepping tonight. Huh? Well, I guess I must mean her sister. I haven't got a sister. Looks like someone's been pulling your leg, my boy. Yeah. That's a pretty good joke on me, all right. Well, thanks. How many, please? - Huh? - How many tickets? Oh. One. And now for your favorite, the lovely Emily Edwards, and That's For Me. Right Between the eyes Quite a belt That blow I felt this morning Fate Gave me no warning Great Was my surprise I saw you standing in the sun And you were something to see I know what I like and I liked what I saw And I said to myself that's for me A lovely morning I remarked And you were quick to agree You wanted to walk and I nodded my head As I breathlessly said That's for me I left you standing under stars The day's adventures are through There's nothing for me but the dream in my heart And the dream in my heart That's for you Oh, my darling That's for you - There you are. - Thank you. - Who's that singing? - That's Emily Edwards. She's kind of cute, but she's not my type. She's a redhead. Now, with brown hair, that's different. - Hello, Pat. - Hi, Pat. - Hi, girls. - How are you doin', honey? - Quiet, you. - I guess you know a lot of girls, don't you? Well, in my racket, you know... For you - I, uh, just spoke to your father. - My who? Your father. You know, the chief of police. Oh, that. Didn't you know I was kidding? Well, I do now. And just for that, you're gonna have to have a drink with me. When I first saw you up there, I couldn't believe you were the same girl. Why not? Was I that bad? I didn't mean it that way. You were good, wonderful. That's just it. A girl singer like you with Tommy Thomas's band, I couldn't figure out why you went to all that trouble today just for me. - Why shouldn't I? What's wrong with you? - Oh, nothing wrong with me. I mean, well, maybe there is, but don't tell me. - Like to dance? - Uh-huh. Do you? Sure. That's why I brought it up. Sure. - We can get our drinks later. - All right. The big feature ride of the fair. Get your tickets for the next ride. This is the highest, fastest, safest ride at the fairgrounds. Get tickets now for the big, fast ride. - Come on. I dare you. - I'm game. - How many? - Two, please. - What you thinking about? - Why? Oh, you sort of had a funny smile on your face. - You really want to know? - Uh-huh. Well, I was just thinking about you practicing all that time with your mother's embroidery hoops just to get even with somebody. I guess you think I'm kind of screwy, don't you? No, I don't. I don't at all. As a matter of fact, I like that kind of a fellow. That's lucky for me, because I like the kind of a girl who likes that kind of fellow. It's a grand night for singing The moon is flying high And somewhere a bird who is bound he'll be heard ls throwing his heart at the sky It's a grand night for singing The stars are bright above The earth is aglow and to add to the show I think I am falling in love Falling Falling in love It's a grand night for singing The stars are bright above The earth is aglow and to add to the show I think I am falling in love Falling Falling in love Maybe it's more than the moon Maybe it's more than the birds Maybe it's more than the sight of the night In a light too lovely for words Maybe it's more than the earth Shiny in silvery blue Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way Has something to do with you Say, you're pretty good in that voice department yourself. I'm an old glee club boy. The moon is flying high And somewhere a bird who is bound he'll be heard ls throwing his heart at the sky It's a grand night for singing The stars are bright above The earth is aglow and to add to the show I think I am falling in love Falling Falling in love It's a grand night for singing The moon is flying high And somewhere a bird who is bound he'll be heard Is throwing his heart at the sky It's a grand night for singing The stars are bright above The earth is aglow and to add to the show I think I am falling in love Falling Falling in love And you were something to see I know what I like and I liked what I saw And I said to myself that's for me A lovely morning I remarked And you were quick to agree You wanted to walk and I nodded my head As I breathlessly said That's for me I left you standing under stars - The day's adventures are through - Ow! There's nothing for me but the dream in my heart And the dream in my heart that's For you Oh, my darling That's For you Hey, cut that out! I'll get you for that. You wait and see now. You just wait. You two sound like you had a wonderful time last night. - Sure did. - Mmm, terrific. Wish your father was enjoying himself instead of brooding over that old pig. Say, I thought you were going to bed early last night. Oh. Well, I was going to, but I changed my mind. I went for a ride on the roller coaster. - It's much better than it was last year. - Oh, okay. I tell you, he's raring to go. When I left him just now, he was strutting around prouder than a peacock. - You'd think he owned the place. - Thank goodness. Maybe now you'll give me a little time. Yes, sir, he's all right. Wait till you see him. There ain't a hog ever was or ever will be that can touch him. For what we're about to receive, O Lord, make us duly thankful. Amen. - You said grace before, Daddy. - Yeah. I did? Well, I'm going to keep on saying it all day. I just hope he stays like he is till the judges see him! Why, they hardly tasted them! And I like my sweet pickles best. They don't have to taste much. They're experts. Don't be so jittery, Mother. - There's that Mrs. Metcalfe. - Hmm? - Behind the lady in the red hat. - Oh, yes, I see her. So biggety. Why, she was just lucky last year. Her pies weren't half as good as yours. - Why, hello, Mrs. Metcalfe. Pardon me. - Hello. Going to win all the prizes again this year? I don't know about all, but I have high hopes for my pickles and mincemeat. Same as you. Look. They like your sour pickles. This is the last year I'm ever gonna enter anything. - It isn't worth it. - Oh, Mother, you say that every year. Please. Thank you. Well, aren't they going to announce their decision? Not until they finish with the mincemeat. Thank you. I don't remember telling you to cover this part of the fair. Hello, boss. Thought you were specializing in human interest stories on the midway. What's wrong with putting in a plug for the housewives of our state? That, my friend, is Mrs. America. Do tell. And what dainty putter-upper of what delicious preserve is the cause of your presence here? Look, forget you're the managing editor of a newspaper and try to act intelligent. Have you ever seen me with the type who's a good cook? No, but I've seen you with every other kind. You had to get around to these sometime. Shove off. Let me finish this story. It's for your paper. Sure. Only I hope it's better than the one you turned in last night, "Fun on a Roller Coaster." Ouch. Boy, you'd better hope the old man misses that one or he'll never give you a shot at that job in Chicago. That's yours, isn't it? Mmm. Do you think they liked it? They must have. They certainly ate enough. Your attention, please. Silence, please. ladies and gentlemen. Quiet, please! We are now ready to announce the awards. Sweet pickles. First prize to Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe of Pottsville. Second prize to... To Mrs. Agnes Field of Arcadia. Sour pickles. First prize to Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick. Oh, Mother. Second prize to Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe. And now, ladies and gentlemen... Quiet, please. As you know, we occasionally give a plaque for distinguished achievement. As you are doubtlessly aware, this plaque is only given in rare cases. And on this occasion, my colleagues and I have voted unanimously that it be given to a lady who has concocted the most delicious, the most succulent and spiciest mincemeat ever entered in a state fair. The lady who wins this distinction is none other than Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick. - Oh, Mother! Oh! - Congratulations. I'm so glad. I've got the most a woman can get in life, Margy. - If I think any more about it, I'll cry. - Stand where you are, please. Hold it. Thank you. Thank you very much, ladies. Your picture will appear in the Register tomorrow morning. Good day. - See, Mother? You're famous. - I'm worn out. I'm going up to the trailer and lie down. I never knew what a strain it was to get something you really wanted. - I'll take these, dear. - Oh, my hat too. Now you run along and enjoy yourself. My horse is number 8, Tessie In the green shirt. Come on, Tessie! Come on! Get up there. Come on! Attagirl, Tessie. Pass her! Pass her! Attagirl, Tess! Oh, she made it! She won! She won! Oh, Pat, your horse won! it can't be much fun for you just hanging around waiting to catch me between songs. Can't think of anything I'd rather be doing. Anyway, we can... I mean, can we go someplace after the show? I thought maybe we'd have something to eat or something. Well, I can't tonight, Wayne. - It's Marty's birthday. - Who's Marty? The boy I sing with in the band. We're giving a surprise party for him. Wouldn't you like to come? I was kind of counting on being alone with you. I know. I'd like that better too. But this is a party we cooked up a week ago. We're giving it in my rooms at the hotel - so I can't very well back out now. - Hey, Emily. - They're playing the introduction. - All right, Marty. Now don't go away. I'll be right back. Okay, let's go. Listen, kids, I got the greatest number here... McGee, if you ever scare me like that again... I got the greatest number I ever plugged, and I'm gonna give you first crack at it. Buzz off, McGee. We're busy. Eh, just like all singers, they don't like songs. - Hi, buddy. - Hello. - You in the music business? - No. I'm a farmer. A farmer. What a night I'm having. Well, uh, you're a friend of Emily's, ain't ya? That's right. - My name's McGee. - My name's Wayne Frake. - You in the music business? - Yeah, I'm a song plugger. - I work on songs till they get popular. - How do you mean work on 'em? I thought songs got popular because people like 'em. That's naive. How can people like a song if they don't hear it? You got to get the big singers to sing it first. How do you do that? There's all kinds of ways, and none of them is easy. You got no idea what a snook like me has to do to get a song on the hit parade. Last week I fell down in front of Dinah Shore's taxi just to get in conversation with her. Every Christmas, I got to remember to send Sinatra a new bow tie. When a bandleader's wife has a baby, I gotta stay home with it on the nurse's night out. It's a big question whether Mairzy Doats would have been a hit if I hadn't had known how to change a "didey." - Is that a new song you got there? - Yeah, and it's a honey. A natural for your friend Emily. You wouldn't wanna help me get it to her, would ya? I am not at all niggardly when it comes to payola. - Payola? - Ah, it's a technical term. Forget it. The man who wrote this song is starving in an attic in Brooklyn. His wife ran out on him, left him penniless with two kids. She even took the piano with her so now he can't write no more. If this song ain't a hit, there's only one thing left for this man, the river. On the other hand, if somebody was to get a great artist like Emily Edwards to introduce it with a band on the radio, this man's fortune would be made and his genius preserved for posterity. How do you know he ain't another Stephen Foster? - I don't. Only... - Just read those words. Here. Take a couple of copies. I'll hum the tune so you can see how they fit. Follow me. Right there. It's a grand night for singing The stars are bright above The earth is aglow and to add to the show I think I am falling in love Falling Falling in love Maybe it's more than the moon Maybe it's more than the birds Maybe it's more than the sight of the night In a light too lovely for words Maybe it's more than the earth Shiny in silvery blue Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way Has something to do with you It's a grand night for singing The stars are bright above The earth is aglow and to add to the show I think I am falling in love Falling Falling in love La, la, la, la, la, la - Hey, where's my drink? - Let's see what else we've got here. Look, Wayne, how about your singing a chorus? No, thanks. You're doing all right without me. - But I want them to hear you. - You can't be as good as she says. - You'd be surprised. Come on. - No, really. Come on. Don't tell me we have to coax you. How about singing one of those corn-fed ditties you guys sing around these little towns? - Come on, Wayne. Sing anything you like. - Yeah, you can't tell. You might have something we can use with the band. As a matter of fact, if you need a new song, I've got one right here I like very much. He didn't expect to sing, but he brought his music with him. - Would you like to try it with me? - You do it yourself. - Did you write it? - No, I didn't. A fellow gave it to me. - Okay, bud. - Okay, bud. This ought to be something. Maybe you'll never be the love of my life Maybe I'm not the boy of your dreams But isn't it kind of fun to look in each other's eyes Swapping romantic gleams Maybe you're not a girl to have and to hold Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay But isn't it kind of fun carousing around the town Dancing the night away Isn't it kind of fun holding hands According to a sweet and corny custom Isn't it kind of fun making vows Admitting that we both intend to bust 'em Maybe we're out for laughs A girl and a boy Kidding across a table for two But haven't you got a hunch that this is the real McCoy And all the things we tell each other Are true I'm not a girl for sentimental tripe I never go for the Romeo type Over a dewy-eyed Juliet No one has seen me drool yet I don't say our hearts are tied By love's eternal tether But using words less dignified Isn't it kind of fun to be together Maybe you'll never be the love of my life Maybe I'm not the girl of your dreams But isn't it kind of fun to look in each other's eyes Swapping romantic gleams Maybe I'm not a girl to have and to hold Well, maybe I'm not a boy who would stay But isn't it kind of fun carousing around the town Dancing the night away Oh, isn't it kind of fun holding hands According to a sweet and corny custom Isn't it kind of fun making vows Admitting that we both intend to bust 'em Maybe we're out for laughs A girl and a boy Kidding across a table for two - But haven't you got a hunch - That this is the real McCoy And all the things we tell each other Are true - Wonderful. - That was great. You know, you're right about that song, Wayne. I like it too. - You do? - "Billings Publishing Company," huh? - A guy named McGee give you this? - That's right. How much did he slip you for plugging it tonight? Wait a minute, Marty! He didn't slip me anything. Didn't he promise to come through with the old payola? - He used that expression. - I'll bet he did. That's great, Emily. Your boyfriend cashing in on you. - How do you like that? - Wayne! Wayne. Wayne, wait a minute. I'm sorry, Emily. I just couldn't help it. He's been putting in digs ever since I got here. I know he was asking for it, but please don't go. You don't think I'd cash in on being friends with you like he said, do you? Of course not. And he wouldn't have said it, only he's had a few drinks. - Please come back. - It just wouldn't work, Emily. I'd let him have it the first time he opened his mouth. Look. Why don't you walk around the block? Give me a chance to get rid of them. How about that? I'd hate to have you break up the party. I'll tell them I have a headache. When you come back, we'll be alone. That's the way you wanted it, isn't it? - Okay. How long? - Come back in half an hour. Emily, I... - Half an hour. - Make it 15 minutes. All right. Only a few stars left. Yeah, and they look kind of tired. Funny how a day creeps on. So slowly at first you think it's never coming. Then all of a sudden, it spreads out over the sky, the sun starts shining. People loom up like that too. Are you really gonna go home and marry that guy you're engaged to? That's what girls usually do, isn't it? Marry the men they're engaged to. Yeah. They're usually sorry afterward. Think you'll every marry? Who, me? Sure. Sometime. Only trouble is, if I ever found a girl I cared that much about, I'd care too much about it to wish a guy like me off on her. - Sounds kind of hopeless. - I guess it is. It's pretty hard for me to picture myself, what do they call it, popping the question. Can you imagine me suddenly turning to some girl and blurting out, "Will you marry me?" No. I can see you wouldn't. Well, bobbylocks, you've made a very wise decision. Anyway, I'd be no good for you, no good at all. Of course, you'd be awfully good for me. Say, what about your old man's hog? Aren't they gonna judge him this afternoon? Oh, yes. I guess I'd better be going. - Wayne's probably in already. - it's getting pretty late. - Don't you want me to go with you? - No. It's better if you don't. - Will I see you tonight? - In front of the roller coaster? 8:30. Well, I... - Good night, honey. - Good night. - Pat? - Yes? I was only talking. I couldn't marry anybody but you, ever. Well, Blue Boy, this is the great day, your hour of judgment. Now take it easy there now. Don't get your face dirty. Look, Mother, Blue Boy's already won. There's his blue ribbon. Oh, that thing? That's only the class award. That means he's won his class of senior boars. I'm getting him ready now to go in for the grand championship. - Is he all right? - All right? Why, just look at him. He's fit as a fiddle. Class 51, Hampshire senior sows, - pavilion number two. - Better go in now, son. Get seated. We go in right after this. - We'd better get going. - Good luck, Pa. - Thanks, Ma. - You too, Blue Boy. - We'll be pulling for you. - All right. Bye. See you later. Well, let's see. Is your face clean, son? Yes, you're all right. You gotta look your best, you know. You taking her in, Hank? No, not yet. Just taking her out to put her on the scale. Blue Boy, what's the matter, son? Oh, you think Esmeralda's gone home. No, she's just gone out to be weighed. Hampshire boars, get ready, please. That's us, son. Come on. Get up. Oh, don't act this way. Esmeralda will be back. She ain't gonna be judged until after you win. Come on, boy. Get up. You hear that? That's the band. They're playing for you, son. You can't lay down on me now. Oh, come on, fella, please. Attention, please. Attention. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor of introducing to you a man whom you all know, Congressman James A. Goodheart. During this great day of boar judging, you have seen hundreds of seemingly perfect boars eliminated, leaving only two contestants, the junior champion and the senior champion, both perfect specimens representing excellence of breeding. The judges realize the importance of their decision, for the boar they decide is the better will be acclaimed grand champion boar of this year's state fair. Introducing the first contestant, Whirlwind... number 188. Winner, junior champion boar. Owner, Mr. R.C. Martin. He's awful big, isn't he? Blue Boy will outpoint him. And now, for the second contestant, introducing Blue Boy. - Where's Dad? - Yes, now what? Where is he? Introducing Blue Boy, number 1494. Winning senior champion boar. Owner, Mr. Abel Frake. Whoa, Blue Boy. Whoa, Blue Boy. Whoa, Blue Boy. Whoa, Blue Boy. They didn't look at him very long, did they? They'll be back. Blue Boy, get up. Get up on your feet. The judges will see you. Oh, this is terrible. He'll lose sure. Get up, Blue Boy. Blue Boy! Come on, son. Get up. Son? What's the matter with him? Get him up. - We can't judge him lying down. - Come on, Blue Boy! Get up, will ya? Blue Boy, come on! Blue Boy, come on. Come on, son. Get up. Come on, Blue Boy. Get up, will you? Come on, Blue Boy. Come on. Just a little tired, that's all. Attention, please. Attention. I have the honor to announce the winner of this year's grand championship. Hampshire boar, Blue Boy. it gives me great pleasure. Congratulations. - Thank you. - I'm so happy! - Oh, Pa! - Congratulations, Mr. Frake. My, my. Whoever wrote this must be a friend of the Frake family. "As Mr. Abel Frake won the grand award, "he was watched from the grandstand by his charming wife, "and talented and beautiful daughter Marguerite." - Come on, Wayne. It's getting late. - Just a minute. Say, you look mighty pretty tonight. Is that a new dress? - Uh-huh. Do you like it? - Prettiest girl I ever saw. Okay, I'm ready. Not too late now. We wanna get an early start in the morning. Might be a little late. It's the last night. So long, Dad. - Bye. - So long. They look nice together, don't they? Hmm? What'd you say? I said we had two lovely children. Who said we didn't? I wish Margy would make up her mind about Harry. Why? He won't run away. He's one of those goody-goody boys. I don't see anything wrong with that. You were a good boy when I fell in love with you. That's what you thought. Well, since you're such a gay dog, you'd better take me to the midway tonight for a little fun. - No, Ma, you're all tired out. - Who said I was tired? Say. Here's something interesting. It's about that judge, the fella that gave you the plaque. It says here how he had a kind of seizure afterwards, delirium tremens sort of. "While Mr. Hippenstahl was unconscious, "he kept murmuring something about mincemeat. "Those nearby declared they could smell brandy on his breath." You fool. Now, just for that, you've got to take me out. Oh, no, Ma. I've got that nice tired-out feeling. - You and I are going to the fair. - I've seen the fair. You've seen the hog pavilion. Are you going to get out of that chair? Now, Ma, I'm up. Now go on in and change your clothes. Go on. I want some excitement. I can hear 'em calling hogs in the clear Ioway air I can sniff the fragrant whiff of an Ioway rose You've got Ioway in your heart I've got Ioway in my hair I've got Ioway in my ears and eyes and nose Oh, I know all I owe I owe Ioway I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why I am Ioway born and bred And on Ioway corn I'm fed Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye I owe Ioway for her ham And her beef and her lamb And her strawberry jam And her pie I owe Ioway more than I can ever pay So I think I'll move to Calif om-i-ay - What a shame - What a shame You'll be good and gosh darn sorry when you go - Don't I know - When you leave your native state You'll be feeling far from great You'll be good and gosh darn sorry when you go I'm a seed Of Ioway grain You're a breeze That Ioway blew I'm a drop Of Ioway rain You're a drip of Ioway dew Oh, I know all I owe I owe Ioway - I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why - Ioway I am Ioway born and bred And on Ioway corn I'm fed Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye I owe Ioway for her ham And her beef and her lamb And her strawberry jam And her pie That's right. I owe Ioway more than anyone should owe So I think I'll start in owing Idaho All together. - What a shame - What a shame - You'll be crying like a baby when you go - Don't I know When I leave my native heath With my lip between my teeth I'll be bawling like a booby when I go You're a seed Of Ioway grain You're a breeze That Ioway blew I'm a drop Of Ioway rain You're a drip Of Ioway dew Oh, I know all I owe - I owe Ioway - I owe Ioway - I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why - I owe Ioway I am Ioway born and bred and on Ioway corn I'm fed - Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye - Barley, wheat and rye I owe Ioway for her ham And her beef and her lamb - And her strawberry jam and her pie - Pie, pie, pie, pie - I owe Ioway more than anyone should owe - Oh So I think I'll start in owing Idaho Better stay You'll be good and gosh darn sorry if you go Don't I know When you leave your native state You'll be feeling far from great You'll be good and gosh darn sorry when you go I owe Ioway for her ham and her beef and her lamb And her strawberry jam and her pie I owe Ioway more than I can ever pay So I think I'll move to Californ-i-ay I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W-A! Hooray! Ioway! Yea! What do you think of this imitation champagne, Ma? First time I ever tried it, and I love it. It's as good as that French champagne any day. - Did you ever taste French champagne? - No. Who's that little runt? - Hmm? - What's he grinning at? That's Mr. Hippenstahl, the pickle and mincemeat judge. Oh. Oh! Well, that explains it. He's drunk! - Quiet, Pa. - Come on, Ma. - Let's get out on the midway. - All right. Hey, buddy! I wanna thank you for the plug you gave that song last night. It's all set with Tommy Thomas for Emily to sing it in Chicago tomorrow night. - Chicago? - Yeah. That's their next date, the Palmer House. I'm going with them on the plane tonight. Sticking close so they won't change their mind. Emily didn't say she was... I didn't figure on them leaving tonight. Sure, right after the show. I wish she'd hurry up and get out here. I wanna talk to her. Kind of went overboard for each other, didn't you, kid? - Kind of. - She told me. Oh, they all tell me everything. - You going back to the farm soon? - Tomorrow. That'll be good. Come in. - Oh, hello. - I was just on my way out. - I'll say you are. Where's your suitcase? - Suitcase? What for? The old man just phoned from Chicago. He's gonna give you a crack at that job. - The Eastern syndicate? - That's right. A column of your own. - I can't believe it. - He's leaving for the coast in the morning and he wants you to fly up to Chicago and talk to him tonight. - That means the 8:30 plane. - How much time have I got? Practically none. I'm holding a taxi downstairs. I'll get your shaving things. - Hey, wait! - What's the matter? I can't leave now. I've got a girl waiting for me out at the fair. - What'll I do? - Do? Get another girl in Chicago. A girl waiting at the fair. I break my neck getting this chance for you and you start yapping about some girl. - This is different. This is not just a girl. - I know. She's wonderful. Only girl in the world. And I suppose this job is just a job. The kind that comes up every day. Look, I wanna make something very clear to you, sonny-boy. The old man is funny. When he wants you someplace, you better, or you're through. - I know that, but... - Do you want this job or don't you? You've got about two minutes to make up your mind. Thank you very much. - What did she say? - She sees a lot of money coming my way. - Good. I can use some. - I don't think it'll do you much good. She says I'm going to marry three times. There they are, folks, the eight fugitives from the Follies. They did a little dance in New York, but the police commissioner objected. He demanded that they take certain things out of the dance. Understand? Well, rather than do the emasculated version, they come out here to give you the original dance with nothing cut out. Just to prove to you what you're gonna see on the inside... Okay, Mike, let her rip! - Do you want to go in? - Huh? It means nothing to me, but if you'd like to see it, I'd be glad to take you in, hmm? Hmm? What do you think? Of course, like I say, it means nothing to me unless you wanna go in. You do? Come on. Two, please. - Enjoying yourself? - Yes, we are. That's good. What's that old buzzard doing, following you around? Don't be foolish, Abel. He's seeing the fair, having fun, same as we are. All aboard. Train now leaving. Get tickets for this ride. Another train coming in. Get your tickets for that high, fast ride through the sky, on the big roller coaster the big feature ride of the fair. But last night and all the things we said, was that just kidding? No, Wayne, it wasn't just kidding. Well, it certainly wasn't with me. I thought that... Oh, what's the difference what I thought? But, Wayne, darling, I thought you understood that... Well, after all, we were just two people who met at a fair... And fell in love, didn't we? Well, that was something I hadn't bargained for. Wayne, will you believe something? Just one thing. It's every bit as hard for me to give you up as it is for... Well, then why do it? Why give each other up? Why don't you come with me, meet my father and mother and go home with us tomorrow? - Because I can't, Wayne. I... - Hey, Emily. - You ready? - No, she isn't! I'll be right in, Marty. Wait here, Wayne. I have to tell you something, something I should have told you before, and I would have, if I hadn't been such a coward. Please, wait, Wayne. Please. You mind if I say something? - Such as what? - First, let me get something straight. When you said that about taking Emily home with you, did you mean the works, a wedding ring and all? That's it, the works. And that's the way it's gonna be. Look, I'll give it to you quick. She's married. She's got a husband, see? He don't work at it very hard. They split up about a year ago. He claims he's a songwriter, but he's just no good at it. As a matter of fact, he's just no good, period. She liked him, though. Sort of knocked her out for a while. Come to think of it, you're the first guy she's looked at since then. I guess I just don't understand the people in your business. Take my word, they're the same as anybody else. They make mistakes, sure, but don't everybody? Are all the people in your town perfect? Why didn't she tell me? She told you why. She didn't want to spoil everything. Maybe she figured she had a right to a little happiness too. You know what you and me need right now? A drink. How about it, buddy? Ring the old pipe! There she goes. 47! He's getting higher and higher! 48! Who's next? Not bad. Not bad at all, Mr. Frake. Not bad, huh? Thank you. But you didn't ring the bell, though. Ho, ho, ho. I know I didn't ring the bell, though. Ho, ho, ho. - Who can? Can you? - I don't know. I never tried. - Why don't you? - I don't know, but I will. Step right up, neighbor. Step right up. - It's kind of heavy, isn't it? - Allow me. Thank you. Now, I suppose the idea is to lean your weight on it. Yes. Put all your 120 pounds in it. Come on, Ma. I'm tired. Let's go home. I suppose it's too late to stop someplace for a cup of coffee. Who said it was too late? - Easy does it, pal. Easy does it. - I'm okay. Sure, you are. What about this Eleanor, the girl from back home? You say you graduated from school together, huh? Yep. She's a fine girl too. What does she look like, redhead? - Nope. Blond. - Oh. I like the redheads. There's a redhead lives on the floor below me. What a dish! I keep thinking, I'll get off the elevator at the wrong floor, but I never do. Why not? Why don't you? And have my wife make a cripple out of me for life? One shoe off, and the other shoe off. Diddle, diddle, dumpling my son John Hey, that don't rhyme like it used to. Did I ever tell you about Eleanor? She's a girl I went to school with. - Yes. I know. I know. - Wonderful! Just the girl for you. Wonderful girl. Look, bobbylocks, don't worry about me. Anytime I want to throw in the sponge, you'll know it. I just won't be around. - You about ready? - Yes. See you next year. Yes, indeed. We'll be here. Take good care of yourself. We will. All right, son, get aboard. - Bye! - Bye! I can't remember when I've been as tired. It's that resting you did at the fair, Ma. Three days' rest will tire anybody out. - Good-bye, Hank! - Good-bye, Frake! See you next year. You bet. For goodness sake, what's the matter, Margy? You're crying like there was never gonna be another fair. We'll be back next year. - I never want to see another fair. - You can say that again. You meet a lot of people who play you for a sucker and have some laughs at your expense. When the fair's over, what? Just chalk it up to experience, I guess. Sure, that's why you go to a fair, experience. Something new, different. Yes, sir, the Frakes are coming home in grand style. You got your plaque, I got the grand award, we're all well and happy, and Dave Miller owes me five bucks. There you are. That's Melissa's plaque for mincemeat. And this is mine. First prize for the best boar in the state. So, you see, Gloomy Gus, you lost your bet. Nobody got sick and nothing bad happened to any of us. Only thing is, something might have happened we don't know about. None of that now. Come across. $5.00. - Lemonade, Mr. Miller? - Yes! Thank you, Mrs. Frake. Believe I will. Would have done your heart good to hear 'em in church this morning. Everybody talking about the Frakes and all the prizes you won. Well, that's nice. See you later. I won't be home for dinner. - All right, son. - Where are you going? Oh, just for a little drive. Did Wayne have a good time? He looks a little down. Had the time of his life, far as I can make out. Mr. Miller. Abel? No, not now, Ma. Headache better, dear? How about you, Margy? Did you have a good time at the fair? Answer that, Margy. It's probably Harry for you. Well, go on, dear. Don't let it ring all day. - Well? - Let's not be hasty about this now. Hello? Doesn't anybody ever answer the telephone at your house? Pat! Oh, Pat! Here? In Brunswick? Oh, yes. Yes, I do. I do, Pat! That's all I wanna know. 'Cause you're going back to Chicago with me. You're gonna be the wife of a columnist. Yeah. How do I drive out to your place? Where are you now? Is your car pointed toward the hotel or the Elk's hall? Well, get in and keep it going in that direction. Just keep going until you see me. Oh, yes, and hurry! Hurry! Hurry. Margy, you didn't answer my question. Did you have a good time at the fair? Oh, yes, Mr. Miller! It was the most wonderful fair in the whole world! There! You see? What did I tell you? Margy! Margy! That's Mr. Miller's car! Well! She'll be right back, I'm sure. $5.00. Oh, Pat! Hi! It's a grand night for singing The stars are bright above The earth is aglow and to add to the show I think I am falling in love Falling Falling in love
