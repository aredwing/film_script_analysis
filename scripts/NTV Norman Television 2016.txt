How could you? Oh, Marilyn, you should have seen this coming. Please, let's just talk about this. Can't we just... I wonder what else is on. What kind of a moron goes out in public in his underpants? Hello! Wacky neighbor, you're so crazy. Time for my cooking show. Pinch of nutmeg. Oh, that looks delicious. Little bit of that. A- ha! Stand back, Orcs of Mordor! Behold, Gandorf the Great. You shall not pass! A- ha! En garde. Take that! What the... A little sweet tea for my sweetie? Harold, what are you doing? Nothing. So sorry. I seem to have spilled the tea. Clumsy of me. Poison? Harold, don't come any closer! Honey, this is just a misunderstanding. You just stay away from me! I don't think so. Leave me alone. Not the eyes! Yes! Where are you? Ha! I'm gonna get you. You shall not pass! Mommy! Behold my wrath! All right, pal. Move it along. You're lucky I don't smite you with my powers, vile fiend. So I guess that means you're single now? Yowzer! Wacky neighbor. Where are your pants?
