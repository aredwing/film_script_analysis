Right, come on, Pete-boy, here we go... You ready? - Yes. - Catch! Very good! Right, your turn now then. - Ok? - Yes. Hello... you wanna play with us? - Yeah. - Alright... you stand over there, I'll take you both on. Tommy! Oh, Tommy... Mummy's got to go now. - I'm so sorry. - Ok. - Come on, the bell's gone. - Too bad, Pete. Back soon. We'll have another go, ok? Take it easy, boy. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Uhh! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thank you. Hello, Martin. - Want a word? - Yeah, thanks. Come on in then. Let's have some coffee, Jack. Putting on a bit of weight, isn't he? Huh. Too much chocolate. They all spoil him. And why not? Anything he needs? Well you can bring some rubber nappies next time if you like. Thanks, Jack. Can't have too many of those. We never managed to get him house-trained, for some reason. Thanks. Hasn't got much longer, has he? Well he's already had longer than most, Martin. - Should I get mother down? - No, no... he wouldn't know her, not after all this time. Only disturb her. Wouldn't help him. He'd miss me though, wouldn't he? Ahh, you're part of a pattern. He expects you. Tell me, how are things at home, Martin? Fine! No, leave it. It doesn't matter. Well, better be getting back. Sorry about the cup. Thanks. Martin... How about you... how are you getting on? Me? That's the stuff! Bye. How does this one work? How much is the Moon Explorer? Thirty-nine and eleven, miss. Oh lord, that's far too much. - I'll take one of these. - Thank you. Twenty-five shillings. There's your receipt. Here we are, miss. Thank you. Just a moment, you two. - Me? - Both of you. Would you mind coming to the manager's office, please. Alright, then. Perhaps you two would care to explain? Explain what? The toys you have in your possession. I bought a toy... I paid for it... and here's the receipt. Yes we know. And while you kept the assistant busy, your... boyfriend here... put another toy in his pocket and didn't pay for it. Boyfriend?! I've never seen him before in my life! They do know each other, Mr Goss. That's right. We saw the looks they exchanged. You know, you'll find it much easier... if you make a clean breast of it. I tell you, he's a complete stranger! Well don't just sit there... tell them! Please. Hmm... we know what he'll say. Here it is, Mr Goss. In his pocket. Now then, young man... before I call the police... what have you to say? Georgie likes ducks. Never meant to take it. He forgot. Absent minded, eh? So your name's Georgie, is it? And your friend here, what's her name? Georgie has no friends. Georgie wants to go home now. I dare say he does... but let's see what he's got in the other pocket first. Look, I think there's been some kind of a mistake, don't you? I'm sorry you've been involved in this, miss. If I could have your name and address. Yes, of course. Susan Harper... 17, Richmond Grove. You will let him go, won't you? I shall have to report it, miss. Oh, for a two and sixpenny toy? Surely, if I pay for it? - Well you don't have to, miss. - No, I'd like to, please. - Here. - Thank you. It's very good of you. Georgie... This is yours, now. So sorry, madam. Most unfortunate. Thank you. A toy duck. How about that? Now tell me, why in God's name does he have to steal a toy duck?! Wish I knew, Darling. Are you sure? I mean... wh.. wh.. what's gone wrong? - Is it my fault? - No, of course not. If anybody's to blame it's me... I've spoilt him. And I've helped you. You've been wonderful. If he'd been your own son... I've have done a damn sight less! I mean it isn't as if he's stupid. What did his tutor at Oxford say... 'Could be brilliant'. What happens? - Gets himself sent down. - Darling, he did explain. Oh, he always explains. Look at those jobs I found him... how long did he keep them? Not everyone's cut out for a stockbroker's office. Then what is he cut out for? He was keen on farming... where did that get us? Christopher takes him on, within twenty-four hours... young Pamela runs screaming to her mother... where did they find him... stark naked in her bedroom! Be fair, Henry... no girl is that innocent. She must have given him some encouragement. I tell you, Enid... if we don't teach him, I know who will... the police. - I'll talk to him. - No! There'll be no more talking. This time something's gotta be done. And I'm gonna do it! Now, how about that... there you are you see... typical! Comes creeping in, sneaks upstairs... disappears without a word! I'd like to know what he does up there... day after day, with a door locked! Now come along, Martin... your father says you're to get up. And give me that... it's going to be thrown out. But you gave it to me! You were in nappies once... you don't still need them, do you? No, Mummy... I don't. And all this other junk... that's going too. You've just to to grow up! Marty, Darling... here... What made you take it, Marty? This? Well... he'll have fun with this. But you could have paid for it. I was going to. Cow of a store detective never game me a chance! Honest, Mummy. Oh, Darling, is that a spot? Hmm? Oh, you've got such a lovely skin. Must take care of it. Yup... I do. I wish you wouldn't go down there. Disturbs you. Does it? Ghastly place! You put 'im there. It hasn't done his bladder much good, I can tell you that. - That's cruel, Marty! - It's the truth. - He's happier there! - Is he? Of course he is! Anyway, I had your future to think about. Oh, I know... Pete would have been a bit of a handicap... in the marriage stakes, wouldn't he? You might never have made it. Oh, stop it, Martin! Don't worry, Mum... it's our secret. I'll never tell the old bastard. Stop it, I say! - Your father... - That's not my father! Mine's six feet under in Putney... chasing worms! And from what I remember of 'im... they'll be enjoying his company. Martin, I sometimes wonder... whether you feel anything for anybody. 'Cept you, Mummy. Ok... all yours. Yes... you're right. Have you got the time? Yes, ten-past nine. Oh, goodness... I am late. Ere... got any change, mate? And the best of British luck to you too! - See you, bye. - Yes, see you this evening. Come along, all inside. Hold tight. He, he, he. Here we are... how 'bout this? 'The Tower of London'? Get off! That's history, innit?! Well, that's blood-thirsty enough. Even for you, Johnny. Any girls in it? Well there's Lady Jane Grey. She gets the chopper. I'd rather 'ave Lady Chatterley. Mmm, I bet you would! But you take this... you'll like it, I promise you. Thank you. - There you are. - Thanks. - See ya! - Goodbye, doll! Bye. Yes, please? Hello. Georgie! Hello! What are you doing here? What's this for? The duck. But I told you... that was a present. A... present for you. For me? Oh, thank you, Georgie! Thank you, very much! But how did you find me? Followed you. Where from? Your home. But if you were there, why didn't I see you? There was a black man with you. Oh, Shashie. He's a 'P.G.' A 'Paying Guest', he lives with us. Does he take you to the cinema? He hasn't yet... he might. Georgie could take you! Oh... well... that's very sweet of you, Georgie, but I can't. Honestly, I have to work at night. Here? At home... for my exams. I want to be a teacher, Georgie. Oh. Look, you can't go around like that... Here, let me. Take these, Miss Harper. Look... I don't know whether you're dressing or undressing your friend... but I do wish you wouldn't do it in the public library! Sorry, Georgie. I must get on with my work now, really. Goodbye. Thank you for the chocolates. Please. Can't Georgie have a book? About animals. Of course you can. Come on, we'll find one. Got your ticket? No. Oh... Where do you live, Georgie? In hotels... in London. With my Daddy. I tell you what... I'll take it out in my name... and when you've finished, bring it back. But be sure you do or I'll get into trouble. Ok? Yes... Susan. What a load of crap! Martin! Martin! Oh... Come down a moment, please. Come in, lad... sit down. I've good news for you... you're off to Australia, Perth... in about three weeks time. Am I? Yes. I've spoken to our people... they fixed a job for you. Sheep farming. Oh, what you make of the job is up to you. I see. Everything's settled then, is it? Yes... air ticket, passport. Your permit will be through in a few days time. Oh, you'll need clothes of course, but get 'em out there. I'll pay. And Mum? She heard the good news? She has... Upset? Buckets of tears? She's upset, of course... but, she agrees. Of course. Always upset, always agrees. I want none of that... this is for your good! Mine? Not yours? Or hers? Martin... the one thing in the world your Mother most wants... is a man out of you! Now, don't you give a damn about that? Her happiness? What do you think? I'll tell you what I think... I think the most worrying thing about you is... that you haven't got a single friend. Not one! - Haven't I? - Well who? Come on, tell me... who!? Wouldn't you like to know. And now it's about time I let you into a little secret... You mind? You... can't send me anywhere! Can't I? No. I've over twenty-one. Then it's bloody well time you acted like it! So I'm not going. But thanks for the offer. Well you're not staying either. How about that!? Here... you can try starting as I did... with fifty pounds. Lets see how far you get. Now... pack up! Go on! I want you out of this house by tomorrow. Ok. And I may need this. Thanks. Dad. Tomorrow... you understand?! Keep the change. Face it, Enid... he's not normal. Now, where the devil did I put those cufflinks? Oh, it's alright, here they are. He should have seen that psychiatrist... when I wanted him to. Please, God... Oh, thank you, sir. Belgravia, 00102, please. - Your Belgravia number, sir. - Thanks. Hello, Mummy? This is Martin. Oh, Marty, Darling... thank God you phoned! Where are you? London Airport. What are you doing there? Listen Mummy, I'm off to Paris in a few minutes. Paris?! Mummy, listen. I had a row with Dad last night. Yes, I know. I'm sorry, Mummy. He was right. I was wrong. Tell him I am going to Australia... if that's what he wants. Oh... Darling, of course! Must go now, flight's been called. I'll be back in... two weeks. Ok? But Marty, Darling... tell me, why Paris? What made you... I'll write you, Mummy. Goodbye. Silly old cow! I want this posted for me in Paris. Any ideas? - Full of them, sir. - Know anyone going today? - You leave it to me, Mr Clifford. - Thanks. You know... bit of bird trouble. Supposed to be there... rather be here. We've all been through it, sir. Don't worry, it's on it's way. - Thank you. - Thank you. I want you to send some flowers for me. Where to, sir? Seventeen, Richmond Grove. Well it's clear enough... 'With thanks for all your kindness', James Clifford. But I've never even heard of him. You must have. One of the boys from the university? Roses? That lot? I know what they expect for a bar of chocolate! What, and don't they ever get it then, love? Or don't you like chocolate? Not even a little nibble? He, he, he. Roses then, eh? I'll begin to hear the patter of tiny feet. Ha, ha. All I can hear is the patter of tiny minds! Ha, ha, ha, ha... Still... it's 'ere to stay, you know. So you keep reminding us. Well why not? It's on me mind, love. It's like I keep telling these long-haired directors... if you want me to sell your crummy films, I say... you've gotta give it a a good dose of'S and V'. That's what the public wants. Sex and violence. Cartoon, ice cream, the old'S and V'... and they're happy. What do you say Professor? - Me, Mr Henderson? - Yeah. Ah... well in my country, 'S and V' used to mean... - 'Shoot the Viceroy'. - Ha, ha, ha. Today it means a population explosion... and food riots. And both seem to call forward a strength, Mr Henderson. A rare quality. Yeah, maybe. But I tell you one thing... you'll never make it unpopular! Ha, ha, ha. Oh well, if you'll excuse me, Mrs Harper... I have some studies. Of course. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Susan. Goodnight, Shashie. You can't really talk to them, can you? No sense of humour. Don't be discouraged... He's probably up there laughing his head off. Mmm... chilly! Yes, well I think I'll, erm... I'll bowl down the local and have one with the lads. Coming? See you later, then. Did you have to? What? Make him feel small? He is small, Mum! He's awful. He is human, and he pays. He gets good value. What do you mean by that? Oh, Mum... Well come on, what? Now look here, Susan... you come home three times a year... and I tell you, I'm very glad of a little company in this house. Someone with a little life. Alright, so he enjoys a good laugh... what's wrong with that? Look, Mum... I don't give a damn what he enjoys in this house, or on the house, for that matter. The only thing on this house, my girl... is your education. I'd have sold this damn barn of a place years ago... if it hadn't been for that. I know, Mum. I'm sorry. Only one more year. That's all. Yeah... then what? Forty, snotty-nosed little kids to look after. Big deal! Hmm. Big enough. And not for you. With your face, and your figure... you could be a model. Ahh, now... look at that Twiggy and The Shrimp. More like a couple of growing boys... and they made a fortune! Well I'm more like a growing girl... so I couldn't, could I? I think I'll take these up with me. You won't want to take books to bed with you forever. I was married when I was your age. I know. Was a love-match wasn't it. 'Til someone blew it out. The only thing your father ever blew were his chances. He didn't have to go to Africa. He had a fine practice here. Well... maybe he wanted something he couldn't get on the National Health. Yeah... black women! And he wasn't very much good with white, I can tell you that. Oh Mum... be fair. We both know why he walked out. If I had kicked your father where he deserved... he'd have never have walked again! Now, who on earth can that be? S'alright, I'll go. Yes? Hello. Well... who do you want? Susan, please. Who is it? It's for you. Georgie! What's this? Well you better come in. You're soaked. Please. Are you Susan's Mummy? Yes... yes, I am. Who are you? Oh, this is Georgie. Err... Clifford. Oh... oh, so you're the flower man? No, Mum. His father is. Come here, Georgie. Go in and sit by the fire for a moment... will you? Get dry. Now who is he? He looks a bit, erm... Simple. That's all. Here. Read this. 'Dear Susan Harper... ' 'My son has told me of your kindness... ' 'and I am glad to hear that he can stay with you... ' 'as a paying guest. ' 'He has money and will be no trouble. ' 'I shall be abroad for a week... ' 'and hope to thank you in person on my return. ' 'In the meantime, I am sending you some roses... ' 'from Georgie and me. ' 'Sincerely, James Clifford. ' 'P.S. Bedtime nine-thirty, please. ' Whh.. at? What on earth are you thinking of, he can't stay here! I never said he could! Quick! Phone the hotel, tell his father. Yes. Well I... I'm sorry, mister, erm... Georgie. Georgie. Well I'm sorry, Georgie... I'm afraid you can't stay with us... we've nowhere to put you. You're like Susan... you're pretty. Erm... where's your father gone, Georgie? Oh, do sit down. Yes, that's right. Mr James Clifford. I'll just make sure... one moment, madam. Hello? No madam, Mr Clifford checked-out this morning. Caught a plane to Paris. No, madam... he never left an address. Oh. I see. Thank you. Gone. Oh, dear. And I've just been telling Georgie... we can't put him up, there's no room. Where will you go? Georgie's alright. We better 'phone for a taxi. You'll never get one in this weather. I... I can try. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Georgie. I'm terribly sorry, Georgie... but if only we'd known earlier... we could have arranged something. And if only your father had 'phoned yesterday... or the day before... I'm sure we could have managed something, but... but at this short notice, absolutely impossible. There isn't an empty bed in the house. Oh dear, just look at that rain! I really am so terribly sorry. Goodbye. Bye. Mum, we can't! Couldn't he have my old room? I'm not getting lumbered. Thank you very much! But just for tonight, couldn't he? Are you out of your mind? What sort of father... sends a boy like that... to a place like this, that he hasn't even seen?! Well, for all he knows this could be a brothel! Oh, please. He'll be no trouble, Mum. Please. Oh, alright. And if he wets the bed, you wash the sheets! Georgie! Georgie! Come on back! We can't let you go out in this weather. Come on. I'll take this. Those cases must be heavy. Mum thinks we can manage after all. You're gonna have my old room, right at the top. It'll be in a bit of a mess I expect. But you won't mind that, will you, Georgie? Hang on a minute. Thank you. Sweet dreams. Here we go. You're supposed to be in bed by now, aren't you? Huh... you'll have to have a hot bath first, though. You're absolutely drenched! Alright, Clarkie... I heard you. I was wondering... I've been beating this going longer than J. Arthur Rank! Your breakfast's cold. Sorry. Good morning. - Hello, Susan. - Morning. Hell, I'm late again! Mr Groom's going to take the pants off me. What time will that be, love? For you, Mr Henderson? A waste of time! Ahh, what a shame. Did mother tell you about our visitor? Yes, she did. A bit soft, she said. No... like a little boy. If you see him, Shashie, be nice to him, will you? Yes, of course. Oh, I must dash. Bye. Bye. Time somebody was nice to her! She'll be begging for it by the time she's forty. Late tonight, Clarkie. Tell mum for me, will you? I'll tell 'er you've 'ad no breakfast! Make sure you 'ave lunch. Bye. Oh... so you're Georgie. Go and get your breakfast. Thank you. Good morning. Ah! Georgie! Well, come on in, lad. Sit down. We won't eat ya. I'm Gerry and this is the, err... 'The Professor'. Mr Kumar. Hello, Georgie. He'll do the Indian Rope Trick if you ask him nicely. Tea of coffee, Georgie? Tea, please. Dad's in Paris, eh? Yes. - Seeing the sights. - Yes. I'll bet he is! Oh, come on... eat your egg up, boy. That's it. Specially laid by Donald Duck. Tea, Georgie. Thank you. You like the movies, do you? What about Batman? 'Batman is a Fatman'! Oh, who do you like then? - Tarzan. - Oh, Tarzan! Whoh... - Yaeeahheyaa! - Ha, ha, ha... Alright... don't bust a gut, mate! Ha, ha, ha... Well... err... yeah... the Professor can tell you all about Tarzan... err, that's where he comes from, the jungle. Tarzan was the son of an English Lord, Georgie. - Was he? - Mmm hmm. Who else would want to swing through trees... with a bunch of apes, hmm? Get out of it! Well, I must be off to the hospital. Bye, Georgie. I'm off too. - Burrrp! - Ha, ha, ha... Blimey... you'll be alright, lad. You... you just keep laughing! Oh, thank you. Can you put them in the sink? You don't have to do that, you know? Georgie can wash up. So I can see. Who taught you? Mummy. Where is she, Georgie? Have you stripped the boy's bed, Clarkie? It's been made. I thought you done it. Made? Room's a picture... windows open, clothes put away... pyjamas under the pilla. I wish the others were as neat and tidy! Georgie! I'm just going shopping... will you be alright? Goodnight. Goodnight, Georgie. No reading in bed, mind. Georgie! Still here? - Yes... 'night, Susan. - Goodnight. - Hello, Mum. - Hello, Darling. I thought he was going? Oh, how could we. You're quite right... he'll be no trouble. No trouble at all. Henry, listen to this... 'Dear Mummy... ' 'The flight was fine' 'and Paris is trs belle'. Thank you. 'But will not stay here as I have decided to travel around a bit. ' 'Will write again soon. Love, Marty. ' 'P.S. I will be thinking of Dad on Friday,' 'when he speaks at the banker's dinner. ' Nah... how about that! 'Wish him luck, he may need it!'. Fancy remembering that. - Yeah. - In that sweet of him? Very. Very. Well, I suppose I better learn the damn thing! - More coffee, Darling? - Yes, please. 'Your Royal Highness... ' 'My Lord, My Lord Mayor... ' Young man... the library has been closed for the last ten minutes. - I know. - Well then... Rat face. Eh... what was that?! Get lost! - Goodnight, Mr Groom. - I... Bye, bye. Think he's taken a liking to you. Yes. He has. I got you that book on Paris. Hi... sexpot! Philip! I was gonna 'phone you this evening. Then I saved you the money. Jump in. Why, what's on? Come on, don't waste time. Judy and Mac are waiting. - What for? - Us. Why? They want to talk about tomorrow. So long, buster. Oh, Georgie... I am sorry. Here, take this. See you later. What did I understand you to say to me in there? I said... - get... stuffed! - Huh! Who's the pretty boy? Yes he is rather, isn't he? Fancy him? Ha, ha! This is the centre of Paris, Georgie. I expect your father... would be staying in one of these hotels around here. Look, Georgie... here's the Champs-Elyses. And there's the Arc de Triomphe. They built that after Napoleon won all those battles. And at the other end... is the Place de la Concorde... and, err, over here... where is it? Oh yes... here, in Les Invalides... is where they buried him. - Georgie... - Yes, Mummy? Nine-thirty, Georgie. Bedtime. Oh. And I'm gonna make a cup of chocolate. For me? - If you want one. - In bed? Ha, ha! You're getting spoiled, aren't you? Goodnight. Thought you might like a cuppa. Mmm, I would. Medicine can be rather dry stuff. There you are then. Thank you. What's that? I was just wondering. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh, it's you! Having a race? Winning? Georgie always wins! Good. Then come and get your prize. Now I lay me down to sleep... and pray the Lord my soul to keep. And if I die before I w... wake... I... Pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen! Don't spill it, will you? Sweet dreams. Hello, good evening, from Manchester... let's take a quick look at some of the couples... who'll be dancing in this contest tonight... between the North and the South. And first of all here, couple number four... the very popular Martin Charles... and his lovely partner Barbara. Now these two, they were runners up last year... so they must stand a very good chance this time. And that magnificent dress that Barbara's wearing (there's seventeen yards of tulle in it, she tells me) it's a combined effort of Barbara and her Mum. And I gather that Mum sat up all night... sewing on those hundreds of sequins... which set off the whole ensemble. Really quite something, I think you'll agree. Now then, let's watch them for a moment... as the contest opens with... the waltz. Susan! It's Philip... quickly, he's in a call box. Damn! Coming! Bloody good speech H.D. Never heard better! Did you see the Royal's face... when I told the one about the pony and the polo stick? Did I? Everyone did! Do you know where I got it? No? My secretary. Miss Pym? Yes! Sixty, if she's a day. Ha, ha, ha, ha. How about that! Here... here don't worry, drop me at your place... I can walk around the corner. - Sure? - Quite. Could do with a spot of fresh air. Right. Thanks for the lift, H.D. Great evening! - Thanks again for the speech. - Night, Tom. - Goodnight. - See you tomorrow. Yes. Hello, who's that? Who is that? That you, Johnson? Guess again. Oh, Martin. You're back. Well, what's happened... you in trouble again? I'm not. Look, take that damn thing out of my eyes, will you. Here show me the light switch. Sure. You are in trouble, aren't you? Come on, let's get indoors. Thought it was too good to be true. Hey! Dad! Errrghh! Ugh! Argh! Uh! Err! Ahh... Uhh! And how about... that! He, he, he... 01773268, Private Henderson, Sir! Alright girly... I'm back. Ready and willing. Just hope I'm able. You're late. Please... Hmm? Gerry? Who is it?! Georgie! What are you doing here? Whad'ya want? Bad men! They bury Georgie in the sand. Couldn't breath! It's alright. It's alright, Georgie. It's only a dream. Quite safe now. Mummy... Georgie, you're burning! Here... You'll catch cold. Lie still for a moment. - Mmm... - It's alright, it's alright... Just lie still. Joan? Joan?! Allo... what's cooking? Spot of the dark meat, eh? Joan! Now then, Sue... no hanky-panky in the back seat! You needn't worry, I shall be in the front seat. Well watch out for his hand when he changes gear, then! - Hi - Ha, ha, ha. Jump in. Ah, good morning, Mr Henderson. Morning. Most marvellous day, is it not? Yeah. The night wasn't so dusty either, was it? The night? What happened? Eh?! What happened? Transcendental Meditation, was it? A little Yogi Pogi? Or were you practicing all those Oriental, spiritual exercises... cross-legged on the floor? Or 'somewhere'?! Have you got her on pot yet? Pot? Well, I'm sorry, I don't think I understand. You're a dark one, you are. Meaning what, Mr Henderson? Oh... no offence, no offence. No, no, I must say, you had me fooled. So you're getting a cut off the joint as well, are you? Cut off the joint?! Come off it... from 'Lady Bountiful' here. Oh, Mr Henderson... I begin to see what's on your mind! It's not very gracious to the lady concerned. In any case, were she like that... I would like to remind you that... we Hindu's are forbidden to eat cow. Yours is just coming up Mr Henderson. Alright, love. Mrs Harper's doing something special for you son... so sit down. I wouldn't read that if I was you. Won't want to touch a thing after that. Horrible! Oh! Banker brutally murdered. 'Henry Durnley found stabbed'. 'Multiple stomach wounds'. Banker, eh? Well, that's closed his account! There's none of us safe these days, if you ask me. Not since they give up hanging. No, and we won't be 'til they bring it back either. You mark my words! Mind you, they say he might be one of these... oh, what do ya call 'em... 'Psychopratts'. 'Psychopaths', Mrs Clark? That's it! I don't give a damn what his religion is... I'd top 'im! But if he is a psychopath, he's a very sick man. Who says so? I'll tell you something... tha... that's an argument that makes me sick! What about... this, err... Durnley chap. What about feeling sorry for him then, eh?! Look, of course I feel sorry for him... it's easy when a man's dead. It's easy when a man's blind or deaf, or lost a limb. You can see it. But how about a man who can feeling nothing for anyone... except for himself? Who doesn't know what love is... or pity, who has no conscience. Who's only feeling is of rage, when frustrated. And only fun, destroying those who frustrate him. Now, it's hard to feel sorry for him, isn't it? - Oh, dear. - Yet, he is really sick... he's diseased. And there very few of us who can help him. Sphericals! If he's off his trolley, I still say 'top 'im'! Here we are. Morning everyone. - Morning. - Good morning. Morning. - Here you are, Georgie. - Thanks. Eat it all up now, it'll make you strong. Fresh toast, Shashie? Most kind, Mrs Harper. Oh, Georgie... I'll be ready in about an hour. Ok. Hey...! You're not so backward, are you, son? Pardon? So you've got two then? Two what? Eggs, of course. Oh, yes. - Sleep well last night? - Mmm. Yeah. I bet you did! Where's Susan gone to? Gawd... blimey! You're a bit of a glutton, aren't you, son?! You'll be asking for old Clarkie next. When's it gonna be her turn?! - I see... - Oh. Sorry. I... Going in for bodybuilding now then, are you? Hmm? Building up his strength? Oh. Yeah. Huh! Making quite a fuss of him, aren't you? Well, why not? Bit strong, isn't it? What is? With a half-wit!? Your jokes are getting a bit stale, Gerry. And... everything else as well. Is that it? Well, now you come to mention it. Oh look here, Gerry. I think you better leave. What? Shall we say a week? You can say what you bloody well like! What does it mean 'top him'? Oh. It's an old... British remedy, Georgie. Admired by those who find it... easier to kill... than to... cure. Right, lets get some light on it. Yes... that's about it. How 'bout the footprints, Tom? Rubber soles. Eight and a half. His missus says this door's always kept locked. So looks as though who ever it was... was waiting for him over there. That lock been forced? No, Sir. Oh no, here comes the brain drain! Stay where you are, you. - Morning, Taffy. - Morning, Superintendent. Brought your crystal ball? What do you see? Well, Sir... deceased died of multiple injuries inflicted by a sharp instrument. Time, approximately midnight. Contents of stomach... oysters, white fish, possibly halibut... Yes, I don't want the menu... just give me the weapon. The walls of the lower abdomen... have been punctured three times to a depth... I said weapon! Scissors. Tell you what... double or quits this isn't a pro job. You on? I'm getting old, Super... saving for retirement. That raincoat... anything? Oh yes, Sir... plastic, new, large size... mass produced, colour grey... Yes, I'm not colour-blind. Blood stains, group 'O', rhesus-positive... identical with deceased. - That the lot, Taffy? - Yes, Sir. And I left my brains on the beat! What have you fellows got? Electromagnifiers, computers, memory banks... ultraviolet, supersonic microwave machines. They buy you a half-million pound lab and stick you in it... with a bunch of birds wearing skirts just long enough... to cover their parking meters... and what do you come up with? No more than my nipper could 'ave told me the day he was... old enough to raise his... truncheon! Give me that! And get on your feet, that man, whad'ya think you are... the sleeping bloody beauty! Yes? Sorry to trouble you again. Doctor, do you mind? I'd like Mrs Durnley to get some sleep. What is it? It's this raincoat, Ma'am. Ever seen it before? No. You're quite sure? Yeah. Oh, there was just one other thing. Does anyone else have keys to the garage? Thompson. My son, Martin. Myself. Thompson, Ma'am... staff? No, from the mews... he washes the cars. I see. And your son? He's away. Perhaps you chaps could help us there? He's in France, somewhere. Should be here with his mother. Well hasn't anyone heard from him? Oh, yes. We had a sweet letter from him. Made his father so happy. Mmm. He doesn't say where he's going, eh? Well, we'll have to see what we can do. I'll leave you to rest now, Mrs Durnley. Thank you, Doctor. - Superintendent... - Ma'am? If... if nothing was was stolen... no money taken... why? Why?! Well that's what we hope to find out, Ma'am. ...see the wife's mother. Her night off. I see. What was he like, your boss? Alright. No frills. One of us, really. Sounds like my boss, he's got no frills. No bleedin' heart either. It's first time I've been off my feet all week! On duty, Sergeant Rogers? Err... yes, Sir. So I see. Let's 'ave it. - You made this? - My wife, Sir. Well you wanna look after her... it's a good cuppa. That young Durnley? Yes, Sir. A nice looking lad. Yes, Sir. This is gonna come as quite a blow to him. Yes, Sir? Well, won't it? Yes, Sir. He, he, he. Young Mr Martin's parting gift. What this? Quite a joker, that lad. Oh... great sense of humour. For those who understand it. Oh quick, that man... get him back for me, will you? Yes, Sir. Err... yes, Sir? Ahh... Rogers... You're doing a fine job! Finish your tea. Hey! Come on! Sue... Let's blow. Where to? I'm easy. Your room? Don't be a drag, Philip! My place then? Why not? Don't want. You've never tried. Philip, you're stoned! Put me to bed, then. Look... you can sleep it off, or have it off... but not with me! Night, Susan. You bloody idiot you! God, it's a complete right-off! What the hell were you up to?! I saw that... bastard did it on purpose! What?! I ought to... stuff this down your bloody throat! Philip! Stop it! It's alright, Georgie. Couldn't be helped. You get off to bed. That's it. Goodnight. Couldn't be helped?! You heard what Mac said. Mac could be mistaken. Well... it's been a long day. Party's over. Party? There you are, Philip... send me the bill. Mac, you'd better drive. Ok. Come on, Judy. Thanks a lot. Goodnight. Well err... see you tomorrow then? No. But we're going swimming. I am. Got you. So, when do I see you again then? Next term. Perhaps. If you're carrying field glasses. They're waiting for you, Philip. Oh... alright! And thanks... for nothing! Come on, Georgie! Oh, it's freezing! I've had enough. Race you back. One, two, three... go! Susan! Help! Help! Help! Oh! Oh! Ever been had!? Oh... you cheat! Let me get you... Oh, I nearly died of fright. Oh, it's cold! Here, dry yourself. Get dressed. Quickly. Like it here? - Super! - Yes. Dad and I used to come here quite a lot in the old days. Georgie! You'll get us locked-up, Georgie. I'd better get decent too. - No one's here. - But I am! Any brothers or sisters, Georgie? A brother. Pete. Where's he? Australia. On a sheep farm. He's the boss. Does he look like you? Girls like him. He's big. Strong. Plays the guitar too. Sounds quite a swinger. I'd like to meet your brother Pete. Yes. He'd marry you. Huh! Oh, Georgie! Oh, Georgie... how lovely! Thank you. How sweet of you. Georgie! Don't you ever do that again! ...lay back upper two, lay back... ...drop your wrists four. You're late. That's better. One step, two step, three step... four step, five step, six step... Sorry, Susan. Let's forget it, Georgie. I dare say it was my fault, really. I'll get these things packed up. Well come on, take hold of the other end. Any cigarettes? You're just putting one out. Alright. What's the matter with you this morning... you're as jumpy as a kitten? Nothing. You know, when Gerry leaves... I think I'll move Georgie. - Mum! - Mmm? I think it's time Georgie went too. Why? Because it's too great a responsibility. Oh, what is? Thinking we could cope. We don't know enough. Well there's nothing to know. He's just a child. He may talk like a child... but look at him, Mum. Look at him! I have. But he's a man! As a matter of fact, he slept down here the other night. He what?! Like a child. Hadn't you heard? Oh... so that's what Gerry was sniggering about! He had a nightmare. He was frightened. He wanted his mum. Nothing else. Could have been your father! There's an awful lot of waste in this world, isn't there? There's an awful lot to understand. Mrs 'arper! Yes, Clarkie? It's for Georgie, from Paris. Well that'll be his father. Shall I take it? No it's alright, I'm going down... Oh do the boy's bedroom will you Darling, it's Clarkie's half-day. Mmm... ok. Hello? No I'm sorry, Georgie's out at the moment. Is that his father? Oh... hello, Mr Clifford! No, no, this is Mrs Harper. We were beginning to think you didn't exist! Yes, yes, Georgie's very well... we've all grown very fond of him. Oh, that's very nice of you to say so, thank you. I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that... would you repeat it? I said my work's almost finished... and I'd like Georgie to join me. It's time he had a holiday. That was his father on the 'phone. You needn't have worried... he won't be here much longer. Good. Yes, I thought you'd say that. This the lad's? Yes, Clarkie. - Mum... - Mmm... Has Georgie every mentioned anyone named Durnley? Who? Martin Durnley. No, why? That was that man's name, wasn't it? Durnley? You know... one they said was done it in by a psychopratt. Now don't you go pulling out all them old papers... I want them for me fires. It's all they're fit for, most of 'em. What are you looking for? Just something I remember reading. - Mum. - Mmm? I'm going into London. London? But you haven't got time. But hey, what about the library... you're supposed to be there at one! Yes, I remember the incident very clearly. I'm sure we did take his name... we always do you know. Should be in here somewhere. Let me see. Yes, I thought so. Here we are. Oh, do come in. That chair, nurse. Susan, isn't it? That's right. Please sit down. Thank you. Mrs Durnley, I came to talk to you about Georgie. Georgie? Isn't he sometimes called 'Georgie'? Who is? Your son. My son's name is Martin. Oh. Is he here? No, he's away. Do you know where? Naturally. Somewhere I could 'phone him? It's rather difficult. It's very important to me. He's in France. France? Travelling. Mrs Durnley, you're quite sure of that? Yes of course I'm sure. Hello, Georgie. Where's Susan? Out. Oh. You want to make yourself useful... I need some more firewood, there's a good boy. Look, what is all this about? You seem very anxious. I am. Well then, hadn't you better come out with it? Well, I'm not sure. Not absolutely sure that I can, yet. Miss Harper, you're not in some sort of trouble, are you? Trouble? Well if you are, you must be quite frank about it. You wouldn't be the first girl that... Oh no... at least, not in that way. Then what are you here for? Mrs Durnley... I don't quite know how to say this, but... I have to ask... Is your son handicapped in any way? What do you mean?! Forgive me but... Is Martin... mentally backward? Retarded? Martin, retarded?! Certainly not! He's a perfectly normal, healthy boy! I don't know what your little game is... or what you hope to get out of this, but I certainly don't want to listen to any more of it. You must go now. Please! I'm sorry. I never meant to upset you. And thank you for seeing me. Goodbye, Mrs Durnley. Don't go! Please! I'm sorry. Tell me, why did you come here today? Do you know where he is? Mrs Harper? I'm off, then. Alright, Clarkie. See you tomorrow. That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, possibly the most important scientific discovery... of the last century. The chromosome. Invisible to the naked eye, what we are, how we look, indeed in some cases what we become, depends on the number, and nature, of these little blighters. We get... twenty-three from mum, twenty-three from dad. Forty-six, in all. And... God help us if anything goes wrong with them. Now then, I want you to look at the chromosomes... of a normal person. Afterwards, I shall want you to look at those of someone... who appears to be normal. Hello, Susan. What brings you here? Oh Shashie, I'm sorry, but I must have a word. Is there somewhere we can talk? Yes, of course. Come on. We can talk in here. Now, the abnormal. Do you see? The abnormality is here. A translocated fusion. Part of one chromosome has split off, and fused with another. There is now a one in three chance, that any child produced, will be... ...a Mongol. That's what his brother really is. Not a sheep farmer in Australia. Hmm, rough. Yes. But that wasn't all. In most cases, bad luck. An accident of nature. The next child... perfectly normal. But, if the fusion is permanent, and a blood test will show, then we have to warn the unfortunate person... no more children. They might just as well have told her not to breath. So she went ahead, did she, and had Martin. Oh dear, oh dear. She's so lost, so lonely, Shashie. She didn't love, she worshipped him. Fed him, washed him, dressed him. There wasn't anything she didn't do for him. And everyday of his life... she searched him. Searched for signs. The shape of his eyes, and the palms of his hands, and the soles of his little feet. All the time, scared to death at what she might find. Now... let me impress on you, any relatives of a Mongol... are usually as normal as you or I. If they're not, it has nothing to do with Mongolism. One in every seven hundred is born a Mongol, but, ten times that number, roughly, one in every hundred, suffers from other forms of mental disturbance. I find myself asking, is it really the home, the environment, the way a person is brought up, that creates the... neurotic, the psychopath, the psychotic? Or could it be some... error in the chromosome structure? Working beyond the compass... of our most powerful microscope, could the poet have devined the truth... before science, when he wrote; 'No puppet master... ' 'pulls the strings on high. ' 'A twisted nerve,' 'a ganglion gone awry,' 'Predestinates the sinner... ' 'or the saint. ' Still at it, Georgie? You are working hard. Be careful, that's very sharp. I've just put the kettle on, come and have a cup of tea. Where's Susan gone to? London. I've got a surprise for you, Georgie. Guess who 'phoned? Daddy. He wants to take you away, Georgie. I shall miss you. When you go and Susan's back at school, I shall be alone. Will you miss me? When's she coming back? Susan? She didn't say. Oh yes, that reminds me... what was it now she was so anxious to know... Oh yes, had you ever mentioned anyone called 'Durnley'? Yes, that was the man's name... 'Durnle... ' Georgie! Georgie, you've cut yourself... oh you poor boy! Use your handkerchief. What did she say? You better come up to my room and let me see to it... What did she say, she say, say...? About the Durnleys? Oh 'Martin', that was his first name, I've just remembered. Who is he, Georgie... hmm? Who is he, this 'Martin'? I wonder if he's anything to do with that murder. His name was Durnley. What is it? You're trembling. It's alright. Tell Mummy all about it. I'll teach her, teach her, teach her... What's the matter? What is it? Take your filthy hands off... ME! You're mad! She wants me to send him back. Well? Shashie, I'm scared. What is he, schizo, or something? Autistic, more likely. Rather stay a child, a baby, if he could. And with a mother like that, feeding him a daily diet of her anxieties... I don't wonder at it. I tell you what I've been wondering... that night his father died, did he really have that nightmare? Oh... sorry, Sir. They want Harold and Mary, here, for the next show. Alright. What do I do? You come with me. Morning, gentlemen. - Morning, Sir. - All ready for a trip 'round the bay? Where's the Maharaja? Ahh, Kumar. You with us today? Err... sorry, Sir John. Just coming. There you are, see what you chaps can pick up... in a teaching hospital! - Ha, ha, ha. - Come on. Well he usually goes around like a dose of salts. So I shan't be long. But when you go back, I'm going with you, understand? - Thank you, Shashie. - Good. Oh, nurse... is there a 'phone? - On the ground floor. - Oh damn! Really? - Is it urgent? - Yes. Look, Sister's in casualty, use hers. - Oh could I? - If you're quick about it... but don't tell her her I told you! Thank you. This telephone is for staff use only! Sorry, Sister. Fourpence, please. There was no reply. Thank you. Let's ask the Maharaja. He's good with the girls. Diagnosis, please. Uhm... The character of the abdominal pains, suggests an infection of the lower intestine. Oh no, it's not that. It isn't? No... it's them pills the black nurse give me. I've been on the bed pan ever since. - You have? - Yes. I'm on it now! In that case we better leave you. Mum? Mum? Anyone at home? Mum? Are you down there? Mum! Hello? Hello, Susan? Oh, it's you, Shashie. Did you get my note? - I nearly got heart failure! - Yes I'm sorry... but I'd forgotten it was Clarkie's half day... and I didn't want Mum to be alone here. Are you alright? Yes, I'm alright. Is your mother there? No, she's out. No sign of anyone. Good! Now if he does show... keep out of his way. I'm leaving as soon as I can. Yes, Doctor! - Bye. - Goodbye. Uhh! Gerry! Yoike! It's you! Well, it's not a bloody Ghost! You look as if you're expecting one. You're early. Well... I'm drunk! Celebration? What, yeah... yeah... well I said I'd do it, and I've done it! You call 'em 'films', I said. 'Films'?! 'Celluloid manure', that's more like it! I... gave it to 'em... the whole script. Uncut.. in new over.. 3D and.. stereo.. le.. phonic sound... and... there was no interval for refreshments, either! Ha, ha, ha... What did they say? You're fired! Fired? Oh... dear! Ha, ha! 'oh dear'... that's very good... yes.. ha, ha... He, he... twelve years... twelve years I've been... kissing their backsides and now... I'm out on mine! Lost me job... lost my home... Ahh... And I've lost my senses by the look of it as well! Let me make you some coffee. Oh... Make you feel better. No, not just now... thanks, love. Have you got an aspirin? Soon get some. - Huh! - Don't scream! Hello, Susan. Hello, Georgie. Sur... surprised you. Didn't I? Yes... I was just getting some aspirin for Gerry. He's downstairs. Better stay there. You've had a busy day. Yes. Visiting? Yes. Anyone I know? You hurt your hand. It's ok. Your mum saw to it. Before she went out. How's... m... mm... mmm... my old lady? She wants you back. Martin. Yeah. I've got other ideas. And we're a bit pushed. Put that on. Why? You want to look your best, don't you? What for? Getting married. Go ahead... Put it on... Susan! He bribed a porter to post that letter. We know that. He never went to Paris. We know that. Now, where's he hiding? And why? Ever thought about death? Dream it? It's like swimming. Only, there's no one there to pull you out. There will be time for everything, with a bit of luck. You cant help what you dream. Can you? You can't. And it's all night long. All night. Sleep well, my Darling? Yes thank you, Mummy. Some dreams you don't have to be asleep for. Like the ones about you. They'd surprise you. Would you like a surprise, Susan... first? Sit down. No! No, not there. Here. Oh... Ooh... No... bloody wood! Do you know what I dreamt you'd do then, Susan? Do you? Do you? Listen to this. Listen...! It has to be slowly. Very slowly. You... pull me over you. Right over you. I can feel your knee pressing beneath me and it's... hard. And when the nurse brought him in... and gave him to me... the doctor said... 'you can stop worrying'... 'you've been lucky'... 'he's not a Mongol'. Can you understand... can you imagine how I felt, Susan? I wept. He was so beautiful. A miracle! That's how I wanted to keep him. A baby. In my arms, forever. I've waited so long, you see. That's why it has to be slowly. Slowly. Only, if a man asked a girl that... she'd laugh, wouldn't she? I wouldn't laugh, Georgie. You wouldn't? Alright then, Susan. Take it. Go on. Take it. Take it! No, Georgie! Why not?! Tell me! Why not!? Shh! There you are, listen. Like wedding bells. Now, Susan. Now! I can't, I tell you! I can't! Then why pretend you could!? Why!? You've got to now, do you hear? Do you hear? GOT TO! - No! - ARRRGGHHH! Meurgh... Uurgghhh... Here, put it on. We're going. You go. No, us... us, us, us, US! I'm not going. Not with you, Martin. With Georgie, then. Georgie. No! You're going to kill me anyway. Oh, damn! - Who is it? - It's me, Shashie! Ohh... thank God! Hey, what's wrong? What's the matter?! - In the shed. - Uh? It's horrible! In the shed. No! Have you called the police? Yeah.. well.. I was just gonna fetch them. Where's Susan? - She was here. - Susan! Don't you let him, Georgie! Don't let him! She may have gone out to buy some aspirin. Well quickly take a look downstairs. Have you gone bloody mad? He might be down there! I don't wanna get chopped. Hello, Police? Help me! Help me! Oh! Oh... damn! Help me. Help me. Don't! Don't! Please, Georgie. Please. You're like all the others... others... others. No! No, Georgie! Nooo...! Help! Now watch ya step. This chap's a nutter! Yes you are! All the same! All of you! Martin's dead. He's been bad. N... not Georgie. Bad... bad Marty! And now... I lay me down to sleep, pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I die before I wake... if I die before I... wake... Get 'im! Susan? Susan. Susan. Susan. Susan. Susan... Susan... "A twisted nerve, a ganglion gone awry, Predestinates the sinner... or the saint. " Susan. Susan. Susan. Susan.
