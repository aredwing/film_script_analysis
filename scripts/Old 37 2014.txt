I have those same boxers. Thank you, Rachel. Got new movies. God, I love your mouth. Let's go. Nice underwear. Real sexy. (LAUGHS) Later, flapjacks. Hey, Jason. Nice day, huh? Oh, what's on your lip? It's a huge whore. Did I hear you talking to somebody out there? No. Here's your mail. Thank you, baby. I thought maybe it was Angel. Yeah. I don't think so. What happened? Nothing. She's too busy with her new friends. I have too much going on, though, anyway. Yes, you do. Have to get your essay in their hands by the 15th. (SIGHS) My ticket out of this town, thank God. Hey, Mom, do you think dad would have loved you if you were like deformed or had flapjacks or something? What? I don't know. Never mind. What would make you ask that, sweetie? Nothing, nothing. Just drop it. Of course, your father would have. He did. That's why he married me and not that bimbo Judy DeZulla. Okay, Mom, we can't all be as beautiful as you are. Honey, I'm sure whatever is going on with you and Angel is just a phase. What's his sudden interest in you anyway? I mean, he only likes skanks like Brooke. Well, I guess I'm a skank then. Because he likes me. And I like him. Brad? I mean, come on. He's such an asshole 'roid head. Amy, he's not! He's really nice. If you would just give him a chance... No, thanks. I'd rather die than hang out with those douchebags. Everything's always about you. Why can't you just be happy for me? Amy? What? Just drop it. (SCREAMING) (LAUGHS) - (TYRES SCREECHING) - (SCREAMING) Such a YouTube queen. I guess she is used to having her legs open, isn't she? Unbelievable. Whoo!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're okay, you're okay. 9-1-1. There's been an accident. (CRYING) We're gonna be in so much trouble! Don't worry. We'll be fine. We? What about her? Shit. (AMBULANCE SIREN WAILS) About fucking time. - Tim, come on, man! - What are we gonna say? What the fuck are you doing? Let's just say she fell. How'd the fuck would she fall out of a moving car? I don't know! She was always just goofing off like that. So she climbed out without anyone noticing? And just fell? I swear. - Dude, what happened? - It was an accident. You! You! (YELLING) It wasn't anyone's fault. It was an accident! Cut the crap. Breathe! Relax! What took you guys so long to get here? We got one ambulance covering 300 square miles. Do the math. AMY: In the past couple of months, Angel and I had grown apart. Not because we didn't want to see each other. But because she wanted to try new things and grow. Your hair looks so good. I know, right? The guy who does hair in Top Model did it. He's really good. Unreal. I'll remember her for the free spirit that she was and how she taught me the meaning of friendship. - Shut up! - It's awesome. It's a funeral, not a fashion show. I love you, Angel. I'm gonna miss you so much. (GIGGLES) You're so bad. That was beautiful. All right now. I'm going to get you out of here. But first, a few words about automobile safety from Sergeant Higgins. I feel sick. That's because you're drinking at 10:30 in the morning. Shut up! Thank you, Principal Stockton. Obviously, not my favorite part of the job. Statistics show that vehicle crashes are the number one cause of death in this country. So I know you're out there having a good time. And you're texting. And you're jamming. And you're rockin' out to the radio. But let me tell you something, by the time I get there, the fun is over and what I see is not so pretty. So could you please just keep in mind, please, that a car is not a toy. Hey, good job in there. It was really nice. I'm sorry. Thanks. Hey, Mary. Hey, Amy. I just wanted to personally give you my condolences. Those kids friends of yours too? Not at all. That's good because I think Angel would have fared a little bit better if she hadn't been friends with them either. Do you suspect that there is more to their story than... Following up on a couple of things. We're gonna go. Right. - See you soon. - Yeah. Oh, and, Amy, you need anything, don't hesitate to call day or night, okay? I always promised your father I'd watch after you. He would have done the same for me. Well, I'm fine. Okay. (CRYING) Keep me inside See you in time Wait by my side Wait for sunshine 'Cause it won't take long To get where you wanna go If you take it day by day, yeah, you take it slow Though the path is rough and you're carrying a heavy load Soon, you'll find your way onto the better road 'Cause it won't take long to get where you wanna go If you take it day by day, yeah, you take it slow... God damn it! Why does nothing work in this office? What's the problem? Stupid mouse. The mouse is stupid. Listen, by the way, there's this kid, Jordan Banks. He went away for the weekend and didn't check in with his mommy yet. Big surprise there. His mom's been up my dick hole like a goddamned kangaroo. Sounds painful. It is. I just don't get guys. I think they're all jerks. Some are, kid. (CHUCKLES) Not all of them. You got home late again last night. Mm-hmm. You and your new boyfriend must be having quite the time together. Archie's not my boyfriend. But thank you for asking. So do we have step dad material here or what? What are you doing? I'm sorry. I'm just... I miss Dad. I know. Me too. And now with Angel, I can't imagine. You know what I was thinking about the other day? What? Do you remember the July 4th Fair? Of course. - The fireworks? - The fireworks. (LAUGHING) They were so low and I was so lost. Daddy jumped on you like you were on fire. I just don't get what he sees in her. Who? Jason. Okay, if you like him so much, why don't you just ask him to chill? Chill, Mom? What? I can't say chill? No, you can. It's just... I just, um, I wanted to run something by you. - Okay. - (DOOR BELL RINGS) Hold that thought. I think I want a boob job. A boob job? I thought you were doing so well with your jazzercise tapes. It's cardio kickboxing, Mom. And it's not enough. But, baby, you're so beautiful the way you are. Can't we at least talk to Dr. Monroe? We'll talk about this in a bit, okay? (DOORBELL RINGS) Phil? Hi. Come on in. Thanks. What brings you by? Well, actually, I wanted to talk to Amy. So what do you know about Jordan Banks? That he's a walking STD? Amy! (CHUCKLES) All right. Any idea where he might be? No, not a clue. Why do you ask? Well, his folks filed a missing persons. And I didn't know if there was any word on the street as to his whereabouts. Hopefully, well, hopefully, there's nothing to be concerned about. We are hardly concerned. Amy, what has gotten into you? I can't stop thinking about Angel. Well, stop. What if somebody finds out? We could be in deep shit. Oh, the dead don't speak, J. Let it die. They did. How do you sleep at night? Naked. What is wrong with you? What's wrong with me is that you're acting like a little bitch. Brooke, this is serious. I'm sure your little friend, Amy, would love to know how serious it is. Are you kidding? You can't just threaten me. Oh, no? It's not your place to tell her anything. I can do whatever I want to do, okay? I'm laying here being all hot and stuff. And you're over there whining about all this bullshit! No, Brooke. I'm just sick of playing this game. (SIGHS) I gotta go. I'm gonna have to touch myself since you can't seem to handle it. - You're the Devil. - Bye, little bitch! Is that what you're gonna wear? No. Maybe just something you just slip easily on and off, yeah? This love was never easy But something's faded inside of your heart So you're crusading to tear us apart. Amy, you look to be a perfect candidate for breast augmentation. Great. Thank you, Dr. Monroe. Now, Mary, you know you can call me Dennis. Of course. You can call me anything you want. Just don't call me late for supper. (CHUCKLES) So how soon can we schedule? Oh, let me see. Looks like I have a cancellation on the 15th. Does that work? That's... Yes, I'll take it. Soon. We become everything We create aside Life is way Shadows that open our eye Your hair looks awesome. Thanks. Didn't want it to be too obvious. God, no, it's totally subtle. What's Jason wearing to the party? Oh, if I even invite him. Really? I guess Jordan's not gonna be there either. Now that he's missing. (CHUCKLES) Ugh, guys are so annoying. So are their mothers. She will not stop calling me. Zip it up, chatty. I am. I think it's about time that I hang out with Brad. I think he's perfection. He's kind of gay. He's not gay. It was a rumor. I started it. Oh! He's not gay. I'm sure you would know. Not yet. Skank. (CHATTERING) Growing up I was an outcast Never was quite satisfied Amy? Hey, Jason. How are you? I'm okay. MAN: What's up, Jason? So are you going to Brooke's? Yeah. Something I gotta take care of. Is there? Only one way to find out. Come with me. Come on. I'm flying away Feel the strain, feel the pain But I'll be okay, I'll be safe I'm flyin' away from a state of decay What a mess My princess Everything we made eroded away You say had enough, you say we're out of love But this is something that we both thought we could rise above You say you're missing me We're both in agony Or is it just the thought of someone else having me Have you heard from Jordan? His mom will not stop calling me. Yeah, same here. I thought she wanted to hook up with some of that young meat. Hey! I think he took that chick, Sam, to the Golden Gears Muscle Car Extravaganza! Wait? That little jail bait slut from the pizza place? - Yeah. - She's like 15 years old. Oh, but have you seen that ass? Gross, Spaz, gross. Excuse me? She's a nobody. She's a nobody. Ow, why do you keep doing that? See? It'll be fine, I promise. Let me go get us some drinks. Hey, Red Riding Hood. You lost? I think I'm gonna go. - You guys talking about me over here? - No. Oh, this should be a train wreck. Then maybe you were talking about Angel. And her "accident". - Brooke... - Oh, that's right. The loser sisters were friends. Yeah. Let's go. Hey, where you going? Yeah, well, not here. Later, J. What do you mean, "accident"? Don't put your fingers where they don't belong. - You might lose them. - What? Brooke, stop! You're drunk! The bitch thing is getting kind of old, all right? It's not the 80s anymore. Go drive your scooter into a tree and film it! Nobody would care, especially not Rachel! And you, Mr. Innocent. Don't act like Angel was your first. What? Tell me you and Jordan didn't leave that little old lady for dead in the woods. (SCREAMS) Oh, shit! Oh, my God! What'll we do? I'm getting the hell outta here. We have to wait for the police! - Fuck that! - We can't just leave her here! You wanna do five to ten for manslaughter, be my guest, pal! - Not me! - He's right, Jason. Look, she's old. She probably had a good life. We can't go to jail! Come on, let's go! Shit! Is it true? Baby, you better believe it's true. He's a real piece of shit. Just like the rest of us. I can't believe it. Why? 'Cause you loved him? (CRYING) Hey. Fuck, Brooke! - What? - What? You're gonna get us all arrested for starters! What is wrong with you? Anyways. Brad, it's Tim. Brooke has lost her shit, okay? She's just spewing words in front of everybody. Chaos. Call me back. (CELL PHONE RINGS) Are you gonna get that? Just ignore it. You want me? You know I do. You think I'm hot? Yeah. Tell me I'm hot. You're so fucking hot. Am I hotter than Brooke? Yeah, you're so hot. Yeah, but tell me I'm hotter than Brooke. You're hotter than Brooke. Yeah? (CLATTERING) Wait! What was that? I don't hear anything. Brad, seriously. What? Just look. I'm looking. Yeah, I don't see anything. Babe, don't worry. I'll protect you. She shouldn't have been running her mouth where she doesn't belong. How dare you bring her here, by the way! She's nice! Maybe you'd realize that if you could get over yourself! No wonder your parents hate you. Get the fuck out of my house! And don't come back till you're ready to treat me the way I deserve to be treated! I do treat you the way you deserve to be treated. It's so fucking hot in here. I'm ready to go now. Okay. Oh, fuck. (CHUCKLES) (SCREAMS) Rachel? Rachel? Rachel! (YELLING) - Bitch! - (WHIRRING) Rachel! Guys? Guys? Oh, shit. Rachel? Brad? Brad?
