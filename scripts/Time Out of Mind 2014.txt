Look, you're not listening to me. Aah! What are you doing? I can't do that. I'll kill him. I swear I'll kill him. I got diabetes. He don't care! He don't care! Can we get you somethin' to eat? He don't even got that. He don't respect me. They sent me from... They said come here. They said come here. He said go back. He said after one more night I can come back here I got diabetes. Damn it.

She didn't take it to court. She didn't do anything. Stupid cow. She knew I had no place to go. Okay, so no staying with the cow. How about family? You got a family? If I say I have a family does that mean I can still stay here? Yes, unless they'd be willing to take you in. I don't have a family. Okay, come on, darling... You would much rather stay with your family than stay here, you understand what I'm sayin'? Mr. Hammer, please, trust me on that one. Hammond, Hammond, George Hammond. Sorry, darlin'. I'll change that one. I just want a bed to sleep on. I don't have enough money to stay in a hotel. I don't have a family. You never married? Handsome man like yourself. I'm not handsome. Maybe I was. I was married once. Oh. She's no longer with me. Breasts. Um, excuse me? Breast. She had breast cancer. One. Then the other one. She's... she's, she died. She's gone. Sorry about that. It's okay. It's alright. We had been divorced for many years. How about children? You got any children? One. One girl. Oh. Daughter. She know you're here? Hmm? Give her a call? Yeah, daughters and daddy's special relationship. I love my daddy, sure did. He was... I just worshiped the ground he walked on. He could do no wrong in my eyes. He was a rock. I don't know where she is. I... haven't seen her in a while. Anyway she doesn't want me. She doesn't... She wouldn't want me. She's not one those daughters. She doesn't... adore me. She doesn't, uh, worship the ground I walk on. I... I didn't pay much attention to her. My mind was on somethin' else. On somethin' else? Like what? I'm just a fuck up. Probably always was. Alright. So are you and have you been addicted to any legal or illegal substances? And please don't lie. I just want a place to sleep, please. We will have to do a psychiatric evaluation. I'm addicted to sleep. ...and you will be evaluated with the social history within... I'm gettin' the idea, I don't feel like you want me to be here. 'Cause I'm feelin' like you... you want me to go away. I want what's best for you. You want what's, uh... You have no idea who I am. You don't know me. How can you possibly... How are you gonna know what's best for me? Why do you think I'm asking you all these questions? Look, I am starving, I... I need to sleep. I have no answers.

Why would I fuck with you? No, you fuck up, you go to next step shelter which is... you know, last step shelter really and then you're up shit creek without a paddle. And they can kick you out for a year. They can't deny you a bed if you don't fuck up. So you gotta learn to play their game. That's why I play it cool. I know you are not sleeping. What the hell is this? An Aryan nation brotherhood meeting? They don't give a shit who they let in these days. Why don't you pull up your pants? Why don't you go to hell? I thought you were asleep. I... I am asleep. Oh, you're asleep? I was... W... why did he say that? Oh, he's a fucking racist. That's why. Stop payin' attention to him. We got white people in this system. More than you think. Yeah, not more than them, but... Yeah, there's more of us on the street. That's the pride of the white man. Shelters are like prisons. You know, just a fucking rat in a cage. This place is shit. It's designed to be shit. You read the "Bible?" I read the "Bible. " "That which is crooked cannot be made straight. " So now, here we are. Anyway, I don't care. I don't care. They don't have any power over me. You know. I gotta go to bed. I got work in the morning. You got a job? Work? Yeah, I got a job. Just because I sleep in this fucking bed doesn't mean I'm like some fucking lowlife scumbag begging for change on the street. Damn. Hm. Hm-mm-hmm. Just one moment. Okay. Now, uh, let's see. Can you... can you tell me something? Is there a way to get some money here? Oh, yeah. You get a job. Or get on welfare or Social Security or disability or food stamps or, um... The purpose of this evaluation is to see what kinda services you're eligible for. You know... psychiatric, substance abuse... ...whatever or what not. Do you understand what I'm saying? Are you alright? Uh, you're here because I'm going to evaluate you so I can help you out, so I can see what services I can get you. How I can take care of you. I'm sorry, one second.

You ain't got no right to talk to me this way. I live here! I live here like everybody else does. You ain't got no right to say this thing to me. Treat me the way you do. Act like I'm gonna rat on my boys here. These men are my brothers. You don't know that shit? You don't live here with us, that's why. If you know what to say, you don't know shit. Don't matter what you say to me. You don't know shit. You got to learn to act, man! You hear me? Take care, Mr. Turner. You got your nerve, man. You got your goddamn nerve. You give me some cigarette, you think I'm gonna rat on people. These are my people. These are my brothers. You sit up there, try to be like the grand master of this here place. You ain't shit, Mike. What do you want? Hmm? Do you want something? Ah, you're the new guy. Dixon Turner. Attorney at law. I don't have anything. I want to represent you. I don't know what you want from me? I'm just kidding. I'm a jazz man. You know, I'm a musician. I play, I play good too. Yeah. Yeah. Where you going? I'm go... I'm going. Oh, I'll walk with you. Come on. Come on, I'll walk with you. Done much walking since you been reduced? Hmm? I'm not reduced. Yeah, you reduced. Refined. Relocated. Remitted. I don't know what that means. Replaced. I'm not reduced. Whatever they call homelessness, that's what you are. I'm not homeless either. Yeah, you're homeless. What... what number are we? Hmm? What number we got? Listen, listen, George, you got any children? I got 2 sons... ...so they tell me. Army, marines. Good boys. Good boys. And I got a daughter uh, though she didn't make it. Human Im... Immuno... Immuno... You know, HIV... ...took her. Baby didn't stand a chance. And I got another daughter. Uh, they say between 1975 and 1976. But you know how it is being a musician on the road makin' music. White powder. Cocaine, heroin. And a few other things too. Ended up right where you thought you'd never be but here I am. Here I am. So, hey, hey, listen to this. Well, do you know that every, um, human male... That's a man, like you and me. ...makes enough sperm in 2 weeks to impregnate every ovulating woman on this planet? That's a fact, man. I heard it once from this, uh, doctor I was hanging out with on the... on the streets. He... he was a meth head. You know, tweaker. Hmm. He worked at Harlem and, uh, did these, uh, tests uh, tuberculosis tests at the Harlem Hospital. You know, he let them inject him... ...for McDonald coupons. Can you believe that? But he... he... he... he dead now. So I don't see him anymore. He was killed by this, uh, transvestite he was seein' on and off. More often on, if you know what I'm talkin' about. A real doctor with a real MD until he lost his license. He was a... a brain... brain man. Every 2 weeks. Every fertile female on the planet. You know, the only thing I... I do for pleasure these days is have myself a Coca Cola. Coca Cola is my only... Yeah. Sometimes, Pepsi. Hey, you know what, I... I... I played for Bill Evans once. You know... you know who it is, don't you? Bill Evans, jazz man. I played for him once uh, about 10 blocks from here. He said, I played okay. Can you believe that? That's like Michelangelo sayin', he sayin' he admires your... your paint job on the ceilin'. I played okay. Bill Evans. Shit. Damn, we're gonna be here all day. you are a citizen of the United States? What? No, uh, not on my person. I don't have it, no. No, I'm sorry. It's okay. Look, can you get it and come back? I don't know where it is. Alright, what's your social security number? Okay, okay, uh... 930... No. 05... Sir, that's not right. I think. 930? 9, no. 93005... It's not correct... The first digit can't be 9, sir. 093? Oh, boy. I think. I... 093? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't. I can't remember. I have a hard time with... with numbers. I... I have rem... remembering problems sometimes... That's okay. It's okay, it's okay. We need some documentation, anyway. You must get a new social security card. Where do I get that? $3000 per person per month per person staying in the shelter. I say, Mr. Commissioner of Housing Mr. Housing Commissioner give me $800 rent, and you can spend the rest on pussy for all I care. Get you a lot of pussy with that kind of money. Give me a little bit of self-respect. That's what I want. That's all I want. A place I can call my own. Give me a nice place. Give me some bleach. I'll clean it up. I'll clean up real neat, and respectable-like. Have some of my musician friends over there. Get us some jazz. You wanna get cleaned up? A shower? I... I know this lady up in the Bronx. Opens her apartment up, and you can take a shower but then, it's gonna cost you. The shelter's free. The choice is yours. Would you rather go up there, or the shelter? You hear? I'm done. Done? That dude missed curfew. You miss curfew, you're fucked. They make you sit out in hallways. They give your bed away to somebody else. Empty your locker. It's your locker, so you can lock it up. But here's the thing, you come back the next night they make you sit in the hallway till after midnight then maybe, just maybe, you get a bed. They call that packing up, if you know what I mean. Packin' up. It takes you seven days to get your... get your locker back. And now some of the case workers, they really care. They're good people, they're trying to get us housing but there's no housing out there to be had so they become desensitized. Too many of us, you know. Too many of us. Think about it for a moment from a taxpayer's point of view. We get a mattress, a bed, a locker. Uh, shampoo, toothpaste. It ain't right. It ain't a square deal. We didn't earn it. It's a handout, not a hand-up. Turner, leave that man alone. Oh, shit. He bothering you? No, not at all. He said no, not at all. Go back to bed and stop hanging out down here. Go back to bed? You need to kiss my ass. Go back to bed. Treat me like some goddamned child. You... you... you... you watch yourself. You're the child around here. Go back to your bed. Hey. Hey. He bothering you? No. Not at all. Well, if you need me, just call. You know, you just gotta get there really early. You guys are just, you know, you're not getting there early enough. Yeah, but you know, it's raining, you know. I don't wanna get wet. But it's not raining today, which is good. Alright, I'm gonna go. Thanks, you guys. I'll see you later, okay. Yeah. You know some days, this feels heavy... ...you know. You guys have a good day. Have a good night too. Sheila? Who? Sheila! That's not my name. Sheila! What do you mean? It's me. That's not my name. Uh, but, uh, you're Shelia. I'm George. This is George. I don't know what... George, I don't know who... who the fuck you are. Please don't talk to me, okay? Don't talk to me... I lost my friend. And then I stopped looking for him, I didn't know anyone but you. Wait, wait, wait wait, wait, wait. Look, I was just gonna get some beer. You have money? I got enough for a six pack. You want some? Do I get to keep the cans? I know how to make enough to get through, you know. Cannin' works for basic daily needs, basically. And if I'm up at 5 in the morning, I can be done before the midtown worker bees even finish breakfast. Also, cans that pile up from the night before. Anyone, you know. Cops, other homeless. Teachers from Colombia. Hasidim. No one's above it. I... I started that when I was a kid. I slept with a few guys but that was just so I could get away from my stepdad. Stepdad... You know what they say, incest is best. Ha! Not really, not really, huh? I... I... I thought I could go to Vegas and do something with the cards because I was good at counting. Is that stupid or what? But you know what, I lost my taste for hooking after Joseph beat the shit out of me that last time because I wouldn't let his johns tie me up. That's where I draw the line. I gotta be in charge. You... you gotta get along to get along, you know? You... your real friends will look out for you. On the street, that is. I am done with the shelters. I am done. You... Why... Why are you looking at me like that? Sheila. You awake? That was nice. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Ssh, ssh. You're insane. Will you move? Excuse me, thank you. Why would you just give me those photos like that? I didn't have any other place to put 'em. I'm... I'm... I'm between places right now. Look... Sheila's gone. Don't talk. I don't wanna hear it. Actually, I don't need to know anything about your life. So, what is it you want? You want money? Is that it? Alright, well. Here. All I have. Yeah, I don't... I don't need all of it. What else? You seem good. You seem pretty good. What else do you want... I... I want... Because I'm busy... How much is it... And I don't wanna get involved in any of your fucked up shit ever again. I don't. Alright. Thank you. Just stop feeling so sorry for yourself. I'm probably gonna move away, dad. Like, far away. Then you won't be able to find me. So, you should just say goodbye now. Are you really moving? Alright, whatever. I'm busy, alright? Sorry. Hey, fuckhead. Stop that! Hey, fuck, I said stop that. Hey, get the fuck outta here. You, fucking animal. I said get the fuck outta here. I oughta get you arrested. That's their only objective is to make you and I feel like... What the fuck? Where you been, man? Where you been? You lucky motherfucker. You stay out all night, and they don't give your bed away. Like you're untouchable, mm-hmm. It's like there's no punishing King George around here. Hmm. So, where you been? What did you do? Where did you go? Did you go dancing? That's what you did? Hey! Come on. Hmm? Go back! Come on. Oh, a fight! What happened to the other guy, do you know? They sent him to another shelter. Lucky bastard. Qualifies for all sorts of shit now. I told 'em that you weren't right in the head and you needed somebody to look after you. You're okay with that, right? Yeah, I'm not right in the head. Yeah. You know I've got this cousin in Kenya. Has a big factory there. You know, the turbines, uh, cotton or some shit like that, sugar. Said he'd give me a real cushy job. The city says, if I... if I sign a paper sayin' that I wouldn't come back to the New York shelter they will buy me a ticket. Send me there. Free of charge. That's right. You believe that? No, I don't... Buy me a ticket to go all the way there. Hmm. But I can't go. I can't leave Russell. Gentlemen, lights out. 10 minutes. Who's Russell? My dog. A dog? He's my main man. Mm-hmm. Where is he? Huh? I... I don't know. But if you got a family they'll take you in. They... they'll fly you there. Free of charge. It's a sweet deal thing. They're gonna want to, you see 'cause they want you out of here. Out of this hell hole. I'd be in China right now if it wasn't for Russell. Hey, hey, look at this. Look at me. See that there? See that? Can you read that? That's the Lord's prayer. An Aramaic. Galilean, that's the... That's the Jesus... That's right. Be my back, I got your back. Now, you see that little... that little, round thing there. That's the... that's the all-seeing eye. See everything. I got your back. Hmm. There's nothing to worry about. Dix is on the case. Yeah. You're gonna need to bring in your birth certificate if you wanna get a new social security card. Yeah, I don't have... Okay, you're gonna have to find one. You're gonna have to get something equivalent to it. Now, he does not need a birth certificate. The man is here. You see him standing here. His... When you get your paperwork together then please bring it back, and I'll try to help you. Excuse me, ma'am. I like that hair. You got any change for me? Sorry. A... a... a dime or somethin'?

Muscular dude. Ha, ha. Look at 'em walking there. Like Samson. Boom, boom. I don't have that. I'm sorry. It can be anything. Anything like what? What... A driver's license? No. A state issued non-driver photo ID card? No. A passport? I had one once. No! US military photo ID card? I wasn't in the military. No. It can be 2 recent utility bills with your name and address. I don't have an address. I'm really sorry... Telephone? Con Ed? Cable? I... I... He does not have a home. A... at the moment, I don't have a home, at the moment... Then you can get a letter from a government agency dated within the last 6 months. Taxes, social security. Do you think we'd be here if he had that shit, hmm? Do you? You need a valid photo ID for a copy of your birth certificate. Okay, yeah, I understand. Then come back, alright? Thank you, gentlemen. Yeah, okay. He fell on the tracks. He was all diced and sliced up. You know, it was interesting 'cause he lived in the subway. On the E train, which is small. Because the E train stays underground. They don't come up above ground. $60,000 in his shoes, in his sock. He... you don't get it. The man didn't have to be who he was. He had all the help he needed in his feet. He didn't have to be homeless. The disease told him he was homeless. The disease told him that he wasn't worth anything. Would you say something? Anything! Did you hear what I was just saying? Are you the idiot or am I? Am I what? Because I... it's what I've been thinking about. I've been feeling for the last... Yeah? ...10 years maybe that I am... ...just one stupid, fucking... ...loser of an idiot. And I'd... You know, uh, I'm just not so sure anymore. Am I homeless? No, no, no, you just need... Am I homeless? You're reduced, on your way up, George, that's all... I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I don't have a home... No, you're not. That's not what this is about. I'm homeless. I'm nobody. I... I don't exist. We're reduced... What do you mean we don't exist? Oh, fucking, we don't exist. Maybe you don't exist. I... I exist. I'm gonna prove to you that you... ...that they... they think you're a fucking clown. You're a clown. They think we're clowns. We're cartoons. I'm a clown now? You and me are cartoons. Okay. Okay, I'm... okay, I'm a cartoon. I'm a little cartoon. I will do some animated... Woah, woah, a cartoon. I'm animated. I know who I am. I am a cartoon. Alright, look at me. I am a cartoon. Oh, oh, oh! Hey, hey, you okay in there? Yeah. Oh, okay. Da, da, da, da, da. Hey, hey. Wash your hands. Wash your hands. You should be working. You should get your own place. But you don't wanna. Why? Why is that? 'Cause you're sick in the head. You're not well. You got no support system. I mean, you... you got old and, uh, you know, you love this... this sauce too much. You don't like yourself. You're depressed. You don't believe in yourself. So what's society supposed to do with you? Why should they care? It's all your fault... If you keep talking like this about me I am going to hurt you. Do you understand that? I will hurt you, I swear. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about myself. Uh, do you guys, uh do you guys want something like rice and vegetables Yeah, thank you. Give me 1 minute, alright? Sure thing, sure thing. Hmm, vegans. Kindest people on the planet.

Uh-huh. Oh! I... I, uh, I'd play but it's out of tune. You know, it's just here to decorate the place. You know, class it up, that sort of... I don't believe you. What? You don't believe it's out of tune? I don't think you can play. Is that so? I don't believe it. I don't believe it at all. Oh, oh, oh, so, so I... I gotta play or you're gonna... gonna hurt me like you've been saying? Is that it? Is that... is that right? Mm? I'm sorry. You sorry? You so... Yeah. Would you stop fucking apologizing? I don't need you to believe nothing. You keep talking, you just keep talking. Yeah, I keep talking 'cause I know who I am... No wonder nobody likes you. Nobody likes me? People don't like you. No, they don't like you. No. Oh, it's, uh... It's almost definitely out of tune. Ah! I told you. Yeah, it's my dad's from years ago. See. No one's played in a while. But, um, if you guys, uh... If you guys can play, by all means. Tickle the ivories. Oh, I can play. I can play like the devil. I don't need to prove nothing to nobody. You can't play. You Marcus Junius Brutus. You are Judas. I am a musician. I'm a damn good musician. I don't hear you playing. I don't hear it. It's, uh, did you... did you hear what the man just said? The man just said it's out of tune. I said it's out of tune. Would you get the damn wax out of your ear? It's out of tune. Think about my reputation. How can a great jazz musician like me Alright, okay. Well, it's... it's all good. Here, I... I made some rice. I made some for the both of you. I ain't giving him nothin'. You two are like, uh, an old married couple or something? Oh, oh, oh, yeah, I give you that. I don't believe in gay marriage. Or even straight marriage either. A man should be free to have fun. Marriage is... isn't a God-given gift. It's a life sentence. That's what marriage is. Finally, finally, finally, we got some peace and quiet here. Alright? Okay? Give me. Can I... Oh, oh. Thank you. Oh! Hmm. ...and we lost our insurance. I lost my job. I fell hard, long. I started drinking. Home, lost that. And then... then she died. My... my daughter... ...was 12. At that time, Maggie was 12. She, um... I couldn't... I kind of went down the rabbit hole. Then I couldn't... So she was raised by her grandmother. My wife's mother. Uh... I couldn't even look at her. I... I just felt... I don't know, that was a... about 10 years that just kinda went away. About 10 years, I was... My mind just wouldn't become quiet, and then... The noise, and then... ...some lady friends... ...who were incredibly... ...generous, and kind, nice. Gave me their bed, gave me their couches and then, they gave me the boot. So, I don't know anybody anymore. Oh, hey. Hey, man. How's it goin'? I thought they moved you to another shelter. What? Oh, no, no. That jabber mouth, Dixie gave me some dough to switch places with him. He said the spot had good joo joo or somethin'. I don't know. I just wanted to get him off my back. I'm gonna stick around here. I can't get into any trouble, you know. I'm gonna stay here as long as I can. Yeah. Then I'm gonna go back to school next year. You know, if benefits kick in. Get some kinda tight job, you know. I'm thinking tech. Good. Alright, cool. Yeah. Three quarter housing, it's illegal. You'll get a tiny room, and it stinks. The bunk beds stacked up to the ceiling.
