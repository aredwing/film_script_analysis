I can tell you my pedigree all the way back to the tribe that my greatest grandfather came from. I was born into privilege, groomed by my father to be a businessman, to take over his company. Groomed by my mother to be a gentleman. I was told where to stand and how to dress, how to cut my hair, and what I would be doing for the rest of my life from the time that I was five years old. And right now, I seem to be on track. Whose track, I don't really know. By this time, my mother thought I should be married, and according to my life schedule, it's four months away. I'll be marrying her, Natalie. She's amazing. We 're perfect together. With a life like mine, you'd think that I wake up happy every day, but I don't. My life is perfect. But I often wonder, am I living my own life, or the life that I've been told to live? This tie is too dark. I think this tie is too dark. Green. Green. Green's better. Maria forgot to put the shoe stretchers in my shoes. Babe, you know Maria forgot to put my shoe stretchers in again? - Really? - Yeah. I'll talk to her. I'll tell you who it won't be, Deeds Incorporated. According to the rumor mill, the software giant... No, I've been listening to the radio. Yeah. No, no, no. Listen, this is what I want you to do. Just get everybody, set up a conference call, I will figure it out when I get there. John, don't panic. It's all fine. I'm looking at the paper now. Okay. Thanks. Hello. Yeah, I have a morning meeting. Showing the Jones apartment. Right. Hey, can you tell Jeffrey to have something cool for kids? - What do kids like? - Toys, honey. Toys. Toys. Bye. See you soon. What would you like for breakfast? Egg whites and oatmeal. Egg whites and oatmeal will be fine. And don't forget the grapefruit juice. - And grapefruit juice? - Right here. - I don't care, Walter! - Fine. It doesn't matter to me! Neither do you! Get out of here, then! You know what? Karma's a bitch! And you're gonna get yours. Walter! You're crazy! You're a drunkard! And you're a nobody! - Trick. - Oh, yeah, I'm a trick? Don't look at me like that, just drive! - Walter... - Just drive! Walter, how long before you get your driver's license back? You tired of driving me already? You know what, I'll get a driver. Don't you worry about me. I don't need you. I didn't say I was tired of driving you. I just asked you a question, that's all. I don't know. Mom won't speak to the judge. - Would you do it? - No! Come on. Please! Why can't you just get your license back just like everybody else who's had several DUIs? You know, Dad would've done it for me. 'Cause he loved me. We all love you, okay? Well, Mom has a weird way of showing it. She's been through a lot with you, man, she's tired. Get a tie out of the glove box. We're seeing her for lunch. Hell, no. Hell, no! I ain't going Take me home, Wesley! We're going to work, then we're going to lunch. Okay, just shut up! I'll have it later, when I get off. Lindsey, you know, the owner could have the sheriff here today. Come on, Milton. Just take one for the team. She's already filed the writ of eviction. - Will you just give me a couple hours? - Give me a break. Look, I'm saying I'll have it. I just need... I'll have it today. All right? Just tell her that. That's all I'm asking, just tell her that. Are we gonna get put out? I don't want you worrying about that. How much more do we need? Ariel, stop it. Come on, let's get your shoes on. We're gonna make a stop before you get to school. We can expect light onshore wind coupled with an upper level low pressure drop off the coast that will deepen the marine layer across the coastline today... We got a spot! You know what? Watch what you're doing! You trying to kill me? Damn! Lady! Listen. Hey, hey. Look, you're in my parking spot. Oh, really. Well, you know what? I'll just be one second. - Lady, I got a conference call I gotta get to... - I haven't got time for this right now! Excuse me? "I have a conference call"? That ain't how you stop no black woman in her tracks. - Walter, don't you... - This how you stop a woman. Hey, bitch! Walter! Who the hell are you calling "bitch"? The man said move your car! - Hey! Hey! - Walter! That mouth of yours is gonna get you killed, man. Hey, Kat. Yeah, man, this is Walt Deeds. Listen, I need a tow truck in the parking lot. Some lady parked in my brother's spot. Thanks. This woman left her child in the car, man. So? That car and that kid are about to get towed, man. Just leave your car here, Kat'll come down and he'll park it. Call April, have her transfer the conference call down to the car, okay? You want to sit here and wait? Yeah, April? I don't talk to strangers. Wes wants the conference call transferred to the car. Thank you. See? Little black girl already got attitude. And that little black girl gonna turn into an even bigger damn black girl with even bigger attitude, man! Just get in the car, Walter. Just get in the car, please. You know I don't have a cell phone. It's hard as hell trying to find a payphone and you're not answering the phone. Inventory. Can I get my check? And then I have to go someplace, just for a couple of hours. Your shift starts in 30 minutes. I know, and I will make it up. I just... There's something I gotta do. Be back by 10:00. - What is this? - Your check. No, I know that. But I worked 80 hours this past two weeks. So where's the rest of it? Human Resources got a letter from the IRS. They said you were behind in back taxes, so they held most of your pay. No. I need all of it. Today. I have to have it today. There's nothing I can do, doll. Why don't you call the IRS and see if you can't make some type of arrangement with them? Can you give me an advance on next week? They're going to take most of your check for the next six months. I've been trying to talk to you about that position from 4:00 to 11:00. And who looks after my kid at night? I'm sorry, doll. - No, you're not. - We gotta fill it quickly. If you want it, you'd better tell me about it now. Do I have a choice? I gotta take my kid to school. With Dexter leaving, where does that put us, John? Not in the best place. They were 75% of our profit. Hold on a second, when did they get to 75%? Last quarter it was 60. When Walt offered them a 12% discount on all new products, they upped their deal. It was a good idea at the time. Okay, it was! Fine, we 're in it now. Get every financial bit of information you can on Brunson. I'll be burning the midnight oil on this one, John, so I'll be up in a second. Wait a second. Excuse me. How much does this cost? Mr. Deeds says it's free for employees. - Everybody? - Yes. Wow. Fat Boy Harley. Nice. You just ought to do that, Wes. Do what? Get a bike. Meet up with Rich, Josh, in Mexico. Were you not just on this conference call? I got a business to run. I can run this company. Oh, you don't think I can run the business? - Walter. - What? Wesley, this wasn't even your dream. It was mine. - I can run this company, man. - How about you show me? Stop saying it, just show me. Oh, no. Hey. Hey! - No, come on, please. - Here she comes. I'm sorry, lady. You were parked illegally. You made him tow my car? You parked in his spot, lady. I'm not talking to you, midget! I'm talking to this ass. - Ass? - Yeah, you heard me. - He's the ass? - I was in there for a second. Look, I don't know how much they pay you for doing your job, but I can... Look, I got $10... - Go on, just take it. - I'm sorry, lady. I told you I'm sorry. Get your kid out, please. - No, sweetie. - Please don't let them take my mommy's car. - Sweetie, come on. - It's your mother's fault. Learn early. You piss a man off, he will get even! Don't you talk to my kid! Don't you say a word to my kid! - Sir. Sir. - Walter. He's a "sir" now, huh? Gone from an ass to sir? - Sir Ass ain't got nothin' to say to your ass. - Walter, Walter. Please don't take my car. "Please don't take." You ain't got no choice! Hey, Frank, get it out of here! All right, you don't park in a man's spot! See, that's what's wrong with women, man. You want to start a fight with a man and boo-hoo when he fight back! Walter. Go. Just get the elevator. Please. Next time you might want to find somewhere else to park. Put it down, Frank. Jillian, just park my car, okay? I think my iPad's in the back. You just sit down. Ass! - You see? Move, man! - Walter, it's handled! No! You ain't gonna handle it. I'm gonna handle it! - I ain't gonna let her call you an ass! - Get on the elevator, man. - Come on, man! - Please. You like getting walked on? God. Ms. Wakefield! Ms. Wakefield. I need to talk to you for a second. - I'm running really late for work. - This will only take a second. If you get cold, put that on. I love you. - Bye, Mommy. - Bye, baby. - Hi. - I'm having a day! I just need to tell you, you bring your daughter to school late and you pick her up late and her teacher has been complaining. Well, I will bring her on time. Okay, but I have to tell you. This is a warning. I'm not one of your students, Ms. Mackey. I hear you. Isn't this exciting, Mrs. Deeds? Very. I wish I had a daughter. - Girls are a handful. - Yeah. Boys, too. Especially that son of mine. - How is Walt? - He's better. I cannot believe the two of you are finally getting married. Do you have any idea how much your mother and I have wanted this for the two of you? Yeah. I think I do. Well, it's a good thing they wanted it, too. And pretty soon your little ones will be playing with my little ones. I'm beside myself at the thought of having grandchildren! Let's get through the engagement party first, huh, kids? - You do want children, don't you? - Of course she does. Well, you better get busy. You're not getting any younger. Looks like mostly little girl's stuff in this one. Isn't this nice? At least get $50. - No! No! - This, you might get $30. This is my place! No, I beg you, please. No! Give me... Put that down! - How could you do this? - I'm sorry! You let them do this! I told you she would do this! No! - I tried to talk her out of it! - Yeah, sure you did. - I did. - Yeah, sure you did. - Let me help you. - Don't touch me! Yeah, what are you looking at? Don't you help me! - Move your car! - Go to hell! Lady, what do you think this is? - Shame on you. - Let's go! All right, shame on you! - Good afternoon, Mrs. Deeds. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Mom, it's good to see you. - Good to see you. Sit up straight. Rise and greet me. Well, sit up or stand up, what do you want, Mom? - "Hello" will do fine. - Hello, Mother. Thank you. - You look quite lovely. - Thank you! You should see the wedding dress. It's not quite my taste, but it'll work just fine. I'm so proud of you. You remind me of your father. I told you, you shouldn't get married. Natalie is a respectable girl from a very fine family, unlike that trailer-park cheerleader you married. Mother, if I remember correctly, Dad met you at a trailer park. Mother? The engagement party, how's the planning going? Mom? It's going to be beautiful. What is this, Walt? A drink in the middle of the day? Well, if I have to sit here with you, you better be glad it's not a mountain of cocaine. You enjoy this, don't you? Yes, I am. You think it's funny. Why can't you be more like your brother? Mom, now look, what's going on? I wanted to see you. You insisted on inviting your brother. Well, you said it was about business and he is a part of the business, so I thought he should be here. Still going to your meetings? Why? Yes. Yes, he is. I make sure of it. Mom. What's going on? I read the newspaper. Are we all right? This is just like I thought. You're worried about yourself. Your father worked very hard to build this business, and to lose it like this would be unthinkable. Don't worry, Mom, perfect little Wesley's gonna work it all out for you. Oh, yes, he will. And you will find some way to try to sabotage it. Where are you going? I'm going to have a cigarette. Is that okay? I can't drive. Wesley has to drive me, Mom, 'cause you have my car locked up in the office garage. Okay? I'm going to have a smoke. It takes the patience of Job to deal with him. Don't get worked up about it, Mother. He's fine. It's all fine. Okay, go on. Now listen. I need you to help Mommy and be a big girl. - You can lay down... - I'm scared. No, listen, you can try and go to sleep, and I'll be back to check on you in an hour. I want Daddy. Ariel, don't do that. Don't do that "Daddy" thing. Come on. But you must not come out of the closet, all right? And I'll be back to check on you in an hour. Put the participation and the operating profit, and you take that from the gross... I don't understand what he's doing, or how he's doing this. - Can we go home now? - What? Can we go home now? I'm still working, Walter. And you should be, too. Did you finish the Brunson report? Anything else, Mr. CEO? I'm taking a cab home. Don't say a word. You know, everybody around here is talking about him, it's not just me. He's not doing a very good job. He's sleeping with several staffers. John. My brother. My father told me to take care of him and that's what I intend to do. Can you take care of this, please? Make sure it's right. Okay. Look, I gotta go. Heidi's going out with Natalie tonight and I get to play Daddy. Okay. Come on. Let's do this tomorrow morning. No, no, I'm not leaving here until I figure this out. This one, I'm gonna burn the midnight oil. Something's up. All right. I'll talk to you later. All right, yeah. - Tell Heidi I said hi. - Yeah. Okay, John, okay. I love you. Kiss the kids for me, okay? All right. Bye, I love you. How amazing is it that he's given me tonight off? I mean, I can't believe it, we're out! Yeah, I'm so glad you could come out, girl. Me, too! I know, the kids keep me so busy. Okay, Heidi, can we please not talk about your kids today? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm a jerk. It's just that all we ever talk about these days are your kids. I know, I'm sorry. It's girls' night out. So we're here for Mark. No kids, no husbands. No future husbands. In fact, I am turning this phone off. Thank you. - So how late we gonna be out tonight? - As late as we wanna be. Okay. Better call the nanny and tell her... No. You better call Wesley and tell him it's gonna be a long night. No, no, no. We do not have that kind of relationship. - What do you mean? - We just don't check in with each other. - You don't? - No. - What? - I just don't understand that. No, I don't have to check in with him, because I know where he is. I can literally set my watch by Wesley. Like, he always does the same thing, and he's always gonna do the same thing, so... Like right now, I know that he's working late in his office. Wow. - What? What? - It's just crazy. - Hello? - John. Hey, listen, I am sitting at the office, and I've gone through all of these financial reports, and I see what Brunson is doing. - What? He's in dire straits. He has got this other company that is interested in bidding, so he's trying to drive up all of his prices. That's why he took the biggest client from us. It is pretty evident he can't afford to support him. You sound pretty sure about this. I know it, man. I'm sitting here, I'm looking at it. It's pretty clever, but I knew I'd find it. You know what, can you try and get a meeting with him for me tomorrow? Yeah, okay. I'll call him first thing in the morning. This is a message for Ms. James. It's Lindsey Wakefield. I need to talk to you about making some kind of payment arrangements, and I will call you at 10:00 a.m. sharp tomorrow. I'll be working, so that's the only time I can call... Bye. I'm sorry. I didn't know that anybody was here. You do know that's grounds for termination, right? You gonna run off, tell massa everything what's goin' on? Just give me a break, black man. "Run tell massa"? I know about the old white dude that owns this place. He's evil to all you employees. Look, I get it. I won't do it again. Old white dude. What's his name? I don't know. You don't know his... Deeds? Deeds Incorporated? It doesn't matter. I'm not gonna use the phone again. "Ass." You think you gonna get some ass to keep your mouth shut? What is wrong with you? Lady, I wasn't asking for ass. You called me an ass, when you parked in my spot. Yes, that was me. I'm so sorry. I really need this job. I'm in all kinds of... Please. When I saw your child sitting in that car, she was afraid. Reminded me of the time that my parents took me to the Maldives one summer. My father said, "Don't go into the sea, son. I can't swim, so don't go in." I didn't care. I grabbed the life ring, soon as he turned his back I jumped in. I almost drowned. My father's standing there, screaming, "Swim, son, swim!" Children don't really know what adults know. You shouldn't leave her alone in a car. And don't use the phone again. How many kids you got? How many kids have you got? I don't have any children. Yeah. That's what I thought. So don't you lecture me on how to raise my child, Mr. Maldives. How'd you get out? Excuse me? The water. Your daddy couldn't swim, so how'd you get out? My brother. He jumped in and saved me. See, you should've kept your ass on the shore. What? Are you following me? Where'd you come from, beautiful? The babysitter just dropped her off. Ariel, can you get down from there? You know, you really shouldn't be sitting here on these side streets. My secretary got mugged going to her car one night. Pretty... Thank you! What? What do you want? Are you okay? I was gonna ask you the same thing. Are you okay? You're just sitting here. My car won't start, but it's fine. I don't know much about cars, but I could call a tow truck for you, maybe. Yeah, you did that already. I don't mind dropping you and your daughter off somewhere if you like. No, I have a friend who's gonna be here soon. - Somebody's on their way? - Yeah. - Okay, I'll just wait, then. - No! What? I'll just find a spot here. He is not gonna park his car. He is gonna... Ariel, just keep quiet, all right? I don't know what this man wants. But... I did not invite you in my car. Hi. What's your name? - Ariel. - I'm Wesley. You know Ariel's the name of a mermaid? Did anybody tell you that? How do you know that? I know something about it. I got a friend who has two kids and they love The Little Mermaid. - Did you hear my name? - Well, obviously. Well, you just told her. It's Wesley. I got it. Wesley Deeds. What? I'm the old white man. And you are? - Unemployed, Tight? - No. I'm so humiliated. I'm so sorry. And I called you an ass. I'm Lindsey. Good to meet you, Lindsey. And you don't have to stay here. It's all good. No, it's fine, really. My secretary was mugged. I felt really bad when she was, 'cause I had her working really late... - So you want to stay in the car. - I'll stay here, it's all fine. You work with my mom? Yes, I do. - What floor? - On the top floor. - I was on the top. - No, Ariel, don't... Don't be bothering Mr. Deeds with all that chat. Sorry. Got a lot of stuff in here. We... We're in the process of moving. Right, baby? We're done. Almost done. What part of town? I don't think you'd know it. Is that your stomach? Are you hungry? What? Again? Sweetie, you didn't eat with the babysitter? You know, there's a pizza joint right up the block here. You want to take a walk? Would you like some pizza? No. I don't think I have my wallet. No, I got it, it's fine. Now come on. Come on, honey. Come on, let's go. It's right around the corner. - Come on, Ariel! - Okay, that's what we're doing. Yep. That's just perfect. Mark, I think she needs our help. I need a drink. Is this me? So, what's going on with you? What? Why aren't you guys dancing? - Why have you not stopped dancing? - Because I'm having a good time. The last time you did this was back in college, when you broke up with... - Rene, right! - What are you guys talking about? - Why haven't I met your future husband yet? 'Cause you're busy. He's busy, everybody's busy. No one is that busy, okay? I met Rene the first week you met him. You were in love, you were falling all over him. You talked about him all the time. This man, you do not talk about. He's amazing, okay? He's fantastic and I am in love. - Am I missing something? - Yes, a good time. You Debbie Downers are blowing my buzz. You're really enjoying that, aren't you? Yeah. You know, you have eyed that video game five times in the last four minutes. Do you want to play? - Yeah. - Yeah? My mom doesn't have enough money to play fun things. No, fun things should be free. Come on! I got a little money, come on. Do you know how to play this? Let's see what we got here. This one? Here we are. Hey, hey. She's a pretty special kid. - Hey, I don't know why she's so hungry. - Kids are always hungry. Harley. - Softail Deluxe. - Deluxe! What do you know about it? Her daddy used to work at a place called Baker Boy's Bikes. - On Elm? - Yes! - You know it? - I do, I do. Well, small world. I remember when I was a kid, boy, I would spend hours there all the time. You ride? I did once. When I was about 17. We'd hang out there all day. We all wanted... It's so crazy. We all wanted to get Harleys, right? We just had this dream of riding our bikes all over the world, digging wells in remote villages. So I started trying to learn how to ride and my mom found out I was hanging out down there and she hit the roof. Crazy, right? I don't think that is crazy at all. It means you have a good heart. That's what that means. So you ride? You're looking at a pro. Oh, come on. That I would like to see. Well, not on this salary, you won't. So am I fired? No. But I gotta tell you, nobody's ever talked to me like that before. You park in my spot, you call me an ass. Shoot, I mean, it's just been a pretty interesting day, my friend. - That is sad, if that is true. - What's sad? Wait a second. Excuse me. How much does this cost? Mr. Deeds says it's free for employees. - Everybody? - Yes. It means nobody's ever told you the truth... - No, I beg to differ. - ...that's what that means. People tell me the truth, they're just not... They're just not rude when they say it. I wouldn't call it rude. I was just being direct. Direct? - Okay, fine. If you say so. - I do. Direct. Does that turn you on? - Now you got jokes. - Look at your face. Funny, too. How long have you worked at the company? A year. So what is it, this Deeds Incorporated? What do you do? My father was a computer whiz. And he came up with this great software, sold it to the government. It was top secret. About 20 years ago he got it declassified and went public. Company went through the roof. A little help from affirmative action, because it was very necessary. From there, he started buying smaller companies, taking their ideas, branding them with his. I don't know what you're talking about. Did I lose you? Did I lose you? Just talk to me like a real person. What is it that you sell? Come on. Okay, how about this? We sell computer software. All right. My dad's dream. And he did it. Speaking of dreams, was it your dream to be a janitor? You ask a lot of questions. I'm sorry. That's what an ass will do. You said it. No. I was in nursing school. I had two years left. I was close. Two years left? What happened? Two years ago, her dad died in Iraq. He was in the military. So it all fell on me. I quit school. But I needed a job, so I'm a janitor. - I'm sorry. - You know what? My boyfriend was on his way over to help with the car and if I'm not there, or if you... Oh, yeah, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I understand. - You understand? - I completely understand. Forgive me. I should be getting home anyway. - It's getting late. - You want me to get some of that? No. Please, it's all fine. Let's get out of here. - So, you enjoy yourself? - Yeah. Looks like it's gonna rain tonight. Yeah. Sure hope your boyfriend gets here soon. What boyfriend? Good night, Ariel. I guess I'll see you around, then. - Yeah. Thank you! - All right. Hope you enjoyed yourself. That man is persistent. I nearly lost my job. All right, come on, let's get some gas. Someone is Sister Sloshed. - Wow! - Somebody woke up mistah. She's all yours. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. Bye, precious. - Tell John I'll see him in the morning. - I will. - Bye. I had a good time. - Bye. - Mark, you better not be driving. - I have a driver! What is this? Oh, yeah, you're wasted. Come on, I'll take you to bed. I might take you to bed. - You gonna take me? Okay. Take me. - Yeah. I'm gonna take you to bed on the couch. What are you doing? All right, babe. Let me close the blinds. You know how sick the guy across the way is... I know. - Hey. - Please stop it. - Look at my ass! - Babe, babe. - That's not funny. - Let him watch. - He can learn something. - Really, stop. Just get the remote off the table. Oh, my God. Really? You can't do one spontaneous thing in your whole life? Just one thing? Who cares? Let him watch! Come on. Go ahead. Mommy, I'm hungry. You're gonna have some breakfast at school. All right? We appreciate your seeing us this morning, Mr. and Mrs. Brunson. What's this about? We'd like to buy your company. My father worked his entire life building that company. So did ours. That, I'm aware of. But I've been looking at your quarterly reports for the last three years and things aren't looking too good. You can't survive with those numbers. Yes, I can, and I have been for years. And with the pick up of Dexter Sky, well, things are looking up. Dexter Sky, yes, our biggest client. You just pulled them right out from under us. But in order to do that, you had to make some pretty steep promises, yes? Puts you in a great position to sell. It does, John, but you know what? If I were in the same position, I probably would've done the same thing. That's really great. You think that all these things were done to get you to buy my company? Come on. Of course. Your father groomed the two of you from birth to run his company and he managed to raise a stellar successor. I admired your father. He took one small computer company and he turned it into all of this. He was a brilliant man. Yeah, well, too bad you weren't man enough to say it to his face when he was alive. - Walt. - No. All this man ever did was torment Dad. - Walter... - You'd rather climb into your damn grave than watch two brothers beat you at your own game. Good day, gentlemen. - Mr. Brunson. Sir. Wait. - I've never been so insulted in my life. Sir, if you could just give us a minute. - What is wrong with you? - What? All I said was the truth! You want to see all of Dad's things sold, everything he worked for, at auction? Is that what you want? Dad would not want to see his son in here begging! What are you... Who was begging? He wasn't begging! Shut up, John. Well. - Hey, how you doing? - First name? Lindsey. L-I-N-D-S... You got it. - Go on in. - No, I can't stay right now. Then why are you in this line? Well, see, I was just wondering. I know you have to be here by 5:00, but I don't get off work till 11:00. So I was just praying that you could hold a spot for me and my daughter. - It's against the rules. - Please. How old is your daughter? Six. Honey, have you ever been in a shelter before? - No, I haven't. - You should try the Petrie House. - They take women and kids. - Yeah, I know. I did, and they're full. So this is it, you know? Okay, knock around back at 11:00, ask for Jerry. Tell him Denise said it was okay for you to stay. And, honey, this is no hotel. Keep your belongings close and your daughter closer, you hear? Thank you. - First name? - Lauren. Go in. - Lonnie. - Go on in. - First name? - Renee. You're upset, aren't you? Where is your mother? She'll be here. When you come to school, you're very hungry. Are you eating at home? Sometimes. Why not all the time? Something wrong with the stove? No. It's... You can tell me. I don't want my mommy to get into trouble. She won't get in any trouble. We sleep in the car. It's okay, I'm here. I'm here. Thank you for waiting, really. Can I talk to you for a second? It's not a great day. Ariel was telling me the two of you are homeless. What? I don't know, she got an imagination. And all that stuff in the car is her imagination? You know what? We're good. Thank you. Ms. Wakefield, I will have to call... I will have to call Child Welfare if you don't talk to me! - I gotta go! What's the matter with you? Why would you tell her that? I'm sorry, Mom. I mean, do you want them to take you from me? - No. - 'Cause I'm telling you that is exactly what'll happen if you go around saying those kind of things to people, come on! 'Cause I'm only telling you for your own good! Now have you got it? Yes. Damn it! Where did you go, baby? - Hey. Where you running to? - No. I... Please, please, listen. No, no, no. I want to talk to you for just a second. - Please, just let me go! - No, no. She's in my office. No, no, Lindsey. Lindsey. - Did I tell you not to move? - Lindsey, Lindsey. - She knows not to... - Listen. She didn't move, I found her. I made her come with me, okay? She didn't leave. Oh, God, did you call Child Welfare? - No. - Thank you. Thank you. But I should have. Lindsey, what is wrong with you? What kind of mother does this? I don't understand what kind of mother would leave her kid in a car... I had to take this new shift and I don't have a babysitter. Sure, I get it. You don't have a babysitter. But there's surely someone in your family who can be a caregiver to this child. No. No, we don't have family. Don't you think I would have done that already? What about this boyfriend, the one that was gonna help you with the car? We broke up. - Is that the truth? - Can you let me go to my kid? No, no, no. Look. I had to drag her out of that closet. She was scared to death. Shaking. Because she was so worried about what you would say or what you would do to her. How often are you hitting her? I would never do that. All right, we're just going through a rough time right now. And I don't like it, but she has to learn to be responsible. You see how ridiculous you sound? She's six years old. She's six! How can she be responsible at six? That's like my parents. You're comparing her to you? She doesn't have a silver spoon in her mouth. You just don't get it! You're the kind of guy who leaves a $10 tip for a $20 bill! I want you to calm down, 'cause I've had just about enough of you... - You just don't understand. - ...this talk about me and my privilege... - We live in the real world. - ...and where I come from. And I don't? No, you do not. Tell me, how much does a gallon of milk cost? You don't even know. Or a gallon of gas. When's the last time you worried about paying a bill? Ariel. You're not... - Come on. - I'm tired. - Lindsey? - Yeah, Jerry? Yeah, come on in. Just follow me, all right? Look, it's lights out, so you want to be quiet, okay? Yeah. All right, the rest room's right down there, okay? You guys are over here on this side. There's your bed, right there. All right? - Thank you. - Have a good night. Mommy, who are all these people? Just lay down. - All right? - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. - You're up late. - And so are you. Yeah, there's a lot going on at the office. You want to talk about it? No. I'll get it all worked out. You were pretty drunk last night. Sorry. Don't apologize. I was just... I don't think I've ever seen you that drunk. I don't think I've ever been that drunk before. Is there a reason why? Work. The real estate market is crap right now. The wedding, the engagement party, and it's all been a little overwhelming, and I guess I just wanted to let my hair down. - Anything I can do? - No, baby, I'll... I'm gonna be fine, don't worry about me. Dang it! What's that? - Really? - What? What? A blonde hair? In our bed? - There's no way. - No. It's a long, blonde hair. Looks like it's brown to me. No, no, it's blonde, like a blonde woman. It's a curly, brown hair. Like I don't know a blonde hair? I know blonde women. - I know they have... - Okay. I know what blonde hair looks like. Blonde, brown, whatever. And it's in our bed. You don't think I had some woman in the bed, now, do you? No. No, I was gonna say Maria needs to tell the dry cleaners, "Be more careful." Babe, how much is a gallon of milk? I don't know. You're lactose intolerant. You're gonna wake that baby! No! Stop! Get up! Get up, baby, get up! Come! Come on, come on! How can you be so sure? What, baby? That I'm not cheating. You know, a little jealousy might be nice, Natalie. Baby, you always do the same thing. Are you saying I'm boring? No. No, I'm saying that you eat the same thing every day, you go to work the same time every day, when we make love, you do it the same way every time. I'm saying you're predictable. - Wesley. - Morning, John. Hit me with it. What'd he say? Well, he and his wife were extremely offended by Walt, but they have the offer. Did he seem interested at all? No. As a person who's advised you for the last few years and your father for two, I have to ask you something. I hate it when you come in with this advisory tone early in the morning. You think your brother's trying to sabotage you? No. I don't. Wesley, all I'm gonna say is that he wants to run this place. So if you fail, he can tell everybody that he was right and your father was wrong for giving you the position. - Hey! - What? - You didn't pick me up. I waited 20 minutes out there for you. Well, just give me my damn keys and I'll drive myself, Wes. I'm not giving you your keys and you know why. I'll talk to you later. You do that, John. What are you trying... Mr. Deeds, this was left on my desk for you. Who's Lindsey? Thank you, April. Who's this? Who's Lindsey? She's the night janitor. Night janitor. So why's she leaving you messages? You screwing her? Why don't you just go to work, Walter? Wait, are you still mad at me about yesterday? You... Look, I'm sorry about the other day, all right? I can't stomach people disrespecting us to our face, Wes. Nobody was disrespecting you, you were disrespectful to them. I can do better. You want me to call them? I'll call Brunson and I'll smooth it over. That's the last thing you're gonna do. All right, so then what would you like me to do, CEO? Why don't you just go to work, Walter? Look, I'm sorry about the other day, all right? I can't stomach people disrespecting us to our face, Wes. Nobody was disrespecting you, you were disrespectful to them. I can do better. You want me to call them? I'll call Brunson and I'll smooth it over. That's the last thing you're gonna do. All right, so then what would you like me to do, CEO? Why don't you just go to work, Walter? It means nobody's ever told you the truth... - No, I beg to differ. - ...that's what that means. People tell me the truth, they're just not... They're just not rude when they say it. I wouldn't call it rude. I was just being direct. Direct? - Okay, fine. If you say so. - I do. Direct. Does that turn you on? - Now you got jokes. - Look at your face. Wait a second. Excuse me. How much does this cost? Mr. Deeds says it's free for employees. - Everybody? - Yes. No, you didn't lose her. You're okay. - I thought I'd lost... - You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Thank you. - Okay. I'll be at the office. Or on my cell if you need anything. Make your call. I'm so sorry. I'll come back later. No, no, no, it's okay. I've got a bunch of things over there need to be taken care of, trash on that side. Thank you. Sure. No, for the child day care... Well, I should say night care. Thank you. You're very welcome. You know, it's really late. Yeah. Got a lot going on. Yeah, you look stressed. What did I say? I... Listen, don't... I don't think anybody in my life will say to me, "You look stressed." Nobody says that. Nobody's comfortable enough to say that to me. They usually think I have it all under control. Who are you around all day? Soon as I walked in I could see that your shoulders are high up around your ears, and your forehead is so tense. Come on, just... Well, what are we doing? You really need just two minutes. Just you put your knees under the desk and put your hands on your thighs. Lindsey, I don't think this is appropriate. It's really okay. I swear I'm not flirting with you. I figure I owe you. Don't forget I was nearly a qualified nurse. Okay. By the way, nobody talks to me the way you talk to me, either. That's 'cause you're so mean. I'm not mean. Just like you're not disconnected and cold, and stiff, and uptight. - Hold on a second. Where is that coming from? I mean, are you trying to relax me or stress me out? No, I'm just saying, that's what I thought when I met you, but you are incredibly sweet. You're a good person. Very sweet, very kind. Very caring. You just have to set your face right, I understand. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What are you listening to on this thing? Makaveli. - Yeah, and two P-A-C? - Tupac. Tupac, yeah, I've heard of him. - The rapper guy. - Yeah, yeah. Makaveli. - I love this one. - Lindsey. What? Come on, it just started! There's nobody around! Come on! Lindsey, this isn't a bar. Here. And security will come up and ask what's going on, so, thank you. You care too much what people think. But that's cool. You gotta keep your face right, I get it. I'll be back later. You can use it. Get back to work. Three thirty-nine. You say something? Three thirty-nine. You asked me how much a gallon of milk costs. Its $3.39. See, the lesson in that was for you to find out for yourself, not ask somebody to tell you. - What's going on? - Child Welfare. She hasn't been attending school, you can't provide for her right now. - You're homeless. - I know, but... Look, get an apartment. Get back on your feet and I will personally help you get her back again. Do you promise? You have my word, ma'am. Please? Sweetie? I need your help. - Sweetie? - No. I'm sorry. Sweetie, just come with me. You'll be fine. No. Let go! Listen to me. Listen to me, baby, listen to me. I need you to be brave, okay? I'm gonna come see you every day. And this lady can give you some place to stay. Mommy just can't right now. - It's time, I'm sorry. - I'm not going! - I'm sorry, it's time. - I'm not going. - Officer? Give us a hand, will you? - No! No! - I'm sorry, you have to come with me. - No. I'm so sorry. Honey, I wish I didn't have to do this to you. Ariel. Mommy! No! Everything is just falling apart. And I been trying to hold on, you know. And the more that I was holding on, the more everything just fell apart. Lindsey, let me help you. Don't say that! You don't mean it. Everybody who's said that in my life has let me down. That's not me. I'm not those people. You know I can help you. You have to let me help you. There's a half bath there and one bedroom here. Another bedroom here. You need me to clean it? Clean? No. I want you to live in it. What? It's one of our corporate apartments, Lindsey. We've got a few of them. Nobody's here most of the year. You should... You can just live here as long as you need to. I can't. - Really, Lindsey, listen. - I can't. I know that you're proud. I know that you're used to doing everything on your own. Sometimes even the best of us, we all need a little help. So will you let me do this for you? Give to you? Does the phone work? Yeah, it does. So you're saying that I could call the social worker right now and I can tell her that I have a place to stay. Please. I don't know why you're doing this, but thank you. I better... I'd... I'm gonna get to work now. If you need anything, I'll be at the office, okay? Wesley. Thank you, thank you. It's okay. I thought I'd lost her. No, you didn't lose her. You're okay. - I thought I'd lost... - You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Thank you. - Okay. I'll be at the office. Or on my cell if you need anything. Make your call. Wait a second. Excuse me. How much does this cost? Mr. Deeds says it's free for employees. - Everybody? - Yes. You're gonna break this bed. We've only just got it! Oh, my love, look at you. Look at you! Gonna jump till I'm tired. Is this our apartment? For a little while. Come here. Come here. Now I know that I've been crazy these past few weeks. It's just that I was trying to help us survive. And I'm sorry if I didn't always treat you right, 'cause you always make me happy. Always. I love you, Mommy. I love you. I love you. This tie is too dark. Where are you going? To work. I started a Casual Friday. You know, last night, you... You made love to me like... Like... Like what? Like you were making love to someone else. Well, if I did that, then that would be unpredictable, right? Hey. Hi. Can I take you to lunch? Sure. Wes, who is this? This is Lindsey. I know you. - Where are you two going? - To lunch. Lunch? Wow! - I know, right? - That's beautiful. That is beautiful. Hey, Lindsey, come on. Get off this guy's bike. What are you doing? How are you so sure it's a man's bike? I don't care whose it is, you shouldn't be on it. Get off the bike. It's from Baker Boy's Bikes. I told them that you wanted to go on a test drive and they trust me. And your name carries a lot of weight, so here she is. Come on. This is your lunch. Put this on, so that you look cool. Are you serious? You were going like 100! I couldn't believe it. For someone like you, that's pretty wicked. Sorry, I... I just lost myself for a second. No, you didn't lose her. You're okay. - I thought I'd lost... - You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Thank you. - Okay. I'll be at the office. Or on my cell if you need anything. Make your call. You don't have to apologize for doing what you feel. It was good. - You think the road's really dangerous! - You are really... What do you think is gonna happen? Get hit by a car! You... Oh, my God, you are just such a worrywart! - You should just give it up! - You are a piece of work. No! Oh, my God! You're tickling me! - A piece of work. - I know I am. It's okay. I'm engaged. You're getting married. - Yeah. - Oh, God. I'm sorry. Then why are we... Why are we even out here? God! You know, the motorcycle, that was a really nice gesture. Thank you. Please. Please tell me you understand. Please. Congratulations. I gotta get back to my daughter. Damn! Where've you been? Left my phone on the desk. - You been trying to call me? - About 10 times. Sorry. What's this? Take a peek. There's no way. - He accepted it. - Oh, man. - Oh, man! - Yeah. - Oh, man. - Yeah. Whoa! You are all wet. Where did you go? Sorry. Man, you were worried, weren't you? - I don't think I was as worried as you were. - No. No one's as worried as me. Congratulations. This is the best news I've had all year. - Great job. Great job, John - Thank you. Our lawyers have the agreements. - I'm gonna call my mom and tell her... - No, no, no. Hey, look, let's... Let's get the agreement signed first and have everyone come here on Monday, then we make the announcement and celebrate. - Champagne in the office? - Sounds good to me. - Good idea. - Go change. I just got to tell you my father, Walter Deeds Senior, is smiling down from heaven right now on this moment. We took over his competitor and caused him a lot of stress over the years, so I'm very proud of it. I know my mother, Ms. Wilimena Deeds, is very proud of it. Thank you, everybody. And don't drink too much, four more hours of work left, okay? Hear, hear! - Hey, Lindsey. - You all having a party? My brother... I wanted to talk to Wesley, but I'll come back. No, no, no. He'd love to see you. Come on, he's right over there. Come on, come on. Hey, Wes! Wesley, look who I found. Hi. Lindsey, how are you? I didn't know this was going on. I'll call you. No, no, no. No. Don't leave. This is Natalie, my fiance. - This is Lindsey. - Hi! Great to meet you. You're gorgeous! Goodness. This is my friend Heidi and her husband John... - Who is she? - I don't know. I've never seen her before. Mother, you never see the help. She's a janitor. A janitor? Who invited her? Oh, apparently, your good son did. Hello. This is my mother. This is Wilimena, Lindsey. Hi. Lovely. - Lovely, you are lovely. - What? How long have you known my son? I don't know. Just a little while. You know he has a penchant for projects. Pen... What? Projects. He loves taking them on, renovating them. He buys small businesses, makes them bigger and better and then he sells them, and walks away. Did you suck all of the life out of her, Mom, like you do everybody else? You are drunk. Go home and sleep it off. No, no, Mother. Why would I do that? I'm gonna go get him off her. The only time you pay attention to me is when I cause a scene. Walter! And here's the good brother. You, doing everything everybody tells you to. You know, Mom, I did the deal. All right? I did it. I called Brunson and I went to his house and I made the deal happen. Okay. Why is everybody acting like you can't hear me? - I did this deal! - We know that, Walter. Okay. Walter, we know. We know you did the deal. Don't you dare look at me like that. I don't... I don't need your pity! Dad wanted me to run this company, Wesley, me! - And I can run it, Wesley! - Walter. Yes, you can, right into the ground, just like you run your life. - You go to hell! Take your hands off me! Where you going? Where you going? You're not leaving, you're not... Take your hands off me! Give me the keys! - Walter. - Give me the keys! - Stop them! - Oh, my God, stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop it! You okay? Isn't it ironic? We're all stuck here. Just like you're stuck in a career you don't even want. I hate you. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Hey. Are you all right? What happened? Come on. - Where's Ariel? - She's asleep. Oh, no. Don't do that! What are you doing? Do you even know what it is that you want? Am I a project for you, Wesley, is that it? You gonna fix me up, so that you can feel whole? You got all these people, they're all around you and they all envy what you got, but the truth is, look at you. You're not happy. You need to go and find what makes you really happy. Why don't you think you deserve that? That's why... That's why I'm here. You're not attracted to me. Look at me. I don't think I was ever really attracted to you. We're just both going through some rough stuff right now. Yeah, fine. You know what? I get it. You're not... You're not attracted to me, okay? I'm sick of people telling me how to feel all the time. I'm fine. Did you sleep with her? No. I don't think we're ready to get married. I know. But I love you so much. I love you, too. But it's not enough, is it? No. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you say something to me? Mob mentality. Our parents, our friends, everybody... "Oh, you guys are such a cute couple." We bought it lock, stock and barrel. I always thought I'd find a great guy, have him take care of me, raise a family, live happily ever after. I kind of figured out along the way that I like taking care of myself. You're the only woman I ever wanted to marry, have a family with, you know, it was just you. I don't want to have kids. And I know you always said, "No, baby, you'll change. You're just scared." I'm not scared, Wes. And I'm not gonna change. I don't want kids. You think that makes me a bad person, right? No. No. What if we're making a mistake, right? What if... What if we're wrong? What if I'm the best thing that ever happened to you? What if you're my Prince Charming? Or we're walking out too soon? Funny. You keep it. I love you, honey. Where have you two been? - Mom. - Never mind. - Mom. - Follow me. - I need to tell you something. - Yes, afterwards. Come with me. - Mom. Mom. - What? I need to... Come on. The people are starving. Hi. They're here. Everybody! The couple! I want to thank everybody for coming. But there's not gonna be a wedding. We're not getting married. What? We're not getting married, Mom. Wesley, can I talk to you? No. Wesley. I've lived for you and for Dad, lived his dream, but what about mine, Mom? I'm sorry. I'm... I'm leaving. Where are you going? Travel the world. Catch up with Rich, Josh. Okay. This motorcycle business again, right? No. It's about me living for the first time in my life. John is gonna run the company. I've talked to him, he knows everything about it. - So... - John? First Dad screws me over, now my brother screws me over? Nobody's screwing you over, man. Everything that's happening to you, you're doing it to yourself. You sabotage every good thing that comes in your life and I can't help you with that any more. That's who you want to be, you be it, but you won't be it with me. I'm done. Hi. Hey. You look great. Yeah, no tie. I just tried to relax myself a little bit. I'm so sorry about the other night. It's okay. No, it's not. I'm... I'm... I'm not gonna get married. And I'm leaving tomorrow. Where are you going? Africa. I'm shipping my bike there. I'm gonna catch up with my buddies and... No! Yeah. We're gonna dig those wells. That is amazing. Good for you. 'Cause you only live once, right? Yeah. You're right. You did... You did that for me. No, I didn't. You did it. There's an executive here, his name is John, and he knows everything about you and the apartment. You'll be fine. You can stay there as long as you need to. Okay. Thank you. I was kind of hoping that you wouldn't need to. Well, I... I'm doing both shifts and I figure that I could be gone in a month... No, that's not what I mean to say. Not what I'm saying. I got these two tickets here for you and Ariel, and I was just kind of hoping you'd go with me. I can't. Well, maybe I better just leave them there in case you change your mind maybe? No, I won't. I'm sorry. But thank you. Thank you for everything. Thank you for everything. I'll see you around. Be safe. Wesley. Came to talk me out of it? No. I came to see you off. I'm going to miss you. Wesley, I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. Be careful. Be happy. I love you, Mom. This your first time flying commercial? You say hi? Hi, Mr. Wesley. Hi, Ariel. All right, baby, go sit down. Now, look. A lot of times in relationships people don't say what they feel, 'cause they're afraid of being hurt or letdown. But I want to take this chance with you. Even though what your mother said scared me and I don't want to be a project for you, Wesley. I have Ariel to think about and... No. Mommy! Don't look. I don't know what's out there, or what's waiting for me, but whatever it is, I'm gonna find it.
