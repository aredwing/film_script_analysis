Hang on to your diapies, we're going in! Thats Tommy Pickles. Hes the bravest baby l ever knowed. And thats Phil and Lil. They like worms. And Im Chuckie. Im not so brave. Thats Okay, 'cause Ive got Tommy, and hes my bestest friend. Watch out! - Keep going! - It's right behind us! Tommy! Tommy ... Come on, Chuckie! Tommy, you kids shouldn't be playing in here. We thought the fun times would last forever. But we was wrong. - oh, my ... - Upsy-daisy, Didi. Thank you for inviting me to your baby shower, Mrs. Pickles. - Glad you could be here, Suzy. - What a pretty dress, Angelica. My mummy's assistant bought it especially for Aunt Didi's party. Don't say a word. $20 on 8 pounds, 6 ounces. Who's got 8-7? - 12 pounds, are you crazy? - You can't see she's gained weight. I mean, from behind. Look what we got for you. Boris, move your tuchis! A goat? Mum, you shouldn't have. Nothing better for her than goat's milk. Except maybe yak. But you try finding good yak these days. Here you go, Kinderlach, some chocolate coins. - Aren't you gonna eat it, Tommy? - Im saving it for my baby sister. - She finally came? - Not yet. But they're giving her this party, so Im pretty sure today's the day. Do you think she got losted on the way to the party? Maybe we should look for her. - Come on. - But she could be anywhere. - Watch it, pups. - Careful. - How's our little man? - Dr. Lipschitz says it's a girl. That windbag thought Phil and Lil were intestinal gas. - ''Riding high, it's a guy.'' - You know what they say: ''Born under Venus, look for a ...'' Dr. Lipschitz is the expert. None of you have a Ph.D. in Latin. Pig Latin, maybe. Let's just hope for Tommy's sake it's a girl. How my pups would squabble if they were both boys! Let's not do any gender stereotyping. After all, - - Stu and drew are brothers, and they get along fine. - Pushy! Bossy! - Lazy! Inconsiderate! - Why can't you listen to me? - We're talking about a real job. Im not gonna waste my life as a clock-punching, paper-pushing ... No offence. You got no insurance, no savings and another kid on the way. For your information, bro, I am working on something now - - that will put this branch of the Pickles family on easy street. - What now, an electric sponge? - of course not. That was last year. This is the Reptar wagon! The ultimate in toddler transportation. The perfect toy! In my day, we had plenty of fun just throwing rocks at each other. The Reptar Corp is holding a toy-design contest. The winner gets $500. There'll be plenty more if this toy is a hit. And Ill be famous! That's what you said when you built that stupid thing. Maybe Ducktar was a little complex. But this ... watch! I am Reptar. Hear me roar. I am Reptar. Hear me roar. Can't a man work in his own basement without getting barbecued? Okay, so maybe real fire isn't the best idea for a children's toy. Tommy, somebody's been colouring your room. Yup, it's for my new sister. - How are we gonna find her? - We don't know what she looks like. Well, she's a girl like me, so we know she'll be prettyful. You babies got a lot to learn about the facts of life. I must get back to the dessert table before the grown-ups eat it all. Angelica, can you help us find my baby sister? I wouldn't be in such a hurry. When she gets here, she'll get all the toys and love and attention. Your mummy and daddy will forget all about you. ''Look, Didi, there's that little bald kid in the house again.'' - My mum and dad won't forget me. - That's what Spike said. - Back when his name was Paul. - Paul? Then you came. They put him out in the rain and he turned into a dog. That's not gonna happen to me. My mum and dad will always love me. A baby is really neat a baby is a Special treat... Who does Suzy Carmichael think she is? A baby is a little dickens a baby is a cuddly chicken - A baby is lots of joy - A baby will get all the toys! - A baby has a smiley face - A baby is from Southside Space - A baby is extra fancy - A baby poops in his pantsies like a birdie Singing in a tree More like Reptar screaming in your ear A baby is a gift a gift from a Bob A baby is a gift from a Bob, Bob, Bob A baby is a gift... Do you really think babies are a gift from a Bob? lf Bob bringed a gift, it's probably one of them. - A baby is very special - A baby is not! - Betty, it's time. - Its time? oh, boy. Everybody to your stations. Charlotte, call the hospital. Didi, start your breathing. Good girl. Up we go, sprout. We got a Pickle to deliver. Now thats what l call a baby shower. Welcome to the Werner P. Lipschitz Centre for holistic birthing. offering the state of the art in primitive birth alternatives. Mrs. Pickles! You weren't due till next week. Well, we can try to squeeze you in. But Dr. Lipschitz promised us the Zen experience in the Tibetan Room. In my day, a woman dropped her baby in the potato field and kept going. Ah, yes, the old Country Room. - Do you have anything cleaner? - Maybe the Aquatic Immersion Room. She's having a baby, not a gefilte fish! Stu, Didi, Randy called to say you were on your way. l didn't realise you were bringing the whole party! - How far apart are the pains? - They're pretty much constant. - Didi, let's get you settled in. - Here you go, sprout. Don't worry, sweetie. Mummy's going to be okay. Gosh, Tommy, your mummy sure seems upset. Maybe your baby sister really is losted. - Maybe we can buy a new one. - Where would we find a baby here? - Got any queens? - Go fish. - Hey, a baby store! - Nice and wiggly. Help me pick one my mum will like. - Where am l? - Todays different than yesterday - So this is the world? - l miss my old womb - This world is something strange - l need a change - This world is something new to me - oh, my head! - What is this? l can't take it - me, either - Im hungry - l love the extra leg room - Man, they cut my cord - Consider yourself lucky - This world is way too big - And populated y s by fuzzy pigs - This world is something new to me - This world is such a gas - Wheres your class? - This world is something new to me - Can't a guy get some shut-eye? - Its so noisy in here l can barely hear myself suck! - The food here tastes pretty good - My compliments to the chef - You've got to holler to get fed - But l could get used to that - This world is way too bright - Turn down the light - So thats what it looks like - All things here are meant for play - its gonna be a real cool day - this world is something new to me Real cool ... this world is something new to me. There you are. Oh Gevalt! You kinder gave my ticker such a scare! All right, Didi, you can do it. Push now. Have we got a good reading on the EFM? oh, Didi, she's so beautiful. She's a boy. Hello, my wonderful, sweet baby boy. l guess we won't be naming him after my mother. - what about my cousin Dillon? - Dillon Prescott Pickles ... Dill Pickles. Yeah, l like it! Here you go, sprout. Tommy, l want you to meet someone very special. This is your brother Dillon. Dill, this is Tommy. Baby ... See? They already love each other. well, that's a start. what are we gonna do? He hasn't stopped crying since we brought him home. Somehow it's not as much fun here anymore. - what's your brother so sad about? - l don't know. But whatever it is, it must be really bad. - maybe he's broked. - what? - Broked! - Broked? He's not broked, he's ... just a little loud. That baby's getting on my nerves! Direct from Moscow, the Banana Bros Monkey Circus! Featuring the Most amazing Monkey Since Brezhnev. so Trotsky on down to the Banana Bros Monkey Circus! Grandpa, can we go to the circus? It's enough of a circus around here already! Sergei, you watch the monkeys. Ill get us coffee. No, Igor, you watch the monkeys. Ill get us coffee. No! The monkeys watch you. Ill get coffee. - Coffee's better in St Petersburg. - No, it's better in Kei. - Its better in St Petersburg. - Nothing's better in St Petersburg. Look! The train! Stop! Then the wizard looked down at the little boy and said: 'Your wish has been granted.'' And the little boy ... - Please, help! - Ill be back, sweetie. All l did was cough. l tried not to. But l coughed and now he's crying. And now he's got the hiccups. oh, Stu! - Sing Dill a lullaby. - Im too tired to sing. All right, Ill make something up. Baby, please, rest your head now it is time for bed - you're cuter than ... - Uncle Ned - Our little ... - quadruped. oh, Stu! It didn't work. He's still awake. Ive got one. Twinkle, twinkle how time flies Slowly in the Starry Skies baby, please, close your eyes - you're as Sweet as ... - apple pies as you grow and love and play in Our hearts you'll always Stay so Sleep and dream the night away That was good. baby, please, rest your head now it is time for bed please Stop, dont you see? l want Mum and Dad for me. Hey sprouts, a crate's no place for you to play. you might get shipped to Japan. Id better keep an eye on this. Dill, that's Tommy's blanket. yeah, it used to sleep with me before we even got you. - my blanket! - He's not very nice. That's not how you get things from a brother. Here, watch. - That's my Reptar, Lillian. - It is not, Philip. - It is tool - It is not. see, Tommy? Now you try it. - mine! - mine! Gosh, Dill learns fast. Hurry, Pop. They'll be here to pick it up any minute. why can't l watch Shirleylock Holmes at our house? Ill never be able to hear it with that new baby squawking. dad's got to work overtime, so mummy won't be so ashamed of his earnings. Hi, Uncle Stu, sorry to hear your pony is so slow. what pony? you told mummy Aunt Didi got saddled with a loser. - l ... - Excuse me. my tax deductions are crying. you can't deduct them if you don't have any income! Boys, what are you doing? Dill, what say we give Tommy a little turn with the bear? or not. Hey, champ, come with me a minute. I've got something to show you that's better than a teddy bear. we weren't going to give you this till you were older, - - but l think now is the right time. Grandpa put your picture inside. l know it's hard, Tommy. you have a little brother now, and that's a big change. They can be pretty tough to get along with. They aren't always what you hoped they'd be. That's why big brothers have to have faith. y youll see. He'll change. After all, youve got responsibility now. l know you'll stick by Dill's side and be a swell big brother. Sponsativity... - what is that? - A Reptar. - Unreal. what you think it's for? - l don't know. - we could ride to the baby store. - Great idea. we could take Dill to the hopsicle, and get Tommy's money back. - Tommy won't be happy about this. - well, he's sure not happy now. once Dill goes back to the baby store Tommy will be happy. l don't know about this. - what are you doing? - Lillian was ... we're taking Dill back to the hopsicle to get your money back. you can't. my parents want to keep him. - why?

Take it away! yeah, have a good day. Pipe down, Spike. me and Cynthia are watching ... Cynthia? Nice try babies, now give me back my ... Cynthia! They took Cynthia.

They were here a minute ago, playing in the ... The crate! Honey ... Im going to have to call you back. How could you fall asleep? you were supposed to be watching the kids. we'll never find the babies with this jerk in front of us. This is more fun than picking noses. l don't know if l should throw up or throw down. Ive turned this plane upside down, but there are no children. we found a kid, but he's not the one you're looking for. - Tommy. - Sprout. - Dill. - Angelica. - weve got to find them. - Find what? - Einstein here lost the kids. - l lost the kids? see? - where are we? - l don't know. - It looks like the park. - only bigger.

Let's stop playing around and figure out how to get home. we don't know where we are. - l know! Ive got my sponsativity! - what's a sponsativity? you get it for being a big brother. It's just like when okey-dokey Jones had to find his way home. - l thought that was a crumpus. - my dad says it's a sponsativity. where does it say to go? This way ... That's the way, straight up that hill! Bad dog! Stop! you know, not all dogs go to heaven. There he is! Mr. Pickles, is it true you shipped your own children to Tokyo? did a dingo eat your baby? How many pecks of pickled peppers did you pick? Childhood: a time of innocence. a time of joy. a time of unspeakable, unrelenting tragedy. Tell us how it feels to know you May never see your children again. - Can't you show some compassion? - So sorry. Please, tell us how it feels to know you may not see your children again. Let me at him. That crowd would indicate a yard sale or a family tragedy. Ill get back to you. How does it feel knowing your brother lost your only daughter?

Two sour Pickles. young Tammy, baby Dale, the twins, Bill and Jill, - - little Chunky and poor Amelia, all vanished without trace. Im Rex Pester and Ill be back with More big-action news.

Stop it, you're making me hungry. - oh, no! - we can't see your houses. we can't see any houses. we're doomed! doomed, l tell you! Mrs. Pickles, can you identify this binkie? This is all Dill's fault. Right, Chuckie? This never would have happened if you hadn't put him in the wagon. Its not our fault you got a naughty baby brother. He's not naughty. He's just ... a baby. How can you be mad just because ... ... you're standing there all naked? Im sure he's just trying to help. Its hot, exploring in the woods all day. A little breeze feels good. Just what l needed. Thank you, Dill. Those hiccups are starting to bug me. Face it, having a baby brother isn't what you expected. Look, somebody's house. Tommy was right. my sponsativity does work. who'd have a house way out here in the forest? maybe a lizard lives there. you know, a guy with a pointy hat that grants wishes. we just knock on the door and say we want to go home. - Everything will be back to Norman. - Thank Bob. Come on, guys. we're off to see the lizard. - Are you okay? - l just tripped in a little hole. It looks kind of like Spike's feet, if he was a giant. l saw a wolf make prints like that in a storybook, then he ate a girl. - The wolf ate a girl? - They got her out ... l don't think it's a wolf. lf it was, we'd hear him say ... - That was pretty good. - l didn't do anything. wolf! - do you see the wolf? - what does he look like? - Big teeth and furl And teeth! - No, Dill.

Dill, no! aqua Reptar engage. Im telling you, l saw a dragon. A big, green, fire-breathing dragon. Ive got to call headquarters. while you're at it, ask for a new assignment. Say, a city park. out here in the country you have to be a little tougher. - A dragon! I saw it! - Where? A wrapper from a Cynthia sweet bar. - my angel, she's been here. - She's tracking the sprouts. Its the Pickles blood. l myself remember tracking Sitting Bull ... over here! We found some wheel tracks heading into the woods. - They must be in my Reptar wagon. - you and your stupid inventions! my stupid inventions ... That's it!

Dill, no! l knew my Ducktar would come in handy. Pop, are you okay? do you think we'll still be able to find the lizard's house? Sure. As long as Ive got my sponsativity, we'll never be lost. which way are we supposed to go? That way. Look, footprints. maybe there's other babies around here. - Those are our footprints. - we're going around and around. - It was working before. - l don't think it ever worked. y our sponsativity is broke, just like your brother. - my brother is not broke. - He pulled the lever. He tried to send us into the big Jacuzzi. - Hey, you guys, look! - what is it, Chuckie? what's a train doing in the middle of the forest? maybe a giant baby losted his choo-choo. - what do you want? - Hungry. l want to go play with the monkeys.

The lizard can wish him back into a people. what if we only get one wish? lf you use it up on Dill, how are we going to get home? l have to wish him back. - you can't. - l can. - what if Phil turned into a monkey? - That's different. l like Philip. you'd be wasting your wish anyway, because that's not your brother. - wait a minute ... - what Lillian means is ... The monkeys took baby Dill. would you mind a baby monkey instead? - what? - Nobody like him, Tommy. we're going to find that lizard. Find your brother by yourself. - will you help me, Chuckie? - Sorry, Tommy. - But you're my bestest friend. - yeah ... Then how come, when l got thrown up on, you didn't help me? when l falled overboard, you didn't help me. when a monkey dropped me, you didn't care about my boo-boo. you don't got a bestest friend no more.
