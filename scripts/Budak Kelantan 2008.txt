Li, you shuffle. Life is not a competition. It's not important who win or lose. Life is just a test for us to be the best, greatest being... ...the same reason why we are being created human. The greatest human being... ...are the most useful and helpful. One, two... It's annoying to hear these wrestlers! Enough of that! Slei, shut off the TV. Why don't you play a Dikir Barat cassette instead. It's quite nice listening to Halim Yazid at this hour As the Prophet said, each of us is born with 'Fitrah'. 'Fitrah' means holy, clean, beautiful, before we tarnished by lies and sins. Meaning, when we were born, we were free from sins. Slei, take this money and go and buy some drinks. I'm thirsty. Coca cola, coca cola! Do buy some breads as well, I'm hungry. And turn off the TV! Hey! Where's the song? -Just wait... ...the cassette's still loading. There! Win again! Once there's a squirrel On top of a tree It has no tail, and hungry It's trying to find food It's trying to find food Once there's a squirrel On top of a tree It has no tail, and hungry It's trying to find food It's trying to find food Gods creation of squirrel A mammal from the jungle Gods creation of squirrel A mammal from the jungle Hopping from trees to trees It is the best Seldom fall, only if he's clumsy How clever the squirrel jumps, It could still fall down to earth A lesson to those wrongdoers Do not be so arrogant Do not be so arrogant Those days, we chased those squirrel away Afraid that the fruits might be stolen Those days, we chased those squirrel away Afraid that the fruits might be stolen Coconuts, durian, duku, if they're being tampered by the squirrels That year, coconuts, durians, would be unavailable for sale The whole village chased away that one squirrel Together they tried chasing it away, it is trapped. It is trapped. You're always on the phone. Better if we close for the day, Din. There's no more customer. It's late already. I have to go to Kak La's house tomorrow evening. My mom is here. She had just arrived this morning. You are always busy. Perhaps you don't miss me anymore. Hopefully it goes as planned. Until it's done. Please don't... Stop...stop stop....Hey You! You're bad! Are you ok? Did you run away from home? Why? Tell me. Or you don't know how to speak Kelantanese? Please tell me, I would like to help. I don't know where to go. What's the letter that arrived this morning, Din? Oh, there's an interview this Monday. Hopefully, I'll get the job. Why suddenly are you asking me about the letter? I saw the letter. Is that the same job that you've applied with Ppieja the other day? Yup. How about you Ppieja? They didn't call you? They only call for Buchek. Thankfully they called. Nowadays, if we don't know anyone inside, it's useless. That's all. I'll try for other jobs. Come along. Call Bbong and ask him to fetch you. Hey! That's my motorbike! One more thing, you have to be energetic. Energetic brings good fortune. But if you want to start anything, you have to start when you're young. Hey, you're asleep! I'm sleepy as well. Better if I sleep as well. Come. Are you afraid? Don't be...I am sincere. You've been following me all along and only now you're afraid, that's awkward. Are you staying here alone? Oh, they are all my relatives. They are good, they are. Come. Have a sit. If you're feeling sleepy, just sleep inside the room. There's the room. That's ok. I'm not sleepy yet. Maybe later. Don't you want to tell me what happened? You...running away... Let us talk inside the room. You go inside first, it's crowded here. I know you are not comfortable. Come, let me show you your room. Come. Come. How to change others? We can't. We can only advice them. Its up to them to change. If they do not want to change, what can we do? God's more superior and knows more. Why. Hey, I can't stand it. Let's make it easy, run. If possible, I dont want to meet up with those who knows me. If that's the case, you have to run away further. Like America? Try and think, now it's a new era. There are parents that want to restrict their kids. They never changed, just like the old days. Who told you so? I know how to differentiate which is good and bad. Let me have a look at you identity Card. Why? To make sure you are above 18 years old. I am. Give me your identity Card. I am already 18 years old. You know, I can bring you straight to the police. I did not do anything illegal. Ok, let's go to the police station now. What for? Because you are under aged and a runaway. Let me make a report and then let the police bring you home to your family, ok? Don't. Hey, the guy. That your father dislikes. That planned to run away with you but he didn't turn up... ...did he do anything to you? What? Are you still a virgin? Have you slept with him? You are frustrated because he lied to you right? That's why you run away. You want to understand the world? Take off your clothes. I want to show you how cruel is this world. Take it off. -Hey! What's wrong? You have did it with him, why not me? Because we're not married? I don't love you! What? Love? Hey, you don't understand what love is! You don't! Take off your clothes! Take it off! -Let go of me! Where can you go? Hold her! Let go! Hold her tight Piyei! Shut her up Meghei! Her mouth Meghei! Hold her tight! I'm passing this one. I prefer not to. Why? I'm not like you Jaha. You're Americanized you are different. I'll pass. I am. The hell with you! Your legs are bren! And still you want some. Is she kicks you... You can just hold her. Hold her to 'feed' you? No need. This type of sin, is not my game. There's a lot more that I can do. Just do what you want, I don't want to get involved. You get out. Get out. America! You need not worry. Let me be responsible. You can be my girlfriend. After all, you have no place to go, right? Let me help you. Can you send me to Klang Bus Station? I need to go to my sister's place. At Shah Alam, Section 28. Don't you want to be my girlfriend? -I just want to go to my sister's house. Ok, you just wait. Hello, where are you? Not sure whether I can or not. Like this, just wait for me. If its possible, it is. I will call you back. Come, let's go. I'm the one who called you sometime back. Don't you have any credit to tell me your answer? Im already here in KL, accompanying Ppieja to buy shoes. I thought of seeing my mom for just a while. I didn't know it would have taken so long. She has a lot of things to talked about. And she's having fever. It's a pity to leave her alone. Women, I only see them as a 'commodity'. Nothing more than that. If we know how to bargain, we can buy them cheaper. Are you sure you want to take care of me? Yes. Why? If that is the case. I don't think of going to my sister's. Are you sure you want to take care of me? I may get into trouble if I go to my sister's place. You said that you wanted to run away from your family, right? I was confused when you said that you wanted to go to your sister's. But, that's ok. I will take care of you. But you can't stay with me, cos we are not married. You can work first. My friend has a job opening. You can work there. Easy job. They'll provide a room for you. Would you like it? If so, I'll give him a call now. You work and stay there. There, we can always meet up. Wait, I'll call her then. Hello? Where are you? That's good. I'm somewhere nearby. There's one. Eighteen, Malay. Alright, we'll wait here. What's the price of a girl? Who puts the price? They themselves. Guys like me, we're just the motivator. People change. Whatever one's experiences are... ...whether he realizes it or not... ...the attitude will change. Whether they want or not. Hold my shoes for a while. Where are you going? Stomach pain. Wait here for a while. Hurry up. You are Buchek right? Don't you recognized me? Buchek right? Che Din, Che Nazarudin. Its me Azhar. Jaha, the village near the river. Jaha? You remembered. What are you doing here? I'm with a friend. Accompanying her to buy some shoes. How about you? This is my place. Are you here often? Never seen you before. I'm studying in UM, its been a while now. I've been to this place a few times but we've never bumped into each other. It's quite an embarrassment to write love notes. Since childhood. Love is not what we say but what we do. I don't believe in it for I have not felt it before. Now, I'm feeling it. For this first time, it's there. I would like to know, it's just that. I'm at the food area. With a friend. Are you done? Just come right up here. I'm already here. Buchek...you've changed a lot...Chek.. What kind of changes if you can still recognized me? Were you at Campbell? Were you there as well? You saw me? You didn't approach me? How could you. I thought you were a different person. You were with a girl. What if I was mistaken. That girl, is she your girlfriend? Which one? That kind of girl? That's not even close to my type Chek. Women are troublesome, Chek. It's difficult to find the true women. Those that I've met, all are haywire. Jaha, it's been quite a while since we last met. Yup. Since Pasuk Deraman's cow being slaughtered. This is Pieja. My university mate. Our hometown los different now. A lot of changes. Those old ones have long gone. Tchik Nuh, Maksu Mak Yam, who else? Paknik Him... ...one after another, passed away. Buchek, always in a fight together with me those days. Chek, stay at my house tonight? Tomorrow's weekend, Chek. Your house? Where is it at? Pandan Mewah. So, stay at my house? Ppeija? Hey, I can't. I have to go back. If Mat Min knows, he'll be mad. Why don't you just go ahead. I'll know what to tell him. It's fine then. We have a lot of catching up to do. -That's good Chek. I would like you to see my side of life. Let me call Bbong. He could pick us up with his car. My motorbike is under repair. A friend had an accident with it, bren legs. Now still at the workshop. Hello, Li. Can you pick me up at CM? We get those things. Then, where? Huh, better CM! Its difficult to park. Pertama then. Hurry up. Yes? Yes. I'll be there in the afternoon. Chek, let's go to Pertama Complex. He'll pick us up there. Then we'll go to Old Klang Road for a cough medicine. It's on me. Come. Hi. Hi. -Where are you going? Just walking around. May I borrow your pen? What for? -I just need it. Ok. You got a pen? -Yes, I do. Wow, if that's the case, can I get your number? Is that so? Do I have to give it? -Yes, you have to. Just take it then. What's the number? -012. Make sure it's the real one. -Yes. -374 -8082 -Ok. Alright, can I call you tonight? -As you please. Are you available tonight? -Yes, I'm available. Chek, I have never failed when it comes to girls. There's a lot of incidents here. A lot. I've been here for 7 years, Chek, and worked only for the first 2 years. Then I gave up work. If I don't have money... ...I'll ask from those who can give me. But, by selling girls I can make a lot, Chek. I'm always lucky with girls. I'm always easy to get girls. First, I'll take them on my own... ...and then I'll sell them. Before that, I do bad things, including stealing from the illegal immigrants. I've done it all. I was two months at the boarding school. When I came back, you were not around. Heard that your family moved out to Kuala Krai. I was there for 3 years. Too many cases. Until the disciplinary teacher at school got fed up with me. Once, at the Night Market, I had... ...a fight using this big buckled belt. Another friend of mine Juan, fought as well with his fist. I was so into the fight with a guy... Then I realized there was a knife involved. But I didn't think much. I beaten him using the belt. The guy ended up in a really bad shape. Police! Police! Police! Then what? Did you run away? Yes, far far away. I was caught and sent off to Henry Gurney. Pna told my Mom that I was in a fight. Police came to my house because the guy whom I had the fight with... ...was in a critical condition, he was stabbed by a knife. You stabbed him? I don't remember, since I was really into that fight. Maybe it was me or Juan. Or maybe one of his group members. So pissed off, stabbed his own friend in order to blame me. Crazy guys! But it was old story. Juan had passed away, he got hit by a truck. He's into glue sniffing and getting high. He ran in the middle of the road... ...when the lorry ran into him. Horrible incident. Is Pertama Complex your area? Who is the head here? Whoever that's brave enough. I want to tell you. In case we meet again some other time and I didn't approach you... ...I'm not snobbish. There might be trouble that l don't want you to get involved. Why? There might be someone out there trying to hit on me. If I'm with you, maybe together we will end up being hit. Bbong is late. Hello Li, Where are you? I'll go and play some video games first. Call me when you're here. If you can't go out, what can I do. I can't scold them, no point, it's their rules. No need to promise. Later, if you can go out, I'll wait for you wherever you want. For once, I would like to see peace. Since childhood I've never felt peace. Just like a hunter feeling great while seeking his prey. I'll seek peace but I'll ruin it. You may spit on me. I'm not sure whether to laugh to what I'm writing here. I'll still write. Chek, run Chek, run! Can we stop for a while, at any nearby mosque. It's already late, I haven't pray yet. Just pray at Nuar's. It's just nearby. Li, stop Li. There's a mosque. You want me to stop on a Highway? Just make a turn. It's late, look at the time. Asar is near to end. If Nuar's place is just nearby. I'll just do my prayer there then. Li, I said stop! You are ridiculous! Stop near that tree! You just go and have your prayer. It's hard to cross the road. Hope it's fine with you. What about you? You just go ahead, will be there later. Bbong won't go anywhere, he'll wait here. However bad we are Li, don't held the others to do good things. I'm so confused. Who's that guy? Where is he from? He's a childhood friend. But our life and his, is totally different, Li. I don't think he's American enough if we get along with a good guy. I still remember my childhood days. I was so close with him. And we always throw stones at Paksu Deraman's buffalo. But why humans are stupid, wrongdoers and sinners of the world? Something. Somehow. The Circle. A circle of thoughts that taught them the imbalance. Jamal, Kamal, Yin, Yang. Just open the gate. No need to peek around? Mr. America! Wait for a moment, I'll take the keys. We have the phone, call him first. We'll do it the good way. I'm just testing your patience. Let you be a bit concerned. That's my place. You better sit on the floor. We're not in a hurry right? Why? The thing is not here? You did say you had it. Yes. It's difficult nowadays. There's crackdown and rush everywhere. Heavy crackdown? Or was it you? Taking it by yourself. I'll take those words as mine. No need to give to Nuar. I did this business once, in just a matter of seconds. Bought three gallons, for stock. Two gallons for my own use and sold only one. I'm not suited for this kind of business. Then, where is it? Let's not talk nonsense. Feed him up Nuar. Let all those words get out from his mouth. How much do you want? How much per gallon? Wow! A gallon? I mean, you were saying that it's difficult to get stocks. I'll do the math of one bottle when I know the price per gallon. A bottle? Hey..wait you. We haven't discuss yet. What's wrong with you? Are you high already? A bit high. I guess. I don't go for these. Then what? You got pills? I can take those stocks from your area. You may ask here. From whom? Pakda? He got those stocks yesterday. Quite a lot. Li, we can go there afterwards. Can't we get it from you? I can sell it at a different price. My car needs fuel. You too fussy even with friends. Enough if you just take a little bit of profit. Stingy. Those groups, making a havoc all over. I'm pissed off Which group are they from? Kelantan? Outsiders. Just hit them. Don't let them step on you. You always think that other people love fighting like you do. You're an American gangster. Look at him, Wa. Look at his outfits, so Americanized. America, don't you know Li? His address is written like this. Meksoh shop, Slow Mengkuang Village, Kuala Kerai, Los Angeles... ...California, America! I've been waiting 40 years here. Better for you to get those things. How much do you want? A gallon? A bottle is more than enough, a quarter each for the three of us. How do you calculate that? A quarter each for three? His math is a drunken man's formula. Hurry up Wa, stop smiling, or else I'll rob you. A bottle Wa. You're a bit quiet Chek, not yourself. I don't know anyone, that's why I remain silent. The balance is mine. Greedy. More than that it's yours. That's it. I'll take it in it's pure form. No worries. Now Chek. Today you have to accompany me Chek. Hey, I can't. This is not a sin. It's medicine for discussing multi-million business deals. I have not prayed yet. These things won't let you forget, it's not liquor. Drink up Chek, accompany me. It has been 13 years... If you don't drink, I won't as well. For we won't be talking at the same 'level'. Just be a good follower... It does not taste any difference, right? Wa, can I pray for a while here? Yes sure, go in that room. Everything's there. Kiblah is as the same direction as the opened window. Would you want a sarong? That's. My pants is still alright. I'll just go and pray first. You guys are stupid. Don't force if he doesn't take it. Did I force him? If he doesn't want it, its fine with me. He's nervous inside there. Let's just see if he's sober when he's out. How much Wa? A quarter Rm25 each, all together RM100. I'm selling at RM30. If you add another RM10, it's better. If not I won't get any profit. Here it is. That's what I call friend. Why is it that we need to follow? Are we not strong enough? What weapons do we have? Should we just... ...confront with everything? Show us the true path. The paths that lead to goodness. And not those paths... ...that lead to sin. You are not like this before. Is getting old makes you a silent person? What? Are you high? We forgot to take the pills from Nuar. We'll drop by at Pakda's house first, Li. What? I want Buchek to realize something. Those cough medicine doesn't work on him. How to talk about business? Greetings. Yes. What's up? I'm inside a car with my old friend. I won't be coming back to Tmn Tun tonight. I'll spend the night with my friend. An old friend from my hometown. Yes, I can, if you want to. Evening? Always turning on wrestling. Isn't there any other movie that you can watch? Have a sit Chek. Get comfortable. If we are not watching wrestling, what to do? Tell me what to do? There's other good things than you can. -Like what? The snobbish one... ...is Wak Junuh. That's Piyei, he loves Budu. He loves to be in the limelight. Whenever he hears his name, he's be around. This is Meghei Cikgu. Does he look like a teacher? Funnily he's not. Just a storekeeper! Pergilah. Tu, dalam bilik aku. Breaking the ice. This is my childhood friend, Buchek. Let us break the ice by playing cards. It's weekend and there's nothing to do. Bring the decks out. Chek, come and join us. Heh, I don't know how. That's, I can teach you how. Can I pray first, for a while? Go on. You can use my room. Piyei! Are you deaf? He's so into it. Run! Over there. It Hurts. You Crazy. Let's get those pills, more fun with the decks. Pills? Get it ready. Li, get some water Li. Get some water...water.. Get some water. But when we believe that the night will have its daylight. Then we have to be brave and do it for God. Just like Prophet Abraham, God summons him to slaughter his own son, Ismail. Where did you get the money to buy these chocolates, Lei? He must have stolen these chocolates from Seven Eleven. Give me one. It's gone. What else to do now? What to do? If there's a girl here, it would be fun after all those pills. We didn't do anything wrong. Just sightseeing looking at the morning scenery. Li, just go a bit closer. I want to see it closer. Over there? Ha, slowly. You're crazy! Open the door Chek! You're losing your mind. We're in deep shit, the fuel is nearly empty. You're stupid. Why didn't you check earlier? I didn't know that we'll go this far. Now what? You're the stupid one. Now what are we supposed to do? There's a petrol station right in front. Then you want me to go inside... ...and show everyone what's inside the car? You are damn stupid. Just park further up and continue by foot. You need me to go and buy it? Yup. Just park right in front there. Are you sure it's enough? Yes. Enough. I'll just stop here okay? A little bit further... Jaha, what's wrong with you Jaha? There you go. Stop. Chek, hold her hand for a while. Money... money... Hold on. Here's the money. Let go Chek. Whatever you do. I don't want to get involved. Just go! Damn it! I need to pee. Chek, can you hold her for a while? Hold her! Just hold it tight. Shut her mouth so that she won't scream. Shut it! I'm going to pee. Miss. Listen up Miss. Don't scream. I will let you go, okay? Don't scream. If you scream they will hear! You can go quietly now...Don't struggle. You can go now. Go! Go now! Go! There's a taxi, stop the taxi. Taxi! I don't have any money... Here's some. Just go now. How can I pay back? No need to pay. No need! Just go! Give me your number? Here Just go, hurry up! Stop the taxi. You can go now. Hurry... Hurry! Where is she Chek? I let her go. What a lost! Li, Stop Li. You get out now! Get out, Get Out! Move it! Piyei, can you sleep nicely. He let her go just like that. What if the girl reports about the incident to the police? Stupid guy. You childhood friend right? But what he did was right. He shouldn't be among us. He's different. I'm getting my motorbike this evening. Easier to get girls. Hey you... I think I know you... Please wait... I would like to get to know you... Hey, who are you calling? Calling who? Calling... me? What's wrong with you? Just for a while. I like to look at you. Give me a number... please... Give me a number? Will you? Just a number... What are you doing here? Abang Din, why didn't you pick up the phone? You just keep quiet. He disturbs me right from the parking lot. If he knows you're my Girlfriend, he would not have disturbed you. I'm not just saying it just for my sake. What about the others? It's wrong! And you just kept quiet. As if you're not my boyfriend. It hurts... Let me drive? Nor, he's my childhood friend. I know but his way is totally wrong. If it is, just try and listen to me. I'm still hurt inside, you know? I'm disappointed that you did nothing... Please don't do that. Hello, Chek, it's me Jaha. I'm really sorry about that incident. You did not tell me that you had a girlfriend. I'm really sorry that I disturbed her. How long have you known her? What's her name? Norlalili? She's good. I'm a bit shy of you now. I'm sorry for calling you abruptly. Let's meet up. We can talk more. Excuse me. Hello? Who? Lee Chen Chen? Oh, the incident this morning. Hello Chek. What are you doing? Let's meet up? For burger. Chek, let's go out? Bring Che Nor along. I have something to tell her. I would like to give an apology. Yes, I know she's your girlfriend. That's why. Ha! Ha! Ha! What? Which dog has bitten you? My auntie called. She told me that my sister is in trouble. Where? -Sri Gombak. Wait up. Chek, I really would like to see Che Nor. But I have something to settle now. I will call you back. So, do you want to go and look for her? Yup. Let's go. Go and get your helmet. What I would like to tell you might be a little bit different. It was like a dream. I was kidnapped and being rescued by a Prince. It's like in a fairy tale. Prince? You are a little bit over the top. We've been living for so long now. But we haven't known each other better. You are like a mystery that I would like to seek. Two mysteries. Why am I meeting you? Yati! Yati! He held me up! He's tall, dark and big. I think I know him. Let's go. Hit him Meghei!! It's difficult. Difficult? That girl is yours. If you love her, you won't let her go for others. I do love her. But don't we have to love God more than anything? That Jaha guy, is he for real? Does he really like Nor? Is her for real? Din, Nor loves you and the choice is all hers. But I think that I have to help Jaha. Go and talk to Jaha. I'll go and have a drink somewhere else. I don't even know you. I can't accept you. I have a boyfriend already. Enough of this nonsense! Let's go back. Recently I went Cheras to get some "fruits". I'm really into those "fruits" now. What fruits? Those "fruits". -What fruit? Apple? Not apple! The pills. Usually I bought it for RM25. Those guys selling it at RM20. I took it. When I'm home getting ready, its cannabis. What for! What are you looking at? Huh? What? -Or you want to fight? Get him, get him! If you dare, let's fight one to one! Run! Run! Run! He kept it in his pocket. You got to tell me the truth. How its going to be? Nor, just accept Jaha. But why? I have promised everything to you. But, I feel like you are better off to be with him. Don't cry in here. That's why I don't want to come here. Why Abang Din? Why do you always think of others? Why can't you concentrate more on yourself? Rice! Fried rice again! Ha, eat those rice. Let's eat. Get the spoons Lei...Where's the change? Hey, that's my pants. Hello. Hello. Chek. How was it? If it's difficult, just give me her number. Then? Please try so that I can meet Che Nor. When? That's even better. A Dikir Barat concert, good. Let's go together. I'll go to your house. Give me the address. Hold on. Ha! Ha! Ha! What is it? -You have to run, quick! Why? What's wrong? -The police are looking for you! Someone called up saying that the police are looking for you near the junction! Are you for real? -Hurry! Run! You left your friend there, is it okay? If he's there at the house looking for you, no one will be around. I tried to call him. No one picks up. Let's not worry about him. He said he wants to meet up with Che Nor. Aren't we too early? The concert starts at 8pm right? We're avoiding the traffic jam. Maybe Jaha had gone straight away to UKM. Who's this? Hello? Greetings to you. Li? Bbong? What's the matter? Nor, Jaha has gone. Accident. He told me that he wants to meet you up tonight. Can't you still see Nor? This is fate. Like the insect chasing the light. When it goes to the lights, it dies. He called just to meet you. To seek for an apology. Is it difficult for you to forgive him? You ask me to be with him! You should try to understand! A thousand meanings The millennium starts Continuing the colors of races We stand as one With dignity Molding our own culture A thousand meanings The millennium starts Continuing the colors of races We stand as one With dignity Molding our own culture We've been locked for so long In complete darkness In the shades of the meridian Until the growth of our roots of culture A thousand meanings The millennium starts Continuing the colors of races We stand as one With dignity Molding our own culture The feeling of going far away from everyone, and everything. The life that I've upheld. I have to follow no matter what. Realizing it or not, it's my lost. You should win Chek! Win to understand. THE END
