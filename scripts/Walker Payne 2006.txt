You promised us two more years. It's the government. That government gonna feed my kids? The sulfur content's too high. Now, move along. What about the contract? Come on. Let's get this over with. WRQZ. Southern Illinois' number one radio station. We got news they shut down the number 17 mine today. Hey, Walker. A lot of good men lost their jobs. Well, here's a song that might cheer them up. Can I help you? How's Bob? Poor man's out of town all week. Well, I got the girls this weekend. Well, you know where to find me tonight. - Damn it, Brute, get down! - Don't cuss in the bank, Thompson. Slobbered up Mrs. Murphy's loan app. Maybe Mrs. Murphy needs a little slobbering. - What do you want? - A big, fat personal loan would be nice. Well, then maybe cash this for me then. For the last time, I'm not your personal teller. Go see Audrey. Audrey? New. From Chicago. Don't. I'm sorry. Who are you? He never ever does that. Just... He won't bite. Bad dog. Very bad dog. Get up. Come here. How may I help you today? Well, I recently acquired this broach. So, I thought maybe I'd get a safety deposit box for that, or hold on to it, 'cause it is awfully pretty, very pretty. How may I help you? Well, Audrey, you can cash my paycheck and close out my account. Please. Chicago, huh? Mr. Payne, you only need $20 to keep the current account you have, that way you wouldn't have to come back and reopen. And you'd earn interest on your money. Do you have that memorized, or they got that written down there somewhere? You don't have boys like me up in Chicago, huh? We do. We just don't brag about it. Now, would you like to close the account or not? He says whichever takes longer. Oh, shit! Son of a bitch! It's hot! Girls, get in your room. - What's wrong? - Come on. Just get in your room. - Mom! What did we do? - Move. Now keep your mouth shut and stay in this room. - Where's the girls? - They ain't here. You don't have to come speeding up to the house, kicking up dust... Lou, just the girls. Like a damn teenager. They're spending the night at Marlene's. - What does that mean? - You heard me. It's my weekend. Until you start paying child support... Support? You got everything I have here. - You are not gonna see those girls! - I get one weekend, Lou! Not this weekend. You go over there, I'm calling the sheriff. Have you locked up again. That's Daddy. I wanna see Daddy. Can't keep this up, Lou. I sure as hell can. - No, you can't. - Yes, I can. Until you start paying some child support, maybe you should take some... It's all I got. That's everything. I got shit-canned, by the way. They say when they'd start digging again? They won't. - Ever? - Over. So, now what's the plan? It's Dad. Stay. You're gonna shoot me with my own gun now? You are not getting near them, Walker. Christ. I'll be back. Go. I'll be fixing that when you're gone. Think he'll trust you? Well, if they've been on their own for a while, they forget how to ask for help. It's faith and patience. See you're busy as ever, huh? More strays to come, what with the layoffs and all, dog's another mouth. Might get kind of tough, you handling this all by yourself. Just like your dad, afraid to ask a direct question. Well, I'd be happy to come back, help you if you need it, Chester. Well, last time I gave you Brute's momma in trade. Don't suppose you'd take the same wage this time, would you? Well, I can't. It's Lou. She's on me about child support. I don't have it again. You helped in making them. She's keeping my girls from me, and I... Just kind of hoping maybe you could loan me a little money. Any money I loan you is coming right out of their mouths. That ain't fair. You can get your girls back. All you have to do is crawl out from under every skirt in town, make things right with Lou Ann. She wouldn't have me back. Everybody in town knows Lou Ann would take you back in a heartbeat. Besides, she can't take your girls away from you if you're under the same roof. Come on, guys. Come on. Pink slip, you get in free. Batter, batter, batter, come on. Let's go! You wanna put something down on the game? Well, how much can I win with this? Well, I've been laid off myself. It's a Colby dog, ain't it? That's right. He has strong bloodlines. Fantastic animal. Georgia? Panhandle. Come all the way up from Florida just to compliment my dog? Well, I see a man with a pink slip and a Colby dog, I see me an opportunity. What do you say we skip the Shinola? Suit yourself. Strike three! I knew a fellow once who had a Colby dog. Son of a bitch would take it into a bar and bet that he could skin it without it making a sound. You believe that? He'd hook the whole crowd. Jack the price up, $200-$300, easy money. And then he'd pull his knife out and he'd run it down that dog's spine from the hip right up to the base of the head, and he'd peel the hide back 'round its belly. God's truth. Dog never whimpered. Well, I ain't suggesting that you skin him. I'm just saying pit bull don't feel no pain. They're fighting dogs, and there's money in it. Goddamn sea of green. Your dog's born to fight, Coal. It's in his blood. Yeah. Are you sure of that? Yes, sir. As sure as I am old Springfield here gonna win this thing. Oh, yeah. Hmm? This town's got nothing for a hustler. Hey, what's your problem? Back off! What's happening, guys? Take it easy. Goddamn filthy mutt. Don't push my dog, Stew. What are you gonna do about it? I'm gonna buy you a drink. You guys need anything over here? Buy him his drink. Necks. A surprise, huh? You know, you can't be cutting school. Your momma's gonna be mad. - She's always mad. - Hey. You and Sarah know better than to talk bad about your mom. By the way, she can hear you, no matter how far away she is. Trust me. Oh, I got a surprise. Sit down. A little surprise. Close your eyes. Guess what I made you? Is it a house? Is somebody peeking? Ta-da. Hey, and you can paint each wall a different color if you want. What do you say? - Thank you, Daddy. - Thank you. - Thanks, Marlene. - You're welcome. Girls, take Brute out back and play. Brute. Damn school called the diner, like I can't raise my kids. Now I'm out a half a day's tips. You're affecting my job now, Walker, and if you are not gonna start paying... I didn't tell them to cut school. No, but you gave them a damn toy, just like saying it's okay. Why not bring groceries, huh? 'Cause little girls don't say "I love you" for a can of peas! I'm not the bad guy here. No, Walker, I am. Because you force me to be. Because you force them to cut school to see their daddy. I gave you the house. You got the girls. What more do you want from me? I want child support! I want my life back! You think this is all I wanted, huh? You dragged me away from my friends, my sister. You dragged me here and you dumped me off in this shit-hole town. I had plans before you and the girls. I was going to do something with my life! Then do it! With what, Walker? With two kids and my goddamn tips? Can't start over with that. I'll take the girls. Oh, yeah, you're good at taking. You gonna take the time to sew their hand-me-downs, huh? You gonna pack their lunches, huh? You're going to stay up with them all night when they're sick, huh? You're gonna take the humiliation of standing in line waiting for shots at the free clinic? I want the girls! I want the girls! That is exactly why I won't give them to you. Why can't we be with you? The judge tells people what they can do and what they can't do. He says I can see you, but I can't keep you. But you're our daddy. And, chipmunk, sometimes Daddy's got no choice. Can't we just go somewhere, without Mommy? We don't need to do all that. I told you, we're gonna move away. Daddy's got a plan, have his own business, gonna be his own boss, and we'll have ourselves that house. The one with a swing set? And a swimming pool? Swimming pool, swing set, tree house, anything you want. How are you gonna get that? Well, they're building thousands of miles of highway out west. Thousands. And they're gonna need a lot of concrete, and they're gonna have to buy that from your daddy. But you don't have any concrete. I'm working on it. All right, now get in the truck. Let's get you back to your mama. Oh. Well, hello. Brute. You know, he looks like a gentleman, but he's really a dog. I hear he gets it from his daddy. Oh, yeah? Oh, you've been asking about me. Oh, I know about you. You've slept with every girl in this town but me. You live from check to check without a care, or a bank account for that matter. Someday, you're gonna knock up one of these girls and there'll be another one of you to hassle the next generation. Luckily, I won't be here to see it. This town's a pit stop. I have? Have what? Slept with every girl in this town, but you. You've been asking about me. Hold on. I'm coming. It's early. Why two kids? Hmm? Why Beth? Why Beth, what? Sarah was an accident, but why Beth? Is that why you came over here? Look, I can't be late, so just answer the damn question. I wanted kids. I always wanted kids. But not a wife. You got pregnant. I did the right thing. For you. You're not getting a fight. It's nice. I ain't in it. You promised them a life they want, and I ain't in it. I can't do this anymore, Walker. Do what, Lou? I want out of this town. I decided I'm going to go to nursing school. It's what I should've had. And tuition and a few months rent for an apartment comes to $4,980. And I can't get that together. You give me $5,000, I'll let you have the girls. Lou, I don't have $5, let alone $5,000. Well, get it. I'll have it notarized through the lawyer, everything. There's proof the truck's paid up. And Chester even wrote a letter of reference. Lou in nursing school? Yeah. Better hope you don't get sick. Neither one of you is solvent. If Lou Ann sold the house, she'd barely have enough to pay the second mortgage. That's why I'm here. I want you to give me the loan, Thompson. You have no job, Walker, no bank account. Job? I got three job offers yesterday. There aren't three open jobs in the whole town. Hey, October the 17th, the Carmi game. Down five, fourth and long, and I throw a tight, straight spiral and you... Dropped it. Yeah, I know. This ain't about high school, it's about right now, and it's about money. And I can get Beth and Sarah. Come again? I give Lou 5 grand, she gonna give me back my babies. Now, I know that you can get me the money... That's illegal. - How can you even ask... - Don't talk legal... I need your help. For Christ's sake, Sarah's practically your goddaughter. This is a business, a financial business, and financially you don't exist! I'm good for it and you know that. There is no bank in the world that's gonna loan you $5,000, least of all mine. Not in my bank, Walker. - Let's go. - Is everything all right? Lou is out of line. You don't need a loan, you need a lawyer. Fuck lawyers and fuck bankers, 'cause you're all back-stabbers, every single one of you. You're right, I have nothing, and I am nothing. Maybe I don't exist, but my daughters do. And I'll get them back without you. You fuck. Get that dog out of my bank, Walker. You might need these. I'm sorry about your daughters. Just two more of me to hassle the next generation, right? Can you get those bugs off the windshield? Yes, sir. It must take a lot of money to keep an old wreck like this rolling, huh? Or just a little hard work. You should try it. Now look it, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, Coal. I'm gonna give you $400 for that pit bull. How's that? He's not for sale. Everything's for sale, Coal. Pit bull's born to fight. Now you wasting that dog on beer and laziness. He knows he's not living up to his potential, just like you know you're not living up to yours. You should get going. I'll get by. Too poor to paint and too proud to whitewash. - How much? - A quarter. - Thank you. - Bye. $15 from Mrs. Murphy there. She bought the dresser. I'm gonna help her load it up. Over here, Chester. Hi. Well, all my fancy stuff went this morning. Thompson told me where you lived. I wanted to apologize for misjudging you. You stay in the car, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Daddy. Hi, Daddy. Making money or wasting time, huh? Well, you think I can kiss my girls before you start... You don't go near them, Walker, not until you pay. - Got a big customer. - Excuse me. Thank you. - Hey, hey. There's my two little angels. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. You sure as hell ain't gonna get my money selling this junk. I'll give you $20 for this lamp. Sold. Don't go trying to keep stuff from me. - Bye-bye, baby. - Bye, Chester. Bye. I don't even think this thing works. Good. It'll look better in the dark. We do have an exchange policy. It's Drexel. 3575. This'll almost cover what you owe me. What are you gonna do about next month's rent? I use to come here as a kid all the time. Those monster movies were my favorite. Probably because you were a monster yourself. Choirboy, all the way. I used to be able to sit by myself for hours and not get into any kind of trouble. I find that hard to believe. My dad used to take me here. He'd disappear as soon as the movie started. I had my Coke, popcorn, eat one piece at a time, perfectly still, until he'd come stumbling back in the middle of the second feature, smelling of beer or perfume, half out of his clothes. He'd hop in the truck and we'd drive home. And I mean we. He needed that third hand on the wheel. What about your mom? Oh, he'd run her off by then. She's probably still running. We can't pick our parents. Poor bastard got caught trying to beat a freight train at a crossing. Found pieces of his truck and beer cans about half a mile down that track. Turned 13 about a week later, and moved in with Chester. You wanna know the best thing about coming here? You can change the movie anytime you want. What do you want to watch? You know, some dapper man in a tuxedo sweeping away an innocent girl to New York or Paris to live happily ever after. Really? Is that where people go to live happily ever after? You wanna get a drink? Coffee? - I haven't unpacked my percolator. - Oh. I see you heard about me and the ladies. No, no. It's true. All right, well, you let me know before you leave town so I can see you again. Does that line ever work? Twice. Choirboy. I told you. If you don't pay support judge will put you back in prison. I'm not going back inside, ever. I got nothing else to give you. Not asking. I don't see you making No. Not legally. You like jail that much? There's some talk of coal work in Missouri, I guess. Just talk. You leave the state on parole, they will put you back in jail. See what you're saying, right? I can't stay. I can't leave. I got to do something. 'Cause I feel the whole world is just... Well, it's keeping me from my girls and everything else. World didn't make your choices, son. Okay. And? Gotta start thinking maybe you're not gonna get the girls. Sometimes I'm tossed and I'm driven And know not where to roam I've heard of a city called Heaven I've started to make it my home Lord's word is that I see coming My blood's running cold and slow But Jesus came quiet to Jordan And piloted me through as I go Good acoustics. All right, it's a 16 by 16 foot square, wood walls, 2, 2.5 foot tall. Now, opposite one another in the corners, about three foot from the corners, is what you call the scratch line, right in here. Now in this little triangle is where you're gonna be handling your dog. Send him over here. Here, boy. Okay, kneel. If a dog turns his head and shoulder away from his opponent, you call that a "turn" to the ref. If he acknowledges it, you scratch your dog. And a scratch determines how game your dog is. All right? All right. Now, when the opponent lets go of his dog, you hold Brute behind the scratch line. Then you'll see if the dog's gonna cur out or if he's game. Now, a scratch dog has to go after his opponent. If he don't, he loses. What made you come around, Coal? Does it matter? Not to me, it don't. Now, look, his chain-weight's about 53 pounds. For the pit, you're gonna have to bring him down to 46. I know an old man outside of town's got a kennel. No. You and me are the only ones who know about this. Suit yourself. You don't have to worry, Coal. I take care of my partners. We're gonna have to work on his bite and his stamina. I'll walk you through that. He's an athlete now. What do I call you? Syrus. Just plain Syrus. Come on. Come on. You spoil him, Coal. I throw this out there, you go get it, you bring it back to the dry land, to me. That's the idea. All right? Make me proud. Right here. Well-trained animal right there. You know about this place, right? This whole thing used to be a stripper pit. It was a torn up, ugly gash in the earth. Rains came, filled it up, turned it into this. It is amazing though. You know, I mean, you give anything enough time and it can become beautiful. Come on, boy! Come on! Come on! That's it! That's it. Now we're talking. Watch your dog. Sorry. I want bacon and eggs, crisp and over-easy. You can actually cook? - You take the plate, I'll take the pan. - We'll share. - Oh. - No! He can't eat today. He's going to the vet. Maybe after that we could do something, shopping for plates? I'm probably going to be gone until late. At the vet? Yeah. All day at the vet? That's right. Lies won't work with me, Walker. If this is about Lou Ann, then tell me. Tell me now. It's about my girls, and that's my business. Mine alone. Yours alone. You didn't say it was in Kentucky. Yeah, well, it's a felony to fight dogs in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan. Law don't understand the sport. Kentucky's got a little more progressive mentality. Only the gambling part's illegal. You best loosen up, Coal. These people don't like jittery folk. Syrus, I never expected to see your ass around here again. Got Walker Payne with a Colby dog. Syrus is here with the kid. You got the big money down? Straight ahead, over there. Folks down here don't seem to like you much. Well, nobody likes a winner, Coal. Why don't you take him over there and empty him out? Get everything out of his system. Forty-five and a quarter pounds. Good going. You made the weight. - Take care of Brute? - He's in the car. Why am I washing this dog? Just in case he worked poison into the coat. Every once in a while you come across a barbarian. Now look it, your take is gonna be 250, after I get my cut. Take it easy. This dog's bound to lose. Now if your mother leaves you here Grief and sorrow you must bear And you feel the only friend you had is gone But whenever you feel alone Jesus will take you in his arms Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there Leave it there Oh, leave it there Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there - Hey, Doc. - Hey, there, Doc. Grandpa, my good luck charm. Well, Bradley, I'm glad you brought a lot of money. A Colby dog, I heard. Here we go! Thirty seconds in the corners. And 10 seconds to scratch. All right, look, encourage him, but don't distract the other dog. Make sure they're separated clean before you pick him up for a scratch. I'm gonna help you call the turns. Okay? Here we go. Release! Pit! Fight's on! I want him dead, boy! All right, 25-to-20, in this corner here. Come on, help yourself. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Easy money, boy. Take him, Brute! I'll give 25-to-20 on the little dog. Come on, yellow, stay up! Turn! Turn! Call it turn. Turn! I call a turn! Acknowledged. Help yourself. 25-to-20. Come on. Take 20. I'm covering all bets here. Twenty more, twenty more on him. Twenty-five. Clean the dog. Okay, mouth, back, balls! Thirty seconds! Check his throat! Get the hair out. All right. We're on. We're on. Time! Pit! He's coming. Turn him loose. Turn him loose. He curred out! We won. Damn him! Here, wrap him up. All right, boys, time to pay the rent. Let's see that mean green. Here we go. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes till the next fight. Sweet Lord, that was nice! Never seen a dog break a wall board. Just make sure he didn't break nothing else. Hell, he hardly broke a sweat. Yeah, you got yourself a tussler here, a real stud dog. Well, we can't stand him at stud till he takes the champion. Old Coal here's only interested in the quick money. Isn't that right, Coal? Too quick? That's a lot more than 250. Side bets, Coal, side bets. That's where the real money is. You're on your way, son. What the hell was that? That's what the losing dog gets. - To the lounge, Walker. - Got you, JL. Would you like another round? - Are you trying to get me drunk? - Damn right! Time to go. - I'm having a drink, Walker. - Yeah, we're having a drink. - Wanna lose your teeth this time, Stew? - Easy, buddy. You wanna tell me what's going on? It's my business. Mine alone. Oh, my God! Let me down. God damn it! Don't you ever touch me like that! Who the hell are you to touch me like that? You got everybody else touching you. - Hey, Walker! - Get inside! - You don't step out on me! - I wasn't! Hush, Brute! You don't step out on me! There are other banks and better towns, Walker. I don't need to share my bed with someone who's half in it. I've wasted enough of my life worrying about men. Tell me what you were doing. I was in Kentucky. This is for my girls. Are you sure he's okay? He's fine. We looked him over. No, I mean in here, with us. He's still Brute. Would you let your girls around him? If you're afraid he's gonna turn on you, he's completely loyal. Come on, give me your hand. He should sleep in the living room. Maybe you should, too. You have to know what you're doing with Brute is wrong. People don't do this. How would you know? You'd be surprised what people will do when they can't run away. Brute will never hurt you, and neither will I. Daddy, Daddy! Daddy, Daddy! Over here! Over here! Who's that? Who? Oh, that's my dog, Brute. - No. Her. - What? Her? That is my friend, Audrey. What's the big secret? She's the hussy that works at the bank. Excuse me, young lady. I think someone knows better than to talk like that, no? Audrey's a very nice person, and that's why I brought her here. 'Cause I... Well, I wanted her to see you two. Is she your girlfriend? Well, she's my good friend. - Do you kiss her? - What? All out of kisses now. Does Mom know? We got to go before we get caught. Bye. Hey! Love you. Don't need a speech. I ain't giving you one. - Well, he's good at it. - Too good, judging by the grapevine. - I didn't know he had it in him. - It was bred into him. And you shouldn't have brought it out. Easy looking from the outside, ain't it? This man is hustling you, son. The man doesn't care about you. He doesn't care about your dog. I'm gonna get the 5,000 and then that's it. He doesn't care about anything. And the dog is gonna lose his humanity, and you are gonna have to put him down. You never had kids, Chester. So don't fucking tell me how to do right by mine, okay? You stick with your goddamn strays. I'm done picking up strays! Cost too much. Hey. It's Wednesday. Marlene decided she had a headache this morning. Wait. No, please. What with the sitter, I'm barely gonna break even today. I need the tips, even yours. Hey, you don't need that. Nick, two eggs scrambled, biscuit and gravy, coffee, black. She too busy to cook you breakfast? Never trust a woman that doesn't cook. What else won't she do for you? I cook breakfast for her. Excuse us. - You're a real piece of shit, Walker. - Lou Ann, get back here. How dare you parade that whore - in front of the whole school! - I'm not parading anybody. Showing her to my girls! Both. We made them! And you keep forgetting that they're my girls, too! Not until you pay me, they ain't. Now, you steer clear, and you keep that whore away from my girls! Audrey. Her name is Audrey. You don't actually care about this one, do you? Fuck you. Come on, Brute. Come on, boy! Get that motherfucker! Two hours and they're both still game. Sea of green, Coal. Sea of green. Who's in now? Who's in? Come on. - Come on! - Come on, come on. Anybody else? Get him, boy, get him. Yeah! Yeah! - 80. - 85! Turn! They got her! All right, last chance. Get your money down here. Last chance. Get your money down. Get that water in him. All he can take. - I think he's going into shock! - Not with my money on him, he ain't! Pit! Stay down, stay down! Get him on the concrete, Curt! Get him! Come on! - You're the winner! - Yeah! Hey, hey, hey. Okay, okay. He needs an IV. Get Doc! I got to settle up these bets. I'll get Doc to meet you out back. Keep that dog warm. Doc! Vein's collapsed. I can't get it. Just fucking find one! Keep a level head, Coal. Police! Police! The police are coming! Leave the dog. Hey! Hey! - Get the dog in the car now. - This is an Italian shirt. Bring the money. - Got it, got it. Shit, he's gone cold. We got to go under the skin and hope it takes. I'm pulling over. Look, you do that, they kill him, we all go to jail. I got family across the river in Ohio. If you get us over there, he might make it. - I don't know my way! - You're the one who wanted to drive. Come on, stay awake. Stay awake. Turn left. Left. Turn! Just relax. It's all part of the game. Don't say a fucking word, Syrus, not one. - Might as well hold back, Coal. - You would've left him half dying. Coffee's coming up shortly. Keep it quiet down here, will you? - Thank you, ma'am. - Thanks, Anita. Come on with that, half-dying. It's just a little shock, is all. All he needs is some tender loving care. Hell, I heard about a man who took his pit bull to town, skin him alive. Bulldog's indestructible. Okay. It's okay, buddy. That's it. It's over now. It's over now. Come on, don't get him worked up. Just let him rest. He's gonna be all right. Whiskey? Game takes a steel spine, Coal. You'll get used to it. Did you ever care about another living thing didn't have a price on its back, Syrus? God damn, you are money hungry. Only kind of hungry to be. I'm helping you get your girls back, isn't that what I'm doing? Hmm? This little town's too small for secrets, you know. Now, you came to me about this. I didn't twist your arm or nothing. But I do take care of my partners. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. $2,000, right there. 2,000. It's chicken feed. There's big money down the road. And your dog's getting a reputation. Now all we got to do is challenge a champion. Big money. You think about it. And you just rest up. We'll get your dog fixed up. You just think about it, all right? Jesus, Walker. How can you do this? I made a promise to my girls, to myself. I can move away, start my own business, buy a real house, with a backyard and a swing set. I got to keep that promise, or I'm nothing. Nothing. Roy used to say, "I can't help myself," afterwards, crying on my shoulder. He got kicked around at work so badly that once or twice a week he'd have to kick me around. He couldn't help himself. My mother said that a woman shouldn't leave her husband for a few smacks, not a broken arm, either. I phoned her from the hospital to ask if a woman could leave her husband if he beat her so badly, she couldn't have babies. I know you love your girls, but you can't hurt someone and pass it off as necessity. These are just bruises and scratches. This is his nature. Sarah and Beth, they deserve a better life, and I'd like you to be a part of that life. If you want to. I'm not sure I do. Hey, when I see a baby-faced kid with English like that, I see an opportunity. This is the number at the bank. You give me a call, all right? Coal. I'm out, Syrus. You're out? Now, come on, sit down. Keith, can we get a couple of beers? Here, sit down. I'm not fighting Brute again. Well, that's a shame, Coal, 'cause I got what you wanted. I got you a date with the grand champion. I'll get the money another way. You came to me 'cause you didn't have another way. Now, look here. Championship match is gonna get your girls back. Then you put that little dog out at the stud, make all kinds of money. You know, you wouldn't understand, but I got people I got to look in the eye after this. Brute's not fighting. My experience is, when they're looking you in the eye, they're thinking about your pocket. Now me, I'd rather wear these gator boots and eat that vichyssoise. But maybe you don't have the stomach for it. That's all right, but the shame of it is, that little dog probably would have won. You're good. Good luck with your next yard sale. - Please. - I'm sorry, I got nothing. I can do anything. I used to run one of these things. Couple of hours early, aren't you? I need to empty my savings account. Okay. Well, I can do it better, that's all I'm saying. Whole damn town's out of work. What do you want? We need to talk. - Tell Nick I'll be in after my smoke. - Sure. Better be worth the gossip. You missed a button. That's how I like it. $3,400. Sending his girlfriend to do his dirty work? He doesn't know. - It ain't enough. - It's enough to get away, Lou Ann. I'll sign a bank note. We'll send you the rest. Let Walker have the girls. My kids are none of your damn business. They're Walker's business. I ain't a bad mother. I didn't say that. I know how much you need to get out of here. It's enough money. Let him go. If happiness is gonna cost me 5 grand, why should it cost Walker any less? Hmm? What you want? Must not be working for tips around here, huh? I was thinking after dinner, maybe we could go and... Door was open. You don't bring this here. You don't bring this in here. I've been thinking about our arrangement. There's a problem. I don't think you've been struggling enough. I need more money. $7,500. You are out of your fucking mind. I earned it. $7,500 in three weeks, or I'll leave the girls with my sister. Three weeks. You'll never leave my kids with that fucking drunk worthless piece of shit! Then I will dump them somewhere, and I swear to God, you will never find them! What happened to you? - What happened to you, Lou? - You, Walker, you. Keep an eye on this one, Walker. She's keeping secrets. Lou Ann came because of me. I took your money out of the lamp and put some of my own in. I thought she'd listen. I thought... This doesn't concern you. Doesn't concern me? You moved into my house, my bed, told me you wanted to be with me, and this doesn't concern me? Do you want me in or out, Walker? I have to know. What do you want? Talk to me. Talk to me. I got no choice. Better banks, better towns for you. You can go. And I'm never gonna make it to Paris for that happily ever after. I need 4,900. - 4,900! - I made you money. We made you money. My Cadillac isn't worth 4,900. - I mean, come on! - What about studding fees? You said we could stud this dog. Fine, we'll stud it. You take it all. Your dog's had two fights, no championship. What kind of stud fee are you gonna ask, huh? What's the dog worth? What's he worth? You tell me. No, you tell me. He's not worth diddly, unless you fight him. He's a fighting dog. I need to know this is the end, this championship is the end of this. Purse money alone's gonna get your girls back, - I mean, if we can get the fight. - If? Well, you backed out of it. I'm gonna have to pull some strings now, gonna take some time, and if you back out of it again... I don't know! Shit. Set up the fight. All right. You get the dog fit, and you meet me in three weeks at the Terre Haute airfield. If we're lucky, we'll get the fight. But you best be there, buddy. How goes it, Walker? Can't complain. Brute's looking tough. Come here, boy. Okay, boys, open it up. That's the challenger. - So you made it? Got a tan, I see. Yep. Had to go down to Tallahassee, unexpectedly. We still in on this? Sea of green, Coal, sea of green. Got to show the crowd the dogs before you wash them. You bet. Seen the dog we're fighting? Nothing to worry about. He's looking good. There's your corner, over there. I got to go find Doc. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna give you a peek at the dogs fighting in our championship later tonight. First up, out of Illinois, the challenger, Walker Payne and Brute. And, in his fourth title defense, straight out of hell, the grand champion! Hey, you got to be fucking kidding me. You can't fight those dogs. That dog must be 60 pounds. 60 pounds, that's disqualification, not even in weight. Buddy, did you see that crowd out there? Nobody's getting disqualified. Pit or you lose your stake. - Brute will never get another fight. - Fine. Fuck you. You and your dog aren't going anywhere. Too much at play here. Only way that dog is getting out of here is through that pit. Need to wash the other dog. You wash him. Few fights before yours. You better settle. - Come on, get him! - Get him! Get him! Get him! Kill him. Pit! Come on. Come on, get up, dog. Come on! Get him! Now, boy! - Come on. Brute! - Get him, get him! Come on, Brute! - Turn! - Acknowledge. Come on, kill him! Kill him! Come on! Give me a few more minutes. Give me a few more minutes. Come on. We're going home. We're going home. Time! Pit! That's it. It's over. I'm taking him... Just bury him. Never see a fight like that again, Coal. Goddamn spectacle. That was a once-in-a-lifetime deal. I got it all. Help me. Help me. Only thing that'll help that dog is a bullet. Hey! Side bets, Coal, side bets. Still don't get it, do you? What is the matter with you? Oh, I get it. I get it. It was a perfect bet, Coal, a perfect bet. No dog in the country was gonna go up against mine. They all heard the story. When I saw that little dog of yours, first time I saw that little dog of yours, I knew what you had on the other end of that leash. I put everything I had on him. Every dime! Every dime! Now you got what you wanted, I got mine. Well, let's just leave it like that and go on about our business. St. Louis? Two weeks. Mike's Pool Hall. Baby face. You gonna do it, or should I? Step out! Step out of the truck! Damn it, Walker, what are you trying to pull? JL. - Brute's hurt bad. - What? We got to get to Chester's. Chester will help. We'll use your car. We'll get to... The dog's dead, Walker. Get out of the car for me, Walker. Come on now, let's get up. Get a hold of yourself. Let's go. I'm gonna have to take you in. Girls! Girls, get in your room. - Who are you? - You Lou Ann? Syrus sent me here. That's for you, sweetheart. Everything worked out fine. Girls, get dressed. We are going out for breakfast. Time to go, Walker. I swear to God, I'm gonna drown Nick in the fryer. You girls can have anything you want for dessert. - Can we have ice cream? - Anything, sweetie. Two sundaes, Marlene. Have you seen Walker? Sure haven't. Thanks. Mom, it's Audrey. - It's not polite to point, Sarah. - Okay. Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Sure you don't want something? - No, I'm fine. Girls, don't move from this table, okay? Yeah. Hi. Think you could watch the girls for a while? I was thinking about getting my hair done. Yeah. Hey, Mama's gonna go take care of something. Audrey's gonna keep an eye on you. - Okay? - Mmm-hmm. You behave. Don't make a mess, okay? Okay? We're gonna have a tough time making bail. I'm pleading guilty. How long? I'm not sure. Well, however long, ain't long enough. You got to get out of here. Now, you get in your car, and you... You drive away, and you don't look back. Lou Ann's gone. Daddy! Daddy. Are you okay? I need a hug. When are you gonna get out, Daddy? Are we gonna have the house with the swing set and the swimming pool? No, we're never gonna have that. But we're gonna be together. Okay? I want you to go now. You have to go now. They can stay with me, till you get out. Once you get back on your feet, you're on your own. Please don't bring them here again.
