I was a little buzzed. The car in front of me ran this red light. I couldn't stop in time, and I hit him. The driver got thrown from the car. - You weren't hurt at all? - Just a little cut on my knee. The other driver wasn't hurt either, But he reeked of booze. - He was drunk too? - It was his third offense for drunk driving. - Oh. - He hit three cars in town Before he ran that light. - You stopped that guy from killing someone. You deserve... You deserve a medal rather than being here. - That's right. The system is messed up. It's not fair. - Well, two d. U.I.S don't make a right. She did break the law. - Screw that. I would've hired a lawyer. Sued him for a million. - A million? I would've got 12 million. - My lawyer said it was better to just plead guilty Than to fight it. - And you thought that was unfair. - He ran the light. I was just a little buzzed. Nobody could've stopped in time. I shouldn't be here. - No one thinks they should be here. - Hey, Im glad you're all here. We all have things we keep inside, Stuff we don't want to share.

(Cloth rips) - Thank you. - (Yells) (Gibbering with fright) (Knocking on door) Door... Open the door! - It's Meeks. - Let me in! - Crazy old guy? - If he's here, then maybe the devil is gone. - Get him in. There's a maniac out there. - Let me in! Oh. What the hell did you do? - We didn't do anything. - I'm gonna tell you something. Now, you young uns's been messing with something You ought not have. Now, this... You brought this on yourself! Now, I warned you. Now, what the hell did you do? He's mad as hell. I ain't never seen him so riled up. - Wait a second. We found this. - Oh. This is bad. Now, this is very, very, very bad. - So tell us what we're up against. - Well... (Sighs) I guess you heard all that nonsense about him, Dragging his ax and making the grand canyon And his footprints making the great lakes. - Paul Bunyan. You're telling us that's Paul Bunyan out there. - Back in late 1800s, There was a gentleman by the name Of captain larch Bunyan. Now, he was a lumber baron in these parts. He married this woman, Helga. She's new in town And ain't nobody knew from where. Well, Helga, she was ripe with child. Well, she gave birth To this big, giant bodacious baby. The doctor said, "Well, this child has a rare disease Or a rare blessing depending on how you look at it. "Now, he's gonna be at least twice as big "As a normal man "And gonna live three times as long, But he's always gonna have the mind of a child. " Of a child. Well, by the time he was five years old, He was six-Foot-Tall, still growing. Now, young Bunyan was working the lumberyards here In this area. He was... He was bringing down them big old oak trees With just three whacks of that ax. Of course all the competition and everything With the lumberjacks, you know, He won it all at the festivals and the fairs and whatnot, You know, hands down. Well, You see, them lumberjacks had cut down so many trees That the food was getting scarce. Animals were running off to the high country. Now, at this particular camp, this foreman bill and his men Were out hunting for a meal. Well, snow come early that year, And death was in the air. Now, the men were following the tracks Of this wounded animal through the snow, And that's when they came upon Bunyans beloved friend, Babe the blue ox. Now, babe had wandered off and stepped himself In a big bear trap. He was maimed, and he was weak, And he couldn't find his way home. But the loggers, they found him. - There he is, Up behind that bush. - What's he doing way up here? - He's lost. - No, he's dinner. (Babe roars) (Roars) - Oh, shit! (Guns cock) - Back off. I got him. (Gunshot) (Babe roars) - Foreman bill shot babe right between the eyes, Killed him deader than a dinosaur. - Elmer, fire up the grill. We're eating big tonight, buddy. - Right, boss. (Indistinct chatter) - Bunyan, he went out looking for babe, And he found him. And of course, he was too late. - (Growls) - The loggers had roasted up babe's carcass, And they were feasting on him like he was a Christmas dinner. - (Growling) No. - So when Bunyan saw what they did to his best friend... Well, the only friend he'd ever had in whole world... Well, he just went berserk. He just got that ax and just sliced them, Every damn one of them lumberjacks. - (Screams) - He killed 10 if he killed 40. Whack! Whack! Whack! - (Screams) - Whack! Whack! - (Screams) - Whack! - Die! - Whack! Whack! - No! - Whack! Why, he just made them kindling. - (Screams) - Foreman bill, Oh, he got the worst of it. Cut him such small pieces that the coyotes had a hard time Trying to find something to carry away. When Bunyan came to his senses, He went and hid until the snow melted, And then he ran and he ran. But the town-Folk, they hunted him down, Then caught up with him, And they chained him up, And they dragged him through the town, Back through the streets for everybody to see. The town-Folks, they spit on him. He was humiliated, embarrassed, red-Faced. Even Maybelle, who Bunyan was sweet on, She... She turned away. - (Growling) - They dragged him through the forest... - (screaming) - Tossed Bunyan in an old mine shaft Loaded with dynamite. One of them lumberjacks lit a match. (Imitates fuse lighting) Ka-Boom! (Explosions) Sealed that mine shaft forever. Well, then they made up nonsense about... (chuckles) Paul Bunyan, the lumberjack, You know, so they can keep the prosperity going. You know? Well, memories fade. People die. People forget. And you don't know when or who or what happened back then. (Chuckling) I do. I always knew. That old mine shaft, it couldn't hold him. No, no, no, he escaped. Bunyan, he escaped. He made his way up into the mountains, Up into the high country, And he took babe's sacred remains with him. And at the top of that mountain, He made a shrine to his only true friend. Bunyan lived there undisturbed, And he grew and he grew bigger, bigger, Alone, keeping to himself, Keeping away from civilization. He had a pretty good life up there, That is, until you went and fouled babe's grave site. You desecrated the resting place Of Bunyans only friend. - So we're stuck here. - Hey, ain't nobody going no place Until you all put babe's horn back where it belongs. - We're not going back out there. He'll kill us. - It's the only chance y'all got. (Dramatic music)  - No, Zack! No, Zack, come back! - Here! Take it back! This is what you want! I'm the one who took it! Take it back! And leave them alone! - Zack, get in here now! - No, Zack! No, no! (Cries) - (Gargling) - (Crying) - Come on. - No! - Get back. - No! - (Growling) (Gunshots) - No, please, Im sorry. No, no, no, no. (Screaming) - (Crying) no, no, no. - What are you doing? - I'm making something to eat. - I just lost another kid. - Yeah, well, Im sorry for your loss. That boy maybe just saved all our hides. Well, got his horn back. Let him settle. We get out of here first light. (Mumbling) - Tell my daughter I love her. - Don't say that. - I promised her I was gonna pick her up And get her from that place And I was never gonna leave her again. (Crying) I promised her. Marty. - You're gonna be okay. - Yeah. - You're gonna be okay. - Yeah. - Here. Like this. Guess that's the benefit of your dad being the sheriff. You learn things. I never told my dad I loved him Before he dropped me off. - He knows, And you're gonna get a chance to tell him. - Are we gonna make it out of here? - Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. - (Breathing hoarsely) (Laughs) - Sheriff Tanner, come in. - Yeah, go ahead, Debbie. - We have another bear sighting. Hiker saw it a couple days ago. Sheriff, can you swing on up to cutter's peak? - Yeah, actually, Im in the area. I'll go check it out. - In the area? What are you doing way up there, sheriff? - I'm on a sightseeing trip. - Sightseeing? - Hey, listen, Ill be back later today. I'll go check it out. Tanner out. - There was a reason why Bunyan saved you And split some of your friends like two halves of a peach. You know who you are? You're the spitting image of the little lady That broke Bunyans heart. (Paper rustling) My great-Aunt Maybelle. You know what they would do to him If they found him out there. You know. (Whispering) you got a second chance. You got a second chance. Don't you let him down. - It's time. - I'll get the truck. Stay right here. - Maybe we should go with you. - No, no, no. You stay here.
