You never can tell what they'll settle for until you've tried it! Hey! Three root beers. It doesn't look like much now, Mike, but we'll have a hell of a crowd. We will? People come into this town on the weekends from 25 miles around. I checked all that out. You the fellows they're putting up the stands for? That's right. Harry told me you were coming. Who's Harry? Fellow putting up the stands. Never seen nothing like that around here before. No' sir. It's going to be something. - Browdy? - Yeah? What about the highway? What about it? It's too close to the field. Who's going to pay $2.50 for a ticket... ...when they can park along the highway and watch for nothing? Anybody who'd pull a cheap trick like that' I don't want to think about. - What do I owe you? - Forty-five cents. - You really charging $2.50? - You're damn right we are. And it's worth every penny of it! Still and all, it seems to me the young fellow has a point. Kind of foolish for someone to pay $2.50 to see it, if he could... ...just park his car right along here and watch. Do me a favor, will you? Don't spread that idea around. Hell, no! Business. I know that. Besides, I happen to own the land for 150 yards both ways along here. Anybody wants to park tomorrow and watch, it'll cost them $1! That pilot should be along soon. We ought to get moving. - You ever done this before? - No, you tell me what to do. How's your altimeter? - Altimeter? - Yeah. - Fine. - Are you sure? Sure I'm sure. Why? It'd help tomorrow if we knew how far we are from the ground. I've seen some altimeters you wouldn't believe. Mine you can believe. You have an honest face. I was born in this town. Is that a fact? You don't seem very excited about it. I haven't been here in a long time. I left when I was a kid. That's the best time to leave. I might even have some family here. I thought you didn't have any family. Not really family. An aunt and uncle. It's a long story. I know you don't like long stories so I won't tell it. Thank you. Hell! I wouldn't even know what to say to them if they were still here. Start by saying hello. See how it goes from there. - Wind's out south. Hope it stays that way. - Why? From the north we'll have to come in over those phone wires... ...to get close to that grandstand. We had a guy working with us, hit the wires. He get hurt? Killed him, as a matter of fact. How would you feel about a home-cooked meal for a change? I can hardly wait. Cynical bastard. We don't even know these people. They're not going to adopt us. They want to put us up for a night. Will you do it here, Mike? I think this might be a good spot for it. You think? Who does it, you or Rettig? Look, kid, this is a business. They don't pay to watch us walk across the street. When are you going to get that through your head? If you're so concerned about Rettig doing the cape jump, you can learn it. Then you wouldn't have to worry about him. I have a better idea. Why don't you do it? Because I recognize my limitations. It's the secret to my success in life. Littering the public thoroughfare. $50 or 10 days. Take your choice. That's a choice? I suppose we could make up a case for flying that plane... ...at a dangerously low altitude but I haven't the faintest idea... ...of what the statute is on that. And if we lived here we'd be home now. It's Malcolm. Malcolm? Well, Malcolm, look at you! Look at you! What about your friends? Aren't they coming in? They're a little shy. Browdy? Mike? Looks pretty nice. Sure is a hot one today, isn't it? Yes, isn't it? - Nice little town you have here. - Yes. Malcolm tells us that you have a nice little college here too. We have a college. We have a college and a missile base. Typical little American town. - You connected with the college? - No. I almost went to college once. Really? Yeah. Why didn't you? You said you almost went to college. Yeah. It didn't work out. Gentlemen. Sit down. We really appreciate this, Mrs. Brandon. We're delighted to have you. We've plenty of room. More than we can use. We take in boarders all the time. You make it sound as though we had a "Rooms To Let" sign on the lawn. What my wife means is that... ...we make a room available each year for a student from the college. To be precise. Where is Annie, by the way? At the library. It's only lemonade, gentlemen... ...but if you'd care for something stronger... No, Mrs. Brandon. I haven't had lemonade for years. Of course, the kid here, he never touches anything stronger. - Isn't that right, kid? - Hardly ever. Of course, Rettig will drink anything. My! It's stuffy in here, don't you think? With the windows closed the house cools off. No use letting all the warm air in now, is there? I'd rather have the warm air than no air at all' but... Malcolm. It's hard to believe. It's been such a long time. I think Malcolm was about 10 years old when we last saw him. He said it'd been a pretty long time. The summer you fell out the upstairs' window. He didn't happen to fall on his head, did he? That would explain a few things. We've seen Malcolm since then... ...at the funeral the following year, wasn't it? Yes, of course. That was the following year. You bear a marked resemblance to your father, Malcolm. Doesn't he? Yes, you do. How long are you thinking of staying? Just through tomorrow night. We have to leave first thing Monday. But Monday is the Fourth! We have a wonderful parade and a fireworks display. You should at least stay for that. Thank you, Mrs. Brandon, but we really have to be shoving off. Do you expect a good crowd tomorrow? We expect to pick up a nice piece of change tomorrow. Pays well, this sort of thing? If we make it interesting enough. How do you do that? Make it interesting? I shouldn't think you'd have to do anything in particular... ...to make it more interesting than it is to begin with. What Browdy means is the closer we come to the ground... ...the more interesting it is for the customers. And for us too, of course. How terrifying. Elizabeth, it's 3:30. You'll be late for your meeting. Yes, so it is. You'll have to excuse me. I'm the chairman. I have to be there. Why don't you take one of them along with you? You could tell the ladies all about your exciting show. I expect you'd sell quite a few tickets. I like it. Mrs. Brandon, would the ladies be interested? - I'm sure they'd be fascinated. - Why don't I go along with Mrs. Brandon? You? While you put the posters out around town. - The posters would only... - Am I dressed all right? No, you're fine. I'll get the car. It really does sound very exciting. - You said it was terrifying. - Yes. I suppose in a way that's what makes it exciting, isn't it? Most ordinary people can't help but respond... ...to the idea of some excitement in their lives, you know. Even if it terrifies them? Yes, exactly. - Do you remember them very well? - No. No, I don't. Your mother was a beautiful woman. - A wonderful woman. - Malcolm? Hey, kid? It's clouding up. I don't want those chutes left out. - What should we do with them? - You can put the trailer in the garage. Thanks, Mr. Brandon. That'd be fine if you don't mind. The radio did say rain. They're wrong nine times out of ten. I'll get an accurate report out at the field. Actually, the forecast was for showers in the morning. See? Showers in the morning. It couldn't hurt us. Customers will come. Browdy? Forget about the customers. If the chutes get damp, we don't jump. The chutes will be in the garage, so they won't get damp. Stop worrying. Browdy? The garage, dry! Besides, like Rettig says, we have to make it interesting for ourselves. Now there are several places you can wear a chute: On your back. On your chest. Or you can sit on it. Now, ladies, this particular parachute... ...this one I'm wearing, is called a Para-Commander. It's a sophisticated chute and quite heavy, as you can see. It takes quite a bit of practice to get used to. In fact, it takes between 25 and sometimes 50 jumps... ...with a training chute, before you can handle this baby. I mention it in case some of you ladies thought you might like to try it once. This device here is your ripcord handle. This, when pulled sharply, opens your pack. Now watch this. Sorry. This is your pilot chute. This is what pulls your canopy completely out of the pack. Like this. These are your suspension lines. You can see they extend some 25 feet from the harness there to the canopy. When the canopy pops open, you're traveling down toward the earth... ...at a speed of 125 to 200 miles per hour, depending on the angle of the body. Yes, ma'am? What is a canopy? This, ma'am. This is a canopy. Not to be confused with some of the canaps you ladies... ...might have with a martini before dinner. No. All right, let's try it again from "B." And clarinets... ...could we hear you? Some verve. Con brio. Pep. All right, are we ready? From "B." Hi. You're Malcolm. I'm Annie Burke. They told me you were coming. - I didn't mean to interrupt... - That's all right. You play very well. Thank you, but you're either very kind... ...or you know nothing at all about playing the piano. No, I don't know very much about it. But I do know when it sounds good. - You live here? - I rent a room. You go to the college? In the summer? I failed a course last semester. I'm making it up. They told me what you do. Sounds ridiculous. I suppose it does. Why did you do this? Do what? Come here? To sell some tickets. I didn't want to turn down your husband's invitation. Your friend could have come. Mr. Browdy. Your husband didn't invite Mr. Browdy. You have contempt for us, don't you? Who? Certainly everybody here this afternoon. Maybe everyone else too. Certainly us. Why are we contemptible to you? Do you care? No, as a matter of fact' I haven't been back since I left... ...about 12 years ago now. I was a kid. - Where does your family live now? - They're dead. That's why I left. They were killed in a car accident. I guess my father was drunk. I didn't know that at the time, of course... ...later I figured that's what it must have been. He was a pretty reckless character, I guess. They put me in this home. I was adopted out a couple of times, and... Why didn't they ever take you? The Brandons? I never asked. It beats motels. Listen, what was that this afternoon? What was that all about? What was what all about? I can't quite see you making speeches to ladies' clubs. I try, but I can't quite picture it. You should have been there. I was a big hit. I don't doubt that. What's on your mind, kid? Appleton. - Forget it. - Do you? I don't think about it one way or the other. You almost went into the ground. The same thing at Lawrenceville. How can you not think about that? I said, "Forget it." Remember what you always said when I first started with you? "Be careful." That's what you always said. "That's what is important in this business. Be careful." Is that what I always said? Why are you taking so many chances now? What are you trying to prove? We'll be jumping from a Howard DGA-15. DGA, that stands for Damn Good Airplane' which, of course, it is. Very tricky to land, though. You're better off jumping out of it than you are trying to land it. This one is in good shape. To Browdy, an airplane is in good shape if it has wings and a prop. We've had a lot worse. You remember that time in Adler? We had an airplane in Adler that never even got off the ground. Hit the end of the runway' went into a cornfield... ...harvested about an acre of corn before the pilot could get it stopped. Will you watch us jump tomorrow? We'll be there, won't we? Yes, I'm looking forward to it. What is the most dangerous stunt that you do? The cape stunt. That's a stunt we do with a cape. - Do you do that one? - Oh, no. Rettig does that one. I don't understand why you do this thing at all. To me it's a business. Mr. Rettig, what is it to you if you don't mind my asking? I had a friend in the Army. A sergeant. A parachutist for about 20 years. He used to say that jumping was not only a way to live... ... but also a way to die. Damned few things are. That's very interesting. "He is at liberty to die, who does not wish to live." - Do you believe that? - That's dead wrong. Are you a religious man, Mr. Browdy? What's religion have to do with it? - Browdy goes to church every Sunday. - Okay, kid. - Does that embarrass you, Mr. Browdy? - No, it doesn't. Why should it? If we're going to go downtown we'd better get started. - If you'll excuse us, Mr. Brandon? - I think that's a good idea. Anybody know a good place? We're open for suggestions. The Horse's Head is nice. The Horse's Head is on the quaint side, don't you think, Annie? The Paradise might be the place that would appeal to you. What sort of place would appeal to us? I just meant that it was lively. I intended no offense. Would you care to come along, or do you have other plans? Thank you. I have a date. Well, that's the breaks, kid. Rettig, are you coming? Mrs. Brandon, very nice supper. You're welcome. Is that yours? You wish! What's it for? Money for the jukebox. That doesn't look like small-town stuff to me. Nothing looks like small-town stuff to you. So what's wrong with that? All right. Okay, what can I do for you, boys? Yeah, right. Besides that? Why don't we start with three beers? And from there, we'll see what develops. Right. What do you think, Mike? I think definitely. One of these days you'll be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. I was wrong once. About 1953, I think, wasn't it? What do you make of these people, Mike? - What people? - The Brandons. I don't know. What should I make of them? Kind of peculiar, don't you think? No offense, kid. It's nothing to me... ... they're as much strangers to me as they are to you. I must say, the three of you don't act like a family. I'll tell you one thing: She is one good-looking woman. Class. It was so quiet, I wondered where you were. I'm here. Sit down and take a load off. Hey. You going to come out tomorrow and watch us jump? Jump what? Here. Be our guest. Oh, you're them! Yeah, we're them. Where is your airplane? It's parked outside. Here, bring a friend. - My boyfriend, maybe? - Think he can get along with Mike? Well, if he didn't' I could. No. - He's married and got seven kids. - Yeah, sure. I'll bet. What is your name? Mary. You're kidding? No. And if you say anything about my being contrary... ... or how my garden grows, I scream. I love her, I really do. Will you marry me? - Tuesday. I'm tied up till then. - Okay. - See you later. - Where are you going? For a walk. I'm taking off too. That music is giving me a headache. You leaving old Browdy to his own devices? Tomorrow is Sunday. You think you'll be able to find a church? Get lost, will you? Smell it? Look, if it rains, we don't jump. That's simple enough, isn't it? It's simple enough. - You want some company? - No. You don't mind, do you, kid? Rettig? Maybe you'll forget the cape stunt tomorrow. Might not be a bad day for it, if the air is damp, heavier. A slower descent. By what, a couple of seconds? What does that matter? You can only stay up so long. Then you have to come down, right? That's right. Sometimes I think you hate to come back to the ground. Beautiful night. A little cooler. You're all back early. No, I'm alone. We're a little out of place here, aren't we? Browdy and I, anyway. Why, of course not. We're delighted to have you. You don't have to do that. Do what? Be polite and gracious. It's not necessary. You're very direct, aren't you? Not very subtle, you mean. No, I didn't say that. I think you are subtle, but in a direct sort of way. You want a drink or something? Are you married? No. Were you ever? Yes. What about Malcolm? What do you mean? He means a lot to you, doesn't he? He might have been ours. We might have raised him after his mother and father were killed. But you didn't. John didn't want him. Did you? Yes, I wanted him. Malcolm's mother was my sister. I was in love with Walt, Malcolm's father. It was sort of taken for granted that we would be married. I don't know, I guess I wasn't very observant. One day, Walt and Eleanor disappeared. When they came back a few days later, they were married. And after a while... ... after what might be called a suitable period of mourning... ... I married John. Then it was all right for a long time. I mean, we liked each other. We really did. And then there was the accident. Malcolm was left with no one and... ... John didn't want him. I couldn't blame him for that. He knew I wanted Malcolm because he was Walt's child. It was his right not to want him for the same reason. Why do you stay married to him? Why not? I imagine you're the sort of man who always manages to find the best... ... and rightest reasons for everything you do. Do you think that's possible for everyone? I'm always hopeful. Come in. What are you doing? I have a rip in this. It's part of my costume. Browdy likes for us to look neat. Would you like for me to do it for you? No thanks. I sew pretty good. No luck tonight? With what? Usually there are a lot of unattached girls at the Paradise. I guess I hit an off night. How was your date? Okay. Sit down. Taxi! Come here. Is everything all right, fellow? I'm new around town here, Officer. I just remembered my car is down the street. I once jumped out of this window. You what? As a kid, I wondered what it would be like to jump from this high up. I think I had it in the back of my mind that I could fly. Look all right? Yeah, that's pretty good. Good night. Good night. Thanks. Tell you what I'm going to do one of these days: One of these days, I'm cutting out. I'm going to go out to Hollywood. I'm going to get me a job as a stuntman. They make good dough. I know that for a fact. You asleep? Hey, you asleep? I'm not going to do this forever. I have plans. "Lord, I am not worthy... ... to have you come under my roof. Speak but the word, and my soul shall be healed." "Lord, I am not worthy... ... to have you come under my roof. Speak but the word, and my soul shall be healed." He knows, doesn't he? Does it happen often? Not often, but it happens. Are you surprised? Tomorrow, when we leave here... ... I want you to come with me. - Come with you? - Yes. Do you always offer more than you're asked for? Only to those who ask so much less than they want. But if it was what I want' do you think I could accept it? There's always another choice. Don't you see that? Not for everyone. For everyone! How do you come to have this wonderful freedom of choice? - You take it. - From whom? From anyone who says it isn't yours to take it. I envy you. Don't envy me. Join me. - Leave me alone! - Do it! The merciful stranger come to save me from the terrible boredom... ... and lovelessness of my life. Is that what you think you are? I'm only offering you a way out. I don't want a way out! Well, then, that's the difference. You have to want it. It's early. It could stop any time. Good stiff wind out there. Blow it away in a couple of hours. We got 650 tickets out of it. The business is my end, let me take care of it, will you? It's all yours, Browdy. Stop needling me for worrying about it then, okay? I don't notice you passing up your cut when it comes time to split the take. Sometimes I think you have a cash register for a head. All right, kid. You don't have to jump if you think it's too dangerous. - Rettig and I can make out ourselves. - What do you mean? Stop bugging me! Your chicken streak is showing. - My chicken streak? - Right. I've seen your hands sweating and shaking. Trying to talk yourself into just one more jump. And the next, and the next... Just a slight misunderstanding, Mrs. Brandon. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, kid. I'm a little bit on edge. We're all a little on edge. Your nose is bleeding, kid. Browdy? You ever see him sweat, kid? You ever see his hands shake up there? No, I never have, Browdy. Where's your crowd? They'll come. We're going to be all right. How are you? Good morning. How's our airplane? I tell you, she's gassed up, the seats torn out and the door's off. - That doorway is pretty narrow. - Three of you will get out at one time? We're used to it. Rettig can tell you what he wants. The main thing is, get back on the ground as soon as possible after every jump. A long wait is bad for the crowd. They get restless. - Got it. - Just don't get down before we do! If I do, I'll shorten your program considerably. - That's good. - All right. There's a guy out there setting up a PA system. Give him that and ask him to give us an outlet. - This is really exciting. - Yeah. I never did anything like this before. There are a couple of kids around, stir them up... ... and send them in to make a couple of bucks. That's not going to be hard. I'm ready. Are you certain that you won't come along? You're not coming, Mrs. Brandon? When we come down in the parachutes, we need some help. I want two of you to come out on each parachute... ... and you grab it and help us collapse it. Understand that? But the main thing is for you to get... ... as many parachutes out there in front of the stands. We want plenty of parachutes, right? Okay, you can start now. Listen, men. Don't lift any more than you can carry. - Mr. Browdy? - Yeah? I'm the ambulance service. - Well, where is it? - Out behind the hangar. Well, come on, let's get it out here so they can see it. I don't know what you mean? It's just part of the act, understand? We're not going to need it. Knock wood. We have to let them see it. Got it? I see what you mean. You drive that ambulance right in front of the stands nice and slow. And you get the light going, and let's make some noise. Understand? Park it right over there on the other side of the stands. You got it? All right, go! - You see that crowd? - Yeah. What's with Rettig? I don't know. Hell of a crowd, Browdy! Testing, one, two, three, four. Testing, one, two, three, four. That's okay, Eddie. Let's put on the record. - Any questions? - No, I think I got it. What's the matter? A little nervous. You're going to get over it real soon, aren't you? Yeah. Just don't worry about me. Don't worry about me. Are we all set? Say hello to Dick Donford. He's from the local radio station. Hi. I'll be doing the commentary on all the jumps. The stunts that I go up on. You just describe what you see and add a little color. Use your imagination. I've done a lot of sports events, like basketball games. Right, call it like a basketball game. Attention, please! Good afternoon' I don't see my aunt. You're not going to be disappointed, I can promise you that. We have some very fine stunts lined up for you. Which one is it? The one in white. I like the one in the red better. Yeah, so did I. We'll all leave the aircraft together. What the hell. The way things worked out, I got no complaints. Did I introduce ourselves? No, I didn't. In the yellow jump suit, a local boy making good, Malcolm Webson. Let's hear it for Malcolm. In the red jump suit,... a gentleman who'll do something special for you. Mr. Mike Rettig! Let's hear it for Mike. And me, my name is Browdy! Cut! Here he comes. There's his chute. Hey, watch it! What's happening? Looks like he lost something. I guess it's a joke. We have a little problem here. That jump suit that I lost is the only one that I have. We have people all over the countryside looking for it,... so I'll be right back with you as soon as we can find it. How do you feel? In the meantime, I thought I'd make myself useful around here... ... by going up with the guys and describing a jump from our viewpoint. It's kind of a change of pace. How does that sound to you? Are you ready, folks? Okay. Incidentally, there's a reward for that jump suit. Anybody finding it gets a free parachute jump. Off we go into the wild blue yonder. Climbing high into the sun. Hey, down there, can you hear me? If you can hear me, let's hear it. Come on, let's hear it. That's not loud enough! Come on, let's hear it. Hey, that's a lot better. It's a beautiful sight up here. I wish you were all up here with me! Mike and Malcolm are getting themselves set. You're going to like this stunt. It's one they've been working on for quite a while. I'm getting the go-ahead from Mike now. Okay! There they go! They're off! You should be able to see them about now. It looks good. It looks real good. Yeah, it looks real good! I'm falling out. I fell out of the plane! Is there a doctor in the house? I think I'm going to faint! I want to tell you how much I've enjoyed being a part of this show. I know that Mike Rettig and Malcolm are going to carry on without me. I'd like you to tell them for me! Will you? I don't want any of you to be upset. These are the chances we take, we all know it can happen at any time. Especially if you're stupid enough to fall out of a plane without a chute! But I'm not that stupid! So I guess I better open the chute... ... before this joke goes too far! Now we come to the most dangerous and exciting stunt. I'd like to be able to say we all drew lots to see... ... who'd perform this stunt, but that'd be a lie... ... because Malcolm and I are chicken. That leaves Mike Rettig. Seriously, as far as we know, Mike is the only person... ... in this country performing this stunt at the present time. Wearing this specially designed cape. Mike is going to jump... ... and do some very nice things for you on the way down. He'll be traveling in excess of 200 mph. Up to now, the fastest we've gone is about 100 mph. You can see the difference. Another thing: Unless he holds his arms correctly, the wind can break them off. Attached to each foot will be this smoke flare... ... so he'll leave a trail through the sky you can follow. Unless the flare malfunctions and burns his legs, which they have a habit of doing. Mike Rettig. Now, let's hear it for Mike. Come on, let's hear it! - See you, kid. - Rettig? Don't be late for supper! There's the aircraft. Cut! His flares are lit! Pull it! Pull it! Rettig! Get out of here! Get out! What's the matter, you morbid creeps! Come on, get out of here! Come on, get out of here! Move them back, damn it. What's wrong with you? Get out of here! Malcolm? Are you all right? It's all set for Tuesday, here in Bridgeville. Listen. Listen, I don't like to talk about this any more than you do, but... ... we've got to get some dough. For the burial and everything. Tomorrow is the Fourth. I thought maybe we can put on a short program... ... and call it a memorial jump. Something like that. Maybe only do one jump. I can get on television and radio tonight... ... and newspapers in the morning. Then tomorrow, we'll pass the hat. What do you think? Who'd come to see one jump? Unless... ... we jumped the cape. That's not necessary. We can lend you the money for the burial. Mrs. Brandon... That wouldn't be any good at all. You can understand that, can't you? Okay, I'll do it. Has he done this jump before? No. You want me to do it? Do what? The jump tomorrow. We didn't really talk about it. You just said you'd do it. I'll do it. It doesn't matter which one of us does it. So, I'll do it. I jumped the cape once, you know. I didn't know that. Once. A long time ago. Something weird about that stunt. Rettig isn't the first one to go into the ground doing that one. I almost did myself. That one time I jumped the cape. There were a couple of seconds when... ... I felt like the cape would actually keep me up. I had wings or something. It was crazy. I almost didn't pull the ripcord. I came really close. A lot of guys ride the cape right into the ground. You don't know if you're the kind... ... that might do that until you've ridden the cape once. At least once. All right, now. Once again, from the beginning. And remember, people, time is short. Time is very short. And that concludes the national news. Now, for the local scene. Come in. We've been asked to announce... ... that tomorrow's Fourth of July parade will start at city hall... ... and then proceed north on Main Street. Huge crowds are expected. So if you're traveling through the area... ... you're advised to use outlying alternate routes. We'll keep you advised. So for up-to-the-minute traffic bulletins, stay tuned to this station. And here's the weather report: The weatherman has promised temperatures in the high 90s. So dress accordingly. Now for the local baseball scores. I keep remembering myself standing at the airplane this afternoon. Standing there looking at him. Wanting to say something. Like there was some magic word. I couldn't say that word... ... because I don't know what it is. Pay attention, damn it! Cut! Okay, pull it! Come on, pull it! Rettig! Terrific. You were terrific! You scared the hell out of me. What did you wait so long to pull it for? It was beautiful, beautiful! When you pulled it, you really pulled it, didn't you? Right out of the pack. - Hey, kid, you ready? - Just about. - Is everything... - Everything is taken care of. Are you leaving too, Mr. Browdy? No, I'll be staying through tomorrow. But I see no point in my staying here tonight. I wouldn't feel right if the kid was gone and everything. I'll wait for you downstairs. You have about a half an hour before the train. Malcolm?
