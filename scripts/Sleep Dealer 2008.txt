We call the factories "sleep dealers", because if you work long enough, you collapse. But sometimes, I'd forget where I was. And everything came back to me. My home. The house where I grew up. In Santa Ana del Rio... Oaxaca, Mexico. My name is Memo Cruz. We need water. And Memo? Take a guess. Memo! Hacking ForBeginners Let's go, it's getting late. I was just on my way out. To me, Santa Ana was a trap. Dry, dusty, disconnected. But my father lived in his memories of it. He owned some land... even hired local guys to help him. The king of the town. But they say he changed... when they built the dam. Since when? This is nuts. Hey Pop, can I ask you... why are we still here? Well, let me ask you: Is our future a thing of the past? You think it's funny? Well, yeah. That's impossible. No. We had a future. You're standing on it. When they dammed up the river... they cut off our future. You weren't even born yet. You don't know how that felt. This might not look like much - but it's ours. And you want to let it dry up and disappear? Yeah. Exactly... You think you know everything. You don't even knowwho you are. At least I know the world is bigger than this milpa. Hey, you made it! Of course! Check it out - I got nodes. - Did it hurt? - Nah. Oh, come on... Well... at first it burns. Like having a hot nail driven into your arm. But I'm already working as a bus boy in New York... I mean, it looks like New York. It might also be Los Angeles. At first, all I could hear were voices from around the village. After a while, I started to pick up voices from further away... the big cities. Where people like me... were working in hi-tech factories. I went to the node doctor last week - and I already got a job! Tijuana has the fastest connections. Your DNA is your password! Tell everyone I'm doing great - and send a kiss to Paco. Of course, you can do it too! Anyone can connect. All you need to do is... What's u p? Hey. How are the guys? Good. Rico's such a drunk. He pissed on the electric fence. One of these days that talking gun will shoot you right in the ass. Bring it on. When are you gonna stop pretending you're somewhere else? To grow up in Santa Ana, you needed an escape. My brother was addicted to American hi-def. Right on! That summer in Santa Ana felt like any other. We're taking off. Give this to your crazy uncle. Buy some beers on the way back. Cold ones. You got it. See you soon. What's wrong? Don't like old time music? Hey, what you watching? Dude - that looks like Santa Ana. No way... That's your stupid radio... Pap... What did you do? I told her I'd go to the city... find work... help them any way I could. Nice to meet you... Name? Luz Martinez. - Occupation? - I'm a writer. Oh yeah? Need a writing partner, baby? Calm down, froggie! My name is Filiberto. Name? Want me to put your bag up? No thanks. - Sorry. - No problem. Excuse me. Where did you get them? My nodes? A long time ago... from a guy, a friend. My mom freaked out when she saw them. She's so old-fashioned - she thinks they're just for sex. Never seen them before? Only on TV. Where can I get some... without paying for a doctor? Well, you need somebody to connect you... a coyotek. If you go to the alley in front of "The Star"... you can ask around there. What's your name? Memo. I'm Luz. Are you coming from far away? A tiny village... Santa Ana del Rio. Tijuana - City of the Future Move it! Play messages. You have one new message. Ms. Martinez - This is the Institute for Bio-Media. Your student loans are in severe default. If you don't return our call, we'll enter your apartment... confiscate your belongings, and sell them.

THE STRUGGLE OVER A WELL Sales: 0 A WITCH DOCTOR Sales: 0 THE REBELS Sales: 2 New document. Title? A migrant from Santa Ana del Rio. Bio-thentication activated. Tijuana, Mexico. The biggest bordertown in the world. It pulls people in like a magnet. Even today, long after the border has been closed. Wandering souls keep coming... carrying nothing but their dreams. Today I met one. I didn't think much of him. Repeat the last ten seconds. Please tell the truth. At first, I didn't think much of him. He looked... like they all do. A little lost... holding on to whatever was left behind. Trying not to look scared. Coming to Tijuana, to work in the sleep dealers... he should be. Need a coyotek? Lookin' for a node job? I'll hook you up. Need a connection? Skinny dudes like you are my speciality. Know how to drive? I'll get you a cab in London. No? What about picking oranges in Florida? Bro... Don't want to hook up with those jokers, right? I wouldn't let them lube my connectors... much less give me a node job. Cool. I understand. I've been in your place. I remember what it was like... before I got nodes. I'll hook you up... fast... and dirt cheap. What do you say? You up for it? How much? Knowwhat? You remind me of my Uncle Tito. He crossed the border in the old days... by foot. No joke! Before nodes, that's how they used to do it. Unbelievable! Another thing about my uncle... he was a dumb ass. Just like you. Back at home, I'd heard people talking... So I knew that node workers lived far out, at the edge of the city. Excuse me. Do you know if anyone lives here? Does it look like it? Shut up, fool. Welcome. If no one's there, go for it. It's your house. Good morning. Good morning. There's been activity in your account. Display account. 28 clients found your story by searching "Santa Ana del Rio". You had one sale - and one message. I'm interested in the guy you met. Where he's from and why he left. Any background information would be helpful. I can pre-pay for the next memory. Holy sh it. I don't understand, "holy shit". Looki ng for a node job? It's a miracle. I found you. What are you doing here? Looking for you. For me? Why? I was thinking about you. How'd it go last night? Great. Some guy jumped me, stole all my money. Anyway, I'll find someone else. If you want, I can help. Want to connect, baby? Wait for me over there? The Tijuana Node Bar. In the bars you could find a cheap connection. You could find almost anything. They served shots of teki to exhausted node workers. He's busy - doing a node job. You're not from here, right? I'm from far away. I came here to work. What do you do? I'm a writer. Trying to be one at least. It's pretty new to me. But I love it... letting people out there see what I see. But my story's not that interesting. Why are you here? My family had some problems. We needed money. That's why I'm here. Our turn. Hey! What's up? Careful with the injector. It says 120, but it's running at 140. Good luck, kid. Have a seat. And the coyotek? You're looking at her. You? You want a node job, right? If I do it, it'll be done right. Where did you learn to do all this? My boyfriend was a coyotek. He installed my nodes so we could connect. He taught me. Your boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. The technology was more interesting than him. Take off your shirt. Give me your hand. You ticklish? A little. These nodes are the best you can get on the street. But there's still a risk. If there's a virus or a short circuit... electricity will pour into your body through the nodes. When you connect to the other side... your body hooks into a machine. It's a two-way connection. Sometimes you control the machine. And sometimes the machine controls you. Breathe in. It'll ease the pain. Finally... I could connect my nervous system... to the other system. The global economy. Near the place where I was living... on the outskirts of the city... stood the networked factories - the "sleep dealers". This is the American Dream. We give the United States what they've always wanted... all the work - without the workers. Jos is in a slaughterhouse in lowa. Maria is a nanny for a little girl in Washington. You three will be on a big job in San Diego. Hey kid - Plug in. Your future starts today. HOWTO CONNECT A NODE OXYGEN KEEPS YOU ALER THIS EQUIPMENT PAYS YOUR SALARY - TAKE CARE OF IT! Spanish. Yes. How's it going? I guess you made it. I got a job. I think it's in California. Look. Looks like you finally found a way to get out of here. What's that supposed to mean? You want me to feel worse than I already do? I'm just saying, it's what you always wanted. To get away from this place. Bro, I didn't call to fight with you. Congratulations! You sent money! You sent $270. Minus taxes, fees, and surcharges... they received $ 180! Dude, this is a lot of money. Mom won't believe it. Can you send more? Sorry I'm late. Don't worry, I just got here. Well, how did it go? I still don't know how to thank you. Photos? Take home a memory of this beautiful evening. No thanks. I think we should. I see who wears the pants here. C'mon, kid. That's it! So? You must've left two or three back home... Zero. Really? Most of the men I knowwant as many girlfriends as possible. I have a theory: They learn it from their fathers. Didn't yours teach you that? I don't feel like talking about my family right now. I understand. My folks think I'm nuts. Being here, trying to make it as a writer. Why? Girl's not married, living on her own, something must be wrong. Last night I conducted a follow-up interview, and... Please tell the truth. I'm trying to maintain my distance so that... Focus on simple, easy to remember details. The truth is... I didn't expect to feel anything. He told me... he eats every Sunday night in the central market. It reminds him of home. His eyes... This is stupid. End of transcription. Problems with the story? I wish it were a story. All I do is talk about my feelings. Well, that's how it works, right? You can't hide anything. Maybe that's the problem. I'm telling the truth to a machine - but lying to him. Wait - he doesn't know? Well, I'm sure he's happy to have someone to talk to. I feel like he needs someone. He told me his father died. This is one of my favorite places. Want to go for a swim? What are you thinking about? There was a river near my house. I used to go for water with my old man. Want to sit? Tell me about him... There's not that much to tell. Well... what did he do? Nothing too special. He grew corn and beans. He had a milpa? Yeah. I read that the beans wrap around the corn... and the two plants help each other grow, right? Yeah. What was it like to work with something so... real? I guess I never really thought about it. Lie down. Close your eyes. They need to rest. The more time I spend connected... the harder it is to see. You have long eyelashes. You'll be alright. Help me disconnect him! You OK? What happened to him? Just pick him up! Let's go! Where are we taking him? This little guy weighs a ton. Put him down for a sec. Code approved. You may exit. I've got it now. Back to work! You OK? You don't look so good. Are you eating well? Sure, Ma. Don't worry. Everything's great here. I don't know how we'd survive without you. No one is allowed anywhere near the dam now. We have to go into town for water. Memo... I'm scared. How could I tell her the truth? I was just figuring it out myself. My energy was being drained... sent far away. What happened to the river, was happening to me. I don't knowwhat I'm doing. I work in a place I'll never see. I can see my family, but I can't touch them. And, well, the only place I feel... connected... is here... with you. There's something I need to tell you. I want you to knowwhat I'm doing. Open "Home". Open "Archive". This is embarrassing. Why? Because I'm still new at this. Open "Maricela". I told you about my ex-boyfriend, right? That's him. Nice hair-do. And that's Maricela. We hooked her up... we became friends and she took me to her village. Going there felt like time travel. Like entering a totally newworld... I wanted to share what I'd seen... so I uploaded the memory - and it sold. I share stories about the people I meet. That's what I wanted to tell you. She invited you to her home... and you sold the memories? Is that bad? No. It's just... weird. I guess it is a little weird... Going there - for me - was like crossing an invisible border. But... I don't know. I had to go. I hate that there's so much distance between people. The only thing nodes are good for... is to destroy that distance... to connect us... to let us see. I want you to see me... inside. Can you see? It's incredible. You've never seen it? This is where the border wall ends. I guess they built it to keep out terrorist surfers. A song for the couple? No thanks. Something for the heart? Try someone over there. Your loss. Nodes? Cables? No, really. Those guys are always here. Always the same routine. You OK? I've been thinking... about what I'm doing here. About my dad. How he died. I told her everything. What kind of a guy he was. I didn't knowwhat to say to him. But I do know... this has to be the final memory in this series. You asked why Memo left his village. Now you know. - How's it going? - Good. Hey, Luz isn't home, but I can let you in. Go on in. There's been activity in your account. A MIGRAN A RE-ENCOUNTER HIS EYES One. What do you want to do with memory one? Play memory. At first I didn't think much of him. He seemed like all the others. I've asked many times, but he won't show me where he lives. He looked so vulnerable... The client purchased a follow-up to this story. Play the memory. How'd you get in here? He needs someone to talk to... He told me his father died. Someone pays you to talk to me? I tried to tell you. I wanted to do something good by telling your story. You understand, right? Never, never, trust a woman with nodes. Am I right? What are you going to do? Go back to the factory. Are you crazy? I can't go home like this... with nothing. When my first wife left me... I put all of our memories on TruNode. It was the happiest day of my life. But still nobody's ever bought them! Right? I want you to have this... Have you ever been there? It's in Oaxaca. A tiny village. I could have stayed. It wouldn't be so bad. Single or double? For you mami, anything. I appreciate it. Approved for entry. Twelve-hour night shift. There has been no activity forten seconds. It's likely you fell asleep. Your salary will be adjusted. I want you to have th is. It's yours. I came here to tell stories. To connect people. But I lost my way. And I'm sorry. ...he eats at the central market every Sunday... it reminds him of home. You don't know me but... I know you. I've been following your story on TruNode. Luz's stories? Yes. I want to talk to you. When I was a kid, my dad brought me here to Tijuana... to visit my grandma... before the wall. When I was young, all I wanted was... to be a soldier, like the rest of my family. So I signed up. And a second later, I'm a pilot. And my first mission... was in Mexico. But I didn't expect... to see... I'm not going to hurt you. Stop! I want to get off! Please! Listen to me! Next stop is up ahead! Just listen to what I have to say... and I'll leave, OK? I was following orders. And I'm sorry. I wish I could change it but... life's not like that. And I don't know. I thought... maybe I could help. You came all the way here to tell me that? That you want to help? How? I just thought... Maybe... And? That I could do something... for you. Anything. Hi. I can't believe you're here. You don't have to say anything. I read your letter. Really, I'm sorry. Luz, I need your help. You want me to plug him in? You want me to plug him in? Yes! This is crazy. He's a killer. He's here because of you. Because of your stories. That doesn't mean we have to help him! Luz, think about it - remember what you told me about crossing to the other side? Yes. That's what he did. He crossed over. All we have to do is help him. Approved for entry. Twelve-hour night shift. Rudy? Memo told you... He told me everything. I'm sorry. It's just that... I've never met one of my readers. Let me see your arms. Code approved. You may exit. Over here. Come on. Almost ready? Just one more minute. Are you sure you want to do this? Yes. Sometimes I'd forget where I was. And everything came back to me. Can we go a little lower? That's good. What's happening? Take it to the left! We're almost there. Water! Water! It's a miracle, Memo. You're not gonna believe it. No one knows what's happening next. If they'll rebuild it, or what. But people are celebrating. Hold on. I'm taking the camera outside. Can you see? So, are you coming home? So long. Heading south? He could never go home. Neither could I. But maybe there's a future for me here. On the edge of everything. A future with a past. If I connect. And fight.
