Talented as you are,|it aint that easy, sport. Every day out here|is like a test of survival. - A test! Beautiful!|- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Good! Baby, I always get my best ideas|when youre around. - Thats why youre my girl.|- Im not your girl. Okay, Scampers,|well give you a shot... but you gotta pass a little test|of courage in Reggies alley. - What? Reggies alley?|- But its never been done before. Come here.

Thatll get ya hard time|in the pound, fella-- attacking a deputy|animal control officers vehicle. And a fine modern machine|like this one at that. Two horsepower,|three miles to the gallon, boy. Hey. You saved my life. Nobody else here|would have dared to do that. - Wow ! Did you see that?|- Is it possible? Scamp is a canine hurricane. You did everyone|a big favour, kay? Oui. You are practically the hero. -Shouldnt we go after him or something?|-Hey, hey, hey, hey. You got it all wrong, kid. In the|junkyard , its every dog for himself. I can see were gonna have|to put you to another test. Any-Anything you say, Buster. - Will somebody open this thing?|- Okay, okay, okay. - Is that open enough?|- Magnifique, Mooch. - Thats using your head.|- Thanks again, huh? You, uh, comin, tenderfoot? I hit the thingy. This is great.|This is living. I never get to do this at home.|Whoo-hoo! After I pass my next test,|lm gonna be... the best junkyard dog|there ever was! I dont think so, doll.|You may be good... but youll never be|as good as the master. - Ah, here we go.|- Rubys right, carnsarnit. In my day, there was only one stray|by which all dogs was measured. - The Tramp.|- Huh? What? He taught Buster everything there is to|know about being on the streets, kay? Busters trouble|was Tramps trouble. And Tramps trouble|was Busters trouble, kay? That dog was a prize,|the one that got away. - Got away from me, at least.|- Got away with everything! I heard he once stole|an entire meat wagon, kay? Yeah, and then the dog catcher|chased him all the way to the river. No, sir.|It was dog catchers. - Uh, how many?|- At least a dozen. - Hey !|- Two dozen. Now that I think about it,|the police and the army cavalry... were after the boy as well. He was trapped. But if the Tramp was gonna go... he was gonna go in style. So what happened? We never saw him again after that. They say when the wind blows... you can still hear|the Tramp howl. - Wow !|- All right, all right. That is not what happened. He met this girl, see?|Bir kpek kulbnn Kraliesiyle Even her prissy little name... still leaves a bad taste|in my mouth. Lady. But he met his true love. He betrayed me! You cant have a family|and still be a junkyard dog. So I gave Tramp a choice.|Its either me or her. And he picked life|on the end of a chain. Hooked up|with a real powder puff. Sleepin on carpets.|Free room and board ! Livin the cushy pillow life ! And thats when I learned the first rule|about being a junkyard dog: Busters trouble|is Busters trouble. Hey ! Hey, hey, hey ! The Tramp used to scratch|like that. - You aint re lated, are ya?|- Who, me? No way ! Good. Cause if you were,|youd be kibble. Right, Buster. No way, Dad.|That cant be true. You gave it all up?|I mean, what could be better than this? - You okay, tenderfoot?|- Who, me? Yeah. Yeah, sure. What are you doing out here?|Dont you have a nice family back home? Wh-Wh-What difference does it make?|All families are alike. They make you take baths|and sleep in a bed... and, and you have to eat|everything in your bowl. And when it rains,|you have to come indoors. Ah. Lets just say youre lucky|youve never had to live with a family. - Wrong again, tenderfoot.|- You mean, you had a family? Actually, Ive had five families. - I always thought one was too many.|- I could never get one to stick. Someone would take me in,|and just when ld start to think. .. Wow, this is my family... theyd move or have a new baby... or have an allergy. Same old story,|lm out on the street. Wait a minute.|You really want a family, dont you? - But youve got Buster.|- Buster! You cant tell him. You cant. - Hell kick me out.|- Dont worry.|Your secrets safe with me. - I promise.|- Thanks. So, I guess youre|Busters girl, huh? I am not Busters girl!|I dont belong to any body. The junkyard dogs arent much|of a family, but what choice do I have? What more do you need?|As a junkyard dog... - you can stay up late or dig or--|- Run. - Yeah. Or, or play or dig or--|- Run. - Right. Or chase squirre is--|- No! I mean, run! Whoo! Come on! Angel! Angel! Angel, help!|Now would be a good time! Hurry! Scamp? Scamp! Scamp! Where are you? Scamp? Scamp! Excuse me.|Im looking for-- I-- I think lm on to somethin. Aye? Are you sure?

Come on.|Weve gotta keep searching. Och! I shouldnt have been|so hard on him. - Hey.|- Oh. Scamp? - Eh.|- Youre all right. I was so worried-- - So worried?|- Yeah, right. Get over yourself, house pet. Theres gotta be a better way|to take a bath, huh? Trust me, there is|no good way to take a bath. Wow ! That is so weird .|Howd you do that? - Talent.|- Let me try. Oh, that was smooth. - You really are a house dog.|- Oh, yeah? - Youre weird .|- Uh, no, youre the weird one. - Oh, yeah?|- Scamp. # I never had this feeling before # # She gives me shakes and shivers|I cant ignore # # And I see that theres more now # # Than just running free # # I never felt my heart beat so fast # # Im thinking of him first|and of my self last # # And how happy # # I want him to be # # Its amazing|someone in my life # # just might be loving me # # I didnt know|that I could feel this way # # Its so crazy|Something in my life # # Is better than a dream # # I didnt know|that I could feel this way # # She makes me|warm and happy inside # # He smiles, and I get dizzy|and starry-eyed # # All these feelings I have # # Have me asking # # Can this be love # # Can this be love # # - Its crazy# |#- I can hardly speak # #- Whenever she# |#- Whenever he # # Says hi # # Ididnt know that I could feel # # I never dreamed that I could feel # # I didnt know that I could feel # # This # # Way # - Whoa, nice neighbourhood.| - Snob Hill. Hey, jim Dear|never leaves this gate open. - Come on, Tramp.|- Oh, no! We gotta get outta here. Why? Whats wrong? Come on, boy.|Weve done all we can for one day. Oh, well find him. You were|the best street dog there ever was. And I still have faith|in the old Tramp. Old Tramp? Hmph. If only the old Tramp|was still here. Come on, Tramp!|Well find Scamp tomorrow. - The Tramp is your father?|- I, um-- Wait. No, wait! Angel, wait! - Did you find him?|- May be tomorrow. Scamp. Bad Scamp. - Gosh, I didnt think|theyd miss me that much.|- You didnt think theyd miss you? I cant believe youd run away|from a home like this. - Well, you dont know what it was like.|- No, I dont. Whoo, must have been horrible having|someone care about you that much. I need to be wild and free.|Ill never find that here. Id give anything|to have what you have. And ld give anything|to have what you have. Come on, Scamp.|We could run off together. We dont need them. Angel, dont you understand? Only one more test,|and Ill finally be a junkyard dog. - Thats where I belong.|- No, you dont belong there. Youre better than that, Scamp,|and thats what I like about you. Come on, tenderfoot.|Lets go. - Wow !|- Wow ! Look! I really think|we should keep searching. Oh, nonsense!its the Fourth of july.|Time to have some fun. You can continue your search|after our picnic. Aunt Sarah, were not really|in the mood to celebrate. Oh, come now. Scamp will be all right.|Youll find him. But, first, lets eat. I wont have my Fourth of july|ruined by that little Scamp. There, there, boy. I knew it. Beautiful. Scampo!|Front and centre. Take a look out there.|See that family? You-- You mean|that family over there? No, this family right here. Now, as your final test,|I want you to infiltrate their picnic... and liberate their chicken... right out from under the nose|of that meek, little house dog. You dont have to prove anything, Scamp.|just walk away. - Since when do you care so much?|- I thought you were better than this. Pipe down, Angel cakes!

I go wherever I want, do whatever|I please. No chains, no fences-- No regard for someone elses lunch? Thats how it is|out here on the streets. But then, you know|all about that, dont you? You make the rules, Dad,|but you didnt have to follow them|when you were my age. Is that why you didnt tell me|you were a street dog? I didnt want that life for you|because I found something better. - I found love.|- Oh, aw, aint that beautiful?
