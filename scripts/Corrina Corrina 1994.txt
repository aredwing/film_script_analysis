Annie looked so gorgeous... laid out with all those flowers around her. It just looked like she was taking a nap. We bought that dress together. She said she didn't have any place to wear it. Where's Molly? She's probably in her room. I better go. Check, see how she's doing. Doris, I can't believe you. Where's my head? So what's the matter? Everybody on a hunger strike or something? Eve, I was just having one of yourfamous cookies. Fabulous. They're not too sweet. Two cups sugarfor a wedding... one cup for a funeral... and today I used half a cup. It seemed right. Easy on that strudel, Harry. Mollinchka. You try that apricot Bundt cake? The only thing I haven't eaten is the tablecloth. Poor kid. Thank goodness she's so young. If she's lucky, she won't remember. Don't tell me I lost Harry. Mollinchka. What are you doing, my darling? Come here. I'll see you, Dad. OK. Bus is leaving. All right. Here we go. All right. OK. Sid, give me the duck. Give me the duck. I'm sorry. I just miss Annie already. Shirl, please, huh? OK, OK. I love you sweetie, OK? Good-bye, princess. You'll give us a call? Hon, please. Take care, old man. You'll call? Say good-bye to Grandma and Grandpa. Don't you want to wear the matching top? Want me to sing you a lullaby? What was the song that Mommy sang to you? How does that go? Want to teach me a lullaby to sing to you every night? Here's a fun one. Oh, the coffee that they give you They say it's mighty fine It's goodfor cuts and bruises And tastes like iodine Oh, I don't want no more of army life Gee, Mom, I wanna go Gee... We're going to be fine, Molly. Justfine, you and me. I'm glad to see your smilingface. I haven't gotten lamb chop to smile all day. Salisbury steak... for madame... and veal parmigiana for me. There you go. Look, Molly. Tater tots. Yourfaves. Mmm. Very good, very good. You want to get that? I didn't think so. And a sore throat. Hey, hi, Sid. I'm not ready to come back to work quite yet. I have some people coming by tomorrow... that might stay with Molly so I can leave. I start at eight o'clock. I will have had my breakfast... and I assume the child will have had hers. At noon, a brisk walk... followed by two hours of Bible study. Where is the child? lfeel like Sophia Loren in "Houseboat..." when she meets the widowed Cary Grant... and selflessly gives herself to his family. Did you see it? I know what it's like... to lose someone close to your heart. I understand. Winnie and I, we both understand. I'm so tired. And I'm not tired? Kids. Oh, I love kids. I have a real way with children. And no windows! I get very nervous. If I put my head down between my legs, I'll be better. I realize it's your decision... but I also sing. Won't you come home, Bill Bailey? Won't you come home? I cried the whole day long Kids love that. Kids love me, Mr. Singer. I walk into a room full of kids... they drift to me... like a goddamn kid magnet. Uh, let's see. I'm not sure where to begin. Well, Mr. Jones died... and we never had any children... and believe me... I would treat your little Molly... with all the love and tenderness... I'd have given my own. OK, sweetpea. Let's see about making you some breakfast. What might be good? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Jonesy's famous pancakes will loosen you up. Just making sure we got all the makings. Oh, boy. Aren't we havingfun? It's for after work. Thanks. She's been playing that little ditty all day. Maybe you could talk to her about that. Her mother was teaching her that. Hide-and-seek noodle casserole. Peekaboo. This is just the first course. Looks fabulous. The other courses... they're hidden throughout the room. I'm just kidding. Chicken Marengo. That looks fabulous. Doesn't it, Mol? I bet your wife wasn't this good a cook. You think? Huh? No, it is perfectly all right, Mr. Singer. Kids sometimes go through a very tough time. Why don't you just... No, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Just... Justfinish your... What are you doing? I'm doing everything a wife does. Shouldn't I be getting everything a wife gets? Hello, kid. My name's Corrina. I bet you're Molly. I hear you don't like talking much these days... but that's all right with me... because it makes my job a lot easier. Nice wheels. When would you like me to start? Why don't you have a seat here? I thought we would talk a bit. Talk. All right. How long have you lived in the house? Three years. Do you have any references... Have you had maids before? My wife used to take care of everything. So you're a beginner. Let's get some things straight. Yes, let's. Salary does not include supplies... Excuse me. Did the agency explain to you... that this is just an interview? Look, Mr. Singer, what shall we discuss? Children. I was wondering... if you had any experience with children. You know, I met your little girl out there. She's got your eyes. Do you have any references? Do you have a rsum or anything? Thanks. "Professor Louise Gordon. "Fisk University." How long were you with her? Four years. What happened then? I graduated. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Singer. That's OK. Well, if you had some glue... I'm really good at gluing. I could just glue it. I mean, I could just snap this back together. No. I'll take care of it. Thanks for coming by. Mr. Singer, I'm having a really bad day... and I'm sure you know what that's like. I really need this job. Thanks for coming by. I'll let you know. Where is my music? Not in the refrigerator, that's for sure. Iforgot. You'll have to do a marketing. We're going to need... We'll need, um... I noticed there's a list started there. Yeah, it's my wife's writing. I haven't wanted to... Well, I'll just add on from there. You and Corrina are going to go shopping... for some breakfast and pick up some other things. The keys to my wife's car are on the dresser. Do you know how to drive? I'm an old pro. I was just testing the brakes. It'll do your heart good to know they're fine. I made a slight booboo... which I hope you won't tell yourfather about. But you won't because you don't talk. You're the short, silent type, aren't you? Oh, here she comes. A hip-hap-hoppy good morning to you. Welcome to Terry's Diner. So glad you came that extra mile for breakfast with a smile. I'll be right there! So, what'll it be for starters? I need a cup of your strongest coffee. Would you like a hot cocoa? Pecan waffles? What about the Slim Starter? Ladies, I ain't got all day. Wilma, where's your boss? He's inside. Why don't you slip into the backseat. I got to talk to my friend here. I know what you're going through. I used to do this. Come on in. OK. Just a minute. She's coming over the side. You in? All right. You all right? Molly, I understand that you don't want to talk. I know you have your reasons. But we have to figure out a way to communicate... so if I ask you something and the answer is yes... pat your nose like that. Then I'll know. If the answer is no, don't do anything. Do you want to have the pecan waffles... with lots and lots of syrup and butter? All right. That's good, what you're doing. Would you rather have the Slim Starter... with cottage cheese... the hard-boiled egg, and the tomato? Honey, if it's a choice between those pecan waffles... and that stupid egg... for God sakes, pat your little nose. Good try, Wilma. Ah! She did it! She did it! Mr. Potato Head. Mr. Potato Head. Mister... Potato Head... Was alone in his bed. I love it. I love it. Mr. Potato Head, the untold story. Sid, I have a great opening here. I tried, uh... I'm with you. Come on. I know how hard it's been. We're in this together, OK? I appreciate that. Thanks. Absolutely. Imagine how hard things would be... if the job got shaky. What do you mean? Did someone say something? - Absolutely not. - Sid, tell me. Once. Maybe a couple times. It's always said very affectionately... at least to me. I say the old Manny Singer's going to be back. They say when? And I say any day now. They say great. It'll be your job, too. It's all very positive feedback. Sunglasses Yeah, we bought some sunglasses 'Cause sunglasses Protect our eyes from the sun You look good. Sunglasses Anybody want some more? Anybody want any? No, no, no. It's good. Just a little more spice than we're used to. It was just to bring out the flavor. It's good. It's just, you know, a little... Spicy. Yeah. Ya-da da da da da You can make him funny Or you can make him sunny He's Mr. Potato Head Oh, yes, it's true he's lumpy OK, he's kind of dumpy He's not a French fry He's the potato to buy Did you like it? You think my boss is going to like it? Maybe the iambic pentameter's off just a bit. Yes, it's true he's lumpy OK, he's kind of dumpy Now, you thought that was clunky, didn't you? Just knew we were in sync. lambic pentameter. Where do you want it? Sorry. I think you have the wrong address. Why don't I just talk to Mrs. Singer? She's, um... She's in the bathtub right now. I bet if you're on the inside of a maraca... that's what it would sound like. Excuse me, but I'm ticklish. Stop that! Oh, wait. I hate to impose... but could you give me a little help? I can't do this last one on my own. Ah! You know, the first time I saw you... I knew you had this magic. Here's another one. Give me a hand. Well done. I think your dad's really going to like... this present you picked out. We have to emphasize that you picked it out yourself. Hey, Molly, it's time to eat. Come on, and bring Lois. Would you like to be queen for a day? What do you listen to this garbage for? Why are you watching this? Queen for a day. I knew a guy in my neighborhood, wanted to be queen for a day. You know what happened to him? Her husband was killed in the Air Force. She has three children. She'd like a trained dog to ease her mind. My husband's gone, too. That doesn't make me a queen, does it? Ladies and gentlemen... we've heard from all of our contestants. Is it going to be Lois? Numberfive! Queen for a day! Yes! Yes, Lois! Queen Lois! All I askedfor was a dog... and look what I'm getting. I want to thank everyone out there... everyone who made this possible... Lois made a sissy on the couch. You know what I think, Molly? I think your mom's looking down at youfrom heaven right now. And if you look really closely... I'll bet you'll see she's waving. I really appreciate everything you're doing here... and whatever you believe in is fine. OK, your heaven is fine for you. Molly's mother was an atheist and so am I. I don't want you telling her... she's somewhere she isn't, OK? Yes, Mr. Singer. I'll just continue to tell Molly her mother's in the bathtub. Did you ever undress in front of a dog? What's the matter, sweetie? Can't sleep? Did you have a bad dream? You OK? How about I break out some graham crackers... and we'll sit and watch the late-late show... till youfall asleep, OK? Don't hit your nose. I'll go get the stuff. A recent report from the Surgeon General... links cigarette smoking to lung cancer. Statistics show that one out of every ten male smokers... will die from lung cancer. Meanwhile, in Washington today... President Eisenhower announced that he'll... Here you go, Mol. ...fact-finding tour to South America. The vice president will visit Venezuela, Argentina... Molly, what... what are you doing? Molly, look... Cigarettes are for adults. I'll get you bubblegum cigarettes tomorrow. Molly, stop it! Now, what's the matter? I really feel like I should stay. Well, it's your house. I just can't be late for this meeting. l... Then you better go. You know what it is? Mr. Potato Head's in from Trenton. I can't be late. Really? The Mr. P? The one and only. You better get your heinie going. Yeah. I'm gone. Bye. All right, well... Bye. Thanks. You know what I discovered about your dad? He likes to eat cookies in bed. Can you get that cornerfor me? Just pull it down, right there... The white one. Thank you. Malamutes or whatever they call those things... they look like little humps. This is where my mommy sleeps. You're right. Your mommy used to sleep here. When's she coming back? You know, Molly, I... She's not coming home... because when you die... the angels take you up to heaven. Well, then I want to die, too. Now, darling, you don't want to die. It's too soon. Was I bad? No. People don't die because you're bad. They die because it's their time. Lots of things happen... but no, you... You were not bad at all. You're wonderful. And think of all the people who are here now who love you. They'd be so sad and upset if you went. And your daddy loves you. He really needs you, too. But my dad doesn't think she's in heaven. Well, maybe deep down inside he does... and he's just so jealous of those angels... who get to play with your mommy every day... he just can't bring himself to say so. 'Cause he's hurting, like you're hurting. And you're going to hurt for a long time. Every day it will get a little bit better... but you'll always miss your mommy, and that's OK. You know the other thing? How many of the thirty-one flavors have you tasted? Chocolate and vanilla. Well, that's my point. That is my point. No one should go anywhere until they've tried... mint on the rocks and cherries jubilee and bing bang cherry. So much for you to do. I'm home! Look, Daddy... I made you some pig knuckles. Ohh, that's wonderful. I'm so happy. Think someone's inviting you to dinner. Thank you very much, but maybe another time. No, I'd like you to join us, too. Well, l... Here, have a seat. I guess I don't have much of a choice. Oh, here. Have one of mine. I'll have one with you. So pretty. It's Erik Satie, a French composer. Yes, I know. He was twenty-two when he wrote this. Can you imagine being so poised... and having such boldness in a composition... when you're only twenty-two? Can Corrina sleep over tonight? She's got to get home to her husband. No, she doesn't. Her husband's gone. I'll get it. No, no, I'll get it. You're our guest. What happened to Mr. Potato Head's wife? Um, oh, she's around. As a matter of fact... here she is. You want to split this? - No, thank you. - Sure? Go ahead. Is tater tot Mr. Potato Head's son? That's funny, Molly. Well, yeah, he's theirfirstborn. Thank you. Oh, boy! I got it. Butterfingers. Corrina, did your husband die like Mommy did? No, baby. Though it is hard to tell... with old Edward B. Washington. He said he was going out for cigarettes... and never came back... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's... that's OK. I'm sorry. I'll get it. No, I'll get it. You just sit. I'll take care of it. Thank youfor inviting me to dinner. Thank you very much... but I just made enough for two, and I have to go. You can make him funny You can make him sunny His name is Mr. Potato Head There's something I wanted to tell you guys... that I thought you'd get a big kick out of. The other day, my seven-year-old asks... You're going to love this... We all love kids. Uh, she asked me... is... is tater tots Mr. Potato Head's son? Illegitimate. My wife would have loved that... um, the way kids' minds work. That's the kind of thing we'd talk aboutfor hours... laughing. She had this great laugh. Sid, I'm sorry. Stop it. Stop it. They could see where you were going with it. I had a small stroke, but they were fine. - You did? - Stop it. That's not why I'm here. Sunday... Shirl and the boss' new squeeze... are throwing a party at his place. I can't Sunday. I have Molly. She'll understand. Get a sitter, OK? Sunday, get a sitter. Work, work, work. Talk, talk, talk.

Babaloo Loo loo loo Halftime. Nap time. No more noise from you, Percy. You're not my mama. You can't tell me what to do. Good night. Come on up, Percy. Ain't you lonely there? Yuck! I don't want to sleep with no girls. Now, look, this is nice, huh? That's cute. You can'tfit in that. I can fit in that. Have you seen what's behind you recently? Let me turn to the maternity page. Maternity? Come on, now. This about where you are. You done had three kids. If you'd kept that nickel... between your knees like mama said... you'dfit in that tiny outfit. You talk more stuff. I know I do. - Listen, Corrina... - What? More importantly... why you giving Anthony such a hard time? Oh, please. Anthony. Anthony. That's who I'm talking about. Why? Because, in the words of Gertrude Stein, girl... "There is no there, there." Oh. And you think there is in there? What? I don't care what yourfriend Gertrude says... there's more with Anthony... than there's ever going to be in there. So there. Relax. She's divorced, feels the same way you do. Sid, it's too soon. To talk to a woman? She needs a ride home. Shirl and I thought... Is this high school? Sid, please. I know how youfeel. I'm yourfriend... No, you don't. You don't know how lfeel. I don't know how youfeel, all right? I don't know how youfeel at all. But the guys at work have an idea how youfeel. They've got problems of their own. The bottom line is... you need someone to talk to. You have me, butfrankly, I'm not thatfond of you. And... and all of a sudden out of the blue... Molly says, "Is tater tots Mr. Potato Head's son?" Oh, that is what is called adorable. Oh, kids, huh? Yeah. Just the way they work. They're... Where you on the night of April thirty-first? How much money do you make?

"Make sure you get tickets for three, not two." Um, Daddy can'tfly right now. I've had a really hard day. You just get ready for sleep. Hey, Daddy-O. Every cat talks to God in his own way... and God understands Chinese. So Corrina says don't be jealous of the angels. Bo, Daddy, bo. What did Corrina say? Corrina said you're jealous of the angels. Why? Because they get to spend all that time with Mommy. Molly, listen to me, OK? Heaven... the angels and all of that... It's just something that people make up... so they won'tfeel sad anymore. Well, what's wrong with that? What color eyes did Mommy have? I can't remember. Let's talk about it later. No, now. It's time for bed. What'd she smell like? Molly, I said we'll talk about it later. Liar. You don't even remember her anymore. Of course I do. No, you don't. She's disappearing. She's almost all gone. No! I don't want to go! What is the matter? There's nothing to be afraid of. You're not going to come back. What did you say to me? You're not coming back. I'll be back at three. You promise? Oh, yeah, I promise. Now, come on. Maybe they won't like me. Maybe they won't like you? Are you kidding? Have you looked in the mirror today? That's the most likable face in America. We're going about this the wrong way. You have to think to yourself... "My name is Molly Singer... "and there's no one in the world better than me." That's what you got to say to yourself. Try it. "I am Molly Singer... "and there's nobody in the world better than me." Now, walk right in there... say that as you're walking. Go ahead. I am Molly Singer... and there's nobody in the world better than me. I am Molly Singer... and there's nobody in the world better than me. Chin up! Up! You're too young to have two. Goodfor you. Pinky. Oh. Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late. Oh, I'm sorry, too.

What a dodo head. I'm Molly Singer... and there's nobody in the world better than me. Nobody stupider than you. Give me that crayon. I think Ed Sullivan should run for president... because he knows lots of different kinds of people... and could help keep world peace... because he's very good with Russian acrobats. Topo Gigio.

I guess I'm just going to have to carry you. I can't get you off. Come on, kid. What a day I've had. Worked my tail off andfor what? I'm starving. Where are my cigarettes? I just put a carton in there this week. I don't see them. I can't even offer you one of mine... since you've smoked them, too. What is that supposed to mean? If you're going to smoke my cigarettes, tell me. Fine. If you're gonna smoke my cigarettes... I'd appreciate if you told me. All right. Great. Molly, wake up. Wake up. She didn't turn around. Who? Mommy... She was on the hill. I saw her... and she didn't turn around. She just kept walking. Molly, if I'd been there... You were there. You couldn't stop her. Why couldn't you? She walked through you. It's yourfault she's gone. You never talked about her. You made her disappear. It's all yourfault she's gone. I hate you! Molly, that's enough. It's OK. But I'm just so...

"Listenin' Up" with Corrina Washington. Not that it would, you know... take away my joy and love... at scrubbing wax buildup from linoleum floors. Did you ever try? What, scrubbing wax buildup? No, no, no. Liner notes and poetry. Basically, they just let us play the music. They don't let us write about it. This is really bad. I wouldn't say it's really bad. I would.

How very nice to meet you. I hear you're a real wonder with children. Catrina, could you get us an ice bucket and two glasses? You know, uh, I'll do that. Gosh, aren't those lovely flowers? Has anybody seen my cigarettes? I just got you a carton. I can't help it if you're tearing through them. You know... the three of you could go for a drive... and maybe pick some up. Or... this is what is called a good time to quit. You're so right. Good night. Something sure smells good. I'll turn off the oven.

It's just a bit tastier. This is all very new... for me. This is all very confusing. I just don'tfeel like I'm ready to get... Oh, Manny, I know. I know. I know how hard it is to let yourself love again. But... Would you like a cigarette? No. I don't smoke. Maybe you should start. Maybe you should get some sleep. That's a pretty frock, Molly... but it's a little late for dress-up. Excuse me. You know what's going on here? My dad's in the living room with Jenny. I don't want to hear it. Go to sleep. I can't go to sleep... if I have to go back to school. Please? All right. I'll think about it... if you promise to go right to sleep. OK. I promise. I love you. I love you, too, Molly, OK? Go to sleep now. I'll sing you to sleep first, though. Molly, please... Hush, little lady, don't say a word Molly's going to buy you a mockingbird If that mockingbird don't sing Molly's going to buy you a diamond ring If that diamond ring don't shine It's been a long time since I've been serious about it... but I still play a little piano. I used to sing myself. No kidding? Bus driver was twenty minutes late. I have to talk to you. Corrina. Corrina, we need to tal... Whether you like it or not, I employ you. Oh, yes, you did. I meant to tell you I'm giving you my notice. What? A week in advance, which is fair. Listen, about last night... This is what is called one week's notice, Mr. Singer. Listen to me, please. Jenny's a friend of mine. I wasn't expecting her to come over. And what I really wanted was you to stay. l... I just wanted to apologize. Well, thank you. But let's get one thing straight. All right. This is my job. I work for you. Nine to five. Time and a half for overtime. No more. No less. Absolutely. Fine. I'm really running late. I'll be home, um, aroundfive. Will you just wait a minute? Turn around. You have the thing that's all messed up. I tell you, Manfred... I think she's spending too much time... with this Mrs. Washington. Go. Tell me I'm wrong. Give a look at your baby. Am I blind, or is she becoming a sh... Ma, enough. Kids are impressionable, that's all. Corrina's the best thing that could have happened to her. Try the light. Grandma... you've got water spots on your glasses. Maybe you're using the wrong soap. Since when did you become such an expert on cleaning? Ah. Which reminds me... did you see how the crystal sparkled... at Jenny's house? Ma, please. Don't start. Please? Listen, Manny, it wouldn't be so bad... for yourfather to see you... with a lovely new wife while he's still here. Ma, nobody's going anywhere. You'll both be around to dance at Molly's wedding. Oy, Molly's wedding. Look. Ha ha. Show me an "A." And a C-sharp. That was beautiful, Harry. Before you skedaddle, maestro... could you spare a moment... to fix the light in the Frigidaire? Ma, the light works fine. So, are we going to talk about it or what? Grandpa, can you hear me? Make Daddy marry Corrina, OK? I told you, she's the best thing in the worldfor Molly. Look at her. She's glowing. Manny, I wasn't born today. It's just a tremendous relief to... You were kissing Mrs. Washington on your steps. What? I got a call from your neighbor Mrs. Murphy. This is sick. This is really sick. Don't worry about Mrs. Murphy. She's a small, unhappy woman with bigfeet. But that's the world. It may not be a perfect world, but it's the world we live in. Listen to what I'm telling you, Manfred. Afish and a bird can fall in love... but where will they build their nest? It's flying! There it is. It's flying! Look, guys. Look at that. Here it is. Here it is, here. I'll get it. I'll get it! In the tree? In the sandbox. In the sandbox. What the... This isn't a joke. You have some explaining to do, young lady. Cigarettes cost money. They're not your toys. Now why did you do a thing like that? Corrina's husband went outfor a pack of cigarettes and died. What are you saying? They all die. That's what the TV says. Even the Surgery General says it. You have my promise... that I will never, ever, ever leave you... ever. Promise? Because Mommy says... it's bad to be a breaker of promises. Yeah, she did say that. You see? We remember. You know what? If Mommy were here right now, she'd be smiling. She had the bluest, bluest eyes... just like yours. Blue like mine? Mm-hmm. And you know what else? Yep. She smelled just like you do. What was that? What? Did you hear that? Think it was a plane. Who wants to take a trip to Kalamazoo? Make sure you get tickets for three, not two! Come here! Let's go fly. Here you go. I'll have this one. I want chocolate! Appreciate your patience. They had to special order the fabric from France. Your wife had taste. Yes, she did. Wasn't great with dimensions, though. Well, nobody's perfect. One of the last things my wife said to me... was don'tforget to pick up some almonds... on the way home. She said she had a coupon for roasted. But I was in a hurry... and I didn't wait till she found it. I don't think she was angry, Manny. I think she understood. Now, do you want to know... the last thing I said to my husband? What? Slow down. Slow... down. You have such an amazing smile. Wanna dance? What? You want to dance? Sure. Been a while for me. Look at the window. What? Take a look at the window. I have to go. I beg your pardon, madam, but I have a giftfor you. Now close your eyes. Here you are. I made this specialfor you... in honor of you going back to school tomorrow... so that you have a place... to put all your papers, poems, drawings... and you can show them to your dad. Here. I don't think anyone else at your school... has anything like this. Did you notice that was Lois on the cover there? I just wanted to point that out to you. Yes, Gregory, what is it? I was just wondering when Molly Singer... would be coming back to class. She'll be back as soon as she's all better. That means that she'll be here later today? What makes you say that, Gregory? She's been very sick. Hello, Mrs. Rodgers. How are you? What? Where's Molly? She's in the room. How dare you keep her out of school and not tell me. There's an explanation. There is no explanation. She just wasn't ready. Corrina, I trusted you. She was not ready to go back. She was not ready. Corrina, you're not her mother. That's not your decision. How dare you lie to me, Corrina. Just stay away. You're fired, Corrina. Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie to me? What are you doing? Molly, you have to talk to me. Go on. What happened? Jesus! Mom, this isn't a good time right now. Let me call you back later. What? Howard, here. Why don't you take this piece of cake over to Grandma. Pardon me, but could you slow down? Mrs. Singer just hired me. All the ashtrays emptied, please... and another pot of hot coffee. Got it. How are you? Where's the coffee? Come on, Lois. You got to eat. You know, I can stay... make a little dinner. Untie him right now. I'll clean up a little. I can put Molly to bed. You need me right now. That's OK. I appreciate it. All right. Well... what are you doing with that? I was going to surprise you... and get it restored. I bet I can get rid of all these cracks. I like the cracks. No, you don't. Yeah, I do. I like them a lot. You are what is called... Upset. Well, perhaps you need a little time. We'll, um... We'll talk later. All right, boys. Come on. Let's go now. Come on. Right now. Thanks for everything. Uh-oh. He's back. Come in the house, Percy. Quick! I should have called. My father died... and... it gets you to thinking... about the people that you love... the things that you've done... wish you hadn't done. Corrina, your supper's getting cold. I'm really sorry about yourfather. I liked him a lot. I'm sorry. I don't want the last words I said to you to be... It's all right. You know... I'm not very good at this. Can you please help me out here... just this once? Who are you talking to? What's-his-name. Oh, a new friend. I made this for Molly. Would you like to give it to her yourself? I might. Good. I just want to clear up one thing. Really clear. So there's no mistake. I quit. You'll be happy to know that I hired somebody else. I think you'll like him. - Did you check their references? - Yeah. Good, because you're no picnic. I know. I live in this neighborhood. Come inside. Come on. Come on. Come on. That's the funniest thing you ever told me in your whole life. This is Manny. Hello, everybody. - Good to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. Percy, get your jaw off the table. Pull up an extra seat. Is this Mr. Puddin' Face? Yes, this is the face himself. Sit there. Go ahead. Sit there. What's your name? Percy. Thank you, Percy. You're welcome. You know, you can eat all my vegetables if you want. Shine, shine, shine Let it shine All through the night I'm gonna let it shine All through the night I'm gonna let it shine Grandma, that's your part. Mollinchka, enough. I'll sing it with you.
