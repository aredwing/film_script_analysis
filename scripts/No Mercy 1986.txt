I'm gonna take the family out to dinner with this? You have the wrong attitude about this job, Eddie. You gotta appreciate the Zen aspects. Zen aspect? What's a Zen aspect? - Joey, you holding out on me? - No. You doing reefer, or is the old lady on her cycle again? Why do you ask that? Because once a month you get bullshit-philosophical. It happens when you're married, Eddie. Didn't that happen to you? No way. I'm old-fashioned. I'd go to the Cubs game and drink. Miss the whole thing. Maybe that's why you're not married anymore. Angles Ryan again. Third time today. Fourth. You were in the can. Isn't that White Fang talking to him? He got the teeth on a postal rap. The feds are good about dental work. Bring it in, come on. A little more. Okay, put it in neutral. You want the super wax with the Rust-O-Protector...? Just a regular wash. Thank you. Do the ashtray? I don't smoke. Get out of here. Going down, Joey, I know it. If we get them after the exchange, they'll cop possession without intent. What are you doing? Joey... ...I hope you appreciate the Zen aspects of what I'm about to do. Police! What the fuck? What's the matter with you? What are you doing? Police! Open up! Open up! Chicago Police! Get the fuck out! What are you, nuts? Joey, get the bag. Police! You're under arrest! Put it in there! Get that out of here! You're gonna destroy my interior! I'll fuck you up now, boy! Let go, Ryan! The keys! Give me the goddamn keys, Ryan! Get out of the car! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Get out of the fucking car. Get them up there! You got a piece? Down! Down! Down! Fucking move, and you're dead meat! It's grass. All we got is grass. Rat shit. Three frigging days I'm out there washing cars. You disrespect me with this shit? - We're sending you up. - Hard time, Ryan. Come on. It was less than a pound. - That is a felony, dipshit! - You're a three-time loser. Take it easy. Take it easy. You guys are playing it all wrong. One of you is supposed to be nice. Youse both not supposed to be hard. Hard? You don't know hard. You're going to the joint with the brothers. Know what they'll do to your ass? - Hey, a little bit of reefer was... - Sit down! Take it easy, will you? You guys wanna make a deal? All right. I'll give you something. Let's see. I got a record store. They got hot TVs. They got stereos. You give me a two-bit fence after making me wash cars? - You know what that does to me? - I can think of bookies! You're doing hard time for pushing smoke! Six years, minimum! No, wait. Wait a minute! You guys can't put me away. I got freckles, for chrissakes! I got something for you! I got a hit! They want me to kill somebody. You? Who's the target? I don't know. - Don't insult our intelligence. - A guy from New Orleans. I swear. Wants me to wax some guy out. I'm supposed to meet him. This guy, he knows your face? This has gotta be worth something. Where's the meeting? Tonight at the Stockyard Inn at 9:00. He's gonna be with a girl. A real heart-stopper. She's got a tattoo on her shoulder. That's all I know. My hat! My cigarettes! Hey! Why don't we check out that New Orleans guy? Come on, I'm tired. I wanna go home. What's so great about going home... ...finding a bongo player in the rack with your old lady? She's not like that. My wife left a typewritten note on the refrigerator... ...saying she was leaving so she could breathe. Last time it was on the bathroom mirror. Get your facts straight, Jillette. I'm trying to share a valuable, personal experience with you. Don't drink my coffee from my cup, Jillette! I swear, I met a better type of cop in Vice. Crabs and gonorrhea, that's all I worried about. It's just a cup, Stemkowski. Captain Stemkowski! What are you so mad about? I was meditating... ...feeling real good about myself. What happens? Car washes happen! They say that balloon robot was a work of art! We gotta talk. Why should I talk after that chickenshit stakeout? What do you want? Overtime? - A hundred grand, Jillette. - A hundred? That's what he wants for it. Guy wants to go to Florida and retire. - Captain? - Forget it! Come on, let's do it ourselves. Blow off some steam. You just wanna see the broad, Jillette. What's wrong with that, Joey? I don't see any heart-stoppers here. These broads still got the price tag hanging from their nose. Nice, nice. There's the dickdipper we're looking for. Maybe she's his sister. She's got "Born to screw" tattooed on her forehead. - Don't be bitter. - Me, bitter? - I know the secret to happiness. - What? A girl with freckles on her tits. Can I help you? You got it wrong. Oh, of course. Sit down. Outside. - We're just about to order. - Outside. Nice, Eddie. Nice. You got a hard-on for this girl, so you gotta go and jump on this guy. You blew it. He's looking for a Chicago shooter. What should I do? - Swap spit with him, blow in his ear? - Works for me. That's not what your wife says. I'd be offended if you didn't owe me money. - You're such a romantic. - You're the romantic one, Eddie. That's your problem. You wired? Ever since we walked in, I thought we were being watched. He's clean. Satisfied? Nothing personal. Just want to make sure you're not cops. Of course. Get your car and follow me. I have a problem in New Orleans I'd like taken care of. So why not use local? The man I want you to do business with is very connected. He'd know if I used local. Why do you want him hit? - Is that important? - Stay out of this, lady. - I don't like the way you say lady. - The cost? A lot more than her. Drop this guy. He's a loser. You want me to go to a strange city and make a hit? I gotta know who the guy is. Let this broad go down on you, she runs your life. You don't have the guts to hit him yourself... ...or to keep your woman in her place! I think we can do business. I don't know, Eddie. They're not buying it. She's giving me attitude, that's all. This guy's dying to talk. Think he's smart. Give me an hour. Take her back to her hotel. And do what? - What do you usually do? - Nothing. I'm married. Get the car, Joey. Wait for me in the room. - Where you staying? - Ambassador East, the penthouse. You and I should take a ride. Fine. She's not what you think. - She's an exceptional woman. - Yeah, sure. Who's the guy you want hit? The man in question is very dangerous. Enjoys violence. Michel says some women find him attractive because of that. What does she care? She belongs to him. What does that mean? In our society it's very pleasurable to be a man. You have somebody follow us? No. Get out of the car. Get out of the car! Move it! Get out! I can't! I can't get out! This isn't a job for you. - We can handle it. - Your friend, maybe. But not you. Go home to your wife. What makes you think I'm married? I can tell. You don't belong here. I'm waiting for Eddie. Stop! I'm a police officer! Stop the fucking car! Stop it! Where you going? It's over. What's over? Life, my friend. All right, now. Hold it. I'm a police officer. My partner's in trouble. Get out of the elevator. I want you to call 911 and get help right away! Out of the elevator. - Make the call. - Get out. Make the call! Police! Joey? Joey? How you doing? You okay? Eddie, what happened? He was waiting for me. I was late. He always tried to prepare me for this. It's part of being a cop's wife, right? He'd want you to have that. He loved you. You look like stale piss. What were you and Collins doing with the victim? He thought we were hit men. He wanted us to whack a guy in New Orleans. Jesus Christ! Who was this guy? Paul Deveneux. Sent a bag of ashes to his family in New Orleans. Real sweethearts. Whoever Deveneux wanted to waste, he got him first, huh? So who was this? I never got a name. That's great, Jillette. What were you two doing? Driving around in the moonlight? You talk to the cops down there? You tell them about Joey? They say that's our problem. My problem. It's different down there. You don't know New Orleans. They don't even talk like us. I'll make myself understood. Mr. Deveneux will see you now. Thanks. Detective Jillette. Allan Deveneux. I'm Paul's cousin. I talked to your superiors. I don't know what I can add. Bernice, Mr. Jillette. And Susan is Paul's wife. I know this is difficult, but I'd like to ask a few questions. - Mint julep? - No, thanks. What business was your husband in? Agriculture, oil, that sort of thing. - Was he having any financial problems? - We never discussed them. Was anything troubling him? Any enemies? Not that I know of. I knew very little about Paul's personal life. Know what he was doing in Chicago? He hired me to kill somebody. Susan has been under terrible strain, and that kind of inquiry won't help. - Does Michel mean anything to you? - No. She was with him. Tattoo on her right shoulder. A tattoo? I'm gonna miss Paul. He was a very amusing man. I appreciate your coming down here. I wish I could help more. It seems your people don't know a great deal... ...apart from a lady with a tattoo. - You find that amusing? I need to see his personal papers: Phone bills, credit cards, address books. I don't intend to prolong this tragedy. I hope you understand. - I understand. - Goodbye, Mr. Jillette. Now, you should understand me. I don't drink mint juleps, and I don't care... ...about you or your batshit dead cousin. I'm looking for the bastard that gutted my partner. And with or without your help, I'll get him. You've just made a very big mistake. About you? About you? You? No. Not about you. The place your mother warned you about! Male and female shows on-stage. Disgusting! You'll love this. And you get in free right now. Men and women. They're all real, homegrown, no soy. See the grisly acts of passion just as they happened. See the basement where Angeline buried her lovers. I came here for the weekend, and I met this local girl. Name's Michel. Blond, blue-eyed, about 5'6." She's got this terrific tattoo right behind her right shoulder. It's a blue parrot, and I wanna get one just like it. I think she said she got it at your place. You don't do parrots. Know any place that does? Thanks anyway. - Freeze, motherfucker! - Lieutenant Hall... We're police. Someone's been on my tail. What'd he look like? I didn't see him. - You saw somebody you didn't see? - You're a comedian. No, you're the comedian. This is my town. You check with me before you piss in my streets. Make house calls like you're somebody. Deveneux filed a complaint. - Bullshit. - He's got a witness. Fucking bullshit! I'm not fucking around! You cross me, and I'll grease a pole that slides you into a tub of shit. Somebody guts my partner, and you're thinking nasty things about me. I'm sorry about your partner. But I want you out of here tomorrow. Get him out of here. Algiers? Where's that? You're on a plane tomorrow morning, Jillette. That's tomorrow. Across the bridge. Look, you go asking questions in Algiers... ...they'll cut your tongue out and throw it in the river. Thanks. Not really. Anybody speak English here? I'm looking for Cara Jones. Do you know her? Cara Jones. A black girl. Where is she? Where is who? Michel. I don't know no Michel. I don't know anything. - Day or night? - What? Is it day or night? Night. See, you do know something. Don't ever lie to me again. You a tough guy? Tough enough. Michel here tonight? Who wants to know? A friend. I doubt it. You remember me? I just read you your rights. You're under arrest, lady. This is what's gonna happen. You and I are gonna walk out of this joint... ...you're gonna keep your fat mouth shut. You got it. Huh? Move. Jillette. - Eddie Jillette. - What? Eddie Jillette. Say it. Eddie Jillette. You say anything else, you're history. You shoot, they'll kill you. Think I give a shit about dying? Go! Move! Run! Don't even think about it! Move over there! Move! Move! Come on! Move it! Stop the car! Stop the goddamn car. Get out! Get out of the car. Move it. Get in. Shit. Get your head down. Keep it down. I'll tell you when to die. - Got a light? - Yeah. Went in right here. He's gone, man. He's gone. Michel? Where are you? Not a word, or you go under. Nothing. Call to me. Try him. He thinks you're his prisoner. Jillette. Eddie Jillette. Sure, I know your name. I'll make you a deal... ...Eddie Jillette. Let Michel go. You don't want her. You want me. Come out. Face me. Just the two of us. You kill me... ...you go home... ...safe. I guarantee. But... ...if you make me come after you... ...you die, for sure... ...like an animal. Like your friend. I cut him open... ...Eddie Jillette. Like a pig. Losado! Losado! Kick. You wanna live, start kicking. Michel. I swear, I didn't say nothing. You talked to him. No. Yes, my friend. Sorry to end your beauty sleep, lady. You know where we are? How far did we drift? How should I know? Jesus Christ! I can't stand these anymore. Help me get them off. You're tough. Why don't you gnaw it off? Give me the key. I can't go anywhere. Give me the key. I wish I could. I lost it in the river. I've got to get them off. They won't get off. - I can't stand it! - You're gonna hurt yourself. Get them off! I've gotta get away from you! Hold it! You're gonna hurt yourself! Now shut up! Damn boat! Stupid idiot. You shut the fuck up! Well, you lead the way, okay? And after you die, I have a dead man hanging on my arm! Look! Listen to me. When I die, it'll be on Chicago concrete. You got it? - Now, fucking move. - Let go. Walk! Stop! You're hurting me. I wanna know what happened. I wanna know why you and your boyfriend set up Deveneux. And what you get for killing a man. I wanna know how you killed my partner. - Who's your boyfriend? - He's not my boyfriend. - Who is he then? - He runs Algiers. Runs Algiers? What the hell is that? I belong to him. No shit. What does that mean? What do you think? I think it means Losado got himself a two-bit hooker. When I was 13, Mama took me to Losado. He gave her a house and some money. And I was his. I was given to him. Every hooker's got a hard-luck story. That's a real prizewinner, that one. I don't care if you don't believe me. You don't matter! Wrong. I matter a whole lot, lady. You're going to jail, and your boyfriend's gonna die. What are you doing? Can't you read? Nothing. Not a crumb. Come on. Great! What is it? You never had crawfish before? Sure, my mom used to put them in my lunch. No, not like that. Like that. See, you take them, and you break the head off. You suck the juice out of it. Good? Yeah, it's good. Do you have a wife? Yeah, ex. Ran off with some guy. What'd you do? - What do you mean? - Well, did you go after him? She just left me, that's it. That's all there was. What's so funny? You're a tough guy, a cop. And you didn't do anything? All right, what happened? She calls me up and says, "Eddie... ...I think if you and David sat down and had a beer... ...you'd really like each other. " So you took him out for a beer? Yeah, I really nailed him. Stuck him with the tab. You're not from there. You wouldn't understand. Don't get excited now. It's like rain somewhere. Somewhere pretty. God, I wish I was far away. Forget. Just forget. Yeah, let's forget. You're good, lady. You are... ...really, really good. This how you played it with that dumb, dead jerk in Chicago? Deveneux? Give some guy a hard-on. Next thing, he's getting killed for you. A whore's a whore. Goes with the territory. You don't know me. You don't know anything about my life. You don't know anything about my life. I do know one thing. Joey Collins is dead because of you. And you stood there, and you just watched, didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't you? You don't know what I've seen in my life. Do you think that was the worst? You think that was the worst? You wanna hear something about it? Do you? Losado will kill you. That's what I'm gonna watch. I'm not a whore. What? I'm not a whore. I've never been with anyone except Losado. Yeah, so? I'm not a whore. I'm a police officer. Understand me? Police officer? A cop? This is my prisoner. Cop. What are you saying to them? Keep your mouth shut. Do you speak any English at all? This woman's under arrest. She's my prisoner. Don't touch her. Take your fucking hands off her! Keep your fucking hands off her! Losado! Losado! That's right! This is Losado's woman! - Losado? - Losado. You understand that? He'll cut your hand off and scratch your ass with it if you touch her. Losado? Yeah! Losado! Back off! They called Losado. - This his operation? - Yes. He works for him? Deveneux? He smuggles them in and sells them to Deveneux. Is that it? Deveneux got greedy? Is that why they whacked him? Why did you help me? Why did you say Losado's name? Tub of shit. Turn your head. Come on. Get in! No, you don't! I don't get it. Losado's in business with Deveneux. Smuggles in cheap labour. What were you doing with Deveneux in Chicago? And why did he want to kill Losado? He said it was the only way. Deveneux promised to help me. Help you do what? Get free from Losado. What did you promise him? I didn't promise him anything. He was a gentleman. Jesus Christ, this whole thing's about you, isn't it? Get out. Don't move. Don't even think about it. Give it up. - Police officer. - Yeah, and I'm Tinkerbell, asshole. Handcuffs. Keep still. Jesus Christ! The next time you send someone here... ...advise them to exhibit a better sense of professionalism and respect. I don't know what you do in Chicago, and I don't care... ...but it doesn't work down here. Cop to cop, your boy has drowned in his own puddle of mud... ...if you get my meaning. I want to know why he's in this piss-stained rat cage. They're still pissed about the war. Listen here, boy! Cop to cop... ...I want this man out of here. I want him showered, shaved and polished up like it's payday... ...and the street is filled with ladies that can't say no. You get my meaning? Do it. You come here, lose your gun, your star and your pants. Got the girl. With you, there's always a girl. You better get it together, Jillette. If they have their way, you'll be maggotshit... ...turning big rocks into little ones. They got the decks marked and wired. Life cheats, Jillette. Oh, you're a treasure, Stemkowski. - That's what your ex-wife says. - My ex? If you want out of here, keep your mouth shut. I have Ms. Duval's sworn affidavit... ...that she did in fact meet Mr. Jillette in Chicago. That he presented himself as an assassin for hire. That he went off with my cousin Paul... ...and that Detective Collins went out of the hotel by himself. Since you have no evidence placing Miss Duval at the hotel... ...I suggest you drop criminal proceedings against her. I understand she's a witness against a Mr. Losado. She maintains she didn't see anything. Ask her. Thank you for your summary. The Chicago Police apologizes for any inconvenience we caused this woman. When a fellow officer is murdered... ...we go to extraordinary lengths to pursue the slightest lead. I received word from Chicago that we apprehended a prime suspect. We need Detective Jillette back to identify him. This man came into my home. He threatened me. He frightened my family. - He destroyed my car. - We've already paid for the car. You're missing my point. He's dangerously unstable. He has no business being a police officer. And I'm gonna see he's put away. He abducted this woman. He threatened to kill her. Ask her. What happened between this man and me doesn't concern you or the law. Sign this, please, so I can get rid of these guys. My client can't read. Thank you. You're free to go. Don't let her out of your sight. I don't wanna see either of you guys... The plane leaves in five minutes. I don't particularly like you, Jillette. I don't wanna hold hands, walk in the moonlight... ...and I don't wanna swap spit. I want that son of a bitch Losado. What the hell? Lawrence! Don't forget. I'm very unstable. I'm a lawyer. I had to say that. Guys like you... ...always think you can walk away from things like this, don't you? Look, can we talk about this? I don't care about you. I want Losado. - I understand that. - Do you fucking understand? You're right. I don't understand. Kiss it goodbye. Please, no! I'll be in Algiers. You tell Losado. Second floor. If you want a guest towel, it's an extra $10. - Lf anybody... - I never seen you. Wrong. If anybody asks for Eddie Jillette, tell them I'm upstairs. Who else is staying here? Well, at the moment... I'm taking all the rooms. There's no future in the job. Go home. It's still $10 for the extra towel. He's not out there. He won't come for you. He's in the bayou tonight. He'll come for me. And that's what you want, isn't it? Yes. If you wanna die so bad... ...why don't you put that gun to your head? Go on. I didn't come here to die. Eddie, go. Go. You can still get out of here. You can get out right now. I can't leave. Please, Eddie. It's all right. Say it. Say it. Say my name. Say Michel. Michel. - Say it. - Michel. - Say it. - Michel, Michel, Michel. Did you love her? Who? Your wife. You ask an awful lot of questions. - Too many? - Maybe. Did you? Yes. Do you still? Are you a cop? I'm sorry. It's okay. What are you thinking? How things fade, finally. Do they? Or do you just learn to live with them? You know, my mama's house was old and noisy like this. I used to think it sounded like voices. Stop. Right there. Shift your weight. Okay, take a step to your right. Okay, good. Right there. What kind of house did you live in? Like, when you were little. No houses. Apartments. All of them dumps. Take another step. - When I was little... - Okay, good. ...my mama used to put a drop of perfume in a glass of water. Then she said, " Michel, now drink this right up... ...it'll make you feel pretty inside. " That's it. Good. Don't. It's him. Michel, listen to me. I want you to go. He'll be here soon. I want you out of here when he comes. No, I'm staying with you. No, you're not. You're leaving. I want you to get as far away from this stinking shithole as you can. Whatever went down in Chicago's got nothing to do with you. It's over. You're free. Michel, go on. This is your chance. Get out of here. You have to talk to me. You have to talk to me right now. We've got time. We haven't talked or anything. Just talk to me. Just for a while. You want to help me? Please get out of here. I won't let him kill you. Together, we have a chance. That's all I want. I love you. I want time... - I don't care about you! - I want you. Get the fuck out! You couldn't stop this, could you? Then what good are you, my friend? He's a dead man, Michel. For you. All for you. Don't come any closer unless you're willing to die with him. Let him live... ...and I'll come with you, like before. For good. I always give you what you want, no? Come. Show him that you belong to me. Come. You'll die, my friend! You'll die! Oh, yes. You'll burn, my friend. You see that, shithead? I got a one-bedroom apartment. I don't cook. I've got a colour TV. I forget to do things: Anniversaries, birthdays... ...Christmas. When I'm on a job, I'm gone for days. You understand? I get drunk. I yell at the people I love. So what do you say? What do you say?
