Hey, Mom, I'm a pirate today. Well, honey, you could be. Should I have an eye patch, or a parrot, or a hook, or-- Get your plate, you're going to eat something. [sigh] Get in there. Whoa, do it. Go on. Be still. Go on, get in there. Your silage holding up OK? MR. MCKIBBEN: Going through it too fast. How's that new growth enhancer? Packed on more than 15 pounds this last week. Yeah, they lick that stuff up. Yeah. I could cut you a better price with the enhancer if you want to do six months of antibiotic system. The system includes injectables and antibiotics for your feed. You mix it in with your feed, you don't have to treat just one hog at a time. MR. MCKIBBEN: Good stuff. My pleasure, Mr. McKibbin. I'm going to have to check with my rep on the pricing. I can come in lower. I appreciate you coming out. All right, I'll follow up with you next week. Can't make you any promises. Sure, I understand. [car approaching] MAN (IN CAR): (YELLING) Freak. [man's voice on radio] Bye, Stephen. Real kind of you to keep an eye on him, Stephen. No, nothing, ma'am. Sam is my friend. Halloween carnival is coming-- You gonna be keeping the peace, Sheriff? With my star and my hat. Well, we're counting on you to maintain order. Flawless out there. All right, well, thank you, sweetheart. Bye, Stephen. STEPHEN: Bye. Sam, sit down. Bye-- bye, Sam. SAM: If a word starts with R or N or D, you say like iratepas for pirate. You get it? Esoys airboys. That's good, Mom. Thanks. So bullfighter or pirate? Better decide, it's going to take time to make it. [music playing] Dicofol, terbacil, topramezone, glyphosate 2, 4-D, dicamba-- Dicamba. Norflurazon. Morphozon. Increase. Increase. Glyphosate, topramezone. Increase. Air, what 'chu got on there? My Allzack pack balls. What about this one? It's not easy making your own way. You finish that application? Come on, we made a plan. Kid that gave you that shiner, be working for you someday. SAM: Permission to board. We're talking, Sam. SAM: Permission granted. Your dad and I never had a chance to go to college, Finn. SAM: Jackson, falling to kill. You know, what you're saying right now-- Ow. ...doesn't make any sense. So shutas itas. You gonna draw bees for a living? You think some BS degree in ag science is gonna make a difference? [bees buzzing] My granddad used to keep bees. I'd run around the clover patch while he worked. That smell, I never forget. Honey is what you're here for? Pardon me, Betty, I-- I feel I know you. You're with Gigas? Huh, yeah. That's a great set up you got here. We like it. Come by to see Frank. He's on a run. Oh, that's good. Any run's a good one. Look, I know you all been having some trouble with your accounts. Keep our overhead low, we'll ride it out. Keep your inventory in the barn? Well, like I told Frank, this would make a perfect place for Gigas to set up another warehouse. Well, I'm sure you'll find something. Yeah. You got other work you need to get on to, I don't want to keep you from-- Well, you have Frank give me a call. Best of luck with everything. I don't have any homework. Swear it. Not a minute after 5 o'clock. Keep this side of the river, and stay out of the water. SAM: I heard you. Haven't seen Elena at school. We go home after the harvest and so she start again there. Good for her, a little extra vacation time. [man's voice on police radio] Afternoon, Silas. SILAS: Hey, Betty, how are you and Frank? We're perfect, thanks. Tomatoes are ripe, just out of the field. Time for canning. Just yesterday it was spring. Special bargain today. For you? Follow me. So far it is for me. Look at that. Now I got to get a rock. [speaking spanish] Hands up, sissy. Looks like you don't have any hands, huh? Come on, put your hands up. Ha, put your hands up. Bang, bang, bang, bang. Oh, you're hungry? Oh, I'm starving. No, no. Get off. Get off of me. [laughter] We haven't done anything like this since-- Since we used to tear through McKibbin's cornfields with a six pack and a hard-on. And you're just the same. Same old you. Frank. You look just the same. Someone from Gigas came out to the to house today looking for you. Gigas-- He knew my name. ...is an animal marking territory. [laughter] [music playing] [music playing on radio] [dog barking] Thought you were on a run? [exhale] Just took Sam to school. Family? Stubborn. He sees things the way he wants, not how they are. Like you. Give me those papers. You're sweating through your shirt. Seems like you've been home more than you've been out. I'll go up to the house and change. No deliveries? I could go through those, you know, I could-- No, no, I got it. Follow 'em. I said no. All right. You want some coffee? Sure. Push me, Mom. I'm going to see if Fin's done with his shift. You should go on in over to the fabric and pick out something for your costume. Something red and black. Red and black, right? Mhm. What about the eye patch? Make that at home. Sword? I think sword's the best part. We'll do it together. Oh, hey, I'm Finley. I'm in ladies underwear. Can I help you? My, how you've grown. Get that thing off before someone sees you. What do you think about me going as like a transgender vampire for Halloween? Think your father's right. If you spend as much energy trying to fit in as you do trying to stick out, you'd be a lot happier. Everyone's the same around here. Fin, that's not fair. You're right. There are guys who wear Carhartts, drive trucks, and smoke cigarettes and then there are guys who wear Carhartts, drive trucks, and shoot a bad cow. Very clever. Hello, Mrs. Freeman, hello. Hi, Stephen. Where's Sam? Where's Sam? Oh, he's, ah, he's somewhere. I'll go find Sam. That boy is everywhere. OK, open your fist. Why don't you just go as yourself? Or you could go as a mean older brother. Then we won't need any costumes. Or I could go as a bullfighter. Well, you have to make up your own mind. Come on, boys. Let's clear up the table. For Paula, for pretty Paula, for P-- Shut it. You keep him and hawing, there's not got going to be time to make anything for Halloween. SAM: You could go as Paula. Paula. Your girlfriend Paula. Shut it. There's my boy. Hey. Hi, Finley. Fin, would you go check your brother, make sure he's getting ready for bed? Can't he do anything by himself? BETTY: Finley, get. K. Well, uh, I'll- I'll see you at work. You will catch me at work. BETTY: Paula. What? He makes me feel better. [chuckle] MAN (ON RADIO): Did it grow? Last summer's drought was a killer for retail food prices. We talk a lot of about consumers, but the farmer-- [dog barking] SAM: Off with your head. Can't believe you were sleeping with all that light in your eyes. Made up my mind. Of course you have. I'm going to Scratch's with you. Don't you want to be home with the boys? Oh, they're fine. They're sick of me. I want to start working again. I don't want you around it. I've seen the papers. Papers, barn. Frank. We have time. [music playing on radio] Hey, Fin. Hey, Paula. [inaudible]. Yeah. Here, give that to me. Thanks. Thanks for the car. Good luck. All right. It's nice to meet you. Morning, guys. Hey, Jimmy. Got the atrazine to the crop duster. Uh, where's Scratch at? Out with the birds. Oh, you go see Scratch and I'm going to unload. Been a few years since you've been out here. You're getting a little bony for my taste. Well, I ain't one of your sows, Scratch. Well, it's not daddy's farm anymore. Mm-mm. We're doing too much, to be honest. I can hardly keep things straight. We should, uh, we should set up a regular shipment. Frank and I have things worked out. Well, that way you don't even have to think about it. We moved on from on just feeding seed. We stock or can stock almost every medication, antibiotics, hormone, herbicide, you name it that you've used. She's excited. Hadn't been out in a while. Well, we should be supplying you with most of your stuff like we used to. Gigas sells me my feed same as you did and they unload my products. I get what I need, doesn't get easier. They're squeezing you. They're squeezing you too. You might as well be a tenant farmer. At least I'm still in the black. Scratch, we need the work. Like I told Frank, I got a little job you could do for me. I've been using every bit of persuasion and charm I have-- You think we're just going to wish our problems away? ...to keep Scratch and every other client we still got. [bell ringing] BETTY: What was that job Scratch was talking about? FRANK: It's not on the up and up. BETTY: Why would he come to us with something illegal? And then think that we would do something like that? Margins are tight, some people are willing to bend. [children yelling] I'm close with McKibbin. How much is the system worth? Phew, more than 10 house payments. He was impressed, he was real impressed when I talked him through it. He said he just had to run the numbers. There he is. ELENA: 'Course I'll do it. Ickentas. I'm not a chicken. [speaking spanish] No, you get in. You don't know how to swim? 'Course I do. Eat it. No. Put it in your mouth. Ew. Chicken. ELENA: Chicken. Thought you might have some questions about the system. Oh, your demo was very thorough. Well, I'd love to go over it again with you, Mr. McKibbin. Oh, that's all right. All right, you ready to write that check then? Come on, Frank. You know the deal. Oh, I'm giving it to you at nearly cost. I can't do any better. I buy the system from Gigas, they buy my home. I need this one. It's just the way it is. [child shouting] Indian summer. Close your eyes. Come on. Close 'em. Let's see now. Does-- does it go in here? No? OK, maybe it goes in here. Stop. Does it go here? 500? Down payment on the system from McKibbin. It's a done deal. Frank. [exhale] You gonna finish that in time? That don't look like a pirate vest. Looks more frontier boy. I'm gonna whip you, you keep that up. Looks like it's moving or something. Yeah? It's good. Thanks. FRANK: But it's not real. I ought to make you come out with me some time. You need to see what it's like to get your hands dirty. You're right. There's a real future for me in the family business. I want that tech school application in my hands tomorrow. You got me? Boy thinks he's too good for the real world. [knocking] Finley, open up. He-- we were raised thinking that-- You don't have to excuses for him. You both worried about a lot of things. I'm not stupid. Why don't you teach me how to use your pipe? What? I just thought that we stop pretending. I won't tell your dad. It's a bong, not a pipe. And it's some pretty strong stuff. Well, let's fire it up. OK, don't be a dork, Mom. Right. Here, hold this. OK. We should probably go out here. Out there? Yeah, out here. OK. Exhale. [dog barking] Whoa. Whoa. What? BETTY: Did you see that? That bright-- it's a purple streak. Mom. [laughter] What? [laughter] I applied. You were just yanking his chain? [laughter] FINLEY: Few months ago. I applied to the Art Institute in New York. New York? Like not the AG science? I showed one of the professors my portfolio. BETTY: How-- your portfolio? My drawings. You want to go? If they want me. You only have to do one thing. What? Make yourself happy. [music playing] [men's voices in background] FRANK: If you could tell me who it is that sells, so I can-- come on, Ed. Who is it? ED: I can't. You know that, Frank. I know, but-- FRANK: You told us that you could help-- Morning. Well? An offer's been made on the place. Well, we just made a payment. Ah-- Frank? The bank has tried to work with you on this, but we have an offer on the property outright. We need the back payments on the house. Morning, Finley. Mr. Kroger. Sam. Go on. Fin, get Sam in the truck. Go on. I'm sorry to catch you with the boys. Oh, no. No-- no trouble at all, Ed. Well, we have a big sale coming in, Ed. Right, Frank? That's right. Right. In order to retain ownership of the property, we need it. Now. I can give you till the end of the week. It's Gigas, isn't it? That man from Gigas? Yeah. I wish it were in my hands. Forgive me. Ed? Halloween's end of the week. How am I going to finish the costume? Dad? Dad? Dad? Frank? Yeah, no, no, I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. What happened? No, no, I just-- I need to, uh-- I just need to close my eyes for a moment. [grunts] How you feeling? Ah, I can't get comfortable. Need anything? Come to bed. I'm freezing. Sale to McKibbin gonna be enough? I need to give him a little more time. Uh-- Scratch has some kind of problems with one of his dairy cows. I'll go see if I can wrangle something over there tomorrow. I want you to get some rest. [cows mooing] BETTY: You've got to leave them on increase, a hormone. SCRATCH: All of 'em? More productive but hell of a lot less durable. BETTY: Fecal worm on this one. I've got an antibiotic that'll get rid of this infection before you can say Jesus. My Gigas rep said I'd send him to slaughter. Well, it hasn't gone systemic. He would only know that by looking at her. You don't feel right, but she'll be fine. Just make sure to keep them separated, OK? The healthy from the sick. Everything they got goes into making that milk. Well, Frank and I have a good supply of that antibiotic. My rep will have it out by Mon-- I can have it to you within the hour, not even charging you to bring a vet out here. I can't afford to lose any of my stock, but I can't lose my contract with Gigas neither. BETTY: If you're worried about money then you should stop your increase injections for a time. It'll be a waste because you're gonna have to throw this milk out. SCRATCH: No, my rep didn't say anything-- Well, they don't want you throwing out your milk, even if it is tainted. Each day their treated with an antibiotic, you need to discard your milk for 36 hours. That's roughly 10 days worth of milk that you're going to have to throw out. Probably some sort of contamination in your lines, you're gonna have to clean out all this equipment. But your supplier can tell you that. I'll have some trucks out later today to pick up your milk, shouldn't affect your output. BETTY: No one will know, so why worry? We all have to be a little bit flexible to keep working. Course, you wouldn't think twice about taking that milk to market. SCRATCH: Let me walk the lady out. Give me the sale, Scratch. I was here first and I can get you that drug now. You know I can't do that. You're gonna unload all this milk, I get 20 more loads like this one going out today. He's not going to rest until my boys are begging in the street. I got inspectors coming out. I came across some old stuff in one of the barns. I need someone to dispose of it. I can't do it officially. You know how much it'd put me in the hole. I need someone I trust, someone I know. I can't have it coming back on me. What is it? More than likely something you and Frank sold me a while back. Same damn stuff we're using right now, but an hour past it's expiration. I can't afford any fines, getting shut down even for a day. What? You got some kind of a problem? You sell this stuff, Betty. This is what you do. I mean, don't go getting all knotted up about it. It all ends up in the water table anyhow. Not by my hands. That's right. It was legal when you sold it to me. I trust you, girl. The money is good. It's real good. Do me a favor and I can find you some work, real work. Maybe we'll talk about setting up regular shipments for the crop duster. Think about that. BETTY: Sam? Sam? [phone ringing] [music playing] [car honking] [man's voice in background] SAM: Mom. OK. OK. BETTY: Paco? [speaking spanish] What happened? I don't know. OK. Come on, come on. Sometimes, when she's playing, she has trouble breathing. Can I help? OK, Elena. Get in the truck. Ow, Mom. What were you doing? You think that you can just take off, go wherever you please? DOCTOR: I've looked over the results. We have run all the tests. I know this is tough. There are standard courses of treatment and there are newer experimental ones that are primarily hormone therapies that we can try on you. They tend to be well tolerated, although there are side effects with either type of treatment course you decide on. And there are other medications I can put you on if the side effects get to a point where they're causing you too much discomfort. 'Course, with either treatment, there will be out of pocket cost that you will-- Why aren't you saying anything? Yeah, they took some blood. It's fine. And-- and the boys, we'll just-- we'll just-- we'll have to be there for them. We will. We will. All right? Get someone, Frank. I can't do this alone. Doctor wants a few more tests. They'll come back clear anyway. It's a waste of money. Right, honey? We'll get those tests. We'll pay for 'em. Money comes in from McKibbin, I'll do it then. I'll go see him tomorrow. Heh, no. I need to deal with him. Just give me a few days. Finley? What happened? Fin? Is it bleeding bad? Got in. Got in? College? Don't tell Dad, please. I'm in awe of you, Fin. Even if I got a scholarship, we'd still have to pay for something. We could never really afford it. I want this. Fin? I want this for you. I'll wait a year, see if things get better. Another year's not going to make a difference. BETTY: You can't stay here, Fin. I'll be OK. Hey, Betty. Hey, I see you're all set for Halloween. Yeah. You know, you kind of caught me in the middle of supper. I'm sorry about that. It's just, ah-- you paid the deposit and I don't mean to pressure you, but we need the rest of the money. What? The balance on the delivery system? That was a loan. You wrote Frank a check, a deposit. I think you should talk to your husband about this. I need the rest of the money and then I can go. Look. I don't expect Frank's ever going to pay me back, but I just can't give you anymore. I'm not running a charity. Go home, Betty. [door closing] [music playing] OK, put that in. Where's Frank? On a run. How are you gonna manage on your own? He'll give me a hand later. Sure wish I had a black briefcase to put that in. This band's just the same. You should wear gloves, maybe a mask. Couldn't be that bad. Like you said, it's probably stuff that you bought from us anyhow. It'll be fine, long as it's diluted. 'Course it will. Make sure you bring those jugs back. That didn't come out right. This is half. The other half when you bring the empties back. I got to make sure this comes out right, you understand. No, you never said anything-- I need the money now, Scratch. All of it. You'll get your money. What about the regular shipments? You do this job, you do it right, and there's more where that came from. Good girl. [music playing] WOMAN: Betty? Betty? Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Where you been? Are you scared? Very. Still fits. I'm not going as the same thing. Well, you don't have to. Show it me, I want to see it. FRANK: Sam, cut it out. BETTY: You'll have your costume, babe. Fin, I want to talk to your dad. FRANK: (IN MONSTER VOICE) ROAR. Let's do this thing for Scratch. (IN MONSTER VOICE) Put it out of your mind, Betty. It's probably something that we sold him. (IN MONSTER VOICE) I be your friend. You be my bride. You be my bride. Hey. Oh, remember these? Come on, you always get wild when you wear these. Put 'em on. Come on, just for a minute. Don't. FRANK: Just-- oh, come on, pussy, pussy, pussy. BETTY: Frank. FRANK: Come on. Oh, come on. What about the tests? We do this thing right for Scratch, he's got more work for us. This isn't what we do. How're you gonna pay the bank? We'll find another way. I need you to open your eyes, baby. We've got everything we need. People lose their homes, their kids don't go to college, they survive it. They survive it. I don't want anything to do with this thing from Scratch. Whatever he's got, we're not going to be a part-- We're already in it, Frank. This is what we do. Why do I feel so bad? Because you're just better than the rest of us, Frank. Everything you do is like planting a seed. Seed's gonna grow, gonna become something else in your life. Hey. Come in. It's nice. Field hands used to have-- well, it's lovely how you've done it up. Excuse me. [voices on tv] ELENA: [speaking spanish] PACO: [speaking spanish] ELENA: [speaking spanish] PACO: [speaking spanish] How's she feeling? Better, I think. It's difficult raising her here alone. Yes. Must be. Elena's sick. You can talk to me. She has asthma, allergies. But why now? I need help too. I can pay you. Take her to a good doctor, get her the medications that she needs. Can I have a drink of water? No one will know. [thunder] I wanna know what it is. Some sort of herbicide or pesticide. I mean, it's expired. That's all. You work with the stuff in the fields. We have certain standards, regulations. It just cost too much to do it officially. This is not for me. Keep it. Please. (WHISPERING) Fin? Did I miss a day? Is it Halloween yet? Almost. What do you wanna do now? Smoke? Fin, I need your help. OK. OK. [grunts] Put some leaves over the top. Why don't you put 'em in the barn? Uh, your father. It's high, moving at a good lick, let the current take it away. It's the middle of the night, Fin. There's no one here. Is this about me? It'll stay hidden here. All right? What's in these, Mom? I know you're scared. BETTY: Carnival's tonight. You should get more rest. I'm scared too. I'm going to go see Ed Kroger. I'm going to tell him that I need to go to the doctor. He has to give us more time. The bank has to give us more time. BOTH: (SINGING) Ghosts may walk, skeletons talk. Halloween, strange things seem-- We need to get rid of those drums. I don't want you getting-- I took care of it. I asked him to get rid of 'em. He did it? He's taking care of it. [engine roaring] Hey, you taking Elena to the Halloween carnival? I don't think so, no. Is she feeling all right? Yeah. It's a gift. Sam, come on. I don't want you to be late for your Halloween party. Fin, put that out. What is with you? SAM: Wait. Sam, right this minute. What are you doing, Bear? I'm not going as a robot. OK, come here. You'll be a pirate, OK? Where's your costume? Don't have one. Aw. Hey, I've been going as Frankenstein for as long as-- yeah, I don't even know how long and that's-- a long time and everybody always loves it. I'm sure your mother would let you borrow her cat suit. I'm a kid, you're a dad. Nobody cares what you're dressed up as. Get some food in your belly. Don't worry, Sam. There be smooth waters ahead, matey. I didn't forget you, Bear. FRANK: You thank your mother. It's OK. You thank your mother. Put that thing on right now. Leave him be. FRANK: Put that thing on right now. Wanted to make it with you, Mom. You know the whole town's going to be there and you're going to be stuck in your room. [door slamming] You should go on ahead without us. Carnival's already started. What? It's already started. The whole town's already there. Betty? [music playing] [crowd chatter] [voices on tv in background] FRANK: Don't even think about coming out of your room, Sam. [grunt] [music playing] Hey, Finley, where's-- where's Sam? Hey, stick 'em up, partner. PACO: Elena? Elena? Elena? You're big enough to leave home. You must be brave enough to swim in the water. That has nothing to do with anything. Wah-wah, I want my mommy. I'm a scared little chicken. At least I have a mom. Don't leave. Come on. I'm getting in. [coughing] This is the sheriff speaking. You are under arrest. You-- you are breaking the law. This is the sheriff speaking. You are under arrest. You are under arrest. Run, they're on to us. STEPHEN: You are under arrest. Sam-- Sam, it's-- Wait, it's Stephen. Wait. Sam, it's me. It's Stephen. [coughing] SAM: Dad, I'm sorry. It's not their fault. He was in his room. What'd you do to him? I found him in the woods. He was in the river. No, no, no, no. Get him a blanket. Are you all right? Did you swallow any water? No. Did you swallow any water? No, I don't think so. We should take him to the hospital. FRANK: Jesus, Betty, let's just get him upstairs. No. Get into some warm clothes, all right? -It's fine. That could've been Elena in the water. I just thank god it wasn't. FRANK: Your daughter's outside waiting. [door closing] What are you doing? Talk to me. Wait, put that down. It's Betty Freeman. Tell Sheriff Silas something's happened, something's in the creek about a quarter mile downstream of us. You need to send someone now. Where's Finley? He's at the carnival. Right? [MAN'S VOICE ON POLICE RADIO IN BACKGROUND] Finley? Finley? Stephen, it's Stephen. Tell me you don't have anything to do with this. Thank god you called, Betty. He's got burns all over his body. Probably some of the kids. There's always something on Halloween. [crying] [music playing]
