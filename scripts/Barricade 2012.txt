We should take them there, give them their first white Christmas. - You think it's still there? - Yeah. Place was built like a brick you-know-what. Shit house? Why, when I say you-know-what... ...you feel compelled to fill in the blanks? - Because I know it makes you crazy. - Yes, it makes me crazy. Looks inviting. I'm gonna need contact with my patients. It's in the middle of nowhere. And that's what makes it great. Besides, you could use some contact with your kids. That's the third time you've made a crack like that in the last few weeks. - Just making sure that you heard me. - Sweetheart, I'm not 12. You know, I get it. It's just-- I try, but work is insane. I've got all those new patients. And I just... I know. Look, kids are your strong suit, mine's paying the bills. That's the plan. That was always the plan. Remember? You're better at that. You're better at everything. - You're better at playing baseball. - That's crap. Besides, taking care of the kids... ...takes a lot less energy and time than you think it does. You make it look easy. Here it is, guys. - It doesn't even look open. - Yeah? Well, it's supposed to be. Okay, 9'~lY5- - I'm just gonna get the keys to the cabin. - Dad, it's spooky out here. - I think it's kind of cool. - Yeah, it is kind of cool. And kind of spooky. Wait here. Hello? Mr. Howes? Hello? Hello? - What do you want? - God, man. - You scared the hell out of me. - Oh, I'm sorry about that. - Are you Mr. Howes? - Sheriff Howes, actually. Oh, I'm Terrance Shade. Leah Tyler's husband. It's nice to finally meet you. I was so sorry to hear about your loss. I remember her. She was just the sweetest little child. My wife and I both loved her very much. - May God rest them both. - Thank you. I was expecting you earlier. I thought I had my days mixed up. I know. Sorry. Took me longer than I thought to get the kids organized. Not a problem. I got the keys to the cabin inside. Well, come on. Well, here's the cabin keys. I closed the station early because there wasn't much going on. That's some cough you got. You okay? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just getting over a little thing. - Everything's ready? - I got everything you wanted. Enough for a week, easy. Lots of ice, mac and cheese, candy, decorations. The fridge upstairs is on the fritz... ...but the freezer down in the basement is stocked full. - Great. - It's beautiful up there. Your kids are gonna have fun. Just like their mom did. Yeah, she really lit up when she talked about this place. She used to run up and down those aisles looking for candy. I can see her in those two. Come on, you guys. You got plenty. Let's go. Jake. He)'- Well, now. - What's this guy's name? - Jack the Ripper. - Sweet. - Thanks. Appreciate it. Oh, no. It's free candy day. You're in luck. It's free candy day. - Supposed to snow like hell. - Snow, huh? That's good for snowmen and all that good snow stuff. - Absolutely essential. - Come on, you guys. - Thanks, Mr. Howes. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Thanks, sheriff. Dad? How come you don't have any pictures of Mom? Sure I do. Where? I never see them. Don't you think about her any more? Sweetheart, I will always think about your mom. Sometimes it's hard for people to keep things... ...that remind them of someone who's gone. Sometimes, they just wanna make it through the day without feeling sad. You know what I mean? When you say "people," you mean you, right? Yeah. I mean me. I worry about forgetting. - Mom had such a great face. - Sweetheart, you won't. I guarantee it. - Are we there yet? - Not yet. Shit! Dad said the S-H word. You guys okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. Stay here. Wonderful. - Dad! - What? Are you all right? I'm all right. Are you all right? Fine. What was it? Just a squirrel. - That couldn't have been a squirrel. - No shit. Watch your mouth, Jake. - You said it, Dad. - Yeah, I was wrong to say it. But you say it all the time. - Jake, let it go. - Jake, let it go. When I'm a grown up can I say bad stuff? Sure, buddy. Hey, guys. So, what do you think? - No satellite dish? - I didn't ask. - What about cartoons? - Guys, we're gonna hike. We're gonna sled. We're gonna learn to ski. Have you ever done any of that stuff, Dad? - No I have not, but-- - They had better have a TV. It's called the great outdoors. All right? We're not gonna spend that much time inside the cabin. You might be right, Dad. Maybe we don't wanna spend much time in the cabin. Go in, Jake. Ladies first. Right, Dad? Come on. We'll all go in together. Cool. Dad, do you think it's real? Oh, no. I doubt it, honey. Totally real. Dad? What's in the box? I'm guessing tools. Mr. Howes must've left them when he came to set everything up. - Set what up? - Set what up? Well, that's funny you should ask. Merry Christmas, kiddos. Are there presents? Are there presents? Gee, I hadn't thought of that. - No way! - Thanks, Dad. Got more at home too. Figured this was enough to hold you over. - Can we open them? - No. We gotta make a fire, gotta make hot chocolate... ...get in the whole Christmas mood, right? Come on, let's look around. Bedrooms are upstairs. Three of them, supposedly. You guys pick the one you want. - No fighting. - Oldest picks first. Okay, then I'll pick. All right, we'll pick. No fighting. I promise. Excellent. I get the biggest bedroom and my own bathroom... ...because I am, obviously, the mostest awesomest dad on the planet. Yeah? Right? Nothing? All right. Stay with the tour. Dining room. Nice. You brought your tuxedo, right? A gentleman dresses for dinner. And this is the kitchen. Oh, man. - What are we gonna eat? - Oh, right. The fridge is on the fritz. Follow me. - I'm not that hungry, Dad. - Come on, you fraidycats. Behold a treasure chest of culinary delights. A what? For the master of the house, of course, hot dogs. For the lady, it looks like every mini-pizza in North America. What about you, Dad? Mac and cheese. You realize you're the only kids... ...that don't like mac and cheese, right? It's weird. - Tired, beaux? - No way. - Well, I am. Sorry, I'm bushed. - Please, Dad. - Come on. - Dad. But since we're in this most excellent cabin... ...and we have all this excellent food, including this weird ice cream... ...I say slumber party in the family room. Right? Come on. Hey, don't touch those gifts till I get there. We must fight to regain our freedom or everything is lost. Everything! Sweet dreams, love. ls there a way to stop from having nightmares, Mom? Think funny thoughts before you go to sleep. I tried that and then I had a dream about the killer clown guy with big feet. - With the orange hair that was on fire? - Yeah. - I remember. That was not funny. - No. Can't you fix it so I don't have nightmares any more? Well, that is a tough one... ...but how about we fix it with a kiss then see how that works? - I love you. - I love you too, Mom. - Night, buddy. - Night, Dad. Can you fix it so I don't have nightmares any more? Sure, just let me put on my Victoria's Secret tool belt. Your what? - What'd Dad break this time, Mom? - Nothing. And I am not the klutz you all make me out to be. Dad, you broke the hammer trying to fix the toaster. That was a very old hammer. Daddy may not be Mr. Fix-It, but he does pay for the tools. Gee, thank you. Thanks, Mom. Hey, Dad, it's snowing. - You slept for too long, Daddy. - I did? Holy crap. What time is it? Why didn't you wake me? We tried. What have you been doing all this time? Thanking God we have a TV. Boy, it's really coming down out there, huh? Does that mean we can't go out? No. It means Dad's glad we have a TV too. Aren't you, Dad? I guess we better get out there real quick... ...and make ourselves a snowman... ...before it piles up so high that we can't move. All in favor? Come on you, guys. Get your snow stuff on. That's why we brought it. Daddy? Yeah? What is it, sweetheart? Cyn? It's just the door to the attic, sweetheart. I think there's something up there. No. No, no. You're just letting your imagination run away with you. Go on. Get your stuff. - Dad! - Jake? - What's wrong? - There's something out there. What's the matter with you kids? We've all just gotta calm down. We're gonna make ourselves crazy. What are you seeing out there? Was it a bird? Bigger. In the trees. Like a person? I don't know for sure. Well, it's just shadows in the trees, buddy. Just... Just tree shadows blowing in the wind. - You feeling okay? - I'm fine. - I'm gonna nail Cynthia with a snowball. - Oh, yeah? Be careful. Your sister's got a heck of an arm. She's just a girl. So was your mom and she could throw a fastball like a big leaguer. It's harder than I thought. - Hey! - Gotcha. I gotcha. Jake! Help me get your sister! Boys against the girl! No, no, no. Kids against big people. This doesn't sound like fair teams. Traitors! Come on! Come on, bring it! Missed! Where's Jake? I don't know. Jake! He's hiding. - Jake! - Jake! Jake? Jake? Jake! Open the door! Jake! Jake! Open the door! Jake! Open the door, Jake! - Why did you lock the door? - I didn't. What is this place? If we need to fix anything, we've come to the right place. It's pretty cool, huh? But you don't know how to fix anything, Dad. - Says who? - Mom. She used to say you were good with your brain, not your hands. Oh, she did, huh? Cynthia? Jake, is that the same thing you saw? Okay. Change in plans. I think we're coming down with something. What do you say we head down... ...we find Mr. Howes and we ask about seeing a doctor? - Dad, I have to pee. - Of course, you do. Go on. Quickly, both of you. Okay? Quickly, You 9UY5- I love you. Hey. Hey- Okay. Guys? Guys! We gotta go! I'll start the car. My God. How could this happen already? Come on! Come on! Come on! Goddamn it! Hey, you guys. You know... ...looks like the car's pretty sick too. And... A little snowy. 80... What do you say... ...we go back inside, make a nice fire... ...some SOUP. All the good stuff Mom used to do. - Little cold never hurt anybody. Right? - Dad, I'm scared. Why did Mom want us to come here? - She thought it would be fun. - It's not fun, Dad. I know. But it will be. Come on! Come on. We'll have fun. Could we walk, Dad? To the doctor? - I think Jake's really sick. - We're miles from anywhere. We're knee deep in snow. We'd just make him worse. Besides, since when do you like to walk? Yeah, I do hate to walk. And there's nothing to be scared of here, right? Yeah, nothing scary here. All right. You know what I think? We toured the other day, but way too quickly. - Follow me. - Dad. What about upstairs under the beds? Could we check those too? Nothing to worry about under beds, buddy. Still, could you check? It's on my list. Daddy, what are we looking for? Nothing. Just making sure there's nothing to worry about. And there isn't. Come on. Come on. Under the bed too, Dad. Monsters don't hide under beds, Jake. That's an old wives' tale. Monsters don't hide anywhere because there are no monsters. That's a fact. Dad, we should keep checking. Yeah. No, I'm just taking a minute to catch my breath. I haven't had this much exercise in a long time. The air is thinner up here, I think. Nothing. Checked downstairs. Checked the bedrooms. I think it's time for a little lunch. What do you say? I'm hungry. How about you guys? Lunch? It's nighttime, Daddy. What's wrong with you? What? Of course, it is. But that doesn't matter. Peanut butter and jelly you can have anytime. Lunch, dinner. Right, Cyn? Can we check the bathroom? The... Right. Right. Check the bathroom. What happened in here? Did you guys...? Did one of you take Daddy's pills? - No. - Jake? Did you do this? Were you looking for something? No, Dad. You know how OCD he is. - He would've cleaned it up. - I didn't do anything. Jake? That's what we needed. Not Mom, but not bad. - It was good, Dad. Really. - Yeah, Dad. Really good. Better than Mom's. I can't remember one thing that your mother wasn't good at. Can you? She couldn't sing. Yeah. Of course, neither can I. Okay. House is locked up. Checked everywhere. We're safe and sound. Is it coming for us'? Why did you say that? Answer me, Jake. Why did you say that? - I don't know. - Why are you so afraid? Why are you acting so weird, Dad? I don't... I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry. I... The truth is Daddy doesn't really know what's going on. But... Nothing is coming for us, okay? - Dad, don't go! - But what if it's help? I wanna go home, Daddy, please. Listen, you guys. Listen to me. We can't hide, right? They know we're here. And we can't call the police. $0... - But that's just a lamp, Daddy. - I know. I know. But I don't have a lot of options in here. I'm liking the lamp right now. It's a good lamp. Heavy. - Stay here. - Daddy, let us come with you. Cynthia, listen to me. This is probably nothing. I need you to get under the bed now... ...and stay there until I come back. You understand me? Don't make a sound. Not one sound. Get under. Go. aHruaia I hope you don't mind my using this spare key... ...but nobody answered so I... Something wrong? Oh, my God. Am I glad to see you. Daddy? What's going on? - I really don't know. - But you're the dad. You have to know. You have to help us. I know. Buddy, I'm trying. I really am. I'm just... I'm not as good as Mom. Okay, okay. It's all right. It's all right. It's a blown circuit from the storm. - You're not leaving us again! - Stay with me. Come on. Come on. Stay with me. Daddy, this is one of those things a person should never do. Let's just don't go down there, okay? Come on. - Something smells funny, Dad. - It's wet here. Watch your step. Daddy, I'm not going any further. Please stop. Sweetheart, we have to get the lights back on. Wouldn't you feel better with the lights back on? Daddy, don't go, please. Let's get out of here. Please, Daddy. - Cool. - Yeah, well, apparently... ...your sister doesn't think so. Cynthia? It's okay. It's all right. The rats will stay down there. They got plenty to eat. Can it get in, Dad? Can it break in? No, absolutely not. I won't let that happen. Wasn't there duct tape in here before? There's not enough nails. - Don't go. - I have to. I have to make this house safe for us. To do that, there's things I need from the tool shed. Well, then we have to come. - No. It's too dangerous. - Not as dangerous as being alone. Come on. Come on. Come on. There was a shovel there. Look at this. Perfect. God, look at the size of these things. They're humongous. Nothing's getting past that. They're monster-proof. Totally. Dad. I think they're gone. Get over there. Go on. We've gotta go. Now! Go! - Dad! - Don't look back, Jake! Go on! As fast as you can! Daddy, don't leave me here. Dad! Your mother always said I was no good with a hammer. Look at me now. - Daddy? - Okay Okay, all right. This is where we sleep tonight. All right? All of us. Good. Come on. Let's brush our teeth. Come on, you guys. - What? - Nail the bathroom too, Dad. Oh, buddy, we're gonna need the bathroom. Besides, there's no windows in here. Nothing's gonna get in. - We're safe and sound. - For now. Oh, God. No way we're going back in the basement. No. I know. Come on. Maybe we can find some candles. Remind me I left those there. We might need them again. What are we gonna do? Well... ...nothing's getting past those monster nails, right? - We just wait. - Until what? Until the storm ends. But what if it doesn't? - It will, sweetheart. - And then what happens? Then... Then... ...the Mounties ride in on their big white horses and rescue us... ...and we find out the whole thing was just a bunch kids playing pranks. They get hauled off to juvie for a round of spankings and no dinner for a week. - Two weeks. - Even better. - Two weeks. Minimum. - And no dessert. Absolutely not. We'll make them eat sand. Sand? You know what they call sand for dessert? Desert. Come on. - What is it? What's there? - Nothing. - Why'd you make that sound? - Because there's nothing there. - The hammer. - The monster nails. They're gone. Right. It's okay. Let's just get upstairs. Dad? Maybe it wanted us to nail the doors shut. - What do you mean? - Because maybe we didn't lock it out. Maybe we locked it in. Something wants us to stay. Oh, man. It fell down the hole. I can't reach it. Mrs. Shelton is still having trouble getting over the death of her husband... ...which is not surprising given the nature of their marriage. I recommended to her physician that he prescribe clonazepam. Guys, I'm working. You know the rules. Jake's dolly fell into the gutter and he's having a fit. I'm not having a fit! He's not a dolly! He's an action figure! Hey, hey. Take it easy, Jake. And Cyn, don't push his buttons. Please. Hey. Come on. Mom to the rescue. Let's go. Not while Dad's working. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Well, what if he's broken? - He'll live. - I'm sure he's fine, sweetheart. Mom! Mom! Oh, you guys are too easy. Here you go. - Really not that funny, Mom. - Oh, it was pretty funny. Thanks, Mom! - Don't fall asleep, Daddy. - No. No, no. Daddy's okay. Go to sleep. Daddy's here. Jake! Cynthia! No. No. Cynthia? What are you doing? Where's your brother? I thought we were gonna stay together. What is the--? If you were hungry why didn't you wake me'? Since when do you like mac and cheese? Cynthia, I need you to answer me. Cyn. Why won't you look at me? Why won't you look at me? Because I don't wanna scare you. Stop it, Daddy. You're hurting me. I'm not touching you. No! Dad! Jake! Jake. Piece of shit. Jesus! Jake? Daddy. Dad! Jake. Cynthia. No] Jake! Cynthia! You can't take them! Goddamn it! No! That's impossible. What is happening? Where are you? Daddy, please help. I'm not losing you two. - It's too hot. - Me too. The keys to his truck. It's okay. We're leaving. Dad! Hold on! Goddamn it! It's okay. I got you. Cynthia? Here you go, bud. Cynthia? Baby? Please don't leave me. Don't leave me, honey. I can do this. I can do this all by myself. I love you guys so much. I can be a good dad. Can you hear me? Wake up, Cynthia. Jake, help me. Wake your... Come on. Come on. Come on, you guys. Jake! Cynthia, wake up. Come on, baby, wake up. Wake up, Cynthia! Don't... Kids are your strong suit. Mine's paying the bills. That's the plan. That was always the plan. Remember? You're better at that. You're better at everything. - You're better at playing baseball. - That's crap. Besides, taking care of the kids... ...takes a lot less energy and time... ...than you think. - You make it look easy. - Can I have some water? - I got it. It's okay. - I got it. - Yeah? Sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - I don't mind. Don't say I didn't offer. Leah? Everything okay? Yeah. Clumsy as usual. Yet, strangely, still sexy. No! God, no, Leah! Oh, Goddamn it! I need an ambulance at 421 Still Oaks Lane. My wife she fell, she hit her head. Her neck... Oh, God. Hurry, please! - What? Don't talk. - Can't-- - I'm sorry. - No, Leah, please! Goddamn it, breathe. Baby! Come on. Breathe, Leah. No! Help me, Daddy. Dad's here, buddy. It's okay. Jake! No! Jake! Jake! Jake! No! No! Jake. Open, you son of a-- Jake. Jake! He couldn't have pulled this out. Jake! Jake. Jake. Howes? When the storm ended and you didn't call down for more supplies... ...I figured something might be wrong. So I come up here to help you. - When the storm ended? - Yeah. The storm's been over for days. No, no, no, you're wrong. You're wrong! We've been stranded here for days! The blizzard... Mr. Shade, don't leave me here! No. No, no, no. No, no, no. It's the cabin I went to when I was the kids' age. It's in the middle of nowhere, and that's what makes it great. I'm sorry I couldn't save them. But you did save them. Okay, guys. Change in plans. I think we're coming down with something. So, what do you say we head down... ...we find Mr. Howes and we ask about seeing a doctor? I'll be right back. - It's wet here. Watch your step. - Help me, Dad. Just please don't make me take a bath, Dad, please. Bath? Nothing to worry about. We're on bath vacation. I don't wanna take a bath. - I just wanna sleep. - I know. But you have to. You're burning up. Here you go. It's okay, buddy. I got you. I know. I know. I know. What about you, Dad? You're sick too. Come on! Did you--? Did one of you guys get into this cabinet? Jake, did you do this? Were you looking for something? No, Dad. You know how OCD he is. He would have cleaned it up. You really gotta drink more. I think Jack the Ripper is gone with Mom. What? No, sweetheart. Jack's fine. I want you to bury him for me. Please, Daddy. I want you to bury him for me. Mr. Shade. Are you folks all right? There was no answer so I... Am I glad to see you. - I'm sorry. Excuse me. - You son of a bitch. - Sorry? - It was you. You knew you were sick. I asked you. I asked you if you were sick! "No, I'm just getting over something!" You bastard! You put your hands all over my kids! You stupid son of a bitch! - Get upstairs. - Please, Mr. Shade! Get upstairs! I'm sorry. But you killed my kids. Daddy? Are you okay? Am I okay? Your fever's broke. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Yeah? - Me too. Yeah, you feel better? Come here. Come here. Stay close to me. - Check both doors in that area. - Yes, sir. Mr. Shade? We've been banging on that door forever. - I'm sorry we had to knock it down. - It's okay. - Hey, we found him. Howes is up here. - I'll be right back. - Thanks. - We got a search and rescue team... ...looking for you three days now. Come on. All right, I'm okay. Don't worry. We'll get you home. Lock his ass up. When I saw him, he was so sick... ...half out of his mind with a fever, I suppose. He'll get what's coming to him. aHruaia
