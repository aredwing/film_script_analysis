Chief Bang, I'm sorry, it was my fault. I bothered Officer Kong because it was my son's birthday. 572! Are you on a picnic? Are you upset? You shouldn't have committed a crime if you didn't want to put up with this. Isn't that right? It's Min-woo's birthday and we just wanted to celebrate. Who told you to keep a baby in a place like this. That's a little harsh, Chief. I have my eyes on you. Especially you, 572. There is no special treatment for mothers, you got that? Follow me! Don't be upset. You know what she's like. But she didn't have to rip up the picture. She's acting jealous because she can't have kids. But still... Dancing Prison: Phillipino inmates dance routine But seriously... ... Is my singing voice really that bad? Are you silly? No... But Min-woo cries everytime I sing. I think you're overreacting. No! Really! Look. Sweet dream my baby... My sweet... You see what I'm saying? What's gotten into her? Min-woo! Isn't mommy good? We also could benefit from a program like this! Learn to sing, and exercise! How did a spirited bitch like her kill someone? Trust me it's not so hard in the heat of the moment... hey, really! Cut it out We have a new girl. Are you hungry? Wanna play? What? Hey you! On your feet! Who said you could sit there, huh? Who are you to not make a proper introduction? Leave me alone if you're not gonna kill me. Don't be horrible. She's only so young. And watch the language! You're in front of a child. Unni, obviously she didn't learn any manners in school. What good is manners in here? Just leave her alone. But still Unni! What the hell! Take him. Don't cry sweetheart. You're raising a baby in prison? What? It will be a good memory for him. Bitch. Jeong-hye! Yeon-sil! Call the guards! Guard! Guard! Good lord. Ms. Hong We have medical records on your husband's mental health. We can't help you, if you keep your mouth shut. You have to tell us what happened! I took you under my wings a worthless orphan. How dare you go behind my back? Why were you not picking up the phone? Did you dodge, bitch? You got pregnant so you could fuck around freely didn't you? - Calm down! - Let go! Stop it! Fuck you! I want to die! Don't fucking get in my way! - Please don't do this! - Let go! Stay still. Hold still! I'll kill you, you little...! Yumi-ya? Yumi, is that you? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done to him? What have you done to him? She's a wounded soul. She killed her stepfather after being sexually abused for years. Her term got reduced by 10 years But she continuously tried to commit suicide before coming here. By the way.. ... Min-woo almost didn't eat anything all day without his mom. He only has 6 more months. - Really? - yeah. What a monster! How could one do such a thing to his own daughter. Those bastards should all be castrated. What the hell? 821. One love letter for you. It's not like that. He's just a pen pal. Look at her blush! A girl is a girl. Nothing for me? - Here. Quickly. - What is this? Your husband sent a recordable teddy bear. It's not allowed but no-one knows that it's a voice recorder. Oh, my babies Are you crying? Again? Let's have some watermelon. Crazy cow. Don't read my letter. This is his picture. Isn't he handsome? He looks like a good man. How did you meet him? He doesn't know she's in prison. And she sen't him someone else's picture. She's been receiving his letters to Officer King's address. He works in Saudi Arabia and has been conned for 3 years. Hey... You'll give me a headlock and break my neck too? I know you're a pro-wrestler but I never heard of someone who broke a neck with a headlock. Cut it out. -You're really something. - Have another one. Look at him. He's giving her a hug. Are you giving her a hug for the pain? Stubborn bitch. Come here sweetheart. Don't get mixed up with that bitch. Did you? yes? Really? Hello? Sweetheart It's me. I wrote several letters... You got the wrong number. Baby, please. I beg you. Please... How can a human voice sound like that? Isn't that just amazing? You've got a voice too. Of course! Your voice is far more amazing than theirs. Look at how big you have gotten! Yes, yes. You look exactly like your mother. - Hello - Let's go to mommy. Is it easy enough for you to raise him here? Yes. Thanks to the officers. If there is anything, let me know. Not a difficulty... but I do have a suggestion. what? A choir? It crossed my mind while watching the performance. You know the life here is quite boring. Jeong-hye... Mr. Warden is busy. So you're suggesting organizing a choir as a way of rehabilitation Yes! It's good to watch but even better to have it ourselves. Sounds good to me, too! It'll make a good rehabilitation program. Officer King! It's not appropriate to... You think you can pull it off? What? Do you think you can do a good job of it? What? A choir? And he gave me the full authority with organizing it. He gave you what? You can't even sing. I don't know. It just happened. We've got to make it work no matter what! Start making some sense! But, how do you form a choir anyway? You clueless cow... What's wrong? Let's sleep. Sleep, sleep sleep! Sweet dreams, my baby... My sweet baby... Give him to me. How come he cries everytime I sing? I really don't get it. Everyone does except you. White wild roses blooming on mama's way to work Their white petals taste so good I took a few in the mouth when I was hungry while calling out 'mother, mother'... I have a favor to ask you too. A favor? If I do a good job with it, reward me with a day out. A day out? There has to be motivation for me too. Oh. Of course... Motivation is important. Chief Bang? Ah, yes... I guess. So we have a deal then? All right. You've got yourself a deal. Isn't is great? A choir! Do you have to be a singer? No! You just have to love music. We'll practice once a week, and if we get better, they'll send us to perform outside. - Is that true? - Yes, really! Are you crazy? You can't promise things like that! What if Chief Bang hears about it? I just... Please think before you say something! You're such a troublemaker. Teacher, teacher! Teacher, teacher! Will you let me pee? You will lead the choir as a teacher won't you? Please I'm not interested. But you used to be a music professor. Who could be more qualified for the job? Plus, how else will you see outside these walls before you die... Dumbo! How is your husband? I told you not to call. Stop calling me. Darling... How dare you call me that. You feel like playing a mother now? Do you have any idea what it's like to live as a murderer's daughter? Would you rather... Would you rather that I die? Dying would only make life easy for you. Live as long as you can. May everyday be hell for you. Until the end. Hyun-joo! Hyun-joo! Your daughter declined to see you. Why did you turn her down? I wish I had someone who would visit me. Kids these days are such brats. I wish I had a visitor. Please cover for "Law of harmony" exam. Don't worry about anything other than the concert. And call me before you leave please. I'll meet you at the airport. Thank you. You need a new pair of shoes. I'll get you a pair for present. Really? Wait for me, darling. Wait up! You're such a troublemaker! I said I can't help you! I know nothing about choir. - You can play the piano. - Hardly! Well, you know the basics, dont you? I was scolded by Chief Bang again! You'll get me fired sooner or later. That's why we need to make this work! How can I pull it off without you? I don't care. I don't hear what you say. For the sake of Min-woo please? Take a look. Please give it another thought You're asking the wrong person. - There's no-one else but you. - This is wrong. - I'm on death row. - What's that got to do with music? We'll start from tomorrow. See you here after lunch, okay? Jeong-hye! Unni! Unni [Unni: respected older female] Min-woo! Min-woo! You know how stubborn she is. She'll never change her mind. Is there any way? Jesus! Why are you bugging me? I have no part in this. Min-woo, Min-woo, Min-woo! Are you the new girl? What is a pretty face like you doing here? Get out of the way, kiddo. - What are you staring at, bitch? - Pull him back up. What? What the hell did you say? Fucking bitch! I said pick him back up, bitch! Take him. Forget about the damn thing! A choir with scumbags like them? Rehabilitation through music, my ass! This is the reality. The bitch who got pregnant and the bitches who beat her up. They're all the same. I'll report today's incident to the warden. Don't ever bring up the subject again. Not a day passed quetly since the psycho arrived. Why fuss over a baby that's not even hers. Is that blood? Damn it! Auch, my neck! She must have many scars in her heart. They told me she tried to kill herself several times already. Maybe she hopes to ask for forgiveness with her life. Each day must be filled with an unbearable fear and agony She's not the only one suffering. She has to go back into the world eventually. Unlike me who will die in here. So help her. How? The choir. What's that got to do with it? Because there is no-one else! Just do it for the sake of helping poor souls like her. Teacher, teacher. Teacher, help me. If we succeed, they will let me and Min-woo out for a day. Since he was born, he has never seen the outside world. Help me, please. Your attention please. I'll introduce you to the conductor. Teacher. Clap! I'm not a worthy person for the job. Thank you for having me. I hope this will be an enjoyable experience for everyone. Soon-yi is my name But they call me Elena here Mezzo. Mezzo? What does that mean Unni? Next. Only I can see him~ Only my eyes see him~ Alto. Matchstick factory in Incheon~ Mezzo. What the hell is a "Mezzo"? In human minds~ Ehera diya~ Mezzo. Hallelujah~ Hallelujah~, Hallelujah~ Soprano. Mezzo. I'm too ashamed to strip Alto. It's a jackpot! Jack-jack-jack-jackpot~ Alto. - I'm soft-hearted... - Mezzo. A late night at Mapo Terminal~ - Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai - Next. Aren't you gonna sing? Me? Watch him, please. While mama is away picking oysters the baby stays.. Um, stays~ at home by himself~ - Alto. - Alto? I'm in? Thank you. What wrong? It's gonna be harder than I thought. It was only the first day. There aren't enough strong singers. There were a few good ones though. We're seriously short of sopranos. 572, Hong Jeong-hye. An interview. I think Chief Bang has a point. Maybe we aren't ready for this. There's a high risk for accident having inmates in one place. Forgive me sir, but everyone makes mistakes. I think it's too harsh if you deny them this chance because of their past mistakes. It's not their past but what might happen in the future we're worried about. It's the negative attitude towards rehabilitation that fails us. Shut your mouth! How dare you! Calm down, calm down. Let's not get heated up. How about this? We need to run a rehabilitation program for the next 2 quarters. I'll give you 6 months. Let's see what happens. But if there is no change after 6 months, You have to drop the choir. Do you understand? 572! 572! The summer's gone and all the roses falling It's you, it's you who must go and I who must bide~ The ranch... Stop! Stop! Please come forward. Come, come. Anyone play the piano? Officer Kong plays piano. - Are you kidding me? - Sorry. Sorry won't cut it! I'll kill the goddamn... Is murder your hobby? I'm Sorry. The most important thing in singing is the posture. Tighten your stomach. The summer's gone~ and...! The summer's gone and all the roses fall~ It's you who must go and I who must bide~ The ranch... I finished Bayer, but quit while practicing Czerny 100. It's harder than I thought. Will we be able to make it? If only we had a solid soprano. Actually, there is one... It's real this time. You won't give me your tongue? How do I do that? I've never done it before. Let's see if that's true. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Of all programs why checkers? I seriously don't understand why! Teacher! Soprano, soprano. Teacher, go for it! Officer King told me you studied music before you came here. I know what you're going to say. I'm not joining the choir. I wasn't gonna talk about that. We're gonna die in here anyway, you and I. What? Let's die quetly with some dignity. Don't fucking bother me. Teacher. Please don't be upset. The bitch doesn't think we can do it without her. Hang on... Come on. What is it? You got something to say to me? If not, then leave. I'm sorry. For what? For... Being rude. Come here. There was a number I used to play with my daughter all the time. It's hard isn't it? It doesn't get easier for me either. Even then, let's try to live the rest of our days with a smile If you miss her too much... If it's hard to endure let us be each other's consolation and provide shoulders to cry on. Bravo! That was great! Fantastic! A round of applause! 48! They say even earthworms have a talent for rolling. Not earthworms, slugs. Potato potaato, dummy! When did you learn to sing like that? Singing was her major. It was all she did day and night. You'd have to be an idiot not to sing that well. But you were a professional singer. How come you're not as good? I only sang at night! Whereas she also sang during the day. - What difference does it make? - A hell of a difference, cow! How dare you raise questions? Guard! My son is sick! Guard! Guard! What's the matter? I don't know. He's been throwing up everything he ate. He's boiling hot, too. Give him to me. You know you can't come with him. I'm sorry but that's the rules. - I'll take good care of him. - Kong please! I'll be good I beg you! Officer Kong, can't you do anything about it? Min-woo Come on out. I'm so sorry. You have to at least let me cuff you. It's the rules. I called you a few minutes ago. - That way. - Thank you. Sit over there. Brave little guy aren't you? Not crying once during the injection. Hey, you're not the criminal. Why act so nervous? Oh.. I'm sorry. A mother's hand has the best healing power. Sweet dream, my baby... My dear hometown is Cheong-ju Women's Penitentiary. Stop! Come on out here. Straighten your back and pull the chin. Tighten the stomach And smile! Who the fuck was that? What's wrong with you? I quit you old hag! Hey! What the fuck did you say? You got a fucking problem? Stop it! You're not kids anymore. Act your age! You need to open your hearts. Music is nothing if you don't open up. If there is anyone not ready to open up their hearts, please leave now. My name is Son Chae-bin. I'm 27 years old, from Ulsan. I got additional punishment for special theft.

What can you do? You just have to bury him in your heart. - When is the date? - The day after tomorrow. It's okay. This is what's best for him. This is really not a suitable environment for him. I love you! This is outright wrong! How can they do this? Hush now. No-one can be more heart-broken than the mother. What kind of law separates a child from his mother? What the hell are you crying about? Did you think he could live with us in this tiny cell forever? Let me take the bag. Let's go. O wind, send my love to her~ What's the matter? Who died today, huh?

Senoya, senoya~ The mountains and the ocean~ The mountains and the ocean~ We will, we will~ I feel like a zombie singing like this. You're right. Let's spice it up a bit. Why don't we hear Officer Kong sing? Hey, Kong. Go on. Sing us a song. - Sing! - Sing! I can't sing! - Sing! - Sing! Can you think of something hot! Something exciting to do?~ Like taking a trip when you've got tons of work to do. Like going bungee jumping off a rooftop. Like strip-teasing in a subway station. Like doing a crazy dance with flowers in your hair. Like shaving off your head the day before a blind date. Like jogging naked on a rainy winter night. I woke up this morning and my mind fell away and looking back sadly from tomorrow. As I heard an echo from the past softly saying Come back, come back, wont you stay. I wanted to reach you to let you know I still care. And lost in the silence of my sorrow I put a promise in the wind, on the air to fly away to you there. Touch the wind Catch my love as it goes sailing. Touch the wind and I'll be close to you I'll be easy to find 4 Years Later Sorry! I have an important announcement.

We'll carry out a closer inspection. Take off your clothes. - We told you it wasn't us! - Be quiet! Don't make a fuss! Clothes off now! What you're doing now is an infringement of human rights. And you're interrupting the course of justice. Search them! I'll have to ask for your understanding on some last minute changes. The performance by Cheong-ju Women's Penitentiary Choir is cancelled due to some unexpected circumstances. - What? - I ask for your understanding. - Up next we'll have Bitsori choir - That can't be! Please give them a warm welcome. Fucking hell! All right! I'll strip. Do your fucking search all you want! Look! Chief Bang! What do they mean the performance is cancelled?

Why are you not taking your shirt off? Take your hands off me. Did you see us steal it? - Stop it! - Hold still! Get your hands off of her! You fucking thieves! How dare you cause disturbance!

The people who came here were selected from the model prisoners! Dozens of extra officers were dispatched for the occasion. Are you accusing us of being negligent at our job? If our choir is responsible for the theft I'll take the blame myself What are you doing? Get up now! I won't fucking do it. It's their loss if they miss out on our performance. I'm lost for words!

We had anticipated this but... ... I didn't know the order would be issued to quickly. Officer Kong Na-young! How can you be late on a day like this? I'm sorry. This won't happen again. That's all for this morning. Chief Bang, brief her on this morning's meeting. Yes, sir. Something is weird. Who died? What's with the atmosphere? - Well... - You're acting weird, too.

You're right. I must be coming to the end of my days. All these things that happened... Why do you say such a horrible thing? Spit on the floor and hop three times. I feel really great. You must be so happy. They'll come visit more often now? That's right. Someday, your child will be able to understand you too. Teacher, you have to treat us. Right, and not just us but the whole choir! That's no problem. Let's go. Chief. No... No. No... No... Why did you let him go like that? I didn't know what to say. I wanted to take him home with me. You husband is a midget. What do you see in him seriously? What? He's way better than your Deok-pal! 522, you have a visitor. Get ready please. Kong. What's wrong with you today? Anyway, your luck must be coming down on you all at once. You never had any visitors and suddenly... What's the matter? Are you envious of me? Tell them you won't see them. It's okay. Don't go please. Don't go! I'm sorry for not being there until the end. Don't say sorry! Why?! Don't say sorry now! It's okay. Stop crying. Mom... Mom... I'll be okay. Mom! Jeong-hye, I'll be fine. Moon-ok. I'm not leaving in shame. So that's okay. It's okay. White wild roses blooming on mama's way to work Their white white petals taste so good I took a few in the mouth when i was hungry I ate them while calling 'mama, mama' The night is dark and mama is hurrying back home On her own, her pale ankles bare Every night I dream a white white dream of her of her coming home to me
