This is a last photo together. Shortly after this photograph was taken, everything has changed. We don't dicede ourselves others do for many factors be affect the decision of our life If I was born in Turkey, not Germany... I often think that, how would be my life. I owe the German economic miracle to be a "Made In Germany ". Especially since the middle of the 1950's... ...regular labor force began to arrive from Southern Europe. Who want to go as workers, they are being examined in their country The procedure almost looked like an animal market. Only for healthy ones were possible to go to Germany. You know, there is a labor scarcity in the labor market Spanish and Italian workers didn't have enough at the time. We decided to benefit from Turkish workers A guest worker is subject to the headlines on 10 September 1964. This is a historic day. on that date because the number of immigrants... ...reached the highest level. One of these immigrants will be recorded in history. Please first you. -No, first you. Congratulations to One-millionth guest worker. Welcome. but the only one. But, the worker of the millionth Armando Rodriguez was surprised... ...for him a ceremony and a gift motocycle. He and other workers didn't understood yet, they became an indispensable element for the welfare of Germany. Armando Rodriguez, at that times... ...even though the worker of a millionth... We want to tell, the first one millionth's life. A man named Huseyin Yilmaz, my grandfather's life. My grandfather was stepping such as to the promising great hopes future in Germany. Hey, Huseyin, wait a minute! 45 YEARS LATER I've changed my mind. I don't want German passport. Have you lost your mind? Why we have the application made for naturalization?

We are from there? So, I want to go Turkey in next holiday, all together. The house is old and must be renovated. It would be very good, if all of you help. We made other plans for the holiday... We can not come. Muhammad let it go. He don't have job already. I pay his flight ticket. Veli! -What? Is it Lie? I am paying all the flight tickets! Super! -Forget it either. Enough is enough! Rest, dammit. What I ever wanted from you, as your father? lts just sitting around here and makes blabla... Shame on you! We are a family. We are a Turkish family! What are we now? German or Turks?

No way! You must play one team German or Turkish either! If my grandfather, grandmother are Turkish, Why live here? Because... Because the Germans called them. -How? Not only them, a lot of Turks, Yugoslav and also called Italian. All invited here. -Really? Dear citizens of the world! The Federal Republic of Germany calls out to you! Our country is looking for the labor. If you are young, stronger and hard worker... Please contact to the nearest public office immediately. And then what happened? You want to listen to the whole story? Everything is started in a small village in Southeastern Turkey. Look, here. Near to the new grandfather's home. A small plain, a very pretty village. but I must tell you Turkish. Here is pretty village on small plain. People ordinary, but they were living nice and comfortable. They were working by to sow field and animals feed. Life was going flow in usual layout. Only a young man, let's say him grandfather. He was living very exciting days, cuz he felt in love with squire's daughter. Not that fat in the middle, which is nice. She is my grandmother. No, our girl is not right for you Go and find yourself another girl. They don't know German? Okay! In German; No! Hseyin didn't accept, they said to him "no". And he abducted her. At that time was enough a single man touch a woman... ...people are consider that contaminated girl's honor. What mean "Honor"? How do you explain this? Such as a sexual things? Grab the chickens run run! Veli, Muhammed! Alas the jig is up! Assholes! How many times I said you that don't grap poor chickens. Poor chickens couldn't ovulate due to fear. We didn't, I swear it is really, father. Huseyin was working hard for keep his family. But money earned, It wasn't enough. Look what say here! What does it say? I'm illiterate. Germany still invite the workers. My uncle's son in law working in there since long time. He is sending home sight of money every month. Really. You could buy a car and saving money during the year. Bye-bye, my dear, Call me. Have a godspeed! I love you so much. Hseyin went to Germany as guest worker. such as many others were leaving his hometown for the first time... A completely different country where everything. Especially language. Thankfully, there is a interpreter for welcome ceremony. Dear guest workers Welcome! Today a very important day for all of us and hope that we will work successfully together. I'm coming. Welcome, welcome, Welcome! Dad! Dad! Shall I tell my mother. Muhammed, Leyla... How much you've grown. Didn't you recognize me? I'm... Don't you know who is he? your father. Hseyin wasn't thinking bring his family to Germany. My goodness, head scarf! So how they went to Germany? What? Exactly as it is! your son run away from school completely 21 days. four! six! I can buy for five. five and a half? Asshole If I catch you. Run, be quick. Cigarettes stolen I guess, don't have anything in your family about discipline. I working day and night, I'm trying for became a man like you ignorants... but you are running away from school asshole! My father again swearing himself. Come here, I'll break your bones. I'll take to Germany all of you. Then, you'll learn the disciplinary order. cuz Germans are expert about discipline. After you'll see, what is it meaning run away from school. Seriously, he will take us to Germany? No, no son. Look, Did you see? I set everything to fly for the next week. My son, read. Mister Yilmaz I'm glad for inform to you that... your family reunification request has been accepted. It was time to farewell. Did you know that? Everywhere filled with the Coca-Cola in Germany Is it really? Of course! There are in everywhere. Can you send me a little bit when you arrived there? No no. Why is that? Cuz coke bottle couldn't fix in the envelope. Happy I'm not having to go. Why? Everybody infidel in there. My brother said; Germans eat pork and human. They have a dead man hung the cross. Even they eat him. They going to church every sunday for eat his flesh and drink his blood. They eat human? hi hi! Take dear, they say Germany is so cold. Take these, I made, they say Germans are so dirty. And these from me, not too much but they say there are just potatoes in Germany. Just potatoes? Before journey to Germany last night, grandmother said to everyone for remembering their dreams. Because it shows the future of dreams to believe. As luck would have it, nobody remembered dreams in that night. Except uncle Muhammed. Aah my ear is bleeding! Rat bite me. Fucking rats Muhammed vomited. Oh god asshole. Why you vomited the room? Look at, what you did. Fatma! Why you are yelling the kid Huseyin? poor thing was afraid. Come, my boy. Wash and put on something clean. Give me your hand, give me What kind of man you are? Push! Push! Goodbye. Take care. Why they pour water? This is a very old Turkish tradition. Who goes a long way, people pour water behind of him Their way get open, such as water; for quickly go and come back They wish that this will be. How a strange place here. Here appear like our place. No, not at all. Look at the here. Everything completely different here. Ok! now let's go, it's late. Cenk 's got school tomorrow! Come on, get up! -But still early! Why homeland is different? -Soon you'll see. Because we go together to the homeland. Because grandpa bought a home... and he needs a family help. All of the family. We now let's run away. -Yes, also we gotta go. There are two job interview tomorrow. Of course. Thanks. Look Dad, it is also. Done? Let's clean your mouth. Let's read what fairy tale? "Small Brave Tailor" or... "Seven or Crows"? I want it. -"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves. Was Ali Baba the Turk? According to that-a very brave... Exactly was the Turk. Why I don't know Turkish? You are talking a little bit now. I couldn't go. Really I'm sorry but I have exams. Exam, exam, exam... The greatest test in life is to know what is important and what is not. Who knows when the next time, we can go on vacation a complete family. It is better if you come with us. Everything will be very nice. You'll see. These are don't have any other hobbies? Non-stop proliferated that wilds. There is such thing as birth control pills, but I'm sure they don't know how to use. Pardon We must be tolerant toward foreigners. Lazing in the forrest all day doesn't come to mind something else. What we do know sit back and fuck! Who talked to you? There are people who loves their children... Although more than a half-past... What do you say? I'm going on holiday to Turkey. What? But why? How will you go like this? David, just six-week pregnant. Not even the tip of the finger. Also how can I say to my family should think that. They will hate me. Woman? Lord in heaven! Woman? Woman, you're probably getting old. Can not you hear that the water boiler whistles for hours? And why do you have green olives bought? You know, I only like the black. But I like green olives. Aha. Will you diet again? I'm tired black olives to eat. For 50 years We eat black olives. I guess, subject isn't the color of the olives, right? Tell me, what's on your mind. The house! Why did you buy the house? I told you that, I will not return to Turkey! My place is with my children in Germany! Who has claimed that, we return? Do not we? And the house? A summer home for the holidays. The awful taste! Huseyin look, what we have received by mail. An invitation. For immigrants. We're now German. "Germany say thank you..." They want me to do a speech? And even front of the Chancellor! They are crazy! Never do that! Almighty! Front of Angela Merkel? Stop, stop, put these, and also these. Are you crazy? -Why? These are what's? Want to open a store in Turkey or what? These are gifts! I don't want you to go. I can't cancel, I have tried, but... I need the time, to talk to my mom. Can happen everything in Turkey! Then I'll go with you, and also I considered to your family. No, not my family.

So what? I didn't understand. Giant Rat, here there are giant rats Where? Alas, those eat us. Idiot, that isn't rat that is a dog. Why didn't have a normal leg. And also why they tied the rats?

A male man must be mustache. We are like that. But nobody has mustache here, not good. Now, my grandfather was not understand his children language. So, they decided to vacation to their country. Where comes everyone for see there. Hseyin. I didn't say? Take the things which are necessary. I swear Hseyin, didn't put too much panties. Look, you moved all the supermarket here. who knows how much money these things? How we can go to the country that our hand is empty, then they say miserly. Yes, cuz money growing on trees.

Hseyin, calm down. you are worst than kids! I have to pee, I can not wait three days. The distance between their old and new countries was 2521km. They went to 3 days 3 nights. When they arrive, realized stop the time is impossible. because everything had changed, also themselves had changed. I will make poo here? This is for you from Germany. Thanks! This is coca-cola, real German coke. You brought just one bottle, that's all? How was difficult it bring here, do you know? Your cousin in Germany brought for Kemal the remote control car. You skimp and bring me just one bottle. At least, you could bring with bottles case. Also, you have too much money. Keep it. What happened to the son? Emre wasn't there? He wanted remote control car, even I don't have. He said, I'm measly Measly? Even kids began to talk like this things. Their troubles only money, money, money... In Germany, we have a donkey shit the gold. Hseyin! What is it lie? Fatma! A power cut. Sons of bitches, If always it will be happen, then why pay the money in vain? This is the second time this week. That was actually small problems. But problems enlarged with time. Although, my grandfather didn't make a plan bought a house from Germany instead of Turkey. All of them was living in that house? -Yes. Why my grandfather, grandmother are speaking bad German? Grandfather, why bad your German? Who is this caller? Miss called four times. A friend from school, I guess needed book or something. Mother... He is not a friend from school... And also... And, I'm pregnant. You are a fucking brother. When Melek leaves me where were you? When I'm all alone, even you didn't turn a hair! I sent the money to you? Not enough? Everyone try one's best. I guess you are not to be able to help. Sevgi wants to divorce me. Good... Finally she understood you are a asshole. How could you that? Is that must have been for answer to my work-hard? We will be notorious. Thanks God, your father didn't see these days. And also a German! -British... British? Why British? We have been living together for two years. I love him. I got pregnant involuntary. Do you want to make a abortion? Be quiet now, it's a sin! Will you take your life, Allah has given? Thank the Almighty, my father didn't know that! My grandfather knew it. He asked me. How did he know I don't know but he understood. Right. He has also always known before me. What? Something happened? When your father kidnapped me, I was also pregnant. So then I'm the only Decent in this family. I can't find my key. Stupid in reception also not there. Can I stay here? -No, no. What will be invitation? My grandfather was going to a speech. Thanks for you allowed to sleep in your room. I'm sorry... for Sevgi. Whose dogs are these? Nobody. Now, where is my grandfather? Come here. Dede here. And here. Death is not something bad... This is normal. People birth, growth and lives. Then they go away. -Where they go? Well, now sit down here. Do you remember we talked about water? So, was changing the shape... And... Normal temperatures, for example, as it's now... ...water is liquid. When air be cold then transform to ice. When boiling... is evaporates, understand me? in other words, rear up... So... Water, no matter how and... which become... ...it has always been. Do you understand what I mean? My grandfather is evaporated. Yes... ...something like that. This is the address of the cemetery for foreigners. There must be some misunderstanding, My husband was Turkish! That may be, But he has a German passport As a German, he is not allowed on a Muslim cemetery to be buried. This may not be. What do you mean, He can not be buried? My father was a Turk! Friends, always we can find away for solve I can solve it for you. What you had in mind? Ten thousand Euros! Corrupt pimp! Also, foreigners cemetery at the bottom of hell! Something happened? Stop! We bring your father to the village. Immediately! Mother, you've heard it yourself, my father is a German according to passport. This is just a piece of paper. Your father never wanted to be German. If he is not buried in the village, I will never forgive me. Mother, without the necessary papers you can not. But we have now a piece of land in the village. Mother it is illegal. Mom, this is unlawful. For thousands of years We bury our dead in the ground. What is it illegal? It is rights of Hseyin. If you want to go back with Cenk... -Are you crazy? We are a family. We will bury my father, together. Wherever. OK. Then we agreed. Olives are these? Come, I will help you. Is this home? What is this? Only the ruins. This is not home. -Not a full house. What happened? I'm staying here. I will build the house. I decided. Prime Minister Angela Merkel, under indefinite "Germany say thanks to you" ...issued an invitation 200 immigrants invited the first-generation... ...in Bellevue Palace. The thing that was interesting in the invitation a unusual spiker. Watch the news from Thomas Kleinbauer. My name is Cenk. Huseyin Yilmaz is my grandfather. He died a short time ago. I know, what wanted to say. Cuz we framed together this speech. Mr. Prime Minister, Dear citizens! Thanks... ...for all... Thank you very much. I'm a person as the first one million worker coming to the germany for work... I'm very happy to address you. I have been living here for 45 years. We had ups and downs. But I'm happy today. A wise man give an answer to the question of who and what we are; We are, everything that is happen before us, lived before our eyes and considered fitting for us, We are, their existence affects our existence and neither do we affect their existence humans and things. We are, have been after us, If we had not born, will not exist of everything. We invited the labor but people came. I want to summarize in one sentence, Company management experience: If we had to decide again, only we wanted Turkish workers. Usually question sentences has the "w" letter. What, why, when... Cenk. What happened? What is this? A Turkey Map. -Thank you very much. It's beautiful. Let's add that here? Well, then help me. Come on. Yes, here in Istanbul... So where is the Anatolia? Yes, here. You can sit now. You see, Turkey is a much larger country. What happen Engin? -Actually, I'm from Ovacik, in Anatolia. Therefore... Then I will put your name to there.
