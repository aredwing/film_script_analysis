When they were found out a mob dragged him into a field and... sawed off his right hand. They took honeycomb from a beehive and covered his body in honey. A swarm of bees attacked and killed him. That is one messed-up way to die. They say he came back from the death. His hand replaced by a bloody hook. Call his name 5 times into a mirror and he appears... and when he comes, he'll be the last thing you ever see. They call him the Candyman. Come on... You called his name five times and nothing happened. - Right? - I've never done it. No shit? Ok... - Come on. - What are you doing? I guess I'll just have to prove this to you. Five times, right? No, no... No, no, no, don't do this. No. It's for your own good. All right... Candyman... All right... Candyman... - Ok, I get your point. - Candyman... Candyman... You're right... He doesn't exist. - Right... - It's just a story. Yes... that's what I've been trying to tell you. Now, get your little ass over to the gallery and get the show over with. Gosh, I'm late for my audition. Seora, seora... I have some sweets. Would you like to buy some? - They're real cheap. - I don't speak spanish. Candy, candy, candy, candy... They're for the "Day of the Dead". - How much for one, little boy? - One dollar. - Oh, no, thank you. No, I couldn't. - Go ahead. A gift from me to you. Okay. Thank you. On the "Day of the Dead", they remind us that death is sweet. Personally... I like to take a bite out of the death. "Happy Day of the Dead". "Sweets to the sweet"! Shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... the whole urban myth was based on this bad boy and I got his paintings. That's right, homes. It's authenticated. Hold on one second. Guys, that's leaning to the left. Yeah, yeah, Jeffrey... listen, I'm talking a killer show, all right? Now you're fucking art-critic. You're not gonna see anything like this. Yeah, you'll have an exlusive. Just get your ass down here, ok? - You asshole. - Hold on one second. You held out on me, Ruca. You didn't tell me this was the Candyman. This is the reason I didn't tell you. Mickey... you can't do this. Jeffrey, Jeffrey... Can I call you back in about 10 minutes? All right... Peace. - Now, baby. - No. Daniel Robitaille was an artist. Not some monster with a hook. - This is unfair. It's bullshit. - Ok, all right. Take a breath... - please. - I want people to know... Daniel Robitaille as a man... not some twisted urban myth. Yeah, I hear you, baby. Guys, lift up the left side, please. - Mickey! - What? You're turning this show into exactly what I didn't want. It's just an angle, baby. I'll pull the paintings, Mickey. - I own them. - All right, look. Let's chill. Now, I agreed to show the paintings, but I did it to promote my gallery. Now, these pieces, they're good, they're fucking great. But I need an angle. I mean, come on. Saturday is Day of the Dead. It's "Synergy". You cannot buy promotion like this. I make a name for the gallery. And you get a lot more people to hear your side of the story. Right? Right...? Relax... I'll honor the dead. Man, that's not straight. Hold on one second. Left side, pendejos, left side! - Like that. - Yeah, but how do you do that? - Miguel? - Yeah, babe. There's some guys here to see you. Aw, shit. What? Who are they? Cops. Kraft... Sacco... So... looks like you're having another opening night tonight. Everything up to code? - Got all your licences in place? - Yeah. All the paperwork's in back, but I'm sure you guys will find... some way to bust my balls. You always do. Yeah, your kind's always up to something. Is that all? 'Cause I'm busy. Yeah... Get back to your business... Miguel. Catch you later. Miss... L.A.'s finest assholes. Are you serious? Joe... it so nice to see you! - Good to see you! ...It has been long time... - Oh, well, you know, busy as... I never took you for an art lover. You ok? You know... I don't know if this show was a good idea. It's not... going the way I wanted. - Ow! - What's blood for...? - if not for shedding. - Oh, don't want... Excuse me... So... who was Daniel Robitaille? And why did he become the Candyman? It all began... when a confederate army colonel hired the young black artist... to paint the portrait of his only daughter... ...Caroline. They fell in love... And it was a love as forbidden as it was passionate. When they were discovered... The colonel gathered an angry mob and chased him down like an animal. They tied him to a tree, where his body was ravaged by bees! Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman... By the time mob chanted his name for the fifth and final time... Daniel Robitaille was dead. Stories of the Candyman spread througout the black population of the South. They said the hate, that had killed the young artist, had created something evil. Hate generates hate! Evil breeds evil. This man couldn't lash out in life. But in death that... that hate, that evil was strong enough to bring him back... ...to reclaim what was taken away. Do any of you dare call his name? Do you? Daniel Robitaille was just a man. Ladies and gentlemen... Daniel Robitaille's great great granddaughter... Caroline McKeever, give her a hand. I think it's sad that this wonderful artist's memory... is overshadowed by all those stories... It's not who Daniel Robitaille was... The soul of a good man is reflected in these paintings. That is what's real. He should be remembered for what he left behind. His art... Not the terrible myth that has haunted my family for years. But... what about the Candyman, huh? How can you deny the stories? - I don't believe in him or the stories. - Prove it. Call his name 5 times, - it's gonna be... - I'm not gonna play this game. Why not? You afraid he might appear? No. But in the back of your mind you still have some doubt, don't you? Well? Candyman... Candyman... Candyman... Candyman... Candyman... See? Nothing. Do not tempt the powers of darkness... For the hour of dead. - Is at hand! - Get him outta here! He will come for you... - He will come for you. - I said get him out! He will come for you! He will come for you... Hey... I'm sorry. I guess things got a little carried away... I... I'll be fine. Cool. Miguel? We're outta here or what? Yeah, baby, I'll be there in one second. New friend? Lina... something. She's a model... - You're pathetic. - No, I know, I know. Mira, do me a favor and put this on my desk. I'm gonna go close this deal. Oh my God... Mickey! Mickey? Mickey! And the award for the best actor goes to David de La Paz as the Candyman freak... Hey, I'm sorry if I scared you, I got carried away with the part. You're an actor? - A very well-paid actor. - Nice doing business with you. I'll take that. Hey, you ok? - You're so fucked. - Yes, I know. But you have to admit it was cool, right? We had that Melrose crowd shitting in their pants. - I'm out of here! - Hey... come on... Come on, Caroline, we're just having fun. - Don't you need a ride home? - I'll get home myself. Ay... caramba. She's cute, man. You better watch where you're walking. It's dark in here. C A R O L I N E... Caroline... You doubted me... And yet you call my name... Who are you? Your past... Your present... Your future... Your blood... What do you want? I... came... for you... Believe... in me... Mickey? Mickey, it's Caroline. Mickey? Son of a bitch! Miguel? That gross! Yes, sauce. It's Caroline! Mickey, are you here? Get this off... - Come here, my little bumblebee. Miguel? Miguel? Get them away! What the fuck's going on? What the fuck's going on? Oh, putamadre! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Help me! Help me!... Miss McKeever... I'm detective Jamal Matthews. This is detective Jamie Gold. Hi. Miss McKeever? I already told them everything. I... I just wanna go home. Miss McKeever... Why don't we go out and get some air? We need to talk. I already told them everything. Look I know, but I still have some questions. - Maybe we can get a cup of coffee. - I don't want any coffee. - Beaner's doing pretty good for himself. - Tell me about it. - Then he goes and gets himself killed. - Ay, caramba! We got it from here, Jamal, why don't you take a boot. Take a hike. Look, we're taking care of it, okay? We investigated a robbery this morning... involving the victim. We got primary. Like he said, Jamal... why don't you go shoot some hoops? - What, the hell, did you say to me? - Come on, it's not worth it. That's right, sweetheart. It isn't. Det Sacco? Caroline McKeever? I'm detective Samuel Kraft. We met at the gallery yesterday. I'm sorry, Caroline. I have some... questions regarding, what you told the first officer on site. You said that a male hispanic... David de La Paz... was the last person, you saw with Miguel and the girl. You said that he was carrying a weapon of some sort. It was a prop... A meat hook. He was an actor. I have witnesses that say this guy went ballistic at the show. It was an act. He was an actor. Tell me about... The Candyman... The Candyman? We just came from Miguel's gallery. The place had been broken into. All the paintings were stolen... Stolen? We think the robbery and the murders are connected. Someone obsessed with this killer. This Candyman. There's no such thing as the Candyman. You wanna be alone? My roomate's upstairs. Here's my home number... If you can think of anything else, just give me a call... anytime. Day or night. Hey... We used to give Miguel a hard time, but... underneath it all, we really liked him. I'm sorry about what happened. Thanks. "Underneath it all... We liked him"? What's that crock of shit? Oh, you trying to get in her pants, aren't you? Let's go... Next you'll be showing up on her doorstep with a dozen roses. - She's a witness. - She's a piece of ass, is what she is. Shit. Caroline... Oh my God. Tamara! Who are you? Get... Get away from me... Oh my God. What do you want? Oh my God! Oh, no, no. Don't kill me! Oh my God! Please, don't kill me! - Don't! Oh, please! - Tamara! Don't kill me! I got the part! It's a horror movie... Are you ok? God... Help me! Help me! Help... Caroline... they're shooting the scene in Burbank... and I left the production office number on the fridge. They're gonna find out who did this, ok? It was him... I called his name and he came... My mother knew it. The night she died... She'd called his name. You must destroy the myth... As long as people believe... As long as they... call his name... He will always come back. It's ok, mom. It's ok. Two hours later she was dead. Caroline, I want you to stop this. Your mother committed suicide... - I don't know any more. - Caroline... I saw him kill Mickey. No, no, you found their dead bodies. You couldn't deal with it, so your mind made up the rest. Some nut-job... obsessed with the Candyman killed Miguel and that girl. And the police are gonna find out who did it. And it's not gonna be some guy with the hook for a hand. I'm sorry. Do you want me to stay? Well, you page me if you need me. What, the hell, did you tell the cops? The've been playing "good cop, bad cop" on my ass all afternoon. Turned my shit inside out. I'm sorry, but I just told them the truth. That Miguel hired you as an actor. Right... an actor, not a killer. I've known Miguel for years... We went to the same school since we were little. I loved Miguel, I wouldn't kill him. I wouldn't kill anybody! Then you've nothing to worry about... But Miguel and Lina were killed with the hook. If it's the same hook I had in the gallery last night. It's got my fingerprints on it. - I'm screwed. - Don't worry, I told them the truth. What fucking planet o you live on? You know what they say about this cop Kraft? He's been investigated 5 times for police brutality. He likes to close the case, no matter who he's pinned it on. And in his mind I'm just another wetback. And if he can pin it on me... it's miller time... He's closed the case; He goes home to Simi Valley; and I'm up in chino doing life. Look, I'm innocent... I didn't do this... I know... I'm sorry. Hell, if they done their... fucking job. Then they'd know it wasn't me. Word on the street is: A gang... broke into, the gallery and stole the paintings. They probably killed Miguel and the girl. A gang? What gang? - I don't know yet. - Why didn't somebody tell the cops? The gallery's in Boyle Heighst. If you live in east L.A., you don't go outta your way to be friendly with cops. Well... we have to find them. Find who? We have to find that gang. What, the hell, are you talking about? If we can find them and prove that they did it... no one else could have. Not you... Not anybody. Hey Sac, have we found the murder weapon yet? No. Still looking. Hey, you know that Caroline McKeever? Do a backround check. See what you can find out. What's wrong, Sam? - She didn't like the roses? - You go to hell. Just check her out. We're looking for some cholos that were hanging out near Miguel's gallery. You need to find somebody talk to Tino. - Tino? - Yeah. But tell him you're my cousin, 'cause he don't like talking to strangers. Cool. - Okay, later, primo, take care. - Okay. - Thanks. - Hey, you're welcome. Hey, this is a good one, man. What's the matter? It's... him. No, Miguel hired some taggers to paint it to promote the show. A few years ago, they found a little girl, she was murdered there. People in the neighborhood- they believe it's a place of evil. That's why Miguel chose it. It's not... it's not the Candyman. Efa... I'm looking for Tino. What do you want, sweetheart? I want to talk to him. One moment, pretty. I think she likes you. I... I've seen that guy before. Everybody in Boyle Heighst knows Tino. And Tino knows everybody. Hey boy! Hey, just hang, ok? - Flowers? Flowers for the dead. - No. For the Day of the Dead. Flowers for the dead. Yes. Excuse me. I have shown you death... Yet still, you doubt me... In death... lies your destiny. Mom? Caroline... Our story shall be one... One... destiny... One family... One... blood. No. No. Easy. You ok? That's everything. I... thought I could convince myself that he didn't exist... But he does. He's haunted my family for years. And now he's come for me. Hey... Come on. There is somebody I want you to meet. What're you doing, old man? - What're you doing here? - Bueno. Where are we going? You'll see. What's going on? Papi. - You're supposed to be in bed, huh? - That lady was crying real good. I told you never to listen in. But it's so much fun. Hi... This is my daughter Cristina. Hi. Ok. Let's go to the bed. - Ok. - Bye. -Bye. - She's beatiful, David. - Thanks. She's all I have since her mother died. David... Grandmother, how are you? I am waiting for my time to come, my son. This is my grandmother. Grandmother, this is Carolina. Hi. You have brought her here to see me. My... my grandmother's a curandera. She's a healer. You know, people in the neighborhood, they come to her... when they have problems with the spirit. She can heal you. She can help you. You know, I don't think that... Is that a good thing? Come on. Come close. Something hunts you. You don't wanna face the evil. But nobody escapes evil. You have to face it. Stand up. Speak the name of this evil. Do as she says. Say... ...his name. Candyman. Very strong. VERY STRONG. Evil cannot exist without good... Without one, the other cannot exist. Grandmother... easy. Excuse me, I'll be right back. This way. Easy. Hello? Hey. - Ok. Sure, Tino. Thanks. - I'm scared of the Candyman too. I heard about him also at school, they say... if you call him 5 times, he'll come and get you. Hey Cristina, what did I say, huh? Yeah? Go to bed. I appreciate you bringing me here, but... it didn't help. I don't know if anything can help. Give her a... What are you doing, vato? - Hey man, get off me... - Let him go! You like hanging out with this latin lover... because he's dangerous? - Remember what he did to Miguel. - I didn't do anything to Miguel. Let him go! You don't know what you're getting into, little girl. You don't know these people. I've been a cop for 14 years, I know. Hey man, you got something on me? Then arrest me. Otherwise get the fuck outta here! I'm watching you, vato. You make me sick. What, the fuck, are you looking at? Are you ok? - Yeah. Now you know why we don't get friendly with the cops around here. Come on. Surrender to me. Witness my madness. In death you will become a legend. Stories of your death will be used to frighten children. Lovers will hold each other tight... at the mere mention of our names. Be my victim. Hey, look, I know you're going through a tough time... But tommorow I'll com pick you up first thing... and we're gonna find these guys and you'll be able to rest. We both will. All right, I'll see you. David? Yeah? Could you stay a while? My roomate is still not in and... I don't wanna be alone. Sure. I see you've done these before. Well, a few more of these and all your troubles will be set aside for the night. Gimme your hand. No, no, no, no... I'm not drinking alone. Your turn. Oh, chihuahua! What exactly is the Day of the Dead? It's a day to honor the loved ones that have died. You go to the cemetary and you have lunch with them. - Get out of here. - No, I'm serious. You go have a picnic at the grave of those you've lost... to celebrate death as a part of living. I couldn't bring myself to visit my mother's grave. It was just too difficult. Reminds me that I'm all alone. And your father? Died before I was born. And you got no brothers, no sisters, no family? I'm the last one. I'm all alone. No, you're not. You won't know true extasy, until you've tasted death. David... No. Another daughter will be orphaned,... unless you surrender to me. Where is he? If he is... to live. You must come to me... Accept your destiny. Accept your fate. Be... my... victim. Wake up, baby. It's okay, you're just having a bad dream, it was just a dream. - David? - Who's David. You're home. - No, he was here. He was here with me. - No honey nobody else is here. - The Candyman has him. - Caroline, quit it. No, you don't understand. - The Candyman has him. - Cut it out, you've been drinking. He told me so. That's it. I'm getting you some help. - I'm not crazy. - I didn't say you're crazy, but you need to talk to somebody. - You just need some help. - It was the Candyman. He is real. The Candyman does not exist. You said so yourself. I was wrong? Here... David couldn't have left. These are the keys to his... - Tamara! - What? Surrender... There is no reason... to live. God... Oh God! One last chance... Where is de la Paz? I told you. It was the Candyman... Hey! Sam... Head down and move to the center of the car. Just relax, Sam. Jesus... Get a sense of humor. Where are you taking me? Los Angeles police station, Boyle Heighst division. I didn't kill her. I know. It was your uncle. No, no, no, no, no... your grandfather. Or maybe it was, huh... your mother. Annie Tarrant? That's right. We did a little background check on you. New Orleans P.D. was very cooperative. Seems your whole family was obsessed with the Candyman. They'd be real proud of you. It was him. He is real! Ho, oh, oh shit! - What? - Candyman. Are you ok? Help me someone! Help me someone! They won't... believe you. Oh God... - Ain't done nothing. - Come on over. I cannot oblige you... to die. You alone must decide your fate. But surrender to me,... and talk of your death... will live on the lips... of the faithful... forever. My congregation will whisper your name... in reverence. Thoughts of you will stir fear in their hearts. Your memory... shall be... immortal. My altar... awaits your sacrifice. You must... come... to me. I will grant his life... for yours. La migra... No, I'm not immigration. It's Caroline. Open up! Abuela, please. David's in trouble, Abuela. Please. Can I use your bathroom, please? That way. My God... Cristina... come here now. Our Father, who art in heaven... who art in heaven... hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done. Abuela... Excuse me. I'm... I'm sorry, I... I need your help. Go to the next room. Hurry, later. Drink. Evil.. cannot exist... without good. Without one there is no other. Nothing left. You must destroy... the good. Without the good... the evil will die. There will be nothing... left. "The good"? I don't understand, Abuela. You... must find the good. What is his... good? The paintings. You guys... Check De la Paz' apartment. Let's go. Let's move it! It's Tino... He's looking for papi. Who is this? It's Caroline. I... was with David last night. Well, look... You know that gang you were looking for? It's not what you think. I got one of them here. You want him? Yeah. Tino, don't let him go anywhere. He ain't going nowhere. He wants to talk to you. - Ok. Where is my papi? Don't let the Candyman take him away... Oh Cristina, I won't. Don't worry. Open up... Police. Cristina, I need another way out of here. I know. The back door. Come on. Open up... Or I'll break the door down. Open the door. I just saw the Coroner's pictures on that guy Sacco. Somehow, this chick gets out of the cuffs... and rips the guy twice her size to shreds. Gives a whole new meaning to P.M.S. That's it. Go and do your own damn job. Go find her. Spread out and find her! Shit! Caroline... Give yourself to me! Just like your mother did. It's ok, honey. I'm here. Move! Get out of my way! Move it! Come on! Move it out. Move it out. Get out of my way! Move it! Move! Turn around! Put your hands on your head! Where is she? Where, the fuck, is she? Tell me where she is! Back off, Kraft! Get away from me, boy. Shit. Nice shot. Get his drunk, racist ass, the fuck, out here now! Get him outta here. Get him outta here. All right, spread out. I want her found now! Tino... the skinny huera again. Is this the chick? Yes. Where are paintings? I'll take you to them. Don't you, fucking, worry. I'll take you to them right now. Some sick shit's been happening, you know. Take you there right now. You can take them, the fuck, away. Hey huerita! You be careful. Chingado crazy. Right here. They're all there and the're all yours. Take them. I'm glad you can make it. Look, there's papi. You said you wouldn't let the Candyman take my papi. No... Somebody is awake... I got you. Fooled you, didn't I? You and that fat mexican fuck. You didn't know, did you? None of you did. I brought you here... to him! Him! Tonight we HONOR him. It's the Day of the Dead. We had an epiphany... at the gallery. His myth... called to us. A reflection of the evil... that created him. He came back... - to shed innocent blood. - What's blood for... if not for shedding... Poetry... We... are his new congregation. Believers... of his myth. We will keep the myth alive... ...so others will believe. We are the faithful. You're responsible for bringing him to us. If there wasn't for his art, we would've never known his pain... Called his name. Do you dare... call his name? Candyman. Candyman. Candyman. Candyman. Candyman. He's here. Candyman. Believe... Come to me... His life... for yours. Be... my victim. You took them. You took them! You took everything from me! My family! My mother! I hope you burn in hell! Take my shield... for one little fuckup. One little fuckup! You know... I'll fucking show 'em. I'll show those fucking assholes. David? David! God. I'm here. What has he done to you? David... I'm going to get you help. I need your help. Caroline... Your life... for his. You cannot fight it, Caroline. Caroline... see... what the've taken from me. Feel... my pain. Be... my... victim. Come to me... Do not fear the pain. It will be but momentary. In death there will be release... peace. Our legends will be forever remembered. Written on the walls. Immortality... shall be yours. The last of my descendants... will finally be with me. At last... I will have... what was taken from me so many... many years ago. My dignity... my destiny... my blood. Behold... your end. Noo! Caroline. Caroline. Do not forsake me... Caroline. Caroline! Do not betray me! Caroline! Don't move. I'm gonna get some help. Where am I? You're going to be ok. Everythings gonna be ok. Look at you... You disgust me. Making nice to the wetback. After you cut him up. You don't understand. Oh, I understand. I understand you're a twisted little bitch. You don't understand. I'm gonna split you open from groin to gullet. Don't do this; it was the Candyman. I'm the Candyman. Miss McKeever? Miss McKeever, you ok? All right. Just relax. Candyman. You must destroy the myth. Kraft was the Candyman. It was him. After an exhaustive year-long internal investigation... the department has come to the conclusion... that lieutenant detective Samuel Deacon Kraft, an officer with a long history... of psychiatric and disciplinary problems, was solely responsible for the serial homicides... now dubbed "The Candyman murders". They all blame someone else for your crimes. I destroyed you. Your good and your evil. There's nothing left. There's no proof of your existence. I destroyed the myth. No one will ever call your name again. There's no such thing as the Candyman.
