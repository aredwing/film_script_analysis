Rock-a-bye baby On the treetop When the wind blows The cradle will rock When the bough breaks The cradle will fall And down will come baby Cradle and all Let me finish your nightmare, kid. What's your status? Is SWAT here yet? Secure your perimeter. - What are you waiting for? - SWAT team. They'll be all night. Take the stairs. We got smoke in here. It's him. Go. - Don't shoot. Please. - Anybody else in there? - No. - Chris, get them downstairs. - Move. - Go. - Get them out. - Check it. Jake, we gotta wait for the fire trucks. - Absolutely. - Shit. Get the windows open. Go on. Come on, move it. Come on, baby. Come on. Jake! Jake! Jake! Go! - Come on, baby. - Jake. I'm okay. Get out of here. Okay. Okay. Hey, what in the hell are you doing? It's okay. Come on, take the baby. Get him to the hospital... ...make sure he's okay. Suspect's a white male headed north on Hauser on foot... ...wearing a black leather coat. Hold it there. Stop the bus. Stop the bus. Open up. What's going on? Sorry, folks. Just a routine check. Nothing to be alarmed about. What's going on? Sorry for the inconvenience. Everybody up, against the window. Don't look at me. Freeze! Be afraid, Jake. Be very afraid. Bye-bye. Across the street. - A couple uniforms here. - Okay, folks, stand back. - Get those photographers back. - Come on, guys, step it up. Behind the yellow line, I said. Come on, get the whole truck. Grab that guy coming in on the south side over there. What happened? - Let them through. - Oh, jeez. Take that back up. Almost had him. I had him. Yeah, well, that's not your problem anymore. As of an hour ago, you're officially retired. I know. Hey, make sure when they find the car, they check for blood, okay? Jake, shut up, okay? It's not your case anymore. Well, I popped him one. Check for blood. You just couldn't leave quietly, huh? You know, Howe, I wanted one last inspiring lecture from you. Ten years, buddy, you heard them all. A lot of good it's done. But, hey, before you go, the feds are here. They wanna talk. To me? Of course they do. - Gentlemen. - Jake. - Stan Reisman. How are you? - Fine. - What do you want? - I understand you're leaving the force. That's right. We'd like to offer you a job. No, thanks. Don't need one. We can help you catch him. He will kill again. Last night, "the Torch" claimed his 11th victim. This elusive serial killer has remained at large for over three years... ...preying on mothers throughout the Seattle area. Detective Jake Riley, who has headed up the case... ...had this to say about the Torch. How does it feel to be leaving with the case unsolved? - No comment. - Has he called you yet? - No comment. - Is this brilliant killer... ...the reason you're quitting? - I'm retiring for personal reasons. - The case has nothing to do with it. - Give us something. Yeah, I'll give you something. It turns out that our big, bad boogeyman... ...is nothing more than a bed-wetting mama's boy. That's right, he pisses himself all the time. Pathetic, really. Just a sick pervert. Is that enough for you? Did you get that? - Did we get that? - Did you get that? Pam, you naughty old thing. Jake. - Jacob, darling, telephone for you. - Oh, thanks, Ma. Yeah? That was a nasty thing you said about me on TV, Jake. Oh, yeah? Well, you're just a little too sensitive. I don't want you to call me anymore. I'm retired. You can quit, but you'll never get rid of me. I'm too smart. Yeah, mommy must be proud of her little psycho. Stop it, Jake. Look at yourself. Three years trying to catch me, but you failed. You're a bad cop. Do you think quitting will stop me? I'm going to keep on killing, asshole. You're a real loser. Hey, fuck you, you fucking prick! I'm gonna track you down like a fucking dog. You understand, you son of a bitch? Fuck you. Fuck you too, Jake. It's always the same m.o., with slight variations. Single mother, mole. Burns them postmortem. We got partial prints, trace evidence, blood type even... ...but still, no Torch. - No shit. Tell me something I don't know. We fed enormous amounts of data on the Torch... ...into our Vicaps supercomputer. We've come up with a white male, 30s, very physical. Step up to the mark. Welcome, Jacob Riley. The Martuchi slayings a year ago? We found a hair follicle belonging to him. It was enough for a DNA imprint on him. Take a closer look. Okay, so this is a clone of the killer. No, a replicant. God created man in six days, we took longer. - Since when has the FBI been...? - We're not FBI... ...we're National Security Force. We really don't care about your serial killer. Originally, this was developed for national security: Counterterrorism. Today's intelligence has failed to weed out terrorists. Okay, go on. Our goal is create replicants that can lead us to them. I understand. He's not a terrorist though. No, but the behavior patterns are similar. So why me? Because he picked you. What do you mean, he picked me? When he's ready, you'll take custody. You'll care for him, help him develop. Then you'll see if he can lead you to the killer. Wouldrt it be easier to plaster his face all over TV? No, no. This project is classified. No pictures, no conventional techniques, detective. All you have is Replicant. - What's going on? - Counterreaction. He's rejecting the latest growth hormone. Talk to me. What can we do? Defib. Flatline. Get him out. Now. Welcome to my world, motherfucker. Good morning, Number 1. Time to wake up. Today we're going to cover the basics: How to sit, stand, walk and stop. Now I'm walking. I'm sitting. I'm standing. I'm Miss Johnson. How are you? Oh, did you hurt yourself? Maybe your golden boy's retarded. Physical readings are normal, but the brairs sine waves are low. Well, we've enanced his telepathic ability through genome re-sequencing. He may be our first... ...but genetic memory has been scientifically proven. He just needs human stimuli. That's the toilet. And that's where you come in. First human contact. Good try. Watch the video and try again. - Impressive, isn't he? - He's exceeding expectations. You guys are pretty happy with yourselves, aren't you? You have no idea what you're getting into here. I've seen what he's able to do, firsthand, to 11 women. And if this thing turns out to be anything like the original... ...we're gonna regret it. Well, at the end of the day, Replicant is disposable. Take it easy. Food. Eat. I'm Jake. It's okay. There you go. You like that? How about this? How's that? Hey, here. Here, here. Yeah. Okay. Here, here. Look at that. You like that? Strong, huh? Easy, easy. Take it easy. No. Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy! Easy! Hey! Back up! Back off! Easy! Back! Back! Now, sit! Sit! I'm standing. I'm walking. I'm sitting. Standing. I'm walking. I'm sitting. - I'm stand... - Stay. No. Walk. Move. Let's go. Give me your glasses. Those are $500 sunglasses, detective. Yeah? Hey, look. Good. Thank you. Do I get an owner's manual on this guy or what? You do whatever it takes to awaken the killer inside. Here are your temporary NSF papers, and your gun. - Got it. - I want a report every 12 hours. Okay. Let's go. Walk. Walk. Come on. Sit. Sleeping killer. How sweet. We got company. Okay, freak of science, let's talk a little shop here, shall we? What do you remember, huh? Hey. What do you remember? Come on. You a killer? Feel like killing? Killing somebody other than a woman? Show me how you did it. Show me how you did it. Come on. Show me. Show me how you fucking did it. Remember that? Take it. Here. Wanna kill me? Here's your chance. Do it. Drop the gun! Oh, Three Stooges to the rescue. Stay calm. Do not shoot the subject. Jake, tell him to back off. No, just shoot him. Kill him. Goddamn it, Jake. Okay, okay, boys. Take it easy. Maybe if you put your guns down, he'll do the same. That's good. You deliberately jeopardized a classified project. We're taking him back. Good riddance. He's useless. Get out of there. Come on. I got him. Jake. Jake. Jake. - Yeah, very nice. - You broke my arm! Shouldrt have showed him the move. No. No. Hurts, don't it? Freeze. Freeze! Hey! No, no. Billion-dollar project. No shooting, remember? Put it away. That's it. Put it away. Stay. No. No. Stay. Here. Sit. Stay. Good. I'll call you a cab. Walk. Walk. Yeah, hi. I'd like to make an appointment... ...to see the house on Berkeley. My name is Jake Riley. - Drop the gun. - Oh, no problem. - Shut up. - Excuse me? No. Sorry. - No, it's the radio. - Oh, I see. - Half-hour. - Yeah. Great. Thank you. You know this place? A year ago, you made it the most famous house in the country. Real messy. Come on, get back. Calm the fuck down, you hear me? Calm the fuck down. Okay, let's go. It's just rain. Come on. How about this weather? - Jake Riley? Wendy Wyckham. - Wendy. Wendy Wyckham. Calm the fuck down. No. Sorry. My cousin Ronny, he's a little special. Let me show you in. Be good. Come on. This house was built in 1926. All the woodwork is original. Nice cozy fireplace here makes the entrance that much more special. Over here we have a spacious living room. This... This way. And we go into the kitchen which has recently been remodeled. All the marble, of course, imported from Florence. And over here we have the dining room. - It's perfect for entertaining. - Stay. What line of work did you say you're in? I was in law enforcement. That's right. You... You're that TV cop, the Torch case. I feel so much better. You know the history of the house then. Yes, I do. You know, it's such a shame, because most people can never get past it. But it is a steal. Way below market value. Is he okay? Could you give us a minute, please? Absolutely. Let's go. Walk. Let's go. This way. Come on. What do you remember? What? What is it? What do you see? Has he been here before? In another life. Let's go. No, Mommy, I don't wanna go home. I want to go to the park. No. Johnny, stop it. You're a bad boy. - Jake. - How you doing, kiddo? - Good. - Come on. Come on. Here, jump up. Up you go. - How you been, huh? - Good. - You been a good boy? - Yeah. Up you go. - How's things going? - Good. - Mommy's making your favorite. - Oh, I like that. - Go give Mommy a hug for me. Go. - Okay. Be good. Danny, go on upstairs, and take Scout with you. - Okay. - Okay? Scout, come. Come on. Sit. Down. You wanna tell me what the hell's going on? It's classified. If I told you, I'd have to kill you. That's not funny. Sorry, I know. Listen, I need your help. I gotta get a rendering of this guy as soon as possible. I'm not gonna do that for you. That's against department policy, remember? That's why it's considered a favor. That's gross. Don't eat that. That's for doggies. Here, try this. Want some more? You're supposed to say "thank you." What? Oh, my God, Danny, what happened? - Oh, God! - Baby, what happened? Come here! Get up! Look at me, you psycho freak! What did you do to him? Scout hit me in the tooth. - It was Scout? - What did you fucking do to him? Wait a second. Jake! Jake, stop! It wasnt him. Scout knocked his tooth out. It was the dog. It wasnt him. What happened? I kicked the shit out of him. Honest mistake. It's been 18 hours, Jake. You've gone AWOL, let him attack my men... ...and now you're telling me you've mistreated my replicant? Perhaps I made an error in judgment. Perhaps you did. Perhaps you should take your experiment and go. I don't need your shit. After what the Torch said to you, I thought you'd really want to nail him. How the hell do you know what he said to me, huh? You got my place wired, is that it? How the hell did you know where we were today? - You tracking us too? - You think we'd let you walk out with... ...the future of our national security without knowing everything about you? I expect a report every 12 hours, Jake. No exceptions. Jacob, is that you? Yeah, it's me, Mom. It's me. Here you go. Get your clothes off. Yes. That's it. Good. Stay. Stay. Come here. Come here. Okay, where is it, huh? It's not in the car. Too obvious, isn't it? Let's see. Internal? Is that it? Open. Internal tracking device. Oh, they think they're smart. They think they're real smart, don't they? Internal. Smart, isn't it? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Calm down. What...? What are you doing? I'm working, Mom. It's okay, it's okay. It's not what you think. Here. Okay. Let's go, Mom. Jacob. - What? - Jacob, that man was beaten up. Mom, you don't even know the guy, okay? Relax. Wait a minute, Jacob, I'm talking about you. - Jesus. - What is the matter with you? - What has happened? - What's wrong with you? Why are you treating people like that? Mom, just stop, please. Okay. But you remember one thing: If you treat people like criminals, that is exactly what they will become. Your dinner's in the fridge. I'm going home. Thank you. I can't take it. You and that boy have ruined my life. No! Mama, no! Where are you? Bad, bad boy. You must be punished. You're a bad mother. Hey, you all right? Hey, leave her alone. - Oh, God, please, no. - What's the problem? Easy, man. Thanks for the favor. I owe you one now. Forget about it. Right here. Stay. Subject loaded. Okay, let's see what you remember, huh? How about this one, yeah? Remember that one? - Come on. Come on, talk to me. - Okay, the picture's scanned. Make it snappy, all right? Hey. Sit down. Go on, sit. Edward Garrotte. Edward Garrotte, outstanding. Emigrated from South Africa in 1995. - Jake. - Hey, captain. How's the market? Well, oil prices are down. Now, what the hell are you doing back here? Just cleaning up some files. All done now. - You jerking me around? - No, no, no. Gotta go. - "You're jerking me"? - Shut up. Son of a... Stay. Let's go. Jake. Jesus Christ. Next victim. Keep it. Jake, we have an illegal entry. This is one sick puppy. The Torch. You got him. That's him in the car. No. I'll explain later. Jake, I gotta call this one in. Hey, you. - Back off. Back off. - Jake! Jake! - Jake! - Get out! Go, go! Get out, get out. - Get out of the way. - What happened? Come on, you guys, come on. Call for help. Are you okay? Where is he? He knew. There's more up here, guys. Come on, hurry up. Jake! Jake! What the hell's going on? - Tell me what is going on. - Not now. I'm gonna lose him. That's the Torch. You've got the Torch. No, it's not him. He's the key. I gotta find him. Jake, wait a minute. Jake! Who the fuck are you? Hey, break it up. Back off. No more phone calls. Who are you? What do you want? What...? What do you want? You asshole. - I lost him. - Watch where you're walking here. How is he? Angie. - How is he? - You've been lying to me. Gunfire reported at Martini's Lounge, 9th and Renfrew. Caucasian male, black leatherjacket. Any units in the area... That's two blocks away. There was two guys, and they were fighting... ...and then they shot my boss. They just took off. - Calm down. - Two guys, they're identical twins. - And they were fighting. - Okay, stay here. The janitor said that it was two identical twins fighting. Identical twins. Go, straight. - Yeah? - Hey, I'm proud of you. You're alive. Who is he? You're so smart, figure it out for yourself. Oh, I will. It will be my biggest challenge yet. Watch where you're going. Hey, buddy. Go on, beat it. Get out of here. Yeah, you. Get out of here. - Hello, Jake. How's my replicant? - Fine. Shits and pisses in the toilet and wants to get laid. Hasnt killed anybody yet, though. You know what I mean. Yeah, I do. And, yeah, something's happening. - I think he's remembering stuff. - Excellent. What can we do to accelerate the process? Nothing. He's doing fine just on his own. But I've chosen a different approach. - Yeah? What's that? - What, you don't know? You don't know where we are right now? I mean, aren't you still tracking us? 4901 Lasalle. That's the red-light district, Jake. That's right. Hey, baby, what's the hurry? Like what you see? Hey. Let's take a walk. Come on. Make yourself comfortable. Okay. Yeah. Kiss me. Yes. Yeah. Okay.

Hey, let's say it never happened, okay? Go. Come on, go. Stop it. Stop it. Go. We got a problem with payment? I'm here to collect. Just leave him alone. - He doesn't know what he's doing. - Shut up. You like this guy or what? You know the fucking rules, don't you? Don't you? I've had enough. I've had enough. Stop it! Leave him alone. Please. Police! Don't move! - Get down! Freeze! - Don't shoot! - Get down now! Get down! - He didn't do anything. Paul, and you men, hey! Easy, boys, easy, boys. Come on, man. - What's going on here? - It's okay. He's with me.

Gotta be a tourist or something. Shit. Is she next? - Look at this picture. - Is she next? Is she next? Rock-a-bye baby On the treetop When the wind blows The cradle will rock When the bough breaks The cradle will fall What do you see? Me kill. Jake, who am I? You are a genetic double. Genetic double. Yeah. I don't understand it either, buddy... ...but the other half, he's a killer. No, no. Hop in. It's all yours. Feel good? Good. Ice cream. There you go. You gotta do me a favor here. Would you look at that? You know that girl? What are you thinking? Here, here, here. No. Here. Draw up here. That's good, right there. Good to see you again, Nancy. I don't know. House, church, what? Go on. I got it. I know. I know. Pardon me. Can you tell me if she's staying here? Excuse me? Is she a guest at the hotel? - Who are you? Police? You have ID? - It doesn't matter who I am. - I think she's in danger. - I'm sorry, sir... ...but hotel regulations strictly forbid me to... Excuse me? Sir, you're not permitted upstairs unless accompanied by hotel staff. Okay, I understand that. I'm calling security. Get out. Get out. Stay. Shit. Open the door. Come on, come on, come on. Give me that. - Make your call. - We have a fire at 1404. I repeat, we have a fire at 1404. Here. Go. - Is he close? - Close. Hey. What are you doing? Get back. Get over here and open the door. Open the door, damn you! Open the frigging door! Open the door! Hey! Son of a bitch. Hey! Get back here and open the door now! Get over here! Stop it! Get over here right now! Get back here, you ass! Son of a bitch. Damn it. You received my message. What are you? Genetic double. A clone. Un-fucking-believable. Fantastic. Beautiful. My exact replica. We are the same. Same? Yeah. My body is your body. My mind is your mind. My life is your life. But, my brother, Jake cannot be trusted. He's going to kill you. I'll protect you, my brother. Brother. God, you son of a... Where are you? Hey! - We are identical. Identical. - Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Move! What the hell? You let him get away! We are the same. I should have shot you both! Goddamn you, he's screwing with your mind. Will Jake kill me? We're the same. Jake. Will Jake kill me? - We are the same. - Shut up! - Hey, Jake, are you on the case? - No. - Are you back on the force? - I'm retired. Can you tell us anything better than that? This is an individual who refuses to take responsibility. As far as I know, he's not taking responsibility. - He's a fucking nutcase, that's all. - Jake... Yeah, I've been waiting for you to call. I know. How's your whiskey? - It's fine. - How's my replicant? He's good. Put us on the speakerphone. - Why would I want to do that? - We can talk like family. I want both of you to hear me. Go ahead and talk. I want him to know how much I love him... ...what it means to me to have him in this world. How nice. Psycho love. So do you want to know who's my next victim? Ask my brother. Jake. So, what are you waiting for? In time, Jake. In time. Give me a reason, I'll blow your fucking head off. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. - Dr. Jim Towne, dial 211. - Oh, hello, Mr. Savard. Hi, Carol. How's Mama today? Oh, well, she's had better days. Maybe you can cheer her up. - I got a surprise for her. - Oh, good. Dr. Lerner, please return to the fifth-floor Intensive Care. And this one, I cut her good. Very slow. I wish you were there. She was begging, screaming. Bad boy! You've got to be punished! Bad boy! But you know what? I did it for you. You bad... - Boy! - Please, Mom, no. You've got to be punished! No. No. Help. Help. No more, you bitch. No more. You should never have been born, Luke Savard! Luke Savard. Jake, I got it. Luke Savard. Jesus, talk about a bad boy. Shoplifting at 11... ...grand theft auto, narcotics, arson. He enlisted in the Corps in '88. Reportedly killed behind enemy lines in June of '91... ...but the body was never recovered. Oh, and I tracked down his mother: Gwendolyn Savard. She was committed to the nepenthe home six years ago after a stroke. And, Jake, one other thing, this woman killed her husband. She locked the kid up in a closet and then set the house on fire. Luke Savard only lived because it rained that night. Dr. Stan Getty to room 205. Mr. Savard? We tried to call you last night. - He was here last night? - Of course. I'm sorry. Your mother... ...she had a sudden cardiac arrest. We did everything we could. She was just too frail. Her things. Excuse me. - May we see the body? - Oh, yes, of course. Take it easy, Jake. Want her to die, do you? Your gun, drop it. Drop your gun. Good. You're not so smart. You never saw me coming. This is it, Jake. You're going to die. So what's the matter, Jake, huh? No smart comeback? No reporters to joke with. He's not your family. He doesn't care about you. But I do. That's why I want you with me. I have an idea. You're gonna kill him. Do it. Finish him. Yeah. No. That's why you're gonna die with him, and they'll think you are me. You're a bad boy, Luke Savard. What did you say? You're a bad boy, Luke Savard. You killed Mama. Yes, that's right. And so what? It felt good. You bitch! Okay. You're gonna be okay. - You're gonna be okay. - Okay. Stay right there, don't move. I'll be back. There he is. What are you doing? Get inside! Wait, wait! - Where is he? - He's down there. Easy now. Hi, sweetheart. Get inside! Rock-a-bye baby On the treetop When the wind blows The cradle will... Hey, not bad for a mama's boy, huh? Should I call the news now or later? Stop it. If you kill me, you kill yourself. The safety, Luke Savard. What makes you think you can take me, huh? I can read your mind. No! No! Look at me. Come on. Come on, buddy. - Hey, look at me. - Jake... ...my family's gone. Hey. Hey. He's not your family. Hey. I'm your family. I'm your family now. Jake, I see rain. In my eyes, I see rain. No! Open up! Open the door! Open the goddamn door! Well, the only ones who made it were the corpses in the fridge drawers. I expect a full report. - Back it up, back it up. - Right there. Move it. Go ahead and let this guy go. I'm in first. You may be in first, but I'm better than you. - No. - No, no. I'm in first. - Who's the best? - Me. No. I beat him. I beat him. Whoa, hey. - You see the deliveryman? - No. Let's go. Let's go get it. Come on. He likes rain. - Hi. - Hi. I knew you'd come back. Let's get out of here. Let's go.
