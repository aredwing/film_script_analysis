It ends tonight. We must move quickly, before they turn. Is he still here? Yes. iktor, he must not be harmed. I gave you my word, did I not? But William must be controlled. Burn the bodies. Search the outbuildings. Form two groups. You, douse them with fuel. -Yes, sir. -Marcus. Stay with me. Give me the torch. They're turning! They're turning! -Retreat to the woods. -I'll stay and fight. You need my help. I need you alive. If you die, we all die. Now, go. Go! -We found him. -And? -We need more men. -Find Amelia. Amelia, we found William. Surround him! Take him down. No. Leave him be. Stop this, you're killing him. More! William. Marcus! He was not to be harmed. Place him in my charge as we agreed... ...or you will pay for your deceit. And you will learn your place. Your sympathy for this beast is foolish. Your brother is entirely beyond control. It will be done my way. You know well the consequences if you murder me... ...or William. If you so much as speak his name again... ...you will have chosen that future for him. What is thy will, my lord? Imprisonment for all time. Far from you. For six centuries I was a loyal soldier of the Vampire clan. But I was betrayed. The war was not as it had seemed. In one night, the lies that had united our kind had been exposed. Kraven, our second-in-command... ...had formed a secret alliance with Lucian... ...ruler of the Werewolf clan... ... to overthrow Viktor, our leader. But Kraven's lust for power and domination had failed. Viktor was not the saviour I had been led to believe. He had betrayed us all. Soon the hunt will be on for his killer. I have but one ally left: Michael... ... the human descendant of Corvinus. Neither Vampire nor Lycan... ...but a hybrid. It's only a matter of time before we're found. My only hope now is to awaken Marcus... ... our last remaining elder... ...and expose the truth... ...before Kraven tries to murder him while he's still in hibernation. Kraven knows he's no match for him awake. Perfect. This thing's been dead for weeks. I thought Lycans went back to their human form when they die. They do. It's been given a serum to stop regression... ...so it can be studied. How can you tell? Not quite your department, I guess. I just killed them. I didn't pay much attention to their anatomy. -How long can we stay here? -Not long. These safe houses are linked together on one mainframe... ...with motion sensors revealing which ones are active. Someone could have picked us up already. There's only about an hour till daylight. Can you make it back to the mansion before sunrise? -Just. -Okay, let's get what we need and go. No. I'm going alone. Open it. Marcus? The blood memories of this wretched creature... ...have shown me that your treachery knows no bounds. My lord, I can explain. Why would I listen to your lies... ...when the journey to the truth... ...is so much sweeter? I kept his secrets, cleaned up the mess. You'll go before Viktor... ...and tell him exactly what I tell you to! You just concentrate on your part. Please. I can assist you. Oh, you already have. If I can plead my case... ...there's a chance you'll be granted sanctuary. Now, you'll be killed on sight. I'm not prepared to risk it. What should I do, wait? Kraven may still have men with him. You're not going alone. You're not as strong as you might think. -What? -Michael, you're unique. There's never been a hybrid before. However ambivalent you feel about it, your powers could be limitless. But you depend on blood. You need to feed. Without it, you'll be growing weaker by the second. Use the time for that. Jesus Christ. And what if I don't? What if I can't? Normal food could be lethal. If you don't anticipate your cravings, you will attack humans. And believe me, you don't want that on your conscience. There really is no going back, Michael. I'm sorry. Look, I understand what you did. I'm grateful. You saved my life. I wasn't ready to die. I don't know. Everything's changed. I probably need a minute to make it all fit in my head. It's a lot to process all at once. Look, go. I'll be here. You just make sure you come back. Sir. The innocent who witnessed... ...they've been silenced? But otherwise unharmed, as ordered. -Show me what you have. -Yes, sir. Two Death Dealers were killed. We found no Lycan bodies. Apparently they were using a new kind of ammunition... ...some sort of UV round. Amelia? No one survived. It seems Kraven's men might have been present... ...but they did nothing to prevent it. And Viktor? And no trace of Marcus amongst the ashes? It seems he destroyed his own coven, sir. It was never his coven. We need to go. Give me a moment. There you are. How you doing? Thank you. You've got to get away from me. Get away from me! Hello? There. Michael Corvin. Get the men up there. Now. Get the fuck away from me. Stop. Stop. Shit. Michael. Oh, shit. -Here. Take it. -No. Michael, you'll die. Shit. Can you move? We need to go. Marcus. I know what you've done, Selene. Viktor deserved his fate and Kraven was no better. Kraven has already reaped the rewards of his own misdeeds. And Viktor.... Viktor deserved his fate... ...many times over. A terrible business... ...the slaying of your family. Yet so much effort was spent... ...to conceal this matter from me. What do you suppose Viktor had to hide? Or perhaps it is you, Selene... ...as the last of your wretched family... ...who has something to hide. Go! Get in. Dead or alive, you will give me what I want. You okay? -He's a hybrid, isn't he? -Yes. He wanted this. Why? I don't know. But we have another problem. Turn off up here. Shit. All right, get down. Keep your foot on the gas, but stay down. Hold on. Stay down. Come on. Give me your hand. Jesus Christ. There's really no need. I'll be right back. All right, let me see. See? No need. Area secure, sir. Sun's setting. What's wrong? The supplies were taken. Used weapons were left behind. The tavern events occurred before dawn, so they couldn't have got far. Remain airborne for the moment. I'm sure they'll reappear... -...in good time. -Yes, sir. I've seen this before, when I was a child. I've held it. When it was open, like this. How is that possible? I don't know. But I know someone that might. Andreas Tanis. He was the official historian of the covens. He fell from favour after documenting what Viktor considered malicious lies. Of course, as it turns out, he was probably telling the truth. What happened to him? He was exiled over 300 years ago. Three hundred years? What makes you think we'll find him now? I was the one who exiled him. Looks like a monastery. It used to be. More like a prison now. Tanis has been hiding there since Viktor's order. We'll be the first people he's seen in centuries. -That's odd. -What? I don't remember this gate being here before. Take this. Shit. Go back! Gotcha. Fuck. I knew it was you, Selene. The stench of Viktor's blood still lingers in your veins. Tanis. I see your aim hasn't improved. You haven't changed. You don't scare me, Selene. Well, we're gonna have to work on that. We need to talk. Your exile seems a bit more comfortable than I remember. How does a Vampire have Lycan bodyguards? A gift. From a most persuasive client. Lucian. Why would Lucian wanna protect you? Because he was trading with them. UV rounds. How long have you been in the business of killing your own? I've done what's necessary to survive. My decision was made easy the day your precious Viktor betrayed me. Betrayal was something he did very well. Viktor's dead. I killed him. You? Kill Viktor? No, I think not. Oh, unless you've learned the truth. So your eyes are finally open. Isn't it interesting how the truth... ...is even harder to absorb than light? You know, I tried to stop him, of course. A travesty, committing such a horrible crime. And then turning you. That was too much to take. My protests are why he put me here. Careful with that, dear. Makes a terrible bang. Open the blades and they're active. Good to know. Viktor put you here for a reason, but I doubt it was... ...because you had moral qualms. -What do you know? -Very little of anything, I'm afraid. Well, then, perhaps I'm mistaken and there's no use for you at all. Marcus was after this. Why? Some history is based on truth... ...and others on deception. Viktor was not the first of our kind, as you were led to believe. He was once human... ...the ruler of these lands. Marcus... ...he's the one. The source. The first true Vampire. So the legend is true. Toward the end of his ruthless life... ...when the next breath meant more to Viktor than silver or gold... ...Marcus came with an offer... ...a reprieve from sickness and death. Immortality. And in return, Viktor was to use his army-turned-immortal to help him. To do what? To defeat the very first Werewolves... ...a dangerous and infectious breed... ...created by Marcus' own flesh and blood: His twin brother, William. But these weren't the Lycans we know. Disgusting though your brethren may be... ...they at least are evolved. No, these were raging monsters. Never able to take human form again. It was only later generations that learned to channel their rage. And William's appetite for destruction and rampage was insatiable. He had to be stopped. And so once Viktor's army was turned... ...the legions of Vampires under his control... ...tracked down and destroyed the animals... ...then captured William... ...and locked him away. Viktor's prisoner for all time. Why let him live? For the very same reason that Viktor never conspired against Marcus: fear. He was warned that, should Marcus be killed... ...all those in his bloodline would follow him to the grave. So in Viktor's mind... ...William's death would mean the end for all Lycans... ...his slaves. Yes. Yes, a clever deception... ...but one Viktor was hardly willing to put to the test. And so Marcus was protected... ...at all costs. Yes, here we are. -Vampires? -Mortals. Men loyal to Alexander Corvinus. The father of us all. What's this? You should know. It's William's prison. The prison your father was commissioned to build. So you've been the one keeping a watch over this for me, have you? I've been searching everywhere for this, my darling. What is it? What's wrong? She now understands why her family was killed. But that was many years later. The winter of Lucian's escape. Your father knew too much. Or too much for Viktor to risk... ...especially when Lucian... ...had the key to William's cell. And I'm the map. Yes. The only one still living who has seen its location. Oh, Viktor realized you'd be too young to remember explicitly... ...but Marcus knows that the memory... ...and therefore the exact location of William's prison... ...is hidden away in your blood. Why is Marcus looking for him now... ...after all this time? That I cannot answer. But I do know someone... ...who could stop him. Perhaps I could arrange a meeting. In exchange for your discretion, of course. Of course. Tanis. You seem anxious. Why do you flee the very sight of me? Please... ...sit. There's no need for this to be unpleasant. I've always rather enjoyed your company. Now you're being rude. Sorry. Viktor struck two keys. What do you know of them? Keys? I don't know of any keys. Oh, yes. Yes, those keys. -Yes? -Well, one was.... One was kept in plain sight... ...draped around his daughter's neck... -...right there for you to see. -And the other? -Kept with Viktor at all times. -Where? Within him. Beneath the flesh. Please. Please. I beg you. Please. Please, I beg you. --who could stop him. Perhaps I could arrange a meeting. Go to pier 17. Ask for Lorenz Macaro. How do we know Tanis isn't setting us up? He's not brave enough to set me up. You can go. You're familiar with this, then? Intimately. You're Alexander Corvinus. There was a time that I was known by that name. By any name, I am still your forefather. How have you stayed hidden all these years? For centuries I've stood by and watched the havoc... ...my sons have wrought upon each other and upon humanity. Not the legacy I prayed for... ...the morning I watched them enter this world. And a tiresome duty... ...keeping the war contained, cleaning up the mess... ...hiding my family's unfortunate history. -Couldn't you have stopped it? -Yes. Could you kill your own sons? You know what Marcus will do. If he finds me, he finds William's prison. You need to help us stop him. You are asking me to help you kill my son? You? A Death Dealer? How many innocents did you kill... ...in the six-century quest to avenge your family? Spare me your self-righteous declarations. You are no different from Marcus and even less noble than William. At least he cannot control his savagery. Anything I've done can be laid at your feet. Hundreds of thousands have died because of your inability to accept... ...that your sons are monsters, that they create monsters. You could've stopped all of this. Do not come grovelling to me... ...simply because you are weaker than your adversary. You know the devastation William caused before he was captured. He cannot be set free. Wa-- No, wait. You're no match for him. Soon, brother. No. Father. No. They've gone. There, there, my child. You are safe now. No. Michael. Look at me. Michael. Shit. Please. Please. Come on. Come on. Fuck. Hello, Father. You are unwelcome in my presence. The predictable heart that never thaws. Pity it beats within such a fool. The eldest of the immortals... ...yet you have made no attempt to seize your destiny. We are oddities of nature, you and l. Nothing more. This is a world for humanity. And that petty sentiment explains why you rejected your sons? Why you stood by for over half a millennium... ...as William suffered alone in darkness? No, Father. I have no respect for your petty sentiment. Viktor's key. Where is it? Whatever plan you have for William is futile. -You cannot control your brother. -Oh, I am stronger now. And our bond is greater than you have ever wanted to acknowledge. You're wrong. Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans, just like before. Oh, not Lycans, Father... ...or Vampires. A new race, created in the image of their maker... ...their new god: Me. And a true god... ...has no father. You will fail. -Get the kit. -No. Please, sir, let us help you. The time has come, my friend. Find the girl. Bring her to me. No, wait. Wait. If you want Marcus, you'll need Alexander's help. Don't leave him here. -Did he get the pendant? -Yes. He's too powerful for you alone. You are the only one older than he is... ...the only one stronger. You could have killed him yourself. No matter what he's become... ...he is my son. You are the last hope left. There is only one way to defeat him. Quickly, now... ...before there is no more legacy left in my veins. What will I become? The future. Go now. We're getting close. Head back around towards the river. I don't see a way inside. There used to be a river entrance just there. It must be submerged now. Looks like we're getting wet. Closer. Selene. William. Wait. No, William. Stop. Be still, brother. It's me. I'd no sooner harm you than myself. Which way? Is this it? He's already here. What is that? Nothing. Let's go. We're too late. -After him. -Get behind him. Impressive. Michael, you're unique. There's never been a hybrid before. Your powers could be limitless. Hold it! Oh, fuck. -Where is he? -He went right through there. All we have are UV rounds. They won't take him down. No, but they'll slow him down. Let's go. You all right? Jesus Christ! But these weren't the Lycans we know. No, these were raging monsters. Unable to take human form ever again. What are you waiting for? Shoot them. I can't. Not without taking her out. I can't get a shot. Michael. Take her down. Cut us loose! We're going down! William! I knew Viktor made a mistake by keeping you as a pet. He should have killed you with the rest of your family. An unknown chapter lies ahead. The lines that had divided the clans have now been blurred. Chaos and infighting are inevitable. All that is certain is that darkness is still ahead. But for now, for the first time... ...I look into the light with new hope.
