Besides, this is the first time in the history of this organization a rod's had to be used. You guys by pulling this thing you made Little John awful brokenhearted. Oh, boss, you shouldn't take that altitude towards us. The guy was chiseling in on us. Me and Philadelphia Powell caught him red-handed. Sure, everybody thought you'd be glad to have that guy illuminated. Oh, that ain't it. The job was pulled in Molly Madigan's. The police closed the joint. Now where's a guy gonna get a plate of corned beef and cabbage? Yeah, it was tough on Molly. Using her establishment for that there kind of work. A lot of people are funny like that. They don't wanna sit when that merchandise is being carried out. Besides, why wasn't I in on the know beforehand? We're partners. Why wasn't I given no memo? Lay off, will you? The guy's washed up, ain't he? You bet he's washed up. So is Molly Madigan's business, so is our record and so am I. - What do you mean? - You heard. I've been getting fed up on this business, I've been thinking of getting out. This latest transaction convinces me. - You don't know what you're saying. - I know exactly. I'm fed up on this business. I don't see no career in it no more. Besides, I'm too sensitive. Johnny, what are you gonna do? Plenty. I got my little bundle. I'm gonna retire, see? From now on, I'm going after the two things I've always wanted most. Good taste and refinement. I'm gonna get what I was born to have: Class. What kind of conversation is this? The guy's blown his roof off. Cut the clowning, the guys ain't in a mood. I ain't clowning. I'm on the level. I'm through with the rackets forever. From now on, the business is yours. I'm stepping out. Of course, without Little John, you're starting from scratch. But you'll get along. - You mean that, Johnny? - Absolutely. This is a kiss-off. Now, you guys are no longer looking at John Sarto, boss of the rackets. You're now looking at John T. Sarto... ...world sportsman, socialite and art student. - Where are you going, boss? - I'm gonna tell Flo. Then tomorrow, I'm off for London, Paris and St. Moritz... ...and with all the class that goes with them there joints. Willie, you can come and help me pack. So long, guys, I won't be seeing you. He's certainly going a long way to get class. The way he's going after it, he'll come back reeking with it. Well, don't worry, pal. He'll never come back. Look, Johnny. Don't it look elegant? Yeah, it's got class all right. Look, you dumb cluck, you got it pasted on the inside. Sure, it gets scratched on the outside. Anybody's smart enough to know that. Flo, sometimes you got me guessing whether you're even a nitwit. Okay, Johnny. That's the thanks I get for dropping in to help you pack. Oh, I'm sorry, baby. Look, I didn't mean I should hurt your feelings. I keep forgetting you don't catch on to class faster than I. Where do you want me to tuck these croquet mallets, boss? See what I'm up against? Not croquet, stupid. Them's polo clubs. - Won't they fit in the trunk? - Not a chance. Not even if I bend them. I got an idea, Johnny. Pinky Johnson at the Can-Can Club has a black bow fiddle case you can borrow. No good. Hop over to Can-Can. Ask Pink if he got a brown one he can let you have. - Okay. I wanna match my luggage. Nobody can say Johnny ain't in good taste. - Oh, you're always in good taste, Johnny. - Ha-ha. That's what's got me kind of jumpy. I mean, you and me tearing around Rome and all them places... ...and me with a maiden name. - I don't get you. I mean us taking this trip. Us? Who said we're taking the trip? Well, ain't we? Look, I don't wanna hurt your feelings but Little Johnny's gonna take this trip alone. - But you and me... - It wouldn't be proper now, would it? Besides... ...I kind of like to get away by myself for a little while. You understand? Sure. I understand. Oh, Flo. Why don't you come out and say it. Say you're tired of me and this is the blow off? Oh, baby, now how can you talk this way? How can you even think this way? Well, it is, ain't it? When you say that, it's like sticking a knife in me. When you look like you mean it, it's like breaking the handle off. Well, I can't help it, Johnny. You and me have been going together for five years now. - Of course I know you've been awful busy... - Is some woman been talking to you? But to me if a fella loved a girl enough he could take five minutes off... ...to hop over to the city hall and dig up some judge. Now, stop mentioning judges. - I'm superstitious. - Okay, Johnny. Forget it. Anyway, we had some good times together. Oh, now look, baby, I'm still nuts about you. We ain't married because we haven't got around to it. When I come back and I'm a gentleman, we're gonna have a big church wedding. Gee, and I ain't been in a church since the night your brother was bumped off. Oh, you're swell, kid. You know, you deserve the best. Oh, Johnny. I ain't forgetting you. I'm gonna take care of you. - Are you? - You bet your life. I was gonna do something big for you. - Now's the time. - Gee, Johnny. - You always wanna be in show business? - Do I? Well, watch. Get me Al Royer at the Crescent Club. I'll show how you stand. The Crescent Club? The biggest nightclub in town. Hello, Al. Little John Sarto. Oh, fine, pal. How's yourself? Say, listen, you know Flo Addams, don't you? My fiance. That's right. Well, look, I'm going off to Europe, see? While I'm gone I want you to spot her in your nightclub. That's right. You will? Well, that's fine, Al, I appreciate it. Yeah. She'll be over tomorrow afternoon at 2. Well, that's fine, pal. Thanks, pal. So long, pal. - Well, do I get into the club? - You bet your life. - Tomorrow afternoon you start as... - As what? Hatcheck girl. Oh, gosh, Johnny. See how Little John takes care of the people he likes, huh? Ha-ha-ha-ha. Oh, Johnny. - Goodbye, Johnny. - Goodbye, baby. Heh-heh. - So long. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I trust you had good luck, monsieur. - Hmm? - Heh. Oh. Here, pal. Better frame this. Last one from the biggest sucker in the world. Thank you, monsieur. - Oh, uh... Where's the nearest cable office? - Lobby of the hotel. Thanks. - Do you read English? - Certainly. That is my business. Well, then read that. "Monsieur Jack Buck, Willie the Kaniff... - Knife. - Oh, yes, "Willie the Knife... ...French Frank, Mugsy O'Day, Philadephia Powell... " Yeah, okay, okay. Read the message. "Good news, boys. I'm coming home to be your boss again. With the class I got now, we'll all make plenty of kopecks. Love and kisses, Little John Sarto. " Yeah, cross out the word kopecks. Put in mazuma. Oui, monsieur. Mazuma. - Yeah, that's better English. - Oh, oui, monsieur. Oh, by the way, where's the nearest hockshop? - Hockshop? - Yeah, hockshop. You know, pawnbroker. - Oh, pawnbroker. Oh, oui, monsieur. - Mm-hm. Go to the head doorman at the gambling casino. He has the concession. Yeah? I should have known that. What are your plans in the United States? Returning to business. Pressure was brung on me... ...so I skip over to the States, head my organization. - I see. - My board of directors are meeting me. - Oh, a little welcome home party? - Right. Pardon me, sir. They're ready for your baggage now. Thanks. Well, I'm sorry, you guys, but I have to skip now. - Thank you, Mr. Sarto. - The pleasure's all mine. Hi, Johnny. Boss. Welcome home. Johnny, you're a sight for sore eyes. Same goes for me. Glad to be back. - Where's Willie the Knife? - Had business to attend. - Let me take your baggage. - Got a car. - Let me take your arm. - Wait a minute, now. Take your foot off the gas. Where's Jack Buck? At the joint to welcome you. All the boys are waiting. Give me your baggage, I know a guy... Never mind about the customs. I got that fixed up already. - Where's the car? - A limousine parked outside. - Come on. Duck this crowd. - You don't mind this service? Mind? Boy, I love it. Push ahead there, will you? - And open up a path for me. - Ha-ha-ha. Johnny, will the boys be glad to see you. - Just like yesterday, huh, boss? - Oh, yeah. Ha-ha. Oh, uh... - Say, why ain't my name on there? - Well, we took it off when you quit, boss. Well, put it back on. Without my name on there, it ain't got no clat. Oh, that's a French word we use in France. It means pretty nifty. - Come in, boss. This is it. - Well, Johnny, welcome home. How are you? Finkie, how are you? How've you...? Well, say, look at that. Oh, this is grand. Heh-heh. Well, I sure appreciate the sentiment, boys. Ahh. Just like the good old days. Everything just the way I left it. Yeah, furniture, books, everything. Still there. Same old private apartment. Just the same. Well, sure looks good. Boy, remember some of the parties... ...we held in here, eh, pal? - Ha-ha-ha-ha. Yes, sir, Johnny. Those were the good old days. Come on in here. I want you to talk to the boys. - Sure. - I want you to take your old seat, up front. Certainly nice to be back with the old mob. - Mugsy? - Yeah? - Show the boss to his old seat. - A pleasure. Thanks, Mugsy. Ha-ha. - Here you are, boss. - Oh, boy. Oh, boy. This is what I've been looking forward to... The hot seat, huh? Now, who done it? Who's the wise guy? Come on now, speak up. - Lf you don't, I'll break every guy's head. - Relax, you ain't scaring nobody. - You know who you're talking to? - Little Johnny Sarto. You don't mean a thing. You might as well get this through your nut right now. You walked out on us five years ago and left us flat. You give me the rackets and made me the boss. You think I'm gonna be chump enough to step down now? Oh, so that's it. - Now I get it. - As far as the rackets are concerned... ...you're through, Johnny. Let me give you a little tip. You can stay around as long as you want to... ...but it'll be healthier if you leave. Because from now on, I ain't liking you and I'm liable to not like anything you do, see? A showdown, huh? All right, wise guy. Mugsy. Philadephia. Frank. Now, who's it gonna be, him or Little John? Come on, speak up. Who's your boss? What is this? - What am I doing, dreaming? - No, you ain't dreaming. The sooner you get it through your head that you're out of the business, the better. - Now, get out of here. - Why, you. Uhn! Go on. Throw him out on the street. - All right, wise guy. - Let me go. I'll get out but I'm coming back. I'm organizing a new mob and someday I'm gonna blast you right off the earth. - I'll show you yellow mugs... - Don't stand there. - Throw him out. - Hands off me. Get him out of here. Come on, get out. Get him out of here. All right, get out of here. - Here, now. - Huh? Where do you think you're going? Up to Miss Addams' apartment. I'm Little John Sarto. I don't care what size you are. You ain't going up to no Miss Addams' apartment. - Why not? - Because about eight months ago... ...Miss Addams upped and flew her fine feathers... ...over to the Parkway Biltmore. The Parkway Biltmore? - What'd she do, get a job as a maid? - I don't know. But it's been said she's doing real well. Yeah? Well, thanks. Ackers, Addison, Anderson, Appleby, Bassett, Bliss. No, there's no Miss Addams working here. Her landlady said she came eight months ago. Well, I'm sorry, buddy, but we ain't got no record of it. Hey, Al, you better step on it. Miss Addams wants to see them. - Okay. Okay. - Here. Just a minute. Addams? Could that be Flo Addams? No. This is Miss Florence Addams, a guest. Couldn't be the one you're looking for. Yeah? Well, I'm just crazy enough to go up and see. Here. Wait a minute. Tell Albert to drag them in. I ain't got time. Oui, madame. Oh, come in, Albert. Ha-ha! Napoleon. Ho-ho-ho. Oh, Fifi... Johnny. Oh. Oh, Johnny. Oh, never mind the hysterics. - Get rid of the audience. - You can go now. Take Napoleon and Josephine out. Me and Mr. Sarto wish to be alone. Oh, Johnny. Five years you've been gone. Gee, you don't know how I've missed you. Yeah. From the looks of things it's good I come back. What's that idea of all this layout? Well, you always wanted me to have class, didn't you? Yeah, but this joint's so full of it, it leaks. Don't tell me you got it selling cigarettes. - I ain't a cigarette girl no more. - You ain't? - When'd you quit the Crescent Club? - I didn't. - You didn't? - I own it. - What are you, kidding? - I bought Al Royer out a year ago. - With what, hay? - Alfalfa. That's what Clarence raises. Cla... Now, look, one of us is cuckoo. Now, let's start this over again. - Who's Clarence? - A big rancher from out West. He's interested in cows. Oh, yeah? Especially when they wear petticoats. If you're insinuating anything, you're mistaken. I ain't worn a petticoat in years. Well, from now on this cowboy's out of the picture, see? Tell him pack up his wigwam go back to the wide-open spaces. - You're jealous. - No, I ain't. I'm suspicious of a guy that looks for pastureland on 42nd Street. - Johnny. - What? You ain't kissed me yet. Well, I'll get around to that. First I got something important to do. Where's Willie the Knife? In Pattonsville. That's a private sanitarium, over in Jersey for mental disorders. Say, he's got his nerve going crazy just when I need him? He ain't crazy. He's playing at it to get away from Jack Buck. He quit him a couple of weeks ago. Jack Buck's a bad guy, Johnny. Yeah, I found out about that. But don't worry, he ain't gonna be much longer. Oh, hello, operator, get me the Pattonsville Sanitarium. That's right, New Jersey. All right, I'll hold on. There's a rumor Jack Buck don't like you no more. I confirmed it. That's why I gotta act quick. I don't think you'll get Willie. They're funny about guests. Oh, I'll get him all right. This is Little John Sarto. How long will it take us to where Willie's at? - Forty minutes. - Good. I'll tell him we'll pick him up. Maybe he won't wanna leave. He told me he's in a grand hideout... ...and having a swell time with his mental disorder. If he told you that they ought to keep him there. Oh, hello, Pattonsville? Let me talk to Willie Corson. Who am I? His grandfather. Who do you think? Just a moment. The phone, Willie. Your grandfather wants to talk to you. Go on, the phone. Don't keep Grandpa waiting. That's a nice boy. Okay, I'll bite. But sometimes I don't know who's being kept here. You guys or me. - Hello? Oh, listen, Flathead. - This is Little John Sarto. - Boss! I want you to pick up roscoes and if you grab a torpedo or two... Boss, you forget where I am. They're awful peculiar up here... ...and they get hurt if you walk out on a joint. Just leave a note and say that you, well, went to the store. - That'll take care of everything. - Of course, I ain't really wacky. I had meself put into the joint but the kiss-off may not be so easy. Listen, you leave everything to me, see? I'm back and I need you. I ain't got no time for no red tape. I'll be up to get you. Now, you be ready. All right, put a hat on. We're shoving off. - Well, I guess I don't. - Don't what? Don't get kissed. All right. It's broad daylight, but come on. Oh, Johnny. Mmm, mmm, mmm! Hey. This cowboy of yours. You sure you ain't been doing no rehearsing? - What do you mean? - The way you come at me. I don't know whether you're gonna hug me... ...or saddle me. - Ah, mm-hmm. Pardon, madame. Monsieur Fletcher is on the phone. Oh. That's Clarence. Wait a minute. Hello, Clarence. Say, where are you at? I reckon you're gonna be powerful mad at me. For being so late in phoning you. This morning I got so lonesome to see a cow... ...that I went over to Jersey to the stockyards. Whenever me and cows get together, time just don't mean nothing. Well, what about the curtain material? Well, say, I'm having mighty poor luck trying to match this here material for you. It seems like every store in town is just plumb out of it. Oh, well, let it go, Clarence. Where is your car? I wanna borrow it for a friend of mine. You'll do no such thing. Tell him to pack up and get out of town. Wait a minute, Clarence. Don't be a lug. He can drive. You and me sit in the back seat and talk. Who is this mug? Can he be trusted? Oh, sure he can. He's dumb but nice. You'll feel sorry for him. And he loaned me a lot of money. Tell him to get here quick and have plenty of gas in his car. Okay. Clarence, you get right over here and put plenty of gas in your car. You know what? You're gonna drive me and my boyfriend out in the country. You bet. That sure is nice of you. Gee, honey, it's nice to have you back. Now, that's the third time you've told me. You don't have to oversell it. - What's that whistling I hear? - That's Clarence making birdcalls. He's awful good. You wanna see him impersonate a robin? What'll he do, eat a worm? Johnny, you just don't like him. He's awful nice. You know what? He loaned me $ 10,000... ...to buy out the club and never asked for nothing. How'd you meet him? In a way any respectable lady would meet a perfect gentleman. He passed out in the club one night. What'd you do, hold his head? No, his wallet. But I'd give it back to him the next night. So you had to prove you was dumber than him, huh? Johnny, you're jealous and you don't have to be. He don't mean a thing. You're the only one who was ever in my life and ever will be. I'm sorry, baby, I think I know how you feel. - I'm gonna give you a chance to prove it. - How? - Do you love me? - Oh, do I? Then put that robe around my legs, will you? My ankles are getting cold. - Who's the guy driving for him? - I don't know. Do you know that guy, Mugsy? Some guy that's been hanging around the Crescent Club. They say Flo is the lull in his life. Oh, yeah? We better check up on him when we get back. You two wait here. I'll only be a few minutes. - How do you like Mr. Sarto, Clarence? - Oh, I like him fine. Sure makes me feel awful discouraged, though. Why? He's so nice and outspoken. Nothing put-on. That's what I like in him. I reckon so do the ladies. Well, they better not. Not while I'm around. Gee, it must be swell. - What? - For Mr. Sarto. Having a wonderful girl like you in love with him. - Oh, now, Clarence. - I mean it. I know how I'd be. You'll meet the right girl someday, Clarence. You just have to feel your way. All I wanna do is get Willie out of here. I'm his employer. Well, that won't be difficult. This is a private institution. Willie confined himself here voluntarily. He's free to leave... ...any time he feels that he's re-acquired his mental faculties. Let me talk to him. I'll tell him to get them back. - Where is he? - Right down the hall. I'll show you. Boss. Am I glad to see you. Welcome home. Here, sit down. Wait. Take it easy. That's what the guys told me and it was a foul ball. Not with me. I'm a hundred percent for you. Well, you better be. I got things to tell you... Excuse us, will you? I wanna talk to Willie alone. - Certainly. I'll be in the office. - Thanks. A nice gent. Boss, I can't get over that you're back. Now, button your lip and listen, will you? I got work for you to... Move over, Willie. I got work for you to do, see? Now, here's what I want you to do. Don't say nothing to them. They're bad medicine. Shucks, I ain't afraid of a few lunatics. Hello, kid. - Good morning. - What's your boyfriend doing? - Got something up his sleeve? - Just ignore him, Clarence. He'll go away. Double talk. I reckon you boys better go someplace else. That's nice, fellas. Now, come on. Come on. That's a hot one. - Where'd your boyfriend go, toots? Inside? - Don't pay them no attention. Play like they're not here. Now, come on, fellas. Be nice boys. Now, come on, fellas, come on. I gotta round up a new organization. Gonna pull a mob that'll run Jack Buck out of the country. You're talking. Who'll we get? I don't know. I've been away for five years. Times have changed. Who do you know tough and running around? - What month is this? - June. Why? Handsome Harry Edwards'll be out. I can grab him in Philly. Now, who else? A torpedo is what I'll need. Turkey Malone is the guy. He just got back from fighting in one of them foreign wars. - Is he any good? - Is he any good? - They was paying him piecework. - Okay. Here's what you do. Take a powder out the joint. Round up a mob... ...and meet me Saturday at the Crest Hotel. We'll work out of there. Don't forget. Don't do anything to Jack Buck... ...or his mob beforehand that'll tip him off. - Right. - What's that? - Sounds like a mutiny. Nothing to worry about, Mr. Sarto. I'm just bringing in a couple of nuts here... ...that was kind of bothering Florence and me. Look. Look, boss, who they are. - Where's Flo? - In the car. She fainted. I'm going out and tell her to move over. What time is it? - Twenty after 11. - Maybe something happened to Willie. I don't like this whole setup, boss. We're conning ourselves if we think we can knock over Buck. What are you talking about? Didn't I take the pushcart peddlers away from him? The fruit peddlers in Canarsey? Who had them before? Jack Buck. Who now? Me. We done a lot in 10 days, but still we gotta be careful. So far all we've grabbed off this guy Buck has been peanuts. - But this is different. - Now look, you mugs. I'm getting tired of this conversation. If any of you are nervous, wanna drop out, there's the door. You got us wrong, Johnny. We ain't yellow. We just think you're going a little too far too soon with Jack Buck. Shut up, everybody. Open the door, Harry. Come in, gentlemen. Look, Johnny. I don't know nothing. I never did noth... Oh! Shut up. I'll do the talking. You answer when you're told to. Put him in a chair. We hear Jack Buck's got a date... ...with the Acme Paving Company to sell them some protection. Who's he meeting, where's it gonna be? - We ain't got no date with the Acme. - You're a liar. We know all about it. You gonna get smart and talk? Do you need working on? Don't know nothing. Even if they got a date, I don't know about it. Your last chance. Gonna spill it or I start to work? You're crazy, Johnny. You can't get away with this. Oh! - I'll talk, boss. I'll talk. - Now you're getting smart. Who's he gonna see and where? They're seeing Tom Bailey on 8th Avenue this afternoon at 3:00. The fee is 2 Gs a month. Philadelphia Powell and Al Muller will be present. Now that's all I wanted to know. See how easy it was to talk, Mugsy? Give him a cigar, Dopey. No, sir, Mr. Bailey, you haven't got a thing to worry about. From now on, if any of the men get out of line all you do is reach for a telephone. We'll only bite you once a month for your dues. That's all there is to it. Naturally, I want to avoid any more trouble. I think you know what... Just got here in time, huh? - What do you care? What do you want? Hoist them. Wait a minute, gentlemen. What's this all about? Now, just a minute, Mr. Bailey. I'm Little John Sarto. What were these mugs doing? You're gonna be sorry. - Shut up. These gentlemen represent a protective organization. I was just on the point of taking a policy with them. Well, you ain't, see? You're taking it out with me. These mugs couldn't protect a nurse in a baby parade. - Throw them out. - You heard him. Come on. Sit down, Mr. Bailey. Now, you and me'll get together on some real protection. I reckon it ain't very important. The newspapers'd be making lot more of it. I know, but sometimes the littlest items make the biggest funerals. It just makes me sick way down inside to see you so worried. - Lf there was just something I could do. - Monsieur Sarto is on the telephone. Oh, okay, Fifi. Hello. I've been thinking about you. Where you at? I'm at the hotel. I won't be able to see you for dinner tonight. Oh, you gotta lay low, huh? No. I got a new deal on the fire. It means a lot to me. And I wanna close it quick. Now, stop worrying, will you? How can I help it? Every time the phone rings or somebody knocks at the door... ...I get the needles, thinking something's happened. Listen, baby. We can't go on like this. Why, yesterday afternoon I couldn't sleep a wink. I know how it is but can't you see I'm doing all this for us, see? When I'm back on top again, you and me'll be married. We'll have a life that'll be the talk of the town. Tell you what. Call me up later, let me know where you're at. Okay. Everything all right? Oh, sure, everything's all right. If it's money, Florence, I'd be more than happy to help out. I wouldn't dare offer Johnny money. He'd knock me for a loop. It's terrible, Clarence. It's terrible. You want me to tell you something? Know why he's going through all this? - I reckon he's broke. - No, that ain't it. It's on account of me. - You know what he just said? - What? He just said that when he was on top, we were gonna be married. Ain't that grand? Yeah. - It sure is. - And me, I ain't doing nothing to help him. Even now he's in a spot, I ain't doing nothing to take him off it. I reckon your worrying about him ain't gonna help matters none. What you need is a vacation. A couple of months on my ranch would do you good. Oh, if there was just something I could do. You'd make a mighty pretty picture coming through the willows in the moonlight. Everything so peaceful and quiet. Did you ever smell alfalfa? No. Who makes it? It's grass. Sure smells sweet after it's just been cut. Yeah. Me smelling alfalfa and him cooped up in a cheap hotel room... ...fighting to make a comeback for me. I know you'd like it on the ranch, Florence, with all the horses and the dogs. I got a cute little gentle pinto pony you could have. - All the rest of them buck but he... - Buck. You give me an idea. - Jack Buck. - What about Jack Buck? I'm going right to Jack Buck myself. It's a lot of baloney him and Johnny being enemies. They got too much on each other. Guess who's outside? - Yeah? Who? - Flo Addams. - Anybody with her? - She's all by herself. Says she's gotta see you right away. Oh, she does, huh? - All right, let her come in. - Okay. - Mike. Yes, sir? Johnny Sarto's girl is here. Watch the front just in case. - Hello, kid. - Hello, Jack. Come on in. Glad to see you. Sit down. Before I say a word... ...you gotta promise me something. - What is it? Don't say nothing to Johnny about this. He'd be sore if he knew I was here. I won't say a word. What's on your mind? You and Johnny shouldn't be fighting. This is all a lot of hooey. It ain't nice, is it? You and him used to be partners once. - You ought to be again. - Yeah, but Johnny don't like me no more. It makes me feel bad too. It's no good you two being enemies. You got too much on each other. - We have? - Sure. Coppers still wanna know who knocked off Big Tim O'Hara... ...in Molly Madigan's caf about five years ago. Little John knows all about that. That's right. That's right. I forgot that entirely. Thanks for reminding me. You and Johnny could sit down and talk over your differences easy, Jack. I wish we could. It makes me feel sick to have Johnny mad at me. Then why don't you do it? Why don't you get together and chew the rag? - I bet you end up shaking hands. - I'd like to. Johnny wouldn't make no date with me alone. It wouldn't hurt to try, would it? I could arrange it. - You could? - Sure. Where do you wanna meet him? Well, let's see... What about Fat Dutchy's at say, 10:00 tonight? That's a little far out, ain't it? Don't worry. I ain't thinking what you're thinking. I just wanna get away from the boys. All the boys. - You know what I mean? - Sure. Couldn't you make it some lawyer's office? Oh, that's no good. Right away we start off distrusting each other. What Johnny and me's gotta do is forget the rough stuff. Like you said. Him and me has gotta sit down alone together. Then in five minutes we're pals just like we used to be. Am I right? Oh, I'd do anything in the world to see it like that. Okay, then. You have Johnny at Fat Dutchy's tonight at 10:00. I'll be the first guy to stick out my hand. - You're on the level? You ain't kidding? - You got my word. - And no funny business? - Johnny's my old-time pal. I wouldn't hurt him for the world. Him and me just had a business misunderstanding. Oh, thanks, Jack. Oh, and by the way, don't let him know I'm gonna be there. It'd be better for us just to bump into each other. - You know what I mean? - I'll get him there. You gotta do the rest. Okay. Oh, Flo. Yeah? You're a swell dame. - Yeah? - Johnny's a pretty lucky guy. What you're doing for him makes me think this ain't a bad world after all. Well, you're not such a bad guy yourself, Jack. - So long. - So long, kid. Yes, boss? - Don't let them gorillas go back to Chicago. Don't make any dates for tonight, Clarence. - Are we going out? - Yeah. I'm taking you someplace with me for protection. I ain't so dumb as somebody thinks. Remember, Clarence. Park over there, don't come in unless I holler for you. I still don't like the idea of your going in there alone. Forget it. I've been in this joint before, ain't even been flirted with. Go on. Thanks. Hey, waiter. - Yes, lady? - Where's your telephone? I'll bring you one. - Give me the phone. - Here it is. - Gee, class, huh? - Yeah. - Fat Dutchy seen them do it up in the city. - Well, what do you know? Thanks. Long-distance, Crescent 99499. Hello? Hello, Johnny. This is Flo. Don't do that. Can't you see I'm talking to a friend of mine? Don't mind him, Johnny. He just thinks he's funny. Who's getting funny? Where you at? You're gonna be awful mad at me, baby. You're oiled. Have you been drinking? I'm as sober as you are but they won't let me drive the car. Will you come and get me, baby? I'm at Fat Dutchy's. Fat Dutchy's? That's 30 miles from here. If you think I'm coming to get you, you're crazy. I don't think you love me anymore. If you did, you'd come and get me... ...before I pass out all over the place. If you're trying to get me nervous, you're not. I'm busy in a conference. Get a cab, let me alone. Okay, my friend, if that's the way you feel about it... ...just forget I ever bothered you. I'll phone Clarence. He'll come and get me and I'll tell him what I just heard... ...about Jack Buck and the Independent Freight Handlers Association. Goodbye. Wait. Don't hang up. What's that you were saying about Jack Buck... ...and the Freight Handlers Association? - Never mind. You're not interested. You're in a big conference. You're awful busy. Stop it, will you? Don't be so playful. Hello, Johnny. Hang up will you, so's I can call Clarence? No, I don't want you to come. Just forget about me. I'll see you around sometime. Will you stop that talk? I'll come out and get you. Don't drink no more. Get them palookas away from you. Be right out. Okey-dokey. - Wait here. - Yes, sir. Buddy, are you Miss Addams' chauffeur? Miss Addams? Yeah. Why? She wanted me to give you this note. - May I check your hat, sir? - No, I'll hold it. I won't be here long. What's the big idea? Hello, honey. I'm glad you come. Sit down. What are you telling me you were stewed for? Oh, well, I was, honey, but it wore off. Have you been thinking about me lately? Are you nuts? What's going on here, anyway? - What do you mean what's going on? - What's the idea of coming here? Stop acting like you was making a play. We know each other. Well, I was blue this afternoon and I went for ride. Must've been awful blue to come this far. Listen, if I gave in to all my worries I'd be in Omaha. Well, get your things together. - We'll blow out of here. - Don't you want a drink first? You ain't never seen me take a drink in your life. I don't like the way you're sparring. You're hiding something. Oh, honey, I've never seen you so suspicious. - Well, come on. - All right. I'll powder my nose and then we'll go. Thanks, Flo. Hello, Johnny. Glad to see you, pal. Hello, Jack. What's the gag? You're all alone, Johnny. This is a good time for you and me to have a little talk. Well, take that rod out of my back. I'll listen. It's warm in here. How's about you and me stepping outside for a few minutes, huh? - I'm comfortable here. - Yeah, but I'm not. The music upsets me. Makes me nervous. My hand is shaking. You know what I mean? Come on. - Hi, Herman. - Hi, Jack. - Hello, Dave. How's the missus? - Fine, Jack. Lovely people. All right, pal, let's go. Get in, Johnny. Only one thing I wanna know. Sure, Johnny. Speak right up. Why did Flo double-cross me? Now, why don't you get smart. She wanted the other guy. You come back and was in the way. That makes sense, don't it? Yeah. That makes sense. Okay, come on. - So this is it, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, this is it. - Okay, Red. Get going. - Come on, start walking. See what's on the radio, will you, Mugsy? Now to go forth to sleep. Stretch legs out, toes in. Everybody got his little tootsies in? Oh, wait. Hey, listen, buddy. If I get back you get 5 grand. You got it on you, darling? - No, but I could dig it up in a week. - Sorry, sweetheart. We do a strictly cash business. Keep going. It's midnight, Brother Superior. Our meeting has lasted a long time. Perhaps tomorrow things will look better. That's what we've been telling ourselves for the past three months. With conditions in the flower market... ...I don't see how we're gonna continue our charities. We must think of some kind of plan. Come in. Brother Superior, please come to the infirmary at once. - What has happened? - Ten minutes ago... ...I heard a groan outside the wall of my window. It was a man terribly hurt. I carried him in. I think he's dying. Come. I made it. I'm in heaven. Don't excite yourself, my son. You've been badly hurt. If I'm not in heaven, where am I? You're alive and in a safe place. Hey, do you know who I am? No. You never seen my picture in the papers? We don't see the newspapers here. And we don't ask who a man is if he needs help. How long am I in for? Until you're well and strong again. Well, I ain't got no money. Neither have we. That makes you one of us, doesn't it? This is the Monastery of the Little Brothers of the Flowers. I am Brother Superior. This is Brother Wren, your nurse. If you wish us to notify your friends... I got no friends. Well, you have now. Now, you must try to rest. I'll call in later. If you want anything, ask Brother Wren. Brother Wren, huh? You was a fighter once, wasn't you? We don't ask questions like that. What we were, good or bad, rich or poor, big or small... ...doesn't matter here. That's double jake by me. - I think I'm gonna like this place. - I hope so. Say, tell me something. What's the graft here? - Graft? - Yeah. It's been 15 years or more since I've heard such talk. We raise flowers and sell them in the city. Oh, say, there's good gelt in that. I bet your boys are cutting up a nice profit, huh? Well, what we clear, and lately it's been very little... ...we give to the poor. Well, that's a nutsy way to run an organization. - Oh, Brother? - Yes? Was the boss conning me about newspapers? You guys never read them? Brother Superior is right. We never read them. - How about visitors? - We very rarely have any. Boy, oh, boy. What a spot. Say, tell me, how does a guy join up with this outfit? Well, it's fairly easy. - Lf a man wants to become a novice... - A which? A novice. They don't take holy vows. They have few religious duties... ...chiefly saying their payers. They are not permitted to go outside the walls, and they must obey their superiors. Yeah. Well, what's the other catches? As a novice, a man must be on probation. - That means... - Yeah, I know all about probation. - When can I sign? - You'll have to talk to Brother Superior. Oh, and by the way... ...would you care to give us your name? Oh, while I'm here I think I'm gonna let you guys call me Lucky. Well, I'm afraid that wouldn't be acceptable in the Floracian Order. Oh, it wouldn't, huh? I got it. This spot's got something to do with flowers. Well, I always was a great guy for orchids. That'll be my new tag, Brother Orchid. That's fine. We'll tell Brother Superior tomorrow. Now, meanwhile, you must try to sleep. Say, look, Brother, could you slip me that paper and a pencil? Of course. There you are. And while you're writing, I'll go for a stamp and an envelope. Oh, thanks. Heh. Huh. "Dear Willie... Uh... Beat it... ...for Kansas City... ...and stay there... ...for when I wanna get you. I'm okay... ...and in a swell hideout... ...run by the biggest chumps in the world. " - There. - Thanks. I'm sure you'll be comfortable here. If you want anything, just call me. I'll be nearby, hoeing potatoes. Hoeing potatoes? Say, don't you never get tired? You been sitting up with me three or four nights in a row now. That was because you needed me. But like all the brothers, I still have my regular work to do. You're a funny ghee. Well, so is the rest of this mob around. You know, I don't get you birds at all. Our lives hold no mystery. We've merely learned that in doing things for others... ...it is we ourselves who reap the richest reward. Reward, huh? I figured there was a take somewhere. Say, slip me the info. How does the dough actually get in here? No, there's no material gain. The reward I mentioned is the happiness that comes to the heart... ...when a man knows he has been of service to another human. Yeah? I don't know whether you got something there or not. You make it sound right. But the rules in the world I been living in ain't like that. Well, perhaps you learned the new rules and the old ones are so much better. But you've talked enough. You mustn't waste your strength. If you need me, just call. Hmm. Are you feeling better now? Yeah. Oh, hello. Hello, Brother Superior. Grab a chair somewhere. I wanna talk to you. In a few moments. Brother Williams cut his foot with a rake. - I must see him right away. - Sure. But I'll hurry back. We should have a little chat. You're well enough to leave for the outside world. Hey, wait a minute. Didn't Brother Wren tell you I was signing up with your league? He did mention that you were thinking about becoming a novice. Well, sure. I give him all the dope. I thought I'd be all set by now. You are. I wanted to make certain that your decision came from your heart. From the heart? Brother Superior, I've been giving this joint the double O. I've met a lot of the inmates personally. You're all okay guys. So just you write your own ticket and I'll sign. Okay, Brother Orchid. Splendid, Brother Orchid. Yes. I always was one who could wear a uniform. - Are your sandals comfortable? - Hmm? Oh, pretty nifty. Say, this is the first time I've seen shoes that are air-conditioned. Heh-heh-heh. - Your hat, Brother Orchid. - Oh, thanks. Genuine Kansas panama, huh? Well, it ain't much but I'll fix it up. I'll put a feather in it. Well, thanks, pal. Be seeing you. Well, well, now. I have a surprise for the brothers. What is it? The roses brought $2 more than we anticipated. As a reward, I've decided to take the money and give you a treat. A treat? - What's it gonna be? On Thursday for lunch, we shall have watermelon. Watermelon. Marvelous. Watermelon? Why, we haven't had watermelon for over two years. Lt'll be quite a delicacy for us. - What are you doing? - Shaving your head. No, you don't. Do you have to? No. It's quite optional. Well, nothing doing. See, I got my looks to think about. - Oh, come in, Joseph. - You got a vibrator in the joint? - A what? - Skip it. I know you ain't. Brother MacEwen will cut your hair in a moment. Thank you, Brother Superior. By the way, you ought not to go barefooted. Your mother tells me you're recovering from a cold. I haven't any shoes, Brother Superior. I was gonna get them this week, but Father was laid off. Have you no shoes at all, Joseph? Here, Joseph. Here are $2. You run in to town and get a pair of shoes. MacEwen will cut your hair when you get back. - Gee, thanks. - Come, my boy. - Say, what about the watermelon? - Watermelon? Heh. - I never cared for it. - Me either. It always distresses me. Hmm? I get it. Nice mugs. How am I doing, pal? It's a miracle, Brother Orchid. No one else has ever been able to get as much milk from Hildegard as you. Yeah, just a certain touch I got, that's all. It must be more than that, Brother Orchid. - It must be. - Why? Because you have been with us such a short time. Yet whatever you attempt, you do so much better than we who've been here for years. Well, you boys don't want to get discouraged. I always was a little bit better than the other guy. I ain't conceited about it because I found it out when I was young. That still doesn't explain this milking of yours. I milked Hildegard for years. And do as I might, she never yielded more than 12 quarts a day. Yet from the first time you milked her, she gave 16. Oh, well, it just sums up to one thing, pal. I put a little more into my work and get a little more out. - We bear wonderful news, Brother Orchid. - Congratulations. - What about? - Thanks to you... ...for the month just ended, Hildegard has yielded a total of 492 quarts. It's beyond belief. Brother Superior asked us to tell you your reward. Beginning tomorrow, you're to be given your own zinnia bed to cultivate all by yourself. Zinnia bed, huh? That good? Zinnias earn us most of our money in the flower market this time of the year. You will have a grave responsibility. And I might add that is the highest award a brotherhood can bestow upon a novice. No kidding, huh? Well, say, I sure appreciate that. Heh. With your permission, we'll go at once and spread the good tidings to all the brothers. Yeah. Go ahead, pals. I wanna be alone, you know. Getting this honor makes me feel a little dizzy. You know, these guys are so swell to me, Hildegard, I just ain't got the heart. Beginning right now, I'm only gonna spike it two quarts instead of three. It's not so much that they're the best zinnias we've ever grown... ...but it's the thought that Brother Orchid has raised them all by himself. It is remarkable. Think of him when he arrived, to realize that after three months... ...he's developed into one of our best workers. Yes, he is a changed man. And his work reflects the change too. Look. Look. Aren't they beautiful? Congratulations. These are lovely. - Very lovely. - Yeah, thanks, Brother Superior. I was telling Brother Superior how hard you worked. Yeah, I am kind of tuckered out. But I don't mind it. They're very beautiful but you mustn't work too hard. I can't help it. You know, them zinnias are just like my babies. Would you believe it? Sometimes in the night... ...I catch myself wanting to get up and give them a drink. We're very proud of you. You're setting us all a splendid example. Well, thank you, warden. I mean, Brother Superior. I guess I am giving you something to shoot at. This being Wednesday, tonight after supper, I will deliver one of my informal talks. You shall be the subject. Yeah? Well, say, that's swell. Heh-heh. Glad you tipped me off. Ain't taken a bow in so long. I'm afraid my back will creak. - Continue with your work, Brother Orchid. - Yeah. Thanks. Hop to it. You got more rows to hoe, then knock off for the day. Brother Orchid, my father says I should ask you... ...when you're gonna pay me the 50 cents for last month. Oh. Tell your old man not to worry. Maybe tomorrow I'll slip you an IOU. That'll do you as much good as my check. Now hop to it, will you? Ahh. As is customary, tonight I had planned one of my informal talks. My subject was to have been a brother who has been with us just a few months. Unfortunately, just before supper, an incident took place... ...which makes it impossible for me to deliver the talk I had previously planned. What I am about to say pains me very deeply. We have worked together in harmony for a long, long time. But now... ...for the first time in more than 20 years... ...I find I must publicly reprimand a member of this order. - Brother Orchid... - Huh? ...just before this meal, Joseph's father came to see me. He tells me that his son has been working in your zinnia patch... ...and that you now refuse to pay him. - Is that true? - Why, the little muzzler. Brother, you are not answering the question. Has Joseph been doing your work? Well, no, not exactly. I did have the kid toss a pail or two of fertilizer but I couldn't help it. I'm allergic to it. There are times, Brother Orchid, when we appreciate your earthy witticisms. This is not such a time. I'm sorry. The fact remains that you promised Joseph money... ...and you had no money with which to pay him. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. We have two rules here, my friend: One, we do not hire others to do our work. Two, we do not make promises we cannot fulfill. You have hurt and shamed every man in this room. Because, being brothers, we must all share your disgrace. That is all. Good night. Here, wait a minute now. I got something to say too. You're all making me feel like I was a heel and I don't like it. You know, not so long ago, I was out in the world looking for class and society. If anybody told me I'd get myself upset over zinnia... ...gee, I would have thought they was nuts. Believe it or not, I worked hard over them flowers. And I did all the work myself. I dug up that patch. I raked it, planted the seeds, watered them... ...pulled out the weeds. And when the flowers started to grow... ...gee, I got a kick like I never had before. But you can't change a guy overnight. I'm such a mug that was taught to look for angles. Take things easy and you live a little longer. So a couple of weeks ago, I asked this kid to work for me. And I thought I was being awful smart. I guess... I guess I wasn't so smart. You may all retire. When the heart speaks, Brother Orchid... ...other hearts must respond. We're going to forget everything that happened. Are we? Tomorrow morning, this will be a closed incident. By the way, how much did you say you owe the boy? Fifty cents. The world moves on. Twenty years ago, for exactly the same work, I paid only a quarter. What's wrong, Brother Orchid? Are you ill? No, I'm all right. I'm all right. "Florence Addams, popular nightclub owner... ...announced that she would marry Clarence P. Fletcher... ...wealthy Midwestern rancher, next week. Miss Addams was reported to be fiance of Little John Sarto, gang leader... ...who is believed slain but whose body has never been discovered. " Oh, so I'm a dead pigeon, huh? "'Well, never in my life,' Miss Addams told reporters... '... have I been so thrilled and happy. "' Oh, Brother Superior, will you do me a favor? Why, certainly, what is it? Look, I've always wanted to know how the selling part is run. How's about taking me to the market with you? Let me see. Yes, you've been with us long enough. I think you've earned a trip to the city. Get in. Thanks. You've barely spoken all the way in, Brother Orchid. Is the trip thrilling you as much as that? No, I ain't thrilled. - Look, I'm getting out here. - Wait, where...? I can't tell you. I haven't got time. I'll meet you here... ...then I'll tip you off to everything. - But, Brother Orchid, wait. - Oui, monsieur? - Oui, yourself. Let me in. Don't stand there ogling. Where's your boss? Madame is at the beauty salon. Whom shall I say called? Don't say anybody called. I'm waiting. - Thank you very much. - Go on now, beat it. Hey, what's the matter with you? It's me, Little John. Johnny... ...is it really you? You ain't dead. Well, if I am, I'm the livest corpse you ever seen. Come on, get up. I got things to say. I ain't gonna waste time. Johnny, it feels like a guy's jumping rope in my stomach. Sure. That's the way all squealers feel when they meet the guy they put the finger on. Look, I don't know what's happened. One thing I gotta set you straight on right away. I didn't double-cross you at Fat Dutchy's. I wanted Jack Buck to make up with you. He promised me he would if I got you there. I was dumb to believe him. Yeah? What do you think now, I'm dumb to believe you? Oh, Johnny, you gotta believe me. It's the truth and I can prove it. Here, read this. "If the coppers ask any questions, keep your mouth shut about Sarto. They won't believe you got him... ...to make up with me anymore than Johnny would himself. Get smart and stay that way. " Jack Buck's handwriting all right. - You got it? - Last month... ...when the cops looked for him. - For? The Tim O'Hara killing, policy knockoffs and an income tax rep. If the cops nail him, he'll got a hundred years. Maybe life. Well, well, well. So Jack Buck's on the lam, huh? - Where's he at? - I don't know. - Nobody knows his hideout. - I might know something about that. Oh, Johnny... ...please don't be mad at me. I know I did a dizzy thing but I was only trying to help you. I'm awful glad you're back. Gee, you don't know how I've missed you. If you ain't a screwball, there never was one. Why? You've missed me so much that tomorrow... ...you're marrying another guy. - Oh! Wait a minute, Johnny. When everybody said you was rubbed out, I went to pieces. Honest, right to pieces. Clarence was swell to me, really swell. And later, when he asked me to marry him, I said okay. But I never said I loved him. I never said that to nobody but you. Well, look, will you call the whole thing off with Clarence? I don't know how he'll feel about it. He's got some friends here from Montana for the wedding... ...but I got a hunch he'll understand. - Okay, then listen. Slip Clarence the news and I'll be back. We'll get married, shove off for Kansas, where I got Willie the Knife planted. I'll get back into harness and take over. You with me? - Oh, am I? - All right, now. Finish packing, will you? - I'll be right back. - Johnny, wait a minute. - What is it now? - That outfit you got on. What did you do, join a convent? - Certainly not. - Well, then why are you wearing a wrapper? Ahh... Oh. - I hope I didn't keep you waiting long. - No, that's all right. Sorry I skipped away like that... ...but something happened I have to take care of right away. No apologies are necessary, Brother Orchid. Yeah, look... ...I gotta get something off my chest and I only hope you won't be sore. First, I gotta tell you that the last six months of my life... ...were the happiest I've ever known. - I'm very glad. I hope you'll continue to be happy with us. Well, that's... That's what I'm trying to tell you. I won't be able to stay with you... What's this? Ain't you sold the flowers yet? - What happened? - That's why I'm so despondent. Our market is gone. They won't handle our flowers anymore. What? Who won't? - The wholesalers. - Huh? As I understand it, we don't belong to the Protective Association. Protective...? Did I hear you say Protective Association? Yes. I learned in the city that not a flower can be sold unless it's grown in their nurseries. I don't know what we're going to do. I really don't. Well, what Protective Association is this? I don't know. It's all so confusing to me. They did mention the name of some man wanted by the police. Buck? Jack Buck? Yes. Yes, that's it. How did you know? Well, it come to me in a dream. Look, Brother Superior. Will you move over to the curb for a minute? - Please. - Well. I'm gonna blab. Then I'm gonna blow. Now, don't say nothing, just let me talk. First, stop worrying about them flowers. You bring them to the market tomorrow. You'll find that nobody ain't gonna bother you no more. - I accept your word, my son. But I... - Now, please, just let me finish. L... I can't explain just why. It wouldn't do any good if I did. I gotta quit the monastery. - My son... - Now, wait. Now, like I said before... ...I ain't never been so happy. I never met people like you. People who think of the other guy. Forget about themselves. And I've been living in new world that's been awful swell. But you know sometimes with a mug like me, your new world, my old world... ...just don't mix up proper. And I wish I could stay on forever but I can't. So all I can say is so long and thanks. Look, I'll send you back this robe as soon as I get some new clothes. - Well, thanks for everything. - But, my brother. Brother. Close your sleepy eyes My little Buckaroo While the light of Western skies Is shining down on you Don't you know it's time for bed - Where's your boss? - In the library with Monsieur Fletcher. So go to sleep My little Buckaroo - Johnny. - I'd be here sooner... ...only I had trouble promoting this suit from a friend. - Oh, am I butting in? - That's all right, Mr. Sarto. We were just talking about you. What we got to say I reckon we can say to your face. - You told him? - Look, Johnny... ...why don't you let me and him alone a few minutes. Florence has told me everything, Mr. Sarto. I've come to realize you must have a powerful wrong impression of me. Yeah? How's that? I always believed you thought I was a pretty good fella. Now I realize you also thought I was awful dumb. Now, wait a minute, Clarence. Johnny didn't never say no such thing. Certainly, I didn't. I never said anything about you. - Never even thought anything about you. - You proved that... ...when you walk in here and expect me to call off my marriage. Oh, so that's it, huh? So you think I'm cutting you out? Let me tell you. Flo's been my girl for years. We're always gonna get married, it wasn't in the cards. You was the one who come along and butted in. Am I right? Is that right, Florence? Is that the way you feel? I've always loved Johnny, Clarence. I've got to call it the way I see it. I'm sorry I kicked up my heels the way I did, Mr. Sarto. I was just proud enough to believe I could make Florence happy. Now I'm just humble enough to realize you're the man to do it... ...and to wish you both all the good luck in the world. Well, shake. You're okay. Say, you got class too. Can you imagine what I could've done with him in the organization, huh? Hey, wait a minute. - What, Johnny? - Gee, I got an idea. Look... ...those guys outside, are they your pals? My closest. They've come in town to see my wedding. - I don't know what they're gonna do. - Look... ...if they want excitement, I'll dish it. I wanna knockdown to them. You wait here a minute. Boys, I want you to shake hands with Mr. Sarto. - This is Tex Pearson. Curley Matthews. - Howdy. - This here is Buffalo Burns. - How do you do? - Glad to know you. - Mr. Sarto's a good friend of mine. - Him and Florence... - Let me do the talking. - I wanna proposition these mugs. Proposition? It's like this, see? I just come from a monastery. I'm only in there on a rain check and I want to take a powder. But I can't. They're in trouble. I don't wanna leave them that way. - What particular brand of trouble, Mr. Sarto? - It's like this, see? These guys at the monastery sell flowers. The dough they make, they give away to the poor. That's mighty handsome. - Mighty. - Well, I just found out... ...that some mugs are gonna make it tough for them. They ain't gonna let them sell their flowers unless they shell out. - Maybe not even then. - Why don't the fellas in the monastery... ...do something? - Well, they can't, see. They're quiet, peaceful little guys that wouldn't hurt a bug. They can't fight. And they ain't got the dough to pull strings. Too bad we ain't got these hombres to home. We'd sure know what to do with them. Yeah. We wouldn't even bother the sheriff. We'd ride them out of town. We don't waste much time with bad men, Mr. Sarto. Takes almost half a day to bring a man into court. That's a powerful waste of time. Powerful. Well, cheer up then. I'll give you guys a chance to settle this in your own way. You mean we can run those tough boys out of town? You hit it right on the button, pal. I know where they're hiding out and I'm going there. Are you guys with me? - I got a little something to attend to. - I know. I heard you talking inside. You're headed for trouble. And I'm scared. What kind of malarkey is this? It ain't no malarkey. It's that I don't want nothing to spoil what's coming true after all these years. That's why I'm scared, Johnny. Because I'm awful stuck on you. When you speak like that you're knocking at Johnny Sarto's heart with a sledgehammer. Don't you worry. I'll be back before you know it. - How does that make you feel? - I'll tell you on the train. Here's the elevator, Mr. Sarto. Johnny, wait a minute. I want you to carry this with you. - What is it? - It's a rabbit's foot, a lucky charm. My uncle wore it for 32 years. It's good luck, huh? - Where'd you get it? - My mother. With her hands she took it off my uncle after they hung him. - Come on, Mr. Sarto! Time's a-wasting. All right. - Who is it? - Mr. Clarence Fletcher. Clarence Fletcher? Anybody know him? Not me. We're closed. Come back in the morning. I've got an important message. I reckon you'd like to have it tonight. - What do you say? - Let him in. What have we got to be afraid of? - Howdy. - Well, well, well. Look who's here. Remember him? Pattonsville Sanitarium. Why, certainly. Certainly, I remember him. - You fellows look kind of familiar, at that. - Sure we do. Come right in, Mr. Fletcher. Boy, are we glad to see you. Yeah. Remember what you did to us last time? Yipeee! Keep punching them, cowboy. - Okay, Buck, come on out. Get them up. You knew just where I was hiding. You made a mistake. Not as big as you're liable to make. You were lucky last time but you ain't gonna be now. Right in there, boss. - All right. Break it up, pal. - Hey, come on. - Come on. - Hold it, now. Break it up! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Mr. Sarto, he went in there. - You said someone came in here? - Mr. Sarto did. He was after Jack Buck. - Are you sure? - Why, I saw him. - He came right through... - Hey, wait, look. If you want Jack Buck, go in and get him. Are you all right, Mr. Sarto? Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. You and me gotta go and talk to Flo. L... I don't think I better go up there, Mr. Sarto. After all, there isn't very much that I can say to Florence anymore. Now, wait a minute, Clarence. You know, coming up here in the cab I been thinking a lot. You're the guy going up to see Flo. - I'm breezing along. - Yeah? Sure. Look, pal. You turned out to be a real guy in my book, so I'm gonna let down my hair. I ain't been on the level with Flo. Never. What are you saying, Mr. Sarto? Oh, she's a good dame, and all that. All the love I got for her, you could stick in your eye. - I don't get you at all. - Oh, I'm on the level. All this talk about me wanting to marry her is a lot of canal water. Man alive. You know, to such a guy like me... ...love is like a scratch on the back. Sometimes feels good. But a guy can't go along all his life with an itch. Florence is gonna take this awful hard. No, she ain't. Because you're gonna be the guy to tell her. You know, between us... ...I was gonna take her to Kansas, get a grand out of her, then ditch her. That'd be a pretty cheap thing to do, wouldn't it? Yeah, sure. That's why I changed my mind. I'm gonna hop a freight and go away by myself. I got a friend there. I'll do all right. If it's a question of money, maybe I can help out. Yeah, you sure could, pal. - Lf you could let me have a couple of Cs. - Sure. You bet How much is a couple of Cs? Two hu... Three hundred dollars. - Here you are. - Thanks, pal. - Now go on up and do your stuff. - Oh. It might be easier on her if you sent some little message. Something nice about her I could say you said. What are you trying to do, coax me to be a hypocrite? Now, go on up there quick before I change my mind. Still clip her for a couple of grand. Twelfth floor. Look, mum. Got any kids? No. I ain't got nothing. Well, you got something now. Brothers... ...there is good cause to be thankful this morning. I have just received the good news that there is no longer a Protective Association... ...and that we may again sell our flowers in the city. How this was accomplished, I cannot tell you. All I know is that Brother Orchid gave me his word it would be done... ...and it was done. As you know, Brother Orchid is no longer among us. He has chosen the outside world. And none of us is wise enough to say that we are right and he is wrong. All we can do in our humble way... ...is to wish him the utmost of health... ...and the happiness and throughout our... Brother Orchid. Have you changed your mind? Yeah. Brother Superior... ...all my life I'm such a guy that was looking for class. I went halfway around the world trying to find it... ...I thought that class came in dough and nice clothes and society. Well, I was wrong. I sure traveled a long way to find out one thing: This... ...this is the real class.
