The sooner I can verify his address, the sooner I can leave him alone. - You've been here for... - A year and a half. Have you used any aliases in the past six months? - No. - "No." What do you do? I mean, for fun. Just... Go to church. I attend a support group. Uh-huh. What kind of support group? Come on, man, you know. What do you think about, Vincent? I mean sexual thoughts. - I don't know. - Come on. Everyone has sexual thoughts. You ain't supposed to ask me that. That's not on the questionnaire. You're right. - How've your moods been? - Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. You taking your medication? - Yeah. - Good. It's important to do that. Any feelings that might lead you to do something you don't want to do? No. How would you cope with a feeling that might lead you to stray? I'll settle down with a nice girl. Does that sound realistic to you, Vincent? I don't know. What do you think about when you masturbate? You think about settling down with a nice girl? Or you think about holding her down? Morning. She starts today. You'll be sharing a desk and a car. Oh, good good good good. Good. - You want to meet her? - You know I got another month, right? Send in Allison, please. You can retire right this minute if you want to. - You've earned it. - No. No, Bobby, no. No, I have not earned this. Mmm. - Hi. - Allison Lowry, this is Errol Babbage. Mr. Babbage, it's a pleasure to meet you. Yeah, no need to be so wonderful. You got the job... - apparently. - Errol, would you excuse us for a moment, please? Surely, yeah. Okay. Good, very good. Usually, I'd ask a seasoned guy like Errol to help you stay out of trouble. In this situation, things are the other way around. Any questions, just ask. Thank you. You're not gonna learn anything from them... except how to keep your job. That's yours. This is your desk. Move that over if you want. - You coming? - Oh, yeah. We have a young man who just moved here from out of state. - What did he do? - Rape. Second degree, plea bargain. I don't care what he did. I care what he's gonna do. You know, these people are registered as a... as a courtesy to the public, to the victims, to the people who testified against them. Also because... because of what they're capable of... - Mm-hm. ...because of their potential. Registering them is one thing, but telling the future, that's... that's something else. We're fortune tellers. Predict wrong, people die. I was misunderstood. The male is more sexually aggressive by nature. It's a way of passing on their genetic material. "Misunderstood." His mother couldn't buy her off is what happened. Like she did with all the others. - What's your name, hon? - Beatrice Bell. - What was it? Beatrice Bell? Nice. - Beatrice Bell. So tell me, Beatrice Bell, how often does Edmund here pass on his genetic material? - I don't know. - Mm-hmm. Sometimes too often? Sometimes when things don't... quite function... right, you get the blame? I don't think this is appropriate. Then maybe you should wait outside. You know, you can call me when you've had enough of this guy. I'll help you get rid of him. Okay? Hey. What's that? Did you do this? You guys finished with the survey? - Did you do this? - And by the way, I brush... Hey, did you do this? You're a hitter, aren't you? Likes the sound of knuckles on a woman's body. Maybe she enjoys it. Maybe I do too. Okay, well, hey. All right, Edmund, okay. I'm just coming... I'm here to welcome you to the state. So, welcome. What are you circling? I keep track of offenses that might have been committed by one of my people. If a pattern develops, or something occurs to me that could help the police, I pass it on. Those questions weren't on the form. Mr. Babbage? They were invasive. Compulsive rapists, opportunistic rapists, armpit rapists, date rapists, fetishists, exhibitionists, frotteurs, molesters of animals, molesters of children... You better tell me now if you're too squeamish for this job. Call your mother, have her come pick you up. So what are you gonna do now? I mean, when you retire? I'm not retiring. I'm being let go. You could use a new look. Get some of that hair out of your face. I'll get the check. Don't worry, the department's paying for this. "Next registrant: Unlawful imprisonment, attempted sexual battery, three counts..." - Sit up, please. - Did two years. Could have been much worse, except for the plea bargain. Partner executed in August. For attempted battery? - No, murder. - This way, please. Yep, they slowly mutilated these women till they died... took over a week. And then they cut off their feet, their legs, their hands their arms, their tongues, their ears, - and their hair. - Jesus. It was all over the news. The one executed is Paul Gerard. Partner who rolled on him was his wife. We're talking about Paul Gerard's wife? Well, she's using her maiden name now. Aren't you, Viola? Ow! Sorry. You okay? Ah, Viola is my favorite registrant, aren't you, Viola? You should let me do something about that gray. You're never touching me. You can take care of the registration. I got a couple things to do. He enjoyed that. So, um, how long have you worked here? A week longer than that last time I was asked that question. What's wrong? I was as much a victim as those women. I'm not here to go over that. Paul would try out behavior on me, things he... later did to those three. He... he crept up behind me and grabbed me around my neck. I was told to widen my eyes... just so... in surprise. Then... he'd... drag me off to the bedroom where he'd smother me with a plastic bag. The only reason I'm alive... is because my death would have led to him. He didn't kill me. He killed who I was. Usually, Mr. Babbage comes to my home... three, four times a month. - What does he want? - Same questions... over and over. I'll make sure that he... he leaves you alone. And I'll be doing things differently. Did she say I saw her last week? Yes. Did she say she was innocent? Did she say she got off on what her husband did to those ladies? I can't tell if you're just green or indifferent. Is indifference the same as wishing you'd come up for air once in a while? I've got 18 days to teach you everything I can. I want you to see something, feel something. This is Viola's childhood farm. Now she says she was the victim? This is where the real victims suffered. Three girls known murdered. Three other girls disappeared about the same time she and Paul were caught. Tried to get her to confess, take me to where they buried them. I want to give their folks some peace. I've always suspected their bones scattered all over these fields. This isn't a registrant. Yeah, the daughter disappeared from a college campus six years ago. I always suspected Paul and Viola. Don't tell them I got fired. Errol's visits are difficult for me, but Ann seems to find some comfort in them. I'm grateful to him for that. That's her. That's Abigail. - She's pretty. - Mm-hmm. We don't know what happened. Errol's the only one who promised we would one day. That we'd know. The only one. Why are we staying here? We're just a couple hours from home. We're not going home. I have a little light reading for you. Oh, and if I didn't already tell you, always remember to carry a fresh shirt. Very important. Oh! Welcome. I'll have the nacho rapists, the buffalo wing rapists... the molesters of fried mozzarella with some... rib fetishists. I circled them all for you. - Hey, here's to Errol! - To Errol! Where is Errol, by the way? Where'd you go last night? Did you look in that book I gave you? Yes. Good, because I want you to always remember people like Paul and Viola Gerard don't just tell lies, they are lies. In public, they're decent, socially-responsible folk who look you in the eye, but never long enough to make you uncomfortable. They shake your hand, pat you on the back, but never overdo it. They're Christian if you are, they swear if you do, and they do this because people like you wrongly believe that public presentation tells us all about private lives. It tells us nothing. It hides everything. And what about you, Mr. Babbage? Tell me about your double life. What do you think about? I think about a girl who didn't come home, what I might have missed, and if I miss something again, who's next? That's a good boy. Bye, Harriet. See you tomorrow. See ya. This next registrant's a fellow by the name of Glenn Custis. He's turned his perversions into a business. He's a pornographer... movies, magazines. He also runs a little dominion. - What's a dominion? - You'll see. Why don't you look down that way? I'll go this way. Hey. I'm okay. Do you know where Glenn... I'm looking for Glenn Custis. Yeah! Mmm... Rasputin here says Custis is out. Glenn, this guy's looking for you. Glenn? I'm not Glenn. Nice hands. Nice fingers. - You're white. - Let go. Let go, let go. Hey hey hey hey hey, look at me. Look at me, look at me, look at me. You know who this is? This is one of Custis's girls. That's right, one of Glenn's girl... Look at me. Just look at me. Look in my eyes. Tell Custis I'm looking for him. Fuck. So you're not seeing anyone, I mean anyone who stayed. What did I tell you about the personal stuff? Okay. Whatever. It's just that l... I didn't see a spare toothbrush or a man's razor, so... But I did see a large pea coat hanging there. Shiny elbows and missing buttons, so... A smoker. It's not exactly your style, I don't think. But I guess it suited your needs for the time. Do you ever just have a normal conversation? This is normal conversation. No, I mean, "Hey... hey, how are you? Nice weather, huh? Hey, thanks for the drink." You don't talk, you pump. The fire has consumed over 1700 acres and 14 houses. In other news, police are investigating the disappearance of Harriet Wells. The 17-year-old is believed to have been abducted in the Paradise Hills area sometime yesterday. Harriet's parents made a plea in help tracing their daughter's whereabouts. We just want our daughter to come home. We want her to come back. She's our everything, our whole life. If anyone knows where she is, please just help me bring my baby home. Police have no suspects at this time. If you have any information... It's one of my flock. I know it. I missed something. - Errol, slow down. - Are you watching this? - Yeah, I just turned it on. - I'm not gonna go out like this. I'm not gonna have a mista... God damn it. - Are you okay? - No. No. No, I'm not okay. I'm not okay. Errol, you can't take this personally. You take this stuff personally! I've been on this job 18 years. You haven't even fucking started. You haven't even started. ...may have been the last to see her. While friends and family continue their own search efforts... # Harriet's parents made a plea today for help in tracing their daughter's whereabouts, but, investigators say, false tips continue to complicate the investigation. Sorry about the phone call. Department of Public Safety. All right, come with me. Can you wait here, please? - Officer in charge? - Yes. Can I talk to you a second? Something I want to show you... Babbage, we're on it. There are over 40 registered sexual offenders... - I know. ...within two miles of here. I know. We're handling it. ...responding to the possible 211. 2110 Emerson. Just hope and pray. You're right, you're right. You can take off, okay? Sure, okay. I don't know what else to do. What'd they say? They're gonna give me a medal. - Really? - Yeah, it's in the mail. - Have a nice day. - Thank you. Did you see who was... was sitting there? The newspaper... left it there? I don't think there was anybody sitting there. All right. - Did you put this here? - No. Someone left this here. They left it for me. How do you know somebody left it for you? Look at it... it's circled. It's folded just like me. Everything's the same. Look. Don't don't don't don't... don't touch. This is the one I bought. See that? Each of those are offenders. Red ones committed violent sexual acts against teenage girls or young women. We'll start with the registrants that are closest to the missing girl. It could take weeks to track down all these people. Someone I know has her. Someone who knows me. Someone on my registry. Did she meet a boy here? A friend? Was someone waiting for her here? Did someone see? Between 4:00, 4:30, you're the only engine on that track? Yeah. Car was white... light color, anyways. Newish. Shit, maybe even Jap. She was talking to somebody in the car, but hell, looked like she was just trying to catch a ride. Did you see him? Did you see the driver? - The guy she was talking to? - Nah, we didn't see anyone. There was a glare on the windshield. But you got it wrong. She wasn't talking to the driver. She was talking to someone in the passenger seat. Harriet talks to someone on the passenger side. That means we're looking for a team. Could be an old team, could be a brand-new team. Teams are glued together by common sexual appetites and fetishes. So you hit the files. I'll hit the phones. I'll see who's quit a job, changed their patterns. I'll listen to their voices. Hello? You're looking for abductors, rape or assault charges. Any perps with victims or MOs that match, you red-flag it, give it to me. Can I talk to your boss to confirm that? If you think that's really necessary. Put your boss on, Randy. Allison? You know, I got a phone call today from a very agitated sheriff's investigator. It seems a girl has disappeared. And you were out at her house? Errol thinks one of the registrants may be involved. And how did Errol come up with that one? Someone circled an article in the newspaper and left it for him to find. Errol was a no-show at his retirement party the other night. I'm not sure I understand. These guys here are all familiar with Errol's routines and his habits. Like how he dissects the newspapers, for instance. There was talk at the party of getting back at him. You think someone here circled the article? Yeah. Could be. I mean, he doesn't have a lot of friends around here. Well, maybe not. Are you gonna tell him? You're gonna tell him. Oh, and this abduction thing... has nothing to do with what you're being paid for. We're not police officers... we're public servants. All right? So we have 40 offenders within a two-mile radius, 89 within a five-mile radius. We're gonna hit every single one of 'em. Shouldn't we narrow down the list first? No, I want to start now. I'm gonna call it a day. Yeah, you do that. Just call it a day. Two months... that's how long you're gonna last. But why should this job be any different than the others? I'm not one of your registrants, Errol. Just lay off the personal stuff. Your mother says you spook easily. - You talked to my mother? - Among others. Said you change jobs at about the same rate you change men. Does privacy mean anything to you, Errol? You are a nosy person, my friend. He didn't just leave that newspaper for me. He left it for you too. When they find Harriet's body in a month, you'll be the one sitting at this desk, not me. Police are investigating the disappearance... Ahem. Police have no suspects... - Hello? - Matt? Hi, it's Allison Lowry... from the department. Ah, the new girl in town. Uh, the new girl. Yeah. Listen, I have to ask you, do you know if people in the department are taunting Errol? - No. - What about that... the gag with the newspaper? With the circling? No no no, none of us. Wasn't me. No. - Not you either? - No. Okay, I was wrong. All right, well, I'll see you tomorrow at work, Allison. - You have a good... - Well... but, hey? Since I have you on the phone, um, what else can you tell me about Errol? Well, he likes to circle newspapers. Right, I've noticed. - Well, Errol's a good guy. - Mm-hmm. When he started, he was great. - Yeah. - It was this one case... a young girl named Abigail taken, and he got obsessed by the whole thing and, oh, he got in some serious trouble that time. He started carrying a gun around and we don't carry guns. It's not part of our job. Well, thanks, Matt. I appreciate it. - Have a good night. - Good night. She was friendly, outgoing, usually got along with everyone. I don't think she ran away, but if she did, she should really come back. Hey, Harriet, you're on TV. Miss you, Harriet. Please come home. Oh my God! What are you doing here, Errol? Um... uh, I have to tell you something. I have to tell you that... that I have trouble trusting... I have trouble trusting people. Um, even non-registrants. Um... and I apologize for being insensitive to your privacy, even though a background check is not entirely unreasonable. Apology accepted. You were right. We got to narrow down that list. "Daniel Barden: former CPA, husband, father, peeper, rapist, once partnered with Randall Adams." "Carlos Hugo Catalan: unlawful sexual intercourse by fraud or fear, believed to have had different accomplices." "James Ray Ward: solicitation of an individual under the age of 18 to engage in sexual conduct, assault with intent to commit rape, second degree, teamed with Stuart Zimmerman." What are you doing, James? Am I gonna take this to your parole officer? You want me to do that? Is that something I'm gonna have to do? "Viola Gerard: abuse of a minor in a sexual performance, aggravated sexual battery, charged as an accomplice to murder with Paul Gerard, - got out on a plea bargain." - Take care of the registration. disappearance of Harriet Wells, age 17. Reported missing from her parents' home in Paradise Hills... You make a sound, I'll kill you. Hello? No. Well, this is his phone, but Custis isn't here. You can ask, but I'm not gonna tell. Hey, is this Babbage? Yeah. Uh-huh, this is Babbage. Did you get the newspaper? Did you like the circles? # I feel it in my heart # # I feel it in my face # # It's like a boom boom boom, like a boom boom boom # - # Going in my head... # - Don't stop, baby. Glenn Custis! - Custis! - # I need your love... # Who the fuck are you? I'm looking for... for Glenn Custis. Are you sure? Are you Glenn? Glenn Custis! Errol! Custis! Get in the car! Get in! Ahh! I got friends in low places. Isn't that right, Louis? What are you doing here? I just wanted to see how the new job is shaping up. I hear you do good work. I don't handle the photo center. And the woman who does won't be back until... Who do you think you're talking to? Louis Louis. Let's see, your hobby is photography... boys and girls at play, as I remember. And I do. And I do. Look at that. I don't do that anymore. He says he doesn't do that anymore. Should we believe him? People get well. Not my people. She thinks she knows you, Louis, but she doesn't, does she? - No. - No. No. This room is the only reason you took this shitty job. Tell her. Do you think that's the missing girl? Do you think that's Harriet? Not unless she has two left feet. There are at least three people here, probably more. Do you think he did this? Did he cut these women? I think he has a friend in a funeral parlor or a morgue. He probably did the carving. l... I don't get this. Well, you're probably holding it wrong. Yeah, like a centerfold. Porno, you know. This is all porno. Just porno. Every bit of it. No. - I'd like you to see these. - No, I can't. I want you to see this girl. - Is it Harriet? - No. They're staged, all of 'em. He didn't touch her face. The real thing isn't so pretty. I saw Custis back at his house. He was 10 feet away from me, Errol. Does that mean anything to you? That could have been me, only for real. I'm scared of Custis. Yeah, I am. But you know what, Errol? I'm also scared of you. You have blindsided me at every turn and that has got to stop. Yeah. Do you think Custis knows anything about Harriet Wells? Tomorrow we can ask him. Do you think we can find him? One of our flock is gonna know where he is. Haines Ownby... four counts solicitation of underage individual to engage in sexual performance. What's he doing here? It's his feeding ground. Doing some shopping, Ownby? Well, there's a sale on panties. Men's department. You might wanna check that out yourself. I'm looking for Glenn Custis. She might know where he is. You know where I can find her? You know, I don't do that type of thing. Violence turns my stomach. Oh, I forgot, yeah. Did you hear I'm being put out to pasture. Did you know that? Now someone wants to take what's left of the man in me. They've been fucking with me, trying to break me. And I feel that if they do, and I don't find a certain missing someone... we're going to lose Errol Babbage as we know him. He will emerge as a total stranger, and then all of us will have to take our chances and someone might get hurt. Well, maybe I've seen her around, and I could make a call. Yeah yeah, thank you. My name's Errol. What's yours? - Nadine. - Nadine, nice name. I'm going to ask you something. I work for the city. I'm looking for someone... this is kind of important to me. Is this you? Fuck off. I think this is you. - It looks to me that that is you. - No, it's okay. Did Glenn Custis take these? - All right, I'll catch you later. - Okay. - If I tell you, will Glenn find out? - No no, I promise. I don't know where to find him, but I can tell you how he found me. Okay. The lady that cuts my hair. What did you do, go shopping? You stay away from here, you hear me? Yeah, I got a new tie. What do you think? Did you know Custis and Viola Gerard know each other? Yes. Did you know he's been hanging around her beauty salon? Viola. Is Viola here? No, her chair's been empty the last couple of days. Of course he would hang around the salon. He can watch the girls get their hair done, their nails done, hands, feet. Do you think one of those girls is Harriet Wells? Look, Viola was on the passenger side. Custis was the driver. Harriet recognized Viola. That's why she got in. Errol, look at this. That's what's wrong with the registry. We don't just alert the public. We alert every degenerate in the country. You think Custis found Viola on the registry? I think they found each other. Is that the bed? Is that the bed from the photos? Looks like it. She's running a fan club. So that's the team. Custis is the photographer. Custis hooks up with Viola, mistakes her for a kindred spirit. She tells him about the fan mail. So Custis has the idea for this fan club setup. They find some girls and they take some photos, but that just turns Custis on. So now he needs the real thing. He forces Viola to help him abduct Harriet. They find some girls, they take some photos. Errol, look at this stuff. It's unbelievable. "Dear Mrs. Gerard, my heartfelt condolences for your husband's senseless execution. And I thought I was misunderstood. Would it be possible to pay my respects in person?" It's always the same kind of stuff. It's all the same. This is a family restaurant. There are children present. Well, maybe we're exhibitionists. Maybe we like it that way. Exhibitionists expose themselves usually to make an impression with an otherwise unimpressive cock. Now what you are is an agoraphiliac. You get turned on by having sex in public. You need to shock strangers in order to boost your otherwise deficient genital prowess, to beef up your beef... so to speak. Hey, get the fuck out of here. Fucking pervert. What the fuck is your problem, huh? Don't you get it? Get the hell out of here. Harriet called her mother today from California. She wasn't abducted, Errol. She's a runaway. - He's getting killed. - You wanna let me in on the damn joke? Allison. There's a direct connection between at least one of our registrants and that missing girl Harriet Wells... Glenn Custis and Viola Gerard. They're both AWOL. And Errol led you to this conclusion? Yes, it was his investigation. Harriet called her mother today from California. She called? Mm-hmm, I mean, they're following up, but she is now just a runaway. Did you tell Errol? Yep. Well, looks like he's cleared out his desk. It's all yours. So why don't you start your job over before you lose it? We got two missing registrants. Begin with finding them. So that's it? I mean, for Errol? Errol says he can tell when someone's offending or about to offend. They get all hyped up. They start drinking too much, stop grooming. And look at him. Could be his own profile. So, yeah, that's it for Errol. Fucking Babbage came by! How did that happen, you fucking asshole? How did it happen? Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Stay quiet. Just trust me. I'll protect you. It's okay, baby. Shh! If they come... if they come, just stay calm. - I promise you. I promise you. - Hey! No no! No! No! If I asked you, you think you could make a phone call? You could say you're in California alive and well. I don't know. Could you make it sound convincing? Put the gun down, Errol. Put it down! Custis and Viola have Harriet Wells, and I don't care what she told them... Get the fuck out of my house! Get out! I'm sorry. Look at these. We thought that these... all of these were taken at Viola's house. They weren't. They were taken here. - Look at this. - Stop it, Errol. Look, you see that? It's the same, the same bed. - It's the same bed. - Stop it, Errol. This is where it happened, at the site of the original murders. That's where it was. See, that's where they go. - Viola... she lived here in this house. - I'm not listening to this. Her and Paul, they lived right there. - That's where they've taken Harriet. - I don't care! - I don't care. - Harriet is here. - Harriet... - Stop this! You have to stop this. Please leave! Get out, get out! Shit, Errol, what are you doing? I don't know. You have to let it go, Errol. You have to let it go. You've done your best. A girl didn't come home. Lots of girls don't come home... a hundred a day. Sometimes I think I could have done better. Let it go. Because sometimes I think... Think about what? Think what, Errol? Sometimes I think about hurting them. And when you say hurting, you mean killing. Someone has to pay. I gotta take a trip. This girl didn't come home. I'm gonna bring her home. Are you coming? You have to promise me something... that this is your last trip. Say it. This is my last everything. #Ooh, you come on like a dream # # Peaches and cream # # Lips like strawberry wine # # You're 16, you're beautiful... # - How can you do this to me? - Hey, shut the fuck up! I'm singing. # Ooh, what a girl, eyes that sparkle and shine # # You're 16 # # You're beautiful # # And you're mine # # And you're my baby... # Errol! Where is Harriet Wells? Where is she? Is she in there? - I'm gonna go call for help. - It's too late. Where's Harriet Wells? Where is she? Tell me, you motherfucker. # When we kissed, I could not stop # # You walked out of my dreams and into my arms # # Now you're my angel divine... # Stay back. Where's Custis? What have you done? That's it. They were here. Oh, shit! Shit! It's a girl's hand. - Flashlight in the car. - Yeah, I'll go get it. I'll pick the car up. Errol... I don't think it's Harriet. I don't. Come here. Look at her tooth. # Why does the sun # # Go on shining? # # Why does the sea # # Rush to shore? # # Don't they know # # It's the end of the world? # It was Grooms with Viola. He moved here for the sole purpose of meeting her. He probably paid Custis to help with Harriet. They could be anywhere. We need help. What do you want, Errol? I want my 18 years back. You and people like you have wasted my life. If I'm disposable... so are you. Viola Gerard and Edmund Grooms have strayed! They've taken a girl and disappeared. Just like that. Not so easy. Brought some kind of help. Carlos, did you help them? Did you help them? Did you help them? Did you? Did you? This is gonna get very very messy now. - Here, Louis. - Someone tell him! Crawl! Put your hand up here. - You know where they are? - No! Stop stop stop! Stop stop, man, stop. I think I know where they are. I do. I know where they are, man. Harder. # Why does my heart # # Go on beating? # Harder! # Why do these eyes # # Of mine cry? # Done! # It's the end of the world... # Fucking stubby fingers. # It ended when you said # # Goodbye. # It's time, Edmund. Can't we just leave her? Now you sound like Custis. Edmund! Come to me, your worm. Come to me, come to me now. On your knees. Crawl! Faster! Fucking faster, you fucking hear me? Cut, cut, cut! Shut your fucking mouth! I will cut your air off! - Which one is it? - I'm not sure. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's Custis. I'm out. Leave a message. Hoot! Keep calling. It's so good. More! Do it! Get the big knife. Get the big knife! Shh! Shut your fucking mouth! - It's Babbage. - Where? It's Babbage! Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Shut the fuck up. Fuck. Hey, it's Custis. No, please. Hey, it's Custis. I'm out. Leave a message. Hoot! Put it down! He killed Harriet. Just put it down. I was trying to help. I didn't mean to hurt him. She's not dead. Get the fuck out, you crazy fucking... Drop... drop it! - Is she okay? - Yeah. Get down. Down down. Shut up! Give me the gun. Up! You're enjoying this. You gonna return her to her parents? Take me.
