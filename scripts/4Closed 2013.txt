Everything is so expensive . It's awesome God. What do you say ? Wait? To stay in California ? Well, then I'll find a job that is closer to home. The new job doesn't pay anything anyway. I'm make 1/2 of what I did before. You need this job. We need this job! I don't mind the drive. I do. We will find a house. Don't worry. One more. OK. This is not what I was expecting, from what the realtor told us. There is no way that this house will sell at this price. Even if it's foreclosure. Let's look around. Wow. Doesn't look like there's a lot to fix. Wow. Wow look at this. It's so pretty. Oh my goodness. Oh! I didn't mean to frighten you. I'm sorry. Hi I'm Lydia Mullens. I live right next door. Oh hi I'm Jake. This is my wife Ally and my daughter Christine. Hi, whoo lovely young lady I love your hair. Are you interested in this house? Yeah yeah we are interested in buying it. I mean it seems like the previous owner took good care of it. Yeah, well I guess you can say that. Sounds like you didn't like him much. I don't like to say anything bad about anybody, but he was a nasty man. Yeah. Nasty. Granted his mother was dying. That's no reason, that's no excuse for everything. Well he's gone now. Yeah Thank goodness. Ah. Here's the realtor now. Hi guys! I'm so sorry I'm late. Of course I grabbed the wrong set of keys. Didn't realize it till I was half way here. Hi! How are you? Good to see you. Hi. Hi guys. Hi. Hi, well I'm Lydia and I live next door. Oh Hi. Fantastic. I'm gonna let you guys go. Bye. Bye. We'll see you later. Alright guys. Well I got the keys now. Shall we? Let's. Now as I said before, this property is not even listed yet. But the bank wants to move quickly. This is an amazing deal. It would normally go for twice as much. Ah. Beautiful! Isn't it? I know. Spacious. Lots of space. Lots of space. Look at the fireplace. Oh my gosh. Oh cool. You can have a giant party here. And the house note is just going to be in your name, correct? Yes, for now. You are going to love the master bedroom. Not bad. Here we are. The master bedroom. Wow. - Again huge! - Beautiful. And if you're home alone... Hear all the doors lock. And the windows too. The former owner was something of an electronics wiz. Besides the alarm system downstairs, He custom installed a state of the art security system throughout the entire house. All the windows and doors can be locked by pressing that one little button. See. So you can relax in peace. Wow. Alright, well here is the dinning room and the living room. What's with the piano? The previous owners left pretty quickly but the piano takes special movers so they left it behind. It's all yours if you want it. We'll take it. Excellent decision. Congratulations! Welcome to your new home. Wow. What do you think dad? Uh... It's a big house. It's gonna take a lot of up keep. But, you made a good deal. I'm happy for you honey. Thank you. And, hopefully we don't have to move again. Hopefully not. We will not move again. Come on. Come on. Jake. Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my daughter's house? Wait a minute! This is my house. And now you're trespassing. Now get the hell out of here and don't make me tell you again. I'm going to throw this bastard out on his ear. No no no no. Call the cops. These files have been filed by an attorney and they bear the county seal. They look official to me. But these are her papers from the bank. I understand that. I suggest you go down to the county clerks office, and get their opinion. Cause based on these conflicting documents, We can't make any type of judgment or take any kind of action. If you head over to the courthouse right now, you should make it in time. I'm sorry there wasn't more we could do for you. Have nice day. Have a good day. Yeah you too. Ok. Go with grandpa. You guys know where to go right? Yeah Yeah. We can take it from here. Come on. We'll see you later honey. See you later pop. Do you still like vanilla milkshakes? No. Hi. We need help. We bought a foreclosed house legally through the bank. We went to move in today and the previous owner was still there claiming the house is his. Did you call the sheriff's Department? Yeah they came out but apparently this guy had an attorney and he filed some papers saying that he still owns the house. Can I see your paperwork? Yeah thanks. Forest. Hayes. Ok. Here it is. Forest Hayes was the previous tenant. But he was not the home owner. Forest is not the owner. His mother was but she's deceased. So it seems like what his attorney Martin coughlin is trying to do, What he has filed... He's claiming that Mr. Hayes never received the notice of default on the house payments. So he has filed for a wrongful eviction. Is there anything we could do? We, look. It's a bunch of BS. It's never gonna hold up. Oh Thanks Thanks. So, let me tell you what you do. You're gonna go next door to the sheriff's station. You're going to file, an unlawful detainer. Ok. They you are going to take them, you're gonna show them all this paperwork. And the sheriff's will have plenty of ground to evict Mr. Hayes. The sheriff's will throw him out. Great! Thank you so much. Good luck. Thank you. Really appreciate it. Right here. Right here. Normally it can take 3 months to a year to evict someone. 3 months to a year. No no no. Our daughter starts school on Monday. We can't wait 3 months- Yeah, well that's how long it takes, Im so- Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on here. I can't stand this attorney. Always giving me so much bull in court. You know what? I'm going to push this through for you. Oh that'd be great. Well it's still going to take a few days though. A few days. Ok. Good. What you need to do is, you need to get you a hotel for a few days. Till we can work this out. Alright? Ok. Thank You. What a day. What do you mean by that? Enough. Something has to be said here. Ok? The truth has to be spoken. Next time you want to buy a house, why don't you check? to see if somebody else owns it before you buy it. And then you won't put my daughter and my granddaughter in this position. Bud I haven't had a drink in 143 days. Wonderful. Over 3 months. Yeah that's good. What else do you want from me? I don't want anything from you ok? You'll put my daughter and granddaughter in a terrible position ok? And that's just honest. I'm just telling the truth. It's just HONEST! Honey. Jake. We should have never moved. Are you ok? I just wish grandpa wouldn't talk to dad like that. It's just... No, no he shouldn't. He just cares about us, and he doesn't want us to get hurt. Get hurt by dad? I mean he drank but he was always a good father. How's school? Did you check out the Teen Anon web site? Mom. I am not going to do the Teen Anon Website. Kids with alcoholic parents, that's just awkward. Come on. I just need to do the profile. How did you come up with that? She's the heroine of the book. hmm. O.C. Christine? Where did that come from? You're from the O.C. It's cool to be from Orange County. If you say so. Ok. Height. An d Weight. No bodies business. Yeah no. Hair. Beautiful Brown. And eyes. Stunning Brown. I love you. Jake answer your phone. Hello? Yeah this is he. Seriously? No, Thank you. No. No that's for calling. They're evicting him today. He's gone. He's outta there. Yes! Ah! Finally. Some times the good guys win. Ladies and gentlemen of the media, I have requested your presence here today At my client's home, to exemplify an all too common practice. Forcing people out of their homes and onto the streets because they are the victims of sometimes tragic circumstances. Circumstances beyond their control. Shouldn't the banks be helping people retain their property? Huh? NO! Instead, the slightest problem they toss them to the streets. Now Mr. Hayes terribly distraught with the loss of his mother, made a simple mistake. People loss it sometimes. Don't under estimate- Alright! Alright. That's enough! Pack in those cameras. Cameras off. Excuse me, what is this? We are serving you and your client an eviction. The Turners have rightfully purchased this property. Your client has the last 15 minutes to get what he has left in that house and vacate the premises. I suggest you do as the good office says Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes you said your mother left you the home. According to the county clerk's office she did not. In fact, she clearly indicated the bank was to assume ownership of the home, And all assets donated to charity. The house is the property of the bank, and rightfully sold to the Turners. They own the home. If you would have been honest with me in the 1st place, I would never have represented you. I suggest you do as the Sheriff says, and move your belongings and vacate the premises This is very embarrassing. My client lied to me. He's all yours. Excuse me. Sir, you got ten minutes to get whatever you have left in there and get out. No. This is my property. Excuse me? This is my property. Look, I'm trying to do you a favor, Alright? I own this house. Sir, you got ten minutes to get your stuff out of there. Get off my property. Do you want to go to jail? Huh? Is that your vehicle in the driveway? You're going to walk over there. You're going to get into it. Drive away and you will not return. Do we have an understanding? Do we have an understanding? Alright. What are you doing in my car Mr. Hayes? I thought you were going to get my house back? As I said to you earlier this afternoon, had you been more honest in your disclosure to me perhaps I would have. But seeing that you were less the truthful, you're going to have to deal with the ramifications. I must insist you leave my car now! If you do not I will notify the authorities and I don't think this time they will just let you drive away. Even more, Get up! What the hell is wrong with just an old fashion dead blot. Must be written in Chinese. Originally. So, I just got off the phone with the security company turns out we have to have the previous owner's authorization before we could change the code. So there is no alarm till we get all this sorted out. Ah! You got moved in! Oh wow. Good to see you again. Good to see you. You got rid of that boy. He is a very shifty character. Yeah he's a bad seed. This is my dad. Bud. This is Lydia. Lydia. Lydia. Oh have you met Lydia Did you know that the previous owner had moved back in? It wasn't a surprise to me at all. Forest Hayes was always kinda strange. How so? Well he lived in this house with his mother as long as I can remember. Forest had an electronic shop which he had a lot of trouble keeping open. So eventually he closed and then he moved in here. She often asked him to leave but no he won't. So, uh are you going to be here often? Oh yes. I'm the home handyman. I'm here fix all the minor stuff, the minor repairs. Like that stupid system there which is a binary system without the proper matrix for it. Dad. She doesn't understand you. I think she understands me perfectly. I've got to go to work. Bye. Lydia I will see you later, right? Oh yes. You know I gotta go too, I just remembered I have a cake in the oven.

Miss Mullens I'm just looking at my house. Your house? Yeah. That's not your house. I grew up in it. I know. It's not your house. Yes it is. No it's not. Yes it is. That's it. No. I'm calling the police. Miss Mullens don't do that. Miss Mullens don't do that. What's happening? I don't know. I saw the lights. Oh no. Are you acquainted with Miss Mullens? Is that Lydia? How well did you know her? When I came to see my daughter we would speak. That's Lydia? Looks like she must have suffered a heart attack. Her sister found her this morning. Thanks for your time. I never even got to know her. I'm sorry. I don't understand it. This is odd. What is? This is not supposed to be wired this way. It's like all jerry rigged. I don't understand it.

Did you steal that from me? No No, I won't do that. I'm not a thief. I went to your place the other day to talk to your parents about trying to get my place back. I walked out at the yard and looked down, and there it was. I never see you with anybody. Why is that? Hey. Hey I know what it's like. I don't have any friends either. Still don't. Anyway. I'm not a bad guy. I'm not. Just that house is all I have. I grew up in that house. I don't have any friends. I've been sleeping in that truck over there. Anyway. Let's put this pack to the rightful place where it belongs huh. Don't go loosing that again. Cause then I'd have to come looking for you. And your parents won't like that. You go run along now ok. Hi. Look. You found it! Where was it? I found it in the cafeteria. Ah, so happy! How was school? It was ok. Ok? Did you see your boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend mom. Leave it alone. Ok. I'm sorry. I'm just playing with you. Do you want to go shopping? New clothes? Ok. Yes. Ok. Let's go shopping. Look at you. I like it. What do you think? Do you think I look fat? No. You are a very beautiful girl. Look at me. You are very pretty. And you have to believe that. Hmm. You want to get it? I'm sorry your card had been declined. Do you have another card? Declined? You said we had money for this. I do. I have money in this account. Can you try again? That's what came up. Let me try it again. Same thing. That doesn't make any sense. This is ridiculous. Something is wrong with the machine. Sometimes the wires come loose on these contraptions. Let me see the card. I'm sorry. Unless you have cash or another way to pay. We'll be back. Hey honey. What's wrong? I thought I could trust you? What? What now? Our bank account is empty? What the hell is all this stuff? You tell me? I don't know what this crap is? I don't gamble. I don't either. I have an addiction but it's not gambling. And I'm sober. I can't explain it if I don't know what it is. I don't know where this stuff came from but it's not me. What? I told you Jake you had one more chance. I've given you many many chances. That one more time something like this happen, One more time. What does that mean? Huh? Your gonna divorce me? Well? For this? It's been going on and on, and on and on. Everything is me. You never trust me. Never trust me. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it. Not me. Hey Christine, what are you doing? I was just thinking about you? Really? I saw you at school today. Why didn't you say hi? Because... You seemed really busy. I've been dealing with a lot of stuff lately. My parents are always fighting. Yeah, my parents fight a lot. I just try to get outta the house when that stuff happens. Where to? I don't even have a car or anything. Hey we should meet somewhere some time. And talk, you know in person. Maybe a movie? Umm, I don't know if I can. It's kinda silly for us to be chatting. I mean, I don't even have video on my computer. We've been doing this for a while don't you think? Wouldn't you like to meet in person? There is that new Jayden Smith movie I want to see. Yeah. Ok, I'll have my mom drop me off. I can pick you up. You have a car? Yeah, what's the address? It's 3150 French Court. I'll send it to you. I can't wait to finally meet you. Me too. Bye. Just let me know when you're ready pal. Your not going to a different seat are you? I thought we could have a little talk. I don't have anything to talk to you about. Hmm. Well I hope you brought cash. Being that your credit cards don't work anymore. What did you say? What do you know about that? Hey! What do you know about that? I know about a lot of things. Yeah? Like what? Well.. I know Christine is having a tough time in school making new friends. It's just so hard. It's tough on kids when your dad is a drunk. I also know, that little noise that Ally makes. What noise? You know. When you're giving it to her. I love you. Hey! What's going on here?! You want to make fun of my wife? Whoa whoa whoa whoa. I saw him drinking and I asked him if he wanted a drink. This guy. I think you broke my nose. Man I'm sorry. You don't understand- You want me to call the cops? You sure your alright? I'ma need you to leave or else I'ma call the cops on your ass. You stay away from my family. Jake. Your home. Oh is this about Martin Coughlin? again? Sir, did you do this to Forest Hayes? That's impossible. I hit him once. Where was it? I was sitting at a bar for lunch. Wait. Wait Wait. In a bar? It's not a bar. It's a restaurant that has a bar. Look, Forest came in and started talking about all these sort of thing he couldn't possibly know. He's setting me up. Sir. We're going to have to take you in. - Please turn around. Place your hands behind your back. - This is ridiculious. Your under arrest for assault and batery. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and it will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you could not afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights as I've read them to you? It's ok honey. I didn't do any of this ok. Sir do you understand these rights? Sure. What happened? Where are they taking day? No mom, What happened? Why is dad getting arrested? I have to go to the station. Ok. It's all a mistake. Do you hear me? Do you understand? Now, what I need you to do is to stay home. Stay by the phone. And I will be back. Ok? Stay here. I love you. I'll be back. Hello? Hey, Are you still there? Yeah, um... Can you come over now? Sure. Is everything ok? Yeah, it's just, I really need someone to talk to. Great. I'll be there in a little bit. Ok. Coming. Hi Christine. What are you... What are you doing here? You're not suppose to be here. I thought you wanted to go to the movies? Your... Matthew. I'm Deputy Dolin, and I will be facilitating your conversation with Deputy Drew. Where is Jake? We are going to hold on to him for a few hours. Why? This is crazy! My husband has never hit anyone in his life. There is no way he could have beat up that man. Well according to the arresting deputy, Jake admitted hitting Forest Hayes. I know my husband. He would have never hit anybody like that. I am telling you. Forest Hayes is lying. Something happened to him and he's using it to blame Jake. Why would he do that? I don't know?! Look, Jake has given us the name of the restaurant where all this happened at. I guess there is a bartender there who saw it all go down. Well send a unit over to try and get a hold of this guys. Get a statement. If it all checks out we'll cut Jake loose. Ok. So when are you going to go? I'm not going. We'll send a patrol unit. Ok, well when are they going to go? As soon as one is available. It's not exactly a priority. My husband sitting in jail for something he didn't do is not a priority? No it's not and I'm sorry. Look. Mrs. Turner we are going to try to get your husband out as soon as we can. But in the mean time, I suggest you make a few phone calls and try to find an attorney for him while you wait ok? Alright. Certain things go together. There's combustion. Kinda like your family moving into my house. Christine? Here's your chance to scream for help. Why are you calling me? HELP! HELP ME PLEASE! SOMEBODY- Text Me. PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME! PLEASE. Christine! Christine! Christine! Honey. Christi-! You looking for Christine? What are you doing here? Where is my daughter? Sit down. No. I said sit down. Please. Please. Where is my daughter? I will do anything. What do you want? I want my house back. I want my house back that you stole! I did not steal from you! I bought it! Do you understand me? Where is my daughter? Where is my daughter. Shut up! You want your daughter? Do you want your daughter? You give me my house back and I'll give you your daughter. You can't be serious. Look familiar? Sign it. No. Sign it or I will kill her! Ok, I will. Follow me. Do not move. Do not move. Don't you do it. Right up here. Let's go. Let's go ok? Hey officer. Officer. Did they find that bartender yet? Just like your wife. No, no one has gone down to the restaurant yet. When is that gonna happen? It's not a priority. This is ridiculous for me to be in here for something I didn't do. You admitted it. Did you or did you not admit to hitting Forest Hayes? I hit him 1 time. But I didn't beat him up like you saw on that picture. So come on. How about that phone call. Ally? No no it's Jake. Did they release you? That bail cost me $3,000 dollars. No. They can't release me. They are still processing the bond. I'm stuck here at the station. Look, Bud I tried calling Ally alright. I tried texting her. She's not answering. They are giving me one more chance. So please, first of all I swear to you. I didn't beat that guy up. I hit him once. And he had it coming. But anyway, I've just been sitting here thinking and I know I'm being completely paranoid but I think that somehow Forest Hayes might be causing all of this. All of it. All the problems. The problems with the bank account. The credit cards. And all the stuff he said at the restaurant. There are things that no way he could know unless Unless what? I know this sounds crazy, It's like he's there. Unless he's got microphones or cameras. Remember he had that electronic shop? And he installed that auto lock system? And I keep finding foot prints all over the place but I think somehow that guy is getting in our house. So I need you to get over there before Alley and Christine get home. And just stay with them until I get out of here. Bud, Bud, I need you. Ally and Christine need you. And I can't be there. Yeah, I hear yeah, I'm on my way. Thank you. What was your reason for wanting to execute a quit claim deed on the property? Too much work. What's too much work? Purchasing a foreclosed property. It's a lot of work. Oh. Yeah. It can be a lot of work, That's for sure. Especially if the previous owner didn't take care of the property. I just need to see your I.D. Um, your driver's License. This address does not match the once on the deed. We didn't get a chance to notify the DMV yet, we just bought the property no so long ago so. Can you make an exception? Oh, honey. Um... It's ok. I can go ahead and notarize them and it won't be a problem. I just need you to sign here. And there for me. Ok. So if you could put your fingerprint right here. Right there. I'll stamp this. And you'll be off to the county clerks office now. And then you'll be all done. Thank you. Give me my daughter. You take me to my daughter. What did I say? Mom. Christine. Where are we? I don't know. We have to get out of here. How? Oh my god. We're in our house. What? We're in our house? Yes. We have to leave. I got it. I got it. Hurry mom. He's coming. Hurry mom. He's coming. You guys know where you are? You're in dream house. My dad built a bunker. Nooks never came. As you can see I kept my word. Dear Jake. I'm filling for divorce. I'm taking Christine with me. Furthermore, I want to right the wrong that I have done. I have signed a quit claim deed. So Forest Hayes can get his house back. It's such a tragedy, you not being able to get your drinking and abusive behavior under control. Ally. That's the note that the police are gonna find in your car. It's gonna look like Jake rigged the house with explosives. After he found out that you filled for divorce. Then he's going to kill himself. And you two. You are a free man. Bartender came through; Identified Forest Hayes and what went down. Still don't know what's going on between the two of you. He's trying to get his house back. See this? This is my new house. It's pretty isn't it? I know, I designed it myself. Why? I didn't want to have to be a bad guy. I didn't want to have to blow it up. But you ruined it. You and your family. You soiled my house. My memories. I'm not a bad guy. But when someone takes something that is not theirs, I strike back. I take what's mine! I got the house totally watched. Either one of you tries to escape, I push this button. Right here. You won't make it past the blast radius. Christine? Hey! Hurry! Come on. Hurry Mom. There's got to be a way to get out. I need you to go to the neighbor's house. Call the police. Relax. Relax. I'm scared mom. Me too. You have to do this. You have to be strong. Ok Ok. I'll see you there. I love you. Go go go go. Bud, it's Jake. Would you call me when you get this? I want to make sure you're on your way. Take a left on country side. That's faster. Dad? Dad! Dad! Are you ok? Yeah Pills. Pills.
