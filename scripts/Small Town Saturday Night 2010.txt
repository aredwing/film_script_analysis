We're starting to get into that part of the summertime when it's really warm. It's gonna heat up big time today and it's gonna stay this way for the rest of the week. If you're gonna be taking the kids up on the McKenzie today, it's a great idea, but always think safety. Remember, there's a lot of stores right along the McKenzie. Stop in, maybe pick up life vests for the kids. Yeah, you can borrow them for the day. Don't forget that. You can borrow them for the day. Use them and bring them back to the shop. Another thing to remember is... Fuck. This is good. Thanks, Jerry. I'll see you around. I ain't here to bust your balls if that's what you're thinking. Well, I ain't here to kiss your ass if that's what you're thinking. Listen, man. Look, I'm not the judge. All right? I'm just the deputy. Let's shake hands and just put this behind us. Come on. I'll just give you a lift into town. Why don't you take off that badge and see if you still wanna shake hands then? Yeah, that's about what I thought. You stay away from them, Donny. I mean it. - Hey, babe. - Morning. Come here. You're up early. Yeah. I had this melody stuck in my head. You think you can get off early today?

She'll have us. It's all gonna work out. I promise. But Megan needs her father. That's bullshit and you know it. I've done more for that girl in the past two years than Tommy ever has. Rhett, come on. - Hold on! - I need my fucking gas pumped. - Travis, can't you help me out here? - With what? I need some help over here, for Christ's sake. So what, you're just gonna go? I'm sorry.

What do you want? - Assholes! - Hey, fuck you! - You want some advice? - No. Happy is happy and shit is shit. You need to figure out which is which. What the fuck? Good grief, you're-- you're just like my wife. - Oh, shut up. - Yeah, she sits on the goddamn couch. She'll eat a gallon of ice cream and then she cries to me about getting fat. You see, I tell her it's a simple mathematical equation. Less calories consumed, more calories burned-- that equals weight loss. But does she want a solution? No no no. Not to that problem. She'd rather me just sit there and listen to her bitch and moan. What-- what are you doing? All right, honey, this is the part where you start to cry. Oh, shut your trap. All right, let me get this straight. He just marched up to the house and started punching Rodney for no good reason? Yeah, that's exactly what happened. And you guys didn't provoke him in any way? No! He's fucking crazy. That's it. I am filing a restraining order. - I'm sick of this shit. - Ange, I understand. Tommy, you'd better do something. All right, you wanna press charges too, Rodney? Hell, yeah, I do. You guys are just gonna have to go down to the station and file a report. Jesus Christ. You guys have a nice day. Yeah, well, thanks for nothing, Columbo. - Leslie. - What? I just got off the phone with Joanne from the church. And she was telling me that her niece is staying with her and that she is going to be attending the junior college this fall. - That's neat. - Well, I was thinking that since... you're gonna be taking some classes down there too that maybe the two of you should meet. - Yeah, sure, whatever. - Really? Good. I'm gonna go call her and tell her yes. Wait, Mom. Mom, wait. Mom! Mom, are you sure she's pretty? - Hey, Rhett. - Hey, Donny. Hey. Your old man ain't here. - Where is he? - Hell if I know. So you're out, huh? Yeah. - Well, it went by fast. - Not for me. What was it like? lt sucked shit. You been all right? Thought you'd be outta here by now. So did I. I wish I could do that-- just leave this shithole town, never come back. It's gonna be hard to leave. Why? Fuck this place. My whole world's here. You're lucky, you know? You got a reason to leave and a reason to stay. I ain't got shit. - Has your number changed? - Absolutely not. God, you look good, girl. All right, I'll call ya. All right. That's all they had.

I'm not gonna mount you. - What's up, buddy? - How you doing, man? - Good to see you, Tommy. - You too. I heard you boys had to referee a little boxing match this morning. lt wasn't much of a fight though. - Rodney got his ass kicked. - Yeah? He's a lover, not a fighter. I'd better have Paul deputize you two, seeing as how ugly over here never put that baseball scholarship to use. And Lord knows I could use the help. Looks like you already got some. Yep. How's she doing with all this? A lot better than me, that's for sure. Yeah. I know how you feel, man. I wish I had some advice for you, but... - 210, 210, copy. - So I-- I'd better get. Well, see you guys tonight. - Stay out of trouble. - You too, Tommy. - Use a condom. - Not a chance. Good to go, sweetheart.

Phyllis, what do you want me to do about it? Excuse me. You can't handle this. You can't handle it. You're gonna be on one of these magazines-- Mom! Relax, Leslie. I've seen your tally-whacker before. Don't call me Leslie. I hate it. I'm doing the laundry. I need that too. I'll bring it down to you. Mom... I really don't like your attitude, Leslie. The more you hang around your brother's friends, the more disrespectful you are to me and your father. Hey there. ls your mommy or daddy home? Yeah? Hi. Get your asses back in this house. What did I say? Fuckin' asshole. Come on, you piece of shit. Come on, you son of a bitch. We need the goddamn money now. - I've tried already. - He's right over there. Go get it. It's the same goddamn story with you. I don't give a shit, Darlene. Just stop feeding your goddamn dog my beef jerky. Okay? I seen you try to sneak past me, buddy-boy. - I wasn't sneaking. - Did you get my notice? Yeah, I got it. It's laying on the ground right over there. I'm going to pick up my paycheck. Looks like you're gonna be hoofing it. Well, I better have it in my hot little hands by this afternoon, buddy-boy, or the missus is gonna be over. And you do not want her fat ass all over you. You hear me? Yeah, I fuckin' heard you. You hear me? I said I'm gonna go get my paycheck, then I'll square up with you. You deaf idiot. - He's a goddamn lying-- - Shut up! You touch those kids again, I will make you curse the day your mother shit you out. I don't understand. Why is this so much to ask? Because I already mowed the friggin' lawn. - No cussing. - Phyllis, would you move? And I need to fix the brakes on my Jeep before my date tonight. Couldn't I do it tomorrow? I want you to help your father. And then the two of you could chit-chat a little bit. - You can take the Oldsmobile-- - Phyllis. No, I don't wanna take the grocery-getter. lt smells like Grandma. John, would you talk to your boy? Oh God. Look, Les, just-- just go fix your truck. Thanks, Dad! We can clean out the garage tomorrow. Now will you move, Phyllis? John, I want you to have a serious talk with that boy. This is a very nice girl he's going out with tonight. Well, I'm happy for him. Now move. Aren't you at all concerned... Gotta work itself out, man. You'll figure it out. It's fucking bullshit, man. If it sucks, you'll come back in six months. But you gotta at least fuckin' try it, don't ya? - I gotta fuckin' call her, dude. - You're not gonna call her. Well, what the fuck-- what am I supposed to do, Dwayne? - She's gonna be at-- - What am I supposed to do? We're leaving in two days and she springs this shit on me now? Maybe I... Maybe I should just forget about it and stay here, you know? Are you fucking crazy? What are you gonna do, Rhett? You gonna work at the mill with me and Wade until-- My dad did it. Listen, Rhett. I would give anything to be in your shoes. And I wish I was going with you, but I can't. 'Cause the day I held my little girl in my arms was the day I knew what I was meant to do for the rest of my life. I miss my kids, man. And believe it or not, I actually miss my wife. I know you love those girls, Rhett. I know you wanna take them with you, but Samantha's gotta do what she's gotta do for her daughter. I'm only gonna say this 'cause I'm your best friend, but... but you're not Megan's father. - Got me a hot date tonight, boys. - Dude. - Yeah, right. - I do. You'll see. I just don't wanna see you give up on your dreams because you're holding on to the one thing that's letting you go. Let's fix her up! What's the problem with it? - It's the brakes. - 'Cause you ride them like a girl. I don't know, man. It's been... it's just been real tough. But, man, I... I feel like I'd do you right, you know? I mean, look, Jimmy, I... I'm really trying to get my life back on track, you know? I prom-- You throw everybody's paycheck on the floor like that? Do you really think you deserve this job... Yeah. ...when there's a dozen other guys out there who actually show up for work on time and not half-drunk or not at all because they're in jail again? All right, listen. I ain't got all day. Am I getting my fuckin' job back or not? Not a chance in hell. Hi. You've reached Rhett and Samantha. Please leave a message. Hey, it's me. You there? Sam. Look, I really... I need to talk to you. I'm sorry I overreacted, okay? Will you please call me back? I love you. You know, life ain't always gonna work out like one of your happy horseshit country songs. Charlie Chicken-Plucker's here. Hey, what'd I tell you about working on your own damn car? Better put them tools up. And God damn, who made this mess? Clean this up. And where's the other fuckin' squeegee handle? You got me, Chuck. Well, it's missing, God damn it. How are you gonna clean a customer's window? You gonna spit on it and rub it with a newspaper like a fucking derelict? I'm going to the bank. You better find that other goddamn squeegee handle before I get back. What's her name, molester? We probably know her. No, you don't. She just moved here. Yeah, come on, Leslie. What's this hot chick's name? Her name's Julie. - Julie what? - Yeah, what's her last name? It's Portly. Portly! Yeah. You like that? You like that? - Huh, Julie? - No no, molester.

Sir, you need to stay on that side of the counter. Would you like to make a deposit? I don't wanna make a deposit. Sir, your account is overdrawn. I can't cash this check. You can make a deposit and bring your balance up closer to zero. I don't wanna make a deposit; I wanna cash the thing. Sir, I can't cash this check. Well, then I wanna talk to your boss. Sir, I can guarantee you he's going to tell you the same thing. - It's bank policy-- - I don't give a shit. Get your goddamn boss. Go! I gotta go. I'll call you later. - Bye-bye. - He wants to cash the check. - I'll take care of it. - Fuckin' people. - Hello, sir. - Hey. That's-- that's wrong, by the way.

And the thought of not having you guys around is killing me. She's my world. And if you take her away from me, you're leaving me with nothing. Come on, Les! What the hell is he wearing? All right, let's roll out, fellas. Brakes work. What-- finally! Where the hell have you been? It's cold. What the hell is Doris doing here? I don't know. They kicked me out in the middle of my cartoons. Hey, we're heading out to Pyramid Rock. When you getting off? Rhett, get in here. Rhett, have a seat. Hey, Doris. - Any fries, Travis? - No. What's going on? The bookkeeper has brought it to Doris's and my attention that there seems to be a little bit of a discrepancy in the daily deposits-- you know, just a little bit here, a little bit there. But as of lately, those differences have totaled into quite a hefty sum. Someone hasn't been dipping into the till to, say, prepare for a big move to Nashville or something like that? Doris, I got no idea where that money might be going, but I swear I got nothing to do with any discrepancies, all right? You got a lot of nerve. - Are we going? - No, we're jerking off. - Shit. - What's going on? Hey, am I gonna get fired? Travis. Hey, what's going on? I gotta get the fuck outta here. Why don't you come with us, then? What are they gonna do, fire you? Come with us. - Hey, ladies! - Hi. - Where are y'all headed? - Nowhere in particular. We're heading up to Pyramid Rock. - You wanna join us? - We got lots of brewskis. Dude, who the fuck says brewskis? I saw it in a movie. We don't have our bathing suits. - Perfect. - You coming, Rhett? - No, I can't. - Come on, Rhett, for old time's sake. No, I got some shit I gotta take care of. I'll catch up with you guys later, all right? All right then. You know where to find us. - Yep. - Keep it real, bro. So you guys didn't see or hear anything? I heard the guys leaving in Les's Jeep. Do you think maybe they took him with them? Rough road, huh? How's it going over there, chief? Good. - I'll get to the bottom of this. - Okay. What the hell am I still doing here, T? I've been wondering that for some time now. You gotta be shittin' me. Rhett, phone. Hello. Hey-- Well, no-- just tell me now. Fine, I'm coming over then. - Gentlemen. - Tommy. Deputy. What the fuck did you say to her? - Where the hell are you going? - I quit! You mind taking a ride with me? Something wrong? Let's just talk in the truck. Come on. All right. - When'd you get this rig? - About a month ago. Paul got a new cruiser. I got this one. I ain't rode in a new truck in a while. You seen Donny today? I run into him at the bank earlier. He wasn't too happy to see me. - He wasn't, huh? - No. I think he ran off with Chance this afternoon. You know where he might have gone to? How the hell would I know that? I'm not his keeper. Tsk, he doesn't care what he does to them, does he? I don't know what's in his fool head. I ain't such a bad guy, am I? After I got hired on and I caught Donny doing something stupid, I cut him all the slack I could. - Why? - Hell, I don't know. - I-- - But you know how he is. He's an asshole. Tommy, I really don't wanna be in the middle of all this. What do you call it if you ain't already in the middle of it? Can I go back now? New Country 93. What the fuck is that? What are you doing? Hail hail, the gang's all here... - Drink 'em. - With their ribs full of reefer - And their bellies full of beer... - Knock her off. 16 years of living the dream We're the pride of all our families Hail hail, the gang's all here With their eyes wide open and with minds so clear We're ready it seems to see what it means To be the rulers of our destiny Well, all right. Grandpa thinks I should've married your mama. Hell, I done tried that once with this bitch named Connie. lt didn't work. I don't know. Sometimes I wish everybody'd just mind their own goddamn business. You know what I mean, chief? I wish I was rich. I'd buy you lots of shit, take you on vacations and stuff. How'd you like that? Let's get the fuck outta here. It's hotter than the hubs of hell. Better reel in that line, boy. We're heading in. Rhett, please say something. Rhett. What the fuck do you want me to say? What do you want me to say? That I understand? That I'm happy you're giving your ex-fucking-husband a second chance? - ls that what you want? - No, I...

I don't ever want to look at you and think that you're the reason I took Megan away from her father. Well, what if I was willing to give it all up and stay here with you guys? I couldn't-- I couldn't live with myself and I don't-- I don't think you could either. Rhett, you are gonna thank me for this one day. Don't flatter yourself. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - So am I.

I'm done making excuses for the two of you. You know what Donny's done this time? Don't give a shit. You never have. You two guys are always blaming me for everything that goes wrong in your life. Your mother left all of us, remember? If she's so goddamn special, why didn't she take you with her? See? lt ain't all my fault. So fuck him and fuck you too! You're a sad man, Dad. Run as fast as you are able Please forget where you have been You don't want me at your table So if I knock, don't let me in Now if I knock, don't let me in - 'Cause I am not what you are after... - Shit. And you don't know where I have been You could love me, but I'm not worth it So if I knock, don't let me in Now if I knock, don't let me in Just bury That feeling As deep As you can dig And save it For someone who knows What to do with it. Oh, nice. Still alive, you cockroach? Yeah. I'm a thorn in your side, copper. What are you doing home? Julie got sick. Where's Dad? He's at his Bible study. She got sick? - I'll get it. - Mom, I got it. - I'll get it. - Mom-- Leslie, I'll get it. Ryan residence. Hi, Julie. - How are you feeling? - Tell her I'm not here. Yes, Leslie's right here. You hold on, honey. She is fine and dandy and she wants to know where you are. Hello? Hi. Yeah. I was-- I'm sorry. I was just about to call you. Actually, I'm not feeling so well. Can you hold on for a sec? Thanks. - Will you leave me alone? - I did not raise a liar. Now you tell her you are feeling a lot better, that you are on your way over there and you are sorry about the hold-up. Hey, Julie. Yeah, hey. I'm-- I'm actually starting to feel a lot better. So if you're still interested, I'll be by shortly. Okay. See you soon. Bye. Thanks a lot. - What's wrong? - Mom, I don't wanna go. Why not? We already missed the dinner reservations you made. Well, so then you change them. Mom, you're not listening to me. I do not want to go out with her. Leslie Ryan... are you homosexual? What? No! Well, then why don't you wanna go out with that girl? Leslie, I am worried about you. You never go out with any girls and you have all those half-naked men hanging in your bedroom. You don't have to hide it from me. I'm your mother and I am gonna love you no matter what. Would you leave me the fuck alone? I am 23 years old and you are still trying to run my life. What's wrong with setting you up on a nice date? Look at me, Mom. Look at me. Who's gonna want to go out with me? I'm not like Rhett. What are you talking about? You are a catch. You are handsome. - You are intelligent. - Mom! Look, girls don't like guys like me, especially not pretty ones like Julie. Lord forgive me, but that is a steaming crock of shit. You have a lot to offer that girl. Just fix your collar. Fix your collar a little bit. There you go. Make it smooth. Okay, and just tuck in your shirt a little bit. Look at you. You're my handsome boy. - Ain't it funny... - Les. How one day it's sunny And the next day It's pouring rain? Ain't it strange? You can wake up in LA And by nightfall you're dancing On the beach down in Spain There's so many things I don't understand Like how does a river know which way to flow? How does the wind know which way to blow? Leslie? And how do you know that you know When you know you're in love? These are for you. I dropped them on accident. Sorry. And how does a guy like me Get a girl like you? I just spoke with a senior agent. He said they probably won't charge you with a federal crime since you didn't actually get away with the money. I guess we'll just see what happens at your arraignment. So... Can I get one last request? That's nice. It's pretty. I like that. - Hey. - Hey. - Beer, nice. I like beer. - Thanks, dude. - Kick some ass tonight, all right? - Yep. What the hell is this? It's a gift; it's not a loan. No, I-- I can't take this, dude. You can take it and you're gonna take it. And you're gonna go to Nashville and you're gonna kick some ass and you're gonna make us proud, okay? Yeah. - Good look, bro. - Thanks, buddy. Thank you. Yeah. - So I guess you're going. - I guess I am. I'm gonna go check on that thing. Shit. - Hey. - Hey. How's Megpie doing? She's okay.

I'm really sorry. I know. I know. I just want you to be happy. Well, nothing will make us happier than seeing you make it. We will always be your biggest fans. Okay. Someday I will find - My ticket outta here... - Yeah, Rhett! Get up one morning and just start packin' I make up my mind I'll lay down my fear Stop waitin' for the next bad thing To happen I'm ready for the rainbow to begin I just got through a storm of tears I thought would never end Someday was a dream that always seemed To turn out wrong But now it's not so far away Putting off tomorrow ls 24 hours too long I guess my someday came today Maybe I'll take a train To a place I've never been Where I can watch the sun Fall into the ocean I finally feel alive Throw my heart into overdrive Get up and get this life - ln motion... - Because it's your last night, brother. And I'll do everything I'm meant to do 'Cause I'm past the pain and sorrow That kept it all from coming true Someday was a dream That always seemed to turn out wrong But now it's not so far away Putting off tomorrow ls 24 hours too long I guess my someday came today... You just take care of them, Tommy. That's all I ask. I will. Put this town on the map. That's all I ask. I'll be listening for ya. I guess my someday Came today... Yeah, it came today, yeah.
