""It is agreed with Miles Corbin ""to be herder of cows for Salem Village ""in place of Thomas Bilge, whose habitual inebriation ""renders it needful to divest him of office. ""The said Miles Corbin shall drive ""the milk cattle to the common pasture, ""and bring his charges home before sundown. ""ln consideration whereof, the farmers of Salem Village have this day ""agreed to pay the said Corbin 40 a year."" MARSHAL: Thomas Bilge. Thomas Bilge, the town fathers have this day removed you from office for habitual drunkenness. And have given your charge and staff to Miles Corbin. Praise be. Tomorrow, l"ll just sit on the fence the livelong day and spit at bumblebees. Aye, that"s all you"re good for, Bilge, just spitting at bumblebees. (CLEARlNG THROAT) (HOLLERlNG) (CATTLE BELLOWlNG) He"s welcome to them. Those daft beasties are bewitched. They"ve worn me out with their hollering and bellowing and running into the forest, Iike things possessed. And of what use are they to men? They give naught but milk. To the stocks with ye. And there ye shall sit and meditate on your sins till sundown, Thomas Bilge. Methinks l"ll just sleep. Six for Doctor John and Martha, six for Elder Goode, six for the meeting house, three for Jeremiah Adams. Three? Oh, no. No, Jeremiah spoke for six this week. Six candles for a few lobsters? Besides, how can an old lobster-man living alone with never a gossip in to see him, burn so many candles in a week? Who knows? A bright window may bring him a gossip. Oh, six for Jeremiah. And a piece of cake. Cake, indeed. Let him bake his own. Now, Aunt Ellen, he hasn"t your gift with the oven. ELLEN: Did you wipe your shoes, Timothy? Yes, Mother. Oh, cake for me? Not till supper. But l"m so hungry, l"m weak. Truly? From your great application to learning? What did you learn at school today? Manners. Speak not, sing not, hum not, wiggle not, spit only in a corner. And very good learning, too. Now, wash your hands and finish the candles. But I dipped candles last week. And will again this week. Make haste while the tallow is warm. (GROANS) Oh, dear, are you ill? Shall I take you to Doctor John"s for some ipecac? I"ll be home by sundown. There, the leech has drawn the blood. By moonrise the swelling will be gone. That didn"t hurt very much now, did it? No. I fear not but ipecac. Good day, John. Barbara. Good day, Barbara. Oh, Jasper, fighting again? No, ma"am. I fell from a tree, an apple tree. Next time, lad, pick a tree your own size. Now, be off with you. You"d best keep your good eye open for the Elders. You have a new doctor"s book. Mm-hmm. But that"s not all I brought from Boston. (GASPS) John, you brought it. It will cost your aunt but six shillings. Oh. It"s beautiful. BARBARA: John, do you think I should wear the bow under the chin or at the side? JOHN: Well, the shopkeeper said at the side. BARBARA: The side. Oh, Martha, isn"t it lovely and gay? Yes, very gay, Barbara. Too gay, you think? Nonsense. There"s enough wearing of somber clothing here. But if Elder Goode sees it before the Sabbath meeting, he may forbid the wearing. Oh. And l"m just on my way to his house. Why not leave it here? May l? Yes, of course. Thank you. I can see their faces when I walk down the aisle next Sabbath. Thank you again, John. (DOOR CLOSES) Tituba, Abigail. TlTUBA: And every month in the dark of the moon, the drums would beat, and there"d be a rustle like a great wind and we"d hear them screaming and laughing, and we knew they were all meeting in the jungle. Who, Tituba? Who? TlTUBA: The spirits of the bad ones. And there"d be drinking and feasting and dancing, and suddenly a great fire would shoot up, and Obano himself would appear. Obano? You calls him Satan. Did you see him? TlTUBA: Oh, no, missy. Only a few ever seen him. He come in fire and go in a whirling of wings like bats. Up, up. And when morning come, the trees in that jungle would be dead and the river would be as red as blood. Tituba. You tell the most outlandish stories. You never saw such things. I"d see more than that if I drank the stuff she brews. ABlGAlL: Quiet, Goody. (GRUNTS) You should have been here sooner, Barbara. Tituba told our fortunes. I"m going to travel and meet strange men. MARY: And l"m going to marry a man from Boston. I"m to be a person of importance. I shall be above everyone else and everyone shall listen to me. See what she tells you, Barbara. ANN: Yes, tell Barbara"s fortune, Tituba. Will you? Give me your hand, child. I see a man, tall, well-favored, dark hair. Go on, Tituba. Go on. I see no more. Oh, please. Tituba! GOODE: Abigail, Tituba! It"s Father. Quickly! Quickly! Idleness and gossip! Abigail, to your spinning wheel. Tituba, prepare the supper! Howdy do, Elder. Howdy do. These are not the same weight as the others. Nor are they so strong of bayberry. Your aunt had best be more careful if she expects a full measure of my flax in return. Yes, sir. Tituba, you did go to those feasts in the jungle, didn"t you? No, no, mistress! No! But you did, or you couldn"t know so much about them. Tell me more. Not here. In my cabin, where the master won"t know. Jeremiah! Barbara! I"d forgotten you"d be here today! Did you have any luck? None, child. My traps are as empty of lobsters as the Elders" meetings are of humor. I"ll not be needing any candles this week, so you"d best run along home, child. So, you don"t want candles because you haven"t lobsters enough to pay for them. Nonsense! Come along. Oh, but my cabin is in disorder. I"ve had no time to clean. Then l"ll do it for you. Barbara! Barbara, don"t go in! That chair, it was rocking. The wind, perhaps. Now, child, it"s late. Your aunt will be worried. What is it? Am I not welcome today? Always welcome. Well, then, fetch some water while I get the broom. Oh, but... (SHRlEKS) Glory be. I heard your voice, but I thought you mortal. My nephew, Roger Coverman, from Virginia. Mistress Barbara Clarke. Glory be. Good day to you, sir. And to you, mistress. My aunt will be worried. Barbara, wait. I must ask you, not a word about my visitor. Nay, I cannot tell you why. Faith, but she must know. These tatters, this blood, this bandage. But let me give you the worst of it first. I"m a fugitive, l"m a rebel, l"m a traitor to the Crown. Oh. How interesting. Ah, but wait! You must let me give you the best of it. You see, "twas a little matter of taxes, and being a Virginian and a patriot, I resented it, as did others. The governor resented our objections and we replied with swords. I warrant it was a gallant fight. Gallant? Three hundred of them against 2,000 soldiers, and Roger with his back against the wall, holding off half a dozen. Now, now, now, Uncle, no matter how magnificent we were in defeat, they beat us well, put us to flight and confiscated our lands. But how came you here? A friendly skipper brought me as far as Boston, the rest of the way on foot, through your forests. Hiding by day, traveling by night. With a price on his head of 1,000. Do you think it worth it? Oh, Roger, be serious. There"s scarce a man, even in this colony, who wouldn"t give you up for that sum. I cannot speak for others. As for myself, I have not seen you. Good day, sir. She has not seen me? What does she mean by that? A rebuke, no doubt. Puritans of this colony would hardly approve your speech and manners. If manners they be. Oh! She"s forgotten her basket. Mistress! Mistress Barbara, you forgot your basket. Oh, thank you, sir. And I forgot the candles, and this piece of cake for Jeremiah. When will you come here again? I bring candles once each week. Only once? But l"m a great reader. I read far into the night. We shall have none by sunrise tomorrow. I must gather bayberries before I can make more. Bayberries? Then let me help you. I have an amazing nose for bayberries. I track them down like a hound upon the trail. You might be seen. I could not risk so valuable a head. Ah, "tis not my head that"s in danger now. Truly, when will l see you again? When I bring more candles. Uncle, you old miser of speech. Why did you not tell me of her? To think that she should find me like this. I"m sorry she found you at all. What? Would you ruin my life? Ruin your life? I"m trying to save it, lad. See that you do. From now on, it will be worth the living. A razor, a needle and a bit of mending, and l"ll soon be myself. (SlNGlNG) Bid me to live, and I will live Thy protectant to be Or bid me love... Roger! Anyone within half a mile could hear you. Well, they might ask me to lead the psalm singing next Sabbath. Egad, that"s an idea. She"d be there of course. And I sorely need the comforts of religion. (SlNGlNG) Bid me to live, and I will live And the scripture saith that Satan shall go to and fro in the land, and up and down in it, as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. My brethren, here in this new land, that ancient prophecy is being fulfilled. Satan and his legions are here. The power of God has driven him from the old world into this wilderness, where the ignorant savages were waiting to receive him. Say you, ""What signs are there of his presence?"" Where there is sickness or hurt or other grievous misery, there he is. I bid ye watch! I bid ye fast! And pray God to protect us from the power of Satan. (SlGHS) Speaking of Satan, I also bid ye beware of the frivolity and foolishness of women that bedeck themselves with ribbons, curls and lace bonnets. Thus causing the minds of men to wander. I tell you that a female that will fritter away her time, trimming and tricking herself out in such a fashion, should be looked upon as the mere gizzard of a trifle. The epitome of nothing and a very apt prey for the devil. We will now sing Psalm 8. Elder Cheeves will set the tune. (SlNGlNG) Oh, Lord, our God in all the earth How thy name wondrous great Who hath thy glorious majesty Above the heavens set Out of the mouth of suckling babes Thy strength thou didst ordain That thou might still the enemy And them that thee disdain (MOUTHlNG) You, come with me... (MOUTHlNG) No. You, come with me... A little lower placed And hath with glory crowned him And comely majesty Amen Brethren, before we disperse, I have an announcement to make. One that gives me, personally, a feeling of great happiness and satisfaction. Elder Goode has set next Wednesday for the raising of my new home, which you, dear people, have so kindly given me. Remember, it is more blessed to give than to receive. So let no one forget to bring his or her gift. Good day, Goodwife Nurse. How are you, child? Very well, thank you. It"s good to see so glowing a countenance, even under a bonnet so... So sinful. I"ve asked Miles Corbin to supper. Wait and bring him home with you. (SHUSHlNG) Oh, Miles! (CLEARlNG THROAT) Good day, Barbara. Good day. I"m ready, Miles. Are you coming? I cannot go with you, Susy. I"ve consented to sup with the widow Clarke and Barbara. I should think you"d wait for the man Tituba promised you. What did she mean by that? Oh, she"s just jealous. Aye, and rightly so. Mr. Parris. I was much interested in your sermon today, for in Boston last week, Mr. Cotton Mather told me two women had been arrested at Cape Ann for witchcraft. Satan"s instruments. He promised to keep me informed of any further outbreak. There are several here who could bear questioning. One, anyway. Goody Hodgers? Aye. A witch if ever there was one. The judges were too lenient when she was accused last year. She deceived them with lies. BlLGE: Mr. Goode! Mr. Parris! Mr. Goode! I saw him! I saw him plain. PARRlS: Saw whom? The devil"s own person in yonder forest. Drunk again. No, sir. And on the Sabbath, too. No, sir. I been drinking, but l"m not drunk now. But l"m going to be. I"d sooner see snakes than devils. Well, Deborah will be waiting supper. I"d best be going, too. Good day, Mr. Parris. I"ll go with you, Elder. "Tis like jelly I am with fright. He came right at me! (SCOFFS) I tell you, I saw him. I saw his horns and his tail. Have a care, Bilge, or they"ll arrest you like they did me. Did you see him? They said I did. You better get yourself a charm, Bilge. A charm to keep him away. Do you know a good one? Indian beans are good, worn round the neck. Or a badger"s claw. But the surest charm of all is a necklace, 21 links, each woven of seven hairs freshly plucked from the end of a dog"s tail. (LAUGHlNG) Seven hairs freshly plucked from the end of a dog"s tail. I"ve been thinking, Barbara. Yes? It was you Reverend Parris meant when he rebuked your sex. I fancy it was. You"re a bold piece, Barbara, (CLEARlNG THROAT) with your frippery. What you have need of is a man of character to restrain ye. It"s very kind of you to concern yourself about me, Miles. I consider it my duty, for when I marry, l"m entitled by the colony to take for myself a fine piece of bottom land with a brook on it, and I shall have three horses, six cows, 10 pigs. Ten... That seems an over abundance of pigs. Moreover, the Elders think well of me. The people in the village listen when I talk. One day I shall be an Elder. (LAUGHlNG) Oh, Miles. You laugh too freely, Barbara. After marriage, l"ll not brook such frivolity. Indeed. The Elders have been speaking of you and me as a proper couple, and my mother is of a mind that we should be married soon. Miles, you sweep me off my feet! So, you make sport of the Elders" suggestion? Sport of me? Well, l"ll not be laughed at through supper. Oh, no, Miles! Miles, I did not mean to flout you. Besides, we have chicken for supper. You cannot induce me. Susy Abbot"s a right-thinking girl, and the Abbots always have chicken. Miles. (GROANS) Oh, chicken. Don"t touch. Where"s Miles? Aunt Ellen, please forgive me, but I made a jest. And l"m afraid he understood it. Barbara! And weighing his pride against your good chicken, he decided not to come. Oh, Barbara! You cannot refuse every young swain in the village. It is your duty to marry and have children, to the glory of God and the colony. But would you have me marry a man who boasts only of his fine bottom lands, his three horses, six cows, 10 pigs, and treats me like one of his livestock? Oh, faith! The man is a blockhead. I cannot abide him or his pigs! But the chicken, enough for a family of six. Oh, yes, the chicken. ROGER: Chicken. Ambrosia! Food for the gods! Mistress, you"ve saved my life. Sure I wouldn"t be discourteous to the lobsters of Massachusetts, but to have them for breakfast, dinner and supper. Why, the very expression of a lobster"s eye brings to my mind our red-faced Governor of Virginia. Hail to the colony, I say, but confound the governor. You"ll be confounded yourself if you don"t stay away from the village. As I nearly was today, it was in the shadows of the forest. I came suddenly upon a people-minded villager, and he held up his finger so. Whereupon, I threw my cloak over my head, Ieaped behind a tree and bellowed like a demon. And how that villager ran. He ran so fast, his legs couldn"t keep up with him, so that he fell and rose howling and ran some more. Isn"t it good to hear a man laugh so freely? Aye, we seldom hear it in this place. That"s your penance for living among these Puritans, Uncle. Not meaning yourself, mistress. It"s true they"re not much given to laughter, Roger. And they"ve little cause. "Tis a stern heritage that has come down to them through generations. Yet, in spite of all that, they conquered this land. It took courage to do that, my lad. Listen to him, a sermon in everything he says. But believe me, mistress, he"s a rebel, too. For in Virginia, when they would not let him teach his ideas of a kindly God, he turned rebellious, and now traps lobsters. Your tongue"s too loose, nephew. And you burn too many candles. You"ll excuse me. There, l"ve done it. What? Recalled the old days to his mind. He loved Virginia. (SlGHlNG) I don"t wonder. From what you"ve told me, it must be very gay. We make it gay. We"ve a saying there, ""When danger lurks around the corner, ""you must dance the safe moments away."" Dance? That"s not a Puritan custom, I warrant. Oh, no. Have you never danced? The cotillion, the gavotte? The very names sounds frivolous. The Gavotte"s my favorite. I"ll teach it to you. No, no, no, no, it would not be fitting for me. It"s the most proper dance, I assure you. This is the manner of it. (HUMMlNG) Ah, faith, but you must smile when you dance. One, two, slowly curtsy. ELLEN: Now, the first one. TlMOTHY: I was. You was. You were. Were. He was. You was. Were. Were. I say. You says. ELLEN: Timothy, I fear you will never be a scholar. TlMOTHY: May I go to bed, Mother? Yes. What are you doing? Dancing. Dancing? What are you bowing for? That"s a curtsy to my partner, a very handsome young man. I don"t see any man. You"re not supposed to. Mother! She said she"s dancing with a handsome young man. Get along to bed with you. Go on. Aw... Barbara, you do say the most foolish things. Dancing? And you supposedly a God-fearing girl. I"m sorry, Aunt Ellen. Does no good to be sorry after the deed. Besides, tomorrow is the house-raising. You"d better get your sleep. There"ll be plenty to do. Yes, Aunt Ellen. (SLURRlNG) Here, doggy. Nice, doggy. Here, here, here. Here, doggy. Doggy! (DOG YELPlNG) All safe. Jump. (BOTH LAUGHlNG) This way. (BARBARA EXCLAlMlNG) ROGER: Here we go. (BOTH LAUGHlNG) "Tis an avalanche we are. Did you hurt yourself? I"m shaken to pieces. What did you expect? How was I to know the ground would give way and upset your Puritan dignity? Oh. Well, l"m fast learning how it feels to be a fugitive. Hiding in trees, tumbling down hills. Like a very mountebank. Before long, l"ll have you as cunning as a fox, swift as a deer, leaping from hill to hill. Oh, Roger! Methinks the whole pattern of my life has changed since l"ve known you. Aye, and I can"t say l"m proud of it. "Tis a sneaking feeling I get, dodging and hiding about like a badger in his hole. Must it always be like that for you? Well, I suppose I could send a petition to Their Majesties. Could you? To King William and Queen Mary? What would you say? Well, now, that takes a bit of thinking. I fancy l"d try to appeal to the human side. Now, if I were talking to the King, man to man, I"d say, ""William, can"t you and I come ""to a fair and square understanding? ""You see, there"s a young lady in the case. ""l"d like to see her in proper fashion, to meet her family. ""But how in conscience can I do it ""with your governors chasing me all over the colonies?"" ""Now, just put yourself in my place, William. ""Supposing you were chased out of London ""and had to hide at Dover, by the sea. ""You"d miss your Mary, wouldn"t you? Of course you would. ""Well, it"s the same with me, but worse. ""For, mind you, though l"m not saying a word against your Mary. ""The young lady I have in my mind is the most fascinating, ""twinkling, dark-eyed maid that ever took an honest man"s breath away."" Now, whisper, what would you say to that? I"d say... I"d say I had to gather herbs and get to the house-raising. But that"s not what l"ve been asking. I must hasten. Now, men, get ready. Take hold! One, two, three! "Tis the best raising we"ve had, Rebecca. Well, I want to know. Barbara and Doctor John. The whole village working, and we"re the only idlers. A choice bit of gossip for Mrs. Cheeves. Her day would be spoiled if she did not have something to babble of. John. Don"t say you found me on the shore road. Why not? Because... ELLEN: Barbara! I"m sorry l"m late, Aunt Ellen, but the herbs were scarce and hard to find. "Tis a poor excuse, Barbara. You must have been daydreaming again. Of a certain tall, well-favored man, I warrant. ELLEN: Why, what do you mean? That was Tituba"s prophecy for her. A dark, handsome young man. SUSY: A dark young man? Well, it certainly couldn"t be Miles. Well, Martha... What kept you so long, John? I had to stop by Goody Dobbs. I didn"t know she was ailing. (LAUGHlNG) She isn"t, but her cow is. Is that where you found Barbara? Oh, no, no, she was hurrying along the... (STAMMERS) In the forest. MAN: Ready for the door, John. Coming! Coming! Mr. Parris, my little contribution. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. It"s all right. Look, it will be finished by sundown. Splendid. Even to the shelves for your books. Ooh. That reminds me. You promised to lend me Cotton Mather"s book on witchcraft. Did you bring it? No. I can"t lay my hands on it. I"ve searched the house. It"s disappeared. ""Sometimes they would be deaf, ""sometimes dumb and sometimes blind, ""then their tongues would be drawn down their throats, ""then they would be pulled out on their chins to a prodigious length. ""They would make the most piteous outcries. ""They were scratched, they were pinched and tormented, ""all of which they said was the work of women who bewitched them. ""Sometimes the children were shaken with a fit."" I don"t want to be pinched and tormented. Quiet! I"m only telling you what"s in a book. It must have been dreadful. Did those children die? No. They were the talk of the colony. Cotton Mather even took one of them to live in his great house in Boston. The whole town came to see her and prayed over her. The whole town? Oh, my. Yes. Just like they pray over a queen or somebody great. I"d like that. So would l. I don"t want anybody to bewitch me. Will you keep still? What else did they do? Go on, read some more. All right. (BELL TOLLlNG) Dinner! Don"t you tell! No. Wait for me! Wait for me! (MERCY SOBBlNG) Ann, go back there and help Mercy. Oh, let her help herself! I"m not her mother! Ann! There, there. Oh, Mercy! Mercy, don"t cry. Barbara"s here. Yes. There, there. Ann is such a naughty girl, but we don"t care. No. Now, what shall we do? Shall we make a puppet? Yes, please, Barbara. Yes, that"s what we"ll do. Now, watch. And we"ll make it to look just like Barbara, shall we? Look. Now, we"ll take a piece of string... Mary, have you seen Mercy? I think she"s in the saw pit, Mrs. Cheeves. Susy, will you tend to this for me? I"ll be back in a minute. (LAUGHlNG) I think she"s very funny. She looks just like me, doesn"t she? What are you doing? Come here. (SOBBlNG) And stop that crying or l"ll give you a good whipping. Drop that, child. Children wait till their elders are served. I don"t have to wait. What"s this? Why, this is what the master was looking for. Give it back this minute. No, no, not to you. Master Goode, sir. She took it. No, no, master. It fell from her bonnet. She... Go to the house. I"ll attend to you later. But, Father... At once! I haven"t had a drink all day. Bilge. It is all right, Marshal, I know me way to the stocks. And see that you go straight. (GRUNTS) As straight as me legs"ll carry me. (SPANKlNG) ANN: No, Father. No! (ANN SOBBlNG) GOODE: Now, get into your bed and stay there. (ANN CONTlNUES SOBBlNG) Don"t, Ann. Don"t cry. I hate him! I hate him. I hate Tituba! Oh, I could kill her for telling him! Don"t, Ann, don"t! You look like you"re bewitched! Do l? Did I really frighten you? Yes. You look awful. Mistress, the master... He doesn"t know. Is that the potion you were telling me about? Yes, the juice of herbs and flowers, Iike I used to make in my country. Will it take you to the witches" feast? Can you truly go there? My spirit can. Could I go there if I drank your potion? No, no, mistress. It wouldn"t be right for you. Why not? Your husband, Master Goode. He won"t know. Tituba, you must help me. I can"t go on like this. I want the things you promised me. Laughter, dancing, happiness. You promised me happiness would come to me. I want it now. I want to live before the years close in. I"m afraid! I"m afraid, mistress. No, l"m afraid. Tituba, I may not have need for this old cloak. It would keep you warm this winter. Well, will you give it to me now? Will you? Yes, I will. Yes, I will. Yes. You will drink this at an open window in the dark of the moon. Elder. Why, Mr. Morse. What brings you so far afield? Is anything amiss? I come from Cape Ann with evil tidings. Come in. Come in. GOODE: Of course you"ll stay the night. MORSE: Thank you, I will. Good evening, mistress. Good evening. Abigail, Mr. Morse is staying the night. Prepare a bed for him. Yes, Nathaniel. Sit ye down and rest. Rest? I cannot rest. Neither will anyone else in this village when they hear what I have to say. Deborah. Martha, something"s amiss. Yes. (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) My good people, Mr. Morse has ridden from Cape Ann with grave tidings for us all. Hear him. People of Salem Village, we are in great danger. The power of evil is upon us. Strange apparitions have been seen in the forests. The people of Cape Ann have barricaded themselves in their homes. The Elders have seized women who have confessed to being witches. (ALL GASPlNG) Others have been taken at Boston. The evil is spreading among us. Beware of those in secret league with Satan. Satan, who is fighting to destroy our faith in God. We know how he works with such men and women who have given their souls to him, sending his spirit into them with power to harm and destroy others. Power to bring sickness and blight upon us. Children have been bewitched, their minds tormented, their bodies twisted. No one is safe. So watch your neighbor. Watch one another, even those of your own household. For those we least suspect may be the devil"s servants wearing the false cloak of godliness. (WlND BLOWlNG) The scriptures say, ""Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. ""And if any man or woman consulteth with a familiar spirit, (RAlN PATTERlNG) ""they shall be put to death!"" So, death to them, or we ourselves will be destroyed. Death to the servants of darkness. (THUNDER RUMBLlNG) (WlND HOWLlNG) (SOBBlNG) Barbara! It"s monstrous, coming here and spreading terror through the whole village. I tell you, it"s monstrous. But there must be reason to fear. But to threaten death, to burn and to hang. I"ve never believed in witchcraft. There"s been no real proof of it. (BANGlNG ON DOOR) MR. CHEEVES: Dr. John! Come. Come quickly. Little Ann Goode is afflicted. What ails the child? We don"t know, but she"s in great torment. I"ll come with you, John, I may be able to help. Yes. Hurry. (SOBBlNG) They"re hurting me. They"re hurting me again. Ann. Ann, who hurt you? Thank heaven you"ve come, Doctor. Ann. Ann. Ann. Oh, they"re choking me. Oh, they"re torturing me. Ann! Ann, child, quiet. I can"t! This is Dr. John. Tell me, what hurts you? Everything. Everything. (GROANlNG) Ann. Ann. I see them by Nabby. They"re after her, too. Abigail. Abigail? Yes, where is her mother? I"ll get her. (SCREAMlNG) Ann, my child. Abigail. Abigail... Abigail. No. No. They"re drinking wine, red as blood. (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) MAN: How can they stand it? WOMAN: Poor little things. Who could be doing this? If we only knew, we"d make short work of them. Poor little souls. They"ve been suffering all night. (ANN SCREAMlNG) Has anyone found out what"s hurting them? No. Mr. Morse is still questioning them. (NABBY GROANlNG) (GROANlNG) Quiet, dear, quiet. (SOBBlNG) I can find nothing physically wrong with them. Because they"re beyond your skill, Doctor. I know the signs of bewitchment. Bewitchment. We want to help you, others may be harmed. If someone is hurting you, we must know who it is. It"s clearer. Clearer. I see. Don"t. Don"t. Don"t let her hurt me. Don"t... I do see! I do see! Don"t let her hurt me! Don"t let her hurt me. You mean Tituba? Yes. Don"t let her get away. Catch her. Tell the others. Quick. It"s Tituba. ALL: Tituba? Aye. They"ve cried out against Tituba! (ALL CLAMORlNG) Get back there. They"ll see you. Will... Will they hurt her much? No. She"s only a slave. I... I"m afraid! Well, you don"t have to be. Now, get back there quick, and lie down. (OVERLAPPlNG CHATTER) And then they took the poor creature to Salem Town for a hearing. But how can they believe that people become devils all of a sudden? There"s no reason to it. There never is any reason when fear strikes. Roger, if that slave confesses, which she may do under their form of questioning, madness will sweep the whole village. It"s hard to explain, lad, but l"ve seen it happen in England. Then no one is safe? No one. Even to defend a person accused arouses suspicion. That"s why I fear for Barbara. Barbara? Today she tried to protect Tituba. I warned her, but... What are you going to do? Do? What would you have me do, after what you"ve told me? I must get her away from here. But think of yourself, you mustn"t be seen. It will do you no good to lie. Now tell us, why did you bewitch those children? I didn"t. I didn"t. We"ve been patient long enough. Confess. But I don"t know nothing about it. You said you did. You said you knew Satan, that you saw him. But, master, I just made up tales to please them. I meant no harm. This woman is a witch. I"ve proof of it. She bewitched my wife. SEWALL: Your wife? You"re the first to know. My wife told me that last night this woman forced her to take a magical potion. But she made me give it to her. GOODE: You lie. My wife spoke while she was under bewitchment. You took her there. I didn"t. I didn"t. Did you give her the potion? You must answer. Yes, master. But it was only the juice of the flowers to make her sleep. Confess your witchcraft. But, master, you"ll hang me. No, no. Not if you confess. That will prove your repentance and save your life. You mean, if I say l"m a witch, that"s repentance? SEWALL: Yes. And you won"t put a rope around my neck? You won"t hang me? LAUGHTON: No, no, you"ll live. MORSE: Confess! I confess. Yes. Yes, I confess. You"re in league with the devil. Yes, yes. You"ve seen him. Yes, often, often. It was you who hurt the children? Yes. I hurt the children. But I didn"t mean to hurt them. They made me. The others made me. They hurt the... Others? TlTUBA: Yes. There was many others. Do you know who they are? Yes. Now, let me go. Let me go. MORSE: Tell us their names. Oh, let me go. MORSE: Tell us their names! It was Goody Hodgers and... Giles Cory, Charles Patton and... (BELL TOLLlNG) Halt! What is this? Tituba has confessed. And has cried out against others. Who are named? Giles Cory, Goody Hodgers, and many others. John. John. Giles Cory. Are they mad? We cannot let this go on. There"s nothing we can do. There must be. If you won"t, l... Barbara. Come to the house. Why? Come into the house. Well, what is this? Barbara, you must not speak nor defend anyone accused. But why? Believe me, dear, it"s dangerous. Ellen is right. Why do you both look at me so strangely? Because we fear for you. Fear for me? Ellen, tell her. Barbara, you"ve never known about your mother, how she died. Why, yes. She died in England of grief, when my father was lost at sea. Not of grief. A woman hated her. She whispered that your mother, by witchcraft, had caused your father"s death. She was accused of witchcraft? JOHN: Convicted and... ELLEN: We had to tell you, dear, because of the danger. If this were known, suspicion might point to you. You see, Barbara, why you must keep silent? Do... Do others know? Only Martha. Martha? You know we came from the same town in England. But I have her promise not to tell. (SOBBlNG) God have pity. God have pity. What a heavy secret for you to carry all this while. Now, go up to bed, please. You need rest. You will be careful? Yes. I wish we could have kept this from you. No. John, they want you at the meeting house. Oh, yes. I"ll come at once. Good night, Barbara. TlMOTHY: Barbara. Why aren"t you asleep? What were all those people doing outside? Never mind. Now, go to sleep. I know. It"s because of Satan. I heard Mrs. Cheeves say so. (SlGHlNG) That"s just her way of making you be a good boy. Oh, then I can go out tomorrow and play? No, no. The Elders want all children to stay in for a few days. But I want to go out. Oh, Timothy, please go to sleep. (SOBBlNG) (WlNDOW PANE TlNKLlNG) (GASPS) Why, you"re trembling. Oh, hold me close. There, there. I know what has happened. Jeremiah has told me. That"s why l"ve come here. I have a plan to take you away. Away? Of course. I could not let you stay here now. But... But, Roger, to leave here, and leave Aunt Ellen. You love me, don"t you? Oh, Roger. Then you must trust me. But where could we go? There are many countries not under British rule. I"m going to Boston to find a ship that will give us passage. Jeremiah goes with me. When all is arranged, he"ll come and bring you to me. No, l"m afraid. Afraid? With me? Oh, no, for you. You may be seen. If you were taken, I might never see you again. I"ll be a very shadow for your sake. I"ll travel only by night. Now, think of this while l"m gone, that soon we"ll be together, without hiding, without secrecy. You"ll be my wife. Oh, my dearest. (JEREMlAH WHlSTLlNG) That"s Jeremiah. Someone must be on the road. I must go now. Goodbye. Oh, no, Roger. Roger. Oh. Oh, Timothy. What are you doing out of bed? Who were you with? What? I saw you. You were with a man. Oh, nonsense, you must have been dreaming or perhaps you saw the shadow of a tree. No, it wasn"t a tree. Now, may I go out and play tomorrow? No. Very well, then. I"ll tell Mother and Elder Goode you were with a man. Timothy. Timothy. I tell you I was with no man. Mother! You mustn"t do that. Why are you so frightened? Look, Timmy. I was with someone, but if it were known it would make trouble. You wouldn"t want to make trouble for me, would you? No. Well, then, will you promise me you won"t tell anyone? Can I go out and play tomorrow? If you promise. I"d best go in alone. Bide here, lad. A tankard of ale, if you please. Aye, aye, sir. The harbor seems well filled. Aye, shipping be good. Sea trade brisk. Boston port be growing. What craft are in? Well, let"s see, there"s the Pirateer, the Charles Hope, the Seraphim... The Seraphim? From Virginia? Aye. I know her well. Who"s her skipper? Captain Edwards. He was here but a moment ago. Edwards? I must give him a hail. Where"s the Seraphim lying? At the foot of Fort Street. Sailing at flood tide. Thank ye. FlRST MATE: Ho, there. What do you want? Is the captain aboard? CAPTAlN: Aye. But all hands signed, if that"s what you"re asking. Well, not exactly, Captain Edwards. This is somewhat of a personal nature. Why, Mr. Coverman, I didn"t recognize you in this... Oh. Come below, come below. Come in. Sat thee down, sat thee down. Thank ye. I see you have a new mate. Aye, a lusty lad. I never thought to see you again, sir. I"ve been with my uncle here. Jeremiah Adams, Captain Edwards. And I wanted to thank you, Captain, for what you did for Roger. I might not have shipped the lad so safely had I known the price on his head. That was your loss, Captain. Little did you think I was worth the price of a new ship to you. That I didn"t, that I didn"t. But l"m satisfied to find you a free man. Aye, but would I be in Virginia? No, lad. Although there"s rumor of a new governor coming from England. A new governor? Aye. But they"re still hanging every rebel they catch. I feared as much. That"s why we sought you out. Captain, "tis urgent that I get away from here to some foreign port. Foreign port, eh? As to that, the French are none too friendly. But there"s Florida. That"s under Spanish rule. Are there Spanish ships in port? There must be. I heard a parrot swearing in Spanish at the tavern. It"ll take no time to find out. Then let"s lose none. Aye, but you"re forgetting the rum. I give you Their Majesties. Their Majesties. Their Majesties. Watch your head when you come up. Watch your head. There. Steady there. What"s afoot? Sir, that man"s a rebel. He"s wanted for treason in Virginia, and we demand his arrest. You demand. Yeah. Aboard my ship? Yeah. Go forward. Seize him, men. Well, as for you, sir. FlRST MATE: Steady, lads, take him alive. Save yourself, Uncle! Get back to Barbara! FlRST MATE: Seize him. You devils. "Tis likely we"ve saved you trouble, sir. Go mighty hard with ye, harboring a rebel against the Crown. Bring him forward. 1,000 worth of cargo. And the reward will be divided among us all. SAlLOR: Well, this one"s done for. Come on. Over the side with him. We"ll be at sea when he wakes up. (MOB SHOUTlNG) (lNDlSTlNCT) Let it be understood that this is but a hearing, not a trial. I call Ezra Cheeves. Now tell us, how did the prisoner harm you? In many ways, sir. I mind well the evening, two weeks ago, she came down through her meadow and stood at the fence, looking at my cattle. In the morning, my cows had gone dry. (PEOPLE MURMURlNG) Then you believe she bewitched them? Aye, sir. And myself, too. For that night, I did have grievous pains in my left side, so grievous, I could not sleep. What have you to say to all this? I have not harmed him nor his cattle. I have not left my house for the past fortnight. I have been ill. Then it was her apparition I saw. I saw your witch"s face. You cast a spell on me. It"s true. She cast a spell on me. She told me at the house-raising that I would never be happy, that evil would come to me. And it did. My children were stricken. I was made ill. How could she foretell what would happen to me if she isn"t a witch? (SOBBlNG) (GAVEL POUNDlNG) But... But what I said was counsel, meant only for her good. MORSE: Enough. Was it like this when my mother was... (SHUSHlNG) Child. On the evidence presented against Goodwife Nurse, we order her removed to Their Majesties" jail at Salem, there to await trial for witchcraft. No. No. How can you do such a thing to this saintly woman? I"ve known her from my childhood. She has done naught but good all her life. MORSE: Silence. You all know I speak the truth. There"s not one of you but has had some token of her kindness. What right have you to speak? This wench has no place here. I have as much as you, Mr. Cheeves. I beg you, sirs, do not send Rebecca Nurse to her death on the testimony of a man who tried to steal her land and did not succeed. He says his cows went dry. Who knows but it was time for them to go dry? He says he has pains in his side. Is it so strange for an old man who loves his cider to have pains? And you call this witchcraft. MORSE: You defy this court? But this is a matter of life and death. You hear only the accusers. Why not examine them? Find out if they"re lying, or if their minds are deranged. Only a witch defends a witch, and I know her for one. Ask Timothy Clarke what he told my daughter. Ask him. (ANN SOBBlNG) MORSE: Bring the lad forward. What did you tell? I didn"t tell anything. He did. Speak up, lad. I only told Ann that one night I looked from my window and saw Barbara go out to the bridge and meet... Timothy. You promised. MORSE: Go on. And meet someone in the shadows, tall and black. He... He put his arms around her. MORSE: You mean it was a man? It looked like a man, but when I asked Barbara, she said it wasn"t. She said she was with someone, but she was with no man. MORSE: She said she was with no man? TlMOTHY: Yes. And... And she made me promise not to tell what I saw. Witch. Witch. Oh, no. I can explain. I was with... (WOMAN SCREAMlNG) MORSE: Satan. Guard. Guard. Well, sir? Where are my friends? Why haven"t they come to see me? Governor"s orders, sir. Prisoners condemned for treason can see no one. But can"t I see my friend Mr. Denham? I have a message I must send north to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. I"m sorry, sir. There"s nothing I can do. (PEOPLE SHOUTlNG) (DOGS BARKlNG) Hold. What"s beyond? Black swamp for miles. There"s no use going on. The dogs could not trail, sir. Could Mr. Coverman get through, do you think? SOLDlER: No man could live in there. Ironical, isn"t it, Denham, that this should happen on the day that the new governor arrived with his pardon? (PEOPLE SHOUTlNG) (DOOR UNLOCKlNG) Oh... Oh, John. John. I cannot believe it"s really you. It"s been so long since l"ve seen anyone. I know. I know. I tried every way. They wouldn"t let me come here until today. But why? Barbara Clarke, you are ordered to appear before the court. (BELL TOLLlNG) (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) MAN: Here come the judges. SOLDlER: Halt. Forward face. Barbara Clarke, you are hereby indicted and arraigned on charges of practicing the detestable arts of witchcraft, to the grievous harm and the endangerment of the colony. You have persistently denied these charges. Now, if you expect mercy of God, confess. I have nothing to confess. LAUGHTON: Then you deny that you have been snared into witchcraft? I deny there is such a thing as witchcraft. (PEOPLE GASPlNG) Blasphemy. Why waste time trying her? I am sworn to administer justice, Mr. Morse. The trial will proceed. Timothy Clarke. Come forward. Timothy, you have stated that on a certain night you saw the accused in the arms of a cloaked figure? Yes, sir. And when she said it was no man, you believed it was Satan himself? Answer. Yes, sir. But the child did not say that at the hearing. No, sir. The thought has since been put into his mind. Silence. Under the law, you may not speak without leave. LAUGHTON: You have said that you saw her in her room at night, dancing alone. Yes, sir. LAUGHTON: And when you questioned her, she said? She... She said she was dancing with a handsome young man. But... But I wasn"t supposed to see him. And have you anything to say to that? I was but jesting, pretending. No more. LAUGHTON: And who were you pretending to dance with? The man Timothy saw at the bridge. The man I have already told you of. The man you all refuse to believe exists. May I question Timothy? You may question. Timothy, that night, you really thought it was a man, didn"t you? TlMOTHY: Yes. Well, it was. Now think. Try hard to remember. That man wore a feather in his hat, a dark cloak, a long sword. Strange clothes that you had never seen before. Couldn"t that have made you think that he was not real? Yes. LAUGHTON: Enough. Timothy, you may go. Barbara Clarke, you"ve told a strange story. If there were such a man as you now claim, why didn"t you tell about him in the beginning? Because I believed Timothy had seen his face and could describe him. SEWALL: Why shouldn"t he describe him? Because he was in hiding here, a political refugee. LAUGHTON: An artful tale. SEWALL: Is he in hiding still? He must be, or he would come to me now. Is he known to anyone here? What is his name? Can you tell us anything about him? (SOBBlNG) I cannot. I cannot betray him. Do we need any further evidence? I think we do. So far, it has not been proven that the accused has brought harm to anyone as charged. But she has. She"s brought harm to one Mercy Cheeves. Call Mercy Cheeves. Mercy Cheeves. Now tell us, how did the prisoner harm your child? She has bewitched her, sirs. She gave her a puppet. From that day she has been ailing until we fear for her life. LAUGHTON: Is that the puppet? Yes. LAUGHTON: Let me see it. (SOBBlNG) Don"t. Please don"t take it. (SHUSHlNG) She cries this way whenever it is taken from her. Child, who has bewitched you? (MERCY SOBBlNG) Barbara. Barbara. Don"t let them hurt me. Let me go. Let me go. Let the child go to the prisoner. There, there, Mercy, don"t cry. No one is going to hurt you. Barbara won"t let them. Why don"t you come home with me? I will, dear, soon. No. Come now. What"s these? That... That"s just a silly game we"re playing. They took my puppet. I know, but her dress was all dirty. Now, if you leave her here, I"ll make her a nice new one. A red one? Yes. Yes, a red one. Now, be a good girl and go to your mother, will you? Go, Mercy. (SOBBlNG) Take the child out. ALL: She"s a witch. She"s a witch. GOODE: Of course she"s a witch. You have condemned yourself. Now tell us, what power have you over that child? Can you not see for yourselves? It"s something that poor child has never had from its father and mother, kindness and love. Things that seem to have been forgotten hereabouts. Is it so strange that she should turn to someone who shows her a little kindness, and yet the evidence of such you call evil? Don"t, don"t let this blindness lead us again to murder! There"s been enough of it. Isn"t it plain that she"s telling the truth? That she"s shielding someone, someone she cares for? I know because... John. No, no, John. Please do not listen to him. She"s bewitched him, too. Martha! She"s of evil blood, born into witchcraft. Don"t, Martha! Don"t! Her mother was burned as a witch in England. (PEOPLE SHOUTlNG) (GAVEL POUNDlNG) What proof have you of this? Ask her own aunt, Ellen Clarke. LAUGHTON: Call Ellen Clarke. You have heard the accusation. Is it true? Answer. Was the prisoner"s mother burned as a witch? Yes. But many innocent people were called witches. Was she pronounced a witch by a God-fearing English court? Answer. Oh, stop it. Stop it. Isn"t it enough that you"re torturing me? Yes, my mother was accused of being a witch. She was burned as one. But does that prove she was guilty any more than I am, or the others you have condemned? We"re not tried by justice, but by fear and ignorance. MORSE: "Tis the devil speaking. There is no power of evil such as you believe. Blasphemy. Why don"t you confess? I will not confess a lie, nor deny God to save my life. I do confess pity for you. You who have been given the power to save and send righteous people to their death. I don"t ask mercy of you, but only pray God for your awakening. She"s innocent. (ALL SHOUTlNG) Oh, good day, lad. You"re Timothy, I warrant. Will you tell your cousin Barbara l"m here? Barbara? She... She... What is it, lad? Speak up. Mother. Barbara, will you not confess and save your life? Then may He have mercy on your soul. ROGER: Hold. MAN: Who is he? Hold. Hold. Hold. "Tis murder you"re doing. By what authority do you interfere? Arrest him! Take him away. Wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold. At least let us hear what he has to say. Who are you, sir? I am Roger Coverman. I"m the one that girl"s been protecting. The one you poor fools thought was Satan. Well, look at me. Am I not flesh and blood? Aye. Now that I look well, "twas you. "Twas you that made me think I saw the devil himself. Now are you convinced? But what of the other charges against her? Have you not heard enough? Will you be satisfied only with this girl"s death, when before your very eyes the principal charge against her has been proven false? What of the others who were hanged here? What if they were innocent, too? ROGER: Barbara. Barbara. Ann, come here. Father. Please. Please, Father. Please. Please forgive me, Father. Forgive me. (SOBBlNG) I"m sorry. Oh, merciful God, forgive. The child confessed that it was spite that made her accuse the slave Tituba. You see, she didn"t realize what great harm might come from it. We... We made a thorough investigation. We now believe that all the other accusations sprang from either fear or malice. Now, as one of Their Majesties" judges, I beg Your Excellency to sign. Although this abolishes trial for witchcraft in this colony, it in no way atones for the past. We must do everything in our power to safeguard the future. First, it is my order that the tree on Gallows Hill be destroyed.
