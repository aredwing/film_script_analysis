Maybe I can come get that at seven? Sure. Great! See you later then. You do not know who I am? - Yes, Mr. Taranto. But the boss told me... that if your name is not listed, You can not enter. I'm sorry but your name not here. Candy! Hello .. good to see you! You look great. Hello, Jennifer. I like your shoes! See? I am with them. Maybe you guys can help me with a small problem. Maybe. Must be a mistake, but someone forgot to put my name on the list. It's a shame. We'll go and I'll try to get something for you. That was cool! I'll wait here for you guys. While going to the toilet puts you at ease. I fuck like a beast. I even wrote a song about it. Come on, tell. I spend my tongue during Really? Good. - Hey, Candy! Candy... Sorry.
