I got drunk once- One or two drinks at lunch. But since I've been here I have been really good. I have been on time- all my meetings- everything. - Ask Mitch. - Um, yeah. That's not what Doreen told me. Doreen? Oh. I hate Doreen. And the way you talk to her- you know what? I'm sorry, but this is going to end right here. Frank.

Julia, I'm warning you- if you do not stick to our arrangement... - What? - ... and go to the meetings... - What happens? - lose my number. Woman: I gave birth. I was drunk out of my head. I didn't know where I was or with whom. I know I wasn't in a hospital or a police station or even a bedroom. I just- whomp- emptied out my guts, got rid of her. I didn't take care of her to such an extent that when I saw her start drinking, I watched her pick up the bottle and I didn't do a thing. I saw it as inevitable. I gave her her first drink. I think I- no, I know I wanted her to suffer as much as I had, and even more. Hi. We have a new schedule. There's gonna be some construction work and we're gonna do some changes. Can I offer you some coffee? No. - Hi, Elena. - Hi, Henry. It's the new schedule. There's gonna be some changes because of the construction around here. Great. I love the color.

And we can help you. I know you. You live right across from me. We're neighbors. Well, I'm not really down with the good-neighbor shit. Oh. I live alone also. Well, not really alone. I have a boy- Tom. He's eight years old. Now he's living with his grandfather. How do you know I live alone? Oh, because I see you in the kitchen- your kitchen, yeah, through the window. - Oh. - That's right. - Group: Lord grant me the serenity... - Bye. ...to accept the things I can't change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

Uh-huh, yeah, You've got quite the bird's-eye view of my fairy palace from here, don't you, huh? This happens to me sometimes. That's why it's good for you to go to the meetings. Yeah. The meetings. Those prayers and women lamenting and- it kind of creeps me out. I find it obscene. Somebody forces me to go to those meetings, you know. It's not my decision. My boy- That man- He forbids me seeing him. But it's not my decision either. He tells the boy terrible things. He tells him I'm evil and that I'm sick here. He lives like a prisoner in this man's house with dogs and bodyguards. It's been five years now. But I'm gonna see Tom again soon. Yeah. There's a man who's in charge who watches him. And-and if I give him money, he will let me see Tom. I'm gonna kidnap Tom. What? I'm just giving a child his mother back. He deserves to know where half his heart comes from, right? And-and, I mean, that way we can get away from his filth. - Really? - I need your help. Please, I'm begging you. I need your help. I can't do this alone. I'll pay you. I'll pay you. To-to kidnap your kid? - Yes. - You're fucking nuts. If he calls and says yes, he's gonna take Tom to a river where they go and bathe. I know this place. Nobody goes there. And, you know, all you have to do is stay in your car a- and-and wait there. My car stays right where it is, lady. There are license plates on cars. You're right. And I can rent one in my name. And for doing this I will give you $50,000. $50,000? That's a lot of money. I know, yeah, but I have all this money. - I have it in Mexico. - In Mexico. And I also have stocks from my husband. I have a lot of money and I don't want any of that. I just need Tom. I just want Tom. No, don't go. Please, don't go. - Just wait. - Okay okay okay. I need to show you what I'm saving him from. - Okay. - Don't leave. What the fuck? You know, my child- He can never be happy with this man. He is going to destroy my kid. I gotta go. I don't know the first thing about kids. Great story. Oh, fuck. Hello. Man: Hey, Honey Honey, we're closed. Hey, you're- I'm here. You're open. We've been closed for about half an hour now. Could I just get a vodka tonic? A vodka tonic? Can I just get-? I'm waiting for something. - Yeah? - Yeah, sure. Vodka tonic? Please. Nice place you've got here. Well... You don't mind if I smoke, do you? No. You don't want me smoking in the street outside- - Not a good look. - Honey, you just sit here and smoke. You're a kind man. Mm-hmm. You're a kind man. Going somewhere? - Mitch! - Seen my pants? 'Cause I can't find them anywhere. I'll make some coffee. You know, what you did do was you collapsed. Yeah yeah. I picked you up. I had to carry you to my car. I put you inside. I opened a window. You know what you said? "fuck you. " No, what you said- Oh, God, you said- You went like this and then you said, "the wind caresses my face like no man ever will. " - Fucking poet. - God, you were so beautiful. I kissed you. Well, you know I have this unbelievable power over men. Yeah. You did a bad thing. You did a bad thing. How would you know anything happened between us? And why would you even give a shit? Aren't you the one who likes to wake up in the morning not remembering what happened? I am finding this whole experience very revealing. The real Mitch- no saint after all, Honey. I mean, these photographs of the little family- the lovely wife and the adorable children everywhere. I didn't sleep with you. You slept with me. You were here alone. Bullshit. You were asleep there in a coma on the Couch. I'm in there asleep. I woke up in your bed with my dress half off. I wake up, you're suddenly crying your little eyes out. - I was crying? - Yeah, like a little baby. I had to put my arms around you- a big giraffe like you. "I don't want to sleep alone. " - Oh, really? - Yeah yeah. And you know what, Julia? Any guy would do. You stink of loneliness, Buster. You're not my type. Do you think you could shut up for a minute? Is that possible? 'Cause I'd like to tell you something here. If you're not careful, you could lose it all in one night- in one bad night. I'll tell you about the old Mitch, okay? - Oh, come on. - If you shut up. The old Mitch, who was a real fucking drinker, could drink you under the table any fucking day of the week, believe me. A disaster for my family, but I didn't give a fuck. And one bad night One of my kids gets in the way. And I just- I just wanted to push her, but that's not what I did. What I did is I hit her. All this rag came out of me. I wanted to do some real fucking damage. My fist came down on her. She just went- What is she, eight years old? Skinny little arms- she went flying against that wall. She dropped right there, not breathing. My wife goes running over to her, picks her up, takes her to the hospital. Saved her life- my little Lucy. You know what I did? I went in there and I went to sleep. Passed out. Just another night. 13 years- haven't seen them since. Julia, do not waste a second thinking that you've got these magical incredible powers, because what you are is an out-of-control suicidal blind alcoholic. But I'm here. I'm here to help you. Are you in love with me, Mitch? - Is this what this is? - Oh, God. You know, it's not a good idea. I'm a disaster to be in love with. You know that. You know, I just fuck you up and then you hate me and then- and then I lose my friend. So the ring that I got in my pocket here- I shouldn't bring it out 'cause you're gonna say no? Listen, kiddo, if I'm in love with you, none of your fucking business, okay? That's too bad 'cause you got great legs. It's right here. Here? The river is down there. You want me to walk down there? - Yeah, yes, come. - Well, I'm not- It's fine. I'll help you. - Okay. - Okay. This is where they're gonna park their car, right here. And this is where they have their picnic, Over here. And we're here with Tom. Okay, I'm gonna bring him and tell him I need to speak to him alone- you know, this intimacy thing. And we're gonna be around this area. And there's nowhere to run, see? So he's not gonna think anything. And the car's gonna be over there. So, okay, and here's when I'm taking the gun. I'm shooting in his direction- poom poom. Whoa whoa whoa. That is the first time I've heard you bring up a gun. 'Cause I'm not, you know- well, it's only to frighten him Because I need to take his car keys and the cell phone. It's only that. It's only that. Don't worry. So in the moment that he needs to reach someone, we're gonna be really far away. So, okay, that is gonna be your sign to come here- to come and pick us up right here. Eh? See? - You know, Elena, I have to ask this- - Yeah. Um... What if Tom doesn't wanna? - Doesn't want what? - Doesn't wanna go. I mean, doesn't recognize you. Oh, no, he will recognize me. He will? Yeah yeah. Okay, so say- say- let's say that it all goes good And you've got your kid back. Then what? Well, then you drive us back to San Diego, you know? Because we're going home. We're going to Mexico. I have everything there ready for him. You know, that asshole wanted to leave me without everything Brian gave me. And I fought him. I fought him and I won the trial. So now I'm rich, Julia. I have more money than I need. Yeah. I don't know. # I can't get you out of my mind # # true love # # is so hard to find... # Hello. Elena, it's me- Julia. I'll do it. I knew it. I knew it. God told me. Thank you so much. No no, I mean, the guy is a prick, right? And he's got your kid. And, you know, there's no mother in the world that wouldn't do what you're doing. So you can rest assured I'm with you. Hey, does Nick Costello still live here? Nick- Nick Costello. - Yes, he sleep. - He's here? - Yes. - Can I-? Old friend. - Yes. - Nick- very old- He's not sleeping. There he is. He's lounging is what he's doing.

You got a wife? - Yeah. - Man! Now, Nicky, you think she might like to go out to the store and get a few beers or something, you know, get lost for a while? I have something I want to ask you. No funny business. I just have to ask you something. ...and the woman is a total nutjob. She doesn't give a shit about me. All she does all the time non-stop is talk about the kid, the kid, the kid, the kid. And I'm supposed to take the risk of going away for what? A measly 20 grand? And for what? Why would I do that for her? And there's real money there, Nick. I tell you, I've seen the pictures and they're loaded. But you know, the money is not enough for her. No no, she has to have the kid. - She's the mother, for Christ's sakes. - Well, exactly. That's what I'm saying. She's the mother. And of course, the lady- you know, she has to have her kid. Right, okay. Well, then she has to pay for it. And it's time my luck changed. And it's time something went right for me for a change, and you. Yeah, how's that gonna happen? It's simple. Okay, listen here. I go with her. I get the kid. Sweet, okay. And then here's the kicker- We kidnap the kid from her. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - We kidnap the kid from her. Listen to me. We're coming back in the car. I think of something. You know me- I'll think of something. And I stop the car and you're there, right? You're there and you separate them and you take the kid and you take off with the kid. You just take off with the kid, okay? And don't worry about the woman 'cause I'll deal with her. And then- and then what happens? And then, you know, she has no choice. I mean, what is she gonna do? She's either gotta come up with the money- whatever we ask- or the child goes back to the old man, she never sees him again. I mean, she's got to pay, right? And plus, it's not even like she can go to the cops. It's the double-cross of a lifetime. And the money- it's right there. It's right there. I can smell it. And-and they can go anywhere they want. They can go to Mexico. They can go to bueno bye-bye. And we can go where the fuck we like. Julia, where did you get this idea? Nick, you know my life. You know my life. You know it.

Go ahead. What are you gonna do now, huh? You're not getting the money unless I get the kid. You gotta trust me, Julia. Look at me, why do you think I'm here? It's because of you. You're here for one reason. For only one reason, Mitch, and that is that your wife didn't turn you in. Oh yeah. You got lucky, man. I don't have that luck. Look at me. You know I didn't turn you in. - Do I? - Julia, We all knew that Elena's stupid insane story about getting her kid back was bullshit. We heard it over and over again at meetings. Why is it that you are the only one who believed her? Why? You're dangerous to this kid, Julia, because you're a danger to yourself. You see that? No. You don't have the guts to see it. You're blind. I'm going. Go. Julia? We're at the airport hotel. We're waiting for the kid. Ohhh... - You got the money? - Shut your hole. Yeah, I got the money. Not here.

Okay, I'm taking you to your mother. # okay, what do we got here? # # a horny black boy and a frisky white girl # # eye each other across the room # # and the chemistry is unbearable # # and definitely not on anyone's agenda # # he suggests they go someplace they won't be seen # # and she thinks otherwise, finally they agree to go # # and put up with dunkin' donuts # # the usual story # # they fall in love under a hail of spit # # that they ignore while secretly conspiring to murder each other # # hoping that will alleviate the slightly more uncomfortable # # feelings that may arise in a situation like this # # but behind closed doors, the eyes of the world # # becoming their wallpaper # # they melt into a beautiful example of a power # # that definitely exists # # and come together on a warm moonlit night... #
