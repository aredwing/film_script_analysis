Praise the Lord. it's almost time for Jesus to rise up. As preacher. I expect the flock to be in the church tomorrow on Easter morning. As tribal chairman. I invite you to party the night away at Rave-N Fest. He found himself in mystic places. Tonight. as we celebrate the birth of the crow. and the coming of our Raven Aztec Casino. Hallelujah. hallelujah! Praise Jesus! And don't forget to eat your 1 2 lucky grapes for dinner. One for each month of the coming year. This Spanish custom worked wonders for our conquistador conquerors. and it'll work wonders for you. 'Cause the name of our lucky tribe is the Raven Aztecs. Barnaby. there comes a time in every man's life when he's just got to face the fact that the contents of his fridge just ain't cutting it. And now. I want to introduce our shaman and my daughter. Lily Ignites The Dawn. In times like these. when our community is divided. and we hear calls for vengeance. it's important to remember the old stories. Killer! Murderer! We are told that when someone dies... Convict! ...the crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. - Then sometimes. just sometimes... - You hear me? I called you convict. -...the crow can bring that soul back... - Shit. here he comes. ...to release it of its burden. To put the wrong things right. What gives the crow his strength? Not hatred. or bitterness. or anger. His strength is love. - Come on. baby. Rave-N Fest? No. No. Never again. Come on. I want them to see you through my eyes. Lily. I'm off parole at midnight. We can hit the coast before anybody notices. I want them to notice. I do. I love you. Jimmy! You put too much faith in people. I believe in a lot of things. Even you. Jimmy Cuervo. I am what I am. If you want to escape from here. you gotta let it go. You gotta let it all go. I can't. Not without you. Now. that kind of belief will get you locked up. Set me free. Warden. You know what time I get off. Don't be late. Lily. "m gonna let it all go. I swear on your perfect blue eyes. Lily! Have you lost your mind. sis? lt's a great day to be alive. ain't it? lt's takedown time. Spoke to your parole officer today. Oh. nice suit. white trash. Did you rob a grave? Your jurisdiction ends on that side of the road. asshole. There isn't much people on either side of the road can agree on. Except that nobody likes you. Jimmy Cuervo. Goddamn. I guess I'll fire my publicist. You better be stopping in to say goodbye. Are you fucking kidding me? You're lucky. Bullet's still in your hand. asshole. Come midnight tonight. you're free to go. She's not. Lil? Lily? Lily? Oh. hell... "m just gonna say it. Lily lgnites The Dawn... Will you marry me? ? La la la la laa... - Lily? -? La Ia ? La la la ? La Ia ? La Roses? Lilies would have been better. But hey. it's your funeral. And you're late. lnjun lover. - Come on. - Nobody keeps the Grim Reaper waiting. - Luc! - Blue-eyed lnjun. And a cold-hearted killer. Just what the witch doctor ordered. "Romeo. oh. Romeo. wherefore art thou Romeo?" Looks like Juliet's left hanging. - Hang these. you bitch. Ugh. God! I never had the option to love someone like you. Is she a firecracker or what? - Didn't I tell you. Lo? - Yes. Luc. You told me. Appetizer was tasty. Bring on the main dish. She doesn't deserve this. Please. Please! Luc! I always liked you. kid. You should have just stayed on your side of the road. Perd?name. - "m sorry. - Jimmy... The object of war is not to die for your beliefs. but to make the other poor bastards die for theirs. Ever since we were kids in school. I always thought your eyes were so pretty. Lily. They've seen things. Mine? They've never seen shit. Sometimes. if your eyes can't see. you have to trade 'em in for a new pair. Time's a-wasting. Lo. Go in peace with our love. You will always be in our hearts. Your eyes will watch over us. Your spirit will always be nearby. We will treasure your memory until we meet again. Dude. that's Lily. Take flight. Mother. Magnificent fuckers. aren't they? You wanted to bone her since you were 1 2. Yeah. - Keep talking shit about my girl. - Go get 'em. Tonto. "By sun's dying flame. and Hades' wicked might" "l peer into the darkness" "To take hold of the light" Now I have the eyes of a shaman to unlock the spell. By sunup. you'll be Satan and that bitch's tribe will be history. Such a shame. Without her eyes. she'll be lost in the spirit world forever. Luc. Luc. You are gonna fucking die. Ah. Jimbo. you're breaking my heart. Hearts were made to be broken. "The killer's heart by love redeemed" "ln Satan's claw like ruby gleamed" I feel good. Pestilence? Famine? Take these rags to the dump and burn 'em. This place has been tearing me down. But "m finally crawling to the top. Shit. That's the freezer Momma used to lock me up in. She'd say. "lt's damnation in there. You ain't never coming out." Damnation sure is a happy place. Yeah. maybe. If you're dead. Kick us down a sign. What do you see with your new eyes? I see the devil rising up. He's gonna make all your dreams come true. Eat up. Partake in the deviled ham. eat of the deviled eggs. and for dessert. feast on devi"s food cake. Al flambeau. lt's all been dusted with Lola's magical peyote mix. What is this? Hm? Have we all forgotten... ..whose side you're on? Who's been holding you down? Who's gonna shut down the mines. putting your families out of work. just so they can open up a casino? War. Your people. they were enslaved. Hm? Why ain't there a goddamn government-backed casino in every street corner of the 'hood? Hm? For every one of them that dies. ten of us may die. But in the end. it's they who will tire of War. Now you're talking. Famine. Famine. You're the nearest thing to Montezuma for 500 miles. How come you ain't got a piece of that Aztec Casino pie? - Hell. yes. "d eat that shit up. - Yeah! - Pestilence. - Huh? Pestilence. do you want to be a real cowboy? How long you got to live before that toxic brew spreads cancer through your gut? Long enough to see the lnjuns burn. Tonight... Satan's gonna walk in my shoes. 'Cause tonight. we'll make 'em hurt. One by one. Tonight is about one thing. Revenge. Revenge. And who needs a wedding invite? Don't be late. We have to do this before sunrise or the power is lost. And we registered for one gift. A sacrificial virgin to seal our wedding vows. Pestilence. Go down to the bar and score some more peyote. I'm gonna go visit an old friend. - Oh. my God. Shut up! Oh. my God. what have I done? Oh. my God. oh. my God! You believed me when nobody else would. For once in my life. I wasn't alone. I always liked you. kid. But you should have stayed on your side of the road. Yeah. cut her eyes out! Cut her eyes out! That heart's beating. What am I? Hey. Barnaby. They're gonna love you at Rave-N Fest. I love you. You're not a killer. Murderer! Call the tribal council. We have to have a meeting. Tell my father Cuervo's done it again. If there's anyone here who objects to this couple... ? La la laa. la la laa ? La le lee. la la laa - Speak now. or forever... - Hey. Luc. I bet you that virgin bride tastes just like cherry pie. Here. don't lose your place. "Out of..." What? Good call. hawkeye. Hello. Moses. l... I don't want any trouble. You've done well for yourself. I've waited a long time for you to find success. - They're all useless sluts. - Please. son. The only thing I found is God. Who do you think stuffed your collections box every time the mortgage was overdue? God? I wanted you to taste success. so I could take it away from you. Who are you? I'll tell you for 47 dollars and 66 cents. Don't you see the resemblance to the preacher you shot down for the contents of his collection box? Wait. I paid for my crime. I did all this for your father. to make amends. I'm doing his work. I've changed. Hear that? He's changed. Moses. the wedding food is ready. Shh. Don't hurt her. - Hey. Lo. What? What are you doing? What are you gonna do... Pick it up. If you shoot me first. maybe she'll live. - Moses! Moses! - No! No! - "ve changed. - Moses. I need you... Get away! Moses. help me! - Go on. - I won't do it. "ve changed. - Moses. help! You bastard! - Get out of here and call the police! - Moses... Moses! Good God... Moses. oh. God. People don't change. Witnesses. Luc? I'm full. You take the leftovers. But leave the wife to suffer. Luc. where are you going with this? Let's just go. baby. Homeboy's just fucking with you. - Aren't you? - Blood alone spins the wheels of history. So I said to him. "Get your own whore!" ? The man in black rode down on a horse ? What course they'd run. he dare not recall ? He'd become a creature. thirsty and hungry... They just ain't smart enough to stay down where they belong. ?...kill them all They got to spread their little wings and fly up into the light. ? Perhaps their pain would help him remember The package you ordered is on its way. Cowboy. You said the peyote'd be here before dessert. And if it ain't... ...your head becomes a portal to the fifth dimension. Get it? You see that? There's a new sheriff in town. ? The creature sat naked... ? He held his heart in his hand. and he ate of it ? The man in black asked. "ls it good. friend?" Get off me. you damn hallucination. ? "But I like it. because it is bitter" ? "And because it is my heart" Boo. I guess Famine's momma was wrong about that freezer. Where's fucking Luc? He owes me two lifetimes and a set of perfect blue eyes. We misjudged you. For an lnjun-loving heartless convict. you sure got a lot of life in you. What I got in me... ...ain't life. Join the club. Ow! "Am I a man who dreamt he was a butterfly?" "Or a butterfly who dreamt he was a man?" I'm afraid of what "ve become. You tell 'em they should be too. "Oh. hell. "m just gonna say it." "Will you marry me?" Oh. shit! You're not a killer. Back when Lake Ravasu had a lake. I used to take her out on the water fishing. Time stood still when she laughed. They said smelting wouldn't make much mess. So I let 'em drain the lake. And when the miners came. I told Lily: "Mi hija. stay away from 'em. Stay on your side of the road." She knew better. Dear Heavenly Father... Let us pray. Give us the strength to forgive. And drain this outrage from our hearts. You will always be in our hearts. Your eyes will watch over us. Your spirit will always be nearby. Baby. I miss you so much. Make your camp here. What have you done to me? You made me a fucking monster. Dad. Did you catch him yet? No. He just took another one down. At the bar. I'll have the state troopers set up roadblocks. No. No outsiders. We've seen their kind of justice. They're the ones that set him free the first time. But. Dad. our authority ends at the reservation line. And we have our kind of justice. Now let's show the dark prince our worthiness. pilgrims. Herd these lambs for slaughter. Not all of them deserve to die. "Deserve?" Did your brothers deserve to die in mines that were dug too deep and too close to the water so they could profit? So. We haven't seen the last of War. now. have we? Only the dead have seen the last of War. I'm not gonna hurt you. Are you an angel? Or are you another devil? I don't know. Maybe both. - Come on. "m gonna get you out of here. - I can't go out there. I just want to die. I want to die. But we can't. Not tonight. All my life... No! ..."ve been pushing down this fire inside of me. Jimmy. stop! It just keeps coming back up. Jimmy. stop! Jimmy. stop. Stop. I'm so fucking tired of running. You didn't think "d recognize you? After what you did to our son? Your husband's still alive. His heart's still beating. Mary. Moses. Who are you? Dear God. - Maybe a ghost. - lt's a miracle. I'm sorry. I don't pretend to understand what just happened. But don't ask me to forgive you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Now it's time for Montezuma's revenge. I like it. Didn't we kill that guy? - I don't believe it. - The truth is. belief's not required. I know. He's the crow. Like in the legend. God is finally paying attention. Hello. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. Hi. Tell me. did the blood wash off? Or did you have to scrub really. really hard? Oh. Jimbo. man. Come on. it's me. Luc. Huh? I taught you how to fight. Showed you how to survive. And then cut out my heart. So let me get this straight. I mean. you're here to make wrong things right. That's funny. 'cause that's what "m doing. too. Wait. I have an idea. Maybe you two should form a club. Yeah. - "ve never been much of a joiner. - Oh. yeah. sure you are. Come on. Join us in iniquity. Hm? You can be my best man. How are you at wedding speeches? I'm better at eulogies. That's what "m talking about. What's the difference between me and you? Hm? I'm dead. Watch out. Jimmy. He's not the same man he used to be. War. What happens to an angel that loses his wings? He falls. "Hellfire rise" "The heavens drop" ? Ten little. nine little. eight little lndians ? Seven little. six little. five little lndians ? Four little. three little. two little lndians ? One little lndian boy lt's too quiet in here. Let's go. Daddy. - Where's my daddy? - Shh. lt's gonna be OK. - What the hell are you doing? - He took my hearse. - Who? - Jimmy Cuervo. He had a gun and a Rave-N Fest costume. Rave-N Fest? Don't just leave me here like this. Oh. fuck! When he was dead. he saw that he had not lived. Jimmy Cuervo. you're under arrest for the murder of Lily lgnites The Dawn. Come on. Tanner. I loved your sister. - You know I didn't kill her. - Bullshit. - I don't believe you. - Well... Go ahead. Shoot. lt's loaded this time. I'll kill you. Man. I wanna die. I want to die. Do it. Do it. please. Please. Go ahead. Join us in iniquity. You can be my best man. Lily. Lily. Killing is easy. Forgetting is hard. See you in iniquity. You think you can keep any crows from crashing the party? "Strength lies not in defense but in attack." Oh. hurry up. witchy girl. My biological clock is ticking. lt's not too late to break the spell. You know. we don't have to go through with this. We could just get back in the car. and head to the coast. What? Cold feet. baby? Come on. What do we have to worry about? Nothing. But did we bag a virgin? Our luck is changing. We just got one standing on the side of the road. - What the hell. Luc Crash. - Yes. Lola Byrne. Let's get hitched. - There's no place like home. - Yeah. Think your pimp shrimp's gonna flip out when he sees us? Let's hope he's sentimental. You were always bad for business. "m not saying the white weight ain't worth a lookup. I'm just saying don't buy from Smokey. Looking good. Carmen. - You missed me? - No. I was counting on never seeing your ungrateful ass again. You know. I gave you a chance to get out of here and make something of yourself. Nobody ever gave me nothing. Where is he? You know what else? You disrespect my man one more time.

I'd slice all your throats. but I gotta get to the burial grounds. Au revoir. She's itching for a climax. So I did what you wanted. Now it's time for you to ring my bell and lock the spell. And we're talking. what? Seven days. seven nights until you have to go back. Seven days? You're thinking way too small. princess. You're in for a seven-year itch you won't ever want to scratch. Ah! You want to see the Middle East. huh? It won't just be the Sahara desert that's burning hot. Pick any city. Paris? Rio? Carnival. Beijing? We'll stroll in. set a little spark like your little fucking mine and casino. and just watch 'em all cut each other to fucking pieces. You see. the world's like an angry dog on a choke chain. you know? It lunges. snaps and pulls. But the chain around its neck just gets tighter and tighter. It don't know that all it has to do to be free is let go. Huh. Oh. Don't fret. Fr?ulein. The apocalypse is gonna be one hell of a honeymoon. 'Cause in the morning we're gonna massacre that lndian tribe for you. and then move on to bigger and badder things. Take him down.

She believed in fairy tales. Who are you to tell me what she believed in? I'm the fairy fucking godfather that's gonna save your fairy fucking tails. - He's bleeding to death. - Help him. Help the crow. How could God pick such a man? Why not? She did. Lily believed in the old stories. Like the Crow Dance. They'll think I was a fool. They already do. Show 'em how fools dance. lt's your wedding night. little girl. And Poppy's a horny little devil. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. The book says you have to look at my eyes. The book says you have to look at my eyes. Oh. So close. The dark prince was almost crowned. baby. You can't stop. If the sun comes up and the spel"s undone. you're just gonna be a worthless punk. and I'll just be a piece of white trash. Luc. Luc! Oh. come on. Don't you have any respect for the dead?

Do you know what an angel without mercy is? Huh? lt's nothing but a devil. How about a little sympathy for the devil. huh? "l saw a creature." "He sat. and he held his own heart in his hands. and he ate of it." "l asked him. 'ls it good. friend?"' "He said. 'lt is bitter."' "'Bitter."' - "'But I like it because it is bitter."' - May God's fury rain down on you. "'And because it is my heart."' You have the right to remain silent. And anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you don't have one...
