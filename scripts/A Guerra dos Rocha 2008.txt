These jotters here. These, here, pink, blue, yellow green, this one... I'll fix this later. No, no, no, don't cry, my baby. They've left this in here. My God... What a mess. A whistle tea-kettle. We definitely don't like each other. It's mutual. But this dough needs rising. Now, All you have to do is taking this do Mr. Clovis... A whole night of work. Oh, this. Calm down, Carol. I've been the most sacrificed person with your mother living with us. Why? Cesar, I can't take it anymore of you working every weekend. I didn't see you leaving this morning. Cesar, you have a family, don't you know? That's the reason why, Julia. I have to support you all. Meeting with the clients, contracts reviews, meetings, meetings and meetings, and all, Julia.

How are you? - Fine, and you? - I'm fine. - Hi Ms. Dina, how are you? - Good. - You are Abilinho. - That's right. You're all grown up. How is your grandma? She's on it. She's being working out a lot. Don't you know any other expression other than "on it"? I do. "Off of it". There is a lot of people in here "off of it"... Listen, kid, is that about me? Bebel? Bebel, my darling. Soon it's your birthday, isn't it? - Yes. - Have you choose your present? Oh, no grandma. But I know what I don't want. - A stupid debutant party. - Bebel. Out to your room. Enough of it.

Julia, darling. You should talk more with your daughter. - Have you forgot you were 15 once? Who knows what is best for her it's me. Sure. I think you're a little bit over weight. Are you pregnant, again? So, Ms. Dina... What are you doing here? What are you here for? To stay. If you want me to sleep under the bridge, you can forget about it. My youngest child, Marcelo, expelled me. Since, I, only borrowed you this house. It is still mine. I'll go to my room. Just by looking at this jewel... I get emotional Oh, Armando... You were so handsome when you gave me this. So handsome. Cesar, my son. You have to be patient with Julia. I've already decided how to deal with her. Everything she tells me will come to this ear, and out from this. Mom, it doesn't work, mom. This proximity, You two were never friends. Something bad will happen. And I'll be involved on it. I will. I'm not feeling good. I'm feeling this pain on my chest. This isn't good. It looks like you have a chest. A pain here and there. Do you know what is it called? The Frog disease. It comes from swallowing lots of frogs. You should start spitting, Cesar. Spit. You're more pregnant then your wife. You know what's going to happen? Your wife is going to have a baby, and you're going to have a frog. I'm more pregnant than my wife, what do you mean? - She is pregnant. - Who's the father? - You. - Me? That's impossible, mom. Impossible. A mother's eye is never wrong. That small belly. Her bellybutton is out. It's a boy. A good one. Hey. What kind of news is that? Are you pregnant? That's outrageous. As far as I know, a child is conceived by a couple. If you decided to have a child... Mrs. Dina. I'm amused with your capacity of bringing chaos. Where can you see the belly? Where? Hello. Is there someone in there? Answer me. Sweetie, don't do that! It could hurt your baby. Enough! Mrs. Dina... I'm sorry, but you in this house, is too much. Perfect. - Did you get my boobs? - Sure, sure I did. Mine were sculptured. - Oh, What a nice glass. - That's a jar, darling. Thank you. My God. How can we start a day like that? I'm dizzy. Where should I go? It's... that way. That's right. Hi girls, sorry to interrupt, but I need Paola for a second. All the attention to Saraiva and his wife. They are the stone key to my trial. Talking about trial... where have you been this whole morning? Pupi, I was with Netinha, my friend. She lost her boobs. It broke open. It could've been with me. No, no, calm down, calm down. Dear Sir, Dear Sir. Look at this. Dear Sir, everything is under control. The ice, whiskey, and I even brought these petit fours. Nice, Marcondes. You're perfect. You're the best. Ouch, Ouch. My God, what's that? Live me alone. Saraiva. I need your help... for my absolution. Every chicken chirp. But in this coop you're the cock. We might be discrete. - Mom. - My son. What are you doing here? Do you have any idea of what I've been trough. Walking around, nobody wants me. That's why I'm here. To stay. What will they think, Mrs. Dina. Zeneide, could you borrow a dress of yours to Mrs. Dina. Yes, Mam. Excuse me. Mom, oh, mom. Mom. - Antonio Crispin. - Yes, Mam. - Could you take my mother-in-law home? - Yes, mam. I'll be right back, honey, Is that the best you can get, Zeneide? Zenaida. She disappears for hours, and no-one cares? Shit! What? It's breaking. It's breaking. It's an old lady, Marcelo. She can't be left alone, you see? She came to here. There no way. I can tell you that. We're going to solve it, today. Oh my God. Oh Zenaide, Zenaide. This dress makes me crazy. - Zenaide, Zenaide. - What's this? Help, pervert. Help, help. Pervert, help. Oh my God. Paola, darling. Your husband's adviser, Marcondes, is a pervert. He tried to grab be. Oh, Mrs. Dina. Don't make up stories. Guys, she is really creative. Pupi, we have to get rid of her. She is a bomb. A tsunami. Let's think positive. Thank you, Crispin. My keys? Can't find it. Where is it? Where is everybody? Marcelo! Carol! Dina! Hey Dina! Are you sightseeing? It is good to your health. Why so many policemen in here? - Do you want me to take care of it? No, Marcondes. The best thing you do is to be quiet. Julia, Cesar, open up! Let's get out from this dreadful place. It's not that bad. I was raised in here. But you left. If you liked here you would've stayed. Let's get out of here. No, it's not that bad. - It's open. No, no way. I won't take it, anymore. - It's our mom, do you remember? Yes, it's OURS. You're the one with more money. What? No, no, no, no, no. Don't even think about it. I have a young son. I've been with her much more then what we've agreed. - It's your turn, Marcos. No, she was with me, once. - No, it's Cesar's turn. - It's been years... it was before you got married to Paola, Marcos. I know. Why doesn't Cesar gives back mom's house, and find him his own? What she'd do here alone? Drag chain? - No way. He is useless, useless. Where is he? Hey, Marcelo. I still don't know what you are good for? I'm NOT good for your gang. That's for sure. - Don't talk to me like that. - We're in family. Do you want me to take care of it? Do you? - Not yet. - What a family. Which of you once worried about mom? This Marcos... He is packed with money. What has he done for her? Or for anyone in this family? Altruism was never a Marcos feature. He's been like that since ever. He's gave a car. A cute one. He did. But he'll take it back as soon as he needs it. He does nothing for free. Hey you, I think it's good... for you to watch it. 'Cause I'm about to loosing it. I haven't worked hard my whole life to support lazybones, and to be confronted like this. Worked hard? You never did that. But Cesar, otherwise... Work even on Saturday mornings to support this family. Ungrateful. Ungrateful children. This is not happening. I have to work, guys. - Paola, go make some salad. Paola, stay put. - Stay. - She is not your maid. - No, she is not. - Go make some salad. But Pupi told not to do it. Didn't you hear it? My God. What should I do? You're annoying me. Turn your claws to your husband. You, watch your words. She has a husband. A sick one. Always sick. I wonder who takes care of you. Dina! Dina! What? What happened? - Tea? - What? Respect my wife, you scum. - Dear Sir, Dear Sir. - Pupi. My God. It's becoming a tragedy. What was it? What is it? I can see a car. - Something happened - What happened? - It might be an accident. - There's always someone dying in here. That's horrible. It's dangerous. There's nothing we can do. Hey, where is mom? Marcelo. Where are you going? I'm going home to check if mom is there. Okay, okay. Okay, okay, I see. My driver left her at Marcelo's house. She is not in there. I've talked to everyone, nobody saw her. Did the driver waited for her to get in? He should do that. That's the rule. We can't leave an old lady alone on the streets. Really? What have you done to her... other than leaving her on the streets? This is her house, do you know that? You've left her on the streets like a beggar. - As a, a... - A homeless, sir, a homeless. Right, a homeless. And now you're accusing Dear Sir. It's too much, it's too much. Too much is to hear your voice in this house. One more word and I'll kick you out. You can pamper you Dear Sir, but respect my husband. What is happening dad? Hello! Hi Hi, Ms. Clovis. Look, something came up and I'll have... Hello! Hello! He hung up. I've got an idea. Let's search for her. - For who? - Your grandma, she disappeared, Bebel. Bebel, I'll let my baby with you. Everything he needs is inside this purse. Take care of him. Okay. I'm going to take care of your baby. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Bilinho. Come here? My mom is out. Oh, no, no. I'm not going to hang up. So, you're sure about that. No old lady, around 80, is in here? Old people is what we have the most. If you want to check for yourself... you can even choose one. She's not here, too. This is the last near hospital. Excuse me. I think it's better for us to wait at home. - What is it, Cesar? - I hate hospitals. Do you know how many germs are in here waiting for someone to pass by? Do you know. Under control, Sir. Under control. Senator Marcos Vinicius Rocha. Is he in here for surrender? Please, Sir. Lady, Mam. Here is a thing, officer. My mom, an 80 years old lady, is missing. We'd like to have your discreet and prompt help. Poor thing, officer. So, Mr. Marcos Vinicius, we can only consider a missing person after 48 hours. I had to heat everything up again. Bebel, come. No sign of her. Now, it's up to God. What should we do? A prayer? Bad news comes fast. Julia, you don't speak... you hurt. I have to go down, my mom is calling. - Wait, Bebel. - I really have to. Otherwise she'll go crazy. Your mom is not going to go crazy. She IS crazy. Julia thinks she is elegant. Imagine if she wasn't. I'm facing the facts. When someone at this age disappears, what could've happened? But I refuse to think like that. I don't know what I'm doing here, I don't like Julia. What the... Pupi, Pupi, my expensive dress. You, bitch. No phone right now. Hello. Hi, Mr. Clovis. Get out. Out. Hi, Mr. Clovis. Hello? Stop yelling. Hello? It's from the hospital. They're asking you to go there. It's about grandma. Call us as soon as you get news. Cesar, are you sure you don't want to go? It's your mom. We don't know it, yet. And I've been to the hospital. I was exposed to many germs. Okay. We call you. Kisses, honey. Let's go. She'll stay with him. She is like him. They'd be trouble in there. Bye, darling. Let's go. Dear Sir. Oh, My God. What is that? Is that her face? Dear Sir, Dear Sir. But... What happened to her? She was overran. By a truck. That's what was left. Is it really her? - Dear Sir? - It's her. It's really her. I'm sure. Look. Look. Why did I leave this happen? Do you expect something Got married, got Bilinho, got sick of his wife... hu-humm. And left me with a grandson to raise, Do you think it's nice? You know, Nono, about Cassiano, your son, I'd prefer to be quiet about it. Later we talk about that. Why, Dina? Do you know something I don't. I do. What? I know how stupid we are. Why are you saying that, Dina? Tell me. I'm leaving. - I want to know, Dina. - I need to face them. Give me, give me your watch. Hold it. Hold it, hold it. Go, go, go, go. What's inside these boxes, Curi? I don't know, Magro. But I think we were luck. Let's hide on that house. It might be empty. I know. Excuse me, Ladies. We're doing a market poll about a new product... - I'm not interested. - Wait, what's the product? This one grandma. Get inside, inside. - To the right. - Where? Seat down. Now what? What are we going to do with them? The policemen are around. Shut up, Magro. Shut up. I'm thinking. The thief is thinking. Get up, let's go. Get up, let's go. - Where is the bathroom? - It's upstairs. Go, go. I'm so worried with my grandma, Abilinho. Do you think it's really her? I think she's up to something. Help, open up. Open this door. They are destroying my house. We have to get out of here. Before they find my hiding place. Don't worry. No-one is going to look under your mattress. Mattress? Do you think I'd put money under the mattress? "Pur prehaze!" What a name for a candy. Magro, my friend. I know this leaf. Me too. It's a good stuff. Hey, brother. This candy is crazy. As they say, - it's "bueno". - "bueno". What? What is it? Help me to get up here. Wait, be careful, go. Nono, Nono, come here, Nono. The mailman. - Hel... - Quiet. Are you crazy, don't yel. Two old ladies, undefended. Let's put this there. Maybe he went there, in the back. While we were fighting, mom... a disaster like that makes us to think a lot. Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir. Oh, My God. By this time Cesar might be on his 5th sedative. A news like that, he won't take it. You're so hot. Only I know that. Hold me tight, hold me tight. Do anything with me, Cesar. Tell me something? If Pupi goes to jail. Will you take care of me? We'll talk about it after the trial. Come, hottie. Come? Come? Jesus Christ. My God, I'm not seeing that. - Oh, that's outrageous - What? It should have a witness, Nono. What? - I'm not delirious, am I, Nono? - No. What I saw is real, right? Yes, you saw it. You did, and so did I. What a shame. Now it's been proven who's the bitch in this family, it's Paola. And Marcos is a cuckold. Oh, poor man. He thinks he's the best. All stuck up and cuckold. And by a brother. Listen, Nono. It's polite, when a friend is suffering, as I am, the other shouldn't increase the pain. But if you want to talk about my family, I think I can do the same. Because your son it's not better than mine. What?! You didn't even know Cassiano. How could you say something? Oh, but it's not me who is talking. Everybody is. - And you know that. - What? Your boy was always fragile, always weird, a little... feminine, a flower. And you know that, because you made him to get married, - and he gave up. - What did he give? What did he give? Don't make me laugh. If my son is cuckold, yours is a cock sucker. Repeat that? Repeat what you just said? He's a queen, a queer. He's a fag, gay. And you know that. All I know is that you're an old liar. A crazy old lady. A story maker. - Me? - Yes. Get out of my house. I'm the crazy one? How can I get out of here? We're stuck inside this bathroom. Stuck in this unbearable acquaintance. See what women are like? By the time they get older they fight even more. It's your fault! You started it. - Me? - Yes, you did. - Insolent. - You're insolent. Who is inside my house arguing with me. You're stupid, but you saved me. Because I can't take anymore of her. - I'm going to sue you. - Let's calm down. We've came at peace. - Cock Sucker - Me? - Cuckold What? What? Oh, no, mom. It can't be. But it's true, darling. Believe me. Life is like this. She's in a better place. She's rested. We have to keep things going. Keep up with the preparation of your birthday party, next week. - Prepare... - Mom, Are you crazy? My grandma just died. And you're talking about a party? Enough! I hate you. - Bebel. - Let me go. My left arm... it's paralyzing. Julia, bring me my sublingual medicine. Ouch, I just hit, shit. It looks like you liked it. What is happening to me? I can't remember mom's face, Marcos. A friend of mine had the same problem. She had to put her mother's picture on the grave so she could remember her. Paola, please, Paola. It would be better if you just be quiet. Well, soon they will deliver Mrs. Dina's body. We have to call everyone. I thought I was going to give a party. Now I have to prepare this house to a death-watch. We don't want any old ladies fighting in here. Hey, you. Let's eat candies. What kind of candies are those? "Bueno" What's that? It all started with a bread machine, a modern machine that they add everything... My God, a devil's machine. Flour, baking powder, water, and then it starts to bum, bum, bum... It exploded on everyone's face. On Carol's face. She took a skillet to protect herself. - I want more candy. - Cool, grandma. It's the best stuff. Look, son. Grandma, it's your fucking mother. More candy, and less intimacy. I'm hungry. Hey you, Mr. Refrigerator. This is a robbery. Hey, Mr. Refrigerator, do whatever they want. Do not react. Do not react. - Hey, Magro. Lasagna, Dude. - No, no. In this house nobody touches the stove. Really? Why? Shaman Fire-Holder told me that. Why is that? Don't be a party-pooper. You could've put it under the mattress. It would've been more... What's that? I want more candy. Candy. Let's use these pile of papers that your mom sent. Look how nice. Look, she's sent a lot of papers. Look. Julia, what a horrible thing. We've came to say good-bye to our beloved friend. Go there, Nair. Do your best. She is a wonderful make-up artist. She came to make Diva looks wonderful. Diva has to look like... a princess. Leda brought a beautiful dress that Diva loved. - Show it, Leda, Show the dress. - Show it. Show it, Leda. I don't think this dress will be appropriated. Girls, Neide, Jurema, come here. Come and check this out. Where did they do to her face? Were you close friends? Friends in the childhood, lovers in the youth, then she got married, we lost contact, and when we got back this disaster happens. But you... What's your name? - Vicente Moratorio. - He's the bakery's owner. Cesar, Cesar, I think he was fucking our mother. I'm going to put some music on. They've forgot about the lasagna. The stove is safe. Well. Let's start now the press conference. One question at a time. - I'd like to have a look at the... - Attention. Action. No, no, no, no, no. Why this bunch of reporters to interview you? It looks like you've died, Marcos Vinicius. That's what I was thinking? Who brought up all these people? Your popularity. - Look Julia, you really... - Sir, Sir... Watch it, Sir. Leave it alone. It's good for your image. Specially now with your trial. You have to agree with me, a mother's death will get you around 300 thousand votes. But a fight during the death-watch, can cost you around 100 thousand. That's right. Specially here with these people. You're completely exposed. You can't answer anything. These people? Am I these people? Funny, This afternoon you seemed not to have a problem with these people. This horrible house. Leave it Pupi. I'll help you to defend yourself. Cesar, what was that with Paola? Look, don't even start, Julia. Don't start. If I'm not enough for you it's because someone is talking my place. Who is she? Cesar? Cesar! Well... I'm not going to allow you to turn my mom's funeral into a show for you to get more votes, Marcos Vinicius. - I won't let it. - It's an emotional moment, as you all can see, my mom is on that table, and we're really emotional. My brother is really out of his mind, - accusing me. - Oh, Pupi. He is accusing me. End of the show, Carol. I'm going to take my son and leave from this hell. Poor mom. Let's go. Marcelo, Marcelo, for God sakes. He is my boss. Hello, Mr. Clovis? Can you do me a favor? - Go to hell. - What's that, Marcelo? Marcelo, he's my boss, are you crazy? Do you want me to get fired? I'll be the judge. Let's play, let's play. It's a wonderful game, because in it, everything is allowed. - You know. - Oh, wait. I want to talk to my girl. Of course, of course. If you want we could've send you to her. Can I go, too? Of course. Nono? Can you find us some cute ropes, to tie them together, as a gift wrap. Do you know what am I going to do? I'm going to play, too. I'm going to talk with the beyond. Who? With Armando. But he is dead. But that's the game. Nono. And you two, stand-up and stay over there. So she can tie you beautifully. Turn back one to each other. This way, quiet. Right. Hello, it's from the poli... Armando? I miss you, Armando. I'm calling... I calling from Nono's house. She invited you to come over, fast. What are you doing? It's none of your business. What has happened here? Let's go. Let's get out from here, now. Take your son. Shit, Hell. - As I was saying... - You're going to find me a job, because I've just lost mine. Carol, how could you do that, right in the middle of this. A serious interview like that. Watch the nepotism. Nepotism? Nepotism? Who are you to talk about it? You, who do all these dirty things to the people. Look, he's corrupt. A fucking thief. Fucking thief. You don't delude anyone. - Do you think you delude someone? - Please, just forgive my sister-in-law. She is emotional. After all, my mother is dead on that table. - In a very... - Hello? Turn that off. There's been a kidnap on the other side of the street. Let's go there. It's not good. What should we do? The only thing we can do, Anita, let's sing. This is not necessary. Your wives are going to be happy. Here, here. Everything will be fine, Bebel. Easy. Hey, grandma, you've betrayed us. - Look. It's my home. - It's your grandma. - Let's go there. Do you know why it happened? So you can respect the entities. Not fair. Don't tell me you were enjoying it. Enjoying? No. I was loving it. I was never that happy, in my whole life. Are you crazy? I was. Now the police has arrived, and finished with everything. - Oh. - Excuse me. Grandma, how are you? I can't believe it. Julia, What is that? It's my mother's trunk. What are you doing with that? Where did you find it? She kept her jewelry in there, Julia. - Jewelry? - Marcelo, it's mom's trunk. You were trying to break into that? What? Do you think I'll end up with nothing? I'm a rational woman. I just wanted to know what was inside. Liar. You were trying to take Mrs. Dina's jewelry. No-one is going to open it without a lawyer. I am a lawyer. Let's open it. Why are you talking about this trunk? It's nothing. I want to know about this house. Why should Cesar keep the house When we have a young son to raise. I'm not leaving this house. Even if you tie me up. You're going to leave as a dead person. Do you want me to take care of her? I think it's better for us to sing, because things are hitting up. Oh no, no. Shut the fuck up. I'm not feeling good. Get me out of here. Take me home? I want to go. Paola, do you think I'm leaving my mother here, only because you want to go home? You're not leaving because of your inheritance. This is not a share, anymore. It is a shred. - Let's stop with it. - Stupid. I've told you I'm not leaving. Let's tie her up. Okay, it's open. Calm down, people. We've put up with Mrs. Dina the most, We should stay with this house. We should've put her in a care center. It would've been easier. It wouldn't. She would've escaped. Than we'd be crazy. I'm going to pass a bill, you know, to teach the youth how to deal with the elderly responsibilities. Then they won't be lost like us, a bunch of old guys who don't know what to do. It's Dina. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia... It's Dina, it's Dina. Mom? That's the elderly responsibility. I might be in the wrong house. I might be with the wrong children. I don't recognize you. I didn't hear what I hear. Armando, Armando. What kind of people have we raised? Enemies. Do you want to know what do I think about you? You, Marcelo, have you ever done something good in your life? You have a son which you can't provide. - For how long? - Mom, calm down. We were watching your body. For us you are a ghost. What we've told was under the effect of the pain. So, the ghost it's going to tell you everything he saw at the other life. You, Cesar. He saw you kissing Paola, your brother's wife. Kissing and hugging, a real porno scene. For how long are you going to keep up with that? Cuckold. Is that true, Paola? No, no, of course not, Pupi. Your mom is making that up. She's crazy. Don't touch Mrs. Dina. She'll be my witness at the divorce. Cesar, I'm going to grab you pants, your underwear, and everything that inside it. You, Marcos, you knew you were married to a whore, but I didn't know I was married to an asshole. Pupi, Pupi, You know me. You know I wouldn't be involved with a guy like that, poor like him. Cesar, I'm going to kick your ass. - Marcondes! - Yes, Sir? Come here. Kick his ass. But with your hands closed. - Stop. Stop that. - I'm a sick man. Stop. Oh my God. Excuse me, is this the Rocha's house? - Yes. I'm Saul. I came from the hospital. The gave me your address. You might be the body's owner, right? - Yes, I am. - Oh, okay. Let's check it... Where is the body? Come, Nono, Let's go there. There was a mistake, this is not your mother. It's my Raquel. Nono, look what they've done. Don't worry Mr. Saul. You've lost your wife, but I've lost three sons. I just want you to know, that after what I've been through, with this family, if there is something valuable in this trunk, it's mine. So, that was all you're worried about? Take it. - It's mine. - Take it, Marcondes. Leave it. What is it? Where are the jewelry? There's only this one. Pictures. - Marcos, you look like dad. - I remember this day. What is this? Irck Mom. She kept my prepuce. Look, she kept my tooth. She kept it. Look. The kite. Love, honesty, trust. That's what makes life, relationship, and a carrier. That's why I'm your candidate. Long live Dear Sir! No, no, not now. Not now, darling. and I'll be all yours. - The sun comes... - From far, from far... - It's better. - Much better. Dad's music, darling. - Come here, my son. - It's Dad's music. - See how nice. - Watch the cartoons, how wonderful. Nice! Oops, sorry. Sorry. - Hello? - Ok, I'll tell her, no problem. Mr. Cesar, stupid as always. Do you believe he wanted to know if the money he and his brothers gave to Mrs. Dina's trip was well used. Believe it?
