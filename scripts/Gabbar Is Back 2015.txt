Quiet. - Who are you? Take whatever you want. We want your husband. - Take him. Come on. Hello.. What? Nanded's Collector has been kidnapped, sir. What? Sir, Nashik's Collector has been kidnapped. Nashik? No, you mean Nanded. Don't confuse us. Sir, Vijay's calling from Nashik. Nashik's Collector has been kidnapped. Sir, news from Latur. There's been a kidnapping. Sh", Sang too. Listen..this is front page news. Stop the press! Stop the press right now! Maharashtra in great danger. 10 collectors go missing overnight. The police have setup check posts across the state.. ...after the kidnapping of the Collectors. Everyone is asking the same question. Who is behind this? 'Only one man can save you from Gabbar's fury.' 'Only one man.' 'Gabbar himself.' Sir..10 Collectors go missing suddenly.. ...and the Home Ministry hasn't issued any statement yet. This incident happened three days ago, sir. Can you tell me what you are all doing? Look, we're investigating the matter. Soon we'll know who is behind all this. Sir. Mr. Minister, the role of the police is being questioned.. ...what are your comments on it? I've organized a Special Task Force. And Commissioner Panth is heading this team. What? Don't worry, sir. We'll find the Collectors. I am there. - I see. Jai Hind, sir. We just received news, sir. All the Collectors have returned.. ...to the places from where they were kidnapped. Oh..good news. Let's announce this quickly. - Sir.. There's a problem. Only nine of them have returned. What? Where's the 10th one? Go up. Bribe has become like an offering. It's become a necessity to offer one before doing anything. Every Legal Department.. ...has turned the life of every common man like a newspaper. It starts with turning the pages on the commode. And by nightfall.. ...it's lying in some corner like waste. But no more. Every Friday, one government officer will be relieved. Either from corruption, or this world. And yes.. I am neither legal..nor illegal. I am not a politician..nor terrorist. Deeds of a hero.. name of a villain. I am..Gabbar. Gabbar. Everyone's deed will be revealed. You see..Karma cannot be bribed. This CD shouldn't leak out at any cost. Just now a person called Gabbar has sent a CD to our channel. Let's hear what's on the CD. This is the CD of Gabbar.. ...which is available at every corner of the country. Look at the huge crowd.. ...which has gathered around to buy this CD. And not just that.. ...this video has gone viral on all social media sites.. ...and it's been shared by everyone. I'm the Gabbar. Will killing a middle-aged man solve corruption? No. I think this is right. Don't you see, corruption has turned into a race. And anyway, if the winner gets death in the end.. ...then, they will all start running backwards. How did those Collectors take the money.. ...what time.. and from whom. And how they used that money.. ...where they invested that money. He's also got a copy of their property papers. Sir, this Gabbar has done a CBI level inquiry. Yes, sir. No outsider can gather all this information. Someone's definitely giving him all this information.. ...from inside the office. Who could it be? - Sir, it can be someone.. I get it, sir. I get it. 10 kidnappings. 10 officers. This means a team of 10 people. This isn't the job of 10 people. Sadhu, you talk more than you're paid for. Tell me something. How many Collectors in Maharashtra? - How many? And how many did they abduct? - How many? - Yes, 10? So. One man is enough to plan everything. But how many men do you need for the kidnapping. One man alone can't change the tires. - Correct. You need at least 2-3 people to abduct someone. So how many for 10 people? 20-30? This is the job of an organization. They don't hide in the jungles like the Renegades.. ...in fact, they're operating right here from the city. And you're not doing your job. - My job? Get some fritters quickly. - That fatso will explode someday. And don't forget the red sauce. Last time you forgot, and I had to face the music. These people will keep pouring sauce on their fritters.. ...and Gabbar will do his thing. Hurry up, Adi sir's class is about to begin. Come on. Is everyone here? Let's take attendance. - Forget it, sir. There must be more than you expect. Who would want to bunk your class? Is that sure? - Definitely. Fine, let it be. The world is made of five elements.. ...and so is our body. And similarly, Force is made of five elements. Can anyone tell me what the elements are? No, sir. No? Listen carefully. It's Tension. Compression! Sheer! Bending! And..Twisting! If we translate this in Hindi.. ...we'll call it.. 'Khichav' Tension. 'Dabav' Compression! 'Tod' Sheer! 'Mod' Bending! And.. 'Ghumav' Twisting! Didn't get it? No, sir. Well, let me explain it practically. Come on, get lost. Get lost, college is closed. Get lost. Come on. Get lost. Come on. Young man, come up. Listen carefully. Without moving your feet.. Raise your hand. Try to push me. College is closed. Get lost. Hey teacher, college is closed today. Come on, get out. Go, go.. College is closed. Come on, get out. Come on. Doesn't this look like.. ...two bulls are clashing each other. This is called 'Compression Load'. What is it called? Louder? 'Compression Load'. - Perfect. So first you learned 'Tension Load'.. ...and now 'Compression Load'. - Hey..enough of your antics. Go back. Go home. Come on. Come with us. Come on. The college won't shut down. Who are you? Some Gabbar has killed the Collector. This isn't Law and Order. The Home Minister has to resign. Until then.. - The exam schedules are already out. This college won't shut down. I see..the college won't close down! Break everything. Come on. - Now it will shut down. We won't tolerate this hooliganism. You want to see hooliganism. This is the third Force. Listen carefully. When you press something from both sides.. ...and put pressure on its Tension point. Break it! Should I break it? - Break it! Fine, now watch the breaking force. Break it! Who are you? You're done for. This is Bending. Now..I'll teach you about Twisting Force. Aditya! What are you doing, sir? I was just taking my class, sir. Stop it! Leave him! As you all saw, Physics is useful in everything. Tension. Compression. Sheer. Bending.. ...and the last one, sorry I couldn't show you. Twisting. And listen all of you. Even the Police aren't allowed inside this campus. And you are all goons. So don't even think about it next time. Understand. What did he say? Even the Police aren't allowed inside the campus. So how did the goons get in? The college gate is the problem, right? What if the gate isn't there anymore? Break down the gate. None of you ever went to school.. ...that's why you want to break down this college gate. Come fellas, it's time for your roll call. Come on. What's your age? What's your age? What's your age? I know yours. No, sir. Sir, he told me to. I will never go near any college again. Good boy, you've learn enough. Class dismissed! Hey..stop! Stop! Madam, are you crazy? - Shut up. I need your car, just wait. Come on, hurry up. - Don't worry. Careful. Slowly. Madhu, don't worry. What are you waiting for? Open the door. Come on. It's okay, come on. Madhu, sit comfortably. Get to the hospital, okay. - Yes. Never seen a pregnant lady before? Let's go quickly. Come on. Keep breathing, it's all okay. Come on, fast. Take the next left. Keep breathing. Right, take a right. Just a little longer, hold on. Take the next left. Look forward, what are you staring at? We returned home from the party.. ...and her labor pains started. No one's up for doing a good deed these days. No one bothered to stop their car. Thank God you came. Keep breathing, Madhu. Keep breathing. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop the car! I think her water just broke. I will have to deliver the baby right here. Are you a doctor? - No, I am a lawyer. But I've done research on Google. Get down from the car, please. Are you sure? - Do I look like I am joking? Get down from the car. Get down. Okay..now, ready? Come on, keep breathing. Come on.. Hello. Yes, Ravi. Okay ready. Now push. Did you prepare the list for Nagpur and Pune? Okay. Keep it ready. Excuse me, mister. I need your shirt. What? Take off your shirt, quickly. Give it. Excuse me, mister. Come here. What's wrong with you? Come on, we've to get to the hospital. Come here. Baby.- Doctor, I cut the umbilical cord.. ...with a Swiss army knife, is that okay? It's okay. - Okay. Don't worry.. you go. I hope she's okay, doctor. Hurry up and take her in. - Okay. Shruti..how is Madhu? - Don't ask. I had to deliver the child on the way. I wasn't this tensed even during my bar exams. Anyway, everything is okay now. Oh God, bless that man. I forgot all about him. Excuse me.. Shruti. Excuse me.. Hello! I wonder who he was. Like they say.. This is how Angels come. He really was an angel. He's a devil. The other 9 Collectors have gone blank.. ...like someone's erased their memory card. They were locked in a dark room for three days. And suddenly they were released. Now nobody's uttering a single word. Sir, these are officers. We can't be strict with them either. I don't want to hear this or that. If someone's got an idea, then speak now. Sir. Sir. Why are you raising your hand? Sir was asking if someone's got an idea. Who are you? - Constable Sadhuram. I am Yadav sir's driver. I brought his medicine. Digestion. So why did you raise your hand? Sir, I have an idea. - I've got 'Airtel'. Come here. Come here. Bravo. You brought my medicine, didn't you? Now get us some fritters. Yes. - Run along. Sir, in every office.. - Hey, Sadhu. You're a driver, aren't you? So act like one. Drive the car, don't rack your brains. Sir, I was just.. - Hey..do you think you're James Bond. Did you ever take a look at yourself in the mirror? Get out, come on. Get lost.. Sir, if you just listen to me.. - Have you gone deaf? Get out. Didn't you hear? Get out. Sir. Hey fool, don't forget the red sauce. My driver's become James Bond. Sadhu! Sadhu! Hey, Sadhu! Why do you lock horns with these officers? Officers? My foot. 100 meters in 15 seconds, can they do it? No. 100% in UPSC, CFPF. Can they do it? No. 100% of everything. 100 ideas to give my best shot, but.. Bribe wins against talent, so I lost. Do you get angry in English? I am not angry. Law runs through my blood. All my ancestors were in the police. I was selected for Sub-Inspector, but.. ...since I couldn't pay bribe, I became a constable. But..by solving this case.. ...I will earn my cap of an inspector. How will you solve this case? It's easy to spot the anomaly in the crowd. Meaning? I mean one can easily spot the honest one.. ...amongst the corrupt ones. I will go to every office and find that one man. You're a driver, why would they send you? I will take a medical leave. Medical leave? One small lie is okay for exposing a big truth. Gabbar. I'll get him behind bars. Shruti madam, what have you done? You put a dent on the boss' new car. What? Why are you screaming? He won't spare us. We will all lose our jobs. I didn't do anything. Why are you screaming? What happened, driver? Sir, Shruti madam slammed into your parked car. I was drinking tea. I saw it with my own eyes. No, sir. Why don't you learn to drive first? Look at this dent. You put a dent on my car, now you will have to pay. Sir, I didn't put a dent on your car..so why should I pay? My driver saw you, with his own eyes. Eyes can be deceived too, sir. I can prove that I didn't do it. Give me two minutes, sir. - Fine. I'll give you two minutes. You saw me put a dent on this car? - Of course. You did it. - Not at all. You took the car outside and got this dent somewhere else.. ...and now you're blaming me. Sir, three days ago he wanted to borrow 500 rupees from me.. ...to which I clearly refused. Did you not? Sir, I.. - Sir, according to Google.. ...80% men think women don't know how to drive. That's why his testament cannot be accepted.. ...because he's bias against women drivers. Sir, I am innocent. Absolutely innocent. Sir, I know who put a dent on your car. - Who? She did. - Her? Yes. - When did you see me do it? When you were driving your scooty at 45 km/h. You lost your balance. You tried to apply the brakes, but it was too late. You slammed your scooty in his car. You're lying. What proof do you have? Proof? Yes. - You want proof? Yes. Sir, I have a suggestion. Let's go take a look at her Scooty. It must still have the paint of your car. Come on, sir. No..no need. - Come on. Come on. Sir..why are you listening to him? Come on. - He's just a stranger. Listen to me. See, sir..didn't I tell you? I have nothing to do with this girl. I don't even know her. Nor did I borrow any money from her. I have no agenda, sir. - Sir, that's more than my salary. All I have is 50 rupees. Sir.. The rest will be deducted from your salary. Sir.. - Driver, let's go. Get lost! Why did you have to intervene? Do you know that driver's salary? It's half of what you get paid. - Oh, you're one of those. Yes, I am one of those. Hey, listen. Remember that kid we delivered in the car. His naming ceremony is on Friday. You must come. We delivered a kid? The one in the car. We had a kid in the car. - Shut up. By the way, I am Shruti. Gabbar. I am back! Our system has become like children's diaper. Wet in some places.. ...and a little loose in other places. There's only one thing we do honestly. And that's corruption. Releasing this Friday..PWD. It's actually.. the Public Works Department. But due to some people.. ...it's been troubling people the most. But now Gabbar will wield his PWD. Power-Wan Danda (The Power Stick). Power in wrong hands can cause a blackout. 2nd September. Remember this date. Because on this day.. ...one chair in PWD will be vacated forever. Get lost, you dog. Don't let me see you here again. It's alright if you don't want money.. ...but don't abuse me. This is wrong. - What's wrong, mister? He's not ready to take bribe.. ...how will this country run? Corruption has retired from this office. Why is that? If one man gets a heart-attack.. ...everyone in the neighborhood starts jogging. Similarly, since one Collector was murdered.. ...all the others mended their ways. Go.. Was everyone here corrupt before that? Yes, all of them. Except for a handful. Who is that? Well..like that Anuj More. Anuj More? Who else? Everyone? You too? Yes, Laxmi. Sadhu, where are you? I am in Sangli. Gabbar's sent another CD. "2nd September." "Remember this date." "Because on this day.." ..."one chair in PWD will be vacated forever." "And all you corrupt people.." ...if your heart starts feeling restless.. ...then know that Gabbar is somewhere close. What is his motive? Who is Gabbar? I am Gabbar. This is the film we should be making, Mr. Producer. Can we get the rights? The police couldn't find him, how can you? How will you join his group? Tell me. "Everyone has to pay in the end." "Be a little scared, son." "Or Gabbar will show up." "Do whatever you want." What's wrong, sir? You look worried. Don't ask. Who knows which office Gabbar is going to target next. It's making me sick. That's true, sir. If they make a list of our department.. ...your name will be on the top. Isn't it? You had to rub it in, didn't you? I've no clue whether my BP's getting high or low. And you're putting salt on my wounds. And that Ramesh Pawar.. he's corrupt too. Sir, he's got 8.1 billion. But he's still 100 million short of you. Hey..10 again. - Yes, so? Well..Gabbar kidnaps 10 people. Your lucky number is 10. Shut your mouth! What about that Raj Naik. Since the day Gabbar killed that Collector.. ...everyone has stopped taking bribes. Lord..Sai Baba protect me. Hello, sir. Sir, did you sign my file or not? We already gave you 15 million in advance. And here's the rest of the 15 million. Thank God you're here. You gave me 15 million, right? Hold on. Here's your 15 million. Take it back. And come with me. - But.. Come on. Come.. - But listen to me. Come on. Listen, everyone. Please listen.. It's a question of my life and death, please. Look, someone from this department.. ...has been telling Gabbar that I take bribes. And that's why I have decided.. ...that I will no longer take bribes. I took 15 million from this contractor.. ...to get his job done. And I am returning his money to him. Here you go. No, it's okay. - Take it, mister. Do you want to get me killed? Take it. I will sign your file, if it's correct. I will return everyone's money in cash. And those who sent me money from outside.. ...I'll send their money through money-order. Sir, we have only 24 hours. There are more than 2000 PWD officers in the state. We cannot provide protection to everyone, sir. But we can protect corrupt officers. Correct! Great idea, sir. Gabbar will go after them. Find out who are the most corrupt officers of PWD. Sir, no officer will ever claim that he's corrupt. Correct. Which fool will admit that he's a thief? Honestly, sir, I am the most corrupt officer. I need police protection. Look, this is a list of my corruption. Hey..I've already completely half century. 50 million. Sir, please save me. My name is on the top of Gabbar's list. Why? Did Gabbar fax you his list? Sir, please. Please. What? Sir, give me your account number. I'll give you half of whatever I have. But enter my name in the top 10 corruption list, please. And you want my name to be on Gabbar's list, instead of you. Do you think I am crazy? Get in the line. Sir! Sir! Sir, while we were busy giving protection to PWD.. ...Gabbar kidnapped the District Collector. This was all a distraction, sir. Oh no. Alert all the police stations. Find out where he's keeping the District Collector, okay. Sir, what about them? Collect all their files and send it to the ACP. Don't spare anyone. Pawar! Close the gates. Don't spare anyone. This is wrong, Thakur. When he said he will abduct someone from PWD.. ...then, he should've stuck to his word. He cheated us. It's not cheating, Yadav.. ...he tightened the noose around all of them. And..he's Gabbar, not Gandhi. Do you know who I am? Gayanand Sawant. Vaibhav Munde. Parshuram Wadekar. Pramod Naiyyar. Do you know who they were? These four are from the 877 farmers.. ...who committed suicide last year. Because the river water which was meant for them.. ...was diverted to the sugar factory, private sector.. ...and the Minister's farmhouse. And their fields remained dry. And in return.. ...you..received 180 million! I did exactly as the Minister asked me to do. The Minister was the one who paid me. Why should I care about the Minister? Most of the politicians in this country are illiterate. They are criminals. But you're a Collector. You were educated. You swore to serve the people. What were you doing? You very well know.. ...you could've saved all those farmers lives. But what did you do? You took bribe from the Minister. Now you have to take..what lam giving you. Listen to me.. Please. Please. Please, don't do this. Give me one chance. I swear I won't take bribes again. Sir, please.. I am sorry, sir. The new password for making mistakes. If sorry could fix everything.. ...then there would be no courts, or police stations. I hate sorry's. Why was a government officer hanged publicly? The hanging has created a lot of stir.. ...in the state of Maharashtra. The police haven't found any clue yet. There's terror in the city. Government officers are clearly in fear. There's a stir amongst the government officer. You were on the way, when we first met. We've a big contribution in your birth. Yes. Yes, baby. This is a small token on my behalf. How cool, Adi. Do you like it? May I? - Of course. Okay . . There you go. Okay. Please come here, Madhu. Return gift. Oh my baby. Take off your clothes. - Huh? Take off your shirt. Every time we meet, why do you make me take off my shirt? Take it off. Are you a murderer? What? You must do something similar. I didn't understand. This scar. It was an accident. Of course it was an accident, stupid. That day when you were holding the baby.. ...you had tears in your eyes. You're so sensitive.. ...how can you ever kill anyone. "Our eyes are meeting.. while sipping coffee." "Our eyes..are swaying with the breeze of love." "This feeling right now.. feels really great." "it's the intoxication of first love." "..of first love." "it's a new experience." "My eyes convey.." "Come dwell in my sights." "Even if you have to steal my slumber away." "Hey O.." "Hey O..l am in love." "it's the intoxication of first love." "Hey O.." "Hey O..l am in love." "it's the intoxication of first love." "My breath is suddenly rising." "The eyes express.." That's right. "My breath is suddenly rising." "The eyes express.." "..your interest in me is growing." "This feeling right now.. feels really great." "it's the intoxication of first love." "Of first love." "it's a new experience." "My eyes convey.." "Come dwell in my sights." "Even if you have to steal my slumber away." "Hey O.." "Hey O..l am in love." "it's the intoxication of first love." "it's the intoxication of first love." "Our eyes are meeting.. while sipping coffee." "Our eyes..are swaying with the breeze of love." Do you know why you can't walk straight after drinking? Why? Because the feet say.. You picked up the glass with your hand.. ...gulped it down the throat, gave a hangover to your brain.. ...but you never asked us. We won't walk. You're crazy. Absolutely crazy. You know, you don't just treat me to good liquor.. ...you're also a nice guy. We at the bottom always know.. ...how to grease someone's palm, right? Yes. When the Collector died.. ...all the police officers came to our office. I was right there. - I know. But no one asked me anything. Nothing. Nonsense.. Pappu..this is a list of your office staff. Now tell me.. who scrapes the most icing. Like Vijay Mathur, Rakesh Kamble.. - This.. Vijay Mathur. - Vijay Mathur. He recently bought a big car. This big. - I see. Yes. He gave 150 kilos of gold in his daughter's marriage. 150.. This..this, this..this.. All of them. They are all corrupt. No.. This..no.16.. Wasim.. - Wasim Sheikh. Wasim Sheikh. Honest. - Really. But.. This Wasim Sheikh, he's a great guy. But you know, he'll starve to death. Starve to death. - Yeah, take it from me. He'll starve to death someday. Wasim Sheikh. Wasim Sheikh..honest officer. Nashik. Varsha Raje. Anuj More. Gobind Gawde. How did they form a team? Did you know that a man's brain.. ...is 10% bigger than a woman's brain. Really? Excuse me. Hey..hello. Wait. But according to Google, the female brain works faster. You and that Google. You know, there should be.. ...a Google temple right beside Babulnath temple. Hail Google-nath! Hail Google-nath! - Shut up. According to Google, 12% of road accidents.. ...occur because people use their mobile phone.. So many tests for a minor injury. Is it really necessary? Get these tests done.. ...otherwise you're going to blame us. No, ma'am, nobody is going to blame you. All I wanted to say was.. ...I was right there when the accident happened. It was not a major accident. Then why did you come here? You could've bandaged that at home. This is the problem with educated people today. They think they're doctors. Doctor, they're insisting on a normal delivery. You've been working here for so many years.. ...but you still don't know how to talk to the patients. Tell him caesarian is absolutely safe. It's safe. But doctor, they're willing to wait.. ...until it's not a normal delivery. How will the hospital make money if it's a normal delivery? And how will we pay your salary? Normal delivery is not possible. You must go for C-section. If they wait, we will not be responsible. Tell them some big medical terms. Ma'am, you still have to pay 70,000 rupees. But I paid 70,000 yesterday. - Thank you. Look. - No, ma'am. Actually, they were room charges. Give that to uncle. Let's go see mom, huh! Vivek, sir. Did he pay the bill? - Yes, sir. Give him the slip. You can claim your wife's body by showing this slip. Okay? Body? Why are you saying that? Your wife passed away last night. Passed away? When? I was right here last night with my kid. Why didn't you tell me? She could've at least seen her mother one last time. In the morning you sent me to get money. And when I returned.. ...you made me stand in the payment queue. You didn't tell me she's dead. Look, my job is to keep an account of the money. Not the patient. And anyway, we disclose this information.. ...after all the bills are settled. Otherwise, people like you would leave.. ...without paying the Bills. What.. She was dead last night. And they didn't tell me she's dead. For the past one week.. ...I paid you every penny you asked for. Here. Take some more. Take all of it. Can you let my child see her mother one last time? Look, mister, this is a hospital. Please don't create a nuisance. Shut up! Those are the rules here. If you've got a problem.. ...then you can go to the government hospital next door. Rs. 12,000. I could've used this for shopping. I could've done many other things. Go ahead, I'll join you. Where are you going? - There's something I need to do. Take madam to Versova. Go on. Balram Nagpal. You're his wife, aren't you? Sign here. Sign here, aunty. Only then will you get his death certificate. Here. Fine. Give it. Give this at the cremation ground. Come on. He gambled away everything we had. How will I raise these two now? Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh Lord! The Lord doesn't do everything Himself. He leaves some things for devils like us. Doctor. Doctor. Please save him. He fell from the 3rd floor.. ...and he isn't speaking since then. Please save him at any cost. Nurse, take him to the emergency ward. And you, first pay the admission fee. Quickly. Don't worry about the money. I'll pay everything. Just save him at any cost. Don't worry, relax. Did your husband have insurance? - No. Come, let's get one now. He's dead. He's already dead, doctor. But they don't know this. He's alive until they have money in their pockets. Here's the bill. What is the patient's name? - Balram Nagpal. Start treatment. Begin. His condition's very serious. Get these medicines and injections.. ...from the pharmacy immediately. Quick, quick, quick. - Where's the pharmacy? On the right. Nurse, get me an oxygen cylinder right now. 7,300. Make the bill in the patient's name. - Yes. Balram Nagpal. - Okay. What took you so long? Don't you know it's an emergency? I didn't know my brother's in such a serious condition. Can I see him? Please do not disturb the doctor, okay. Go and sit there. Here, another lot. Go give it back to the chemist. Hey, take this. Maintain a proper record. You're always sore when it comes to commissions. I never lie, dear. Excuse me. Please come. - Yes. Look, his condition is getting worse. It's a hemorrhage. I think we need to call a neurosurgeon. You can call God if you want, just make him better. Are you sure? - Sure. His fee is 200,000! It's okay, I'll arrange for it. - Okay. Nurse, call Dr. Verma. Okay. Make the bill in the name of the patient, Balram Nagpal. Yes. Doctor.. The Specialist is here. We'll save him. Yes. What kind of people are they? They don't even spare the dead. Just wait and watch what they do next? You guys will get me in trouble someday. This body is starting to decompose. We can't keep up this act for too long. Sir..when he's willing to pay.. ...we'll milk him all we can, and take our share. Let's start with the charade before it's too late. This act will end soon. Do you know how to shoot a video with a phone? Yes. The doctor will come out any moment. Focus only on him. He'll come out with a long face. He'll say "I'm sorry, the patient is no more". "I wish you had informed me earlier." Excuse me. - Doctor. I am sorry, the patient is no more. I wish you had informed me earlier. Doctor, please try again. Try to understand, he's dead. Sir, you're a specialist. Please try once. What are you saying? How can he treat him? He's dead. Why? Can't the dead be treated? - What? Obviously. How can anyone treat the dead? Why not? This is Patil Hospital. The dead can be treated here. - Are you crazy? Who can treat the dead? - Why not? Am I crazy? Look. Read this. What's written on it? Read it. Municipal Hospital? Dr. Deshmukh certifies death at 11:25 am. Patient's name..Balram Nagpal. When the patient's already dead.. ...what were you all doing in there for 6 hours? This isn't just the patient's death certificate.. ...it's this hospital's death certificate. You people are an expert in conning the patients. Can I get a copy? How many do you want? What happened? Can't breathe? Should I call a specialist? This is your bill. Please pay 300,000 at the counter.. ...and collect the body. This body won't go anywhere. Until you don't make a cheque for 500 million rupees.. ...in the name of Shanti Nagpal. What? Your game is up. Call your boss. Come on. Call your boss. Come on, out. Out! Out! Good shot. Buy him out! How much is he asking for? He's a little cynical, sir. No one knows him. All he keeps saying is.. ...I want to see your MD. I'll talk to him about the money. Hello. Dad, there's..a small problem. You expect me to fly back from Dubai.. ...to solve your small problem? When will you ever grow up? It's your problem, you deal with it. Call him. So you want 500 million rupees.. ...in exchange of all the evidence. Cheque for 500 million, in the name of Shanti Nagpal. Wife of late Balram Nagpal. Rs. 4,60,475 which I spent, cash! Breaking your pride is much more fun.. ...than breaking bones. Better pay up quietly-- ...otherwise I'll get this place sealed up. Sir, this is a cheque for 500 million.. ...and the rest of the cash. Here. Your husband's insurance cheque. I know this cannot fill in the void. But it can make life a little easier. Take it. Thank you. My husband's death did.. ...what he couldn't do when he was alive. You are doctors. It's your duty to serve people, not con them. Shame on you all. I am sorry. I just hate sorry's. Shut it down! - Shut down Patil Hospital! Shut it down! - Shut down Patil Hospital! Sir, that guy double-crossed us. He took money from us.. ...and also gave the evidence to the media. Move away. You idiots. How the hell can they enter my property? I won't spare them. Sir..sir.. Get out from my property. Move. Just back off! Let's go home boss. Boss, the body.. I mean Vikas has been brought home. Let's go home. Please. - Shut up. You do know who I am. Patil. Digvijay Patil. I am a brand! I am a bloody brand! First he killed my son.. ...and also challenged my reputation. I want him. I will first kill him.. ...and then cremate my son's body. Sir, many have seen his face. But no one knows anything about him. So he just came and left after ruining everything. And you don't know anything. And that woman, who he gave the 500 million.. ...doesn't know him either. She was saying that.. ...she met her at the Municipal hospital. Sir..he must be on the hospital's CCTV camera. What's the connection between them? Relatives.. - What, sir? You see, whenever I need some expert advice.. ...I talk to myself. What's up, guys? - How are you all? Good! Good! Good! Are you all going for the college reunion? Yes. We're all meeting after three years. Everyone is busy with their jobs. We hardly see each other. - Wait. Yes. Anuj More. Wasim Sheikh.. No one's going to miss the college reunion. College connection. There are 48 cameras in 16 blocks of the hospital. I'm checking the tapes of all the blocks. Hurry UP- If my superiors find out.. ...I've been looking through personal files of government officers.. ...then I will definitely lose my job. But I will get promoted. Thank you. Check which college they all studied at? Arjun More, Sanghli. Wasim Sheikh, Nashik. Varsha Raje, Latur. Milind Sangvi, Dhule. Sir, he paid 4,60,000 at the cash counter. What time? At around 11:30am. So why are you showing us all this. Play the tape from 11 am, quickly. - Yes, sir. Find out the connection between them. Arun More, AV college.. Wasim Sheikh, MG college. Varsha Raje, Garge college. Milind Sangvi, Hindu college. They are all from different fields. What could be the common connection between them? This is their post-graduation. Search from where they did their graduation. You will get me into trouble.. Forget the job, come on. Fast-forward. Yes. That's the man, sir. Rewind! National College. National College. National College. National College. They all did their graduation from National College. All these honest people.. ...have branched out from this tree. And the root of this tree.. that Gabbar. Is from this National College. Zoom. Zoom in. Stop! This isn't possible. I killed this man five years ago with my own hands. Hey Sadhu, buddy. Welcome back.. - $0.. You know, since the day you left.. ...I had to put up with all that fritter and red sauce crap. You don't know. He'll soon apprehend Gabbar. He's got a solid lead. Congratulations. If I get another week's leave.. ...I'll bring Gabbar back on this scooter. Look, I've thought of a great plan to catch Gabbar. There's a honest officer in every office.. ...who gives information to Gabbar. Right? What.. Look..the senior's junior is the most brain at work. We're already across interval.. ...and they are still stuck here. They won't be able to figure it out even after the interval. And all the areas in between.. Welcome, Sadhu. Your presence has sanctified our Police Station. Long time no see. How are you? Sir, I was on a leave for few days. Did you go to the mountains? If you have finished meditating.. ...can we get some work done here? Sir, I need another five days leave. Thakur, Gabbar has been scing our department.. ...and Sadhu here needs another leave. Are you in your senses? Sir, I need leave to catch, Gabbar. - Shut up! Have you lost your mind? You're still hung over playing James Bond. You mean you did what we all couldn't do. You caught Gabbar. I haven't yet, sir. But I am very close. Hey..smarty.. You like playing catch, don't you? My wife's dog has been missing for three days. Go catch the dog and bring him back. Believe me, sir, I am very close. You're testing our patience. I'll transfer you to a place.. ...where you won't survive a single day. Out! Last time, sir. Out means get out! Yes, Yadav.. And Sadhu.. - I know, sir. Fritters and red sauce. Smart boy! You will definitely win today's fancy dress competition. It's a Maharashtrian wedding. Veena and Mark, inter-caste marriage. Did you know that according to Google.. ...16% of the marriages in India are inter-caste. You're absolutely right. Your marriage with Google was inter-caste as well. - Adi. Okay. Boss, there are 8 million voters in Mumbai. But Aditya's photo doesn't match with anyone. I don't care. I want him. Even my mom and dad had an inter-caste marriage. And their product is me, Shruti. And did you know that.. Sorry. Taxi. The venue's been decorated so beautifully, right? Yes. Just like when we were getting married. Here, 300 rupees. If I am late today, Veena's going to kill me. Listen, madam. Take your change. Wow! Since when did Mumbai's Taxi drivers give change? Since we don't have any extra expenses. No RTO guy imposes penalty. Nor does any constable ask for bribe. We don't have to pay for renewing our permit either. Corruption is dead thanks to Gabbar. No corruption means.. ...our hard-earned money is enough. Keep it. Thank you, sir. This is phenomenal. I think I am in love with Gabbar. Gabbar is a criminal. - Shut up. Sorry. Hi! - Sorry. "Keep dwelling in me." "Make your presence felt in every breath." "From dusk to dawn..you're only for me." "Without you..I've nothing." "We're separate but our soul's one." "Don't ever leave me and go away." "Our story..is like the drops of rain." "Let our story..pour down like love." "Our story..is like the drops of rain." "Let our story..pour down like love." 'Long live..' "Look at the blessings conferred on us." "We've found refuge in each other." "We've all the..necessities to live." "May everything..stay the way it is." "From dusk to dawn..you're only for me." "Without you..I've nothing." "We're separate but our souls are one." "Don't ever leave me and go away." "Our story..is like the drops of rain." "Let our story..pour down like love." "Keep dwelling in me." "Make your presence felt in every breath." "The only thing that happened between us." "it was love, love and only love." "We're so close, there's nothing missing." "May we live together..as long as we live." "From dusk to dawn..you're only for me." "Without you..I've nothing." "We're separate but our soul's one." "Don't ever leave me and go away." "Our story..is like the drops of rain." "Let our story..pour down like love." Someone please save me. Do something quickly. Adi. Adi. When old liquor and old memories get to your mind.. ...it makes a man out of control. But who is this guy who's getting so out of control? What enmity does he have with you? Even if the fire's extinguished.. ...there's a spark left somewhere.. ...which can turn into flames anytime. Remember our Andheri Building case. Which one? The one that collapsed five years ago? Yes, that one. His family was amongst the people that died. Some people get.. too serious about their family. Sir, 212 people died.. ...because of your building that collapsed in Andheri. And more than 100 people are in the hospital. And sir, there was a creek at first. On your advice, the Corporation filled up the creek.. ...and also passed the registration of that land. After conducting the soil test.. ...we knew that a building that high won't stand there for too long. But on your advice, we declared it as dry soil. Did you call me here to tell me all this? But sir, someone has to take responsibility.. ...for the inquiry which has been ordered. We bribed everyone to keep quiet. But I wonder where did this man get all the evidence? Who is that man? Call him. Sir, he's a little cynical. His wife was crushed under the debris of the building. Sir, his wife was pregnant too. Sir, I'll take care of all the legal formalities.. What's his name? - Aditya. So, Aditya. I heard you've been wielding that file.. ...as a weapon against me. Is that right? Hey Collector..how much did you get to pass the tender? Sir.. - Say it. This is not a sting operation. Sir..18 million. See..9 is his lucky number. And he takes only on a Tuesday. Hey..how much did you take for the registration? 8 million. How much did I pay for that soil test? Sir..3.5 million. You think they will lay a finger on me. Look, this inquiry isn't going to help you in anyway. The level we're at, we only hear requests from the common man. Not their voices. What's done is done. There's nothing we can do about it. Fine, I apologize. Forgive us. Collector, say sorry. Sorry. Not like that. Hold your ears and say it properly. Sorry, sir. - That's better. We're saying sorry and you're still staring at us. They all work for me, understand. You can never harm me. Digvijay Patil. This isn't just a name, it's a Brand. Brand! Let's do one thing. I'll give you two chances. You can call anyone in Maharashtra you like. Go ahead and complain. Do it. Do it. Don't be scared. Do you have a phone, or should I give you mine? Hello. Hello. Is this Commissioner's office? - Yes. Can I talk to the Commissioner? - Yes. One second please? Is the Commissioner on the line? Sir, the building which collapsed in Andheri.. ...killing 200 people..was Digvijay Patil's doing. Wrong number! Call again. Do it. Home Secretary. Hello. Hello, Mr. Pankaj Tiwari. Yes. Sir, the building which collapsed in Mumbai.. ...was Digvijay Patil's fault. I have all the evidence and files.. My number isn't public number. Everyone calls me. Change my number now. All lines in this route are busy. Please check the number you've dialed. This number does not exist. That's normal. I bribed everyone. Don't worry, I'll pay you too. Look, the Government is giving.. ...2.5 million to all those who died in that incident. You'll get 2.5 million too. But actually you should be getting 5 million. The Collector told me everything about your wife. So that 2.5 for the kid too, right? Forget the Government. I'll give you 10 million. Happy? Take the money. Get married again. Get a new wife. You're still young. So you can have kids again. Start a new life. Have fun. There's no point in doing all this. Take your money. Open the door. I beg you. Spare my life. Sorry! Sorry! Spare my life. I beg you. Please. I like those who don't like me. Such people have courage. Ballu. - Yes. Find out all the Aditya that were ever born in India. Yes. Alright. Breaking News! BMC attacked by Gabbar! Corrupt BMC officer hung to death. Hanging of IT officer creates havoc. Police to pay Gabbar's tax. This is Vijay Sabnis. There's a lot of property in his name. Ten in the name of his father. Five in the name of his uncle. And 15 in the name of Tipsy. Who is Tipsy? Wife? - Tipsy is his seven year old dog. I'm sure she eats gold biscuits, sir. What has the world come to, sir? People are doing illegal things.. ...in the name of the most loyal animal. Anil.. - Yes, sir. Slide up his name from no.6 to no.3. Yes, sir. Sir, he's got a bungalow near Pune worth 80 million. In the name of Tipsy. Slide him to no.2. - Yes, sir. Sir. Sir. Just got the news, sir. A CBI officer has been appointed by the Centre to apprehend Gabbar. Kuldeep Pawa. Very powerful. Gabbar! Question mark! Who is this Gabbar? He kidnapped a Collector in broad daylight. He killed him and hung him! And then what? A District Collector! BMC Officer! Income-Tax officer! So many Government officers.. ...were killed in broad daylight. Months passed away, and.. I don't have any reason to understand this. Sir! Sir, we tried hard. Gabbar is very smart. His network.. - What's your name? Sir? - Your name. Vishwas Sawant. - Mr. Sawant can you hear yourself? I mean can you really hear yourself. Because for me, it sounds like a common man's cribbing.. ...not a Police man's statement. Sorry, sir. You get promotion and medals only by working hard.. ...not by saying sorry. Sir, I need every single information about this guy. Every single detail we have. I need every data we have.. ...from a peon to officers. Right now. - Sir. That's it. What? I am back! Missed me? When 100 people get together and ruin your life.. ...that's called marriage. But when 10 million people together ruin a country.. ...that's a corrupt Government. Absolutely right. All the poor get is rebukes and stones. - Right. The currency notes only have Gandhiji's face, not his stick. That's why some people are spoilt. The list is ready. Let's see whose stars fall in a quandary this Friday. Now, sir. How do we find a clue from a CD? He openly threatened us. How do we arrest a voice, sir? We don't have enough Police force.. ...compared to the corrupt people in this city. And we don't know which department.. ...he will target this time. Sir, Gabbar's CD has terrorized the entire state. What is the Police doing about it? I want to assure everyone through you.. ...that the safety of the entire state is our responsibility. So don't worry. Next. Gabbar has struck twice. But the Police haven't done anything. Look, no one has to panic or be scared. He's taking his glasses off and wearing it back. They're reacting when it's time for action. And especially from a criminal that hides in shadows. He doesn't have the courage to show himself! So relax, okay. We have everything under control. One question please. - Listen sir. I want to assure you that.. ...the Police knows how to do their duty. And we are doing it. Yes. - Our department, sir. We just received news that.. "Gabbar has abducted Pune's ACP Shush Shinde. What? Bring sir back to the Police Station immediately. Many Gabbars came and went. Sir. - What? Sir, Gabbar is abducting police officers. What? Sir, we've received orders to bring you back.. ...to the Police Station immediately for your own safety. Sir, now who will protect you? Please come, sir. Everyone's requested, to please help the police.. ...so we can help you in return. Please pay attention. Hey..why isn't this working? You're on the top 10 list. Sir, Vasai's ACP More's been kidnapped too. Shit. Sir, Nagpur. Tawde has been kidnapped. That means..7 wickets down. Are you playing cricket here? Sir.. - He's bowling and we're batting. Idiot! Sir, three people are still left. We're in a race against him. Who's the most corrupt Police officer? I know everybody knows. Tell me so I can save him. Say it. Gawre sir. - Who? Chandrakant Gawre. Yes, it'll be done. Tell Jadhav I'm calling. - Yes, sir. Go on. - Chandrakant Gawre come in. Hey you.. - Yes sir. See that betel-leaf guy there. - Yes. Tell him to give my betel-leaf. - Yes. Come in. Come in. Chandrakant Gawre here. - Listen Chandrakant Gawre You could be the next target. Be alert. I am Chandrakant Gawre, sir! Death will have to come down personally to kill me. Chandrakant, be alert. I am getting backup force for you. Stay alert. Do you copy, Chandrakant? You don't worry. Copy!Copy! Don't waste my time. Just get here, come on. What's wrong? Get lost, come on. Sir, Chandrakant sir has been kidnapped. - What? Alert all check posts. Put up check posts everywhere. Every station. Don't let even a single car through. Search every car. Search every guy. Orders for every check post. Orders are from Kuldeep sir.. What in there? Grandpa, sir. Open it up. Hey..stop that black car. Don't let it through without checking. Stop him. What's going on here? - We're checking sir. You mean you haven't checked yet. I am doing it, sir. You know he's kidnapped an officer from our department. He could be in that too. What's in there? Mother? Father? - Grandpa. Grandpa? So why are you crying? It was his time to go. - Yes. Why are you being so emotional? How long has he been dead? - Two days. Two days? And you're still carrying the body around. Let it through. Come on, look there. And I want the report in every ten minutes. Come on. You fool..you don't know who you've abducted! I am Chandrakant Gawre! Police officer Chandrakant Gawre! Let me go. You will have to pay a big price. Yes, Govind. Let me go! - Where are you? Okay. Let me go. Leave me! Hold on. When will Govind get here? - He's on his way. What will you get by killing me? What will you get by killing me? You've kidnapped a Police officer. After I kill you.. ...your entire department will be purified. It's a proud moment for you. And for me, this is enough. Who are you? Ravi, take him inside. Come on. Come on. - You will pay for this. You will pay for this. Adi.. you kidnapped a police officer. What the hell are you doing? Kidnapping! Murder! What are you doing, Adi? Who are you? Gabbar! Gabbar? You.. Oh, my God.. How? "I didn't see, or think just lost my heart to you." Hey guys come here. Take him inside. Clean the blood. - Yes. Please do this. Those who saved my life, I thought I should do something for them. The youth has a simple strategy. If you like it, then welcome.. ...if you don't, then don't come. Patriotism boils in our blood. But only for IPL, ISL and Kabbir Leagues. Reality shows get more votes than in elections. Why? Swami Vivekananda had said.. "Give me 100 young men of heart and energy.." "..and I shall revolutionize the entire country." I brought this thought into action. After talking to them I realized.. Some have courage, but no power. Some have power, but no courage. And if they have both, there's corruption. The entire system has become a quagmire. Everyone knows that the situation is sad. Corruption is slowly turning into an addiction like anti-depressant. And then..slow death. We all decided. There's no point organizing candle rallies later. Right now..we'll have to ignite a fire in our heart. We taught good manners to animals. It's time to teach humanity to humans. Slowly we grew. Our team was ready. Just one goal. To spread the terror of Gabbar to an extent.. ...where these government officers.. ...will think twice even before taking their salary. I am the thread which we needed.. ...to bring these pearls together. Gabbar! Sir..Govind! Sir, we've done it. On Facebook, Twitter, News Channels.. The biggest villain has turned into the biggest hero. Gabbar is trending. No.1. The entire world is talking about him. And everyone wants to know. Everyone has the same question. Who is Gabbar? Isn't that great news? What happened? Isn't that great news? Why isn't anyone reacting? Govind. The list that we made for corrupt Police officers.. ...had your father's name on top. What do we do? What else, sir? Collector. District Collector. They had kids too, sir. One only sees their crimes, not their kin. Not Twitter or Facebook. You made me realize that my mission is a success. Sir. When people stand up.. ...against the crimes committed by their own kin.. ...then people like Gabbar are not required. This is the idea I wanted to get through. And I have succeeded. Good. But, sir.. Is my father here? I can't see him suffer. He might be bad.. ...but I am his good son. Am I, Adi sir? Gabbar! Gabbar! Gabbar! That's all everyone's talking about. And his voice! Every time I try to sleep.. ...his voice echoes in my ears. I want to know, am I the only one spending sleepless nights.. ...or does anyone here share the same empathy? Anyone. Sir, we're fighting this battle.. ...with only a scabbard, not a sword. Hey..shut up! Ignore him, sir. He's our local James Bond. Son..everyone loves his smartness and a better job. Mind your business. That's not all, sir. You should hear the main highlight. He thinks he has almost found Gabbar. And soon he'll catch him. Sir, you will never be able to catch Gabbar now. Hey smarty..shut up. Or else I'll fire you. - Get lost. Fire me? I'll resign myself. I resign. I don't want to work in an office.. ...that's filled with arrogant officers like you. Sadhu.. What, Sadhu? Sir, they think someone will serve them Gabbar on a plate. Gabbar is not an ordinary kidnapper, sir. He's on a mission. He's a mission himself. Don't forget you're a constable.. - Shut up! What else do you know about him? Look here, sir. A list of Nanded's Collector office. Excellent job, Sadhu. You've solved 90% of the case. By why didn't you tell anyone until now? Sir, I am just a driver. Then let's go for a drive, Sadhu. Sir, neither Police nor goons are allowed inside this gate. That's the rule of our National College. Is this some kind of a joke? Couldn't you vacate the college before I got here? Stop staring at me, get them out. Sir. Let it be. It will turn into a big student issue. The principal, teachers, students are crazy. Okay, we can't go in. But we can arrest those who are outside. Yes. Get your list. Arrest everyone. Yes, sir. Come here. What are you doing sir? - Come with us. Catch him. What are you doing? Leave me. - Come with us. Come with us. Sit in the car quietly. Now Patil's projects seem illegal because of Gabbar's terror. The entire real estate lobby is worried. Because of you all. If you like Gabbar's style, then so be it. Gabbar abducted 10 corrupt officers.. ...to get his message through. I abducted 10 honest officers. Which amongst you is the most honest officer? Come on. What is your name? -Sagar Pandit. Sagar Pandit. Are you abstinent against money? Doesn't your wife make demands? "I want this..l want that." Would you like a medal for your honesty? If you're of no use to me.. ...you're no good to this world either. If you accept bribe, Gabbar will kill you. And if you don't.. Great, officers. Now I don't even need to pay you for getting my job done. Just a little dose of fear is enough. We've been beating these guys since morning.. ...yet no one's ready to speak up. What am I going to tell the Home Ministry? Does anyone have an idea? How do we catch this Gabbar? Anything? Sawant? Bansal? Sir, may I? To catch Gabbar, we'll have to think like him. Sit. Yadav, shift. I said sit. Sit. Yes, sir. Yadav, order tea for everyone. Would you like one? - Yes, sir. Him too. What were you saying? Sir.. ...if I was Gabbar.. ...I would've gone after Digvijay Patil. Why? Two days ago he killed an honest officer Sagar Pandit.. ...because he refused to take bribe. But we don't have any proof. But, sir, everyone knows he's the one who did it. Right, sir. Digvijay Patil wants to maintain his fear amongst the people. But Gabbar will definitely punish him. We set out to eradicate bad people.. ...but evil just a bigger leap. Sagan" was one of the most honest officers... ...in his department, sir. Patil killed him very cruelly. Sir, should we arrest Digvijay Patil or give him protection? There's a thumb rule of hunting. Use the goat as bait.. ...as long as the lion doesn't come out. We just need to keep an eye on Patil. And Gabbar will be in our clutches. Patil has to die. The party's at his farm house.. ...and security is really tight. Sir, we have Digvijay Patil's schedule. Tomorrow is his birthday. It's not that easy to catch Patil, sir. Most of our team members are in police custody. That place will be crawling with his men and Police. Ministers, MPs, MLAs, Businessmen.. ...and other famous personalities will be present there. But we'll be waiting for just one man. Gabbar! Boss. We've the whereabouts.. ...of that rascal Aditya from the hospital. I'll bring you his severed head.. ...before you cut your birthday cake. Ballu, please bring him back alive. I will kill him myself. I will kill him again! "Come, sweetheart." "Come, sweetheart." "I don't know what you want." "Come, sweetheart." "Why do you make gestures and call me?" "Come, sweetheart." "Then why do you refuse when I come home." "Come, sweetheart." "Why do you climb up the roof and sing?" "Don't knock on the door, sweetheart." "Just come in, sweetheart." "Don't knock on the door, sweetheart." "Just come in, sweetheart." "Lay those flowers, sprinkle that perfume.." "..and get in the mood now, sweetheart." "Don't knock on the door, sweetheart." "Just come in, sweetheart." "Slowly, sweetheart." "Slowly, sweetheart." "Slowly.." "I'm your sweetheart, be my love." Hello. "Tonight I am going to rock your world." I've heard a lot about you. I hope you won't disappoint me. "I'm going to forsake all shame." "And make you my queen." "Tonight we're going to have some fun, baby..under the dim light." "Slowly, sweetheart." Boss. We're at Aditya's home. "Slowly, sweetheart." "Slowly, sweetheart." "Don't knock on the door, sweetheart." "Just come in, sweetheart." "Lay those flowers, sprinkle that perfume.." "..and get in the mood now, sweetheart." "Don't knock on the door, sweetheart." "Just come in, sweetheart." "Slowly, sweetheart." "Slowly, sweetheart." "Slowly, sweetheart." "Slowly.."
