I mean, that's cute. - You don't mind if I smoke, do you? - It's your house, man. No doubt. Why did you shoot the boy? I didn't shoot nobody, man. Come on, Curtis. A drug deal gone bad. Tempers get out of hand. Guns get fired. One of you accidentally shot the kid. The question is, which one? Why don't you figure out which one, then? Now you hang tight. I'll go do that. I don't know. Looks light, feels light. Got you both on drug charges. But there's a bigger picture here. Now, we'll drop the possession. Just tell me who shot the kid. What kid? Somebody shot a kid? Well, you see right there... that tells me it wasn't you. But that leaves only one other person. If I was you, I'd be looking to get out in front of this thing. You ain't me. You're fucked, you know that? You're cute and you're funny. You're a comedian. Welcome back, homey. Who you talking to? I ain't your fucking homey, homes. Now you listen, because I know the streets. Honor? I know all about it. I know you ain't no fucking snitch. But Razor tried to take your dope and kill you. Where is the honor in that? The way I see it... you don't owe him nothing, Curtis. Let me get this straight. You want me to write down on this piece of paper... that Razor tried to rob me for a bird... we got into a gunfight, and he shot the kid, right? Your own words. Let's see now: Possession. One with a gun will get you two. Complicity to murder. I mean, I just want to get this right so ain't no confusion. Take your time. I hear you. You hear it... Yeah, I'll get you a lawyer. You want a lawyer? You want to beat me down, don't you? What I want to do, and what is legal... are two different things. Get out of here. Have the members of the jury reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. - Will the defendants please rise? On the charge of possession of a controlled substance... with the intent to sell, what say you? We find the defendants guilty as charged. On the charge of murder in the second degree, what say you? We find the defendants not guilty. The defendants are remanded to the State of California immediately. Let's go! Come in here! Step it up! Step lively! On the line! Let's go! Face front! Face front! Let's go! Welcome to paradise, ladies. Let's go! Face me! Turn and face me! Get in here! On the line! My name is Capt. Pierce, and I like it. So don't call me Pierce... Cap, Hey you, Chief, or anything else. - Understand? - Yes, Capt. Pierce. Casaway Correctional Facility has rules... like the society you came from. Unlike the society you came from, there are no legal loopholes or shortcuts. So if you break them, you will be held accountable. This place runs on a ticket system. Tickets add time to your sentence. The more tickets, the more time. You keep your nose clean, do your job, keep a positive attitude... and you won't see any tickets. Do the opposite, and you will grow old and die in here. Here you go. Can I get you something to drink? No, I meant... Never mind. So how long are you going to do this, Michael? Do what? Not go to work, drink all day, sit around and feel sorry for yourself. - I wasn't Chase's mother, but I loved... - That's right! His mother died. You can't possibly know what I feel. Then have your son murdered... and the men responsible get five years. Eligible for parole in two... because the jury couldn't determine who was responsible. I won't stop it. You have got to move on. You know what? Maybe you ought to move on. I'm Linda Shepard. You'll call me Miss Shepard or ma'am. I'm your counselor. I see here you're responsible for the death of a 7-year-old. That wasn't me. - It wasn't you? - Didn't I say it wasn't me? Okay. Let's talk about what you were convicted of then. Possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell. Was that you? No, they got the wrong guy. So you are a political prisoner, like Tony Montana, then? You and the rest of the convicts in here? You're a real cold piece of work, Miss Shepard. A sexy woman like yourself in here with all these Mandingo warriors. Okay, we're done. The wet dreams you be having at night, you could fill a river. Get out. What's up with that, Rock? - What's your man tell you? - Are you getting out any time? - Looking good, Lt. Lodge. - Keep it orderly, Ron. All right, this one here. And you got a name? - They call me Clever. - So how's that working for you? - How's what working for me? - Being clever. Good. Because that's what I am. I'm Durty, bro. Durty Curt from Detroit. Your mother name you that? What you in for, Durty Curt from Detroit? I'm innocent, man. Yeah, right. Me, too. I got caught in a love triangle. I was messing around with this married man... one of my Latin students. His wife caught me teaching him a few new moves, and she goes off on me... and I smacked that bitch. He goes bananas, talking about don't hit the mother of his children... and starts beating on me like I'm one of his vatos. Suddenly there was this knife in my hand, and he kept falling on it... over and over... and over and over again. Let's get one thing straight, Clever. I ain't one of your dance students. And you're not looking to learn any new moves, right? Right. Why does every straight man think that every gay man wants to fuck him? You're not my type. Even if you were... I don't shit where I live. - Are we clear? - As ice-cold vodka, my nigger. That's for us. You're on kitchen detail. Hey, man, what you got? A new friend? Dirty Curt from Detroit. Dane and Kool. They say niggers from Detroit is hard. - True that. - Well, we hard, too. Any nigger take a dick in his ass, keep a smile on his face... is not to be fucked with. You understand? - I hear you talking, big man. - And that's real talk. All right, boys and girls. Cut the chatter and let's go to work. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. I love you. How you feeling? Golden, glowing, flowing like a champ. What does that mean? - That's how I kiss you when you're not here. - But I'm right here. Michael, you got a pimple. - What are you doing? - Come on, I'm saving your life. It's a pimple. You love me? You want me to confirm that I love you... because I wouldn't let you bust a pimple on my face? No. I want you to confirm that you love me because I'm pregnant. Oh, my God. I'm in love with the greatest woman on the planet. She's having my baby? Life is beautiful. You're beautiful. I love you. That's Monarch and his woods. They're like some pseudo Aryan nation, but you ain't got to worry about them. They're the minority up in here. That's your man Razor, the cat who took you off the street. How do you know? From County to State to Federal Pen, motherfuckers come and go daily. And they do talk. Faster than the Internet. You must know I'll have to bust Razor's ass before this is all over, right? Odds are four-to-one you lose. And how the fuck you figure? He's down with Gutter and Mathematic. Nothing happens in here without them sanctioning it first. The motherfuckers setting odds on this don't know shit. I set the odds. I run the book for the whole tier, and I ain't been wrong in five years. - That's 'cause you don't know Durty. - But I know Gutter and Mathematic. Gutter don't talk unless he's using his fist. And Mathematic, his name says it all. A calculating, cold-blooded killer. You may be dirty, but them niggers... are grimy. If they so grimy, how they got you on the books? They get 20%. But to answer your question, they'd have to fight me to take it away. And odds are they'd win. But there's a possibility that I could win, too. Now imagine that. You get your ass kicked by a faggot... where would that put them on the food chain in this piece? How's the coaching going, man? Not bad. We got a couple of promising Olympic contenders. There you go. Must have been pretty disappointing... not to be able to compete when you got out. Yeah, but I can't say I'm not happy coaching. - Can I ask you a personal question? - Sure. How do you survive it? - Survive what? - Prison. - You got to destroy the light. - What light? You gotta flip the cool light off, and turn the mean one on. You gotta not give a fuck if you live or die. Where nothing means nothing. The cool light off. The mean light on. One more time. Have any of you little girls seen Jimmy the Runt? Little girls? that only 5% of all people knows and teaches the truth. And 10% conspires to hide it. No, that ain't the truth. The truth is black people were the original people on this planet. Right. Just look at civilization. We're the mother and father to that. What happened was a scientist came along... and created the white man from the black man... and in turn, tricked the black man into slavery. - I don't believe that. - That's what happened. I'm a Christian man. I mean, I believe in Jesus. I don't think that's what it was. It is. And y'all need to just marinate on that a little bit while I go take this piss. He don't get it. You got to learn your daily mathematics. That's the truth. Your move. I'm Durty, man. Durty Curt from Detroit. Good for Detroit. We're playing a game here. I'm talking to you or this fat bastard over here? - Look, motherfucker... - It's cool. He can speak to me. So anyway, your man, Raymond Carver, Razor? - We got a little problem, man. - No, you don't. We had some business in the street, all right? The nigger reneged and tried to rob me. I know he mentioned it. I don't know what you're talking about, Durty, or whatever your name is. Somebody cheat you out of something... file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I come to politic some business, and you're sitting here playing games? No, you came to see if I'd flip if you touched Razor. Razor's a punk bitch, no argument. But he work for me. And he'll keep on working for me without drama until I say otherwise. There's your answer. You got a problem with that, you got a real problem, son. No, ain't no problem. No problem at all, bro. What, did I miss something? What the fuck you do that for? That's to let you know, the end you kick back to me just went up 10%. You gonna move, nigger? You take care of me, I take care of you, all right? I don't want the nigger in my house. Nigger, I know you laying up in my shit with my bitch. Put that on Razor. Your man Durty ain't gonna see the week out. There's a $50 cash limit, Smalls. You want to do more, it's got to be in trade. Not for Mathematic. He says you take all he bet. You got a problem with that, go see him. No. - It's all good in the hood. - Cool. Put me down for $20 on Razor, also. - Cash or trade? - Trade. You got any money on your books? $200. Why? I'm going to give you a list. When you go to the prison store, you'll use that $200 to buy what's on that list. What the fuck am I gonna do that for? - Don't watch. - I'm not, Clever. I can't go when you watch. It's what your insurance policy costs, and I'm the broker. Everybody's betting against you. If you make it through the week, I clean up. That's good for self, but what's in it for me? You get to live, plus 10%. And if you don't... it won't fucking matter. Make a deal with Pierce, and it's on. You want something, Craig? Clever say you're the man to talk to. Clever talk a lot of shit. Don't mean it's all true. If a man's got a problem with an inmate and wants to resolve it, what he do? According to your file, you promoted concerts, right? You want a stadium to hold a concert, how do you get it? I rent it. - How much, man? - $10,000. $5,000, up front. $5,000, after. Damn, you got to pay to play? Way of the world. Why should in here be any different, right? Are you aware you were straddling two lanes back there, sir? I was? Have you been drinking, sir? Drinking? Step out of the car, sir. Don't move, motherfucker! This is what it takes? Get down! Get your ass down! This shit ain't right, Curtis. Your daughter has needs. I got needs, and your responsibilities ain't being met. Rayvon, didn't I tell you I was going to take care of it? For Christ's sake, I'm locked the fuck up. And whose fault is that? It damn sure ain't mine. And don't try to act like you ain't got no money. - Mommy, can I have a soda? - Yeah, baby. - Here you go. Give Mommy a kiss. - Thank you. When did you ever hear me say I ain't got no money? I said Amber would take care of you after the concert. That's what I'm talking about. How you gonna let that off-brand bitch run shit? That's why your stupid ass is sitting where you sitting. What does Amber got to do with me being locked up? You hang out with stupid white bitches, you start doing stupid-ass shit, that's how. You gonna make me smack the shit out of you. I wish you would. Then they can just add some more time to the time you already got. Let me spend the last couple minutes I got left with my daughter. All right. Go on, baby. That's your daddy, an example of what not to grow up and be. - Raise your arms. - I'm here to see Capt. Pierce. - You here to see Curtis Craig? - Yes, sir. I need to have a word with you, ma'am. I got this, Lodge. Raise your arms. And your mama been calling, talking about she want to see Tori. - Take her to see her, then. - She got a car. Why can't she come see her? Like I got extra gas and money to be driving to her place. - You know what? - What? Take the picture, man. I got to go. My time is up. Coming to see me next week? I don't know. I'll think about it. Come on, baby. Come here, y'all are coming back. All right. - Rayvon. - Hey, Amber. - What the fuck is she doing here? - How am I supposed to see my daughter? Tell her to buy a digital camera and send the pictures. Don't even start with your shit, all right? Nigger get locked up and everybody got a little extra lip on their ass. Let me tell you something. I won't be in here forever, remember that. So what's up? You saw the man on your way in? - Just like you said. - You gave it to him, right? Yeah, but that $5,000 will cut into the radio spots we're to buy. Let me worry about that. You make sure that money get in the bank. - Give him the other half after the concert. - Okay. Me and you been through a lot together. I mean, nigger been there for you. When you had nowhere to go, who took you in? - You did. - I did, so act like it. What the fuck is going on? Hey, cops! What the fuck! You beat him long enough, he's gonna confess to being you. - He already confessed. - What? That was for Teal. Busted his kneecaps. He'll be lucky to ever walk again. Fucked me up. Fine. Have fun. Where's your fucking loyalty, Wade? When Durty Curt hit the yard tomorrow... I want you to shove that shiv up his punk ass. Yeah, for sure. I got that. No doubt. Gutter, Mathematic, Capt. Pierce wants to see you. Soon as we done in here. That wasn't no goddamn request. Get a move on. You trying to rob me, nigger? Gonna fucking kill me? No way I'm going for this! You die, motherfucker. You die, bitch. What? I can't hear you. Your bro Mathematic bet on the wrong man. Game over. We're trying to figure out what happened here. If you saw anything that might help us clear this up... it might take some time off your sentence. Aren't you just the Angie Dickinson reincarnated. Alas, my dear, we live in a world ruined by senseless brutality... fueled by cowboy politics and violent music videos. Yet we wonder why life still smells like poo-poo. What is that supposed to mean? I didn't see shit, I don't know shit, and I don't give a shit. Get the hell out. - So, where were you? - You know where I was at. Refresh my memory. I was in here talking with you about some bullshit. So you didn't do it? Did you? I walked in and there he was, you know? - No, I don't know. Why don't you tell me? - The nigger was dead. There was blood all over the place. Looked like a fucking butcher shop. - That's when I called the guards. - Then you didn't do it? I got nothing against niggers. I think everybody should own at least one. But to answer your question, no. You and Raymond Carver had a beef, right? I ain't had no love for the man, if that's what you mean. - Where were you? - In my cell. - You sure about that? - Ask Clever. He'll tell you. Thank you. You in prison, I'm not. There was a concert last night. Sold out. The promoter probably made a nice piece of change. You know that. Give it up, Smalls. You should've known better than to bet against Clever. That's right. Aren't you missing something? Fat ass. Shit's coming together like butt cheeks. I made a gang of loot, your man is gone, and you got away with it. - Now, that's ice. - Old Razor had it coming to him. You would know that if you spent a day in the street. No doubt. But Mathematic might feel the same about you. - We took him good. - I don't give a fuck what them niggers think. I done gave the man the other $5,000. Amber's gonna bring that paper today. I give Pierce that loot, and after that it's gonna be all good. I hear you talking. I'm just trying to figure out how low a chick's self-esteem have to be... - to date a nigger locked up. - She ain't no soccer mom. But in case you haven't noticed, there's a shortage on good men. But couldn't she date the mailman... the guy that washes her car, packs her groceries? - They ain't no good men, Clever. - They good enough to be free. Look, I ain't shitting on your game... but does a broad really think she can find a good man in jail? He's locked up. There's something ain't good about him. All right, girls, let's break it up. Craig, you got a visitor. What the fuck you doing here? Didn't your punk ass tell me to come visit you? You get the fuck up out of here with that bullshit. Why? 'Cause your white girl coming to see you? You ain't got nothing to say now? I got news for you. She ain't coming. - Rayvon, what is you talking about? - I want talk about Amber. You know, your blue-eyed wonder, the one you let run shit? Well, she ran the fuck off with your money. You told me to meet her after the concert to get some money for Tori... - and the bitch was gone. - She probably went to the store. Okay, not only was she gone... but your apartment was empty and all your furniture was gone. The landlord said that bitch moved out. They say it's better to be pissed off than pissed on. Well, I'm pissed off. So you're getting pissed on. What's going on? Ain't nothing going on. You know that chocolate milk run right through a nigger. - Just came here to take care of business. - Did you take care of it? - What? - Your business. Lt. Lodge, please escort these gentlemen back to their cells. - All right, you heard the man. Move out! - Let's go. - Quickly! - Keep your eyes front and move! - Your package didn't come. - Fucking cracker bitch double-crossed me. Took my paper, fled. So what that make me now, the walking dead? Won't be the first time a woman done crossed a man, did a man wrong. Most of the brothers up in here because of a woman. - So you understand my situation? - I understand you got a problem. So I'll keep on having this problem until I come with the rest of your money? I'm not as corrupt as you might want to believe. You and Razor were gonna get at each other one way or the other. I just got paid in the process. I got a new hearing aid. That's all good for you, but where that leave me? I'm not gonna make nothing happen, if that's what you be thinking. So in other words, I'm on my own? That's my man. You think that little move with your man was clever? What's wrong with you? Think because you got a new boyfriend you can take my money? I run you. You do what I say! I'll pimp your faggot ass... have motherfuckers gang-rape you till your asshole bleed red. You got me, you fucking queer? This is Eddie Mathematic, motherfucker. And I own you, bitch! Flip this motherfucker over. - Come on. - Let's fuck his ass. I can't believe I broke my heel. Jesus. - You'll call me "Miss Shepard" or "ma'am." - Yes, ma'am. Close the door. Are you aware Curtis Craig is incarcerated here? No, ma'am. I wasn't aware... that Curtis Craig and Raymond Carver were in prison here. Well, Raymond Carver isn't. He's dead. While you may not have been aware Curtis Craig is incarcerated here... we certainly are. And you will be transferred, the first opening we get, at another facility. Look, I have a son of my own. So I understand your pain, I do. If there is anything you need, let me know. I'll see what I can do to help. There's one thing, ma'am. When I was in County, I got into art. Ceramics and that sort of thing. - And you'd like to continue it here? - Yes. - I'll see what I can do. - Thank you. Jesus, what the fuck, man! I'm straight, man. On what planet? Demerol. It's Mathematic and Gutter. Figured out Clever helped you get to Razor, didn't like the loss. So they took the book. They're probably coming after you next. They came after me first. I'd be laying right here next to him or worse if Pierce hadn't come through. So Pierce has got your back? Amber ain't never come through with the paper. So if it's gonna happen, it's gonna have to happen, right? You guys have to leave now. What's up? You waiting for me to do something? - Ask you to dance? - You tell me. Look, man, I got this appeal going for me, and I don't need nobody fucking it up. So don't start no shit, won't be no shit. Toure Smalls. - Folks call me Smalls. - Right, Smalls. Can you tell me what this says? I got a reading disability. - What kind? - The type where I can't read. What are the glasses for? - Makes me look smart. - Right. All right, let me see. It says your appeal's been filed... and a judge is reviewing it. - That's it? - Yeah. I just got married before I caught this case. Locked up six months later. I wouldn't be up in here if I had a real lawyer. Punk-ass public defenders. Anybody knows anything with the word "public" in it ain't worth shit: Public bathrooms, public schools, public housing. You know who becomes public defenders? Motherfuckers who get D's and F's in law school. I had a better chance of getting that bald, black brother on The Practice. And he ain't even a real lawyer. Eddie Mathematic want to see you. - Who? - Eddie Mathematic, he's the man. Nothing go down up in here without him touching it. So he want to see me. Why? I win a contest or something? Shit, you're like a celebrity. Killed a cop. Look, I did not kill anybody. You tried. That's good enough for him. Come on. Fuck. Jesus. All right, just be cool, all right? Don't speak until he talks to you, it's cool. Hey, what's up, y'all? This the guy? The one that had the thing with the cop? - This is the guy. - C., watch out. Have a seat, brother. - I'm Mathematic. How you? - Michael. We good people. I wanted to meet you, make sure you settled in right. Nothing personal... but if I wanted to meet good people, I wouldn't be in here. You want to make your time in here easy? Get with us. We'll get you a hustle, anything you need. I'd be your daddy. You'd be one of my sons. Make your six months feel like a vacation. - Your son? - Yeah. I don't know, man. What do you mean, "I don't know"? I get with you, and all of a sudden... my six months turn into a lifetime subscription. So what do you think? You think you gonna just waltz up in here... do Durty Curt, and waltz out when your bid is up? Ain't gonna happen. We got plans for Durty, and it ain't nothing nice. Well, you know what they say: If you want to hear God laugh... tell him what you got planned. God don't run this motherfucker. I do. Let me think about it. I'll get back to you. Your boy don't understand the rules in here. Let me talk to him, all right? He ain't quite figured it all out yet. All right, you go handle that. - Antonio, I'm so glad you could make it. - I came here as soon as I could. I was just making David a snack. Got some taquitos. Are you hungry? No, I'm good. - Can I see him? - Sure, give me a minute. You can come on back. Here, I'll take your jacket. He's looking forward to seeing you. Hey, Wade. Sit down, man. Check this out. I couldn't watch cartoons when I was kid because we couldn't afford a TV. - I love them cartoons. - You don't mind me smoking? I'm sorry, but this location must remain secret. Dave, how you doing? You know me, Wade. I'm doing good, man. I'm a grown man and I got diapers. That way, when I shit in my pants, my wife can change me. Takes a lot of love and loyalty for a woman to do that. Especially for a man who can't even fuck her no more, you know what I'm saying? She's strong, though. She's a hell of a woman. Did you stop seeing your psychiatrist? This is my psychiatrist. Every day I take her out, I put her in my mouth. You know why I don't pull the trigger? 'Cause I'd rather use it on the motherfucker who put me in this chair. - Man, you can't talk like that. - What am I supposed to say? I read the Bible, bro. You know what Matthew says in Chapter 5, Verse 38? "An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth." Mano para mano. That guy took my life, Wade. He deserves a bullet between his eyes. You and I both know that. - Let me take the gun. - Get the fuck out of here! All right. All right, inside. Goodnight, cocksuckers. What up, man? You Curtis Craig? They call me Durty Curt. Durty Curt from Detroit. - Who are you? - Michael. People call me Mike. So what up, Mike? You want something? This guy, Razor, somebody did him in here. Yeah, I might've heard a little something about that. It just reminded me of when my son was murdered. You got kids? - Yeah, man. A daughter. - So you know what I'm talking about. - Somebody shot my son. - Look, it wasn't me, all right? Nobody said it was. Don't play with me, son. I'm who you think I am, you heard? I'm telling you right now, I ain't killed your son. But if by chance I did have something to do with it, I'm sorry. - Lf there was something I could do... - Shoot yourself in the eye! Then you'll know exactly what my son experienced... - right before he died. - So it's like that? Would make us about even. But I didn't kill your son. My nigger, don't make me kill you. Is there a problem? No, Officer, no problem. No, everything's great. So, listen, I talked to my people. And if that bitch shows one hair of her pale ass on the street... she's over with. - You'd do that for me? - I ain't doing this shit for you. I'm doing it for Tori. We need that money. Thanks, anyway. I know we ain't been kicking it the way you thought we ought to... but I'll change all that when I get out of here. - Okay, what you want? - Why I gotta want something? 'Cause you always start with that "I'm gonna change" shit... when you want something. Then when I do it... your ass ain't nowhere to be found, changed or otherwise. All right, fuck it then. I ain't gonna try to play you. - You too bright for that. - I know that's right. This is the deal. I need you to see this man outside. He gonna give you a package to bring up in here... Hold up, you want me to smuggle drugs up in here? Say it louder. The guard ain't hear you. - What the fuck for? - 'Cause if you don't, I'm a dead man. And a live baby daddy in jail is better than no daddy at all. You know what? This is some crazy shit. You got the white girl running shit when everything is going cool. But when shit gets fucked up, you want to run to the sister. "Hold me down, watch my back." Risk going to jail? But through all the bullshit you put me through... I still got faith in your black ass. So you gonna do it then? Yeah. Fuck me, man. Hell, nigger, whose dick you suck to get all this shit here? I asked Miss Shepard. What the hell did you say? We have a bond, all right? Speaking of bonds, Mathematic want to know what you gonna do. - What did you say? - I told him you were thinking about it. - I'm not. - Yeah, but he don't know that. How long before you think he figures out you're jerking him off? Man, my appeal goes through, it won't even matter. It'll be somebody else's problem. - And if it doesn't? - We'll deal with it when we get to it. But in the meantime between time, can you read this letter? Mitchell, you've got a visitor. Mathematic, I need to holler at you, man. What went down between me and Razor, that's between us. I know he was making you money... so I got a connect gonna bring some product up in here. So 50% of the profit is yours, if it'll make things right between us. You take the castle with your knight, man. I'm trying to make some peace up in here. You heard me? Nigger, is you crazy? Dead men don't talk. Ladies. All right, motherfucker. Remember though, to kick some ass, you got to bring some. Bitch me, you nigger. How you doing? You're asking me how I'm doing? You're one of the smartest brothers I know. I made a mistake. I'm doing my bit. You don't end up in a place like this by accident. - You brought the boots I wanted? - Yeah. Robin's been asking about you. - She wants to come to see you. - Not an option. What you mean, that's not an option? The woman loves you. I'm sorry she feels that way, okay? And it must hurt like hell, but I can't love her. My wife won't allow it. Let him by. You're gonna kick down 25% of your profit if we take out Mathematics. What, you scared? I'll give you 35%. "Scared?" We ain't scared, man. There's nothing we enjoy more than killing niggers. So what's up, man? We got a deal or what? No. Why should I risk one of my guys... when all I gotta do is just kick back and watch you niggers kill each other off? No risk to us. That shit's better than watching cable. What the fuck you doing in here, man? I know the game, nigger. Down one, drown one. Courtesy flush. Besides... it's too small in here to let it float, anyway. Welcome back, my nigger. Welcome home, boy. - You think you can help me out here? - I'm busy. I got a real problem, Mike, all right? Now that Clever's out, Mathematic put me on the book. He doesn't know you can't read? I don't know what we owe or who owes what. Look, I got your back. I been watching your back, right? - All I ask is that you help me out with this. - Let me see that. They're shitting you, you see? That's the first thing the police tell you: You have the right to remain silent. That is the first thing a nigger give up. See, we can't hold nothing back. The only thing white folks say is, "Can I call my lawyer?" End of conversation. Unless you a celebrity. They treat them motherfuckers totally different. They call them up like, "Hi, this is the Chief of Police. "I know you're busy, I've seen your motion pictures... "but if it's not too much trouble can you stop by the station... "say on Tuesday, so we can arrest your motherfucking ass?" Yeah, and then they be arrogant with their shit. They like: "Does it have to be Tuesday?" See, Snoop Dogg, he ain't gonna get that call. They gonna have helicopters, SWAT unit kicking his door in... while he on the toilet trying to take a shit... and put him in the car before he can wipe his ass. If you could fuck anybody, who would you fuck? Man, I got 10 years. So, yeah, I'm prison-gay. But it ain't about the sex. It's about the power. And the look on that fool's face when you running up in him. Yeah, we know all that. Now, who would you fuck? Mike Tyson. Take his manhood, and I'm the champ. All right, what about you, Clever? - POTUS. - Who? - POTUS? - The President of the United States. Figure he been fucking the shit out of America... it only seems appropriate he gets a taste of his own medicine. Grudge fuck. You got to tame the beast before you make him a house pet. All right, ladies, you've had your fun. The party's over. - All right, we'll see you. - Come on. Please put your seats in their full and upright position... because tomorrow, it's gonna get ugly. Two of them chocolate milks. What's up? Been waiting to hear back. - He's in. - Is that a fact? He helped me with the books last night. Ain't that right, Mike? That's cool. You help Smalls with the books. But I think you need a hustle of your own. Getting kind of cozy with that Counselor Shepard. Got you a bunch of art supplies and shit. I'm thinking, we see what else she could get for you. Yeah. That's a good idea, Mathematic. Nigger, shut the fuck up. I'm talking to this man. I want you to get a cell phone. $50 dollars a call. Clear $500 to $600 a day. $20,000 a month. You make a third. You are fucking dreaming. Wake up. Who the fuck do you think you talking to? This nigger? Nigger, that's my nigger. If I want him to, he'll break your little fucking pretty ass up. You think you can tell me no? I run this motherfucker. I tell... We've just lost cabin pressure. No! A faggot killed you, motherfucker! We've got a situation here! Stay down, motherfucker, god damn it! Revenge don't mean shit... unless the motherfucker you're doing knows it's you. God! All available guards to the cafeteria! Stay down! Fuck off, man. Get the fuck off of me! Fucking motherfuckers, man! Suck my dick, bitch! Fuck you, bitch! Fuck all of y'all, man! Once upon a time, long ago... there was a bird. A big black bird from Detroit. And one day, he went soaring through the sky. He tried to land on this telephone wire. But when he came down for his landing... he kind of missed a step and he fell off. He lost his balance. Why did he fall, Daddy? - He lost his balance, baby. - Why? I don't know. Happens to everybody. Like when you was first starting to walk... when you first learned how to ride a bike, you had to find your balance, remember? I get it. Like when Mama talks about you. What? She says you can't balance us with the streets. - She said that? - That's what Mama said. What is it? Come on. Okay, relax. I'm gonna give you a hint. What do you want to be when you grow up? Daddy. - Okay, give it to him, Daddy. - All right. Here we go. Just what I wanted! - Do you like it? - Let me get y'all. Look through here. Put it to your eye. There you go. - All right, did you press... - Lights, camera, action! Bounce. Someone's good. Takes out a defender. Going up. Jumps! It's in! Yeah! Crowd going apeshit! Women throwing themselves at him. What's up, baby? See you at the bar? - Yeah, to the ticker-tape parade. - Fine black nigger. Comes off the podium. He walks into the sunset. And he's met by two police officers... who arrest him for cheating on his wife. For fucking a white woman. What've we got here? One, two... - There's three there. - Three kilos. You know this puts you in the business of distribution, Chris? I got a problem. I'm trying to see if I get help... I'm trying to talk, then you can talk. If you can convince me that you're just a consumer... you'll do seven months, tops. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I'm a consumer. I love the shit. I'll do whatever you guys want me to do. I don't like cops, sorry. I'm nervous. You can fuck me if you want, dude. It's been three weeks and we've interviewed everyone... including our own people. About 80% said they don't know what happened. and Gutter did it. Convenient how all the cons responsible are dead. - Which means nobody catches a case. - Yeah. Not to mention, the cons that informed on the dead... want all the prison details and the stuff that we promised them. - Same shit, different bowl. - Yeah. What do you want to do about Mitchell and Craig? We can't keep them in segregation if we can't charge them. - Return them to general population. - All right. What you doing tonight? Well, if I can get a babysitter, I'm gonna meet with this mortgage guy... and talk about getting a second on my condo. What about you? My ex got a plumbing problem she wants me to take a look at. A little sex with the ex. Good for you. I don't give a fuck what he said. Don't ever bring me back a book that's short! I want it to ring out loud and clear for this motherfucker! Smalls don't be taking no shit! - Hey, Mike, what's up? They let you out? - Yeah, just now. What the fuck y'all still doing in here? Get the fuck out! Hurry up, man. They took all your shit, man. Doesn't matter anymore. What was that all about? I had Shepard read this to me. They denied your appeal. But with Mathematic gone, I got the gambling, I got the dope. I got the whole barnyard, man. I got room up in here if you want some of this action. You think my position changed 'cause it's you? You ain't no different than any nigger up in this piece. You've committed blood crimes without prejudice or remorse. Once you've lost everything, you're free to do anything, nigger. Yeah, that philosophical shit is all cool. But what this shit is really about, is revenge. This from a man who can't read or write. Well, some things ain't written on paper. But I do know, for every number one... there's a number two waiting to make his move. And that's how you get back at Durty Curt from Detroit. - Are you here to see Michael Mitchell? - Yes, ma'am. I need to have a word with you, ma'am. - You saw the man outside? - Yeah, I brought it, but... - I know, I was in segregation. - No shit. You know you could've called me. Rayvon, I was in segregation. So? Would it have killed you to make one damn phone call? And I wasted a whole tank of gas coming all the way up here. - The word "segregation" means "solitary." - What? Don't worry about it. Forget it, all right? I'm sorry. It's my bad. I should've called. So what's up? You got that? Yeah, it's at the house. You want me to bring it tomorrow? No. But you told me to... I know what I told you to do, but I'm sorry. It's for your own good. See, this is one of your tricks. You're saying it's for my own good, but it's... Come on, Rayvon. Just stop, all right? Please, just stop. I know I can't blame you, honey. Ain't like I been the most trustworthy motherfucker on the planet. But this right here is about our daughter. Think about what's gonna happen to her... if you get caught bringing that shit up in here. What I did, I did. I'm in here. But I'll be damned if I'm gonna take you down the hole with me. I need you to go to my mom's house and get some insurance papers. In case some shit go down in here, you and Tori will be all right. Hey, baby, ain't nothing gonna happen to you. You are a strong black man. - You know I love you, Rayvon. - I love you, too. - How you doing? - That's my question, isn't it? How I'm doing isn't really much of a question. It is to me. - Did you see the lady? - Yeah. But it doesn't matter. I'm just glad you called. Armand told me you wanted to see me. - Don't think I don't love you, all right? - I know you love me. I can feel it in my heart. The problem is that you can't stop loving your wife and your son. I'm a good woman, but I can't compete with the memory of them. You shouldn't have to. - Are you seeing someone? - Yeah, I guess. I mean... - He's a good man and he loves me, but... - But what? He can't compete with the memory of you. They say time heals all wounds. I know it's a clich. But it's gotta come from somewhere. Look, in time, you'll forget about me. Tell me something, Michael. How come time hasn't healed your wounds? I gotta go. It's time to get up. What the fuck, man. - Chow line's not for another hour... - Get your sorry ass up! You be where I tell you to be and when I tell you to be there. - Capt. Pierce know about this, ma'am? - Capt. Pierce is off. Don't make me get ugly up in here. Get your ass up! Now! Come on, you can move faster than that. I gotta tie my shoe. Get your ass in there. Turn around. - I didn't kill your son. - Turn around. Whatever you got to do, just do it, 'cause I ain't helping you. Turn the fuck around! What the fuck you want, man? Come on. It's over, man. Come on, Mike. This is for Officer Teal. Mike. Hold on, man. - Why? - I don't know. Hold on. Hold on, please. There's nothing left to do. I forgive you. Hold on, Mike. Guards! Somebody help me! I need help! Help! You know, life is funny, Mike. This happens, that happens. All of a sudden, you find yourself in this life you never thought you'd have, you know? You never planned for it. Shit is just there. And the life you thought you'd have... that shit seems so far out of grasp, you'd do anything to get it. But my word to God, man, I wish none of this never happened. Call me crazy... but it's like you're where you want to be. And I'm where I need to be.
