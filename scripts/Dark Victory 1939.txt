We had a party last night and the last guest hasn't driven out of the driveway. Take it. Take it. Hello? Kitchen. - Lucy speaking. Yes, Miss Ann. - Yes, I know. I know. What's that racket? The telephone's been ringing all over the house. I'll talk to him. Michael, what do you mean at this unholy hour of the morning? Well, good morning, Miss Ann. Cheerful morning, isn't it? I was wondering if I might talk to Miss Judith. No, you certainly might not. She hasn't had two hours' sleep yet. I wouldn't disturb her for the world. This is Miss Judith Traherne of the sleepy Trahernes. Is it, now? Well, this is Mr. Michael O'Leary of the wide-awake O'Learys. You have a cash customer for the colt. We can get 10,000 if you're quick. If you mean Challenger, not 10 and not 20. My head's just woozy, not vacant. If you don't mind my saying so, Miss Judith... it's better if you take charge of the ribbons... and leave the handling of the horses to me. I do mind your saying so. I gave you your orders last night, Michael. I ought to slap that man's face. He's impertinent sometimes, but what can we do? He's about the best trainer money can buy. - I suppose he is. What time is it? - About 5:30. Good morning, Martha. Hello, Daffy, come on. - We're going to the stable, Martha. - Are we? Couldn't you go back to bed and get a little sleep? - Will you get us some coffee, Martha? - Yes, miss. Well... here we go. Come. - You asleep? - It's a nice world if we can stay in it. - What do you mean? - Better let me drive. - No! - Give me that. I will not. Good morning, ladies. - Oh, I managed to get you up, did I? - Don't be fresh. I hear you've got the finest horses in the country. Least you could do is let them have a look at you. Surely if the horses can get up early to run and jump... you can get up to watch them. Michael, really! - Hello, Judith. - Hello! - Hello, Jones! - We're gonna be killed someday. - Ann, come here. - Thanks for the lift. Take it away, Bob. - I wouldn't stand for it. - I won't. - He's got to be fired. Right now. - He's going to be. Thinks he can lead us around like horses. Ann, fire him. Me? I'm not the mistress here, I'm only the secretary. But, darling, you have the character. You're always telling me so yourself. - Judy! - Hello, everybody. Good morning, Alec! - Oh, what a party. - Glad to see you're still on it. All ready for tonight. All I gotta do is change the orchid. - Good morning, Ann. Nice, sensible Ann. - Good morning, parasite. Why not go to bed before they put you there for good? Well, now, confidentially, it's a scheme. Your man Michael told me he'd give me a nice fat commission... if I can get our sweet Carrie to buy your colt, Challenger. - Michael? - And I can use the cash. - This is the end! - Judy, darling. I will take that colt off your hands if you'll let me have a bargain. I won't sell the horse, but I'll sell his trainer. That's who she really wants to buy, but he won't even look at her. - I've never heard of such a thing! - Judith... - ...do you want to sell that colt? - No, I do not! Colonel, dear. I think you ought to buy him, colonel. He's a perfect darling. You can even invite him for tea. He could play on your front lawn with your children and your dogs. He's a love. He whinnies. Unfortunately, a steeplechaser has to have more than just a pretty smile. Colonel Mantle, my father held that foal up in his arms and said: "Judy, here's a champion. By Victory..." "Out of Field Nurse by Man O' War. Let's call him Challenger." Catch that horse at the two-mile pole... with his heart bursting and he'll fold up on you. Michael, you might fold up, and I might fold up... but that horse has the breeding. That was for me, I take it. I told you I wanted to run him. Where is he? - He's in his stall having his morning tea. - Well, go bring him up here. When I tell you to do something, do it. Yes, mum. That head again? It comes and goes. - I'll show him if that horse has courage. - What are you going to do? Michael... how long have I had you? - One month and three days. - Remind me to think about firing you. I don't think you'll be firing me. We're going to get on together. Just because I called your little darling a coward... Someday, you'll learn that courage is in the blood. Now, take your little horse and run along. Good riding, Judy! What's the matter with him? I haven't seen... - Well, how are you feeling now? - Oh, fine. - How's the shoulder? - All right. How you escaped being hurt, I'll never know. - Ann, do you know something? - What? That colt didn't throw me. I threw him. - What are you talking about? - You know what happened? I saw two jumps. I tried to take him over the wrong jump. You saw two jumps? Yes, that's what it was. It was the ghastliest feeling. Everything went fuzzy. Why didn't you tell Dr. Parsons these things? Oh, poor old befuddled Parsons. You know what he always says: "My dear, you've been staying up too late smoking." And the house is always filled with gangs of people and... If only he knew what happened last week at the Colony. What happened at the Colony? An old lady was coming through. I knocked her umbrella out of her hand. - Why? - Someone said I was drunk. Another time, coming out of Helene's on Park Avenue... I ran into a woman with her dog on a leash. - I ran right into the leash. - Oh, Judith...! I didn't hurt the dog, but the woman was furious. Confidentially, darling, this is more than a hangover. If you don't tell Parsons these things, I will. No you won't, Ann. You're my best and my truest friend, and you won't tell a soul. I wouldn't have told you except... Well, I won't have a dumb animal blamed for my mistake. Yes, Elizabeth, what is it? - Dr. Parsons is here. - Dr. Par...? I promised him you'd go to a specialist about that giddiness. But I haven't any time for doctors. Martha, bring my things. Listen, darling, you may be really ill. I haven't time to be ill. It's just some minor nonsense. Very well. If you're going up to town, I'm going. I won't have another tumble ruin your pretty clothes. Don't be silly. I'm perfectly all right alone. Oh, you're as stubborn as a mule. - Are we ready? - She says she's not going. Thank you, Martha. Darling, I've got so much to do. You have the big specialist examine her. Goodbye, children. Careful. No, I'm sorry, Dr. Parsons, I'm afraid it would be useless. Dr. Steele has closed his office, you know. Permanently. No, he's not coming back. - You're welcome. - Sounds good, eh, Wainwright? - I'm gonna cry in a minute. - I gotta be out in 45 minutes. What shall I do with this case of Dr. Parsons'? He's worried. He asked me to hold you here by force if necessary. You tell Dr. Parsons I waited nine years to catch this train. I'm not gonna miss it just because some nitwit fell off her horse. Listen to this: "Miss Judith Traherne, daughter of the late sportsman and wire manufacturer." - Imagine putting that in a case history. - You have Dr. Carter waiting for you. Say, I'm awfully sorry, doctor. I believe when I left, you were calling me an idiot. The boys at the club were talking about you. - They won't believe it. - What? A man in your position giving up a practice like this. Joe, what do you know about brain surgery? Well, I think if I had the surgical courage, I'd be in it. To go inside a human's skull... and tinker with the machinery that makes the whole works go. - That is romance, isn't it? - Romance, huh? There's your romance. - Florist bill? - Yes. Flowers for my last patient. He was a gifted young composer. The night before the operation, he started a new composition. He didn't finish it. - Maybe you read about it in the papers. - Yes. The operation was a brilliant success. But the patient just happened to die. - That's a pretty old joke, Fred. - Is it? Look at any brain surgeon's mortality rate... you'll find out just how unfunny it is. Are you quitting because you've lost your nerve? What? - What else can a man think? - I'm going back to medicine. - What do you mean, medicine? - A little laboratory on a farm in Vermont. Medical Research Bureau is backing me. Fisher will do the pathology. Incidentally, the best man in the country. How many men would give their eyeteeth for a practice you're throwing away? - What is this research, actually? - Cells. - Cells? - Brain cells. Why do healthy, normal cells go berserk, grow wild? Do you know? - No. - Nobody knows! But we call them cysts and gliomas and tumors and cancers. We hope to cure with the knife when we don't even know the cause. Our patients have faith in us because we're doctors and... Tell the boys they can split up my practice. And welcome. You and Pasteur. Someday, somebody will discover a serum that will be to these growths... what insulin is to diabetes and antitoxin is to diphtheria. And maybe earn his title of Doctor of Medicine. - Yes? - Dr. Parsons is here. - He is? - He insists. Well, I suppose I should be polite. - I must be going. - Your train. Yes, I know. - So long, Fred, old boy. You'll be back. - Don't hold your breath. - Good luck, old man. - Thanks. - Fred, can't you put this thing off? - Sorry, doctor, I've closed my office. - Have you read the case history? - Oh, you mean this gossip sheet? - A wire manufacturer's daughter? - Oh, please, never mind that. This girl's desperately ill. I've been watching her like a hawk, and she's been losing ground each day. Well, if two minutes will do you any good, I'll talk. - What's this about headaches? - She's been having them persistently. - Even before the accident, I suspect. - Before? She calls them hangovers. Three weeks? And you wait until now? You don't know that girl. She's a very stubborn patient. Only yesterday she went to a revival of Cyrano in the afternoon... and played bridge half the night. She won't cooperate. - She won't even tell me anything. - Won't talk, huh? Fred. We're old friends, and I'm desperate. I brought this little girl into the world. Took care of her father until he died. If she's such a great horsewoman, why was she thrown? That's it. It was a queer sort of accident. She crashed into the right wing of a jump... almost as if she'd held her horse deliberately at it. I was there. I saw it. - You're sure it was the right side? - Yes. Why? In that case, your best bet is to get in touch with Findlay. - Findlay's in Europe. - All right. Then get Park. I don't want Park or any of the rest of them. Hang it all, they're no better than I am. I want you. If I start making exceptions, I'll be stuck here another nine years. Fred, you're always talking about the obligation of doctors to humanity. - Well, Fred, there is humanity. - Sorry, doctor. It can't be done. - I told you I've closed my office. - This is ridiculous. - I'm late already. - Judy, please. This is Dr. Steele. - How do you do? My name's Traherne. - How do you do? Judith Traherne, or don't names matter? To that cold, scientific eye of yours, we're just guinea pigs, aren't we? - Glad to have met you. Come on, Ann. - Where did you get those burns? What burns? Your right hand. Here, between the first two fingers. I never noticed them before. I see. Will you come in here a minute, please? Come along, Judith. - You wait. - Let me have this, will you, doctor? I'll see Miss Traherne. - When it's time to go, warn me. - Certainly, doctor. Oh, just a moment, doctor. I haven't much time. Matter of fact, I haven't much time myself. Parsons tells me you're a great hunter. You could hardly expect me to enter your office leading a pack of hounds. Please. I understand you don't like to talk about your health. - That's right. - Any particular reason why? - It's just a boring subject, that's all. - Oh, most people love it. I make my living by listening. - Then you're wasting your time. - I'll send you a bill. I'm 23 years old, an only child. I weigh 110 pounds, stripped. I've had measles, mumps and whooping cough. I believe I have no congenital weaknesses. - Shall I go on? - Oh, yes, please. My father drank himself to death. My mother lives in Paris. I take a great deal of exercise. I'm accustomed to tobacco and alcohol. I'm said to have a sense of humor. Is that enough? All the inconsequential facts. Thank you. What are the consequential ones? - Does that light bother you? - Not at all. - Do you use your eyes a great deal? - I generally keep them open, doctor. What do you do on Long Island? Horses, dogs, shooting, yachting, travel, parties, gossip. All the pleasures of the station-wagon crowd. - You don't think much of that, do you? - No, not much. Why not? It just doesn't appeal to me. You condemn everything that doesn't appeal to you? Oh, by no means. You asked for my opinion, and I gave it. Well, anyway, that's my racket. - What's yours? - Mine? Brain surgery, large practice, about 10 days off every summer. Sounds awful. - It is. - Then why do you do it? Like yourself, I've been caught in a racket. Oh, doctor, what a relief to know that you're no better than I am. Thanks. But you see, I'm clearing out of my racket. I'm leaving for Vermont in about 15 minutes. You don't mean that narrow, pinched-up state on the wrong side of Boston? - That's the one. - No kidding? - No kidding. - What will you do, between yawns? - You wouldn't be interested. - Oh, come now. After leading me on like this... - Scientific research on cell growth. - In guinea pigs? - No, just cells. - Sounds silly. So I'm told. Still, I almost envy you. Must be nice to believe in what you're doing. - Don't you? - Not in the way you do. Oh, I'm not complaining. Take it all in all, they've dealt me a very good hand. I'm young, I have no particular responsibilities. I don't intend to cultivate any either. One's freer without. I shall probably marry someday. No hurry about that. When I do, I shall build a house on a ridge I know with a glorious view. I have my horses. Any luck, I'll have about 40 years of that. I think that's a pretty good setup. That light was bothering you. - There's nothing wrong with my eyes. - You were squinting. - I was not squinting. - I'm sorry, but you were. Well, suit yourself. It's your office. What did you do yesterday? I played bridge in the afternoon, I went to the theater in the evening. Other way around, wasn't it? - Yes, I guess it was. - What was the play? - Cyrano, wasn't it? - Yes, why? Did you like it? - I had such an awful headache, I... - How long have you had headaches? Oh, I... - I don't have them. - You have one now. No, I have not. How did you make out at bridge yesterday? - Let me think... - Quickly! - I don't remember. - I know, you lost. - Yes, I lost. - How much? How can I remember? I play bridge every day. - Losing a lot lately? - Yes. - Playing badly? - Well, I... - Forgetting what cards are out? - Why do you ask stupid questions? Wait. Did Dr. Parsons say you could go out yesterday? - I'm accustomed to looking after myself. - But you did disobey his orders. - What if I did? - Why pay a doctor, then disregard him? Someone else called him. - So you're taking orders from someone? - I've never taken orders from anyone. I'll never take orders from anyone. I'll tell you something else. I'm well, absolutely well. I'm young and strong. Nothing can touch me. Neither you nor Dr. Parsons can make an invalid out of me. I'm going. Wait! I'm sorry to have wasted your time. Run away because you're frightened. - That's not true. - Yes, it is true. That's why you held certain things back from Dr. Parsons. You were afraid to admit them. You didn't tell him you've been having these headaches for months. But you have. Lately, they've been getting worse, until now you're never free of them. And your eyes, they've been cutting up too. Just like somebody shutting a pair of folding doors... till your vision is almost cut in half. You pretended it was your imagination, but it isn't. Then that queer, dull feeling in your right arm. You can't laugh that off. I'll tell you how you got those burns on your fingers. A cigarette. You didn't feel the burns because your nerves are paralyzed. Your memory is all shot to pieces. You can't concentrate. Look at your bridge scores. And you're irritable because your nerves are all on edge. You won't admit it, but you can't deny it. Can you? Now I think we'll get somewhere. Come on. Come on. Now just hold my hand with your right. Now squeeze. Tight. Come on. Good and tight. That's it, good. Now the left. That's right. Now would you mind removing your coat? I'm afraid this coat is all there is. Just sit up here, then, would you? That's it. Maybe we can move this sleeve. - Yes. - Just a second. Miss Wainwright. Nothing in here to bother you. - Nearly time, doctor. - I know, I know. Now, give me your right elbow, please. Just relax. Now the left. Good. Now will you cross your knees, please? - That always makes me laugh. - It is silly, isn't it? Good. Now the left, please. Now don't be frightened of this. It's just an electric light. You're very kind to your guinea pigs, aren't you? Just look straight ahead, please. I've been told they're a nice color. - Do you agree? - Just once again, please. That they're a nice color? Oh, yes. Yes, fine. I'm going to ask you to close them. Hold your hands out, palms upwards, please. Now tell me what this is. - It's a cube. - Hard or soft? - Hard. - Good. Now can you tell me what this is. - I'm not quite sure. - I see. Just a minute. Tell me what that is. Move it around in your hand. Know what shape it is? I can't quite make out. - Can you tell me what this is? - A pencil, silly. That's right. - May I open my eyes now? - No, no. Not yet. Here. Is that cloth rough or smooth? - It's a piece of silk. - I see. I'm going to fool you this time. What's this? You can't fool me. It's still a piece of silk. - All right. You can open your eyes. - Am I promoted, teacher? Now I'm going to ask you two more questions. How long since you first noticed the headaches? Oh, horrible months ago. About five or six. - Your eyes been bothering you that long? - That's only lately. The last few weeks. Well, that's a big help. - Now I... - If you don't leave immediately... you'll miss that train. - Cancel the tickets. - Doctor... There are other trains on other days. - Yes, doctor. - Thank you. A few days one way or the other doesn't matter. - I'm sorry I'm so difficult. - You were a good sport. If I weren't that, doctor, I'm afraid I wouldn't be much of anything. Tell me. What's wrong with me? Is it my eyes? I'd be a pretty poor excuse for a doctor if I told you before I was positive myself. Anyway, I want you to have some x-rays taken, lots of them. Otherwise, you'll lead your normal life, see your friends, give parties. Do everything you have been doing, with one exception. - What's that? - You've got to see a good deal of me. I'll bet you'll be a frost at a party. Thank you. Anything else, gentlemen? No, I think that's all. - Can we go somewhere and talk? - Yes. Go right in here in the sitting room. - You'll find cigarettes on the table. - Thank you. Better put your shoes on. Hey, you guys be quiet! There are doctors in the house. - What have you got? - I don't know. Maybe it's kittens. - Well, what's the verdict? - Dr. Steele will talk to you. - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye, Miss Traherne. - I'll show the doctors out. - Then come up, will you? - All right. - Goodbye. Would you like a drink? No, thanks. Well? The prisoner will rise. The sentence? We've got to operate. Operate? On me? Where? No. Well, after all, the brain's like any other part of the body. Things get out of kilter, have to be adjusted. Oh, no, I won't. Ann. - Ann? - What's the matter? Come here. Quickly. Tell her. - He wants to operate. - Operate? - Yes, on my head. - Oh, no. You've made a mistake. I knew almost at once. I just wanted confirmation, that's all. - What's she got? - Yes, what have I got? Technically, it's called glioma. - Glioma? - Oh, don't listen to him. - It sounds like a kind of a plant. - Yes. It is rather like a plant, a parasitic one. - If it's taken care of... - All surgeons are alike, Judy. Don't be upset, darling. We can call in other doctors. We wait. Yes, yes, of course. But you have to face it sooner or later. Suppose we just don't talk about it anymore. - What? - Another headache, Miss Judith? No, not another headache. Yes, a big headache! And I'll have a bottle of champagne for it. I said no, and I mean no. Excuse me, please. She's very nervous. I can't do anything with her. She wants to see you. Did she take the medication? All right, let's get her to sleep. - It's still not too late to go home. - May I come in? - This is your doctor speaking. - Yes. - Hello. - Well, how is everything? - Everything's awful. - Is it? - Look what you make me wear. - They are pretty dowdy, aren't they? I suppose you brought some nice things of your own to wear? Yes, I did. Some lovely nighties. In fact, I bought two new ones especially for... - For this. - Miss Dodd, I don't see any reason... why Miss Traherne shouldn't wear her own things if she wants to. Martha, bring that over here. - See? - Oh, it's lovely. - You better turn your back. - No, I think like this. See, that's much better. There. Very pretty. Oh, thanks. - Here's a present for you. - What's that? Something to make you sleep. Come on. There. Thank you. But I don't want to sleep. Anyway, how could I in a 2-by-4 like this? I have a bed big enough for six. Why, I can't even move. Now just a moment. Let me show you something about this bed. Watch this. See that? Rest your legs. Now the back. There. That's for your back. Make you feel much more comfortable. Before you're through here, you'll wanna take it home with you. That is much better. You know, I can't understand about me. I've never given in a fraction to anyone before... and here I am letting you bounce me up and bounce me down. Exactly where...? Where does it happen? - Here, or...? - Now, now. That's my worry. How do you do it? What do you do? Chatterbox, aren't you? It is a distasteful subject, isn't it? Well, I don't care. I don't care about anything. This is a nice bed. It's a nice room too. Ann, you're miles away over there. Come here. I love you, Ann. I don't know what I'd do without you. I love you. Do you two like each other? - Of course. - Sure. Well, I want you to. Because I love everybody. - Will they cut off my hair? - Just a little. - I don't want my hair cut off. - It'll grow back. Of course it will. Silly of me. - You know something? - What? I feel so good. Nothing to think about. You're going to sleep now. That's right. I must do everything you say. I put myself in your hands. They're rather nice hands. Good, strong hands. - Doctor? - Yes? - Will you do something for me? - Yes. When you get inside my head, see if you can find any sense in it. Dr. Steele? Yes, Dr. Steele is all through in Surgery 7. - Good morning. - It's all clear. How are you, doctor? - Wednesday afternoon for right now. - All right, Wednesday afternoon. Dr. Driscoll, was that the laboratory's last word? I'm afraid so. - There's no hope? - No. Those are the pathological findings. She's bound to get a recurrence. And that means? About 10 months. - Invalidism, I suppose. - No. I think it's a rare case. She'd apparently be as well as any of us. That is, until... Well, her sight may fail her near the end. - Amblyopia. - Yes. There'd only be a few hours after that. And I brought her into the world. Hang it all, Steele. Don't stand there saying nothing. It's a rotten business, doctoring. What's the matter, Steele? Glioma. Malignant? A girl like that. So alive... so entitled to live. Then this thing, this growth, comes along and puts a period to it. Makes you almost wish it happened on the table. Are you going to tell her? Do you want her to know? No. Then there's your answer. Watch her temperature. I'll be back later. - I brought that little girl into the world. - Did you? Doctor? She'll be all right. - How long? - Oh, a few weeks' convalescence. Will she really be all right, just as she was before? I think I can promise a complete surgical recovery. You think so? What does that mean? Will she be well? Yes. - Martha, it fits beautifully, doesn't it? - Yes, ma'am. Couldn't tell a thing, could you? Thank you. That's very good. Behold. A new woman from top to toe. Don't get up, Alec. New shoes, new stockings, new dress, new head. - And a new disposition. - What was the matter with my old one? - Like it? - Oh, it's very nice. - Good. - Move your feet. Alec, behave. What was wrong with my old disposition? Never mind, darling. I've always loved you, despite your faults. - I gotta get another drink. - I have to go down too. Come on. - What's the matter? - Michael. He's taken to whistling for us. Whistling for us? Oh, Ann. It's Challenger. - Good afternoon, Michael. - Good afternoon, Miss Judith. How nice of you to bring him. - Oh, you have got him in good shape. - Yes, your little horse is in fine shape. Turn him around so she can see him. But he'll still never be a steeplechaser. We're teaching him to crochet. He's working on a set of doilies. You'll take that back when he wins the National. - Everyone here is glad you're back. - Are they? How nice. Yes, indeed they are. The boys at the stables, even the horses. Take your hat off when I'm talking to a lady. I'm very glad. Thanks for bringing him. Anything for you, Miss Judith. Anytime. All right, take him on. Doesn't the world smell nice? I wonder where our New England friend is. - Isn't that him coming through the gate? - Well, come on, then. Ann, do I look all right? Think I ought to change my dress again? Used to be six dresses on the floor, now it's 12. You used to be mad. And what that doctor's done for you, you're madder still. Don't let's make a fuss over him and spoil him. I'm going to be busy with my friends. I'm not going to seem too anxious. And don't you be too anxious either. - Hi. - Judy! - Carrie, hello. - Judy, you've never looked better. Thank you. - That hair. How clever. - Do you like it? Gwen, when did you get back? Good to see you. It's good, honey. Really good. This house has been a morgue. - Thank you. - Frank will sell you those horses. - Oh, how wonderful. - I'll talk to you. I'm a businesswoman. Let's have some champagne. - Where can he be? - He'll be here. I'll have some. He told me I could. Will you? - Yes. - Thank you, Agatha. - Here's to me. To life. - May you never be ill again. Thanks. - There he is. Have those things come? - I don't know. Go see, will you? - Colonel Mantle, Dr. Steele. - How do you do? Speaking generally, I consider doctors a pack of frauds. - Tried to tell me port is bad for my gout. - How do you do, Dr. Steele? - Hello, Judith. How are you? - Hello. Come on. That's my gang. They're here every day. - Sit down, will you? - Thanks. - You're late. - Yes. I was at the hospital. Were you? - Have a drink? - No, thanks. I had one. You said I could. Thank you again for everything. For my horse, my first day, my drink. - Been a good girl? - No. - I thought not. - Why? I knew you wouldn't be. I knew you couldn't be. What do you mean, a good girl? Well, I am. The idea. Did you drive in for lunch and come right back home? - Father, I cannot tell a lie. - What did you do? - Bought these shoes. - Oh, very pretty. Very nice. What else? This. Other new frocks I think you'll like. Oh, thanks for the 2 inches off my middle. And thank you for my life. What can I do for you? Oh, just wait. Why are you so grumpy? You always say I'm grumpy. I've been a good girl until today. I've practically been your slave. And I am well. Look. Reflexes, terrific. Balance, perfect. And I can walk a straight line. I can even walk backwards. Excuse me, will you? They're here. The man wants to see you. Good. Now, go and look out for our doctor. Kneel on him, club him if necessary, but make him have a drink. Get that look off his face somehow. Penny for your thoughts. - Oh, hello, Ann. How are you? - Hello. How are you? - You look as if you needed a drink. - No, thanks. - What do you think of Judith? - Fine. You did that. You should be very proud of yourself. Yes. Dr. Steele, when you came down to Judith's room right after the operation... you had a certain look on your face. I put it down at the time to the strain, the tension of the operation. I don't understand you. I saw that look on your face just now. I'm Irish. I may be psychic and funny. I'm probably quite wrong, but is there something? Something about Judith that you're holding back? If there is... Please, I am her best friend. Will you come outside, please? Then there is something. I can't save her. - Nothing can. Nothing. - What? She's going to die. No. No, that isn't true. You shouldn't have touched her. I'm not going to argue with you now. The facts are these... I'll try to tell you in simple layman's language. You mean she's going to have that pain again? And that ghastly confusion? No. She's not going to suffer anymore. That's all behind her now. Yes, but you told her she could ride. That's the freakish nature of this thing. She will ride. She'll seem well and normal, like everybody else. How long have you known? Since the operation. Why didn't you let her go then? I haven't jurisdiction over life and death. How will it come? Quietly. Peacefully. God's last small mercy. Will she have no warning? No chance to be ready? There may be a moment towards the end when... When her sight may not be quite as good as usual. A dimming of vision. Then a few hours, perhaps three, four. How long has she got? A year? Six months? - Four? - Possibly more. I don't believe it. Ann? - She must never know. - No. No. You sneaks, hiding out on me. What's the idea? Well, actually, we're talking about just how much you should do. I told him you'd had the devil of a day. He said it didn't matter. It's been the best day of my life. - This is for you. - Oh, Judith, you shouldn't. - What's in it? - A little gold and a lot of sentiment. From a grateful patient. Look at that man. I thought a surgeon had to have such steady hands. - Let me help you. - Oh, thank you. Oh, they're very pretty. I'm so glad you like them. We couldn't think of anything else, could we, Ann? Of course, it isn't enough. I've an idea. This is my birthday. - What? - Well, it is really, you know. My new birthday. Let's all three of us each year get together and celebrate, shall we? - Come on. - All right. Let's have some champagne right now and start. Come on, everybody, we're going to have champagne. - Where have you been, Judy? - Outside. Now, I'll wear my green slacks in the morning... and my big hat for lunch. He'll like that. I've got to look my best. If ever Judy had to knock them for a row of pins... Oh, Agatha. Here are the menus for the weekend. Martha, come here. Now, it's up to you. For evening... Ann, do you think we ought to dress for dinner tomorrow night? - Give him a bit of swish? - Just as you please, darling. Oh, no, I don't think so. They'll be tired. I'm getting to be such a hostess. This is my first real weekend. The house just reeks of dignity. Of course, I'll have the kids in. I'll always have them. I don't think he minds them, do you? - I don't suppose he will. - What's the matter? Nothing. I've got to get through these bills. It's the 10th of the month. You'll put on your best dignity, won't you? And help me keep dignified? Well... I'm here, and I think I'm somewhere very nice. Look at me. I'm looking at you. You're in love? Yes. I thought so. What about him? - Has he given you any encouragement? - Not a ripple on the water. He drives me crazy, but... But when I just think of him, I... And when I think if I hadn't fallen off that horse... It was awful. But it was wonderful. Life's a different thing. For the first time, I wake up with something to live for. Something besides horses and hats and food. He's very fine, isn't he? Very worthwhile, isn't he? Oh, if only the Spaniards or the French had settled New England... instead of the Pilgrims. Yes, but if he hasn't given you any signs, how do you know? Well... that's it, I don't know. But he didn't go away. That's one sign, Mr. Watson. Must mean something. Don't be against me. I'm not against you. Good. Ann? - Will you do something for me? - Of course. I was thinking, you might take advantage of any lull in the conversation tomorrow... just to mention what a good wife Judith would be. What an ideal wife. - Well, don't you think I would be? - Oh, the best. Well, keep both fingers crossed for me. Ann, one day it'll happen to you. And you'll know how wonderful it is. Martha? Martha? Murray Hill 7-7340. May I have Miss Judith's telephone book, please? Is that Murray Hill 7-7340? May I speak to Dr. Steele, please? What is it? You and I have got something to talk about. Yes? Does Judith mean anything more to you than just a patient? Perhaps it's impertinent of me to ask you. No, it isn't. I think I know. I think you do care for her. Yes, Ann. I do care. So much. What are you going to do? Are you going to go up there and tell her... and hold her in your arms? Are you? Or go away and leave her to us? Which is better? I don't know. - I haven't slept for two nights. - Neither have I. This morning I saw it coming. And just now, a little while ago, I asked her to her face, "Do you love him?" And she answered, "Yes, I do." It's up to you. She said that? You know, Ann, before, women never meant anything to me. I'd never met anyone like her. I was all set. I had plans, made arrangements. I know, Vermont. Why don't you go away for your own sake and that of your work? Work. How can I work when I can't cure her? Nothing else on my mind. I just sit here. I can't think of anything else. Oh, Ann. - I'd give my body if it'd do any good. - Isn't there anything? Anything? What's she ever done this should happen to her? She's never harmed a soul. She's never done anything to anyone except kindness. I know. Here, look. Here's a letter I got today from Vienna. The last finding in the case. There's the translation. Not a chance in the world. I don't know where to look next. Here's this Heinzig in Vienna, the greatest in the world. Twelve of them. "Prognosis negative." "Negative." Negative. Oh, I'm so sorry for you both. You couldn't marry her. You know what she'd expect. A home, children, plans for the future. You couldn't do that to her. The great thing, Ann, is for her never to know. Could you stand watching her growing happier every day... with this thing creeping up behind her? Could you stand that? I couldn't. It isn't a question of what you or I could stand. The main thing is for her to be happy... every hour. Ann, all my life I've been able to tell people what to do. - Now I... - Telephone, doctor. This is Dr. Steele. Are you operating, doctor? Are you in your office, doctor? Well, there's a very good friend of yours waiting for you here. A very grateful patient. Well, you'd better hurry. I have a vague feeling of relapse coming on. All right, hurry up. Bye. Ann? - Ann? - She's out, Miss Judith. Where did she go? Weren't you telephoning the doctor's office? - Yes. - Well, wasn't Miss Ann there? What do you mean? She made an appointment. Said she was going down there. - Today? - Yes. Just a little while ago. Oh, well, that's funny. - Hello. - Hello, Judy. - Where have you been? - For a drive. - Where did you go? - Town. - What for? - Shopping. What did you buy? Ann, where did you go? Judy. - Good afternoon. - How do you do? Oh, hello. - You did hurry. - Yes. How are you, Ann? Did I stumble into something? Yes. We were on the verge of a jealous scene about you. What? Darling. Poor fool... don't you know I'm in love with you? Would you like some tea or a drink? Tea, I think. - Elizabeth. - Yes, Miss Judith. - Bring me some tea, please. - Yes, miss. Sorry. You couldn't have said anything I wanted to hear more. Judy, dear. I love you so much. These books go to the medical library, New York City. - Do you understand? - Yes, Miss Wainwright. Hey. Is anybody here? - How do you do, Miss Traherne? - Hello, Wainwright, how are you? - Fine. The doctor isn't here. - Where is he? We're to have lunch. He wants you to meet him at the restaurant. I haven't had a chance to congratulate you. Oh, thank you. It's a strange world, isn't it? First time I came here, you were packing... and it was the end of my life. Now, you're still packing... and my life is just beginning. - Couldn't I help you while I'm waiting? - No, thanks. We're all finished. - Almost. - All set, lady. - Excuse me, please. - Certainly. - Take those boxes out and come back. - Yes, ma'am. You know, I darn near broke my neck to get that doctor of yours. I'm mad about him. Of course, it's the screwiest setup. Vermont and Long Island. We live in different worlds. I wonder if Vermont and I will understand each other. What do you think? I don't know much about Vermont, except what he's told me. He loves it, doesn't he? Well, then I will too. You know, Wainwright, I'm going to sell my house, my apartment and my horses. All except Challenger. I'll keep him. He's a champion. - Am I disturbing you? - Not at all. I'm glad he's going to give up cutting people open. He's one of the great scientists. And I'll be Mrs. Pasteur. We'll be such useful people in the world. "To all to whom these present shall come, greeting be it known... Frederick Steele as a fellow of the something-or-other." I'll tend his house and mind his books... and answer his mail and... "Judith Traherne." Wainwright? What does "prognosis" mean? It means what the future of a case looks like. What does "negative" mean? That's not so good. It means hopeless. You said the bar. We've been looking all over this place for you. - Take away the flowers, will you? - Yes, ma'am. I'm awfully sorry, darling. Had a consultation. Gee, you look lovely. - Have a drink. - No, thanks. - You should have one someday. - I will. Perhaps on our wedding day. Our wedding day. What's the matter? Could anything be? - How many of those have you had? - Several. - If I'm late, I'm sorry. - Ann, don't be sorry. About anything. Sit down and join us. We're playing games. Hide-and-seek. You can play too. Puss in the Corner. - What's she talking about? - Nothing. Would you like me to leave? You two dear friends must have so much to talk over. My dearest friends. Have a cocktail. I'm going to have another. - Waiter. - Yes, I'll have a cocktail. You sure you won't have one? Two of the same. They're fine. They deaden the brain. You know about brains. They loosen the inhibitions. Make the tongue waggle. Are you sure you're feeling quite well, darling? You should know how well I am. Am I well? It's a secret. Or don't you two know about secrets? - Judith, will you...? - Judy, darling. Oh, Carrie, dear. What a nice hat. - You remember the eminent Dr. Steele. - Yes, of course. Judy says you're frightfully good. You must look me over sometime. Sit. My dear, if you've anything wrong with you at all, fly to him at once. Of course. Will I see you at the Radcliffe Hunt? - Of course. - Judy, you'll be in Vermont. Oh, yes, Vermont. - I hear it's cold in Vermont. - In the winter, but it's nice. - You must come to Vermont, Carrie. - I will. Anyway, nice to have seen you. Goodbye, Ann. Doctor. I meant to ask you, doctor. Will I be a specimen case? Will I be in the medical journal? Shall we order? Waiter. Would you mind telling me what this is all about? Why don't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? Well, I... I think I'll have a large order of "prognosis negative." - What do you mean? - You know. Prognosis negative. Do you know what prognosis negative means? Explain to her. Or have you? Means a few months of pretending you're well, then blindness, then... Wait, Judith. We can't talk in here. Oh, yes, we can. It was a question of humoring the patient. Give the poor dear everything she wants. Time's so short. Marry her if necessary. I know why you went to his office that day. To beg him to marry me out of pity. The kind Dr. Steele. You're both so kind. So long, my friends. Judith, you're wrong. Let my heart be still And listen to one song of love Let me feel the thrill Of quiet we know nothing of Oh, give me time for tenderness To hold your hand And understand Oh, give me time It's 4:00, sir. Last drink. - Two here, two there. Same thing. - Yes, sir. - It's funny. - What? Time, Alec. Did you ever think about time? It goes, Alec. That's the business of time. Tick, tick, tick. You can almost hear it go by. Before you know it, it's gone. - Then where are we, my friend? - High and dry. That's the last drink. - I want to hear that song again. - What song? That song about time. Too late again. Orchestra's going home. Hi. - I wanna hear that song again. - It's time to go to bed. Oh, mustn't go to bed. Mustn't sleep. It's a waste. Time doesn't sleep. That's a joke. Here. - Come on, sing, please. - Thanks. Come on, boys. Fifty. "Time for Tenderness," Malcolm. I will never ask For more than you can give Yet when you say, "Be gay today and live" My heart answers cautiously "Today will soon be gone" Why rush to meet our destiny? Why must we hurry on? Oh, give me time for tenderness One little hour From each big day Oh, give me time to stop and glance The golden sunset of a summer day Let my heart be still And listen to one song of love Let me feel the thrill Of quiet we know nothing of Oh, give me time for tenderness To hold your hand And understand Oh, give me time - Tell Patches I'll meet you at the bar. - Right. - Hello, Judy. - Nice work, Judy. Hooray for me. Give me a light, will you? Thanks. Oh, Judy, darling, you were wonderful. Drink the bar dry, but you still retain your seat. - Hello, Martha. - Excuse me, miss. - How's the old homestead? - All right, Miss Judith. You know, I don't know how you do it. It amazes me how you stick on a horse. I'm one of your best friends. - I don't care what people say about you. - How nice of you. Drink the town dry. Take all their husbands and sweethearts. - I still say it's none of my business, but... - But I'd agree with you. Well, of course, if you want to adopt that attitude. You can already fill the Yale Bowl with people who are sore at you. One more doesn't matter. Martha, I can't possibly change unless I have a drink. - Miss Traherne, could we have you now? - No, I want another drink. - Hello, Judith, darling. - Oh, Miss Judith. - Yes, Michael. - I'm going now. I've got the horses packed. It's snowing outside. I want to get back. - Good. - You did very well. Thank you, Michael. - Oh, Miss Judith. - What? I wonder if you'd care to drive back with me. That mare's got bronchitis and can't possibly last the night. - Hello, George. Jessica's Girl? - Yes. Why don't you put her out of her misery. I'll get there if I can. - Judith, darling. - Hello. Sit down, please. - Hi. - Hello, Judy. - Hello, Judy! - Here's a tragedy for you. Jessica's Girl has bronchitis and can't possibly last the night. Jessica's Girl is a horse. Poor Jessica's Girl. - The usual. - Here we go again. - Judy, darling. - Yes. Trotty, trotty! Fix me up, will you? - Where's Ann? - She blew. I guess the way you were riding gave her the jitters. - Poor Ann. - Miss Traherne, please. - They want you to come... - I got you. The cup. Yes, the cup. I'll tell them you're coming. The cup. The darling cup. - Excuse me, kids, I've won a prize. - Hurry back. - If it isn't the extraordinary surgeon. - I've been trying to see you. How's the mortality rate these days? Having fun with the knives? - Drop it. - Why aren't you in Vermont? - You know why I'm not. I want to talk. - When I need a doctor, I'll send for one. - I'm not in your care. - You'll always be in my care. Will I? Is that part of your duty? To hang on till the very end, to watch with those scientific eyes? Drop it! I know how you feel. Anything to strike back at me, but don't do it this way. - What do you mean? - This. There's nothing in it. What do you want me to do? Stay alone in my room and think how in a few...? I want you to find peace. We all have to die. The tragic difference is that you know when and we don't. But the important thing is the same for all of us. To live our lives so that we can meet death whenever it comes. - Beautifully and finely. - "Beautifully and finely." - I'll die as I please. Leave me alone. - You hate me, don't you? I hate you so much for so many reasons. I hate you for not telling me the truth. I hate you for letting me hurl myself at your head. I'm so ashamed. I can understand. Miss Traherne, please, they're waiting. Let them wait. They've got plenty of time. Oh, all right. - Wait, Judy. - No, no, I have to go in for the cup. - Dr. Steele? How do you do? - Hello, Alec. - Could I buy you a drink? - No, thanks. Judy's certainly on this town, all right. - You're talking about a friend of mine. - Oh, yeah? Yes. - Say... - Well, what's the matter? He made a crack about Judy, and the gentleman socked him. - You think she'll pull through, doc? - I think so. Respiration's easier. Yeah. Lucky we got her in time. - Is she dead? - No. It was touch-and-go for a while. It's more touch than go now. I actually said a prayer. She's game, though. Put up a brave fight. Oh, you're cold? I have a fire in the tack room. Would you like to go in and warm yourself? Why not? Well, thanks, doc. - Call me if you need me. - I will. Good night. - Clarence, get yourself some blankets. - Yes, sir. The first cold's always the bitterest. The first and the last. Talk to me, Michael. - What shall I talk about, Miss Judith? - Anything. Just talk. It was a great show. I came to think you may not be wrong about Challenger. - Did you? - I was scared, though. Was I that bad? No, but something about the way you ride puts my heart in my mouth. You mind if I say something to you, Miss Judith? Of course not. I asked you to talk, didn't I? I think you've been going too hard, night and day. You can't do that and keep on with your jumping horses. It's hard on you. I was hoping that maybe, in the state of mind you were in... you wouldn't ride tonight. - A silver cup isn't worth it. - I wanted that cup. I had to show the gentry I've still got what it takes. You sure have. I told you to keep on talking, Michael. You know, you and I are kind of alike, Miss Judith. Are we? How? You've the spirit in you the same as I have in me. It's the fighting that counts. You've got to have action in your life same as I do. We only live once, Miss Judith. Just once. - Tell me about you, Michael. - Me? Yes, you. As one human to another. We've always talked about horses. What's there to say? Well, do you have a happy life, Michael? I guess I was born out of my time, Miss Judith. I should've lived in the days when it counted to be a man. The way I like to ride and the way I like to fight. What good's riding and fighting these days? What do they get you? What are you trying to do, burn us up? Are you afraid to burn, Michael? Are you afraid to die? I wouldn't want to die while you're alive, Miss Judith. You're making love to me. Aren't you? You invited me to talk to you as a man, didn't you? - Yes. - I'm as good as some of them... that's been playing with you. They're all afraid of you. I've heard them talking. They'd go after you, but they're afraid. I wish to heaven I was in their boots. What then, Michael? The nights I've laid awake thinking of you. The things I've wanted to say to you ever since I first laid eyes on you. - You're afraid. - No. - Is it because I'm a stable hand, is it? - No, Michael, it isn't that. I just can't go on this way. First, it's this. Then it's something else. Michael, I just can't die like this. Die? Yes. I'm going to die in a few months, Michael. Oh, heaven forgive you for saying a thing like that. Yes. Heaven forgive me. When it comes... it must be met beautifully and finely. That's what he said. Oh, I'm all shot, Michael. Murray Hill 7-7340. Ann, you should be asleep. Poor Ann, you've had so little sleep. Where did you go after you left the club? I've been worried about you. To the stables, with Michael. - Judith. - Don't worry, darling, I was saved. Of course, for what I was saved isn't quite clear. Was that Steele you were calling up? It doesn't matter. Wasn't any answer. This business of apologizing to a man. It really doesn't matter. Ann, I'm tired. So tired. Come along. Let me put you to bed. Why? I'll read you to sleep. Why? So I can dream? Oh, Judith, my darling, please don't talk like that. Please don't. Ann, I don't know what to do. It's the waiting. Day and night. Would I be wrong if I made it happen? Now, would I? Judith, please don't talk like that. Don't. Please. Don't. Please don't. I see the dawn come up about four days out of seven in this place. Something always seems to happen. - Say, can I fix you another drink? - No, thanks. Who can be calling at this hour in the morning? Hello? Judy! Yes, he's here. Come on up. You know, push the 10th button in the elevator. - Judy? - Yeah, it's Judy. I've loved her for a long time, but I can't help her now, because... You're the one man, so be nice to her, will you? All right. - Hello, Alec. - Hello, Judy. Hello, doctor. Hello, Judy. Nice time to come calling, isn't it? Come in. You know, I searched half the town for you two. I even rang your night bell. - I thought doctors were on 24-hour duty. - Alec kindly asked me to come around... and we've been talking. - Did I interrupt something? - Oh, to the contrary. The dawn's well up, and I was gonna cook eggs and bacon. Wouldn't you like some? I just thought of it as a way to get me out. I'm kind of bright that way. Glad you dropped in, Judy. Fix her a drink, doc. Shall I make one? No, thank you. You could do something for me, though. What? Forgive me. There's nothing to forgive. Oh, but... The things I said to you. Darling... it's good to say things. Gets them off your chest. I understood. Did you? - Do you? - Yes. You said you wanted me to have peace. Where is peace? Within yourself. Judy, come here. I tried to do all the things I said I would. Tonight, I... Darling, there's been no one but you. Darling. How good it is to call you that again. I had to come and tell you no one. See, I couldn't go on with the thought that you might be bitter toward me. I didn't want you to think of me like that. But I love you, Judy. I know you do. May I take back every rotten thing I ever said to you? Oh, darling, help me. I've been so stupid. I've crammed every minute so full of waste, and... Now there's so little time left... and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid. You're so right and strong. It's all right now, Judy. It's all right. May I see you sometimes? You're going to see me every day. You're coming to Vermont with me. - Am I? - Yes. Maybe we'll find that peace there together. No. No, that wouldn't be fair to you. - We'd have so little... - Forever, Judy? Will you marry me? Marry? Oh, wouldn't it be marvelous if we could? Have a real wedding and be given away and... With church bells and champagne... and a white frock, orange blossoms... and a wedding cake. That's one thing I won't have missed. And you're giving it to me. I can never love you enough. Judy. Good morning, Elmer. Blowy, isn't it? Sure is, Mrs. Steele. - How's the sciatica? - Fine, Mrs. Steele. - Martha. - Yes, Miss Judith? - Here's a letter from Miss Ann. - Is she coming up? Not yet, but soon, I think. "I'm still trying to rent the house, but no one has any money... and I'm not going to let tramps have it." Why do people complicate their lives so, Martha? All those horses and that house. Here we have nothing, and yet we have everything. - Haven't we? - I think you have, Miss Judith. A wonder she hasn't come to see you. You haven't seen her for three months. Oh, she'll be up soon. She wants to finish her work first. - What's that? - The doctor's lunch. - Hasn't he had it yet? - No. - Why not? - I knocked on his door twice. When he's busy with his bugs, he's like a bear with a sore head. - I wouldn't disturb him for... - Well, I'll disturb him. Am I afraid? Thank you, Martha. Hey. Your lunch, doctor. - Judy, I've told you... - You were rude to Martha. I was not rude to Martha. Martha knows, as you should know, that... Well, Henry, the damage is done. What damage? Me? I've told you never to come in when I'm working. This joint is aseptic. You're crawling with microbes. - Bugs. - Me? - Yes, you. - That's a fine way to talk to your wife. Coming in here with all this food. We got too many bugs here now. And just as I was about to discover the secret of life. Well, maybe not at this particular moment. Oh, but you will. And you might have. Guess it is my fault. Judy, darling. - I am sorry. - There's nothing to be sorry for. Your bugs met my bugs and the food's bugs... and they had a party, and they're gonna get so drunk... they won't be any use to anybody. - You're mad. - Yeah. Henry. - Yes? - Get that food out of there. Prepare for another experiment. If at first you don't succeed, then try, try... I'm hungry. Do you realize it's almost 2:00? Don't you touch that. It's probably got bugs in it. If the sandwiches' bugs got into your bugs... your bugs got into the sandwiches'. - Just a minute. - No. - All right. All right, toughie. - It's cold. - What's new in the world? - Guess what. I got a letter from Ann. She's coming to visit us. Read it. - What did you do this morning? - Big things. - What? - I walked. Here. Can't have that, it's got bugs in it. - Where did you walk? - To the village. May we use your table, Martha? - Why, of course, Miss Judith. - Sit down. - What's new in the village? - There's a well-founded rumor... that it'll be twins for Mrs. Dibble. This is great. We'll show her the great village of Brattleboro. The shopping district, the city hall, and we'll take her to the dance on Saturday. Now what? Come here. What did you do? Here you go, Daffy. Thank you, Ellen. - Here we are. - Here she is, Martha. - Hello, Martha. How are you? - It's good to see you, Miss Ann. We're gonna fatten her up with country gravy. - It's perfect. - Don't you like it? - Wanna see my lab? - Yes, I'd love to. Bring the things in, Ellen. We'll unpack for you. Don't take her in. She's got bugs too. Oh, this is nice. Ann, isn't Judy beyond words? - No blue moans at all? - No. We never even think about it. We don't even talk about it. - And you mustn't. - Of course not. Not even with your eyes. You'll be tempted to, but watch yourself. You see, we just pretend that nothing's going to happen. Understand? Come on, I'll show you the rest of the place. Ann, this is Henry Curtiss. Miss King. How do you do? - Well, how do you like it? - It's splendid. Well, someday, perhaps in my lifetime or somebody else's lifetime... we'll find a serum that will put an end to these growths. Judy, your thingamabobs have come. - My what-abobs? - Your seeds, your flowers. - Oh, how wonderful. - A tongue twister: "Incomparabilis." Ladies, what kind of language is that? - Incomparabilis. - Incomparabilis. - Be sure you plant them in the sun. - I will. Here's one for you. Jonquilla Narcissus. That's a good one. I'll name a horse after that one. - Go along with you. - I'm going along. Goodbye, Miss Ann. Goodbye, Mr. O'Leary. And now to be serious. About the Grand National. I knew there was a reason why you came up. I still think $ 1000 entry fee's a lot of money to waste on that horse. It won't be wasted. Bet you 6-4 Challenger wins. - You got a bet. - Shake. - Have a good time in Philadelphia. - I'm excited. I'll wear all my best clothes, and we'll go on a tear. - You're looking fine. - Am I? Good. Yeah, sure. It makes me believe in those prayers I've been saying. So long, doc. Don't call him doc. That isn't respectful. See you at the National. Bye. Ann. - There's a storm coming. - What? It's getting darker by the minute. We'll have to take our raincoats with us. Suppose it'll rain cats and dogs and ruin all our nice bulbs. Look how it's clouding up. It's getting darker every second. It's funny, I can still feel the sun on my hands. - Judith. - Ann! The sun has gone. There are clouds. It is getting dark. It's all right. It's all right, Ann. Judy. Judith. If the Ladies' Gardening Group can adjourn their meeting... I've got some news. We're not going to Philadelphia. We're going to New York. I've just read a wire over the telephone. I'll show you. Come on, Judy. Come on. Not a word. Darling, this is great news. Read it. A wire from Fisher in Philadelphia. Martha wrote it down. Well? - How nice. - "How nice"? Is that all? Ann, you read this. I never could read Martha's writing. Well, Ann, of all the profound understatements... "Doctor Frederick Steele, Brattleboro, Vermont. Wild with excitement over your latest report. Biological tests convince me you may be on right road with isolation." Isolation, see? Choke off the oxygen. Well, you two wouldn't understand. Go ahead, read it. - "Believe we..." - Here, I'll do it. "Believe we should present material in New York tomorrow. Please wire. My congratulations, Fisher." - Isn't that marvelous? - It's wonderful. Isn't it, Ann? I was... I was just bowled over for a minute. Sure, so was I. I wired Fisher I'd meet him at 10:00 in the morning. - Did you? - Yeah. It means driving to Mill's Junction to catch the 4:40. Martha's packed you, but I can't even find my socks, so hurry. No. Come on. What are you going to do? I don't know. Nothing. - You can't go. - No. - You can't let him go. - Judy? We can't be late, because this board convenes just twice a year. Some of the men are coming from Boston. Some as far as Kansas City. And a very distinguished man, Heinzig of Vienna is coming. They're gonna sit around that table and tell if your boy's right or not. So come on, hurry. Oh, Ann. Can't you see? I can't stop that. Can you see anything? Can you see me? Not very well. "Dimming of the vision. Then blindness. Then..." Oh, if I can only last till he goes. Now, Ann... come on. Go back to your garden and plant your flowers as if nothing had happened. Dear Ann. I know what I must do. Go on. Go on. Judy. Coming. You know what this means, don't you? Means that in five or 10 years, I'll begin to get someplace. It's very exciting, isn't it? I might even be acclaimed. Might get our picture in the paper. - You'll make history. - Say, which one are you gonna wear? Darling, I don't think I'll go. - You haven't packed enough shirts. - What do you mean, you're not going? Ann and I were talking. I think I'll stay with her. New York will do you good. You can buy new clothes. - I don't need new clothes. - Then you can see your friends. Darling, please let me stay. All right, then. You know, New York would bore me now. Really it would. - You see, this is my home here. - Oh, Judy. Why, you're trembling. Am I? Can't a girl be a little sentimental? This is the first time we've been separated. Judy, I'm not going. I don't know what I could've been thinking about. - I'll call Fisher and tell him. - Are you worried about me? Yes. Every second you're out of my sight. That's ridiculous. You needn't be. Ann's here. Judy... if anything should happen... Hush. We mustn't talk about that. We agreed not to. You know I'm not afraid anymore. Look, a hole. You'd make a fine figure at a board meeting with your big toe sticking out. Oh, darling, come on. You know, I used to be afraid. I've died a thousand times. When death really comes, it will come as an old friend. - Gently and quietly. - Oh, Judy. Oh, we've had so much. If we lived to be 100, we could have no more. And I've been so happy. - When the time comes... - When it comes, I'm going with you. I will. You couldn't be that unkind to me. I couldn't live without you. You must. You will. - You must go on with your work. - But it's futile and meaningless. Cruel. Not if you take revenge for it. Revenge? Yes, revenge. By going on with this work and these experiments. By wiping out something... that will take me from you one day. And with each blow you strike... you can say, "That was for Judith, my wife." Come on. - Lucy. - Yes, ma'am? Now, no more nonsense. You run off to New York and have your big moment. And I'll wait home as a proper wife should. - Darling. - Yes? Tell me something. Have I been a good wife? Oh, Judy. That makes me very happy. Happier than anything else. I've loved it so, every minute. How can I make you understand? Look out there. Somehow, it's been like that. Shining and quiet. Yes, Judy. It has. Hasn't it? Nothing can hurt us now. What we have can't be destroyed. That's our victory. Our victory over the dark. It is a victory because we're not afraid. Come on. I'm sorry, it must be the going away. Judy, you're marvelous. Remember while you're away, tie your tie properly and brush your hair. - And for heaven's sakes, buy a new hat. - That's a good hat. I can't let you go looking like a country farmer. Come say goodbye to the old boy. Ann, he's off. Thanks, Lucy. Here's a list of places you can reach me. We won't need it. Run along. - Drive like mad. - Take care of everything, won't you? - Yes. - Goodbye, darling. - Now, mind yourself in the big city. - I'll be all right, but it's gonna be lonely. Don't tempt me. Get going. Bye. Hurry home! Have you planted the hyacinths yet? Yes. No, I don't know. Come on. I must help you plant them. See, they're his favorite flower. You'll dig the holes, I'll put them in. I want to very much. Thank you. - You didn't go, Miss Judith. - No, Martha. Come along, Ann. You will water my flowers, won't you, Ann? Take care of them. And, Ann, you will take care of my doctor, won't you? He'll need someone. He mustn't be alone. You see, it's so much worse for him than it is for me. Oh, really, that's true. I'm the lucky one. All I'll miss is growing old and being tired and worn-out. Never leave him, will you? I promise. Don't. Don't, Ann. I'm happy, really I am. Now, let me see... if there's anything else. Oh, yes, one more thing. When Michael runs Challenger in the National... And he'll win, I'm sure he'll win. have a party... and invite all our friends. Now, let me see. Silly old Alec, if he's back from Europe. Colonel Mantle and old Carrie and... Oh, yes, and don't forget dear old Dr. Parsons. Give them champagne and be gay. Be very, very gay. I must go in now. Ann, please understand. No one must be here. No one. See, I must show him I can do it alone. Perhaps it will help him over some bad moments to remember it. Ann, be my best friend. Go now. Please! - Martha? - Miss Judith. I'm going up to lie down now. Oh, Miss Judith... Daffy. Daffy, Don. Don, come here. Oh, darlings. Darlings. Now... Now, go down now. Go on. Go, darlings. - Is that you, Martha? - Yes, Miss Judith. I don't want to be disturbed.
