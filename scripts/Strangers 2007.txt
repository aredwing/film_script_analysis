I could never hold my breath long enough. You are going to leave me. Please don't leave me. You are nothing but a kindness.. ..selfish coward and I never want to see you again. I see someone sitting there. Oh really! I am so sorry for disturbing you. - lts okay. Cheers! - Thank you. I am sorry. Your luggage was unattended. So I thought I should call the authorities. Bomb! I am sorry I disappointed you.. Mr. Rai. You know my name. Why? Don't you know my name? Have we met before? Are you scared of something? - Sorry! I mean even if we had met before.. ..then it wouldn't have been so scary. Look.. I am not scared. Will you have some? - No. Thanks. Why? Don't you take anything offered by others? Don't worry. Nothing is mixed in this. I won't run away with your luggage. So.. how do you know me? Fear. Because of a fear. I don't understand. Its written in the books, when a person does anything.. ..then he is driven by some fear. You got scared when you saw my luggage. Thinking that you are alone you started sweating. Let it be. Anyway. I had checked your name in the passenger's list. Do you ever read the passenger's list? No. It's so interesting! Read it sometimes! You find out with whom you are going to journey. Some woman is travelling with a man and there is.. ..a possibility of something happening between them. Some Pakistani has to travel with an lndian. How will the next 1 2 hours be? Etc, etc, etc! You get an interesting insight. Try it sometime. But alas.. you checked the passenger's list and you.. ..found out that you are going to journey with a boring man. Quite on the contrary! Reading your name I realized that.. ..this is going to be a journey of a lifetime, sir. Well, let's hope so. Let's hope it's a journey of a lifetime. And we will have a good journey. And you have still not told me your name. What's there in a name, Mr. Rai? Shakespeare screamed and died. But nobody heard him. By the way you too don't follow Shakespeare's values. Otherwise why would you check the passenger list? Thou too don't follow Shakespeare. I will have to agree on that, Mr. Rai. You win. And I have lost. Let's do one thing. Let's play a game. Get to know your fellow passenger. It's very simple. You try to guess about me. And l.. will guess about you. Don't worry. I won't do anything serious.. that will lead.. ..to us being thrown out of the train. By the way.. I am Rahul. Stop that music! So Mr. Rai.. how right have I been? I don't know. I felt as if l am some '70s movie's villain. I have packed your clothes. You check your papers. I will check it. Thank you. Shall I serve your meal? - Yes! When will you return? I will return by 25th. - Is that so? Can't you return sooner? Amit's birthday is on the 23rd. Yes! Have you organised some function? No. But I am performing the veneration. You at least call. - Fine. Tell me something, Mr. Rai. What's the difference between fiction and reality? Between story and reality? No idea! What's my reality? Rahul.. you are entangling me in words. That is not true, Mr. Rai. At least tell me.. what according to you is my reality? According to me what is.. your reality? You are a.. cartoonist. People around him either have long nose.. ..or some politicians have Superman's body. He mocks everybody. And no matter how bleak the situation is, he.. Mr. Rai, seeing you I felt you are Alfred Hitchcock. An exceptional story teller. But I am disappointed in you. You fabricate good stories. But your perception.. that is a bit weak. Maybe because you believe a lot in romance. You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss.. your lips. There is no tenderness anymore in your.. You are trying hard not to show it. But baby, baby, I know. You have lost that love and feeling. All that love and feeling. You have lost that love and feeling. Now it's gone, gone, gone. We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday. If you could only love me like you did. I narrated my problems to her. Smiling she said something, something.. You are staring at me the way my.. ..neighbours used to stare at me. And now you are going to be judgmental. And I am going to get the character certificate.. ..of a bad character. Have you read this story before? No. I was thinking why did you marry Preeti? Mr. Rai, the thing is that I fell in love. And this is the truth. Rahul, there is no truth. Truth is what we believe in. Mr. Rai, right now you spite me. You see my story is so unusual. And I should have narrated to you in the usual way. Let's begin again. This story is 5-6 years old. Now its.. - 2006. Yes! So it occurred in 2000. And the setup is this.. bookstore. Can I help you? - No. That's okay. I am just browsing. This one comes with the writer's autograph, by the way. Really? - Yeah. Rahul! Is he famous? - He is new! First book! How does he write? - Okay. Worth buying, I guess. Don't you think it's a bit expensive? No, no! He writes well. It's nice. There is no review in the papers. Must be one of those lndian writers, you know. Lost in London. I think you should read it. - Why? You will like it. - What if I don't? Then I will take you out for dinner. - That was quick. What if I like it? Then you can take me out for dinner. And I will do one thing.. instead of my autograph.. ..I'll scribble down my number. You can call me when you are through with it. From thoughts into the paper. But this was worst. I believe there is not much difference in writing and shitting. Its one and the same thing. You know.. what is troubling you.. you extricate that. It's the same with writing. Whatever you have in your head gets a vent. Release of pressure. But.. now I didn't have words. All this power that I had, l thought I had as a writer. It was flushed down the drain. I was suffering from mental constipation. Obviously. I couldn't do any other work too. My publisher was angry. Because I was not doing the publicity properly. But then.. suddenly something started to happen. Something that was to make my life.. worst than ever. I call it the Preeti sighting. We all are here today.. What a film! And I want to thank everybody this morning for coming down. For your last respect to my mom and dad. And they will be happy to know that all their friends and family.. ..have turned down today to say goodbye. Dad used to say that he met mom during floods. And that there has to be a reason for it. Sorry. Again the day I was born, it was raining. There has to be a reason behind this too. The reason is to slug as fishes. Great! Just perfect! It was their last wish.. There you are in front of the woman.. ..you had been going crazy over the past week or so. And she is driving you crazy all over again. But I am not lying. I have actually maintained a record.. ..of the times that I have seen you. During daytime. At night. And mostly on Kingston Avenue. I work on Kingston Avenue. You must have seen me going to the office. Oh! That's a..! Sugar? - Two. The mystery is solved. But don't you think there is more to my visions? Tell me something. Do you wear funny dresses and go to office? What do you mean? I mean those funny skirts! Black, brown and all that! They are not funny. And are you mad? You are sitting with a girl for the first time. And you are making fun of her clothes. First. - First. First time. - First time. So Saturday is confirmed. You know, in all of England, you must be the only guy who.. ..calls a girl for a date at 1 0 in the morning. Good! I will take that for a yes! Where have you brought me, Rahul? What are we doing here? I used to think you are those disco type girls. But what to do in disco? No disco will be open so early in the morning. No. I didn't want to go to a disco. But.. Then? You are embarrassed! - No, I am not! Yes, you are! - No, I am not! Yes, you are! - No, I am not! It's simple. Say that you are a school teacher. Excuse me. 2 tickets please. She is a school teacher. And she is doing an assignment for the kids. Yeah! And I President Bush! I am here to give personal experience on social prejudice. This way! Actually the movie was not documented properly. - Is that so? Because what actually happened is that Shehzada Salim.. ..had met Anarkali again while hunting. - Yes. And then every year they started meeting again. And it was perfect love story. - Brilliant! Mind-blowing! A bit on the right. You only talk. - Why? If I say do something romantic to me. - Like? Bring stars for me. You will give a smart comment. Yes. We can't bring stars from the sky. But I can surely write about them. Did you see this? I knew it! Get off me! Fine! Fine! Okay! Okay! Get off! - Okay! Okay! This is what I will do tomorrow the first thing in the morning. I will bring stars for you. Do it again. So you have brought your girlfriend in your bedroom. I didn't bring you here thinking anything like this. But if that possibility is there then.. I don't mind. Mind? Now look.. bed covers too are clean. The couch too is comfortable. And the carpet too is there. Let's go. In life.. there can be no story more perfect than life. So? Thank you. So you too believe in romance. - How so? You only said that life is perfect. No, Mr. Rai. I said that life is a perfect story. Action.. drama.. etc, etc. Cheers. No, love. You are just not making an effort here. I just told you to attend a few parties. Meet some critics. Sign a few copies. But you did nothing. Absolutely nothing. What do you want me to do? Nothing. Just work out new endings of these two stories. That's it. Look.. I always heed your advice. So you have to accommodate me. I mean I have a business to run. If you will look at these previous one's sales figures.. ..you will get a heart attack. Right now I am very lucky to be alive. And you are very lucky I didn't sue you. Yeah! Right! - Yeah! Right! Stupid! Well, it wasn't Monday. I am sure about that. Thank you. Even if it was Tuesday, we really need to get started. Because there is not so much time left anymore. Did the figures come in? Yeah. That's great! Yeah. We really should. Yeah. Just.. give me a minute. Okay. What are you doing here? I was passing by. I thought I will check out your office. The interior is quite bad. This is my office. I am working here. Okay. We will meet in the evening. Actually.. I too had some work with you. - Is that so? Hi, dear. I don't believe we have met. Hi, beautiful! Francis, this is Rahul. Rahul, Francis. So that is Rahul. - And you must be Francis. Nice to meet you. - Heard a lot about you. Preeti never told me that you are so beautiful. Are you married? - I am. Yes. Sorry, honey. Nothing to be sorry about. That's enough, Casanova. That's what I keep telling her. - What? That each beautiful girl is marrying. So you too should marry. I am not bald. I am not old. And I look presentable enough. What do you say? Am I right? Did you just propose marriage to me? I guess I did. Francis, didn't I tell you? This man has no idea how to romance a woman. I mean none. Did she really tell you that? You go now. Okay! Go! He cooks for you everyday? Yes. That's the way it is. You are lucky. - I know. Here you go. Looks delicious! - Smells good too! Hope it is good too. I will take these! - Sure! Sure! Sure, man! You don't even read! Why do you need so many? Of course, I read! Don't you know? It's not my fault. When was the last time you read the newspaper? - Looks great! You don't even read the newspaper. - Let's go. Well, at least I don't pay on books.. ..I have no intention in reading. Look, will you just.. - Hey, Francis! You know the history behind chicken? It's quite fascinating! Guys! - Thank you! Kiss and tell! So.. been working on anything recently? Nothing much! Just my.. sex life. Ouch! What happened? Cheers! Mr. Rai, just think. You are sitting and while smoking.. ..you weave a beautiful dream about Princess Diana. And the lit cigarette falls on your pant. That is exactly what is happening. As if I was never a writer. This is bad. If even after 7 months, this is what you write.. What happened to you? Did you even read what you wrote? Even a 1 6 years old child can write this. Rahul! I am sorry. This is crap. Please take it back. And I will call you if something works out. What has happened to you? Damn it! Rahul! Come on, baby! It's no big deal! Everything will be fine. First venture out of the house. For the past 3-4 months, you are at home only. I mean.. go for an outing. And? - Flirt with me! I will try for a leave in the next month. We will go for an outing somewhere. Let's go to Goa! Say somewhere again. Somewhere. It's a beautiful place. Have you ever been to Goa? Y es. I have been there.. when I was in lndia. I couldn't go. Preeti didn't get a leave. Then time passed away. And we forgot about Goa plan. Excuse me. - Where are you going? Goa! I can do another thing. Yes. - I will stand on the road and beg in English. That too in lndia. Wearing such clothes. Just think! What a fantastic scene it will be! Why don't you look for a job, baby? Like what? - Do anything. Maybe just part time. Till the time nothing works out. What will I do? Nobody pays me even for Chicken Tikka! You can at least try. You know.. - Please! Please! Just for a month! Okay! Then you can leave it. Is that so? Fine. Where do I have to sign? Tell me. I love you! You are a man of secrets, Mr. Rai! It's Cuban! You should try everything in life. Absolutely! Don't worry, baby! Everything will be fine! You will do fine! My plight has never been so worst! The tie is so loose. Still I can't breathe properly. Now don't behave like a kid! Okay! What will I say there? Nothing. Just answer them. And if you can't think of anything.. then do one thing. Sing out Jack and Jill for them. You are joking? Now if you will behave like a child, then what can I do? Fine! I will handle it! Okay! I am sorry! Listen, just don't stress about it! Okay! It's not a matter of life and death. It's just a silly job. Remember. - Y eah! Right! I am Rahul. And I spoke to you about that job offer. Mr. Rai, now if I tell you.. Ieave your job. From today.. you perform puppet shows. You can't do that. Similarly 9-5 routine, weekends off.. ..paid leave.. I was not made for all these things. And the pressure of these things started affecting our marriage. Preeti tried a lot to build my confidence.. not to let me shatter. But.. again the same thing. Now I couldn't do puppet shows. Hello, Rahul! Is that you? Hello! Rahul! Hello! Thank you everybody for your patience! Thank you! Look, you don't have to work. Okay. Preeti.. I think we should have a baby. We should have a baby. Rahul the second.. or Preeti junior. Rahul.. now? Why? What happened? You know, I really want us to have a baby, right? But now? Now you can't be the mother of an unsuccessful writer's child. What's wrong with you? You know we can't afford a baby right now! I don't know when you will feel that we can afford a baby. Rahul. Its okay, Preeti! I don't want a baby! After that it was like lndia Vs Pakistan. Now I can understand what went wrong between us. What? Mr. Rai.. your eyes are very pale. Hello! Peter speaking! Hey! Peter! Hi! Preeti! How are you? I am fine! Listen, I have been trying Francis. Oh! Yeah! She has gone to her mom! She has not been keeping too well lately! Guess she will be away for a couple of days! So is everything okay? Yeah! Yeah! Everything is fine! Sure? Yeah! Tell you what? Why don't we meet this evening? Think we can talk? Well.. sure. That will be great! Hi! - Hi! Sorry, I am late! - lts okay! So how is Mrs. Hues? She is good! Yeah! Much better now! She said she will be back in a week's time. It's great! - Yeah. You look worked up. Is everything okay? And what happened? Nothing really! Its Rahul, isn't it? We have.. we have not been talking too much lately. He has a lot of things on his mind. So.. - Yeah. How long this has been going on for? You know, you don't have to put up with this. You know that, don't you? What do you mean? Look, you are a very attractive woman. And if he doesn't realise that.. then you should just move on. What! What are you talking about? A lot of men find you very attractive. And they would do anything to be with you. Peter, he is my husband. So what if he is your husband? It doesn't matter. He is just a sick writer. Hi! You are quite late. Yes. I.. had some work. What? I had some office work. This has never happened before in the past 1 year. So? What are you trying to say? Nothing. You should have at least informed me. Fine. I didn't tell you. Why do you have to make an issue out of it? Suddenly the good wife decides to come back home late. And has no explanation for it. Everything was fine for a year. Suddenly.. everything starts changing. Who is he? You had three hours. If you took a room in the vicinity of the office.. ..still you must have been with him for at least 1.5 hours. Tell me. You know everything, don't you? I want the details! Where did you book the room? Near my office. How is he? Is he better than me? - Obviously! Anyway. I am really exhausted. He was very wild. I had my dinner with him. You have your dinner. Happy Anniversary, Rahul! And then rest is history! She started sleeping with everybody. This is not fair! This is completely unfair! Don't you feel repulsive? Rahul.. in life things are not as simple as we make them. You are right. At times things are complicated. Even if things are not complicated.. ..we make them complicated. What if I say.. at times you don't get the chance. Nandini! Nandini! What are you doing? You will fall.. You woke up! What are you doing at this hour? Yesterday I saw dew drops in the garden. - So? I thought the season is changing. So I was taking out warm clothes for you and Amit. Mr. Rai! - Mrs. Boris. Good evening! Good evening! - Good evening! Would you please tell.. ..its quite late! And he has to go to school tomorrow. And he has homework still to do. Oh! Certainly! Would you like to come in for some coffee? Thank you! Maybe some other time! Its getting very late for Michael. Are you sure? - Yes. Okay! Hey! Your mom is waiting for you, Michael! Thank you, Mr. Rai! - lts okay! Mr. Rai! - Yes! - Mr. Rai! Now watch this! This is not the first time has applied this paint to my son's eyes! Oh! That's not paint actually! I mean it's not harmful! Thank God it isn't! But maybe you should tell your wife.. ..she shouldn't take such liberties with other people's children. Oh! I am really sorry! - I am sure you should be! This won't happen again! - I am sure it won't! I don't want you to go to that house again! Okay! Do you understand? And why didn't you.. I live in a mental hospital. Amidst rotted corpses. With ghosts. Mr. Rai.. is this 7 year itch problem? I mean if your wife is suffering from insomnia.. ..she likes children.. she likes to apply kohl in children's eyes.. ..then its not such a bad thing. For the past 1 5 years.. each year.. ..my son's birthday is celebrated in my house. There is veneration every three months. So? Nothing! He is dead! He was run over by a.. school bus 1 5 years ago. I am sorry. I really am. Can I ask you something? Your and Preeti's relationship is completely ruined. And you are young! Leave her! Even you are not so old, Mr. Rai. You can get any women that you want. It's not the question of women! I don't want women in my life. There must be something that you want to do. Yes. I too have as many possibilities as you have. Then leave your wife. Divorce her. Can't do that! If I divorced her then she will kill herself. And the society in which I live.. you don't know. Then you are enjoying your situation. Don't lie.. Sorry. Don't lie. Honestly.. I don't know.. ..whether I am telling the truth or not. But even I can't leave Preeti. All I can say is that sometimes you should listen to.. ..what the wind says and follow it. Mr. Rai.. I understand what you are saying.. ..what we both are saying.. is right. But we can't do anything about this. I am sorry, friend. I am not going to take this lying down. So what will you do? What would you do? We are talking about you, not me. We are talking about both of us. Our meeting is not a co-incidence. Even if it is.. then there is a purpose behind it. What? That we dissatisfied husbands will form a club? What if I say.. I can help you get rid of Preeti? I.. don't understand. Look, Rahul. We are strangers. We have met for the first time in this train. Apart from this.. we are strangers. So? Nandini is at home the whole day. All the neighbours go for work. You kill Nandini. And I will kill Preeti. That's the only way to change our lives. We just need a perfect plan. That's all. We will reach London after 4 hours. Are you with me? We are not doing anything wrong. This is the only way to claim our lives back. All the best. Ten years later, he said the same thing, how do you do. How do you do? It's our advocate's call. Hello. Yeah. Oh hi. Yes, Vinay. Not to press charges against the bus driver. I told you. What will I do with the compensation? Amit won't come back! Yes, please. You too will leave me! Please don't leave me! Please! Okay, okay. Okay. Amit! Amit! Tomorrow.. I have an official dinner. You too come. Is that so? Why? What happened? Actually.. tomorrow I have kept veneration for Amit. So veneration will take a long time. Is it okay if I don't come? Fine. If its possible for you to come.. then you too come. What happened? I have forgotten some papers. I will just come. At least finish your dinner. My breaths are smouldering. All my desires are aroused. My lips are smouldering. There is a new fragrance in my each fragment. My breaths are smouldering. All my desires are aroused. My lips are smouldering. There is a new fragrance in my each fragment. If you have no objection, can I sit here? Look.. I am in a hurry. It's okay. You have to wait for some things. Am I right? Let me guess, this is your first time here right. And you won't tell me your name till the time.. ..I don't ask you. Well in that case, forgive me for my manners. I am Sanjeev Das. Well I am Priety, and l hope you forgive mine. Thank You. You know, in a place like this if you leave your drink.. ..at the table, you generally never see it again. For in that matter, if you leave anything at the bar.. ..then you can forget it forever. Well in that case.. you must be leaving liberal tips. The waiters seem to be your fan. Actually.. many times I have done favours on them. When did you come here from lndia? Why? Indians don't do favours for each other. I thought lndian s believed in community living. Maybe that's why people can't live alone. Wow, Sanjeev! You are anti-establishment! How come you are here? That too alone! Did you have a fight with your wife? There was no need for that. My wife.. understands my need to be alone. No! This doesn't happen in marriages. When you are married, you tend to drink alone.. ..when you are bored with your partner. What do you do? Troubling people sitting alone. You are not troubling me. In fact.. I was troubled. But now.. I am all right. Sure. Sure. And what if I say, at this moment.. ..my husband is sitting somewhere in this restaurant.. ..at a table and watching us. Gotcha! I will just come. Preeti. Preeti, I don't think.. Preeti Preeti. Nowadays he drinks everyday. And then he follows me too. He thinks.. I sleep with every man I see. At times.. I stay out the whole night. Just because I know he is waiting. And today.. tonight l.. I actually thought I will do it. I thought I will be the person I am pretending to be. Preeti, what you are doing.. its very risky. Was your husband at the restaurant today? Maybe no. Today he was really drunk. Well in that case.. I got saved from being in his hit list. Look, Preeti. It's really late. I think you should go home. Here is my card. If you need anything, just call me. In fact.. if you just feel like talking then call me. Thank you. I am sorry, I don't carry business cards. The phone connection has been cut. I don't need it. If you need it, then pay the bill. I told you to pay the bill. Hello. Aren't you forgetting something? - What? That I am unemployed. Who doesn't earn? I. How will I pay the bill? Then why don't you earn? What is the need? You are there! You go out with so many men. You sleep with them. Don't you take money? Just for free? these purple night. Thank God they are well. These people look great from a distance. Am I also like these people? Not until now. Cheers to that Bottoms up. No - 1.. 2.. 3! Shit! Oops! Two glasses please. And a bottle of tequila. And a bottle of tequila. And I used to go fishing a lot. Amit and me. Your son! He was 6 years old. The bus driver was reversing. He didn't see Amit. He was a smart boy. Extremely naughty. Too smart boy. When did you come? - Just now. Are you tired? - No. I am fine. I was thinking let's go for a stroll. Yes. Come. - No. Let it be. No, no, it's fine! Come! - You go and change. No! I am fine! Let's go. - Okay. Are you feeling cold? - No. Remember.. once we had gone to Himanchal. - In '97. Yes. In '97. I had a habit of drinking too many teas there. Once strolling like this.. we were searching for a tea stall. We must have walked for 2.5 km. We didn't find any tea stall. And we both caught chill. We couldn't go anywhere else in the holidays. It has been so many years. What happened? Do you know them? No.. who are they? They recently had a child. And their child's pram is just like Amit's. Hello. Same time next year. What are you saying? There is a performance this evening. Yes. So are we going? You tell me. Pick my up at 5. Then we will have dinner outside. - Okay. Bye. - Okay. Listen.. carry an umbrella. - Why? No. Unlike boyfriends.. ..in London rains are not predictable. But if your boyfriend has a car.. ..then rains don't make any difference. Fantastic. So what time is it now? - My watch is on the table. No, it 3.25. I am going to get a cup of coffee. God knows what paths this life shows. These eyes had lost the brightness. Then I met you. And life has become beautiful. God knows what paths this life shows. So.. did you like the play? It was a great play But very less audience. Am I right? I guess that what happens to great plays. Without you, I felt something is lost. Whom should I have told.. what has happened. Without you there was such a dearth. What happened? - Nothing. Something is the matter. I don't like evenings very much. I don't like the light coming up. Why do people like evening so much? If evening didn't exist.. then even we couldn't have met. Isn't that something to look for award too? Honestly, that's the only thing I look forward to these days. I found you. And l found everything. I have found the reason for living. Now every moment smiles. Life seems so easy. Well.. thank you. Like always, the pleasure is entirely mine. I.. I will call you. Good night. - Good night. Hey, are you the messenger? Yeah, this is for you. - I guess so? Can you just sign here? - Yeah Thank you. 'Today in the morning I saw lovely roses.' 'l was afraid people will misunderstand.' 'So I am sending chocolates.' Hope you like them instead. If moon had recommended me. It would have given me fire. Forgoing shyness. I want to make a mistake. I want to destroy myself. Wife.. do you know? I have received an offer from South Hampton. The liked some of my scripts. Before I am in double mind.. I thought I will burn everything. How was your business trip? What business trip? I was in Goa with my boyfriend. Holiday. Beach. Why are you afraid? I won't beat you. If I killed you then.. with whom will l.. ..discuss the endings of my stories. You.. do something.. you.. go to sleep. You sleep upstairs. I.. will sleep down. Won't be more than half an hour. I won't be more than half an hour. So. You have nothing to say. What do you want me to say? What do you want me to do? Meet you tomorrow at 5.30 so you can say I love you. Then I go home. Is that what you want? Where are you going? Don't walk away from me? Now that you have had your fun.. ..are you going to walk away from me? You are nothing but a spineless, selfish coward.. ..and I never want to see you again! Listen to me. Wait! What should I do? What should I do? Kill Nandini! Kill Rahul! I don't care what you do, okay. I just want you to be honest with yourself. Either I live like a coward or a murderer! Pick your choice! Preeti! Preeti! Listen to me! I don't want to talk to you! Please come with me. I don't have anything to say to you, okay. I have something to say, please come with. Please. Please come with me. Please. I have decided.. that l won't live like a coward. We won't meet each other for a year. Gifts, photos, letters. Anything that connects us, destroy it. The court case will go on for at least 6 months. And till the time Rahul.. and Nandini are alive.. ..we are strangers for each other. After a year.. we will meet in Mauritius. After that where will we go, I don't know. Media, police.. no matter what the situation is.. ..you won't try to contact me. I just hope.. we.. you are able to hold your nerve. How will you meet Rahul? Send him for South Hampton meeting.. by train. I will meet him in the train. But.. the tickets will come in the records. What if somebody recognised you? Francis was saying there is a publishing house in South Hampton. They are looking for writes. See if you want to go. My name is wrongly written in this. Perry. It's okay. What's in the name! 'And you have still not told me your name.' 'There is no truth. Truth is what we believe in.' 'It's a beautiful place. Have you ever been to Goa?' 'Yes. I have been there.. when I was in lndia.' 'Your and Preeti's relationship is completely ruined.' 'Leave her!' 'l don't know.. whether I am telling the truth or not.' 'But even I can't leave Preeti.' All I can say is that, sometimes.. ..you should listen to what the wind says, and follow it.' 'Our meeting is not a co-incidence.' 'Even if it is.. then there is a purpose behind it.' 'What if I say.. I can help you get rid of Preeti?' 'Nandini is at home the whole day.' 'All the neighbours go for work.' 'You kill Nandini. And I will kill Preeti.' What happened? The cat died. The one that used to come here for food. I gave her milk this evening. And she died. I don't know what happened? Even if the milk gets spoiled still it doesn't become poisonous. Am I right? Rahul! When I was crossing the road.. ..a man almost ran his car over me! He didn't even stop to say sorry. He almost ran me over. What is going on, Rahul? Where have you been? Where were you the whole night? When I returned home there was no electricity! When I went in the kitchen searching for a candle.. ..the whole place was full of gas. All the burners were on! It can't be a mistake, Rahul. Rahul! Someone trying to kill me. We have got to call the police. Listen to me. Don't you see what's happening I know you don't love me. But I didn't know you hate me so much.. ..that you will want me dead! Rahul! Are you trying to kill me? No, it 3.25. 'You know my name.' 'Don't you know my name?' 'You got scared when you saw my luggage.' 'Thinking you are alone, you started sweating.' Are you scared of something? 'Reading your name I realized that.. ..this is going to be a journey of a lifetime.' 'Have you read this story before?' 'There is a thief in everybody's heart, am I right, Mr. Rai?' 'Where are you going? - Goa!' All the best. 'You are fooling me.' 'This one please, for my wife.' 'This is for me, it's so special.' 'Where did you get it made?' 'You like it, that's all that matters.' I will miss you! I will miss you! 'When I was young, there were times when I would.. ..close my eyes take a deep breath, and hold it. 'Wishing that everything around me.. ..would come to a stand still. ' could never hold my breath long enough.'
