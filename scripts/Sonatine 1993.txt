I'm not a yakuza, so I don't have to pay you anything. But you're acting like a yakuza. So let the police arrest me, but don't make me listen to your bullshit. You're dead, asshole. You're the stupid one. You are the stupid thing. Date? You've been waiting there half an hour. He's jilted you. I'm off soon, so why not come with me? We can go to a disco or something. The Don, Kitajima, called a few minutes ago. He said he'd call again. How did it go? Let's get him. I'll take it. It's the old man. Hello... yes... Today? I understand. Good to see you again, sir. I thought you decided to quit and go back home. The cafe owner needed a waiter so I figured I'd postpone the trip. Then start acting and dressing like a waiter. Yes, sir. If you screw me, I'll make you pay for it, punk. Sorry, sir. Off you go. Murakawa Media. It's for you, sir. It's Kishimoto. Yes. Katagiri speaking. Wait until October? - Tanaka can drive, can't he? - Yes, he can. You know the mahjong parlour, right? Yes. We told you we need it by August. - Go there and wait. I'll let you know. - Understood. "You can't"? Who do you think you're fucking talking to? I'll cut your balls off! You licked our fucking asses when you borrowed the cash. Don't fuck with us now! Ken, I'm thinking about retiring. We've been living the hard life too long. Yes. I'm tired of it. Maybe you're too rich for this business. Here they are. I hear their section's doing really well these days. The new underground means business on his patch is booming. Our area is lousy in comparison. Well, this new job might change our luck. So handle it carefully, okay? Nakamatsu's group in Okinawa has started a war against the Anan clan. They are begging for our help. So we've got to send some troops in. Murakawa, would you mind flying down there with some of the boys? Last time we were sent out to Hokkaido, three of my men got killed. I don't really feel like it. That's how you earned your current patch. Business is booming, isn't it? - Show the Don some appreciation. - Takahashi. Only if you go with me. You know my job. I've got to take care of the Boss: The syndicate operation. As much as I'd like to go with you... - Who's taking care of my patch? - You have a good lieutenant, Katagiri. Think about it, will you? There shouldn't be any bloodshed. You may smoke. Nakamatsu might be my sworn brother, but he's never done anything for me. He's merely a distant relative of our family. Unlike you lot. You're my immediate family. We've sworn allegiance and put our lives into your hands. Boss. You're putting my life into his hands, Takashi. There's a call for you, Mr. Murakawa. I'm going. Good night. Ladies, you may join us now. What d'you want? What's going on? Over there. You're evil, you know that? Mr. Murakawa, can we talk? Fuck off. Please. Be reasonable. How much do you want? Sorry, too late. Mr. Murakawa... How long can he last underwater? A couple of minutes, I guess. Let's try two minutes. Push him under. Mr. Murakawa, please, stop this. Mr. Murakawa, please stop this... Mr. Murakawa... Check him. Up. Mr. Murakawa! Still breathing, huh? Please, stop this. Try three minutes. Plunge him. Stop it, please! Stop it, please! Mr. Murakawa! Boss, there's something fishy about the Okinawa job. The old man says we need to put in an appearance and then they'll negotiate. Nothing's ever that simple. We lost three men in the Hokkaido job. It's over three minutes, isn't it? So it is. Hoist him up. Looks like he's dead. Oh well. Cover it up. Yes, sir. I'm Sakai. Honoured to meet you, sir. Okumura, sir. Hirose, sir. Ito, sir. I'll have some of my men join you later. You'd be happy if I dropped dead, right? Sure. I'd feel safe pissing again. Line up. State your names. Maeda, sir. Ohno, sir. Tsuda, sir. What are you doing here? Mr. Takahashi said he'd take me to Okinawa. Fuck, are we meant to work with this bunch of kids? - This is no kiddie's picnic! - Shut your fucking mouth! What's going on? I told you I quit using that stuff. Welcome to Okinawa, gentlemen. We'll take you to our office, now. Have some rest and the Boss will take you out to dinner, later. Hi, my name's Ryoji. I have some drinks and ice cream here, so if you want some, let me know. Shiraishi, let's go. Want something to drink? No. My stomach still hurts from where you stabbed me. What luxury, they're spoiling us. We haven't used this office for quite a while. It's a bit messy, but you won't be staying here for long, so I guess it's okay. The toilet is over there. Ryoji, bring the guns. Okay. I doubt you'll need these, but in case you feel lonely, take your pick. We conned these out of some Yanks, so I don't know if they're any good. What the fuck's that about? Just the Anan lot saying "hello". Often happens. But I'm sure there'll be a truce soon. What happens now? Our boss phoned the Anan clan a little while ago. Apparently your arrival's got them a bit excited. How many of you does it take to put a kettle on? Boss, I suppose we ought to return their greeting. Here I go. Well that was impressive. The fucking Yank sold me a dud again. Now what? It all started out with an idiot from our group shooting an Anan man. It's nothing serious, though. The other man didn't even die. So we didn't need any help. But your old man insisted on sending you across. I think he's overreacting. But thanks for coming anyway. We were told that you were desperate. That's news to me. Like I said, your old man insisted. It's really nothing serious. Just one of those little problems we encounter every day. Not an inter-clan thing or anything. What are your plans for tonight? Mr. Uechi said he'd take us out. What part of Tokyo are you from? Nakano. Then you know Tommy's, by the station? Never heard of it. It's quite a well-known joint. Didn't you hear me? Smoke? What's that? Marijuana. I don't do drugs, I only do amphetamines. - Are you feeling okay? - I'm fine. Got a cigarette? Boss, we'd better split up into smaller groups from now on. And let anyone who wants to go, go back to Tokyo. They're not playing games here. Good evening. Wouldn't you be more comfortable in a booth? No. - What would you like? - Beer. I'll call some hostesses, okay? This is Tomiko. Send some girls over. Send Marie and June, we're getting busy. Maybe you know my friend, Kinjo? He's from Nakano. Huh? He robbed a supermarket and barricaded himself inside. Never heard of him. What about Nanbara, the gang rider? Haven't you got any respectable friends? A baseball star from high school or someone like that? More beer! Good evening. What shall we have, beer? Yes, beer. No, scotch and water. Let's order. All clear. This is my brother's house, but he moved to Osaka last month. Nobody should bother us here. I'll call Tokyo from the shop. Call about what? Just to tell them we're going to hang out here and see how things develop. Beer and sake, nothing else? No. You'd better shoot straight. Aim at the can. You almost got me, dickhead! I felt it brush my cheek. Give me the gun. Let's play. - Play what, sir? - Paper, scissors, stone. You too. You lost. What are you playing at? You could've killed me. Next round. Come on. Paper, scissors, stone. You again? Wait a second, please. Next round. It's the last chamber. Right. So, here we go... Paper, scissors, stone. This time, you lost. Me? Don't do it, please! What's the idea? It was empty all along. Watch your mouth, asshole. You were shitting yourself. Something funny? Dance with me. Some other time. Hey! You've been watching us all this time? You a pervert? Like watching others fuck? Answer me, asshole. You're dead. I mean it. I'll slit your throat. I didn't mean it... You really think that girl killed him? Two shots in the stomach. - Shall we dump him in the sea? - Okay. What about the car? We'll use it. Watch your speed, asshole. Your friend is here. How is the Boss? Still talking about a truce all the time. I just don't understand him. Here are some fresh clothes. Nothing fancy, though. Thanks. Call me when you need me. Just a second. Would you mind handing this to Marimo at the bar "Chez Moi?" What is it? Just a present. I'm not your messenger boy. Just do it as a favour, will you? There's some more clothes over here. I won! Okay then... here comes my favourite. Who's this then? Mai-no-umi. (Note: Famous wrestler) Katagiri, isn't that shirt a bit loud? - Doesn't it suit me? - You look absolutely terrible. Do you mind if I visit you here again? Don't bother. Why do I have to drive you home? I'm an awful driver. I don't mind. I do! This is my husband's car after all. What do you mean by that? When was your first kill? When I was at high school. Who was it? My dad. Why? He wouldn't let me fuck. You sit in front. How can you crash on such a wide road? A snake shot out. You don't have a driving license, do you? She was driving. That's not true. Give it a push. Are you sure you can make it back in one piece? I'm sure. Remember to fill it up - with your own money. Watch out, there's a hole there. Come to this side. They're on their way. Over here! Quick! What's going on? I'll explain later. Quickly! Let's go and have a drink. Boss, isn't it a bit childish? What else is there to do? You still wearing that shirt? It really looks terrible on you. Let's go. - There're no more traps! - You're sure? Where's that water? This is the last of it... How are we meant to take a bath? Just wait until it rains. Where's the Boss? He went fishing. With that bird. She's here again? I guess she's in love. Don't you like that shirt anymore? None of your damn business, asshole! It's great not to be afraid of shooting people. Not being afraid of killing people means you're not afraid of dying yourself, right? You're tough. I love tough guys. I wouldn't carry a gun if I were tough. But you can shoot without a second thought. Because I get scared fast. But you're not afraid of dying, are you? When you're scared all the time, you reach a point when you wish you were dead. I don't get it. What are your plans now? No word from Tokyo... so we'll probably head off home in a couple of days. Fuck me, darling. You fuck off! Hey motherfucker, you screwed my girl. I'll break your fucking neck. Will you shut up, dickhead? Kiss. It's raining! Thank God! Get the shampoo! It's great not to be afraid of showing your tits! That's all? The fuck do we do now? Ready? Action! No good! Start again. You've got to come out slowly. Once more. Action! What are you playing at? Call that dancing? You've got to enjoy yourself! I'll dance with you. Once more! I want to talk to Takahashi. He's always "out". He'd better be there next time. Understood? Hey. What happened to the change? Did you put money in? You think I'm a fucking beggar or something? Of course I put the fucking money in! Is your phone a piggy bank?! Next time it happens, you're dead! Ouch! Ow, that's hot! Who's using the gun? That's over the top. Stop shooting at us! - Where's Mr. Murakawa? - He's gone off again. - My boss wants to see him now. - About what? - Maybe about the truce. - I'll go then. Your boss's aide, Takahashi, came to see me yesterday. He's been finalising the truce with the Anan clan. That's good news. There's one condition... Anan wants us to disband. What was your answer? I told him that was out of question, and sent him home. But, Uechi... I'm thinking about retiring. I'm old and there's a baby on the way. So I want you to take over my patch. You decide whether to disband or to fight them. Did Takahashi say anything about us? The Murakawa section will apparently be eliminated. I see. Missed every one! What d'you expect? There's no way you can hit it! I'm not Buffalo Bill, asshole. You try, you fucker! - I'll tell you when to throw, okay? - Okay. Aim over here, okay? Ready? Now! Shit! No more bullets! You're fucking impressive too! We'll squeeze Takahashi until he squeals. The Boss has got no options left anyway. Mr. Uechi., you go in front. What is it? Is Mr. Takahashi there? My name's Takashi... Must be a mistake. Should have known he wouldn't register in his own name. Takahashi. I swear I know nothing. Our boss always wanted to work with the Anan group. He had to get rid of his relative Nakamatsu first. The argument was the perfect excuse... for him to eliminate Nakamatsu. So why expel me? Your patch is doing great business. He's greedy. Listen Murakawa... The Boss is coming to Okinawa to see Anan. You could take over Nakamatsu's patch. I can arrange it. You want a go? Not that. How do we get back now you've destroyed our car? Sorry. Who are you? Sorry, I got lost. Are you coming back? Maybe... You'll be here? Maybe... Can I have a go with it? Go ahead. I'm going with you. Forget it... You're going straight soon. Fuck you. In ten minutes, the lights go out. Remember to fill her up on your way back.
