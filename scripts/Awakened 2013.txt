I'll see if he's still seeing people. Mrs. Johansen, you can go in now. Ms. Winston. Ms. Winston! - Hi. - Mr Drake will see you now if you'll follow me. - Okay. I can't believe my eyes. Samantha Winston. Hi. Well, come in. Sit down. Please. I can't believe you'd remembered me. - Samantha, how are you? - I'm fine. - Where're you staying? - Motel. - Mm..huh. You know, I tried to reach you over the years - few times. But they told me that you moved to Minnesota with your aunt. Yeah... So what are you doing here? - I need a job, Mr. Drake. - A job? - Harriet? - Yes. Would you please set up a new desk for Ms. Winston outside my office. I'm gonna put her in charge of handling new client accounts. - Yes. - Thank you. - Can you start tomorrow? - Yeah. Thank you. Okay, Harriet will show you how to do the job. It's really straight forward. There's a lot of paperwork. That way you don't get involved with the other aspects of this business. I don't mean to sound morbid, but we're doing really well. We operate 31 facilities up and down the east coast. - It's great, Mr. Drake. - Actually, I'm not Mr. Drake. That was my father. I'm Lucas. You call me Lucas, okay? Mams, I'll get Jack for this. Jack! Daddy! Who are you? What do you want? Is it ... Is Samantha? Samantha! Dear God, Sammy, is that you? Sweetie, I've looked for you. I just... I'm sorry. I just... I searched for you after Patricia died... - Why didn't you find me? - Well, you were eight... - Eight and a half. And halfway across the country. You were with a family and... better than a drunk like me. So sweetie, please, let's go inside. We can't talk out here. Please. Come on in, I've got milk and cookies. Here, come on and sit down. Feel free to walk around, if you want. Look at the house. If you want to look at those pictures or go upstairs... yeah. They're really beautiful pictures. Your ma was a beautiful woman. I'm sorry, she's gone. She loved you very much. Ah. Here we go. Yeah. Go ahead. Okay. Here... Here. Sit down, sit down. Eat. Your mama would kill me if I didn't feed you. Remember how worried she used to get? Here. We have so much to talk about. I wish you could stay, Sammy. I don't drink anymore. I try to do good things for people. I'd love to make it up to you, if you'll let me. - How is your health? - Oh, I'm clean. I haven't had a drink for years, I don't even want to smell the stuff. What about you? Where have you been all this time? I stayed with a few foster families, after Aunt Patricia died. They didn't like me very much, so that didn't work out. When I was 16, I ran. I'm here now. - I'm tired. - Well, you know. Let me show you your room. Your room, sweetheart, just as you left it. - It's getting late, I'm gonna have to go. - You're going? So soon? - I just wanted to see the old house. I'm not staying here. - Maybe you could stay for a cup of tea? Fine. - You like oranges, huh? - Not really. Hey, I wonder... you know. Maybe I could make you some eggs? I've got this... this new pot. I just got. Just like the ones on TV. I... Guess what I want to say is I really want you to stay. Sammy, even if it's just for a couple of days. I don't want any food. I guess I'll stay for a couple of days. Okay. I... er... you know I have some clean pajamas for you, if you want. I left my stuff at the motel, I don't need pajamas. You tell me about mama tomorrow. I don't remember much. Your mama loved you very much. We can talk about it, I promise. I'll leave the key by the door downstairs. Would you like me to turn the hall light off? - I'm fine, goodnight. - Okay, good night. Jack? Jack, is that you? - Hey. - Hey! - How's your first day going? - Great. Good. You know I have a guest house that you could stay in. - If it will make you more comfortable. - But I'm at Jack's. - Jack? Okay. - Yeah, he caught me looking through the window. - So I'm staying there for a few days. - Okay. Do you want to come up for dinner tonight, with my family? I'll try and help you remember about Jen. - Oh, that'll be great. - Oh, and I've got something for you. This is your first very own work mobile phone. Oh. Alright. Use it wisely. - I really enjoyed meeting your daughter and son. - Well, they really like you. I know this because Tatiana never invite anybody into her bedroom. - Oh, where is your wife? She coming home? - No, we're divorced. She lives in France with her new billionaire husband. You know the kids are actually adopted. We both love them like crazy. But... they speak French now, cause they live both back and forth. - Okay. - Yeah, it's good for them. Hey, I want to ask you something, and don't get mad at me. I'm just... The old house you're staying in,you want to stay there? I don't think it's a great place for you right now, maybe. Yeah, It's fine. Yeah. You probably don't remember it cause you were a little girl, but I knew your mom really well. We were really... really close friends. And I really cared about her. And she was really an unhappy person. But she lived for you. She adored you. Yeah, I remember how mom used to smile when you were with us. - I never forgot you. - Really? Ah, how about that? Ah, hear? You hear Tatiana? She's quite a musician. Yeah, really. I'm gonna sing you a song that she and I wrote together. Hey. We're writing it now. She... sort of came up with the melody, and the words are mine. And the whistling is mine. It's a lullaby. - Should I stop? - Can I go upstairs and say goodnight to Tatiana? Yes, you should do that, or else she'd never go to sleep. - Titiana, I had a great time with you and your dad. - Me too. Are you coming to stay? I have to go home. Mmm, I like that teddy bear, it's cute. - Do you live in Bayport with mom and dad? - I live with my father right now. - And your mom? - No. Where is your mother? She's in... er... She's in heaven. - Do you miss her? - Every day. Ah... did you invite Samantha to my birthday party yet? Samantha, it would be great if you could come. It's supposed to be really cool. - God, that sounds great, how old are you gonna be? - 14. Okay, you two, I have to go home and get some sleep. - Samantha, come back soon. Okay? - Okay. You're a good daddy. - They're very happy kids. - Well, I hope so. And you, Sam, are you happy? Well, at least, did you enjoy dinner? I think he killed her. Jack. I think he killed my mom. I came here to find out the truth, I searched the internet, I can't find anything. Honestly, there have been times when I wanted to kill Jack. But I just didn't have any proof. So just let go. - We must to let go. - Let it go? Let it go? Lucas, I can't even sleep. And when I do, I have these dreams. And I see her, and I'm gonna reach out for her. - And then she's gone. - Okay, honey, honey, just breathe, you have to breathe. I'm gonna... I'll get you some water, some cold water. Okay. Okay. Okay. Shh. Stay calm. Hey, hey, alright. Come on, come on I got your water. Alright, just sit right there and I'll give you a little water. Here, sip. There you go. Breathe. - Better? - Yeah, yeah, better. Sorry, I get shaky sometimes. - I don't know why. - It's okay. Do you want to talk about your aunt Patricia? You know I never really knew her. Ah yeah. She was uh... brillaint. She never really had anyone. She missed my mom too. And... er... she was really the only person who understood me. It was a car accident. And the police come to my school to pick me up. They bring me to the hospital. I stayed by her side, and I begged her not to die. But... she did. I felt my whole life taken from me all over again. But she hated my dad. Jack is much older than your mom. And he always felt like he wasn't good enough for her. But I always felt that he was harmless, it was just all talk. I never believed in any way that he was involved in her so-called accident. Accident? Okay, okay, okay. The story is that she hit her head on the bathtub. Sam, baby. And Dr. Kaplan came and he tried to revive her. That's where he found her. I never knew the details. Nobody did. But your aunt, Patricia, she was sure that it was your father did it. - The cremation was quick. - She was cremated? Yeah, it was a quick viewing and the cremation. - I guess you didn't know that. - No, I did not know that. Look, where can I find Dr. Kaplan? Woh, last I heard he was in a nursing home... with dementia. Sam... Sam! Hey Sam! But wait. Wouldn't the doctor know the truth? I mean wouldn't he know if there were foul play? Sam, Dr. Kaplan pronounced her dead in the bathtub. I mean this man was the coroner in this town for 30 years, well respected... and he was absolutely sure that your mom had been dead quite a while. - And? - And Jack was drunk all the time. He was drunk that night. So really, nobody knows what the hell happened. - She died in the bathtub? - Yes. No... no, I remember... My mother was in bed when she died. When the dictor said she was gone, she was in bed. - I may have been young, but I remember... - No, no, no, you're wrong. You don't know anything about that night. I'm telling you. You don't. Jack? Thought I heard you come in. I made dinner for you, I was kind of hoping that you will come home. I had dinner with my boss and his family tonight. Hey, are the windows secure? I'll check for you. Boss? I didn't know you had a job here. Yeah. I work for Lucas Drake. Lucas Drake? Competitor, our enemy. Oh, sweetie, my God, that thief! He... he's a fraud, he even ran for Senator. I mean you sold the funeral firm more than ten years ago and I needed a job. Huh... sure. Sure. Of course, honey. Really pretty pajamas. I was just worried about you. You know, being out in the dark, so late. Yeah, I'm tired and I want to go to bed. - Good night, baby. - Good night. Sleep tight. Love you. Hey? Hey! - Hello, can I help you? - Yeah, we gonna see Mr. Drake. - He knows we are coming. - I'm sorry. What are your names? Good morning, I'm Benny Dawson. This is my nephew, Liam, and you are? - I'm Samantha. - Samantha. It's nice to meet you. - I'll let Mr. Drake know that you're here. - You do that. He's expecting us. Gentlemen. Good morning. And good morning to you. Who's driving? I'm not driving. - I'm going for lunch. - Oh, er... you have an appointment with the Rodrigues family in 20 minutes. - You handle it. Okay? I apologise if we upset your schedule too much. - Lucas, maybe Samantha would like to join us? - No, no, no, she's got a lot of work to do. - Would you? - Come on, I'm hungry. - Okay, that's fine, next time. How about we shake on it? Benny, let's go. Come on, Uncle Benny. Let's go. I never lost faith that someday you would come looking for me. And you did. What happened to the mama? You don't remember anything? Only her beautiful soft skin, her hugs. And being here again, I could smell her scent sometimes. That's it. How did she die? The doctor said the mother had stomach cramps and high fever. It... It was like a miscarriage. - Mom was pregnant? - Yes, baby, she was. - Oh, how far along was she? - I don't know. How would you not know? I was different then, Sammy. Listen, you can ask me anything you want about your mama... but please, please don't talk to anyone out there about this. Okay? There were some kind of bad complications with the pregnancy. I was too drunk to help. You're destroying this family! You're destroying this family! Was it Dr. Kaplan who told you about mama's complications and miscarriage? I don't feel well, Sammy. I have to go to bed. Bet you will. Erm... Mr Drake isn't in today. No... I'm... I'm actually here to see you. - Me? - Yeah, you wanna grab an early dinner? I mean... it's literally right down the street. - I'm sorry, what's your name again? - Liam Dawson. Well, then... Hey, Mr. Dawson, let me get my coat. My uncle's got great Italian food for an Irishmen. So, Samantha, tell me... I mean why you're working in such a depressing place. - I'm on a mission. - A mission? My mother was Jennifer Winston. She died here 14 years ago. - I'm here to find out how. - It's pretty profound. - Turn anything up yet, I mean any leads? - No, nothing really. - Did you ever meet my mother? - No, I... er... I didn't live here back then. - I think everyone has their own story of events. - No, no, I was out west. Salute. To your mission. I tell you what, if you need help with anything... I mean anything, you just let me know. - I mean, I know people. - You know people? - What do you mean? What do you do exactly? - What I need done. I'm kidding, I'm a lawyer. I do paperwork. I answer phone calls. Well, I might need your help in the future, but it'll have to be a secret. Really, let me know. Anything I can do, I'll help. - Why would you wanna help me? - Because I like you, Samantha Winston. Sammy, are you home? I'll be right down. - How was church tonight? - Oh, it was good, it was very good. I wish you would come with me some time. - Might make you feel better. - I felt fine. - Sure. I guess I just wanted you to come with me. Just so we can spend some... some quality time together. And talk... after all these years. - I'm really tired, I want to go to bed. - Of course, I'm tired too. Good night. Forgive me, Jen. - Forgive me! - What does he do? Oh my God! - Who are you? - Samantha, I know you, you have to leave this town. They're going to kill you! Run! Go! Baby! Thank you, thank you Mr. Lopez. Alright. Bye-bye. It's a shame you weren't here but Mayor Lopez made this town what it is today. - How does Lucas deal with such sadness everyday? - Well, he's amazing. I've working here for over 20 years and he's a real hero. He's always been a good boy. Did you know my mother? Yes, your mom. She was wonderful. - How did you know her? - Well, she came here rather often. And sometimes we'd have lunch and we would chat. - You didn't mention that. - Well, I didn't think it was necessary. - You didn't think it was necessary? - Look dear, your mother had big problems. Her mother and father were gone, her sister lived so far away, her brother couldn't help her. Wait, her brother? My mother didn't have a brother. - Yes, dear, Thomas was her younger brother. - Thomas? - Oh, where is he now? - Well, I've heard that he's in a rest home somewhere. - Okay. Listen honey, he didn't attend your mom's funeral. He had mental problems. She would visit him almost everyday. Even on the day she died. - What do you know about the day my mother died? - well, that was a long time ago, dear. I remember she phoned here that day. She sounded upset. She didn't feel well and she insisted Lucas stop by. I told her that I would tell him... Huh... sometimes bad things happen to good people, I suppose. Ladies... am I interrupting something? Oh... er... I was just leaving to get ready for the meeting. - Sam, you're all right? - Lucas, I'll prepare the files for the meeting and they'll be on your desk first thing... That's fine, just go, Harriet, I'll talk to you later. She's not been herself lately. She's old and we have you. - And she's afraid of losing her job. - I'm not going to take Harriet's job. I don't even know how long I'll be staying here. Hey, have you spoken with Mr. Lopez about the flower arrangement? Why didn't you ever mention that I had an uncle? Because there's nothing to tell. Look, I didn't even know that that was really your mom's brother. It... It... your mother used to take in strays. She had a big heart. - Just forget it. - Forget it? Honestly, your mother didn't like talking about him. She had you and your dad to take care of. It's a lot. Lucas, I asked you to be honest with me. Yes... - I heard that you had lunch with Liam Dawson the other day. - Yeah, he's nice. No, no, you can't get close to them. It's not good for you. - Why? - Him or his uncle. - It was Liam, not his uncle. - You just have to trust me on this, Sam. No, I don't have to trust you. I mean you just forgot to mention that my mother had a brother or a Thomas. And... and now you're telling me who I can eat with? - Baby girl... - I made you soup. - You're always tired. - Come on, honey, we got to go. - No, Jen! Please! Please! Come on, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I love you. Okay, okay, okay, listen. You're upset. I apologise for not mentioning Thomas. I just didn't... I didn't think... I didn't want you... Let's start over. I promise to be completely honest with you... if you'll forgive me. If we start now? So where is Thomas? And is he really my uncle? I don't know, let's take a walk and we'll talk about it. Come on. Come on, it'll be good for you. - It's freezing to death. - No, Lucas, I'm fine. No, no, no, I know you're all grown up and everything, but you're no good to me if you froze. Okay? First of all... Thomas. I really believe that he's dead. About a week after your mom passed away... - I heard that he took his own life. He just... he couldn't see any point in going on. He just kind of stop existing. God. It's okay, Lucas, I miss her too. Yeah, we all miss her. We all do. Thank you for telling me about Thomas. But... you know Liam is very nice to me. Samantha, Liam is very nice, and I'm sure he's fun and everything. But his Uncle Benny is my business associate. But his favours come with a price. And I'm not ready to have you go there. Okay? Okay. - It's getting late. You should go. - Wait. You gonna come to dinner? I can't. I have errands to run. - But do you need me to come in tomorrow? - Tomorrow's Saturday. No, you have fun. - But I still like to come to dinner with your kids anytime. - Yeah, you could come anytime. You're always welcome. Feel better? Okay. Thank you. Okay, go home. Mama... I thought I could figure this out. I really did. I need answers. There's nothing in here. Coming. Hello? Hello? Hello? Liam! - How did you get in here? - The door was open. Thank you. Wasn't expecting anyone. - Erm... do you want to have a seat? Want to have coffee? - Sure. - Cream or sugar? - Er... black is fine. Here you go. I'm a mess. I'm gonna go freshen up in the bathroom. Okay, I'll be right back. Sam, look, I like you. Maybe too much. I don't get that. How do you like someone too much? I don't know. I've got big plans. I just... I always thought that getting attached with someone will get in the way of that. I've got big plans too. Oh yeah? What are they? Seriously, we're partners, right? What are... what are your plans? Partners, Liam? I barely know you. Seriously, I barely know you. I just know that you and Benny are business partners with Lucas. Yeah. What's with all the questions? What are you doing, exactly like, for them? Well, I... er... my dad died when I was nine. Erm... he left me and my mom with basically nothing. My mom had to clean houses and stuff to make ends meet. And, you know, Uncle Benny was my dad's youngest brother, but he paid for all the funeral expenses. And he kept calling and offering assistance. My mother kept saying no and I worked to put myself through school. And... er... when I graduated, Uncle Benny was there. And... he...er... he offered to pay for law school for me and I accepted. And he kept sending money to my mother, and now she's the belle in Manhattan. I-I-I mean I wouldn't have anything if it wasn't for that guy so... Yeah, I'm sure that you'd have done a lot more for your mom than Benny has. - You're a good guy. - Maybe. Liam, has your uncle ever mentioned anything about my mom? What? No. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Oh my God, my father Jack. He's come home! Hurry, get out! Go! Oh, hey. - Are you all right? - Ooh yeah, I was sleeping. - Was there somebody here? - No. Oh, I'm tired, I'm going to bed. Are you alright? Yeah, I was just gonna... the door got stuck. I'm sorry I woke you up. I just haven't been able to sleep lately. Why haven't you been able to sleep, baby? I don't know; this place, this town. All I could think about is mama. I think about your mom all the time. I loved her very much. She was a wonderful woman. This is different, I see her. And I dream of her, and the dreams are bad! You shouldn't be having bad dreams. I'm the one that should be having bad dreams. Not you, you shouldn't have any bad memories about your mother. Well, I don't know whether the dreams are unreal or fantasy... - but they all end in the same way. And mom is always... You can tell me. Mom was always being hurt by you. I even had a dream about the day mama died. And the doctor was there and he said that she was gone. She was just gone. I wasn't able to save your mom. And I lost you once, but I don't want to lose you again. Before I became a drunk, I was a successful man. I bought your mom this wedding ring and I've been waiting... - hoping you'll find me, so I can give this to you. Sweetheart, I was lost. Just like you. Then I found my faith in the Lord. I wish it was that easy to say some prayer and everything would be fine. Is it really the best you could do? Everybody has to find their own path. You'll find yours. Sweetheart, I love you. Good night. Hello? Hi, Liam. No, I can't, I... I have to go to church with my father. Tomorrow I'm working. I... I gotta go. Okay, bye. - May I help you? - Hi. I'm here to see Thomas Burton. I'm Samantha Winston, his niece. Hello, I'm Dr. Rockwell. I've been caring for your uncle. And he's really not up to seeing anyone. I only need to see him for a minute. He's out in the back. Come. How are you today, Thomas? Thomas. you have a visitor. Your niece, Samantha Winston, is here to see you. Hi. Jen! Jen! Oh my God... Jen. I'm Samantha, Jennifer's daughter. Oh, baby. Baby girl. I need to know what happened to mama. Do you know how she died? They killed her. Who? They killed - - my sweet- - sister. And you know what? They're gonna kill you. They will. They're gonna kill you. They're gonna cut you out. - Who is gonna kill me? - Thomas, be calm. Ms. Winston, Ms. Winston, he's not feeling well. You could come back later. - I'll be back, I promise. - No! No! You listen to me! You listen to me, please. - Thomas. - Don't trust anyone. Okay, listen, especially Lucas. Do you hear me? Yes. You do? - Ms. Winston... you could come back. You could come back another time. - I'll be back. I'll be back, I promise. No, come on, sit. I don't want to sound like a father or something, but you sure you're alright? - I don't know. - What? What's going on? I told Jack about my dreams, that I was worried about them. - And? - Hs said I should go to church. I don't think that's really gonna help. I mean the dreams are getting worse, I can't even sleep. I think it's time you see a doctor. Well, maybe, I guess. I don't see how a doctor could fix me either? - I'm beginning to think I can't be fixed. - Sam, I have the perfect person for you to see. - I can get you an appointment first thing Monday morning. - Okay. What kind of doctor? A psychiatrist. What? You think I'm crazy, don't you? - Wait! - This was a bad idea. I'm going. Leave me alone. Liam... Liam Dawson is not the person to help you. Sam, come on. Sit on the couch. Listen, listen to me. Please, you're safe here, I'm on your side. We're gonna work this out. You need to calm down. You just... you need to calm down and relax. Remember you're safe here. I'm on your side. I'm your friend. I'll be here shortly. Honey, keep breathing. Everything's gonna be alright. Alright, I'm right over here. Here. Okay. Look. Nice and cool. It's okay. Good. Good. Swallow, relax. Relax. You're all wound up. You need to calm down. Look, you can even put your head down for a little but, okay? It's nice and soft. Here, you go, honey. Here, kick your shoes off. Here we go. Okay. Get really comfortable. You don't have to think about anything. You're so beautiful. You look just like your mom. Just like your mommy. Relax. I love you so much. I love you so much. Jen, I've always loved you. I'll always, always love you. Lucas, I'm not my mother. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know. I'm sorry. I know that. You just rest, okay? I'm gonna go out for a little while. I'm gonna go out and you just stay here and just relax. Okay, you're safe here. Okay? I'll be back. - Benny. - What're you doing? - Shhh. Come, you know why I'm here. - No, I don't. What's up? - Why's she working for you? - Because she needed a job. I see. So you think it's smart having her around? It's very impressive Lucas. You land all the prized jewels, every single one of them. Last year it was a movie star. This year it is our own very dear Mayor Maria Lopez. You're like the king of the dead. You... er... You putting her for the big day? Hey, don't! Touch her! You never should have lost that election. That was a golden opportunity. I had you primed for a perfect run in the Senate seat. You lost a truck load of my money, you asshole. I know you can't hear too good. Is it the right ear or the left. I forgot. So I'm gonna ask you one more time. - Why's she working for you? - To keep an eye on her. You never learn, do you? You never learn. What is it with you and that family? You knew this was risky. If she wants... if she wants answers, maybe I should just fill her in myself. No, no, you stay away from her. Listen, you always had it wrong about me and Jennifer. Always. Don't you ever forget who made you king. Why is it that you live in a mansion, and why your beautiful innocent children go to private school. - Yeah. Well, I never asked for that, Benny. - Yes, you did. And if you would have done just as you were told, everything would have been fine. But you had to fall in love with your little whore. She wasn't a whore. Don't ever say that again. You're so emotional, how many times have I to teach you it's not personal. It's always business. - Can I help you? - Hi, is this the home of Dr. Kaplan? - Yes, it is. - Hi, I'm Samantha Winston. - I just need to see the doctor for a minute. - The doctor is elderly. He had a stroke and cannot speak. - Please... please. - He sees no one. What's the matter with you? - Listen. What's the matter with you? - I'm bored, man. I came in for some booze. - Want to tell me how your date went? I'm dying to hear. - It wasn't much of a date. We came here, had dinner, had some wine. - Then it got weird. - How do you mean weird? Well, we're gonna know each other and all... And... er... before I know it... - You know. Things were going good. - Ah, it doesn't sound so weird. She asked me if you ever mentioned her mom. - She said what? - Yeah, I know. And... and then she just shoo-ed me out the back door. I called in the morning and... - She pretended like she didn't even know who I was. - I don't understand why she would question about her mother. Did you bring it up? No, that's what made it so weird. - Liam, I... er... I need a favor. - Of course Uncle Benny, anything for you. There are some things that you need to know. Things that never ever leave this room. Nothing you tell me is ever repeated. It's that girl that you're seeing, she's trouble. - Samantha? - I'm only gonna say this once. One time. I don't know how else to put this but she could destroy this entire town. How could Samantha Winston destroy a town? Remember when you graduated and came here to visit? It was about 13, 14 years ago. Well, it started happening. It started all over again. - I don't understand. - That family... it's like they cursed this whole town. You see years ago, Lucas was headed for the Senate with my money. He had a very promising political career, and then that whore... she... Anyway, I fixed it because that's what I do. I fixed it. I fixed it and I took care of it. - Fixed it? - Yes, I fixed it. What part of this girl is trouble do you not understand? She's a threat to everything, your nice house, your mother's townhouse, everything. - I don't understand. - I don't need you to understand. I need you to listen. I need you to find out everything and I mean everything that she has discovered. Let that sit in there. Why don't you finish my wine while you're at it. Baby. Baby. - Your baby. - What? My baby, your baby. What? - Hi, good morning. - Morning. Would you like some eggs? I... er... I have some errands to do. Well, cause then there's the wake later today. Well yeah, I guess everyone's gonna be at Mayor Lopez's wake today. I'll just have coffee. And these cookies look good too. You always loved chocolate chip cookies. And you always loved clamchowder soup, daddy. I said I gotta go do errands, but... er... I'll be back. Jack, I figured handling the service was the least I could do Lucas Mama? - Not too close to the altar. - Yes, there are two viewings of Mary Lopez today. Yes, we are expecting a large turnout. Thank you. You look good. Thank you. Come on. Too late. You're lucky... you have a job here! - Answer the phone! - You've never been the same since Jennifer's death. - Stop it! Look, I saved you with Jennifer, I'm not saving you again with Samantha. You don't have to take care of Samantha and Thomas, your little games are gonna end soon. Benny line two. Listen Benny, I can't do this right now. No, you stay away from her. I'll take care of this. Hey, I'm here to see Thomas Burton. - I'm sorry. There's no Thomas here. - What? I was just here yesterday, remember? - A doctor took me to his room. - I've never seen you before, miss. We only have 20 residents here. I'd know if there was a Thomas. Look, I spoke with you yesterday. Doctor, doctor, I was here yesterday. I really need to see my uncle Thomas. Thomas Burton. - There is no Thomas here in this residence. - He was here yesterday, I saw him. - There is no Thomas here. - I saw him yesterday. My little Thomas. Are you okay? - Please come with us. - What is this? - Please come with us. I saw my Thomas, he was here yesterday. I saw him yesterday. I saw him. - There's a line around the block. - As expected. Such a turnout for her memorial. These are her cousins, Chantelle and Carol. - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - Lucas had to step out. - Is everything alright? He's handling a personal matter. We'll take care of everything. Mr Benny, I've made the rounds. Everything seems to be alright. You look good, new suit, and you lost weight. - No, no, I need to talk to you privately. - Oh, Liam, he's good. In fact, I was just explaining to him how I had to fix things 14 years ago. I don't want to rehash all this now, our girl needs help. That's right. She needs help. Did I not tell you that it was not gonna work? So how did you fix this? Should I tell him? I had no choice, because she was pregnant, and Lucas' career was on the line. - You... you kill her? - Oh, grow up, would you? What are you? 11 going on 3? Dr. Kaplan performed a C-section ahead of schedule, that's all. The kid's alive. She's yours. - How old are you gonna be? - 14. Look, Jennifer wasn't feeling very well that day and your incredibly dear Harriet called me, so I helped. Shut up! Shut the hell up! I don't want to hear this right now! Alright? Just stop it! Is Lucas there? Yeah, can you ask him to come? Benny. Dr. Kaplan called it a... er... 'Placenta Abruptio'. It's a fascinating process. They actually separate the placenta from the uterus wall. Look, the important thing is that everybody, including drunken Jack, thought that it was the pregnancy that killed Jennifer. I mean, you've been in denial about this for how long? 14 years now? But... mmm... man that's good! It was a very clean cremation that you performed before that bitch, Patricia, started asking questions. What are you talking about? I didn't help you with any of what you did! That was you! I would have stopped it if I could have. I was just too... Oh, yes, yes, yes, you did. You might not have the guts to kill anybody but you knew nothing was going to get in the way of your career. Alright, alright, just send Sanders. You hurt that girl and I'll kill you. I will. Lucas, I don't think I've ever seen you kill so much as a fly. You need to understand something. I did it for you. I did it for the family. I took care of Kaplan, your mother... they were bad for this town. It's nothing personal. It's always, always business. - Sam! - You stay right there! I'm gonna take care of it. Sam! Sam! See which way she went? You watch that side. Jack! Jack! Daddy! Daddy! I told you she was trouble. Didn't I tell you she was trouble. Daddy, where are you? I can't believe Lucas. He should have known not to trust her. Can't worry about cops right now, gotta find that girl. Lucas, how many times I've given him opportunities. Do you know what he does every time? Screws it up. This is not good. She heard the whole conversation. You know? Is that her? Why don't you pick up the phone? Why can't I reach Jack. Why is there no service? Go dig a hole. Will you? After everything I've done for you and your family and you're with them? You are a sad man. Liam, get out of my way. - Please. - Liam, get out of my way. You killed my mother! Liam... Liam! Liam! Liam! Oh, Liam. Don't, please. Daddy? - I love you, Sam. - Daddy. I love you very much. I love you too. It's gonna be okay. - Where are you going? - It's gonna be okay. Please... - Where are you going? - I love you. - Sam! - Daddy. It's gonna be okay. - Daddy! - Sam, Sam, Sam, listen to me. He's not there. He's not there. Jack's not there. Jack's gone. Jack is dead. He died a long ago. He died a long ago. - Listen to me, he's been gone a long time. He's not here. - No, he's alive. He's alive. No, no, no, he died a long ago. - You did it. You killed your father. - Shut up! Just shut up! It was an accident. It was an accident, okay? Don't listen, don't pay attention to him. You can't even take care of your wife and child! I would never make my family something! Get out of my house! Enough is enough, get out! No, Daddy! Daddy? Listen to me Samantha. Samantha, you've been in a hospital a long time. I want to see if you could live on your own. Daddy? Daddy? You can, you can, you can. I promise you. It's gonna be okay. I will help you. I'm gonna help you. It's been over seven hours, and she hasn't uttered a word. We'll have to take her back to the hospital to continue her medication and treatments. Do you understand? Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
