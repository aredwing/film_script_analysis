The Fazar, Le Vaillant's written account of his experiences in the Holy Land, tells us he wandered the streets of conquered Jerusalem for days after that bloody battle, until he found the entrance of a cave that ran beneath the length of the holy city. Inside that cave, he began to record his epiphany, which became the basis for a new religious sect. An order that would combine the fundamental tenets of the three major religions of his day. His first converts were Christian knights who'd also become disenchanted by the bloodshed. The force of his convictions even won over a number of Muslims and Jews. Former enemies who now became willing converts to the new faith. Many years after completing the original Fazar, Le Vaillant had further revelations. He wrote these down, intending them to be added as the final chapter. Around this time he and his followers were being accused of heresy by the crusader authorities. On their way to Syria, he and a group of disciples were intercepted by some of the very same crusaders he had once commanded. During the battle that followed, Le Vaillant died a martyr's death. The final chapter he had written was lost. Do you have the alarm code? And no guards, right? You'll be like the fox in the henhouse. Heh, heh. Take as many eggs as you like. Yuri, it's Russian mob. No mistakes on this one. My friend, this is 1000 percent. By this time tomorrow, you'll be in New York making a deal. And I'll be in Tel Aviv waiting for my commission. Visual is all clear. - Come on. - Done. Way to go, Yuri. I'm in. Do you see the egg? It's beautiful. Yes! Yes! Yes! I'm going for it. - I got it. - Yuri's the man with the plan! - You're the man with the plan. - I told you... - Shit. - Rudy? Are you okay? - Was that a gunshot? - No, I farted. Yuri, guide me out of here. Oh, shit, Rudy. I'm sorry. Toilet! Hey, pal, this is a taxi zone. You wanna get towed away? Sorry. Watch it for me. - Hey. - Thanks. Right on. Perhaps you've seen enough stones and carvings. Come with me. I will show you a garment. A most controversial acquisition. This was unearthed beneath a false storage room, situated by Theodosius as a decoy against thieves. But often success as an archeologist depends on knowing where to dig. Well, I can dig her. Heh. Rudy! Would you take over? Can I have your? Okay, everybody, follow me. Dad, what's up? My main man! Why must you always attract attention? Come on, I love people, I love life... You love to embarrass me. I'm just having fun, Dad. - Anyway, you called. You want to talk? - Yes, but not here. Come on. Tell me, are you still involved with that same nonsense? Hey, I'm legit now. Straight. Import-export. And I'm kicking ass. Now, check this out. Here, take it. For you. Fancy watches, fast cars, easy money. What does it prove in the grand scheme of things, Rudy? - Yeah? - You have the egg? I've got it. Trust me, it's in pristine condition. - Ten o'clock. - Yeah, I'll be there. Later, tonight. Some business. - I hope for your sake it is legal. - A thousand percent. Come on. Damn plane tickets. They are here somewhere. - Where you going? On a dig? - No, an interview. Someone I've been trying to meet for a very long time. - Don't touch that! - Sorry. What is it? The lost chapter of the Fazar. Oh. The Fazar happens to be the holy scripture for an obscure Middle Eastern sect. And, yes, to answer your inevitable next question, it is quite valuable. But only to practicing members of the Order. What can I say, Dad? You have an exciting life. Rudy, we need to discuss some issues. Come by my apartment this evening. - Uh, I've got some business tonight. - Mm-hm. In fact, uh, it's time to go. All right. Can you at least call me? Of course. Absolutely. - Tonight. It has to be tonight. - You've got it, Dad. In your new dress As you spend your night Walkin' and boppin' Just to get it right Chugging your drink Till we break up out It's a mystery to me How you do that Be careful. Mr. Cafmeyer, this way, please. So let's see what Santa brought for me. Mm? This egg was designed by Peter Carl Faberg. A special gift to Czar Nicholas. Look at the inlay. Twenty-four-karat gold. What can I say? One of a kind. - That's why it's so expensive. - You cannot find this on the Net. Ha, ha. That's for sure. But stealing it from the Russian mafia, come on. Russian mafia? In fact, he's got some friends. Very nasty guys. If they found out about this, you'd end up with your balls stuffed and sewn inside your mouth. Whoa. So the deal about... No, no, no. Here's the deal. I'm giving you an easy out. I'll take this hot potato off your hands. - And I'll assume the risk. - Risk is my business. You're not listening, Rudy. Just a second, please. - Hello? - Rudy! Where are you? You promised to call me tonight! Uh, I'm in a business meeting. Really? Are you buying a disco? - Dad, please. - I can hear that music! Hey, where are you going? That is just what I'm trying to explain to you. Rudy, what is going on? Give it to him. Rudy. Hey, come here! Rudy? My egg. Move! Oh, shit. My eyes! Got a problem here? Hey, can I make a phone call over here? Not yet, Rudy. Heard you had a big night last night. How are you gonna pay for all that? Sell your Ferrari? Listen, I had a bad night, okay? Why do I have to look at your face in the morning? Huh? Is your father Oscar Cafmeyer? Yeah. Why? Yesterday, there was a manuscript in this case. Last night, security discovered it missing. So what? Your father was last to leave the building. This morning, nobody seems to know where he is. A case of like father, like son? - You're full of shit. - Rudy, relax. Why should he break the glass if he had a key? Nobody's making any accusations. We just wanna ask him some questions. You have any idea where he is? No. Rudy, I've been trying your mobile, but all I get is this recording. Oh, never mind. I will try again later. I'm staying at an old friend's home. Remember Walt Finley? He is teaching at Ben Gurion University. Now, this is his number: 972... - Hello? - Rudy? - Dad, how are you? - Thank God you're there. - Where are you? - Israel. - Israel? - Pay attention, I beg you. I was at the police station. You know what they're saying about you? Not now. I'm afraid I've gotten myself into some big trouble. - What do you mean? - What are you doing? Hang up! Dad! Who's that? Book me on the first flight to Israel. Tel Aviv. Right away! Take your glasses off, please. Visiting Israel on business or pleasure? Pleasure, always. Excuse me, uh, what's the delay? Our database shows that you've had several arrests for illegally transporting artifacts. Does it also show I was never convicted? Please open your carry-on. Any artifacts which you have not declared? Oh, the Mona Lisa. - Hmm. You like to joke. - They say laughter opens up the soul. Well, let it open the rest of your luggage too. - You're joking, right? - Ha-ha-ha. No. You know, this is bullshit. No, Mr. Cafmeyer. This is Israel. I apologize. Security is extra tight this month. Muslims are making their pilgrimage to Jerusalem for Ramadan. Passport, please. Rudy? Rudy Cafmeyer! - Who is this? - Walter Finley. Professor of archeology at Ben Gurion University. And what is your relationship to this man? Not that it's any of your business, I'm a friend of his father's. I've known him since he was in knickers, which would have put you in diapers. Now, are there any more insurmountable obstacles we have to overcome here, young lady? Thank you for your cooperation. Shalom. - Good to see you. - You too. - Where's my dad? - Look, let's get your bags into my car. - Watch where you go! - Up yours! Ozzie Cafmeyer is a cranky old fool. Calls me two days ago to pick him up at the airport. So I took him back to my house. We had dinner, talked... What was he doing here? I'm getting to that! What is this, the Spanish Inquisition? A few years ago, he found scrolls near the Syrian border. The lost final chapter of the Fazar written by Le Vaillant himself. Was he translating it? More than that. He was writing a history of the sect. An unauthorized history. He's been e-mailing me his chapters, having me lock them in a safe-deposit box here. - Why a safe-deposit box in Israel? - Because he trusted me. Here, here's the key. You ought to have it anyway. - Okay, where can I find these guys? - I'll show you. Their monastery is in east Jerusalem. The other side of the Mount of Olives. - We're wasting time. Let's go. - The present-day Order is just as reclusive as ever. Fanatically adverse to publicity. No contact to the outside world. You'd do better trying to get an audience with the pope. Those are the guys that came by the house and picked up your dad! Hey! Hey, you! - Jump in. I'll drive. - You don't know the way. - You'll navigate, okay? - Be careful. This is a classic car. Professor, buckle up. - Aah! - It's them! Get down! My car! Shit. Sorry about the car. - There they are. - Let's just nail these sons of bitches. You okay? - I'm fine. - Good. Where's my father, you son of a bitch? I'm gonna kill you! You okay? Finley, look out! Rudy... - Stay right there! Don't move! - He needs a doctor. Help me! - Hey, it's not me! - Up. - Get up. - It's not me! And so you are telling us these men kidnapped your father. They took him somewhere. No one's heard from him. Mr. Cafmeyer, I can smell bullshit a mile away. You're only five feet from me. I believe you're using the alleged disappearance as a cover to smuggle artifacts out of Israel. Alleged? My father was here. Now he's missing. This has nothing to do with why you are in police custody. You were found next to the corpse of a prominent professor. Let me guess. You're accusing me of killing him? Until we have more facts, all options are open. I'm placing you under house arrest. You'll be taken to a hotel until we complete our investigation into the professor's death. You know why you're smelling bullshit? Because you're up to your nose in it. I'll be next door if you need anything. - What about a taxi? - Within reason. - What about my father? - We're looking into it. Good night. - Good night, officer. - Lieutenant Barr. Dalia Barr. - How are you? - Okay. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Yuri. - Rudy! Rudy, let me explain what happened in Odessa. Explain what? You left me hanging like a piece of laundry. But there was this cop... Admit it! You little slimeball. Or you'll never see your money. - What money? - I sold the egg. Remember our deal? Ten percent. That's 50 G's for you, my friend. Lucky for you, this place makes me generous. Thank you, Rudy. Thank you. Rudy, do you have the cash with you? It's under my mattress. Of course I have it. But I'm leaving tonight. Tonight? Uh... Can we meet first? Come to my office in Tel Aviv. I have a beautiful new penthouse suite in the diamond district. You'll be my special guest. We'd like to use the phone. Rudy? Uh... Yuri, I have a much better idea. Yuri. Yuri. Is that you, Rudy? You slimeball. You almost got me killed! Hey, Rudy, it wasn't my fault! - You owe me. - Owe you? - You owe me. - What do you mean? - You owe me, I said! - Anything, Rudy. Anything. Just tell me what I can do to help, my friend. I need this map translated. Can you do it? - Sure. - Sure? - Sure. - Sure. I'm positive! I'm a pro, my friend! - And this print. - Done. For you, anything. Understand something. I know where you sleep... It wasn't my fault! There were cops... Cops. Let's split up. I'll call you. Go. Go. Shalom. Look, there he is. Stop! Hey, you! Stop! Cafmeyer! Hey, you! Stop! Get away! Move! Hey, hey! Stop! No. Hey, you! Stop! Stop! Stop! Come on! Come on! Don't move! Freeze! Huh? Excuse me. Cuff them. You know how much trouble I'm in because of you? Do you know? Let's have a coffee and talk about it. You have proved to me that my original hunch was correct. You cannot be trusted. I came here to look for my father. I did what I had to do because nobody gives a shit! We spoke to Immigration. They have no record of him entering the country. That's impossible. What's really going on? Were you perhaps planning to smuggle out a little something, hm? Hey, those are mine! What's going on? Yes, we checked you out of the hotel. Change at the airport. You're going home. - You cannot do that. - I can, and will. Can you take him to the airport without him escaping? Yes, sir. - What about Finley's murder? - You're no longer a suspect. I'm still the only witness! We have your testimony, thank you. Enjoy your flight, Mr. Cafmeyer. You're not helping me! You're helping yourself! You're full of shit! - Move it! - What's going on?! What did you find? Today, as every year at this time, we come to this special place to commemorate the departure of the knights of Christendom from these shores. Brother Cyrus will now lead us in a passage from the Fazar. Thank you, first disciple. As was prophesied in the Book of Tribulations, we await the return of the Army of God, who shall rise like a tide against the sea of those who do not believe. Cyrus, by what authority do you quote from that disreputable source? As second disciple, you should know better! I beg your forgiveness. It was an unpardonable error. Le Vaillant himself once followed a false path toward God. We must choose our words carefully. Wars have started for less. I will ask for forgiveness at evening vespers. Your flight doesn't leave for a few hours. You hungry? Someone here actually cares about me? We may be overly cautious with security and our artifacts, but we're not barbarians, Mr. Cafmeyer. It'd be a shame if you left without sampling some fresh hummus. You like? - I'd like it more without this. - Sorry. Look, I came here to find my father. He told me he was in trouble. He's the type of guy who never lies. It sounds like you really care about him. The two of you must be very close. He taught me everything about paintings, antiques, you name it. You certainly applied that knowledge. Let's say I did. I never meant to hurt him. - That's bothering you now? - Yes, because now he's missing. And I'm just starting to realize what I missed. Why am I telling you all this? You're tired. You're jet-lagged. You'll feel a lot better once you're back on a plane. No, I'll feel better when I find him. This attack was a brutal and senseless act perpetrated on a man who devoted his life to God and to peace. His brothers and sisters mourn his passing and pray that those responsible find repentance. Who died? Pierre Gaudet, the leader of some religious sect. - You mean the Order? - Mm-hm. Come on, this way. Come on. Please keep on moving. - Hello. - Get the prisoner off the plane. - I want him brought back here. - Why? We've been informed he's leaving with an artifact. - Customs checked him. I saw... - Just do it, lieutenant! - What's going on? - You're staying in Israel. What? They said you're trying to smuggle an artifact. Do you believe that? Something is not kosher here. I'm not trying to be funny, okay? When I signal, run to the back stairs. If you make it to the service road, I'll be waiting. - If I make it? - Now push me. Just push me. Over here! He's escaping! Quick! - Unh! - Quick! I need assistance up here! What? What are you doing? Hey! Hey! The stairs are slowing him down! We can catch him! Rudy! Get in the back. Hurry. Get down. Get down! You all right? You missed him. He went over the fence. - You're safe now. - Safe from what? I've got some questions for you, okay? - I used to belong to the Order. - What? - You should've told me this before. - I couldn't. - Of course not. You're part of it. - No, I didn't know this was related. - Oh, sure. You knew about my father. - Where are you going? Hey! Hey! I just risked my ass for you! Why? So you can hand me over to the Order? I left the Order when I was 18. - Oh, you left the Order? - I wanted to create my own life. So meeting you at the airport was no accident. Look, Rudy, let me explain a few things to you, okay? Most of the followers are peaceful and life-affirming. There is a small group of fanatics who believe in a darker path. They call themselves the Army of God. They've been on standby for years. And you think they took my father? I don't know. They might also be the ones who killed Gaudet. Hey, Rudy, my friend! - Who's the cop? - Everything's fine. She's with us. Uh-huh. My friend, look what I printed out for you from the disc. - It's not translated yet, but... Uh-huh. - It looks like a map of Jerusalem. Middle Ages, European design. What's the language? Aramaic. The language of Palestinian Christians at the time the Crusades. See these lines? Here and here? They are caves and tunnels beneath the old city. They've remained hidden since the holy wars. Professor Finley told me about those. What he didn't tell you is what they lead to. Why would an archeology professor bring the scrolls to New York but leave the map in Israel hidden inside a safe-deposit box? Because the map leads to something even more valuable. - The people who left forgot something. - Let's hide this. Hands in the air! Get them up! Move! Where is it? Where is it? Freeze! Oh! Oh. Give me that. Come on. Hold on. Rudy. Thank you, Avram. After all this time, you come back to me like this. Avram, you know I've had to make some difficult choices. You chose to leave. Please, can we talk about this later? I really need some water and clean rags right now. - Here's some water. - Thank you, Avram. - Where am I? - A friend's. How long have I been here? Two days now. Hey. Shh. You really should rest. - I'm okay. - Well enough to leave? - Israeli hospitality kills me. - No, it just saved your life. - Here. Your father's book. - Yeah. I've been going through this. You really should too. The lost chapter predicts a revolution, one that is peaceful and spiritual in nature. This will not be good news to the radical Army of God who contend that Le Vaillant prophesied a catastrophic holy war. I suspect this militant faction will stop at nothing to suppress the true contents of this final chapter. Though my safety may be an issue, I have requested an interview with the first disciple to make these matters known. Your scholar seems to be on the verge of enlightenment. It wouldn't hurt you to sample some of it yourself. Dalia, the world is as filled with temptations as it is with false prophets. Onions. I need onions. - Is everything okay? - We were just... We were discussing the manuscript. It's a fraud. A fraud? The scrolls, they were tested. - By whom? Secular scientists? - If you would open your mind... - To what? - To this, Avram. What is this? What is this? It's mentioned in the Fazar. Solomon's gold. A treasure the ancient Hebrews hid under the city. Which might explain why people with guns have been chasing us. It explains nothing but your ignorance. The treasure is a metaphor for the wisdom of the ancient sages. Avram, I need to get to the monastery. I think they're holding my father. Impossible. No outsider is permitted. What about an insider? A member from overseas that is here on pilgrimage? That's Cyrus. The new first disciple. Children of God, I stand here before you today in great sorrow. For what should be a celebration of hope and joy, must instead be looked upon as a call to action. God's vengeance for this murderous deed will be swift and without mercy! May the eternal spirit of Pierre Gaudet guide us on this path of deliverance. - Time to see if my father's alive. - Try the catacombs first. That door leads to a small stairway. Follow it all the way down. Rudy. Be careful. Rudy. - Dad! Are you all right? - Rudy. Yes. Let me get you out of here. Unh! No, no, I already tried. No, forget about me. You have to stop them. Pull off that tarp. You will see what this is all about. Rudy, go. Go! - This looks like a... - A bomb? Sorry we're late, but I could give a shit about this coronation. Tonight, we will all witness a miracle. As God's fury cleanses the souls of those against us, let the new age begin! - Where are you going? - To find Rudy. Avram, we have to put a stop to this. All right, I'm coming with you. This way. Rudy! Dalia, stop! It's a trap. Now be a good girl, Dalia, and come down here. Since when did you take your vows with the Order, major? The day Cyrus vowed there was treasure under the Temple Mount. That's the day I found religion. Ha, ha. Hello, professor. Dad, meet Dalia. She's a good cop. Now let's ask the major what the big bomb is for. Huh? It's Ramadan. Islamic leaders from around the world will be on the Temple Mount at noon. What are you saying? This nut case is gonna blow it up? That will start World War III. Especially when they find the bodies of an Israeli and an American. No, no, you're crazy! This is impossible. You've completely misinterpreted the words of the first disciple. And you are a naive moron. You have truly lost the way, Cyrus. On the contrary, I've found it. I want to thank you, young Cafmeyer, for unwittingly providing the final piece of the puzzle. And thank you, Avram, for your loyalty and devotion. But, first disciple, what they're saying here... Avram, If you've read the Book of Tribulations carefully, you are aware that the holy war is triggered by a singular event. Behold the event. And as my unwavering one, I shall grant you the privilege of assisting us. Bind him, and her too. Now, where's my guide? - Unh! Dad! - No! Stop! - There is no need for that! - Then you will be assisting us too? - What's he talking about? - With the map, your father can guide us under the Temple Mount. Cyrus, please. Millions will die. It is written! I will raise Mount Moriah and build a new temple. That prophecy you are quoting is a fabrication! - Unh! - Dad! Unh! Don't do shit for him. Apparently, stubbornness is an ingrained family trait. Beats a messiah complex any day. - Aah! Unh. - Stop! I will do it. I will guide you. God help us all. He helps those who help themselves, professor. We are near the Temple Mount. That is where the traps begin. Perhaps we should use someone expendable to lead the way. Young Mr. Cafmeyer, we have a job for you. Rudy! - Rudy, be careful. - Okay. Go. Avram. Avram! Somebody help him! No! Let me go, damn it! Careful, Rudy. Come on, Avram. - You deceived me. - This is the way according to the map. - How do we proceed? - What's the matter with you guys? See these beams? We take them down and we build a bridge. Oh, my God. - This is not the Well of Souls. - Unh! In the next chamber, I swear. Show me. Directly above us, the Dome of the Rock, Islam's third holiest shrine. And henceforth from this day forward, the holiest shrine of the Order. Cyrus, I beg you to reconsider. Bring the bomb. Hey, hey. Hold on, hold on. We'll get to that. First, we fill these bags. There's no time. Would you take a look around you, Cyrus? There's a king's treasure here. Enough to finance 10 of your holy wars. We set the bomb now. We can do this the easy way, or the very easy way. I have a prophecy to fulfill. And I have a Swiss bank account to fill. That's the only reason I joined your crazy scheme in the first place. - Idiots! - Professor, here. Stop them! Don't let them get away! - Unh! - Aah! No! Avram, no! - Rudy, your dad! - Dad, you're hit. - Unh! Unh. - Dalia, come on. Let's go. Over here. Dad, you stay here. We'll be back. I'll be fine. Let's go. Come on. They couldn't have come this far. We must've passed them. Come on, let's double back. Let's split. Go! Get after him! I'll take care of that bitch! - Ah. Help me with these. - Assist him. Shit! Hey, Dad, meet Dalia. She's the dead cop! Wrong, major. - Professor, are you okay? - I'm fine. - Take my father out of here. - What about you? - I've got to stop the bomb. - Rudy, please be careful. Come on, professor. Let's go. - Are you ready for this? - Thank you. Psst. The bomb is set. It's irreversible. The prophecy will be fulfilled, and I will vanquish my enemy. You can't stop the prophecy. You read the wrong book, pal. Now it's time to say bon voyage. Shalom! Please, stay calm. - Hey, Dad. - Rudy! My main man! Hey, this is great. A few more to sign, then we can go to lunch. Take your time. - Don't touch that! - Oh! I'm sorry. What is this? It is a map which purports to show the location of the fabled seven cities of Cibola near Cancn on the Yucatn peninsula. - Oh. - These, ostensibly, hm, are the legendary cities of gold containing the Mayan treasure, which the Spanish conquistadors so desperately had sought. And to answer your inevitable next question: Yes, it is quite valuable. Ha, ha. Rudy? Rudy? Rudy! So where to, young Cafmeyer? - Cancn, Mexico. - Mm-hm. - Will that be business or pleasure? - Pleasure, always. - Rudy! - Oh. Cut?
