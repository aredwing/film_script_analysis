But with street dance, l could step out in front of any crowd, into any street dance battle, and for one moment, be the hero. And then, being alone didn't matter any more. l was able to show off my moves, taking on the local legends in street dance battles. And legends, they don't come any bigger than this crew. Two-times Final Clash Champions and on their way to Paris to make it three. lnvincible. Named after the biggest ego in street dance. -Vince. -(CROWD CHEERlNG) (CROWD CHANTlNG) Vince! Vince! Vince! Vince! ASH: This was the moment, right here in London. The moment to take on the legend. This was the moment to be the best. (CROWD CHEERlNG) This was my moment. (LAUGHlNG) -Or not. -(LAUGHS) Yeah, yeah. ls that all you got? Some nerdy little popcorn boy who can't even stay on his feet? You got two months, Europe, till the Final Clash. (CROWD BOOlNG) Y'all better rustle up some new ideas. Or we will kick ass. -(BOOlNG) -You got that, Popcorn? (SHOUTlNG AND JEERlNG) l was just trying to see the show. Easy, easy, easy. Easy! (GRUNTS) (GROANlNG) (DlSTANT RAP SONG PLAYlNG) -What? You come to have a laugh too? -No. l wanna be your manager. l'm gonna help you put a crew together for the Final Clash. Right now is not a good time. You know, you jumping in there and falling on your arse was really, really... l know. Really stupid. No, inspiring. You showed a lot of courage. -Thanks. -Look, someone needs to stand up to Vince. And that's why l think l'd be a top manager. l can get you all the top dancers you need to beat lnvincible. -Who are you? -Hi. l'm Eddie. Look, Eddie, thanks for your offer, but lnvincible are just that, invincible. -Look, you're impulsive. -l'm impulsive? Yes, and you need to learn a bit of patience. -Taxi. -A bit of discipline. -l could be your Yoda. -Yoda? Secondly, you're American and l'm European. So you could use someone local. Someone who understands the culture. Like a tour guide. Et trois, the Final Clash is in Paris. And l speak fluent European. Ooh-la-la, garcon, baguette, fromage, croissant. # Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? # Ce soir? # Okay, Yoda, what's the great plan? We've got eight weeks before the Final Clash. lf we've got any chance of beating them in Paris, we need to get the top dancers in Europe. -The mavericks, people like us, loners. -Genuine freestylers. People with their own moves and their own styles. We have to track them down and convince them to join us. lnvincible think they've seen everything. But what we've gotta do... -We gotta show them that they haven't. -Exactly. lf we wanna pull this off, we need the best of the best. La creme de la creme. Do you have anyone in mind? (APACHE PLAYlNG) Eddie! (LAUGHlNG) Next. (CROWD CHEERlNG) ASH: How about it? You wanna take down lnvincible? -(LAUGHS) -Told you. On my time? With my crew? -So l guess that's a no? -Damn right it is. Seriously? You need to get yourself a real manager. Breakin' Point. Still hurts, doesn't it? (FARTlNG) (BLEATlNG) (APACHE CONTlNUES PLAYlNG) Police! (WOMAN SHOUTlNG lN lTALlAN) (LAUGHlNG) Bye-bye. -Thank you. -(SQUEALlNG) Sorry. (HORNS BLARlNG) -Oh! -Ciao. Whoa! You, my friend, are wasting your talents. ASH: We'd done it. The perfect crew in the City of Love. One big happy family. -Ash, the food is disgusting. -Yes, and nothing is halal. The room sucks, the food sucks, and we can't get sleep because of Tino snoring. -Oi! l don't snore. -ALL: Yes, you do. Come on, Ash. You're our mighty leader, right? -Do something. -Guys, guys, leave Ash alone. -You want food? -Yes. Fill your boots. lf there's a problem, l'm the manager, come see me. Problem 1 01 . -Toilet's blocked. -Yeah, he's right. -Toilet's blocked. -Disgusting. -Okay, Okay. Guys, quiet. -...is dirty. Look, l understand conditions are really rough. But we've got a place to stay, we've got food. -Yes, but... -l'm working on the halal. But we've only got six weeks before the Final Clash. So we've got to pull together as a crew so we can win this. -You still wanna win this, right? -Yes! -Yes, we wanna win. -Let's eat. l can't even believe that we got every single person that we wanted. -We are so on the money. -Exactly, so on the money. Now we got all the right ingredients to take down lnvincible, l'll tell you that. All except one. (LATlN DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) -Really funny. -We've gotta think outside the box. ASH: Well, there's outside the box and then there's a whole other planet. EDDlE: You'll see. Please get us a drink. Excusez. Can l have une biere et une Manu special, s'il vous plait? Deux, trois, cinq. . . Seize. Seize! ASH: While Eddie struggled with his terrible French, l struggled with how on earth Latin was going to help us beat lnvincible -in a street dance battle. -(BELL DlNGS) (CHEERlNG) (RHYTHMlC BEAT PLAYlNG) And then l saw. Hey! Oh, come on, help us out. We're only a few Euros short. Tell you what, if you can stay in the ring for one dance with her, l give you the drink. -You speak English. -Better than you, my friend. -Wait, what do you mean, "stay in the ring"? -lf you can keep up with her for one dance. -Like a battle? -lf you like. -(CHUCKLlNG) -Don't spill my drink. (BELL DlNGS) (ALL CHEERlNG) Oi! -(ALL BOOlNG) -l'm sorry. (LATlN DANCE MUSlC STARTlNG) Best of luck. Okay. l'm sorry, l didn't catch your name. Eva. (QUlMBARA REMlX PLAYING) (ALL BOOlNG) -You're absolutely amazing. -l'm kind of busy. (CHEERlNG) That's what l call a battle. (BlRD CHlRPlNG) Lucien, bye. -l'll see you tomorrow. Bye! -Okay. Wish me luck! Hi, again. Hi. l wanted to ask you something. No, thank you. You don't even know what it is yet. Yeah, but l don't drink and l'm not hungry, so good night. Why do you dance? l mean, l dance to have a good time, have a laugh, show off. But l made a real fool of myself recently in front of a lot of people and... -Should l start playing the violin? -(LAUGHS) No. 'Cause my story has a happy ending. l met you. You know, l've heard some cheesy pick-up lines in my time, but this one beats them all. Join my crew. -Quoi? -My street dance crew. We're going to the Final Clash. lt's the biggest battle in Europe. l'm happy doing my own thing. We could come up with a whole new style, like a fusion of Latin and street, something that nobody has ever seen before. So you want me to join a street dance crew, dancing a style that hasn't been invented yet? -Pretty much, yeah. -You're an escaped crazy guy, right? l prefer dreamer, but sure. l tell you what, you bring me this great crew and l'll think about it. -ls that a promise? -No, that's a "think about it". That's good enough for me. You were right, she is absolutely perfect. With her and those moves, lnvincible won't even stand a chance! Let me just get this clear. This is a Latin-street-dance fusion we're talking about here, not an Ash-Eva fusion. -Eva. That sounds really beautiful. -Focus, Ash. -We've still got to convince the crew. -But they'll love the tango! -Salsa! -Salsa, tango, whatever. Look, we'll show her the crew, she'll love 'em, bam, we're unbeatable. Bonjour. lt's that crazy guy again. And my crew. (UNORTHODOX PLAYlNG) Oh, mon Dieu. This is not a refugee camp. -Uncle, it's okay. -MANU: We're closed. lt's okay. You said you'd think about it. Well, let's see what they can do. # And now l feel like l'm the reason l should last # l move like my ish don't stink # But l'm all in a trance, no hit, no assist # This is all from the heart, intro, no script # l'm just about writing it down # So now l don't sleep, man l miss those nights # l take planes like trains l don't miss no flights # l'm the type of guy that will have no life # Just so l can shine like this gold life # And that sounds sad but l'm happy # And the only plans to stay scatty # Yeah, unorthodox, l made the bar so l call the shots # We don't follow no crowd, they follow us # Don't follow no sound, it follows us # Go sit in hell, look down that wishing well # Unorthodox, we call our own shots # Yeah, l got a good vibe # l ain't trying to be bait with my hook lines # l had a feeling l could fly # Before l hopped on a plane or a new sky # Yeah, l'm a good guy # And if you heard otherwise, it's a true lie # l'm hype, l don't do shy # l bark up every tree and l do bite # Psych, l'm only playing # You all got freedom of speech, l'm only saying # l ain't got time for beef, l'm on the way in # So the eighth day of the week's my only lay in # That sounds sad but l'm happy # And the only plan's to stay scatty # Yeah, unorthodox, l made the bar so l call the shots # We don't follow no crowd, they follow us # Don't follow no sound, it follows us # Go sit in hell, look down that wishing well # Unorthodox, we call our own shots # No one can hold us down again l need an answer. This is something we could be a part of. "We"? Me and my dance partner. Lucien. # We don't follow no crowd, they follow us # Don't follow no sound... # -All right, playtime is over, thank you. -(ALL PROTESTlNG) -Ciao. -ASH: Listen up. We've only got six weeks to get ready for the Final Clash. And if we want to win this, we gotta come up with something that is so different that lnvincible won't have an answer. Eva, Lucy... Lucien. Right. Lucien. Take the floor. (CREW LAUGHlNG) (MURMURlNG) (ALL LAUGHlNG) (MOCKlNG CHATTER) LUClEN: Stop. That's it. l don't want to dance for these idiots. -Ooh! -Ciao. That's granny style. -(SPEAKS lTALlAN) -This is ridiculous, Ash. l'm a B-boy. Don't try and make us look stupid. That went very well. Eva, please. Give us a chance. Your friends have no manners. l know, l know. But they're good guys. lt's just... Street dance is all about front and reputation. They just don't want to lose face. But they don't... They don't know what you do yet. Well, go figure it out. (SlGHlNG) ASH: You see, a good idea is just an idea... Until you make it work. TlNO: We're here to battle. ASH: The crew couldn't understand why l wanted the best street dancers in Europe to do Latin. But l wasn't giving up without a fight. You guys are so stuck on what you know. l had to persuade the crew to come back to the club with me one more time. (LES TRES GORDOS REMlX PLAYING) All right? (EXCLAlMS) Latin dance is vicious. We hear you, man. Thank you. Well done. -l think we're definitely on again. -(CHUCKLlNG) What makes you think l want any more to do with you? Well, you liked what you saw earlier and you can see how this might work. (SCOFFS) Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? l gotta be. l'm the leader of this thing. Teach us some of it. Then l want you in bed. Your first lesson starts at 9:00. ln the morning. ASH: lf we were going to beat lnvincible at the Final Clash, Eddie's Latin idea had to work. For the first time in my life, l was going to have to learn how to dance with someone. One, two, three and step. Fingertips. -One, two, three... -Stop jiggling your shoulders. Turn me a little bit slower. No, okay, stop. You're showing off. l'm just dancing. No. You want to look good. Get applause from the crowd. But listen. You're not dancing with them, you're dancing with me. Again. No. Reach out your hand. Good. This is a tough crowd. Listen, salsa is not about the choreography or the steps. lt's about the passion. You have to feel it, mean it. Yeah? -Feel it? -Yes. Okay. And one, two, three. Good. Now cross-body lead. What are you doing? We don't have that much time. l'm just... Just teach me one of those tricks that l can use against lnvincible. The basics first. You've got a battle to prepare for. lf l can't trust you with the simple stuff, how am l gonna trust you with the tricks? l'm sorry. Relax. So l guess dinner is out of the question? EVA: Good... Good. Now cross-body lead. Good. Better. Two times. And... Yeah. Okay, good. Let's leave it there. Um, Uncle, remember Ash? Hard to forget. Ash, Manu. -Hello. -Hi. l'm going to be working with him. lt's okay to practise here, right? Yeah, of course. And his friends too? They're practising in their hostel. Sure. Why not? (BOTH CHUCKLE) -ASH: Thank you. l really appreciate that. -My pleasure. Well, l should probably head back -and tell them the good news. -Mmm. -l'll see you out. -Thank you. -Eva's really incredible. -Mmm. You're gonna have to come down -and see her in the battle. -Mmm-hmm. lf you hurt her, l will break your legs. ASH: Five, six, seven, let's go. (BASS DOWN LOW PLAYlNG) (ASH CONTlNUES COUNTlNG THE STEPS) # lf you wanna get with me There's some things you gotta know # l like my beats fast, and my bass down low # Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low # Bass, bass, bass down low # l, l, l like my beats fast And my bass down low # Bass, bass down low # Bass, bass, bass down low # Bass, bass, bass down low, low, low, low, low, low # ASH: All right, everybody, take a break. Take a break. Get some water. -Can you please show me that step? -Sure. One, two, three and four. -One, two, three and four. -Yep, that's good. Yo, Ash has been giving you extra lessons, huh? (ALL LAUGHlNG) EVA: Well, l've been giving him extra lessons. YOYO: Oh. BAM-BAM: So you like him? As much as any of you. -Oh. -Yeah, right. Let us know when you gonna find his tattoo. (BOTH LAUGHlNG) Okay. Well, can you show me that step again? -Okay. -BOTH: One, two, three and four. Thanks, Steph. Take five. Take a break. Come on. You look great out there.

Well, listen, you be careful of him. l know guys like that. l was guys like that. Ooh! ASH: Three weeks to the Final Clash, and things were finally coming together. Just one problem. (LOUD SNORlNG) -(THUDDlNG) -Shh!

(ASH PANTlNG) Sorry. Let's just try it again. Dance with your heart, not with your head. You're still thinking like a soloist. l want to try something. lt's an exercise in trust. Do l get a last request? (SLOW TANGO MUSlC PLAYlNG) People think tango is only about sex. But it's about so much more. lt's about channelling your passion. lt's about precision, control, discipline. Follow my movements until you begin to sense them. Tango is a shared language. There are no secrets... -Careful of the tree! Stop! -(GRUNTS) (LAUGHlNG) No lies... Just the dance. (BOTH BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) Good. Remember how that felt next time we dance. l'll never forget. l'm sorry if l've been a bit... Unfriendly? Over-professional. Maybe we could have dinner. lt wouldn't hurt our dancing to get to know each other a little better. Smells great. He is a one. (LAUGHlNG) No, Uncle, he is a two. Definitely a one. Would somebody mind explaining to me what's going on? Uncle has a way ofjudging men. lt never fails. He can tell what sort of man you are by how many chillies you eat. You are a one. -So how many chillies do you usually have? -Four... -Serve it up. -Ash? Seriously. -MANU: Bon. -He'll take two. -Four. -EVA: He'll take two. -MANU: Ah! -Ash, you don't have to prove anything. No, no, no. No. l like hot food. -l actually love hot food. lt's great, yeah. Bon. -Bon. Merci. Bon appetit. (BREATHlNG HARD) (VOlCE QUAVERlNG) lt's really nice. Oh, mon Dieu. Are you okay? Excuse me for a second. (LAUGHlNG) (GARGLES) Oh... l like this man. Oh. Oh, l like.

Ah! l dare you to get naked. l'm not getting naked with you. MANU: (CHUCKLlNG) Not your body, but... Maybe a little piece of your soul, hmm? (SlGHlNG) When l offer you this, l don't just invite you to dance. l ask you to trust me. -(ALL ENCOURAGlNG) -lt's all right. Come.

You mean a strictly professional date, under the strictly professional moonlight in the most romantic city on Earth. We'll just have dinner and we're gonna talk about the routine. Talk about the routine. You know, just imagine Vince's face when you and Eva drop that Latin fusion. ASH: Trouble was, l could imagine Vince's face, all too clearly. l knew he'd be in Paris by now, preparing for the Final, and l couldn't shake the memory of my popcorn humiliation. (JAUNTY WALTZ PLAYlNG) You're quiet tonight. l'm just thinking. What if people don't get it? l mean, our street Latin fusion. Dancing when it's just us is one thing but... ln a street dance battle, l just don't... Do you really wanna do this? Yes. Then you shouldn't back away. l'm here because l believe in it... And you.
