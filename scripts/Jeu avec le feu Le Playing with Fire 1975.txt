She's a pedigree, but not very well trained yet. If you don't stop, you'll get a good beating. Not that please! You see, already beginning to understand. Message for Giorgio Baldassarre De Saxe. Banker. Age 47. Widow with an only daughter. Carolina. Carolina. Carolina. Carolina is in the park, reading a book. Innocent and peaceful. Right now she's in great danger. - Who are you? Hello! - I repeat... Carolina is in the park, reading a book. - What do you want? - Innocent and peaceful. Right now she's in great danger. Message for Giorgio... Ah Maria... go immediately... Tell Matteo to join me at the bottom of the garden. As soon as possible. My respects Sir. Your daughter, Sir, and has just been kidnapped. Alas kidnapped. Your daughter Carolina. She is now in a safe place. In the hands of an organization both powerful and cruel. The ransom was fixed at one million dollars. In convertible currency, or petrodollars. The method of payment will be communicated by return post. The price is fixed, and no haggling. Promptness of payment is an essential condition. Otherwise interest will be applied on a daily basis. And also... The organization reserves the right to utilize the economic potential of the girl giving her to clients of a special house for perverts, in which Carolina will satisfy their sexual fantasies. An exhausting work which could tire her, of course, bit by bit. If the police are notified... Your daughter will be burned alive. We can guarantee a complete result, total and definitive. Allow me Sir to show you our references on the seriousness of our business. Ah, it's you Matteo. - Sir is unwell? - It will pass. They squirted... a kind of drug, right in my eyes Oh. Unhappy clients who were protesting about the interest rate? No, you fool! They were... I don't know who they were. Sir doesn't consider that they were businessmen? Maybe they wanted a loan. No... they didn't ask for anything. Ah. Well, in that case they could be thieves. I'll check that everything is in order. Quick! Quick! For love of me I can't say more Your little Carolina Lost Excuse me Sir, I saw nothing at all suspicious. Tell me Matteo, what time did my daughter leave this morning? Does anyone in the house know where she went? As far as I know the young lady left around nine. As for knowing where she went the easiest thing is for Sir to ask her. She's just now returned. I met her as I was leaving the house whilst she was going up to her room. With your permission, I'll go into town. Good, you're here. I'm here. What's wrong with that? Has nothing odd happened to you today? Odd in what sense? Was it you wrote this postcard? No, why? And yet it's your writing. Yes... Oh, silly me! With the idea of arriving early a stupid taxi driver took me on an incredible tour. And as always happens, we got completely stuck. Excuse me, could I have an autograph? You needn't add anything in memory... of this meeting... only too brief? Yes, but we must hurry. It's a bit dry. You couldn't... put for example... 'your Carolina'? Why should I do that? Let's say... for my love. Hop, hop, hop. The game went marvelously. The arc remains and the triumph won't give us any more trouble. All done. Carolina De Saxe is already in our hands. Details. Abducted without incident, with extreme discretion, and transported in the safest of hiding places. - Further details. - The request is turned down. All are equal before the law. Even the head. Everyone observes the autonomous responsibility of their own sector. Watertight compartments, efficiency. No risk of blabbering and limited damage in case of accident. And that's what I say. Special instructions? No, I want daily reports. - This is your right. - Goodbye. Call Pierre Garen. Follow Franz. Okay. Why? No questions. Report twice a day. On Franz? 'Kay... - Carry it out. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Excuse me Sir. But here's a message which arrived earlier, while Sir was in the gardens. and that I forgot because of the commotion. I should point out that it was the cause of my delay in rejoining Sir. The instructions for freeing the prisoner will be given at the point marked with a cross on the photograph. I apologize to the gentleman. But it seems to me that the thing becomes jolly exciting! It could be something serious. Perhaps there was only a mistake in the layout of the script. And tonight... or tomorrow... So you think I'm going to be kidnapped. And what will they do with me in their lair? - Good morning. - Yes? You have technical and moral prejudices against sadism? No. Just don't overdo it. What do you like? Spanking? Rather the whip. Cigarettes, trestle and nettles, swabs soaked in alcohol, and so on. It's a demanding genre. And these things are expensive. Sure. We'll fix the price and pocket the money. And no one will ask your opinion. Contact Julien Jacques, your pimp. Don't make such a fuss. Write him a nice little note. He'll have to turn quite a few tricks if he wants to regain his capital. Rectifying the error in pagination, the kidnap could take place equally... Tomorrow, today perhaps. With a slight delay. A standstill. A pause, from which we should profit, to put ourselves under the protection of the police. So far, it's an empty threat, which I've carefully hidden. But to what end? Ah Carol... Caroline... Carolina... Given that it seems to be an empty threat, we use the breathing space, to alert the police. Without wasting a moment. Four, three, two, one... zero! What happened? I wanted to burn some papers and there was an explosion! But why? What papers? Nothing but old stuff! And this? What is it? An old doll, they've kept. A doll made of celluloid in the fire? Don't you know it's dangerous? Many children have been burned alive! But I didn't throw it on purpose, I don't know who put it in the basket, with all the papers to burn. I did it without looking. - You're not hurt? - No. Sure? Just a bit. A little burn. It looks like the paw of a cat. And if it was an attack? Inflammable stuff put there on purpose. Calm down. Don't invent unnecessary concerns. I wanted to call the police. But it is better not to for the moment. After all, you've not been kidnapped. And all that's happened, seems... a game. Miss! You'll be safe here. Go! Go!... Down! Go! Now, theyve gone. You can get out. It seems they just wanted to play. You think so? Yes. but... You've been bitten? Oh no, no, only scratches made from the bushes. Oh, but I wouldn't be so sure. No, no. Those scratches have been made by teeth. They're nothing, anyway. Yes. A dog that tries to bite must be mad. It's essential you get an injection straight away. - But how? - Luckily there's a doctor. Don't be surprised... It's a new social service. - There won't be a scar? - Absolutely not. It's the kind of merchandise that customers want intact. I must have lost my purse when I ran just now. Don't worry. You won't need it now. Clear off! This isn't for you. One: You have been weighed in the balance, and found wanting. Two: you have lost the opportunity to save your happiness and your power. Three: your empire, and the flesh of your flesh will perish in flames. Are you working on the house? No, I don't know what's happening. Carolina, could you ring please? - The lady rang? - Yes, Matteo. What's that racket? A thousand apologies. But it was only a minor incident from ancillary life. I allowed myself to take steps to violate Maria, but the cat interfered inappropriately. Again! If Sir will permit, I'll go and take action. I'm sorry to have been so... clumsy. I had to slander that innocent feline. - Got it? - I'll be more careful. Now there's a guy there. Behave yourself properly. At least with him. I'll do my best. And do it well if you don't want trouble. Here's all that we know. A non-existent kidnapping, a huge ransom to be paid, a secret appointment at the most visible place in Paris. And no specific threat? No. Then it's all a joke, without a doubt. But it's best to be careful, however. You should place Miss Carolina in a safe location. No, I'd rather stay at home! And safe here. I'll get some Italian bodyguards. - The house... - Is the least secure of shelters, It's obvious. Given that the kidnappers know you're here. We must find a place where nobody would think to look. An insane asylum... a prison a political party... Or a brothel. Just an idea! I have a friend, completely trustworthy, who runs a sort of... Clinic. A place of rest for exhausted feminists. It's... calm, discrete, classy, you know. Importantly, the bodyguards watch always over the safety of the clients. whom the director of the house knows personally... and intimately. Away from Carolina, I wouldn't feel comfortable. Naturally. But it's not your peace of mind that counts. But the protection of her body. Of her body... It's important that Carolina leaves immediately. Erika my friend, is right now in Paris and could accompany her. Is this place far from Paris? No, not too far. For extra precaution, Carolina will dress as a man, In one of your suits. No, it would be too big. Better one of mine. By chance, I've one in my suitcase. Since I don't have time to go home and change. I understand that these precautions will seem ridiculous, But we can't risk anything, when it's a matter, not of saving a soul, which can always be repaired but that of a young body. Yes, we must save her young body. I hesitated at first. I made some objections... But finally I accepted. Your empire, and the flesh of your flesh... will perish. - Can you give me a shirt, please? - Yes, Maria. This one here, Miss? - Yes, Maria. Come in. - It's perfect. - As if it were made for you. I'm afraid the jacket might not fit so well. Matteo, would you call a taxi? Sir doesn't take the car? No. I prefer a taxi. We need a moustache. Nothing easier. Ah, a false one! Naturally. What'd we do without makeup? - You didn't know? - No. Oh Miss, you look adorable. - No, hands off, Maria. If Matteo and the cat don't satisfy you I'll leave you Mr. Frantz! Have fun. Did you hear what Miss said? Oh really... Must I do everything myself? I'll give you a hand! Not now, it's not the time. I feel embarrassed. With the eyes of the public staring at us. - I'm used to it. - But I'm not. Kidnappings. How romantic. Unfortunately it's no longer what it once was. In olden days, fair beauties were abducted by horses. Raped by swans, seduced by snakes. Torn apart by bulls... pleasures past, unfortunately. Times change. - Swans? And how did they do it? - I'll show you. I admit that it was full of attention and kindness. and love was made in a way technically correct, but nothing more. As a memento I took the gold chain, that Carolina always wears around her waist. and that she had forgotten to put back on after removing it to put on her trousers. 'What I didn't understand is if it was Frantz disguised as woman or a woman disguised as Frantz.' Don't say anything. You're waiting. Madame, will be down. Here, my Lady, your new, little pupil. A first class purchase. Carolina De Saxe, Erika Von Eigher. Needless to say, that this is a false name. Thank you for the welcome. Don't thank me. The pleasure will be all mine. The young lady should change out of her disguise. That is no longer suitable to her circumstances... now. Although, maybe... on second thoughts... You will find a dress to fit you on the couch in the lobby. Hurry, now. 'The pleasure will be all mine.' You can tell. Look at me, however, working in this film. One of these days I'll get bored, and send them all... Come on. In here it's so much larger than it seems from the outside. Yes, it wasn't easy to manage it. And also... Very strange. Who are those girls dressed in black? The guests of the house. Why dressed in black? It's the rule. To distinguish them from the maids, who wear white. Why are they so still? They're resting. Well then, will I also always have to... wear black? - And all these doors? - There are many rooms. - What do they mean, these photos? - Only what you see. Only portraits. And this is your room. Is she a good pupil? If she's not docile, don't hesitate to punish her. Cruelly. It's already been done. See the effects. Reverence... I am yours, Ma'am. Uniform of the house. Get up. Is she a real whore? Here's a certificate to prove it. Where's her beat? Palais Royale. And... her price? Third category, Sir. Unwrap it. Immediately, Sir. Yes, seems fresh. I'll have it with a salsa rossa. and flamb au cognac. Very good, Sir. And the serving? Would you like it sliced? If it's home made. And is it tender? Naturally Sir. Add a little something as precaution, so that it rises properly. Unnecessary. But, I'll do as Sir wishes. I've everything needed here. The doors, corridors, photographs, keys. The names on the doors. My own photo, and my own name. I wanted to close the bolt, but it had been unscrewed during my absence. My legs were weak and my mouth dry. I saw a bottle on a tray, which seemed to be water for the night. I drank a full glass. But I soon realized I'd made a big mistake. I beg you, Sir, hold back from performing an irreparable act. That would put in danger, her that God was putting under your protection. No acts of violence in this sacred place. Come on, let's hurry. Come in. Hello baby. Isn't it locked? It was removed. Removed the lock? What do you mean? It works perfectly. Ah, so it does. How was your night? Strange things happen in this house, It's a mysterious place. Mysterious? No. Why? I find it quiet and comfortable. Have you seen the people? I found it a bit... deserted don't you think? Why do they lock me in? As a precaution, no doubt. And who gave you the key to my door? The guard, who else could. But you saw the room of portraits? Yes I glimpsed it as I went by. An interesting idea, don't you think? Why are you so nervous? I had a bad dream last night. There was a very strong, tall man who was washing my body. You should take a tranquilizer. I've one with me, if you want. Look there! It wasn't a dream! The stick he had is still there Don't be silly. It's my umbrella. I put it there when I arrived. Here. Swallow, now. Now, don't be naughty! Even as a child you had strange, morbid nightmares. There's no reason to worry yourself. I contacted, despite everything, your potential kidnappers. As if you really were taken. I am taken. But no, you're here. So I went to the appointment marked on the card. It was the first time I've climbed the Arc de Triomphe and will certainly be the last. Yet I'd like to have taken you there. One day. And when I did. It was if it were once, many years ago, when you were a child. And I held you by the hand. I see that you too take little children for a walk. It must be a kind of password. My stupid bosses didn't warn me. Fine weather, is not it, to visit the capital with your family. It's true, the sun, the wind, the rain, the smell of the air, the day dawns, the night falls, and so on... It so happens that I've brought with me a little something. Memento of Paris. Like the obelisk erected facing the Arc de Triomphe. And the flesh of girls offered in the secrecy of brothels. Does this bring anything to mind? Ah, thank you. I wondered where it had got to. The chain, of course. As for Carolina, alas, you know her cruel fate, and you know the price, to save her from it. You'll take a cheque? Why not notes, seeing as it's you? Cash then. Ah, that lack of trust. Used, in small denominations. Let's say, 10 francs. And more convenient with the current cash crisis. ten per millimetre, about... Yes, more or less that's a column fifty metres high. So much? Of course, and very cumbersome. Not to mention the hard work involved, to obtain them discreetly. That's none of my business. I carry out orders, period. Get thinner bills, or renegotiate the deal. The orders on this point are precise. Small used cuts enclosed in a bag of new cement. Deposited on a construction site, which is at kilometre K, on street X. Here is the scale map. Here, right here in niche C. Just to the right after passing door P. Got it? You know very well there's a credit crunch. I'd rather pay you in several installments. However, take this in the meantime. Three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. That country bumpkin. Hoping to impress me with the efficiency of his organization, forced me to accompany him to this lousy night club. In twenty seconds, the girl that you're looking at will be called to the phone. She won't return. Is the ransom considerable? Professional secret, Mr. De Saxe. Miss Diana Wanderbergh wanted on the phone. Beautiful victim, don't you think? Pitiful and tender. For the pleasure of our sadistic customers. Done capable and recruited. Come on, get up. You must be ready at seven for a difficult customer. There's still time. Do you want to be punished some more? - By you? - No, by Erika. She always inve those little things that really hurt. Remember? Yes. Only you lose, not us. There are always customers that appreciate the show. And even the ladies. Yes, I know. Don't you want to make love some more? No, there's no time to lose. Business before pleasure Do you want to do... Practice violence? It's work, eh? Wait, lady, we'll help you. They're real peasants, up there. You can manage better inside. Done. Capable and recruited. Exciting, don't you think? For you Sir, special offer: Let me go immediately. Or I'll call the ambassador of my country. If you like, we could put her in a position, more comfortable. You know, it was inevitable... two or three of our men raped her. They are entitled, by contract. Unless it's a special case, this... I beg you, Sir. Tell them not to touch me. My father will pay whatever you wish! Of course he will pay, but this... doesn't give you the right to privileges. Even admitting the show was pleasing, I don't think it was very prudent to show me. I could recognize the places, give directions. No Sir, it's not possible. Think of your dear little Carolina, and what could happen to her to amuse you. Burned alive, for example. But we can do better. As for this, it's a temporary haven. Perhaps tomorrow, it will no longer exist. No! No! Let go of me! Let go of me! I beg you. If you're not a good girl we'll burn the tips of your breasts. Don't spoil her too much. She must arrive at her destination in usable condition. No! There... Fire. Now, watch the birdie. Fire! The client is waiting. Now, just as she is. OK, we're coming. Hello hello. How are you feeling today? This hotel doesn't offer many distractions - to a fashionable young lady. - No, I've no time to get bored. - The place is nice, isn't it? - Yes, very nice. So, all is well. I know your father has made several visits. Yes, I mean no. One that I know of. Do you need anything? - No, thank you. Well, all right then, I'll be leaving. Why are you so cold under my caresses? Come, tell me that you love me. Madam, I love you. And I am your slave. Or else I'll send you out into the gardens. I'll set the dogs on you. They'll savage you to death and devour you. Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona? Sweet soul, take heed of perjury! Though art on thy deathbed Presently. Talk you of killing, my lord? Ay, I do! Therefore, confess thee freely of thy sin. I never did offend thee in my life. By heaven, you have! I saw, the infamy, he blew his nose in your new panties, becoming more distracted. What use now your tears for those your panties! Drive me away my Lord. But do not kill me. This is a tragedy! Not a farce! Kill me tomorrow. Let me live tonight. Tomorrow I'll be busy. And certain things... are best done right away. But while I say one prayer. It is too late. Not yet quite dead. And still... warm... And soft... and sweet. I don't want to prolong too much your torment. Age? Eighteen. Her death was recent. Oh, and still fresh. How did she die? - It was sexual. - Particulars. Raped then disemboweled. By whom? By her confessor. The funeral service? Oh magnificent, it finished a few minutes ago. The funeral? When you are done with her. Ready, Sir. Set light to her. You're going for a walk? Good boy. Down boy. Ah yes, I'd forgotten the key. Listen Pierre Garen, are you whining or playing? OK, OK, I'll play. I can't see the cards. Damn. Fifty. Tell me where you've hidden the little De Saxe girl, or I'm folding. Each must do his own work. See you. I fill the boxes, the work is too hard. They leave it all to me. You just tell the boss you've found her and all's well. If he wants to check? Is that all? Tell him, you were at the top of the Arc de Triomphe, and when she arrived, you gave her a little push. And whoops, over she went. You mean the girl is already dead? No, this is a metonymy, not a hypothesis. If you don't understand, I can't do anything. He didn't understand for sure. I understand only that I've run out of money. OK. We'll play something else. The girl that's being sent back to her family... There are two hours left before delivery. What? She's being returned? Have they already paid? No. An error in the quality of the goods. We have contractors devoid of merit. Luxurious standard of living, but in debt. The bank refused the payment. Oh, shit. You see, they'll blame me. My pockets are full. The economic climate is most unfavorable. The banks are stopping their credit. And then people are more and more depraved. I don't know where it will end. I don't know what the clients have done to the girl, up at the villa. But it's nothing too orthodox. In fact she's still a virgin. Don't you believe me? Hey, lads! Bring the basket. Virgin? Very rare, today. Almost offensive. Ah, on this point, I quite agree. I'm a guy of normal appetites. OK then, let's play poker. No. Baccarat. Eh? It's more in your line. Baccarat. Remove the packaging. You're pigs! Nothing but sick. You bastards! Those fools must have forgotten the injection. I'll get revenge. I don't need the police. I'll find that dump... and with my friends we'll blow it up. You're starting to bore us! We're working here! Baccarat. That's it. My friend has won. He'll be the one to proceed with your deflowering. So you'll have at least something to tell to your girlfriends. Pierre Garen... You are despicable! I hate you! Missionary position, but tie her well. All beautiful women, young, rich. This is the twelfth for all we know, and no one has yet filed a complaint. This suggests that there are others. Hundreds maybe. - Classified information? - Undoubtedly. Perhaps we should summarize the facts for the public. Naturally. I've even prepared a note. 'The script seems always the same. Acquaintances of the beautiful, young lady X and young lady Y cease abruptly to see them in their surroundings. When friends ask for news...' - Am I being quite clear? - Perfectly. 'When friends ask for news from the families, amazed at such an unexpected disappearance...' Huh... unexpected... 'of missed appointments, of continued absence on the phone, the father, or husband, bring out apologies both nebulous and vague. Forced rest, unannounced trips... The last case of which we are aware? The last known case is that of Diana Vandenberg. Called to the phone, Tuesday evening at the club what's-it-called, never returned to her table, not only was it that... she...' What a way to write! Such a precious style, as if it wasn't already difficult enough to understand. 'Not, only, was it that... she...' In short 'She didn't return to collect her personal belongings. didn't even pass the cloakroom To collect her fur... animal unknown' Her friends called... Her friends called her house, Her father informs them that the girl felt unwell, and had to return home in a hurry. But this time, there are witnesses. Suspects, indeed. Yes, two. Two men, standing by the bar, and who watch intently the girl, Ahha, they've been noticed. They were noticed by those present. One was identified. Amazingly, it was the banker, Giorgio De Saxe who would even pronounce the fateful word: ransom. - Good, let him in. - Here he is, boss. You were by chance at time X on day Z, at club what's-it-called? Yes... that is no... Sorry, I don't remember. Don't prevaricate sir. Yes or no? Maybe in a certain respect... if I remember correctly. - You go there often? - No, never. Incorrect! That night you were there. So what? I mean to say that I don't frequent that kind of place willingly... Ahha! Then you had a special reason for going that night. Not at all, It was purely by chance. - And who were you with? - I was alone. Incorrect! You were talking with someone. - A casual acquaintance. - And who was it? I don't know. Have you ever seen this girl? - No. - You've never seen her? No, not at all. Another thing. You possess a Cobra revolver, very rare. The teenager was shot once in the Bois de Boulogne with a weapon of this type. Where do you keep the revolver? - It's been stolen. - When? I don't know. Thank you sir. And if you have other news on this case, call Commissioner Loran. All right. - Financial, status? - Precarious. - Moral reputation? - Very doubtful. He's trying to get a large sum for an unknown reason. The father of Vandenberg would pay any amount To rescue his daughter. Twenty percent. Thirty per cent. Taxes to be paid. All right. All right. I've come to suggest a walk Are you ready? We must always be ready, you know. Very good, very good. Then, let's go. Shall we walk in the house? - Oh, no, outside. - In the garden? - No no, in the country. Ah, right. And the dogs? What dogs? There are no dogs. The gate isn't locked. Of course not, why would it be? As a precaution I've been told. To only one who's a caution occurs a precaution. Ahha, mephitic wordplay. We can go out like this, freely? To hear you speak like that, one would take you for a prisoner. So you've found my trail. Happy? Yeah, sure. And little Carolina, you know where she is? Hitchhiking down at the crossroads. She went in the hotel to telephone. However I don't think that will take long. Well then, good luck. Hello, this is Carolina. Yes, there's been a bit of a mix up. A mistake from a typist has led to the reversal of some sequences. But now it's all been tidied up and everything's running smoothly. I'll have a bag of cement shortly. If there are no other mistakes. Tell the public to relax. Oh, no! I've seen the back of you! What a mess! Within 17 minutes exactly, I will deposit a bag containing in a place provided by the script, The young lady was kidnapped? Not exactly, but the kidnappers believe so. I thought I'd give you the opportunity to arrest them. Very kind of you. Don't talk of it even to the Commissioner, just be on time because it's a lot of money. And money is expensive nowadays. Police. Nice work. Have you got your papers? They seem in order. I'm afraid the banker's making fun of you. You've been arrested for nothing. The bills aren't small denomination? Neither small nor big. The hiding place was empty. Skinflint! - Giorgio De Saxe? - In person. This is Commissioner Loran. Good morning. Well? The man who was with you at the club what's-it-called, has been arrested. So much the better. I was a bit offended by the fact, that you didnt put the money in the hiding place. What? We would have recovered it. We're honest police. But you haven't...? Help! Help! Aider moi! Aiuto! Socorro! Help! Died in a car accident. Which makes you think, according to the police, that it was murder. The car caught fire, before she could get out, tied and dazed. It was my fault, in other words. What a horrible thing. Carolina. Flesh of my flesh. Destroyed in the flames. And so for this... there's my revolver, despite the postal strike, It was returned to me this morning, by express delivery. - How are you? - Not too bad. No bruises? - No, everything went OK. Well, we won, as expected. I didn't understand the script at all. but in short, that's it. You have the money? The ransom? Of course. It's in the trunk. Alright then, let's go.
