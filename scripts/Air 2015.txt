Mr. President, given the severity of the current crisis... what is the risk to the American population? Our level of preparedness couldn't be higher. I am confident that we will prevail, whatever may come. But, Mr. President... Rest assured, my administration is taking steps... to ensure our way of life will continue. Mr. President, is that last statement connected to the rumours... of these so-called "Noah's Ark" facilities? We're hearing reports of scientists, engineers, doctors... being whisked away in the night. Is the government hiding these people in underground shelters? We have a number of contingency plans... in place, mainly to provide peace of mind. But let me be very clear. Our priority is the safety of all the American people. Sir, are we facing an impending catastrophe? Is the government deciding who lives and who dies? Plenty of words from this president but very few details. And as more time passes with no clear answers... the situation becomes more dire. This is Natalie reporting, Channel Nine News. You having a nightmare, buddy? Just let me out. Let me out. Please. Goddamn it, Bauer! Gotta loosen the arm. - Please quit playing around. Let me up. - Can't do that. Gradual transition to a normal air mixture prevents what? Oxygen toxicity. Which can harm which organs? Eyes, brain and... and lungs! You'd think that somebody that just slept six months... would be in a better mood. Why does my tank's cycle take twice as long as yours? Well, give it enough time, everything in this dump's gonna break. - Did you clock in? - No. Oh, come on. I just don't want the other facilities to think that we're.... What, dead? Come on. You can say it. It's not gonna kill you. How's the weather up there? - Nice day for a picnic? - Outside air toxicity's still in the red. Just like last cycle and the cycle before that. I don't know why you check anymore. All the other facilities have checked in. - Everyone's okay. - Thank my lucky stars. - Oh, not this again, buddy. - No, just a minute. I have an idea. How many times are you gonna do this? This piece of crap network wasn't set up... For direct communication. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, I wish I had the Internet. Maybe they'll be better prepared for the next Apocalypse. Better use the bathroom first, buddy, if you know what I mean. Hey, this is not funny. You don't think it's true? - What isn't true? - They're all dead. You don't need to remind me. Today's shopping list. Look at this. Man, I've seen that a million times. I got it memorised. No, no, no, it says there was some kind of seismic activity. - What? - Yeah, an earthquake. I know what seismic means. What does it say? Oh, this is not good. Look, if there's any sort of leak down here at all, this place... would be full of poison air from outside. We'd be dead. What else? Electrical systems, core structural inspection. Core structural inspection? That's a joke. This is an abandoned missile silo. - What about the tanks? - Individual unit diagnostics. - No way. - Unbelievable. You know what? I'll do everything else if you do that. Those sleepers, yuck, you know they creep me out. - No. - Come on. It's your turn this time. On three? One, two, three. Clock's ticking. Chop, chop. Doesn't he drive you nuts? I've gotten used to him. I've been dreaming of you. How's the diagnostics, buddy? Filter checks are good on all nine levels. No damage at all from that seismic activity. - What about the tanks? - Still working on them. Did you tell him about us? I'm waiting for the right time. You made a promise. I'll tell him. Tell me what? - Who are you talking to? - Nobody. - I hate when you do that. - Yeah. I hate when you talk to the sleepers. I find it creepy. They're just people. Yeah, you standing over them, staring at them. What does that make you? Sort of a weird pervert? Look who's talking. The chronic masturbator. Well, at least I ain't diddling some dead girl. She's not dead. She's waiting, like we are. Hey, don't you compare her to me. I work for a living. What do they do? Come on, you know they're important. Important, huh? What, this guy right here? "Herpetology." - What's that? Some herpes specialist? - Reptiles and amphibians. - You're a genius. - These people are seeds, Bauer. The last in the world. Knowledge and experience that's unique... Unique and irreplaceable. Blah, blah, blah.... You sound like a broken record, man. - They're the future. Have some respect. - Come on, buddy. Don't give me that crap. We waste our whole lives down here, in this hole... so they can survive? I understand how you feel. Doesn't it mean anything to you? - Working down here? Saving... - Saving the future of humanity? Come on. Wake up, push a button, change a light bulb, go back to sleep. Rinse and repeat, buddy. - Doesn't it bug you just a little bit? - No. You know we got the short end of the stick down here, right? What are you going to do about it? Complain to management? Yeah, I might. I think I'll write a letter. You do that. A gorgeous afternoon for baseball. The sun is shining. And we do wanna remind everybody who's out here enjoying the game... that these teams are donating all the proceeds of tonight's ticket sales... to the relief effort after last week's bombing in Europe. So we thank everybody for their support at this terrible time. "Probabilistic calculation of Air Pollutant Dispersion." Bingo. What's that? Little light reading for the crapper? "This equation can be used to calculate time remaining... until viable surface re-habitation." - Ball two. - Listen to this. - Pitcher's a little bit shaky. - Listen, listen. "Parameters are, cross wind dispersion... concentration of pollutant, horizontal deviation," right? - Right? Listen to this. - You can almost see the homerun... in this guy's eyes right here. "Optimal scenario for re-habitation is 30 years. But this figure may deviate upwards of 150 years." Did you hear that? You've watched the game 100 times. Here it comes, here it comes. And there it goes! I'm saying we might not be stuck down here for much longer. Yeah, just another hundred years, right? Blink of an eye. Says here it could be as little as 20 more shifts. Buddy, that's for a weather forecast... which is 50 percent right 10 percent of the time. But you just keep on reading, all right? We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to bring you this.... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before. We've just received confirmation of a series of explosions around the world. Buddy, it's your move. Major cities such as Munich, Tokyo, London and Brisbane were targeted. What's it gonna be, Mr. Kasparov? Reports are coming from reliable sources from inside the government. May not be official, but.... Now this isn't official, but we're hearing that these attacks could be... similar to the hybrid nuclear and chemical weapon that devastated... Tel Aviv earlier this year. The president has now raised military readiness to DEFCON One... which is the highest threat level this country has ever been in. There you go. You got six more months to regret that move. - Wait. I thought we had more time. - Nope. Like sand through the hourglass. - You check these diagnostics? - Yeah, yeah. Just about to make our sleep cocktails. Good. I got a date with Miss 1979. Back to sleep? That's the routine. We'll be together soon. There's nothing to be afraid of. I tell myself that every time. My brain knows it. But my body tells me that I'm about to climb into a high-tech coffin. - Have you forgotten already? - Please, Abby, I've got work to do. Think of how good it would feel to touch me. Oh, no, no, no...! - Bauer! Bauer! Open the door! - What the fuck? I need the fire extinguisher, please! - Not a good time, buddy! - Open the door! Come on! I need the fire extinguisher! There's a fire! You didn't have to rip it apart. - Yeah, well, I thought it would help. - That's not right. Hey, you were responsible for checking the diagnostics! Hey, you hurt? - Let me see it. - No. Oh, come on. Stop being a baby. - How'd you get that? - From your stupid tank. How am I supposed to take care of myself now? - Use the other hand. - What if I need two hands? Shit, we're out of air. I don't know what we're breathing. There's not much left of it. - Come on, what does that thing say? - One second, one second. Bingo. "Emergency release via Safety Reserve Cylinders." Here, let me see. You're gonna love this. Looks like we gotta go up the Airway Routing Chamber. Come on, it's not any harder than getting in your tank. Exactly. - Did the book say where it is? - Somewhere in this jury-rigged operation. Why don't you check over there? - Wait, did you say red valve? - No, don't touch that one. Red's the air outside. Hey. Found it, over here. Emergency air and power supply. Yeah, here. Is it working? Shut up, man. Save your air. It's not working. Still nothing. - I had a wife. - What? Three little girls. I thought "unmarried" was one of the job requirements. I lied... to get the job, you know. Who knew all this end-of-the world shit was real? Before they locked the doors. Can you imagine what it was like for them up there? I'm sorry. I had about a minute. I could've gone up, been with them. And they sealed us in. There's nothing you could have done. You don't understand. You don't have a family. I can imagine. No, you can't. It's just you and me now. We're a family. Reserved air just kicked in. Time to make our next move. Let's go, clock's ticking. Where the hell are they? It doesn't say. Maybe you're looking in the wrong section or something. "Deep Sleep Vessel, Service and Replacement Instruction," right here. Man, I told you this is a half-ass operation. They don't even have spare parts for us. No, the parts are down here somewhere. They have to be. You see, this is what happens when you slap things together at the last minute! This is not the only storage room. Man, I know every inch of this place. This blueprint isn't gonna help you. Long-term storage. It's just a load of crap for when the sleepers wake up. We're not maintaining that area. - What are those numbers for? - I don't know. - It should be safe, right? - It should be, it's within the main seal. The only reason it's blocked off is to save oxygen. I bet the spare parts are in there. All right. No second chances. All right. This place is creepy. - It's like a cave or something. - Stop. Scared, buddy? Just feeling a little claustrophobic, that's all. Cut it out. Cut it out! What was that? - Maybe it's an animal or something. - How? - There hasn't been any oxygen in here. - Oh, yeah, you're right. Come on, let's try this door right here. Come on. Hey, Bauer, what's this? That's a Jacuzzi. What's it look like? What are these cameras for? They don't show up on our monitors. That's the old security system. Watch out for Commies. Do you think any of these still work? No. There's nothing here. Let's motor. - I'll start over here. - All right. All right, bingo. Someone's record collection. Abby, Abby, Abby. Bauer! I found it! I found it. Oh, yeah. All right, I think it's ready. What do you mean, think? I'm ready for bed. I should go in first, just in case something happens. Nothing's gonna happen. We did it. - Did we? - Yeah. Jump in. Gotta get back on the horse. Let me just check something. Just a minute. Fine. I'll pinch hit. You run the diagnostics. No, I should do it. It's my tank. I should go in first. The sooner we do this, the sooner we get some sleep. - Sure about this? - Yep. If anything seems off, just give a sign. - Zip me up. - Okay. - Ready? - Yeah. Hey! - Yeah, what? - You hear that? - I don't hear anything. - Sounds like a leak. - Really? - Yeah. And the air is definitely getting thinner in here. - You sure? - Yeah. - Check the air pump. - Okay, let me check. Cartwright? Hey, let me out of here. I'll check it. I'll check it myself. Cartwright! Cartwright! Cartwright! Bauer! I'm so sorry. My God, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? You okay? Where were you? I was calling your name! I was right here! - What happened? - I couldn't get the tank open! - So I was looking for something to cut it. - What took you so long? I just told you. The box cutter, I couldn't find it! - What happened to the tank? - I don't know. Maybe I missed something. - You missed something. - It was an accident. It would've been so convenient for you, huh? One tank between the two of us. - All your problems solved. - That's crazy! It's my tank! I was supposed to be in there! But you insisted. - Did I? - Yes, you did, remember? Remember? I did. You're right. - I'm sorry. - I'm fine. This might be a stupid question, do we have parts for that? I don't know. And that's all the reserve air we got. All right, change of plans. All right. Which one looks good? Good for what? All right, maybe not that one. What about this guy right here? "Ichthyology." I don't even know what that means. We can't just open one of the tanks and put me inside. Yeah, why not? What about the person who's already in the tank? What happens to him when we pull him out? - Well, I guess we kill him. - What? The only reason why we're here is to keep these people alive. They're the last remnants of human civilisation. Fuck them. We can't just decide who lives and who dies! You know what we can do? Take care of ourselves. No, you know what? Take care of each other. That's what families do. Now, you need to pick one right now. All right. All right. Morphine, good idea. Ticket to paradise. Give him a heavy dose while he's still inside. Don't do this. What choice do I have? - There's another way. - We don't have time. It's as simple as ABC. Hey, what's the matter with you? - I can't do this. - Yes, you can. No, I'm not doing this. Fine. Give me the needle, I'll do it myself. Listen, listen, listen, there's another way. Look, I know this breaks your soft little heart... but sometimes you've gotta sacrifice a pawn to stay in the game. - Don't let him. - I said, I'm not doing this. - Don't you wanna live? - It's murder. - We're techs, Bauer, not murderers! - Come on. What happens if they find out through the next facilities? Take a look around, man. We're the only ones here! It's not murder, it's survival. Listen, we have an obligation to keep these people alive. You're a piece of work, man, you know that? Did you feel that? That's what it's going to feel like when the air runs out down here. Your lungs starving for oxygen and there isn't any. Look, someone's gonna die, I'm sorry. But you are not leaving me here alone. Please, don't do it. You'll thank me later. - That's enough. - What are you gonna do with that? You gonna stab me with it? Go ahead, cut my throat. - Solve all your problems. - Listen. Try to save a guy's life and he kicks you right in the nuts. - You don't understand. Listen. - No, you don't understand. These people, they got their ticket to the future... by stepping on people like you and me! You wanna trade your life for one of theirs? I told you, I have an idea. Now are you with me or what? Yeah. Yeah, I'm with you. What are friends for, right? Man, I don't know. But the codes match. ABC 108 here. And ABC 108. I'm telling you, there's another facility, right here, next to us. - Maybe. - Come on. It's too dangerous, man. We don't even know what's out there. They checked in. Look at the monitor. There are people in that facility with spare parts. You're gonna have to break the red seal. - Okay. It's a risk. - It's a huge risk. This facility's a fragile bubble. One wrong thing and this whole place fills up full of contaminated air. Then instead of just killing one of them, we all die. We'll just have to make sure nothing happens. Can you hear me? All right. - Bauer... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, hugs and kisses. Good luck, all that. - Oh, shit! - What? What is it? - A dead body. A soldier. - Ours or theirs? I can't tell. Lucky he didn't shoot out the airlock door. Better luck in the next life. Come on, buddy, you're wasting air. I'm waiting on the air filters. Okay. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. Okay. Find anything good out there? Just dust. Blue dust. It's everywhere. Yeah, that's the airborne contaminant. You got 31 minutes left, buddy. If you're not back soon, I'll see you in six months. Trying to move people as quickly as possible... but there are rumours that these public shelters are not safe... against these chemical weapons. Oh, hey. I got you. Yeah, I see you on one of the monitors. You're right, those old cameras still work. Give me a thumbs-up. All right, cool, keep moving. All right, I'm just trying to figure out where the hell you're going. I think I've found it. Oh, you were right. It's stuck. Come on, you big sissy. Give it a push. I'm in. All right, say hi to the ABC people for me. - Bauer? - Yeah. I think we got a problem. It's not working. - Did the green light come on? - No, nothing's working. Looks like you're locked out, buddy. Hello! Hey! Hey, stop, stop, you're wasting air. Well, I was hoping somebody could hear me. Oh, shit, what do we do now? Sit tight, buddy, I'm working on it. Don't give up. What if he's right? What if there's no future? You've always found a way for us. I'd lose my mind without you. Hey, buddy. I think I found a way around it but you're not gonna like it. Just tell me. Back the way you came, about ten yards. - What am I looking for? - You'll know it when you see it. - You're joking. - Nope. There's no room up there. Come on, buddy, I've crawled through the exact same air ducts in our place. If I can do it, you can do it. Is there any other way? Well, if you want those guys to help you, that's your way in. Come on, it's a good way to cure your claustrophobia. All right. I'm going in. I'm coming to an intersection. Which way? Left takes you back here, so go right, right into their main ventilation system. - You okay, buddy? - Yeah. - This place is full of dead people. - Which way are they headed? Are they facing the same direction you're going? I can't tell. - The good news is, they didn't break in. - What? If they died out there, then the main ventilation system is still sealed. Hey, you do not want to throw up in your mask. Thanks for the advice. I got another idea. You can take your helmet off... join that little yard sale they got going on down there. Go to hell, Bauer. Bauer... the main filter? What? You're breaking up. - I said, can I bypass the main filter unit? - Yes. - Answer me. - Yes! Look, I'm gonna try to boost our radio signal. Don't worry about it. I'll be right here. Bauer. Answer me. Hey, Bauer, are you there? Bauer, are you there? Yeah, I'm here. I'm at the filter bypass. Hey, Bauer.... Do you hear me? I'm almost through. Good for you, buddy. - Wait, something's not right. - You're telling me. This must have happened a long time ago. You're breaking up. They're all.... They're all... dead. Unique and irreplaceable. They were checked in today, ABC 108. They checked in today and every other time. We saw it on the system. Do you hear me, Bauer? I saw it with my own eyes. It's a lie. The whole system? All of it. It's a lie. Can't trust anyone anymore. My God, Bauer. There's no network. No connection to other facilities. Just us and some computer telling us that we're not alone. You're not alone, my love. It's designed to keep us from losing our minds. Bauer, are you there? Where else would I be? If the system is a lie, automated... how do we know if there's anyone else out there? We don't. We don't know anything. We might be the only ones left alive. My God. I'm running low on air. - I'm on my way back. - I'll be waiting. As you always say, "Give it enough time, everything's gonna break." Guess where I found this? I don't know, where? In the toolbox, where I put it. And I remember putting the toolbox... right next to your sleep tank, within easy reach. Okay, so what is your point? Yeah, I couldn't believe it either... so I checked the video recording. - Just a minute, let's talk about this. - Don't bother. You should see the look on your face. You going nuts, buddy? Or did you really try to kill me? Just let me in. We can talk about it. Let you in? You have gone nuts. No, you're a danger to me. You're a danger to the sleepers. You're a danger to this whole facility. - Bauer, please. - It's not like I'm mad at you. No, I take it back. I'm pretty mad at you. Give me a chance to explain what happened. No second chances. Think of it as a mercy killing... like I should have done with my family. Nice chatting with you, buddy. Where you gonna go? You've got no air! I'm here. - Where am I going, Abby? - Breathe. Just look. You know what hurts the most? The betrayal and the lies. I trusted you. And you turned your back on me? Look, there's nothing out there. There's nowhere to go. Why don't you come back here? How does it feel, knowing you're gonna die out there? Answer me! I made it, Abby. Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Cartwright? Did I get you? Vincent Bauer, you don't have to do this. - We might be the only ones left alive. - Yeah? Is that what you were thinking when I was laying there dying? When you were looking at your little photo? I'm sorry, I made a mistake. Yeah, we both did. All right, enough of this cat and mouse crap. You know I can't let this go, right? Go lay back down in my tank... see if my best friend's gonna kill me in my sleep? Cartwright! Don't make me hunt you like a goddamn animal! If you don't do this, he'll kill you. It'll be quick. It'll be painless. You have to do this for us. You know how much this hurts me? - We're supposed to be family! Family! - Yes, she needs me! - Look, look! - Goddamn it! She does. I promised her. Look, look, listen, I can explain everything. Look, please understand. Please, she needs me. I promised! Abby, honey, I promise I'll never leave you. - I promised I'd never leave you. - Who are you talking to? - I'll never leave you, Abby. - Who are you talking to? I'm sorry, Abby! - I'll never leave you, I'm sorry! - There's nobody here! Nobody here! Son of a bitch. Cartwright? I know you're in here, buddy. You think I'm stupid? Think I wouldn't figure it out? At least now I know why this stupid job is so important to you. She was here all along, huh? Your lovely wife? You didn't want to decide who lives and who dies? Well, that's what it's come to. Cartwright. Come out here right now, we'll end this. I'll kill her. You don't think I'll do it? I'll punch a hole right between her eyes. You should see the look on your face right now. My ticket to paradise? - Come on, man. - No, no, no. Take care of your girl. Go on, man, the clock's ticking. I'm alive, Abby. But it's just me now. Keeping this place functional. Talking to myself. Sleeping in the bed of the man I killed. Just me now. And time. Abby.
