"Sir... sir. - Sir, why me... - Get lost from here!" Get out... get out! I am ruined because of you all. What will I tell my mother? Poor woman used to work in a collector's house. She dreamt that even I should study and be a collector. Why do you need to study to become a collector? You are anyway our collector. You only collect our money. I don't want to ruin myself further. "I will go to my village, at least I have my own house to stay. " Yes. It's a great thing to have a house. But what's the use of that house... ...where parents are after killing each other. It's better to be homeless than have such a house. Yes hostel is good at least I get good... ...sleep sleeping close to Mallika Sherawat. I lost my sleep when I was small. My father had two wives. One was my mother. And the other of the neighbor. Sou... teal Sou... sou... teal... ...sou teal... souteali. Her kids used to make fun of my dumbness. You still had a house. I neither had a house nor family. When I came to my senses I was in Jhamnadas orphanage. First I used to think that Jhamnadas only is my father. Then I later got to know that Jhamnadas expired when small. His father had made this orphanage in his remembrance. Then send them into an orphanage. They won't take you all in even there. I don't want to stay with you all. I am going. He will come back in that same speed he left. It's 10.30. "Gopal, he is talking to you. " What... tsunami? We are here only. "Hey man, we should have betted on it. " He came back again. Is this a time to jog! Ok Vasuli is coming. Hey run from here! Catch those rascals! "We are running for the money. " "We are running for the money. " "We are running for the money. "We are running for the money. " "Hey Gopal, hurry up! Run! Come on!" "Hey, come on!" "What happened, buddy? What happened?" We have taken it on installment... ...this doesn't mean that it keeps on stopping. - Man! "It keeps on stopping, what kind of a bike is this!" "What happened? - Hurry up, look!" Hey! Vasuli! Vasuli! "We are running for the money. " We will have to climb this gate. - Doors open too! Come! Hey! Who is it? Who is it? - No one. I am having this feeling that he saw us. Did he see or not? What he saw no one else saw that. - What did he see? He saw that we are four of us and oldie is alone. He will go inside and call the police. Then let's run. Yes. Anyway we haven't come to buy the bungalow. No... no... no... no! God! You know if there is any noise then I feel... ...as if our grandson Sameer has come. When Sameer will come he will come in broad day light. He will not come at night like a thief. Wonder whether he will come or not. He will come... he will come. America is not close by. You know it take 22 hours even by plane. Here it has been 22 years I had seen him when he was small. "I know and you are just living waiting for him, right?" Why not he is our only grandson and... ...if you go to see then he is our only heir. Really. See let him come whenever he comes. But till he comes we will have to live... "... being each other's support, right?" One... tell me one thing. "When he will come, how will recognize him?" You don't worry I am sure. - Yes. We... we will feel it on our own. "Come on, it's very late lets go to sleep. " Switch off the lights. What difference does it make whether there is light or darkness? We are destined for nights 24 hours a day. - Yes. Then why did you take a torch and go outside? Yes. So that the thieves don't get to know... ...that two blind people stay in this bungalow. Hey the oldie fooled us they both are blind! They are not deaf. "Kalengoor, last bus stop. - Last bus stop. " Chapel lane. Last bungalow. - Last bungalow. The name of the bungalow? Shanti Niketan. - Not Nari Niketan it's Shanti Nike... I said Shanti Niketan only. - Shanti Niketan. Which floor? - Who came? Who came? He is asking which floor. - Is your top floor empty or what? I said bungalow... bungalow! He is asking for which floor! Two people stay there an old man and an old lady. Both are blind. - Blind! Your work will be done. Hey where is Gopal? What are you thinking of? - There is an idea. What if I enter the house as Sameer? Hey what if they get to know then? They can't see whatever face it is what difference does it make? No... no it's a sin to do such. Hey think it's such a big bungalow. Our lives will be made. No problem of food and drinks! But you both will have to stay as Lucky. What do you mean? I mean that you both will have to stay as dumb and deaf like Lucky. No one will speak. Only I will speak. - Thank you. My head is blasting after hearing them talk. Hey! Hey see I won't be able to do this. I am going. Hey where are you going? Hey leave me. Hey what are you guys doing! - You won't listen! Where are you going? - Are you all not ashamed! You also! Hey!

Sameer! - My grandson? "My grandson, you came from America!" So why didn't you say as yet? - Surprise... surprise! How did you come? Flying. - You flied? - In the plane... in the plane. You came all of a sudden. You should have said that you are coming. You should have written a letter. Or you should have told someone. You should have called. - I saw Swades movie so I came. Swades. Hey Swades in Vedesh. Now you stop your military investigation. - Yes... yes... yes. My grandson has come after so many years. "Let him at least breath easy. Come... come son, come. " Come. You have come after so many years come. Be careful of the sofa. Come sit... sit. You have flied you must be tired. "Sit... sit... sit - That's it. - Hey where are you going, sit... sit.

"Three suit cases four plates, right. " "No... no... no... no not four today in one plate only you, I... " ...and your grandpa will have food together. Yes... yes. - Ok bring the food fast. Why is your voice coming from far away? "That grandpa, that... my stomach... " ...is empty so my voice is echoing. "Ok, it is echoing. - God! He has gone crazy.

Yes grandson has come so today... ...there will be pure clarified butter. "Otherwise no oil, no clarified butter for me. Dry bread. " Hey! I don't want to stay here! If we stay with him we will direct land up in prison. I am going. "You cannot go anywhere, you are my half body!" What do you mean that I am your half body? I mean for the oldie you are Sameer by body and I am from voice. Yes and these blinds are very smart. Once when they touch anyone they never forget that touch. "And even voice, now it will go on in the same way. " "I cannot do this. - You will have to do it, Laxman. " "Now this will only go on. - Oh God, what a life have you given. " Now what will happen to me? Nothing will happen; you are living such a life from so long. You speak on my signals! Hey keep quiet! "And Gopal, your this plan is going to flop. " I am sure that these two oldies are not blind. "That oldie was looking at me like this, you know!" Staring widely! - Hey blind people look this way only. Hey no that old lady also winked at me. She winked at you? - Yes. That means that she is 100o/o blind. She is not! - Hey you! See keep quiet or else I will make you... ...unconscious and then take you inside! See I...

"Hey why are you yelling, what do you think that I am deaf?" Shut up! What... what have you thought of ahead? "What have I thought, I will remove an x-ray of my skull. " And... and I will take a pain killer. "Will take a pain killer, you just do that only. " I will hire another professional killer. Go. Hey! - What! - Give Sattu Supari another chance please! This time I will go fully prepared. - You will go? Yes. - Then go. Hey why are you walking like this? Has a nail ever been stuck on your back side? - No. Then you cannot understand my pain. You all cannot understand my pain. I am going. "On that right side, it's much deeper that side. Yes. " Stop walking! Listen to me! No! I won't listen to anybody! You guys have got me stuck here. On top of that you don't allow me to eat too. Today I will jump from here and commit suicide. Hey! Lami! "My Laxman, if you died then what will happen to Nirupa Roy?" Nirupa Roy? I will call your mother Nirupa Roy. I can't call her Aishwaria Rai. This building is of 2 floors. "If you survived by mistake, then do you... " ...how much expense you will have to incur? "As it is, our financial status is not good. " Keep quiet! Because of you I am starving! And it is better to commit suicide than to starve! 1... - Listen! Where will your counting end? At 3. 2... This is not 'Sholay' type suicide. He is really going to die. He can't pee in the dark. And he will commit suicide! 23/4. Hey! Hey! What about me if you die? I won't be able to speak! And who will do my dubbing? Then come. You too come. It is better to end our lives forever. I am leaving. "Hey, Lucky. You have time, don't you?" Do one thing. Get another pack of snacks for me. Cold drink. Indian burger for me. Less spicy. "You were going to die, weren't you?" I will eat and then I will die. I will not die with empty stomach. Otherwise you will have acidity. - You! "If you die, then give me your watch. " "Now if you won't die, then I only will push you!" What a friend you are! You are not letting me to die peacefully too! You can live peacefully after your death! This is too much! I will not die! - Go! I am dead! - Without jumping? Oh God! She is that girl on the stairs! What! There is a CD on her? No! We had seen her on the stairs that day! Look! Other corpses too are standing in the queue. Cheap guys! Shameless! Aren't they ashamed to see a girl changing clothes? "I know! There is no decency in this world! - Yes, buddy!" They peep in other's houses! - Yes. What is she doing! We were looking! Fool! Gopal doesn't know the difference... ...between buying and making alcohol. Today I will drink to my heart's content. "Exactly my sentiments, buddy!" Why are you sitting woebegone? Then why should I do? "You guys don't let me eat, drink or commit suicide. " Keep quiet! Look at this! You guys don't even let me wail! Sameer! Sameer! I hope the food was sufficient. Did you eat properly? I hope the food was sufficient. Why don't you say something? I think you are feeling sleepy. "I lost my slumber a long time back, dear. A long time back. " Say something. Why are you angry? I think you didn't like the food cooked by your grandma. What to do? Since the time she has lost her eyesight... ...she adds sugar instead of salt and salt instead of sugar. Sometimes I too drink salty tea. Say something. Why don't you speak up. I think you are like your father. Till the time I wouldn't beat him 10 times... ...he wouldn't speak. Say! Say! Say! I too had beaten your father a lot when he was a kid! Say something! I think you like beatings from your grandpa! Say something! "Grandpa, there was betel leaf in the mouth. " I was searching for a place to spit. I see! You must have spited at a nice place. You eat betel leaf in America too? It is available there. "What do you think of America, grandpa?" In each nook and corner. What chatting is going on between... ...the grandpa and grandson? Nothing! I was asking how is everybody in America. And how is America. Everything is fine in America. - I see! And they both? Who? With whom you stay. Parents! - Your parents! They are fine. They are good. They miss you both a lot. "If they miss us, then why didn't they come?" "If they had come, then how would you have missed them today?" What does Sujata say about me? Sujata? Who? - Fool! Forgot your mother's name! Sujata! Who! - Fool! Your mother! Your mom! "Grandpa, she is fine. " I have been calling her as mother since childhood. So I don't remember her name. She misses you both a lot. Can I go to sleep? - What! Actually I have come from such a far off place... I see! Jetlag! Jetlag! He is tired! "Grandma, bed sheets. " Everything is there in the cupboard. 4 bed sheets. Why 4? - Why 4? It is very cold in America. So since childhood I have the habit of taking 4 bed sheets. Go! It is lying in the cupboard! "You will need it for cold and hot weather. Go, dear. Go to sleep. " "Goodnight, grandpa. " Hey! Have you forgotten the custom of the house? 'Jai Shree Krishna'. 'Jai Shree Krishna'. "Jai Shree Krishna', grandpa!" 'Jai Shree Krishna'! 'Jai Shree Krishna'! He forgets his mother's name. But he remembers goodnight. Forget it! Why does he need 4 bed sheets? There must be some reason. Why are you after it! "There are only 3 bed sheets here. - Not 3, 2!" "But we are 4 people. - Mind-blowing! Not 2, 1! Thanks. " But... Go away! Even I need a bed sheet! Otherwise I can't sleep! "You need slumber, not bed sheet to go to sleep. Go to sleep.

What freedom are you fighting for in the middle of the night? Actually... 26th January is approaching soon. I was rehearsing for that. I see! 26th January! It has gone. A few days ago. 15th August is going to come. - Yes. 15th August! 15th August! "Tell me one thing. You are Sameer, aren't you?" No! I am Ajay Devgan! Why! "Grandpa, I am Sameer! Your Sameer! Why are you asking?" Because since the time you have returned from America... ...you haven't asked about the box. "Box? Box! Yes, grandpa! Where is the box? I forgot. " That box is there. It is where it should be. You go to sleep. You go to sleep. What is there? "It is a mattress, grandpa. Mattress. " Mattress. Too much of dirt. Dry it in the sun. Dry the mattress. "Jai Shree Krishna', grandpa!" Goodnight. Sleep tight. "Not box! If there was a pistol, then I would have shot him. " Go to sleep! Go to sleep! It's paining a lot? Where is it hurting? Show me! Who is there? Who is there? I am there. What happened? Why did you whistle? Whistle? "Darling, after 40 years of marriage... " ...husband can only shoot his wife. But not whistle. Who is there? What happened? "Nothing, grandpa. Chinese cat. " Chinese cat. Chinese cat. Cat! - Go! "What? - Grandpa, cat!" It will drink all the milk! "I am observing, dear.

The hero breaks the glass and makes the entry in the Hindi movies. It is a great idea! Who will be the scapegoat? Me! Mummy! Who are you all! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! "Come on, boys! Come on. " Are you looking at us angrily? Or your face is like this? At least thank us for saving you from the rapists. Shut up! Who are you all! And how dare you all come in! You all ruined the rehearsals! Sorry! It implies they were not raping you? Oh God! No! This is the theme of our drama! What did I do? Aren't you ashamed! For spreading such rumors! Such a beautiful girl. Such... - Item... Such a rich girl! Decent girl! I am ashamed of you guys! "Sorry, ma'am! I beg your pardon. " "You... continue. Continue... sir, continue raping her. " Please! Please! Please! Go on! Please! Please! Go on! Please. - Your sister is calling. Great! I didn't do anything. I am a decent man. I was roaming on the terrace. "Drying my vessels. Sorry, drying my clothes. " He! - Hey! He! - No! He came and told me that a girl is there... ...and 4-5 guys have pounced on her. Even I was wondering that you don't rape... ...by putting on the music system. I am very sorry. This is not my fault. Liar! Cheater! I am sorry! Really! Not I! Not I! I came... he told me. He told me that a few guys are raping that item girl. Let's go and help her. To help her. To help her. Aren't you ashamed to spread such... ...cheap things about a decent girl? Keep quiet! God has given you the ability to speak! It doesn't mean that you will talk rubbish! Get out! She is asking you to leave. Come. I said get out! We are leaving! "Excuse me, ma'am. It is your fault. " What do you mean? "Your acting was so real, that we couldn't... " ...stop ourselves from saving you. Gopal makes us toil so much. And he himself bosses around and he relaxes. Hey You both are quiet! That's why I too am quiet. Otherwise I would have... You guys can just threaten and not do anything else. "If I lost my mind, then I will break his teeth!" You guys are laughing! You guys think that I am jesting! Let him come in front of me... "I will tell him that whatever she is doing, that is fine. " "And Gopal, these two scoundrels... " ...are provoking me against you. - Do you know? "If you will beat me, then I won't wash the vessels. " You are not washing it properly. "Look, this is not clean. Clean it again. " Come on! Come on! Come on! They both are blind. They won't know whether it is clean or dirty. "Hail Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Ram!" "Hail Krishna! Hail Krishna! Hail Krishna!" The worship is over? Isn't it strange? - What happened? Since the time Sameer has returned home... ...he doesn't allow us to do any work. He had stayed in America. And there you have to do everything yourself. Really? - Yes. "Greetings, grandpa. Greetings, grandma. " Niraali. Take the offerings. "Grandma, can I get some pickle?" There is enough! Your grandma's pickle has still tied me here. Otherwise a long time back... Again you have started. You sit. I will get the pickle. "Okay. - Come, dear. " "Come, grandpa. " What's the matter? Grandma seems to be very happy today. She is bound to be. "Her grandson, Sameer has returned from America. " Really! "Grandpa, did you call me?" I never called you. You have come uninvited. You? "Grandpa, your hot water for bathing is ready. Let's go. " "Come, dear. With your support... where did you go?" Come. It will get cold. - Yes! Yes! "Come. - Dear, you sit. I will take a bath and come. " Come. - Okay. Is there a towel inside? Or do I have to use my dhoti? Go inside. Everything is there. So you... - There is so much work! What! - I have to do grandpa and grandma's work! "By the way, what do you do in America?" I... I... in America... I fly the kite. - What! I mean I make kites. I have a factory of kites. Factory of kites! Strange! "It is strange here. But in America, it is in demand. " Less of flight and more of kites fly. Let's go out. Okay. I don't mind. - Come. Come. Your interest lies in what? Did you hear that? Your interest lies in what? He has come down to kissing in the first meeting. Let's go and see what he is doing! - Come! I mean what is your hobby? Music! Abhijeet Sawant! He is my favorite! Mine too. - I see. He plays guitar well. Guitar? He is a singer! He sings. Really? - Yes. Then who is the one who plays the guitar in the back? In the back? What do I know? - Forget it! That... your four sisters... - Sisters? I see! They! They are not my sisters. We all are paying guest. We stay together. I was wondering what your father does. - What? I mean what is his profession? He has a business in Ahmedabad. I see. And what do you do? I want to be a fashion designer. Right now I am awaiting my result. By the way nowadays we are organizing a couple's car race. We will donate the money to people affected by rains. That day I too got drenched so much. But you were in America. What! Yes! Yes! Come! - You are a jolly person! Come! Come! Come! That day if I too had got drenched here... ...would you have helped me too? Of course! What I was saying... - Yes. The couple's car race that we are organizing... ...I had given this idea. I love speed! You know! And I will support Monty in tomorrow's race. Monty? Who? That rapist? Yes. He is my good friend. - I see! And I am sure that he will win! "By the way, I have never been defeated. " Really? Then do one thing. You too participate tomorrow. Yes! I don't have the license. Somebody laughed. I don't have license of this place. I have America's license. I don't have license of this place. So I was saying... Who has locked the door from outside? Open the door! - There! I will come. You don't go. - No! No! I am here only. Hi! - You all... We live here only. - Here? Actually we want to ask many things from you. "For the moment, forgiveness will be fine. " Thank you. Sorry. Me too. Actually we ruined your rehearsal. They couldn't even rape you properly. Very sorry about that. Its okay! And you will not say sorry. Am I right? He will not speak! He will never speak! He is like this. "By the way let me introduce you to my darling servant, Lucky. " "My laundry boy, Laxman. And my cook, Madhav. " "Say hi, boys! Say hi! - Hi!" They are your servants! They have worn good clothes. I guess you pay them well. Actually I... "Let's go, Niraali. We will talk on the way. Come. - Okay. " Put this in the vase! Come! Come! Come! "Back to work, boys! Back to work!" This Gopal! He makes us the servant! And he went away with her! How far will he go? He doesn't know how to drive the car. I will win tomorrow's race. - What do you mean? And my trophy will be Niraali! But where will the car come for us useless people? I will arrange for that too. What are you going! "50! 50! How much! 50! ' - Excuse me, sir. " Madhav! - Hi! Aren't you Madhav! No! He is calling you Madhav! Then he will call you Laxman! Then he will call you Gopal! No! Absolutely no! This is Ceo. - And that's Dinky! "Madhav, did he recognize us?" What is the lady saying? She is saying that she wants a nice car. A car that will suit my Dinky! - Yes. "I see! Ma'am, look at this. 1965 model!" "Ceo, is he talking about the car... " ...or telling us his birthday! Dinky is so funny! She is so funny! Really! Come here! "Ma'am, look at that. A nice model. Just like you. " Let's see the model. Forget her. Come. - Come. Look at this! The latest and speed car! It is in demand in the market. And there is no such goods in the market too. "We don't want goods, we want car. We have goods. " And I will have to test drive it. Yes. Can we test drive it? Please. Let's take a test drive. - Thank you. Will you sit on my lap? Hold this! - Ophs! Take the chequebook. Fill in the amount. "See you soon. - Bye, cartoon. " Ophs! Wrong man! "Bye, sweetie! - Come. " "Careful, Dinky. " Dinky! Take a small test drive. Dinky!

Will you come for 9-12? You! It is your hobby to tease girls! Shut up! Why didn't you tell her something? You can't speak. I was just jesting! Why are you feeling bad? You know! You should be driving. Do you know Shubash Ghai? He is my close relative. But he is not launching me. And I want to be an actor. So unwillingly I only have to produce and direct the film. 'Uima! ' - What happened? It is the name of my movie! My movie's name! And I am the hero. Then what were you doing in Shanti Niketan? I am the 3rd actor! 3rd actor! You see I am making a movie on servants. And I wanted to know servants closely. Yes! I see! So you are a perfectionist? Always! Always! You must have seen how I had stopped at the race line. - Yes! Neither in the front nor on the back. Just perfect. Do you have lunch? Will you have lunch with me? Today I... I mean... - No! No! No! "Look, my perfectionist heart will break. " Like how you broke the petrol's tank. "Golmaal!" Its mine! "This prize belongs to you, Niraali. " This fool had made a hole in your tank! So that you lose this race! His face is like mine! There is anther like me! Idiot! I had taught you driving! - Liar! Not to cheat! - You are lying! What I thought of you and what you turned out to be! "Let it be, Niraali. " It is futile to lock horns with such filthy people. "We will spoil our mood. Come, I will escort you home. Come. " You can sit anywhere. I will not spare you! I will not spare you! Lunch? What about lunch? Where are you going? We will have to do something about this Gopal kid! What about the kid? He is still not born? Do something about Gopal. But what can you do? You want to say that I can't do anything! No! No! You can do something. In front of him you can plead and implore. "You are talking too much, you dumb!" What is his fault? Vent out your anger on him. If you have masculine powers. I have masculine powers. I will not spare him! Try it. - You too! Yes! That day Gopal call you a 'Bawarchi' in front of Niraali. "Still you kept quiet. Yes, but what can you do?" You know why I kept quiet that day! Because 'Bawarchi' was a great success! So many people have remade that movie! Otherwise I wouldn't have spared him! I swear! "In spite of wining the race, you couldn't impress the girl. " "But what can he do, Lucky?" You are talking too much! Listen! - Forget it! But what can you do? What I can do! I... have decided. - You have made a correct decision. You can't do anything! I can't do anything! I can't do anything! Now I will show you what I can do! I will... What can I do? What can I do? "You can break his bones, break his teeth... " "... make him crippled, if you are one father's son. " No! - What? You are not one father's son! Not that! All this used to happen in 1980's movies. Breaking legs. I will break his skull! It is a slow torture! Really? He is exaggerating. What did this dumb man say? He is saying that you are doing the right thing! We can't say that in front of him! See to it that he doesn't survive. If he survives then we won't survive. Are you encouraging me or scaring me? No. You be strong. You just wait and wait. I will smash his skull in such a way that he will become blind. He will keep on saying sorry for his entire life. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! His skull will smash. Good! He will become blink. You will go in the prison. I am not interested in this. Niraali will be mine. Hey! - He has come! Hey! I want to pee! "Fine, I will keep the bathroom ready. " You first go and smash his head! - Thank you. I thrash him! I thrash him! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Let's go and check! Come! - We are with you! Come! Hide your face. What have you done? I think you have killed him! I didn't kill him. I just smashed with the rod. But you were only going to make him blind. He is lying unconscious. Who is he? Did you see a ghost? Who is he! What is he saying? "Today you won't say anything, my friend. " He is saying that he is hungry. Keep quiet! I will... - Where did he go? I am asking who was he! - Is grandpa in some mess? I didn't expect this from grandma. No! It could be grandpa too. But Gopal you are very nice. "Nobody will hit you with the rod. Come, I will serve dinner. " Have you cooked the dinner? - You have become so thin. You go. You take a holiday. You can't do anything. Go somewhere. I have some other plan. Go. Hail Mother Mary! "Grandpa, shall I do more?" "Grandpa, have you quarreled with somebody?" Where will the blind man go to fight? It is an extended life. We are fighting with ourselves. I mean loan or something? I had given a loan. To your father. He repaid that. He sent you here. "You have arrived. - Grandmother, grandfather. " Bless you bless you. How did you come back again? - By ship. Did you not have the money to come in a flight? "I had grandfather, I was just going... " ...to set up my business but my fate turned against me. All of it became Loss Angeles. "Sameer, this is our servant Pandu. " "Okay Mr. Pandurang, when will you go back now?" "Come on grandfather, now I will... " ...spend the rest of my life here near your feet. The poor guy works and saves... ...up money and then goes to Dubai to do business. And then looses everything and comes back here. What is this grandfather? What is this? I went for a few day and you kept a new servant. This is not a servant this is our grandson Sameer. - Stupid. You had seen him in the childhood. "He used to eat lollypop, used to... " ...wear half pant and used to do a lot of mischief. "Sameer, you are so grown up now. " You have become a man no from a child. Even you have become a monkey from a man. Who are you? - He is Sameer. You had seen him in the childhood. "He used to eat lollypop, used to... " ...wear half pant and used to do a lot of mischief. "Oh, this is Sameer. " Who is this? - He is Sameer. You had seen him in the childhood. "He used to eat lollypop, used to... " ...wear half pant and used to do a lot of mischief. "Okay, he is Sameer, he is Sameer. " He is Sameer. - Who is this? I told you that I am Sameer. You had seen him in the childhood. "He used to eat lollypop, used to... " ...wear half pant and used to do a lot of mischief. Correct. - I accept that you are Sameer. But who are the remaining three? You have come drunk again in this house Pandurang. That is why I was thinking grandfather... ...that why is he shaking so much. You keep quiet. "Grandfather, grandfather not three... " ...but there are four Sameer's. Grandfather he can see four Sameers now. What? What have you mixed Pandurang. Tell me what did you drink? Tell me! "Grandfather, I did not mix anything... " ...I swear by my mother. What? You are swearing by your mother after being drunk. "Grandfather I will show you, I mean I will let you smell. " What happened? - Grandfather... ...he cannot even walk properly. It is useless to talk to him. - Listen... ...we have to go to the temple. Sameer dear. - Yes. - Will you take us? This Pandu has become useless. You passport size photo. If you want to live here then mind your own business. "Sameer dear, today my wish is finally fulfilled. " "Here take this, break this into small... " ...changes and distribute them in the poor. It is a thousand rupees note. "Sorry grandmother, but I am the biggest poor here. " Sorry Lord. "It is the last. - Oh Lord, oh Lord. " "Grandfather you, I as about to come to your house. " "Why, is all the pickles finished?" "No, no actually there is a dance... " ...competition in my college in which I am going to take part. And I want to win this competition at any cost. That is why I wanted your blessing. You do have our blessings. "You will surely win it, okay. " Okay but only blessing s will not do. - Then? Both of you will also have to come. "Dear, both of us cannot come, Sameer is there. " Sameer will surely come. "All the best, dear. " "No, because they are blind they... " ...brought me here thinking that I was Sameer. "I did not want to hurt them, you... " ...also please don't tell them anything. For some time even I will get the... ...love of grandfather and grandmother. "And yes, best of luck for the dance competition. " I will pray to Lord that he should make you win. "Thank you. - Bye. - Bye, see you. " "What were you searching for? - Four anas, it had fallen. " I was searching for it. He is saying that you had not come in this room yesterday. When did he say? "The wind was blowing, the four anas... " ...must have come here I will look for it later. "Listen, what were you searching for?" "Me, nothing. - If I will hit you even once. " Then you will break up into pieces. I told you that I was not searching for anything. You people. - Have you ever seen a gang? No. - Do you want to see? - Okay. You don't know what a big mistake you all are making. If I hit you even once from the back of my hand you will die. There is also no hospital nearby. I will go I will go. I will go and teach him a lesson. I understood. You go. - You are the hero. That is why I don't want to get beaten up. Let us forgive him. - You can go we forgive you. You give and look for your four annas. "You lizards, gang bang. " I banged the whole banged together. "Get up, it is your good luck that I am not well today. " Otherwise I would have beaten... "... so badly, I would have bitten you so badly, get up. " Get up. Seems like the blind man has put... ...together an army or eunuchs. Wait! "What did he say? - He is saying that, wait!" I'll show you. - Take this kick! - Did you see Superman? This is called gangbang. What were you searching for? A suitcase and the key to its lock. You work here isn't it? Don't you know where the suitcase is? The old man. The old man is very cunning. He can hide the suitcase anywhere. "Mannerless, aren't you ashamed... " ...that you call your master cunning. Come on get out of here. Or I will put you in the cooker and sound the whistle. Tell him to talk with respect okay. Stupid he is talking to you with respect. - I see.

" They were playing here just now. "That red cap, red cap, red cap. " You are the rightful owners of this win. Where are the remaining three. The remaining three. - Yes. They are only my supporters I am the main person. I don't now what would have happened... ...if you all would not have come on the right time. Maybe you had prayed to God with... "... a pure heart for my win, isn't it? - Yes, with a lot of honesty. " By the way I am an artist. - Yes. And you? - I am very interested... ...in painting and dancing. But just with art you cannot run... ...a home. - Yes... That is why I even do fashion designing. My mother was a collector. - Ticket collector. "No, no a IAS officer. " I spent my childhood in richness. Then why did clean utensils in grandfather... ...and grandmother's house? Because my mother wanted me to also become a collector. And my want was Sadhna. - Your girlfriend. "No, no I mean the devotion towards art. " That is why I decided that no matter... ...how much I would have to struggle... ...I will never ask my mother for help. I believe in goodness and truthfulness. That is very good thing. I like good and truthful people very much. Do you even like me then? Did you forgive him for the lies he told? You had that dance competition... ...I don't know why he was so envy. As soon as your show started he... ...cut the speaker wires and took the CD out. Isn't this the one? - This. I will keep this. - Leave it. And said now I will see how she wins. "Then I explained to him, you fool the show must go on. " All the dance that I thought you when will you use that. "And I pushed him, that is when started dancing. " "Then I explained to him, that now go and say sorry to her. " "You said sorry to her, thank God you forgave him. " You see I cannot withstand lies. You cheater! - He is joking. - Shut up! - He is joking. He is a very funny person. "Niraali, there is a lot of space... " ...on my bike you know that. Should I give you a lift? There is a lot of space can I also come? We all three will dance and you will take the girl alone. Vasuli. "Stupid, here take ten rupees. " It is 'Nag Panchami' go and drink some milk. Was saying that I knew every corner of the house. "Nothing, you all can do nothing at all. " I will have to do everything. Go and do. Why are you crying like a girl? Show some anger. Are you a man or not? Gopal made such a big fun of you. And you kept quiet. Did your mother gave you education for this? She only gave me education. You did not let me give the exams. We had left you alone for giving the love exams. And your love story was about to be created. And he ruined everything. "Who ruined it, that stupid?" But in front of Niraali he even insulted you. At least I made a hole in Monty's car. "What did you do? - Dance. - Dance, yuck. " All you did was cut the wire. He took advantage of my good will. "Listen cut hi, cut him. - Wire. - Are you an electrician?" Cut Gopal. - I cannot cut anyone. - What? You cannot cut anyone. Did you forget what all he did with you? He snatched your room. And after coming here he even snatched your food. He even snatched your life. He even snatched your Niraali from you. - Correct. And do you remember that night. When you did not have a blanket to sleep with. Do you know where that blanket went? Who took it? You lost the blanket because of him. If I would have been in you place. "I would have bought a death cloth for him, a death cloth. " Then come in my place. I don't even have money to buy poison. You are crying for such a small thing. "Such a small thing, I am there, your friend. " I will give you money for the poison. Really I am telling you the truth. Really. - Yes. - Then okay. "Tea, tomorrow his morning tea will be his last tea. " What are you doing? - Dance. Gopal. - Yes. - Gopu. - Say! Hot tea. - Give. - Drink it. - Go from here. Why are you staring at me like dogs? Have you seen my face for the first time? "For the last time. - Why, are you committing suicide again?" Gopu please don't do so much hard work. I cannot see it. You please down for some time. You flop actor. - What was the... ...need to call me a flop actor? Whether I lie down or sit down... ...what difference does it make to you. "You are right, whether you lie down... " ...or sit it does not make any difference to me. But finally you are going to become late. Late Gopal. - Madhav please don't trouble him. How are you feeling? I am feeling as if two mice's are making noise in my ears. He can hear noises. - What else is happening? Just once I propose to Niraali. Then I will start a family. "You don't think about Niraali and the family, I am there. " How are you feeling heath wise? "Health wise, health wise some thing is happening to me. " My right hand is itching. "Right, first the left leg will itch, then... " ...the right then the whole body from the head to the body. "You do, don't you know what I do when my right hand itches?" "No, I beat everyone up. " "No Madhav my brother, don't hit him. " He is alive only for a few moments now. Come here you fool. "You hit, you hit if you want to die by hitting some one. " You go on hitting. What are you doing? Why are you hitting so hard. What are you doing? This is the... ...place where I wear my glasses. Why do you take everything so seriously? Laxman what did you do. If he carries on hitting us like this. We will die before him. "You stupid people, you are troubling me since morning. " "I asked for tea, there was only empty cup. " There was no tea in it. What happened? Who is it? Seem like he drank the tea that was meant for Gopal. What happened? What is he saying. He is saying that the tea Laxman... ...had made for you in that... - I had... ...brought ice specially for Gopal. And I had put spices in it and also red chilly powder. Are you making tea or a delicacy? Who? He will not die so easily. "I know those fools, even the poison... " ...must have been a fake. How will they save? Till when will they save themselves? What is it? Grandfather. What happened to your voice? I have a sore throat grandfather. "Tel me one thing, what is the time? - 12:05." "Oh, it is already 12 o' clock. " 12:05 come after 12 grandfather. "After that 12:06, 12:07, 8, 9." How is this? - No grandfather I don't wear flowery garland. And I don't have that habit. "This is not for you, it is for your grandmother. " "It is valentine's day. - Yes, yes. " How will this be? Is it nice? - Yes. "Okay, okay. " Nothing's gonna change my love for you. Is it okay? - From where did you... ...get the thought of giving me a flowery garland? I knew that you would forget. "But I have not forgotten, happy valentine day. " "Today is valentines day, that is... " ...why I was thinking that why are... ...you giving me this flowery garland so lovingly. Happy Valentine's day. How am I looking? - You are looking very beautiful. We used to express on the auspicious day in our days. "What can I do times have changed, modern times. " On valentines day when the boy tells his girl I love you. Then even the girl does not refuse. She accepts it and also says I love you. What will Sameer say if he hears? What will he say? He will say that even my love should... ...grow with life just like grandmother and grandfather. "Tell me one thing, is Sameer really interested Niraali?" You are... "No, she really a very nice girl Mangala. " "She is very nice, whosever house she goes. " He will be very happy. "That means I will have ton propose to Niraali tonight, Hi. " "They are mad, they are saying that... " ...I should go and propose to the girl tonight. "Is that possible? - No. - Shall we sleep. - Yes, come on. " "He is right, going to a girl's in the night. " That will make a very bad impression. "Bad idea, we should go and sleep. " You go I will just finish my work. - Come on. Will we sleep together? - Come on. Come on today is valentines day. "Golmaal" "Golmaal" Niraali. - All of here at this time. What is all this? - Today is valentines day. And it is already 12 o' clock. - So? So we have brought a gift for you. You go. - Go. - Here.

" Taking care of grandfather and grandmother. He wants a maid. "When I go on the terrace, I see... " ...you drying your hair in the towel. I cannot live like this. You kill me by giving me this. What are you doing? Why are you troubling Niraali for such a small thing. "I am there, I will give you poison and kill you. " What are you saying? - I am helping my friend. What is it now? - If you will give us an answer. Then there would be. - A settlement between us. How can I give an answer in just a minute. This is the question of my life. I will do one thing. I will come to your house at 2 o' clock. There I will say that who I love. "It is 12:30 now, only one and a half hour left. " "We will wait, take your time, take your time.

You have come to buy me. "Get out I say get out. - Get out, get out, get out. " What are all of you doing here? You also get out. Get out of here. God. Since when did you start flirting with the girl? And what is the use of flirting with her. Will you take him along for romancing her? I will not go. - I only said. You even started talking after seeing the girl. "I wrote, that you did not know till today that I couldn't speak. " That is why you misunderstood me. I am not like you all. - Okay. Mangala. - What happened? What happened to your voice? - I am Sameer. Didn't you have sore throat? - Now it is fine. It is fine? I thought that my wife has sore throat. This old man is so boding! "If I give a raw mango to him, it will get converted into ripe mango. " Get rid of him! Niraali is going to come. Grandpa. - Yes. Your walking stick. - Walking stick? Why? Don't you want to go out? - Out! No! Why are you sending me out? Somebody is coming? Who? Nobody! - I see! Niraali is going to come! He is blind and this is the state. If he was able to see... Then I would have seen who is coming. It implies Niraali is going to come. "Now dear, I won't go anywhere. " Wow! Let Niraali come. "Grandpa, Niraali is not going to come. " I too used to get rid of my father like this. "Father, go to temple. Go to the temple. " Did you have a love marriage? "Yes, dear. It was the first love marriage of an independent India. " First one. - What about grandma? Grandma too had a love marriage. Grandma too had a love marriage. "No, you... how did you enticed grandma?" Entice... is a wrong word. I mean to say how did you do that... ...that expressing your love to grandma. "Expressing love? That is an interesting story, dear. " Will it take time? "No, but you will have to hear it out. " I used to go to the jungle in the morning. At 6:30. There were no bathrooms at that time. Fool! Not bathroom. I used to go for a walk. My destination was in the jungle. I see. Mangala in the jungle. Shut up! And follow me! Grandpa's love story is running too long. Even Kumar Gaurav's love story didn't run so long. Hey! How long will we have to walk? Hey! Walk quietly! Did I tell you to come in the flashback? "Yes, grandpa. What happened next?" "Then a turn came in my life, dear. " What are you doing? - Cow dung. She looks like the heroine of an art movie. But she is our lady. It's just that she is looking young. Do you come here everyday? You too pass this way everyday. Why didn't you come yesterday? Yesterday was Monday. - Monday? The cow doesn't give the dung on Monday? I go to the temple on Monday. I have kept the fast of 16 Mondays. My mother says that I will get a good groom... ...if I fast for 16 Mondays. When you have found Somnath... ...then what is the need to fast for remaining 15 Mondays? Wow! He is flirting with her! "Why do you hover around me like a bee?" "Why do you glance at me so eagerly?" "Why do you hover around me like a bee?" "Why do you glance at me so eagerly?" "Are you crazy about me? - No. " "Are you some lover? - No. " "Are you crazy about me?" "Are you some lover. " "At least tell me what work do you have with me?" "Tell her that you love her. " "Why are you standing silently?" "If we had been at your place, we would have said it. " "Why do you hover around me like a bee?" "Why do you glance at me so eagerly?" "Why do you glance at my window?" "Why do you talk only about me?" "Why do you glance at my window?" "Why do you talk only about me?" "You come for my sake. - No. " "You sing songs. - No. " "You come for my sake. " "You sing songs. " "What lies in your heart? Only you know that. " "Don't feel shy. " "Call her near you. " "If we had been at your place, we would have called her. " "Why do you hover around me like a bee?" "Why do you glance at me so eagerly?" "Why are you carrying a gold bangle in your hand?" "I will give it to you and take you to my courtyard. " "Will you make me your beloved? - Yes. " "Will you love me immensely? - Yes. " "Will you make me your beloved?" "Will you love me immensely?" "Today I say that I love you. " "After expressing it, where are you off to?" "You should have thanked me. " "I hover around you like a bee. " "I glance at you so eagerly. " "Are you crazy about me? - Yes. " "Are you some lover? - Yes. " "Are you crazy about me?" "Are you some lover. " "Today I say that I love you. " Then only did we get married. "This is the story of my love, dear. " Over? No! After marriage for the honeymoon... Grandpa! - Yes. Grandma had actually called you to the temple. I think you have got bored. "No problem, dear. I will go to the temple. " But remember one thing in the matter of girls. "Your muscular courage... - Give us, God. " "Yes. Grandpa is there otherwise. Good luck, dear. " "Thank you, grandpa. " "All the best. - Thank you. Thank you, grandpa. " Don't lose hope. I will go and shave. How many times will you shave? "Not I, he is saying that. " Go ad open the door. Who would have come at this hour? Niraali! Good... Hello! - Yes. Listen! - Yes. I think I have seen you somewhere. "No, you must have seen me from behind. " Many people think the same thing... ...when they look at me from the back. Listen to me! - I will send somebody! Whom will you send? Why don't you look at me? I am looking at you. But since you too are turning around... Okay! Okay! Okay! I will stop turning around. But why don't you show me your face? No! I can't show my face to anybody! - What! Yes. I am going to become a father. And I am still not married. - What! I will go now. I have to go to the doctor. At least tell me where has Somnath gone? He has gone to the temple! - He has gone to the temple! Why are you applying soap all over your face? You have hair all over your face? Great! At what strange places do people have hair growth! "Tell me, Somnath... " He too went to shave? "Golmaal. Golmaal. " Who is there? I am the dean of Vicky- college. I want to meet Somnath. Have you ever met Somnath? No. I have never seen him. I have only heard about him. I am Somnath. Tell me. Really? You are... But just now a boy said that you have gone to the temple. He is my servant! I was going to the temple. My wife's broken sandals broke. So I came back. I am blessed or meet you! Are you blind? Yes! So what will you do! Nothing! Nothing! I am sad to hear this. I have heard a lot about you. A lot. You were in the air force. Then you became the advisor in... ...our college after the retirement. Of Sanskrit. Our entire college loves you a lot. "Fine, fine. Have a seat. - Thank you. " Be careful! - What happened? There is a table. Are you really blind? Don't you see that I can't see! - I can see! Do you see the clock? - Yes. Not that! This one! - I see! This one.

Now do you believe me that I am blind? "Don't beat me, sir! Sir, don't beat me!" "Now tell me, what work did you have?" "Actually sir, our college has completed 50 years. " For that we have organized a function. "I have come to personally invite you, sir. " What? What program is there? First there will be a dance of 'Pooja'. Who is Pooja? Who is Pooja? Pooja! Pooja! Archana! First decide whether it is Pooja or Archana! "Not girl, sir! Not girl!" That veneration of God! - Then? After that the drama that you had created for patriotism in Sanskrit. A program of that. After that... You spilt! You dare to spilt! After that a cultural... program... cultural. Don't you have a beauty contest? - Beauty contest? Beauty contest! Fool! Beauty contest! I will ask the committee and let you know. "Not committee, I want the commitment!" I want the commitment! Otherwise! Who is there? I think there will be a snowfall. "Greetings, aunty. You too are blind? You too are blind?" Do you think that we both... are playing 'Black' here? No. I thought that you both are playing white. Where is the belt in your neck? It was hurting me. So I removed it. But how did you know that I wear belt in my neck? I know everything about you! Aren't you flirting with that Rosy ma'am? I will leave now. You want to leave? Won't you have a drink? I don't drink! - You don't drink? Fool! Even I don't drink during the daytime. "She is talking about tea! Tea! - Yes, talk. " You are asking me so lovingly. So please make tea. Shameless!

Read it with Rosy. - No! No! Take it! Take it! You guys beat a not! Hail Mother Mary! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! I am Sameer calling from America. Who are you? Who are you? I am Pandu. "Look, Mr. Pandu or whoever you are. " Tell my grandpa that I am returning form America today. My flight will land at 1.30 in the night. No need to come to the airport. I will come on my own. "What happened? Gopal, what happened?" Sameer is coming. - What! Sameer is coming! Sameer is coming! Sameer is coming! Everybody is saying the same thing! Did you see this! I had told you all! Someday we will get stuck because of him! I am leaving! I say that you all too pack your luggage and leave! How can we leave like this? We should find such a house too. Where there are two old people! Both are blind! And they don't have any relative! It takes time to find such a house! You guys are worried about the house! This might become a police matter! I will not listen to anybody! I am leaving! Shut up! Let me think! We will find of some solution! Box! - Box! - Box! It must contain something precious. Yes. Like how they show in the movies. "Open the box. And it contains jewels, diamonds and gold!" Are you planning to steal this? What? "No, Gopal! No, Gopal!" "Gopal, what are you doing?" "Madhav, explain to him! No, Gopal!" Have you guys gone mad! "The family that gave you love, and shelter... " ...you will rob that family! We are not robbing the family. We are taking the box! You understand what I am trying to say! I think you shouldn't steal! We are not stealing! We are checking! "If we found something, then we will... " ...take the loan and then return it. "Gopal, this is sin!" "Look, this door is also not opening! God too is saying no, Gopal!" "Listen to me! Gopal, no!" I see! It opens from that side! I still say that this is wrong! - This is right! "If it contains some treasure, then I will make a movie... " ...and I will sign all of you! "Buddy, first let me open it!" "Stop, dear. You will need the key to open it. " We... I was just looking at it. I will tell you what it contains. This is your compass box. You were 6 years old when had insisted on it. And look at this. Gun. For 'Diwali'. "You used to run all over the house, shooting the gun. " And this is your car. You used to roam the entire courtyard with this. You used to play with this the whole day. "What is this, grandpa?" Ashes. Whose? Sameer's ashes. My grandson was born in America. We were craving to meet him. "But 2 years ago, in an accident we lost our eyesight. " "With great courage, I told my son... " ...everything about our accident. He couldn't endure it. And he left to come here along with... ...my daughter-in-law and grandson. He was driving to the airport in his car. He met with an accident on the way. Nobody survived. My son... my daughter-in-law... my grandson. Nobody. I couldn't tell Mangala this thing. Otherwise she would have died. Only I had to endure this shock. My commissioner friend made arrangements... ...to send me to America. And there with my own hands... ...I performed the final rites of my entire pedigree. When I returned from America... ...Mangala started asking me... "... how is our grandson, how grown up is he, does he talk... " ...and have you told him about me? What would I have told him? What could I have told her? I didn't have the courage to tell her the truth. Everyday I used to say that I will tell her today. I will tell her today. "Then... on the day I decided, God send you as Sameer. " But I had realized that you are not one but two. "And gradually I realized that you all are not 2, but 4." But I had no qualms with your lie. Because Mangala was very happy. She was very happy. But... if you left now... ...then God knows what she will go through. She will shatter completely. I am saying the truth. What is left to shatter down? You... such a big betrayal! These... whoever they are... I am not angry with them. Because they are outsiders. But you! You... didn't even let me... ...perform the final rites of my children! I wanted to embrace Sameer... if only for the last time. On my lap. You all... who are you all... who gave you the right... ...the right to play with an old couple's emotions! You all have committed a grave sin! Such a grave sin for which there is no punishment in this world. I have planned all this. They are not responsible for all this. Only I am responsible. Consider it my mistake or immaturity that I came here. But a greater mistake is that... ...the love and family that I searched for all my life... ...when I found that in you both then... ...I couldn't recognize that. And I hurt both of you. Whatever punishment you give... I accept it. I love this old man. Uncle has helped me a lot. Give me the urn otherwise I will thrash you all so much... ...that even the beggar will refuse to give you alms. Why do you want the urn? What happened? Give me one chance to atone for my sins. Trust us. Laxman. "Grandpa, come. Come. Grandma, come. " "This way, grandma. Come, come. " You did the right thing by sending uncle inside. What do you want? - The urn. This? - Yes. - Take it. "Boss, these are the same 4 guys... " ...who had thrashed me thrice. I have never seen him before. Did you get thrashed at the wrong place? "No! I swear on you, Babali-." Babali? Who? - He is the one. Imagine! Gabbar Singh's name in 'Sholay' is Sweetie. Keep quiet! Fire! Don't fire! I heard everything. I swear on Sameer's ashes. I am with you guys in this fight. So you have changed the side! Fire! Forgot to get the bullets! Forgot to get the bullets! "If the bullets are at home, then will you play hockey with this?" Thrash them! What are you staring at! Go up! Switch it on! "Golmaal. " "1, 2... " "Golmaal. " "Golmaal. " Gopal! Hang on! Hang on! Why are we fighting? You are not interested in the ashes. Do you want the urn? Yes! - Why? "Look, this matter is between us. " "Come, sir. "' "Excuse me, sir. You cannot go from here. "' Diamonds! - Diamonds! - Diamonds! "Hold this, boys!" What have you done! "He asked for it, so I gave him. - Fool!" Madhav! I have been searching for you guys since a long time! I have been running after you! Why do you want to ruin my career? Nobody comes to my garage. My wife has refused to come back from her maternal house! "Please, return my money! Please!" I am really sorry. You know I had come in the scorching heat... ...without any slippers to return your money. And you know what happened? - What? He robbed that money. Really? Return his money! When did I steal it! I have jut met! Don't act smart! Return the money! Who are you? The landlord! - Tell him. Look! He is Mr. Vasuli. And he is Mr. Babali! Babali! - Babali! We will tell him to tie us 'Rakhi'. "Hey, Babali!" Babali! Why are you laughing! "Golmaal!" "Golmaal!" "Golmaal!" Who is it! Gopal! Grandpa! "Babali-, it doesn't come out! It doesn't come out!" "Gopal, what happened?" Sorry! Sorry! Blood! What a nice... Don't touch it! - Okay! What happened? - He too... "It's really deep, man! - What happened?" "Everything is all right now. Come, commissioner sir. " Commissioner sir... I know what their punishment should be. After seeing what they all have done... ...all the four will live with us. - What! Yes. You all four will live as the Shravan of these blind parents. And Nadeem too. - What? You all will receive your reward within 15 days. Reward? For what? Reward because you all have nabbed a dangerous... ...gangster and got the diamonds too. So you will surely get the 10o/o of that. Great! - My money! They see rich people and they start begging. Get out! "Greetings, grandpa. Greetings, grandma. " You have come to take pickle in the hospital too. "Grandpa, you too!" "Tell me, which naughty guy have... " ...you chosen from these 4 naughty ones? I am here. Where are you going? I don't mind. Lucky. Doctor! But he can't speak! I know that he can't speak. But I wanted such a husband... who would listen only to me. And he himself should remain silent. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you have a sister? "Yes, I have. But she is 7 years old. Why?" We will have to wait for a long time. "Golmaal!" Action! "Is something fishy!" "We are troublesome, baby. We are great!" "Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!" "Otherwise we might lose the heart. " "Be careful. " "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "Is something fishy!" "We are troublesome, baby. We are great!" "Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!" "Otherwise we might lose the heart. " "Be careful. " "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "We want to put the money. We want to put the money. " "We want to put the money. We want to put the money. " "We want to put the money. We want to put the money. " "Neither the heart nor we are bad. " "What can we do if this world is bad. " "We teach them what they taught us. " "Let's have some fun. " "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "Is something fishy!" "We are troublesome, baby. We are great!" "Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!" "Otherwise we might lose the heart. " "Be careful. " "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "Golmaal! Golmaal!" "Golmaal! Golmaal!"
