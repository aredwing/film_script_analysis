That in their shapes and sounds... I could find everything|and see beyond myself... to something special... perfect. My father told me once... that I could reach|the ear of God. [ Woman ]|Eliza? ''Nozzle.'' [ Male Announcer ] From KQED public radio,|this is "The California Report. " I"m Scott Shaffer. On today"s show,|people from all over the country- [ Female Announcer ]...thousands of|supermarket clerks are on the picket line. 70,000 union workers at Vons- ...walked off thejob late Saturday|after contract negotiations fell through.

We"ve got Louis, Thomas-|We"ve got-So, that"s James. Uh, ''Aspects of Biblical Religion.''|Ron usually takes that. Look again. Uh, 1 90; Topics in Religious Studies,|the Upanishads. I could do that or- [ Speaking Hebrew ] [ Continues ] - Coffee? Thanks.|- On the stove. [ Mrs. Naumann ] You know that dinner|of yours? We used every pot in the house. - That wasn't worth washing a pot or two?|- Or 1 0. - [ Chuckles ]|- [ Continues ] - What's this?|- He's helping her with Hebrew school. [ Mr. Naumann ] Do you understand|a word you"re saying? - I understand a lot of it.|- Yeah? Okay. - Translate, hotshot.|- Um, it's about where Abraham sacrifices- - No, not sacrifices.|- ...uh, starts- - Yes?|- ...to sacrifice Isaac to God? - Yes?|- ...to sacrifice Isaac to God? - You're being a bully.|- A bully? [ Scoffs ] Maybe, but why shouldn't|he know what he's saying? Isn"t God in the words?|See, God is the words. The spoken words,|the utterances. How do we reach|the ear of God, Aaron? - [ Speaking Hebrew ]|- Exactly. You speak with him. It's ridiculous. MostJews don't understand|what they're saying in services. Well, that's what attracted me.|The mystery of it all. - I thought it was Dad"s cooking. [ Laughs ]|- Very clever. You missed a spot. You"re slipping. Come on. Let"s go.|Let"s play. Let"s go. - Come on.|- We'll finish this later. Hey, what do you think|about changing the tempo- [ Cello Tuning Up ] I love this piece.|You been working on this? [ Violin, Classical ] [ CelloJoins In ] - [ Continues ]|- Good night, honey. [ Rock ] - Hey.|- Could you drive me somewhere? [ Aaron ]|So, uh, what is this again?

Dad must be in Dad heaven. - He doesn't care.|- How can you say that? He loves this stuff. I put the letter under his door.|He never said anything. I'm sorry. [ Woman ] The spelling bee|is a truly American tradition. I"d like to welcome you to the|Oakland Tribune District Bee. Spellers, be proud. You are examples of the best|and brightest in our area.

''Saline.'' [ Mr. Naumann ]|So, a paradox. [ Mr. Naumann ]|So, a paradox. God is... everything- a perfect, luminous essence. But even God wants more-|to experience more, to give. So God creates a vessel,|a container... that can receive this...|gift of God's pure light. His divine light|pours into the vessel. - Come stand here.|- The vessel, of course... - can't contain the magnitude|of this light, and it shatters.|- [ Door Closes ] Destroying the vessel,|and scattering its broken shards... in a big bang of creation. Now, man's job is to locate|and gather these shards... to make the vessel-|our world- whole again. Now the cabalists called|this fixing, this mending- they called it... Tikkun- - [ Person Clears Throat ]|- Tikkun olam, the fixing of the world. Now, any act of goodness,|altruism, kindness... that contributes to that idea|is considered tikkun olam. It"s an extraordinary idea- that we|can restore what has been shattered. In fact, it's our responsibility|to try, each of us. Out of the very pieces|of the destruction... God has left us hope. - [ Chattering ]|- Polytheism papers due next Tuesday. [ Mr. Naumann ] Elly, this is fantastic.|Why didn"t you tell me? - I did, but you didn't say anything.|- Hmm? She thinks you've|been ignoring it. - I put the letter under your door.|- What letter, honey? - From Dr. Morris.|- Dr. Morris? It's probably in the mess|on your floor, Dad. - I'm really sorry. I didn't see that letter.|- She beat out a lot of kids. - Yeah?|- You'd have loved it. [ Laughs ]|Did you do that? Oh, man.|[ Laughs ] I got another chance now, don"t I? Because|you moved up to that next level, right? - The regional bee in Sacramento.|- Oh, perfect. Perfect. We"ll all go. This is really,|really important, and this- [ Inhales ]|This is a beautiful thing. Let's take this home.|We'll show it to your mom, all right? We'll put the top down|on the Alfa. Wow, what a great day! It's okay. Go with Dad. I'll, uh, see you at home. Okay, in the Chronicle, the Trib|and the Montclarion. Listen to this. - [ Aaron ] Wow.|- ''Winner of the spelling bee... ''that took place Saturday afternoon|at Albany High School... was sixth grader|Eliza Naumann. " ''Sixth Grader Bests|Middle Schoolers.'' [ Aaron ]|Let me see. - That's great. I'm proud of you.|- ''Naumann casts a spell.'' - You know, you've always been good at spelling.|- Yeah, but not this good. - It's not important.|- [ Mr. Naumann ] Of course it's important. You know, there are people|who believe... that letters are expression|of a very special primal energy... and when they combine|to make words, they- they hold all the secrets|of the universe. - You remember the Vikings?|- [ Phone Ringing ] Okay, the Vikings|called this epli. Now, when they took it across the sea|in their ships, it became apfel. Across another border,|it became appel. By the time it got to us,|it was ''apple.'' A-P-P-L-E. Its spelling|contains all of that. It holds its history inside it. Yeah, but that's not the secret|of the universe. - Isn't it?|- [ Mrs. Naumann ] Yes, thanks. "Miss Naumann,youngest district|spelling champion ever. " - You know that?|- Mm-mmm. Wow. Mimi? Mim, we"re all going to Sacramento|next month. [ Aaron ] We came here for|the science fair. Remember? Yeah. Come on. Let's take a picture.|Excuse me. Could you hold this? - Everybody.|- All right. - Smile.|- [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] - There you go.|- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

" I'm afraid that's incorrect,|but don't leave the stage. If number 26 misspells her word,|the bee will continue. If she spells it correctly,|she"ll be the winner. Number 26,your word is "batik. " - ''Batik''?|- "Batik. " ''Batik.''|[ Sighs ] - [ Applause ]|- [ Mr. Naumann ] Wow.! Yes! That's my girl! I can't believe it.|Oh, that's great! I brought you a glass of water. - Thanks.|- Here you go. Hmm. Is that my old suitcase? Dad gave it to me|for the state bee. [ Chuckles ]|I didn't know we still had it. My parents bought it for me|when I went to boarding school. Were you scared? At boarding school? Um- No. Uh- I was already about your age. There was nothing|to be scared of. - Why'd they send you?|- Hmm. That's what people did. Were you there... when they died? Uh... yeah. Um, yeah.|I was at school. Mm-hmm. This is for you, Elly. It was mine.|My mother gave it to me. - What is it?|- [ Gasps ] Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no.|Don't- Don't- It doesn't come apart.|It's a- It's a kaleidoscope. You look through it|and see things. Hold it towards the light. - Hmm?|- Like that, yeah. - Oh.|- Turn it. I used to carry it with me. Mmm. I loved the way|it holds the light. Do you see that? Elly? Um- When you're trying|to spell a word... what happens... to you? I mean, when|you close your eyes? I start out hearing it|in my head... in the voice|of whoever said it. Then the voice changes...|into something else. The word's voice. And then I can see it. - What?|- The word. I can see the word. - Mom?|- Go to sleep. Mmm.|[ Kisses ] Good night, Mom. What you did today|at the bee... it was, uh... remarkable. Good night. - [ Sighs ]|- [ Glass Cracking ] [ Eliza ] Were you there...|when they died? [ Mrs. Naumann ]|Were you there... when they died? [ Eliza ]|Were you scared? [ Muttering ] [ Singing ] [ Whispers ]|I'm tired. I'm tired. [ Sighs ] You know, Elly's never|had anything like this. [ Mrs. Naumann"s Voice ]|I used to carry it with me. [ Woman ]|Mimi? Mimi? On y va maintenant,|ma douce. [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Dog Barking In Distance ]|- [ Door Opens ] Hey, sweetheart. [ Sighs ] You look like you|could use a snack. I cut up some cheese or you can have|a cookie if you want, but... all that sugar,|you"ll probably crash later on. - Protein"s better.|- How come you're home? I came home|to be with you. Come on in. Come on. Come on in. You know, I thought this|could be our study area, right here. Now, we don't have|as much time as I'd like... but I think we can get through|a lot before the state bee... and then, hopefully... we'll have another chance|for the nationals. What do you think? You know, it'd be like|you were one of my students. [ Sighs ] I'm pretty good|at this kind of thing, you know. - [ Phone Ringing ]|- That's Mom. - Hi.|- Hi, honey. Are you okay? Dad's here. We're in his room. - Dad?|- He's gonna help me study. - [ Snaps Fingers ]|- He wants to talk to you. - I'll see you later.|- Okay. - Bye.|- Bye. - Okay. Hey.|- Hi. What"s going on? - I rearranged some office hours|so you don't have to rush home.|- Oh. - Anything wrong?|- No, I'm- I'm-I'm fine. I'm just-|[ Chuckles, Sighs ] - Uh, make sure-|- Mimi. - It's okay. We're having a good time.|- Okay. Okay. Bye. [ Mrs. Naumann"s Voice ] What happens|to you when you close your eyes? [ Eliza"s Voice ]|...when you close your eyes? [ Mrs. Naumann"s Voice ]|Do you see what I see? [ Birds Chirping ] [ Mrs. Naumann"s Voice ]|What happens to you, Elly... when you close your eyes? - Do you see what I see?|- [ Eliza"s Voice ]...what I see? [ Mrs. Naumann"s Voice ]|In the world. - In the light.|- [ Eliza"s Voice ]...light- [ Mrs. Naumann"s Voice ]|In everything around us. [ Sighs ] Here. - [ Door Opens ]|- Hey! [ Water Running, Shuts Off] - You all right?|- I'm fine. Yeah? I expected you hours ago.|Where you been? - [ Sighs ]|- [ Cello, Classical ] I was starting to worry.|Called your cell. You didn't answer. - Oh, I forgot to charge it.|- Oh, right. Uh, Phil asked me to coauthor|the Lancet paper. I guess he wants someone|to wash his petri dishes. I thought you|only washed my dishes. - [ Continues ]|- Hmm? - There's food here.|- Thanks. I got something. All right. Aaron? - Aaron!|- [ Stops ] Not so loud. Elly's studying. [ Metronome Clicking ] [ Water Running ] I want you to write|the letters. All right. I'm gonna start you off here now,|but you gotta keep your eyes closed, okay? - Take a deep breath.|- [ Breathes Deeply ] - [ Whispering ]|- And just say the letters to yourself. The whole thing,|backwards and forwards. - [ Continues ]|- Uh-huh. Relax. Just-Just concentrate|on the letters. - [ Murmuring ]|- Good. Good, keep going. [ Whispering ]|V-W-X-Y-Z-Y-X-W-V-U... T-S-R-QP-O-N-M-L-K- - [ Continues, Indistinct ]|- Open your mind to the letters, Elly. Concentrate. Put each one in your mind.|Let them flow through you... from your hand to the pad. [ Murmuring ] [ Continues ] Okay. You can stop. That was wonderful,|really wonderful. [ Chuckles ] I didn't do it. You know, it's not|what they look like... it's what they feel like. You were perfect. Okay, I'd like us to try something else now,|a little bit different. [ Sighs ] Now, I want you to close|your eyes, take a deep breath. [ Breathes Deeply ] And now I want you|to open your mind... to all the words in the universe|that contain the letter E. [ Holds Sound ]|E- E- - Two, uh, chocolate Kwik shakes.|- Okay. Really good. - [ Man ] Oh, great. Is this our champion?|- That's my girl. - Elly, this is John.|- Hi. [ Mr. Naumann ] I brought|you here, Elly, because I want us... to start thinking about|something beyondjust spelling... beyond letters and words. You know that|to become a professor... I had to write a thesis,|kind of a book. I wrote about|something very special. About kabbalah-|Jewish mysticism. And one of the most famous|of theJewish mystics... was a man called|Abraham Abulafia. What's a mystic? A mystic is a person... who believes that you can talk... really connect with God. Not just pray,|but have God listen... and sometimes, in special cases,|have God talk back. Aaron sings to God.|I've heard him. Yeah, well, we all can do things|in praise of God- write poetry, simply pray. But I'm talking about|something more... something that|almost no one can do... something beyond words. What? Let God flow through you. Abulafia believed that|by concentrating on letters... the mind could be opened up... and reach what|he called shefa. What? The most special way|of being together with God. Steps to getting there|are in these books. Exercises, words and letters. - [ Eliza ] Like what we"ve been doing.|- Yes, exactly. Let me show you. [ Mrs. Naumann ]|Elly? Mmm? Elly? Elly. Bad dream? I have a present for you. It was mine|when I was your age. But we'll pick something up|before you leave tomorrow, if it doesn't fit. Get dressed for|school now, okay? Thanks, Mom. [ Door Closes ] - Hey.|- Hey. Hey. What's up? - Uh, nothing.|- I'm late. Uh- - I was returning your Brodsky.|- Oh, God. I forgot about that. Yeah, could you put it on top|of my desk? I got to go. See you. - Okay. Bye.|- Bye. [ Door Closes ] [ Car Horn Honking ] [ Church Bells ] [ Man ]|Have mercy on us all. Make us worthy to share|eternal life with Mary- - Oh, sorry.|- [ Woman ] Excuse me. ...the apostles|and with all the saints... who have done your will|throughout the ages. May we praise you|in union with them... and give you glory through|your son,Jesus Christ. This is the Lamb of God who takes away|the sins of the world. And happy are those who have|been called to his supper. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Whispering ]|The body of Christ. Dad? Is God red? Red?|[ Chuckles ] No. [ Mr. Naumann ] The support about|which a lever pivots; "fulcrum. " [ Eliza ]|I"ve almost got it. F-U-L-C-R-U-M. Well done, Elly Belly.|Okay. "Puerile. " Maybe that's enough|spelling for now. Okay. Earth to Aaron.|Come in, Aaron. - What?|- So how about it? What do you think? - How about what?|- I asked you 1 0 minutes ago. You think you and Mom will survive|a few days while we're at the state finals? Yeah.|[ Exhales ] Sure. Whatever. Aaron? You didn't eat anything. - [ Dishes Clattering ]|- Thought he liked my cooking. [ Door Closes ] Okay, 7 1 3. This way. It's on this side. [ Mr. Naumann ]|Here it is. - [ Door Closes ]|- Wow, look at this. Adjoining rooms, pretty cool. Why don"t you pick one, honey? - Which one do you want?|- This one, I think. Take the other one.|It's got a better view. You'll like it better. You wanna practice a little? - Mm-hmm.|- Good. [ Ship"s Horn Blows ] [ Woman Whistling ]|Tiger? [ Whistle ] - Tiger.!|- Oh. Come here. Come on.|Sorry about her. - [ Laughs ]|- Don't worry about it. - So, are you?|- What? A Hindu. - Oh, no. No.|- Too many gods? Yeah, something like that. - I'm Chali.|- Aaron. - Nice to meet you.|- You, too. - School stuff?|- Uh, no.Just checking it out. Something's missing. - How do you mean?|- From your life. [ Chuckles ]|Yeah, I guess. I used to feel that way. I was raised a Catholic,|but it felt like empty ritual. [ Both Laughing ] Yeah, my mom was Catholic... and she, uh, converted|when she met my dad. We'reJewish. - Can I give you something to read?|- Yeah, sure. [ Fog Horn Blowing ] My number's on the back. - Oh, awesome.|- [ Laughs ] - It was nice to meet you, Aaron.|- Yeah, you too. Girl. Come on, you. - Bye, Cali.|- [ Chuckles ] Chali. Chali. That is correct. Except that you've omitted|the last and most important word. [ Channels Switching ] [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] 9:30. [ Inhales ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Line Ringing ] [ Alarm Chirps ] Uh-Y-You're not|riding with me? No, I've got some stuff|to do after school. - You-You sure?|- Yeah.

A cotyledon is the primary|or embryonic leaf... or leaves of a seedling. What is the derivation,|please? "Cotyledon"comes to us|from the Greek. C-O...

This notebook is my translation|of Abulafia"s words. It"s his guide, Elly,|for reaching shefa. "Cleanse your heart and soul. ''Permute the letters|back and forth. "This will arouse in you many words,|one after the other. "You will feel then as if|an additional spirit is within you. "You will experience|ecstasy and trembling. ''In this manner,|you will reach beyond yourself. ''Go slowly,|as the path is dangerous... and must be traveled|with caution. " - I'd like us to try this.|- What? A permutation. Other people... have tried to do these,|but almost no one has felt... that special feeling|that he wrote about. I haven't been able|to do it. I tried. It was very important|to me, but... I couldn't. But I think maybe you can. I think you have|what Abulafia had. I saw it on the stage|at the bee. I think you can use|his methods to achieve shefa... to reach the ear of God. Let me show you|what I mean. Let's permute|the word ''Earth.'' What's inside|this word? ''Earth.'' ''Heart.'' ''Rathe.'' - Like in Boggle.|- Yeah, like that. Except the combinations don't|have to mean anything in the usual sense. Try another one.|You do it. Uh, ''library.'' [ Saul"s Voice ]|Make yourself right. Cleanse your heart and soul.|Permute the letters back and forth. [ Eliza"s Voice ]|Permute the letters back and forth. - You will feel then-|- You will feel then- - ...as if an additional spirit-|- ...as if an additional spirit is within you. - In this manner you will-|- In this manner you will reach beyond yourself.
