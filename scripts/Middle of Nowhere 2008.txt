Rollin', rollin', rollin' Hyah! Hyah! Rawhide! Hyah! Well, look's good down here. We'll ride into Endicott in the morning. Good, I thought we were gonna ride all the night the way you were going. If you want to unsettle, I'll scare up a fire. I don't want to admit to hearing what I think I hear. You seeing what I'm seeing? Yeah. Just what, besides girls, are those? Ballet dancers. Well, I seen ballet dancers at the Turkish Delight Saloon in San Antone... Ballet, not belly. I seen longer skirts and shorter legs. It's a big thing in Europe. Very popular. I have a hunch it's gonna be very popular in Texas too. Uh-huh. Come sit, master, please. Please. Your indulgence. You cannot see properly from here. Will you please follow me? You... You weren't here from the beginning, were you? Uh, no. Well, uh, I cannot permit that. A ballet must always be seen from the beginning. Oh, I'm sorry, we didn't know one was being performed out here. Oh. I'm MacKay. Gil Favor, this is Rowdy Yates, my ramrod. Ramrod? What's that? That means second in command. I'm trail boss of a herd that's coming through this way. Are you, indeed? Oh, I'm impressed. Won't you sit down? It's wine. French wine. The only thing to drink when you're seeing a beautiful ballet performance. Say, Mr. MacKay? Yes, lad. This is strange place to be holding a ballet. Ah, nonsense. There are times when MacKay has to go to Europe to get a ballet. There are other times when the ballet has to be brought to MacKay. Maestro. S, seor. And now you see a ballet as it should be seen. From the beginning, please. Bravo! Bravo, maestro. It was wonderful. Bravo! Bravo. Wonderful, wonderful. Gracia, gracia, Seor MacKay. And now, the 20 ounces of gold dust, as promised. Am I correct? You are very generous, seor. Me mountains are very generous to me. Ladies, you were marvelous. You were a delight to the eye and the heart and I'd like to give you a little present. Here. There's one for you. One for you. What's he giving them, rocks? I'll give you nice long odds those are nuggets. One for you. Gold? Being carried around like that? W-Where would he get it? I heard him say those mountains of his have been very generous to him. And here's one for you. Now, run along. Younger men are waiting all over the world. You mustn't keep them waiting. Oh, uh, Mr. MacKay. Oh, yes, uh, you don't have to thank me for the performance. I was happy to share me pleasure with you. Um... Trail boss, you say? That's right. Where's your herd? About five, six hours' ride south of here. Why aren't you with it? Well, we have to ride into Endicott in the morning. Endicott? Hm. I know the town. It's a dusty eyesore on the bosom of the prairie. Keep away from it. There isn't a girl to found within its dusty confines. Well, we may not have to go there now that we've run into you. We just wanted to get some information there about the Dead Mountains. What would you be seeking in the Dead Mountains? Water and a pass for the cattle. Plains are dry as a bone. Maybe you could tell us about it. Uh, you said you owned the mountain. I do. What is it you want to know? Is there a way for the cattle to get through? There is, indeed. And water? Enough to flourish a desert. Well, that's good news. Could you let us know the best way in? I'll take you there myself. Goodbye, Mr. MacKay. Au revoir. Bless them. Where are your horses? Oh, we got them right across the knoll there. We were gonna make night camp. Eh, make camp. Go on and get your horses and meet me here. Fine. Funny old jasper, isn't he? Yeah. It was a lucky break running onto him like that. Seems like a real old desert rat, the way he's dressed. Having them burrows and all. Well, the way he's throwing that gold around, he's more than found what he was looking for. He must have taken off as soon as we turned our backs. Yeah, but he was gonna take us into the mountains. Yeah, except that must be the one thing in the world he's most afraid of. But why? We ain't after any gold. He don't know that. Well, what do we do now? Well, wait till sunrise, ride up to those Dead Mountains, see if we can find a pass ourselves. There's a way in. Wide enough for the herd to get through. The ground don't look too bad. Well, so far so good. Of course, we haven't gone far yet. Yeah. Hold it. We ought to try making a run for it, huh? Well, this child ain't about to try and outrun bullets. No one in these mountains except the people in them. Raise your hands. Get off the horses. Where's he going? For help? They don't need any more help as far as I'm concerned. Why do you come to Dead Mountains? We look for water and a pass for our cattle. There is a pass. There is water. But they are both sacred to the Indians. You have come this far. No farther. We've got 3,000 head of cattle. They have to have water. Now, if your people need cattle, maybe we could trade. No white man comes to Dead Mountains. You're letting him go into the canyon. Mr. MacKay! Hey, MacKay! He mustn't hear you. He's a white man, you're letting him go in the canyon. No white man rides the Dead Mountains. What are you talking about? He's riding right in there. I see no one. Must be joking or something. You're free to go back where you came from. What about our guns and horses? Look, we don't want to break any of your tribal customs. Maybe it's only this pass that's sacred. This pass and all passes. Well, maybe it's only this part of the range. Every mountain in this range. Every rock, every tree, every blade of grass is sacred to us and to our ancestors. You know, I might believe that if it wouldn't... Ah, never mind. We wish you no harm. No blood has been drawn. But do not return, because if you do, there will be harm and blood will be drawn. What'll it be, gents? Whiskey or whiskey? Whiskey. You got a nice little town here. Endicott? You ain't had a real good look at it. Yeah, most stores did seem to be shut up. Permanent. Mister, Endicott ain't no town. It's just the leftovers. Well, you're in business. Ah. I'm just too lazy to move anyplace else. Besides, there was a time when Endicott was pretty flourishing. Lots of people had high hopes. What happened to it? Hopes need nourishing. Only reason old man Endicott started the town was he was sure there was gold in the Dead Mountains. Ain't there? Lots of men went into the mountains looking for it. Only one of them ever come back. Old man MacKay. Ever hear of him? Yeah, we heard of him. Every day, every week. Gunmen, fortune hunters come trailing into town all looking for old man MacKay's gold. All of them packing guns, willing and anxious to use them. Uh, what's your interest in the Dead Mountains? You looking for gold too? No, not gold. Water. We got 3,000 head of cattle on the Sedalia Trail. Why would you want to take cattle into them mountains? Well, there ain't any water on the plains for 30 miles, that's why. Hm. If I was moving 3,000 head of cattle, I sure wouldn't wanna take them into country I didn't know nothing about. That's why we're in Endicott, for some information about them. Information won't do you no good. What you need's a guide. You need somebody that knows them mountains as well he knows his way from that front door over at this bar. Got anybody in mind? Yes, I have. How'd you like to earn some money? No. Now, look, you're running short of money and I'm running short of whiskey. Oh? First I heard of that. My customers don't pay what they owe me, I can't afford to buy any new stuff. I think you ought to do what I say. Come on. This here is, uh, Joel Turner. Howdy. Gil Favor and Rowdy Yates. I was born and raised in this part of Texas, I could take you blindfold. Any nook or corner. Could you get 3,000 head of cattle through the Dead Mountains? Sure. What about Indians? There are not many of them in the hills. They stopped us. Oh? Where'd you come up from? South. They must have tried Echo Pass. There are lots of others. Much better suited for driving cattle through. Fine. The job's yours for the asking. I'm your man. Good. You ready to start out? As soon as I get my gear. We'll be right here. Excuse me. Are you going into the Dead Mountains? We sure are, ma'am... Uh, that's right, miss. My name is Barbara Fraser and I came to Endicott yesterday on the stage. How do you do, ma'am? Gil Favor, Rowdy Yates. How do you do? Please take me with you. Now, I know that sounds strange, but my father's in there somewhere and I've got to find him. We're taking a herd of cattle through. We wouldn't have time to be looking for anyone. But I just want to go along with you. I won't be any bother, really. I've hired a horse. And once we're in the mountains you wouldn't have to worry about me. I'd like to help you, miss, but, uh, there's just no place for you on a cattle drive. Oh, but I came all the way from the east and I'll just do anything to find him. Well, boss, maybe we could go... Uh, no, I'm afraid there's not a thing we could do for you, ma'am. I'm sorry, Miss Fraser. Yeah, I'm sorry too. Look, boss, I ain't one to argue, but... Then why are you going to? Well, you heard what she said. She's just looking for her long lost father. That's her story. Huh? You know, Rowdy, I'm beginning to believe half the population in these United States are trying to find a way into the Dead Mountains to find MacKay's gold. Oh, but that isn't the case with her. I mean, she just here after her father. You heard her say that. Like I said, that's her story. Oh. Well, l... I don't know how you can displease such a sweet-looking little girl as that. Oh. Practice. Well, I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long. The important thing is you're getting us where we want to go. I'll show you a way to get your herd through the mountains. Whoa. Whoa. That's the pass I had in mind. Ah, good. More than wide enough for the cattle. It don't stay that wide all the way in. The going gets pretty rough for quite a while before we get to water. It seems like it always does. Up here! Up here. That's that eastern girl, isn't it? Yeah. Pick up her horse. What happened? My horse stumbled. I fell. Trying to ride straight up the side of a mountain isn't the smartest thing in the world to do. I didn't think it would be. What'd you have in mind? Going into those mountains alone? I am going into these mountains. My father's in there and I'm gonna find him. Say, your father's name wouldn't be MacKay by any chance, would it? MacKay? Of course not. It's Fraser. Look, we're... We're going on in there. You know, we can't let her just go on by herself. Why can't we take her with us? Thank you. Well, looks like my mind's been made up for me. Oh, but boss... Look. If I had a choice, I'd send you back to Endicott right now. With him. You think you can manage to sit your horse? Well, she's riding with them, we're riding after them. Plan's working out, Banning. Yeah, just like you planned it. Yeah, well, let's go. We wouldn't want them to get lost. You know, traveling hasn't been too bad so far. We're past the worst part of it. I think we ought to be able to get our herd through here, don't you? Yeah, sure, I guess so. Well, come morning, Mr. Favor, we got three or four more hours' ride before we get to water. Well, fine. Oh! Oh...! Oh! Oh. I suppose I behave foolishly. It was probably just a coyote or something. No, that was "just" a mountain lion. You know, for somebody who scares easy, you sure get in some strange places. Oh, l... I just felt like being alone. Felt like remembering my father. The way he was the last time I saw him. He was very tall. Almost as tall as you are. And very gentle. He was educated in Edinburgh and was teaching in Boston. He was a geologist and a mining engineer. Everyone said he had a brilliant career ahead of him. And what happened to him? Well, he took me on an excursion one day. Left my mother alone in the cabin. And the lamp overturned and the cabin burned down. He started drinking very heavily after her death. I guess he felt guilty about leaving her alone. And then he gave up his teaching job and sent me to live with an aunt and uncle. And then he just disappeared. He went west. There were a few letters at first, but then none at all. What makes you think he's in Texas? Well, I got a letter from him two months ago. You mean, he told you to come out here alone like this? Oh, no. He just wanted to know if I was happy and if everything was all right. But in it he mentioned the Dead Mountains. And I found out where they are, and here I am. Did, uh, he say what he was doing in the Dead Mountains? Well, he said that a man who had befriended him was using his training and knowledge. Sounds like it could be MacKay. He didn't say. He could use his experience as a geologist to help him find the ore, and as a mining engineer to help him get it out. Mr. Favor, you've just got to help me find him. Look, l... I've got to get a herd through. You took me with you. And you didn't have to. Yeah, I know. Are you sorry for me? Let's say I made a mistake. Why are you so afraid of being human? The only thing I'm afraid of is not getting the job done that I'm paid to do. Perhaps I could pay you too. I've already been hired. So I guess we better get back to camp. It was a wild and turbulent crossing. And the waves of the Atlantic Ocean were rising mountains high while our little ship was being tossed about like a... Like a leaf on a waterfall. But did MacKay get scared? Did MacKay tremble? He most certainly did. And after riding many miles in an iron horse, here I am. Home at last. And now I'm going to tell you something you really want to know. On my way back here, I stopped in at your village. And you'll be glad to learn everything is going along fine. I've had some plows shipped out from the east. They put 200 more acres onto cultivation. It'll be about a week before your replacements come in. And then you can go back to your village. Mr. MacKay. Yes, lad? When you were in our village, did you see my wife? Ah. I did, indeed. What's more, I saw your son. A son. I am glad. Ah. Of course you are. You want to laugh and dance and sing, don't you? You've a right to. He's a beautiful baby. There are white men camping in mountains tonight. But I was not followed in. No one's ever been able to do that. It is the two drovers, and others. Another man and woman. Also two riders who remain apart. I don't like the sound of it. We'll have to do something about it, lads, won't we? Come on, Banning, we haven't got all day. We should be ready to move out the instant they do. Don't worry, we'll be ready. Ready for what? You men are a long ways from Endicott, aren't you? So are you. There ain't a bar in sight. I'm not leading you to MacKay's gold. Of course you ain't. You're just showing that trail boss a pass through the mountains. That's right. So why worry about us? I'm not worried about you. I've got my story all ready. I found you following me. You tried to jump me. And I had to kill the pair of you. I don't think that's a very good idea. Do you, Jim? I sure don't. That's too bad. Turner? You got a gun? In my saddlebag. Get it. I'll go on ahead. You cover me. Well, what if they're Indians? I don't know what it is yet. Might be just Turner getting breakfast. Somebody was a pretty good shot. Three holes, not an inch apart. Whoever it was couldn't have gone very far. Well, they might as well be on the other side of the moon. It'll only take them a few seconds to disappear in this. Yeah, this'll only take a few seconds for someone to get lost, you mean. It just doesn't seem real. Oh, it's real enough, all right. What do we do now? We get out of these mountains as fast as we can, if we can. Backtracking on this rocky ground ain't gonna be no joy. Sun might be some help if we knew which way Turner took us. But we don't. Well, sitting around ain't gonna change things. Let's go. No, another dead end. We're not getting anyplace, boss. All that means is we keep on trying. Come on, mount up. What do you mean, "Keep on trying"? We can do that forever. Oh, no. I forgot. We don't have any more water. How long is it before you die of thirst? You're not gonna die of thirst. Well, what am I gonna die of? Look, we got in here. So there must be a way out. We'll find it. Same way those other people did? The ones who came in here and never came out? Now, look, I don't know or care about them. Well, I do. I know what happened. The same thing that's gonna happen to us. They just kept going round and round the way we've been doing. And every rock looked like every other rock, and they kept saying they'd find a way out and they never did. Hey, boss. One thing's sure, he'll know a way out of here. What good will that do us? It'll do us a lot of good if we can keep him in sight. Come on, mount up. Suppose he tries to lead us into a trap? He don't have to. We're already in one. Easy, Jim. There ain't any more where that come from. All that did was make me thirsty. I'm getting sick of these rocks. Maybe you better start to love them. They're likely to be the last thing you'll ever see. If only we hadn't lost them drovers. They're likely in the same spot as we are. Well, what are we supposed to do? Stand right here and die? It's been done. Tyree. What's he hanging around for? What are you whispering for? He can't hear you. I don't want him to go away. Well, why? That ain't... I got me an Indian. Now, that makes my day... That ain't smart. That's all I was gonna say. I have done as you said. Fine. And now let's take a look at what flows down to us from the benevolent mountain, huh? You know, at first sight a foolish man might think this was pebble. Ha! But we know better, don't we, my lad? And there's no end to the gold in mountains. At least not yet. We're out of the rocks. We still keep following him? Yeah. He could've led us deeper into them if he'd wanted to. Maybe he's found a quicker way to get rid of us. Yeah. Let's keep following him. That could be a mistake, boss. Yeah, but what's one more? Yeah. Guaranteed there's a madness in each and every one of you. You came up here to seek for gold. We came up here looking for water and for grazing land. There's plenty of water and grazing land in the mountains. But not in the direction you were going. We hired a guide. Where is he? He was killed by your people. You're wrong. He was killed by that man and his partner. But he deserved it. He was not leading you to green pastures. We hired him in good faith. Faith, means, um... It's a matter of belief, is it not? Why should I believe you? Either you do or you don't. That's a matter of faith for you to decide. You wouldn't be the first to come up to these mountains and never be heard of again. Our drovers will be up looking for us. No chance would they have of finding this place. What do you think we're so interested in your gold for? We got 3,000 head of cattle on our hands. Well, I've heard you say that, but I've never seen it. And this girl. Why is she with you? Looking for her father. Oh. What's your name? Barbara Fraser. Was your father one of the men that came up to look for MacKay's gold? Story she told us, he's a geologist and a mining engineer. His wife died, he drank up everything back east, so he came west. Last place he was heard from was the Dead Mountains. And who did the hearing? She got a letter from him. A letter? Interesting. Where did your father get his education? Edinburgh. Oh, the girl's clever. She knows everything about the man she's talking of. Everything except one thing. And what's that? He didn't have a daughter. He's lying. Mr. Favor, I sincerely beg your pardon. I very much doubt you being a murderer, but I'm afraid you've been misled by a pair of pretty eyes. Among other things. You see, I'm the man she's talking about. Careful. Now, get down there. All of you. There are other braves about, you know. They'll be back. You two get down here. Down here. Tyree. Is this what we came out here for? If we're lucky there'll be enough to get us back east. That ain't all the gold there is. You said there was more than a man could carry. There is! He's got it stashed someplace. Now, where do you keep the gold? We don't keep it. We spend it. You saw me kill once, and I'll kill again. I don't mind killing. Matter of fact, you might say I like it. Now, gold never did a dead man any good. So why don't you tell us where you've hidden it? And you might live to mine more. Well, uh, I'm a reasonable man and there's a good deal of sense in what you say. But we have no thieves in the hill. We manage to keep them out. Usually. So all we have to do with the gold is throw it onto the sluices. Maybe he's lying. Yeah. You go down and get the gold. As you wish. I suppose you want all the gold there is. That's right. All of it. Say, MacKay. Yes? Uh, you'll be needing a hand, won't you? Aye. The gold's awful heavy. Come along. He's much better-looking when he's unconscious, isn't he? Thank you, young man. You'd better take him in to that sheriff in Endicott. I think you better take her too. I don't think they'll hang her like they will him. But it'll be some time before she gets out to look for her father that never was. And the gold that was never hers. We'll take her in. And when you return, my Indians will show you the finest pass through the mountains. And the finest grazing lands. Don't worry, heh, it won't be anywhere near this place. Isn't this the doggonest thing you ever seen, Joe? No trail drive should ought to be without one. This kind of thing go on all the time? No, but it ought to. I suspected your men would enjoy a cancan more than a ballet, Mr. Favor. Huh? Oh, they... They appreciate it, all right, all right. Say, uh, one thing bothers me, Mr. MacKay. What might that be? Well, these stories about men going into the Dead Mountains and disappearing forever, there must be some truth to them. Yes, it's possible some of them got lost. Others may have died of thirst or starvation. While others... My Indians are very loyal, Mr. Favor. Head 'em up! Move 'em out! Rollin', rollin', rollin' Rollin', rollin' Rollin' Keep rollin', rollin' Rollin' Though the streams Are swollen Keep them dogies rollin' Rawhide! Through rain and wind And weather Hell-bent for leather Wishin' my gal Was by my side All the things I'm missin' Good vittles Love and kissin' Are waiting at the end Of my ride Move 'em on, head 'em up Head 'em up, move 'em on Move 'em on, head 'em up Rawhide Let 'em out, ride 'em in Ride 'em in, let 'em out Cut 'em out Ride 'em in Rawhide! Rollin', rollin', rollin' Hyah! Hyah! Rawhide! Hyah! Hyah! Rollin', rollin', rollin'
