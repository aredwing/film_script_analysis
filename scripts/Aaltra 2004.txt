Good kitty. Too bad you weren't at the meeting. But I'm fine without you, As always. Excuse me for two seconds. How far are you? - He had to go. Won't be long. He had to go? - He won't be long. This game's been going on for two months. He's always absent. He's messing with us. Him working from home. Are you crazy? I'll get on this file. It's illegal to dump chemicals this close to an urban area. Besides, my wife's pregnant. - Call his mobile. Well, the company's. That stuff's everywhere. Mr. Vives? - Yes, hello? Mr. Senac's here for you. Vives? - Hello Mr. Senac. Don't you live half an hour from Paris by TGV? Sorry, my reception is bad, I'm in a tunnel. Meet me in my office in half and hour or you're sacked. I'll be right there. - I've had enough. What are you doing... Fuck! I'd like an other room. - Let's see. It's not bad here. They've come to get your tractor. Did you pay your installments? When you lend money... That is alright, But you have to pay it all back. But not you. All you do is sleep and hang around. Here? - Nothing. Here? - Nothing. He's everyone's favorite to win Namur. Everyone is doing incredibly well. Five more Grand Prix to go and now is an important time because I'm now ahead of Michael. But I have be on the offense. Namur is next and it's one of my favorite tracks. You should do this on your own now. Your roommate can. The Siamese are leaving. It's not getting any better. Gentlemen, Good news. We'll let you go. Don't give up hope. Never ever. Science progresses each day. What doesnt kill you I better go. I'm tired. I'm like a ball from a pinball machine... I'm rolling and rolling. I'm like a ball from a pinball machine... I'm rolling and rolling. Christ, it's hot. Don't you have AC in your truck? Only in my dreams. My brother-in-law has a tractor... with an AC. But me? No way. Don't you have one? But it's a waste of gas. You're right. I have a car. I had the choice of ABS or AC. And I picked safety. AC... no, ABS. I'm still thinking in Francs. But AC... Would've been good. Maybe next time. It's so hot. I drove my brother-in-law's tractor the other day. Put the AC on 20. From dawn to dusk. Rolling on. I loved it. Couldn't tell what time it was. Are you too hot? turn it down. When it's 24 outside you'll catch a cold when you get out. It's a choice you have to make. But it's a waste of gas. Your mileage... One liter. Diesel. Yes. And in 10 to 15 years AC will be standard. No more choices. AC for everyone. Really. I'm sure. Isabelle? Isabelle? Isabelle? Right next to your colleague. What are you doing here? This pen doesn't work. Crap. Helsinki... Are you two together? - No. Where are you going? - Namur. I'll make a reservation, But disabled persons must make their reservation to make the arrangements. Alright. Passport please - Yes. Here. - Thank you. His passport. Thank you. We've made reservations for two yesterday. One for Helsinki and one for... Namur.

Hold the beans like this Then cut them into three or four pieces. Fearless and brave, my boy. Just like Albert Libertad, who during the Belle Epoque... was a disabled rebel. He started a riot anywhere. With his crutches... he stormed any political meeting. He got up on stage Sat himself down and used his crutches to break the legs... of anyone trying to remove him.. He made deserters out of soldiers. He sang out in the streets and in the shops. "Stop all useless activity!" He burned any passport he got his hands on. He stormed churches While in service... and called the priest a bastard. And all the visitors dumb sheep. He destroyed cemeteries, rebelled against fear of dying, and the cadaver cult. He mocked the middle class... by living with the nuns. Long live Albert Libertad. Sir? Biker solidarity. - No. Can you spare 3, 4 Euros? - I don't have 50. Sir, can I ask you something?

I'm here for my shot. I had a blood clot. Understand? Aunt Roberte... she's doing fine. She's doing fine... Sorry, she's dead. She actually died. But aunt Olga on the other hand is doing marvelous. What? Aunt Louqui, it's aunt Louqui. And? She's my niece Micheline's mother. All I know about it is what happened in Congo. Greetings... Bwana, bwana. You know? I felt as if... - Watch out. A bit like the pope in his popemobile. Get it? I looked like an idiot. I remember the first time you peed. I remember exactly how you... found out how to pee. It was incredible. Straight on. And.. What was I saying? The amazing thing was... the fact that... they lived in small villages in the forest... and what did they do? Take a right. Take a right. - Be careful. When I came to the village all children would be waiting. Bwana, bwana! Like the pope in his popemobile. Really, amazing. And I stood there like an idiot. Then what happened... Oh yeah, I realized... - Turn right. When they saw us like that... Careful. It's OK. When they saw us like that... coming from the horizon... What did they think? Well, that we came down from heaven. But god dammit... This is really far. You said... I need my shot. Straight on just a bit more. - Straight on. Straight, then turn right. - Nearly there. Yes, great. OK. Because, you know... All these memories... Incredible, the amount of memories. It's great in a way. Come on! Go! Very good. Jrmie, you know why black people can't do this? Because when they jump, they get stuck in a tree. Give us a kiss. A kiss. Yeah, that's motorcross. Where's Pichon? - Over there. Hey, who was first? Everts. And who's Everts? Seven times a world champion. Image, Jrmie. Seventy times. Plus all his dad's victories makes ninety times. Together they were world champions ninety times. No sir, you're wrong. What? - You're wrong. Why? - Don't believe everything your dad says. Everts has only been a world champion six times, Plus his dad's two times. Makes eight. What did I say? - Ninety. Ninety times a world champion. There's something like motorcross history. Listen, Superman. Just because you lost your legs doesn't mean you can be rude with me. Dad, come on. - It's OK, Jrmie. Yes. You're lucky I'm here with my son. Know what, Jrmie, let's go get some snacks. We can get snacks easily whenever we want. Get a snack and back, get a snack and back. As often as we like. Feel like running, Jrmie? Oh, I love my legs. Bastard. Guys, you can't sit here. Keep clear. Let's go. Who's he? That's Joel Robert. Joel Robert. And? - Great. And my sandwich? - I have something better. Look. Testdriving the Husqvarna automatic. The only one in motocross history. You don't need a license to ride it. You and your bikes. Fuck it, I'm fed up. Don't you understand you'll never ride? You told me it's all over! Finished! Your dreams, your champions. That Joel Robert kicked you around like a piece of shit. Joel Robert would never say that. Do you know who Joel Robert is? - No. He was the world champion motorcross six times. Between 1962 and 1972. He's allowed to treat me like shit. I am shit next to him, so are you, so is everyone. Even worse: we're dead. - You're dead. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm hungry and cold and want to smash everything. What's your problem? Hitting a handicapped guy! I don't want to hit you. I want to go to Finland. Fuck off! - Piss off to Finland! Hey, there's another one! We can't leave him here. - Please, it's our holidays. Why not? - Honey, I'm not Mother Teresa. Let someone else give him a lift. - But we can't leave him there. Honey, you don't know what he's like, he could be a criminal. A criminal? Don't make me laugh. - We've already lost half an hour No, no, keep driving. Such friendly people. Where did you get that? The fridge of those friendly people. I've had enough of it. They drank all our liquor. They are drunk as a fiddler. They ate all our food. Are you bringing them home too? - But they're handicapped. I don't want to hear another word about it. Let's go. Our father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come... on earth as it is in heaven... What were the words again? I think it's fading. Bastard! Listen to this. Hakan Carlqvist, World Champion of 1988. It's about Namur, where we've been. Namur is excellent for pranks. At one point the road passes a bar, called Le Chalet du Monument. Often did I envy the spectators... sitting in the shade, while we were nearly melting on our bikes. Before the game I told my brother to order me a beer in that bar. If I had the time I would drink the beer in a later round. And I did. I came out with a beer moustache. Wonderful. Those were the days. Can you imagine Michael Schumacher pulling over for a beer? Cut it... the sausage. What's that? Finland. Me, to Finland. I didnt have my accident there but I want to go to Finland. No sauce? - No sauce. None? It's OK. Now you can buy the Husqvarna bike... and win every Grand Prix. Come on. Fuckers. Do you think we're retarded? Here we come. Which of you assholes built my trailer? They can't hear you with their helmets on. Give us back our legs! Give us back our legs you fuckers! Did you build my trailer? Sure, just pretend you're working. Swindler. Do you think handicapped people are funny? You'll pay. Pay up! You have to pay me! I brought my medical file. We lost our legs because of your lousy trailer. Because of your crap! We want to be reimbursed. - 6 million Euros by my count. - For each of us. Look at this, Aaltra material. I didn't travel 3000 kilometers to not speak to the boss. Bring me the manager. Manager! I have been ran over with one of your tractors! Do you understand? Are you listening? The manager! I want to speak to him, you hear? Reimbursement! Six million! Six million Euros! Who's in charge of writing the manuals here? Anybody? No interpreter? I want my money! Reimbursement! Six million! - Do you understand? I want to see the manager right now! You're just nattering away on that phone! We lost our legs! How do you feel about that? At the other end of town. Six million. You seem to know my gear well. Would you like to work for me? Yeah, why not. Tomorrow. Tomorrow morning at seven. - Seven it is. Eight. - Eight 'o clock. Eight. Does it rain here often? Only on Sundays. - Only on Sundays? But it's Monday today.
