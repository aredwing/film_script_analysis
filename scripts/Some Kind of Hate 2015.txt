You plugged all this wires and shit into it. Now there's no picture. You fucking drunk. - What did you say to me? - You heard me. What did you say to me? Say it again! Say it again! You're a big tough guy, now? Say it. I'll fix it when I get back. Yeah, you'll fix it. Too scared to eat in the cafeteria with everybody else? I'm not scared. Then why are you out here doodling like a little girl? What did I ever do to you? You came to this school and acted like a fag, you fucking freak. Get outta my way. Oh, man, you came all over yourself! Is it because you're so excited to see me, fag tag? You gonna clean up that mess? Are you crying? What do they say? No crying over spilled milk? Come on, fag tag, lick it up. You getting this? Leave me alone! I'll fucking kill you! Here you go. 50 bucks for each criminal mastermind. Oh, come on. They're not bad kids, they're just a little lost. - Now they're found. - Well, they will be, once they meet him. - You don't get out too much, do you, Krauss? - Mister Iverson needs me here. At the school. Bye now, have a blessed day! For those of you joining our program this semester, welcome. I designed Mind's Eye Academy as a place to reset. A place to learn how to do things differently. We attune ourselves to the desert. To the Earth, and to the sky. Giving your cell phones to Christine frees you up to other communications. We work with our hands... as well as our minds. There's no service here, anyways. - It's got all my music. - No exceptions. But if you think of it as part of a larger process, then it just might. You've come here to destroy the impulses that got you here. I've seen worse. The place is a fucking scam. Yeah, see that Mercedes in the lot? We could hotwire it, take it to Vegas. Yeah, why not? They can pin some more bullshit crimes on us, right? Okay, hold on. My crime was not bullshit, all right? - Porn hack. - What? I... rerouted my school servers to Bangtastic.com. I'm sure you know it. You know, everyone googling Selena Gomez, or Bieber, or whoever the fuck, you know. Bang! Big cocks. Wide open pussies. How much of a hero are you? I was number one thug for about a day. So what about you? Come on, man, we're all fuckups here. This kid was picking on me for years. I finally hit him back. They blamed it on me. Fucking bullies always get away with their shit. I wanna live in a world where... where assholes get what they deserve, you know? Well, you must have clocked the shit outta that dude. Come on, man. It ain't so bad. We're surrounded by beautiful sunsets and emotionally annihilated girls. Yeah, I could get into sitting on the porch with a shotgun, dropping acid. Firing at invisible machine elves. Jesus, no means no, guy. Eating alone? No. - I heard about you. - Is that a good thing? Pretty good. - What was that about? - Oh, he's just asking about you. - What's with all the attention? - Come on, you like it. Nice. - Seriously, what was that about? - I don't know, forget about it. Samantha. Tell us why you're here. Because my parents are fucking retarded. - Let's not blame others. - Because I was selling pills. I wanted to be captain of the soccer team, my parents expected straight As. But with Adderall I could do everything. - So what's the problem? - Kaitlin... Your mind is everything, what you think, you become. Do not dwell on the past, do not dream of the future. Concentrate the mind on the present moment. Hey. - She makes me desperate for a cigarette. - Have you seen our teacher? And try to run the down and up. And back into downward dog. The desire to be perfect? The trick of the ego. Screw that. Everybody wants to be perfect. He's not saying everyone doesn't wanna be perfect, he's just saying that wanting doesn't get you very far. Very helpful, Willie, thank you. May seem crazy to you guys. Trust me, it did to me, too when I used to go here. Keep your spine aligned. - Lincoln? - What? Would you like to tell us why you're here? No. I don't deserve to be here. Let's go, man. I'm good. I thought you were pretty badass. I mean, stabbing somebody in the face with a fork? That's pretty gangster. He got what he deserved. Yeah, well, we don't need to pull vigilante shit here, right? I'm cool with that. You're cool with that? Fucking cool with that? Isn't that fucking groovy? It's because of you, isn't it? You're going around telling people that I'm some freak that stabbed someone with a fork. No, I'm not. At least have the balls to admit it, Isaac. - All right, man, but it's badass. - No, it's not. Because now people are gonna test me to see if I lose my shit. No. They'll think you're a stone cold killer and leave you the fuck alone. Not how it works, Isaac. Jesus, all right, I'm just trying to help. Why don't you fucking stick up for yourself? What we've got here is a failure to communicate. Look, I'm just fucking with you. I mean, seriously, how clich is this? The bully picking on the spazzy kid, trying to get him to freak out? Glad you came around. I just wanna skip to the part where you freak out. Oops. Guess I'm the spazz. Nasty. You actually talk? I thought you'd just have him do it for you. Pick it up. No. Pick it the fuck up. Good job, shitheads. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Nice lighter. Thanks. It was my mom's. I think it's cool, you know. What you did to that kid to get sent here. I feel bad. People get what they deserve. Or they should. I hate bullies. - What'd you do to get here? - Usual bad girl stuff. The wayward cheerleader. - You're a cheerleader? - Past life. I think it's starting to happen again... with Willie. I don't wanna fight him. But he keeps testing me. I can help. What are you gonna do? I'll kick his ass. You'll get us both killed. Here's hoping. - Wait, do it again. - Do it again. Do it again. Just say that. Don't fuck up. Yeah. - "Tippin' on my dick"? - That shit... I'm in the party with my jeans to a sag If a girl wanna dance then she gotta be bad Tippin' on my dick Tip, tippin' on my dick I like any song that's about anybody licking my clit. This is a good song. I'm tasty, yeah, I'm a cold ass bitch I gotta be specifically in this piece of shit So fuck you literally and come and get my shit - Oh, shit. - What happens next? Oh, shit. What's this? Fuck you, Iverson. - You scared the shit out of me. - I'm sorry. Walls are super thin. What are they gonna do? Put us in a reform school in the middle of the desert? Or else they'll meditate us to death. I brought you something. I made a playlist for you. Where'd you hide this? I found where they stashed them, and I took it back. - Fuck them, it's mine. - Awesome. Thanks. I know you're a cheerleader, or whatever. Maybe you won't like this music, but... That's awesome. It saved me so many times. Have you ever had the feeling, when your whole body's saying... you wanna punch your head through the wall? This... makes me feel like I'm driving a tank and... rolling over piles of skulls and blasting mortar shells through everybody that pissed me off. I mean, you go through this whole experience of anger and fighting and hatred. And when the song's over, I don't feel like putting my head through a wall. For just that one minute. I know exactly that feeling. Do... You need to fight him. What? Willie. If you don't take him down early, he will eat you alive. Kaitlin, this is the exact reason why I'm here. Do it in front of his friends. He won't squeal. Hit him once and he'll crumble. Show him that skull-crushing tank, and he'll find somebody else to fuck with. I don't think that's a good idea. Don't think, Lincoln. I should... I should get back to my room. - Where you going, man? - I'm afraid I forgot... You look like take a shower. Don't let me stop you. It's okay. Clean yourself off for that hot snatch of yours. - She does like it dirty, trust me, I know. - She figure out you're a faggot? You guys are pathetic. - Get the fuck off me! - Always the hard way with you. - I'll fucking kill you! - What, a little spanking? - This is messed up, man, let's forget it. - Shut up. She's gonna love this. You hit me. No, let's quit. I wish they were all dead. I wish they were all dead. I wish they were all dead. I wish they were all dead! Lincoln... I'll kill them all. We'll kill them all together. - I gotta go. - Oh, yeah? When did you learn to act like such a man? It obviously wasn't from those high school girls. I bet they didn't even know what to do with you. I guess it just comes naturally. I'm gonna kill that fucking kid. So fucking weak, I can see it. He doesn't look so weak to me. Popped you pretty good. He got it worse, trust me. Be careful, Willie. Please... please help me. Who the fuck is that? Help me, Willie, please. You're gonna die. Wake up, Kaitlin! - Come on, you're on cleanup duty. - I'm coming. Oh, fuck. I don't believe this. I was just playing ball with him a few hours before. The divide between the self we present to the world - and our true inner self... - No, fuck that. No, Willie wasn't hiding this. I knew him better than any of you. He never would've... Never would've done this shit. It's truly very sad. But let's not allow sadness and grief turn to anger and negativity. Just remember that Willie was a young man who'd shown in his time here remarkable spiritual growth. You all right there, partner? Yeah, it's just a shock, you know? He was a good kid? Not really. You know, it's a... hour drive... every time I gotta come pick up a dead kid. Each way. I mean, these fuckups gotta quit killing themselves. Or else things will get difficult for y'all out here. I understand. Well, I hope that you do. 'Cause I can only keep the wolves from the door for so long. There was blood everywhere. I mean... I've seen people cut themselves, or whatever, but this... Willie must've been out of his mind. Maybe he was Borderline Personality. Maybe he hated himself as much as he hated everybody else. Maybe all the filth and nastiness just came pouring out of him at once and he slit his own fucking throat, I don't know. Look. Shit. Oh, fuck. Hey. - Are you okay? - Why wouldn't I be? This isn't a tragedy. I don't know, it's weird. I feel responsible. Like I made this happen. Willie'd love to hurt you. You should be high-fiving God, right now. You're free. That's the freakiest thing I've ever seen. Why would he do that to himself? Maybe... someone carved that into his skin, and then... murdered him. I don't know. Who would do that? They'll never fuck with us again. Hey. Iverson wants to see you. - Why? - What's it matter why? Come on. Look at me. Hey, look at me. You high? Did you get in a fight? - What? - Your cheek. Basketball. You and Willie didn't get along. We weren't friends. Come on, Lincoln. You're not in trouble. Talk to me. No, we didn't... we didn't get along. It's a mystery to me. Why some kids decide to pick on other kids. I'm sure Willie could answer that for you better than I can. How does that make you feel? That Willie's dead. I... - I feel bad for his family. - But relieved. I didn't say that. You can be honest. There's a part of you. Maybe just a really small part. - A part that's happy that Willie's dead. - Shut the fuck up! What is it? I feel like... something's out there. It's called guilt. Why would I feel guilty? 'Cause you killed Willie. - With your mind. - I didn't kill him. Jeez... you are stressed. - You know the other night? - Yeah? I felt these. Those are from my bad girl phase. Right above my cheerleader skirt. You're a cutter? I was. I was really hurting at the time, and... cutting made the pain feel like it's... under my control. It's my version of death metal. What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? Answer me! I could wipe you out. With my mind. So don't fuck with me. Fuck! Do you know whose blood this is? Do you miss him? I'll kill you! You hear me, I'll fucking kill you! Get the fuck out! You just do what they tell you, right? There's always one of you! You fucking coward! Moira Karp was a student here. She killed herself at the school. I also found this. The link is dead, but the original's still on this hard drive. They made it right here in this room. - This is the page they took down. - Who took it down? Probably Iverson covered up this sick mess. "Moira Karp's food diary: Come. More come. Even more come." They hated this girl. This was years ago. What does this have to do with Willie? I've seen her. Here. You all right, man? I have to warn them. Moira? Wanna try? Please... you have to stop this. But... This is what you wanted. Stop! I'm yours, Lincoln. And you're mine. Do you got a minute? Yeah. You were a student here, right? Before you started teaching? - A few years ago, yeah. - Maybe you can help me with something. I'm trying to find out about a girl who used to go here. Moira Karp. Where did you hear of her? Just around. Did you know her? - I wish I hadn't. - Why? Because she was evil. She was, Kaitlin. You would've thought so, too. She lied all the time, she got all of us girls in trouble. She just... she was crazy. Dangerous crazy. What happened to her? She killed herself. - Because of what the other girls did to her? - Because she was sick. Christine! Everyone, find your inner peace. Find your calm. Tend to your chores, tend to your chores. What did you see? I don't know. We need to talk. Lincoln, what happened? - I saw her. - Wait, you saw Moira? She killed Derek. She cut him into fucking ribbons. You killed them. - Is that what you... - No! Listen to me! - You can tell me the truth. - I am! If you did this, they got what they deserve. You stood up for yourself. How could you say that? It's payback, Lincoln. Fucking bullies, they're all the same. What would you know? You're the hot, popular girl that everyone likes. I know, okay? I know all about it. Nobody here knows this, but... There was a girl in my high school. She was my best friend growing up. And then she stole my boyfriend, and I turned everybody against her. I spread a rumor that she had herpes, I told her boyfriend, my ex, and I convinced him that she had lied. He was so pissed he gave me a bunch of naked photos of her. And I texted them around the school. I just wanted to shame her, you know? Put her in her place. I made her life hell. And it became like an addiction. I got a rush every time she cried. That's horrible. It gets worse. She killed herself. And I never expected it to go that far. You can imagine how terrible I have felt every day since then. And... And that's why I started things with you. I wanted to know what it felt like to be a victim. I wanted to help somebody for once, instead of hurting them. How could you? Was I... Was I just some freak... that you examined? - Why don't you... - No, no, no, please, please... please that's how it started... Do you know how that makes me feel? I'm sorry. I have to stop Moira before she kills someone else. You don't have to lie to me, I'm on your side. Stay away. Moira? Moira! Lincoln! You came! - Moira, you have to stop. - But they deserve it. - They don't deserve to die. - You wanted them dead, you said it. I didn't know you existed. You wanted it, Lincoln, I can feel it. I can feel your anger, it brought me back! - I was just scared. - We've both suffered alone. But now I can get all of them, we can do it together, kill everybody. - Whoever fucked with us! - Moira! You have to stop, please. - Don't say that! - Just go away! - I don't need you anymore. - Don't say that, please! - Don't be like the rest of them, please! - I don't need you anymore! Moira! Moira? I can't help you no more, Jack. It's a copycat thing, okay? One kid decides to do it, another kid decides to do it, too. I'll handle it. Enough of that crap. I've gotta call it in. Gotta send the kids home. Gotta shut it down, man. Can't do that. Some of these kids come from real dangerous homes. There's nothing more dangerous than this place. Look, you got until tomorrow morning... then I'm coming back, Jack. And I'm not coming alone. Kaitlin. Kaitlin. You're gonna get in trouble. Have you seen Kaitlin? What did it look like? I heard both his wrists were slashed. Leave me alone. I was just asking. Kaitlin. Did that hurt? Did that hurt? Yeah. What're we gonna tell the kids? That it's not their fault. Sheriff, you got an ETA? You've been gone all day. We can't keep pretending that everything's okay, we have to shut this place down. That's not gonna happen. And I'm coming back from... Third Eye Academy, what do they call it? We sinned, Jack. It's about redemption. But we're gonna have to pay. It's called the Mind's Eye Academy, Sheriff. Yeah, this place is fucked! How come you're out there? I didn't get a call. - I'll tell you all about it when I get back. - All right, copy that. What can I do? Leave. I have the strength to handle this. I have the strength to handle this. I have the strength to handle this. I have the strength to handle this. I have the strength to handle this. I have the strength to handle this. Jack. How'd you come back? Because I missed you so much. - You gave us no choice, Moira. - Liar! Don't take another step. Quiet, or I'll cut your fucking tongue out, Jack! - Eat what I tell you to eat! - What? Eat what I tell you to eat, when I tell you to eat it, right? We were only trying to help you. Stay down on your knees and eat this fucking dirt. We attune ourselves to the desert, to the Earth, and to the sky. Nobody's fed them. Why are you worried about the fucking horses? They're not turning up cut to pieces with words carved into their hooves. Everyone's saying they're gonna send us home after this assembly. I already called my mom, she's coming to pick me up tomorrow. You should come with us. I want to. But I have to make sure Kaitlin's okay. I can't leave her. - Hey! Where are you going? - I'm getting the fuck outta here. You can't just leave, Krauss, we have to take care of these kids. Are you kidding me? We are the last people that should be taking care of these kids. Something bad is happening here. You're scaring me, Krauss. You should be scared, we made a terrible mistake. I just hope... that there's something out there that can forgive us. Forgive you. Oh, shit. You're the dog that does whatever he tells you to do. His follower. His bitch. I didn't wanna go through with it. - Please, Moira... - There's always one of you. What do you want from me? Your pain. Hey, hey! Hey! Help, help me! Help me, help me. Fucking Moira, she's back there! Bring him in, get him in. Bitch! She's coming. You sure it was Moira? Yes. Why are we fucking waiting in the greenhouse? This is fucking bullshit. - You betrayed me, Lincoln. - I said I don't need you anymore! - Kaitlin does. - Come on, let's get the fuck outta here! I don't need you... Stop! I said stop! Stop! Do you feel that? Go ahead, do it! Do it! Now you know how it feels to be alone. - Tell me what's going on. - No, we have no time. - We have to get everybody outta here. - Shut up. Whose blood is on your shirt? - Isaac's. She killed him. - Who? Moira Karp. You fucking piece of shit liar. - Please, just listen... - Shut the fuck... - You killed Willie, didn't you? - Please... I'm calling the cops, and you're gonna tell 'em what you fucking did. How you killed Willie and Derek, and they're gonna put you away forever. I didn't kill 'em! Fuck. Moira? Try it. Help me. You want me to cut her? I want you to kill her. - She didn't do anything to you. - They're all the same. We can fix this, we'll tell everybody what happened. We'll expose the truth. Fuck the truth. - You're evil. - No, I am strong. - I let them hurt me, but not anymore. - I don't need you anymore. Please. Don't be like the rest. I don't need you anymore. Go away. You listen to me. You said you wanted to help me! Go away! Go away! It worked for Lincoln, go away! Stupid girl! I was just pretending! - I made you come back. - The fuck you did! Come on! Fuck. Get away from me! What are you doing? You. You come any closer and I swear I'll blow your fucking brains out, you little cunt. Did you lie to my parents about how I died? - We had no choice. - You had no choice? Do you remember the night I died, Christine? Say you remember. Do you remember how I died? Say it! I remember. The basement. The only place I felt safe from you and your awful friends. I was cutting myself. Little cuts to control the pain. - I will shoot you in the fucking face. - You were the worst! You made my life here hell! But Iverson let you get away with everything! You came down there to taunt me. To call me evil, and call me a cunt! And I couldn't take it anymore. So I attacked you. God, but I was so weak then. What happened next, Christine, do you remember? - I cut you. - That's right! You held me down and you took my blade, and you slit me open. Here! And here! And then you all came down to watch. Iverson, Krauss... you. I'm sorry. I didn't wanna die! I asked you to help me, don't you remember? I said, "Help me, please!" A troubled girl who killed herself. Iverson could make that work. And then you kicked me. Just to see if I was dead yet. That's the last thing I remember, is your foot pressing into my chest! - I don't wanna do this, Moira. - Oh, I think you do. - No, I don't. - I think you want it bad. Come on, Christine. Let me feel your hate. I'm so, so sorry. Come on! Lincoln. Oh, fuck. I fucked everything up. And I can't change that, but right now... I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone, and if I'm going to die here, I need you to believe that. You're not gonna die. Shit. None of this shit's gonna help us. You fucking traitors! My life was hell because of girls like you. Moira! What's it gonna take to stop you? Everybody dying. Oh, I dare you. Let's die together, Lincoln. I'm not afraid of you. You should be. Moira! Lincoln, no! Lincoln, no! Lincoln! I can't believe you did that. Please look at me. Lincoln, look at me. Lincoln, look at me. You're gonna be okay. I wish they were all dead. I wish they were all dead. I wish they were all dead. They'll never fuck with us, again.
