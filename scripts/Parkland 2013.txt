The two day, five speech four is political in that he's mending fences here. Police in Dallas have mounted the biggest security operation in their history.

But we couldn't let you leave Fort Worth without providing you some protection against the rain. I'll put it on in the White House on Monday.

Everything and anything involving the security of the Chief Executive has been checked, re-checked, and then checked again. Most of us here at the radio, TV, and press area... Turn it up. A huge broadcasting truck right near the Love Field freight terminal. We have an excellent view of the landing area and the dignitaries who will be greeting the President as he arrives. The area selected to afford maximum viewing for the public and grants access to the route of travel the motorcade will use into downtown Dallas. We going to be okay here? Oh, yeah. It's a good program. The President's plane, now touching down. Its wheels are down. Ana' the President and Mrs. Kennedy have arrived at Dallas, Love Field.

Sir, did you tell Harry you took film of the motorcade today? Yes. So you did, sir. You did film the motorcade. I said yes. And where were you standing at the time? I was on the concrete block over there. This first one, right here. Yes. Now were you filming before the President was shot? Sir, where you filming before the President was shot? Yeah. So you were standing on top of this, sir. Is that right? You couldn't have been more than 30 yards away. Sir, would you allow me to take that film into my possession? Right now, there are people out there who are ready to start a war. The film is that camera is the only way we have to know what happened out here today. You understand that? It's a matter of national security. I need to think. Sir, I'm no longer asking. The Dallas News can develop it. Let's go. Clear the way. Nurse. Can we get some tape here? Admiral George Burkley, the President's personal physician. The President has Addison's Disease. He'll need these. I have him on the leg. Injection is fine. What's the story on the priest?

Mr. President. He's gone. We need to get in the air. Hey, we belong to Johnson now. The whole federal government belongs to him. When Johnson goes, everyone has to go with him. Who stays with Jackie? Jackie isn't chief executive. Nor is she related to one... anymore. I'm not going anywhere without her. Let us recall for you now what has transpired. KRLD is reporting that they have been told by somebody in the hospital that the President is dead. Well, that is a repeat of something that you heard reported to you directly a moment ago from KRLD in Dallas. Ana' that is the rumor that has reached them at the hotel that the President is dead. I need to go call my wife. Look, if you want to stay, you can stay. If you want to go home and be with your family... Go be with your family. We do not know what his condition is, but the report is that the President is dead. This is not confirmed. This is something... Okay. This is something that the... Word just came to us a minute ago. The word we have is that President Kennedy is dead. He was shot by an assassin at the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets just as. Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Father. Thank you for taking care of the President. Please pray for him. I will. God bless you. God bless you. Father. God bless... Thank you. Let's do this. Why don't we put our lists together? We'll split them up and work down. I... I got to call you back. They just picked up somebody in Oak Cliff. They think he's the shooter. Shot and killed the same time as the President We now have the name of that suspect who has been picked up by Dallas, Texas police in connection with the slaying of a Dallas policeman. The story says the Dallas Police Department has arrested a 24 year old man identified as Lee H. Oswald in connection with the slaying of a Dallas policeman shortly after President Kennedy was assassinated. Oswald is also being interrogated to see if he had any connection with the slaying of the President. Did you hear that? I did hear that. Oswald was pulled screaming and yelling, from the Texas Theater in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. This story does not say that Oswald is the man wanted in connection with the slaying of the President. It says that he is wanted in connection. Is he talking about your brother? Bob? Is that your brother? I have to go home. ...has been apprehended. Police are apparently questioning both of them now. J. Edgar Hoover has ordered the full FBI... What are you saying? Oh, Christ. Jim. Just a minute. Wait. What? What are you looking for? Lee Harvey Oswald. What is this ? Why do you have this? Why the hell do you... This has got to be the guy. Why the hell do we have this? This guy works in the Depository. Yeah, a hundred feet from where the President was shot. For how long? I don't know. A month? What do you mean, a month? How do you know this? 'Cause I'm tracking him. Tracking him? Jesus! For how long? 18 months. Found it! Come here. Hosty's been tracking him 18 months. What the hell for? You know, I couldn't even tell you. He's just a sorry son of a bitch. He's one of these guys who says he's a Marxist, then he's a revolutionary. Revolutionary? For who? Nobody. Nobody wants this guy. He defected to the Soviets a couple years back. Now he's here? They didn't want him. Tried to off himself there They said he could stay as long as he didn't die. And I guess he got bored with that, came back. Fain did the follow up interviews on it. Yeah, a couple of them. Figured there was nothing there so he closed the file. It was right before he retired. Wife's Russian, so I checked up on her. Oswald was knocking her around some. That's why I put him back on the active list. You actually interview him? No, he was never around. When was the last time you tried? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago? Yeah. I saw the wife. Saw the wife. Well, today... her husband killed the President. Which one is Sorrels? I am. This is Secret Service business. Let me see it. F 1.8 zoom lens set for full close up. So, can you do it? 8 mil is tricky. There's always a risk with new technology. A risk of what? 8 mil is really 16 mil split in two. Each frame is really four frames together. Two running one way, two running the other. It means twice the risk of overexposure or destruction. And there's always a percentage of the film partially or fully destroyed in the process. Have you done much of this type of thing? Three, maybe four times. And how'd that go? Look we can still send it to Rochester if you want. We need to know who's behind this. We don't have that kind of time. Listen, I'm temporarily transferring possession to you. Nobody looks at it until we do, and nobody talks about what's on there. Mr. Zapruder. Is that okay with you? Yes. Okay. You okay? I'm upset. We're all upset. Latest news from Dallas. Vice-President Johnson is being rushed to the security of Air Force One for an emergency return to Washington. Nobody knows at this hour if the shooting is part of a wider plot or the act of one assassin. in Washington, nuclear missile silos are being prepared. Polaris submarine remain deployed, and the United States Air Force around the globe is on high alert. I have to go. We may have the shooter. Do not screw me, Harry! I don't want, what's on that film all over the papers. Film stays with Zapruder. No matter what anybody says, no matter what's on it, film doesn't leave you. Volunteer returning to Angel! We're leaving now! Let's go! Everyone ready? You all know what's on here, right? Ana' you're sure you're ready? I'm ready. That's my granddaughter. I'm sorry. I forgot. My grandson. It's your life, Mr. Zapruder. Looks like a good life. Oh, God. My God. You have everything. You have the whole god damn thing. Oh, my God. We're going to need some copies of that. I don't have the right machinery. You're going to have to go somewhere else. Mr. Zapruder. I wish you luck, sir. Do not stop! Go, go, go! All clear! This way, sir. Go! Go, go! Who are they? Dallas police and the FBI. You sure attract a crowd. He can ride with me. He came with us. He's leaving with us. Easy. Yeah, he said to meet him here. Gentlemen, thank you very much. We need three copies. One for the Secret Service. One for the FBI, and one for me. Let me through. Excuse me. Hold it. Excuse me. What are you doing? Who are you? I'm the medical examiner. This is a homicide case. The deceased can't leave until there's been an autopsy. This casket cannot leave the premises. I'm the special agent in charge of the White House detail for the Secret Service. That is the President of the United States and we are taking him back to Washington. That's not the way we do things around here. It's a Federal crime. No, it is not. There's no Federal statue. It's a murder, it's local, and it's under local jurisdiction. Earl, be very careful here. That is my body. The President is coming with us. You can't take him. We have laws here in Texas. The law can be waived. Not by me. I can't do it. Earl, let him go. Do you have any idea... any idea how difficult this has been for Mrs. Kennedy? I deal with widows everyday! The remains will stay here. I don't think so. The remains... What did you call it, your body? The hell with you, and the hell with your law. Move it out! The Dallas police is here to execute the laws of the state of Texas! Screw the lid on that coffin now! Let it go. You cannot take it. It's against the law to remove a corpse from the State of Texas without permission! Enough! You cannot fake it We're leaving. Move! It's okay, Earl. You did right. What a shitty place to die. You're not driving. What are you talking about? Don't. Please, allow me. It's okay. Ma'am. Bob Dugger, ma'am. God bless you. They're five minutes out. Where we putting the coffin? I don't know. I never thought about it. We're not flying it below like a piece of luggage. We're riding it right here. Let's get these two rows of seats off the plane. Look for a tool box. Get some tools up here, and bodies! Six bolts. I need a screwdriver. We go! four minutes. Six bolts tie it to the fuselage. You got it? You got them? One, two, three. Go, go, go. Let's go. Watch it. Watch the back. Come on. Come on you guys. Let's just get the hell out of here. All right, come on. Here we go. Keep the back end up. Keep the back end up! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch that corner. You're not going to make it. Let's go. Come on. Push it. All right, come on. Easy. Put it down. Slow... Dear God. This work okay, Dave? This is just fine, Lem. This is the first time the Secret Services has lost a president under its watch. I think it may be months from now. Hello, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm Robert Oswald. The man who shot the President, I'm his brother. Jackie. I will faithfully execute... The office of President of the United States... The office of President of the United States... I will, to the best of my ability... I will, to the best of my ability... - Preserve... - Preserve... - Protect... - Protect... - and defend... - and defend... the Constitution of the United States. the Constitution of the United States. - So help me God. - So help me God. So, you finally bothered to find me. I'll probably starve now. Momma's going to need money. Mother. I am responsible for two presidents. I'm sorry? Kennedy and now President Johnson. I'm not even a Democrat. Come on. Let's go. This room is bugged. Be careful. I don't care. If you know anything about this, I want to know what you know right now. And no damn stories. Well, I always knew Lee was some sort of secret agent. Didn't you? What are you talking about? They recruited him when he was in the Marines. Who's they? And what possibly for? We did. The U.S. government did. He was sent on dangerous missions. The first was to Russia. Okay, okay, let me get this straight. Lee, our Lee... is a super secret government spy? Mm-hmm. Come back from Russia with a 21 year old wife. She doesn't speak English. He can't hold a job. They have two kids and not a pot to piss in. That's impressive. That is a dangerous fellow, Lee. And then what? You know. You're insane. Don't you speak to your mother like that. Lee Harvey Oswald has done more for his country than any other living human being. I will never be ordinary again! I was thinking when I was waiting for you about that book I'm going to write. What book? It will have to be very deeply researched. A publisher, with money, will have to come with a paid writer to do the work. Mother... I just want to make sure you understand what is happening here today. Your son, my brother... has apparently killed the most important person in the world. And if that is true, he is going to die for what he has done. It's my story, too. There he is. There's Oswald. Oswald say, "I did not shoot anybody." Hold on. Hold on. I remember this guy. Hey, Adam? What? He was here. Who was here? Oswald was here, in the office. He left something for Hasty. Oh, Christ. Jesus. Mrs. Oswald! Mrs. Oswald! Mrs. Oswald! Did he do it? Mrs. Oswald. Your mother's a piece of work, I'll give her that. I don't know what we're going to do. I've got two kids. Well, we're all fathers. You, me... the police officer your brother shot point blank. The President. Well, they were. If I were you, I'd consider changing my name. I'd pray I never needed the help of the Dallas Police Department or the Federal government again. I'd pack your things and your wife and those two children of yours, and I'd move as far from here as I could. I'd never come back, even to die. But... that's just me. Oswald has been charged with the murder of a police officer. Where the hell have you been? I was out doing my job. Doing your job, huh? What's this? Shit, I get three of these things every week. This one's from Oswald. Oswald left this for you ten days ago. "You've been talking to my wife Marina and I don't like you. "You need to stop talking to Marina "or there will be a price to pay." I've got 100 of these things. It says that he's going to blow up the office. Three times a week I get shit like this. But this was written by the assassin of the President! And it was delivered to this office in person ten days go, Jim, which means we had the assassin of the President in our office threatening a Federal officer, which is a crime Not ten days ago. We did not have the assassin of the President. for which he could be arrested. We had another goddamn delusional nobody! Yeah, well he's a somebody now! Never said one word about killing the President! No, Only you! Well, if I worried about every son of a bitch who wants to shoot me, I'm in the wrong goddamn business! Listen. The world is not going to care about you. They're going to say that we had him. We had him, and we could have stopped him! Jesus Christ. This might be, probably is, now that I think about it the biggest fuck-up in the history of American law enforcement. Fuck! You, follow me. All right, give me your hands. Need some help with that? No, I got it. I need some help from you to shut up. Sit down, Lee! How are you? I don't think you've ever asked me that question in my life. I'm really confused. Maybe you can tell me what... what... What is going on? I don't know. They have your pistol, they have your rifle, and they've charged you and you're telling me you don't know. God damn it, just tell me what you did. Don't believe all this so-called evidence. What's Marina going to do with the kids now? I don't know. Well, we have friends. Junie needs new shoes. Oh, she needs new shoes. How about a goddamn father? How about a killer for a father? How about the killer of the President for a father? You're worried about shoes. Do you have any idea what you've done? You've ruined that kid's life. Both those kids' lives! So forget the goddamn stupid shoes! Can you hear me ? Put the phone to your ear, all right? Look at me. I'm sorry. Well, I'm going to get you a lawyer. Stay out of it. Stay out of it? My children, my wife, my children's children, all of us, for all of eternity. You did this to all of us. I don't know who you think you are, but I am your brother. And I'll find you an attorney and be back in a day or two. Don't be running back and forth all the time and getting yourself in trouble with your boss. Time to go. What did he say? I don't know. I have no idea who that was. Thank you, sir. It's been ringing all night. Everybody wants that film. Hello? I'd like to speak to Mr. Zapruder, please. This is Abraham Zapruder. My name is Dick Stolley. I'm the editor of Life magazine. I'd like to talk to you tonight about your film. You know what? Not tonight. No. I'm very tired. I'm upset. It's been an upsetting day. I'm sure you can understand. I understand completely, but I need to come see you as soon as possible. Yeah, tomorrow morning, okay. Okay, tomorrow morning then. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Let's go home, Abe. It's enough. It's enough. My eyes. We're about to wind this up for tonight, because all that could happen on one day has. For some final reflection on one of the more horrible days in American history, you find there is a great deal that could be said about the political and other changes that we can look forward to now, but I think it would be bad taste to go into it now. And I won't. It has all been shocking. By the Washington clock, at a little after one o'clock this afternoon, President Kennedy was alive as any human being ever gets, young, strong, vigorous, looking forward to, no doubt, five more years, he hoped of leadership in this country and of the western world. There is no more news here tonight, and really no more to say, except that was has happened today has been just too much, too ugly, and too fast. Good morning, lam Dr. Perry. What seems to be bothering you? How's our patient doing? Fine. And our resident? Okay, good. Turn off the lights please. Jesus Christ. We blew it. Shut up! Did you see that? Did you see that? We blew it! That wasn't a damn Easter parade, that's the President of the United States! Do you understand me! You think we need your goddamn opinion about anything! No, sir. I've been doing this job for 30 years! I have never lost my man! This was not supposed to happen! Yesterday, I lost my man. Thank you, gentlemen, if you would wait outside for a moment please. Thank you. This is no time to point fingers. This is a time of... Dick Stolley. Life magazine. We spoke last night. Yeah, I know who you are. My father brought my family over here 40 years ago to escape certain death. We worked hard, built a good, honest life. An American life. Sir, we'd like to talk to you about making a deal. But I guess all of that is over. Nothing is ever going to be the same. I wish I never took this film, Mr. Stolley. But now I'm going to have to live with it. Don't make a deal without talking to us first, sir. I admire you, you know. I've been to war. Know what it's like to use a camera. You kept shooting. No, no. It wasn't a war, Mr. Stolley. I filmed a murder. Mr. Zapruder, we're going to slip an offer underneath the door. God, if I open this door, it is going to be impossible for both of us. Don't make me negotiate with those people. Don't make me go out there. Life magazine is just as anxious as you are to give your pictures a respectable display. Mr. Zapruder, CBS. Well, that is why you are standing in this room, Mr. Stolley, because I trust that. I trust your magazine. And I want to say very clearly I know what this is, and what it's done. What it is going to do. So if you want a chance to do the right thing with this film then you're going to have to pay for it. You have to pay to keep it safe and to protect me and my family. I think I understand. And one other thing. When the President is... when he's The kill shot? Yeah. You will publish those frames? Because I think you would agree, some things the world does not need to see. Would you not? Normally yes, but in this case missing frames could lead to false speculation. That is none of my business. I don't... I don't care about all of that. I'm talking about the man's dignity. We have a responsibility. A dignified man, you understand. It's a very undignified end for a very dignified man! You have something to write on? There is the prisoner. There is Lee Harvey Oswald. What? He has been shot! He's been shot. Lee Oswald has been shot! There's a man with a gun. Oswald has been shot! Right now. Jesus Christ, right on live TV. God damn! Absolute panic here at headquarters. Oswald has been shot. There is no question. Os weld has been shot. Detectives have their guns drawn. We have not heard from Mr. Stolley or his associates at Life magazine since yesterday evening. And Lee Oswald's wife and children and I... are stranded alone at a strange motel in the middle of nowhere. We are waiting to hear about our cash deal. Thank you. I shall be waiting right here. We are the Mrs. Oswalds. We need money. We need a place to stay where we can hide from everyone and we need a new place to live, dear heart. All we do is rush around from one place to another, in the grand exodus. The baby's diapers are wet. We are hungry as all get out. Mother! Hey, Mike. Get out here. Something's going on. They're running around outside. Don't get excited. Lee's been shot. It isn't serious. And they got the man who shot him. Where are they taking him? Parkland. No! He is not living or dying in there. Room two! How many bullets? Where's the respirator? Where's Perry? Gauze. There's Clark. What's the blood pressure? 100 over 85. It's going down. I don't like this. Let's open him up. We're going to need some suction. Get suction ready. From one bullet? Yeah, one point blank. Let's start left, go right. Right kidney gone, spleen gone. We're going to have to get in there. Right there. Need more gauze. Got it. BP 100 over 85. We might get to keep this one. Do we want to? We need a confession. What if he dies? We need a confession first. Don't we all. Damn it! Blood pressure is going down. 85 over 40. We need more blood! Nurse. Zero, nothing. I've got the lung. Massage the heart. Nothing. Adrenalin now. Adrenalin! Come on! All right, Jim hold it right there. Open! Nothing. Jim, paddles! Paddles. Paddles. Paddles. Clear. Nothing. Again. Clear. Nothing. Still nothing. Clear. Nothing. Clear. Time. 1:07. Dammit. Yes, this is Mike Howard. I'm sorry, will you repeat that? Thank you. He's gone? I'm sorry, Robert. Lee was an agent for the U.S. government. He should be buried at Arlington Cemetery with President Kennedy. Shut up, mother. He's staying here. This time, I don't think anyone's going to give you a hard time. Your name is Robert. Is that right, son? That's right. I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry for everybody. ...a brief stop at the White House... Then Mrs. Kennedy followed the casket on foot... t0 St. Matthews Church. I don't think you all should listen to this. No, please leave it. Thank you. Bring him in. Close the blinds for me. We're getting killed, Jim. What happened in this office... What we did... what you did... What do you want, Gordon? You were in the military, right, Jim? Yeah, Army. Are you firing me? I don't ever want to see that again. What the hell am I supposed to do with it? Oswald's dead now. A thousand what-ifs. 86 'em. This is evidence. Well it's not evidence if there's no trial. And there sure as shit won't be a trial now. I know what that is, Jim. I'm asking you to destroy it. I think we all know what is at stake here. Wait... You want this? Why aren't we doing this in the church? Well, no church will do it. What about that cemetery chapel over there? They won't allow it either. You only have this grave site because a friend owed me a favor. And I'm sorry, but there are no pallbearers. Can you help us, please? Thank you. The remains of John F. Kennedy are about to pass a memorial to another president. The stamina of this woman... through these past three or four days has been indescribable. I haven't done a burial in eight years, but someone has to help this family. God of the open sky and of the infinite universe, we pray and petition for this family who are heartbroken. Those who suffer and in his hearts are full of fears... we'll pray for them. For their need is great. May God have mercy on your soul. ...or if these dark days are harbingers of even blacker ones to come, Might the black before the dawn... lead to some still as yet indiscernible sunrise of understanding among men. Violent words, no matter what their origin or motivation. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed an' thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Tonight, there will be few Americans who will go to bed without carrying with them the sense the! somehow they have failed. If in the search of our conscience we find a new dedication to the American concept that brook no political, sectional, religious or racial divisions. Ana' it may yet be possible to say that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not die in vain. That's the way it is, Monday, November 25th, 1963. This is Walter Cronkite. Good night.
