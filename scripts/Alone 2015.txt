I cant miss it. Baby, its my birthday. We can at least have dinner together. Sanjana, we can celebrate your birthday tomorrow. This meeting is important. I need to go. Ill see you at home. And yeahhappy birthday. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday! Anu! Oh my, God! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Sanjana. Happy birthday to you! - Thank you. Thank you so much, Anu. Its so sweet of you. Dont thank me, thank your husband. Hes organized all this. Kabir? But hes busy with some.. - He knew hell be late. Thats why he organized this party.. ..and called us all here. Come on. Cut the cake before your birthday gets over. Cut my birthday cake without Kabir? Never. Sanjanaits hard to say who loves whom the most? You both are mad. Absolutely crazy. Honestlyyou two make me really jealous. By the waymeet my cousin Chitra. Hi. - Happy birthday. Thank you. I am sorry for coming here uninvited. Are you mad? Youre most welcome. - Thank you. Sanju, shes an expert tarot card reader. If theres anything you want to know anything about yourself. Here she is. She knows everything. I hope you dont mind. I dont believe in these things. Why learn about yourself from others? And Ive got everything. And Im doing good. Of course you are. But dont you want to know.. ..whether youll always have it or not? You always end up losing.. ..everyone you love...or is close to your heart. Right or wrong? A bit of both. Have you lost something? Strange, because this card indicates that.. ..youre going to find what you lost. Maybe someones coming back. The moons missing from the sky. And descended in my home. I am so fortunate.. Like my wish has been fulfilled. My loveI cant live a moment without you. Your desires made me crazy. Kabir, I want some Us time. Ive told you a thousand times before. I dont want nothing and no one between us. Just you and me. But you cant live with me. Theres always some surprise, or party, the people And then theres your career your meetings, your job. Sanjana, you wanted to flee from Kerala, right? You wanted to come here. To start a new life. A better life, better lifestyle. Isnt that what we needed to be happy, right? But for that, one has to work...stay apart for a while. I dont want to stay apart. I dont want this. I just want you. Your time, your company. Am I asking for too much? Fleeing from Kerala didnt mean that we grow apart too. What do you want me to do, Sanjana? Quit my job and stay at home to assure you nothing has changed. Everything Everything is still the same. Or lets go to Kerala? Would you like that? No. The root of this problem is this place. Lets just go back. No. Neither that city, nor that house. That place is littered with Anjanas memories. Everywhere I wont go back to Kerala. No! Hello. Okay. What happened? Moms in the hospital. Well have to go to Kerala. You okay? I cannot forgive myself. I am selfish, Kabir. Not at all. Not at all. If I hadnt insisted for an operation.. ..then Anjana wouldve been.. - Sanjana. I wasnt you, it was the operation. No one wants to be born like this. No one wants a life like this. It was an accident. A mishap. Not selfishness. Look, she suffered a serious blow to her head. Shes paralyzed neck down. She cant speak or walk. Also, theres a blood clot in her brain. We found it in her MRI scan. We need to operate on her. Thank you, doctor. Sanjana. Come on, Leo. Yes, Ill take that. Thank you. Yes sir. Shall we? 12345! Anjana! Sanjana? Are youMangala? How are you? Im okay. And you? I am fine. Its alightokay-okay. Hows madam? Shes being treated. Its serious. Shes my daughter-in-law. - Hello. My sons biggest mistake. They got married three months ago. So I brought her here, to work with me. I see. Do you know what happened that day? That accident? Ive no clue. But there was a big storm that night. It was such a fierce storm.. ..that the outhouse ceiling collapsed. Madam was lying outside the outhouse, unconscious. Outhouse? Why do you always keep it locked? Why dont you open it? How can we, sir? Its been closed for 7 years. Ive been working here for only 5 years. I asked madam once, and she said.. ..this was Sanjana and Anjanas playroom. After Anjanas death, Sanjana locked this place. She said, this place is filled with Anjanas memories. Her toys, and.. And Anjana too. - Mother! What nonsense. Anjana too! Please open it. Sir.. - Get the key, please. Thank you. - Let's go. Who is it? OhKabir! Oh, God! You scared me. And you amaze me. What are you doing here at 2 oclock in the night? KabirI heard some noises. What noise? Are you crazy? Really, Kabir. I heard some noises, and came to inspect.. - Sanjana. I wouldve heard them too, right? You didnt hear anything? - No. Come on. - Kabir, trust me. I heard some noises. It must be coming from some other house. Lets go back to sleep, come on. Mr. Kabir. - Yeah. There have been some complications. We need to operate immediately. I think you should get her as quick as you can. What? Paging for Sister Parvati. Sister Parvati please report to ward 5. Sister Parvati please report to ward 5. Yes, Mohit, go ahead. What? No, Mohit, you cant take a leave. Kabir! Sorry. Mohit, firstly I am not in the office. And now you want a leave too. Those are very important clients. Somebody has to be there to handle them. Who will do it? I dont know. I am stuck in this goddamn place. And why did all the mothers have to fall sick at the same time? I just dont.. Ill call you back. Sanjana, I am sorry. I didnt mean that. Sanjana. I am sorry. Actually, I am quite stressed because of the work.. Just go, Kabir. Dont worry about me. Ill handle everything here. And anyway, what will you do here? Just go. I wanted your support, not your favor. Come on, Sanjana, youre making a big deal out of this. I am not going anywhere. And I wont go until mom doesnt get well. But I will stay distracted.. I cant help that. I know that. I am used to it. Dealing with my problems alone. Keeping my emotions to myself. For Gods sake Sanjana, all I said was.. Excuse me. The operation was successful. But you cant meet your mom right now. In the meantime, you can complete some hospital formalities. Please - Ok - Thank you. Thank you. Ill take care of it. Its alright. Ill do it. Sanjana, I said Ill take care of it. Kabir! Namir sir? You? Its.. I cant believe it. How are you? - Good, sir. Good. But, siryou just disappeared for years. No contact or anything. What are you doing here? Whatre you doing here? - Catch your breath first. Well.. After seeing you, I am perfectly alright. You havent changed at all. Still the same. Looks and wits. What are you doing here at this hour? Well, sir, my mother-in-laws been admitted in this hospital. You dont worry, shes in safe hands. This is a good hospital. And then I am there. Let me know if I can be of some help. I'll Do It. Thank you so much, sir. I know. But first tell me what are you doing here? I am a psychologist in this hospital. And I also run a Healing Institute in Kottayam. Healing Institute? - Yeah! These days I do everything. Spiritual healing, etcetera.. I have students, I also teach. Keep my card. - Thank you, sir. II will call you, sir. Sure? - Well definitely meet. Yeah! Okay. You take care. Okay? It was nice seeing you, sir. - Same here, Kabir. Kabir. Kabir. I saw her in the lift. - Saw who? Shes there? - Who? Can I say something? Will you believe me? What is it? Shes here, Kabir. I can feel her. Feel who? Anjana. Sanjana, please. Were educated people. Dont talk like a bloody illiterate. Kabir How long will it take to fix this? Maximum 3-4 days. Excuse me. Maximum 3-4 days. Oh Okay. Please start work. - Okay. Leo. Leo. Leo. Leo. Where is he? Leo. Leo. STAPU! I am sorry to say, but your wife has had a miscarriage. Kabir. Didnt I tell you.. I told you shes in this house. Kabir, shes trying to harm me. Kabir, please believe me. I saw her last night. Kabir. Last night, in the courtyard downstairs.. Weve had a miscarriage! We lost our child! Why didnt you tell me earlier? I wanted to but I was scared. I didnt want nurture any deformed kids. Like Anjana and Me. Whether deformed or abnormal.. ..but, they wouldve been our kids. You hid such a big truth from me. Why? You were drifting away from me. After the child, you wouldve drifted further away from me. The truth is, Kabir, I cant stay away from you. I cant let anyone come between us. Between uswhat madness is this? And children dont create rifts. They fill the void, Sanjana! You couldve done it too. Youve bloody lost it, Sanjana. And its all in your head, not in this house. Because its completely empty. Its filled with negative thoughts, fear and illusions. Theres nothing here. - Kabir. And look at the consequences. Weve lost our baby. - Kabir. Sanjana dear My mother once said to me.. If you keep a knife under your pillow.. ..you wont see nightmares about ghosts and evil spirits. Will you try? Here. Kabir. Kabir, She.. What? Youre bleeding. Kabir, I.. - What, Sanjana? Theres no one here. Youve lost your mind. She.. I am sorry. I am going crazy. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am crazy. I am going crazy. - Calm down, okay. Kabir... Please help me. So Sanjana, tell me something about your childhood. What do I say? I have so many childhood memories. So many untold stories. Who were you closer to in your childhood? Your motheror father? My sister, Anjana. Anjana. - What? Well never separate. Promise? - Promise! Just one sip. Please, dear. So why did you two decide to separate? I.. Okay, okay, okay Stop. Enough for today. Well continue in the next session, okay. Now, relax. Kabir. It is a very delicate case. We need to handle it sensitively. Shes been through a lot. Sisters deathher miscarriage. Mothers accident. For sometime believe what she says. But, sir.. - Listen to me, Kabir. Just agree to what she says, what she thinks. Dont fight with her. Even if you dont believe, understand? Yes. Another thing. I think she needs a break. Take her out, in the open air. Lets see if staying away from this home makes a difference. Where are you taking me? Ready? - Ready. Kabir, this This is a dream, where there is you, me and no one else. This is your time. Not even mine. I am really sorry, Sanjana. I didnt try to understand you.. ..and left you alone. Pleaseit was my fault too. I wanted to impart love.. ..instead I just became a burden. I always thought about myself. I should say sorry. - Enough. Were done apologizing. Please forget everything. Kabirmother? If theres an emergency, the doctors will call us. Ive taken care of it. Trust me. And your trip to Mumbai? Changed your mind? Yes. I changed my mind. About returning to you. Brought me close to youmade me restless. Made me crave for you! Made me crave for you! Lost control.. Lost control.. Lost control.. My hearts lost control. Lost control.. Lost control.. Lost control.. My hearts lost control. Gives rise to desires in the first rain. Makes the heart beat faster. Restless by nature, calls out to you. Makes me cry when youre away. And no matter how I try.. ..its impossible to pacify. Brought me close to youmade me restless. Made me crave for you! Made me crave for you! Lost control.. Lost control.. Lost control.. My hearts lost control. Lost control.. Lost control.. Lost control.. My hearts lost control. Lets wander in those lanes again. Where the breeze of love always flew. Why dont we meet like strangers again? And introduce each other once again. And lose my heart again, after meeting you. Brought me close to youmade me restless. Made me crave for you! Made me crave for you! Lost control.. Lost control.. Lost control.. My hearts lost control. Lost control.. Lost control.. Lost control.. My hearts lost control. What happened? What happened? - Kabir.. That hand.. It was a hand.. Kabir.. - Theres nothing. Its nothing. It didnt make a difference, sir. She thinks Anjanas following her everywhere. Sir, its said that, if one of conjoined twins die.. ..the other doesnt live for too long. Doctor, I know I know this is all a.. - Hold on. You will have to understand.. ..that Anjana and Sanjana were connected together.. ..even by soul, and not just physically. Dont you see? Although through fear, but theyre still together. Sir, I admit youre right. But Sanjanas problems started after we arrived in Kerala. Do one thing. Consult the doctor and see.. ..if Sanjanas mother can be shifted to one of Mumbais hospital? I could do that. All your work done? Yes. Everything done properly? Yes Sister. All done. Mangla. Lock the doors. Sorry, madam. I forgot. Ill lock the door. How could I forget? Doc, I just want to know.. ..if we can shift her to Mumbai? Its important for me to go. And shell get treatment as well. Mr. Kabir. Treatment is one thing. But she is no condition to travel. Sorry. I cant take that risk. - I Understand. When you met Kabir first time? Thank you. Sanjana. - Anjana. Kabir. Happy birthday. Thank you. This is for you. Hey.. Sanjana, Im going to London for higher studies. London? But why didnt you tell me this earlier? And now suddenly.. - After my parents divorce.. ..dad shifted to London. He got me admission in the Leigh University. So I have to go. - But for how long? Years! Wont you come to the airport, to see me off. Of course I will. I will see you there. Thank you, bye. - Bye. Kabirs going to London, for years. Hes called me to the airport. I dont want to go anywhere. Anjana, lets go please. - No. Anjana, please. - No! Anjana, lets go please. - No. After that it was difficult for us to stay in contact. I could neither write a letter or an email. Nor call him. Anjana! Anjana, please give it to me. Anjana. - SAYAD MAI YAHI CHAHATI THI KE HUM DONO SATH RAHE?? So I would hide the letters I wrote. Perhaps! Time went on. Kabir had been away for 10 years. And one day. Hi. Kabir, you? Guess what? I am coming back. To you. Youre coming back. When? I cant believe this. I am coming back soon, Sanjana. And this time youll have to come to the airport to receive me. I dont know how, but you will have to come. Okay? Yes, I will come. I definitely will. No one can stop me this time. Good. Okay, Ill have to go now. Ill see you soon. Okay. - Bye. Kabir is coming back. And he wants us to receive him. Meet him. You can meet him, not me. Anjana, stop being so obstinate. Were no longer kids. I want to meet him, Anjana. He loves me, and I love him so much. This time I will meet him, Anjana. Even if it means separating from you. And thats when you decided on separating from Anjana. Yes, it was my decision. And I blame myself for her death. Yes, I killed her. If thats true, then you still have no reason to feel so guilty. Its not wrong to think about yourself. Sometimesits not a crime to be selfish either. Youre human, not God. I was trying to be God. Made a decision about someone elses life. She couldve lived her life, still be alive.. ..but I took it away. But shes back now. Shes following me. She wants to take me with her. Sanjana. Sanjana. Please try and understand. Its the effect of her death which youre still carrying along. Your fear is just the burden on your heart. The day you stop blaming yourself. You will stop seeing Anjana as well. Kabir! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanja.. Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana! Sanjana, wake up. Wake up. Sanjana, what are you doing here? Kabir! - Why are you here? I dont know, Kabir. I dont know. I dont know. Kabir, I am scared. Enough. Enough. Stop Crying. Enough. Enough. Calm down. Enough. Enough! Enough. What??? Isnt one ghost enough in this house? Oh mother, your records stuck to one thing. I told you a thousand times theres no such thing as ghost. But no. Madam said it for the sake of her child. The sister said for the sake of her sister. So why wont you believe it? Mother, everyone has a soul. In their body. Once the body perishes the soul wont come back. You confused me now. Inside the body or outside? Leave this. First go make breakfast and serve it. Go. Body or outside? What are you looking at? - You. Because I want to... What else you feel now? Im feeling affectionate. There are so many things in my heart. I want to say everything. Sanjana, what's stoping you? Stay with meforever. Sanjana, I have to go. Go but come back soon. I promise. Mother. Mother. Mother. - What is it? - Mother. I saw Sanjana madam. She was lying on the floor in the outhouse.. ..Clutching on to her sisters clothes and toys. And when I went closer.. ..she stared back at me as if she was possessed. Enough about ghosts and spirits. Hold this. Mother.. Mother. Mother. Believe me, Im telling you the truth. Be quiet, keep this plate. Mother, take a look. Please come take a look. Mother! You dropped the plate. Wheres your mind? Sorry, madam, I.. - Its alright. It happens sometimes. Next time, concentrate on your job.. ..not the people in this house. Yes. You.. Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. What.. No one can love you as much as I do. And no matter how many times I say this.. ..its not enough. No matter how much I express my love.. ..its never enough. Sanjana. No one will come between us now. Only you... and Me! Whats wrong, Sanjana? Somethings different about you. What? Dont know. Theres something... but...can't go away from you. Embrace me in you. Dont leave any part of me in me. You dont remember who you are. I dont remember who am I? Come embrace me. And let me hide you in my arms. Ill trickle drop by drop. And stay on your body. Ill trickle drop by drop. And stay on your body. Empty the sea "fill me with it. Let me drink you up. Quench my thirst. Bring some clouds. And make them shower on me. Let me drench you with drops. You dont remember who you are. I dont remember who am I? Come embrace me. And let me hide you in my arms. Ill trickle drop by drop. And stay on your body. Ill trickle drop by drop. And stay on your body. Ill trickle drop by drop. And stay on your body. Ill trickle drop by drop. And stay on your body. Ill go see the doctor, okay? Mom. What happened? I dont know. She was trying to say something. I dont know what happened. - Yes, doctor. Yes.. Okay, doctor. Doctor everything is ok? Yes. I mean nothing to worry. - No nothing to worry. The good we reach on time. Otherwise... So, hows Sanjana now? - Shes much better now, sir. Meaning. - I mean the guilt about Anjana. The nightmares, depression.. Its.. Its all gone. Disappeared. And I just want to thank you, sir. Youre the reason why I found my old Sanjana back. Thank you so much. Coffee. Hi, Sanjana. - Hi. Sorry, excuse me. Yeah, Mohit. Tell me. Divya was speaking about you. She was saying lets invite Kabir and Sanjana for lunch. Well, thats not my bloody problem. I said Good idea, lets plan it out today. Just send them the logistical plan.. She was also planning on watching a film. But But, there must be a different way. I am sure theres something you can do. Your husband is a busy man. You must feel lonely, right? Seriously, Mohit, I cant handle it. I know your mothers sick, but until I come back.. Hello. You know this project is very important for us. We cannot afford to make any more mistakes. Sanjana. And the requirements from their company.. Sanjana. I am sorry. Ill make the coffee. - No. Ill make it. And, did the Customs release the shipment? Are you okay? - Yes. Im absolutely fine. After a decade I am finally happy. Thank you. Sorry, sir, it was an important call. Couldnt avoid it. Leo, shut up. Shut up! Shut up! I wonder whats wrong with Leo. He suddenly got violent. Started barking at Sanjana. I thinkhe needs counseling as well. Kabir, this is serious. Animals can see what humans cant. Its call Extra Sensory Perception. Its weird that he got violent like this.. ..after seeing Sanjana. Maybe he sees the change that you did. Something isnt right. Sir.. Such drastic change in such a short time is not normal. Such people hide things. Something goes on in their mind.. ..but, they dont reveal it. They want people to consider them normal.. ..but, they are actually not. Sir.. Sir, I dont understand. Watch her. Keep an eye on her. And keep this between us. Help. Help. Kabir. - Sanjana. Kabir, help me! Help me. - Leo! Leo, stop it. Leo. No, Leo. - Help me, Kabir. No, Leo. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother, I.. - Why are you shivering in this weather? Are you sick? - I wont work in this house. You wont work here? Why? Mother, I am scared of Sanjana madam. Scared of Sanjana madam? Why? Mother, I was collecting my purse.. ..and looked out the window. Help. Help. Kabir, help me! Help. Kabir, help me! Help. Kabir, help me! Kabir! Leo! Kabir. - Leo. Leo, stop it. Leo. Leo, leave her. Kabir, help me! What do you think, Kabir? - I dont know, sir. I cant understand. I mean... Theres something always happening in this house. One things over and another springs up. I just dont know what to do. Sir.. Yes, Mangla. Sir, I dont know whether you believe in these things or not. Butsomeone cast an eye on this house. With your permission Ill conduct veneration in this house. And everything will be fine after that. Fine. Sanjana! Just like here are two kinds of humans. Similarly, there are two kinds of spirits. Good and bad. Bad spirits often possess weak bodies. Trouble them. And later kills them. The way your wifes getting weak.. ..shes getting seriously ill.. ..it proves that her sisters spirit is possessing her. But she wont posses her for long. Soon she will kill her. We have very little time. This Bhoot Puran has been written by ascetics.. ..thousands of years ago. We can use the chants written in them to control the spirit. Destroy all the belongings of her sister. Cover every glass in this house. Mirrors, photoseverything. Because, as soon as I start reciting.. ..the spirit will try to hide in these things. And this shouldnt happen. Ive bounded all the corners of this house. Well have to destroy this spirit right here. Once I start reciting the chants.. ..the spirit can lie, try to distract us. Shell try to scare us. But well have to be brave. Cover her face. MANTRA... MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA Kabir! Kabir! No... MANTRA Kabir...don't go! Kabir! Leave me! Help me! Kabir...help me! Help me... MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA No... Let her go. You dont belong to this world. Go back to wherever you came from. I cant.. Leave her and go back. Go back to your world. I wont go untilI dont kill her. Be quiet. Go awayor else Ill turn you to ashes. Go! Find the truth. Youll get me out of her body but, how will you get me out of this house? She killed me! Killed me! She killed me. Took my life. Try to find the truth. The truth. MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA MANTRA The spirit is out of her body.. ..but, shes not in my control. Shes still somewhere in this house. You okay? My heads paining. The effect wont wear off so soon. What happened with me, Kabir? What happened? Sanjanas returned to me after a long time. Let me take her in my arms first. Then Ill tell you what Anjana did. She killed me. Killed me. She took my life. Did Anjanas truth scare you, or Sanjanas lie? What do you mean? Whats all this? All I got was lies, so I thought.. ..to know the truth, I must lie too. Stop talking in riddles. Be specific. Even I am trying to solve the puzzle. Tell me what you did? Who did you kill? What was the lie did you always tell me? Tell me, Sanjana! I never lied to you. You didnt lie to me, but you didnt tell me the truth either. Anjanas spirit is still in this house. And she wont leave you alone until you dont speak the truth. Sanjana, I dont want to argue with you.. ..or, raise my voice. Its even your responsibility to keep this relation intact. Now the choice is over. The truth might not keep us together.. ..but, a lie will definitely shatter it. Okay, Sanjana. Your silence has conveyed your decision. But Sanjana, everyone has to pay for their deeds. Youll have to pay for yours. But I still love you. Kabir, stop. Please dont go. I love you very much. Please dont leave me. I will tell you the truth. I will tell you everything. Please dont leave me. Please dont leave me. I will tell you everything. Please. Kabir is coming back, and he wants us to receive him. Meet him. You can go, not me. This time I will meet him, Anjana. Even if I have to separate from you. Kabir doesnt love you. He just wants to separate us. So hes pretending to love you. Otherwise, what else could be the reason.. ..that he loves you instead of me. Whats wrong with you, Aanjana? Have you lost your mind? He only loves me. He only considers you as a good friend. You snatched Kabir from me. You came between us. Because I know he loves me. And I love him. Thats not true. Kabir only loves me, not you. Nothen Ill make sure that he only loves me. Anjana! Anjana! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Save my child. I beg you. That day mom saved me.. ...because it was an accident. I didnt want to kill her. I was only trying to save my life. Sanjana, why didnt you tell me this before? Because I didnt want to lose you. So sorry, Sanjana. I didnt know that my love for one.. ..would be the cause of death for another. Remember one thing. Anjana really loved you. And I love you. So sorry, Sanjana. This means Anjanas spirit is here to take revenge.. ..and, she wont leave without it. Theres something Anjanas spirit is tethered to. Before she attacks Sanjana again.. ..youll have to find that thing and burn it. What happened? Sanjana, hes saying theres.. Its coming from here. Anjana! Mother.. Well have to burn this body right now. Go get kerosene. Walk faster. Mother.. Come on, mother. Come on, mother. Mother Jaya! Jaya! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother Why are they taking so long? Ill take a look. Thank God youre here, sir. We found Anjanas dead body. We just need kerosene.. - Kerosene. You have the kerosene? I found this when I went in the house. I.. You should never try to fool your kin. Kabir! Kabir! Kabir! Kabir! Kabir! Sanjana! Burn her body. Move! Go! Kabir! Kabir! Kabir! Kabir! Kabir! Kabir! Kabir, are you okay? Kabir! What do I call you? Sanjanaor Anjana? Mom.. Kabirwhat are you saying? What do I call you? ThatsSanjanas body, isnt it? No, Kabir. I am Sanjana. Lie. How many times are you going to lie? Pleasetell me the truth now. Tell me the truth. Kabir.. - Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth. No, then Ill make sure that he only loves me. Mom, please. From now, I am Sanjana. I could not help it, Kabir. I loved you like crazy. I wanted you. I couldnt live without you. You couldnt live without me.. ..but, you could kill your sister. - No. Our relation, our marriageits all a fake. - No. All these years I was deceived.. ..because, it was all a lie. - No. Your whole existence. Its nothing but a lie. - No Kabir. Dont say that. Whats the difference between me and her? We were both the same. Then why didnt you love me? Having the same face doesnt make you the same person. People are always different. Kabir. And like you said no one can replace anyone. Kabir.. Kabir.. That moment, that daythat year. All the time that we spent together. Dont they have any importance? Every time you said you love me. Isnt that worth anything? Say it, Kabir. - No. Its worth nothing. Because I always loved Sanjana. Even when I was close to you, I wasnt with you. And you knew it. That you had taken Sanjanas place. Not yours. Fine, then give me my place. Forget her, and accept me. This locket. Adorn this locket to me, like you did to Sanjana. Do it. - Anjana. Do it, please. - Anjana. Theres place for only one person in the heart. And no one else can take it. Nor the moments togetheror the nuptial rounds. PleaseKabir. Just let it go. Becausethisand me Kabir. belong to someone else. Kabir! Kabir! You cant leave. You cant leave. I wont let you go. I wont let you go. Say you love me. Say you love me. Say you love me! Say you love me! Say you love me, Kabir. Say you love me! Sanjana! Sanjana. You never knew how much I loved you. If you cant be mine.. ..then, you can be no ones. You cant be anybody elses! Kabir! Kabir! - Sanjana! Sanjana! Come on.. I conveyed my feelings.. ..through my eyes to you. You gestured your love.. ..and I unhooked my tresses. Touch meslowly-slowly feel me. Dont tease me anymore.. ..I can take it no more. I just want tofeel your body. Touch my body. Dont be shy my honey. Feel my body. I just want tofeel your body. Touch my body. Dont be shy my honey.
