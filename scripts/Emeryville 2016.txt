Must of aged 10 years in just a matter of minutes. - Mr. Gisbourne's computer. The vault guardian himself. - Okay, well to his credit, it took over 87 seconds to crack the vault. You know what's the longest it's ever taken me? - You know there's an official term for this, right? It's called hacking. - It's also called living on the edge. - You know you could go to jail for that. - Not until your caught. And just for the record, our great nation was built by curious minds. - Well, wasn't is curiosity that killed the cat? - That, only applies to small minds. You okay? You know I worry about you. - You don't have to. - Yeah, I do. You're my girl. - Feels like I'm going crazy. Think it'll come back? - I think that one day you'll figure it out. - It's been three years. - Jesus, haven't we been through this? I'm sorry I didn't mean it. - I guess sensitivity isn't something you can acquire. - Sensitivity? You know let me think. I know someone, a super good kid on prom night. What was his name? Oh yeah, Billy. Poor little Billy. - I was sick. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You asked bill Grotowski to prom? - It was middle school. - Wait he didn't know that? - You're such a jerk, Cole. - I'm so sorry. I thought everybody knew about it. - Great, that makes me feel real good. - Are you mad? - Yes, I am. - How mad is my baby? - I'm pissed mad. - I like it when you get mad. - Could you stop? You know this doesn't look like a road anymore, are you sure we're going the right way? - Yes, the GPS says two miles. - It's been saying that for the past 20 miles. - No, it hasn't. - Here, try that. - Are you kidding me? - Go ahead. - Same thing, two miles. - Well it would help if you held the map straight. - I am holding it straight. - Give it to me. - Hey! - You guys are already acting like a married couple. - Look out! - Whoa! - You okay? - Did, did we kill him? - I'm really sorry man. I'm really sorry. - Are you okay? Go get water! Water, now! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Are you okay? - If my mother saw this she'd be very upset. - Your mother should have warned you about those blind spots. Well, this is Reagan, Christie, and Cole. And you've met Justin. - Ethan. - You okay? - I think so. - It just, I mean, we got lost, and, Justin was Tryna, - uh, no worries. No harm done. - Well what the hell are you doing in the middle of nowhere? - On my way to the next town. - May, maybe you can help us get there? - Check the car. - Well? Are we screwed? - Yep. We're screwed. - Alright. Call for some help. - Not happening. - We've been driving for what, 30, 40 minutes? - Yeah. - When's the last time someone saw a car pass by? - Not me. - Well, shoulda stayed with the highway. - GPS showed this was the shortest way. I was Tryna cut the distance. - Cut the distance? Doesn't look like we did that now, does it? - Oh Jesus guys, not right now. Let's just try to stay positive. Does anyone have any ideas? - Well, it's a long way back to the road. - Guess that's good for starters. Any other ideas? - We could start walking. Find our way to the highway? - Do you even know how far the highway is? - Uh, yeah. The GPS said two miles. - Right, the GPS, two miles. - Oh you're map said the same exact thing. - My map? - We just looked at it. - You have no idea how far the highway is, okay? It could be, - it could be way farther. - Yeah, it just said, - all I'm saying is if, - two miles. - Just wait here for two hours. - No way. - Or we walk for a mile, to go find help. In Emeryville. - Emeryville? - Emeryville? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second, okay. There's no mention of an Emeryville here. - Maybe it's too small for the map. - Too old to be on the map. But it's worth the shot. - Exactly. I already like the sound of it already. I know. A Marie ville. - Okay, I'm not leaving the road for some ghost town. I just have a bad feeling about this. - Okay, and when was the last time you had a fire in your belly? - Okay you clearly haven't seen wrong turn. If we go in there, we may never get out. - Justin. The world is not out to get you. - Okay, I see what you're trying to do. - I'm not trying to do anything. We just, we need help, and there's people in there that could help us. - Does anybody else think that we shouldn't go in there? - He's right. - Are you kidding me? - See. You should hand out with her more, than just going to those malls all the time. - Okay. Fine, let's just wait it out. - Hey did anyone else just hear that? Come on, we can't just sit around here, and do nothing. - For once, I'm with her. - Okay, how about a show of hands. All those in favor of Emeryville, raise your hand. Do you really think it could get any worse? - There is another option. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, I'm not betting my life at a toss of a coin. - Heads, we go. - I'm not going anywhere. - You just agreed, we all did. - No, I didn't. - It's not a bad idea if somebody just stayed behind, and kept a look out. Alright, let's get outta here. - You okay to walk? - Hey, you guys. - They all died the same day they were born. - Some kind of infantile disease. - Jesus. You don't look too good. - Guys we have to turn back. - We can't. Look around, there's no where else to go. Where are we? - 1898. - There's a reason why it never made the map. - Oh my god, are you okay? - I just, save my baby. - What? - Someone just get a doctor. Jesus, don't just stand there. Jesus. - Is she okay? - Hey wait, no, no, no, I'm not done yet. - You're done. - Hey I'm not done! - Hello? Anybody home? Is there a mechanic around here? Does he talk? - Once dead. The car is turn cut. If a god or, - enough Andy. What can I do for you fellas? - The radiator of our car shot and, we thought, is there a mechanic? - Not within a 20 mile radius. - Safe to assume you guys don't have much car trouble? - We don't. No motor vehicles here. Never had 'em. Don't need 'em. - Can we use that? - That's for emergencies only. That's house rules. - Are there any other payphones around here? - House rules doesn't mean I can't make that call. Who are you calling? - Triple a. - Triple a? - Mechanic. - Guess that can be arranged. Howdy bird. There's some city folks here. Sure would appreciate some help with their car. Guess it'll have to be tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow's too late. - Guess we'll have to look for help elsewhere. - Elsewhere's more than a walk. - You folks wanna stay here. - Not a choice, okay. Sorry, let's go. - Do you know what a pack of hungry coyotes can do to you? - What do you mean? - A few weeks ago, Aaron, our blacksmith's son, wandered off in them woods. Guess curiosity got the best of him. Village folks went looking for him. Took three days before we found Aaron. Or at least what was left of him. - We'll take your offer. - No we won't. - Yes, we will. - You people have made a wise choice. Folks around here call me Smith. - Is there something about this town that we should know? - You think we're crazy? - No, it's not that. It's just, the way everyone looks at us. - Place like ours, outsiders are a rare treat. Hope you folks like pork chops. Trevor here kills, and puts food on our table. I believe you met scar. - Yeah. Sure knows how to treat a lady. - Now Bertha, she woulda hurt herself, if it wasn't for scar. Tell Bertha there'll be four additional mouths to feed tonight. - Five. I'll get Justin. - You guys lived here long? - There is no smoking in the village. - What are you guys afraid of cancer? - We have them rules. Without rules, there's chaos. - It's okay to smile. - Pick 'em up on your way out. - Now we know why they're stuck in the past. You guys go 'head, I'll catch up with you in a few. - Where are you going? - Tune in to some town gossip. - Justin! Justin! - Ah! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Did you find the mechanic? - Barbaric, ain't it? - Guess it was. - What can I do you for? - How 'bout a shave, Nathan. - That ain't my name. - It says it right there. It's quite a place you have here. You hiding from someone? - The government. Hiding from our government. - Well, how long have you been hiding? - You think our government's doing the right thing? - The right thing? - Yeah, the right thing, with those witch hunts. Hoover's FBI. It ain't no secret. McCarthy's got 'em breathing down everyone's neck. - We're talking president Truman? - Hell yeah president Truman. He's given a free run to both McCarthy and hoover. They think they can get away with murder. They hunt you down like rats. They tap your phone, listen to your conversation, they follow you everywhere you go. An honest man can't take dump, without 'em looking up his ass. No privacy! You know what I mean? - How'd they find you? - Huh? - Hoover's FBI. How'd they find you? - They got those device on ya. They hide 'em on your nails. Dude I got back at them sons of bitches. - Never look to town gossip. - Your orders are to retreat. - I repeat, retreat. - All units head out. - Why you still here boy? - We were sent to protect them, sir! - Alright move! We gotta go! - No! - What'd you say soldier? - There are women and children, sir! - Not ours. - Bad dream? - Yeah. - What was it about? - Same thing. - You know uh, dreams have nothing to do with our future. - There's never enough wood. That's quite a job you did on Bertha. - It wasn't much. - You a medicine woman? - You mean a doctor? No, I'm not quite there yet. I mean I volunteer at the children's hospital. Saint chapels. - You like those? - Yeah. All they need is more red. - Dwarfy here aspires to be a painter. Good music's a cure for a crazy mind. - Can we have the dinner please? - Sarah. - Her name is Reagan. - Sarah Blake. - These kids are from the city. - It can't be. - My apologies. Our medicine man, doctor, has not been himself lately. - No worries. - He's been acting odd. - Know what else is odd? Where are all the kids hiding? What did I say something wrong? - That's one thing we don't talk about in Emeryville. Children. - Oh. Guess it's my turn for an apology. - You didn't know son. Now, let's enjoy the music. Someone get that noise out of my head, before I fuck somebody up! - I need some fresh air. - Me too. Something isn't right about this place. - I mean, doesn't this scare you? - There's worse out there. And yes, it does scare me. - You hide yourself pretty well. - Must be in the gene pool. My old man was a poker player. - Was he good? - The best in paradise, Pennsylvania. Problem is, that's just about the only thing he was good at. - When'd you see him last? - He was at my fourth birthday. Got me that chocolate chip ice cream cake, from Robinson's, with a cherry on top. - You still remember. - And a million other things. - Must be hard on you guys. With him leaving and all. - Mom said it was better that way. The town got to him. - Is that why you chose the army? - It wasn't much of a choice. - And now you're headed back? - There's someone waiting for me. - She must be worth it. - Yep. She is. It's my mom. She's dying. What about you? You and Cole, how'd you guys meet? I'm sorry, you don't have to answer that. - No, I want to. Cole found me, took care of me. - Found you? - There was this accident, about three years ago. Last thing I remember was waking up in the hospital, without a past. - What about your family? - If there was one. No one filed a missing persons report. - Is that why you get those? - What nosebleeds? No, no. Deja vus. I guess a few of them are too strong for my mind. - Sometimes it's not such a bad thing to forget. What? - Have you noticed something? We've got so much in common, and yet we're so far apart. - How's that? - Our past. Except you run from yours, and all I got are Deja vus. - What is it? - These tracks. They're not more than a few days old. - And? - Smith said there's no vehicles. - Where the hell have you been? - Getting some air. - Uh, with him? - Yes, with him. - Okay, what'd you talk about? - Cole, nothing that concerns you. - Did he tell you he was dishonorably discharged from the army? - You went through his stuff? - Did he, huh? His dark fucking secrets. - It's none of your business. - Aw man, you know it became my business, the moment you took my girl out for a walk. He's a coward, that's why. He probably got people killed. - It wasn't like that. - You know, I bet it was worse. - Come on! You guys. We're in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by weirdos. If y'all can't be friends, can we just pretend to get along? - She makes a good point. - Wasn't like that. - Where are you going? - To get some air. Are you coming? - It's kinda getting late to be out there. - You know she's right man, you should just stay behind. - No, no, wait, wait, I'll go. It'll be okay. - It's time for a town haul. Get the doctor. - You guys serious? - Yeah, yeah man. I'm feeling those vibes. She's the one. - You guys make a great couple. You love her, she clearly loves you back. - Yeah, sometimes it's a bit too much. - Do you know how it feels when you're in love with someone and you feel nothing back? You don't wanna know. Every time you gaze into their eyes, a part of you dies. I've been dying for three years now. There's no such thing as too much love. Justin, Justin! Did you hear that? Justin! Hello? Are you okay? - The baby. They killed my baby. - You're not making any sense. You need to rest. - No rest without the baby. - Where is everyone? - Praying, for someone to help us save the babies. - It won't work. - What's the worst that can happen? - They could die. Just like the last ones, and the ones before. - It's called evolution. You taught us that. - I did? - Our legacy, it must continue. - Legacy? You call this a legacy? We're stuck here, without a past, and no future. - You say we let 'em go? - Yes, we let 'em go. - So they can come back? With people, with cameras. - They'll never find us. - They found us the first time. We got lucky once, with that little friend of yours. We live by the rules, we survive by the rules. And the first rule is? - No one leaves. - No one leaves. They have a better chance with you. - And what about the second rule? We'll keep the ones we need. - The medicine woman. She dreamed with the children. - She won't remember. - If not her medicine, her compassion we can use. Perhaps we can make a deal. - Deal? - We tell you your name, and where you come from. - That would be nice. - If you pray god will listen. You just have to pray hard. - No. - You're our only hope! - Justin! Justin! Let me in! Open the door! - Christie? - Did she say anything? - She said something about some sounds. - But nothing else? - No. - You know Christie and how impulsive she is. She probably just went for a walk. - Yeah, she's impulsive, but not stupid. We need to go out there. We need to find her. - And start where? - I don't know. I don't know, - no, I think it's best if we just wait for her. - What if it was Reagen, huh? - You're overreacting. - Hell yeah I'm overreacting. I'm surprised you're not. Where the fuck have you, been? - They keep the ones they need. - Pumpkin? Pumpkin, what's wrong? Hey, hey, hey, are you okay? Hey pumpkin, hey it's me. Say something, say anything. Come on you're scaring the shit out of me. - Is she okay? - I don't know. Come on, say something. I don't care what you guys think, but that's not Christie. Did you hear how she sounded? It's like she was possessed. Something happened to her out there. Someone did that to her. - Where are you going? - To get some answers. - From whom? - I'll start with Smith. - And how do you expect to get them? - Well Mr. Wesson could be pretty persuasive. - Where did you get that? - Does it matter? Move. - Cole. - Open up. Open up you motherfucker! I know you're in there! - Ain't it too late for you city folks? - What happened to Christie? - Something wrong with her? - I don't know, I was hoping you'd tell me. She goes for a walk in the village. Next thing you know she comes back like one of you people. - Village after dark can become a dangerous place. - I need that. - Like I said, house rules. - I'm sure we can move around them rules, can't we? - How many bullets you got in there? - I got enough to get me to that phone. - You sure about that? I hope your friend feels better. - We need to get out of here. - Can't we just wait until morning? I mean it's only a few hours before, - a few hour before we're either dead, or we turn into one of them. - What if we just locked ourselves in here? - Look, you guys were right. You and Reagen both. We shouldn't be here. But man it's too late. What I saw out there is evil. And it's sooner or later before it comes looking for us. - But if that's the case, I mean aren't we safer locked in here? I mean, come dawn we can just catch a ride with the mechanic. - If there really is one. - What do you mean, we all heard him on the phone. - We heard his side of the conversation. - Cole, I'm not leaving her. - Who's with me? - What about Christie? - We'll come back for her. - No, Cole, I'm not leaving her. - Yeah, well what if they kill her. - If they wanted her dead, we wouldn't be having this argument. - We made a pact. Friends don't leave friends behind. - We were kids. We were stuck in the tree house. - We made that promise. You, made that promise. - Yeah, you're right. - There is one other option. One of goes to find help. - It's another one of your brilliant ideas. - No, no, let's hear him out. - Earlier, when we were out there, we saw tire tracks, right? And I'm telling you, those tracks were not more than a couple days old. - Yeah, and what's your point? - There's gotta be a vehicle somewhere. - Talk about some crazy idea. You know, and even if there is some escape vehicle out there, how are we gonna find it? - We follow the tracks. - We follow the tracks? In the middle of the night? - We have these. - Yeah, and you also have an entire fucking village watching you! - I'm not sure there's much of a choice here. - I can't leave Christie. - Tails, you leave. - It's my turn. - How do we know you'll come back? - I'm afraid you'll just have to take that chance. - You know the rules. Without rules, there is chaos. - Leave us alone! - Others? - Not very far. - They can't all be the same. There has to be an odd one out. - What you mean like, someone with an ounce of sanity left? - Yeah. - Like a minority would work. - Where do you think you're going? - In search of sanity. - I thought you'd never come. - There's so many questions. - There are no answers, I'm afraid. See that? People believe a dream catcher holds destiny to their future. Ironical as it may same, I'm looking for a past. - I don't understand. - For as long as I can remember, which is not a lot, I've been living in this godforsaken place. A few scraps of memories, a flurry of dreams, that's all I got. I was hoping you could help me make sense of it all. - What makes you think that I can? - 'Cause you're always there, in those dreams. - Well what was the last thing that you remember? - Waking up. - How long ago was that? - Uh, I've run out of space. You're gonna have to help me make sense of it all, I'm afraid. - I, uh, okay. Um, um, you got me. You're Kowalski, um, Dr. Kowalski, quiet and compassionate. - Yes. Why would I kill you? - There was an accident. - What is your name? - Reagen, Reagen. - See for a moment, you had me convinced. All I wanted was your manual. Goodbye Sarah Blake. - No! - What happened? We gotta get outta here. We gotta get outta, we gotta get Christie! We gotta get out of here now! - Justin, calm down. We can't get to the house right now. We have to wait for Ethan. And we're still alive. - Being alive doesn't feel so great, now does it? - Man do you remember that party? After senior prom? Making out with those Mckinnie sisters upstairs, and their dad showed up? What was his name again? - Mr. Mckinnie. - Yeah, Mr. Mckinnie. Came hunting after us with that double barrel? - Yeah, yeah I remember. - Do you think that this is any worse? - Nothing could be worse than Mr. Mckinnie staring at us with that double barrel. - Now you wait. Ethan's gonna be driving down that road at any moment. We'll be on our way. - Ethan's not coming back. - You chose to come here! - We made a mistake. We have to deal with it. - Maybe I don't want to deal with it. - Justin wait! - For what? For death? Or to become like one of them? Right now I'm not sure which one is more attractive. If you find Christie, when you find Christie, just tell her something for me, huh? Tell her I found that fire. You tell her I took a stand. - Gonna be a long night. Long and wet. - Do you think Justin will be okay? - I don't know. - Now what? - I don't know. - Come on, Cole. You always find a way. - I'm sorry to disappoint you. - I must look terrible. Ugh. - No, I don't think you've ever looked prettier. - I don't think now's a good time for compliments. - It's never a bad time with you. How long have we been together? - I don't, I don't know. - It'll be three years tomorrow. And there's something I've been meaning to say for a while now, I just, I couldn't find the time. Reagen, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me. And I know, that I'm hopelessly flawed to deserve you. - You've got a good heart Cole. - No, I don't. The truth is, ever since I saw you, I wished you'd never remember your past. - There's gotta be a good reason. - It's just, what if there was someone else? Someone, who cared about you, more than me. I'm just so scared of losing you. - You don't have to worry about that. - How 'bout, as soon as we get out of this place, we can start over again. We can, ya know, go on our first date and everything, what do you think? I'm gonna need therapy after all this is over. - How does greasy Chinese takeout, and a cheap bottle of wine, and a kung-fu movie at the drive-in sound? - Greasy Chinese food, and cheap wine, sounds great. We should call in. How about this week. Uh, oh, phone. - Hm? - We have to get to the saloon, to the phone. - How do you plan on doing that exactly? - Oh god, I don't know. Just give me your phone. - Cole, you know it doesn't work. - It'll work just fine. - Who is it? - It's me, city boy. They found this place. - FBI? - I'm afraid so. - Tracking device. - There's more where this came from. - What do you suggest we do? - Can I come in? - Ethan, is that you? Come on man, it's not the time to be, - no rules, - funny. - There's chaos. - See what I mean. - No. I'm afraid I don't. - Operator. Operator! Ugh! - Look at their hooves. Don't they look funny? You can't see that? Look at it? Look at the hooves! Don't you get it? Whoever's out here! He's been in here! Look! - Get a hold of yourself! - They're out here! Because of hoover! They've been out here! Look at 'em, look at 'em! See how they, - them stray folk put you up to this? - No! I knew, the moment I laid eyes on you, you were with the FBI! Where are you hiding that device? - Shh! - God may never forgive me, for what I've started today. These people may be mentally ill, but they're still human. And no amount of electricity can make them human again. We don't always make the right choices. For all we know, in those moments, are the result of bad memories. Wm3c4 erased declarative memory, while leaving procedural memory alone. In other words, physiologically they remain unchanged, behaviorally however, the subject becomes an empty slate. Wm3c4, is a declarative memory reset button. Three months now, the treatments are going better than I anticipated. Several subjects have started forming new memories. A few have started inventing memories. Their behavioral instability used to be a concern. First success, someone who could actually rationalize, control impulses, separate right from wrong. This one, fit for the real world. Something ain't right. A few of the subjects are continuing to exhibit random aggressive behavior, that's outside the normal patterns. It's rubbing off on others. The in law inside them is, it's contagious. I'm beginning to think you can't tame what's meant to be wild. And it was the first sign of trouble. When Ms. Blake reached her full term. It's a classic reaction, they're like animals and they want me to become one of them. - There was no infantile disease. No one showed 'em how to handle babies. The cries got to them. - What are you talking about? - It doesn't matter anymore. Christie was right. They keep the ones they need, and they don't need us. - Hey, there's a way out. - Yeah, uh, Justin, Justin, Justin, we have to get, Justin, - look at me! Look at me! - Give me your hand. - Can I let go? What? - You came back. - You didn't think I would? - Just for a moment. - Listen, there's still a couple hours 'til daylight. I know it doesn't sound right, but get some sleep. - I'll take you up on that. - Bad dream again? - I left someone behind. Her entire family. - So that why you were dishonorably discharged, leaving 'em behind? - For trying to save them. - Oh my god, Chris! - Come on, we can't stop! - Chris! Chris! Oh my god, Chris! - Her name is Casey. - It's not her name. I don't have time to explain. Chris you have to come with me. - Just come. - Casey will help her family. Raise children, our legacy. - You're not her family. - Oh yes, but we are. - Casey, tell her who's your family. - This is my family. - Hey. Come on, come on, come on. We gotta go. Come on, we gotta go. Go, go, go! - How much more? - Come on, come on. Get in. - Okay. - Get in. - We're not getting outta here. What, what? What? - You drove a stick before? - Come on get inside. - We both won't make it. Not with the stuck gearbox. I'll lead 'em away. - No, I'm not leaving without you. - There's not much of a choice here. - What about your mom? She's been there before. Fair enough. Tails, I leave. Heads you go. - I'm coming back for you. - Don't. - Remember what you said last night. How I fight to forget, and all you have are Deja vus. Well guess what? I'm tired of fighting. Now go. Before I change my mind. - You're dead wrong about your dad. He wasn't the best poker player in town. Poker face. There's never enough wood. There you go, good. - I'm gonna go ahead and start flowing. - You can stop. You can stop. I don't know where the coin is. - You are rolling? - Forget the sun, I don't need the sun. Let's just go. - Yep. - Yep. - Okay. Action. - Alright that is a wrap for the night. - That's a wrap? - That's a wrap.
