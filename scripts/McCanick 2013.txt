Otherwise, breezy and nice with a high of about 80. 6:30 a.M. Let's get a look at the traffic. Steve, what's happening? It's a little bit of a nightmare around Philadelphia this morning, with a backup on 95 north starting around the Walt Whitman bridge, going back five to six Miles. Road construction slowing things up there. An overturned tractor-trailer on the schuylkill by the Conshohocken curve westbound. That's starting to be cleared. Other than that, everything's looking pretty good. And mass transit's running on time. All right, thanks, Steve. Let's get a look at sports. The Phillies take on Pittsburgh at citizens bank park tonight in the first game of a three-game series. The pirates coming off a tough loss against St. Louis on Saturday, as the phills look to extend their five-game winning streak at home. Game time is... Morning. Hey. H... Morning. How you doing, Julius? Thanks for the rush job. That Harris tweed's very fine. Yeah, Jenny, she's the one. She got that for me. Let me... I put it in. Okay. Thank you. Here you go, buddy.

How'd you get this? I'm arresting. There's an order for notification. He's been out three months. You knew about this? Sit down. Did you fucking know about this? Sit down, for Christ's sake. Look. His behavior at Graterford was totally clean. So they let him off with the minimum. Okay? To tell you the truth, I was hoping you wouldn't find out. You need to leave this alone, Mack. What's your problem? What's my problem? Jesus Christ. you're lucky you didn't lose your job over this. I need to know that we understand each other. You reopen this can, And the shit flies all over again. We're friends. Wai... we're friends, but I'm also your captain, And I'm giving you an order. You are not to make contact with Simon Weeks. Is that understood? Captain, the state attorney's guy is here. I'll be right out. Mack, is it understood? All right. Yeah? Yes, yes. Yes. Okay, good. I saw your brother at the captain's dinner last night. Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know he's an asshole, but he told me that Chris is getting oriented. They put him on the street Monday.

Yeah, must've found somebody he liked better. They shop around, you know. Okay, who was it? Who was it? Raven. Raven. Is that his first or his last? Man, Raven's not his real name. It's a tag. I don't know his real name. Okay, I see. Do you know how often Raven And congressman Langley got together? If you had to guess? If I had to guess? Yeah, if you had to guess. Probably three or four nights a week. They'd go off some place together. Three or four nights a week. Where? Hotel? Raven wouldn't say. All right? Raven always kept pretty quiet about Joe. Joe. Joe, huh? Yeah, Joe. Raven's crazy. Nobody fucks with him. Would you think that Raven could've killed congressman Langley? I don't fucking know.

Sometimes you just... You gotta let go. How so? I never wanted this for him. None of it. He just got sucked into my old man's bullshit. All he cared about was the fuckin' bars. "You need to get bars!" You ain't worth shit without any. There may not be bars on my chest, but I have done things on this job. I booked more multiples my first year in homicide than any... Any detective in the department. And that... Fuckin' means somethin'. Absolutely. But... it don't matter. If Chris wants that, let him have it. It's his life, not mine. I was not a good father. And I owe him. But... I'm gonna make it right with him, because there's still time. I can show him what kind of father I can be. Startin' tonight. Well, Mack, that's... that's... That's admirable.

For you. Thanks, baby. Mack. What the fuck are you doing here?! I told you to watch out. I've been trying to call you. Get the fuck down there. I've been trying to call you. What the fuck is going on, man? What the fuck are you doing? I just checked Gubb. He is a she, by the way. And she is in the back of the car. Well, what the fuck is she doing in the fuckin' back of the car?! What about my fuckin' suit? Do you know Simon Weeks? Right. Do you know anything about a murdered congressman? Fuck! Right.

Detective McCanick, I'm sergeant Ainsley, the 5th. You okay? Quinn's five minutes out. Your partner's en route to Roxborough memorial. Everything we can for him. He's pretty bad. But that guy you shot? Jonathan Papas. A piece of shit. You did us all a favor today. Well... you know I gotta ask. See who shot your partner? Anything you can give me, detective? Simon... Weeks. I'm sorry. One more time? Weeks. Simon Weeks. All right. Like I said, we're gonna take care of this. You just sit tight. Dispatch, it's Ainsley. I'd like you to run a name for me. Yes, this is, uh, this is detective Eugene McCanick. I'm calling about the status of another officer. Floyd Intrator. You just cost me 50 bucks. You ever think about getting a real job? I got a job. A-And I make really good money when asshole cops don't fuck it up. My mistake. Yeah. Yeah. We found your boy. Raven's name is Peter Curtner. He's from Queens, New York. Is he okay? I don't know. He disappeared the same day that Langley was shot. Look, nobody out here seems to know anything about Raven or Langley besides you. I need you to think. If there is anything, anything at all, anything you didn't tell us, anything that you forgot. Friends? That Raven might have mentioned? Places that he wanted to go? Anything. When's the last time you ate? I eat. Not some crap. Real food. Get in the back. I'll buy you breakfast. Go on. Get in the back. Come on. All units advised to be on the lookout for detective Eugene McCanick, last seen wearing a long-sleeved, blue pullover shirt and blue jeans. Detective McCanick is... Louis! Hey. Hey. Why you runnin', Louis? 'Cause you're chasin' me, man. just want to talk, Louis. Louis. Weeks... you said that he was clean. He is! Are you scared of him? Is that it? No, man. He's... He's... He's good people! He is a fucking... scumbag... hustler. No, He's... He's helping kids out now, man! They, like, look up to him and shit. Get the fuck...! He's a fuckin' killer. He's a fuckin' killer! No. No. What the fuck is he doing back here? He's helping kids get off the street now, man. Helping 'em? How's he fuckin' helping them? I don't know! It's... he fuckin' set it up with his old school! School? What school? Go tell it on the Mountain? Over the hills and everywhere go tell it on the Mountain take it easy. Doesn't your mother feed you? I don't have a mother. Your father, then. I'm by myself. Where do you live? I get by. Did you ever know your parents? Nope. Well, who took care of you? Alice. She... Whoever Alice was... Bet she's worried about you. So... Langley. You said that you saw him a few times. Was that the same time that Raven was seein' him, or... I'm not gay, you know. Uh... I don't care. I just do this 'cause it's easy. I don't like it or anything. Okay, okay. So, you got a family? Yeah, a wife. Any kids? I have a son. Yeah, I thought so. Bet you're a good dad. Nice! Need a break? All right. Get outta here. Take five, get a cookie, get some juice... No pushing, no pushing, no pushing. Hey. Come on, come on, come on. Let's go! Sounded pretty good. Thanks. you're Alice? Yes. I'm detective McCanick. I remember you. The trial. That's right. I'm lookin' for Simon. I understand that he's running a program out of your place. helpin' children, or somethin'. you're mistaken. I don't know where Simon is. you're aware he's been paroled? I wasn't. Obviously, you knew. Or you would have said, "I haven't seen him. He is still in prison." I heard he was released. So you know where he's staying? What do you want with him? He paid his debt. Isn't that enough? He killed a cop today. What? He killed... Ah, I heard you. Simon was brought to us at six. His mother had been institutionalized. When he was 15, I caught Simon dealing pot to some of the other boys. He ran away. Rumors started. He was livin' on the streets, selling himself. I even went out lookin' for him once. Then they called to say that he'd been arrested. That he had shot a man in a hotel. I know Simon. He's done bad things. But he is not a killer. You don't him as well as you think. The guy that he shot? He was a John. He was a creep. Well, maybe... Maybe he roughed up Simon. Maybe he said the wrong thing. If there was a boy in that situation like you're talking about, that kind of boy... They could lose control. He killed Joe Langley. He killed a cop today. I don't believe it. He killed... A cop. He killed my partner. "Each day out here, "I feel better. Like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be." "I think my birthday "may finally be a happy day..." "JoJo. "Feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to..." "Lord, let me accept the things that..." "A cheesecake. I had cheesecake for breakfast." Aah! No, I am not, I am not gonna hit our son, all right? I'm not gonna hit him. That's just paranoid bullshit. Because I'm angry. That's why. You think I don't see what he's doin'? Huh? He doesn't wanna be a cop. He's just doin' it to piss me off. And you think I'm gonna let him throw his life away with that bullshit. you're out of your fuckin' mind... will you stop fuckin' yellin' at me? just stop yellin'. You... hello? Hello? God. Oh, you motherfucker. hey, hey, hey, what the fuck? Stay in the car. hey, what the fuck, man? Let me go! you're supposed to get in the car. Let me go. What the fuck, dude? Come on. just get in the car. Let me go! Fuck! hey! Like fucking little boys, huh?! You like fucking little boys! Suck on that, you fucker! Suck on that, you fucking sick son of a bitch! Fucker! What do you want? I just wanna talk. Hold on. Okay. Go to 18th and morse. It's all bombed out. There's a brownstone. I'll be there. I said get the fuck outta here. I said get the fuck outta here! Get outta here. Get down! Shut the fuck up! Where the hell is Simon Weeks? Where the fuck is Simon Weeks? What? You gonna shoot me? Go ahead, motherfucker, and shoot me! I'm a fuckin' Philadelphia police officer. Where's Simon Weeks? Where the fuck... Drop those motherfuckin' guns! Get the hell down. Get on your fucking knees! Get down here. Get the fuck over there! All right, you. Where the fuck is Simon Weeks? Who? Where the fuck is Simon Weeks? I don't know... Go! The fuck you think you are? The fuck you get off? Huh? Fuck you. No, fuck you. You stupid fuckin' moron. Who the fuck told you to come bust this place up by your fucking self?! What are you? Fucking popeye Doyle?! I put out an a.P.B. On you this morning. You know how that looks? A captain putting out an a.P.B. On his own detective? You know how many calls I've gotten? I didn't know it was an undercover op. Fuck the op! I don't give a shit about the op. So, what then? Jesus! Right, Floyd took a shot in the chest this morning! And you told Ainsley it was Weeks. What the fuck happened?! Uh... listen, I, uh... What happened, Mack? Jerry... I just wanted to talk to him. I just wanted to make sure that he wasn't planning something. His partner... he, he just, he fuckin' blindsided me. And Weeks went crazy. I... I... Yeah, Weeks shot Floyd. Yeah. He shot him, Jerry. Jesus. What happened seven years ago was one thing. Right? You were in the middle of it all, with your marriage and Chris and everything. And you took it out on your case. It happens. And I could either let you go down or put some junkie kid in jail, who'd probably be dead in a year anyway, right? But this isn't some junkie! Cop gets shot, it doesn't go away. The department asks questions. They don't stop till they got the right answers. Do you know how lucky you are that that kid kept quiet all that time? I tell you to leave it in the dark, and here you come And shine a bright fuckin' light on it! Somebody finds out what we did to that kid, it's not just you that goes down! It's me, it's Bronson, howeth, gage. The whole fuckin' crew! I know. And then we go down, And we do time with ten thousand scumbags that we put away. Do you understand that?! Yes, yes. Yeah. Now, this is what's gonna happen. you're gonna go down to the hospital. you're gonna see your partner. Then you're gonna go home, And you're gonna stay there. And that's it. No more Weeks! No more nothin'! Floyd, then home. Is that clear?! What about my dinner with Chris? I'm gonna have to take your gun. The gun, Mack. Floyd gonna make it? Hmm. Pray he does. Ballistics come back in the morning. It'd better be what you say, Mack. Eugene! Hi. This is detective Chris McCanick. I officially start on Monday, but leave a message, And I'll get back to you. Thanks. Uh, Chris. It's, uh, it's dad. I, um... I, uh, I just, I want to, um. I just wanted to call and say thanks for seeing me tonight. I got the restaurant all worked out. It's gonna be real classy. We'll just have a nice meal, maybe a couple drinks. Treat ourselves. And, uh, it's not a big deal. I just, it's just to, just to start to get to know each other again. just nice. And also... Um... Ah, I just, I want to say that... People are gonna start to say some things about me, And it's not true. All right? Uh... So don't let them get you worried. And it's just... Everything got all fucked up. Aw, it doesn't matter. Forget all that. I just want to tell you. I just want, uh, I mean I just, I w-want you to hear this from me! All right. I just want you to hear this from me. No matter what happens, I want you to know that I'm proud of you. All right? And I know that, back in the day, I said some things, And... I treated you bad, not like a father should. I just... That's over now. And whatever, uh, whatever you do with your life, it's okay with me. Uh, so no matter what happens, I'll always want you to remember... That... that I'm your father. And you're my son. And nothin' anybody says can make that go away. What do you want from me? just let it go. Gene. Wow, um, come in. I guess. Want a towel or something? I found Raven. What? Is he okay? He's dead. Wait... what? They found him in a motel. In Jersey, with his wrists cut. He's in the morgue as a John Doe. I'm sorry. Listen. Maybe we should, um... Maybe we should think about this. Maybe Raven didn't kill Joe Langley. Um, see... We never considered that. Fact is, it could have been anyone. He's dead. I know, I know. And maybe... Maybe we've been hasty. You know? There are a hundred options. I... we, you know, we... we should... We should... We should keep working on this. I just... I just wanna make sure we get the right person. Look. Raven, he's dead. There's nothing I can do about him. But... but I can help you. You don't need to live like this. You could stay with me. No! Goddamn it! Stay? What do you mean, "stay"? I just mean, you know... I got a small apartment here in the city. And, uh, you know, a lot of cops keep 'em. I'm stayin' there right now. You could... You could move in for a while. You know, just... uh, just till, till you get your feet back under you. And it's not a... It's not a big deal! You know? It's just, uh, you know, it's a nice place. And small. But it's nice. It's just nice. I could live there? If ya wanted. With you? Yeah. You don't really want me to live... No, it could work out. It could work out. Well, what about your wife?

No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. No, just... just stop. All right? just stop. just let it happen. Jesus Christ. How long were you cruising me for before you picked me up? What? How long was it? Two Weeks? Or... or maybe a month? Do you actually think I would wanna fucking live with you? Hmm? I just, I thought... You know, you... you old closet cases are all the same. You finally figure out who gets your rocks off, And you think it's love. Shut up. What is it? What, uh, do I look like your... Like your best friend from high school? Shut your mouth. Hmm?
