Jesus, God, look at you. - There you go, sweetheart. All right? - Thank you. Thanks very much. Here y'are. Get that down you. Thanks. So, what you gonna do? I don't know. I've got nowhere to go... nothing at all, no bag, no money, no clothes... nothing. Won't it be better going back home? I hated it. I've got nothing at all. What about your pals? They're not me real mates, they're just people I know. Useless waste of space, like me. Don't think like that. Well, it's true. Can you do me a favour, please? Can you lend me some money? I'll buy you a train ticket. What about if I pretended it was for a train ticket? You've got some cheek. Here's a tenner. Thank you. I've gotta go, I've got a meeting. - OK. - Are you gonna be all right? - Yeah. - OK. - See you again. - You take care. Who are you? Don't matter. It's my photograph. Who's she? It's not your business. She's pretty fit. Is she a model? - What? - I said she's quite fit, is she a model? No. So you do things for magazines like pornos and... sex magazines? No! I'm only asking. You should do. She should get in 'em. Give them to me. Oi, you lads, cut it out. We was only messing about. We're best mates. Yeah, all right, well, just calm down, all right? Yeah. Get back. Get back, else I'll drop 'em. - Give me them back. - No. I just wanted to look. If you want my watch... ..here you are. And bag. I don't want your bag and watch, mate, I just wanted to look. I was only messing about. Here. Who's she? She? Maria. Maria? - Pretty fit. - She is. Yeah. Where's she from? France, Paris. So where are you from? - Me? - Yeah. - From Poland. - Oi! What you doing? You know it's private here? Yeah, we do. Clear off, then, or I'll call the police. - Shut up! - I'll get the police. Clear off! - Bye. - Hold on, man. Oi, wait! Oh, my God, you look big! - Hey, that's enough of that. - Shut up! - I'll remember your face. - Yeah, whatever! - Got a photographic memory. - Yeah. So, what happened to your face? I got beat up last night by three lads, down there. They nicked my bag and everything. Where do you live? Erm, everywhere. Anywhere. Just around here. On the streets too? Mm. Where do you live? In there, with my father. Which one do you live in? I'll come and call for you tomorrow. I show you later. What, d'you want me to come with you to see your flat or your house? I don't know. If you want. Yeah? What, your dad won't mind, will he? What, he will mind or will he let me? I don't know. What's his name? - Dad's name? - Yeah. Mariusz. Cool. What's your name? Oh, I'm Marek. - Tomo. Nice to meet you, mate. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, Graham. - How you doing, Marek? - I'm OK, thank you. - Nice to see you, mate. Who's your sidekick, then? - He's my friend, Tomo. - Tomo. All right, Tomo? - All right. - Where you from, then? - Erm, Nottingham. - Up North, eh? Yeah, well, Midlands. Midlands? What bit of the Midlands is that? - East. East Midlands. - East, oh! Thanks for helping us yesterday. I see you're wearing the shirt. Nice one, son. What you doing later on this afternoon? D'you wanna earn a fiver? Yeah. Well, I was asking Marek actually, Tomo, to tell you the truth. Erm, basically, what it is, tomorrow, I want you to sit down on a deckchair, with a big pile of deckchairs by you... - Yeah. ...and when someone comes along and they want to hire a deckchair, you have to stand up, just for a couple of seconds, take the money and sit back down again. Sound easy enough? - Yeah. - Yeah? Can I do it as well? Will you vouch for him? Is he an 'ard worker? Yeah. - Yeah? - I think so. OK, five pound each. Is that all right, is that a deal? - Yeah, yeah. - There's one little catch. See this lot of deckchairs we've got 'ere, and these ones lined up over 'ere, we gotta sand them down today, so no one gets splinters. So, if you wanna pick up the sandpaper and get going on it, son. So, do we get a fiver for this and a fiver for tomorrow? - That's a tenner. - He's a joker, in't he? No, five pound, that's it. And you gotta prove yourself to me first, d'you understand? - OK. - Yeah? All right, go on. No, no, no, no, Tomo, not that one, son. Look, one of them over there. Pick one up. You gotta start your own chair, go on. Get a spurt on, Have we gotta do 'em all? Yeah, all of 'em, yeah. There ain't that many of 'em. The sooner you get a start on it, the sooner we'll do it. I know that he's an 'ard worker. There you go. Tomo? Tomo, wake up. Maria. Your food. There ain't a lot there, mate. There's only a little bit. I can't give you more. The rest is for my dad. How much is your dad having? Eat. So, erm, why have you got so many pictures of Maria? Is she your girlfriend, or summat? Yes, she is. So... have you had sex with her? No. Only felt the bazookas? No! Well, obviously, her being your girlfriend, you've kissed her, yeah? Not yet. Look, mate, in England, it's sort of like a tradition for like a... girlfriend to kiss her boyfriend, so, it sounds to me like you're not actually with her, you just like her. In Poland, we mustn't kiss to be together, and you think only about one thing. But, mate, we're not in Poland. This is England and so... it sounds to me like she's not your girlfriend. So, I'm gonna try and get in there with her, so, when I get with her, I'm not gonna be that comfortable with you having pictures of my girlfriend, so, d'you wanna give me them now or... No, door closed. You must go and find another girl. She's my girlfriend. And eat fast, I must meet my dad. Why can't I stay here? You can't stay, you must eat and go out. Where am I gonna go, mate? I don't know. So, you're just gonna let me out on the street again? Please, I'm not gonna nick owt. Tomo, it's me. Wake up. Are you hungry? Eat. - What's that? - Sausage, Polish. Kielbasa. Mate, I can't eat no more foreign food. - Why? - Half my insides are burning. I need a poo really bad. It's all the spiciness and that. I need the toilet. No, you can't have toilet. My father is drunk, he will kill you. Mate, it's important. Wait, I have good idea. - I need to go. - Wait! I give you plastic bag from kitchen. You do it in, then we throw it in the window. What, here? - What? - Here? Yeah. Is there no way I can go to the toilet, please? - No. - What about toilet roll? - Only plastic bag. - What about what can I wipe my bum with? - Please, mate. - No. Will you get me some toilet roll on the way, then? Wait, I give you plastic bag. Wait. Don't forget toilet roll, please. Wait. OK. Please... hurry up. - Don't forget toilet roll. - OK! She's so fit, man. She's loads better than she looks on the pictures. What d'you think she's talking about now? Oi! - Oi! - What? - I said, what d'you think she's talking about? - I don't know. Probably France. I'd love to just take her out for a meal, and just be with her and hold her and just eat together and... maybe she'll feed me and she'll be saying at the end of the night, "Ooh, Thomasy, I love you so much. "I want to feed you grapes and feed you bread and cheese..." - Shut up. - Hello. - Hi. - How are you today? Hi. What happened to your face? I just got into a fight with three lads. - Really? - Yeah. Does it hurt, sweetie? - Nah. - Sure? Yeah, yeah. If you think that's bad, you should see the state of them. - I dominated all three of 'em. - Just be careful, yeah? Yeah, cool. - How are you, Marek? - I am fine. - Yeah? - Thank you. And you? I'm fine, thank you. How did your pictures go? - Very good. - Yeah? - You have to show them to me sometime. - Of course. So, do you like photography, arts and writing and things? - Yeah, I do, actually. - Cool, I'm actually a painter myself. - Really? - Yeah, I do everything. I do... glasses, wine bottles... ...anything. - Really? - You name something, - I'll tell you if I've done it. - Erm, a flower. Yeah, I've done flowers, I've done fruit, cakes. I do women sometimes. I actually did, like... It weren't awesome but it was an OK drawing of the Eiffel Tower. - The Eiffel Tower? - Yeah, yeah. - Show it to me. - Yeah, of course I will. Maybe I should do you sometime. Maybe. - Definitely. - Do you want something to drink? - Lemonade, please. - Lemonade. And you? I'm gonna stay off the fizzies, I reckon. Can I just have a...a still water, please? - No ice. - OK. Cheers. You're not a painter. She's so fit... I am. I am! - No! - I've got loads of paintings, loads! - Show me one. - Well, I ain't got my bag, have l? - Mm-hm. - Hm. Of course. Oh, come on, someone sit down. We've been sat around for four and a half hours! Oh, come on, it's getting cold now, - can we not just call it a day? - No, it's not! Can we not just call it a day? - No. - Tomo, shut up, please! You shut up. Right. So you're saying the guy who dropped it off has definitely gone, he's not here? Yeah. So, which way did he go? That way. So, he went that way, we'll go that way, yeah? - OK. - So, I'm just gonna go in, cool, natural, and just be myself, and I'll just pick it up and... Just watch and learn, learn from the master. Don't worry about it, I'll pull it off. Shall I go with you, master? What for? I can fake heart attack or something like this. What d'you want to fake an 'eart attack for? If you just do it the way I'm gonna do it, then it'll...it'll...it'll happen. It's just... It's just me, I can do everything. So, just stay there a second, just one minute, back in a minute. Don't move. I'm just gonna... just get these for...Uncle Ian. Ian'll get these, these'll get to Ian. Ian. Come on, hurry up. Come on. Ta-da! What's that - grandma's raincoat? What else is in there? A girl's blouse. What else is in there? Trousers. Rupert Bear trousers! No! What else is in there? I want summat decent. That's cool. Like businessman. Mate, you're not a businessman. Take it off, it's not a fashion show. I thought you said the person who dropped the bag off looked like me. Maybe he washes for his grandparents, I don't know. That's nice. Retro trousers. There not retro, they're ridiculous! Mate, just get my tracksuit, please. I'm gonna be stuck in that tracksuit for the rest of my life. Is it dry? Yeah. No, it's not, it's soaked! What the flippin' heck's that? What you done to it? I don't know, not me. You've wrecked my clothes, my only bits of clothes! A pen! For God's sake! Maybe this one? Mate, it's a dress! Put it in your trousers. Why are you being stupid? Why are you finding this funny that I've got no clothes to wear? God's sake, grow up! Don't be a baby! Come back, Tomo! Marek. - Oi! - What? I've chosen some clothes out the bag. - Show me. - Promise you won't laugh. I won't. Come on, you promised you wouldn't laugh. Sorry. You look great. I think I look like a female golfer. No! No. Honestly, you look fine. - What's that? - What? - What? - That. - Yeah? - It's a wheelchair. Yeah, it is. - Whose do you reckon that is? - I don't know. Don't look like anyone's. - Shall we go get it? - OK. I'll race you down. Come on, quick! So, d'you think she'll like it all, then? Of course, it's flowers, umbrella and bell, everything. Don't worry. I just don't want to serve him. All right, listen, I'll say something, but just, you know, accept the fact, he's a bloody idiot. Oh, God, talking of idiots. - Go on. - I'll see you. All right, sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Let me change the sign for you. Thanks. - Hello. - I had a car crash. - No, you haven't. - No, you're right, I haven't. What's this? A special taxi for you. - No, really? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, door-to-door service. But I live really far away. - It doesn't matter. - We don't care. Come on, in. Thank you very much, my darlings. I feel very honoured. - So, which way? - This way. OK. - Let's go. - Go, go, go! You boys are crazy. # Are you a gambler? # You gonna take a chance on this life? # Are you a strangler? # Are you gonna kill it all? # Are your friends and your lovers, your God-fearing brothers all gone? # This is this all you got left # And you don't see it lasting that long # Are you a whirlwind? # Do you suck in everything around you? # Are you a monster? # Do you destroy it all? # Are your friends and your lovers, your God-fearing brothers all gone? # Is this all you got left # And you don't see it lasting that long? # Low, low, low # Low is the man, so hard are the blows # Low, low, low # Low... are the punches # For you # This is where I live. - Yeah, which one? - With the flowers. - Oh. - Up there. Thank you so much for taking me home, boys. Thank you. It's been the best day I've had since I've come to London. It's our pleasure. And I love the way you decorated my chair. Can I have a kiss now, please? And remember, I love you both the same. Bye. See you later. Yeah! See you later. - Bye. Whoo-ha! Tomo, hurry up. - What? - We have no time. What d'you want? - What? - Hurry up. - Why? - My dad will be back soon. Why? Your dad's just gone to work. He only gone to the shop. - Just two minutes. - He will catch you! - Just two minutes. - No, I'm coming. Oh! Tomo, what are doing? I'm lonely. Ow! Hurry up! Hurry up! Who is it? It's Tomo and Marek. - Who? - Tomo and Marek! Hurry up. Oh, what's wrong, boys? What? Do you know what time it is? It's seven o'clock in the morning! - So? - What do you mean, so? This is the middle of the night for me. So, here, we've brought you some stuff. What about that? We brought you some clothes. I don't want none of your stuff! You woke me up at seven o'clock in the morning to bring me this load of old rubbish. Are you mad? We brought you some clothes. Do you want to buy 'em? That's bird's dresses, I don't want that! What would I want that for? You can sell 'em. You can sell it all. - You can sell it all. - Wait a minute. Retro trousers. You can sell 'em all. I'll give you a fiver for the suit. We're selling it all together. - What? - You must buy all. I don't want all of it. All I want is this. Well, you can resell it on the market. So, how much d'you want for all of it? Twenty-five, twenty quid? Twenty-five qui... Why's... Eurgh! Now, piss off and let me get back to bed, you. Seven o'clock in the morning! I don't know what... Vin! Come on! We got everything - bread, wine, grapes, cheese, onions? - Yeah. - Things to sit on. It's gonna be ace, this. So, just let me do all the talking, cos I'm better than you at it. - OK. Hello. - Hello, lads. Where's Maria? I'm afraid she ain't in today. She told us that she was gonna be in. No, she had to go home. One of her family's sick or something. No problem, we go and find her. No, no, lads, not here home, Paris home. - Where? - France. She didn't tell us. - When did she go? - This morning. Don't worry, there'll be another little bird here next week. Not like Maria. What about all these things for her? I...I don't know, I don't care. Do what you want with it. And remember, I love you both the same. Yeah, right! What a crock! It's really annoying that we spent a lot of money on all this food and that. On the cheese and bread and grapes. She didn't even have the decency to tell us she was going. OK, give me a bottle. You've had loads. Please. There's only half a bottle left, I've only had like two swigs. - Please. - Don't have loads, then. Thank you. By the way, have you ever drunk... have you ever drunk before? - No. - You've had like two swigs and you're all over the shop. You don't even know what you're saying. Look at you. What you staring at? You're out of your head. Why did anything good never happen to me? Oh, stop crying and don't be big baby. I'm not crying and I'm not a big baby, am I? It's called love, son. You don't love her more than me. Well, obviously I do! You've got long hair and a stupid accent. You've got stupid clothes. - So? - So. I can just go nick some from a shop. You can't change the way you speak. Anyway, let's not fall out over a girl. How much money have we got? I don't know. Ten pounds. That's all. Just a tenner? OK. Right, then, let's forget about Maria. Get wasted. No! You look like a German! It's mine! Yeah! Ah-ha! Let's turn this up a bit. Whoo! Ah-oo! Three, two, one, go! Ha! Ah-ah! Hoo! He's turned the music off. - Tomo! - Is this your dad? I think so. All right, mate? What? What? Any chance of a trans... What? What? - I don't know who are you. - I'm Tomo. But, but... Please. I want, put on your clothes and leave. - Yeah, mate. - At once. I'll put them on, I'll take myself out. Hey, out! - Please, please! - Out! Out! Oh! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. - Where am I? - Barbados. Cup of tea there. Oh! Do you remember what 'appened last night? It's nice, this. Great cooking. Good. Banging headache. Look, why don't you just go home, son? You're gonna get yourself into all sorts of trouble if you stay down here. - You know that, don't you? - Well, I can't go home and I like it here. What d'you mean, you can't go 'ome? If it's money, I'll lend you the money to get 'ome. It's not money. I've just got nothing to go home to. - What, no 'ome? - No. - No relatives or nothing? - No. Well, look, you can stay 'ere for a bit, right, but you're gonna 'ave to 'elp me out. I mean, when I say "Jump", you're gonna say "How high?" Yeah? Help me out, do whatever I say, whatever I tell you to do. - Yeah? - Yeah. Not in like a sexual way or summat. Sex? No! Sexual way? What you talking about? No, not a sexual way! - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. Hm. OK. Ohh! - Lovely day, innit? - Yeah. Mm. The sun's shining. Look at that station, it's amazing. It's very huge. Massive. Maybe, like one weekend, we could save up some money. Go... Obviously because we're not even two minutes away from the station, just get on the train and just go, for a weekend. Can you imagine that, just us two? OK. If you want, I can ask my dad to get us cheaper tickets. He works there. Really? Cool, definitely. It'd be fun, wouldn't it? It'd just be like a bit of a road trip between me and you. Like, just best mates going to Paris. See the Eiffel Tower, eat croissants, drink red wine, cheese, bread. It'd be good. Just see Maria and just have a laugh with her, Iike we did the other day. I mean, it wouldn't be hard to find her. I mean, she's a beautiful girl. Yeah, she is. Yeah. And she must be popular in Paris. So... I just hope she ain't got a boyfriend. Anyway... I'm gonna get back to the head polishing. Polish. Good old Brasso. Yeah. - What you gonna do? - I am staying here. - You'll stay here? - Yeah. All right, then, mate, well, I'll maybe come down in a bit we'll go over to the park or just... - OK. ...just go out for a bit, yeah? All right, I'll see you in a bit, mate. - See you later. - See you later. # They said the hand of God delivered the blow # But all that I know # It wasn't him that nearly killed you # I let you down, I never carried you home # I left you alone # To fend there for yourself # I see you out sometimes enjoying the square # The mademoiselles # With faces filled with sadness # For all that you gained, you still remember me # When I speak # I'll remember where I'm from # Well, it's a long way back to the Medway # It's a long way back to the school # It's a long way back to the Coliseum # When we had faces too # When we had faces too # Sometimes I go back, but I never stay # Just wasting away # The world that we grew up in # One day you will see me down on the Strand # And when you hear me speak # You'll remember where you're from # # Come on, open up the windows # Yeah, I'm reeling in the heat # You know I wanna hear the planes flying over # You know I wanna hear the street # Seems like we've been here a long year # Living here with bated breath # You've been looking for an angle # And I've been waiting for a death # No, there's only a few of us left # There's only a few of us left # There are only a few of us left # That I remember # Well, we were walking through the old town # And I remember the place # You were checking your reflection # In the shop front's mirrored glass # I saw the glory of a new love # Oh, this pain, this restlessness # Some days I feel better # Oh, and some days I feel less # There's only a few of us left # But, oh, there's only a few of us left # There's only a few of us left # But we got hope #
