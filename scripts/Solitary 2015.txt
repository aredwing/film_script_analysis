( song fades ) ( alarm buzzing ) ( phone ringing ) Oh, God. Morning, Julie! I've had it with him. I can't take it anymore. - Well, what happened? - He won't take his medication, and he threatened me again. I'm sorry. It's too much. I've had enough. - Look-- - I'm leaving. Oh, please don't. I'm sorry, but I'm done. Please, Julie, I really need you. - No. - ( line clicks ) Woman: Julie? Thank you. - What's wrong? - Julie quit. He's impossible. They never stay for more than a month. Want me to start looking for another one? Yeah, I suppose so. I've got the Rahms case to work on tonight, and by the time I've put him to bed-- What about your sister? Can't she help you? Woman: She can't even help herself. ( radio playing faintly ) ( radio continues ) - Morning. - Hi. You hungry? Is there any coffee? Yeah, there is, but you're going to have some breakfast, too. Yes, sir. - Rough night? - One too many. Just one? We were supposed to have dinner. Since when? You really don't remember? No, I thought it was tonight. Tonight's my gig. We can have dinner after. It's in London. I'm staying up there tonight. You forgot that, too. Just give me a break, all right? If you forgive me, I'll make it up to you. Yeah? How? Breakfast in bed? That sounds like dessert. Mmm. I think I'm just going to stick with the coffee. No, you need to eat something, soak up all that booze. Just give it a rest, will you? You want me to stop caring about you? I want you to get off my back. Nora. Nora, I'm worried about you. - I'm fine. - No, you're hungover. And if you're not hungover, you're drunk. That is such bullshit. You've got a problem. Yeah, my boyfriend's a pain in the ass. Nora. Look, I'm really worried about you. Jesus, David, you sound like a stuck record. I want you to stop drinking. Fine! I'll slow down, I promise. I think you need help. All I need is for you to fuck off! - ( alarm chirps ) - ( phone rings ) - Hi. - Man: Where are you? Look, Julie quit. I've got to take care of things over here for awhile. You could have called. I'm sorry. You want me to come over? No, it's okay. I won't be long. I'll be home soon. Fine. Bye. ( television chatter ) Dad? Dad, where are you? Man: In here. Dad, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just fell. Help me up. How long have you been lying here? - Not long. - Come on, let's get you to bed. I'm all right. I'm all right. Come on. Come on. We'll get you all washed up and then I'll start dinner, okay? - All right. - Okay. ( line ringing ) Nora: It's Nora. Leave a message at the beep. ( beep ) ( knocking on door ) ( knocking continues ) ( pounding ) Nora: All right. - Hello, stranger. - Can I come in? Well, I wasn't expecting anyone. - I'm not even dressed. - I tried calling. - Yeah, my phone died. - We need to talk. All right, but the place is a mess. Wow, you weren't kidding about the mess. If you came to give me a lecture-- - I didn't. - What then? It's about Dad. Want a drink? Cup of tea? No, thanks. Another nurse left. What a surprise. How's David? He's good. He's at a gig tonight. Hmm. Shouldn't you be getting ready? I'm not going. - Another fight? - No. Just taking a breather. Are you okay? I'm fine. Look, I really, really need your help with Dad. You sure you don't want a drink? I've got wine. No, I need your help, Nora. I can't do this on my own anymore. It's too-- What do you want me to do? Just-- look, help out with meals. Give him his medicine. He needs a nurse for that. I know. They keep leaving. Please, Nora, just until we find someone else. I'm no good with stuff like that. Look, you said it yourself. You and David need some space. Why don't you just move back home for a few months? Save some money. Get back on your feet. I am on my feet. I really think you and Dad should spend some time together. You never see him. He's welcome here whenever he wants. He doesn't feel well. Well, that's his problem, isn't it? He thinks you still blame him for Mom. Maybe I do. It wasn't his fault. How do you know? She had a mind of her own. No one forced her to drink. Who was buying her the booze, then? If he didn't get it, she would have got it herself. How? She couldn't even get out of bed. He did the best he could, Nora. It's hard to stand by and watch someone you love destroy themselves. Then look the other way. You're good at that. It's his fucking fault the nurses keep leaving. - Forget it! - Not mine! ( phone ringing ) I thought you said it died. Must have come back to life. Yeah. ( ringing continues ) ( music playing ) ( vocalizing ) Shine of the moon Sound of the feet Daylight is soon ( vocalizing ) Scent on the wind As hunters, we're twinned As two hearts beat All right, babe. Wasn't expecting you. Want to come down to pub? - Yeah-- - Lisa, it's past 9. Uh, yeah, we were just going to bed. Aw, come on, babe. Just one. I'm not even dressed, love. Well, look at the state of me. All right, just one. I'll go fix myself up. What you doing coming around here at this hour? Shut up, granddad. I'll have her back before morning. You're fucking unbelievable, you are, do you know that? Jesus Christ. ( vocalizing ) Shine of the moon ( vocalizing ) Scent on the wind As hunters, we're twinned As two hearts beat... Go on! ( vocalizing ) - ( rock music playing ) - ( women singing ) ( cheers and applause ) Thank you very much. Man on PA: Thank you, Nora and Lisa, for that interesting version of "The Show Must Go On." And the show will go on, but I think we better have a little break first. So, Peter, get yourself ready, and first, here's some other music. ( rock music playing ) Still got it, babe. ( growls ) What? Nothing. Come on, spit it out. I just thought maybe you should call Shannon. Why? So she can come round and have a go at me again? Just sounds like she needs your help, babe. It's not my problem. If he wasn't such a cunt to all the nurses, they wouldn't keep leaving. Nora, what's she going to do? I don't know. Find someone else. Maybe you could just go over there in the evenings? That's when David's got his gigs. Anyway, I'm busy looking for a job, remember? How's David? We haven't been getting on lately. The usual shit. All right, do you want me to ask Liam if there are any shifts in the 'caf? Yeah, go on. Thanks, babe. Thought I'd buy you girls a drink for singing that nice song. Yeah, no, it's all right. We got some. Look at that. I just finished mine. I'm going to go. Tommy's going to kick off. Stay for one more. No, I got a morning shift. I'll give you a ring. See what Liam says. Yeah, go on. Thanks. Looks like your friend's walked out on you. I can look after myself. Look after me, too? Maybe. ( rock music playing ) ( music fades ) ( door opens, closes ) ( David sighs ) Nora? Babe, you here? I come in peace. Nora? - What the fuck? - David. David! - Nah, Nora! - I'm sorry. I didn't know! I swear to God! Wait, David! David! - Why? - I'm a drunk, all right? I was wasted, that's all! What, that's it? Huh? You're fucking pathetic! David, please! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was nothing. If it was nothing, then why do it? It might nothing to you, but it means something to me! I'm sorry! Okay? I'm sorry. Get your hands off-- don't touch me. Just let me explain, all right? I'll be back tomorrow night. You be gone by then. David, please. Please, David! - You all right, love? - Is Lisa here? She's a bit busy now. Can you just tell her Nora's here to speak to her? - Please? - Lise? Lise? - Lisa: Yeah? - Nora's here to see you. Babe, what's the matter? Can we talk outside? Uh, can I just-- can I have a ciggie break? - Five minutes, yeah? - All right. Sweetheart. - He'll take you back. - Not this time. I can't believe you went home with that tosser. I was shit-faced. I don't even remember leaving the pub. Nora, you got to be careful. You were careful, weren't you, yeah? Maybe you should move back in with your dad. It might be good for both of you. You got to be with your family at a time like this. - You're my family. - Yeah. But they're your family, too. I really fucked up this time. - Listen. - David was a good one. Call you sister. Tell her you changed your mind. I'm not moving back in with my dad. Can I come and stay at yours? Just till I find somewhere new? Tommy won't have it. Well, just for a week. Not after last time, no. Well, forget it, then. Babe, you know I want to help you. Sorry for just showing up like this. Of cour-- come here. All right. Nor, come on. It's going to be okay. Yeah. I'll call you tonight. Can I help you? Can I see my sister? She's busy at the moment. Well, can you tell her I'm here? I can, but I doubt she'll be able to see you. You should have called first. Just tell her I'm here. Shannon: Yes, Max? Your sister's here. Send her in. Okay. She can see you now. Great. Thanks. Stupid bitch. ( clears throat ) I'm busy. What do you need? I just came to apologize. Forget it. I'm sorry about last night. - I was rude. - It's okay. I mean it, and I want to help. I've got it covered. Don't make me beg, Shannon. Fine. Sit down. Maybe I could help Dad out for a couple of hours in the evenings and some mornings. Won't David mind? We broke up. For good this time. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. But I was thinking it's going to be hard to afford a place of my own now. So you want to move in with Dad? No, not move in. I mean, I don't mind helping out, but I thought maybe you could help me out with the rent. - You're unbelievable. - What? You want me to pay your rent in exchange for looking after Dad? That's not what I meant. He's your father, Nora. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Listen, I'm broke, all right? I was supposed to get this job with Lisa, but it fell through. And that's my responsibility? As if Dad isn't enough, I've got to take care of you, too? - You're my big sister. - Your sister, not your mother. What the fuck are you looking at? You're the fucking help. Get over yourself. ( dog barking in distance ) Dad: Nora? That you? Nora? Hi, Dad. Well, come on in. Let me get a look at you. I look a mess. You look lovely. How you doing? Better for seeing you. Come on, sit yourself down. Who's winning? I am. Haven't played a game in ages. Oh. Well, come on, then. Your move. No, no. Missed you, Dad. Should I get unpacked, then? Yeah, yeah. Go on. We'll have a cup of tea and a proper chat later. ( gasps ) ( floor creaks ) ( gasps ) ( soft clattering ) ( gasps ) Nora: Dinner's ready, Dad. I can smell it. Bringing it in. There you go. I thought we could eat together tonight. Hardly said a word to each other. I've got to go upstairs and make some calls about a job. We'll eat at the table tomorrow night. Promise. All right. ( tone plays ) ( gasps ) ( phone ringing ) - Nora: Shannon? - Hi, Nora. - Hi. - You okay? Yeah, fine. How's Dad? He's good. He's in bed. So everything's all right? Yeah. So I was wondering if you want to come over for dinner tomorrow night. I'm supposed to be having dinner with James. - He can come, too. - Oh, I don't know. Please, Shannon. I'll make my shepherds pie. I promised James. - Please? - Okay. Okay, great. About 7:00, then, yeah? Yeah, okay. ( gasps ) ( doorbell rings ) Dad, can you get that? Dad: I've got it. ( door opens ) David: Hello, sir. Is Nora in? - Dad: Oh, it's you. - David: "It's you?" Dad: No, she's not. I just got some of her stuff. I just want to drop it off. All right, just put it down there. - Is she in? - Go on. No. No, she's not. Just put it down there. She doesn't want to see you. Just tell her to come and get the rest of her stuff. She doesn't need the likes of you coming around here. Now, bugger off! You didn't have to do that. You can do better than him. He just wanted to talk to me. You've got to learn to say no. I'm a grown woman. I can look after myself. That's not what I hear. Come on. Let's not argue. Would you like some more peas, Dad? Mm. - James? - Yes, please. How was work today, Shannon? Good. Busy. The Rahms case is taking up a lot of time. Still not resolved? Can't seem to reach a settlement. - I found a job today. - That's great. Where? At a vintage store. Lisa's mate Trish said she'd put in a good word for me. When do you start? Well, I've got to meet Trish first. So you haven't actually got the job yet. No, but I've got an interview tomorrow, and because Lisa knows Trish, I'm pretty much guaranteed. You're not eating, Shannon. No, sorry. I'm not that hungry. I've got a lot on my mind with work. God, that's all it is with you, isn't it? Work, work, work. I'm eating. It's delicious. There's other things in life besides work, you know. And you'd know? Yeah, actually, I would. Well, you certainly have a lot of time on your hands to discover those other things. That's enough, girls. Bet it ain't easy being married to a lawyer. Always a clever answer. You don't seem to mind the lawyer's paycheck. See what I mean? I said, that's enough. - I'm finished. - Yeah, me, too. Did I say you could leave the table? I'm not a kid anymore. I don't need your permission. Why do you always have to ruin everything? Don't worry. I'm leaving. Sit back down this minute, young lady. Or what? Oh, fuck this. Fuck the lot of you. I don't need this shit. ( door opens, closes ) ( rock music playing ) Lisa: Hello, darling. How are you? Nora: Good. What are you so happy about? - ( laughs ) - ( gasps ) Congratulations. - Thanks. - You deserve it. I can't believe he finally asked me. What do you mean you can't believe it? He's mad about you. Yeah, he took his time, though. Well, you know what men are like. They want everything in place before they ask. All right, so, we're planning on getting married next summer. Where are you going to do it? Don't know yet, but will you be my maid of honor? Of course, I will. Come on, let's celebrate. Hey! We're drying up over here. You all right, babe? Yeah, why wouldn't I be? You're getting married and I'm back at home with my dad. Things couldn't be better. I thought you'd be happy for me. I'm sorry, Lise. I am happy for you. I really am. All right, come on. Let's get some champers. It's my treat. Yeah? Yeah, come on. ( chattering ) ( laughing ) ( laughing ) - Oh, my-- ( giggles ) - Who parked this car? Are you all right to drive? Yeah, I've been on water the last hour. Anyway, it would be mad to get in a cab at this time of night. I'm going to call Tom and get him to pick us up. He'll be in bed with his tea and slippers by now. Anyway, I drive better when I've had a drink... motherfuckers. You're a fucking nut. You know you are. That's why you love me. Anyway, come on. Let's go. Freezing my ass off here. ( groans ) Come on. - ( honks horn ) - Fuck off. Fucking go. I'm going your way. ( humming ) Whoa. It's fine. It's totally fine. ( dance music on radio ) - Oh! It hurts. - Seatbelt! Oh, all right! See you, suckers! ( groans ) What? You still haven't unpacked, then? Only what I need. Things okay over there? Yeah. Bit of the barmy tonight, but it's been all right. David came over this morning. - Ooh! - Dad chased him away. Oh, no way! Your dad is mental like that. That's how he was when any boys came over. He was scared stiff of him. I'm glad David came round. I'll call him tomorrow. It's all going to be all right. Oh, fuck. ( laughing ) Forever or ever. - ( truck horn blares ) - ( Nora shrieks ) How are you feeling? My head hurts. You have a bad concussion and a broken wrist. Other than that, you'll be fine. My friend? I'm so sorry, love. She didn't make it. What? The truck hit the passenger side of the car. The doctors said she died instantly. She didn't feel any pain. She's dead? It was an accident. Does her boyfriend know? He's here. Someone is with him now. Nora, the police want to talk to you. I can hold them off a little longer, but you'll have to see them eventually. The police? You had quite a lot to drink. Your sister's waiting outside. Do you want her to come in? - No. - Come on. It'll be all right. How are you doing? - Lisa's dead? - I heard. She just got engaged. Let's focus on your case. Did you hear what I said? I heard what you said. You're in real trouble this time. It was an accident. That doesn't mean you're not responsible. You were three times over the legal limit to drive. The only thing in your favor is the fact the the truck driver jumped the light. What's going to happen? The maximum penalty is seven years... ...but there are mitigating factors, so the judge may reduce your sentence. If you're lucky, you'll get two to three. Seven years? You got drunk and killed your best friend. There's no apologizing your way out of this one. That's enough, now. My patient needs her rest. How long before she can leave? She'll be ready for discharge tomorrow provided she's allowed to rest. I'll be back tomorrow. Shannon. I never meant for it to hap-- Shannon: We'll talk tomorrow. You ready, love? Man: Nora Gallagher, whilst I accept that you have shown extreme remorse for your actions and pleaded guilty to the offense, I cannot ignore that you were driving under the influence of alcohol and were three times over the legal limit. You showed a reckless disregard both for your own life and that of your best friend. Had you been sober that night, Lisa Jennings may still be alive and well today. And for that reason, I must impose a custodial sentence. I hereby sentence you to two years in prison with parole to be had after twelve months. ( muted chatter ) ( buzzer, gate slams ) ( exhales ) You'll get used to it. Where did they put you? Kitchen. Whose dick did you shake to get that job? Everyone needs friends in here, even assholes like them. Do you want me to watch your back? What's that going to cost me? - That depends. - On what? What you got to offer. Not much. Then you're shit out of luck. - Got some more for you. - I'm not doing yours. - You better. - Pick it up, you little fucking bitch. I'm not doing it. She said pick it up, bitch! ( buzzer ) You going to fucking do it? Get off me, all right? I will fuck you up. Pack it in. That's enough, girls. - Playtime's over. - All right. Woman: Not very good at this, are you? I've never really played much before. Well, you'll have plenty of time to practice now. Great. Thanks. You better get your head around it. This isn't some dream you're going to wake up from. I'm getting that. Man on PA: Lights out. ( buzzer, gate slams ) - Nora? - What? What you in here for? I thought you weren't supposed to ask that. I'm asking. Drunk driving. Did you hit someone? My best friend was in the car with me. - Dead? - Yeah. - You got family? - A sister. She going to visit? I hope so. My mom comes every month. Brings my son. You've got a kid? He's thirteen. Missed a lot of good years. I was thirteen when my mom died. - What of? - Sherry. That's a lot of sherry. Yeah. So what about you? How come you're in here? None of your business. Night, then. Night. - ( buzzer ) - ( muted chatter ) Aw, get away, you fucking poser. - Piss off! - ( women shouting ) ( man shouts ) You're up. Enough! - Hiya, Dave. - Hey. Sorry. I must look awful. I don't know, you always did look good in tracksuits. Oh, yeah? Thanks for coming. I should have come before. That's all right. Come sit down. It's grown. By the time I get out, it'll be down to my knees. How much longer have you got? 18 months, but Shannon thinks I can be out in a year if I behave myself. Well, there's no chance, then. - You look well. - Yeah? Well, I've been keeping busy. How you're music going? Good. Good. I've got a gig on the pier next week. - Oh, that's great. - Yeah, yeah. Shannon been to see you? A couple of times. Job ties her up. What about your dad? It's hard with the chair and all. Didn't slow him down when I came around. He's meaner than he looks. He's all right. He was just trying to protect you. Look, you need anything? I'd love to hear some of your new music. Maybe you could burn me a CD or something. Yeah? Yeah. I miss hearing you play. I miss you. I miss you, too. So have you seen Tommy, then? A couple times around town. How's he doing? Look, I've been to the cemetery. I left some flowers for you. Thanks. So you seeing someone, then? Yeah. Good. You happy? Yeah. Well, that's good. You deserve it. Time. Look, Nora, are you okay in here? Yeah, I'm getting by. Man: I said "time." - Thanks for coming. - All right. I'll see you soon. - Let's go. - All right. ( buzzer ) - Come with me. - What are you doing? Shut your mouth. ( zipper unzips ) Take it out. Well, don't just look at it. You all right? ( sobbing ) Nora, are you okay? What's wrong? ( sobbing ) Come on, it's going to be all right. No, it's not. Hey, listen. It was an accident. It weren't your fault. You didn't mean anyone to get hurt. I was drunk, killed my best friend. Come on, now. You've got to let it go. You've got to get your head together. It should've been me. That kind of talk is not going to help. All right? All right, all right. Okay. - I'm okay. - Shh, shh. All right, thank you. You're so beautiful. Karen. Karen, what are you doing? We don't have to be alone. Karen, no. You feel so good. Karen, get the fuck off me! - ( women shouting ) - Man: Pipe down, eh? Woman: Shut your fucking face! - ( guards shouting ) - Fuck you! Man #2: Get her out of there. Get off me! Get your fucking hands off me! Man: Shut up, all of you! I need a medic now. I need a medic now! Get off me! Get the fuck off me! No! No! I was defending myself! I was defending myself! No! No! No! Aah! ( sobbing ) Aah! ( squawking ) Woman: Nora. Wake up. ( gasps ) Let me out! Get me out of here! Leave me alone! Nora, wake up. I lost my key. Get in quick before Dad sees you. Aren't you going to get changed? We have to leave in a minute. I'm not going. Dad's going to kick off. Tell him I don't feel well. Dad: Nora? You slept out last night, did you? I lost my key. Where'd you stay? At Lisa's. You're dressed like a slut! - Come with me. - Where are we going? Never you mind. Let's get a move on. Shannon: Nora? Nora, are you in here? Come on, stop messing around. What the hell are you doing? What's wrong? Where's Dad? I don't know. He's out. Help me up. What? You're bleeding. I'm fine. Let's get out of here. - What happened? - Nothing! It's all right. You can tell me anything. Just leave me alone! ( door opens ) Not a word. - Dad: Hi, girls! - Hiya, Dad. Good day at school, Shannon? Yeah, good, Dad. How you feeling, Nora? I'll be fine to go to school tomorrow. Glad to hear it. I got an A on my English test. Hey, that's my girl. Can I show you? Come and help me with this one first. Shannon: She was clearly provoked. Woman: Miss Parker was in hospital for two days with a broken nose and severe concussion. And my sister's been in solitary confinement for over three days without an official hearing. Did you even question Nora before segregating her? She was hardly in a fit enough state to be questioned. She's a danger to herself and to others. In the sixth months that she's been here, she's shown no violent tendencies and has an immaculate record. Everyone has a breaking point, Ms. Gallagher. Let's discuss what could have provoked the incident. Records from Karen Parker's stay at Highpoint. Did you know she was accused of sexually assaulting two inmates during her time there? With all due respect, Ms. Gallagher, I don't see how that's relevant. Really? I bet the independent monitoring board would find it relevant. I expect my sister to be released from solitary confinement immediately and relocated to a different cell. Good day, Ms. Pierce. ( sighs ) ( keys jingling ) Get some rest, love. - Shannon. - How are you? I'm better now, thanks to you. Sit. Are you in your own cell? Yeah. Is that for me? Yeah. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. Dad's been asking after you. He told me to send you his love. He's been a lot better with the nurses, too. That's great. I helped put in an application for your parole, and I really think we could have you out of here within a few months. Really? Yeah. As long as you stay out of trouble. Thanks for everything, Shannon. Not just for this, but for always trying to take care of me. I know I haven't been the easiest person to love. The only thing that matters is that we get you out of here. - Just stay out of trouble. - I will. ( buzzer, gate slams ) Nora: I've learnt my lesson. I made a terrible mistake. But I intend to go to regular AA meetings like I've been doing in here, because I understand now I've got to take responsibility for my actions, stop blaming other people for my bad choices. ( no audible dialogue ) I got your room ready. - I'm not going to Dad's. - He's got a nurse. You won't have to do anything. - It's not that. - What is it, then? I just think I need a fresh start. He's really been looking forward to seeing you. He's missed you so much. Where are you going to stay, then? David said I could stay with him for a few days. Just till I find somewhere new. I'd hardly call David a fresh start. Please, Shannon. I don't want to fight. Well, neither do I, babe, but, look, I just don't understand. Dad's going to be heartbroken. Remember that day you found me on the front step? And later you came home and I was hiding in the shed? I think so. It was the year Mom died. I'd stayed home from school. Well, that narrows it down. Something happened that day, Shannon. I know. You got your period, right? That's why you were hiding in there. God, it must have been awful without Mom to talk to. But at least we've still got Dad. Sure this isn't a bother? Of course not. I don't want to mess things up with your girlfriend. We're not together anymore. What happened? Wasn't meant to be and all that. Sorry. You kept it. It was a good day. I didn't break up with my girlfriend. What? There never was one. I ain't been seeing anyone. Then why did you say you were? Because I was angry. - You had reason to be. - I know. You still angry? ( sighs ) I'm feeling a lot of things right now. Me, too. Night, then. Night. Nora? I'm glad you're here. Me, too. I'm sorry, Dad. She didn't want to be a nuisance. Where's she staying? With David, but she'll come and visit as soon as she's back on her feet. Did you tell her we got her room ready? Come on, she'll be over soon. Dinner's almost ready. Dad: Slept out last night, did you? Young Nora: I lost my key. - Dad: Where'd you stay? - Young Nora: At Lisa's. Dad: You're dressed like a slut! - Dad: Come with me. - Young Nora: Where are we going? Dad: Never you mind. Let's get a move on! - Aah! Stop it! - Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Nora! Nora, it's me. It's me. It's David. Shh, shh. It's me. It's me. Sorry. I had a bad dream. Okay, but you're safe now. - Okay? - Yeah. Thanks. Your Dad's been ringing. Yeah? Do you want me to take you over? Not yet. He still loves you, you know, no matter what's happened. What if I don't love him? Come on. Nora, he can be a pain in the ass, but he's still your dad. ( no audible dialogue ) You sure you don't want me to come with you? I've got to do this on my own. You call me if you need me. I'll be waiting right here. Thank you. Hello. You must be Nora. - Yeah. - Come on in. Dad's been expecting you. Actually, I was wondering if I could see him on my own for a bit. Yes, of course you can. - I'll get my coat. - I won't be very long. I've got some errands to run. You take your time. Dad: Nora? That you? It's good to see you, love. It's good to see you, Dad. Fancy a cuppa? Betsy will make one. No, I'm all right. You've been well, then? Better for seeing you. Been worried about you. I'm all right. Heard you got into some trouble, some kind of fight. I was defending myself. Those bastards, locking you up like that, like some kind of animal. I was in there for a reason, Dad. Lisa was an accident. You didn't mean to hurt anyone. Sometimes we do things we don't mean to and other people pay the price. Well... ...you did your time. I hope you can let it go now. When I was in solitary, I had a lot of time to think. About? Some things that happened when I was a kid. Best not to dig up the past, Nora. I thought about Mum dying, how hard that must have been for you, how lonely. Did you hear what I said? I don't want to talk about it. But I do, Dad. And if I don't, then I don't think I'm going to make it. So was it lonely when Mom died? Of course it bloody was. I was left on my own to look after two teenage girls. You weren't the easiest kid to look after, believe you me. I missed my mom. I acted out. We all missed her. I look the most like her, though, don't I? Shannon looks more like you. Is that what you've come round here for, to torture me about your mother? Because if it is, you can leave now. This family's been through enough as it is. The strain of your accident has nearly killed your sister. I'm sorry, Dad. That's not going to work anymore. I've had enough of this crap. Where's Betty? She's gone out. It's just the two of us now. - Get out of my way. - No, not this time. Prison's done something funny to you. You need help. I'm ringing Shannon. You're not calling anyone. Not until I've said my piece. How dare you? I'm your father, Nora. You've got no right to speak to me like that! And what right did you have, you rotten bastard? I was your daughter, for God's sake. Spent the rest of my life trying to understand what I'd done wrong. All those years I spent on the bottle fucking up my life. And if you could've just reached out, just told me why you'd done it-- Don't know what you're talking about. Oh, come, Dad, it's over. Don't you get it? All the lies, all the fucking bullshit. It's over. - Your sister-- - What about her? She won't believe you. No, she probably won't, but that doesn't mean to say I won't do my best to convince her. Well, what good will that do? Look at me. I'm an old man. I've not got many years left. Don't take her away from me. Tell me why you did it. Come on! I didn't mean it to happen. I just wanted to teach you a lesson. A lesson? I didn't know how to handle you, wearing all those clothes and coming in all hours. I was thirteen. I'd just lost my mum. Please don't tell her, Nora. I'm begging you. I'll do anything you want. Just tell me what to do. Oh, Dad. Nora? I'm sorry. Please forgive me. ( bell tolling ) I heard you were out. Yeah. Tommy, I'm sorr-- Oh, I know you are. Don't ask me to forgive you, because I can't. You understand? Yeah, I do. See you around. - Hiya. - Hey. Thanks for coming. You're out early. Yeah, trying to take things easier these days. James and I are going away for the weekend. Oh, that's great. You guys deserve some time alone together. How are things with David? Nice. We're starting out just friends. Oh, yeah? Where are you sleeping? On the couch... for now. Yeah. I heard you went round to Dad's. Yeah. We talked. He seemed pretty upset when I saw him. He'll be all right. He's got you, hasn't he? And you've got me. I love you. I love you. Back from the badlands With the wind and the silence And the cold winter nights And nature's hard violence Been scraping the soil For a handful of stones Got an ache in my heart Got in an ache in my bones Want a new tomorrow Want a brand-new life Want some quality time With a house And a car, and a wife No time for excuses No time to cry Excuses are useless Too late for lies But I love you, baby This much is true I'm dying inside If our love is through A new tomorrow Life could be sweet We should be living On quality street We could be living On quality street I'd hate you to think I'd hurt you at all When all this time I've been on... ( song fades )
