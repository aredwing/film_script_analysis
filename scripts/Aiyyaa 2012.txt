The girl's father, who smokes... ...not one, two or three but four cigarettes in a row. And one of the dogs at the gate will tear your pant.

My neighbour works for the censor board. Let us watch all the films. Look, Mynah, just tell me my job. I don't want to see any unreleased films. And anyway, my life's filled with drama. I don't want anymore. Where's the stench coming from? I don't know. Oh my! What are you doing? I know I can't touch him... ...but at least I can get a good look at him. That's John. John's my life. John's just mine. His body, his muscles are just for me. Look, Meenaxi. Look at his body, look at his muscles. Any... Any lower and it would've ruined the beauty. But he's John.

It's fragrant, has empty-spaces... ...where the sun's rays fall. Foreign locations or Indian? Don't interrupt me, Mynah. Don't interrupt. Listen. I didn't demand too much from life. I still don't. I want someone all to myself. And when I we fall in love... ...he'll say Meenaxi, let's runaway and get married. And then I'd steal all the jewels from my home... ...and take the late-night passenger train. Far away, far, far away. Where the Maharashtrian police never find us. See. I've a small dream. But girls like me... ...have to struggle for... ...fulfil their dreams. First with herself, then with her parents... ...and then the guardian of this society. But this evening... ...l'm going to face the reality of life. Face the reality of life. I never did it. How will you do it? Like this. She makes really tasty 'pohe'. And you just can't resist the yoghurt. Oh my! Oh, God! Oh my! Oh, God! We'll give her 30 grams of gold. And Meenaxi's grandma's golden dentures... ...has already been willed in her name. I have 10 daughters. And Bablu's my only son. My mother-in-law and her mother-in-law's still alive. Will you give me a facial after we get married? Are you vegetarian or non-vegetarian?

And you just can't resist the yoghurt. She makes really tasty 'pohe'. And you just can't resist the yoghurt. Come on, Pinky. Hurry up. Stand in a line. Stand in a line. Come on. Did you breakup?

Trying to... The state of my heart, like the petals of flowers. The ambience fresh like dawn. The glittering stars in the day. All shining brightly upon you. See them if you can. There's a sweet story in the air. Trying to... Stop going to the office. You've turned wheatish due to travelling under the sun. And you don't have a clue about what you should do. Make the bread properly. Do it properly. What is this? Smear some oil. Smear some more oil. You can't even knead the dough properly... ...and you're so keen about working on the computer. And you. Do you have to smoke while eating? Yes, yes I do. Mother. All those who came to see me... ...I didn't like any of them. Please stop putting me on display every day. Where do you get these nerds from? Why? Are you expecting someone rich and handsome? Soon enough. Destiny will bring the one to me. These daily tea and pohe' programs won't help. That must be the rich and handsome. Hello. Hello, hello. Remember that boy who came to see you in the evening. Must be his rejection call. I am sure. - Nana. Yes, yes. I've always heard father saying Yes, yes Yes, yes, yes, yes. I never understand what he's saying. Remember the Kulkarnis who visited us day before yesterday? It must be them. Last night I dreamt about Goddess. And she gave me a yellow coloured flower. Mother. What's the yellow flower... ...got to do with Kulkarni's son? And anyway, I found him a big bore. First of all, he's too fair. And I don't like boys who wear a vest under their shirt. They look just like dentists. Do you stand there and observe... ...whether the boy's wearing a vest inside or not? Is a man judged by the vest he's wearing? No, it's judged by something else. Nana. Shameless. What happened? It was Mr. Kulkarni. Didn't I say it must be them? What happened? When are they coming? Or shall we go visit them? - No. Their demands were too high, Savitri. This alliance isn't possible. It's beyond our budget. Oh wow! Perfectly round bread. Here, Nana. Have a ball. Look from here. See... There's a sweet story in the air. Trying to... The state of my heart, like the petals of flowers. The ambience fresh like dawn. The glittering... The drops of colours. Turned my lifeless dreams... into grand reality. The lonely lanes of my heart. Is now swarmed with feelings. Yes, it is. Let's walk this mile. It's the abode of my dreams. Even though I mustered some sleep. It still revolves around you... Weave them into one. There's a sweet story in the air. Trying to... Trying to convey itself through the breeze. The sweet... Story... Conveys... Through the breeze. The sweet... Story... Conveys... Through the breeze. Surya. Surya, get up and have some tea. What this? Get lost! SURYA. Let me sleep. This is my time to sleep. Why did you bring tea at this hour? Surya, did you eat last night? I've brought biscuits for you. Pakda Pandi, are you stupid? Get me bun omelette. Are the vegetables fresh? Last time, you cheated me while weighing it. Oh my! Hi! Surya. Good morning. Hey! What? What happened? Mom. Mom, let's go. What happened? - Let's go. Just take me away from here. Yes, but... - Let's go, mom. But. - Let's go, mom. I'm feeling dizzy. Let's go, mom. You work too hard, Meenaxi. Don't work too hard... ...and raise the standards of working. It'll be really difficult for girls like me. I... Remember, Mynah, I told you about my dreams. Yes. You did. I... The principal has asked for some details. About Surya. - Surya? That drunk Madrasi. What's there to see in his records? He's a fishy guy. He drinks all night, Meenaxi. Have you seen his eyes? Red. They say he had a rich father. He squandered his father's wealth on drinking. What are you saying, Mynah? It says here he's received a Fellowship... ...from the Central Government... ...because he's an outstanding student. Mynah, don't lie. I am not crazy to say all this. Meenaxi, I am not talking shit. The Fellowships are rigged. Fellowships won't make a difference. Like I said... ...his father died repaying his debts. Yet, this boy I tell you... - Really? That... that... ...student in our college... You were talking to him yesterday. Surya. Yes, what about him? What were you two talking about? What do you know about him? I don't know anything about anyone. Go away. Don't talk to me. People waste my time... and I've to bear the brunt. I've heard that if these people don't drink... ...their career never takes off. Everyone has to resort to these kind of nonsense... ...for selling their painting. God! Is that really true? Pakkad Pandi. Get me a cup of tea. Pakkad Pandi. There are two chocolate bars on the table. One's for speaking up. And the others for keeping mum. What do I say, sister? You won't be able to hear it. - I will hear everything. Tell me. Surya does drugs. - What? You know what drugs are? How old are you? What do you know about drugs? He's always on drugs... ...to get into his world of imagination. Oh, God. But I do that without them. These artists have a very controversial life. I've heard such stories. Which one do I tell you? Surya. - That's why Surya sees all that... ...you and I cannot see. I didn't get you. What can he see? Surya sees things differently. That's why he wins a gold medal. No, no, no. The drugs are just rumours. I don't believe it. I can't believe Surya does drugs. Oh gosh! Let's talk about you. Jumbo's sitting on your table. Jumbo? The red water bag. Mynah's? What about it? Don't you know? Mynah's the real culprit. She fills it with Vodka every morning. I wonder how Surya's been winning the gold medal... ...for the last two years. He must have a high connection. Only his paintings are sent to Delhi for the Academic exhibition. Connections, again. That's the reason he's still in the college. Otherwise, there's no reason to keep this animal here. The way he looks... ...I don't like him at all. Pakda Pandi, are you stupid? Stop doing this every night... ...Eat on time, sleep on time. If you continue like this someday you will die. Pakkad Pandi. I need your help. Just name it, sister. I am always ready to help damsels in distress. My sweet child. Listen. Wow. Wow. One, two... ...three, four... ...five. One... - Wow. Wow. One, two... ...three, four... Wow. Ask him what's libido in Tamil? Mynah, stay quiet. I like dark people not fair ones. Teach me that. I like dark people not fair ones. No, no. 'Karappa' means cockroach... ...'Karp' means dark. Madam, you forget so soon. Ok, fine. Okay, how do I say... ...Give me love, and I'll give you rice-cakes and pancakes. Give me love, and I'll give you rice-cakes and pancakes. Give me love, and I'll give you rice-cakes and pancakes. Super-duper correct. Now, here's a suggestion. Watch Tamil channels the entire night. 'Midnight masala.' You'll learn Tamil in a jiffy. Oh my! I can certainly do that. Here you go. Thank you. - Thank you. Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Sweetheart! As you stretched your body passionately. Made me realise once again. I finally say this today. Books. Please sign here. Thanks. Feel free to come! I love you. Love you! I do not want you to shave. I do not want you to shave. Wow. Wow. I do not want you to shave. You look handsome. You look handsome.

Time for audio... visual training. 'Midnight masala.' Oh, God! Oh, God! Wake up from dream... in critical condition. Earth quivering below, everything shaking up. Face to face, with the man of dreams. Top to base, filled with passion. Thighs thundering, down under. Size matters, thinking, wondering. Jumping. Pumping. Throbbing. Thumping One, two, three, four. Heart pounding. Beating like drums. Love lust to double the fun, it's so stern. Body heating. Feeling like hot seat. Calling fire-brigade, but no difference. Dwell in my heart, same to same. Top to base, filled with passion. Thighs thundering, down under. Size matters, thinking, wondering. Jumping. Pumping. Female. Male. One, two, three, four. Nana. What is it? You're still awake. What to do? I just can't sleep. Even if I do, I can't dream. And if I don't dream, there's no point in sleeping. True. True. Want some. Nana. Tell me. I was saying... That thing... that... I mean the thing that rich kids... ...take in parties before food. Beer. Oh no, not beer. Of you take that the police arrests you. Yes... Cocaine! No. Not cocaine. Drugs. Drugs. They are all the same. Drugs are a kind of cocaine. What about it? Do drugs make your body... ...smell better? Don't know. Maybe. Must be an expensive A+ grade drug. Yes, it's possible. So where do you find these drugs? Why? Just like that. I'm reading that Tamil Pulp Fiction. They're holding a competition. Find the places in your city where you can get drugs. Do you know where we can get drugs? I want to send them an answer. No. I don't know. Oh yes. The river in our city. The last bridge over it, near the crematorium. Every night a man stands under it. From two to four. A European man. He has these goods. I don't care about humans anymore, Meenaxi. They're a bunch of liars and thieves. That's fine. But what have you decided about your future? Are you going to study or not? You'll have to choose a line of work as well. Now this is my job, Meenaxi. Just watch. I'm going to build a big home for dogs. 'Kutta Ghar' (Dog House). It'll be 12 storeys high. And have every amenity for dogs. First, I'll be the sole proprietor. Then, I'll make it Pvt. Ltd. I will give you shares as well. Just watch, Meenaxi. One day we'll have public issue of our company. Then London, Hong Kong, Paris. We'll have branches everywhere. Look. Is he the one? Yes, I think he's the one. Selling drugs. Let's go home. I'm so sleepy. Wait. If there's just one lake in the jungle... ...then all the animals must come here. Jungle? Animals? - Yes. Now I'm really interested in these animals. I see. Nana. - What? How much money do you have? Around 100, 110. Why? I have 200. Here. Go. Go where? Go to that man and buy drugs worth 300. Ask him, whether he's got the A+, aromatic one? Go on. - Meenaxi, you've really lost your mind. Have you lost it? Let's go. Let's go from here. It's not for me. I just... ...want to smell it. Go on. No, I am not going anywhere. Have you lost your mind? Let's go. Let's go from here. Useless. You will public issues of your company. Coward. Give me all your money. Give it, give it, give it, give it. Take it, take it, take it.

Such pretty saris. And at half the rate. Half the rate. Is this the time to buy saris? I don't want your saris. Get lost. Aunt. Aunt. Aunt. You've a sad story, dear. The things women have to do to run their home. So, did your father never try to find you... ...after leaving you at the orphanage? May God bless him... ...wherever he is. And you? Your family, grandchildren. I don't have any family or grandchildren. All I have is a son. I wonder when he'll get married? Wait here, I'll be right back. Child. Where were you? Here. Have some coffee before you leave. You will like it. Dear. Are you married? No. What type of daughter-in-law are you looking for? Who would be foolish enough to give us their daughter? We aren't what we were before. I wonder when and how my son will get married. I wonder if making paintings lands him a job or not? What are you saying, aunt? These painters... look just like Guru Dutt in college. Cigarette in one hand, cruel world. Torn clothes. Broken hearts. And once they pass out, they turn into Aamir Khan. Surya will surely become Aamir Khan. How do you know his name? Where did you see his paintings? Do you have water supply 24 hours a day? How many children do you have? How many rooms do you have? Who cooks in your house? Do you want dowry? What type of daughter-in-law are you looking for? Modern daughter, who goes out and works... ...or the ones that sit at home, like in television serials. Do you stay here or do you keep visiting Tamil Nadu? Maa, open the door. Quick. He's back. Must have forgotten something. Move. Maa, I'm getting late. What? Why are you waving? Get lost. Oh my! I was waiting for you. I know. By the way, what films do you like? Meaning? I like what everyone else does. And you? - Well... I'm a bit old-fashioned when it comes to films. Why? - Don't know. But violent, revenge stories, I don't like these things. Do you know who my favourite actors are? Farooq Shaikh and Deepti Naval. Have you seen their films? No. Who's Deepti Naval? Deepti Naval! Deepti Naval... You must watch her films. I will show you. I mean... ...we'll watch their films together. Such amazing chemistry between them. Oh, my God! Out of this world. And... that's my idea of an ideal romance. Then I'll have to watch those movies. What did they do in the films? - Nothing. Nothing? I mean... they were ordinary people. Just like our neighbours. No makeup or glossy designer clothes. They didn't wear designer clothes. - Never. What were they doing in films? And... and there wasn't much singing and dancing in their films. No songs and dance? They had songs. And... they conveyed their expression... ...this way. Through their eyes. And Deepti Naval. Deepti Naval! Oh, my God! Since I saw you... I realised. Since I saw you... I realised. Life's blazing sun, and you're the cool shade. The heart... - Expressed a desire again. The heart expressed a desire again. Once again I explained my heart. Once again I explained my heart. Life's blazing sun, and you're the cool shade. Since I saw you... I realised. Meenaxi Are you always this quiet? No, it's not that. I'm the only one talking since evening. Fine. I'll leave. Madhav. Thank you. What for? You're the first boy to ask what I wanted. What I felt. I... - So? I... actually... No. It's nothing. And thank you for singing that song. Without you, I will die... Stop the serial, and start cartoons. Tell me! Tell me! Mother-in-law. Nandini's going to rise from the dead today. Meenaxi Meenaxi What is it, mother? What did you two do? Where did you go? What did you two eat? I swallowed two dozens of sleeping pill. And a bottle of Dettol. And if I still don't die... ...l'm going to jump in front of the moving train tomorrow. Or else set myself, you, this house, neighbours on fire. Or I'll turn into a witch and cast a spell on everyone. What's happening with my life? Oh, God! She's so dramatic. God. Meenakshi, you're going to get engaged soon. And then marriage. I need time to think. - Fine, think. Until then I'll boil the milk. Mom, I need time to think about the engagement. You can think about it even after your engagement. What's the point in thinking about it now? Right now, quit yourjob and get a facial. Tomorrow we're visiting Madhav's place. To see your home. Which isn't yours yet, but soon it'll be. The darling of this house. Have you put on Pogo channel? My... Bring it... With the breeze... With the breeze... - 26. Let me come inside. Actually, we're building a double bed for Madhav and Meenaxi Madhav used to sleep alone on a single bed until now. And now... Say your dialogue... Where is Madhav? Shall I prepare tea and 'pohe'? Madhav. Our Madhav is like that. Once he takes some job in his hand, he will surely complete it. He is here. Oh! You all have come? Father. Why didn't you tell me? Please be seated. I'll just go change. I mean... I and Meenaxi Please go ahead. Yes. - Come. Let's go. I have fallen in love. What... My beloved... Love... With me... Love... Sandal 1. Sandal 2. Meenakshi, run. I couldn't run. Run. Run. I couldn't run, but you run away. Run. Run. Run away, quickly. Here. Where is Meenakshi? Meenaxi... What do you mean? She must be coming. After freshening up, straightening her lipstick. No, no, Meenakshi isn't upstairs. I thought she came down with all of you. Meenakshi is like an empty plastic bag. She's gone with the wind. She's gone with the wind. She's gone with the wind. Come to me... You came after a long time. I've something for you. Take it. When do I come back for the rest? Every word you say. Resonates... Like melody in my ears. Like melody in my ears. My body's so helpless. I didn't listen to my heart. The heart says the body's a deceiver. The heart says the body's a deceiver. Oh God! It creates a stir. Oh God! It creates a stir. What's this passion in my heart? There's an excitement in my heart. Oh God! It creates a stir. Oh God! It creates a stir. Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! I borrowed few colours from the fervour of youth. And filled my dreams with colours. I crossed every boundary. What's this desire fuelling me? Wherever I get the sweet scent of my beloved. My heart starts to sway. I raced out of the gardens. And ran after the bees. Bound to captivity. This poor prey. Locks eyes with her hunter... Locks eyes with her hunter... My body's so helpless. I didn't listen to my heart. The heart says the body's a deceiver. The heart says the body's a deceiver. Oh God! It creates a stir. Oh God! It creates a stir. What's this passion in my heart? There's an excitement in my heart. Oh God! It creates a stir. Oh God! It creates a stir. Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! Meenaxi Meenaxi Come on. Let's go, Meenaxi We're already late. The show starts at 6 o'clock. Meenaxi Hey mister. What's going on? Look, the office is closed. We're not available. And we don't want any vacuum cleaner... ...or water purifier. - No, no, I know her... Meenakshi, please tell her. - Don't try to sell anything here. You salesman. Get lost. Can I talk to you please? Can I talk to you please? Madhav! Madhav! Comrades, charge ahead. Long live revolution! Long live revolution! Long live revolution! Sing songs. Hurry up. Get to work. Sing songs. Come on, Meenakshi, let's take you to the beauty parlour. What? - Let's go. What's going here? And when did you all arrive? I don't want to go to any beauty parlour. Meenaxi Mother. - My Meenaxi Anju-Manju! Kamla-Vimla! Come on take her to the beauty parlour. - Mother. What are they all doing here? Our home seems like a movie set! What's today? Today's your engagement, dear. Madhav's coming with his relatives in the evening. Did you forget? What? - Yes. It's today? - Yes. Why didn't you tell me, mother? This isn't something you forget. Go and take a bath, quickly. Let her get ready. Come on. I completely forgot. How are you, aunt? Drink 'Complan'. Go ahead. Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me you witch. I want to drink. - No! Don't drink it! - Leave me! Leave me! - I want to drink it. Please don't tell anyone, Mynah. I thought before I get engaged... ...I will... I will... - What? Whenever he's around, I... I... - What? Nothing. What's your future husband's name? - Madhav. Madhav Rajadhyaksh. He's too nice. But me... - I am nice too. Being nice doesn't get you married. Do you know everything about him? Wait. Meanakshi. He's pure husband material. See. He grows roses on his terrace. And no records of any girlfriend either. Marry him. Forget all about Surya. Maybe that's what I'm going to do. That's what I I'll have to do. That's life. Fall in love with one and marry another. Meenakshi, don't cry. Don't cry. Marry this Madhav. Stay with him for a few years. And keep a watch on Surya online. How much does his painting sell for? What's his social circle? What do the critics say about him? Keep an eye on everything. And if you see he's getting famous. Then you can have an affair with him. No one's stopping you. After all love is not everything, baby. We don't need love and all. Oh, beloved. I'm your sweetheart. I swallowed my tears. Wonder how I lived like this. What's my helplessness? How do I tell you what happened. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Come. Come. Are all the arrangements done? Yes, Nana, it's all done. Except for one thing. - What's that, Nana? Meenaxi Meenakshi's missing. She must be somewhere around. - No, she isn't anywhere around. What? - Yes. Yes. Oh, God. I was busy with the preparations entire day. I thought she's gone to the beauty parlour. Goddess. What to do? Cigarette. I need a cigarette. Cigarette. Can I've a cigarette? Can I've a cigarette? Cigarette. Can I've a cigarette? Hello. - Hello. Hello. Come in. Careful. Careful. Careful. Come in. Come in. Hello. Come. - Looking nice. Come in. - Come. Meenaxi I don't see Meenakshi anywhere. She's gone to the temple. To pray to our family deity. We don't carry out any auspicious event... ...before praying to her. I see. Nana. Nana. Nana. Madhav has arrived, Nana. What now? Look here. Her office diary. It has some useful numbers. Look. Some Mynah. I'll go check with her. Maybe... we can learn something. Then go, Nana. Go quickly. Go quickly. Bring her back from wherever she is. Have some sweets. Save me! Here, Madhav. Have some sweets. Sweets. We aren't here for the sweets. Where is Meenakshi? She... What's wrong, mom? Where's Meenakshi? Save me! Save me! Hi. What the... Hi. I knew it. I knew it. Today's the night. You were destined to come here. To me. In my arms. All this is happening with me for the first time. But the feelings wonderful. And I feel something happening as well. Drink. Drink. Drink. You're mine. I am yours. An astrologer once told me. - What? This full moon night... ...the love of your life will come ringing the bell. The bell in my heart. The bell in my mind. And that young man will be your beloved. Your love. Your sweetheart. What to do, not to do. Stop thinking, just do-do. Some things I do myself. The rest you do. Come closer, darling, just do, do, do-do. Play the beat, touch it, touch it. Baby, I'll have your honour served to me on a platter. Oh baby, yeah! Your Oh baby, yeah! Your Oh baby, yeah! Your Mom said not to do. I feel shy, what to do? What you doing to me? I myself do-do. How do I do-do-do-do? No touch you-touch you-touch-you. How do I save my honour being served on a platter. Your Oh baby, yeah! Your Oh baby, yeah! Your Oh my! Mom said not to do. I feel coy, what to do? Some things I do myself. The rest you do. Come closer, darling, just do, do, do-do. No do-do-do. No do-do-do. No, no, no touch you-touch you-touch-you. How do I save my honour being served on a plate. One little seed, two little seed. Another do on that do. A blemish on your honour, served on a platter. Honour served on a platter. I... l... You... Meenaxi Please stay. Do not go. Will you please come with me? This factory belonged to my father. He passed away four years ago... ...and I've been managing it since. I mean, it functions on its own... ...I just keep a watch. My... ...mother doesn't like to see me painting. She wants me to get a job abroad... ...or stay here and expand this factory. But I don't know anything else. I'm happy only when I paint. So I attend college in the morning. Paint in the afternoons. And handle this place at night. And you? Do you like yourjob? Who's in your family? My mother-father, grandma. And a younger brother. But these days they're too keen on getting me out of the house. What? Lts nothing. By the way, I asked about you in the college... I am so sorry. Yes, I know. I drink... No, never. I don't have the time or the money. I stay alone and never give anyone any explanation. I... Everyone I asked... I mean... Why did you ask others? You should've asked me. I'll drop you home. What's wrong? - Nothing? Sit. Mom! Dad! She's my future wife! Oh my God. Good. Good. All the arrangements are in place. Good. The relatives are here. Good. So why not... start our engagement right now. Yes! Musicians. Start! Nana. Nana, what's going on? And... And where's Meenakshi? You went to get her. So who is this? Madhav. I understand what you're saying? But who is she? We want to see her face. No, no. No, no. She will show her face... ...only after the engagement. And... tell her name only after the engagement. Mom, dad. You'll be happy to know... ...that her parents, who live abroad... ...have promised to give me a sum of 10 million... ...for my 'Dog House' project. I don't drink. I don't drink. I don't drink. I don't drink either, I don't drink either, I don't drink either. Two sober people, on an empty road... ...in a empty city, on an old scooter... ...which gives a faint smell of petrol. I got 50% in my tenth exam. Oh my! I scored 49.60. That's it. Stop here. I'll manage it from here. Thank you for dropping me... - It's alright. Oh my! - She is running away. Catch her. Madhav. Meenaxi You've been following me for the past few days. You turn up everywhere I go. Why? What does it mean? I... l... I... You followed me as soon as I left college today. And you were standing under my house till evening. I don't know why you're doing all this? And then you said your family... ...wants to get you out of the house. And mine wants someone to enter. I mean my mother wants someone to come home. She wants a daughter-in-law that's smart... ...and never scared of anyone. And she's willing to go anywhere she wants at anytime! Oh my! 'I like dark people and not fair.' 'Teach me how to say that.' My handkerchief. What are you doing? My... Where did... Where did... I'll tell you. That's how you say it in Tamil. Oh my! Yes! Yes! Yes! Celebration. Lord of the Ring. Show us your face now, daughter-in-law. Meenaxi - Madhav. Where were you? Are you fine? Didn't I tell you... Meenakshi will be back soon. And who is this with you? Dad, he's... Mom, he's Surya. Meenakshi! - Mynah! What are you doing here? And weren't you supposed to get engaged today? Look. I got engaged too. He's my husband... Nana. Husband? Is she drunk? Nana. - What's going on here? Nana. When did you meet Mynah? And... wasn't today my engagement? Surya. Congrats. - Thank you. Stay happy. And don't forget... ...to watch the films I suggested you. And... don't ever forget that we're always good friends... ...and we'll always be. - Meenaxi Those Rose Day dialogues don't work here. I'm sure we'll cross ways again in life. Stay happy. Thank you, Madhav. I'll take your leave. What now? I... want to marry your daughter. Mom. Dad. I like Surya. And now I know him really well. I'll be happy with him. Surya's a great painter. And consider that we... ...we will stay really happy. I've observed him from all sides. I liked everything about him. His height, his chest, His eyes... ...his hair, his house... What else do I say, mother? I'm feeling so sleepy. Give us your blessings. Tell me fast. - Meenaxi I want to get engaged to Surya. If you two are happy... ...then there's nothing else we want. And anyway, we can't make out... ...whether this is a dream or reality. Whether it's day or night. Everything that's happening since last night... ...is beyond my understanding. It's not a dream, dad. It's reality. And it's a wonderful reality. Mom, dad. Please give us your blessings. Whatever's written in our destiny. Can never be averted. The groom's from down south.
