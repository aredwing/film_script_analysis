Wait, there's someone here. - No no, baby, don't stop. - Someone's here. Baby, don't stop, no. Baby, baby, baby. Baby, there's nobody fucking here. There's nobody here, baby. Hey sexy. Hey. I'm sorry. I tried. I just couldn't do it anymore. Oh baby, you were great. I felt ridiculous all dressed up like that. You have no idea. What? You have no idea how incredibly fucking hot you looked. Ken. I hope Marco's flight wasn't delayed. It's been years since I've seen him. Ugh. Who's that? It's a text from Claire. Looks like she's stuck at the office all weekend... some big deal or something. Oh, that's too bad. I thought they'd really hit it off. Don't worry about Claire not coming. - Really? - I've got this whole thing planned out. I can't believe your boss is trusting you with the boat for the weekend, you big hotshot. - I just want one thing. - What's that? I want you in the red dress. Wait a sec. What? - What is it? - This is for you. Thanks. Babes, thank you. I've always wanted one of these. Open it up. Forever. Oh. Marco. You made it. Great to see you. You're looking... you're looking great. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Thank you. You look pretty good too. All this traveling really suits you. Really? Oh. Oh. It's been way too long. Yeah, five years since college. I'm sorry. Ken, this is Marco. Good to meet you, mate. Nice to meet you too. Yeah, sorry we're late. Me and Rach had to make a little pit stop. Hey, no problem. I haven't worn a watch in two years. No one ever told you that time is money? You want to pay close attention to the map. You don't want to hit any rocks. Is this really the island from "The Odyssey"? It's possible. You never know. This is a very ancient part of the world. Baby, what the fuck's he talking about? Greek mythology. Didn't you see "Clash of the Titans"? The siren's song pulls the sailors towards the rocky shores. So beautiful, but very very dangerous. That's why Odysseus has his crew plug their ears with wax. Yeah, I thought they tied him to the mast. And he told them, no matter how hard he begged, not to untie him until they were far away from the island. What are you doing? Hey. - Aye aye, mate. - Bon voyage. - See you Monday. - See you Monday. I promise I won't drown. Amazing boat. One of the partners let us have it for the weekend. They usually use it for clients. They love showing off. Their parties get kind of crazy. Sounds like he's doing okay. They love him. You wouldn't believe how much they're paying him. And this villa we're going to is absolutely stunning. What about you? - Me? - Yeah. I'm great. So when's the wedding? I'm working on it. You know, I never pictured it quite like this. What do you mean? I always thought, you know... You're the one that got away. Now come help me with lunch. All right, Captain? Too bad Claire couldn't come along though, man. She's fucking hot. Oh really? Yeah, quite the free spirit. I'm just happy to be with you guys. So how is this traveling-the-world thing going for you? Have you managed to find yourself yet? I'm working on it. You know, sometimes you need some distance to see what's right in front of you. This boat is amazing. A lot of money to be made with these guys, man. And they know how to party. - Oh yeah? - Oh yeah. I like to hear that. The road to enlightenment is definitely paved with excess. That's what I'm talking about, yeah. You want to do me a favor and take over for a while? Yeah, sure. Straight ahead? And where are you going? You just set the controls for the heart of the sun. Will do. Ken. Whoo! Ken. Ken. Ken? What the fuck? Turn us around. - Somebody's in trouble. - What? It's too fucking shallow. Somebody needs our help over there. Hey. Who the fuck is that? Whoa whoa, are you okay? Whoa whoa, hey, are you okay? Hey, what happened? - Oh relax. - What's going on? - What the fuck is he saying? - I don't know. I can't understand him. Take it easy. Qu'est-ce qui se passe? - God, he's bleeding from his ears. - He can't hear us. Hey hey, rela... hey hey hey. Hey, don't do that. Hey, don't do that, hey. Hey, whoa whoa. Okay, relax. Okay okay. Mayday mayday mayday. This is Persephone, Persephone, Persephone. Calling all stations. In need of immediate assistance. Over. Try another channel. There's nothing, all right? There's still no signal. Rach, there's no signal 'cause we're in the middle of fucking nowhere. Oh well, thanks for reminding me. It seems to be completely blocked up. Fuck. It's completely silted up. What are we gonna do? Well, there's a box of spare parts down below. I guess I could fix it, but it's gonna take a while. Maybe we can flag someone down. Yeah. First we gotta do something about this. It's not our fault. Rach, we're foreigners in a strange country. Think about it. We don't even know who the fuck he is. They hang people for shit like this, right? Yeah, he's right. Let's take him back ashore. That's where he came from. That's where the fuck he will stay. Someone's here. - What? - Someone's here. Where? Hey! Hey! Wait! Where are you, Rachel? - Rach, where are you? - Rachel! It's okay. It's okay. We're not gonna hurt you. Do you speak English? We didn't know what to do. He just died on our boat. Do you understand? Was he your friend? I'm Rachel. What's your name? Silka. Hi, Silka. What happened? What are you doing out here? I don't remember. That man... who was he? You came back for me? We're gonna help you. Yeah. Is there anybody else here? I don't know. - Who was that man? - I don't remember. You must think. Come on, try and remember. Think. No. Maybe you should take a break. Who were you with? Ken. Can I talk to you for a minute? It's okay. Don't worry about it. You're probably still in shock. I'm gonna fix you something to eat. What is your problem? She's just a girl. She's a witness, okay? She saw us. And you're acting like we're guilty of something. I just want to know what the fuck is going on. She doesn't remember anything. No no no no, there's something that she's not telling us. She's traumatized. Look, let's just take it slow, okay? There you go. Oh, you like that one? I designed it myself. I had it made when I was over in Goa. Have you ever been there? Well, it's completely wild. Silka... I was out of line earlier. I shouldn't have reacted that way to you. I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on here. Okay, so what's the plan? We're gonna go ashore and make camp, set up a signal fire, try and flag somebody down. Besides, it'll be fun. We should get started. It's getting late. So weird... that's completely dead. Help me. Help me. Are you okay? What is it? You remember something. Oh. Don't worry. It'll come back. It's all right. How is it going up there, dude? What's the matter? Is she still up there upset at me? No, not at all. I'm just looking for a bit more fuel for the fire. You got an opener anywhere? You know, I do actually. Did Rachel give you this? What made you guess? "Forever"...is that how long you're gonna make her wait? Well, if I were you, I wouldn't leave her dangling for too long. What are you trying to say? No, nothing. No, nothing? Are you trying to steal my girl? Is that what this is all about for you, huh? - No. - No? No. I'm just fucking with you. Come on, let's get this party started, eh? Hey baby. You look like you could use a drink. I can't stop thinking about that man. What do you think happened to him? Well, probably a fisherman whose boat ran into trouble, you know. And Silka... I'd say she's just a tourist that got stranded. What do you think? He was bleeding from his ears. Rach, Rach, hey, it wasn't our fault, okay? You can't keep thinking about it. We're just gonna deal with it the best way we can. Besides, look on the bright side. A man died here today. I mopped up his blood. Which is why you gotta stop dwelling on it. Look, we're gonna be heroes, okay? We're rescuing a survivor. We've got plenty of supplies. Tomorrow I promise we'll flag somebody down. But let's just enjoy ourselves tonight. Okay? Okay. You're right. Maybe I do need that drink. That's the spirit. Think of it like an adventure. It's kind of like what we spoke about. What do you mean by that? You gotta admit she's pretty hot. What did you just say? Is that what this is for you... some kind of fantasy trip? I just... Her parents are probably worried sick. Maybe it'll help her remember who she really is. You're sick. Rach, I'm just... I'm just kidding around. Rach. Just here is good, guys. We've got a view out to sea, good sight lines. Hey man, looks like someone's been here before. Yeah, that's a good thing, I guess. We've got loads more stuff. Let's go. Hey, where are you guys going? How old do you think she is? Old enough. Hey, where are you guys going? Wait up. Come on, wait for us. It's really weird... I recognize this place. Jesus, Rach. Hey, are you okay? I think so. Okay, her color is coming back. I think you're gonna be fine, yeah? Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. Think you can make it back to the boat? Yeah, no, I'm okay. Really, I'm fine. Are you sure? Hey hey. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. It's fine. Let's get you in some dry clothes, hmm? I'll start the fire. Hi. Guys! Silka. Where are you? Marco! Marco, where are you? Where are you? She wants you. Marco, where are you? Marco! We're coming. Marco! Where have you been? Well, you can't just go running off like that. We're supposed to stick together. What's wrong? Huh? No no, I can't. I can't. I... Yeah, I'd better go and bring the gear up. God, it's so beautiful here. What's wrong? Do you remember something? Sorry, I didn't mean to... I'm just so happy now. There's a man all alone in the middle of the woods. There's a knock at the door. And he goes and he answers the door. And there's a big burly Scottish lumberjack standing there. And he says, "Hi, my name's Angus. I've come to invite you to a party." The man says, "That's great. What kind of party?" And Angus says, "Oh, you know, the usual... a bit of fightin', a bit of drinkin', a bit of dancin', a bit of fuckin'." The man says, "That sounds interesting. How many people are gonna be there in all, you know?" And Angus says, "Oh, there'll just be the two of us." Come on, baby. Come on. That's the spirit. Who wants to play charades? Yeah. No, we're not playing charades. Silka. I'll break your heart To keep you Far from where All dangers start And atmosphere Gets crazy life Where every breath Just bites Into the soul Space so calm about you I'll break your heart To keep you Far from where All dangers start I'm on my way I'm on my Way Down. Wow. What a voice. Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Yah! Are you seeing this? If this is a dream, I don't want to wake up. It's so beautiful here. Look at the stars. Wow. Where's Marco? He went to the... Maybe we should go back in. What's the rush? I'm cold. We'll keep you warm. Right, Silka? Hey. Don't start without me. Huh? Marco? There's somebody here. Where is he going? You came back for me? No, I can't. Yes, you can. Silka. She wants you, Marco. Fuck! Oh, Jeez. Silka. No! No! She asked for it. It's all up here. Ken. Come on, man, I'm not fucking around. Say something! What the fuck? Oh shit! I warned you. You're fucking dead. I fucking buried you. What? It's inside you. What the fuck's inside me? Get the f... oh no! Stay the fuck away from me. We must cut it out. No! Marco! Rachel! Get the fuck... Marco! Oh shit. Dude, what the fuck have you done? Where's Ken? No idea. Well, where is he? Everything was just so fucked up last night. It was like I was having a bad trip or something. Where have you been? Ken. We have to leave now. Get everything together. We gotta get back in the boat. - Why? You said... - Listen! I found another body. What? I think he maybe have been with the other guy. Oh my God. What the fuck's so funny? Is this all a joke to you? Hey hey, do you have something that you want to share with the rest of us? Please share it. What the fuck's so funny? You think you're the hero, but you're not. What the fuck is wrong with you, huh? What the fuck is wrong with you? Don't you want to get off this island? Don't you want to get off the island? Ken! You're going to die here. Nobody's coming to save you. Nobody. Silka. Let her go. We can't just leave her here. Yes, we can. I'm not leaving without her. Silka! Silka. Silka. Hey guys, look over here! There's more. Shit. They're everywhere. Fuck. What the fuck is that? Whoa. Fuck. Fuck. Okay okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. I think there's something down here. What is it? Decking. What the fuck is that smell? Don't. What is it? It's bodies... lots of dead bodies. No no no no. This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. - Rachel. - This isn't real. This isn't real. - Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. - This isn't real! This isn't real! It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's okay. I don't understand. Where is she? Where is Silka? It doesn't matter, all right? Hey, we're leaving. We're getting out of here. Okay? Trust me. Yeah? Okay okay. We must get back to the boat. I'll break your heart To keep you Far from where And atmosphere Gets crazy life Where every breath Just bites Into the soul Space so calm about you I'll break your heart To keep you far... I'm on my way I'm on my Way Down. What are you doing? Nothing. Okay, there's a lot more stuff. Let's go. I don't understand. I've changed the valve. It should be clear. Is that working? I think so. That's moving. That's moving. There you go. Ugh. Mayday mayday mayday. This is Persephone, Persephone, Persephone. Can anyone hear me? Over. Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is Persephone, Persephone, Per... Is that moving? Yeah yeah, just... Rachel. Silka? Rachel. Silka, I'm here. Silka, can you hear me? Rachel. Silka, I can... I'm... Help me. Okay. One, two, three! Almost! Try it again! Oh fuck. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel. One, two, three! Is that it? Is that it? Yeah! - Yeah, baby! - All right! Whoo! We're out of here. Rach, Rachel. Rach. Hey baby. Baby, are you in there? Rach. Rach. Help me. Rachel. I'm waiting. Rachel, please. Help me. Help me. Help me. Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. I'm waiting. I'm waiting. Over here, Rachel. Come to me. Rach. This way. Over here. Come to me. Rachel, Rachel. Oh. Rachel, Rachel. Where the fuck are we going? Rachel. You belong here. Rachel. Hey. What the hell are you doing? I found Silka. Hey, listen. Hey, that's enough, okay? The boat's fixed. We're gonna leave here. No no no, wait wait. Silka! Silka! Rach, Rach, Rach. - Sil... - Hey, she's gone, okay? No no, she was here. Baby, she made a choice. We're leaving. Guys, this way. - Help me. - Rachel, come on. Help me. Wait. Rachel. Guys, come on. Rachel, come on. Where the fuck are we? - I'm waiting. - Rach, Rachel, come on. Please. Rachel. Help me. Rach, come on. If we just follow this way, we'll get to the north. For fuck's sake. Marco, come on. Just follow me, all right? We're just going around in circles. Haven't we already been this way? Come on, we need a rest. What's going on? Ken, can you please just listen to him? Marco, I'm trying to get us the fuck out of here. Marco. It's all up here. I'll break your heart. It's all up here, man. Guys, I think I know what's going on. What are you talking about? She hypnotized us. It was the song, man. None of this is really happening. Stop it, Marco. Stop it. It's all up here. It's all up here, man. What is? Rachel knows. Rachel's known all along. Marco, get a grip, eh? Marco. We're all in it together. Marco... Marco? Marco? Marco, where have you gone? Marco! Rach, Rach. Rach, hey Rach, wait wait. He's gone. He was just behind me. Rach, we've got to keep moving. Where? Where are we going? I know how to get off this island. Okay? We can do this together. - Okay. - Okay. Okay okay. Wait. Just in case. Okay. It took me a while, but I finally figured it out. It's all in here. Shh. I'll break your heart To keep you Far from where All dangers start And atmos... Mine! Crazy life Where every breath Just bites... Oh shit. Oh, here. My foot. My foot's stuck. Here, let me help. Rach, Rach, I need my hand. It's okay. Ken? Ken! Ken! Ken! Rachel! Ken! Rachel. Ken! Rachel, Rachel, I found it. Silka, I know you can hear me. I know you can. Please just... just let him go. Just... I'll do anything. Silka! Marco, Marco. Jesus, Marco. What the fuck happened, man? Silka. It's all up here. Rachel! Rachel! Ken. - Can you hear me? - Ken. - Rach! - Ken! - Rachel. - Oh. - Rachel. - Oh honey. I thought I lost you. No, you're not getting rid of me that easy. I found the water. We're gonna get out of here, okay? You're covered in blood. It's Marco's. Where every breath just bites... What are you doing? She did this. What do you mean? Let's go. Silka did this. What? Can't you hear her? I'll break your heart We've got to stop the singing. We're like the... the sailors in that ship... they put wax in their ears. That's how they stopped the singing. That's enough. You can have me if you let him go. We don't need him. I'm the one you want. I'm the one. We have each other now. I'll break your heart To keep you Far from where... I'll break your heart. I've always loved you. I love you too. Forever? Forever. Forever. You catch her dangerous eyes Her silhouette in the smoky music Shift around the drunken hall When I pull you near Love poison's in your blood The heat is rising up You've been called, hypnotized By a rattlesnake siren Shut down, shut down Shut down, rattlesnake Shut down, shut down Before the night comes in Shut down, shut down Shut down, rattlesnake Shut down, shut down Before the night comes in Shut down, shut down Shut down, rattlesnake Shut down, shut down Shut down, rattlesnake Shut down, shut down Shut down, rattlesnake Shut down, shut down Before the night comes in.
