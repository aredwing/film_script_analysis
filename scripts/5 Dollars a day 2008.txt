You may see a curious old person, but I see a good-looking older guy who's making the system work for him. I do quite well, you know, in my modest way. It's sort of monkish. AII I need is my bowI. I go from village to village, tapping with my stick. Who taught you how to drive? You're a terrible driver. You're a lot like me. Nat. - Hey. - Huh? - You all right. - Yeah. Food. Let's eat.

Though, I can't say I didn't think about it. Mm. Just never met a man who was so in love with his wife. I used to sit on my front porch and watch them dance in the living room. I can't say, If thlngs weren't dlfferent, I wouldn't have... The man deserved a little love and affection. Why? Because of the way she treated him. What are you talking about? He drove her away. He didn't drive her away. Yes, he dld. I don't know what he told you, but she left him for another man. What? That candy-ass that she used to work for at the car dealership. What, Kruger? No, no, no, no, no, no. She did not. I would've known. Everybody in the town knew, Flynn. Nearly broke that man in two. You were just a kld. And of course, Kruger moved on to greener pastures. And, you know... She died. Probably shouldn't have told you. It's okay. I'm sorry. Your coffee, ma'am. Hey. Ow! Are you all right? Hey, can we get some napkins here? Oh. What happened? He very nearly burned me to death. Please, ma'am, anything that we can do to solve the problem, we'll be more than happy to. There is. And you will be hearing from me. You will. And it will not be for a refill. He saw it. Did you see it? Yes, yes. Would you take me home? What are you, kidding? Get a lawyer. I didn't- So I got my Mercedes with a trip and a slip at the supermarket last year. This? This ought to be worth 5 grand and maybe a new wardrobe. Well, in that case, you don't mind if I ask for my 20 dollars back, do you? Nat! What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing, man? Guys? Sensory dep. It's so soothing. It's better than meditating. Hi, baby. Wah! Hm. Hey. Nighty-night, Flynny. Comfy? Hi. Hey. I got that mattress from that sexuaI harassment thingy, from Price Breakers last summer. A Sealy Posturepedic. The good stuff. Mm-hmm. Nice, huh? It's nice and springy. Yeah, it's a wonderfuI mattress. Mm-hmm. He's not here, you know? He's on the couch. I know. I know. Okay. I'm verklempt. You are one of the most exciting women I've ever been this close to, and normally, I'm a guy who does what comes next, but in this case, at the end of the day, it's too late. No, it's not. It is. I have an idea. How about I give you a supply of calling cards, weekends and holidays? I already have Wow. Is this because I'm dying? This is because you're a good man. I used to be. You still are. Dolores? Yeah, baby? I would deny you nothing, but this is not going to happen, I promise you. It's a fruitless effort. Are you giving up that easy? Oh. Oh... You think this is easy, for me to embarrass myself this way? You should go. No. No. No. Why? The pink briefcase. I've never heard it spoken of in that way before. You gave it to me for my high schooI graduation. That was a souvenir of friendship. I... I didn't even pay for it. You're going to pay for it now, buddy. Mm. Oh, Nat! Dolores. Oh, Dolores. Whoa, golly. Whoa. Yeah. Boom, boom, boom, let's go back to my room. I'll give you another try. You know, don't like good-byes, no tears, no sighs. Thank you. Mighty hunter drive? What do you say to a chow-down after a hard day's night? Pancakes, sausage patties, maple syrup! You worked up an appetite, huh? Mm-hmm. How come you never told me about Kruger? Did I tell you he owes me $2,000? That's what I lent him to open his first car lot, $2,000. And he stiffed me. You know how many showrooms Kruger has as we speak? And still, I haven't seen dime one of my investment. He's not an honorable man. No, no, Kruger and Mom, Kruger and Mom. How could you not tell me? Tell you what? Oh, come on. Make a wish? What was yours, running naked on the beach again? Nah. I already got mine. I wish you weren't sick. You on a diet? It's my cake. It's for you. Thanks. So how you going to stick it to him? What do you mean? Well, that's what we're here for, isn't it? Get back at Kruger? How'd you put that together? I'm your son, aren't I? Let me in on it. Eh. I have to do this by myself. I want to help. Meet me at Dogtown, noonish. Welcome to Kruger Motors. Beauty, isn't she? Interested in a test drive? No, thanks. I have a meeting with BK. Nat Flynn. He's very busy today. It could be a while. I'm early. Is there a place to sit, maybe some tea? Thanks. Nat. Bert. Sit down. Thanks. Long time, no see. Not long enough. A lot of spilt milk under the bridge for the both of us, I'm sure. How's your family? Children and your wife? They're great. Bert junior must be in college by now. Michigan. Yeah, your alma mater. Kudos. Let's get down to it, Nat. Sure. Nice-looking boy. He's all rlght. No chick magnet, not like us. First time they handed him to met at the hospitaI, I got scared. What am I going to do with a screaming, red-faced kid? But three seconds later, I was in love with him. I wish I hadn't felt that way. It should've been you, Bert. Look, Nat- I understand you've got a beautifuI thing here, terrific family, new career. I'm not here to upset any of that. AII I care about is him. I want him to have something, a nest egg for when I'm gone. I haven't been able to do that for him, but you could. Or we have to do this in court. And then it's a public thing. How do I know that in six months, you're not going to show up on my front porch, Nat? I'm not going to be here six months from now, Bert. Look, check with my oncologist. His number's on the back, if you want. What about the kid? He doesn't know. At this time of my life, the last thing I want is to tell him I'm not his father. He may be a disaster, but he's all I've got. It pains me to say this, but there's something wrong with him, Bert. I believe it. It's my fault. You don't look sick, Nat. You haven't changed at all. Sam impeccable sense of timing. You know today's the day I announce my candidacy for mayor. Of course, you knew that already. Got us a suite. You going to tell me what happened, or what? I've thought about this day so long, worked it out in my head, and it was nothing. No big deaI. I talked. He listened. He game me the money. That's it. Well, that's good, right? You should be happy. You got your $2,000 back. My money plus 30 years compounded interest adjusted for inflation. $150,000. What is this? You got $150,000 in a plastic- did you steaI this? He gave it to me, and I promise you, he's not coming after it. Why would he give you $150,000? He thinks he's your father. Why does he think he's my father? He took a test. I sent him his own DNA, said it was yours. Well, how'd you get his DNA? Short, curly pubic hair. I don't know. Ask Dolores. Oh, that's- that's disgusting. She's a friend. Top of the menu, right? What do you say we throw the map away and detour down to Vegas? What stays there stays there. Yeah, all right. What's wrong, mopey face, hangdog mopey face? Why would he just roll over? Well, what else was he going to do? I had him boxed in. He's running for mayor. You think his wife and spin doctors want you on the campaign poster? Thanks. No, it's just, he was with Mom. Is that right? So when exactly did that start? I don't know. Was it before I was born? I try not to worry about things I can't do anything about. Excuse me? The thing is, we hit the jackpot, you and me. You play your cards right, you never have to punch a clock. You can start up something permanent with this. It's a nest egg. Are you shitting me? Are you kidding? I know how you feeI, but these last days have been the best time for me in a long time. Oh. Oh, jeez. I wanted us to get to know each other again, and we did. No, you're right. You're right, you're right. I admit it. For some reason, I was starting to enjoy sitting in that stupid car with you all day. But that's worth nothing now, because you're a liar. How could you think that it wouldn't matter to me to know who my father is? Hello? Hey. Give me a straight answer. You're not even dying, are you? The X-ray is from a friend of mine at the zoo. It's the skull bone of a gorilla. All right, well, maybe you're not my father, but ever morning, I wake up, I look in the mirror, and I feeI sick to my stomach because I thlnk I'm turnlng out to be just llke you. Stick a knife in my heart. What's wrong? Where you going with the money? What are you doing? So glve me a number. How much more is this going to cost me? I don't want your money. Why have you come? I wanted to get a look at you. I wanted to get a look at you too. You're not what I expected. But then again, I bet Nat painted me as the bad guy too, didn't he? Something like that. Look, I already have a son. But I might be willing to make an arrangement with you. Not out in the open, of course. But I could get you a job in sales. We're opening a new dealership in Reno. So you're my father. I suppose we ought to get a legitimate blood test. I got to assume Nat's hustling me. Why'd you pay him? Guilt. Pity. I wanted hlm to feel llke he'd pulled off something big for once in his life. You know, a big score. Look... after the election, you get in touch with me. I really have to be getting back. Okay, can I ask you a question? Did you love her? You know what women are like. You say something in the heat of the moment. Do you mean it? They think it's forever. Honey? You're keeping some very important people waiting. Can you see your way out? Saw my way in. Serlously, I wlll turn the mlc over to Tom. Tom, what do you have to say about Bert Kruger? He's a man of honor and Integrlty, despite being a used car salesman. It would be my honor to support him as the next mayor of this city, especially if I get the discount on that new Caddy. You got it, Tom. Just kidding, Bert. Hi, everybody. I'll be reaI quick. I just wanted to say a few words about the man I've just discovered is my father, Mr. Kruger. Dad... I just wanted to say how great it is to finally meet you and to see what I've been missing all this time. I was in jaiI. And about that $150,000 that you paid to get rid of me, I don't want it. I hate bribes. Hold it! Mr. Kruger, slr, you've just been accused of paying hush money to an ex-con who claims to be your son. Do you have any comments, sir? Yes, this is dirty tricks by Terrance Bissen, my opponent. Is that a deniaI, sir? It's a categoricaI deniaI. Excuse me. Thank you very much. Did you give him the money? How could you do that? What have you done? You gave back $150,000. Am I rlght? Did you give him the money? Yes or no? Come on. You ralsed me better than that. Vegas, here we come. Hey, Nat? How about we head down to L.A. after? I want you to meet Maggie. Nat? Nat? Hi. I'm in a hospitaI in Albuquerque. It's Nat. And it turns out, this is the first time in his life he's telling the truth. And... he's dying. He really is dying. So... That's... what I wanted to tell you. Bye. Hello? Hi. Could I get another tapioca, please? You've got a sweet tooth. I do. Closer. Let me feeI your face. I'm sorry. We did good, though. We got copasetic. We're not done yet. Come here. Get me out of here. Hi. Thanks for coming. Well, nobody ever flew me first class before. I do what I can. Your mustache. You want me to grow it back or what? I won this place in a card game a long time ago. I figured, one day, you'd come here and bring the girI of your dreams, like I did. Oh, somebody's been here. I don't remember the place being such a dump. We were a family once. You wanted a boat? Thank you. Just so you know, if I could do it again, I'd have been more like a dad, tossed a ball, pitched a tent, taught you to drive. You did teach me to drive. Come on. Uncle Al- No, you did. You did. In the parking lot behind St. PauI's Church when I was 11. You're right. How could I do a thing like that? Come on. There's something we got to do. Well, I spent my whole life wanting a different kind of a father, one who would look after me instead of me looking after him. And instead, I got this infantile, irresponsible, uncivilized, cheap, jive-talking bullshit artist. And now that I'm rid of you, here... Here I am wanting you back. It's typicaI. Oh, and you'd be happy to know that urn was free with $5 of gas. I'm gonna miss you, Dad. We're sinking. Oh, come on. What do we do? What do we do? Hey, grab that metaI cup right there. It's coming in fast. BaiI, baiI, baiI, baiI! Why don't you row? BaiI! You got to be shitting me, Nat! Row! Oh, what did I do? Oh, my God. Help! Help! It's not funny.
