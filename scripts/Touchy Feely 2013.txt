Will you marry me? The upstairs toilet is acting funny. What? Upstairs toilet is acting funny. Mm. Have you noticed? No, I guess I haven't really noticed. It was making a running sound, like, even... even when it wasn't... - Okay. - ... just when it was not in use. And then it would stop. Okay, well, did you look in the back? Like, did you look in the tank of the toilet? Mm-mm. Sometimes the chain just falls off. And you just reattach it. Is there... is there anything that... No, no, everything is... everything's under control. Okay, then. I'll get it. - Hey, Paul. - Hey. Good to see you. Yeah, I beat my record by, like, two minutes. - Oh. - Uh... Aw, man. Is everybody in the kitchen? Are you out of your mind? A calzone is not the same as a Hot Pocket. Okay, what's the difference, then? - There's a huge difference. - Okay, what's the difference? Okay, you've got your tomato-based filling and you've got your pastry-based outer shell. Hold on, have you ever even had a calzone? Yes, I've had a calzone. I got a pizza and I flipped it over and I called it a calzone. You know what we're gonna do? I am going to make you a calzone. - Okay. - And you're gonna eat it and then I'm gonna prove you wrong and you're gonna owe me. Okay, deal. What do you owe me? - I don't know. - What's he gonna owe me? What should I owe her? I don't know. How about... how about a beer? Okay. I'll get it. And if it turns out to be like a DiGiorno's Pizza that's just folded over and thrown in the oven, what do I get out of it? Well, I mean, regardless, you're gonna get a delicious homemade treat, so... - What? The calzone? - Yeah. - That's the treat? - That's the treat. Oh, God. Okay. And what happens if I don't like it? Then what do I get out of it? Nothing. That's just... that's just not possible. A homemade treat. Time's up! - Hi, babe. - Hi. Mmm! - Mmm, that smells good. - Brought wine. - Hi, baby. - Just put it here. I remembered the salad dressing. Why didn't you make the one that you make? - The one... - I didn't have any time. The one that you make is so good. Just tell me next time and I'll make it. Well, then you would know my secret recipe. Oh, oh, I didn't realize. Mmm, the stew smells amazing. What is that? - Is it cinnamon? - Will you take this? - What is that? - Beef. Beef stew. I know, but what's that smell? Clove? It's just beef. So, did you get them in? The applications? I didn't send them. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. What the fuck? Why? What the fuck? Give me a break. What do you mean, give you a break? Why didn't you send them? It's, like, a really bad time. - It's a great time. - No, it's not a great time. Why? We can barely pay Susan, okay. What does that mean? What do you mean, what does it mean? It means that we haven't had a new client in forever and all of Grandpa's clients are dying off. Yeah, and that's not your problem. Yeah, well, that's really easy for you to say. Yeah, it is easy for me to say. And it's easy for you to say, too. You don't get it. Look, I love you. It's your life. It's your life. I have to go to the bathroom. Should I cook these tomatoes or does it matter? Doesn't matter. Dad, will you get the corn bread? - Hey. - Hey. Mmm. Do you think this is such a hot idea? Yeah. I think it's an incredibly hot idea. - Are you sure? - Yeah. You look wan. - Wan? - Mm-hmm. Are you sleeping? You've got bags. - You're all puffy. - Yeah, I'm sleeping. I think he looks okay. I should have Bronwyn make an elixir for him. Mm-hmm. I have a friend who makes these incredible energy tonics that stimulate everything... your liver, your gallbladder, your kidneys... I don't think that elixirs are Dad's thing. Well, maybe not... What does it taste like? - It tastes like shit. - Garbage. But so good for you. Cleansing, healing. Bronwyn's amazing. She did Reiki on me last month. It was incredible. - Right? - Mm-hmm. You should get Reiki done. Paul, you would love Reiki. - Mm-hmm. What's Reiki? What... what is it? It's energy work, essentially. - Energy work. Helps you release emotional blockages and clear out pathways and just makes you feel awesome in general. Okay. Paul, how's the practice doing? - Great. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Business is booming? Yeah, we're trucking along and... Good, awesome. How's the apartment search going? - Did... - Good. - It's... - You found something? Not yet, but I have a few leads. You have to be out by the first. I know, I know, I know. Well, why don't you just move in with me? I mean, you're at my house every night. - Well, it's not every night. - Just about every night. I mean, rent's really high right now, you know. I mean, it just makes sense. Or... you could move in here until... you find a place that's suitable. There's plenty of room. The door is always open to you. Thank you, brother. That is a very generous offer, Paul. - Um... - Thank you. I mean, it makes sense, right? That's what I'm saying. - Right? - Yeah. I mean, you're going to regret it, though, because I'm a complete and utter slob. Like I already don't know that. I know, but once all my stuff is there... - All right. - So you'll move in. - Yeah. - That's great. And you guys can have dinner at our house. Here we go. Tap, tap, tap. Hold closed and grind side to side for me. Perfect. And let's get our front. Tap, tap, tap. One, two, three. Hold it closed. Grind side to side. Perfect. All right. Mirror. All right, Mrs. Elvsted, let's just take a look and see what we've got here. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, Mrs. Elvsted, so be sure to floss. We'll see you next time. Who's next? Um, no one today. Mrs. Koppleson canceled. Dad? Yeah? I was thinking, um... I think we need some new blood. We could advertise. That's too expensive. We have to... we have to spend money to make money, right? I could call around. I could... I could do some research. Who would you call? I don't know. Look at bus ads or call some newspapers. I'm not comfortable with that. Okay. You feel good. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Oh, it's amazing. Ah! So, what are his... what are your brother's symptoms? Oh, um, he's really uptight. - Drink this. - Thank you. He's judgmental, he's rigid and... I don't want a character assassination, - I just want his symptoms. - Oh. He's, um... he's really, uh, depleted. His, like, energy is gone. - He's all sucked in and wan and... - Okay. ...he's not sleeping good. I'll give him a liver tonic and throw in - something for gallbladder. - Okay. And have him come see me, why don't you? All right. That's not gonna happen, but all right. He really should. I can help him better if he's... And what about you? How are you doing? You feel good, so things are good. What? Jesse asked me to move in with him. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Last night in front of my family at dinner. - Wow. - Yeah. - Wow. No joke? - What the F, right? That's... did you... are you... you're... Yeah. I mean, ugh, I don't know. - Yes, good, good. - I'm kind of flipping out about it. Well, of course you are. You wouldn't be you if you didn't flip out about it. It's great, it's fine. It's normal, it's normal. - Really? - Yes. I mean, he was supposed to be my rebound, you know. - Yeah. - Just my get-back-in-the-game guy. Yeah, and look what happened. Isn't it awful? - Something beautiful happened. - Is it? To actually have a... - Is it? Yes. - I don't know. Is being tied down again gonna be awesome or is it gonna be like a cage and like... No. Honey, I keep telling you, I've always told you, you have something that, yes, started sexually. Mm-hmm. And it's grown into something beautiful. That's what happened for me and Charlie. We started out that way and that was the most meaningful relationship of my entire life. And you know what? I didn't even appreciate what I had until Charlie passed. It wasn't until after. And I... I... I just don't want you to fuck it up. I don't want you to fuck it up. All right. - Just appreciate. - Mm-hmm. Okay? - All right, cheers. - Gratitude. - Gratitude and appreciate. - I adore you. What time's your first victim? - Oh, 10 minutes ago. - Okay. Here, take these, take these. I mixed these for you. This is my special blend, very proud of that. - Love it. - I'll bring the tonic down later, okay? Thank you. You're a rock star. Oh, and I will put your check in the box. Oh, yeah. Two months. I know, two months. I'm sorry. - Can I help you? - Um, yeah. Jenny sent me. She said I could get a free cleaning. Oh. Uh, okay. - Um, Jenny. - - Oh, Henry. - Hey. - You came. Yeah, it's okay. Come back. Okay. - Okay, you ready? - Yeah. All right. Open up. Wait, what... what are you doing? - Oh, hey, Dad. - Hi. This is Henry. He... we know each other from Cafe Fiore. - Hello. - Hello. You know each other how? Oh, I work there. He makes my coffee every morning. Oh. Yeah, I just figured that the chair was empty, so I'd just give him a quick polish. What do you mean? Well, I didn't want to bother you, you know. He's my friend. I was just doing him a favor. He hasn't had a cleaning in a while. That's not right. What do you mean? You don't have the training. Yeah, but I've seen you do it, like, a thousand times. Well, I think it'd be better if you stayed on your side. Don't you? So, when was the last time you saw a dentist? - About five years ago. - Oh, five... well, you're due. G3. The mirror. Okay, let's open up and take a look. All right, what have we got going on here? Uh-huh. I'm gonna start you facedown under the top sheet and you can hang your things here. - I'll see you in a second. - All right, thanks. All right, thank you. - Does it feel warm enough in here? - Uh-huh, it's nice. Good. I'll start with light pressure at first, okay? You tell me if you want me to adjust it. Okay. Hey. Hey. How's it going? Okay. How's your day? Shitty. Well, why don't you come over here and I'll give you a back rub? Aw. That sounds nice. It's tempting, but... I have so much packing to do. Oh, okay. Um, I'll see you tomorrow, then? Yeah. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I'm just, uh... I don't know. I'm just in a funky mood or something. I'll call you in the morning, okay? Call me when you get up. I will. I love you. Me, too. - 'Night. - All right, good night. E3. - Dad, he's, like, totally freaking out. - Mirror. He loves you. He says you cured him. I cured him of what? - Well, he had this... - Open, please. ...horrible pain. It was in his jaw. - TMJ? - Yeah. Temporomandibular joint disorder. - Right, right. - Open, please. It was so bad that he had to stop singing. And since he left the office, I mean, he's had no pain. My granddaughter has TMJ. Maybe you could cure her. Well, that's doubtful, Mrs. Olsen. But if she comes in, I'd be happy to take a look. All right, let's open, please. All right. All right. I hate to disappoint you, but if you came here hoping that I could somehow magically take away your pain, I can't do that. Okay. I understand. Do you? Yes. Just do whatever you did for the last guy, the guy that you cured. I didn't cure him. Okay. Just so long as you understand. Okay. Okay, and open, and... Mr... What happened? Word of mouth. Mr. Harris? Right this way. Hi, this is Abby. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I will not be seeing any clients for the time being. I'm sorry for any inconvenience that this causes anybody and I hope to be back soon. Namaste. And Abby came running in here. Grandpa Douglas had just mixed a batch of this. Boom. And everywhere. It was all over his face. I was sitting right where you are, giggling. And, I mean... Oh, my gosh! Look what else came. Look what you are doing for people. I don't understand it. It's not like I'm doing anything differently. Oh. - Henry's singing again. Well, that's great, but I'm not responsible for that. He thinks you are. Here. All right. Look. "To my favorite dentist. " "To family dentistry. " I'm gonna take the car out for a bit. - Oh, hey, Henry. - Hey, Jenny. Did you come back to see my dad again? Um, well, both of you, actually. I, um, wanted to give you tickets to my show. Oh! Oh, wow. Thank you. Thank you. It wouldn't be happening if it weren't for your dad. Well, that's incredible. Thanks. No, it's just a little invite-only thing. - It's no big deal. - No, that's cool. We'll definitely, definitely come. - Cool. - I... Um, I... I made this for you. Oh, is this your music? No, it's just some songs that I thought you'd like. - Thank you. - You're welcome. That's so... that's really sweet. Thanks. Um, I gotta go, but I... I'm really looking forward to this. - Cool. - Thank you. I'll see you there. Brandon said he's headed down to the Galway. - Oh, yeah, the Kraken? Kraken, Galway... it's the same thing. He's really heading down there. Hey,Jesse. Jenny, hey. - Hey. - What are you doing here? I'm good. I'm doing good. - Is that the... - Um, here. It's... well, it's... - it's not a Hot Pocket. - Oh. Wow, that... that is not a Hot Pocket. God, you really didn't... No, I know, but I was... I was gonna... you know, I was gonna do it anyway because I... well, I love to cook and the conversation just sort of inspired it, so... God, this smells great. - I mean... - Good. I feel... No, don't feel... I mean, it was... it's nothing. It's totally not anything, you know. - Thank you. - I will... - Yeah, I'll see you. - Yeah. Hey, Jenny. Thanks. This is really nice. All right, Abby... What? Will you do me a favor? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Will you take your shirt off? What? Will you kiss me? What? Will you kiss me? What the fuck? Abby! There, Reiki, Reiki. "What is Reiki?" That's what Abby's friend does. And, um, how long have you had this pain? Oh, for, like, ever. That's what it feels like, at least. Well, it started in a kind of on-and-off way. Okay. I was still working on the boat, so it was before 1998. Right, right. And, um... then it started to get real bad. Is it on the... right in here? - It's both sides. - Both sides. - Both sides hurt. - Right. So that was before 1998 when it started. And then, uh... - Um... - And then after '98? Yeah... it started getting really bad and really persistent all the time. - Yeah. - You know, and, um... so that was, like, when I got divorced. - So that was back in, like, 2005. - Mm. 2005... right. - Thanks for seeing me. - Oh, yeah. I've heard great things. Well, let's not get our hopes up too high, but we'll see what we can do. The simplest of things Not the least of all my mind... Mind... Close your... ahem. Wow. Okay, what's going on with you? I don't... I don't know. Your energy is... is just completely whopper jawed. You wanna... I just... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I just... I feel really weird. Everything is weird. I don't know. - I... - Weird? Yeah, I just... luau I just... I feel off. Well, your energy is off. It's completely all over the place and incredibly fearful. I feel like I can't... - I don't know. - You can't...? With everything I can't... like, with Jesse I can't... I don't want him to touch me. I can't connect. I don't know how to... I don't know. - Is there something? - Yeah. Too much here. When was the last time you guys went out and just... to, you know...? You love to dance. When was the last time you went dancing? Hiking? I can't. I just... I need you to fix me, please. You can fix yourself. I can't. Maybe you need a physiological trigger. Have you ever tried MDMA? - What, like ecstasy? - Yeah. It's kind of a big deal in certain psychotherapy circles. Are you fucking with me right now? No. Charlie and I tried it. We did it. It was a great way for us to... reconnect. What? I just don't know where I would even get it. Hold on. Wow. I haven't looked there since... Anyway- One for you, one for Jesse. Think of it as a hall pass, a permission slip to just let go of your fear and embrace the world. Or not. Oh, my God! I'm such a jerk. I am so sorry I'm so late. That looks amazing. Where were you? Oh, Bronwyn had a cancellation and I just tried to sneak in, - and it just went way over. - Yeah? But I think she had a really good idea. - What's that? - Look what she gave me. What is that? Ecstasy. - Ecstasy? - Yeah. Awe-awesome. Yeah, I don't know. I thought it could be really good for us right now. Yeah. I kind of want to do it before Paul and Jenny get here, but we should probably wait until after they leave. Probably. What's wrong? Nothing. Ecstasy, huh? What do you think? Abby, I think you're acting a little bit nuts is what I think. Pssh. Why? Abby, we haven't even had a chance to talk about what happened yesterday at the shop. Yeah, I know. I just... I... I mean, come on. What was that? You come in, you take off... and then you just leave? - Yeah. - Imagine how that made me feel. Do you really think that taking drugs right now is what we need to do? I think that's the last thing that we need to do. I think we need to stop and get real with each other for a second. I'm being real with you. Abby, you're an hour and a half late to a dinner that I've been cooking for your family, - which is totally fine... - Yeah. ...but then you waltz in here with drugs in your hand and... I'm sorry, it may be me, but it feels a little bit weird. I don't know. I just thought it would be... What, you need to take some sort of, you know, drugs, to be with me? - Is that where we're at? - No, no. God, no. I just thought it would be fun. I'm just saying, like, you're just acting a little bit different. I know. Is there something going on with you? - I mean... - Yeah. I just wanted to do something that might be fun. I don't know. It's stupid. So stupid. It was a stupid idea. No, it's not stupid. It's just caught me off guard and... - Okay, they're here. - All right, you should go get... You know what? Forget I said anything about it. - It's a stupid idea. - No, it's... it's... Ecstasy. - Hey, guys. - Hi. Yay, salad. Thank you. - Come on in. - I got this wine. Thanks. You guys wanna have a seat? It's kind of incredible, actually. You're, like, changing lives. - No, I'm not. - Yeah, you are. Yeah. Henry, he's gonna... he hasn't performed in, like, two years or something. That's because of you. You should be... you should feel really, really good about that. That's great, Paul. - Done? - Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Jesse's organizing a 30-mile urban bike race downtown. - Oh, come on. - You are. It's a bike ride. More like a ride. - It's not, like, a race. - I thought it was a race. No, it's like a group ride. - Oh, group ride. - Yeah. - That sounds really cool, actually. - Yeah. And what's the point? Fun. Can you pass your plate, please? - That was really, really good. - Thank you. - It was really delicious. - Thank you. How is it being roomies, you guys? Um, I'll let you know when I... when I finish packing. - Somebody's been lazy. - Yeah. - You're not moving in? - I am moving in. This weekend we're gonna tackle it. Just been busy. Oh, Paul, I got you that elixir from Bronwyn. She said she wanted to see you in person, but I told her that was probably never gonna happen. Why did you say that? Because you said you would... I don't know. Here. Her tonic. Knock yourself out. What are these? Ecstasy. - What? Yeah. Are you taking that? Yeah. Why are you taking ecstasy? It's the hug drug, Paul. I'm addicted. I'm actually a fucking drug addict. I wanted to tell you about it. Who wants dessert? Chia seed pudding. That tofu was so... I don't usually like tofu and I just... Oh, thanks. I cooked it in, like, really special olive oil, so... - Oh. - So, like... Welcome. Thank you. So, did you have a particular goal in mind for today? No, just... I'm curious and I... Okay. Just Abby, you know, my sister, she said that it's amazing, so... I think it is. I think you're going to really enjoy it. So why don't we just get started into the session and see where it takes us? - Okay. - okay. I'll take your coat for you. How's the temperature feel in here? Okay? - In here? - Yeah. - It's good. - Okay. Oh, you don't need to remove your clothes for Reiki. I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. - Sorr... no. No, you know what? You're actually... if you're more comfortable, I'd love you to remove your clothes. I mean, if you want to, if you feel comfortable. Mmm... Okay. All right, good. So why don't you just climb on up here and get comfortable with your head this way? Okay. Oh! Wow, okay. That's the most interesting way anyone's ever gotten on my Reiki table. Okay. - Okay. - Just put my head up there? - Yes. - All right. Okay. I... okay, uh, that looks actually really comfortable, but I should have been more specific. I meant on your... if you can get on your back with your head up here. Okay. - Perfect. - Like that? - Yes. Yeah. - Okay. - Is that good? - That's perfect. Just lie... if you let your feet... your legs lie flat on the table. Okay. Yeah, just completely let your legs fall where they... let your feet fall. - Like that? - Just absolutely relax. - Okay. - Let every muscle just relax. - Your hands. - Okay. Just resting comfortably at your side. - All right. - Yeah, just be comfortable. - All right. - Everything's fine. This is good. Okay, you know what? Maybe you should picture yourself someplace where you feel the most comfortable, the place where you feel safe, the place where you feel happy. You picture that. The office, like at my office. - Your office? - Mm-hmm. Maybe we should try to get out of the office and go to the beach and sit on the sand and feel the warm sun on your skin. I'd rather... I'd rather be at the office. Okay, all right. So, is there a favorite chair in your office or a favorite... - I like the back room where... - The back room. - To look at X-rays. - Where you look at X-rays, okay. Well, you look at X-rays in your back room and I will do Reiki. - Okay. - Okay. Just get in your back room, close your eyes. Are your eyes closed? - Yep. - okay. Yeah. Huh. Okay, wow. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - That was... that was great. - What's going on? - Are you okay? - Uh-huh. No, I just want to know what it's about. - Reiki? - Yeah. Like, how you're doing... what are you... how you're doing it. How... how are you doing it? What are you...? Well, do you want to learn how to do Reiki? Yes. Because I can... I mean, I can show you how. - I can teach you. - Great. Great. But it is energy work. You know that, don't you? Are you aware of that? It's energy work. Energy. And I channel energy into you to help you balance your energy and... you know what? Why don't we just... for today, why don't I work on you and you can feel what it feels like, and then we can meet another time and I can explain everything to do with Reiki? Okay. You could even be a Reiki master if you wanted to be. Is that what you want? You could be a Reiki master! - How's that sound? - It sounds good. Okay, so get back in your office. Okay. All right. - Okay? - Okay, Scoot down a little bit. That's perfect. - Is that good? - Yes. - Okay, you ready? Here we go. - Okay. - Okay. - Let's go. Pop your legs up on the couch. Just cross them over. Can you get that up there? Stay still, stay still. Just let go. Let go. Just relax down a little bit. Good. See? You're okay. I've got you. You're safe. You're... okay. You know what? Put your legs down on the floor. Just put them down on the floor. That's better. And onto the next position. Just over the heart, above the breast. And then move down to the lower abdo... yeah, right down in there. So, what we're gonna do, Dillon, in the first step is we're just going to be... put some articulate... Are you ready? All right. All right, here we go. One, two, three. - How's that feel? - Oh... Better? - Huh? - I think it... - Thank you so much. - Oh, you're welcome. - Thank you. - Oh. - You're welcome. - Thank you. You're welcome. It's a miracle. I... I felt something. I felt... did you feel something? Come on. See how that is. Good. Looks good. Thank you. I went to Bronwyn. - What do you mean? - I went. - You did? - Mm-hmm. Did you like it? Yes. - I'm impressed. - Thank you. And how are you? Been better. And, um... with the ecstasy, is that...? - Please don't start it. - No, I... - I have never taken it. - But you had it in your purse. I know, but it was just a crazy idea. I just thought I could make some things better. With Jesse? You and Jesse? I don't know, it's supposed to help you open up and help you connect and... But not to be. Don't worry. Your sister isn't a drug addict. Okay. You have to be careful. I know. How does Jenny seem to you? Fine. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I don't think she's fine. What do you mean? I think you need to let her go, Paul. I'm not... I'm not holding her hostage or anything. I just think she wants to be doing other things. I think she wants... I think she wants to go to school. In fact, I know she wants to go to school. She has never said anything to me about school that I know... Because she thinks you don't want her to go. - She thinks you want her... - We never even... - Ask her. - Never even discussed... Yeah, I know you never discussed. - Where do you come up with this? - I come up with it from her. She filled out all her college applications and she won't send them in because she thinks you're gonna be crushed. Yeah. Okay. You're a piece of work, you know that? Yeah? How am I... how am I a piece of work? Um, okay. You come into my house, okay, and... I come into your house? What do you mean? It's our house. It's our parents' house. - Okay, yeah... - It's the house that we grew up in. Our house, our house, but it's the house... - That we were both given. - the house that I've been maintaining. The house that I've been paying property taxes on since Mom died. Okay, fine, fine. It's your house, it's your house. - Your house. - That house that I've... Mm-hmm. And then... so you come in and then... and then you accuse me of holding my daughter hostage, okay? As opposed to, like, letting her live here rent-free, providing her with gainful employment, teaching her... teaching her a skill. Yeah, in a field she has zero interest in. Just ask her. Ask her if she's happy. I don't know. I'd better put this away. Is he in here? Scaler. Hello? Is he here? Hold on, sir. - I'd like my money back, please. This guy is a goddamn fraud. I paid him money. Fucking TMJ specialist. Hello? Is he here? All right, he's with a patient. Be right back. I'll just be right back. Hello? Yeah, hey, buddy! Yeah. - Good, go ahead and do that there. - He... he's... - Doctor! - He's in the middle of a procedure. This guy is a goddamn fraud. Hello, Doctor! Oh, there you are. You did not cure my TMJ. No, but I never... I never promised. You didn't promise? I paid you money. I'd like my money back, please. Not only is my TMJ raging, but I left here with the worst headache of my life.
