You serve your country, dear Baron, with true patriotic zeal. But money is missing. Too much. I know it was used for the common good, but the loss of 30,000 rubles is quite regrettable. Someone less tolerant might ask for explanations, or be shocked that you have no memory of the loan. You've something in mind, but it's still quite worrying. A secret matter, you may insist. But my dear Baron, our secret funds are not inexhaustible, alas. Despite our long friendship, I fear I can no longer turn a blind eye. My dear Baron, I trust you will not take this amiss. Thank you. Is that you, Pepel? Yes, it's me. I thought Kostylyov would never go to sleep. Does the money he cheats us out of keep him awake? You'll be glad to have him tomorrow. - Why tomorrow? - As if you didn't know. Your big job is tonight, isn't it? At the mansion. That's none of your business. Are you hiding something from me? You're wrong. I give you good advice. What would you do without us to buy what you steal? You and your husband profit as well. I take the risks, and you get the money. Right? You know it'll all be ours one day. Kostylyov's old. He won't live forever. We'll go somewhere nice, just the two of us. We'll start a new life. And no one will know our past. There's no point in daydreaming about us. - You don't love me anymore. - Me? Im warning you, don't you dare leave me! Id rather see you rot in prison than go off with someone else. If I go to jail, you and your husband won't be far behind me. No one will believe you. We have friends on the police force. Good night, Pepel. - Good night. Be careful tonight. Don't worry. We northerners aren't easy to catch. Don't treat it like a walk in the park. Alyoshka's coming. - So what? He'll wake up the old man. I told that rascal to never come back. Come on. Hey, lodgers! Hey, lodgers! Hey, lodgers! Is that you, Natasha? Sorry. Im a polite guy. I meant to wake old Kostylyov. He gets the money, but I got you! You've been out boozing again. - You know me. - Aren't you ashamed? You know, I am who I am. If people don't like it, too bad. My boss gave me the sack, but I don't give a damn. What's a boss, anyway? A simple misunderstanding! Go to bed. Wait. Not yet. I wrote a jolly little funeral march. Wanna hear it? - Be quiet! - I want to tell the world! No one's listening right now. Tell them tomorrow. I won't be drunk then. Ill have nothing to say. No one will mind. Go downstairs. Go on. Natasha, your eyes are like stars. Off to bed you go. Is that you? Were you looking for me? Yes, it's me. And here you are, the two of you. Nice and cozy. Vassilissa! Bitch! Damned bitch! Forgive me, Lord. Vassilissa, you drive me to sin. You make me angry. You make me swear. Ive looked everywhere for you. You should be in bed, but you're out here on the stairs. Tramp! Filthy animal! Clear out. Clear out, I said. Im the boss around here. You clear out, thief, or Ill have you arrested. Clear out, or Ill strangle you! Help me! Help! One more dent. If the boss grumbles, Ill get you another. You dropped it on purpose. - No, Im just clumsy. - You're clumsy, eh? Lucky for me. Otherwise, the way I was choking him - Don't touch me! You're revolting. Sleep with my sister, I don't care. Steal if you want. But don't touch me. You're too young to understand. One thing I do know: Men like you are despicable. Id like to explain, but Ive got a job waiting. I hope you get caught. You know, God doesn't favor the prayers of his saints. Good night, Natasha. Still up and about, Nastia? I get my rest on my feet. Aren't you fed up, out here all alone? - Aren't you fed up with what you do? - No. It's when Im here that it gets me. Everything seems fine, and then suddenly, it's like a chill comes over me and Ive had enough. It's about time. Stand up straight. - You stood me up last night. - You're still thinking about that? You asked me to dinner. I didn't have enough left to buy you a sandwich. - How about tonight? - Tonight is different. Ill win, and we'll go wherever you like. Lend me 1,000 rubles. At the moment I need them myself. But if you win? Later, dear child. Banco. - Good evening, Baron. - Good evening. I regret to say this, but perhaps you shouldn't play tonight. Why is that? Please understand, your debt is - That's precisely why Im here. We'll settle that tonight. He who pays his debts grows rich. You're dining with him? What about me? Silly, when that guy has money, he throws it around. He's crazy. - And if he loses? - I won't go. - How will you know? It's easy to tell. Whether he wins or loses, he always leaves calmly. He takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. If he's won, he lights it. If not, he's so nervous he can't light it. Baron, may I give you a bit of advice? Please do. Don't gamble anymore. lmpossible, my dear sir. Banco tonight, my dear Baron? Certainly, my dear Count. - Shall we play? - Id love to. Allow me to repay - It was 10,000 rubles, correct? - There's no hurry. - Debt of honor. The bank has 16,000. - Shall we, Count? - With pleasure. Banco. Four. Eight. Excuse me. The clock strikes midnight in the city The rich sleep in their featherbeds The rats scurry through the empty streets The crooks set out on a job They go calmly about their work Armed with revolvers and knives All trades are equal on this earth Each has his hour and his task When stealing is how you live When you steal or murder It;s not the lark you might imagine Pity the poor boys At the serenading hour When hearts rest easy That;s when they go to the guillotine Cry for the poor boys Excuse me. Care to dance? Did you lose? I was lucky, but my opponent was even more so. Quite a game. - They say you're in trouble. - People will talk. Is there nothing I can do? It's odd. Suddenly I feel that we cared very much for each other. - Won't I see you again? - Good night, dear. Pity. Care to dance, miss? Forgive me for keeping you waiting, Baron, but I dozed off. You have the right. These late hours aren't good for your health, Baron. And his lordship didn't even return home for dinner. The chicken was delicious. - You ate it? - Yes, sir. Then why are you complaining? A delegation of tradesmen came by. They waited for two hours. - No matter. - Creditors' agents, too. - Again? - Tomorrow they'll take everything. - They're welcome to it. - lt's no joking matter. Felix, you can't imagine what a pest you're being. His lordship is too kind. Wouldn't you like an employer who paid you regularly? Such employers are a dime a dozen, sir. Then you'll remember me fondly when Im gone? Surely the baron is joking. Anything else, sir? - Go to bed, Felix. - Good night, sir. - Good night, Felix. Sleep well, sir. I won't be easily awakened. Please be so kind as to return my gun. - What? - I need it. - Sorry? - Careful, it's loaded. Put it down. - You won't call for help? - Call who? - Servants. The police. - What for? - You give your word? If I understand correctly, you're here to rob me. How funny. You've got the wrong house. The banker lives next door. - Don't try to fool me. - Im not. You'll be lucky to find 50 rubles in the whole place. You're welcome to the rest. It's no longer mine. How about a shot for courage? Yes? Yes. A drink between colleagues. No joke? You can trust me. Then let's have another. It's good stuff. Is your line of work profitable? Well, it has its ups and downs. Somehow the job that'll put you on easy street never pans out. That's life, my friend. Are you hungry? - I wouldn't want to impose. But you'd rob me blind instead? Hardly logical. To hell with logic. I was raised with certain manners. We'll say you're stealing it, then. Better? In that case, I don't mind at all. - Are you often hungry? - lt happens. - Where do you sleep? - ln a flophouse. - Happy with your life? - Sometimes. When? When? I like it in the summer when it's nice and warm. I like dozing in the grass. Is that nice? It can be. - Have you always lived like that? - Always. Did you never think such a life wasn't worth the trouble? Such a life? It's the only life I know, sir. You may drop the formalities. With pleasure. You lose. - What were we playing for? - Your place in paradise. - May I take one? - Help yourself. - There's only one left. - Take it. Then we'll split it. Here. Take my case, then. If you insist. Pepel, it's a pity I didn't meet you before. Why didn't you rob me sooner? If only Id known. - Are we stopping? - Im tired. This is cozy. It's a shame to take it off. - Then keep it. - I couldn't. They'd give me a hard time at the flophouse. - What are you doing? - Relax. Only servants are bothered by things like that. - Will we meet again? - Who knows? Id like to give you a souvenir. Choose something. - I couldn't. - None of it is mine anyway. Id like that. Handsome beasts. - And they're detachable. You like it? - Very much. Ive always liked horses. It's the only thing Ive ever won: a prize for horsemanship. - Can I really have it? - And anything else you like. I don't care about the rest, but this I like. This is the real deal! - lt's bronze. They didn't cheat you, buddy. - One stylish valet. What style is it? - Stylish. - Three armchairs. - Take them away. One large and two small carpets. Over there. Four curtains. One, two, three, four. - A chandelier with five arms. - Up there. - One gilded wooden console, marble top. - Over there. Come, gentlemen. Ill announce you to the baron. One allegorical statue. Allegorical. There. ...a tapestry by Gob - I can't read it. Gobelins! Did the baron sleep well? No, but what a pleasure to wake up. The repossessors are here, sir. I trust my egg will not be spoiled. A messenger from the count is waiting, sir. - Show him in. - Now? - While there's still something to sit on. - Quite right, sir. Shall I raise the blinds? - lf you wish. Tell me, Felix. Have you ever slept in the grass? It would be beneath my dignity, sir. If anyone says I have, be assured it is slander. - I didn't believe it, Felix. - Thank you, sir. In the grass! - Shall I show him in? - Show him in, Felix. - Please forgive so early a visit, Baron. - Please sit down. - The nature of my visit forbids it. - Then remain standing. In view of last night's incident, the count hereby informs you your presence at the chancellery is no longer required. - What incident? - The 50,000 rubles you lost. Oh, yes, the secret funds. The noise is my furniture being sold. The count intervened on your behalf to accord you an unlimited leave. Without pay. Thank him for me. Did he mention the 10,000 rubles I repaid him? - Not to me. - Quite right. Reassure the Count. Ill go away for a cure. Ill send him the address of some quiet spot in case he too needs some rest. Care for an egg? Baron! Good-bye, sir. Show the gentleman out. Sir, a policeman is here. A burglar was arrested and he claims to know you. His name's Pepel. PepeIs been arrested? Quick, help me dress. - lt's you. - Yes, it is. I wanted you to get caught. You said God wouldn't listen. - God is misinformed. Im innocent. - Tell him yourself - I don't believe you. Don't believe me? I swear he gave me those things. Who? A baron. He even invited me for dinner. - Really? - We had veal. Yeah, roast veal. When I left, he gave me a bronze statue. The only thing he'd ever won: a prize for horsemanship. A bronze statue? The horses you saw on the table. I saw them, all right - Im sure you stole them. Believe what you want. I don't care. Did Vassilissa send you? You came on your own? You felt sorry for Pepel the thief? Sorry? You got what you deserved. You were looking to go to prison. I hope you never get out. No use getting all worked up. Good-bye. - Pepel! - What? I brought you an orange and an apple, and some cigarettes. Id rather have had a kind word. I can't. Thanks anyway. What is this chair? The bailiff said that people must be left something to sit on. Could they be more sensitive? Apparently it's the law. Good old Felix, Ill never return here. I can hardly restrain my tears, sir. You are impeccable, Felix. Tell me, Felix, I owe you a lot in wages, but will all you've stolen from me be fair compensation? Have no worries on that account, sir. Don't bother to show me out - I know the way. Farewell, Felix. In a way, lnspector, I don't mind landing in jail. Im actually glad. - Really? - Yes. There are certain people Im avoiding. You know, bad influences. You must be thinking, A bad influence on Pepel? Must be real scum! You're absolutely right. Worse. lt's no laughing matter, I swear. - Really? - Oh, yes. So on the one hand, Id like to stay in prison, but on the other, Id like to be released to prove to a certain person that Im not what she thinks I am. She's so stubborn. Worse than a mule! - How interesting. - lsn't it? So, how about a good deed? Drop the charges. Just to really get her goat. What is it? Come closer. We're in for a laugh. The baron is here in person. Baron, you honor us too much, coming here on such a trivial matter. We'll return your items after we've dealt with this man. - What items? - The cigarette case and the bronze. Was something else stolen as well? - Nothing was stolen. Kindly release my dear friend. Hello, Pepel. - How are you, Baron? Id be happy to oblige, Baron, but this man told us such an unbelievable story - But no matter, Baron. You are free to go, dear sir. Thank you, Baron. - Coming, Pepel? - Yes. Cigarette? - You're welcome. - Good-bye, lnspector. Your humble servant, Baron. Your tie and shoelaces. Is everything in order? That was kind of you, Baron. Not so kind, really. Maybe you'll return the favor. How could I ever? We may meet again, sooner than you think. - Where? - Let's let that be a surprise. Farewell, Pepel. Good-bye, Baron. The bronze, and you have the cigarette case already? Sign here, please. - Where? There. Give that back, you dirty thief! You're the thief, charging so much for this rubbish. Look. Here you go, little man. And if someday someone tells you PepeIs a thief, you'll set them straight. Who starts? - Here's my spade. - You didn't have a spade before! I can't play with a cheater! Get out of here! He's not here. - Who? - Who do you think? Mind your own business. I came to check on things. The floor hasn't been swept. It's the actor's turn. I don't care. lf the police come to inspect, Ill be fined. And if that happens, Ill throw you all out. - What will you live on? - Lodgers are easy to come by. Why don't you sweep instead of reading all the time? Have you seen my sister? No, I haven't. - Doomed Love. - Give it back! Stop squabbling and sweep the floor. Look how filthy it is. A real pigsty. Give me my book! You're nuts with your book. You believe all that nonsense? This isn't nonsense! You're all too stupid to understand! Let her read. If she believes it, it's true. Stupid novel. A pack of lies. Have pity. See? She's crying. She enjoys it. Leave her alone. Go ahead. lt's your turn. No. I can't breathe in all that dust. It's harmful to my health. Your organism is poisoned by alcohol. So the doctor told me yesterday. Your organism is poisoned by alcohol. Your organo! Not organo. Organism. Your organism is - Sicambrian! Sicambrian. Im very serious. My organism is poisoned. I can't breathe dust. - Microbiatic! - What? - lt's a very learned word. I know tons of others like it. I read a lot when I was a telegraphist. And in Hamlet - In Hamlet the poet says - Words, words and more words. There's a great play. I played the gravedigger. You'd better start playing the sweeper. You make so much noise. You bang and bang. It's killing my ears. - Has my wife been in? - I don't know. You're a nuisance. You've got your spot, your bed, your workbench, yourself - and all that for two rubles a month. Ill have to charge you half a ruble extra. Charge me extra for a rope and strangle me. Why should l? What good would that do me? On the contrary, may God keep you. Live as you like, and with that half ruble you give me Ill light a candle to the Holy Virgin. It will atone for my sins... and yours as well. Don't you worry about your sins? You're a wicked man. No one likes you or respects you. You're a nuisance. Let me work. You're not like the actor. At least he's a good man. He doesn't make noise. He's an educated man. Kostylyov, I don't have any money. Will you give me credit? As a reward for my goodness. Goodness is not rewarded with gold, my friend. Goodness is the most precious of treasures. That has nothing to do with what you owe me. You owe me your goodness free of charge, poor fool. Wretched old crook! What a lout. If you don't pay me tomorrow, you're out on the street! There are lots of others to take your place. Give me the broom. You can get back to your dreams, and I don't mind sweeping. My organism... is poisoned by alcohol. I understand you, my children. You are poor lost lambs. Black sheep! Good-for-nothings! Day after day Night after night Always the same hopelessness Always waiting Hurry up, Natasha, you lazy girl! There's work upstairs. Why aren't you in school? Resting, Pepel? - Yes, I am. Lucky you, with nothing to do. What business is it of yours? Beat it. Watch how you speak to me! You forget Im the boss around here. You owe me respect. Why take that tone with your fellow man? - Have you got my money? - What money? - For the watch. - What watch, my son? Don't play games with me. Yesterday, you promised me You gave me three. You owe me seven. Hand it over! Stop blinking like an old owl. Don't get mad! That watch was - Stolen. You knew that yesterday. I don't buy stolen goods. No kidding, holy man. Hurry up and give me my money. All in good time, Pepel. What crude people! Well, well. So it's all gone? Your house, clothes, cognac? Gone, even the memory. - So you'll stay here? - Yes. - lt isn't so bad. - You'd leave if it was. That's another story. Come on, Ill find you a bed. Good old baron. Here's a new lodger. Who is he? Just passing through. - For the night or longer? - We'll see. You have any papers? Lots, but they're all worthless. You have any money? Ill vouch for him. He's a friend. Come on. - King. - You always get that one. It's an old habit. I can't help it. - Queen. - Ive got another, nice and fresh. This one is free. The owner's in jail. Must have wanted a fresh bed. Don't worry, Ill get you a mattress. Nothing to fret over. Don't you want to know why Im here? No one asks questions around here. You're one of us now. It doesn't matter anyway. What do you call yourself now? Afraid Baron would sound ridiculous here? Not at all. - Are you a real baron? - As real as can be. We had a count here once. A good guy, but he put on airs. Nobility is like the pox - you never get rid of it entirely. If you're a baron, stay one. We're all free men here. See, he knows everything. - What are they playing? - Manille. Know how to play? - I know them all. - Go ahead. - Your turn. - Diamonds. - Play. - There. Baron, Ill leave you with these gentlemen. Have fun. See you later. Is there room for one more? - Got money to lose? - Fifty kopecks. - Sit right down. - Give him your seat. Whose deal is it? Yours. Mine? Perfect. If I only had five kopecks. - What for? - To drink. Don't drink. lt's bad for you. Take this and let us play in peace. - Thanks. - Go on, deal. Grandfather. What is it, my child? Tell me something. Talk to me. l;m afraid. Ive always been afraid. Ive been beaten so much. Ive always been hungry, yet Ive always been afraid of taking more than my share. Does one suffer there as here? You'll want for nothing. You won't be afraid. Death brings peace. Death is kind to us poor. You are so good. You won't suffer anymore. It will all disappear. I tell you, Anna, death is like a mother to us. - Where'd you hear that? - I didn't hear it. It's my own idea. Faith in something makes it real! Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. What difference does it make anyway? Thank you, lnspector. God will reward your kindness to a poor old man. Next Sunday Ill light a candle for your soul. Your sister-in-law is a hard worker. Pretty, as well. I know whereof I speak. - You think? - We worry about her. That's normal, at her age. At her age, I was a real live wire, completely wild. A real prankster! Even now I enjoy a good laugh. But all in good taste, of course. When one has my position, dignity must be upheld. Miss, a pleasure. Madame, Ill visit again very soon. I really like this house. - Good-bye, lnspector. - My respects, lnspector. Don't bother to show me out. I know the way. As you wish, lnspector. Why are you just standing around? Go finish your curtain. Listen, did you see how the inspector looked at Natasha? What do you think? - I don't understand. You never do. You need that man. The just man is always vulnerable. It's a cruel world. And with PepeIs carelessness - What? Not to mention all the others. And all the merchandise Ive got in stock. - Stolen merchandise. - Not all of it. You knew the risks in being a fence. A fence did you say? Bitch! Tramp! I picked you out of the gutter. Come in. What is it? Anna just died. Well, now. What a life! I must go to the police station and make a statement. The police will come. Go downstairs. Anna died. Lay her out as best as you can. Hurry up, lazybones! lmagine her coming here to die. Wasn't there anywhere else? Pepel, aren't you - God have mercy on her soul. - Running off? - Im going for a walk. Ive had enough of all this. - Had enough of me, too? - You, too. Im not the clinging type. You can't force love, can you? Thanks for the truth. What truth? It's over between us. You look at me like you didn't know me. But I do. You're a pretty woman, Vassilissa. You've got what it takes... but my heart never beat for you. It wasn't always like that. Even then, it wasn't love. Any regrets? Yes, in a way. You're heartless. Do you regret everything? Not everything. But pleasure isn't enough in itself. What I really wanted was someone to tame me, gently, tenderly, like you would a wild animal. Someone who'd try to make me into another man. There's someone else. It's obvious. I won't be humiliated. When I get ahold of your sweetheart, she'll pay for it. This is a slap in the face, Pepel, and I won't take it sitting down. Don't be mad. Let's make it a clean break. You ever think maybe I wanted something else, too? Think you're the only one who wants to escape this mess? I can't stand it. Im suffocating here. I was counting on you to get me out of here. You were my only hope. Get rid of my husband for me. He's old and evil. It would be a good deed. That's a nice combination: a husband in the ground and a lover in the joint. Why in the joint? Kostylyov could have an accident. He's always exploited you. Remember last year? You went to jail because of him! You disgust me. You refuse to help me? Watch out, Pepel. It's dangerous to cross me! You're all bark and no bite. Not one word of pity. From anyone! - Don't be shocked. How can we pity the dead when we have no pity for the living? We don't even pity ourselves. Come on. This is no place for you. - I don't like the dead. - Why should you? Love the living. What incredible luck! Magnificent round. But the one time I finally win, it's for a pittance a point. - Buying the drinks? - Of course. - Keep it down. - lt doesn;t matter. Neither words nor noise can bother the dead. Anyway, she's better off dead. Lord, why did she even live? We're born, we live, we die. It's nothing to cry over. Ill die in a flophouse too, someday. Nonsense. Your life is just beginning. It might be different. Why kid myself? No, try to understand. No man ever loved Anna. Perhaps a bit of love would've changed everything. What man is there here to love me? Drunks and thieves? Drunks aren't always drunk, nor thieves always in prison. Everyone gets a break sometime. Listen, Natasha. You ought to come away with me. Why? You have to love a man to do that. There are days when I hate you with all my heart! I think real love should be blind to faults, and I see yours clear as day. What's the difference if you beat me or my sister does? Id sooner break my own arm than harm you. No, Pepel. The man Ill love won't be from here. He'll have a job and he'll work. He'll walk down the street without worrying about the police. It's Pepel. And I never suspected. I see. You want the same breed, just younger. Get out, you little hypocrite! - Calm down! - This is my man! His clothes are mine! Ill have you beaten and thrown out! Little slut! - Will you calm down? Go ahead, hit me. lnsult me. Go upstairs. You're acting like a fool! And over nothing. You'll never have her, Pepel. Not her. I just want peace. Keep it up and you'll get your peace the same way Anna did. Every night he came to the garden. I trembled with fear and sadness. He was pale, too, clutching his revolver. Such hotheads, these students! My tender love, he murmured. My tender love! - Don't stop her from lying. - Go on, Nastia. He called me his boundless love. My parents oppose this marriage and threaten to disown me, so Ive decided to end it all. He raised his pistol, loaded with 10 bullets. Farewell, he said. l can't live without you. I answered, My unforgettable Villiam - William. It was Gaston the other day. Stop teasing the poor girl. Show some respect. It's not what she says that matters, but why she says it. - Go on. - We're listening. They're just jealous because they have nothing to tell. No, Ill say no more. I said to him, Light of my life, nor can I live without you on this earth. Ill love you as long as I live, but don't sacrifice your young life for me. Go, leave me. Ill spend all my days weeping for you. - Don't cry. - What an idiot! And it's all from Doomed Love. Shut up! You're so low, nothing moves you. I believe you, dear. You had a great love. You're telling the truth. He was a student, you know. His name was Gaston. He had a black goatee and patent-leather shoes. God strike me dead if Im lying! He loved me like I loved him! Patent-leather shoes, of course. A real student. A search? Lord, spare me such a trial! But what am I accused of? Am I not a good citizen? I pay my taxes, though God knows they're high. I respect the authorities. Kostylyov, this is not my doing. I just came to give you a friendly warning. Someone high up has their eye on you. I can't risk my position. Can't we work something out? If it's a question of money, in spite of my poverty, I could make a sacrifice. It's a touchy situation. You're in a bind, and I don't want to be dragged into it. It's so hot today! May I offer you some tea? Please don't bother. I insist. Ill call Natasha. She makes wonderful tea. Excellent idea. But is your sister really here? I thought she was out. Oh, no. She just - We'll have someone call her. A little woman like her is just what I need. A sweet and lively housewife. It's simple, lnspector. She does everything here. A hard worker, inexpensive, easy to feed. She's full of virtues. All that and a pretty face, too. That never hurts. The truth is, she's healthy and well-built. With all the work in this house, I don't know what we'd do without her. But for you, no sacrifice is too great. Yes, but would she have me? Don't worry. Ill see to it. I meant, she'd be most flattered by your attention. Lord, first you send down these troubles upon me, and now you take Natasha away. About those troubles... perhaps we can work something out. Listen, leave the washing. Go make some tea. It isn't time yet. We have a guest. Who? - The inspector. - Im not going. Why not? I don't like him. He's fat and sweaty. Men who sweat like that are disgusting. I don't want to see him. How dare you speak to me that way? Don't you realize we need that man? If he wanted, he could arrest us tomorrow, or take away Kostylyov's housing license. In any case, he could ruin us. You're nothing but an ungrateful wretch. What does he want, anyway? To see you for a moment. That's not much. And it'll get us out of this mess. Have you no heart? Don't forget that we've fed you, sheltered you, saved you from the gutter. Enough. Ill go. They look after people like me? Where? In - Ive forgotten the name of the town, but Ill remember. There's a magnificent hospital with marble floors and columns. It's bright and airy. You breathe freely. A palace. - Marble. Doctors in white coats look after you with great kindness. Until then, get ready to be healed. Stop drinking, okay? You'll start a new life. A little tea in a family setting now and then is just the thing. It makes me forget my administrative headaches. Oh, yes. Miss? May I ask a favor? We could go out on Sunday. We could go to dinner anywhere you please. Would you like that? - Certainly she would. My sister never gets out. - The poor child. What an honor for her. Isn't it, Natasha? Don't cry. I don't want to hurt you. Just the opposite. The idiot! She'll ruin everything. My dream is to protect you. Why refuse before you hear me out? You'd live like a queen. Believe me. Accept before it's too late. Old Kostylyov can't be easy to live with. And the others in the courtyard. Look at them. Wallowing like pigs. Is that any life for you? I say it isn't. And that's all I have to say. I dreamed I was fishing and caught a huge bream. It must've weighed five pounds. A real dream fish. And then - And then your line broke, and you woke up. And the bream was Vassilissa. No, she makes me sick. Everything here makes me sick. Everything you touch is filthy. The mattress, the pots - everything's rotten. The feelings, even the words you say - covered in lice, cockroaches and slime. Fishing for bream didn't work out so well. Next time, dream about a different fish. And Nastia with her Gaston, and the actor with his organism. Im tired of listening to them. I need a change. Im sick and tired of them. Are you tired of me? Of course not, you're different. You don't lie. You don't go on about why you're here. That'd be hard to do. I don't know how I got here. There's a kind of fog in my noggin. When I look back, it seems all I did was change uniforms. First the schoolboy, then the student. Ive forgotten everything I ever learned at the university. I got married, wore a tailcoat, then a dressing gown. What was the point? I wore the uniform of a government official and grew poorer. My clothes became more and more threadbare. Finally I wear these, the last of the line. And it all seems like a dream. Isn't it absurd? Ever been to prison? That would have been one more uniform. - And you? - No, not yet. But it'll happen sooner or later. My path was laid out for me by my father. Poor guy spent his life in prison and urged me to follow in his footsteps, so - His concern for you does him credit. Is he dead? - Yes. He died in prison, just as I will. The only thing that could change my father's prediction is if Natasha ran away with me. - Really? - Yeah. If she'd just throw her arms around me and say, Pepel, I believe in you. You'll protect me. No more Pepel the thief. Id be a new man. We'd go far away, far from all this filth and rottenness! What about you, Baron? - Ill stay here. Once you told me how nice it was to doze in the grass. I didn't really believe you then, but I do now. Pepper? I don't care. Mustard? - I don't care. - She doesn't care. Ill serve you myself. Salad? I want to save you from that brute Kostylyov. Don't be a hypocrite. You know my sister made me come. So what? Isn't it nice here? We can come every Sunday. Every day of the week. Believe me when I say I want to treat you like a little queen. You're no king. No king! She's so witty! Tell your king you're not angry. Have mercy. Make me drink until I forget everything. Get me stewed to the gills, otherwise Ill never agree to be your queen. For that you must agree to drink something! Come, my little treasure. Leave it to me. In one hour, you won't even remember your mother's name. - What are you doing here? - Am I bothering you? - I came here to get away from you. - Looking for my sister, no doubt. Why are you avoiding me? I told you. lt's over between us. You're driving me crazy, always after me. Im sick of your stories, sick of your face! Get it? - What's wrong with me? - You're selfish. You'd do anything to get what you want. And her, with her great big eyes and clumsy hands, what can she give you? That's my business. What if she's making a fool of you? What if the sweet rose, the holy saint, was like everyone else: selling to the highest bidder? I don't believe it. Poor fool. Know where she is? It's the story of the pate made of lark: half lark and half horse. One lark. You're not following. One lark, and one horse. - One horse. - One lark. Where'd my cigar go? Tell me the one about the fat shopkeeper. - Where's my cigar? - lt's too much! Where is he? I asked where he was. What do you want? How dare you come in here! Oh, it's you. This won't take long. Get out or Ill call the police. Natasha, we need to talk, but this place disgusts me. What right do you have to order me around? Im not Vassilissa. Let me go! - Exactly! What right? Don't touch her, you thief! Vagabond! Hoodlum! Pimp! Go back to Vassilissa! Shut up. Vassilissa's money isn't enough. You want her sister too! Let go. You're hurting me. You're hurting me, too, you know. Come on. Help! Murderer! Hoodlum! Pimp! He's killing me! Police! Murderer! What is this? Get the police. I didn't do anything. To hell with your champagne! A bit of ice, lnspector. It'll do you good. Settle down. Let me do it. lt's nice and cold. - The fresh air is helping already. Little fool. Sure you're not nuts? I think you twisted my arm. That's not all. Id twist your neck to stop you. I don't have a choice. What else can I do with my life? Unless I follow Anna into the hereafter. No, you're not going to follow Anna. - Then who? - Me. Where? To prison? Natasha, try to understand me. It's true - Im a thief. No one ever taught me anything else. My father was the same, and even before I could walk, people called me a thief. Maybe if they hadn't, things would've been different. Tell me, Natasha. Won't you try to understand me? Believe me. Suppose I did? If you believed me, I swear Id give it all up, stealing and all this filth. We'd go away together, anywhere. Far away. Id work. I can read and write. Im a good locksmith. Im strong, and with you in my arms, Id be even stronger. Id move mountains! Just say you trust me. - Silly Pepel. - Why? - Are you blind? - What do you mean? - Don't you understand? - Tell me. Let me go! I love you, Pepel. Ill follow you anywhere. Wicked girl! Don't you realize you're sinning against God? Don't bother taking that off. Go to your fiance, right now, and beg forgiveness. I won't! You have no idea how angry I am! Go apologize! - I won't! - Obey him! I won't! Let go! You won't go? You scum! That's Natasha screaming! Filth! Get upstairs quick. Natasha needs you. Did they hurt you? Get off me! Careful, Pepel! This is a family matter! Have you no shame? If you touch her, you'll answer to me! Let me at that bastard! Let me go! Let me at him! A pretty pickle. This looks bad. Here come the police. Kostylyov's been murdered. Pepel killed him. Yes, Pepel did it. I saw it with my own eyes. It was Pepel. He's upstairs. What are you waiting for? It wasn't a murder. It was a brawl. We're all just as guilty as Pepel. He was an old bastard. His lack of kindness was what killed him. I got a few licks in, too! He was about done for. - I kicked him - - We don't know who hit him. I hit him, too! The lower depths killed him, not just Pepel. - Quiet, old fool. - lt's the truth. - Where is he? - Upstairs with my sister. It;s carnival today All the world is celebrating Wearing unique costumes Everyone is masquerading Im leaving. You hear me? Im leaving. All my life Ive wanted to escape from here. Im finally leaving. Hey, silly goose. What are you sniveling about? What will you do? Ill wait for him. He'll leave, you'll see. Who's he? Who's he? Him. Me. You're so modest, he of the confused genius. Where will you go? To look for a town, a hospital. A big, bright, clean hospital, all marble and no dust. Ill get better there. Ill be myself again. Ill be on the path to rebirth, as King Lear said. Ill regain my name, my stage name. No one knows it here. You don't know what it's like to lose your name. My name. Even a dog has a name, but not me! That Louka was a dangerous charlatan. He's turned your head with his lies, poor actor. You're the liar, charlatan. Shut up, milady. Louka was senile. Baron, tell the truth: Was Louka lying? He lied all day long. Was he lying about the place where drunkards can be cured? He meant if you keep drinking, you'll end up in the madhouse. - The madhouse? - The madhouse. Don't listen. lf Louka said so, it must be possible. The madhouse? You're a real baron. Even in rags you're a menace. Little louse. Can't you play something more cheerful? Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold. There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st but in his motion like an angel sings, still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims. Such harmony is in immortal souls. But whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it. Harmony. Come. lt won't take long. To die, to sleep, no more. And by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. To die, to sleep, no more. And by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. Listen to the actor. He's got talent. Well, Baron, I have nothing to give you as a souvenir. So let's divide up the stables. Take one. - You have any money? - Ive got 40 rubles. That's enough. Good-bye. Good-bye, Nastia. You're a true friend. Forty rubles. Forty rubles. For two people. That's what I said: 40 rubles. Sentinel, keep close watch I could never lie to you I would prefer my freedom Come quick! It's serious. The actor's hung himself. Tonight the singing's come to an end. Come on. Let's get moving.
