I told you to go before leaving. - What is it, kiddo? - We're almost there. I'm out of cigarettes, be right back. Hurry, Mom! Quick! Cristina! The bastards! Fuckers! Horacio! They hit me on the leg! Horacio, what happened? - Are you alright? - I'm fine. You okay, kiddo? Go with him. Take him! It's okay, honey. Daddy's alright. Horacio, what'll we do? Let's get outta here! After the death of President Pern. Paramilitary groups started persecuting and murdering social activists and revolutionaries. The military seized power. Unleashing the most violent repression in Argentina's history. Exiled in Cuba. The revolutionary leaders of Montoneros initiate the "Counterstrike Operation." Some activists go home with their children. Hello, hello, 1, 2, 3, 4, testing. Ready. Shall we? Okay. Hey, handsome. It's funny I'm taping this rather than saying it to you. But hey, it's so that you can listen to us as many times as you want till we meet again. Today we begin our journey back to Argentina, but we'll take different roads, which means we'll be separated for a while. Here's Dad. Go on. Hey, kiddo. Here I am. We'll be separated for a while, so I'll miss you like crazy. But the good thing is, we're going back. And that we're doing this because... because we think it's the right time to carry on fighting. We're going back separately. You and Vicky go with Carmen and Gregorio. They'll be your parents. You'll be going through Brazil. If anybody asks a question, you say: "I don't speak Spanish." Eu no falo espaol. Good. Move it! Kiddo. Remember how I told you all about when El Che left Cuba? You did those drawings. Amazing. I still have them. Now it's your turn to do as he did. Remember that time he went to Congo. Dressed as a business man. Suit, tie and all? With a Uruguayan passport under the name "Ramn Benitez Fernndez." That's how nobody recognized him. And in Bolivia he went by the name "Adolfo Mena Gonzlez" and also wore a suit. And you laughed that he shaved his head as if he had gone bald. And those glasses... But your favorite detail was the hat he wore... So, handsome. This is your mission. You've already chosen a name. You're no longer Juan. From now on you're... Ernesto. So, what about the World Cup? We don't discuss soccer, but congratulations on winning the Cup. World champions - gotta give it to us, huh? Welcome to our country. I'll go make a call across the street. Meet you at the bar. Stay here. We'll be right back. What's up, kiddo? Uncle! - Why're you here? - Cool it. We don't want to attract a crowd! - What're you doing 'ere? - "Doing 'ere?" That Cuban accent will get us killed! Pretend we saw each other yesterday. Now we get up, calmly walk over there and continue the trip. Carmen and Gregorio? Carmen and Gregorio are gone. You're with me now. - How awesome is this van? - Oi, awesome van. What do you mean "oi", awesome van? We say "hey" here. Stay calm. Don't talk. I'll do the talking. - Documents. - Hello, officer. Juan, you have to repeat it over and over. You can't hesitate. Remember. You're no longer Juan. You're Ernesto. Kiddo! CLANDESTINE CHILDHOOD Mom? Dad? Morning, kiddo! Put some shoes on, you'll freeze. Morning, handsome! Had a good night's rest? Boy, did I miss you! - Okay... - Don't you love me anymore? - Chilly, huh? - We miss the tropical warmth. - So what's this place? - The shed. Here we pack the peanuts, hang our things, everything. Not this, You know better. Good, aren't they? Somebody left the fridge open outside! - I already said that. - Who do we have here? Fidel Castro? That accent again! Wait. Actually we come from Crdoba. So you want him to do the Crdobes sing-song? Too hard. Try the Buenos Aires accent. - Our papers say we're from Crdoba. - The kids won't notice. It's easier for him. Give it a shot, see what you got. Practice, kiddo! It's hot. I'm Ernesto Estrada. Hang on... Give me your glasses. - Cut it out. - Give me your glasses. Please! Sir... Go on. All set... I'm Ernesto, I come from Crdoba, an Argentine province. Look. This is your hiding place. If anything happens, you come here. It opens like this. Come on in. - Really? - Yes. It opens here and closes here. Neat! Awesome! Good morning. Stand up! Good morning, Headmistress. Sit down. Children... I want you to meet your new classmate, Ernesto. He's from Crdoba and lives in our neighborhood. Ernesto, this is Zulma, your new teacher. Hello, Ernesto, nice to meet you. Welcome. - Cat got your tongue? - Hello. Now go and sit next to Maxi. Will you make room for him? Good day. Good day, Zulma. Good day, Headmistress. You may sit now. Get your things out, Ernesto. So, we've covered Columbus, his arrival in America. Now, what was the most important thing the Spaniards brought? Yes, Esteban. The Spaniards brought Spanish. That wasn't the most important thing. - Anybody? Yes... - Culture. - Well done! - The Catholic religion. Culture, our Catholic religion... Civilization. The Spaniards brought civilization. Hand me that. And why is ours missing the sun? Because we use the original one, created by Belgrano, just blue and white. - Hand me that. - Belgrano? Who's he? He's the creator of the Argentine flag, kiddo. And he made it based on the rosette. Remember that? The blue and white thing we wear on national holidays? Yeah, the little circle. Hand me the last one. But the flag with the sun was later chosen as the war flag and that's the one that stuck. Hey! What are you up to, kiddo? Don't touch, remember? Come in. - Can they remove the blindfolds? - No, the blinds first. Beto... You can take off the blindfolds. - Good to see you. - This way. Form a line, please. Attention! Eyes on compaero Daniel. At ease! Right, compaeros, from now until this meeting is over, the house and group are under my command. On this day, we assemble the Special Agitation Troops, Platoons 1 and 2. Compaera Charo will hand out your defense tools. Signal interference tools will follow presently. Charo... Compaero Pedro, here are your gun, magazine, chamber empty of ammo. Compaera Luca, here are your gun... Easy... Before we start the instruction... Beto. A moment for our compaeros fallen in the revolutionary fight. - Compaero Marcos. - Here! - Compaero Gregorio. - Here! - Till victory. - Always. - Pern or death! - Long live our homeland! You suffer because I'm pushed away By a hope of tomorrow That I look painstakingly Only for you A string of stars Warmly breaking Your beautiful eyes Mourning me thus Dreams of youth that die in your good-bye Timid remembrance that I will miss Songs of hope that I kindled Caressing your soul in my solitude My poor heart doesn't think straight And when it gets pushed away from you It can only weep It can only moan Bleeds to death in your good-bye It's one of those complex decisions, but that's why we're here, to raise awareness, reinforce our ideas. Justice, justice for all! - My turn... - Forget it. - Why? - You can't see. - Check Natalia out. - Get outta here! There's some serious eye candy. - Which one? - Not that one, she's ugly! - With the blue stripes? - No, the red one. That one in blue, stretching. Yeah, some pair of legs! You don't know the first thing about legs. Oh, shut up! At least I got juice. - Well done, Natalia! - Quit it! Feli, look, your sister's up next. Hope she falls, after what she did to me. - She's always up to something! - She's impossible. She's hot. Can't be that bad... She's horrible! You're crazy! - I'd totally screw her. - What? You prick! Crdoba, are you on the moon? Somebody else has a crush on your sister. Me? Not at all. "Me", Crdoba! You ruined this picture. First time in front of a camera? You could at least smile! Mom... I have a camping trip. When? October 12th. It's just one night. I suppose it's alright. What is it? Anything else? I wanted to ask you something. How did you know that dad was... Well, not that... that you liked him. I dunno. You get a feeling in your tummy like... just different. - Sounds strange. - It is strange. A mutual friend threw a party and that's how I met him. It was in a basement. When he showed up, he looked at me, gave me a big smile, and I just fell for him. So, it was love at first sight. You could say that. At least for me. Your dad played hard to get. It took two months to win him over. We became friends, he talked to me. I loved his eyes, his way of putting things, so earnestly. And those glasses he wore! - What's your story? - What? - What are you up to? - With what? - Don't beat about the bush. - There's nobody. Seriously. I just wanted to know... how it felt. You fancy a classmate. You fancy a classmate. I could kill the little brat. You're mine, all mine! Mine, mine! Who is it? Who is it? Nobody. Nobody. What happened? It was a set-up. Fuck! - Are you alone? - Yes, I am. - What happened? - It was a trap. Gallego, the son of a bitch! Are you alright? - Let me see. - What is it, Beto? - Let me see. - Stop it! Let me see. Tell me everything, dammit! I got there 10 minutes early to scout the place. It looked OK. At the arranged time, I turn the corner. The guy's sitting on the sidewalk. He gets up, pretends to drop his wallet... Son of a bitch! He stoops to pick it up... He glances sideways. I follow his gaze and these two guys see me staring. Fuckers! So I ran away, firing three shots, down into the tube station and hid in a bathroom. What's going on, Daniel? We've been snitched on. What do I know? Shit! Shit! - Sure you were alone? - Yes! Hide, Juan! You checked, Beto? Yes, I checked! Easy there, Vicky. Easy. Hush, please. Here, baby. Everything alright? It was nothing, nothing. Hi. - I saw you yesterday. - You did? - Real good, that thing you do. - Thank you. I'm Ernesto. Yes, I know. I'm Mara. Yes, I know. Arms' length! Ernesto, as you're new, you have the honor of raising the flag. I can't. - What do you mean? - It's just I don't want to. Don't be shy, come on. - I'm not going. - Ma'am, can I go? Coward! Didn't they teach patriotism in your province? Coward! Fight! Fight! I can't figure this out. To fight for not wanting to raise the flag? First time ever. You see, Ernesto is very shy. He doesn't like crowds. We can't tolerate fighting. But he's adjusting, isn't he? Well, boys, stand up, and shake hands. Go on then! Stand up and shake hands. Just silly squabbles, ma'am. Shake hands. A man must learn to forgive certain things. Shake hands, then. Go on. Shake hands with your friend. Go on! There. And don't let this happen again! What's wrong with the school flag? - What? - What's wrong with it? - The sun! - And? "And?" It's got the sun on it. It's the war flag. The one used by the military. Every school in Argentina uses this flag. Yes, well, they shouldn't have the war flag, but the blue and white one, created by... - Belgrano. - Exactly. I don't see that changing any time soon, so it's stupid to get into a fight over that. Hang on... What's your name in school? So? Yeah, you're right. Come again? Yeah, you're right. Come again, soldier? You are right, Colonel! That's better. Now go polish! Plate, knife... Ready? OK, that's enough. By the way, don't forget to have those authorizations signed or you won't go camping. Can we carry on? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday. Ernesto Happy birthday to you Way to go, Crdoba! What happened? It's my birthday today. Right, October 7th. - Did they say anything at school? - Say? They sang happy birthday and... there's a party on Saturday. What do you mean, a party? They were all singing, even the teacher. They chanted "When's the party?" And I said it. - Said what? - Party on Saturday. Dammit! Couldn't you have said something else? We're throwing a party! Party, party! It's OK. It's only a party. With everything that's going on! I don't want presents. That's not the point, honey. We're not in a party mood now. Don't worry, sis-in-law. Here's what I'll do: I'll make a piata. A shit-loaded piata? No shit. Better fill it with trinkets! - And the cake? - I'll bake it. Why not dress up like a clown? - Hi. - Hi. - For you, troll! - No. - I wanted a word with you. - Me? - Today's my birthday. - So I heard. Who told you? - Wassup, Crdoba? - This troll. - Shut up, stupid! - Go clean up. Hey, what's up? Get lost, will you? No, wait, don't go. I came to confirm my party. You already did in school. - But I came to invite her. - Her? What for? - She said she wasn't going. - I didn't. - You said it was a rug rats party. - Ignore him. Can I bring a friend? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Thanks for the invitation. Bye, Mara. "Bye, Mara." What bit you, Crdoba? Great! Where the fuck's your uncle? Wake up! Where's your uncle? He went to get my present in the van. Listen, kiddo. I'm OK with the party, but you have to help us keep things under control. Sure, Dad, don't worry. These boxes go in my room, I'm locking it. Your friends can't touch the door. OK, Dad. This is important! It's serious. Finally, dammit! - Where were you, Beto? - Wait... I have a surprise. A surprise? A little surprise. Well, maybe not for you. Alright? What is this? Grandma! - Out you get. - Pumpkin! Careful with the head. Like before. Sit down. Perfect. - Pumpkin? - Here. Well done, Amalita. Let me remove the blindfold. Curtain call... Pumpkin, dearest! How big you've grown, my love! So tall! Hello there! How are you? Charo! Come here! Mom! What're you doing here? Vicky, look, granny! Almost a year old? So, what do you think of uncle's present? Asshole! Why did you bring Amalia here? Are you crazy? Calm down, man. I took every precaution. I don't care about the precautions. This is totally against our safety measures! Relax, trust me. I took every precaution. Listen, how many times must I repeat myself? Life isn't a big adventure. You're not a kid anymore! You got it all figured out and executed, Commander! Lower your voice, it's not funny. Chill out, bro. When will you enjoy this? Enjoy, Beto? Cut the crap. Enjoy, brother. Enjoy that we're here, together. Appreciate what we're doing. This is no time to be thrilled, stupid! It's time to be committed! To grow a pair of balls and see this through! - Fuck you! - Commitment, asshole! I've been pulling my weight since I can remember! - Pull it in the right direction! - What's that? This is also necessary and important! Or else why do we do any of this, huh? This is not the time, Beto! Not now. On the contrary. It's now! If I've learned anything from all these years of shit, we're building for right now. Here. With this. Not with this. You're a hopeless romantic. What're you doing there, kiddo? Come, come, hear us out. Come here. - Why do you fight so much? - 'Cause your dad's clueless. Your uncle's a jerk! That's why. A jerk with his balls in the right place. In the right place? An Argentine macho! Run along and pamper Amalita. Run your little show. Oh, so you're pissed off I brought your mother-in-law. You could've said that and spared us the drama. If it bothers you, you should've done without a family! Look at me. Free as a bird. You're an asshole, Beto! - Big Argentine dick! - Asshole! OK... Attention, ladies and gentlemen. Allow me to quote on this fine evening the great poet whose name I can't recall and quote his fine verses: "In and outty, in and outty, Beto's in the house, let's party!" See how I move my hips! What're you all standing there for? Compaero Ernesto, do us the honor of kicking off this party. Yes, sir! A hard choice between all these fine ladies. Who'll be the lucky one? One, two, three! Bravo! That was quick. Who's up next? You. Let me see those hands! A free lady for this gentleman in need of attention. Don't let me see anyone without a date. The night breathes love, matches will be made, couples are being born. Such style! Look, such style! Alright! A drink, Amalita? - Thank you. - Something strong? - Definitely. - Coming right up... - I'll never be a doctor. - No? There, she's asleep. - Isn't she cute? - A cherub. You can't imagine how happy I am to see you. Strange as it is to see you here, I'm thrilled you came. Mom... I know I'm repeating myself... but you can't tell anybody we're here. Yes, I know I can't breathe a word. You're not thinking of staying? I can't say. You can't say, but... Amalita, relax. Let's just enjoy tonight, OK? - Cheers, Mom! - Cheers! I'll be right back. Look, I know... I'm in no condition to discuss... what you can and can't do, you're well aware, but the thing is, with the situation the country's in... Well, I just can't understand why you chose to come back now. I love you so much! Tell me about auntie. - Is she still at home? - I don't want to discuss her. I don't want to discuss what you were discussing. Don't make it harder. Go to bed, kiddo. Amalia, relax. The children and us are alright. I can see you're alright, but... I wanted to propose an arrangement. The kids come with me and you... Are you crazy? They're my children! - They're my grandchildren! - They're my children. - Don't forget it. - Don't insist. You know how she feels. - I won't take orders from her! - Kiddo, why are you here? I sent you to bed. Off you go! What happened? Did I miss something? C'mon! - This is a party. - Right. Cake, anyone? You haven't drunk anything. - Cheers. - Cheers. Horacito... Surely you understand me on the children. I do, Amalia, but it won't happen. Don't push it. Here, Mom. But listen, Horacio, it's risky. The situation's very... Amalita... We're fine, the kids are alright, you saw them, they live a normal life. Normal? You consider it normal for a kid to use some name and have his birthday on some random date? Poor pumpkin! That's normal? Know what I can't stand about you? Your fear, your panic. All your life locked up in fear. Leave, you're in danger! They're killing people! You're such a coward! Dad was right! You never did a thing for anyone! - You have to leave! - You don't know me! You know nothing about my ideas. If I die, I'd rather have compaeros raise my kids than you. Hey, Charo... You want your children to be guerrillas? What's the problem? - Do you know what the point is? - Yes. What? - Getting killed. - Bitch. You bitch! You're just pushing my buttons? Stop it! You must leave! Enough, enough! Lower your voices! No yelling here. Cut it out, both of you. And you're an asshole, Beto. An asshole. Giant asshole, yup, that's me. Let's all calm down. Cool it. Amalita, you know Cristina. You know your mother. So, cut the crap. Amalia... I see where you're coming from. And I see that you never got any of this and you don't get it now. But don't say it's madness, because it's not. Deep down you know it. Horacio... I know you speak from the heart. We've known each other for ages. But I'm scared. And that's fine, Amalita. It's OK to be scared. We're all scared. But you have to leave. It's very dangerous to stay. You have to leave. It's getting late. We love you. Beto... It'll be fine, Mom. - My little darling. - It'll be fine, Mom. I swear it'll be alright. Juan, say good-bye to grandma. My pumpkin. I remember when you were born. Your grandma came to meet you. She was so excited. You were her first grandchild. When I told her we'd decided to call you Juan. She got all worked up: "Juan?"she'd say. "Surely after Pern." It's true. It wasn't very originall Of course we'd named you after Pern. She was never able to call you Juan. So she calls you Pumpkin. She said when she first saw you. You reminded her of a pumpkin. For how long? Just two days. Is your cute friend going? Yeah, sure. Well! There'll be some fishing at camp. Get off my back. Why? Nothing like them! Nothing in the whole world beats chicks. Chicks? Chicks, chicks... Mara's not just any chick. Sorry. No need to clarify, plain as daylight. I'll let you in on a secret. OK. - Interested or not? - Yeah, sure. Take a seat. Chicks are like... chocolate-coated peanuts. - That's rubbish! - Rubbish? It's a secret only a handful of people know. You have to know how to eat them properly. People just suck all the coating and are left with the hard peanut or just bite it right away. It's sacrilege. It works like this. No, slow down! See? You rushed that one. Now swallow it. Here, do exactly as I do. Breathe, deep breath... Now... put it on your tongue. Let it melt slowly. Feel it? Nice, right? Now roll it onto your teeth... and bite it. Taste it slowly. See how those two flavors melt into something else. Not peanut nor chocolate... but chocolate-coated peanut. Got it? Yes, but... what does all this have to do with Mara? What do you mean? Everything! You have to soften chicks up, but not too much. And in my opinion, you are nearly, nearly ready to take the bite. - You sure? - Positive. But how? It's in her eyes. She's ready. Believe me, do as I say and you'll do fine. Thanks, uncle. I wipe my feet I climb and climb to the treetop Fly and fly to the mountaintop Descend. Descend to the basement Swim and swim to the bottom I wipe my eyes I can't see right To the treetop I can't see. I can't see To the mountaintop I can't see. I can't see To the basement I can't see. I can't see To the bottom I can't see What can it be? What can it be? What can it be? I can't see the mountaintop if I'm at the bottom I don't see. I can't. I don't see. I can't So, am I blind? No! You could use a pair of decent folks' eyeglasses Decent folks' eyeglasses You could use a pair of decent folks' eyeglasses Decent folks' eyeglasses I wipe my feet I climb and climb to the treetop Fly and fly to the mountaintop Descend. Descend to the basement Swim and swim to the bottom Land in sight! Finally, the Indies! "What Columbus ignored is that he had arrived in an unknown land: America." Welcome to America! Oh, Columbus! We bring you offerings as... a sign of... - Fra... - Fraternity. Oh, Columbus! Our lands are your lands. Oh, Columbus! Our wealth is your wealth. Oh, Columbus! We thank God and the Queen of Spain for the discovery of these wonderful lands. And we embrace the mission of building a great Christian nation. We shall educate and civilize them as per God's will. Oh, Columbus! Bravo! Take a bow, like true actors. - Shall I touch it? - No. - Are you alright? - Yes. Come here. Want some? No, thanks, I don't like it. You don't? I just don't. How can you be friends with my brother? He's a jerk. What's the matter with him? I don't know, you're different. You're more... More what? Fuck! Such a foul mouth. Know where I'd like to go? Where? Brazil. Ever been there? No. They say the beaches are beautiful, soft powdery sand, like flour. My dream's to go there. Let's go now. Come on! Faster, faster! Look at the palm trees! I'll kill you, fucking troll! Such bad taste, Crdoba! Here, turtle doves! I look cute, right? Sort of. - Shut up. - Sort of ugly. Ernesto! I've gotta run. - I'll keep it, OK? - Yeah, my dad would kill me. Because of a photo? OK, bye. We're in that car. That car? Dad's driving it. Get in. What's going on? Hey, Dad. Hey, kiddo. What's going on? We're leaving for a few days. Safety reasons. Why? What happened? Uncle Beto. What? You heard, love. Uncle Beto. Compaeros, on this sad day, I'd like to remember my brother with the dignity he deserves. He once said to me happiness wasn't about smiling, but about believing, having faith. Believing so hard something is possible that you make it happen. And that's how he lived. He had that characteristic. Though he enjoyed everything he did... he never lost his beliefs. I'm convinced he was happy to his last breath. Here's to my brother's balls! To compaero Beto! Here! - To compaero Beto, dammit! - Here! - Pern or death! - To the motherland! What happened? - These things just happen. - I know. But I want the truth. Alright. We were making a delivery downtown. Everything was under control. As I was leaving the place... I see your uncle with his hands in the air against the van. A cop behind him. I don't know what happened. He must've seen something, he freaked out, started screaming. Your uncle tried to calm him down, but... suddenly it was swarming with cops. Beto made a move. He shouted: "You won't take me alive!" Pulled the pin from a grenade... and pushed the cop into the van. The whole thing blew up. Goddammit! It was all a matter of seconds. But I needed him alive. Who does he think he is? Kiddo... I'm going away for a few days. To see if we can go back home. I'll miss him too. I'll never forget him. Me either. Uncle! What's up, kiddo? Want some? So, how did it go? Sweet! Seriously? I knew it, that's my boy! Didn't I say she was ready? Yeah. So, now? What's your next move? I dunno. What do you mean? You're a big boy now! With Mara, you mean? No, that's already in the bag. I mean your life. I dunno. Is that the best you got? What do you suggest? I can't help you there. All I'm saying is... don't betray yourself. No matter what, don't betray yourself. And you? What happened? Nothing. I've got those fuckers under control. Don't you worry. You won't take me alive! Shoot! Don't move! I've got those fuckers under control. Juan! You have a fever. Let me see. Why? Leave me alone! Why? Easy... Hello? Hello... Mara? Yes. Who is this? Ernesto? Yes. Hello? Yes, I'm here, I'm here. Hi. How are you? So sorry about your grandpa. Yeah, it's too bad. Poor thing. Hello? Are you there? Hi, I'm here. I wanted to invite you somewhere you'll love. What about school? We'll skip school today. - Now? - Come on... We can miss one day. What are you doing? Who was that? Answer me, Juan, who was that? - What's the matter? - He was on the phone. - Who was it? - On the phone? Answer me! Mara. - Who the fuck's Mara? - My girlfriend. Fuck, Juan! Girlfriend, my ass, cut the crap! Just what we need now! Know how dangerous it is to use the phone? - Yes, I know. - So, what's wrong with you? You know you're not going back to school anymore. That's over. Kiddo, you have to help mom pack and suck it up like a man. What am I supposed to stay here for? Doing what, dammit? Hey, calm down, lower your voice. This isn't easy on any of us. No point getting worked up. We have to take things as they come. Easy for you to say. Excuse me? - Nothing. - Cut the crap, Juan. You're a big boy! Bye. Mara! How are you? Fine. So you're back? No, I'm still there, I'm a ghost. Idiot. How was the funeral? Fine, it was fine. - Shall we go? - OK. I have a confession to make. I have strong feelings for you. Here in my stomach. I feel that too. You do? There are things you don't understand, and that's fine. And there are other things you won't understand now. You know? I know I'm not making myself clear. But this thing I feel is real. Remember when you said... I wasn't like the others? That's it, you see. I am who you think I am, only... different. You know? Not at all, but I still think you're cute. I want to be with you forever. Promise? Cross my heart. Look. I have a surprise for you. I've got money, loads of money. So? So we can be together. We can be together forever. We're together now. Yes but we'll be able to go wherever we want. Go? Now? We'll be able to go to Brazil. Brazil? I don't get it. Didn't you want to? Look. This money will get us there. I can get a job in Brazil. I can do all sort of things. Are you crazy? I won't leave my family! What about your family? I love them, but I want to be with you. Kiddo... do you know what I did last night? I sat in your room watching you sleep. Remembering you as a little baby breast-feeding. And to see you now... All those years gone by so fast! You're huge, kiddo, a man. Well... almost a man. I wondered when I'd next be taken by surprise to see you. Perhaps when you're 15 or 20. What do I know? But I want you to know I love watching you grow and you make me very proud. I love you very much. One year after the 1978 World Cup won by Argentina. A team of players from all over the world came to commemorate this day of glory for our national sport. Now. Let's change the subject. The forces of law and order continue their fight on subversion. Very early this morning. A clash with several subversives took place in Munro. The clash occurred when officers tried to stop a suspicious-looking vehicle. The criminals were ordered to freeze. But responded with heavy fire. During the clash.
