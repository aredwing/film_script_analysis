You must remember when well-Known builder ViKrant Narula.. ..committed suicide, there were many rumors maKing the rounds. Some say that he committed suicide as he was debt-ridden. And some say that the room from where he jumped.. ..many people have died in that room. lt's a strange story. clD can maKe five episodes on this mystery. What case is this? How come l don't Know about it? lt's about that hotel. What hotel? Hotel Grandiose. The one in news. Since the time strange incidents have been occurring there.. ..the hotel has been shut down. The owner committed suicide or he died. Nobody Knows. Since then all this is going on. But poor guy. No one Knows how and why that owner died. You never Know the truth. l have heard strange stories about that hotel. So have l. l have heard that hotel is haunted. Yeah. - Many people say there is 'Vastu Shastra' problem.

What? - That whoever comes to that building.. ..she won't sPare him. correct. - Yeah. oh come on, guys. Are we really having this discussion? What nonsense! - Exactly. lt's such a run-of-the-mill story. There was a graveyard under every boarding school. There was a hospital under every hotel. What crap! can we please grow up? Strange compulsion! l mean, if you don't believe in ghosts.. ..it doesn't mean they don't exist. l agree with Maggie. l don't believe in ghosts. Why to fear something you haven't seen? The day you see it, you won't be alive to believe it. Guys, l have a brilliant idea. Let's go to Hotel Grandiose for Neel's farewell. To meet the ghost. She will scare the ghost. Really? - Really?

Sorry, guys. l am not going to leave this room. l am also not going. DrinK anyone? Just thinK, man. There was a time when this hotel was functional. Now imagine. A very beautiful girl.. ..l would say a hot, sexy girl.. ..would have checKed in at the reception. She would have come up from the lift. WalKing stylishly in the corridor.. ..she would have reached this door. After that, she would have gone there. She would have come here and closed the cuntain slowly. Why?

What's that supposed to mean? Are you oKay? - No. Neel, the name of the girl.. .. who is Killing all of us is Maya. She was mentally sicK. She was mentally unstable. Magesh was right. lt was not a rumour. There used to be a mental asylum here. This was perhaps the manager's room. l found this file in one of the drawers here. She murdered her entire family. lt was a family of seven. When she was produced in the count.. ..she said that she had married the satan. And she murdered so many people at the behest of the satan. 'The count, for mental rehabilitation sends her to state...' The doctor who has treating her, she Killed him as well.. ..during a psychiatric session. The doctors and nurses of the hospital were scared of going close to her. And 18 people died due to a shont circuit in the hospital.. ..after a few days. A case was filed. And the hospital was closed down. The hospital was closed for years. And a really big hotelier bought this place.. ..to build a hotel. He built the hotel alright. But accidents happened regularly. And the hotel was also shut down after a few days. And then ViKrant Nirula committed suicide.. ..by jumping off the roof. This is so freaKing crazy. Do you thinK Maya brought Sonia to this room on purpose? So that we could read all this. l feel that Maya is stucK in these walls. And she wants to tell us something. She is trying to communicate. So what do you suggest? Maya. Maya. Maya, we Know your story. l am trying to reach out to you, Maya. SpeaK to us. What do you want from us, Maya? What do you want from us? What happened? What happened? She.. She said that.. She said that.. She said that she only wants to Kill us. She doesn't want anything else. She just wants to Kill us. l had told you. Didn't l tell you? She wouldn't sPare us. She will not sPare any of us. No. - What are we going to do now?. What are we going to do now?. We shouldn't have come here.

We are all going to die. This.. We are all going to die.. Did you ever thinK that this is going to happen with us? our guesses were wrong. She wants nothing from us. But death. Even if we stay together, it wouldn't be of any use. We have to survive. We have to survive. There is very less time left for morning. Neel. What is the time? lt is five minutes to four. one minute. What time did you say? l said it is five minutes to four. oKay? Neel, do you remember the time l met you near the shop at the corridor. lt is very strange. And maybe this doesn't even have any logic. But at that time, every clocK in the shop was showing five minutes to four. And it is the same time now. lt is five minutes to four. That is so strange, Leena. And this is not a mere misconception of mine. Neel is the proof. Do you thinK this has a meaning? Maybe. Guys, liKe deja vu. When we see something and feel that we have seen it before as well. Right? And premonition and intuition are the same. When we can see the impending things early. You Know, liKe a proper visual. Yes? l don't believe it. ls this possible? We will come to Know of it when we go there. Guys, we can be saved. We can be saved. come on, let us go. l was standing here. l was right here. occult. lt is written here that every spirit.. .. is connected with something or human being. And every evil spirit derives it strength.. .. from the thing it is attached to. So assume that Maya gets all her strength from a source. How would we Know that what that thing is? We can come to Know of it. lt is written here. What is written there? There is a chant written here. We have to hold each other's hand and repeat it. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. - unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus. lnfirato Spiritus. concigarato unmelitus.
