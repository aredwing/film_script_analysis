The Ria Station wishes to inform you that the ferry will depart at 8:15 from pier 3. Hello. The Ria Station wishes to inform you that the ferry will depart at 8:15 from pier 3. - I've started. - Take it easy. I'm sweating like a pig. The less you think about it the better. Santa. Santa! Wait a minute. - Your ticket. - Wait a fucking minute. Bastard. You'd think it was his boat. - Very elegant. Got an interview? - At 10:00. - You never give up. - This looks good. Well-paid, expenses, an office. "Own vehicle"...You don't have your "own vehicle." I'll buy one with my first paycheck. Salo's selling his Express. An "own vehicle" that runs. His is in the wrecker's yard. It just says "own vehicle." "Computer skills." My son is teaching me. And look: "112,000 minimum. Plus commissions." "Chances of promotion." Santa, your ticket. The boss will blame me. I said I'd give it to you. Anyway, the service is lousy. I'd swim across faster. With the amount you charge, there should be free drinks. Tell your boss for me. - And waitresses. - Yeah. Not a fish-face like you. Pain in the ass. The problem is there's an age limit. What? No? Around 35. Around there? With that gray hair? Look, it says there, "20-35." - And "presentable." - Aren't I presentable? - Don't make him more nervous. - Lino, they want fucking kids. - Kids don't have gray hair. - Gray hair can be presentable. What you have to do is think they won't give it to you. But that's what I do think. Shouldn't he think positively? - No, you know nothing about this. - And you fucking do? Anyway... we'll see. If I'm gray, I'm gray, and screw all of them. And what is it? The job. I have no idea. PIER 3 They don't know. Maybe, it depends. And they might call me. So it's pretty much a "no." No, it isn't a "no." They might call me. Call you to say what? Yes or no. If they call, it's a yes. Even if they do call, my daughter will be on the phone. It happened once before. They called and the line was busy. How long was the interview? Five minutes. They got rid of you. They got rid of him, Amador. Don't ask me. I don't understand any of that. - See you later. - See you later. It's better that way. Give Amador a drink. We'll drink to "They might call us." Who'll pay for it? You? Have I ever not paid you? Do I owe anybody anything? You owe me 6,000, for your rent. And me 2,000... 2,300, but I'll forgive you of the 300. Nata... They're giving me a hard time, Natalia. How strange, you're so nice! Nata is the only one who understands me. Why don't you and I have a drink someday, without your father? Maybe because I'm 15? Having free drinks is one thing, but don't mess with Nata. Anyway, what's up? Didn't you get enough yesterday? She's... She's pulling your leg. Little bitch. Don't listen to her. Come on, what happened? Quit fucking around, Jose, don't joke around about that. You trust me, don't you? I trust her. Your wife back yet, Amador? Her mother got worse. Bet you're delighted. You've been living it up. In here all day... You don't stray too far from here yourself. Anyone seen Reina? He said he'd invite us to the game. He said nothing to me. What are you doing? It's the tip. Yeah, but that was for me. Get over it, you're still going to get it. I'm investing in your business. - Do they hurt a lot? - The right one mostly. - From the knee down. - Did you call the doctor? When? I haven't had time. Tomorrow. Tell them you have to sit down. Yeah, I'll ask for a massage too. Fat chance. God, eight hours on my feet. At night too. The bastards keep changing our shifts. For those shitty wages. One day, I'll tell them all to fuck off. The company and the boss. He's a creep. They can stick their fucking job up their ass. The cream? It's there. I like you, Rosa. Monica. Monica. Tell Mom I'll call her. I'll call her tomorrow. You know you can't bring women into your room. She isn't a woman. She's my sister. That's even worse. It's from the court. Have you done anything wrong? No, but don't worry, I'll let you know. Australia. Australia is fucking great. You know how many square kilometers it has? Ten times this. And the population? - No clue. - Less than half of Spain. Just figure it out. Figure out how much. Here we don't do shit. They give you what's yours. They do? When you retire. It's a law they have. They divide it up. They say, "Let's see... we have so many kilometers of country divided by however many people there are." I don't know. Let's say, two square kilometers or three. Whatever it is. And they give it to you. - Each one gets his share. - Shit. Can you imagine? Here, this is for you. It's yours forever. And you can do whatever the fuck you want. And so people are in a better mood. Because of the climate too. It's great there. The Antipodes. The Antipodes. You know why they're called that? Because it means "the opposite." "Antipodes." Anti-podes. The oppo-site. The opposite of here. You can work there, not here. You can screw there, not here. Antipodes. I bet those bastards are going there right now. What day is today? Monday. If I may, Your Honor, I'll read the statement in which, on November 4 of this year, in accordance with the decision adopted by this court, the accused was found guilty and sentenced to pay compensation to the claimant for breaking the streetlight, model Urban Swimlight 270, located eight meters from the shipyard entrance. That was accepted at the time without any argument. But we would like it to be seen in the context of the labor dispute prevailing at the time, a lockout and the layoff of 200 workers, among them, my client, which meant that he and many others joined the demonstrations with which we are all familiar and which ended with regrettable confrontations between the workers and the police. - Bastards. - Consider, therefore, the events surrounding the incident for which my client is being asked to pay compensation. But it wasn't the streetlight's fault. That's true, Your Honor. But it was badly placed. So it's all the fault of whoever put it there. Perhaps... it could partly be seen like that, Your Honor. Counsel, this is the third time we've heard this case. What is the compensation being demanded? - 8,000 pesetas, Your Honor. - 8,000 pesetas. How can I pay it? How can I pay it? They laid me off. And now they want me to pay 8,000 pesetas. What is this? I pay them for laying me off? You broke their streetlight? Well, now you pay for it. A lousy streetlight. No, it was an Urban Swimlight. I won't pay it. Santa, this was the third hearing. You know what the fourth means. Do you know, or not? What do you think? It isn't a matter of cheap or expensive. It's cheap for you? Fine. But not for me. Is Jose ugly or handsome? That depends too. His wife might like him. The 8,000 pesetas, for example. What are they worth? - In euros? - In pesetas. What are 8,000 pesetas worth in pesetas? - 8,000 pesetas. - No. No. You see? For me, morally, they're worth much more. - 10,000? - Much more. 10 million. More. 100,000 million. How can 8,000 pesetas be worth 100,000 million? - Morally. I said morally. - All right, morally. It still doesn't seem expensive. It must be great to be on TV. Imagine presenting a program. You go on, talk a bit of rubbish, and live like a king. - You know what he gets paid? - I was on TV once. In an ad, when I was a kid. I was a good-looking kid. What was it for? A soft drink. "Bubbles." Remember it? Orange and lemon flavor. "Bubbles"? Doesn't ring a bell. - They went bankrupt very soon. - Shit, Lino! "Bubbles." Never heard of it. Give me another. It's your fourth, Jose. Don't worry, I'll pay you. That's not what I meant. Want anything? You got "Bubbles"? Orange or lemon? Orange, please. You assholes! I was on TV too, during the shipyard layoffs. Is anyone still there? It was open on Monday. They're auctioning the machinery. The bastards. Careful with the crumbs. If the foreman sees them, I'm finished. - Lino, here. - Get it out of there. Don't screw up. - You're going to lose it. - Get it out. - You're going to screw up. - He's on his own. Back him up. - He's screwing up. - Root for him. - Kick it over, come on. - That's it, move up, guys! - Go on, move up! - Look at him! He isn't looking! - Was that Ferrer? - We need two more floors, Reina. You had a great goalkeeper. What was his name? Yasine? - Yashin. - Yashin. The Black Spider. Best goalkeeper in world. He always wears black. Everyone is afraid of him. Opposing player, when he scores goal, apologizes to Yashin. Ball is also afraid of Yashin. He deflects ball with look. This needs to be welded. - Do you need an expert? - Why, do you know one? Official first-class welder. Four years in the yards. Come over here. Who wants cheese? - Be careful with the crumbs. - I can't help dropping them. Put your hand underneath it. Stop nagging, Reina. It's getting on my nerves. Yeah, you're like my wife. I'm like your wife? If I belt you one, I won't be like her. You could tidy up my place. It's a mess. That's because your wife works. What's wrong with you, you're a smart-ass, huh? I just said she works. And she does, doesn't she? - Yeah, what about it? - Nothing. - It seems to bother you. - It does bother him. Look, look, look. Shit, I can see nothing. Next time, go to the grandstand. I won't invite you. And you, put that down. Can I take it until Tuesday? Take it? You want to get me fired? You've got lots. There's another one. Put that drill down. Do I have to frisk you on the way out? Calm down, Reina. Don't pull your gun on me. Now, now, now... - Move it up! - That's it, very good. Go on, move it up. No, kick it in, kick it in! Kick it... Goal! Goal! I bet it was Salva. He's very impatient. - He gets angry at anything. - It's the uniform. - He was always been a bit like that. - No, believe me. It's the uniform. - I haven't seen him recently. - He goes to other bars now. Don't be a dick. It goes out on its own. It's a time switch. What time? Time. What time do you think? The only one there is. That's shit. It costs more. So what? You're not paying. It's Jose. What's he doing here? What's up? Nothing. I'm meeting Santa. How are your legs? Is that why you came? Get back in line. - Can't I talk to my wife? - Don't, Jose, please. - He's an asshole. - You want to get me fired too? Ana! Does he know everyone's name? I'll see you at home. That son of a bitch. He can't live without you. AURORA SHIPYARD That's one ugly son of a bitch. They should have paid me for breaking it. I like it. Yeah, but you've got no criterion. You know what criterion is? If you don't know what it is, how can you have it? It comes from the Latin, criterion. And... it means that... criterion. The word itself tells you. Hello, Bizco. What's up, Jose? Have you come to work? - You got a lot to do? - No, just junkies who sneak in. It's very quiet here. Look. - Is anyone up there? - Alberto. Have you got criterion, Jose? - Criterion? Where did that come from? - I don't know. - If it isn't here, it's gone. - I need it for the bank. What year did you leave? '97. Statement of tax deductions from 1994. And the list of preferential employment. All the paperwork is over there. If you want anything, self-service. - What about the computer? - We're not linked anymore. When do they start building? Don't ask me about that, just about papers. Can you do them again? No, I can't. If you were here from '94 to '97, Imagine trying to find them all now. What about shame? Have you not found that yet? We could bring 200 jobless families to help you find it. Go to head office and talk to them. Don't give me a hard time, I didn't take anyone's job away. If I went to the head office, there'd be fucking murders. Did he know we were coming? We'll wait a while. You saw the excavators. The show house will be ready in six months. They'll need permits. They'll get them... whenever they want. Look, there he is. Were you out shopping? What are you doing here? Keeping an eye on you. Your wife told us to do it. - I'll take that up for you. - I can do it. - It's four floors. - Let go, for Christ's sake! I'll do it myself. You got someone up there? I'll be right down. He's getting really moody. I'm off... to work, to maintain you guys with my taxes. I'd rather not work than work as a cop. Watch it, I'm not a cop. "Security technician." Can I pay for these? See you later. Amador, has your wife come back yet? She's coming on Monday. - Want another, Jose? - No, I've got the bank tomorrow. - For the loan. - Will you get it? We'll see tomorrow. - Aren't you late? - I need money for the cab ride home. They're going to stop asking you. Are you babysitting? Got your books? My notes. Call me, if you need anything. If there's a problem, call us. Don't worry. His supper is in the fridge. You have to heat it up for him. - Can you use a microwave? - What do you think? No, but anyway... Put him to bed at 11:00. Don't give him candy or beer or anything. He's only four. He can't see TV. Don't talk to him about politics or girls. My cell phone. They're due at 2:00. I'll be here at 1:45. What if they call? I've rerouted the calls. That's for you. Three? Wasn't it five? What about my commission? That's how the world works. Get used to it! Who are you meeting? A guy. You weren't free. Tell me when the movie ends. If there's any fighting or groping, change stations. You know where to press? - Here. - That's it. Very good. This whiskey is terrific. This guy's got good taste. We all have good taste. What he's got is money. I wonder what he does. Can you imagine living like this? What's this kid's name? Jorgito... Luisito... What's up, kid? What does your father do? Russian story says: Two old party comrades meet, and one says, "All that we were told about communism was a lie." The other says, "Yes, but the worst thing is that all we were told about capitalism was true." - What did you do? - I study in Gagarin Space School. - You're kidding. - Many astronauts learn there. I study 27 program of Soviet Union. I, in space now, exactly... there! Between big star and little blue one. But my program stop. Soviet Union kaput. I am here now. That's life. Did you know the Russian was an astronaut? - What's up? - Nothing, I'm serious. He should be up there now. Hell of a change. I know what this guy does. He makes shoes. - I opened a closet, it was full. - You opened a closet? They're his wife's. - These people have lots of shoes. - Why did you open it? - I was investigating. - Investigating. - Don't dramatize it. - I'm not dramatizing. We're here under my responsibility. If anything disappears or anything happens to the kid - I get the blame. - The kid could have his head stuck in the oven and you wouldn't notice. You're here because I invited you. Got it? And you do as I say. It's my house and my job and my child. Yeah, but we're helping you, aren't we? With the child. - We're all looking after him. - What are you babbling about? Lino is right. So we should all share the money. The 3,000 pesetas? What else? Do you want a contract too? Have you all gone crazy? - Where are you going? - To put the child to bed. "The Grasshopper and The Ant." Here we go. "Once upon a time, there was a grasshopper and an ant. The ant was very hardworking and the grasshopper was not. He liked to sing and sleep. While the ant went about his tasks. Time went by. The ant worked and worked all summer long. He saved all he could and when winter came the grasshopper was dying of hunger and cold while the ant had everything." That ant is a real bastard! "The grasshopper knocked on the ant's door, and the ant said to him, 'Grasshopper, if you had worked as I did you wouldn't be hungry and cold now."' And he didn't open the door! Who wrote this? Because this isn't how it is! That ant is a piece of shit and a speculator. And it doesn't say why some are born grasshoppers. Because if you are, you're fucked. And it doesn't say that here. Will Ana like them? Of course, they're beautiful. They're not kind of weird? She wears a size smaller but with an insole... Look, look. Come here and look at this. Look. Look. - I have to get up early. - Didn't you want to be on TV? Look, look. Look. Good evening. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to "Guess who is the biggest dickhead I know?" Tonight, it's a very close competition. On my left, in a checked jacket which is way out of fashion, Paulino Ribas, unemployed and weighing in at 80 kilos. And on my right, another considerable dickhead, last week's champion, Jose Suarez. A big hand. - Can I play? - No, you can't. This is for Spanish dickheads. Send your name and your telephone number to whatever fucking address you want. - I don't have a phone. - I'm out of here. First question: How many hours is Australia from here? Let's hear your answer now. - By plane? - No, swimming, asshole. - 10 hours. - 10! Serguei said 10 and he's an astronaut. He can't answer because he's not here. The question is defaulted. You've lost. - What did I lose? - You have just lost a wonderful job with 14 paychecks, a secretary, with promotion opportunities in Torrevieja, Alicante. Jose! Wait! I'm ready! And that's not all. You like them? Very much. Fit for a princess. Chosen specially for you. I can go to the bank alone. We could be there for an hour. I'm sure I'll have to sign something. Don't put any more on, you don't need it. Stop it, I smell like fish. You don't smell like fish. You smell like a mermaid. Go on, take your shower. Now... A personal loan. Your paycheck stub? She's the one who works. Great. - Permanent contract? - Temporary. Monthly net earnings, 110,000. Any bonuses? No bonuses... Any other source of income? Anything supplementary? Well, well... Can anyone act as guarantor for you? I can. Someone with an income, a relative, your parents... Is it necessary? It helps. Is there a problem? - The ad said it was easy. - You know how ads are. I'll need a copy of your marriage certificate. Sign here, please. The one who's employed. All right, then. In 10 days, we'll give you an answer. Why did you put it there? Excuse me? Why did you put the form there? That's its place. - And that pile? - Jose, please. Why not throw it straight in the trash? - A committee will study it... - Committee, my ass! You think I don't realize? We don't have money, so you think we're retarded? I'm sorry. Thanks, Jose. You've been a big help! - There are a lot of banks. - What? What do you think this is? He was laughing at me! He wasn't laughing at you, or at anyone. He was doing his job. He can stuff his job up his ass! - What was that, a trial? - Yes, it was. And if they like you they give you money. You don't like it? Then you're fucked, that's how it is. No, fuck them. Nobody puts me on trial. I don't like their money. I don't want it. It was me asking for the loan. I'll decide if I like their money! Right, I'm not the "employed person." After all, who am I? Nobody, a worthless asshole, someone they can laugh at. I knew it. I should've come on my own. Yeah, that's right. You all on your own. You work, you ask for the loans. Great. What about me? Jose, I knew this would happen as soon as I saw the whiskey. Right, you know everything. What happened, what will happen... You're so smart that you're filling cans of tuna. It's more than you can say. - Can't you just be quiet for once? - We can go to another one. Another one? What for? To insult them too? It's always the same. Look at us. We've got nothing. No house, no kids, no loan, nothing. And it's always because of fucking work. Are you awake? I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. and 47. And the complementary number is... Good morning. Maybe for you. JOB SEEKERS Look. Whoever wants to suck me off, raise her hand. Do you know her? From the other day. If they can't give us a proper job we'll take a blow job. What can I do? Put yourself in my place. They were to send you the dismissal form. When did you sign it? - When I signed the contract. - That's impossible. You can't sign the dismissal form and the contract together. But they were together. What you have to do is go home and wait. An inspector will visit you and decide about your case. Meanwhile, we can't pay you any benefits. - I've brought the certificate. - That's of no use to me. You have to wait. But I can't wait. Samuel, I can't do anything. They'll ask for proof of dismissal. You call her, please. Call my wife and tell her. See what she says. Tell her about the inspection, the dismissal and everything. Tell her and see if she understands. Please, see if she understands. Anyone call? No. Has she gotten over it yet? More or less. She says she has, but she seems a bit strange. What does she do? Nothing. She doesn't talk. - She doesn't talk? - Not much. And she thinks all day. That's bad. - Hello. - Hello. I thought you were Swiss because of the dress. I'm not Swiss, the cheese is. - Want some? - Yes. I warn you, I'm a cheese expert. Sure. Have you been there? Switzerland? No, have you? Skiing. No, I'm joking, working. How is the cheese? Not bad. But I like you more. What's your name? Angela. Spregel. Swiss for "my pleasure." Spregel. All right, "spregel." - May I? - Of course. Want some of Angela's cheese? - I'll go and pay. - Right. It also means "goodbye." I'm going out. - Again? Where? - For a walk. - For a walk where? - Around. Leave him be. The question isn't whether we believe in God or not... the question is if God believes in us. Because if He doesn't, we're screwed. I don't know if I'm explaining myself. I think he doesn't. At least, he doesn't believe in me. Nor in you, Santa. In Jose... he might believe in him a bit more. I don't know. But we believe in you and that's what matters. Yeah, but you aren't God, for Christ's sake. Serguei, does God exist, or not? Do you see Him when you were up there? - Serguei is an astronaut. - Really? When Gagarin comes to earth after first trip a journalist asks same thing, if he saw God in space. And Gagarin says, "Yes, I saw Comrade God in space, and He told me to tell you that He does not exist." Give me another. I'm closing up, Amador. It's late. When's your wife coming back? If she doesn't come soon, you'll kill yourself. What the hell is it to you? Why are you talking about my wife? Do I talk about yours? Give me another drink. All of you can go fuck yourselves. And God doesn't believe in you, for your information. - In none of you. - Don't be angry. And in you least of all. I didn't fall. I threw myself down. Take him home. Give me another. Wait, wait. Come on, Amador. It's... you can't. You can't. You can't? All right. No, because there's no ticket. What do you mean? To get into your house? What are you talking about? A ticket. - You got a ticket? - Yes, yours and mine. - We'll go up and I'll show you. - You don't have a ticket. They won't fucking let you in. We'll buy them upstairs, come on. No. You can't. Like Siamese twins. They fight, the dickheads. What Siamese twins? The Siamese twins. You know, Siamese twins? No, I don't. Do you? Yes, I do. Siamese from Siam. With two heads. They hang onto each other as they're born, because they're afraid to be born. And then, afterwards, they can't separate. - They fight? - They fight, and one of them wins. He pushes the other one, who falls. And he laughs. But he's falling too. Understand? Because they're stuck together. The two of them fall, you understand? It's as if he said, "Go fuck yourself." You understand? Go fuck yourself! Go fuck yourself! You understand? Shit, Amador. When your wife comes back... The light! Be right out! Jaime Marques. Paulino Ribas. Pay it, Santa, or you'll get in trouble. What does the lawyer say? That I should pay. What if you don't? It's not certain. Jail time, as well? Who knows! Depends on the judge you get. You'll have no girls in jail. And who will bring you food? I will, Santa. Thanks, Nata. The idea is to see who's better looking, you or them. Don't worry, you'll win. I'm not going to pay. I can't. I'm sorry, I just can't do it. I can't. That's it, then. Let's have a last drink with Santa. A farewell drink. Christ, all this dignity! Here, half a streetlight. But don't get used to it. Some of us work for our money. What's up, Lino? How did it go? All right. Give me a drink. Go on, Reina's being generous. What are you doing? It spilled. You're an asshole, Santa. And full of pride. Yeah, I guess I've been like that for years. I won't change now. Right, Amador? Spregel. Spregel. Very elegant. Yes, well, business... Is he yours? Do you like children? A lot, a lot. What's up? You lucky little fucker, you've got Angela! That makes it easy. Are they his? Yes, we're going to the doctor. His arm hurts. Are you a doctor? More or less. I worked in a hospital. In the bar. And you always pick something up. This looks fine to me. This week I'm working evenings. If you want to drop by... Have you ever been to Australia? Australia? - No. - Would you like to go? - Right now? - No, not right now. Whenever. You all right? and 8,000. That's it. See how easy that was? Have an easy night. You did the right thing, Santa. They were the ones who didn't. But they can go fuck themselves. You did what you had to. Straight ahead. And you did it well, with style. You want 8,000 pesetas, take them, there they are. Have a drink on me. It might not seem so, it might not seem so, but these things add up. They make you grow. Here. In your head. And you look better, more mature. Stop. Here? I won't be long. What the..? Much better. No, no way. It's easy to be the victim. There is work. If it's there for outsiders, it's there for locals. - And it's there for outsiders. - All right. No, it's not all right. Every month a chunk of my wages goes to pay a bunch of bums. It's easy to hold your hand out? Lino, he says you're a bum. Don't involve me. You are involved. He says that if you wanted to work you'd go to the south, earn 80,000 pesetas a month, spend half on lodgings and send the rest to your wife. - I wasn't talking about him. - No? About who, then? Shit, it isn't that hard. I say you can always find something. Look at Rico. They close the shipyard, lay us off and what does Rico do? He takes his severance pay and sets up this bar. And it's going okay, right? How long ago was that? Three years. Yeah, but it could have gone badly. That's bullshit. Not if you work hard. Amador. Amador left at the same time. - What did he do with the money? - Wait a minute. Firstly, he didn't leave. He was laid off, like all of us. They're two very different things. As for severance pay, like a lot, but then what? What do you do at 49 with no job, two kids, and 8 million in the bank? I'll tell you what you do, you do nothing. In four years it's gone. I mean you, Amador, anybody. And they gave me nothing. The problem was, it was cheaper to buy the ships abroad. I'll tell you what the problem was, because I was there. They said, "We're laying off 80. Accept it or we're closing down." We said no, it wasn't closing. Our jobs were there, and everyone else's job, and you don't mess with our jobs. And it wasn't just casual workers. You were there, Rico. And so was Amador. Defending what was ours. Mine, Jose's, and Lino's, for he was there too. There were 200 of us at the sit-in, casual and permanent workers. Ask the police, I'm sure they remember. And you achieved nothing. We made sure people knew about it. They've all forgotten now. And we were united, I haven't forgotten that. Then it got all fucked up. It's easy for you to talk, you didn't have a family. What about the men who were 50? Who would hire us? All right. You signed the agreement, I understand, but you knew it was shit. You did, didn't you? - There was nothing else. - Nothing else. Fucking great. Is there anything else now? You guys left a year later. You got this bar, it's doing well, I'm delighted. But others haven't been so lucky. Amador, for example. Yeah, but that isn't my fault. No, it isn't, but you all signed the agreement. They laid us off then, and you guys the year after. And what happened? What happened? We weren't united anymore. They divided us... with that fucking agreement. If we're divided, we're screwed. It's always been like that. Always. That's why some of us did okay and some of us didn't. That's why Lino keeps calling his poor wife saying he doesn't know, and maybe they'll call him. That's why I'm getting a fucking lousy temper. All right, but one thing is clear, I come to this bar, but if it's cheaper anywhere else, I'll go there. It's the same thing. If the Koreans build ships cheaper, then it's... I don't want to hear anymore about the fucking Koreans. This shipyard was competitive. We worked fast, damn it. We even offered to do free overtime with lower pay. The thing is, the shipyard is where it is. The site's worth a fortune. Why? Because it's next to the sea. Haven't you seen the excavators? They'll replace it with luxury apartments and the fucking Koreans will come and live in them and laugh in our fucking faces. It's as simple as that. And I wouldn't go anywhere else even if the drinks were free. I'm going to keep coming here. Even if you did sign the agreement. I could get a job serving drinks tomorrow. But there's one thing, if everyone gets laid off there'll be no customers, and that pisses me off even more. That pisses me off. You signed our kids' dismissals. Their jobs were at stake. And we lost them. Pour me another. Very nice, Santa, but that was two years ago. Since then, what? I haven't seen you serving drinks. At least Lino tries. And good or bad, I've got a job. - A "security technician." - That's right. - You like seeing the games. - I have to imagine half of them. So stay at home next time, asshole. Come on, Reina. It's true. He does nothing, but everything's wrong. Sure, they're going to come here looking for you and offer you a job just for the hell of it! We don't all have a brother-in-law to help us. Listen, dickhead, he had left the company when I joined. I got nothing handed to me. I'm a worker. - You're an asshole with a gun. - Oh, yeah? You seemed keen to find a job there. Your wife wanted to have me near. What? Asshole. You went too far. He should shut up about whether we work or not. Fuck it, Santa. You don't care, you don't like soccer. # It's wrong of you # # To make me nervous # # To crush my ambition # # Keep on like that and you'll soon see # # Where is our mistake that can't be solved? # # Were you the culprit or was I? # # Neither you nor anyone can change me # # 1,000 bells are ringing in my heart # # Is it so hard to say you're sorry? # Nata's too much. You could fucking tell. No, you just think that. It was everything. The way she laughed, the way he touched her hand. He likes your wife, it's natural. What do you mean? - Shit, you like her too. - That's different. All right, but it's normal he likes her. Your wife's hot. - Do you like her too? - Of course. What's the big deal? If she's hot, she's a hot. It's normal that we like her. Hey, you're talking about my wife. I agree, she's your wife. At least you agree with me on that. I agree with you on everything, but I disagree. I'm sure it's nothing. They're friends, they work together. It's normal. - He took her hand. - Her hand! Big deal. Why didn't she tell me? Because she knew you'd be angry. Ask her. Talk to her. - I'll do that. - Good. It'll reassure you. I'm going to talk to her. Two more drinks. Listen Jose, to talk, you have to go home. - Not order another drink. - Yeah, right, but I have to think about what I'm going to say. - What if she leaves me? - She won't. Yeah, but if she does? # This is the story of a dream that made me happy # # Because when I dreamed it, it touched my heart... # Look at Lino. # Along a path of blue painted in the sky # # Because little by little # # It lifted me up # - Come on, let's go. Come on. # I was flying # # Oh-oh # # I was singing # # Oh-oh-oh-oh # # Along a path of blue # # Happy among clouds of tulle # # I was flying up to the sun # # And I picked a bunch of stars as I passed # # While I left the unhappy world far below # # And sweet music played just for me # # I was flying # # Oh-oh # # I was singing # # Oh-oh-oh-oh... # Talking... it's important. It's how people understand each other. Yeah, talking. Talking things through. Are you leaving? - Hello, Santa. - Hello. - I was waiting for you. - I got held up. So I see. We have to talk. About what? Later, all right? - So long. - Bye. - She wants to talk. - That's good, right? You wanted to talk too. No, you did. I wanted everything to stay the same. And it will. Want one for the road? I can't. See you tomorrow. You meeting somebody? The cheese girl? He looks happier. Any word of his wife? Your Colleagues on the Board What's that? A wreath, can't you see? Who sent it? The Royal Household, who the hell do you think? Your Colleagues Sorry. How was it? All right. Normal. Nobody went, just us from the bar. Did you call the doctor? I can hardly feel them. It's as if I didn't have them. Mermaids don't have legs. Do they know what happened? He was drinking a lot. He used to have it under control. He was always in the bar. Then he'd go home. Or someone took him. He was on his own. Santa told us, he went up with him once. His wife had left. I guess she got tired. It's normal. But he said nothing. Not to anybody. He'd drink and go home. No one was waiting for him. That's why he never wanted to leave. Maybe he didn't have the strength to go on. Or maybe not. Maybe he fell. What difference does it make? Anita... What's wrong? For example, to exit, Control Q. You use Control, you go up... and Enter. Clear some space. How's it coming? Carlos Fuentes. Paulino Ribas. Paulino Ribas? Sergio Esteban. EXI And it was starting to look so nice. I've seen the lots. For the auction. No, it's a raffle. Among the workers. I got number eight, I think. Yeah, eight. What about you? Get out of here. Really, I'm coming tomorrow to pick it up. Which one did you get? - No. - Yes, there's a list inside. - Really? - Really. Go and see. Go and see. Go and see! No. You're missing out. I'll get yours. Yeah, right. - What are you doing? - Christening it. Christening it. THE SHIPYARD It's really ugly. Don't be sad, Nata. He's happier now. What'll we do with it? We could leave it in his corner. Yeah, or beside the fucking ham. - He spent his life there. - Up beside the trophies? - What are you doing? - One for the road. - For Christ's sake. - It's Amador. We're pals. Na zdorovye. - The bastard. - He didn't say anything. He did. But he was hard to understand. Like... like Siamese twins. They're stuck together. We're stuck together too. I didn't say that. Amador said that. If one falls, we all fall. And if one gets fucked... that's it. So do the others. Because we're the same thing. The same thing. Like Siamese twins. The same thing. It's locked. Oops, it broke! Right, get the others. We're off. Can you navigate this? I worked on a ship. - In the kitchen. - Yeah, but on a ship. Shall we start? Where's the urn? - You had it. - No, Lino did. You were holding it. In the bar, then Rico gave it to you. No, he didn't. - Yes, in the street. I saw him. - No. Weren't you with Rico? I don't have. You haven't left it somewhere? - I never touched it. - You always lose things. I might fucking lose things, but I wouldn't lose a pal's ashes. Poor Amador. What day is today?
