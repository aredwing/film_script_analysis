Open them in order of date. ...and put those you can't fix on my desk. ...make sure the red post they go to the boss. ...and don't try to open them. FAIR LOVE How is Jae Hyung doing? I bet he is good with his hands. When did you know that? Well, Nam Eun called me last month. Nam Eun? Gi Hyuk's daughter. ...remember that you took pictures at her graduation? Did he have a daughter? Don't tell him about any stupid things. I didn't cheat anyone. How can he contact us just before he dies? Knock it off! He cheated me out of more of my money. By the way, what's the name of his disease? Liver cancer. He's got something to tell you. About what? I don't know I'm terribly sorry. Shut up! I don't want to hear that. You, son of... ...you can't imagine how miserable I was. I am so sorry. ...but you're a good friend. whenever you have cheated me you have said that. You are truly my best friend. I mean it. I have been around you. ...for 8 years. I wished I had appeared before you at my best. It is 8 years already. I never meant to hurt you. ...never... Thank you so much for coming though. I feel more sorry... ...for Nam Eun and you. Please take care of her. Just... ...check how she is holding up. ...for me please. I have no regrets in life except her. She is living right near where you once lived. You can find a milk box next to a name-plate. You won't miss it. That's the way it goes. we impose a heavy burden. ...on our favorite people. we do bad things to them. And always end up owing big things to them. That's why we come to lose. ...the bigger one. That's the life. This is so typical of you. This is so you, son of... You shouldn't have turned it on. You asked me to do so. It wouldn't have broken if you had listened to me. Please remember 'Penny-wise and pound-foolish' Bring the bigger bucket. You got to fill the bucket and wipe down. What happened? We've got the leaky pipes. Why didn't he come out of his room? Jae Woong, what are you doing? Are you going out again? I've got a blind date I have to leave now Just let him go. You always run away... Get out of here! Hey, you! Wash the dishes before you leave. Can you please take my pictures again? What for? I need them for work. I am always thankful. You came. Oh, yes. Did you bring your laundry? It's so shameful to ask you to do that. It's ok. I can put them all together into the washing machine. I already did. Why didn't you show up at the funeral? I've been busy working. Busy or not, We all must attend a close friend's funeral. Once I start fixing a camera... I must finish it. You cant' lose a little tiny part. That's such a lame excuse. I heard Yoon will take care of Nam Eun's school expenses. She lives right by your work. ...you could stop by and see her. Is there any way I can help her? Is she that young? She is emotionally unstable she has been running away. Though she has a lot of potential. He haunts me from the grave. I've got a call from the Contact guy. Ok... It must be photographer Kim. He is not a photographer. Sunee, Sunee... What are you doing, man? What do you think I am doing? You always give me the cold shoulder. Business is good enough to hire a new worker. Hey, new worker! You got to treat the camera you got to treat the camera. I'm not a worker but his pupil. Who the hell is my pupil? Don't be upset, my friend. Who the hell is your friend? You are not even 40 yet. You are in a touchy mood today. Did you get my camera done? I need to check the test shot. Fixing not shooting is your job. Shooting is my job. You... Well, I just... Did you come and see me? What? Do you remember me? Sure... I took some pictures at your graduation. Sorry for coming late. No, it's all right. Is this milk to drink? I've lost two family members in a week. I barely cried when my dad died. I cried more when my cat died. I guess I am a bad girl. No, you are not. People are just like that when their dads die. It takes time to notice. ...the absence of a father. Really? Yes. Why is that? Because we're usually... ...more grieved over the loss of someone we give love to. ...than the loss of someone we're loved by. That's why. we're more sorry when we lost our children than we lost our parents. You are not married yet. No, I'm not. So, how do you know that? My dad used to tell me. The stupid guy has never been in love. The stupid guy he meant is you. Yeah. I am the only one that stupid. I'm sorry. It was a slip of the tongue cause I'm so absent-minded. That's all right. Oops! Are you ok? Well... I'm just fine. I will give you another outfit There are plenty of dad's. Never mind. He got all these from place to place. They look all right. Are you wearing a scarf even at home? I easily catch colds if I keep my neck cold. Why don't you try this on? I was wondering where it was. It's mine. It's yours? That looks like mine too! My studio is just around the corner. Bye. I know You know? I saw it whenever passing by. Your dad asked me to stop by you. ...everyday... ...before he died. You don't have to. Well, ok. I mean that you can do it if you want to. Isn't it heavy? Let me carry one of your bags. Nam Eun, how old are you? Twenty five. You are already... You don't remember me. Yes, I do. I remember taking pictures at your graduation. You seem to have grown up so suddenly. I was all grown up many years ago. I'm not disappointed that you don't remember me. I mean... We haven't seen each other for a long time. ...you were not interested in me. ...and you hated my dad, so... That's not true. I never hated your dad. Just have a seat. I have been wondering what it is like inside. I never let anybody touch that area. You are the first. It must be good to be someone's first. Right? Yes. You were in the newspaper. I didn't know that. Do you live here alone? Well, I used to stay at my brother's place. But it was uncomfortable. You could be living in a good place now without getting swindled by my father. Getting swindled was my fault. I feel a mysterious attraction to skilled man, especially to those... ...skilled with these complicated machines. If I was left home alone when I was young. I was afraid of machinery. My room was so small and old that I could here only the sound. I didn't even know the machines. ...or how to operate them. But I could hear the sound so well. ...someone who knows machines is mysteriously appealing to me. It's nothing. Well... If you say so... ...it's more appealing to me. The machine's mechanism is not complicated. Whether the parts are simple or complicated. ...you can fix anything once you know how it works. What are you doing? Wait a second. Please make my image reliable. ...and good. Then, you had better get cosmetic surgery. She seems to... ...have feelings for me. You are such an easy mark. I'm so nervous. No, she said... whenever she is in difficulty. ...she thinks about not her boyfriend but me. That's so ridiculous. She only finds you when she needs you. Meanwhile, she will be back to her boyfriend when she doesn't. No, it's not like that. Please tell me it's gonna be fine. Her boyfriend doesn't seem to have any feelings for her. So she will be extremely lonely. Keep saying it's gonna be ok. You have been repeating yourself for 3 years. It is premature to carry out my plan. Now... Right! I have to remind her. ...that I am always there for her. It's gonna be fine... Fine... Then you remind her that forever. I am so sick of your story. Why are you freaking out? I am freaking out to listen to the story for 3 years. Why the attitude? I'm not your friend. I brought this. Isn't it too big? It's ok. You have to share it with them. It's not far. Why don't you come and eat. She just makes faces. No, I don't. She is like a ghost. I just... want you to stay here. Why do you live like that? You can get a small apartment with your savings. It's only me. You are not allowed to touch there. I just wanted to listen to music. I clearly told you not to touch my desk and anything here. I've been with music since I was young. I am terribly sorry. Let me put it in the fridge. Where is Jin Tae? He had to go to the hospital. Hospital? His wife is delivering a baby. Time flies too fast. Am I interrupting you? Who is she? She is my niece... Actually, my dad took away your clothes. I should have returned them after washing. No, you shouldn't have They are still clean. - Are you really ok with that? - Absolutely. Then... If you say so... I will wash them. when they get dirty. So long! How old is your niece? By the way... What my dad asked you to do... What? You can do that if you are willing to. I mean... He asked you to stop by me. Never mind. Nam Eun! Hey, Nam Eun! You... Sorry to let you go like that. Well, listen... Anybody can visit my studio anytime. But you are not just anybody. I think I spoke like a jerk. I was so embarrassed. So you were saying? My dad asked you to visit every day? Yeah, he did. If you ever need something... I mean you can tell me if you need me. I am so good at doing the laundry. You will be very surprised. Oh, yeah? You must be proud of yourself! Can I hang around in the studio? Well... You will be bored. There is nothing but cameras. There is nothing in my place. ...and my cat died, too. - You came back! - Yes. Make yourself comfortable! Your niece came back, too. Oops, you can't sit there. Never mind! I see she is your niece. Hello! So did you get my Contact done? The work is piling up so you have to wait a little longer. You said to get it done by this week. I've got so much work to do. Please come next week. What day? Someday next week. You said that last week. Hey, what's up? Yours is not ready. No problem, take your time. See you next week, then. Where is Jin Tae? His wife has given birth to a baby. He must make lots of money. Let's eat something. Why don't we order some food for your niece? 'Bei Jing' is newly opened. The service of 'Great Wall' sucks So shall we order food at 'Bei Jing'? Yes, lets. Why don't we get something expensive? I said yes! - Here is 20 bucks - Thank you! Wow, the service here is excellent! It just opened so the service is great. - Please help yourselves! - Thanks. wow, they even put dressing on the fried dumplings. Really? We will definitely order from there again. - Throw them away from 'Great Wall' - Yes. I knew this was coming because of their bad service. Please help yourself. They look delicious! Let's eat. Congratulations! Have you had something? No, I had no time. Why didn't you stay with your wife? What a mess! She is with her father as well as my parents. At least pretend to be happy, uh? I just worry about what my dad said. A fortune teller gave my baby a name to be rich. What? Like what? Kim Daewoo, Kim Samsung Kim Hyundai. He said People with these names can't be starving to death. I was speechless. You can ask your dad to call a baby Kim Microsoft. That's not funny. Your niece is fond of you. Your niece? She is too pretty to be your niece. I'm going home now You can stand by your wife tomorrow You can't handle all the work. without me. He can count on me. Why don't you take him now? So long. See you tomorrow I will see your niece next time. Isn't it boring? My dad used to tell me about you. whenever we were passing by. I always imagined what it looks like. It looks all messy and stuffy. I think... You are attractive. You are attractive. ...the way you walk and the way you talk. ...are lovely. I find a man who works very hard sexy. You little girl... I am a friend of your dad's. I said I find a man who works hard sexy. I didn't mean you by that. You don't have a boyfriend or something? It's not the best place for young kids to hang out. It's boring to hang out with friends. Then as a student you should study hard. And you'd better start preparing for the work force. It's high time to get ready. Besides, tuition fees are very high these days. Mr. Yoon is paying for it. Being 25, you should be independent. You will be exactly like your dad if you are not. It's true you hate my dad. Do you think I will be starving to death? No, I just want you to be more realistic. Mr. Yoon is paying for your tuition fees until the graduation. You will learn life is not that easy. What are you gonna do after graduation? You should act your age, 25 You sound like a father. But my father never sounded like that. He used to tell me 'I run a successful business' 'I will buy a sleek car' Even if he was running away. He was full of hot air until he died. If you pile up like this they would smell like a sponge. Oh, yuck! A cloth has its life. ...so it might go any minute. How can't you know this? I mean you keep the studio so neat. Why don't you put them back... Why do you insist on doing this? The whole studio will stink. Don't you think you must clean your own room? Do you know why I don't? We've been running away since I was born. ...and creditors used to. ...turn our place into ruins. That's why I don't. Are you sure you can fix all the machines? Yes. As long as you know how it works. We gotta fix the washing machine to do the laundry. How much money did my dad owe you? Did you have that money? It was all I had. Leica's only rival is Contact. whose history is longer than Leica's. The distinctive features of Contact are its fast and sophisticated lenses. And its shadowing is great. And it's body is really strong. You can drive a nail with this when you don't have a hammer. You gonna break it up again. Then you can get it fixed again. A few can disassemble and reassemble this. Only a few masters like him can do it. I've finished fixing M3 Already? You've improved a lot since you had a second child. Cool! Let's take some test shots! Jungseok! Let's go to the beach. Let's go to the beach and eat sashimi this weekend? I'm allergic to fish. You can eat clam noodle soup. I think I have to be with my wife. Nam Eun, don't you like sashimi? Let's go to the beach this weekend. - Beach? - Yes. I really like clam noodle soup. I get it. Let's go! Come on! Come on, man. Come on! I saw a pretty bus stop just before. Please take a picture of it. You mean that? - Do you want it? - Yes, I do. - Do you really want it? - I want it so bad. I will do that for you if you say 'oppa, please' Oppa, please! OK You can't be oppa. Yes, I can I'm still in my thirties. Then you can't be my friend. I don't seem to get drunk on the beach. - Aren't you allergic to sashimi? - It's the only thing I can eat. What a flexible eater! Where are you going? Get some more clams! What are you, Stieglitz? Stop taking pictures of clouds. Get yourself here! Are you familiar with Stieglitz? He is known as the father of modern art photography. Repairmen don't need to know about photographers. We should learn the basics Knowledge is power. I miss the time when you were not knowledgeable. - Catch you later - Bye. Let me take you home. It's not too far from here. It's late, get in the car! Come on! Let me pick up the laundry now You pick up the laundry this late? Are any launderettes open yet? It's right there. - I am leaving now - Ok. - What's wrong with you? - What? You seem very strange today. That's just me. Now I get it. You just... If something is different you always find it attractive? I mean, like a different bus stop. ...different way of talking. ...or walking... I don't know what you are talking about. Never mind! I said I don't get it. You just tell your side and close the curtain like this? I was wondering. ...if you find something different attractive. Are you mad at me? Why would I be mad at you? Because I was getting along with other guys. Do you think I am your friend? I am a friend of your dad's. He just asked me to take care of you. They were his last words so... You can't do this to me. If you keep doing this to me... What on earth did I do? You said I was all grown up. I don't find any of them attractive. I've seen many people like them. They really like that. ...if I pretend to find them attractive. They just want me to like them. ...irresponsibly... So I just pretend to. But you are different with them. ...not that kind of person. Can you come tomorrow? My TV is broken again. You don't have to come if you are busy. She is 39 and owns her academy. She is a devout Christian and a devoted volunteer. She is a real spinster. Look at yourself! Do you want a 20-year-old girl? You are lucky not to meet a widow I am not interested. You don't even deserve You are too old to meet a young chick. Wake up! Think of your age. I can set you up with my friend. Are you crazy or something? Why not? Girls my age like old guys. They really like old guys? What's wrong with you? I mean, rich old guys. What are you doing here? I'm kind of busy. I wanted to ask you something. ...about the Bible. Really? What? What it says about love? In 1 Corinthians Love is patient and kind... That's a lyric. ...it's from the Bible. See? Read it here. Love is patient and kind love is not jealous... There is nothing easy. That's the way love goes. People have more difficult lives then you. Do you stop by her? What? She is emotionally unstable and she has been running away. Please take care of her. - He went out - This is ridiculous. - We have so much work to do - How many times have I come? Here he comes. You promised to finish this week. I'm playing catch up. That doesn't make any sense You can't keep holding me up. I'm taking care of it now You've kept me waiting for weeks and only now you are doing it? Sorry for the inconvenience but He was backed up. Please understand that. ...perfection takes time. But this is too much. You shouldn't have said that. You are just wasting my time. Sorry for the inconvenience, effort. But things can't always go right. ...as you expect. Now it's ready. And sometimes things can go right. Are you jerking me around? It only took a minute. Shit... Even if he was so freaked out You are the only one. who can fix it So he can't go anywhere else. - Jin Tae! - Yes? Do you think love can cross the borders of. ...age, gender, etc? Where did that come from? Are you considering an international marriage? I believe love can cross the borders of. ...race, age, and culture. You can marry an alien. Will you shut up if I raise your pay? I know your financial situation so how can I ask you that? I just get pissed off when he opens his mouth. I saw you getting out of the studio. You did? I guess you should prepare for the working world. I know what I have to do. You don't have to do my laundry when you are busy. I can ask a sister-in law to do that. It takes no time to do laundry. But I don't want to waste your precious time on washing. - What is your major, anyway? - English Literature. English Literature... Is it easy to get a job with a BA? I don't study it just for a job. You don't? Well, do you want to be a professor? - You will have to study abroad - I'm not interested. Don't be silly. You will graduate soon. Time and tide wait for no man. You know my feeling. You are just pretending not to know I don't know what you are talking about. You know my feeling but you would not understand me. You are so bad if you pretend not to. Nam Eun... You know everything! Why don't you open your heart and see? What's wrong with me? What's going on? So strange... Did you drop anything. Even a great master like my boss can make mistakes. What are you doing now? Every day is one of those days. I'm just trying hard like you said to. I signed up for an English class. ...and I am seeing guys my age. You are doing great. But I am so bored. They are so boring and dull. This guy is tall and smart. And he has his own car. He has a real big car even though he is only a student. But he turns me off. What are you talking about? Are you with a guy now? Like what you said. I'm not joking. - You talk to him - No, don't do that! Hello? I'm having a blind date with Nam Eun. She asked me to tell you this. I have the looks, the car the character. ...the whole package. But she feels I am a greenhorn. Well I've never met someone like her. Ok. He wants to talk to you. Hello? Where are you now? I will be there. Let's talk then. Why? You don't have to come. Near school... What are you doing here? This guy was just an average professor, but. After falling in love with a young pupil. ...he so inspired that he became a great architect. And? Nothing. Never mind. They think you are a professor. I want to say... I know what loneliness is. You've lost both your father and your cat. So you need someone to rely on. If you don't believe yourself and that's it. Don't try to make an excuse. ...don't let me meet someone else, either. It's like you make lions eat leaves. Yes, I am a coward. That's how I am and I can't change now I can't start something new I'm responsible for my own life. You have your own life. ...and I have my own life. Why do think we will lose something? I can't do this anymore. I am not disturbing you anymore. I'm leaving. Hello? Yes. You are not coming back? What? Of course I respect you. Even if I did something immoral. Would you still respect me? It depends on how immoral. I did it because I loved her. Can you marry someone you love despite anything else? I can marry an alien. An alien? As long as the alien is sexy. He said as long as she is sexy. Did you run all the way? I missed the shuttle bus. In my entire life I've never hurt another. But there are many bad guys out there. Like swindlers and wicked people. I am not talking about your dad anyway. What do you want to say? I mean I don't want to hurt either myself or others. I've thought and thought. ...its not like hurting other people. I mean... I don't see any problem if we meet each other. You like me and I like you And we are not hurting others. You know what I mean? You are bad at proposing. But I ran 100m all the way down here to say this. What are you doing? Fixing a Contact. Let's do it your way. Well... Considering how people view these things. ...if you keep calling me Mr. Kim. ...holding hands in public. People will look at us with disgust. So why don't you call me oppa? I should have considered it first. Don't worry. From now on I will call you oppa. Oppa. Do you have any unforgettable days in your life? Remember today. Remember this moment. It's May 19th, 2006 Why are you calling me out? You don't listen to confession? For that you need a catholic church. Please, just listen. You? Have you sinned? No, I haven't. Then why? Don't be picky. There's nothing I can help you with. Just do me a little favor. ...if you have sinned hold nothing back. But I am too shy to let it all out in front of you. Then I insist you go to a catholic church. But it's so embarrassing You can do it for me. I can't, It's beyond my ability. Even for your best friend? Ok, whatever. Let's do it. Do it. I am sorry for yelling But you do me a great service. Hearing confession is not an after-sales service. How can I start? I don't know Just admit to all your sins. - Go for it! - Ok. I remember that. I fixed it late on purpose if I don't like the customer. - Isn't it a sin, right? - You are mean. Even if my sister-in law washed my laundry. I backbit her. You're pathetic Go on! And Mr. Yoon asked me to hire his nephew called JaeHyung. I sometimes want to give him a hard time. You are narrow minded! Keep going! And I don't know if this is a sin or not. I fell in love with someone. I mean this is eros love. ...not agape love. Her dad asked me to take care of her. I didn't see this coming I just fell in love with her. This is not the same girl I know? Yes, she is Nam Eun. You son of... Are you crazy or something? You priests can't use any abusive language. ...it's not abusive language just words between friends. Then you say 'you son of' in front of the believers. Don't beat around the bush It's not the point. What would you do with her? What's the problem with that? A single guy and a single girl can love each other. - You are an old guy - Still single. Right! But it's totally impossible. Why is that? Hello, sweetheart! Sweetheart? I intended to say no. I got an unexpected call from him. I just said yes in my bewilderment. JungSeok kept asking me out to lunch. He said he would wait for me in front of the school. I said I can't but he was so persistent. What for? I'm coming now Sweetheart? You can't call her like that. I really appreciate that. Now I feel relieved. - NamEun, get in the car! - HyungMan. Why did you give him your number? I didn't, he just found it out. He didn't see us! Okay He's gone. I want that. Can you sell it? I wish we had a car. You said you were going to get a new car. So what? Sell it for 750 I can sell it for 1,500 Why do need a car? You're stuck in the studio. If something is broken let's call a repairman. If you can fix it why would I waste the money? I've got someone. What does she do? She is attending school. What school does she attend? - She is a student - Oh, my god. You, son of... Have you lost your mind? Why are you seeing a strange girl? She is not strange. Do you remember GiHyuk who swindled me out of my money. - She is his daughter - Jesus! You, son of! It gets even worse! Let me get some water for oppa! Oppa? You make me crazy, oppa? You are out of your mind. You are so helpless Dude? What a friend we have in Jesus. Why don't you curse me instead of a hymn? You deserve it! Why the attitude? Is that true? About what? About Nam Eun. Yes. What's wrong with you? Did you hate GiHyuk that much? Why are you doing this to his daughter? You can't do this to her. You have to promise me not to see her again. Why? You don't have to come. You can' be her father. And you can't be her boyfriend. Why are you doing this to a little kid, Why? Nam Eun... ...is sexy. Are you a pervert? She is cute and childlike So you may fall in love with her. I totally understand that but... You can't find her sexy. Are you sure? You sure I can't? No one can do this to her. She is such a pitiful girl. She has had a hard life because she was born poor. Well... You think she is GiHyuk's daughter. She is just a woman to me. I can't help it She just looks like a woman. Listen! Your boss must be crazy. I thought this is what your cat did. I'm getting my own car. I do this when I get stressed. Do you feel better when you do this? The Priest came here and prayed for me today. Are we making mistakes? Maybe... Were you a close friend of my dad's? Would it be okay if you had not been his friend? I wouldn't have been that close if I had known this would happen. Can you be there for me forever? Forever? Then I have to live longer than you do. I mean you have to be independent. Nobody can take care of you forever. You could have had 2 children if you had married early. At least my dad did lip-service to me. That's why he is an asshole. He was so irresponsible and. ...made many people so hard. Don't talk about him like that. He is my dad. Can't we stay together at my place? Mr. Yoon is paying for your living expenses. It would be awkward if I stayed here. And with my income. It'll be impossible for us to find a place where we can stay together. Fixing cameras can't be that lucrative. Why don't you become a photographer? You can make lots of money after you become famous. I heard you are much better than most professionals. That's not true. Actually, it would be impossible. It would be impossible for you to date a friend's daughter. Did I tell you that I'm getting a car. You wished we had a car. I couldn't be happier. HyungMan, is that true? Are you really dating her? You haven't had anything, have you? Congratulations! I can't believe you are with such a young girl at your age. What happened? It's not going well? That's how it goes, man. It's not that easy. May I give you some advice? Will you just shut up and feed yourself? Women have a menstrual period. ...they are so sensitive at that time of the month. So if you don't understand her. ...just think she is on her period. I'm well aware of my wife's. Don't try to count the dates. Just think she is on her period when she becomes hysterical. We don't have to try to understand women. Just do good to them. It will be working no matter what happens. That sounds weird but persuasive. Hello? Yes, sweetheart. Have you eaten something? I really hate to hear that sweetheart. Sorry for acting so weird. You must be tired. ...but I was being selfish. No, you weren't. I'm sorry too. You know I'm not good at this. Can you stay over tonight? If you want to. Tonight? I don't want to push you. NamEun! When you use the washing machine. You have to press the power and the start button at the same time. Press the power and the stop button when you turn it off. Understood? Why? I don't know why. How is it fixed when you don't know why? You don't have to know ever 'why' Why are you trying to teach me something? Because you have to know Do you have something to tell me? Nothing! You don't even listen to me. I do. I was listening to you. You were just pretending. You told your side and closed the curtain. No, I didn't. Is it that time of the month? Can you quit fixing things? And do what for a living? You can be a photographer. You've got talents and abilities. Do you want me to be famous. ...so I can look good to others? Forget it! You don't even try to make things work. You always ask me to study and to be independent. You never try to change yourself. You said you are attracted to a man who is good with his hands. I didn't mean you have to change your job. I'm done. Already? I feel like a genius with cameras. JinTae was a much quicker learner than you. It can't be possible Please say it's not true. What's wrong with you? Nothing. You made many mistakes after dating her. Hello? HyungMan, what are you up to? I'm fixing cameras as you well know You must be busy I will talk to you later. Something to tell me? No, I guess you didn't look at the calendar. What is she talking about? Why do I have to look at the calendar? Did she ask you something? No, she didn't. It looks like her birthday today. She wrote all the anniversaries. ...including her cat's death on it. I am mindlessly busy I feel like I'm raising a daughter. You should think of her as your own daughter. What? Even if you don't understand your girlfriend... ...you can understand your daughter. But I already told her I can't see her today. That's why you should go. You should bring some flowers. Go ahead. Hello. Are classes over? Yes, can I come to your studio? Right, you said you are busy. I'm mindlessly busy today. I'm so sorry but I didn't know it's your birthday today. Never mind. Dating someone who was never in a relationship was my mistake. Oops! What a surprise! I came here for you right after the call. I didn't expect to see you Who taught you these? I've never done this before but I know how to do this. Telling me you've never been in love before must have been a... I should have brought you a present. I am touched just by your being here. Where did you learn to do this? It's the tip of an iceberg I learned a lot. You have to fix 100 cameras to pay for it. Don't worry about it. What do you want me to do? Whatever you want. I hate my twenties. This age seems so immature. I wish I could grow faster. I am so immature yet. If I'm with you Would I be like you? Would I spend my life fixing the same machine? Do you mind it? I don't mind it but. I'm afraid to spend my whole life like that. There is nothing that is truly special. The more you experience the more banal the world becomes. I would study abroad if I had a chance. Why? I wanna learn what I'm missing. Can you afford it? That's not the point. Don't you know what I mean? I know what you mean, but... You can't afford it. You are hurting me with this talk. It's true you don't have any money. Why are you upset? I just told you the truth. I'm well aware of that I have no money at all. But what you keep saying is that. I'm so young and immature. No, that's not what I'm saying. I just told you the truth. You wanted me to be independent. Studying abroad doesn't mean independence. How long are you going to wander? And what would be different if you studied abroad. So what do you want me to do? I'm not good with my hands like you. I'm trying to figure it out but I don't know what to do. Do you think life is that long? After you take. ...several troubled times in your life you also would've become of my age. You have to find out what to do and when to do it. And this You've learned after wasting your life fixing cameras? I want to see everything with my own eyes. Huh? So what? So you want to go for something new, funny, and mysterious? You are already tired of me? Do you know you are more juvenile than I am? Life is short. Time flies like an arrow and you will be my age soon. You should have planned this when you were 17 What else do you want to learn now? It wouldn't be different even if you studied abroad. I didn't say I would. I'm just asking your opinion. Stop pushing me to find my own life and to be independent. You're always criticizing me. ...and take no responsibility for us. Even if you are with me now ...you would soon forget me. If you studied abroad. You would start a new life there and not remember us. So our relationship will soon be over? It's like a temporary thing quickly changing to another? Now I get it. I didn't know you are thinking like this. Last night, she said. ...she broke up with her boyfriend. I decided not to do this. ...so I just tried to soothe her. But she didn't stop crying. I told her I had to go to work the next day. Please. Stay with me tonight. I have to work tomorrow She said I am a fool. ...and started crying. Are you a fool? My heart was broken. To hear that you're a fool? Yes. You are not tired of the story today? No, I'm not Go on. I was happy too. And she asked for a walk. It was little bit chilly. She just hugged me tight. Because it was chilly? It was not like that. I was so confused with her behavior. She asked me to buy some fireworks. She cried. ...hugged me. ...burnt the fireworks. - At those moments - So... She called you a fool. You watched the fireworks and you fell in love with her again? Tired? No, no. Uncle HyungMan. You used to be sick of this story. No, I'm not. Why you don't answer the phone? What do I have to do? You don't have to do anything. Do you want me to follow you abroad? I'm not talking about studying abroad. You still don't know? Then please tell me exactly what to do. I'm not telling you what to do. I just want to love you more. ...and I want to know you better. You never get out of your studio. So what do you want from me? I don't want anything from you. I didn't ask you to become a famous photographer. When you get out of the studio. Get out of yourself. I expected to get a chance. ...to develop each other and share. But I always feel lonely. Even when I am with you so lonely. I am afraid to be like you. I'm still young. So don't ask me any more. Once you get older. ...you can no longer change. Boss! Are you ok? Did you drink last night? You should get medical check-ups at your age. I'm fine. You don't look fine. Would you listen to the results? The doctor said if there is anything strange. ...you should go in for further tests. I'm sick too. ...yet I'm taking care of sick friends. If the doctor says you need another examination. Just try to think you got a vacation. ...it was my fault. ...to ask you to take care of her. No one could have imagined this. Mr. Yoon said he would have her study abroad. You just pretend not to know it. I don't want to admit it but. It's a man-woman relationship. I know It's not my business. But this isn't right. She reminds you of GiHyuk... Hey! Why you don't answer the phone? HyungMan... Why? I didn't hear it ring. I knew you were gonna do this. Why have you come into my life? I was so strange and different that you wanted to try me on? Like some new fashion only to be discarded next season? You must be happy cause you can study abroad. Why did you come to me? I was doing great on my own. HyungMan... Idiot! Idiot... NamEun, are you there? I was wrong and I'm so sorry. Are you listening? Don't go anyway. I can't live without you. I've never done anything like this. I bought a car because of you. I wanted to give you a ride. I bought these for you. I thought you might like them. Watch this! Here we go! Can you see them? Ouch! NamEun! Can you see them? NamEun! This is it! I can feel it! We're still testing, it's not ready yet. What are you talking about? The Customer's happy with it why these unnecessary tests? Here we go! Cool! Let's have a smoke break. This is so much drama. Why do we need to be outside? He is the boss. Did you get some sleep? Yes. I stayed up all night. I'm sorry. Let's just say goodbye. I am not mad at you or anything. I was being so selfish. I told you not to expect too much from me. I shouldn't have asked so much from you. I'm sorry, I will do my best. I'm not mad at you. You told me that, too. You're never gonna change. You never get out of this studio. I really loved you, it's true. But I don't see any future for us. I really tried my best, too. ...as long as I could. I could stand anything as long as I could be with you. It's not working. I will try. ...my very best. I will be better for you. You've done so many good things for me. It's my fault. It's not your fault. ...because you can't change that easily. I think when I get older, wiser. ...and more independent. I will see you again. You know I can't meet anyone else. I was so wrong. You can study abroad if you want to. I never said I would. This isn't gonna work. I can't. Has she left? Timing is so important. It's too late for you to do this. If you feel sick just drink some juice. Boss! You are so pathetic. Don't do this. Uncle HyungMan. What's the matter? It's nothing. Uncle HyungMan. She came to see me yesterday. Why are you looking at me like that? All right, go on. She came to see me during lunch. She brought some food. She had never done it before. She made it with all her heart. Let's get to the main story. That means she wants something from me. I thought about it very carefully over lunch. Do I have to tell her or not? So did you? I just said I loved her. And her reaction was bad? It's not like that. The moment. I told her I loved her. I realized that. I didn't. Let's just get drunk. Let's. Sorry for you guys. You guys have a hard time. Sorry for you guys. I was so cowardly. Sorry for JinTae. Sorry for Jungseok. Sorry for Jae Hyung, JaeWoong. I was so cowardly. Everybody is having a difficult time. Everybody is... I am sorry. I am so sorry. Mr. Kim HyungMan! Why did you bring it to the hospital? I have to finish with it. Just try and get some rest. You didn't call her, did you? I don't know It's none of my business. But let's just act our age. There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear. What is that? I don't know why these words came to my mind. You are a priest, so you have to know about the Bible. Do you have to know everything when you fix something? Why is the camera here? You should get ever test done. Just get some rest. Anything else? - What? - Anything else you want to tell me. Not from the Bible. But from your mind. The seed of ever sin and pain is fear. Are they from your mind? They just came up. I don't know if they are from my mind or not. How long have you had digestive disorder? Well, I don't really know It's your body. I found out something strange on your X-ray. It's 50/50 right now Just try to stay positive. I haven't slept in days. I've been up late studying. ...and had to submit my reports. It's been so hard. You have a habit of... Rubbing your face. I found out why. when you are so exhausted. I didn't know anything about you. - Aren't you allergic to sashimi? - It's the only thing I can eat. What a flexible eater! Where are you going? Get some more clams! I may change I may get dull of mind ...and you might change yourself Nobody can have a perfect life ...at any given moment Everything in the world ...is 50/50 Let's start over Let's start over Let's start over Get some more clams! Who are you, Stieglitz? Stop taking pictures of clouds. Get yourself here! Let's start over. Let's start over. Let's start over.
