Now round here where I live, everyone's heard of Jason Locke. He'd just done a five stretch for armed robbery. Been outless than 24 hours. Mr. D. had asked me to drive him about for a few days, so I said, "Yeah, sure. " [ Chattering ] [Narrator] We pick up this van, and Jason says... he wants to look up an old friend who he knew from before. [Chatter Continues] You squealin' git ! You fucker ! You want some, huh ? Yeah, you cunt ! Please, no more ! Fucking grass ! Come here ! Leave him alone ! You fucking grass ! - This is what you get. - [ Screams ] Fuckin' grass ! Get in there ! [Man Screaming] [Screaming] Oh, my face! Shit. My face is burning up ! [Screaming] [Pounding] [Screaming Continues] [Pounding] [ Screaming ] [ Grunting, Groaning ] Come on. Let's go home. [Narrator] And that was that. Job done. Jason needed a new shirt. The geezer needed a new face. [Narrator] Next, I take him to his mate's place, which he's been hearing things about. Fucking bastards. Lisa ? I've seen his house. He's taking the piss. Nice, isn't it ? Oh, yeah. How'd he get that sort of dough ? How'd he stay out of prison ? [Bottle Cap Hits Floor] - You want egg with this ? - No. Yeah, go on. - Would you like anything ? - No, I'm all right. Ta. He had a Porsche and a Bentley, the bastard. What, a Porsche now ? That must be new. - What about Wayne ? - Oh, he's got a five-series BMW... and a nice little three-bedroom house in Billericay. [ Mumbling ] It was a fucking mansion-- great big drive, electric gates, fucking statues of lions on the gate posts. - You could have told me. - What, spoil the surprise ? [Narrator] Anyway, so look, I'm thinking, "It's been a really interesting morning. Thanks very much. If it's all the same to you--" - And then he says, - Gonna need you some more, Billy. - All right ? Later on. - And I say... - Yeah, sure. - And that's it. I've got the job. Your girlfriend won't mind, will she, Billy ? You have got a girlfriend, haven't you ? Yeah, I got a girlfriend. She won't mind. Liar. [Man] One-nine. Yes, that's right. Mrs. Knight for Brentwood. [Man On Radio] Yeah, one-nine. Yeah, on my way. - The geezer grassed him up. What else could he do ? - Oh, yeah ? I ain't sayin' he should have gone that far, but you know how it is. Oh, he just sounds like an animal to me. They should put him back inside, do us all a favor. He's just done a five-year stretch 'cause of this mug. - I'd have done exactly the same thing. - That's you, is it, Billy ? You could do that to someone ? In principle. [ Chuckles ] Billy, don't get involved with this bloke. [Billy Narrating] See him, Peter, oh, he's the top boy. He runs the show. Him, Wayne, does whatever Peter tells him. And Jason-- Well, every firm needs a mad acidbath murderer, don't they ? What do you think of my hair, Billy ? - You look like a fuckin' poof. - Fuck off ! [ Laughs ] What ? [Jason] Fuck of, will ya ? It's all right, isn't it ? It looks really, really fucking stupid. Can't you go any faster, Billy ? I'm racing in the back here. I thought you were supposed to be Billy fuckin' Whizz. [ All Laughing ] It's all come from the doors. You run the doors, and you control what get inside. Clubs don't give a shit. Just don't want any aggro. Most weeks now, we're... turning over 20 grand. - Yeah ? - Mm. - [ Snorts ] - Fucking hell. We, uh, do a bit of weed in the week maybe, but pills is where the money's really at. I keep away from them when they're on them. Fucking eyes all go wonky, don't they ? He's done 'em, soppy nuts. I won't touch 'em meself. They're not for you, Jase. They make you wanna love everyone. I love you ! [Bottle Breaks] [ Coughing ] Pull in here, Billy Whizz. [Techno] [Jason] What's happened to the Honeycomb ? Half a million on a refit, and it's now called Blondz. - Packed every night of the week. - Is it still ours ? No. They gave it to that prick, Perry Elley. Perry fucking Elley ? Yeah. It's him and us now, Jase. That fucking wanker. He was knocking out dodgy Sierras. Yeah, well, he's moved in on the doors now, like us, 'cause that's where the money is. Every door he gets is one we could be making money from. You know what I'm saying, Jase ? Billy. I want you to pull up outside in exactly five minutes, yeah ? - Sure. - Don't fuck about. You make sure you're right outside. [ Car Radio: Techno ] [ Techno ] [ Car Engine Starts ] [ Phone Beeps ] You all right, Nic ? All right, listen, darling, I don't think I'm gonna be back till about midnight. Yeah. No, it's nothing like that. No, I'm just waiting for 'em outside Blondz in Southend. You know, the one with the glass. -[Woman Screaming] - Nic, I gotta go. [Man] Bloody hell, they've thrown him from the bloody window. Leave him ! Fuckin' leave him ! [ Screaming ] - Go forward ! - [ Screaming ] Go forward and run the bastard over ! We ain't got time to fuck up about. [ Screaming ] [Sirens Wailing] Careful, Billy Whizz. -[Tires Squealing] - [ Siren Wailing ] -[Tires Squealing] - Fucking amateur ! Shit ! [Billy] Oh, God! - Get down. - [ Siren Wailing ] You are fucking Billy Whizz. Yeah. Let's move. Well done, Billy Whizz. You did all right. Yeah, nice one, Billy. What do you think of the barnet, Billy ? - It's all right, isn't it ? - Yeah, it looks all right. See, I told you. And this boy knows what he's talking about. Mm, pair of fucking poofs. [Jason Laughing] [ Softly] Nicole. Nicole. Oi, look. Ta-da. Ta-da ! [ Chuckles ] You said you was going to be back at 12:00, Billy. I know. I'm sorry. I've had a right result, though. Look at that, 500 quid. That's for one night's work. - Where are you going ? - I needa wee. So, what happened ? Well, it just seemed to go on, and I couldn't get away. If I'd known you was going to be out all night, I wouldn't have bothered coming around. - I'm sorry. - I've got to pick up Candice in a couple of hours. Yeah, but that's 500 quid. It's not bad, is it ? That's just for driving them about. And I tell you what, they're well pleased with me. All of a sudden, I have just become Billy Whizz. It's like Billy Whizz this and Billy Whizz that. - Better than cabbing, isn't it ? - o you mind ? Sorry. -[Toilet Flushes] - They'll want me again tomorrow. Thank you very much. Come on, get into bed. Warm me up. Make yourself useful. [Billy Narrating] The following night, I'm out with them again. Pete Chaseruns the security at Dantes, which means I don't have to queue up with all the other mugs, - which is nice. - [ Murmuring ] Billy Whizz, come on, son. You're with the A-team now. [ Murmuring Continues ] [Techno] Who's he, Billy ? Oh, my God, that's Jason Locke, isn't it ? He's just come out. did she ? It's a simple question, and I want an answer. [ Exhales ] Why'd you have to ask me ? It's insulting. No is the answer. Absolutely not. No. did you see her spending time with anyone ? Come on, Jase. I just told you. That I know of, she didn't mess around. What do you mean, "that you know of" ? Hey, Billy Whizz, come over here. Stay there. How you doing, Billy ? - Not too bad, Mr. Chase. - Call me, Peter. - All right ? - Are you Jason ? Yeah. What you gonna do when you've finished with Jason, go back to cabbing ? Er, yeah. I mean, I thought I might do the knowledge. - You know what I mean, do it properly. - That's a hard game, that. All them fuckin' tests. Sloggin' about onmopeds. Goodluck to you, boy. Well, you've gotta do something, ain't ya ? I don't like to see anybody work when they don't have to. And you're a bright bloke, Billy. We've been very impressed with you. Very impressed. We'd like to make you an offer. How about when you finish driving Jason around, you don't go back to cabbing ? How about you stay driving for us ? - What, you mean-- - I mean, you work full-time for us. What's the matter, Billy ? You saw a few things last night, Billy, but, er, well-- in my book-- makes you one of the boys. Yeah, but you know I'd never say nothing about last night, don't ya ? Oh, yeah. I know that, Billy. I know I can trust you. It was either that, Billy, or we stick a knife in ya. Bing. [ Laughs ] did you speak to Peter about the business ? Pete's me mate. Yeah. You tell him you want to be his partner, not his mate. He'll sort me out, all right. Look. I know how theywork. I've been watching them. There's too many people in the chain. What fucking chain ? What are you on about ? -Jason ! - [ Chuckles ] Anyway... he's given me some spending money. It's in me pocket. It's five grand. A thousand a year-- that's all you're worth to him. That's just for starters. Anyway, what was I supposed to do, grass them up like Chippy ? Oh, no, he knew you wouldn't do that. You were a sure thing. Yeah ?And what about you ? You're asure thing. Yeah, I'm a sure thing. Yeah ? Well, you waited for me, did ya ? All that time for five years, did ya ? didn't let anyone inside your knickers while I was away ? What's brought this on ? Wh-Why didn't you just say no ? Why did you have to fuck about being clever ? Why didn't you just say no ? Because I was at it all the time. I had so much cock I started a cock factory-- big, fat, small, short. - Anyone bought me a drink, I fucked them in our bed. - Shut up ! - Shut up ! -Just for the price ofa drink ! - Shut up ! Shut your fucking mouth ! - [ Screaming ] Shut up ! Fucking shut up ! [ Crying ] Why do you have to ask me ? Because I'm a jealous fucking bastard, and I don't trust you. [Sobbing] I'm sorry. If I was gonna mess about, I'd have done it a long time ago. Yeah, I know. [Sobbing] Jason. I waited for you because I believe in you. I don't ever want handouts from them again. We can't go back to how it was before. [ Softly] You get in that bedroom. You get in that bedroom. [Billy Narrating] I get a call from Mr. D. I mean, strictly speaking, I'm still working for him. He's asked me to pick up Henry and drive him to this place. I've never been there before, some farm. I just thought probably not a good idea to tell Jason and the others... about where I was going that night. [ Gate Clangs Shut ] [Billy Narrating] Old Henry Hobbs never said much. - And when he did, hes till never said much. - [ Man On Phone, Indistinct ] Switch. [Billy Narrating] The pilotis Mr. D. Wow. Dropped it down sweet as you like, just like he said he could. This is fucking fantastic. - Can touch down and be in the air again in less than 30 seconds. - Right. The other chap is Peter Chase's big rival on the club scene, the infamous Perry Elley. You just keep yourself wrapped in cotton wool for awhile and we're home and dry. [Billy Narrating] Mr. D. and Perry had been hatching this one for months. This was the final dress rehearsal. Boys, this is gonna work. [Billy Narrating] So, John Dyke-- Mr. D. -- he was the one who got me into this. I was doing me cabbing, and I picked him up one day. We had a little chat and got talking, and he asked for me again. I used to deliver things for him, packages, and drive a few people about. But I didn't ask any questions. I think he liked that. [Bird Squawking] What do you make of Jason ? I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of him. He's an 18-carat nutter. - He's kept you busy. - Yeah. Actually, um, him and his pals have asked me to do a bit of driving about for 'em. Well, full-time. How do you feel about that ? I don't know. Thought, "Why not ?" I mean, they're all right. They look after me. - I wouldn't mind seeing where it'd take me. - [ Sighs ] I can still do a bit of driving for you. That's no ta problem, is it ? Well, good luck to you, Billy. do you think it's a bad idea ? It's not for me to say. [ Indistinct ] [Billy Narrating] Now it's starting to get complicated. Straightaway, Peter Chase asked me to do a little job for him. I drive 'em to this burger bar, and they tell me to wait. -[Sirens Wailing] -[Man] Police, stop ! Armed police ! Sit. I just lost [Door Unlocks, Opens] How'd it go ? A total disaster. Couriers got arrested. We lost thegear. Pete lost his money. Couldn't have gone much better really, could it ? [ Both Laughing ] - Oh ! Oh, God ! - Eh ? - Are you gonna see him then, babe ? - Yeah. Oh ! Now he owes you, you know that. Now's the time to call in the debt. Yeah, I know. What was her name again, that blond one at the club ? - Suzy. - Yeah. She had a beautiful little arse. You get her number for me, yeah ? Either her arse or your arse, Billy Whizz. [ Laughs ] Welcome back, Jason. You didn't tell me you were rich, John. [ Laughs ] I'm not rich. Everybody's suddenly rich while I'm inside. It's a nice place, John. Could easily get a swimming pool in this garden. Yeah. Nice pool with a cover on it. Gym upstairs. I could handle that. I leave the garden to Henry. That's his domain. - Cheers. - Cheers, John. I'm very grateful for what you did for me inside, Jason. [ Chuckles ] That's all right. I was wondering whether I could repay the favor. Is there anything I can do for you ? Well, if you're asking, John, maybe there is. I've got some friends who need some gear brought into the country. - Gear ? - Naughty gear, John. All right, Henry ? How's it going ? Been having a lot of trouble with drainage. Clay soil round here. Water lies on the surface. Heavy rain drowns everything off. Yeah. Gutting when that happens, isn't it ? All right, come on. Come on. The truth is I work just for one person now, then only occasionally. Working outside that arrangement would be too dangerous. And, you see, I-- I simply cannot go to prison again... ever. Well, you think about it, John. See if you can't get your head around it. See, the way I see it, people with special relationships, like us; people who've got secrets, like us-- Yeah ? Well, we should stick together. Oh, yes, yes, I agree with you, Jason. That's why I-I'd be, uh, I'd be happy to help you out fi nancially, - until you get on your feet. - Mm. No, no. I don't want your money. I'm looking to the future now, John. I wanna go into business with you. [ Fireworks Whistling ] [Billy Narrating] Welcome home, Jason. Thanks for keeping your mouth shut. One or two of the boys have overdone the sunbed tonight, but we're all here. And we're wondering what's next. -[Man] Come on. - [ Chattering ] [ All Saying Hello ] [Fireworks Continue Whistling, Exploding] Look at this ! Look, look at this ! Hello, leader. How are you doing ? Oi ! Billy Whizz, drinks. Tell Tommy to get the scotch. The good stuff, the malt, all right ? Oi, you little sods. Hey, come on, this is not a toy. Off you get ! Hey, Beverley. Beverley, would you come and look after these sods ? Jason Locke ! Out from under lock and key at last. Here he is ! Yea ! [Woman] That's the color of the moon Secretin the rainbow [Billy Narrating] Him, with Jason-- that's his old mate, Kiri Christos, the banker. Well, geezers couldn't very well go to the NatWest, could they ? So, they went to him. [Continues, Indistinct] [ Chattering ] You are looking just as beautiful as ever. - Oh ! - Beautiful ! Oh, and fiery ! Oh, yes, it's that Peter Chase spouting off. Oh, my God, Kiri ! Can you believe it ? We're in our thirties. I feel so ancient. If I looked as good as you, it wouldn't bother me much. o you know how upsetting it is to have hair coming out your nose and ears ? That's what they should have told us in biology, not how to cut up-- What were they, locusts ? [ Laughs ] You always did make me laugh. [Continues, Indistinct] Jason says he wants to go into business. Yeah, well, isn't it about time he did ? - Haven't they made enough money off his back ? - So, he needs a banker. - But he's got a problem. - What's that ? - He's got no security. - Okay. How's he get that ? Well, he needs to put up something against the loan. Something valuable. Something I want. I didn't know Jason had anything you wanted. Well, you haven't been paying much attention all these years, have you ? Kiri, um, would you just excuse me a minute ? It was just getting interesting. [Continues, Indistinct] - All right ? - Who's that ? don't know. I just said hello to her tonight. - Are you enjoying yourself? - I said, "Who is she ?" don't know.Just some little bird Billy's knocking off. Anyway, it went well with Kiri. don't shame me, Jason. - Beverley, all right ? - Mm. - So, what you been up to then, Lisa ? - Oh, you know, getting beasted by Jason. When they've been inside for so long, they want to do it up the arse. If that's what your mate's been doing to you for five years, it's bound to have an efect. - Anyway, what about you girls ? - Oh, yeah. I didn't tell you what Pete bought me for Christmas, did I ? A horse. I've called him Toby. - Oh, he's mad, isn't he ? - Put him down then. And the horse. I'm trying to be nice to you, Lisa. Oh, you've got a short memory, babe. Bit too quick to forget who's been helping you while Jason's been inside ? Two hundred and fifty quid a week ? Helping us out ? do me a favor. Well, I didn't expect for one minute that you'd be grateful. Okay, Beverley. I'm so fucking grateful. Will that do ? Oo-er. You just make sure you enjoy this party tonight, darling, 'cause it's the last thing you're gonna get from us. Make sure you keep your legs pressed tight together when you ride Toby, make you all tingly. You do remember that feeling, don't you ? - Who's a naughty boy then ? - What ? That little blond bit. That's why you didn't bring your girlfriend. Who, her ? No, she's not with me. She's just-- Well, she's with anyone, if you know what I mean. Where is she ? [Heavy Breathing, Groaning] [Heavy Breathing, Groaning Continues] Oh, shit. You bastard. You do this here in front of everyone. You bastard ! Bastard ! - Fucking bastard ! - Shut up ! - You bastard ! Get off me ! - Shut your fucking mouth ! - [ Screams ] -Just fucking cool off ! Go on, fucking cool off ! You think you own me ? " do this, Jason. do that, Jason.'' Well, fuck you ! [Sobbing] I waited for you for five years ! Yeah, you waited for me, did you ? You think I'm fucking stupid ? - I didn't do anything ! - I don't believe you. [ Screams ] I didn't do anything ! Fuck off ! You're like a fucking leech ! [ Sobbing ] What the fuck do I need you for, eh ? I mean, why do you think I go with other women, eh ? Because you're a fucking nuisance ! - [ Screams ] - You're not even a good fuck ! I don't even fancy you anymore. That's a lie ! That's a lie ! Get her out of here. [Lisa Sobbing] [Lisa Sobbing] You all right ? That bastard's done this to me before. He got the last one pregnant. Another little blond bit. He had a little boy with her. You see... I can't have kids, Billy. [ Sniffles ] That was a fucking laugh, weren't it, for everyone else ? Everyone looking at me, knowing. The joke is-- I actually waited for him. [ Sighs ] I used to sit behind him in class. did you know that ? I thought he was God's gift. All the girls fancied him. But I got him. I thought I was such a lucky girl. Mm. Lisa. Lisa ! Wait, hold on. I don't think we should, all right. It's not that I don't want to. Thanks, Billy. Thanks for not taking advantage of me when I'm like this. Most of the other guys would have jumped on me. You're different. Thanks. [ Softly] Um, it's just, um, you know-- Billy. Billy, I'm taking the piss out of you. Look at you. You're no good to me. You're just a fucking pussy like all the rest of them. Bring my bag. Tell Billy the groceries are ready. I want this over as quickly as possible. - All right ? It's all in there. - Yeah. [ Laughs ] You fucking beauty. There you go. Thanks. See you later. Have fun. Spotty dogs. Seen them, Billy ? No. Here you are. Try one. Cheers, Wayne. [Billy Narrating] Now, Jason is very anti-drugs. Thatis anti anyone else's drugs. It's an odanda wink and in goes his man with a bag of Spotty Dogs. Thank you very much. See you later. - Oi ! - All right ? - How's it going ? - Sweet. This is a piece of piss. What are we looking at when we knock this lot out ? I don't know, Quarter of a million ? Fuckin' hell ! You've done well, Jase. You've come through for us, Just when we needed it. You know what this is ? It's a contract... to provide security for Blondz nightclub in Southend. Sorted it out with the owners. Got fed up with the other lot. Too much aggravation. People flying through windows. Perry Elley's out, we're in. Partners ? Partners.

[Muffled Screaming] [Muffled Screaming ] All right, John ? do you think I'd try and stiff you ? Do you think I'm mad? It was a bad batch. There was nothing I could do. You know, when I was inside, I heard this screaming one day. So I went to have a look, and I found yke here... bent over the table with his trousers round his ankles, four big, hairy paddies holding him down, about to bugger him. Old Henry, he's off playing bingo. Ain't that right, Henry ? Please. Please, Jason, don't do-- don't do anything stupid. That was the first time I met you, wasn't it ? Well, in a little while, you're gonna be wishing I'd walk straight past you that day... - and just let 'em get on with it. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jason. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [Whimpering ] You've got 48 hours to get me my money back... and the profit we lost. You fucking worm ! -[Lovell] What you gonna do about Lisa ? - [ Sniffs ] Fuck all ! - Hey, Billy Whizz, have you seen her? - No. Where'd you take her then ? You drove her away. I brought her back here and I went home. Leave her. She'll come back with her tail between her legs, -likes he always does. - What about that other business ? - You sort that out as well ? - Yeah. - Where did you dump it ? - I sorted it out. That's all you need to know. - You ought to watch your fucking mouth. - Leave him. - No ! Fucking kid ! - Leave him, leave him. Come on. Billy, which one do you want, eh ? Huh ? You can have first choice, as long as it's not the blond one. Um, I'll pass, thanks. Is it all right if I see you lot later ? Which one, Billy ? Where you going ? I'm going home. I'm tired. - You're not leaving. - Look, I've had enough. I want out. You don't want out on me, you skinny, little prick ! Now I said, which one do you want, eh ? - This one ? Eh ? - [ Screams ] do you want this one, or do you want this one, eh ? No ? Well, why not do 'em both, eh ? Now get in there and don't fucking come out till you've done 'em ! You know, I went to that place-- what's it called ? Lakeside last week. I spent the whole afternoon in a tea shop just watching. Something about the women in that part of the world that I find absolutely irresistible. Thought you were only interested in Henry. No, they're fiercely pretty, yet hard as nails, and it's a perfect combination. What I wouldn't give to have my youth again in Essex. All I remember of my youth is getting freezing cold under Southend Pier... with me knickers around me ankles. [ Chuckles ] Well, I'll take you under that pier again. You can haveyour knickers around your ankles again. You know, I'm gonna have to go back to him, don't you ? You know, I'm just about to do something... really big. After that, I'll be able to pay them of, and I'll still be a very rich man. We could go somewhere where he'd never find us. It's just a little investment. Spreading out the old tentacles, youknow. Had bit of spare cash laying about, and I fucking hate waiting for cabs, so why not ? [ Chuckles ] - Perry. - Oh, thanks, darling. -did you, uh, watch 'em make it ? - Yeah. Smoked salmon ? Yeah, great. You know they gob in these things in those places. So, what happened to your face ? Oh, I, I, uh-- I had some, um-- - I had some problems the other night. - Uh-huh. - So speak to me. - Well, I just wanted to talk about the drop, make sure everything's going to plan. Oh, yeah. Everything's still going to plan, John, except for one small detail. You're no longer part of that plan. What's the matter? You think I don't know about things ? Perry, I need this job. We've been friends for a long time. Are you taking me for a cunt, John ? Perry, that was a one-off. John, are you taking me for a cunt ? - It's a very simple little question. - No. No, of course not. Well, listen. Take my advice and fuck off right now... before I lose my temper, all right ? Perry, you-- you can't just cut me out. Can't ? Can't ? You just watch me. The minute that you do business with those fuckers, you become dirty. I can no longer trust you. So now... you're gone. Fuck off. Nothing personal, John. I haven't got your money. But I've got something better, a new proposition. Something that will be worth much more. -It'll make you a million each. Minimum. -Come on, Jason. Let's listen to what he's gotta say. Perry Elley is flying in a consignment of coke. - A big one. - Mm-hmm. I know when and where the drop is going to be made. I can put you in the right place at the right time to hit the courier. We divide the consignment into four, and that's a million a piece. And we get to whack Perry Elley. It's perfect. There are two stipulations. Stipulations ? Like what ? First, this wipes the slate clean. And ? And we never cross each other's paths again. Why not ? Who wants to see you again anyway ? [Laughing ] [Billy] So, now they're all in it together. A nice little jolly boys outing. [ Peter] Well, we're gonna need a four-wheel drive, ain't we ? The plane will come in over the top of those trees, and the pilot will probably set it down in that stretch of field over there. They have runway lights that flick on at the last moment. Oh, yeah ? Well, what if it's raining then, like tonight ? Shouldn't make any difference. Well, we can hole up over there for a couple of hours before they make the drop. Yeah. Get here nice and early. And then boom, boom, fucking boom. Take out the reception committee... and the courier. We'll need automatic weapons and night sights. Yeah, we can do this. - When then ? - Oh. Soon. Look, I've, uh-- I got the keys to the, uh, to the gate here. You won't want me around, will you ? It's not my scene, really. What's the matter, ykey ? Squeamish ? This is a field. This is where worms belong. I wouldn't let you miss this, not for the world. That goes for you too, Billy Whizz. [Jason Humming] [Jason And Crew] Who wants to be a millionaire We do [Techno] Who wants to be a millionaire We do There's no waywe're gonna chuck it all away, not what we've got. - Good. - Yeah. I mean, we're really great together. [Jason] Get us another bottle, will you, babe ? [All Laughing ] Come here. You know, we've discovered the secret... to a happy relationship, haven't we, Lisa ? I do what I want, and she does what I tell her. That's what works for us. - And a back hander every now and then. -[Laughing Continues] Only it's important to have a secret when they get to this age, you know. Once they get past 30, they start getting saggy, you know ? imples in their arses, eh, Lisa ? And their tits start to hang down. And they still wear frilly underwear, but it don'tlook very nice, no. But I tell you, they're still handy for carrying and fetching. Now go on, get some glasses. Billy Whizz, give her a hand. [Laughing Continues] He's a fucking arsehole. Forget it. I can handle him. When this all comes off, perhaps you should bury the hatchet with yke. - He could be useful. - Oh, I'll bury it in his fucking head. Look, I've made up me mind. We hit yke and have his share between us. About the other night, I'm really sorry for what I said. I was hurt, and when I'm hurt, I lash out. You just happened to be in the way. - Are we still friends ? - Yeah, no problem. What about Billy Whizz ? Can we trust him ? No. Better do him and all. [Tapping On Window] [Keys Drop] Evening, Billy. How many of them will there be ? About three or four, I should think. They'll all have to be taken out. [ Sighs ] Fucking hell. [Car Approaches] Wish me luck. All right, Billy Whizz ! You wanker ! Heckler & Koch MP5. Fires a standard Thirty rounds a magazine, eight hundred rounds a minute on full auto. Fucking quality. We couldn't get the night sights, so we're just gonna have to get in close, eh ? Shall we go ? What's up, Mr. Worm ? [ Whistling ] Who wants to be a millionaire We do, we do - Who do ? - We do ! Yeah ! I'll get the gate, shall I ? Boom. [Cell Phone Ringing] Hello. Where are you ? You sound funny. Yeah ? Yeah, get a couple of bottles. [Billy Screaming] [ Continues Screaming ] Shut up, Billy ! There's no need for this, John. You can keep it all. Oh, Jason, you foolish, greedy boy. There are no drugs. There is noplane. You want to mess with me ? You're not in the same league. I thought we were mates. I looked after you in prison. I'm a man of honor, Jason. I always pay my debts. Please. This is silly. Billy, you said you wanted to know how far this was going to take you. - No ! don't ! - Hold it, John. - Leave him, Henry. - He's a witness. I'm not having this little bastard hanging over me. No, no, no. Leave him alone, Henry. That's enough for tonight. Who wants to be a millionaire They don't [ Chuckling ] [ Laughing ] Hello, Billy. Yeah, come in. You can listen to this. Obviously, if you don't mind, Lisa. I had no idea where Jason was going that night. Yeah, but-- That's weird though, isn't it ? It's not very romantic, is it ? He'd been out of prison for, what, two weeks ? I mean, he's hanging out with all sorts of strange people, leaving you here home alone. Don't know who he's with, where he is. My husband fucked around. Is that what you want to hear ? - You ever heard of Suzy Welch ? - Who ? Suzy Welch. Young girl. Very pretty. on't know whether your husband associated with her in the last couple of weeks, doyou ? It's possible. If she had a cute arse, it's certainly possible. Hmm. She disappeared. And you think Jason's death may have something to do with it ? Some one killed him because of her? Thanks. Makes me feel really great. Oh. I've upset you now, ain't I ? I didn't mean to do that. All right. I'll leave you here. Leave you two in your grief. Billy. Used to drive for Jason, didn't you ? Yeah, now and again, but not that night, obviously. [ Chuckles ] Obviously. I'll be in touch. You didn't think I'd go through with it, did you ? Admit it. No. I did it for you. Where have you been ? I've been waiting for two hours. I've had the police around. - I'm sorry. - It worries me how much they know. Oh, what can they know ? They know nothing. The only people who can tell them anything... can't speak. Billy can. They know he drove for Jason. No. Billy's all right. on't worry about Billy. You sure you can trust him ? No. He's too scared to say anything. So, how are you ? Is the burden of knowledge weighing you down ? No. I'm fine. It's like I told you, Billy. It's moments like this that will make you... or break you. Have the police been to see you ? Yeah. There was a smart arse Old Bill around Lisa's. - What did he ask you ? - Nothing. - He just give me his card and said he'd get in touch. - Good. We must expect this, Billy. It's perfectly normal. They'll be questioning all his associates. I'm sure they'll be talking to me at some point. The situation is very simple, Billy. The only people who know what happened... are you, me and Henry. The other people who knew... are, of course, dead. Mr. ., you know, I-- I, like-- I wouldn't say a word about this to anyone. Look. All this work for a drainage trench. Can you believe how obsessed Henry gets about this garden ? I'm bringing a shipment in this week. I wanted to make sure I could rely on you. Y-Yeah, ofcourse. Nothing's changed. Now tell me, how's Lisa ? I haven't seen her for awhile. Uh, she's a bit upset. I want you to, uh, look after her a bit. drive her around, make sure she doesn't come to any harm. I'm worried about her. I'm taking over the business, Beverley. - I want the books. - Go fuck yourself. Lend me one of your vibrators, and I will. Which one's been your favorite since Peter got splattered ? You bitch ! Fucking try that again, I'll fucking do you ! What gives you the right to think you can just come in here and take over ? 'Cause who's gonna stop me ? You, Beverley ? don't make me laugh. Look at you. This place. This stuff. You got your drinks trolley, chandelier, piano. Can you even play the piano, Beverley ? And how'd you get all of this, eh ? Of of Jason's back. - That's how. - You're the one's who's got everything on your back. don't annoy me, Beverley. The terms are getting worse all the time. Now, you can keep this house and the cars. I'm taking over the doors. If you have a problem with that, you can have a chat with Kiri Christos about the money you owe him. What am I supposed to live on ? Yeah. I've been thinking about that. Remember? That's what Peter was paying me when Jason was inside. That's when he wasn't trying to get inside my knickers. Fair's fair, eh, Beverley ? Where now ? I keep turning it over and over in my mind. I must have been speaking to him just before he died. Yeah ? - Where were you, Billy ? - Me ? I was at home watching the telly. Well, I knew they were planning something. Why didn't they want you to drive 'em ? don't know. They were all very secretive about it. - You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Billy ? - I weren't there. So, who do you think done it ? don't know. Perry Elley ? What about John yke ? do you think he could have had anything to do with it ? No. Mr. . ? No. Why, do you ? I don't know. There's just something about him that's not quite right. Lisa, there's-- - there's something I gotta tell ya. - What ? It's been playing on my mind. What has ? It's about Jason. And just, like-- The way he died. [ Sighs ] How did he die, Billy ? I just-- I just keep thinking it-- it's gonna happen to you and me. [Cell Phone: '"Jingle Bells ''] - Hello ? -[Dyke] Billy, the groceries are ready. Oh, right, yeah. Um, I'll be there as soon as I can. - Where are you ? - I'm at home. I'm on me way. Where's Lisa ? I, uh, I-I-- She went shopping. I dropped her off. Okay. Be as quick as you can. [ Beeps ] [ Engine Hissing ] Yeah, you fuck. Fuck. I had high hopes of you, Billy. Thought you had brains. [ Chuckles ] Not like those other animals. I was prepared to help you. [ Chuckles ] I knew you'd make mistakes. Then you went too far. She belongs to me, Billy. I don't want you to touch her! [ dialing Cell Phone ] You wanted to know where this would take you. Billy, it ends here ! [Cell Phone: '"Jingle Bells ''] [ Stops ] [Engine Starts] You fucker ! Lisa, it's me. They just fucking shot me. I can't believe this shit. - Are you okay ? - No, I fuckin' ain't okay ! They just tried to kill me ! Why didn't you tell me about you and yke ? - What the fuck's going on ? - Listen, it's a little difficult. Little difficult ? Well, I'll tell you something, Lisa. They fucking killed Jason. Okay. Can you drive ? did you hear what I just said ? They killed Jason, Lisa. - I fucking saw them. - I can't talk right now. - Can you drive ? - Yeah, I can drive. - Okay. I'll meet you at number six. - Number six ? The motel ? - Yeah, that's right. - You will be there ? Yeah, I'll be there. don't fuck me up, Lisa. I need you. I'm really sorry, Perry. Something's come up. It's girl stuff. Can we continue this later ? Oh, that's a shame. do you know they make these with fresh fruit ? Tell you what. You can have my cherry. [ Panting ] We can't stay here 'cause he'll come here. He'll find us. It's all right, it's all right. We're safe for the time being. - Let's get you out of this. - It fucking hurts. It's okay. We've gotta get you cleaned up, get you in the bath. Why didn't you tell me about you and him ? There's nothing to tell. He's got some sort of obsession with me, that's all. Just got out of hand. Well, he's just tried to fucking kill me. He nearly did and all. - He'll kill you too. - Let's deal with one problem at a time, eh ? What have you done here ? Well, we got them " E's" next door. We can sell them two bags of pills and just get out of here. What do you think ? I'm gonna need some antiseptic, some tweezers and a dressing. What's the time ? Look, I'm gonna find a late night chemist. I'll take your clothes to the laundry too. We can't have you checking out covered in mud. Come on, drink up. What do you think ? I think it's a really good idea, Billy. Just you and me together. Well, don't be too long. I won't. -[Door Closes] - [ Coughs ] [Cell Phone Ringing] Where are you ? don't know. You sound funny. [Lisa] Good-bye, Jason. [Cell Phone Ringing] [Ringing Continues] - Hello. - Good-bye, Billy. John, you don't have to do this ! I didn't know nothing about you and her ! I swear to God ! I wouldn't have happened if I had. John, John, here's the gear. Look ! I'm not gonna keep it. You have it. I'll go away, John, and I'll never come back ! You'll never see me again ! John, I won't say a fucking word ! I'll disappear ! [Detective On Megaphone] We are the police! We are armed! Come out of the cabin with your arms up in the air ! Come out of the cabin. Walk forward. Walk forward! Get down on your knees. Face down. Face down ! Now spread your legs. [Billy Laughing] [Billy Narrating] It was... very funny. It was hilarious. I mean, Mr. D. 's gonna kill Lisa, and I've become a liability. And now she's rubbing noses with Perry Elley. -She needs both of us out ofher life. - Hello, Billy Whizz. So, the Old Bill gets ananonymous tip, and they catch this fella red-handed... in a Southend motel room with 50 grand's worth of pills. This fella's looking at ten years inside, easy, unless he can make a trade. Turns outhe's only the witness to a shocking triple murder. Essex boys ? She done the lot of us.
