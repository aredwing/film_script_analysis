Your cave is fantastic! What brings you here? - Foryou. We are TV media people, we are curious to know you. What is your religion madam? Ours is not a religion. Not adhered to any particular religion. Ours is a community, that's all. Which God do you pray? We used to pray Lord Ganesha, Lord Venkateshwara & Goddess Alamelumanga. Mother. The cave is resounding with your voice. Sorry mother. We believe in God. Our God has no form, no name. We meditate. Meditation doesn't need any religion. What else do you want to know? -Where do you live? ln an Ashram near by... - l'll meet you there. You mustn't come there also. Don't stop me madam. l love Sanyasis. There's a Ashram for Sanyasis, join them. No madam, you've mistaken me... - Look son, l've been watching you, your concentration is wandering. -Yes. You say travels, TV program but concentrating on something else. Look at me not there, son. We want to meditate. You carry on. l don't have any objection. Shivani, show him to the door. - Come...come... Let's meet again. - Let's go out, you'll get fresh air. You can go without staring her. How does he look like? Nothing really awesome. Just average. l didn't ask if he's handsome. ls he tall? No, he's very short compared to our boss. Average height. ls he very huge? - He's not fat, just average. But his punches are not average, he's in coma. Coma is not average. We can't say anything till next 24 hours. lf you come with such news again, l don't know what l'll do with you. You got me? Hey Policeman! Don't stare at us. Don't stare at me. Catch the dog who beat my son. - Bring him. Go...go man. l can understand Tamil very well, l must learn Tamil before he gets discharged. We have many relations in this world, mother & father, brother & sister, friends, many like this. The weakest relationship is husband & wife. lt is weakest, that's why we have a divorce. But it depends on the man, so we have to keep it safe. Live here...die here... What are you doing? -Washing. Why? - To boil it. We eat only this. Just herbs, leaves and vegetables. What about chicken and mutton? Don't mention them, l'll start crying. l used to eat only non-vegetarian food. l never ate without mutton. l've become pure vegetarian here. - So sad. Why did you become a sanyasin? l asked my husband to buy a costly silk sari for me, he refused. That's why. For such a silly matter? This is not silly matter, it's a big issue. ln my time l've never seen so much of desire in eyes. Nothing like that madam, l was watching her casually drying clothes. We suspect you're looking at sensitive places. Oh my God! What a nasty accusation. l came here to film your Ashram. Come on boys, film it fast, getting madam's permission is rare. Take good shots. What do you think this is? This is an Ashram. Why are you looking there, son? Look at me. l saw you madam, you're beautiful. Didn't l tell you men are not allowed into the Ashram? What's this gender difference? We both have souls, Supreme Lord is up above. Don't confuse me with your silly logic. You've become very clever. Sorry madam, we'll finish the job quickly & leave the place. Swami, your Rs. 1000. Second episode. This girl is good. What happened next day? - Day? The day you were kidnapped and slept that night. l slept and thought l'll go home by morning. How could l expect a police raid? Get up - They thought l was also a kidnapper. They didn't listen to me. They arrested and took me to the police station. How long you are into this kidnapping business? What are you shouting at me? Constable, take his finger prints. Why are you refusing to give yourfinger print? Do you think yourself to be Chiranjeevi in film 'Khaidi' ? l remembered Chiranjeevi once. l got 1000 elephants strength. Police station broke down. Catch him! l ran into the forest. Without knowing l became a criminal on run. What happened afterthat sir? Remove it...get up. That's all? - Come, he'll not continue. She's coming. - Greetings Shivani. Please sit down. Mother will scold if she knows l'm meeting you. You can go, please tell about your life. Though l was born in a factionist's family, l wanted to live a fashionable life. l never expected l'll live in a single costume. l must get up early morning, practice Yoga, meditate and eat vegetarian food only. lt's been eons since l eat something spicy.- Pickle! lt's been long time... lt's mouth-watering.- Me too. lf you all don't mind l'll have a lick. Mixing pickle with hot rice and adding ghee to it, if you mix all and have it ...oh my God! We'll give you many such pickle bottles, our Bala loves your Vaishali, you must help us. Do you know to speak Bengali? - Do you know this? Vaishali is a Telugu girl. Why did you lie to us that Vaishali is a Bengali? Do you know how much l had lost for it? What have you lost? You said Bengali, my position weakened with lack of communication. How do you know my sorrow of failing to express her my love? lf she had been a Telugu girl, l would've told her my feelings, by hook or crook, l would've trapped her by now. l lied because you're like that. No need of shadow boxing any more. l'll express my heart, l like that girl, l love her, l don't know how you do it, if you all together convince and give herto me, l'll take her with me and marry her. That's the matter. Please come with me. Will she accept me? Please sit here. Do you love me? Do you like me so much? -Very much. Do you love my heart? Or do you love my body? Your body! Because l don't know your heart. Look, you're very beautiful, enchanting smile, skin tone is fantastic, that's enough for me. l don't know why you're so attracted to this body. All this is mud. After our death this flesh becomes a part of earth. Blood and urine will mix with water. Breath will mix with air. ls this mud? Your mud is very good. You don't have any attraction on this mud, right?- No. No isn't it? Okay, good. Will you please do me a small favour? - Go ahead. Small favour. - Tell me. Spend a night with me. lsn't it just mud? Don't tell about your silly philosophy. Mud...just mud...then why do you take a bath everyday? Then soaps, Yoga, meditation, vegetables, fruits, forthis silly mud. He's talking nonsense, let's go, mother. You...you...you... l love you with my heart... Come...come...come... Won't you listen to me? What's your problem? My life and death is with you... Can't you understand this? Beauty given by God... Oh what a youth! Don't let it go waste... lf l touch it, it angers them...

How nice it would've been if l had been there? lt's been long time l had seen a movie, at least l would've seen a fight. He fought those fighters foryou, that shows how much he likes you.

Small eyes...Little lips... lf you start looking your face in the mirror, you'll feel like applying lipstick, feel like applying kohl to eyes, you feel like sporting a dot, mirror leads to all sorts of problems. That's why mirror is banned in Ashram. Load it quickly. Why there are lot of apples here? -Always ask for money. Do it quickly. -Are you apple seller? What's the price of a box of apples? How much stock you need? - l'm asking you man. What's that red cap? Bloody fool! Only shouts, no business. He's over acting. Bloody...idiot. He's acting as if he's great. -Why do you hurt others with yourtalk? You talk too much of nonsense. Don't talk to anyone for a day. Just a kind of meditation. Your nonsense will reduce. What were you asking when l was talking on phone? You were abusing me, l took it easily as you are a Telugu boy, Have you run away from home? Don't you've money to back? My lorries are going, l'll give you lift. Tell me, what do you want? You were asking something just a while ago. Why are you leaving before l finish?

Fundamental of love... Directions vanish when l meet you... Time stands still in the magic created by you... My life is hitting a streak of luck with you... My heart is tasting happiness forthe first time... Come into my life like an unforgettable sweet memory... Be always with me like the smile on my lip... You were born for me... Your love said that to me... You're in my heart... My breath says it... After vigorous weapons training, l too became an active member, unexpectedly l got a promotion too. Do you what is this? This is stick. You fool, it's not a stick, but twin towers of America. We have to hijack a flight and blow it up. You've to command this operation. Holy War! Bloody idiots! Were you involved in blowing up of twin towers? My foot, l got excited with that news and was affected with dysentery. l was left out in the last minute. l lied to them that l'll plant bombs in Delhi, l went to Himalayas and became 'Gudumba' Shankar. ljoined this group. l want my wife back. - Not this girl. Please find my wife. - Okay. What was yourfirst impression about me? Next? Now...? Still l've the same impression. But l've also become a fool like you. Would you like to buy bangles? Are you feeling cold? Wait here, l'll get you a sweater. l don't know who he is, come let's go. Catch those people...catch them... We know that she's an orphan, we don't know her past, who they are or why they are here? You cheated us and left this place, where did you go? Look at me...bloody dirty face. So, you stay in Kulu Manali..? We were hunting you for the last 2 years. We came to know your whereabouts when we saw you on TV. Are you a sanyasin? Say something. Want to become a sanaysin? ls Vaishali back? Did you get her or did she come back? We got her. What do you mean by that? Whetherthey got her or not? - They got Vaishali. Do you know who Vaishali is? l don't care about that. But you are happy. That's more than enough. They didn't recognize me. But they came forthat girl. Now l must find the reason and her whereabouts. l am going to Dhoolpet. No. They will kill you. They are hunting foryou. Listen to me..please. This is the house. Go & inquire. - But don't step out of the car. Why did you come here? lf they see you, they will kill you. Who are you? You saved me from them. Don't you remember? Oh! lt's you! Do you know them? - l know Will you do me a favour? - Tell me. l'm in love with a girl. They kidnapped her. Are you talking about Vaishali? Do you know her? -Yes, l know. They tried to kill me because of Vaishali. Do you know who Vaishali is? Narayana Patwari's daughter. He means terrorto everyone. Myself, Thambidurai, Ponnuswamy, Murugesan used to work for him. Vaishali is his only daughter. Thambidurai & Ponnuswamy eyed for his wealth. Patwari, get your daughter married to Murugesan. How dare you wish my daughterto become wife of my henchman? Do you want to sleep with my daughter on my bed? l will kill you all. l will kill you first. - No. There is nothing wrong in it. Did you & your daughter came down from heaven? Father... They killed her parents in a blink of an eye. l was left helpless. Murugesan, tie the auspicious thread. Tie it infront of him. l will see what he will do. What will you do? Now it's all your wealth. l wanted to save Vaishali. Run fast... Go. l succeeded in escaping from them. But l lost Vaishali. l didn't know where she went. l searched everywhere but in vain. They believe that l helped her go underground. Vaishali is back in their clutches. You must save Vaishali at any cost. Where is the police station? You both might be in love. But rescuing herfrom Thambidurai's house is not an easy task. But you also say that she is married. Whatever happened infront of her dead parents is not a marriage. Only we know that. But they are spinning different stories. They say that Patwari was killed by someone else they are looking after his family now. We all know that he is a criminal. But there is neither a witness nor proof. That's why our hands are tied down. lf l rescue her now, a case will be lodged against me for arresting his daughter-in-law. So, the bottomline is l can't help you. Thank you sir. Your name is Bala Govind, right? Did you hit Murugesan? Shake hands l say. Beat everyone black & blue. l will help you. Thank you sir. Beat them to pulp. Eat a little. - No. lf l smash your head against the wall, it will break into pieces. Eat fast. We need your wealth not you. Better live with Murugesan. After 6 months, if you find it difficult to live with him, ..commit suicide. Else l will kill you. Got it? Tell her. Why there are so many men on guard? Are they all goons? Vaishali is here. l must see Vaishali for once. That's impossible. She is in that house. l will go now. You don't know about them. They don't know about me. Hey you! Cut the power. - No. lf you cut the power, l will go & see Vaishali. lf possible, l will come back with her. lf nothing is possible, l will beat some guy & come. Cut the power lines. Power cuts now? Light the candles. We must call the Minister and warn the electrical dept. Sure. Where is the candle? You pot boy! Who are you? Keep the pot down and light the candle. There are so many of you guys at home. But none has any common sense. So long to light a candle? The entire house is dark. l could see nothing. Where are you going? Keep the candle in her room. Don't worry. l'm there foryou. The hearts...have united... Only silence remained in my heart... As l got to you, it melted like snow... Where are you? You came just now... l will keep you safe in my eyes... l dreamt foryou... ln my dreams l saw you... Though we are separated... l'm following you as your shadow... You laid a trap in my heart... What are you? A dream or a wave? You have sunk me in it. Before l could come out of your hallucination... your memories overtake me... l preserved my love foryou... l will share my passion with you... Together... You lit fire in me with your burning kisses... Wet me with your sweat... You have cast a spell on my soul... You filled my life with love and passion... Before l could hearyour echoes of love... you overtake me with your lust... When seconds turn into eons and entangle me... l came to you seeking refuge... Together... You elate me & crush me in your love... Let's go, Vaishali. Why are you standing here? Planning to escape? Did you think you could cheat us? Go. How dare you try to escape again? You can't play yourtricks with me. Yes Bala. Switch on the power. No. They will kill you. Do as l say. Switch on the power. Come. Come l say. Thank God! The power is back. Look at her. What happened? She was planning to escape in the dark. You can never escape. Only Murugesan can keep you in track. Now switch off the power. Why is this power is tripping often? Call the Electricity Dept. lf the power goes off again, l will... Who hit me? Catch him. Find out who hit me. Who hit me? Go & search. Drink this & narrate your experiences. Once l became a sanyasi l lost everything. Now my only problem is to find my wife. Since you all are from MAA TV, this is my wife's photo. Show this photo on your TV and help me to find my wife. Shivani...? ls Shivani your wife? How do you guys know my wife? She is ourfriend. - Friend? We met her in Manali as a sanyasin when we went there for a shoot. ls my wife in Manali? -Yes.
