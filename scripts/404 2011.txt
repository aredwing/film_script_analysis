This is the management's decision. But what is the point in keeping That room Iocked? I have heard a spirit haunts the room. No one has been abIe to Iive there. You can stiII see him. Everyone says so. You can stiII see him. Let us shift him to 404. He won't Iast. WiII you Iast? - What say? Speak up. The seniors have done this. So you see the consequences of messing with the seniors. And aII this has happened because of you. Enough is enough. I am Ieaving this hosteI. I don't want to Iive in a hosteI. I am considering Iiving as a paying guest. ShaII we speak to the warden? - Warden? That is useIess. You think warden can heIp? - No one is going anywhere. I am moving out of this room. This just is impossibIe. But sir.. - Dr. Vaidya is right. It is not possibIe. Heard that? Let us go now. Just a minute, sir. Sir, we are four students staying in four rooms. Do you reaIise? A feIIow student had committed suicide in that room. Too many rumours. That room stays Iocked. But I don't beIieve in these things, sir. But we do. And we don't want these rumours to spread any more. AbsoIuteIy. In fact, the rumours wiII increase if you keep the room Iocked. It is in aII in the mind, sir. Sir, a prime institution Iike this. How can you beIieve in these things, sir? Are we cIear? - Sir, but.. Are we cIear? - Yes sir. Good. Go. I had toId you that he won't agree. Lawrence, I think you shouId aIIot him the room. CharIes, pIease. - No. The kid is right. If we aIIot him the room, the rumours wiII end on its own. CharIes, do we need another inquiry? Lawrence, trust me. This room has been Iocked for three years. You got it opened. Come in. WeII, you must have heard about this room. I don't beIieve in these things. Yes. Its just different point of views. Pandit, get this room cIeaned. - AIright. The mind is the matrix of aII matter TaIking about the master secret of aII ages. The century's biggest secret. The power of your own sub conscious mind. Very few come to know of this power. Because very few Iook for it in their sub conscious mind. Our brain, which on one hand studies rocket science. The same brain ironicaIIy can faII prey to bipoIar as weII. Coming to the point. Let me expIain it to you. What exactIy is this disorder? The definitions of this disorder may wary. So basicaIIy, it is a psychiatric disorder. Characterised by one or more episodes.. ..of eIevated moods or mania at one end. And episodes of depression at the other. Excuse me, sir. - Yes. Sir, can dysfunctionaI mitochondria can aIso be a cause? Good question. ActuaIIy, a research team from Japan has cIaimed that.. And the award goes to.. Professor Aniruddha KaushaI. I wouId now Iike to invite Dr. Erickson to come on stage. And honour professor Aniruddha KaushaI Mind Science foundation awards.. ..the PHD to Prof. Aniruddha KaushaI.

Who among you had stood up against the seniors that day in the mess? Sir. No one. No one. - What nonsense. Who had stood up? - Abhi. Abhimanyu. He was acting reaIIy smart in front of Vaidya that day.

And a continuous depressive phase for two weeks. What do you think? She has been stabIe for the past year. AII this has started recentIy. Looking at the mixed episodes and rapid cycIes.. ..I think we shouId change her medication. She needs time. I don't think we can heIp her much. She must know that one has to treat oneseIf. Maybe we can guide her. That's aII. Do this. Discontinue her anti-depressors compIeteIy. Give her mood stabiIizers. 500 mg twice a day. And give her a injectabIe. Phenergan right now. Okay. - Right away. Thanks. Hi. Where were you, today? I had something to do. More important that studies. More than you too. You are hopeIess. TeII me the truth. Truth is hopeIess. But it stiII exists. - What exists? Ragging. Ragging is a very oId and a rather disturbing tradition. An act to turn boys into men. According to me the ones who rag.. ..need mentaI check up. Some peopIe can take it but others break down compIeteIy. Like this guy. He committed suicide a few years back. - Who is he? Gaurav. I stay in his room. In fact, newspapers say that because of depression.. ..he couIdn't study and faiIed in the exams.. ..and kiIIed himseIf. ObviousIy the matter was something eIse. And the matter was crushed. You mean, due to ragging? Poor thing. What poor thing? He couIdn't study. He faiIed. What stubbornness to kiII oneseIf? What wouId one try to prove with this? Abhimanyu. Even you are stubborn. You took up that room despite everyone teIIing you not to do so. What are you trying to prove? Just that there is nothing caIIed ghost. Meera. There is a guy in coIIege. Abhimanyu. Very brave boy. Very brave. Hey.. - papa, I have to go to the bathroom. I am feeIing scared. - Oh, one minute, one minute. I wiII see, I wiII see, I wiII see. I wiII see. Come, come, come, come, come. Come dear.

What is your probIem? Do you have to be mischievous aII the time? AII the time? ActuaIIy ma'am, I want to be famous. I want peopIe to know me. They wiII know you. They wiII know you. And you? - I know you. weII actuaIIy that was the conference at Copenhagen Regarding this institute, yes, I am more.. ..of a visiting facuIty. And my wife teaches here. - Okay. That is amazing. If I may ask you, doctor, how does it feeI being you? That is a good one. As a matter of fact, I am just another common man. With some uncommon aspirations if you might say so. And the biggest sources inspiration.. ..in my Iife have been some reaIIy uncommon individuaIs. Who have had immense infIuence on my Iife.. ..and definiteIy my work. And I must add, the three most important.. ..women in my Iife have been my wife.. ..my daughter and my mother. My mother is no more but she continues.. ..to be my inspiration. I know, she wiII aIways be there with me. It seems you are very cIose to your mother. ActuaIIy I have decided to dedicate my next.. ..thesis aIso to my mother. That is great. It was such a pIeasure. Thank you so much for your time. - Thank you so much. It was such a pIeasure. Thank you. - AbsoIuteIy. Take care. - Thank you Oh Chris. What is going on these days? Sir, actuaIIy mind over matter.

Sir you?. - What is it, doctor? Going off to sIeep very earIy. Don't you have to study? There is a book for you. Chris has sent it. True stories of ghosts. Let us read it outside. Come on. Okay, teII me something. If medicaI was reaIIy science.. ..why wouId peopIe die? Have you ever heard about vibrations and residuaI energy? Spirits are nothing but energy 'Energy is indestructibIe.' Energy can neither be created nor destroyed Gauravs spirit stiII haunts the room that room is not yours.. ..but beIongs to Gaurav Gaurav is stiII around ''It is there.' Abhimanyu. Since when is aII this going on? - But sir, since a few days. Why didn't you teII me? Sir, I feIt that it is not right to compIain repeatedIy. Look, raising your voice against.. ..something wrong is not compIaining. Sir, but in coIIege, it is aImost a tradition now. Tradition? Sometimes it is essentiaI to change tradition. PIease understand. - Hi, what is up? Oh hi, hi. - Hi. This is Meera, my wife. - HeIIo ma'am. Hi. - And he is Abhimanyu. Okay. Hi. Okay. So are you free right now? Coffee, maybe?

And at night, the voItage fIuctuates Panditji, if your voItage keeps on fIuctuating. the budget of my hosteI wiII.. ..keep on going up and down too. Sir, shouId I do it or shouId I Ieave it? Now I have onIy one answer for your question. If you do it, you wiII even have a job in the coIIege. And if you Ieave it, you wiII have to Ieave the job in the coIIege. So, sir, I wiII do it. Yes. According to me, it is better to.. ..keep working rather than Ioosing the job. Good evening, sir. Good evening, good evening. Hey Abhi. Where are you going being so decked up?

This is my room. I onIy study at night. My room no is 404. This is not your room. It is mine.. - It is mine. This is my room. - Leave my room. I onIy study at night. Leave my room. Get out that is my room.. Ieave. I am Gaurav. Abhi. I Ieft my book in your room. Thanks, man. They made us drink a Iot, buddy. They made us drink a Iot. I drank a Iot today, buddy. Hey, the seniors reaIIy gave us a tough time. Don't even ask. Don't ask. 13-14 drinks. You guys drank a Iot today, right? Who does this? Hey, did you get your book? Hey, teII me. This is my room. Abhi. What happened? Abhi. Yes? Nothing. By resuming our Iast Iecture.. ..I want to share a case study of a girI. Her name is Minakshi. Age is 27. InteIIigent. BeautifuI. She was a bright student in schooI. But after that.. - This is nothing but your imagination. Lack of focus. Substance abuse.. - But.. But what? - BIasphemy. Distraction. You shouId at Ieast teII professor Aniruddha about your ragging. And the after effects. Minakshi got into addiction at a very young age. She was so caIIed wiId, cooI.. - I can handIe it ExperimentaI. GraduaIIy.. - 24x7 thinking about Gaurav That's the cause She became a seIf procIaimed rebeI. - Abhi. You Ieave that room. - Because.. - It is reaIIy not worth it. And then.. - Since the time you have shifted to that room.. ..Iook, so many probIems have come up. Even seniors are against you. One thing Ieading to the other.. TiII when wiII aII this go on? - She had to even Ieave coIIege.. At Ieast write a Ietter to the dean anonymousIy. Of course, aII this was.. - This has to stop. Can't handIe this any more.. - One cIosed room.. Yes Abhimanyu. - Yes sir. Any question. No sir. Sit down. ActuaIIy she was a briIIiant poet. She used to write good poems. But one day, that stopped too. This.. Leaving things unfinished. Leaving words unsaid. This became a sort of a pattern. And then she started Iiving in that pattern. What foIIowed was a series of reIationships that went wrong. And then a series of professions that went.. ..wrong as weII. In advanced stages, she even cIaimed.. ..that she can taIk to aIiens. She was haIIucinating. It is an interesting case study where.. ..haIIucination takes over. Robertson Davis says that the eyes onIy.. ..see what the mind is prepared to comprehend. Eyes onIy see what the mind wants them to see. That is aII for the day. Let us go. - Come on. Come on. - Come on. That was a nice Iecture. - Yes. Come on. - Come on. Disgusting.. - Sir, I don't drink. Who eIse drinks with you? Sir, Chris forced us to drink. I am teetotaIIer. - You were teetotaIIer. The stench is tiII the end of the corridor. Sir, the seniors made us drink. Every drunkard says the same thing.. ..that someone eIse made them drink. Drunkard? I.. - He is not a drunkard, sir. He becomes unconscious with the smeII of one cap fuII of aIcohoI. Hey sir, they give money to Pandit and get aIcohoI everyday.. - What? Everyday? - Sir, he is saying rubbish.. Panditji? Panditji. - Yes, yes, coming sir. Coming. Pandit. Did Babush ask you to get aIcohoI? No, he didn't, sir. - Hey, he did. Yes, he did. - He did? No, he didn't. - Pandit, he didn't? Yes, he did. - That means you suppIy aIcohoI.. ..in the hosteI. SuppIy? No, sir. When they ask for it, then I get it.. - Hey, phone. The meaning is the same, Panditji. - Excuse me, one minute. Seniors and juniors. Just Iisten to me. I wiII not toIerate that you wiII mess.. ..with the discipIine of the coIIege. Sudda - Yes sir. - Come to my office. Abhimanyu, where did you keep my book? What happened? What happened? Here, push. - Look, drinking is bad. Right Pandit. - But not drinking is worse. Come on drink. - Drink. 'Touching the sky, it went straight to the stands.. ' Hey, come on, give. - Sir. Chris. What is your probIem? Who do you think you are? CaII him. - Hey. Come here. Aren't you ashamed to rag first year students? Sir has caIIed you. - Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf? Yes sir. - What is this? Coffee. - Chris, I am taIking to you. Sir, I had given it yesterday.. - Chris. Are you doing a big favour? - I am taIking to you. If you harass my friends again, I wiII.. ..have to go to the management. I am warning you. Stay out of it. I am warning you. - Come on, Ieave. You are Done. Hey, she scoIded you and Ieft. Why was she so upset? 'The bowIing was done weII..' But she was very sweet. You are too much. Sir, I didn't want to compIain. But.. Chris and other seniors.. But onIy you can heIp me. I am reaIIy sorry, sir. Don't worry. This is my responsibiIity. Sir.. Sir. What happened? - Gaurav, sir. Sir, he.. He.. Sir, he was there.. - Who? Sir, pIease come with me. Sir, there sir. Sir, he.. Sir. Sir, he is there. Sir, sir.. - Abhimanyu. Sir, sir.. - Who? Sir.. - No one is there. Sir, Gaurav. Sir.. - Abhimanyu, no one is there.. Sir.. - No one is there. CaIm down. He, he.. - Sit down. Sit. - Gaurav.. Sit down. - Sir.. - No one is there. No one is there. Look at me. Sir.. - Quiet. Quiet. Everything has a Iimit. In the Iast three years, none of you had.. ..the courage to stay in that room. And you have a probIem because.. ..Abhimanyu is staying there today. Why? Does your ego get hurt? I had warned them earIier too. Hey, ragging shouId be heaIthy. For fun and jokes. To get to know each other better. Not to get your frustration out on someone eIse. The weak ones. No one is weak. Abhimanyu is strong. If after today, if anyone tried to bother him.. I wiII ask him to Ieave the hosteI. Understand? Bedi. This is a serious matter. - Yes sir. Abhimanyu is a rationaI guy. He agrees that due to thinking about Gaurav for.. ..24 hours, he is getting these haIIucinations. And I am sure if the ragging is stopped.. ..he wiII stop seeing Gaurav too. Stop it! Stop it! - No more ragging! Stop ragging! Stop it! Stop it! - No more ragging! Stop ragging! Stop it! Stop it! - No more ragging! Stop ragging! No more ragging! - No more ragging! No more ragging! - No more ragging! No more ragging! - No more ragging! No more ragging! - No more ragging! Stop it! Stop it! - No more ragging! Stop ragging! Sir I toId you about Chris before. He is the one responsibIe for it. - I see. Stop it! Stop it! - No more ragging! Stop ragging! No more ragging! - No more ragging! What's the use of meeting me? - Come on, Iet's pIay. - Come on. No, it's useIess to give him any warning. Look, I have toId you. Rusticate him from the hosteI. He wiII stay as a paying guest somewhere. I don't care. Papa! Papa, the game is not over yet. - Quiet. What's wrong? - what I feared. I don't want one more student to become a victim of ragging. Papa.. - Okay, you don't be more stressed. Sir, Chris has come. TeII him to wait outside. Listen, it's his finaI year. Take it easy Come on, give me the cards. - Take this too. Anurag, keep them in your room. SherIey, pIease pass it. - Wait a minute. - And keep it carefuIIy. SeriousIy it's right. - Fantastic, Young men. ExceIIent! Burn them! Erase them! What is that? Show me. ''Ragging must die.'' - Sir.. What's up? I heard you got scared? To whom wiII you compIain now? Yes? You used to roam around boasting a Iot. Sir, I request you.. - Quiet. Why are you acting as Fanne Khan? Sir, I am not pretending to be Fanne Khan.. - Shut up! So? You were going to overcome our fear, right? Have you reaIized now what they are.. - Dammit! Come on, forget it. Come on, Iet's have tea. Mustafa, come on. - Mr. Pandit, wait a minute. Hey, brother.. - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Look, brothers, there wiII be no ragging from today. Ragging is done to the coIIege students.. ..and not the schooI going chiIdren. You are right! ChiIdren! How sweet! AII of you have touched my heart. Thank you very much. ScoundreI! They are up to a drama. He makes them do a drama. What do you say? his Anirudth uncIe too wiII be pIeased He wiII distribute chocoIate to the chiIdren. Make the preparations. panditji, get the chiIdren posters pasted here. I wiII get the posters pasted. What the heII is this, Chris? Rs. 1 750? Come on, panditji, I wiII pay your biII. You wiII have to. I won't spare you today. What about the wine worth Rs. 1 7,000 which you have drank? It's fantastic, Dr. Vaidya. You have taken strict measures against ragging. Yes, but these seniors wiII never improve, doctor. Have you heard that proverb? Even if you try to straighten a dogs taiI for 100 years.. ..it wiII stiII be curved. Now they are making the juniors do a drama. Isn't the other dramas in the coIIege enough.. ..that they had to do aII this? I can see it. Come on, the seniors are happy too. I have aIready toId you, it is Chri's mischief. Now teII me, what shouId we do about Abhimanyu? He stiII insists that he shouId be aIIowed to stay there. I beIieve that we shouIdn'tjoke around with the ghosts and spirits. No one has seen God too. But he does exist. The saints and sages have seen him. Weakness of mankind, doctor. peopIe have fear of even God. It is the insecurity of the humans. What eIse? You must be joking. What shouId I do about Abhimanyu? Look, I stiII suggest that.. Sir, I am reaIIy embarrassed about yesterday. Don't be siIIy. What is there to be embarrassed? Can I use your Iaptop? - Of course. AII yours. Look, I am showing you an experiment. It is an athIete's experiment. Look at this. He is hypnotized in a Iab. And he was toId during the hypnosis.. ..that he is participating in a race. under hypnosis his muscIes started responding.. ..in a manner they wouId have respond in an actuaI race. His brain was unabIe to differentiate.. ..whether this race was in reaIity orjust his imagination. The same thing happened with you too. When the mind undergoes immense pressure.. Things get exaggerated in perception The mind cannot differentiate .. ..between reaIity and iIIusion. The criticaI mind is knocked off. Do you know an interesting fact about the human brain? It can't absorb more than 400 to 600 message units at a time. It simpIy gets taxed. Right, ma'am. Look, it is important to change that state of mind. How wiII he change his state of mind? Why do you want to stay in that room? Ma'am, actuaIIy.. - What do you want to prove? What's the use of Iiving according.. ..to the expectations of others? It's your Iife, right? - Right. You have to Iook after yourseIf first. - But, ma'am.. In fact I wouId say that you Ieave that room. Look, I too beIieve that you shouIdn't stay in that room. But if the reason is going to be ghost or something.. ..and if you are Ieaving it because of that, then I don't agree. Because in the first pIace, we started the whoIe thing.. ..with a thought that we shouId overcome your imagination. Anyway, I want to share an interesting quote. Some person wrote it. Big man. It's worth hearing. Because of any incompIete work or sudden death.. ..the souI doesn't attain saIvation. And they stay in this worId amongst us. Forever. Come on! I mean in a way, every death is a sudden death.. and ..every person who dies Ieaves some work or the other incompIete. Right? Itjust doesn't make any sense. Except one that it is important to overcome our doubts. Yes, sir. Sir! Sir, I wiII stay in the same room. I quite Iike the new batch. Yes. So do I. Quite a view, isn't it? CharIes, I think we made the wrong decision. I agree. What's the use? It has aIready happened once in this coIIege. Reputation after aII we don't have to.. Look, Meera, it was a case of acute depression. And basicaIIy ragging triggered it. I'm not dead. The room is mine.. Ieave my room Abhi. Hey, why are you creating this noise? What's wrong? You are not in the cIass? Is everything fine? Sir! Sir, do you think spirits exist? They are. They are avaiIabIe in a variety. Rum, vodka, whiskey. Sir, I mean even after death.. Look, son, there is something which peopIe beIieve. TiII I don't see it with my own eyes, I wouId just Iike to beIieve that.. ..there is no such thing. Sir, have you ever seen Gaurav? I have. I have seen him niceIy when he used to study in coIIege. Have you seen him after his death? It is you who have seen him now. Because of your ragging. You too beIieve it. And what if I have seen him without the ragging, sir? I don't want to know aII this, Abhi. Sir! Sir, did you see? What did I see? - Gaurav. Gaurav?! Where? - In the refIection. Hey! Stop this! Stop this! Stop it. I am teIIing you. Listen, give one ezethromicin. And give caIpoI for fever. And for throat.. for the throat? Dammit! What name did Dr Vaidya mention? Okay, do one thing. Mr. Pandit. Who had come to my room? Who has kept Gaurav's things here? Is it the work of the seniors? Look, Abhi, whatever the seniors Did to you was wrong. No one wanted this to happen to you. The joke turned serious.. - What if it is Gaurav.. How can it be Gaurav? Why not, Mr. Pandit? I have seen him.. Gaurav is dead. Gaurav is just your imagination. Abhi, try to understand. Gaurav is aIready dead. Abhi. He is there. Do you see him too? It is not necessary that aII what exists, Can be seen. Abhimanyu, do you understand what you are saying? Yes, sir. What can I say? I am simpIy disappointed. Sir, earIier even I was a non beIiever But sometimes we have to change our beIives, sir. What? - I am sorry, sir. But what's the harm in Accepting the truth? I mean you don't Ioose anything. There is harm. I am Ioosing a briIIiant student Iike you. Sir, beIieve me. I have spoken to him. I have seen him, sir. We were wrong. We were wrong, sir. Sir, trust me. He aIways teIIs me about himseIf. ReaIIy? What did he say? Sir, he toId me many things. Sir, he said that it was not onIy his dream to become a doctor.. ..but his entire famiIy's dream. To get admission in DMS coIIege.. ..it was a dream come true for him. He was very happy here. 'Vaidyaraj Gaurav P. Gupte.' 'Kaamsiddhi cIinic, room no. 302'. 'Behind hoteI GoId Star. Meet or write .' 'Say it aIoud.' 'Vaidyaraj Gaurav p. Gupte.' 'Yes?'

'Fantastic. - weII Done.' Sir, it was a Fresh start for his Iife. A new beginning. It is for you. See. These are those photographs which were cIicked in normaI conditions. And the photographers chaIIenge.. ..that the odd shapes and figures which you see in them.. ..are some type of ghosts or spirits. To be honest, 99% of them are not authentic It is some sort of trick photography.. ..or graphics invoIved in the photographs. What remains is one percent. If you see other photographs, in one of them.. ..the camera's strap has come in front of the Iens.. ..and its formed a shape. And it becomes a ghost. I can give you thousands of such exampIes. See, basicaIIy science can define everything. This is just a gimmick to sensationaIize things. But, sir, he is there. We wiII taIk on this topic tomorrow. But I stiII think.. I am reaIIy sorry, sir. We wiII taIk tomorrow. Thank you. Meera, what's wrong with the inverter? Coming! Meera! What is this nonsense? Meera! Wait a minute. I am coming. Meera! - Coming! TaIk softIy. I mean what's the use of the inverter.. ..which doesn't work at such a time? Sara wiII wake up. TaIk softIy. I have to compIete my thesis. And if it happens often, I wiII never be abIe to compIete my thesis. And why haven't you kept the matchbox here? Why isn't the matchbox pIaced here? It shouId be kept here. Why isn't the matchbox pIaced here? What happened at the coIIege? Nothing happened at the coIIege. The matchbox shouId be kept here. Mama! Mama! Oh Ia Ia ! What's wrong? Why are you scared? I have toId you so many times. What have I said? I feeI scared. - Of what? What are you doing? Stop yeIIing at the chiId? Why? Why do you feeI scared? Mama! - No, no. When wiII this inverter start working? I am checking. Stop shouting. What do you mean by no? Then how does he start haIIucinating it? How did he start seeing everything again? Sir, trust me. I.. Sir, I have stopped. You have stopped? It had begun because of ragging, right? You and your friends were responsibIe.. ..for the pIight of that boy. And now since you are saying the ragging has stopped.. ..then how come he is haIIucinating? How is it happening? Sir, actuaIIy.. - Hi, Chris. What's up? HeIIo! - Hi! Sir, I want to consuIt you regarding some articIes. Yes. Come and meet me in the office tomorrow. Okay? Sit down. PIease sit. So what's up? Nothing, madam, I am just studying. ReaIIy? But you had mentioned you cant focus? No, ma'am, now I can. - I see. Abhimanyu, how many horror fiIms have you seen tiII date? Why? It refIects. since Gaurav has aIready started taIking to you.. ..I am sure he must have toId you.. ..whom to avenge his death. Its not how you think. Then his dead body must be Iying somewhere.. ..and you wiII have to cremate it. Then a white Iight Iight wiII faII from heaven.. I toId you it is not so. Then how is it, Abhimanyu? He is there. Nothing eIse. I wiII come in some time. Listen. Stop this nonsense. And come for the Iecture. At Ieast pretend to be fine, Abhimanyu. Hey, I didn't teII you. I had found your bottIe of OId Spice. And the day.. no, no, it was Iying at the side of the bed. And since the day I have shifted in that room.. peopIe say you stiII stay in that room. It is too much. How is it possibIe I mean? HeIIo, sir. What are you doing here? Nothing eIse, Sir. He was your batch mate, right? What do you think about him? You are showing a Iot of improvement. - Yes. I am reaIIy gIad. I'II see you next week. Take care. Dr. Meera, I wanted to discuss about Abhimanyu with you. I wanted to consuIt you. What's the matter? He says Gaurav teIIs him everything about himseIf. 'He said that he Ioved the coIIege Iife.' 'But he feared onIy one thing. Ragging.' 'Hey!' 'Good morning, sir.' 'You had escaped that day.' 'Who wiII save you today?' 'Sir, pIease Iet me go.' 'Where wiII you go? You seem to be in a great hurry.' 'Everyone is waiting.' 'Who is waiting?' 'Sir. - Don't you want to become a doctor?' 'Come on, Iet's become a doctor.' 'Come on, Iet's go for an outing.' 'Don't you want to become a doctor? - But, sir..' 'ReIax. Come on, I wiII introduce you to some new friends today.' 'Come on! - Sir! Sir!' 'This is your new room.' 'Stay here too.' 'There are guests here waiting for you.' 'Come on! - No!' 'See you tomorrow. - Sir! Sir!' 'Sir! Sir, pIease!' 'Sir!' I wiII definiteIy beIieve that he is there. No, sir, pIease don't beIieve because I am saying so. BeIieve because it is true. We just beIieve in end resuIts. That if the teIephone rings, there are waves.. ..there is frequency. WiII the waves and frequency stop if we switch off the teIephone? They wiII definiteIy exist. BeIieve me. Just.. - What do you want to say? Sir, that Gaurav doesn't have any end. No mechanicaI end resuIt proves his existence. And I wiII prove it to you that Gaurav is just an energy. You are wasting your energy and time in worthIess things. In fact one day I wiII prove it to you.. ..how wrong your thinking is. It wiII be better for you. PIease carry on. Sorry Sir If I disturbed you. You didn't disturb me at aII. Different researchers have different theories about.. ..dreams and their.. Their interpretations. But actuaIIy dreams derive their materiaIs from reaIity. And in the process when it is.. WeII.. The theory of.. The.. 'Come on, have medicines.' - What's wrong? What happened? What's wrong? He sees him. He speaks to him. I have caIIed Abhimanyu to office. Don't worry. I wiII taIk to him. Don't worry. He is becoming Iike me. Abhimanyu has accepted that Gaurav is there. He is becoming comfortabIe with him. But he is unaware that.. ..after some time there won't be Gaurav but onIy fear! What if he becomes Iike me? What had happened with me? I too had become comfortabIe after mother's death. She stiII used to taIk to me. And what had happened when I had accepted the truth once? There was onIy fear! I used to see my mother's face everywhere.. ..and I used to scared my mother. He is becoming Iike me. Stop it! Stop it! It is not easy to become you. ReIax. ReIax. I wiII speak to the dean. Okay? Just reIax. He shouId change his room. Both of us wiII take Abhimanyu out of this probIem. Just reIax. ReIax. ReIax. Okay? Friend. He took two runs friend. - What are you doing, friend? You bowI properIy, aIright? - Make him run out, you.. Abhi! - Catch it. Catch it. Come on. No. No sir. You peopIe pIay. Come on, friend. Now Done with the Senior-junior act.. Come on, aIright? Come on, now, aIright? We wiII pIay cricket. Come, make a move. Come on. Come on. No, sir. You peopIe pIay. We are good?. What did you say? We? It wasn't correct, AII this wasn't correct. We didn't know, What didn't we know? You didn't know what you were doing? I didn't know? Yes, Chris. We crossed our Iimits. A IittIe bit of ragging is.. - What IittIe bit, friend? Had we come to do aII this, here? A IittIe bit. Have you seen his condition? Yes, His condition is bad. What can we do? - What can we do? Have we Ieft him in a condition that we can do anything with him? He has Iost it. Take your medicine. Take your medicine.' 'You have been unweII.. Take your medicine AII this is an iIIusion. Sir, he is there. In fact he is stiII sitting aIong with us. After aII we are roommates. Right, Gaurav? Sir, he shared more about himseIf. Which I need to teII you. Sir, he toId me that after that night.. ..he started remaining Iocked up in his room. Away from peopIe. But stiII the ragging continued. GraduaIIy he started feeIing LoneIy and weak. 'AIright.' Grandma come over? WiII come on Saturday to visit her. ' Ok mother. But, sir. Gaurav accepts that with one.. ..wrong step he finished everything. KiIIing himseIf was his biggest mistake. Abhimanyu. I am, actuaIIy, very worried about you. I think you need heIp. honestIy, you are heading towards.. ..a very serious medicaI condition. Then, sir. What wiII you caII Gaurav's mother's condition? She, even today, thinks that her son is aIive. Look. Even that is a type of mentaI iIIness. How do you know about Gaurav's mother? Sir, because I had gone to meet her. Even today she beIieves that her son is stiII studying in coIIege. Look, she gave me these books so that I can give them to Gaurav. Can I keep this? - Sure, sir. Abhimanyu.. I wiII see to it that you recover compIeteIy. I promise. May I come in, madam? Yes. Come Chris. Coffee? No thanks, madam. PIease teII me if you have any work? No. I had caIIed you to have coffee. You can go if you don't want to have it. Did you want to say something? AIright, madam. Bye. Chris. Chris. Come. Come, sit. Thanks. Ragging has spoiIt you.. No ma'am, don't induIge anymore. And since when did you start writing articIes? And getting them checked? You are a topper for the Iast four years. Since when did you start needing aII these things? Anyway, Ieave it. I have a patient. Meenakshi. You must have seen her, She is an unusuaI patient. I want to give her treatment in a sIightIy uncommon way. I want to give her shock therapy. I don't want anyone to find out. Can you heIp me? Chris. PIease, because I am saying so. But, madam.. - And on Aniruddha saying so? Yes. No. No. Yes. Yes. You do everything right now. Yes, I am just reac.. I am reaching just now. I am coming. It is Abhimanyu's report. Bi-poIar.. Traits were there. Because of Chris's ragging. It is fuII bIown. What do you think? What shouId we do with Chris? I asked you something. Why? You were the one had suggested. It is Chris's finaI year. Take it easy Why Aniruddha? For one thesis? You were his favourite professor. You used Abhimanyu Iike a guinea pig. Why? There is something caIIed SeIf cure That's what I did.. Abhimanyu. - Sir, you? Come. Do you know? For you I have done such a thing, today.. ..which was seemed impossibIe for years. Chris. You and Aniruddha have, ..given student-teacher reIationship a bad name. Sir, it was just an experiment. 'I chose a subject.' ' seIected him. Kept him in that room.' 'Kept him in the room got him ragged.' He wants to eradicate fear and superstition.. ..with a scientific approach. He simpIy wanted to ridicuIe the paranormaI.. 'Because of repetitive information and association.' 'He started haIIucinating.' I never imagined sir, that Abhimanyu's.. ..condition wiII deteriorate ? I made a mistake. I was just heIping in the thesis. He stiII was imagining, even when the information was stopped' 'But I have soIved it.' I am ready to face the consequences. I got infIuenced. I am very sorry. 'It is aII in the mind..' '..and after aII thoughts become right? Sir, have you seen Aniruddha anywhere? Have you seen him anywhere? Dr. Meera. - Yes, sir. ActuaIIy he is saying.. - Sir, absoIuteIy. - that.. - Sir, he is speaking correctIy. Aniruddha is in a manic phase. - What? Nobody is safe with him. He is dangerous. He can do anything. Sit. Let us start from the beginning. - Sir. Why did you choose to stay in that room.. ..knowing that it was so-caIIed haunted? Sir, because I feIt that Gaurav was a rumour. FeIt? Now what do you feeI? That he reaIIy is present there. Why is that? Because sir, I have Spoken to him. I have seen him. You had mentioned. Anyway, when did this start? Sir if I remember correctIy, the day Gaurav.. Gaurav had knocked at my door. But you had mentioned maybe they were seniors. No. No. Sir, that was Gaurav,. - ReaIIy? Why wouId he do that? Sir, because this room is his. I stay in his room, sir. Do you beIieve this? - The entire coIIege beIieves this, sir. Because the entire coIIege beIieves so.. ..is that the reason you beIieve that The room isn't yours but Gaurav's? Not exactIy, but.. - anyway If I am not mistaken your ragging Too was reIated to Gaurav? Yes, sir. The seniors had asked me.. ..to coIIect aII information about him. Then did you coIIect the information? Sir, I had no other option. What did you find out? Sir, everything about him. From his date of birth, I know everything about him, sir. Why did you go to meet his parents? Sir, to find out whether they too feIt his presence? CouId they aIso see him? So, what did you find out? His mother is even today not ready.. ..to beIieve that he is dead. Abhimanyu, whatever you said.. ..about Gaurav, untiI now, is absoIuteIy correct. But this beIief of yours that Gaurav taIks to you? Yes, sir. When we are aIone. I want to show you something. I am sorry I had to keep you under observation. I had to keep you under observation. Butjust see. Abhimanyu, a sensibIe boy. How stupidIy he is behaving. He is taIking to himseIf, standing aIone in the corridor. Sir, but.. - What but? And.. What is this? Sir, it is a diary. - where did I get it from? Sir, from my room. how did you get it? Sir, Gaurav's mother had given it to me . So that I couId give it to him. Read. Read it. Sir, it is Gaurav's personaI diary. And.. what does it read? Read it. I wiII teII you. Gaurav's personaI Iife is written in it. His coIIege Iife. His hosteI Iife. His depression. His ragging. Everything is written in it. Is it written or not? Sir.. - Is it written or not? Read. Read. Becoming a doctor wasn't just mine.. ..but my entire famiIy's dream. - ExactIy. You had toId me exactIy the same thing. That Gaurav had toId it to you. Isn't it written in this or not? Isn't it or not? Yes, sir. It is written. It is written, isn't it? Good. Gaurav is an image which has been.. ..formed in you mind after thinking.. ..about him 24x7. And after that, whatever you are Iistening.. ..around is affecting you. Like this room is his, not yours. But, sir.. - It is or isn't? Gaurav teIIs you exactIy what is written in this. That is what you teII me. And what do you want to hear? What do you want to see? Do you want to end up in a mentaI asyIum? That peopIe caII you Iunatic? And.. And what is this? These are your test reports. Bi-poIar disorder. Suspected bi-poIar disorder. You are simpIy haIIucinating. Yes, maybe you are correct, sir. Gaurav.. Gaurav was nothing. Maybe just my iIIusion. Maybe I am right? You are right, sir. And you are wrong. Yes, sir. I am wrong. GentIemen, I rest my case. 'The room which you have chosen..' '..was cIosed for the Iast three years. OnIy because of fear.' 'And you have proven them wrong.' - 'Thank you, sir.' 'He is ragged.' ' Don't worry. You are my responsibiIity.' 24x7 we are being monitored 'One day I wiII prove to you..' '..how wrong your beIieves are.' 'The iIIusion must end.' 'I wiII see to it that you become compIeteIy aIright.' 'We are mereIy puppets.' 'BasicaIIy it is a psychiatric disorder.' 'Characterised by the onset of one or more..' '..episodes of eIevated moods or mania at one end ..' 'And episodes of depression at the other..' As simpIe Abhimanyu. Look, whatever I did was very necessary. Notjust for you but for the peopIe. When you do something for the benefit of the worId.. ..then in the scheme of things, some individuaIs suffer. CoIIateraI damage. Why did you make use of Gaurav? And Abhimanyu? Look, you aren't abIe to understand what I am saying. Sir, I can stiII prove you wrong Look Abhimanyu, you are missing the point. What we have done. It is going to create history. We were together into this experiment. Open this, sir. As you had said, sir Unfinished business incompIete work. Or due to sudden death The souI does not attain saIvation. And it remains here forever, It isn't there. It isn't there. I had toId you, isn't it? There isn't anything Iike this. What one can see.. ..is aII wrong. It is wrong. It is aII wrong. It is aII wrong. I am taIking, isn't it? It's aII.. IIIusion. IIIusion. And it is nothing eIse. I know.. I'm teIIing you. It's a simpIe case of bi-poIar disorder. I'm teIIing you. It is nothing eIse. It's aII wrong. We can see it. But it isn't necessary that it exists. So. So. You aren't there. You couId have said that.
