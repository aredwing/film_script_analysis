You have become a very big boy today. There is no one else more dangerous than you. But you have to become even more dangerous, okay? You should break all the gifts I got you in a week. Only then will you get new ones. That's enough, turn it here. Happy birthday Dear. Has it already been 6 years Bittu? From the time you were born until now, I don't know how time has gone. Before you were born, I don't remember anything at all. You're the best boy in the whole world. And thank you, thank you for selecting me as your mother. You have to grow even bigger, study well, help everyone... ...make everyone say Bittu is a good boy and do us proud, okay? I love you. Come, let's go! Ladies first. Bittu. Bittu. Get up. Bittu wake up. Bittu. Bittu, get up. Bittu, get up sweetie. Get up, get up, get up, get up. Get up, get up. Happy birthday dear. - Happy birthday sweetie. Happy birthday Bittu. Thank you mummy. Where are my gifts daddy? Hugs and kisses for mom, but dad has to get the gifts? Not fair Bittu, not fair at all. Happy birthday dear. - Thank you daddy. Where are my gifts? They are in the hall, go and see. Surprise! Bittu, how is the cycle? Its good, right? Yes daddy, thank you. That's enough, give it to me. - Come on Bittu, Bittu. Light the candle. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Bittu. Bittu, Bittu. Make a wish, make a wish. Mom and dad should never fight both of them should always be happy. Happy birthday to you. Come Bittu, cut it. You made a wish, right? You made a wish, right? - Yes daddy. Cut a big piece. Why are you doing that? - What happened Krishna? What are you doing? I don't like a knife on Bittu's name. Shall we cut the cake? Cut it Bittu. Bittu, Bittu, Bittu. Here, have cake. Bittu look here. Look here. Happy birthday to you. - Look here. Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. I'm taking two of course. - Okay, take it. Bittu, why aren't you playing? Have I ever played without you? Where did you go? Mom will never go anywhere, sweetheart. Whenever you want me... ...you just have to say mom and I will be right there next to you. I am here now. Come lets go play. "A dream that has touched my eyes has shown you to me" "And transformed me into you" "Like magic, like an enchanting spell" "You smiles pulled my heart" "I am in you" "Though I am in you" "I wished for you love" "I am in you" "I became your companion" "I've loved only you" "A dream that has touched my eyes" "Until today, happiness is in abundance" "Don't why it has left me now" "Has the moonlight become darkness" "Have the smiles disappeared" "Have the sorrows followed me like a shadow" "A wound has evoked in me" "Will time show me the path" "I am you" "I am your silence" "My heart is filled with your thoughts" "Am I not there with you" "A dream that has touched my eyes" "Oh moon, come with us" "Are you hiding above" "Oh lovely rain" "At least you come" "Will you dance with us" Krishna, what is this? From now on, I will put a rupee for every time... ...we fight I will buy something with that money. Why are you blaming me? Its not only in my hands. I keep telling her I'm sorry, I'm sorry at least a hundred times a day. Saying that you're sorry a hundred times a day is fine... ...but do you tell her 'I Love You' at least once a day? Once a week? A month? Have you ever told her at least once since you've been married? Ours was an arranged marriage. She is my wife. Oh, sorry. So if she's your wife you don't have to tell her. Is that it? What are you saying? You know how much I love her. It doesn't matter if I know it, or the people around you know it. Your wife needs to know. And you need to say it. Its not like love exists only if you say it... ...but when you love someone, you must say it. Gift her something. It should be something that she loves, but she should not know that you know. Surprise her. Jawaharlal Nehru was born on November 14th and... What is this word mom? You keep reading. F-O-U-G-H-T, what is it? Go. "Don't know how far this distance takes us" "Don't know when this silence breaks" "Has the relationship vaporized" "Has the fights become your life" "And has your love become non-existent like writings written on water" "Why does this life exist anymore" "Is it to fill my eyes with tears" "I'll come with you" "I'll become your shadow" "Although you're angry at me" "Am I not there in you" What is this Krishna? It must have been a mistake. Is this a mistake? Its negligence. Its not Krishna. Just listen to me please. How many times did I tell you not to put Bittu's name on the cake? I told the baker Krishna, but he put it out of habit. What? You said don't, but the baker did it anyway. Is that it? What I'm saying is that everyone writes the name, right? So out of habit he must have put it. How does he know Bittu's name? You make the mistake, and you put the blame on everyone else. Krishna, I understand my mistakes. I really don't know how to tell you. All day I've been trying to tell you. I even got you a gift. Your words, your lies, and now you've got gifts to cheat me? What is this Krishna? Why are we fighting? Everyday, however careful I am, something or the other happens. Is this why we got married? What? Instead of staying together... ...fighting and dying like this, separating is better. Everyday some fight or the other, some tension or the other. What did you say? Tensions. What did you say before that? You said we should separate, right? Krishna that is not my intention. You said it. I didn't mean that Krishna. - You want to separate, right? I didn't say that at all Krishna. - Lets separate. If the thought wasn't in your head, you wouldn't have said it right? Krishna that is not my intention. Just listen to me once. You should have just told me. Why this torture? Krishna what are you saying? You be happy. I will not come between both of you. Both? What both? We will meet a lawyer tomorrow itself and apply for a divorce. Mom. Mom and dad have gone out. They will be back in an hour. Milk is on the table. Drink it up. Hello. Hello madam, this is Murthi speaking. I have performed the 'veneration' as you wanted. When do you want me to bring the 'offerings'? Mother isn't at home. Oh Bittu its you. Alright then, I shall call back. Okay. Now are you happy? What? There is no one to stop you. No wife... ...no son. From now you'll be happy right? With her? What are you saying? We may fight. We might not get along. But Bittu? Did you think about him? Are you that selfish? For marrying a person like you, divorce isn't enough. I should be dead. Krishna. Radha. Krishna. Krishna, Krishna. Get up Krishna. Open your eyes, Krishna. Please Krishna, wake up. Come on Krishna. Come on, come on. Krishna I cannot live without you. I cannot live without Bittu and you. Krishna, wake up. God created Human Beings, he also created Love, and the Mind. Why was God, who was able to keep a limit to the duration of human life... ...unable to keep limits on the Mind, and on Love? That is why, to further eternal love... ...God keeps bringing some people back to life again, repeatedly. English Translation: Us Few Years Later...

Please follow me. - How is she? What happened to Priya? Follow me, sir. When I'm asking you how she is. Why are you asking me to follow you? What is this following? How is she? I don't know how to tell you, Sir. What do you mean? The cities top doctors are all here. We did all the tests that the Chairman asked us to do. Who do you think Nageswara is? He's my best friend. If I tell you we became best friends in one day, will you believe it? Blood test. No copying, no memory slips. I passed. X-ray. Nageswara always talks so highly of his mother. That's enough to judge his character. ECG. Huge blackboards, hour long classes. He taught me on a piece of paper. MRI. Nageswara. - Doctor, who is this Nageswara? Who knows, doctor. Since she's been admitted she's been going on... ...and on about some Nageswara chap. I think this is a clear case of psychological disorder. Call the psychiatrist. The first time I saw Nageswara I knew there was something about him. If you have any doubts in your duties, ask Nageswara. I don't understand what you're telling me. Is she alright? She has just had a case of indigestion. Meaning? Food poisoning? Very mild food poisoning. I was hesitating to tell you because... ...I was scared you'd react and call our chairman again. That's why I said indigestion. Sir, our chairman has been torturing us for the past hour. If you could just call him and tell him that the problem is solved. Not only that I'll get him to promote you. Thank you sir. - Head of the department, next. Okay? Nageswara. - Hi. I ripped apart that exam. And us too sir. Are you Mr. Nageswara? This is the first time... ...I've heard someone's name so many times in one hour. What is this? You're prescribing some medicines. Sir, these are not for her. These are painkillers. For all of us. Okay. - Babu Rao, for me also. Starting with you, sir. Nageswara, how did you know I'm here? You told me to call at 12:30. Oh Divya told you right? Where is she? Anyway sit down. I'll tell you how I aced that marginal utility. Okay. Small request. Don't call me Nageswara. Call me Bittu. Bittu? That's so cute. Let me guess. Your mother gave you the name didn't she? You... Yes.. My mother. Perfect. Its better you avoid eating outside. It's not good. Roadside food doesn't taste good, no quality, no hygiene... ...if anything happens to you again. This is not because of roadside food, but because of our hostel food. No proper water, no ventilation, too many mosquitoes, the scent. Excuse me sir. I've have to give her saline. Sure. Please do. I'll be right back. Wait, wait. I'll be right back. One minute. Girish Karnad. Sir. In Kukatpally there is one St. Teresa's girls college and hostel. Do you know it? I know it sir. Five times, 10 times. Whatever the rate is, we need to buy it by this evening. Okay? - As you wish sir, your word is an order. Get the best interior designers... ...and landscape artists on it and do up the place. Okay, sir. One more thing. Indian, Chinese, Continental, Japanese, every kind of cuisine. I want the top chef in Hyderabad. We have to make that hostel a star hotel. Right? Right.. a five star hotel. Boys, we've had a historic youth festival. All the credit goes to Bittu. Bittu is great. Well invite Bittu also to our party. Seenu, lets wrap up for the night. How can we go home empty handed? Lets wait for a while Sir. What's there to wait for? Hey, its the cops. Yeah its the cops. Turn the bikes around. When the liquor shop is that way, why go the other way you fools. Go ahead. Its the end of the month. If they catch us, they'll fleece us. You go straight to the inspector. I'll take care of them. Have you gone mad? If we try to avoid them. They will go out of their way to catch us. If we go directly to them. I'll make them let us go. Come on guys. We can set everything right. - What an idea, my boy? Shall I go? - Come on guys. Sir, some bikes are coming. You fool. They're coming directly towards us. That means they're clear. Leave them alone. Yes you can go. Proceed. Proceed. Sir, is there any hospital nearby Sir? What is the matter? Nothing sir, just a little dehydrated that's all. Boys, you've crossed the hospital. KIMS. Really? Why turn back now Sir? Is there any hospital ahead. Go about 2km up ahead. There's a nursing home there. Oh thank you sir, thank you sir. You go. Start the bike. Start it fast. Kick hard. Check if we are on the neutral. - I think the fuel is low. Wait a minute, dude! I am trying. We just filled petrol. So try and kick properly. What are you looking at me for officer, can you kick start the bike please? Boys bike trouble? Get off the bike. Hey, take custody of the bike. No problem sir, we can manage. How much will you manage you idiots? Trying to make a fool of the police? Give me that bottle. - Sir just mineral water sir. Give it here. Water. This is water? - I swear on you sir.

Sir, sir, sir please. - Get down. Get down, you useless idiots. - Sir, sir, sir please. Sorry. Sir, please excuse us. There are only two types of drunken driving cases. If you are lucky fellows.

I can't believe it. I'm so happy today. The conversations I've missed having with Mom. The laughter I've missed with my Dad. All this and more, I've experienced in just a few days with them. There is only one thing left. just one more thing. That is to get them together. Where are you running off to? Hey Buddy. What did you get? Oh I understand. So I should show them this video. And tell them that they were married in a different lifetime. And that I am their son. No Buddy. Whats in this video are all bad memories. They both were constantly fighting. I don't want to remind them of those things. They don't need to know I'm their son. But they should never remember those fights. They must meet again. Fall in love again. And live happily ever after. Dad. What happened? Why are you bleeding? What happened? Bittu, she is Prema. We both are in love. Her family found out, and doesn't approve. They made a big issue. And we had to elope. You have to take us to a temple tomorrow and get us married. Please. You trust me, right. Of course I do Bittu. Then listen to me. Why should you elope and marry secretly? I will talk to her father and set things right for you. Can things be set right. It is for setting things right that I am here. That's why I need her fathers phone number. Prema, what's your fathers number? It'll get stained. That's alright. I'll do it. What is your fathers phone number? Oh yeah. What is your fathers name? Sir. His name is Yashwanth Rayudu. I'll send you his number. I want all his details. Yes sir. I want 10 thugs. Thugs? And not ordinary ones. They need to have huge mustaches thick beards, mole on the face... ...and weapons in their hands. Everyone should get scared when they see them. Leave it to me sir. I'll take care. I'll find ones that tremble when they see themselves in the mirror. Don't worry. Okay, I'll tell you the details later. That's where my Mom should be. You are so pretty. - You know get up, get up move. I've taken care of every thing. - Okay. Kokila... Yes Prema. You can go now. Tomorrow he will come and talk to your father and everything will be alright. Bittu. I have to go. I have taken care of everything. Don't worry at all. Just go meet him and tell him what is in your heart. Everything will be fine. Uncle. Bittu told you the absolute truth. Please trust me uncle. Understand my love. And give Prema to me. I will love Prema even more than you love Prema and look after her. You can do this. Uncle. Yes. Coming. Looks like he's planned to kill me. Why is the old man getting scared of me? Lets get him. Hey.. hey. Please, please. - Hello, brothers. Hello, please. If you don't give your daughter to our Brother. Brother. Don't do anything to me please. Here you go. When I saw everything that happened there... ...I actually suspected that I myself organized the entire thing. You shouldn't think so. Why will you do such a thing? Then where did they come from Bittu. Them and their weapons. Leave all that for now. What we need is Prema. Shall I plan your wedding in some temple. She will never come now. Why? She believes her fathers version of the story. She doesn't trust me. She thinks I arranged the entire thing. Shall I go and convince her. No need Bittu I hate her Bittu. Not just her I hate all the women in the world. I don't want a woman at all. Just because she turned out this way... ...why are you saying that you hate all women in the world. There are good girls out there. Bittu. You're a very clever guy. You've understood the nature of women and stayed single. I will follow you from now on. Don't marry, be happy. There is a soul mate out there for all of us. Even for you, there is one. She will come into your life soon. No Bittu. I won't look at women again. I will avoid them like the plague. I won't talk to them. I don't trust them anymore. Oh God! I am planning to get Mom into Dads life and he wants to stay a bachelor. I need a good plan to get them together. Come on. I am already late. Move. Follow that car. It's.. emergency. There's a patient in that car, please follow it. I'm a doctor. There's a patient inside that car. Please drop me at the hospital. Fast. Follow that car. Come on. Come. Help us take him out of the car. Please help me. Help him. Careful. Take him into emergency and call the blood bank, okay. What is your blood group? 'O' positive. Does it hurt? No, not at all. The patient needs blood urgently. Your blood group is 'O' positive universal donor. You can donate to anyone. Please take my blood. Don't worry. Taking 350 ml is not going to affect you at all. No problem, no problem. Take as much as you want. You are saving a life. Mom! Dad! Uncle, you're up? I'm Dr. Anjali Would you like some water? How are you feeling now? Did you sleep well? Take a deep breath. Do you have any pain? You're feeling better right? Good. Uncle, do you know how I found you today? It was as if you called out to me for help. I was buying something by the road, Uncle. Suddenly, I felt like someone called out to me. I came running there to find you injured, calling out for your mother. Mother. That was when he came there, Uncle. It was as if he came there just to help you. As though he was there just to bring us to the hospital. He even gave blood for you Uncle. I feel as if everything magically came together for you, Uncle. In all that confusion, I forgot to ask him his name. Food for you, Uncle. Don't get up, I will feed you. Open your mouth. I don't know if I am unlucky to have lost you at the age of 8... ...or whether I am lucky to have met you again at the age of 80. They say that when parents give life, children are born. To give me life again today, if my parents are reborn... ...then I am the luckiest person in the world. I have heard this story a thousand times from my grandmother... ...as she put me to bed. My parents love story. My grandfathers name is Bangaru Naidu. In those days, he was a very wealthy man. All the rice mills in our town belonged to him. My father was the only heir to my grandparents. His name was Sitaram. My grandfather, being a man of Gandhian principles... ...wanted my father to become a lawyer. My father was one of the few fortunate Indians to be educated in London. When in London, my father developed a craze for cars. When my grandfather unexpectedly passed away... ...father had to discontinue his studies... ...and come back home to take care of his business. Father left London behind, but not his craze for cars. This is the model which the Maharaja of Mysore has. If you approve, I can have it at your doorstep by tomorrow evening. Can you marry these cars or have children with them? I've told you a thousand times, Mom. I don't want to get married. Show me the picture. Did you hear what he said, Sharma? Let me take care of it. I will make him fall in love today. Have a look. Is that your plan? I will show him some pictures too. Sir, how is this model. Look, look at this girl. She is beautiful. - Mother, please, no. Sir, look at this car. Give me another photo. Please take a look at this. - This car... Have a look at this girl. Pretty, isn't she? - Mother, no. This car is very good. Mother, look at this girl. Pretty, isn't she? Who is this girl? There's been a small mistake. This proposal will not match your standards. They are very poor. Apart from her grandmother... ...this girl has nobody, nor does she come from wealth. Mother, what do we need? We need a wonderful girl to come into our home. And that is this girl. But her family... After marriage, her family will be mine. She will be my mothers daughter-in-law. You talk of her wealth. Our wealth is hers. Do you realize what her status will be once she marries me, Sharma? What are you waiting for? My Sitaram likes this girl. Before someone else looks at her, go and fix the match as soon as you can. I will do it at once. Sharma, give me that photo please. Here. I want this car. Sure, Sir. I don't understand this, Sharma. After rejecting so many girls, I finally accepted one. When we approached the family, they put some conditions. We agreed to all of them. Now what is this new demand asking for 6 months time before the wedding? What is the reason? I don't think this is a demand, Sir. It seems more like a request. Its only 6 months they are asking. Time will fly. What are you saying, Mother? These demands are irrelevant. I want to marry her. The car has arrived. Fantastic. Here you go. Your cheetah awaits. Thank you. My pleasure. The car is here. Now we need her to come. The issue is I wanted to marry her after seeing her photograph. If she has to feel the same way, then she needs to see me too, right? What happened to this damn thing? I will kill that salesman. Thank god it stopped here. If it stopped in her village, I would have lost face. God alone knows which parts are missing. He said its a new car If any part is required, I have to get it from London. Who is it? Hey. Come out from there. What? Why are you staring at me? Come out from under there. Come fast. Break this and give it to me. Fast. Come. Come fast. Grandma. Do I have to tell you everything? Come and hold her down. Grandma. Instead of staring at me, go get her some water. Alright I told you to stay home. Why did you come here? Why do you need to struggle in the sun? I feel you're in a hurry to go to your son and daughter-in-law. They abandoned me and passed away. Now you want to follow? Don't you love me? If you go, who do I have left? Its not that. You've asked for only 6 months time before the wedding... ...and you are working so hard. I just wanted to help out That is when Father found out why mother had asked for the 6 months. As per tradition, on the day of the wedding... ...the grooms clothes have to be given by the brides family. When he saw the struggle she was going through just to buy a pair of clothes... ...he understood the dire poverty she came from. She had to till the little land she had, harvest the crop and sell it. And then she would earn the money to buy the clothes. Realizing the efforts taken by mom to buy him clothes impressed my dad. Until then, Father only liked my mother. At that moment, he fell in love with her. What are you standing there like a statue? Give me that water. Drink. Who is this? He doesn't look like he's from our village. Can't you see? He is a thief. Someone's motor car stopped on the road. He was stealing parts from it. That is wrong, Son. You seem healthy. Why don't you work for a living? That's what I came here for. - What? To work for a living. Will you give me some water? No I won't. Go away. I helped you bring your Grandmother home. Can't you at least give me some water? When we were bringing grandma home, your were staring at me. You think I didn't notice? When did I look at you? Why would I look at you? Just because I can't speak properly don't think I'm a fool. If had met someone who talks back like you 4 days ago. What happened 4 days ago? Do you want to know what happened? My marriage was fixed. Do you know who I'm getting married to? He is a Zamindar. Such a good man. Even though I'm poor, he is marrying me. Even though he knows that I stammer, he wants to marry me. He even agreed to my Grandmother living with us after the wedding. If he finds out that you've been gazing me. He will kill you. I don't know what he saw in you that he wants to marry you. But you should know that I'm not interested in you at all. Do you know why? I'm also getting married. Only if you could see the girl I'm getting married to. She is so beautiful. Can you do me a small favour? What? I overheard you talking to your grandmother... ...about your marriage, the harvest, the clothes. All this will take at least 6 months. If I lend a hand, the same thing can be done in 3 months. 3 months? Yes. If the marriage has to happen soon, then I need to step in. Will you help me? For who? Its my need after all. Your need? Your grandmother told me to work for a living didn't she. From today I have decided to do that. But I don't have any money to pay you. Did I ask for money? If a person steals or works hard, its only for food. Anyway you cook everyday for yourself and your grandmother right? Just give me food. I will work all day. You asked for water. Drink this porridge. Sister, Sister, Sister. What? ...a ball to play. You see that abandoned car there? Take whatever you want from it. Go on! - Hey! Come all of you. Hey! I want that one. Give it to me! - No. It's mine I love you. What? That is, give me that. You said something else. I love you. What does it mean? In English, that's the way you say. Give that to me. So this thief knows English too? Just that word. Here. Thanks. Take this. Rama! I love you. What? - I love you. This? "Hey, sweet little desires have aroused in me" "My heart has done little dances" "Tiny thoughts have swung in my heart" "What to do" "My first sight is on you" "My first word is with you" "My first step is for you" "My first love is you" "I'll be with you till the end" "This word is hidden in me" "Hey, sweet little desires have aroused in me" "Tiny thoughts have swung in my heart" Sita! I love you! I love you! This one? Not that. I love you. Is it this one? That one. I love you! This? "I love you" "Means" "Give to me" "I came with love" "I won you with friendship" "Love and friendship, both are mine" "I came with light" "I became your shadow" "You're my companion in light and darkness" "My heart is beating hard because of you only" "You became my heartbeat" "Hey, sweet little desires have aroused in me" "Tiny thoughts have swung in my heart" Sita. How is it? Will he like it? I love you. Its lovely. He will definitely love it. Rama. Tell me. I will leave now. You're leaving? I told you. The work will get done in two months. The girl you're going to marry is very lucky. If you're so helpful to an acquaintance like me. Imagine how much you will care for your wife. The man you're going to marry is even more lucky. If you keep a person who is so far away so close to your heart. When you both meet he will lose himself to you. One lifetime isn't enough for such deep love Ramalakshmi. Bye. "This is Goddess Sita's wedding celebrations." "This is Lord Ram's wedding celebrations." Sita! There is a different time for first night ask him to tie the knot. Sita its time to tie the knot. Rama! - Yes! I love you. Please give it to me this way. "You came as my friend" "You became my husband" "You have gifted me life" "We are two people" "We grew up as one" "We are turning to three in our love" "You have shared me love" "You have treated me as a child" "Now our love has become a child" "Hey, sweet little desires have aroused in me" "Tiny thoughts have swung in my heart" "Hey, sweet little desires have aroused in me" "My heart has done little dances" "Tiny thoughts have swung in my heart" "What to do" "My first love is you" "I'll be with you till the end" "This word is hidden in me" "Hey, sweet little desires have aroused in me" "Tiny thoughts have swung in my heart" Let me check. You still have fever. There is no way you can come with us. Then you don't leave me and go. Chaitanya. - Rama. I am coming. Mother. You carry on. Chaitanya is not well I will stay with him. I can not go there without you Rama. They told us so many times that we both have to be there. But he has fever. My mother and your grandmother will take care of him. Anji. Anji, what are you doing? Venkaiah. Yes sir. Venkaiah come here, take him away. Anji Give him something to eat. He will stop barking then. Lets go Rama. This movement is to end the foreign rule over us. Everyone will have to come together to make this movement a success. Civilians must become soldiers. Praises to Mother India Gandhiji has come all the way from Delhi they have gone to meet him. They will return this evening. - Where is the little one? Grandma. What is it? - My stomach hurts grandma. Stomach ache? Call Mother and Father, now. Mom. Drive faster. I am. We will be there in 5 minutes. I told you that I would not come. Rama, Mother is with him. She will take care of him. Nothing will happen to him. What if he is in a lot of pain? He must be struggling. Look, please don't cry. I can't bear your tears. You know that, don't you? Here take this. Rama. Rama, don't cry. What if he is in pain? I hope nothing happens to him. Nothing will happen to him. He will take on our life and live a very long life. 80 years have passed... ...without me knowing whether it was their blessing or Gods curse. I have spent so much time in hurt and guilt... ...searching for ways to redeem myself of my mistake. I prayed to God many times... ...if a mistake of a child warranted such a huge punishment. I lost my parents when I pretended to have pain that I didn't. But God brought them back to me when I was really in pain. My responsibility now is to help my parents live a long and happy life... ...together with children... ...grandchildren and great-grandchildren... ...just as I have lived mine. She isn't wearing a toe ring. That means she is not married. What about father? I should find out. What happened? You seem distracted. Nothing like that. Until now I've seen and met many women, but never felt anything. I've always been consumed by work and nothing else. Somehow. when I saw this girl, my heart began to beat faster. The closer she came, the faster it beat. Oh my God! That's so sweet. You finally in love. Tell me, tell me, tell me. Who is this girl? She is... Wait a minute. Apparently a lot is happening behind my back. Anyway, its alright. It is enough if you like her. I mean its not like there's any rule that I should also like her, is there? Oh, no. Look here. How can I do anything you don't like? You have to approve everything. If that's the case, I have a few conditions. The girl has to be very beautiful. She must have long hair. And... We must find out her family background. - Okay. In matters of marriage, that is very important. What does she do? She is a doctor. Doctor? Wow. Doctor? There should be a doctor at home Bittu. If anything happens to anyone she will take care. Bittu, you're running such a high temperature. Why didn't you tell me? Come lets go to the doctor. - I don't have fever. Oh God. We will go to our doctor. Come, come. - Okay. If we tell the receptionist the doctors name, we can get her details easily. What is her name? I don't know. What? Love without knowing her name? Alright, do you at least know the patients name? No. Then how are we supposed to find her? When she's near, my heart beats faster. Oh I see. Is your heart some kind of GPS? We have to search everywhere. Come on. - Okay. Do you feel anything? - No, my heart is beating normally. Wait. God knows where she is. Okay, come. What happened? She is definitely somewhere nearby. How do you know? Beating faster is it? Lets go. Its you. Yes. And you. I'm taking care of the patient. You? I came to see you... I gave blood, right. I came to take it. You want your blood back? Yes. No, no, no. I came to inquire how it is working. How the blood is working? Well, its working quite well. Please, come in. Do you like her? Bittu, she's perfect. I love her. Hello, Uncle. Are you better? Much better. I'm very well. I'm so happy. So happy. Uncle, you remember him? How can I forget him? We have a blood relationship don't we? You've helped me so much, but I didn't even get to ask your name. What is your name? I'm Nageswara Rao. You can call me Nageswara. Hi, I'm Anjali. Hi. Cardiologist. Bittu she's a cardiologist. Shall we tell her? About your hear beating faster. What happened? What is it, dear? - Uncle? Are you unwell? I'm fine Uncle. Its nothing. - Bittu. Just tell her. In any case why don't you get a check up? Its better. Why don't you... Come. - Go. Go, Bittu. Okay. Tell me. I feel my heart beating faster than usual. When do you feel that? Remember we met in the car yesterday? I felt it then. And now again, I felt it when I came to the hospital. You opened the door, and it got back to normal. Your heart is absolutely fine. So far I've been taking care of everything. But now, we have to discharge you. If a family member of yours comes... Uncle. What happened, Uncle? Why are you crying? Its nothing. You said discharge, right? If you just give me the bill, I will pay and leave. Alone? No, no. Lets call your family. There isn't anyone to call. What do you mean Uncle? I'm all alone. How can I let you go like that? We shall go to my apartment. There's nobody there but me. It will be peaceful. Anyhow, we have to check you daily, right. Excuse me do you have to check him every day? Do you have to check Uncle every day? Then there is a problem. If Uncle is at your place he will be left unattended... ...when you come to the hospital right? There is only one solution for this. - What? Let uncle come and stay at my house. I don't have a problem, but it is Uncles choice. Uncle. - I'm not okay with that. What? Why? I don't want to be a burden on your wife and children. I'm not married yet. I don't have children. - What? I'm single. I'm a bachelor. Apart from my parents, there is nobody else in my heart. You will come everyday, right? Welcome Uncle. Hi, Buddy. This is my best friend, Buddy. What are you looking at? That car? Since I was young I've been crazy about that car. Come, I will show you to your room. Sorry, sorry. Praise the Lord Father. May the Lord be praised. Its not enough that you look at the floor. You have to look up and down when you're walking. Fa.. Fa.. Father. Fa.. Fa.. Father. Praise the Lord Father. Raise this father, my son! Is it hurting, Father? Its exploding, my son. Oh God. It looks like your back is broken. Come on, Father. Shall I get some medicine for you? Shut it and go, my son. As you wish. Bye. Father, praise the Lord. The Lord may... oh. What is this? I can smell alcohol in the hostel. My son. Praise the Lord Father. Praise the Lord Father. May the Lord be praised. What happened my Son? Sit, sit. My heart has been destroyed Father. I understand. 40 years back, the same thing happened to me. That is why I'm like this now. Really? Meaning that Prema hurt your heart too? Its because my heart got hurt that I became a father to idiots like you. Otherwise I would have been a father to my own children. Father, Father, Father. If you have a spare dress, please give it to me. I will also become a Father like you. Don't play with the my faith, my son. I can understand your broken heart and drunken soul. Love is always pure. If at all there are problems, they arise only because of humans. But there is no connection between those people and me, Father. No, my son. You shouldn't say things like that. You and those people are one. No, Father. - Yes, my son. No, Father. No, I am not agreed. - Yes. Yes, my son. That side. That side. "Love is so sweet." "Parting is very difficult." Get out! Bittu, Bittu, Bittu. Hey! Who are you? Isn't Bittu here? No Bittu, no Kittu. Get out of here. Drinking at this age. I must've come to the wrong house. Sorry, sorry. My mistake. I think I drank too much and came to next house. Why did you come again? Is Mr. Nageswara Rao here, Sir? Oh you've come for him? Looking at you, I thought you were the owner of the house. You work here then? - Hey! What's your name? Chai. Chaitanya. Oh God. Chai, Chaitanya. You say it as if you're Bond, James Bond. Not bad. You have a youthful name. Not just in my name. In me, too. That's good for me, then. I will give you something to do, Mr. Chai. You can bring my luggage in. Hey! How dare you? You tell a man your grandfathers age to bring in your luggage? If you're as old as my grandfather, then I'm as old as your grandson. Can't you do it for your grandson? And you were saying that there's youth in you. Go on. Give it a try. Its not your fault. I will talk to Bittu. Hey! Hey! - Bittu! Bittu! Dad! When did you come? - Hi Bittu! Bittu, what is this? Why is your housekeeper wearing such expensive clothes? You should hire young and strong staff. He is right. You should hire him. He is fit enough. He will be able to clean the floor and wash the clothes. What is this Bittu? - Calm down. He is a very important person. His name is Chaitanya. This is my father... I mean my best friend, Nagarjuna. Why are you close to people who drink in the middle of the day and cause trouble? Bittu. I drank during the day because of that. Yes. Every drunkard has a reason to get drunk. Hey Bittu! I need another drink. - Okay, dad! Sure, dad! - Let's go to the bar. Give him a full bottle. He will drink and fall flat. Bittu. That crazy Francis. What did he do? What's it to him if I drink Bittu? Yes, you were drinking outside somewhere. What's it to him? No Bittu, I drank in the hostel only. even if you drank in the hostel you wouldn't have created a nuisance right? No Bittu. I drank, and then I threw up a little. What's the big deal? When people drink a little too much they do throw up. You can clean that. Bittu, if it falls on the floor, someone can clean it. He came and stood right in front of me. A little bit fell on his shirt. If it fell on his clothes he can change them, right? When I threw up, a little fell in his mouth. Because of that he got mad. He could have warned me, fined me. How can he send me out of the hostel? - Correct. That's a bit much? That isn't called sending out. Its called throwing out. Mr. Chaitanya. I'm keeping quiet because you are Bittu's close friend. Otherwise... Even I'm keeping quiet because you're close to him. Otherwise... Why are you even friends with this drunkard? Two young guys will obviously be friends. Why would he hang out with an old man like you. Hey! Hey! Hey! Old? Who are you calling old? Everyone becomes old someday. You will also become old. Old is diamond, not gold. You call yourself young? Do you even know what being young is? In my day do you know what fun I had? What romance I did? For all that, you need discipline. If you keep drinking like this, you will become old in no time. Is it your heart that broke, or your love that failed? You are you preaching so much. If you ever failed in love once, you will understand what I'm going through. Every drunkard uses the excuse of failed love to drink. What rubbish. Why don't you quit drinking? Alright. But I will quit after you have a drink with me. Me? Yes. Have a drink with me. After that I will stop. Useless fellow. You go ahead and drink if you want, spoil your own health. Why are you asking him to join you? Don't worry so much about him. Even I have love for him. He is as important to me as he is to you. What say, Bittu? You have a drink with me, Bittu. I can't understand who this guy is? Here, take this. What is this? I think I will fall flat just with the smell. Why are you entertaining him? Why are you drinking when you don't have the habit? Uncle, do you drink? Me? Once in a while. - Yes. Then drink this. Me? In front of you? Not in front of me. Behind me. Here. Behind you? Alright give it here. I will drink it. Cheers, Bittu. You drank the full thing without waiting for me? He is new to this, right? Gulped it down. Drink slowly, Bittu. Don't listen to the old man. Yes, drink slowly. Uncle, Uncle. Where is he? Where is Uncle? What is this? You drank and you are steady. He didn't drink but he is swaying? I'm not swaying. I'm very steady. Something's not right here. You have to drink this in front of me now. I won't believe it until I see. Drink it all up. Drink. Did you see that? "Hey! No stopping!" "We are losing." "Let's party everybody!" "Open the bottle." "Bring a glass." "Fill it to the brim." "Let's enjoy the drink." "You will get high." "Enjoy to the fullest." "Party all night" "Lead life like a king." "I see heaven when I have that nectar." "Ditch you sorrows, go ahead and keep smiling." "Drink! Drink! Drink the entire thing!" "Irrespective of date or time, when you drink this, you become the King." "Go ahead and drink the whole thing." "I am losing my mind." "Do you think you are losing your state of mind." "Man! Oh my man! Think over it!" "We are the finest in the town!" "I was born." "Society was overjoyed when I was born." "When I cried, world smiled at me." "When I smiled, it was world's turn to cry." "I don't have any more business in this world." "I don't care!" "We don't care." "Say this! Say it all." "Don't be shy! Come over and dance." "Come and be the king of night." "King! This is a calling." "Come on and dance with us." "Open the bottle!" "Take a glass!" "Drink it fully." "Come let's have a drink." "Go ahead and drink the whole thing." "Society was overjoyed when I was born." "When I cried, World smiled at me." "When I smiled, it was world's turn to cry." "I don't have any more business in this world." "I don't care!" Bittu. - You must call me Bittu. Bittu. What is that smell? I smell Alcohol. Uncle. Don't disturb me. Uncle. - Oh, you. Uncle. What is this? Did you drink? We gave him just two small pegs. Doctors say its good for the heart no? Did you give him his medicines last night? You don't take the medicines that doctors prescribe... ...but you will drink using the doctors name. Actually, you see... What is this Mr. Nageswara Rao? I sent Uncle with you thinking you will take good care of him. But you're behaving so irresponsibly. Its not his fault at all. Okay. It is not his fault. But... Why did you drink? Me... He is there, right All drunk Its all because of him. He is the one to blame. Get up, you. Who hit me? You're able to feel someone hitting you is it? God. The old man has started early in the morning. What is this Bittu? T-shirt, jeans. If you got ready so early... ...then its definitely for some girl. Hello, good morning. I am Nagarjuna. - Anjali. I don't think he has sobered down yet. Go wash your face. Oh God. I didn't sleep next to you out of any love. I got drunk and fell next to you, that's all. Old man is getting flattered. Bittu, your clothes, this changeover, all for this girl, right? What do you think of her? Perfect match. But is everything ok from her side too? Who knows? Bittu, in this generation... ...for chemistry to happen, there must be some physics involved. By physics I mean, you know, some physical contact. Like salsa. Arrange for a dance class. The chemistry will happen automatically. After that, she will be all yours. Now let me go in and chat with her. Okay, okay, okay. - You don't worry. Doctor. You have given me such good idea to get mom and you together. Mom also loves to dance. Just watch the fun now. Priya. What happened? Why are you crying? I am not crying. Come, lets go shopping for dance class. What dance? Our college is conducting a program on valentines day for the first time. Both of us have been selected for it. From tomorrow, two weeks full salsa. Come on. - Lets go. If this was for routine dancing, I wouldn't have come. This is salsa. We can actually get to touch a girl. That's why I came. This is a college arranged dance event. There won't only be anyone worth it here. By accident if a good-looking one comes along. All the guys will be after her. This is only an official way to cut classes. Thank you. - You have unrealistic expectations. One can keep hoping dude. He didn't look all that docile. He was profusely sweating. I am sure he was... Hello. Excuse me. Don't, Radha. Stay away from me. I don't want anything between us again. Radha? What Radha? Why Radha? Who Radha? I am Nagarjuna. You can call me Nag. Why did you call me? My kerchief. Thank you. Sorry. - Hello, hello, hello madam. "Come on! Get on the dance floor!" My name is Leonardo DiCaprio! You all know why you are here. So I won't waste too much of your time. Really? Promise? 100% - Very good, very good. Keep it up. Dance is an art. And when it comes to salsa, you all have to be in the mood. And for you to be in the mood... - Hi. ...you need a romantic partner. Only then can you do justice to salsa. - Hi. In dance there must be passion, compassion, romance and chemistry. Okay, now we shall start the pairing. Nagarjuna? Me. - Good looking. Come. Sir, how are you? Yeah good, good. Now lets call the lady. Yes lets call her. Please. Please. - I think its her. Hey Priya. Priya. Cute, isn't she? Come, come. Sir, thank you sir, thank you sir. She's perfect for you. Yes perfect for me sir. Happy sir, very happy sir. - You're happy right? You're happy, I'm happy. - Thank you sir. Now look here. I want the chemistry between you two be of cosmic levels. There should be love. - Okay, sir. Okay sir. - There should be affection. Now what about me? Master, I have a question. - Yes. Please set something for me too please. Am I a broker to set something for you? I will kick you. Find someone for yourself. Come on guys. All of you choose your pairs. - Where are you my dear? Yeah. Good, good. I can keep my hand around her waist, right? Of course you must. - No problem, sir. Hold her waist there's no problem. - Thank you, sir. You remember Priya? I want chemistry between you. Music. Nagarjuna, hold her properly. Cut, cut, cut. What happened? What happened? Nothing is happening. What did you say? That you wanted romance, right? Definitely. Without eye contact how romance will happen? It will never come. She is not looking. - What? Eye contact. Eye contact. What happened? Do you have a problem with your eyes? I am looking, sir. I don't see that happening. When you look at him, you must floor him with your eyes. Only then will romance come. Have you understood? Nagarjuna look at her. Is it coming? Has it come? - Yes master its coming. Start music master. Its coming master. - Don't be shy. Hold her. Very good. Music. Yes. Cut, cut, cut, cut. What happened now? What is the problem? What is this master? How will there be romance without a smile? She isn't smiling? Why should I smile? I am dancing right? Oh Prabhu Deva. To dance gracefully, you should smile, my dear. Dance with a smile, there is no problem. Not like that. Smile properly. Smile wide. I am smiling. - Yes good. She is smiling Nagarjuna. She is smiling master, yes she is smiling. Romance is coming master. Start music. Start, start, start. All the best Nagarjuna. Start the music. - I am able to feel the romance now. The guy at the counter took a long time. That is why I made special coffee for you. I realized that if you like someone we can do anything for them. Excuse me. Don't touch my phone. Don't you dare touch my phone. Wait, wait, wait. Why are you staring at it shamelessly? To even sit here, don't you have any. - Clock tower signal. There is a tree opposite it. Time around 10:20. Maybe 30-31 days back. Look here. Unbelievable. This is destiny. This is fate. It brings people together even if they don't want it to. What nonsense. This isn't destiny or fate. Don't you understand the concept of coincidence? Some things just happen for no reason at all. Stupid. Ladies first, ladies first, Ladies always have to be. No call yet. Dance class would've gotten done by now. Its 5:30. Call me. It is dad! Hello. - I am finished Bittu. What happened? I've come for a dance class from college Bittu. You should see my partner. - Bye. You have to see her to believe it. What's her name? Priya, Bittu. Priya. I haven't seen such a beautiful girl. But Bittu, you should have seen how much I tried to get her to smile today. Everything blew up in my face. What happened? Why? Who knows Bittu? Fate, destiny... Move that's my car. - ...phosphate, sulphate. That's my car. - Hello. What? Who are you talking to? Yeah that's what Bittu. In the potassium permanganate and sodium nitrate in the. What are you saying? You are saying something about potassium permanganate? Come on! - I don't understand what you say. In the potassium permanganate and sodium nitrate.. When sulfur dioxide mixes with. I don't understand what you are saying. My chemistry just physically went away now. I will come home and tell you everything okay? Bye. Okay, bye. Mom. As you asked, Priya is going for the dance class from today. Thank you mother. Ma? Ma. Why didn't you call me? I've been waiting for your call for so long. Bittu. I was just thinking about you. Sit, sit. How was your day? Forget about my day. Tell me about yours. Did you do anything new today? Oh yes I just remembered. I am going for a dance class from today. Oh wow dance class. Did you meet somebody interesting? New dance partner? Waste Bittu. Is there a problem with your dance partner? I don't even remember that dance partners face. You don't even remember his face? From now on you will remember every minute. Just one minute. That stupid dance master. Idiot. Leonardo. Hey, come fast. - What happened? Class would have started. - Oh okay. What happened? Why did you stop? Nothing. Lets go. Hi, girls. How's my landing? Why did you come down like that? The lift wasn't working. There isn't a lift here at all. No lift, lift not working, isn't it all the same? Judging by your behavior yesterday, I thought you wouldn't come today. I also thought of leaving. But you gave a signal from your car, right? I heard that and stayed behind. Car sound signal. For you? Yes, yes. Get a life. Good morning bloody nasty students. I was shouted at by the high command for the lack of romance between you all. So we are going to increase the dosage today. Nagarjuna... Priya Today we are going to introduce a new step. What is that? How do I explain? What I mean is that today when you dance, your hearts must become one. Okay sir. Okay sir. It should be very strong you see performance. Performance. - That's performance. Yeah, yeah. - Performance. Strong? Alright. Alright. Will give a strong one. - Okay so sweet. Okay Nagarjuna, she said she would give it. You take it. - Sure sir. Oh God! Oh no! I'm so happy. A communication has started between us. Of course, its not a must that you have to react as sweetly as me... ...but as long as you react, its all good. Hey listen. What exactly is your problem? You come to me, talk nonsense. I get angry just listening to your voice. I love you. What is this? You asked me to give this to you right? What? You asked for this didn't you? Not this? This? You heard it that way? Give me that. Who is your gardener? Ask him to talk to me. - Sure. He isn't taking care of them well. They should be treated like children. Why are you staring at me? Are you wondering why I'm looking at them? You want me to tell them the truth right? Parents can bear any pain for their children... ...but knowing that their child has little time to live, will break them. If desire is strong enough, I believe that my wish will come true. My desire now is only that I be born again to them. Why hasn't she come yet? Your partner hasn't come? Is that why you are not dancing? Don't worry. She will come. Okay. Girish Karnad. Sir. Tomorrow is my birthday. You know that don't you? I know Sir. Feb 13. I want you to arrange a grand party. How come Sir? You normally never celebrate your birthday... ...because your parents passed away the next day. I'm telling you. Arrange a party. Okay sir. There are two important guests whom I will invite myself. I will arrange everything Sir. Right. I've done everything you asked. Priya? Leave Priya to me. Getting her there is my responsibility. Thank you so much Bittu. You are the best friend in the whole world. Hello. - Hi, sir. How are you? - Greeting, sir. Thank you for coming. Uncle? What a fantastic car. What's this Uncle? A small gift from me to you. You being with me itself is a huge gift. Please. It will make me happy. This is a gift I cannot refuse. I love this car. I love you, Uncle. I love you. I thought you wouldn't come. Why would you think that I wouldn't come? you're a bit late. I assumed you wouldn't come. Tell me. How do I look? What is this? Gift. Traditional clothes. I really liked them. They will look good on you. Don't laugh okay? Give it here. I've been waiting so long to hear you say that. I love you too. I love you three. I love you four. I love you five. That's the car sir gave instructions about. I will go inform him. - Okay. Good evening, Madam. Sir is waiting for you inside. Okay. - This way. Alright. Go in that way. - Sure, ma'am! I love you Krishna. If I had another second of life left in me then... ...those would've been my last words to you. The first time I saw you in this life... ...they should have been my first words to you. Then, I didn't know that I had to tell you, and so I didn't. Now even though I want to tell you so badly... ...the situation never presented itself. Not today. I remembered our past on that day itself. That night the thunder woke me up. I saw you next to Bittu. Instantly I knew I had met you before. I slowly got reminded of us, our past. I remembered everything Krishna. How much you loved me, how much I made you suffer, I remember all of it. I wanted us, who left Bittu and went away. To go back to him as his mother and father. But that night, it became clear to me that you could not stand me Krishna. In that life we had an arranged marriage, Krishna. You came into my life without any effort from my part... ...I didn't realize your worth. Even so, I never betrayed you. I never cheated on you. Leave aside love that lasts across births. Was your hate for me in our past life all that lasted? They say that if there is love, even sins are forgiven. For a mistake I never committed, do I deserve this punishment Krishna? I am not asking you to love me now. Scold me, hit me, fight with me. But don't distance me from you. I am telling you this out of fear that we may not get this chance again. Without you, death is far better than life Krishna. Priest, Good morning. Sir, today is your parents death anniversary... ...so if you tell me when you're coming for the ceremony... ...I can make the arrangements... Sharmaji, Sharmaji. There won't be any need for that from now on. What do you mean sir? I mean that there is no need anymore. Good day. Lakshmi! Uncle. 102 degrees. This is the effect of last nights party. You have to stay on bed all day today. Complete rest. Alright? Anjali. Uncle, I will be right back. Anjali - What happened? They've gone out. There's an oil leak. The brakes will fail again. Everything is happening just like before. Call and tell I've been trying. Their lines are gone. Where have they gone? Lakshmi said that they have gone to the Srinivasa temple. Don't worry. Nothing will happen to them. Come, lets go. Buddy, stop it! Buddy, shut up! - No! Buddy! Security. Come and take him away. - Sir. Come soon. Go on. Move it. - Okay, sir. Anjali come. Come soon. - Okay. Lakshmi, Lakshmi. - Coming. Where have they gone? They've gone to the Srinivasa temple. Please stop. Auto. Please stop. My family has gone ahead in a car. The brakes aren't working. They are in danger. Will you help me please? Priya. No, Krishna. Should I call you Krishna or Priya? Call me Priya. Okay, Priya. Yes, Mr. Nagarjuna. See! They are there! Priya, Priya wear your seat belt. The brakes are not working. Bittu. - Dad. Bittu, the brakes aren't working. I will do something. Hold on. - Okay. Mom! Mom! Are you okay? Bittu! Bittu! - Dad! Thank you so much, Bittu. You have come at the right moment! - Dad! Are you okay? - Okay, Bittu. Yeah. Thank you, Bittu. I can't believe this. My God! - You guys are okay? Uncle. - Uncle. Oh no. Uncle. - Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. - Are you okay? Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Are you okay? Thank you so much Uncle. You came at the right time. Otherwise the lorry would've definitely hit us. Uncle, thank you so much! - Thank you so much! You saved us! - You came at the perfect time. Thank you so much uncle. - Dear! It wasn't me who saved you. Really? - What? He was somewhere here, that boy. Look there! "Cheers for the Star." "Yeah! Cheers to him." "Cheers for the Star." "Cheers!" "He is the man! Ah! Ah! Akhil!" "He is the star! Reaches the sky." "He is the star! Ah! Ah! Akhil!" Granddad, you're okay, no? - Okay. What was that? Hi, I am Akhil. Dad! - You are all we see! You are everything! You will always remain in our memories. Srinath ;-)
