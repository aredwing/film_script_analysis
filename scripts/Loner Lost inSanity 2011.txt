All the household work... every work... ...market cooking... gas electric bill, telephone bill, parents/teachers meeeting, society problems... ...everything I have to handle... And still I have no value in this house... How will I be valued? For that someone should be there at home at least. One is busy hanging out with his friends... ...and the other is busy with meetings in different cities... And if I go to speak anything... they loose their tempers. Before getting married I never thought Gaurav would ever hit me. But he doesn't hit me too much... For hitting me a lot he should be at home a lot right? Don't you know if he hits his other girlfriends too... Or maybe he's more romantic towards those bitches! I don't even remember when was the last there was romance between us. Ritu was saying she'll be sending some of his snaps in a few days. After seeing those snaps I will come to know who all he is being having fun with... Bard! Sometimes I think I'll go insane thinking about them. Uff! Where is the big knife gone missing? This Rony has become such a spoiled brat. What does he do the entire day opening all electronic gadgets God knows. Surely he must have kept it somewhere. Never seen him do anything productive ever. Can't answer... Not at all. Since the past 2-3 weeks there have been no calls, no news. And now when I am stuck with this fng pumpkin. I can't answer... I can't! So your back now? Class got over 2 hours back. Rony... keep your bag in its given place... Rony!!! My words are of no value here. You'll realise my worth only after I die. Damn!.. What the... The door jammed again... Mom!! Momm!! Now I am just left being a housemaid. What happened? bLONER bLONER INSANITY bLONER LOST (in)SANITY bSubtitle edited by "Smoyl"
