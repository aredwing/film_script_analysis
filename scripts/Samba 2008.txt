Sure, I'll keep it. - Want anything? - I'm ok. Positive? - Go on. - Thanks. I'm coming back. The big guy's keeping my place. He's my brother. A sabbatical to do charity work? That's right. Stay behind me for now. Just watch and take notes. Don't worry, it'll go fine. You can park here. This is good. Hurry it up. Ouch. Shit! We have 48 hours to get these guys out. We gotta move fast. You know the basics. Yes. Well, refresh my mind. It's been a while. Never give your number or address or you'll get calls at night and guys sleeping on your doormat. Come on. Hello. Hello, ladies. ID, metal items and phones in the tray. Thank you. Shit! - Arms up. - Jesus... Your arms. I've been 100 times! Ok. I need to spell that one out? - Go ahead. - Thanks. I don't have one. Go ahead. Hello. Have a seat. No, Alice, here. Sorry. Let's get started. What's your name? Samba Ciss. Been in France long? Almost ten years. Tell us what happened. Take notes, Alice. I've worked in catering for some time now. I'm moving from dishes to food preparation. Good. Three days ago, my boss offered me a contract. I'd applied for a residence permit. I thought the contract would help, so I took it to Immigration. Apparently, my application had already been refused. But I never got the letter. Our mailbox system is a mess. And well.... they arrested me. They arrested you? The fuckers! I thought that too. I note that? No. Got the rest? Can you give me a second? Another shit storm! Are you ok? Yes, I'm ok. And you? Yes, I'm ok. I'm a bit hungry but I'm ok. I might have... some cereal bars. Thank you. Is it musk? No, it's whole wheat and... Your perfume. Is it musk? Yes. What are the pills for? I have trouble sleeping. Especially at night. I'd like some too, please. Which ones? The ones to sleep at night. I have some Imovane... They're strong sleeping pills. I also have Lysanxia... Some Lexomil too... What do you suggest... as a starter? Sleeping pills maybe. All of them? Thank you. They have two Pashtuns for us. Where were we? A police ruling put you here. We'll fight for your rights and go to court to get you out. - Got that? - I've got it. Got proof of presence in France? Yes. Any family here? My uncle. I live with him. He's been in France 25 years, he's legal. He works in a restaurant too, the kitchen of a fancy place. Just a sec. Get his uncle's details. Note what he needs. A clean shirt can help with the judge. It counts. We'll try to see the A before you're sent to the PRJ. Hello? Yeah... Yes, it's me, stupid, you called me. What are the AT and the PRJ? We'll let her explain all that. Let me take your number. Your uncle's, I mean. Yes. 06... 94... 53... 51... Can I have yours too? No... I can't... I don't... I can't. 0613... Goodbye. Is he likely to get out? Which one? Samba. We can try. 10 years here with work but no wife or kids. It'll be tough. What if the judge says no? If he says no, we go to see him and say, "Your Honor, please, he's a nice, easy-going guy. Let us keep him." - That can work? - Are you kidding? Of course I'm kidding. He may get a one-way to Dakar with no stop in duty-free. It's that bad? Here's a word of advice... Protect yourself. Keep your distance. It's important. Or it'll hurt if they're sent back. No worries on that level. - You didn't give him your number! - Of course not! - Sure? - You told me not to. Goodbye. Nigeria? Let's get started. You sound like the BBC. Keep it simple. Try more... international English or we'll get nowhere. I have a year's residence permit, a three-month provisional one and a month-old OLFT. Let me get this clear... When was your one-year permit? So, if I sum it all up, someone is housing you. But I'll need his name. For instance, if he's Mr. Duval... I'll write Mr. Duval. That's him. Who? Mr. Duval. Mr. Duval is housing you? Yes. No, he doesn't. Got any pay slips in that name? Yes. I work at Eurodisney as a versatile cast member. What's a versatile cast member? After that, red paper. After... Red paper, then no more! All right... "No more", fine. But "no more" what? Red paper, then... no more. Versatile cast member? One day, I'm Captain Hook... Another day, I'll be... Buzz Lightyear or the Lion King. But no women like Cinderella or Minnie. Pity, you'd make a great Little Mermaid. This is our address. Immigration gave you this? Serbian is tough... Red paper, then no more! Russki? Do you speak Russian? You speak Russian? Good. Does anyone speak Russian? Mr. Jebli, you didn't come by bus. The Canaries are islands. It would be a very odd bus. Yes, I came by odd bus. Pass me the globe. I need help. I get it. Wonderful. He got red paper... Then... "No more". You're not eating? I can't, no flavor. Doing nothing makes me hungry. May I? Thanks. Been here long? Ten days. Where from? Congo. Brazzaville. - And you? - Senegal. I've been here ten years. I thought I was safe but... they caught me. Dumb, huh? Yeah, that's dumb. It took me two years to get here. I fled the civil war. I traveled on trucks, on foot in the desert, country after country, to get arrested in the metro. Dumb, huh? What's your name? Jonah, like in the Bible. - And you? - Samba, like the dance. Delighted, Samba. Hello... I need to see a gentleman who works in the kitchen, Lamouna Saw. - Can you help? - Yes. Have a seat. I'll check. Tell me something. Had any affairs here? Yes, I've had some. Mostly with the police. There are some cute policewomen. I've had affairs but nothing really serious. There's no time for it. You work, send money back home and try not to get caught. - So you've had nothing. - I have! I've had three, four, five... I've had some, yeah. I came here to get married. You did? Go on. Tell me about it. We worked together in Spain in tomato greenhouses. One morning, there was a police raid. I ran off to the village to get away. I ran like crazy. A door opened, a hand grabbed me... Her hand! Her hand, you got it. We stayed there, pressed together for hours among the trashcans. Tell me what she's like. Describe her to me. Beautiful, slim and tall like those girls who do fashion shows. A model, you mean. A model! - She's a model? - Right. What's her name? Gracieuse. Right, Gracieuse... She knows you're here? I've no idea. It's two years since I saw her. Wait here please. Lamouna! Someone to see you. - Chef? - Go on. Filed by year since 2004. Prescriptions, bank letters and statements. Very good. His white shirt. Plus a T-shirt. He'll be glad to have that. He's very fond of it. I nearly forgot... I added two macaroons: vanilla and lime-basil. His favorites. Lime-basil smells nice. Ma'am, my nephew is a decent boy. - He is? - Yes, really. See? The undocumented have documents. But not the right ones... That's what's missing. Goodbye. Sorry. Not bad. A real highlighter! You may as well start packing. He can't wear that crap in court. But it's important for him. I think it's a lucky charm. He's screwed from the word go. You really can't wear that. But it's my lucky T-shirt. Can I wear the shirt over it? Maybe. But otherwise... try the shirt with nothing under it. To compare the two. All right. To compare the two. Yes, exactly. Yeah, sure. You're ogling him! I'm not. You're ogling. I'm not ogling. Sorry, you're comparing. Get him to try the jeans without boxers. To compare... Silly. I mentioned keeping your distance, right? That's good. Much better. Change nothing. I'll go see to the others. Stay calm and compare, ok? That's good. It's much better. I'm disappointed not to wear the T-shirt... I'll look after it. Didn't my uncle give you anything else? He did. Two macaroons. And? I think I ate them. - Both of them? - Yes. Ok... After losing his father ten years ago in a construction accident near Dakar, Mr. Samba Ciss had to give up school, leave his mother and sisters to come to France and provide for his family. He has mostly worked washing dishes at night and has trained to become a cook. He has just been promised a contract... We know all that. Mr. Ciss, do you have family in France? Shit! Yes, my uncle. That's all? Yes. The hearing is suspended. - What does that mean? - She hasn't decided yet. I'll explain everything. Shall we talk to the judge? What? Nothing... I should've worn the T-shirt. - All set. - Hold on. What's going on? I have to go to her. I'm going crazy here! Hold on... Stay here! Let go of me! Brother, wait! They'll put you in jail for real! You're not thinking. Listen! I won't stay locked up here! I came to get married. I'm going! Get down! Get down! That's enough. Get back inside. There's nothing to see. Everything's ok. Move it. Samba... I heard my name. - Yes? - I heard my name. Get your things. Am I free to go or... No idea. Just get your things. Ok. I hope it works out for you. I just know she works in a beauty salon in Barbs. Find her. Tell her I'm here. Gracieuse... Good luck. Thanks. Excuse me... I don't get it. What happens now? You still have an OLFT. The Obligation to Leave French Territory. You can go. You mean, I can go right now? Yes, you're free but you're here illegally and have to leave France. All right. Fine. I'll go home then. Exactly. The airport's that way? To leave France, I go that way. I'll try to catch that plane there. All right. My plane! That's my plane! Wait for me, captain! Wait for me! I have to leave! I'm leaving on that one! An OLFT is bad. You'll have to be even more discreet. Look at your signet ring. It screams "illegal immigrant". Ten years here, you still don't get it. I get it, don't worry. From now on, you must dress differently. European-style. Jacket, pants and a briefcase, like a businessman. Take a magazine, slip it under your arm and dump your jeans and rotten old shoes! Be quiet and discreet like I taught you. And don't go out drunk! I don't drink! That only happened once! Let me finish! Avoid train stations and subway hubs. After 6 pm, take the bus instead. And don't cheat on the subway. They can deport you for a ticket. I'm looking for Gracieuse. I don't know her. She doesn't work here? Hello. I'm looking for Gracieuse. I don't know her. What's going on, Samba? Everything's fine, Mom. I was just a bit sick. I worked less but I'm fine now. Don't get lazy. How's the cooking course going? It's going really well. I'll get my diploma soon. If you don't work, it's your fault! I'll send money, I promise. I'll send you money, calm down. I'll send some. Hurry, the grocer's getting tetchy. Don't worry, I'll send it soon. Say hi to everyone and tell them I'm fine. Thanks, Mom. Thanks very much. Hold on... Stop. Mr. Bentata, stop. He's going too fast. Where were we? The Islamists killed two of his friends. He fled by night. He arrived at a sort of camp in Algeria. Tell him to carry on but slowly. What was that? Basically, he's saying, "Ok." Basically, he agrees. The situation in the camp was disastrous. The toilet block was catastrophic. There was no water, hot or cold. I can't get hot water either, it's hell. Excuse me a minute. Madeleine... Can you come with me? Excuse me. You know Tunisia, right? Not really. I went to Djerba once. Why? I've never been. I'm totally lost. Can you help? It's for a very nice man, Mr. Bentata. We barely left the Club. Great! It's better than nothing. You know the country whereas I... But I'm busy. That's ok. Thanks. Hello. How's it going? Ok. So? I've asked around. You still have the OLFT. It's risky applying for residence for the next year. In the meantime, keep a low profile. Try to avoid ID checks, keep away from big stations... Airports, use crosswalks, pay my subway fare... It's ok, I know all that. What's the solution? Well... The solution is to file a new application. After how long? I told you, after a year. What do I do in the meantime? Avoid stations... You think I'm stupid? No, not at all. A period of transition can be good. Transition? Think I'll sit at home counting flies? Terrified of uniforms? Even mailmen freak me out! How do I live? How do I pay my rent? People count on me! Aren't you here to help? Stop yelling at me! I can get angry too! Think this is easy for me, all this hassle, these damn documents? Always one missing! Never a fixed address! Just tone it down, ok! Because I'm tired, ok! I'm tired! Shit, I never came looking for you! I'm sick of it! Ok? Fucking hell! Screw this! Screw it all! Fuck! What did she say? Basically, she's tired. I promise I'll keep away from stations. Why did you yell at me? It wasn't just me. You yelled too. Loudly as well. Are you mad at me? Good night, Alice. Good night, Simone. Come on... I said nothing about the macaroons. Good night, Alice. Good night, Odette. Good night, Odette. So? Are you mad at me? Sure? Sure. Thank you for everything you're doing. Thank you very much. I mean it. Thank you. I'll be going now. Thank you. Great, you get the whole distance thing. Shut your mouth. Cool, you're frank. Shut your mouth anyway. You don't look it but you're a real hottie! Hello. I'm looking for Gracieuse. Someone said she might be here. Yes, that's me. Actually, I'm looking for Gracieuse. I told you, I'm Gracieuse. It's you... I know Jonah. Ok, a plain manicure with a soak or a massage? 10, 20 or 30 minutes? Sorry. Are you sure you're Gracieuse? Of course I'm sure! But Magalie is a Gracieuse too. No! There are two called Gracieuse? Ok, so maybe I need... Can you call the other? Call her for me, please. She's more like the Gracieuse I'm after. Don't stop. He told me everything. How you met in Spain, the tomato greenhouses, even the trashcans... When'll he be out? No idea. Soon, I hope, but... I don't know. I'm glad to hear from him but two years is a long time. A lot has happened. You're still getting married? He said that? Yes. Aren't you? In any case, I like the hand massage. It's good because people use their hands a lot. Every day even. When they're tired, you massage them. When you work, massaging your hands makes them less tired. People massage backs but we use our hands, not our backs. I like to joke. - Good night. - See you, girls. What're you doing here? Actually... I had an appointment nearby. So I went to my appointment and... I was passing, it's on my way. Since it's my way... I can take you home. Ok. Where's your car? Well, walk you home. I don't have a car. I can carry you if you want. Where do you live? Just north of here. Ok, guys. Who's done security work before? You and you. The others can go home. You're back-up. 50 euros, hand to hand. Deal? Deal. Let's kit you out. What the hell? - What's up? - He fell. Sure. Put it back. He keeps falling. See? The stocks now. Stop falling, ok. He's broken. He's broken. That's why. I'll mend you later, ok. - Don't touch. - I didn't. He fell. He broke when he fell. - Love at first sight? - No, he fell. Guys! Down there, guys! Fuck! Keep still! Run, the cops are coming. Big guy, run! The cops are coming. Get lost! - Why? - Get lost, ok! I'm sorry... I didn't mean to wake you. I'm not much of a sleeper. They sure made a mess of you. I even like your perfume. Musk? I'm not wearing any. It's looking a bit better. How do you feel? I'm ok. I'll drive you home. I'm parked there. You don't want to talk? It's not that but... I feel like I'm going off the rails. I'm screwing up. It's not like me. You can't tell but I know about going off the rails. Actually, I can tell. - Really? - Yes. It's because of a woman. A woman? It began in the holding center. I crossed a line I should never have crossed. I see. Samba, let's clear up any misunderstandings. I like you very much too but I don't think I'm ready. So I'd like to preserve a little distance between us for now. Sure... But, actually... No, I... I don't mean you. Sorry... My friend Jonah sent me to see his girlfriend, Gracieuse and I had a massage and all and I crossed the line. All right... Sorry. I put it badly. But I like you a lot too. You're a woman who... Seatbelt. I really like you. I even like your perfume. Really, I like you a lot. Enough. But it's true. In ten years, I've had a lot of help. But you're really different. Different? Yes. You're not a law student, no piercings, you're under 85... Well, I think so. Thanks a lot. What happened to you? Why are you here with a guy like me at 3 am? You won't say? It must be serious then. I had a burn-out. A what? A burn-out. It happens when you work 12 hours a day with no recognition. Like a slave. What kind of job do you do? I worked... Well, I work for... a large hiring firm for the food-processing industry. It's been 15 years. In 15 years, I became someone else. I got caught in a spiral, meeting goals, advancing at any cost, under constant pressure. Little by little, I stopped sleeping at night. My life and my work got mixed up. I avoided everyone. No friends, no guy. And, overnight, I went overboard. I blew a fuse. There, I blew a fuse. Blew a fuse? But how? During a hiring session, a colleague tried to answer his phone as I was speaking... And? It's hard to say. You have to say it. I shattered his phone on his head. Not bad... I tore out some of his hair too. No! I bet that hurt. It seems so. He didn't answer his phone? After that, I had a stay in a clinic and discovered I wasn't alone in letting go like that. I followed a program. You paint watercolors, listen to music... You even pet horses now and then. Anything to hold on to. The charity work is part of your treatment? In a way, yes. Are you better now? I still pet horses now and then. See, you are different. There are side-effects. Such as? A sort of reaction. Excesses, abuse... It can be food, drink, sex... What's yours? Sex. When I let myself go, it's a massacre. Sex? Let yourself go... A massacre? What do you do with sex? I'm kidding. - Oh, right. - No, no excess. Ok. I can't say yes to excess. That's pretty. "Yes to excess." Yes, it's pretty. I'm moved. You're my first burnt-out friend. I'm pleased. I'm pleased you're pleased. Are you sure you were kidding when you talked about a massacre? It's not true? Maybe you do it a little, huh? - Shall we go? - Yes. What happened this time? You're hurt? - I'm talking to you! - My battery was dead. I saw a friend who had a burn-out. A burn-out? What are you talking about? Don't complicate things with a woman. It'll mean more trouble. Stop yelling. My head hurts and I'm tired. You're tired? So go sleep someplace else. This is my home, not some hotel. Want me to go? To leave? Ok, I'm going. You're rid of me, you'll get some peace. It's all over for me here! So go back. They're all waiting for you there. I'll have more room. Maybe I can finally find a woman. - Cut it out now. - Get off me! I'm making room here. For you and your woman! You want to be an empty-handed loser? You want to spend your time drinking? Want to be a failure? Here. Take it. Take it, it's for you. It's for you, ok. You can see it's not me. They don't care. If they did, would they find so many workers? It'll cause us problems. Here, take it. Listen, Samba... Take this card and find yourself work. It's not fake ID. I'm lending you mine. We can't go back like this. We'll go back as kings, like we said. Each with a house by the lake, side by side, with everything we need. Trust me. Take it. You were born in '56? I didn't know that. You're old! Give me that. If I'm old, give it back. - It's mine. - Give it back if I'm old. How's it going? Fine. Remember me? The Immigration line. You're confusing me with another guy. No, I'm not. Don't freak out. Relax. All these guys have fake ID. I have real ID. You're wrong. Great coat. Going hunting? Where's your rifle? Hello, ma'am. Hello, gentlemen. I need ten construction workers and a window-cleaning tandem. Sewing? No, no sewing work today. One, two, three... Hold on... four, five... six, seven, eight, nine and ten. That's it. Fill out the forms outside, please. Excuse me. I have all I need. And the windows? - You're from Mali? - Senegal. Mali or Senegal is good for construction but window-cleaning is risky and needs a permit. Tudo bem. I did tower block windows with him last month. That's right. Josiane... Por favor. Come on, be cool. No problema. He's a friend of mine. Your residence permit. Obrigado. Right, "obrigado". Lamouna Saw... That's me. Wake up! I think it's vertigo... Could've fooled me. Come on. Stand up. - I can't. - You can. Don't look down, look up. Look up, ok! Tranquilo. Easy! There. Deep breaths. That's right. Turn now. Turn. It's ok. Trust me. Now enjoy the view, my friend. Tudo bem. No one to piss us off here. Don't look down. I'm relaxed. I feel better. If you're relaxed, trabalho. We have ten floors to do. - Hey! - Relax, my friend. Tell me when you move it! It's dangerous! This is my floor. What's wrong? It's nothing. Seen this? Heaven on earth. Know the Coca Cola ad? What? The Coca Cola ad? Cut it out! C'mon, have some fun. You'll catch cold. Screw that, look at them. Move with me. She's my high. You're my high. Move with me. You're making it sway! It's ok. What're you doing? Cut the crap now! Where's your boss? No more Coca Cola! Back to work! Show's over. We're leaving. C'mon, move! Love you, girls! Just a second. Hello? Jonah? What's up? I couldn't reach you. I've done every salon around Barbs. No sign of her. What d'you mean, no sign? Maybe she changed jobs or maybe even left France. I can't find her. What are you talking about? I know she's in Paris. What do I do? I'm going crazy here! You're breaking up... Jonah? Shit! I've screwed up badly. Really badly. It's no big deal. You're a man. It happens. You didn't force her. How do I get out of this shit? The day I find a woman, I sure won't introduce her to you. Why d'you say that? I'm kidding! Come on. I like a joke but don't say that. I'm ashamed. Jonah asks me to find her and what do I do instead? It's not right. It's not funny. Horny goat! No, cut it out, I'm no horny goat. No goat. Relax, it's a party. I can't take this music. Where are the pequenas? You promised babes, not grannies. Trying to hook him up? Hold on... See her? She's for you. She's kind, she's sweet, very pleasant. She's your high. Tranquilo. Yeah, go for it. I have exams. - It's awkward. - You're right. You take it all so seriously. Tequila, princesa? We're talking. Tudo bem. Yeah, tudo bem. I'm not staying long. We can't just miss the boat. Miss the boat? There's a way not to. Great atmosphere, huh? Want a plate? Go on, have fun. She's coming over. Hello, Samba. Hello, Alice. Have a seat. Introduce me. Go on, introduce me. Aren't you dancing? I'm not into that. Hey, I'll dance! Cut it out. You're beautiful tonight. You're sure you mean me? I never know with you. No, I'm sure. I mean you. He means you. - Introduce me. - Take a walk. Thank you. You're welcome. You're looking much better. I slept five hours last night. Without pills. That's not bad. It's the cold water. My tank's on the blink. All those icy showers firm up the skin. The element, probably. In the water tank. Alice, this is Wilson, a friend. Hola, princesa. Portuguese? That's a sign. Come and dance. Come on, Samba. No, I don't dance. Go ahead. I'll look after your plate. - You're no fun. Come on. - No, really. I can't dance. Come on! He doesn't dance. I won't stay long. Your friend's a good dancer. He's overdoing it a bit. To my exams, in September at the earliest. To your exams. There's more! I want to stop being a shitty intern at 489 euros a month. Drink now, you boozers. To your exams. Who's next? Me. In Africa, on rainy evenings... Not the rainy evenings. Let him speak. It's nice but it's a long one. We're listening, Lamouna. So, in Africa, on rainy evenings, insects called mayflies swirl around and fall into our plates. They hit the walls and sometimes fall half-dead. They're unable to resist being attracted to the light. Their desire to live is too great. They buzz frantically around the bulb. In the morning, they're like tiny dead leaves on the table but were flying the night before. May none of us ever be one of those mayflies. Morgan Freeman cast a chill with his fly story. I prefer Brad Pitt? My turn. I want to attract the attention of a girl who's real pretty and I'll say it out loud. I'm shy, so here's two clues. She makes 489 euros a month... And second, she's an ace cigarette roller. Not me then. You stand no chance, pal. - Zilch. - We'll see. Yeah, sure. Go ahead, Samba. Well then, I say... a house by the lake with everything we need. The house by the lake! And everything they need. And you, Alice? Yes to excess. Very nice. Marcelle! "Fight the devil with that thing called love." Nice. Who said that? Guess. Buddha? I know. It was Jesus. No. Gandhi. I bet it was Gandhi. Paul-Jules Lambrin. Who's that? A cousin of mine. They're drunk. Not Paul-Jules Lambrin. Bob Marley. Now that's classy. At 100, Marcelle quotes Bob Marley. You cow! You'll pay for that! To Paul-Jules Lambrin! You know, you're a real gang of nutters. Sorry? I didn't say anything. I thought you said something. How are you doing? Alice, I just said... I wanted to know if you're ok. How's life? I'm doing better. I managed to lower the dose of pills again. That's good. But I still find it a bit hard to relax or feel things. But I'm doing better. I'm getting there. Here. Want to smash it and pull my hair? Good idea. Right now? Well? The tank's a bit old. Like I said, it's the element. I cleaned it. It should last a couple more years. Fantastic. I have hot water now? Every flavor. Cold, lukewarm, hot... It's running. Test it in 20 minutes. Thank you. What do I owe you? 300 for labor, 200 for travel costs, making 700 but 1,000 for you. - 1,000? - No, not 1,000. He's trying to be funny but he isn't. It's not funny at all. I thought he was useless at math. He won't ask you for 1,000. It'll be zero. Call it zero, ok. No problem. Sure, zero. Don't wind me up. - Zero's fine. - Zero's good. I'll be going. We'll be going. - Really? - We have to go. You don't have to leave. I have that math class to go to. I'm the same... I have a class too... Stuff to do... If you say so. Thanks, Alice. Thanks for the tea. - What's going on? - What? Stay with her. Are you scared or what? It's not that. But I've screwed up enough lately. Make the most of it. Go shower with her or I will. Stay here. Stop it. Stay right here. Wilson! Relax, Samba. Tranquilo. Shit... Hi, how's it going? Forgotten something? I just wanted to check up on you. Is everything ok? I'm fine. Do you feel anything? Not really. It's not great... I'm not saying it's no good but we could try here... Like this. All right. Well? That feels a bit better. But just a bit. - Want me to stop? - Not at all. Come on! You may as well carry on. How does that feel? Stop talking now... Shit, what's that? I don't believe it! It's fucking freezing! I don't believe it. Your Portuguese pal is a fucking genius! Fucking hell! Shit! Goddammit! Alice, are you upset? It's hot now. Shit, boiling hot! Feeling better? Just a little longer. What's she called? Daisy. I have to go. I'll be back in five minutes. No, it's ok. I'll treat you to a ride with Daisy. It's not me. It's the building's pipes. Sure, the pipes. Give me some slack! Are you sleeping? So what did you do? Mopped up as best we could. - And after? - We went to a park. We petted ponies. Ponies... Not at all. Missed the boat. But that's ok. We'll meet or call each other. Something's there. Sometimes she yells but we get along. I think the boat will be sailing in again. Let's split, Samba! Why? What's up? Come on! What is it? Come on! Where're you going? Wait for me! - Come on. - Wait for me! Shit! Ma'am! Ma'am, please! Can you open the window? We're stuck! Please, ma'am! Please, ma'am! Shoes off! Hurry. - Which way? - Down there. Hold these. What're you doing? Where're you going? Shit, Wilson, I can't do this! Come on. - I can't. - You can. No, Wilson, I can't. No way. Just forget it. Throw the shoes. What the hell? I threw them. To me, I said. No, you said, "Throw the shoes." It's different. We're in socks now! You never said, "Throw them to me." Teaching me French on a roof? Come off the roof. You're not coming? I can't climb out! Come on. You're fine. Come on! Don't pull at me! Don't pull. I'm coming. I'm coming. Calm down. - It's slippery. - It's not. Come on. - Are you nuts? - You slipped! You're going too fast! Calm down! Why are you always climbing stuff? We don't go any higher! This isn't funny, ok! What's that accent? Hold on. Count... On three? Three! It's ok. You wanna make out? - I don't want to make out! - Stand still! Tell me something... What's the capital of Brazil for you? Algiers. I thought so. My real name's Walid. I was born in Oran. Why Wilson? When I got to Paris, I had it tough. I met these great Brazilian guys. I soon realized, for work and chicks, it's easier for Brazilians. So I became Wilson. I'm moved. Why? You're my first mixed Arab-Brazilian friend. Keep your mouth shut, ok. Tudo bem. Cut it out! That's not funny! I'm wet now. You should've said, "Throw me the shoes." I get the message, ok. You need to be more precise. You live here? Who gave you the code? - Hello, Mr. Laprade. - Hello, Wilson. You're a day late. I'm sorry, I had to work. It's the same problem with my dishwasher but it's not the element. - Not the element? - No. I'm surprised. The sink and U-bend are ok? No, nothing's right. I'm counting on you. And try wearing shoes. Your uncle? Still no reply. It sucks. I bet it's the police. He can say his ID was stolen. They'll let him go. I knew it meant trouble. But, you know, he... I was so scared! Let's be more traditional. Traditional is good too. For you. Thank you. That's all I found in your size. They were my ex's. An ex with tassels on his shoes can't have helped the burn-out. Sorry about the element. I'll come back to mend it for you. No, it's ok, I'll manage. Brazilian plumbing... What can I make you to apologize? Tea? Coffee? I'll see to it. Let's get some water. - What's your game? - You sly devil. You have secrets. Don't say that. What about this? My slippers! Not so loud. From Rio or So Paulo? Walid, what do we say? Cut it out. Keep quiet! I think I get your "distance" thing. I love South Americans. I noticed. Keep it to yourself. It could look bad with the girls. - Keep your mouth shut. - It's shut. What kind of tea? Oriental style! With foam and pine kernels! Don't blow my cover! Don't stay in the kitchen. Come to the living room. He's so funny! They're off again. We can't stay while they make a baby. Maybe even twins. I thought the same thing. Twins because they're going for it. Shall we go? Yes. Excuse me... I'll call you. Good night. You have a great sense of humor. I wanted to tell you... My sick leave's nearly over so I'm going back to work. That's good news. I'm glad. It's good. You know, I don't get carried away like she does but I was scared for you too. That hadn't happened for a long time. It happens to me a lot. And laughing too. That hadn't happened for a while. Nothing's happened for a while now. So thank you for all that. And also... I think I feel good when I'm with you. That's good news too. You're better. Two bits of good news the same day. That's good. - Well? - Come on. They took me from the restaurant in front of everyone. The boss said not to come back on Monday. I'm coming. We'll find a way. I'll find a way. That's him. Follow me. He says follow him. Next time, don't be late, ok! Wait right here for me. He said to wait here. He's not speaking Brazilian. That was French. I understand him. Hurry. This is the lot. How much is this one? Which one? With the mustache. Modibo Diallo. 1,000 for me? Blacks are cheaper. Even so, 1,000... Don't start. Hold on. Look... We'll give you these loafers too. They're real leather, designer ones. Calfskin with tassels and the works. - Deal? - Is he serious? I'm not here for fun. Size 8. 9 with an insole. - Two for 1,000. - Chinese is cheaper. You can look Chinese. - No problem. - Two for 1,000. Look here, Wang Lee. Look, your spitting image. - Cut it out! - It's true. Brazilian or Chinese. Shit! Do us a deal. Get lost! What did I do? - Wang Lee? - What? - You answered. - Cut it out! Quit messing up my head! Hold on. We'll take Wang Lee and the mustache. What's your problem? Chill. Take the tassels and we take the mustache with Wang Lee. We need them! Diallo! Modibo Diallo! That's me. Come with me. We'll put you on sorting. Sala, this is Modibo. Sala will train you on the sorting belt. Show him how, Sala. See you later. I got your message. What's this appointment? It's my first day back. It had to happen. I have a sort of mental block. I've been standing here two hours. I like your look. The jacket and briefcase... Working girl. It suits you. Thank you. We mention the mustache? No, don't bother. I brought this. For me? Thank you. It's proved its worth. It'll help you. I try it on now? No, not with people around. Later. Thank you. Right, I'll be going. Traditional or untraditional? Untraditional? It's ok. Take that with you. It'll work. Ok, thank you. Goodbye. Good luck. You don't say it like that. Not like that... Why did you say that? Traditional or untraditional... I'm so stupid... I just got "untraditional". And? No. Well, yes... Yes, to untraditional, between traditional and untraditional. Even with the mustache. When we last saw each other I... Unless I misunderstood you? It prickles a bit. That's a traditional kiss which is untraditional. Hold on. What's that? What's that photo of me? How did it get here? Actually, it was in your file and I couldn't help myself. I felt something each time I looked at it. I think you're cute with your hair like that. You've been interested in me a while? We're playing "truth or dare", that's the idea? That's the idea... You... You're kind of different. Different is good. Modibo Diallo... How do you all keep changing names? What can I do with this? I don't know. There's no kitchen work? I'm nearly a qualified chef. I can't take the smell at the sorting center. You can never wash it off. Josiane, please... Please. Por favor. Seen how your card's cut? Maybe you paid a lot but it's a useless scan. Here. It's worthless. It's a wonder it worked. Come back with a real residence permit. I'll see what I can do. Gentlemen, good morning. I need a painter, two tilers and a form setter! I know you. Get in. Let him through. Form setter... Two tilers. Two here! Ok, close the door. I don't need anyone else. Why did you shave the mustache? It made you look like Borat. I made you a gratin. It's in the oven. Call your friend who works near the Opera. Maybe they need someone there. I'm off. I'm going out. I won't be back late. The depressive again? Don't call her that. You're so naive. Once she's better, she'll forget you. You'll suffer. You're wasting time. What can you offer her? What can you give a woman? Can't I decide for myself for once? You always make the decisions but how do you know what's right for me? I just want to be with her! I prefer her scent to this stink! What if I want to believe in it? If it works out, that would hurt you, huh? That's the problem. It would hurt you! Make sure she takes her pills. You're hard to find, brother. You never answer. It's good to see you. I want to celebrate. Come for a drink? Not now. I have to meet someone. I'm expected, it's complicated. Just a quick drink... Come on, I'm happy to see you. - Just one then. - No more. What are we celebrating? Political refugee. I'm good for 10 years with this. That's good. Really good. I'm happy for you. I haven't found Gracieuse. She must have left France like you said. Maybe. I think so. Maybe she left France. Smoke outside! Outside. Don't snap at me... I'm going, Jonah, or I'll be late. You can't leave now. We just met up again. - Let's walk. - I can't. I can't. I have to go. And I'm cold too. You're cold? Hold on a second. I drank so much I can't feel the cold. Give me your jacket. You're not very talkative. Nothing to tell me? Think I'm an asshole? Think I'm an asshole? - Do you? - Calm down, you're drunk. Saving me at the center doesn't let you fuck my woman! Cut it out. - Stop it. - Was it good? Was it good? Let go of me! Let go! You don't answer my calls? Calm down! You just got papers! Let go of me! Shit, Jonah, the cops! So what, I've got papers. What's going on? Bastard! Stop! His body was in the canal. What? How? They called me in the night. I don't know what happened. I just don't know. I can't stay. Why not? I have to go home. I'll explain. I can't... I'll go ahead. I can't keep this. Excuse me. You forgot this. I can't take it. I can't. What difference does it make now? Don't you deserve it? Take it. For your sake, not mine. I don't know my own name anymore. I'm afraid I might forget who I am one day. I won't forget. If you forget one day, just shout your name. People will think you want to dance. I'm sure it will go well. Hello, Alice. You know a few people... Have a good meeting. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Who did the menus? I did. Why? "Zander steak in a spelt crust with crushed earth apples." What is that exactly? Breaded fish and mash. Ah, ok. We'll put that instead. Ok. It'll be clearer. You're the new chef? Yes, I am. - What's your name again? - Me? - My name? - Yes.
