It was found in a refuse sacks that floated ashore on Stora Amundn. Stridner in Forensic Medicine is handling it. From the little I could see was that it was cut here - - and here and here. - So it was a torso? - Yes. - I talked to Stridner on the way here. All the internal organs are missing. - Did she say anything about when she'll be ready? - Tomorrow. - Hi. Sorry for being late. - It's alright. Yes, Frederick, you were saying something. I did an analysis of the weather to track the torso's route. - To do what? - Can't you help me with the monitor? The torso should have ended up here - - that requires both strong sea and wind, we had a storm two weeks ago. So the bag was dumped in 14 days ago? Yes, according to Stridner. As you can see we had the gale to the northeast and flows... Finely drawn. You could be a meteorologist. I'm not a meteorologist making animations... Shut it! Continue. If we assume that the torso was dumped from a place - - that's easily reached by car, a pier or a bridge - - I have found 14 possible sites. It could have been dumped anywhere. From a rock or a boat. Yes, certainly. But if you just throw out body parts from a cliff - - there's a high risk that they'll wash up. Let's just assume that it was thrown from a fixed location. If we do that, we have these 14 possible sites - - and not thousands of locations from a boat. - If anyone wants to see the calculations... - Save it 'til Christmas. So there are probably only Birgitta? It will be your task. Jonny, go back to Amundn and search further there. Irene. You're sticking to Stridner and try to get her to finish faster. Thank you. Professor Stridner is not ready yet. She said not before tomorrow? Yes, but I thought she might have some leads to give us. Come then, so we will see how angry she gets. Just so you know, I am far from finished. Each tatoo? Here. - I will send someone to take a picture. - No, don't run more than necessary. Martinsson, you can draw it? Yes, I just go down to the lab with these first. As I said, I am far from finished. There are some contradictory findings. Legs, arms and head are cut with a standard circular saw. But for the interior cavity it is much more precise. Can there be two perpetrators? Look at this handsome incision from the sternum to the pubic bone. As you can see it has not cut through the navel, but around - - as in an autopsy. So it could be a PATHOLOGIST? - All these hasty conclusions. It can be a hunter or someone who read about it. No. Not this one. No. Taste. More cayenne. It should add more bite to the sauce. Hey, darling! Taste. Delicious. Only a bit too much cayenne. Cool...! - Can you cope without me? - No! Good, then outta the way. Good! - was that really good? - damn goof. Perhaps a little too good for the neighbors. - After you exercise, make sure that gate is...? - Closed, yes. But you know what. We have a job in Bors at the Wharf House. - What fun. - We'll stay at the hotel and everything. - Great. - It is a good idea then? Ok, go in and I'll make dinner. - What do you mean? - Stay at the hotel and everything. Mom...! I'm already 16 years old. Yes... exactly. Hello, darling! Hello. Shall we get out and go? But Monika, hi. - God, you scared me. - Sorry, I didn't mean to. It was long ago. How are you? It is something I want to talk to you about. - Isabelle's disappeared. - Disappeared? What do you say? I don't know what to do. The police said they cannot do anything. Wait. Try to take it from the beginning. She won a beauty contest in the summer. After that, she only talked about becoming a model. Go to London. Isn't she in high school? She left after she came in contact with Absolute Models. A model agency in Copenhagen. They'd pay for the trip, everything started so well at the beginning. But now I haven't heard from her in over four weeks. Isn't she just busy? You know how they are at that age. - Well she forgets to call home. - But I went there last week. Her address doesn't exist and Absolute Models has gone bankrupt. Do you have a picture of her? It is outside my area, but I'm going to call the Danish police. Have you found any cases reminiscent of our torso? Finland and Norway have homicides too, but nothing like this... - And the Danes? - We are awaiting for their response. Does the pathologist know if it's a man or woman? She'll report in the morning, when she's finished. But here is the drawing of the tattoo that her assistant did. Unbelievable. A pathologist who hasn't needed days and years on it. The sign in the middle is Japanese. It stands for "husband". If the torso is a man it is a gay, we are dealing with. - Here we call them "homosexual". - They call themselves gay after all. Cut it out, otherwise I'll report you. Yikes, what stinks in here. - Why are we not using the conference room? - Fools, it's no smoking. You apologize, but I don't have all the time in the world. We are dealing with something as unusual as a sadistic necrophile. One that doesn't cut up victims to get rid of them. Cutting is the point. All internal organs removed. Unnecessary if you just want to get rid of the body. In addition, the body has been violated by removing the breasts, genitals, and rectal opening. Then he crushed the pubic bone. - Nice guy...! - But it was a man? Yes, it was a man, which is unusual. Usually, the men - cut women. Usually prostitutes, they're the easiest to obtain. We can see if someone recognizes the tattoo. These murderers have some common features. They are friendly and courteous, but lack the ability for deeper friendship. - Their sex life is often odd... - I told you it was a gay. He might as well be straight, transvestite or pedophile. What they have in common is that they seek something sexual. They are often impotent, and may only climax when they cut a dead body. - So you think he will kill again? - If he has not done so already. No, I can't stand the smell of smoke. We'll go to the conference room. That won't upset you, Andersson? - Why do you sit out here? - Fresh air. Here is a fax for you from Denmark. Did they find something? A Carmen stergaard was murdered last summer. She was also inviscerated. Carmen? It sounds like a slut. Yes, she was a prostitute and floated ashore in various refuse sacks at Kastrup. - Are there similarities with our case? - Yes. But I need the full autopsy report. Can I check something? Yes! What luck, she is scanned. - Who? - Carmen. Or her body parts. The address of the server and the password are here. So we just have to check. - NWhen will we see the film. - I would like to see the report. Can you...? Okay, zoom in. - The same autopsy incisions. - Can we open up and look in? Continue down to the pubic bone. And turn it reverse 180 degrees and then back again. Thank you, it's enough. Yes, there is no doubt that it's the same perpetrator. Irene, what do you say to a quick trip to Copenhagen? - Shall I take your bag? - No, it is not necessary. It is not about what is needed. - What's your name again? - Peter Mller. How long have you worked in Crime? ten years, but I'm still childishly fond of my work. - Are you a hunter? - Yes, I am. I am going to Sweden to shoot deer soon. If we find any. I'll pick you up at the hotel in an hour. Then you'll have time to check in and freshen up. - Irene Huss. - I am. I just spoke with Jens Metz, who provided the data on Carmen. Yes? According to him, there was a police trace which led to their own police force. - What were they up to? - I don't know. The investigation was completed. - I thought you should know that. Yes, great. Thank you. Do you know who led the investigation? Peter Mller. He's still working so you'll be able to see him. Ok, thanks. Jens Metz. You must be Irene Huss. - I thought Peter would come. - Unfortunately, he couldn't come. Your colleague Fredrik faxed a drawing of the tatoo to me. I think I know where it came from. If you want I can show you instead. If you want. - Sure. - It is not too far from here. I started working for so doing some months ago. Moved here from Aarhus. So you weren't here when Carmen stergaard was found? No, that was why it took some time to dig up material on her. Hello. Irene Huss, Swedish police. I would like to ask you some questions. Ok. Keep an eye on the enemy in your vicinity. Do you? The first backpack with Carmen's torso was found in Hellerup on August 4. Three days later the limbs floated ashore. - And the head? - The head was never found. The police investigation - what started it? It concerned street prostitutes. We interrogated the whole Vesterbro. But these two shared the street corner with Carmen. They stood next to her. They said Carmen agreed to meet a policeman - even though she thought he was creepy. She said - - either the doctor or the police officer would be her death. - Was there a medical record too? - Yes, yes. - Who is Peter talking to? - Svend Blokker, one of our forsenic scientists. Do you know if they met with the doctor or the police officer? Yes, but only one. Anne spoke about a doctor and Kristine about a police officer. - I want copies of the investigation. - Of course. It is right there. Well, Jens, a completely different thing... Do you know the Absolute Models? - A model agency. - Sure it is a model agency? No, I suspect that there is something else. A friend daughter got a job there and now she's disappeared. That is how they are lured here. The dream of becoming a model. When they find out what they must do it's too late. I will see what I can find out about her. Thanks, really nice. Her name is Isabelle Lind. Is it hard reading? - Have you been introduced? - Hi. Svend Blokker. Pathologist here. I dissected Carmen. Peter said you have a similar case. Yes, it's the same perpetrator. Or men. - Are you aware of Absolute Models? - that is a totally private matter. - Who is it? - Isabelle Lind. - Daughter of one of Irene's girlfriends. - She came here, now she's gone missing. I promised her mother I'd see what I could do. No, I do not know Absolute Models. - But Svend...? Unfortunately. But I know an excellent French restaurant - if you got the time and desire. Sure. - So you headed the investigation of Carmen? - Yes. Wasn't it difficult to close it? The case was never resolved. No. When one has followed up all the leads - - there is not much more to do. Wasn't there? There is always something to follow up? Yes, of course. But it's the same with everything. It is a matter of priority of how we can do the most good. Cheers. But it was you who took the decision to close the investigation? I am a detective, just like you. My job is to solve cases, not close them down. Sorry. There, you must agree with... The subtle thigh here, huh? I think frog legs. Isabelle... Is she someone you know personally? She was in my daughter's class. - So you have children? - Two girls. - In my adolescence. - When is this entirely a holiday. Yes, it can be said. - Hurrah for a vacation. - Cheers. Is it ok with your husband that you go on holiday? I am, as they say, happily married. Yes... Excuse me. Good evening. Come at 23. Use the back door. Very important! Tom Tanaka - Was it the happy man? Vacation is final in all cases. I thought we were going on. Shall we not? I'll do that. So, you can ask another time. I don't recognize her. Hello. Irene Huss, Swedish police. I'm looking for Isabelle. We have no Bell here. Well then, give. Take me to Isabelle or I'll take you home to her parents. You aren't a day over 18. Right? What the hell are you doing? she could be your own daughter! You bother me. Am I interrupting something? You should be ashamed! You bother me, I say. Drop the knife! Drop the knife, I say! And you get out of here. Bugger! Police Pig. Isabelle... Do you recognize me? Irene. Jenny and Katti's mother. Isabelle... Why are you doing here? I am here on work, but I promised your mother to try to find you. She is very worried about you. I don't know what problems you have, but you can't solve them here. Isabelle, follow me home. Home? What the hell am I to do there? Moreover, my boyfriend will be angry. You mean pimp? You should probably go now. I am here until noon tomorrow. What are you doing now? You should go. Hi, Monika. It is Irene. I have somebody here who wants to talk to you. Mom? Mom, it's me - Isabelle. - Irene Huss. - Peter Mller. Did I wake you? No, no problem. I wanted to say thanks for yesterday I want to offer you a ride to Kastrup. Damn! - Was it a good hotel? - Yeah, great. You look a little tired. Was it a hard night? - Irene Huss. - Hello? It is Petra from Pleasure Lounge. - I sat in the reception. - Right. Hello. Bell gave me your card. She joined a customer at the Aurora Hotel. Simon Steiner or something like that. But she hasn't come back. - Hello, are you there? I'm on my way to the plane. - We can chat later. - Do you know if something happened to her. Yes, when we say so. Bye. Is something wrong? No. Irene! What the hell's going on? Hello. I'm from the Swedish police. I'm looking for... this girl. She should have arrived last night and stayed with a guest. Simon Steiner. No, we have any Steiner here. Do you service all the rooms every day? - No, only those that were used. What rooms didn't you clean today? Yes... Approximately twenty. - Then can I search them. - It may not be possible. - We can't let just anyone in. - I'm not anyone. - I'm the police. - No, you're Swedish police. Okay, so can I check-in. Just so you know: you must pay in advance. Of course. But then I want to see the room first. - Appeared to your taste? - No, I want to see another. Here are the pass keys and our vacancies. - Hope you find something. - Thanks, I hope so too. - Irene Huss. - Where are you? - In Copenhagen. - Jonny will pick you up. Tell him he's not needed. I missed the plane. Missed the plane? It's catching up to you now? - Oh, sorry. - You can say that to Jonny. I know, I should have called, but... Well, anyway... the torso. I think I have a name there. His name was Marcus Tosscander and worked as a designer in Gothenburg. How did you get it? I got a tip from a source wanted to remain anonymous. I promised it. Yes... Irene? Irene? Are you still there? Irene? According to Svend it is the same perpetrator. There are many similarities between murders of Carmen and Marcus. - The approach is the same. - But why would he... I do not understand. He must be wrong. I want to talk to him. - I want to talk with Svend. - Yes. Wait a minute. Please. Irene... It is best that you go home. Go home now so we will arrange this. Ok? Come on. Who is that? - Is it the mother? - Yes. Does she know about? - Yes. Should I talk to her? - No, I will. Are you sure? Ok. What had Isabelle in common with Marcus Telander? Tosscander. Exactly what I'm considering. If it is as Danish police claim there must be something in common. You are the connection. You were in Copenhagen in connection with the second murder. - Yes, but... - What if you were closer than you think. What if you met the killer without your knowledge. But... You see far too many detective stories on TV. Finally something other than an expense claim. THE LILLE MERMAID IS DEATH - Irene, you can throw it in the waste basket. - Why? It is a warning addressed to you. It cost a young girl's life. Yes. I must live with it. But then, I was indeed very close to something. It is about your safety. What can happen then! He doesn't stop murdering, so I drop out. I can never give life back to Isabelle, but I can catch her killer. I know I can. You know it too. What are you going to do next? I want to go back to Copenhagen and look for Emil. To start with. He knew I was looking for Isabelle. He who found her for me. Ok. But, Irene... You are on this case together with Jonny. Jonny? You don't think I'd let you go back alone? You are my responsibility and too good a police officer to lose. The menu's only written foreign languages. It is in Danish, French, English, German. Yes, that's what I say. I can recommend this. Frogs' legs. Tell me what happened last. What you discovered and if you suspected someone. And if so, why. There is both a doctor and policeman in the investigation of Carmen. Marcus Tosscander also talked about them. The doctor is certainly Swedish. - But the policeman may be Danish. - Is there someone special you have in mind? - Peter Mller. - Do we have to work with him. It is just a feeling. But I think we should be a little cautious. What was his name... Emil? How did you get him? I can't go into it. Secret contacts? This job is team work. Then you just can't run around on your own. Do you? Shouldn't you take it a little easy? We are here to work. - What do you mean? - It is not a soft drink you're drinking. If we'ew going to be a team it is better if you're sober. Do not sit there and it was somebody's fucking mom. There is only one thing you must understand - - before we move on. Just because you trust me does not mean automatically that I trust you. Of course not. It would be extremely naive of you. But as long as we have the same goal, to punish the killer - - I'll help you. The young man who found Isabelle... - What's his name more than Emil? - Bentsen. Emil Bentsen. He has been my assistant for almost two years now. He receives a modest salary so he must like to be here. He has a great apartment in the town center. He rents rooms there. - Do you know the address? - Gothersgade 12. What the hell do you want? I would like to talk to Emil Bentsen. - Do you have his address? - If you're tired I'll go by myself. Wait in the lobby. - It's him. - Who? - Peter Mller. - Fucking hell! Fucking Danish bastard! Stop! - Can I guess? Emil Bentsen? - No. - Who the hell are you then? - Yes, who the hell are you? - This is my colleague Jonny Blom. - What good, I thought you were asleep. - What are you doing here? - The question is what are you doing here? Your Swedish colleagues are combing through Tosscanders apartment in Gothenburg now. Half an hour ago we found Emil's address on his computer. Marcus lived with Emil here? Yes. - Why didn't they tell us? - Perhaps they did. They might have got through if you had your cell phone on. Jonny, you then? - Yes, we go in? - There is nobody home. Idiot! Maybe we can get a search warrant tomorrow. Weak suspicions don't help here. - Not in Sweden either. Come. - But now we are not in Sweden. We divide ourselves up and check the rooms. Will you take the longer list?. If you take... Irena! I believe we have found your policeman. - So Emil was the policeman? - There is a possibility. It could also have been me. Or one of my colleagues. If Emil was the policeman so, the doctor must have murder him. And why? Perhaps Emil had a bad conscience and wanted to go to the police. - The real police. - Yes, yes, yes. If the reason now was to shut him up - - why would he cut him up and inviscerate him? Maybe he just couldn't resist. Then Emil was dead, he was so fixated on the body that he had to cut it up. - Not only that. See here. - Semen? Most are old, but there are some new that he tried to wipe away. So when he cut ready he had small batch. Holy shit...! Irene! It was probably these cassettes he was looking for. Good hiding place, huh? - What, it is with them? - "Hannibal Holocaust". It is 83 minutes long. This is a 240-minute film. Feel the weight. We will take copies home with us. While you were in Copenhagen we went through Marcus' apartment. What a waste. That he was gay or that he is dead? - We found this on his fridge. - Who is that kissing him? We do not know. It may well be his boyfriend. - It may be the culprit. - Right. He had it on with his own killer. Shit. If no one else has anything to do, I have Danish films to check. Jonny? Wait, sit down again. We even found this at Marcus flat. A membership - - in a sauna club in our town. They met frequently there. We just have to go through the Member registry. Think about it. Jonny? That kind of club has no membership register. Nah. How did you intend... No, you can't mean that... Damn it. But damn, you don't give a shit! You can go to hell! Hey, little girl. "Hi mom, great that you are home. " - What was wrong with her? - I think she was pissed. She is absolutely right. I don't give a shit. No, no, no, do not touch. - Wash your hands first. A glass of wine? - Mm. - Hi. - Hi. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cool! - Rilla's dad fixed them free of charge. - This job will be our break. - It gives us hope. Then you can get advice for rehearsal. - When is the concert? - It's on. - Is it already Friday? - Yes. - Kattis, baby, can you give me the salt? - No. How will you do after the concert then? What? Shall we go or will some other parents pick them up? We will sleep at the hotel. That is what is arranged. - Is it ok or what? - No. You may have thought so, but we have not said yes. But what? You have given of course. Right, Dad? Can't we go there all together, - - see Jenny's major breakthrough and then go home the next day? But hey. Understand how embarrassing it would be. - Can you stop saying "but hey"? - Hey! You just don't give a damn Hey. Thanks. Jonny, you look so fresh. Was is nice to take a sauna yesterday? Nicer than what we shall see. That is one of the worst I have seen. - Why do we have to look at it? - I may have missed something. Let's go on. I think the "doctor" is on the camera. The woman on the table is Carmen stergaard. She is dead and inviscerated. We do not know far it has gone to. Here, we see only cutting and it is Emil's show. - Can you turn on the sound? - There is no recorded sound. They correct that error in the next film. Here comes the next error. See? He obscures himself cutting with his own body. A mistake that they also fix in the next film? Hell, what a job you have. Forced to watch this. - Do you know where it is? - No. But it may be near an Airport. Wait a minute... There, in the window. See? - Is it a plane? - Zoom in a bit. - I do not know how. - Here. - Sure, and it is on the way up. - Is the green engine? Is it in both, so it is a Eurojet. But they do not fly to Sweden, only to Kastrup. Can we locate the runway, then we can identify the district below. You are good. Are you ready for the next film? Marcus... No, damn it hell! What a sick bastard. I do not know how about you, but I need a break. The case probably fuck all. See you in five minutes. Have you any idea where it can be? I do not know. Here precisely made windows will not even help. It looks like some kind of cellar. Isn't it a boat? - Look at that. There are some fenders. - That may well be the ladders? - In that case, it is no small boat. - Shh, wait... Can you screw up? - Do you hear? - What? - Listen, then! - It's a warning signal. No, a bridge opening. The 14 dumping sites you had... Seven of them are too small for such a big ship. Five of the other ports have no bridge that can be opened. So the remaining...? Trarnas Kai. Birgitta, it's pitch black here! Fredrik? Take it. It is Marcus. The whole block is full. He is pretty good. He did this yesterday. Look here. - Irene! - Fuck me, take him instead! Stop, I shoot! Stop! Damn! - Come, Irene, I'll drive you home. - But... Stop playing the hero now. We are worn out for today. Bye. No grouppies in your hotel room. Kiss, bye. - Good luck with the concert! - Yes. Hello. -Oh dear, you look like you need a good glass of wine. The ship's owner lived in Australia four years. He had no idea that someone had moved in there. God, how sweet it is! It gets better if you let it aerate for a while. - What did I do without you? - Were you drinking less wine. Please don't answer. It has been so long ago since we had a moment together. Irene...! - Irene Huss. - My name is Henning Oppdahl. I'm a head bouncer at Sahlgrenska. I spoke to a very heterosexual colleague of yours - - last night at the sauna club. It must have been Jonny Blom. Yes, maybe so. But now, it is you and me talking. Well... I think I met the killer you are seeking. Last fall I had a date with a guy from the club. - What was his name? - Basta. Do not ask me what he really was called, but we were out dancing - and had a good time and I asked if he wanted to come back with me. But he wanted to take me someplace else. Where was that? He wouldn't say at first, but it turned out to be a cemetery. It felt really uncomfortable. Normally, I am never afraid. At the same time, I was so... I open to most things, but necrophilia... - What did you do? - I beat it. I am good at running. It was probably lucky for you. You do not know which department he worked in? I think it was the Forensic Medecine. Forensic Medecine? Yes. Thank you. You've been a huge help. - What is he working here? - But... Where is your assistant? He drew the tattoo. - Sebastian Martinsson? - There he is. He is our culprit. He calls himself Basta and he is the person we're looking for. - Where is he now? Is he working? - No, he works only half-time. He is in Copenhagen studying art. Kryerakademin. We will go down and get some beer. Will you come later? - Yes, in a moment. - Ok, see you later then. How good you were. This is a small gift from me. No thanks, it is good. Good. You should keep yourselves off drugs as long as you can. It is the best advice I can give you. It is more rock'n 'roll to be sober than off your head drunk. You... How about accompanying me to the office? Hey, I do not think so. I have many contacts in this industry. - It would be good for you. - I do not want to. - Do you not? - No. But what if I really want to? - Maybe I want you. - I just want to only up in my hotel room. - Stop playing difficult now. - No! Stop! And who the hell are you? That's exactly who I am. God, what luck that you came. He was so fucking nasty. Congratulations on a great concert. Thank you. - I actually thought so. - Can I have your autograph? Do you want my autograph? Ok. What should I write then? - On the stomach? - Mm. Ok. - Do you not see how it looks? - No. - Why doesn't she answer? - They play a lot of encores. It's past 24:00. How many times have you called? I want her to know I'm going to Copenhagen tomorrow. - I will have gone when she comes home. - Then send an text message. It is something we may get used, whether we like it or not. Now we know at least where she is. Are you not worried? How can you be so calm? Krister... Oh, God! - He is on his way to Copenhagen. - Wait a bit. - I send Fredrik and Jonny. - What should I do? Sit here and wait for my daughter til various body parts will float ashore? We can fix this! We can arrange this. We must meet. Not now. Your colleagues have begun to monitor me. - Moreover, I am busy. - But, Tom, I know who he is. I know what he looks like, I know his name. And I think that he is here with my daughter. Are you alone? Nobody knows that I'm here. Not even my husband. You are the only one who can help me. So you depend on me now? Have I any choice? We try to limit the number of possible workshop premises in Kastrup. But we are still talking about more than 50 locations. Has he no other links here? He studied art at someplace called Kryerakademin. - Didn't I say? - No. It is Frederick. Ok, good. - It was Jonny. Irene is on the road. Yep. - She went to the gay shop with the drag icon. Tom Tanaka. I suspected that he had a hand in the game. So is he her secret source? Kryerakademin hire three of the premises on our list. Here, here and there. Should I not go in and get her right away? No, wait until she comes out. She or an Asian in pajamas. An Asian in pajamas? ...quiet as the grave. Nobody Irene and no ping- pong old guy. What... Bye. Good. - They've located the workshop. It is there. Away you go! I do not know. In the airport, I think. Move! It that fucking container there... - Get an ambulance quick. - We'll get an ambulance too. I have no idea how long... It stops here. Damn... Come and look. Come now. But this is... - Hello? - Mom? It is you? I am. - Jenny, where are you? - I do not know. I remember nothing. Jenny! Mom! I have here a Danish autopsy - Report on Sebastian Martinsson. It's the second time he will be autopsied. He was murdered in exactly the same way that he violated his victims. With one difference: he was alive when the organs were removed. He probably was forced to watch while he was disembowled. It means that someone knew exactly how the earlier killings took place. Someone who rescued Jenny, who just remembers that she woke up on a bench - and then called you. This one could be Tom Tanaka. We have no witnesses and only circumstantial evidence pointing to him. But the problem is - - that Tanaka claims that you and he were together all day. - Is it true, Irene? - Yes, exactly. You are sure he never left the room? Yes. Well... Then I'll call the Danes - and say you support his alibi. Can I do that? Yeah, right, Jonny... - If you fill out this application on... - Work Injury? Why? It is rumored that you took a dip by Trarnas Kai. - Did you find the Palme-gun there too? - What? Damn, great fun you were there...!
