[laughs] -...and "Hi" to Christopher Williams from Dublin Center. He's a regular listener to the program, and he texted me a while ago, and he said, "Any chance you might play a piece of music "which Mary Coogan used as the signature tune to the Golden Era TV show?" And tell me where... Check out the 50th anniversary-- - Is this what you used to listen to? - Yeah, of course, religiously. - [laughs] - Come on, kids! [bell ringing faintly] Get to class. No running. Take it easy. - That's where I went to school. - Ah, bare feet and a slate and a piece of chalk? - Yeah. Made a man out of me. [giggling] - Yeah, right. Do you think we'll get broadband? - Yeah, I hope so. - [laughs] - It needs a bit of work all right, hmm? - A bit? - We got time. There's loads of room to extend. Hey, come on. Come see the outhouse. Make a perfect studio for you. I told you you'd love it. What do you think? Shay's done a good job. Do you like this color? - Oh, my God. Look at the view. - This was mine. - It's perfect. We love it. - Yeah. It will be. - I love you. - I love you. - Oh. - What? - Funny. - This used to be mine and Cat's. Thought I'd fix it up for our Bartholomew. Ignatius? All right, then, Daniel. Come on, Daniel Conroy. - Oh, I thought we were getting everything new this time. - It'll be good as new, I promise. [hammer scraping] [chimes ringing] [gravel crunching] [car horn honking] - Hi. - Hi. I can't believe you're here. Oh, it's so great to have you home. - Hi, Shay. - Hey, how are you? - Hello, Eva. - Say hello to your Auntie Martha, Eva. - Hi. - Oh, my God. - Wow. - You two don't waste any time, do you? - Hey. - Ah, it's lovely. What's this? - It's Marty's. I love it. - I think it might be a bit dark for here, though. - Don't ask us. Our walls are covered in finger paintings. [tapping at window] - [screams] - Play with me. Play with me! [cans clanking] - [chuckles] Hello. Were you just banging on my window? I'm Martha. What's your name? - Daisy. - Hello, Daisy. - [screams] - Away with you. - Stop it! - Get away from here. Stay away from here. - What are you doing? Are you okay? Did he hit you? Daisy? [school bell rings] - Good morning, all. all: Morning, sir. - I'm Tomas Conroy. You can call me "Tomas." You can call me "Mr. Conroy." Just don't call me "Sir." [video game bleeping] - Are you married to Tomas Conroy? - Yes. Do you know him? - I heard he was teaching at his old school. - English. - We used to sit together at the back of the school bus. I'm Orla Gannon, by the way. - Martha. - And that's Lucy. Are you sure you're not gonna go crazy here after the bright lights of London? - I went crazy in London. That's why we're here. - Great. That's all perfectly normal. Why don't you take a seat? Anything in your family history I should know about? - My mother died of cancer when I was four. - You're young and healthy. There's nothing to worry about. - I have another baby. Chloe. Sorry, um... She died when she was three weeks old, sudden infant death syndrome. - Well, that wasn't your fault, pet. When did it happen? - Two years ago. - I'm going to take really good care of you. Okay? - Evening. - Shay said he'd help me put a skylight in and a window. - You never mentioned Orla. - Orla? - Orla from the school bus. - Yeah, she broke my heart when I was 19. That's when I came looking for you. - Hello! [baby crying] - Jack, Jack. No, don't be like that. - Let's get you in. - [whispering] Daisy. [sighs] Move away. - [giggling] [melancholy piano music]  - Jack! Jack! Jack! No! Jack! [wails] No! - Oh, God. Oh. - [screams] No! Fuck! Jack! [sobbing] - Well, I think we're done for now. - Okay, thanks. Hey, Sergeant Riley says we can go. - What was the baby called? - Jack Gahan. Come on. - No, I just-- I just want to be by myself for a minute. [man speaking indistinctly over radio] - Come on, Jen. - [sobs] [sobbing] My boy, Jack. I'm so sorry I left you. - Mummy, play with me. Play with me. - [sobbing] Daisy, don't touch. - Play with me. - Don't. [sobs] - Daddy, play with me. Please. Jack's asleep. He can't play with me. No one will play with me. - [whispering] Come here. [cans clanking] - Daisy? Daisy? You'd better come down from there. - [giggles] - Poor old Mr. Cryan, he won't like you being up there, come on. - Daisy! Daisy, get down from there. Daisy! You're going to fall. Daisy. [yelling] - What's happening? - Yeah, she seems fine. - You, are you okay? - Martha, you okay? - I'm-- I'm completely fine. I just got a fright. She just jumped. - Away with you! - [giggles] - I told you. She's crying for you. Can't you hear it? - Jenny, don't listen to him. - It's not too late. It's not too late to save her. - Shut your face, old man, or I'll shut it for you! - Jimmy. - Hey, come on. Come on, leave it. Go home. - Come on, you. [banging on door] - Tomas! Tomas! [banging continues] Tomas, we need help! Come on, Tomas! - Water. We need... - Ah. [flames crackling] [people yelling] - Ah, fuck. - Here, Martha. - Need more water! - More water! - Do you know where Daisy is, the little girl? Daisy? [men shouting] [child screaming faintly] [child screaming louder] - She's hysterical. I can't tell if she's hurt. Call Dr. Ferguson. - Can I help? I--I know her. - It's worth a shot. Just be careful. - Daisy? Daisy, sweetheart, it's me, Martha. Come on, sweetheart, come on. No, please, please. Turn it off. - [screams] - Sweetheart, come down. You're safe now. Come on. - Martha. - Come on. - Martha. - Come on. That's it, good girl. It's okay. - Move along now, folks. Thanks, there's no more to be done. Thanks. [screaming] - Jenny! - Come on! - It's Jenny. - You should have left her to burn. Dia linn. Dia linn. Dia linn. - Now just take another deep breath in for me. - [inhales] - Good girl. Well, her lungs are clear, thank God. - She doesn't need to go to the hospital? - Ah, she's fine, just exhausted. - Ah, the social worker's going to be a couple of hours yet. - Maybe she could sleep here. - Of course. Whatever's best for Daisy. - Let me take these off, because they're all dirty. Here. Thank you. Keep you nice and warm. Here. Yeah. You put your feet under there. You keep warm. What does "dia linn" mean? - "God be with us." [objects banging, clattering] [packages rustling] Jesus, Daisy. Do you like porridge? Here, let me cook it for you. Come on. - [gasps] - Daisy? [sighs] Martha! [Daisy crunching food] Martha! - Morning, Mr. Conroy. I'm Margaret Lindsay from the Western Health Service's social work department. You have Daisy Gahan? - We do. - Is everything okay? - Ah, well, now it is. Come on in. - Look, I can't find any extended family, and there's a dire shortage of foster carers available. She's lucky to get a bed. - Maybe she could stay here for a couple of nights until they find a foster family for her. - No, but, Martha, you're exhausted. - No, no, I'm fine. You know, it's Daisy that I'm worried about and her mental stability. - But there are procedures to be followed. You're not qualified, and she needs to be assessed. - Well, she clearly has difficulties. I mean, do you think it's-- do you think it's possible she has something like autism or something? - Maybe, she's just in shock, you know, after what she's seen. - I'm afraid I don't know. There's been no file on Daisy. - Yeah, but surely her school had some idea? - She never started school. - [sighs] - Look, can you get her things, and I'll take her now. - That's ridiculous. - Come on, Daisy, love. - I'll get her things. - Do you like ice cream? What's your favorite? Chocolate? - [screaming] - Come on now, Daisy. Daisy, stop it now. Daisy, you're all right. Daisy, stop it! - Please, just leave her. - [screams] - Daisy, it's Martha. Come on, Daisy. Daisy, it's Martha. Come on. Daisy, come on. Come on. [whispering] That's it, good girl. I mean, maybe, you know, she could stay just for a couple of days while you get a foster family for her? - I'll have to speak to my team leader but, yeah, maybe for a couple of days till she's settled, but I'll be back for her. Here's my card if you need to contact me. - All right, thanks. - No one's going to hurt you. [door clicks shut] Okay? You're safe. - [over radio] Hopefully shining some light on what seems to be a very common... [tires squealing] [tires screech] [tires squealing] [metal crashing, glass shattering] [haunting music]  - There was no sign of her in the house, not even a toy. Looks like she's been living in the shed. Has she said anything about what happened? - She hasn't said a word. Do you think it was an accident? - Petrol all over the place. Would have gone up like a bomb. One of them could have caught fire. The other one tries to help. They catch fire too. But what really bothers me is why they built it in a fairy ring. - It wouldn't mean anything to them. - Yeah, but, Tomas, they could have built it anywhere. And on Halloween night... - [screaming] - I'm going to take her home, okay? - One of us should stay. - No, we love Daisy. Smile at Daisy like you smile at Martha. Yeah. - Tell Martha I sorted it, though. I bought only the best. - [squeals] Mine, my doll, mine! - That's grand, thanks. - Give me it. Give it. Give it! It's mine. - Oh. Daisy? Will you give the doll back to Eva? - Eva, love, give Daisy the doll. You promise to look after him, don't you, Daisy? - Say thank you, Daisy. - Come on, Eva. [baby doll crying] - So what shall we call him? [scissors snipping] Shall we call him Murgatroyd? [giggles] No? Bertie? No. I like Eddie. Shall we call him Eddie? Okay. I think it's time for Eddie to have a sleep now. Put Eddie to bed? Good night, Eddie. [baby doll cries] Would you like to tuck him in? Here, there you go. His new blanket. Oh, no. No, we mustn't do that. If you look, the baby needs to be able to breathe, so we pull the blanket back down and tuck him in. He can breathe now. I'm going to have a baby. Feel my tummy. Baby's saying, "Hello, Daisy." [man speaking indistinctly over radio] - Well, how long did they say they're going to be? - They didn't say. - Yeah, okay, we'll see. - Easy there with that rope, Jack. Slowly, slowly, slowly. - I will do. Okay, thanks, bye. - Okay? - Oh, Daisy. That's kind. Thank you. - [whispering] Martha. - Can you draw a green circle? - Margaret Lindsay's had an accident. Social worker. She's dead. They, uh, they want her to go to the care home. Daisy? [plaintive music]  Hello, I'm Tomas Conroy. - Tomas. - This is my wife, Martha. - Hello, this is Ciara. You're sharing a room with Ciara. - Hello, my name is Ciara. - Give me her bag. - Daisy. - Mummy! Mummy! [shrieking] Mummy! - Listen to this. It says, "'Autism,' from 'auto' for 'self' or 'same,' "the tendency to view life in terms of one's own needs and desires." It says here they don't like to be touched. Well, she touches me. She looks me in the eye. - No, she doesn't look at me. - Ah, look at you. Where you going? - I thought we might go for a little walk, maybe to the playground. - I need to finish this. - Okay. See you in a bit. Hello. [woman vocalizing] [peaceful instrumental music]  - Do you like living with Martha and Tomas? Do you miss your mum and dad? Would you like to sit down again, Daisy? Do you remember anything about the fire? - It was hot, hot, hot, hot. - Daisy, did someone hurt you? Who hurt you? - Well, you have a lovely home and a good support network, and more importantly, Daisy seems very happy here. Ah, ah, this is Tomas, my husband, who I was telling you about. - Hello, Tomas. - Hello. - These ladies are from the social services. - Hello. - Well, there should be no problem with the application, and we'll be in touch about her assessment. - Okay. - And lovely to meet you. - Lovely to meet you too. Thank you for coming. - Okay. Thank you. - Very nice to meet you. - Tomas, bye. - Thank you for coming. [door clicks shut] - What's going on? - I've had to apply for us to foster Daisy. - Do I have any say in this at all? - Yes, of course. I mean, nothing's been decided yet. You know, there's-- there's still assessments to be made. Tomas, she needs a family. - Is this about Chloe? - No, not at all, no. This is about Daisy and what she needs. She's happy here. She makes me happy. I love her. - Hello? Everybody, quiet please. Can everyone say hello to Daisy Gahan. all: Hello, Daisy Gahan. Two times two is four. Two times three is six. Two times four is eight. - [giggles] - [giggles] Look at me, Mummy. Look at me. I'm a fairy. - Why lock it with your one inside? - Evening, Sean. - No one mixes with that crowd and comes away unmarked. - Oh, for Christ's sake. - She has Martha bewitched. There'll be no room for your little one. - Stop it, Sean. That's enough. I don't want you around the house, okay? - Whatever you do, don't say no to her. - [giggles] - [shuddering] [giggling] - Rip it. Come on. [laughs] Oh. [laughter] It's pretty, isn't it? Daisy chose it. Do you like it? - Yeah, but this is the baby's room, isn't it? - No, no, the baby's going to sleep with us to start with, anyway. - Right. Hey, take it easy. Let me do it. - Thank you. That bit up there. [kids squealing] No, Eva, come back. Go on, keep on going. [laughter] Hello. Come on. - Go on, that's right. Faster. Come back. [low, spooky music]  [laughs] - Do you want to have a go? Oh, you dropped it. Where's it gone? Hello. Hello. Hello. [giggles] [air hisses] [dryer whirring] - Cat? Cat? Cat! - Huh? - Have you seen the girls? - Are they in the loo? - Daisy? Daisy! Oh, my God. Help! Help! She's down there! Daisy, get off me! - Martha! - Stay down there! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God! - She's a changeling. - [gags] - How's Eva? - She's fine. Can we just get in the car and go home? Daisy, get in the car. Tomas! - They're saying she's a changeling. - Oh, come on, it's bullshit. It's superstitious bullshit. - Eva could have died in there. - Cat, it was my fault, and it was an accident. - Cat? - Daisy, I asked you to get in the car. - Did you see what happened? - No, I didn't. I left them alone for a minute. It was an accident. - What happened, Daisy? - It was an accident. - Daisy! Daisy, I'm sorry! - Daisy! Daisy! Come on. Come on, it's all right. It's okay. - Baby's head is at the bottom, but we're not able to tell if it's engaged or not yet. - Oh, look at him. He's beautiful. Hello, Daniel. Hello. - Mr. Cryan, are you in there? [latches clunking] Mr. Cryan? What happened to you? - She spat on me. - Who? - [giggles] - W-what's that? - The tree? You really, really should get that looked at. I think it's infected. - Where's the girl? - [chanting] Ahh...ya... - Now, Daisy, go outside. Please, wait for me outside. - Away! - Go on. It's only Daisy. - [gasping] [tapping at window] - [giggles] - Away with you! - Mr. Cryan, it's only Daisy. - Oh, God. - Ahh...ah-ah. - Oh, God. - Boo! - Away! - [giggles] - Oh, God. - I'll just go and phone Tomas, okay? - Oh, God, help us. Oh, God, help us. Oh, God. - He's promised to see the doctor in the morning. - What about Daisy? - He thinks that she's a fairy changeling. - A fairy? - Yeah, that she's not human. - He's completely mad. It's not just him. I've seen the way people look at her. It's like they're afraid. - It's a small place. Things don't change. People really believe that stuff. If they thought that Daisy was a a fairy changeling, then Halloween is the one night of the year when the door between this world and the next is open, and burning the changeling would force the fairies to bring back their real daughter. - Then they're all crazy. Forward, forward, forward. Left a bit. Left a bit. Right a bit. Right a bit. Ta-da. - [giggles] [baby cooing] [door clicks open] - Hi. - Hiya. Oh. - I'm glad you came. I didn't think... I-I don't blame you. - These things happen. - Yeah. [baby coos] - Oh. - How are you feeling? - Numb from the waist down, thanks be to Christ. I'm telling you, take all the drugs you're offered. - Where's Tomas? - He's in the car with Daisy. I thought it best. - Do you want to hold him? - Okay. - Aw. - He's big. - You're telling me. [giggles] - [sighs] [siren wails faintly] Daisy? [exhales] Daisy? - [pained gasp] Please. Daisy. [shudders] T-Tommy, get him for me, please. - Daisy. Daisy, give me the baby. Give me the baby. - There. [baby squeals] [shushes] Hey, I've got you. - Are you okay, sweetheart? - Is he okay? - It's okay. She was probably just trying to say hello. She doesn't realize, does she, Tomas? [baby crying] We'll go and sit in the car. I'm sorry. She doesn't mean any harm. - It's okay. - Come on, sweetheart. - He looks like Chloe. The day she died, Martha held on to her. She wouldn't let her go. And at first, it was the right thing to do. You know, the counselors encouraged us to hold her, say good-bye. But then Martha wouldn't eat. She wouldn't talk. I had to wait till she fell asleep before I could take Chloe away. [sniffs] - No. - Come on, sweetheart. - No. - Itll be fine. Shall we do it another day? - Yeah. - Yeah? Come on then. Come on then. Hold my hand. - Come on, Ris, good girl. - What would you like to do? Would you like to do some painting? - Yeah. - When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and down will come baby, cradle and all. Baby is drowsing, cozy and fair. - Marty? Marty, where are you? - Boo! - Oh! What's this? - Just having a bit of fun, that's all. - What the fuck... What the fuck do you think you're doing? - I'm having a laugh. - What? A laugh, is it? - Yes. - Is it? - Yes. - Well, who's laughing, then? - I am. Why are you afraid of her? - I'm not afraid of her. - Do you know what changelings really were? Listen, they were the children that no one wanted, okay? They were the sick and the crippled, you know, the ones who ate too much when there wasn't enough food to go round. Their parents didn't know what to do with them. They wanted to get rid of them, so they burned them or drowned them, and they blame it on the fucking fairies. - Yeah? Well, there's a tidy logic in that. Tell me, Martha. Tell me, what's-- What are we going to call him? - Who? - [sighs] Come on, our baby. - Oh, don't change the subject. - Our baby, our baby boy. I'm not changing the subject. What are we going to call him, huh? Have you even thought about it? I mean, have you thought of even one name? Have you? You're completely obsessed with her. Fuck you. [door slams shut] - Hello, stranger. - Hey. - Where's Martha? - She's at home. You want a drink? - I see you're making friends. - No one wants to play with me. - It's your little fairy. And Sean Cryan is terrified of her. I mean, I don't believe a word of it. But, really, what do you expect if you let her run around town dressed like a fairy? Come on, Tomo. Think about it. Honestly, it's hard enough bringing up your own kids. Brian and I never got a break, and look where we ended up. But to take on a child like that... - We haven't exactly taken her on. - Does Martha know that? Do you want a lift? - Great. - You could have called when you went away, sent a note. - You made your choice. - [laughs] Brian had a car. [laughter] - Yeah, Brian's car. - All you had to do was say something. - [sighs] - Tomas, Tomas, stop, stop. You're drunk, and I'm stupid. - [sighs] - Oh, you love Martha. [sighs] You look at her the way you used to look at me. [chuckles] You have to tell her how you feel. - Yeah. [engine turning] [knocking at door] - Do you want to play with us, Daisy? - Come on, Daisy, want to play with us? - [giggles] - Come on, let's get her. Stand still, or I'll shoot, Daisy. Are you a fairy? - [giggles] - She's warm. - Play with me. all: No. - Play with me. Play with me. - No. - Play with me. - [screams] - Play with me. - Away with you. Quick. Away, away! Go home now! - [mimicking] Go home now. - Go home now. - Go home now. Go home now! Go home now! Go home now! - None of the children turned up for school today. The parents say they are keeping their kids at home until Daisy is removed, that she doesn't belong in the school. I'm sorry. I've never heard anything like it. - Hello? Help, please. Help! - Daisy? [door clicks shut] - Why are you here? Is Daisy sick? - I came to see how Lucy is. - It's meningitis. - [sighs] Oh. - They were all together, you know, yesterday, with Daisy. She turned on them. Tell me why Daisy isn't sick too. - I don't know. Oh, you don't believe this. [alarms blaring] - Oh. What's happening? Lucy? - I talked to the three of them. They all said the same thing. Maybe she didn't realize they were so close to the edge. You need to keep a closer eye on Daisy. - "Fierce hatred of a fairy woman, "and so bewildered and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her doom." Come on, it's bedtime now. Night-night. [kissing sound] Love you. [door clicks shut] What? What is it? - Sergeant Riley came to see me today. Apparently, Daisy thought it would be fun to play catch at the cliffs with Lucy and a couple of other kids. They all have meningitis now, except Daisy. - [scoffs] What are you saying? She's infected them? - No. - Well, what are you saying, then? - I don't want her in my life. I don't want her in my family. I'm saying she has to go. I love you. I miss you, come on. Come on, you have to put him first. There'll be no room for him when he comes. Listen to me. Listen to me. I don't care what's it called-- fucking fairies, autism, abuse, whatever came first. She's sucking everything out of us. - Mummy! - You have to choose. - Daisy, sweetheart, come on. You've got to go back to bed. - Martha, my love, come on. Don't do this. Don't do this, Martha. - Get off me, Tomas. - What are you doing? - It was dirty. - Oh, come on. Not all this again. It's the middle of the night. - I've finished now. It's all done. Come on, let's go to bed. No, no, please, don't touch this. Thank you, Daisy. No. Please, don't touch that. Put it back. - Tomas doesn't want us. We're bad. [cans clanking] - Daisy! [car engine rumbling] I can't find Daisy. I've been looking everywhere for her. I can't find her. - I'll bring you home. Bringing you home. - No, no, no, no, no, we've got to find her. - Come on, I'll call Riley. We'll find her. - [humming softly] La, ah, la. [giggling] - Daisy! Daisy! - Daisy! - Daisy! - Daisy! - [shouts] Get back. Go away, go away! - Away! - [screams] [muffled screams] - This way, come on. - [yelping screams] [agonized screaming] - Sean, put it down. - Daisy! - Leave it! - Help me! - [yells] - Daddy! [screams] - Grab my hand. Grab my hand! Come on! - Burn her! - Come on, grab it. - Help me! - Kill her! Kill-- Burn her! - Come on, Daisy. - [screams] I can't! [screams] - Kill her! - You're okay. - Dia linn! [screaming] - [gasping] - She should sleep till tomorrow afternoon. It's not your fault, love. - No, I know. It's this place. - I don't want to tell you what to do. But she's not safe here. - But he's gone. Cryan's dead. - And your baby? Moving? Regular, vigorous? - Yeah. - You need to take care of yourself, Martha. Good night now. - Good night, doctor. [man speaking indistinctly over radio] - I'm still at Tomas Conroy's. I'll be back at the station later. - She's asleep. - Sergeant Riley was suggesting that Daisy needs to be somewhere where they have experience. You know, she needs counseling. She needs proper support. - In a home? She is not the problem. Everybody else is the problem. - But you can't deny that she has problems. And what about Eva, you know, Lucy, the kids? [liquid pouring] [cup bangs on table] - Look, nobody in this room is saying that Daisy is a fairy changeling. But I have no doubt that she is very troubled, and she might be dangerous. - What have you seen her do? Hey? What's anybody seen her do? - I know that Daisy tried to smother her little brother when he was a newborn. Now, Jenny Gahan told me that, and I believed her. And after that happened, Jenny never left Daisy alone in the room with him again. The day that she put him down for his nap, she put a latch across his door. Nobody else could have let him out of the room. Nobody else could have taken him to the beach. It had to be Daisy. Now we need to think about what's best for Daisy. Okay? I've contacted the health services. They want to take her. - When? When, when are they going to come and get her? - Do you think maybe that you could take her tonight? - No. No, no, no, no, no. - Martha, Martha, please. - After what she's been through tonight, she just should sleep here. You come back and get her in the morning. Okay? - Well, that seems fair enough. I'll be back first thing. [door clicks shut] [baby doll cries] [taps squeaking, water running] - Everything's going to be all right. There's something I have to do outside. [sandpaper scraping] [melancholy piano music]  [baby doll cries] [door latches clanking] [door creaks] - Go back to bed. It's really, really late. - I want to stay with you, Mummy. Please, let me stay with you. [water sloshing] - Do you want a bath? Come on. There, sit down. Tell me something, Daisy. What happened to your little brother? - He drowned. - Did you take him swimming? Did you wake him up from his nap? Did you undo the latch on the door? - Latch on the door. - Did you? - Did you? - Remember that day with Cat and Eva at the pool? - Remember that day with Cat and Eva at the pool? - Did--did you push Eva into the water? Daisy, look at me. What happened to your mummy and daddy? - Play with me. - No, sweetheart, no. - Play with me. - [whispering] What are you? - I'm a fairy. I'm a fairy. - No, you're not. No, no, don't. No, no, please. No, no, no. [whispering] No, no, no. - Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop  - Daisy, sweetheart. Daisy. Daisy, you're hurting me. - When the wind blows, the cradle will rock  - Please, Daisy, just let go. Daisy, you're hurting my tummy now. Daisy, please. [yells] [gasps] Oh, Daisy. Ah. Daisy. Daisy! Daisy, no! No! Daisy, let go, sweetheart! Let go. [sobbing] [gasping] Daisy. Daisy-- Daisy, get Tomas. Daisy, get Tomas. Please, please. [gasping] Daisy! [dryer whirring loudly] [water dripping] - Martha? Oh, God, Jesus! Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Oh, no. Oh, no. No! [sobbing] Oh...
