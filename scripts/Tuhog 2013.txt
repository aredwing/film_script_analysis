We've come up with a formula. Each person has a life equal to 50 points. Points are deducted for every injury. Example, we admit a gunshot victim with injuries to the heart and lungs. For critical organs, on a scale of 1 to 5, the heart scores high at 5 points. Since the injury is severe, that also counts as 5 points. We multiply the organ at risk by the severity of the injury. 5 x 5 = 25 points. The bullet grazed the lungs, 4 points. And 2 points for sutures. We multiply 4 x 2 = 8 lf we add it all up, 25 + 8 = 33 points. The patient arrived unconscious and with no vital signs. His physiologic score is automatically the most severe. 20 points. Remember each person has 50 points? Zero means no life. 50 - 53. He's gone. He gets a zero, he's dead. lt's just that simple? Yes. What about them? What's their score? Accident? Please come to the hospItal. Okay. Thank you. Your father had an accident! What? l hate you! Hello, ma'am?! Caloy was in an accident. What?! Please come to the hospital. Okay. Nurse, we're Caloy Sicat's friends. Wayne. Wayne. Impaled? How? Skewered. lmpalement. lmpalement... This is how it happened... when the bus hit the fence, the three patients were hurled to the front.... and impaled on a pole. All three together on one pole? Are they alive? Yes. How will they remove the pole? We can't, they're alive because of the pole. The pole serves as a tamponade. Tamponade? What is that, doctor? lf we stick this straw into this juice pack... As long as it remains in the pack... lt will not leak out, right? But once we remove the straw... See... Doctor, how wIll you proceed? The pole can only be removed in the operating room under direct vision... to repair the damage. But Holy Family hospital only has 2 operating rooms. So what now? There are three patients! One will be left impaled? Yes. What happens to his chances? The longer they stay on the pole, the lesser the chance of surviving. Doctor, did l understand it correctly? You're saying the last one left impaled on the pole... will die? But who? Who's going to die? Sanchez, needle! Four points lungs. Times one point because of the pole. So, 50 - 4... she still has 46 points. When is the baby due? l'm not pregnant. Yes, you're pregnant. Looks like you're in your sixth month. BP 90/50. Pulse 100. 46 - 10 points = 36. l need to talk to Angel. Excuse me. Let me pass. Pulse: 1 40. BP weak, 50/30. He's in shock! Minus 1 5 points. 35 points left. -Excuse me. -Ouch! Ouch! Wait a minute. Hey? Hey! Calm down. lf l die, Angel might break up with me! He's a candIdate for perIhepatic packIng. 1 6, liver surgery. He's down to 1 9 points. Rochelle, do we have a saw? Huh? No. Look for a carpenter. Doctor, l'm ticklish! 120/90. Pulse: 92. The old man is stable. Only 5 points minus. He has 45 left. Can we pole remove the pole now? Yeah, this is too close for comfort. lf we remove that pole, you'll all die. Sanchez, call radiology. Find a way to get an x-ray. Who paged? What's up? Woah! Heart plus major vessel equals 20. The woman only has 4 points left. Why are they still alive? What's the score of the guy with the punctured liver? 19. The old man is at 45. The old man is the most benign? Sanchez, get the ambulance. We can transfer him to JR. -Ouch! -He's unconscious! Take him off. Take hIm off. Oh no! l'm late! l'm late! Dad, you... are... retired! l'm so dumb! Now, you can eat a proper breakfast! l lost my appetite. Ugh. This doesn't feel right. ls this my chair? l knew it, this isn't my chair! Where is it? Dad, your heart. Please... relax! Mercy, l want my chair! Tonio! You're behaving like a child! Adrian, go get it. Yes mom. Dad, this could collapse anytime. -Dad! -Oh! See. My butt fits perfectly. Any plans for today? None. Dad, banana fritters for you. Dad... you've got your retirement pay, right? So? Uhmm... Bobby's aunt has a business proposal. A spa franchise. And so? Bobby said... Where is your husband? lf he wants something, he should ask for it himself. Bobby! Come here. You explain the spa. lt is a good investment. Go visit it, dad. We'd like to advance Faith's share from your retirement pay! Damn it! l'm retired! Not retarded! Wait for me to die before you split up my money. Did you see my cell phone? Where did l last put it? Tonio, what happened here? l've misplaced my phone. Antonio! You'd misplace your head if it weren't stuck to your body. Oh! lt's ringing. Where is it? Oh, Tonio! Oh! Hey! lt's Lando! Hello? Poker Two? Sure. l'll be there, l'll be there. Oh! Dad... where are you going? To your Uncle Lando's. How are you getting there? By bus. Who will be there? Just me, your Uncle Lando, Bert and Jun... What time will you be home? l'll be back by midnight. Oh no, Dad. That's too late! You should be home by ten. Huh?! Okay. Be safe. Hold on to the rail! Hold on! Macasaet, drive any faster and you'll kill somebody! Hold on! Grandpa, have a seat. Ah! Macasaet! Be considerate of the old man! Quit making sudden stops! lt's nauseating! Sir, where to? Downtown. 21 . What the...?! Macasaet! This is going to take forever... Who taught you how to drive?I Your mother?! A blind man can drive better than you! We're now here in downtown. -BaclaranI -That smells good. Baclaran! How much? Two pesos. Give me a dozen. Sir, please spare me some change. l'm sorry, boy. l don't give coins. You're going to die. Hey, kid! Get out of here! That was scary. lt gave me goosebumps! You son of a bitch! What did you do?! Delfin! You wrecked my house! You bastard! Delfin! Stop it! -He destroyed our house! Bastard! -She's my wIfe! Stop It, Delfin! Then there was a fIstfIght... lt seems one guy stole the other guy's wife. Sounds like a soap opera. So, who has the three clubs? Not me. Do you have it, Bert? Wait. l've been dealt a bad hand. l bet you got all twos. You joker. l'm getting hungry. Quit badgering me. Here! Say thank you. l almost died because of this pandesal. And it tastes like crap. A true pandesal should be crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. Easy to chew. Not too sweet. A real pandesal is not full of air. This is not a pandesal! Not a pandesal at all! That's just pandesal. Take it easy. Yeah, right. Where did that come from? Nothing. Getting old is tough. Hello. Where have you been? School. Bye. -Oh... -CrapI That play makes no sense! Mercy! l'm late! Why didn't... Mercy! Mercy! What is it? Where's my chair? Lord! l thought you were in trouble! Where's my chair? Antonio! Stop it. You're behaving like a child. Did you throw it away? Did you throw away my chair? How many times do l have to tell you not to touch my chair?! We can always buy a new one. No. Never! Why are you doing this? Just because it's old, it's useless? You're being overdramatic, Tonio. There's no need to get mad! We're just concerned for you. Adrian. Adrian! Yes mom? Give your father his beloved chair. Dad!! lt's your fault, you know. You're fighting mom over a chair. l don't care. lt's almost lunch and you're just having breakfast? Time moves slower when you're older. Are you going out? Yes. Why? No, dad. You can't go out. And why not? l will leave when l want to and l'll come home if l want to. Let me remind you, l am still the head of this family. And l will do what l want. Nobody can tell me what to do. Dad, you can't leave with just your briefs on. Put on some pants. l will leave when l'm in my pants. -Son of a bitch! -Pass. You don't have a single? None. He said we did it? We never even dated. He's a liar. Who is she arguing with? l guess her boyfriend. When you're young, you think the world's ending when you fight with your boyfriend. We used to be so innocent. Ha! You were never innocent. You were a pervert. l would give anything to be young again. Me... l just woke up one day, and l was old. Now my kids think they're better than me. You know, growing old is not for the faint of heart. Being sixty isn't so bad. Seniors get a twenty percent discount. And a full house. Pass. Pass. l don't want to claim my senior citizens card. You should. lt's useful. l don't want to. l don't want to be officially old. The lD will only remind me of how old l've become. That our lives are about to end... That we are just waiting for death... Pair king. Pass That's sad. What's wrong? Why? Who said l was happy in the first place? On a scale of one to ten, l'm a one. Huh? Just one? No chance of a ten? There is... if l get a new lease on life. lf l get to do what l want. And what's that? To bake. To what? To bake. Bake? Our old lady wants to bake! Do you know how to bake? l can learn. When l was young, l used to watch my grandmother bake. And l know the taste of a good pandesal. l just need to get it perfect. lf you're serious, l know a good location for a bakery. Leave it all to me. lsn't it great? Perfect for a bakery. Perfect if you want to get gangrene. Will they give you a health permit for this place? A little cleaning and this place will be good as new! A little?! A little cleaning? l can see it now... You can have tables here for dine in guests. Over here will be the shelves for the bread. And here, the counter... And here is where the magic happens! Aaah! A rat! A cat will solve that problem. So? What do you think? Bert, maybe we should check other places too. This is a bargain at 1 5,000. l might even be able to get it down to 10,000, lncluding the equipment. For only 80,000 this bakery is yours. This place is just right for a bakery. Take it. Before someone else does. Who do l write the cheque to? You won't regret it. This bakery is a best buy. And so... l bought a bakery. Huh? Why? Are you crazy, Tonio? A barber shop? Ba... ker... y. Your retirement pay is all gone, dad? So what? lt's my money. At your age, why are you taking a risk? l am old so l have nothing to lose. What if this fails,Tonio? Do you even know how to bake? Or how to run a business? No, but l know l want to be a baker. Looking good. l'm so happy you're here. You're not mad anymore? l could never stay mad at you. Oh. You fixed it. The guys helped me with it. This is nice. Here... this is for you. You look good. You make a handsome baker. Thank you. Good thing you're here. l wasn't sure if l was right or just an old fool. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size. Hey! Should l play your hand? l'm coming. l'm coming. Hurry. -What's the last play? -Here. Pair four. Yeah, l'm in. l wonder how things went at Maning's wake? l really don't want going to those things. l hope Maning is playing poker in heaven. Here. There's gambling in heaven? Seven! lt's not heaven without poker. l'm sure his cards are always good, because it's heaven. Like these cards? Give me a chance to play. Remember Maning used to pick his nose whenever he got a good hand. -Jun... -Hey! l miss that guy. Which one of us will die last? Don't they say the bad egg dies last? Here! Let's see those twos. All's lost. Here. Big two poker. lt's you who will die last. Tonio, how much yeast did you use? Jun said 60. 60? l said 16! 16?! Please sit down. You're making me dizzy. lt's rising. lt will bake faster if you don't watch. Come here and play with us. lt's your turn. Am l doing the right thing? l cannot fail. Pass. -Pass. -Pass. We'll lose all our savings. Pass. How will l explain this to Mercy? Pass. What will my children say? This is my last card. You're scaring me. You did not even let me play. What's that? Something's burning! Ah! My pandesal! Ouch, doctor! These are second degree burns. Doctor, will he make it? lt's not a brain injury! No need for last rites. You're not allowed to eat here. Sorry. Hey! Leave some for me. So? ls it good? The parts that were'nt burnt are okay. Hey. You have black stuff on your teeth. Right there. So do you. Me? -You too. -Me too? You're being too noisy. Please wait outside. What a grump... Dad, what happened to your hand? Just a minor injury. What's that? Biscotti? No, have some of my pandesal. You baked these? Yes. Let me taste them. They're delicious. Children, taste this. Go on. Get one. lt's good. Yum. Here, Faith. Bobby, get one. You know, Dad, you should stop this foolishness while you still can. lt's a waste of money, dad. We could have used that money ourselves. My whole life l did nothing but provide for all of you. Everything you wanted, l gave. This is the only time l'm doing something for myself. And you won't let me have it? You children are no good! This is really good! That's a lot of pandesal. Can you sell it all? Better than not having enough. Are you still making a profit at one peso? lt's only the first day. Here... take one. Dad, all you're selling is pandesal? What else will l sell? You need variety. What is your business plan? What's that? This is what we've been trying to tell you, Dad, This maybe the best tasting pandesal in the world... but if you know nothing about business, you will fail. Tonio, are you sure about this? You've been awake all night? How can l sleep when l'm worried about you. Are you sure about this? This has been a life-long dream. But you don't know what you're doing. Just this once... Can't l do what l want? -There's passenger. -Stop! Stop! Miss Dacanay, do you have any next of kin? No, he can't be here. How about the father of your child? You're pregnant. What for? He's unreliable. Dude... Dude. ls Fiesta Dacanay here? You're the new guy? You're dead, man. Dead. Do you have any other job options? ls there a problem? lf you're with Fiesta Dacanay... She's a terror. Terror. I hope you're not a crybaby. -She made Macasaet, her last driver, cry. -Yes. He cried? Yes. But why? She rained insults on him, accusing him of not knowing how to drive. Cursing him from head to toe. From the beginning to the end of the day. lf l were you, l'd back out. lt's Fiesta. Renato Timbancaya? Get on! Just call me Nato. Timbancaya, l'm very frank so l'll be blunt. l don't like you. lf you plan on staying long, you better listen. l am Fiesta. Happy Fiesta?! No. Just Fiesta. No happy. l was joking. There will be no joking. No reckless driving. No smoking. No drinking. No eating. No tardiness. You're wasting time, idiot. Move it. Passengers are waiting. Shit. Get InI Ma'am. Sir! Here. What? You're gonna cry? lf you're going to cry then get off. You're going to die! Devil boy! Who's going to die? You're pissing me off! Hey, Fiesta! He's just a kid! What?! Your fIrst day at work and you know better than me? Concentrate on your drivIng! From dawn to mIdnight and thIs Is all we made? We worked for nothing. lts only the bosses who are getting rich. Timbancaya... Can you check this out. What? Hey... hey! This bum is drunk. Hey, Sir! This is the terminal. You have to go. Come on, come on. Give me your hand. Get up. Come on. Oh, crap! lt's just vomit. Sir, just breathe deeply. Breathe in and out. Timbancaya, don't just stand there. Help me! We're going down, okay? Step down. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. One last step is high. ls this yours? Thanks. Hey, Nato! You survived! Join us! ls that bad, huh? -Fiesta is vile! A real bitch. -ls that bad, huh? Didn't l tell you to back out? She's domineering. That's the problem. She just needs some loving... -Kiss her. Just kiss her. -Are you mad? l won't kiss her even if you pay me. You're such a wuss. Listen... Fiesta does not scare me. l can take her on. l'll make her beg for mercy... so she better ease up or she's going to have it out with me. l can pummel her with kisses or pummel her with punches. The choice is hers. l'll take the punches! How long have you been standing there? Go home. You're drunk. Go home? lt's still early. l've only had one drink. Go home, I saId. You have work tomorrow. Says who? Says me. What? Should l let her have it? Nato! Nato, Nato! Are you okay? Nato, wake up! Nato! -Nato, get up. -Nato! Are you okay, Nato? Hey, Timbancaya! -You squished a passenger! -What? Timbancaya, you're an idiot! l'll report this! Please don't. They'll fire me. Fiesta! Please don't report me. l will lose my job. The other day you were on your high horse too proud to beg. Now look at you... Wimp! ls that so... Sorry. l really didn't want to kiss you. No, no, no. What l mean is... Just don't report me, please. The kid will not take legal action. The other bus made a sudden left. ls it my fault that the other driver is stupid? Fiesta? Fiesta! Hey! Pay for this. Thanks. l didn't know you were a girl. Shut up. What happened back there? Nothing. Hey, are you okay? -Give it here. l'm going home. -No! No! No! l'll walk you home. Whatever. l'll still report you. l'll leave your napkin here. l need to go. You're a real pain in the ass! Me? What did l do now? You're still here? lt's always the same! Why can't he just die?! Why can't a car run him down and put an end to this?! Or maybe a blow to the head will kill him... Fall to his death?! Or get struck by lightning?! Damn it! ls he here? Since we opened. Who does she want dead? Her father. Dad? Dad! Dad... Dad... Dad, let's go home. Dad, let's go... Timbancaya, since you're still here... make yourself useful. Help me with him! Put him down on the bed. Fiesta, is your mother home? Dad... -Dad... -l can do it. l can do it. This is my hell. Go ahead. Explain this. lt was an accident, boss. The bus made a sudden left. lt rammed us on the side. Boss,l didn't want this to happen. lt was an accident. Accident? And the taxi incident? Was that an accident too? What taxi? Boss, the taxi is a different story. You have a history of accidents! You should look for another job. You're a liability to Janus Express. Boss. Please. lt's not his fault. Not his fault? Yes. The other driver was to blame. We were parked when he rammed us. Fiesta, l'm making him your responsibility. l've already given him two chances, there will be no third. No, boss. There won't be a third. l promise. We'll be careful. -What are you waiting for?! Go! -Sir, thank you. Hey, Fiesta. Fiesta, thank you. l'm sorry. lt won't happen again. Make sure it won't. lt was your fault. Passengers were still getting on when you drove off! Clean up your act, Timbancaya! Or else l'll get rid of you myself! l will. Hey, Fiesta! Cubao Underpass! Cubao! Cubao! Cubao Underpass! Cubao Underpass! Cubao Underpass! Thief! -The man with a cap. Don't let him pass. -Cubao, Underpass. -Thief! -Hey, my cellphone! Hey! -Hey FIesta, waItI -Hey, my bracelet! Hold on, wait. Are you crazy? He'll kill you! My bracelet! That was given to me by my mother. lf he stabs me... Give it back! Bastard! Thief! l'll beat you up. -Sir, hang on. We can talk about this. -What? You're a hero, huh? No, here. Take it. Take it. lt's yours. Who do you think you are now? Bastard! -Come back here! -Where's my bracelet?! Where's my bracelet? -There.Thank you. -That's my cellphone. This bracelet? -Timbancaya, l already said thank you! -All l get is a thank you? -Why? What else do you want? -That's it. Go out with me on a date. Huh? Why? -l could have been killed. -Give that to me. So what? Give it to me. lf you're going to be that way, l'm keeping the bracelet. Give it back! No way. You'll get it back when we go out. Timbancaya! l'll pick you up Saturday. Don't forget. l hate you! ls it your treat?! Of course. And try to dress nice, not like a dyke. Dress nice, okay? Let's go! Fiesta, you have a visitor. Fiesta, you have a visitor. Who? Nato. Where are you going? We're just going to eat at... What? Nothing. Nothing. Let's go! What time will you be back? Why, dad? Uhmmm... just before midnight. Son, this is my only child. Take care of her. Oh, dad. Don't worry. l'll keep her safe. You look nice. You look like a girl. Are you okay? l'm fine. We'll go ahead, Sir. Son of a pizza! Just use your hands. No thanks. l'm not hungry. Fiesta, what now? Let's sit a while. My feet hurt. Wait. What now? Can you still walk? Give me your shoes. Give them to me. Or else carry me home. But you're heavy. Timbancaya, you're pissing me off. Go on. Take them off. Are you serious? Fine, here. So what do l use? How will l walk? Here. These suit you. Balut! Balut! Hey! Hey! Balut! Balut! Wait for me. You're not hungry, huh? l have simple tastes. l don't like fancy places. You didn't have to spend so much. l just wanted to thank you. For helping me out. Here. What's so special about this bracelet that you would die for it? My mom gave this to me when l was five. lt was my mom who named me Fiesta. Because she wanted everyday to be happy. Maybe that's why my father feasted on drink all year round. So where is your mother now? One day she just got fed up and left. l will never forget that day. We were in a mall. She said she needed to use the toilet. We waited for her for a long time. l remember the salesladies putting away their merchandise... The guards pulling down doors... The lights flickering off... Now l look like a fool. When l'm in the mall during closing time, l panic. l can't help it. lt's like my mother is abandoning me all over again. Do you have a hanky? Yeah. Your mom still cares for you. She didn't care for me when she left, why would she now? That's depressing. Come on, let's drink. Yes? l'm going home. He's only after one thing. And once he gets it, he will leave you! And that's the truth! Dad. Go! Ouch! Dad! You think he likes you? Have you seen yourself in the mirror?! No one will love you. That's why your mother left. He will leave you too. Dad, please! Come here. Calm down. You're hurting Fiesta. Stay out of this! Why do you even care?! Huh? Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? -Come. Come on. -Dad! She's hurting. Dad! Nato! -Nato. -He's hurting you! Do you see what sort of a man he is?! Rude! Leave. You're making me leave? He's the one who is drunk. Leave us! l am just concerned for you. l do not want you to get hurt. l'm sorry l pushed your father. Forgive me. l was just concerned for you. l do not want you to get hurt. Let's just do our jobs. l've had enough. l can only handle one drunkard in my life. Passengers. Bus. Stop, stop. Stop, stop. Miss, will this pass by the hospital? -Yes. Holy Family Hospital. -Come on, let's get in. Get on. Here. Sit here. Your hands... Let's go. Fare for how many? -Four, miss. -What? Wait! Wait! l'm getting on the bus. -Thirty six. -Wait. Here, l have a coins. -There it is. -Wait, wait. -Get that, please. -Pick it up... by your foot. There. Let's talk. About what? Don't get mad at me. l'm not your father. Timbancaya, what are you talking about? What if... what if we become a twosome? What sort of twosome? A couple. What if l court you? Court me? How? Courtship... why are you being dense? Me, dense? You're the one who's not making sense. Look at Nato! Huh? Nato and Fiesta! What? Kissing! See! Dad! Dad! Dad, what have you done? Dad! Dad, wake up! Dad, no! Dad, wake up! Dad! Dad, please! He's angry at me. Your father needs stitches. ls he allergic to any medicine? Doctor, there was a lot of blood. l was scared. ls he going to die? ls he allergic to any anaesthesia? Doc, why would he do this? ls it my fault? l don't know. But if you really want to help your father, you need to clam down. What medicine is he allergic to? The doctor said you should stay put. Or your wound might rip open. lf you need anything, call me. My child, l'm sorry. l won't do it again. l was just scared that you would leave me like your mother did. That you'd find someone else. Promise you'll never leave me. How can you abandon your father? You and your mother are the same! You think you're better than everybody else. lf you don't want to stay then get out. Run to that man! Who's there? Lolet? Fiesta. What... l thought... No. lt's just me. Can l come in. Of course. Come in. What happened? Can l stay here for a while, please? Sure. No problem. Give me your bag. lf l move out of my father's house, where can l go? You came to the right place. Stay with me. ls this Lolet's? No. Lolet and l are over. Really? ls that so? This... whose toy is this? Fiesta... Fiesta, trust me. l am not trying to deceive you. Listen to me. lf you wish we can get married tomorrow. l'll take you away from your father so he can't hurt you anymore. Okay? Nato. Mmm? We're late. Get up. l'm leaving. -Come back to bed. -Wait. Quit it. Stop! Stop. Stop! -Stop being coy. -l said no. l said no. Stop it. When was my last period? Fiesta. l'm here for you. Slow down. There's a kid. Ahh! Papa. Papa. Baby. l can explain. This is my daughter, Bea. Nato. Bea, come here. -Papa is working. We'll talk to him later. -You don't need to explain. Lolet? Fiesta. Get a room! Sir, stop! Let's go. Hurry up. He's lying to you! Dad... Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad! Are you still mad? Fiesta, she left me for another man. My whole world ended. l thought she'd never return. When l met you, you gave me a reason to live. What does she want? She wants to come back. And what do you want? You. What about your daughter? l don't want to leave her but what can l do? One day, Bea will forgive me. l could never forgive my mother for abandoning me. -Full tank. Let's go! lt's late. -Wait a minute. l love you. Your daughter needs you. Stay with your family, Timbancaya. Dad? l'm home. Dad! Dad... Dad? Dad, what's that? -l need a sip. Just a sip. -Dad, let go of it! -You can't drink this! You'll die! -Leave me alone! -Give it to me! -Just a sip. l'm really thirsty. Hey! Fiesta! Fiesta! Just a sip. Please let me have some. Fiesta. Give it back! Stop meddling. l need a drink! I'm thirsty. Just a little sip. FIesta! Open thIs doorI l am so thirsty. Please, let me drink. Open up!! You'll be sorry if you don't open this door! Open it! Open the... You'll be the cause of my death! Dad, this will pass. You can do it. You can do it. Fight it for both our sakes. Timbancaya! You're drunk. Yes, l am. And so what? You're better than me now? You were right to peg me as worthless? You know, people like you will never be happy. Your mother left you... because you have no heart. Fiesta, l am the only who ever loved you. Yet you chose to push me away. ls this the life you want? You only have yourself to blame for being alone. Doctor, the carpenter is here. All right, come here. l can't help you. lt's easy. We pull them apart, you start sawing. Why is there so much blood? D.l.C. D.l.C. Death is coming. He's already 1 9 -1 5. Whose blood is this? Yours. Those are contractions. She's about to give birth. What? She's pregnant? Give me the saw. We don't have much time. Earthquake! Caloy, you perv! You'll go blind! Angel, hurry. Take off your shirt first. Angel is so sexy. Can we watch? We'll be quiet. Angel is my girlfriend. Get lost. Get out. Go! What now? We're done? Jun Rey and I are meeting up early tomorrow. Jun Rey, Jun Rey. lt's always Jun Rey. There's no reason to be jealous.
