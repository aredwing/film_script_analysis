We make small choices that... Later on in life have consequences that we could never have foreseen. We seek out pleasures that very often are tools for the destruction of our souls. Without God as our guide, we wander unprotected through this valley of the shadow of death. By our very natures, we are weak. Let those of us who have gathered here today reach down into our own understanding and there find a place of forgiveness in our hearts. So let us not judge our brother James Richard Daniels. Instead, let's join together with his loving wife Marsha and his brother Edward in remembrance. And let's learn from Jimmy's life, and from the tragedy of his final years. Though confused and lost, with God's grace and mercy, Let's pray that Jimmy's soul has made its way to God's holy place. And let's take with us the clear understanding that there, but for the grace of God, go I. I'm sorry Marsha for your loss. Can I help? Thank you Father, no. I've had time to prepare for this. It wasn't exactly unexpected. Maybe if you'd stuck around, we wouldn't be here today. Who are you to point at me? Eddie, let's get out of here. - At least I was there for him. - Y eah, that was the problem. Marsha, are you all right? Edward, are you all right? No. Haven't you noticed, Father? I'm not. Ryan? Eddie, what happened to Jimmy? What, that's it? Just like that? "What happened to Jimmy? " You do two years in prison without letting anybody visit you, wouldn't even accept the letters that Jimmy fucking wrote you, man. Disappeared for two more years, nobody hears nothing from you. You just show up and you wanna know what happened to Jimmy? I heard he got himself clean. I heard he had it licked. How could you hear that? You ain't been around. You don't know what it's been like. - How you doing? - You know me, I do all right. Stabilized. You clean? How could you ask me that? I'm fine. I just wanna know how you're doing. I guess I'm doing about as good as I can do without having my big brother around to watch over me. Eddie, I'm sorry. You know, about being away so long. This whole thing with Jimmy. Really, I'm- I'm sorry. Yeah... Well... I'm sorry too. (honking) Sal! Hey, Eddie. I'm sorry to hear about Jimmy. He was a nice kid. Nice kid. Ryan. Hey, Sal. It's a lucky thing, you coming back just now, huh? I mean, in time for the funeral and everything. Yeah. Lucky thing. I guess you're gonna be a comfort to your brother. You know, like the old days. Listen, uh... I want you to have a drink on me. I mean for Jimmy, huh? Thank you, Sal. This is very generous. Yeah. Very generous, Sal. Very generous! Eddie, sorry about your brother. That's a tough break. Mike, a couple drinks on me for Eddie boy. Already been taken care of, compliments of Big Sal. Well, I'll be damned. Look who's here. - It's a free country. - Yeah? Vincent might not think so. Not today, Mike, not today. All right, for Jimmy's sake. God rest his soul. Keep loverboy outta sight. Asshole. To Jimmy. Did you see Carla? I almost didn't recognize her. She looks cold. Don't start with that shit, all right? Vincent, though... Vincent looks the same. Vincent's making lots of money for people. Big Sal gave his blessings to work this whole neighborhood, - so stay out of his way. - Eddie? I need to talk to you. Not right now, okay, Doreen? Eddie, you shouldn't have left me back at the- - at the cemetery. - Come here. Sorry about that. She's really cool, but she's a little fucked up right now, you know? So, tell me about the joint. When I got there, I didn't shit for five days. Oh fuck. I can't remember much of the first year. T ook me that long to get my head straight, you know? And then all I could think about was Carla, what she did to me. You should've seen that look in her eyes when they took me away. Look Ryan, everybody knows that Vincent made Carla set you up. I know. That's what I can't get out of my head. Stop. Just stop right there. Carla is Vincent's property now. Right after you got sent up, he put her in rehab, he married her, they had a kid, now she's a regular Suzie Homemaker. So get it fucking straight- he will fuck you up again if you even look at her. Yeah, I'll tell him. That was Charlie over at the Skillman Lounge. He said Vincent just left, he's looking all over for Ryan. Thanks Mike, I owe you one. You don't owe me shit. It's my place I'm worried about. No problem. You got it. Listen, about that talk you were gonna have with Big Sal about me, you set that up yet? H ey, asshole, forget about Sal. You're already overextended all over the street. Nobody wants to deal with you. Just get Ryan outta here. All right... but talk to Big Sal! Don't be a hard-on. Come on, there's gonna be a taste in it for you. T ake a hike! (salsa music playing) Hey, "paysan. " I can't believe this, twice in one day. First I bump into you at church, and now here. This is nice, am I right, huh? You know what? This calls for a celebration. Eddie, run across the street and go get us some beers. Peanuts always make me so dry. Do they do that to you, Mitch? - Yep. - Vince, Ryan and I were- Eddie, I got a real thirst here. Thank you. We're only gonna be a couple of minutes. We might even be quicker than that. So how you been? Now look at you, you're still dressing in rags. Your tastes were always more expensive than mine. Sometimes expensive tastes get you expensive things. Things that are real warm, real comfortable. I don't know- things that fit real good. If you don't mind that another man wore them before you. Peanut? Wait, wait- let me see if I can remember. That's right, you've always been a lover not a fighter, right, Romeo? You never did know how to play your hand and it seems like the game ain't exactly going your way right now. You knew what would happen if- if I ever saw you again. You knew. You know what? All that can wait. Today is a day of celebration- of old friends getting together. And today we have peanuts... and now we have beer. So, Ryan, you take a couple of days, and you mourn your dead junkie brother, and then you go away. And then what? If my old friend here isn't out of Astoria very, very soon then... Let the games begin. Oh and, Ryan... I'll be watching, my friend, I'll be watching. Mitch, what are you doing? What I was told to do. Yeah? Now I'm telling you to get out. He ain't gonna like that. Mitch, I said get out. - Ryan: So he sent you? - Woman: Yeah. Well, I'm here. Seem to have done real well for yourself. Everything has its price. And everyone? - Did he hurt you? - What do you care? You know me better than that. I knew a lot of things till you set me up. - H e made me do that. - Did he put that look in your eye when they dragged me out of our bed? I was high and I was scared. And I needed help and Vincent was there. Nobody could get you to marry him- not if you didn't want to. There are so many things you don't understand. All I know is my brother's dead. - I'm sorry about Jimmy. - Y eah? You can't feel too sorry- even though you got clean, that outfit, those earrings, this car were paid for by that shit Jimmy shot into his arm. And it all comes from Vincent. So tell me, when you're with him and you're alone in his bed, and you're playing the submissive little housewife, do you still feel sorry or are the perks too fucking good? I hate you. I hate you. T ell your husband I got a few things to take care of, and then I'll be gone. He came to the stopover on 14th Street, just rolled over and nodded out right on the passenger seat. The truck was right in the middle of the intersection. The doors were locked, "Freebird" playing on the radio, engine running. Some psycho took out a bat and started smashing it on the side of the truck. Cops had to smash in the windows, they pulled him out. They gave him a DWI right on the spot. Jimmy said, "They had to get a tow truck for my tow truck. " Jimmy could never keep a job. Yeah. After that, nobody'd hire him. Marsha left him and... Jimmy had nothing. Hi. Come here. Come here. Come here. He kinda looks like Jimmy. Yeah, Jimmy and I took after our mother. Ryan and I are just hanging out. Well, I-I'll go into the bedroom and- Why don't I leave you two alone for a while? Why? Come on, it's early. It's all right. I'll see ya later. All right. H ere, use my keys. Thanks. Do you think I scared him off? No. It's okay. It's all right. We okay? No. Go ahead. I love you, baby. I love you. I love you too. H ey, Champ. Your eggs look like someone murdered 'em. They're bleeding all over the place. They got shot like what happened to that man where you work. Boom-boom-boom, you're dead, I got you, you're dead. Who could've told you that nice little story, huh? I wonder. It's 8:00 a. m. and he's just getting in. (speaks Spanish) Carla: Enough. I'll fix you something to eat. You see how nice Mommy talks to Daddy? Maybe if T eressa is nice, she might become a mommy too one day. So how'd it go? Couldn't be too concerned, if you stayed out all night. Why? Should I be concerned? - No. - No, what? No, Vincent, you shouldn't be concerned. T eressa, take Tyler out to the park. Daddy wants to talk with Mommy for a minute, okay? Give me five. All right! (alternative rock music playing) ~ The first time is always the best ~ ~ Y eah... ~ ~ Sit back, relax and don't resist ~ ~ Resist, resist ~ ~ Now you're on the other side ~ ~ Resist, resist... ~ So how'd it go? I conveyed your message, he's leaving and that's it. That was all? We spoke, and now he's leaving. What else can there be? - I don't know, you tell me. - Vincent, there's nothing there. Then tell me. Say it. What else? You know what else. T ell me. T ell me. Come on, pussycat, tell me. - That you're my man? - Mm-hmm. Who takes care of me, and I take care of him? - And I'm his. - Yeah. Huh? Isn't that what you wanna hear, baby? Hmm? You mean everything to me. You know that, don't you? If I even thought for a second- - Hi, Father. - Ryan. How are you? It's been hard. I just- I wanted to thank you for calling me about Jimmy and the words you said at the funeral. He always loved this place. What is it, Ryan? Father, it's Eddie. I'm worried about him. I just don't know enough about what's going on. Sometimes I can help. - Come inside. - No, I can't. Come inside the confessional. I can help. (heavy breathing) Yes... Ryan! I knew you were gonna be here. Hey. Jimmy and me used to come up here, you could never find us. Bullshit, I knew where you were. I just didn't wanna spoil it by finding you. - You can see Manhattan from here. - Yeah, there's more past that. Not for me. Not anymore. - What about Jersey? - Oh, Jersey! Ew! Come on, pack your bags, get your shit, we'll just go. - Hey, come on, stop that! - Hey, Ryan's rules are back! I'm your big brother. I'm supposed to watch out for you. You were supposed to look out for me and Jimmy. - That was your job. - It's not too late. - Jimmy might think so. - (beeper sounding) - Gotta go. - Is that Vincent? H ey, you see this? Some people make it outta here and some people don't. You did it the hard way but you made it out. I didn't. I'm still here. This is my world. And I like it. He's calling me, I gotta get back to it. Do you, Eddie, I mean, do you really? Yeah. Eddie, come on, I'm still your big brother. Yeah... you're still my big brother. Hey. I'd invite you in, but you know how she is. Um, this is some of Jimmy's stuff. There wasn't much left. He just about sold everything. You sure you don't want any of this? I'm sorry, but I gotta walk away from this. I feel like I've been hit by a freight train. It's been hard on me. It's been really hard. Oh, uh... these are... Jimmy's letters that you returned unopened. It hurt him that you wouldn't read them, but he wrote you all the time. He just stopped mailing them. I guess- he didn't want you to know he was in trouble. Didn't want to bother you with that stuff. H e wrote up until the end and towards the end he was just- well, you wouldn't have recognized him. Woman: Marsha. I gotta go, Ryan. I gotta go. You know, when we were all growing up, you three brothers were really something. You were really something. What happened, Ryan? What happened to all of us? Mitch, what exactly did he say to you? He said he'd be here. Where is the little prick? Three times I paged him, nothing. That whole fucking family was always just one big piece of shit. We'll find him. I want him out on the street now. And no more fuck-ups. Doreen: Eddie! Get up! Eddie! Get up! What happened! What did he have? What'd you give him? What did he take? What did he take? Eddie, come on, breathe, Eddie. Breathe. Doreen, call an ambulance. Doreen, call an ambulance. Eddie, come on. Eddie, come on. Roll over, cough it up, cough it up. Come on, come on, breathe, Eddie. Breathe, Eddie. Come on, don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep, Don't fall asleep! Eddie, don't fall asleep! come on, come on! Doreen, call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Eddie... no more, okay? No more. Hey... finally a companion for life. Who else will marry you looking like that? Whoever she is, she'll be a satisfied woman, that's all I can say. By the mere fact that a woman knows I'll be her brother-in-law, that's enough to satisfy her? It might if you weren't so damn ugly. Can I help it if my brother got the good looks? Nope. Go on... say it. Okay. You're in a lot of trouble here. - You're out of control. - What are you doing? - I'm not a kid anymore. - Then stop acting like one. Listen, I want you to go into a program and get clean. Why? It ain't like before. I'm just chipping now. That's exactly what I used to say. It ain't like that. I swear. I swear on Jimmy's soul, I swear. - Where's Eddie? - Oh, uh Listen to me, where is Eddie? Eddie? No, Eddie! Eddie, no! No, Eddie! Come on! Jesus, you swore! You son of a bitch! You swore on Jimmy's soul! You want this shit, huh? You want this shit?! Go ahead, go after it! Ryan, don't! Come on! You want it?! That shit Vincent will fucking kill me! Go ahead, go down after it! You want it? Don't! God damn it. No, don't! He's gonna fucking Eddie! Eddie, I'm sorry. I fucked up. I'm sorry. I fucked up with you and Jimmy. I'm sorry. I fucked up with you and Jimmy. I'm sorry. No, leave it. Leave it! - No! - Come on, get the fuck out. No, he'll kill us. No! Come on, we're getting the fuck outta here. - No! - We're getting the fuck outta here. Enough's enough. Doreen, get out. Get the fuck out. Get out! The fuck out! - You're fucked, Ryan. - You wanna fuck around? Come on, give me some, old man! - Oh yeah? - Give me some! Fuck you! Old man? I'll show you who's an old man. - Fuck you. - I'll fuck you. Let's go, out. Let's go! Out! Shoot me, old man. I'll show you old man. Come on, do it, you fucker. Go ahead. No more of this shit. No more! T ell fucking Vincent, you hear?! You can't come in here and fuck around with people's business. T ell him what I said, "Fuck him and fuck you!" Look at him, he's a big shot, huh? Come a long way. I owe it all to you, Sal. You put in the word, you brought me along. You're a good earner. And you got great taste in women. - Is he treating you okay? - Yeah, Sal. I mean, if there's anything you need, anything at all, you should give me a call, 'cause Vincent won't mind. You won't mind, will you, Vincenzo? What about me, Sal? There's plenty of me to go around, honey. Salut. What's wrong? Don't worry, I'll say goodbye to loverboy for you. No, you promised me. You promised me. Sal, I'm sorry, I gotta go. Something just came up. - Can't it wait? - No, the natives are restless. You know how it is. It's a little street thing but I gotta take care of it personally. Oh. The personal touch always works. - Put Carla in a cab for me? - Absolutely. Go ahead. You take care of your little street thing, okay? And make sure it don't interfere with business, because you know how I feel about that. And Vincenzo you be careful, 'cause you never know who's behind things. Look before you leap. You understand? Ryan, we ain't eight years old, and this ain't the playground. Ain't gonna be little Tommy Murphy coming through that door. Why don't you get outta here? I don't want you here! - Go, leave! - I'm not leaving without you. Come on with that bullshit look. I can deal with Vincent. - Just let me handle it - I'm fed up with your shit! God damn it, we can make up a story. - No more stories! - Let me damn it! Vincent, Ryan's sorry You fucking prick, get over there! - Don't touch him! - Take this Irish bitch with you. And shut her the fuck up! I hear one sound from either of you then you'll be next. You understand? Not a word. Not a sound. Just watch. You like it when people watch? Let's give them a show. Motherfucker. This is gonna be fun, Ryan. Eddie and me are walking outta here or you can kill us. Either way, we're free of this game. You want a fucking game? I'll give you a game. Mitch. I'm not gonna let you leave... I'm not gonna let you die... No... I'm gonna teach you once and for all not to touch... what I own. Vincent, don't do it. Carla, it has nothing to do with you. - Listen to me. - Get outta here, Carla. No, we made a deal. I'm yours. And I've given you everything I have. And I've given it only to you. But if you do this thing, if you touch him with that, then you'll have broken your word to me, and we will have nothing. Is that what you want, Vincent? Is that what you want? Or do you just want me? Just me, giving you everything that I have? H ey, what about Eddie? H e's still mine. I want him back out on the street. Get the fuck out of here. So what did you expect? Did you think that things would really be different? No. Once that shit gets underneath your skin, once it runs through your veins and gets inside your head, it never lets you go. It waits, until you hurt inside, until you are really needy and confused, and then it whispers to you. Oh God. Jimmy thought he'd kicked it. So many times he thought he was free. But then something would happen, some thing that would make him listen to that voice inside his head. And I'd come home, and I'd find him laying there on the floor, rolled up in a little ball, sometimes the needle would still be in his arm. And I'd wait... I'd wait for him to come down. And then I'd just hold him. I'd just rock him like a little baby. And then he'd cry and he'd beg me to forgive him and swear that it was the last time, but it never was. Because that shit was inside of him hidden in his mind, waiting, whispering. (rumbling) Look, Ryan, that voice is still inside Eddie and it's still inside you. I know you think about it, about getting high. Just one little taste, one last time. Jimmy used to feel that way. He'd fight it. Then he'd wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat. How do you sleep, Ryan? How are your nights? Does it whisper to you in your dreams? Get out... Ryan. Get the fuck out. Otherwise you're gonna end up dead in some alley or on some rooftop, or right under Hellgate Bridge just like your brother. Father, I just really... wanted to talk to someone. I'm listening. I'm not sure anymore about what's right or what to do. I have these feelings, but, uh I gotta do something. Why do you have to do something? Because every everyone that I that I love is in pain. You blame yourself? Y eah. Do they blame you? They- they- they say that they don't but I- they have to. And that's what hurts you the most? It's not my hurt that- that concerns me. Then what is your confusion? If I stay here, it may cause them more trouble, but if I go, I can't live with what might happen. Why have you come here? I told you. I needed to talk. It sounds like the ones you love are the ones you need to talk to, to work things out. What if they won't listen? Well, at least you would've tried. There's no good way out of this. Sometimes we have to choose the lesser of two evils. We all have to face that. Hi- hi, it's me. Vincent could've killed you. You gotta get away from this. If I could do it, if I could get you and the kid outta here, would you go? Ryan... I've given my word. And besides... I'm his wife now. - You weren't always. - No, I wasn't. But that was a long time ago. It's not that long. There are so many other things. It doesn't matter. None of that matters. I had to do things in prison to survive. Things happened to me too. Things I'm not proud of. And it almost destroyed me. But always... always I thought about you, and what happened between us. And sometimes, I would just imagine... us together just like we are now. I'd close my eyes and I could block it all out. But, Ryan, I have Tyler now. I have to think about him, about his well-being. And you just don't walk away from a guy like Vincent. Even Vincent wouldn't hurt his own kid. - Carla- - No! Don't you say it. Don't you fucking say it. Isn't this hard enough? I can't let all those feelings back in and then have to live like this. Carla, I love you. - No... no. - I love you. What? You and Mitch have a hard day at the office? Oh, you know me too well. Actually, I was... playing in a card game over at City Highland, and I started losing. And you know how I feel about losing. At the end, there was just three of us left in the game. So I took it easy. I watched every move they made. How they were playing their cards. How they were working the table. How they looked at each other. I just waited- until everyone was real relaxed... and at ease. And then... Tyler, come sit with Daddy. Come here, sporto. I love you. And then? Well, when you gamble, you gotta be ready for almost anything. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose. But that's what makes the game so exciting. The possibility that you could lose it all. Especially the one thing you love the most. But then, gamblers know that. Daddy, Mommy was trying to make me eat more meatloaf but I didn't want to. Mommy just wants to see you grow up to be big and strong, because Mommy loves you. And Mommy loves Daddy too. Don't you, Mommy? Don't you love Daddy? (knocking on door) Hold on. I said, hold on! Hold on. What do you want? Vincent wants to see you. What? Haven't the two of you had enough fun for one week? Well, Vincent's uh- very emotional, very sensitive. And I think this whole thing is getting way out of hand, so why don't you come down to the bar, have a few drinks, we straighten this whole thing out, and we'll be done with it? Straighten it out? Y eah. Vincent, he ain't a bad guy. Ryan, come in. Pour yourself a drink and have a seat. Make yourself at home. The night is young and love is in the air. Isn't that right, pussycat? Oh, Carla, this is Ryan. And Ryan, this is my wife- Carla. Why did you do this? Don't do this shit- Carla seemed to be missing the good old days so much, I thought I'd give her a little reminder. Mitch, make sure that Ryan is comfortable and see that he doesn't leave. And make sure he pays attention. Ryan, did you know that from time to time... my wife does me little favors? Little things to keep the relationship exciting. You know, games. Oh, it works wonders to rekindle the old passions, to spice up those long evenings. But then, I'm lucky. Because you have to admit that... even after all these years, my wife is still quite the looker. And having my child certainly hasn't hurt her figure. In fact, all this music, this dancing- this champagne- has put me in a very romantic mood. A very romantic mood. Don't you do it! Don't you fucking do it! Ryan, hasn't life taught you not to interfere between a husband... his wife... and the little games they play, huh? Don't you fucking do it! - Shut up. - No, Mitch, don't hurt him. Just make sure he pays attention. I'm sure that my wife's desire to demonstrate her undying love and devotion to me- will be painful enough for my good friend. Won't it, Ryan? No, don't look away, Ryan. Ryan- this is the best bit. You see, Ryan... she's mine. And always will be. Should anyone or anything try to change that... there'll be a lot more pain. It's up to you. You understand? Throw him out, Mitch. 24 hours a day, I want Louie keeping an eye on her. And I want everybody watching the streets for anything, anything at all. Consider it done. So... you want me to tap a little deeper into that private source of mine? - I'm kinda in the mood. - Sure, knock yourself out. - One more thing. - What? Get the word to Eddie that Mikey needs to see him. Why, what's going on? Oh, nothing new. - Ryan: God's damned me. - Father: What? H e's left me with no alternatives. Either way I turn, I'm damned. There are always alternatives. You're just confused. No, there's- there's no confusion. It's finally- it's clear to me. It's- it's what I'm gonna have to do. No, no, it's man's confusion that blows the will of God, man's separation from God's grace, and then he can't see the alternatives that faith and absolution can make very clear. But, Father, I'm only a man. I can only- I can only make choices as a man. I'm afraid- not for myself but for everyone else that I've put into this situation, that I've placed in pain. Ryan, you must have faith, you must believe. Will you pray for me, Father? Will you pray for my soul? Ryan, what is it, what happened? It's not what happened, it's just- it's what I've gotta do. Fast horses- they make you a lot of money. Speed- he finishes first, finishes first. This horse is slow. We don't want him. - This one's a pocket of gold. - Sweetheart, come here. Louie, I told you- stay away from my son. Sorry. I need your help. Please, there's no one else I can trust. - (phone rings) - Take this to him. Hello. Who is this? Who is this? Marsha: You're up to something. You getting high without me? What are you trying to cut me out of? No, it's just business. Look, maybe later, we should talk about some things. H ere. Take this, go back to the apartment. I'll meet you in a couple hours. Go-go-go-go. Go. I can't believe you're making a scene - with that junkie in my place. - I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry. I should have my head examined, you're too nickel-and-dime shit. - This is out of your league. - What? I can do this. Fuck this. After what your asshole brother pulled in here the other day, I gotta get somebody else to handle this. Maybe I can get Ralph or Frankie. No, no, come on, I'm your man. I do right on this, you tell Big Sal. I'll be there and back in under and hour and boom, you got play for the late night crowd, and you won't let Vincent down. All right. All right, but straight there and straight back, just pick up the package and get outta there. These are dangerous people. You fuck up, and nobody's gonna back you up on this. There's a lot of cash in this envelope. Don't fuck up. T rust me, Mike. T rust me. You want one? They're good. I guess not, huh? Mitch- it's time. - Mitch! - Yeah? T eressa, come on, T eressa, come on, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop! - Hmm? - Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop. Mitch: I'll take you to dinner tomorrow. Eddie? Doreen: Eddie? Vincent. Shit. Vinny, come on, Vinny! Get the fuck outta here, Vince-o. Eddie? Eddie? Eddie! Eddie! Eddie. Eddie... Ryan! Ryan! - Eddie. - What happened? He's been hurt bad. - What happened? - ... Me and my dope. Go upstairs. Eddie, sit up, sit up. - Can you walk? - I don't know. - Let me see. Let me see! - What am I gonna do? Eddie, you gotta go to the hospital. - No! Fuck- - All right, take it easy. - We'll put you in bed. - I'm scared, Ryan. Get upstairs. Easy. He's gonna kill me. He's gonna fucking kill me, Ryan. You know he never stops talking about you. He's got tons of stories about when you guys were little. You're his big brother. He actually told the whole neighborhood that someday you'd come back and take care of him and Jimmy. He actually believed that. For a while, at least. Some story, right? Yeah, some story. It's been tough on him with you gone. He just really sort of has me. And we have our problems, you know? Sometimes we get too fucked up and stuff. But at least we have each other. I'm glad you were there for him, Doreen. Eddie told me when you guys were little, it was you who first turned them on... You know? Got them both high. He said it was great. It's hard to shake once you've been in it for too long. It's lucky for you- you got out. Y eah, I was lucky. Wish I knew what he was doing out in Brooklyn. The only time he ever went out there was with Vincent. When they were doing some- well, you know- business. Once like... a month ago, and then last week- when Jimmy overdosed. Eddie was with Jimmy the day he died? Yeah. Eddie went with Vincent. He was gonna hook up with Jimmy. - Then they were coming here. - Doreen, this is important. Are you sure that was the day Jimmy died? Yes. I was waiting here for them. And then Eddie showed up alone and he seemed really worried about something. Then we both got high... and passed out. And later that night, we heard that Jimmy died. And it was just a whole fucked up day- and everything. Eddie didn't say anything about what he was doing tonight? No. He was just talking to Mike... and then I followed him out to Brooklyn. I'll be back in a little while. If anything happens to Eddie, call an ambulance or get him to a hospital. Okay? Okay. But where are you going? To watch out for my little brother. Salvadore. Charlie. How's Uncle Dominic? He's getting old. But we're all getting old. It feels like rain. Maybe you can put in a good word. There are some things that are simply out of our hands- and there are some things that aren't. That's why you've come, isn't it? Your man, he's out of control. Come inside, we'll talk. Hey... don't start that shit. Hey, we're closed. You hear me? We are closed, come back tomorrow. Look who it is. What the fuck do you want? It's all right, Mitch. I'm sure Ryan is just looking for a little action. After all, this is the best game in town. I think it's time for me to take a leak. I'll be right back. You just missed a group of nice Latino gentlemen who were here looking for Eddie. Apparently he was a very bad boy tonight. Very bad. Not only did he rip off a kilo of their pure heroin, but he put quite a few holes in a number of their most-valued employees, huh? And you know how hard it is to get good help these days. But the best part is that he stole 60 Gs from me. 60,000 of my hard-earned money, so he's suddenly very popular. We both know Eddie didn't rip anybody off. You'd be surprised at what some people will do for that much money and drugs. I mean, do you even know what 60,000 and a kilo looks like, huh? He doesn't have a clue. He doesn't know his ass from his elbow. Go around behind the bar. Go on, Mitch won't bite you. Go on, take a look. Take a look in the ice maker. Latinos aren't stupid. They'll figure this out. Maybe I'll point 'em in the right direction. I think it's a little too late for that. They're probably over there right now, sort of- working things out. Go on, call him up. Call him up, asshole. You see, Eddie's probably entertaining guests right now. And you know how those Latinos love to party, huh? (growling) I know you're hit. I just don't know if you're alive. Fuck you. Good. Good, you're still there. That's more than I can say for poor Mitch. Vincent: Mike? Mike, are you all right? Mike: I'm all right. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Listen to me, go get Sal, bring him here so he can take care of this little situation. Then we'll pay Eddie a visit, see if he's still in one piece. Mike: Vincent? Vincent! Mike, just go. Just go, do what I tell you. Looks like we got ourselves a little Mexican stand-off here. You're hit. I'm hit. And you got a gun, I got a gun. I can't get at you and you can't get at me. I think there's three things you're missing. What's that, pretty boy? First of all, I think you're hurt a lot worse than I am. In fact, I think you're bleeding to death. You can't get to your feet, otherwise you'd have been over the top of this bar already. And what's number two? I got your kilo and 60 grand. Y eah sure, till Sal gets here. And what's three? I got a telephone. Oh, great. Let's order some pizza, huh? How many we're gonna get for 60,000, you dumb fuck? Carla, it's me. Carla, hang up the phone! Yeah, he's here. You wanna talk to him? - Vinny, wanna talk to Carla? - Fuck you. Vinny's in one of his moods. I'll tell you. I'll tell you- I'll tell you I love you. I love you. Yeah. What's your answer? I know, baby, so am I. So am I. Come on now. Go ahead, you- you tell me. You hear that, you asshole, she loves me. Now listen you- you wake up- wake up Tyler and- and take nothing. You just- put on your coats and you get in a cab and meet me on the corner of Eddie's block, understand? Vincent: I'll fucking kill you. I'll kill you both. I'll find you. And then I'll kill you. I'll kill all... I'll kill both of you. I could kill you right where you lay. You better do it. You better fucking do it. Pray to God that I don't get up off this floor, Ryan. You better go to that priest, and pray to him that I don't get up. You know, next time I see Father, I am gonna thank him- because he told me some things. He told me all about you- and Eddie and Jimmy- and some things about Carla you don't even know. That's when I realized there's only two things I owe you. One... thanks for taking care of my son. And number two- Eddie. Oh, Jesus, Eddie. Oh, Eddie. I gotta call a hospital. I gotta get you an ambulance. Doreen. Where's Doreen? It's all right. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about Doreen. Gotta talk to you about Jimmy. Eddie, it's all right. Don't worry about Jimmy now. I did it to him. I did it. I know, Eddie. I know. I give him that shit. I knew it was poisoned. I told him not to do it. I went out to cop something good. But then Doreen and I... got high and I forgot him. I forgot Jimmy. I killed him. I killed Jimmy. I gotta call you an ambulance. Ryan, don't leave me. Please- They broke the phone. I gotta go outside. I gotta get you to a hospital, make the call. You should've been watching out for me. - You should've been here. - I'm gonna make one call. Don't worry. I'll be right back. - Don't worry. - I'm ready, Ryan. Help me up. I'm gonna go. I'm ready. I'm scared. I'm so scared. It's Eddie, he's upstairs. He's hurt real bad. - I gotta get him to the hospital. - I'll go with you. No, I'm not sure about Sal. He could show up. - You gotta go. - What about Vincent? H ere. H ere. What is this? That'll keep you going till you get settled somewhere. What are you talking about? - You're coming, aren't you? - Yeah. Now there's a bus leaving for Miami. I want you to go to the Ocean View Hotel, okay? You'll be safe there. Is my daddy coming with us? No, uh... your daddy can't come with you- right now. Your daddy loves you, though. Your daddy loves you very, very much. You promise you'll meet us? Port Authority, okay? They got a bus to catch. Mommy, who was that man? Come on. Eddie? Eddie, come on! I'll take you down- to the stairs... Eddie? Eddie, come on. No, Eddie, come on, wake up. Eddie, Eddie. Come on, Eddie, please- Please, Eddie. Come on, Eddie, wake up for me. Please, wake up for me, please. Come on, I told you I'd come back. Come on. I told you I'd come back, you son of a bitch. Come on, wake up. I'll do anything, you son of a bitch! Fuck! I can't stop you. You have to make that decision for yourself. But I lost you once and I don't wanna lose you again. Oh God. No! He's dead, Sal. Vincent's dead, shot right through the head, point blank. Should we go after Ryan? What should we do, Sal? Peanuts always make me thirsty. - They do that to you, Mike? - Come on, Sal. This whole thing with Vincent and Ryan- shouldn't we get even for Vincent? Shouldn't we do something? No. This one, we leave alone.
