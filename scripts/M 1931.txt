Always that awful song Just you wait a little while, The nasty man in black will come What's the matter? l told those kids to stop singing that awful song But they keep singing it over and over As if we haven't heard enough of that murderer Oh, leave them be lf they're singing, at least we know they're okay Yes, l guess you're right WHO lS THE MURDERER? Since June 11, little KLAUS KLAWlTZKY and his sister KLARA have disappeared Evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a similar crime committed last fall against the DOERlNG sisters What a pretty ball! What's your name? Elsie Beckmann Did Elsie come with you? No, she didn't Thank you A thrilling new chapter! Passionate, moving, sensational Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke -Tell me, Mr. Gehrke. -Yes? Have you seen Elsie? Didn't she just come up the stairs? No, she isn't here yet She won't be long now. Good-bye, Mrs. Beckmann Good-bye, Mr. Gehrke Extra! Extra! Extra! New crime! Who is the murderer? Because the police have not published my first letter l am writing today directly to the NEWSPAPERS Continue your investigations Everything will happen just as l have told you. But l have not yet finished Who is the murderer? Christ! Here we go again. lt's horrible The lettering is too small We can't read it Hey, you, read it out loud -''The unknown murderer''. -Let him read! Hey! Quiet! ''The terror in our town has found a new...'' Certain evidence leads us to believe that the murderer is the same one who has already killed eight children We must remind you again that a mother's first duty is to guard her children from the danger which always threatens Also, the danger is often hidden in some attractive bait Candy, a toy, and fruit can be the murderer's weapons True, true! Come on! Come on! Read, read on Okay, okay. ''The anxiety of the general public is very high because the police have not yet completed their investigations But the police are faced with an almost impossible problem.'' ''The criminal has left no clue. Who is the murderer?'' What is he like? Where is he hiding? No one knows. Still, he is one of us ls it your neighbor? Yes, that's right Why look at me when you say that? -You know very well. -What do l know very well? -Think about it. -What are you saying? l saw you go up those stairs behind that little girl What?! You are crazy, you dirty swine! Who's a swine? Me? Or a man who chases little girls? You bastard! You swine! Murderer! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! l'll see you in court. l'll see you in court Now, now, gentlemen! Calm down! Slanderer! Trying to ruin my reputation Slanderer! Terrible man! The police listen to him! They're searching my house! How awful! What a shame! Searching a man's house because of an anonymous letter Mr. Jager, calm down! We're only doing our job When we are so upset? Scared about the children Look, that's why the police must follow every clue Any man in the street could be the guilty one Can you please tell me what time it is? Yes, my child Now, my child, go home. Where do you live? What's it to you where the kid lives? Why were you bothering that kid? But - but - l did nothing! What do you want with me? Just you wait and see Let me go! lt's an outrage! -What's going on? -lt's an outrage! What does he want? Don't get so excited Punch him in the face! -Bothering children. -Acting like a big shot! Let me go! l did nothing! You wanted to get her alone, didn't you? Yes, then kill her like all the others, right? lt's the murderer! lt's him! Hold him! Call the police! No police around when you need them. Officer, officer! Move along please, move along now. Don't block! You can catch pickpockets but you'd better get the murderer What? ls he the murderer? Move along now. Come on, get a move on MURDERER WRlTES TO NEWSPAPERS lt's a terrible scandal This will have a bad effect on public opinion, lnspector. lt's very serious But, sir, we cannot stop the murderer from writing letters! This man is a mental case He gets a kick from seeing himself in the papers We immediately got in touch with the newspaper They sent us the original letter. The lab is working on it Of course, you can't get good fingerprints from a postcard which went through so many hands We'll compare the results with our archives We must try everything to find a clue or a lead Then, we'll send the letter to the graphologist The very particular shape of the letters... do you follow me? indicates in this man a very strong and pathological sexuality Some of the broken letters reveal an actor's personality which can be indolent or even lazy ln the whole, the handwriting shows clear signs of insanity Yes, lnspector, certainly. You and your men are very good But, nevertheless, results, we must have results Results! Minister, my men are only getting 12 hours sleep a week as well as searches on the spot, Minister They start their shift already tired Don't forget, this job is nervously trying especially when the success rate is so low The homicide officers work restlessly They're always on alert following any clue, even the slightest one that may lead us to our man Minister, consider their findings on the scene of the crime We find, for instance, behind a hedge a little white paper bag Clearly it held the candy ln a corner, we found some crumbs and some sugar grains Within a radius of 2 kilometers, we have searched in all the candy shops to find out where the bag came from But in vain Every day the search widens but, of course, no one remembers anything Nevertheless, we keep on searching, getting nowhere without much hope of finding a solution. Our men... What good is that? l know you're trying but an unknown murderer terrorizes the town A town of four million and your police are failing Minister, you don't seem to understand the difficulties Only on the way home of the missing child we got fifteen different testimonies Just listen: ''Testimony 1478 in the Beckmann murder case...'' -You know nothing. -More than you, Sir! Gentlemen! Can't you agree what color hat that little girl wore when you saw her? Of course, lnspector, it was red -lnspector, it was green. -lt was a red hat! lt was a green hat! Stop! lt's hopeless. Thank you, gentlemen -Next witness. -Of course, lnspector if you listen to a color-blind man! The police have investigated over 1,500 clues Documents fill 60 volumes. We have all available men We have systematically combed all adjoining areas Every thicket, every piece of undergrowth, every bush in every hole, we might find something We sent out police dogs. The best trackers are on the scent to no avail. Since the murderer's first crime police have inspected all the flop-houses every night and checked the identity of every vagrant Such measures hurt our popularity and make people nervous But we watch all railway stations and raid the underworld hangouts Despite all this, the police haven't succeeded in finding anything The police. Get back! Let me go, you dirty bastard! Let me go! Please let me go, won't you? You son of a bitch! Let go! Let her go, you filthy pig! Quiet! Quiet! The head cop! Quiet! You'd like that, wouldn't you? Police orders: nobody leaves. Get your papers ready Quiet! C'mon kids, let's not be stupid lt's Fatty Lohmann! Loh-mann, Loh-mann, Loh-mann! Loh-mann! Loh-mann! Quiet! Quiet! You'll wear yourselves out lt would be better if you got the murderer Yes! Much better! Quiet! Be reasonable! Spread out. All of you spread out. C'mon, papers out! -l haven't got any. -Show me your papers Please let me go, lnspector Show me your papers -l think we know each other. -Yes, we do To the headquarters! With all this mess, not a client! Don't make any trouble. No papers and you go to headquarters l am innocent Don't talk nonsense Quiet! Show me your papers Don't push. lt's everybody's turn -Have you got your papers? -l can't go around with my birth certificate. That's asking too much -Don't mess with me. -That's asking too much, lnspector Headquarters for you Look here, it's disgusting Poor workmanship, old boy. You've had it. To headquarters Better luck next time, Willie Shut your face! Next Fancy boy What's wrong? Pop Lohmann's got him ''Unsolved burglary at a fur shop.'' Well, l guess l'd better take you down to headquarters But... my papers are in order Next No luck, huh? Papers l have none Headquarters No luck Next, come on, let's go This is wrecking our business, Sarge, trouble every night You can't have ten minutes peace anymore. Give us a break! lt's no joke for us either, out every night Of course, but you're drivin' away my clientele and the guy you're looking for ain't here Do you know how mad everyone is about this guy who's causing a raid every night? 'Specially the girls. Sure, they solicit but believe me, everyone is a little mother at heart l know a lot of crooks, get sort of tender when they see kids lf they catch that bastard they'll wring his neck Ready to go, Sarge? Good night So it's the Crocodile tonight. Two loads for the nick What's keeping Schranker? ls it three o'clock yet? l'll find out Hello, the exact time, please. Two minutes to three Thank you There are more police on the street tonight than whores Wherever you spit, cops Even when you've got a broad, they don't leave you alone They've gone nuts. All they think about is the murderer l have a little six-year-old and every night l have to look under the bed and in the closet to see if the murderer is hiding there You can't even do your job. The police are everywhere There's no privacy anymore. l'm fed up with it Tell us something new What's keeping Schranker? Maybe he's been caught Not him. He did a bank job in London. Scotland Yard trapped him There he was, hands up, back to the wall, millions of cops around two seconds later there were two corpses and he'd beat it! The best man between Berlin and San Francisco Six years they've looked and they haven't caught him yet Haven't caught him yet, but dogs can kill wolves Shut up The suspense is killing me. He's always right on time God be praised! At last! Well, hello! You've finally come. Good afternoon Are you crazy? Close the curtains Gentlemen, the meeting can now begin According to regulations, l confirm that the leadership of every organization in our union is represented l assume you are all authorized to vote on behalf of your members Good. Let's not be held up by procedure We all know why we are here. Some non-member is screwing up our affairs. Daily raids by the police for the child murderer interfere with our business. We can't put up with this pressure any longer in every hotel, cafe or pad This state of affairs must not be allowed to continue We have to put things right again or we'll all be ruined Our funds are exhausted. We'll have to use money allocated for our colleagues' wives who are being ''hosted'' by the state Furthermore, our reputation is suffering Gentlemen, the cops are looking for the murderer in our ranks! When l run into a cop while on business, he knows the risk and so do l. lf one of us dies, OK, that's a risk one takes lt can happen. But you and l are not on the level of this murderer Absolutely! We are doing our job, we have to make a living But this monster has no right to live. He must disappear! He must be eliminated, without pity, without scruples Gentlemen, our members have to carry on normal business without being handicapped by nervous policemen l ask you for advice l suggest a closer watch on lD cards, systematic searches and police raids. More raids, and much tougher ones Spies. We need spies among the police to give us warnings The girls must take a little more notice of the cops We get into trouble because one of the girls has talked too much to her cop boyfriend. Now the girls have to tell us what gives We must be allowed to search any house, apartment, back yard in order to find a clue We have contacts, we have to make a statement to the press we have to tell them that we condemn the bastard too We should make it known that he isn't in the underworld l'm sure it's a man who looks like he wouldn't hurt a fly ln his normal state, he might even play marbles with the kids or cards with his wife. Otherwise, murderers like Grossmann or Haarmann couldn't live for years like they did without their neighbors suspecting them at all We have to get that across to the public. They must help Don't talk to me about the public helping. lt disgusts me just to hear them talk. Excuse me, Chief! But it's the truth. Christ! Help from the public brings no clues! Just a pile of letters with the most incredible accusations! Quite true Calls to the police the moment a garbage man crosses a yard! But when we need accurate information, they can't remember! They've seen nothing. That's help from the public for you You're exaggerating a little, Lohmann No, he isn't Most of the people don't feel concerned The majority of them doesn't realize that a child disappearance is also their problem l've got an idea! Let's get one of those guys, a telepath one who finds handkerchiefs and pocketbooks that have been hidden l don't think the reward is enough Chief, we have to offer a real fortune for the murderer None of this is getting us anywhere -That won't do any good. -What's your idea? Well, we just can't wait until the police decide to arrest the fellow The difficulty in solving crimes like this comes from the fact that the criminal and the victim are connected only by chance An instantaneous impulse is the killer's only motive We find the victim, we identify him, then we find out when he was last seen. Then, nothing more Children disappear and you know what state we find them in if we find them And the killer... as we know, in this kind of crime never leaves a mark behind This is what makes our job so hard and our success so rare The police have been looking for eight months Now, they'll catch him only by luck -We can't wait for that. -We'll be ruined before then Then what will we do? We'll have to catch him ourselves Yes! We must. That's it There is still one possible way! The guilty man must have a record somewhere. A man that disturbed must have come upon the law before. We've got to contact every clinic every prison, every asylum. We'll have to make inquiries about everyone freed as harmless but with the same pathological condition as the killer Every square foot must be permanently watched From now on, no child takes a step without us being warned OK, but how do we do it? There must be people who can go everywhere, not be noticed who can follow children without arousing suspicion who can follow children right up to their front doors People no one would suspect But who? People like that don't exist. Who could do it? Who? The beggars. The beggars' union can do it -Sausage going up. -God! This cheese smells good That finishes you Stop snoring! You'll wake up the lice Now we must take the back yards Yes, from number 1 to 88 Next You are responsible for the courtyards in every block, 1 to 88 Right! -What's next? -89 to 196 High Street What's your union number? There you are, Emil. Maybe you'll win 15,000 Touch wood! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen Thank you ''When searching homes, we must look for any clue which could establish where the murderer's letter to the papers originated lf there is an old wooden table, if there is a red pencil or writing paper of the same type. lnquiries must be discreet.'' ldiot And here's a list of mental patients who have been let out as cured or harmless in the last five years Reports from every institute, private and public And that's a list of their present addresses Good morning Does a Mr. Beckert live here? What? Does Mr. Beckert live here? l'm afraid l can't hear you. l'm a bit hard of hearing As if l couldn't tell. Does Mr. Beckert live here? Oh, Mr. Beckert... Yes... But he has just gone out Too bad, l wanted to see him l'm from the lncome Tax office Oh, good God! Tax people? Would you like to wait?

Get me the file on the Marga Perl murder. Hurry Thank you very much That's funny. l've heard that before lt was... it was... Hey! Henry! What is it? Listen a moment. Someone whistling. Can you hear him? There He's just stopped. Did you see him, the guy who was whistling? -Yes, l can still see him. -Yes? Yes. He's talking to a little girl and walking her down the street -After him and don't let him go! -But why? The day Elsie Beckmann was killed, someone bought a balloon He was with a little girl and he whistled just like that! Damn it, man! Are you crazy throwing peels on the ground? l might have broken my neck! Unbelievable l should report you to the police, you're a menace to the public Uncle There! That's it. They found three cigarettes butts at the scene of the crime. Aristons! Yes, the cigarettes are the same, but there's no old wooden table Of course, he could have written that letter somewhere else Heavens, the windowsill! You're right Just a minute A red pencil! God, at last we're getting somewhere Yes, yes, what? They have his trial! -Have they found him? -The beggars found him -He was talking to a little girl. -They put a mark on him Can't you be quiet? What's that? They are following the sign. He isn't out of sight for a second He's being watched -Uncle. -What is it? You're all dirty Where? There, on your shoulder Here, l'll wipe it off -What's the matter? -Come on, let's go He hasn't come out yet or we would have seen him He must be in the courtyard, he didn't come out this way He must be somewhere Maybe he's hiding inside the building Closing time! He mustn't get out with everyone leaving Christ! Here come the first ones already Let's go out in the street Keep a sharp lookout Turn off the light or he'll suspect something when he comes back What time is it? Nearly 6:30 He must still be in the building, anyway, he didn't come out Ok, Ok, yes... No, just a moment The beggars have gone for more help to search the whole area The murderer must still be in the building What sort of place is it? Nothing but offices. l don't know what's in the cellar There's a branch of the savings bank on the ground floor and from the first to the fifth, nothing but offices above that are lofts Look at that. lt ain't possible Anyone there? Anyone there? What next? Anyone there? Damn carelessness, all that trouble for one door Yes, good Looks like that guy is really cornered now l think we should tip off the cops right away -l agree. -Now then, listen carefully Hello. Just a moment. What? Ok, call me right back What is it? What's the matter? Are you crazy or something? The police? No. We're going to get that guy ourselves Listen... now, the time is Good. Then at 9:00, 10:00, 11:00! Good evening. Did you know your gates are not closed? What? But that's impossible! l've only just... But it is Open up, and no noise! Are you going to open up? Come on, get it open Get a move on! How many watchmen are there in the building? Ok, so you don't want to answer? There are two watchmen on their rounds Bloody hell! Damn it Shit! Careful with the lights. And don't walk like elephants -What's the story? -He isn't in the basement. We went through it and found nothing Friede and Auguste are still going through the boiler rooms Wait That's the last one Go up and join Emile. He needs help Go on, get a move on! Schranker sent me Good. Listen carefully lt's a new type of time switch Here's a general plan here. lf the time switches aren't set they automatically go off at the nearest police station. Get it? Have you got it? What do you think l am, some kind of a nut? -He isn't in the boiler room. -Fine We moved all the coal Are you nuts? What if the door is wired up? Want to get the police here? Well, we have to get in if we're going to search the whole place But not by the door, you ass! Use the office on the floor above Go through the ceiling Right, let's go Hey! What's up? Hey! Answer me. What's happening? Paul - tell us What's going on? l heard some banging! -What did you say? -What's the hurry? l must see Schranker! He's in the attic! l heard him knocking. He's in the attic! Keep quiet Get on with it, then He must be there There's the switch Force the locks Come on. Hurry up! l've got him. He's in the attic l heard someone hammer l told Schranker immediately He's up there with 8 men. They'll get him any moment l just came down to tell you lf l hadn't been alert, we'd have looked for him for hours Look out! The watchman! Let's get out of here! The cops will be here any moment. The watchman rung in Let's get out of here! Stop! Quiet! We've got compartments to search. Carry on. Get on with it. Only hurry! Out of the way. You can't do it that way He's not in here Next door! Come on. Quicker Not here either Come on, keep it up! Next door Quick! We've only got about 3 minutes left Hurry up! Quickly! This one hasn't got a padlock, he must be here.

Hurry up, quickly! Christ! Get out while you can, you fool! -Anybody left? -A few up top, they're on the way No reason for you to wait for them. With or without that guy lt doesn't matter, get away. What are they up to? Christ! Bloody hell! At last! Thank God! Hey! He's not down here. Who's pulled up the ladder? Who's pulled up the ladder? Bunch of morons Hello Hands up How can l put my hands up when l'm trying to hang onto the ladder? Get out of there For once, l'm innocent As a newborn babe This will surprise you, Franz, but l believe you Well, then everything is in order. l can leave then One minute Cigarette? Oh, boy l'll take your word for it On condition you tell me who was the man you were looking for and found there? l don't understand, lnspector. A man, you said? l know nothing about that. There must be some mistake l know nothing, nothing at all Of course. Only l don't understand why you are covering up for the gang who left you in the lurch. Funny friends! Leaving you right in it and running off. Bah! That won't wash with me, lnspector After all, l'm not risking very much Maybe a little bit of damage. But nothing was stolen Of course, something was stolen. ln fact, a good deal What? Stolen? How much? lf you talk, l'll tell you l've already told you, l don't know anything All right. Well, think about it. lt's amazing what one remembers when one is left alone for an hour or two Take him away! Send the night watchman in here Get the watchman Damowitz Sit down Now then, you said in your statement - Listen carefully You may have to repeat it under oath You clearly heard one of the burglars say to another, ''we've found him l've discovered the guy. He's in the attic.'' ls that correct? Yes, lnspector. Yes, l'll swear to whatever you want Right. You may go home now. But please be ready to testify Of course, lnspector. Good day, lnspector Tell me, is lnspector Lohmann in the building? He's talking to someone? No, it doesn't matter. l'll come up What? Good. Hasn't come in yet. You're watching Mrs. Winkler? Come in We've surrounded the whole block lf he wanted to get home, he'd run into us Now you have to wait l'll be in my office if you have some news Hell... What do you want? l wanted to ask you a favor Disgusting l wanted to ask you Anyway, read a bit of that -Reports? -Yes Burglary in an office block Bennostrasse? That's a very quiet neighborhood Perhaps it's not as quiet as all that Hell, this is becoming serious Did they intend to empty the whole place, then? What can they have been looking for in the coal? Look at that. lt's incredible Good Lord! This is madness! Ah, now it makes sense. They were after the safe Good God! What's it all about? l don't understand it at all They haven't even attacked that one. Are they all crazy? Well, l'll be damned! Well, what have you got to say? Nothing stolen, but a man taken Fantastic! And Franz the burglar was arrested. lsn't talking Frightened, evidently. Actually, l know him well He's one who'd rather jump from the fifth floor than get mixed up in a murder Could we set a trap for him? Could you help me, Lohmann? l see what you're getting at Let's take a look at this Franz You're wanted for questioning What? Four people for me? Come on The murder squad? lnspector Karl Lohmann What do you want with me? What's the murder squad want? Yes, old boy, your case has been passed over to me now But why? What for? You did your work a little too well One of the watchmen Dead? Planning and assisting with a murder. lt's a bad show, Franz l can't go on with it. l don't want to have anything to do with it l'll tell you everything, everything l know Very wise, but unfortunately too late lnspector, it can't be too late... Please, lnspector lt isn't possible! Listen, l'm going to tell you everything Even who we were looking for in that damn building Well, then The child murderer What? What? Who? The child murderer, lnspector Wait This had to happen to me! Of all people Sit down Now, we're going to have a little talk lf you want to, lnspector And mind you, don't lie. OK, let's start What have you do to with the murderer, and where'd you take him? Well, lnspector, you know the old distillery of Kuntz and Levy? -The one that went bankrupt? -Yes. Since then the building's been abandoned and nobody cares What do you want with me? Let me go! Let me go! l've done nothing to you, let me go, you swine! Let me go! What do you bastards want with me? What do you want? Help! Help! Let me go. l want to get out. Get me out of here Let me out! You will not get out of here But gentlemen, l don't even know what you want me for l beg you, set me free. There must be some mistake No, no. No mistake. lmpossible. There's no mistake No mistake Do you recognize it? lt's a balloon like the one you gave little Elsie Beckmann! A balloon like that Where did you bury little Martha? But l never... l never even knew her You never knew her? And what about this one? And this one? You didn't know this one either, huh? Stop him, stop him... Don't let him get away Let me go! You have no right to treat me this way! We'll show you what right we have! You have no right to hold me here Right? Someone like you has no rights. Kill him! Yes, kill him! We must treat him like a mad dog. Crush him! You talk of rights. You will get your rights We are all law experts here from 6 weeks in Tegel prison to 15 years in Brandenburg You will get your rights, you will even get a lawyer Everything will be done according to the rule of law A lawyer? A lawyer? l don't need a lawyer Who is accusing me? You, maybe? You? Just a moment. lf l were you, sir, l'd keep quiet Your life's at stake, in case you didn't know it Who are you? l have the dubious honor of being your defense counsel But l'm afraid it won't be much use to you But, but... Do you want to kill me? Murder me, just like that? We just want to render you harmless But you'll only be that way when you are dead But if you kill me, it'll be cold-blooded murder! l demand that you hand me over to the police l demand to be handed over to the jurisdiction of common law That would suit you, wouldn't it? Then you'll invoke paragraph 51 And spend the rest of your life in an institution at state expense And then you'd escape, or else get a pardon, then there you are, free as air, with a law-protected pass because of mental illness, off again, chasing little girls We're not going to let that happen We must make you powerless. You must disappear Yes, disappear! l can't help what l do l can't help it, l can't... The old story, we never can help it in court What do you know about it? Who are you anyway? Who are you? Criminals? Are you proud of yourselves? Proud of breaking safes or cheating at cards? Things you could just as well keep your fingers off You wouldn't need to do all that if you'd learn a proper trade or if you'd work. lf you weren't a bunch of lazy bastards But l... l can't help myself! l have no control over this this evil thing inside me, the fire, the voices, the torment! You mean to say that you have to murder? lt's there all the time, driving me out to wander the streets following me, silently, but l can feel it there lt's me, pursuing myself l want to escape, to escape from myself! But it's impossible l can't escape. l have to obey it. l have to run... endless streets l want to escape, to get away And l'm pursued by ghosts. Ghosts of mothers And of those children... They never leave me They are there, always there... Always, except when l do it When l... Then l can't remember anything And afterwards l see those posters and read what l've done Did l do that? But l can't remember anything about it But who will believe me? Who knows what it's like to be me? How l'm forced to act... How l must... Must... Don't want to Must! Don't want to, but must! And then... a voice screams l can't bear to hear it l can't go on The accused has said that he cannot help himself That is to say, he has to murder. As this is the case he has pronounced his own death sentence Someone who admits to being a compulsive murderer should be snuffed out, like a candle This man must be wiped out, eliminated Perfect! Just what l think! l wish to speak The defense lawyer will speak Our very honorable president, who is, l believe, wanted by the police for three murders - That's got nothing to do with it ...claims that because my client acts under an irresistible impulse he is condemned to death He is right! He is mistaken. Because it is that very fact that clears him Just a minute, enough! Mad old drunk! ls this very obsession which makes my client not responsible And nobody can be punished for something he can't help -Ridiculous! -Do you suggest that this brute should get off? l mean this man is sick. A sick man should be handed over not to the executioner, but to the doctor Can you promise he'd be cured? What use are asylums, then? And what would happen if he escaped? Yes.

The asylum, then another escape or release Then the compulsion all over again, and so on, and on No one can kill a man who isn't responsible for his actions Not the state, and certainly not you The state must see that this man becomes harmless and no longer is a danger to his fellow citizens You've never had children, huh?

No pardon! -Give the murderer to us Kill the beast! -Crush the brute! -Kill him! Beat him! All that won't silence me l won't allow a crime to be committed in my presence l demand that this man... that this man be granted the protection of the law l demand that this man be handed over to the police -To the police! -Filthy stooge ln the name of the law ln the name of the people This won't bring back our children We, too, should keep a closer watch on our children
