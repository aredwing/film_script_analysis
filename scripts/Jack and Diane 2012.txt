So, how are you gonna get home? I don't know. Do you know how to get home? - Yea... - I have a Metro card if you want it. Yeah. Thanks. I'm cool from the subway. Okay. See you later today? - Yeah, totally. - Okay. Okay, I'll let you go. - Call me. - I will. Looking from a window above  It's like a story of love  Can you hear me?  Came back only yesterday  Moving further away  Want you near me  All I needed was the love you gave  All I needed for another day  And all I ever knew  Only you  Sometimes when I think of your name  And it's only a game...  Oh, my goodness. You... you came from nowhere. You're okay? Are you okay? I'm going to call an ambulance, okay? Hold on. She's okay. I'm sorry, you'll have to take another cab. No, man, she's standing. She doesn't need an ambulance. She'll be fine. Besides, it was her fault, man. I saw the whole thing. She doesn't have health insurance. She's just gonna wind up getting a huge hospital bill with a fucking ambulance. Give her 20 bucks. She'll be okay. Are you... are you okay? Diane? Is that you? Jesus Christ. - Where the hell have you been? - I'm peeing. Do you know how much trouble you're in, young lady? I'm peeing. Go away. Your brother used to wear a helmet. You can't ground me! You're not my mother! While you're here for the rest of the week, I can do whatever I want. No, it's just another six days of this hell. Fine! Glad you came to visit. Let's see if you ever come back. Does it hurt? No, it's just a scratch. Thanks. Hey, do you like sushi? I don't know. It's good. It's good with ketchup. Try it. Do you like it? I didn't like it either at first. Do you wanna spit it out? So, do you wanna see my room? Yeah, sure. Here, we can bring these. Hold on, I wanna show you something. I've... this... I've... I've never played this for anyone. It's just, like, this... cheesy song over and over. And, like... but... I... This was my brother's. I've been, like, saving it. I'm just gonna be lame and say it. This is something I wanted to share with the most special person in the world, and I always thought. I'd know that person when I found them. And... I've been, like, waiting. And I thought maybe... I don't know, I kinda think that that's you. Am I freaking you out? Okay. You wanna hear it? Okay, here. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I can fix it. Plus we have, like, a lot of time ahead of us. Right? That's cool. - Hey, you okay? - Fine. Why didn't you call last night? Sorry. I got in late. I met someone, though. I think you'd totally like her. I'm thinking... that I might not go away anymore. What are you talking about? Well, it was, like, your idea in the first place, and... I said no phone. - I'm on the phone to Karen. - Tell her you're grounded. Aunt Linda is so retarded. No wonder she doesn't have kids. - Give me that. - No, let me finish. One, two... Jeez, what'd you do? Okay, you have to do something for me. - You have to call Jack. - Jack? Yeah, she's my kind of girlfriend. I promised I'd call her tonight. - ...eight, nine... - No way. You're gonna really like her, and all you have to do is pretend to be me. But you can't tell her anything about me leaving. And there's this thing you have to do when you dial her number, 'cause I lost some of the digits. And when you're dialing, you have to guess. I think it was... Feel  What I feel  Feel  What I do  Feel  What I do  Going nowhere...  Jack? Jack! Jesus Christ. Phone. Hello? Hi. Is this Jack? Yeah. Diane? I thought you were gonna call me when you got home. Well... well, I just got home. You just got home? I thought you were late. Late for what? I don't know, you just, like, took off really fast. Yeah, I had a... I had, to run errands. What are you doing? I'm talking to you. I can't be that loud. I wish you were here. Yeah, me, too. Are you touching yourself? Excuse me? Let me be your hands. How does it feel? I'm not gay. - What? - I can't do this. - I've got to go. - Wait, don't go. It's cool. This isn't Diane. What are you talking about? Hey, girl. So, what do you want to do today? I have to do stuff here today. Cool. Well, I'll help you, and we can go. F... fuck. Why don't you girls sit down, and I'll make some sandwiches? Hilary, where's the 60 quid...  - You borrowed off me?  - Hey. You're gonna love this. - What is that? - It's Marmite and bagel. I'm not really hungry. It's killer, right? Hold on, though. It's better with tea. I'm sure it was you in the new Audi  Outside Sainsbury's  Hey, Hilary... Hilary  Hilary...  - Whose is this? - It's mine. Cool. Nice pick. So, Aunt Linda, tell me about Diane's sister. What's her name? Karen? Karen, she's a sweetheart. You know what they say... twins are opposites. Twins? Cool. I gotta pee. You wanna show me where the bathroom is? Dork. What did she say? Who, Karen? Oh, we had fun. - No, no, not here. - Come on. Diane, can you come give me a hand? I need to talk to you about something. Yeah, I'm just looking for some loo roll. We just bought loo roll. What are you doing? Oh, my God. Does Mary know? - Know what? - That you're... With girls? Yeah, of course she knows. She's my mom. - Well, nobody told me. - What are you, the library? People go to you to deposit information? - Jack, I don't think I like you. - Fine. I don't fuck older women. Well, Diane's grounded, so you're gonna have to leave. Well, we're gonna get a place together when I move out next month, so fuck you. Fine. But Diane will be at school in France in two weeks, so good luck finding her. Is that true? Stop! - Please, Jack, come on. - You're such a fucking liar. First you con your sister into talking to me, and now you're only here for, like, a week? What the fuck am I, your fucking tourist fuck? - No, it's not like that. - Thanks for making me look like an ass. It's not like that. It's not like what? - Are you staying? - I don't know. It's not completely up to me. Well, look, don't stay for me, okay? I'm, like, over it. I get all the pussy I want. You're such a... A what? Okay, Karen... she, like, thinks that I'm, like, always taking care of her, right? And I don't know. Maybe I am. But it's like I'm stronger than her or something. What is she, like, retarded? Okay, are you gonna let me explain? Yeah. I don't have all day, though. Well, Karen, like, filled out this application thing for me to go on this fashion exchange to a school in Paris next year so that we could be apart, because she's... I don't know, she's just got this thing where she thinks she's, like, holding me back or something. Does that make sense? Yeah, I guess. Can I have a piece? It's my last piece. Why do you have to be so mean? You just think you're the cat's pajamas, don't you? What the fuck does that mean? The bee's knees. Like you're so cool. You don't know me. This is scary for me. I thought you said that I was, like, the one. I should probably go. Do whatever you want. What time is it anyway? It's around 3:00. You want me to call you a cab? Yeah, you should probably do that. Why'd you come here tonight? I don't know. To hang out. Why don't you join the group?  It's better than being a party poop.  - Maybe there. - All right, all right. Hold on. Look at that. But then this nipple's really weird now. Okay, just let me be the artist, okay? Okay. - Wait, that one's glowing. - Shut up. No, and now that nipple has gone out of control. Okay, I'm working on it. It needs... the nipple just needs to be a little bit smaller. Okay, I'll get the nipple, all right? - And that one needs to be... - What the fuck is going on? I can maybe fix it, but I need one of those littler screwdrivers. Holy shit, is that Lance's tape? - Hey! - That is the fucking tape, isn't it? Isn't it? - Give it... - Oh, shit, it is. Give it back. - Bitch. - Come outside. That is the grossest thing in the world. What the fuck are you doing here? Nothing. You can't just hang out with my friends. Well, they're my friends, too. No, they're not. Yes, they are. Chris sells that shit to some creep on the Internet. But it wasn't even me. It's just my face. And you did it. Yeah, well, it's different. I mean, we're friends and he pays me. What the fuck's that? Fireballs. So? So we both put one in our mouth, and whoever keeps it in there the longest wins. Wins what? If you win, I'll leave. But if I win, I get to stay. You are so retarded. You're just scared you're gonna lose. Wait, we have to both do it at the same time. Well, you'd better hurry, then. Hey, can I put this here? Hey, you should use her. She's, like, bass drum madness and needs new friends. Really? Here. You should go audition for it. Yeah, we're having, like, auditions today. Okay. All right. See you later. Watch it, Jersey girl. What, you own the sidewalk now? Do you want some of this? You're a fucking asshole, you know that? Fuck, that bitch dogged me. My guy says she's already on the net, like, a couple days ago. - Oh, my God, Stacy! - Yeah. - Go get you some booze. - Nice, nice! Booze! Hold up. That's what I think. What the fuck is this? - I'm just gonna... - Hi. Dude, get her another beer. - What? - Another beer? - Thanks. - You're welcome. You okay? Hey, you okay? Hey, you like to party, baby? I don't know. I mean... do you... do you wanna go home? You ready to party? Are you ready for a ride or you wanna party? I mean, it's up to you, but you are not... She looks to me like she's ready to party. - Doesn't stay down. - No, it doesn't. Is she ready? Are you ready to party? You guys ready to party? How 'bout you? You guys ready to party over there? - Oh, yeah. - Maybe. Hey. How's it going, buddy? She ready for a shower? Almost. Can you see? Yeah, yeah, I got it on glow-in-the-dark. - You ready, man? - Yeah. - You gonna be ready? - It's close. I've been drinking, so I'm like, you know... Fuckin' focus, man. Take off her panties. I wanna see it. Oh, I can't see. What's going on? It's okay, baby. It's just a shower. No penetration. Oh, yeah. She likes it. You want a little cherry, baby? Wait, fuckhead. I didn't get a shot of it. Good night, Karen, cute little thing, you. - They just fucking raped her. - Oh, no, they didn't. It's one of those "real girl" things. You're supposed to, like, think it really happened, but it's fake. Supposed to, like, think it's all... real and shit. Diane, come on, open the door. For Christ's sake, Diane, tell her to go away. I wanna break up. We're not even going out. - You have to leave. - I need to tell you something. I love you. Okay. Bye. What did she say? She doesn't know what to call it. Was it her? Is she gonna call the police? No, she doesn't wanna do that. That's fucked. She should send those fuckers to prison. Yeah, she knows that. She just, like, doesn't wanna... you know, a friend was involved, so she doesn't wanna go through all that. And someone, like, told Karen that there's so much of that stuff on the web that if you just don't make a big deal about it, it'll go away. But if she, like, tries to do something about it, it will suddenly be everywhere. No, that's fucked. She should do something. I told her she could say it was me. What time did you say that gets in again, sorry? Okay, thank you. Should Aunt Linda go? I don't know. What's up? I think I'm gonna go home early and see Karen. Okay. You don't have to wait with me. No, it's cool. I have, like, nothing to do today. I... I'm really sorry I was being, like... you know. I wish I could make it up to you. I think it's really cool that you have a sister and you guys are, like, so close. Karen's really lucky. Do you know what time it is? Oh, shoot! Can I use your phone? I forgot to call Karen, and she hates surprises. Yeah. Thank you. We don't have to do anything. I just wanna come and be there with you. I don't know. Why? You always make me feel so selfish. Okay, bye. You okay? You'll, like, see your sister in a couple of days, right? Maybe she just... just wants some space and doesn't want all this pity on her. You know? 'Cause, like, pity sucks. Am I being an asshole? Do you wanna go back to your place? No, I'm okay. Are you sure? Yeah, it's just my stomach hurts. Do you have to take a shit? Try to do like I do and fart it out. Okay, here's the deal... walk behind me, but don't say anything to anybody. Just pretend we're, like, guests. Shit, you need your bathing suit. Why? 'Cause we're going swimming. Here? Yeah. Here, I brought yours. Wait, where did you get this? Aunt Linda's closet. No. No, I think she wants to return this. Here. Hurry up, put it on. We have to change in the elevator. No, I'm stuck in my belt. Can you please help me out? Thanks. Turn around again. Oh, my. Don't look at me. Actually, can you put me down? I really have to pee. You should pee in the pool. No, I don't wanna pee in the pool. Why? There's no one in here. Yeah, but I think that's disgusting. I don't care. - Well, okay. - All right. Wait, just come up. - Why? - Here, wait, just... - No, no, no. Stop it. - No, no. Please stop it. Please. I'm lying to you. I actually have to poo! Do you... do you wanna go out tonight? Are you sure? I thought you didn't wanna hang out with me. Yeah, well... I'm... this is gonna sound really selfish, but I'm glad you stayed. So, thanks. Fuck. What if what's-her-name comes home early? - She's gonna have a shit fit. - Oh, fuck that bitch. Damn, bitch, how long are you gonna be in there? One second! Just one more thing. Hi. You want a drink? Diane, I think you should come out. No, don't come in. Hold on a second. Diane, open this door right now. Aunt Linda, what are you doing home? I live here. You have a lot of explaining to do, young lady. Please don't come in right now. Here, Aunt Linda, drink this. Jesus Christ. What's this? It's a mix. Too strong for you? Does your mom know you drink? Yeah. How was your date? Didn't put out? - What's your problem? - Nothing. You just look like you needed some action. Diane, you'd better get out here right now! Jack? I need you to come in here. I need a hand with something. Just Jack. Diane, I'm losing my patience. Fuckin' A. What the hell's going on? I need you to help me finish. Finish what, killing yourself? Come on, girls, I've gotta pee. Hold on! Jesus Christ. What were you thinking? I don't know. I just wanted to do it for you. What were you using, a fork? - Please just finish it. - I can't. I don't know how. What? Don't you shave your legs? - Yeah, but that's different. - Just fix it! I'm gonna count to 10. Why don't you just have Aunt Linda do it? I... Aunt Linda, if we let you in, you promise you won't freak out? - No way. - Anything. I'm going to take a piss. Go pee in the gas station! Open up now. I more than like you. I just wanna, like, unzip my body and... put you in there. Like a sleeping bag? Tickles. These are cute. Where'd you get 'em? The Old Navy store, I think, in the boys' section. I haven't d... I haven't done this. Roll over. No, I don't wanna roll over. Come on, just roll over. What are you doing? Just relax. What are you doing? Just go at your own speed. - Does this feel good? - What? No, no! What are you... no! No, no, no. What is that? Just trying to figure out what you like. I just can't do this right now. Now, come on. Why are you so experienced? I don't know. I'm not. I've had some training. What, are you, like, some slut or something? I'm just gonna sleep on the couch. Diane? What time is it? I just had a dream that I ate you. That's nice. No, it wasn't like that. Your nose is bleeding. That's weird. I've been getting them all the time recently. I know, dorkness. That's why it's weird. I never get 'em. Can we sleep in more? Can I do something? Can I touch your nose with my toe? - No. - Why? Why do you wanna do that? I don't know. I just want to. Okay. Now I've done one, I have to do the other one to make it equal. Can we go in there? In here? Yeah. Why, are you religious? No, I just wanna see it. You wanna sit down? It's my last piece. Thanks. Can you tell me about your brother? Why? 'Cause I wanna know more about you. What, about the tape? It's obviously something that's really special to you. Well, I mean, like, I told you, he made it for his girlfriend before she went away or moved. And... it was like a sign... symbol of true love 'cause they heard it together the first time they met. Anyway, she... she left and she fell in love with somebody else. And so she sent it back. So then he went to his friend's house and... got a shotgun and blew his head off. Don't worry about the tape. I was being stupid about it. Can we go? This place gives me the creeps. Man. Hey. I... brought you a present. Can I open it now? Yeah. Go for it. It's so Karen... you can take pictures and send them to Karen when you... go away. I'm... I'm gonna go. Wait. I'm really bad at good-byes, so I'm just gonna go, okay? Well, can you help me get my bags down? I can't reach them. Yeah. Jesus, how'd these get up here? Stop. Fuck. You okay? Yeah. How are we gonna get outta here? I'm, like, really bad in the dark. - Hey. - What is that? - It's just my hand. - Please don't creep up on me. Diane. What is that? We can use this to find our way out. You're retarded. Stop. You're gonna waste all the film. Where are you? Thanks. Holy fuck, I think my nose is bleeding again. What is up with this? Hold on, I have to tie my shoe. Wait. Jack? Jack? I'm here. Jack? I don't want you to leave me. Diane? I called the car service. You want me to bring your bag downstairs? Does my breath smell? I made this for you. You can't wear it, but... and I'm really sorry it got dirty. Thanks. It's okay if you forget about me. What? I have to go to the bathroom. - Wait, can you hold it? - I don't wanna hold it. My bus is leaving in a minute. This... this sucks. Tough. I'm never gonna see you again. I just get this feeling and, like, I know I'm never gonna see you again. How can you say that? You don't understand. You have, like, so much in front of you. You have everything. And I'm, like, stuck here. I wish I'd never met you. You've, like, taken my insides and I'm, like, not myself anymore. And it's just... so evil. Just... go. Hey, girl. Diane, this arrived this morning for you. Looking from a window above  It's like a story of love  Can you hear me?  Came back only yesterday  Moving further away  Want you near me  All I needed was the love you gave  All I needed for another day  And all I ever knew  Only you  Sometimes when I think of your name  And it's only a game  And I need you  Listening to the words that you say  It's getting harder to stay  When I see you  All I needed was the love you gave  All I needed for another day  And all I ever knew  Only you...  All I needed was the love you gave  All I needed for another day  And all I ever knew  Only you  This is gonna take a long time  And I wonder what's mine  Can't take no more  Wonder if you'll understand  It's just a touch of your hand  Behind a closed door  All I needed was the love you gave  All I needed for another day  And all I ever knew  Only you.  I bleed  Like a pig  It's not  So unusual  It might  Seem strange  But I'll always  Believe in girls  Forget the pain  Whistle at the rain  'Cause I'm friends  With the girls again  'Cause I'm friends  With the girls again  Yeah, I'm friends  With the girls again.
