It's as fun as those first few days of a two tie weave... ...when you feel like you can hear other people's thoughts. Last night at the rehearsal dinner. Hello. - Hi. You look beautiful. - You too. Where is Elise? Oh. There she is. She looks gorgeous. Hey... Trista. When am I gonna get an invite to your wedding? They say women who wait too long... ...are more likely to get stroke by lightning than to get a man. Come on. Don't worry. You'll find a man soon. There's got to be somebody out here that will marry you. So... when are you getting married? Those ovaries ain't gonna stay fresh forever. Apparently I have a better chance of being strike by lightning. For the shriveling my dusty ass ovaries, right after being rejected by the last man on earth. So don't hold your breath. Too much? Then, there's your ex-boyfriend. Who is also a groomsman. It should have been our wedding. And the moment you realize... ...that the statistical 1 in 2 black women... ...who would never get married... is you. Wait. Oh no. Oh no. You looked like a homeless person. Listen. You have to go. You have to go. Wait, wait, wait. One more thing. I need to talk to you about something. You need to... Oh. Listen. Tell me later at the wedding. But, Trista, this is important. - Oh fine. What? Trista. Come on. No. Hey. Can you give me a minute? Girl, let us in, will you? - What's going on? Oh. Hey. Thank you for... bringing that thing by. 'That thing?' That's what they're calling it now huh? Oh no. That's what they always called it. One drink, she said. - Please don't start. What did I say? Nothing good would come from it. Girl, I don't know why you still look like that. The wedding is in an hour. Is it? Oh... Look. I'll go to the church so Elise doesn't freak out. Viv. Try and do something with that. It was an accident. - It always is, girl. I'm sorry. I'm so ashamed... - Come on. Let's just get you in the shower. Oh... god. Don't look. Don't look... Hurry up, Trista. Oh my gosh. I can't believe you're stealing this stuff again. I'm not stealing. - You're so cheap. So rude of you to say. I'm helping you out. You could at least give me a little liquor. Do you think they do this to married agents? Or because I'm single. They think I'm so pathetic that I'm working on New Year's eve? My most meaningful relationship is with an electronic device. Mine too... ...but it is not a phone. Do you think that... I don't know if there's even a chance that maybe he and I... No. I mean that may... - No.... Maybe our timing is just... - No. Well, it has been years. I know how I sound. But... I'm tired of pretending that I don't care if I meet the one. Why it's okay to fight for your career. But... Ouch. Marriage is some... cosmic prize that you get... ...only after being completely peaceful that, it will never happen. So depressing. How do you beat impossible odds while pretending to not even to try? Honey. It's our hidden shame. Yeah. On top of the outer shame that no one wants to marry you. You know what? The outer shame. You could get one of your clients to write that script. Amaya could be the lead. Amaya. Oh, whatever. Hey. I'm calling to say thank you for the ticket, and the room, and the clothes. You don't know you bought that yet. But it's not the same as if you were here. And I understand why you can't be. But... Still... I'm gonna need something very expensive for this when I get back. Bye. Amaya. Is she drunk? You all were taking a long time and she was really nervous. You got her drunk? She's about to get married. Well, you all were late. Hey, here. Drink this, baby. Drink that. Tris... I'm scared. It's like... I'm handing my whole self over to someone else. And I like my whole self. Do you remember when we were in college. And, and we went to that Omega party? The one where Viviane threw up and it was so disgusting? But then William walked in and you said... One day, I'm going to marry him. - Right. That's what I said about that one twin from Jagged Edge. You remember? Today is that day. Get me a mint. I'm ready. - You're almost, almost. Okay. Why don't you take this instead? Take as many as you want. Take another one. Yeah. You take 3. Yeah. I could, I could smell... It's okay. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha. There you go. Oh. Okay. Mr and Mrs William Branford Johnson. Congratulations. And may your love continue to inspire others... ...as it has inspired me. And my fiancee. It's your turn. It's your turn. Oh. What's she doing? How exactly do you see this playing out. Did you think that you would just... - One second. Thank you. I would also like to add that. Trista is now a superstar Hollywood agent And has an amazing loft with a hot car. Thank you. Sit down. Thank you very much. And uh... ...everybody please. An applause for William and Elise. I'm sure she's a perfectly nice person. Her wean looks terrible. I think it's real. I'm sorry. You think... is that why he didn't meet me. No, no. - I know what would make you feel better. Oh no. No, no, no... Amaya. It's my baby daddy. - Please don't call him that. Fine. The venerable Dr. Shawn Broswell. Thank you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'll be right back. You'll be okay. This is for my girl, Trista, who was so embarrassed earlier. May auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind? May auld acquaintance be forgot, For the days of Auld Lang Syne... Happy New Year. - Yeah. I ran into Cory's teacher today. Since when has his grade been falling? He didn't do well on his last two tests, but I'm on it. Yeah, but his teacher asked if something is going on at home. When I get back to LA. I'm... Listen. We'll finish this later, alright? Happy New Year. Oh yeah.... Single ladies. It's that time. For the love hand get this bouquet. And maybe next New Year's eve, you'll be with somebody. If anybody need to be up here, it's you. And you all know, you're it, Come on now, ladies. Reach out. You all put your back into it. I got it. - You almost had it. I can't... do this anymore. I'm always waiting to be happy. Waiting on some promotion, Waiting to meet the right guy, blah blah blah. I just... I don't understand. I went to college, I go to church. I have a great career. and I don't get it. I mean, when is it gonna be... When is it going to be my turn? You're just having a really bad night It's New Year's Eve and you don't have anyone to kiss at midnight, and you're at a wedding without a date. And your ex, that you just slept with, is dancing with his fiancee. It's a suicide tri-factor. You're here by yourself too. Yeah, but. Once you have a kid, suicide isn't an option. Gosh. That's it. I can't do this anymore. - It's what I just said. I got to make Keith divorce his wife and marry me this year. That's not what I just said. - You know what? Me too. Me too what? I'm getting married this year too. I want Cory to have a family. A real... full-time people on TV family. Shawn and I broke up before Cory was even born, But I've never stopped loving him. I don't want Cory's knowledge of male and female relationship... ...to be this weird and tensed communication... ...between his dad and I. Because I... I want to tell him I love him. And I can't. It's just like me and Keith. I know he loves me, why he just... - It's nothing like you and Keith. I just have to try fulfill that dream with somebody else. And if it doesn't happen... ...this year. I'm going to talk to Shawn... ...about Cory and I moving to New York. - What? My family is there. My parents are there. And. I want Cory to see what people in love looked like, on a daily basis. Okay. But how would... How would that even worked? You can't make yourself be married in a year. I submit that we... ...make a vow. That we're gonna get married... - Or engaged. Within a year. - Or what? Or we call that guy. That guy. The one that has love us forever, but we're just not attracted to. Greg. - Jeffery. And we marry him. Okay. I'm in. Me too. Well then it's on. We make a vow that this time next year, Hell or high water, - 10, 9. we'll be married. - 8. Or engaged. - 7, 6, 5. Or else. - 4. 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year. 365 DAYS REMAINING So here's the plan. We do internet dating, blind date 1 minute dating. We go where the men are. Steak houses, sports bars. Guys, I'm not doing any of that. I'm marrying Keith, not some random stranger. Maybe it's a good time to meet someone new. It's a new year, maybe time for a new guy. One without a wife. Keith's wife is an alley cat who cheated on him and embarrassed him. Yeah, but that was a rumor. - Oh really? Maybe we should try a matchmaker. WOMEN. 2 CARATS. 1 YEAR. ... ...THE CLOCK IS TICKING... XOXO, TRISTA... ...THE VOW Oh my god. Would you watch where you're going? How am I suppose to go to our staff meeting like this? I think you look good like that. Hey, I was kidding. Come on. It's a compliment. Don't act like you don't have a shirt like that in your office right now. So if the single is 'When I Fall in Love', the B side is 'Working Day and Night.' Aiming for a promotion at an agency like this... ...means a 16 hour a day commitment. But it's worth it. Rooms like this is where we decide... ...what you will be watching 2 years from now. So 'Seven Days', the spec Jordana Jones is suppose to attach to... ...just made 'The Black List'. I'm going to package it... Thank you, Trista. I think everybody wants to deal with the Terrance Robb thing. Before I start, I want to make this clear. Terrance Robb is the guy right now. He thinks us passing on 'A Dirty Job', cost him an Oscar. Now, how do we convince him that this is still the best place for him, when he's right? 'A Dirty Job' was too girdy for him. Terrance Robb is America's action hero next door. We don't want to see him having sex in back alley ways. We want to see him saving puppies from alien invasions. And that helps the current problem, how? With such a high volume of clients and scripts. No good. - But I wasn't finished. The path you're going down, smaller is better... ...is not for the agency. Hey guy, listen. Terrance Robb, like every other actor on earth, really wants to be a musician. Why are we not using this to our advantage? There's always one other black guy, Smirk, Ivy leaguer. I rather drop dead than date his sister. And his off golfing every weekend, while you're buried in scripts. And for some reason, it works for him. I like it. Who's that? - Amaya. I gave her keys in case her boyfriend puts her out. Why would you even say something like that? 'Cos he's got a wife, and she got to come home. Why would he do that? - You don't know. Because he got a wife. Hoo, hoo, hoo... What? Ha, ha, ha... Yeah. Oh no... I just want you to see what I've stooped to. My boyfriend is one of the most powerful man in the music business. What's left of the music business. And I have to sell fish on the side of a road, in a suit they can't even reuse... ...caused it's so musty from all the other commercials they've done. Oh, baby. - Can you smell me? Yes. Here's dinner, by the way. Aw, well. - Thank you. If it helps, I had one of those days too. Oh really? You had to sit in the hot sun and eat... ...greasy sandwiches for 10 takes, while trying not to puke? No, not exactly like that. But... God, thank you. - You're welcome. You know if Keith and I were official. And he wasn't married. And everyone knew we were together, I wouldn't have to take parts as a fish. Thank you. To be able to practise my craft. If you spend half the time on your craft than you do on Keith, You might have an Oscar by now. Or Golden Globe, or Tony. A couple of Emmys. BET Awards. Ha, ha, ha... NAACP. No, I'm sorry. I hate you all. - No, here. Try put this on. I was very comfortable just like this. Of course. You look nice, baby. - Thank you. What were you all doing anyway? Online dating profiles. Trista is making me do it. Yes, I am. So she doesn't flake. You sure you don't want us to do one for you? I already have a boyfriend. I... I see that. I'm sick of you diminishing my relationship, Trista. What Keith and I have is real. I know it's not conventional. - Or right. But I caught a break with Keith. And I'm gonna make it worked, okay. You know I wouldn't have to dress up like a fish. if someone would represent me. I knew this was going to coming up. Just putting the agency on my resume would be life changing. Tris. It probably wouldn't, Amaya. I mean you would get no attention at... ...an agency that big when you're so... Small. Ah-huh. You heard it. You heard it. No. That is not what I meant. They just want us to sign clients with the ability to make money... ...as soon as they walked in the door. And right now... - Just forget it. It just.... I don't want you to think that I'm not listening to you, Amaya. Okay. What turns you on? A passport and a library card. - Sexy. A big... - Career. Oh... you're being nasty. Okay. Good looking. - Yeah. Great family.. Maybe he does something in finance. Say you were doing good. You were until you started describing Damon. You're right. Okay, supportive. - Yes. That's not Damon. - No. And knows when I'm up at 3 am reading scripts. The answer to any questions involving chocolate or caffeine is... Yes. That's good. I like it. - Yeah, me too. You know, Viv? You could be a lot more supportive too. Oh, oh. Oh. So now you're coming for me? Yes. Because your blog is like the black TMZ... ...and you haven't written one word about Keith's wife cheating on him. That's because there is no proof. - What if I got proof? Woo. That's a mighty big 'if'. If I got proof, would you print it? I'm sure I could find an angle. Oh my goodness. If there's proof. - Okay. And just like that. Dr. Frankenstein released the monster. Are we going to submit these things or what? Count of 3. 3... ...SPY EYEWEAR No matter where you go in the world, Once you leave the United States, the coffee tastes better. That is so true. One of the places I always wanted to go is Greece. I wonder what's going on over there. I don't know, or Italy. I'm open. I always love traveling and seeing the world. You must have go everywhere, huh? Excuse me, sir. Are you the driver of that vehicle? Oh. Is it the meter? I have change. Sir, are you aware that vehicle was reported stolen earlier today? Stand up, sir. I'm placing you under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you by the court. Do you understand your rights since I had read them? Normally, I only date really pretty chicks. Like girls on BET, models. - Those aren't models. Even though you're not hot like that, It's real cool to conversate with someone so smart. It's 'converse', actually. See? That's exactly what I'm talking about. Too bad I'm so ugly, right? You're not that bad. You ever thought abut getting your breast done? I used to strip, like yeah. They used to call me the 'Brown Hornet'. I had a stinger and everything. It was crazy. Yeah. Then I changed my name to 'Black Thor'. Got to take my special powers to pick up this hammer. I got a latex allergy, so I never use condoms. But everybody I slept with, they looked cool. You know what I'm saying. They... Does it look that I got something? I also run a small key ministry. It's about 13 kids. 12 of them are mine. I just found out. You know I'm not all the way paid up on my child support so... We're kind of being like a mobile ministry. We're jumping around a little bit, because they will find you. Let me tell you. Pal-Page Kitty is shopping in Beverly Hills Viviane says she wants proof, I'll get her proof. And Trista... Whatever. Suite 1200 FERTILITY SPECIALIS Oh no... The parties aren't as interesting when you have to go. But, when I don't I don't feel like I'm doing my job. And when I do go, I feel guilty you know for leaving my son. The true is I don't even know if I want to do this anymore. I. I actually want to write a book. You know? You look a lot smaller in your online photo. Oh, Hey. Hey. How was your work day? Actually, it was a date. It was. It was great. So much fun. Oh. How come you're home so early? I figured you would want to go home early for a change. Excuse me for being considered. Try to do you a favor, I mean. Remember we have a meeting with Cory's councilor next week. Yeah, I'll be there. Bye. One good thing I have at that date. Why do I have to go on these damn dates? What I really want is right here at home. I could really just try it with Shawn. Why does Trista get to say how the damn Vow works anyway? Why does Trista have to know? Account canceled. So. It's pretty adventurous, having a first date on Valentine's Day, huh? You know, Harry (Hairy)... - Larry. Larry. I figure, why play games? If I wasn't single, I wouldn't be online dating. Well, I'm glad that you feel that way. I'm sorry, there's a hair in my drink. - So sorry. Can you just bring me another one, please? Thank you. Try one of my shrimp. - Oh no. No, no, no... - Oh. Come on. Try one of my shrimp. Come on. - No, no. I'm good, Harry. Try one of my shrimp. - No. Are you okay? - Yes. No. Sorry, I just need some... I need some hair. Some air. Excuse me. Jeffery? What are you doing here? It's time, Trista. - Time for what? No. No, you're the guy Amaya has to be with if the vow doesn't work. It's all one and the same, isn't it? 1 Ice Cream Sandwich and 1 wedding ring. But I wanted a cherry bomb. Yeah, but. I think it's time for you to settle... settle... settle... No. No. No.... ...319 DAYS REMAINING I think I have post-traumatic dating syndrome. Me too. My date even made me more committed to the vow. Your date? You only had one date, Viviane? I've been busy. Do you remember when we were in college and we did the master cleanse. And Amaya and I were fainting and had chastised by day 10, and you didn't tell us you started eating again on day 3? I had a deadline. I needed my strength. And your point is what? My point is. You're not doing the Vow, are you? There is nothing I want more than to be married in a year. How's Amaya's devious little plan going? She was at my house last night, if that tells you anything. It tells me it was Valentine's Day and he's married. Preaching to the choir. You know what? I'm emailing her right now. How is the vow working? I am flailing... Viviane is flaking Okay, Ten and a half months to get a husband. Seriously, how are we gonna to do this? To: Nate Adamson Subject: how is the vow working? Send. Mr. Nilson is ready for you. Hey Viv, I got to go. I heard. Good luck. - Thank you baby. I'll call you after. The problem with Terrance Robb is that he's represented by you. Not you. You because... you have so many big clients. Now I would like to be on Terrance's team specifically representing him for indes... ...so that we would never missed that Oscar winning role again. Warren and I discussed a similar strategy. And? - And we were thinking Nate. Right. Well. Thank you for listening. No, no. Nate didn't walk in here with this idea. He can be a liaison on the musical thing. That was his. But half the inde producers in this town are women. Does Nate has a vagina? - No. Months before the 'A Dirty Job' was cast, I read it and I emailed the script to everyone. And I said, this would be perfect for Terrance Robb. It turns out I was right. Let me know when you made your decision. Pretty sure you meant to send this to somebody else. How's the year going so far? This is not what you think it is. So you and your friends didn't make a vow to be married within a year? I just wanted to tell you... ...you should probably be a little more careful with your emails. Well, thank you for that unsolicited advice, Nate. But I'm trying to get some work done. Perhaps you should try it. Please return my property. Alright, well. I'll see you tonight. Get out. So this one is from The Ivy, when she was having lunch with Darryl Crane, the footballer player. What NFL player do you know goes to The Ivy allegedly by himself? What? That's ridiculous. Do not indulge her. Look. What is he doing here? Well, he is a plastic surgeon. He's probably done half the faces in here. That's true. You okay? Yeah, its... I drank a little too much. I'm being summoned. Hi, Dr. Broswell. - Hey, Noelle. All healed up. Looks good, right? It does. Even if I do say so myself. This is my sister I told you about, Karen. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. Terrance.. - Yes I want to introduce you to the newest member of your team, Trista Miller. James, you hired supermodels to get me to stay? Trista is one of our sharpest agent. - I see. Who looks like a supermodel. She's going to be representing you in independent features. So. How should we celebrate? A little dancing. No, no. No one actually dances at these things. How are you going to pave for Oscar, win a path for me by doing everyone else does? Dance with him. You heard the man. Dance with Me. - Okay. Yes? - Hello, beautiful. And don't worry, I won't always talk to you like that. When you start making me some money, you'll be upgraded to gorgeous. I love how I am two steps away from my desk. And they put you through to my cell already. Let me get this straight. You've never worked with a major movie star before. How about I take you out to dinner. To show you how the whole thing is working? How about we do lunch instead? Because I'm a major movie star, and I think that I just made a request for my new agent. Are you going to keep throwing this major movie star thing around? That's just kind of what major movie stars do. But this is work, right? - Of course it is. Look, we can meet tomorrow for dinner. and you can tell me about how much you accomplished on day 1. Okay you go ahead you get back to work... ...and I'll give you a call tomorrow. Yes, boss. Bye. Is Cory ready? - Oh he's almost finished. Well, that smells good. You expecting somebody? Well, I thought it would be nice if we have a family dinner. Oh, yeah. We're going to the (LA)Kings' game. Since when do you like hockey? - Hey, little man. You know he's excited about the game though. So, Maybe we'll do it another time? Yeah, sure. - Alright, come on. He has a history project coming up next weekend. His counselor thinks we should work together... ...on it with him... together. Yeah, just call me tomorrow and we'll work out the schedules. Okay. - Alright. come on, man. Have fun. - We have great seats. You know what. - Then, we can both join the rally.. Check them right in the glass. Right there. You're good. You gave me just the address on purpose... ...because you knew I 'wouldn't' have dressed like this. Barbecue and fried chicken. I assumed that you would be business casual. You said it was work. Are you dressed for a date? Okay, you're funny, but, since you brought up work. I brought you these. I've put notes on top. Which one I think are 'No' and which one I think are 'Yes' This... This is the best one out there. Now, they were going in a different direction, but... I convinced them to consider you. Your brain works like one of those computer screens in Minority Report. This sweeping things around and reorganizing them. Which is kinda cute. - Kinda? A little hot. I'm into professional-agent client relationship type of way. Oh yeah, now. I'm a professional like... Sexually platonic. Or is it platonic sexual? What is 'platonic'? Let's just like, swoop that word out. You're funny. Okay. - You looked amazing. Thank you... What? - Happy to see you too. If you're here to taunt me again about the vow. Honestly, I don't need it. No. That's not what it is. I know it's not my place, and it's really none of my business. But, I think it's a good idea... ...to keep a bit of professional distance between you and the clients. And you think you're so much sharper than me... ...that you needed to come in here and state the obvious? No, not sharper. Just... ...more removed. I've seen Terrance operate before. - Well, thank you. But, I'm good. Trista, why are you an agent? Because... - Because, why? I grew up... in Compton, just outside Hollywood, but still outside Hollywood. One year, my dad took me to the Oscar's, just the bleaches. And you could see the fans and actresses and the paparazzi. And suddenly being a latchkey kid from Compton thought it just seemed so... ...far away. You know. The movies took the regular world and... ...turned it into something better. And... I knew then, that I wanted to be a part of it. I want you to think about that... ...every single time you speak to Terrance Robb. 'Cos if you get too close, all of that... is in jeopardy. Compton, huh? How do your parents feel about their little girl becoming a hot shot agent? They're both gone now. You know my friends are my family. But they are very proud. Maybe we should wait, just... Hey, look. I was thinking the same thing. I'm sitting here trying to be professional, To get some work done and you're trying to seduce me. No, honestly. It's just... I don't think right You don't have to explain. If you want to wait, we'll wait. I mean I can wait for you. Standing on my head. Do it. Right now? - Yeah. Don't tempt me, because I'm gonna do it. Don't let this big house and this nice suit fool you. I'll turn up. Don't make me do it. I ain't going to do it. - Stand up. Terrance is very excited about this. We are too. We would never have thought... ...to go that way with the role. But he's definitely our Nick. And sure adding his huge box office doesn't hurt. We find a way to be okay with that. I know you will. Call me for lunch. Nice work, Trista. - Thank you, James. Now call your client. Tell him you just got him the lead in the hottest script in town. I got an idea. Terrance? What are you doing here? I'm... sorry. I'm sorry. Wait. Wait. I'm.. I'm... I just. I... ...280 DAYS REMAINING Can I run you a bath? Since when do I take bath, Viviane? Only a woman with no self worth... ...would think of not having at least one relaxing bath a week. Well, I never take baths. So. - There you go. So, what is this Terrance Robb business? I just got him a movie. The movie. And if he doesn't win an Oscar, he would at least get nominated. And. I'm so excited. You know I just... I wanted to tell him and I called him and I called him. He doesn't answer. So I'm like, I'll go over and maybe we can... ...celebrate or... I walked in and it looks like some kind of... ...bad out take for Purple Rain. I mean he's got strippers, and they're popping pills, And this masseuse man just... ...spraying body oil over everybody and rubbing Terrance. Wow. So. What's gonna happen with your job? Well, I... I mean I just got him that movie. So... I should be safe. You know. Hopefully. Yeah. I don't think the chemistry between you and Terrance is really working. I just got him the best job... Yeah, but the way the client feels... ...is as important as the work we got for them. If they are not happy... - What is this really about? Warren and I feel that, an actor of Terrance Robb's stature, should have the most seasoned agent. You know I can't afford a demotion like that. And legally I... - As a junior agent. Even if there were a law suit You'll never get another job in this town. So I'm fired? We at the agency support you. and wishes you all the best in your future endeavors. Where's the tape? - Yeah. Last piece of the board going on. Alright. - Looking good, right? Yeah. You want to show him the best part? The is the best part. That.... My job is the best part. - No, it is not. Look at this. Checked that out. Oh. It is a new take on history. Oh, I love it. I love... ...it... too... Good job, man. Well look, I got to go. Oh hey. If you're not doing anything on Saturday, Maybe we can take Cory out to LACMA. I think the councilor is right that we should work with him as a team. Yeah, I think I can... I can get into that... I mean. I like that. See you then. Whatchu got? Better keep practicing that. because I coming back for you. I'll be back. Go to bed. 4TH OF JULY KEITH'S MANSION What are you doing? Oh. I'm press. I'm covering the party. My name is Viviane Rhimes. No, you're not. I read her column everyday. And this is a private party. Let's go. But um. Wait. Keith. Keith. Keith. Oh. Can I at least use the bathroom? Got you. You're the Wednesday afternoon, right? I mean there's so many of you it's hard to keep track. And then there's the Thursday night Lithuanian basketball player, who I love. She's my favorite. Honey, there is nothing that happens in Keith's life that I don't know about. Is your credit card still working? I told him to raise your limit. Let me tell you how it is. He does his thing and I do my thing. And I... Well, I get to keep the black card and the... ...court side Lakers' seats. And he gets to stay the nice, safe happy family man... ...for a very nervous corporate board. Until he gets sloppy, and baby did he get sloppy. So, why don't you climb into your broke down 98 Accord, or whatever the hell it is you drive. And remind yourself. He will never leave her. This will never be my house. This will never be my wedding ring. And you'll never have my life. Bye, silly goose. That's what you think. How many days have you been like this? - A week. You have got to start looking for another job. I have... 'We regret to inform you...' - Please, don't. I couldn't hear it anymore. I'm official persona non grata. You think they did a number on you. Probably, but... Even if they didn't, no one is hiring, Viv. What is that? Pancake mix. Come on. Come on. Oh, honey. I don't want to answer it. Hello. Trista Miller's phone. Hi, Nate. Let me see if she's available? - No. I'm so sorry, she is busy. Could I have her return your call? Thank you. Now, now, now... For my news. We're going to Cleveland. Yeah... It's the Hall of Fame induction. I'm covering it for my job. I can't effort it, Viv. I'm unemployed. - I'm paying. My job is paying. I... You know, I don't pay. And Amaya is coming too, because Keith is gonna... ...get us a room or something. God. - Some kind of deal he... I will take that as a 'yes.' Plus, there's a big surprise when you get there. 180 DAYS REMAINING CLEVELAND, OH I don't care what happened or who did it, We're going to have some fun this weekend. Hey. Hi, baby. Shawn would love this. What I love, is Viviane's column today. Did you all see it? A deal is a deal, baby. - Thank you. Shawn and I made a deal with Cory. That if he gets straight 'A's, we're gonna take him to Disneyland. What's with the mentionitis. - Yeah. I'm not mentionitis. Yeah, you do. That's 2 Shawns in the last minute. I got to make a phone call. Who are you calling? - Uh-huh. Bye, Shawn. We love you, Shawn. So... Any ideas on The Vow? I'm pretty close on mine. - What's the vow? Some stupid... - The best idea we ever had. We're all getting married in a year, and the year started at your wedding. Why? - So we can be happy. Then take a vow and be happy. One and the same. - No, it's not. I am married. - And you're happy. No, I'm not. Not all the time anyway. I have to make concession for another person... ...whose taking up more space than I'm used to giving. I quit my job at the hospital. Why did you quit your job? We were trying to get pregnant and... I miscarried. Oh... Elise. Baby, why didn't you tell us? - Yeah. I was embarrassed. Baby, that is not your fault. I was embarrassed it was so relieved. Well, when Keith and I get married, I'm going to be happy. Well I hope no one tries to break it up. You could at least be happy for me. I was happy for you when you got on team Robb. For all the good that did you. Well I didn't hurt anyone to get that. You are destroying a marriage. You can't destroy something that's not already broken. Really? The law of gravity disagrees. You know, Trista? If things don't work out between you and the men you date, Maybe the problem is you. And you need to look in the mirror... ...instead of throwing all the shade in my way. And P.S. I know that's why you really don't want to represent me. If I had a man and a career, what would you have to laud over? No, the truth is. The reason I don't represent you. Is because being on a cover of a 'Dark and Lovely' box, a decade and a half ago, doesn't make you an actress. I've done a lot more since then, Trista. - Oh, you heard that thing And you know it. You're right. I didn't tell the biggest agency in the world. That they just have to take the girl who sells Compton's own catfish for J & J. Aren't you from Compton, Trista? I don't have a problem being from Compton. No? You act like you do have a problem... Hey, It's Shawn. I can't get to the phone right now. But if you leave me a message, I'll call you right back. Hello? I'm... I'm so sorry, I... I think I have the wrong number. Are you looking for Shawn? Yes Okay, this is his girlfriend, But he just ran back inside with his son. Stop it. - You stop. Stop it. Give me my hat. Would you stop it? - No, it is her. You're the one whiner. What? And you called me a nerd. She called me lonely I didn't say you were lonely I just said you couldn't keep a man. You can only keep somebody else's man. And that doesn't count. But I have a man. Here, don't uh-uh... You're not going to walk away from me. You know why you can't throw your walled degree or career in my face. I'm not doing this with you, Amaya. - Trista. Of cause you don't want to. Of course you don't Oh my gosh. Viviane. Call 911. - Oh my god. I'm gonna need some oxygen. Okay. - Oh my god. Oh my god, Viv? Alright, stay with me, Viv. Stay with me... Come on. Stay with me. You're going to be okay, baby. Stay with me. EMERGENCY ENTRANCE Shawn. Where is she? - Thank God you got a flight out so fast. Listen. Her doctor said she had a mild heart attack, but she's going to be okay. Your friend is fine. She's resting now. We'll release her tomorrow. Thank you. - Thank you. Okay, listen. You guys can go. I will stay and I'll call if anything changes. No, no, no. We don't mind... It's okay. It's okay. I'll... I'll take care of her. Okay. I'll call you. I promise. - Thank you. Okay. Hey. What is that? Gift shop. And I know you need one, 'cos latchkey kids never have key chains. Nate. - What's wrong? Amaya and I were you fighting, and then Viviane was on the floor. And... What are you doing here? Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame. Making them our music division number 1. And I looked up and what do I see? But you fighting in the lobby. And... what happened to your friend? Is she gonna be okay? - Yeah, now she's fine. Wait, aren't you missing the ceremony? Yeah, but it couldn't possibly be as exciting as the rumble in the lobby. I ruined everything. Amaya, my job, the Vow. Well. I don't know what to tell you about all that. But I was calling the other day because... You called? - Yeah. Oh, right. I was ignoring you. Anyway, I had an idea. I have a few clients that are always complaining to me about... ...the fact that their management is so big, that they can't properly service them. And I recalled that being your complaint over at the agency as well. So. I figured why not. Go in the business as a manager. Be your own boss. Because I can't afford it. I need a job now. Come on. Don't worry about that. I can float you the money. Like I said. These people are already working. So, you'll be able to pay me back. Like that. Why would you do that? I like a girl with a little bite and a bark. Get some rest, Sugar Ray. You had a big day. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Nate. - Yeah. Can you stay? On the couch? Just until I fall asleep? I have nightmares. Yeah, of course. Thanks for not mentioning that I looked like a homeless person. I think you look beautiful. But that's just me. I will be right here. Good night. - Good night. 96 DAYS REMAINING So uh. My mom says Cory is still asleep. So. I'll just bring him back when he wakes up. Thank you. For everything. Oh, come on now. You knew there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. I never stopped loving you. And there's all this friction between us because I can't get over it. And I don't want to do this anymore. I think that it would be good for Cory and I to move to New York. Wait, wait, wait. Viviane... You're a good dad. And I don't want to take him away from you, but... Cory is confused. I just think it would be best... ...for all of us. Viviane. Viviane... The thing is. I really want to be an actress. And, at my age, trying for something with Keith... ...was easier than going for what I really wanted, than hearing, 'You're too old.' I guessed, the vow game give me something real to try for. So If what I wanted didn't happen, then something else might. I didn't know it would make me nuts. We were like Gollum in Lord of the Rings. What is that? - Lord of the Rings? Is that the movie with the kids in a magic school? There is this ring. The Precious. And everybody wants it, because they think it gives you all these powers. But there are these monsters you have to deal with. Like the creepy guys we dated. And the friends turned on each other, and then the ring makes everyone crazy. That movie sounds great. I thought it was about wizards. My point is that I'm sorry, Amaya. The Precious made me do it. I'm sorry too. Now. What is all this? Oh. I'm starting a new business. So, I'm expanding my home office. What is the business? - I'm going into talent management. Oh. That's great. I want you to be my first client. Me? You have the goods, Amaya. You always have. You just need to hone your technique. And stop waiting for someone else to get you there. But in the mean time, to make it official. Okay. Amaya Adams. - Yes. Do you wanna be my very first client? I do. Then I now pronounce us. Manager and client. - Yeah. The vow brought everything to who I am. I'm back in acting class. Kitty and Keith split up. You finally started your book and that one started her own business. You looked so familiar to me. You come here before? - No, no. But I'm sure I've seen you somewhere. The Vow did made me make a big decision. Cory and I... - Wait. Terrance Robb. You're the one who passed out... That's me. And you're the one who was sprinkling baby oil. I'm Mikiko. - Mikiko. Yes, Mikiko. - This is Mikiko. Girl, I wouldn't have just left you there, but he threw us all out. No. He got me fired. Bastard. - I know. I like that. Can you...? You want this? You want this? - Yes. Yes. Let's do this. Come come. Oh my god. Viv, I'm sorry. What were you saying? Oh nothing, I'm... I'll tell you later. Okay. Thank you. TM Management Trista Miller - Owner Yeah. Get me Trista Miller on the phone, please. Yes, this is fantastic. Dude is probably take that... Oh, no, no, no... - Thank you. Please... it is the least I can do after everything you done. Well, listen. Let me do one more thing for you. I think that will worth your while. - Okay. The movie you got Terrance.... It's going. And. For the love interest is... still wide open. They're looking for an urban unknown Marilyn Monroe type. Kinds of sounds like... - Amaya. How do you know? They haven't released anything. Oh, because I'm a man. You really want to leave right now, don't you? I don't. But, yes. Go ahead. Go tell her. And if I hear anything more on my end, I'll let you know. I got to go. - Alright. Okay. I'll see you soon. Breathe. I was racing over here. And in the car, I'm thinking. How am I going to get her this audition. And won't Terrance try to block it... ...once he realizes that she's my client and all. You know how Amaya always says: 'Use what you have to get what you want' Well, what I have right now is you Okay. What... What do you need? Okay. I need a blind item. Okay. - And then... Okay. So... um... Wait. What is this? I talked to Shawn, and we think that it is... ...more stable for Cory... ...if his mom isn't all, you know... We'll work it out. Yeah. Tell me about this blind item. Yeah. So. I just need you to say. 'Hi, Terrance', when I cue you. This is Terrance. Just leave a message. So, I'm sitting with Viviane Rhimes, the voice of Hollywood. Say, 'Hi, Terrance.' - Hi, Terrance. And she was asking me questions about why we no longer worked together. Now, she's my friend, so, obviously, she knows. I know. These questions are on the record. Now. She can tell the story 1 of 2 ways. 1. What really happened, which kills your whole America's nice black friend thing, or 2... Kill the story altogether. That all depends on whether or not you call me back in the next hour. And just to help you with your decision. Your friend Mikiko, He is now also a friend of mine. Oh, and apparently a very big fan of smart phone photography. Woo.... ...84 DAYS REMAINING So. I couldn't get him to guarantee you the part. Only the studio can do that. But he's making them read you. So he would look crazy saying anything but great things after. I just have to kick ass. You just have to kick ass. Okay. Amaya. You can do this. Oh no, it's okay. I'm off book. The scene has been rewritten. You will need to read. Okay. Thanks. 'I know I made some mistakes. And while you were out saving the world....' I'm sorry, I was really prepared for the other scene. Do you mind if I try again. Thanks. 'I know I made some mistakes And while you were out saving the world....' Do you mind if I just take a minute? Make it brief. Thank you. Wait a second. - We come here all the time... Wait, wait, wait... Wait. It's the casting director. Answer it, fool. Hello. Yes. Uh-huh. Yes, well, no. I understand. Okay. No, no, it's fine. Thank you for calling. Bye bye. I'm sorry, Trista. I really did tried my best. No, it's okay. The important thing is. Is they got to see you. Which... They will be doing for the next 3 months. You got the part. You got it. Oh. Thank you so much. Oh my god. - Waiter. We need a bottle. Trista, listen to me. I wanted to tell you, but you kept rushing me out. Maybe you should have tried before we slept together. I know. But I saw you, and all these old feelings came back. I was wrong. And I told her I was wrong. And now it's over. Then why did it take you... ...10 months to come back here and say all that? Because I wanted to be clear about how I felt. So I wouldn't hurt you. Again. Damon, I wanted to be married. And this time I'm not gonna assumed that you want the same thing. So. Without a ring, I really can't hear you. Well, that's why I came here for. I finally think I'm ready. My office transferred me here, and it seemed like a sign to do what I should have done years ago. Trista Miller. Will you marry me? Yes. 79 DAYS REMAINING How did it go? Everyone said I had the best costume, so I get extra candy. Too bad you can't eat all that. Think about it this way. You'll be the most popular boy in school when you start giving it away. Oh, thank you. - I'm going to miss you. Well, Cory's just a flight away. And luckily, you have a girlfriend. - Yeah, I broke up with her. All that stuff you said... I didn't know you felt that way. So I need to think. And... ...can't do that with someone else around. So... She's gone now. So much was going on when you got pregnant. I was in Med school. And having a kid was... - Yes, I... Back then, I wouldn't think about... ...us having a kid. Sometimes I just wonder what would happened if... We were to met now. We wouldn't have our college intuition time bomb downstairs. Yeah. Come on. Let me make you some tea. Now remember. I just had a heart attack. This will be good for your heart. Cory. What about Cory? - Cory, that boy ought to be sleeping. Hey. - Hey. I heard your girl got the part. Congratulation, superstar. Yeah, thank you. So, You're going to treat me to dinner somewhere else this time? Well, I... I can't. So. I got engaged. It just happened. We're trying to do it by the end of the year. The engagement dinner is next week, I... I... I was going to send you an invitation. Yeah, yeah. I know. I'll... I'll definitely keep an eye out for that. 61 DAYS REMAINING Did I miss anything good? Girl. Mr marvelous is giving a toast. May I have your attention, please? Thank all of you for coming out. But if you are still in Los Angeles on Thanksgiving, You had no plans anyway, so we did you all a favor. Why is she doing this again? The Vow. - The Vow. You all got to stop her. - Trista. Baby, You put up with so much for me. And I know, every woman your age had more choices you wouldn't have. Really? So you're here tonight. So I guess I'm doing so far.. so good. I wrote you a song about it. Here's how it go. Is he singing a song? Is he really? I never thought. I could fall for you. I didn't think. You were my type. But it looks like I could be wrong Baby, Excuse me, ma'am, I have an urgent call for you. The shadows of doubt. They still linger. But they started to fade. As each day. As each day goes by. I know that I... ...have been wrong before. But I think this time I'm gonna stay around for more... So far... So good... I didn't think we could get along. But you're still here... So far... So good... Trista. Oh god. Nate, please give me a second. Hey. Please tell me you're not doing this. Because of that stupid vow thing. I'm not. - Then why? What is it? You can barely breathe with this guy around. I have waited for this my whole life. And I know that there was... I was starting to feel something too. But... I... I can't wait anymore. So I'm saying, yes. Because this might be my last chance at happiness. But you don't look happy. - Would you just... ...leave me alone? Let me just say this first. Trista, happiness is not something that happens down the road. Happiness is now. Or not at all. And if your life is spend... ...waiting for something else to happen to get you there. You're not living. And that's not happiness. That's a boss that's never satisfied, that will always have some other stupid project for you to do... ...before it grants you you wish. And that is not happiness. This... This is happiness. Finally. What took you so long? I was with Kitty. - You were with who? We're not going to have a divorce, Because if we did, we are setting ourselves up for a lot of public scrutiny And we're not trying to do that right now. Well. There's no time like the present. I was thinking about this. How about, me and you. Let's go back to the way it used to be, babe? Oh, you mean like. Sneaking around and pretending it's okay. When you don't even speak to me in public? Ain't never happened. - It did happened. I was wrong for being with you in the first place. You were never wrong. I was. - What we do ain't wrong. And this is a chance for me to get my karma right. What does karma got to do with this? How about you, go back to the way you used to be. With someone else. Because I'm done. Amaya. - I'm done. Amaya. - Kick rocks. That is me, babe. And this is me. Goodbye. What's going on? Where is Cory? - He's at my mother's. This is beautiful. Well um. Looker closer. How did you do this? I paid off the restaurant. And I spent the last week getting everything ready. Because... I wanted everything to be perfect. For when I did this. Viviane Rhimes. My greatest joy and... ...biggest pain in the butt. Would you continue to be both of those things... ...for the rest of my life? You're asking me to marry you? That's what the ring is for, yes. Yes. Because you love me? Or because you don't want me to take Cory away? Is both wrong? No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. - Yes, you are. I can't believe it. Baby, that meal was wonderful. Amazing. - Weren't it? Thanks, Viv. Thank you guys. - But uh. The game is on. So I got to go. Hey, I'm gonna roll with you. Ladies, please. Don't let this one eat any more. I want her to lose weight before the wedding. Over here. No. - No, no. Wait, what wait. - No. What is going on? Girl. Look, we need to talk. We think the Vow was tricking you into making a big mistake. Yes. Says the newly engaged Viviane Rhimes? I know, but... I'm doing the Vow. That's it. But, Trista... - That's it. This is a mistake. - Know what? You do it. 0 DAYS REMAINING I can't do this. You don't deserve this. What? - But I think we're making a mistake. I know I should have said something earlier, but... I didn't know until just now. Tris. This is just cold feet. When I was little, I was obsessed with sunsets. I would sit in my window... ...and wait for the exact moment that it became twilight. And then, I'll write it in this little notebook. Meanwhile, the other kids were in the street playing in the sun. By the end of the day, I could check off. Watch the sunset, but I missed living in the sun. Damon, I don't want to do that with love. You realized, at your age, This is your last chance, right? That is entirely likely. And you think this is going to make you happy? It is improving my odds by the second. Hallelujah. - Bye bye. Yes. It's still was a beautiful wedding. What's going on? How about... How about us using it? What? - What? I mean, look at all these flowers and food. You know. It's a lot of good money going to waste and... and... What's she doing? I mean, we know everybody here. You... are the cheapest person ever. A used wedding, Viv? Think of this as something borrowed. - Something used. Only you, Viviane. At the altar, only you. Yes. Of course. Nothing would make me happier. Yes. Wait, wait. Nobody move. This is so crazy. What... what? Baby, what are you doing? Honey, do you have any surprise wedding tricks up your sleeve? No, I was going to let you plan all that. Oh, good. We can keep our money in the college fund. What, you want to... You want to get married, right now? Do you know how much a wedding like this cost? Our friends are here, Cory, your mom. Let's do it. - Okay. This is crazy. Hi. This isn't exactly the right order. Well, if we want to do things in the right order, we wouldn't have a kid first. Do you... Shawn Broswell. Take this woman... Viviane Rhimes. Do you promise to comfort her, honor her. Forsaking all others, remain faithful until death do you part? Absolutely. And, do you? Yes, I do. Yes. Yes. - But wait. Listen. We have to do this all over again... ...at the courthouse, to make it legal. But... You know... - Just go ahead. Then by the power vested in me, I pronounce that you are man and wife. Mom and Dad got married, man. I'm sorry about your friend, but you know uh... No, it's okay. Congratulation. - Thank you. Thank you, appreciate it. Oh, excuse me fellas. Did you go and changed again? Of course I did. It's our wedding night. You look beautiful, baby. - Thank you. It's our wedding night. - It is our wedding night. It's our wedding night. Hey... Hey. - Hey, guys. William, Elise. Meet Jeffery. Nice to meet you. You guys have man talk. We're gonna go get a drink - Yeah. Okay. But don't take too long now. Woo.... Thank you. - Thanks. Now. Tell me about you and Jeffery. Oh, well. He's the guy I had to call if I didn't do the Vow. But the only reason why I didn't like him... ...is because he is a teacher. So... He's a lowpro. So, what changed? Well. Now I have money. So it doesn't matter. That's right. You know. I wasn't gonna come. 'Cos you forgot this. I didn't get married. - There is still time. Would it be completely tacky of me to ask you to dance at your wedding? Let's break with convention. Come on. No matter what happens. By this time next year, I'll be married. Can you give me a second? Of course. - I'll be right back. Yeah, I'll be here. Do you Trista Miller, realized that life is short. And if you spend all your time waiting on a job or the one. That you waste a perfectly good chance to be happy. I do. Then, by the power vested in you. I make a new vow. That. Single or married. Working or not. That you would never wait for anything outside yourself to change... ...before you choose to be happy. You may now kiss, the new you. 10, 8, 7, 6. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year. Congratulations. I know it's was gonna happen. Happy New Year, baby. Let's get a picture. No, no, no. - Why not? Just the girls. - Alright, alright. Everybody say Happy New Year. 1, 2, 3. Happy New Year. color='#ffff00'- Aorion -
