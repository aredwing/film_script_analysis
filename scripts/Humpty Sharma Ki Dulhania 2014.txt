What are you doing, man?! Stop wasting time... You're done for in this exam, buddy. Chill, Shonty... I know everything. What is this, Humpty? Sir! I've left everything to the mercy of God! Sir, my father says, what you don't know, leave to God! And I really don't know History... ...so I've left it to God. You're going to fail, man... Listen to me. Copy a few answers. Sir, my father says "no cheating." I can't break his trust. Don't worry, sir! God will handle everything! Okay, sir? Jai Mata Di! "Fool... fool... fool... fool... fool..." "Emotional Fool" "Fool... fool... fool... fool..." "Emotional Fool" "Emotional..." "You'll get in trouble if you listen to this fraud of a heart" "Oh, baby, my heart's a liar" "Reciting Ghalib's poetry, pretending he's a poet" "Can't think of enough curses to give him" "Messes me up While it's acting cool" "My heart is an emotional fool" "My heart is an emotional fool" "My heart is an emotional fool" "My heart is an emotional fool" "Fool... fool... fool... fool... fool..." "Emotional Fool" "Fool... fool... fool... fool..."

Chest... 44. 44! Look, Mum. Chest is still 44 inches. Let your chest swell up with pride, my son! Like Sylvester Stallone! Bansi! - Yes? You've taken Kavya's measurements for her gown, right? No Ma'am. Kavya and her sister have gone to the cyber caf. How do you know? Sir, they rushed off in front of me! I told her I had to take her measurements but... ...Kavya said she won't wear a local gown. Really? - Hmm. What a drama queen she is. How do you like it?! Screw you! You've got a designer gown! Of course! And it cost 2 and a half lakhs! 2 and a half lakhs! How did you convince your dad?! Emotional blackmail! Papa, it's my only wedding! I've always wanted this! Etc... It's a great colour. I know! Did you talk to your dad yet? My brother flips out anytime I mention the designer gown! And Dad starts laughing! Kavya! Everyone must be ready for breakfast... hurry up! 2 minutes, sis! Just come to Delhi! You can help me with the wedding and you can buy your gown from here! The showrooms are going to get the latest stock of designer gowns, anyway! Yeah! Great idea! Okay, I'll call you later... Bye! - Wants to book trucks for 4 nights, but won't give an advance... What a miser! Let it go for now. Dad! We'll talk to Diwan after Diwali. Why are you shouting? Why didn't you give your measurements today? Dad, listen. I will only get married in Kareena Kapoor's designer gown. Otherwise say 'goodbye' to the groom! Why such a fuss over a damn gown! Son. Relax. What's the problem with a local gown? Grandma wore a local wedding gown. Hmph! My mother-in-law selected it. Horrible! With fake gold threading! The jewelry set that came with it was fake too! Dad... I'm only going to get married once. I didn't get to choose the groom. At least, let me choose the wedding gown! I didn't get to choose my groom or my gown! I've seen what happens when people get to choose... Dad, my wedding gown! Okay, how much is it for? Rs. 5 lakhs! Lt was only 2 until yesterday, now it's 5?! Gurpreet's gown costs Rs. 2 and a half lakhs! I deserve at least double that rate! You can't wear something so expensive. Look for something within Rs. 40-50 thousand. Why are you being so cheap?! We have so much money! So what if we have money! Next you'll ask for a send off in a helicopter! Money doesn't grow on trees! Dad! - He's right. Fine. I don't want your help. I'll buy my gown myself. Where are you going?! Delhi! To Uncle's house! I'll beg, borrow, steal, but I'll get my gown! Lf you want to rob, do it here in Ambala? Why do you need to go to Delhi?! By the time I earn Rs. 5 lakhs in Ambala, I'll be an old lady. You can earn big bucks only in big cities. Son... Call your uncle and tell him Kavya's coming to stay for a few days. Ok. Not just a few days! I'm only coming back after Gurpreet's wedding! With. My. Gown! Son... Stop taunting Swati. Stopping the taunts, won't heal the wounds, Mum. Swati, please. Don't say a word. I fell in love with the wrong man. Then I married him and humiliated dad. I should be punished. What punishment, Swati?! How is it your fault that he turned out to be a scoundrel? Lt IS my fault. Dad tried to stop me, but I didn't listen. Mom. Stop blaming yourself, child. Some relationships are meant to be short-lived. It's the Almighty's decision. Marrying Param was my decision, Mom. God isn't responsible for my mistakes. Forget about me. Go have fun in Delhi for a month! You won't get these days back. Everything will be different in America. Get a sexy wedding gown. Whatever you do, don't land up in jail! Shonty! You're sure Mr. Shastri is going to check the History paper, right? How many times do I have to tell you? I got the information straight from the office. He's been checking these papers for the last 5 years! Humpty! Lf the professor complains about you, they'll fail you! My dear Poplu... I'm going to fail anyway, right? Dude... since when do you care about passing?! Bro when heroes fail their exams in movies... ...their fathers give them a hug and send them on vacations to London. If I fail, my dad will kick me and tell me to manage the bookstore. Well, that's true... Hey... Good evening, Sir... Bro, he looks like Thakur from Sholay! Thakur didn't have hands, idiot. He looks like the dancing girl! Who are you guys? Sir, I'm Tendulkar, this is Kohli and that's Sehwag! Look, boys. You'll look like you'll are from a good home. Thank you, sir! Boys like you'll shouldn't be doing such things. Sir, when Gandhi's principles don't work, use Al Capone's. Sir, please pass me in History. I don't mind scraping through. I can pay you. I don't accept bribes. Just think of it as a donation... I even wrote a poem for you! One minute, sir. Listen. "My daddy cry, if I fail," "Then I hit you and go to jail." "But don't worry, I get easy bail." "Then I again hit you, again jail" "Again bail." "Jail-Bail, Jail-Bail, Jail-Bail" "And one day..." "Your heart fail." Wow! Oye! Monkey regiment! Come here! Who are you? Why are you messing around with my Uncle? Old man isn't passing me. Hanging him like this isn't going to help your cause. He's not accepting my bribe. I offered! How much? Five Thousand rupees. Do they need to pass? Nah nah. They're working now. Studying wasn't their thing. Hmmm. How will you get me passing marks? My Aunt's out of town... Uncle downs a few shots and passes out. I check half the papers. Give me your roll number, I'll sort it out. You're not from around here, are you? I'm an alien. E.T.'s sister. Why do you want to help me? You see... it was love at first sight. I want Rs. 10,000. Are you insane? Lf you want to bargain, you can get out. You're dangerous. I know. Now, get out. Humpty, hold on. Come on, let's go. What did the lady say? She said, "Humpty, you'll pass." Wow! Shonty, get the lowdown on her, man! Shut up! I do the work and you get the rewards! What kind of friend are you, man! What are you doing?! You know my blood sugar is high! We're celebrating your son passing his exams! Don't worry... just eat! Humpty, you passed?! Of course, sir! - But Didn't I tell you?! God's on my team. So, you passed! Who did you copy from? Dad! I'm your son! I'd die before cheating! Are you going to keep clowning around... ...or will you manage the shop? I'll manage it, Dad! I'm young! Lt's my time to have fun! Correct! Now that you're here, complete the inventory. You always take advantage of my innocence! Bro. - Hmm. Her name is Kavya Pratap Singh. From Ambala. She's Shastri's niece. Her dad is in the transport business. What's she doing in Delhi? Wedding shopping. She's engaged, man... to an NRI. The wedding's in a month and a half and then straight to America. Why are you looking so lovelorn? Humpty! Sorry dad! I've got to go! Next week onwards, I promise! Hello, Ms. Kavya! Wow, you look like you're Size 0! Are you mental? Why are you wearing a leather jacket in this heat?! You're so judgmental! I have high fever! And I still came to say thank you! Forget about it. You've come to hit on me! I don't hit on engaged property! I've done my research! Can't we sit and talk for a minute? No! Say what you want to like this! Well, you already know my name; Humpty Sharma! I'm very popular in my college! Girls think I'm really cute... Stop this introduction and say what you need to! There's a party... There's a party at my college. D. J... Drinks... delicious food. So? - So, I'm inviting you! Why me? Couldn't find anyone else? Quite a few. But you're the only one from Ambala. Will I be going as your sister or your girlfriend? Whichever you like! I'm open minded! Oh! My wedding is in 11/2 months! Oh. The party should be over way before that. What time? 6 pm onwards... you enter at 7! Ms. Kavya! The dress code is western! Don't show up in ethnic wear! Humpty! She's here! Let's go! Quick! I need to smell good! You'll never change, man. Let's go, let's goooo! Who are you? DJ Govind... Yo. Listen, nerd. Can you handle this? Yeah... Just give me a chance. Come on. "You can try and escape if you like" "But you know you can't always have your way" "You can go if you like" "But you know what we could get up to all night" "I'm single, you're single" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "I'm single, you're single" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Hand holding is so pass" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "You hold commitment at my throat like a knife" "Like your personal chauffer, behind you I drive" "Used to be a hero in my college, a real superstar" "But your love's ruined me" "When you dumped me, for a while I wept" "But for the first time that night, peacefully I slept" "Things became crystal clear that night" "I'm a macho man, so let's get lucky tonight" "Your luck is done, boy, done, done, done" "You have no idea how many suitors" "Think I'm the one, one, one" "I'm no stranger to how hearts work" "There's a trail of broken hearts wherever I go" "I won't follow you" "And I won't call you" "And I won't be your lovesick puppy" "Come, let me show you" "Oh I can show you" "A kind of love you won't forget" "I'm single, you're single" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "I'm single, you're single" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Hand holding is so pass" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "I'm single, you're single" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Let's get a little lucky tonight" "Come, let's get a little lucky tonight" I'm going! What? I'm going! Why so early?! She just got a call... There's a curfew! Should I drop you home? - Bye. Bro. Bro... Bro! Yeah! Lf staring worked, I'd be going out with the whole girls' hostel! What urgent work could have come up, Gurpreet?! You're behaving really weird these days! Hurry up! I'm waiting! Hello, Ms. Kavya! The cold coffee in this market is world famous! You again! I could leave! You can wait for your friend alone! Lt's bad manners to eavesdrop on other people's conversations. Can you lecture me while drinking cold coffee? Oh, fine. It'll be a good pass time. World class, isn't it! How would I know after one sip. Are all girls in Ambala so feisty? I'm not your guidebook, go find out yourself! What's your friend's full name, by the way? I've told you already. Tell me again. Gurpreet Sodhi. That's right... Sodhi! Why do you ask? I can't remember where I've heard her name... Don't get your hopes up... she's getting married in 3 weeks. By God... It's raining grooms. How's your wedding shopping going? Just alright... Still don't have enough money for my wedding gown. Didn't your parents give you any? Dad said no... He said it's too expensive. How much? I want a designer gown... It costs Rs. 5 lakhs! You've come here from Ambala to buy a gown for Rs. 5 lakhs?! Why is that funny? Get me a shirt along with your gown... For one thousand rupees! Stop laughing. So you're going to collect Rs. 5 lakhs in a month? Yes, I am. - How? I have a lot of great ideas! Tell me one idea. You won't be able to earn this money. Why not? Because you're not a con as you think, you are naive! Only 10,000 bucks for forging my marks? Even Rs. 50,000 would have been less! You're not a thief, Kavya! Enjoy Delhi for a few days, then go back to Ambala! Get a local gown... everyone will be happy! I don't need your stupid advice! Who are you to provide commentary to the world?! You can't even pass in History without help! Idiot! You should thank me and try to help... ...but instead, you're sitting there spouting rubbish! Oh, and I'm going to wear a designer gown... no matter what! Yeah... okay! Why are you poking around in her business? She's not your sister! Shonty... She's our sister-in-law! Bloody dung-for-brains... Talk sense sometimes, man! Awww! He's blushing! I feel things when I see her, man... Can't understand what you feel without touching. You don't have a girlfriend because you're so vulgar. Being classy won't help me, buddy... I'm stuck with this face! Stop this rubbish, guys... Humpty, she's getting married next month. I know that already, you don't have to keep reminding me... I'm worried she'll do something foolish trying to get this Rs. 5-lakh-gown! Dude, the one to worry about is her friend... You're right, man... I wish I could figure out who she is! Shonty! You're like my brother, right? Hello! Brother, not Google, you scoundrel... ...getting you information at a the touch of a button! So you're not going to do it?! No. You won't help? - Don't disturb. Just get the information, man! Just get it, bro... Okay! Okay! - First promise! I promise! Wow! Manish Malhotra's gowns! Lt'll really suit you! What? I'm not going to apologise! Just came to tell you that your friend is Trouble. I don't want to hear your rubbish! Lt's not rubbish, it's the truth. What is the truth? Tell me! Your friend is lying to you. Her gown is not designer. And I saw her with a boy... she's having an affair! What? Kavya! Kavya! Kavya, please believe me! You're useless! And I don't want to listen to your nonsense! Listen, I'm not useless! I'm the sole heir to my father's book empire! Are you applying for the post of most eligible Bachelor? You're just brushing it off... but you have to handle Gurpreet. Why are you so obsessed with her?! Does that make you jealous?! I'm not jealous! Listen to me... We can clear this up in a minute. Just come with me. Come on! This is Manish Malhotra's designer gown! Exactly like the one on your iPad, right? How much is it for? I want a fair discount... Rs. 90,000, final price. Huh?! How much did you say?! The one on your iPad was around Rs. 5 lakhs, right? What a discount! Wait. This is a Manish Malhotra original gown? Oh, yes. A hundred percent original fake. Sir, did Gurpreet Sodhi buy her wedding gown from here? Yes, she did! Any problems? Not at all, it's marvelous! Tell me something... ...how much would that gown be today? The original costs about Rs. 3 lakhs... We sold it to her for Rs. 70,000! Packaged exactly like the showroom. Your teeth will get dirty, if you don't stop laughing! Technically you should be apologizing to me, now... ...but forget it, I'm a very giving person. Drop me to Gurpreet's house. Talk to her... call me if you need anything. Thank you. Welcome. Bye. - Bye. I had ended the affair... But, then he started blackmailing me. I didn't even realize he took a video of me! Gurpreet, are you stupid? I wanted to buy the designer gown... But, he started demanding money. So I got a fake, inexpensive gown and gave him the money. That's when he deleted the video. Dad would have killed me, if he found out! Arts student, right? Yes. By the way... why is your name Humpty? I used to be a really fat kid... ...so, my friends used to call me Humpty. Since then, Rakesh became Humpty Rakesh?! What a boring name... He named me! 'Rakesh Sharma'! Rakesh Sharma... The astronaut. He was the first Indian to land on the moon. You're as pretty as the moon yourself. Hello? Vidya Book Centre! So, you're managing your father's book 'empire'! Yeah! So I'm not that useless after all, right? Oi! Don't be sarcastic! Why is your cell phone off? My battery is dead. Can you meet me today? - Why? That boy has blackmailed and looted Gurpreet. I can't believe you're still laughing! Sorry! What do you want to do? We have to teach the scoundrel a lesson! Get the money back... with interest! Why are you doing this?! Lt's over! Lt's not over! He got away... He's going to do this to someone else! Guys like this are scum! They don't think about the girl or her family! Did something happen to you, as well? I'd like to see someone try to mess with me! You're safe. Come on. Are you free tonight? There's a birthday party... Whose birthday? - Mine! What?! But, there's a different date on Facebook! Yeah, that's wrong... So you're following me on Facebook? Like you haven't checked my pictures out. I have... You look like a monkey in that white suit! Better than a baboon in a leather jacket! So you'll come? Well, why not... There'll be alcohol, right? You drink? - Yes... You drink regularly? Stop acting like a Mom! My bottle will be over before you've opened yours! What should I get for you? Leave it, Uncle! We've got plans tonight... It's your son's birthday... How many birthdays does he have in a year? Hello, Dad. Dad, Kavya... Kavya, Dad. Hello, Uncle. - Hello. Brothers... We have gathered to witness a great contest. Kavya has wagered that she can finish these two bottles of beer before me. Stop the lecture... let's drink. Poplu! Start the timer! 3... 2... 1! Go! Bro... She's like a Ferrari. Guzzle up! Wow! Don't worry, Humpty Dumpty! Stick with me and you'll learn to drink! I don't want to drink anymore... What?! Music! Come on! Kavya! - Humpty! You checked out my Facebook profile... but you didn't send me a friend request. Why should I? You send! What arrogance! That sucks... if I send, I'm desperate and if I don't I'm arrogant? What's an innocent boy to do? Innocent? You? My foot! By the way... today's not my birthday. I know. That's why I didn't get you a present. Don't worry. I'll handle Gurpreet's problem... ...and I'll get you your designer gown. Humpty's promise. Then you won't need to sell your earrings. I saw you the other day... I see, too... you want to buy a car? That's Dad's dream. A few years ago, he even booked one. Arranged the down payment, loan, everything... ...But, there was a fire in the shop. Rs. 20 lakh down the drain. Never managed to save enough after that... God knows when we'll get the car. Go to sleep, Poplu. Why do Indian girls like NRI's so much? Meaning? Gurpreet's boy is from Singapore... ...your's is from America. The Indian ratio is getting ruined! And, yeah... Doesn't matter if our income is high... ...because our outcome is always world class! Yuck... I didn't choose the boy. My dad chose him. So you'll marry a stranger? He's my dad's friend's son! I've met him before... We talk on Skype sometimes... You're such a modern girl! How could you agree to an arranged marriage? Modern girls don't have arranged marriages? They do. But they don't hang out alone in Delhi a month before. You know I've come to buy my gown... I'm not as stupid as I look... Wedding shopping happens with the family... We don't like to discuss the wedding in front of my sister... Is she single? She's divorced. Forget it. This is killing my buzz... Sorry... In movies they usually kiss at this moment... Don't watch so many movies then! Okay, it's not safe to go home so late, so I'll leave in the morning... Yeah... What are you doing, man! Bro... when girls leave you, you need your friends! You're even more beautiful in the mornings. I knew that last night would happen... ...that it would happen this way... I had no idea... What happened last night? What happens between a young man and young woman... Oh... - Yes. But you don't worry... I'm here for you... You psychopath! What are you doing?! I was joking! I know! I was drunk! I didn't lose my memory! Get rid of this romantic movie hangover... ...it'll get you in trouble! Hurry up! That boy will be coming! That's the scoundrel! This is Bhanu? He's the Principal's son... City dwelling modern type. Loves messing around with women. Come on! Let's go. Mrs. Chibber! You know her?! I know everyone! She's the Accounts' Professor's wife. She looks like a decent person. Decent?! She's a pervert! She's ruined poor Chibber Sir's life. Speaking from experience? Chibber ma'am... early morning with Bhanu! What are you doing?! Very bad! Early morning cardio... very good! Plan? Let's go! Name? Poplesh Sahai. You'll have to work in 12 hour shifts! And salary for the first month is Rs. 2 and a half thousand! You'll have Mondays off. Any problem? Not at all, sir! Can I start today? He always takes room 201. I've kept the stuff ready. Memorise your lines... and don't over-act. Oh... I was the best actor in my school. I don't need your tips. Swinging your pigtails on stage isn't acting. We have to fool Bhanu. If he figures it out, we'll all be screwed. Wow. What? You look hot... I was born hot! Concentrate on the job! Yeah... Chibber... Bhanu! Chibber... Bhanu! Chibber! Bhanuuu! Stop it! I'm showing you the exact position! Chibber! I mean... Shonty! Humpty! Bhanu's almost there! Get out of there quickly! Come on, Bhanu's coming! You're new here? Yes, sir... Room 201. Sir... Are you here with someone... or alone? Today I'm with someone... I could come alone tomorrow? I'm free from 4 am to 5 am... Bhanu... Bhanu... Bhanu... Chibber sir is so lucky, man... Lucky how?! Poor man, what a terrible wife... Don't worry... Chibber ma'am is turning over a new leaf tomorrow... Bhanu... Bhanu... You made this video?! You've done this?! - What do you want? I'll slap you! Just shut up! Tell me the truth! Lf Mr. Chibber sees... I don't care! Lf my dad sees this he'll kill me! What do you want from me?! Get ready in ten minutes, I'm coming! Where's that girl? What girl?! I'll break your face! Where's the girl who was here yesterday! We've never hired a girl here! Get out of here! Leave the money here and go. Don't try to be sneaky or your video will be leaked all over college. This is my wedding jewelry... Give. And listen. Never call me again. Why would I? You're like my son. Poplu, look at this money! What a perfect plan! I'm going to get a tuxedo... with a bowtie! You'll look like a waiter. What, man... Kavya keep it. Aren't you happy? These are Chibber ma'am's wedding jewels. We can't take this. Kavya, don't be emotional. They'll fetch a lot of money! You can buy your designer gown! I don't want it this way. Why do you look sad? Lt doesn't suit you! Just think how happy Gurpreet will be with the money! You've saved me. Thank you so much! Forget about it. Thank you so much! Forget it! Just stop hitting on me. Why don't we get hugs... we also helped! No... no... It's was a j-joke... Here! A hug and a kiss! What is this? We don't want to look at your sulky face anymore. It's our contribution for Kavya's gown! Keep it. Where did you get this money? We had set it aside for your dowry... It's not like anyone will want to marry you... ...we'd have to get a dowry bride! I need 2 and a half lakhs more. Okay. Keep this. I'd saved it for the down payment of the car. You can use it. You said we hadn't saved anything. It's called a secret stash... For use in emergencies. Don't talk rubbish, I'm not taking it. We can get a car after a couple of years... Kavya's wedding is now, right? Besides, how is a car going to change anything? You'll drive, me besides you and these two at the back! You've only met her once! Don't act so righteous! I'm your father, not a fool. It's an advance... from your salary! So you'll have to work for free for the next three years! Lt's okay... I'll buy your beer. Chilled! Relax! Relax! Aww! So sweet, man! What are you doing?! Why do you want an empty bag? Where did you get the money? From the bank. Robbed it at gunpoint. Humpty... be honest. I didn't do anything wrong to get it... I promised you a designer gown... I don't break my promises. I can't take it. Think of it as a loan. Return it to me in dollars after the wedding. Scoundrel... ...you managed it after all. You shrew... If you had picked a gown for 10 lakhs... ...I'd have got that for you, too. What? Nothing. I should leave... Thank you. Don't get emotional. "This Punjabi firecracker" "She's a total fashionista" "I've been seeing her around everyday" "She's a black magic woman" "And she wants a piece of my heart" "And I've been noticing her around" "Who knows who he's dreaming of?"

After Gurpreet's wedding ceremony. Stay back a few days... Dad's calling me back... The wedding preparations are starting. So this is the last time I'll see you. Why? Aren't you coming tomorrow? You helped me... helped Gurpreet... I can't come. Now what? Now shut your eyes and sleep. Do you love me? My sister loved a boy once... Dad didn't like him. But she married him, anyway. The boy turned out to be a dog. He began beating my sister. She came back home... ...but my dad has never forgiven her. He's opened a cyber caf for her... ...but he's always taunting her. My father doesn't believe in love. Angad is his choice. I can't break his heart. How much you talk. Such a long answer for such a simple question... Do you love me? I can't sleep... Wanna hear a poem? In English? Will that make me sleepy? Guaranteed! Okay... "Tomorrow you will go... My life will again become slow... In wedding finery, your face will glow... Like Shakespeare, my beard will grow..." Kavya? Kavya? Give him this for now, we'll settle the rest later... Dad! We're going to need a split airconditioner. Okay, so get it. I don't want any problems with cooling. Don't worry, sir! You have my word! Think before you speak. My to-be-son-in-law is coming. If he's even slightly uncomfortable, I'll shut down your dealership. Granny... Kavya's looking grown up after her Delhi trip. No... I'm just tanned from the sun. I can't believe she's back without her designer gown. I'm very upset! Why, Granny? Try and understand... She can't show off your designer gown to Angad's granny now! I looked everywhere! Nothing really suited me... These designer gowns suit girls from the city... ...for you... local tailor! Best! You didn't leave anything behind, did you? What's left behind is gone now. I have to prepare myself for America. Single Line Registers... 50 hard covers, 50 soft covers. 50 long notebooks, 50 small notebooks. No, only 25 small notebooks... they sell slowly. People will keep buying them! Nobody buys anything... They'll just become trash! Can you'll be quiet?! Humpty's very serious about work, these days! Ever since I've joined, you've become lazy. Your days of frolicking are over... now, mine have begun! Point! Excuse me? Mr. Humpty Sharma? Yeah, that's me. Sir, congratulations on your new car! The new Celerio... with Drive EZ Technology... Just this, that's it! Drive easy. Dad, did you... No! I didn't! I haven't bought a car, sir. I know, sir. This is a gift for you. From Kavya Pratap Singh. Did you watch the match? Which match? Bangladesh vs. Kenya? Who would watch that... Do you like the surprise? Are you crazy?! Stop trying to be heroic! Aren't you happy to see me? I'm very happy. But, if my brother sees- He'll kill me? You relax. Your wedding will be on time. Everyone's under your spell... You bought us a new car! My dad says it's wonderful... ...the car... ...and you. Humpty... please... leave. I had to get you something in return for your gift... Humpty... you... Oh, don't get sentimental. Tell me, are you happy to see me? Very happy. Let's go talk to your father. Are you insane? I'm getting married! My father will kill you! Sooner or later we'll have to tell them how we feel! You can take your feelings and get lost! Kavya... If I see you again, I'll shoot you myself! Kavya! She didn't even say hi. Thank God she didn't! I don't want to die here. Oye! What now? I've come from Delhi with Kavya's wedding gown. Come, dear! Rakesh was just telling us how he came to be called Humpty! Since, when did designers start having Lucky Draw Raffles? What? I was just telling them how there was a Raffle in our store... ...for to-be brides. You won, ma'am! Wow! Kavya, what luck! Amongst how many did she win? Sir, 150 people! Lt's a good story. Son, this glass from which you're drinking... ...this mansion... ...in which you stand... ...it's a result of very hard work. I've earned a lot of respect. I'm not as gullible as you think I am... Put the glass down. Tell me the truth. Sir, my name is Humpty Sharma. I met Kavya by accident at her uncle's house. When I researched... When I asked around about her, I found out she's betrothed. But, I wasn't convinced. I kept finding excuses to meet her. I thought we could be friends at least... And when she has to leave, I'll control my feelings. But, then love struck, sir... To me... ...and to Kavya. So, I came to talk to you. What the hell will you talk about?! Lf you wanted to talk, you wouldn't have wasted time with this drama. Sir, it's not like that, I really did come to talk. Ranjit, take him away. Come on! Dad! Come on, you scoundrel! Please listen to me. Enough Ranjit. Take them back to Delhi. I told him not to come, Mom... ...I don't know why he's here. He's mad. I'm scared of what my husband will do. I know my son. He won't do a thing. Do you love him? Yes. You can just forget about it right now! I would have killed him, if Dad hadn't stopped me. Forget what happened in Delhi and today. Angad is coming in two days. I don't want any trouble till the wedding. Why are you laughing? I'm laughing from the pain! Shonty, why aren't you laughing? My backside is wrecked. The truck driver went into every damn pothole, man! Your father-in-law is a great guy, Humpty! At least he gave us a lift to Delhi! Wish he'd given us some food too... I'm so hungry, man! I can smell the tandoori chicken... Oh, Humpty! Let's be serious for a minute... Okay... Forget her now, man... If I hadn't gone to Ambala, I'd have forgotten her, man... ...But, when I saw her in the gurudwara... I fell in love again! Lt's still never happened for me and... ...this guy has fallen for the same girl twice! Hello? Ya, Swati? Kavya, Humpty's back. Come outside, quickly! "Don't want to live without you..." "Don't want to live without you..." "Don't want to live without you..." "Don't want to live without you..." "How do I explain to you?" "How my heart is anxious without you..." "How do I explain to you?" "How my heart is anxious without you..." "What do you know of my love?" "Or of how I wait for you..." "You are my heart, my very life" "How do I explain to you?" "How my heart is anxious without you..." "What do you know of my love?" "Or of how I wait for you..." "You are my heart, my very being" "How do I explain to you?" "How my heart is anxious without you..." "Our hearts' paths are one" "When you walk with me, the rains walk with us..." "My life... oh..." "Is now yours, how can I help that?" "Have faith in me..." "I will wait for you" "You are my heart, my very life" "How do I explain to you?" "How my heart is anxious without you..." I know something about you, sir... Really. You definitely had a love marriage. So, you met Kavya. Yes... but she didn't tell me, sir. You and your wife aren't from the same caste... ...I figured it out, myself. If you're so smart... ...why have to come back to die in Ambala? How long can one run from death, sir? So, you're not opposed to love, sir! A few incidents have soured... Shut up! Don't you dare talk about Swati. This is my final warning. If I see you in Ambala again... ...only your corpse will return to Delhi. Dad, Humpty's a very nice boy. Just give him a chance! Shut up, Kavya! Why? Are you going to hit me as well? He's come here for me! He loves me! He shouldn't love you. He knows you're betrothed to someone. So what?! I fell in love with him too, didn't I? Then get over it. I can't get over it! Too bad, keep crying then! You will only marry Angad! Why are you ruining my life? A father's life is ruined, when a daughter's marriage breaks. Dad, you can't shut everyone up by bringing up... ...Swati in every situation! What if Angad is a scoundrel like Param? Humpty's a good person, Dad! He came back for me, despite being beaten so badly! Please, Dad! At least meet him! Please, Dad, please! For me! Just once! For me! Please. Okay. Call him here. Pick up that glass. I said, pick up the glass! Kavya is going to marry Angad. And I don't want her to think that... ...her father didn't give her love a chance. Tomorrow onwards, you're on Angad duty. For the next 5 days... ...you can find out anything you like about him. Find one reason why Angad is wrong for Kavya. Just one. I'll let Kavya marry you. To hell with what people will think. Remember. I'm trusting you. Don't break my trust. You love Kavya, don't you? Now, her future is in your hands. However, if you can't find a reason... ...I want you gone on the 6th day. What kind of cot is this! Such injustice! Do something, man! Got inside your house, didn't I? You're a loser! You're destined to be with this loser. Don't be cheeky. We're in the same house now and you're babbling away on the phone. What do you want?! I don't think you actually dare to come and see me in person! Oh, really? Now that I'm here, I won't leave empty-handed... You haven't said it yet. Said what? That. What's that? Oh. Thaaat! Say it, quickly. Didn't you hear me announcing it your father? Say it to me. I don't care who else you've said it to. When Shahrukh Khan spreads his arms and says it, he looks like a hero. I'll look like a fool. I don't care, say it! You say it, first! Say it, or I'll scream! I love you. I know. Now you say it! Not in the mood! This... this is Angad? Bro, you've won! Kavya is yours! Congratulations! Uhh... Humpty Sharma? Dude... is this guy a doctor or a model?! This is great, huh? First they hit us, then they party. Have a drink! No, I don't drink... It's a large shot! This is why I have told you to curb your drinking. I don't drink too much, I just get high fast! Is everything alright? I'm a doctor. Ya... Angad. - I'm Humpty. This is Shonty. Interesting names. Mine's the most interesting... Poplu! You... don't drink? No. Tried it in college. But it's not for me. You should have a drink sometimes... It helps you relax. I don't think so. A drunken man thinks with his heart, not his mind. Well, we're Punjabi. No mind, all heart. I'm Punjabi, too. But, the intellectual kind. I like to be in control. If he wasn't engaged to Kavya, I'd marry him. Hi, you beast. Don't. I'm high! Don't you want to take advantage? No. Why didn't you tell me Angad was such a stud? Everyone looks like a stud on Skype. Aww, you're jealous! I was jealous when I saw him in the morning. Now I'm scared out of my wits! Stop laughing! And that brother of yours... - Aye! What? - Don't say a word about him. You remember how he beat me? And now he's giggling like a heroine with Angad. Stop wasting time, Rakesh. Give me a sexy smile. Looks like it's been years since you pulled one, Sir. I want to say something, if you don't mind. He's way older than Kavya. By 5 or 6 years, at least! Lt's not a good match. My wife is 5 years younger than me. Everything matches, eventually. Dad's called you to go jogging. Falling for you was a big mistake. He's called Angad, as well. To be a towel holder. Have you ever jogged in your life? I was a champion athlete in school and college! Liar. I look like Milkha Singh when I run! Hi, Uncle! Are you having fun, son? Yes, Uncle! One more lap. Good Morning. I was afraid you'd run away with Kavya... ...but, it doesn't look like you'll get very far. Look at him; a real, macho Punjabi! Come on, Humpty! - Ya... Humpty! Don't eat! I'm making spaghetti ravioli and risotto with garlic bread! I want everyone to enjoy it. Yeah... yeah... Make sure you don't eat anything. Definitely. Granny! Granny! What rubbish is he making?! You will all get indigestion! He's making Italian food! Let the Italians eat Italian food! We're Indians! We want Indian food, right?! Oh, Humpty. These men from abroad are the best. They cook, they clean... What do you say? Of course! Indian men are useless! Sitting with their feet up, with the newspaper... Get me tea, get me food! That's all! All Indian men are not like that, Granny. All the men we've seen are like that. Do you like my sweater, sir? Exactly like yours, right? Nice. How did you like Angad's cooking? Yeah... very nice. Humpty! Move! Leave me! You call this a salad? Lt's a Delhi speciality! Look at this, Humpty! Look at this, Humpty! - Look at what? Stop laughing! Oye! Singh sir is asking for you. Where are we going, sir?! Why? Lf I don't tell you, you won't go? Train station. Now don't ask me who's coming. See for yourself. Sir, I'm Tendulkar. He's Kohli. And that's Sehwag. You're the same one who hung me from the swing, right? No, sir. That's my twin brother, sir! He's Shyam... I'm Ram. Humpty Dumpty! Uncle said their driver was very cute. You're smoking again! What happened, why do you look so tensed? Do you love me? No. I'm being serious. Of course I do. Why do you love me? What does that mean? I mean... why? What do I have that Angad doesn't? I don't know. You don't know?! Love isn't by reason, Humpty. Shouldn't there be a reason? What do I say when Sir asks me why I'm better for you than Angad? He's better looking than me, he earns more than me... ...he's fit, he doesn't drink... ...he even cooks! He's friggin' Superman! I'm barely Charlie Brown. Yeah. Correct! You're right... Shall I marry him? Bloody sympathy monger... When I say I love you, I mean it! Stop these crocodile tears. - Oh, Humpty! Okay... bye! Hello, sister-in-law! What happened to you?! I can't... What's wrong with Poplu? School topper, college topper... ...scholarship to university, and first in his class in Medicine... ...and still... And still, what? And still I can't figure it out... ...how is Angad so perfect? So what if he is? Either he's an angel in disguise... ...or... ...he's hiding something. What is he hiding? The dude is gay! Don't talk rubbish! He's gay! Look! Look at this! Kissing, hugging... everything! Okay, look at the other guy's name... Ricky! Are you sure? Hundred percent sure! I got it off Facebook... tell him! And look at what Ricky wrote... 'The love of my life'! What is this, man?! What is it? Lt's like thiiiis! What else could it be? This could be incorrect! Hello! Shonty has never been wrong... nor will he ever be. Okay? Bro, I've saved your wedding! Say thank you and let's go to Singh sir. Are you stupid?! You want me to take this paper to Singh sir? I need hard evidence! We need to hear Angad say it! "I am GAY." People suffer from such sad things... Thought he was a stud... but he's gay... Brooo... You... are you insane?! I didn't ask for a bath! What happened?! Why are you sulking?! I don't want to talk to you! I'm sorry, Kavya! I waited all night for you thinking you'd come! You didn't even answer your phone! I'm sorry! I fell asleep, I was tired! But listen, I have good news! Yeah! You sleep while I get married off to Angad! But listen to my good news! I have good news!!! You remember what to do, right? Yes! Humpty, please, I can't do this! Sorry! Shut up and go! Hey! Can I ask you something? Lt's a little personal... Sure... go ahead! You have such a good personality... ...People must hit on you all time? Yeah, sometimes! Men... Women... both? Ya... but that's kind of normal, right? Yeah, now it's normal in India also! Society's becoming open-minded! That's good to know... You don't need to be afraid or hide... Everything is open! Hey, what's up? What are you doing here? Lt's important to nourish yourself... Thanks... I can't do this anymore, man! Lf Angad isn't, I'll definitely be gay by the end of this! What are you doing here? Granny's making pickle for Angad's family... She sent us to get these jars! You tell your family! I'm going to be the groom! Not a waiter! I don't want to eat. I'm sorry for this morning... I was angry! Sorry about last night. The bread is burnt... ...and the soup is bland. The side dish is average... But, I'll cook for you everyday... ...and I'll become perfect. I don't want perfect. I'll have whatever you give me. For now, take a slap. Now you eat. No, I... No, eat. It's very good, best in Ambala! "I feel naughty naughty" "I feel naughty naughty" "I feel naughty naughty" "The wisemen couldn't tell you Did the chicken come before the egg?" "Leave the lofty thinking And listen to my tale!" "The wisemen couldn't tell you Did the chicken come before the egg?" "Leave the lofty thinking And listen to my tale!" "The hen, she cried all night And she couldn't sleep a wink" "The rooster must've been naughty Eggs don't come by magic!" "Oh, when I watch you dance..." "Oh, when I watch you dance..." "I feel naughty naughty" "I feel naughty naughty" "Oh, when I watch you dance" "Oh, when I watch you dance" "I feel naughty naughty" "I feel naughty naughty" "Oh, everyone feels naughty naughty" "Forget your silly tales of fantasy and love" "I met your grandfather when he was only but a boy" "Just a little girl was I when I became his bride" "Sent away from home as a naive little child" "All night I cried and tried but couldn't sleep" "When grandfather whispered softly" "Oh, when I watch you dance" "Oh, when I watch you dance" "I feel naughty naughty" "I feel naughty naughty" "Oh, everyone feels naughty naughty" "Come now, listen closely to my saga" "I was a college student and your father a mechanic" "When he caught my hand and said, listen to me my darling!" "However, whenever, wherever, I'll marry only you." Ask him what happened after! "Naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty" "Landed up at her father's house, and he didn't listen to a word" "But his beatings couldn't shake me off" "And he finally let her be my bride Oh, then she became my bride" "Then naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty" "We got naughty naughty" "Oh we got naughty naughty" "When I see you dance" "We got naughty naughty" "My heart feels naughty naughty" "Nevermind what they say, I know my love was true..." "But what I thought was destiny was not really meant to be" "lt was not meant to be" "No one knows what fate has planned" "Forget the past, the future is bright" "Come on, dear girl, give us a smile..." "Come now, give us a smile..." "Oh when I see you dance..." "I feel naughty naughty" "I feel naughty naughty" "Oh, when I watch you dance" "I feel naughty naughty" "I feel naughty naughty" "Oh, when I watch you dance" "Oh, when I watch you dance" "I feel naughty naughty" "I feel naughty naughty" "Oh, everyone feels naughty naughty" lt's okay. Everything will be alright. What are you talking about? I didn't understand... I've been noticing you all day. I know you love me. But, it's not possible. Why?! Because you love Ricky? Ricky? Don't lie... It's on Facebook! Poplu, Ricky is my best friend! He's gay... I'm not! I like women. Poplu... you're a great guy... ...but, I'm sorry. No problem. It's okay. Have you told your friends that you're gay? Lf you want... ...I'll come with you. No... not now. I'll tell them later! This was your stupid plan? I told them that! Instead, they sacrificed my masculinity... Kavya, I'm trying! Not a word from you! Lf you can't do anything, go back to Delhi! Stop these immature antics! My marriage is next week! I told you! Get lost! I'm not talking to you guys! No more ideas, please! Please! Do you know this boy well? No... Just met him when he came to tie me up. You can't laugh at me, brother-in-law! Lts in your fate to be tied up! Remember how I had tied you to the tree? He was a big help to Kavya's friend, Gurpreet. He saved her marriage. Your dad used to be a mechanic? My bike's carburetor needs to be cleaned... ...can I call him? Who will clean your dirty mind? You're the mechanic of my body, baby. Yuck! Weirdo... Go to sleep, now... Jogging in the morning... Nooo... Angad didn't come today, sir? He doesn't jog to impress me. I don't jog to impress you, either. I jog for Kavya sake. Maybe I can learn something from Angad and be a better person for Kavya. Is that why you smoke cigarettes? The cigarettes are for me... ...I can become a better for Kavya, but can't fundamentally change. Kavya... Kavya... Kavya... Did you need something? Can't I talk to you without needing something? Just kidding. I want to take you for dinner. Just the two of us. We're getting married in a week... ...we should get to know each other. So, I wanted to spend some time with you. There are too many people in the house for us to talk freely. So, tonight? You and me. It's a date. Bye. - Bye. You're the first man in the world, making pickles for his competitor. Oh, wow, she looks angry! What the hell are you doing?! What the hell are YOU doing?! Are you here to marry me or attend Angad's wedding?! What's wrong? Angad's parents are coming tomorrow itself! Now, you have only tonight. Tomorrow my father will ask you why Angad is wrong for me. What are you going to say? Don't look away, Humpty! What do I do?! What do I do if Angad is Mr. Perfect?! Beat him? Threaten him? Kill him?! Do nothing! Sit here and make pickle! He wants to take me on a date! I don't want to go on a date... Don't go, Kavya... Do something, Humpty... ...Do something. Humpty won't come today. One... two... three! He's just like you. He has honesty in his eyes. He loves Kavya very much. I'm going to Delhi tomorrow to pick my parents. I'd like you to come with me. Angad... those boys are staring at me. Ignore them. You're concerned that he doesn't earn enough? You were the same when... Please stop, both of you! My decision is... final. Son, your problem is that you want to control everything. You can control your children's lives... ...but you can't control what life has in store for them. "Oh, these mesmerizing eyes..." Kavya! Don't look at them... They're drunk! I didn't control Swati... ...look what happened! So you can assure Kavya's happiness by controlling her? Can you guarantee that she will never cry? That she will always be cheerful and happy? Go on, give us a guarantee! Kavya, don't react! We'll finish our dinner and leave. One more beer, please! Ohhh, she's pissed off! Lf God himself can't control the fate of the world... ...who are you to control anyone's destiny? Don't! Put the phone down. "Some boys are being sleazy with me..." Angad is a good man, Ma. He's a very good man... ...but, Humpty is the best person for your precious Kavya. He's being openly lewd! What do you want me to do? Beat him? Do something! Don't just sit there! Kavya... I've asked for the bill. Let's pay and leave. There's no point fighting with them. What are you looking at?! Oh, Lady Gaga... where are you going? Aren't you going to have a drink with me? Listen, buddy. We don't want any trouble. Look at this English Gentleman! Humpty! Stop it, Humpty! Let me go! Humpty! Humpty, don't! Singh sir, please don't thank us. Your kids are like our kids. Good thing Angad called us in time... Can you come with me? I want to lodge a complaint. Don't let those guys go. Angad... ...bring them home. They're in no state to drive. You all were rooting for this man? I want you to leave first thing tomorrow. And never show your face here again. Kavya... Kavya... Kavya. Kavya, hurry up, we have to leave in half an hour! Kavya? Kavya? Humpty! Where's Kavya? I don't know... Don't lie! You're going to run away with her! Can you tell me what's going on? Kavya's not at home, she's not answering her phone! Tell me where she is! Lf I had run away with her, why would I come back? We didn't even talk last night! She's crazy! Angad is leaving in 10 minutes. If Dad finds out... - Nothing will happen. You handle Sir and Angad, we'll find Kavya. Shonty! Humpty! You go, we'll handle things here! I'm getting a bad feeling that we're going to get hit... Sir, Bus Stop! Everyone will come here first, and then go to the hotel. Kavya's asked you'll to go ahead... her stomach is upset. She wants to set everything up for your family members. Nothing serious, I hope? No. Must be from eating out. You leave. Don't get late. Where is she? Where is she? I don't know anything, I was sleeping! Tell me where they are! Listen to us at least! Sir, they haven't run away together. He's gone to bring her back. Kavya, are you crazy? Where are you?! Yes, I'm alone! Where are you? Are you okay? What are you doing there? Wait there. I'm coming! Where are you, man? He found Kavya! What's going on? Get inside, the train is going to leave. Let it go, you get down. Get down! This is why I didn't tell you last night! I knew you'd do this drama! Kavya, stop this nonsense... get down! Sir is so worried! Sir is worried?! Do you care about him or me?! Let's go from here! We'll think of something! Think of what?! What will we talk about? Dad will just beat you and throw you out! Then, you'll be in Delhi and I'll be in America! I will make my own life decisions! Not you and Dad! Now get in! Will you be happy like this? Can you live without your family?! Stop with the dialogues! Get in! Oh, really? - Yes! Okay, your decision is final. Let's run away. To hell with the family! Why did you leave empty handed? You could have taken your expensive gown with you, at least? You cheap man! This was your plan?! Enough, sir! We didn't try to elope! Lf we were eloping, we'd be on the train by now! Not waiting for you on the platform! Come to the corner there. I want to talk to you... man to man. Why is he pacing like this? The pressure must be getting to him... Firstly, it frightens me out of my wits when you glare. I've got lots to say but, nothing comes out in front of you. But today, I need to speak. I apologize for the next 5 minutes, because you won't be Mr. Singh for me. You'll be Poplu. My friend, my brother... In front of whom I can speak freely. Oye, Poplu! What's the mechanic's problem?! Why is he the only one who can't see our love? Angad is a great guy... He has a big heart! Big everything! He's a tree, I'm a shrub! Small, insignificant... But, what's the guarantee that he'll make Kavya happy? That he'll love her? I have a lot of faults... but one guarantee. This shrub loves Kavya. If we only have one piece of bread... I'll give Kavya half and half to Dad. I'll never let her sleep hungry. Don't glare at me like Mr. Singh! Lf every father insisted on a perfect boy for their daughters... ...even Mr. Singh would still be a bachelor. But who can explain this to him? People aren't perfect... relationships are perfect! And anyone who is lewd with Kavya will get beaten. Whether there are 8 people or 80... makes no difference. In my place, Mr. Singh would have done the same. Can anyone so much as look at his wife? My brain is small, but my heart is big. If the mechanic can understand... great. And, Poplu... if anyone so much as touches you'll... I'll bury all of them in Ambala. Jai Mata Di. "You didn't do right with me" "You didn't do right with me" "By breaking my heart" "These eyes are regretting it so much" "These eyes are regretting it so much" "By bonding with you" "In my prayers... Oh..." "Are only good wishes for you..." "Listen to my proposal of adoration" "I wait only for you..." "You are my heart, my very being" "How do I explain, my dear..." "My heart is anxious without you" Send the cars to the hotel! Put Kavya's stuff in the car! Why are you wearing this local gown? Wear the designer one... Since, you've been driving everyone crazy about it for 3 months? Designer didn't suit me... Local is best for me. When I didn't understand love... ...this gown meant everything to me. Now, that I know love... the gown has no value. Wish I could exchange my designer groom for a local one. Hurry up. The wedding procession is almost here. Stop it, Pop- Sir?! Lf you call me Poplu again, I'll bury you. Come on. Don't be so emotional. Go, live your life! Humpty Sharma! We live only once... Die only once... and... I forget what comes next. Hurry up, Humpty! I've been waiting for you for a long time. You look hot. I was born hot! Did you die when you saw my Facebook status? I thought... you left with that hunk. Are you crazy? I love you, man! I love you, too. "She's a small town girl" "She's a small town girl" "Living in her small town world" "She's here to party like there's no tomorrow" "This girl parties everyday like it's Saturday!"
