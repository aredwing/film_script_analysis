Yeah, it's just over there. Oh! Listen, um, I'm, uh.. I'm really sorry, you know for sleepin' here last night. Okay, so.. I've been staying at my friend Diana's but she's really fuckin' crazy. So crazy that I had to get the fuck out of there. I tried sleepin' in my truck but then these cops kept bothering me and... and then I found this place and it was really cute so I just came in. It was open. Cool. Umm.. Sarah. I'm Pepper. Nice to meet you. Oh, wow. That's really good. - Oh, my God. - Oh, no. I was just being.. That was me being...

Scared I have cooties? Come on. Aah! Aah! It's like water to me. Are you from around here? I just moved here from Vegas. So what do you do here for fun? Umm, I just kind of hang out. Spend a lot of time here, I guess. Oh, this is really cool. You got one on sharks? I watched those sometimes. Animals' lives are so much more interesting than humans. Oh, my God! Those are pretty cool. Intelligent octopus. That's what I am. - You're an octopus? - Check this out. They can camouflage themselves to whatever surrounding you know that there is. I'm an octopus.

Alright, grab your stuff. I'll wait right here. I think I'm gonna stay here tonight. Oh, come on, now, you know your mom doesn't like you sleeping here. Well, you know she doesn't have to know. Okay. Alright, I'll stay with you. Well, I was kinda thinking that maybe I needed some alone time. You know, I'm gonna go hand out some resumes tomorrow and.. - Right. - Focus. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, it's probably better. But we could hang out after. Yeah, sure. - Don't be upset. - I'm... I'm not. Okay. - Sleep well. - Okay. Hey, you. Hi. Are you good at folding blankets? Not really.

I wouldn't mind. I mean.. I found a movie on Africa we... we could watch. I think I have a couple of beers. Well, I have a better idea. Come on. Let's go. Oh, that's more like that. - Will you just stop. - It's good luck. It's good luck. Oh, what's that? - Hi. - Hi. - What would you like? - I'll have this. Hmm, but what's in it? What's in that? Um.. Lime juice, tequila, um.. - Okay, sounds good. - Triple sec. I'm gonna give her a good ass tip. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey! What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, how're you ladies doing? We're good. You know, we're just trying to make a buck and waiting to die like everyone else. Well, I'm Chase. I'm Francesca and this is Dawnie. - Hi, Dawn. - Hi. - Where are you from? - Willowpea. - Can I buy you ladies a drink? - Oh, we're fine. We have drinks. Alright, uh, how about a shot? Anything, whatever you want. Ooh, whatever I want. We wanna play blackjack. We want to play.. Against you. Yeah. With your money. You wanna gamble with my money, against me? Yeah.

I got a gig.. At, uh, this bar called Blue Room? - You're a stripper? - No. No, I'm not a stripper. I'm a bartender. It's not that bad. You should come by sometime. I'm drowning. Save me. - Now you're drowning. - Save me. Ah! You weren't afraid. Where did your necklace come from? It's from Seattle. I'm going to move there. Why? Because in Seattle there is mountains. They have fish market, and they have.. The ocean. I've never been to the ocean. You've never been to the ocean? That's like... you know, things tears are made of. My parents never took me. I tried to run away once. - You tried to run away? - Yeah. How feisty. I walked to the end of the town and this.. Guy pulled over and asked me if I needed a ride and I got scared and I went home. Maybe, maybe that was your. Out of Jail Card? Or maybe it was my death trap. I mean, yeah, he could have slit your throat and.. And raped you, but so could a man crossing the street. Maybe some things are supposed to happen. Like, maybe I'm supposed to stay here forever. Let's face it, 10 years, I'm here.. I've 3 kids, breast cancer.. And my husband will have, like, a really big beer gut. I'm sorry if that's your fate. But maybe it's not, you know? I've done... a lot of things.. And I have, I have a lot to learn. But... you know, I'd say.. One thing.. That I've learned that's true.. Is that.. If you don't make your own choices in life.. The world will make them for you. That can be very dangerous. I'm a dolphin. Hi, John. Suzy, come on, play in your own room. This is gross. Yeah, okay. You got fired from Super Town? John wants to talk to you. - Hello. - Hey, kiddo. I told your mom that if you wanna do some temp work in my agency, we can help you out. Okay. I'm here for you. I'm worried about you. - Thanks. - Let me talk to Linda. Hold on, John. Did you put money in the drawer? Right. So you said you've worked as a cashier before. Every couple of hours, you'll do a walk around make sure everything looks decent. Make sure that there's condiments and napkins on every table. Make sure that you watch out for spills. You know, if it gets sticky there and somebody falls.. Ugh, you know, that could be a disaster. You can start on Monday. So did any of those girl check come after you? After, like, those.. One of them did. And Alison gave me two black eyes. - Oh, gosh! - Two days before I.. - Oh, man! - It was awesome. You know what? - What? - Because I had already had a.. Uhhuh. -And she said the first words, "Stay away from John." Oh, wow. - Can I buy? - Thank you. Hi, honey, how are you? Oh, come on, guys. What else do you have to spend your money on?

I'll put these on you. Is trying a new approach to further test this incredible animal's thought process. Stromboli may offer a natural habitat.. Here you go,madame. Because this should be the perfect location. What is it about the octopus' intelligence? I wanna be an animal too. To predict disaster. - I know what you'd be. - What? - A meerkat. - Why? 'Cause, um.. Well, I don't know you that well, but... they're smart and they can eat scorpions. I've never eaten a scorpion before. You've ever googled abnormally large clitorises? - Boy, you're crazy. - I'm not crazy. That's what they look like. - I'm pretty like this? - Yeah. I like you better without the mask. Me too. - You are new here, aren't you? - Mm-hmm. - What's your name? - Sahara. Sahara. Where's your accent from? - England. - Oh, right. Yeah. - Hi, daddy. - Oh, my. My little angel.

But I wanna know why, uh I gotta be selling to you when you've been beggin'. These things don't even go right. You know what I'm saying? - Yes. - Yeah. - Go have fun. - Always, baby. You know it. You have a good night. Hey, so, uh the guy from Vegas came in looking for you last night. Yeah? What did you tell him? I really didn't know what to tell him other than, you weren't staying with me anymore. Well, if he comes in again, just tell him I left. Oh, he said you owe him a lot of money. Yeah, well, that's what they all say. You know and I gave you a place to crash and hooked you up with the club so... just don't get me in trouble, okay? Don't even bother with that one. He'll just talk your ear off and not even pay for your drink. - You know him? - No, but I can just tell. See Ginger over there? She spends all night doing laps around the room. Hustling all the customers. Not me. I will sit here and enjoy my drink until I see the right guy. And how do you know he's the right one? Just observe, honey. Okay. You see that man over there? Just look at him, he's scared of us. You're lucky if you get one lap dance out of me. See that cocky bastard over there? He'll wave you over, you know, tip you a few dollars tell you there's more where that came from. He doesn't even really have any money to spend on you. This place is like a little Petri dish. You know, there's some locals and they're good for tips on stage. There's the freaks. There's pervs. Saviors. The one you really wanna be looking for.. Is totally confident, you know. He doesn't have to prove it, he just is. He may look like he doesn't have money but there's something special about him. He knows the difference between what's real and what's not and if you're real with him.. You walk away with so much money. Sometimes you just have to sit and talk with him, you know? 'Cause at the end of the night the most important interaction.. Comes from your soul. Hey. You look pretty. So I gotta get out of town for the weekend.. 'Cause, uh.. You wanna come with me? How's my hair? You look great. You look much better like that. Oh, my God. Is that you? You're so cute. You have glasses. Oh. Why did you throw that away? 'Cause it's not me anymore. Where are we going? I wanna take you to one of my favorite places. When I was younger I used to sit by the window at night.. And say.. "Dear God.." "Dear God, if you want me to believe in you, you have to show me a sign." And did God show you a sign? Like, like a burning bush? No. But, um.. I don't know. Maybe you're not supposed to be so demanding. Or I'll just start dealing. It's complicated, you know? I mean, I'd rather be doing what I'm doing than doing some nine-to-five job. It can be exactly like dancing, you know? It's like an addiction. I'm addicted to it. It could be like a black hole that just pulls you.. Under. And then it's very hard to get out. And the longer you do it the harder it is. I mean, I should've stopped a long time ago. If you stop, I'll stop. Good deal. Hey, look. It's peyote. You're taking with me? Okay. Okay. Hi, honey. It's cold. Come in here. In your little world. I like you. I like you too. You're beautiful. You're working today? - Yeah. - You look nice. Thanks, mom. I'm heading to the store, you want me to pick up something for you? It's okay. I can do it. Okay. Mikey, come to register 2, you have a phone call. Don't forget this. How would you like to pay for all this? Cash. How much is it? $97.22. You can keep the change. - It hurts. - Hold still. - Hey, grandpa. - Hi, sweetie. - What's this? - A present. Wow. Look at that. Well, I knew you wanted one. - Did you get a raise? - Yup. I'm proud of you, sweet pea. Where you going? Where you've been, Pepper? Um.. You know, I've been calling you. Yeah, I know, I, uh.. I, uh, I've been trying to get you your money. Yeah. Where is it? - Um... - Where is the money? I, uh, I can definitely get it to you by Friday.. My fucking ass is on the line, do you understand that? I'm fucking talking to you, Pepper. Let go of me. You fuckin'.. Carlos. - I can't breath. - Pepper. I fucking warned you, Pepper. - I'll get you the money. - When? Friday. I set up a profile and I got a good picture and everything, but.. So how was that guy the other night? I mean, he was okay. He had this weird fetishistic thing and he started to tie me up and then I was, like, you know what let's have some dinner first or at least a snack. Typical freaking male. He, like, was shaven down there and I thought that was pretty gross. - I love a clean shaved guy. - Really? How long you guys have been living here? Well, about three years but I'm saving up to buy my own place. She's been saying that for years. Hey, that coming from someone who's shoving their day's work up their nose. Now, give it to me. Look who's talking. Where was Pepper tonight? She didn't feel like working. She didn't wanna work because she's worried about running into what's-his-face from Vegas. Who? -That girl owes a lot of people money. Is she still, like, recruiting girls for the club? That's how she got me started. What do you mean recruiting girls? Nothing, just like, you know she gets a little commission or something but I don't know if she's still doing that. Isn't that how she brought you in? Come on, honey, you know you're not the only one who's been seduced by Pepper. Yeah, remember that time when we went with her to Reno? She gave us so many fucking drugs, I couldn't see straight for, like, what, three days after that. That girl is crazy. Oh, I mean, she is hauling ass. Dude, dude, I thought she was gonna bounce us right out of the back of that thing. Hey, my phone died. I was worried about you. What're you doing here? Do you recruit girls for the club? No. No. - Are you sure? - Who said that to you? - Have you ever? - No. I just don't know why they would say that. I... What? Wh-why they would say that? Did Diana say that? Huh? I'm just something that you're playing around with? Of course not. I think maybe you should get your stuff out. What? Are you fucking kidding me? I just don't know why they would say that. Yeah, because they're fucking doing lines of coke. Did you do coke? Did you fucking get high? No. No. They're a bunch of fucking cokeheads. Who do you think you are? Now that you're a fucking stripper you think you're some tough chick? Ha ha! Can't stop us! Get it. Yeah, yeah, she fucking came home for reunion. I saw her. Oh, yeah, I saw her and - - She got so fat. Yeah. I was like, she can't be pregnant 'cause she's buying tampons. Oh, my God. Danny. Remember Danny? - Yeah, yeah. - He lost all of his hair. - No. - Yeah. - Oh, that's kinda sad. - Yeah. - Are those new? - Hmm. Cute. Jenny and I were at Dairy Dream the other day and we were talking to the lady at the front counter and she said she hasn't seen you there. Yeah. Well, we probably haven't met each other yet. You know, just different shifts. Yeah. I thought you were there for a while now. - Bye, you love birds. - Bye. Later, y'all. Later, bro. -Hey, give me a call when you get back tonight. - Ah! - Easy there. That's why you don't wear them kind of shoes down in a quarry. What's going on? What do you mean? I know you got all these clothes and jewelry.. You have all this money all of a sudden you don't have any time to hang out. You're always too busy. Just a new pair of shoes and some earrings. You cheating on me? - Come on. - No? Then what is it? Where're you getting this money from? You're working at the Dairy Dream store? No. I'm not. Seriously? You had to keep that from me? I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you? What, I feel like a failure, okay? Come on, Sarah, I've told you, you could come work for me. Okay? Hey, I could give a shit less about that job. Fuck, you can come live with me if you want. I know. I know. - Okay, then why... - It's just.. What, you wanna live with your mom forever? No. I just feel like we need to talk because I.. I don't know, I, I feel like maybe we're going in different directions. Okay? Okay. Okay! Alright, get in the car. I'll, um, I'll drive you home. I'm not gonna leave you here, okay? - It's fine, I'll just walk. - Sarah, come on. Sarah! - I'll just walk home. - Sarah! No.-Sarah, get in the fucking car! Hey! Come on! Motherfucker! Goddammit! - Hi. - Hey. I, uh... I left some things in the shop. You didn't have a hard time getting in last time. Okay, so that thing at the club um, that was a big misunderstanding, you know. I don't do that. I haven't done it in ages. I.. I mean, I certainly didn't feel that you were gonna go and get a job there, you know? I.. I'm sorry. I.. I want you to trust me. So, uh, we can change the facade, right? There's no historical listing on the property? No. No. The previous owner's daughter had some emotional attachment to the place but... that's all. So we got a deal? Super Town Express coming soon. - I can see it. - Alright. Let's go back to my office and we'll work up the paperwork. Wake up. Wake up. - Mm-hmm. - Come on, wake up. Mmm. Mwah. Mwah. Mwah. Your face. Mwah. - They're gonna sell the store. - Hmm? They found a buyer. Yeah? What? Is that a bad thing? What are we doing here? There's nothing here for me. I wanna leave. What if we just got away? Now? And made up new names, a new story.. And all those things that we've talked about? And I could get a job. We could use the money that I saved up. We could do whatever we want. Come on. Isn't that great? Sarah, I'm in trouble, honey, you know? I owe.. I owe someone a lot of money.. And I can't keep running away. Okay. Well, how much? No, I don't, I don't wanna take your money. I don't wanna take your money. I don't wanna take your money. Look. I don't wanna take your money. Look. Look. Look at all of this. That's why I've saved this. Come on. It's enough? Yeah. I'll pay you back. I promise. It's for us. That's our freedom. That's a lot of money. Listen.. I want you to come with me.. Tonight... to Seattle, okay? Okay. I'll work.. One last shift tonight and then we can go. Uh, so we have a little bit extra money. - One last shift? - And you can pay that guy. And then we can go to, uh.. Africa maybe. Okay. - You know it's okay. - What? What? I feel like I could do anything with you. I feel like.. Anything is possible. I will take care of you, I promise. - You got the money? - Yeah, I got what you want. Let me have it. Come on, let me have it. What are you, fucking hyped up on coke?
