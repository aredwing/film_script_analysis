"the colorful city of 444 mosques." - Huh? - 444 mosques. You want to take me to them. You? Who needs you? Listen, I can go alone anytime I want to and... - Maybe not alone, you know? - All right! All right! I mean there's lots of interesting people one can meet while traveling. People interested in culture and things. Can I trouble you, Mr. Brennan? No trouble, but no smoking, it says there. We're going down. Oh, oh! Sure. Well, this is sort of like coming home for you, isn't it? Sort of like. Scandinavian Airlines System, Flight 100... from Karachi, Tehran, Damascus and Beirut, arriving at the gate five. Welcome to Istanbul. I am the guide. You're the guide? Istanbul is all right. - Excuse me. Mr. Brennan? - Right. Would you step this way, please? May I have my passport, please? Brennan. Thank you. Ah most welcome, Brennan. You are not exactly unexpected. Nice to be remembered. You have no idea what a pleasure it is to see you again. How often I have wondered about you. - May I? - Please. Five years is a long time to stay away. When one has a particular attachment. The war had something to do with that. Korea. James Brennan, Captain U.S. Air Force... Devastation Swan Cico power plant... Distinguished Service Cross. Honorable discharge. It's a very fine record, Brennan. I congratulate you. And now you've given up flying? No, except it's a little difficult without an airplane. The one I had got lost. Or would you remember that? Perfectly. Your papers, please. Thank you. And the purpose of your visit? Travel through here to Iran, on business. I heard the oil companies need pilots. You are passing through Istanbul on your way to Iran. Most interesting. Inspector, you're such a suspicious type. You know that's the kind of thing that breaks up old friendships. Oh, I hope not. But you know I must ask myself why you have come back. A sentimental journey perhaps? Pilgrimage to the scene of the former happiness? But that would only reopen an old wound. So I must feel that it is not sentiment that brought you back... But diamonds. I wish I could help you to find them... But I never did know what you were talking about... Thanks. It's been delightful chatting about old times. There reminds for me to hope that we all enjoy your stay in Istanbul. Thanks. And if there is anything that I can do for you at all, inspector... You'll be sure and let me know, won't you? I will be at the same hotel. Have a pleasant visit. - Mr. Brennan. - Kazim, good to see you. Good to see you. It has been a long time. Yep. I'd like my old room, eh? Ah yes, I remember. 424. I'm sorry, Mr. Brennan, your 424 has already been taken. An American couple, just arrived. That wouldn't be Mr. and Mrs. Boyle, would it? - Yes, you know them? - Mmm. If you wish, I will move you in when they check out. Good. In the meanwhile, I will put you next door, room 422. Take it up. Bonjour, monsieur. This way, please. Do you wish anything, sir? - Yeah, two vodka gimlets. - Two? Thanks for James Brennan. Thank you, Istanbul, thank you, beautiful night. And thank you, whatever you are called. That sounds just a little bit too much like goodbye. I didn't mean it. Really I didn't. What shall I say to remove the spell? Being In Turkish, it won't not work. - Turkish? - Yes. That sounds like wonderful magic. What does it mean? The truth comes from the heart not the tongue. I like that. Did you keep make it up? Of course. Know what we used to say in Munich... when we feel the way I do now? Tell me. I love you. When I fall in love it will be forever. Or I'll never. Falling in love with me. In a restless world like this love ends before starting many moonlight kisses. They look cool in the warmth of the sun. When I give my heart it will be completely. Or I'll never give. My Heart. And the moment I can fell that you feel that way too is when I fall in love. With you. And the moment I can fell that you feel that way too is when I fall in love. With you. Danny! You old spell-binder. If I could sing like that, man, I wouldn't do anything else. Come on. Sit down. Have a drink. No Thank you. Like the cop says "not when I'm on duty." That's a good boy. How is going with you, Miss Bauer? Thank you. Danny. What a lovely song. You've never sang it more beautifully. You should know. You've heard it every night for a solid week. But today was special. Let's say the way you heard it so special. Get him. One month in Turkey and he's already giving with the proverbs. What's with you? Flying dynamite to the island... Or fertilizer to Italy? I'll fly anything, anytime. You know me. However, I am temporarily retired. And I feel temporarily unnecessary. No, Danny, please. Please, nothing. I can't afford you two. - What? - Translation please. Every time I come over here and look into her love-laden eyes... I start moping about my girlfriend in New York. Do you know how much it cost to call New York from Turkey? I got to go up with the fellows who make the music. I'll see you later. - Nice guy. First class. - Mm-hmm. It's my ship, eh? Getting ready to sail. No regrets? It's going away. I don't want to go. Are you going home? Home is not the place where you were born... It's where you are happy. There she goes. Two weeks ago, I stood on her decks when she came in... wondering whether Istanbul would like me. Where were you two weeks ago? Flying in a load of machinery from England. Flying in. Flying out. You like that, do you? The Army taught me how. I haven't found anything I like to do better.. Besides, I've got my own plane. It's a lot nice, not getting shot at. Jim, did you say goodbye to a girl in England? A girl? Uh-hm. Safety of numbers, I always figured. The important thing though is that... Up till now there has never been a place I was sorry to leave. When I think of the vacations I have wasted elsewhere! Italy last year. And North Africa the year before. Don't think of yesterday. Today is the important thing. 3.30! And I've been here since half past 2. Where is he? When I finally find him, he's having lunch. He said he'd be right over. Hi, Florian. What's wrong? Ali said it was urgent. At 2:30, I came here to ask him to take a load of machinery to Cairo. It's already loaded in your plane. Now it's most important. Ali, that's all? I should break your neck, interrupting my lunch. But Jim, I thought I you wanted the business. You mean to say you're not interested? - No, sorry. - But it means a tidy sum. Yeah, I know but I'm not taking any jobs right now. My firm has given you a lot of business, Brennan. Sure, I'm appreciate that but I'm sticking around Istanbul awhile. Of course, if your social life means more to you than... working with Florian & Temple, we'll take our business elsewhere. Jim, darling, I... Oh... hi. Good afternoon. May I present Miss. Stephanie Bauer, Inspector Nural. - My pleasure, Miss. Bauer. - How do you do? - Everything legal, inspector? - Perfectly. I await the day when you succumb to temptation. Aw, darling. The inspector is what you might call a customs cop. He awaits the day when he figures I'll come in loaded with contraband. I do not think Mr. Florian expected you to turn him down. - Are you going out of business? - No but ah... we have so much to do here in Istanbul. It is a pleasure to have met the lady who keeps Jim Brennan... from making what I believe is called a "fast buck." - Good day, Miss Bauer. - So long, Inspector. Come on, darling. Let's finish lunch. Mr. Florian was very angry. Yeah. Hot temper. The trip to Cairo would only take two or three days. I'd still be here when you get back. You must be practical. Practical? I hate that word, even from you. When you come back, I'll have found a place to live and a job. Okay. I'll try to break all the records and make it back in two days. That would be very nice. Why we stop here? I'll see Aziz for a moment. See you tomorrow. Give these cigarettes to Inspector Nural. Tell him I smuggled them in. Aziz! Yes. Ah Jim! A most pleasant surprise! It's good to see you too. - Am I interrupting something? - No no, I'm quite alone. But tell me/ Where have you been? How is your life? My life? Never better. I've been flying around Africa, Europe... Made a few bucks here. Lost a few there. And I found a girl. A girl? You must tell me about you I want to get something special for her because she is a very special person. And I... What's the matter? A problem? No, nothing at all. Whatever you give her will be highly special. I assure you. Let's see. - I think... - No, nothing of that sort. Must be a gift to make a memory. Great. Jim... Look, if I should need a favor... Sure, anything you say. Well .. What is the trouble? Please do not ask me now. But if tomorrow or next week... I should need your help... You know where I am. Same hotel. Glad to give it. Thank you. But we have forgotten your lady. - And I know just the thing. - Good. - Zowie! - It pleases you? Sure, but this is out of my range. It's my gift to you and to your lady. Oh no. This thing must be worth a fortune. Very well then. You may buy it. The price is 50 American dollars. You're lying in your teeth. You can refuse my gifts but don't tell me my business. No point in arguing with you. You know your business. I wish you and your lady happiness. Thanks. Oh and about that favor? Yes, Jim, are you going to stay here for awhile? You bet your life I am. Then perhaps you'll hear from me in a few days. Go ahead. Take care of yourself. Aziz? Yes, Mr. Brennan? Oh my. Later. Or I'll never fall in love. In a restless world like this is. Love is ended before it begins. I wish it could just go on like this. His eyes are sad, aren't they? Seems to be looking outward at a great distance... Wondering what's ahead for him. I used to do that. After my father and mother died... I used to go for miles out of my way to avoid the house where they were caught in the bombing. You had friends. For God's sake, I don't know which is sadder. When I met you, it seemed like an endless wait. Does he understands what we are saying? - Who? - Him. Don't know if he understands the language... But 10 to 1, he gets the idea. - Honey? - Yes? Will you marry me? Jim. What a question! You're serious! "Will you marry me?" You know I will, darling. Yes. You're going to have to leave without me. Too many long nights alone. Not even a date. So I got a little too lonely, And now you're a little too late. You never would write. You never would call. While I had the blues, you were havin' a ball. You thought that I'd be here to run to I'm gonna do to you what I've been done to. Too bad about you, my friend, It could've been great. But I was a little too lonely. And now you're a little too late. Say, that was okay, fellas. We'll put that in tonight. And be on time for a change. Hi, fellas. What's your problem? They want me to do a benefit in Anchora this Sunday. And I thought if you happened to be flying that way, I could hitchhike. Oh gee, there's nothing I'd like better, Danny. But if did that, I'd be missing my own honeymoon. - You and Miss Bauer? - This afternoon. Well, congratulations, Jim. Real good luck and everything. Well, if you have a bride, what are you standing around here for? What for? Give her my best. Long distance, please. New York. I still say there should be a law... that once you decide to be married, you are married. I should have known that after filing there's a three weeks delay. I have a little gift for you. - Your engagement present. - There's someone out there. Look what I found. Please don't tear my shirt. The material is irreplaceable. Oh I beg your pardon. Your balcony has a truly amazing view. Yes. Be sure and drop in anytime. Now let's talk about you. You see before you Paul Renkov. A miserable thief. Most unskillful. I'm always caught. I have nothing to hide. - Who sent you here? - Who would send me? Only a fool would employ a man like me. Oh those are lovely cufflinks. - Hmm. What do you want? - The diamonds. Why shouldn't we do business? You and I? If you have diamonds, I have contacts to dispose of them. Nobody else involved. So you beat me up, Mr. Brennan. What do I care? I'm always beaten up. - But you won't kill me. - Don't be so sure. But just in case something stuck to your fingers. Come on. Let's have a look. Now let me show you something. You see that door? If you ever come through it again, I'll ram it right down your throat. - Do you believe me? - Oh yes. Completely. I do. Why didn't you call the police? Oh darling, they don't have time to waste on a petty thief. Jimmy spoke of diamonds. Why does he come to you? Haven't you heard? Americans are fantastically rich. And there's proof of it. Here's your engagement present. Like it? More than anything in my whole life. Just something I stole from an old friend. - Oh we have to invite him to the wedding? - Mm-hm. Forgive me. - What's your problem?- - Have you got a cigarette, please? Sure. Gently. Gently. Okay. Gently. What do you want? Could you not hazard a guess, sir? My wallet's in my coat. Pretty good going over. 10 or 12 bucks. You take me for thief then? You'll do. Till one comes along. Where are they, sir? You tell me what, I'll tell you where. - The diamonds. - What diamonds? White, brilliant and most valuable. Sorry, I'm fresh out. I want those stones, sir. I haven't got any. You saw your friend Aziz the other afternoon. Sure I saw him. He gave them to you then. Very well, Mr. Brennan. Until next time. Now you told Officer Sarac here you spent the entire evening... - With Miss. Bauer. - Correct. The men that beat you up, Have you never seen any of them before? - Nope. - And how do you account for it? If I ever meet them again, I'll make a point to inquire. And when was the last time you saw your friend Aziz Rachim? Aziz? He's got nothing to do with it. Since we are all so mystified, how can we be sure? As a matter of fact, you saw him just a few days ago. - Then why ask? - Policeman's habit. Rachim has disappeared, Mr. Brennan. Not only from his shop and apartment. We've searched the city. Impossible. Not impossible, Mr. Brennan. Merely an arresting coincidence. I must tell you another? One day you're low in funds. The next, you plan to marry this charming lady. I do not think that you would undertake such a step if you were to remain a poor man. At the same time, we are informed that $200,000 worth of stolen diamonds... have been stuck smuggled into Istanbul from Cairo. In such a bracelet as yours, Miss. Bauer. It is yours, for the moment. It would be a pity to lock it up in a vault.. Wouldn't it? It is very beautiful. Well, if we can't help you any further, can we leave now? Very well unless Officer Sarac has further questions. One moment, please. Yes? Thank you. This will interest you. The merchant Rachim has been found. He was discovered in the harbor area, dead of knife wounds. You're free go. You were wonderful. Perfect. How did it happen? Why did those men beat you up, Jim? I think I have a line on some diamonds. - You haven't? - I didn't steal them. - I know you didn't but... - Trust me. Tell me something. How would you like to be married in Paris? I think Paris would be very suitable. In go upstairs and pack. Fast. All right. Jim, the diamonds. You're going to give them back, aren't you? Back? Back to whom? Aziz Or the thugs who killed him? The police? The police? The police didn't take a beating for them. I did. Those diamonds only belong to the man who's got them. Now go on. Get ready for that $200,000 honeymoon. I see you in an hour. Jim! Good day, Miss Bauer. Hello. That's okay, Mac., I live here. Come in. Brennan, come in. You must forgive us. Another hour and all would've been as it was. Oh that's all right. Coming back to an empty room wouldn't be the same. Now if you'll get your bloodhounds out of here I'd like to start packing. - You're leaving us? - Yes. With deep regret. But why the sudden decision? Miss Bauer and I are flying to Paris. We're going to be married. We didn't want to wake up and find you underneath the bed. You'll permit me. Personal search. Of course. Feel free. You still looking for those diamonds or what? A policeman's preoccupation. Still refuse to help us, eh? Eh what if I could? If you know the whereabouts of the diamonds... - Turkish authorities... - Could get off the hook, eh? What about Aziz? I'm sorry. That is not my department. And diamonds aren't my department. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to leave. Oh I don't mind. In fact, I insist. You are to be deported from Turkey, Mr. Brennan. Deported? On what grounds? You're an undesirable alien. Under suspicion by the police and the custom authorities. Leave me. I can have your visa revoked and put you on a Paris plane Within an hour. - I'll fly my own plane. - That won't be possible, I'm afraid. Pending the clarification of certain technicalities, your aircraft has been impounded. I see. Well, that would be a good deal, presuming I had the diamonds. Those diamonds will never leave Turkey, Mr. Brennan. Till the time of boarding the plane, you will be in my custody. You will allow me? Certainly. Make a reservation for Miss. Bauer. SAS, flight reservations, please. What is the problem? There's a fire in the Lido apartments. - Lido. Stephanie. - Hold it. Miss Bauer. Did you see Miss Bauer? Miss. Bauer, have you seen her? I saw her. - Where she is? Where'd she go? - No one came out of the building. Brennan! Brennan, come here! Brennan! Brennan! Stephanie! Stephanie! No years. She's beyond recognition. The fire seems to have started in that part of the the building. It's very old. What can I say? Nothing. Mr. Brennan? Mr. Brennan? It's pleasant to see you again. Is it? I've already been here 2 min. What kept you? It's nice that you haven't forgotten Paul Renkov. May I buy you a drink? Oh no, save your money. You're the kind who will die broke. Thank you. You know, Mr. Brennan, I'm badly paid. I make up for it with treachery. You wouldn't care to buy a little information? Like what? Like the name of my employer. Un-uh. No deal. It's a pity. His name is Darius. It is an old acquaintance of yours. You met him once... in an alley. He would like to see you. No really. He would.. - I wonder what we would talk about. - I rather suspect diamonds. I might enjoy that. This time, I can promise you a most civilized meeting. Good. Don't count on it. How good of you to come, Mr. Brennan. Yes, of course you do remember me. Like yesterday. Naturally you have certain ideas of violence and revenge. I assure you they would be quite ridiculous, given the circumstances. Paul, you may leave us. Fascinating room, isn't it, Mr. Brennan? One can retire from the world of business... To the world of beauty. I was at one time in the importing line, you know. Yes. Aziz Rachim said you were in business together. No, Mr. Brennan. A bad shot in the dark. Five years ago, in line with certain of my activities... I had the opportunity of buying in Cairo $200,000 worth of the most beautiful diamonds. I paid somewhat less for them of course. I had been smuggled into Istanbul. Is not it beautiful? Am I boring you, Mr. Brennan? No no, sad stories are my favorite. A foolish bookkeeper of mine stole the diamonds and sold them to Rachim Aziz. A few days later, Aziz learned that my bookkeeper... met with a fatal accident. He made arrangements to leave the country. - He didn't make it, did he? - No. Unfortunately not. And I never recovered my property. Mr. Brennan. This loss was a source of considerable unhappiness for me. It's one of the saddest story I've ever heard. Mr. Brennan, I feel those diamonds are still in Istanbul. I call upon you to find them for me. You will be handsomely paid. - Like how much? - Like $10,000. No. Couldn't close the deal for that. I feel you owe it to yourself to try, sir. I don't think our friend Aziz would approve. - Got a cigarette? - Of course. Do forgive me. Just like old times, eh, professor? In the back alleys. You're pretty good talker. Now let's talk more about Aziz. No! Paul, you will take Mr. Brennan back to his hotel. As you say, sir. It will now be the technique of the old days. There's a kid you've got here, professor. Get him to tell you sometime how he tried to make his own deal for the diamonds. Look Marge, I said no and that's final. I don't care what we spent for the tickets. Stop being a stubborn ox. We are not going to see no Hamlet. Especially in Turkish. No need to raise your voice, Charles. Come off it with that Charles routine. You're not that far from Brooklyn, Marge O'Hare. You never will be. It's times like this, I know my mother was right. You are a slob. Having fun? Mr. Brennan, how nice to see you. It's a pleasure to see you. Especially wearing that beautiful gown. - What is it, Becker, Dior? - Balenciaga. You see Charles, there are man who can tell a Paris gown from a diving suit. Diving suit! Have a drank, Brennan. Thanks, very much. - Big evening planned? - No. Not really. We thought we might go to the theater. They're showing Hamlet, you know. In Turkish. Now, I think we're going to skip that for the night, Marge. Oh, that would be a shame. That would be some experience, Hamlet in Turkish. Oh, we won't skip it. Mme Boyle, what a surprise! How wonderful to find you here. Monsieur Moret! Charles, you remember Monsieur Moret! - Sure. - This is the M. Brennan. "Monsieur." May I have the pleasure of dancing with you? - Huh? - Dance. Oh. Oui. Oui-oui. If Monsieur not does not mind. Oh, he doesn't. If you'll excuse us. French business man we met coming over. Couldn't take his eyes off Marge. - Can't blame him. - Waiter! Whiskey. You can't tell me about Moret? Is he... how can I tell you what his business is? Huh? What do you mean? He is what you might call a... Professional international charmers. You know that type. Great guy with the girls. If he tries to get cozy with Marge... No no. He's not that obvious. But when it comes to that smooth technique, oh.. He's the guy that wrote the book. But I'll say that for him, if your wife likes culture... Moret's certainly got it. Wait till I get her home. I'll break her cultured arm. If you're gonna catch that show, it's just about curtain time. You're right. Sorry to bust in. But we've got a show to catch. Remember, honey? Look, dear. If you don't want to go, it's perfectly all right. Don't want to go? Me? What, are you kidding? Sorry, Moret. See you, Brennan. Charlie, this is ridiculous. You are hurting me. Nice meeting you. The Boyles have just left the hotel, sir. All right. Wait a minute. Thank you very much. It was a beautiful evening. - Thank you. - Sure. Good night. It's been lovely. - Goodbye, Vera. - Good night. Stephanie. I am afraid you have made a mistake I'm Jim. Jim. Jim Brennan. Sorry... Mr. Brennan, I think you have confused my wife with somebody else. Her name is Karen, Karen Fielding . - I beg your pardon. - That's all right. Good night. Yes, Mr. Brennan? A couple who just left. Fielding is the name I think. Do you know them? Mr. and Mrs. Fielding. Oh yes. He is a construction engineer from London. The consul here can tell you more about him. All right. He knows me, dear. He knows me. He could have been wrong. A mistake is not impossible. He called me Stephanie. Stephanie and says he knows me. Mere suggestion he said. His name, Brennan it means something to you? We knew this might happen one day. - Look at me. Are you happy? - You know who I am. Do I? I think I know what it must be like. Always wondering, groping, searching for memories... That are never there. And then I think of you and all I am... And all you have given me and the past doesn't matter. It could you know. We have a very perfect life together, you and I, Karen. You open the past now, it can shatter. It's for you to decide, darling. Question mark for the past... Or one for the future. Your choice. I can plead my own case quite simply. - I love you very much. - Douglas. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Is Mr. Fielding in, please? - Are you expected, sir? I'm an old friend. The name is Brennan. - Would you mind waiting here, sir? - No. Oh... Mr. and Mrs. Fielding live here long? No, sir. Mr Fielding only uses this house during his visits in England. Thank you. Yes, Mr. Brennan? Mr. Brennan? Me? Stephie? What is this? What happened? Last night, after five years... The woman you saw last night is not the woman you knew. You mean to tell me that you're not Stephanie Bauer? Perhaps I'm not. 5 years ago, I lost my memory... As a result of what the doctors call shock... I was found wandering the streets by the man... Who is now my husband. My life began with Douglas Fielding and... I'm quite content with that life. What I was before has no meaning to me. Stephie. Listen to me the day you disappeared in that fire... Were going to fly to Paris... Please, I have no intention of hearing. I'm telling you the truth! I'm not interested in my past! Nor in you, Mr. Brennan. Sorry if I hurt you. But there seems to be no other way to make you understand. Now if you'll please excuse me. Mr. Brennan, I'm sorry. They didn't tell me you were here. - Have you seen my wife? - Yes. - Cigarette? - No thanks. Tell me, Brennan. How well did you know Karen? - I was in love with her. - And she with you? - Yes. - I see. And now you find her well and happy in a home and life where she's loved. And I may add, terribly needed. You intend to change all that? I don't intend to let her spend the rest of her life in a state of amnesia. For whose sake then? Hers or yours? Brennan, I ask you what could you do that wouldn't be selfish and cruel? I assure you Karen is happy. Happy? How can she be happy when she can't remember the greater part of her life? Perhaps the best part. What kind of happiness is this? Let her know the truth. Then we will know where we stand. My wife isn't a trophy in a contest between you and me, Brennan! I do not care where we stand. Well, I do. I think she ought to decide which part of her life she wants to remember. And which part she's going to forget. We're leaving for England tonight. - Is there anything else? - No, not for the moment. Very well. I think you better you go. Mr. Fielding has called, madam. He says he will pick up the plane tickets on his return. Thank you, Bruno. Those are packed. You can take them down. - James. - Yes, madam? You called? No. Tell Mr. Fielding I had to go out. I shan't be very long. Yes, madam. This way, madam. This way. Do you mind if I sit over there? Not at all. Excuse me. - Madame? - Yes. Vodka gimlet, please. Very well. Mr. Brennan, I did not expect you so soon. Won't you sit down? Thank you. - For you. Monsieur? - Nothing right now. Thanks. I see you still favor vodka gimlets. Still? Okay, let's not start that again. - You wanted to see me? - Yes. The day Douglas found me, I was holding this in my hand. Your visit this morning made me think of it. I thought you might know why. Simple. I gave it to you. Why? Because I was very much in love with you. We were to be married. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here. No. Please. Don't go. Maybe I was just feeling a little sorry for myself. Why did you really come here? I came because I am a coward. I think one must be very brave to want something desperately. And to turn one back on it. Earlier today, I tried to be very strong. And send away my only hope of recovering the past. But I am not strong enough. I don't know what I mean to you. But you mustn't make a mistake. Whatever you're going to tell me it won't change my life with my husband. Your name is Stephanie Bauer. Your home was in Munich. You were a dress designer. You lived alone. Your parents were killed in the war. These things. Are you sure? You came through here on a cruise. 1951. We met. You were supposed to go home but you didn't. You stayed here. - Don't you remember anything? - No nothing. You must remember that bracelet. I gave it to you. It meant a lot to you. And this place here. This table. Why did you choose this particular table? I will tell you why. We sat here together. Often. I'm sorry. My husband will be waiting. We are leaving tonight. Goodbye, Mr. Brennan. Come in. It's Charlie! Hey, honey, he's here! I just want to say goodbye. Well, leaving? Yeah, me and old dollface are moving out in the morning. Six o'clock plane to Paris. It's been delightful making your acquaintance, Mr. Brennan. Indeed it has. Especially for me. Don't you get a kick out of those sunglasses? You know. Come on, Charlie. We'll be late. Well if I don't see you again... You will. We're leaving on the same plane. We are? Well. Maybe you can show me Paris if Charlie. - Is not busy... - Come on, Sweetheart. Good night, Brennan. Is Mr. Brennan in? - Yes, inspector. Should I announce? - No no no. It's a surprise visit. His room is 422, isn't it? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Brennan. Why, Brennan. Hi. I thought I missed you. Yeah? No, I was just saying goodbye to some friends. Really? May I ask whom? Sure. Mr. And Mrs. Boyle. Delightful people. Americans, of course. How about a drink? Pity your friends weren't here to receive your farewell. - May I ask when they are leaving? - Sure. Tomorrow. You'd have liked her. Delightful person. Yes. I'm sure I would. - Shall we go to your room? - Yeah. - Drink? - No thanks. Not when I'm working. That's a good boy. I see you also plan to leave Istanbul. Yep. In the morning. Big diamond search is still on? Go ahead. Help yourself. I really came to ask about Mrs. Fielding. I'm getting a little tired of discussing my personal affairs. - With the Turkish police. - Customs department. Ah, Customs. Saw her in the hotel bar this afternoon. You'd be surprised how legal it was. - You tell her about your past? - Tried to. - How'd she take it? - She didn't. Nothing registered. You know one day I'm going to pack a bag without you getting your nose in it. - Tell me. When she left? - 4 hours ago. Do you mind? Was she upset when she left here? She was trying to catch up with the past. She went home to her husband. How do you expect she'd feel? Brennan. Mrs. Fielding never returned home. She disappeared. - That was over four hours ago. - Yes. How did she leave here? What I know? In a taxi, I guess. I don't know. Oh, if she should try to reach you - let me know. - Sure sure. Yeah, anything. I'll be at police headquarters. With Sarac. Goodbye. Operator. Did you just ring here? Yes. It was a man talking, wasn't it? Thanks. - Who is it? - Telegram, Mr. Brennan. Okay. Bring it in. Thanks. What's this? The idea? - Mr. Darius would like to see you. - Darius? - I can't say it's exactly mutual. - Stay where you are. You shouldn't be so careless. - Look, I'm warning you. - You're not warning me now. Go ahead. Go on. The woman? Is she in the building? Is she in the building? You don't speak English, eh? So, Mr. Brennan. You have the game as you desired. So long as you're calling the ground rules, why don't you get rid of this pleasure date? He makes me bashful. You know of course that we have Mrs. Fielding. That might upset Mr. Fielding. But I don't see how it will buy any diamonds. I put it to you, sir. That you are still very much in love with the woman you presumed to be dead. That you'll be happy to make an exchange. The diamonds in return for Mrs. Fielding's release. Alive and well. The same way you released Aziz? Aziz was a very stubborn man, sir. As far as I'm concerned, Mrs. Fielding might be home right now with her husband. I never bluff, Mr. Brennan. One is so indefensible when it is called. After you, sir. What are they doing? What do they want? Okay, boys. You got her. What next? I wonder how much you really value those stones. I haven't gotten those diamonds. But she has. That is not only ungallant, sir. But a lie. Do you think I'd still be hanging around Istanbul if I could lay my hands on them? Sure. I came here to get them. But she got them.. - Didn't you? - No. But you didn't even know that she was still alive? I saw her picture in a London newspaper... I traced her here. Came back here to get those diamonds. And she got them. Didn't she? I came with my husband. Do not know about any diamonds. I can't remember. A very convenient case of amnesia. You offered me a deal. 10,000 bucks to find them. - Still hold? - Still holds. - Where are they, Stephanie? - I do not know. - Where are they? - I don't know. I gave them to you, The day before the fire. No. I can't remember. You were going to smuggle them out of Turkey. And meet me in Paris. I can't. I don't know. Stephanie. Where are they? Paul. Perhaps you can persuade Mrs. Fielding. Come on. I find no physical damage. The effects of fear on the human mind are difficult to gauge. Let her rest, Mrs. Fielding. Now we can do no more. Thank you, Doctor. I'll come by again in the morning. Gentlemen. Brennan, I owe you an apology. Save it. I've got a six o'clock plane to catch. That is, with the inspector's permission. Do you mind if I use your phone? When she comes out of it, just tell her, goodbye. She's got nothing to regret. Brennan. Help me. Pleas I don't know. Jim. Wait for me! Jim, I'm burning. I can't! I can't! Karen, you're all right. My darling, you're safe now. Karen. My darling, can you hear me? - Make it go away. - Karen. Please make it go away. It's all over now, Karen. It's all over. - Douglas. - Karen. You should be resting. Too much to think about. Remembering... Having it also clear again. In the car the first night we met Jim. Do you remember what you said? Very well. I said you had a choice to make. Come sit down. I've made my choice. We go back to England together. I'll be well again. And I'll make you happy more than before. Now that you've decided, would you mind telling me why? I'm your wife and I want our marriage. You're my wife. And I'm sure you care for me. I'm very grateful. You feel drawn to me by every motion except love. That's reserved for Jim Brennan. My life is with you, Douglas. I wonder how grateful you'd be if I told you I've known who you. Who you were the first month. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to lose you. I knew about Jim Brennan too. What happened to me was not your fault. Remember that young psychiatrist who examined you in London? I think his name was Evans. He was under the impression he could cure you. I sent him away. Now what do you say? I say, you're still my dearest friend, whatever you have done. I will try to prove it to you. Flight to Paris, Vienna... That's our flight. Through to Paris. - Thank you. - Thank you. - You are Mr. Boyle? - That's right. Is this your complete baggage? It better be. But the way she packs. A slight formality, monsieur. Your baggage will be returned shortly. - A mere technicality. - If you will accompany us please. - Now wait a minute. - That's your trouble, Charlie... Never understand technicalities. Technicalities? You don't even know what technicalities is! Yes. Very shortly. Goodbye. Please accept my apologies. I have to examine your luggage. May I have your keys, please? - But why me? - Because you're such a big shot. Oh, so they're bothering you too? No no. The inspector never bothers me. We've got a deal. I would want my friends to miss their plane. - Let me handle it. - Just so we get out of here. Man I have your keys? Would you mind telling me what this is all about? It's about $200,000 worth of trouble. But I think we can take care of it. Thank you, Mr. Brennan. You see I told you. "'You should have listened to your mother." Inspector, you're a success. Is that a confession or a declaration? That's up to you. Final call. ASA Flight 852. All passengers please on board. - Your plane? - That's still up to you. And Mr. and Ms. Boyle are free to go. We're almost at the airport. Well. You're pretty good cop. Oh yes. It's a pity you will not be here to read my report. You're quite a character. So long, Brennan. Good flight. So long, Nural. Fasten your seat belts, please. Please fasten your seatbelts. No reason to be nervous, ladies and gentlemen we've been ordered back. Please fasten your seatbelts, again.
