You can leave this place. But isn't everyone coming with me? It's no use. We can't leave here. Don't worry about us. Hurry up and leave. No, I don't want to. I don't want to be separated from everyone. No. You have to go alone. Oneechan! Farewell, Ai. It looks as though one has got away. What a pain in the ass! Goura, go get her back! There's a foul stench in the air. You're awake. Are you alright? Yes. Sango Hang on tight, okay? Kirara, get us out of here. What's that? It's coming this way! Kagome-sama! Miroku-sama, Sango-san! Kagome-sama, help me with the child please! Got it. Shippou, you heard him. Okay! Please take care of her. Leave it to me. Sango. We're off. Everything's okay now. Good Lord, he's enormous! Inuyasha!! Inuyasha-niichan. Don't underestimate me! Inuyasha Fire on the Mystic Island A turtle!? Over here, ya'bloody turtle! Inuyasha! Inuyasha-niichan! Crap! Hiraikotsu! I can't hold it any longer! Kagome-chan! Kagome-sama! If only I'd held it together. Kagome! What the hell are you doing? But!! Hey! Why didn't you save me too? Stupid mutt! You weren't abandoned or anything! I was so scared! Everything's okay now, or so I'd like to say. However it doesn't look like we're out of the woods yet. It looks that way. What are we going to do? Ah, nothing soothes my tense nerves like the feel of your... What the hell do you think you're doing at a time like this? Sorry. Housi-sama! Miroku! Transform! You saved me. You're an albatross, right? I'm a hawk! Kaza-ana! It's no good, Miroku. You're just sucking up sea water! Houshi-sama! Miroku, Sango, get outta the way! KAZE NO KIZU! Heh, nothing to it. It's not over yet, Inuyasha. What did you say? Dammit! He's tougher than I thought. What an incredibly hard body. He's got to have a weak point. Listen up Inuyasha, try it again. Uh... ok. Go!!! Eat this! KAZE NO KIZU! It appears that Goura has been defeated. That fucker! My cute little brother! His name was Inuyasha something or other... That hanyou! What should we do, Ryuura-ani? This time..... We won't let him escape from the island. Hey! Inuyasha! Kagome! You guys all okay? Say Inuyasha, who's that kid over there? Huh? Oh yeah. I was surprised when I first saw her. Inuyasha-niichan! Particularly since it's been about 50 years since I first met her. Niichan! Huh? This child.... Ah, that child! That's a hanyou alright. So it seems. Gah, don't just suddenly glomp onto me like that! Inuyasha-niichan Please, I beg you. Save everyone! Huh? Here you go, Ai-chan. It's yummy! Thank you! So, where did you say you ran away from? Houraijima. It's an island beyond this ocean. There was an island back there? Well, there was a lot of fog. Houraijima is a legendary island. It only appears along with the fog once every few decades or so. This was all before Kikkyou had sealed me. Which way is the bloody shore? Damn it! With fog like this, there's nothing we can do. Impatience won't change anything. Uh... yeah, I guess. What's that? An island?! What the? There we saw a bunch of hanyou brats just like that squirt. According to what they told us... the island had been ruled by some youkai known as The Four War Gods. It sounded like the kids had always been under their control. Whaddaya want, twerps? Wait Inuyasha. Inuyasha, let's listen to their story. What? Gah, what a pain in the ass! Get out of here you guys! Kikkyou! Inuyasha! Sankoutessou! This guy! He's sucking my blood! Kikkyou! Who the hell's there? You friggin' hanyou... don't even try to fight me! Inuyasha! Are you alright? . One day we Four War Gods will claim your life. Inuyasha! Did he run away? Are you okay, Kikkyou? Yes, but I was careless. Inuyasha, the island is... What the? There was nothing we could do. It disappeared. We returned to the village. Later I heard from Kikkyou, that it was the legendary 'Houraijima, that people talk of. I've heard at one time the Emperor of China in hopes of finding the "fountain of youth'', had searched for Houraijima. So that's why Ai hasn't changed in these 50 years, right? ...Oniichan, Oniichan... Inuyasha! What's wrong? Nothing. Is you back injured? Here, show me. Shut-up! I told you it was 'nothing!' It's not 'nothing!' Let me see it! Come on now, using such loud voices is going to wake up Ai! It's not 'nothing!' Let me see it! Come on now, using such loud voices is going to wake up Ai! Come on now, using such loud voices is going to wake up Ai! Lay off, will ya'! Come on now, using such loud voices is going to wake up Ai! Osuwari! Oh brother. So is this it? The Crimson Scar of The Four War Gods? Bloody traitors, I won't forget this! I thought the wind smelled. I knew it. That's Houraijima, isn't it? What is it, you guys? Weren't you asleep? Well Inuyasha, what are you going to do? Will you save the children? Hmph, like hell I will! However, I plan to thoroughly pay back the debt for these marks on my back. Then it's settled. It's an island! You can see an island. Where? Where? Whoa. That's...... Fifty years ago, it appeared along with demons. It's a demon NEST. It's truly a frightening affair. I recall fifty years ago when that cursed island appeared. Many villagers were killed by the numerous demons that came and attacked us. The demons didn't even spare the women or children. No matter where we ran, it didn't matter. There was no escaping them. Thank you for the tea. Miko-sama, where are you going? To put an end to this. Huh? (chanting) Ugh, the salty air on my throat... Sesshoumaru-sama, if we keep going this way, we'll come out at the ocean... ...uh... He's not listening to me at all! Jaken-sama, as long as Sesshoumaru-sama is with us, there's nothing to worry about. Ah shaddup! I didn't ask for you to console me! Like I need to listen to someone like you! The one who knows Sesshoumaru-sama the best is... ouch! Oh please forgive me, Sesshoumaru-sama. Due to Rin's worthless blabbing, I have blundered and must.... So, it has appeared. What's appeared? Sesshoumaru-sama! We can see it now. So that's Houraijima. What is this feeling? There's something sinister about that island. Don't let your guard down. They've come. They've come. How nice of them to bring back the hanyou child too. We really must be grateful. Jyuura... how about a "warm-up.'' Sounds good. Then, brother I shall go to the temple. Please save us! Oh please spare us! I am Kyoura of The Four War Gods. This place will become a holy battleground. Therefore, you people are in the way. HAKU JYUTSU JYUU! You've come. I've been waiting a long time for this moment, Sesshoumaru-sama. Eat this! What's that? Take this! And this! Kirara, get us up higher! I won't let you run away! We can't approach him carelessly, can we? We'll have to separate from everyone. Are you guys ok? Hey, it's been a while! You guys, I knew it. I was aware you had returned here. This time there won't be any escape. Then we'll take the best damn welcome party ever! Nice swo you've got there. For a mutt like you, what a waste! However, it is no match for my hujinga and raijinga swords. Inuyasha! Don't worry. Get away from here. KAZE NO KIZU! CHI RYOU HUIN! What the? Dont look so amazed by that, yet. Don't get carried away yet! TEN RYOU SHIN RAI!! Inuyasha!!! Whew, close one. A spirit arrow? And here's one more coming your way. Back down, Kagome! This guy is mine. Wait, you jackass! Are you running away? Fighting the likes of you is more boring than I thought. I thought you were a little stronger than that. Stop spouting your mouth off! Get back here! Shit! Inuyasha! Are you okay, Inuyasha? Inuyasha? Kagome-chan! Oh good, you two are alright! Yes, we somehow managed to shake him off, however these guys are a handful. Kujyuukusun How was that? Just what I'd expect from you, Sesshoumaru-sama.. SYOU RYUU HA! Nicely done. Let us next meet at Houraijima. I don't think so. You don't actually have a say in the matter. That is, as long as you bear the Crimson Scar of The Four War Gods. Sesshoumaru-sama! Oh, that was so close! To lose him right at the last second! Uh.not that there is any disgrace in that, Sesshoumaru-sama Oh, I get it. You let him go on purpose just to postpone the fun. Sesshoumaru-sama. Sesshoumaru-sama. Formerly I was a humble servant to your father. My name is Kujaku. And I am Seiten. My father is dead. Yes, we are aware. Then get lost. Please wait. We are heading to Houraijima to exterminate The Four War Gods. This was the will of your father. Not interested. Sesshoumaru-sama! Sesshoumaru-sama! How dare you! If Sesshoumaru-sama were here..... Hmpf, he's all talk. I shall receive these prizes. Ah, there was one more left? I suppose that means you are Sesshoumaru-sama. Sesshoumaru? You fool. You call yourself a god? Indeed I do. I will skin you alive. Father, what were you thinking? A weak opponent like that... Now I see. You are strong. However, you'd best not underestimate the power of a god. You cannot escape me. Er....um....Sesshoumaru-sama? So are we heading to fiinish off the one who got away after all? It's not necessary. Yeah, YEAH, you're right. Hey Rin, don't just blab nonsense like that! But I didn't say anything! There's no way this can be allowed to continue. This way! It's Ai! Ai has come home! She's with Inuyasha! He's returned! Wow! I've never seen this many fiireflies! Fireflies are beautiful but their existence is so fleeting. chichi wa iwareta arakasi no te wa mamori no te Father once told me "The youkai are the hand that protects." haha wa iwareta hito no te aru wa hagukumi no tame Mother once told me " The humans are the hand that nurtures" ryou te awase tobira wo hiraki When both hands are joined, the door will open guren no naka ni nare wo kaesu From inside the crimson flames, thou are returned. na ga kora wo hikari to narite mamorikamae We, the children, are the light, that defends..... mamorikamae That defends. Neechan! Oneechan! Oniichan! Ai Ai Oneechan! You idiot! Why did you come back? But! D'on't blame the shrimp. Inuyasha-san! I came to gather up The Four War Gods and beat them into a pulp for you. He says he's gonna beat The Four War Gods to a pulp, Roku I remember some wuss 50 years ago who said he would beat them to a pulp but ran away instead. Huh Dai? OUCH! Remember this well you two: Inuyasha is a narrow-minded prick. He doesn't even take it easy on kids. Shaddup! He doesn't even take it easy on kids. Shion, why are you hiding? I'll be gone soon. Get a hold of yourself and be a man! But Oneechan, what if.... Inuyasha-san, please take Ai with you and leave this island! She's the only one who hasn't received the Crimson Scar and can still leave. This Crimson Scar, do you mean.... This. As long as we have the scar, we cannot leave the island. It's just like Moegi says. Then that's means I can't leave either, doesn't it? Inuyasha has the same scar on his back. What a joke! He didn't come to save us, he was pulled in by the scar! What a moron! Then, will you take Ai away from here? Why don't you tell us a bit about your story, um....? She's Asagi-neechan. Asagi-chan. It looks as though there's a barrier up around this island. In addition, these kids cannot escape. In that case, Inuyasha, first you should go destroy the source of the barrier. It won't do any good. But if it's Inuyasha oniichan... Silence. If we do something to anger The Four War Gods not even you guys will be spared. Asagi-neechan! The Meidou no Kama is calling. The Meidou no Kama? I have to go now. "Go?" Where are you going? It has nothing to do with you. Please just leave us alone. You idiot! Stop acting all high and mighty when you're just a dumb brat. Inuyasha OSUWARI! What do you think you're doing. She's a girl! Whoa, she's strong! Asagi-neechan, wait! What on earth is going on here? Let's go too. We're going, Shippou-chan! Right! Hey! Don't you dare leave me behind! Does no one else live on this island? Nope, just us. There were lots of people a long time ago, but they all died. That song back there was pretty gloomy. What's it called? That's the "Song of Separation.'' Kanade-sama said originally it was "The Song of Mourning.'' Kanada-sama? The Miko priestess of the shrine. Ah, so of course she must be a beautiful woman..... Kanade-sama isn't here anymore. She died while fighting The Four War Gods. Now as we must offer a sacrifice to The Four War Gods.... Shion, don't blab on carelessly! A sacrifice? That definitely doesn't sound very pleasant. Don't tell me you're planning on dying! Asagi-chan! Asagi-chan! Very soon, I will become a firefly. A firefly? All these fireflies are people who dove into the Meidou no Kama. They are the souls of the villagers who have died. Included are our father, mother older brother and sister too. Everyone turned into fireflies and protected us. So we aren't lonely or anything. I will become a firefly in order to protect these kids. So please, don't interfere. Asagi-chan I don't like this at all. It is said that the Meidou no Kama originally was the holy protector for the... youkai and humans who lived here, as well as their hanyou offspring. However, The Four War Gods came and tainted it. The Four War Gods use the jaded Kama to drain our hanyou strength and receive holy power. Countless people have been sacrificed now. When the island connects to the outside world once every 50 years, the Kama calls for a sacrifice. After Asagi-neechan, it'll be me or Dai. It's hot in here, isn't it? I feel some very unusual jyaki (jyaki - negative energy/aura) So this is the Meidou no Kama. I can definitely feel the evil energy. Geez, it's huge! Goodbye everyone! Live on together and try to get along. Asagi-oneechan, I don't want you to go! Listen, I will become a firefly and then protect all of you. There's got to be another way to leave the island without doing this! Let's t to think of something else. We'll help you exterminate the youkai. Asagi-neechan, let's accept their help. You guys don't understand how scary The Four War Gods are. But! By making one sacrifice, the rest of you can live on for a while. It's not for their sake, but for yours! Don't follow me! Nice try, but I don't think so. If I don't destroy the barrier's source, I can't leave here. If you're scared, don't dive in. Stop it! We don't want your help! Kaze no Kizu!! Dammit! I said 'stop it!' If I sacrifice myself, everyone will be saved. Shut the hell up! Don't take death so lightly. Inuyasha! Asagi-oneechan! Inuyasha! Inuyasha! Get a grip! We're not dead yet! Don't give up yet, you stupid idiot! Shit! What the? Asagi! Don't you dare give up! What....is that? Asagi-neechan! It appears that our lives have been connected to the hanyou power. God Dammit! How long do we have to do this? There are 5 hanyou children left. Before they have all been sacrificed, we must do our utmost to reclaim our real power. Isn't that the reason we prepared that Miko? Asagi has plunged into the Kama. That poor child! But where is her firefly form? I wonder if she's still alive? No good. We're getting nowhere! What's gonna happen to Inuyasha and Asagi? Hey you two, get back! Cut it out, it's not doing any good! No one has evercome out of the Kama. They're both dead. You can't just give up like that! There has to be a way! These inscriptions, I wonder if there's some meaning to it them. Father once told me "The youkai are the hand that protects.'' Mother once told me "The humans are the hand that nurtures.'' That's the song from before. The words of the ancient song are written on the door. "The hand that protects." Do you know what that means? The left hand, isn't it obvious? Sheesh, you don't even know that! Okay then, "The hand that nurtures", means... The right hand. What comes next in the song? When both hands are joined, the door will open From inside the crimson flames, thou is returned. We, the children, are the light that defends. When both hands work together, the door will open Houshi-sama, that would mean... Yes, when the le hand of a youkai and the right hand of a human are joined, the door will open. Hmphf, no good. They almost seemed somewhat dependable too! I wonder what is meant by "joining hands?'' W-w-what're those?!? Poisonous fire insests! Shit! My vision's getting blurry. Is there no way out of here? For you to have come here alive... You must be a hanyou. How is it that the crimson flames cannot touch you? Hmm, it's probably thanks to my fire-rat robe. More importantly who the hell are you? We are Kanade, the Miko who protects Houraijima. In that case let me ask you... What the hell happened on this island? Kaza-ana! Houshi-sama, those are poisonous insects! Don't over-do it! Get eaten by poisonous bugs or the Kama? Which one do you prefer? "Which one?'' you say! Let's look for clues to solve the riddle in the song. Moegi-chan! Moegi! Oh well, why don't we help look too? Yeah, let's look. With my expert techniques... Shippou-chan, over here. The forbidden shall leave their vessel. The heirs will be thrown out into hardship. Should open and benevolent a heart thy possess, Thine hand shall be received here. That's it! Kagome, we've solved the song's riddle. Since long ago, Houraijima was a place where youkai and humans could live together peacefully. Before long, many hanyou children were born. Everyone lived together in harmony. However, the hanyou children were feared by other humans and despised by youkai. Life outside the village was extremely difficult for them. Thus, in order to protect the future of these children, we disappeared from the outside world forevermore. But once every 50 years, aiming for the island's weakened barrier, we were repeatedly attacked by youkai. And then The Four War Gods came. A tremendous amount of blood was spilled. We fought as well, but it took all our strength to seal their jewels of power and plunge ourselves into the KAMA. However, they realized they could reclaim a portion of their power by sacrifiicing living hanyous into the fire of the KAMA. Why hanyous? Fundamentally, the spiritual power of humans and the physical strength of youkai repel each other. However inside hanyous, these blend. When the differing forces in hanyous dissipate, they become the power to run this Kama. Ready and Pull! Are you okay? Of course we're not okay! Well suck it up and try again! We're good to go over here, Shippou chan. Here too. ON TWO THREE! It worked! Huh? What's that light? That light. This cannot be, the door was opened! Which means that's the exit. The KAMA will be robbed of its power. Very well. With the scarce amount ofremaining life we have, we will help you. In exchange, we would like you to save these children. What happens to the brats is up to them. All I'm gonna do is defeat of The Four War Gods. That will be enough. We are counting on you. Asagi, I'm gonna getyou outta here now. Is it alright for me to live? Don't ask such bloody annoying questions! Wait a moment. Kanade-sama? What's going on? Why isn't anything happening? I guess you weren't powerful enough for it to work. He's a runt too. What's this? It is the TAMAKUSHIGE NO HAKO. (Sacred Chest) It contains the Four War Gods' sealed jewels of power which we have protected until now. Under no circumstances should you open it. If it is opened, it is all over. The jewels will return to the Four War Gods and they will be unstoppable. Then it'll be okay if I just destroy the box, right? Kagome, can you hear me? Inuyasha, are you alive? What about Asagi-chan? She's with me. I'm going to break down the door. Get out of the way! Got it! Ok everybody, we have to move away from the door. Inuyasha and Asagi chan are coming out. Sango! Asagi-chan, forgive me. We may have been mistaken. All of you, be happy. We will watch over you. Kanade-sama. KON GOU SOU HA!!! Stupid Inuyasha, hasn't he ever heard of "restraint"? That blockhead! Whew, it's nice and cool out here! Asagi-neechan! Ai! You guys! Asagi-neesan!! TAMAKUSHIGE NO HAKO- It seems it has left the KAMA. Hmphf, taking the trouble to go and get them for us... He's a considerate jackass. Finally we can get our real powers back. You're getting ahead of things. First we have to get the chest, you know. It's as good a time as ever. Why don't we try testing the Miko's power? Here..... we..... g-g-g-g-g-go! Oh look. He can't break it. Even though he went spouting off about how great he was! No good mutt! At any rate, it looks like the barrier around the box is very strong. Kagome with her strong spiritual powers could open it, but.. But we're not supposed to open it, remember. Where ARE Kagome's arrows? Huh? Where did I put those darn things again? Um, aren't those them? Sorry! Looks like we've got a bunch of geniuses! You said it! You buttheads! And what have YOU done? Think a bit before you mouth off! K-Kikkyou? Inuyasha! Is everyone okay? Yeah, we're fiine. It looks like Tessaiga's sheath protected us. She took the box! Kikkyou! Was that really Kikkyou? That Kikkyou didn't smell like burial soil. Inuyasha! Kagome, get the brats off the island! Inuyasha. This would be what they call a 'love triangle'. So he's a two-timing chump? What are you two doing? We're leaving NOW! Yes Ma'am! Yep, she's mad! Kagome-oneechan is scary! Good work. Quick, open it. Wait, Kikkyou! Did you come back to get your old girlfriend or something? You fuckheads! Go ahead. Open it, Kikkyou! No stop! Don't you know me? Hmm, I wonder? This Kikkyou was made from blood sucked up by Goura 50years ago. It's revenge! What did you say? It was all to get our hands on the chest and reclaim the stolen jewels. You see, we can't break the barrier. Come on, open it already! STOP! It's been so long! SEITENHO!! SHA SHAKU NUTSU JOU!! Kikkyou! What a wuss! Can't even fight a girl! Alright then, before we ditch Houraijima, lets kill the rest of the villagers. It's them! Let's go! Kagome chan, Shippou. Look after the kids. Okay. Got it. Just leave it to me! As long as those children bear the Crimson Scar of the Four War Gods, we cannot take them away from the island. In that case, the only way is to defeat those jerks. Hiraikotsu! Shit! She just keeps following me! See, just like we told you. We haven't used a boat for decades! Oneechan, let's make one. Yeah. We can just make one! Let's do it. Shippou-chan, take Dai-kun, Roku-kun and Shion-kun to gather some logs. If possible get ones that are straight and of the same length and thickness. Whatever! I guess we don't have a choice! Ok guys, follow me! Hey, listen to your leader! Moegi-chan and Ai-chan, would you look for some rope to tie the wood with and some large cloth. Right! Asagi-chan, you'll help me with building the raft, okay? Sure. This is not the real Kikkyou! I know that but... I've been waiting for you, Sessyoumaru-sama. Very well, I will gladly be your opponent. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Don't just run away all day! Hiraikotsu! Seitenho! It doesn't look like we can just drive them off and strike. But Houshi-sama, your Kaza-ana is still... For something like this, it'll be fiine. Kaza-ana! My Seitenho! Unforgivable! This is the glory of... my true... power! Dammit! I just... I can't... K-K-Kiyyou! To let your heart be disturbed by an abomination like that! How pathetic. Syaku Nutsu! Isn't this delightful, Sesshoumaru-sama? You and I are one of the same. I think not. To obtain the greatest pleasure in fighting. To feel most alive when trying to kill. So where do you and I differ? Do not include me in your group of lowly youkai trash. Ku jyuu ku su! Well then please enlighten me about the depth of my inferiority. You are not even worth my breath. SYOU RYUU HA! What is wrong? Was that all there was to that attack? I only fight the ultimate in strong opponents.. Not filth like you. Asagi neechan. A Crimson Scar mark onyour back has disappeared! Really? It's true! One of The Four War Gods must have been defeated. But just one! There's still three of them left. Kagome-oneechan, we can be saved, right? Yes....Absolutely. Okay everyone, there's just a bit let to do. Let's work hard. Right. Shion, bring the rope over here. Sure. What's up, Shio... Ryuura! What are you runts being all secretive about over there? Shion-kun! You don't have to be in such a panic to get out of here! After all, as long as you have just one of the Crimson Scar marks, you can never leave. I-I'm sorry. Your time is over! Get out of our way! I don't mind spirited girls, you know. Yeah, but I detest guys like you. Only a coward would get off on bullying children! Yeah, what she said! You psycho! We know by the way. One of you was beaten. You just watch, Inuyasha will round you all up and finish you off. Whatever. I hate lectures. Plus, I just can't get very excited about fighting a puny human female and a hanyou. Hey, I'm a full-fledged youkai! It was a mistake to allow that human female to live back at the beach. It's best to snuff out those with spiritual powers straight away. Hirai... This is a blast. Sango, let's take one down with the other. Kirara! You little buggers, like I'll let you escape! Now, Sango! Got it! As ifI'd fall forthat! Nope, you completely fell for it. Kaza ana! Good, just one more left! Oof!!! Kagome-oneechan! Don't worry. I'll take good care of the little snots. Hey, Ryuura! One more mark has disappeared. There's just two left. Iguess The Four War Gods aren't so hot after all, huh? Hey, don't say an hing to piss him off! No, he's right. You Four War Gods are weak. Moegi! No, he's right. You Four War Gods are weak. Moegi! Get away from Kagome oneechan! Get away from Kagome-oneechan! We're not scared of you jerks anymore! Get off this island! Just.. Leave. Oh my god, we're gonna die! No worries, I'd never fight for real with rug rats. Transform! Shippou-chan! Is everyone okay? Thank you, Shippou-niichan! Hm Huh? Oh! Inuyasha-niichan!! Inuyasha!! Get the friggin' hell away from Kagome! Your opponent is me! You're 100 years too early to be fighting us Four War Gods! Inuyasha! What's with all this god crap? You just made it up on you own! KAZE NO KIZU!! CHI RYOU HUUIN! Oh yeah, eat this! SAN GOU SOU HA!! You naive prick! Who do you think I am? Wha-? Inuyasha ni!.chan! Hang in there, Inuyasha-niichan. Inuyasha... Inuyasha-Niichan Well that was mildly amusing You guys are crazy! You can't beat him! Get him! You friggin'shithead! Don't get all cocky! Darn it. We haven't lost yet! Inuyasha That's enough, get backyou guys! Inuyasha! Inuyasha-niichan! I understand how you kids feel. To want to leave this island... Not wanting to die... Having the will to fight for yourselves... The desire to defeat The Four War Gods... I understand. So... Leave the rest to me. One more left. Is he trying to destroy the island? Inuyasha! Goura is attacking the village! The island will probably end up sinking. Well then all we have to do is slice up that crappy giant turtle! Inuyasha! Take this! Here goes! BAKU RYUU HA!! He did it! Inuyasha-niichan is awesome! I guess he did okay. But, there's still one mark left. Huh? What do you mean? Are you okay, Inuyasha? Like you have to worry about me! So, the true form fiinally shows its face! Kagome! What? What the heck are you spacing out for? Let's go! But I already told you I don't have my bow and arrows! I didn't ask about that. Just get some! How am I supposed to do that? I can change into a bow, but I can't turn into holy arrows. That guy looks seriously bad. Can Inuyasha take him on? Help me everyone! Look for anything that looks like it can be used as an arrow! If possible, fiind some thin, straight wood. Just like how we did before? Exactly. Kaa san. (Kaa-san=mother) Shion! Shion! Hang in there, Shion! We're with you. Kirara! The fun has only begun! Shit! Kagome-neesan! Shion! Shion! Asagi-neesan! Inuyasha! Neechan! Grab-hold. Let's go. Right! Kaza-ana! Miroku! Hiraikotsu! You fucker! Kagome! Kagome-neesan! Shippou-chan! Is everybody okay?
