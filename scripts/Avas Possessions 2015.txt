Vanquish this diabolic being. Protect this young woman, body and soul, from all spiritual poison. In the name of Jesus Christ, our lord and savior... young woman... Hello, gorgeous. Hello, Ava. I'm father merino. Your parents asked me to be here to help. Boy it's nice to, to see the real you. You see, I've been here for a while... But it wasn't you that I was talking with. I-it was an ancient, malicious entity, and it's gone now. It's not possible. No, no. This is a joke, right? This is... this is a joke. I know you're frightened and exhausted and confused, but it's not a joke. You've been being controlled by a spirit that was not your own. Okay, okay. Let's pray. Dear father in heaven. Thank you for returning Ava, to this life. How are you feeling, Ava? There she is. Hey Ava, you look great. Hope you're hungry. Cut it out. What? She looks great. How long has it been? It's been a month, Ava. Did anyone call in sick for me? Uh... I doubt it. More lo mein? No, I'm good, thanks. Ava. This thing that managed to get inside of you should be a real wake-up call. Are you, uh, are you still smoking marijuana? Are you seriously blaming me for getting possessed? I mean, it's a gateway drug, okay? I wish you would let us put you in a hotel. Your father's right, darling. You really can't live like this. I didn't have time to clean. Oh Ava, it's a dump. It doesn't matter how much you clean it up. Well, we're gonna come back and check on you. Whatever, just call first. Uh-huh. Oh, sweetie. I guess the district attorney, uh, has several videos like this. And you're up for indictment for multiple charges. Wait, what other charges? What other charges? Ava, you... Property damage, assault, indecent exposure, two counts of possession... Narcotics. I mean, we're talking about serious jail time here. Jail? Bloody maniac, running through the streets, like, hurting people usually go to jail. Yeah. Your... your... your parents are lobbying to put you in some kind of residential facility. But I don't belong in a facility. No, you don't, you don't belong in a facility. There is a third option and it's called, uh, spirit possession anonymous. It's funded by the government. It's in association with the church, go figure. And you go through the treatment and... And they erase all the charges. One thing, you are required to study this handbook so you're prepared for the first day. It's kind of, uh, like aa for people like you. Okay, yeah, I'll go with option three. Okay, I'm gonna inform the judge right now. I think you made a fantastic decision, sweetheart. Hello? Hey Carl, it's me. I'd love to hear your voice. I really miss you. Please call me back as soon as you get this. How 'bout tomorrow? Okay, just let him know I'm feeling better and I can come back to work. Okay. "To Conrad. Thirty years of wedded bliss." Who's Conrad? Hello? Hey, how's it goin'? Uh... are you better now? I guess so. Sarah says hi. Hi, Sarah. Do you guys maybe want to hang out later? She wants to hang out. Um... Sarah asks if it's safe. Tell Sarah to wear a raincoat 'cause I've got pea soup spraying out of my butt. That's an exorcist reference. Yeah, I know, it was funny. She sounds normal. Okay. We'll text you. Cheers! So... was it kinda like being pregnant? 'Cause you had this thing inside of you. I pictured that as being a more beautiful experience. W-what are you gonna do about picking up the pieces of your life? My life's not really in pieces. I just have a few things to sort out. It'll be back to normal next week. Totally. Yeah. Whoo. So what's up with Roxanne's birthday party? Did it change? Um, well, you're sort of not invited anymore. People are just really freaked out still. Yeah. And you sort of acted like a mega-bitch while you were possessed. And a slut. W-which is fine, but you did sleep with Roxanne's boyfriend. Does Carl know? I don't know the detail... I just heard. Ava... What is it? Do you hear that? Hear what? Something's wrong with her. Fuck, I knew we shouldn't have come here! Ava, are you okay? What just happened, Ava? Nothing. I-I-I... I-I just drank that too fast. You guys should just go 'cause you're gonna be late. Are you upset? No, no, I just, I have a lot of stuff to do and, uh, pieces of my life to pick up and whatnot. Okay. Well, we'll give Roxanne a kiss for you. Oh, I'm sure she'll love that. Oh, shit! Shh! Shh! Uh... did I...? No, I'm sorry, Darlene. You can try again, okay? Alright, that's it for today. Louie, Casey, get her out of this thing please. I really apologize... Don't ever come late again. I'm sorry. Alright, let's go get your files so you can be prepared for the next time. What was that necklace? If you read the manual, you'd know. It's a spirit steeper, you put it on and the last spirit that possessed you is invited back. We record everything on that camera there, and we chart your progress. If you can remove the spirit steeper on your own, while possessed, then you've completed the training. If I have to remove it for you, then... The therapy continues. There's also a lot of homework. You're gonna have some pretty uncomfortable conversations with your family and your friends. Yeah, I think I already stumbled into those. You need to look for clues, piece together lost memories. What is all this stuff? Old cases... files on everyone, even before I worked here. Dates back to 1982, I think. This is your priest report on your uninvited spiritual guest. People you hurt or injured while you were possessed. You're gonna need to make amends with them. Does it say why it chose me? No, it doesn't. The goal is not to determine why. Is it possible, my demon... We don't use the "d" word here. Did you even look at the manual? I'm sorry. Yeah, I flipped through it. Is it possible it's my fault? Well, it could be random, or karmic, or induced by a third party. But more important than placing blame is preventing it from happening again. I've been seeing... Crazy visions. Like waking nightmares. That's the spirit. It's trying to come back. "Naphula is a six-foot-one-inch tall succubus," "a feline hybrid of a dragon, bird and goat." "He is depicted carrying a drum. The sound of the drums signals his approach." That's her. Hi. I know who you are. Demon! No. Be gone! Go away! I'm better now! Be gone! I-I'm... I'm happy to take the time, just keep your distance. The cops brought you in for a psych evaluation. They said they wanted you sedated. You'd been jumping over cars causing accidents. But when I went to administer the benzodiazepine, you broke though the cuffs on the stretcher, and you chewed right through my finger. Specifically? You shoved your tongue down my throat and smashed my head into the ATM three times. I'm sorry. Did I... Say anything? Yeah, you did actually. " Ad miseriam esurio ." Over and over. I looked it up because it was ringing through my head for days, driving me crazy. It's Latin. It means "for your misery, I hunger." Hey Carl, it's me... Again. Uh, I guess you're upset at me. I am so, so sorry... Hello. Hey. Hi. You're there. Yeah. Look, please stop calling me. Wait Carl, I'm better now. Can we please just meet and talk about this? No. I don't, I don't want to see you anymore. Look, we broke up. But... I-I get that you don't remember, but it's over. Ava, honestly, forget about him. If a demon isn't an excuse for a little indiscretion, I don't know what is. Ooh. "Say goodbye to split ends." What if my possession wasn't an excuse, though. What if it's bad Karma, like mom said. Mom has her own issues. They have nothing to do with you. She just thinks they do. Hi everybody, my name's Ava. My uninvited spiritual guest possessed me for 28 days and was exorcised on Tuesday. Tell us its name. Naphula, the anointed. In the grand scheme of the 36 legions of hell, he's sort of the, uh, entitled, arrogant rich kid. He likes to come up for joyrides in human bodies. And he carries a drum... That he beats as he approaches. Mine was drekavac, the cursed. He's from the souls of murdered babies. My evil spirit's orivus, he made me eat my dog. Guys... Let's let Ava talk, okay? I found this in my couch, and I don't know how it go there. Oh, that could be a good place to start. "To Conrad. For thirty years of wedded bliss." Do you know who this Conrad is? No. This is a cheri Cher watch. There's a store in Soho. Abaddon, the annihilator shoplifted from there. That's my demon's name. The "d" word, Hazel. Such a pointless rule. Hazel! Don't make this any more serious than it already is. Anything else? There was a... A little blood on the floor in my living room. But I don't know whose blood it is. Probably your own. It could be animal blood. Did you have any pets? Louie, haven't we talked about this? Barnabas is in a better place now. Hey, new girl. Got the hots for Tony yet? Mmm, not really my type. What's going on between you and him? He caught me sneaking in there a couple weeks ago so I'm on thin ice. Or whatever. You broke into the church? Yeah, I want that amulet he's got. The spirit steeper? But why? Is it worth a lot? Probably. I would use it to get my demon back. Why would you wanna do that? There was a connection between us. And I think it was special for him too. I was the first girl. Abaddon, the annihilator had ever been inside of. In that way. And he's got this sexy scar on the side of his cheek from when an archangel slashed him. Anyway, I gotta go. I'll see you at the next one. Alright. You didn't have to help. Don't you have a giant wedding to plan? Oh, uh, we pushed back the date. Not because of what happened to you, we just needed more time. Look what I got... To replace the one grandpa gave me. It's exactly the same, right? Oh. It got destroyed? No, it went missing. I remember not being able to find it. It's one of the last memories I had... Before the demon. Ava? You okay? What's wrong? I'm okay. I'm okay. Whoa, whoa! Okay, okay, alright. I got her, I got her. Okay. Let's get her in your bed. Why are you acting like this is your fault? She's not your responsibility. It's just that things are different now. Exactly. And if we're not careful, she's going to find out what happened. You know, I gotta say, I'm with mom and dad on this one. She's not fit to take care of herself. She needs to go away for a while, get some proper care. You need to stop calling them mom and dad. I'm part of the family now. Just... We're not married yet. Well, we might as well be, after what I did. Hey, Ava. How ya feeling? A little better, thanks. These came for you while you were asleep. Maybe you've got a secret admirer. They're from my boss. A bunch of the bands I represent signed it. They want me to come back. See? Things are gonna get back to normal in no time. Where's Hank? Someone needs to check on the girls backstage, I'll be back in a minute. Ava, no way! You're looking good. Thanks. How's it been going? It's going good. Apparently, you've got a new single. Duke, we're ready! Go see. La, la, la, la, la... La, la, la, la, la... Ava, Ava. Ava. Jesus, Ava, I'm-I'm sorry if the song upset you, but... You're not really releasing that, are you? It's clearly a hit. It's not funny. It really happened. Maybe the lyrics are a metaphor. Yeah, it's like poetic license. Shut up, Hank. He looks like a sex offender in that outfit. You know what, little Dukie, I found you, I signed you, and I decide what sounds like a single. And it's not this. Maybe it's not time for you to come back and start making decisions just yet. Thanks for the get-well-soon card, assholes. Hi, I found a cheri Cher watch I'd like to return to the owner. There's an inscription on it. It says, um, "to Conrad." Thirty years of wedded bliss." Okay. Hi, I'm supposed to meet with Ben. Ben just stepped in the back for a moment. He'll be right out. Have I been here before? I don't know. I'm sorry, um, perhaps you'd like to join our mailing list. You sure you don't recognize me? Should I? No, no, no. Not if you don't. Ava. Yes. Ben? Thank you for going through all the trouble with calling the store and coming here. It's a damn good watch. Where did you find it? On the street outside of my building. So you've never met my father? Your father? Conrad. Oh. This was a gift from my mother to him. She passed away a few years ago. That's why the store contacted me. Well I'd really like to meet Conrad, if at all possible. He's away on business, a lot. What kind of business? Art, among other things. He owns this gallery with me. I-I-I should really get going. It was really nice to meet you. So, what do you do? Nothing anymore. I was fired. Ooh. Are you a bad girl? You need to learn to be a little more cutthroat. Well, when I was possessed, I cut some throats. Snarl. Stretch out your facial muscles. Remember, when you face the dark spirits, they must also face you. She is a riot, man. She is a real riot. Told you. No, really. Ava, please not here. I was possessed. You all have a target on your back, people. Once you've been possessed, you are ten times more likely to be repossessed, revisited. So let's not make it easy for 'em, shall we. More angry. Do not let them take you over. It's your body, claim possession, claim ownership, claim the right to your existence. Hazel, hit the goddamn thing! Come on, harder! Two hands, go. Two hands. Come on, Hazel. Come on, Hazel! That was embarrassing. Fastest date in history. Well, if he can't accept my inner demons, then fuck him. Totally. Hi, Ava. Hi, mom. I told you to call first. You're not supposed to be drinking. Haven't you heard, I can handle my spirits. Oh, you think it's funny? What are you, some kind of expert. How can you possibly know what this has been like for me? I just know, okay? I've had my share of difficulties. Zinc, one a day, with meals. Here's your calcium. Something happened here that you guys aren't telling me. I found blood under the rug over there. Someone tried to cover it up. Well, you hurt yourself, we cleaned it up. So? Part of my therapy is I have to confront all of the bad things that I did head on. I hope you're not spilling your guts to those hippies. Those hippies are the only people helping me recover. Trust me when I say you don't want to know any more. Just leave it alone. Ginseng... Hey Tony, you said the possession could be induced by a third party. How? What did you mean by that? By invoking runic or psychokinetic energy. Maleficium or Vamachara. What's that? Black magic. Truth is we don't know exactly how it works. It's like breaking and entering. Spectral doorways open, the barrier's weakened. Spirit slips in. The whole point of what we do here is to make you possession-proof. Lay the right foundational bricks so that no one or no thing can ever get in again. Remember me, doll-face? You chewed my ear like a little rat. Well you danced with the wrong matador, 'cause I will carve out your fuckin' eyes. Now I want my money. Plus interest. Plus damages. Plus fuck you. I don't remember. I'm sorry. Oh, you don't remember? You don't remember Noelle with your titties in her face? Now I don't care if you're a girl or a boy or a pig or a dog or a monkey vegetarian, or an episcopalian. If you're with one of Escobar's girls, you gotta pay... One way or another. Now open up your wallet and show me your money. And your jewelry too. Ow, ow, ow. Come on, Darlene, you can do it. I mean, what are the odds that two twin sisters both get possessed. Maybe it's genetic? I heard that can happen. What are you doing Saturday? Do you wanna hang out? Sure. Fight it. Fight this spirit, fight it. C'mon. C'mon. Fight it. You can do it. I know you can do it! That a girl! You did it. Give me this. - Cheers! - Thank you. Cut my hand as a warning, I guess. And ran off. Sounds like he was some sort of pimp or something, which explains why he's not on the list of people pressing charges against you. Did he tell you the name of the woman? Yeah, Noelle. Maybe she's a prostitute. You're gonna have to talk to Noelle. You're gonna have to meet her in person. How am I supposed to find her? There's nothing easy about this process, Ava. Some of these people have been coming here for years with little or no progress. You know what Hazel would say? You keep us chasing the past, so that you can keep this place filled up, so you've got a job. That sound's like something Hazel would say. What do you say? I'd say... Did I really do something when I was possessed that your average scumbag hasn't already done? That's a pretty bleak outlook, Ava. You may want to change your perspective. I got you a little present. Oh, that's nice. Thanks for the Jade elephant. That's... J.J... What do you, want do you want from me? What do you, what do you... What do you want me to do? You got a guy in city hall who can like track down people? Yes. How about a prostitute? Wait, a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Are you, are you trying to get me a prostitute right now? No, it's part of my therapy. Is that two separate thoughts there? I gotta find people and talk to them, make amends. You want me to track down a prostitute for you? Yes, please. I like where this is going. Hello? Hi, this is Ben Branson. - Oh, hi. - Could I ask you to, um, come out for a drink with me, as a thank you? Conrad would say that's the decent thing to do for returning his watch. Yeah, sure. I thought we were going out for a drink. More fitting gift, would be letting you chose whatever you like. Are you serious? You can take any piece you want. Unless you don't like anything. I like this one. This is one of my favorites. Leda and the swan. That's a swan? It's actually the Greek god Zeus. He took the form of a swan in order to seduce a woman named Leda. I thought it was an angel. Greek gods are kind of like fallen angels. Is this Conrad? Yes. I don't think I could work for my family. I can relate. I love that Conrad travels. Let's me run this place the way I want. That's good... That you know what you want. Sorry, it's my lawyer calling. J.J.? What's up, kiddo? Uh, I have a lead on that Noelle woman you're looking for. You have a number? Uh, no, I have an address, and I hear she's only there for another hour. Tonight? Yeah, tonight. What? Come on. Oh, shit. Ben, I'm so sorry I have to go. It was nice to see you again. But... Your loss, baby. You'll be back. Take a look at that guy. Take a look at this bitch. There's that crazy bitch that chewed up Escobar. Hey, is one of you Noelle? You remember me? How could I forget. What do you want? You're gonna have to pay first. I'm talkin' Benjamins. Can we talk somewhere? Yeah. Welcome back to hotel Noelle. Oh, wow. This is nice. So I-I don't remember the night we met. No, no, no, no, no. I just wanna talk. I don't say no to money, honey, but I ain't no psychoanalyst. Listen, I'll be out of your way in five minutes. I just need to know what happened that night. You really don't remember anything. No. I was possessed... By a demon. Holy fuck. Is that contagious? I don't think so. Good. 'Cause I've got enough problems without that shit. Okay, well, I just need to know how I found you, what I said to you. Yeah, I was in here with some guy, and you showed up and climbed in. You stripped down to your underwear and next thing I know we were all going at it. I saw you earlier, you were like following him, I think. I figured you were his wife or girlfriend or something. I've seen people play all sorts of kinky games. So we knew each other? Definitely. He really liked you. His name wasn't Conrad, was it? I don't do names, baby. Okay. I'm gonna give you my number. If you can please try to find out any more information on the guy, call me. Oh fuck, it's Escobar! Get your little ass out here! I swear to god, she made, she made me! Now let me get this straight. You come to my Chuck e cheese and you throw your own goddamn pizza party? I told you Escobar's girls are off limits to you bitch. Do you have a death wish? Now if I catch you around here again, I will snuff out your little light. I know how it feels, Ava. All my friends hate me now too. Except Eliza, who I saved from a rapist. I beat the shit out of him with supernatural strength? That's fucking awesome. Wow. I don't think mine did anything heroic like that. Oh, yeah, and I was way more effective at PR. I got a raise, the clients said I was more fun to be around. I mean, eventually I got fired for ripping my co-worker's hair out. But what if you could control a demon? You know, like training an animal, like how people can learn to fly in their dreams. I guess that would be pretty cool. Yeah. Hey, wanna do something crazy? Look, there's only three of these stores in New York. Tony sent my photo to all of them, so they won't sell to me. There's some black magic website, but I hate shopping online. So, all I have to do is buy this spell for you? And perform it. I can't perform my own spell. What makes you think I can even do that? You've been possessed before. What makes you think I would do that? You're my friend. You do realize that if we break Tony's rules, we could get in a lot of trouble. Have Tony's rules helped you at all? Have you had any results from his therapy? - Hello. - Hi. I-I'm here to pick up a demonium invitabo spell. Mm-hmm. First time? Yeah. I should warn you, it'll change you. Oh, no, I've been possessed before. I meant invocation. The spell. Forces like these, they leave their mark. The instructions are inside, all the ingredients for the potion, the incantation. Do you need a ceremonial cloak, or do you have your own? What's that? That's just the frog. It's supposed to be sedated. You need to sacrifice it. I have to sacrifice it? Oh, Jesus. I just hope there are no more surprises. Good luck with that. Okay. So, almost done. You just have to "burn an item that belonged to the host," that's me, "...Since childhood" and read this... Aw, I had one of these. Are you sure you want me to... Yeah, yeah. It's worth it. Yeah, and you know, give it a couple hours, at least, before you call the priest... So we can have a little fun. Okay. Here we go: " Abyssus abyssum invocat-" saeternum- Terra es, terram ibis- ecce quomodo moritur, hoc sustinate damnosa hereditas... Hazel! Are you okay? Hazel, is it working? What have I done? Oh. Oh, my god, please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me, please... You're... you're really hot, really hot. You're really hot. And... and... You're... You're really pretty. That's the spirit. Oh! Oh shit! Oh, my god, what happened? Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with her? I think she wanted your soda or something. Psycho bitch bit my arm. Or maybe she had rabies. Where did she go? She fucking climbed that building over there. Hi, father, it's Ava. Sorry to call so late, but a friend of mine, a girl named Hazel, might show up on your radar. She's possessed. Uh, please call me if you hear anything. Hey. What are you doing here? You're on our mailing list. Oh, right. You forgot this... Do you wanna come inside? Do you want to talk about why you left in such a hurry? No. I'll just, um, leave this here. Do you want me to leave? No. What... What happened to your head? What's wrong? I didn't put you here, Alice. What is wrong with you? Why won't you talk to me, I'm your mother. I have nothing to talk about. I have to come clean about something. What? I, um... I lied about where I found the watch. It was in my apartment. Conrad was here, and you do know him. This is awkward. What? My friend's in the hospital. The church will cover the costs for any broken equipment. We have insurance for that. We're gonna take her to a residential facility. Ava, thank you for coming so quickly. She's been asking for you desperately. They're about to take her away. Where? Someplace where she won't be a danger to herself or anyone else. You should speak to her, but... go in alone. God bless. I'll be right back. Hi, Hazel. Ava, I'm so sorry. I- I hope you're not in trouble, but it was so worth it. I mean, I remember everything this time. Like, every little detail. I jumped off your roof. You? You mean, Abaddon... No, it was both of us. We were one. I mean, it wasn't a battle. I wasn't fighting him and he wasn't controlling me. I made him stronger, and he made me stronger, and it was better than the best heroin, the best ecstasy, better than any dick I've ever had. Hazel, I-I don't need to know that... Yes, you do. That's why I wanted to see you, to tell you, because you believe me. Sure demons are dark, but they're just our shadows. Like black matter or like a doughnut hole, like negative space. Nothing makes you more complete than total union with your shadow. Tony, I, uh, I really don't feel ready for this. Nobody passes the first time. It's all just part of the training process. When you learn how to ski, you don't expect to make it down the black diamond trail the first try, right? So, this is gonna be your bunny slope. I don't ski. You're gonna be fine. What, what? What have you done? You got a thaumaturgic mark on your skin. Right on your neck. What? Shit. What does it mean? It means you've appealed to a left-handed mode of witchery. It also means I can't help you anymore. Oh, come on, Tony. I'm so close. These dark powers that you're just playing with, once they mark you, they weaken you. Any form of magic, no matter what the intention, can invite evil inside. All the progress, all the work we've done... It's for nothing. Wow, once a week. I don't even know if any of this is gonna work, but let's try... Excuse me. We'll make it... What is this? Excuse me... What is this thing on my neck? You've got these things all over you. I told you... Some spells leave a mark. I thought you meant metaphorically. Like, like visiting the Grand Canyon or walking in on your dad naked. I meant the high cost that must be paid for summoning such powers. But this was just for a friend though. You summoned the demon. You awoke the darkness. You have the mark. Excuse me, I'm with someone. She's crazy. She's crazy. The judge knows you were kicked out of group. I don't see any other choice. The only alternative is jail. This is best for you, Ava. Everyone who goes into these places comes out ever crazier. You were kicked out of demon aa. It doesn't get much crazier. It's quiet, it's tranquil... It's in the Adirondacks. It's where you should have gone in the first place, but he wouldn't listen to me. J.J. Must have other ideas. Well, J.J.'S been let go. What? We didn't like the way he handled certain things, so we let him go. He enabled you to look up some prostitute, and you got attacked... He was helping me. That was part of my therapy... Well, that's some therapy. Oh, my god, who would have thought our family would be so vulnerable to demons. Honey, you have to go away. Hello? Hey, it's Noelle. Hey, Noelle. What'd you find out. I got a name for you. Car's downstairs. You almost packed? One of the girls took that guy you were looking for to a room where they had to put down a credit card. What's his name? Was it Conrad Branson? I'm not telling you anything until you give me more money. You know where to find me. Okay, okay I'll figure it out. I'll be there as soon as I can. You know the prostitute? The one J.J. Helped me find? I need to see her, tonight. Why? I can't tell you. What? Please, I have to see her. Please. Alright, listen. I'll cover for ya. I'll say that you, you ran away. Thanks, dad, but I have to pay her. Can I borrow 200 bucks? Oh, shit. No way. No way. What the hell you do? You killed Noelle dead. What, no. Somebody did, bitch. I've got some scripture wisdom for your white ass. An eye for an eye. You know about that bitch? I'm gonna take it out on you. You're gonna pay. Escobar... I've had a really bad month. You do not want to fuck with me right now. Okay. Escobar can turn the other cheek. There's no need for trouble. Are you okay? Oh, my god. Ben. Oh, my god. Are you following me? What? I'm trying to protect you. Ava! I saved your fuckin' life back there. Why were you even there? Ava, Ava, please. Listen to me. When you told me that Conrad was in your apartment, I realized you're in danger. He does a lot of illegal business. Someone must have wanted you out of the picture. What? Ava, he kills people, for a living, for money. Why would someone want to kill me? I don't know. But maybe if we can figure out where he went after he left your apartment that night... I can't, I... What, you can't remember? I don't know. Let me protect you. I don't know if you can. I'm sorry. Look, J.J. You're the only person I can trust right now. Everyone's gonna think I killed Noelle. If I go home, they're gonna send me away. You did the right thing coming here. It's the first smart thing you did all day. Thanks for helping me. You know that your parents, uh... They fired me. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Ugh, fucking hell. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. First things first, you need some rest. I got a spot for you, come on. God, what are you doing here so late anyways? Um, some of us work. The couch is yours. Just make yourself at home. Thanks, J.J. I gotta make some phone calls. Good night. He may present a sacrifice of burnt offerings and if the new vessel is without blemish, he will accept it... Reflect my bear. We have to tell her, she has to understand why... The night before the exorcism... That is my bear... It's you they want... It always was. Thanks, J.J. I'm here to help. What? What the hell were you thinking, running away? Are you alright? Someone's trying to kill me. She's clearly delirious. I mean, we better call Zephyr and have them send some orderlies over to help us. It might look bad dragging her out of here like a mental patient. I can drive her myself. I'll make sure she gets to Zephyr place tonight. Where are we going? What is this, what are you doing? Roger. Hello? It's just you and me now. Uh... Hey, hey. Ugh, no. It was you. You're the guy with Noelle. So good. Oh, my god, we had sex! Yeah. It was so intense. Oh, my god, get off me! Hey. Hey. I have feelings for you. Ha. I do. What? Yeah. It was a funny story. We ran into each other in that whore's minivan. Uh! I was a nervous wreck! I just hated myself, a mess. Then I hired Conrad to knock you off. You can imagine my surprise when we found you alive and Conrad dead. It was the demon. It saved you. It saved me too. Roger... Yeah? I don't feel anything for you. How can you say that... After what I did? And that's when I realized, it's deeper than anything I ever felt for Jillian. What we have is truly special. That wasn't me. That was the demon then how do we get the demon back? There is one way... It's in there. There you go. This is it. Put it on. Put it on! You're so fucking hot. Why do you want me so bad, Roger? Fuck yeah. Same as any of those other women of the night? Tell me about the hookers, Roger. You're so much better than they are. Oh, yeah. Tell me what happened to Noelle. Tell me, Roger, and I'll give you everything you want. She didn't matter. I fucked her. I killed her. She didn't mean a thing. Take it. Well, you've proved me wrong. Well done. Thanks, Tony. What about that mark on my neck? Uh, I wouldn't worry about that now. It's just one of many scars. Will I ever know why? The possession. What brought it on? Ava, you just defeated your demon. Be happy. We don't use the "d" word. Maybe you should move in with me for a bit. I've got room now. You know, Jillian, I'm really sorry. I guess Roger had everyone fooled. You were never really fooled by him. It's my fault. I invited him into our lives. Finally, it's not my fault for once. I'm not used to being the one comforting you. You ready to pop that? I'm bill. I- I don't know exactly why I'm here, I mean, it's been a rough six weeks. It's been tough. I held up a-a 7-11 in Newark and, and here I am. And... And now I got a record, and I don't even remember doin' it. It's weird, it made me feel younger. It made me feel younger, and I miss this little fucker. Hey, Ava. Good job today. I'll, uh, see you tomorrow. Bye, captain. I'll lock up. Fucking hell. This thing that managed to get inside of you should be a real wake-up call. Mom has her own issues. They have nothing to do with you. She just thinks they do. Trust me, you don't wanna know any more. Just leave it alone. How can you possibly know what this has been like for me? I just know. Who would have thought our family would be so vulnerable to demons. Maybe it's genetic? I heard that could happen. Look what I got. To replace the one grandpa gave me. Any form of magic, no matter what the intention, can invite evil inside. You summoned the demon, you woke the darkness, you have the mark.
