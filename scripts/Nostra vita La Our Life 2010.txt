Where are the hard hats? Will you be much longer here? I need you to go to the other site. Wear those fucking hard hats. Why the fuck did I buy them? How many bloody times have I said to board this up? Its dangerous! Well? How long to finish here? - A week. - Are you kidding? I could get penalised. Six days? Five? Two hours? How long should it take? - See you! - Have a good weekend. OUR LIFE Fragile soul, who listened to me so quietly, without laughing. And now, who knows where you are? Did you find love? Or like me are you only looking for affairs because you dont want to cry any more? And life goes on... And life goes on even without us. Now were so far away from all those small emotions that united us, from all those small emotions... For Christian, the Minnen and Vika Kaj cost 10 euros... Whats that name again? - Then... - Just the last one... Vika Kaj. - Then the chest of drawers... - Vikaka! Id buy that instead of the Alba 139, so all in all we shouldnt go over - Feel here... - What is it? No, lower. - Its swollen. - While youre eating! - There must be an aphrodisiac in it. - Let me try it. Wait... - Want me to talk dirty? - Yes. - Malm, Pax... - What? - Komplement... - Whats that? - Ikea furniture. I memorised it. - You idiot. What the... Get back to your room! What are you doing here? Help! Unbelievable. - Calm down. - You have your own room! - Dont shout. - Can I sleep in my cape? - Ill help you. - No way... - Let me try. - Behave yourself. Im not handicapped. Ill just strip. - Strip! - Give me the ladder. - Youre kidding, right? - One... - Where are you going? - Two... Three. - Is that the door? - Its Ari with the kids. Not now! Wait, the rooms not finished. Its still blue and white. My kid could become a Lazio fan. Every Sundays the same. She wants to go to Mass. I pray for your sins. - Take them to Mass. - Sure... Want to go to Mass? - Yes! - See? Itll be good for them. Amen. Good, you know what to do. You stand, sit... I see youre ready to go. I sent them away. Are you counting the revs? - Porcari was looking for you. - I just saw him. He says to close the elevator shaft because it looks like a dump. But were busy upstairs. Hold on, Ill call him. - I was late. But what are you doing? - What should we do? Theres his phone! No wonder theres no answer. Shoes... - Who was he? Did you know him? - No. He was... I think he was a nightwatchman. What can I do? If I call the police theyll close the site and send us all home. Come on... What can I do? Dad, can I have some chips? - Why ask me? Mums closer. - She always says no. I see! Mum, can I have chips? No. I dont want you to eat junk. See? Mums always right, Samuel. A friend of mine has a real mini bike. Why cant I have one? - Because we dont steal. - Why not? Are you done with silly questions? Can we get ice-cream? Good idea. Im getting hungry. I have to get... I have to find an ATM. Dads going to rob a bank. Ill be right back. Lets take him out of there. Hold this. Now what do I do? A race to there! Dads going to beat you. Run, run! - Hows my little man? - Say hello to Uncle. Go, Roma! Hello, Zorro. - Im Batman. - Batman! Sorry. - How are you? - Good. - Still in your pyjamas? - Its a tracksuit. Hello. How are you? Wipe your feet before going inside. - How are you? - Good. - Still in your pyjamas. - Its a tracksuit! I brought your shirts. Washed and ironed, and the jeans too. - Great. - Here, take this. Its all here. Put your dirty laundry in here, then Ill take it with me. Hope you didnt iron the jeans? No way! What do you think? Im not Mum. - Hi, how are you? - Fine, and you? Loredana, I caught some fish for the kids. - Just off the beach here? - Yes. I see. Thats good. But I bought some nice fish. - But... - Throw it out, please. Go and get changed. Throw it outside, it stinks. I caught it this morning... - Shall I serve the kids first? - No fried food. - Why not? - They had a lot to eat. - Go on, its Sunday. - No, no fried food. - You want it? - No fried food. Why not? Dad ate it all his life and it never hurt him. Until he died of a heart attack. What does that have to do with fried food? - A bit more? - Why not? Want this? And this? You want it now? Good for you! - You too? Good boys! - Dont let Mum see you. - Its always good to be here. - Its great. Remember when Mum and Dad were here? - Its true. We had all those meals... - Its a lovely place. But next summer Id like to take the kids to Sardinia. Yeah! Hear that? The lady wants to go to Sardinia. My lady and I can afford to indulge occasionally, thank God. Youre so thin-skinned. Unlike you. Hows your salary? What are you talking about? Ive been on the dole for three months. - And not a word from the union. - That figures. - When youre self-employed... - Shes right. - Like a caretaker... - Yes, shes right. Lets hope they go back to work soon. What? - What are you talking about? - Claudio. Dont say anything about Claudio. I know him well, hes my brother. I remember when you two met he came home drenched, threw himself on the bed... - He woke you up. - Yes, he did. You know what he said? I found her. Shes unforgettable. Why are you laughing? Youre so cute! - Such a softie. - Well, I was moved. Good for you. Christian! You didnt eat anything today. Got a tummy ache? No, I wasnt hungry. - Really? - Yes. - My lovely chunky baby. - Youre hurting me. You women are born to have kids. Lets face it, working is a waste. - Big bellies... - Go! Know what I was thinking? We have to find your brother a woman. Hes getting older. - Wholl have him? Hes boring. - No, hes cute. And hes so good-looking. Hes good-looking? What about me? Youre not good-looking, youre interesting. - Interesting? - Youre attractive. Very attractive. I was serious about Sardinia. Can we go there next year? Yes, lets go. Remember how nice it was the summer before Samuel? - Just you and me... - Thats why it was nice. It was so windy... Now our third ones on the way. Wait... - What is it? - A sharp pain. I had a sharp pain. - Shall we go to the hospital? - Yes, straight there. Straight there? - Really? - Yes, hurry up. - Okay, Ill hurry. - Go. The babys coming. Theres a dickhead ahead... Squeeze my hand tight. Tighter. Mum... help... - Is he out? - Not yet. I wish! Theyre giving me the anaesthetic. So Im going to turn off the phone. The kids? Dont worry. I put them to bed. - Did they eat? - Yes, everythings fine. - Whats the matter? - That was strong... - What is it? - What do you think? Im in labour! I know. Youre making those noises... This is it. Its coming! Look how that guys dressed. All in white... look at him. Wheres he going? - Where is he going? - Nowhere. - Maybe Ill dress you like that too. - Then hell beat me up. He looks crazy. - Three, two, one... Im gone. - No, youre not. - You cant see me. - Yes, we can. Make me reappear. Three, two, one... Im back. Its coming. - Did Mum tell you his name? - Vasco. - You like it? - Yes. Ill eat you up! Sit down. Lets be quiet, were in a hospital. Are you tired, kids? - Are you tired? - Yes. Youre going to bed soon. - Is Mrs De Rosas husband here? - Yes, its me. - Hello. Im the on-duty doctor. - Hello. - Mrs Simonetta is our head nurse. - Has he been born? Could we send the children to get an ice - cream with Simonetta? No. Why? There were complications... Im sorry. Pardon? Are we keeping Vasco here? Does Mum teleport herself or fly? I thought Id take the children home with me. They cant stay here. Vasco too, of course. He just eats and sleeps. Excuse me. Look whos here! - How are you? - Fine. I havent seen you lately. You cheating on me? - Cut the crap. - Wait here. They dont even leave him alone at dinner any more. Every slut in Rome comes here to break his balls. Whats your problem? Here. Give me a kiss. Keep in touch. Youre looking good. Bye. You want a pill? You want to screw? Celeste still has her friends names. Ari... Want a hit? No way. I cant sleep at night anyway. I have to think of something, or... Now you have to think about grieving. The only thing I need to think about is money. - Only ruthless bastards make money. - Then Im a ruthless bastard. - Are you? Since when? - Since right now. What do you mean? I mean... I want a sub-contract. I want you to give me a block of flats. A sub-contract? Youve got to be joking. You think sub-contracts are peanuts? I cant do that. Maybe you dont understand. You know where I found this? In the lift well you had me close off. Who was that guy? He was a Romanian, the nightwatchman. He shouldnt have been up there. He must have been drunk, went up and fell. He even phoned me. I went over there but it was too late. An alcoholic with no skills, no family. What was I supposed to do? What do you want to do? Want to call the police? Report me? I want you to give me a leg up. Give me the sub-contract on one of the blocks. Ill do everything, not just the walls. And I thought you were grieving for Elena. - Fuck off. I think about her. - Do you? I cant help it if my kids mother was taken away from them. I cant give her back to them but I can give them everything else. What they miss and what they never had. And you, who knows where you are? Fragile soul, who listened to me so quietly, without laughing. And now, who knows where you are? Did you find love? Or like me are you only looking for affairs because you dont want to cry any more? Come on! And life goes on even without us. Now were so far away from all those small emotions that united us, from all those small emotions that were enough for us, from all those small emotions that will never return because time changes everything, you know, and we change too... This has to be ready by June. Not much time or profit but its the only one I can give you. Its enough. How do the payments work? Great. You havent a clue, have you? Youre getting in over your head. How does it work? The consortium pays in stages. The dates are essential. If I dont get the building, they dont. And you lose your 30% profit after inspection. You need at least 50,000 euros just for starters. - Do you have it? - Ill find it. Ill find it. Fifty grand. Say that again? Did I hear you? Yes, you did. I need 50,000. Okay... Thanks for the walk. Its a nice day. Im happy, Erinnas happy... - See you. - Where are you going? Come on, Ari! Should I ask the banks? Youre the only one I know whos flush. Yes, but its not my money. Im in the market. Earnings minus expenses equals profit. If everyone did like me this country would be better off. So how do the others do it? The difference is that you dont pay taxes. Listen to him! And you do? Im in the building trade. Its all a scam. - But on what I invoice... - When? Never. I said its all a scam. - Hi, Claudio. How are you? - Good. You? Okay. Hold on. Come in. - Claudios here. - Come in, were done. Thank you. - Keep in touch. - Sure. Come in. Here. - All loose in a bag, like that? - You want it in bundles? - Now I have to count it. - Ive done it. - You want me to trust you? - Then count it. - Are you happy? - Very happy. - Let your brother play with it too. - I will. - What are you looking at? - The Wii. - You like it? - Yes. Want it? - Dad will buy it for you. - Mum said it was spoiling us. Mum was right. Thats why if I buy these you two have to promise me... look at me... promise to be good, to do as I say... Okay. You give me your word? - Yes. - Look what Dads going to do. Ill give you the money and you go and buy it yourselves. - You love me? - Yes. - Yes. - More than that. - Yes. - Come here... Yes, with that. Over there. There. By yourself. Go and pay. Go on. Go. Theres your aunt. Hello, Sabrina. Youre already here? How are you? Watch your fingers. - Do we sleep at your house? - Not tonight. I bought you something. Lets see if I got it right. - You shouldnt have. - Here. - Look. - Thank you, I love it! I hope they fit. - Happy? - Yes. Give me a hand, then you go to your aunts. Listen, Claudio, theres a problem. The head of personnel called me today. They want to re-hire me. Part-time, but... - So? - Should I say no? Why? Say yes, of course. Its good news. For your husband too. I know, but what do we do with Vasco? They go to school but I cant take Vasco to work. - Hes on the bottle. - Well work it out. - He needs a babysitter, but... - Ill ask Celeste. Celeste? Are you crazy? - Whats the problem? - The problem? - Shes black? - Not that. Well? A prostitute. Youd leave your son with a prostitute? - An escort. But she quit. - So now shes just a drug dealer. So what? Hes in a wheelchair. You think its easy to get work? Hes not even on a pension. A pension for what? He used to be a thief. Christian, keep moving. Ring the bell. - Hello. Look at my little darling. - Heres our prince. Let him sleep. If he wakes up hell start to cry. Hello. Here are nappies, a bottle, talcum powder if his bottom gets red, onesies, pyjamas... This is the powdered milk he needs. Be careful, this one is the milk formula. You wouldnt take three for the price of two, would you? - Off to school, you terror. - No school for you? - The pizzas arrived. - So now Im a good guy? Ive a good mind not to give you any. If you want a drink you have to wear the hard hat. Get a move on, this isnt piecework! Arent you Muslim? - You eat chicken? - Chicken and vegetables. Mortadella no, chicken yes? Its whatever suits them. So what? Claudio, a ladys here to see you. Thats the boss. Good morning. Im looking for a nightwatchman named Mattei. - He doesnt work here. - Maybe you call him Matteo. - Is he Romanian? - Yes. Months ago he worked at the big site nearby. They told me you worked there too. - I dont... Is he your husband? - No, luckily hes not. Hes Andreis father but were not married. He hasnt seen him for a year. And Andreis doing nothing, like everyone without a father to kick their backside. - Isnt she a modern mother? - Shut up... You always play the immigrant. So you cant help me? Lets go. What the hell? Move it! What did I say? If theres anything I can do to help... I hoped to find him so he could help me with a job. - What job? - A caf on the beach. A storm ripped off half the roof. Id do it myself if I wasnt working. But right now... - Thank you. - Thats okay. - Youre very kind. - Id be happy to help. If you ever stop by our place Ill shout you breakfast. Here. - Okay? - Lungomare di Ardea... I know the place. Its nice. Come on, lets go. Dad, your hand. Still need to hold my hand at your age? Your brother doesnt. Samuel, wait for me. Go and play. Now what? Look at those monkeys of mine! Your kids? They look like you. - Your mother working you hard? - Cant you tell? Can I tell you something? - Africans are no good at roofing. - Really? They work hard, but roofs... Ever seen a roof in Africa? They live in huts. Thats why... I was telling your son this is a roofing company. I wouldnt trust those blacks too much. These people work well and theyre reasonable. Mention my name. - Thank you. - They know me as Claudietto. - Thanks. - No problem. Why dont you take Andrei to work with you? Hed love that. Andrei? I dont know... What are you doing? Stop! Look at this mess! Look at that! Why do you think I made vertical marks? I start here and finish there, to the X. Bloody hell, Andrei, I drew the lines and showed you how to do it. This way the wall will collapse. - And wear the goggles. - They make me look stupid. Bloody hell... Go get a bag of cement. Go. Go get the cement, move. One... here it is... Here it is... Come on! Three. - Im too good at these games. - Right. Why dont you let the kids win sometimes? - Why should I let them win? - We never win. It would send the wrong message. Id always let them win. Would it be good for them to think they can beat a grown-up? If they think they can win against a cheater... Whos cheating? - You took the faster car. - They have faster reflexes. And the slower car was their choice. Who said they couldnt choose the other car? - They have to learn, to get smart. - Okay. Look at him jerk off. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Are you sick? - No. Sure? Yes. Why are you sleeping the wrong way around? - Did you wet the bed? - Yes. All right. Come on, get up. Take off your pyjamas. Now youll have to sleep like that. Sorry. Here. Ill add a bit more nice sauce. - Me too. - Here you are. - He gets all of it? - Hes hungry. There. Then if youre still hungry Ill give you some more. Its in the freezer, okay? Im going out with Dad. Okay. If I do my share and work with them, what can they say? So I can keep an eye on them. I see how they work and if they take too long... I set an example, too. Im the first to get there and the last to leave. I work really hard. I can ask anything of them. You know? But I want to know how youre doing, how you feel now that youre alone. - I asked you a question. - What can I tell you? Youve been alone all your life. You tell me. - Tomorrow Ill start the second floor. - Whatever. Youre ten days behind in less than two months. Wait a minute. - Bricklayer! - Good morning. - Everything done? - Yes, all done. Did you give Samuel a banana? No. Im kidding. - The pizzetta? - Done. All done. - What about a copy of the keys? - I told you Ill do it. - Stop obsessing. - Im going out tonight. Think about your work. Its not tonight yet. Is this any time to come home? I went on a pub crawl. Why? Youve got to work tomorrow. Yesterday Coppertone said my father was nightwatchman there. He said you should know him too. Me? What is it with you, Andrei? You keep bringing up that story. I havent seen him in a year. Thank you. Youre welcome. - Andrei told you hes at my place? - Yes, thank you. And thanks for the roofing company. Ive taken care of the bill. They owed me a favour. You shouldnt have... Well, thank you. So what did you want to tell me? Could you sit down a moment? Gabriela... Hear that? Im too busy right now. Wait for me inside. Tell me everything later, okay? Yes? Okay. Follow me. Watch your step. - Have a seat. - On the sofa? Thank you. - See you later. - Ill wait for you. Good. Hi. Sorry, I dozed off. Its nice and warm. You can tell me you love me later. - No, thats not what I had in mind. - I was just kidding. Andrei told me you lost your wife a few months ago. - Thats not the reason... - Im sorry. If she was still alive we may already be doing it. But because shes gone I feel it would be disrespectful. Do you believe me? - Youre beautiful. - Yes, yes. - Do you like Italy? - Yes, I like it. But all you think about is money. It makes everything ugly. You dont like beautiful things. You only like having money. No, you also like showing people you have money. Which would you prefer? To look rich and not have a cent in the bank or have 100 billion and let everybody think youre poor? What do you mean? Why do you need money? To buy stuff. Why would you buy stuff if you cant show it off? Showing off is everything. But what about feelings? What about love? Beats me. You can buy those too. Which would you choose, me or 1000 euros? The euros, of course. - Youd choose 1000 euros? - Im kidding. - Id settle for 500. - Thats right, make fun of me. What did you do here? A parting gift from Andreis father. You know what well do one of these days? Go to my brother Pieros place. Its not far. Well bring Andrei and everyone. Well, what did you want to tell me? - Before? - Yes. It was an excuse to make love. So this is serious, youll marry me. Im not free. Sorry if Im honest. Dont be sorry. I like honesty. Whats wrong? Youre hungry. Look at Piero, how attentive he is to the guest worker. Shes no guest, shes a worker. Whatever. You know what I think? That shes looking for a meal ticket. - How do you mean? - What do you think? Hell, youre quick to judge her. - You pounced... - I pounced? If someones pouncing here, its Gabriela. It depends on the type of potato. There are new ones, white ones, yellow ones, red... And theres also... Wait, it needs oil. - Theres the Torriglia potato. - Aurelia? Not Aurelia, Torriglia. Aurelia is a road. Torriglia is a potato. How do you know all that? I read the Cooking Encyclopaedia before going to sleep. Andrei! Keep an eye on the kids, theyre belting each other. - He started it. - I dont give a shit who started it! Want to see the barbeque? This way. My dad made this. Like the rest of the house. He built it brick by brick. It was illegal at first, then it was authorised... - Look at her. - Hes talking about potatoes. From fish to potatoes. She looks at him like a St Bernard whos found a survivor in the snow. Jesus, Loredana, you want to control everything. Whats the problem? Hes too good-looking for her. Happy 55th birthday! Thank you. - Happy birthday, old man. - Thank you. Happy birthday to Uncle? - Are you 50? - Hes not 50, Christian. Dad was joking. Hes 40. And four. Gone. You dont look 40, you look younger. Congratulations. Thank you. - Doesnt he look younger? - I dont know. Be nice! Whats wrong? Speak Italian, like everyone else. I did it so they wouldnt understand. - Where are you going? - See you. Im going to Rome. - How? - Ill walk. Andrei! - Come on. - Andrei! Hi, kids. You okay? Kiss... I get it, I get it. Okay, but everyone deserves an extension. If we dont help each other... Were in the same business. This isnt the first time its happened. You know how payments work. Its only a matter of days. All right. Lets go! What are you doing playing ball? Is this recess? Its our break. We do what the fuck we want. Like hell you do! Youre taking advantage. I try to be at your level, but Ill go back to being the boss. Playing ball! You want drinks too? Hey, boss, we do lots of overtime. Working too much is against the law. - I gave you a skill. - I already had a skill! Again with the paediatrician story? That again? Youre a labourer here, do your job. I dont give a shit about your problems. You could have stayed in your country. Why the hell did you come here? Back to work. The breaks over. Want to see me cut 15 minutes? Ill make it 15 minutes shorter. Youre only good at asking for money. Im becoming the guest worker here. Bloody hell. Were the ones wholl have to run off to Romania, Morocco... All you do is make demands. I know, but its not up to me. If you dont give me 50 I cant give 30 to my source. Then they get pissed off and were hit by a tsunami. Were not going to piss them off. Everythings under control. Besides, youre not gifting me the money. Youll get it back with interest. Okay, but if I dont get it back? I have to pay for the stuff up front. Theyre already pressuring me. - Its only a month. - Its up to you. Daddys boy. Okay, thanks. - What about Vasco? - Is he a problem? Ill take him when I bring you the money. - Its security for you. - A hostage. Security. Whos here? Hello. Sitting in the dark? - Hi, Im Adrian. - Claudio. - Hi, Im Mariam. - Hello. Friends of yours? Yes. Were going out. We were waiting for you. Were late, so were off. - Did you offer them something? - Yes, they didnt want anything. - A beer or something? Dont be shy. - No, thank you very much. - Were going. Thank you. - What for? - Pleased to meet you. - The kids are fed and showered. - Thanks. Stay out of trouble! - What trouble? Leave a few girls. Where... - What are you doing? - Were playing Romanians. Playing Romanians? Get out of this room! - Were going. - Its not funny, Christian. How many times have I told you? Go. Take these things. Thats not your bed, its Mums and mine. Do I have to lock the door? I even bought you a TV. You made me wait before. Gallozzi... thats this one, 640. This is Gallozzi. Come on, Samuel, help Dad. Help Dad. Here... should take less than 4 seconds. Look whos here! The bricklayer. Roaring by night, boring by day. Look what Ive got. For you. - Seven hundred. - Here. Your first wages as a labourer! Come on! Is it all mine? You worked, you earned it. Dont spend it all. Boys! Youre a sight for sore eyes with that briefcase! The bonus should be big today. Were doing a lot of overtime. You talk too much. Doesnt your mouth ever dry up? I have to speak for the Mute too. He works like three men. Youre still ahead. Yeah, yeah. Police! Police! Fuck you. Think youre working hard? Its hard work finding you here. What a surprise. - Pizza and coffee. - You made everyone run for cover. - Theyre morons. - Why? Police, police! Come on, go in. Im smitten. You know that Im a sucker with women. I know. Ive only got one doubt. What? But you have to tell me the truth. - Did you screw her? - Ask her. Id rather ask you first. - You should ask her. - Did you do her or not? Of course. Look, Piero, its not that... She just felt sorry for me when she heard about my wife. It was an impulse... You know? - Are you sure? - Yes. See? Shes all heart. Anyway, when we were kids didnt I get your hand-me-downs? Whats that got to do with it? - Im talking about a person. - Sure, but I mean... Ari? Im with two guys who want - Didnt we agree... - Theyre gypsies. I can see you. Im here. Here. - Thanks. Ill explain later. - I dont want to know. - I hope its nothing serious. - Its okay. Itll be okay. Morning. Ill take it. Im glad you came. I was bringing him to the site. I cant take it any more. Im always scared. If its not the cops its those jerks who just left. - Hows Ari? - I dont want to see him. I dont want to live in this shit country any more. Youre making me racist against you. For three years hes been saying well leave and go to Senegal. And stupid me even had a child with him. Ari? Where the hell is he? Are you alive? Theyll be back in 24 hours to push me out of the window, wheelchair and all. Mamma mia! They scared me shitless. There was a bald guy who was a real bastard. He kept smashing things. Celeste was terrorised. She got angry at me. She packed her things and left me. - You cant trust women, or dogs. - Didnt yours defend you? No. She sold me out for a pat on the head. What will you do? One thing at a time. Ill think of something. The cop came in. He had a list of all your names. - Everyones names and surnames. - So? There are people here with no papers, no work permit. But we dont want to pay taxes so thats how it is. You know how it works. I had to hand over all the money. He cleaned me out. - Now what? - You have nothing for us? - Im broke, Pasquale. - Weve got families... - Me too. Give me a fortnight. - A fortnight? The problem isnt you, its the suppliers. You know how it is. We need to be patient. Hello? Sorry, Ill have to call you back. If you dont mind. Thanks. They want money too. Come on, boys, lets get back to work, please. Look at the duck. - Where did you get that phone? - In Mums drawer. Why dont you use your own? Hes stupid, he thinks he can talk to Mum. Give it to me. - Did Mum answer? - Dont talk like that to your brother. Watch it, or Ill give you one. Coppertone, its Claudio. Im at the site. The nightwatchman called me. You should see it. Its raining through the roof. The attics flooded. Hurry up with those braces. Its all coming down. Put those outside. These have to go on the roof. This way! Get those props up. Its going to cave in, damn it! Up with those braces! Come on! Get the plastic on! This goes up. Give me a hand! Hey, boss, were you scared? Well... Its okay. Ive never seen sheeting done like that before. Never. No use complaining now. You should have checked. Then if youd seen something wrong you could have told me or done something about it. Its my building, but you wanted it. I let you have it. Now you have to do the work, and do it well. Look at this mess. Its hard to look at. I take responsibility for my work. Well, since were short of time, lets pretend it didnt rain. The roofs fine, you didnt call me, nothing happened. Finish and deliver. How can I deliver a new house with a leaky roof? - So now you want to be honest. - You kidding? A wall can collapse... So now you remember to be honest? Right now? Do you remember why youre here? Is it because youre qualified? Think I dont dream every night about that poor devil down there? You and I are bound together in this. I know, were together in this. Theres only one thing to do. First of all, stay calm. - First... - Of course. Then well see whats needed. Itll take five or six weeks. I cant give you six weeks. Delivery dates have to be met. Double the shifts, get more workers, I dont care. I cant give you six weeks. - I havent paid them in a month. - Then lie. I cant help. Its not up to me, its the Consortiums schedule. Okay? Got something to say? How can I make it? I mean, do you have something to say to me? So you know what I thought? - That youd pay us at last. - Wait, hold on a minute. Im going to make you all partners. Ill give 2% to each of you. No. Two percent of zero is zero. Its not zero, its an investment. Its like a bank. No more talk. Got the money? You havent paid us in two months. The moneys there. But this is different, like a bank. - You invest money then... - What money? - Yes, I have the money. - Hand it over. - Whats this? - What are you giving us? Its an advance. If we become partners... No advance! Well do this thing together. Thats all I have. I said well be partners. Forget it. Well take our tools and leave. Where are you going? Its not enough. Give me my money! - Give me my money! - Get your hands off me. You stay out of this. Leave those two poofters! What are you doing? Where are you going with that? Give me back my drill! Arseholes! Coppertone... Coppertone, I was at your sons baptism. I told you, it was a circumcision! Anyway Jamal needs this. Where do you think youre going? Go ahead, leave! Youll all come crawling back. One by one youll be back. I dragged you out from under bridges. Dont worry, itll be okay. Itll blow over. Are the kids there? Did you leave Vasco outside? Come on. Dad, can you do this? What? Here. Dad, do this. This? Were going home now. Whats wrong? Whats the matter? Theyre the ones boosting my morale. Im a shit father. A lot better than mine. Andrei... You know where your father is? I worked with him. One morning they called me, hed fallen. They found him in the elevator shaft. He was dead. What are you talking about? I buried him. He was illegal, theyd have closed the site. I didnt even report it. Why not? Because thats how life goes. Is that so? Under a slab in a cemetery or there, whats the difference? Theyll make a playground, theres already a family or two... Lifes returning there. You said you were better off with him gone. A father like that... - Where are you going? - Fuck off! What are you doing? Sit up. I got some cash, in case you need it right now. - Where did you get it? - Where? The Ministry breaks my balls, so I pulled a heist. Isnt it too much sacrifice? He got a salary advance. He wont notice the monthly cut. Well, I will feel the difference, but... Anyway... - Are you sure? - Dont worry. I wired your account, the money should be there. And I thought you could use these. - What are those? - They were Mums. Not her gold pounds. Go on, take it. Its time to start living. Forget the memories. So now... Ill get back on my feet. Little by little... - Were here. - Were always here. Youll get it all back. You bet we will. Were not a charity. Come on... Come on! Come on! Right? What a lousy end, eh? - What are you talking about? - What end? Are you nuts? What end? Youre a rock. Come on. Well always be here. Why isnt Andrei with us any more? Because he doesnt want to. We talked about that. - May I? - Come in. Hello, Claudio. You remember where I live? To what do I owe the honour? Nothing. Our discussion the other day... Im sorry. And Im sorry about what happened with the workers. Really. - Staying for dinner? - It depends. Whats cooking? Pasta and soft cheese. The house special. Can you make me linguini? - Sure. - All right. I wanted to have a talk with you. Forget whats done. It could get worse if you keep going. Ill sort it. Im still due a payment. Take my advice, stop now. Declare bankruptcy and dont pay workers or suppliers, just close down. Good idea. Then youll finish the building. What if I do? Should it stay half-finished and become a squat for gypsies and the homeless? Dont you want to see it finished? You started it. Thats right. I started it, and Ill finish it. - Pass me your plate. - How can you do it? There are only weeks left, you have no workers, no money. How? Does Frosinone ring a bell? Then youll really get hurt. Theyre piece workers, so you may finish on time. But do you know the cost? Three times as much. Heres the estimate. Its all there, everything you need to know. We need your permission to stay here. We have to sleep here. We work 24 hours a day. Unlicensed. Not interested in unions. - I see. - But dont you dare cross us. Youd have us and the unions both against you. - You think its expensive? - Bloody expensive. But look at the quality you get. If youre okay with it, a handshake is enough. Its not that... Lets shake on it. Guys! Come on, he accepted! Look, I even brought my aunt. Shell cook for us. She cooks for me and my five brothers. - A whole crew. - Sure. No invoices, nothing. We dont declare the work, were honest. Theyve taken sick leave to make your dream come true. - But Ill be left with nothing. - No, you wont. Youll have 10% left. Look at them. Nice, arent they? All Italians. They work twice as hard. Forget the guest workers. Look at that. Unload everything, boys. - Was this coffee yours? - No. Whose coffee was it? - Was this coffee for you? - Yes, thanks. Ill be down in an hour! Is that your son? - Hes cute. - All by himself. - How old is he? - Not yet one. - Hes big. - Hes already walking. Hes quick. Hes a quick one. SALES OFFICE - Aunties little darling. - Go to Auntie. The moment has come. Thanks again. Really, thank you. Ive added a little something as the wedding gift I never gave you. It was only 16 years ago. But I remembered it. When you can... - Take the kids away, please. - Thanks for the present. Do you feed these kids? Theyre skinny. You look good in heels. See? High heels are like relatives. Theyre a pain, but they help. - Hello, Uncle. - Are you dressed as a bride? - As a dancer. - Are they lizards? Theyre snakes! Next is the Rainbow Ballet School. Theyre getting ready now... Heres the Rainbow Dance School to perform at our summer show. Here. - What is it? - Ive paid off everything. Wait. I got Mums pounds back from the pawn shop. - Really? - I got them back. Im left without a cent, but... Ill have to start over. I knew youd make it. I know you. Nothing moving for you over there? Where? - I know you too. - What do you mean? You still havent told her you like her, have you? - What should I do? - Theres nothing to it. A caress, a cuddle... Go on. What, right here? Its not appropriate. I get it. Ill leave, so you wont be embarrassed. You cant get any food yet. You have to sit through the whole torture first. Right, madam? Cant touch anything. Go on, crack a smile. Are you still mad at me? Of course. And look what an idiot I am. Im paying all your back wages even though you told me to fuck off. You dont need to thank me, its work. Whats your problem? I dont even know myself. If I did, I couldnt explain it. If I could explain it, you wouldnt understand. So... Anyway... I want to take the kids to Rimini this summer. Its a great place. I wondered if youd like to come. Wed be a team. Actually Ive got a job at a building site this summer. On my way to work I go by the cemetery. - Your wifes there, right? - Yes. I never go there, because... I dont even take the kids. So you dont go, dont take the kids, never talk about her. You just talk about money. You think money can fix everything. - What do you want? - Thats not how it works. You cant fix me. How do you fix your wifes death? Dads cutie pie! Ready for the building site? Why so quiet? You woke me up, Im not used to it. - What are you doing? - Were concentrating. - Concentrating? - Yes. On a person. I had an idea. If we close our eyes and hold hands tight, maybe a person whos gone could come back. A person whos gone? Someone weve known a long time. Really? Will you do it with us? Sure. How do you do it? We have to close our eyes and hold hands tight. Lets think very hard. Then maybe the person will come back. Dad, the electricity went out. Really? It worked! Well? I have good news. Someones come back. - Who? - Guess. Show your face. Surprise! Hi, gorgeous! - How are you? - Fine. - Good to see you. - How are you? Hello, kids. - She couldnt stay away from me. - How could I leave him alone? It seemed a half-hearted knock. He was so bored, his last girlfriend just left. Dont listen to him. This morning a travel agent brought this for you. Elena was supposed to pick it up, but she didnt. They apologised for keeping it this long. Sardinia. We wanted to go to Sardinia all together. She bought the tickets early because it was cheaper. Come on, lets go shopping. Need anything? Fruit and vegetables, pasta... - No, thanks. - For the kids? - Youre sure? - Lets go. Im glad youre back, Celeste. Thank you. Bye. Vasco... come with Dad. - Where? - Well go for a nap. Lets all go take a nap. Come on, Christian. Well have a nice rest. Right, Vasco? - Leaving me alone with Vasco? - Thats your bed. - Can we come in your bed? - Sure. What are you waiting for? Here they are! Here we are, all together. Come and cuddle up to me. You have to keep me warm. Come here, Christian. I thought we had to sleep. You have to love me. Why dont you say you love us? Do I have to say it? I do love you. Lets all squash together. Careful, well turn Vasco into jam! OUR LIFE
