It went well, I guess, you know. They guy was like 60 years old so it's not like we, you know it's not like we had friends in common or something it was an interview. Do you know if he liked you? I don't know if he liked me. It's not like he was looking for a new best friend he was looking for someone to do the job. Someone who's competent, so, that's what I was trying to be. Trying to be? Honestly I don't want to talk about it anymore. There's really nothing else to say. It went fine. Okay? Okay You hungry? You want me to fix you a snack? Sure. I don't see much. There isn't. I could make you a PB and J. You want me to make you one? I guess so. Okay. Is that what you call a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? A PB and J? Yup. Why? Did the mail come?

Yeah uh, I don't want to get the peanut butter in the jelly jar. Okay? Well - Don't start with me. Okay. What is the matter. I mean you're going to get the sandwich and it's going to taste the same. What's the problem Peter? There is no problem Vandy. Like it's my fault. You know what the problem is. The problem is that only a fucking moron would use two knives to make a PB and J? Who do you think - give me the knife. Peter - I'm not going to kill you Vandy just give me the knife. Fine I'll use your other one. Now watch. First what you do is you spread the PB, okay. Now you see this excess PB on the knife? You wipe it on the other slice of bread. Okay? See that peanut butter shit stain? That means the knife is now clean and ready for the J, okay? Fuckface! Maybe if you shut up and stopped being such a fucking psychopath you might learn something. You are a fucking asshole! Oh yeah it's always me being the asshole isn't it? Why don't you try taking responsibility for your own stupid shit. I don't like doing it that way! The knife is never clean enough! Okay, Fuckface! Why don't you go fuck yourself. This bread is soft. So it will always make the knife clean! Unless, you're a fucking ape, and don't know how to do anything. Don't take it out on me because you choked in your interview.

I'm not that person with you. I think I used to be like that with you but you've been trying to kill it ever since. It's like you're trying to kill me. I'm not trying to kill you Peter. Not literally it's just me, who I am. Ever since the day we met it's like, I mean that's exactly what it feels like to me. And it's not just you I mean I'm sure I do it too but I need to be able to feel me. I feel like I've been asleep. A couple weeks ago remember that you were acting really nice to me and genuinely and I felt uncomfortable. Like I was outside of my comfort zone with you being loving towards me. It made me feel horrible. I didn't want it to be like this. I didn't want it to be like this either. Don't ever leave me. Don't ever leave me. I'm not going to leave you. Peter. Yeah? Is there someone else? Is there someone else? It wasn't anything Oh my god! Vandy Oh my god! No, no. Listen it was nothing. Don't you, don't you fucking touch me! Vandy, calm down Holy shit Listen to me. The problems that we have are between us. Nothing happened! Shit I knew it. Don't do this okay we got so far last night because I didn't bring it up. Let's just talk about it. Get the fuck out oh my god get out of here. Like we talked about it last night! No, no, no, no. Just get out of here get the fuck out. Please don't do this. Back up! Get Get out! Alright. Okay here's a question for you. The crossword puzzle. You said you finished it. I did. What day of the week was it? It was a Saturday. Oh that's the toughest one, right? Yeah. My mom always does crossword puzzles so I've been doing them forever. I am impressed. Yeah no, yeah it's a really productive way of spending your time. Do you do crossword puzzles or. No, that's good, so we don't have to fight over them. So I hope you didn't have to change your schedule around too much to uh. To what? For dinner. A little bit. Yeah. I just meant uh, nothing really. You mean did I tell the guy I'm seeing? No, well no that's not what I. That's not what I was expecting you to say. I guess I was saying more like did you have a date that you had to break off with him or. I really was trying not to talk about this more than anything, and here I am just talking about it. Okay. I'm sorry. No it's okay. Sorry but you said you changed your plans a little bit, though Do you want to be talking about it or. I guess I do..? Um, well I was supposed to meet up with him later but instead I broke up with him. Oh, wow. Are you regretting that yet? Yeah. No. I wasn't thrilled with the way things were going with him anyway. No, well, of course - I'm sorry I wasn't implying that you did it because of me. That's okay. And it really wasn't that nasty a break up. So if this date goes really badly I think I still have a shot of getting back together with him. Good one. Thanks. Sorry I brought all this up. It's stupid I'm sorry. No why do you always.. What? It's nothing. No tell me please. Well you apologize a lot. Do I? Little bit. Sorry about that. I'm kidding. No I know what you mean. I'm not saying it like it's a problem. No it's fine trust me it's something that I'm aware of. I feel like a jerkoff when I do it. No that's not what I meant. No. It's fine. I mean it. You know what I think it is actually? Tell me what you think because I'm not, I'm not too sure myself but, no I think I apologize a lot when I'm. Not really sorry? That too. Yeah. I no, I wasn't trying to turn this into a nitpick session. I don't know Jesus even on our first date. No please are you kidding me? This is exactly what I'm this is the kind of stuff I would always want you to tell me if we were, um, no I'm glad you said it. Seriously. Like I said I like to knock it off so. Not a problem, honestly, bring it on! I am really glad I'm here with you. So am I. No. Nuhuh. I insist. I have it. Give me a break. You got me a present. The crossword puzzle? Yeah. You do realize that the New York Times is $1? Yeah but you had to get two. Oh. You're right. It was a $2 gift. Would it make you feel better if you left the tip? Fine. Okay. You take care of the tip. You're terrific. What do you think it was about? Paul is a very good tipper. No seriously. Vandy, they've always been like that from day one. They can't stay together like that. All Paul wanted to do was tip the guy. Yeah you're not really supposed to tip at these things. She's right actually. Are you serious? Yeah. You're an idiot. You're an idiot. What's it like being the less intelligent person in the relationship? Good one. Seriously. Fuck off. Maybe you and Keith should form a support group. You know I am starving. Do you mind if we just go home and you can make me a nice peanut butter and jelly sandwich. No because I just ran the dishwasher so there should be enough silverware for you. Would you like to dance with me? Have they always been like that? They fought at their own wedding. Like we just saw? Maybe worse. Jesus. Why are they together? Does Paul talk to you about this stuff? No. That is so annoying to me. Can I tell you something you promise you won't tell anyone? I promise. Promise you won't tell. Oh my god just fucking tell me. There was this one time where Paul told me that he was gonna leave her. Shut up. What did you say? I told him not too. Really? Yeah. Why? I don't know. I can't believe you never told me that. Yeah. I mean jeeze what the hell do we have to talk about you don't tell me that story? He told me not to say anything. So what you tell me anyway. I know. God that is so juicy. Seriously why didn't you tell me that? I would have told you it just happened during last year. Yeah. I just mean it happened during winter. Oh. I love you. Whatever. Come on. You come on. I'm sorry. So you and Paul you have a lot in common huh. What do you mean? Is Paul seeing someone else? I don't believe so. Oh that wasn't why you wanted to leave her then. No. Well you're so good at it maybe you should have given him some of your tips on breaking up with people. I made a huge mistake I'm sorry. I still - I'm sorry. I don't want to hear you apologize. Well I don't have any tips because I've never broken up with anyone. Really? It's hard to believe isn't? Well I know a stud like you. But I mean it. Seriously though. Oh yeah. Honest to God. You are pushing it. I had a couple girlfriends in high school and college and they all just fizzled out there were no actual break ups. You're gonna keep going. And then I got dumped once or twice. Then I met you. And here we are. Here we are. Here we are. Are there any other things you have to do to get ready for your trip? We could just take it slow try to work through things. I'm sorry. You told me to stop apologizing. I don't know why I keep doing it. I'm not acting like myself. Peter. Yeah? Everything that happened with us happened for a reason. This is who we are together. We're just going to stay the same way it's not going to be any different. Yeah I know. I understand what you're saying. I understand you. This is what I want. You are the person that I have to be with. Do you feel the same way? Where are my pants? Oh no, I'll do it. Sorry. It's okay. We should uh, see if Highheeled Shoes is still playing. Okay, that sounds great. I'm joking. Oh. You don't remember saying that you'd rather have your scrotum nailed to a chair. You can see whatever movie you want, is my point. I'm aware of that. No I know you are I'm just saying that whatever you're into that's fine with me. No I just remember you saying that and I thought it was funny Right. Right. Yeah. Well there's like five movies playing at the big theater in about three hours why don't we just go there then and pick on. Okay. Maybe we could go have brunch like an hour before the movie starts. You'll be hungry by then right? I'll be fine but you haven't eaten. Oh I'm fine I'm not that hungry. Peter you're always hungry. And you won't get your meal for a couple hours. It's fine. I can wait. I'm fine. You don't have to. You just ate. I'm really not that hungry. Peter. What? I'm trying too hard It's okay. Okay. Do you want me to make you some scrambled eggs? No I'm not hungry. How bout a toasted pita with cheese?
