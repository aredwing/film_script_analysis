What are you going to do? And if you surrender Maybe you'll get it back And if you surrender Maybe Well, I'm not sure what it's for But it's tattooed, tattooed on my life Oh, yeah And I'm not sure what it's for But it's tattooed on my life Well, maybe I've been waiting for something Waiting on the corner With a copy of the Enquirer Oh, boy, I read the news today Same news as yesterday And if you surrender Maybe you'll get it back And if you surrender Maybe Well, I'm not sure what it's for But it's tattooed, tattooed on my life And I'm not sure what it's for But it's tattooed on my life Scotty Miller. Sheriff. I haven't seen you on this side of Harborford for quite a while. I kind of preferred it that way. I was just visiting. Uh-huh. Haven't you disappointed her enough for one lifetime? You know, Scotty, I take a personal interest in my niece's well-being, and you of all people should know how important family is. Is there something I can do for you? Go home, son. Scott. Jess. Two years. Wow. Yeah, I heard you were in town. My parents bought a new boat in California, sailing it back for their 25th anniversary, and I'm the house-sitter. School's good? Yeah. I was sorry to hear about your dad passing. Did you get my, uh- Letter. Yeah. How's your mom? California. New husband. What is that now, the third? Well... Yeah... Bye. Bye. Scott- Yeah? Look, it's freezing out. Do you want something hot before you go? You sure? Yes, I'm sure. Deja vu. My mom keeps it untouched. It's weird. I can't believe you're still in Harborford. You always wanted to leave so bad. Rub it in. I was all set to do the big move, and then my dad got sick- No way! Didn't I make you that bracelet? - Of course. - It's so bad. It's cute. What the hell? How many summer days did we totally waste up here? We were awful. I was a bad influence. Scott, I'm sorry I stopped calling, - My parents, and then school. - It's all right. Don't worry about it. I understand. I do, and your parents were right. How was it for you? Not that bad. Eight months, three squares a day. More than I could count on at home most of the time, right? Yeah. Anyway, it's ancient history now. Really cleaned up. Honest, you'd hardly recognize me. Yeah, right. I'm in college, here at Sherwood, on the hockey team, until the end of the semester at least. Then I'm out of here. What do you mean? I'm leaving this place. - For good. - Where are you going? I don't know. California, maybe. Just gotta go. Are you seeing anybody? No. Wow, what's her name? Lydia. It's nothing serious. Why not? Half the time, I'm crazy about her. Half the time, I just want to kill her. - How about you? - Well, no one in particular. I'd better get going. Yeah, we hit the ice in an hour. You should come by, though. We'll grab a coffee and a claw over at Fred's later. Well, won't you be seeing Lydia tonight? It's girls' night, and she's going out. Okay. If you just joined us, it's top of the ninth, two outs with nobody on, and one out away- Hey, Josh, you want a beer? This will fix his stomach. Josh? What the- What the fuck! At the blue line! Whoa! This way! This way! What the hell? C'mon! Let's do something about this! Come on! Hey, come on! Oh, my God. What are you doing here? You are so bad. Come on, let's go! Do it! Oh! Take it easy! What is this thing you're wearing? Hey! Aah! Psycho! Don't ever call me! Aah! Hey. What are you doing back here? Um, I had to use the restroom. It's back there. So you guys lost. Huh. I'm surprised you noticed. Hey. Who's this? Lydia, this is Jesse, an old friend. Oh, you mean old buddy, don't you? Hey. Scott, you didn't have to lie to me. I wouldn't have been threatened by an old girlfriend. Oh, no. Jesse and I were never- I just want there to only be truth between us. I'd better get going, so- No, please, don't. Will you excuse us for a moment? Lydia... Truth, huh? Tell me who this belongs to. Okay. I didn't want to tell you about him. He's been obsessed with me since last year. I mean, he showed up tonight, and I tried to talk to him, but he got weird, so I left. That's all. Come on. I'm sorry. Will you ever forgive me, kind sir? Lydia, come on. You're going to make me pay for this, aren't you? Remember, we're going out tonight. - What? - I'll be ready by 8. I guess I must have- Forgotten, yeah. You still want to grab that coffee? I should get going. Fun game, though. Old friend? We'll see about that. Hi, leave a message and I'll call you back... maybe. I'm at your window. I can see you're home. You up there with your fire chief? I'm not doing this anymore. We're done. I'm out. Oh! Ah! Get lost, crazy broad! Idiot. Aah! It's funny. I thought I'd be more pissed. But it's like you let me off the hook. I'm talking to you, Lydia! Lydia? Oh shit! What happened? Did you get him back for last time? Huh? Ah, don't worry about it. Hey, Ty. - Go ahead. - We've got a serious problem down at Star Club on second. We need you to get down there quick. I'm on my way. Where are you going? I don't know. Just gotta go. Uh. What happened? Were you in a fight? Jesse. I thought maybe you were done with all that. Look, I am. This isn't what you think. Then what is it? You should go home. Your uncle, he's going to be looking for me. I'll get you some of my dad's things to wear. Thanks. In the morning- you need to go. She was one of my best friends. I'm very sorry. Thank you. Sam. You're sure it was Scott Miller they saw running out of here? Hello? Jess? Uncle Ty. Is everything okay? I'm fine. Have you seen Scotty Miller tonight? No, I haven't seen him since this afternoon. Why, what happened? Nothing, sweetheart. You just go back to sleep. - Scott. - Oh, thank God. What's the matter with you? It's a nightmare. Look, Jesse. Jesse. Look, all that matters is you're okay. I mean, if anything happened to you, I- And another puzzling death in Harborford. The victim has been identified as Lydia Mason, a student at Sherwood College in Harborford. Mason's attacker is as of yet unidentified. Local sheriff Ty Durst was tight-lipped at the scene this morning. The investigation is underway. We have a few eyewitnesses and a suspect. And that's all I've got to say. That's all I've- Anything else? No, I can't. Yeah, I'll hold. Come on. Step aside. Come on. Jess, I know how this looks. - Were you there? - I was. You've got to let me explain, though. I saw him, the fireman at the arena. Hi, this is Jesse Jarrett. I'd like to talk to Sheriff Durst right away, please. I didn't hurt her. She just disintegrated in front of me. Her eyes were almost black, full of blood. You need help. She must have caught it from him. It could be some kind of disease or a poison. Look, I'm going to figure this out. - I just need some time. - Please hurry. Okay, Jesse, you know me better than anyone. If I had done this thing, would I still be here? Hello? Ty? Jesse? I'm at your front door. Jesse, you all right? I'm fine. Good, good. You see the news? Scotty Miller's in serious trouble, sweetheart. Do you know where he is? Jess? You feeling okay? - Scott- - I know, I know. I know, sweetheart. Just... relax, okay? Just hold on. Let's go sit down, sweetheart. Okay? Sweetheart, I don't think you understand the level of depravity in the Miller family. Now, your great-uncle Cyrus, he busted the first Miller bootlegging operation right off of this coast. Scott's old man Lucky? Well, he's just as bad. And now... looks like Scott's the worst of the bunch. I can't believe you lied to me, Jesse. You're wrong about him. I know Scott. Wrong? That kid's taken this whole town for a ride, made a damn mockery out of me! Jesse. Scott's conviction two years ago, it was his old man moving the hot car parts we found on the property. It was going to be his third count, and he was looking at But presto. Scott confesses, takes the fall for his old man. Scott went to prison in his dad's place? You see what I'm saying, sweetheart? They're all the same trash. Yeah? Well, what kind of situation? Just slow down. What? Yeah, okay. I'll be right there. We're not done. Where'd he go? What the... Hey! Okay. Hold it right there! I said stop! Stay back! I'm warning you! Sam, go get an ambulance. What the hell's happening in this town? The church fire was the last mission he was on. Yo. No shit. What channel? This adds to the bizarre occurrences taking place this week in Harborford. That must be the psycho that killed Josh. ...that is attacking the people of Harborford. Sheriff Durst has given us very little information to go on. He has told us that he has a suspect in mind. He has not, as of yet, given us a name nor description of the suspect, which only adds to the feeling of fear in the community. That's it, dude. I am done for the day. Mom, he shouldn't have called you. No, Scott's not here right now. He was. Look- You don't know that. No, stay there. Okay. I'll call you later. You climbed inside a big balloon And I watched you wave goodbye You said it'd only be awhile - Half the time, I just want to kill her. - It seemed - like such a lie - Your uncle, he's going to be looking for me. - I believe - I mean, if anything - It now - happened to you, I'd- I believe it now Hey, yay, yay, yeah Late developments regarding the shooting today at Sherwood Mall in Harborford. The dead man has been identified as Mr. Darrell Johanson, a Harborford roofer. Mr. Johanson went on a rampage earlier today, attacking shoppers in the mall before being gunned down by police. It was horrible. His face was falling off, and his eyes, it was as if they were full of blood. Reporting to you live from Harborford- Full of blood? ... this is Susan Fox. Jesse? You didn't run. - What? - You didn't run. It's what you'd always do when we were kids and you got in trouble. You'd run away, be gone for days. I got pretty close, believe me. I don't know you got yourself into this, but you're going to need my help to get out of it. Where are you? Scott? You need my help. How do you plan on helping me, Jesse? - You'd better keep your distance. - No. It's not a virus. - How do you know? - It would have spread... through town by now. Go. Lydia's fireman was on a call here. The fireman got it first. He gave it to Lydia, she gave it to the guy at the mall. If the game was at three, and Lydia died at nine, that's six hours. What's that? Oh! Don't get too close. Smells like vinegar. We have to get down there. Over there. That's where the axe was. Here. I see something. Careful. Okay, here goes. "This vessel bears a corrigia "born of hellfire. Preserve this vessel, sealed from the world-" I can't read the rest. It's dated the 4th of May, 1871. We've got a date and a name. I can look through the town's archives. Maybe there's something there. We need to find that guy your uncle dusted at the mall. If this "corgeria" thing has moved on, we need to find out who. Come on, huh? One shot. Clear the frame. Huh? Come on. I'm begging you. I'll give you 20 bucks. Flatfoot! Yeah. You have a nice day, too, sir. Okay. The last person with the guy from the mall was his ambulance technician Eddie Pastor. He left his shift early. He's a boarder, and they say that we can find him at one of the skate parks. Can I have the chips? Whoa! You want these chips? Not so fast. You're the guy that can do the backside air, right? I can't right now. Hungry. The backside air first. Okay, we're back at the church. I'll meet you here after. - Jesse. - Yeah? Thanks. For what? Believing me. No psychotic killer could make anything this goofy. "Edward Norberg, a Harborford native "and a respected silversmith, "was struck down by a bolt of lightning "Tuesday night in what many consider to be "an act of divine intervention. The madman was survived by a wife and son. " Hey. Is that... Is that Eddie? Yo, we didn't do this. I didn't say you did. Is that him? This jack attacked me, and dropped dead. How? How'd he attack you? Listen, you should come with me. I think you might be sick or cursed, maybe. I just told you, we didn't do this. It's called the corrigia. Are you deaf, fuck head? 'Cause I just told you- You don't understand. If you don't get to a doctor now, you might not make it through the night. Come on. Come on, Scott. Who is it? Miss Norberg? My name is Jesse Jarret. I'm looking for information on Edward Norberg. I tried calling the listed number. - They said it was out of service. - Stay right there. ...but that's not to say that people haven't put their own quarantine in effect. People are staying in their houses. People aren't going to work. Children aren't going to school. They have really isolated themselves in hopes of- Took you long enough. Just the man I've been looking for. Ty, same as the others. I've been warning them for years. Who are you with? FBI? - CIA? - Uh... Mrs. Norberg... Show me your identification. Oh. - Miss Norberg... - No one ever listened, but now they will. Now they will. Could you tell me anything about what happened in 1871? The scourge, dear. La corrigia. My great-grandfather, Edward, was falsely blamed for the deaths in 1871. He devoted his whole life to clearing his name. His search took him around the world. But Edward died, hit by lightning. No one got it out of them in time. But they had to explain the murders away, so he was reported dead, whisked out of the country, and warned never to return. Who is they? They. When he died, all his possessions were sent here from the Far East. Everything is in the coach house. It's all there. Go ahead. I'm telling you, you gotta find the skater girl. She's next. How does she tie in with Lydia, Dennis, and the fireman? I never met her before tonight. I already told you. What about the freak at the mall? What's he got to do with this? - You're on the wrong track. - How are you killing these people, boy? I'm not! What is it? Some kind of freaking chemical agent or whatnot? Who'd you buy it from? - Just listen. - You were placed at both murder sites. The fireman and your girl had been getting it on for months, so you had plenty of motive. And last but not least, right there. So how 'bout a confession so you have something, however futile, going for your sorry ass? Find the girl. Okay. All right, smart ass, we're gonna do it your way. Sam, take him down to the station. I'm gonna give the news to the press. Hey, Chris. Let's go. Hands off, Porky. What the hell are you looking at? Get used to it, Miller. That goddamned sheriff arrested some boy for the murders. You've got to get down there and straighten it out. You're Lucky Miller's kid. Yeah. I know your old man. Where is that fother mucker? Dead, six months. - Cancer. - Old Lucky. Dumb shit. Always was a loser. No offense. None taken. Tries to go straight, then croaks. - Sorry ass. - What? He should of known Ty'd never let him just stop the monthly. Monthly? Durst? Everyone in town's gotta pay the kindly sheriff. Try saying no, and he'll set you up on some trumped-up charge. That's what he did to your old man. Are you saying the car parts he found on my dad's property were- Planted. You bet. Fortune never smiled on your old man. That's why they called him Lucky. So listen to this. I'm minding my own business, grabbing a taco on First, down by the Foundry, and this skinny chick comes up to me. She's wearing those hip-hop pants. I hate the look. But I see she's got this slamming rack, so I'm friendly. I take her for a spin on my bike. She's got her hands all over me. So I pull over on the We're gonna do it there, on the bridge. She gets to her knees, pulls up my shirt. Next thing I know, this bitch is puking her guts out. I mean her guts. Blood, stomach shit, all over the sidewalk. It was fucked up. When was this? No, wait, you gotta hear the rest of this. She's grabbing at me like she's gonna freaking die, right there. I'm like, whoa, bitch. But she keeps coming. So I push her ass away from me, and she goes right over the edge, splat. She's on the highway and these semis are making mincemeat of this chick. It was fucked up. Shit, you got something to eat, kid? - Sheriff! - What's your problem? Sheriff Durst! Hey. Shut the hell up. Stay back- Sheriff! What the hell is your problem, Miller? This guy's infected. - Everybody knows that. - Funny. He's got it. You gotta let me out of here. Get your hands off me, Miller. - Stay away from me. - What the... Oh, Jesus. Let me out. Shit. Now look what you've gone and done. Come on, put your hands through the bars. Holy shit. Miller, get this guy off me. Come on, don't just stand there. What the hell happened here, Miller? I think I need to kill you, Sheriff. Just calm down, son. Hey, whoa. The hell's gotten into you? It's in you. There's nothing wrong with me, boy. - Put that gun down. - I'm sorry. You're no killer, Scotty. You said so yourself. You don't understand. You're not gonna shoot anybody. Like father, like son. You pussy. Help me. Miller! Come on, come on, go. Get the son of a bitch. Got the keys? Yeah, I'll drive. I'll drive. Get in the damn car. I want to know the point as soon as you get there, fellas. - What? - This is yours. Well, that's nice, Sam. Now go get the damn car! I want the south end and the north end blocked off. I repeat, the north and south end blocked off. Sam, come on! Go, go. Christ. What happened back there? Just drive. All right, we've barred him in the alley between Bell and Third. I'll be right there. Take no chances, boys. You see him, shoot to kill. I repeat, take no chances with this guy. Turn this heap around, Sam. Where are those doughnuts? Ah, yeah. I want the south end blocked off, Sam. Right here. Go, go, go, go, go! On the ground, Miller. - You don't have time, Sheriff. - He said on the ground. It's inside him. Can't you see? He needs help. Now! Don't give me any more reason than I already have, son. How could you? How could you do it? Do what? He was sick, and you knew it. You still blackmailed him. You had to see him suffer, didn't you? What's he talking about, Ty? You and your daddy thought you could make a fool out of me, didn't ya? Ty, what the hell? Shut up, Sam! Well, now, it looks like we have a real unpleasant situation here. Fortunately, no one's gonna miss a murdering delinquent from Harborford. Don't bet on it, Sheriff. Jesse? I can't believe you, Uncle Ty. How could you? You are a disgrace. Jesse, you put that Taser down. I'm not playing with you, girl. I'm warning you. Sam. You have no idea the shit storm you are now in, young lady. - Stop! - Jesse, relax. Sam, now! She has nothing to do with it. I'm the one you're after. Shut up! Oh, my God. Jesus, Mary- Sheriff? - Stay away from him. - Down on the ground! Now! It's gonna want to move. Ty? Buddy? Shoot it. Shoot it. Stop, Ty, stop! He's gone! Okay, let's j-jus-just- just calm down. Holy Jehosaphat. I have never, in my entire life, seen anything that comes close- Is he- Is the sheriff dead? Where'd it come from? Nobody knows. Well, how do you kill it? I don't know. Great. Wait. Do it! Punch it. Oh, no. Aah! Fire. We need fire. Glove box. Flares. Come here, you. We gotta get you out of here. The doctors that I've spoken to have confirmed that this is possible. It could be a virus, that a virus could do that to these bodies, mutilate them in a way that is But that's not to say that that's what's for sure this is. This is a grimoire, from 1766. A what? It's a demonologist handbook. The Church spent centuries collecting information from what they thought was demonic activity. These books have everything, from weather portents to demonic possessions and exorcisms. Who would use them? The practitioners of goetic magic. They were sort of demonic exterminators that the Church kept on staff. This is what Edward Norberg was convinced attacked him. "Corrigia. "Latin origin of the word 'scourge. ' "The creature's quest to procreate is without equal. "It will consume the innards "of as many as 6 to 9 human, before reaching a size, allowing it to self-propagate. " I'll be back to take your order. Wow. I'm sorry. She just might have recognized you. That's better. Coming through! Press! Make way, boys. Oh, what have we got here? Oh, nice. I'm making a living, bub. Those are the remains of a friend of mine. Oh. Oh. Who was it? That was Sheriff Ty Durst, a legend in this town. He was killed while in pursuit of a murder suspect. That is a terrible shame. I appreciate your cooperation. Oh, hey, you got it, Officer. Well, keep it together. - Is this for real? - These things infested parts of the Old World. They used electricity to get it out of people. The Taser gun. You're genius. Well, it took you long enough to notice. This shows how to capture it. "The scourge has few weaknesses such as deathly aversion to alcohol. " The wine at the church. What? "In all my research "I have found no documented method "of killing the creature. "The death of the possessed body "means nothing, as it will retreat inside, using it as a shield. " This rules out drowning, even fire. Even fire? Oh, my God. Ladies. Oh! Oh, yeah. Smile for me, baby. Smile. Oh, man. Oh, you are so pretty. What the hell? Oh, my God! Did you see that? Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Come, on guys, I got rights now. I'm an American. No, no, no! This guy was here before! Get off, off, off! I want your badge numbers! - I will sue you all! - Calm down! Is this the guy from Interpol? Show me the body. Taxi! Come on. Should we call somebody? Who do you think is gonna believe our story? I hardly believe our story. It's been seven bodies now, Jess. We give up now, that thing, it's gonna be free to multiply. So what, then? We have to get it out of him ourselves. The way to do it... is all right here. You still have the key to the old lady's coach house? Okay. We're in business. Hmm. - Jess? - He's still in the bar. I've been keeping watch. You sure this is how you want to do this? You have any better ideas, please let me know. So, what do you think? Wow. Let's do this. This guy doesn't have much time. Give me more nuts! Hey. A beer, please. And a bourbon straight. Thank you. It's taken care of. It's not gonna happen. Again, the same. Hi. How are you doing tonight? A whole lot better. How about you? Not too good, fat man. Heh. What could possibly be wrong in your world? See him? That's my boyfriend. He's been cheating on me with that wench for weeks. Treated me like dirt for years. Tonight it ends. Really? Tonight... I'm gonna teach him a lesson. I'm going to sleep with the fattest, ugliest man in this bar. Namely you. How about it? Always happy to help a damsel in distress. Okay, let's go then. What, now? It's now or never, big boy. Oh, now, now. Uh- Just one thing. Can I... ...take pictures? Even better. Wait, wait, wait. You already have a hotel room? You really are something. You have no idea. Oh, man. Damn. Low light in here. Hang on just a second, sweetheart. Nice. What's with the chair? Sit down. Find out. All right. Hang on a second. I'll be right back. Oh, okay. God, he stinks. Are you ready? Just about. What? You're hammered. Pretty much. I need his undivided attention. Ah. Whoa, what's with the rope? I don't do rope. We either do it my way, or I go out there and I find someone else. Rope is good. I do rope. Good. You know, it's just that I've- It's never been done to me before. - There's something inside you, - Uh-huh. and it needs to come out. Oh, yeah. I so need a shower. What? Hey. Lady, hey! Hello. Aww, no, no. Come on! No! I'm getting rolled here! Help! Help! Hel-! All right, I'll be brief. You have an infectious parasite inside of you. Fortunately, it's only been an hour since it infected you, so you might survive. Okay, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna run an electrical current through your body. That should bring it to the surface. Then I'm gonna grab it with these tongs, gonna pull it out of you, and put it into that vessel filled with wine, where it should fall into suspended state. All right, Jesse. Hit it! Okay, okay! I'm sorry. I don't know how much he can take. Hit it again! We must of blown a fuse. Fuse box! I got it! Is he alive? I... I don't know. - Jess. - I can't tell if he's dead! - Jesse! - What? I'm about to smash your skull in with this lamp. Excuse me? What? Oh, no! It's inside me. Get down! Aah! Run! Get out of here! I can't leave you like this! I'm gonna kill you! The alcohol. You were drinking. No. No, Jesse. I can't stop! What? Don't let this happen. If I leave, they'll spread. That's all they live for. You can do it. I love you. Do it. You ugly mother! - What the hell is going on? - What are you doing? What do you want me to do? Go get help! Good night. Help! Help! You. Who are you? Where is it? It takes 1500 degrees to kill. Where did that thing come from? I know I may have to kill them. You're a goetic practitioner, aren't you? You've learned much in such a short time. My admiration is yours. Are there any more of them out there? Most were killed many years ago. It's been 30 years since my last. My work is done here. So California, huh? Do you got room enough for two on that bike?
