God created men first. He is on our side. He knows Men are born to enjoy. That's why God created Men first. May be he is right. But you know very well about trial and error. God created men first as a trial. He knew the trial was a failure. That's why he created sweet, beautiful women. Since they were created half baked, they still remain half baked. God himself didn't knew on what issues they agree and what issues they don't, To resolve this age old fight, God created love. Love is the magic that unites man and woman from different regions. - Don't follow me. Get lost... - Please listen to me.. - Don't follow me. Get lost. - Please listen to me... Hey wait... - All are watching, go away. - Swetha, please listen to what l say... Don't ever face me. Take them back. Give me one last chance.. Love is like a road signal. Joy and anger keep changing alternately. Love too gets jammed occasionally like traffic jam. Those who have patience, cross the love signal easily. Those who rush, have a brush with death. Union and separation are common in love. Who can predict when people will unite and when they will separate? He is our hero, Karthik. Let's see what happens in his life. Excuse me, Jhansi? There... Looks like she won't spare him today. Poor boy! Come in.. Why are you behaving like this? You asked what l wanted to ask. Clever! l've seen many fights like this. lt's not a big issue at all. They fight now and reconcile later. - Janu, don't be foolish. - You made me a fool all these days. Don't you know about Jhansi? She never gives a second chance. Get lost. Now l'm not interested to talk with you. - What was my mistake? - You are faultless... Please... No. l don't want to see you. Get out. Hi Janu... Don't call me Janu. Call me Jhansi. Why are you getting tensed now? Cool down. Nothing wrong happened here. Stop talking. l saw everything. What other proof you want? No Jhansi. lt just happened. Just happened? You may take it just like that.. But l can't think so. Please control your anger. - Please try to hear me patiently. - No need. l didn't come to fight or hear your stupid explanations. From now we are strangers to each other. Everything is over. Enough.. Why did you laugh? Do you think that l'll come back for you again? No. Why are you killing me like this? Don't touch me. Don't try to convince me. Everything is over between us. June goes to make way for July... When eyes meet, it's love... Flower bloom to give honey... When girls look, it's a blaze of fire... Don't know what happened... Don't know how it happened... - Friendship blossomed... - No love... - Love blossomed... - No friendship... Yesterday & tomorrow are not real only today is reality... O dude! What are the stings of kisses for?. To enjoy the sweet pain... June goes to make way for July... When eyes meet, it's love... Flower bloom to give honey... When girls look, it's a blaze of fire... lt can't rain inside a room... Come out to enjoy life... This Earth is basket ball... And sky is the basket... Remove the black spots on the moon... Free your mind and let it fly... No flower ever sheds tears... June goes to make way for July... When eyes meet, it's love... Flower bloom to give honey... When girls look, it's a blaze of fire... Don't know what happened... Don't know how it happened... - Friendship blossomed... - No love... - Love blossomed... - No friendship... Let's be frank... Let's smile like a flower... A sculptor chisels out a statue from stone... A woman's eyes sculpt we men... This world may have seen many love tales... This world may have witnessed myriad of changes... Nobody in this world is Lord Rama, a role model of men... June goes to make way for July... When eyes meet, it's love... Flower bloom to give honey... When girls look, it's a blaze of fire...

To enjoy the sweet pain... Yesterday l saw a newly released film. lt was a big bore. l went with him... That's why you should choose a good boy friend. Watch, he will turn back to see me. - Watch out... - No.. - He isn't turning back... - Don't turn. Control yourself. Hi, good morning... Hey Karthik, come here. Congratulations, Karthik. l'm sending to Australia for - Thank you sir. - Thank you sir.- Congrats! Sivaraman sir, your daughter is studying in Melbourne, right? Where is she? She is not in Australia, she is in South Africa. - Sir, please don't lie. - Go away... go... l'll beat you. What do you think of yourself? You're insulting me. Crazy fellow! Hari, what happened to you? Normally girls kiss their boy friends, right? But my girl friend punched me. He is going abroad tomorrow. Allow him to pack. Who is Tsunami? lt's Priya, boy! Yes Priya... l'll be there. She isn't Tsunami. She is 'Punch' Priya. She is pain in the neck. l don't know what makes her angry... Hey stop it. Always chanting Priya's name! l'm really fed up of you. l'm sharing my sorrow. What bothers you, boy? lt's paining, boy. What is your problem? There you are! We both went out yesterday. What are you thinking? l'm thinking about wickets that may have fallen in lndia-Pakistan cricket match. So, you didn't think of me, did you? Cricket is more important to you than me, right? ls it the way to reply? Okay, fine. l was thinking about our first meeting in this same place. How lucky l am! You should have said this not that. - Sister is inside. - Okay, forget it. Once when we both were sitting in a park. - A beautiful... - Come on... A beautiful girl... A beautiful girl crossed us... That girl is beautiful, isn't she? She is okay. She looks beautiful because of height. Am l short then? l didn't mean that. When compared to tall girls, you are little short. l think it's bad time for you. What would you do if l die suddenly? Won't you marry another girl? No idea. You should marry again and be happy. Okay. Won't you take photographs with her? Will you hang that photo in your bed room? Only then she'll be happy, won't she? Will you give away all my clothes to her? How is it possible? Her hip size is 28. And she is taller too. How will it suit her? Don't joke. Did she punched you? Buddy, you haven't yet read the minds of girls. Every word has different meaning in their dictionary. lf a girl say 'Yes'... it means 'No, think again'. lf she ask to wait for 5 minutes...? lt means l'll take 30 minutes, if you've any work, finish it. lf she says 'Your wish'. lt means, 'Won't you listen to me?' lf she says it raising her eyebrows, 'Won't you ever listen to me?' Okay. lf she says, 'lt's okay'. lt means, 'Some day you'll come to me, l'll make you regret for it'. Ask him what if she says, 'Thanks'. lf she says 'Thanks'... Good question. lt means you've got much more than what you deserve. Understood? Stop talking about girls. And do some thing better and constructive. You will reach great heights in life. She is right, isn't she? She is asking us to get out. Oh sorry! Wipe with this. You're salivating profusely. Sister, l thought l had seen her somewhere. l was watching you. No use of blaming you. - Even now, my husband ogles at girls. - Sister, not only brother-in-law, every man in this world desires other woman. ls it wrong to stop and admire a beautiful girl? There are many associations to solve women's' problems. But not a soul to support men. Men are really pathetic. You've Blue Cross, haven't you? They take good care of street dogs too. Sister, this is too much. l too respect some girls. Some girls make me think of Mother Theresa. l salute them. Some girls are like lndira Gandhi, l salute them. Some girls are like midnight masala, l fall prey to it. Chemistry. What can l do for that? Don't give lame excuses to your flirtations. Sister, look there... Hey stop it. What's this? Bye sister. Take care. Don't worry. - Call me on reaching. Bye Karthik. - Okay. May l help you? Which seat? lt's over there. Excuse me. Some cotton please. Thank you sir. Passengers are now requested to fasten their seat belts. ls it your first journey? Yes. Okay, l'll help you. Hey, we are going to travel together for 17 hours. - l'm Deepika. - Hi. - l'm Karthik. - Hi. You want coffee to drink? - Cold coffee? - Hot coffee and juice. - Hot coffee for him. - No thank you.- Okay. Who made the silly rule of appointing only women as Hostess?? Why can't they appoint men? l feel bore. How long will you go through this magazine? Talk to me.. Or sing.. Where are you from? Why? Are you contesting in any election? l want you to say something funny, but you're asking my bio-data? Are you going to Melbourne? No. l'm planning to jump down midway. No use of talking to you. l don't think you will give a good company to me. Give me your cell phone. l'll read your future. You've wasted your life. You've lead a worthless life. How can you say so? You haven't stored a girl's number in your phone? You haven't fallen in love or never had girl friends? l've stored all girls' names as boys' names. l had a doubt! l'm also like you. l haven't stored names, just code words. Are you wondering about me? l'm advanced in everything. Why should l hesitate to talk or move with men? l know that nobody will misbehave with me. Do you know my friend's list? l like friends. Mine is take it easy policy. l'll accept you also as my friend. We can be friendly for atleast 15 hours. - Let's celebrate it. - Juice please. Cheers! MELBORNE - AUSTRALlA l had a good time with you. Collect your luggage and come. l'll wait outside. Excuse me. - Hi, l'm Deepika. - Hi, l'm Jhansi. - l'll see you later. - Okay. - Shall we go? - Just a minute... A person came with me. Please wait for him. - Who is he? - My friend. Karthik.. - That orange T shirt? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Hey Karthik... Excuse me, your passport please... - Okay, you can go. - Thank you. Deepika, you're here for a contract. l don't want you to give your address or phone number to strangers. Got me? l've given him. - What? - Phone number. - Hello! - Hello Jhansi! - Who do you want to talk to? - l'm Karthik speaking. Have you forgotten me? Who are you to remember? Oh ls it so? Give the phone to Deepika. No one by that name is here. Don't call on this phone. Did you see? He has started his antics. That's why l warned you not to give phone numbers to anyone. Understood? Why do some relationships have short life? Now a days, my youth has started tasting bitter... l've fulfilled my desire in dream... l don't know what happened to me! Hello! - Jhansi... - What do you want? l'm Karthik. l've forgotten past and living happily now. Don't try to convince me. Just think for 2 minutes... Don't you feel the love and happiness we had once between us? That was an accident. Nobody remembers accidents. Your anger is false. You fear that you may change your mind by talking to me. Nonsense! - No. lt's a fact. - Don't imagine things. You're troubling me because of this phone number, right? You can never talk to ma again. Get lost. Why do some relationships have short life? Now a days, my youth has started tasting bitter... l've fulfilled my desires in dream... l don't know what happened to me! Stop... stop...Oh my God! Wait... Hey Look out! Stop the car, man.. Hey, stop.. You're alright? Are you waiting here to help damsels in distress? Hey, wait... Do you like gays more than girl friends? Hey move... Where is Vaithi? He is hiding down there. - What's this? - Photo. l know. Who is in the photo? - Me! - Who is next to you? That's my friend. l met her in the party. - Will she come to party in a swim suit? - Ask her. Stupid! Husband and wife problem. Bloody lndian wife! - Are you a Tamil? - Yes. - Got me? - Yes. l came here to escape from you people. But got trapped. l'm very happy to see a Tamil here. Come on... Don't tell anyone about this incident in lndia? What brings you here? Karthik, l'm just coming. My name is Karthik. lt's been years since l heard Tamil. My name is Vaithi. Your place? Thanjavur is my native place. l stay in Chennai. My native place is also Thanjavur. l left my place 15 years ago. l'm happy when l happen to meet Tamils like you. - My shop. What would you like to have? - Coffee. Coffee one, let's sit and chat. What are you doing? Tell me about yourself. Your dad called on phone. Can't you go out informing me? l'm searching you since morning. l saw Karthik while coming from library. We got late while talking. ls he the man who came with you in the flight? Right. Do you remember him? Where are you going? l need to buy something in that restaurant. Can't you buy while going home? No, they will close by that time. Come... - Where is Karthik? - He left just 5 minutes earlier. What do you want to buy? l was searching you only. Thank God! You're here. Karthik, meet Jhansi. FESTlVAL TlME...THlRUVlDANTHAl Children! Can't you take your dad carefully? Am l dad if l come with children? Do l look like a father of kids? That's it. You purposefully dash with handsome guys. l didn't do it purposefully. Moreover, you're not handsome too. Mind your words. You be happy for dashing a beautiful girl. l didn't get a chance. Today you're dipping legs. Tomorrow you may have to drown. All these happiness will last for a couple of months only. After that you may have to drown yourself in pond for your wife's tortures. Brides' people should drown themselves for selecting such a groom. Bride must also drown herself for marrying a man like him. Let's go. We are handsome. - That's why they're turning back to see. - Friend, don't worry. Come on... What's going on, friend? She looks beautiful. Don't know which place she belongs to? Have patience... Madam, excuse me. She is complaining to the police. - Aren't you interested in getting promotion? - Why not? Minister's son is there. You're ignoring him. Who is it? There...that tall guy in yellow shirt. She is pointing finger at you. Escape... Head Constable, catch them. Go fast... Superb! Really beautiful. Don't know her whereabouts. How can we find her? - l've an idea. - Please tell me... You know her car number, right? - Shall we go to RTO office? - Shit! That is old fashion. Hit your car somewhere... Lodge a complaint saying her car hit yours. - She will come to your place. - Will it work out? Try.. He did it. Okay sir. Thank you sir. Hello... - Why did you do like this? - Just to meet you. - Why? - Love has no reasons. Don't how you fall in love at first sight? Magic happens in a jiffy. That's the speciality of love. l'm not as you think. Thanks for thinking about my point of view. Why should l think of you? Even if you say 'no'.. Rain united us. Did you see? You're drenching in rain for my sake. That is called as love. Sharing a umbrella is also love. You go anywhere. l'll follow you. l'll be with you only. l'll be in your heart for ever. For the first time l'm excited... Come on, my dear... Come alone to become part of me... Come on, my dear... l'm on cloud nine because of you... l've found my identity from you... You're a drop of ocean, a tip of sky and pinch of a cyclone... l was astonished... You're a colourful night... You're my life... You're my eyelid... l craved for you... For the first time l'm excited... Come on, my dear... Come alone to become part of me... Come on, my dear... l fell for your sharp looks and shyness... l lost my sleep... l'm following you like a leaf on the river... Will you take me to the shore? Will you fulfill my desire? l've changed completely... l've turned into pieces... For the first time l'm excited... Come on, my dear... Come alone to become part of me... Come on, my dear... l'm on cloud nine because of you... l've found my identity from you... You are rain and l am summer... Rain and shine together is pleasant weather... Without bothering about what is right or wrong... l don't know what has brought me to this stage...? l never expected this from myself... There are 2 skies for me... clouds of love are passing on both the skies.. l'm on cloud nine because of you... l've found out my identity from you. You're a drop of ocean, a tip of sky and pinch of a cyclone... l was astonished... You're a colourful night... You're my life... You're my eyelid... l craved for you... l'll be there within 10 minutes. - Please... - Okay. Sorry. Caught in Traffic jam. - l'll be there in 5 minutes. - Okay. Hello, just half an hour... please wait.. l can't wait anymore. l'm really sorry. l'll be there within half an hour. l'll take leave. No, l'll go. Are you leaving? Were you here till now? l watched all your face reactions in this half an hour. l really loved it. Earlier, you followed me. Now you've made me to follow you. Hey, why are you getting angry now? lt was just for fun. Why are you always playful? Why do you want to be serious? Should lovers always be serious? Who said so? l can't change my nature. Don't lose your temper. Ask why l did so. - No need. - l'm lucky to see you waiting for me. l was admiring that moment. lt's not a big thing. l'm going to wait for you all my entire life. - Hi, how are you? - l'm fine. - What man? - Give me. Sir, can you guide me to this address? - Go straight and turn left. - Okay. Only aunts are crossing our way. We deserve only this. Hey keep quiet. Won't we get a good figure? Hey look there.. Hey, l'm telling the truth... Please believe me. l called her thinking she is Priya... But unfortunately it was her sister... Got caught! This is too much... You cheat! Good culture! Kissing is the starting point of their wedlock. Ours has many customs and traditions, And we used to get fed up before our first night. Won't you have any other thought? - No. - No. Why not? Even yesterday l saw National Geographical channel. A good scientific subject. They showed what elephants do when they get romantic. That was a live show for 2 hours. l was really shocked. Very interesting. - Did you watch it fully? - Yes sir. Can't you keep quiet? Happy married life. Sunil, this is Karthik, my friend. Hi Sunil. l won't leave you just like that in my wedding. lt's time for youth and exuberance to unite... Excitement has slipped through hands like sand... lt's time for youth and exuberance to unite... Excitement has slipped through hands like sand... Went silent forgetting the old words... Wished to sing new lines of a new song... We fell for beautiful girls... lt's gentle breeze of love breeze... Shower of love flowers... And only enjoyment... A dazzling moon is floating in the breeze of love... Love birds have united in the air of love... A dazzling moon is floating in the breeze of love... Love birds have united in the air of love... She has left. Got caught! Excuse me, one cheese Pizza. - How much? - Rs 100. - For you? - Order Pizza for me too. - Make it two. - Yes madam. Hey, 2 cheese Pizzas. lf you don't like it, why did you order then? You like it, don't you? You needn't pretend sacrificing things for my sake. Pizza is not the only thing l don't like... What did you say now? Repeat.. Pizza is not the only thing l don't like. What else then? l don't like many things. Don't say it in general. Specify what you dislike in me. No. lt will lead to quarrel. Quarrel will start only if you don't tell me. l don't like your short temper and obstinate behaviour. l don't like the condition you laid for me not to see any other girl. Above all, l hate your picking fight for every silly reason. There are 100's of peeves l've with you. There are 1000's of peeves l've with you. When l say 100, you said 1000, that's women's distinctive character. Men's character is to stifle woman's voice. No woman trusts man. Even God isn't exception to this. Men are born liars. Even God belongs to this group. All men are idiots. lt's true. How can they love women if they were intelligent? You men are perverted, always trying to trap girls. lf you see a man, it's just seeing. lf we see a girl, is it ogling? Women always partial. Why to argue unnecessarily? Go with the girl you like. Please leave me. Janu, all are looking at us. Cool down. Your friend is here. Oh no! Your friend is here. - Go and see. - To hell with him. He is a watchman. First you go.. What's this? You've made me a watchman. Got my point? Take it as helping a friend. Nobody is at home. All have gone to Tirupathi. So, l thought of talking freely with Priya. - l've to struggle a lot for it. - Your sister won't come, will she? She won't. She went to watch a film with her friend. lt will take 2 hours. You manage if courier or cable man comes. Watch TV if you're bored. l don't think it's going to be a talk with all your preparations. l think it's going to be a wrestling bout. Karthik, don't reveal the truth. Just store it in mind. You've bought her, haven't you? Go and enjoy. Go... Come on... Oh dear! What are you going to do to me? Hey Raju... Hey, it's getting late. Come fast. - l left my purse. Just 2 minutes. - Okay. - What? - Your sister has come. Hey, what to do now? l'll manage. You keep quiet. Why did you come? Can't you keep quiet? Hey, tell me...what happened? l left my purse. - Purse? - l kept it here only. Why are you standing like a wall? Come on.. search, man. Why are you searching here? - Go and check your room. - You're right. Go and search there.. l'll tackle everything. Who is she? She is Karthik's girl friend. She's troubles and wants to have a free talk with him. That's why l allowed her. Come on, man... Tell her, friend. Yes. Priya and l love each other. Her parents are against our love. l have to convince my sister. That's why we came here to discuss about it. Oh! Sorry. l mistook you. You are a perfect couple. Thanks. Good guess. We love each other for more than 4 years. Ours is sincere love. Suddenly, we got into trouble. Don't know what to do. Ours is true love. l'm ready to face any problem to marry her. That's good. Who else is there for him? We should only support him. You're right. Hey! Sorry, Janu. Please listen to me and go. - Please just 1 minute... - Don't follow me. Get lost. l'll start shouting at you then. Janu, please try to understand me. That girl was Raju's lover. l lied so to help him from her sister. Am l not important to you? Your friend is important, right? Why did you insult me before an outsider? You've mistaken me, Janu No. They are important to you than me. You marry your friend. Leave me. No Janu. You are only important for me. Lie. Everything is a lie. You decide whether you want me or your friends. l got abused from her because of you. You lied and shouting at him? Hey, don't talk like him. l lied to her for your sake. Hey, what she wants now? She has asked me to finalise before 10 am. - lt's 10.30 now. Not yet decided? - Oh my God! Hey, Jhansi is online. Sorry Janu. l was little bit late. Where are you now? ln Raju's house. lnspite of my advises, still you haven't reformed? Not like that, Janu. l've come to discuss about our issue. Oh my God! You be with your friends forever! l'm dying here. Are you laughing at me? l'll go and convince her. l'll see you later. - Jhansi. - ls it Jhansi? Give it to me. - Jhansi here. - Jhansi. lsn't Karthik there? He hasn't come here. l think he must be in Jenny's house. Try her number.. You stupid! - Why did you come here? - No, Janu. - Where were till now? - At Raju's place. Enough, how many lies will you tell? l don't want to believe you anymore. Don't create a scene here, get lost! Janu, open the door. You're everything to me, friends are nothing to me. l've given up all of them. Give me one last chance tomorrow. l'll be with you entire day. l'm at your service. You can get angry if l do any mistake then. Okay? l'll meet tomorrow at 8 am, okay? Bye Janu. Look, l kept my promise. You always misunderstand me. - You want one? - Yeah! There's a similarity between bubble gum & girls, you know? - What is it? - Both are sweet initially. Later it will become tasteless. - Perverted! - Just a joke! Stupid! Buddy! Look there! - Hi! - Hi! Where are you going? To office. Has Jhansi joined your office? Don't lie buddy. Where are you going? T.Nagar. He's going to Panagal Park, drop him there on the way. - Buddy, you go in the car. - Okay. Hello. Two fishes are getting married. Tiny fishes are the processionists. The marriage is happening in mid-sea. lt's fun and frolic for everyone there. Hello. lt's Jenny! Hi Jenny! When did you come from Bangalore? Forget it...you sent a girl, right? - What was her name? - Sweety! Yes...Sweety! ls she a girl? She took all of us to a party, Karthik and she had great time there. lnfact it made me feel shy, trust me. Then two more girls came for company, how many beers those girls had? l swear they are not girls at all. Then l couldn't take it anymore, l escaped from there. Then our Karthik spent all night with them. Karthik dropped them next day. Why? Get down from the car. - Why? - Car will not move from here. Go. Angry on me? Go! l'll smash your face...go. l say go. Get lost! What happened Jhansi? Leave me alone Karthik. l'm not your love. Love is just a time pass for you. Stop. You're the most important person in my life. - l'll do anything for you. - l know. The man who can do anything for me, what's the guarantee that you'll not ditch me for a better girl? Why are you killing me in installments? Am l killing you? Look, what's your idea about me? That's what you make me think. l don't want anyone to die for me. No need of this love at all. What do you want me to do? You'll never change. l'm tired of advising you. Leave me, and go with any girl you want to. Won't you ever try to understand me? Why do you always misunderstand me? l'll stop thinking, but you always do the wrong. Your friend certified it too. Tomorrow is my birthday. You know the plans l had for the occasion? Won't you get girls to drink and dance and have fun? Leave me alone. Oh My! Didn't see you? - No problem. - l'm sorry. - Pepsi? - No. - Pop corn? - Thank you. - Film is boring, right? - Yeah bore. Shall we go to the canteen? - Yeah, okay. - Yeah. - Hello! - l'm Raju! - Hello! - l'm Raju! l can't hear you. l'm Raju! l'm in a office meeting. l'll call you later. - Who is it? - Useless guys! They call me for free drinks. You wait here, l'll come back in 5 minutes. Excuse me. - What's your problem? - Please! Hello! Happy Birthday! - Thank you. - Where are you? l'm at home in confusion. l'm finishing fourth beer watching your photo. Aren't you out with friends to celebrate? Friends, love...everything is lie. Loneliness is the only truth in this world. Getting philosophical. Love is a game of hide & seek. l got cheated. l think you're drunk, let's talk tomorrow. Bye. Nice cake. How do you know today is my birthday? Should l've to tell you? But you cut the cake first. Tell me first. l was sent to keep you happy on your birthday. What? Were you engaged? Who? - Hello! - lt's me! You like spending time with any girl other than me. That's why, my surprise gift to you. - No Janu. - No. l don't want to fight with you today. What ever it may be, let's discuss tomorrow. Happy Birthday. - Excuse me. - Yeah. Somewhere...there! Then l think... what do you think about this? l think today she'll finish him once for all. He's trapped. Why are you doing it to me? You asked it before l could ask. Clever. l never believed in this. You chased me madly with love. Few days and it has blown over. Don't talk foolish. You fooled me all these days. - You never understood me. - How can l? Your thoughts and words are totally different. You or me isn't the reason, it's nature. Two different characters, man...and woman. Maybe but aren't there many couples living together? Don't they fall in love? That's what l'm asking you, why do you always over react? No, this is office, don't make me shout at you. This will not work out, please go away. Please think for a minute without getting angry. What have l done now? Yes, you didn't do anything, l'm a foolish woman, l'm a suspicious woman. Please go away from here. l don't want to see your face, please go away. - Please...leave. - Come on Jhansi. Please Jhansi...come on. Oh God! Go. l say leave. - Janu. - Leave. Has she insulted you so much? l can't believe it. Haven't you forgotten her yet? You still love her? What are you thinking? - Tell me. - Old memories. Passing clouds. lf she had failed to understand you, problem isn't with you, the problem is with her. Be happy man! Am l not here? Hello Miss Headache! Happy trouble! O Girl! The other side is always green... Are eyes algae? Let's slip happily... Looking at me stealthily... ls it a lie? Sweet nothings... Flower bouquets...

And for troubles too... First you get closer with friendship... Suddenly the relationship changes... You're a beautiful allergy... But you're the energy... lf asked what's the time? Men's hearts skip a beat... You see just once... But you chase every day... Hello Miss Headache! Happy trouble! O Girl! The other side is always green... Are eyes algae? Let's slip happily... You make us smile first... Later you make us shed tears... We trust and tie the knot with you... Later we regret for it and wipe our tears... The mark of your lip stick on my lips is a never healing wound... l love fondling... l love caressing... You and me... Jump the fence...no...no... Hello Miss Headache! Happy trouble! O Girl! The other side is always green... Are eyes algae? Let's slip happily... Looking at me stealthily... ls it a lie? Sweet nothings... Flower bouquets... Don't believe it boy! My beautiful fiance... A pretty and lovely cyclone... My beautiful fiance... A ravishing beauty who made me walk on clouds... My beautiful fiance... A pretty and lovely cyclone... My beautiful fiance... A ravishing beauty who made me walk on clouds... When men meet there are many things to talk, but when girls meet they talk about only boys. Don't know who is getting kicked. He's dead. Because they are the only headache a girl has. Men forget even the biggest event in his life, but woman never forget even the smallest incident. - That's the main problem. - Stupid. He's just joking, why are you taking it seriously? Relax. They are like that only. Childhood problem. What do you mean by childhood problem? A problem that grows from your childhood. You don't know how to talk to girls, come, enjoy and leave. Come. You've lighter? Vaithi! Come here. - What? - Come here, l'll tell you. You carry on, l'll join you. l've been watching you for long time, why are you following me? Am l following you? l met you here. l wanted to say Hi! You didn't like it, so l gave up. You're doing all this with some ulterior motive. Look at them! You don't imagine things. l was happy forgetting my past, l'm facing this trouble after your arrival only. - You're the reason for the problem. - What's their problem? Their problem will never end. Who makes mountains out of molehills and fights? You or me? What's your problem? Do you think yourself to be a wonder? Do you think l'll not get any girl other than you? No girl will hate boys looking at her. She expects him to look at her only. That's why all this lipstick, hairstyle, makeup. Only a girl can solve another girl's problem. You said it right. Do something. l never felt like missing something in my life. To brood over the past, or to worry about future, no place for all this in my life. Am l happy today? That's important to me. l want to live this minute. Watch now! lf l date with him, let me see her reaction. Smile...be happy. Come, let's go. Where are you taking me to? l've some other work. Where are you trying to slip away? l've an important meeting. l've to go. Meeting at 9 pm? - Tell me the truth. - Okay. l'm going to Strip Tease. Strip Tease...? Just like the cabaret dance in our country. l will also come with you. You shouldn't go there. Why not? l will come. Can l have 2 Bacardis? One with coke & one with... He is looking at you. She is ogling at you. Hi! l want that. l want to take it myself. Get her down. What's your problem lady? Get away. Waiting for a chance to touch girls! Always waiting for a chance to touch a girl. You over reacted. He was right. You are too orthodox. Don't you see yourself in the mirror? lf you are going to be like this, now is the right time to change. When your opinions change, it brings a change in your looks. When your looks change, desires sprout from within. When desires sprout, he will come. Hey...look. Full moon...my full moon... Your eyelids darkened at the edges with kohl... ..hiding innumerable lies... You shattered my shyness... and arrested me in you... You made me struggle and drown in my tears... Your eyes are magical... You saw me & l'm spell bound... What would you do with me rest of my life? Full moon...my full moon... Your eyelids darkened at the edges with kohl... ..hiding innumerable lies... The sky is showering gentle flowery rain... Raising bad intentions in me... Be patient...let our love succeed... The flower has bloomed for me... May l taste the honey? Why has the fruit ripened? For the squirrel to taste it... Can flower and wind make love if they wait for the good time? Full moon...my full moon... Your eyelids darkened at the edges with kohl... ..hiding innumerable lies... May l drape you as clothes? What am l to say? You're raking the passion of fire in me... A beautiful raging fire is near to engulf me... Why are you attracted to fire? The fire of passion and body can't get doused without you... Full moon...my full moon... Your eyelids darkened at the edges with kohl... ..hiding innumerable lies... You shattered my shyness... and arrested me in you... You made me struggle and drown in my tears... Your eyes are magical... You saw me & l'm spell bound... What would you do with me rest of my life? What would you do with me rest of my life? He looks like the dog in the Hutch advt. What happened? l'm heartbroken. Heartbroken..? When you're heartbroken, buy drinks from your money. And not from other's money. You won't understand my feelings. Vaithi, look at him. You might die. - What's your problem? - Personal. You drink from my money. What personal now? Love. Guys, he is love...!? From the day l came to this country, l am in love with a girl. But she never gives me a chance. What does she say? She keeps repeating the same thing. l understood nothing. All girls are alike. They never give us a chance to speak. He is very much worried. Help him. What's her phone number? Hello... Why did you hit him? l will kill you. What did she say? lt is a voice mail of some cell phone company. - lt is a recorded message. - lsn't she a girl? Don't make me kill you. All my kick has gone to dogs. - ls my love a failure? - No. lt will get a distinction. Better run away. You call this love. Shit! What happened? My car broke down. No one is offering me lift in the highway. l will offer you lift. But on one condition. You should neither hold my shoulders, nor touch my waist or rub against my body. And more importantly, keep your mouth shut. Got it? Sit. - Hello... - What now? Keep both your legs this side & sit. lt's good that his car broke down. Why are you driving so rash? You hold me tight when l drive, don't you? lt is just for that. While taking a turn, or in potholes, or while applying sudden brakes. Joy in driving a bike is...heaven. Get down. This is why l refused to offer you a lift. Jhansi, it is not my mistake. No excuses. l knew you would do this. Karthik, any problem? Deepika, my car broke down and l asked Jhansi for a lift. l hugged her when she applied brakes. Nothing like that. Okay. Forget it. l will give him a lift. Come with me. l will give him a lift. Come with me. What bothers you if she takes him with her? So, there is something in you. Jhansi, why are you sitting here? Looks like you offered lift to someone and he ditched you midway. You're saying as if you've seen it. No girl will sit alone like this if she is not angry with someone. Boys are the only problem of girls. Nothing like that. Wait here for 5 minutes. l will come back soon. More...little more. Brush it again. Shall me move? What's happening there? Foreigners do R&D in rockets to cows. lt's about men. About men? What do you mean by that? That bull is refusing to mate with this cow. Some family problem. - Even cows expecting more nowadays. - What? A bull will mate a cow only once. To make that bull mate that same cow again, the cow has to waxed. a new scent has to be sprayed on it. And then make the bull believe the cow as a new one. Come on. Get the bull out. Jhansi, when cows need a different mate everytime, think about the humans. ls this the final design? lf you finalize it, l will email it. Wait for another 2 minutes. l will finish this off. No problem. Take your own time. We can even send it tomorrow. You who stole a girl's heart, express your feelings too. You sparked the fire in me, come out with your desires. Where are you going now? Rugby match final. Karthik promised to pick me up. Jhansi, when cows need a different mate everytime, think about the humans. Wait. l will also come. l feel very hungry. Buy me something to eat. l feel very hungry. Buy me something to eat. You missed it. Karthik, look there. - What happened? - What a match Karthik! You missed the match. Pascal's kick at the end of the match was out of the world. Fabulous! Brilliant! l missed my car keys. Excuse me. Ouch!...Karthik. What happened? l got hurt. - Where? - Over here. ls it paining? One minute... l can't walk. What happened? Nothing. l wanted to see your face when he carries me in his arms. Superb! What you did is wrong. Why do you drink too much? Get up. You come here for free drinks. Go to your bedroom. He is drunk as always! Good night friends. Wearing goggles at night? l met 2 boys from our country. Hope they don't give me an eye infection. That's why goggles. ls it? l've a super gel, apply that in your eyes. Really! Okay. You are my true friend. Open your eyes. lt smells bad. Did you check the expiry date. You are drunk. Open your eyes after 5 minutes. You can see very clearly. Really! My eyes are burning. My eyes are burning. l can't open my eyes. l can't open my eyes. What medicine is that? lt is good one. l saw this in TV too. - F E V l C O L - You idiot! You applied fevicol, a glue. You illiterate! Who gave you an Australian visa? - Government. - Government? l need someone's help to go to toilet. - l will help you. - To see me piss. l will take you there. Go inside & piss. That's the toilet. Make sure no one comes inside. - Because l can't see. - Okay. Deepika, where were you? Dating. l saw you with Karthik in skating rink. Okay. Why are you asking me then? You came here for a contract. And not to date with someone. He is not someone. - Karthik is my friend. - Every date starts like this only. l know where it will end. Stop talking like an old lady. l don't care where this friendship ends. What if he flirts with you and ditches you in the end? lf he ditches me, l will ditch him too. Simple. You will learn only from your mistakes. - What's your problem? - That's not important. l am telling this for your good. You have misunderstood boys. Boys will flirt with many girls. But they are very close to only one. Nonsense. Why do you hate Karthik so much? What do you know about him? l know him better than you do. We were in love once. He was in love with me. Me too. Are you separated once for all? Doesn't he come in your dreams? Don't you think about him when you are alone? Don't talk about him with me. So, Karthik ditched you. There is no place for him in your life. Am l right? Are you sure? l've forgotten everything and living a peaceful life. Good night. l feel you still love Karthik. Never. There is no place for love or Karthik in my life. No problem. l will love Karthik. What do you mean? Till this moment, it was only friendship between me & Karthik. But now, l feel why shouldn't l love him? The qualities you hate in Karthik are the ones l love. Stop talking like a fool. Love is foolish. Only now, it has started to take roots in my heart. l like Karthik. l love Karthik. l don't know whether he loves me or not. He will also fall in love with me within a week. Watch it happen. Good night. Sweet dreams. DAY 1 On day 1... ..something... ..can bring a change in you... and make you hot... My heart sings in joy... Who taught it to sing? lt will never stop on my command... And it never listens to my words... O my love! On day 1... ..something... ..can bring a change in you... and make you hot... When l'm thirty for love... ..and you come as a cloud to quench my thirst... ..won't my heart rejoice? Neither anyone has drowned fully... nor floated on it... This is what people who fall in the ocean of love go through... l've come this far to stay away from the LOVE virus... On day 1... ..something... ..can bring a change in you... and make you hot... Sow the seeds of love in young hearts... else you are an island sans life... You need a life partner... Uttering the word 'LOVE' will get you into trouble... lt's robs your sleep all your life... What's life without pain? There is no thrill in life without the pain of love. On day 1... ..something... ..can bring a change in you... and make you hot... Love makes us believe salt crystals as diamonds... Love is a bliss... Still, pain is the residue of love... O my sweetheart! DAY 2 Hi! What are you doing in the dark? My phone fell down. l am looking for it. Then why search my pocket? Why? What is all this, Deepti? She misunderstood me once. And you made her angry. Nothing like that. lt is her nature. You both are girls. When you could understand that, why can't she? Why are you so concerned about her? Just like that. You have kept lot of secrets from me. l know everything. - What? - About your love. Do you still love her? But she never understands me. lf that is the problem, l will make her understand you better. How? She gets angry on seeing me. But not on seeing me. l will plan. - What will you do? - l won't tell you. See me in action. When there is competition, things get more interesting. She will never understand him. l know that. l am going to win. Let's see what is going to happen. What are you reading since morning? Your diary. What? My diary? Don't you know you shouldn't read other's diary? Give it. Reading other's diary is more thrilling than reading any other book. But your diary has nothing interesting. - Jhansi... - Yeah! Thanks. DAY 3 Jhansi, Karthik has invited you for lunch. Pretty cool! - l don't think she will come. - She will definitely come. lt's 3:30 now. She won't come. She is very stubborn. Hey...look. l can't believe it. You guessed it right. She has come. l will go. Don't hurry. Let her wait. She might get upset & go away. lf she wanted to go, she wouldn't have come here. Let's wait. Shall l go? Wait...wait. Have patience. You will get a phone call now. No. Don't talk. Wait. You don't know what she will do when she gets upset. What will she do? She will call you again. Look. Jhansi again. - l know. - Shall l talk? Popcorn.. Please... Stop playing. She might get upset. Why are you waiting then? Go & meet her. Bye. Hi Jhansi! Sorry, l am late. l knew that you will come. Why did you invite me? Since you're here, no need to know the reason. Okay. l will leave. lf you wanted to leave, you wouldn't have come here. What do you want? l want to talk to you. Not much. Just for 10 minutes. What's new? Go ahead. Say something. You waited curiously for 10 seconds to know what l am going to say. That's enough. - This shows you still love me. - Don't imagine. lf you don't mind, let's eat first & fight later. l know what you like. But l don't know whether you still like it or not. l don't have the habit of changing what l like. l lost you. Unlucky fellow. l am very happy to see you again. lt's true. l miss you Jhansi. l don't want to talk about our past & incite you. Let's think we met just now. lf you like, accept me as your friend. Come in. You have 5 new messages. Hi Karthik! No mails for the past 2 days. Your uncle is very upset. What are you doing there? Do you wash your clothes or wear them again? That's why l advised you to get married. Photos you sent were wonderful. Tomorrow Vidhya is getting married in Madurai. We will be back next week. l'll mail you then. Okay. Take care. Bye. Hey Karthik! l've been trying your phone since morning. Where were you? l sent a bouquet to Jhansi. She pretended to be angry. Today our plan will work. Remember how to talk to her. Don't forget that. l'll meet you in the restaurant. Blown it away! l knew it. Everything is over. Jhansi heard what you said from the answering machine, got angry & left. What should l do now? How will l know? l am feeling very sleepy. l am very upset. l want to meet you. Do you know what is the time now? Please come for my sake. Do one thing. lnstead of going after her, why don't you love me? - Deepti, be serious. - Okay. Let's be serious. - Let's meet Jhansi & get to know her problem.- Stop joking. l wonder how you fell in love with her. Did your wavelength match with her's in any one matter. Stop digging our past. Tell me what should l do now. Okay. Give me some time. l will talk to her. Will she accept me? lf she doesn't accept you, leave it. Can't you find another girl? For how long will you love the same old girl? Stop teasing me. The most difficult task in this world, is to unite estranged lovers. Why do you do all this for me? Because l like you very much. DAY 4 Look at this. All these colours. Do you want some coffee? Karthik... Oh my God! Karthik...what happened? Just wait. What? Jhansi...we are going to the Royal hospital. We are almost there. Hello.. Yeah, l need to admit him. - What's his name? - Karthik. - What is his problem? - He hurt his hand. - And what is his nationality? - lndian. - lndian..? - Yeah. - Are you his wife? - No. l am just a friend. Okay. You need to sign here. - Where to? - Thank you. C'mon hurry up. Excuse me. Can l know Karthik's room? Sister, where is the doctor? Where is the doctor? What's wrong with you? - He should be around there. - No. Doctor isn't there. Calm down please. No. Doctor isn't there. He is bleeding. What's wrong with you? Why aren't you doing something? - Relax. Don't be childish. - Why don't they understand? - See there is no one here. - Somebody has to be here. - Where is the doctor? - He should be here. What's the problem? Doctor, my friend cut his hand. He is bleeding. Please help him. You should do something. DAY 5 Turn the page. Lift the paper. Hey Jhansi, come..come. She has come to see you. Don't miss this chance. Tell her all that's in your heart. All the best. Be good. Hi! - How do you feel now? - Better. Thank you. Talk something. Don't spoil it. - What to talk? - Talk something. - You want anything. - l want water. Hi Jhansi, when did you come? A plumber would've done this for $10. But he hurt his hand doing it himself. As his friend, you could have advised him. But getting hurt is good too. Only then a person will know who really cares for him. We marry only for such reasons. Even l got married for the same reasons. Anyway, tomorrow is my wedding anniversary. You must come to house. Okay? Sure. DAY 6 l am busy at home now. Come to office tomorrow. l will be free. We can discuss there. Okay? - l'm igniting a rocket. l am preparing Rasam. - What are you doing here? - lt is getting late. - Okay. Guests have come. Take these & leave. Wear this. Yes..coming. Coming..coming. Welcome Narayana. Sit. Welcome. There she is. That's my wife. l am coming. - Why late? - l am fine. Sorry guys. l am late. You neither have a family nor a child. There is no one to question you. You are a free bird. Thank God! A man is saved. Like other girls, she didn't marry someone and gave birth to a child. That's is not life. Actually, it was Pushpa who was saved. Refusing to marry is the trend now. Girls don't want to marry. But they need a boy friend. What logic is this! When a man can remain a bachelor all his life, why can't a woman? Woman's only problem is man. But women are man's only joy. Men are more selfish for their happiness. Women's nature is to trouble the happy men. To avoid these problems, people prefer love marriages. But now the problem is love marriages. Be it love or arranged marriage. lt is not a problem. What kind of a person you are going to marry is the point. You started the argument! l must shut your mouth. Come, let's eat. Suspicion in love is disaster. What do you expect from a girl after marriage? - You can't be controlled. - Good question. lf l am going to marry her... l have few question for her. - l too have few questions for you. - Right. lf we answer those question & feel right, - then no problem. - Correct. - What do you like most in men? - Lies. Men want to do things secretly. But when they are caught, they are embarrassed. Men can't keep secrets. That's man's nature. Men are really stupid. - What do men hate most in women? - Suspicious nature. Looking for a girl's number in the cell phone. Spying men's clothes for a girl's long hair. Men do not like that. Above all, Woman's main drawback is that they don't want - men to speak or go out with any other girl.- Yeah! - What do you expect from women? - Care & affection. - What do you expect from men? - Security & love. Why do lovers quarrel? First woman wants to win a man's love. Once she gets her man, she wants to know his income, ..savings, when will he build a house for her. lt is then the quarrel starts. That's a woman's nature. When a man wants to win a woman's love, he sends many SMS, presents flowers everyday. But after he wins her love, men make women to wait for hours. That's where the quarrel starts. - That's actually true. - What's women's plus? Behind every successful man, there is a woman's contribution without any expectation. That's not true. Women find the successful men & go after them. That's true. This is man's arrogance. Woman's problem is that she can't enjoy a good joke. ls man superior to woman? Are women superior in this world? You have problems. You too have problems. - That's what l am saying. - So, both are equal. When issues are discussed openly, there won't be any problems. - Correct. - l like that. l like that too. Enough! No more arguments. - Vaithi. - Yes coming. Why do some relationships have short life? Now a days, my youth has started tasting bitter... l've fulfilled my desires in dream... l don't know what happened to me! Return the glass. Bye. You didn't take both today also. Karthik, take care. Hutch dog! Be careful while walking on the road. Okay. Bye. Keerthi, thanks for coming. l am very happy. Do you like me? - l like you. - How much? - l like you very much. - How much? l like you very very very much. Happy? Even my father lies a lot to make me happy. l like men who lie. Say another lie. - You are very beautiful. - Making fun of me? Will you be with me all my life? C'mon say. Yes, l will. So, l will be with you always. Hello... Jhansi...stop. You didn't understand me when we were together. l thought you would've understood me in my absence. You haven't changed a bit. Our love was more of quarrels than happiness. Do you know the most painful thing in this world? When we get separated from our loved ones. That too when a woman rejects a man & leaves him. That moment leaves him with unbearable pain. A pain worse than death. You've given me that pain. Nothing can make one happy or give pain than love. A man cries only when his sweetheart leaves him. lt's enough. l still don't know whether l am in your life or not. You decide it. Thanks Karthik. For what? For making me understand love. l heard your conversation with Jhansi. She is... l thought love was fun. But l understood its pain when you spoke to her. Only now l can feel its pain. Those who failed to express their love are more than those who succeeded in love or failed in love But l don't fall in that list. l love you. l came to know that you don't love me when you slept in the car. Why did l meet you? Why did l spend time with you? Why did l love you knowing that it will never succeed? Everything looks like a miracle, right? lt was just like a dream. Girls don't get all that they wish. They live in dreams. l will live dreaming about you elsewhere. When issues are discussed openly, there won't be any problems. - l like that. - l like that too. Karthik, Jhansi is missing. Did you search properly? l searched everywhere. Wait. l am coming. l am scared. Why do some relationships have short life? Now a days, my youth has started tasting bitter... l've fulfilled my desires in dream... l don't know what happened to me! Why do some relationships have short life? Now a days, my youth has started tasting bitter... l've fulfilled my desires in dream... l don't know what happened to me! Few years later...Sydney. Every love story begins on a happy note. Love's only enemy are the lovers' hearts. lnstead of living all life without understanding your partner, understanding the problem & getting separated is also a kind of love. Why did you get separated from Karthik? Don't ask me about that. There is nothing to say about it. Leave me...please. What do you want? So, you didn't love Karthik. l did love Karthik. But l never understood him. Actually, it was my fault. l wanted him to change according to my whims and fancies. That was the root cause for every problem. But she wasn't like me. She understands him much better than me. She accepted him as what he is. So, you hid your love. Yes. lnstead of being with him and irritate him all the life, l wanted to stay away and make him happy. So, l separated from him. Adjustment is not a solution to any problem. That's temporary solution only. Understanding a person & then accepting as partner is a permanent solution. l understood that now. How would Karthik accept Deepika even if you had sacrificed your love? lf we hadn't met again and if he had met her alone, he would've fell in love with her only. Earlier, l got separated from him without understanding him. But now l've understood and willingly separated from him. And what about your life? l've my job, couple of friends, a peaceful life. This is enough. l am happy. Did you meet Karthik again? l did see him once. - Jhansi... - Deepika. How are you? Your child? Don't tell me. Sweety baby. Lovely! l really can't believe this. Where is Karthik? He was here... Thank you very much. lt is that way. He is still the same. Hasn't changed yet? - That's Karthik. - Yeah. Are you happy? Yeah! Hey Karthik... l will see you later. Bye. Happy? For those who love & get married, love is always a joyful memory. For those who are separated, love is always a painful memory. A soothing pain.
