(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH) Bonjour. (CHUCKLES) - Merci. - Merci. What's that sound? That's the sea. ROLAND: I don't see a radio. I'll try to pick one up tomorrow. VANESSA: Morning. I was trying not to wake you. You were sleeping peacefully. I don't sleep peacefully. You know that. - Are you off to find inspiration? - I have my inspiration. - Then why are we here? - Don't be nasty, darling. If you want, I can be back early for dinner. I need more time. You go write, I'll be fine. All right. - Have a nice day. - VANESSA: I won't. I know. Love you. (DOOR CLOSES) (SOFTLY) I know. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (LINE RINGING) (SIGHS) Fuck. (BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH) (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING FRENCH) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES) Ah. (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) Hey. - Good day? - ROLAND: Nope. Well... I don't know. I don't know. Michel's a sweet man. He's sweet. Do we have food? VANESSA: I walked down a ridiculous hill and went grocery shopping. Then I read a book. It was terrible. I don't know why you worry so much. People publish pure garbage all the time, and nobody seems to mind. ROLAND: I can write. I'm a good writer, remember? You are. I love your words, you know that. (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH ON RADIO) (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) (SEAGULLS CAWING) (SOBS) (EXHALES DEEPLY) ROLAND: You should go for a walk or something today. Might be good for you. Don't have a drink today. Might be good for you. We could be happy, you know. You resist happiness. - Don't quote some book and try to analyze... - You don't resist happiness? Are you trying to illustrate your point by making me unhappy? You're a good woman. Jesus. Have I become that dull? (SIGHS) Try and write something today. Good plan, Batman. (SIGHS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH ON RADIO) (BOTH WHISPERING IN FRENCH) (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) (WOMAN MOANING) (MOANING INTENSIFIES) (EXHALES) (WATER RUNNING) - (SPITS) - (TURNS WATER OFF) ROLAND: You had a tough night? - I don't know. - Ness? Right. Are we ever gonna talk about it? I suppose it's best we don't say a word. (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) (GLASS CLATTERS) Shit. Uh... sorry. I got it. I got it. It's okay. (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) What the fuck? (SCOFFS) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) Come on. Come on. (BOTH CONTINUE IN FRENCH) ROLAND: Fucking shit. - Hey, I'm going. I'm going. - (SPEAKING FRENCH) All right? This place is shit anyways. - (DOOR OPENS) - (BELL JINGLES) (ROLAND SPEAKING FRENCH) (SLAMS DOOR) (SIGHS) (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH) Vanessa. Hmm. - New York. - American? Hmm. We talked about having our honeymoon in New York. Yeah, my wife and I, we... We just got married. That's nice. Hmm. Well, have a nice day. And you. - (WOMAN LAUGHING) - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (CHUCKLES) (SCOFFS DISMISSIVELY) Toast of New York. (BOTH CONTINUE IN FRENCH) Hmm. Ooh-la-la. (SIGHS DEEPLY) (SCOFFS) (CHUCKLES) (INAUDIBLE) (DOOR CLOSES) You're back early. I missed you. Don't be silly. Drink? Sure. Have you seen her? - Who? - The neighbor. - The couple? - Hmm. Yeah. What? Nothing. Anyway, I was getting bored. It's not the place. The place hasn't let me down. It's moi. Michel is such an interesting guy. He's... He's too kind. But he's heavy. Any writer worth his salt could get a story here. It's just me. I'm blowing you a kiss. I'm blowing you one back. (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (WOMAN LAUGHING) (COUPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY) - (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH) (WATER RUNNING) (SIGHS) Wake up. Wake up. - Wake up! - What? - What? - Do you wanna fuck her? Huh? The woman next door, do you want to fuck her? Honey, what are you doing? Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Get off! And now you just woke me up. - Where are you going? - I gotta take a piss. You mind? (URINATING) (TOILET FLUSHING) Do you want to fuck her? Jesus Christ, no. Yes, you do. Honey, why are you doing this? Why are you trying to put that in my head? Huh? So you can be the victim? Being the wife of a failed writer is not good enough for pill-popping and self-pity? Now you need a better reason to destroy yourself? You know my reason. Plus, you would have to try and fail to be a failed writer, and you're nothing. You're a drunk. (SCOFFS) Fuck you. When I return, I hope you're passed out as usual, so I don't have to listen to your silly voice. (WHIMPERS) (CRYING) (GOAT BLEATING) - Bonjour. - Bonjour. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (GROANS) God damn it. (VOMITING, COUGHING) (GROANS) (TOILET FLUSHING) (SLURRING) Come on. No. - Stop it. Stop it. - Come on. - No. (GROANING) - Come on. (LAUGHS) Ugh! (LAUGHS) Ow! Stop it. (CONTINUES LAUGHING) (GROANING PLAYFULLY) You make me sick. Disgusting. I'm not gonna make it. WOMAN: Good morning. Morning. Did you see your fisherman this morning? Yes. Franois is going to visit a friend tomorrow. Do you wanna do anything? - With you? - Yeah. Like what? I don't know. We can play cards, go for a walk, get a drink. - I don't know how to play cards. - I can teach you. Okay. 5:00? - 8:00. - 8:00. Have a nice day. Bye. (WATER SPLASHING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Hi. - Come in. - Thank you. - Sit down. (DOOR CLOSES) - Pretty dress. - Oh, thank you. - You should put your hair up. - Oh... It's funny, my... my husband always say that. - He's right. - (CHUCKLES) So, do you know La Belote? La Belote, the game is to get the highest number of points. So let's say... I move everything here. How many? - VANESSA: Um, is it? - LEA: Yeah, yeah, you can do that. - VANESSA: More wine? - LEA: Four? Damn. - You won again. - (CHUCKLES) 11. - Okay. 10, king. - VANESSA: I'll take it. Hi. - Hi. - VANESSA: Belote. - LEA: Aw! Come on. - Rebelote. So unfair. (CHUCKLES) Hey. We haven't properly met. I see you at the caf often. I'm Lea. - Nice to meet you. I'm Roland. - Hi. Would you like a drink? Sure. LEA: So unfair. Do you wanna join us? Okay. And don't tell me you don't play cards, too. Your wife told me that, and then she's won every hand. - Well, she's a natural. - Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Oh, we can't play La Belote. It's not working if we are three. We have to change the game. Let's play... - La Bataille? - Yes. - Mmm. - LEA: Easy. What was that about? What do you mean? Nessa... Are you trying to push her on me? Am I wrong to think you're trying to destroy us? I'm gonna take a shower. (SHOWER RUNNING) - Jesus! What are you doing? - Tonight, I'm having a shower with my wife. No. No. - No. - Enough. It's gotta stop. - It's all right. It's all right. - No, I can't... It's just... - Vanessa, enough. - Please. - Stop! Stop! - No. Stop it! Stop! - Enough! - Please. I'm your husband. I can't. At some point you're gonna stop acting like this. (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) ROLAND: Merci. ROLAND: Are we ever gonna talk about it? (VANESSA LAUGHING) ROLAND: Nessa? Do you hate me? Do you hate me? Stop! Just stop! You resist happiness. Nessa? Ness? (SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSES) (EXHALES) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (BOTH LAUGHING) (DOOR OPENS) You're smiling. (BREATHING SHAKILY) Now my outsides match my insides. (MOANS SADLY) Stay. Stay. (DOOR CLOSES) ROLAND: Good morning. We were out of coffee. Why you looking at me like that? Just looking. (FRANOIS STRUMMING GUITAR) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (FRANOIS PLAYING ROCK MUSIC) (CAMERA CLICKING) (STOPS PLAYING) (LEA LAUGHS) - (HEART BEATING) - (LEA MOANS) (EXHALES) Hello. Hello. Did you go on your trip? Your wife said you went on a trip. It was okay. But I prefer to stay here. I grew up in a place like this, so I'm happy here. Mmm. We might have a big sailing day next week. And we don't really have any friends up here, so... would you and your husband consider coming? - Sailing? - Yes, sailing. Why not? It can be fun. And you can do the same thing you're doing now, - only on the sea. - (CHUCKLES) - I'll talk to my husband. - Sure. Good night. Good night. - VANESSA: Hi. - Hi. Thought I'd bring dinner home tonight. VANESSA: I'll get some plates. - Nessa? - Yeah? We okay? We are... the same as we've been for a long time. No different. Okay. They asked if we wanted to go sailing. How wonderful. And you said? I said we hate boats and we hate people. No, you didn't. I didn't, but we do. So we're not going, right? Do you wanna go? Why do I feel like that's a trick question? I just thought maybe an adventure would be good for us. Maybe, I don't know. You realize how shocking that is to hear you say that? But, yes, I would love something fun for us. (POURING) - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) - (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (MAN CHATTERING IN FRENCH ON TV) (LEA AND FRANOIS CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (FRANOIS LAUGHS) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) ROLAND: Were you watching them? What were they doing? I ask because I was here the other day while you were on a walk, and I noticed the hole, and I watched them... fucking. Does that bother you? Will you watch with me? (LEA MOANING) (LEA SPEAKING FRENCH) (LEA LAUGHING) (LEA GIGGLING) Do you wanna take a shower? Yes. - (VANESSA CRYING) - (SHOWER RUNNING) - ROLAND: Good morning. - VANESSA: Morning. We're out of milk. Will you get some when you go to work? You watch them in the morning? Sometimes. I think I might stay home today. Is that all right? Do you wanna be alone? No. Are we perverse? Would it bother you if we were? No. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) - Hey, neighbor. - Morning. It's our two-months anniversary. I was thinking of berries and cream. Maybe port? I don't know. - I guess it's the thought. - Yeah. When's yours? Winter. Winter? (CHUCKLES) (DOOR CLOSES) Were you with her? She was at the store. It's their anniversary. Ah. When's ours? November. Uh... End of November. Yeah. What day? ROLAND: 27, 20... Can't remember. Me neither. - Ness? - Mmm? It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean anything that we can't remember. Okay? They had fresh pastries. (VANESSA AND FRANOIS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) What did he want? - VANESSA: Who? - Franois. He wanted to know if we still wanted to go sailing. You're lying. He asked me for a cigarette. I started smoking when we got here, and you were here, so I said I was out. I know you started smoking. Did you? Yeah. I know you. (LEA AND FRANOIS CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (LEA GASPS) (BOTH LAUGHING) (BOTH CONTINUE CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (FRANCOIS CHUCKLING) (LEA GASPING) (MOANING) (BOTH MOANING) VANESSA: Do you see that fisherman? He goes out every day, comes back every night. Hardly catches any fish. What keeps him from going insane? From being so tired of it all? What is it we don't know? Let's go to the caf for a drink. Mmm... No. How about we invite our neighbors? Get them liquored up, and see what they do when they're plastered. - (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (ALL CONVERSING IN FRENCH) What would you like? - I heard pastis is good. - Pastis. Pastis. (CLINK) - Hey! - Hello. ALL: Bonsoir. Hello. ROLAND: This is Vanessa's first encounter with pastis. - (ALL EXCLAIMING) - Really? - And? - VANESSA: And I've had two. - Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. What did you think? I think you should have two. - LEA: (CHUCKLES) Oh. - FRANOIS: I'm not so sure. - ROLAND: Just takes a little practice. - Yeah? FRANOIS: I have some memories. (LAUGHING) So, Roland, Vanessa tells us you're a writer. - Uh, some days. - It's great. I wish I could write. Mmm. Well, I do, too, lately. - Hmm. - WAITER: Voil. - LEA: Oh-la-la. - (ALL LAUGHING) - What do you do, Franois? - Mmm, I just opened an art gallery in Paris. - ROLAND: Mmm. - It's your own gallery? FRANOIS: Yes. I was a dealer first. Art dealer, and then I opened a gallery. And hopefully, I have the help of my nice little wife. - So we work together. - (FRANOIS AND LEA LAUGHING) - Cheers. - Okay, cheers, everyone. LEA: Cheers. Mmm. - Mmm. - That's strong. - What do you do, Vanessa? - Me? - Absolutely nothing. - (BOTH GASP) LEA: You're a wife, like me. VANESSA: Mmm... Technically, yes. - But I'm not very good at that either. - That's not true. She's a fantastic wife. She's the best little homemaker in the world. Not funny? I used to be a dancer. - LEA: Oh. - Mmm. That's great. Why did you stop? Because I got old. - FRANOIS: But very beautiful. - (LEA CHUCKLES) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) Yes, yes. - I know this thing by heart. - VANESSA: New Yorkers do not eat pigeon. - We eat escargot, too. - FRANOIS: I think I want another drink. - We are strange. - VANESSA: You are strange. - All right. Four more pastis. - (ALL TOASTING) (GLASSES CLINKING) ROLAND: Dear Lord, that was painful. VANESSA: Let's hope it pays off. (DOOR CLOSES) (GROANS) (FRANOIS SPEAKING FRENCH) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (POURING) (STRUMS GUITAR) Well, now we know. They're miserable drunks. (SIGHS) (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) Isn't this just everything? - My first time. - Really? Well, you're a natural. (INDISTINCT) Can you hold it for me? (INDISTINCT) (LEA LAUGHING) (ALL LAUGHING) You look beautiful laying there. Maybe I don't say that enough. It's difficult, because it makes me wanna be with you. And I know how hard it is for you to be with me. Only, don't begin to think he sees you any differently than I do. Of course he does. He doesn't know me. Is that what you want? To be unknown by someone? Maybe. Do you want him? Do you want her? - No. - But you like to watch her. I like to watch with you, honey. Makes me wanna be with you. I think of you. I don't think I like this game anymore. VANESSA: Roly? What are they doing? Nessa... Please? ROLAND: They're laying on the bed. She's reading a book. He's watching her. His hands move down her body. To her thighs. Between her legs. He wants her... but he's waiting. Waiting for her to let him know it's all right. (GASPS) He loves the way she feels. He wants her to know how desirable she is. (MOANING) And to feel how she desires him. How desirable she is. (BOTH MOANING) See you later. Okay. (DOOR CLOSES) (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (MICHEL SPEAKING FRENCH) Hey. Mmm. Feels strange not to talk. - No, it doesn't. - (CHUCKLES) Are you working? No. - You're writing something? - Just drinking. I see. They told me who you are. I've read your books. - Have you? - Mmm-hmm. I think I like the first one best. I guess everybody did. - Everyone did. - (BOTH CHUCKLE) Yes. Everyone has many opinions. How do you like being married? Yeah, I love it. Why? What do you mean, "Why?" Why? (EXHALES) I like belonging to something. To someone. I like knowing what my life is gonna be. What? (CHUCKLES) You think I'm naive? I think you're a woman. I think you're lovely... and I hope your life turns out just as you imagine. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (FRANOIS AND VANESSA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Wanna go for a drive? I thought we agreed we weren't going anywhere until you wrote. The rate I'm going... Let's go for a drive. (FRENCH MUSIC PLAYING) I'd like to stop at a church. Okay. I prayed... (SNIFFLING) that God might forgive me for all the horrible things I said when we knew. (SIGHS) And I prayed for the strength to mean it. Because I don't. I'm angry. I'm angry, too, baby. - VANESSA: Where are we? - I'm taking you to dinner. I'm not dressed for dinner. Just do this for me. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH) - I don't wanna be here. - It's all right, honey. Just look at me. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Merci. (PLAYING SLOW MUSIC) Dance with me. (ECHOING) Honey? Ness? Vanessa? ROLAND: I think I wanna write about you. I'll change the name. So what? So what if they know? Honey, I would never write about that. (LEA SPEAKING FRENCH) VANESSA: I was thinking maybe I'd get dressed and go for a walk. I'll go with you. I was gonna smoke. I won't stop you. I'll just go on the balcony. (FAINT MOANING) Going somewhere? VANESSA: I'm taking Lea shopping. - It's my good deed for the month. - (CLICKING LIGHTER) Why the sudden change of heart? I needed a pair of shoes. (ENGINE STARTS) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) You good? LEA: Um... Yeah. (CHUCKLES) I look, um... I look different. You want to see? VANESSA: Yes. - (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) - (LAUGHING) - Hey, Roland. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. - That's a nice jacket. - Oh, yeah, you like it? My missus bought it for me. I guess our girls had a bit of a spend-up. Yes. - And Lea told me about your car. - Oh, the car is great. Yeah, that's a great car. My uncle has the same, actually. - It's nice. It's a nice car. - Yeah. All right. Have a good evening. LEA: Bye. (ICE CUBES CLINKING) (POURING) You dressed him like me. I had that jacket when we met. Did they look nice? - Did they look nice? - You dressed him like me. What are you doing, honey? What are you doing? - (MUTTERS) - Nessa. Help me understand. What are you doing? What is this? - Would you close the door? - What are you doing? Would you close the door? There's a draft. What is this? (VANESSA CRYING) (DOOR CLOSING) ROLAND: I think we should stop watching them. We don't need them anymore. We have our life. We have each other. Let's let them have theirs. Honey? - Ness. - (DOOR OPENING) (VANESSA AND FRANOIS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) You're home early. Mmm-hmm. Do you want a drink? I didn't know you liked cards so much. That's nice. Cards are fun. It's a good game. I like cards. Do you want a drink? No. No, I don't want a fucking drink. I wanna know what this is. Do you wanna hurt me? Hmm? - No. - Hurt me. - No, I don't wanna hurt you. - Just do it. Hurt me. - Get it over with. Go ahead. - No. I would never hurt you. Stop, please. - It's all right. Do it. - Stop it. - Wanna hurt me? Get it over with. - Stop! - Go on. It's easy. - I don't wanna hurt you. - Just do it. - Stop! - Come on! Do it. - Please, stop. Stop! - Stop! I don't know what's happening. - You don't understand? - Stop! Stop. - Come on, do it. No! Let's just... Can we get out of here? Can we get out of here? Could we just go? Let's just go. Let's get out of this room. Please? (CRYING) - Please. - (SOFTLY) Okay. I don't wanna... I'll get my jacket. (CONTINUES CRYING) (GROANS) - (LAUGHTER) - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH) (CHUCKLES) (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) FRANOIS: May I? (DOOR OPENS) FRANOIS: No. Wait, wait! (FRANOIS GROANING) (GASPS) Come on. Why? Why? - (BREATHING HEAVILY) - Why? Say it. Why? - Look at me. Look at me! - No! (WHIMPERS) - Why? - Stop. You know why. Be honest. Say it. Say it. Come on. Look at me. Why? - Because you can't have what they have. - No. (CRYING) - Say it. - No. Because you can't have what they have. Because you're jealous. - No! No! - You're sick! - You're sick. - (SOBBING) You would ruin them to make yourself feel better. You wanna hurt them. - No! I wanted him! - Yes. No! No! No. - You're jealous because you're barren. - No. You hate them. You hate them! - Say it! - (YELLS) - You hate them. - (CRYING) You're jealous. You hate them... because you're barren. And I've loved you anyways. You don't want him. You want me. You want children with me. You don't want him. You love me. - Say it. - I'm barren. I'm barren. (SOBBING) (LEA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) She's home. (LEA AND FRANOIS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) He's... he's trying to say something. - Wait. - (LEA AND FRANOIS ARGUING) He's telling her the truth. She won't let him touch her. (DOOR SLAMS) Well done, darling. It seems you've just destroyed a happy marriage. Could I speak with you for a moment? I don't wanna speak to you. It's not what you think it is. (SOBBING) ROLAND: This is something that started three years ago, when we first tried to have a child. We lost that child in the first term... so we tried again. We lost that baby, too. They said they were going to try and fight past it. That going through something horrible could even make them stronger. She's pregnant. I assume you knew that. I'm not a bad person. Am I a bad person? Sometimes. (SNIFFLES) We gotta stop being such assholes. (CHUCKLES) (ROLAND TYPING) ROLAND: I figured out your fisherman. He goes with the tide. You let it pull you out to sea or guide you back in. Sometimes you have to move with it. Sometimes, honey, that's all we can do. (CONVERSING IN FRENCH)
