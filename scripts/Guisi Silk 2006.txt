Here. On the top floor. If there really are ghosts. I wouldn't mind catching one and take a look myself. That's exactly what we are trying to do. Film with Menger Sponge coating? Japanese government spending a lot of money on this project. Everything the same as before? Or you have any special requirement? Same as before. Exposed for 15 seconds at a time. No flash, and only around the furniture once every hour. Yeah right, same as before. Nothing. What the hell? Secure the area immediately. Evacuate everyone from the building. Mr. Hashimoto. How about the authorities? Authorities? What authorities! JAPANESE SCIENTIST INVENTS MENGER SPONGE: A BLACK HOLE FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE WALKING ON CEILING IS POSSIBLE JAPANESE SCIENTIST HASHIMOTO LARGE-SCALE MENGER SPONGE IS THE KEY TO ANTI-GRAVITY EFFEC ANTI-GRAVITY RESEARCH GROUP FOUNDED WITH MEMBERS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SU. 28. CHINESE. REN. 24. MALAYSIAN-CHINESE. MEI. 23. TAIWANESE. DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE-SCALE MENGER SPONGE FAILED SCIENTIST'S DREAM SHATTERED The apartment which contains high radioactive contaminants... discovered by inspectors last week has been evacuated of residents... but as of today, no resident relocation plan is in place... Miss? When did you receive notification? Miss. Radioactive contaminated residence has been the job... of the Urban Development Commission and the Atomic Energy Bureau. However, the emergency evacuation mandates... was approved and signed by the Foreign Affairs Division... which makes the evacuation an odd move. Questions regarding this evacuation have not been answered. One statement to warn the public not to enter the area... You used the Bureau's name... to request the Taiwanese Office of the President to evacuate a building? And the reason is confidential matter regarding... the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation & Security... between the U.S. and Japan? You've been wasting the government's money. How many foreign consultants have died?! This is my reason. Large-scale Menger Sponge? Not yet. It's the only one in the world. Don't forget. It belongs to the government. If you give me more time. I guarantee you. I will be able to talk to you standing straight on the ceiling. - I need one more favor. - What? Taiwan Joint Crime Crackdown Unit Yeh Qi Tung. To move someone from the JCCU. We'll need authorization from Central and Military Intelligence. You can do it. Why him? What's so special about him? He can see the feathers on a flying bird. Every individual face on a speeding bus. He can see everything clearly. Not only does he have sharp eyesight but he can also read lips. Fine, I'll help you one last time. If you make one more mistake... your crippled leg will go back to Japan teaching high school physics! Team, 3rd Floor Flat C. Under Control. 4th floor status? On Alert. We found the hostage in 3rd Floor Flat C! Evacuate the building. Get the bomb squad! Tung, hostage found, but no sign of any suspects. All hands to 4th Floor, Left Wing. Clear the hallways. Attach Unit Ready! Bomb Squad Ready! 3rd floor secured, 4th floor secured. Bomb Squad Ready. Tung, where is the target? Still drinking coffee. Anti-Tank Mine C4. Closed-Circuit Wiring. Remote Access Detonator. Can you dismantle it? There's a code for the activator. Can you decode it? It has a 12 digit code, practically impossible. Try your best. - Set up a bypass. - Do it. Secure the target and get the code. Copy that. Hello. Police? Police. When did this happen? Are you still there? Chiu, somebody informed him. He knows. Bypass ready. You'll be fine hiding there. I'm going to give you the code. Detonate the bomb. He's going to detonate the bomb. The detonator is inside the room. Find that person now! U team standby. A team move. Activate. Listen carefully. What is the code? We need the code. First set of numbers is... Second set of numbers... - 508. - 508. - 012. - 012. Last set. What's the last set of code numbers? What's the last set? Last set of numbers is 179. What's the last number? Dad? Dad? Secure the scene. Clear the building! Give the phone back to me. I want to talk to my Dad. Take away the kid. Dad, where are you? Dad! For your mother's seizure attack... we had to use four times the regular doze to keep her stable. She is suffering. Her muscular and neural stems are deteriorating. She could fall into a coma at any moment. If the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale is below 4... next of kin have the right to disconnect the life support system. Dr. Ma. My mom won't die. - Hello? - Hello Wei. Tung, you are early today. You don't have to work? I was assigned to a new unit. I like to buy some flowers for my mom. Sounds good. What kind of flowers would you like? Choose for me. Can you have them delivered to the hospital? Sure. Tung. Are you free tonight? Do you want to go to a concert with me? I have two spare tickets. The nurse is not available tonight. I need to be there with my mom tonight. Okay. I will go with my sister. Thanks for the flowers. You are welcome. The 4th floor. There's no contamination. DO NOT ENTER Anti-Gravity Unit? Doesn't look like it right? You see? Put up a sign and we have our new headquarter. Why did you ask for me? Would you like coffee or tea? What do you want from me? Coffee? Wait. My name is Hashimoto. I'm in charge of this team. The main mission of this team is to find a way to achieve anti-gravity. We have tried for four years. - Anti-gravity is impossible. - Really? Do you believe ghosts exist in this world? Follow me. Hashimoto. Are you sure you want to tell him? I'm sure. There is no one in there, right? It's just eye drops. Like this. Pay attention to his hand. It seems that he likes apples. Perhaps he is full now. What's he saying? It's raining. He says, "it's raining." Raining? No reaction to sound and image. Can't see. Can't hear. Can't haunt people. Not what you imagined. This is definitely a world first. We've caught the world's first ghost! Why can I see it? This is the Menger Sponge. It's made out of human protein. It can capture different electromagnetic wavelengths. Ghost is just a form of energy. When the Menger Sponge absorbs enough energy it can defy gravity. Electromagnetic wave is a form of energy. We sprayed a thin layer of microscopic Menger Sponge on your eyes. It acts like a lens filter... giving you ability to see images at different wavelengths. It's 4:30 p.m. He wants to go out at this time every day. That's an instinctive reaction. The whole room is covered with Menger Sponge. Even the door knob. The Menger Sponge absorbs any energy... so he's afraid of going out. So you've caught a ghost. But why am I here? I want you to find out who he is... when he died... why he died... and where his body is buried? I refuse to take the job. Find someone else. Answer me. You don't know what to say because you have no reason to refuse. What about your mother? What are you going to do with her? Do you have the right to keep her alive like that? How do you know she doesn't want to die? Am I wrong? How do you know that dying isn't better than living? Let me remind you. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is hereditary. Don't bring my mother into this. Aren't you going to the concert? My little sister went to the concert, so there's no one to deliver the flowers. And I want to visit your mom. So I came instead. Thanks. And you? How was your day? Nothing special. How is she doing? Not bad. We had a long talk mostly about you. My mom's been like this for a while. She can't talk. When girls talk we don't always have to speak. So what did she tell you? It's a secret. Did mom say she hates me? Because these past few years, I've let her suffer. Tung. Did she ask you why I'm torturing her like this? Did she say she just wants to die so that she can escape from this pain? Tung. She's your mother. What do you want her to say? Tell you that "I've ruined your life?" "Let me go." "Let me go so that you can be free." Is that what you want? What she really wants to say is... she wants you to be happy. I'm leaving. I still love her. No. I don't think she would accept. If she says yes... will you open your eyes? Run! Wait for me! I've interviewed all the past residents and the police. Store owners and teachers in the area. Even the breakfast vendor. Nobody knows him. Good morning. Here is the coffee. - What about the landlord? - Landlord? The landlord died 3 years ago His descendants live overseas. Even so this place has gone through a dozen owners and residents. No one knows the kid. He's talking again. What is he saying? The window is broken. He said, "the window is broken." You've come to work. Hashimoto! Let him do it. He's the expert. Before I get started, there's something I need to know. Is he dangerous? What do you mean? Ghosts in horror films usually kill. If you're scared then leave. Su. Am I wrong? It's just following a kid. Anyone can do it. You haven't answered my question. There was a foreigner who spent one night with him and died. His name is James Carmen, Canadian, 45-year-old. He's hired as photographer. How did you know where to send him? Wherever there are rumors of ghosts, we send him. We've send him to Japan, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and London. Ends up we find one right here in Taipei. If it wasn't heart failure... could he have been scared to death? It's not that easy to be scared to death. Do we need to magnify it on the computer? No. What are you doing? Hey! What exactly are you doing? The body has already been examined. I want to take a look at his heart. Look. If this is the thumb... and these are the other four fingers... looking at the size, doesn't it look like a child's hand? It does. Su. What are you doing? That night... after looking at this picture... the photographer must have felt strange. Why is there a child? So... He turned. Looked at that corner. Could it be... that the child doesn't like to be stared at? Su. Where is the child? I let him go. This research means too much to you. You won't let him go. You know this, why are you stopping me? I wasted four years of my life, with a cripple like you. We finally gave some results. And you bring in an outsider! I don't want to argue with you. Where is the child? I don't know. Let me out! Why is Su inside? Where's the child? What? What are you saying? What are you talking about? Su. We can let you out. But you need to take off your clothes. What do you mean? Open up your coat. Want to see more? Is this enough? The child is a form of energy. Energy can expand and shrink. You sprayed Menger Sponge on the newspaper... and wrapped the kid in your pocket. Didn't you? Let's see your pockets. He's gone. Su. Listen to me, don't move. - What's wrong? - Listen carefully. Whatever you do, don't turn your head to the left. Do not turn your head. Why can't I turn left? That strand of silk! Where? - What're you talking about? - Did you see that? I No. His hand. His hand is solidifying. Hurry! Open the door Hurry! When you die... your energy can only last for a short period. And then it disappears forever. No matter how much you love the world... or how much the world loves you. Why doesn't he disappear? I want you to find the answer. Mom! Mom... Mom, do you really want to go? To be free? Precisely on time. It's 4:30 p.m. The eye drop from this bottle will last the whole day... but bring another one, just in case. I've saved all our numbers inside. Keep in touch. Why are you bringing a gun? Stop! Stop! Are you crazy? This is dangerous. Do you want to die? He was waiting to take this bus. Does it mean he's conscious? No. We call this Inertia. Inertia? Yes. He's just repeating the daily routine of his old life. Even though he is dead... his energy keeps on living the patterns of his previous life. CHILD - SU SILK Silk is the connection between two energies. Hey, ticket? CHI LI SCHOOL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION Check out Chi Li School of Special Education. He might have studied here. GRADE 3 CLASS 6 STUDENT PICK-UP AREA Mom. The daylilies are in bloom. Daylilies? Daylilies? No one will ever pick him up again. Does he get hungry? Does he have to eat? No. He doesn't need to eat. But we don't know where he gets his energy either. Why ask? Because I am hungry. One order please. I'm getting something to eat. Want anything? - I'll go sign in first, be right back. - Okay. Now we know which school he went to, finding out who he is should be easy. And next we're going to find out how he became a ghost. Why is it important to you how he became a ghost? Only someone who understands death can truly confront death. ENERGY, FACIAL DISORDER, HATRED, BURIAL LOCATION? Damn it! Ren! - What's going on? - He raised his hands! He's about to attack someone. What should I do? Try to distract him. How? - How? - I don't know! Spray your bullets with Menger Sponge and shoot him. You! Get out of there! Hurry! Don't move! Drop your gun! Drop it! How dare you shot a police! No matter what, don't look into his eyes. He'll see you if you look at him. You shot a police! Drop your gun! Now! - Cuff him. - Drop your gun! Get down. Get down. He's back! Don't you think he's wonderful? He will never grow old and die. He is free from agony. Don't have any responsibilities. No puberty, no peer pressure. Don't have to worry about college. Don't have to work, pay taxes, or find parking. Free from sexual desire. Please excuse us. See you. I envy you. It's all too difficult living. Director, there's been an accident. It can't be Hashimoto again. There was a shootout in the city. Two civilians and a police officer were wounded. Tung was the one who fired the gun. Hashimoto forged your name to bail Tung out. The Foreign Affairs Office just called. They want you to call them back immediately. Hot Shot. Someone issued national documents to bail you out. Who are you? The President must be your father. Sign your name, and you can go. Let's go. We need to find out where the child's buried. Don't you ever get any rest? After I'm dead, I'll have plenty of time to rest. Do you have any recollection of him? Did he jump off the building? How did you know? His name is Yao. In the history of our school... he's the only one who's tried to suicide. Our school specializes in disabled students. Yao was stricken with something called Multiple Tumors Syndrome. It caused tiny tumors to erupt around his chest and neck area. Even after surgery the tumors kept recurring. Is that the reason he jumped? His tumors began to move to his face. He couldn't stand the other kids laughing at him. His mother's name is Chun? Actually, the day Yao jumped, his mother was also here. I remember she was a very skinny woman with long hair. That day. She was standing right there. Are you out of your mind? A few months later... Chun sneaked her son out of the hospital at night. No one's ever heard from them since. We suspect... You suspect that Chun murdered her only child. Some people said she went back to her hometown. Her family have a field of flowers in the mountains near Taipei. Are they daylilies flowers? I don't know. This is the only daylily field near Taipei. Why do you believe the body is buried here? It's just a hunch. - Hashimoto. - Director. I've warned you more than once. No accidents, no deaths. Now, two citizens and a police officer wounded. You're fired. I want your team shut down right now. Director, listen to me. I don't want to hear another word from you cripple. Hand over the Menger Sponge now. Bring Hashimoto in. RESTRICTED AREA NATIONAL RADIATION SYNCHRONIZATION CENTER You sure you want to do this? Don't worry, Hashimoto will take the blame. There they are. DANGER: HIGH MAGNETIC FLUX We can't reach him on his cellphone. You're the only person he wrote down as a contact person. How's his mom doing? She's got a blood clot in her brain. A very serious blood clot. Doctor, what can we do? If we go into surgery now, there's a 15% chance of success. If we don't, she won't make it through the night. We need a family member to sign the release form. It has to be direct family. He doesn't have any other family. - Are we really going to dig? - Of course. But we need to know where to start. Right over there. Joint Crime Crack-Down Unit Extension 107... Yeh Qi Tung is unable to answer the phone. For operator, please press one. He was choked to death. By his mother? It's possible. Murdered by his own mother... he must have died with very strong feelings of hate. Mom. Look! The daylilies are blooming. My teacher says... that the daylily is the flower of mother and son. Son. Mommy doesn't want you to live in pain. I don't want to see you... looked down upon by the whole world. I'll take all the blame and suffering. Let me help you find a way out. Thank you mommy. How did you know the body would be here? That's the National Radiation It's covering the whole hillside. The center is encircled by an electron accelerator. The violent magnetic field created by the accelerator... is the source of the ghost's endless energy. This spot is the very center of the magnetic field. I finally know... how to become a ghost. You promised me. If we humans have rights, ghosts should have rights too. Do you agree? You've unlocked the secret... it's time to isolate him forever. What's wrong? Don't do anything until I get back. Hello. Looking for Tung? Hi, is he here? He went out. You'll have to wait for him. Is everything alright? It is about his mother. PROVINCIAL DEEP COMATOSE STATE PATIENT CARE CENTER ZHENG CHUN Who are you? Give her with adrenaline now. Tung's girlfriend? I know. She's hot! Is that the only way you look at girls? I'm hungry. Wanna go grab some beef noodles later? I don't eat beef. - Why not? - Religious belief. My mom says that if you eat beef you'll go to hell. Look at him. Do you still believe in hell? Never seen him like this before. What's happening to him? It's 10:55 p.m. I officially announce the death of patient Chun. You. Follow me. Hashimoto. Ren. Sorry it's best if you leave now. I'll tell Tung you came by. The big earthquake few years ago... she was found crushed under a building. She wasn't rescued until 16 days later. We thought it was strange as well. No one can survive under those circumstances. When we checked her heart... we found as if... someone had been massaging her heart to keep her alive. It's very hard to explain. What is that? It's better if you don't know. He said, "the window is broken." She can communicate with her son. What are you doing? Where's Hashimoto? Hashimoto? Hashimoto? Mei, what happened to the signal? We've been shut down. The project is dead. - Where's Hashimoto? - I don't know. He disappeared suddenly. I think he left with the child. By the way, your girlfriend came by looking for you. Wei was looking for me? I think it had something to do with your mother. Mei. Why did Hashimoto take the child? You know, Hashimoto has diabetes. He already lost one leg. The other is not looking good. If he had the kid, even without both legs he could-- I'm going to eat beef noodles. Want to come? No. I'm going to clean up and go home. OK, I am leaving. - Bye - Bye. Where could she go? One super-sized bowl of beef noodles. Hashimoto. Hashimoto? Hashimoto. Hashimoto. Here. Beef noodles. Enjoy it. I've found Yao's mother. I know. You know? I can see that strand of silk. You can see it? To be exact... - that silk is a strand of hate. - What are you talking about? Yao became a ghost because of hatred. It was also out of hatred that he killed Su. You knew this all along? - Where's the child? - Your task is over. It's not over until you hand over the child. Tung. Go see your girlfriend. If you go now you might get to say your last words to her. What did you say? Hashimoto. Hashimoto. What the hell? Who ever heard of dying from eating noodles? Hello? Mei. I know why Hashimoto took the child?! What's going on? - Quick! Get out! - Why? I don't have time to explain. Did you hear me? Mei? Mei! Director... Director. Director. Director. Director. Director. You want to know... what it takes to stand on the ceiling like this and talk to you? What does it take? Well, first you have to have a strong sense of hate. Next, you have to want to die. Finally, you have to die in the right place. Since I was a child, living has never had much meaning for me. I've wanted to die every day. Now I know the location of where I should die. The only thing I'm not sure of is if I have enough hate. That's why I came looking for you. Do you understand? Now I just want to make sure I have enough hate toward you. - Wait. - You see this? A total of 744 times. Every time you called me a cripple. I pressed the button on this counter. Tung. Wei, don't say a word and listen. Wei, do you trust me? Yes. Okay. Do what I tell you. Don't move and don't ask any questions. Now take a step to your left. A little more. Good. Stop. Now close your eyes. Listen carefully. No matter what you hear and no matter what happens... don't open your eyes. Yes. - Tung. - Don't be afraid. Trust me. Hashimoto. Where are you? I'm walking on the path towards eternal release. Mei is dead. Yao's mother killed her. Listen to me. Chun is searching for her son. You have to let Yao go. Tung. Everyone will eventually die. It is important that... at that moment to taste death and experience it completely. Don't run away from it. Let the child go! If you know how peaceful and beautiful the afterlife really is... you wouldn't say that. Tung. I'll see you in the next life. Hashimoto. Hashimoto. Shit! Get out! I don't have to ever envy you again. So this is what I'll look like when I die. Tung. Yes, it's me. What is going on? It's very difficult to explain right now. Are you okay? How about you? Are you okay? Not bad. Same as usual. This afternoon... your mom went into surgery to remove a blood clot in her brain. The doctor said tonight is critical. I know that you can't let go of your mother. She means the world to you. But if she leaves, you'll have to face your own life. What will you do then? Both your mom and I, we all want you to live happily. Wei. I have a favor to ask of you. Will you please see my mother tomorrow? And tell her... that I just want her to live on. Ask her not to hate me. And ask her not to forget that she had a son in this world. Tung. Tung. I just want to go on living with you... and really enjoy each day. I love you, but that doesn't make you happy. Want to be alive. Want to be happy. Want life to change. And see you every morning. Here is the release paper. Take care of yourself. Mom. She said yes. Isn't it time for you to open your eyes? SURGERY RELEASE SIGNED BY DU WEI RELATION: DAUGHTER-IN-LAW Mom. Do you hate me? Is that why you don't want to leave? Mom. Hashimoto. I want to thank you. You have helped me understand life. I wonder if hate can live forever and release us from suffering. Yao's spirit did not remain because of hatred... not because of where he lied in the daylily field. It was the love between mother and son. I call to tell you that I am resigning. I will enjoy what life has for me. No matter where you are. I wish you well.
