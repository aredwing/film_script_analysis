I used to play it all the time with my father. 1215 01:40:17,211 -- 01:40:20,442 I doubt that you played Russian roulette all the time with your father. 1216 01:40:20,547 -- 01:40:23,448 I most certainly did. You play it with two packs of cards, and - 1217 01:40:23,550 -- 01:40:26,246 That is Russian bank. Russian roulette's a very different amusement... 1218 01:40:26,353 -- 01:40:29,516 which I can only wish your father had played continuously before he had you. 1219 01:40:29,623 -- 01:40:32,421 - Where are the - - Oh, Alfred, what is the matter with you? 1220 01:40:32,526 -- 01:40:34,551 You're acting like a crocodile with a toothache. 1221 01:40:34,661 -- 01:40:37,129 - Where are the bullets for my revolver? - I don't know. 1222 01:40:37,231 -- 01:40:39,495 You never seem to be able to find anything. 1223 01:40:40,834 -- 01:40:44,167 Why don't you call Tony and ask him? He's supposed to look after your things. 1224 01:40:44,271 -- 01:40:46,171 And how he does. What devotion. 1225 01:40:46,273 -- 01:40:49,709 And how you've thanked him for it tonight. Honestly, Alfred, of all the boors - 1226 01:40:49,810 -- 01:40:54,770 -Just give me one reason why I should thank him, and I'll call him at once. - Well, I wish you would. 1227 01:40:54,882 -- 01:40:57,146 - What's his room number? - 3406. 1228 01:40:57,251 -- 01:40:59,446 - How'd you know that? - Why shouldn't I know it? 1229 01:40:59,553 -- 01:41:02,488 He's your secretary, isn't he? I must have called him 9,000 times. 1230 01:41:02,589 -- 01:41:05,387 - But you've never been there? - Yes, I have. 1231 01:41:05,492 -- 01:41:08,757 - When, may I ask? - I don't think I want to tell you that. 1232 01:41:08,862 -- 01:41:11,956 - I shouldn't think you would. - Because it's really my problem. I - 1233 01:41:12,066 -- 01:41:15,035 - Well, unless you want to help me with it. - I shall be charmed! 1234 01:41:15,135 -- 01:41:17,035 You don't look very charmed. 1235 01:41:17,137 -- 01:41:19,697 - It happened while you were in England. - Naturally. 1236 01:41:19,807 -- 01:41:22,833 He called me up one night, about 1 :30, to find out if Barbara was here... 1237 01:41:22,943 -- 01:41:25,104 because she'd told him that she was - but she wasn't. 1238 01:41:25,212 -- 01:41:27,703 - How was that his business? - He's married to her, isn't he? 1239 01:41:27,815 -- 01:41:29,715 - Who is married to who? - August. 1240 01:41:29,817 -- 01:41:32,980 - Don't try and change the subject. We're not - - I'm not trying to change the subject. 1241 01:41:33,087 -- 01:41:36,113 I'm trying to tell you August called me here to find out if Barbara was with me... 1242 01:41:36,223 -- 01:41:38,214 because she told him she was - only she wasn't. 1243 01:41:38,325 -- 01:41:40,657 - Who cares where Barbara is? - August, I suppose. 1244 01:41:40,761 -- 01:41:43,321 - Oh, very well. Where was she? - Well, I had this - 1245 01:41:43,430 -- 01:41:45,625 this awful suspicion that I didn't want to have. 1246 01:41:45,732 -- 01:41:49,691 After all, she is my kid sister, and I always hoped that when she said those things about August... 1247 01:41:49,803 -- 01:41:52,499 - that she was just trying to be funny. - It wouldn't be very difficult. 1248 01:41:52,606 -- 01:41:54,938 Anyway, I didn't dare tell August that she wasn't here... 1249 01:41:55,042 -- 01:41:57,237 and I didn't dare call her where I thought she was... 1250 01:41:57,344 -- 01:41:59,539 because the kind of a man who checks up on his wife... 1251 01:41:59,646 -- 01:42:02,945 is the kind of a man who hires detectives to help him and has telephones tapped. 1252 01:42:03,050 -- 01:42:05,416 You're describing August down to the last moth in his wallet. 1253 01:42:05,519 -- 01:42:08,386 Anyway, I told him that she had been here with me and had just left. 1254 01:42:08,489 -- 01:42:11,049 Then I threw on a negligee and hurried down there,just in case. 1255 01:42:11,158 -- 01:42:13,592 - Hurried down where? - To 3406. 1256 01:42:13,694 -- 01:42:15,924 3406. 1257 01:42:16,029 -- 01:42:17,929 3406! Of course! 1258 01:42:18,031 -- 01:42:19,999 Well, of course, since that's Tony's room. 1259 01:42:20,100 -- 01:42:24,127 The door was open a little, so I marched right in ready to give her a piece of my mind... 1260 01:42:24,238 -- 01:42:27,332 but there wasn't anybody there, which certainly made me feel a lot better... 1261 01:42:27,441 -- 01:42:30,274 and I started to leave a lot happier than I had felt when I arrived. 1262 01:42:30,377 -- 01:42:34,040 Then I suddenly realized how terrible it would look if anybody saw me coming out of that room. 1263 01:42:34,148 -- 01:42:36,048 Because Tony's about my age and - 1264 01:42:36,150 -- 01:42:39,278 To anybody who didn't understand how you and I feel about each other, it would look- 1265 01:42:39,386 -- 01:42:41,445 - Well, you know how dumb some people are. - Do I. 1266 01:42:41,555 -- 01:42:44,046 Just before I opened the door I peeked through the keyhole... 1267 01:42:44,158 -- 01:42:48,595 and right there, near the freight elevator, I saw this great big old jerk squinting around the corner. 1268 01:42:48,695 -- 01:42:51,926 - A large lumpy man with a face like an orangutan? - Right. Like a gorilla. 1269 01:42:52,032 -- 01:42:55,661 - Sweeney, the detective! August's detective! - That's what I was afraid of. 1270 01:42:55,769 -- 01:42:57,964 Anyway, he stood there, and so I waited... 1271 01:42:58,071 -- 01:42:59,971 and he waited and we waited - 1272 01:43:00,073 -- 01:43:02,337 For 38 minutes! He kept you there himself! 1273 01:43:02,442 -- 01:43:04,410 Well, it felt more like 38 years. 1274 01:43:04,511 -- 01:43:08,675 Why, I actually began to feel guilty. I'd never been in a man's room before - except yours. 1275 01:43:08,782 -- 01:43:11,546 You wonderful, wonderful, wonderful child. 1276 01:43:11,652 -- 01:43:15,110 - Why?
