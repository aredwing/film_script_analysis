I'm at home, it's Friday, gonna be in Los Angeles tomorrow to start the album, so I'll see you there! Anyways John, gimme a call. Here we go! Well, we wrote a big chunk of songs, and even throughout the process of that we kinda knew that we needed to raise the bar, and it was just a matter of it happening, and when Billy wrote American Idiot, it was like "Wow, this far supersedes everything we've been doing, "this is the level we should be writing towards." And when we hit that, we decided to not push ourselves to write this thing too fast, or anything like that, kinda let it go, and it kinda ended up getting this serious arc to it, and have all the energy, and creativity and inspiration that something like either Dookie or Nimrod had for us and so really, it was kinda obvious that this was what we needed to be doing. And that was the first day of our recordings. -On American Idiot, day one -Day one! -Is it time yet? Is it 12? No not yet, it's only fuckin' like 11 o'clock. -It's almost papi's birthday. -Oh, oh! -No way! It's my birthday?! -Almost, not yet. 32.. 32, a virgin, never been kissed! Man, I can't even believe that you missed the fire. -Thanks -Me and Trey sat there and we looked at each other like ready to record, I looked at him, he looked at me, I looked over and there was like a tube of smoke and it was just starting to come up. Billow, billow, billow, billow. -Oh, so you guys set the fire? No, no, no, no, we never set a fire. -Oh shit! Dude, electrical! -Fire, fire! -Fire extinguisher! -It's in the wall, right here! -Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! It's our first day of recording. It's the one that goes down in the books! Well, see you guys later, I'm going back to the pool. Nope, not today, not today. -Print something before the place burns down! -Billy, what are they doing? They are um.. testing out different cabinet combinations. -Why? -So we can get the very best sound we possibly can out of the guitar. You know, it starts out with American Idiot and sort of broken off into 3 different sections. And it follows this Jesus of Suburbia character, he gets pretty disenfranchised with where he comes from and you know, hates his town, hates his family, hates his friends, and he leaves. And then he ends up going to the city. Where he then starts dealing with what true rebellion means. Like these are just so beefy, and then it goes into here and somehow it kind of like loses balls. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Fear Factor, who could take my xylophone playing the longest? -Oh, could you do a Sonic Youth xylophone song? Hold on, let me get the 2 notes that don't go together the most. # Everyone's so full of shit # # Born and raised by hypocrites # # Hearts recycled but never saved # # From the cradle to the grave # # We are the kids of war and peace # # From Anaheim to the middle east # # We are the stories and disciples # # Of the Jesus of suburbia # # Land of make believe # Oh keep going. Let's do I Don't Care If You Don't Care real fast. It's funny because we say "opera" "punk rock opera" people think Pavarotti and they think strings, you know a lot of melodies, a lot of singing, all this other stuff, but really it's just like playing.. it's almost like playing a Ramones set. No breaks. It's like shifting gears like 5 times, and playing 5 different punk rock songs. -This is a rock opera, a rock opera is.. -Why can't it be a punk rock opera? Punk rock.. well like.. punk ropera, punk ro.. Punk ropera.. punk opera. I just think when people hear it, and they're not.. don't really know it and they sit there expecting like a Green Day record they're gonna be like... "What did I just hear?" "Did I just hear what I think I just heard?" "Was that song.. How long was that fuckin' song?" -Or like "Does my stereo go any louder?" I hope so. I hope they fuckin' love it. Alright, from the top, ready! # I'm the son of rage and love # # The Jesus of Suburbia # # From the bible of none of the above # # On a steady diet of # # Soda pop and Ritalin # # No one ever died for my sins in hell # # As far as I can tell # # At least the ones I got away with # # And there's nothing wrong with me # # This is how I'm supposed to be # # In a land of make believe # # That don't believe in me # # Get my television fix # # Sitting on my crucifix # # The living room or my private womb # # While the Mom's and Brad's are away # # To fall in love and fall in debt # # To alcohol and cigarettes # # And Mary Jane # # To keep me insane # # Doing someone else's cocaine # # And there's nothing wrong with me # # This is how I'm supposed to be # # In a land of make believe # # That don't believe in me # # At the center of the Earth # # In the parking lot # # Of the 7-11 where I was taught # # The motto was just a lie # # It says home is where your heart is # # But what a shame # # 'Cause everyone's heart # # Doesn't beat the same # # It's beating out of time # # City of the dead # # At the end of another lost highway # # Signs misleading to nowhere # # City of the damned # # Lost children with dirty faces today # # No one really seems to care # # I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall # # Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall # # And so it seemed to confess # # It didn't say much # # But it only confirmed that # # The center of the earth # # Is the end of the world # # And I could really care less # # City of the dead # # At the end of another lost highway # # Signs misleading to nowhere # # City of the damned # # Lost children with dirty faces today # # No one really seems to care # # I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't # # I don't care if you don't care # # I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't # # I don't care if you don't care # # I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't # # I don't care if you don't care # # I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't # # I don't care if you don't care # # I don't care # # Everyone is so full of shit # # Born and raised by hypocrites # # Hearts recycled but never saved # # From the cradle to the grave # # We are the kids of war and peace # # From Anaheim to the middle east # # We are the stories and disciples # # Of the Jesus of Suburbia # # Land of make believe # # And it don't believe in me # # Land of make believe # # And it don't believe # # And I don't care # # I don't care # # I don't care # # I don't care # # I don't care # # Dearly beloved are you listening? # # I can't remember a word that you were saying # # Are we demented or am I disturbed? # # The space that's in between insane and insecure # # Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void? # # Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed? # # Nobody's perfect and I stand accused # # For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse # # To live and not to breathe # # Is to die in tragedy # # To run, to run away # # To find what you believe # # And I leave behind # # This hurricane of fucking lies # # I lost my faith to this # # This town that don't exist # # So I run, I run away # # To the lights of masochists # # And I leave behind # # This hurricane of fucking lies # # And I walked this line # # A million and one fucking times # # But not this time # # I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize # # When there ain't nowhere you can go # # Running away from pain when you've been victimized # # Tales from another broken home # # You're leaving, You're leaving # # You're leaving # # Ah you're leaving home # Well that's one song. [LAUGHTER] Tre's got the mallets out. -It's week one, can you give me a whole recap of what happened this week? In song? # First we had a fire # # Then ghosts knocked the speaker down # # Then I got a muffin for breakfast # # And I couldn't choke it down # # Down, down # # Then I woke up # # And Kenny's nuts were in my mouth # # T-baggin' a dude # # Who went to sleep with his shoes on ain't right # Look fellas, I broke my first pedal. Today. Found a design flaw in the old DW equipment. ..like if you're a kid and you want to drink it shouldn't be "Don't drink" -Oh I know. -It should be "Don't drink MY SHIT!" -Yeah -This is how they do it to kids, they got to teach kids how to drink responsibly. Cause that's what they do in Europe, you know? They should do like "Ok, alright "You need to drink water in between if you're gonna drink "Enjoy your buzz, don't get just fuckin' shitfaced." Right now I'm gonna teach kids how to drink responsibly. This goes to everyone from the.. what's the average age where kids start to drink, about 14? -4th grade [LAUGHTER] No, I mean like.. I'm gonna say 8th grade. -7th -7th and 8th graders, since you are gonna drink.. -Drink Guinness! -This is what you do. Ok, for those of you who want to start with beer, it's probably gonna taste a bit nasty. So, and don't worry about all the kids that are the jocks that are sayin' "Oh you pussy, you can't fuckin' drink that much, haha" You gotta drink one beer, nurse it for a long time, enjoy the flavor, then drink some water, make sure you buy a 6 pack of water every time you buy a 6 pack of beer, so water per beverage. -Or be near a sink so you can drink the water out of it. -It is, isn't it? -I wish I was doing that, because the first time I got wasted I drank 18 cans of Stroh's. [LAUGHTER] -I'll never forget it. -Oh yeah you puke for a good 3 or 4 hours. -Sroh's will make you puke black! -Oh yeah I was puking then I started drinking again and puking and I left a full one.. here's my advice, before you pass out open one up and leave it in the refrigerator and the next morning it'll be flat and really cold so that'll get rid of your hangover immediately just.. gone. Oh yeah, it's great. -Thanks dad. -So kids, when you get really hungover drink some more. It gives Billy that medieval look. -Or that network look, stop it! People are gonna figure it out. What? My evil look? -No, medieval -Medieval? In the days of yore. Ok, you wanna see my fuckin' "I'm psycho" look? Ok, you wanna see my "I wanna fuckin' fuck you" How about "It's a happy day today" -All your looks are the same! Welcome back to part 5 of the history of Green Day. The year was 2004, the year of the American Idiot, a masterpiece. Let's wake the boys up and ask them a few questions, shall we? Billy is it fair to say that American Idiot was a concept record? Well, when Led Zeppelin did Dark Side of the Moon, I was just thinking, "We have to be able to get "on that level, something more monumental" -Tre, why don't you tell us about the song Holiday? Um.. Uh.. I dunno. -Want another one? [LAUGHTER] a different song? [LAUGHTER] Shush! Mike can you tell us about the song Holiday? Well.. [LAUGHTER] -You're fired. -It's a tough question. -Do you guys have an aversion to talking about the song Holiday for some reason? -No -No, not at all -Well, why don't one of you tell us about September Song, it's a very moving, very sad song. Um, well Holiday.. [LAUGHTER] That didn't work did it? [LAUGHTER] The Italian version. [LAUGHTER] Triplets Rob, triplets! Alright, let's go. It's hard to go into new places, just because you're so familiar with what you know in anything, if you get into what you don't know then that's when things get scary, but exciting at the same time, so I think any time you write a song that's like.. You're nervous about, and excited about at the same time, I think you're on to something new, pretty much. Like the sound of Boulevard of Broken Dreams. # I walk a.. # -It's too fast! What's that? -There's no way that changed, unless that's digital.. -Yeah yeah.. -But he starts it to it, it'll be ok. Alright, turn it off. # I walk a lonely road # # The only one that I have ever known # # I walk this empty street # # On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams # # Where the city sleeps # # And I'm the only one and I walk alone # Turn the tremolo down a little bit still, Bill. # Walk alone # # I walk alone, I walk a # # My shadow's the only one that walks beside me # # My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating # # Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me # # 'Til then I walk alone # # I'm walking down the line # # That divides me somewhere in my mind # # On the border line # # Of the edge and where I walk alone # # Read between the lines # # Of what's fucked up and everything's alright # # Check my vital signs # # To know I'm still alive and I walk alone # # I walk alone, I walk alone # # I walk alone, I walk a # # My shadow's the only one that walks beside me # # My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating # # Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me # # 'Til then I walk alone # # I walk alone, I walk a # [CHEERING] We got it. # I walk a # # My shadow's the only one that walks beside me # # My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating # # Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me # # 'Til then I walk alone # [CHEERING] Alright. The weather in the bay area and every where up here is nice, but once you get past June.. [FARTS] it's a little bit rainy, up til like -maybe August, September and then the rest, but basically it hardly ever rains there. [FARTS] And the weather's almost perfect the whole year round. -Geez, I'm a little close, I gotta climb outta this. -Now that I did it again.. I think it crashed your computer. -The computer farted. -I was swimming on the beach at 8 o'clock at night. -You were swimming? -Totally warm water. -Wow, that's not a good look. -Not a good smell, either. -That actually smells pretty good. -I'll catch you on the rebound on that one, man. So guys, we need art. That's what the world needs. We're creating art, but we can't do the kinda art we need. But what are you.. ok what do you want? What are you looking for, what are you seeing? Well.. we got some books, I wanted something that's -gonna really fit. -Go nuts. We need somebody who's as good at art as we are at music. To be working with us and coordinating all of it. And that doesn't sound like that crazy of a thing to ask for, but it's pretty impossible, because we're that good at music! [LAUGHTER] And modesty. I mean when you think of something like a concept record, a punk rock concept record, umm.. or like, you know, a rock opera kinda stuff you know what I mean.. You know I like certain bold symbols, like everybody.. I mean if you know Jesus Christ Superstar you know that's the symbol for it. -So iconic? -Iconic, yeah! But what is.. ok do you have the final title of the album? -American Idiot -You could do a picture of George Bush and people would get pissed off about the controversy.. -No, we.. nah -We like the fun aspect of it, too You don't wanna lose sense of the humor in it too. -And it's also self effacing to a certain extent. -Well it's a personal thing, it's like, I know.. it's like I'm not just exposing other people, I'm exposing myself. -Yeah, you're saying "I'm an American Idiot "we're all American Idiots" to a certain extent, yes? When do you think this album's coming out? Silence! # Starry nights city lights coming down over me # # Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head # Well I think when it comes to writing melody we really like to write a certain way. But when it comes to uh.. we like to write what's fun to play for us. But we really wanted to expand on the structure, just make each song maximum.. I dunno maximum Green Day, maximum emotion. Yeah that's wicked. I think that politically in this record we don't really have an agenda, we're just not saying, you know "This politician's wrong, this is wrong" blah blah blah, it's saying "You know, amongst all the different medias "and in today's society, right now "with all the media being swayed one direction or the other "and all the information being thrown at you "and throw this war on top of it.. "We've had enough" and we're ready to say "You know what, I feel confused "and disenfranchised and you know, "as individuals we're losing our individuality." What do you think of this order, it goes St. Jimmy.. [HUMMING MELODY] -That's cool. [MOUTHING DRUM SOUNDS] -That works. -It's either this one goes here, or this one goes here. I keep on hearing it coming out of.. hearing Extraordinary Girl coming out of Novocaine. -Yeah -It sounds good. Just makes a lot of sense to me, you know? Writing this record, it's like.. I kind of, the whole thing is like trying to get myself in a head space of like rocking out in front of the mirror when I was like 14. I like that pattern I play with the drum.. [MIMICS DRUMS] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.. Very Bonham. We're gonna do St. Jimmy first, we're just gonna.. it's.. he's gonna do St. Jimmy and then I'm just gonna keep on going after that. # St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway # # Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade # # Lights of a silhouette # # He's insubordinate # # Coming at you on the count of 1, 2 # 1, 2, 3, 4! # My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out # # Suicide commando that your momma talked about # # King of the forty thieves I'm here to represent # # That needle in the vein of the establishment # # I'm the patron saint of the denial # # With an angel face and a taste for suicidal # # Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope # # I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe # # Raised in the city in a halo of lights # # Product of war and fear that we've been victimized # # I'm the patron saint of the denial # # With an angel face and a taste for suicidal # # Are you talking to me? # # I'll give you something to cry about # # St. Jimmy # # My name is St. Jimmy, I'm a son of a gun # # I'm the one that's from the way outside # # I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun # # In the cult of the life of crime # # I really hate to say it but I told you so # # So shut your mouth before I shoot you down ol' boy # # Welcome to the club and give me some blood # # I'm the resident leader of the lost and found # # It's comedy and tragedy # # It's St. Jimmy # # And that's my name # And don't wear it out! [LAUGHTER] It's like a little fuckin' Broadway at the end there. -Have you thought at all about turning this into some sort of theatrical event or movie? -No. Is there such a thing as great Broadway? I don't think so! God I hope not! There was one journalist that mentioned that we were taking it to Broadway, and it would be so off-Broadway it would be like on Serrano Avenue or something like that. I'd eventually like to see this thing done on ice. I'm ready to take that fuckin' message board. -Why, what're they saying now? They're like "Oh I guess. Oh God bongos! "Maybe this.. can they actually make a record worse than Warning?" "Why does Billy Joe play all the nice guitars now.. "Professional guitars now" it's like.. -Yeah and you're holding that guitar. I know, it's like "Fuck you" "Dude, Kerplunk is the only good record they ever made" -Did you read that one too? No they just say shit like that all the time, you know it's like "Their fuckin' new stuff sucks "I don't even know why I'm here right now -"And writing this" -"And writing this" -"And looking at all the pictures.." "By the way Draco rules!" Seriously! "Oh God fuckin' Warning fuckin' sucked, man "that record was fuckin' terrible, "but fuckin' Billy Joe is so hot!" -"Check out his ass" -Seriously! It's like then you're like.. "What did I just read?" "When they stay home they just sit around and get fat" "It's only when they're on tour do they get skinny" -That's classic "They need to make a record like Dookie again" Sorry, I didn't mean to bring the room down. -No, no, that's funny. "What's with Mike's mohawk?" "He looks like an idiot" [LAUGHTER] -Yeah they said that. -Oh that's funny! "God, loose the bangs!" "Mike looks like a stripper now" [LAUGHTER] See now you're paranoid, aren't ya? They get ya, don't they!? -Yeah! Little pricks, they're like gremlins. The only thing I'd ever heard was like a slide guitar with lots reverb on it. It's like a Doors-ey, you know.. # Let's swim through the moonlight # Because it's got more of a woop- woo, you know it just kinda glides and spaces out, you know. Not like a.. let's not turn into Robert Johnson or something. -Right, right. I gotta learn how to play slide. -You know! -I'll figure it out. OH YEAH! [LAUGHTER] -It's good! Do I smell something?.. Oh it's the fretboard.. smokey! Alright, now what? Let's listen to Novacaine. Maybe we should have Mike stay for one second, grab Mike, tell him to stay, I wanna listen to Novacaine. # Take away the sensation inside # # Bittersweet migraine in my head # # It's like a throbbing toothache of the mind # # I can't take this feeling anymore # # Drain the pressure from the swelling # # This sensation's overwhelming # # Give me a long kiss goodnight # # And everything will be alright # # Tell me that I won't feel a thing # # So give me Novacaine # -Hmm.. -What do you think? -I love it. Listen to it one more time. # Drain the pressure from the swelling # # This sensation's overwhelming # Rest on your laurels, you'll never go anywhere, like I always wanna.. I always wanna be doing something. I feel like I would be wasting my time otherwise, I find interest in what I do. If you're fortunate in life you'll enjoy what you do and hopefully it's what you do best. And whether that's band practice, or studio, or soundcheck or whatever it is, my life basically revolves around music. Everyone else? Well, you come next. You come second, and I'm sorry about that, but the people in our lives, they understand that we run an alternative lifestyle, we have for a long time, and we're blessed to have them with us. Again. That's how you get your fuckin.. your fuckin' mojo in your fuckin' bass. When it cuts you, you fuckin' rub it into the fretboard. Trinkets, one of the other benefits of fatherhood. Trinkets, then you get art and all this stuff, kids give you art and you're like "It's not very good, but I'll hang it up anyway I guess" "Oh yeah, that's right, you're fuckin' 4" # Oh I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee # Oh, wrong culture. -Dude, open this fucker! -There it is, ok? Here, why don't we put it here. -For inspiration. -Best traditional gospel album 2003 Go Tell It on the Mountain! The Blind Boys of Alabama, hey that's cool! I want this to.. Best Rock Album of the year. When I signed Green Day, there were 10 people on the A&R staff, ok? 10 fuckin' people. How many people.. and I was low man on the totem pole, how many of those people wanted me to sign Green Day? -Probably 9 -4. -Only 4? -So that's pretty high actually, so.. -Only half -That's what you're saying, right? No, what I'm saying is that nobody really knows, it's hard. It seems obvious to sign Green Day now, but back then.. -Well if 40% of the whole A&R staff said a band should be signed, isn't that a good sign? Cause everybody's guessing, right? You know? I'm just trying to tell you how fuckin' hard.. like, it's not obvious who to sign, and what to do, and where to put your money if you're a record company. -Like for you to sign Green Day would it have to be a democracy? Did you have to have votes? No, thank God. But I'm telling you that's how it works though, sometimes. The great thing is this band that I was just trying to sign.. Here's how cuts work both ways. I had support from my bosses when I was trying to sign Green Day and the Goo Goo Dolls, the Goo Goo Dolls by the way only had 2 people that wanted me to sign them, me and my direct boss, Michael Austin, everybody else thought I was signing "The poor man's Replacements" that's was the quote! "Why do you wanna sign the poor man's Replacements?" How about the quote for Green Day. "Um punk music was never really that big, "it didn't sell that many records, "why do you wanna sign a punk band?" How about that fuckin.. -So what'd you say? I said "This is fuckin' cool" That's what I said. I said "This is cool" and you know what, I also said this, I said "I think there's probably "about 100,000 kids that'll get this it'll be worth it." "It's a small business deal, but it'll be worth it." # In olden days a glimpse of stocking # # Was looked on as something shocking # # Now everyone knows, anything goes # # Good authors too who once knew better words # # Now only use four letter words # # Writing prose, anything goes # # The world has gone mad today # # And good's bad today # # And black's white today # # And day's night today # # And most guys today # # That women prize today # # Are just silly gigolos # # So though I'm not a great romancer # # I know that you're bound to answer # # When I propose # # Anything goes # # If driving fast cars you like # # If low bars you like # # If old hymns you like # # If bare limbs you like # # If Mae West you like # # Or me undressed you like # # Well, nobody will oppose # Adrian tried to get me a college degree because of my travels and everything. And they said "Hell no" [LAUGHTER] They tried to get me a, what do you call it? Like a doctorate in like music, or I have no idea. -Did you graduate from high school? -Me? -Yeah.. me neither. That's probably why you didn't get the college doctorate. I guess there's some stipulation. We left for tour the day after Mike graduated from high school. -Really? -Yep, talk about a waste of 6 months We should've left 6 months earlier. Whassup!? [PLAYS MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC] [PERSIAN ACCENT] # My fair lady # You all know the words! I wrote it, goddammit in the public domain. That's my name is Public Domain, don't you understand?! It really fucked me. -What's that? -Let's try it again from the same spot. 1,2,3! # She's an Extraordinary girl # # In an ordinary world # # And she can't seem to get away # # He lacks the courage in his mind # # Like a child left behind # # Like a pet left in the rain # # She's all alone again # # Wiping the tears from her eyes # # Some days he feels like dying # # She gets so sick of crying # [WIND NOISES] You know I think for a lot of people when they're younger, you know, it's like people are so driven on these certain Freudian impulses or whatever. So especially young males, where they lash out and it becomes something that's about their parents, or their fathers, or something like that. I think ultimately when you become a man you sort of have to face those dangers a little bit more, I mean you don't have to get rid of the danger, but I think what the exciting thing about getting older is that for the first time, you're confronting that danger and that's kind what the album's really kinda turning into. Alright, ready? # Words get trapped in my mind # # Sorry I don't take the time to feel the way I do # # 'Cause the first day you came into my life # # My time ticks around you # # But then I need your voice # # As the key to unlock # # All the love that's trapped in me # # So tell me when it's time # # To say I love you # # All I want is you to understand # # That when I take your hand # # It's 'cause I want to # # We are all born in a world of doubt # # But there's no doubt # # I figured out # # I love you # # And I feel lonely for # # All the losers that will never take the time to say # # What was really on their mind instead # # They just hide away # # Yet they'll never have # # Someone like you to guard them # # And help along the way # # Or tell them when it's time # # To say "I love you" # # So tell me when it's time # # To say "I love you" # Wow, that's great. -You like it? -Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah I'm glad that we have it 'cause it might just push something over the edge in a place. It might fit, it might not fit, but that emotion's so good. And I like how it's so directed. Um I don't know how important it is for people, cause some people just seriously like to listen to the music. But good lyrics have always been important to me. You know, especially when, you know it's like when somebody gets it and you're like "Ahh, that's cool" Should I just go in and record this real fast? -Yeah, you could, then we could just place it wherever you want it to start. -Yeah, I could just play it over, and over, and over again. -Yeah, we'll just place it.. Hey can you hear me? -Yes! -Hi! -Oh my God, the magic of technology! -It sounds really, really good. -Ok, let me try it a couple times then you can tell me what to do. What to change. -Ok, do it as many times as you want. # Nobody likes you # # Everyone left you # # They're all out without you # # Having fun # It's really good. # Nobody likes you # # Everyone left you # # They're all out without you # # Having fun # I'm bored now, can you comp it? [LAUGHING] Yeah, no problem. -Well good luck with your record.

Tune it up real quick, make it sweet. Ah this is fun. This guitar's gonna come in. -Sounds good. -Nice. Is this a power ballad? [LAUGHTER] You know I can ruin a good time real fast anytime you want me to. I'm just checking the sound, just play a little real quick. [GERMAN ACCENT] I'm from Germany and I live here in United States, I'm tambourine artist in Hollywood Studios as you can see they call me Captain Hey.. on account of I'm also brought in the studio to say "Hey" on records. And to hit the tambourine in a certain way -What records have you done "Hey" on? Perhaps you've heard the Outkast "Hey Ya" every time is says "Hey" it's Captain Hey that's me.. unsung hero. But I don't really like to.. It's part of my gig, is to not to.. -Hey is the only thing you do? No it's not to be appreciated, it's like giving to charity, you know? You don't do it for the credit. You do it for the satisfaction of fixing people's records. Mix em'! Play! Play! Like I play my harem, a little bit of caucasian, a little bit of black, a little bit of persian. Can you send a runner, Jimmy, to get a 50 pound bag of magnesium sulfite? [LAUGHTER] YEAH! Hey can you please mute that? YEAH! -Hey could you please mute that? YEAH! [LAUGHTER] -Hey can we get Zach to bring his percussion box down? [LISPY VOICE]-Bring his box down.. tell Zach to bring his perc box. [LAUGHTER] His big UUUNNGHH! Oooh oooh! YEAH MAN! Oh no, wait a minute I don't this this is such a good idea OOOooooh! [LAUGHTER] -I don't think this is such a good idea, is that what you said? I don't think this is such a good OOOooooh! -Do the second block, start with the second block -Starting with the second block. -So you want me to use the whole.. -Use all that. From in the chorus, from the chorus to where you stopped, right? I didn't realize how little I play in this song. -But you got a great moment. -Oh yeah! Oh no, it's key, it's probably the best moment in the song, actually. [LAUGHTER] Don't think I don't think that about every song anyway. No, it's badass. It's just structurally.. -That song's kicking my ass. -I like it a lot. -Me too, I love it. Yeah.. it's about time you wrote this one. # Summer has come and passed # # The innocent can never last # # Wake me up when September ends # # Like my fathers come to pass # # Seven years has gone so fast # # Wake me up when September ends # # Here comes the rain again # # Falling from the stars # # Drenched in my pain again # # Becoming who we are # # As my memory rests # # But never forgets what I lost # # Wake me up when September ends # [CHEERING] # Summer has come and passed # # The innocent can never last # # Wake me up when September ends # # Ring out the bells again # # Like we did when spring began # # Wake me up when September ends # # Here comes the rain again # # Falling from the stars # # Drenched in my pain again # # Becoming who we are # # As my memory rests # # But never forgets what I lost # # Wake me up when September ends # [CHEERING] # Summer has come and passed # # The innocent can never last # # Wake me up when September ends # # Like my fathers come to pass # # Twenty years has gone so fast # # Wake me up when September ends # # Wake me up when September ends # # Wake me up when September ends # Take him to the corner! [COMMOTION AND LAUGHTER] I love every minute of it! [LAUGHTER] I never purposely write the sad songs, or anything like that, I think it's more.. It's just more natural it comes out and you know, but at the same time I think there's something, like when you write something that's a sad song I think we have, the way our music is, it becomes uplifting sometimes. [LAUGHTER] I gotcha. No problem! YEAH! -Wait, where's that sampling keyboard? YEAH! Yeah, there you go! [REPLAYS YEAH IN DIFFERENT TONALITIES] Sounds like a cow. [YEAH, YEAH, YEAH] [LAUGHTER] See, I don't even have to do it anymore I could just say something, and Just be like.. [YEEEAAAAAHHHH] [YEEAAAH] [LAUGHTER] Mmhmm.. You know what's good about being, like remember when I told you about doing some kind of acapella intro to um.. to right before the Death of St. Jimmy? -Oh yeah. I have this one song that I only like the beginning part of it. It's that one that # My heart is beat.. # # My heart is beating from me # # I'm standing all alone # # Please call me only if you are coming home # # Waste another year flies by # # Waste a night or two # # You taught me how to live # I came into the studio one day, nobody was around so I decided to write this 30 second song. And everyone came back to the studio and Billy heard it and was like "Oh that sounds great, I wanna do one!" so then he connected one to it. Threw the ball to Tre, Tre connected one, and through the course of like a week it ended up being this 10 and a half minute thing which most of it ended up becoming Homecoming on the record. # ..seeds of the last of the dope # # There's a glow of light # # The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night # # Bearing gifts and trust # # The fixture in the city of lust # # What the hells your name # # What's your pleasure and what's your pain? # # Do you dream too much? # # Do you think what you need is a crutch? # # In the crowd of pain # # St. Jimmy comes without any shame # # He says "We're fucked up", but we're not the same # # And mom and dad are the ones you can blame # " Jimmy died today # # He blew his brains out into the bay # # In the state of mind # # That's my own private suicide # # And nobody cares, and nobody cares # # Does anyone care if nobody cares? # # And nobody cares, and nobody cares # # Does anyone care if nobody cares? # # Jesus is filling out paperwork now # # At the facility on east 12th street # # He's not listening to a word now # # He's in his own world # # And he's daydreaming # # He'd rather be doing something else now # # Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly # # His life's on the line with anxiety now # # And she had enough, and he had plenty # # Somebody get me out of here # # Anybody get me out of here # # Somebody get me out of here # # Get me the fuck right out of here # # So far away # # I don't want to stay # # Get me outta here right now # # I just wanna be free # # Is there a possibility # # Get me out of here right now # # This life like dream ain't for me # # 3,4! # # I fell asleep while watching Spike TV # # After 10 cups of coffee # # And you're still not here # # Dreaming of a song # # When something went wrong # # But I can't tell anyone # # 'Cause no one's here # # Left me here alone # # When I should have stayed home # # After 10 cups of coffee # # I'm thinking # # Where'd you go? # # Nobody likes you # # Everyone left you # # They're all out without you # # Havin' fun # # Everyone left you # # Nobody likes you # # They're all out without you # # Havin' fun # # Where'd you go? # # I got a rock and roll band # # I got a rock and roll life # # I got a rock and roll girlfriend # # And another ex-wife # # I got a rock and roll house # # I got a rock and roll car # # I play the shit out the drums # # And I can play the guitar # # I got a kid in New York # # I got a kid in the Bay # # I haven't drank or smoked nothin' # # In over 22 days # # So get off of my case # # Off of my case # # Hey! # # Here they come marching down the street # # Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat # # Coming back from the edge of town # # Underneath their feet # # The time has come and it's going nowhere # # Nobody ever said that life was fair now # # Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear # # In the summer heat # # The world is spinning around and around # # Out of control again # # From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down # # So send my love a letterbomb # # And visit me in hell # # We're the ones going # # Home # # We're coming home again # # Home # # We're coming home again # # I started fuckin' running # # As soon as my feet touch ground # # We're back in the barrio # # But to you and me, it's Hollywoodtown # # It's home # # We're coming home again # # Home # # We're coming home again # # Home # # We're coming home again # # Home # # We're coming home again # # Home # # We're coming home again # # Home # # We're coming home again # # Home # # We're coming home again # # Home # # We're coming home again # # Nobody likes you # # Everyone left you # # They're all out without you # # Having fun # Yeah! -It might work. -Yeah, let's do it. -Mkay -You wanna do it acapella? No, I think with one guitar, or just one electric, just something like ratty. -Wanna record it? -Don't have to do it now we can do it next week. Well I think the world is a teeter-totter and in some places things get better and in some places things get worse but I think politically in this record we don't really have an agenda we're just trying to.. the song American Idiot isn't saying, you know "This politician's wrong "This is wrong, blah blah blah" it's saying, as far as this record's going it's an agenda.. it's not a personal agenda it's like "I wanna think for myself" and that's all it's saying, it's raising a discussion. What the hell am I gonna do with myself when I go home? I can't do it now, so.. [COMMOTION] you gotta do it 3 times.. [COMMOTION] break a speaker, man. I got drunk, I didn't mean to. [LAUGHTER] -It's Margie's fault. -Yeah, she was just fuckin.. -Free booze! -Who's fault? The hostess, she just kept fillin' our drinks up all night. Hearing it a little outta tune makes me wanna go to other notes. -Turn the monitors off then -Maybe Tre needs to walk around the building? No, I just need to have you guys all shut up and let me play. So the very first part where I come in I wanna try and get one more without it.. # Thought I ran into you down on the street # # Then it turned out to only be a dream # # I made a point to burn all of the photographs # # She went away and then I took a different path # # I remember the face but I can't recall the name # # Now I wonder how whatsername has been # # Seems that she disappeared without a trace # # Did she ever marry old what's his face? # # I made a point to burn all of the photographs # # She went away and then I took a different path # # I remember the face but I can't recall the name # # Now I wonder how whatsername has been # # Remember, whatever # # It seems like forever ago # # Remember, whatever # # It seems like forever ago # # The regrets are useless # # In my mind # # She's in my head # # I must confess # # The regrets are useless # # In my mind # # She's in my head # # From so long ago # # Go, go, go, go # # And in the darkest night # # If my memory serves me right # # I'll never turn back time # # Forgetting you, but not the time # That's fuckin' good. I don't even know how to judge this fuckin' record. I don't even know, I have no clue. People that.. like that lady was like "So, do think of this as your comeback record?" I dunno, I think it was like, as far as making a record, I think it was the best time we've ever had. In lots of ways because I just felt like with all the people that were around, our friends that were around it's the first time in a long time we felt like we were making a record that sort of felt like a scene of people, you know? It was just.. so there's that great thing that you feel, but there's also that sadness where you're like, "Wow, I'm never gonna "make this record again," you know, so it's, you know you kinda look back and you kinda remember, like there's certain scenes here and there from looking at the footage and you're going "Oh I remember what we did that night" after, you know "Oh that was a great day!" you know, and you kinda just go "Awe" so it kinda makes to feel uh.. sad.
