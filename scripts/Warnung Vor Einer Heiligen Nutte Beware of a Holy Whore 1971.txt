Goofy wants to be a children's nurse... so he borrows some clothes from his Aunt Anna... a red-and-white checked calico dress and a big hat. And he tries his luck as a kindergarten teacher, not very successfully, though... because the kids all say they've never seen such a queer old doll. Goofy gets beaten up by the kids... and flings his gear in the trash can. At that moment, an escaped convict comes by... Wee Willy, the gangster. He's no bigger than a 3-year-old girl. He finds Goofy's gear in the trash can... and puts it on. On his way home, Goofy bumps into Wee Willy... wearing Aunt Anna's dress. "Poor little homeless mite," Goofy thinks... and takes the little girl home. He dishes up pheasant and partridges... and a whole goose, and Wee Willy stuffs himself full. Goofy's pretty surprised at the little girl's appetite. But he's mighty pleased, too... and thumps his fists on the table. Wee Willy behaves terribly, but at last Goofy finds joy... Looking after a child. During the night, the house is surrounded by gangsters. No, not by gangsters, by police. They storm the house and find Wee Willy. They recognize him, despite the gear he's wearing. Goofy's amazed and asks... what they want of a poor little girl. "This is terrible! "What has she done? Poor little orphan!" The police inform him that it's Wee Willy, a wanted criminal. And as the police carry Willy out... explosive as a hand grenade... Goofy says: "It must have been a shock for the poor little girl... "to find out she's a crook." Look how he gives him a light! Thanks. I still think he's great. Surely its possible to get a number in Stuttgart! Yeah, I'll wait. David! I'm busy. Room 23. Hanna! Fred here. - They all belong to the same clique. - Who? Hanna, Ricky... David, Fred... the girl with the curls. You should clean your teeth. Stop mauling me! And Kosinski. They're a kind of commune. What's a commune? They all live together and so on. We start shooting tomorrow, Herr Meister. Is there really no chance of... No, in Munich the check will be... Okay, I'll phone you later. It makes me sick! Another repressed queen! Who? Our coach. I've drawn up the waking list. You stupid cow! We don't even have the material, and you make a waking list! You don't have to shout at me. I'll shout at you as long as I like! Where's Mandig? You have to wait for the supertrip... then it's peace all the way. When I came back from a high once... I knew what it was like in the womb. When's Jeff due back? Candy! Senor Candy! Damn it! How often do I have to shout? Whenever I want to ask you something, I have to shout. What the hell are you unit manager for? Don't you realize how fond of you I am? Come on! Get up! I hate you, you satyr! You, too, you witch! I could have done that. Shut your mouth, Koberle! I'm as quiet as a mouse. He's probably ancient. Who knows? There was a race steward in Le Mans who was 60, but he was really with it. How much? You're all rats! Assholes! What's the matter? They're all so nasty! Come on, now! Let's have a drink! Everything's going wrong. We're not getting the material from Germany. The check has bounced. Okay! If you say so! Someone will publish my book. You reckon? Otherwise, I'll start an international hash ring. That's pretty dangerous. Luck's on my side. I don't know what he sees in Eddie. Can you see him as big box office? Ah, what do we know? I do my job and that's all. The Spanish lighting guy turns me on. He's gay. You think so? Let's wait and see! This place is crawling with gays. Charlie! What happens if the material doesn't turn up in time? They've cashed the drafts. I thought they'd wait a few days. Babs! Yes? Go up and write the call sheet! Care to do some work? Or do you earn your money sleeping? Whatever I do is wrong. Don't keep answering back! - He doesn't know when to stop. - That's nothing new. Hello, Margaret! I hope everything's okay. Yes thanks, Mark. Things are fine with us. May I sit down? Sure. The English dialogue... Just a moment! We have to coordinate the English and German texts... for the German dubbing. That's obvious. Just do your job, and they'll leave you alone. They won't let me do my job. - Are you from Germany? - Yes. My German's not good enough for that. Thanks. - Is he gay? - Who? The lighting guy. If only I knew what I'm meant to look for! The director of the film isn't even here yet! The director must decide on the casting. No understand. Jeff? Hello! But you... No, Jeff. Yeah, sure I understand... But let's at least... But... We can talk about it again tomorrow... Ricky! Move your butt! He's coming, but he doesn't want to make the movie. Says he's spoken with people in Germany... Schlndorff, Lemke. One of them will do it, he reckons. No. I'm not having that! What shall I do with the bar? Here, give it to me! Shall I bring something to drink? A coffee, please. Anyone else? Do some work, you lazy bitch! Lazy bitch, yourself! Everyone thinks he can push me around. - Where's Ricky? - Gone to the coast. Who with? - How are things, Hanna? - Fine, Jeff. Where's the cameraman? He refuses to work before he's talked with you. No problem. Say, what is this place here? The minister's villa. Are you all crazy? I want a palace, and you get me this lousy little hole! I just don't believe it! What is this? A kindergarten? Learn how to make movies first, you bastards! A villa? Don't make me laugh! If you want to get into car racing... you have to do a lot of rally driving... before they'll accept you. And that costs a bomb. He looks really old. Who? I think he's great. How are things, David? Fine, Jeff. Where's Manfred? Room 30. Hello! Hello! How are the horses doing? Okay. If you need anything, just let me know! Have you seen the set? - Have you seen the set, I asked? - I thought you'd like it. It's not even a house, let alone a palace! It's a miserable shack. But who cares? I'm flying back tomorrow. Why that? The material wasn't on board. What material? We can't get the material from Germany, so we've ordered it from Madrid. Why Madrid? Do you think I'm shooting with Spanish material? There's no difference, Jeff. Sascha! I'll go and get him. For once in my life I wanted... to make a movie without having all the responsibilities. You're producing it with my money anyway... and making a balls-up of it, too. I must be nuts! You all do what you like with me... because I'm such a reasonable guy. What's up now? I'm not putting up with it anymore! I stuff my money down that bastard's throat... and I don't even get first-class material. I'm flying home. Book me a flight for tomorrow! Let's talk it over! Have you seen the face he pulls? Where? It's really funny. He keeps doing this. You're beautiful! Really? Yeah. She was so brazenfaced to me. - Who? - Margret. I feel really sorry for her. For both of them, really. They're scared of getting old. Why is Jeff having the movie produced with our money? Ask him! He got into this scrape somehow. You can't ask him anything. He's so strange lately, especially to us. Isn't he? Yes? Especially to our group. Maybe you can have a word with him! You're all from Munich? Yes. I'm from Rome. I'm subhuman in your eyes, I know. I don't understand. You treat me like a Black! You're all so self-satisfied. I'm an outsider for you. You give me the cold shoulder. You're the superior beings because you all belong together. Don't talk bullshit! Why not? I can't get up enough concentration. Oh, yeah? I just want you to have fun. I'm not important. I can't anymore. - Babs! - Yeah? How about it? Okay, I'm going. There's work to be done. Do you have any say here? I guess so. I'm looking for a job... as an extra or something. I may be able to fix you up. Are you alone here? No. I'm with my husband. Oh, I see. In that case... Thank you. Jeff! Oh, Jeff! Just let go of me, honey! Kiss me, Jeff! I haven't seen you for two weeks. I told you to let go or you'll regret it. I have a right to, Jeff. Just leave me alone! But I love you. You hit me! You all saw it. He nearly killed me. He promised to marry me. He wanted to have kids with me. It's all your fault, you pig! Pig! You'll see! I'll show you! All of you! You're all witnesses. He nearly beat me to death. I'll show you! You'll see! Come on! Two Cuba Libres for me. Sure. Cheers, Jeff! - What's up here again? - The usual thing. Jeff! Yeah? Irma's in the production office. She wants her money. She says you promised to marry her. Wants her money, or she's quitting. Let her quit! Tell her I don't want to see her here again. I'm not shooting a single foot if that woman's on the set. - I'm going to bed. Goodnight! - Goodnight! - Okay. I'll tell her. - At once! Okay, but... I've no money to pay her out. The lazy bitch should do some work before she asks for money. Good evening, Mr. Constantine! Enjoy your dinner? Excellent! Do I get my money? Excuse me! Irma, Jeff said no, and he said you should go. Four years I've worked... for that bastard! I whored... for the swine. You'd have starved without me. He promised to marry me. What a stupid bitch I am! Just so I'd go on working for him. He wanted to have kids with me... and I believed it all! Come on, Irma! Lt'll be okay. Good evening, Mr. Constantine! Good evening! - Care to tell me what we're doing tomorrow? - Sure. Mike, I want an incredibly long, slow shot... dolly slowly through the two rooms. Since this is the scene of two brutal murders... our approach must be a complete contrast. If we make it quick and snappy, and it's cut around afterwards... the audience will never get the feeling that a murder takes time... that it's not so simple. The woman must know at once she's going to die. She just stares. After a time... she begins to cry. I want to dolly into the house with Eddie, stay behind him a while and observe... how the minister reacts to his appearance. When the minister stands up, we travel in with Eddie. He speaks about his mandate, and honour and so on. We dolly back to a long shot. Then the murder's committed. Maybe we pan to the woman first. She's standing in the doorway, watching. She's speechless and retreats. Then a slow pan to Eddie. The minister is murdered. Eddie looks for the woman, goes out of picture. Camera stays on the minister, then pans past... old oil paintings... like the guy's... ancestors maybe... and returns to the woman, frontally, with Eddie from the rear. They look at each other. Eddie strikes her. She collapses. Eddie goes into the garden, lights a cigarette... and that's it. A murder like that's a strange thing. It can be really sentimental, and the audience... feels shattered because it thinks it knows the people up there. But not the way they tick. And that's what we want to try to show. You have to understand what a murder really means. Tremendous! But it won't be easy. You reckon Eddie can do it? Do it? Sure. He's got brains. - The lighting won't be easy. - I know. - I'm going to bed. - Goodnight! What's up? The woman there. Oh, I see. What's up? He's hot on this woman. I wouldn't say no either, if she were to come to me. - And if she didn't? - Then I'd keep mine buttoned up. Sascha! Come down, will you? Cigarette? Me, too! That's obvious. Do you think I'd call otherwise? What's the problem? Leave me in peace! Do you have a problem, Mark? No. Do you know this game? - What? - I'll show you. I knew I would come. Shit! The other way round. David, you try it! Well, what's up? Can you fix it for Ricky to fuck that woman? - Which woman? - The one sitting there. She's here with her husband. Offer her money! She just has to tell him she wants to. Otherwise, he can't. No way! Goodnight! Want to try? His reactions are tremendous. Society has made him somehow dead. He can't react from within anymore. Don't talk so much! Try it with me! If you catch me, I'll kiss you in front of everyone. You little ass-peddler. There! Let's go! - You have to go? - I'm afraid so. - Bye! - Bye! Goodbye! Go on, run after the screwed-out cunt! That's all she needs, a pig like you. Let's go listen to some music! Okay. And you can go to hell in future, too! How can anyone sleep with this racket? Serves you right! My face feels like it's inside out. Are you stoned? - Yeah. - Me, too. Do you really believe that? Damn it! I can't understand a word when you speak French. Shall I tell him? Let's sing a song! What song? I'll start and you follow, okay? Okay. Oh, where am I to turn to Now! Oh, where am I to turn to when suffering grief and pain? Whom can I tell of my delight when joy fills my heart again? To Thee, to Thee oh, Father I come in pain and sorrow Thou sendest bliss and gladness Thou healest all my woe No, thanks. I think so. I would move to Spain, too, but... I don't know what we should do either. He must phone Bonn to send the second instalment earlier. Everything okay, Mike? Korbinian! - Yes? - Bring me a cup of tea! Quick! Don't worry, they'll get the message. Let me have the cups back! I need them again. In two years, I'll be making movies myself. I may be a bit slow... but I'm no fool. Like a cigarette? Yes. You can be nice when you want to. Yes, you can. They were all scared of you. But you're quite different. Why don't we get married? We could go off to Peru together. I can't do that to Sascha. We never powder the face in France. No? We can take it off again. Can you step on it? - How much longer do I have to wait? - I'm working as fast as I can. We'll see. - Her parents are wealthy Spaniards. - Yeah? So what? - Tell him about Bonn! - Okay. Can I have a word with you? Sure, just a second. - What are you doing here? - Jeff took me with him. - I give you your orders! - Don't shout at me! When I tell you to be in the office, then stay there! Korbinian! - Has Ricky been here? - I haven't seen him. When he turns up... go through his dialogue with him till he knows it by heart. - Do you understand? - Okay. Go and have a few Cuba Libres! It's your turn, Margret. Ouch! Can't you be more careful? I'm scared of you. Lift it a bit! Still not far enough. Damn it! Hi, Eddie! Everything okay? Where's my coach? - Having a snooze in there. - Then wake him up! What do you think you're being paid for? To crash out? Do you think the others are working just for fun? They're all crazy, I suppose. Get up, you lazy bastard! Sascha! He should go through the scene with Eddie! I'll take care of it. Can we go through it now? No! - How are things? - Fine. Jeff, I'm so pleased we're starting at last. Good! I think I'll play the part... in the nude. It gives a completely different feeling. If you think so. I can't kill a woman with a karate chop. Is that what you call it? It's just not right. I can't hit a woman... then kill her. Can you tell me what it's all about? I explained the whole scene to you in detail yesterday. I just don't understand why the set isn't ready. - Sascha! - What's up? Why is nothing ready here? You're right. You explained it all to me, but... you have to decide where you want to dolly. Must I do everything myself? If you can't decide for yourself, you'll never enjoy your work. Set it up here! - Do you understand now? - Of course. Ricky, I'm meant to go through your dialogue with you. Come on, then! Jeff, you've got to phone Bonn. We need the second installment! Am I going crazy? You can't have spent nearly DM 200,000. No, DM 185,000, by the first day of shooting! - We have. - That's sheer madness! Are you going to phone... - or not? - Sure. For God's sake, tell me if you like it! Yeah, maybe a few more cherubs. Where the hell am I to get cherubs from? He gets crazier every day. I wonder if he'll ever get the thing to work. What's up? Bonn! Understand? Where's the interpreter? She's up there with my brother. What's he doing here? He's the sound engineer. I said I'm shooting without sound. Send him home! And get the interpreter! Linda! Can you move a bit faster? My God, the bitch is slow! I want Bonn. Ministry of the Interior. Damn it! You talk to him! What's up? He says you should go home. Lemmy Caution was always such a gentleman... so noble. What I want to show here... is the guy at the height of power. Brutal... cold-blooded... capitalistic, rational... cold as ice. I don't want to show... a grain of sympathy for people who act in the name... of some Fascist government. What news from Bonn? - I think you're fabulous, Billie. - Ah, come on! We could marry and go to South America. Sure! I won't be content until I know... he's been completely destroyed. I won't be content until I know... he's been completely destroyed. Anything wrong? No, nothing. There's something up with you. I've got stomach pains. My ulcer hurts, that's all. You should have it operated. Yeah, probably. It was the same when I was in kindergarten. I always sensed when something was wrong. What do you mean by that? Nothing special. Because of David, you mean? Because... he's assistant director? I couldn't care less. Look, Ricky... David's doing it simply because I need someone. I don't give a damn! I guess I won't be happy until I know... he's been completely destroyed. - He needs to go to hospital. - Why? He has an ulcer or something. I'll have a word with him. I was with a guy like that for two years. Only later did I realize he must have suffered like a stuck pig. What's that supposed to mean? My whole picture of your masculinity is vanishing fast here. Margret! Margret! I don't have stomach pains. No one's putting the screws on me! I didn't let them in the navy, and I'm not going to here. Is that clear? You can act silent fear, I hope, you lame cow! Or do you have some privilege as the producer's wife? You're acting like a bumpkin on a village stage! Katrin! You play the part! No! Why me, Jeff? Do you think I can? Yeah! Can we get this makeup table out of here? Linda! I'm coming! Can we get rid of that table? Tell the workers to move it out! Of course! Just don't shout! Pack your bags, you deadbeat, and get out! Beat it! Have I made myself clear? Avanti! Move it! What I'd give to sit with Marlene Dietrich in some bar in the desert... knocking it back. I imagine her ice cold... like a businesswoman. No, I think she's real sweet and nice. I imagine her hand on the table, and I lay my head on it. I want to get out of here. I don't want to make this damn movie. Why not? The whole thing here makes me sick. I think it's going to be tremendous. Yeah, that's the trouble. You're a stupid Spanish waiter. You're so dumb... you don't even understand me. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? But you want to earn money? Then learn German first! You stupid, stupid man! Go away! It's just for a few days. He's as big as a tree... and he looks like Gene. It's just a bit of fun, that's all. Come on, Sascha! If I had half a chance... Women are so strange. I'm no fool. But always some stupid job. Then try directing, you asshole! Just don't be a unit manager! That's hard work. If only I knew. My wife... she keeps me down... and I enjoy it. Jeff! I'm so unhappy. Why? I don't know. Where's Ricky? He's so amateurish. That's no way to work. You have to get to know him. He can give you... a sense of latitude as an actor... and that's something rare. Okay. 6 o'clock. Oh, wonderful! The whole bath's under water. Exquisitely young! Oh, yeah? Well, don't I? I need the 25 extras by tomorrow morning. You understand? You can treat me as you like... because what you do... as an artist has quality. Piss off! And then a new guy came, completely straight. Wolfgang Wagner... I didn't notice him at first. One day we were in the hut... pretty stoned. We were on guard duty. We smiled at each other, I gave him a look... and he said yes, and we went to bed together. About two weeks later... we were on guard duty again... and I said, "How about it, Wolfgang?" And he just said: "No." That was all. Sascha, send them all home! I'm not shooting today. - It's too expensive! - What do you mean? It's my money. The bastard doesn't have a cent. But he has to produce movies! Okay, send them home! Do you hear? The producer says send them home. All right! All right! Shit! Soon I'll have to explain every take. Oh, come on, Jeff! It's true, Eddie. I don't want to start from scratch every time. Hanna, tell him. Either he plays it my way, or he can go home. What do you mean by "fun"? We're all dependent on you. Try your luck elsewhere! That's no alternative. It has to function here. You've a greater chance of enjoying your work here. Try to understand! That's all well and good, but we're still dependent on you. And dependency leads to fear, which we'd escaped from. Why are you dependent? Because we don't know what's going on. And we're scared. We really are. Let me explain. One day Manfred phones. He says he has a Spanish co-producer... who would invest DM 250,000 in a movie. "Great!" I think. "We'll shoot it cheaply... "and make the movie with the co-producer's money." Then he made a calculation for DM 500,000... and there was no arguing about it. So I thought, "Okay, I'll invest the money we have from the state." Then suddenly there was no co-producer... and I realized it would be made with our money. It was too late to back out. The contracts had all been signed. That's the position. And now even that's too little... and we of all people get no fees. It's a pain in the butt for me, too. This is Mandig. You kicked Linda out. Yeah. What about it? One more high-handed act like that, and I'll have you deported. This is Spain. There are laws here. Am I right? Do you love Ricky? Maybe. He does it just for the money. So what? He told me that himself. Oh, Jeff, the world's so bad! Here, it's Sascha. Sascha, darling! We're in bed together. Okay, I'll come down. Get out, all of you! I don't want to see you anymore. You bloodsuckers! I hate you all! You just exploit me, then leave me in the lurch! You terrorize me, you bastards! You want my blood! I hate you all! Korbinian! I want 10 Cuba Libres! Do you hear? Don't forget, you're making a movie with people who'd rather be at home... without all the hassle. I love you. Sascha... I can't take any more of this. You'll have to get someone from Germany or finish the movie yourselves! I can't go on! You know very well no one but you can finish this movie. No. Okay. You know... the biggest favour you can do him is not to sleep with him. It's important that the light's brilliant, almost expressionistic. There can be hard crosses cast by the window on the bed. It introduces an artificial tension. It doesn't matter if it seems unnatural. Come up with something yourself! If you say you're making a movie against power... Not against power. Against brutality sanctioned by the state. But if you portray it so aesthetically, in such detail, that's not right either. There must be more to it than that, surely? You're the meanest, most brutal bastard I've ever known. You dirty, little bourgeois rat! He said he's fond of you. You know what the worst thing is? When one realizes how damn bourgeois one is oneself. You haven't just discovered that? Yes, I have. But look at the movies you've made! You know so much about that sort of thing. Leave me in peace! You've cheated me terribly. What do you mean? I don't want to go into all that again. It's crazy! Sometimes I could kill you. Sometimes I could tear the clothes from your body. No, that's really perverse. I can't play it. It's unmotivated. I think it's really hot. Imagine! He's just had an orgasm, and dies. What a death! It's terrific! Can't you see it? No. You two go! Hey, Ricky... I think he doesn't want to give us any more. Shall I? I'll kill you, you bastard! I'll knife you, you fat slob! Stop it! My wife's just the same. She always decides... how things are done. Otherwise she refuses to sleep with me. And one reacts accordingly. - Leave him alone! - Aren't I right? Sure. Absolutely. Now beat it, you idiots! Bastard! You keep out of it! Beat it! I'll give you a lift home... though I often walk home myself. It clears the mind for thoughts one wouldn't have otherwise. Just leave me in peace! No offence! Tomorrow Babs goes home! Do you understand, Sascha? If I see that woman here tomorrow... you can sort out this mess on your own. I swear it. We'll see whether I can really use the little bit of power I have. I've taken so much trouble... and you never say a word. I told you... what you've done is great! Honestly, Fred. You never say a word. I always have to ask. You do as I tell you! If I say "lay the tracks there," then the tracks go there... and not somewhere else. Is that clear? Learn what movies are first! I had to. But it has to fall into your laps, it seems. It makes me sick! Try using your heads for once! It's not so hard to use your brains. You know... the only thing I accept is despair. I just want to talk with the bastard! Stop it! If I can't afford to do that... what am I working for? If I can't smash something... I might as well be dead. Do you understand? Ricky, did you mean what you said about the family? - What kind of movie is it? - It's a film about brutality. What else would one make a movie about? Give me something to drink! You're the only one. You! I have a friend! Did you bring a newspaper... from Munich? Here! There's a picture of you in it. "The Devil of Grunwald. At about 10 o'clock yesterday evening... "the police succeeded in arresting 23-year-old Joseph K... "a sexual offender who has long been wanted..." It's going to be wonderful! He has rediscovered something that's been forgotten. Time. I guess I won't be content until I know... he's been completely destroyed. AND I SAY TO YOU, OFTEN AM I WEARY TO DEATH OF DEPICTING HUMAN NATURE WITHOUT PARTAKING IN HUMAN NATURE
