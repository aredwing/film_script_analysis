They ain't none of'em as pretty in the face like my gal. And that prodigal son... he takes the 'heritance what his pappy gives him... and he spend it on the fast life. But not this boy, Lord No,Jesus, not this boy! And the prodigal son, he is a liar! And the truth ain't in 'im! But not this boy, Lord - He got the truth, Lord! You know, I looks up... and there's the Capitol building looking like a palace on the hill. And the big front door opens... and the president of the United States marches down the avenue... with a band before and a band behind. And he comes right up to my car, and he says, just as natural... Well, Brutus, you sure is much of a man... And I, for one, wants to compliment you on landin' the job."

I get to missin' you more and more on these long runs. You know, you oughtn't to ask me to come here to meet you. - I been afraid. - Fraid of what? You know. OfJeff. He's a bad actor over me. You ain't got nothin' to be afraid of. I can handle that little two-bits porter. You oughta throw him over anyhow. Then it'd be just you and me. Sometimes I wonders. Wonders what? If we gonna last. You ain't got nothin' to worry about, honey. But you ain't heard the good news yet. I been transferred to the president's private car. Aw, that ain't nothin'. Why, Jeff say you don't make no tips on that job. That's why he didn't take it. There you are. That's the difference 'tween me and Jeff. He can't see no bigger than two bits. Me? Why, I'd just be steppin' to my own class on that private car. Harrington, if there is no leak... we stand to clean up millions. - That's the idea. Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Jones. - Good night, sir. Anything on your mind, Jones? I's awful worried about that merger. Sure would be bad for us if that news got out. "Us"? Hmm. - How long have you been with me, Jones? - Six weeks, sir. Learning fast, Jones. Almost too fast. Got any money, Jones? I got about 300 in the bank. All right, you're in the pool for $300. Thank you, sir. And, Jones, uh... I would rather you didn't leave the car until Sunday. Two days solitary, but it'll be worth it. - Right? - Yes, sir. And, Jones, when we get back to New York... it might be a good idea for you to go back on your old run. There's more room for big men in Georgia. Yes, sir. Boy, you sure was born to wear that oyster front. Where'd you get such a good fit? Well, the boss and me talked it over, and he sent me to his tailor. He said, "Jones, you got a position to live up to now... and you can't afford to be careless in your attire." You and Mr. Harrington must be gettin' mighty thick. We just pulled off a little deal together. I give him some valuable advice, and he said, "Jones, you're learnin' fast. You're gettin' big." And then he takes me into partnership. - Ain't you goin' back on the Pullman no more? - Oh, I'll stick by the job for a few more runs. But things don't seem to be goin' quite right on that old run of mine... and the boss asked me to drop down that way and straighten 'em out. When, since I guess you'll be down that way... you'll probably drop in the White House. Well, that's an idea. Look here, what you tryin' to do, kid me? Me, kid you? Boy, you're a scream. "Jones, you're gettin' big. You're learnin' fast. Then he takes me into partnership." Come clean, big boy. Where'd you get that money, in a crap game? Go ahead, laugh some more. You done laughed yourself right off of my payroll. Oh, honey, sweetheart, I didn't mean it. I was only kiddin'. No, you's too funny to live with. Any woman is baggage what gets heavier and heavier, the longer you totes 'em. You got to change 'em to keep travelin' light. Here's $40. And good-bye! So you was all set to do this before you come in, huh? Through is through. You heard me. Then you can go back toJeff. He still thinks there ain't nobody like his Undine. Yeah? Well, you ain't the first man that's gone down-and-out... thinkin' everybody else was a fool. I got eyes, even ifJeff ain't. And you can tell that polecat Belle La Due... if she wants to keep on tryin' to look like Garbo, she'd better stay out of my way. Slim, sister! Well, if it ain't the old big-timer in from the west. Hello, Jeff. Hello, Undine. Undine, meet Miss La Due. I've known Belle since before she straightened her hair... and when she went with Johnson. Where is he now, Belle? Still in jail? Undine! Where is your manners? I'm just trying to talk so that polecat can understand me. Come on, baby, let's dance. What's the matter with you tonight, Undine? I don't like you acting so to my pal. - Your pal? - Yeah. Don't make me laugh. Why, he's been bitin' you in the back for a year. What do you mean? I mean, when I get finished with Belle, he ain't gon' have much left to love. Oh, you dirty little... Hey, you! Stop that! Get out! Go on! Get out! Come on, ma'am! I's travelin' light. Number eight's his point! Come on, you nits. Get back. Give me room. - What's the matter,Jeff?

Look a-here, white man, I comes and I goes, and that's my business. Oh! Oh, well, that's the kind of a nigger you are, eh? Not afraid to stand right up to your betters and tell 'em what's what. You wouldn't be afraid of a bit of fight neither, would ya? When I fights, there's somethin' in it, and I don't never fights on no empty belly.

I's figurin' to open up a little tradin' business next door here. Oh. Cut my bleedin' throat, would ya? After all I've done for you too. Is that your idea of gratitude? Well, I's always ready to listen to reason. And while I'm unloadin', if I was to hear anybody say somethin' about a partnership - Coconut! Pineapple! Fine fat chicken all ready for the tooth! Raisins and new corn! Coconut! Pineapple! Great big chicken all ready for the tooth! Pineapplel Big fat chicken ready for the toothl Good day, Mr. Smithers. Maybe a coconut? Yes, good day. How do, Mr. Smithers? How have you been? - I'm sure glad to see ya. - How do you do? Why don't you come in and pay your bill? That's Mr. Smithers. You know, every time I rides up here through that jungle... it gives me the creeps. Say, you notice they shut the gates after us? Look a-here, white man, is your nerves slippin'? Well, I don't like it. If you had to recruit an army for him, why did you have to get such big blokes? Yes, them is fine niggers. I betcha they knows a man when they sees one. Well, if there's any trouble, you've only got yourself to blame... salutin' him and callin' him " General." I tell you, Mr. Smithers. There's any trouble, you just leave the general to me. Us niggers understands each other. Tell him Mr. Smithers. - You know, you gotta be diplomatic. - Take it easy. - Mr. Smithers to see Your Excellency. - Show the gentlemen in. Well, good day to you, Your Majesty. Well, well. Top-hole, eh? Top-hole. As fine a body of men as ever I clapped me peepers on. - Eh, what, Jones? - Right. Yeah. And well found... if I says it meself as fitted 'em out, eh? Good. Well, General, you got a swell army. And I reckons, when you figure how little it's costin' ya... makes ya feel mighty proud. Send in the treasurer. This my treasurer. Tell the general the truth now - Does you know how to figure? Yes, Your Highness. Now, you see, I got a figurer. Produce the contract. Your bill, Mr. Smithers. Well, here you are, Your Excellency. Now, then, there was a hundred uniforms at five dollars. That's a thousand dollars. There was a hundred rifles at five dollars. A thousand dollars. One cannon was five hundred, and the ammuni - Well, it adds up to $4,000, Your Excellency. What does the treasurer report? It seems to me that there might be a little error. Ah, well, here, let me have a look at it. Yes, we all make mistakes now and again. Here, Smithers - the mistake. I seen it all along. It's... $5,000. There you is, cap'n. Check that off and tell it to the boss. Fire. Fire again. Empty your gun. Don't you all knows I's got a charm? Takes a silver bullet to kill Brutus Jones! My turn now, General. Company! Attention! Take this bush nigger and throw him outta here. I'm boss here now. All of you, get outta here. And wait. Them what I wants to stay will hear from me in an hour. Smithers, you wait. I wants to confer with you. Well, blimey! If you ain't pulled it off! - You have got a nerve. - Nerve... and brains. I calls it stinkin' luck - havin' that nigger miss you twice at 10 feet. Pick up that gun. Break it. Blanks. Blimey. How... You remember when Quaco got drunk in town last night... and I takes care of his gun while he sleeps it off? Well, that's what I call brains. Phew! This place smells more like a chain gang dump than a palace. Say, Smithers, how ya likes the contract for doin' this dump over? Now you're talkin'. And don't make the mistake of thinkin' you's dealin' with any ignorant bush nigger. I gives you an audience tomorrow. And bring along them fashion sheets that I gets last summer. And then I wants mirrors - plenty of'em. And remember, Smithers, red's my color. I always had a special taste for red. Mr. President. No. King Brutus. No. Somehow that don't make enough noise. Smithers, cigarette. Light. Smithers... you has just had an audience with the EmperorJones. My sash. Watch that foot. Give me a drink. My coat. Brush it off. Tell Smithers I'll sees him here. Clear out, all of ya. Your Majesty. Well, Smithers, what's on your mind this mornin'? Remember what I told ya when you slapped that last tax on coffee - that you were cuttin' your own bloomin' throat? Sure. I remembers. What of it? There was a riot down on the village last night... and your tax collector got beaten up so his own mother wouldn't know 'im. Oh, that's old stuff. My army's got them niggers already. And I'm gonna dress 'em down before the whole court this mornin'. - They all needs a lesson. - Too late to give 'em a lesson now, me lad. You've got 'em squeezed dry. Look a-here. When I takes this job, what I tells ya? I says three years for my cleanup, don't I? Well, we's got six months to go. Them's my arrangements, and I ain't gonna change. I suppose you got your money hid away safe, eh? I sure has. And it's banked in a foreign land where they ain't no chain gangs and no jim crow... and nobody can't get it except me. In six months, I walks out on this nigger circus. And from then on, I's top dog. Top dog, eh? Look a-here, white man. There's little stealin', like you does... and there's big stealin', like I does. For little stealin', they get you in jail sooner or later. For the big stealin', they makes you emperor... and puts you in the hall of fame when you croaks. Well, all I know is that it's a wise gambler that knows when to quit. Look a-here, white man. Do you think I ain't still got these niggers like that? You think when I cracks the whip, they don't jump through? All right, I shows ya. I'll summon the court. His Majesty is on the throne. Summon the court. "Archduke and Duchess of Manhattan." "Marquis and Marchioness of Newark." "Marquis and Marchioness of Baton Rouge." "Lord and Lady Baltimore." "Lord and Lady Richmond." And all points in His Majesty's kingdom... north, south, east and west. And Mr. Smithers. Bring in the prisoners. So you's the niggers what takes it upon yourself to start a roughhouse... then beat up an officer of the crown? Well, I see I been too easy on you niggers. Now I'm gonna show ya who's boss around here. Lieutenant. Take them niggers in the courtyard and give 'em 50 lashes apiece. And lock 'em up. I said lock 'em up! Forward march. Captain. Take your company to the five-mile village... and burn it off the face of the earth! Everything! Understand? Right face! Forward march! March! Who dare whistle that way in my palace? Who dare wake up the emperor? I'll get the hides frayed off some of you niggers sure. It was me whistled to ya. I got news for ya. Oh, it's you, Mr. Smithers. What news you got to tell me? Where's all your court - the generals and the cabinet ministers and all? Oh, they mostly runs the minute I closes my eyes. Drinkin' rum, talkin' big down in the town. How come you don't know that? Ain't you sousin' with them most every day? - I got to, in my business, ain't I? - Your business. Blimey. When you landed here, you didn't have no high-and-mighty airs. Talk polite, white man. Talk polite. Do you hear me? I'm boss here now. Is you forgettin'? It's all right. No harm meant, old sop. Well, I accept your apology. Now, what I was then is one thing, and what I is now is another. I wasn't afraid to hire ya that time after you broke jail in the States. No, you didn't have no excuse to look down on me for that. - You been in jail yourself more than once. - That's a lie! That yarn. Come on. Who told you that fairy story? There's some things I ain't got to be told. I can see 'em in folks's eyes. From what I been told, it ain't safe for a black to kill a white man in the States. You mean lynchin's scare me? Well, I tells you, Smithers... maybe I does kill one white man back there. Maybe I does. And maybe I kills another right here 'fore long if he don't look out! You think I'd peach on ya? Not me. - I'm your friend, ain't I? - Sure you is. And you'd better be. I'm gonna show ya that I'm your friend. I'll tell ya that bit of news I was goin' to. Go ahead. Shoot the piece. Must be mighty bad news from the happy way you look. Ain't noticed any of the servants or the guards... around the place this mornin', I ain't. Oh, they all out in the garden sleepin' under the trees. All I got to do is to ring that gong, and they come flyin'. All right. Ring it now, and you'll see what I mean. Sure, I'll ring. The rotten ship is sinkin', and the bloomin' rats have slung their hooks. Low-flung woods niggers! Well, I reckon I overplays my hand this once. Man can't take the pot on a bobtail flush all the time. Was I sayin' I'd sit in six months more? Well, I's changed my mind then. I cashes in and resigns the job of emperor right this minute. Well, blimey. You're a cool bird, and no mistake. No use fussin'. When I knows the game's up... I kisses it good-bye without no long wait. They's all run off to the hills, ain't they? Yes. Lem was taken 'em - every man jack of'em. Then the revolution is at the post... and the emperor better get his feet smokin' up that trail. Goin' to look for your horse, ain't ya? Well, you won't find it. They steals the horses first thing. Well, then I hoofs it. Feet, do your duty. 3:30. Sundown's at 6:30 or thereabout. Oh, I got plenty of time. Make it easy. Well, don't you be so blasted sure. You'll have to hustle to get through that forest in 12 hours... even if you knew the trails like a bloomin' native. Look a-here, white man, do you think I's a natural-born fool? Why, I's gone out in that forest so many times pretendin' to hunt... I knows it high and low like a book. I could find them trails with my eyes shut. And I got tinned grub hid there under a big white stone where I can find it. Oh, I'll be at the edge of the forest by the time dark comes. And once in them woods, them niggers will never find me. Dawn tomorrow, I reaches the coast and boards that French gunboat. I got to laugh at these fool black trash around here. They so easy. Supposin' something happens and they does nab ya? I's got five lead bullets in this gun good enough for common bush niggers. And after that, I's got this silver bullet left... to cheat 'em outta gettin' me. I tells 'em, when the time comes, I kills myself with it. That's 'cause I'm the only man in the world big enough to get me. And you had a silver bullet made? Honest? I sure did. Here she be. Five lead bullets and this silver baby at last. - Don't she shine pretty? - Let me see. - Keep your hands where they belong, white man. - Blimey. You'd think I was a blasted thief. No, it ain't that. I know you scared to steal from me. I ain't allowin' ne'er a body to touch this baby. She's my rabbit's foot. A sort of charm, eh? Blimey. You'll need all your bloomin' charms before long, so help me. What's that drum beatin' for? For you! The blacks is havin' a war dance in the hills, workin' up their courage 'fore they start after ya. Let 'em. They'll sure need it. They're makin' all sorts of devil spells and charms... against your silver bullet. It takes more than that to scare this chicken. Tonight, when it's pitch black in the forest... They'll be sendin' their pet devils and ghosts houndin' after you. You'll find your bloomin' hair will be standin' on end by tomorrow mornin'. It's a mighty queer place that forest is, even in daylight. You don't know what might happen there. It's that rotten still. Always sends the cold shivers down me back the minute I gets in it. Go along, white man. You ain't talkin' to this baby. And what's ghosts and hants got to do with me? Well, don't you know I's a member in good standin' in the Baptist Church? Let 'em try their heathen tricks. The Baptist Church done protect me. Land 'em all in hell. You ain't paid much heed to your Baptist Church down here - takin' up with them bloomin' witch doctors. Oh, sure. I pretends. It don't get me nothin' to do missionary work for the Baptist Church. I's after the coin... and I lays my religion on the shelf for the time being. I ain't got the time to waste on no more fool talk with you. I'm goin' away from here this second. So long, white man. I'll see you in jail sometime maybe. Not me you won't. Here. You ain't goin' out this way, are you? You think I'd sneak out the back door like a common nigger? I's emperor yet, ain't I? And the EmperorJones leaves the way he come. And that black trash don't dare stop him. Not yet leastways. Listen to that roll call, will you? Must be a mighty big drum to carry that far. Well, if they ain't no whole brass band to see me off... I sure got the drum part of it. So long, white man. Give my regards to any ghosts you meet. Well, here I is. In the nick of time too. Sure. Give me air. I's tuckered out sure enough. That soft emperor job sure ain't no trainin'... for a long hike over that plain in the broilin' sun. Bush niggers. A wonder they wouldn't get sick of beatin' that drum. Sound louder, seem like. When did they start in after me? Oh, sure. They's miles and miles behind. What you gettin' fidgety about? You know what? Your belly's empty. That's what's the matter with you. Nothin' but wind on your stomach. Of course you feels diggety. Well, we eats right here and now. White stone, white stone, where is you? Ah, here you is. I knowed this was the right place. Box of grub, come to me. It ain't here. Has I lost the place? There's another stone. Oh, yes, that's it. It ain't here neither. Oh, grub, where is you? You ain't here. Has I got to go hungry in them woods all the night? Huh. Can't tell nothin' from them trees. Nothin' around here look like I ever seen it before. I done lost the place sure enough. It's mighty queer. Mighty queer. Woods, is you tryin' to put somethin' over on me? Who there? Who that? What is ya? Get away from me 'fore I... They're gone. Yeah, that shot fix 'em. Oh, it was only a little animal. Little wild pigs, I reckon. They maybe rooted out your grub and eat it. Sure, you fool nigger. What you think they is - hants? They's here. You give the game away when you fired that shot. Them niggers'll hear that for certain. Get in, nigger. What you scared at? There ain't nothin' there but the trees. Get in there. So the moon's risin'. Does you hear that, nigger? Get more light from this out, and you sees where you's gwine. Cheer up. From now on, you has a snap. It's warm, and that's a fact. How long I been makin' tracks in these here woods? Seem like forever. This am a long night for you, Your Majesty. Majesty. Ain't much majesty about this baby now. Never mind. It's all a part of the game. This night come to an end like everything else. When you gets there safe and has that bankroll in your hands... you'll laughs at all this. Ain't no hammer On this mountain, babe Ring like mine, say Ring like mine This old hammer Ring like silver, say Ring like silver Shine like gol... What you singin' for, you poor nigger? Want all the world to hear you? Hear that old drum? Sure gets nearer from the sound. They're packin' it along with them. Time for me to move. What's that little queer clickety sound I hear? Sound like - Sound... That sound like some nigger was shootin' crap. Time I beats it quick when I get them notes - Who there? Who that? Is that you, Jeff? Jeff. I sure am mighty glad to see ya. But they told me you done died from that cut I gives ya. How you come to be here, nigger? Ain't you gwine look up? Can't you speak to me? Is you - Is you a hant? Nigger, I kills you dead once. Has I got to kill you again? You take it then! He's gone anyway. Hant or no hant, that shot fix him. They's gettin' near. They's comin' fast, and here I is shootin' shots, let 'em know just where I is. Glory. I's got to run. I'm meltin' with heat... from runnin' and runnin' and runnin'. Damn this here coat. Like a straitjacket. That's better. And now I can breathe. I gets rid of them frippety emperor's trappin's... and I travels lighter. How'd this road ever get here? I never remember seein' it before. These woods is sure full of the queerest things at night. Lord God, don't let me see no more of them hants. Oh, sure. That was all in your head. Wasn't nothin' there. Wasn't noJeff. You know what? You just get seein' them things 'cause your belly's empty... and you sick with hunger inside. Bless God I don't see no more of'em whatever they is. Mercy, Lord. Mercy. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I's comin'. You white devil. I'll gets even with you yet sometime. Oh, where's my hammer? Give me my hammer, and I splits his head. Give me a hammer, one of you. Give me a hammer! I'll kills you, you white devil, if it's the last thing I ever does. Ghost or devil, I'll kills you again! Oh, Lord, what I gwine to do now? Ain't got no bullets left. Only the silver one. What is this place? Seem like... Seem like I been here before. What is I doin'? Anyway, seems like I know that stone... and them trees... and the river. I remember. Seem like... Seem like I been here before. Oh! Oh, glory! I's scared of this place! Him dead. Lord, I done wrong. I knows it. O Lord. Lord. Down here, where these fool bush niggers raisin' me up to the seat of the mighty... I steals all I could grab. Lord, I done wrong. I knows it. I's sorry. Forgive me, Lord. Forgive this poor sinner. Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel, Daniel, Daniel Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel Then why not every man Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel, Daniel Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel Why not every man He delivered Daniel from the lion's den Jonah from the belly of the whale The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace Why not every man Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel, Daniel, Daniel Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel Why not every man O Lord! You done protect this sinner. You done saved this sinner, Lord! I done repent. O Lord! I done repent! And I's comin' through, Lord! O Lord, Lord! Yes, I... No. No. Have mercy, Lord. Mercy! Dear Lord! Hear my prayer. Oh! The silver bullet! You don't gets me yet! I'll bet he's miles away by now and safe at the coast. I told you you'd lose him, didn't I? Beatin' your silly drum and castin' your stinkin' spells. - Blimey. What a pack. - We catch him. You see. Why don't you go in the woods and hunt after him? - What's the good in waitin'? - We catch him. Well, you ain't thinkin' that's him, I hopes. That's him. My men got silver bullet. Kill him sure. - They got a silver bullet? - Lead bullet no kill him. Him got strong charm. I cook money, make silver bullet. Make strong charm too. Well, they did for you right enough, Jonesy, me lad. Dead as a herring. Where's all your high-and-mighty airs now, Your bloomin' Majesty? Silver bullets. Blimey. Anyhow, you died in the 'eighth of style.
