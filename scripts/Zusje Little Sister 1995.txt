I'm on my way. Look. Have a good look. And you are going to help me. To record things. Good. Almost. Gate. I think it's here. Come on. Action. Hello? Hello. Martijn? Aren't you going to let me in? So this is where she lives. Quite luxurious, for someone who has only recently moved out on her own. You're older now. And taller. - Switch it off. Impossible. - Why? I want to record the way you react to me. Well, this is it. You can switch it off now. - Can you help me with my backpack? Ive brought you something. Isn't that nice of me? For your collection. Why are you here? - I had to see you. I really missed you. You might have called first. - You wouldn't have let me in, I think. You frightened me. - Why? Or do you believe your own lies? Switch that thing off, dickhead. What's wrong? I'm not doing anything. Goddamn. Jesus. Hi. Who's that creep? - Creep? My brother. His name is Martijn. - Hello. I didn't know you had a brother. - I didn't, until recently. Recently? - I hadn't seen him for a long time. And why is that, do you suppose? - He lives in London. That's right. But I'm here now, to make a film about her life. Nice. You're a very enthusiastic cameraman. Are you going to film everything? Of course. Until I drop. What does Daantje think? - She really likes it. You've come at the right moment. - Why? Now you can film our show. - What show? Daan, why haven't you told him about our show? Shut up, Ingeborg. - Sis... Now he can film everything. Beautiful. - Absolutely. It's heavy. Let me help you. Wait. How much is that projector? - 25 guilders. Does it work? - Alright then, make it 10. Daantje... Get up. Wake up. Watch the alarm clock. Watch. Keep watching. Keep watching. Yes. Exactly 20 years ago you became my sister. Congratulations. Very good. Is this really necessary? - Traditions should be honoured. You're the boss today. What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Little sister. No, I don't know what you mean. No? Think hard. - I really don't have the faintest. Daantje. This is Bas. - Hi, lm Bas. Hello, Bas. - And this is Ramon. Are you the little brother? What brother? - The one with the camera. Yeah, me too. Little brother, come here. Zoom in. Zoom in. Thanks. Are you allowed to read that? Why don't you come and film at my place? For the show. Ill let you see what lm working on. Why would I do such a thing? Aren't you interested in what I have to say? I am. If it concerns Daantje. - And if not? You can go to hell. - What? You can go to hell. Just like that. And you? Fucking bitch. Why do I hate you so much, Daantje? Yuck. Little girls become big girls. Stop or I'll kiss him. - Go ahead. Easy. - I'll do whatever I want, Daantje. Are you okay? Can't you watch that boyfriend of yours? This isn't a zoo. Who are you talking about? - That sleaze ball. Your boyfriend. You know what, Martijn... ...why don't you rewind your tape? Why did you drink so much? Ingeborg, zoom in on this drunk's head. Did you get that? - Yes, I got it. Martijn, I don't mind going to hell, you know. Ciao. - Bye. Bye. Great party. It was a great party. Nice guy. Do you often have boyfriends like that? He has a cute way of kissing. Daantje here. Oh, it's you. Thank you, but that was yesterday. My birthday was yesterday. Well, it may be today where you are. Here, it was yesterday. Great. That's the way to snap at her. But it doesn't really take a lot of guts... ...now that they're on the other side of the world. Why do you keep filming me while lm sleeping? Because you're beautiful then. What's so beautiful about a sleepyhead? Everything. What are you doing? Homework. I have to design a pair of trousers... ...but at the Rietveld Academy trousers are not supposed to have legs. Explain how you make a design. You start with a rough idea. Like this. Then you do the model, which is this. The legs are far too long, but models always have long legs. Okay? - Super. Thank you. Wow. Great pair of trousers. What's wrong? - Beautiful. Don't you like it? - I like it very much. Really very good. But? - No buts. It's very good. Don't you believe me? Action. You're our new model, Daan. Don't sway. Very good. Come on. Keep looking. What are you doing? Do you want to play a game? I know a nice little game. Watch a film. I have lots of nice films. How's that? Are you afraid? Watch. Keep watching. Don't look the other way. Dad. - You stole them? Yes. Isnt that great? So you had them all along. Bastard. Keep watching, Daan. Baloo. Such a cheerful girl. Daan... Let it out. Its okay. Do you remember this? That was the last time. Now watch, Daantje. Watch. Look, Daan. What is that? Its your birthday. Yes. Please watch. - Don't do this. You have to watch now. - Switch it off. I don't have to see this. No, Martijn. Let go of me. We can't go on like this. You have to get through it and watch those films. Jesus, leave me alone for once. Im not leaving until you've watched them. Nice, isn't he? This one really sucks. And this one's even worse. Don't be ridiculous. Im leaving. - Wait. Daan... We're off, Ramon. See you soon. He'll take care of the house. Do you mind? Well, mister. They say you have a very cute way of kissing. That's correct. - Really? Many people tell me that. - Good for you. Its all a matter of feeling. Some people think it's a technical thing. But it isn't. Its about feeling. Passion. The pleasure that you feel. And pleasure is something you cannot hold on to. It eludes you. And I have big lips. That helps. - Can you show me? How? By kissing your mouth? - No. By kissing in the air. You wet your lips... ...open your mouth, like this... ...and stick out your tongue. Her diary. Wow. Wow. - Ramon, cut it out. I think she fancies me. Let's see what she has to say about you. Give it to me. - No, Martijn. Its personal. You know that. Is that your cheese? - Do you want some? Hi, Daantje. How did your exams go? Did you do well? It went great. They really liked my work. Fabrics and techniques went well, too. It was perfect. I told you so, girl. You can do it. Indeed: You're brilliant. Don't you agree, Martijn? Well done, Daantje. Is that all? I think you're great. - Really? Yes. And now lm going to take a leak. He's raving mad. - He reads your diary. Did you know? What? - Your diary. He reads your diary. Ramon... What have you been reading? - Reading? Me? Martijn says you've been reading my diary. I don't even have a diary. - You don't? Dear diary, Martijn's been bothering me with his camera all day. I never have a moment to myself. Dickhead. Kiss. Have mercy. - No. These are all the houses we ever lived in. Frankfurt, 1983. Would you like some tea? Martijn, do you think you could film somewhere else this evening? At Ingeborg's place, maybe? I think she has the hots for you. So what? Martijn, come on. Im not interested in Ingeborg. Bullshit. I don't love her. So what? You don't have to love a girl in order to fuck her. That's my opinion. Do you love her? What? - Do you love Daantje? Love... I don't know. So you don't. - Fuck off, man. Ramon... - Its none of his business. But it is mine. Girl, I love you. Why don't you get rid of that moron? - My brother is no moron. No. Im a moron. Call me when that film is finished. Im going to play soccer. Come on. - Fuck off. Such a pity. He's gone. And I was just getting to like him. Fucking awful. He's gone forever. Bullshit. Ramon adores me. Maybe. But do you adore him? Don't fool yourself. I know what you're using him for. Some day, you'll have to make a choice. Welcome to my shelter. - Hi, little fellow. Do you like it? This is Victor. - God, that noise. My neighbour had put him out with the garbage. He's very watchful. Obviously. So little furniture. - Im never in. Why is there so much noise up there? And this... Shut up. This is the temple. The temple of His Horniness Ramon The Terrible. You can get out now. Do you like it? - What is this? Ingeborg, hurry up and toss it. - Is it my turn? Kamchatka. Martijn. Jawohl. Alles klar, Herr Kommissar? Dass ist sicher wunderbar. Okay. - A card. You're bruising me Japan. - I wanted Japan. How sad. He's got nothing left. - Japan, Tijn. Toss it. Could you keep it down a bit? I was fucking winning, man. I was winning. You're an ant to be squashed. Go and play your stupid game. Whores keep coming and going, they're all ugly as hell. And he's an alcoholic. Im going home. - Bye. See you tomorrow. - Yeah, sweet dreams. Tijn... ...it's late. - That's good, isn't it? Time to go. For you, too. Im staying and lll haunt your mind forever. Bye, Ingeborg. Queen of the night. Wait. And now this one. Like that. Wait. Like this? What's wrong? Don't stop. - Ramon, don't stop. Don't stop. Hello. - Jesus Christ. Calm down. Stop it. Ramon, I would like to speak to my little sister in private. May I? Jesus. Your brother really is a nutcase. Daantje didn't mind my watching. Do you want to see how she looked at the camera? 'Ramon, don't stop.' Its true. Get out. That's a good boy. Daantje. I handled that well, didn't I? Are you proud of me? Where am I to sleep now? I have nowhere to go. You should have thought of that sooner. By the way, I want my key back. Now. Nice shot, Tijn. Its me. The film is finished. Can I show it to you? I thought it was finished. - It is. There it is. My masterpiece. To the right. Good. Well? Do you like it? Was that all? Goodbye, Tijn. Have fun with Prince Charming. Daantje, lm here. Is it running? Hi there, wretched little thing. What's he doing here? - Im thirsty. What makes you think you can get away with this? With what? - You know what I mean. No. I haven't the faintest. What was that slut doing in your room? What slut? I don't know any sluts. I only know well- behaved girls who order their drinks in a soft voice. And who look at me admiringly. Why do you always make jokes? - Im dead serious. You can ask Karin. Did you hear me? Okay, girl. You can tell uncle Ramon. With pleasure. Prick. I think she loves you. - I don't even know that bitch. I told you I won't let you in. - I just want to talk to you. That's no use. Think. - I keep racking my brains. Fellini, say something. - Hi, Ramon. Come on. Relax. Can't you tell me what's wrong? Its no use. Think. Go away. Haven't you heard what I said? You owe me an explanation. - I don't. You do, stupid cunt. Jesus, Daan. Open the door. Open the fucking door. Goddamn. Stop that. If he doesn't stop, lm calling the police. Its my door too, you know. Ramon, cut it out. - Let me in. Tijn, help me. Ramon, stop it. Have you gone crazy? Stop it, Ramon. Cut it out. Open the door. Don't yell at me. I want to help. - I don't need your help. You can't be serious. Deep down in your heart you must know better. Daan, look. If I were you, I would be more positive about love. Be positive. That's what it's all about. You heard her, Ramon: Be positive. - Open the door. Fake filmmaker. Jan de Bont wanna- be, open up. Bye. Damn. What the hell happened? What has that son of a bitch done? Where were you this morning? I finally got us an appointment, and I was the only one there. You said you were excited, but... What have you done? What's he doing here? - I broke up with Ramon. What? Why? - He cheated on me. With whom? Some tart with a strange hairdo. Like cotton candy. I just don't get it. I know Ramon. Ive never seen him so happy. He loves you. He'll do anything for you. I noticed last night. He'll do anything for me. Look. That's how much he loves me. Don't you see he's a prick? Ramon wouldn't do such things. Whose friend are you, Ingeborg? - Not yours. I can't understand why you let him in again. That's stupid. Why is he here? We're family. - Stop moaning. This boy is not good for you. - Are you? Okay. Should I leave? - Please do. You can't be serious. Goodbye, Ingeborg. - Bye, Ingeborg... That's a good girl. Ill see you later. When you've come to your senses, or so. Good girl. Do you remember how much? - A little more. How many cubes of sugar? Three, four? - Five. No, three. Victor. Are you happy? What is he saying? Im afraid Victor isn't very talkative. Small children really believe everything. - What do you mean? We thought this drink could make us understand animals. Both of us talked to Baloo. And I remember what he said. - Do you? What did he say? He said he had to go away for a while, but that I shouldn't miss him... ...because he would certainly come back, whatever people might say. Who are you talking about? - Does that matter? Goddamn. Martijn, do something. What should I do? Tell him it's no use. Shit. Martijn... We have to talk. All those films you make. Do you show them to your sister? - Maybe. That depends on the subject. It hurts. The past few days... - What are you doing? Tijn, shut up. It hurts. The past few days lve been thinking that... lm sorry, but this is bullshit. Fuck, I was just getting the hang of it. - You have to write it down first. Ready? Go ahead. Dear Daan. Under the circumstances I find it very difficult... It really hurts. Shit. Im sorry I was so aggressive, okay? You seem to think that lve been seeing someone else. I don't mean to be offensive, but that is absolutely ridiculous. When I have a great girl like you, why would I want someone else? I love you, baby. Im not seeing anyone else. I am no one else. Im Ramon. Your wretched little thing. Daan, please call me. Please call me. Please. That's it. Beautiful. Please show it to her. You bet, sucker. Where were you? How did it go? He won't be bothering us for a while. - What did you tell him? The truth. - You? What was all that fuss about? - I had to give you this. A poem. By Ramon. Dear Daan, under the circumstances I find it very difficult... What a load of crap. - He loves you. Don't mock him. What did I do, Daan, to deserve this cruel fate? It is sad. - Its terrible. Painful. Our Ramon. Alone. - All alone. Lonely. - Standing outside. Peek- a- boo. You can't be my little sister. They must've adopted you. Would you have liked that? That's up to you. Happy birthday to you happy birthday, dear Daantje happy birthday to you Tijn. Why do you always have to ruin everything? I have to know what I did. - Damn, Martijn. Stop it. I have to know. - Why? Aren't we happy now? Im not. Daantje, please. Tijn, why are you here? Why are you here? - Tell me where I am. Don't be silly. Why did you wake me up so early? I didn't wake you up. You woke me up. In my room? - So we're in your room. Yes. And you are going to lie in bed with me. Do you want me to? No. I think it's scary. - So why did you ask me? You asked me. Is that what they made you believe? - They didn't make me believe anything. But you are the boss, little sister. Aren't you? Im not. You are. You always do what you want. How could I be the boss? It was you, Daantje. Stop deceiving yourself. I didn't want anything. - You wanted to know. I don't want anything. - Stop denying it. Don't you know what lm talking about? - No. Cut it out. Do you want me to show you? Do you? You don't have to show me anything. I won't react anyway. What are you doing? Why didn't you ring the bell? The doorbell isn't working. Are the two of you enjoying yourselves? Why are you here, Ingeborg? What did you think of Ramon's message? What message? The video message that Martijn recorded. You know, that crap: 'What have I done, Daan? ' Is that what you mean? It hasn't changed anything. Why not? He's still a cheater. Plain and simple. Why won't you talk to him? Don't be so hard on him. Ill tell you again: He cheated on me. I didn't make that up. Stop bullshitting. Leave me alone. - Give him a chance. I know how to live my own life. Stop interfering and leave me alone. Leave me alone. - Think about what you're doing. Shut the fuck up and piss off. Get lost. Well done, Daantje. - You shut up as well. Why didn't you show me Ramon's video message? I want to show you my films. - I want to watch that video. Those films are far more important. Why do you always decide what I can watch? Show me Ramon. Now. Impossible. I erased that tape. You never erase them. - I ran out of tapes. Damn. What am I to think of this? - I did it for you. I don't want to hurt you. - Don't lie. Daantje, I want you to watch those films. Fuck off. You have to watch. You have to. Now. - Maybe tomorrow. No. Now. - Stop ordering me around. Daan... Please call me. Are you as lonely as I am? Martijn. Get up, lazy dog. - Give it to me. Beauty. Shit. Victor is gone. Fuck. - You can't find them, can you? I will find them. - What if you can't? I will find them. - Suppose you don't. Help me. - I can't. Im filming. Shit. Its you. You're behind all this. - No. Im just filming it. What do you want from me? - You know what I want. But you're too afraid to admit it. - How profound, Martijn. So who's really the boss? - Not you, loser. See. You are the boss. Try and find your tapes before someone else watches them. Have you checked under the bed? Are you looking for something? I have to look behind the counter. I just want to... Goddamn. - Moron. What are you going to do now that everything is gone? Switch that thing off. What's the use? It might as well not have happened at all. What might as well not have happened at all? Everything. For the first time in my life I had the feeling I was doing something useful. That I could put an end to the misery. - What misery? What do you think? Loneliness. Boarding school. Well said, Martijn. But why are you deceiving me? Am I deceiving you? - Don't you know what lm talking about? Is this what you were looking for? Switch that thing off. - Nice footage, Martijn. I would miss the astonished look on your face. If we don't film you... ...you'll say this hasn't happened at all. - Yes, tiny tiny tiny Tijn. Shit. Goodbye, Tijn. You're her little brother, aren't you? - Piss off. Extremely beautiful. I bit Daantje. - It was a hickey. You didn't bite her. What was that? - Nothing. Amazing. Did you see the audience? Did you look at them? I really had to boost Daantje. - It was great. Ramon, give the camera to me. I also want to film. Women should not film. - Give it to me. Aren't you going to let me in? How did you like the show? Why are you here, Daantje? Im here to wake you up. Its my birthday. Lie down. You're still asleep. Between the sheets. Tijn... ...I have a question for you. I want to know about Claudia. What do you do with her... ...when you don't want me around? Why do you want to know? Do you kiss? We do. What are the kisses like? They are long kisses. How? Like that. And what does she do? The same. - In the air as well? No, silly. She touches me. Show me. Mom and dad can come in any moment. - Im the boss. And what happens next? That's it. - No, it isn't. It is. Claudia has breasts. So you make love, don't you? We do. Sometimes. Show me. Im the boss. - They can come in any moment. I want to know. Its my birthday. You have to lie on top of each other. Go ahead. You have to undress first. You first. Then what? I don't know. This is it. What do you mean? Is that all? It is. - So you just lie like this. Yes. You really didn't know what to do next? No. How should I know? And Claudia didn't know either? She was even more nervous than I was. I never went any further than this. Im so sorry. Knives. Ive got very sharp knives. Really sharp. What kind of tapes are those? - Used videotapes. You can re- record them. You can use them again. What's on them? - I never watch old tapes. I don't have the time for that. Why should I watch somebody else's films? It seems fun to me. - No. Some of the people who make videos are really odd. Everybody buys a camera and starts filming these days. Absolutely crazy. They all think they are good at making films. Really, you can use them again. It doesn't cost a penny to... Simply remove those record tabs. And then you can re- record them. How much are they? The whole lot. The whole box? 25 guilders. - Come on, they're used. Alright then. Make it ten.
