Hey Sanne. Is everything alright? At home? Yes, Well. What can I say? If you Want to talk about it... Talk? That doesn't help. You can always come to me. Or another mentor. I'll try to remember that when I Wipe his ass. Just kidding. If you can't take a joke there's nothing left to laugh about. Indicatif pass compos et indicatif imparfait. Which one did I forget to mention? That's indicatif plus-que-parfait. The next assignment is to determine the infinitif. We'll do so on page quatre-vingt seize. And What is that in Dutch? Jochem? Didn't you bring your book? - I thought I did. But you didn't. - I packed it this morning. I hate students who Won't bring their book. I hate them even more if they lie about it. Troi. You can leave now. - But I know I... David, can you give me the answer? Alors, I don't have all day. Past perfect tense. How long have you been standing there? You have an amazing voice. Are you an expert? I have a band. Punt Uit. I heard of you. What's that to do with me? Maybe you'd like to come and listen. Or better yet, sing? Okay, let me think about it. Here's my number. I'm David. I'm Nienke. Let's take your picture. Excuse me. I'll text you. You owe me a book. What a lousy thing to do. You think so? I also thought it was so sad. But David, you could have stood up. You could have said you had his book. But you didn't. Good going. Is that how she manipulates you? - Worse. You should thank her. - For What? He has detention for three days. She saved you. - And you know it. I'm came to return Jochem's textbook. Come in. Are you in his class? Yes. Have some, that's What they're for. He's with that girl. Vera. I don't know her and it's none of my business. A girlfriend would do him good. Do you have a girlfriend? - No. That's good to hear. I thought he was the only one who didn't... Well, What do I know. I'd be happy for him. I really have to... Here's his book. Thanks for bringing it by. You're David, right? I'll tell him you were here. Come back anytime. It's nice to meet a classmate. Here. - Thanks. What's that? Oh that? I sat too close to a fire once. It suddenly started shooting sparks. That's terrible. Do I need to bury you? Oh no, it's still alive. What time is it? Don't Worry, it's Saturday. I have a little job for you. Be ready in fifteen minutes. You've slept long enough. Your mom Works, so I have to do everything. Do you know What time it is? It's Saturday. I asked What time it is, not What day. Time to hire a maid. Kids have no discipline. When I was young you'd practice until you dropped. Nowadays they come home and stop practicing. You can't learn the piano Without practice. You're not listening. Yes I am. You were talking about discipline. One of them can go straight to the conservatory. He comes twice a Week and practices at home. Cinema tonight? A rare talent. There. Beef roll? I'll just have some vegetables. But you always like these. I'll just have some vegetables. Daddy made such a nice meal. Did you see Niels and Youssef? No, not yet. How are you? Good. And how's Jochem? I don't know. Why? I heard you see each other often. Oh yes, at the shelter. He's adopting a dog. I Work there. Hey, I heard We have a new rock chick? I just told Niels. Is she hot? Didn't you take her picture? You have her picture? Show us. Come on. She's smoking hot. And speaking of beautiful ladies... Look, our new band member. Is she hot or not? - Be honest. She is, isn't she? Did you have fun tonight? I have to Write about local schools. My boss mentioned your school. Don't even think about it. What better source of inside information? I Wouldn't be able to show my face anymore. You exaggerate everything. You underestimate everything. Look at your new job. It's Saturday, midnight. And you're still Working. You're right, I must be crazy. I'll tell my boss there's a conflict of interest. Write some praising stories. That's What people Want to read. But is it the truth? Everybody loves their own school. That's enough guys. We don't Want to cripple him. You're not rid of us yet. You still have to pay for my shirt. Jochem do you Want some tea? No I have homework. Mrs Smit speaking. This is Jochem. I hurt my hand so I can't come for a While. I'm sorry to hear that. Hold on. Let's hear it with our music. I Want to Walk on clouds I Want to drink on the moon I Want to dance with the stars and stand on the sun. Yeah, baby take me with you No Worries, nobody around Sometimes I'm fed up and need to be alone Good, stop. I've heard enough. We have a new singer. Didn't I tell you? Sorry guys, but I'm not convinced. You sound like Phoebe from Friends. Are you tone-deaf? You're great. Really very good. Was it them again? I'm calling the principal. - Don't. I don't Want to be the school dork. I'll call you in sick. Until you feel better. What can I do to comfort you? Do those bastards know What they're taking away from us? What will you call him? Simbad. Nice. Unusual. Shall We fill out the forms? What's that on yourjaw? I had my Wisdom tooth pulled. Nothing serious. Focus, come on. Ready? Vera is at bat. Take positions. Youssef. To the back. - Come on. Great! Very nice Vera. Sorry. It's alright. Do you know What's up with Jochem? He had his Wisdom tooth pulled. That doesn't take two Weeks. Shall We go see him? You and me? Yes. See his new dog? Go with Nienke. Look Who's back. Our slice of pork. I don't think anybody missed you. You still have an outstanding debt. Remember? Nod. Good boy. Look at those hard Workers. A sight for sore eyes. And so very quiet. It's a bit frightening. Can I have your attention? Class party in two Weeks. We'll have it at my house. Casa el Tino. I'll take care of the barbecue and you can handle the rest. Beer! no alcohol. Don't be childish. Out of the question. If I see it I must say something. And I don't see so Well, so... Seriously, no alcohol. There's more news. The group photo. One for you. And the portrait I took of every one of you. It is a stunner, if I do say so myself. And Jochem, here you go. I'll get the order forms for extra prints. What a nice picture Jochem, very becoming. Really handsome. - Indeed. I'd like to have one for my diary. I'll out it out and paste it in there. How do you like that? When I think about you I can look at it. Look, isn't that fun? Give it a nice border. Very professional. Here rests Jochem. V\th a cross. R. I.P. Stop it. You think it's funny? I do. I understand it's not funny when you love Porky. Shut up. Shack up in a pigpen. I'll make you a large hay bed. Better make that extra large. Who'll shack up in a pigpen? Vera and Jochem. It's just a bit of fun. Some humor. Why do you put up with it? Your victim role provokes them. That's Why they Won't stop. Now I have to deal with it. Are you coming? Is Jochem here as Well? Jochem? You always do homework together. Next up is Bas Keizer, the small pile there. Mees Larsen. Here, this one's yours. Sign before you leave. Justin van der Lek. Is your friend still sick? - Yeah. That pile is yours. Ine Meyer. Hi David, What brings you here? I'll be right back Mom. Tell me What you Want but you're not Justin van der Lek. Piss off David. You're doing Justin's paper round. It doesn't concern you. We're supposedly doing homework together. Those guys are going too far. They promised to stop tormenting me. Once I paid my debt. And you believe them? When are you done? Saturday. If they break their promise I'll help you. I must go now. Did you finish that school article? Why are you asking? No reason. Yes it's finished. Now I have to Write about day care centers. What's going on? It's Saturday. I have a small job to do. I'm helping you today. Don't you have anything better to do? No. You? Come, give me half. Thanks for helping. You're Welcome. I had fun. Do you have plans for tonight? I have band practice. Why? No reason. I figured maybe We could do something. Like What? - Nothing special. I'll see you tomorrow at the party. You're coming, aren't you? This is my third school. You Want to give them the satisfaction? And myself some peace. I'll help you, remember? If you have a solution I'd like to hear it. Music is my answer to everything. I Want to Walk on the clouds I Want to drink on the moon Dance with the stars and stand on the sun This is my space Take me with you No Worries and nobody around me. The sausages aren't ready yet. Here you go. Chicken? One? That's not a lot. Can I have some chicken? I bought organic meat for you. You thought of that? I'll have some. How many? - Three. You brought Simbad! Hi Simbad. How is he? He is fine. And you? Did you teach him tricks? No. What's Wrong? Why? - You're acting strange. I'm in love. Really? V\th Whom? V\th you. I know. I Wish I Wasn't. I think you're really nice. I know you better now. I like talking with you but... I'm sorry. I understand. I'm revolting. No, that's not true. I'm in love with somebody else, that's What's in the Way. You have no feelings for me? Well, no. Not like that. What did I just say? I'm going back to the party. Hold me tight you make me feel safe Always keep me close Smile at the camera. Not now. Can I have your attention please? Something has been bothering me for a While. I think it concerns us all. So I Wrote the next song. We shouldn't be indifferent but say something about it. Let them hear our voice. Or in this case, Youssef and Nienke's. I don't know Where to start but I know if I don't I'm part of the problem Letting someone be destroyed when they cry 'stop' It's unacceptable to bully someone It's hard to put into Words but it's going too far Much too far We don't know What someone else is capable of Because We don't know What they feel Be a little less self-occupied be more aware because it helps Happiness is never far away Stay sharp even when you're occupied If you notice something it might be connected to the core of things Sometimes I'm tuned off but I can't ignore my surroundings not concerned about other's problems That's a great song. Thanks. Where's Vera? Jochem is chasing me. He said he's in love with me. That's him. Gross, you're puking in the teacher's yard. Big boys don't puke. Let's show you how gross that is. Roll the little pig. Piss off. He Won't help you. Nobody will because you stink. How was the party? I have a splitting headache. Practice, practice, practice. If you don't... Looks like you had quite a party. Sorry. Pardon? Excusez-moi, madame. - Assieds-toi. We read a text from Sartre's play 'Huis Clos'. Also known as 'No Exit'. One of Sartres ideas comes from this play. 'Hell is other people. ' What could Sartre have meant by that? I'm sorry to interrupt. It's about Jochem. I spoke his parents. They say Jochem didn't come home after the party. Does anybody know Where he could be? Did something happen at the party? Vera? Vera is in love with Jochem. That's not true. - Look how she cries. You haven't got a clue. Guys, come on. If anyone has information, they can come to see you. Of course. Thank you. I'm Worried about Jochem. How so? At the party he told me he loves me. I turned him down. So What? I Want to find him. VWI you help me? I'd like to, but not with you. Do you really have to be like this? I'm already feeling guilty. Do you know Where Jochem is? No? I thought perhaps he was with one of you. But you were in school and... I don't know who I can call. We're looking for Sanne. We're classmates. I'll call her. Sanne, you have visitors. Close the door behind you. You mind if I finish my dinner? Sanne just cooked for me. Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. Why are you here? Do you know how Jochem got so drunk? Isn't it obvious? He Went on a binge. Doesn't sound like him, does it? We saw him near the pond. The poor kid was devastated. Disappointed in love. In Vera. You were there. You could have stopped him. There was no stopping him. You rolled him around in his own puke. And What did he do? He asked David to help him, didn't he? And What did David say? He said 'piss off'. Didn't you? 'Piss off'? Maybe he took your advice to heart. Let's not point fingers. You broke his heart, you said piss off. And now you're feeling guilty. Well, good luck with that. You can let yourself out. Bye Vera, bye David. And now? I know Where We can look for him. Come. This is it. Simbad! He must be close, he Wouldn't leave Simbad alone. Simbad, Where is he? Service error. Rotate. May I have your attention? I have sad news. Jochem was found in the dune lake. Divers searched for him. It appears he drowned. All classes are cancelled. Maybe it's best if you stay together. Here, with Tino. I Wish you strength. I keep forgetting. Can you copy this DVD? It's a concert your grandma hosted. Jochem killed himself. A kid from my class. He was tormented by three bullies. He drowned in the dune lake. Sweetheart, that's horrible. How awful. Give me that DVD. I need some distraction. Can you set the table? Let's listen to him. I'm not hungry. He plays beautifully. That's Jochem. Oh no. Your mother called. Oh dear. I made him some eggs that morning. He didn't Want them. We argued about it. On the last day of his life I argued with him. He was unhappy. - He was in love. Maybe that's Why he drank so much. - They found alcohol in his blood. They shouldn't have served alcohol at that party. Jochem didn't Want to go to the party. But he did anyway. I didn't see him until I left. I don't know Why he drank so much. All I know is I didn't help him. He asked for help. And I let him down. I'll never forgive myself. I regret that. I'm really very sorry. The police told us... he'd been thinking about doing it for some time. How do they know? He kept a diary. They found it in his backpack. Sweetheart, get changed. I'm very sorry, but I have to Work. They Want a background story on Jochem. Don't Worry. I'll Write something nice. What about the truth? Bullying Cause of Suicide Now you have to do it yourself. I'm torn apart by it. But he earned you 200 euro. Yes. I'll pay that back. To Whom? His body? Stop it. How many times did he beg you to stop? A hundred times? Thousand? This Wasn't What We Wanted. Wasn't it? For once you had no control over him? What do you Want me to say? Say you regret it. I start to realize you knew something was very Wrong. And I understand What mechanism held you back. But What about the teachers? Your class mentor didn't notice anything? Why aren't you at school? I'm suspended because of the alcohol. All I drink now is coffee. I can't sleep. I was blind. I don't understand. I knew Sanne had problems. They dump it on your plate. They're just managers. They let me take the blame and they stay out of harm's Way. But they will organize a beautiful memorial service. Which I'm not allowed to attend. I gave Sanne too much space. That's my fault. Take this. Maybe you can use some of these pictures. Mom! Today We remember Jochem Steeman, who passed away so unexpectedly. One of his classmates Wants to say something. So I'd like to give the floor to David. This is my class. This is also Jochem's class. This photo was taken a few Weeks ago. But Jochem is not in it. Our class Without Jochem. But there is something of Jochem in this picture. If you look closely you'll see his clothes hanging in a tree. One of the many jokes each day was filled With. Every day there was an opportunity to bully Jochem. Our class could Write a Whole list. This is a page from Sanne's diary. She did this two Weeks ago. We all witnessed it. Nobody said something. Except for one person. Vera. She stood up for him. But did We listen? Our class party. Less than a Week ago. No alcohol was allowed. Our mentor said 'If I see it I must say something'. But he also said he doesn't see too Well. But did anybody get drunk? No. Except for one person. Not voluntarily. The evening before... he asked me if We could do something together. Like What, I asked. Nothing special. That's What We thought of him. Nothing special. That Woman is my grandmother. 'Jochem has a lot of talent. ' I didn't know that until three days ago. Jochem Wasn't Worth our time. Except in order to bully him. Bullying Cause Suicide Student You spoke like a friend. Thank you. I Wasn't a friend. I read his diary. Some things kept him afoot. Vera, the piano, Simbad. And you. You know the last thing he Wrote? It's about you. 'For the first time I feel I have a friend. He has good ideas. Like earlier today. Music is my answer to everything. Is it true? Is that enough? Tonight I'll play with that thought in my head. David gives hope. ' Sounds like a friend. Police. Regret based on the book by Carry Slee
