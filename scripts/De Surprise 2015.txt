Can I hold your hand? - Sure. Mrs. Koning, I'm sorry if I scared you. I thought... I forgive you, too. Perhaps it is not appropriate to stand here. Mr. van Alen, the truck has not turned Would probably be removed. You were completely relaxed. Did you feel the adrenaline? What? Adrenalin causes excitement. No, it's not. Come on, you're excited at least less than me. I wish excited or upset, but I did not. Nothing makes me excited. None. Can not be. Surely you have experienced? No little not scared? I'm afraid not. Admit it. I'd love to, but... Between me and the world around... Is an invisible wall. Glass. I see everything, but me nothing touches. It sounds terrible. So I decided to travel. I expected it impatiently. Thank you for a great day, Ana. It would be nice to find the upper level together by that truck. If you do not see I wish you luck up. Thank you.

So he waited for this trip. One day, his father sailed out to check kernel. After that, nobody saw him or yacht. And Jakob? Ever since his father disappeared, never no longer laughing nor crying. 36 years I never saw him angry or sad Alive But the child is closed into himself. Mother tried in various ways to help him.

During which time, Mr. van Zalen may still refuse... For any reason what so ever. - 48 hours, is that necessary? It's just a technicality, isn't it, Mr Devise? I'm sure it will work out fine.

But you're here. - Yes I am here. Something to drink? - No thanks, I do mind. What is it? None. Are you sick? I'll call the doctor. I'm healthy as an ox. Why do you want to die? Is that what you want, is'nt it? Jacob,... I was very happy in life. I know. Now it's just a dream to meet her again... With Alina. But why now? I want to be with her. Do you believe in life after death ? I just now started to think about it. So? I do not know how it looks up there. I think that if there is heaven... If there is... That would have been a great comfort to us. Sometimes I see her so clearly. Standing and waiting. I think so. I can almost touch her. You grab her arm. You look into her eyes. You dance with her. Lying next to her. Lying beside her while this death is bestowed upon us. Did'nt you recognise? True. Jacob... You have no idea how happy I am to hear that, boy. If your mother had heard this..... We need to celebrate. In the kitchen there are a few good cigars. Can you bring it? Hurry, man, life is short. You found them? - No. I do not see them, Miller. Here they are. I found them. Miller? I knew. I knew that I was his surprise. No, he spoke to us but it is not decided "surprise". He wanted to die in the presence loved one. Can I sit with him for sometime? Course. If you have such faith that can not move mountains... But have no love, I am nothing... Last week, Miller told me that , He'll miss me. Now, on the contrary, on I miss him. Here I am. Can you imagine? Do you hear me, Miller? You probably do not hear? - I hear you. Look, we may have new client. One day walk right up to the top... The next day, no one wants to hear you. You have may things to think. Do you think that we can contact him? If he wants, he will be yours. Really? How do you feel? Good. We're doing a good job. Elysium
