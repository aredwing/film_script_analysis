Is the only thing that is keeping me together. Do you understand? Everything else is... Buried deep, but... Hope... Buried here. Hello, Jimmy. Not Joseph then? Very good. Very witty. Listen. I was sorry to hear about your brother. I lost my son a year ago about, so. You might have known him. Steven Carver. We lived just off the end of the estate there. Well, he was a good few years older than you, so maybe not. - I know how you feel. - You do. Yeah. I think I do. - Was your son murdered? - No. Car accident. - Accident? - Yeah. Did you cry? Everyone keeps telling me it is good to cry. Well, if that is what everyone keeps saying, It must be okay. Must not it. You are a photographer. Yeah. I like taking pictures. There is no money in it. Some tosser nicked my camera in the summer. Went down to the crime scene the other night. You are going to have to give me a wee bit more to work on. The young lad. Terry, Grady. Why would you want to do that? I went down to see his mum. I needed a picture of him for the first print. His mum wants me to find whomever's responsible for her son's death. Well, she would. Would not she. I think we are close. Most of the estates around here have gangs. It seems Terry was on the edge of one of them. And got involved in an argument with a couple of people from another gang. And things got out of hand? Yeah. I think you could describe it like that. Why do you want to get involved? I thought you were a watcher. It is better on the sidelines. Walk away. - Didn't think you would show. - Said I would. I not did. - You want to take some pictures. - Yeah. This is somewhat old, kind of complicated. However, once you know it, you know it. You know. I had the one in school. Hold it. - Heavy. - Yeah. How do you see through it? Through here. Focus. Fuck!

Well, who would have thought it. Life in the old dog yet. - Yeah! - Chin-chin. Yeah, let us exhibit these drawings. They hugely impressed me. However, if you like the design, you have to see when she fits all the costumes and everything. It is... I mean, it is amazing. She has got this eye. It is fantastic. Thank you. I saw your piece on the... On the gang, Under-Fives. It was good. It was brief. Very good. Crazy fucking story. Only two of they ever arrested. It is difficult. Minors. It is so difficult to pin anything on. However, the scary thing is... That these kids... and that's all they are... they are just babies. They do not think what they have done is that wrong. Come on! However, it is also because they are kids. They are just reacting in addition, trying to make sense. Of the shit that is all around. However, when they cornered. Bang! It is reflex. In addition, that reflex is often just to lash out, with an eight-inch blade. I mean, look at these fucking cunts. Rolling out of the court after the riots. Not a fucking care in the world. Pimp roll, designer clobber. "Who gives a fuck" written all over their faces. Front. Bullshit front. I mean, how much shit has that led young men? Well, it never used to be like that. Yes. Oh, no. When we were kids, they were innocent times. The '70s, when you could go to a fight in addition, a football match would break out. You know, I often wonder how Steven would have turned out. He would have been fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. Rachel was saying that, He... he'd been spending a lot more time out at night when I was away. He was a teenage kid. What did you expect? Well, I hope he was happy. I hope we did enough. Everybody wants to try. In addition, protect their children from the world, but you cannot. It is... It is simply not possible. However, you try, in addition, you keep trying. You loved him, Tom. I saw the way you looked at him, the way you were with him. I mean, I am not a father, however, I could see that. Well, I wanted to be a good father. Believe me, you were. 671... William Klein. Brooklyn school kids hose them down... during a sweltering hot New York summer's day. 672... Terence Donovan.

That would be nice. However, I have still got some things to sort out. Yeah. Yeah. Message number 11. Message number 12. Message number 13. What is wrong? You needed to do it quite so early? Early bird and all that. Yeah. - Hey, Jimmy. - Here is your book. - I said you could keep that. - I do not want it. Well, you still want those slides to show your class. Who is your friend?

She had a business meeting. - Okay. I am going to get a refill. Do you want one? Do you want ...? Do you not think you are drinking too much. Tom. Who is counting? You? She thinks I am a genius. You know, I was thinking, As you, get older. You do not really get wiser. You know, you actually understand less. You do not get courageous. You just get scared. Have you called the police? Then what? You look dreadful. Well. Thank you. You look very nice yourself. Just call the police, Tom. It is just pranks. You caught shit through a letterbox. Abusive calls, a mutilated cat... You call that "pranks". Kids nowadays, they've just become so much more advanced. Have not you heard? I am worried about you. I am worried about all this, you know. Does Christina know? This is about me. It is not about her. Well, still, you know, you should talk to her. You should talk to the police as well. It is gone too far. Yeah. I Will. I Will. Really. Tom this place is a mess. Do not you have any respect? What is respect? You know. A shower and a shave every morning. See. I do not need that. I do not need people licking my face. That is where you and me differ. You know. Where is she? - Christina? - Perceptive. Well, it is not that late. Where she mean to be? She is out with a dago buyer. Okay. - Have you met him? - Yeah. Once. Yeah. Shallow. Laughs when it's not funny, cries when it's not sad. - Jealous? - No, I am not. I just want her home. You know. - Anything wrong with that. - No. No. And... How are things between you? We get by. Well, they do say... The art of making a relationship work... Is give a little bit more? Than your share. You sound like a fucking self-help book. I did my share. You know just... Just a little bit more, Tom. You know. In addition, let us face it. Whenever you did anything, there always had to be fanfares. You could never just do it. Well, you always were the humble one in the outfit. Were not you? Well, for humble, Read "doormat." What? - Just stop trying to tell me what to do. - I am not... Stop trying to be a mum! Stop trying to mother me! Because you are not a mother any more. Are you? You are not a fucking mum any more! My gosh, you can be so cruel sometimes. Tom. You know, the trouble with this stuff, it cuts away at care. I mean, look at you. You are a great advert for it. What about do you care? You are... You are like an accident Waiting to happen. Now. That is a choice turn of phrase if ever I heard one. You see. There is that Constant undercurrent. The feeling that at any point things could get out of control. Do you know, it was hard to live with. - It was scary to live with. - But you survived. - I a little bit scarred. - We all a little bit scarred. Baby. Jesus, listen to you. You spend all your time trying to blacken your own character. - Yeah, I know. Yeah. Just too many Lou Reed records. - My God! - That as real as it gets. - That is as real as it gets. Yeah. It is all surface. - You scratch it and there is nothing underneath. - It is all gone! Stop it! You can leave whenever you want. - Is that what you want? - I do not fucking care! My God! What's happened to you. You never used to be like this. This was not the way you described it in the beginning. It was not... We were good. We were. I watched as you felt your grip slips away. In addition, I could see the change. You know, I tried to help. I could not reach you. I gave up trying. Because you took it out on me. In addition, you took it out on Stephen. I am going to go. I am so sorry it ended like this. Did not hear you coming in. You all right? What is wrong? Have you been crying? Get me a drink. Why have you been crying? Just let me take your coat. I am cold. Leave it. Please. Hello, this is Tom Carver. I am not here. If you want to leave a message. Please do. This is Stanley at Maxim Publishing. We are getting a bit anxious about the deadline. Ideally we'd like to get this all tied up by the weekend. So that we can take the package to Oliver on Monday. So, if you could give me a call. I am going to lie down. - Hey, come on. - Tom. Please. - If something has happened, you can tell me. - No! - Is it something that has happened with Luca? - No! No! Is it something that he said? It is not fucking Luca. It is not fucking Luca! It is you. It is you! You have done this to me. They raped me. They raped me. They raped me. Your fucking adversaries. They raped me! Are you satisfied now? Are you? They followed me. Kids. I tried to fight. They held my hands down. They took turns. Each of them. I just wanted to survive. One of them threw that at me. They said it must be. They said it is for my boyfriend. Is that you? Is it you? Is it you? I want you to call the police. I want you to tell them exactly what has been going on. Will you do that for me? I have given her something to help her sleep. I would not expect too much too soon. Thank you. Have you got her initial statement? - Yeah. Gilmore took it all down. - Okay. I would leave anything else until tomorrow. She is still very fragile. - Of course! - Okay. Thanks. Want to tell me more about this. How is she? How do you think? Have the police spoke to her. Yeah. Took a statement. Said they'll speak to her in more detail tomorrow. Did you speak to Penton? - Yeah. - And? Just told him everything. He said it's going to be hard if Christina cannot identify any of them. She can. They were all wearing masks. What about the fucker who spat in your face? Yeah. I could probably find him. They would pull him in for questioning, but... Where would that leave you? I brushed off that kid, In addition, here we are. I have seen them dealing, openly. I saw four of them outside a house in Caldwell Street. They had a sports bag. There were four of them. Then there were two of them. Then 20 minutes later there were four of them again. That house robbed that night. Yeah. You should show this evidence to the officer investigating the break-in. Look, do you think that any of these could be involved in Christina's attack? I have no idea. The only motive we have... Is the altercation at the flower stall With the as-yet-unidentified youth. - Well, if you find him... - We will want to speak with him. About his whereabouts last night. Definitely. But if you're asking me whether This evidence in itself... Is likely to lead to A charge and a conviction, It is unlikely. For fuck's sake! You have a motive. Of sorts. And the evidence At the crime scene. It is a matter of finding the right boy. If we can place him in the right place last night, If there's enough evidence from the Scene to match his profile. However, we cannot haul every kid in off the street. There is a kid everywhere. You think one of these lads in there Is the boy at the flower stall? - Yes. - You shown this to Mr. Carver. Yeah. He does not recognize any of them. Then we are still looking. We now have Mr. Carver's description of the boy at the flower stall. Get some sleep. If I'm right, they'll show themselves. Leave it with us. You little shit. Listen now. - Stay the fuck away from here. - Do you know what is going to happen to you? - The same that happened to your fucking brother. - And that girl? - That is going to happen to you. - Fuck off! - What? - Listen, you best fucking stay away from here. - Let me go! - Shut up! What is going on? - Let me go! Let me go! - Are they your mates? - What was going on there? - Nothing. I have to go home. Leave me alone, will you. - What is this? - Nothing. - Who were those kids? - I do not know. Look, I am going to ask you a question. Okay. A very important question. - Leave me alone. They will kill me. - Who will kill you? - You know the woman who lived with me. - The one who gave me the book? No, the woman I lived with. The woman who attacked. I do not know anything about that. I am trying to help you! You are not helping me. You are hurting me. Let me fucking go! Fuck. Fuck. Come back! Fuck. Come back! Hello. Hello, boys. Shit. Fucking hell. You little fucking beauty. You are fucked, son. It is not going to stop. Not now. Not now, they have done this. So what is next? It is you or they. Do you have to be so dramatic? It is not about being dramatic. It is about closure. Ending it. If that Is what you want, I am there for you, Tom. Yeah, I know. Whatever it takes. I know. Well, if you want it, It is there. Yeah. You described him to me. Yeah. I found him. I am telling you, it is he. If you do nOt believe me, Look. You know, you should hand those to Penton. He can pull him in. See what he has to say about it. Yeah. Then what? What do you think we are talking about. They are minors. They will locked up in a facility. With wide-screen, cable TV. Xbox, state-of-the-art Fucking gym. Better education than they will get out in the real world. Comfort. That is all they will fuck get. Listen, Tom. How many times are you going to let these little fuckers piss on you.
