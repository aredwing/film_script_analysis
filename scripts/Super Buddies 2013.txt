The last Ring of Inspiron! Wow, this is awesome! I have the whole set, Gramps! Way to go, Bartleby! Gramps, I'm just not good enough. How can I become a super comic book writer if I can't even come up with one super idea? All you have to do is practice, kiddo. I mean, I didn't become a farmer extraordinaire overnight, did I? And I happen to think that you're very, very talented. Well, at least I have one fan. Two. Hanging around the farm all summer... Well, that's gonna be pretty cool, right? But not as cooI as this. - For me? - Yes, sir! Issue number one! The first ever Kid Courageous and Captain Canine! I can't believe this! How did you ever find this? Well, I've got my ways. Well, your ways are awesome! Okay, you ready, Budderball? "Protected by the five power Rings of Inspiron. " All that changed... when the evil commander Drex attacked... seeking to capture the Sacred Rings. Captain Megasis, you must take the Rings to safety. There! It's the most distant habitable planet we know of! But it's far too dangerous... I may never see you again. Don't worry, my princess, I will return to marry you. Megasis sped towards Earth. Drex's ship fired on the Inspiron ship. Megasis' ship was starting to weaken. But Megasis had a plan... He placed the Rings in a torpedo and deactivated it. Playing dead, Captain Megasis lured Drex in... and fired two torpedoes. The first was a direct hit and the second narrowly missed and flew directly towards Earth with the Rings of Inspiron! You'll never get the Rings... Drex. Megasis rammed his vessel into the Darkonian ship. The Rings... No! "Drex thought that Captain Megasis and the Rings were gone for good. " But Captain Megasis'plan had succeeded... and he managed to escape in a damaged pod, heading in the same direction as the torpedo... which crashed somewhere on planet Earth. Uh-oh. Huh. I wonder what brings Sheriff Dan and Sniffer here. Hey, hey! - Hey, Sheriff Dan! - Hey! Surprise! Happy Birthday! Surprise! - Happy birthday, Bartleby! It's the birthday boy! Oh, sweet mama! You look like superheroes! Yeah. Too bad we don't have real superpowers, dawg. Haven't you read Kid Courageous and Captain Canine? Superhero rule number one, you don't have to have superpowers to be a superhero. Wow, this is awesome! Thanks for coming to my gramps' farm to celebrate. You guys look great! Where is your gramps, anyway? Evildoers, beware! The amazing Grandpa-Man is here! - Look at that! That's so cool! - Cool! Nice! Whoa! - That was so cool! - Dude! That was major sweet! Are you okay? Whoa! Gramps, you okay? Oh-ho, sure. Except for my hip, maybe. But it's Grandpa-Man! You don't wanna give my secret identity away, do you? - Surprise! - Another gift? Well, you're only 12 once, kiddo. Huh? Wow, Grandpa-Man, you rock! And look, Budderball, there's one for you, too! Come on, Budderball! All right, who's ready for the Super Bartleby Birthday Treasure Hunt? Treasure hunt? O-M-G, I love treasure! I don't think he means real treasure, dogette. Behold, Super Bartleby and Super Budderball! Whoa! That is so cool. All right, gang, let's split up into teams of two. When you hear the sound of the bugle, the hunt begins. Okay! A circular object... I've an idea, come on! - Aw, sweet! - Come on, boys! The hunt is on. Meet back at the barn. I don't know about you dudes, but I'm going for an epic mud bath. Let's go! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude and dudettes, this is blowing my mind. Where is all the mud? Armer-fay Arvin-may crubbed-say u-say lean-cay or-fay he-tay arty-pay, Udbud-may. Whoa! Slow down, Curly, bro. I know I look like one of your tribe, but I'm still learning pig latin. What Curly said, dear, was Farmer Marvin cleaned us for the party and then drained the mud so we would look our very best. Whoa. Brochacho! That is a mega-colossal bummer. Dudes, when water mixes with dirt, mud will co-exist. Awesome! Catch you on the flip side, dudes! Oh, sweet mama! That was amazing! Gracias, young Budderball! That's a 200-pound barrel. I just threw it 15 feet. Imagine what I could do to a matador! Ol! I wish some of your brawn could wear off on me. I'm a bull, you're a puppy. I come from a long lineage of fighting toros. Your job is to be cute and cuddly. Don't get me wrong, I like being a puppy. I just wish I could be strong and brave like you. It's all in the confidence, pup. But I could see about getting you a nose ring. Um, no, thanks. Right now, I'm on the lookout for some treasure. See you later, Mr. Bull! An egg is a circular object, B-Dawg. Why don't you go get one? I would, but, you know, I just don't wanna get the chicken pox. B- Dawg, you don't get chicken pox from chickens. If you're too scared, I'll go. This dog is not afraid of nothin', let alone some scrawny chickens! Yo, yo! Alpha dog in the house. We have a visitor. You think you can just waltz in here like that? - What does he think he's doing? - 'Scuze me. What exactly do you think you're doin'? - Nothing? - You best put that egg back now! - You heard what she said. - Put that back. On second thought, I didn't think. Seriously, young pup, you think you're gonna walk into my hen house and steal one of my sisters' eggs? Mmm-mmm! - Ain't happenin'. No way. Uh, I'll just mosey on. We're cool, right? I think I better teach this youngin a lesson. - Ladies, charge! - Let's get him! Run, dogs! Giant chicken in the house! I'm flying the coop! Oh, brother. What a chicken. Om... Empty your mind of all worldly thoughts. We're cows. Our minds are always empty, Buddha. I'd love to stay with you enlightened beings, but I need to meet my brothers and sis. Hey, Strawberry. Hi, Lollipop! Look at you, Rosebud. Your outfit is out-of-this-world fantastic! It just screams girl power. Girl power is a state of mind. But, you're right, the outfit so does not hurt. We gotta neigh it out loud and proud, girlfriend. Us girls ain't horsin' around. We can do anything we put our minds to. You got that right. Well, I'd love to stay and chew the hay all day. But I've got treasure to hunt. T-T-Y-L! T- T-Y-L, Rosebud! - There's gotta be something in here. - Treasure-schmeasure! All I've found so far is a bunch of chicken feathers. Look, Buddies, in there! Something is glowing! Let the dirt maestro unearth it. Whoa. Those look just like the Rings of Inspiron from my Puppy Chow! Why'd he just leave them here in a pile of dirt? Maybe Gramps buried them, and that's what we're supposed to find on this treasure hunt. I don't know, Budderball, looks like they've been here for years. Dude, do the rings from your food float? Oh, sweet mama! It's the birthday cake bugle! That dude can sure move for food. Yes! Cake! Oh-ho, there you guys are! Well, blood-sugar needs to be taken care of and that means cake! Yeah! Awesome! Whoa. Budderball, you found my extra set of dentures. I've been looking all over for those. Thank you, big fella! Hey, the Rings of Inspiron! Budderball, did you find them in my bag? Have you been collecting them without telling me? I hope you superheroes haven't had too much cake. I think it's time for ol' Grandpa-Man here to take care of some farm chores. - Happy birthday, kiddo. You're the best, Gramps. I'll check back on you all in a little while. Check it out, guys. The first issue of Captain Canine written by Jack Schaeffer. Budderball and I started it this morning. It tells us how Kid Courageous and Captain Canine met! CooI, dude. Let's see it! Okay, we're at a really exciting part. You guys ready? Yeah. Afraid of capture, Captain Megasis made sure there was no evidence of his landing and disintegrated his damaged pod. Intruder! Identify yourself! Greetings, human. Captain Megasis of the 23rd Quadrant, planet Inspiron. I come in peace. Oh, thank goodness. Not that I was scared or anything. Uh-oh, it sounds like they're coming for me. Earthling, may I shape-shift into your form? I need to disguise myself. It won't harm you, I promise. Okay. If it doesn't hurt, I guess I'm... Whoo! That kind of tickles! Looks like this is my new shape until I can find the Rings and turn myself back. Captain Megasis, now in the shape of a dog, slipped undetected past the blockade to begin his search for the Rings. Not sure where to begin looking, he wandered down a dirt road. Whoa! Oh, that hurt. This just isn't my eon. Whoa. Did you just talk to me? Yes. Doesn't this life-form speak? Because my research concluded that human beings spoke in words just like us. But you're not a human. You're a dog. I'm a human. - Are you sure about that? - Yes. Hmm, then I have erred. My name is Captain Megasis from the planet Inspiron. I just crash-landed and I took the form of some Earthling, not human, I now gather. I'm Jack. If you help me, then I can help you. When you meet my mom, remember, dogs don't talk. - They bark. - They what? - Bark. "Woof, woof!" Like that. - Woof, woof. - Jack! There you are. - Mom! - What happened? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Woof... Woof, woof. Where did you find this dog? He helped me. He looks tired and hungry. Can we keep him? Dad would've wanted us to. Oh, the smell of wet dog. Dad used to say, "If you give a lost dog a bath, he'll never leave. " Okay, I guess we'll be testing your father's theory. Thanks, Mom. Over the next few weeks, Megasis told Jack his story. And Jack, who loved to draw, chronicled it in a comic book. The Darkonians enslaved the Inspirons, and now I must find the Rings to free my people. While searching for the Rings, Jack and Megasis decided to become superheroes and fight crime in honor of Jack's late father. From now on, you'll be Captain Canine. And you shall be Kid Courageous. You know, without the Rings, I don't have superpowers, right? My dad always said, "You don't have to have superpowers to be a superhero. " We'll use our intellect, bravery and wits. I bet I would've liked your father. He sounds like a wise man. He was the best. And you know what? We can use his old police radio to save people and bring evildoers to justice. Bank robbery in progress. Three hostages. All units, report. You wanna do this, Captain Canine? And so our adventure begins! Whoa! That's so cool. And that's how Kid Courageous and Captain Canine came to be. The rumor in the comic book world is that everything that Jack Schaeffer wrote in these comics is real. Jack, the Rings. Someone's found them, they've been activated. What? Really? Well, I'm getting a signal, but it's intermittent. I can't quite track the location. We haven't had a signal in years, since that false alarm in 2002. I'd better make sure this is the real thing. Time to break the fast with a morning snack. Whoa, what's happening to me? Whoa! How did I get this strong? Pepperoni! If you are what you eat, I'm about to become hot and spicy! - Budderball! - Whoa, boy. What happened? Looks like we can use a new icebox, huh? Billy, make sure you take out the garbage. All right. Be right back, Dawg. Oh, baby, slamma-jamma dunk! B- Dawg! How'd you get up there? Om... - Om... - Om... Ah! Oh, that gives new meaning to "Downward Dog. " Nothing like a fresh pile of manure. - Bath time! - Oh, no. Has it been a month already? I'm cornered. Must hide. Must hide! Mom says she can smell you from the kitchen. Where are you, dude? You can't see me? I'm invisible? This is totally radical. I'll never have to bathe again! Oh, no. Sprinklers! There you are! Sorry, dude, but Mom will want me to add soap to that water. You guys, I'm open! Come on, guys, remember your defense! Come on! Move that ball! That's it! Hey! That was a foul! No foul. That's a goal! Now, that's one for girl power. It's really happening. I verified everything. The Rings have been activated. This is real, Jack. - Where are they? - Somewhere close to us. Slightly northeast. Not too far, but we can't pinpoint exactly where yet. We need a stronger activation. Trouble is if we're getting a reading, that means Drex can, too. Oh, Commander Drex, sir? I thought I said no interruptions, Monk-E! I'm still ruing the day I lost the Rings of Inspiron forever! Oh, yes, Commander. I realize that, but that's just it. After all this time, I mean, we have had a faint signal. But that's impossible! They were destroyed when that fool Megasis rammed my ship and perished. Well, you see, the signal came from the 49th Quadrant. A green and blue planet we have located called Earth. Megasis must have sent them there before he disintegrated along with his ship. Monk-E, we must leave at once! Ooh, the glory of exploration! Oh, I'll prepare your space pod immediately, sir. Budderball! 'Sup with the 911 howl, dawg? The reason I called this emergency meeting is... Well, I noticed something strange. Where are MudBud and Rosebud? What do you mean, dude? I'm right here. Whoa. It keeps happening to me, bro. Here one minute, gone the next. Sis is fashionably late, as usual. Nope. Right on time. It's like I'm so fast that everything is so last season by the time it gets to me. Hold on, I just remembered I forgot the hat that I wanted to wear that totally complements my bow. Playa, please! And you dawgs call me motor-mouth. There! Much better. Whoa! That dudette's got mega-speed. That's just it. Something very strange is happening to me, too. I'm strong like a bull, just like I always wanted to be. Buddha, anything odd going on with you? I'm finding myself to have excellent mind control. More than I ever imagined I could. I'm able to move things with my mind, including myself. Uh, maybe we should test your skills out. Can you levitate that hot dog into my mouth? Om... Okay, that is the best trick ever! So, we're just waiting on those hot dogs, dear. Ma'am, I just gave you one. Before you go crowning Buddha top dawg, B, check this out. It is mustard you like? Oh! My purse! I know I'm usually super-fly, but, dawgs, now I'm super-duper-pooper-scooper-fly, yo! Wait a sec, did you guys just see that? B- Dawg totally saved the day! I did? I mean, of course I did. B- Dawg always saves the day! Seriously, dudes. These Rings have given us some epic powers! Just think of the good we can do. We can protect our humans from those with bad karma. This is perf! We love making Fernfield a better place to live. Like superheroes for real, dawgs! Captain Canine says, "Superhero rule number two, "a superhero must always conceal their true identity "to protect the ones they love. " Those superhero suits Gramps gave us are really gonna come in handy. What are we waiting for, dudes? Time to be super! Fernfield, no more fear. The Super Buddies are here! Whoa, look! Super Puppies! All we need now is someone to rescue. Help! Someone help! Dawgs, that's my cue. I call first dibs on saving 'em! Let's go! Help me! Somebody, please help! Uh, I'm stuck up here. Cute costumes and all, but really, why don't you go fetch one of your human friends that can really help me? Shocker. A cat with attitude. Oh, I'll give you some cattitude. You ain't seen nothing, dog friends. This one's all yours, B-Dawg. Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up, back up. I ain't helping no darn cat. No way, no how. You can't refuse to help someone because you don't like them, B-Dawg. Superhero rule number three, a superhero is a friend to any being in need of rescue. How we gonna get that cat down, dawgs? I can't be rescued by a smelly dog. Yuck! Uh, I got it. If we can't get to the cat, then we'll just get the cat to us. We got a 10-66, Sniffer. Cat stuck in tree. Whoa, Nelly! - Oops. Saved by a dog. Now that's a cat-astrophe. There she is! Let's go! Well, at least the cat's safe. Maybe we need to practice a little bit more. Pshaw. You talking about practice? Practice is for posers, yo! Oh, no. Help! It's looking like a small town named Fernfield. To think I've been this close all these years. I'd better go and check this out. You stay here and monitor the readings. I've got to find whoever has the Rings before Drex gets the signal, if he hasn't already. Guys, something's wrong. The candy store is never open at night. I know the hours like the back of my paw. Unbellevable! Sweet candy! Okay, here we go, 20, 40... Guys, somebody is robbing the candy store. Yummy. Huh? Aw! Look at the cute puppies with the superhero costumes! Yeah. Pretty scary guard dogs, Mr. Swanson. Oh, I'm shaking in my boots! Dudes, does anyone else get the sense we're not being taken seriously here? Welcome to the world of a blonde pup. They're gonna have to learn a lesson in girl power. - Tom? - Awesome! - Way to work it, Rosebud! - All right! Watch what happens when super-strength and gumballs mix. What's he doing? What? No! - Sweet! - Awesome! - Help me! Hurry up! Quick! - Stay... Stay back! - Stay back! What are you doing? Stay back. Stay back or I'll dice you into wiener schnitzels. - Okay. Okay. Here we go. - Quick! Time to reach out and touch somebody, dawg. Take it easy. Who's a good puppy? Dude, there's only one way to teach this guy a lesson. Where'd he go? Oh, oh, oh! Dang, that is a super-wickedie-wedgie, dawg! Om... I'm so scared! What? What? So gross! Subdued by caramel, dude. Om... It's in my eyes! This is all your fault, all of it. I promise I'll be good! What's happening? I think our work here is done. Oh, I better untie Mr. Swanson before we go. It's so sweet and sticky! - Let's roll, dawgs. - Hurry! Who were they? The door is ajar. The door is ajar. Okay. I mean... Hey! Stop right there! Freeze! You are under arrest! - Put your hands behind your back! - Uh-oh. No, Sheriff. The thieves are inside! No, no, Sheriff! You've got the wrong man. It's me! Look, it's Mr. Swanson. This is my candy store. Oh, hey, Mr. Swanson. How are you? Sorry about that. Honest mistake. Yeah. Yeah. Hey! Hey! Good work, Deputy! Okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Please, take us to jail. Just keep us away from those crazy puppies! Yeah, yeah! Those puppies, they aren't normal! Let's move it. It's history unfolding, like, now. This is Sofia Ramirez from Fernfield Local News, live on the scene where a sweet robbery has just been thwarted. Sheriff Dan, can you please give us the gritty details on what went down here tonight? Deputy Sniffer and I have to go through all this dellcious evidence before we can come to any conclusions. If you'll excuse me, ma'am. Mr. Swanson. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would never believe it. They were super puppies. Well, there you have it, folks. It seems a group of super puppies have saved the day. Who are these pup crusaders? Stay tuned for the latest developments on this incredible story. Super puppies? - Super puppies. - Seriously? I have to get out of this small town. Now, let's go! Excuse me? Hey! Can you... Monk-E, what is this place? Earthlings refer to it as a farm. It's where they produce a vital substance of nutrition called food. I'm so excited to explore another planet, Commander. Monk-E, I suggest you get comfy because you're not going anywhere. You're going to stay right here with our ship and protect it from Earth creatures. - Oh, space fudge! - Hush, Monk-E! Aye aye, Commander. Good luck finding the Rings. Mmm, tasty. Ah, ugh. Disgusting. I'll body snatch this human life-form and disguise myself as one of them. Commander, according to my research, that's not a human. It's a... Be quiet, Monk-E. Phew, what a stench. Sooey! Pigs! Hello, little piggies! Good morning to ya. Ugh, yuck! What in the blazes is that? I am Commander Drex, feared leader of the Darkonian race. You are to forfeit this planet and the five Rings of Inspiron. Monk-E, make the pod disappear. Copy that, Commander. One set of candy lips. Mmm. Fern... Fernfield Sheriff's Department. - It's Marvin. - Marvin! - You gotta get over here! - What's that? There's a UFO on my farm! Now, slow down. Calm down, Marvin. What... A green pig talked to me, for crying out loud! - Okay. all right. - Come quick! I'm on my way. Monk-E, what is this spacecraft? It's what they call a pick-up truck. They come in lowrider, semi and monster. Apparently, it doesn't fly, and you must actually steer it with your hands. Er, um, hooves. I'm not surprised these Earthlings use such horrendous ground ships. Monk-E, what is the current location of the Rings? In astronomical units, they are very close. You just need to follow that yellow line and you should locate them. - Sniffer, that looks like Marvin's truck. - Huh? This music alone is enough to justify destroying the whole planet. Whoa! Look out! Watch where you're going there... Road hog! What the... - Phew. - Huh? Come on, Sniffer! Sheriff? Are you sure it's you? I think I'd know if I weren't me, Marvin. All right. Well, the spaceship is over there in the pig pen. Come on. Have a look-see. I think you might wanna start wearing a hat. Sounds to me like you got a little too much sun on the ol' noggin. Well, you believe me, right? It's not that I don't want to believe you, but why don't you just go on inside and put your feet up a little bit while Deputy Sniffer and I collect some evidence in your smelly, old pig pen? Huh? Yeah. Greetings, fellow allen. Good afternoon, sir! And welcome to Galaxy Burger. I need your help getting the Rings of Inspiron. Onion rings? Onion? Why would I want rings from the planet Onion, you bubblehead? Did you say you want the Hubble hamburger with those rings? A Hubble hamburger? What is this nonsense, you insolent allen? Um, sir, if you don't eat beef, we also have the Orion's Belt Blaster pork sandwich. - Hey, Sheriff Dan! - Hiya, kids! Is everything okay? Uh, well, just a little misunderstanding is all, nothing heavy. Your grandpa thought he saw an unidentified flying object in the pig pen. Well, I know a lot about allens. Let's go investigate. Be carefuI. Sheriff Dan, this is Myrtle at dispatch. Come in, over. Sheriff Dan and Deputy Sniffer at your service! We got a 10-53 on Main Street. We're on our way, Myrtle! Huh? Hold on to your hat, partner! Just a bunch of muddy pigs and mud pies. Gross. Ugh, ew, Bartleby, what are you doing? It's all right, folks. Nothing to see here. Sheriff Dan has it all under control. Holy pork chops, pigs can drive! Not well, but they can drive. Ah-ha, confident, authoritative, adorned with idiotic facial hair... He must be the leader. Quick, Deputy Sniffer, my lasso! Let's hog-tie this here pig. I've heard of green eggs and ham before, but never just the green ham! Oh, no! Hold tight, Deputy. Time! Holy Dinah! That was faster than my record at the Fernfield Grand Prix rodeo! You have the right to remain silent. Listen, you... What happened here, Sheriff? Was this somehow in connection to any of the strange events that have happened in our quaint town of Fernfield? Loose pig run amuck, or out of the muck, I should say, now captured! Reign of terror over. He won't be bothering any pretty ladies like you anymore. Clearly, folks, this isn't Sheriff Dan's first rodeo. Fernfield's safe once again. Hmm. Uh-oh, under siege! - There's something here... - What is it? I think I feel some kind of a button. Whoa! - Look at that! - Epic! Okay, what would Commander do? Ho-ho-ho. - I know! - That symbol on the side of the ship, I've seen it somewhere before! Earthling, this may come off as a little shocking, but I do come in peace. Bartleby, are you okay? - What was that? - Let's get him out of this mud! Yo, where'd it go? Something weird is going on. Wait, I know! Come on! Gross. It would seem appropriate that I do some exploring. That's the reason I enrolled in space schooI in the first place. If Professor Bananamunch could see me now. Oh, greetings, Earth beings! I'm honored to visit your beautiful-looking and interesting-smelling planet. Oh, I'm flattered, but you're not really my type. Help! help me! Help! Help! Oh, no! That girl is in real trouble. We need to help her. The Super Buddies are in high demand, yo! - What did this town do without us? - Sit tight, I'll be right back. She's in 8-B, but the door's locked. Super Buddies to the rescue! Doors aren't a problem for Super Budderball! - I can hear someone whimpering. - Smoke, dissipate. Oh, no! We're trapped! Buddha, move the debris! - I can't move it... - Now what do we do, super dudes? We're superheroes, remember? Let's not panic. I think that train already left the station, dawgs! Captain Canine! Captain Canine, is that really you? You're real! You five puppies have the Rings of Inspiron? You have no idea how long I've been searching for those. These are the real Rings of Inspiron? Not toys? Yes, and lucky for you pups, I tracked them here. We have no time to waste. Grab onto my neck, and don't let go. - Mom! - Oh! There's the girl! The Super Pups and Captain Canine saved me! Whoa, dawgs! That was way too close for comfort. What you did back there was very dangerous. You pups have much to learn before you're ready to handle the power of those Rings. - Now where did you find them? - At my grandpa's farm. Drex will track the signal to the originating position. We must hurry, we are in great danger. There, look! Oh, my! Sofia Ramirez reporting to you live with the real Super Pups! Pups, now. There's very little time. I know it's in here somewhere. - What are we looking for exactly? - The symbol on the spaceship, I'm sure it's here in one of these comics. Dude, these are just comics. They're not real life. See? It's in issue number one. They came out of the smoke with superhero costumes on. Are the five Super Pups descendants of the elusive Captain Canine? Five Super Puppies? But how? The Rings! They have great powers. Oh, my goodness! The Buddies have the real Rings of Inspiron! Our Buddies are superheroes! And that symbol means that the evil Drex might be here in Fernfield! The Buddies could be in trouble! Charge! Oh, this planet and their music. You, there! Yes, I'm talking to you, you idiotic life-form. - Good golly, Molly. - The name's not Molly. It's Commander Drex! And I'm about to snatch your pathetic body. What in tarnation? This can't be! Hmm, hmm. Primitive, hmm, but it'll have to do. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop right there! You are under arrest! This is illegaI changing-of-the-sheriff-into-a-pig! There he is. Hey, Sheriff Dan. Are we ever glad to see you. Yeah, that spaceship was real. It belongs to the evil Drex who came to Earth to capture the Rings of Inspiron! Aren't you a genius? We're pretty sure our Buddies have the Rings and are in grave danger. Hand over those poopies and the Rings, now! Guys? That's not Sheriff Dan... Correct! I am Drex, feared leader of the Darkonian races! So, you sit on this oval-looking thingamajig, and it turns into something called a chick? - You got it. - Yeah, and then you become a mother, - my alien friend. - That's out of this galaxy. - May I try? - Don't sit on it, it'll crack! Well, aren't you being a bit of a mother hen? I don't think so. Help! I'm being held captive in my own jail! Help! Sniffer, it's me, Sheriff Dan! That pig swapped bodies with me! Jiminy Cricket, Sheriff Dan! You're a pig! Oh, boy, Sniffer! It sure is good to hear your voice. Even if I did have to grow a pair of pig ears to do it! Well, shucks. I'm guessing you don't want the double bacon breakfast burrito you had me fetch you. Think I'll be taking a break from bacon. What exactly happened, Sheriff? My body's been taken by an allen! Seems Farmer Marvin isn't crazy after all. Come on, partner, the kids are in trouble. Now we've gotta warn the Buddies. It is time to get ready for the biggest challenge of your lives. Protecting the Rings from Drex is the most important thing you will ever do. Can't you stop him? Without the Rings, I have no superpowers. Uh, you could borrow mine, dawg. Unfortunately, as soon as you found the Rings and they were activated, they became bonded to you. So now, only you Buddies can use the powers to stop Drex. - They seem to work in a mystical way. - There's actually a logic to it. We all have a vibrational field that none of us can see, but all of us can feel. The Rings take your natural skills and abilities and amplifies them many times. It's time I showed you just how powerful they really are. If you have the skill to elude capture, the Rings will allow you to blend into your environment and move through objects, or objects to move through you. Well, looky here. The egg thief is back! Ladies, let's learn 'em there's no picking on us chickens. Chicks normally dig me! Birds of a feather, defend together! - No, wait! Honestly, I'm a vegan! - Let's get him, girls! Yo, what just happened? Camouflage not only saves you, MudBud, but when you focus on others, your invisibility extends to them as well. If you are quick of foot and mind, you will become supersonic. Standard dodgeball rules, if a ball touches you, you're out. If you carry great strength, you will be stronger than a raging bull. Whoa! Strong like puppy! Ol! If you have clarity of thought, you can develop your mind so you can move many objects at once. - Wow, this is cooI! Whoa, we're floating! Better stop, I might throw up all four of my stomachs. - Wow! What just happened? - Very good, Buddha. Remember, positive energy will always win over negative energy. If you are agile, you will become as flexible as rubber. Marco! Polo! Marco! Polo! Don't let your ego take control. Remember, smooth is more important than fast, in your case. Yo, smooth is fast. That's totally my new motto, dawg. - Marco, dawgs! Polo! Drex's big weapon is an electricaI charge. B- Dawg, remember, when your Ring is activated, your body has the metabolic consistency of rubber. Electricity cannot conduct through rubber. So only you can protect your Buddies from a direct hit. Now that you have mastered your individuaI skills, it's very important that each of you stop thinking of yourselves as individuals. In order to defeat Drex, you will have to work together, utilizing all of your superpowers as one force. Our kids! Let's go see them, Buddies. Stay put. That could be Drex. The Darkonians can possess any life-form they choose and use it as their own. They call it "body-snatch. " What a piece of space junk. Sheriff Dan, what are you doing back here? How come those kids are in your cruiser? Bartleby! Gramps! That's not Sheriff Dan, it's an allen. Watch out! That's right, old man. Watch out. Hyah! - Gramps! - Oh, no! Don't worry. He's just stunned. - Into the red structure! - Do what he says. Get! It's locked. But we've gotta find a way to stop him. I don't know if this is the best time to read, dawg. Guys, with all we've seen today, it's pretty obvious that the rumors are true. Everything in the Captain Canine comic books is real. There's gotta be something in here to tell us how to defeat Drex. Start reading. Something tells me that ain't good in the hood, dawgs. Are you sure this is the way to Fernfield Farms, old buddy? Even with four legs, this seems further than I remember it. I'm afraid I got us lost. No offense, Sheriff, but you really stink. So bad that I can't pick up the trail. Do you mind going downwind from me? Oh, sorry, old boy. And I agree, I'm a little ripe. What in the blazes is that? Gotta call Sheriff Dan. That was Sheriff Dan. Breaking news, as a meteor has unexpectedly changed course and is heading straight toward Earth. Scientists report the meteor changed direction and is accelerating at a rapid pace toward us without explanation. They estimate only hours left before its devastating impact. We go now to Sofia Ramirez, reporting live from the field. Thank you, Tom. This just in. A strange electrical storm is also being caused by the meteor as it gets closer to Earth. Stay inside. Keep your loved ones safe. Super Pups, if you're watching, please help us. Huh. Looks like it's up to Grandpa-Man to save the day. Stay behind this tractor. I'll flush out Drex. And remember what I taught you. Drex, it's I, Captain Megasis. Megasis? But your ship! I thought you were dead! You thought wrong. After all these years, I look forward to obliterating you once and for all. Without the Rings, you have no powers to match me. We'll see about that. You missed me. That's all you got? You're through, Drex. Captain Canine! No! Come out wherever you are, you little Super Poopies! I think it's time to surrender. Without your not-so-furless leader, you haven't got a hope! Captain Canine said we will have to combine our powers. Surrender the Rings of Inspiron, and I will consider sparing your lives. - We have to believe in ourselves. - It's time to be a team. It's time to really be the Super Buddies. We will never surrender the Rings to evil like you, Drex. Positive energy will always win over negative energy. Om... Om... Om... This is going to be like taking a bone from a puppy! Oh! - Way to go, Buddha! - Good one, Buddha! - Hyah! Uh-oh. Don't worry, dawgs. Super B-Dawg is in the house. No, you didn't! Electricity can't conduct through rubber. Uh, fine. Try to stop this! I got this one. Now what, dawgs? We can't play defense forever. Nobody bullies my brothers and sis! Now it's my turn to... - Hmm. - Ol! Brave like puppy, strong like bull. - That was awesome, dude! - Way to go, Budderball. That was great! Ol! Viva el puppy! Viva el puppy! Ow! Uh-oh. There you are, you little traitor! Oh, no! Busted! Enough of this puppy play! Om... Om... I can't hold it forever. MudBud, this would be a very good time for us to disappear. Gotcha, bro. Dudes, that did not sound good. The Rings of Inspiron were hidden in a torpedo and sent to Earth. Captain Megasis defeated Drex not by using his superpowers, but by using his intellect. - He tricked him. - So, how are we gonna do that? - Drex wants the Rings, right? - Yeah, so? So, let's just give them to him! Whoa! What was that? Hmm. I know you're in there! It was a valiant effort, dawgs. I have really enjoyed being your brother and the leader of this pack. - Superheroes never give up. - Enough of these silly games! - Prepare... - Give it all you got! ...to be obliterated! Dudes, let's split. Budderball, get in quick! - MudBud, come on! - Come on, Buddha! Follow me, guys! You can't escape me! No! No! Give me the Rings now, or I will blast you. Here they are, Drex. But you have to promise - to leave Earth and all of us alone. - No, Bartleby, don't! - Yeah, don't! - Stop! I don't make promises. I make threats and keep them. That wasn't so hard. Now that I have the Rings of Inspiron, I will rule this galaxy! - Please, just leave us in peace. - With pleasure. Your final hour of peace. You see, I've redirected a meteor to collide with Earth. It's going to hit right here in Fernfield! No! There you are! Stop, in the name of the law! You are under arrest! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of Earthling law. Now, please give me my body back so I can cuff you. If you insist. Take it back. It is a sorry bag of charred bones anyway. - Sheriff, you're back! - My body! I love you, body. Oh, oh. - ... my handcuffs here and... - Good riddance, Earthlings. Stop right there! Hey! I was arresting you! Do not get on that spaceship, mister! What's happening? Those aren't the Rings of Inspiron! Those are plastic! Oh, no! - I think that was the asterold! - Yeah! Gotcha! Yeah! We're bad! Yes! Oh-ho. Finally, I found you all! - Mr. Schaeffer, sir? - Where's Captain Canine? Oh, no. Are you okay, B-Dawg? Allergies, from the chickens. That dude was a totally awesome allen. He was an inspiration to us all. I wanted to be just like him. It was his life's mission to protect the Rings of Inspiron from falling into Drex's evil clutches. Well, he accomplished his mission. You mean Drex didn't get the Rings? Not exactly. I just wish he could have seen this day... And brought the Rings back to his planet. Wait a second. "The Rings of Inspiron apart hold great powers, "but together have the healing powers capable of miracles!" Buddies! Surround Captain Canine's body with the Rings! - Good idea! - Yeah, yeah! Huh? It worked! It worked! Yay! Captain Canine, sir, are you okay? I see you defeated Drex all on your own. I knew you could do it. I'm proud of all of you Buddies. You really are super, with or without the Rings. We did it together, as a team. Just like you taught us, Captain Canine. We just had to believe in ourselves. It is good to see you again, Captain Megasis. And you, too, Kid Courageous. Wait a minute, dawg. You're Kid Courageous? It's all real, isn't it, Mr. Schaeffer? Yeah, it is. You think I could make this stuff up? I can't believe it's all over. And you defeated Drex. How did you do that? We tricked Drex, just like what Captain Megasis did in issue number one. We gave him the Rings from the Puppy Chow. You kids and Buddies proved that the first rule of being a superhero is true. Rule number one... You don't have to have superpowers to be a superhero. Hero. - Whoa! - What is that? - Wow! - Whoa! Look at that! Whoa! Wow. Greetings, Earthlings. I am Princess Jorala of Inspiron. As soon as the Rings were activated, we started tracking them across the galaxy. Hi, I'm Bartleby. Welcome to Earth. On behalf of Inspiron, we thank you for stopping Drex and returning the Rings to the Inspiron people. Bartleby Livingstone, I hear you were the leader of this victory. It was all of us, Your Highness, and especially our Buddies. Please accept this as a token of Inspiron's eternal gratitude. - It has always brought me good fortune. - Thank you. And where is Captain Megasis? I'm here, my princess. I took the form of this dog when I landed on Earth. Captain Megasis, you will be a hero on Inspiron. I have missed you so. With Drex gone, the galaxy is safe again. The Darkonians will return to their peacefuI ways. Buddies, please do the honor and present the Rings of Inspiron to our princess. My princess. Wow. Thank you for saving me. It's been a great pleasure having you as my partner all these years, Jack. I couldn't have made it this far without you, my friend. You were like the father to me that I lost. My princess, it's time for us to go home. Princess Jorala, I always knew that girls could rule the world. And now, after meeting you, I know that we can rule the whole galaxy! Yo, Captain Megasis, if you ever need a charismatic wingdog, I'm your Buddy. Catch you later, alien brochacho. Excuse me, Your Highness. I am Monk-E, Commander Drex's former lieutenant. I would welcome the opportunity to be at your humble service. I can see you have a pure heart. Welcome aboard, Monk-E. I've always dreamed of going to the planet Inspiron! - Until we meet again, Buddies. - Thank you, Captain Megasis. - Goodbye, Earthlings. Bye! - It was nice meeting you! - Fare-thee-well. Goodbye! As much as I miss Captain Canine, when one door closes, another one opens. So without further ado, let me proudly present my partner in our new comic book series, Super Buddies, a very talented young man, Mr. Bartleby Livingstone. - Yeah! Go, Bartleby! - Good job! "Captain Megasis and Princess Jorala returned to the planet of Inspiron, "which glows brighter than ever before. "And the Super Buddies picked up where they left off. "As one adventure ended, a new one was about to begin. " Brave like puppy, strong like bull. Now I'm super-duper pooper-scooper-fly, yo! Nope. Right on time. It's like I'm so fast that everything is so last season by the time it gets to me. That is a mega-colossal bummer. We can protect our humans from those with bad karma. Jiminy Cricket, Sheriff Dan! You're a pig! I am-ay outta-ay ere-hay ude-day. Imagine what I could do to a matador! Ol! Ladies, let's learn 'em there's no picking on us chickens. We're cows. Our minds are always empty, Buddha. Fantastic! It just screams girl power. We gotta neigh it out loud and proud, girlfriend. - Greetings, human. - And so our adventure begins! That's out of this galaxy. May I try? Oh, thank goodness. Not that I was scared or anything. Mmm, tasty. What in tarnation? This can't be! Oh, I'll give you some cattitude. You ain't seen nothing, dog friends. Greetings, Earthlings. I am Princess Jorala of Inspiron.
