You should be. I'm the guy who arranged your transfers. Just like you I've been transferred,... banished from Division Headquarters Personnel Dept. to the front line. How about it? Coming with me? Silence means you've agreed. Let's get along. Run for it! What happened to your guns? I told you to pick them up from the weapons dept. We don't know how to fire a gun. We've just graduated from music school. Our only weapon is our musical instrument. I see... But playing your instruments might draw the enemy. This area is a guerilla hot spot. That was hit just yesterday. What a sorry bunch I'm with. Let's go! A tank! You got lousy ears for musicians. It's not a tank. It's one of our trucks. We'll get a lift. I'll stop the truck. Everyone jump in when it stops. What? It's Oharu. "What?" That's no way to greet me. Then... Why? I've been transferred. Transferred, where? I'm going to the same place as you, Kosugi-san. It's cold. Let's get going. Um... we're still wet. You'll dry off while walking. Let's go. We want to go but can't stand up. Huh? Can't stand? Well... It's standing but... Young ones. You guys are young. Go back in the river once more and cool off. Forward crawl. What's the matter, Kosugi-san? They all had a spot they forgot to wash, so I sent them back in. Go easy on them. They're still kids. That lady was saying... The sergeant is an important officer who won a distinguished service medal. If he's so important why was he let go from headquarters? I think it goes like this: It involves the woman. She's in love with the sergeant. And the commander is in love with her. "No! No!" she said, running away. "How about it?" said the commander while chasing her. Then the sergeant came barreling in. Hey! We're in Feijiazhai. You're digging a pretty deep hole. Yes. Wolves come around here. Oh? You're digging very carefully. Five years in the battlefield and this is all I've been doing. I'm still a private first class. I'm Private Mochida. But everyone calls me the Mortician. I was a mortician in Tokyo until I was drafted. This is about the only thing a mortician can do. The least I can do is allow them a peaceful rest after burial. Who died? No. It's for one who is about to die. How sad. Badly injured. There's an Apprentice Officer Obara in this regiment, right? Yes. What was that... guerilla fire? No. That was Officer Obara. What? Listen. From now on you guys have nothing to do with me. This is important. You must remember. He's started again. He's really sick. Sick? Sick, I say. You'll be dead if you don't shape up. Stack arms! Excellent. One shot to forehead center. Who shot him? I did. What about it? You are a murderer. A murderer? You're kidding me. Everyone fired, you know. Only one shot hit him. So? Well? So What!? Your first shooting death? Yeah. I haven't held a rifle in a while. I'm embarrassed to say in 7 years of service I've only held a knife as a cook. I was a chef when I lived in the countryside. If you think you'll make me cook... I see. Sorry. I apologize. Hey. I shot him squarely so he could rest peacefully. What's wrong with that? Not wrong, but you don't have to be the only murderer here. No one knows who actually hit him. It's because everyone has one eye closed. That's death by shooting. What happens when everyone misses? By order one guy fires. The killer is just that one guy. I see... Argh! Wait! I will take care of him. So you guys made me the only shooter! You won't take all the credit while I get blamed. This time... I'll really make you thankful to this 7-year soldier. Only rice and water for you guys tonight! Poor thing. He's the same age as you guys. Hey. We meet again. With her, as usual? Where's Commander Sakuma? Reporting. No need to report. I know all about you. Then I will ask you a question. I also know about it. "Why did you execute Apprentice Officer Obara?" Desertion in the presence of the enemy. Apprentice Officer Obara was in command of Fort Yakiba. Also known as Fort Y.K. The entire Yakiba garrison was killed in action with the exception of Obara. Rather than face enemy attack... Obara withdrew from the battlefield. Our troops spotted him wandering near the patrol border and arrested him. Do you have proof whether he withdrew before or after the garrison was annihilated? No. Huh? No, there's no other way to see it. You question me for such a trivial matter. You then become violent. Again you strike a superior officer. While stationed at Headquarters... You avoided court-martial due to your outstanding achievements, but you won't avoid it a second time. Furthermore, my body is elegantly built. One blow by you would destroy it. Understood. However, Apprentice Officer Obara was killed in action. He should be promoted to First Lieutenant. A non-combat death. I intend to record a non-combat death for Second Lieutenant Obara. Why so concerned? Do you know him? No. But... I feel sorry for you. Oh? That's a nice thing to say. Why? Because your body is elegantly built. Kosugi. Let go of him. But... It's okay. Police! Arrest Kosugi for striking a superior officer. Yes, sir. Oh, those boys? The reason you got violent at Headquarters was that... you opposed sending them to the front, then you chomped on the Deputy Officer. Hmm... What's going on over there? That is the military band. I'm talking about that song. It's probably a memorial song for Apprentice Officer Obara. "Out to Sea" should be the memorial song. "Out to Sea" is too sad. Obara was around 22 or 23. His life was cut too short. Too pitiful. At least send him off with a lively song. Don't you think so? Not my feeling. I hear it as an affront to career servicemen and as a resistance to military organization. Commander Sakuma here. Giving command. Salute! Eyes right. Eyes front! Reporting. 2nd class Private Harada, Military Band Unit. 13 members. We have come to perform for your troops. Thanks. Thanks, but my unit rejects your offer. Huh? By command from Headquarters... You will now be treated as ordinary soldiers. The reason. The War Cabinet sees music as unnecessary to fighting a war. Leave your instruments here. Practice war songs on the premise until further command. But... just don't go to Yasukuni Shrine. You'll be treated badly by the other gods. It's good you're going out first class. Even demons disappear. You do so, too. You listen to this mortician's words. I've been a mortician for 25 years, you know. Full of mercy, rightly take the sword. Zoo-san. We're not open yet. I thought you were already open for business. A new woman came today? I already gave her a key. You have a good nose for business. Don't know if it's my nose or where else. Where is she? Room Yoshiwara? Room Tamadon? Room Shinjuku 2-chome. Hey. So you were here. It's Netsu-san. Your love for Kosugi even brought you all the way to the front line. The closer I get to the front line, the higher my price. That's not the only reason. Kosugi's really got a hold of you. Yeah. I'm his warhorse. Where Kosugi-san goes to battle, I go too. I feel sorry for him. Kosugi-san... again? Yeah. He'll be up for court-martial tomorrow. It's serious this time too? Very serious. He can't avoid it. How about it, Oharu. Time for the horse to change riders, you think? Kosugi and I are basically the same. We entered the military the same time, have the same rank. And you... could cause 5 or 6 men to cry in one evening. Maybe they cried for their own reasons. What's going on with her. ...that's what they're saying. Those old battle-worn hags cried while saying that. I thought it had an impact on me. Oharu. What's the difference between Kosugi and me. A great big difference. The most inept man and the coolest man. Kosugi-san has fought 24 times. He always stares death in the face. You are conceited and always take the easy way out. Here's the difference. No. It's here. Rude and arrogant ones will not ascend to Heaven. Pressing onward. Training sincerely. The man who was executed never once came here. That's what everyone said. Can't say he's a man. Poor thing. He died without knowing what's good. I wish I could've showed him. What? No side dishes? Don't be picky. Back home you were eating fish and potato leaves. We're on the battlefield now. Why don't you have even a single dish? What I don't have I don't cook. That's how a first-rate chef operates. I see. Then what's this? That's for the higher-ups to eat. The commander? Don't touch! Why'd you do that? Shut up! Go to hell! Length of service is what counts in the military,... not your rank. I have 7 years of experience. I'm a veteran. Got complaints? Then take it up with me. I'm ready. Sergeant. A little something. Juicy, tender, and charcoal-broiled. Thanks. Go ahead and eat. It's a hen. A female? Right. Looks like a schoolgirl virgin. You can't fool me with that. Fool you? You're military police sent by the commander. He thinks we're trying to coax him. Why would we coax a lowlife like you? Relax and eat it. You don't have to eat it if you don't want to. You lousy beggar! What did this guy do to get sent here? This guy... He's a big guy, but a great coward. What could you understand? Want to play rough! Go ahead. Hit me! I'm against violence. What did he do? He didn't do anything and got sent to the brig. He said he didn't like shooting a rifle. Oh? He's pretty dirty. Been here long? Almost 2 years. Leaving Yoshino, heading home on the mountain wind. Clouds and flags flutter. The enemy's voice echoes. Harada, let's stop. I'm beat. Let's sleep. Can we? It doesn't matter. The commander won't know. He forgot about us. Without taking his head. Cheer up. Live to go home again. Prepare for death. The weak enemy will crumble. Private Mochida. I'm here to return the pick and shovel. I'm here... It's looking dangerous. Take aim at the enemy's weakness. Thoughts of taking the enemy's head. Pressing onward Though our allies are few. A new enemy surrounds us from afar. The MP sergeant is in the brothel. The MP corporal is snoring loudly. Now is the time if you wish to run away. Sergeant! Sergeant! Now is the best time. Sergeant. Don't dilly dally. Quickly. Hurry. It's useless doing this if the commander has forgotten about us. We have to sing at his bedside. Right. Right. Harada! Praise and speak to the man. Stop the singing. The MP sergeant is in the brothel. The MP corporal is snoring loudly. Quickly run away. You won't get caught. You won't get caught... Get in. Begin military song. When does it end? Rain falling on helmets and crying continue endlessly. Private Mochida was arrested for the crime of aiding a deserter. I request help with Kosugi, Inuyama, and Mochida's court-martial tomorrow. Quiet! Huh? Not you. The boyscouts outside. Get them to sleep. Yes. Hurry up. Already gone are the cigarettes. The matches too... You go on home, too. I won't. I haven't finished. I know what you're thinking. You'll plead for Kosugi's life while telling me a lullaby. You're smart, Commander. Shall we start after we're finished talking? Hey! Wait. Stop it! Stop singing. Shut up. Don't be a fool. Stop it, fool. Commander, are you trying to make a fool out of me? You shouldn't make fun of women working the sake of the country. Umm... Well, that's not it. You have the wrong idea. I'm not the type of man who gets involved in that sort of thing. Then you'll cancel Kosugi-san's court-martial? I can't promise you that. Fine. Alright. Alright. Leave Kosugi to me. Hurry. Put on your kimono and go home. Now I get it. Get what? Commander, you're a virgin. Vir... Don't get out of line! Fall in line. Forward. Order. Sergeant Kosugi will command one squad, attack Fort Yakiba... and capture it. Commander. What about their court-martial? Huh? Speak clearly. I can't hear with this rain. The court-martial. I can't hear a thing. I'm still giving orders. Stop grumbling. Sergeant Kosugi, repeat. I, Sergeant Kosugi, will command the attack on Fort Yakiba. Next. Private Inuyama and Mochida will remain in confinement until further orders. You said something? Repeat. No need to repeat. Where's the military band? It was so sudden that they went to... the brothel. Huh? The boyscouts are at the brothel? You boys slept well last night? You're growing a beard. Looks like it. I'll kiss you. That's alright. Alright? You mean yes or no? I mean no. You're cute. His legs are trembling. I'm soaked. Be careful. No need to salute. Giving command. Private Harada and 13 soldiers are hereby under the command of Sergeant Kosugi... and will join in the attack on Fort Yakiba. After the attack, the Kosugi unit will hold the fort and patrol surrounding area until further command. Selection of weapons will be left to Sergeant Kosugi. Depart the day after tomorrow in the morning. During this time the military band will be treated as ordinary soldiers. Training will be left up to Sergeant Kosugi. Dismissed. I offer my opinion. Listening. The band members are not battle-trained. Don't you think sending them to Yakiba is like sending them to their death? I wonder. In your hands you'll show them a way to survive. I don't want them to die. Fort Yakiba is the battalions... no, the military's eyes and ears. Without eyes and ears we can't know the enemy's movements. This month alone we suffered But... I know. Being stuck with band members is difficult for you. Am I mistaken? I would use that difficulty to my advantage. I'd use it to capture Fort Yakiba. For you to overcome this difficulty... You must fervently teach them how to survive. Either kill or be killed on the battlefield. Survival means winning. No matter how valiant or elite the soldier, it amounts to nothing if he dies. Survival of your group means... the success of the eyes and ears of the military. Hey! Don't plunge the rifle! Your rear is too high! How will you take a crap if it gets shot! I mean you. Huh? What instrument do you play? The clarinet. Fine. Clarinet Battle Death. Yes. Listen carefully to the machine gun fire. I got it! At 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4, we run! Correct. Keep tempo by yourself while running. Our goal is the machine gun at the fortress left gate. Forward. Hey Clarinet! Wake up. I died in battle. Fool. You were reborn. Yes. Get going. We'll all be dead if we don't take out that machine gun. Kill first! Attack quickly. Trumpet, go ahead. Trumpet death there! What're you guys doing? Your comrade was killed before your eyes. Get revenge. Attack the enemy. Charge! Fine. Completed. Next. Covert operations! Silently this time. Make a noise and you'll be killed. Springtime. It's March. The snow melts. If the flower... blooms. What was that? The next village... Wait there, doggy, please. What's going on! You'll regret messing with the military police! That's enough. Well done, mostly. Sneaking up on the enemy is necessary to capture his weapon and lead to victory. So written in the Strategic Operations Manual. I'll arrest all of you for violence! Silence! Take your complaints to the commander. I have permission to train using any methods necessary. Harada. Yes. Private Harada will command a separate unit and crawl toward the open area. The goal is to get to your musical instruments that were thrown away. Repeat necessary? No. Fall in. Yippee! Forward crawl. Sweet bunch. I don't want them killed. Kosugi. Hurry up and untie me if you're done practicing. That reminds me. You should know. Know what? The conditions when the Yakiba garrison was annihilated. That apprentice officer said that... his entire group was killed in action and communications equipment broke down. That is why he returned to make contact. But... What? That was a lie. How could you tell it was a lie? Wasn't he forced to lie by torture? No. He was lying. The apprentice officer's finger showed evidence of torture. I heard a rumor to that effect. You heard that from the mortician? Hmmm. Anyhow, I will thoroughly check into the apprentice officer's situation. I'm the one who investigated, but Commander Sakuma ordered the execution. I'll remember that. Russia invaded Manchuria 2 or 3 days ago. The Kanto forces suffered terribly. You should worry about yourself instead of others. You're concerned after all... that the execution itself was a mistake. No. There was no mistake. The commanding officer, even if alone for whatever reason, must fight. I made the right choice. That's what I believe. Can't you change his status from execution to killed in action? You still haven't written a report on Obara's death. You have doubts about the military police investigation. Is that why? If you succeed in capturing Fort Yakiba... you will search for the truth of the garrison's wipe out? Of course. I will wait to write the report. I'd like 3 men besides the band members for the attack. Alright. Choose ones you can rely on. Well then, I ask for the 3 men in the brig. Fine. Show me glory in death. Death is not certain. Of course. I truly hope you can survive. You will be a great soldier if you survive. Their last performance. Please let them bid farewell to their instruments. Great! You said this was their final performance. Yes. I don't think they need approval to carry their instruments. As long as it doesn't hinder our battle plan. Why are you crying? I feel the music deep inside of me. And I'll be separated from you. You should return home. Go to the safest place possible while you can. No. I'll save more money to reach my target. Will this be enough? Certainly. I should return some change. But I can't accept money from you. I've never received money from you. You just hold on to it. If you hear news of my death, accept the money. Fool! You mustnt die. I won't die. I have countless things to do. You sure do. You must live. Really. No. March. Stop march. Wherever you go, ask the commander directly to accommodate you. But he's cold-hearted. I don't think so. I misjudged him. He's poorly suited to being a career soldier. Poorly suited... It's better than seeing them court-martialed. You're wrong. I bet on the dark horse. That's all. Deputy Officer, form a 2nd attack unit. Huh? We must capture Fort Yakiba. For just one fort, we'll be killing or dying. Nothing's so stupid. Run away by yourself if you don't want to go. I'll look the other way. Can you kill a person? I can't. But if I'm about to be killed, I guess I'll have to kill. Kill with all my might... probably. Ma. Yes. Sergeant, I feel an enemy attack coming whenever I get an athlete's foot itch. That's useful to know. I feel as though someone is watching us. It's embarrassing. Stop. Only a farmer. He's no farmer. Nothing grows in this dirt. Should we shoot him? Let's wait and see if he's alone or in a group. We'll know soon enough. Let's go. Don't let the kids notice. It won't work if they notice. Okay. Captain. The enemy. Hit the dirt. Run away. Fool. Come back. You idiot. Return. Why. Why did you run away? You said to run away. Fool. I said to hit the dirt. Mochida. Mortician. Yes. How strong is the enemy? Hmm... about 1 platoon. Yes. We're completely surrounded. What should we do? Stay put. The enemy are 2 to 3 guerillas at most. Follow them? No. We can have a festival with just these. It's the first time I've seen such weak Japanese soldiers. Well then, I'm glad. They'll run away in due time. It's trouble if they run away. They'll report us to Yakiba. My drums! My trumpet! You guys ran away empty-handed? You left the drums and sticks! They left their weapons, too. You guys aren't here on a school excursion. Go and get them. Let's go. Stop. Stop! Listen to me! You'll get injured! The captains. The sergeant wasn't hit? He'll be alright. We'll be surrounded by the enemy. An enemy of 3 with 1 dead. How do you know? Oharu. Pulling out? No. I'm just preparing so I can leave at any time. Want something? I thought you might be lonely. I'm fine. I'm fine. I wonder if Kosugi-san's unit is okay. You haven't heard anything? They're hopeless with those amateurs. Fort Yakiba. Also known as Fort Y.K. Details as follows. The fort is surrounded by a circular moat having a 5 meter width and 2 meter depth. Connection with the outer area is only through one drawbridge. A bin-shaped 3-level bunker stands in the center of the fort. Firing is possible from each level. The top floor is the communications room, also used as a lookout. A cookhouse and an outhouse lay to the north. To the east a barracks is located near the bridge. A guardhouse stands next to the bridge. A well in the center of the huts is used for drinking water. The preceding is based on the report by the Yakiba garrison and Apprentice Officer Obara. How does it look? Not good. All I can see are 1 sentinel and 1 lookout. Can't see any soldiers. What happened to the boys? I wanted them to relax so I sent them all to take a crap. Huh? You see robbers do it before they act. They're out by the tall grass. Fools! I didn't tell them to fart too. Looks around 50. But we're mostly amateurs. Not a normal group. Wait until nightfall? If our amateurs attack at night, they'll just end up shooting each other. Hold on. Chief Cook! Eh? How many times would you carry those buckets in order to feed 50 men? I'd carry it about 3 times. Which means 2 more times. Listen to me. Look carefully while taking a deep breath. Good. Any of you guys played baseball? Yes. I did. You? Was your control good? Of course. I pitched in the Koshien National Tournament. I was the ace and batted 4th. You made it to the semifinals? No. Only the first round. My control was too good and got knocked around. Great. Carry these hand grenades and follow me. Huh? Scared? Yes. Even I am scared. I'll go, Sergeant. You fire the machine gun. You and Trombone will aim your machine guns at... the open area and shoot the enemy when they come out. Alto Sax and Clarinet will carry the ammunition. Big and Little Drum will also aim grenade launchers at the open area. And I carry ammunition? We already have enough carriers. You're in command of the remaining group. You will attack. Piccolo, Sousaphone, and Trumpet will bayonet thrust. We really can't thrust. You'll do fine. If all goes well there won't be any enemies to thrust at. Oh? What if we don't succeed? You can't fight a battle thinking you're going to fail. True. Shiga! Yes. You remain here and look after the prisoner of war. Sergeant, the water carriers left the kitchen a 3rd time. Ready! 1st point. Do not forget your rhythm. You'll be killed if your rhythm goes haywire. Kill before getting killed if you want to live! The water carriers started to cross the bridge. He's taking a pee on top of the bridge. And another one. I guess all nationalities like taking a group pee. You guys start moving when the barracks blows up. If we're killed before we can blow it up, then run away. If you see the Japanese flag raised on top of the bunker, gather at the fort's open space. Go for it, everyone! Ace. The game begins. Your mound is that shadow from the house. When I give you the sign, throw a strike at one of them. Do your best. You do it too. You'll calm down. I just did it. You already peed? No, but we've transformed into coolies. Never mind. Just do it. Not a drop comes out. Me too. Ace, throw the grenade. Hurry up. Fool. Count to 3 before throwing. Okay. There it is. My machine gun is broken. Release the safety pin. You fool. It works now. Of course, you fool. Big Drum. Little Drum. Get with it. Look out. Everyone scramble! A bomb is coming down. Of course. This is war. Forward! Good. Throw to the outfield next. Left. Center. Right. Ready. The bunker is next. Follow me. Trombone, follow me. What should we do? Everyone has left. Follow me, everyone. Only one grenade left. Take a good look and throw. Where's our machine gunners? What's going on, Clarinet! Stop crying. I don't have any bullets. Trombone got killed. I must avenge... but no bullets. Stop crying, idiot. Sax! Bring some bullets. Go now? Maybe it's too early. But they have reached the bunker, right? Let's go. Fool. It's still early. Retreat. Listen to me. Hey. Listen to me. I hit him! Let's go. Wait. It's Sergeant. I'm antsy... and impatient. Cover me. Amateurs! Killers! Inuyama, You okay? That was a close one. You climb to the rooftop and wave this. I'll check on Harada. Looks like he was hit. Harada? Attack! Charge! Thrust! Fools. You idiots. Huh? Why are you doing this now? The battle's over. What absurdity. All this killing. Private Harada. Killed. Any others killed? Trombone is dead. What's everyone doing? A funeral for Pitcher and Trombone. Tell them to wait until evening. The enemy may still be lurking nearby. (Chinese) Stop the funeral. Can't you understand? But we should give them a proper burial. Look out. Mortar fire! Scramble! Jump in the trenches! Run for it. Wow. A precise hit. Everyone okay? Okay. I will explain what's happening. The enemy has a mortar site nearby. I estimate 5 or 6 mortars and an observation soldier. Where are they? They're watching us from somewhere. Everyone be careful. We don't know when a bomb will come flying towards us. Chief, let me kill them. Wait. Rather than kill them, we could use them to our advantage. Hey, Mochida. Yes? You said you could easily handle 100 or 200 corpses. Eh? I guess so... The Chinese army treats the deceased with respect. Our defeated garrison should be buried around here somewhere. Right. In return we should give their soldiers a proper burial. No. You needn't bury them. That's cruel. You'll carry them to the encampment. It would be advantageous to have the Chinese bury them. From my experiences they always come to take them away. There's our chance. We don't shoot. We let them carry the bodies away. You're kidding. The guys who pick up the bodies will be the same ones who fired the mortars. They'll certainly come this evening. While they're out we'll go and crush them. You're wise after all. Now you're talking. Go on, Mochida. By myself? Yeah. Try carrying one body as a test. They won't shoot if they have a heart. What if they're heartless? He'll be alright. I need to fix the radio so I can contact the main unit. I'm no good at machinery. Now I remember. What. Shiga specializes in communications. How's it going? This fort is in a valley. It isn't easy to make contact. I know how. Oh? Telephone. The telephone wire. We'll string out the wire to make contact. I once saw a large-scale migration of vipers in the mountains. That's exactly like it. On their way back they look like snails in great migration. No. They're amoebas I've seen through a microscope. The amoebas gobbled other amoebas then returned. They... They've come again. Ah, the captains. Huh? It's over with. Take it easy, guys. Time to redo the funeral. We'll have a great one. Huh? I don't want a sad one like the last time. Play your Dixie tunes with a splash. Pitcher was 19. Trombone was 18. They didn't even live 20 years. A sad song is too lonely. We must send them off cheerfully to put their souls to rest. Let's liven things up. Start a campfire. Commander! All enemy troops at the fort have gathered together. Same distance and direction. Commence firing. Wow. This is better than the fireworks in Tokyo. What's happening over there? Oh, that? Big Drum, Little Drum. Yes? What happens when you insert 2 shells into a mortar and then shoot? You'll blow yourself up. Bam! Right. Inuyama and I inserted one shell into each of their mortars when they weren't looking. They were certain to insert one more shell when firing. That was the result. You're playing it all wrong. Play it like this. Captain. Yeah? I was able to contact the main unit. You did? Fort attack success. Await ammunition and provisions. Netsu-san, which truck do I ride? This one. It goes to Division Headquarters. And that one? That carries ammunition and provisions to Yakiba. Yakiba. I'm really glad for Kosugi-san. You must go? It's no use staying when Kosugi-san isn't here. Thank you, Commander, for all your help. How regretful. What is? I couldn't end your virginity. Virgin? See you. Sergeant, isn't Oharu here yet? We want to get moving. Huh? Oharu! After that truck! Wait. Ammunition, provisions loaded. Now I can show Sergeant my cutlery skills. Wait. There's more. Oh? Escaped. Kosugi is to arrest her. Hold until further command. He calls for his woman way out here. That sneaky Sergeant. Sergeant. I'm disappointed in you. Calling a woman here. I finally found the graves. Those Chinese really did bury them. Graves? The graves of the garrison that was annihilated. It's strange. What is? Only 10 here. Oh? I'm sure the garrison before comprised 2 squads. If so, Apprentice Officer Obara's report of the wipe out would be a lie. Stop it. This talk is making me ill. You're right. Hey, Inuyama. Seems that Oharu's coming here. She needs a place to sleep. She could sleep with you. That won't do. Then, someplace with a roof. How about the cook's building. The kitchen? Mine? No. No. I won't allow it. Oharu-san Oha-ru-san Oharu-san Oharu-san Oharu-san Oharu-san O H A R U S A N Oharu-san Oha-ru-san Oha-ru-san Oha-ru-san Oharu-san Oharu-san O H A R U S A N Sorry but I've already been with a woman. It's the same no matter how many times you do it. I wonder. Just like the swordsman Benkei. That's why Benkei only did it once in his entire lifetime. I've heard Benkei's story many times. It's all mysterious to me. Like a really good thing, or a really scary thing. A really boring thing. Hey. The truck is here. Lower the bridge. I'll send the POW back in that truck. Strange. The glass on the driver's side is broken. Hold it! Hit the dirt! Get away. Move! Hey, Flute! You were a true soldier after all. Both of them were drivers from the main unit. They're dead. Oharu-san? Oharu-san! Oharu-san? The POW. Damn. Get out. Why you! Stop it. Stop it. What will you gain by killing him? He was blowing Tsuboi's flute. Tsuboi was killed by one of this guy's comrades. You want to kill him? I taught you how to fight a war. But I didn't teach you to murder. Tempting... Oharu-san? Here... Yakiba? Sure is! I'm glad. Kosugi-san! Kosugi-san! I introduce Kaneyama Haruko, known as Oharu-san. I feel like a schoolteacher just transferred here. How embarrassing. I guess that makes me the school principal. Oharu has come way out here in the mountains to comfort you guys. It was no small feat for her... to come out here. I think you all can well appreciate this. When doing it with her, first show respect and thank her, please. Take me, please. Adults go later. Oh? Young men, I think you haven't cleared it yet. I wonder. What do you mean? You know... your virginity. Virgins, raise your hands. You too, Mochida? Everyone raised their hands, so I did too. What... What's this about? You idiot. Lower your hands. You needn't be scared. It's easier than an appendix removal. Right, Oharu? Everyone, do it as though you were sucking on your mother's breast. Umm... What. My mother is, umm... 74 years old. Get ahold of yourself. You were 14 then. Hey, Sousaphone. Yes. Still here? Yes. I still haven't asked yet. Asked? Alright. I'll take your place. Go on. I'm going now. Do your best! Don't say a word. I can't understand Chinese anyway. But I do know this. You like playing this flute. The owner also liked to play it. Therefore... Though dead, he'll be happy. Take this, no questions asked. How was it, Trumpet? Good? Bad? Which was it? Don't kid me, you fool. That was a good idea the captain had. You risk your life fighting under the insignia of the red flag. Our insignia is a military flag, but our young troops have never seen it. That is why the captain made a flag out of red loincloth for them. The youngsters will fight their utmost to protect Oharu, and they'll grow stronger. Growing stronger means staying alive. Even though it's the same red flag... Our side doesn't feel so thankful for it. They're late. I'll never get my turn at this rate. Hey, Sax! Hurry up! You're the slowest one! Get out already. What's the matter, Little Drum... thinking of your mother? No, thinking of Big Drum. He always said that he's the only one who's had a woman. A lie? Yes. It wasn't true. He lied to make everyone happy. He put on an act. He died without knowing how it felt. Enemy attack! Enemy attack! Oharu-san. We're all going to protect you. Huh? That mortician. Enemy attack! Enemy attack! Enemy in the creek behind the cookhouse. About 20. That won't do. That trick won't work a second time. Hurry up. In your positions everyone! Caution ahead! Follow me. Alright. That's enough. Bastards. Inuyama. Huh? What do you think of this bridge? That? I've seen it somewhere before. It's Japanese-made. That means Japanese are among the enemy. Yeah. Never mind that. The enemy will come again. They are sure to return by daybreak. They'll come back. Come to think of it, my athlete's foot is getting really itchy. Get everyone into the bunker. Clarinet. Here. Trumpet. Here. Horn. Here. Tuba. Here. Sousaphone. Here. Piccolo. Here. Little Drum. Here. Tenor Sax. Here. Alto Sax. Here. How's your injury. It's fine. Good. A performance would be no problem with 9 of you. Yes. Good. The rhythm section is a little weak? No problem. I can do both the big and little drums. But Captain... Huh? Why do you know so much about music? Me? When I was your age I loved small street bands. If only once I wanted to wave the conductor's baton. Oh, the mortician's not here. Where's Mochida? He's carrying the enemy over the bridge. Huh? That fool. Come back, Mochida! The enemy's coming! Hurry up and get over here. Hurry and get to the bunker. Listen. When they draw in really close, you fire. You look terrible, Sergeant. What's the matter? It must be my age. I get short of breath when I run. I will contact Headquarters. You take charge. Yes. Ready. Fire. I can't see. I can't see. Hang in there. My eyes. I can't see. Get ahold of yourself. Don't cry. Two left. One left. Keep going. A little more. It's almost daybreak! Hang on. You okay? Alright. Stop shooting. Resting like babies. Never mind, rest up. Keep watch. I'm going to see the sergeant. Captain. We did well. Sergeant! Sergeant! Anyone die? No one. I'm glad. Damn. Oharu. Sergeant's been hit! Kosugi-san. Wear this. Your service medal? It looks better on you. Thanks, really. Kosugi-san. No. You mustn't die! No! Wait. She said to let her do it herself. No need for the mortician. Now, the radio is broken. We can't contact the main unit. Ammunition is almost gone. Only a bit of food left. I'd like someone to go to make contact. Oharu-san, Sergeant is dead. Can you return to the main unit? Now's your chance. I know. We can't withstand another attack. The injured Trumpet and Clarinet are going back to make contact. Return with them. Oharu-san. Oharu-san. Jin-san, you mustn't carry a weapon anymore. You'll go back to the countryside and carry a hoe, right? Let's hold out until evening. If all goes well and they reach the main unit, a support unit will be here by nightfall. Quickly! Sakuma Unit. Prepare to retreat. Out. Each of you can kill 7 men. Can you see everyone? Little Drum. and Sousaphone. Horn. Alto. Tenor. Tuba. Piccolo. I can see everyone. Isn't the melody weak? A little weak. No power. No punch. Let's go back? Let's go back! Clarinet and Trumpet are back. Huh? Those bastards. Hey, Tuba. Lower the drawbridge. Yes. Why'd you guys come back? You'd have a lousy band without us. First of all, there's no "harmo." Hey, Sax. What did Trumpet say just now? Harmo something or other. He said there's no harmony. Huh? It's difficult to explain simply. Difficult? Now isn't the time to worry about harmony. They're worried about harmony, not about dying. Squad number 2. Front. Attention. Proceed. Squad number 3. Front. Attention. Proceed. Squad number 4. Front. Proceed. Sakuma Unit. Begin retreat. Now heading toward main unit. Commander. I won't go back. My men are waiting at Yakiba. I now leave you in charge. But! Sergeant Kosugi had this to say. The commander leads in front when advancing. He holds the rear when retreating. How's the harmony? Oharu-san. There's one more thing I can't understand. It really bothers me. Can you tell me if you know? What is it? Why was the sergeant so concerned about the previous garrison? The apprentice officer who was executed was the sergeant's younger brother. Oh? His brother was adopted by a family. He told me to keep quiet. I guess it's okay now to talk. He thought I'd suffer over this. You shouldn't have kept quiet, Sergeant. It's no joke. Fool! Sergeant, you fool! Into the trenches! Still in harmony? Keep on playing. I'll go and crush that artillery. It's you guys... Sugiyama, Inamoto, Deguchi. Apprentice Officer Obara died covering up your desertion. He died for you guys. No grub for you guys! Oh no! I can't blow it! I can't blow it! Ma. Hey! Hey! Japanese soldiers! Hey! Japanese soldiers! To all Japanese soldiers. The war is over. Kosugi-san. Everyone is dead. Why'd they have to die? On that day, August 15th The End
