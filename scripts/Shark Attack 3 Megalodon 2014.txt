Pressure levels holding steady at seven-niner-zero, p.s.i. That's what I wanted to hear. Okay, guys. Conditions are green. We're go on regulator assembly. Roger that, Topside. We'll snap her together nice and quick. Commence additional stage hookup. Retention 20%. Ease her up gently, fellas. Make sure the manifold seal is nice and tight. Integrity looks solid. Checking for stress points. Increasing tension by 3.5. - We're four hours behind! - Don't worry. We'll make up the lost time. Isn't Boarder done with that cable patch yet? He's still working on it. Keep in mind, it took six hours just to compress him for that depth. And another two to get him on site. See if we can't get him to pick up the pace. What's his current position? 1,540 feet down, and 100 yards from the edge of the trench. That's a five-mile drop-off. So remind him not to do any sightseeing. Deep Calm, this is Bountress, over. Deep Calm? Dave Porter, are you down there? Copy, Bountress. How's it going? How do you think? I'm freezing my nuts off. The super wants me to remind you that you're not getting paid by the hour. Tell him he's welcome to come down and give me a hand. I'll let him know. Slap on that Band-Aid as quick as you can. Bountress, over. What the--? I've got a contact. Down that deep? Impossible. Shouldn't be anything big enough to register. Something is there, 200 yards southeast of Porter's position and closing. - Get him back on the horn. - Porter, this is Bountress. Come in. - Repeat, this is Bountress. - 100 yards. - 75! - Porter, come in! Porter, where the hell are you? - Go ahead, Bountress. - You've got an unknown - approaching from southeast. - Bountress, you're breaking up. Something's coming right at you! - Say again. - 30 yards! - 20. - Get him out of there! Look, damn it! He's right beside you! ( screaming ) Porter. Porter. Porter! Porter. Come in, Porter. This is Bountress. Can you read us? ( grunting ) Woman: Here, Ben Baby. - Your usual. - Hasta maana. - Hey, qu pasa? - Qu pasa, man? - Who's your latest victim? - This one's from Frisco. - I want to treat her extra special. - Hey. Here he goes! - Here comes El Guapo! - Whew! - Good morning, Hector. - Buenos das, Ben. - Brought me coffee? - Caf solo. Will you get that death-trap flying anytime soon? Ben: I'll leave you guys alone. - Try not to kill each other. - El pendejo? Yeah. Rise and shine! Hey, you're the one who's late. If you didn't stop for every chica, you'd be on time. Yeah. - Your usual. - And here's yours. Ben: Sy, is this a great life or what? - Sy: Mi vida loca, amigo. - Luis pays us to patrol the beach. Some guy at the harbor told me about this dive spot - that's crawling with lobsters. - Sounds good. It's south of Banderas Point. Oh no. That's way out of our patrol zone. You'll get us in trouble, again. - Don't worry about it. - Again. I said, don't worry about it. We'll do it after our shift. No one's going to find out. - Trust me. - Trust you? Why do I let you talk me into things like this? 'Cause you're my bitch. - You wish. - ( Ben laughs ) Man: I got you! Oh, I got you! Man #2: Don't try to reel him in all at once. Let him tire himself out. ( Man #1 straining ) I got him! I got him! What's it gonna take? Man #2: Depends. Once I saw-- a marlin fight-- for five hours! Five hours? Oh! Come on, you sucker! Oh, what happened? The line must have broken. - Reel it in! - Man #1: I got something. Here it is, seor. Man #1: 30 years! - Sy: Man-- - No one will know. You just gotta learn to trust me. I know where the best lobsters are. - Sy: What if-- - Stop nagging. - You're like an old woman. - I have to stay here and work. I don't want to get fired. I don't think it's a good idea. - Just relax. I'll be back. - Oh, man! 10 minutes. And I'll bring you up a five pounder. Okay, you better. You better. - I will. - C'mon, dive. Vmonos! Vmonos, amigo! Hasta luego! Man: What were you doing down there? Getting some dinner. That's a high-powered communications cable! It's not something to screw around with! I don't think it's me you've got to worry about. Man: What's that? A shark's tooth. I pried it from the underwater cable. We'll take it from here. Just be more careful in the future, okay? Okay. No one's gonna know, huh? - We're gonna hear about this. - Ruiz is not going to know. He won't find out. Cuado. Oh, jeez. ( screams ) - Sorry, Ms. Stone. - Good evening, Todd. - Working late again? - As usual. You've been running around non-stop, all day. - Why don't you take a break? - I have so much to do. I got to catalog all this stuff and get it down to the prep area. Bonn has been waiting 65 million years. I think she can wait a half-hour while you grab a sandwich. No thanks. You're always too kind. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye. Mystery shark? Oh my God! Man: Right, Mr. Ruiz. Yes, make it happen. Morning, Mr. Ruiz. - You wanted to see me? - Thanks for coming. This is Jeff Tolley, CEO at Apex Communications. Ben here is one of the resort's patrol guys. - Why don't you sit down? - Sure. Thank you. Mr. Tolley has a lot of guests staying here. Really? We're having a celebration on the launch - of our new trans-Pacific cable. - I heard about that. The harbor-master says you're bringing in a cruise liner. Tolley: Well, it's not quite that big. Some of Seor Tolley's people say that you were diving near that cable yesterday? Yeah, I was. But I wasn't messing with it, if that's what you mean. They said that... it seems something bit through the protective covering and damaged some of the fiber optics. That's right. I found a shark tooth in the cable. I'm hoping this is a random incident. Last month, we had to bury 50 miles of cable near Japan just because a cargo ship snagged it with its anchor. I'd hate to do that again here. No, the shark was probably just curious and bit the cable just to see what it was. Sharks are always biting things. Ben: I wouldn't worry about it. - Thanks for the reassurance. - No problem. - Ben, let me walk you out. - Sure. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. I hired you to keep the beaches safe and protect the guests. So from now on you will keep to your assigned patrol area. Am I clear? Yes, sir. Woman: Uh-huh. Come on. Man: Andale, come on! Come on, mi amor. Baby, don't go so far out. - Por qu? - You don't know what's out there. Are you afraid that something is going to swim up and bite your culo? ( woman screams ) It's just a sand tiger shark. Pretty ugly, but harmless unless you're a fish about that big. I heard it scared that girl so bad, she ran all the way up the street buck naked. Almost caused an accident. Ramirez will think twice about bringing a girl to this spot. So, what do we do with the shark? Get someone with a truck to cart it back to the dock. I'm sure some of the fishermen will chop it up and use it for bait. - You got it. - Cool. Do you know where I can find Ben Carpenter? - Yes, he's over there. - Hey, thanks. - I'm looking for Ben Carpenter. - That would be me. I stopped by your office and they said I might be able to catch you down here. Well, you caught me. Hi, I'm Cat Stone. I'm a marine biologist from the Sand Diego Aquarium. - I saw your message on the internet. - Well, that was fast. It must be something important for you to come here for a tooth. Oh, it's a quick flight and I enjoy the change of scenery. Besides, if your tooth is what I think it is, - it'll be worth the trip. - Then I won't keep you in suspense. Oh, great! So what's so special about it? I checked online but couldn't find a shark that'd match it. We think it's a subspecies of the mako shark. Very rare and extremely nomadic. Where did you say you found this? I pried it from an underwater cable about five miles offshore. Could I get the exact location? - Sure. - Great. You know, it's a pretty big tooth. How dangerous is this shark? No more than the regular mako. I'm just concerned about our beaches. If there's a threat, I'd really like to know. These sharks always stay out in the open ocean. I know our aquarium would love to buy this tooth from you. Keep it. Think of it as my contribution to science. Thanks. I appreciate that. So, now that you have your tooth, is it right back up to San Diego? No, I'll hang out for a couple of days and see if it might still be in the area. - I'll let you know if I find anything. - Okay. No flirting over there. We have work to do. Looks like you gotta go. Yeah... I'll see you around. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you, too. You know, you're dead meat. - Anything else? - No, thank you. - Man on phone: Hello? - Hey. It's Cat. - What's going on? - I just saw this tooth. It's genuine. - As in the real McCoy. - No. Get those video guys down here as fast as you can. I want to document all of this before I take it public. - Right. - And keep it quiet. - I'll send somebody down. - I owe you one. Okay. See ya. ( Spanish rock music plays ) Adnde vas? ( speaking Spanish ) ( speaking Spanish ) ( man and woman scream ) Oh shit! ( phone rings ) - Do you want to answer it? - Not really. - What the hell's going on? - It's the first power grid. I was running a tracer, checking the line resistance - and we lost it. - You overloaded the line? No, sir. It was well below capacity. One minute it was fine, and the next, we shorted out. Fuck! That's all I need. Call Chuck Rampart. Tell him to go out and check the cable. In the meantime, I want you code monkeys to figure out a way to make the backup system work properly. That's what I pay you for. Fuck! Tolley isn't happy? Assholes are never happy. Hey. Here there, amigo. You guys off in search of Atlantis? I wish. I got another problem with the fiber line. Trouble in a junction box 10 miles out, so... we'll take her out for a look, report back what we find. I saw a break in the cable off the coast, two days ago. A shark bit through the casing. Really? Man, they never tell me anything. So, Chuck, when will you let me pilot her? You got to pass my test on submersibles first. Don't you think I'm too old for a driver's test? Maybe. But a Jeep doesn't implode when you drive it wrong. Right. Take it easy, guys. Okay? - Adis. - Adis, amigos. You'll actually let him drive the sub? Kid's got damn good instincts. Make a hell of a submariner someday. Only if he listens to you, right? Of course. Man: I love Mexico. Man #2: Great place to be shooting. Man #1: Not a bad way to make a living. Man #2: I'm all for it. Look over there, huh? - Man #1: Let's get shooting. - All right. Let's do it. Whoa! Get the cameras. I'll check out the boat. Man #1: Yes, ma'am. Don't think I don't know you're checking out my ass, Friedman. - Who, me? Aw, come on. - Ohh, I like her. Davis, you like anything with a pair of tits. - That's true. - It is. But you're the ass man. Remember? And you'd do anything for that ass. - Fuckin' A-right, man. - Come on! - Nice. - Cat: Playing with your toys? Toys are actually what it's all about. You see, this here happens to be an underwater lipstick camera. Looks pretty small to me. Well, it's really not the size that matters. Right, buddy? Should be one hell of a POV shot if we get in close enough and stick a shark. You're going to get close all right. Get as much footage as you can get. We're pulling up to the location where they found that tooth. Guess what, boys? You start chumming. Oh, man! This really stinks. All right, sharky. Come and get it. What the hell? - Cat: Holy cow! - Is that it? Looks about the right size. Get the cameras! Freidman: All right, baby. Come and get it! Cat: You getting it? - I need to get lower. - I'll get you there, man. All right, bro'. Come on. Here we go. You're hooked, man. Davis: Yeah, all right. Cat: Watch out. Coming through. Here it comes! - Un-fucking-believable! - Did you get it? Yeah. Animal Planet, eat your heart out. - Yes! - Yes! Look out! - Shit! - What are you doing? Making sure. Yeah! That's our baby. We gotta tag it. - You got it, Cat! - You bet your balls. - Freidman: Come on, baby! - The tag's working. You guys, take a look at this. Whew! Man, she's going deep. Cat: Just keep it rolling. Holy fucking shit. We got this baby. - Yeah! We got it! - She's happy! Good boy! Come on. Thattaboy. Come on over here. Here we go! Thattaboy! Good catch! Come on, bring it here. Good boy! Come on. Oh, go get it, Dirty! Come on! Go! Go! Jeez! Stupid dog! I don't know why I bring you. Well, here! Catch it! Get it, boy! Get it! Wow, this is as surprise. - Late night social call? - Resort security matter. Sounds official. There's been a shark attack. Come in. Excuse the mess. I've been working. - I can see that. - And... trying to quit smoking. - How's it going? - Terrible. - So tell me what happened. - It's serious. We found a guy's leg near a beach where he was playing Frisbee with his dog. Oh my God. Cataline Stone. Paleontologist? San Diego Natural History Museum. So I guess this means you're not a marine biologist. - You lied to me? - I had to. - Why? - This shark isn't a rare species. It's supposed to be extinct. Megalodon-- ancestor to the great white shark. It can grow in excess of 75 feet long... Ben: Jesus! with a 10 foot wide bite. One of these things is swimming off my coast? No. You have a 15 feet long baby swimming off your coast. But it's a damn dinosaur. How did it get here? That's what I'm trying to find out. You should have told me the truth. - Like you would have believed me. - That's not the point! You knew what it was. You had a responsibility. I didn't know the shark would be a danger. Tell that to the family of the man who's dead. This thing is obviously dangerous. We've got to get rid of it. - You can't just kill it. - Watch me. Do you know what we can learn from this? It's like finding a Tyrannosaurus rex in your backyard. Cat, I don't see that as being a good thing. Ben, wait! I know what you're going to ask, so don't even say it. - Fine. How will you find it? - I'll find it. You'll have a hard time without this. - You tagged it? - Yes, I did. I can come within 10 meters of that shark. - Close enough to bite you. - I could confiscate that thing. You could try. Or you could come work on my boat. - I don't like playing games. - Neither do I. So what do you say we both get what we want? I can study the shark and you can protect your beaches. Beats cruising around in circles all day. Lo siento. All right. But at the first sign of trouble, I'm taking it out. Fair enough. Smart-ass! Sy: Well, excuse me! How can this shark still be alive after all this time? Some scientists believe the Megalodon survived the extinction of the dinosaurs and the ice age by living in deep-water trenches. And no one's seen one after all this time? Hey, guys, check this out. I was going through yesterday's footage. Take a look at this. Wait, you put a camera on the shark? You gotta love the sharkcam, man. Is that the cable where you found the tooth? Yeah, that's the Apex cable. Hey, guys! We're getting a signal. West-18. That's about a half-mile due northeast. - Okay. - Get the cameras ready, boys. - You got it! - Let's go. David: Uh, it's-- it's headed due east. Ben: East. Due east. Jesus, it's headed for the resort. Full throttle, now! There it is! Jimmy, this is Ben. - What is it? - A shark's heading for the shore. Get everyone out of the water, now! Shark! Shark! Everybody out of the water! Shark! Shark! Everybody out of the water! Out of the water, everybody! Shark! Shark! Everybody out of the water! Shark! Shark! Everybody out of the water! Everybody... out! Ben: Faster! Go! Faster! Put the gun down! ( screaming ) What are you doing? I had it in my sight. You did it! He's heading back out to sea. - Problem solved. No one got hurt. - We were lucky! We were very lucky. It's fast. What's our speed? We're barely keeping pace at 20 knots. Ben: Oh no! Faster. It's headed for that boat. All right, bro'! Muy bien! Yes, sir! Guys! Oh shit, it's gonna ram them! Shark! Pull in! Shark! Shark! Guys! Hey! Move! Move! Hola! Como ests? Hey! Move the boat! Move! ( speaking Spanish ) Oh, shit! Go! - We're not going to make it! - Shit! Aydame! Pedro! No! The shark's dragging her out to sea! Ben: Pull over! This guy needs medical attention! Gimme a hand here. Wait! Help me get him in the boat. Man: Help me, please! Cat: Hurry! Come on, Ben! Hurry, Ben! Hurry! Give me the wheel. We have to save her. Hang on! Ben: Easy. Watch your head. Woman: Help! Help me! No, no. She's going down! Oh my God! Oh my God! Hang on! - Go down and help her! - Help me! Help me! Come here! Hold on to my hand! Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. - Hold on to me! - Get her in! We're damn lucky. We're indemnified against legal action. You're talking about legal action when two people have been killed. You knew about this Jurassic shark and didn't tell me. - I thought I could handle it! - You thought wrong! I can kill the shark. But we need to close the beaches. People pay a lot of money to come down here and they expect to use everything including the beaches! You can not let people swim in the water when there's a shark out there! Okay, let me handle the beaches. I'll come up with something. But kill this thing quickly and quietly. Understood. Ben: Hey... it's okay. No, it's not okay. I've studied fossils my whole life. Nothing but theories and guesses... This was my one chance to prove that I was right. Look what happened. All those people are dead. And it's all my fault. - Don't blame yourself. - How could I be so blind? Did you see that girl? She was so scared. And I had seconds and I could have saved her life. Cat, what's done is done. There's nothing we can do. What we have to do now is stop anyone else from getting hurt. I was looking at the video of the shark hugging the cable. Do you have any idea why it's attracted to it? It could be electromagnetic or visual stimuli. What's running through that cable? It's fiber optics. I don't know the specifics. But I do have a friend who's working on the project. Chuck: Prehistoric, huh? That's right. Prehistoric. Damndest thing I ever heard. Could the fiber be emitting something? Low-level electrical field. Not enough to harm anything. But maybe enough to attract something. In the '80s, AT& had problems with sharks biting though their fiber cables. Their cable installation was too thin. Electricity bleeding through the water. The same could be happening here. Let me show you something. This section of cable here in Mexico connects to North America, South America, then 10 miles south, branches off to Australia and Japan. The whole system's set to go online in... two days. It looks like the cable goes near several deep-water trenches. Yeah. I lost a good buddy in an accident... right about here. Near the Challenger deep trench. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. We know the Meg's attracted to the cable. And with it running this close to the trenches, it could have drawn it out of the deep blue sea and lead it here. That cable goes to full power, there is no telling how many of these Megs we'll have on our hands. We can't let that system go online. Guys... you'll have a hard time convincing Tolley to delay a billion-dollar project over... what, some sharks and a hunch? Yeah, he's right. We don't have enough proof. And we have to deal with the Meg that's out there now. All right. I'll check Apex's computer files, see what I can find. Do you have access? I will when I'm done hacking. Ben: You know what? We'll need all the help we can get. Let's go. - Davis: Hey. - Hey. - You guys take that? - Yeah. Yo, easy, easy, easy. Now... are you sure this will kill it? If you want, I can test it out on Freidman first. I heard that. Smart-ass. - Is everything stowed? - Everything's stowed. Cat: Let's roll. Come on, baby. Come on. Here's your password. "Power bleed-through." You knew it was leaking. What else are you hiding, Tolley? Son of a bitch! The Pacific Horizon is prepared for tomorrow. What's the final head count? 46 guests. 46 investors! You don't throw $100,000 on a party cruise if they're just guests. Yes, sir. It'll be first class all the way. You fucking knew! Assistant: Security, get in here! You knew, and you didn't warn them? I don't know what you're talking about. Bullshit! It's all right here. The diving accidents. Seven men dead! Including my friend. You knew it was dangerous and you let them dive. They knew it was risky. Some things weren't accounted for. Bull-fucking-shit! You knew something was happening! And you covered it up! You're finished, Tolley. When the press gets a hold of you, they'll rip you an new asshole. Go tell your story. Who would believe you, a disgruntled employee with stolen confidential documents? My lawyers will have a field day with you. - They are the real sharks. - This isn't over yet, Tolley! - Not by a long shot! - Get him out of here! Esai, this is Ben. Are you there? Yeah, go ahead, Ben. Nothing on our end, so far. Where are you at? I'm about five miles south of Peridor. I haven't seen a thing. Maybe your shark skipped out. Ben: I doubt it. Let me know if you see anything. Okay. Okay, okay. West of our position about one mile. - All right, I'm on it. - Ben: Esai, we found it. We're two miles northwest of the resort jetty. - I'm on my way. - 10-4. Cat, take this. Let's get this going. Come on, you mother. Come to papa. He's gone under. Slow down. Jesus! Son of a bitch! Hold on! - Yes! - Got it. Son of a bitch! Davis, you okay? Davis? - I'll get my shotgun. - Davis, come on. Come on, don't do this. - Davis! - Come on, Davis! Davis, come on! ( Cat screams ) Help! Help me! What--? Cat! Cat! Cat! Don't move! Stay where you are! Die, God damn it! Die! Die! Son of a bitch! Die! Die! You're extinct, fucker! - Are you guys okay? - Yeah. - Davis, you all right? - Yeah. - Oh, shit! - ( boat horn blows ) Ben: Hey! Esai! Esai, we're taking on water! I'll be right there. - Esai! - Over here! Hey, over here! Sy: Help me! Holy fucking shit! Oh my God! Shit! Ben: Get up on top! Use your feet. They're over there! - No! - Oh my God! ( helicopter approaching ) Oh, shit! What was that? Look at that. Look at the tooth. Look at the size of that. This is our proof. I'll hold onto it. Shit! Hey! Don't fall. Hey! Hurry! Give me your hand. Just take it easy. Ben: Hold on! Don't let go. Get us out of here! Ben: Don't let go! Come on! Come on! You got it. Climb. - You okay, Ben? - Yeah. - What the hell was that? - You don't want to know. Esai is dead and so are two other people! - What are you talking about? - Another Megalodon killed them! Another one? You said you'd take care of it. We killed it. But its mother's huge! - How big? - Larger than a Greyhound bus. - Bullshit! - Look. That's what you're dealing with. You can't keep this quiet. We have got a 60-foot shark swimming off our coast that's not going to go away. We have to tell the authorities! And tell the world we've got a dinosaur swimming off our beaches? - You won't blow the whistle? - No. Fine. Then I will. Cat: What happened? - I just quit. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious. - Hector gave me the news. - You guys all right? - We're okay. Apex knew about the Megalodons. Tolley turned a blind eye and counted his money. - We've got bigger problems. - You got that right. I just went to the police but... they don't have the resources to help out. - What about the Navy? - I tried. But Navy won't violate 12-mile limit. I called the Coast Guard. They can get a cutter down. - When? - Not until the end of next week. That's not quick enough. So what do we do? We handle it ourselves. I know where we can get explosives. No questions asked. We'll use the minisub, plant the charges, blow the cable at the junction box. That'll prevent Apex from turning on the system. But we still have to deal with the Meg. We know it's attracted to electricity. Let's use it to our advantage. I could string together a series of high-voltage batteries. That'll be enough to bring him to us. - And how do we kill it? - We don't want to wound it and have it swim back out to sea. We want something that will not miss it. I got something you ought to see. The Mark 44 torpedo. Taken out of service 15 years ago. Travels at 55 knots. Has a range of 10 miles. Where did you get that thing? The last sub I was on was decommissioned. Lot of hardware. It's better here than in a scrap heap. Does it work? It'll blow a hole clear through the hull of a battleship. - What about a shark? - Abso-fuckin-lutely. Okay, so the torpedo's hooked up and armed. Are we ready? The Mark 44 torpedo launch system's nominal, but-- there's a wrinkle. It wasn't designed for a biological target. It needs something mechanical... or electrical. We need to tag the Meg with this. It'll send out a signal to the torpedo. But somebody has to get close to the shark. Not necessarily. Where'd you learn to use a crossbow? I did a little deer hunting in my day. All right, you two... get some sleep. Yes, sir. We'll meet back here at 8:00 a.m. Don't be late. - I'm exhausted. - Yeah, me too. But I'm really wired. Shall I take you home and eat your pussy? Okay. The sardines are in the can. Copy that. We'll shadow you from above. - You two be careful down there - Yeah, we'll be fine. Okay. Let's get this circus underway. ( lounge music playing ) All right, talk to me. The harbor-master has barred any boats from leaving the bay. - The fine is $5,000. - Fine, pay it. You know how much is riding on this today, how much money is standing on that boat right now. That's my future and yours. - It'll be fine. - It better be. Don't worry. A friend of mine here has brought us a little insurance. Just in case that shark shows up. Good. Let's go. All right. We're closing in. - Ben: Getting close. - Copy that. - What was that? - Clear air turbulence. It happens when you fly this low. - You'll get used to it. - Not likely. Okay, Ben. It's all yours. Okay, we're hooked on. Back away. Nice and easy. Piece of cake, right? Now the dot.coms are all going under. Hey, how are you? Nice to see you. Hey, how's it going? I'll see you later. Hey, how's it going? Here's the cheers, honey. Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention for a moment? I would like to thank all of you for coming on... what I'm sure will be a landmark day for Apex Communications. Today... we begin official use... of a new generation of communication technology. Okay. We're clear by now. You want the honors? Okay, Porter. This is for you. That cable is history. Man: Dude, we just lost the main junction box. Man #2: Well, switch to the backup router. Man #1: I can't. There's nothing there. The whole line's completely dead. Should we call Tolley? Not unless you want to make the call. Take a look at that. - We've got a problem. - Go ahead. - There's a yacht out on the water. - The harbor-master was supposed - to bar all traffic. - Somebody didn't listen. Within the next two years, we plan to build an entire network of fiber optic cables... spanning the globe and bringing the world together as never before. ( guests clap ) Ladies and gentlemen, I propose a toast: to the future of Apex. Hear, hear! Cheers. - Where is your insurance? - What? - The fucking grenade! - It's upstairs. Mayday! Mayday! This is the Pacific Horizon. We've been struck and the controls are not responding. - Mayday! - What's going on? The shark is attacking the ship. Drop the box... and try to lure the shark away so you can tag it. - We're getting there. - Copy that. I'm dropping the box. ( electric static ) Let's go. Hold it steady. Hold it steady. - Son of a bitch! - I missed it. Don't worry. We'll figure something out. - Here, take the wheel. - What? What are you doing? Always carry a spare. It's the Navy way. Whoa, Jesus! Okay. Time to get wet. Take the sub. There it is! Throw the grenade! Jesus, what the hell was that? Toss another one! God damn it! One, two, three! Chew on that! Come on! Come on! Come on to daddy!
