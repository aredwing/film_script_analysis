I thought you were going to count. How could I be counting? I'm thinking of names. Come on, William. I depend on you. This is important to me. I think this was my personal best. I don't ever remember doing this well before. This was definitely a better run than my Debbie Reynolds one. Debbie Reynolds one? Now we gotta go back and count. l gotta count all the stars again.

Thanks. -Favorite movie? -Gone with the Wind. First movie you ever saw? -The Mummy. -Boris Karloff. I was a young kid with my dad. I wasn't feeling well. My dad let me stay up and watch Fright Night. You know what I could never figure out about the mummy? The mummy used to walk with one arm out and a leg dragging behind. He was still always able to get his victim. Im thinking as a kid, "Im pretty fast. "Just put some moves on the mummy, "and the mummy would never get me." This is what you're thinking about? Then I realize the mummy never has to sleep. Eventually, Id get tired of running around the mummy. That's when he'd get me. So what did you do? Scare yourself to death thinking you were going to sleep and the mummy was coming in your room at night? This schmuck, this mummy is in Cairo. He's got to take a plane from Egypt to Philadelphia. This mummy has got to get a passport, and you're worried he's coming in your room at night? This mummy's got more important things on its mind. You know what I could never figure out about the mummy was how he used to walk around with one arm out -and a leg dragging behind him. -William. William, you're blanking. Did I say that? Trust me. I did say that. Watch the radio. I got to go to the bathroom. You see this? We're going to make a withdrawal. Oh, God. Of all the people, you have to pick on me? I make very little money. Two hundred's not going to kill you. Just hurry up. Two hundred? I never use these machines at night. Im always afraid. Just shut up and get on with it. Im wrong. "Enter again." Lady, don't provoke me! Don't touch my back, please. You make me nervous. Don't provoke me. Just give me the money! Wait, wait. "Processing." "No funds?" -What do you mean? -I can't believe it! I don't have any money in my account. -All right, give me your purse. -I don't have any money, man. I don't have anything. Pick it up. Pick it up! No. If I do, then you'll hit me in the head. Take what you want. I don't have anything. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. Okay, pick up the car keys. Go ahead. Pick up the car keys. Where's your car? It's the blue Mazda. -Okay, come on. -Okay, no, listen, -if you want the car, you have the car. -No, no, no. Understand? Gun. -Do you speak English? Okay. -Yes, yes, yes. -I want you to get into the car... -No, no. Listen to me. If you want the car, just take it. -I won't say anything. -I just want you to get into the car. -I don't want to get into an argument! -Don't touch me! If you want the car, you have the car! Take it! Oh, shit. Would you put your fucking hands... You get up, you big tub of guts. Jimmy. -Jimmy. -Hey. Some guy just held me up at the ready teller. -What? -He had a gun in my back. -He wanted $200. -The lowlife scum. What the fuck is going on in this world today? Will somebody tell me what kind of sick world this is we live in? Tell me what happened. Don't leave anything out. I couldn't get money from the machine. I didn't have any. -He wanted me to get in the car. -Don't tell me you got in the car. -You didn't get in the car? -No. I threw the keys away, and he ran off. Lowlife scum. Scum of the earth. I'll tell you, it was smart not to get in the car. I knew I wasn't going to get into the car. Definitely smart not to get in the car. -What did he get? -He didn't get anything. I didn't have any money in my account. Honey, Im sorry. Im sorry. Don't worry. Its a good thing I took that money. -You took the money? -Yeah. Definitely the right move. You mean you took my money? What the hell is wrong with you? I borrowed the card. I had a crisis with my bus bench advertisement. What are you talking about? I have a bus bench on Sunset right near the gates of Bel Air, big traffic flow area. They're looking for an actor, boom, they see me. Jimmy, you stole my money. "Stole" is a harsh word, honey. I used it as an investment in us. In us? In you, not in us! The phone could ring any moment. That could be the call. Next thing you know, Im in a series. Then we're living on the Westside. Bam! It happens just like that. We're on our way. You don't have that bullshit job anymore. Boom! We're on our way. You took my money. How could you take my money like that? You know how strong I am as an actor. Im bound to be recognized. You really are a sick nut, you know that? -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. "Ring, ring." Any moment. Boom, we're on our way. That money sits there at the gates of Bel Air right now, gathering momentum! It was a good thing, and you should thank your lucky stars that I got that money out before that scumbag did. How many times have I told you not to go in my purse? Don't ever go into my purse again. Ever! Kid... I think it'd be a good idea if you'd hand over your gun. You want to look for this guy? You think you could recognize him? What? I say you think you could recognize him? I want to look for this guy. Ill kill the motherfucker if I find him, trying to take your money. Please just spare me this, will you? Why? You think Im kidding? Huh? You think Im fooling around? Yeah? Im fooling around? See this? I find him, Ill put him away. -What are you doing with a gun? -Lowlife scum. Jesus Christ! Are you crazy? Blanks. William gave me the gun and the blanks. That's a smart idea. A gun with blanks. Its all an illusion. That's all it is. Put that away, please. You make me nervous with that thing. That's the whole point. That's the whole point. That's the point Im trying to make. You made it for me. It frightens you. See? A guy terrified you today with a gun. Its terrible. It was terrifying, right? A guy pulled a gun on you. That's why I want to get him. l mean, you know, it shouldn't be. -You still scared? You all right? -Yeah. Be careful with my heart. -Huh? -Be careful with my heart. Self-promotion. That's what it's about. You can't rely on agents. Do it yourself. That's what I say. You'll see, those calls are going to start coming in. You can bank on it. Then, with the contacts I make, you become Lorraine De la Pena, haircutter to the stars. Yeah, but in the meantime, are you going to get a job, Jimmy? -Im working on it. Im working on it. -Okay. -You're handsome. -Yeah? Well, you know what they say. The camera can only photograph what it sees. Not bad. -What you doing out here, man? -Hey. Jimmy Alto. Mr. Meyerhoff sent me. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. Come on in. I been out there since 6:30. What time you open? You ought to get the coffee going 'cause about 7:00, they're gonna be in here. Right. You know how to work one of these things, right? -Yeah, sure. -All right. Cool. Go on to it, then. -So, Mr. M tell me you an actor, huh? -Right. Yeah. I seen you in anything? You ever see that show Matlock, the role of Cliff? You was on that show? No. I was up for the role of Cliff. -You was up for the role? -Yeah, I was up for the role. Let me tell you something about this business, okay? Between you and me, and it goes no further. No problem. I gave a hell of a reading for that part, but I think they felt I was a little too strong for Andy Griffith. Really? I blew Andy Griffith off the screen. I mean that's how strong I am. You understand? I mean, I know this guy. I had that part, too. But, you know, there's a lot of politics involved... -Yeah, lots of it. -...and not necessarily how good you are. And Im a little intimidating, you know? -Im so strong, I intimidate other actors. -Well, you know, man, I just thought they wanted to get the best actor. You know, that's what I thought. Its not always about talent. I hear that. So, man, you know what you're doing here, right? -Stack up about a half dozen of these. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. You good to go, right? You know how to do this, right? I did this in a Broadway show. -You was on Broadway, man? -Well, off-Broadway. Off-Broadway? Off-off-Broadway, but they're all the same. -People don't understand. -I hear you. I hear you. Well, you know what? Im going to go off-off-Broadway. -Let's get this cooking started. All right? -All right. -You good to go, right? -I got it. All right. I think there's something wrong with the button. Well, why don't you try the off-off-Broadway button? Id like a half a cup of coffee. I only wanted half a cup of coffee. Im thinking of putting together a one-man show. -Tour de force kind of thing. -Yeah. That way you don't have some other actors dragging you down, you know? A one-man show, that's the way to go. I got to find some piece that really shows my... My... I don't know, I can't find the words. Like homeboy with the big mustache? You know, the Huckleberry Finn dude? What his name? -Mark Twain? -Yeah, yeah. I could do Mark Twain. I could do that. But I need something that stretches me more, you know. Something that really challenges me. Something that'll show off my talents and my abilities. Yeah, well, why don't you show your talents and abilities on this here? Like to go to movie premieres? -Hey, what the hell is this? -What up? What up? There's nobody here. I mean, how do I know who gets what? Oh, man. Where everybody at? Are they outside? They're all outside. Something's going on. Back up on the curb. -I saw it out of the corner of my eye. -Everyone, please get back up on the curb! Back behind the cones! French toast, right? Pastry and a coffee, half decaf, half regular. -Eggs over? -What, are you on glue? Portuguese sausage. -Portuguese sausage? -That's right. You were in this restaurant? -Cream cheese and bagel? -Lox and bagel. -Whitefish. -Whitefish? I've been looking for you. How am I gonna do this? How am I gonna do this? Got him! All right! Terrific! Way to go! All right for the boys in blue! And girls, too! I don't know who gets what here. Fuck it! This shit's getting cold! Soup's on! Has anyone seen the corned beef hash? Hey, waiter! Hey, shorty! Hey, hey. I asked for scrambled eggs. Scrambled eggs. These are not scrambled eggs! -Now they're scrambled! -What about my egg whites? -Whitefish! -I found the whitefish. I don't know where your toast is! Give me the bagel. Another half cup of coffee! Suck it off the floor. I like it hot! Waiter! You eat this! Mr. Alto, is this a cafeteria? No. Then he says, "That's what I thought." I hired a waiter, so this is not a cafeteria. I said, "Yeah, but I had this problem." He says, "I can hire. I can fire." End of story. End of job. -What are you going to do now? -What am I gonna do? Sometimes you gotta take the bad with the strong. Is that an expression? I don't know. Its new to me. Yeah, it's a new expression. Hey, there goes John. He's winding up for the pitch. Want to watch him again? What the hell's that all about? Why does he do that? I told you. Tell me that again. The story goes they brought him up to the majors. They brought him in. Relief pitch, crucial game, something like that. First pitch he threw, boom. Gave up a home run, lost the game never pitched again in the majors. Supposedly what he's doing is always re-enacting that pitch, trying to get it right, living that moment. Boom. -Any of this sound familiar to you? -Huh? Come on. Ill do it again for you tomorrow. Hell of a thing going through life living that moment over and over again, regretting that you never got it right, you never had another chance. Poor fuck. Im not gonna spend my life living the same moment over and over again. Im going to beat it. Lorne Greene didn't happen in his 20s or even in his 30s. All of a sudden, boom, the guy shows up on Bonanza he's got white hair. He hung in there. You know, he was in there for the long haul. l got to hand it to Lorne, he hung in there. Nothing's ever going to stop me. Nothing. Bet he was a good pitcher in his day. What? What do you want to do? You want to catch a movie? I don't know. What's playing? I don't know. Id like to see Gone with the Wind. -Gone with the Wind? -Yeah. Gone with the Wind, you want to see? I don't know, William. Nothing from me rubs off on you. I don't understand it. From this moment on, Hollywood stars will be recognized as unparalleled fundraisers and morale builders in time of war. After the war, however, Hollywood turns another face to the world. In the '20s and '30s it becomes a lotus land whose godlike inhabitants seem sublimely above common concern. And this is... Oh, shit. One fucking time. Don't tell me. Don't fucking tell me! One fucking time l leave the fucking radio there. One time. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! What? Get out of the street. -Son of a bitch! -Come on! Come on. Get out of the street. -Come on! Hey! -Son of a bitch! Come on! Get the fuck out of the street! Hey, what is it, what is it? Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Get out of the street! -Can't you see I gotta... What are you going to do, run me over, here? Hey, hey! Hey, get out of the car! Can't you see I got a fucking problem here? They stole my radio! Stupid son of a bitch! Jesus! -Hi. -Hey. What are you guys doing? Some lowlife scum stole my car radio. -Oh, where? -Right outside. Yeah, they said there have been six or seven stolen this past week. That's epidemic proportions. What is the gun and the video camera all about? Well, the police aren't going to do anything about it. They don't care. This is a two-hour battery. What are you guys supposed to be doing? Im gonna catch the thief myself. Video him. This is a good idea. Have you lost your mind? Have you gone completely and totally nuts? You know what it's like to find your car violated, huh? Your car radio gone. Something you care about gone, and nobody's going to do anything about it? Yeah. Jimmy, it's just a radio car. I want something done. I want satisfaction. You just gonna wait outside, -Wait for someone to break into a car? -That's right. Im going to videotape him in the act, arrest him, and hand him over to the police. Some couples, they spend their Saturday evenings going to movies or clubs. My boyfriend is going to be in the bushes, looking for some thief. Do you have any idea how absurd this is? William, will you get that away from my face? Im sorry. I was just checking the autofocus at a low light. Im sorry. I must have lost my mind. Hey, Will, these blanks are not all the same size. I wasn't taping. -What day is this? -The fifth. -Its not the fourth? -Fifth. Wednesday the fifth? Tuesday the 5th. Is this the beginning of Tuesday, or was it Tuesday? What Im saying is, is this last night, or is it now tomorrow, the fifth? This day is the fifth. It has begun the fifth, not ending the fifth. On the sixth I got to get my head checked out. The accident. It feels pretty good, though, doesn't it? Yeah, except for the buzzing and humming, whatever that is. Still? -What did the doctor say? -When? You said you had an appointment on the sixth. This is the seventh. What did he say? I don't remember anything that important. Up or down? Make sure you don't get me in the shot, okay? Okay. Can't see him very well yet, can you? No, Im not focused yet. The filthy cretin. This is weird. I feel dizzy. I don't know why anybody bothers to roll up their windows. They steal your radio, and then you gotta have your windows redone. Scumbags. Okay, this is it. Come on. Let's get him. Okay, scumball, get out of the car. What are you, cops? No, FBI. Come on. Get out of the car. Get out! Put the radio up. Put it up. Got that? What the hell's going on here? Never mind. We're going to take a little walk to the squad car. Come on. Pick your stuff up. Come on. Got my radio in there, too, probably? Sure. Who do you work for, Radio Shack? Now, where do you sell these radios? Where do you sell these radios? I will kill you. Don't try me. Are you gonna fuck with me? -1149 North Western Avenue, sir. -That's a good boy. Did you write the note for the police? -Was I supposed to write the note? -Yes. What are you doing? Im writing the note. That's a labeling machine. I know. I just don't want the police to recognize my handwriting. Pardon moi. Here's an unusual story. Hollywood police report that a robbery suspect was left in front of the police station early this morning. Two car radios, which he is accused of stealing, were taped to his body. That, according to a videotape and note which accompanied the radios. -Do you want a little conditioner? -Yes, I do. No further information is available. Police say the note stated, "To the police, "this guy stole two car radios last night. "This is a video of his thievery. "If you can't do the job, we can. "Signed, the S.O.S." There's no information on the size of this S.O.S. or what their intentions may be. We'll keep you updated as more information on this becomes available. -In other news, a Hollywood man... -Jimmy. -That my phone? -No. Jimmy. Hey, honey. I just thought Id get some sun. I read in the trades they're looking for a newcomer for that new movie Urban Nomad. Get a little color on my face. I want to talk to you. -What? -I want to talk to you! Well, sit down. Not here. William, you, too. -So you did it, didn't you? -What? The car radio guy. Dropping him off at the police station. You actually did it. Didn't you? Well, it just so happens, yes. But how did you know? I saw it on the news. -News? It got on the news? -Yeah. No kidding? Its bad enough what the two of you did, but did you have to leave that note? Well, I mean, you got to understand the circumstances. So you guys are now the S.O.S. What? The note. You guys are now the S.O.S. -What did you put in that note? -I just signed it. I mean, it had to come from somebody. Yeah, but where'd you come up with S.O.S.? Its that movie producer guy. What movie producer guy? Its his initials. The guy who did Gone with the Wind. David O. Selznick? David? I thought his name was Steven. No. Steven is Spielberg. David is O. Selznick. I love that Gone with the Wind. Please, this is serious. The television believes there's some kind of an organization, some kind of vigilante organization. You shouldn't have did that, William. I mean, you shouldn't have done that. I wanted to draw attention to the crime, not the Steven O. Selznick gang. Just what you need. The police are looking for terrorists or something like that. Jimmy, you has to promise me that this is finished. Lorraine, this is no big to-do. Its all over with. Its over. -Really? -Yes, it's over with. She's got a point, though, William. You know, keeping quiet on this. "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." Wasn't that Gone with the Wind? Yes, that was Gone With the Wind. And it was also David O. Selznick. S.O.S. Steven O. Selznick. How long did they run it? -Three and a half hours. -No. Gone with the Wind was a little over three and a half hours. -Yeah, but they... -Im asking about the news, the report on the S.O.S. It was three and a half hours? What'd they do, a mini-series on the S.O.S. soap pads? Thought it was Gone with the Wind. No, it was 15 minutes. I know how long Gone with the Wind was. What channel was it on? -That wasn't on that Spanish station. -No, no, no. English, English. -BBC? It was international? -No. No. RBR? No. RBZ. RBZ. We don't have RBZ in this country, Lorraine. -ABC? -No. Other letters. -NBC? -NBC! That's right. Bingo! I feel like I won something. The suspect was apprehended by a group that calls itself the S.O.S. This note was made available by police officials. "To the Police: "This guy stole two car radios last night. "This is a video of his thievery. "If you can't do the job, we can. "Signed, the S.O.S." The police say they have no previous information on this S.O.S. It seems to be their first act. The size of the group is undetermined. Elsewhere in local news... S.O.S. I like that. I wish Id known they were gonna put it on television though, you know. I would've made you write something with a little more flair to it. Punched it up for you a little bit. More dramatic. -The "thievery" I thought was good. -Which? What are you talking? What are you talking about? Im talking to myself. Just ranting. Going on and on about nothing. Have some more of this tortilla. She cooks this real good. I know. Got potatoes in there, eggs, everything. Its good for you. You get eggs. You don't even have to have breakfast. They let the guy go, and they're looking for the S.O.S. I mean, isn't it amazing? Here we are, trying to do good, helping to protect, and what do they do? They're looking for the kidnappers of this lowlife scumbag. All of a sudden we're the villains, the S.O.S. -Hey, is that your ad? -Yeah. You look better in your photo. Fuck you! Fuck you! All of a sudden this fucking schmuck knows something. He knows something. It looks the same. It looks the same, right? This is crazy. They're looking for the head of the organization. They wanna know what his name is. -Who? -The head of the organization. Who is he? There is no head of the organization. If they're thinking there's an organization, then who's the head of the organization? I don't know what you're talking about. Remember years ago, the S.L.A. with Patty Hearst? This guy Cinque was the head of the S.L.A. That being the case, the S.O.S. needs a spokesman. That'll be my role. Ill be the spokesman. The recent decision by the police to release the prisoner... How does it look if I stand like this? It looks like you don't have any arms, kind of. It looks like... -No arms? Is that stronger? -Stronger? I don't know. -How about this? How about this? -That's good. -Its good? -I like that. Its like, you know, Superman used to stand like this. -Remember he used to stand like this? -Yeah. All right. How's this? Don't... Don't go like this. You just throw me off. Im trying to get into the thing here and you... Don't do that. -What do you want me to do? -Well, just nod or something. l mean, I know it's running, l know you're ready. I mean you don't have to... -Im pausing it right now. -This isn't, this isn't... Ill shake my head. -Okay. -Okay. Are you gonna keep shaking your head? Don't keep shaking it. You don't have to. -Just once is enough, okay? -Okay. This is J-Three, head of the S.O.S. No. Let me do it again. Let me do it again. This is J-Three, cell leader for the S.O.S. That cell leader's got a nice ring to it. Don't you think? -Keep the tape rolling. -Okay. Keep tape rolling. Don't stop. This is J-Five, cell leader of the S.O.S. The recent decision by... Hold on. This is K-Four, cell leader of the S.O.S. Has K-Four been used for something else before? K-2 is a mountain. K-9 is a dog. Like the Js better? Who am I? You're the leader of the S.O.S. I know that, William, but who is J-Three? What do I think? What do I feel? How do I know? You see, William, you got to think of this in acting terms. What happened to me? Where am I at this point in time in my life? What happened to get me where I am? They stole your radio. William, this isn't me. This is the leader of the S.O.S. I don't want to play me. Jimmy Alto isn't the leader of the S.O.S. J-Three is the leader of the S.O.S. Who is J-Three? William? As an actor, when you know who you are, it's easy to talk. When you don't, you don't know what's coming next, you don't know where you are. Im an actor playing a vigilante. That's not enough. That's not enough! Who am I? Who am I? I have to know who I am. Until I know who I am, the S.O.S. can't make a statement. Is that my phone? No. This is Jericho, cell leader of the S.O.S. Let it be known from this day forth that lawlessness will not be tolerated. This is a promise to all the good citizens of Hollywood. We give fair warning to the police and to the judicial system. Protect and serve the good people of Hollywood, because we will be watching and waiting. This is our pledge. S.O.S. Save our streets. -Jimmy. -This tape was given exclusively -to Channel 5 News. -What have you done? We have shown it to the police, who have issued a statement to the effect that this type of organization will not be tolerated. They have further stated that they will fully mobilize the police force to combat the S.O.S., should this illegal criminal behavior show itself again. As to the leader of the S.O.S., the police are not discussing any clues they may have at this time. Earlier this afternoon, a storefront fire in the Fairfax district threatened several commercial structures. The blaze broke out in a vacant building in the 400 block of North Fairfax Avenue. I thought I was pretty good. What'd you think? I don't know. It took 35 or 40 goes to get it. I kind of lost my perspective. Is she okay? l better go see what her problem is. I wanted to at least let Hollywood know that there was somebody there. The way it was left, it felt open-ended. I had to put a cap on it. This is the end now. Really? -What'd you think of the work? -The work? Yeah, the work. What'd you think of Jericho? Jimmy, you're playing with fire here, and you want to know how your acting was? Did you believe him? Yes, yes. I believe him. Did he seem sympathetic? See, I felt there was a vulnerability. I mean, I thought there was toughness, but, you know, there was vulnerability. Terry Malloy, On The Waterfront. -Brando. He had vulnerability. -Yeah. Remember that scene I always play for you? -What? -Eva Marie Saint. She drops the glove. He picks it up, tries to put it on his hand. He was a boxer, a tough guy, and he's trying to put a little white glove on his hand. Macho into femininity. It happened all at the same time. I mean, don't forget, I was at a disadvantage. I mean, I was in the shadows. You couldn't see my eyes. It all had to be done with the voice. You know, put me at a big disadvantage, but I thought I came across threatening, tough and vulnerable. I had vulnerability, too, right? -Yeah. -Yeah. Okay. Im gonna take a bath. You know, another thing you got to remember, too. Its the first time I played Jericho. I mean, Im not gonna do it, but imagine if I got more familiar with him. If I was allowed to do an instead of a one-minute clip, think of it that way. This is a promise to all the good citizens of Hollywood. We give fair warning to the police and to the judicial system to protect and serve the good people of Hollywood, because we will be watching and waiting. -This is our pledge. -Its even better with repeated viewing. S.O.S. Save our streets. Definitely better with repeated viewing. Jimmy. Men with ties. -Detectives, looks like. -Yeah. You think they're looking into the S.O.S.? The car radio guy could've told them the street. Wonder if they'll come and question me. Be interesting questioning me. Don't you think? I could do a real number if they question me. Where were you on the night of so-and-so? I could really do a number. Do you want to go out for breakfast and leave me at work? Yeah. Yeah. You know, if they question me, I could play it real quiet. Long pauses, you know. Id drive them crazy. Pause. Pause. Id play this real deliberate kind of a guy. Ill make them nuts. They just didn't know is what I think they were saying. They mentioned an MRI and they said maybe they'd see something. 'Cause I definitely don't remember things well. I don't know. What do you think, Jimmy? I don't know. "This is MRI. This is MRI." -I think Jericho's better. -Got you a lollipop. -Is that root beer? -No. No? Ill like root beer. You know, when you get this MRI, you're gonna see everything's gonna be okay. So don't worry, you know? You're just a little preoccupied. That's why you're blanking. -You think so? -Yeah. Look at this. We gotta get right behind this bus now. These people, they kill everybody with these fumes. They should put something on these things. I mean, look. This is disgusting. -How big is this part? -Its a nice little role. It takes place in one of the underground clubs. Yeah? Well, I mean, if this isn't a lead role, I might be wasting my time. Don't you have some other principal roles there? No, these are the roles we're casting. I understand that, but what about the principal roles? Were they already cast? This is what we're casting right now. I can't tell you about anything else. Well, I came for a principal role. Well, this is all we have. The ad in the trades said a principal role. This is not a principal role. This is a little role here, one line. Do you have a picture and resume? He's got his own bus bench ad. He's right. I have a bus bench right on Sunset. Right at the gates of Bel Air. A big advertisement, cost me a lot of money, and as we speak I have new pictures being made. I mean, you... -Excuse me. -What? What? -What's your name? -Jimmy Alto. Who are you? -Im Rob Weiss, the film's director. -The director. How are you, Rob? -How's it going? -We were just discussing over some roles that are available here. I wanna read him for Lewis. I think you'd be interested in this part of Lewis. Lewis? Who's Lewis? He's a principal? -He's a principal. -Now we're talking. See? I want to take... He's going to come with me. I want to do this. Do you have time to do this? Well, I just... You know, I have to run across town. I have another appointment with a director, but I can push that appointment off. I don't think you have any other appointments. -Its a little later, the appointment... -He's a lot like Lewis. Listen, I wanna take you with me. If you come with us to the end of the hall, maybe we can do some work. -Just take a couple of minutes. -Sure. No problem at all. Thanks for your help, sweetheart. You know, Rob, this girl has a bit of an attitude. I mean, she tried to dismiss me like I was some kind of an extra or something. Yeah, we'll take care of that ourselves. So, did you happen to see any of that S.O.S. stuff on the news last night? -The what? -The S.O.S. story with Jericho. I think you're going way over my head here. I don't know what you're talking about. Thought you said that Channel 5 was the number one news station, William? Jimmy, I want you to understand something here. All right, this is a very inexpensive film, so it's not really scripted. Well, there's not a script-script. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna improv a lot of it. -Its going to be real loose. -Hey, that's when Im at my best, when Im loose, when Im free, you know. Hey, you give me words, sometimes it pulls me down. You know what I mean? Listen, I have this guy outside I know who is going to play Tom. Okay, Im gonna bring him in here. What I want you guys to do is do some improv for me. -Hey, no problem. -So I get a feel, you know? Get really loose with him. Hey, it's a principal role. Of course. Stella! Loosening up my voice. Its all right. Get up now, you big tub of guts. Hey, the heads of the family, I want them all here. So, what do you want to do? You want to kill him? 'Cause Ill kill him. Ill kill him if that's what you want me to do. So, you want to kill him? What are you saying, I can't? 'Cause Ill kill him. Its just that you seemed a little ambivalent about it. You see something in these eyes that says Im ambivalent? Guess which one of your favorite actors got the second lead in Urban Nomad? -Really? -That's right. Jimmy Alto. Remember that name. Urban Nomad. Probably be out the beginning of next year sometime. -Is that my phone? -No. Hi, this is Jimmy Alto. Im on the set right now, so please leave a message or a fax for me. Thanks. Hi. This is Linda from Rob Weiss' office. We've been trying to get in touch with you. Unfortunately, we've had to go with our second choice for the role of Lewis. We're very sorry, Mr. Alto. Thank you again for coming in. The burden of battle. Stars like Al Jolson, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, and Marilyn Monroe. This is a traditional scene, a traditional thing for a star to do, for it was established long ago that when the nation went to war, Hollywood went, too. Its a shame. You know that? It all happened before I got here. This was the Mecca for dreams. This place used to sparkle. You could rub shoulders with movie stars walking along the boulevard. The glamour... Look at Hollywood now. No wonder I can't make it. Its over. Its over. You know something, William? Gotham had Batman. Hollywood needs the S.O.S. I just realized it. They need Jericho. We got to get some better television coverage, you know? Do you believe the police can't see this shit? Seems pretty amazing, doesn't it? We're going to just keep taping everything, send all the tapes to the TV station. Put it all on television. Let the people see just how fucked up all this is. Right in plain view. You remember that Medfly problem? It was a little tiny Medfly. They tracked it down, and they caught it in Hancock Park, and they can't find these drug dealers. But we're going to be the watchdogs, the guardians. Look what they've done to my Hollywood. Relax, William. What are you guys up to? l don't think that's any of your fucking business. Yes, it is, actually. My friends, they have a thing about being taped. Really? So, what do you suggest we do? l suggest you stop taping. Now give me the tape. Get away or Ill put a bullet through your fucking head. Oh, shit! He shot his own guy. William, you okay? William? Yeah, Im okay. This place is crazy. What, does everybody have a gun? What is it? I loved that car. You really didn't have much choice. If those guys talked, they finger the car, we're dead. Yeah, but I loved that car. We came to Hollywood together a long time ago. These drug dealers operate openly and freely in the Hollywood area. The wounding of one of the drug dealers occurred when he went up against two members of the S.O.S. force. Let this be a signal. Don't tread on us. We will never initiate aggressive action. But we will certainly return gunfire when deemed appropriate. I can't take this, Jimmy. I can't live this way. What? Don't you see how wrong this is? Don't you understand? Is there something wrong with you? Jericho. That's good. That's good. With William it's understandable. He doesn't know any better. At best, he's half there. Are you telling me that this is not effective? Its great acting. I mean, come on, Lorraine, look how believable this is. Jimmy, somebody was shot. You could have been killed. Dead! We're really not at liberty right now to talk about the specifics of the case. But we do have several leads. Yes. Oh, my God, Jimmy, they're gonna get you. They're gonna put you in prison. -...statement from Jericho... -Yes! Look at this! They're paying attention. They're all paying attention! Its a media blitz! It works. It works. Jericho works. Its a great role, Lorraine. -...Jericho warned other law breakers... -Its a great role. ...not to challenge them. Im gonna be at Janet's for a couple of days. I have to go. I can't even talk to you about this anymore. You can't talk to me? You can't talk to me? You're out of the Oscar speech! "Ride the RTD." Rapid Transit District, my ass. Six blocks, four hours. William! Come on. You're zoning. What are you doing over here? Now, you gotta blank out? What do you think? This is the place the guy brings the radios after he rips them off? "1149." Never forget a number. Yep. Nobody's making a living selling this shit. That's for sure. Hello, there, gentlemen. What can I do for you? I thought you might have some radios here. Radios? Yeah, you know, car radios. Well, what you see is what we got. Yeah, you got great merchandise here. It must just fly out of the door. Listen, I got a very good friend, says you got some car radios here. What's his name? He doesn't like people to mention his name. Well, I don't do business with strangers. -Hey, hey, hey! -Sorry, guys. Sorry, sorry. I thought there was a bathroom in here. Who the fuck are you? What are you, a cop? Its obvious they got stolen merchandise up the gazoo in the back of that place. What are you thinking about? You want to get your radio back? Is that what you're thinking about? I don't even have my car anymore. What the fuck would I want my radio for? So, then what are you thinking about? Im thinking the S.O.S. should torch that place. At least, Im sure that's what Jericho's thinking. Put that thieving ring out of business. -The big question is... -What? ...what do we do for transportation? Well, where do you wanna go? Maybe we could do a carjacking. What's a car jacket? -What? -Car jacket? Not a car jacket, a car jacking. They stick a gun in somebody's face and say, "Give me your car." And the people give them the car and they go. But we're not real thieves. Jericho came up to me and said S.O.S. needed my car for one of their missions. He said they would return it. And they did. With a full tank of gas and a very nice note thanking me. -You know what I like about you, William? -What? You're always right there, no questions asked. Right there. I need a gun. You get me a gun. We're going to burn down a building, you're there. Thank you, Jimmy. You know, there's an advantage to this memory lapse thing I have. I keep forgetting all the bad times. Well, I remember quite a few, enough for both of us. What? You were going to say something. I can tell. What? -New York. -What about it? You know, it's named after York. And then there's New Jersey. Its named after Jersey. And then there's New Zealand. Where is Zealand? Yeah. Where's Zealand? The fire began early this morning. Once again, it seems to be the work of the S.O.S. We received this tape from the S.O.S. Leader, Jericho. This store was a front for stolen items, from car radios to televisions and stereos, most of which were drug-related. The S.O.S. will not allow this operation to continue with business as usual. We're out there, the watchdogs of Hollywood. That's all for now. S.O.S. Save Our Streets. I just get better and better. I mean, I don't know. I hope it's not me, you know, Im not putting too much into it, but I get better and better. You want to get some breakfast? We just got through eating. No. Im only kidding. I know you blank all the time, so I took a shot. Ill be right back. Is this Janet's apartment? Yes, it is. -Is Lorraine here? -No. The two of them went to Big Bear for the weekend, I think. Im Holly, Janet's cousin. Im visiting from Hawaii for a while. Im Jimmy, Lorraine's friend. You want to come in for a minute? Sure. Yeah. Sure. I was just watching a piece on that S.O.S. group you got out here. -Pretty wild. -You think so? Oh, yeah. Everybody's talking about it. -Really? -Yeah. I had to go to market the other day, there were people at the register talking about it. And what do you think of the situation? I think it's a good idea. I mean, there's a lot of crime, and they're out there making a difference. Plus, they're not hurting the good people. Right. And what about this Jericho guy, their leader? What do you think of him? I think he's right. I think it's brave what he's doing. Do you? Yeah, well, Ive always been really into that kind of thing. You know, kind of underground stuff, sort of adventurous, you know? Yeah. -French resistance. -Im not familiar with them. I guess it's unimportant. Doesn't matter. Do you want something to drink? Yeah. You got any liquor here? Ill take a look. I don't know what she has. Yeah. Nothing with any pineapple. -So what do you do, Jimmy? -Im an actor. Can you imagine what it's like to be in some super police military thing? You know, he's like a Batman or something. That's right. That's right. Its very dangerous. Imagine putting your life on the line, not knowing if you're going to live or die. -This Jericho is some kind of guy. -Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, he must be a pretty extraordinary person. Special. I wonder if he's like a Bruce Wayne. You know, a wealthy guy that does that. Because you'd have to have some kind of money to train that whole group and arm them and everything. What if I told you that I know someone in the S.O.S., and that someone... Hello. Hi, honey. I miss you, too. Hold on a second. Im going to be on a while. That's okay. I forgot that I have an appointment. -Im going to run. -Okay. Hi, honey. No, I feel better. I might be able to walk down the street tonight. I think the S.O.S. is doing a really good job. Im a big fan of those Death Wish movies. Im sick and tired of being a hostage... If this is gonna get rid of some of the crime, I say, "Why not?" Its time the bad guys were victims. I wish I could join S.O.S. Im a young girl, Im single, Im in this town by myself. I don't feel safe. The only way you fight fire's with fire. The police could never intimidate them the way the S.O.S. can. And I am just... Im so happy to have Jericho here. Jericho. They love Jericho. ...that there's hope for the city now that they're here. The S.O.S. is apparently striking a favorable nerve in Hollywood. In an unofficial telephone survey conducted by this station, over 80%... Its a hit. Its a rave review. Its as good as a review if it was a show. Look at this. Another drive-by shooting. You know what's amazing, it's on Page 3 of the metro section. I mean, it's become so commonplace, it's on Page 3 of the metro section. Its ridiculous. It makes me sick. What do you want to do today? I don't know. What do you got in mind? I want to go see a movie. -I want to go see The Mummy -The Mummy? Will, don't start with The Mummy, okay? Its a little early. My father let me stay up and watch Fright Night. That's when I first saw it. You know what I couldn't figure out about the mummy? Its how he always used to walk with one arm behind him and a leg dragging. Will, Will, I know. Let me ask you a question. How come the only time you mention your father is with this Fright Night mummy thing? Don't you have any other memories? I remember he used to call me "useless." He did, huh? Well, let me tell you something. I was a salesman and I can size up people's characters pretty good, and you have a lot of potential. A lot of potential. Don't let anybody tell you different, ever. You just haven't clicked with the right thing yet, but when you do, boom! You're going to be on your way. Big things are going to happen for you. Trust me. A lot of potential. -Potential. -Right. -Who's this? -Steve. All right, all right. This time. Don't bring nobody else new, man. Stick up your hands, please. -Don't turn around. Don't turn around. -You want the money? -Take the money. -No, no, no. We don't want your money. -You don't want the money? -Yes, we do. Yes, we do. Its not cheap running a terrorist organization, here. Hey, he's got a gun! He's got a gun! -Give it up! -Get it! Get it! I got it! -Look this way. Look this way. -What are we gonna tie him with? What do you want to do with him? We can't take him to the police station. Its been done already. Why don't we just keep him captive like the Hezbollah? Hezbollah? Where could we put him? Can't keep him at my place. I guess I can keep him at my place for one day. I mean, it's safe. Lorraine's out of town, anyway. Come on, let's go. What the fuck was that you were listening to? Listen to me clearly. You have been sentenced to five years in an S.O.S. holding cell. -You will be chained to a bed. -Chained to the bed? I ain't with no freaky stuff man. Y'all just kill me right now. You saw the way the American hostages were treated? You will be treated in the same fashion, -as an enemy of the people. -Enemy of the people? I got a few character flaws, but I ain't no enemy of the people. I just like nice things. S.O.S. Save our souls. That's my parking. I miss you, Jimmy. I miss you, too. I hate myself for coming back, but what am I going to do? I don't want to be out of your Oscar speech. You're not going to be out of my Oscar speech. Wait, wait, wait. I have to go to the bathroom. He's gone crazy. Jimmy! -What? -Have you lost your mind? Listen. Let's go in the other room. I don't want him to hear anything. Okay, okay. What the hell is this guy doing in my bathtub, bound and gagged? -I didn't know you were coming home. -That explains it. There's a fantastic answer. See, what we're doing is, is kind of like a Hezbollah kind of thing. -You say Hezbollah? -Hezbollah, yeah. You know, the Lebanese stuff. -Yeah. -The terrorist group. -Yeah. -Yeah. The ones that take the hostages. See, I just didn't want to drop him off at the police station. A drug-dealing thing. I mean, we've already done that. So what we're doing is, we're setting up, like, an intimidation factor, you know? Hey, listen, do you know how many tourists visit Beirut a year? Do you? -No, no. -None. Zip. Nada. Do you know how many visit LA? Millions. And there's more killings in LA than there is in Beirut. There's more crime in Los Angeles than there is in Beirut, -and you know why? -No. Hezbollah, Hezbollah. They're scared shitless about that Hezbollah kind of stuff. That's why. What the hell are you talking about, Jimmy? What are you talking about? There is a man in my bathtub. Intimidating a criminal. That's what Im talking about. The police don't intimidate them. So, big deal, they get arrested. They do six months to a year. They go into the cells. They watch television. They do exercises. Big deal. The S.O.S., you know what we're going to do? The S.O.S. intimidates the criminal element. Tie him to a bed for five years. Scare the shit out of them. So, you want me to actually live in this house here with the hostages? Is that the next step, Jimmy? I get up a little earlier in the morning and feed the hostages. -Is that it? -No, no. This is a one-day thing. Im letting this guy go. I want him to go back into the community and spread the message. Intimidation. To think, a couple of days' work on a soap opera or something might have prevented this. Jimmy, where are we supposed to go from here? Well, listen, Im going to get rid of this scumbag right after dark, but I don't know what's going to happen from there. You're becoming another one of those media freaks, those people they keep making into celebrities. This is not about celebrityism. This is about the craft of acting. Its not a vigilante who's popular, it's an actor portraying a vigilante. The people believe Jericho. That's like the true tribute to my acting ability. Lorraine, look... I love you, but... Let me at least enjoy the fame a little. You stay down for five minutes. Otherwise, Ill be back. You got it? -Yeah, man. -Okay, man. This was supposed to have been Errol Flynn's house. Can you imagine overlooking Hollywood? Looking right down on it. Warner Brothers right over the hill. You finish Captain Blood, you come home, you got a nice living room, you sit down, the butler gives you the new script from the studio, go dancing at Ciro's, all those things. Imagine me coming home in the evening, Lorraine? We get ready to go out. You put on a gown, I put on a tuxedo. Dancing with the big dance bands. Going to some grand premiere at the Grauman's Chinese. Imagine if I was here back then? Id be as big as Cagney, as big as Edward G. Robinson. Id have been right there with them at Ciro's and the Brown Derby, schmoozing. "Hey, Eddie G., how you doing?" "Who's that? Oh, it's Jimmy Alto! Hey, Jimmy, how you doing?" "Sit down. You know Cagney." "Hey, how you doing?" Id have been right there with them. Rubbing shoulders with the best of them. But there's nothing there anymore. Its over. There's nothing down there now but a bunch of dead stars in cement. In Madrid, all I ever dream about was Hollywood. This is not the Hollywood I see in the movies. Its not. Salud. Hear that music? You don't hear that dance band? -Oh, yeah. -Let's dance. Do you have any idea why a black Range Rover was parked in your parking space last Friday, August 6th? No. In fact, I haven't even been back there a few days. -Do you have a car? -Yes. Well, why don't you park your car there? Because it's... Its a new one. I mean, I just picked it up today, as a matter of fact. So, until today, you didn't have a car? That's... Exactly. l had a car. I mean, it burned. It caught fire. -Burned? -Burned. Deader than a doornail. Remember that? No. The Postman Always Rings Twice. Johnny Garfield. Remember he said that to the cop? That's why I said it to you. You're a cop. I said to you. He said it to the cop. The cop said it to him. He said it back. "Deader than a doornail." Remember? Don't you remember in Body and Soul he said, "What are you going to do, kill me? Everybody dies." A lot of people say Im reminiscent of Garfield, too. Yeah, well, you're pretty good. Yeah. What you do, I guess you guys are good, too. Hey, who knows, maybe we'll work together again sometime. Bang, bang. Yeah. Well, they're obviously on to us. They must have a little bit more than they're making on to, you know? What do we do? What's the next step? I don't know. Im not sure. Ive never been in a spot like this before. Sure gets your adrenaline going, doesn't it? Gets you all pumped up? I feel like we're making some momentum now. I mean, they're snooping. We're moving. Id like to try something new, rather than just making statements all the time. A monologue, a soliloquy, some shit like that. Maybe I just got to reinvent myself a little bit. Reinvent yourself? How do you reinvent yourself? That's deep acting stuff. Its past Strasberg and... What's the Russian, the Russian... This Russian guy. -The other method... -Gretzky? Gretzky? That's hockey. Stanislavsky. That's it. Hockey. Gretzky. Its not your fault. You're not supposed to know anyway. Its my backyard. Im supposed to know. It just slipped my mind. The name slipped my mind. Stanislavsky. Yeah, it's deep. Worry about the camera. You worry about the camera. Just get that camera right when I nail it, 'cause I got them right now. I know I do. Fuck. I think those detectives are following me. Don't turn around. They're following me around now. So, I think the time has come. Yeah, what we're figuring is we're going to get out of town a little bit. All right, look, meet me at the Errol Flynn house at 8:30. Errol Flynn. Okay. Hey, William. You want a hot dog? Ill treat you. Let me have two dogs and a couple of lemonades. I don't want a... I don't want a lemonade. You don't want lemonade? No, no. My father, he gave me a lemonade when I was a little kid. He let me stay up and watch Fright Night. You know, this might be a good time to split up, Will. You and Lorraine? No, me and you. You see, if I get in the car and drive away, those cops will follow me. You can just walk away, home free. No. They'll never find you. No. I feel responsible. I mean Im the one that got us into this. You shouldn't have to go through this. I started the S.O.S. That's right. I forgot. You're the founder. You sure? Yeah, I want to stay with you. Thanks. Hey, where'd you go for those dogs, the ASPCA? Let's go. We got cops chasing us over here. Shake them up a little. They still there? These guys must know more than they're letting on. They must not have enough, though. They'd pull us over, right? Are you going to try and lose them? Yeah. We got to lose them. How do they lose those cops in all those fucking movies? They always lose them. Wait, fuck. We just did. We just lost them. They're at the light. They got caught in the light. If I was a cop, Id go through it. Fucking dopes. So this is for the best, don't you think? I could've been good for this town. I think I could've been a hell of an actor. It takes more than talent, Jimmy. Im sorry I didn't take you dancing to Ciro's. I would've liked to have seen you in a tuxedo, just once. It would've been fantastic. Its just a little too overwhelming. I don't know what I should do. Kiss you, hug you, or slap the shit out of you. I got to go. Go. I can't believe I didn't make it. I used to visualize the people back east saying, "Remember Jimmy Alto? We used to call him Jimmy Hollywood? "Went out to California and made it big." I just can't believe it. I really feel bad for Lorraine, you know. She had her heart set on the whole beauty salon thing. With my contacts, she could've became the first woman hairdresser to the stars. She could've been as big as Christophe or Jose Eber, I mean... She had a great name for it, too, don't you think? Lorraine De la Pena. Like Oscar De La Renta. At least Hollywood's going to remember Jericho. I just wish they knew that he was played by Jimmy Alto. -What do you make of this shit? -I don't know. Hey, you think this is that guy that got shot? I can't tell from here. I can't tell. What the fuck am I going to do here, William? There might be other guys, other lowlifes. I knew I should've worn my seat belt. Motherfuckers! These guys are playing games. I hate guys who give me the high beams. What the hell was that all about, huh? You think it was that drug guy we put in the bathtub? I don't know. I don't know. I mean, they obviously didn't know we were the S.O.S., right? Imagine if we were just average citizens and didn't know what to do. We could've got hurt. Why us? Out of the clear blue sky? It just goes to show you, I mean, you know, the craziness that's going on around here. Its crazy. I don't think we can leave town just yet. First Jimmy Alto's got to go public. Before I leave town, I go public. One last hurrah. You think that's a good idea? Yeah. I mean, if you're going to take a hit show off the air, you got to go out in style. You got to leave them with some kind of a hook. Reveal the identity of Jericho. Jimmy Alto is Jericho. You know, if Im going to make my farewell speech, Ill need an appropriate setting. Something, someplace that speaks Hollywood. The Hollywood Bowl, that's it. "Jimmy Alto at the Hollywood Bowl. One night only." What do you think? The Hollywood Bowl. I mean, look at this. This is great. What are you gonna do? You're going to find better than this? What the hell am I going to say? What am I going to say? You know, let's face it, Will. You know, we actually did some good. You know? I mean, that was not the purpose, but what the hell, huh? Crime is down. I forget how much, but it is down. Why was I going public? I can't even remember the reason now. You think it was those drug guys from the other time? I don't know. I don't know. Its hard to tell the lunatics from one another. I don't know. Its insanity. What do you want, motives? Its not like this is Murder She Wrote, William. I mean, there are no motives anymore. They could've just been playing games. I don't know who they were. I mean, it's total insanity. You want to make logic out of insanity? What am I gonna say here? Im trying to think. Is today the 17th? I don't know. Why? 'Cause I got my MRI appointment on the 17th, you know? That's wonderful, Will. We have police closing in on us, lowlifes smashing into the car, they shoot at us. And you're wondering about your doctor's appointment? You'll probably get a bullet in your fucking head before you get a chance to do your MRI. What am I going to say? What the hell am I gonna say? What a time not to know what to say. I mean, I have a chance to say it right here and be in everybody's living room, and I can't think of anything to say. Shit. Wait a minute. This is the 17th. Jimmy, this is the 17th! I got my appointment with the doctor for my MR thing today! William, we are leaving town! You understand that we are getting out of town? I know, but it's going to take forever to reschedule. Can't I just go do my MR thing right now, then we could both scoot out of town then? The sun's coming up. I want this speech to work at the appropriate moment, like Easter Sunday services, with that light just breaking through. What do you think? Are you sure? The vigilante Jericho has made his name known in the following videotape. Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood. This is Jimmy Alto, better known to you as Jericho. Its a very sad time for the S.O.S. The police are forcing us to leave town. Ill come back and pick you up. What do you think? A couple of hours? I don't know. It could be. l got the Sony Watchman and the Hollywood and the Stars tapes, Ill just watch that. Okay? They're in here. -Be careful. Don't lose my tapes. -I won't. Its just a matter of time before they get me, but think about this. Look at the time and energy the police are spending to find me and the members of the S.O.S. A task force. But are we a threat to the citizens of this city? No. Has the S.O.S. ever robbed or raped or killed citizens of this city? No. Is this same police energy directed towards the S.O.S. also applied to the criminal element of this city? No. People are afraid to go out at night for fear of being robbed or killed. Women are terrified to go into underground parking garages for fear of being attacked. We're guaranteed, in the Declaration of Independence, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No, the police just left. The shit's really going to hit the fan now. -What are you talking about? -Well, Ive gone public. I made a video saying that Jericho is really Jimmy Alto. No, don't tell me that. I can't talk now but Im bigger than ever. Ive gone public. Im defying them to come and get me. That's what my message is. Jimmy, listen to me. Listen to me. I can't. I can't. I got to run. The clock's ticking, honey. Ill call you when I get wherever it is Im going. Bye. Look what's happening to the quality of our life. What kind of liberty is it when the innocent people have to live behind bars to protect themselves? How can we pursue our happiness when we live in fear? l think we could sue the Government of the United States because our civil rights are being violated. This is a society that is being strangled to death by the criminal element. And what's being done? What is being done is they're trying to get Jericho. They're trying to get the S.O.S. He's very convincing. Yeah, he's a good actor, but he's not a vigilante. That's the problem. He's not a vigilante? No. Police Chief Cummings had this to say about the Jimmy Alto speech. I think this man Jimmy Alto is missing the point. The reason we're trying to get him as quickly as possible is we can't allow anarchy on our streets. Anarchy? You got anarchy up the ass, pal. Anarchy with cappuccino. We cannot sanction that type of behavior. What the hell's going on? At the present time, there are over 150 policemen assigned to track down Jimmy Alto and the S.O.S. Detectives on the special task force estimate there are and we believe them to be heavily armed and dangerous. Excuse me. I must be a mirage. Excuse me. Do you know where I might find William? William who? William. Little guy. Got a hat on. Head problems. He's here to see... He's getting an MRI. I must have a last name, sir. William, William. I don't know. Im sorry. I must have a last name. William! William? Aren't you Jimmy Alto? I just saw your Jericho speech on the television. Oh, yeah? l think it's a wonderful thing you're doing. -Thank you. -Id love to have your autograph. -I don't have a pen. -You're a hell of a guy, Jimmy Alto. l agree 1 00%. -What channel did you see it on? -PBS. Jimmy. Where the hell you been? Ive been looking all over for you. When? -What do you mean "when"? -I got you a root beer. Oh, shit. Look at this. Its really dark in here. Where'd you get that? The car radio guy. Let me see that. What the hell building is this? Looks like a pyramid, don't it? Those look like Egyptian hieroglyphics. Isn't that where they bury mummies? Don't worry, Will. He's not even in Philadelphia yet. What do we do now? I don't know. The best thing to do is to wait till dark and then we'll sneak out of here. Good afternoon. Breaking news in Hollywood. Hollywood police have surrounded the Egyptian theater... -Ten minutes. Ten minutes. -...where they apparently have cornered the man who calls himself Jericho, who we now know is Jimmy Alto... -Did you bring my Hollywood tapes? -Yeah. Get them out. The Egyptian theater has been derelict for some time, so it's conceivable it could be the S.O.S. Headquarters. We intend to cordon off the area and make sure the situation is contained. Do you think they could have explosives in there? ...and there's been absolutely no movement, but so far no shots have been fired. But we still don't know from police how many people there are inside... Police have the situation basically under control. Its basically wait and see. What will Jimmy Alto's next move be? As you can see from the number of police here... For the hopefuls who have flocked to Hollywood through the years, the studios were citadels to be conquered. Because there were so many who came hoping to succeed in pictures, the producers hid themselves from the onslaught behind their bars and walls. From the outside, the studios can seem as bleak and uninviting as fortresses. I think it takes a great deal to withhold and withstand the mad competition that you do have and to not give up, because it's very easy to give up. There are roles that you think you're just are on the verge of getting, and then it turns out they go to someone else. They still come, the young aspirants to Hollywood success. One sees them like moths fluttering in the glare of neon lights. Hollywood is a town in transition. Hollywood promises to become part of another supercity, like a lot of supercities in America. But the dream persists that there is still magic here. At night from a high building or hilltop, when the lights of the city are like beacons down below, the dream persists. Can the police estimate just how many members of the S.O.S. may be inside the theater at this point? Well, Hal, if they can, they're certainly not giving us any information about that. But judging from the manpower they have outside and the weapons they're carrying, they're ready to take on an army. Well, are they speculating, or could you perhaps speculate, on just how long this standoff can last, Paul? Are the police considering forcing their way into the building? Great documentary, huh? Great documentary. Think Im just gonna have a look around a little bit. Rather quickly, since earlier today, when this station received the latest S.O.S. videotape... -Jimmy. Jimmy! -What? You don't have to go take a look around. -What? -Its all right here. -What are you talking about? -There's, like, a million cops out there. Jimmy Alto, an unemployed actor who lives in Hollywood... Holy shit! All those people are out there? Yeah. So much for sneaking out inconspicuously tonight, huh? ...have secured the building. -We've also received word... -Yes! Look at this, Will. Fans. They're our fans. ...covering all possible exits from the theater. One thing I want to point out to you when you see it, all these people out here, it's like an old Hollywood premiere. They're a fan club. The police want Jericho, or Jimmy Alto, in custody. These people want to applaud him. In Hollywood, we have the hyphenate of actor/writer, producer/director. Well, now we have a new hyphenate, actor/vigilante. Jimmy Alto, we know him as Jericho... Well, there's still a tremendous amount of police activity here... Special weapons and tactics team continue to... I want to ask about this new information, that Jericho may actually be an actor. Well, as far as Im concerned, he's a vigilante. If he's an actor, he's playing on the wrong stage. We've managed to obtain a video of Jimmy Alto's taped audition... Look, look, look. They got your audition tape. -Apparently, he did not get the part. -Let me see that beauty. -They're showing it on television? -Let's take a look at that audition tape. What are you saying, I can't? Because Ill kill him. This one I did better in another scene. Why'd they put that take in there? -He's not dangerous. -Think you can get him out here? He's just an actor. Police have apparently persuaded Jimmy Alto's girlfriend, Lorraine De la Pena, to negotiate with Alto, in hopes of coaxing the S.O.S. leader -out of the theater peacefully. -Jimmy Alto! -Jimmy! This is the police. -Look here. You're looking up at the ceiling. We have Lorraine out here, out in front. She wants to talk to you. Id better get out there. Watch on this. Stay here, just in case. She is now walking up to the front doors of the theater... Hey, Lorraine. I think it would be good if we talked. Come on in. The show's about to begin. Look what happened? How the hell did you end up here? Well, William's MR took a little longer than we thought it would, and, I don't know, one thing led to another, and... Yes, one thing leads to another, but not to this. This building is surrounded. -Yeah? -Yeah. Its like an army out there. Hollywood Boulevard's really happening, huh? You have to come out. Hey, did you see they showed my audition tape -on television from Urban Nomad? -Yes. I thought it was pretty good. What'd you think? Yes, Jimmy. Very good. You know, they used to show classic movies in this place. Let's get William, and we'll go out together. Okay? Im not going to give up, Lorraine. Not now. This is the greatest role of my life. You've got to know how crazy this is. Jimmy, they will kill you. They ready. Ill never get another role as good as Jericho. Nothing this good. You never know. I do know. Im a one-role actor. Brando... He's an actor. Stanley Kowalski, Street car Named Desire. Terry Malloy, On the Waterfront. The Godfather. I don't have that in me. Think of it this way, Jimmy. Look at all the attention you're getting. And the charges against you probably won't be that great. You'll be out in a couple of years, and you'll be acting for sure. This is the role. Im going to play it out. You've played it out, Jimmy. Its over. No, it's not over. Every great role has a great ending. I am not going to cheat that. l want you to take William out with you. -William! -Yeah. Come here. -What happened? -I want you to do me a favor. Lorraine, we saw you on the little TV here. You looked good. You look very photogenic. Will, I want you to leave with Lorraine. You think that's a good idea? Yeah, I do. I want you to leave. Okay. Whatever happened to those big romantic Hollywood endings? I don't know. -Will, you got to leave me these guns. -Okay. I need this. This, too. Hey. Hey, it's okay. The mummy's going to stay with me. You're safe. Okay? Okay. Hey, Jimmy, can you see me? Im on TV! We're not sure, though, who the man is, apparently one of the members of the S.O.S. There appears to be some sort of negotiation taking place. They're apparently getting demands from someone inside the Egyptian theater. Apparently, Jimmy Alto came out to Los Angeles from the New Jersey area about seven years ago. He was an aluminum siding salesman, as well as being involved in kitchen remodeling, but decided that acting was his calling in life. Its a very interesting situation because he's acting out this part. And we're not exactly sure how it's going to end because he's writing the script. Its in his hands at this point. What are you going to do, kill me? Everybody dies. What are you going to do, kill me? Everybody dies. What are you going to do, kill me? Everybody dies. Fuck! What are you going to do, kill me? Fuck! Kill me? Shit! What are you going to do... What are you going to do, kill me? Everybody dies. Fuck! What are you going to do, kill me? Everybody dies. Everybody dies. Everybody dies. Everybody dies. Everybody dies. Everybody dies. Im coming out! Keep your hands above your head in plain sight and walk. I don't have any guns. See? Nothing in the front of me. Nothing in the back of me. Take him down! Jericho is dead. Perhaps the most infamous vigilante this country has ever known... And a mighty fine actor, I might add. I was just a lost kid on the boulevard until Jimmy saved me. He truly is a genius, what else can you say? He's a genius. He's a genius in a town that doesn't embrace geniuses. To you, you may have killed a vigilante, but for me, you kill the love of my life. You may have cut short potentially one of the great acting talents of all time. I think we can all mourn that loss. Jericho! Jericho! Jericho! What are they going to do, kill me? Everybody dies. Im coming out! Keep your hands above your head in plain sight and walk. I don't have any guns. See? Nothing in the front of me, nothing in the back... -Everybody down! -Gun shield! Who was that, James Cagney? I had to tell them. I forgot I told you I had blanks. Some vigilante, huh? Think of it this way. In Hollywood, they always use blanks. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Blanks. Hollywood. We now go to Paul Jackson outside the Egyptian theater. Paul, has Jimmy Alto ever worked as an actor out here? Well, Hal, we've done some checking. We've found no information to indicate Alto's ever worked as an actor here. No motion pictures, no television shows, nothing at all. What about commercials? How about industrial films, for example? No commercials, no industrial films, no movies, no television shows. We've checked the gamut and we've found no information that he's ever acted, Hal. Bye, Jimmy. Jimmy, we love you! I could never have appreciated this if I was dead. Beautiful work. Wow! Beautiful. Steve McQueen. Clint Eastwood. Even James Cagney. None of them could have done any better. I don't think so. None of them. Is this a principal role? I mean, 'cause I came here for a principal role. -They said it was a principal role. -No. This is what we're casting. Just two lines? Im not doing two lines. I didn't come here for two lines. -I was told it was a principal role. -This is what we're casting today. Now, wait a second. Im... You know, is the casting director here -or somebody else I can talk to... -Im sorry. This is bullshit. All right. Cut, cut! Okay, everybody, take five. Jimmy you're not suppose to speak during a take. Yeah, but... Im sorry. This is nonsense. I don't believe this. I don't buy it for a minute. What is this guy, dreaming or what? -I can't have talking on the set, Jimmy. -Im sorry. He got excited. Its his life. Yeah. Yeah. Its okay. Yeah, but his life didn't happen like that. That's not what was going... Im sorry. Sorry. Well, what's the problem? Harrison, let me deal with this. No, no. Let him talk. Go ahead. Hope you don't mind. I don't mean to step on your toes or anything, Mr. DeMille. You see, Harrison, when I came into this casting office, let me tell you what I was thinking, let me tell you what I was feeling. I believed I was entitled to the principal role. All right, William, let me see the playback. I knew that I was made for that. You see, I wasn't going to waste my time doing these two piddly little lines. I had confidence. -Yeah, I understand. -I wasn't begging them for the part. No. I felt in my soul that the principal role was for me. -Okay. -I knew what I could do.
