Thank you. Come, girls, we have to go. - Bye, sweethearts. - Bye, daddy. Schneider speaking. - Happy birthday. - Yes, thanks. - Have the girls sung for you yet? - Yes. Listen, there's a problem. I knew it. You wouldn't call me just for my birthday. It's urgent. - I'm not available today. - It has to happen today. Ask Kraus then. He's also very good. Kraus is abroad. 9 o'clock. Be there. Are you still there? - Yes, I'm still there. - Nine o'clock. - Do you have to leave? - Mertens called. It's urgent. - You were going to help me. - I know. - Do you know how long you'll be? - No. Karin cancelled. - I don't mind that. - Me neither. I'll be back as fast as I can. - Can't we do it tomorrow? - No. - Is it that important? - Yes. What's it about? Ramon Bax, an author. He's here, at the lake. In a wooden cottage. He's on his own. - Approach the house from the front. - Why can't I do it tomorrow? - Tomorrow, he'll be gone. - I have to help Lucy with a dinner. - You should be home before noon. - I'm not doing it. It's Tuesday, a good day for a job. What does Tuesday have to do with it? Tuesday is a lucky day. Didn't you know? I'm not doing it. Schneider, it's important. It's not payback. It's to prevent worse. Ramon Bax is a child-killer. Ramon. Little Ramon... Your breakfast is ready. - What day is it today? - Tuesday. What time is it? Quarter to ten. - Shit! - What is it? Sorry, darling. Have a shower and get dressed. Then you'll have to go. - Go? - My daughter's coming. She can't see you here. - And you tell me that now? - I forgot. That can happen. Nadine! Nadine! How clean do you want to be? - I'm sad. - Sad? Why? - I thought we were serious. - We are. - Prove it. - How? - Introduce me to your daughter. - Not today. - You're ashamed of me. - No, but my daughter's strange. Who's more important, your daughter or me? You, of course. But my daughter and I have a history. Delete that history then. Like you do after you've watched porn. Get dressed. - Suddenly, I'm no longer important? - At ten, you'll be gone. 1... 2... How do I get home? Asshole! Do you know more? I'm at the pumping-station. It's completely blocked. I'm waiting for the technicians. - So it could take long. - Yes, don't count on me, sorry. - Don't worry about me. - See you later. Bye, darling. Francisca. - Have you been here long? - Fifteen minutes. The front door was locked. - You should have called. - I did, you were wearing headphones. - How are you? - Fine. - And you? - Fine. - Has it been a year? - Just about. - Cup of tea? - Yes, of course. Where are you? Why do you call me? That's very unusual. - Where are you? - On my way. How far from the target? No idea. I'm on the other side of the lake, in the reeds. Let me know when you have visual of the house. Mum says you're writing. That's true. - Are you writing a novel? - Yes. - What about? - The same as all novels. Fate, love... - Who was your visitor? - Why? I had a meeting. - With whom? - An editor. - An editor? - Yes, an editor. - An editor in a skirt? - Yes. - With coke and weed, apparently. - Yes, to add to the fun. Still? Do you still need that? Stop it, Francisca. Sometimes I take coke or smoke a joint. You eat muesli. I don't comment on that. - Muesli's good for you. - I don't think so. Muesli depresses me. Muesli's for goats. - Shall we stop this, daddy? - We? You started this. You haven't been here for ten minutes and you're already checking up on me. - What are you doing here? - I'm a bird-watcher. You're not allowed to be here. This is a restricted area. - Is the white van yours? - Yes. If you follow the road, you'll reach the unrestricted zone. I've never seen you here. I've never been here before. And? He said he was alone. But he's with a crying woman. A crying woman? Yes, a woman who's crying. - Young or old? - What do I care? You don't inform me well. You didn't tell me this was a protected area. A protected area? Does it make a difference? I was kicked out by a ranger. - Is that a problem? - I have to start all over again. What do you mean, all over? I'm in disguise and they've seen me with this disguise. In disguise? You're disguised? Yes, disguised. Are you going to pretend you didn't know? I always wear a disguise for this kind of job. - You're disguised as what? - As someone else. And I assume that the ranger wrote down my license number. So I need another disguise and another car. That means my own car! This really sucks, Mertens! Don't call me anymore! I'll do this, my way! But the woman has to go. Otherwise I won't do anything. Damn it! I'm emotional, daddy. Everything went wrong, last year. Everything I wanted failed. Have you spoken to Cato yet? To Cato? What do I need Cato for? - First of all, she's your sister. - What do I want Cato for? She gets everything she wants without doing anything for it. That's why you should talk to her. You're rigid. You plan everything. Cato goes with the flow. That's the secret, sweetheart. - Why do you bring up Cato? - I told you. Cato can help. But Cato isn't here, is she? You are. You have to help me. You're my father. You're not being clear, girlie. You don't say what you want. Suddenly, you're fucking with me. Is it strange that I get mad? Is it strange? That's my question. How often did I hit you all in all? Twenty times? Let's say twenty-five. Over a period of two years. Is that so bad? But what did you get in exchange? We don't talk about that. I pulled you out of the shit. Out of 100% pure shit. Don't be afraid. I want you to show yourself and I don't want you to scream... ...and I don't want you to cry, but I want you to say: "Sorry, Bolek." Go. I'll take your hand, I'll give you a kiss and then we'll go. Go to him, kiss him and leave this building. I'm not going to look for you, Gina. - He'll hurt me. - I don't think so. If you don't show yourself, I'll leave. If he'll try anything, I'll step in. - He's armed. - Forever, baby! Go. Come in my arms, Gina. Ah, there you are. Are you going to stay there? - What will you do? - What I promised. I'll give you a kiss. - I don't know, Bolek. - I give you a chance to make amends. Come on, baby. I have more things to do today. Light punishment is appropriate, don't you think? This is all very inconvenient, did you know that? - Why did you run in here? - I was able to open this door. Who's the asshole? - A friend. - You mean a pimp. - What were you two doing in this area? - Nothing. - I don't even know which city this is. - Where did you come from? - From Culemborg. - That's an hour's drive. So you spent an hour in a car without knowing where you were going? He went to see a business contact. I just kept him company. You just kept him company? We had an argument. I got out of the car at a traffic light. Where is that car? Why don't you smoke a joint? That'll calm you down. - It's like medication. - I need a bit more to feel better. I understand, but if you want to feel better, you'll first have to calm down. Hashish makes me paranoid. It's just a light, friendly weed. No thanks, dad. I'll try two more things. Mogadon, a sedative. No. It's a sleeping pill. It makes you fat. Do you want me to get fat? - Rohypnol then. - That's also a sleeping pill. - Did I come here to sleep? - Why not? A nap will do you good. - I'm trying to help you. - With drugs! - Is that all you have to offer? - A bowl of muesli then? - Are you making fun of me? - Yes, definitely. You don't want to be helped. You're quite happy to be in the shit. Come on, Francisca. I care about you, but I'm not a psychiatrist. You don't ask anything. You don't want to know. You're not interested in me. I'm a burden because you have to work on your book. Not at all, but I had imagined this day very differently. I was expecting a daughter who was doing well, but I got a sad daughter. How can you expect a daughter who's doing well? You know me. Life doesn't work out for me. - Never? - Almost never. I don't know how to do it, daddy. How to do what? Live. - That's why you have to talk to Cato. - You piss me off with your Cato. Cato's in Egypt. - Start by calming down... - You calm me down then. You don't want it. I suggest all kinds of things. Damn it! You used to console me by telling me a story. Do you remember Edward the Gnome? Yes, I remember. Edward only had one leg, but he was happy nevertheless. - You should take a page from his book. - You can't help yourself, can you? Tell me, daddy. About Edward the Gnome. - Right now? - Yes. That will make me happy. But I don't remember. It's been so long. Where did Edward the Gnome live again? In the dunes. Tell me a story, daddy. - Hello? - Are you talking to someone else? Francisca, it's important. No, you're talking to me now. Get lost! I won't be long. We'll continue in a moment. One moment, I'm stepping out. Thank you for your great story! What is it? - I'm coming to get my things. - Impossible. I'll bring them tomorrow. You don't have a say in the matter. You'll see me when you'll see me. Didn't you hear? My daughter's here. She's having a nervous breakdown. I won't come alone. I'll bring Jules. Jules? - Who's Jules? - Someone who can kill you with one thumb. - I don't want to die. - You won't die, you'll fall asleep. - When you'll wake up, you won't remember. - I want to stay awake. - You're an obstacle. - I want to go home. - Do you want meat or fish tonight? - Fish. - How is it going? - Not too well. I'll spare you the details, but I'll be here for a while. I'm not worried. If you don't worry either, everything will be alright. - Are you worried? - No, not at all. - Bye, darling. - Bye, sweetheart. Francisca? - Let's sit outside. - No. This doesn't make any sense. Come out. No. This room's big enough for me. I have good medication. Take some. Don't just think of yourself. Who's only thinking of himself here? You want a dopey fat daughter so you can write your book. I want us to have a good time together. Smoking joints and boozing on the jetty, you mean. Bax. There's a woman with you. Yes, my daughter. What is it to you? Have you got a screw loose? He's coming! He's on the way! - Who's on the way? - Who do you think? Are you saying Schneider's on the way? Yes. - Wasn't it for next week? - Today, Tuesday. Shit! - Have you been smoking joints again? - My daughter's depressed. - Your daughter has to go, you hear? - Can't you call Schneider back? - We'll do it tomorrow. - Out of the question. How much time do I have? I don't know. 45 minutes, 30 minutes? Do you hear me? What? - Do you understand? - Yes. I'll keep you informed about his position. Damn it. Francisca? Francisca? Francisca? I'm not giving any information anymore. I can't work like this. - I'll let you know when it's finished. - Shut up! What do you think I'm doing? You're annoying me. If you keep me informed about your position, I can lead Bax towards you. - I don't need your help. - Didn't you want to go home early? Yes, but not at the expense of my own safety. Of course not. Listen to me. Do you want to know or not? I'm listening. I know Bax personally. I can call him without raising suspicion. There are a lot of reeds opposite his front door. You can position yourself there. I'll call Bax and make him go outside. You'll only have to pull the trigger. Are you still there? - It sounds too easy. - Good ideas always sound easy. I want it to work, understood? I don't know, Mertens. What do you have against it? Do we agree or not? Yes. - Make sure the crying woman leaves. - That's his daughter. All the more reason. She has to leave. See to it. If I see that woman, I won't do anything. I'll look after it. Where are you now? Near St. Peter's Church. You'll hear from me. Francisca? I don't have any more time, Francisca! Damn it, stupid woman. It's becoming very dangerous here, don't you understand? Where are you? I have problems with my daughter. - Is she gone? - Yes, she's gone. Where's Schneider? Ten minutes ago, he was near St. Peter's Church. Time's running out. Are you clear-headed? Do you hear me? Mertens, are you still there? - I'm here. And you? - Yes, I'm here. - Are you clear-headed? - Yes. Listen to me. I told Schneider that I'll make you go outside through the front door. He'll position himself in sight of the front door. - I know enough. - One more thing. - He'll be disguised. - As what? No idea. Be careful. He's smart. Why does he have to die exactly? He's a child-killer. The crying woman left. Where are you? Near the water tower. He's near the water tower. Scumbag! I knew it! Sent to SCHNEIDER Hello, Ramon. What are you doing here? I'm here to see you, to introduce my little friend, to say hi to Francisca. - Did you bring your mobile phone? - Yes. Give it to me. Don't you give your father a hug? Your timing's bad. I'm in a dangerous situation. No questions, do as I say. I want you to close the curtains. - Why do they have to be closed? - Do it or I'll slap you. Maybe we'd better leave, Gerard. - Where's Francisca? - She's hiding in the swamp. The swamp? Which swamp? Bax speaking. - What's keeping Schneider? - Why can't I reach you? My mobile's not working. Where's Schneider? Listen and don't interrupt me. Something's gone wrong. Schneider knows you're expecting him. I sent him a text message that was meant for you, by mistake. What? You heard me. It's very stupid, I know. What text message? "He's near the water tower." Jesus, you're an idiot. - You'll have to get him. I'll pay double. - Double? Triple! Schneider's become very dangerous now! Triple. Yes or no? Yes. Daddy! Help! Francisca needs help. Go get her. There's no danger. She stays here. - I don't want to stay here. - One moment, sweetie. - I have to go into the swamp at my age? - It's an emergency. - Why don't you do it? You're her father. - Quiet, girl. What's happening exactly? - You're sending me into the swamp? - Yes. Damn it, get up! A bit of speed? I want speed too. - Is that speed? - Yes, that's speed. You'll enter the reeds here. You'll see a ditch. On the other side, there are more reeds. Behind them is the swamp. - Can I get my mobile back? - No. Have you got the car keys? Car keys. And keep your hands to yourself. Don't touch her. If you touch her, I'll kill you. There's a girl in the bedroom. Who is it? No idea. I thought you only came to get your own things. Are you Jules? - Yes. - You can kill me with one thumb? Yes or no? Yes. Francisca! It's grandpa! I'm coming to get you. You're so beautiful when you look sad. What are you doing here? I'm coming to get you. Your father wants you to come home. I'm staying here. Do you want me to console you a bit? I don't need to be consoled. Aren't you depressed? I'll just caress your knee. There's no harm in that, is there? Don't. - You're staying here. - What did you take? You look insane. - You're staying here. - Damn it! Are you retarded? Jules needs to go to hospital. Where's grandad? What happened? Did that bastard touch you? - Where is he? - Why did you send grandad after me? Did you want to punish me or something? I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry. I'm sorry? I stabbed him. - Dead or wounded? - Dead. It's alright. - Where did you put him? - In the swamp. It's alright, sweetheart. Grandad's an asshole. Listen did you hide him well? Where it's very deep? Calm down. I can't calm down, daddy! How can I continue to live? I'm going to give you something. Here. - What is it? - It's innocent stuff, really. Now lay down. I can't lay down. I have to sit. Sit and stay calm then. I have to go somewhere. I'll be right back. You have to leave. - Where's Gerard? - He'll come later. - I have to wait for Gerard. - Be quiet. Who are you? I'm Francisca. If you're Francisca, where's Gerard? He drowned in the swamp. So what? Are you going to cry now? Why do you need a gun? - There's a man who wants to liquidate me. - Why? No idea. You have no idea, but you do have a gun? Tell me what's going on. It can't be that hard, can it? You have to leave. You can't do anything for me. - Do you think I can't handle this? - I don't think anything. Just leave. - I'm staying here. - Take grandad's car and go. I'm not leaving. Daddy, I can help, really. He won't hurt me. I'll read a book outside. Do you understand? That way, he'll have to go to the other side, where you will be. You have no idea. Do you think I'll let my daughter be shot dead? - I don't feel well. - Are you surprised? With all the junk you're taking. - I need some speed. It takes it away. - Takes what away? I have to become strong and smart again. Schneider's also smart. Schneider? Is that his name? Yes, that's his name. According to Mertens. Who's Mertens? The man from the deep south who rides a billy goat at night. - Do you have speed? - Yes, I do. Please take some then. Jesus, what is all this? This must be it. Are you sure? Yes. Here. And eat something. No bread. I only eat crackers. There are no crackers. - Did you look in the kitchen cupboard? - Yes. Don't get up. There are no crackers. You don't know where to look. No crackers. The number you're trying to reach may be turned off. Please try again later. You're not allowed to be here, Madam. - Why not? - This is a restricted area. If you... Damn! Can I go home? It's here. Go left at the container. Give me your foot. - What? - Give me your foot. - Why? - Give me your foot, I said. - What is this? - An explosive, so you don't run away. I'm giving you ten minutes and if you're not back by then... - ...I'll press the button. - Are you serious? - You bet. - Are you crazy? I'll come back. I'm not taking any risk. I won't be betrayed by a whore from Culemborg. - What happens if you press the button? - You'll lose your leg. Come on, get out! What if I'm late and it's not my fault? Tough luck for you. Get out! And don't forget you don't know me. You've gone for a walk and you're thirsty. All you have to do is make sure she leaves, understood? Otherwise she's dead. Your time starts now. Could I get a glass of water? Of course. I'll get it. Where are you? Under the bed. - What's going on, daddy? - It'll go away. What did she want? A glass of water. You're in danger. - What did you say? - You're in danger. You have to leave. - Who are you? - You have to go. - I'm not in the mood for this. - If you stay, you'll die. Is this a joke? It's a message. From whom? - Schneider sent you. - You have to leave or you'll die. Thanks for the water. Do you think I'm an idiot? Why is all this necessary? Can't this Schneider just go home? - I have to go. - What did my father do? - I don't know. - Please, can't we talk about it? I only have one thing to say: you're in danger. Go away. - I can't abandon my father. - I've said it. Now I have to go. Will Schneider come and save you if I take you hostage? I don't know any Schneider. Damn it, Schneider won't come and save me. Look at my ankle. What is that? I have two minutes left. Then he'll blow me up. It's not going well at all, daddy. Come. I've tried my best. - She's not going. - No. Can that thing go? Here, sugar water. Drink it. Eat it. Eat. - Eat it. - Can you calm down? Calm down? We're in a hurry, daddy. Eat! I don't know if you remember, but there was a woman here. Remember? - Yes. - Yes? She'd been sent by Schneider and she had to convince me to leave. I stayed as you can see. - I can't keep that down. - Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes. Why does Schneider want you dead? Daddy, if you don't answer me, I'm leaving. - It's not interesting. - Bullshit, answer me! It's a trap. I have to liquidate him. Mertens was supposed to send Schneider to me, but something went wrong. Now he knows I'm expecting him. You're a hitman? You kill people for money? I need alcohol. Let's drink alcohol together, so we'll have fun at least. Fun? You have to become clear-headed and take control. Damn it, don't you understand the situation we're in? - What are you going to do? - Puke. Do you feel better? In the boat. Sit down! Listen, you're less than a pile of shit to me. But I'll give you a chance. You'll go on the lake. Bax will think you're me. You'll have two bullets to kill Bax. And don't think you can run away. I'll keep you within range... ...and I'll shoot a bullet through your head at the slightest suspect movement. If you kill Bax, you're free to go. - I won't stand a chance. - I don't think so either. Daddy! Is it him? I'm not sure. - I'm not sure. - Shoot the boat first. It's not Schneider. Stay down. Let the daughter live. That's impossible. She's a witness. If I let her go, I'm fucked. I have two young children. You could at least think about it. - Who was it? - Mertens. The man from the deep south who rides a billy goat at night? What are you talking about? Mertens is the client. - The client's dead so we're going. - No, you're wrong. Schneider wants both of us dead. Today or tomorrow. I don't think so. Mertens is a traitor and he has been punished. Schneider and me, we're colleagues. We don't have an old score to settle. Schneider just shot at me. He wants to clean up and go home. - Car keys? - I don't have them. Jesus! - You stay here. - You could also decide not to do it. Think for a moment. You're not an ape, are you? Jesus, Gina... damn it! What are you doing here? I'll lift you up. - You can't. - If we're fast, we'll be alright. Leave me here, Schneider. Please. I'm almost finished. Problems with a centrifugal pump. There are always problems with these things. The girls want to say hello. - Say hello to daddy. - Hello, daddy! - Hello, darlings. - We're blowing up balloons. Very good. See you in a bit. Bye, dear daddy! Do you think you'll be on time? - What time are they arriving? - In an hour. I should be able to make that. Alright, see you then. See you then.
