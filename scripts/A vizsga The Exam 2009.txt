Due to the above, the full appraisal of all personnel is required as well as a reduction in staff numbers, which must be completed no later than December31, 1957.

The buses will run until 6 pm from Wednesday. Drinking is allowed but only at home. Why is there so little soap and washing powder? Thousands queue for cigarettes. Will there be unemployment? When will the no. 6 tram start again? A year has passed since then and people are once again preparing for Christmas... Comrade Jung. You didn't come to the residents meeting. Is there a problem with my students? Are they upsetting the residents? I wanted to invite you over for fish soup tonight. I make it spicy. I'm sorry but I'm working. On Christmas Eve?! That's right. Happy holidays, Mrs. Egri. Happy holidays. But the festivities are not only for the children. Our shops have plenty of gifts for older shoppers... - Comrade Jung? - Can I help you? I'd like to study German. I'm sorry but I'm too busy. - They recommended you. - I can't take any more students. - I'll pay well. - I'm sorry but I still can't. How did you hear about me? From the newspaper. I don't advertise. Then it must have been from a friend. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Happy Christmas! - Happy Christmas, Comrade Jung! We have messages from refugee Hungarians for their families back at home. And now for the messages... The first is in code and it goes like this: "Come sweetheart, come!" This goes to Miskolc and from Uszu to the two old girls, who says all is well in England. Pter wants the lame cook in Sifok to know that he is well and in America. To no. 25 in Tatabnya, Bilux says he's in England. Tomi wants Nandin to know that Panci has arrived at the in-laws. December 24, 1957. Relax! I bought the books like they told me. Grammar book, dictionary, another dictionary, work book... Do you know who I am? The German teacher. And do you know what you have to do? Learn German, no? Only joking. Do you live here? I thought it would be some ministry building but then I saw it's an apartment building... This is an undercover apartment, Comrade Radnai. We rent it so that we can meet in relaxed circumstances. It obviously wouldn't be good if your colleagues saw you walking into a ministry building. Obviously. What would they think? They wouldn't think I was having German lessons. When were you recruited? November 22. Avery convincing comrade. For patriotic reasons? Have I seen any of your films? The last one was a Szilvsi adaptation with Ruttkai... I can see that you haven't had the chance to travel abroad. That must irritate you... I won an award in Locarno and I couldn't accept it in person. Do you hope it will be different now? Do you hope you'll be able to take revenge on a few of your colleagues? Because if you do, you're in the wrong place. I hope that the time will come when I can concentrate solely on my films. Your code name will be Pudovkin. You'll type your reports under that name and bring them to me once a week and I will forward them to the ministry. Couldn't it be Fellini? Fellini is already taken. Did the convincing comrade teach you how to write a report? In the third person singular, one copy and to differentiate between the conscious enemy and the mistaken. Excellent! Hands up! You idiot! Happy Christmas! Reports from week 50. My timetable for week 51. "11 am - Flea, 12- Priest." This is London calling. Good morning ladies and gentlemen... "5 pm - supper with the Marks." Janka's gone to a lot of trouble. You busy? I've got a stack of reports to write. - And I've got to refresh the agent list... - Andris, you can refresh it another time. It's Christmas! - and don't be late! - I'll be there. Oh, I nearly forgot this. Janka sent it. Thanks. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Happy Christmas, Dad! They reckon they found it at a dog pound somewhere in Moscow. What breed? Some kind of mongrel. It's got two big ears and a spotty face... About this big. And is it up there all alone? Yeah. In orbit. I don't envy it. Good morning, Comrade Lieutenant-Colonel. Could you be more obvious? "5 pm-supper with the Marks." Janka's gone to a lot of trouble. You busy? I've got a stack of reports to write. - And I've got to refresh the agent list... - Andris, you can refresh it another time. It's Christmas! Comrade Jung, I'm sorry, I hurried. My mother isn't well. I'll start right away. - Sound? - Working. In accordance with order no. 16, 1957 issued by the Ministry of the Interior of the Peoples' Republic of Hungary, we will now commence secret agent Andrs Jung's test. Present are Pl Mark -test officer, Ferenc Dohny-technician and... Emil Kulcsr. Emil Kulcsr. Emil Kulcsr. - Emil? - Emil. Emil Kulcsr invigilator. Let's start. ...noodle soup, turkey with boiled potatoes, mashed potatoes, rice, pickles and cucumber salad. Everyone ate the soup except Patai. Tbis... ordered boiled potatoes, Patai and Molnrhad rice, Fekete mash. They all ate salad. The turkey was very tasty and they served it with little mushrooms. The dessert was... Who's the gourmet? Codename Flea. A literary foot soldier. He's reporting on the Patai circle. And the one at 9 o'clock? The director? Do you want me to rewind? Later. ...and was there for 5 minutes. I don't know if he met anyone in there but his hands were wet when he came back. Patai and Molnr went out for a cigarette after the main course and I didn't hear their conversation. They smiled when they came in and slapped each other on the back. There was no mention of politics at the table. We talked about the food and the weather and Molnr made one mention... ...of the female genitalia. PRIES There's no point you protecting Father Lupics! But he is a priest! That means nothing... Comrade Jung! It's like... ...me asking you to betray a fellow officer. - Would you do it? - We have an agreement, Father. There's no need to remind me. We're understanding of your invalid mother... Comrade Jung, I'm on your side. I sometimes have my doubts. Because I don't understand why you are interested in the private life of a village priest. There must be more important things. Father Lupics is no counter-revolutionary. - He's never seen a gun in his life. - Father, the counter-revolution isn't only fought with guns. The bishop's left. Anyone else? No. Shall we go? May I remind you that it's only 1 o'clock? I agree. The rules state that surveillance should last at least 12 hours. Who do you think wrote those rules? Sorry, Comrade Mark, but it's still a rule... Someone's coming. Is there no one waiting for you at home? It's a woman. Who is she? An agent? I've got no idea. These are all Jung's female agents. She isn't one of them. I didn't touch a thing. Cake? They've plum jam in them. You're an angel. Nice? What's this? A double season ticket to the National Theatre for 1958. You'll have to go with me now. Thanks. I know we said you'd sleep here tonight but something's come up. Are you throwing me out? No. It's just that... I've got work to do. - On Christmas Eve? - I'm sorry. Where are you going? If you're busy, I'll find someone to spend Christmas with! Don't do this, va! I'll walk up to someone on the street! No, no, wait! Wait, do you hear? va! This is the last time. I promise. - Have you got kids? A wife? - No! va, no! Trust me! I love you! You're a fool! This is Radio Free Europe, the voice of free Hungary... The girl's leaving. Tell Varga to follow her. I'm going. - Csap. - This is Jung. - Can we talk now? - Have you got what I asked for? - Yes. - How many? Just one. - Is she on it? - She's on it... And? It's pretty... surprising. Put it in an envelope and take it to the arranged place. I'll pick it up in an hour. Okay. Who was that? I don't know. Wind it back. - Csap. - This is Jung. No, to the dialling. - Can I borrow that? - Of course... - Sorry! - I'll get it. Stop. Sorry. And a pencil. Here. And again. Stop. teacher at the Music Academy. - Is that who Jung called? - Does he work for us? Codename Music Man. Failed attempt to defect. He reports on Szabolcsi. Tell me the address. Comrade Mark, can I come, too? - What did you say your name is? - Kulcsr. Emil Kulcsr. You're driving. Any news? Varga called. He followed the woman on the bus to Blaha Square. She went into a building there. He's waiting for orders. - Should I drive? - I've got a chauffeur. I'll call you. - Who's the woman, Comrade Mark? - Drive. - Did you know about Jung's affair? - Keep your eyes on the road. According to the rules personal visitors... are not allowed in undercover apartments... without prior permission. Are you raising your daughter on your own? I saw the drawing. - She's called Panni. - Is she in hospital? You got this from the drawing? From your face. Tense. Nervy. I'm always like this. I'm a nervy type... - Turn. - Thank you, I can see. Panni is ill a lot lately. She's got whooping cough. - What happened to Gyimesi? - He called in sick. Why wasn't I told? I only knew this morning. Green. It's a great honour to serve next to the Comrade Lieutenant-Colonel. - When you're not standing in, what do you do? - I teach. - At the Political Academy? - Yes. And what do you teach? - You amongst other things. - No! Yes! I've just set my students essays on Comrade Mark: The time in Spain, your time as a prisoner of war, you injury... Is it true that Stalin met you at the airport when they exchanged you for that French officer? We're here to see Imre Csap. And who are you? Are you really Jung's father? Why did they send you? So I can learn. You already know the first rule, don't you? Keep my mouth shut. You just sit, observe and leave the evaluation to me. Jung is my best man. If he's having an affair with a woman, there's a reason and it's not love. It's me. What's happening with Jung? He's just left. How much time have we got left About 40 minutes. We're hurrying. - Dohny. - We've got the photograph. We need a copy. - Now? - 20 minutes. Impossible. - We have to get there before Jung. - Okay, hang on... Agent? Civilian. Be discrete. Thanks. And, Feri... Find out which hospital Kulcsr's daughter's in. - Kulcsr's daughter? - She's got whooping cough. - I'm just closing. - We'll help you. See? Beria. - Sorry? - Beria met me at the airport. I never met Stalin. So, how much longer? - I'll take that. - Don't touch it! You'll burn your hand! That's fine. Thank you. Would you go out? Out! Be quick because I have to buy my grandson a gun. - What? - A toy gun. For Christmas. We'll tell you when we're done. Where do have to take it? Where's the drop-off? - I don't know. - Think hard! I can't tell you. Where do you have to leave the envelope? - Jung'll kill me! - Are you scared of Jung orme? Jung... He's a madman. You can kill me but you won't get anything out of me... No, no, wait! Let me go! I'll tell you everything! - Comrade Mark! - Let me go! I'll tell you everything! Danube! Down by the Danube! By the railway bridge! - Hello? - Send Vgh over. Tell him to bring a bandage and to clean Csap up. And tell him to bring a toy gun. The State Protection Authority was disbanded last December but Comrade Kdr secretly organised for the new - Political Investigations Department to take all personnel. - Rkosi's men. They have to pass a test. Yes, the Kdrtest. The subjects can't know about the test, can they? The point is that they don't know. Comrade Mark, do you think there is any point to these tests? I could think of better things to do at Christmas. Look, there's the barrel! We'd better hurry! The tin! Give it to me! Here! Comrade Mark, there's another barrel! Now what? Hurry, Comrade Mark! He's coming! Comrade Mark, quickly! Hurry! He's there! I can see! Behind the tree! CORVIN LANE What's your relationship like with Jung? Close? With an officer? We talk about popular music. He knows that I play the piano. I invited him to a Bartk recital a couple of weeks ago. I played Rhapsody no. 1. And some say it wasn't too bad... Did Jung go? I was more surprised than anybody. My cellist, Fanni, was ill that day and she suggested her roommate, a certain va Gti. Jung asked me to introduce him to her after the concert. He wanted to congratulate her. I told Fanni and that's how it happened. Did you know they've been seeing each other since? They make a nice couple. They go well together. Did Jung suspect the girl? He never said as much but... when we met last week, he asked me to help him. What did he want? For me to ask Fanni about the girl. Who she is, where she came from... Did you learn anything? Everything, but the champagne supper cost me a fortune... va tries to get into the Music Academy every year but they won't take her because she's a class alien. Do you know why she's on the B list? She took part in the counter-revolution. They caught her but soon let her go. She looked like a little fish but if they'd seen the photo, they'd have known she wasn't. Not at all... va Gti fought at Corvin Lane and killed secret police officers. Secret police just like you. Nothing... He didn't say a word. What do you think? He's in trouble. Andrs Jung is in trouble. Right in the middle of his test, when he's being watched, he learns that his lover is a counter-revolutionary or even worse, an enemy agent. The question is what will he do with this information? No, the question is what will we do with it? We'll keep watching him. And I'll keep my mouth shut. He's drawn the curtains. What's happening? I've got no idea. Comrade Mark, how well do you know Andrs Jung? I was a recruiter and I travelled the country looking for talented kids. I found Andris in Rcegrespuszta. He didn't belong to anyone, he had no one but he was very interested in our work. He had a lot of ambition. I see. I brought him up to Budapest, clothed him and fed him. He worked with me in the department in his last year at school. That's when we were ordered to set the undercover apartments up. There was to be a whole network of them like in Moscow. Andris agreed to join the top-secret staff and live for his work for years if need be. Like a monk. But what if the monk falls in love? - What's that sound? - He's taken the phone off the hook. "Maximum 200 metres." What was that? He's found the bug. - How? - He regularly checks the telephone. Why doesn't he switch it off? - He's realised. - What? What's he realised? He's coming over. He's coming over? He's got a gun! We've got to disappear. Call Vgh now! - He's not picking up. - Where is that idiot?! He came up for Csap to take him home. Fuck! Don't cry. It'll get better. It's not your hand... - Don't let anyone in! - Why, what's going on? Stop! I'm fine. What's happening? Open the door! Go! - Good evening. - Who are you looking for? Who lives in the corner flat on the third? No one. It's empty. I saw movement. It's being decorated. You can't come in! Young man! Young man! Stop! What the hell was that? We're always the last to know. Are you gentlemen secret police? Evening. Evening. Are you working? I'm guarding the stuff. On Christmas Eve? Until the boys get back. Then we're going to celebrate... Decorating? We're doing the whole floor. Is there something you want? Who are you? Why are you watching me? I don't know what you're talking about. Who's in there? Young man! Come down this minute! Clear off! Come down now or I'll call the police! I'm calling the police! I'm going... and I'll call them! Neither of us wants the police here. I'll be back. I'll be here. He's gone. Get inside! You should be ashamed... a sick old lady... He's gone back. Where's Mark? Andris! They're watching us. I know. They put a bug in the telephone. They can see and hear everything. - Who are they? - The Patai circle. They've rented the flat opposite and they're watching from there. But we're watching them. And when the moment comes, we'll step in. It's vital that you don't break your cover. What should I do? Go up to the flat and call the woman. She's in on it, too. You know what you have to do, don't you? - Something's disappeared. - What? It was there this morning and now it's not. - What? - I've looked for it everywhere. - What? - The agent list. Get up there! Go! At last! Nice work. Thanks. Hello? It's your wife, Comrade. Janka? - Hello. - Pali...? Pali, you said 5 o'clock. I've laid the table. Andris is making a quick call. You're not working, are you? There's a small problem with the flat... - Is something wrong? - No. We'll hurry. I've got to go. See you later. Yes? It's me. Andris, there's nothing wrong, is there? No. Nothing's wrong. Your voice sounds so strange. Is there something you want to say? I love you. - Should I come over? - That'd be good. I'm on my way. Rewind. Shit! Who are you working for?! What do you want from Jung? - Talk! - Comrade Mark... Comrade Mark... put the gun down before someone sees you. The comrade won't run away. Stand up! Let me introduce Lieutenant va Gti. Lieutenant? What lieutenant? From the Investigations Department. We instructed her to get close to Jung and steal his agent list. Of course we know about the agent list. It's part of the test, Comrade Mark. We test how the subject behaves under pressure. That was pressure, all right. And if it goes on like this, I won't be able to able to vouch for Jung. That's the idea. That's the exact idea. We aim to create a situation where the subject is forced to choose between his job and his emotions. It's the Moscow method. That's what we use. What we use? And who uses it? Everyone. Since when? Since now. Why don't I know about this? It's top-secret. People are only told what they need to know. Only told what they need to know? Exactly, Comrade Mark. It's your method. We've just refined it a little. The test is over! - I can't allow you to break our cover! - Out of my way! - What did you just say?! - Move! I didn't hear. I said move! I'm in charge of the test now. - You've got no authorisation! - But I do! Show me! Here. Feri, - call the minister! - It's pointless at this hour of the night... It's not pointless for me. Feri... Call him! Good evening. I'll hand you to Comrade Mark. Hello, Sndor. Sorry to disturb you but there's a small problem... Emil Kulcsr, yes. The test invigilator... Sorry? He? I see. Fine. Sorry. And happy holidays! Bye. Thank you. And now what? Are you going to send me home? Do you want to go home? Then let's get back to work! We want our allies and our enemies to know that our country will heal the wounds caused by counter-revolutionaries and that we are determined that Hungarian land, that has been watered by the sweat of generations of peasants and workers and where bourgeois rule left the country in ruins 12 years ago, will be rebuilt as a free, independent, socialist homeland... Do you love him? Because he loves you. Of course he loves me. We've reached the final stage. Comrade, it's time. They'll kill each other. Who'll kill who? You've gone too far, Kulcsr. There are two possible outcomes. One is that Jung breaks off with the woman and in which case he'll pass the test. The other is that he breaks his cover in which case he'll fail. He'll end it. Who gave you the angel? Pali. He's like a father to me... If it wasn't for him, I'd have died in the muck like my old man. He got me into school and I've got him to thank for everything. Have you told him about us? No. Why? He must really love you. I was supposed to be having supper at their place tonight. Sour cream? A drop of wine? No, thanks. - Hello? - I'll have a drop more. It's for you... Comrade Kulcsr. The bottle's in the kitchen. Don't bother... Hello, yes? I can't... Not now... Is there a problem, Comrade Kulcsr? It's my daughter. She's worse. She needs you. I know, but... We're only human, Comrade Kulcsr. You go. The comrade minister will understand. He doesn't have to know. No, he doesn't. Comrade Plmai! Dohny, record everything. Get everything. Take Comrade Kulcsr to the hospital. I'll be right back. Thanks. You've never told me about your parents. There's nothing to tell. What were they like? I suppose today you'd say that they were bourgeois and they took everything from them. My father was taken on forced labour, he didn't have boots and he never came back from the front. You mother? She taught piano... to aristocracy. She left a couple of years ago. She said she couldn't live in a country where they banned "Gloomy Sunday". She defected. Is that why they wouldn't accept you at the Music Academy? Because of your mother? The cabbage is delicious. They can do anything in this wretched secret-police country! Why aren't you eating? Eat! I've lost my appetite. But if we'd won last year... Did you believe in it? We were so close. We never stood a chance! - But if they'd not tricked Malter... - I know nothing about Malter but I saw what happened at Corvin Lane. Were you there? Did you fight? Let's dance. Who are you working for? Who are you working for? You know I'm not working now. Who are you working for? Are you all right? Who are you working for? I - You scare me. - Where is it? I don't know what you're talking about. The list. What have you done with it? - What list? - I know you took it. - I didn't... - Who did you give it to? It was in my drawer. It went missing after you left. - I never touched it. - Do you think it just evaporated?! - Perhaps you put it somewhere else... - I didn't put it anywhere. You stole it! I stole it from you? A stupid list? You're insane! - You're not going anywhere! - Leave me alone! Who are you working for? I'm not working for anybody! How long have you been watching? Who are you? Who did you give the list to? Fuck your list! I saw your bloody photo... Csap showed me... What photo? Why? Is there more than one with a machine gun? That was a long time ago. It wasn't me... And this morning? When you were standing by the desk... Andris, I'm telling you the truth... Andris, Andris... Andris, look into my eyes... If he keeps torturing her, we'll call it off. You're such a fool, you're such an idiot... a fool... ...arsehole! I trusted you. This flat is busier than Keleti Station and you suspect me?! Mark. He's found it. Shit! Nothing. I'm going over. - Check the back streets! - Comrade Kulcsr said... - The orders have changed! - Yes, sir. We heard screams and a struggle. Go back to your flat! - Should I go call the police? - Don't think about it! Drop the gun! Where's the girl? - Did you hurt her? - Isn't that what you wanted? Andris, she's a counter-revolutionary. - The Patai circle was spying on you... - It was you. I know it's the test today. I know you've been playing with me! va told me everything. Comrade, you have seriously infringed the test regulations... If it turns out that you told the subject that his test is today... If it turns out that you came over in the middle of the test... Have you broken cover on the whole operation? Wait outside. That's an order! How long were you going to wait? You've really fucked me, Andris! In the undercover flat? On the day of your test? - Would you give up your career? - You'd do the same for Janka! No, you're mistaken! Running after your dick? You didn't learn that from me! You've broken all the rules, Andris. You've failed. I'm disappointed in you! Get dressed, Janka's waiting! What about the list? Thanks. Now we can eat in peace. Call her in. Do what I say. - Anything? - Nothing. I'm here now. What stage are we at? Thank you. - Now where are you going? - To get my coat and then I'm gone. You go! You're just like all women! Never look for me again! I won't. Don't worry! Give me the microphone. time: 20:43. Agent Andrs Jung's test has been completed. You were right, Comrade Mark. Jung really is your best man. He just does what he has to. Going home? Yes... for supper. I'd happily accept a little leftover fish soup. Shall we go? What? Lieutenant Kulcsr called and said we should take the Comrade Lieutenant-Colonel in for debriefing. But we're just going home. He said it's urgent. It'll only take half an hour. Comrade Kulcsr? We have gathered here to evaluate the results of today's test. I'll ask Comrade Lieutenant-Colonel Mark to summarise the events of the last 12 hours. Today, on December 24, 1957, in accordance with order no. 16 issued by the Ministry of the Interior of the People's Republic of Hungary, the Cultural Espionage Section held Agent Andrs Jung's test. During which Comrade Jung's loyalty was tested to the full. Comrade Jung dealt excellently with the situation, never broke his cover and passed the test with top marks. Did you establish contact with Comrade Jung during the test? Me? No. Did you in any way try to influence the outcome of the test? No. Did you act in the interest of the socialist state and the workers' movement at all times? At all times. Comrade Jung. ...I'll switch the bug back on at 20:00. I want you to pretend to break up. And Kulcsr? I've lured him to the hospital. He'll hear you breaking up on tape when he gets back. No one can know about what happened today. Do you maintain your statement, Comrade Mark? I do. Did you act in the interest of the socialist state and the workers' movement at all times? At all times... I might have broken a few small rules but that was only to bring these two young people back to the right path. va Gti? Yes. You completed the test with top marks. Congratulations. - Andrs Jung? - Present. You completed the test with top marks. Congratulations. The committee will recommend your promotion and a position at the Ministry of the Interior. va Gti will take up residence at the now vacant undercover apartment. Pl Mark? You failed the test. You have been dismissed from the Political Investigations Department and your exclusion from the Party will be initiated. Your vacant post will be filled by Comrade Emil Kulcsr. You may go. Good work. I had a good teacher. Csap had it right when he said you're a nice couple. You go well together. You disappointed me. Is that everything? Yes. We can go.
