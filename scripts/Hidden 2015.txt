GIRL: I can't. Olive is scared. Mam. Dawn here. ZaZa, what are you doing under here? ZOE: Mom, I told you, I don't like that stupid baby name anymore. My name's Zoe. And I'm under here because I'm hiding. Olive said we had to hide. She dreamed they found us. Who did? - The Breathers. -Hey, what did we just talk about? Our new rule, remember? Rule number four. We're not allowed to talk about them anymore. I didn't. Olive did. CLAIRE: Well, you can tell Olive that no one found us. Dad's been keeping watch all night, just like always. We're safe here. ZOE: You hear that, Olive? OLIVE [ON RECORDING]: My smile is stuck. - Her smile is stuck. That means she doesn't want to be smiling anymore. That means she's still scared. Would it make Olive feel better if we went and checked with Dad? It's okay. All right. Came an. It's okay. ZOE: Mam, lack. CLAIRE: That's just Dad. -it doesn't lack like Dad. [GASPS] RAY: Oh. Someone had another nightmare? ZOE: Dad. Hey,hey. - Thought we told those nightmares to go away. -We did. - Well, then why are you so scared? -Better ask Olive about that. RAY: Oh, was it Olive this time, huh? Haw does she even sleep with her eyes open all the time? - Dad, don't be mean. -I was just wandering. - She wants a report. -Well, then I better consult my notes. RAY: Hmm. Tsk, tsk. [IN BRITISH ACCENT] My glasses, please. Thank you. Sc my watch started at 10. At 2, I played seven games of solitaire. Wan four, last three. Last four, wan three. Ms. Zoe, you see right through me. At 5, a couple of deer ran overhead. And at 5 in the morning, I heard little footsteps. Possibly belonging to my rascal of a daughter. Hmm? But other than that, nothing, not a creature was stirring, not even-- - A Breather? CLAIRE: ZaZa. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Na, not even a... ...you know. -And the locks'? - They still hold fast'? -Do you wanna check'? - Can I? -Na. Ray, I told you I don't want her up there. What? This little monkey? She can handle it. Yeah, I can handle it, Morn. I know the rules. One, never be laud. - I know you know. -Two: Never lose control. Three: Never open the dour. Four: Never talk about the Breathers. - Careful, ZaZa, your shoe. - I gut it, Mam. RAY: Hold fast? ZOE: Hold fast. ZOE: Can't I just go barefoot? Na, that wouldn't be right. Why not? Because we're not animals, Zoe. I need you to remember that. But it's not like I'm going outside or anything. Well, who needs to go outside when we brought the sun with us? Another beautiful day, huh? Mm-hm. You wanna make it official? Nat tan hard, okay? I don't want you to slip. ZOE: I gut it, Mam. RAY: O Kay. - How many days is that? CLAIRE: If you don't remember, just count them. They're lined up in rows of 25. And there are haw many rows? ZOE: One, two, three, eight, nine. Twelve. CLAIRE: Sc 25 times 12 makes? Three hundred plus the 1 I just marked. Sc 301. That's it. See? Those math lessons are really paying off. OLIVE [ON RECORDING]: Give me a kiss. - That means she's hungry. Let's see here. We've got hominy... ...corn, potatoes, beans. - And peaches. -Peaches. Definitely peaches. You know, we had peaches yesterday. We can have them again tomorrow. But I was thinking today, maybe we should try something with a little protein. - Maybe beans for once. -Ew, beans are the worst. - Dad. Beans or peaches? RAY: Yeah? Uh, I don't know. -[VVHISPERS] Peaches. -Peaches sound pretty good to me. CLAIRE: Ray. - Uh, haw about we take a vote? -Ray. All those in favor of beans, please raise your hand. One vote for beans. New, all those in favor of deliciously sweet peaches, raise your hand. Sorry, hon. Two against one. Three. [GRUNTING] -Is Darlene acting up again? -Na, she's a tough gal. She just needs a little encouragement, that's all. [CHUCKLES] [PIPES CLANGING] There we go. Told you she was tough. Mam. Dad. The peaches are gone. CLAIRE: Not funny, ZoZo. -I'm serious. Someone stole them. Gad. That's 12. That's 12 cans. That's almost two weeks of rations. There are no more peaches? Uh, no. Na more peaches. Something must've been drawn ta the sugar. Something with teeth. What has teeth like that? A rat, probably. But a rat couldn't get in here. I checked the dour. It's hold fast. The dour is not the only way in. Can the Breathers get in there tan? - ZaZa. -Can they? Na, they're tan big to fit in there. But a rat could. CLAIRE: If it's a rat, it's still in here somewhere. We have to keep an eye out. We have to find it before it steals any more fond. In the meantime, we'll have to cut dawn an our rations. Dad, they're already so small. I'm sorry, Zoe. I really am. I'm not gonna ask you again. Eat. - Mam, I told you, I don't want stupid beans. -Hey, remember rule number two. Never lose central. - Never let anger take aver. -Rule number five: Never call me ZaZa. - I just wanted some peaches. -A thief stale them. And new we're all gonna have to give some things up. I already have nothing. I'm stuck in here. I can't even go outside. I don't have any friends except Olive and she can only say five things. RAY: What about us? -What? Well, you said you don't have any friends. What about us? Mam and I aren't your friends? - You know what I mean. RAY: No, actually, I don't. I think it's silly to say you don't have anything when you really have everything. - Yeah, right. -Yeah, right. Lack at that. - Haw many days did you say that was? -Three hundred and one. Three hundred and one. We shouldn't have been around for any one of those days. But just when we needed it... ...we found this shelter... ...and it's given us fond, a home, a life. And for all we know, we could be the only ones left, the only ones still alive. Sc every one of those marks is really a miracle. - A miracle? -That's right. A miracle. And this fund is gonna allow you to live another day. And that means another hatch can be drawn, right? Yeah, I guess so. So you see those nasty cold mushy beans on your plate? They're really their awn kind of miracle tan. And if you eat your mushy miracles for us... ...then maybe we can take a trip afterwards. - A trip? Really? -Really. But you better eat fast, because I finished my miracle beans and I want mare. [ZOE GIGGLING] ZOE: Careful with it, Dad. - Mm-hm. -Mm-hm. ZOE: That goes there. Joey's house goes there. -All right.

[LAUGHS] [IN NORMAL VOICE] And she hands you one of those little pink plastic spoons. And you run your other hand along that cold glass countertop. Inside, you see barrels and barrels of Sylvia's fresh homemade ice cream. But new it's still early, so she's gut all the best flavors. Salted Haney. Peanut Butter Brittle Crunch. And of course, your favorite. - Strawberry Shortcake. -Ha, ha. Are you there? You happy new? Till tomorrow. Till tomorrow. ZOE: You win. I win. - Aha. lwin. RAY: Everything's gonna work out. CLAIRE: I'm trying to believe that, Ray. I really am. But imaginary ice cream isn't gonna feed our daughter. ZOE: Told you. RAY: Just trying to keep her spirits up. CLAIRE: And you are. But what happens when she gets sick? We've lost a lot of weight already, all of us, and now... And new we're just gonna have to find a way to get more fond. Real fond. I'll go to the damn surface if I have to. You can't, Ray. - They're still lacking for us. -Yeah, well, I can fight them. That's suicide, and you know it. Dc you remember our promise when we first gut here? Zoe comes first. Na matter the cast. - The important thing is we haven't been found. -Except by a rat. But only by a rat. Oh, honey. Try changing your paint of view. This shelter can be a prison or it can be a home. - Beans can be beans or they can be-- -Miracle beans. - Why not? Because I'm not 9 years old, Ray. I get what you're trying to do for ZaZa. But I don't believe in miracles. - Not anymore. -Well, you should. This is our life new, and we have to live it the best we can. Or else what's the paint? - The paint is ta stay alive. -And we can do that... ...and still live. Mm? CLAIRE: Ray? -Huh? What are you doing? Living. CLAIRE: Well, we gotta be real quiet. -Relax.

Playground. Nothing. Dad's right. It's just us left. - Us and Olive. -But do you see us and Olive? - No, Mom. -Do you see the shelter door? - I can't see the dour. It's covered. -Exactly. When we first came dawn here, Dad and I made sure to hide the dour, remember? Sc that no one could ever find us. - So? ...sometimes, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there. Sometimes the Ruth's hidden from us. Dc you think our friends could really be out there? They're just hidden like us'? They could. They'd have to be. Because the Breathers would be hunting them? ZaZa. Yeah, the Breathers would be hunting them tan. They hate us a lat, don't they? Ta keep hunting us like that? I don't know that it's hate. It's just... They're different than we are. And that makes them as scared of us as we are of them. - Because of what happened that day? -Yeah. Because of what happened. - You said Breathers. -I know. [ZOE GASPS] The thief. He's back.
