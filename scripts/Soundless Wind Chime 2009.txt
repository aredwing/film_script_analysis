A long time ago, during the night, There was a man riding a bike along the lake of Fluelen. He had been lost in the dark for 18 years, Trying to find his way home, but no one could help him. One night while the moon was shinning brightly, A silvery road appeared along the lakeside leading him home. His family realized that he had returned. He waved to say his last goodbye, And was gone before the birds started to sing. - Food delivery. - Finally... - How much is it? - 22 dollars. - Keep the change. - Thanks. - Wonton noodles to go. - Okay. What took you so long? Those are for around the block. Hey, Ricky. Get me 2 bottles of soy sauce. Here you go. That guy ahead That foreigner Excuse me, Sir. Your ID, please? Do you have one? You should shout out for help. People around will help you. And the police will stop him... Say something! Hurry up! I have to go back to bed. Come on, the traffic light is changing... I'm going back. You sure you know how to replace your ID? Got any luck? - Nothing. - Shit, what happened? I almost got caught. What's this? Alright, it's getting cold, put on a coat. I'll call you... Hold on, he just got back, want to talk to him? - Who is it? - Your mom, of course. Hi, mom. Just got back from work. I've eaten. I was showing my client how to buy stocks. How's your waist? Any better? Have you seen a doctor? What did he say? Why don't you go to the hospital in the city? They have better equipment. Take care of yourself. Bye. I think she is seriously sick this time. The neighbors do the cooking for her everyday. Give her a call when you have time. Have a seat. Can I take your order? Drinks? Iced tea with milk, no sugar. Iced tea without sugar. Iced tea without sugar. Looking for anyone? He left a wallet... Do you want a sandwich? Do you live nearby? Thank you. You're welcome. You girls are early today. Wait... Who the hell is he? He is a friend. I'm telling you, don't make any noise while I'm with a client. Such a pain! Have a seat, dear. - Is there anyone else staying with you? - a girl friend. Let's have a threesome. Don't be silly, she is not back yet. Let's get started... What is your name in Chinese? He's good. Where did you meet him? Is he from the Moscow Circus? Ask him to jump through a ring of fire... What did she say? She asked me if you've worked in a circus before... No... Look, he can even juggle while talking. Bravo... Bravo... Jump, jump... Fire, fire... You jump, I jump... Don't just talk about it. Your English is very good. My English... very good... You are very good too... - Please come again, dear. - Sure. Your business is good... How long is your friend gonna stay? What's wrong? Haven't you seen a naked woman before? Are you messing around with that white guy? So you're gay? Don't ever let your mom come to Hong Kong. I'm not sure what'll happen... if she finds out what we're doing. - Whose turn is it? - It's my turn... Not here... - Bingo... Pay up. - No way... It's not fair... Are you cheating? Pay up... Where are you going? He has a job interview tomorrow. - I'll give you a treat tomorrow. - Please Get the heck out of here... - Get out... - Pay up... - Hello. - Hello. - I am coming for the job interview. - OK. Yes, I used to be a babysitter in the French part of Switzerland. He said he was a babysitter. Wait, he doesn't look too friendly. He might scare the kids. All foreigners look like that. Besides, he works part time... so we don't have to pay the benefits. And we don't need him to teach anyway. Just to show the parents that we have a native English teacher. It's good for our reputation... We can find someone cheaper from the headhunters. - But he's... - Alright, that's enough... He's fine. Tell him to start working on Monday. Wait, Ricky. There's one last order. Food delivery... Ma'am, did you make an order? Did you? Did you make an order, ma'am? Have a seat... have a seat... There're chopsticks...in the kitchen... I'm not hungry. I can't walk. Have a seat. I don't have the common cold, nor do I know Snow White and Sneezy dwarf. Why do I sneeze day and night all the time? What's going on in here? Last week, there was a Lee... who got down on one knee. He begs me to agree to get married with him. And there was a Ji, who made threats to me. He wants me to be loyal as a puppy. It must be the 2 of them, talking about me non-stop day and night. So I go sneezing 24-7, go on and on all night. Hello... Ricky? What took you so long? That woman has Parkinson's... Can I have 2 wonton noodles to go? - That's your wage for today. - Thanks. Sorry, I had a last minute order to deliver. How was your interview? - Come... - What? - Hey! - Hello! - How are you? - Fine. I've brought you some food. It was very busy at the restaurant today. I'm not hungry. Hi. Can I help you? Sorry, do you speak English? Can I help you? No, I'm just looking around... Okay. Sorry, this is not for sale. Sorry. It's okay. This one, too. How could you do this? Are you okay? She's my sister. Your sister... Does she always behave like that? I'm looking for a friend. How did you hurt your hand? When was the last time you cried? I'm looking for a friend. He smiles a lot and cries a lot. My god, long time no see... - How are you? - Thank you. Cheers... Hey, he's buying you a drink... - Hi, I'm Steve. - I'm Ricky. How are you, Ricky? Do you want to go now? The door is unlocked, come on in. Easy... Careful... Here...clean it up. - How much is it? - 32 dollars. Keep the change. Just close the door on your way out. Do you want noodles or fried rice? Pascal, how are you? I looked for you everywhere. I thought you've gone back to Switzerland. What do you do now? I have a job. Pascal, don't you want to give me a hug? I love you. I'm sorry. I want you back. My God... Are you OK? These are for you on the train. It's expensive eating on board. Give that watch to your uncle. Finish the cakes by Friday before it goes off. Have you brought a jacket? It's chilly when you get off. Do you have RMB on you? Give me a call if your Mom gets worse. I'll try to go back to see her. Where's your friend? Isn't he coming? He's working. He got a job now? What does he do? He teaches English. Really? I thought he speaks French. That's German. People think all foreigners speak English. Good for him. The called party cannot be reached at the moment. Please call later. That book belonged to my mother. He's coming back... In a while. What? You can wait... Say hi for me. The called party cannot be reached at the moment. Please call later. Mom, I just got back. Do you feel any better? I finally got your letter. The money's still there. I know, I know... Don't forget your pills. You must go see a doctor again if you're not getting any better. Or just go to the hospital in the city. You're early. Alright, take care of yourself, mom. Bye. There's some food in the fridge if you haven't eaten. Sorry. Did your mother send you something? Nothing much. How are you today? How is she? It's negative, it's cancer. I'm sorry. How are you these days? Fine. Tell me something about Beijing. Have you seen Steve lately? Did the doctor tell you how long she could live? I thought you guys are good friends. He has a new boyfriend. It doesn't mean that he'll stop fucking around. Hey, watch you mouth! Hey, that's mine. I can't read Chinese anyway. People change, you know. Don't regret things, and stop talking like this. Letters are for words that you can't say out loud. You can't take back something that has been said. Maybe I wrote you letters but I never gave them to you... More than once... And you don't know. Show me. For me? Wanna share? Why? Just because... Because I don't want you to owe me anything. I'm sorry. I'm just being honest. Just eat, forget what I said... Wonton noodles. What? I ordered beef noodles... That's for table no. 3. I said 3. What's wrong with you? It's steaming hot! Are you trying to kill me? I'll get a towel. Ricky, come here! Didn't you sleep last night? Just go home and get some sleep! Come on, clean it up... Where are you going? Where are you going? - Hey... - Get out! You stay. I'll go. Do you want to kiss me? We'd like to get this bag. Can I have your ID, please? This document is 5 years ago. Yes, it's been a while. I'll see what I can do. Lucky you, the bag is still here. Thank you. I need your signature. You know, when people die, Their soul will attach to an animal And come back 7 days after their death. Like a bird, or a moth... Why? To say their last goodbye. And prepare for their new life. - Good morning! - Morning! You speak Cantonese very well now. Ricky, open the door. That's 3 times a day, and that's 4 times a day. This is antipyretic. Take one each night before going to bed... and she'll sleep better. Her legs are weak, you should help her get up. Bathe her every other day. Wipe her often. Take good care of your mother. Good luck. Aunt called from Hong Kong yesterday. She asked about you. She said she had bought ticket... to see you in 2 weeks. Are you going to Tian Tong Yuan? - Do you need a ride? - Yes. - How much is it? - 6 dollars. - How about 5? - Alright, get on. Where are you going? Heizhima Hutong, okay. Get in. Who is it? Hello. Come in, come in... I'm looking for... Ricky. Yes, Ricky. Does he live here? Have a seat... Thank you. He's my son. I'm his mother. You're mother of Ricky. I'm a friend of Ricky. Friend... I'm Yu-hua. How about you? What's your name? I'm Yu-hua. What's your name? I'm a friend... I'm Ueli... I'm looking for Ricky. Is Ricky home? He is working. He'll be back at 7. The bottles of milk are broken. Wake up, Ricky. Let's go out to have breakfast. The moon shinning down the river, Like a silver platter. Looking at it, I'm missing... I'm missing my beloved. On a night like tonight, With singing from the opposite bank We couldn't help being tempted. We held and we kissed, Looking shyly at the glistening waves. On a night like tonight, With singing from the opposite bank Our hearts were broken. We grieved and we cried, With the glistening waves at our back. The moon shinning down the river, Like a silver platter. Looking at it, I'm missing... I'm missing my beloved. How do you say I love you in German again?
