Every unhappy family|is unhappy in its own way...' It's good... Very good! Oh, God! A telegram for you, sir. How's Darya Alexandrovna? She instructed me to tell you|that she is leaving and that he can... that is you, sir,|can do as you like. Anna Arkadyevna will be here|tomorrow. Thank God!|Alone or with her husband? Alone. Shall I get the room ready|upstairs? Ask Darya Alexandrovna.|Do as she orders. So what should we do, Matvey? Oh, well, we'II wait and see. Help me dress now. It's six o'clock|and the children are unfed. All they had was yesterday's broth. - Send someone for milk.|- Whom shall I send? The chef left yesterday, and the cook's packing,|she wants to be paid off today. Everything in the house|is topsy-turvy. Leave me alone! Go to her, sir. Ask her to forgive|you. She will come round. - What?|- I say she will come round. You think so? Now why should this happen to me? As you make your bed,|so must you lie in it... It's terrible. - Dolly!|- What do you want? Dolly... Anna is coming tomorrow. Well, what is that to me?|I can't receive her. Oh, but you must, Dolly. Go away! Dolly...|What can I say? Only one thing: forgive me. Go away. Cannot nine years of our life together atone for an instant of|infatuation? Don't talk to me about such filth. Dolly, for God's sake, think of|the children! It's not their fault. Punish me. Yes, punish me. I can't find words to express|how guilty I feel. Forgive me, Dolly!|Please, forgive me. I do think of the children. I would do anything to save them. Tell me, after what has happened, can we go on living together? After my husband,|the father of my children, had a love affair|with his children's governess? What can I do?|What can I do? You are loathsome, repulsive. Your tears mean nothing.|You have never loved me. You are disgusting!|A perfect stranger! It's awful. One word more... If you come near me, I will call everybody and|let them know you're a scoundrel! l'm leaving now. And you may live here|with your mistress. MOSCOW A councilman, a landowner,|a gymnast, Grinevich. A cattle-breeder, a sportsman and my|friend, Konstantin Dmitrievich Lyovin. May I see you alone for a minute?|Excuse me. Wait for me here. My wife is ill.|I cannot invite you. I only wish to say a few words to you. All right. L'm meeting my sister|Anna from Petersburg. How are the Shcherbatskys?|The same as ever? Well, yes...|They're all right. It's a shame that you hardly come|to Moscow. - Why?|- Oh, nothing. Where are you staying? I don't know yet.|You haven't answered my question. How is Kitty? I always know a fine steed by|dum de dum... of his breed, and a lovesick knight|by something in his stride. - So that's why you came to town!|- Ah, then you've guessed. What do you think of my chances? Who? Me?|I could hope for nothing better. You think it's possible? Of course. Why not? If you wish to see them,|go to the skating-rink. Kitty skates there|from four to five. You'II surely see her there.|l'II come and fetch you. Vronsky! Your Excellency!|How are you? Whom are you meeting? - Do you know him?|- Yes, we have met. An honest man. Very straightforward,|a heart of gold. He's come here to propose|to my sister-in-law. - Kitty?|- Yes. I think she could make|a better match. Yes, of course! But he's been in love|for so long. L'm really sorry for him. Yes, it's a painful situation.|And who are you meeting? A pretty woman. So that's it. - My sister Anna.|- Ah, Madame Karenina. - You know her?|- I think I do... Though l'm not sure. Surely you must know her husband,|Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin? All the world knows him! l've heard he's clever|and very influential. He's a wonderful man.|Rather conservative, but very nice. You got my telegram? - Did you have a good trip, maman?|- Very good indeed. This is Madame Karenina. Her husband arranged for us to ride|together. I was delighted. I hear you often visit|the Shcherbatskys. Is it a case of ideal love? I don't quite know|what you mean, maman? Have you found your brother? Anna Arkadyevna has a little son,|from whom she's never been separated, so she keeps worrying about|having left him. Excuse me. I hadn't recognized you. But I recognized you, because your|mother and I talked only about you. - You must have been very bored.|- On the contrary! I scarcely noticed|how the time passed. The guard didn't hear|the train to reverse. And he was crushed, cut in half. How horrible!|If you'd only seen it, Anna! His wife was there too.|She flung herself on the body. They say he was the only support|of a very large family. Can't anything be done|to help them? Oh, my God! Why did this have|to happen? For whose benefit do you intend|the 200 rubles? The widow. Whom did you think? This is a bad omen. Nonsense, my dear.|You're here, that's the main thing. You can't imagine|how much l'm counting on you. Have you known Vronsky for long? He is a capital fellow, rich,|has a brilliant future. We hope he will marry|Kitty Shcherbatsky. Now tell me all about you. I can't possibly leave him.|There're the children... l'm tied... I understand, Dolly. He doesn't realize the awfulness|of my situation. He seems contented. Oh no, he's to be pitied,|he's full of remorse. Is he capable of remorse?|She's young, she's pretty. They certainly talked about me. Or, worse still, they didn't talk|about me at all! The awful thing is that everything's|changed in my heart. Instead of love and tenderness|I feel nothing but hatred. I could kill him! What am I to do, Anna?|Think for me, help me. l've thought it all over|and see no way out. - Could you forgive him?|- I don't know. But still, Dolly, I think,|l'd forgive him. I could never feel the same again, but l'd still forgive him|as though nothing had happened. Oh, darling, l'm so happy|you've come. Of course, if I do forgive him... I would have to do it completely,|as if nothing had happened. Completely. Go now and may God help you. Kitty! Kitty, be careful! Konstantin Dmitrievich, you here?|How do you happen to be here? Thank you. I came not long ago. I was looking for you.|I wanted to call on you. I didn't know|you skated so well. - You're considered the best skater.|- I used to skate with a passion. You do everything with a passion,|don't you? I would like to see you skating. With you I would have learned that|faster. I have confidence in you. My own confidence grows|when you lean on me. It must be dull in the country|in the winter? Oh no! I have a lot to do. - How long are you staying?|- I don't know. I don't know.|It depends on you. - On me?|- Yes, on you. I... I came to... I came to ask you...|I was looking for you. No... No, it's impossible. It couldn't be... I knew it. No, no... l'm sorry. You have a lovely sister, Dolly. What's that? I brought my ball dress|to show you. - And when is this ball?|- Next week. It's one of those balls|where everyone feels so gay. - Are there such balls?|- Certainly. Are you coming? You're looking forward to it so much|that you want everyone to be there. I want you to be there.|I see you dressed in lilac. Why must it be lilac? What a happy time of life! I remember so well that blue mist|that envelops everything. Childhood is coming to an end, and|the path leading from that vast circle which is so charmed and delightful,|is growing narrower and narrower, and it is exciting yet fearful|to go ahead. I know something about you.|Congratulations. I like him very much. I travelled with his mother, and during the whole journey|we boasted of our sons. - Have you your son's picture?|- Yes, l'II show it to you. It's absolutely ravishing!|The bow is exquisite. The rest may be a matter of taste,|but the bow! . Who could that be at this hour?|Who can that be? It's too early for my carriage, and it would be too late|for a visitor. How do you do. Good evening. - What a delightful ball.|- Yes, isn't it? - Is Lyovin here too?|- Lyovin? I don't know. l've heard a lot of good things|about him. Has Anna Arkadyevna really decided|to leave for Petersburg tomorrow? Yes, I think so. Bologoye! - Do you wish to go out for a minute?|- Yes, I want a little air. - You?|- Can I do anything for you? I had no idea you were on the train.|Why are you on this train? To be where you are. I can't help it. Forgive me if what l've said|has shocked you, but... Forget what you've said|as I forget it. I shall never forget a single word|of yours. No! Enough! Enough! ST. PETERSBURG As you can see, your husband,|as tender as a newlywed, is burning with a desire to see you. How is Seryozha? Is he well? Is this all to reward my ardor?|He's quite well. - I hope you spent a good night?|- Very good, thank you. - Count Vronsky.|- We've met, I believe. You go with the mother and return|with the son. You've been on leave? I do hope I may have the honour|of calling on you? We'II be delighted.|We receive on Mondays. What do they say in Moscow about the new bill|l've put through the Council? Let go of me! Mother is here! Mama! Seryozha! My little treasure! I must disappoint you. He has not missed you|as your husband has. So fortunate|that I had half an hour to come to meet you|and show my affection. I must be off to a Committee|meeting now. Where did you disappear to?|I expected you for dinner. I got word from Moscow|that Kitty is seriously ill. Really? You behaved wrongly, l've been|wanting to tell you that. But who is responsible? Why do you say that to me? You know why. I forbid you to speak this way. What do you want me to do? I want you to go to Moscow|and beg Kitty's forgiveness. You... don't really want that. She's a marvelous actress! Did you notice how she fell down?|She must have studied Kaulbach. Show me to Princess Myaghkaya's box. The best way to know about love is|to make a mistake and then correct it. - Even after you've married?|- Exactly. Karenina is quite changed|ever since her trip to Moscow. Women with a shadow|usually come to a bad end. When I was young, I was in love|with a deacon. I will not leave Anna to your mercy. I don't like Karenin.|In my opinion, he's plain stupid. My husband says he's one of the best|politicians on the continent. If you really love me|as you say, give me back my peace of mind. I came just to tell you that. I never knew what peace was,|so l'm unable to give it to you. I can only give you all of myself|and my love. Never say such things to me|and let us remain friends. Friends we shall never be|and you know it. l'm unable to think of you and me|separately. I see before us either despair|and wretchedness, or happiness. - Is there no chance of it?|- No! No! You know that friendship's not what|I need. Only one thing|can make me happy. That word which frightens you so. Yes, love. I don't like to use that word because it means so much to me. l'm only asking for the right to go|on hoping and suffering as I am now. If this cannot be, order me|to disappear and l'II disappear. To disappear?|I don't want to drive you away. Then let things stay as they are. - You're late!|- I came straight from the Council. - L've come to take Anna home.|- You're an amazing husband! - What's new in the higher spheres?|- The news I may have are so boring. Your Excellency,|supper is served. Anna! You're not in bed?|How extraordinary! I wish to have a talk with you. With me? What about?|Very well, let's talk. But isn't it time to go to bed? Anna, I must warn you. Warn me? Of what? I want to warn you that through|thoughtlessness or some recklessness you may cause yourself|to be talked about in society. Please, don't crackle your knuckles!|You know how I hate it. Your too animated conversation today|with Count Vronsky attracted attention. Whenever l'm bored, it annoys you and when l'm not,|you're still annoyed. Tonight I had a good time.|Is this annoying you? This is what I have to say,|and I ask you to listen to me. l'm very interested, because l'd like|to know what this is all about. As you know,|I regard jealousy as an offensive and degrading|feeling. But there are certain rules|of decorum which cannot be transgressed|with impunity. Judging by the impression|which you made on the whole company, it looked as though your conduct|was not what is to be desired. I positively don't understand.|Are you sure you're well? I must remind you of your duties before me, before you|and before Almighty God. It was not man who joined our two|lives, but our Maker. Only a crime can break this bond, and the punishment a crime of this|sort entails is a severe one. I don't understand what you're|talking about. And besides,|l'm terribly sleepy. It's too late. Too late. Oh, my God! Oh God! AII... is over. I have no one but you. Remember that. How could I ever forget|what is all my life? - For one moment of happiness...|- What... happiness? For the love of God, not a word! You see, I couldn't accept life|without love. That's the way l'm made. A woman is the pivot|around which everything turns. What can I do?|I ask you what can I do? Your wife's growing old and|you still feel so much life in you. Suddenly love pops up,|and you're lost. Too bad she was a governess|in our house. There's something... about it.|But, then, what a governess! No matter how much you study women,|something new always comes up. Well then, it's best not to study|them. A certain mathematician once said that enjoyment lies not in finding|the truth but in searching for it. You too are searching for something, you seem to be preparing a revolution|in political economy. Hear that? The cuckoo, already. Listen. They're flying. Don't tell me I missed. Splendid. We both got it. You're really lucky, Kostya. You've got everything you like here. You've got dogs, farmland, hunting|grounds. You're writing a book.|I envy you. - Sh! Hear that?|- No. - Want to stay a little longer?|- As you like. Well, Stiva,|why don't you tell me anything? Is Kitty Shcherbatsky married yet|or when is she getting married? She has no intention of getting|married. You were afraid of your rival|and ran away. The doctors have sent her to|the country, some place near here. She was very ill. Alyosha! Have you had breakfast? - And how is your weight?|- Just right. - I hear the Czar's going to be there.|- Can you imagine a race without him? I hear you've bet on me.|You might lose. Only Makhotin could beat you.|But I hear his Gladiator is limping. Don't believe it. To Peterhof! Wait! Alyosha! I saw your brother here,|he left this letter from your mother. Good luck to you! To Peterhof! Mama! Are you ill?|Your hands are so cold. No, I feel fine.|I didn't expect you. I couldn't have lived through the day|without seeing you. The races are today, aren't they? Princess Betsy promised to take me.|How's Frou-Frou? Frou-Frou? Sharp as a razor. She's one of those animals|that don't speak only because... I can see that something's wrong.|Either you're ill or... - What are you thinking about?|- Always the same thing. Please, tell me. - Shall I?|- Do, for Heaven's sake. - Shall I really tell you?|- Yes, yes! l'm going to have a child. Our fate is sealed now! But how to end it, Alexei? Leave your husband|and join your destiny to mine. They are joined as it is. He won't give up Seryozha. He's not human. He's a machine.|A spiteful machine. 'I warned you of the consequences, religious, civil and familial|consequences...' I beg you, I entreat you|to never speak to me of that! Promise you won't. When you talk to|me about it, l'm tormented. All right, but I couldn't forgive|myself for making you unhappy. Me? Unhappy?|This is my happiness! Captain Usoltsev was thrown over his|horse. He was killed on the spot. Seven riders were injured. They say His Majesty is quite|displeased. Am I late? How's Frou-Frou? Everything is fine. Ah, my beauty! The horse of Mr...|I cannot pronounce his name. Makhotin, he's my chief rival. Easy, easy, Frou-Frou. Did you get the note from mother? I can't understand what's bothering|you. You've been seen at Peterhof again. There are matters|which are not to be discussed. If that's the case, you should leave|the army. Whatever my fate,|I will never complain. Don't get upset before the race. If possible, Milord, take the lead|from the start. Princess Tverskaya,|the pearl of Peterhof. Princess!|What a pleasant surprise! Hello, little sister! When shall we see each other? You're not worth the trouble.|Who's that with you? Vlassieva. The one who's marrying Topov? Yes, and imagine, they're marrying|for love. Oh, who talks of love these days?|An antediluvian concept. It seems that this stupid fashion|never goes out of style. So much the worse for those|who keep it up. There's something of Louis XV|about him, don't you think? He's in your drawing-room's style,|that's why we so often see him there. - Who are you betting on?|- Prince Kuzovlev. I bet on Vronsky. - Bet a pair of gloves?|- A pair of gloves! The ovation you received for|putting your bill through the Council. l'm gratified that at last|we are getting around to firm and sound views|on these matters. Your Excellency,|may I pay my respects? How have you been this year? The doctor came to see me and|took an hour of my time this morning. I suspect he was sent|by one of my friends. My health seems to be so precious. Your friend was doing it for Russia. Good afternoon, Alexei Alexandrovich.|Aren't you in the races today? l'm engaged in a more dangerous race. Are you looking for your wife?|She's here. My eyes are dazzled|by so much glitter. If England is able|to point with pride to the most brilliant cavalry|exploits in military history, it's only thanks to the fact that she|has developed strength historically in both her animals and her men. Sports seem to be very important, although, as we see,|it's quite a superficial notion. It's not all that superficial.|One officer broke two ribs. Well, let's admit it's not superficial, but that's not the point. Don't forget that those who race|are military men, who have chosen their careers. You must agree that every profession has its dangers, of course. However, the manly games|that we're watching... the horrible sports, such as prize-|fighting or Spanish bull-fighting, are a sign of barbarity. But a specialized sport|is a sign of development. Alexei Alexandrovich!|How do you do. There are two sides to it:|performers and viewers. And love for such spectacles is an unmistakable proof|of a low degree of development. I agree with those|who hold... My favorite! No, I shan't come again.|It gets me too upset. Don't you think so, Anna? Vronsky! Makhotin! Milord fell back on the saddle during|a jump and broke Frou-Frou's spine. Stiva!|What happened? Vronsky was not hurt. I repeat my offer to give you my arm|if you wish to go. No! Leave me alone!|I want to stay. Once again l'm offering you|my arm. I promise to take Anna home. Excuse me, Princess, but I see|that Anna is not feeling well, and I wish her to come home with me. She is pining away.|And the whole town's talking. How much we are attracted|to these cruel spectacles! - L've noticed that...|- What? I don't understand. l'm obliged to tell you... Indecent?|What was indecent about my conduct? What did you consider indecent? The despair that you weren't able|to hide when one of the riders fell. It maybe that l'm mistaken? No, you are not mistaken. You're not at all mistaken. I am desperate|and I can't help being desperate. I am listening to you|but thinking of him. I am... I am in love with him. l'm his mistress. I can't bear you, l'm afraid of you, I abhor you. Do whatever you like with me. - What is it?|- A message from the Karenins'. I was told to give it to you|immediately. You met him?|And he bowed to you like this? I thought he was at a Council meeting. He was at the Council but came back. If only he broke with you!|This situation can't go on. You're not angry with me?|I absolutely had to talk to you. I had to tell you that I had told|Alexei Alexandrovich everything. That I couldn't be his wife any|longer... everything. Yes, it's a thousand times easier|that way. That was the only thing I wanted,|to clear up this situation. I realize how hard it must have been|for you. No, it wasn't hard at all.|It happened by itself. Today he left a letter for me. He writes that we have no right|to sever the ties which bind us... that our life will have to go on|as before. l'm so glad! Because things simply cannot go on|the way he suggests. And Seryozha?|He knows I won't leave my son. I cannot live without my son|even if l'm with the man I love. I hope that now|you will leave him and let me think about the future,|about organizing our life. Which is better-to leave your son, or to go on living|in this humiliating situation? - Humiliating for whom?|- Most of all, for you. You say it's humiliating. No, believe me, for me only one thing|has any meaning-your love. If I have your love,|I feel so exalted that nothing can possibly humiliate me. Because l'm proud of the situation|l'm in, l'm proud of... Anna, can't you get a divorce? Isn't it possible to take your son|and leave your husband? No. Let's not talk about it any more. Everything will be settled soon. Do not interrupt me! l'm going to die.|And l'm very glad of it. I will release you all. What nonsense you are talking! No, no, it's true.|I had a dream. I ran into my bedroom|and there was something in the corner. It turned around|and I saw it was a peasant. He was small and frightening,|with a disheveled beard. He bent over a sack,|fumbling in it for a long time, and he spoke in French,|talking very fast... I tried to wake up but I couldn't. And he said: 'In childbirth,|you will die in childbirth.' What utter nonsense!|How can you believe that? Is Anna Arkadyevna in her room? Anna Arkadyevna is giving a lesson|to Sergey Alexeyevich. What do you want? - Seryozha, leave the room.|- Wait. - Good morning, papa.|- Leave the room. - What do you want?|- Your lover's letters. They're not here.|Let go. What are you doing? Sit down.|I must speak to you. I won't tolerate your receiving|your lover in my house. I had to see him to... I don't want to be told why a woman|meets her lover. l've never known this cruel streak|in you. You call cruelty the husband's right|to demand observance of decency? That is cruelty? It's worse than cruelty.|It's baseness. No! Baseness is to leave a husband and|son for your lover and still eat your husband's bread. l'II take the needed steps|to put an end to this situation. You cannot imagine|my situation any worse than I feel it to be myself. It will come to an end by itself|very soon. It will come to an end sooner than you and your lover have planned. You are merely interested in|gratifying your bestial lust. The suffering of someone|who was your husband fails to interest you. You don't care that his life|has been ruined... and that he's... he's... miserable. I can change nothing.|Nothing. I came here to tell you... l've come to tell you that|tomorrow l'II be leaving for Moscow and that I shall not return to this|house. You'II be advised of my decision|by the lawyer to whom I shall entrust|the obtainment of a divorce. My son will go to my sister's. You want to take Seryozha|only to make me suffer. You don't love him. Leave me Seryozha...|Leave him to me. True, I have lost my love for my son, because he is... associated with...|the repulsion I feel for you. But l'II keep him all the same.|Goodbye. Alexei Alexandrovich, please,|leave me Seryozha! At least until I... l'm going to have a child soon.|Leave him. Ah, Alexei Alexandrovich! Good to see you.|Have you been in Moscow long? That wasn't nice,|You might have let me know. I really had no time.|l've had a lot to do. Come tomorrow for dinner. l'II treat you to the Moscow|intelligentsia. You'II meet Lyovin. - And how is my dear Anna?|- Anna Arkadyevna is well. Please come! You can't imagine|how very sorry l'd feel if you didn't. And so would my wife. Stiva! Papa! I must buy coats for Grisha|and Tanya. l'II need some money. Ah yes, of course...|Well, tell them l'II pay later. Where are you going? To Yeliseyev's. I heard|they've just received fresh oysters. Before I begin to|set forth my business, I should like to point out that this|whole matter is to be confidential. I wouldn't be a barrister|if I could not keep secrets. Do you know my name? I know you|and the valuable work you're doing. You are known to the whole Russia. I have the misfortune|to be a deceived husband, and I want to legally break off|relations with my wife, to divorce her, but in such a way that my son|shall not remain with his mother. You are asking for my help|in obtaining a divorce? Yes. L'd like to be familiarized|with the forms in which this type of affair|is consummated in actual practice. Divorce, according to our laws,|is possible in following cases... l'm busy! I said wait! Physical incapacity of the spouses|and adultery. Included here are|adultery committed by husband or wife, a physical defect of either husband|or wife. There is no physical defect,|I may assume? Adultery of one of the spouses... and the detection of the guilty party|by mutual agreement. The most usual, simple|and sensible course I consider to be adultery|detected by mutual consent. I think this is the case|of accidental detection, substantiated by letters|which I have in my possession. Cases of that kind are|under ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The reverend fathers, however,|are fond of going... into the minutest details|in such cases. They may require confirmation|by eyewitnesses to prove the fact of adultery. If you wish to entrust me|with your confidence... If one wants the result,|one must accept the means. Very well... I will communicate|my decision to you by letter. The artichokes!|And soupe 'Marie-Louise'! And the orange punch?|It's my own invention. In our Kaluga estate, the peasants have spent everything|they had on drink. Now they have nothing|with which to pay us. Konstantin Dmitrievich,|do explain it to us. You know everything, and you're|always defending the mouzhiks. l'm sorry, I know nothing about it,|so I can't say anything. We haven't seen each other|for such a long time. Though I saw you once.|It was one evening at sunset. For one fleeting moment you appeared|in the window of a carriage. - What were you thinking about then?|- I don't remember. It's a vicious circle, gentlemen. Women are deprived of rights|for lack of education. Absolutely correct. The point is whether women are|capable of assimilating these rights. As well as responsibilities. I think they are.|Women are so special... Have you heard about Pryachnikov? He fought in a duel with Kvitsky|and killed him with one bullet. Why was he dueling? Because of his wife. He challenged|him and killed him. Acted like a man. You're not leaving already? Yes. I must apologize|for having to leave. There's something I must speak to you|about. Please, come in here. Where are you going? L'II go with you. To see a ballet. But first|I have to pay a visit backstage. The main thing is to preserve|the sanctity of the home. So little harm is done...|and so much pleasure gained. I know...|It's none of my business. But I love and respect Anna. What is wrong between you two?|What has she done? She has slighted her duties and deceived her husband. Please, do anything you want with her,|but not divorce. We must get out|of the humiliating position in which we are placed. We can't live as a trio. And if you leave her,|what'II become of her? It'II be the end of her.|Have you thought about it? I have.|I have thought a great deal about it. Anna and sin.|It's impossible! It's inconceivable! I can't believe it! I would pay dearly for being able|to harbor doubts. But is it possible to harbor doubts|when a wife confesses to her husband her infidelity? When I doubted,|I had hope. Now there's no hope,|yet I still doubt everything. l'm in such doubt|that I even hate my son. At times I even doubt if he's my son. I am very unhappy. I understand you so well! I understand you, but listen,|l'd like to tell you my story. I got married|and my husband deceived me. I was so angry, so jealous|that I wanted to leave him. But I stopped in time.|It was Anna who saved me. I am living on, the children are|growing up. My husband feels his fault,|and is growing purer, better. I live on. I have forgiven him.|You have to forgive too. I cannot forgive. Nor do I wish to. I regard it as wrong. I did everything for her. And she has trampled it in the mud. I am not a spiteful man.|I never... hated anyone. But I hate her|with every single fiber of my being. I hate her so much|that I can't even forgive her for all the wrong... she has done me. But Anna is very ill.|Her condition is dangerous. l'm terrified when I think of|what might happen. I implore you, Alexei Alexandrovich,|go to her... Go to her. Kitty, wait. I... l've wanted to ask you something|for a long time. You may ask me now. That day we skated together you said:|'It's impossible.' Does that mean... I understand. Does that mean... - What is this word?|- Ne-ver. Yes, never. That's not true any more.|It was only true then. - Only then?|- Yes. And now? Now I would say...|I would like... you... to forget... Yes... and forgive... I... I... I have never... ceased...|Ioving... you... Thank you. Yes, yes...|I have never ceased loving you. Make haste! How is Madame? Safely delivered yesterday afternoon. - How is she?|- Very poorly. The doctors held a consultation|yesterday. Take my bags. Who is here? The doctor, the midwife|and Count Vronsky. - Send to the pharmacy for morphine.|- Right away, Doctor. Good morning,|Your Excellency. Alexei Alexandrovich... Alexei Alexandrovich...|she's going to die. The doctors say|there's no hope. l'm completely at your mercy.|But permit me to remain here. Though, of course, l'II do as you say... Give me some water. Oh, no. I think it's bad...|for my little girl. All right, I agree.|Get her a nurse. When he comes,|it will hurt him to see her. He's a kind man.|He doesn't realize how kind he is. Why isn't he coming?|Oh God, what a torture! Take all these coats off me!|Take them off, please. Has Seryozha been given his dinner?|You all forget, but he wouldn't have. Anna Arkadyevna, he has arrived.|Here he is. What nonsense!|You say he won't forgive. You don't know him.|No one knows. I alone know. No, no... l'm not afraid of you! l'm afraid... of death. Alexei... come closer to me. I must make haste. There's not|much time left for me to live. Soon l'II be too sick|to know anything. Wait, wait...|Yes, yes, yes... That's what I wanted to tell you. l'm still the same.|But there's someone else in me! I wanted to hate you but could not forget the one|I had been before. She is not me. The real me|is the one you see now. All of me. l'm dying now.|I know l'm going to die. I only want one thing...|Will you... forgive me? You must forgive me, completely. No, it's impossible!|I know you can't forgive me that. No! Go away!|You're too perfect. Why...|Why doesn't he come? How strange that they should|both be called Alexei. Yes... he has come! I knew it... Farewell now.|Farewell to all. Come here!|Uncover your face. Look at him! He... he's a saint. Uncover your face. Alexei Alexandrovich,|do uncover his face. I want to... to see him... Shake hands with him. Forgive him, please. Thank God...|Thank God. That wallpaper is so horrid! If I could only stretch my legs.|Oh God! When will this all be over? Alexei Alexandrovich... l'm unable to speak,|unable to... think. Please, have mercy! No matter how great your suffering is,|mine is even worse. Sit down and hear me out.|It's necessary. I have to explain to you my feelings, so that there will be no|misunderstandings concerning me. I had decided on a divorce|and started the proceedings. I admit I was beset by|thoughts of revenge. When I received the telegram,|I came here with the same feelings. I will say even more:|I longed for her death. But then... I saw her and forgave her. I have forgiven her completely. l'm willing to turn the other cheek. l'm ready to give away my shirt|since my coat has been taken. I pray to God not to deprive me|of the joy of forgiveness. Such is my position. You can make me the laughing-stock|of society... but I will not abandon her|should God Almighty grant her life. I must remain with her,|and I will. If she wishes to see you,|I will notify you. At the present time, however,|I believe you'd better leave. Yes, yes, of course. Of course. God's servant, Konstantin, plights his|troth to God's servant, Yekaterina. In the name of the Father, the Son,|and the Holy Ghost. God's servant, Yekaterina, plights her|troth to God's servant, Konstantin. In the name of the Father, the Son,|and the Holy Ghost. We praise Thee, most merciful God! I hereby join in holy union|Konstantin and Yekaterina. In the name of the Father, the Son,|and the Holy Ghost. Joined in holy wedlock are thy|servants, Yekaterina and Konstantin. In the name of the Father, the Son,|and the Holy Ghost. Almighty God, crown them with glory|and with honour. He's not worth her little finger,|don't you think so? - How is Count Vronsky?|- How is his wound? He is recovering,|and planning to go to Tashkent. Rejoice, oh Isaiah! A telegram. - Who's there?|- Princess Tverskaya. One may regard one and the same thing|either in a tragic or comic light. I don't know whether l'm better or|worse than anyone else. If he weren't going so far away, I would have understood your own|and your husband's refusal. I refuse for my own sake,|not for my husband's. I beg you, let's stop talking|about it. But surely you must want|to say goodbye to a man who tried to take his own life|for you. That's exactly why I don't want to.|Let's not talk about it. l'm so glad you're at home! I haven't seen you|since Anna's illness. l've heard what good care you took|of her. You're an amazing husband! We've been chatting too long.|I really must be going now. Wait!|I must tell you... I mean, to you... I can't and I don't want to have|any secrets from you. Count Vronsky is leaving for Tashkent,|and he would like to say goodbye to us. I said I could not see him. You said that was for Alexei|Alexandrovich to decide. No, I said|that I wouldn't receive him. There would be no point in it.|I just don't want to. I know you are a truly|generous man. I love Anna and respect you so much that I venture to offer advice:|do receive him. Vronsky is the soul of honour,|and he's leaving for Tashkent... Thank you, Princess,|for your sympathy and advice. But only my wife can decide|whom she should or should not receive. A telegram from your brother.|He's coming to Petersburg. - I haven't the time to meet him...|- Yes, I know. L'II go. I agree that there's no need for Count Vronsky to come here.|However, if... l've told you already.|Why do I need to repeat it? Let's not talk about it anymore. I left the decision up to you,|and l'm very glad to see... That my wishes coincide with your own? Yes. The Princess shouldn't meddle in|others' complicated family affairs. Especially since... - But I don't blame anyone.|- Yes, you do! What has she done to you?|Why didn't I die? Oh, I wish I were dead! L'm sorry,|l'm unstrung, but... do go away! Go away! Go away! I can't live with him anymore.|I can't bear the sight of him. They say women love men|even for their vices. But I hate him|because he's so virtuous. You married without love,|or without knowing love. That was a grave mistake. I seem to be falling down the abyss,|and there's nothing left to do but... You are giving in to pessimism,|you must pull yourself together. Believe me, you're exaggerating|things. No, Stiva, l'm lost. L'm lost. l'm like a string stretched too tight. The string can be loosened|little by little. There's always a way out|of every situation. Yes, you're right! There's no sense|in lying to myself any more. l'm still alive and it's not my fault.|Let come what may. Anything is better than deceit.|We'II go to Italy. Alone, to live like man and wife. - What is it?|- Oh, nothing, really. I just wanted you|to turn round. I made a wish and it worked. What were you thinking about? Just wondering how l'd cut out|these little holes. What were you thinking about? Tell me. About my work. Many things... l'm so glad of the chance|to be alone with you. - Are you happy?|- Yes, l'm happy. But l'm dissatisfied with myself. Why? How can you be dissatisfied|and happy at the same time? I want nothing for myself,|but I have always envied people whose whole lives are subordinated|to duty. When I compare myself to them,|I see l'm not worth much. Why?|Aren't you doing enough for others? With your work on the estate?|With your writing? No, no. I don't do any of it|as I should. I do it as though it were a lesson|assigned to me. l'm pretending. And all the time|l'm thinking of death. Of course, it's all nonsense,|but come to think of it. Our world is just a little mould,|that has grown on our tiny planet. And we imagine|we can achieve great things. Oh, l'm sorry, l'm so very happy I|don't think I can understand anything. - Won't you be tired?|- No. Stay out of the sun. We're going for a little walk. Kitty, you mustn't walk too much|in your condition. Why don't you try our method|with this jam? Just cover the jar with a piece|of paper soaked in rum. It'II never get moldy. l'II try it.|Anyhow, our way of pickling is considered the best|anywhere around these parts. Verse number forty-eight. 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is|in Heaven is perfect.' - I hope you understand that?|- Yes, papa. Is it true that you got|a new decoration? Are you glad? First, will you stop rocking? And second,|what counts is work, not the reward. When you work, you must love|what you do. And your work will be your reward. Yes, papa. Did you get the Alexander Nevsky|order? - Is there something higher?|- Vladimir. - And still higher?|- Saint Andrew. And higher than that? You are far too young|to be interested in these things. l've asked you to stop rocking. Now name the patriarchs|who lived before the Flood. Enos... Enoch...|Then Methuselah... - Jared... Enos...|- You've already named Enos. It's bad that you don't try to learn the things which are the most|important for a Christian. I must punish you. l'm leaving now, and you're forbidden|to go for a walk as usual. The nurse said that my mama isn't|really dead. Is it true? She's dead... She's dead... for you. 'I haven't seen him for such a long|time. l'm so unhappy being separated|from my son. l'm imploring you for permission|to see him, if only just once. l'm turning to you|and not to Alexei Alexandrovich, only because I do not want|that generous man to suffer. Knowing of your friendship with him,|l'm sure you'II understand me. Will you send Seryozha to me or should I come to the house|when you tell me to?' I have received a letter from her.|She is here, in Petersburg. Oh, I congratulate you! Lydia Ivanovna has taken Karenin under her special protection. The Countess has never stopped|being in love with someone: a prince, the Metripolitan,|now it's Karenin. He came straight|from the Winter Palace where the Czar was congratulating|those who've been decorated. She asks me to assist her in arranging a meeting|with your son... our little angel. I do not believe|that I have the right to refuse her. You never see evil in anyone. I see evil everywhere,|but would it be fair? There is a limit to everything. And if you ask my advice... l'd advise you not to do it. Without any hesitation I wouldn't|advise it. With your permission...|l'II answer her letter. All we may do is pray to Almighty God|to have mercy on her. Madame? I want to see Seryozha...|Sergey Alexeyevich. Let me take a look. He's waking up. Madame is here? Seryozha! It's me. Come here. Mama! Seryozha, my darling! Today is my birthday.|I knew you'd come. Mama, why are you crying? I won't cry.|l'm crying forjoy. I haven't seen you for such a long|time. Now, you must get dressed. Yes. Only I don't wash with cold|water. Papa said not to. You're sitting on my clothes. My darling, you didn't believe|I was dead? I never believed it,|mama darling! Don't go away, he's not coming yet. My darling!|My blessed little monkey! You won't forget me? Don't go. He won't come. My baby, love your father.|I did him a terrible wrong. When you're older, you'II understand. He's kinder than I am, and better. No! I don't want to! Mama! Darling mama!|No one is better than you! Mama! Mama! You know how fond I am of Anna.|Don't think l'm condemning her. But she simply doesn't understand|her situation. I cannot receive her.|I can't change the world. I know she won't be received|in court circles. But our close friends,|they can and they must understand. She might meet people in my house|who take a different view of things. You'II be snubbed by them. No, as long as her situation remains...|irregular... I simply cannot receive her.|Don't be angry with me. I see... Please understand it's not my fault. But l'm pained all the more because this ends our friendship, too. You will understand that for me|there can be no other way. Are you really going to the theatre? Why shouldn't I?|l've wanted to hear Patti for so long. Why do you ask in such a frightened|tone? After all, there isn't any reason|not to go... l'm not going alone. Yashvin|won't be a compromising escort. Anna, what's wrong with you? - What do you mean?|- You know you can't go. Why? You're busy.|You can stay at home. - Don't you realize that...|- No! And I don't want to! - But you must understand...|- I don't care to! For us, only one thing counts:|whether we love each other or not. There can be no other consideration. Why can't I go to the theatre? I love you|and there's nothing else that matters. Why aren't you looking at me? You know my feelings for you|will never change. But l'm begging you not to go. And I beg you to give me one good|reason why I should not. Alyosha! Why do you come so late? What a shame!|Madame Kartasova had no right... - What did she do?|- She insulted Madame Karenina. Go on, Maman is waiting. No one can ever see you anymore. Madame Karenina|is creating a sensation. So much so they're forgetting Patti. - I asked you not to speak in this...|- I only say what everyone's saying. l'm so glad you're going to meet her. Even though she's my sister,|I can say outright that she's... a remarkable woman. You'II see for yourself. Her position in society is horrid!|Her situation's hell. And there's no hope of its changing. - Why?|- It's a long and boring story. First her husband, then she,|refused the divorce. Now they live in the country. Another woman would have lost|courage long ago, but she... You'II see how she's organized her|life, how calm she is. She has a daughter. She must be|quite busy with her. You think every woman is just|another brood hen, don't you? If a woman is busy at all,|it can only be with children. - Give us some work, sir.|- No, I have nothing for you. - Where do you come from?|- From far away. - Why did you come here?|- In search of work. No, we don't have anything.|Only enough for our own peasants. - Well, God bless you.|- Goodbye, sir. Hard as their work is,|they haven't enough of it. I admit there's much injustice|in the world. Yes, it's true,|I do feel it but... You won't give up what is yours|to them. How can I do that? But you're convinced|that it is unjust. I always feel the injustice|of my being so much richer than them. But I have my responsibilities|to the land, to my family, and to society as well. You see?|And I think you must either admit that|the existing order is just and defend your rights, or acknowledge that you're enjoying|unjust privileges, and then take pleasure in them. I cannot enjoy them when I see how poor my people are,|and know that it's unjust. Well, then, don't enjoy them. I feel l've long known and loved you|because of your friendship with Stiva and because of your lovely wife. But if she can't forgive me|my situation, I hope she would never be able|to forgive me. To forgive, one must go through it...|l'm not trying to prove something. I only want to live and not harm|anyone... excepting me. I have a right to that,|haven't I? Once a peasant told me:|'All people are different. One lives solely for his needs,|another for the salvation of his soul. He remembers the Lord.' To live not for what attracts you,|but for a God that no one can understand|or define. Do you think l'm living? L'm not. Alexei can go|wherever and whenever he likes. He has every right, I have none. A great many couples stay for years|in the same old rut that is hated by both husband and|wife simply because there's neither strife|nor happiness between them. For me to be happy, I must have with me|both my son and Alexei. I love both of them equally,|and both more than myself. If I can't have them both,|then nothing matters. Nothing matters. That's the eternal mistake|of imagining happiness as a fulfilled desire. And what if all we have to look|forward to is suffering, doubt and endless|dissatisfaction with oneself? One cannot live then. One must eitherjustify his life|to himself or... A number of times I have been close|to suicide. I hid the rope,|so I wouldn't hang myself. I was afraid of carrying a gun about|lest I should shoot myself. I am saved from despair|by love alone. Do I regret anything? No. If I had to live my life over,|l'd do the same thing, because I love and l'm loved...|No. To live... to live! You fell in love with that vile woman! She has bewitched you,|I see it in your eyes. I shall die...|Why did you marry me? Why?|You would be free now. Go away! Kitty, I beg of you... Stop it...|Kitty, please... At what time? - You're going away?|- Yes. - Today?|- Yes. L'm going to Kashin. We have to elect|The Marshal of the Nobility. - I hope you won't feel Ionely.|- I hope I won't. I received a box of books|from Gautier's. - Will you be gone long?|- A few days. Oh, no... l'II have to take a trip to Moscow. Well, if you have to go to Moscow,|l'II come too. - L'm only going for a few days.|- L'II go for a few days too. I won't stay here all alone. Either we should separate|or we should live together. l'd like to be with you always, but I have obligations towards|my friends, towards society. I understand.|But I shall go to Moscow too. That sounds like a threat.|Let's not talk about it anymore. - Why not?|- I must have some occupation! Socially you have already got|far too many occupations. You're a member of six public bodies:|you're a counselor, a juryman... You've got so many obligations|that it looks like a farce. Why are you so irritable, Anna? No... I can't live like that! You've grown tired of me,|l'm a burden to you. You must not despair. Your sorrow is great,|but you must find consolation. I am crushed, annihilated.|I am no longer a man. I cannot find the strength|to support me. Christ's love|is our support. - I am weak. I am crushed.|- My dear friend... I foresaw nothing|and now I understand nothing. It's not the loss I have sustained. I have no regrets. But the humiliation|I suffer before people because of my situation. It is wrong, but I cannot help it. Ask Him to help you. Only in Him we will find comfort,|deliverance and love. And now for practical matters. Such things are not my strong point, but I will be your housekeeper. And now l'm going to tell Seryozha|that his father is a saint. And how is your poor sister? Give her my love. She was so right in leaving|that half-wit husband of hers. Everyone claimed he's such a clever|man. l'm the only one who said he's a fool. That one was close! And now that he got mixed up|with that stupid Lydia Ivanovna and that dimwit Landau, everybody realizes how right I was. This one'II be a miss. l've never heard of him. We don't know about him in Moscow. You haven't heard of Jules Landau?|It's because you live in the province. Just another insane man. Lydia Ivanovna brought him|to Petersburg from Paris. - He is treating her husband.|- With no success. Yesterday I asked Karenin to give me|an answer on behalf of my sister. Instead I got an invitation|from Lydia Ivanovna. You will meet Jules Landau there. Now your sister's fate|depends on that Landau. Is it true that Monsieur Landau|has cured Countess Bezukhov? Completely. - Is he going to Paris?|- Yes, he heard a voice. - What did he hear?|- A voice. Oh, a voice... I observe that Moscow people,|particularly men, are utterly indifferent|to religion. As I can see, you, unfortunately,|are one of the indifferent ones. Have you read 'Happy Because Safe|From Harm'? No. Give me your word|that you will read it. It points the way to faith and the happiness|that faith brings. He is asleep. Give him your hand, my friend,|and you will see, you will hear... What did he say?|I couldn't make it out. Come back at 10 o'clock.|Or even better, tomorrow. Oh, did he speak of me? Do not admit anyone. Countess, Alexei Alexandrovich|wanted to inform me of his decision|about divorcing my sister. The answer is quite clear. He heard a voice. - What did he hear?|- A voice. Ah, yes, a voice! Help me, Almighty Father... - Did you have a good time?|- Same as usual. Wasn't it interesting?|Who was there? The usual Moscow set... The Kourakins,|Maman and Princess Sorokin... The girl your mother was so anxious|to have you marry? Oh, that's good!|When do you want to leave for Moscow? I shan't be ready by tomorrow.|The day after. No... the day after tomorrow|l've got to go to Maman's. Couldn't you go there tomorrow? The money l'm going for|won't be ready by tomorrow. If that's how it is, we shan't go|at all. - Why not?|- L'm not going later than Monday. It's Monday or never! But why?|It makes no sense. Because you don't care about me! You can't understand|what my life is like. But there are necessities|with which we must comply. You always boast of your uprightness,|so why don't you tell the truth? You should know I never have boasted. And I always tell the truth. I wish you could learn to respect... Respect... respect... Respect was invented|to cover up the empty space left by the absence of love. Actually, if you no longer love me, it would be more honest to say so. Oh! It's getting intolerable! Why do you try my patience?|It has limits! What do you mean by that? I don't understand|what you mean by that. I mean to say... What do you want of me, exactly?|Tell me. What do I want?|What can I want? Only that you should not desert me|as you wish to do. I want love, and there is none. So then... it's over? It's finished! Oh, there's a limit|to a man's endurance! Wait! Has Madame finished her dinner? Anna, we'II leave the day after|tomorrow, if you want. Leave me! Who am I?|I am a depraved woman. l'II go tomorrow. L'II give you your|freedom. I don't want to torment you. You don't love me!|You love someone else! Anna, why do you torture me|and torture yourself? If you only knew|how desperate I feel! l'm so afraid... l'm afraid of myself! What must I do|to make you happy? Good morning. It's from Stiva... about the divorce. He hasn't been able to get a reply|from Alexei Alexandrovich. There's little hope,|but he'II do whatever he can. I wish you cared as little about it|as I do. This interests me because|I like things to be definite. It's not form but love|that makes things definite. Why do you want it so much? l'm certain that your irritability|comes largely from the indefiniteness of our situation. That's not the reason. l'm entirely at your mercy. There's nothing indefinite about it.|On the contrary. The indefiniteness consists|in your assuming l'm free. Oh, don't let that worry you.|Let me reassure you. l'm not interested in what marriage|your mother may be plotting for you. - But that's beside the point!|- That's exactly the point! Anyone who is heartless,|whether she's your mother or a stranger,|doesn't deserve my attention. Anna, I ask you not to speak|disrespectfully of my mother. A woman|who can't feel in her heart where the happiness of her son|may lie, has no heart. I ask you once more not to speak so|of my mother whom I respect. You don't love your mother!|It's only words! - So we're definitely going tomorrow?|- You are. I am not. Anna, we can't go on living like this. You'II regret this, believe me. Anna! I had to make up my mind.|I know what to do! I am so glad to see you. I should not have been surprised|if you refused to see me. I am accustomed to it.|I came to say goodbye. Are you going away? l've heard so much about you,|from your husband too. He paid me a visit.|I liked him very much. - Where is he?|- He... he's gone to the country. I liked him immensely. Be sure to remember me to him. Of course. Why all these churches?|These bells? These lies? Only to hide the fact|that we hate each other. My love grows|more passionate and egoistic, while his is waning|and that can't be helped. I don't know these streets.|So many houses... So many people in them... No end of them,|and everyone hating everyone else. Aren't we all thrown into this world|only to hate each other, and then torture each other? No, no, it can't go on. We are growing apart. I make him unhappy, he makes me|unhappy. Nothing but lies and falsehood... All is deceit, all... evil... T H E E N D
