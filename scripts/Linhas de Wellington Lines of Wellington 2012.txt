The French had no difficulty reaching the centre of the country where the Anglo-Portuguese army, led by General Wellington, awaited them. For RAL RUIZ who prepared this film Director Original Screenplay and Dialogues Director of Photography Art Director Production Manager Original Music LINES OF WELLINGTON Leave that crap alone, you imbecile! It's covered in blood! On the slopes of Buaco, despite the many natural obstacles that favoured the defence of Alcoba, our valiant men of the Second battalion battled to the summit, after one hour of extraordinary efforts. They arrived, breathless, at the ridge of the mountain, only to be met by the full force of the English artillery. Marechal Massena made a terrible mistake, sending the Second battalion into action before the Sixth were ready to intervene. Our men greeted the French with a musket volley at fifteen paces. Five hundred Jacobins stopped dead in their tracks. General Wellington advanced heavy reinforcements, forcing the French to fall back... We chased them down the slopes with our musket fire, which they could ill return, and scythed them down like ripened wheat... If I had my way, they wouldn't even bury their whoring mothers. Don't be so harsh, Chico! They're Christians after all... Christians, my foot! They're all Jews, Z. Sergeant? They can't all be. Those who're not, are freemasons or the like. Bunch of Jacobins! If they want a decent burial, they should've stayed in their own damned country! Right, lads! Come on! Let's get back to the English encampment, we've earned it. The Jacobins lost above five thousand men. A general and two hundred and fifty officers among the dead, wounded or captured. Come on! Halt, halt! D. Pedro! Lieutenant, Sir! It's no use, Sergeant. He can't hear you. - What's wrong with him? - Two musket balls to the head. He's more dead than alive, we should have left him. - Are you a doctor? - No, Sergeant. Then hold your tongue. What's your name? Eusbio, Sergeant. Noted, Eusbio. I never forget a name. If he dies before he sees the doctor, I'll cut your throat. Off you go! - Who was that? - Lieutenant Alencar. Well? He's not yet twenty... Sergeant! Damn, Sergeant, you! I saw it. You shot him, didn't you? The French General! It was you, I saw it you rogue! I couldn't swear it was me, Major. I had him in my sights. And took the shot. You didn't kill him though, you ninny. We took him alive. A bit buggered, but alive. Want to see him? I'd better not, if you'll pardon me, sir. The devil might tempt me to finish him off... You can't forgive them, eh? Not in this world, or the next. Tell me, Chico, have you seen Corporal Percy about? No, nor will I, Major. He fell at my side. He's still down there. Careful what you say. His wife's waiting for him. They've not been married a year... Damned Jacobins! Tell her. Go on. Me, Major? Yes, you. You saw him last, didn't you? Well? Tell her. Poor girl has a right to know what happened. - In what language, sir? - You choose. She'll understand, don't worry. Go! That's an order, Sergeant. Percy? Come. Come with me. I'm... I'm a friend! Friend of Percy. Corporal Percy, today... Corporal Percy! To see, him. It's not a good idea. He not pretty. To see... not good... Yes. But not today. Tomorrow. I'll take you. Yes? Tomorrow... Yes. Tomorrow. I'm Francisco Xavier. Chico. I'll see you tomorrow. Who's that? Martrio! Leave me be... Go on, shoo. What're you doing here? The Major sent me... There's a girl asleep next door. Don't make a noise, go away. Stop it, you'll wake the girl. I won't wake anyone if you'd shut up, you dolt. All right. Quietly, quietly. Come here. Quietly. Oh damn! What is it? I left my purse in my cloak. Don't worry, the Major paid. Thank you. I had to explain to that fool Z Maria why we had to retreat although we'd won. It was hard to grasp that the bastard French, even in defeat, far outnumbered the English and us. We could only beat them again on favourable ground, like in Buaco... That's what I think our General Wellington will do farther to the south where I come from, where it's more hilly... Meanwhile, I can't stop thinking about Corporal Percy's death and his poor wife, Maureen, alone without solace in a foreign land where she doesn't speak the language. Fewer dead! More heroes! As if today's dead weren't tomorrow's heroes. Our troops reached Coimbra on October 1st. The wretched inhabitants of that great and beautiful city of one hundred and twenty thousand souls were told of the enemy's imminent arrival, and ordered to abandon their homes. It's path blocked by the sheer volume of refugees, Wellington's army fell back in disarray on the road to Pombal. Get these flea traps out of here! Come on, hurry up! To our amazement, rather than seizing the advantage to rout the enemy, General Massena decided to stay in Coimbra to "regroup"and "treat the wounded"... What's going on? Where are we? In Hades, my friend... The French. They're here. The French?! Already? They'll garrote us all. Flee if you can. Hide! I won't get far with no legs... Captain, sir... I can't leave you here. Don't be an ass. You can and must. Flee! Flee while you can! As for me, French or no French I haven't got long. I can't say I even want the time I have left... - Go. Hurry. Get away! - No, no, Captain, sir! Go! Don't waste time. Get going! The window! The window. Shit! He can't have got far... From behind, it looked like a woman. Don't tell me this old fool's still here! Fuck off, messieurs. For the Marechal and his retinue we were fortunate to find intact the magnificent palace of a Swiss merchant. Being a friend of the French, he gave up his last Guinea fowl for the Marechal's dinner... I knew your Voltaire well, you know... Knew him! You exaggerate, my poor Lopold. Say rather, you imagined him... - You remember my dear, at Ferney! - Yes, at Ferney! Don't you remember? And from far away. - Only a few metres... - Yes, more or less... With his back to you. More wine, Monsieur le Marchal? I'm afraid it's not Bourgogne... They say it's a little rough... Myself, I hardly drink. No! Are you sure, Cosima? Really!? - A hussar? - Absolutely, Severina. Like Papa... But, sister dear... there's only one bed in the room! The French, you know... What? Know what? What are you talking about? Nothing. I'm afraid we have nothing for dessert. The servants took everything. We do, however, have a little French cognac... You're probably wondering, Monsieur le Marchal, why we stayed. My petal, I don't expect Monsieur is interested... Shut up. And don't call me petal. It's ridiculous. Our daughter is buried here. In the garden. Killed by a stray bullet on the Buaco road... She wasn't yet twenty. - Severina! - Come, sister! It was a French bullet. That was never confirmed, Monsieur le Marchal... - It could well have been English... - Or Portuguese... It was French. Grief has upset her, Monsieur. Don't take it amiss. They're an interesting race, the Portuguese, you know... A melancholy people... They call it "saudade": It's being sad for what didn't happen, but might have happened. They fall into long silences, in the middle of a conversation even, then take up again as if nothing were amiss. For them, coldness is merely a sort of inverted warmth. It's a pity they've all gone. Oh well, I dare say they'll be back... Don't be scared. I'm not French. I won't hurt you. Who are you? What are you doing here?! I think that is for me to ask, my young friend. I'm the mistress of this house. At least I was last time I checked. I beg your pardon, madam. I'm terribly sorry. Believe me. I had nowhere else to go. Lieutenant Pedro de Alencar. Pleased to meet you... despite the circumstances. My name is Filipa Sanches. Forgive my asking, but how did you get in? The door downstairs was open... Really! What blockheads! They must have left it open when they fled. I didn't think to check... Luckily St Christopher watches over me. Well... There's a dressing gown in there that should fit. And slippers. I'll be in the next room. The slippers were too small... When I saw you come in, I took you for one of the French deserters hereabouts. I've seen them in the square below since everyone left... - Lemon or milk? - Milk, please. If I may...? Imagine, I thought you'd come to rape me! When I heard you talking in your sleep, I realized you were Portuguese. I spoke? A few words of no importance. Mother... Water... French... My head... Careful! I think that's all. Relax, you didn't give away any military secrets. But tell me, Lieutenant, what possessed you to wander about in your shirttails? I was in hospital when the French arrived and I had no time to get dressed. I was wounded at Buaco. In the head. Two bullets. They removed one, but couldn't get the other. How awful! You poor boy, does it hurt much? No, it hardly hurts at all now. But when the others were evacuated, I couldn't walk. The doctors thought I was in no fit state to go with them. But... what about you? Why didn't you leave with the others? Why should I leave? I'm in my own house, Lieutenant. I was fifteen when I first came here. My father brought me from Vigo, to give me away to my intended. I was married here. I gave birth to three children in that bed you slept in. And this is where I was widowed. So a handful of French antichrists won't see me off. If only they were just a handful... Were they a million, they'd couldn't get me out. Unless I was dead! What about your family? They let you stay? They didn't want to. They pressed me to leave. I hid in the attic. They had no choice but to go without me. Fear, Lieutenant, is a powerful force. Stronger, certainly, than any attachment to me. Here I am, prattling like an old whore, and you, Lieutenant, are dead tired. - No, absolutely not... - Yes, indeed you are. Don't contradict me! Come on, to bed! I'll show you to your room. Tomorrow, I'll find you something decent to wear and change that revolting bandage on your head. Come on, let's go. Manuel Pedro! Incio! Sozinha! Matias! Idalina! Father! Josefina! Antnia! Ermelinda! - I don't want to leave! - Come along! - Untie me! - Come away! Untie me! Antnio! Untie me! Untie me! You'll all burn in Hell! Untie me! Forgive my asking... But have you seen this lady? It's a good likeness. Painted by an Italian, a master from Milan... A true artist, very well known. Barilli. He was in Coimbra three years ago. It's just like her. She's my wife. I lost her in Pombal two days ago. I turned round and, poof, she was gone... I haven't seen her since... You haven't seen her, have you? No, sorry. Apart from the English, who told us to hurry, we haven't seen a soul. Come on! Perhaps your wife...? I don't think so. Her name's Maria de Jesus... Maria de Jesus de Almeida... I'm Vicente. De Almeida, naturally... If you do see her... If she does come through here... If you'd be so kind... tell her... ...that I'm looking for her. Vicente... Vicente de Almeida. Much obliged. Thank you. Pick them up. "I should like to tell you how I feel about the State which we have described... "I should like to tell you how I feel about the State which we have described... "I might compare myself to a person who, on beholding beautiful animals "either created by the painter's art, or, better still, alive but at rest, "is seized with a desire of seeing them in motion "or engaged in some struggle or conflict to which their forms appear suited..." Sergeant! Help them fix the wheel. The sight of those poor souls forced to flee by the accursed Jacobins, made my blood boil. As we mended the English girl's wagon, I thought of what would happen should the bastard French catch up with them before they reached safety. I wanted to smash something. The feeling grew when I thought that a defenseless lass like Maureen could suffer the same fate... Oh, dearest Major! I've dreamt of bathing like this for ages. From now on, ask what you will of me! I'll always serve you first. Don't lie, wench! I know full well Sergeant Xavier is your favourite... It depends. I'm not so set in my ways. You're my favourite tonight... ...my little gold charm. - He hasn't eaten since yesterday! - Let him be! All the more for us. We're small, Francisco Xavier... This Portugal of ours is a tiny gnat turd. If it weren't for the roast beefs, Bonaparte would have made mincemeat of us... You're an ass, Z Maria. You don't get it. Oh, don't I? What don't I get? You should realize, you ass, that Portugal and Napoleon are like it says in the Bible. Oh yeah?! What does it say in the bible? Well, in the bible... ...Napoleon is Goliath, and Portugal is King David. And the English? What are the English in this bible of yours? The English are the slingshot King David used to fell Goliath. You devil! Have you ever read the bible? No, never. But it was read to me. Off you go then, Martrio... I bid you ...a very good evening. What the...? What is it? It's me, Z Maria. Don't be afraid. Z Maria? What do you want? Martrio... Sweetheart... Give me one free. I only get my pay next week. I'm bursting...! I'll give you a smack round the head! Go away and let me sleep. You can keep your clothes on. Just a hand. And one breast out. Go away, you big baby. Shove off or I'll smack your face with it! All right. No hands. Just a breast. I'll do the rest. You can sleep if you want... What is it, sweetie?! You're shivering! - Are you ill? - No! It's the cold... fear... desire... Oh go on, then... Come and get warm. But leave me alone, you wretch. Do what you want, but let me sleep, I'm worn out... Good morning. Excuse me, but have you by any chance seen this lady? No sir. - Are you sure? - I haven't seen her. I'm sorry. Thank you. - Good day, friend. - Good day. - Perhaps I've already asked... - Yes, you have. I haven't seen her. - I'm sorry. I've asked so many people. - That's all right. Good morning. How much for the cape? Three hundred reis. - Has it got gold stitching? - I don't haggle. I'm no gypsy. Take it or leave it. Three hundred. Every day, two words. Today, first word... Second word... Rain! Cold! Then sick! No, it's not, not good. Besides, I found it. I didn't buy it. See? It didn't cost me a cent... You should've woken me, Dona Filipa. You shouldn't have let me sleep so long... Don't be silly. You were in pieces. You'd have dropped dead in a corner. How would I have disposed of your corpse on my own? Tell me that! I'm sure you'd have found a way... Keep still, or that bullet will pierce your brain and kill you for sure! I think they've gone. Perhaps. Well, gone or not, come nightfall I'll be on my way. What's the hurry? You're in no fit state to go rushing about. And besides, even if they have left, they won't have gone far. Where do you want to go? To the lines of Torres. - What in heaven are they?! - The lines of General Wellington. Dozens of fortifications, forts and redoubts to hold back the French, before Lisbon. I was quartered there when they were building them. I couldn't believe it Dona Filipa. They're huge! - Truly gigantic! - Yes, I see. Gigantic. But what will you do there? Fight the French, Dona Filipa. I'm a soldier. A soldier? You're a child. You barely can't stand. Isn't a bullet in the head enough for you? Quite the opposite. It's one more reason join the fight! Childish nonsense... Thank you, Dona Filipa. We struck camp and headed due south. They said it would be the last leg. It's rumoured we'd wait for the French around Torres Vedras, where I come from... No one knew anything for certain. I prayed it was true. I couldn't wait to get at the French! But I feared the English were preparing to embark for home from Lisbon, leaving us alone with the Jacobins hard on our heels... Who's there? Portuguese?! Yes... You? Bordalo. Poet. Ex-Jacobin. - You don't look it. - Poet or Jacobin? - Portuguese. - Looks aren't everything... You'd better get out of there before the French put a bullet in your head. You can say what you like. They're Poles. They don't understand a word. What are they doing here? Deserters. Fed up with the French and empty bellies. Like me. Why the clogs? Choice or necessity? They belong to a friend's gardener. Nothing else fit me... No shortage of footwear here. Come with me. Help yourself. Did you do this? Me and the Poles. Here. These should fit. Don't look down your nose, Lieutenant. Death's not catching. I enlisted two years ago, as soon as Junot reached Lisbon. I'd read Voltaire and Rousseau. Bonaparte was my hero. Liberty. Equality. Fraternity. Arise, children of the motherland... I couldn't wait to fight tyranny, to cut the throats of noblemen. Stick their heads on spikes. Drown the monarchy in a bloodbath. When the English routed them, the French took us along... We fought in Austria with Gomes Freire. In the Tyrol. Baumersdorf. Wagram. I won the Legion of Honour and lost my illusions. We killed more poor wretches like ourselves than noblemen... Enough! Of Liberty and Equality, I saw nothing. Fraternity was Napoleon sharing the thrones of Europe among his brothers. I crossed the border with Massena, then gave up... Deserted. I'd had my fill of blood and the rest. My only wish... ...is to see Alfama once more before they hang me in Campo de Sant'ana. It took us three days to reach the beautiful city of Pombal, the preserve of the famous Marquis of that name. The English evacuation of the local populace deprived us of vital resources we needed to sustain our troops. We had no cereal, vegetables or fodder. All our soldiers could find were grapes and lemons... not very substantial fare. I'm terribly sorry, Marechal. It's the only lodging left intact. They gutted the palace before fleeing. A bed and a roof. We are at war, are we not? We must content ourselves, sir. Absolutely. Thank you, sir. Monsieur de Sgur, would you join us this evening in a game of whist? Your wife, too, of course... I haven't had a chance to meet her yet, but they say she is a great beauty, despite being Portuguese. I'm sorry, my wife never socializes, madam. Never?! - Is it a vow? - In a way. What does the poor thing do alone in her room each evening? She prays, madam. Every night! Has she sinned so much? I believe, madam, that she prays for the sins of others. Well, isn't that wonderful. We shall expect to see you later this evening. Here you are, at last! Where have you been, you wretch? It's not my fault, madam... I swear, as God is my witness! They sent me to the other end of town. They? They who? Some soldiers, madam. I asked them for directions. They were making fun of me... I suppose you made it easy, you fat head! They looked quite respectable, how could I know they weren't? That will do. You're holding these gentlemen up. Yes. We should retire. Come, you can help me out of this damn tunic. No. I can do that. How much meat, Duke? BLOOD! BLOOD! Down with liberty! Hail the Virgin Mary! Devil take them. A gang of priests, that's all we need. He's Portuguese and a man of God. Vintm! Zanaga! Pacheco! Go and catch the Jacobin horses. Go! The worst possible combination! At least they didn't sell out to the French. If you mean me, I didn't sell out. There's another five here, Father! Still alive! - If they're alive, kill them! - Just a second, friends! We're on the same side. We're here to do what you did. You speak Portuguese?! Well? - They speak Portuguese, Father! - We are Portuguese. Kill them anyway! - They say they're Portuguese! - We're Portuguese, Father! We're with you! Bring them on down! - When did you lot lose the army? - A good week ago. The Lieutenant here escaped the French from a hospital in Coimbra three or four days ago. What's wrong with your head? A bullet, Father. French. What did I say, Brites? A Portuguese head is harder than a Jacobin's bullet. Did I or didn't I? You did. And this dumb lot? Have they nothing to say? Can't speak our language, Father. They're English. Oh, are they? Don't speak it but understand, I bet. As soon as we're rid of the French, you'd better get off home as well. Or I'll get rid of you myself. They're here to help, Father. They came to help us. They came. They helped. But if the French are here, it's because of them. It's this blasted continental blockade. It is, isn't it? - Well... - Of course it is. Very well. They came. They've helped. Agreed. Sometimes they help a bit too much. Ask Brites how much they helped. Just two?! We only saw three, Father. And we couldn't get the third. It kicked Vintm here in the back, and tried to take a bite out of me. I nearly lost my arm. It shot off into the trees. There's no sign of the others. Well go on then, get things ready. Let's give thanks to the Virgin for the French she put in our grasp, and the supper we'll put in our paunch, in Her infinite mercy. Come on, let's go! You bunch of sinners. You lot too. What're they doing there? The Abbot sent them to cut the heads off the French... Why? To put along the road to Lisbon. So the others know what to expect. - You didn't pray. - What? This afternoon. You didn't pray. - Why do you say that? - You didn't move your lips. - I was praying in my head. - No, you weren't. You're like me. You don't pray. You don't pray? I can't any more. I dreamt about you. When? You don't know me. I dreamt about you three nights running. About me, how? Bathed in tears. Why?! For me. Only fools think wars aren't meant for women. They kill as well as men do, and die the same death. That one... She's sent more Jacobins to the kingdom of heaven than you and me together. To heaven? Or hell? What hell? Hell doesn't exist. This is hell. Hell is down here. Hell is us. Now up there, there's no war. Up there, even heretics sit at the Lord's table in peace. Merciful warrior not staining God's name with the blood you spill. God has nothing to do with this. God is peace. You can't sleep? If I sleep, I dream. About me? About the war. Blood. Dead people. The Abbot said the English had helped you. They did. Come on, quick! Hey, lads. Come. Come and see! No! No! Don't move! See your child? Let us do it. Why do you resist? The English! I wanted to die. But I didn't. I watched with foreboding as the Abbot's motley army tried to find cover in that desolate place, they seemed to be headed straight for the depths of hell. I secretly said a prayer for him. No matter what, as I had said to Bordalo, he was Portuguese and a man of God... I almost felt bad about letting Bordalo lie to him about the Poles and himself. I have no idea why, but though we come from different worlds and have such different views, Bordalo reminded me of the older brother I'd never had. Do you need help? I have help enough. If you want to sell that pot, I'll buy it. It'll lighten the beast's load. I'm not selling nothing. Nor buying! He's ill. The English girl's right. You really should... What with? We have no guns. Here's the Tagus. Here's the sea. Here's Lisbon... This here is Torres Vedras. This is the first line of Torres. The vital one. There's not even the eye of a needle for the French to get through. What if they do? They won't. They can't get through. But if they do, there are still two lines before Lisbon. I'm not sure where. I haven't seen them... The last is somewhere around Sintra, I think. Here. But they won't get through! Only by crossing the Tagus. And that's impossible. It's as wide as a sea! And the sea... ...belongs to the English. They can't get through! Attention! Down there! The French! How many? Who knows? More than these sons of bitches. They look more dead than alive. They're heading for Lisbon. They won't set foot there. Where are they taking us? What do you want to do? We'll get lost in this shit hole without them. Don't you think we're already lost, idiot? Shit, what the hell is this? - What carnage! - Too right! It was the bastard French! They can't be far away. What a beautiful whore! Lovely girl... You! What are you doing!? Stop that! Stop it now! Now! Monsieur Lvque, we have to go. All right. Gather my things. By afternoon that day we could finally see the first fortification. Later, we were to see others, bigger and better equipped. But that one was ours; t was there we waited, feet firmly planted, for the French. The English had recruited everyone from round about to help fortify the lines. All had left their homes, smallholdings and families to labour there in the sun, rain and wind, whatever God sent. None complained. Ti Miguel! - That's my godfather, isn't it? - It is. He's still alive. No! No, thank you. I'm going to buy some apples. Five apples, please. Thank you. Maria de Jesus! Vicente! Maria de Jesus... Praise God! I looked for you everywhere. I was so afraid! I thought you'd... ...that something awful had happened. Maria de Jesus! My dove! I was so afraid you were dead. I am dead to you, Vicente. Let me go. It's better you don't ask why. Believe me. Let me go, Vicente. Pretend I'm dead. Forget me. No! What are you saying? You can't... It's not possible! Please, my angel! For the love of God! I've missed you so much, my love. - Our house still stands. - Let me go, leave me! - Vicente! Let me go! - She said let her go! Do you hear? Leave him alone. Don't hurt him. Don't, Alberto. In this world War is a butcher shop And peace, a brothel For one such as I This world has no place Signed: Bordalo, poet. Good luck, Lieutenant. Goodbye. Godfather! Father! It's my godfather. You made it, then? Just about. Had a close shave, in Buaco. Sit down. Sup with us. Afonso caught a rabbit this morning. He caught me more like. I was spinning in the wind and he ran right into my hands. A slice of bacon. Some olives. You needn't have. And down below? Not a stone left standing. I even burnt the vines. And the medlar. It was older than me. Cattle are all gone, too. It's the same all over. From Coimbra on down, it's a desert. The land will take time to heal. "You do not know that there formerly dwelt in your land" "the fairest and noblest race of men which ever lived," "and that you and your whole city" "are descended from a small seed or remnant of them which survived." "And this was unknown to you, because, for many generations," "the survivors of that destruction died..." "...leaving no written word." It's the third redoubt we've built, Afonso and I. We've been at it for over a year. But I miss the land. To see a cabbage grow... the smell of the cattle. What about you? Would you rather do this, or till the land? I want to be like you. - What? A soldier? - Not as long as I draw breath. I've paid my dues. Miguel, do you know that bearded chap? He's new. Don't know his name. He's not from these parts. I feel I've seen him before, don't know where. It's time to get going. Are you going back when this is all over? If I'm still alive. Aren't you? I don't think I could bear to see the well. Good night. What well, Father? Ours. The one Rosa leapt into it with her son to escape the French. Let's get some sleep. It's late. Sergeant? A semaphore message from Socorro. It seems the French won't be long in coming. Less than a day's march. They'll be here tomorrow morning. You're a crook, Penabranca. I won't haggle... But I tell you to your face, you're a thief. The lad's burning up. There's plague about. You should get him to Misericrdia Hospital. I'm not his father. I feel sorry for you. A man all alone... It's true, really. I don't think it's fair. It's your wife, Christ, or isn't she? What right do I have to have her? None, whatsoever! Listen... Listen. Let's settle in good terms, alright? Like gentleman. You can have her for 20 cruzados. I know I should return her for free. But I've spent some money, you understand. She eats, she drinks... That's expensive as hell nowadays! We are at war, or did you forget that? Come on! Ten cruzados and that's it! - Alberto! - Maria de Jesus! Don't touch me! Don't you dare touch me, Vicente! You should be ashamed... a man in his state. Come, my love, lean on me. Get out of my sight, Vicente! Go away, you coward! Leave us alone! Five cruzados. Six. It's not worth more. Good morning, Francisco. Good afternoon. First word of the day... Second word of the day... Marry me, Maureen. Marry me. I cannot. But why? So what? We get married! Then your child is my child. No, Francisco! Percy is dead. He died. - The dead don't have children. - Percy's not dead! Percy... here. Percy... here. Here. The French will be here tomorrow... The French. Tomorrow. If you really want to leave, you'd better waste no time... A keepsake? Goodbye. What place is this, aunt Flora? It looks like a staging post! What are all these girls doing here? We should go back home. I'm terribly tired... Mother will be getting worried. No, no, I've let her know, don't worry. Why are you being so formal? Are you cross with me, aunty? No, I'm not cross. Wait for me here. I need to have a few words with my friend over there. - I'd rather go with you. - No. Do as I say. Wait for me here. Don't be wilful. I'll be back. Good morning, Dona Filipa. Miss. Miss? Yes. Miss Filipa. Is this truly the new school, sister? I thought so. It is! I recognized two or three of the girls... They were at the Sisters of Mercy last year. I realised later on. Mother had said... ...I could stay at home this year. Tell her I'm not cross with her, aunt Flora. Is this my bed? Well... I'll be going now... I have things to do. I'll leave you here with sister... I'll be off. Won't you give me a kiss, aunt Flora? A kiss. Of course I will! I was just about to. I'm so afraid I won't see her again. Me? No. Filipa. The other one. Nonsense... Don't say that, you'll make me cry too. We'll pray for his soul, my son. I'm not your son. Platoon! Shoulder... Arms! Platoon! Prepare to salute the flag. Present... Arms! D. Pedro! Lieutenant, sir! - I thought you were dead and buried! - Buried is an exaggeration! But dead... yes, almost. How did you get here? How did you cross the country with Jacobins all over the place? Alone? It's a long story, Sergeant. But finish the manoeuvre or they'll turn to pillars of salt. Platoon! Shoulder... Arms! Platoon! Stand at ease. I don't know how you got here, but you came in time. The French aren't far off. You've arrived just in time for the dance. The outskirts of Lisbon were covered in fortifications the English had secretly been building for a year and a half. Marechal Massena, who for 6 months had been preparing to invade Portugal, knew nothing of these huge constructions. Baron de Marbot! Wellington? Wellington. We soon discovered that the English entrenchment formed a huge arc around Lisbon, extending 15 Portuguese leagues, equivalent, more or less, to 15 leagues in France. Excuse me, sir... Wasn't that Miss Warren? Do you know her? We shared a room. In hospital, that is. I mean, her father and I... You don't say. It's a small world... She came to bid farewell. She's returning to England. Oh, returning? - Did she ask after me? - No. Of course not. - She probably doesn't remember I exist. - Quite. "Ah, think, my Lord, that any other tye" "would shame the Caesars, authors of my birth?" "No, Madam, he to whom I mean to give ye" "may without shame unite your race with his." "You need not blush when you accept his flame." "- Whom does my Lord intend? - Madam, my self." "Your self!" "I would have nam'd another, Junia, had there been any other above Nero." "My eyes, to find a choice you might subscribe to," "have travell'd o'er the Court, Rome, and the Empire..." Sergeant? Are you there, Sergeant? The man with the beard! Zanaga! The nurse! Eusbio! I knew I'd seen him before. Do you know him? He carried you off the battlefield at Buaco. Zanaga!? It seems we both knew him before. But not in the same guise... Franois-Marie Vilarreal. Sergeant of the Imperial Guard. On a mission behind the enemy lines. Behind the lines and not in uniform, you know what to expect... I did my duty. You do yours. May I, Major sir? Go ahead, Lieutenant. The Abbot and the others? They fell in the field with honour. They battled bravely to the last. I did what I had to. You did what you had to? - You betrayed them! - No, Lieutenant. My father was Portuguese. My mother, French. In all conscience I served both nations serving the Emperor. I betrayed no one. Platoon! - Halt! - Volunteer for the squad, sir. - May I ask why? - The landslide yesterday. My godson didn't make it. I don't object, but nor do I approve. Personal revenge, Sergeant, is not seemly in a soldier. I'm a soldier by chance, Lieutenant. I was born a farmer. Advance... Riflemen! Advance... Prisoner! Arms... Make ready! Aim... - Long live the Emperor! - Fire! "When the father creator" "saw the creature which he had made moving and living," "the created image of the eternal gods," "he rejoiced," "and in his joy," "determined to make the copy still more like the original;" "and as this was eternal," "he sought to make the universe eternal," "so far as might be." "Now the nature of the ideal being was everlasting," "but to bestow this attribute in its fulness upon a creature was impossible." "Wherefore he resolved to have..." "...a moving image of eternity." It's over! Good morning, Ti Miguel. What have you got for us there? A Christian, in need of burial. Burial, here? I don't know if that's allowed... It was here he died. What's the matter, private? What does he want? What's this body doing here? One of the workmen, sir... wants to bury this deceased. Here?! This isn't a cemetery, uncle. No one gets buried here. Know you, sir, that I raised four sons. The oldest was killed by the French two years ago in Vimeiro. The two youngest, taken by the plague a short time ago. One remained. He fell beneath those boulders, yesterday. He was not yet eighteen. A year and a half he worked at my side, sun up to sundown, every day God sent, on these works you had us build. This is where he worked. This is where he died. And it's here, as I see it, with your permission... ...it's fair he be laid to rest. Let him. Detachment... Shoulder... Arms! Present... Arms! Slope... Arms! The French army crossed the border in April 1811, quitting Portuguese territory for good. They left behind a devastated, exhausted and radically transformed country.
