And he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in." That's ridiculous. No animal could huff and puff that hard. SNOOPY: Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! That dog is gonna drive us crazy. [SNOOPY WHISTLING] Ooh. Ooh, that dog. [PLANE ENGINE STARTING] [PLANE ENGINE RUMBLING] [EXPLOSIONS] [MACHINE-GUN FIRE] [LAUGHING] [MACHINE-GUN FIRE] [MACHINE-GUN FIRE] [GUNSHOTS] [MACHINE-GUN FIRE] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [ENGINE BACKFIRES] [ENGINE SPUTTERS] [ENGINE BACKFIRES] After the show, we'll stop and get a hot-fudge sundae, okay? - Okay, fine. - Bang! Bang! Boy, Charlie Brown, it was a great show. Free candy, 10 cartoons and three monster pictures. ALL: Well, Charlie Brown? - Well, what? That dog is impossible. Charlie Brown, you've got to do something about that dog. - It's up to you, Charlie Brown. - Why me? ALL: Because he's your dog, Charlie Brown! CHARLIE [IN VOICEOVER]: Dear Daisy Hill Puppy Farm... ...I am writing in regard to one of your less distinguished alumni. Perhaps a refresher course in obedience and the social graces... ...would be appropriate. Therefore, I am going to send him back... ...and have you teach him a little discipline. I'm sorry, Snoopy, but it's for your own good. The kids just can't stand your undisciplined behavior. [RINGING] Hello? Oh, hi, Chuck. I'm calling to ask a favor. Remember Snoopy, my shortstop? Sure, Chuck. You mean that funny-looking kid with the big nose? Yeah, I guess he does have kind of a big nose. Well, anyway, he's going on a little trip across town, see. He's going back to school for a little refresher course. Back to school? Poor kid. Oh, it's nothing serious. He'll see his family and have a good time. That's great. He deserves it. You know, he's the only one on your team who really knows what's going on. So, what's the favor you wanted? I wonder if he could stop at your house and spend the night. See, he's going to walk, and he'll only get about as far as your house the first evening. Sure, Chuck old boy. Happy to be of service. Tell your friend Peppermint Patty will see he's comfortable. So long, Chuck. That shortstop was the funniest-looking kid I ever saw. Now, don't forget, Snoopy, stop over at Peppermint Patty's. She's expecting you. Oh, don't forget your dish. You're supposed to bring your own dish. So long, old pal. [CAN CLATTERING] Hey, it's the shortstop. Hi, pal. Glad you could make it. Going back to school, eh? Chuck says you'll have lots of fun. Must be a drag, though, having to go back to school. Here's your room, Snoop. Put your stuff down here, then we'll take you for a little chow. You must be hungry after your long trip. Hi, Roy. We're gonna get us a bite to eat. Remember Snoopy? He's that strange kid I told you about. He never says a word but he's a good shortstop. Here you are, pal. This will take the chinks out of the old tummy. [EATS NOISILY] Boy, that's the strangest kid I've ever seen. It sure has been quiet around here without old Snoopy. I hope he's having a good time. I hope they haven't been too tough on him. Hi, Charlie Brown. Any news from Snoopy? You know, Snoopy drives me crazy, but it sure has been quiet since he left. I hope they don't mistreat him. [SNAPS] Roy, there's something about that kid out there. You almost get the idea that he thinks he's a soldier on leave in Paris. Heh-heh-heh. Ha-ha-ha. [SNAPS] Here you are, Snoopy. Glad you could stay an extra day. Hope they don't miss you at school. Hmm. [SNAPS] What is it with this kid? I wonder how long he's gonna stay. [WATER SPLASHING] [SNAPS] Boy, this kid is something else. I wonder if anybody misses him. He's been here a week... ...and I suddenly realize why nobody misses him. [RINGS] Hello? Snoopy? No, he isn't here. He's at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. This is the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm? He didn't show up? But he left a week ago. I don't understand. He left, and was supposed to stop at Peppermint Patty's, then-- Hello, Peppermint Patty? This is Chuck. Chuck Brown. Hi, Chuck. Boy, am I glad you called. Remember that shortstop of yours called Snoopy? He's still here, and he's eating us out of house and home. He seems to think he's at a resort. That kid is a strange one. He never says a word, just signals for service. [SNAPS] This is terrible. He was supposed to have gone to get some training. I'd better go over and pick him up. I hate to take this leash. But if he's going to act this way, it's his own fault. [RINGS DOORBELL] Hi, Chuck. Boy, am I glad to see you. That Snoopy friend of yours is something. Wait till you see him. He's wearing the strangest outfit. [SNAPS] Do you think you have to do it this way? I'm afraid I have to. Thanks for all you did for Snoopy. I know he appreciates it even if he doesn't say so. I wish you wouldn't do that. It's very embarrassing. Now look, Snoopy. If you'd done what you were supposed to, you wouldn't be treated like this. Now on, you're gonna have to be on a leash anytime you leave the yard. [CHOKING] Aah! What happened? I think I was attacked by an escaping-- An escaping prisoner. [PIANO PLAYING] [SNAPPING] [RINGS DOORBELL] You again? Well, if you're looking for a place to stay, let's get one thing straight right now. We have a rule in our family, that everyone pulls his own weight. If you're going to stay here, you're going to have to work. And it's gotta be done right. [VACUUM CLEANER WHIRRING] When you finish the hallway, start on the living room. [VACUUM CLEANER WHIRRING] PATTY: Mom says we can't eat till you finish the yard work. It sure is quiet around here. Yeah. As much as I hate baseball, I miss not playing or doing something. Since we lost our shortstop, you-know-who... ...our team doesn't seem to have the same old zip. Let's face it. It's not the same around here without Snoopy. Maybe I should try to get him back. Maybe you should try to get him back, Charlie Brown. That's it, Charlie Brown. Tell him we are willing to accept him back. [RINGS DOORBELL] Hi, Chuck. What are you doing way out here? Well, it's about Snoopy. I wonder if I could talk to him. I'll see if he can come, Chuck. He's sort of busy right now. [IN UNISON] Hey. I came to get you, Snoopy. I'm glad to see you are willing to let bygones be bygones. I'll put this on. Argh! Gee, Chuck. What's with the rope? Snoopy seems to hate this game you wanna play. Maybe you better get lost. It's sure great having Snoopy here. Boy, he's not only a good shortstop. He can sure help around the house. So long, Chuck. Okay, Snoop, back to work. You gotta pull your own weight if you're gonna live here. [VACUUM CLEANER WHIRRING] Snoopy refuses to come home. As soon as he saw the leash, he flipped. You blockhead. You shouldn't have showed him the leash. You should have decoyed him with a bone, and then jumped him and hog-tied him. Than dragged the ingrate home to those who appreciate him. If that stupid dog doesn't come home pretty soon... ...I'm gonna start missing him. ALL: Snoopy, come home! [GRUMBLING] [DISHES SHATTERING] Here, here, what's all this ruckus? You'd better ease up on that noise or out you go. You'd better clean up this mess. As a disciplinary measure, you'll sleep in the garage tonight. [SIGHS] [SOBBING] [SNOOPY HOWLING] [BARKING] [CAN CLATTERING] [SNOOPY KICKING DOOR] Yes, sir? What can I do for you? - Hey. - Hey. Boy, it's great to have you back, Snoopy. I don't mind telling you I've really missed you. Tomorrow we'll see the kids. They'll be glad to see you too. [SIGHS] - Hey, Linus. Guess who's back. - Aah! - He's back. - Who's back? [SNOOPY CLEARS THROAT] He's back. Ugh. Dog germs. ALL: Fight. Fight. Lucy and Snoopy are having a fight. Lucy and Snoopy are having a fight. Good grief. Already? Stand up and fight like a man. Here now, you two. Stop that fighting. Stop it, I say. Who's fighting? I surrender. I said, I surrender. I surrender. I said, I surrender! [THUD] He's back. Mmm.
