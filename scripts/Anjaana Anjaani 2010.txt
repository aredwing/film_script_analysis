Akash. There was a call from the bank. Our loan has been sanctioned. Yes, we're buying Ellen Steel company. - What? Why? lt's a small loan, for around 1-1 .5 million dollars. Ellen Steel is a dead company. We'll make our clients invest their money in it. Which will increase its stock value? And if the stock value increases.. ..so will the profit. - No, no, that's not ourjob. Taking loans is not what we do.. Akash? Chill Dude Sir, can you spare me some change. ''ls the season to be jolly..'' 'l am not responsible for this crash Mr. Lee' 'Sir, please don't raise your voice on me.' 'What happened when you made 150% profit last year? ' 'Fine, l don't need you to do business.' 'l will survive this.' 'Akash.' 'The market has crashed.' 'lts over man. it just moved too fast.' 'There was a call from the bank.' 'Yeah, we'll payback their loan.' 'They aren't going to lose their money.' 'Why did you do this? ' 'Listen, all of you knew that l was taking a loan.' 'That's a Lie.' 'You took our signatures for the loan.. ..telling us that it was for 1 million dollars.' 'And went ahead and took a loan of 12 million.' 'What, 12 million? ' 'Yes.. if that company had done well 'l wasn't going to be the only one to profit from it' 'We're all equal partners.' 'Would you guys have agreed.. ..if l had said it was a loan of 12 million? ' 'All of you.. ' 'All of you think small.' You think, it was easy to make this big office? 'l didn't know the market would crash.' So, you cheated us. 'You were in a hurry to make it big, isn't it? ' 'You wanted to win every race.' We don't want to come first. Our dreams aren't as big as yours 'What do you'll want to do? ' 'Shut down the company.' 'Sell the office! - Akash, please.' 'Try to understand. - not there' 'All of you were losers.' 'All of you were losers! - Akash, please' 'Go on.. let me see what you'll are capable of without me.' 'Where will we go? ' 'How will we repay the loan? ' Tell me how will we pay it back? - Gaurav. Where will we go and how will we repay it? - Gaurav, please. How will we repay the loan now, tell me How? What will we do without you? Your mom and dad live without you as well. You could neither be a good son, nor a good friend. What did you earn? Money. Now you don't even have that. Forget it. Forget it. We're losers. Yes. But today.. you're the loser. And the suicide rate has risen to 27.. A 48year old man committed suicide today.. ..by jumping off his office building. lt seems he was everything. l am not responsible for this crash. Market, there's crash. How did l know that the market would crash? Die. Should l push you? What else? You've been standing there for so long. Actually no. Because that will amount to murder. No, no, l don't think so. Please continue, jump jump You know.. when you want to do something like this.. ..you shouldn't think. Just do it. Are you a suicide consultant? lts common sense, man. When l am slightly drunk.. l talk a lot. Jabberjabberjabberjabber Actually, in real life l am very quiet. Like really quiet. But wait.. this is real life. Sorry. l am sorry. Concentrate. Quiet. Continue, jump jump You know.. when l was really young. Really young. l never liked drinking medicine. My mother would say to me ''Close your eyes..'' ''..count to three and drink it''. Just.. So try that. Okay, so l am also done. Boy. One. Two. Three. Get off the bridge now! Oh no! Coast guard. Oh no. God! Alright, break it up you two, get off the bridge, the party is over. Get off the bridge now. Come on. 'l'll elope with you on this.' 'l am at the Hilton and the room number.. ' 'Last night l did the same thing..' l found out about your accident. l've come alone No one else was ready to see you. Then why are you here? The loan you.. The loan we took, has been sorted out with the bank We are dissolving the company's assets. We've also found a buyer for the office. And we'll repay the rest by selling our personal belongings. The bank has summoned us on the 30th. Everyone. Since you are the guarantor.. ..it is important for you to be there, Akash. Akash, l know that the bank has seized your house. But even after what has happened.. ..you can still live with us. For as long as you want. Really. Please. Be there on the 30th. For once, Do something for others. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? Oh God. Why are you following me? l can't help it, you're so attractive you know What happened to you? l tried to jump from the bridge after you and the police left.. ..and fell down. And that's all that happened to you? l fell on the bridge not from the bridge. l was so drunk. Did you really want to die? - No, l was sightseeing. What happened to you? l tried again as well. Jumped in front of a car. And you failed as well. So.. are you going to try again? Hmm.. You too? What are you doing? Just.. They'll think that we're escaping.. ..from the mental asylum in these clothes. One more thing. l've no interest in you. Zilch. Get that straight. l don't know if l should be relieved.. ..or then begin to wonder why you aren't interested in me? Not that l want you to be interested in me. lf you know what l mean? What am l doing with you? Hey. These scrubs look so funny from the back, isn't it? Whatever. l am Kiara. - Akash. So.. what is your plan? - Listen, please leave me alone. You know, you are very rude But, l am still asking you. Can we do this together? This isn't a game of double tennis that we can do together l'm just saying that because.. ..l want to make sure it happens. l've been very dependant in life. l've always needed.. a push. So please. Well.. it's strange, but.. fine. How do you want to do it? We can go to my house. - What? l am not inviting you for coffee. Whatever. We can go to your house as well. l don't have a house. Stop. Stop. Stop. Here. Come on. - This way? l never have my house keys. After you. - Oh no. You're very smart. l know why you want to climb up after me. Come on, l am cold. - Oh please. Okay. Can you push me a little bit? - With pleasure. Lights on. Music on. What the hell. l hate this song. Excuse me. What are you doing? Making place to sit. No need to get.. too comfortable. You're not here to stay. Let's do what we have to. - What? l know, l know. We've ropes. We can hang ourselves. These sprinklers won't be able to take your weight. You know you're.. - Do you have plastic wrap? What will we do with plastic wrap? - Do you have it? Okay. Here. Asphyxiation. - As.. What? Suffocation. lt's very effective. You, first take this and wrap it tightly around my face. Then l'll wrap it around your's. Then, when the oxygen stops reaching our brains, in a few minutes.. ..it will stop working. Let's start. - Ya. Okay. Your face is too long. Can you breathe? No? Okay. Alright. Now my turn. Come on. Alright. Start already! Oh my, God. You cheat. You knew it.. you knew that you wouldn't be able to help me. l won't let you die. You will die and l will be the murderer. ls it my fault? You blindfolded my eyes, how could l see? Couldn't you tell me before? lf you had died, l would've been jailed. This is so not going to work. Oh my, God. l have an idea. There are just three left. Okay. May l? - Okay. Paper. - Paper. Paper. - Paper, quickly. Paper. Paper. Paper. - Quickly Kiara. More paper? l'll get it. More paper. More paper. More paper. More paper. - More paper. ls the gas on? ls the gas on? The gas is on. Kiara. - Yes. When did you last pay your bill? - Which bill? Your gas bill. Your gas connection has been cut off for the past 2 months l have never cooked. How was l supposed to know? Look, l don't know if you think this is a joke.. But for me, it isn't lf you got hold of me ..just to get rid of your loneliness, then go pick someone else up. Go to any bar, l'm sure you'll find someone there. Butjust leave me alone. Look, l am.. l am sorry. l think l know why this is happening. Last night we met on the bridge. Both of us. But the coast guard arrived. We then tried separately, but failed. Then we met in the hospital. Strangely again.. we decided to commit suicide together. We came home. Tried twice. But failed again. So many attempts in one day, but all failed. Why? Do you believe in signs? What rubbish is this? lt's just that you don't want to die. l have tried just as hard as you have, Akash. Maybe you or me have something left to do in life? 'The bank has called us on the 30th.' 'For the first time.. do something for others.' Okay fine. Then explain to me why we are still alive. 'Since you are the guarantor.. ' '.. it is very important for you to be there, Akash.' lts rubbish. lts nonsense, l don't believe in all this. Maybe.. maybe you're right. Let's try again. Let's try your idea. And this time we'll be careful. l am telling you, Akash. So many signs. There has to be a reason.. something.. that is stopping us. Should we take some time? Two days? Four days? What's the date today? Seventh.. eighth November.. - 1 1th December. Yes, right. Then 31st December. Means.. 1 1 , 12, 13, 14.. - 20days. - lts 20days. Right. So 31st December. New Year's night. New Year's night. At 12o'clock. We'll jump from that bridge. lts a pact. But what will we do in these 20days? Things to do before you die. Everyone boasts of things that they wish to do before they die.. But never end up doing them. Anything. Fun, spontaneous, adventurous. Everyone does it to enjoy their life. We'll do it to die! No, its all nonsense. l can't do this. You could neither be a good son, nor a good friend. 'Akash its over man, itjust moved too fast.' 'You were always in a hurry to make it big, weren't you? ' 'You wanted to win every race.' 'Shut down the company.' 'Sell the office! ' 'All of you were losers.' 'All of you were losers! ' 'Where will we go? How will we repay the loan? ' Tell me, how will we pay it back? ' EROS So l guess, new year's night l guess. ''Close your eyes when you don't see your destination.'' ''When you close your eyes and seek you find the path to God.'' ''Change your own fate.'' ''Have courage and move ahead.'' ''My footprints will show you the way.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' You can't report four hours late for work. This is completely ridiculous. You can'tjust walk-in whenever you feel like. You know what, you are fired. ''Take a look at yourself.'' ''Why did you give-in to the situation and give up.'' l was going to quit anyway. ''Your courage can change your destiny.'' ''Fill your world with the colour of your dreams.'' ''l am always with you.'' ''So what if the sun's setting.'' ''You'll find my threshold when the darkness sets in.'' ''And that is where you'll find new hope once again.' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' ''You're unaware that God's all around you.'' But why me first? Because knowing you.. ..you must have a strange, complicated wish. Or you might not have a wish at all No, no, of course l do. Really? Then tell me. Take your time. There's no hurry. Come on. Have you done everything? lsn't there anything that you wanted to do.. ..but didn't get the chance to.. ..or left it for later l mean.. there's got to be something. There's one thing actually. - Finally? Tell me. Can l.. get a beer? And that's your wish? l need the beer so that.. l can tell you what my wish is? That's nice. This seems like it's going to be a really good wish. Here. So.. l thought l'll wait. You know for.. for the right girl. Kiara! What? - You were sleeping. No. No, l wasn't sleeping at all. How could l sleep.. When l was listening very carefully.. To everything that you didn't say. Seriously. l am a virgin. Move. What did you say? - l have never.. You know.. l have never done it l never got the time. First l focused on studies and then my job. And it wasn't like l didn't have my opportunities.. lts just that l was waiting for the right girl. What? What is so funny? You're talking like a 15year old girl. ln fact.. even 15year old girls don't talk like that here.. lf l had a 15year old daughter and she didn't talk like this.. ..l'd break her legs l am sure. But to have a 15year old daughter, you have to first be a father. And to be a father.. you have to.. - Yes, l know. Okay. But you're a lucky guy. Because tomorrow's the night. Where, ladies and gentlemen.. ..a wish, a dream will be fulfilled. A wish will come true. Akash. Blush. Blush. Akash. Are you serious? Yeah.. lsn't she gorgeous? - Gorgeous? She'll feel bad. She's very sensitive. She'll feel bad? - Yes. Hi, baby, did you miss me because l missed you too. You missed me my blushy-wushy googly-poogly. Yeah. Does she work? or are we just here to pay her a visit? l know, l know. He can be a pain but try to manage tonight. The party starts now, baby. What are we doing here, Kiara? We've got to fulfil your last wish, remember? Peshto. How are you? - Oh my, God. How have you been? When did you arrive? You didn't even call. l know, l was slightly busy. Why do girls always meet each other.. ..like they've been just been let out of the mental asylum. who is he? That.. - Hi, Akash. Akash. Oh, the virgin. lsn't it cute, Sam? Does everyone in this club know this? - Peshto. Not really.. - Kiara. Sam. - Sam, Kiara. - Hi. Hi. - Really nice to meet you. Hi. - Pleasure to meet you. Darling, l got to take this. - Okay.

He's talking to his wife right now l can lip-read. You'll learn to too, if you work in the stock market long enough. He's telling her that he is out entertaining some Chinese clients But he was going to have dinner with me at Lobo tonight. There ain't no Lobo tonight, my darling. He's going back home. Darling, l got to go. Some problem with the shipment, alright. Bye. Take care. - Bye. Bye, guys. - Bye. Pleasure meeting you. C'mon Stay back. - l've to go. No, stay back. - l've to go. What about the party? - Work. - You.. Work! Bye. Screw it. Anyway, he was quite boring. And there are so many hot guys in here. l'll see you guys later. But listen.. - You guys have fun. And you.. you're not too bad. Bye. - Bye. Come on.. Let's hit the bar. Excuse me. Sorry. Can l have two large jacks, please? Nice So this, my friend, is your playground..

Firstly, l try to help you, and then.. lt's just that l couldn't do it. You should've told me earlier. We could've seen a doctor. Listen, it's a very common problem Listen, when l say l can't do it.. ..l mean with a stranger, having paid her money ls it so difficult to understand? Look at me You think l didn't have any girlfriends.. or that l didn't get opportunities. lt's just that.. l never felt it was right. l wanted to wait.. to fall in love. l know it's stupid. But that's just the way it is Oh so basically you've never been in love. So that's your wish. Oh, dude. That's a very difficult wish to fulfil. But.. Love isn't easy.. Oh no, just a minute. l've got an original one. What wish is one that can be easily obtained. What wish is one that can be easily obtained. Where there is no struggle in fulfilling it. Which once attained, should feel like an achievement Or else, life just goes by. Thank you. Thank you. That was very bad. Oh, God. Come on. You've got only 19 days.. to fall in love. Hey, the car is this way. Are you kidding me? l don't drink and drive. Okay, l'll drive. - Blush! No way. Only l drive her. Come on, we're walking. So the other day.. - Sorry. Go ahead. - No, you were saying something. Just that.. we've decided to live together for 20days. And we don't even know.. ..why we met on the bridge that night. Go on. Stock market crash. So you lost everything? And your family? My parents got divorced when l was eight years old. They kept fighting even after the divorce. My grandfather rescued me, and brought me here He educated me, sent me here. He passed away in 2001 . And since then l am alone. Where are your parents now? - l.. don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? You don't even talk to them? Well, neither do they. So what, Akash? Did you even try? Oh my, God. Say it, i don't care, l didn't have time, blah, blah, blah. l don't understand today's generation.. And you took your parent's permission.. ..before committing suicide, isn't it? You care a lot for them, don't you? So.. - What? Your turn. - Oh look, we're home. Kiara, where are you going? Come on. l lived in San Francisco with my family Kunal and my family had known each other for a really long time. Especially since we had migrated from lndia together And that day, as usual Kunal forgot my birthday. l had gotten used to it. But still used to get angry on him. He was used to this anger. Yeah, dad? Oh, Kunal hasn't called yet. - Goodnight, dad. Goodnight, baby. l've been trying to call you all day.. lt either gets directed to voicemail or you just don't answer it. Okay, fine. l thought of calling you And it's you that always says ''lt's the thought that counts''. l really thought of calling you. Kiara, it's your birthday. Be nice to people. Smile. lt's my birthday, and l should be nice to other people? Yes, let's go now. Come on, come on that's enough now. l've got something to show you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Look at her, isn't she gorgeous? - You like her? Of course, Kunal. - lsn't it? You're buying a gift for yourself on my birthday. l mean how sweet is that. But, you do this every year. Camera. Electric guitar. Home theatre system. - Enough. PS3. And now this bike, Which is for me. All your gifts are for me. Thanks so much Kunal, l am so touched. l bought the camera to click your photographs.. And the home theatre, was for us to watch movies together And the guitar? That was to compose songs for you And the PS3? - PS3? OK fine, that's one thing, that l bought for myself. But this.. is for you to sit on. And you know what.. we will run away on this Come on. Hey. Hey, hi babe. - Hi. So this is it. Fourteen days until the wedding.. ..and l see what the problem is. Your living room is your bedroom. And the bedroom? - ls more like a storeroom. Hey, babe, just pass me a beer. - Yes. l'll be right back. Hey, would you like a beer? - No, thank you Maybe a glass of wine? Or.. a cosmo? l don't drink at work. But here's my card. Give me a call at night. l'll drink anything. Okay, okay, break it up you two. Emanuel is a dream worker, aren't you? Honey, l am your fairy Godmother. We're going to transform this place. - Perfect. He really is a fairy Cheers. Be nice. - Bye, Emanuel. Okay, - The DVD collection. We'll talk later. And anyway, l am feeling sleepy. What are you doing? - lts called cleaning. You know, cleaning. - No, l don't know. And l don't want to know. You know, for the first time.. ..l don't have anything to do after 9 o'clock. So l thought l'd do this. Where did this sofa come from? - This one? Yes. - lt's your sofa. No. - Yes. lt was hidden behind your pile of clothes. And yes.. l found your house key. Or should l say.. keys. Coffee. Low fat. What. l like full fat. - You're most welcome. Day 3, your turn to make a wish Why am l.. so scared of your wish? Okay. Let's just forget about these wishes. lt's a bad idea anyway. - Why? Now that it's my turn, suddenly it's a bad idea? lt's not like my wish has been fulfilled either. l will get your wish fulfilled. lt will take time though.. And anyway we've got 19days. Yeah right. Tell me.. or l'll just die out of suspense. So my wish is that we'll swim.. ..in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, today. What? - Yes. That's dumb. lts minus two degrees and l don't indulge in such madness. Oh, so your wish is ''Beautiful, special, you won't understand''.. ..and my wish is dumb? Kiara, that is suicide. - Really? Fine. ls this why you've kept me alive? Bathing in the sea has made you even more salty Wouldn't it be so easy.. to forget everything and live each day happily.. To fulfil your every wish, like its your last day But life always interferes. Here. Write. - What? What you just said? Live each day like it's your last. Why? - Just write it. Leave. l wish that someone.. ..without a reason to live, finds this. l wish that there's no one like that. Okay, its bikini time. Akash, where is my bag with the swimsuit. lt must be there. - l don't really see it. l am sorry.. l forgot that bag on the jetty. What? - Yes. No, Akash. - l am so sorry. Come on, let's go back. Just a minute, we aren't going anywhere. How will we swim without our swim suits? Actually, l can. - How? Oh, come on. l have this. l am not going to take off my clothes. l am not shameless like you. l am shameless? - Of course. There's no one around here for atleast 10 kilometres, to see you. Look, l have no interest in seeing you undress Hey, watch it. - What else can l say? l am very interested in seeing you undress. But l control myself. Happy? That's why l think we should go back Don't put up a charade. Crazy woman. Wants to swim here in the cold. Akash.. My leg.. - Kiara! Akash. - Kiara! Kiara, catch! Catch! Oh God. Help! Help! l can't swim. Akash. l can't swim. The boat. The boat's drifting away, Akash. ls this why you forgot the bag? because you can't swim. lf you weren't acting that you're drowning.. ..we wouldn't be here and the boat wouldn't have drifted away So, now it's my fault? - Of course it's your fault. ls it my fault that you can't swim? l wonder which era you've landed here from. Now, l am stuck with you. l want to pee. - What? Here? Right now? - Yes. You.. you can't do it here. - What do you mean? How long can l control it? - l don't know. But doing it in the water, that's disgusting Akash. Why.. why don't you swim a little ahead? The waves will take it away A wave like that one. Akash, what's that? ls that a shark? No, no, that's not a shark. lt looks like a floating cloth. lt looks like someone's boxers. You pervert. And l was standing next to you all this while Disgusting. My boxers.

Did she have a fight with someone? Did she lose herjob or was she betrayed? lt must be some stupid reason like that, isn't it? Have some problem, so do you want to commit suicide?

Think about it Kiara We met on that bridge, our story began from there. But that doesn't mean it has to end there. We tried to die so many times. How many chances did we give death? Five. And life? How many times did we try to solve our problems? Sit down and face them? Not even once. And we say that life's not fair. ln these past few days l have learnt that.. ..no matter how many reasons you have to die.. ..you need just one to live. l found your reason, Kiara.

Go back to him. You know your happiness lies with him. Everything can be just as it was. Where you felt that you're the luckiest girl in the world. There's just a slight change.
