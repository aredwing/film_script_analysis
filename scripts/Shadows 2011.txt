No, Dad, I got it. Sweetheart, Grandpa is waiting for us. How about I let you take them all out when we get there, hmm? No, Dad, I can do it. I can. Let him do it. Okay. [Grunts] Watch out. It's heavy. Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. You know, before you know it, he won't need me anymore. It's okay, honey. I'll always need you. And not just to carry your luggage? Promise? Promise. Is there another way to go? Try turning right up here on Surawong. Say hi. - Hi. - Hi. How much longer to Grandpa's? At this rate, a million years. Did you really fly all the way over here the first time just to meet Mommy? Almost. Not quite. I first met your grandpa on business, and then I had to come out here on a trip, and I met your mother. And the rest is history. I was born! Where did we find this kid? He's all you, honey. Yeah, except looks. Thank God he has your looks. Group shot! [Chuckles] - Is this the turn right here? - Yeah. Come on, honey, you don't want to miss the light. [Groans] Oh, come on, you could have made it. Down, Kyle. We didn't fly halfway around the world to get a speeding ticket. [Loud crash] [Glass shattering] [Slow breathing] [Grunts] My God. - That's all right. - Rangsan. I've been praying for this, Jeff. Dr. Anand said we should never give up hope. How long? I had you moved here to my condo two weeks ago. You were in the hospital three weeks before that. Som... and Kyle? Jeff, I'm sorry. They did everything they could. We just... We lost them. [Somber music] Keep the drip at 100ccs. You can begin to taper off once he starts accepting fluids orally. Yes, of course. Other than that, he checks out great. Good. The shunt site's healing well. - All right. - It's quite remarkable. Now, it will take some time for him to stabilize. He could still have some bruising on the cerebellum. As you know, Rangsan, I'm always available for you. Thank you, Doctor. I've got Choi here full-time with Jeff. I have to leave town for a week. If you need to reach me, Choi has all my international numbers. Do you want to try some of this? No, no, no. No, it's all right. I'll give it to you. Who are you? Sorry. You're right. My name is Choi. Choi? Try a little ice. Hmm? There you go. Group shot! [Grunting] Jeff? Are you all right? Yes. Yes, I'm fine. No, I got it. I got it. [Grunting] [High-pitched tone] [Eerie moaning] Do you need some help? Tired? No. No. - You're okay, right? - Yes. - Okay, you sure? - Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Don't you ever have a day off? Not when I'm working. How about when you're not working? I live with my mother. But usually I'm not on a job this long. Huh? Usually my job only lasts a few weeks. I mainly do end-stage hospice care. Hospice. You mean people who are dying? Yes. That's a cheerful job. I guess I fooled you, didn't I? Yes, you fooled me. So it's a first for both of us. Let's see how you feel in the morning, and if you're sure you want to go, I'll take you to the temple. I'd like that. - Good night. - Good night. [High-pitched tone] [Screaming] [Indistinct voices] [Woman sobbing] [Electronic beeping] Are you all right? Somebody's hurt... a woman. Something's wrong. A woman? Mmhmm. Right next door. The hallway to the elevator is on the other side. Are you sure it's not from... I'm sure. It's just on the other side of that wall. Now... now, help me. Look, I'll go check. You stay here, okay? There wasn't anyone. What? I- I-I-I-I... I heard her. I heard... You had a long day today. It's a lot to take on so soon. Yes. Yes, you're probably right. The driver of the SUV died the next day. Watch your step. I'll give you a moment. Hey, Dad. Daddy. Help us. [Man speaking indistinctly over television] [Woman sobbing] [Woman sobbing] Are you all right? Help me, please. I can't breathe. You're doing great. Jeff? Hmm? I said you're doing great. With what? Your walking. [Coughing] Jeff, are you okay? You should have a break. Okay. All right? Thirsty? Let's see. Cha dum yen. - Would you like one? - Sure. Okay, I'll get it for you. Be right back. [Panting] [High-pitched tone] [Grunting] [Gasps] I want to go back to the apartment. Okay, all right. Calm down. What happened? I saw something. I don't know. It couldn't be. What did you see? A man, a body, falling. I don't understand. I want to go back now. All right. Take it easy. We're gonna call Dr. Anand and make an appointment, okay? Okay? Jeff? Now, just because all of our scans are clean doesn't mean that these episodes of disorientation are any less real to him. He's been through a lot. Now, I have a new prescription for him. It's an antidepressant. There's another here for Haldol. Try them out. See how it goes. You're gonna be just fine, Jeff. The scans look really good, completely clean. Nothing to worry about, really. Okay. [Screaming] [Echoing] Help us. [Retching] [Vomiting] What are you doing up? I came in to check on you. Jeff. Tell me what's happening. I'm not imagining what I've been seeing. Every time it happens, I get that dj vu feeling. It's like I'm seeing something that happened before. But all of this... There's got to be something more, isn't there? Does it have something to do with your family? Everything I'm supposed to feel for them... Isn't there. I mean, I think about them all the time. But I just... I don't feel anything. I can't cry. I'm not angry. There's nothing. We grow up here believing in things that can't be explained... Things that we can't see, we can't touch, but we know it's there. We know it's real. My cousin's aunt Mae Noi, she knows about these things. I think we should go and see her. What is it? Special tea. This will help you. Oh. [Coughing] It's very good. Please sit down. Choi told me what you have been seeing. You know, some people would consider it quite a gift. Not if they've been seeing what I've been seeing. The shadow world is a very disturbing place. Shadow world? [Speaking Thai] She says the shadow world is filled with unfortunate ones who died suddenly or died in a terrible way. Their souls are stuck, and they keep living their last moments over and over, like a bad dream. And that's what I've been seeing? [Speaking Thai] What? She says you can see them if you're looking at the place they died, at the time of the day they died, and, of course, only if the place is in the shadow. [Speaking Thai] Close your eyes, please. [Speaking Thai] Mae Noi said we can get more tea anytime we need it. We just have to call. Look, I appreciate your doing this, but I'm still not sure your aunt knows what's going on here. Well, no, I meant I'm sure she understood... Understood what? People don't just start seeing things like this out of the blue. It happens for a reason, and I really don't think I can be cured by your aunt's kind of medicine. But we have to do something. Look, I'm the one who's screwed here, remember? I can decide what I want to do. I know it's hard to see now, but with time, things change. Things can get better. You think I can just get back what I lost? No, of course not. But it doesn't mean you just give up. Look, just save it for your hospice patients, all right? I don't need it. Jeff, what are you doing? I just need to be alone right now. - I'll see you at home. - Jeff, no. [Indistinct whispering] [High-pitched tone] [Gunshot] [Screaming] [Speaking Thai] [High-pitched tone] Come on. Come on. Come on. [Woman sobbing] [Speaking Thai] Help me. Jeff, are you in here? Jeff? My God. What happened? [Speaking Thai] What is she saying? The shadow world should never be able to reach this side, not physically. And your connection, it's stronger than she thought. Your wound is serious. She can bring you strength. Turn off the light. You should let her try. Raise your hands up. Now close your eyes. [Whispering in Thai] [Sobbing] Help me, please. Mae Noi! What happened? It was the woman from the hall. We... we cannot do this alone. We need help. This is it? This is the place? You have got to be kidding me. It's been a long, long time. Yes, it has. There was no other... What you tried to do... It was foolish. [Speaking Thai] Outside. Who is this guy? I don't know. She'll be all right in a couple of hours. You can take her home. Excuse me, home? But I don't understand. Wait a minute. Look, Mr. Mills, you don't know me; I don't know you. But all of this, everything that happened to Choi's aunt, it all happened because of me. I know why you came. I don't think we can wait, so whatever you can do would be... Take your aunt and leave. [Knocking] How are you? Much better now. Tell Warren I need to speak to him about Jeff. - He must... - We tried. He said we should leave when you felt up to it. How can you do nothing when you know what is going to happen to him? What he needs is more than I can do. But you know how to do it. You know how to help him. I didn't know what to expect coming here. I knew it wasn't gonna be easy, but I didn't have a choice. It's... it's... You're pathetic. You owe me for what happened, Warren. You owe me much more than my life. [Speaking Thai] It's already been 47 days. Not a lot of time left. Why are we here? To be sure. You mean you don't know what's wrong with me? I don't have to convince myself. It's you who needs to be sure. You and me, we'll always be just visitors here. We have to learn to believe what they already know. What time was the crash? I don't know exactly, but in the police report, it says that the accident happened before 8:00. Jesus. Nothing about this is gonna be easy. I think now is the time when you should take a look. Nothing. There's nothing. Wait for it. [High-pitched tone] [Tires screeching] [Loud crash] Keep watching. No. What is it? What do you see? I see me. Som. [Retching] What's going on? How could I be there? I'm alive. It's all right there in front of you. Think about it. Sense it. What you feel for your family... Goes deep, very deep. It was your soul that stayed with them. You're holding on to two places at once. You won't let them go. That's why the shadow world can touch you. That's why your body is dying. There's got to be something that we can do. Warren... if there's anything that we can do to help him, we have to try. Hundreds of years ago, they learned that many forms of sickness and death were caused by the asuragai. They're demons that entered your body and possessed you. In those days, they would send the sick people off to live by themselves in these villages so the asuragai couldn't hurt others. As is often the case, the separation or wall between us and the shadow world is thin in places when there's been intense suffering. This is why the maw phi made a kind of sacred barrier that keeps the worlds apart. It's sealed from this side. But the seal can be broken. So it's a way through to the shadow world. It is a way to go over, rejoin yourself, and come back. But it's... dangerous... Especially for you, Jeff. The asuragai collect in places where the divide is thin, hoping to somehow escape. The temple will keep them from us, but they'll be able to get through to you, just like the ghosts that touched you, only worse. What do we do to open the gate? The ritual can be explained, but Jeff can't do it all by himself. Someone has to hold the pathway open from this side long enough for Jeff to get back. That'll be you, Choi. [High-pitched tone] [Scraping] [Scraping and banging] [Yelling] He cut me. I can't breathe. He stabbed me. Help! I can't breathe. No, no, no. No. No, it's over. He's gone. Where... Where am I? It's all right now. You can go. You can go. Jeff? Jeff? It's all right. He'll be fine. What happened? The woman from the hall, he... he... he spoke to her. He made her leave. You've done this before? She found her way through. She used Jeff. And even if there was another way, it wouldn't matter. They're everywhere. There are countless numbers of them. You live with this as long as I have... You realize you're never really gonna make a difference. It's the 48th day. What does that mean? Seven days times seven weeks is how long a spirit stays on Earth before its fate is sealed. So I only have until tomorrow? Your body will be gone. Your soul will be trapped with your family in the shadow world. We need to get going. I'm guessing we'd never find this place on a map. It's not hard to find. It's just hard to get to. Here, Mae Noi's tea. She really never told us how you knew each other. I knew her sister. She has a sister? I can't believe she never told me she has a sister. I mean, she's my second cousin's aunt on my stepfather's side, but still. Second cousin's aunt on your what? We have a big family. Jeff? Jeff, get up. Let's go. What's going on? We go on foot from here. [Speaking Thai] [Speaking Thai] This is Choi, and this is Jeff, the man we came to take to the spirit village. [Speaking Thai] We will prepare you tonight for your final journey tomorrow. And here you will find food and a place to rest. Thank you. You have some very impressive friends. Just be open to what they have to offer. [Thunder booming] [Men speaking Thai] I was kind of getting used to this look. It looks much better on you. Yeah, right. You know, I don't know a lot of people like you, who would come here and do all of this. I suppose I should have known all along that you'd do whatever it takes to help a patient. It is a sign of great strength that you decide to return there today. It's not strength. It's the least I can do for her sister. I know it's hard to see it now, but helping Jeff can be an opportunity. To what, fail again? Asuragai tricked you. I was weak. I let myself be deceived. Losing her was my fault. Nevertheless, today will be an opportunity for you. It is your choice what you decide to do with it. Our students have packed all that you will need. I will make sure all your belongings are kept safe. He's trying to tell you that there's nothing you can bring with you. There's no possessions. We only have ourselves from here on out. Thank you for everything you've done now and before. You're welcome. [Speaking Thai] Good luck. [Speaking Thai] [Speaking Thai] We're getting close. [High-pitched tone] Don't. Stay focused. Once they know you can be drawn to them, they'll know they can get to you, and that would be much worse than the wound on your arm. They're flesh eaters. You know so much about this. It's not just stories you read in a book. You've obviously been here before. Mae Noi's sister... We had a baby, a daughter. There was an accident. Her soul stayed with our daughter. I came here to save her. The pathway closed before she could come back. And what makes you think that... that this time would be any different? We don't really have another option. Avoid the shadows. Stay in the light. They can't touch you there. And remember, don't let them know they can distract you. Go. Just go through it. Keep looking straight ahead. That's good. You're doing good. The temple's in the center. Come on. The shadows are only getting longer. Stay in the light. Stay in the light. That's it. Stay in the light, Jeff. No, no, no. Wait. [Indistinct whispering] Go ahead, Choi. Go. Wait. It's okay. Go now. Now go. Go. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep going. Keep moving. Come on. Come on. Jeff! [Yelling] Can you walk? Yeah. Come on. You'll be okay here for now. We have to hurry. There's not much time. The shadows will be in place soon. Choi, you'll be here. When the steps on the other side of the arch are covered in shadow, then the pathway can be opened. After they're open, how long will we have after that? Until the shadow reaches the top of the arch. It's about seven minutes. Seven minutes? Jeff. I'll try, okay? Promise. Okay. It's okay. Choi. This will protect you from the light, Choi. Now close your eyes. You're gonna see things, and you're gonna feel things no one should feel. No matter what happens, don't open your eyes, and don't move from here. If you do, the pathway will close. What am I going to feel? The asuragai will do everything in their power to trick you. They will make you feel as if they are harming you, but it's not real if you don't open your eyes... And don't move. No matter what happens, don't take your mind off Jeff. Turn your palms up. Okay, it's time to begin. [Whispering in Thai] [Gasps] It's ready. Rejoin yourself. Come back as soon as you can. [All snarling and growling] [Yelling] Someone's coming. It's Jeff. Jeff? Don't move. You can't trust this. Please, help me. Please. He... he needs me. No, Choi. Don't trust what you see, only what you feel. [Coughing] Choi, please. No. Just don't move. Don't open your eyes, and it won't be real. [Snarling] [Whimpering] [Yelling] [Sizzling and screeching] [Gasps] I'm here. I'm here. Jeff. I'm here. Daddy? Daddy, you came back. Kyle, honey, I did. It's gonna be okay. I'm here for you now. I'm here. Something's wrong. It's Jeff. I can feel he... What? He won't leave them. He won't let go. Choi. Choi, you have to go in after him. It's meant for you. Don't you see? Your connection with him, it's the only thing that's kept him alive all this time. Now go. Go. Hurry. [All snarling and growling] No! [Yelling in Thai] Where's the baby? I was weak. I let myself be deceived. No, Warren! [Groans] You have to let us go. No, no. We're together. I don't have to go anywhere. We can stay together. We will be, just not now, not like this. You know we don't belong here, and neither do you. [Echoing] Jeff! Jeff! You have to come back! There's no time! Go to her. She won't leave here without you. She'll die here for you. It's going to be okay, Daddy. Really, it is. I'm with Mommy now. I'll make sure she's fine. You're a big boy, aren't you? Jeff, please! [Snarls] I'll always need you. And I'll always need you. Jeff! [All snarling and growling] Jeff, please! Choi. Come on. Ah! [Screaming] Jeff! [Screams] - Choi, take my hand! - Jeff! Daddy, it's me. Hurry. Jeff? I'm here. Choi? We did it. We made it back. Warren, it's time to leave. I'm staying. Your eyes... you should have a doctor look at them. I'm fine. Listen, Ajaan Sao has agreed to help me... Find her, put her to rest. We'll be back to check on you. [Sobbing] [Speaking Thai] [Speaking Thai] [Speaking Thai] [Both speaking Thai] Welcome back.
