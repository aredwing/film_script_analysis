Keep quiet, l'm right. - You don't say without knowing, l'm right. You're going repeating the same. - No, l'm right. l'm right. - No, l'm right. What's the argument between you two? Pankajam asked where Rama & Seetha would've celebrated their first Deepavali? l said everyone will celebrate in bride's parent's home. So, l said they would've celebrated it in Mithila, and Mallika is refusing my contention. How could they've celebrated in Mithila? They went to forest in exile immediately after their marriage. They would've celebrated it in the forest. How can they celebrate it in the forest? Coming back from exile after 14 years, they would've celebrated in Ayodhya. No, in Mithila. - No, in the forest. - No, in Ayodhya. Excuse me, may l? We've read that epic, but still we're confused. You're a Christian. How can you answer it? l'll tell you, if l'm wrong, forgive me. - Go ahead. Aunt, Krishna's incarnation comes after Rama. We're celebrating the death of Narkasuran as Deepavali. There was no deepavali in Rama's time. Then, how could they've celebrated it? You're very knowledgeable about Hindu festivals, though you're a Christian. Hubby, you wouldn't mind if l say something, would you? - Go ahead. Julie's arrival has proved a boon to me. She does all the household work. She takes care of children also. Your brother & Julie are childhood friends. They like each other. lf we get them married... l'm also toying with that idea. People are rubbishing them. Before it amplifies we must nip it in the bud. What do you say father? Julie & Ashok must decide not me. Let's ask them. No, you've misunderstood us. Julie & l are friends from our childhood. Friends don't always end up as lovers. We're friends till this minute, ...and will remain friends all our lives. Okay, let's keep it like that. Shouldn't friends marry? No, after marriage, wife & husband can be friends. But, friends shouldn't become man & wife. lt'll be an insult to friendship as well as marriage. Love can germinate at first sight. Love could develop even without seeing. But you can't be friends at first sight. You can't be friends without meeting. You must meet, talk and move closely with each other. Only then it'll develop. Everyone will not be that lucky. We're lucky. Please don't disturb it. Did you see? Today's generation is very clear in their thinking. We couldn't differentiate between Love & friendship and got confused. l'm really proud of you both. First we started as friends. Later we fell in love. Without saying in that sequence. You're saying you'll remain friends forever. l'm proud of it. l believed others but failed to trust my own brother. l'm sorry. Your family failed to understand our friendship. How can others understand it? What if we put a full stop to all those doubts? How? Why don't you marry? Playing the fool with me? No. lf you marry, then no one will doubt our friendship. You can marry for that. How can l marry before you marry? Love, l'm not saying, l'll not marry & stay with you always. l'll definitely marry. Just think about this. You try to find a groom for me. lf they ask you, who am l? What will be your reply? Would they believe if you say l'm your friend. lf you go to find a groom for me with your wife, no one will pick holes in it. lf l have to marry you must get married first. That'll be the best way. lf you want me to be happy then you get married first. Okay, if my wife suspects our friendship. With your nobility you'll never get a suspicious wife. Let's be positive in our thinking. lt's time, shall we go now? All of you please sit down. Sit closely. Ready. Who's that? Move away. Standing as a road block. ldiot. Ready...Ready...Smile.

You call him as you like when l'm not there. l don't have any objection. Nobody has understood our friendship. Everybody is bad mouthing us. Do you say that nobody will badmouth if you part? Only now they'll badmouth you people more, saying, there was some affair between you both, and as soon as his wife came and learnt about it, that girl left the house. Or else they'll badmouth me for separating friends as soon as l came. They only know to blame and not to appreciate. Will he lead a happy life with me if you part? l'll be happy only if you're there.

You and Julie are friends from childhood. l don't know what was the reason for you to get married first. What will that girl think about you? She'll think that she would've been long married if her parents were alive. Having Julie with us, if we celebrate first night & beget children... Would this look nice? Won't our conscience prick us? What are you trying to say... Why don't we have our first night after Julie's marriage? Hubby, did l say anything wrong? No...Even l was about to tell you the same. But l didn't know how to begin, but you broke the ice! Thanks Nandhini! Not only a friend, l've got a good wife also. l'm really very lucky. Where are you going? - l'll sleep outside. Why should you? You sleep here. Julie is alone, l'll join her in the next room. Give...Give it, good night. - Yes, good night. Hey why did this bride come here at this time? According to my horoscope, l & my husband shouldn't consummate for a year, that's why we've postponed our first night. Don't tell this to anybody, please... Good night. - Good night. Hey, why such a big pimple on your face? lt is natural. Shit! A blemish on your beautiful face! Wait. Come here, sit...l say sit.

But you...it's okay if you don't do facial for me, did you at least get me ''Fair and Lovely cream''? His wife is beautiful so he's giving her facial & admiring her beauty. You're looking at your face in the mirror daily, aren't you? Go and attend your work. Even after make up, donkey can't be changed into a horse? Go. Look how beautifully he's frank incensing her hair. lt won't make any difference to this hair. Little... Enough... - One sip please... Look how they're fondling... Very lucky pair!

He was going on the side of the road, one auto driver hit him. Don't know whose face he saw in the morning. Hubby, where's the scooter? l'm severely wounded. Don't ask me all that. But ask about the scooter. Only then you could sit behind and come smilingly to the movies, Oh god! How's this? - Take out that olive green! This white shirt will look nice on Ashok, isn't it? No...This green will suit him better. Shit...He doesn't like green. He doesn't have an olive green T.Shirt. He will like only this. No...White is his favourite. - Shall we see? Okay?

Only Rs. 99. - Yes, it's a reasonable price? lt's okay! Oh god, l left my handbag there. l was afraid you might choose my selection. Thank god! You chose your wife's selection. Because all the wives will feel proud that they know their husbands well. lf they feel otherwise, then they'll become upset. You correctly chose Nandhini's selection. You were equally prudent. l should choose Nandhini's selection, so you wantonly showed me a white coloured shirt which l dislike, and said that's my favourite colour. Okay Nandhini is coming. Shall we move? - Yes. Go to an ice-cream parlour! Keep these boxes down. - Sure! Cheers. - Cheers. l've also seen...but l've not seen such friendship. Do you both plan when you leave the house, Or plan on the spot? For Ashok to choose the shirt l selected, You both enacted a wonderful drama. You showed the white colour which he dislikes saying that's his favourite. He also understood and chose the green coloured shirt that l selected. l know that he doesn't like green colour too. You both think alike! No, that's... l'm jealous. Can't l be you! Believing in your friendship, Not only Rs 100, l can even bet for 1 crore.

Julie, who lives in my house & your son are in love. Do you know about this or not? - l know. Only yesterday my son told me about this. That's why, we've come to discuss about their marriage. What's the relation between you & Julie? Julie is my friend. - Friend means... l & Julie studied together from childhood. After her father passed away, she's living in my house. She has no one other than us. Many millionaires daughters are in a queue for my son. Leaving all of them... Julie is an ordinary middle class girl. Why should l make her my daughter-in-law? Tell me. They both love each other sincerely. Okay. lf l make her my daughter-in-law, because of my son's wish, do you know what all l'm going to lose? My status in the society will come down. lf l make millionaire's daughter as my daughter-in-law, Kinsman will help me in my business. l'll miss that. Okay l'm ready to sacrifice all this. What will you sacrifice? What do you want me to do? You've been selected in the lndian team. You must quit. You must write a letter to the cricket board saying that, you're not interested in cricket & asking them not to select you in the team. Do you want to know what l'm going to gain from this? Cricket is more than your life for you. lt's the same for Michael. He's confident that he'll be selected in the lndian team. lf he comes to know that he hasn't been selected, he'll die. So, if you step down, he'll get selected. Because he's next in the order. lf Julie has to marry Michael, you must quit from the team. Now the ball is in your court. lf you say that you're not interested to play, They'll never select you again. Don't bind yourself with this condition. People had insulted you. You must show them who you're, isn't it? Don't you feel ashamed to roam aimlessly? He asks his father & brother for his pocket money. Who'll get his daughter married to him? You're an ordinary videographer, eat later. Okay sir. l'll quit from the team. Another condition. l acknowledge the friendship between you & Julie and but my relatives won't. The day Julie & Michael get married, you should neither talk nor meet Julie. lt'll be good for the Julie's married life. What're you thinking? l can live without seeing Julie, but she can't live without seeing me. l don't know what you'll do, you must do something to make Julie show aversion on you. Okay as you say sir. Go. l'll discuss with Father & fix the marriage by next week in the church. Are you not happy with what l said? Even l want my husband to become popular. lt's alright. l feel proud to be a wife of a good human than of a famous cricketer. That's more than enough. Thank you very much Nandini.

Don't fail to attend my marriage, because you're with me. l've no one else other than you Ashok. lf you get time phone me once in 2 days. lf not, phone me once in a month. l can't live without talking to you. l'll take leave, Ashok. Bye Nandini. You won't mind me if l say something, will you? Tell me. l can't live without seeing or talking to Julie. Why don't we leave this place? l've a friend in Bombay. He has asked me to come to Bombay & promised to get me a job. Shall we go to Bombay? You pack all our clothes. l'll tell them to sell the video shop & give the money to Julie. ls it? Okay...okay. One second. Mike, on the occasion of your being selected to the National Team........ Lion's club is organizing a felicitation for you in Coimbatore. lt'll be telecast live in the T.V. Do you have any programme in the evening? No daddy, l'll attend the evening programme. Tell them l'll be coming after going to church. l may be little late. Sir, we'll be there at 6 0'clock. Michael will be coming late, okay? Thank you sir for selecting my son. You said it very casually. l know the difficulties l went through to get Michael selected. Since Ashok refused. The Delhi board member wanted to bring his State player. The Haryana member wanted his State player to be selected. l got almost fed up managing all those people. How did you make Ashok withdraw? Julie who stays in his house & Michael love. lf Michael has to marry Julie, l made it as a condition that he must withdraw from the team. He withdrew. Julie will someday come to know about this, won't she? She mustn't come to about this forever. l told him to cut the friendship with Julie. He has done it. You're the No.1 business man. Come Michael everybody is waiting for you. Hello sir. - Welcome Michael. No thanks take them back. l garland Michael D'Souza on behalf of Coimbatore cricket association. Ladies & gentlemen, you all know the purpose of this function. Michael D'Souza of Tamilnadu has been selected in lndian cricket team. This function is to felicitate him. Michael D'Souza needs no introduction. He dedicated his life for the cricket. His selection to lndian team is the reward for his talent. Many play cricket but everyone can't get selected in the lndian team. Because cricket is a tough game. Timing sense & concentration are very important. They should've good knowledge about game's nuances. Apart form all, they should dedicate themselves. Michael D'Souza has all these qualities. lt's neither surprise nor wonder that he has been selected to the lndian Team. Next, l'll request Michael D'Souza to say few words. Thank you. Thanks a lot. You ought to be man to honoured & felicitated. Yuck! Michael is Julie's future husband. Julie will feel proud if Michael becomes famous. lf Julie lead a happy life we'll be happy right? Greetings to everyone. My father is responsible for this felicitation & applause. Fathers generally say 'study in the morning'. But my father asked me to practice cricket. l got a chance to play for district while writing my +2 exams... l was in a dilemma whether to write exam or play the game. l asked my father's opinion. Any other father would've asked to write exam saying education is important. But my father never said like that. ''Go & play the match you can write the exams next year''. He said so, he was always a source of strength for my growth. Let's go. There's still some more time. Let's listen what Michael says. You may have magnanimity to hear & appreciate his words. But, l don't have... Let's go & sit in the train. My father is responsible for my selection in the cricket team. My father who bought everything which l wished from his childhood, Now he presented this gift without asking for it. Are you asking me, ' how's it possible'? l wasn't selected for my talent. l got it from someone else's withdrawal. You praised me a lot. l don't deserve all that praise. There's someone else who deserves it. He's none other than Ashok. Yes, Ashok was the one who got selected to the team. But, my father bought him for price. Do you know how he had bought? Julie, who is standing there, lf l want to marry Julie, he should withdraw from the team. My father had put such a condition to Mr.Ashok. Ashok gave up his life's ambition for Julie's welfare. One may sacrifice anything for his friend. But, the ambition achieved after shedding much sweat & blood since childhood. No one will be ready to sacrifice that. But, Ashok sacrificed even that & honoured the friendship. Julie is very lucky to get such a friend. Not only that my father laid a condition to him that he shouldn't be friendly with Julie. He lived & sacrificed for Julie. He wantonly spoiled his fair name with Julie & has now gone into oblivion. Just now, l came to know the truth. lf l had known it earlier, l would've not accepted to it. l'm sorry Julie. l'm not responsible for my father's mistake. l humbly request selection committee members present here. l don't like to be selected at the cost of someone's sacrifice. lf l play with these guilt feelings, l'll not be able to score properly. l'll withdraw myself from the team. Please, select Mr.Ashok. lt seems Ashok is leaving this place. Let's go & see in the station. You go & search Ashok. l'll park the car & come. Attention to the passengers. Cheran express to Chennai is ready to leave shortly from platform No.1. Wind! Fragrant Breeze will you recite a poem? Will you give your wings to me to fly in the sky? ls it to make flowers bloom, you come like gentle breeze? ls it to sing a song, you come as words? Friendship continues...
