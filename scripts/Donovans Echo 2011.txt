This place had quite a few renters over the years but when it was empty, you know, I made sure to keep the pipes drained and the furnace down low. Figured you'd let us know if you wanted to sell it. There's a fresh coat of paint in the living room. New phone, new answering machine. I picked up that beater out back for next to nothing. A friend of mine was giving it away so... it's not pretty, but it runs. Thanks. Look Donovan, I know this has got to be kind of strange for you, but uh... Susan, both of us, are so happy you finally decided to come back. You're family. Thanks Finn. Yeah. So I've got to get my day started, so I'll let you get settled in and uh, let us know about Saturday okay? Susan, she just can't wait to see you. Okay. - Alright. Post doctoral in '50, Doctor of Physics in '48. Los Alamos. The Manhattan Project? Yeah. 30 years though, that's quite a gap in your resume. I mean what have you been doing exactly? I just uh... moved around. Different things. Anyway, I'm interested in your introductory physics program. I'll tell you what I'm interested in. Your paper "Elements of Low Energy". Cold fusion, right? Yeah, that's over 30 years old. Typically a school like ours is funded through the government, tuition fees and so forth. But another source of revenue is through grants that our professors are able to bring in with their own research. Now, something like this... research into a cheap, abundant, renewable energy source... This is something we can get behind. I think... cold fusion has been debunked. Okay. Well, we'll certainly keep you in mind. Hi. I saw you still have lots of leaves in your yard and I was just wondering... - No thank you. It's only $5, and I'll do a really good job. Can I put you on my list? Let me see that. Hmph. So he wishes me luck on my interview, and about 20 minutes later in the parking lot he pulls up, sirens just blaring, leans in and says "You know I'm going to have to arrest you for stealing my heart". Thank you so much, thank you so much. But no, bad puns aside, it's been an amazing journey no regrets. Drink, be merry. And if you're driving, just be merry! And have cake! Hey stranger. You manage to settle in yet? It's a work in progress. Oh, well then maybe I'll come over tomorrow and help you unpack. No thanks, I'll be fine. I could at least throw some roses in a vase. Put some pictures up? Give the place a woman's touch. No. - I just.. - No, no! I've got to go. Divide by 100. March 10th, 1941. Magic! Math! - Hey Kaisha. The old birthday bit? Still a good bit. I thought you uh... had a party to host. Oh we wrapped that up early. Just can't pull all nighters like we used to. Oh, speaking of birthday bits... You forgot your gift. Not my birthday yet. Close enough. You know Susan would have me giving out Christmas presents in July if I let her. You know, we're going out to the cemetery tomorrow to visit Jasmine and Magnolia, bring some flowers. If you're up to it you're welcome to... I'm sorry. You know, I just thought you'd come back because you didn't want to run anymore. Is that what I'm doing? Thought I was drinking! Okay now, we don't see you for years at a time, we don't really even know if you're still kicking and... really Don, why are you back? I don't know. 30 years, Don. This is not the life she would've wanted for you. Well we all can't be pillars of the community, can we? Thanks for the lecture don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out. Have a good walk home. Kaisha! Hey! Hey! Hey Kaisha! No! You suffered one heck of a trauma. Technically you had a mild heart attack. Kaisha... His car was broad-sided by a truck. Is he okay? He was pronounced dead at the scene. It was a hit and run. You were very lucky you weren't struck. Oh, Jesus. I'm very sorry. I could have stopped it... You need to take these warning signs very seriously. I'm prescribing a beta-blocker to reduce blood pressure, and I'd like to run an ECG. Excuse me? The little girl and her mom. What happened? Are you family? She's my neighbor. Father was street racing... his truck flipped. Will he be okay? He just passed away. You know, I already made my statement Finn. Well okay, if you don't remember anything about the truck, tell me more about this hunch, you knew Kaisha was going to get hit? No. Like I said, I had a feeling that something was wrong. It was like a moment of clarity. It was as if it already happened as it was happening. I can't explain. You ever felt this kind of thing before? I don't know. Hey, I got it. No let me get it. Goddamnit, I said I got it! I'm... I'm sorry Finn. It's okay. If I hadn't been drunk, if I wasn't distracted, I would've reacted faster. You know, Kaisha's dead because of me. It's Jasmine and Magnolia all over again. There's nothing you could've done for him. Or for the girls. I mean, don't let this stay with you, y'know? - Yeah. - Just... you know, when you're ready... promise you're going to get some help. You know, whether you reach out to Susan, or to me or to whomever. It's just... because we want to help. Okay. I'll see you. Sobriety empowers us to handle situations that used to mystify us. When we see others overcoming problems not unlike our own, it gives us hope. Three months ago, Kit came home after a very long time. But packed in his bags he carried with him, both a problem and a promise. A promise of making some very big changes... that started with a meeting. I didn't want to come tonight. It's been a bad week. Just lost my brother in-law... he was a really good friend. Anyway, uh Ray said it'd be good if I came. Encourage some of you... Sorry I uh... chair's stuck. Hey, Kit! Kit! Please... join us. Would you like to introduce yourself? Donovan. Hi Donovan. Hi Donovan. Welcome, I'm Ray. Perhaps you'd like to share something about yourself? When was the last time you had a drink? It's been a while. Well, we're glad you came. Hey, buddy, Hey, buddy, Susan said you got a job at the grocery. That's great man. Listen, if any other details from the accident come to you. Anything at all, maybe jot them down, okay? Take care, later. November 9th, 1 964, my birthday. "Can't shake these strange thoughts. It's been a very peculiar week." November 4th, 1 964. ...strange feelings... ...scaffolding... ...dj vu... Donavan... A girl left this. Your total comes to $28.22 Who left it? Outside. Can you catch her? It's $28.22. Wow. Sounds like you deserve a raise. Absolutely! - You asked me if there's a reason I returned. I think I know. I told you I had... sensed something outside the restaurant. What, you mean with the accident? Yeah. I think I had the same feeling today. It was like a memory. I had these feelings before. Just before Jas and Magnolia left. Almost like premonitions. You think I'm crazy. No! No, no no. Jas and I had an aunt with intuition. What, you mean Amy? The one who was married four times? Her instincts told her when to leave! Intuitions about what? Well, like if she was thinking about somebody she might get a call from them. I don't know if intuition's the right word. More like deja vu. Thirty years ago Jas and I went to speak to Magnolia's teacher, Carol Mackenzie, about her report card. Then, all of a sudden it clicked. Was she hurt? No, nothing fell. But I recorded the event, right here. Right here. There. The exact same date, 30 years ago. So you thought Magnolia was in danger in '64, but she wasn't. But this girl today was! What does that have to do with you coming back? The other guy that was killed, the other street racer, the red truck... Yeah, Jason Waldgrave. You know him? No, no he ran a garage in town. And I heard he was a really nice guy. But he wasn't racing, he was there... Somebody broke into the garage. We figure Jason surprised him and he gave chase. Any suspects? No, I don't know. Jason's wife said there was a real pissed off customer last week, almost put his fist through a window. So we're trying to track him down but... Why? Do you remember what the make of the other truck was? No. But this Jason... I mean, he's the father of the girl that I saved and the same day as his accident, she stops by my house. You know that I'm not spiritual. For some reason I believe that I returned to look out after this girl. And what makes her so special? I don't know! It's just... Don, if you feel that you returned to save this girl then maybe that's exactly what you were meant to do. Yeah, and sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. I think I got a pretty good handle on how Jason ran things. Just might need some help entering work orders. Cops have any luck finding the asshole that smashed the window? Shouldn't be so hard to track this guy down. It's okay, we'll find him. You hang in there, and I'll let you get back at it. See ya later, kiddo. Bye Uncle Kit. Can I help you with anything? Uh, no... uh... Uh, yeah... maybe. Do you have any scientific case studies on maybe deja vu, patterns... recurring patterns? Oh, um... actually. This is new. Haven't read it but I believe it's sort of in the vein of what you're talking about. Feel free to take your time, my daughter can ring you through. You took off pretty fast yesterday. You knew that saw was going to fall, didn't you? No. You still in the raking business? I could use some help. I thought you said no soliciting. I said "no soliticing" 'Kay. That's pretty advanced math you're doing there. What are you, 12? 13? Uh... 17.385. 17 rounded down. Took off pretty fast yesterday. We were lucky you were there. Just next time, ask before you leave. Uh-huh. Oh, uh... stack them brand side out. Thanks. "Can't shake this feeling. What triggered it? Keeps replaying through my mind like an old memory. The bridge will collapse at 12:15 on November 6th. Midnight." Now, let's see... Andy Andreasen... ...design standards? Huh. Failed inspections. Can't build a load that long. Where is it? Ah, here we go. Hold it right there! Donovan? Hey, hey Finn! Hey. What the hell are you doing? I didn't want to wake you, I just wanted to... ...borrow your rake! Borrow a rake? Don't tell me you've been drinking. No, no I don't drink and drive. Well what're you doing breaking into my garage at 5 to 12? I didn't break into your garage! You always keep a spare key above the light. What do you mean, you're going to rake your yard in the middle of the night? No, the girl is coming by tomorrow and I didn't have a rake. The girl? What girl? What, the Waldgrave girl? What's going on? She's trying to raise some extra money for Barbie dolls, hula-hoops, I don't know. Why didn't you call me, it's the middle of the night! I didn't want to wake you up. Tell Susan good night. I appreciate it Finn! What the hell are you doing? This is why you broke into my garage? It's the date! You need your head examined. The bridge design in '64... it was all wrong Finn! Oh yeah, is this another one of your hunches? Now, now just listen. Thirty years ago tonight I made a note that the Junop Bridge would collapse at 12:15 AM on November 6th. 12:15... Where'd you pull that number out of? Three other bridges built with the same standards all failed inspection. This is, this is insane Donovan! They inspect the bridge every year, they obviously haven't found a problem. Yet! I thought you said all your psychic horse shit had to do with this Waldgrave girl. What's she got to do with this? Damnit Finnley! I don't know, but you've got to trust me! It's almost like I already see it in the news. Oh, come on! That bridge will collapse at 12:15 AM tonight! That's two minutes! Finn! That's two minutes! Damnit Finn just listen! Get out of the way Donovan! Damnit! Finn! Come on! Don't go! Are you out of your mind?! Come on Finn, please get off the bridge! Come on Finn, please get off the bridge! It's not going anywhere! By the way, it's 12:16! Get some help! What is it Donovan? Talk to me. Morning of the trinity test, it's like the sun just crashed down into the desert. I can't have my greatest contribution to this world be an instrument of death. You've created some beautiful things Donovan. Gentlemen... We're here to create an atomic bomb. Oh Christ! Not on top of tomatoes. Not on top of tomatoes. And are you a Super Saver Club card holder? .. and for you star watchers out there grab your blankets tonight, one of the best meteor showers of 1994 is scheduled to begin in a sky near you shortly after 9 PM... So let's focus here... Kind of dark out, isn't it? Your mom know you're out? She's still at the store. Well, it's pretty late. You won't see any meteors but at least the view's better. Wow. Beautiful. I learned that in astronomy club. Is that where you got your pin? My dad gave it to me. Ah. Sounds like a pretty great dad. I heard what happened. I'm sorry. I know what it's like to lose people you love. I um... I should probably go. Time for a new bag! This looks familiar. Your mom recommend these to you? I just borrowed them. Pretty heavy stuff. What does she have to say about all these topics? Just take what you like and leave the rest. She says that we're all energy, and since energy doesn't disappear, Dad will always be with us. What do you think? I think that's a poor excuse for a Fall jacket. Let's get something warmer and get you home. Come on. So what was that math you were working on the other day? It's for a science fair project. Pretty complex for an 11 year old. I sometimes have problems with algebra. I sometimes get my letters and my numbers mixed up. My D's and P's, my 6's and 9's. Always done better just doing the math in my head instead of writing it down. I think that's called dyslexia. Is that so? So what's your science project about? It doesn't matter. I'm not entering anymore. It's starting! Yeah! You know, I realized I don't know your name. I'm Donovan. I'm Maggie. Short for Magnolia. Ahhhh! Ah, Donovan! Get back! Get gone! Get back! Are you alright? Let me see. Excuse me, I'm looking for my daughter Magnolia Waldgrave. I was told she was here. Oh my God! Sweetie! Oh, my God, what happened? What happened to your arm? Are you... I'm just a friend. I'm sorry, who are you? Maggie was uh, raking my leaves... She was raking your leaves? Maggie what were you doing out? She seems to have quite the business going. Magnolia! Who's leaves are you raking? Just his. What the hell is this? Just a book she had with her. You were in my store. Is that when you asked her to come to your house? She's an 11 year old girl! He didn't do anything, he was just carrying them for me. Mrs. Waldgrave. Excuse me, but can I explain to you what we did for Magnolia? Yes. Yes. Sorry. Let's talk this way. Yeah! No, I know. It's in the garage. What do you want now, you going to break another window? I wanted to apologize. Hey, and this ought to cover your windshield. Post dated. A month. Got a minute? Yeah, if you're quick I got some stuff I want to do. I learned that little girl's name last night. Maggie. Short for Magnolia. I know you think I'm crazy but something is happening. It's a parallel. Like I was trying to tell you the other night, 30 years ago I had a bad feeling about the Junop Bridge. Somehow I knew it was going to collapse. Now, I can't explain it. I'd worked with Andy Andreasen and I knew he was the engineer on this project. So I called him, and he said he would look into it. For some reason it didn't show up on the inspection report. This feeling, is still the same feeling, 30 years to the day. I... I'm not following this. In '64, Magnolia's teacher was Carol Mackenzie. Maggie Waldgrave's teacher is Mackenzie Carol. What if history is somehow repeating? Nothing's repeated. Nothing. I mean, 30 years ago you imagined a bridge collapsing. It still hasn't collapsed. Finn, listen. No, you listen. You also thought something was going to drop on Magnolia. And nothing happened. But it happened to this girl! Look, I'm done. I don't have time for this. Hey, Finn. Look at this. Donovan, I can't. This is an old key from my diary. Maggie's mother gave me this book. The entire bookstore and she put this in my hand! It's a snake biting its tail. It's called an Ouroboros. It represents a cycle that begins as soon as it ends. And this! This image has been burning in my mind since the day Jas and Magnolia died. There's something... I don't, I don't know what's happening! But obviously it has something to do with the upcoming anniversary of their death. Yes! It does! Which you've got to let go! It was a kid on a joyride that killed your family. Not you. Give this up. I'm not just telling you this as a friend. This is slippery ground you're on. I got... thanks for the coffee. Hi. I uh, just wanted to apologize. Maggie explained that she was the one who came by. I'm Sarah. Donovan. How is she? She's fine. Well, her arm is. She's uh, going through a rough time. Yeah, I heard. Sorry for your loss. It's got to be rough on the two of you. It is. Especially her. Yeah, she told me she was dropping out of her science fair. Her father had been helping her with her project at the garage. She forgot it there and when he went back to go get it he must have interrupted the break in. He chased after them. She's in a vulnerable place right now and asking a lot of big questions so... I would appreciate if you please leave the spiritual discussions to me. Thank you. No offense but it doesn't look like you're much of a mechanic. You should bring it by Waldgrave's garage, on Dunlop. Tell my brother Kit that I sent you. He'll cut you a deal. That's very kind of you, thanks. Let me know how it goes. Look, there's fluid all down the side of the Ram. No, I got a stuck vehicle man! How long? Two days? Yeah, just... send it. What are you doing here? I was talking with Sarah... Sarah? No, it's fine. She came by. We cleared the air. Anyway, she told me to bring my car in. Transmission I think. You're the mechanic. Okay. Uh, we've met before? No shit. No, not at the hospital or A.A. it was... your face. There was blood. Wasn't me. You'll have the car next Wednesday. You know, your niece... She's a very special girl. Is there a problem? Look, you might have charmed Sarah but I'm not buying it. I don't want you anywhere near my niece! Hey, Don! Robin wants to see you out front. He's pretty pissed. - Huh. Okay. We'll honour those of you are already in line, but otherwise the steaks are... they're $9 a pound, they're not 6. No, no! It was only for those of you who already had steaks in line that the honour... I told you $9 a pound! Not $6! Are you the one ripping the labels off our inventory? What the hell is this? None of your damn business! Oh, okay. You're done! You can pick up your last check when you return your uniform. Keep it, and buy yourself some more hair gel. How's your arm? It's Itchy. - I had a talk with your mom. She's really concerned about you, and all that heavy reading material you've been carrying around. Yeah well, Mom has a lot of ideas but no answers. Well you have to be patient with her. She's dealing with a lot too. Listen, you cannot blame yourself. When someone you love passes on, the only thing you can do is keep moving forward. So you ask yourself, how am I going to move forward? You should enter the science fair. Life doesn't offer many big moments where our talent is recognized. You know what happens when you don't take a chance? Nothing. I like science. If you entered, I'd love to stop by. Check it out. Okay. Well, what is this project anyway? Alternative energy sources. Good for you! Maybe there is some hope for the future. At least this one can't break like last year's. What was that, a volcano? No... a popsicle stick bridge. A bridge? I used some of great grandpa Andy's designs. Andy... Andreasen? Yeah. He built Junop Bridge. I thought Junop Bridge was going to collapse the other night. Your bridge, how did it break? Nathan dropped a rock on it. See you tomorrow. Yeah, come in! I got your message. Hey, I want to show you something. What's this about the Waldgrave accident? You find the suspect? No, we haven't found him yet. Then what's this? Before we get to this... You mentioned Maggie Waldgrave's teacher. Yeah, Mackenzie Carol. What about her? It's MacKenna. MacKenna Carol. What? Yeah. I want you to see something else. Hey, you got it. Yeah, it's the security camera from the store. There, do you see what you did? Yeah, you see? No, just... I'll rewind it. Watch your hand. You caused the accident. Bullshit. The saw fell when you grabbed the scaffolding. You made it happen. No I didn't! You weren't there. The saw was already falling. I saved her! That girl is in danger and I know the answer lies in this journal. Look what you're doing! You're searching for connections that don't exist. The names don't match, the bridge didn't fall, and you jerked the scaffolding! Don, I'm just... I'm worried. I think you're creating these connections as a way to, I don't know, deal with these unresolved emotions that you're in denial of. An impressive diagnosis. Finn is a hell of a loss for the psychiatric community! Just try again here. It's just... Oh shit! Your past is an anchor holding you down. You've done your time. She needs you now. She needs Jason, not me. He was a good man. But he's gone, and you're still here. Now, this is an opportunity for you to be the brother, the uncle, that she thinks you're capable of being. It's time to forgive that young boy. Kit! Kit! Oh, hey Donovan. Are you looking for a meeting tonight? There's one tomorrow. Everything okay with him? You know Kit? Enough to see that he's got some demons. There's not a lot of alcoholics who don't have them. So uh, what brings you out tonight? Actually I'm the pastor here. Oh... Alcoholisim doesn't really discriminate. Since I'm here, you mind if I get your thoughts on something? Sure. This here. Have you seen this before? Yeah... it kind of looks like an heraldic cross. Yeah, it's a symbol for hope. Hope? The cross predates Christianity. It's an ancient figure, which represents the four elements. Earth, air, water, fire. You got a family, Donovan? What's that? I recognize when someone's experienced a loss. Was it the alcohol? Jesus. I mean... No. It's my work. There was some things I was involved with when I was a young man that I came to regret. I thought I could redeem myself. For 20 years it was an obsession. I practically pushed them out the door. Have you tried to make amends? Well I recently made a new friend, and I think she might be in trouble. I'm trying to figure out how I can save her. Trying to save others won't reunite you with your family. It's not really about redemption. It's about self-forgiveness. Remember Donovan, to live in the hearts of those we love, is never to die. What was that? See you tomorrow, huh? You didn't drop the bomb Donovan! But I participated. This could be a clean, cheap source of energy. But you need to recognize what you have right in front of you. Just give me one hour. Take the day. I'll see you at dinner. Happy birthday. Hey! Hey. I thought I could show you how to enter the work orders. Computers huh? So no worldwide web for you? Listen, maybe don't worry about this whole work order thing. I got this opportunity out East. What's the opportunity? It's a, uh, trucking company and um... you know, I'd have to wrap up these last couple of jobs today but I would leave tomorrow. Wow, some things never change. What am I supposed to do Kit? Look Sarah, I've been talking to some people and I think you could get a really good price for this... It's just Maggie. It's not safe. She's fine. No, it's the lift. I've got to replace the rotted seal. Maggie! Stay away from that. It's not safe back here. Come on. Maggie. Let's go. Look Sarah, this new job... it's not a sure thing yet. You know, I might stick around. Earth, air... Fire, water, Science Fair. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen! If I could have your attention please? We had a lot of impressive work here today but there was one student who really stood out. I'd like to announce the winner of this year's science fair... Maggie Waldgrave! Congratulations Maggie. Way to go! You came! Maggie, your project. The four elements. Why did you choose this? It's important. I was just kind of drawn to it. Did you use a symbol? A cross? What do you mean? Right here, the heraldic cross. It represents the four elements. I've never seen that before. You sure? Somewhere in your research? No? Sorry. I'm so proud of you my girl! Free passes to Science World! That's so cool. It's awfully thoughtful of you to come down. Oh no, the IMAX show ends tomorrow. You think we can go. Please? You deserve it. Let's see this medal of yours. Wow! It's pretty heavy. This is what Maggie wants to do for your birthday. She thought you'd really enjoy it. - Hey, let me drive you guys. I'd love to see the dinomax...thing, you know... - I think we need a girls' trip, thanks. Hey guys, we're going to take some photos now. Maggie you can't go tomorrow! Excuse me? Maggie! No, no you can't go Maggie! Let her go! It's about the cross! It's a warning! Listen to me. I want you to leave my daughter alone. No, no listen to me, Sarah! Listen to me! No, you listen to me. You stink like booze, you've been filling her head with who knows what? If you go tomorrow, you'll die! Oh no, no, no. Listen to me. Listen to me! Sir, settle down! Sarah! Maggie! Maggie, please don't go! What's the story? Is he alright? Hey. Hey, Finn! You've got to help me convince them. Oh, Don... No, no, no. Tomorrow's the 9th. My birthday! The same day that... God damnit! Just stop! Please, please Finn! You've got to find Jasmine and Magnolia and tell them... Jasmine? Listen to yourself. Look what you're doing. That's not your wife and daughter. You need help, Don. I'll come in and check on you in the morning. Finn? I realize I might be crazy. But I know I didn't cause that saw to fall. I saved her at the store. You still awake, sweetie? Big day. What's wrong with him? Donovan? I think he's hurting. He said he lost someone. I think he had a girl. You mean the jacket you borrowed? You know, sometimes people deal with their pain in unhealthy ways. Maybe they take things to try to help it go away but it only makes it worse. Sometimes they believe things that aren't real. What do you think is real? I don't know sweetheart. But I know that your daddy would've been so proud of you today. I wish he was there. Me too. Going back a few days here. I don't know if it'll have what you're looking for. What time of day did you say it was? 3:00. Back... back it up. Right there. Pretty fast for an old guy. One more time. Must've known it was falling. The city workers do their best to detour traffic towards the Dunlop bypass. When asked to comment, city officials pointed to records indicating that 30 years ago, the designer Andy Andreasen had raised concerns over the structural integrity of the bridge. A formal assessment at that time showed no visible signs of structural engineering faults or deterioration, and a mandated annual inspection since then has not revealed any indication for concern either. Once again, searchers are trying to confirm if anyone was on Junop Bridge when it collapsed, just after midnight. I sometimes get my letters and my numbers mixed up. My D's and P's, my 6's and 9's. Hello? Sarah? Thank God you're okay. It's Donovan. I was right! - I told you to stop bothering us. It happened. The bridge, the bridge that Maggie's great grandfather built, Junop Bridge! I thought it was going to be the 6th but it was today! Something's happened, I can't explain. I'm going to go now. Hang on. Maggie's scratch... I saved her! The saw that fell at the grocery store. That's not what happened. I know it sounds strange. I'm trying to figure it out. Listen, the truck from Jason's accident... Don't. I've seen it! I was there! A black truck. With lights on the roof. Donovan? When I saw it, I saw a vision of Maggie... Put the phone down! Donovan! She was crushed slow. We're leaving now. Don't make me call the police. Wait, wait, wait! Sa-Sarah? Oh shit! God damnit. Oh Damnit! Donovan? I have someone that's in danger! I've seen it. I'm not crazy God damnit! Hey! It's okay. Can I just... give me a second. Finn! It collapsed! Don... Look here. The girls, man! Now look here, you've got to listen to me. We've got to do... Maggie... I believe you. I believe you. Sweetie, how did you get that scratch? You said it was at recess, right? A big saw fell at the grocery store and smashed by my bike. Donovan saved me. Excuse me? How long are we uh... Oh, we're trying to detour traffic as best we can, the bridge collapsed last night. Donovan said that would happen. What did you say? He knew it was going to collapse. Just like he knew the saw was going to fall. Did he mention anything else? Maybe a... a black truck with roof lights? No, but I saw one like that at the shop on the lift. Uncle Kit painted it silver but didn't do as good as a job as Dad. I can't put out an APB for them without sound reasoning, they're going to think I'm nuts. Uh... yeah, sorry. There's got to be a clue I'm overlooking. Something, maybe to do with her father's accident. Well what about the garage? You have their number? Hey, Finn! Woah, what do you think that means? Maybe... What if... What if these images and feelings, whatever, came to me 30 years too soon? Maybe provoked by similar dates and circumstances. A scaffolding accident that never happened. A feeling about a bridge before it was built. I thought this had to do with my research. This image came to me 30 years ago, today! The same... The same date my family died. It's always been this! Everything's about now. If I hadn't been preoccupied with this image, everything would've been different. Don... Don... Just... That Christopher Bailey kid killed your family, not you. Just try and stay focused. You think it's about the garage? Then we'll call them. Your past is an anchor holding you down. It's time to forgive that young boy. It's Kit! Christopher? You mean Jas and Magnolia? He was the kid driving the truck 30 years ago? That can't be right! Right after juvie his parents sent him off to live with relatives out East. As far as I know, he's still there. I don't know. They say at the A.A. he moved here three months ago. Finn! I think it's him. Buzz me out please! He hasn't been assessed by his doctor. Look, I don't have time for this. Just buzz me out! You can show me your Air Miles card sir, it doesn't change the policy. You want to take this up with the... Wait in the car, sweetie. I'll just be a few minutes okay? 'kay Kit? Hey! I thought you and Maggie were heading out. You know uh, I've never been to one of those IMAX shows. I hear they're pretty good. Whose truck is this? What's that? Whose truck is that on the lift? Oh, it's some guy that came in a while ago. It's actually someone that Jason was dealing with. It'd been stuck up on this broken lift for a while now. I tried to fix it but... Did you come to the garage that night? What? Did you come here to rob us? You broke in here... Sarah, why would you? ...and Jason caught you! Sarah. I'm in over my head. I have so much debt. I knew you guys had insurance, I wasn't trying to steal from you! Jason hired me, he was my friend. Why would he follow? You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! You killed him! Sarah! What is it? Someone's going to die. Wait here. No. Wait. No Finn, this is why I came. Wait. In the car. I'm calling the police. No! Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here? We're closed! Mrs. Waldgrave? You must be Christopher. Who the hell are you? I'm Sergeant Boyd. So what, you're going to arrest me now? Hey, you've just got to calm... Kit, stop it! Ahhhhh! Oh, my God Kit, what have you done? It was his gun, it was an accident. We need to call an ambulance! He needs help! Kit! Sarah, I didn't mean for this to happen! Kit! None of us did, Kit. Kit, put the gun down. You! You keep following me. What do you want? The same thing we both want. To forgive ourselves. You don't know me! You were just a young boy, 30 years ago today. You went for a joyride. Donovan, don't! What are you talking about? It was my family. My wife and daughter were in that car. Jasmine and Magnolia. It was an accident! I was just a stupid kid, it was just a dare! I couldn't show my face in this town, my own parents wanted nothing to do with me! It wasn't your fault my family died. Shut up! I paid my dues! It was my fault, Kit. I said shut up! Really, Don... why are you back? I'm trying to figure out what it means. It's a symbol for hope. I believe that I returned to look out after this girl. That's pretty advanced math that you're doing there. Alternative energy sources. Maybe there is some hope for the future! Ahhhhhh! Oh, God! Maggie! Oh my God! The individual I'm about to introduce, has changed our global outlook by reducing world dependence on nuclear energy, bringing us a new energy. A new way of life. A renewed hope for a nuclear free future. Expanding on the work of Doctor Donovan Matheson, please join me in showing our appreciation for the "mother of cold fusion", Doctor Maggie Waldgrave! There's hope, and it's you.
