Who's your favorite cartoon character? - Is this a trick question? - No. Seriously, who is it? Tigger. As in Winnie the Pooh? Yes, and Eeyore. He was so sad. And Piglet? Don't be an idiot. - Sorry. - Whatever. What is the point of this? What if you, Achmed, were animated? Me? A cartoon? - Right. - Like Tigger? - Sure. - That would be fantastic. Then wish for it. - What? - Make a wish. Oh, like, "I wish I were animated"? Perfect. - Hi, everybody. - Aah! I am Tinker Bubba. - What the- - Hi, Tinker Bubba. Howdy. Did I hear someone make a wish? Yep. That was Achmed. A wish? What wish? You said you wished to be intoxicated. - No, animated. - Oh, well, I can do that too. This is ridic- Ah! Oh! What happened to me? Why do I look like this? - Thank you, Tinker Bubba. - You're welcome. You infidel fairy. Toot-toot for now. Got to fly. Whoo-hoo! - You tricked me. - You got your wish. And why am I like this? It's for your new animated special, Achmed Saves America. Enjoy the show. Come back, Tinker Bubba! I will kill you. Oh, not a phone call while I'm riding. I have coverage all the way out here and not a cell tower in sight. Yes, yes. What? What? Achmed. Why are you still alive? Nice talking to you too. Wheel of Fortune! I should have heard a big boom by now. You have worked for us for three years, and you still haven't killed infidel one. I swear, you are the worst terrorist in the whole non-Muslim world. I am not. As a devout non-Muslim, I am offended by that. Are you forgetting you blew up a training camp? The only thing left was the monkey bars. Oh, please. We are so much better than them. Do not worry, Hassan. I will get it right this time. Achmed, focus! You're not losing your nerve, are you? No! Are you kidding? I'd be crazy not to want to kill myself. Then tell me why you are doing this mission. Because you told me to. Wrong answer! Why? Because I hate the infidel. And why do you hate the infidel? Because you told me to. Right answer. So don't screw this up. Why do you treat me like a fool? The bomb is ready to go. Oops. Huh? Hey- I'm alive. I failed! Son of a female dog. Well, it obviously can't get any worse than this. Huh! What the Hezbollah? Let me go, you flying jackal. Release me at once. Clutch me again! I was kidding! I was kidding! Well, that used to hurt. Wait. Where is this aluminum devil taking me? No! Mmm. Hmm. Hey. Death to America... ville. Terrorist log, hate date 7/3/13. I have arrived in the land of the infidels. It will only be a matter of time until-Aah! Oh, boy. I don't know what that was, but it made a doozy of a noise. I hope we hit something cool. Then this day wouldn't be a total loss. Whatever. Everyone's at the mall except me. And now my life is over. Well, I know we hit something, but darn if I know what it was. Turn around, asshat. Is that what we hit? Whoa! Is he dead? Can't we go now? No, honey. We have to help him. Here you go, buddy. You're fine. - You're gonna be fine. - Wait, stop. Let me give you a hand with that. - What are you doing? - Oh, that is a hand. Get your hands off of me. And the diaper goes on top, right? - Wait a minute. - That's a knee. I don't even touch myself there. - That's a... - What are you doing? - ...third knee. - Stop touching me! You put my ass in front! I'm sorry. I didn't see you. Oh, that makes me feel so much better. I guess we should exchange insurance information- Ooh. Oh, that looks like ours. - Ew! - Oh, Can we get you to a doctor or something? I want nothing to do with you. How I wish that evil airplane had never carried me from my homeland to this wretched America of yours. Mom, did you hear that? He said he just flew here. Maybe he's our exchange student. Yeah. Claude, the French kid we missed at the airport? I hate you, and I hate this country. Oh, yeah, he's French. We better stop him. Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. What? What? What? Ah! What devil is this? Bill, no. Bill? Seriously'? You give your dogs people names? What did you name your kids, Bubbles and Cujo? Billy, off! I'm sorry. He just likes you. Oh, great. When does the humping start? By any chance, are you Claude? Of course I am Claude. I'm clawed, scratched, bitten, licked, and humped, but mostly I am clawed. So you're saying you're Claude? Yes, you stupid American infidel. - That's wonderful. - What? Claude, we are your host family, the Wilsons, and we're so happy you're here. Are you infidels friendly or idiots or just friendly idiots? Sorry about the mix-up at the airport, but that is all over now. Let's get you to your new home. You're taking me to your cave? Well, I do have a man cave. It's the garage. Is he naked? Try not to make him feel bad, okay, honey? He's probably poor. Let's get you a hot meal first. We have the foreigner. Can we please go to the mall? I have moled myself, "first season of Homeland" style, among the enemy, the hated ones. These people who call themselves Wilson are cunning, though. They insist on treating me with respect and feeding me an obscene amount of food that I can barely keep down. I have the same problem. Their town is in terrible shape, and their lives are filled with emptiness and failure, yet they don't take the obvious route of blowing themselves and everyone around them up. What's up with that? I just work on the assembly line now, but my dream is to design the cars, like this. This is a gas-guzzling, obnoxious testament to everything the rest of the world hates about America. Exactly. It'll be a huge seller and save the company. If only my boss would look at it. He will, because it's perfect, honey, just like you. These are nothing like the Americans I was taught to hate, which makes me hate them more. Plus, I had no idea women could drive. Well, this is your home for the summer, Claude. It's cozy, but we love it. I am nauseated by the evil stench of decadence. - He did it. - Now, Kevin. Don't pick on our guest. He's had a long day. You know he was hit by a minivan. Why don't you and your sister go toss the football - or something? - Fine. I'm going to Angie's. Don't ignore your phone. It's not the phone I ignore. Kids today. In my land, they would have both been stoned by now. That's right. You French kids start drinking early, don't you? Wayne, remember our surprise. Oh, sure. Be right back. So now that I am deep in the bowels of the enemy, I will make it my mission to explode out a reeky, steaming vengeance, but how and when? Ta-da! Ah! Are you Catholic? No, we're American. Claude, you got here just in time for our town's 100th birthday celebration, and it's tomorrow! Ginny's in charge of the parade and the fireworks. It's going to be some show. Fireworks? Explosions? Large crowds? We'll fix your room up, Claude. You go ahead. I'll just be here innocently plotting and scheming. This is going to be easier than I thought. Stupid Americans. They always leave their dynamite just lying around. Let me go! I kill you! - Oh, stop. - Stop that. I cannot be murderous when I am being tickled. I kill you! Stop it! I've been working on my big bomb All the dead long night Dear diary, my bomb is complete. Tomorrow I will get my revenge on these people who have been so nice to me. Here's a soft pillow. How I hate them. Is it hypoallergenic? Just like you asked. Yes, thank you, evil, American, monster she-woman. You French have such colorful words for everything. Oh, are you writing a book'? Yes, it is a book of humorous observations about small-town life, like the kind by your famous instigator of suicide, Garrison Keillor. That's nice. Nighty-night now. Nighty-night, "nighty-night. Hello, gorgeous. Hey! I want to talk to you. I don't have a bomb. You're not fooling me, kid. I know why you're here. Is that so? Well... My parents brought you here just to make me look bad. La la la la. I can't compare to how cool you are. You're from France and all. I hate you. Aw, really? I hate you too. My dad thinks I should be playing football, but I don't want to do that. I'm good at other stuff- secret stuff I've never even told my parents about. You wish to lie with another boy of your gender? No! I want to be a ventriloquist. A what? You know, a ventriloquist. I have a dummy. I make it talk. We tell jokes in front of big audiences and get big laughs. That is a job? ' Yes! That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Seriously, who is going to pay to see anyone do that crap? But I'm good at it. I've been practicing with my new dummy. Da-d a-d a-d a! Little Jeff. Hiya, Claude. That toy is possessed with a human spirit! I pound your face with a shoe, which is the worst thing you can do to someone in my country for some reason that no one has ever explained to anyone. Hey, what's wrong with you? I'm sorry I said anything to you. This is gonna be a long summer. Or a short one. Aah! Whew. It's only you. I thought you were Jessica Chastain. Who's that? She was the crazy bitch in The Help. What are you doing here? I was, like, out with my boyfriend, now my ex-boyfriend. Ugh. I hate him. I wish he was dead. Hmm. Does he live within a 20-mile radius of tomorrow's parade? Please don't tell Mom and Dad. The place where my lips once were is sealed. They never liked him anyway. They think I have, like, bad taste in guys? You? No. Don't be so hard on your- Mwah. Wow. I felt something just now. Well, that was my detonator- bomb, penis, nothing! You're so funny. Gracias? And I love your French accent. Cassidy, are you home? Got to go. I'll love you till I die. Stay within the 20-mile radius. - Good night, Cassidy. - Good night, Mom. - Good night, Kevin. - Good night, Dad! Good night, Ginny! Why are you screaming at me when I'm lying right next to you? Sorry, honey! Good night, little Jeff! Good night, "ethery-diddy"! Silence! Good night, bomb. Great job, Mom. Thanks. And don't you two look nice. Yeah, I got this shirt at the- Ah! It's almost time for the show to start. Kevin, do you know where Claude is? No, Mom, I don't. "Claude. Claude. Where's Claude?" Everybody loves the French guy. He was in the car with us. He had on this great French cologne. It smelled like sawdust and fertilizer. Here we are! Almost there. Nobody help or touch me, please. Also, please turn off all cell phones. Claude, you look so patriotic. Yes, it is patriotism is given me a glow in my heart and a pain in my neck. Ow! Ginny, the town square looks great. This event will be just the thing to turn around our town spirit and get me reelected, or you're fired. Just kidding. Not really. Mayor McEwen, this is Claude, our French exchange student. Bonjour, Claude. Comment allez-vous? Uh, ou est la toilette fromage? Oh, that's cute. Whoa! What the hell? Holy crap! Pardon my French. Hey, Ginny, nice shindig. A little low-key if you ask me. I mean, where's the eagle? Nothing says kick-ass like a flag with wings that go Americaw! Americaw! - Americaw! - Americaw! Americaw! - Americaw! - Ah! Claude, these are our neighbors, the Andersons. Chet and Ev, this is Claude. Nice to meet you, Claude. You know, I usually don't like you Frenchies, but in your case, I'll make an exception. Don't be an idiot. I hate the French. Well, then we are gonna be simpatico. Ha. That's Mexican for "I wet your back, you wet mine." Such a delightful racist. I like you. Way to set an example, Chet. Carl Zimmer. We're not all tea-bagging wing nuts like him, Claude. Yeah? And we're not all freedom-hating, Al-kissing, gunless lesbians like this guy. Americaw! Please, can't you two get along? Very soon none of this will matter. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the little French boys' room. Hurry back. You don't want to miss the show. My show will leave a bigger impression. Five minutes to blow time. I should totally tweet that. Justin Bieber is going to be in Portland! And in the centennial spirit, suits at Stan McEwen's Wide and Tall are on sale for $100. Supply is limited. Suits may have been pre-worn. Now, we have a very special guest here today, uh, somewhere. Right? I don't know where he- There he is. Claude, up here. A big hand for our new friend from France, everyone. Hello. You don't know me from a hole in the ground, but get ready! Bye, now. T-T-F-U. Oh, no, you're not going anywhere, our new friend. Help! I'm being illegally detained by a large black man who is dressed very nicely. You big silly. We have something for you. Oh, good. I have something for you too. You first. America is a nation of foreigners, and you're our first legal one. And now Raul's Gardening Service would like to give you a 21-leaf-blower salute. That's why we're all here- to thank you and welcome you! Hooray! You people are all so moronically cheerful. Now, to help celebrate Claude's arrival, put your hands together for American Idol season nine Hollywood round almost semifinalist, Ronny Huntingchurch! Well, this is for you, Claude. A million years ago, when Columbus sailed the sea He hadn't planned on the place he'd land on Would still be brave and free We welcome the Irish, the Chinaman, and Jew But let me say, on behalf of the USA There's no better foreigner than you Wait. I can't be crying. I must have shrapnel in my eye. You're the quill in Jefferson's hand You're Patton at Custers last stand George Washington's teeth, the great Toby Keith You put the "heart" in heartland And we say to you with pride soon to bust We pray to our God But it's in Claude That we trust You-you trust me? What a fatwa. The guys have it all wrong. You are the best infidels ever. Where I am from, no one is nice. They stay in their caves, knee-deep in camel poop, covering their wives so they look like Pac-Man ghosts. That's French for you. I love this country. Life to America! Oh! I'll be right back. That really hurt. You'll get used to it. Where is that bomb? It's always in the last place you look. Ow! There you are. Huh? You actual, literal son of a bitch. No, no, no, no, that is not a squeaky bomb. Give me that bomb. I have to save the people I wanted to kill a minute ago. Oh. The things I have to do. Billy, look what I have for you. It's your favorite... femur. Go get it, Bill! Oh... no! Fuuuuuu- Whew! That was close. That's a pretty big button. Ooh! I bet this looks awesome from down there! He really loves America. I sure hope so. America, I love you! Still love it. Loving it a little less. I'm at Americaville General Hospital where an entire town is holding a vigil for someone they just met this morning... a brave little boy from France named Claude. Ah! La la la la! It's burning. Doctor, is he gonna be okay? Well, he displays no vital signs whatsoever. The technical term for that is "dead." - Golly, that sounds serious. - Huh? He's waking up. My boyfriend's waking up. The wire that's blue will not hurt you. The wire that's red will make us dead. Shh. I think he's trying to tell us something. The bomb on the bus goes Bing, bang, boom Bing, bang, boom Bing, bang, boom, bing, bang, bang Bada, bada-bing, bing Hey, everybody! Oh, the pain! It's making me say things only sung at terrorist camp. Well, that's the most we can expect from him right now, I'm afraid. We should leave him now. He needs his rest. Mom, I guess you'll need someone to take Claude's spot in the parade. I've been working on something. Parade? I can be in a real American parade where people wait all night to get great seats to watch other people walk? Count me in! Sorry. Hmm. I thought you were dead. It's a miracle. Aah! I declare this centennial parade started! Look what you did, Claude. You've inspired the entire town. Thank you. I don't have to blow up again, do I? Congratulations, Claude. In the words of Michelle Obama, "For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country." Yes, we heard her say that. That is when we recruited her. She is a true American. Yes, and her hair is actually straight. Son, you're the real hero, 210% American. You people suck at mathematics. I love it. Claude, Dave Chester, CNN. CNN? I love you Quys. You're the Borders Books of cable networks. Claude, you've only been here two days, and you've already been hit by a truck, gotten blown up, rolled down a hill in a fiery Dumpster... And I've tried curly fries. So how do you like our country? Well, I'm in America, so I won't tell you how I feel. I will sing, just like those 30-year-old teenagers on that bafflingly beloved TV show Glee. I love to hate-watch it. When I was merely four years old There was nothing I thought greater Than to turn this nation you call home Into a giant smoking crater But like Miley Cyrus and her bong Or Brett Favre texting all night long Or Mitt Romney's awful sing-along- Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care I was wrong, I was wrong I was wrong I was wrong, I see no drone Yes, I was wrong, Obama phone And so unconscious and half dead I wrote this song You folks are quite easily suckered But your heart's where it belongs I don't know why I can't deny that I was wrong Running water, Girls Gone Wild No bombs strapped to any child - Ah! - I find I am beguiled - Americaw! - Yeah, what he said. So much food you throw away So much TV filled with gay I love you, Project Runway, so I canceled my fatwa 'Cause I was wrong - Oh, he was wrong - Yes, I was wrong So very wrong About America, I say that I was- Wrong, wrong, wrong When I look across your faces Be they Wilson, Berg, or Chong I must admit I am a twit, and I was wrong Oh, I'll miss my friend the sniper And my flea-infested cave I'll sort of miss my second chance To have an early grave But even though you're filled with sin Like Blind Side, you all took me in A foreigner who has no skin Ah. Get away from him! He's mine! I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong Yes, you're dim and rather simple And you shouldn't wear a thong But it's clear I shall stay here For I was wrong, wrong, wrong Yes, it is clear I shall stay here Where I belong All right, you can do it just this once. Americaw! - Good night, Ginny. - Good night, Claude. - Good night, Wayne. - Good night, Claude. - Good night, Cassidy. - Good night, Claude. - Good night, Kevin. - Good night, Claude. Good night, Kevin's creepy, dead-eyed boy doll. Shut "ut"! Okay. Good night, America. Chet, you're gonna crash this thing! We're already late, thanks to you. Will you hurry up? Well, I'm sorry. My flip-flop blew out. Well, then you're gonna be left behind. I want to make sure Claude sees me cheering him on. Hey, there, Carl. Nice view, huh? It's all right. So, uh... Any room up there for- No. No, Chet, not really. I've been waiting here all morning. Look, can you help a friend out? I could help you, but then you'd come to depend on that help, like a welfare queen. God dang it. Hey, uh, boss, check it out. It has dual quad carbs like an original muscle car, but I designed it to sit on a chassis of our existing midsize, so you'd only have to make a few tweaks on the assembly line to- - Yeah, yeah, whatever. You think maybe later I could have my picture taken with the French kid? Sure, but maybe then can you look at the- I'll definitely think about it, Wayne. Can we Photoshop Claude in with the CEO, do you think? - I guess - Yeah, great, great. I got to pee. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Mayor Stan McEwen. I'm not sure what we're in store for today, but I know it will be special. It is my honor to present the chairwoman of my reelection campaign, Mrs. Ginny Wilson. Hello, everyone. I know you're waiting for the main event, so I'll just read from these prepared remarks written by our special guest. "Good afternoon, my cherished new American fiends." Friends! Friends! Sorry. Wha-it-it says "fiends" here. That is a typo and not a Freudian slip reflecting something I used to believe with every fiber of my being. Goon "I hope you will appreciate the wonderful surprise I hate for you." Have. "And I hope it will kill you." Thrill. More typos. Stupid AutoCorrect. Am I right? Maybe we should skip. Right, right. Well, clearly I'm not very good at this, so let me hand over the program to the reason we're all here today, Americaville's new favorite son, your friend and mine, Claude! Thank you! You are too kind. Okay. If I could have- Thank you. Really, this is too much. Thank you. If-Silence! I've had some time to reflect on what you wonderful people in this wonderful town in this wonderful country mean to me. And today I, Claude, from France, want to pay you back for the hospitality you have shown me, to thank not just the Wilson family. Give them a hand. There they are. Very nice. Cassidy, please, don't get hooked on me. Choose one of the many idiot boys in this town. And, Kevin, I like you. I really do. Put down that stupid dummy. You will never get girls as long as you have that thing. Anyway, I am so grateful to all of you that I have decided to present you with a gift, much as you Americans were given the Statue of Liberty by my country of France- France being the place lam from and no place else. Here it is! Hey, that's just Big Rock Rock. - Hmm. - Yes... But thanks to my talents in explosives, talents which I learned along with every other French school boy in France, the land of my birth, I present to you... Mount America Foreverberg! These are your four greatest American icons- billionaire wig model Donald Trump... professional man-hater Taylor Swift... tiny ageless weirdo Tom Cruise... and famed drug lord Lance Armstrong! I'm getting a hankering for the full-on salute. Oh. So you still do get those? Tom Cruise starred in one of my favorite films, Jerry Maguire. I got misty when Renee Zellweger dumped him. Thanks for the spoiler, jerk. I haven't watched it yet. We love you! - Way to go. - You're the best, Achmed. My American dream has come true. I believe I can safely say, with no fear of being ironically contradicted, that nothing, I mean nothing, can ruin this golden moment. Hello, Achmed. Holy crap. United States Americans, my name is Hassan al-Hassan. Hey, that there's a terrorist. Nice going, Chet. Just because he has an Arabic name, he's automatically a terrorist. I am a terrorist. Welcome to America. This person is a traitor! Achmed's name isn't Claude. Achmed's name is Achmed. It is? - And he is a terrorist. - He is? And he is a skeleton. He is? - A re r-re re-to n? - I am? Yeah, but if his name is Achmed, then where's Claude? Is what he said true? No! Well... No, no, no, I'm no terrorist. I'm a nice guy. You know, the real me, production-number me. Remember my song? Everything you know about me says I'm a great guy and a true American. Everything except this! I found this in his room. All his plans to blow us up are in here... and some weird drawings of him riding a flying horse? It was a superhero character I was working on- Turban Cowboy. It's turban time. Well, now that I hear it out loud... Come on, guys. This is America, where if you're white, you can get away with anything. And there's nobody whiter than me. I know him. In my heart, it's not true. - Crazy. - What about my reelection? I think he might be a terrorist. Please, I beg you. Listen to me. Are any of us what we really appear to be? Daddy, maybe he is a terrorist. If you would only listen. Silence! I kill you! Is what a real terrorist might say. I guess we should call the police. Not necessary. I'm a deputy. You bought that at a toy store. I didn't buy this at no toy store. I won it at a church raffle. Say your prayers, bonehead. This is FBI agent Jack Bauer. Ooh! Not the one from TV. Aw! It's my real name. It's fairly common. I get this all the time. Calm down. You have 24 seconds to surrender, starting now. Oh, no, I'm too pretty for prison. Yes, you are. Achmed, before you go, there's someone who wants to say something. You're a "dad" man! You should "de" ashamed. That toy is possessed with a human spirit! Foot bones, don't fail me now! Stop it, Chet. You're gonna hurt somebody. Freedom ain't free, Ev. Not so fast! I've got a Mexican, and I'm not afraid to use it. I am not an "it." My name is Carlos. This is not about you. Anybody makes a move, and I blow him. With the leaf blower. I can't believe you all went there. I am so disappointed. Ah, screw it. Good-bye, Americaville. Hello, traitor. Hassan! It's day five of "America Made to Look Stupid." The little town of Americaville deals with the revelation that they've been harboring the known terrorist Achmed who lived among them in disguise. Reaction to this story has come from across the political spectrum, with Democrats and Republicans finally finding common ground on something. Americaville, now known as Terrorist Town, USA, is the worst city in the entire United States. It's a town of pinheads, and the biggest pinheads of all are the family that harbored the terrorist. And they're the subject of my new book, Killing the Wilsons. America is a country of laws and due process, but in the Wilsons' case, a drone strike is too good for them. Are we even sure that Mr. Wilson is the father of this terrorist? Hmm? Automaker U.S. Motors, where terrorist harborer Wayne Wilson once worked, announced today that, as a gesture of apology, they will close their Americaville plant, demolish it, burn the ruins, lock the ashes in a concrete vault, and bury the vault under Giants Stadium. Would you mind if we turned that off? Sorry. We're under orders to make you watch it and keep TiVo-ing back to the beginning. And they're the subject of my new book, Killing the Wilsons. So that's your testimony. You had no idea this fella was a terrorist or a skeleton? No, we just liked him. Okay, we're done here. Thank you. Maybe we can go back to some version of our lives and- No, ma'am, you don't understand. I said we're done here. This is not the America I grew up in. I advise you to be quiet. Anything you say may be used against you at trial. Oh, there won't be a trial. Uh, no worries, then. Here we go. My friends, today your new life begins, for just on the other side of this tunnel is America and your new Home... Depot parking lot. ' Yes! Oh, we are finally out of that wretched place and away from those horrible people. But you guys have fun. Knock yourselves out. I can't believe the Wilsons just gave me up after all we meant to each other. I broke bread with them. I put a bomb in their guest room. How could you let yourself be brainwashed by those infidels, after we spent so much time brainwashing you to hate them? I guess I am just washable. Soon this will all be over, and the decadent nation will only be a bitter memory. Two tickets for the Third World, please, first-class. May the Wilsons rot in hell! I am glad I will never see them again. Wait. What's this? There we see the escaped terrorist's accomplices being led away to prison. Terrorist lovers, go home! Go back to another country! They were not my accomplices. I was the mastermind of this fiasco. If I could just say one thing... Claude, Achmed, wherever you are, - if you can hear me... - I can! We know you're really a nice boy, and we hope you're okay. What? The Wilsons are put onto the prison bus and... goooooooooal! I can't let the Wilsons become the first innocent people ever wrongly imprisoned in America. Hassan, you must take me back there to help them. You are insane. I wouldn't pay more attention to the shrieks of a rabid water buffalo. Oh, yes, how is your wife? Zing, boom! American put-down humor. For that, I should kill until you are dead. But she is fine. She's lost some weight. She's more cow than water buffalo. Anyway, come to your senses! Why do you want to go back to that devil-filled country? All right, I will tell you. I want you to imagine a place where all are equal and all are welcome, no matter where you came from or who your father was or how much land you own. It's a place dedicated to the pursuit of happiness, where all the good things in life are spread before you. And it is your right to take as much as your heart desires. This place, my friend, is called HomeBound Buffet. And America is filled with them. Loom These people- they all seem so happy. That's what unlimited buffet does for a nation. Unlimited? Surely there must be some limits. Nope. All right, they serve dinner, yes, but surely not desert. Bottomless frozen-yogurt bar with all kinds of toppings- Oreo, Snickers, Cap'n Crunch. Don't say Butterfingers. Don't say Butterfingers. Butterfingers. I must go there at once. Let me in! I must go to... Route 75, America, at the West Town Country Mall at once. No! We have to save the Wilsons first. - Just a little fro-yo? - Okay. One standard serving of fro-yo, no more than two toppings. Ooh, yay! Let us in! Hey, you. Get away from there. Holy crap. It's the po-po. That's the funny name they have for police in America. I love it. I said get out of here. No entry! But we have to save our friends. The FBI thinks they are terrorists, but they're not. We are... is what a bad person would say in the scene from our new Broadway musical, Les Mis Arabs. Uh, got to go! Terrorists! After 'em! Achmed, I am so sorry. What do we do now? We do what Americans do. - Eat? - No. What Americans do when they run out of options. Throw a Hail Mary pass? Close. They pray. But we pray all the time, like, 38 times a day. No, no, we have to pray like Americans. How is that? They ask for things like sports victories, no pregnancy, and celebrity side boob. What do we pray for- side boob? No. A miracle. Aah! Side boob. Aah! Aah! It's American. Yes, bald eagle, mighty American symbol, who is the second-place choice after a turkey, take us into America. It's turban time! We have live team coverage of the bus convoy as it slowly makes its way down the main street of Americaville and on to Guantanamo. Let's go now live to our Madison Ashford, who's embedded with the terrorist family and their captors. Dave, I'm here with the terrorist sympathizers. We simply gave him a home. Confessed terrorist sympathizers as they head to their well-earned imprisonment. There's no place like home. Another barrage of eggs has hit the bus. That's why I'm in body armor. There's my Girl Scout leader and my civics teacher. Well, who threw all those? Father O'Malley and Rabbi Weisman are holding a slingshot for Imam Abdullah. Well, at least we helped bring some people together. Wilsons, if there's a hell, you're going to it. Hey, when this is over, you guys want to walk into a bar? Oh. Oh! Oh! I am so full. I think America is going to mean death to me. Funny. That could be the title of your memoir. That's a little too on the nose for me. I will ask the Wilsons what they think about it. The Wilsons! We've got to save them. Hassan, we must leave now, but stealthfully to avoid detection. How was your meal, gentlemen? Oh, it was perfect, so delicious. But we have to go now. We're bringing out a new trough of Butterfinger pieces. How very fattening of you. Thanks. - Are they freshly crumbled? - You bet ya. Much as we'd like to gorge ourselves into an early grave, we really have to go... now! Charlie Sheen. - Bush. - Is something wrong? Oh, no, it's all hunky-dory. What could be wrong? We've had our ridiculously huge dinner, burped and farted to our heart's content, and now we're leaving, just like any other Americans- I look so young in that picture. Holy crap. Well, it looks like you've got us. Oh, look, they're putting out more pizza bread. - Ooh! - Go! Go, go, go, go! More sprinkles, please. Oh, and some fresh bread. Wow. This country throws out so many cars. It's fantastic! I know, right? This is not good. The Wilsons need me, and I've let them down. The least I can do, in case we don't make it, is write a note that clears them. Can it be? Hassan, how are you at building things? Not as good as blowing things up. That's going to have to change. Grab that welding crap and come with me. - What are we building? - You'll see! These are hurting my wrists. Sorry, ma'am. I'm under orders. All right. You can do that? It's highly classified. So are you. I'm not sure you know what that word means, but thank you. Ooh, Chris Matthews is going to get moist over this. Honey, ain't this the best anniversary present, seeing our neighbors go to prison? Jewelry's nice. Hey, what song should I play now? How about America, Eff Yeah, from that Team America movie? That song is ironic, Chet. It ain't ironic if you don't get the joke. " Ow! That better be cage-free. Bite my justice, you arugula-eating left turd! Now, I know things look bad, but we can't just give up. We have to maintain hope that something or someone can save us. That's right, kids. We have to hope for something better because that's what we do. I don't know who will help us. It could be a stranger. It could be someone who hasn't been born yet. It could be- Flaming skull! Is that a superhero? No, it's a flaming skull! Loom Greetings, infidels! It's Claude. My name is Achmed! Girl car! Wiener substitute! Ah, hell, no. Leave him alone, Chet! You're what's wrong with America! No! You're what's wrong with America! Americaw! Gentlemen, you are both correct! Hey, what the- Get out of my way! I hate you, Chet! - Damn- - I've always hated you! Turd car! HEY- Oh. Sorry. No worries. We've got Obamacare. Hello, Wilsons! I love you! Whoa! Even you, you little backstabber! Thanks, Achmed. I still say he's a bad man! Someone has been practicing! Thanks! Great Hoover's pantyhose. What the hell? I am turning myself in. He's turning himself into a bomb. I think he said, "Turning myself in." When did you graduate from Quantico? Prepare to fire. How is it going? Been better, been worse. Don't shoot! Please, hear him out. Ladies and gentlemen and big dangerous guns, I came back to tell you that these wonderful people, the Wilsons, do not deserve to be taken to prison. I do. Wait, wait, wait. Why did we all just gasp? We know he should go to prison. I don't know. I feel kind of stupid about that now. It's true that I came here with the intent of doing you harm, but that is all over. And the Wilsons had nothing to do with it because they are decent, kind people, like Americans everywhere. Let me know when you got the shot. Roger that. The Wilsons' only crime was seeing the best in me, and my only crime was not seeing the best in them... and plotting to blow up the whole town, yada, yada. If I may say a word or two. Of course, sir. Where's my kill shot, people? I don't see him. Oh, wait. That's better. We're clear. Subject is in the target zone. On my command, in three... I'd like to say a few words about this remarkable young man. Hey, whoever is playing with that laser pen out there should really stop. You could detach a retina. They're going to shoot him. ..Two, one, f- Sniper team, stand down! What- Who is that? I said stand down! That is a direct order! This is General Charles McCarthy of the United States Joint Command, and I order you to stand down now! That's better. - It's a miracle. - Kind of. Now toss your weapons in that drainage ditch. And let Mr. Wilson speak. Thank you, General McCarthy. And thank you, son. Why ain't they shooting him? He's right there. He's surrendering peacefully. Not in my America. Now, dear, this ain't right. Why can't you be more supportive of my hobbies? That is not good. I can see my cave from here. Au revoir, you towel-headed French fry. - Now, Chet! - Don't "now, Chet" me. He got what he deserved. You do good things, and you'll be rewarded. You do bad things, and it's hasta la bye-bye. Hiya, Chet. Save me, Sean Hannity! No! My fuel-efficient hybrid! My lower torso. Anyway, you were saying. - How can you still be alive? - I think I know. Because the American dream burns within him. Actually, that's a piece of shrapnel. But I feel you. This amazing young man, this skeleton- Yes, I admit now he is just a talking skeleton. - No offense. - Please. We're past that. He stays alive because he believes in the America we all believe in, a place where you can make a fresh start no matter where you came from, where you can arrive in this country without a dollar in your pocket, change your name, and make a new life. It happened to someone you might have heard of, someone named Miss Shania Twain. - She's not American? - Canadian. No. Who's Shania Twain? I love Shania Twain. You do? So, to quote one of Shania Twain's biggest hits- Man! I Feel Like a Woman!? No. Let's find a new spirit of cooperation and forgiveness. That Don't Impress Me Much? Not that one either. I'm getting there. Let's put our hearts together and- Well, those were two of her biggest hits according to Billboard's country-western charts- Silence! You were saying? Let's make a new Americaville and a new America from this moment on! Aw! Okay, that was big too. Come here. I guess there's nobody for me to hug. Is this your stupid little annoying dog? - Billy! - Billy? I do not know who you're talking to. My name is Claude. No, silly, the dog's name is Bill. You Americans give your dogs people names? You are as dimwitted as you are boring. I think I just got shot with an arrow. Uh, you can all go home. Sorry about that. That's okay. And Achmed is free to go too, right? Uh... No, I am a criminal after all. I do not think there is a Shania Twain song to help me escape paying my debt to society. No One Needs to Know is appropriate. Loom How do you like that? It's the President! Of the United States? Yes, the United States Motor Company! Uh, Mr. Ach-med, I've just spoken to the Attorney General, and based on my offer to personally vouch for your renunciation of terrorism and the fact that you never accomplished anything destructive... It's true. He blows. ...our government is prepared to grant you a full, complete, and unconditional pardon. Yay! - On one condition. - Boo! That you share with me the plans for that amazing car that you just drove here today. My car? Yes, you've done the seemingly impossible. You've created an American-made automobile in America that Americans actually want to buy. It is a bad-ass ride. - It's a deal. - Yay! On one condition. Boo! No, no, it's a good condition. - Yay! - Yay? The condition is you give credit to the man who actually designed this car, Wayne Wilson. I thought that looked familiar. It should. Hassan and I built it based on your drawing. The flaming skull was me. Hey, everyone, Carl and I are opening a bed-and-breakfast. Sorry, Ev. Well, I wondered when you were gonna finally figure yourself out. Go be happy. Just leave me and Stan the beach house in Roanoke. - Stan? - Good-bye! I was a terrible mayor. This is the country you want to live in? There is not a better one. Then maybe you can be a reference for my job application? Former terrorist log, love date 8/3/13. I am now a citizen of Americaville. It's a good life. Wayne and Ginny have found their true calling. The kids are having fun. I've found a job where I can use my skills and make people happy. And once a week, we all get together for a bountiful feast. Yes, all in all, it's been one incredible year, and the next one will be even better. - Good night, Wayne. - Good night, Achmed. - Good night, Ginny. - Good night, Achmed. Good night, Cassidy. Good night, Kevin. Good night, little Jeff. - Good night. - Good night! Good night, dog with the dynamite in his mouth. Uh-oh. Good boy.
