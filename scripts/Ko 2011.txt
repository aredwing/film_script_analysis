What have you published on the paper?! Sure there will be few rats when we kept rice bag. Don't have culprits in the press? Someone got emotional and struck the guy.

You thought what she said is true?! To how many ppl she have said that?! I never sees her like that. I even told my mom about you. But I don't have any feeling like that towards you. You're lying. I have seen it on your eyes. No such thing on my heart. Why are you crying if you don't love me?! You're talking as your wish! Am I insane?! You are my lovable insane. And my dearest devil. It will be vulgar if I say I'm in love with you! But you can tell her! - Please try to understand me. It's ok if you tell that you don't love me. But you told that I fall in love with everyone. Listen to me. You achieve everything by being silent! What are you looking at?! I won't ask permission for all this! I am like that! Insane and devil. Keep him! Why are you keep on acting?! Are you married?! Can't even handle one back home! Please let me go! I'm not marry yet. I will wait for you. Come inside. You can talk with Saro later. Then you give me one. Then it's ok. One shaman told him if he marries a young girl he will win the seat. My parents torture me back at home. My father is scolding me that he spend so much for my education. But I'm not going to the clinic but going for talks. Is he Alavandhan or useless?! Give soda! Give way. Don't give him soda! What are you doing here?! Go away! Don't you worry. You'll be fine. Thanks a lot. Sorry to be harsh. -You bring him to hospital immediately. I feel so cold. - And I have problem in my eyes. What is the data saying about upcoming elections? The opponent party is not close to you. But these youngsters.. All the data gathered by the youngsters, so they're siding their side. We thought they will only cover colleges and centres. But they have seriously get down in the city and villages. Nothing much to worry about. So you say we need to be worry? Dear ppl who doesn't ask for free food. And dear ppl who don't need alcohol for this meeting. We are so proud to see all of you here. We pray that we will get bald if Ajith wins in the race. Will our cricket team win or not? And want to know how many cameras are fixed in ashrams. Even everyone are laughing. So we will get all the information well for all that. But ppl don't really care who will we vote for and who is the nominee. In our team we have 8 ppl that have PhD. The person that standing there like a 'laddu', Syed. He is so smart. Why am I telling all this to you is most of government sponsored, Students will leave India once they finishes their studies. Sure he didn't get visa to go. That's why he's talking like this. You can see most of the post in Nasa and Google hold by the Indians. We can't blame them. Vasanthan is so cute right? -You have started? The person I have eyed on, you took him from me. Won't you let me to see others too?! Just send us two person who are doing wrong. We will make them suffer. Greeting to friends. They keep on lying about there will dam, hotels. They stole land of the poor and chase them off. That's why now they arose with weapons. You know well how bad is politic. Vasanthan will give speech next. Greetings to all. Normally, youngsters doesn't like to be involved in politics. Because we can't think by ourselves. Won't have respects. Ppl who are coming in politics saying they will be clean. Ended up washing their legs in swamp. Now they will talk beautifully. Once they have the post, they will show their true color. Don't we need a change? You even let go your freedom to talk?! Don't we need a change?! -We want! We are new in this. No experience. And we don't have money to give. But we don't scared of anything. I believe we can change the faith! Give way. -Yours is late news, and mine is live. What?! - Is this live too?! Don't make noise and tell everyone! Just go ahead. We are ready to stand for hours to buy ticket for a movie. And stand at American embassy as early as 3am. But, do we need to stand and wait to vote? How many never votes? We can forgive ppl who vote after getting bribe, or vote for a different party. But won't forgive the person who just sit at home watching TV.. And don't come to vote! What do you say?! It is our responsible to vote. Don't you forget that. Go from here! Get down from the stage! -What have happened Ashwin? There is a bomb under the stage. How you got to know there is a bomb?! Where were you all this while? - I was here. It's burning! - Go and see that kid! Are you fine? - I'm fine. What happened to our friends? I have medical thing in my car. I'll bring it. My leg. Did you see Saro?! She's the one who sent me the text saying got bomb under the stage. You try to call her. Look at me Saro! How you got to know there is a bomb? See whether parents has arrived? -Why are you sending like this? The body blasted into pieces. So can't get the full of it. Is there any chances that election will bring forward? You make move first. What all this?! Is it a hospital or meat shop? All of them are educated and paying their tax. Don't you know where to keep them? All the beds are full. No beds in the hospital. But all the money is In their pockets. The whole country is the same. -What? Our Raji, lost his leg. You should stand in one place. All gone because you keep on hoping here and there. He's our man. Take care of him well. What is she doing here? How can she still alive? You still alive? They said Dina Anjali's girl passed away? And I mistakenly thought it was you. Please forgive me. Be well dear. So the one died is the English speaking girl? I spend all my money to make him a doctor. You brain washed him and giving him back as a corpse! This is not as easy as you study, get marks and join the work. Politics is a dangerous place to be. You are just a small kid. This is the starting. They will hit you some more. You have to face it. They will chase you off. You have to bear it. Think and do. Be ready for everything. Who might fixed the bomb? Everyone know about this. Now is the election time, how can I say it. What you can't tell openly? Did he come to visit? -Who? All the truth will come out once we win the election. How many of your ppl died? And how many women have died? Go away! -Why are you chasing us out?! We are here for your party's problem right! No more party! We're pulling back! Are you going to do something on this election? We won't stand for the election. All of us just a normal ppl. Why must they fixed a bomb? What wrong all these ppl did?! What's the answer for this cries?! We don't want politics anymore! Go away! Don't disturb them anymore! Off the light. He's in bad condition. He will come on right time to arbitrate. Why is he shouting?! I don't need your press help. Listen to me Vasanth. What's happening here? A bomb exploded in public on election time! What were you doing? This is how you gave security!? At that time we had 4 meeting which involved our ministers. We have to send our ppl there. - Always have excuses to tell! Have seen the reports right?! IED bomb have explode. They have used syntax. See if they have problems among them. It's not just nodding your head! Get few suspect and show it in channels! Tomorrow the news must be different. What? Am I serving food here?! Go! Pour it on my head! How is he making a scene! They will put the bomb, and we have to catch someone. What a life! Saro's parents? This is the video taken before the cameraman Punithan's death. Many ppl have died while running to escape. It is said that many died because stepped by crowds then the blast. Police department are doing investigation about this blast. Let's go back Ashwin. You go back home. I have work to do. Even he died, his camera recording went on for 1 5 minutes more. We have edited everything before view it to public. Take off the Malar's logo. Rotate the image. What is in this? Zoom on the top left. He's stepping her. This is Saro's phone. Copy this on a CD for me. Who?! What happened? Up there. Someone there. I'm scared. Come we go and see, what is there. The one who came in didn't take any valuable things. He came for the bag. You didn't touch anything right. The one who killed Saro have used her phone. It is in the video footage itself. Send it for finger print check. Please call me if anything else. I will be back tomorrow morning. If anything just call me. Why never tell me about this?! Why did they kill her?! What wrong she did?! Will they do anything for post?! I'm scared. Don't leave me alone. Look here. I won't go anywhere. There is a mystery behind Dina Anjali Saro's death. It is said that there is a big plot behind her murder. She was murdered after she recognized the person who fix the bomb. It is suspected that one of the party have involved in this matter. It have been a talk among ppl that.. will the murder be brought to the justice? Everyone will suffer in this election. How are you? - I'm fine now. Am I early? -They are our media. The rest of other press have boycotted us. Our leader is brave and bold. That is why he keep actress Sumitha Kothari with him. Forgive me. He is nominating her for a seat on his own district. And she's ready to open anything for the party. I am here talking to you is because.. Our chemistry is good. You do know about me. I have a big heart. All of you are in there. I'm standing here because all of you will vote me. Why is she talking like this? Yes that it is. Please everyone vote me. I'm late for my night shooting. Saw the crowd? Next I'm calling our leader for his speech. We should ask Sumitha to give speech at the end. You should told this earlier! This is the report released now. Ppl didn't ignore you even you ignore them. Look how much did you team got on opinion poll. From 10% to 36% now. Don't let them win. Only your ppl died on the blast! The rest died too. Even our Saro died too! Did we throw all our cameras and pen and sit in one corner?! You're scared! You scared they will kill you! Is he a leader?! What if he doesn't stand?! We will stand! We still believe in you. Who are the 30 died ppl for us?! They have trusted on us. So it will be meaningless for their sacrifice. Truth must win. His goal was to vanish bribe. But even to take his corpse, we have to give bribe. His goal was to vanish bribe. But even to take his corpse, we have to give bribe. When we asked why, they said it is life. They're asking why you need to care about others. And just take care of your family. And be home. We have decided. We will be selfish. We are going to live for our family. But our family is big. So big! How many bomb will you blast?! We will fall and arise like seeds. Most of the place Yogi's party is winning. Alavandhan have lost to Kiran Kumar. They have changed the wiring as all the buttons will marks as theirs. Yogi have won in different of 50,000 votes. Move. The new party is winning around 1 00 places. These are the nominees. Have won. Vasanthan is losing 200 votes behind Yogi's party. We won?! Should I blast it? Is it so important?! Last counting between Meyappan and Vasanthan, Vasanthan have won. Our leader should won it. They cheated inside. Careful. How can you change in a second?! On taking post as the chief minister. I'm Vasanthan Perumal.. Only now the game will start. You will feel the heat of the chair. You can give thousands of promises. But you can't change anything. Thanks. Came here to bless us. This is a history. He have brake all the records. We need Vasanthan's photos. Mainly crowd cheering him up. Where is my pendrive? In my drawer. I'm the Dina Anjali's photographer. Did you get any finger prints on her phone? Yes, we got three prints. One is hers. We are still checking the rest. The ppl who rob the bank earlier. Can you check if there is any match you got from the bank? I will check and inform you. Come here. Try to compare these three pictures. It is taken at bank robbery. He have scars on top of his eye. The same person who rob and at the assembly. He must be the one who put the bomb. Look at his sling bag. Look at the video footage when Saro was killed. The same clothes and sling bag. Three pictures are the same person. I also got an important evidence. What is the meaning of this?! You have hide the truth that both of you are friends from college. Why? Can we discuss about this later?! I want to know about it now! What is the relationship between him and you? We don't have any relationship. We are standing in 1 0 places in coming elections. Take the application forms. What happened to IAT guys who stand for elections? They didn't even get 100 votes. They lost terribly. Who will change this country if youngsters like us walk away?! There are heroes for that. It's not meant for us. We have done so many things for fun. Why don't you take leave for I will help from press side. Now I know why you got so excited. You won't understand all this now. You will know it when it happens. Surely the editor have sent me for spiritual coverage, If he gets to know I'm with Vasanthan. And wouldn't have send me to do coverage for election. That is why I never tell anyone. -You could tell me right? How could I tell you? Won't it be like I'm marking my own question paper? But I kept my attics as a press. CM and Alavandhan go down because of their own actions. Opponent party washed out. Vasanthan went up by their mistakes. He didn't went up by himself. You made him. Now I know, you didn't risk for me on Alavandhan's issues. A bit for you, a bit for him, and a bit for our company. Watch the news. We can't settle things blood by blood. So we are releasing Naxle group from the jail. For good deeds. When will you release them? They were the one who fixed the bomb. But now he's releasing them. Coming from press. Need to see CM. I need to see CM urgently. I'm photographer from Dina Anjali. Everyone is in urgent. Collectors meeting has been delayed for an hour. Please wait for a while. Where is the conference? - It's at 2nd floor. One of the hand print that we got from the bank have on Saro's phone. We couldn't get the third one yet. But we will get it soon. I'm done. He didn't listen to me. He's my friend. Come Ashwin. I have an important thing. I have an evidence on bank robbery.. How come he is here?! He's the one killed Saro! You helped me in a way. So do he. Why are you talking insane? Wait! Listen to me. - Look at this. Look at these photos. See his marks on his face. He's the one fixed the bomb to kill you! He's the one who killed Saro. Even his finger print found on Saro's phone. I have very important meetings. We will discuss this later. He have left! Inform the police and arrest him! We will discuss this after the meeting.

Why are you left him alive? - Back stabber! Just to save yourself. You back stab us! You are suffering in pain even for a bullet. How many trains that you have sabotaged?! How many ppl you have burnt? How could you have heart to kill ppl? If you want to know about us, you should be separated from communities. As politicians have dialogues like bribe, hunger strike and such. So do ppl like you. For all of you, cinema, cricket is for chill out. You don't really know about hunger. You won't understand our objectives. But you made Vasanthan to understand better. How did you and Vasanthan got to know? You think I will reveal everything if you help me. You are a press! You will even get news from a corpse. I have seen you with him. In college. All of you did strike wearing girls dress. Even the coconut fell. Our organization is the one sponsored his studies. Traitor! This is how you drag students like Vasanthan? We have also ppl among police and courts too. Even we have ppl in your office. You're not back yet? I have work. We prepare him well. Because we need someone from our side in politics. He did give us many ideas. For election. So the house got burnt? He get whacked? He did get whacked. He bear everything to get to the top. So the one fix the bomb? I did the work. But the plan was his. Only then ppl start to support him. If I got the text late? If I went up to stage a bit late? What if the bomb blast first?! How could it blast? The trigger was in his hand. How did Saro know about the bomb? How did she sent the text? Who? The short girl? Look there. I just saw a guy. What should we do? When I start my speech. Send this text to Ashwin. We thought she's dead. But came back alive. She fell down when the crowd was in chaos. I killed her to avoid the truth come out. I killed her to avoid the truth come out. Why did you put back her phone?! It have our finger prints! If the phone reach to police hands? - I send my guys to get the phone. You messed the things. Why no black cats following you?! CM asked to use Collectors car. CM asked to use Collectors car. A press photographer is inside too. Did the terrorist talk to you? - No, they don't demands anything yet. I need to talk to them immediately. Please check if any line available. Who else is on your side in his party? The rest is innocents like you. He didn't took in anyone else. Only both of us know about it. CM here. Tell your demands. Come. You're showing your true colour to me?! You come in first! - Ok, I will come in. But you must let everyone go! Don't act! Come in. An important news about Vasanthan. We need to change the front page! It's even can change the ruling party. I will be at office in an hour. You prepare for the front page. You shouldn't go in. Stop getting good name from ppl in power! Please don't play with public life! Don't shoot anyone without my order. Close all the windows. You're sending police to kill me?! Wait! Let me come back to our discussion in a while. Wait! Let me come back to our discussion in a while. Let me get whacked from him first. What Saro did? But you killed her! He got all the news from you? Why?! -Why keep on talking about the past?! What do you want? Want to start a channel? Want to run a newspaper company? I will support you in every way. Or you want a Ministry? I will make you as Minister of Information by tomorrow. You can stand at the place which minister had died. You are a beast who is sitting above 30 dead ppl! You are a beast who is sitting above 30 dead ppl! That's the sacrifices they did. You kill them and acted as you shared their sadness.. And won't stand for the election. What can I do if you got cheated? Let me be a traitor. But our friends in our party have dreams to make this nation to be better! And you want to destroy it?! Can they have a better ruling party like us?! Do you want to destroy everything by using your press?! Stop! -What is your problem? You want to shoot me? Then? How will you go out? No one can get away from all the police. What will you do? Do you want me to tell you the way?! Point the gun to my head. Drag me out. All the police will make way for you. How much money, how many car you want? You will get as you want. Just let me go after you cross the district. You just go away with your ppl. But if he's still alive. Our live is in stake. Do you get me? Kill him first. No time to think. No time to think. I only get 10 minutes. Then the whole Commandos will come in. I can trust him. Not you. He have done something to him. He's not our Kathir. If you shoot. They will too. Finish him without using gun. Don't! Why you changed like this? It's too not late. You can join me. Why are you giving me so much of pressure? I thought of not to do this with my hand. But you give me no choice. But you give me no choice. Shoot me! Shoot me now! Don't lift your leg. It will blast. If you move I will lift my leg. Wait!

He bought you too? You're asking me to let him go after so many ppl he murdered! You're asking me to let him go after so many ppl he murdered! Just because of his death. So you want to withheld the truth! Try to understand.The rest of the party members didn't do wrong. Only Vasanthan is the culprit. No one else know about this. If this come out. The ruling party will collapse. The public who believed in truth will feel cheated. After that not even one youngster can ask for vote. After that not even one youngster can ask for vote. All the dreams and goals will vanish. This news shouldn't come out. Think. No one should know about this! It is not wrong. They have murdered CM. They have murdered CM. How did you get this news? Vasanthan have sacrificed his life to save the public. I can't have this guts. I can't have this guts. We don't have better reasons on why don't youngsters rule this government. May the brave warrior's soul rest in peace. We have hide the truth from you. We have against press attics. We're resigning. I have been truthful for 25 years. All read it and throw it. But your lies have changed the history and did the right thing. Do the coverage about who will be the next CM. Only one let down. The whole country should celebrate you. But have to keep it secretly among us. What are you doing in his room without finishing the task I gave you?! Should dismissed you from work. You won't success in your life! - I know that, As. Mr. Spiritual called you. He need you to cover story at a temple. Saro did told you not to water the cactus too much. You were at the spot when the bomb blast. Can't you get at least one shot of picture!? I don't know why are you coming for work! Next bomb blast, I will take perfectly with flash. My bad luck working as your photo editor.
