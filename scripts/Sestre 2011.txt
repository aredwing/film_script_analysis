We're here to help you. We're from the special branch and know how to protect girls like you. The inspectors need your details. The doctors just told us your state of health, but not your surname. I'll take you to an undercover place with only women. The safe house, where we'll give you psychological, legal and health aid. This is Maja and this is Olga. You can ask her for anything you need. Welcome. This is the sitting room. These are Tanja and Nidia. - Hi. This will be your bedroom. No one knows where you are, not even the police. Relax. I don't know what you are talking about. I'll be staying here tonight. If you want to talk, I'm here for you. Marija... Little one! Puss, puss, puss... Where are you, little one? Wait! Marija, are you all right? Come on, come here. Come on, get up, slowly... I finished a cosmetic course after secondary school and started working, and I wanted to go to university. Marija, how many of you were there at that audition? I don't know. There were three girls as well as us. Us? You can tell us, sweetie, don't be frightened. My sister was there. Please, don't tell anyone, I beg you. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone. You don't know what it was like there. Where? - In Florence. In Italy? You were in Italy? When were you in Italy? I was... We really were in Italy. Marija, how did you get to Italy? - We really were in Italy. The doctor says you'd have lost more blood so far from Belgrade. We really were in Italy. - I think she's said enough. What sort of discotheque is it where they play so girls can dance? It's seasonal work, Grandpa. We create an atmosphere. You'll create an atmosphere? I'll give you atmosphere! Leave them alone. Surely I have some say in this house. If it was a serious agency, you'd have some sort of contract I haven't got one in my boutique. - Then look for another job. It's not like when you were young. I can't just get any job I like. But Grandpa, look, we've got a contract! Now they don't need visas, let them travel. Krusevac isn't the world. What's this language here? - Romanian. Why? -There are no more copies in Serbian. Romania's in the European Union. - We're going to Italy. Florence. You don't say? Romania in the EU? Since when? This is a guarantee for a boiler. Please, Grandpa, let us go! This is totally worthless. - Grandpa, please! Take it easy. Nothing will come of it. I'm off. That's enough. Give me those passports. -Keep off! Mummy. -What do you mean, Mummy? -Please! As soon as he starts snoring, I'll take the passports. Can I put this in your suitcase? - It's old! No, I can still wear it. Don't be silly. We'll buy something with our first wages in Italy. We're not going there to throw our money away. I'm only packing what I really need. Can I put this in your case? - Don't take that, please. Marija, don't laugh at me. - Don't take that, please. Mummy, what are we going to do with Grandpa? Bravo! -Thank you, Mummy! - What did I tell you? If Daddy was alive, he'd be happy. You have to stand on your own feet. You'll learn Italian, won't you? You'll learn it well. You're worth the number of languages you can speak. Mummy's little treasures, Mummy's pretty little girls... Can I help you? - Thank you. Good morning! Thanks. Quickly, Grandpa's going to wake up. -Bye-bye! You know how much I'd care about that! Mummy, please, tell him we'll be back in a month. All right. Give Mummy a kiss. - Bye, Mummy. Bye! Have a good trip! "It wasn't the monotony that got to me last night. It was my heart being broken into tiny pieces." The filthy swine! Facebook is really incredible! Just for fun I've joined a group Those of us who have never traveled... And then this job came up. You weren't at the audition? - Audition? I met a cool guy. His mate has a club where I'll dance. What about you? - I won't dance. I'll look after some kids in Paris. At least you haven't got a kid. - So you've got a kid? I left him with my mother-in-law in Banja Luka. When I said I'd send them cash, they gave me a real good send-off. What's your kid called? - Lazar. -Laza... We'll stop here for a break. Let's have your passports. Come on, wake up! You two, wait in the van. You're going with two others to Paris. You stay here, another van will take you to Italy. Bye, girls. -Bye! - Come on, girls! Thanks, I could do with a rest. I'm dying for a coffee. - Me too. Here? - Yes. Are we going to Florence? - Yes, we're just taking a break. Come on, Saska, come on! Marija, come on, let's go to supper. I can't. What's up? Are you all right? - Out of my way. Marija! - Out of my way! -Katarina! Give me something, please! I can't give you anything. I'm a psychologist. -Get out! Come on, let's go to the doctor. - No, get out! Sit here. What's this? Is it possible to get a coffee in this Italy? Well then, let's keep warm while we're waiting. And now... You've no idea... Are we really not going to get a coffee here? I'll see what's up. Tanja, give the girls some coffee. Let's introduce ourselves. I'm your guide for the trip. I'm Ljubica. - I'm Tadija. Marija, pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. Saska. -I'm Tadija. Sit down. -Thank you. Pleased to meet you, girls. I'm glad you're well. I'm going to find you work in Italy. Seasonal work. Paid for in cash, except you enter as tourists. All right? You pay a higher percentage. But if we legalize everything, your stay, before you cross the border, you can do any work you like in Italy. You can get a permanent job through the union. The pay's brill. The only thing you can't do is to vote. We're free to do any work at all? - Yes, if we get seggiorno. Is it legal? -A brill question. Take it easy. Thank you, Tanja. We have experienced people in the embassies. And good connections. The contracts get you work permits. And then you give us a little cash. How much cash? - Let's say three thousand euros. Three thousand euros? How? We haven't got that sort of... Not yet, but you'll earn it eventually, isn't that so? What about the work permits? Are they real ones? Permanent? Of course. In ten years you'll be citizens and be able to vote. I mean, why not? Okay. You'll have to stay here a bit and wait for the work permits. And work a little for us. It's no small thing we're doing for you, isn't that so? You can see this is a smart place, clean, just right to find your form! Shall we first phone Mummy? Not now, it would spoil everything, and Grandpa would have a stroke. Let's just call to say we're over the border and everything's brill. That's it. Look, everything's brill here. Your rooms are upstairs. In the evening you'll dance for the customers. Do you have mobiles? Yes, we have. - Let's see. What's this? Nobody uses these any more. They're out of date. What century is this from? I don't know how it works. We'll change it. You'll get Blackberries, so we're all the same. Saja, please, change the girls telephones. Can we send an SMS to Mummy? -Saska, please! Don't worry, from now on, we're taking care of you. Come on now, cheers! Drinks on the house! Cheers! It's strong, gently. Here's your mint tea. Olga will give you your pills in the morning and evening. Thank you. Were you on drugs earlier or did they start you on them? They gave us all sorts of things so we could keep on working. Will we be able to see Jelica and Marko tomorrow? First bring my sister to me. You know where she is. I want to help you. But how? We should all have a talk together. Understand? Come on, girls... Look at all these undies. Choose what you fancy and try it on. Come on! This are horrible undies. Let's not make problems already. Strip off and see how they suit you. You take this black one. It's special, lace. Out of the question. - My sister's only just 18. She can take the pink one, if she's 18. What's the matter now? Look, I've already invested money in you. Money! No fucking around. The customers are nearly here. Come on, we'll survive. Well, can you at least turn round? Saja, we can at least turn round. The girls are shy. There, we've all turned round! Change! When someone comes in, you sit by him. He talks, you just nod. Laugh and talk. He should drink as much as possible. To leave as much money as possible. Give the money to Saja. He writes it in his notebook so nobody can steal any of it. It's your money, and the club takes care of it. The club takes a percentage since I've paid for you. And if a client wants a private dance, take him upstairs. I'll show you, and dance a private dance for him. -Private? Private! No sweat, I'll look after you. I want to go home! - Where are you off to? I've paid everything for you and the money's gone. What do you want? To lose our documents? And get arrested? You don't want to get under my skin. Please, sort this out. Just calm down, Saska. It's your turn. I'm going home. -You'll go where I tell you. Go up there! Let's go upstairs, sweetie. - Let's have a drink first. She's busy. You can go upstairs with me if you like. Only no touching. Please... Stop! Stop that! Please! Saska! Saska, where are you? They raped me! Where's my sister, you ape? - Calm down. Where's my sister? Saska! Leave me alone! Saska! Let me out! Right, now you can phone Mummy and tell her everything's all right. All right, when you've calmed down a bit. So that's it! I get you work permits for the best price in the EU. And you fuck me up, is that it? What were you thinking, that everything in life is brill? Look, you half-wit I'm talking to you. No more messing around or I'll kill you. Do I make myself clear? Come on! Puki, you can lock the door afterward. And then... The second night, I had nine of them all over me. The third night, eleven. After that, I stopped counting. They threatened to put the videos on the Internet and send them to our parents. Every time they punished us in a different way. Usually they punished one girl for another girl's mistakes. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your will be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Saska... We'll run away from here. HOW? I'll think of something, don't worry. Be sure of that. Wait. Sit down and let's chat a little first. It's always interested me how you can do all this. I suppose it's the money, but how can you do it with all these types? I don't know, for me it would be really repulsive. I don't quite understand you, do you want to do it or not? I can't, I'm sorry. My mates forced me to. We had our exams, and... Can we wait here for a bit and then I'll go downstairs? Is that all right or have I done something wrong? No, everything's all right. Did they force you to do this? Listen, my father isn't just anyone. He's got lots of good connections. I can help you. You don't have to be here if you don't want to. And if you want, I'll help you. I don't know. He wanted to call some SOS number. But his father called Tadija. He didn't want it to get out that his son had been with whores. Yes, but why don't you tell this to the police. It would help them. Get up! Get up when I tell you, for fuck's sake! Girls, I'm sorry for waking you like this. The situation is very urgent. One of you tried to pull a fast one on me last night. We can't allow that, can we? We'll have to punish that. Come here! Don't, don't! Come here, I tell you! Last night one of you talked with people of your age. Isn't that so? No, it's... Now clean up all this chaos here! I understand you're scared, but I shall have to tell this to the police. I'm going to tell the police. - No! Yes! It's a matter of murder! - I shouldn't have told you! I can't keep quiet about it. - They'll kill Saska as well. She didn't cross the Italian border, that much we know. At least not under her own name. I'm telling you, it's that night club Florence... Do you remember what it was called before. Venice? And before, Verona. - Yes, let's talk about Tadija. It seems to me that Marija mentioned someone called Tadija. There! Three times we busted him and found nothing. We really did the place over, but there were no girls. I really don't understand. What don't you understand? The local police told us about him. Let's not make fools of ourselves. Remember that chap from Mladenovac a few years ago, who on Wednesday's had a day off for the police? Let's stop squabbling, it wasn't years ago, it was decades ago. For years we've been arresting them, but the court lets them off, or encourages them with light sentences. - I'm not the court. The prosecutor's office collects evidence with you. There's someone called Ljubica. They blackmail her with her child. Somewhere in Bosnia. - That's for Interpol. Find the child. Hide him in a safe place. -Of course. Before you start anything serious. What concrete evidence do we have? We've got precisely nothing. No, we've got Florence". And Marija... We know her sister's there. And we've got the girl with the child. And a girl from Moldavia. And a murder. Is Marija going to talk to us? Not yet, she needs a little more time. This turns round and this lights up, then this goes up and down again. Are you all right? -Give me something to wipe myself with. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Laza, happy birthday to you! Wish for something. - She's already wished. No she hasn't. Come on! - The cake, come on. Come on, for Laza! - Cheers, cheers! I only smoke thin ones. Meaning this big! This is ours, a fat one. - That's fine, it's fine. Come on, sing something, please. Marija, how many did you have last night? Five. Five? You're not trying hard enough. You're in permanent debt. Twelve euros for sanitary towels, five for the glass you broke the other day. There are other things I don't count, they're on the house. If you don't try enough, I'll have to send you. Do you know what that means? What? I don't know. - You don't know? You'll go to Kosovo, my girl, and there's no future there. You really must try harder. You? What's the matter? We're not jolly like we were to start with? Listen. Bosko called me from Banja Luka yesterday. He passed by your house. He says your son's very sweet. What? Not even a thank you for telling you this? What's up with you all? Liven up! I can't look at you like this! And you, you cow! What are you looking at? Nobody says hello to me, or smiles at me or says thank you, Tadija. Have I deserved this? He lost some money gambling and they're coming to fleece him. Gosh, I'm so sorry. You silly girl... Look what he's given me. Saska, what are you talking about? You're out of your mind. You're a fool. Tadija looks after us. How would it be with someone else? Idiot, you tell him everything we talk about here. Don't talk to me like that. You're a fool. -I told you not to talk to me like that. Hello, girls! My lads don't get it. They ask how Tadija makes such a brill sauce. And I tell them the trick's in the mustard. Try it. It's brill. - Brill! You've no idea. You asked me what it was like. - I didn't ask you to answer me. I know it's brill, but you don't know how to tell me why it's brill. Because it's really the tops. -Well, yes. You'll learn. Each one to his own. And now have a few words with your mother, and when your sis calms down, she can say a few words too. Hello, Mummy. It's great! We've got a job and we'll send you money. Mummy, I don't know when we'll... No... Okay. Mummy, bye! Marija... Marija! Hello, Mummy? Yes, everything's super. Saska's super, she's grown. We'll call later so as not to run up a bill. I love you, Mummy. Leave your sister for a bit, come on. What you noticed with Saska was a fear for her very life. It's known as the Stockholm syndrome. That's the reason. Perhaps he's already sold her. I think we can get her out of there. But he has strong connections and knows everything. All sorts of important blokes come there, from the local council. That famous actor was there. I can't remember his name. I know. But on the other hand, there are our police, Interpol, IOM, non-governmental organizations that fight against this trading. Why don't you want to talk? Thanks, Olga. What happened to Olga, how did she get the scar on her back? They removed a kidney. They'd probably have removed the other if she hadn't been found. You don't have to give evidence. But help us to rescue the girls. We need to know where they hide the girls when they hear of a raid. Marija, you ran away from there. Help us to save Saska. Let's play dice. Ljubica, just go, will you! Tadija's brill. He's going to send Mummy some money for a car. And he showed me the money he's keeping for us. I feel sick. And I think one of my teeth is loose. Marija, please, go to bed. I've eaten too much. Why are you such an old hen? Go to bed. You're not well. No, Marija, I'm brill. Look at all the things he's brought us to eat. Where have you been until now, for Christ's sake? What are you gawping at? Can't you see my sister's not well? You shouldn't drink so much. What are you saying? Who are you to say such a thing? Haven't you got anything better to do? Go and do some washing! Why do you look at me like that? Like some queen in her palace! I'll go and do some washing. - Go then! Off you go, you cow! Come on, get dressed and on deck. Come on! Husa, what do you say? Take it easy mate. Good merchandize today? Look at this one, and... How much is this one? - Two grand. What do you say? -Too much. - How much do you have? Three grand. - Take her and take another two. Come on, look at these. Come on girls. Let's have a smile. Good merchandise? Gently, little one... What's the matter? This one's aggressive. - Look at this chick. Smile. She's a bit grumpy. - But she can dance, old boy. Well, let's see. - Come on then! -Off we go! That's it, my pussycat, off we go! Come here. - That's it. That's lovely. A tigress? Come on. She's worth every penny. You want her? - Yes. Empty your wallet, old boy. Open your mouth. Off you go. What have you done? -I installed that ordinary insulation. Fuck it. Good for the wife, good for the kids. Fuck that, my place is damp. - Why build there when it's damp? The view. -Fuck the view. What good's the view? It's big... The smaller the man, the bigger the problem. Here you are. - What do I need that for? Perhaps it's yours. - Throw it away. Let's go for a drink. She won't go anywhere now. Let's go. I'll kill myself if anything happens to her. Boss, they're calling from Germany. There's no merchandise for Hamburg. Cancel it. Police! Lie down! Police! Police! Hands in the air! It's clean! Let's go outside, girls. Some on, slowly now. It's clean! Come on, get them up. The Serbian Home Office and Public Prosecutor for organized crime wish you good day. Welcome. Would you like something to drink? We'll have a drink, but without you. Tadija Tasic, you're under arrest. You're being especially witty today. It's no joke. Photograph these injuries here. Come on, a bit more lively. These two in the back. Mind your head. Katarina, let's have the girls in the van. No one needs urgent medical attention. Let's go. Are you the boss? - Yes. -Are you arresting us? You girls aren't under arrest. - I want the boss! Where are my personal things? - We'll bring them. I'll kill you, tear you apart. Tadija will kill you. Leave me alone. Take it easy. Come on, in the back. What's the matter, Saska? It's over! You're not there any more! Understand? I'm not going to sit in this hen coop and be dragged round the courts! Tadija's a monster! - You're a monster! Take it easy, Saska. - Leave me alone! The maniac photographed every girl he bought and sold. That makes our job somewhat easier. Shall I send the pictures to everyone in Zone 2? Yes. I think most of them will have ended up in the European Union. Four victims are taken care of. We've got plenty of evidence. It would be best if they agree to give evidence. Look, a book with all their debts. I'll kill him. I've got a shotgun and I'll kill him. He's going to be dead. Mr. Rade, don't be like that. Threats don't help. Saska, my child, we all know they forced you. Nobody's angry with you. Say what happened and let the beast end up where he deserves. Everything will be all right. - Everything's all right already. What do you want me to say? - Tell them how it all was. How was it? What's important is that we're all together again. You give your statements on your own, individually. Calmly, slowly, composed. The whole truth. If they ask for confrontation... I hope this won't happen because they can be really rough and provocative. They tell lies. They say all sorts of stupid and repulsive things. But if this happens, do your best to look straight at me. They will place you so that you can always see me or Katarina. Don't be frightened of anything, they can't harm you any more. I suggest evidence is given by the witnesses confronting my defendant. I oppose this because it would mean secondary victimization and additional stress for the witnesses who have already given clear statements. Thank you. But the accused would be deprived of the right to defend himself. The court decides that the evidence will be given through confrontation. The injured party Marija Radic will stand and approach the bench. Stand there. Please, call the accused, Tadija Tasic. The beast. Face each other, look each other in the eye and say what you have to say. Why did you lie that I beat you and that you weren't allowed to go out? You did beat me. I went out once, when you took me to a client. Ridiculous. How did you get away if you weren't free to go out? You sold me on. That's how I left. Sweetie, what have I done to you that makes you lie like this? It's you who have lied. You're making all this up. What sponges, what burning? Come off it, it's all farcical. You made me carry a sponge when I had my period. A kitchen one, too. We all had to do the same. Saja burned my facial hair. You blackmailed me with my child. It's all true. Child? You have a child? It's the first time I've heard of it. Poor child with such a mother. You're lying through your teeth. You were a super dancer and only went with clients when you wanted. Nobody forced you, did they? Important people came to my place. Such people that I would go off with, isn't that so? Not in my case. If you hadn't forced me every day for three years. Why are you all lying? It was you who planned the murder. I fed you and now you want to send me to prison? You killed her. I object to the defenses request for confrontation in this case. The psychologist testified that the witness has Stockholm syndrome. She has already given evidence that is sufficient. If she could give evidence, she can also confront the defendant. Your honor, I request that we complete the confrontation. I ask the injured party Aleksandra Radic to approach the bench. Please, tell each other what you have to say. Do you stand by your earlier statements? Yes, I do. - And you? I stand by them as well. Look me in the eye. Look me in the eye, Saska. It's me you're addressing. Do you stand by the nonsense you were talking? Is that the way to thank me? I invest in you... Tell the people and we can part company. I've said everything, I've nothing to add. What have you said? Say here that everything you've said is the truth. It is the truth. Tadija made that girl... And all the girls... I don't know. - What don't you know? Look at me, it's me you're addressing. Say you killed her, you forced us to do all that, you abused us, you're a criminal, Tadija. Go on, say it. Please, I can't do all this. Please, these are all lies and we all know they are lies. I don't know why we're saying all this when we made a lot of money. I worked as PR for the club and I'm not going to lie. I was the club's PR. I mean, the murder? It's nonsense. We all know it was an accident. I'm not a whore. I'm a PR and I beg you to end this once and for all. I'm sorry, Tadija. For a witness to change her evidence is not rare. Victims of human trafficking often lose their self-confidence, their identity, and they become dependent on the criminal. I'm sorry that while observing the law the court didn't recognize what effects confrontation could leave on the victim's future life. But the court must consider all the motives for a change of evidence. That the victims were tricked, and sexually exploited by force. They had no freedom of movement and were witnesses to a murder. In their statements they don't deny that they practiced prostitution. But we must differentiate between human trafficking and prostitution. We refer to one of the most profitable forms of organized crime. All the cited material evidence and statements of the victims confirm that all the accused committed this crime. I consider that the court should find them guilty of the crime of human trafficking according to Article 388 together with the crime of first degree murder, Article 114, and pass the maximum sentence that the law allows. Marija... Hello! - Hi! How's it going? - So-so. And you? Nothing much. I've got a brother. -Yes? He's 16, he hasn't... Would you... What about 1000 dinars? Think about it. Say the price. Hello, Katarina. Happy New Year. We're fine. I'd like to come to Belgrade to work with you. Fine. I will. Thanks, we'll be in touch. Bye. What does she say? She says, to collect all my documents and come to Belgrade. I can't stay here with you any longer. I can't manage without Saska. Forgive me. Forgive me, my dearest... I'll never forgive myself for taking her with me. It's my fault. I must find her. We'll find her. You mustn't fall back into the chain. What about when that beast comes out of prison? He only got 15 years. - Don't think about that now. Try to start your life again from the beginning, now. How much do you want for this one? -Eight hundred. Too much. - Seven hundred fifty. And what's this? - A pretty girl. Pretty? You can see she's damaged goods. What could I do with her? Come on, how much? - Five hundred. -Four. Four hundred. - Three hundred fifty. You can have her for six. - Five hundred. Seven hundred. - Six hundred twenty. -Fifty. Wait a moment, I've got something else for you. And this is... -She came of her own accord. -Really? But as it's New Year, she's on the house. -Great!
