God mom. I'm Christine. This is Paul. I am Lynne and this is my embarraced daughter Mykaela. I guess we are all on the same boat today. Or bus I suppose. Yeah, from a dump to a ruin. - Eey! - I think I'm a like this guy. Oh. Ok. Come come inside. Ok. Welcome. Come come. Welcome, to pompeii. Now... We all know what cause pompeii to fall to ruin, yes? Yes. Tour Guide: The erruption. The Volcano. Tour Guide: And there she is. Mount vesuvius. Yes of course. Mount vesuvius explode and covered the city in ash. But can anyone tell me when the volcano exploded and destroyed our beautiful pompeii? Tour Guide: Yes miss? 79 A.D.? Tour Guide: Pefecto Miss. Can you tell us more about Vesuvius? Uh ok. It's probably the most dangerous volcano in the world. Because 3 million people live near by, All though there is some despute about the name, it's likely a hybridized Greek and Latin word meaning "unquenchable". Perfecto. feel free to explore. Tour Guide: Mount Vesuvius has erupted more than 50 times. Tour Guide: The eruption in 79 A.D. was the most famous, of course. Tour Guide: The dust "Poured across the land" like a flood, Tour Guide: one witness wrote, and shrounded the city in " a darkness... Tour Guide: liked the black of closed and unlighted room. Tour Guide: Two thousand people died, and the city was abandoned for almost as many years. Tour Guide: It wasn't until 1748 that a group of explorers rediscovered the site, Tour Guide: surprised to find that underneath a thick layer of Tour Guide: dust and debris pompeii was perfectly intact. Follow me. Throughfare! Move! Watch out! Hey honey. Did you feel that? Yes we felt it. Everything ok? Ok? Some of the ruins collapsed. I think even some of the people are hurt. Are you and Mykaela ok? Yeah we're fine. We're fine. Mykalea and I are fine. I don't want you to worry about that baby. Look, I'm going to reschedule. I'm gonna come get you guys. No honey. Really, we're fine. We're just shooken up a bit, that's all. I'm sure we're gonna be back on the bus and back in town any minute now, ok? You sure? I'm positive. I do not want you to miss that meeting baby. Mykaela wants to talk to you. We'll see you tonight. How are you guys? Ok? Is there any place to get a coffee dude? Love you. Hi dad. Hey princess. You ok? Yeah I'm fine. But? What is it? This morning at the news stand I saw tha there had been an eruption in the Galapagos. They said there's been seismic activity everywhere. But then... I have read so many times that there's always activity near an active volcano. What are you saying? Do you think you and your mom are in danger? No. No. Everything's fine. I'm just being paranoid dad. No no no princess. That's all right. Look... I'll call you when I'm done, ok? Dad seriously, everything is fine. Don't panic. Really, me and mom have it under control. Good luck. Ok thanks. You and mom be safe. Bye dad. Bye princess. And make sure you keep those sat. phones- Hello? Everything ok? Yeah. Mr. Pierce. Very pleased to meet you. I'm Victtore Fabricio, Senior Vice President of operations. Please call me Jeff, sir. Wonderful. Uh this way. Mr. Rosso and the others are waiting. Gianni. Yes. How do we get out of this place? We'll try the enterence first. If that doesn't work we try Porta Sarno. The gate by the- By the amphitheater. Hey, on the other side of the city. Ok. Here, this way. Lynne. I must confess. I am amazed at your daughter's knowledge of the city and our fearsome volcano. Yeah she does her best to keep us amazed. That's for sure. Tell me, how is it you are so drawn to volcanoes? My dad was away a lot when I was a kid. Marines. Whenever he went away somewhere I'd read everything I could about the place he was stationed. Everything from local customs, to the way the land was formed. Knowing about where he was, ready did make me feel closer to him. The more I read, the more I realized how much I loved learning about the earth. While other girls were playing with dolls, I was playing with rocks. There is much to study in Italy. Perhaps one day you can come live with us when you are a famous geologist. I would die to live in Italy. That's another small one right? Perhaps we should... Go! Quickly. RUN! I of course could Implement it and have it up and running in 3 months. - Seems like a plan. - Ok Mio dio! Vesuvius. Do you have a helicopter? Excuse me? Does this company have a helicopter? Mr. Pierce. I need to use it. Mr. Rosso my family is in pompeii. I'm sorry but I cannot. Not for this. If you try to fight Vesuvius you will die. I promise you. Jeff, please you have to listen to Mr. Rosso. You cannot go to Pompeii. Mykaela? Mom? That's bad. Honey, you there? Jeff. We're ok but the volcano has- I know. You gotta find shelter. Somewhere sturdy with cover. Find it. I'll be there soon. - Are you guys alright? - Is everything ok? I don't think you should. No. Stay there. I'm coming for you. I love you Jeff but- Lynne. Jeff? Lynne! Jeff? Dammit! Stay away Jeff. Come on. come on. Move move move. Thank you. Excuse me sir? No I have to get through here. Get back. No one gets through. My wife and daughter are in Pompeii. I have yo get through. Pompeii? Pompeii is ground zero. No one is going there. Get back in your car. No you don't understand, I have to get there. Back in car now. Easy buddy. Back in car or I arrest you. Go. You play nintendo. Hello Carlo, Yeah I'll be right there. Dammit! Come on! Ok Yeah. Carlo. God no one's called me that in a few years. - My dear friend it's good to see you. - You too. - Despite the cercumstances. - Tell me something good. As soon as I got your call, I sent out a request to the top of the Italian Government. There's no go I'm afraid. This is a- Pompeii is strickly off limits. The whole area is off limits. We are on stand by to eveacuate Naples. No no no no, you don't understand this is my wife and daughter we're talking about here. You think I don't understand that? You think I don't remember that debt I owe you from Canada. I tell you this is a major international crisis. I would help you if there was anyway- There is a way. there's always a way. You know that. You're special ops. I was special ops in the days when I was carlo. Now I'm cornel Dylard. NATO liazon. I'm a pen pusher. You're the same guys. Come on Carlo. Come on man. There's also something else you don't know... How bad? I just spoke to the head of science at Sapienza di Roma. Pompeii will be under sixty feet of lava within four hours. Sorry. Come on. Get in. Where am I going? Where are you going? There's nothing we can do. You can't stop the bloody volcano man. Come on. Get down! Don't touch it! Go! Here! Come on! Is that safe? It's safer then out here. Go! Over there. That's it. You're gonna be alright. Mom. I'll be fine. It looks readlly bad. Oh my god. You realize these guys will give you the same answer as the Italian Goverment? Still gotta try. Right. B ut if you get the answer that I think they're going to give you, I'll wait outside for you. and meet you in an hour. Ok. What are you planning? Plan B. Just in case your plan A doesn't plan out. I'm not the only person in Italy that owes you a favor. Good luck old boy. Thanks. Right. Next time I say "Let's go get coffee". Let's go get coffee. Here let me help you. Thank you. Hey. Here. You saved my life out there. We were just in the neighborhood. Thanks. I'm Naveen. And that's Rashida. I'm Lynne. Mykaela. Thank you. It's a hell of a day huh? Tell me about it. This morning Naveen said that he felt something important was gonna happen to us today. Me and my big mouth huh? Hey. There ya go. Thanks man. Next time I won't visit a natural disaster. If there's even a next time. Paul! I can't be the only one thinking that. Hey. You ok? Yeah. I guess. It was really lucky that you founde this place, ok? It's exactly what your dad said to find. You did really good. You did really good baby. In theory we should be ok here. It withstood the last eruption after all. Unless it's worse this time. Worse? Can it really get any worse? Mr. Pierce please believe me. We'd like nothing better then to assist you in locating your wife and your daughter. All I'm asking for is transport sir. Believe me Captain, I don't doubt your ability but as I said, it's not that easy. It is. That easy. It is not that easy. You heard what your friend said CO said. Word from the Italian goverment, is that everybody is coming out. Nobody is going in. Certainly no civilians. God only knows how they feel about some black ops commando- Exactly. I'm black ops. I can make this a cougar operation. Sir please, believe me we're trying to keep you safe. This is my wife and daughter. Mr. Pierce I get it. We're talking about a volcanic eruption. Jeff: I've done it before. Many times. That's my job! Look I want to help you. Really I do. Neither you or I can stop a volcano. ... we are now receiving reports from Niihau Hawaii, where a ring of volcanoes have risen from the ocean, endangering air traffic and local population... In a little over 3 hour Pompeii will be gone. Right now the only thing I can do is try and keep you safe. That's it. I'm sorry. That's what we're dealing with. So you are not gonna help me. No Mr. Pierce I can't. We're heading out of Naples in an hour. I f you're you'll be coming with us. If not... God help you man. You guys have everything in those packs. Our whole lives are in there. We've been backpacking through Europe for the past 3 months. Naveen is hard to persuade when he gets an idea in his head. Like you were putting up a fight. Are you two married? Uh Not quite yet. No. It's complicated. Are you getting a signal with that? No. Then you might want to conserve your battery when we get signal at some point. Really? What's your deal dude? Oh sorry. I work for a travel blog back home. Just fly around the world, take photos of tourist traps. My first trip to Italy. It's exciting. Hey... Did you hear that? What? I don't hear anything? I think it stopped. I don't think so. Well? Looks like I'm on my own. Oh no you're not. You work fast. Good guys have friends. We are not much. You're all the paper pushers you could dig up. Yeah the best I could do at short notice. Good to see you soldier. Captain Pierce. Look what the cat dragged in. Always looking for work. I'm glad I'm not doing this on my own. Cane. Never leave you hanging boss. The old band's officially back together for one night only. We hear you got a problem? Yeah. The size of a mountain. Your family? They're at ground zero. We're getting them out. Come on. Let's go. I can't thank you enough. It was the least I could do. There is much I still owe you. Thank. Oh um, There is one thing. Anything. Anything at all. Could you get me a chopper? Military grade? Are you out of your mind? I'm Nato leazon. This isn't even my country. I will get me court Martial. Alright alright. You're right. You're absolutly right. I'll figure it out. Yes I'm sure you will. Good luck. Good luck. Dinner when you come home. If you come home. We got gear? Locked and loaded. The whole kit, but lacking the kaboodle. We don't have conveyance. Yeah. We're gonna get a chopper. We need something large enough to hold cargo for transport and extraction, Plus we need to land on a dime. basically means we need something fast and agile to ge us out of trouble. It's gonna be a war zone out there. I could call us a favor to the British Army. No we don't have time. Ah! Damn! Back it up. Back it up! So we need to secure a chopper here in Naples, and fast. Yep. I'm guessing, civilian option is out of the question. Any ideas? Yeah. I know that look. What are you planning? Something Carlo is not gonna like. If there are many more of that size, I don't know wether this villa is gonna hold. Ok were else can we go Mykaela? Sweetie you have been reading books about volcanos as long as I can remember. Can you think of some place else? So place that's safer? Crap. Wait. Christine, do you still have that map of pompeii? Yes. Yes I do. Right. So... We are here. We need to get to here. We should get ready to move like now! We need to get there before what happens next. Why? What happens next? You don't want to know. Tell us. The heat surge. How much heat are we talking? Enough. EVERYBODY GO! NOW! Mom! Run! Here. What's that? Just take it. Come on. Go. Go Go. PAUL! Where are we headed? The only place that has the ride me need. JFC Naples? Isn't that a NATO base? Yeah it's an Italian Post. It's the hard way. As usual. Just the way I like it. Oh come on. Take a right here. Come on! How much time do we have? According to Carlo, only a couple of hours. Hold on hold on. Let's have a look. Let's help him with that car. Come on. Jeff stop. You hear that? Looks like we should have actually stayed home. We need to move. Incoming! Move! Move! Move! Move! Ok. So the rocks have stopped. That's good right? It's good if you don't want to be hit by flamming rocks but, It's not good if you don't like heat. We need to keep moving. How much further? Not far. The roof is intact. Come on. Everyone inside. Whoa. This looks like a death trap to me. We can see the entrance from here. Why can't we just keep going? We don't have time. When the heat surge hits, there is no way we could out run it. What? Are we just suppose to believe you? You will do well to listen to her. Alright. Listen to the girl that almost got us killed inside a collaping ruin. There's nothing falling from the sky? This is our chance to get out of here. Please come with us. Wait guys, seriously. Please. Come on. I mean, they're kinda right. It's really small in here. Good? Yeah. Better then I expected. We need to shut this door. It will help to block the heat wave, when it hits. Ok Mykaela, are you sure that this is alright? In 1902 a volcano erupted on martinique. There was only one survivor: a man in a jail cell. Everybody unpack or take off the close you don't need. I need your water too. sure. Thanks. Thanks mom. Here. Thanks. Wait. What are you doing with the water? We may need this. I need to soak the clothes to plug the cracks on the door. That's what the survivor or Martinique did to stay alive. Except he had to use his own urine. Hmm. Thanks. What do you think cap.? We're not gonna catch them with their pants down. But there are gaps. What do you think? Distruction or evasion? A little of both. So give us the run down. Targets one o'clock. Those choppers are exactly what we need. They're gunships not rescue vehicles. They won't be used for ANY civilian rescue operation. We're not hurting the rescue effort. Right. We're just adding some fire power. Once we get into the air and over Pompeii, It'll be just like being back in the sand box... only a little worse. Exactly. It's why we have to be in the offensive. How do we get in? We find a whole in the perimiter. Then we stealth in, but we'll need a distraction on the outside. I'll cover that part. Saved me from asking. You know me, I just like blowing things up. Game on. When do we move? How about now? Times a ticking. and uh, minimal force. Keep your heads down. This is why I listen to you. I expect that to be tattooed on your forehead when we get home. This is it. The surge. Mykaela. Yeah mom. I am so-so proud of you. baby. Mom. You are the best - best child anyone could have ever asked for. I love you so much. I'm sorry Rashida. It's not your fault. Look, if we make it out of this, I promise... I know. Oh my god. Oh my god. We made it. That was it? I mean... This doesn't seem real. None of this makes any sense. It's over now, right? We can rest up here for a few minutes. That's the worst of it, right? Come on! This is far from over. I feel naked doing this in broad daylight. You're loosing youe nerve hurricane? Hell no. Sorry Carlo. Do it. I know, he's late. Any minute now. It should be about time now. That our cue. Come on. Come on baby. Start off for me. We gotta go! I know I knmow, I'm on it. Hold on. Alright here we go. Oh my god. So. Tell us who's the volcano expert. Who we gonna die next. Our main concern is the surfuric gas. For the time being at least. Deadly in high doses, we'd have to be near alot of ash to pose an emidiate threat. How much ash? A lot of ash, like 10 feet of more, We have to go now. Hey. What is it? I aould telll it's something else? Nothing anyone else has to worry about. Mykalea if there is more danger there isn probaly we need to know about it ok? It's just if Vesuvius decides to erupt again, it's gonna get worse with every eruption. How much worse? Ever heard of crackatoa? Alright, where is he? There. Let's pick him up. Alita, open up. Come on. Come on. Come on cowboy. Hey hey hey hey. You ok soldier? Thanks. Are come on. Hold on hold on. We're off. This is more fun the taking kabul from the taliban. He's gonna bleed out. You alright cane? Thanks Cade. Just don't pass out till we get there. Actually don't pass out till we get back. That's why you call me hurricane. Cause I'm unstopple baby. No they call you hurricane because you are full of hot air. Alright guys come on. Let's focus. Cane, I need you up here. Come on. Alita you're on coms. Copy that. You good? Five by five. Good ahead and had her to me captain. She's all yours. I've got it. What's our ETA? We should be there in 35 minutes. Keep her floored. Well I'll be dammed. Well alright. Come on everybody. Having any luck? You never know. Mom, the sat phones. Yeah, well... I think I lost mine back at the Villa. It's ok, I still go... Must have fall out when I fell. Well we're quite a pair, aren't we? What do you think? I don't know. Seems right. I think we should go in. Are you ok? Yeah yeah I'm fine. Don't worry. Are you sure? It's ok. Come on. What now? Mud slide! Go go go! Just go! Come on! Just go! Go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. The mud slide brought in a lot of ash. That means there's gonna be a- What? Vocanic ash that you were talking about earlier? And there's a lot of dirt in there too, right? Maybe there isn't enough ash to make it a problem? Like - Like you were saying. Maybe. I'm no expert. I could get us all killed. No. Dude, we'd be dead already if it wasn't for you. None of us know jack about volcanos. We're following you. It's gonna be ok. Ok. So... What's our next move boss? I'm not sure. Dammit. Nothing. Um... Hey guys. We've got company. How the hell are they gaining on us. They're all the same helicopter, right? What's our speed? I'm cracking and banking. I don't know what the hell is going on. Maybe they have jettisoned ballast. or maybe they're more outfitted for attack instead of transport. Or maybe we stole the slowest god damn helicopter in the Italian army. Cade! Secure that door. What? I was just gonna take a few shots. get them off our back. A lot can happen with a granade launcher. I'm not killing innocent soldiers. Please be advised we have instructions to return you to base at once. Please be advised that we are under orders shoot if you will not comply. Do you understand. We will shoot you out of the sky, unless you turn around now. Jeff, please don't do this. Return to base with us immediatly. I'm sorry Carlo I have too. Sir, we are almost within firing distance, sir. Fire a couple warning shots. Fire now. Cane, how far are we? I could get us to that cloud with in 3 minutes. But they are gonna be within firing range in 1. I think they're in fising range now. Yeah. Crap. When I said warning shots I didn't mean hit him! Do you understand? Yes sir. Right! Will not happen again sir. It will not happen again sir. Other wise they can get court martialed. Should I persue though sir? Pursue pursue. You are instructed to pursue. You use every trick you got. But you get us into that cloud, got it? You guys might wanna buckle up for this part. Good job. 2 left. Almost within firing range sir. Wait wait wait wait. Thinks about this. If you fire now, any shots that you miss could hit the civilian population trying to leave a volcanic eruption down below. My advise would be close up. Yes sir. I got this. Crap. No no no no, when I say pull up, I don't mean fly up his ass. Ok. Let's see who's got the biggest cajones. Cane! You really have to do this? Yeah he does. If he jigs left, let him go. Too many civilians are out there. If he jigs right, you could shoot. Uh sir, the microphone is on sir. Mic was- yeah. My apologies. Hey it happens sir. 2 to 3 hotel, be advised we have a firing solution on you. They got a lock. Oh no they don't. 1-0-6 - Whoa! Did you see that? Did you see that. - Yes sir. That's a commuter aircraft. That is a civilian in the area. Whatever you do, abort abort abort. Aborting sir. Abordng 1-0-6 returning. Alright. Take us there. We've got company. How's your ankle? It will be alright. This reminds me of the night raids on Baghdad during the Gulf War. Only this is much worse. That's weird. This remins me of hell. We should be over Pompeii in 15. Uh so when we get there, how the hell are we gonna find them? They are not likely to be out in the open. And ruins. There is a lot of ground to cover in the little time we have. Before Mykaela and Lynne left I made them take Sat. phones with them. So we can just call. No good. have been trying snce we left Naples. All the phones have GPS tracking. They tether to one another. Provided that they are all functional. Bingo. One of them is still up. The coordinates. Mykaela. Are you down here? Hey mom. You ok? Yeah. I just got a bit of a headache. There. The Pompeii Museum. Good. Cane. When we get to Pompeii look for a free standing 4 story building. It shouldn't be too hard to find. Roger that. We have 45 minutes left for extraction. Don't worry Cap. We'll find them. Where's Christine? Christine! Christine! Mykaela. We have to go! Everyone! We have to go! Now! Mom Mom - Breathe. Kai Help me. - Come on. Where's Christine? Follow me. This way! Quick! Does anyone have any clothes that I can use. I need clothes and water! Help me tear this coth into strips. Keep the baking soda over your mouth and breath through that, ok? It should obsorb that gas which is in the air. In theory. What the hell was that? Mom it's your phone! This is yours? I thought it was one of those electronic tour guide things or something- I think dad's been trying to track us. Come on. We need to get to higher ground. Sir. What is it? Do you still have contact? Negative. The connection is gone. Damn. Doesn't change anything. We still start at the museum. Same plan. Eye on the prize. Jesus. You guys get strapped in. We're gonna be coming in really hot. Double time. Come on. Come on! This thing is solid. At least it's keeping the gas out. Another earthquake? Not this time. You don't happen to have any dynimite in that bag, do you? Not even a firecracker. Ok, well we've gotta do something. Dad was certainly searching us on the sat phone before it got smashed. It had to be him. He knows where we are. Do you think that the signal went through? It's possible. if there's a way, Jeff will find it. And the way you keep talking about this dude, makes him sound like some sort of super hero or something. Yeah well, he kinda is. Hey I'm the first to get in line to get rescued by super dad. He'll be here. I know it. It's too dangerous. She's right. There's even the slightest chance in hell that he can get to us, he will. That's what he did for a living for god sakes. How we doing Cane? Touchdown 90 seconds boss. Alright. Let's do this. Look, even if he is coming the bad news is that we can't stay here much longer. That second eruption a few minutes ago, That means that there is a chance of a pyroclastic flow. A what? When a volcano erupts, it can heat up a rock so hot that it turns into gas. That creates a flow that washes over the ground kind of like Like a tidal wave. It's probably dangerous, right? According to the books, it can travel 450 miles per hour. And reach temperature of 4,000 degrees celcius so, kinda. Still no contact? No. Alright, we gotta asume they are still at the museum. We have less then 30 minutes to get in there, find them, and get the hell out. I want it done in 10. Copy? - Yeah. - Copy. Alright. Visibility is less them zero, so I need the flashlights. You better hit the ground running. Cane, do you have enough room to land on the roof? The structure seems sound enough but I'm not risking a touchdown. I'm gonna keep it right above and keep the engine running for ya. Alright copy. Let's go. 10 minutes.We search every inch and then we're gone, copy? Copy. Alright. Let's go. It's dad. It's gotta be! It has to be. Lynne! Mykaela! Guys. Let's do this already. They will find us and they will get us out of here. But how can you know that? I know my husband. 5 more minutes please. 5 more minutes. Lynne! Mykaela! Check those rooms over there. Hello? Mrs. Pierce? Lynne! Mykaela! Jeff! Are you in there? Dad! Hey! Hey we're right here! You guys in there? We're here! We're in here!
