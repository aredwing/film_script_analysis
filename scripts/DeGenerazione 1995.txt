Don't try to reassure me, this is a really bad situation... If we go on like this they'll fuck us up! Relax, what can they do? - What can they do! - Something's not right... Peppuccio, Ettore, Gabriele, what happened to them? Where they fuck are they? Tell me! Where do you think? They're at the Ministry asking for an Article 28. Stop fooling around, I'm not in the mood. Are we going to Venice? What is that noise? Answer me? Answer me? What the fuck is going on? Who is it? I haven't done anything! What's happening to me? Those kids are driving me crazy. Thank God! It was just a hallucination. No, it's just a fun reality. The Degenerates HOME DELIVERY Good Evening Good evening, Ma'am. Do you remember me? I was there yesterday. I'm the one who bought the wooden chest. Exactly, that's me. Excuse me, I've been thinking about it. It's really important to me. My apartment looks empty without it. Can't you deliver it to my home today? What do you mean tomorrow? I've already paid you for it. Yes, that's true. The problem is that it is too late. The delivery man has taken the afternoon off. I don't know... This shouldn't be a problem. Tell him I'll give him a big tip. It's not a matter of money. The problem is he is taking the day off. And I don't want to... I already promised him... um... I'm begging you. It's important. Nicola must see the chest when he gets home. For us, this is very important. We're celebrating our first month in this house. I beg you! I don't know if... ...I can do anything. I'm begging you! I'd really like to help you. At least ask the delivery man. I'm sure he'll agree. Very well. I'll talk to him. Thank you, thank you! Please mention the big tip. Make sure you tell him. But you must promise to be home after 6:30. I'm asking you as a personal favor. Please don't let me down. Don't worry. I'll be home at that time. No Problem. Hello? Alessio, what's wrong? Really? No, no. I Can't. I have a commitment. How could I do that? Yes. Very well. I'll be there. But I must be home by 6:30. Very good. Yes. Francesca? Hey, Francie Francesca? You must return the book you borrowed. Bye. Oh, so nobody's there? I'm busy. I don't have time for this shit. If nobody is there in 10 minutes, I'm leaving. Whatever. RECIPES Hello? Hello, who is this? Whatever. Finally. Leave the door open. I'm coming in. Whatever. Who are you? Santa Claus Now open the door or I'll break it down! Hey, what the fuck? Let me in now or I'll kill you! Go away! I don't know you! Are sure you don't know me. You won't let me inside? I told you to leave. Watch out, Or I'll hurt you. That's right, bitch. Whatever. OK, cut the shit and give me my tip. Look... I think there's been a mistake. The only mistake you made is not giving me my tip. Now make it fast. Uh... yeah... tip... Just a minute, I'll get it... - Ah, good. - See? That's not so hard. That son of a bitch! Hello? Hello! Hello, Precinct 113. Hello? Who's there? Who is this? Is someone in trouble? Should we dispach an officer? Hello? Hello? Respond! Do you need assistance? Hello? Hel- Hello? Honey, the line's been busy. I was worried. Did you get my surprise? Surprise? Ah... The wood chest. So it was delivered. Did you give the man a big tip? I told them it HAD to be delivered today. Anyway, happy anniversary. I should be home in a little while. Goodbye, my love. I'm sorry you found it like this. It was supposed to be a surprise. Some present. You even had to give the guy a tip. It looks good over here, eh? This present wasn't intended for doing this on top of it... But why not? Wait here. I've got something for you too. Hello? Orazio. Hi, how are you? Here's your tip, bastard. Have you ever met a drunk vampire? This isn't a joke. Very good... ...let me tell you about it. I didn't believe it in the beginning, either. It was a couple of weeks ago... I felt lonely, so I went for a walk by the shore. There's a great bar down there. I like this kind of place once in awhile. It's nice and quaint. Sort of quiet tonight. - You want water, like usual? - With ice and lemon. - OK. - I'll pay you at the end of the month. Who's that guy over there? Never saw him before. Take my drink over there. Mind if I join you? My pleasure. My name is Boris. Boris. You drink quite a bit. But I hold it very well. Boris, what do you think about coming to my place? I have the best Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels. Chinese posters. Tropical butterflies. OK, lets go. Lets go. Yes, yes, lets go... ...go, go, go... Good, good, good... This place looks very nice. Thank you. Like it? The drinks are over there. Serve yourself. Do you have any ice? i don't like warm liquor. For sure. How old are you? How old do you think I am? What a gentlemen. What if I told you... ...I was born in 1757? I would say, you look good for your age. I'm not kidding. Well, you don't look that old. But I am. I am a vampire. A creature of the night? So can you transform into a bat? But no... That's stuff of legends. A little ice please. Are you surprised? Well, I don't... ...meet a vampire everyday. I guess not. But I sense... ...you're afraid, right? I don't know. Now what are you going to do? Bite my neck? No... How could I do that? They say vampires are afraid of the cross. I have one on the night table. Should I get it? If you wish. It's only a superstition. The vampire usually drinks blood. Yes. Yes, we drink blood. A lot of blood. But, a little liquor never hurt anyone. Even a vampire. What if I told you I was a vampire too? Ridiculous... You certainly are not a vampire. You don't know what it means to be a vampire. I used to think about being one... But you are not... I'll tell you what it is like to be one. It's a different galaxy, something not significant... The solar system... Different worlds... ...differnet kinds of people. With different kinds of dreams. It's from there that we came. Our ship crashed over 800 years ago... There were 1,000's of us. Many... Slowly we became fewer... Sickness, genetic mutations... ...and pollution. My mother died when I was born. So, a vampire is not immortal? Stupidity... Our lives... ...expand for a 1,000 to 1,500 years. If nothing fatal happens before then. Vampires in pulp fiction are immune to the blade of a knife. I suppose this is just superstition, no? You're wrong again... My dear... Stab me... They say, vampires... ...are extremely strong creatures... Yes. Yes, we are very strong. Very strong. More then a human being. But, who are you? Only a simple vampire. You see? How could I believe him. His story about coming from the stars. I don't know... Im just an old fashion vampire. I don't know what that guy was full of... But since then I haven't been feeling very good. Maybe I'm just a bit drunk. IS TV BAD FOR THE KIDS? Oresta! Welcome! Where areyou calling from? Rome - A beautiful city. What are you doing? - This afternoon I'm watching your program. Great. So you're in good company. ...so we finished the discussion, lets talk a bit about violence. Sexual violence... Thanks to the public who listens to me with so much joy. Bye... Hello? Sweetheart, it's mommy. How is everything? Good. Everything alright? - Yes. - Have you eaten already? - Yes. - The pasta, the meat and the fruit. So listen, Luisa says hello. Remember her? Eh? And Amadeo? Very good. Daddy says don't watch to much TV. He says shut it off. - With kids? We can do nothing. - And him? He never lifts a finger. What can you do, eh? Us, inside a closet is the answer. What do you mean? The kid? No, the television. But then she picks the lock when we're not there. They say kids watch TV all day and all night. Poor kids. What'll they be when they grow up? - Maybe unemployed. - Michele is skeptical. No... ...I get irritated with this type of discussion. Lots of people don't know how to raise their kids so they blame the TV. So, why look at me? You, for example, should spend more time with Gigio. Look, I spend lots of time with him. - He watches TV anyways. - Then, talk to the kid. Tell him the TV is keeping him from being wth you. Be a father, give him an alternative. Maybe that's why he would rather watch TV. For me... ...children should be treated like adults. Yes of course. We must teach them how to watch TV with intelligence... ...a criteria. They are kids... they always say... But as soon as you turn away, they steal the marmalade. Look at you... your kid watches TV even when you lock it up. Me... ...if my daughter tells me she is in bed I believe her. She's not sneaking any TV OK... so do you think the school should be teaching about sex? This school tries to explain the correct terminology of sex. So, your parents agree? Yes, I got a book on how to have kids. And the book is even good for my parents... ...because it has the correct answers in it. Did you watch Bele Lugosi? 27:23 Yeah, a long time ago. He was on TV in a show about a ghost... - so tall... If you saw it today you'd think it was stupid. I prefer Dr. Jekyll. What are you talking about? - What do you mean? - Pardon me...but... From an artistic view it's better. Forget the artistic stuff. I'm talking about how scary it was. What didn't Dr.Jekyll scare you? No, I never closed my eyes. You must have been a retarded kid. Look who's talking. Mozart here. Call it as you see it. - Which was your favorite? Dr.Jekyll or Bela Lugosi? Did you see them? Do you remember? No, I was to little. I went to bed right after Carosello. but what is Carosello? Welcome to the news of the day. The stories that will be in tomorrows paper. First, let's see... A meeting between 007 and the Big Boss. And now the evening Courier Report. At the end of the edition is a curious case which will cause... ...some bickering among the people. ...Rome had a request delivery She ordered four babies, but three were born...ordered... We don't know why, but one of the babies wasn't delivered... Wake up... Wake up... Momma? Who's there? Is someone here? Momma is it you? Is anyone here? Hey... always with that face... I don't know, why didn't you stay home tonight? Really, would that have been better? Better... Look you'll suffocate that kid of yours. I don't like leaving her alone, it makes me sad. I'm coming to get you. Kid, I'm coming for you... Scream. Aren't you... ...afraid? Next time, if you don't find a babysitter, we won't go out. Be reasonable. The house is locked... I locked up before we left. the wondows are shut tight... We have a doorman, plus the neighbors. Plus an alarm system. No one can get in. NO! Don't! Not the eyes! When I was nine my parents put me in a boat alone... And I went to Civitavecchia by myself... In a boat... alone... I did it. They hoped for the boat to sink... Tomorrow's news... First story... Parents attend a dinner while their child dies. It was sad, painful, but not just for the little girl, ...even for the irresponsible couple. Like many parents, they leave their kids alone... ...with nothing but the TV. It's a tragedy because her death was so unnecessary. Let's concentrate on the death of that little girl. The terrible horror she experienced... The death of poor little Nena... The awful, scary death... What did you do? You broke my TV! Nena, what happened to you? What happened, she broke my TV. Keep your voice down, or you'll wake everyone. What do you mean wake everyone? She broke my TV! Tell mommy what happened to you. Come on... Did you see something that scared you? Tell me mommy what happened. What did you throw? Was it the lamp? She threw the lamp... - Calm down, can't you see she's scared - Oh, my darling, my poor darling... Daddy promised to buy you a Barbie. Now I won't buy it for you... Don't worry about the Barbie. Mommy will buy it for you. The Barbie, mommy will buy it. Don't listen to daddy. And who will buy daddy a new TV? - Mommy will buy you the Barbie. - A new TV, now that this one is broken... You think it will take a month to repair the TV? There's a lot of damage. So then? Then we'll have to buy a new one. A new one? Yes. A new one. And I'm going to miss the soccer championship. How can we afford it? We're still paying for this one. We have to tighten our belts for awhile. We can't live without a TV. Yes, you're right. EMPTY GIF The next time you leave without finishing my office... ...I'll dump you in the shit can for sure.

If you continue working like this, you'll die terribly before you reach the top. The traffic... inky, dinky, oh... The traffic... ink, ink, oh... Martin the problem is the anesthetic and the mask. Or maybe worse, in my vein... I've never ben afraid of any drugs... Imagine... ...in high school... ...they called me the Big Reefer. First of all an anesthetic isn't a drug... Secondly, I've never heard of anyone scared to shit of this kind of operation. What did you say its called? - Espetia Balanica. - I read somewhere the other day... What's this thing called again? - Espetia Balanica. - That's it... Anyway, nothing will go wrong... Snip, snip. Like that? I guess I'll laugh about it with you. Being young is a lucky state. Beautiful. Is this were you come to be intimate? We need to do some clean-up work. I'm referring to the media of course. So... you were looking outside... Did I interrupt you guys? Very well, continue... Phil, a good place to kill yourself. - Hey, listen...- ...how old are you? 29? 31? One time... people like you respected the older generation.

You threw up. - Thanks to you. - But I said excuse me. How could I know you'd be sick. All I see is a case back there. I thought you were that guy from TV. So I made a mistake. No? how can I understand? You're either there or your not. Don't you see me? You're not the only one. Are you always like that? No one can see you? So you're invisible? - Often. - So, some kind of ghost? Still obsessed with your ghosts? No, no, no, whatever. Yeah, I know... But... Would you like to freshen up? It's very cold.

Alisha! - Fast! Get in! - You live here? - Yes. - Not very elegant, but practical. After all that's what you need. A quiet place to hide out. This is safe? - Don't worry. - No one will find you. Certainly. But is there a bath here? I could use a bath. Do you have a stove? - No stove. - How can we live here? Don't worry about it. Let me worry about you. Yeah. Like always. A bit chilly, eh? Where have you been all this time? Here and there. Working in Berlin. Then the wall came down. Poof! Out of work. Now how do you live? - I scramble, working for who pays the most. What the fuck. Are you crazy? What are you doing? Help! What a shame to hear you cry. I can't support you anymore. Brought this from Bulgaria. A very strong drug. Don't worry, you won't feel anything. Turn around. - Why? - Why do you want to kill your brother? Brother? You aren't my brother. Then who am I? The truth is... ...you were adopted as a kid. Lorna, let's go. That's why I could never stand you. Understand! Cut! Battery is running low. I need a fresh one for the special effects. Daniel this scene. - Thank you. - Who the devil are you? I don't think there are enough pieces of this pie. Daniel, she means it. Don't you think? She has a gun, maybe we should go. That's right. Listen to the doll. - Doll! What the fuck! I'm no doll! Jason... super power! Come on, I'm filming. Keep moving. She called me a doll... Are those guys part of the movie? You should have told me... Enough... Enough... Enough, I'm changing my life. Understand? Eh? Understand?! Understand! Fucking jerk! Where is the star of this show? Shit! I don't know why Lorna changed her life. Maybe becasue she was tired of seeing all the blood.
