That's why they say a second wife is the greatest obligation. I can't handle even one wife. Tomorrow, go to the bazaar and get a new aba. - Why an aba (cloak)? - Yours is old.. It's not good for Tehran You're too shy to look at me, but you're good at hanging at the ladies' section. I don't know why, no one lets their daughters marry students of religious sciences. What's your occupation? I study religious sciences. An akhund (mullah)? Mr. Hadj, these clothes suit you. Why don't you wear them all the time? Sometimes it's very lucrative. Gold and Copper A Film by Homayoun Assadian It's cold here, and you don't take care of yourself. Thank you so much. Excuse me, Ms. It's Sepideh. Ms. Sepideh.. Today in the Aname (Quran chapter) session, I saw a girl from our neighborhood. She lost her husband in an accident. No need to worry about me,.. I think about it. I had wanted to talk with you about it. Thank God you bring it up. - Who is it? - Salam alaikom Mr. Hadj. This is your living room? What a cute desk! - Zahra... - By God, if you touch me, I kill myself! Those are beds... You love her, don't you? Zahra Sadat, you want to kill me? Let me die first, then think about your fun! You have a small home... ... but it has a good atmosphere. Do you think I'm a kid? You want to fool me? Now you're a Tehrani student of religious sciences. You are tired? I am tired! You think I'm having a blast? And you just whine! I take you and leave you there. Take a room and study religious sciences, like all normal students! God, why don't you just kill me? I got a day off to go to the (divorce) court. Tala va Mes (Gold and Copper) Film by Homayoun Assadian
