Lieutenant, you were right. He was in the toy store. He bought a stuffed animal. He's on his way to see a new girlfriend. How can you be so sure? I don't have to see her. I know Weaver. She's about 5'7", 5'8", blond... not the platinum kind. She's about 125 pounds. Probably a college graduate. Definitely well-read. Weaver likes to talk, and he wants someone who can talk back. - You see that teddy bear he's carrying? - What about it? Murder comes next. He's in the wooing phase. I spent the last two years of my life one step behind this son of a bitch. He's a piece of shit. Don't you two ever forget it. Look, Lieutenant, this isn't L.A., so just stay cool. Hold up, guys. Coming. Merry Christmas, Laura. Oh, Ryan, he's so cute. Yeah, I thought so too. I'm sorry about not getting it wrapped. - I was in a rush to get it to you. - You didn't have to wrap it. I love it. I love you. Come here. Sit down. You're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. You know that? Give me a kiss. On the floor with your hands behind your back. Give them to me. - Pull him over. - What's going on? Take it easy. Easy. Hello, Weaver. What are you doing? What the hell's the matter with you? He's out of his mind. Come on. Get him on his feet. Come on. Merry Christmas. Hi, Ray. I was expecting Stephen. Mr. Helfet told me to give you this. Where is he? He didn't stay. Thank you, Ray. I'm actually much more concerned about... They're exaggerating. I did not beat him. I restrained him. We don't need a problem. I have enough to deal with. - There'll be no incident on the plane. - That's because you're not going. All right. I'm coming back. You my chaperon? After what happened today, yeah, Lieutenant, I am. "Lieutenant". Is that thanks to me? I'm going back to L.A. I'll be waiting for you on the tarmac. Can't fly back with me? I don't want to wait around. You're always lying. I think honesty would be good for our relationship, don't you? Tell me, how did you plant that evidence in my car? If it were true, what difference would it make? Knowing what you did? You're a cop. How can you look in the mirror? I like what I see. I'm proud I got you off the street. Is it fame? Is that why you screwed me? Did you want to solve a big case before retiring? You got your promotion. Going to write a book? You didn't even make the evening news. See? You watched. This must really burn your ass. You track me down for two years, and you still get no respect? L.A.'s a tough place for a killer. There's a lot of competition. You should've killed a celebrity. I never killed anybody... and you know it. Yeah, right. Wow. Look at this. Somebody really got into the Christmas spirit. It's so pretty. Two crews bet over who could do the best decorations. This was the loser. - You're kidding. - I get all the holiday flights. Come on. Only five passengers, and we get to spend Christmas in L.A. Wait a minute. We may have our hands full. - Yep. It's now 11 passengers. - Ooh, six more. Still a piece of cake. Six men. FAA 2-14. Estimated flight time to L.A. is five hours, 49 minutes. Could get a little bumpy. So, who are these prisoners we're transporting? One of them's a bank robber. The other one is the Lonely Hearts Strangler. Leave it to Uncle Sam to cast a cloud on Christmas. When that happen? I don't know. Move it in, Marty. Let us know when. - Flatten my coat? - I didn't flatten... No. Sit there. I want to sit on the aisle. - I'd like to sit on the aisle. - I should sit on the aisle. Please, don't argue. - Teri... - Don't say you were right all along. - You said I was rushing in London. - No. You know... Look. At least you didn't do what I did... and marry the wrong guy after a five-minute romance. - You did that? - I did it twice. I am just now getting over the need to make men happy. It's pathetic. You have so much time. You have your whole career ahead of you. You know? Really. Just wait for the right guy to come along. Whoa. FAA regulations. Please step off the vehicle. I'll stow it for you. - You live in L.A.? - My dad does. Seats and lavatories clear. We're coming on board now. Merry Christmas. You're four rows down on the left. I need a 28.8 jack immediately after takeoff. Is that a problem? Hey, Captain. You're late. I specifically requested you be here before the other passengers. It was my understanding the flight was almost empty. I'm sorry. I think you'll find everything in order there. Four weapons. That's it? Nothing else? I carry a.38 backup. It's not listed. Most pilots don't mind. I do. It has to ride up front with me. I'm afraid you'll have to hand it over. What are you looking at? Shut up. I want the restraints kept on for the entire flight. We weren't planning on taking them off. - Okay, let's go. - Come on. Don't push me. Come on, Stubbs. Any more verbal abuse and I will gag you. Hi. Excuse me, miss. What's the movie? - It's a Wonderful Life. - Really? What's the name of that song Jimmy Stewart sang with Donna Reed? They were walking down main street. Right here. Middle seat. Sit down. Don't worry about the coat. Sit down. - You really shouldn't do that. - Shouldn't do what? Make eye contact with these guys. You never know what they're up to. What did they do? The guy with the dark hair, the one who likes you... he's a serial killer. - Are you kidding? - He raped and killed five girls. One of the maintenance men told me. Plus, he said that some cops... said that Weaver couldn't have done it. A perfect argument for capital punishment. He doesn't look like a serial killer. Did you ever see what Ted Bundy looked like? He was a real charmer. Mark Harmon played him in the TV movie. What's that? If it's not on the manifest, it's not on the airplane. I swear those guys have seen too many Dirty Harry movies. Checklist. Doors. - Closed. - Cabin preparation? Complete. Call for pushback. This one always sticks. - Seasons greetings from the cockpit. - Oh, my god. We're fortunate to be leaving New York before this latest blizzard hits. We still face a rough ride due to the weather. Flight time is five hours and 49 minutes. It's about 20 minutes longer than usual. The latest Los Angeles weather is overcast skies with rain showers. Welcome aboard. Hello, and welcome aboard. Whenever we fly, wherever we fly, we at Transcontinental... Please note that the no-smoking sign is on. Federal law... And now, please fasten your seat belts. Roger. 321 left Outer Hotel and Zulu. TWA 10-1 1 Trans Con 47 heavy. Flight attendants, please be seated for takeoff. Trans Con 47 heavy. Position on hold... 31, left. I hate these icy takeoffs. On. Checklist is complete. Ready for takeoff. Trans Con 47 heavy. Trans Con 47 rolling. Power's good. We have four stable engines. Trans Con 47, contact departure. Have a good day. Roger. Trans Con 47. Thank you. - I'll flip you for lower business. - That's your section. Normally, but today's not a normal day. Those prisoners give me the creeps. I would've thought you'd take them as a sympathetic gesture. Yeah, well... I'm not as patient as you are. - Heads or tails? - Heads. It'll take your mind off Stephen. Thanks a lot. Something to drink? Heineken. Merry Christmas. Something to drink? Yeah, orange juice, please. What would you like? What do you like? - I'll have the complimentary champagne. - Like hell you will. I'll have a Bloody Mary. Hold the vodka, the celery and the Tabasco. If you wanted tomato juice, why didn't you just say so? - What's your name? - Hey! Teri. I'll have whatever you like, Teri. Apple juice. - That would be great. Thank you. - Make that two. Coke, please. And you'd like? I'd like to nail you. That's two strikes, Stubbs. One more and I will gag you. You got a short fuse, Marshal. It's going to be a long flight. Sorry about that, miss. He won't be bothering you again. Sir? Just bring me a Coke. "Buffalo Gals". The song from It's a Wonderful Life. Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight, come out tonight That was driving me crazy. I dated a criminal once. Only once. He owned a used car lot. They busted him for turning back the odometers. How could you trust someone like that? I figured I did the same thing when I told him I was 21. She's really cute. Yeah, just your type. I know it's meaningless to mention... but a detective planted the evidence that convicted me. You're innocent. Yes, I am. Duly noted. Are you married? Yeah, but I don't wear rings. I don't like jewelry. You don't have to defend yourself to me. Was that a tough sell to your wife? The "I don't like wearing jewelry" bit? Weaver, I know you'd like to entertain yourself... by engaging me in a challenging conversation... but I like to read on a plane. Duly noted. Just fax me that stuff. All right? Just fax me that stuff. All right? Hey, Aldo, I watched Inside Edition last night. How come you weren't on it? Because I was doing Oprah instead. - Oprah. - Didn't you get the message? What message? Hard Copy called. They did? Hines. Yeah? Coffee. Ah, great. You read my mind. And served with such style and grace. Well, that's easy after a zillion miles. Cream and sugar. Skim milk and saccharin. Oh, god. Why do l do this to myself? An old man trying to stay fit in a young world. Hey! You're supposed to stick up for me. I'm just looking at the clouds. We heading into rain? Yeah. Three heavies in front of us reported serious turbulence. We're changing altitude and course to try to vector around it. May put us ten minutes behind schedule, so better let the crew know. That is an easy order on this flight. Good evening, folks. This is Captain Powell. Good evening, folks. This is Captain Powell. Been reports of rough air west of our position. I'm going to leave the seat belt sign off... as we try to steer clear of the weather. However, I recommend that while you are in your seats... keep your seat belts fastened at all times. - Yes? - I'll have the steak, please. Me too. Ten-to-one one of them has a heart attack before we land. What will you have? What do you recommend? The turkey. If that's what you like, then that's what I'll have. You got it... but I'm a vegetarian. Turkey. I'll have the same. What would you like, sir? I got to hit the head. You went before we took off. I got to go again. Let him go in his pants. Come on. He's a human being, not an animal. Turn around and mind your own business. It's your call, Marty, but I say no. Give the man his dignity. That's not right. Damn. Going to behave yourself? What am I going to do with chains on? Don't be soft. Don't tell me what to do, okay? You both go with him, and stay with him. Shit. Come on, man. - Move it. Here, Billy Bob. - All right. Good decision. Shut up. You know, I could go too, Marty. Okay. Let's get this over with. We'll all go before we eat. Come on. I'm already potty-trained. You're going to the bathroom. I don't have to go to the bathroom. No, no. We're going, so you're going. This is getting silly. When it's time for my bodily functions to kick in... you'll be the second to know. We disturb the passengers every time we do this, so we do it now. What passengers? I'm not going to tell you again. Now let's go. That was the captain's seat belt warning. You must go back to your seats. We're not done here. From what I can see, nobody has to do anything. The seat belt light is on. You all have to sit down. You heard her. Let's go. We have to get back to our seats. Be right out. - Come on. - I'm washing my hands. This is Captain Powell. We can expect a rough ride for the next 15 minutes. I've turned on the seat belt sign. Please return to your seats... and fasten your seat belts. What are you doing? Hillbilly Bob. Sir, you're going to have to take your seats now. Arquette, what's going on? Let's zip it up. Al? - What is it, Marty? - Stay where you are, Mike. What's that? Everybody, down! Don't get any ideas. The seat belt sign is still on. Let him go. Back off. You do what I tell you, or I'll kill him. Do it and die. I'm dead already. Let him go. - I'm sorry. - This is really touching. You boys want to hug each other? Boo. Now, let's get it. I'm going to check it out. Get back! Oh, my god! Bastard. Cleveland, this is Trans Con 47 heavy. We are declaring an emergency. Losing cabin pressure. We'd like to descend immediately. Stand back! We have crossing traffic directly below you. Maintain your altitude. Flight attendant to flight deck, please! Verify your cabin pressure if possible. Autopilot flight selected. Disengage. - Autopilot... - Disengage. Cabin pressure. Cleveland. Say your altitude. Autopilot engaged. - Watch it! - Easy! Oh, god! Drop your gun! Oh, Marshal Dillon, you throw down your gun. You drop it, or I do her. Stubbs, let her go. Don't get involved! Let her go. Why? Because she gave you fucking apple juice? You put a bullet through her head, by the time it comes out the other side... you're going to have five in you. Is she okay? - You all right? - Yes. Bullshit. He won't shoot. He goes to the pistol range five times a month... and practices on cardboard versions of you for the hell of it. Look at his face. He wants to take you out. Let her go. We need a hostage. Wake up. We have a dozen hostages already. We have the upper hand. Don't do anything stupid and give it back. Take it easy. Got it? - Give me your gun. - No. Get him to drop his. Stubbs may be a moron, but he's a professional. He won't let her go until you're disarmed. - I'm not giving you my gun. - Why not? I already have one. I just didn't show it off like an idiot. We have enough idiots onboard already. You okay? You sure? You lost, Douglas. I'll take that, cowboy. - See, I am a professional. - Stubbs, listen... Not so tough now, are ya? Look at me! Let's have us a little skydiving exhibition. - What are you doing? - This motherfucker's getting out! - You can't open the door! - Shut up! Don't touch that door! Shut up. Okay, asshole, open the door and say "Geronimo"! All right, you can say "Crazy Horse". Just open the fucking door. No, she's telling you the truth... One, two, three! Shit. Carl, get the key. Betty, follow me. We'll notify the pilot. Teri, get a pulse. - He's still breathing. - Okay, he's alive. Get a blanket. - We've got to get this open. - What's the procedure here? - We've got to get this open. - What's the procedure here? An emergency landing. - I'll go to the flight deck. - I'll go. - You can't go. You're not in charge. - Just save this man's life. - You're trained for this. I'm not. - Carl, go with him. Give me the key to the cockpit. Come on. Could you help me with my wife? Please? Please? - Betty, get some water, please. - Maybe some more blankets. American National 890, Cleveland Center. We've lost radio control with Trans Con 47. He's at your 5 o'clock, 15 miles opposite direction, 2000 above you. Could you relay to him to contact Indy Center now on 128.3? He's in distress. American National 890. Roger, Cleveland. That's Indy Center on 128.3. Cleveland Center, American National 890. No reply from Trans Con 47. Do you have another frequency you want us to try? Negative, American National 890. Thanks for your help. This is Trans Con 47 heavy. This is Trans Con 47 heavy. We are declaring an emergency. Would like to descend immediately. We've lost all communication with Trans Con 47. The plane took a steep dive, but has since leveled off and seems steady. - It's off the airway... - We've got a major storm ahead. We've located the plane. It's on autopilot. If it continues its present heading... All right, notify the FAA and get me the FBI. Marcy, priority call. Go and check. How is he? Oh, God. This is bad. What did Ted say? He bumped his head pretty bad, but he's okay. He's got clearance. We'll be on the ground in about 20 minutes. Jesus God. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. It's a wonderful life. When we land, what happens then? I'll be transferred back to death row... and I'll wait in my little cell until however long it takes. Have you ever been married, Teri? I was engaged. "Was engaged"? He broke it off. I always wanted to be married, have a family... a kid. I always wanted a son. I don't know why I always do this to myself. Did you do what they say you did? No. I never killed anyone. Because what you did up here is save lives... my life. That's not going to mean anything down there. They'll think I orchestrated the whole thing. It will matter. You don't know the guy that framed me. Who's that? They give you a last meal, but I'm gonna ask for a last song. Maybe the beat in my head will distract me... when they stick the needle in my arm and watch me die. We're not descending. Maybe he hasn't found a good spot yet. I'm gonna go check. I'll be back down. Okay. Trans Con 47, do you read? Please acknowledge on emergency frequency 133.75 megahertz. Trans Con 47 heavy, from company CMC... we're assuming lost communication. If you read, squawk ident. Shit. Ted? Trans Con 47, if you read, acknowledge... on emergency frequency I repeat, 133.75. Trans Con 47, if you copy, please acknowledge. Bingo! Someone just flashed his ident. Okay, Trans Con 47, we got you. We copy your ident. Please contact on emergency frequency 133.75. I repeat, 133.75. What's the status on those two prisoners? Trans Con 47, if you can hear me, squawk ident. - Are you positive? - I saw it clear as day! Someone hit that switch. Maybe it wasn't one of the pilots. Then who's flying the goddamn plane? - The plane is on autopilot. - Maybe they're trying to communicate. Maybe they can hear the broadcast and haven't figured out how to respond. We need an instructor pilot. I need a 747 200 right now... less than 500 miles radius from that Trans Con. Tower Air 91, CMC. Tower Air 91, CMC. Captain Bowen, you're now linked for relay on 133.75. We'll be standing by. Trans Con 47, this is Tower 91 on Trans Con crisis request. If anyone can hear me, press the "ident" button on the far right of the console. Repeat. Find the "ident" button... on the far right side, about halfway up, and press it. Trans Con 47, we got you. We copy your ident. Well done, Tower 91. Roger, CMC. Good show, Trans Con 47. Now find the VHF tuning panel on the middle left side of the console. It has two small frequency windows marked "active" and "standby". The active frequency should read 133.75... in green numbers. Four inches below that is a small switch marked "R-stroke-T INT". That's your transmit switch. Whoever you are, position your boom mike in front of your mouth. When I tell you, push the R/T switch forward, say your name... then let go of that switch to listen. Do it now. My name is Teri. Teri Halloran. Pleased to meet you, Teri. Captain Samuel Bowen here. Remember, when you need to speak, push the R/T switch up... hold it there, talk, then release it. - You got that? - Got it. Trans Con 47... this is Rachel Taper, Trans Con Crisis Management Center. Are you a passenger? I'm a flight attendant. My employee number is... We don't need that right now. - What is your flight crew's status? - Dead. One of the prisoners escaped. There was a shoot-out. All the marshals are dead. It's a mess. What do I do? This is Frank Sinclair, FBI. Who is actually flying the aircraft? Nobody. I'm up here all alone. Where is the cabin crew? Below with the other prisoner, Ryan Weaver. - Oh, God. - Keep her calm. Is this plane going to crash? No, it's not. How do you know? Because we're monitoring your flight systems... on the central maintenance computer. But isn't there a storm ahead? Don't we have to land? Teri, you've got to stay calm. The most important thing for you to do is stay calm. Okay. I'm calm. Now what? Whatever you do, don't touch the autopilot switch. I won't. The good news is... you're flying the most sophisticated plane ever built. Great. But what if this "sophisticated plane"... flies into an unsophisticated storm? I hear you, Teri. This plane has a great track record. Patch me through to the Department of Defense. Teri, we need you to stay calm. Yeah. Calm. That's me. Aldo, I gotta ask a question. Internal Affairs is asking everybody if we think you planted the evidence. - What did you say? - "No". I'd never tell them anything. We're partners. But I'm curious. Did you plant the teddy bear in Weaver's car? Yes. Hey, Hines! You got a telephone call! Sure. Right after lunch! Somebody at the Crisis Control Center at LAX about Weaver! Holy shit. CMC to Trans Con 47 heavy, flight level 350... tracking 245 degrees. Approaching area of severe weather at her 12 o'clock, 200 miles. At her present ground speed, she will enter the weather in 2-3 miles. I'd like you with the others. We're heading into a storm. And I'd like to hold on to the gun. You don't like me. We were seated in your section, but you made Teri wait on us. Didn't you? I thought it would distract her from her problems. What problems? She ended a relationship recently. Very smart. You didn't lie to me. You can tell I know when somebody's lying, can't you? Can't you, Maggie? You're sharp. I noticed that. When? When did you notice it? Say it. Don't be afraid. When? Say it. When... you persuaded the agent to let the other prisoner use the bathroom. You hoped something might develop. Come on. Everybody back into the crew bunk, please. - What? - Everybody back into the crew bunk. Round them up. Let's go. Come on! Everybody back to the crew cabin. Open the door, Maggie. Go open the door. Excuse me. We can't all fit in here! - Just keep moving. - Why don't you do something? You're the man. Get up the stairs. - Okay. All right. - Get up! Move. Give me the key. Those people didn't hurt you. Why hurt them? What's your favorite book? I read Stephen King. - You're alone a lot, aren't you? - What? Men don't look at you anymore, not the ones you want. Your plumbing's getting rusty. What's left for you? Go for it. But then what? Can you kill? I started with squirrels and birds and moved on to cats and girls. If you can kill me, go ahead. Where's Teri? You should be concerned with yourself. Oh, God. No! I don't like you either, Maggie. You rub me the wrong way. Get in! Teri, we need to get you up to speed... on the operation of the auto flight system... specifically how to use the autopilot... before we can begin to discuss your descent. Discuss my what? This is Rachel Taper again. Listen to me carefully. We think you can land this plane if Capt. Bowen can talk you through it. I'm gonna get the senior flight attendant. Teri, no. Stay where you are. Why? You need to program the autopilot... to vector you around the storm. It's a level six storm. A six on a scale from one to ten? No, Teri. On a scale of one to six. I'm going to get Maggie. - She'll handle this better than me. - Stay where you are. Do not leave the flight deck. We have to stay in contact. I'm hanging. We show Trans Con 47 tracking jet airway 60. She's maintaining her preprogrammed flight path. Yeah, Los Angeles Police Department, please. - Is this an emergency? - Yes, ma'am. Rampart division. - Lieutenant, I have a call for you. - I'll take it. - Hines. - Don't you mean Lt. Hines? How are you, Aldo? - What's going on up there? - It wasn't pretty. The other prisoner killed the four marshals... and I came in, saved the day and took care of him. - I heard you. - You don't believe me? Where's the pilot? They're dead. Both of them. So who's in charge up here? Me. - L.A.P.D. - Come on through, sir. All right, Ryan, you want... Whoa! "Ryan"? Now I'm Ryan, not Weaver? Well, that's an improvement. You want to negotiate? No. I don't. I'm going to crash the plane. If you land, we can talk. Listen to me. Both pilots are dead. There's nobody flying this plane. It's not gonna land. And what would you like to talk about, Hines? You wanna talk about getting me a new trial? You wanna talk about admitting you planted that evidence on me? Maybe you'd like to talk to the FBI. Fuck the FBI! I'm talking to you. Where are you? Get this call on the loudspeaker. - L.A.X. - L.A.X. That's perfect. Are you the authority on me now? Tell 'em what I'm gonna do next. - What are you gonna do? - You're not listening. You're not listening to me! You don't wanna talk to me? Fine. I'm not talking to anybody, 'cause this plane isn't coming down! I'm 35000 feet up with no pilot! Even if I did get down, what would I have to look forward to? You'd have 20 guns on me. You'd bring me back to prison to await my execution! I'm smarter than that and I'm smarter than you! But we all know that... 'cause you cops can't do anything without cheating and without beating! Well, we caught you. No! How did you get me? I'm up here and you're down there. How did you get me? - Calm down. - No! I'm mad now! I'm gonna take it out on somebody, and her blood will be on your hands. You got that? You wanna be famous, Aldo? I'm gonna make you so famous! Wear something bright on that tarmac... 'cause you're gonna be the first cop to die with a plane up his ass! This is Trans Con 47. Are you still there? Yes, Teri, we're here. Give us a minute, okay? Fuck! Open the door. Teri, open the door! Maggie's hurt! He's at the flight deck. - What? - She bashed her head. She's bleeding. She keeps calling for you. Teri, can you hear me? - You've got to change your course. - Teri! He's right outside. He says a flight attendant is hurt. At least give me the first aid kit. It's next to the bunk. Teri, this is Lt. Hines. She needs you! I arrested Weaver. Do not trust him. Help me, Teri! Why didn't you tell me the copilot was dead? He died? You knew he was dead. He was breathing when I put him into the bunk. Oh, shit. I did everything I could. This is bad! Whatever you do... do not open the door. Remember downstairs when you asked me what was the matter? I was trying to find a way to tell you how bad it was. Oh, God. - You told me we were landing. - I didn't know what to say! Okay. I didn't know what to say. I'm sorry. We'd been through so much... You must program the autopilot. Teri? I'm sorry I lied to you. Capt. Bowen needs you to know them to be able to help you. Maggie's hurt. I'll do everything I can. I don't know what to do, though. - She keeps calling for you. - Teri, are you there? She's your friend. - Let her bleed. - He says Maggie's hurt bad. I don't care how charming you think he is. He's a killer. - But she is my friend. - All right, listen. You could both be in danger. Get her to the flight deck, but stay together. You understand me? Teri? Are you there? Maggie? Please stop. Trans Con 47, this is CMC. This is Trans Con Crisis Management Center. Please respond. What's the FAA procedure for this situation? There's never been a situation quite like this. It's got enough fuel to carry it beyond our coastline. If we were handling this, fewer lives would be in jeopardy. - Meaning what? - Just what I said. Here's who you're dealing with: male Caucasian, 35, well-educated. Raised by his aunt who mysteriously disappeared when he was 16. Has raped and strangled five women... escaped while being transferred to San Quentin two years ago... finally recaptured and was being transported by four of your marshals... We already have a comprehensive profile... Let's focus on the problem with the plane. We can't just let it crash into Downtown Los Angeles. There's a level six storm ahead. Everything else could be a moot point in eight minutes. Miss! Will this storm delay our flight? Going to be late for the gate. This is something. It doesn't look too good. Where is everybody? - What? - Where is everybody? You know, I was kind of wondering that myself. They just disappeared. It's kind of creepy, isn't it? - Why don't you sit down. - Why? Or stand, if you want. I don't like guns. Let me ask you something. What's your favorite movie? What's my favorite movie? Look, don't answer a question with a question. Only stupid people do that... and you're obviously a very bright woman. Now, what's your favorite movie? Gone With the Wind. - What's your favorite book? - Is this a test? That's a question with a question, Teri. Come on. I just want to talk with you. What's your favorite book? Gone With the Wind. So it's the book and movie. You're a real romantic, huh? A romantic vegetarian who likes apple juice. Did you have pets when you were growing up? I had a dachshund. Dachshund? You mean one of those "hot dog" dogs? Really? Why a dachshund? Because my father liked them and they were good with kids. Don't give me an attitude. We're just talking. So just talk to me normal. A guy can't even have a conversation these days. - Did you like your father? - Why? - We got along great. - Really? Is he still alive? Are you parents alive? - Yeah. - Oh, good. Mine aren't. Here's a good one. You're a condemned inmate... on Death Row awaiting your execution. What five albums would you pick? What would you want to listen to? Or just pick a song. I wouldn't be in the mood for music. You wouldn't know what the fuck you'd be in the mood for. What would you spend your last moments doing? I guess I'd see my family and my friends. And what if they couldn't be here? Then I'd want to make it right with God. - What if you didn't believe in God? - I do believe in God. You do? Do you believe in capital punishment... what they're going to do to me? You wouldn't, though, would you? - What does that mean? - That's not who you are. You're sweet. Dachshunds, Gone With the Wind. There's always hope, isn't there? What about sex? Would you want to have sex on your last day? I'm not saying, because that's too personal. So is murder. - Where's Maggie? - Don't get adversarial with me. You don't want to do that. Now, talk to me, Teri. I haven't had many partners. Don't lie to me. How old were you when you first had sex? Eighteen and a half. Did you like it? Yeah. - Was that hard? - No. Just simple little questions. Don't get upset. Everything's fine. Here. Merry Christmas. Maggie's in the bathroom. - In the bathroom? - Maggie's in the bathroom. Must be the other one. Hey, come here. Dashing through the snow Laughing all the way Come here! Teri, come on! Hold the oxygen mask firmly against your face. Place the strap around your head. Teri, can you hear me? Controller break. Isn't this stuff fucking amazing or what? Teri, you are one exciting first date. Are you all right? Hold on! You're not having much luck with men lately, are you? - Please, I'll do anything you say... - I don't want to land. Got it? What about everybody else? You've got them somewhere. I don't want to talk about them. I really like you, Teri. Then help me land the plane. Listen to me! Listen! Let's enjoy our time together now. Maybe we'll make it halfway to Hawaii before we go down. Wouldn't that be romantic? - Wouldn't it? - No. That would be a turnoff. Well, I didn't like Gone With the Wind. It's all subjective. You don't have to force yourself on me. You can have me.... if you help me land the plane and let everybody live. So I spare everyone... and you give me a bigger bang than the one I get from crashing the plane? Yeah. Do we have a deal? You want me? Come on. You see? Right here. This is what it's all about. It's the thrill of the kill for me, just like the passengers. I killed them all. Go to the crew cabin. They're all dead. It's beautiful. Go look. It's time. Teri. Trans Con Crisis. Please respond. CMC to Trans Con 47. Come in, please. Again, Trans Con Crisis, trying to reach Trans Con 47. If you read us, please come in. Teri, this is Trans Con Crisis Management Center. Please respond. I'm back. He wants to crash the plane and go out in a blaze of glory. He's crazy. He killed Maggie. I think he killed everybody. Do you have a weapon? Is there anything you can defend yourself with? No, but he's going to kill me. That's what he wants. Lock the door. Barricade it. Get that fighter airborne. We'll have to shoot it down before it reaches Los Angeles. What? You can't shoot a commercial airliner. She said he wants to crash the plane into LAX. Do we have any other option? Our equipment shows you're leaving the west edge of the weather. We'll prepare you for the approach... and descent now. Your controls need your immediate attention and execution. We're okay here. The aircraft is doing fine, and so are you. Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight - Are you with me, Teri? - Come out tonight Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight Dance by the light of the moon Teri, what's happening? Who said this was a non-smoking flight? Honey! Is everything okay? Honey! - Come out! - Teri, F.B.I. Are you there? Come on. Come out! Oh, my god. She's got a fire. She's got a fire. It's on the computer. You got a fire on the upper deck. Can you confirm? Come on. Can you confirm the fire? Please respond. Trans Con 47, do you have a fire? Teri, do you read me? Stay out of the cockpit! You hear me? Come on! Get downstairs! - Get out of my way! - Douglas's gun. Now I'm scared. Do you have it in you to kill me? Don't wound me. Shoot me in the head or the heart. Come on. Shoot me! Come on. Kill me. Give me the gun. This is how you do it. Goddamn it! Fuck! Bitch! Now get downstairs! Come on. Move! Oh, shit! Oh, you bitch! CMC, Trans Con 47, you got to talk to me. CMC, Trans Con 47, you got to talk to me. Excellent. Captain Bowen's down and standing by. Okay, I'm going to turn you over to Captain Bowen. Keep that F-14 on their tail. That's it. I'm never flying this airline again. Captain Bowen, you are uplinked to Trans Con 47. Go ahead. Are you ready to come down? Absolutely. Okay. We're going to land, using the autopilot. It's below the glare shield. It says: "A stroke T, ARM, IAS stroke MACH". - Got it. - Good. To the right of your knee you'll see a small TV screen... with buttons on either side. That's the CDU display. We'll use that to input data into the flight computers. What does it say now? "Forty-seven progress" and a lot of other stuff. Excellent. We're going to be landing on runway 25, left. Come on. This is the one good thing you taught me, Dad. That fucking bitch. Press the button marked "depart/arrive". It's in the top row in the middle below the screen. That'll give you the arrivals for LAX. Push the button to the right of "KLAX arrival". Now push the button beside "25, left". Then push the button marked "execute". - Done! - Very good, Teri. Now we've got to get you lined up for LAX. Come on. Come on, son. I'm a genius! Oh, come on, genius. That's it. Okay. Oh, my leg. On the screen do you see a list of words? Those words are navigation points... that define your path to the airport. - When you push the top left button... - Can you talk any faster? Right. Push the top left button, then the button marked "execute". The plane will turn to line up for landing. Done! Tower Air from Los Angeles flight tracking. We show her turning left, heading for runway 25, left. Any sign of Weaver? Not yet. We're doing splendidly. Time to drop the landing gear. This bit's noisy. Forward center panel, right of center screen... the handle with the wheel at the end. Pull it towards you and push it down until it locks. How long 'til we start our descent? We'll begin it now. The autopilots will do the landing, but you'll have to set them up. Find the switches labeled "left", "center", and "right"... and push the two that are not lit. AUTOPILOT ENGAGE Hand on the speed brake handle next to your right knee. Pull it up and back just a hair. - Have you done that? - Got it. Above you on the overhead panel, see the landing lights? Turn them all on. There's seven minutes to touchdown. Leave her alone. She'll do the rest by herself. You're just 20 miles out. Everything's looking rosy. I need a volunteer for a dangerous mission. You, you, you. Okay, you. Okay, you can stay. - Sir, did you see that? - I saw it. We believe Weaver's gained access to the avionics bay. What's the matter? He's in the avionics bay, screwing with the plane's circuitry. What's the worst that can happen? Disable the autopilot. And then what? Did you wear something bright? Hold on. You still there? Listen to me. After you got me mad, I killed the crew and the passengers. You better get to confession. The next sound you hear will be me taking out the autopilot. See you soon. Weaver, no! Autopilot disengaged. What happened? I'm falling! Help me! You have to abort. Repeat: Abort. Find two switches on the floor, number two and three thrust makers. Push them twice. Repeat: Find the two switches on the thrust makers. - I can't find them! - Yes, you can! LAX She's going to slam into the Crown Plaza. If she clears that, she'll hit the parking garage. I got them! Well done, Teri. What the f... Damn it! 'Tis the season to be jolly Deck the halls with boughs of holly Oh, my god! Oh, my god! She cleared the buildings. Just one problem. I think it's a Ford. The autopilot backup circuits should've cycled by now. Reengage autopilot switches. Autopilot engaged. CMC, flight tracking. She's losing altitude. The truck's dragging her down. You're stalling. Pull up the landing gear. She can't. There's a fucking truck caught on it. Forget the landing gear. Do not touch the landing gear. Push the thrust levers forward. Oh, my god! CMC, flight tracking. She's 300 feet and climbing out. Patch me through to that F-14. - Bring her back and try again. - Wait a minute! You've got a 747, beat to hell by turbulence... a dead flight crew... an armed serial killer loose onboard... eight passengers missing and a stewardess locked in the cockpit. - Have I left anything out? - Don't forget about the truck. What's happening? Shouldn't I turn around? CMC, flight tracking from Moondog. I'm alongside her at 9:00. In tight. Distance: 200 feet. Speed to match. - Roger. Hold your position. - What's that plane doing there? It's there in case you need assistance. How could it assist me? It's just a precaution. Don't worry about it. Fuck precaution and fuck you. First. God, she's turning it around. God, she's turning it around. How can she turn it around? She's only a stewardess. She's a flight attendant. CMC, Moondog. Trans Con 47 coming left. Moondog maintaining position. Okay, now listen up, everyone. I'm coming back into L.A. with or without you. You got two choices here. You can either help me land or prepare for one major crash. Notify the Department of Defense. This is it. Wing Commander, this is Special Agent Sinclair. Arm your weapons. Prepare to fire. I repeat: Arm weapons and prepare to fire. Roger. Breaking left to rejoin. The pilot that was outside my flight deck window? I don't know if you can hear me. I think you can. I hope you can. If you're supposed to stop this plane... I just hope you'll give me another chance. Target's in sight. Just one more chance to show you I can get this thing down. Look, I know it's only one life up here... against who knows how many if we crash... but I can make this happen. Just give me another chance. Weapons systems are armed and ready. Standing by for further instructions. That's all I want for Christmas. It's all I want forever. CMC from Moondog. Reconfirm intent to fire. You listen to me, son. None of us wants to splash that plane... but bringing her back in would be risking thousands of lives. Fire. That's an order. My commander's going to have to authorize that. Target's approaching a populated area where debris could hit the ground. That's why it's important you don't waste time. Fire. Say your prayers. Moondog, this is Commander Rice. Fire. That's an order. Fire! Come on, asshole! Get up! I dare you! You got to love her. Oh, god! You're not going to kill me. You can't kill me, 'cause you don't believe in capital punishment. I changed my mind. Trans Con 47, your excess baggage has been claimed. You're clear to land. Oh, perfect. - Rachel. - I hear you, Teri. Weaver is dead. Copy that? - I hear you. - Can Captain Bowen hear me? I'm with you, Teri. - Tell me what to do. - Find that arrival switch. - Push it. - I pushed it. Push the button beside runway seven, right... and then execute. LAX arrivals up. What next? Find those switches labeled "L-NAV" and "V-NAV". Push them. To the left is the airspeed control knob. Dial in a speed of 180. Done. - Speed brakes armed? - Armed. Reduce speed to 156. All right, Teri. You're locked onto the glide scope. The plane should land itself now. Whatever happens, don't touch the controls. Got it. CMC, flight tracking. She's intercepted seven right... slowing to 160 knots. Everything's looking good. All right! I'm down! Set the parking brake, please. Merry Christmas, everyone! Red Leader to team three. We've located Halloran. She may know where the hostages are. We're en route. All clear here. Miss Halloran, I'm Lieutenant Hines. You'd make a hell of a cop. No, thanks. - Merry Christmas. - You, too. Captain Bowen. Captain Halloran. Translation: dima360 [notabenoid.com]
