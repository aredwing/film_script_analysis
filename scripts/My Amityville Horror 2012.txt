psychologist I have connects with many people in so many different situations that I'm much much many enter and I never okay always respectful what people's life experiences have been is there someone that you're hoping to benefit from from doing most I would have to say my children ok I want you can't 1917 hard tough have a spoken to you at all about it yes have and and and they are concerned that's you know someday I get past you feel like you have you haven't I'm ready to not something that I asked for I didn't achieve this it's not an accomplishment in my life so wish to be associated have anything this has been following my entire life I've been running away from and it finally caught up to me and I couldn't hide ok i sat down with my mom and I told her I said I I have to go I left and went to go find my own place in the world I didn't want to you know be the Amityville Horror kid everywhere that I know people have preconceived notions me I didn't want to deal with it so I would just Wanderley find places where nobody you mean tryin work my way into a community alright well I was born Daniel Edward quarantine on in 1965 in West Balam Long Island New York my father and my mother were high school sweethearts on like one of those from back see incidences they were married very young very family oriented you know the the family's only lived a couple blocks away from each other it was my world and which what I know and my mom and dad got divorced I don't know I guess I was 7 and a halfish when the divorce was actually final and dad moved out on with his life and and we're not gonna Grandma and Grandpa's on Sunday anymore there was this period of time where I really didn't know where I fit in anymore what to do with myself it helped me get closer with my mother did actually strengthened our relationship I had assumed a lot of no responsibilities you know I was watchin my brother and my sister and was responsible for the house and then george was introduced into this yeah I which a a there was maybe year for some you know my mom went out with a couple guys burnt she like George george was an ex-marine recently divorced on a house had a carry permit had shoppers and family business and bolts Corvettes and you know you was very well to do guy somewhere along the line after my mother had met George between georgian my father there was in agreements you would met only marry my mother if you get it legally adopted three kids with the name change in the Social Security and birth certificates and yeah he was gonna put his name in label on something that wasn't ultimately his you know that's when I just started destroying disguise world every opportunity that I walked into just do anything to get him that we could go back all let's put it this way I don't think it was the Brady Bunch I was somebody that at the time for a couple of years they became familiar with but I actually saw these kids and interacted with them in their home I was just I was sorta a presence when I was there I certainly wasn't harmful to them so I don't really think that they were relating to me as a reporter they certainly knew how I came to know caffeine George I i think that there was some natural tension there because this was us it was stepfather Danny was was naturally more taciturn more self-contained but he was always watching he was always very very aware of what was going on just as I was putting together a series on different aspects of psychic phenomenon for the station Channel 5 News the story about the Lutz's and their experience in 112 Ocean Avenue word the Amityville Horror houses it's now come to be known broke in New York Newsday everyone was trying to get in touch with them and it took me a couple of weeks nobody knew where they were once they had done a press conference they basically went underground I finally managed to leave messages for them in track them down and George Lutz called me and asked me if I would come and meet with them because I told them I have good contacts in the field parapsychology so I did go out and meet with George Lutz and his family on surveying firm at the time we had a nice conversation he took me back to his mother in laws house to meet cathy his wife and the three kids that's where they were staying and over the course of a five-hour conversation where they told me about their story they decided that I was someone that they could trust in that they would allow channel 5 tap the exclusive on the story so that's how it all started on November 13th 1974 the house at 112 Ocean Avenue Amityville became the site of a notorious mass murder 23-year-old Ronald to fail junior shot to death his father mother two brothers and two sisters with a 35 caliber Marlin rifle all six victims were discovered by police face-down in their beds apparently unmoved and each murdered while sleeping good toxicology reports approved the family was not thread no silencer had been used on the weapon lingering questions surrounding these murders have remained for nearly forty years giving way to wild conspiracy theories on whether or not to fail could have committed these crimes alone well at first just moving into the house was fine it's a lovely house and we enjoyed moving within a week cathy's handed untouched by something that we discussed couldn't explain it was just something unseen bills or to fly said here to and Matt coming times cal green the lots family purchased the house at the reduced prices eighty thousand dollars very shortly after moving in the family claim to have begun experiencing mounting paranormal phenomena cold spots were discovered randomly throughout the house georgian Kathy claim to have witnessed to red eyes peering in at them from the upstairs bedroom window jolting sounds with wake the family during the night my son Danny hands work on in the window in the sewing room and they were flat and is in just slammed I was was most in such a way that his hands were actually to form they were flat thing going downstairs and found a calming down is pretty much impossible gonna we've and look at it and then is fine it didn't occur to us until much later that house never really wanted us to leave the family fled the house on january 14 1976 none the subsequent families who have lived in the house since have reported anything usual people we talked to seem to feel that whatever was the motive for this crime it had something to do with the family it's not something that's going to return to bother anyone else it will be interesting to see what Danny feels after all these years what's also I think fascinating is how much love what he remembers actually happened and how much in does he think what happened I knew the child I don't know the man and yet Amityville is a thread and actually something that has defined he and his siblings for their lives so I'd like to know how is it impacting you wanna see if he's come to terms with that this he feels this is Israel she do you mean good what you been up to for the last thirty years been hanging in here for a while ok said last time I saw you you are helping your mother do dishes in the kitchen at the San Diego house you came to San you yes one other things about the lots is that struck me immediately was they were not seeking publicity they were very very normal they were young suburban couple the three kids were very very nice if you know any better they were just like the couple next door I mean when you heard the story it sounded like they had been visited by just about every form a Paris psychological play in existence I offered to put them in touch with Paris psychologist like marine Warren they accepted that and basically at that point they said okay now on anything we do you can have the exclusive there are only two conditions one you could you don't go into the house by yourself you go in with reputable Paris psychologist you know be great if you can get it whole team up our psychologist in there so everybody to do their thing and read the house 0 what was ever in their to we wanted our Privacy respect is what they asked me and they definitely wanted the kids kept down a bit the family's privacy and you reporting love yes okay com like we would we're gonna go to your schools and take pictures start interviewing you anything Danny oh I wish somebody would have what happened well but you are a minor child and don't forget this very good at speaking for myself what would you have said if you could have spoken for yourself are spread all told everything that happened exactly the way it happened while it is fresh in my mind as you can possibly be now it's an interesting statement I mean how fresh or dim is it your mind now solve their I wish I could get were us said something that has been in my dreams tire life Harry was going through episode while the garage was on the possession outcall yeah job was going holistic and torches to keep on a leash in pair but it was just long enough for him to jump over the fence for I went out there to try to get from whose fighting so much I was fairly strong enough to rolled back over the fence but that seems me has been a reoccurring dream probably five hundred time whatever life sometimes I would be Harry sometimes Harry would be me sometimes I tried to kill him sometimes he tried to kill me times there was nothing wrong with the garage other times I thought I knew what was wrong the garage I mean I wasn't there for a while again it's never about dreams about the emotions fled it's kind of hard for me to explain to some people I would like to think that find a guide Arctic trying to explain gap which I don't I could just bring up I had no knowledge of murder news I did you know it anything about it day we showed up to a good mom or a ticket house its wash shield page wheaties see it is that your going and still talk wanna stay and their will mom leans into the car is watch guys old family that was murdered here with and that very same its asked us she thought that ball Ross Christmas just kinda liked looking at everything what was my reaction Street I don't know that he had so people murdered seven-years-old really know what a murderous what do you recall when you first moved into the house that I thought I could like it here I thought that the doc was gonna be my hang out on the boat house and you know I I was really anxious and looking forward to to be I figured it was big enough to keep George do away from me and everybody had enough room in you know this is this is pretty cool I could work with us moving and a we go a this was a self move this was the family pack to drop factor on boxes if it breaks it's your fault cuz you look back box right by the time we've got Amityville was mid-morning an 11 something like that my job was was just to to haul boxes that said I helped back to drop in on one pack drop and I ran down to the bone yard and ran up to the top 10 couldn't believe this is like on the water with Paul kids in the pool boat house in I got right inside the front door and i'm looking at this picture right here where you can see straight up the staircase ran all the way up to see how far the house would call when slight literally twice as big as anything else we had looked at I loved it thought it was great soldier move I'll maybe a quarter of the way into the truck father ratios up but I song come n I was in the truck dump on boxes of at that point a I wanted to know which was my room cuz I wanted father rate to come to my room to good also my wrong so did your mom just call him over to left the house lot of people will do that that's just a normal occurrence so when did you start really feeling that a sense about ease okay the until the first two hours being in the house I mean I was confused with the whole father Ray in areas and he's getting this holy water in the Far Niente page in the Bible he went in the house around a good boxes at dropped in you're talking with my mom and and I go back down get another box but I'm afraid he's gone well had you met you had met I didn't even speak tool mom what if I the rain leaf what's going on and she said I don't know but played you know he'll be back I will see him on Sunday subsequently the next box was to go up to the playroom and when I went in there there was problem she for a five hundred flies and we're talking this is made December Long Island yeah I started gallon mom came running up stairs and she stopped screaming nervous it finally started clicking in her mind I'm not sure what it was why father Ray just left I would stand there with the newspaper smashing them on the wall and smashing them on the window and knowing that in five minutes I just killed about a hundred flies I went downstairs tell Mom to have a calm of to be all proud skilled flies and the dead flies are gone she would look at me and say but did you do you did what where's the newspaper puts and I just left a newspaper on the floor was too dead flies and that's when my confusion started when did you start feeling sensing any unease or what was the offer and my mother was is it would could not she was able to describe anything if I walked in I said mom what strong she would tell me immediately what's going on and she wouldn't keep things from I'll and now she's keeping secrets from and I those mom I told we had disagreements here and she which given me these bullshit excuses or not answering passing of that I wanna know what's going on the housing to react differently or people reacted differently to the house your mother said she had a feeling love peace and didn't even want to go out to do normal chores and things george always said he couldn't get warm and he was admitted to becoming more aggressive and then om one of the things that they there's a whole list of things that they told me about that I'm put bullet points here there was subtle personality changes in all the family members basically that olive you were affected you had very short tempers violence was commonplace and they said that one point and George that this that he and Kathy took wooden spoons to you and your brother and sister om and beat them with that one night and or did you guys around the house like drill sergeants you recall that yet while that happens probably fifty times after that to solvents didn't happen work did have before you moved into the house it happened a couple times in George's house before we move to Amityville do you think because he had no parent skills and he was only ever yeah marine that's how we know how to handle things I said this is going to be a cakewalk did you try and protect you from or were you expecting her to protect you no actual on my mother to protect me fun I'm here to protect her from you I had to speak to George InSAR and call him George call only mister lots or so you had to call mister lots for sure but that when he was your stepfather so to move on had my father so you guys were just repulsed by one another at a molecular level I don't we can say I one another because George is in here but you didn't I'm sorry I can't help but smile when you say that why do you think he's here know that he's dead now you're happy that he's dead yes ma'am I and I'm and I'm freeman I had nothing to do i'd attempted him fifty times he tried to kill 'em yeah the in six months totaled story dry art back years ago yes go good as you see on a ship stock of talking about white stuff where you are right now like stones pretty complex got that all small-town charm I've been the UP yeah I don't know can I say that place a UPS the United Parcel Service driver for better than 15 years in college point like stone I know I'm gonna say fifty percent of the neighborhood on a first name basis that was one of the reasons I was able to stick around in this town after them movies came now everything went public people know me as Greg economy is believed people know me as game why well because my name was that in this movie and then my name was sack that way my name like that that movie was making sure if I didn't tell you the story that's they just thought and the girl downstairs said ticket from Amityville you and hates that's weird for you yeah in the end the they don't know until I give them the answer yeah so this would be like a daily confusion Dane I learned a lot from you think of yourself as the Amityville guy when you think private inside yourself because I am The Amityville rise I it's not that like who you think of yourself as first thought no ok and Danny okay okay so it's not your first thought about you and and you're talking to Danny yeah annual bodyguard right all I do is walk around protecting that generated that's right exactly that's what I keep thinking that you have worked so hard to be yourself whereas most people just get to be themselves you know there's a wanna says ProCare would George my stepfather would introduce himself as the Amica no he couldn't be more proud have anything I'm that guy yeah my name's my storage my family you all this is all about me yeah its biggest fuckin asshole you get over me did you feel physically threatened living inside the cells I gotta be honest with you to me want to use to get to this point II I kinda got my kicks out a for Phil something in my life that how do you mean I mean in this distinct fucked up side of my brain I couldn't possibly top those with my own cream match in Asian well there was bald spots in the house in hallways rules things like that while the furnished is she acted fire Scott half a cord soap:body for choking itself you know blankets for war like formal traps dollars house now weathered draft walk in the front door the fireplace to the left the time mister war into the dining room there's the cage there would be literally twenty degrees difference 5 stamps sparkle my gives with the Alliance head picture is next to the bathroom a on the second floor the very shocked or that platform staircase and all spots hidden change there was what I observed happens in the beginning is not something that just one person saw the entire family standing there watching the fuck garage door slam up and slammed down and slam up and slammed down and the dog is fucking himself so I would go out there with George he would pick me up and I would do I would be hanging off one side of the door and he would be pulling down on the other side of the door and we'd get in we block everything back up with the Haus we're going back into the house my sister's room was above the pool in the back yard to the right what did you see holes in the wind it would have been what looked like Inc cartoon character I love a a and angry pegged with like wolf like teeth and red eyes laser beam red eyes and at that closing the door seeing this from my sister's room I ran into the house faster than george did mated upstairs to her room and the rocking chair shit in there back and George went into a room in share up and he's looking at the chairman is looking at the legs in you thing on the floor and there's no logical explanation why this rocking chair is good doing this for 25 I'd think it was a force that was beyond my control I believe that there is a such thing as evil and I think that it can manifest itself in any way shape or form that it chooses at will and I was a victim to that what you believe I don't believe i won 90 up I know thats so others past rights right talking standing right there issued that was like the most horrible that person and that's house nope I had just gotten in a fight with George drop so but I got you second landing all the last thing to do birds or up why I I was project up the stairs into the wall others like 15 cheap stand-up and my body just like starts I no longer have control of myself I'm standing on the floor look at my mother I don't know what's course doesn't know what to say to pay and she jumps around shock like something just scraped or touched or help character Jimmy through me I have to describe what it felt like a weepy like and on this after being shocked somewhere in the rule which each was like Shop Hop page like with a cargo crackled and that stuck with me at least a decade daily basis anybody ever saw me with the Tier II edge like not should my mother I asp route want to attack wide ok she was try and all sort disliked you all rock who was possessed George and myself you feel that you were possessed I was a yeah I think that would happen at some point was extremely so far beyond my control yeah you mean in terms of your violence towards to work his towards you I think no I mean I mean know this had nothing to do with a judas having to do with me no longer having control of my body on my mind what I'm saying or what i'd how long did that last I felt like wildlife at our 25-35 minutes you men were infested with violent reactions while women Kathy said were charmed by the house and overcome with the feeling was sedated the boathouse was a source a poltergeist activity lots alleged he had gone out to check it one night and found a green slime which he dubbed poltergeist puke losing all over the place after january 6 the Feast of the Epiphany when they took down the Christmas decorations all hell broke loose Kathy said it started now as any rentable fouled Tom students use type smell stench we started going around opening all the windows and the doors all over the house I've got up to play around flies was trying to open a champ window and getting open in like Superman while strongest thing I ever did 10 and my brother and two the room he got in and I turned around to look at me I got

my mother flips over my hands she's looking back it's like workers were talkin skin on skin here go my hands swell to the size of a child's baseball five times their normal size that today to the donners and in one sacking acting ships this so that pinky see it still film from that still sent did they take you to the doctor my assignment that's every night March 1976 was to stay in the house report on any unusual activity a number psychics parapsychology is clear way in so that the man I love this were also there determine once and for all about house was possessed by some demonic forces georgian Kathy Lutz yes the the channel five news about the earlier if there was a demonic force in the house that watched by the sir he did not manifest itself physically why we the psychic suggest that the house had been neutralized the atmosphere not right at the moment that perhaps the demons well they were scared off by the crowd that our cameras self effort that was a landfill I came out on camera in our newsroom away I might add the piece like this of anime asked if I was scared during my night at the house at 112 Ocean Avenue no I was not it would be more accurate to me to say that the two hours I spent watching the movie Friday night with rowdy disruptive pot-smoking audience was much more of our the six hours I spent that house at that would leave trouble film looks as though we're convinced themselves and they took to mend at tremendous personal cost we wanted to find a story we wanted to believe them they came across as very sincere irradiated the story which we headed to quickly get on the air I went back and looked at every for that film there was nothing on film except the people who were on the telling their story the thing that I would find the Los curious thing the night that I was there would be the sensation bill place the metropolis cameraman's at the Blue he had these palpitations miss them and would covered so serious assignments war zones Ryan's and any so the was overcome by something and he could not explain he said he had no heart condition but he climb the steps sup stop camera down and I'll explain another the unexplainable lol I do recall Lorraine Warren when she went to trance saying it was a demonic force from deep in the bowels of the earth love it wasn't the sewing room yes the sewing room was the room which supposedly has the story has it where the demonic force was supposed to be the strongest all the rain 1 I'm you we went upstairs we sat on the sewing room we have amble going I remember rain that she had never felt such a force that she felt that night it was like feeling like she was in hell the rain also produced photograph which claims that there is the image oh boy this is one of the pictures that their photographer took that night you and I both know that there were no children and no animals in the house that night think look at it but then again try for great photographed think it's the let's look at the countryside for just what I know I'm not arguing at the Greek and disputing anything I've been in the house I was there the night of the murders I have the Weber interview that supposedly expose the whole thing alright so we've all been involved extensively what there's no argument there but what about the arguments that surface from one source for the other that for example reason they had to leave the house is because they let it foreclose they just didn't have the money was more money let the land serving business was just not doing very well and then he has a cell house couldn't sell house had to get out couldn't pay it as as a as a starting point will talk about okay and I starting point well I wasn't privy to their finances run however they got the house for eighty thousand dollars a purchase price of with the possessions you can always assume that this realtor Salam house up must at some point if they didn't already know that this in for this he just didn't think so it was amazing so they did okay didn't know essays makes it even worse they did not only do you know that it's that it was a scene of a mass murder now the your the belongings affect now couple get let's play let's play devil's advocate for one second I'll I've heard all the stories about they got into financial straits but how could you could they didn't have enough time to get that far behind if they were only in the house for 28 days now as to the point could he have been dreaming up a scheme yeah absolutely could have did you did you have pics could you find any evidence that he understood the local supernatural before they moved into the house that but George what specifically what George Lutz always maintained to me was that he was a non-practicing methodist the rumors that I've heard second third fourth hand over the years with that he had had an abiding interest in the occult I think that lots triggered something of by being open to it by previous activity possibly on the part over money to fail they were fooling around and got themselves in very deep was something dark and something evil that they totally didn't understand know where they were you know we were invited by the crime groups to come after the much is left the family then moved in and I'll this was in December a77 so we went through the entire place took pictures we took infrared pictures and I had a psychic one man covering up living that I've worked with for many many years Ceron make a right walks the halls but it's what you think said while and I said walked and he said tensile ritual much it costs homes she was with the lots involved in ritual magic this was all about black magic being done in this house and he fell the residual effect South with the psychological lose Natori experiences that people thought were real but they're not really real our parent only induced do or allegations that he knew more about you called them the the supernatural before they moved in than he's admitted or wherever did admit this life haiti's review had any experience before they're called with the supernatural ever before we can believe in I was purposely nosing into george's business but but there were things when you walked into george's house it wasn't inviting and welcoming if you read his a bookcase you know would range from transcendental meditation to Buddhism satanic history mind control typeof auction hypnosis books sky was into some pretty dark stuff when I started thumbing through these books in they're sacrificing virgins devil worship rallies you know shit like this and I'm reading this in the book and I walk over to my mother and she just crack me over the head said put this back and don't take it off the shelf and I looked at her and I said absolutely not you marry this guy you move me to his house what the hell is he into stupid menfolk george was not right that you can see that the dead to fear in the kids and then acknowledgement of if he's president their Jeff you know and everyone was I believe I once I can said there was a lot of fear and anxiety in our house about it there's something about his presence that made 30 as child know something is of with this man not write something not good I think that certain people can trigger things and in this case I think that whatever happened after round to fail murdered his family I think it lingered there and I think I was felt the George lots was the trigger for what started to happen to that family in Warren always talked about certain people when we were in the house the night of March 6 there were a couple people there that it said we're going from room to room antagonizing the house or the spirits well I called the Warrens up what are you in a doing can you come down here there's this case it's just broke in it's been in the news I gave her I gave in the rain the background they said sure will come right down we drove out to the house and george was meeting us there and George would not go onto the property everything was on the table a gingerbread house the kathy had made the kids for Christmas the clothes were you know strewn about newspapers there was food in the refrigerator just look like they had gone out for the day Lorraine went into one room which later one of the bedrooms and it turned out to have been running to fails room and she back to

a small part of me that look forward to get in trouble and would do anything you know you cats like when there was anger in the house more shit was going on in the house the more dramatic in the more

trying to persuade people about okay really long time ago what they could put tell me what makes you so sure so convinced that this really happened to you that you didn't a mat that its you didn't imagine it and I'm sure you've had those those feelings were you saying OK three-part second-guessing myself yeah but is there any has there ever been any point in time were you saying OK I was an angry Kid I'm really ticked off did you ever doubt yourself that this happened no DG never had a point yells at all to clear an all too real and what I saw I know I saw and I could describe it to you twenty years from now exactly like I did right now nothing's gonna change did you have any sense that whatever was there was would follow you of the property when did that start to happen well one around involves both on school my mother and three of us were basically heaped which george was injured as is personal right and then only slowly he was he watching entering shop world as we met him he was involved his believes that which practiced one is to be able to control somebody else's mines is to be able to keep object masterful heart I'd talk top I think somewhere along the line that George beliefs and practices and things that he was directly involved with triggered in was a catalyst to what was going on house was kinda like a magic trick gone bad control of what was involved with laying of hands and and recall that when you can move objects with the mind in woods telekinesis kinases thought projections and when did this start to since first minute I walked into his house in realize should two sons pixels well I mean if you walked into my eye if you walked into my house and you look to my bookcase you would pretty much see a lot love things on accusations by rivals with bookmarks and pictures you photographed all on wall but I have a lot of books on site on various aspects love parapsychology the the supernatural I have a couple books on with witchcraft and magic but let's face it I mean what do you think the chances realistically what do you think the chances were that no matter how many books George read that he was going to be able to start moving objects with asthma I witnessed you witnessed what exactly george's ability to move objects with out touch them with his mind in his garage before we even got there he was in the garage with his friends you can ranches just like that like this walk over with them down takes them a couple minutes to get there it takes about 12 is gone and it would take about a minute to drop it by he kindling and I was not supposed to know their search which tumbled in on an after-school my mother didn't know I'm run into their I don't know I didn't know if she knew at that time my way told she looked to me like what colder out into the garage and I want you to show my mom what you just did right now and the guys got all and last didn't say a word and I have a doctors appointment at night to I when I told the doctor second by second where didn't offer an explanation he just kept praised we think he said role he had conversation for drop me off using comes in 15 minutes later they talk for another 20 minutes go at this point I with the doctor I would recommend it to your mother find a new boyfriend or he he needs your son needs to go for tester something this is this is just an incredible tale from there's a doctor out there somewhere with that story in his file in handwriting people can exaggerate what they've experienced they can exaggerate a little or exaggerate a lot they can add details to an experience to make the story more interesting %ah and that there are lots of reasons why people might do that I mean for one thing a we remember bits and pieces have experience but will fill in the gaps in our memory with other bits of information things we learned from other places inferences we drew which we decide probably happen and we use those two fill in the gaps memory their also maybe a motivation to remember things in a way that is a little bit more dramatic little bit more interesting now believes that saw his stepfather move objects without touching and the question and where did that come from it might be a speculation that it could have come from the stepfather saying you know I can do this and the little boy started think I I saw him do it and when the story start to change then it's time to become suspicious I be afraid to be in that house knowing that there had been a mass murder in again we go back to the whole thing about it what is the imagination why starring and just take off and then the influence a father feeling this on children who I've been involved in so many these cases with children are so sensitive not going to what's happening in an environment possibly power normally but also to the Q's they get from their parents most people do not want the glare these they do not wanting names we feel because of their business associations and everything else I can be effected they don't want to expose their children very important to not any loving parent does not want to inflict on a child anyone who does that is is demonic is the so-called forces that were released in this case psychological scars is something that are hard to expose and and share with people and while I'm an extremely emotional person by nature and that doesn't mean I like to share when you watch him tell the stories he he looks very believable and he tells the story and away that is almost guaranteed to get other people to believe him its detail he's confident he expresses it was a motion those are the things that people look to you to decide that they're hearing an authentic story in my opinion the suggestion with this ten-year-old boy started when he was 10 helium with adults who believed in the paranormal who believed in the end call call perhaps were who had books on me paranormal telekinesis who may have been talking about things and then discussions family members interviews ok their site he soaked and suggestions I think one excellent example is this story about a priest coming to bless the house and then for five years later there's a film that comes out which shows that that priest is overtaken by a swarm of flies and now this once 10-year-old boy now older has got a recollection remembering flies hundreds and hundreds of lives so did he get that from the post-event suggestion of the film %ah or not the last night in the house when did you leave was a school day was a regular day during week my brother and myself share levitation experience in our bedroom in our beds this would be a arvit here because my bed was on during this window was bad news this way on that wall so we would be like toe to toe that way wrong we both woke up that are headboards are footboards word smashing each other and hanging off the ceiling on the last night that were in there the boys hats were being watched it up and slammed down overhead at me but I could not get up out of bed happy levitated I had to grab her to keep her from going off this is after she had turned into and an old flown really agree old woman that literally took hours and hours for it to go away we talk we try to talk to on the right number of times we've got on static hung up on unable to call now government office and be able to talk to him and tell him what was going on we ask you to come back to the house wanted you know the bosnian worked yes is why we were still there that's when I was slammed home you're leaving I had no say in moving Monday say go back to back going to Grandma's just get in the van were getting at whatever I don't know never coming back here no leaving every fuckin thing I've ever owned okay see you just ran out you were all in night clothes guy was wearing whatever God said you know i'd and jobs are pretty sure me in on that said they weren't going back to the house the left all their possessions there but the bank foreclose on the house they were the subject of intense scrutiny George wasn't working anymore kathy was not working she had three kids and they moved they they often moved to the other side of the country you know they wanted to get as far away from Amityville as they could we were looking for family therapy and I said mom we can even talk about this in our own house in Cornwall with more logical explanations and and now you wanna tell the world's what we can't even figure out ourselves why would you want to do that how are we gonna do that why you do in a there's nobody in the neighborhood doesn't know my mom and she's going on TV shows and yet I should dare and you know in school is as a grade school student teaches your movie was on last night really happened what would you say I you wanna just like could punch you in the face and leave right they were chased all over the country I mean literally changed the kids couldn't go to school harassed I mean this before pop Arazi they weren't they would leave them alone no phone calls not thing that's how we track their movements burst through the meat once the Amityville thing happened in I started changing mentally and emotionally I'm just redirected everything and became hyper aggressive apparently think I D large advanced to promotional torrent it was going to be. for probably close to a year if not maybe a little more or they're going on this world swarm wound up getting dumped off J Catholic Church monastery school I Caden authority problem I didn't care preach were beating the shit out of me performing extensions which if I'm not mistaken they don't want to talk about tell me about that what I mean performing exorcisms performing axis isms like speaking in tongues laying on hands holy water splashing violent Falken the bodily convulsions up which five axis is and do I need to explain why would they have done this because I was possessed by a spirit that I could not get rid of mining so I ran away from the church a couple times priest free to share that I'd said Georgian capital any communication with you during this time stumped you on I didn't talk to my mother for probably the better part of the year in and to be honest but she showed up I don't have much to say in many ways it will follow you for a long long long time to come why did you go public full before we went public some other people stand for us and widely exaggerated stories and this on in order to convict him those things you to live with us sweet most world that I no longer exist I could not separate reality from what was called came points where it was like this family nightmare come true I could not to see it was almost like being awake in your own tree but I used to hate living a lifestyle a structured lights all of a sudden you know in a matter of like six-month period this whole time you know old house moved have no friends discarded shit outta me mom no longer mom I used to know I would say between 12 and 15 probably ran away about a times for a total about two years I would have been about to stern 15 something I had a problem I was gone later lived in the orange group Salt Lake got a job in a gas station in go to school in what has been the worst part a the whole Amityville experience for you that I didn't get to tell my story the first time are there any silver linings in the class anything come and have any deal you feel was good I'm gonna go with string be on strike and I didn't know that was there a time when the hauntings or the strange incidence stop world they had stopped for me in Arizona while I was by myself do you believe they stop for the rest of the family no I ended invoked the only thing in life that that that scares me the only things the in my life that that i truly fear all the things that are just beyond my control I'm not talking about man-made situations that are beyond your control there is and elements love for whatever label we want to put our name you know easel tomorrow conspirator whatever the fuck you want to call it it exists under whatever label you wanna put it on and sad thats the hardest thing for me to do continued with I because I know that it's true and it in my feeling about it has always the let's is may have experience with item what I call low-level param from some other hallucinogenic something that noone whose engine so the question becomes let's say we could do this all over it and let's say we kept the process an investigator went and talk to the Lexus and took that testimony could the ethical hard as we know it had been spoke my feeling is now I do even with the back any fans have backdrop of those mass murders your I do not belief based upon what the Lexus claims that the experienced in that house would be enough to make this case now nobody could have predicted what has instead so something happen the question is why and the effect psychologically on the family I do believe the losses believe that they experience something that was unusual I wanted to believe the story I want to find some evidence that it was true as a reporter we are naturally very skeptical and I C you know show me the evidence and that night I saw no evidence anything that was unusual in that house I do believe that their forces out there that are beyond comprehension of our normal five senses I think that there were other forces at work and I think it would be very very hard for a boy who had just turned 10 years old to distinguish between in some cases fact fantasy reality I think george's particular personality made him susceptible to that and it fit of him what you think danny is at right blaming him for the haunting to take place because Danny blames george for taking his mother away and for have it is convenient for him don't think it's just convenient I think he really believes it I mean in a sense there was a was a loss of control very hard have gone through life have in the past been trying to people not believe you 90 like a mouse exactly I totally understand now why you can smash it I just wanted somebody to believe me right must make you feel crazy not having people believe you would you be willing this summit to a lie detector test a polygraph I've been asked that many times and I've had doctors asked priests ask me that my friends asked me my ex-wife at that is there something at that little electronic devices going to tell you that you cannot believe more than me yeah what is that I'm just listen to you was wayne feat and what say you I mean would you or would you know law on have words with you after this is done people and shit like down on me which is not funny wouldn't be doing this if I thought they needed a fucking lie detector test when I yes who I feel I need he's gonna satisfy your fucking mind I'm not saying you're lined and I'm just asking you lot of people will be asking are will I know that I knew that a long before you asked well I'm his voice in the opinion on the audience you my voice i guess i cnt anything else you like that at I I I in
