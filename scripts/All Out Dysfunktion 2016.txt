Fucking white cracker bitch... Ooh, this bitch don't know. You fuckin' stupid... Don't you know i got shit to do, bitch? Yeah, you'd better chill with that shit, don't you fucking throw that at me. Don't you know I will wipe your honky ass up, bitch? Cum dumpster bitch. Crazy ass white bitch, all skinny, throwing up and shit. Who the fuck does that shit? You ain't never gonna have an ass like this, bitch! Never! Who the hell are you? Yeah, excuse you, too. I don't like your face. Okay, boys, where was I? Mama's gonna take care of all you nasty suckers. And by the time I'm done with y'all, y'all gonna be some dirty ass wet noodles. You motherfuckers want to see me play with this right? Well, since you're all platinum members of pleasure's paradise, you motherfuckers are gonna get a look-and-see. Oh, yes. Oh! Oh, yeah, oh, I'm about to squirt. I'm gonna give it to you in the style of an orangutan. Oh, yes! Yes! I'm gonna squirt! Oh! Oh, I'm gonna give you the punch of a donkey! Oh! What the fuck is going on around here? Ay, "cariba"! Buenos dias, mamacita! Shut up! Have you not seen all the people fucking parading around the house? Have you noticed that your nose is having a heavy flow day? Oh, you did, 'cause you jammed a tampon up there, good for you! Shut the fuck up, all right? Your breath smells like a fucking slave ship. Wow! Oh, fuck! Look, you've lived here long enough, you know pretty much anything goes. Really? What the fuck is that? Ah, relax. It's for my new indie film. - Gonna be hot! Pa-pow! - Who raised you? - I mean, seriously. - My mom, okay? I had a very nice upbringing, thank you. Listen, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. Was that you vacuuming at like, 5:00 am? You know what? Eat me, gator. Nobody scratches anything for me around here, so fuck off, okay? Well, maybe if you had better skin, we'd be more willing to scratch things for you. Shit. It's just a natural reaction I've had ever since I was little. Every time mama comes real good, I cry, that's all. That's it for pleasure's paradise today. I'll see all you dirty motherfuckers tomorrow. Whoopsie. Shit. Grow some courage. Always hiding behind your mask. Tough horny guy "curry stick" - with a long schlong. How is my little son doing? Have you been able to find a job with that beautiful, shiny American degree? Why are you sweating? The house is a little hot. That is all, that's why I'm sweating. I'm still freelancing, web coding and trying to find steady work. But I must talk to you later, huh? Why are you rushing me? Please, papa. I need more time. It's really hot. - More time? - I need to clean. Huh, you want to live like a transient forever? No, I will not let you live like that. You will live like a very good Indian hard-working boy. American culture is not like Indian culture, papa. That is why I'm saying American culture is very different from Indian culture. Indian culture is very good culture. Two more months, no more, that is it. Yes, papa. And one more thing. How is that American woman? I understand American woman very good with the mouth. Huh? No hands? Your mother... not very good with the mouth. Bite sometime. Eyes pop out, not good. - Papa, please. - What happen? Your eyes pop out? Don't be shy, ranjit, i see the way you look at me. You nasty. Ranjit, what up? Dude, I finally figured out how to make my fingers Dutch. You hungry? Want some yum-yums? Stupid huta. That's disgusting. Oh, god, things are not settling well from last night. Where I come from, people do not burp this way in front of others. You are a dirty pashu. Wait, what's pashu? Pashu, an animal, a beast, a brute. That is so sweet. I should get that tattooed on my heart. Pashu. - You are worthless. - Mm-hmm. Where's my coffee? Sorry, dude, i had a production meeting this morning and I was tired. Needed to drink it all. What the fuck, pashu? This is expensive coffee, man. - Wasn't that good. -I'm tired of you taking advantage of my things. Name four things. I buy rice, and you're burning the rice. - One time. -I buy curry, and you are burning the curry. You're right, that one's on me. - That one was my fault. - My coffee's from India. Look, your coffee, I'll buy you some more tomorrow, okay? Good god, this guy is crazy. - Who? - That black guy, Tyrell. Why he gotta be black, huh? He's got a name. I don't go around calling you brown guy ranjit. Because he's black. I'm gonna call you brown guy ranjit, then. Fuck you, pashu, i mean, who labels everything? By name, taste, spoilage dated, perfectly matching containers? Have you seen him open a door? Guys, guys, good morning, good morning, - good morning. - Good morning. Hi! Can you please do me a favor? If you're going to talk about me, - just do it to my face. - Fair enough. And can you please, please not touch my things? Especially you, gator, with your filthy hands. Well, excuse me and my filthy hands. Calm down, Tyrell. We're just playing around. Yeah, man, just playing around, it's not like you're the only person on the entire planet who uses a handkerchief to touch his weenie. All right, let's just be honest. Just because my state of cleanliness is on a higher level of consciousness than both you two neanderthals, it's gonna protect me from bacteria eating me from the inside out. Did you know that warmth and moisture are the key components to bacterial growth? Hmm? Have you ever heard of salmonella? E. Coli? Listeria? Bro, the bottom line is that even a kitchen counter has 50 times more bacteria on it than a toilet seat. Not mine. My Booty's pretty clean. - I sit down to pee. - I know. What? You think that's weird? Ask him how he poops. How do you shit? I use a squatty potty. You know it really comes out silky and smooth. That's what you keep telling me. But that's not the point. If the earth opened up and beelzebub hit you with fire and brimstone, you better believe that I would be licking a toilet seat way before I would lick a kitchen cutting board. - That's fucked up, dude. - No, no, no, no. And I'm not done. Did you also know... look at this... that a kitchen sponge is one of the most bacterially infested items in the entire household? A single bacterial cell can multiply into over 80 million cells in 24 hours. That is some serious "fuck-you-up" shit, so while you guys are running around, scratching your balls and rubbing your asses and touching the kitchen sponge, I will keep my sanitizer and I will be safe. And while you two little germies are crying bloody mercy, pissing out of every single little baby orifice in your body, dehydrated as a fuckin' arab, I will be okay. So, do me a favor and keep your hands off my shit! What the hell are you pencil pricks - hemming and hawing about? - This is very sad. You brown-nosing, circle-jerking teabaggers make some coffee yet? My Stein is dry. We would, but Mr. snuff film drank it all. Oh, oh, oh, oh, you touched my tupperware and you're a snitch? That's why your mama has three teeth. Huh? One in her mouth, and two in her pocket. - What's my mother got to do with any... - cut it out! I am tired of playing momma dearest around here, so you ball-slappers best make nice or I'll whip out the metal hangers! Ranjit, here's ten bucks. Go get us all some coffee, and none of that cheap shit, I want something nice that they enslave people in south America for. And keep your mitts off people's shit! - Why me? He... cap it! "Speed your way" easy chairs, your hope for elderly scooters. This is clarelle, how can I help you? It's a bit of a shitter, but it's got potential. It's kinda shitty. Fuckin' shitty. You're looking at the star of fashion week if you can pull this off. - Yeah, pull that shit all off. - High ceilings. - But we don't have any color. - Hello! -Calm down, price. Why is it always me? Come on, I'll show you why we really came here. There's four bedrooms down the hall that aren't even being used, and wait till you guys see this. - Okay, pull her arms back. Yeah, that's good. That's how we like it. Mmm-hmm. Now arch your back, baby. Arch your back. Now ride him. Pull out slow. Slower! Slower! And punch! Cut! God damn it, cut! And what is this? Amateur day? And what is that? Huh? Your dick is flapping around like cock snot. Hello! Anybody home? Pleasure, do me a favor and get into makeup while I talk to silly putty super schlong over here. 'Cause your face look like shit. What you say, motherfucker? Now listen here, miss ghetto fab, and listen good. Now I don't wanna hear any flim flam coming out of your mouth, 'cause you're fucking with your money, and more importantly, you're fucking with my money, and I don't take too kindly to that shit. Now, you're the star of this fucking show, and if it was up to me, I'd bury your head in a mound of pillows, and unlucky for me my bosses didn't hire me to shoot "ass pounders 254," so, taking your beat-up face and burying it in a mound of pillows isn't exactly an option. Take your bootylicious ass to makeup, don't pass, go, collect $200, till I fucking say so! Makeup! Fix her fuckin' gorilla chin. - I need a money shot! -I don't like to see her treated this way. Dude, she's a porn chick, she takes platoons of penises in her butt for a paycheck. I don't care. She's still a person. Hey! One fucking voice! Where you goin', punjab? Know what? Fuck you, man. Don't talk about my people. I don't have to take this shit anymore, okay? That was hot. Now that that's settled. - I'd fuck him. - Hey, assy. My name is azeebo. Oh, I know what they call you. I write your two dollar contracts. Hey, hey, there are a lot of people around. You think I give a fuck? What's my name? Mike mix under thunder. What's my name, down syndrome dick? Mike mix under thunder. Say it like you're getting your ass hole licked. Mike mix under thunder! Yes! Now get used to that six syllable name. You know why I get a six syllable name? 'Cause I'm fucking successful. So, remember that sound, because I can make or break your career just like that, and all you'll hear is the sound of Mike mix under thunder fucking you in the ass unless you get that black rhino to turn to steel. You got me? Yes. Hey, fluffer! Mouth, dick, go! Okay, everybody, take five. Come here, mufasa. My name is azeebo! Whatever, zebra. Zebra? This is racial profiling. I'm not happy with these working conditions... oh, oh, oh. That's good. What do you think? This is more like it. I like it. I like it a lot. Okay. Stage here. Got to check the breaker box for secondary power. We've got serious capacity here. Vip area down there. Yes, baby. Can do. - Glitter. - Bruce, what about security? Just the usual, man. It's going deep. Okay, price, on the dial. I want you to reach out to all the social networks. We got a new venue, guys. - Get on that dial, bitch. - On it. Hey, there, get up. Let me take a look at you. Do you perform? - I... - And what's with the mask? Uh... If... if you can smell sex, then sex is airborne. You can see it on the couch and some on his skin and I can maybe smell it on your breath. - Do you like to fuck? - I don't... 'cause I got some pretty hot ass here. Yeah, she's hot. Yeah, no, i can see it now. Look it. "Ebony rising." Fuck, yeah. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Pole vaultin' the moon. You've got good throw. I can make it a interracial thing. - But I don't pole vault. - I didn't even make varsity. - Crystal. - I... no. - Get your white ass over here. - That's... yeah, that's... - yes, Mike? - Hi. Suck his cock. Hey, there, big winner. Gator, gator, ah! Okay, okay, armadillo, armadillo. - Camp, camp, camp. - What are you, a "fage"? No. - Hey, David. - It's slurp and burp. God, you're so loud. What are you doing? No! Can I play with the big winner? No, you can't play with the big winner. - I need some help, gator. - Yep, solution right here. I love blowjobs. I love 'em. - Shh, shh, shh, shh. Let's go! Let's go! I am ready, Mike. - Just give it to me straight. - I am strong like spear. - It's too many germs. - Let me get this right. You are turning down getting some of the greatest head of your life from one of the hottest girls - in my library... - it's nice to meet you. because you don't like germs? Yeah, that's... that pretty much sums it up. Well, you better get used to it, you pencil-poker piece of pussy lint! Welcome to L.A.! Oh, yes, Mike. I am ready. First a.D., can I talk straight to the talent? Oh. Grow some fucking balls. "Welcome to L.A." Look, there's one more thing. There's this old lady, clarelle, who manages this place. I don't think she's gonna be cool with us having a party here last minute. I'll deal with the roommates, but... Don't tell me you dragged me all the way here to ghetto valley to tell me that it's not gonna work. I'm giving you $2,000 and enough coke to melt your face. - Face, bitch. -Let me explain something to you. I don't care about ravers. I don't care about music. And I don't give a fuck about people. What I care about is my money and my time, so don't fuck with my money or my time. In about three hours, I'm on a plane to Miami. If you don't come through, you're gonna face a shitstorm of unimaginable. So, now what are you gonna do about this old lady, clarelle? I don't know. Can we knock her out or something? How old is she? - Sixty or 70? - Fuck. We can't fuck her up. We can knock her out, though. Oh, every day at 6:00, she goes out back and she waters her flowers. - Fuck, I'll just chloroform the bitch. - Okay, everything's a go. Ooh, cocktails. Ah, fuck it. I'm just gonna inject that bitch with acid. Have that bitch seeing rainbows. Jesus, I don't want to kill her. Shut the fuck up, bitch. We're not gonna kill her. We're just gonna put her to sleep. And, on that note, we're gonna set up and break down. By the time she wakes up, everything will be back to normal. You get your gig in cash, bitch. Gig in motherfuckin' cash. Will you shut the fuck up? Seriously. Come on, dig, bitch. All right, look, you guys. We're gonna go out the same way we came in. She's the old lady that's standing out front. You can't miss her. Bruce, give me a bump. For the love of god. Oh, yeah, you want some of Mr. moist? - Just give me some. - Want my dick? Shut up, just give it to me. Say you want my dick, bitch. Say it. - Say it. - I want your coke. Like that shit? All right. Okay, a deal's a deal, all right? And if anything goes wrong, I'm gonna cut off your fucking balls and I don't owe shit, you broken record motherfucker. Now get the fuck outta here. And that goes for you, too, scooter. Fucking bitch. Isn't she saucy? Ranjit? Something I can do for you? Hi. Huh, I was just looking for something. You know, something. Laundry room's down the hall, bro. Yes. Yes, the laundry room is down the hallway, but I was admiring your, uh, uh, unique film antiquities and glorious memorabilia. You know, you have a lot of space here. You know, you could probably milk a cow. It's nice. Yeah, my old man's a cinematographer. I'm lactose intolerant. But, you know what, let's cut out this first date chitchat bullshit. What the fuck are you doing in here? Okay, pashu. I'm angry and I'm pissed and I'm wanting to hurt that director, and I know you had some things in your room and I'm looking for something to beat him with. You know what happened to the last person that went rummaging around through my stuff? Let's just say... I'm still on medication. Do you know why they call me gator, ranjit? It's because I'm hard to tame. Please, pashu, no, no. Oh, man! Got you! Oh, you should see your face right now. I wish you could. It is so stupid-looking. You look like a hostage. You look like you're really mad at me. And you look stupid. Crazy fucking pashu. You're awesome, dude. You're amazing. You're like a fucking curry dahmer. - Yes. - -Quiet on the set! You know what? I'm sorry. Yep, you got it. Shh, listen. Don't worry about that guy. - Okay? You proved your point with him. I never knew you had so much heart. Come in here. Get over here. Yes, booby traps everywhere. There's no treading in gator's house. You are completely unhinged. You... you are a sociopath. No, I'm just kidding. Don't hurt me, please. Listen, there's a lot of girls getting dicks slapped on their foreheads out there. I want to see what I can get on this guy. Put it on the Internet later. Try and make us some money. Make yourself at home. You break it, you buy it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Look at me. Look at me. I am coming! I am coming! This is why they call me the black rhino! - This is for Botswana! Cut! God damn it, cut! That's the fucking money shot. Holy dick roll. What the fuck did you eat? There he is. Pleasure, I don't give a hootenanny what you do in your own damn room, but the living room is community property. - Hi, ma'am. -Don't you ma'am me. - I run this house. So, you better get your fresh-out-of-film-school wish-you-had-a-better-job stuck-in-a-porn peacock feathers the hell out of my way. It's all good. This is gonna be a big movie for me. Yesterday you said you were doing a photo shoot, not shooting a goddamn porn. I'm writing you up. I'm telling Harold. - Now, where is he? - He is the guy. Now, you listen here, you two-bit crackerjack. I like nothing more than some good, old huffin' and puffin', so I support your industry, but what i will not support is your two-inch penis running around my house insulting my tenants with more arrogance than a Kentucky drunk with a Napoleon complex! Peanut butter sassafras! Ah, holy shit! - What's with the plastic bag? -I was worried he was gonna bleed. Do you have a handkerchief? Everybody out. And get this asshole out of here before he wakes up. - Clarelle... -i don't want to hear it. - I'm writing you up. All I do is try to look out for you kids. And you sure as hell don't make it easy for me. Fuck. Fuck this. I'm going back into construction. Oh, god. That smells like donkey piss. Any time, shit, otherwise, i wouldn't be able to see you. Fuck you, cream pie. Get the fuck out of my face. You wanna fight, midnight? 'Kay, Jesus Christ. I don't even need zoom on you girls. Hello. I'm gator. Yeah, like a gator. All right. He's hot. Grr. Gators don't go grr. They go rr. Hey. That was nice, what you said about how people treat me and stuff. Thanks for sticking up for me. You're like my phula. The what? In my culture, phula means flower. To me, you are like that. Oh, come here. Careful, careful, careful, careful. What up, Joe Frazier? Dude, dope cross. I didn't even see you coming. - Thanks, gator. - Yeah. - You think it's broken, clarelle? - Yeah, it's broken. Will you put that damn camera away? No can do, sorry. We'll wrap it at the articular disc and give you a splint. You'll be fine, okay? Gator, grab a bag of frozen veggies and wrap it in a towel. Yes, ma'am. I'll go outside, make sure bozo leaves. Hurry. Carrie, you gotta see this. Check this out. - Fuckin' hard, man. - I totally missed the punch, but I totally got the fall. Ready? Three, two, boom. I don't fucking care. You're so annoying. "You're so annoying." Move. Tell your little cronies that the flowers are around back. Thank you. That's a down payment, pussy cat. Okay, ew. Get the fuck off me and leave. Let's go. We'll see. Fuckers. My room, now. Look, I don't know what you have planned, and, frankly, i don't care. Odds are, clarelle's not siding with you, and scooter is bad news. Coming from me, that's a pretty big deal. If you want this thing to go off, you need my help and I want half. Fuck you, gator. All right, remember your little weed growing operation you had in here? Payback, fucker. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Okay, well, go ahead and call your little boy toy and tell him that his party's off. - Clarelle! - All right, look. I'll give you a third. Half. You know, you may think your fucking hot shit around here 'cause you're the little handyman and clarelle's favorite and everything, but don't fuckin' forget that outside of this house, you ain't fuckin' shit, you weird little fuck. Oh, pfft. I am the coolest dude in this house - and you know that. - Okay. But do not piss me off, little miss thing. Because it'll be a bad payday. And I know that the face and all this is how you make your money, so I'd hate to fuck that up, too. Are you threatening me? Call it what you like, darling. Half. Sugar pie, honey bunch. You know, fuck you, gator. Fuck you. All right? I have been in this fucking town for four fucking years doing some really degrading shit, taking some really fucked up jobs just to get anywhere, all right? Now, I finally feel like I have a shot. This deal could get me on a hot runway that I need to be on. Get the exposure that I finally need, you know? I just... i can't go back. I can't go back to the fuckin' fields and the trailer parks and the beer drinking rednecks who just fuck me for fun so that they can go and tell their friends. I won't do it, all right? I need this. I can't handle this fuckin' town and the fucking rejection any longer. I just need to feel like I'm doing something, like I'm worth something, you know? I can't fucking fail now, all right? Ew, are you crying? Yeah, fuck you, dude. I'm having a fucking breakdown here. I need your fucking help, okay? What about clarelle? Scooter said he was gonna take care of it. It'll be fine. And you believe that? This is fucked up. I've, uh... Been here, well, about ten years now. Don't let too many people in here. Mm, thanks for the invite. Is that you onstage? Oh, yeah. Wow, you look amazing. Oh, that was the good old days. Ran in the circles with the greats from the glory days of off Broadway. Years I spent in New York doing understudy work and walk-ons from everything from brecht to Chekhov. - Chekhov? - Mm-hmm. I played trofimov in my third year. Oh, you were an idealist. - I played Anya in '74. - I was. The critics loved me. It was gonna be my break to Broadway. So, what happened? What happens to so many starlets and wild-hearted artists. We fall in love. I got pregnant. Had a miscarriage. After the miscarriage, the only thing that healed him was booze, and when he found the bottle, the thing that healed me were ice packs and bandages. I'm really sorry. Oh, I was a wild one, too. In this biz, it's hard to step out once you're already in. Men have all the power, right or wrong, and women... They're easily forgotten. So, I got up and moved to L.A. in '77. Weren't you afraid? Sure, I was. But I was more afraid of not making it, of never winning that statue. More afraid of failing myself. What are you afraid of? Struggle. Whether or not I... Think I could be good enough. I guess I'm also afraid of whether I can get over my own issues... And actually do it. Yeah, I... I am afraid. The fact that you know that... Puts you ahead of the game. You know, I may never have gotten my obie or my Tony or my Oscar. But I was in it and I found glory. And nobody can take that away from me. Well, that's enough of that crap. I've got to go and tend to my flowers. By the way... Take this. I have no use for it anymore. - What is it? - Sand. From the backstage bags of my first leading role off-Broadway. And don't go putting that sterilizer all over it. That's your first assignment. Not... not all, but some grit is good. Yes, ma'am. Now get outta here. Go on. - I really can't... -I'm an old lady and I can't take too many visitors. Thanks... Get. for everything. What happened, Paul? Clarelle, there you are. Jeez, you are about as hard to get conference with as the pope. Listen, got a lot of things going on this month, which, by the way, I'm gonna be a little late - on rent again. -Gator, I don't want to hear it. I've had your back for the past three months, and you know Harold's a Jew. So, there's only so far I can go. And don't forget, i only run this shack. Clarelle, wait a minute. I've been keeping up on plumbing, I've been keeping up on drywall. I have a whole list of things that I need to get this place tip-top. Gator, kiss my patootie. The walls need fillin', the toilets are busted. Your only job here is to fix this damn house, and that pays your rent. Nobody even uses those toilets anyway. They're all filled up with poo. Well, maybe somebody'd take a shit in there if they were white and working. I know I told your mother I'd take care of you. That's what godmothers are for. Your mother's like a sister to me. I'd do anything for her and you. But I can't keep this umbilical cord attached forever, so tomorrow I need $800 out of you or I'm serving you eviction papers. Clarelle, how can you expect... do you think Janet and Gary would be proud of what their son's become? It's time for you to man up. It breaks my heart. I love you like a son. When you... when you were a teenager... I always thought you'd be great. Well, there's still time for that. Now, not another word. I've got to go and tend to my flowers. Who is it? Hey, ren-ren. Oh. Hello. Please come in. Wow. Your room smells... Really good in here. It's very tech-y and stuff. So, how can I help you, Carrie? I have a favor to ask of you. So, I'm throwing a party later. Oh, I really like parties. You know, my father in India, he's a really good dancer. He does this bhangra dance thing. He's a... yeah, okay, ranjit, we all have a dad. Jesus. Anyway, what I need you to do for the party, don't tell anybody and please don't do anything stupid when my friends are here. And also don't tell clarelle. Can you do that for me? What do I get in return? I thought maybe we could work out a deal, hmm? Oh, yes. I'm really liking this. - Oh, god. - Yeah? Creamy and American and white. Mm. Okay, so, we have a deal, then? Maybe later we'll have a little fun? Hmm? What kind of fun, my wild snow leopard? Fun that you will never forget. - Oh. Mm. - Oh, my god. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You have to wait. Till later. Hmm, what's wrong, kitty cat? Nothing. We just, um... I just want it to be really special for you, ran-ran, okay, hmm? So, I'm going to be wanting you and your two girlfriends. What? Okay, if not, no party. I'll tell clarelle. Okay, fine. That's fine. Mm, good. I'm going to need you to text me two photographs of your friends, and we meet here tonight. Oh, yeah, one more thing. I'm going to need a deposit. I don't have any fucking money. Hmm. That's a down payment, pussy cat. Okay, ew, get the fuck off me and leave. Where did you get that? Hmm, my resources are none of your concern. But I encourage you to please keep listening. I'll fucking give you half. Fuck you, all right? I have been in this fuckin' town for four fucking years... - How do you even... - The most degrading shit... Who the fuck are you? - Seriously? - Shh. Snow bunny, hmm? A couple of hundred and we meet here tonight. - You motherfuck... - please hand over a deposit. And it will be 100% refundable once we... Can't fucking believe this. Stop. You're so creamy. I'm sure you're filled with juicy goodness. Oh, if I licked you from the outside in, I'm sure you would taste like j-e-l-l-o. Okay, gross. Come on. Oh, yes. I like it. I've been a naughty schoolboy. Spank me. Oh, my god. You are a fucking pervert. You are truly disgusting. Where do you think you're going, bitch? Excuse me, aunt jemima. Aunt jemima. That's cute. - You like that? - Was this before or after she took off the rag? I don't know, bitch. You got a weave. - Don't touch me. Well, now that I know what you up to, that little cute designer purse is mine. - Oh, this one? - Yeah. - Fuck you, bitch. -Who you callin' a bitch, bitch? Phula. Yeah, you better have my back, motherfucker. Now, listen to me, bitch. Hold that bitch. This little fucking designer purse, like I said, and everything in it is mine, all right? And if you want your little fiesta to go off without a hitch, these are my motherfuckin' terms. Now tap out, bitch, and let me know you good. Squeeze her. Tap out, bitch! Fuck you. Hey, let her go. She's dying. Oh, no, I been choked by a lot of niggas with big dicks. Trust me, I know what a bitch can take. Tap out, bitch. Give me the fucking purse. - Oh. - You good? See you later. Ah, do you know there are 612 seconds in exactly 10.2 minutes and I have been out here for 645, 646. Do you have any idea what that kind of heat does to the immune system? My mom just died. Oh, fuck. Yeah, she was my best friend. Look, I'm sorry if I came on too strong, okay? I can totally relate. My mom passed away right after I finished school. Right after the funeral, i had to get the hell out of New York. I feel completely lost, i mean, fuck, Carrie, I don't even have a fucking agent. Well, maybe today's your lucky day. I really need to get myself out of this headspace that I'm in, so I thought I'd throw a party here tonight. And, you know, there's gonna be some really - important people there. - And I'm sure clarelle is just happy about that. Yeah, she's gonna go out for the night. Look, clarelle and i are really tight, okay? Tighter than you two are, so, you know, she totally trusts me. If you don't go and be a whiny little bitch and cry to clarelle about the party, maybe I'll introduce you to Vinnie tonight. - He's an agent. - Don't touch me. 'Cause god only knows what kind of mold and parasites live between your legs - and all over your body. - Just shut up, all right? This is gonna open up some really big doors for you. Look, Vinnie is a huge agent, all right? And, besides, Hollywood is always looking for their next up-and-coming colored talent. "Colored," really? That's so bigot of you. - Fuck off. - Oh, come on. This is gonna be a big deal for you. Yeah? And why the fuck should I believe you? - Why would I lie to you? -Because you're a fucking manipulating, conniving little bitch. What are you so afraid of, hmm? Making a deal with the devil, that's who. Pinky swear? I wouldn't trust that pinkie if it was mine. Fool me once, but it won't happen again. And the only way i get out of this house is by booking jobs. So, if your buddy shows up and everything goes exactly the way you tell me it will, I will owe you for life. But if anything goes south, don't ever look in my fucking direction ever again. Deal. Now leave. - Bye. - Cunt. Thank you. Oh. Oh, oh, yes. Oh. Oh. Oh, thank you. Hey. Hey, I gotta pee. I just want to talk to you in private, okay? Now, tell me. What the fuck were you doing making business deals with that bitch Carrie, huh? You trying to make mommy jealous? - Here, take a shot. - No, I prefer not to. Shut up. Just take it. Open up. Burns, right? Feels good, right? Hmm? - Listen. - What? Listen. I... I want to know why you cry. Oh, that's not important right now. No, no, no. Because people don't cry when they... Oh, I get it. You want to get personal. I'll show you fucking personal. How's this for personal, huh? - That personal enough? - People will see. I don't give a fuck who sees. Look at me. Look at me, ranjit. - Look at me. - Okay, okay. Look at me, okay? Focus. Okay.

Don't so fucking... damn it, ranjit, why you gotta make me feel this way? This is my life. This is what I do. This is who I am, but I didn't ask for this shit. And I'm a fucking ho. I fuck for money. It's really fucking hard for me to see what's real and what's fake. You don't know me, ranjit. But I want to know. You want to know that my mom was a meth head? And my dad used to have his friends come over when my mom was in the streets to have his friends fuck me? And I was taken away by child services, okay? And raised in a fucking white family. Fucking white school where everybody made fun of me. Called me a nigga, a spook. And sometimes I wish the voices in my head would just stop and I feel like a fucking fake. What else do you want to know? My phula. No, no, no, don't. Don't feel bad for me. This is my life. This is what I chose, so this is what I do. And if there's anything genuine about what you're saying to me, then I have to let you know. 'Cause I'm not the one. No. I can't love you, ranjit. I'm too busy trying to fucking love myself. Boom!
