Venice- the city of silence. That cannon, ladies and gentlemen, is fired off every day to indicate the noon hour. Every day in Venice at noon, you hear, boom. In Venice, there are 177 canals measuring 28 miles, and there are 156 bridges connecting 114 islands. And there is the great Church of St. Mark. The Church of St. Mark was begun in 830, but was not finished until the 15th century. There are more than 500 marble columns in the Church of St. Mark. The mosaic work covers an area of 45,970 square feet, and the interior is completely produced and decorated... Are you finished, Caryl? Yes. Until 7:00. You're a darling to have waited so long. I didn't mind. You know, you must be made of strawberry ices. Oh... did you ask Ilanti for an increase in salary? Yes. And he said no. Then you shouldn't be working here. Darling, you're a genius. Oh, please don't say that, Fenella. I'm not a genius. If you persist in thinking I am, you're going to be terribly disappointed. Photographs of the big fair and party, friends, celebrating the opening of the 20th century. Photograph? No, thank you. I've got an idea. Why don't you give a concert of your own in a hall? That's what I want to do, but that takes money. Don't you know some rich person who'd sponsor you? Even if I did, he mightn't consider me a good investment. Oh, silly, you'd be a wonderful investment. Caryl Dubrok- The son of the great composer - Alfred Dubrok. Why, any sensible sponsor would jump at the chance. Grazie mille. I know. Professor Heinrich. Professor Heinrich? Of course. Why didn't we think of him before? Professor Heinrich is not only your friend. he was your father's as well. I'll ask him to arrange a concert for you. He's at home now. No, I'm sure he wouldn't consider me talented enough to bother with. He'd be embarrassed, and so would I. Very well. If you want to be stubborn. I'm not stubborn. It's simply a case of- Then there's only one thing left for us to do, and that is to get married. Married? Of course. Papa and Mama know we're in love. And our marriage would solve everything. How? Don't be silly. The Maclean money And the Dubrok genius. No. No, Fenella. Caryl... What, darling? Don't you want us to be married? You know I do, Fenella. More than anything in the world. That's why I'm saving my money. In a year's time, I'll have saved enough to give a concert in Milan. Then if I'm a success, we- Look here, though, I shan't be able to save anything if we always ride in gondolas. I mean, wouldn't we get to your house sooner if we walked? The canal is so roundabout. I don't want to get home sooner, as you put it. This is Wednesday, you know. Wednesday? Yes. That's why I don't want to go home early. I don't understand. Well, I, Fenella Maclean, am at present residing in the Neroni Palace in Venice, which is a famous city of Italy. All of Venice is famous, and the Neroni Palace is especially famous. It's very old and smelly. It contains on the lower floor priceless paintings and frescoes. The Macleans occupy quarters on the second floor. And on Wednesdays, The public is admitted to the art treasures of the palace. Little barbarians. Giggling females. Good afternoon, Herr Heinrich. Good afternoon. My dear. This schoolgirl visitation gets worse every week. The place is fairly swarming with the little wretches. But it does give the palace a certain atmosphere. You must admit that, Ivor. I don't want atmosphere. I want peace. Here, darling. Drink your tea. And your rehearsals, Herr Heinrich, are they going well? Rather well, yes. But I miss my own orchestra. It will be a relief to get back to London. Let me go. Let go. Let me go. Let me go, or I'll crack your shins for you. Let me go. Giuseppe, who is that young person? It's a thief, Signor Maclean. We found her in the Signorina's bedroom. A thief, huh? Bring her in. Let me alone. Let me alone. Giuseppe, you may wait outside. Oh, stop her. She'll jump in the canal. Yes, I will if you don't let me alone, you ninnies. Why all the fuss? I'm no thief. Then what were you doing in my daughter's room? Oh. Was it your daughter's? She has a lot of clothes, hasn't she? Well? I was hiding. Hiding? From whom? The schoolgirls. Then the teachers began to call roll, and I had to skip. You see, I'm not a schoolgirl. But why did you join them at all? To get something to eat. To eat? Yes. You see, it's this way. These school groups visit the museums and stuffy old places like this. Then afterward, they go to a shop for tea, and I go along and eat with them if they don't find me out first. It's a good arrangement. It works out very well, generally. But you mean you've done this sort of thing before? I do it all the time. But that's stealing. Aha. Someone has been cheating at solitaire. There's a red 8 on a red 9. Cheating a bit at solitaire is quite different from stealing, my girl. Yes, it is. You have no need to cheat at cards. But sometimes, I do have to steal food. Oh, hello. So your present costume was merely put on for the occasion, right? You are a clever old verwandte,aren't you? What does she mean - verwandte? It's difficult to translate, fortunately. Young woman, I shall call the police unless you confine yourself to English and sensible English at that. If you call the police, I shall tell them you cheat at solitaire. Now, then, what is your name? Gemma. Gemma what? Gemma Smith. You don't like Smith? Then my name is Gemma Porloniovsky. However, it's really Smith. But you're English. I was born of an English father and a Hungarian mother on a Dutch ship on the high seas. But as soon as we made port, they put my father in prison. For fathering you? No. For killing a man. What? Yes. And later on, my mother committed suicide. And- and then? Oh... nothing much. Grew up with relatives of my mother. Decided I didn't care for them and ran away. But how did you get to Venice? On a wine cart from Padua. But the driver wasn't a nice man. And as soon as we came to the edge of the city, he kicked me off. And in Venice, what did you do? I went to a hospital, a free one. Oh, were you ill? No. No, I felt fine. But I was having a baby. Perhaps you would like me to tell you about it. Thank you. We shan't go into that. Oh, but the baby is wonderful. I call him Piccolo because he is so little. This, uh, child, did it have a father? What do you think? Certainly, it did. The father was my husband... for a while. He is dead now. Oh, dear. Yes. Well, that's about all. Venice... my baby, me discharged from the hospital with no strength in my bones and no money in my stocking. But it all came out all right. I'm like a cat. I always land on my feet. You know, inside of a day, I'd fainted in the street, and there my friend found me. The baby and I are staying with him for a moment. And this friend of yours, is he- Oh, no. He has no money either. That's why I go about with the schools - to get food for us. This so-called friend, who is he? Young musician. His name is Dubrok. Oh! Yes, he's the son of Albert Dubrok - the composer. A famous father, but the son, weren't a much smaller bush if you ask me. However he might- You may go. You mean it? I do, indeed. Please go at once. Oh, all right. Arrivederci. Thank heavens Fenella wasn't here. By the way, where is she? She... she's out with Mr. Dubrok. Hello, everybody. I have news for you. Oh, I'm so glad you're here, Professor Heinrich. Darling. Mama, papa. Fenella, listen to me. No. You listen to me, Papa. I have a wonderful surprise, and it won't keep. I'm going to marry Caryl Dubrok. Great scott. What did you say? She said she's going to marry Caryl Dubrok. No, darling. You couldn't possibly. The fellow's a scoundrel. We're leaving Venice at once. It's just as well. One can't trust it. You know, the whole idea of fetching a train in a boat is ridiculous. I can't get used to it. How are you? Fenella, I... What's happening? Are your parents going away? Yes. And I'm going with them. You're what? Fenella, come along. I can't marry you, Caryl. But why not? Because of Gemma. Gemma? Gemma? But who is Gemma? Ask Professor Heinrich. Fenella, please wait a moment. Really, I don't know any Gemma. I've never even heard of such a person. You've got to believe me. Fenella... Look, Professor, I don't know any Gemma. I've never even heard of such a person. You've got to believe me. I do. The trouble is the Macleans prefer to believe Gemma. That's why they are taking their daughter out to the Dolomites. The parents would have objected to you in any case. They don't like musicians. Musicians are not practical. They don't make money. Fenella doesn't care about money. Rich people are always saying that, but they don't really mean it. Which way, Signore? Diritto. Diritto? Bene. Listen. Oh, it's an original tune and rather diverting. Why, that's one of my father's things, and that concertina's mine. It is your concertina? Yes. I loaned it to Sebastian in Milan last year. Don't you see? That must be my brother Sebastian playing the concertina up there. Gondolier, stop. The music's coming from that upper window, the one with the white rags hanging out over the ledge. Your so-called white rags are baby napkins, my young friend. What do you mean? They're Gemma's. Gemma, huh? Piccolo, there is positively no boy soprano part in this composition, so shut up! Thank you. I knew it. Oh, hello. Look here, Sebastian- I'm glad you dropped in. There's something I want you to hear. I've got something I want you to hear. Listen. You've upset my applecart again, haven't you? Have I? It must be a very poorly balanced applecart to upset so easily. Besides, how could I? I haven't seen you since Milan. Do you know a girl named Gemma? Also, her brat. He's a cute little fella, isn't he? Mm-hmm. Oh, no, thanks. I create music. It's Gemma's. Would you be so kind as to explain who Gemma is? Certainly. I found her wandering around in the streets one day, sort of starving and so on, you know, so I thought the only humane thing to do was to take her in, so I did. Very noble of you. It certainly was, considering the state of my finances. Uh, by the way- Not a lira. Loaning you money is like feeding straws to a fire. What's that you're whistling? This little song I'm writing. Gemma has got a pretty nice voice. I thought she might sing it some day. Here. Take a look. "Escape Me Never. " Mm-hmm. Words by Browning, With slight additions by Sebastian Dubrok. Escape me never My beloved- While I am I And you are you. Of course, I'm not letting Gemma know she's got voice enough to sing it. You know how women are. Once they begin to think they're important, they get absolutely out of hand. From what I've heard of Gemma, she's already out of hand. Why? Do you know her? No. But she forced her way into the Neroni Palace yesterday, and the palace happens to be in the residence of some friends of mine- Mr. And Mrs. Maclean and Miss Maclean. And your precious Gemma told them she was living with a musician named Dubrok, so naturally, they assumed it was me. They- they thought I- Oh, shut up. Oh, that's very funny. Hey, Gemma. Signore. Is your name Gemma? If it is, you've put on a bit of weight. Gemma. Yeah? Huh? Come on up. Something's happened. Come on up quick. I'll be there in a minute. All right, everybody to the fountain. I'm in a hurry. Come on. You must go now, Signorina. Maybe someday, you will not have to go. That would be nice. All of us here feel the same way. I know I'm older than you, and I'm fat, but perhaps there's other things. If you were my wife, you will have all the bread you want to eat and love and 5 little ones. You think 5 too many? Ah, but everyone must have at least 5, to be happy. You marry me, and you get 5 all at once without no trouble. Signorina, if you could- Dino, can we talk about it later, huh? Antonino. Up. Ah, thank you, Antonino. Thank you. Piccolo. Don't worry. He's all right. Nothing wrong with him. Gemma, hey. Behold my brother - Caryl. The fool of the family, huh? But he's in trouble. You remember that palazzo you went barging into yesterday? Mm-hmm. What about it? The family are friends of Caryl's Ahem, especially the daughter. You have no right to laugh at Fenella. You've never even seen her. Nevertheless, I know exactly what she's like. She's the kind that is always taking cold baths. And she's frightfully keen on croquet, you know, and the only perfume she ever uses is cologne water. Why don't you be quiet? But she has nice gloves - just my size. You stole those gloves from Fenella. Of course. And what if I did? Give them to me. No. You try and get them. Sebastian. No. You know... I like you. Well, I don't like you. How Sebastian can stand having you around I can't, for the life of me, see. I am going. Wait. Is she really your sweetheart? She was until you spoiled it. Aw. I'm sorry. I had no idea you were more than friends with her. I shouldn't have laughed a moment ago. Why don't you just go to this Fenella and knock some sense into her? Being a woman, she'll love you all the more. She's gone. Left Venice, you mean? Yes. Where did she go? To the Dolomites What will you do? I'm going to find her and tell her about you and Sebastian. Bravo. That's the stuff. And I'll go with you. Oh, no, you won't. You better not go alone. I know women. She'll never believe you. You need a witness. The Dolomites, yes. We'll take my concertina and set out immediately. We'll cross valleys, climb mountains, sing for our supper in every swank hotel until you find her. What do you say? But it's not the way to do it. It's not dignified. Digni... Oh... if she had wanted someone dignified, she could have had her pick of them at home. But, no, she took you because you are the opposite sort of person her parents would have chosen for her. Besides, think how pleased she'll be to have you come after her. That's what a woman really wants- to be needed, pursued, made to feel that she's- Oh, what do you know about it? I need a holiday, and the Dolomites are just the place for it. Stop grumbling. It's all settled. Very well. Come along if you've got the money for your train fare. Train fare? What do we need train fare for? We're going a piedi, on foot, shanks' mare. What's the matter with you? Can't you walk? Are you a cripple? All right. Good. Yes, it'll be wonderful. We'll eat wild strawberries with our lunch and sit under the pine trees when we are tired and pick edelweiss and alpenrosen. But you're not coming. Well, what I mean is somebody's got to stay here and take care of Piccolo. After all, this jaunt of ours might be nothing but, well, a wild goose chase. You can't haul a little baby. Don't you think? Caryl, what time is it? Oh, that's the watch father gave you, isn't it? Yes. Mm-hmm. Gold, too, eh? Oh, no, you don't. It's the last valuable thing I own, and I won't part with it. What? Do you mean to tell me that you'd allow a miserable gold watch to stand between you and Fenella? Come on, we're going to need a little dinero, aren't we? I'll pawn it first thing in the morning, and in return, I shall bring you together with Fenella. You shall be wed and go to live in a little green-shuttered house. Of course, there's a hitch. You'll have to make a living for her. I'll expect to. Don't worry. She'll expect you to. Every morning you leave the little house, you'll have an attach case full of contracts and music, and Fenella will be upstairs waving good-bye to you. And then after you have children- Oh, stow it. How do you know so much about my future? Because I know your past. But it'll be a pretty good life for you. Why wouldn't it be a good one for you, as well? My dear, Gemma, Caryl is the nice, dependable sort, solid from tip to toe. I only wish I were like him. I'll bet you do. But I never shall be. I'm what the lady poets call a free spirit. Meaning a selfish pig- about everything but your music. Uh-huh. Ah, but honest about it. Don't you think? Funny little codger, isn't she? Good-bye, Gemma. My little Piccolo, My pupazzetto, I still have you, haven't I? For a while, I have. But in a few years, you'll grow up to be a big strong handsome man, who makes some woman very unhappy. Oh, so sweet. You'll make her happy at first, no doubt, but in the end, it'll be the same story. Yes, it will. Oh, it's all right, yes. It's all right, Piccolo. Yes, it's all right, my Piccolo. I thought Piccolo would have a feather to wake up with. He gets a lot of fun out of it. I suppose you don't like being left behind. I don't mind at all. You shouldn't. You'll be all right here, won't you? Perfectly. But Dino has asked me to marry him. I think I'll do it. You'll what? Marry Dino. In the name of Piccolo? What for? Well, it would be a very good arrangement. I could take care of his children, and he could take care of Piccolo and me. Why, that's absolutely nonsense. I never heard anything so ridiculous. You ought to be pleased to get rid of me. Maybe I should, at that. Very well. Then there's nothing further to discuss. You'll go your way, and I'll go mine. And we shall both be free as we were before... and Dino will be kind to me, much kinder than you've ever been. So, he's been kind to you, has he? Why, that fat bread peddler. I suppose the next thing you'll be telling me, He calls you his coricino. I can hear him now. "Ah, signorina, I love you. " Shut your mouth. I don't understand your wretched Italian. You don't? Then I'll translate it. "Without you, my love... without you on my arm, I cannot live. " But enough. Come to think of it... you don't sing as much through your nose as you used to. You might be useful. Caryl can play the concertina, and you and I can do the singing. But what would I do with Piccolo? Piccolo? Put him in an orphanage. He's not an orphan. Well, all right. I can live with it. Take him along. The mountain air would be good for him. Good for you, too. Wouldn't it? All right. Then it's settled. Dino. Piccolo, Piccolo, We are going with him, yes. Behold- the Dolomites- a region named for the famous french geologist Dolomieu because it was he who made them known to the world. I wish he'd made them less steep. How much farther is it to Orzano? Oh, about a kilometer. Orzano tonight. Tomorrow night, Martino. She may have left Martino. Heinrich's letter said they'd be there until Wednesday. They might have changed their plans. Oh... here. You carry Piccolo for a while. That'll give you something to worry about. Great scott, Piccolo. You're getting heavier every day. Naturally. Look, Sebastian, edelweiss. Isn't it beautiful? Mm-hmm. She loves me. She loves me not. No, don't. You'll ruin it. Oh, come on. You're wasting time. We're not wasting time. We're enjoying ourselves. Don't tease him. He's unhappy without his Fenella. Just because he's unhappy, he wants everybody else to be unhappy. Come along, Monsieur le Duc. We have to find Caryl's lady love. Then he won't be so cross. Come on. Come, follow, follow, follow Follow, follow Follow me... Come, follow, follow, follow Follow, follow, follow me... Come, follow, follow, follow Come, follow, follow me... Come, follow, follow, follow Follow, follow Follow me... Come, follow, follow, follow Follow, follow, follow me Oh, Sebastian, I think we had better find another way. Why? Afraid of getting your feet wet? Go on. Wait until I take my shoes off. Oh! You know, I think it might be deep. Well, you go first, then if you sink, we'll know it is. Come on, come on. Come on, Monsieur le Duc. Shove, Caryl. Pull. Piccolo, Piccolo! What are you trying to do, drown my baby? Piccolo. Aw, Piccolo. Oh. I'm sorry, Caryl. Does it hurt very much? I can walk. It can't be very far now. Gre, fraulein. Gr gott. I wonder if you could tell us, how far is it to Orzano, please? Just a few kilometers. You'll see it around the turn. Uh-huh. And what about lodgings- cheap ones? Oh, there's an inn there that's very cheap and also very good. Just this side of the hotel. Zumkefeldzen, it's called. Well, that's very kind of you, indeed. And may I say that if all the natives of the Dolomites are as charming as you, our travels will be most pleasant? Oh, for heaven's sake, Sebastian. Auf wiedersehen. There it is- big as life and twice as wonderful. Caryl, take this to the landlady and ask her to fill it with warm milk, huh? All right. Oh, don't take that off, Sebastian. It's his good luck charm. This? Mm-hmm. Hey, be careful. That's valuable. Valuable? Yes. It's a composition- my father's, signed by his own hand. Look. Boy, I could sell this for a barrelful of money. Then why don't you. I'm keeping it for something to shoot at. Ah, he was a master of melody - the old man. You do better than that. Hmm? You're a master of everything, but nothing ever masters you. Miss- uh, madam, I think it's just warm enough. Danke schn, frau Huber. I'll take care of your knee in a moment, Caryl. Piccolo, look. Hmm... pretty good... for the price. Sebastian, better get over to the hotel and see if they'll let us sing tonight, huh? All right. Wait until I make myself seductive. Hmm, you must expect the manager to be a woman. No, but he'll probably have a wife. See if the hotel orchestra will help us out. It'll make a better concert. That way, we can expect a fee from the manager on top of what we collect from the guests. Will you remember? Mm-hmm. You know, you two are lucky to have me along. We've landed a concert engagement every night since we left Venice. Don't take all the credit for that. You've had to use Gemma's baby to clinch the deal more than once. Well, how do I look? Uh, like a duke in disguise. What? Only a duke? Wow. Oh, yes, you better wear this tonight. It's quite becoming. It makes you look like a woman. Well, arrivederci, children. And don't forget to keep the door locked. There may be dragons in the forest. Let's see. Yes, it's a bad bruise, all right. Gemma. You think this is going to be too tight, huh? Gemma. You really are in love with him, aren't you? Ah. He's a dreadful man. That girl we met on the bike, he could never expect to see her again, oh, but he had to spread his charm on her like jam on a piece of bread. He does it all the time. He's probably ogling some woman at this very moment. He just can't help it. He's always been like that. Now, you lie down and make yourself comfortable. I have to get Piccolo ready for bed. Women are nothing but parsley to Sebastian. Music, that's his meat. I know. That's the only thing in this whole world that he's really unselfish about. It's a pity you don't care more for music. But I have the baby. You know, Caryl, Piccolo actually belongs to me. He's my music and much more wonderful than anything Sebastian could ever write. I still think it's a pity you don't care more for his music. What difference does it make? Does a wife have to be- I mean a woman- mad about the profession of the man she loves? Is that necessary? No. I suppose not. I could take care of him- cook for him, mend, keep him well, see that he worked when he should. That's important, isn't it? We could be happy together. Except that it wouldn't be fair to you. Sebastian's wife will have a rather unpleasant time of it, I imagine. My dear Caryl, do you expect love to be pleasant? Has it been pleasant for you? Is your Fenella perfect? Practically. Yes. Parsley. I don't even mean that much to him. But... ah, but surely- No. It's not what you think, Caryl. A pat on the head, an occasional hug, absent-minded kiss now and then. That's all that's ever been between us, and it's not enough. I want more than that. I want my share of love. I want him to be my husband. Your brother's a beast. He seems to think I have no feelings whatsoever, no blood in my veins, no need to be happy like other women. I hate him. Caryl, I think you had better stay home tonight with that knee. Then you can take care of the baby for me. All right, if you and Sebastian can manage without me. Of course, we can. Piccolo... did you hear what he said about my dress? You know, he's never really noticed my clothes before. That's because I've never had anything stylish, and I wouldn't have had this time if I hadn't bought the stuff and made it myself. And it'll look even better in the moonlight, because after the concert, we'll walk home together, and I'll take his arm, and perhaps he'll say more nice things, but not about my dress, about me. Perhaps he'll even tell me he's in love with me, huh? We'll see you later. Thank you. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. And now for your pleasure... for your pleasure, a song- "Love for Love. " 'Promise me Love for love And I'm yours Till the end of time Love is a wondrous adventure Something that no one should miss If you want me, darling Take me All that I ask is this Give me love for love Nothing more Nothing less Don't promise me the moon Leave the stars Where they are Give me just your heart Say it's mine Only mine Promise me Love for love And I'm yours Till the end of time. ' Collect now. What? Collect now. But we haven't given them a fair go. Shouldn't we play one or 2 more songs? Go on. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. It was charming, monsieur. Charming. Indeed it was, madam. Charming. Our pleasure, I assure you. Charming. The manager's wife. Of course. Charming. Your pleasure, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Madam, thank you. Thank you. Not there. The old geezer. Oh, boy. Thank you. Oh, thank you, sir. Melvin. Thank you. And you, madam, thank you. Our pleasure. Did you do well tonight? Uh-huh. Pretty well. Aha. You did all right yourself. I don't just mean the money. You were wonderful- singing. Thank you. You're happy tonight, huh? Yes, I am. And do you know something? What? I didn't mind your flirting with that woman. Me? Flirting? What woman? The manager's wife. Oh. The manager's wife. We got to be nice to people like that. After all, they're our bread and butter. Yes, I know, but, Sebastian, we wouldn't even have to bother with them if you'd settle down and write- and I know you can- really good music. Gemma, darling, to write really good music, you've got to be... inspired. Inspired? Yes. By a place, by somebody. Somebody? Look, a falling star. Make a wish. Aw. Too late. Yes, it generally is too late. But if you had seen it, what would you have wished for? Well, what would you have wished for? Me? Ooh, a nice cold glass of beer. How about you? Oh, I don't know. A pair of new shoes or a woolly for Piccolo. Piccolo needs if a new woolly, buy one. We can afford it. Thanks, Sebastian. And Caryl- if he'd seen that falling star, he would have wished for the lovely Fenella. Oh, that reminds me. I must collect our fee from the hotel manager in the morning. Then we can go on to Martino. Sebastian. Hmm? Hmm? Then we can go on to Martino. Yes. Did you really think my dress looked attractive tonight? Very... very attractive. Maledetto. I forgot my concertina. Well, is that important now? Well, certainly, it's important. Someone might pinch it. I better go and get it. Look, you go along and I'll join you, hmm? All right? Huh? Go on. Oh. Good evening. Please don't think me rude. But I couldn't help noticing you back there on the terrace. I said to myself, I've seen that face somewhere before. Possibly Innsbruck. Was it? I've never been to Innsbruck. Sorry. Oh. Monte Carlo, perhaps. Don't you think this talk of seeing me before is a little old-fashioned? Frankly, yes. Well, would you be more willing to believe me if I admit that I've never seen your face before, but once having seen it, I had to see it again? If I say yes, I'd be a bit conceited, don't you think? No. Really, I must be going in now, but thank you for the charming compliment. Oh, please don't go, not just yet. I hate to repeat the obvious, but... you are beautiful. There's something so cool and lovely about you. You're like... well, you're like edelweiss. Yes, that belongs on you. Will you wear it? Satisfied? Thank you. You know, I think every woman's a little bit like a flower, don't you? Some are like roses, some, poppies. but you- you're like edelweiss, preferring the mountaintops, hard to reach. That girl who sang, what of her? Oh, you mean my professional partner? She's like a little buttercup. You do have a way with words, don't you? You think so? I think I have a way with music. You're a very talented fellow, aren't you? Oh, very. Tell me, do you like music? I adore it. Oh? Good music or just concertina? Any kind that's really good- symphony, opera. Why? I do a bit of composing now and then, that's all. Really? How amazing. Seeing you here at the hotel like this, I should never have taken you for a composer. Well, even composers have to eat. Look at that. Beautiful, isn't it? Yes. Tell me about your music. What kind of music is it? Would I have heard it? I'm really interested. Do you know what you look like, standing there in the moonlight? A picture I once saw in Florence by Botticelli. The Goddess of Spring- in the Woods, I think. I know the one you mean - Primavera. That's the one. Primavera - what a wonderful name for a ballet. That's marvelous. I can see the whole thing now- the symbol of Spring. You, you're Primavera yourself. I am? Listen. That's the theme. Do you like it? Oh, yes. It must be terribly exciting to do things like that- be able to create something out of the air. I never could. You don't need to. Some people are born to inspire. I really mean it. I knew that it was no mere coincidence that sent me to seek you out tonight. Do you believe in destiny? I don't know. I never did until now. I'd better get back to the hotel. No. Not until you tell me your name. Primavera. Very well, then. Don't go yet, Primavera. I should. Please. Well, all right. But only for a few minutes. Can you tell me where the manager is, please? His office is just upstairs, to the left. Oh, Miss Maclean, if you please. A letter for you... Oh? Perhaps the one you have been expecting. Thank you. Uh, Fenella. Oh, yes? How do you know my name? Well, Caryl told me. What did you say? I'm Gemma. What are you doing here? I thought you were staying in Martino. I'm spending the weekend with friends if it's any of your concern. So you're Gemma Smith. That's right. I have some news for you. Caryl is here. What? Yes, in Orzano. Caryl Dubrok? Well, do you know any other Dubroks? He's here with you. In a manner of speaking, yes. Now, listen... I'm not Caryl's girl. I never was. But you told my parents- It was a bit of a crisscross. I meant Sebastian, not Caryl. Sebastian? Who is he? Caryl's brother. Ha ha ha! Sebastian! I have a wonderful surprise for you. Fenella, this is Sebastian. Sebastian, this is Fenella. How do you do? You- you're- Sebastian, Caryl's brother. Oh! Another raffle card, eh? Which is Miss Maclean's room, please? Number 5. Thank you. What do you mean by coming into my room like this? Sorry. Please go. I have nothing further to say to you. Oh, yes, you have. Look, we've been hunting for you for weeks on end, sleeping in the rain, bruising our feet on stony roads, just because we wanted to straighten it out with you about Caryl and me, and now when we do find you and things are apparently in a worse mess than ever, you climb on your high horse and- Sebastian gave you this. You have no right to take that. No one has a better right. Are you Sebastian's wife? No. What, then? We belong together. Then why did he assure me you were only his professional partner, someone to sing tunes to his concertina? Oh, that. What about Caryl? Do you love him? Certainly I do. We were engaged to be married. That was in Venice. How about afterward? Did you change toward him? Naturally I did, after my parents told me about you. Any girl would have. No, some girls would have believed in him, no matter what they heard. But that's neither here nor there. Do you still love him? I told you I did! But did you mean it? Get out of here! You are mixed up. You don't know whether it's Caryl or his brother you want, do you? Well, which is it, then? Caryl or Sebastian? Answer me. I don't know. Will you stop pestering me? I tell you, I don't know! I- I don't know. I know. What a pity. Where's Caryl? Gone to meet Fenella I presume. He was getting dressed when I left the inn. Did you tell him about you and Fenella last night? What would have been the sense of that? Well, what did you tell him? Simply that we'd met her in the lobby of the hotel. I said that she was waiting for him in the summer pavilion. Then you did have an appointment with her. Did Caryl know about that? Of course, he didn't know about it. And why don't you stop badgering me? I had no idea it was Fenella last night. I wonder if it would have mattered if you had known. Oh, for heaven's sake, Gemma, why are you holding Piccolo on your hip like that? It looks like an old sack of potatoes you bought at the market. Here. Give him to me. He's too heavy for you to lug around anyway. Now, if you'd care to listen, I'll explain how I met Fenella. Last night- We haven't time to go into that. Sebastian, I want to talk to you very seriously. Oh. Go ahead. Who's stopping you? We're leaving Orzano. Leave- why? When? Today. We'd have to see a lot of Caryl and Fenella if we stayed on, and I think that'd be a little embarrassing. All right. We'll go back to Venice. We are not going to Venice. What- oh. Afraid the Maclean's might be going back there, aren't you? We'll go to Vienna. I don't like Vienna. Then we'll go to Paris. I don't like Paris, either! Besides, you know we haven't got the money. Oh, yes, we have. I sold the concertina and... the duke. You so- ha ha ha! The concertina belonged to Caryl, and so did half the donkey. Getting rid of you and me will be worth more to him than a concertina and half a donkey. Oh, why don't you stop- Women. I also sold your father's autographed music. You did what? Sold your father's autographed music. Why, you- you little runt. You've certainly got a nerve. Well, instead of carrying other people's stuff around, you should be writing great things of your own. Yes. That's what I'm going to do... beginning with Primavera. What? Oh, I haven't told you about that, have I? That's to be the name of my ballet. What ballet? It's a brand- new idea, wonderful, symbolizing the very spirit of Spring. Primavera. Listen. Oh, I'm sorry, Gemma. Oh, I wish we could go away somewhere where I could get this down on paper so it could be staged. You'd help me, wouldn't you? Gemma? Hmm? The way you always have? Are you bawling? If I am, it's my affair. It's mine, too. Sebastian, I've known a lot of rotten people in my life, but none the equal of you. You lie and cheat and break promises right and left and then think because you put your arms around me, everything's all right, Forgiven and forgotten. Wait a moment. I- You're rotten. I say it again, and I say it to your face. I have a star to follow, I've always told you, and I must follow it alone. What you follow isn't a star. They don't come that low. But whatever it is, go after it. I'm finished. What do you mean by that? I'm leaving you, Sebastian. Gemma! Gemma! Put Piccolo down. Put him down! Now, come here. You little fool. Oh, if I could only tell you how thoroughly I despise you, then up and leave you, let it be finished once and for all. It'll never be finished between us. Gemma, you know it won't. Loving you is the most awful thing that has ever happened to me. Is it? Yes, it is. Perhaps you're right. Maybe you do deserve a better man. But I don't want a better man, Sebastian. I just want you. Fenella. Oh, Fenella, darling, you're looking wonderful. I've never seen you so- so beautiful. Thank you, Caryl. You didn't expect me to follow you to the Dolomites, did you? No. Oh, it doesn't seem any longer than yesterday we were sitting in the Caf Galante. I feel as if there had never been a misunderstanding at all. I know how you feel, but- I say, Gemma explained the mix-up in Venice, didn't she? Yes. She explained very thoroughly. Well, everything's the same, and yet everything's changed since I saw you last. Yes. That's what I want to talk to you- I have a surprise for you. I've come round to your way of thinking. How do you mean? About our getting married, of course. Oh, Caryl! Yes. I think it would be a good thing. And to make myself acceptable to your parents, I'm going to get a job. Oh, not the sort of thing I had in Venice, but something with a future and, at the same time, something which will further my career. I know it sounds rather vague, but I'm positive I can work it out. What do you think? Oh, I... I don't know. Where would you find such a job? Oh, lots of places - Vienna, Salzburg, perhaps London. Yes. London would be best, I imagine. My father had a great many friends there. A music broker by the name of Steinach to name just one. He'd be a good contact for me. Would you marry me if I had a proper job, Fenella? Well- I can make you happy, darling. I know I can. Oh, Caryl, I don't know how to say this, but there's something I've got to tell you. Last night, I- Excuse me. Mr. Caryl Dubrok, please? Yes. What is it? I have a note for you, sir. Oh, thank you. Excuse me. It's from Sebastian, my brother. Oh? Good heavens. He and Gemma are leaving for London. London? Yes. He intends to finish his ballet. He says at last he's got a name for it. It's to be called Primavera. Primavera. They're getting married right away. Oh, that's wonderful. Well, that's just like Sebastian. One never knows what to expect of him. Now, what was it, darling? You said you had something to tell me. It was nothing, nothing at all. So Sebastian's getting married. Do you, Sebastian Dubrok, take this woman Gemma Smith to be your lawful wedded wife? I do. And do you, Gemma Smith, take this- And do you, Gemma Smith, take this man Sebastian Dubrok to be your lawful wedded husband? I do. Then I pronounce you man and wife. Won't you buy my sweet-scented lavender? There are 14 branches for a penny. If you buy it once, you buy it twice 'cause it makes your clothes and handkerchiefs smell very nice. I'll take a bunch, please. Thank you, sir. Won't you buy my sweet-scented lavender? Caryl! I ought not to be glad to see you. You have lunch with Sebastian time after time, but you never once come to visit me. Time after time. Only twice. Those lunches were business. Oh, you have a new suit. Let me see. My, you are turned out in style. Look, Sebastian. Well, I can afford it now. My job with Steinach pays me 200 a year, And besides that, I get commissions. Oh, that's wonderful. How is Fenella? Oh, splendid. We're planning to be married very soon. Well, well. Congratulations. I'll congratulate you if you've licked that finale. Oh, yeah? Hmm. It looks good. Well, now I have a surprise for you. Have you? A pleasant one, I hope. Fenella and her family are giving a party next Friday, And you're both invited. Oh, really? Well, it's Fenella's doing, actually. She's asked Mr. Steinach to come on the idea that you're to play your ballet for him. If he likes it, he'll probably offer to produce your Primavera. You could use Heinrich as conductor and perhaps Natrova as the prima ballerina. That is, if we can get her. Caryl! Good old Caryl. We can always rely upon you. Little one, I'm going to take you to a party, at last. Yes. It'll be wonderful. And if the ballet is a success, we can all go back to Italy. If it's a success. - Confound that gas. It's always going out. Here. I have some change. Oh, put it back in your pocket. We don't need your money. Gemma, put a shilling in the meter, will you, darling? Don't know what I'd do without her and that little sewing machine. Between the 2 of them, they support the 3 of us. Where is it? Huh? Oh, I wonder if I spent it. Mmm, for beer. Oh, yes. The beer. There you are, Gemma. Thank you, Caryl. Well, I guess I'd better be running along. Oh, would you, uh, like these? Oh, thank you, Caryl. I have some Mexican jumping beans. I thought they might amuse Piccolo. Hmm? They jump as soon as they get warm. They won't do much jumping in here. This place is like an icebox. It was very thoughtful of you, Caryl. Piccolo will love them. All right. I'll see you two at the party. If the baby is all right and I can leave him. He'll be all right. Just got a bit of a cold. No, Sebastian. Not a penny. Oh, for heaven's sake, Gemma, will you stop stitching those cuffs? You're going to sew yourself blind. Well, when I finish these, I get 12 shillings we can use it, I imagine. Oh, Sebastian! Look. A 5-pound note! Uh-huh. Mutton chops for supper. Did you sponge this off Caryl? If I did? What he's solvent. He can afford it. And there's not going to be any mutton chops. You're going to buy yourself a new dress for the party. No. I can use my blue one. Oh, no, I can't. What? I didn't pawn your blue dress. No, but I did. Oh. Well, we'll... buy a new one. I tell you, I can borrow one from the landlady's daughter. That's a good idea. Yes, the pretty one. She's just about your size. And by way of reward, we shall allow her to take care of Piccolo while we go to the party. You have a nerve. Oh, go on. Hurry up. Hurry up! Amore mio. It was beautiful, Sebastian. Very good, my boy. Thank you, Mr. Steinach. I must talk this over with your brother. Fine. Thank you, sir. You look lovely, my dear. You may tell the dance orchestra to start now. Yes, madam We shall have supper later. Oh, you are very kind. Not at all, my dear. May I have the pleasure of dancing with you, Mrs. Dubrok? Oh, thank you very much. Rather odd having to call you missus. You don't look to have a husband, you know. Oh, sometimes I wonder if I have. I suppose wives do wonder about that at times. I beg your pardon. Oh, no, no. It was my fault. I don't dance very often. I wish Fenella didn't dance so much. She's out practically every night with her young man. Never spends the evening in anymore. Oh? Restless sort of girl, but marriage will settle her, I suppose. At least, I hope so. Well, then why don't you let them get married? Huh? Well, why not? You may be right. By jove, yes. I think I'll speak to her young man about it, tell him it's time to dust off the wedding bells. I say, you're a smart little thing, aren't you? Oh, I wouldn't be too sure of that. Primavera is going to be a marvelous success, Sebastian. Of course, I never had any doubts about it, not even that first night when you whistled the theme for me. Then you do remember Orzano. Did you think I'd forgotten? Frankly, I didn't think much about it one way or the other. Bad business, thinking. What do you mean? Simply that the worst mistake anyone can ever make in life is taking it seriously. It's too unpredictable, too haphazard. But you're a musician, and music is based on order and purpose. That's exactly why I am a musician. I pursue art to help me forget that life is not worth pursuing. Surely you believe that it's wanting things and getting them that brings us happiness. No. Who knows what they want? Do you? Yes. Of course, I do. Then you're one of the rare exceptions- A woman who knows what she's after. Not only that, but I always get what I'm after. You do? Then you're a very fortunate girl. I don't see it that way at all. My life is nothing but a flat, stale vacuum. I hate it, and I loathe it. And... if you changed it, would it make you any happier? Yes. Are you sure? You'd better be. Once you've made the break, it might be difficult to get back. But I shouldn't want to get back. Never? Never. Sebastian! Sebastian, I have a note. Piccolo is ill. I think we ought to go home. Would you try and find a cab? I'll get your things. Well, good night. Fenella. Fenella, I want to talk to you. Yes? This is very different from Orzano, isn't it? You are engaged to Caryl, and Sebastian- Please take your foot away. You know, you aren't the first distraction we have had. There have been others. But, you see, once Sebastian makes a conquest of this sort, he forgets it. You're being spiteful, and you completely misinterpret our relation. Oh, do I? Yes. Sebastian is going to be famous. He's not an ordinary man. You are so right. He's an utterly selfish, cold-hearted pig. Don't you know that he's a genius? I ought to. He's always telling me so. Would you mind my speaking frankly? Haven't you been? Gemma, give him up. So that you can have him? Yes. There's so much I could do for him, Just as I've already helped him. Oh, have you? Yes. I gave this party so that he could meet Steinach. I persuaded Heinrich to conduct his ballet. I- I even inspired Sebastian to write the ballet in the beginning. He got the idea for it in Orzano the night we met. So, you see, if you were to give him up, I- Don't say that again. Very well. But you must realize that no woman can hold a man like Sebastian if he doesn't want to be held. What do you mean by that? Suppose he were to leave you. Leave me? Never. I've got a cab at the side gate. Thank you. Darling, I have good news for you. Your father suggests we be married early next Spring. Isn't that wonderful? My dress is torn. I must go in and change. Did you tell her? Yes. Good. Then it's settled. And so's your brother's ballet, I understand. What? Heinrich says that they're going to start rehearsals immediately. No, no. That curtain is 2 bows late. All right, lads. This is a quick change. Now, come on, ladies. Off the bloomin' stage. Take your limes off, Fred. Take up your tableau curtain. Charlie, douse your foots. Fred, turn off your limes. Now, come on, lads. Get a move on. Props! What'd you think of it? Oh, it's splendid. The orchestration is very effective. Yeah? Thanks. Sebastian. 5 minutes, gentlemen. I wish it were your ballet instead of Sebastian's. You could write a ballet if you really applied yourself. I told you in Venice that I wasn't a genius, Fenella. I had my heart set on you doing something really important in music I haven't given it up. I've merely exchanged composing for a steady job. You're so utterly different from Sebastian. He cares nothing for money. I wish you wouldn't keep dragging Sebastian into this. He has nothing to do with it. Or has he? Sebastian's like his father- a great, cruel, wind of a man that no one can leave alone... that women apparently never want to leave alone. I resemble our mother- solid and proper and dull. There are times, Caryl, when I'm inclined to agree with you. Fenella. Well? If you have made a mistake about us, now is the time to say so. Are you trying to break our engagement? I am, if it needs to be broken. We can't talk here. The next scene's about to begin. Stop it! Stop it! It's impossible! It cannot be done! But why? You've been doing it that way for the last 2 weeks. Well, in short shirts, yes, but today is the first time in a long dress. All right. Change to short skirts. How can I? The role calls for a long, full costume. If anything is to be changed, it is your music, Monsieur Dubrok. I hope you're not serious. Professor Heinrich. Madame Natrova, if you would, perhaps- May I make a suggestion? Yes. What is it? I was thinking that perhaps something of Tchaikovsky might be used at this point. But Tchaikovsky! That's wonderful! His music is always good. Don't you think so, Monsieur Dubrok? Certainly, madam, yes. No one appreciates Tchaikovsky more than I, but not in my ballet. This is my music, and it's going to remain my music! I tell you, it cannot be danced! The tempo is too fast, too exhausting, and just when I must catch my breath before the finale! What about a slower tempo, Sebastian? What? What do you want me to do, change a Spring waltz into some sort of funeral dirge? Nonsense I have spent weeks on my solo. It must be done my way or not at all! Excuse me. Would you tell Mr. Dubrok I would like to speak with him, please? I can't go out there now, miss. Yes, but my baby is very sick. Please. I'm sorry, miss. All right. If she can't dance it, let's get someone who can! People come to see Natrova, not to listen to the music of an unknown composer. If they'd sooner watch some kangaroo hop around the stage- Enough of this! Both of you! I'm finished! We are dismissed! We are dismissed! Sebastian- Don't you realize what this will mean? The posters are all ready. Some of them are up. Well, take them down, burn them, do anything you want with them. I don't care. Don't argue with him. It's useless. Sebastian, Sebastian, please come home with me. The baby is very sick, and I'm so frightened. Is he? Well, get a doctor for him. But how can I? We have no money. Darling, please, please, don't you see I've got so much on mind? I've got to have time to think. I must talk to you, Sebastian. Caryl, I was right, wasn't I? That stupid, preening woman With her ridiculous airs and- It's not the ballet I want to discuss at the moment. Oh? What is it? It's Fenella. Fenella? Doesn't anybody care about the music? At least I expected you, a musician- You're in no position to force issues. You behaved like a fool. Thanks. Thanks very much. Don't let them do anything to your music, Sebastian. Fenella. Why did you stay? Well, I... I thought there might be something I can do. Did you? How nice of you. There isn't. I'm not engaged to Caryl anymore. Oh, but that's silly. Caryl's a wonderful fellow. What happened? Please let's not talk about him. I wish I could get away. I hate London. So do I. I wish I could get away somewhere, too, somewhere where I could pull myself together and- I know a place, in the country. Do you? Where? Down in Kent. It belongs to my family. It's lovely- quiet and... Is it? Here we go. He's coming now, darling. Shh. How is he? Mrs. Cooper gave me some medicine, and he's quieter now. That's good. You shouldn't let it upset you so much. Babies always have earaches or something like that. Sorry I blew up like that at rehearsal Oh, that's all right. Now that you're home, I'm not so frightened. That's the last time I'll ever write a ballet, I swear. But, Sebastian, there's money in it. And when they do pay you for the ballet, do you think we could use some of it for- well, to get some warm things for Piccolo? He just can't stand this cold climate. Fat chance there is of them paying me anything. You mean they won't pay you? Oh, but, Sebastian, that can't be. The ballet might not go on at all. Oh, don't worry about it. Something will turn up. It always does. I wonder. I had to do it. There comes a point when one more compromise would have ruined the music. That point was reached this afternoon. Well, that's that. No ballet, no money. Money's not that important. Not to you, perhaps. What do you want me to do, hack work? If so, you're going to be very disappointed. You always seem to be complaining. Because I don't make you a fortune, I suppose- Oh, it isn't that, Sebastian. The baby's sick, and I'm tired, and I don't consider a shilling for the gas meter a fortune. What are you doing with those clothes? I've got to go down to Surrey tonight. Why? To see Natrova, make her listen to reason. She's down there, staying with friends. But you said everything was over with the ballet and finished. Exactly. That's why I have to go down and see her. You said yourself you wanted the ballet to go on, didn't you? Don't lie to me, Sebastian. You're not going down there to talk to Natrova. I know you too well. What do you mean by that? You know exactly what I mean. No, I don't, but I do know one thing - I'm getting out of here. So you were going down to Surrey to talk to Natrova, were you? Yes, I was! You liar! I know who you were going to see- Fenella, and don't try to deny it. Well, go on. Get out of here. I don't need you. Go to her. Let her tell you what a genius you are! Wait a minute. You'll ruin that, you little fool. That's yours as much as it is mine. Mine? It's never been mine! It belongs to Fenella. You wrote it for her. That night in Orzano, you got the idea for it, remember? Well, go on. Take your precious ballet to her. And I hope I never set eyes on it, or you again, as long as I live! You mean that? Yes. Yes, I do! Now, get out of here! Get out! Get out. Who is it? Caryl. Oh. Caryl, would you mind putting a shilling in the gas meter, please? Where's Sebastian? He's gone. When will he be back? He won't. I'm sorry, Gemma. What was it you wanted to talk to him about? Fenella and I have broken our engagement. Oh. Piccolo! Piccolo! Oh, Caryl! Mrs. Cooper! Mrs. Cooper! Yes. What is it? Please, Piccolo is terribly sick. I know he is. Would you try and do something? Do you think a little warm oil in his hair might help? I think you ought to take him to the hospital, ducky. They'd know what to do with him there. That sounds like good advice, Gemma. Yes, but I'd have to stay there with him. You see, he just couldn't stand it with a lot of strange people. Don't worry. I'll go with you. Nothing could happen to him, could it, Caryl? He's so little. It just wouldn't be fair. Thank you, Mrs. Cooper. He is quiet now. Do you think he's a little better? You should have brought him sooner. Oh, yes, I know, but- There's nothing we can do now. Well, then give him back to me. I will take care of him. It's too late. No. That's a lie, a dirty, hospital lie! Give him back to me! Give him back to me, do you hear? That's a lie! Give him back to me! It's a lie! It's a lie! He'll be all right, Caryl. He'll be all right. It's just this awful English weather. As soon as he gets better, I'm going to take him back to Italy, where there's sun. That's all he needs... because back in Italy, he was well and happy all the time. And in Venice, he was... in Venice, he was... come on. Let me buy you a cup of coffee. You're- you're cold. A cup of coffee, please. Here you are, sir. You know, back in Venice, I was going to marry Dino. Dino was a baker. We would have had all the bread we needed. Caryl, you must marry. You must marry Fenella and be very happy and live in a little warm house, and every morning when you go to work, you will leave your little house, and you will have an attach case full of music and contracts, and Fenella will wave good-bye to you from the window- Please, Gemma- Oh, Caryl, please don't let her go. Bring her back. Marry her and never leave her... because people have to be families. There has to be a mother and a father, And the father has to go to work and the children go to school, and then the children come home, and they play. Oh, Piccolo! Piccolo! Gemma! Gemma! Gemma! Gemma! 2 bottles? 2 people. Oh, not tonight. Hey, I'll be needing that. Tonight's too precious. Later on, you'll bring me back that bottle with your own little hands. Oh? Why should I? You'll see. To us. All the people who like us and all the ones who don't. Drink up. It'll help. Oh, it was so cold and strange on the way down here. Let's go and sit by the fire. Yes. It's burning nicely, isn't it? What do you see in the fire? Coal. Oh, don't you see us? I do, the way we're going to be, perhaps in this very house. It'll be mine one day, you know. Will it? Nice... parties, rooms full of flowers and music, nice people. Oh, nice. Will you stop using that stupid word? I'm sorry. I didn't mean it, darling. Oh, everything's going to be wonderful, isn't it? No more poverty for you, no worry, no Gemma. Let's leave Gemma out of it. Out of it? Of course. I quite like Gemma. I think she has a lot of good in her. Some of these girls have. What girls? Well, her sort. Father says that every genius has some little creature like that in his past because when he's starving in a garret, he has to have someone cheap. Of course, they don't understand about his art or his career, but they're useful. Useful... loyal... unselfish... forgiving. Why are you doing them up again? Because I'm taking you home, my dear. So... You're angry. No. Grateful. Look at me. Even the most selfish pig may have... may have something he won't face, even though it's the only decent thing that ever happened to him. I was afraid. That's it. I was afraid to admit what Gemma meant to me because, I suppose, I wanted to go on being a selfish pig. Sebastian, you mean you brought me down here- And that's the luckiest thing that ever happened to you... because I'm taking you back, to Caryl. Caryl- he's your kind of man. And Gemma- Gemma's my kind of woman. Look, Fenella, you're a sensible girl. What you want is a nice marriage, a nice husband- Now you're using that word "nice. " Ha ha ha! I'll give it to you, for a wedding present. Friends? Please? Good friends. Where's Gemma? She's gone. The baby died while you and Fenella... Good evening. Oh, it's going to be a great success, Sebastian. Any word from her? Nothing. I've looked all over London. I'm so sorry. Good luck tonight. Gemma! Gemma! Gemma. I hoped you'd come. I don't want to talk to you. Please- They're going to start. Let me go. Let me go! Gemma! Gemma, wait. Please. Gemma, I don't know what to say. Say nothing. It's better. I didn't know about Piccolo. Don't tell me you're sorry, Sebastian. Be like you always were - not sorry about anything. I wasn't going to say that I'm sorry. That's such a- such a small word. It's so easy for people to be sorry, but no one can tell what it means to a mother to lose a child, because she's the only one who understands, who can imagine the kind of man he was going to grow up to be. I loved the little fellow, too, Gemma, in my own way. Oh, Sebastian... listen. Your music. Yours, too. I could never have written it without you. You know that, don't you? No. Don't lie to me, not at a time like this. I'm not. Look. I wrote it for you long ago, in Venice. It's your song. You're hurt. When we get home, I'll... I'll try to change. Perhaps- perhaps in time, I'll be a better man. But I don't want a better man, Sebastian. I just want you.
