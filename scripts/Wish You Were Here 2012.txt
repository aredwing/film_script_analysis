You can go anywhere you want and you can have anything your heart desires... ...but you can never leave. You're going to have to stay there forever. Forever? It's fun it's like the ultimate fantasy. I'd stay here then. Really? - In Sihanoukville? - Yeah, definitely. I mean maybe not in Sihanoukville exactly but... ...but yeah, maybe somewhere in southeast Asia. Sure.

Thank you. - Hey Margie. - Hello Dave. Look at you come here kiss me! Daddy I miss you. How are ya? Aw I missed you guys! Give me a kiss on the cheek. How are you? Lots of dinosaurs came and... Wanted more water than the big ones... ...so the big dinosaur ate the baby one up and then spat the little one out and put his foot on the little one. - That sounds a bit mean really the big one. Doesn't it? - Do you know what kind of dinosaur that was? No. - Do you think it was a Brontosaurus? - No. - Was it was it...a Prenocefale? - No! - Not a Prenocefale? Do you think it was a Do-you-think-he-saw-us? Or I tripped over and Now-my-leg-is-sore-us? - No - Daddy that's a bit of a silly one. So first of all I'm pretending to chew a chocolate bar like this. ...and then you say "what you have got there?" What you got there? And then I say... ...a chocolate bar. And then you say "where did you get it?" Where did you get? ...and then I say "donkey dropped it". - That's a bit yucky. - Yeah That's a good joke, Holly. - Who wants to hear my joke? - Me Yeah? - Knock, knock! - Who's there? A Dinosaur Goes. - A Dinosaur Goes who? No a dinosaur goes ROAR! - That's a genuinely funny one. - I think I really scared them. - Did you have a bit of a fright, Max? - No. thinking of you xx - Are you watching this bar babe? It's nearly 9 o'clock - Yeah, yup I'm on it! Go on you two. Are you awake? Yeah I kept thinking maybe I should have stayed there with her. Hmm I think what we should do is we should go down to the pool... ...and we'll just have a take a look around ourselves... ...and if we see that shark... ...guess what? We're gonna do our lesson on another day Yeah Are you gonna go and grab your goggles? So we can go? Good boy sweetie. Okay, because it's irrelevant. I'm serious. Just leave it al... - Everything OK? - Yup What time will you be back? No news? Uh that was... Get your backpacks on and I'll meet you outside OK? We'll go to the backdoor. Don't know babe about 1:00, 1:30. You gonna go to the workshop? Or... Uh I've got a pile of stuff to do here today. Alright well, good luck. See you later. - Have fun - Bye. Say bye to daddy. Bye Dad. - See you. - Bye. See you mate! I'm here. Can you...yeah... Calm down. Calm down. Okay, glasses off. Thank you. Just...chin up. Smile if you like. - Hey ah... I've got a... - Here! Hey Jeremy you're looking good there. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Eh? - What are you do... Turn it off... Happy Birthday ...apple and you can be... - A strawberry - Yes! Um...a little mango. Uh the party was the night of the 17th so we'll be hearing tonight And...you know, everyone still actually really positive. Apparently 99% of these cases the person turns up again within 2 weeks. But where would he go? Guys. We just...We just don't know...about... None of it really makes very much sense. His...His passport is still there at the resort... - Uh his bank account hasn't been touched... - Max - You know, I speak to Steph most days - Holly! - ...and she's coping as well... - Come here please. - ...Listen there are adults here trying to have a conversation Can you please take it inside? We are inside. Don't be smart with me. Come on just do as you're told. - You said they're still looking for him, right? - Yeah - Was he depressed? Do you think? - No...no no no. Yeah the local police are and they're doing everything they can as far we can tell...uh...Foreign Affairs has spoken to us a couple of times... I know they've contacted Interpol. Uh is everyone alright? - Tess? - I'm alright mate. Sorry, we didn't want to ruin the lunch for everybody. - No. - We just felt we should tell you...cause you know... - Has everyone had enough to eat? - Yes. Absolutely! Goodbye! Thanks for coming. - Look at you you're such a shark. You're such a cheater and I want a rematch. You alright babe? Are You Lost, Mister? Dave, your phone! Steph. Alice? Here we go. Here we go. Are you ready? - He's out. - Doesn't matter. I'm out! You have nothing. He was totally bluffing you. - I'm gonna watch you. - I knew you were bluffing. There's nothing... I can't stand it here anymore. I know look, just...have you spoken to Mum yet? I'm coming home tomorrow. What? They're scaling the whole thing down anyway. They've put me on a plane for tomorrow night - Who? - The group tour. I don't want to leave here without him. It's gonna be alright... ...it's gonna be alright. - Are you guys ready? - Let's do it! Come on. They've got no respect for women. They treat me like I'm a criminal. They're fucking useless and all lazy. ...and I can guarantee you it would be such a different story if you had money to line they're fucking fat greasy palms. Fuck. Hasn't been anything in the papers has there? Oh I know it's alright. I really think we have to say something to Foreign Affairs. If they know that there's drugs involved they're going to drop the whole thing. We tell them we don't want anyone over there to know. Look... ...I know we talked about this but... It's got nothing to do with drugs. You know that? How do you know that? Steph? Maybe he couldn't get rid of them all. He ended up taking more than we thought. I'm really tired Alice. Don't you think? None of us knows who he spoke to that night. or that week even. I mean he seemed to be friends with just about anybody. I really think we owe it to him now to be honest about everything. This has just gone on way too long. Steph? Can I come to your place? Oh hun... I'm running really late for work. Oh can you drop me off? Please. I don't know she didn't want to see her flat mates Shit! Anyway, look... I really need you to pick up the kids... I'm really going to have to make up some time here. It's okay, babe? Wait how long did she say she wanted to stay for? Uh I don't know as long as she wants. Hi, June, hello. You go in. I'll be in in one moment. OK. Anyway look I would really rather she was going to be with us if it's going to make it any easier for her. Uh well why couldn't she stay at your Mum's? Uh Dave, come on. Don't be like that she's had a really rough time over there. Just tell me are you going to be able to pick the kids up or not? Dave? She was upset? Eh? What? I'm just asking how was she? As you'd expect she's upset. She's all over the place. But look I'm really going to have to go. Um just can you can you give me a yes or a no? Can you grab the kids otherwise... Yeah I'll pick them up. I'll pick them up. Okay, cool! Love you! Bye. I'm so sorry about that. - Hello everybody! - Hello Work. Point!

Last seen by friends dancing at a party in the small southeast coastal town of Sihanoukville early on November the 17th. An area undergoing a... Why are you here? ...acting like nothings happened? Why are you here? Well I'm stuck over there having to answer they're fucking questions. You weren't even returning my phone calls... I understand but your idea was...

I'll go now. Mom, I know, I know, I'm sorry. Get your stuff you're not staying here. - Oh you're a fucking coward! - Stay with you Mum. He's fine he forgot.

She's...she's upset. - What's happened? - Nothing Al, look l... Steph? I'll be back in ten okay? I don't want to do this anymore. Do what? - Hey I...look...what...why don't you... - Don't! What's going on? I don't know. If you don't tell her I will. Tell me what? Guys come on you're scaring me. Dave. I was going to tell you Al when once everything had settled down. But um... Something happened. The night of the party in Sihanoukville... After you went to sleep... What happened Dave? What happened? We slept together. We were crazy drunk and... - It didn't mean anything Al. - I'm sorry. We were just wasted and we were dancing... Steph, Steph. I'm sorry. I promise you that I was... Fuck! You'd better go. - Good job. - I think you would look really good in this. What? Wow check it out! Sexy! That's weird it kind of actually works with your outfit. - Oh please! - It does. - My God we're going to have to buy this. - That's him. - He's cute. - Yeah he's cute! - Don't - he's going to see you. - Sorry. OK. Hi. Anyway he's going to pay it because he works over there a bunch and he can just write it off on tax or whatever. Wow! Like you should just come. God, what is the big problem it is a week. That's it. We're just going to hang by the pool and we're going to sun tan. No phones. No kids. - No money. Mortgage. School fees next year. - It is cheap there. You so...have you every been there? It's like... ...dirt cheap. Anyway it's only money you'll find out. I think you've only known him like six weeks. Yeah, exactly...and that is why I really want you to come. Otherwise I'm going to be stuck by the pool. On my own while he's off working. Look it...whatever it's fine all I'm saying is just... I do not know... you're going to go through all of that same pregnancy baby stuff for the next two years and... ...it's going to be harder now because you're going to have three kids and you're never going to be able to get out. You need to loosen up. What? So remind me who I was supposed to be going with? It's not like you don't know Steph... ...and this guy he's cool he's really interesting. - Super excellent. - Yeah he is. - He's different from all the others. - Does he wear a leather jacket? I don't know maybe, but I reckon you'd really like him. Come on! You're just giving up on him. I thought we were planning on getting you a bigger car. And I just lost two really good contracts. I want to go. Everyone says that everything's going to pick up. No...no...no...don't... Not tonight. You don't dare... Okay, alright, alright... Okay, what? - Okay... - Did I hear okay? - No... - Okay what? - Okay what? - We'll talk about it. - Okay what? - We'll talk about it...tomorrow! Yeah thanks for everything.

You know what? I'm going to have an even better look when we get home because it's really late now and we've got to go. Okay so... You say bye bye to Nana. Any other time Hun of course. Yeah okay thanks. - Come on beautiful. - Are you going to say bye bye to Grandma Maxie? That's the way. Sorry it was so late. - Let's go. - Bye bye sweetie. Come on darling. Let's go. Alice... I haven't heard from Steph. I haven't seen her. Um I really gotta go. Sorry I'll just give you a call tomorrow. Okay? Bye. Okay guys wait for me. Here I come. Not here. - Hey here you are. - See what did I say? Straight away please. I thought we were having ice cream? Max, settle down and eat your baked beans and then you'll get some ice cream. Stop that Max! - Shit. - Are you alright? Hey mate not yet. Not yet. Not yet. If you eat your baked beans and then I will give you the ice cream I promise. That will be a deal. I want ice cream... It's okay, here come on. I want ice cream... Seriously mate, I would really appreciate it if you didn't do that. I want ice cream... Get up come on. Come on. Alice speaking. Hello? Hello? Hello? Al? Who? I want ice cream... Alright there you go. Your wish is my command. Come on. - You alright sweetie? - Yeah Al? Alice? Is there anyway at all of tracing it? If it shows unrecognized, the number is either privately listed or originated from overseas. can you find out which country? We can only see the details like this call came from overseas. Beyond that we have no access. - Okay. - I'm sorry. Thank you. Hello. Where are you from? - From? - Yeah...from. - Australia. - Australia? - Yeah - Yeah! - Sidney. - Sidney! Yeah. I have family in Sydney. - You? - Yeah You know? Yeah...cool...cool. Yeah. He didn't say anything. Seriously Dave, I'm not going to go completely changing the routine. But Al, listen - I do have to work out of here. - You need to ring Foreign Affairs. - You can't just...you know, up and leave. Just out of the blue like that. You should have thought about that before you fucked my sister. Eh Al...Al...Al! They know already anyway. Steph...Steph called DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) before she left. ...and it doesn't change anything. I said it doesn't change any...can you hear me out. Please. Please. For two seconds. We were completely off our heads. I can't even hardly remember now... ...what actually happened... ...but I do not have feelings for her... ...or anything like that. Alright? I was a bad guy... ...and I cannot tell you how sorry I am, I really... Come on mate! Just please...can you just... It can be inclusive so we are having lunch. Susan and I - we are having lunch. Or...uh...it can be exclusive... So I can say...um...Mary and I are having lunch, but not you, Susan. We are having lunch. Any questions? Hi, you've called Alice leave me a message and I'll get back to you. Thanks. - Here you go. - Thank you. - I'm putting some plastic bag for you. - Oh cool. Pick. What are you doing? Uh I'm getting beers for tonight. - Uh huh. Cool! - You? I'm going for a swim. - Cool. - Cool. Ahh...Jiminy Cricket. Christ! Wanna come? I am not yelling at you... What happened... Jeremy turns up tomorrow. - Well I thought that's exactly what we wanted. - They could arrest him. They could arrest him for trafficking... ...and they could hang him...they could hang him Al. Come on! That's ridiculous! I don't think anybody is going to get executed... - ...for having five or six extacy tablets. - Why don't you look it up then. - You look it up. There's a computer. - What exactly is your problem with this? It was a bad idea to keep this quiet in the first place. - If he was in jail at least we'd know he was alive. - I don't think this even about him. - What? - I think it's about you... ...reacting emotionally to something that's between you and me and seriously nobody else. Oh what? ...because we should have discussed it... we should have discussed it...you run after the fucking... ...the government...about something you don't know anything about... You want me to discuss this with you? You're wondering why I wouldn't discuss this with you. - You know what Dave? You just... - Discussed with me...yes. You can say whatever you want, but... It is going to look really strange now because I've already told them one thing and you're going to go in there and you're going to say something completely different. Excuse me. Yeah listen mate, something just came up alright so... - There's nothing I can do about it. - Yeah alright. I'll be there as soon as I can. - Hello! - Hello? Al! - Ali - Goodbye. - Who was that? What was that? - What? Who was it? - Who cares? Someone... - Who were you talking to you? A student. What was he talking about that? What did he want?! I don't know Dave he's new he was just saying "hello". Wait so he was just randomly driving by... Yeah I guess. Why? What? Look... I've only got a half hour park - we should go. This is crazy and difficult. So...straight through to Annabelle. She'll sign you out. Time for you guys. Straight down the left, first door on the right. - Thanks Steph. - Thanks This is just a follow up on what Alice raised with us yesterday regarding drug use on that night. Up until now we really don't have much to go on. So... Sir. Ah. This is detective Senior Sargeant John Canane. He'll be sitting with us today. John is with the federal police. - Hi - Sure, hi. And, as you know we work together closely on all these cases. ...and the idea was it to sell the remaining tablets at the party? Probably. I don't know for sure. I didn't ask him. You know obviously that if...when you... ...it was going to turn out like this we would have said something at the time. Yeah. And you didn't meet yourself with the supplier? No I don't know who his supplier was. Not any time in that week? Well, like I say...um... I didn't ask him anything about...you know... ...because he just walked in that afternoon with a handful of pills. Excuse me. Yep. Where abouts? Alright. That is disappointing. Thanks for letting me know. Sorry! Uhh...I don't think...I mean with respect... I think it would be pretty naive to think that we were the only people at that party... - ...on ecstasy. - Of course. Look all I can think is that maybe, maybe his... ...that he saw me with Steph and he's been upset by that. Okay. - Well probably I think it's best if... - You said there was no way he could have seen you. Well you know...I don't... I don't think that he did...but...it's a possibility. Look...it was dark. Look, I can't say anything for sure but I don't think that it had anything to do with drugs. I think we go back over the night... ...try to remember any small details... ...anything you might have missed, yeah? That bearing in mind that Jeremy was almost certainly affected by drugs. - Okay. - Okay? Wow. Hey, Al. Look at these little elephants. Babe look at these. - How much would it be for that? - Babe don't worry about that. Twenty dollars? Ah! It opens. One? Let me get it. I'll get this one. I want to get it. No more. Is it you...It's you on your own, right? Listen, look it's like this. Alright? Dave, sure...and I might see that at a party or something and I like it. Alright, I like the design. I know some people up in China so I'll give them a call and I'll send them a photo or a sample... ...two weeks later I've got 400 shirts on a boat. Okay now each shirt - it costs me a dollar fifty by the time it's landed. I take them out and sell them in the shops for twenty five. So that's a fifteen hundred percent markup. Right there. In two weeks I made ten grand. - This is crazy! - Thank you! - You're very nice. - Ah koon. Ah mate, I've got this one. - No, no, no... - No seriously, I got it. Dave, it's like twelve bucks. Thank you. Look, these things. Right? They're everywhere around here. I retail probably... ...three, four thousand of them a year? Ten bucks a pop, and they cost me two. I mean that's it. People just...they want to buy it. I mean it's just simple honest business. Supply and demand. I mean anyone can do it, it's just... people don't think of it. Good for you! He is eh? Smart boy I got here. Anyway. That's very cool. Mrs. King, hi. I'm so sorry I thought you said twelve thirty. Oh it's alright. My mistake. My head's kind of all over the place. It's okay...it's okay. Jim, thanks. I'm so sorry. Oh please! Jim's been keeping you entertained I hope? - Thank you. - Please, have a seat. Thank you! You're expecting. I am. In April. A little girl. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I went past the house and collected his mail. So, it's your first baby? Uh no. Uh we have um a little four year old boy and a five year old girl. A boy and a girl. That's nice. - Mr. and Mrs. King...I ah... - Call me Helen. Helen? I just... I could make a cup of tea if you... Oh yeah that would be lovely. - Jim? - Thank you. And some fruit cake, Love. It's in the orange container. Thanks. Je dois voir le dentiste d'urgence. J'ai une dent cassee. Ah right. That's all I've ever remembered. Yeah no that's great. That's great and it's handy. It's definitely. And useful...because you know dentist. They're useful people... - Shut up! What about you? Oh God, no, no, no... You don't want to hear me. - I can barely speak English. My French is like a fucking strangled cow. - No. Where would you go? Oh I do not know. The Moon! - Be serious. - Oh I am. Actually I've got one. Mon hovercraft... ...est plein de poissons. My hovercraft is full of fish. But that's it. That's all you get the show's over, lady. Stop. Come on it's fun. It's like the ultimate fantasy. I'd stay here then. Yeah, I'm sorry I had to swing by the house. and pick up the case. I'll be over there in about fifteen. Alright take care. Oh I've got another call coming through. Cheers. Hi, you've reached Dave from Boat Works. I'm unable to take your call right now. but please leave a message. I'll get back to you. Thanks. Yeah David, John Canane from the FPA just trying again. I'm not sure if you got any of my messages. Just hoping you can give me a call as soon as you're able. My number again is 0414666131. Thank you. That's at the airport just before we left. - Thanks Jim. - Thank you. Oh your sister is very attractive. I can see why he's so taken with her. Did you see this one Jim? I'm sorry, we need to be left alone. Right now. Thanks for coming. Hey! Hey, what are you doing? What do you want?! Hi...um...I'm a friend of Jeremy's. You get to go home to your kids. and...and your wife...and your fucking life. I don't have...anything. I don't have anyone... ...that I can talk to. Everyone just acts like I don't exist. And you guys...you guys...you just treat me like I am some piece of dirt... ...you want swept under the carpet. But you know what? You were there to. You are just as responsible as I am. Listen, no one is responsible for anything for a start. He didn't see anything. How do you keep knowing that for sure? You...you... Fuck I don't... I don't know anymore. It's all that makes sense. I mean he must... He must have seen us. Nothing else makes any sense. I don't know what to do. This is driving me... ...crazy. How do you know that? How do you know for certain? Alice! If I could just give you my card. Get him to give me a call. Yeah? Yeah, sure. Sorry to bother you again. No, that's okay. Is there anything that I can do to help? Just, get him to call me. - I'd appreciate it. - Okay. Has there been any news? Nothing like that. No. I'm sorry. - Good night. - Good night. Guys! I've asked you to please wash your hands and get ready for dinner. Guys! Now! Do it now! And I want all of that stuff put back in my room where you found it. Now! Please go! I'm sure you've got more really important places to be right now but I actually needed that chicken twenty minutes ago so if you don't mind I could do with some help here. Max! Give that to me. I told you to put everything back in my room. Go! Go! Go now! I'm really sorry. Something really weird happened to me. Al? Did they go down okay? Is that the chicken? Al, I want us to talk about... I do not know... Well I been thinking about that we could move out of this place. Somewhere bigger. Before the baby comes. Well I've been thinking about it for a while actually. You know I think it would be better now rather than...you know... ...when you got your hands full with the baby and everything. Alice. Because Alice, if the guy comes around to our house... - ...I'm thinking he gave your a card... - So call the number. I will. He must of said something. I'm really sorry. No it's fine. I've just been... I'm really sorry. This is so silly of me. Hi, you've called Jeremy King of Knight Market Imports. I am overseas until the nineteenth, but if you leave a message... MISSING PERSONS.

I don't understand what I've done wrong. She...she turns up, right? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to go fucking hide in a bar or something? I don't know... ...but it seems like you've always got someone else to blame. Listen, she is also happens to be family. - Yeah! - Right and she does...she needs somebody. She's family. Yeah, exactly. I don't know what this is about. This is about the fact that you are keeping things from me. - I don't know who you are anymore. - What things? - I don't know what to believe! - Alice, what things? Fuck I don't know. I don't give a... Alright, you are aware of what you're doing with that? Aren't you? Fuck. Alice, listen. I'm not... ...having an affair with your sister.

I was completely freaking out and I couldn't even drive my car.... ...and I couldn't even move. What am I meant to make of that? A panic attack that you have never had. A fucking panic attack in your whole life. Alright now, you've fucking made your point with that. Or is that something maybe I should be asking the federal police about? Jesus fucking Christ. You know I'm really okay with having this conversation with you when you have fucking settled down. But right now with this you realise you're probably killing our child. I need you to get out of here. I need you to get out of here. Alright? - Alice? - Just get out of here! - Stop it! - Mom! Oh hey cheeky. I'm going to go out for a little while, okay? I don't want you to go out. It's gonna be alright. I'll go and see if she's in her room. - Hi - Hi Did you want to come inside? - I keep trying to call you... - I need you... ...to stop contacting Dave. I need you to leave us both alone. Okay? Okay. Okay. Is that why you came here? Just don't fucking do it! Steph. Okay? Just don't do it. We've got kids. I can't fucking leave him. Alright? I can't fucking to anything. It's just...I don't...I shouldn't have to deal with you being there all the time. Do you understand?! Are you drunk? I need you to respect my situation. What about my situation? Al? Have you ever thought about what I might be going through in all this? Al? Alice? Thank you. Hey hello, sir. You look for the bar? No man. I'm good. Whiskey, yes? Whiskey? Cigarette? - Yeah, cigarette? - No I got one man, I'm good. Hey, hey marijuana? You know... How far along are you? How far along are you? 28 weeks... - Yeah. - Cool. Do you want her? You like? That's good. Huh? Girl? It's nice girl. It's a real very cheap. No man. No. I just...I...you know I come here, I just want to have a drink. You know just a drink. You know what?
