He liked talking to the mummies. He'd make the dead reveal the secrets of the living. -He'd talk to the mummies? -Of course. You're from Rome. There are some things you can't understand. Open it. See him? Bernardo da Corleone a great 17th century lawyer. In those days the dead person's family would come and tell the deceased their secrets. And our Don Bernardo, who at the time was still alive, would come down to the crypt at night and get the corpses to tell him everything. So he knew everthing about everybody. Everything about everybody. "Let me talk about little white jasmines..." This fatal,just-picked blossom symbolises the purity of his existence. And its scent evokes the goodness he brought to the courts and to his family. It was this Spring blossom which caught the last breath of Judge Varga, who will now appear before the ultimate Judge and be admitted to His Kingdom. For thirty years he fought against crime and the Mafia, and the Mafia has killed him. He was the Mafia! He was the Mafia! Organised crime has never been so daring before. It's the first time a judge has been murdered. Mafia! You're the Mafia! You're the Mafia! It's an appalling crime aimed against the whole judiciary... and it's a challenge to the State's authority! Why is your name linked to the dead judge and garbage? They attack me because I was his best friend. What about the garbage? Come and have a look. Hear that? They're not striking for more pay. They even have cars to come to work. They're starting a cholera epidemic just to screw me. Where does Judge Varga come into it? Varga was murdered because he was about to arrest them. Not these wretches, but their puppeteers. Give me a hand. This guy's dead. He has no pulse. Judge Varga knew every secret behind every door. He had drawers full of court files. He acted on some, but ignored the others. You were his friend. You admired him, didn't you? I liked the man. He wasn't in it for money. He thrived on power. Inspector. A phone call from Rome. Sorry. I need your authorisation to move elsewhere right away. Where? They killed another judge some 100km from here The two crimes may be linked. Go, but keep me informed. The Minister is concerned. Shall we arrest him? Why? As usual, they won't talk. This guy heard nothing, saw nothing, knows nothing. Do you get many lemons? Alot. They want to cut it down to build houses Tell me something ... Did you know the judge? Of course. He issued the orders to resume the farms. What was he like? Like this town... Just what they wanted. Sargeant. Captain. Is this you? It might be. Did you bring us all this way just to identify a photo? Why were you at Judge Varga's funeral? Were you a friend too? We had ceased to be on friendly terms. But when he was a junior judge... When you killed that unionist... Everyone was acquitted. Sure. But this time you've gone too far. You shouln't mess with judges. Inspector, you're wasting your time with us. And you know it. If it's payback as you call it, that's between the judges. Brave Chief Judge Calamo is dead. He's the third judge to be killed. The police do nothing to stop this mad slaughter. And their inertia gives rise to all sorts of speculation. We're being killed off and our reputations are tarnished. The judiciary is sound but parliament is ineffective. The government is weak. They're the reason the country is plunging into chaos. Find me that raving maniac. Only a maniac would go around killing judges. Get this into your heads. As chief of police, your head will be the first to roll. You're our best man , but yours will be the first head to roll. Stop the damaging stories about the murdered judges. What's this? The late Chief Judge Calamo had them in a drawer. He had several million in the bank. What on earth are you doing? Piecing together three lives. Don't waste time with the dead. We need somone who's alive and guilty. Stop looking for rationality. We're dealing with a paranoid. If he's paranoid, it's with good reason. What did you mean by "paranoid with good reason"? Three judges have been killed in twenty days, in three towns quite near each other. All killed the same way, by bullets from the same gun,. which must be a rifle and silencer. Enough evidence to suggest a vendetta. A vendetta? By whom? A victim of a judicial error. Do you know whether the three judges were ever on the same case? Yes.They worked together for eight years Doctor. The plane is ready to take off. Let me say one more thing. Actually I knew there'd be another killing in this town. I have'nt made a mistake. I was here when they shot Calamo. Then the papers are right You're a jinx. Anyway, I've come up with some facts. Three people from this area were unjustly sent to jail for several years. A chemist whose wife tricked the judges, a mechanic rumoured to be gay, and a trucker who's now a hobo. So, what's your next step? One of the trio is the killer. - How are things? - Bad. - What's bad? - Everything. - And before? - Before what ? Were things better before? - No. - So ? So... Here we are. What do you think about these judges being killed? Were you sentenced by Varga? He was the prosecuting judge in that trial. He asked for 30 years. He said he regretted there was no death penalty. Did Judge Sanza deliver the sentence? Judge Sanza gave me a discount... 27 years. But he wasn't alone. I know. Judge Rasto was there too. And Rasto is still alive. What do you want from me? Later they proved I was innocent. True. You were innocent and spent four years in jail. I've served 52 years unjustly. Spending four in jail was no big deal. Jail is a safe place. - Who's there? What do you want? - Police. Leave me alone. You've made my life miserable. Enough. Get out of here! Come here. Do you remember Judge Varga? Chief Judge Sanza and the other one Calamo ? Bastards... They were all bastards. And so you killed them. - I wish I did. Do you live here? Have you a gun? Go and get it. You get it. Clear off! You don't answer me like that. Understand? What shall we do? No one's seen him. He might be sleeping. Stay here and keep an eye out for him. Yes, doctor. Is Dr Maxia here. That's me. Can I help you? I'm inspector Rogas. I'd like a word with you. At your service. I'll be back shortly. Please sit down. Thanks. This is what I want to know. I'm told you're the only friend of the chemist, Cres. Friend! It's hard to use the term in Cres' case. Let's say a frequent caller. - So you see him often?. - Yes, yes. Actually, I'm the one who keeps an eye on him. I try to get him to mix. with other people. Seen him today? - No. I don't think Cres went out at all today. I knocked on his door but no one answered. He ofter pretends he's not at home. You mean it's happened to you too? Yes, often. Cres is always in the house? Are you sure he couldn't have gone somewhere else. As far as I know the only trips Cres takes are inside the walls of his own house. - See? He's not here. - So he does go out? Then, it's not true that he's not always here? Strange. Maybe he's left. I'll go see if he switched the meter off. What's all this music? Cres is crazy about tangos. He collected thousands of them, inspector. Tangos of all kinds, from lots of places He's put speakers all over the house. This is the wife of Cres. She used animal welfare to frame him. Do you think Cres was innocent too? He prepared the chocolate rice. He cooked it quite ofter. Yes, my husband ! Well then do any doubts still linger? No. Not unless we think this poor woman designed a diabolical scheme to incriminate her husband. Even to the extent of sacrificing a life, of a poor innocent cat. For years the only companion in her lonely existence. That would be absurd! He wanted to murder his wife. He set up a fake suicide. You must find him guilty. The woman, where is she now ? Your guess is as good as mine. She took off while he was still in jail. She stripped half the house, and left him with her portrait. And he's placed it in front of his bed. Doctor! Is the headless figure Cres? I think so. Maybe his wife did it out of spite. Who was next to you here? Probably Cres. Probably? Don't you have any photographs of Cres? I did have a few, but he took them all back. Who is it? I'm inspector Rogas. Come in. The judge is is waiting for you. Come in. The police inspector is here. Your honour. Good evening. Inspector Rogas. Please sit down. Thank you. Will you excuse me a moment? Certainly Well? Forgive me for calling on you at this hour. But I've been trying in vain to see Mr Cres, the chemist. But his house is locked. And no one is answering. What do you want with the chemist? Nothing in particular. I looked up his file..... a strange case indeed. I need to put a face to it. I want to meet the man. But the Cres trial has no link with anything nowadays. It was much talked about. And the sentence was very controversial. Weren't you one of the judges? I was only the recorder. The decision was made by Judge Varga and Chief Judge Sanza . And they've both been killed. Forty metres. They fired from over there. Who lives there? It's a condemned building A fire was lit in one of the rooms. The killer must have spent the night there. He must have known the judges' habit pretty well. Aren't they removing the corpse? Doctor, there's an ambulance strike. We can't find a vehicle. Use one of our cars. Do you need the union's approval? Were you really here when he was shot? Not exactly. I saw the judge last night... but I didn't kill him. Why did you visit the judge? Nothing important, Just routine . Surely you must have some clues... It's the fourth since you began investigating. Gentlemen, talk to the local police. Inspector, our readers want to know... Hey! Ah. Look who's here! One judge is a police matter, but kill four, it's political. So you'll give me a political interpretation. Don't you read the papers? No, especially yours. Good! Let's get away from here. Your colleagues won't give me peace ! Come on. Get into my car! Too bad you don't read our paper, it's the only one defending you. Defending me. How ? We're not into witch hunts. We are not about raising tension in the community. We want to do out jobs. Without any interference from above. So that's what you write! Well done. At times the police even suit the Communist Party! If they all did their job like you do. But I do it for you. We were school mates and we went fishing together. But trust your friends. It's all politics. It's your government cronies who play dirty politics. Listen... You can be frank with me - What's behind all this? - None of what you might think. Nor of what my government gronies think. I'll tell you a story, off the record. A nice story. It's about a man, his wife and a cat This one? No. This one? No, I'm afraid not. This one? I believe this one resembles him a little. But it's only a drawing not a photograph! Enough time's spent on this, we have to finish! You! Give me your description again. Wanted. A man, 175 cm tall, stocky with greying brown hair. perfect teeth, slightly aquiline nose. ... JUDGE ASSINATED ... ... JUDGE PERRO SHOT DEAD AT 6.30PM IN ROME ... These brutal and appalling crimes are an attack on law and order. MESSAGE FROM THE HEAD OF STATE They are the diabolical fruit of the actions... of groups of young agitators who preach violence as a means to an end, and sow seeds of delirium in weaker minds. It is time to say 'Enough, we will be strong!' You saw the assassin? I heard a shot and saw two youths run away. That's all. You were just passing by at that moment? Yes but I heard nothing, though. I was on my bicyle when two youths knocked me over. Why were you at the scene of the crime ? I was in the basement, I'm a printer. I went upstairs to get a little fresh air. I heard a woman shout and saw him on a bicycle. At last! While you waste your time on your little toy. chasing your phantom lunatic, the true killer is exterminating judges, leaving the country in a state of panic. Actually, it was you who mentioned lunatics. You came here to tell me. But you were there and had to see what wasn't there. Meaning? Pleas sit down. I was saying they were everywhere. At Varga's funeral, where Sanza was killed... They even set up camp. A demonstation and a camp site don't prove murder. What about the eyewitnesses? There were eyewitnesses to Judge Perro's murder? Nobody seen him shot, they saw someone run away. Enough talk. You're an excellent detective. The best criminal investigator we've got. But this now is a political affair. We have already made too many mistakes. It is imperative firstly to restore the good name of the police. You will work with the political squad.. and collaborate with Inspector Bloma. This way. Get this to the Minister quickly Yes Sir. The telephone calls are continuously recorded? But where're all the tapes stored? Don't you worry! After they're of value to the Justice Ministry they destroy them. Rogas, come here a minute! Isn't that your friend there? The communist journalist? - Is he being watched too? - No, only his leader... Amar. "Times are difficult." "This meeting must end with a clear decision." "A party like ours can't be surprised... and influenced by the actions of the government." Let's see what are they sending us now. Ah the Justice builings. "Then, the chancillor, wrote: The demand, response:" "I have been coming to the capital all these months..." "I brought cheques from the petroleum companies... to the secretariate of the Christian Democratic Party" "who then distributes them according to the quota.. to all the other parties, except the Communist party" "Nothing to the Communists ? "To the Communists, no." "To some affilliates of theirs but not much" Senta! Put in the tape of the shooting of the Z Group. Si, doctor. We are monitoring this group's publications, in the last 6 months. And we focus on articles.. that attack Magistrates and Judges. Can I have the article from Permanent Revolution? Thanks. It's the newspaper of the Group Z. This is Galano, head of Group Z. The most fanatical. Listen what he has writen about judges! The article is tittled "The Monsters" "Bony and withered, often obese and flaccid... "their faces marked by infamy of their office, every year dressed like clowns as bishops don't dare. They're the high magistrates who inaugurate the judicial year telling us to lock more people up." - Stand up! - Me? Yes you, stand up. - Start walking. - Where? Walk up and down until we tell you to stop. Turn round Start walking Start walking Do you recognise him? Is it him? Derecho ! Turn round Start Walking Adelante ! Muevete ! Do you recognise him? Is it him? Back to square one. The two youths bumped into you and you fell off your bicycle. I didn't say I fell. I was knocked over. Same thing. You saw them run away. The darker guy was limping. I didn't see any dark guy. It does'nt matter. But he did have a limp. Maybe. It was so quick. One moment. How quick? As a flash. Then they got into the car. A car? You never mentioned a car. You never gave me a chance. You kept asking about those youths. Bring the girl here. Sit here. - You saw the car, didn't you ? - What car? The car in the street when Judge Perro was shot. Ah yes, the big foreign car. How do you mean foreign? Why didn't you tell us about the car? So what if there was a car? I see so many cars in a day. They're part of my job. - Was the car parked? - Yes. It was. I went up to it to see if I could do some business... That's why I noticed it was big, nice and foreign. - Switzerland - Then? Nothing. They started the engine and took off. - With the youths? - What youths? Those hippies. They suddenly started running. I saw them get into the car. What is he talking about ? When the car took off, the hippies ran away on foot. Okay, let's start from scratch. This is your statement. I'll read it to you. '' At 6pm on the 25th, in front of the Justice Building. I was about to cross the street,... when I noticed my shoe strap was undone. I bent down to do it up and heard a shot." - Then? - I turned around. - What did you see? - Two youths ran into this guy. - And then? - They ran off up the street - And the car? - Went in the opposite direction Ha! He couldn't have seen anything... because he was leaning over the dead man. I insist. They got into the car. You were shit scared. You didn't see anything. Listen Bloma, I have thought it over carefully I won't work with someone else. Even the chief thought I wasn't right for this. Maybe you have a point. A break will do you good. Yes but first I have to ease my conscience. I have to tell a guy he's about to die. Good morning,inspector. May I speak to Chief Judge Riches? Who are you? I am inspector Rogas. Wait here. Inspector. Come back tomorrow. He can't see you now. Okay. That car it's the Police Commissioner's? - Is he with the judge ? - And why are you asking? It's not for me. But at least get in touch with the boy. By the way the school fees are due. Don't worry. You know I've been away. I'll do it tomorrow. Marco says he never sees you. - When did you see him? - Last Sunday. - Was he all right? - Yes, he was fine. Don't forget the college fees. Yes yes, bye. And now a news update General De Sarmiento was today appointed Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces He was sworn in before the joint chiefs of the air force, the army and the navy. The ceremony was followed by a military parade which included a special police unit. Various diplomats were in attendance... General de Sarmiento was today appointed Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. He was sworn in before the joint chiefs of the air force, the army and the navy. - Is that Rogas? - Yes. Good evening doctor. Why did you visit Riches? To warn him he's in danger. So you're still insisting in chasing your lunatic. The judge will be killed in any case. The chief judge is well protected. I know. Today I saw all the security forces at Riches'. I even spotted your car. We were'nt with Riches. We had a function next door at the Portuguse Embassy. Okay, go and see Riches,.. but don't alarm him. - Hello - Hello. The Portuguese Embassy? - Yes, who's speaking? - I'm the police commissioner's chauffeur. My boss forgot his briefcase at today's function. What function was that ? The ambassador is away in Lisbon. Sorry. It must be a mistake. Thanks. - Yes? - It's Rogas. - Hi. - I need a favour. Find the owner of a white mercedes with Swiss plates. Any other details? First two numbers are 9 and 7. You find out the others. Sit down. So. You think I'll be killed. Yes. I believe they'll try. The subversives or that other guy? The other guy... Cres. Ah, That's right.... The chemist. He tried to kill his wife, His plan was too naive. What did he get? on appeal. Not by me. I meant by the court over which you presided. So! - He was innocent. - Really? I think he was. Was he innocent,.. or do you just think he was? I do think he was innocent, but I can't be sure. I see... You can't be sure about it. Yes, I have a doubt. I think it was an error, a judicial error. Judicial errors don't exist. - You're a practising Catholic? - Pracising, no. A Catholic nevertheless. Sure, like everyone else. I presume you go to mass from time to time. Ever considered the issue of bread and wine,.. turning into the body and blood of Christ? Each time... Each time the priest eats that bread,.. and drinks that wine, the mystery is fulfilled That must always happen. It can never be otherwise. The priest may be unworthy in thought or deed, but simply due to the status he holds,.. each time the mass is celebrated the mystery is fulfilled. When a judge delivers the law,.. he is exactly like a priest officiating at mass. A judge may have doubts he may question himself, even torment himself,. but at the very moment he delivers judgement,.. he can't harbour doubts. At that moment justice is done. Always? One priest celebrating mass had blood on his hands. Because he had doubts. That has never happened to me. No judgement has ever left blood on my hands. No conviction has ever left blood on my gown. It's obviously a question of faith. I don't think you've quite understood. I'm not a Catholic. Nor am I a Christian. However, I've never had any of these weaknesses. I've never believed in Voltaire's "Tratado sobre la tolerancia" on tolerance and judicial error. Virtue, pity, innocent victims of judicial errors.... What errors? A judge who can freely kill with his sentences...Ba! Voltaire was the first to sow doubt about the judicial system. When a religion allows for people's doubt,.. that religion is dead. That's why we had Sartre, Bertrand Russell, Marcuse... and the delirium of today's youth. You mean Voltaire is to blame? Yes. But Voltaire had an excuse. In his day they didn't realise the danger of those ideas... but today's mass culture has made that danger mortal. If things go on like this, the only viable form of justice will be a form of punishment known in war as decimation. The way I punish is to kill one soldier in ten. Today there are no more individuals! Today, there is no more individual responsibility! Your job, my dear friend has become ridiculous. It was fine in peace time, but now we're at war. Robberies, kidnappings, sabotage... This is war! And as in war the answer is decimation. One, two, three, four, five... Out! One, two, three, four, five... Cres, convicted! Cres has a .22 calibre rifle,.. and it is loaded with a bullet for you. Keep going. Back all the way. Park down there. Go on! Go on! Stop! Who lives below Judge Riches? - Mr Pattos.. - The shipping tycoon? Yes. Inspector. Mr Pattos. What are you doing here? - Sorry, I didn't think... - What did you not think? That you'd meet me in my friend Pattos' place? I didn't think I'd be intruding in a reunion of frieds. Too late now. So? - I was looking for someone. - Looking for me? No, someone who just come in. One of my guests? Please come in. Come with me. The inspector was surely looking for me. Are you here to arrest me? My dear Evaristo, you are a big liar.. You always denied the police tapped our phones. The inspector's presence here proves my case. - Is this right? - Not that I know of. How amazing! Did he expect to get any other answer? I know nothing about phone tapping. It is done sometimes,.. but always with prior judicial approval,.. and only criminal suspects are tapped. It is never done for political reasons. Never.. That means I'm a criminal suspect,.. because my phone is definately tapped. In fact, it's not even my phone. The phone belongs to my host, Norcio, There,here's the great progressive writer. No, No. You're not my guest you're the guest of my wife. I'd never take an arsehole like you into my house... a provincial intellectual like you! They brag on about permanent revolution... You wish the inspector had come here to arrest you. Then you'd be a hero. - Wilfredo, Don't be ridiculous! - Shut your mouth! What a reactionary remark 'Shut your mouth'. Just because I'm your wife, because you're my husband! No. Because you're a parrot, not a woman! There's nothing can be done. You're a typical communist, catholic, bourgeois. Yes, for a long time, not to keep up with the latest fashion! Now that we are winning, communists, catholics, the bourgeoisie,.. you're all queueing up to jump on the bandwagon! No my dear, I don't like it! Including you and that arsehole who wanted revolution! Hello,hello, ladies and gentlemen. Mo more of these family quarrels. We're here to enjoy ourselves.. to eat. Champagne? - a whisky ? - No, thanks. Have a drink, Rogas. You're not on duty. Your assignment here is over. Come with me.. To them it's a game. - A game? I wouldn't say so.. - Yes, yes a game. Including me, I'm playing the game too.. I'm like a umpire... delivering both protection and threats.. Don't let appearances fool you, Rogas. Despite the confidence, they're still scared. More scared than they've ever been. When the party's over they'll flee in all directions. No one will sleep in their beds tonight. Who do they fear? They think you coming here was part of a plot... and your sudden appearance was planned. My dear Rogas, subversive groups like Calano's are useful to us. And to our Communist Party friends. Friends? Your know what the situation is like. My party, which has run the country for 30 years,.. will be forced to rule with the Communists. Your own job would be easier, Rogas if Mr Amar, that party's leader, was in my chair. This ministry would work. It'd be fun to see Mr Amar and his party grappling with these groups. Yes, well. And what should we do? Continue harassing these groups as much as you can. Arests, controls, searches... but always with the approval of the judges. Before they're all killed! If you're here to arrest Galano? At least give us back our minister! Hang around, Rogas. We will continue our conversation. Hot coffee and cold milk. Waiter, a whisky. Find out who they are and what they want from me. How can I? We're always being watched. If they find out, I'm finished. I didn't tell you to do it inside. Why not use your own lab? You did it with the oil bosses. Give me a cigarette. Come on, give me one. Thanks. Placing a bug under the commissioner's arse. I'm fucked! And now, Minister, allow me to address a burning issue. Ever since I left the house of the president of the Supreme Court,.. I have the feeling that I'm being followed by professionals. By people specifically suited to that task. As if trained in a state or private police corps. If people in high places, deem it necessary,.. to give me protection,... I can only be grateful, ... but I should point out that such surveillance,... which is very expensive with so many officers involved,... would be better directed at protecting the judges. You'll never get out of here unless you confess first! And that goes for everbody! To the Security Minister It's the tanks. Their motors run all night. The meeting's at the armoured division barracks. Listen, this is him. Take it easier with those judges... Rewind, Rewind. Play it again. Those judges.. Take it easier with those judges... Rogas is on our back. He's smelt a rat. Come on, once more. Those judges Take it easier, with those judges. Rogas is on our back. He's smelt a rat. - Is that it? - Isn't that enough? - Is that you, Rogas? - Yes, good evening, doctor. Why did you visit Riches? To warn him he's in danger. So you're still insisting in chasing your lunatic. The judge will be killed whether it's by my lunatic or your group. The judge is well protected. I know. Today I saw all the security forces at Riches'. I even spotted your car. It's a plot. The chemist Cres killed his judges, and now they keep killing the others. We come across so many plots, they prepare one a day. We've managed to keep them in check so far. But this time you've got to do something fast. We must wait,.. We can't risk everything by behaving rashly.. You don't understand. I'm not saying you pre-empt their counter-revolution,.. but just inform parliament or the press. We can't alarm everyone.. because you have certain impressions. What impressions? I have proof. They're all implicated. If that's the case, it's no use discussing it any further. You must see Amar. Only the party secretary can decide. Amar is like all the others. In a room of the National Gallery... a groupe of visitors discovered two bodies. The police have now identified the victims... Mr Amar, the secretary of the Communist Party, and police inspector Amerigo Rogas. Both victims were probably shot with the same weapon, a gun which Inspector Rogas was still holding in his hand. Here's the chief of police's interpretation Inspector Rogas had just return from a very stressful mission... to find the judges killer, When he returned to the capital he showed signs of mental imbalance. As a result he was placed on leave. He was seeing plots everywhere. and started looking for non-existent evidence. Perhaps he thought even the secretary of the Communist Party... was part of some imaginary plot. He killed him and then turned the gun on himself. So it seems we've accepted their version. Everything points to him being the killer. I don't believe it, I knew Rogas well. He was no lunatic. There was a plot. They felt so confident, they went all the way. And now they have invented the ultimate provocation. A police inspector kills the party secretary. Even if that's so, what do you want? A civil war? A confrontation? No. But we won't be accomplices. Incite the people in the square? This is wh1at they want? So people will never know the truth. Truth is not always revolutionary.
