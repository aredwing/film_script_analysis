You know, we need the money and your drug habit ain't so cheap. Dude, I thought you said he never turns on the alarm. Ashley! Ashley! Out right now! Dude! Ash! Get in the car! Travis? Travis! Stop, this is the police. Drop what you got in your hands! In the healing process, you will find that there can be many triggers in your path, keeping you from a full recovery of the disease of drug dependence. Making drug independence, a journey that always seems out of reach or an unattainable goal. So, how do we make the unattainable attainable? Or in other words, maximize the highest rate of success? Any ideas? As, you know, Ashley has successfully completed our inpatient drug rehabilitation program. We also take measures to insure the continued success of the patient in their outpatient program. In our recent discussions, Lisa, you- given your current situation- What current situation? Ashley. I Did what you wanted and even now you don't want me. Look, you're on probation and I'm done making sure that you stay out of trouble. So where does that leave me? I've talked to your aunt, about you staying with her for a while. You could ride horses with her like you used to. Travis, what are you doing here? I came to get you. Are you crazy? After what you did to me. I took the fall for you. Just get out of here before my aunt shows up. I'm sorry, okay? I didn't know what to do. I saw the cops and tried to warn you, I swear. The reason I was in this place is because of you. The whole thing was your idea. I'm the one who had to spend 6 months in here, and on top of that, I still have another Just stay away from me! Let me show you to your room. Wanna help? No, I don't know how to cook or anything. Come on, I got most of it done already. You can mix the salad. Come on. Fine. But I'm just doing the salad. Okay. Mind if I say grace? Lord, we thank you for this meal that is before us, and I thank you for this time with Ashley. Amen. Hey, not so much! So I guess you think I turned out to be a real screw up, huh? I didn't realize you were done yet. A few short years ago, you wouldn't have given up so easily. Hi. How are you? Come on in. You guys take a seat. Thank you. And I'll be right back. I totally forgot I had this Bible study group coming over tonight. Take your time, I just need to get ready, and you're more than welcome to join us if you want. Well, maybe some other time. So, how's it going with your niece? At this point, I'm trying to meet her where she is. I'm trying to follow Christ's example. I just wanted to let you know, I'm here and things are okay. She can't talk right now. Your sister has a Bible group over or something. You know how she is. I'll call you later, okay? I'm tired. Bye. Hey, Ash, I'm heading out. I have riding lessons over at the stable this morning. Well, if you want to come by later, I'm right down the street. You remember where it is? I remember. Well, help yourself to anything in the kitchen. I just stocked up on fresh fruit and stuff. I'll see you later, okay? Bye. Hey, Chip. Remember me? So how many horses do you have out here? Ten or so. Most of them are border-owned horses. I have the same clients as when you used to come out a few years ago, before you guys moved. Before things went downhill. I wish we never left. Or at least when we lived out here, the barn was an escape. Do you feel like you're able to talk about things, rehab? I guess. Yeah. How did you and mom turn out so different? Your mom and I just took different paths. Hi, guys. Hi, oh, hi, Ashley. I barely recognized you. Hi. It's really good to see you out here again. Yeah, it's been a while. Ever since Diane said that you'd be staying with her, Emily's been hoping that we'd run into you. You know when you won at the world show, it really inspired Emily to follow the same goal. Oh, yeah, Emily's your biggest fan. Okay, Emily, you ready to ride? Yeah. So you want to go see my new horse? Sure, I guess. I have to go pick up Jason from baseball practice. That's fine. I'll be back in a bit. Okay. You think I could use this? Sure, I guess. This thing's been sitting around here forever. I think I've got an old bicycle pump around here somewhere. Isn't that the one we used to ride around the horse shows? Yeah. There it is. Thanks. I gotta go into town. Will you be okay out here? Yeah. How did you find me out here? I have my ways. This isn't funny. I'm not even supposed to be around you. You know, I can't stay away from you. You're my girl. I'm not that girl anymore, nor do I want to be. I miss you, Ash. You gotta go. I love you. Then why are you trying to jeopardize everything? You're right, you're right. I didn't think of it that way. Where were you? Out. And while you were, I was worrying. Well, don't. Look I- I was planning to be back before you, but I found this horse, okay? He's starving. I think we need to call someone about it, the horse rescue or something. Maybe we should take some food to him tonight. Where is he? Haden Street. That's miles from here. Ash. It's a good thing I found him. We need to help him somehow. At this point, I'm concerned with the issue at hand. You should have left me a note, Ash, or called. Mom took my cell phone, or did you forget that? I didn't know. I don't want you to feel trapped here, but for obvious reasons, I just need to know where you are, okay? Fine. Yeah? This isn't how I wanted to start out. Well, me neither. I'm heading back down to the stable, but I'll call about the horse and see if there's anything we can do. Okay? Okay. So, are we good? Yeah. Hey Travis, it's me. Is that the horse? What's his name? I don't know. You look really great. So we back together? Maybe. I've gotta get back before my aunt finds out I'm gone. Can I put my bike in your trunk? No problem. Thanks again for helping us pick him up. I'm a bit shorthanded on people who can haul for me this week. Sure, no problem. You know, it's ironic you called on this horse. The family just signed him over yesterday wanting us to place him. Come on, Winston. That's his name? According to his paperwork. Well, why couldn't they keep him? 'Cause the elderly owner was recently put into a nursing home, and the family can't afford to keep him any longer. You can just follow me to the rescue stable. Okay. Wait, what? I thought we were taking him. No, he's going to the rescue center where they'll adopt him out. Well, why can't we keep him? I can't take on anymore horses right now at the stable. Well, well, can't we put him with Chip? I'll take care of him. Well, we are running low on stall space at our facility. Diane, you're on the committee for the horse rescue program. If you're okay with it, I can release him to you for now. Well, I guess he's staying with us for a while. You still go to that church? Yeah. So what's the plan? First we'll get the vet to come check him out, and we'll need to control his feeding so his body can adjust. Then you two can get comfortable with each other and we'll take him over to the other stable. You're gonna help me, right? When you need me to. Right now, he just needs basic handling. Hey. In a while I have a hair appointment and she can fit you in also if you want. So what are you trying to say? Have you looked in the mirror lately? It's my treat. It's that bad? So, we'll leave in an hour? Okay. You like it? Yeah. She did a good job. You ready for lunch? Sure. Well, I'll stop and get us some sandwiches to go. Are you that hungry? Here you go. And I'll be right back. So your goal is to get him to walk when you walk and stop when you stop, without pulling on him to get the result. When you get that, you know he's tuned into you. That's the foundation we're going for. We need that before we can go on to other things. You off to church? You know, you're always invited. I know. Well, I'll be back in a couple of hours. Okay. You look hot. What, this old thing? I kind of like this sneaking around. Diane. Oh, hi. I've been keeping you and Ashley in my prayers. How is she doing? I really need you to continue to pray. Right now, she's trying to face her struggle, without God. Please watch over us as we go out into the world this week and encourage us to share Christ's love. In Jesus' name, amen. So how are things going with your aunt? Pretty good, I guess. I mean, it's better than being at home with my mom right now. Are you back to riding again? Not yet, but I will soon. I kind of even have my own horse right now, for a while anyway. What do you mean? Well, we rescued him from some old run-down place. What happened? The family just left him. They couldn't afford him, or didn't care. That's too bad. Yeah. So have there been any stressful situations we should talk about? It's been okay. Okay? Have you had any contact with anyone from your past, any type of contact? No. No one. This one in that hand, this one in the other and hold the reins strong. This one towards the center. Good job, Ash. I don't know. We were all over the place. You'll get it. It's something you haven't done before. You can't expect to just know it. You're learning. Steering seems pretty basic. Is this your horse? Well, for a while, I guess. Can I pet him? Sure. What's his name? Winston. Hey, Ash. I have a chiropractor appointment later. Can you feed the horses for me tonight? Yeah, sure. Great, thanks. Can you untie him and put his blanket on him when he's dry? Yeah, okay. It's not too bad, I just don't want him eating until he's completely cooled down. Got it. And your mom should be here soon. Can I help Ashley feed the horses? Sure, as long as you're ready to go when she gets here. Okay. Who are you talking to? Oh, no one. What are you doing? Nothing. You're supposed to be watchin' my back. Let's go. Texting Ashley? Yeah. How it's going? Don't worry. I'm wearing her down. She'll be back with us in no time. Do you like being here? I guess. You look so sad. I just have a lot on my mind. When I'm sad, I usually talk to God. That always makes me feel better. Where's Diane? She had a doctor's appointment. Oh, she didn't tell me. I could have come sooner if I would have known. We were doing fine. It was fun to help. Yeah, well, we better get going. Bye. You have any money? No. Why? We need something with more kick. No, thanks. Hey, what's wrong? I thought we were having a good time. We are. Then why are you trying to ruin it? Ruin it? I'm trying to make it better. You're so selfish. I'm selfish? You love a horse more than you love me. Your aunt just keeps you on such a short rope. No, no we have to go. What? I left a horse tied up. It must be starving. All right. Just stop the car here. Come on, quick. Give me some gum or something. I'm in so much trouble right now. There you are. Sorry. You left Emily's horse with no way to get food or water for hours. I said I'm sorry. Can you even walk a straight line right now? I should have known better. Here I am thinking I'm helping and that you want help and this is what I get? You know what? You're right. You should have known better than to help someone like me. This is about you and your actions and no one else. Where were you this time? Fine. You want to know where I was? I was with my boyfriend, okay? I had a little fun. Big deal. You just got out of rehab. You're not supposed to be- I can handle it. Clearly, you can't. You're left unsupervised for a couple of hours and this is what happened. You can't handle it, not yet. Please, don't undo all that you've accomplished, Ashley. Try living my life. Oh, I forgot, you're perfect. You know, keep the stupid horse. I don't want to work with him anymore. Where to? I don't want to talk. Just drive. You've been good for her, you know? You're a good mentor. I just hope I haven't messed it up. Why are we here? Travis, stop. What are you doing? I need some money. Don't do this, this is a church. Full of cash and sound equipment. This is my aunt's church. That's all the better now, ain't it? Stop, stop, I'm not gonna help you do this. What, you got a conscience now? Don't you ever get tired of this life, tired of living like this? Don't you ever want to be more than just a drug addict and thief? I thought you changed. If you don't want to help me out, go back to the car and wait 'til I'm done. Broken. Where do you turn when you've been broken? How do you go on? Broken. What do you do with shattered shards of plane? Oh, how do you find your way through the ruins of your life? How do you survive? Broken. Broken. Who will understand when you've been broken? How can you explain it, broken? Why do you feel pain. When your heart is turned to stone? Oh, how do you walk alone. Through the ruins of your life? How do you survive? Oh, Lord, I'm falling at your feet I see you broken dying for me. Oh, my redeemer how you suffered. Broken I could never understand how your heart was broken. When the Father turned away. Broken I could never understand the pain. Of hanging on a cross so, Lamb of God. You sacrificed. Your whole life Ashley. What time is it? It's morning. What are you doing out here? I was reading about God in your Bible. Which part? About the things Jesus said, then about him dying for our sins and stuff. As I was reading, I started crying, 'cause I had felt something. When it says he died for all our sins, it means me too, right? It means you too. But I really messed up. We all have, Ash. We all have the same capacity to sin. Nobody's exempt from it. But I know what Jesus did on the cross was out of his perfect and unconditional love for me and because of that, I try to abide by God's Word, not because I feel like I have all these rules to follow, but because I love him back. So what do I do now? Jesus, I believe that you are the Son of God. I believe that you died for my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me for my sins. I take you now as my Savior. I give you my life. Thank you for saving me. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. What's that? I'm supposed to be keeping a journal for the program, and I'm not good at writing. So... When did you start these? When Winston came. I know they're not very good, but I started and just kept going. I don't know why. Just now I-I realized what I was really drawing. It was me. You say things happen for a reason, that God brings things into our lives to teach us, to get through to us. I always thought I was alone, but- but God brought me you and Winston. Ash, it's time to go. Is this okay? You look great. Hope is alive in you. Love is strong and true. Our faith is growing deeper. All because of you. Hope is alive in you. Mercy real and new. And faith is moving mountains. All because of you. Hope is alive. Love has come to us in Jesus. Hope is burning bright. It freed us from the grip of darkness. To your glorious light. Fall unto our knees and cry you have won the fight. Hope is alive in you. Love is strong and true. Faith is growing deeper. All because of you. Hope is alive in you. Mercy real and new. Faith is moving mountains. All because of you. Hope is alive. You'll do fine. Hi. You look great, honey. Thanks. You really do, Ash. Well, a lot's changed. So Ashley, is there anything you want to tell your parents? When I first left this place, I was drug free. This program helped me with that, but once I was gone I finally saw myself, my weaknesses, insecurities, fears, things that the drugs helped me hide from myself. If you hadn't made me go to Diane's, I wouldn't have found the missing piece, God. Broken. Where do you turn when you've been broken? How do you go on? Broken. What do you do with shattered shards of plane. Oh, how do you find your way. Through the ruins of your life? How do you survive? Broken. Broken. Who will understand when you've been broken? How can you explain it, broken? Why do you feel pain? When your heart is turned to stone. Oh, how do you walk alone. Through the ruins of your life? How do you survive? Oh, Lord, I'm falling at your feet I see you broken dying for me. Oh, my redeemer how you suffered. Broken I could never understand how your heart was broken, When the Father turned away. Broken I could never understand the pain. Of hanging on a cross so. Lamb of God. You sacrificed your whole life. Oh, Lord, I'm falling at your feet I see you broken dying for me. Oh, Lord, I'm falling at your feet. Oh, my redeemer how you suffered. Oh, Lord, I'm falling at your feet I see you dying broken for me. And I know you understand. You understand.
