That's right... legendary soul surfer Steve Addington... - "The Nature Boy." After six months of surfing around the world on the biggest and most famous breaks... Teahupoo, Raglan, J-Bay, Mundaka, Frigates... he's surfed it all. Malibu's own Steve Addington is coming home. The Ben and Barry poster-boy is now signed with surfing icon and television producer Eddie Zarno. Malibu, California, is now hosting the coolest reality show of the summer. The best surfers from around the globe will be living in this house... and partying with these girls. Welcome back, Add-Man. We'll see you soon. Woman: Next. Occupation? Surfer. Is that a job: surfer? Not really. What were you doing in Fiji? Surfing epic lefts at Frigates. Where'd the cash come from? That's from Ben and Barry. Who's Ben and Barry? I wear Ben's shorts, right? Surf Barry's boards. Those dudes send me checks. How long you staying stateside? Long enough to catch some buglass, check in with my brothers, keep the stoke. You know? Stoke? Stoke. You know. Uh-huh. Welcome home. Cool. Man: Check this out, man. - # Do you feel it in the sunshine? # - This fucking asshole. - # Do you feel it in the rain? # - Fuck off, man. # Do you feel it in the ocean # # When the waves are clean? # # Do you feel it in the evening # # When the moon is up? # # Do you feel it in your bones # # When she fills you up? # # Ooh yeah yeah # # She breathes good luck # # Mother Earth, Mother Earth... # - Hello? - Dude. Addington! It's the muffler you wanted. It's classic. No, I like it. It's just... I'm looking for something with a little more boom, you know? # Do you feel it when you... # Get the fuck out of my shop. # Do you feel it on the mountains? # - I love your hose. - Thank you. - # Do you feel it on the water? # - Excuse me. - What? - # Ooh yeah yeah... # All: Yeah! Long time! Long time! # Ooh yeah yeah # # She's breathes good luck, Mother Earth, Mother Earth # # She breathes good luck # # Ooh yeah yeah # # She breathes good luck # # Mother Earth, Mother Earth # # She breathes good luck... # Man, Addy's home. - Jacko, man! - Jack. All: Hey! - Hey, mate. - Yeah. Where's Luanne and the kids? You bring 'em? Oh, no, changing diapers, wiping spit... Beware of what you love, brother, because it can drive you mad. Listen... hey, you talk to Ben and Barry? No. They stoked? Stoked? No. They're gone. - They die? - No no. They sold out to Eddie Zarno. They're poolside at the Four Seasons in Bali getting their grendals twisted... Eddie Zarno... surfer, Eddie Zarno? He's cool, right? Well, you know what? We hope he's cool because, dude, as your manager, I'm telling you, we got worries. We got financial worries, bro. Not today we don't, brother. I just got back in town. I got no... - We got worries, dude. - Let's talk business tomorrow. Definitely tomorrow, bro. No worries, brother. Come here, give me a hug. - Here we are. - Okay, bro. - Mmmm! - Okay. - No worries. - You're right. I don't know why I'm stressing. Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be cool, man. # Ooh yeah yeah # # She breathes good luck # # Mother Earth, Mother Earth. # Hey, Charlie. How's it going? Man: Hello, Danielle. I thought we'd talk about your decision to work in Los Angeles. What's the joke? California, like "granola"? What ain't nuts and fruits is flakes. You could use a little granola, Dad. When's the last time you wore a pair of shorts out? Honey, I just think that you're being rash. Anything that you can learn there, you can learn at one of my companies. I mean, Malibu and reality television? That's... that's your decision? Exactly. Well, I give you one week with those weirdos. Man: I don't want to be unreasonable, bro, but there's waves. Okay, but, dude, you have completely tarnished the California work ethic. Bro, I know you're trying to run a mowing business and all, - but there's swell. - I just want you to know, dude, you just harshed my morning mellow, okay? Jack, please, don't be unreasonable. I'll mow the fucking lawn later. What's going on... Page 35, "Killer Surf." Well, so, if you get time, why don't you come on in and do your job? It's going off in Leo, Jack... Dude, when's the last time you had a wave? There's no telling, bro. I mean, these guys are not exactly committed to lawn care. Most of these machines are on the fritz. I got bills up to my crack. And Luanne is pissed at me. And just, this Ben and Barry situation... I'm gonna lose my mind. - I'm gonna lose my mind. - Let's blow through this, bro. some decent swell. Dude, let's take a moment and assess the situation. You have no assets, you have no savings, you rent your Malibu pad and you're way too generous with your cash. Stuff's like manure, bro: you don't spread it around, - it starts to... ...stink up the place. But, dude, we need fertilizer. We gotta, like, fertilize the money tree so it can keep growing. About that, bro, could you float me a few bills, man? Yeah. Yeah, sure, dude, but look... Ah, you know, Zarno... we gotta go see him. And... and... and if we don't make a deal, then we're gonna be wiped out. Wiped out? Come on, Jacko. Well... ooh! No. But, like, you know, you... you have got to go shake Zarno's hand. Okay. Just spendthrifty, okay? Listen, bro... Brother, I got no trouble shaking a surfer's hand. Ha ha ha! Mmm. This is Zarno's pad, dude? - You cool? - Yeah. Anyway, it's his reality house. Dude, the gray on gray... I mean, like, gray does... Something's wrong with these fish, dude. Gentlemen. Eddie Zarno. My apologies. Conference call with the board... launch details, marketing emergencies. - It happens. - Yeah. I told them to stick it for a minute 'cause Steve Addington and his representation were in my den. - And hey, dude, this place rocks. - Yeah. Man, I was telling Jack, I saw footage of you in Sardinia crushing Porto Ferro, bro. Man, killer cutback. Cool, yeah. Now I cut deals. That's what I'm talking about. Jack Mayweather. God damn! Only Steve Addington could have a manager so cool. - I don't know... - Mr. Zarno? Excuse me. Yeah? - Mr. La Rosa's asking for evidence. - Good, right? Oh, God. All right. Guys, I'm sorry. I got some more hand-holding to do. Margaret, my assistant, will show you around, show you the house, show you the game... you. Guys, we'll talk soon. All right? Cool guy. Gentlemen? Follow me. This is our nerve center. You can see the entire home here on our monitors... weight room, kitchen, our spacious grounds. Ah, that's your room, Steven. You have a perfect view of Malibu's Point Dume from both windows. The house is early Klaus Woo. - Who? - Woo. - Oh. - Post-post-modernist revival. - Jack: Oh. - Notice the strong lines and the perfect circles, as if to conjure the line of the horizon and the molecules. The house used to belong to a very distinguished porn star... This place is so... - so... - Okay? Gentlemen. This place is so... Have you ever experienced a first-person-emersion video game? I've dropped a few quarters into Donkey Kong. This place is so... pretty. Follow me. We're calling it "Free Surfer." It's in beta, available next Christmas. Catchy title. Put them on your head. I don't want to put them on my head. It's the future. It's the future, bro. Take a peek. All right. Welcome to the digital revolution. Right. Whoa. April May. It's going off. Whoa, bro. You all right? Ahh. I don't mean to be complaining 'cause we're not complainers, but I was curious... what exactly do you need Add here for? Ahh. We can simulate surfing, but we can't simulate great surfing without great surfers. Oh. Oh. Now that makes sense. Please. - Whoo. - Jack: Ho ho ho ho ho. - Man: Nice. Nice. - Hey, Zarno went all out, huh? Look at this... that's La Rosa. He's finishing a sequencing session. That's how we capture your personal surfing style. That's how we'll create the Addington avatar. He's a good surfer, man. Hard charger. What's happenin', bro? Thought you'd be better looking, have longer arms or something. I can't hear you, bro. Gracias, mam. It's my world now, mamao. Man: We need you in hair and makeup. Wow. - Dude looks upset. - Truly. Man: Okay, people, let's reset the rig... Looks cold in there, bro. - Frigid. - Man: Uh, sorry, there's no smoking in here. Man: Brill, shut it. Baker, please. Addington, continue. Ben and Barry wouldn't digitize me. That's Steve Addington. - Man: Brillo, please... - The surfer. ...I will come over there. I'll tell you something else, man: Video games, reality TV, Free Surfer... I mean, what the fuck is that, man? I'm not some ass-clown in a green room. - I'm a surfer, dude. - Man: Yes. Hi. - I'm Stacey. - Brillo: Good day. - This is my friend Danni. - Hello. - Hey, how are you? - Hey. Stacey: We're working for the reality show. - East Coast? - New York. Do you mind if we shoot you? No, roll away. So you're not going to do Free Surfer? I hear La Rosa's getting over $100,000 in residuals... - What? - $100,000? ...and exposure worth twice that. - Yeah! It's like getting a map to buried treasure. Except it's not buried. It's dangling there like a big fat grape. - I love grapes. - But who picked that grape, bro? Seriously, migrants, you know? Exploited farmers, man. La Rosa's little niece probably had to pick that grape, man, - in Oxnard. - Man: Dude. Steve: Wow. - Not feeling it. - Man: Yeah. Not into it. I just want to surf, keep the stoke day to day. Man: Quality thinking, man. You get all that? Got it. Later, East Coast. - See ya. - Bye. Nice meeting you. Blowing it. Blowin' it. - Add-Man. - Farmer Bob. Get in this house. - From my garden, brother. - Homegrown. Thank you very much. Speaking of homegrown... "au naturale." Under the sun... Topanga Gold. Bless the flowers... - Bless the weed. Amen to that, brother. ...bless the weed. How long we got you for? I'm gonna chill local-style for awhile... the summer, at least. Yeah. The usual for the goats. Keep 'em on the farm roaming free. You're way too generous. They call it "courtesy" for a reason, brother. Wanna paddle out? It's been a while. I best be about my father's business. Cool. Me too, brother. Me too. - What goes down... ...gotta come up! April May, look at you. - Look at you. - Ahh. Did you feel that wind kick up? El Nio may be paying us an early visit. I heard you're gonna be one of the surfers on the reality show. Nn-nnh. Nah, I'm gonna stay here, surf and work the garden. Just picture it, okay? You and me, the stars of it, - just rulin' it. - Mmm. Promise me you'll think about it. Aha ha ha. - To the waves. - Jesus. She hurts me, bro. I don't know about her, dudes. She's the siren, bro. I want to mark her with my scent like a lemur. This helps. Steve: I'm not some ass-clown... ...l'm a surfer, dude. - That's excellent footage. - Stacey: Thanks. It's really useful stuff. Kind of a scoop there, isn't it? Which one of you was behind the camera here at the end? - Um, you did. - Me. Stacey: I was actually interviewing and she was... - Would you excuse us a minute? ...video games, reality TV... - So... Danni, is that right? - Yeah. You're obviously educated, smart... cultured perhaps. I did my thesis on vertical integration: owning production through distribution and retail. Yeah, well, lesson one: get the content. Well, you know that already, don't you? So did Addy say anything else? Anything off-camera? No, except what he said which was pretty much "No." Right, well, he's playing hard to get. He'll come around. They all come around eventually. Looked like you two had a little moment. I'm sorry? I saw the tape, the way he looked at you. Are you gonna deny it? Yeah, I deny it. You can go now. La Rosa: Wave that money! You look so beautiful. Mira. Ay, coo, mam, you ever taste La Rosa, baby? It's like Sabritos, but better. That's right! Pa', Eddie, dla. - Hey, ladies. - Chocolate y Snowflake. Announcer: Surfers living and partying... - Hey! Hey hey! ...under one roof, - fighting for waves on one beach. - Addington, Addington! - Addington! - 24 hours a day, it's one sizzling summer. It's gonna be hot. Australia's big-wave rider, Johnny Doran... Johnny: I like huge waves, Catholic sheilas and beets on my burger. I love that guy. ...Lupe La Rosa: shredder sensation from Puerto Rico... Hey, kids, how you doin'? You want my autograph? Who wants some Red Bull, huh? Yeah! Just business. That's "Lupe." ...and Malibu's own legendary soul surfer, Steve Addington. Who? He's scared I outsurf him. Hey, Steve! - It's... ...going... ...off. Premiering this summer, from the mind of surf icon, Eddie Zarno. All: What! Watching that. Thought you passed on the wave porn, bro. I did. Dude, we saw it and we loved it and, you know, I'm still not sure why you're down on this show. I said no, dude. I know, bro, but, like... he's pissed, you know? Zarno apparently got ahold of some video of you passing on his project in a way that didn't sit too well with him. Yeah, I said "No dice" in no uncertain terms, and I meant it. Why do you want to discriminate against all those poor landlocked kids like in Kansas who are gonna watch you on this thing and realize that there is something cooler in the world than a house made of corn? What? Dude, how are you sitting for cash? A handful. Well, then why don't you just stroll on down the hill and smile and be charming and be cool and be Addington, you know? Maybe something cool will happen. Man, like I said, I got no problem shaking a surfer's hand, brother, but I'm not living there. Cool? Okay, dude, but remember: mind open, heart enlarged, soul receptive. - I love you. - You too, brother. All: Please. Please. You're killing me, man. - Let's go. - Boom! Ho ho ho! # You see me? # - Whoa! - I love America. I had no idea. Yes! Excuse me? You put the green pepper, red pepper, garlic, onion, y mucho amor... you need the loving in your life, papi, right? Anybody know where Eddie is? Oye, mamao, can't you see I'm cooking? What's up, La Rosa, bro? Man, I saw you talking trash on TV the other day. What gives? "What gives"? I'll tell you what gives. You and your free-surfing-country-soul vibe, that's what gives. It's about 30 years late, papi. That shit can't compete. I'm not competing, bro. Well, I'm not buying it, bro. I ain't selling it. Oh, whoa whoa. I need all cameras in the kitchen. You got nothing I need. Hey. I thought about what you said and we're just not gonna work out. - Ooh. - What? I'm with Lupe now. I'm sorry. I'm just looking for Eddie, man. You can go home and cry now, Steven. - Hey, dude. - Aw, man. - It's good to see you again, Steven. - Likewise. It really is. We're excited to have you... the coolest surfer in the world. Yeah. - Hard work, fella! - That's right, fella! Come on. Grass is perfect and we cut it, man. Why? You used to walk everywhere yourself, huh? - You stopped, man. Why'd you stop? - Oh, no. Was it that reef bounce at Mavs, man? Oh, you heard about that. Saw that. It was heavy, man. Steven, Ben and Barry asked me to personally take care of you. Not that they had to, 'cause numbers don't lie. - Numbers? - Numbers, Steven. It's all about the, numbers. And yours, my friend, add up. - Margaret? - Yep? Just need your signature on these saying you'll participate fully in my projects. Dude, we were just chilling, surfer to surfer. There are times in life when years of preparation meet the moment of opportunity. This is that moment for you. Checks. This is actually stoked, bro. What up, bro? Those are for me, aren't they? They're for you, yes, as soon as you sign, saying you'll participate in Free Surfer and live in my house. I told you, man, I'm not signing. I'm not participating, you know? It's not personal, Eddie. I'm trying to tell you, I'm... I surf. All right, I'm a surfer... out there. Steven, I want you to remember something here, and don't forget this, huh? You're in advertising. Ben and Barry never paid you to surf. Jack's got my number. You tell him to call when you start "feeling it." Heeeeey. Wait a minute. What about that? What about that? I was acting. They told me to play like I wanted him. But I want you there. You do? What do you want? That's good there. Truly epic night, brothers. I just want to go on record... Report said "surf." That's a lake. Oh, bro. Something's off, dudes. No bueno, mate. No bueno. Msica, msica. Come on, party, people. Follow me. Lupe's so cool. Aww! Back to the sofrito, mi gente, because I did not forget about you. Man: We got 20 cameras outside. We can cut to anything we want. We edit as we go. There's hardly any post. It's sexy, it's happening, it's fast. We got... I mean, we can... if anything gets old, like... like this. Hello? Come on, I don't want shots of girls talking. Is this better? Good. That shit goes across demographics, huh? And next week, Addington drops in. Boom... it's fantastic. What the fuck? Hey, man, look... Socrates recommended the dialectic when faced with such an impasse, man. You know? You ask me a question, I respond with something to build on and a conversation is formed, out of which answers are revealed. Mm-hmm. Where are the waves? I don't know, man. Something's bogus, dudes. B-O-G-U-S. I gotta compensate. "No entiendo," dude. No no no, he speaks of reciprocity, bros... balance in the energy that binds us, man. There are no separate deeds, man. You know, read Heisenberg, man. You know, we affect... by looking at that tree, you affect that tree, man. You make it real, man. Yeah yeah, thanks. You've been really helpful. Sacrifices, bro. Measure for measure. I gotta take action. Whoa whoa whoa, what kind of action? No more women till we get waves. Yeah, good one. No more weed, either, not till we get waves. Hey, you know, let's not take it too far, man. First off, fuck that. And second off, yeah, fuck that. There's philosophy and then there, you know, there's life, man... Why don't you just blow my fucking balls off? - and physics, man. Butterfly effect, man. Mate, you're the ass-cutting chosen one. Hey, stone crab... you love stone crab, huh? You could stop eating stone crab. - Right. - Give it up. No, bros. I'm fasting. - I got nothing. - I got nothing. Ah, we gotta vacate. Indo, Gold Coast... wherever it's going off... I'm taking us. - That means we're gonna surf? - That means we're gonna surf. - Did Jack Mayweather call? - No, sir. Okay, tell Perez to prep the Addington tape. Yes, sir. And tell him to cancel his plans for the evening. Yes, sir. And put a hold on his expense accounts. Whose? - Addington's. - Oh, yes, of course. Sorry. Um, which ones? All of them. Went to Surf Liquor. Fucknut must have frozen your tab there too. Really upset Baker. That tab was the one pure thing in my life. Herb will get you through times with no money better than money will get you through times with no herb. I tried. I looked. I called. I met. No one can touch you with Zarno owning your contracts. I need waves, Jack. Waves. Hey, what about that sticker thing? You know? The logo idea. Oh, that's kinda... personal, isn't it? Exactly. Great. Man, he loves you. It's just... it's probably just a communication problem. Tell him that you will push the product. That's money to him. I mean, it's all we got. I don't know what else to do. Hey! - Mmm. - Hey. - "Under the sun." - Yeah. Everything is under it, right? The surf, chicks, good loving, good times... anything you're into, happening "au naturale" - under... ...the sun. - The sun! - The sun! Yeah. And it's something that Addington has been so mad passionate about for, like, ever. Stickers. You can put it on anything. - You know, your television... - Surfboard. - Your wall. - Your laptop. Your dog. If you shave it. Okay. Okay, all right. Look... wow. Well, I've listened, I've considered, and the answer's no. Not feelin' it. Now are you ready to come to work or what? - Dude... - Excuse me. ...be cool. What's it gonna be? Fun under my sun or Fuck City? Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa, dude. Wait a minute, man. I'm seriously about to pound you. Man, do you understand that? Are you gonna turn my travel card back on - or what? - Okay. Whoa whoa. Mama! Here we go! Here we go. This is the anger I've been looking for. This is the big-wave passion I need for the show. Huh? Oh, it's beautiful. It's beautiful, anger. Am I right? Yeah, fantastic anger. Really good stuff. - What the fuck? - You're gonna love this. - Roll the tape. - I'll tell you something else: Surfing's lame, dude. - Surfers... they're ass-clowns. - Enjoy. And I'm not feeling it. Not into it. Into video games, reality TV. Lying cocksucker fascist bastard asshole - son of a crooked fuck. - They're ass-clowns. I'm gonna kill him! And I'm not feeling it. Not into it. Into video games... Eddie: Oh my God. Oh, baby, the magic of montage. How was that for a moment, huh? You cannot do this, - you unethical, unprincipled... - Careful. ...scumbag asshole. - Fired. - No shit. Those with the gold make the rules, sweetpea. - Remember that. ...surfing's lame... Cut to three here. I want to see it. Man: Going to three. - Eddie: Hello, Steven. ...not feeling it. Jack? Man: Hey, we got some Free Surfer hoodies for you at the end of the hall there, if you're getting cold. ...video games and reality TV. Man: Look, it's King Shit. ...surfing's lame. Whuh-oh! It's macho man. You got cajones, papi. - Here we go. - Addington, this has got to stop. - You're sort of stalking me. - What? You messing around with my bitch, mamao? Nothing happened. Believe me, he tried. Hi, East Coast, you seen Jack? Whoa whoa whoa! Lupe: Yeah, baby! Coo! That's the one-hitter quitter, papi. How you like that? Good night, Steven. Addington? Steve? I can't believe this is happening. This is so great. Please, I feel awful. - Jack? - He's with the police. He threw a brick at Zarno's car. His car? He threw it at Zarno. A brick? And a bottle. They took him to jail. - Addington? - Danni? Steve Addington just said your name with his dying breath. This is so romantic. It's like a Jane Austen novel. Hey. Man: Welcome to Breakline. To check for surf, press one. Those breaks are flat flat flat and flat. - Hey. - Oh. Ah, hi. Um, good morning. Excuse me, who are you? I'm Stacey. - Right. - You're in my apartment... me and Danni's. Oh. Hey, Stacey, did... did we... Oh, um, yeah... no. But you're up now. Juice? No. Thank you, though. - Muffin? - I'm fasting. No. Hey, Luanne. Why are those dudes driving off with Jack's mowers? We have many lawns but no one to push them. I don't know what else to do. Business is bad. We need the money. I have to go, Addington. I have to visit Jack in jail now. Oh, it's all right, baby. Oh, Jack. That's fucking Steve Addington right there, man. That long-haired hippie was talking shit on YouTube. Throw your fucking burrito at him. Eat that, ass-clown. Boy: Enjoy the breakfast! Hello? Hello? It's Danni. Hello? Steve? You okay? Quick, don't just do something; stand there. What? I'm waiting. but I'm trying not to even do that. What is that, like, Zen or something? It's whatever waiting without waiting is. What are you waiting for? Waves. Well, I'm sorry, Steve... - but, you know, I was just listening to the radio and they said there isn't gonna be a rideable wave on the California coast for days, at least. South, maybe, in Mexico. Mexico. - You got wheels? - Um, do... do... Uh, I got Stacey's... Stacey's truck. Yeah yeah yeah. I know a cat. If it's breaking in Baja, it's breaking at Greenbough's. Go to Mexico! Mexico! Ahem. Danni: Can I just say something? I feel I need to apologize for what happened with Zarno and my footage. I did not... No, I know, I know. It's cool. You don't want an explanation? I didn't say what they had me saying, so I don't need that explained to me. Check that glovebox. Go on. Yeah. Man: Mr. Zarno, there are three guys at the gate looking for Addington. I think they're friends of his. - Shall I let them in? - Yes. Are you kidding me? Yes, let them in, definitely. And ask them where the fuck is Addington? Lupe: Of course, ladies, you can lick Lupe. Anytime... Oh, mira! The three mamaos. Yeah, let them in. It's okay. Ladies, continue licking. Don't stop. Ahhhh! - Ahhh! - Oh! Hi. You scared me. Best to breathe, then... deeply. There's nothing we can do for him, Chip. The transplant didn't take. We're lifeguards, not lawyers. Hello? - Hi. - Where's my truck? I am so sorry. I took it to Mexico with Steve Addington. - Stacey? - You disgusting slut! Okay, um, I can't really talk right now, but I will be back as soon as I can. I promise. Is that okay? Not without details, it isn't. And I mean right now. - I gotta go. - No no no no no no... No! Americano? What you do in tree? Looking for waves, buddy. Waves are in ocean, not tree. No, waves are not in ocean, buddy... so I'm in tree. Hey, americano, We make big crazy fire. Look at him... it would break my heart if he didn't look so pathetic. When he was yea high, he'd hitch rides down from Topanga, watching us surf till the last wave. His mom left him up there with some far-out folks who let him grow up outside, follow what he loved. - And he loved to surf. - Boy: Is crazy. Like it answered all his questions. Americano? Until now. So there's never been a drought like this before? Nah... not for him. Boy: No! No no no no... So how come you're not going crazy then? I mean, you're a surfer too. I fish. Add's got nothing but waves. Whoa! Qu pas? Are you okay? I think I put too much gas on it. Mi corazon's... it's muy heavy. I know, amigo. I know. Boy: Americano, no hay nada all! There is nothing there! - Yes, a huge show. - Man: Right. - A hit show; it'll go through the roof. - Yes, I know... - Huge ad buy... - Eddie, I know, I know! Listen, where is this guy, Steve Addington? Addington? Yeah, Addington! Listen, Simons says... - Yeah. ...you promised him Addington. He's seeing La Rosa on the tape. He's not seeing Addington. Listen, I will have Steve Addington under control very soon. Under control! What the fuck does that mean? Man: Dressed from head to foot in black. # Break it up, wind it up, one, two, three # # Now you're ready to roll with me... # Hurry up, Brillo. Guapa, mi gente, huh? Fuck if you're cutting, La Rosa. Yeah, "da da da da da da da!" Don't think so, "papi." Pero, amigos, we're friends, right? Familia? How is he? Not very good. He hasn't eaten anything and he's pacing. Pacing? That's bad. - This was good. - What's that? Well... this is a big, fucking monster bud. That's what it is. Hey, Add? Yeah? I scored this for you, son. Sweet. Let's thread up some morning earth and burn. All right, I'm gonna go thread it up, but I gotta pass on the weed, though. I'm fasting. Yeah. What's so special about surfing? Steve: What's so special about the wind? Surfing is to... be with that mystery, to ride that mystery for as long as you can. And when it's over, that's cool, 'cause you know you were there... in line and on time. # Why she does # # What she does... # - Steve: Feel that? - What? See that? No. They're coming. They're coming. Waves are coming. We're surfing. We are surfing tomorrow. Yeah! # Right now a ripple would be fine # # She make me fall so in love # # She got me riding so high # # Test my patience just because # # She knows that she's the only one # # That's on my side, yeah # # Why she does # # What she does. # Good morning. 'Morning. Sorry. Think we could head back soon? I feel bad about Stacey's truck. Slow, wide turns, brother. Espero que encuentras lo que buscas. Later, bro! Reporter on radio: We've gone from a low-pressure system to a no-pressure system in the Northern Hemisphere. There is nothing new to report but a possible record-breaking amount of days without waves. Once again, folks, pray for surf. Hey, you know how to get a dude to go surfing? Not a clue. You just say, "Dude, it's going off." It's going off. You can't forget the "dude" part. Lets someone know what kind of dude is asking them to go surfing. Dude. Okay. Got it. Later, East Coast. Was he good? I'm serious. Then what are you talking about? Why are you here? It's Steve Addington. You've got to get on that again at least once. Shut up. No, seriously, you gotta keep on hitting that until the hitting is done. Vic: Whoa, a dustbowl. Addington? - Yoo-hoo! - Yo, Add? Vic: Me, I sweat like a bear in Panama. What kind of world, right, that kicks a... kicks a man out of his house? Are you cool? I'm really moved... you dudes came over. Love and waves... that's what we need in these dark days, man, is love... and waves. And some hairy buds, bro. And some hairy bud, man. Uh, cops behind us. - Be cool, man. - Be cool. All: Be cool, be cool, be cool. Be cool, be cool, be cool. Be cool. Fuck! Uh... uh, I'm pulling over. - Somebody bail with the weed. - Hey! Man: Too fast... too fast, dude. Too fast, too fast. - They'll deport me. - Dude. Vic: On three, we scatter. One, two, three! Ahh. Policeman: Hey, litterbug, found your marijuana. Policeman #2: Is it yours? Technically, no. Freeze, hippie! - Don't you lie to us. - All right, all right, man. You're right. It is mine. I was holding it. I tossed it. Yeah, it's mine. Aren't you Steve Addington? - What? - That famous surfer? Yeah. You suck, bitch! That's right, mamao! It's Lupe! I pimped you, bitch! Someone tell me what the fuck is going on. Come on, bro, I need you to pick it up a little bit here. All right? We're gonna make some money with this shit. Call me a "beaner" or something. Liven up, dude. Come on. You dudes are in on this? - Waves, man. - Nothing but waves. - In a game, man. - Free Surfer, dude. All the time, all day. Man, it's some kind of digital alchemy. Baker: Yeah yeah yeah! Barrels of love, baby. - Vic: Where you wanna go, man? - Aw, dudes. It is Lupe time! Where you going, papi? It's okay... grass grows, birds fly and Addington runs from my beauty. It's okay. It's an easy thing to run from 'cause I'm so gorgeous! A little rain, storm clouds, low front... you know, perfect. So it's a great business opportunity, but the guy's a real wheeler-dealer, right? Yes, he's a scumbag, but his business model is strong. He's perfectly positioned, really. All: Oh, Addington, Addington... - Are you shitting me? - Yes, he says he wants to talk. - He's at the main gate now. - Ha! All right, all right. Get the contracts ready. - Get the cameras ready too. - Okay. Yes! Addington... I love this guy. Okay, we're gonna need you to sign here, here and here. And I do this, you... turn it all back on, right? I mean, the travel card, the checks? You live in my house for the last two weeks, you let me digitize you for Free Surfer, dude, I will put you back on your throne of cool. Pick a break, anywhere in the world, you're on a plane the day we wrap. What about my brothers? They come too? On the house. How about Jack? I'm not signing shit until I know he's out. Good. He just left processing... all the charges have been dropped. - Jacko? - Hey, Add. Man, you free? Ha ha, yeah, bro! I'm free. Thank you. I don't know what you did, but, boom... they let me out. I'm gonna sign these contracts, Jack. Dude... dude, don't sign anything. Don't sign... I would rather go back to jail, Add. If I beg you on my knees... I'm not on my knees 'cause it's concrete, dude, but do not... do not sign those contract... Add? Add? You're doing the right thing, my friend. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Let's do it, man. Come in. Danni? Man: Okay, Mr. Addington, you have a favorite break? Any break in the world. Oh, yeah. Uh, and what is it? I'm not telling you, dude. Oh. Okay. I'll just pick one. So act naturally and if you feel any nausea, dizziness or pain in the chest, let us know. Here we go. # Whooo! # He sees it. You ready? Come on, pop it, man. # Whoo! # Come on. Come on. What the fuck is he doing? - # Whooo! # - Addington? No no, Addington... What... Addington? God damn it. Addington! God damn it! - Fuck. - Ahhh! He fucking bailed. # Whooo! # No no no no! Where is he going? God damn it! Come on, get a camera. Find his fucking ass now. # Whooo! # Farmer Bob? How many are there? You wanted them roaming free, so there they are... roaming free. Dude... - who mows your grass? - Hmm? They do. At ease, at ease. Carry on. So where's Addington, huh? Besides his nuts, I mean, which I got right here. Mr. Simons is here... with another gentleman. - Mr. Sim... - Mm-hmm. Wait. - New York Simons? - Mm-hmm. - He's here? - Mm-hmm. We were as surprised as anybody, but Mr. Martin made the offer and they jumped at it. - Happened just like that. - All... all right. Well, what happens now? Your company falls under Mercer's DSK Enterprises. Yeah, this is good. This is very good. Growth is good. You got the muscle to move some product here. That's what I've been talking about. Huh? What do you know about the surfing industry, Mr. Martin? - Not much. Nn-nnh. - Nnn? Tell me about Steve Addington. Steve Addington? Well, he's a big-name surfer. Little difficult to work with, but I own... well, we own his image and image is reality, so we own his reality. Just gotta squeeze it a bit harder, that's all. From what I hear, Mr. Addington is surfing. And more importantly, he's cool and cool sells. And when you defame and slander Mr. Cool, well, that's bad for business. I don't... I don't... I agree, I guess. Of course I do, but, um... I would dispute that we... I would dispute... I would dispute that it came from us. Eddie, how about you show us around? Yes, please. And why don't we start at the front door? Okay, sure. Yeah, fine, let's... I'm a surfer, dude. Video games, reality TV, Free Surfer... I mean, what the fuck is that, man? I'm not some ass-clown in a green room. I'm a surfer, dude. Yes. Look at it this way, Eddie. You have been relieved, but with all this free time, maybe you can pick up surfing again. Oh, and you've met my daughter Danni. Your... Wait, that was... Oh my God. Ah, that's so... You can go now. Security will show you out. You know what? All of you... you can all just take a flying fuck. - I'm a surfer, dude. - Good girl. # Come, my brother, come slowly # # Come easy, my friend # # Come, my friend # # Come, my sister # # Come easy, come busy... # He's here. Oh! The worm has turned, bro. # Take your heart out, let go, come let go # # Come, my sister, can I hold you... # Goats? Those are your new mowers, bro. No, bro... I think I need more than two. Well, more than two, you got, brother. They cut, they fertilize, they cut, they fertilize, - they cut and... - And they fertilize. # Come let go # - # Come the winter, come summer... # - Addington! # Come autumn, come spring, do your thing... # That clip was bullshit, man. I threw a breakfast burrito at you, bro. Sorry, dude. - It's cool. - Right on, man. # Whooo! # Waves, bro! - # Whooo! # - Waves? - Waves. - Waves. # Whooo! # # Hey! # # Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo # # Come, my brother, put your hands up # # Take your heart out, let go # # Come let go # # Come, my sister, can I hold you? # # Can I squeeze you? # # Let go, come let go... # These contracts, they're not binding, but my offer still stands. I say, I dig your vibe, Mr. Martin, I do, and I appreciate your offer. But me and Jack over there... we let him handle all the business deals. Understood. I gotta tell you, though, bro to bro... if it wasn't for this chick... - What? A girl? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, charged and peaceful all at the same time, - kind of like the ocean. - Ha. Speaking of, there she is right now, on time. Ah... That's... that's my daughter, Steve. - She's your daughter? - Mm-hmm. Dude, you're stoked. It's going off, dude. - Later, dude. - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, boy. - Mr. Mayweather? - Oh, Mr. Martin. I've been going over these contracts and... who are Ben and Barry? Well, step into my office.

Maybe we'll all go to dinner after or something, maybe. - Korean barbeque. - Ah, Korean barbeque. That's what I was thinking. Okay, we'll get him in the water... Okay, it's time for you to do your thing. Things are looking good over here. I thought you said it was made by some soulful dudes. No no no, I said "dudes from Seoul," bro. Yeah. It's a hacked bomber, man. It's got a bee on it, man. You know? Nine skegs. Look, bro, do me a favor... get on that damn thing and ride it, all right?
