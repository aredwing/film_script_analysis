That's right, man. It's gasoline. Yeah, come on. Torch him, man. No. Mrs. Gaultier, I'm sorry this had to happen to your family. We've done everything that can be done. In cases like this it is very difficult to make any kind of prediction, so for the next couple of months it's going to be touch and go. Mrs. Gaultier... The insurance has expired, I know. Does he have any other relatives, anyone else that could possibly help? No. Come on, Nicole. Let's go. Lyon. Lyon. Lyon? Lyon! Lyon! Hi, Lyon. I bet you're wondering what's in the old goodie sack for you today, huh? Let's have a look. There we go. Legionnaire Lyon Gaultier. Yes. It's very nice. No interest, eh? Okay, back she goes. Yeah, Gaultier, that's me. This one's been out in the sun too long. She said she tried to call me two weeks ago. Nobody told me. Why? This is the Foreign Legion, Gaultier, not Club Med. We're talking about my brother. He could be dead by now. And we could be at war with the bloody wogs tomorrow. I need your ass here. Your brother is not my problem. Or yours anymore. You gave up your family when you joined the Legion. I never gave up my family. Never. Legionnaire, I don't have time for this Scheie. I need to see my brother. You need what I tell you you need. And right now, I think you need two weeks' hard labor. Starting tomorrow. You want something else to cry about legionnaire? We can arrange it. You only have six months left in the Legion, Gaultier. Don't make it six years. You're a real asshole. Is there a problem, sir? No, no, no, no, no. No problem. Desert fever, this is your real problem. Too many weeks in the hot sun. Shall we try sweatbox, sir? Yes, this might help. Just until his fever breaks. Cover your head, Legionnaire. Move. Your belt. Come on. Move! Your hotel room is ready. Let's go. Come on. Okay. Get me a fucking jeep! There is no sign of him, sir. He'll never make it. If the wogs don't kill him, then the desert will. Just in case, head down to the docks first thing in the morning. The ocean's his only way out of the country. Moustafa, go this way. Hey! Get your ass back down below! Get down to those boiler rooms now! Okay, okay. This ain't no pleasure cruise. Move your ass! The letter was from his sister-in-law. We are fortunate. Our intelligence section makes a habit of recording the return addresses. We'll contact the Americans and ask them to keep her under surveillance. Inspector, this man is a deserter, a traitor to France and a goddamn terrorist. Adjutant, all I can do is transmit the word. If the Los Angeles cops aren't too busy busting dope dealers, gang rapists and serial killers maybe they will have time to bring the asshole in. And if they don't, tough shit. If they do not, maybe I can help. You stay off the top deck, First Mate's orders. You were told not to come up. Am I right? Yeah. And you told me that ship's gonna go to Los Angeles. What difference does it make? You ain't got no green card, you ain't got no visa. You ain't getting off this boat anywhere, Frenchie. So get your ass below before somebody reports you, a deserter, stowed away on their ship. I pay for the trip. I'm being generous Frenchie. You keep stocking my boilers or you'll be breaking rocks in the hot sun. Now, what's it gonna be? It's going to be simple. Hey, maybe we make a deal. You've been so generous to me. Huh? America. Los Angeles Information. Please deposit $2.40. No, no. It's my sister-in-law. She's waiting for me, Helene Gaultier. Honey, I don't care if she's the mayor's sister-in-law. If I don't hear the coins, this is the end of the conversation, you got it? Hey! Come on, come on! Come on, get in there. Come on. Come on, get up. What are you doing? Come on. Yeah. Come on, man. Come on, God damn it. I want my money, man! Hey, hey, all right. The man won. You want another fight? You sure you don't want another fight, mother? Look at that, man, you can win.

Bets over, bets over, bets over. All right. Bets over. All right. Look here. You sure you want to do this, my man? I'm the only one betting on you. Don't let me down, now.

Wait, wait, wait a minute, man. You didn't give me enough goddamn money, man. Hey, look here, boy. You're a good fighter, boy. But you can't count worth a shit. God damn it, give me my goddamn money. Hey! The number you have dialled is no longer in service and there's no new number. If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please hang up and dial again. There's nowhere to go. Nobody home? No. Hey, man, don't be looking at the damn sandwich, man. Pick it up and eat it. It ain't gonna hurt you. 'Cause you're Lion, king of the jungle. So you want to get to LA, huh? Yeah. Hey, man. Thank you very much for that, man. Look here, I'll get you back in LA, all right? Thank you for paying for the sandwich. Yeah, sure. It is where you want to go, LA, right?

May I help you, gentlemen? Here to see the lady, man. Uh... You'll have to be a little bit more specific than that. Oh, man, cut the shit. Just tell her Joshua's here with someone I think she'd like to meet. Well, if it ain't old Joshua. My main man. Yeah. How'd you find us? Here, look here, man. Word gets out. You know what I'm saying?

My man don't like talking about himself, you know, where he comes from, any of that mess, you know what I'm saying? Is it cool? Cool.

Hey, now come on, man, you ain't gonna go do shit. Hey, the winner. Ladies and gentlemen, Lyonheart, king of the jungle. Don't ever insult one of my patrons again. If there's something that Russell or I can't handle, we have paid security personnel who can. You clear on that? Yeah. Good. Now, what's this shit about a trip to LA? Because I think I can have another fight lined up for you in less than a week. Better money for everybody this time. But it's up to you, Lyon. I'm going to Los Angeles. What the fuck is in Los Angeles? All right. Can you at least make it back by Tuesday? No. Do us a favor. Talk it over with your manager. My manager? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look here. My man wants to go to LA. What he's got going there is his business. And we'll be back here when we're good and ready to come back here. You understand what I'm saying? Right, my man? Let me tell you all something. What I did tonight I did for my family, not for you, not for me. You made a total of $5,000. That's a pretty substantial amount for a one-night stand. Where else are you gonna make that kind of money? That's my business, not yours. Stop the car. What if we can arrange a fight for you in California? We do have a circuit out there, too. Arrange it for somebody else. And stop the car. That $5,000 won't go as far as he thinks. My private number, in case he changes his mind. Hey, hey, man. Get up off the celebration, will you? Come on, man, you know how far the damn airport is from here? Hey, come on, man. It's just me and you now. I left them other jive turkeys way behind. All right. Hey, look here. I can dig it. Hey, my brother done made me some money, so I'm gonna leave his ass in the damn street. Well, that's all right. That's all right. Go ahead with your bad self. We'll see how far your ass gets without my help, God damn it. Go ahead. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Jive motherfucker. Tonight, I fought for you. Didn't make enough money, huh? Wait a minute. You want some more? Don't be talking about no damn money around here, man. Shit, man, if people find out we've got $10,000 in our pocket, we won't even make it to that damn corner. Man, just put your money back in the pocket, there. That's... Yeah, there. That is just... Yeah, yeah. Look here, man. Hey, look here. Why don't we get a cab out of here, man, right now, all right? Yeah. Come on. Hey, hey, look here. There it is. There's a telephone. That's what we need, man. Hey. Listen to me. Yeah. Listen to me. I'll get you out of this, all right? Yeah. We'll survive. Now come on, man. God is merciful, you know it. Come on, man. Hey, yeah, yeah, hey. Looking for an honest man? I'm him. Never steer you wrong. There it is. See? Hey, man. What is this, man? Shut up, man. Hey, cuz, you want to use our phone? Look, that's all right, blood, we'll go someplace else. Don't worry about it. What, you don't like my phone, cuz? How much you want for your phone? Let me do the talking, man. Hey, shut up, nigger. I want to hear what the white boy got to say. This is my hood, motherfucker, and I ask the questions. How much you want to pay? He ain't got no money, motherfucker. I got the goddamn money. And I'll kick your ass. You ain't getting shit. Motherfucker's gonna pay now. Come on, man. Get in there, man. Today's your lucky day, punk. Yeah, that's right. I want a cab. What, you expect me to walk to the airport? What do you mean, you don't send no cabs to this neighborhood? Wait, are you... Hey, man, you want to use the phone? Come on. Let's go. Hey. You're gonna listen to Joshua now, huh? Yeah. I've been all over the world, man. I've been around. From the Big Apple to the Big Orange, I know the score. How you gonna get around in all that smog? Huh? Them freeways? Now, people in LA, man, lot of shit going on. Lot of weird-ass motherfuckers running around. Besides, I owe you lunch. Yeah, yeah. You owe me lunch. Good. But you're wasting your time if you think I'll fight again. Hey, I can dig it. It's cool. Okay. Okay. $5,000 will go a long ways in the land of sunshine. He is my brother. I want to see Francois now. I understand but we still need to see some identification. I want to see my brother. - What's going on? - Please come with me. Please. It finally happened late last week. With the extent of his injuries, honestly, I don't know how he held on as long as he did. It's because I told him I'd always be there for him. I'm truly sorry. The guys who did this to him, did they catch them? Mr. Gaultier, he's gone, and nothing we can do will bring him back. Doc, my question is, did they catch them? Yes, Mr. Gaultier. I believe the police have them in custody. The guys who set him on fire... might have been... rival drug dealers... they might have been customers that he sold some bad stuff to. It might have been kids playing a sick prank. We may never know. He was too delirious to tell the police much of anything. Now if I were you, I'd be a little more concerned about his wife and his child. He left them with a stack of unpaid medical bills and not too much of anything else. Now I can give you their address, if you'd like. I have it. Thank you. Hey, you don't look sick to me, baby. Hey, Lion. Hey, Lion! Hey. Hey, Lyonheart. Hey, man, what's happening? You acting like they said you were pregnant or something. I don't need you. Just go, okay? Go. Hey. Look there. There he is. Hey, my treat, remember? Damn inflation, man. Look here. Here's $2, man. Keep the change. For your kids. I heard Russell say you don't know when to quit, huh? Hey, that's me, man. That's you. Can't argue with the facts, right? You have nothing better to do? Okay. Maybe you can help me then. Find this place. That's the address. No problem, man. Who lives there? You got a sister? Just find me this place and don't ask too much question. Hey, hold it, man. Hold that goddamn car. Yeah. Motherfucker. Hey. Oh, hey, hey. There it is. There it is. Right there. It's yours? Do you know where a lady named Helene lives? Can you show me? My mommy told me not to talk to strangers. Your mommy, huh? She's right. My name is Nicole, and I'm five. Nicole, c'est trs joli. My name is Lyon. Now you're not a stranger anymore. I'm not a stranger when your mommy says I'm not a stranger. Just give me some time, okay? Just a few more days and I will have it. You will have it, I promise. Friday. Friday. Friday. Not a partial payment, cash. 450 bucks, cash. Absolutely. Okay. If you don't, you and your family are on the street. I don't think this would be a good time to ask my mommy. Deadbeats like you are why I can't get the goddamn elevator fixed. You live here? I came to visit. Well excuse me. Let's go. Mommy, is he a stranger? Nicole, go inside and draw with your crayons. Just for a minute, honey. So you finally decided to grace us with your presence. Helene, it was impossible for me to go. I put myself in lots of trouble to get here. Well, I've got news for you. It wasn't worth it, because you're too late. Helene, I tried. I'm sorry. I tried. You know, the only thing that he wanted was just to see your face again. Maybe we should go inside. No, I don't want you inside. I don't want you anywhere near me or my daughter again. You're the one who started her father on that shit. That's not true. Oh, yeah? He took that shipment to Amsterdam for you. That's what I say to the cop. He was a smart kid. I didn't want him to go in jail. He had a future. You were pregnant. Oh, spare me the details. You're family. He might have been better off if you had just kept your mouth shut and let him go to jail. He was not enough strong to be in jail. It would have killed him. The streets that you left him on are what killed him. No, Helene. Come on. I don't have anything more to say to you. Helene, come on. Helene, you and Nicole, we're family. You're my only family. Let me try to help you. Helene. This is to help you with your bill. I don't want your money. Don't you get it? I don't want anything from you ever again. Now, get out of here before I call the cops. You look like you're about ready to jump off a bridge. Here, have some chicken. No. Thanks. I need something else. You don't even have to say it, man. I'm psychic. Foreign Legion, huh? That's them guys with those white hats on, right? I thought the Foreign Legion was something that you see in old movies, or something. I wish it was just an old movie. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, where you want to go now, man? You want to get some girls, you want to go dancing? You know what I'm saying? Where you want to go? I've got some business to finish. Personal business. Is it something I can help you with, man? Yeah. Maybe. Hey, look here. Let's drink to that, man. Hey, put them up there. Here, all right. Jump the devil with his blind children. Look here, man, I gotta make phone call. I'll be right back, all right? Yeah? Yeah. Where you going? Hey, we got to find us a place to stay for the night, right? I'm looking out for you. I'll be right back. Hey, hey, there's a phone. Look out, look out. All right. All right. Just stand up. Hey. Check it out, Dorothy. We ain't in Kansas no more. Where are we going? Visit an old friend of mine. There. Yeah, that's the place, right there. Sure you all right? Yeah. Yeah. She only uses this place when she's in LA on business. Go, go, go ahead. Look around. It's yours for the night. How about you? Yeah, I'll be right next door. That's hers, too. Okay. It's nice to have friends, ain't it? Hey, go look. You relax, man. Enjoy yourself. Good morning. Joshua told me you needed a place to stay for the night. I hope this was adequate. Yes. Thank you. I need to go. Excuse me. So go. When I came in this morning, you were spread across the bed like an old throw rug. What happened to my clothes? I gave them to the valet with instructions to burn them. You told them to burn my clothes? Give me a break. There are a few shops right down the street. I'm sure we'll be able to find a way to replace your fabulous wardrobe. I just want my clothes back. Not on your life. I'm taking you shopping today if I have to drag you kicking and screaming. Why are you so nice to me? Just try one more. S'il vous plat. It's nice. It's not for me. No? How about this? Any better? Everything okay in there? Everything is fine. You know, people in New York are still talking about your fight. Let them talk. You planning on sleeping in the hallway? No. I'll stay next door with Joshua. Is that it? You two got something going? Cynthia, I'm not your toy. If you want a toy to play with, talk to Russell, not to me. You want to carry this? There. Come on. Is this your ball? Take some money. Oh, Christ. I'll do it. Well, finally. I mean, I'll fight. Oh. But first you have to help me to take care of some business. All right, talk to me. I need to open a bank account. I like that kind of talk. Not in my name, we'll make up a name. Don't ask me why, just do it. That's my condition. I'll call my accountant first thing in the morning. Anything else? Yes. I have to move out of here. Do I have the right to ask what brought these sudden changes on? Look, I'm gonna fight for you. I have to live like a fighter. This place is too nice to me, too soft, too easy. I see. Are you sure it isn't because you've found something a little softer, a little easier out on the street today? Don't answer that. That's "My business. My business!". I'm sick of this shit! Get out! Get the fuck out! And take that goddam cripple with you. In the morning you call Russell and you tell him where you're staying. From now on, you deal with Russell, and only with Russell. Our relationship is strictly business. The way it should have been from the beginning. You got that? And you owe me for these. I'll call Russell in the morning. You don't forget to call your accountant. I'll think about it. Yeah. Think about it. Don't fall in them damn skates, boy! Excuse me. No, no. Please, sir, go right ahead. What is this, a dance, man? He's got on a damn skirt. Scotland. Scotland? Scotland's shit. Kick his Scotland ass. It's not that bad. Go up his dress. I'd like to see if he got any drawers on. Take your time, take your time now. Don't be shaking hands with him. Come on, man, come on. Now... Damn. Look at all this. Get off my car. Move, move, move. Get off my car, man. Get off the damn car. Yeah, that's it, that's it, that's it. That's it. One more round, one more round. Almost there. That's it. Yeah, that's all right. That's it. Lay it on him, that's it. You got it, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let go of him, Lyon. He's gone. Let go of him. Hey, let him go, let him go, let him go. Let him go. He's gone. Let him go, Lyon, come on. Yeah, that's right. Be ready with the cash, Flash. Okay. All right. All right. Yeah. I'm back. Who's back? We're back in town. That's right, baby. After you, ladies. Moustafa, it's your turn. Mommy, does this mean I can have a bike? Honey, why don't you go in the other room so I can talk to Mr. Eldridge, okay? You could draw me a pretty picture. I'm gonna go draw myself a bike. Well, that would be very nice, sweetie. Cute. I just don't know how I couldn't have known about it. Well, husbands do this all the time. Yeah. Secret little insurance policy, want to make sure the wife and kids will be taken care of, you know? Without freaking them out. You know what I mean? Well, you'll get one of those every month. You know how the post office is around here, so I'll be bringing them by myself, if you don't mind. Oh, no, that's fine. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Eldridge. Don't thank me. Thank the man who set up the policy. May he rest in peace. Oh, just do me one little favor. I know it's something that he would have wanted. Well, what is that? Get the little girl a bike. All right, you have a nice day now. Yes! That's it, that's it. I like that. Yeah. Hey, hey. That's bad for you. Destroys your concentration. Well, it looked good to me. It looked good to me, but get on out there, boy. Hey, you guys. What are you doing? What is that? Like my new bike? Yeah. Bye, you guys. Bye. Bye. See you tomorrow. Moustafa, wake up. He's here, downstairs! Come on, let's go. Nicole! Come on inside, honey. Think he see us? He'll be back. All right. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay, I'm taking some bets. Lyonheart five to fight in the pool. No wading. Yeah! Get up! That's it. Better luck next time, man. We don't need to go Rambo, huh? That's it. Yeah! Hey. We did it. My boy did it. Who is Helene Gaultier? According to the bank, she's the one they said cashed that phony insurance check. She used to be married to his brother. He's just trying to help the woman out, that's all. Is he fucking her? Cynthia, you're one hard, cold, sick bitch, you know that? I asked you a question. Bitch, the man don't even step inside her apartment. She don't know where the damn money's coming from. Well, as his self-appointed manager, I'm counting on you to keep him out of trouble. You mean keep him making money. That's right. For me. And for you. Start keeping an eye on those two. Hi. See my new bike? I said that's a nice bike. Is that French? My daddy used to talk French. I've got to go now. Who's that? Nicole. Okay, you go home right now. You go home right now. You know why we're here. Don't force us to get rough in front of little girl. Without me they'll be on the street. Tell your sad stories to the court-martial. We're just supposed to take you back, any way we can. Just give me one week to get the money for them. One week. Your time was up in the desert, and we still owe you for that one, fucker. Go to hell. I show you hell. Grab him! Come on. This is the end. Let's go. Let's go! Lion. If you're in some kind of trouble, maybe we ought to know about it. And you spying on me, I should know about it, too. Okay, now you know. Maybe we should lay all our cards on the table. Do you hear that? Either you take a ride with the cops or you take a ride with me. Now what's it gonna be stud? What about them? If I was you I wouldn't be so concerned about their health It doesn't look like they were doing you any big favours today. Come on. Here. Oh, man! These dudes did a number on you, huh, homes?

Now is he in here? Can you tell me if he's in here? Well who knows? Who knows where he... ...Excuse me, I have to go. I rushed over here as soon as I heard what happened. My God. You're staying here tonight, aren't you? When did you start to care? Get off it Lyon. I know I said some things that I probably shouldn't have But if I had known the truth about your situation Why didn't you tell me? I could have helped you with your family. - You want to help? - Yeah. I need your help. Whatever you want. Who's there? Mr. Eldridge. I wasn't expecting you back so soon. Yeah, I know. Look, something's come up. We've got to talk. About what? Look, I heard about the shit that went down today. Look... Please, Mrs. Gaultier, this is real important. Look, you've got to get out of this place tonight. You and the little girl. How do you know what happened today? Hey, my man? So there never was an insurance plan, was there? Okay. Now you see that? Yeah, that's where your money's been coming from. No, no, no, no. Look, now I think you owe him a minute of your time to say what he's got to say. So, say what you got to say. Okay. Those men today, they followed me from North Africa. They knew I'd be coming to see you. Does this have anything to do with drugs? Because if it does, I don't want to have anything to do with it. I've been through this shit with Francois... Helene, I swear, it's not drugs. Now I don't have too much time, but I'm here to help you. Don't do this to me. My life is hard enough as it is, I... I'm not trying to give you problems. I'm here to help you. Please, you've got to trust me. Hi, Mr. Eldridge. Hey. Yeah, yeah. See my new bike? He's already seen it. Mommy, is he still a stranger? No, honey. This is your uncle Lyon, your daddy's brother. I knew you weren't really a stranger. That's him. Atilla. A born killer. Real pro, not some bum we picked off the street. He likes to toy with his opponents, give them hope. Then he tears them apart. Never seen anything like that on our circuit, huh? And that's why I can't let you have Lyon just yet. The fight's already scheduled. But if I get hassled by the French Consulate or the immigration people, it'll screw up everything. So I need your cooperation. And I promise you, as soon as Atilla's finished ripping him apart, I will hand him over to you as is. What do you say, guys? I say... Can we watch? Yes. I hope this is the right stuff. Joshua picked them. Well, there's enough to feed her entire kindergarten class. And there's something else Santa Claus brought. Oh, no. Merry Christmas. You guys are gonna spoil her. It's my only niece, I've got the right to spoil her, right? Yeah, I guess so. Well, if there is no real food here, I guess I'll pick some things up from work tomorrow, bring them home. That's something else I want to talk about. I don't think you should go back to that place anymore. Are you serious? How long do you expect us to stay here? I don't know, just until you have a new job or another husband. I mean, it's no problem, you can stay here. It's home now. This is beautiful. Yeah, your niece, she made it for you. And insisted I put it right where you'd see it. Nice. Oui. Hey, man, guess who's outside? Let's get crazy. Where are we going? Loosen up, we're going to see some friends. How are your relatives doing, by the way? They'll be much better if I was there. Well, this little party we're attending tonight, it's for their benefit as much as ours. These friends of mine are thinking of betting some serious money on your next fight, Lyon. Just how serious depends on you. We can all retire on this one. Don't fuck it up. Mr. Lyonheart, welcome. We've just been watching your videotape. Most impressive. Would you like a drink? Can I get you a drink, sir? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll have a gin and tonic with a twist of lime, my good man. By all means. Come this way, please. Did you have a pleasant journey over here? No, man. I'm sorry to hear that. So, did you get the tape? If you knew what I went through to smuggle this out... What do you think? Not too good. Full of shit. Enough of this. Well, I have to tell you, I'm not too impressed. What about you, Mr. Lyonheart? We have friends in Hong Kong who say that he will wipe the floor with you. What do you think about that? Anything is possible. Humble devil isn't he? Talk is cheap. You've all seen him in action. Draw your own conclusions, gentlemen. As far as I'm concerned, Lyonheart is gonna eat this bozo for breakfast. And I've got a quarter mil ready to back it up. We'll let you know which way we're going on the day of the fight. Faster? Yeah, faster. Okay. Okay, that's it for today, guys. She's so beautiful. Tonight, I'll have a fight, a big fight, lots of money, and if I win, I would like to take you and Nicole away from this place, away from this city, and leave all the bad stuff behind us. No problems. No problems, it'll be clear. This is going great. Picked up your highest script. You understand what I'm saying? You don't understand at all, right? Okay. Madhouse out there, man. Hey, hey, hey! My man. Hey, look at you. Yeah. Ready to get rich? Come on, throw a few, throw a few. I took all my money out of the bank and I put a bet on myself. We're going to win that fight. Confidence, that's what I like to hear, man. You know what I'm saying? All right, all right, what is it, man? You've been hiding something all week long. What's going down, man? Nothing. Nothing, huh? Nothing? Easy. You know what's circulating out there, man? 12 million motherfucking dollars, man. Cynthia's friends have come through like a motherfucker, man, and then I hear that shit about Atilla. Man, this dude's already bagged eight bodies. I'll beat him. Beat him? You ain't gonna beat him, not if you're all fucked up. How're you gonna beat him if you're all fucked up? I'll beat the guy. I have to. You don't have to do shit, motherfucker, but get yourself all fucked up like I did. Is that what you want? Be out there on the street, motherfucker, running $5 fights for winos and junkies? I'm gonna take you away from this shitty business. You and my family, even Cynthia, if she wants to. Cynthia, man? You think Cynthia gives a flying fuck about you? You know what your problem is, man? You got a big heart, Lyonheart. I mean, you're strong as a lion, man, but this right here, this? This is what fucks you up and leaves you bleeding on the motherfucking ground with nobody to give a two-bit shit about your ass. Look, Lyonheart, nobody gives a shit about you but you, man. Nobody. You care about me. I'm gonna win that fight. You've got to trust me. Hey, Josh. What it is. Who you betting on? Look at the board. I'd say the wind's definitely blowing in our direction. I didn't ask you that. I asked you who you were betting on. Why? Having any last-minutes doubts about your boy? No, I... I was just remembering the way you did me. Is there something I should know about Atilla? Is there something I should know about Lyon? No, no, no, no. No. He's gonna stomp that dude in the ground. Send him home in a little box. Well then, there's the desk. You've got about five minutes left to place your bet. You near an hour too late, man. Hookie-bookie, what's up, man? Hey, talk to me, man. You gonna make a bet, or what? All of the stuff. Yeah? Very good. Which way are you going, man, Lyonheart or Atilla? One minute till post, my friend. Did you see the look on his face? He's totally psyched out. He's toying with him. That's right. That's it. All right. Got him. Another one. Keep going. Yeah. Kick him again. There we go. Yeah! What's wrong? Man. Lyonheart, stay down, damn it. Stay the fuck down! Stay down, man. Just stay down. We bet all the money. Don't worry about that, just stay down. Cynthia, she bet against me. I know it. You were right, you were right. She bet against me. Damn it! This dude's gonna kill your ass. Don't you know that? This dude's gonna kill your ass, man. Don't you know that? Look, he's hurt. Come on, Lyonheart. Come on. That dude's gonna kill your ass. Don't you know that? Lyonheart, I told you the way this shit did me. Don't let it do you, man. Stay the fuck down. Come on, man. Come on, Lyon. We don't need the money, man. I got us a deal. I told you, 50-50 all the way down the line. Well, I'm gonna split it with you, man. 50-50, all the way, man. Just like I said I would. Look, it's on him, man. The whole bet's on Atilla. Wrong bet. Yes! This dude's gonna kill your ass, man. Come on, kick the snot out of him! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, Lyonheart. Hey. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, Lyonheart. Lyonheart! Yeah! Come on! Come on! You... Come on! Come on! All right! Get out there. You bury that motherfucker. Kick the shit out of him! We got him! We got him! Finish him, man. Right. Great fight, Lyon. Your family's going to be okay now. It's time to go home. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, Cynthia, darling, I just wanted to thank you for such wonderful advice. Open the door. You definitely got heart, Lyonheart. Don't ever lose it, because you never get it back. Take it from me. I've been there, man. Miss Caldera, the house would like to have a word with you regarding your unsecured marker. This way, please. If you find that bitch, don't let her off the premises. She's headed toward the front door now, sir. With the cash? Tell him it's in New York. I swear it is. I'll have it tomorrow. You better. Oh, my God. Look. We're all ready to go. What happened? Come on. I love you. Nicole, you and your mommy will have to go without me, okay? Here, this will help you. No. Why? You have to go with us. You have to. It's not fair! Why can't you go? It's not fair! It's not fair! I know, life is not too fair. And sometimes it's ugly and it's stupid and mean. But sometimes, life is beautiful, too. Now I've got to go back to an ugly place, and if I don't, I'll be running for the rest of my life, and you and your mommy will be running with me. I don't care. Nicole, chrie, you've seen too much ugly already. What about you? I'll always have something beautiful to remember. You take care of them, okay? You got it, man. You got it. I love you. Me, too. I'll miss you. Come on, let's go. I love you. Get out. Good luck. Lyon! Lyon! Hey, man. What the hell? Hey, man. Hey, why... English - US
