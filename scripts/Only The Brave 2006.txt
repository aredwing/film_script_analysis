Zero Japanese attacked our P-40 at the airport by up to 7 fleet. We were an easy target. Senzaki Steve and I spent the whole night carrying dead and wounded. On Monday, the FBI came after my father. He stood in the doorway, Best dressed in a suit. I was still in uniform ... covered with blood my colleagues in the Navy. He shook me and said ... "Never forget I was born here. " Then he went away My father came to Hawaii in 1905 and established a Buddhist temple Hongonji. When I was little ... I saw him in a room of meditation, sometimes sitting for several hours. I asked: "What are you doing here?" He replied: "I look at another world." "What a world, Dad?" I replied: "Do not worry, Jimmy, someday you'll know. " I thought that this day has come when the army ... after Pearl Harbor gave us a chance ... a chance to defend our homes and country. I thought it was the day where we have landed in Africa where it first stood against the Third Reich. I thought it was the day where we have landed in Italy and began to roll battle for battle. Only I do not know ... it is that I have not tried find another world ... Another world was gone. Wahiawa, HAWAII, 1953 Jimmy? Is this you? Jimmy? You came early. How was work today? Jimmy ...

The arms and legs hanging on pieces of skin and muscle. They looked at me knowing that death is coming ... and everyone was looking for, they thought or wanted to be with them ... were their relatives. This fear, look for unforgettable moments of life ... beautiful moments, The last chance to see life. Do not you tired of reading this over and over again? No. How's the arm?

But it sounds good, right? Yes. Another world. My dad told me that this is not something you can see. It is pure, innocent, everything is good. It is in us, ready to leave us. Do not be afraid to look into the darkness ... to take the next step. Purely. About 4 or 5 km. Guess the name of the ship, who will take us to the mainland. -What? -S.S. Maui. Do not talk. At least one of the gods protect you. Jimmy, I am mestizo. Do you think that would be fine if I go too? What are you talking about? My father grew up with your father.

Again, the landing was 900m east of the landing zone, over. Command wants to talk to the team leader. Reception. I refuse. The commander is dead I am now in command. Reception. I understood, radio silence until 6:00. Reception. I understood. The end of the reception. I think they failed. Send a group inquiry, Lieutenant? We can not afford to lose more people. I give only a proposal sir. Lieutenant ... These boys would be raised to the Lord as well as to Captain Ford. Now you are in command. Thanks, Sergeant. We need to conserve ammunition. Forward rest. Command. Germany cut off Battalion Texas 41st We got orders to pull them. Put a medical battalion in the church in the northern part of town. This is the closest point where to get going. Is damaged, but big. -What about the opponent? -There is not an official said. Texas 141 is nailed on the hill. We know only that Germany surrounded them. What do you suggest? Germany are scattered in the area several kilometers. Maybe one or two regiments. How long 1 41 Battalion, is there? Will be withdrawn. Now our turn. As head, Jimmy? Why do not you wake me? I said that I did not. The second battalion went two hours ago. A third battalion will begin at 4:00 and the first set off to 5.00 The whole regiment? I thought Colonel gave us two days of rest. -General changed his mind. -To hear last night. What happened, Jimmy? They tried to make the discharges. I heard the aircraft when the fog rose. Dump failed. It does not give us much time. Doc says he needs rest. I agree. All right. Jimmy, you're here great sergeants Let them be your eyes. All right. A command post set here some 500m away. Each company will have an artillery observer ... but do not expect the support of artillery. See you at the assembly point for 30 minutes. Sorry, Jimmy. But I can see better. Sergeant, this is not the same regiment with which we trained? No, I think that these are the guests ... who wanted to fight with us in the city. Yeah, how is this city called? Hati, or something like that. Idiot. This was the second division, and the town was called Sparta. How should I know? All white people look the same. Texas 141 has problems. These include the U.S. Army and they need our help. You have 28 minutes. Hey, Jimmy, this letter came when I slept. You see this sign? SERVE NO COLOUR Only white As for you, Tojo. It Takata. What? Mistake. Not Tojo. Only Takata. I do not think you heard what I said. We can make them. Let's go. But, Sergeant ... -Zaki, come on. You were lucky. Lucky, just as we ... to fight for freedom fight their own battles. Some are worth stoczenia others do not. Do not worry so. Yes, keep food warm. - "Aloha Oe." -What? -Until we meet again. One third of our regiment came from an internment camp ... Where they were detained wszyscty the Japanese from the west coast Yuk told me that they lost houses, jobs ... everything they had. The rest of us came from the islands. No matter where you came from Hawaii and Mississippi ... we are all for the same reason ... and together we return home or we die together. Hello darling. Your grandfather is looking for you. Come on, I'll take you to him. Thank you. Goodbye. How are you, Reverend? Well, Jimmy. And do you like? Can I ask you something? Sure. When someone dies ... How many days needed soul to get to heaven? What kind of Buddhist? Just as I thought. Thank you, Reverend. Noszowi brought the dead and wounded from the first line ... occupy all the beds and stretchers. Our tanks and trucks could not reach the scene. Our artillery could not help us. We learned that Command was right. Two full regiments, more than They had more than twice advantage over us. Hitler wanted to make Teksanczykw example. Too much approached the FATHERLANDU. You were with us a very long, Takata? Time flies. The command of the company. They think that you ... Well, I think that all the Japanese can poison everything. If you are not exempt. Sorry, Jimmy. Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! -Do you think you will repeat the strike? -I do not know. Give it a rest guys? Not half will go to sleep. Make sure that everyone got something to drink and eat.

Well, sir, just a thought ... You came to the front lines The fast track to take command. When I was in North Africa Was assigned the Medical Battalions. It's been so long? Every day, reported How many died in battle. I looked at the body to give face name. In Italy, I could not do this anymore.
