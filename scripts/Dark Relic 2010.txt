I HAVE TO...GET RID OF IT. - I'VE MET TOO MANY CHARLATANS SINCE OUR ARRIVAL HERE, AND MANY KNIGHTS HAVE BEEN TRICKED INTO TAKING FALSE RELICS TO THE HOLY SEE. I WON'T BE ONE OF THEM. STAY HERE, SIR RAYMOND. STAND GUARD. - YES, SIR. - IT'S IN THERE. - IF THIS IS A GENUINE PIECE OF THE CROSS, THEN IT IS NO FOR US TO TOUCH. - COULD IT BE? - VENI, VENI SANCTE SPIRITUS... [speaking Latin] ...AMEN. THE BLOOD OF CHRIST! - WE HAVE A DEAL. - GOOD. TAKE IT AWAY. QUICK. - BLESS YOU, MY SON. - WELL, IS IT? - IT IS A TRUE RELIC. A REAL PIECE OF THE LORD'S CROSS. - YOU COULD FEEL THE HOLY SPIRIT POURING FROM IT. - WE HAVE FINALLY SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS CRUSADE WORTH THE FIGHT. LET'S GO. [coins clanging] [Gothic-style music]  [horse neighing] - WORD HAS SPREAD ABOU OUR FIND, SIR GREGORY. - AND THEY SAY A PIECE OF THE CRUCIFIX IS AS PRECIOUS AS THE HOLY GRAIL. - I SAW SOME RED FACES IN TANCRED'S COUR WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS. HE FEELS HE WAS BEATEN TO THE ULTIMATE PRIZE. - WELL, AS WELL HE MIGHT. WHEN WE BRING THIS BEFORE THE HOLY SEE, THERE'LL BE PRAISE INDEED. YOU'LL BE A HERO. - A HERO? I'M MORE CONCERNED A HOW THESE NIGHTS GROW COLDER. - THE WEATHER IS TURNING. PERHAPS NOW IS THE BEST TIME FOR US TO LEAVE. - WHEN WAS THE BES TIME TO ARRIVE? - THE CRUSADE WAS WORTH ALL THE SACRIFICE. DON'T YOU THINK, BROTHER GEORGE? - OF COURSE. - THINK OF ALL THE GLORY YOU'D HAVE MISSED HAD WE ARRIVED ANY LATER. - WHAT GLORY WAS THERE IN THIS BLOODSHED? - PERHAPS YOU FORGE IT WAS THE GLORY OF GOD. - GOD HAD NO WISH FOR THIS. THIS WAS THE GREED OF MAN. - BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY, MY LORD. THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS BLASPHEMY. - YOU WERE AT THE COUNCIL OF CLERMONT, AS WAS I. EMPEROR KOMNENOS ASKED FOR OUR HELP, AND WE WERE READY TO GIVE IT. - CLERMONT WAS A COUNCIL OF WARMONGERS. I SEE THAT NOW. - YOU NEEDN'T SPILL TEARS OVER THOSE WHO HAVE SLAIN. THEY DESERVE WHAT THEY GOT. AND NOW WE HAVE THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. AS IT SHOULD BE. - WHAT WOULD YOU SPILL TEARS OVER? - I SPILL THEM OVER SLEEPING ALONE. - FOR ME, IT'S SPENDING ANOTHER NIGHT IN THIS COLD CAMP WHILE MY LANDS ARE PROBABLY BEING PLUNDERED BY THE THIEVING BASTARDS I LEFT TO LOOK AFTER THEM. WHEN CAN THE REST OF US SEE THIS TREASURE? - AN ARTIFAC OF THIS MAGNITUDE SHOULD ONLY BE FOR THE EYES OF THE HOLY FATHER HIMSELF. HE SHALL DECIDE WHO IS FIT TO GAZE UPON IT. I'VE DECIDED IT'S TIME. TOMORROW, WE LEAVE FOR JAFFA. FROM THERE, WE TAKE A SHIP TO ROME. WE PRESENT OUR GIFT, AND THEN... FINALLY...WE GO HOME. - YES! THAT'S A SIGN FOR MORE MEAD, LADS. [birds chirping] - THIS FOR YOUR THANKS, CAPTAIN. - I THINK WE'LL HAVE A SMOOTH PASSAGE FOR YOU, MY LORD. OH, OOPS. [chuckles] YOUR BACKSIDE'S TOO USED TO FINE WINES AND LAZY HORSES, EH? - AND MY BLADE IS USED TO INSOLENT TONGUES. - OH, I'M SURE IT IS. AND ME, BEING A GOD-FEARING MAN, WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY. FATHER. - IT'S BROTHER. - CAREFUL THERE. - YES, MY LORD. [loud thud] - WHAT HAVE WE HERE? - I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN. I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT FOR YOUR EYES. - MAYBE NOW YOU'D ALLOW ME TO BRING YOU A CLEAN TUNIC. YOU SMELL WORSE THAN THE CAPTAIN. [both chuckle] - YOU KNOW MY VOW. NOT UNTIL I REACH MY OWN BED. - AT LEAST NOW I CAN FINALLY SEE THAT HAPPENING. I CAN'T WAI TO GET BACK HOME. - ME TOO. AND THEN WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT YOUR STATUS AS SQUIRE. I'M SURE YOUR FATHER WOULD BE PROUD TO KNOW HOW BRAVELY YOU FOUGHT ALONGSIDE ME. YOU FOUGHT AS A KNIGHT. I WONDER WHA THE GIRLS BACK HOME WOULD SAY ABOUT SIR PAUL. - THE GOSPEL IS TAKEN FROM MARK, CHAPTER FOUR, BEGINNING WITH THE 39TH VERSE. ET EXSURGENS COMMINATUS EST VENTO ET DIXI MARI TACE OBMUTESCE... - DID YOU SEE IT? THE RELIC. - NO, I WAS OUTSIDE. - WHY SUCH SECRECY? - WE'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE ITS SANCTITY. - PRESERVE? PRESERVE IT FROM WHO? AREN'T WE HONORABLE KNIGHTS? - WE'LL SEE IT SOON ENOUGH. - ...QUIA ET VENTUS ET MARE OBOEDIUNT EI. IN NOMINE PATRI, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. AMEN. [grunts, swords clashing] - [growling] [loud growl] [ship creaking] - CAPTAIN! THE WATER IS RUINED TOO! - WHAT IN GOD'S NAME? - WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S GOING ON? - HERE. TASTE. - OH, IT'S SALT WATER. - ALL OF IT IS. BUT THE WATER WAS FRESH LAST NIGHT. - A WAVE MUST'VE WASHED OVER AND SPOILED IT. - IMPOSSIBLE! EVEN THE BARRELS THA WEREN'T OPEN ARE RUINED! AND THIS? - BUT WE ATE WELL LAST NIGHT. - IT'S ALL INFESTED. WE HAVE NOTHING. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. MY MEN ARE TALKING-- WHISPERING EVIL THINGS. THEY TALK OF A CURSE-- AN EVIL YOU HAVE BROUGHT UPON US. - AR--I UNDERSTAND YOUR CREW'S CONCERN, AND OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS BEEN SOME MISFORTUNE HERE. BUT NOT A CURSE. WE ARE CRUSADERS. WE FOUGH WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE. - [scoffs] THEN WHY IS GOD PUNISHING US? MAYBE YOUR PRECIOUS WAR WAS LESS THAN HOLY. - CAPTAIN! STARBOARD! [thunder clapping] - HEY, HEY, HARD TO PORT! WE HAVE TO RIDE OU THIS SQUALL. STOW THE SAILS! THEY'LL BE RIPPED TO PIECES! - WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP? - YOU CAN HELP BY KEEPING OUT OF OUR WAY. GET BELOW DECKS AND TIE EVERYTHING DOWN, INCLUDING YOURSELVES. AND YOU CAN PRAY FOR OUR LIVES! [thunder clapping] [screaming] [thunder clapping, all yelling] [ripping] - [screams] - AHH! - [pained scream] - AH! [thunder clapping] - THANK GOD. WHERE'S THE CREW? - SWEPT OVERBOARD. - [sighs] - THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE SURVIVED. - IT WAS THE WILL OF GOD. - OH, I MUST'VE BLACKED OUT. I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ELSE. - NEVER SEEN A STORM LIKE THIS BEFORE. - IT RAGED FOR TWO HOURS OR MORE, AND THEN SILENCE. - AND THEN THIS DAMNED FOG. - NOT ONLY ARE WE NOW OFF COURSE, WE HAVE NO MEANS TO FIND A PORT. - THAT TEMPEST COULD'VE BLOWN US ANYWHERE IN CHRISTENDOM. - LAND! [crashing noises] [grunts] [birds chirping] [wind blowing] - WHERE'S THE SHIP? - WELL, LET'S NOT STAND AROUND HERE. WE'LL CATCH OUR DEATH FROM THE COLD. THERE MIGHT BE WARMTH AND FOOD FURTHER ON. - I THINK WE SHOULD STOP AND PRAY FOR GUIDANCE. - OR WE COULD CONTINUE WALKING AND FIND SOME. - I WONDER WHY THE CRUSADE HAS STRENGTHENED THE FAITH OF EVERYBODY EXCEPT YOU. - WELL, MAYBE I WAS THE ONLY ONE FIGHTING WITH MY EYES OPEN. [distant screams, swords clanging] SHH, SHH, SHH. LISTEN, WHAT'S THAT? STAY. GUARD THE RELIQUARY. COME ON. - IF YOU INSIST. [grunts, swords clanging] - BLITHERING BARBARIANS! - ROBERT! NO, NO! - AH! [horse whinnies] AH! AH. [grunts] - AH! AH. - BANDITS. [grunts, swords clanging] - AH! - THE TURKS ARE ON OUR SIDE. - AH--UGH. [soft cough] - YOU FIGHT LIKE A KING. - YOU KNEEL WHEN YOU SPEAK TO A KNIGHT, DOG. - SIR ROBERT! CRUSADES ARE OVER. SURELY THAT MEANS THA WE CAN ALL BE FRIENDS NOW. - MY THOUGHTS TOO. WE HAVE BEEN HUNTING THESE...BANDITS EVER SINCE THEY PILLAGED SEVERAL MOSQUES. WHEN THEY ATTACKED THESE PILGRIMS, WE COULD NOT STAND ASIDE IDLY AS AN INJUSTICE WAS COMMITTED. - YOU LIE. - IT IS TRUE, MY LORD. THE TURKS FOUGHT TO SAVE US. WE ARE THE ONLY TWO WHO SURVIVED. - THE TURK'S NAME IS HASAN. MY WIFE, SAFA. OUR FRIEND, ALEM. - YOU WILL BE REWARDED FOR YOUR-- - WE DID NOT DO I FOR A REWARD. AND AS I SEE IT, YOU SAVED MY LIFE. TWICE. THE FIRST IS MY REWARD. AND THE SECOND...A DEB OF HONOR THAT I OWE YOU. WE WILL TRAVEL THESE LANDS WITH YOU UNTIL I CAN REPAY SUCH A DEBT. - YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY WAN THESE SAVAGES TO TRAVEL WITH US. - FIND BROTHER GEORGE. TELL HIM TO TEND TO THE WOUND. THESE PILGRIMS WILL TRAVEL WITH US UNTIL THEY FIND SAFETY. SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH. [horse nickers] - PERHAPS YOU ARE A MAN OF PEACE AS WELL AS A MAN OF WAR. - AH, SIR ROBERT... I TAKE IT YOU NO LONGER DISAPPROVE NOW WE HAVE HORSES? [horse whinnies] - WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME IF I DID? - [chuckles] OF COURSE NOT. - WHAT TREASURE DO YOU CARRY? - IT IS A GIF FOR THE HOLY FATHER. - A TROPHY FROM THE CRUSADES? ANIMALS SENSE THINGS WE CANNOT. REAL POWER FROM PERCEIVED POWER. REAL VICTORY FROM PERCEIVED VICTORY. I FEAR THIS CRUSADE WILL NOT BE THE LAST. - AFTER WHAT I'VE WITNESSED, I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG. - I WONDER WHY YOU ARE SO KEEN TO RETURN HOME. DID YOU NOT FIND THE GLORY YOU SOUGHT? - THERE WAS NO GLORY. - FIGHTING FOR GOD IS GLORY ENOUGH. - I USED TO THINK SO. - AND NOW? - MAN BEGETS THE EVILS OF THIS WORLD. NOT GOD. - AND IS YOUR LOSS OF FAITH THE REASON YOU DRESS LIKE A FILTHY PIG? - [chuckles] I ONCE LED 100 MEN-AT-ARMS. WHAT YOU SEE HERE... IS ALL THAT'S LEFT. TO WASH MY HANDS OF THAT BLOOD... WOULD BE LIKE PONTIUS PILATE WASHING HIS HANDS. I'M NOT YET READY FOR MY ABSOLUTION. - ALL OF THIS IS THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE... [twig cracks] [sniffs] YOUR SHIP BEACHED HERE. FROM HERE, WE SHOULD GO INTO CONSTANTINOPLE, AND FROM THERE, YOU CAN CARRY ON TO ROME. - THAT IS A LONG WAY AROUND. WHY NOT GO WEST? - BECAUSE THAT WAY, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CROSS THE SEA TWICE. AND... AFTER YOUR RECENT EXPERIENCE, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WOULD PREFER TO STAY DRY. - SO WE FOLLOW YOU BLINDLY? - YOU CAN TAKE YOUR OWN BLIND PATH IF YOU PREFER. - CAREFUL HOW YOU SPEAK TO ME. - WHY SHOULD SHE WATCH HER MOUTH AROUND SUCH AN UNGALLANT KNIGHT? - A KNIGHT WHO HAS A SERF LIKE YOU UNDER HIS PROTECTION. YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR THAT. - [sighs] I CAN LOOK AFTER MYSELF. - YOU HAVE COURAGE. IT IS A FINE QUALITY TO HAVE. - SOMETHING I INHERITED FROM MY FATHER. HE WAS A BLACKSMITH. HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO SURVIVE IN AN UNJUST WORLD. - THE WORLD IS NOT UNJUST, MY CHILD. GOD IS EVERYWHERE. - I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD. - THAT IS BLASPHEMY. - IF THERE IS A GOD, WHY DID HE KILL MY FATHER... AND HAVE ME INDENTURED TO A SPOILED LORD WHO DRAGGED ME HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD ON A PILGRIMAGE I HAVE NO BELIEF IN? WHERE'S THE SENSE IN THAT? - THERE ARE PUNISHMENTS FOR WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID. - YOUR GOD PUNISHES THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE? ALLAH SUBHAN-ALLAH IS MORE MERCIFUL THAN THAT. - DON'T GET ME STARTED ON YOU, HEATHEN! - THERE ARE NO ARGUMENTS IN THIS CAMP. WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE. I THINK NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR US TO SLEEP. MY KNIGHTS WILL KEEP WATCH. [owl hooting] [horse nickering] - I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL WE COULD SPARE. BUT IT'S NICE AND WARM. AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T PU YOU TO SLEEP LIKE THE LAST TIME. - THANK YOU. COLD'S BITING WORSE THAN EVER TONIGHT. [menacing whispers] [metal clanging] [thunder clapping] - [menacing growls] - NO SIGN? - NO. - THE RELIC WAS SAFE. - WHY WOULD THIEVES NOT TAKE IT? - WE TRACKED THE KNIGHT'S FOOTSTEPS. THEY JUST VANISH. - MUST'VE BEEN AN AMBUSH. - YOU MISHEARD ME, I SAID THEY VANISH. HE DID NO TAKE ANOTHER STEP. THIS IS NO THE WORK OF...NORMAL MEN. - THE HASHSHASHIN WALK THESE LANDS. THEY ARE MURDERERS AND THIEVES. - EVEN THE HASHSHASHIN LEAVE A TRACE. - THEN IT IS THE DEVIL'S WORK. - THERE IS NO MORE WE CAN DO. WE MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE AND MOVE ON. - YOU SHOULD PLACE A BRIDLE OVER THE FRIAR'S MOUTH. HE'S SCARING THE OTHERS WITH ALL THIS TALK OF THE DEVIL. - IS HE SCARING YOU? - IF GOD DOESN'T EXIST, THEN NEITHER DOES THE DEVIL. I'M ONLY AFRAID OF THE EVIL IN MEN'S HEARTS. NOT IN THEIR MINDS. YOU KNOW I DON'T BELIEVE. AND I DON'T THINK YOU DO EITHER, MY LORD. - OH, NOW YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? - IT WAS A COMPLIMENT. YOU'RE NOT LIKE THE OTHERS. - CUT THEM DOWN. CUT THEM DOWN. - THIS IS EVIL, I TELL YOU. - NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR SCAREMONGERING! - THE FOOD ON THE BOAT, THE STORM, THE BANDITS, AND NOW THIS--IT'S THE DEVIL'S WORK, AND YOU KNOW IT. SATAN IS TRYING TO DESTROY THE CROSS! - KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO? BURY THEM BOTH. - [speaking Latin] [evil growl] - I AGREE WITH YOUR PRIEST. THIS PLACE IS...EVIL. - WE SHOULD LEAVE HERE. - WAIT, WAIT. NOBODY LEAVES UNTIL THE DEAD ARE BURIED. - [speaking Latin] - I AM A NATIVE TO THIS LAND. NO, NOT JUST A NATIVE. MORE THAN A NATIVE. I KNOW THIS LAND CORNER FROM CORNER. AND YET, IN ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE NEVER SEEN THINGS LIKE THIS BEFORE. MAYBE YOUR PRIES IS RIGHT. MAYBE THERE IS EVIL IN THIS PLACE. [crows cawing] - [groans] AH! - BROTHER GEORGE. [crows cawing] - WHAT'S HAPPENING? [crows cawing] - BLESS US NOW. [crows cawing] [horse whinnies] - [inhales sharply] - I HAVE MIXED THE HERB IN THE WATER TO NUMB THE PAIN. YOUR LEG DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. IT WILL NEED BINDING. - THE CROSS OF CHRIST? - [sighs] PART OF IT, YES. - NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY BAD LUCK FOLLOWS YOU. YOURS IS A PRIZE EVIL FINDS WORTHY OF DESTRUCTION. - ALL THE MORE REASON TO GET IT SAFELY TO ROME. SIR ROBERT, I WANT YOU TO GUARD THE RELIQUARY. MAKE SURE NO ONE TOUCHES IT. - [speaking Farsi] - THANK YOU. - SOMETHING PUZZLES ME. YOU'RE CARRYING A RELIC THAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE A PIECE OF CHRIST'S CROSS. AND YOU ACCEP THAT TO BE REAL? AS MUSLIMS? - THE KORAN SPEAKS OF JESUS AS A PROPHET. - YOU BELIEVE IN HIM TOO? - OF COURSE. ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME DEBATE AS TO WHETHER HE DIED ON THE CROSS. - I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU FIGHT FOR SIMILAR BELIEFS. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. - WE ARE NOT FIGHTING NOW. - AND YOU? YOU DON' BELIEVE IN ANYTHING. SO IS THE CASKET EMPTY? OR DOES IT JUS CONTAIN A PIECE OF WOOD? - MAYBE THERE WAS A MAN CALLED JESUS. I CAN BELIEVE THAT. BUT AS THE SON OF GOD? OR EVEN AS THE PROPHET OF GOD? NO. IT'S JUST A STORY. - THEN THA IS YOUR OWN BELIEF. I WONDER... WHO IS RIGHT? [wolf howling distantly] - [sharp inhale] MM. EH. [distant howling] - EVERYONE, GRAB A TORCH. [howling continues] ROBERT! - THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER. [howling, growls] - ROBERT! - EH, EH, EH. - OH! - HA! HA! [wolf whimpering] - HAY-YA! [growls] - AH! [growling] - [screaming] [wolf whimpers] [horses whinny] [howling distantly] - ARE THEY GONE? - I THINK SO. AND SO ARE THE HORSES. - ROBERT? ROBERT, CAN YOU HEAR ME? - [gasps] - AH. - WE NEED A HEALER. - SAFA! - AH! - LOOK! - AH, HE'S IN FEVER. I NEED COLD WATER AND PLANTS. ALEM, BRING BORAGE AND MOUNTAIN BALM. THERE MIGH BE MORE INSIDE. - IS YOUR PRIZE WORTH THIS SACRIFICE? - WE CAN'T ALLOW ANY DARK FORCES TO WIN. - I AGREE. OUR GODS MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT OUR ENEMY IS THE SAME. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? - WE NEED TO FIND SOME WISE COUNSEL. SOME HOLY GROUND. - THERE IS A-- A MONASTERY NORTH OF HERE. A DAY'S MARCH ON FOOT. IS--IS THAT SACRED ENOUGH? - [chuckles] - [chuckles] THANK YOU, HASAN. - [soft grunt] - HIS FEVER IS EASING. YOU HAVE A PRECIOUS SKILL. - CAN YOU SPEAK? - I, UH... - YOUR NAME WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START. - PAUL. - SQUIRE PAUL? - SOON TO BE A KNIGHT... WHEN WE RETURN HOME. - LIKE SIR GREGORY. - THE MEN ARE STARVING. AND MY STOMACH IS COMPLAINING TOO. - THERE'S PRECIOUS LITTLE TO HUNT DOWN HERE. IT WILL HAVE TO COMPLAIN A LITTLE LONGER. - LOOK, WE CANNO AFFORD TO BE WEAK... IF WE ARE ATTACKED AGAIN. - THAT KIND OF TALK CAUSES PANIC, ARTHUR. - OUR FORTUNE HAS CHANGED. A FARM. [inspirational music]  - GREETINGS. I AM SIR GREGORY. - YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM THE WAR, MY LORD. - WE ARE HEADING TO ROME. - THEN YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM ROME, MY LORD. - [chuckles] WE...WE HAVE TRAVELED FAR WITHOUT FOOD. WE ARE VERY HUNGRY. IF YOU HAVE ANY TO SPARE, WE WOULD BE MOST GRATEFUL. - FOR YOU. NOT FOR THEM. - THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS. HAVEN'T YOU HEARD? THE WAR IS OVER. AS A KNIGHT, I VOUCH FOR THEM. - SO DO I. - ALL RIGHT. COME IN. - YOU ARE MOST KIND. - GUARD THE RELIQUARY. - EXCELLENT. THIS STEW IS FIT FOR A KING. - WE'VE HAD A HARD ROAD SINCE WE WERE SHIPWRECKED HERE. THIS IS A HOSTILE LAND. - NO. SINCE MY WIFE DIED, MY DAUGHTER AND I HAVE NEVER HAD MUCH TROUBLE LIVING HERE. DURING THE WAR, CRUSADERS OCCASIONALLY PASSED THROUGH. BUT NOW THERE IS ONLY PILGRIMS. THIS LAND IS ENJOYING TIME OF PEACE. SOME MORE SOUP? - I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. - I SWEAR. WHEN HE WAS THROWN FROM THE CATAPULT, WE THOUGHT HIS BONES WOULD SNAP IN TWO. AND WHEN HE SURFACED FROM THE LAKE, HIS FACE WAS AS WHITE AS YOURS. [laughing] A YOUNG MAN SHOULD TALK TO A LADY. - SIR GREGORY TOLD ME I'M TO BE KNIGHTED WHEN WE RETURN. MAYBE YOU WOULD CARE TO SEE ENGLAND WHEN I'M KNIGHTED. THEN YOU CAN SEE MY LANCE. - [laughing] - WHAT? WHAT DID I SAY? [distant buzzing] - INSIDE. INSIDE, ALL OF YOU! QUICKLY, RUN! - WHAT IS IT? - SOMETHING'S COMING. SOMETHING'S COMING. - RUN! - INSIDE! - QUICKLY! - WHAT? - LOCUSTS! - YOU HAVE BROUGH A PLAGUE WITH YOU. - [groans] - QUICK! GO QUICK! GO, GO, NOW! - [screams] OH, OH! [groaning and grunting] [both grunting and screaming] [distant screams] [screaming] - IT'S CLEAR. - THERE CAN BE NO DOUB SATAN IS TRYING TO STOP YOU FROM DELIVERING YOUR PRIZE. - THEN WE BETTER REACH THE MONASTERY... BEFORE THE DEVIL REACHES US. SO STILL... YOU'RE NOT SWAYED BY RELIGION? - I THINK THA THE RELIC THAT YOU CARRY IS NOTHING BUT A CURSE, AND YOU SHOULD LE THE MONKS DEAL WITH IT. THE POPE HAS MORE THAN ENOUGH POWER AND WEALTH, SO WHY GIVE HIM MORE? - I SEEK FORGIVENESS. - I THOUGHT ALL CRUSADERS WERE GRANTED REMISSION OF THEIR SINS. - OH, I DON'T SEEK FORGIVENESS FROM GOD. I SEEK IT FROM MYSELF. - WHAT BRINGS KNIGHTS OF THE CRUSADE TO OUR HUMBLE MONASTERY? - WE NEED SHELTER. WE HAVE WOUNDED... AND SOMETHING EVIL IS STALKING US. - EVIL? A WOMAN. - SHE IS WITH ME. - THE TURKS CANNOT ENTER. - THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS. - THE TURKS WILL BE HAPPY TO SLEEP UNDER THE STARS. - LET ME BRING YOU TO SPEAK WITH OUR ABBOT. BUT YOUR WEAPONS MUST STAY HERE. WE DO NOT ALLOW THEM IN THE HOUSE OF GOD EITHER. - TAKE THE WOUNDED TO A PRIVATE CHAMBER. WHAT HAVE YOU BROUGHT? - A SACRED RELIC FROM THE HOLY LANDS. IT'S WHY WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOUR ABBOT. - WHERE AM I? - SIR ROBERT, YOU'RE AWAKE AT LAST. - WHAT HAPPENED? - YOU WERE BURNING WITH A FEVER, BUT YOU'RE SAFE IN A MONASTERY. - MY BROTHERS WOKE ME TO SAY YOU CARRY SOMETHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. - WE CARRY A GIF FOR THE HOLY FATHER. - WE HAVE SEEN MANY PILGRIMS AND KNIGHTS PASS BY. MANY EAGER TO MAKE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES BY BRINGING TRINKETS OF UNIMAGINABLE WORTHLESSNESS. - WE HAVE A PIECE OF THE TRUE CROSS. - SO I HAVE SEEN BEFORE. - TELL ME, FATHER, HAVE THESE TRAVELERS YOU SPEAK OF BEEN PURSUED BY MALICIOUS FORCES INTENT ON DESTROYING THEIR RELIC? SINCE WE LEFT THE HOLY LAND, WE'VE BEEN STRUCK BY TEMPESTS, SHIPWRECKED, MEMBERS OF OUR PARTY HAVE BEEN BUTCHERED IN THE FOREST. BIRDS HAVE BEEN STRUCK DEAD IN THE SKY. WE'VE BEEN ATTACKED BY WOLVES AND A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS AND ALL BECAUSE WE CARRY... THIS. - [scoffs] AND YOU BELIEVE THIS TO BE PART OF THE CRUCIFIX? - WE DO. - IT IS TRUE. BEHOLD! FROM THE CROSS OUR SAVIOR WAS CRUCIFIED UPON! AND IT WEEPS HIS BLOOD! "IESYS NAZARENYS REX IYDAEORYM. JESUS NAZARENE, KING OF THE JEWS." THIS TRULY IS PAR OF THE CRUCIFIX. THE INSCRIPTION WAS PLACED ABOVE CHRIST'S HEAD. PUT THERE TO MOCK HIM. THIS RELIC-- BUT THIS RELIC IS TAINTED BY THIS CURSED INSCRIPTION. DARK FORCES ARE NOT TRYING TO STOP YOU. THE RELIC IS ATTRACTING EVIL TO YOU, DRAWING IT LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME. - WELL, THEN-- THEN WE MUST DESTROY IT. - IT IS SACRILEGE TO DESTROY A SACRED RELIC. - WELL, IF IT IS THE LETTERS THAT ARE CURSED, WHY NOT TRY TO REMOVE THEM? - [grunts] - TRY THIS. - [grunts] [deep rumbling] [rumbling intensifies] [grunts] - THAT CANNOT BE. - CAN WE BURY I IN THE MONASTERY? [monks hissing and groaning] - COMING HERE HAS NO IMPROVED OUR SITUATION. [monks groaning] [screaming] - BEHIND YOU! - [growling] - THERE'S ONE BEHIND YOU ON THE TABLE! - [speaking native language] [monks groaning] - [grunts] - [screams] - [screams] - IT'S BOLTED FROM INSIDE... LIKE A FORT. [speaking native language] [speaking native language] [screams and grunts] [screams] - [screams] - [growls] - [grunts] - [screams] - [screams] - [distorted voice] YOU WILL ALL ROT IN HELL. [gasps] - YOU KILLED HIM. - THE MONKS WERE POSSESSED. THE RELIC IS DRAWING EVIL TOWARDS US. - THEN WE MUST DESTROY I BEFORE IT KILLS US ALL. - NO! - [grunts] IMPOSSIBLE. - [sighs] IT'S NOT EVEN WARM. - IT IS MADNESS TO DESTROY A RELIGIOUS ARTIFACT. - EVEN ONE SO EVIL? - YOU SAW THE BLOOD. THAT IS BLOOD OF OUR SAVIOR. BLOOD THAT MUST NO BE TAINTED. THERE ARE POWERS IN ROME THAT CAN DEAL WITH THIS. - WE WILL NEVER MAKE IT. - HE'S RIGHT. AND EVEN IF WE DID, THE EVIL IT DRAWS TO US WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING BEFORE WE EVEN REACHED ROME. - THEN LEAVE IT HERE. - FOR OTHERS TO FIND AND BE SLAUGHTERED? NO. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP OTHERS SAFE. THAT IS THE CODE WE SWORE ALLEGIANCE TO. THAT IS THE KNIGHT'S CODE. WHAT SAY YOU, SIR ROBERT? ROBERT, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - NEVER FELT BETTER. - WE CANNOT DESTROY IT. WE CANNOT LEAVE I AND WE CANNOT TAKE IT. YOU HAVE PUT US IN A PUZZLE THAT WE CANNOT SOLVE. - WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE THE DAMNED THING. - IF IT CAN WORK ITS EVIL HERE ON HOLY GROUND, WHERE CAN WE TAKE I THAT IT'S SAFE? - IT DIDN'T WORK IN JERUSALEM. AT LEAST NOT TO THIS EXTENT. - THE POWER OF THE HOLY LAND MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN THE EVIL. - WE MUST RETURN TO JERUSALEM. - HEAD BACK? - I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - FOR WHAT? - HOW MANY MORE TIMES WILL YOU SAVE MY LIFE? - AHH. HOW MANY MORE TIMES WILL I PUT YOUR LIFE IN DANGER? PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GO HOME. HASAN AND BROTHER GEORGE CAN ACCOMPANY YOU. THE EVIL WON' FOLLOW YOU THERE. - AND RETURN TO WHAT? I HAVE NO HOME. MY FATHER'S FORGE WAS TAKEN BECAUSE HE COULD NOT PAY HIS TAXES. IT WAS HIS LIFE. - PERHAPS IF WE RETURN TOGETHER, YOU COULD FIND A HOME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP LAST NIGHT. IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE LOSS FOR BOTH OF US. I CONSIDER YOUR DEB TO BE REPAID. - BAH. MERELY A TIMELY ENTRANCE. A FOOL COULD BREAK OPEN A DOOR. I'VE YET TO ACTUALLY SAVE YOUR LIFE. - YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL WIFE TO CONSIDER, MY FRIEND. I HAVE NONE. - NO...LADY WAITING AT HOME? - [chuckles] I WAS MARRIED ONCE IN MY YOUTH. - AND WHAT HAPPENED? - SHE DIED IN CHILDBIRTH ALONG WITH THE CHILD. - I THINK YOU SHOULD REST, MY FRIEND. - SPARE ME YOUR PITY. [spits] [grunting] - DON'T MOVE. DON'T EVEN BREATHE. - DO WE NOT HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS WITHOUT FIGHTING AMONGST OURSELVES? - THE FOOL'S AFFLICTED WITH MADNESS! - [laughs] HE OFFENDED ME. - AND HOW WOULD THAT BE, SIR ROBERT? - I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF HIM. AND AS FOR YOU... LAY A FINGER ON ME AGAIN AND YOU WILL BLEED, WHORE. AND YOU WILL NOT STOP ME. - I WILL NOT NEED TO. SHE CAN FIGHT HER OWN BATTLES. - WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU? - [screams] - HIS SKIN IS BURNING. - THE FEVER WAS CLEARING. WHAT WAS THAT? - A SPLINTER? - HE'S BEEN POISONED BY A SPLINTER FROM THE RELIC. IT'S WORKING INTO HIS BODY. - WHAT CAN WE DO? - IT'S BEYOND MY KNOWLEDGE TO CURE HIM. - [gasps] LET ME GO! - [grunts] - WE'LL HAVE TO BUILD A STRETCHER. - A FOULNESS AFFLICTS HIM. SOMETHING WICKED COMES NEAR. THE STORM, THE PLAGUE... IT'S GETTING WORSE. A DEMON STRENGTHENS AND DRAWS CLOSER. - DID HE HURT YOU? - NO. - NOW HAVE SAFA TAKE A LOOK AT THA AND THEN STAY CLOSE BY. - I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT. - SIR ROBERT'S CONDITION IS DETERIORATING. TO STOP NOW WOULD BE TO CONDEMN HIM TO DEATH. - THEN WE GO ON. - [speaking Latin] [speaking Latin] [explosions and startled reactions] - [speaking foreign language] [demon growls] - THE DEMON HAS FOUND US. I DON'T FEAR YOU, DEMON. I HAVE THE POWER OF GOD ON MY SIDE. CHRIST IS MY SAVIOR, AND IN HIS NAME I CAST YOU TO THE PI OF HELL WHERE YOU BELONG. BEELZEBUB, EATER OF THE DEAD, BE GONE BACK TO HELL! [demon roars] [grunts] UGH! - DIE BY MY BLADE. [demon roars] - IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, HIS SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT, I CONDEMN YOU. - [screams] - [gasps] - SAFA! - GET THEM OFF ME. HELP ME! [grunting and groaning] HELP ME! [screams] - [yelling in foreign language] [demon growls and roars] - THE DEMON HAS FOUND IT. - [speaking foreign language] - DID YOU KILL IT? - THE HOLY SYMBOL DREW ITS BLOOD, BUT... I DON'T THINK IT KILLED IT. IT HAS BOUGHT US A LITTLE MORE TIME THOUGH. WE MUST DESTROY THE RELIC BEFORE-- BEFORE THE BEAST RETURNS, ELSE... WE ALL DIE THIS NIGHT. [grunts] ARE YOU SURE THIS IS WISE? - WE HAVE NO WAY OF DESTROYING THE RELIC. WE MUST BURY IT, SO NO ONE ELSE HAS THE MISFORTUNE OF FINDING IT. AND THEN WE RETURN LATER, BETTER PREPARED. - RETURN? - WITH AN ARMY FROM JERUSALEM. 200 MEN TO FIGHT THAT DEMON. - 200, 500, 1,000! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? - WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? - SIEGE WEAPONS. MY FATHER HELPED BUILD SOME ONCE. A MACHINE OF WAR WILL BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SLAY THE BEAST. - YOU MAY BE CORREC TO A POINT. IT IS HELL SPAWN. MORTAL WEAPONS CANNOT KILL IT. - THE FEVER GROWS WORSE. [grunts] - HE NEEDS TO DIE. - NO! HE'S A KNIGHT. HE FOUGHT WITH HONOR. HE DOESN'T DESERVE AN INGLORIOUS DEATH. - THEN WE MUST KEEP THAT DOG ON A LEASH. - LET'S LEAVE THIS PLACE AND PUT THIS NIGHTMARE BEHIND US. ROBERT. ROBERT, YOU NEED TO EAT. ROBERT, I KNOW YOU'RE INSIDE THERE. I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME. DON'T LET THIS THING CONTROL YOU. FIGHT THIS THING. - [distorted voice] YOU WILL DIE HERE. YOUR SOUL WILL ROT IN HELL. - YOU ARE A KNIGHT! - YOUR SPIRITS ARE DEAD. - YOU ARE A CRUSADER. - [gagging groan] - HOW IS HE? - HE NEEDS AN EXORCIST. - MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE NEED FOOD. THAT WAS THE LAST. - WE HAVE PASSED NO ANIMALS FOR DAYS. AND STILL IT'S A DAY'S RIDE TO THE NEAREST TOWN. - HAVE NO FEAR. THE EVIL IS BEHIND US. ALLAH SUBHANAHU WA-TA'ALA IS GUIDING US ALONG A SAFE PATH. OR PERHAPS IT IS CHRIST, PEACE BE UPON HIM. IF WE BOTH PRAY, SURELY SOMEONE WILL BE LISTENING. EITHER WAY, WE WALK AS BROTHERS. WE WILL SURVIVE. - FATHER, FORGIVE ME FOR ALL MY SINS. [muttering] - SORRY. I-- CAN I PRAY WITH YOU? - OF COURSE. I THOUGHT YOU DOUBTED. - I SAW THAT DEMON WITH MY OWN EYES. FROM WHICHEVER HELL IT CAME, I SAW IT. THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS A HELL. - THEN...THERE MUS BE A HEAVEN. [snakes hissing] - SIR ROBERT? - AHH! - [screams] - [groans] [screams] - MAY THAT BE THE LAS OF THE DEMON SPAWN. - AT DAWN, WE GO DOWN. MAKE SURE HE'S DEAD. - WE'RE BEING WATCHED. - IT'S JUST YOUR IMAGINATION. - THIS VALLEY IS PERFEC FOR AN AMBUSH. - DOES THAT MEAN WE HAVE WILLINGLY WALKED INTO A TRAP? - WE'RE JUMPING AT SHADOWS. HE'S NOT HERE. COME ON. [deep rumbling and gasps] - IT CANNOT BE. [rumbling] - [gasps] - [grunts and screams] RUN! - OUR PROBLEMS ARE FAR FROM OVER. - CAREFUL. - CAREFUL. DON'T TOUCH IT. - IS THIS REALLY CHRIST'S BLOOD? - IT IS. - WHY DOES IT CONTINUE TO BLEED? - FOR ALL THE PAIN THAT CHRIST ENDURED. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - IF IT'S GOING TO KEEP TURNING UP EVERYWHERE WE ARE, THEN WE MAY AS WELL CONTINUE TO CARRY IT. AT LEAST THIS WAY WE KNOW WHERE IT IS. LET'S GO. - WHAT IS IT? - I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. - YOU CAN. YOU CAN. IT THRIVES ON OUR DESPAIR. STAY STRONG. - MY FRIEND... YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THESE. - LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE IN A SIEGE. - THIS WAS NO WAR BETWEEN MEN. - THESE WERE FIGHTING MEN HEADING FOR THE HOLY LAND. - WELL, THEY FOUND HELL RIGHT HERE. - THESE TRACKS ARE ALMOS TWO DAYS OLD. - THAT'S BEFORE WE WERE SHIPWRECKED. FRIAR GEORGE THOUGH THAT IT HAD BEEN DRAWN TOWARDS US. BUILDING ITS POWER TO CONFRONT US. WON'T BE LONG BEFORE I FINDS US AGAIN. - WHERE'S REBECCA? - REBECCA? - MY CHILDHOOD WAS SPEN IN A PLACE LIKE THIS. THE BEATING HEAR OF THE COMMUNITY. MY FATHER TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW. THE CRAFT, HOW TO USE THE FORGE, THE RIGHT TIME TO STRIKE THE STEEL. - [gasps] SPARE ME! - YOU ARE SAFE. - I HAVE SEEN THE DEVIL. THE FACE OF DEATH. THE REAPER, SHE DID THIS! SHE DID ALL OF THIS! - ENOUGH. YOU ARE SAFE. - YOU. YOU TURKS. YOU TURKS BROUGHT IT HERE. - I SAID YOU ARE SAFE. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - A SURVIVOR. - A KNIGHT? A KNIGHT HAS COME TO DELIVER US FROM EVIL. SAVE US, SIR. SAVE OUR SOULS. - SHH. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - MY LADY. SIMON, MY LADY. - AND WHAT HAPPENED HERE? - I WAS A FIGHTER. 1 OF 100 MEN ON OUR WAY TO SEEK NEW LIFE IN JERUSALEM. THEN--THEN THE WAR ENDED, BUT WE CONTINUED. CONTINUED TO FIND THAT NEW LIFE IN THE HOLY LANDS. WE ARRIVED AHEAD OF-- AHEAD OF TALES ABOU THAT DEMON WHO-- WHO FED FROM THE DEAD OF THE CRUSADES AS IT WAS SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING. IT HUNTED US FOR SPORT. HUNDREDS OF OUR MEN. MANY MORE FROM THE TOWN WERE ALL CUT DOWN. OUR STEEL IS USELESS! - YOU SAY IT HUNTED FOR SPORT? - IT TORMENTED ITS VICTIMS LIKE A CAT WOULD. IT CHASED THEM DOWN BEFORE SLAUGHTERING THEM. IT ENJOYED THE SLAYING. - IF HUNDREDS OF WARRIORS COULD NOT STOP THIS MONSTER, THEN WHAT CHANCE HAVE WE? - WE NEED A MIRACLE. - I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. WE JUST NEED TIME. - TIME? THERE IS NO TIME. - BUT...WE HAD WEAPONS TO KILL IT. THOUGH WE HAD NO TIME TO DEPLOY THEM. - WEAPONS? WHAT WEAPONS? - HERE. COME. LOOK HERE. SEE? SEE? WE HAD THE WEAPONS TO KILL THE BEAST. - PERHAPS NOW WE CAN MAKE A STAND. - BUT STEEL WILL NOT EVEN SCRATCH ITS HIDE. [distant cry] - SIMON? - NEVER! [grunts] - [screams] [grunts] - [sobbing] TWO DIED TO KILL ONE MAN. WHAT CHANCE HAVE WE AGAINS THE DEMON NOW? WE SHOULD RUN. - WE TRIED THAT. - WELL, THEN WE TRY HARDER. AND IF THERE IS A GOD, THEN WE PRAY THAT HE SAVES US. - "IF"? YOU'VE FOUND FAITH ONLY TO LOSE IT NOW? - THOSE WEAPONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE POWERFUL ENOUGH, AND THEY WERE OUR ONLY HOPE. - NO. THERE IS ANOTHER. WHAT BETTER WEAPON THAN THE BLOOD OF CHRIST? - AND IF THIS DOESN'T WORK? - [sighs] THEN WE NEED SOMETHING TO BUY US SOME TIME. THE BEAST CAN APPEAR WHEREVER WE ARE. IT'LL COME HERE. WHEN IT REACHES HERE, WE FIRE. CAN'T MISS AT THAT RANGE. - WHAT WAS IT LIKE, JERUSALEM? - IT WAS LIKE THIS. WAR TORN. FRIGHTENING. THAT'S WHEN THE DREAMS STARTED. - DREAMS? - AHH, DREAMS OF BATTLE. FIGHTING. ALWAYS VERY VIVID. THEN WHEN WE GOT HERE AND FOUND THE RELIC... I HAD DREAMS OF THE DEMON. - YOU HAD PREMONITIONS? - I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THAT'S HOW THE DEMON KNEW WE WERE TAKING THE RELIC OUT OF THE HOLY LAND. IT WAS USING ME. NOW I JUST DREAM OF RETURNING TO MY LAND AND FINDING SOMEONE TO SHARE IT WITH ME. - AND INSTEAD YOU MET AN INDENTURED SLAVE. - NO. I MET AT WOMAN WHO JUST DIDN' KNOW SHE WAS FREE. [demon roars] - [gasps] IT'S COMING. WHERE IS IT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? [demon roars] - RUN! RUN! [demon roars] [demon screams] GO! [demon roars] [demon roars] FIRE! [demon roars and screams] THE RELIC! THROW ME THE RELIC! [sighs] WE DID IT. [tense orchestral music]
