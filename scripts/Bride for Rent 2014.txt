It is at this time... I now pronounce you husband and wife. Hey! Nitoy! Nitoy! Hey! Open the door! 'Bro, get up! - Nifoy! Open the door! Papsi, gel up! Get ready! Ready? Yikes! Hi! Good morning!

Get out! - Hello! Lala! Rocco, are you behaving well while Fm away'? Of course I'm behaved! Can't you just enjoy your vacation there in Germany? Are you all right? Yeah, you have nothing to worry about. I'm just at home. It's so boring here. This is why your father keeps getting mad at me. He says k spoil you too much. Well, to me, you're still the best Lala in the whole wide world. Digital kiss! - Bye, Rocco! Bye. Bye! Bye! You bad boy! Bye! Lala, are you still there? - So sorry, dear... that I won't be there for your birthday tomorrow. My doctor says... I still need a week to recover. - Good morning, Sir. What gift does my grandson want? Well, aside from signing the release of my trust fund tomorrow? Dear, you'll be twenty-five. You'll get it for sure. Well, today is gonna be a great day. Love you, Lala! I love you too. I had a hard time convincing my partners in awarding you this project. But I told them what you told me. That it's about time we try new ideas. As you know, your father... your fathefs company has been producing our ads for decades now. So they're already used to it. Well, Uncle Cito... I promise you we will deliver better than his company. Besides, they keep giving you those dramatic... heart-to-heart ads. It's so outdated. I wanna show the people that... Ahead Financial can offer insurance better. Quick and easy! I just hope you don't forget our promise to our clients... that commitment lasts forever. Oh, my Godson. You're still allergic to the words "commitment" and "forever". I just... I just find those words hard to believe. But don't worry. We'll put that in the copy. Okay. I'll take your word for it. Here. We don't normally give... down payments... but because you asked for it and... because I want to support your new production house... I'm giving this to you. Just be sure you keep our timetables. The ad is a crucial pan of our fiftieth anniversary campaign. Well, we won't let you down. Promise. - Okay. Tomorrow, I will be a very rich man! I'm finally getting my trust fund from Lala! Eighty million! - Eighty million, bro! Cheers to that! - Cheers! Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be in Macau with Gretchen right now? Dude, come on! We broke up! What? Dude, sorry to hear that. Are you okay? Come on! I'm with you guys and all these happy people. Don't pity me! It was bound to happen anyways. It's over! Cheers! Gretchen! Hey! It was bound to happen anyway, huh? Look, the whole relationship idea... if?" it's just not my thing. And it's not like we were gonna get married, right? Happy birthday. Ouch... Let's party! Everybody! Drinks on me! Let's go! Happy birthday m me! Cheers! - Cheers! Happy birthday m me! Happy birthday! Party! Party! Let's go! Hello? When are you going to pay your ten million peso debt? Ten million? You owe me ten million.

Well, of course I'll pay you. I'll pay you right away. No problem. Make sure of it. How can we be that stupid? I can't believe we gambled our client's down payment. It's because we got drunk. Duh. Come on, guys. Have you forgotten what day it is? It's your birthday! - Right! Happy birthday, bro! It means I'm getting may trust fund today. So, I'm a rich man! We'll be able to pay my debt from last night. And we can deliver Uncle Cito's commercial. Right? No problem! And most importantly, I have tons of extra cash. Ah. Is that a"? This isn't enough, huh? Do we have to move again? Oh, no no no no! Don't you worry. I'll keep on auditioning until I get a job. I will land a major role. Right! - I'll get paid a ton! Okay. Is the Dela Cruz family giving up? Never! It's just a debt! Right! - We're family! Let's go! One! Two! Three! - Fight! Fight! Marriage certificate? Yes! It was stipulated here in your trust fund. You can get it when you reach the age of twenty-five... provided you're married. H' you're not, then Fm afraid you'll have to wait... until you reach the age of thrity-five. Wait, are you sure that's my account? It was amended recently. You might want to consult with your grandmother. Lala! Yes, dear. Why didn't you tell me I had to get married first... before I can claim my trust fund. What'? Well, that's what the lawyer told me! Didn't I tell you? No! Oh, I did! I already told you. I told you that during the night when you came home from a party. You were even throwing up. I was drunk! But still, I did tell you. Lala, seriously?! Darling... I just finished with my stem cell therapy. They took away decades from my face. Please, I ask you... don't bring them back. Okay? And besides... there shouldn't be a problem. After five years of being together. You're bound to marry Gretchen, right? Happy birthday, dear! Love you! Bye! Lala, no! No! No, no, no! Guys! Gretchen... I made a huge mistake. I was so stupid.

There. There. Are you okay? There you go. I'm so sorry. Did we give you a shock? But how? When? Well, we met at a coffee shop. And then I saw her. She were drinking coffee. It was love at first sight. Wait, I don't drink coffee. You saw me listening to some tunes while I was drinking orange juice. Then you found me pretty. Right? No. Honey... You were drinking coffee. In the coffee shop. Right, I'm drinking coffee. - Yes. Then I saw you. Just like in the movies. It was love at first sight. Powerful. Whirlwind romance! Um, and then, out of the blue... he proposed to me. We got married! Yes! Civil! - Civil! Oh, my honey. Congratulations, okay? Thank you so much. But I need one request from you. Yes. Anything. We'll do it- - Of course! Anything, Lala. I don't want a civil wedding. Marriage is sacred... so I want a priest to officiate the wedding. And I need to be part of my grandson's wedding. Right? Uh... I want you to get married again. And I need to be there. Huh? I'm so excited! - Lala. I've got to go and call my friends, and make all my calls now. No. No. - Okay? Lala! Lalalala... lalalala. Lalalala, lalala... lalala! Your grandmother wants a church wedding? As in she wants us to get married for real? - Come here. Just keep quiet. What if she finds out... we lied about our civil wedding? - Come on. Get in. Hey, wait! What about my family, Rocco? Getting married for real wasn't part of our deal. There's nothing we can do about it. We have to get married. Let's just get an annulment after I get my money. What? Just like that. I'm too young to be annuled. Rocco, I admit it. You're handsome, rich, you have it all. I do have a crush on you, but... no, I'm not ready yet. I cannot get married yet. I don't want to do it. Hey, Rocky... - No. I can't. I don't want to. I don't want to marry you either. I won't even take you for a one night stand. I don't even know where you came from. That's too much. So how much do you want for you to agree? I've encountered greedy people like you before. That's all you wanted from me, right? So, how much? Name your price. Wait. Don't tell me to wait. You're just calculating. You're just counting the number of heads you plan to give money to. So, how much are you? You think too highly of yourself. Sorry, Rocco, but I'm not for sale. Oh! Rocky, wait! Rocky! There! Taxi! - Taxi! It's Rocky. It's Rocky. - Wait. Rocky! - Papsi, what happened? We got evicted! - Why didn't you just call me? Sheesh. Get inside, hurry. This, too. Get inside, so you shouldn't get sick. The other things. - Here. Get the trunk open. Here. - Brother, hurry up. It's getting wet. Hurry. Get in, Papsi. Yes, that too. There's more. Close the door. Thank you so much. You're so generous. You know, if my wife is still alive... she'd be so happy to see you... because she's a fan of yours. Really? Yes. You're welcome. Your daughter looks like a good child, doesn't she? Oh, she really is. Rocky! - Yes, Papsi? Well... can I talk to her in private? Okay. Thank you! - Okay. Ma'am, thank you. - Thank you, Ma'am Lala. You're welcome. Good night, Grampapsi. Papsi. Good night. - Okay. I'll just be in the room. - Okay. I leave her to you, okay? - Okay. Yes, Papsi. Go to sleep. Lala, I mean, Ma'am, I'm really really sorry. I didn't mean to trick you or to lie to you. We just desperately needed the money... so, please, forgive me. - Okay. Get up and sit on the chair. Here - I'm very very sorry. Forgive me. There. Wait... is Rocky your real name? Yes! it's really my name. I really am Racquelita Dela Cruz. - I knew it! Huh? 'Yes! I knew that you were faking it. Weren't you? I know my grandson. He doesn't believe in marriage. Huh? Now, I need to ask you a favor. Do you promise to tell me the truth from now on? Yes, yes. I promise I'll tell the truth and nothing but the truth, so swear to God. Why did you do that? Because, ma'am... Rocco said he needed money. I knew it. Rocco is behind this, isn't he? Well, I guess you can say that. My dear... you know, I'm in the twilight of my years. Money is so easy to leave behind, but... what will happen to him when I'm gone? I want to hire you. What? - Yes. You keep pretending. You'll push through with the wedding. It's not going to be real. I will take care of everything. That's all you have to do. You know, I want to teach him a lesson. I want him to leam how to value what he has and value other people. I will triple whatever offer he gave you. Please, Rocky. As a mother, I beg you. Help me, please. Ladies and gentlemen... a warm round of applause... ...for Mr. and Mrs. Roderico Espiritu Jr. You may now kiss the bride. Rocky! Kiss! You better be good. This is like my first kiss ever. Are you nuts? I should even deduct this from your salary. Hey, it's my first kiss. You should be happy. I bet you can't wait to kiss me. Okay. Here we go. More! Oh, you. Rocky? YES? Open the door. I'm going to sleep. Okay, wait a sec. Okay, good night. Hey, wait! Hey! Yes? I will sleep on the bed. Not happening. - Wait! You can't sleep here. I'm sleeping here. Is that so? I need lots of space. I'm a big girl. Aaah! I'll call the police! There's an assault! Ah! Harassment! No way. Get out. Get out. You sleep in the couch. Hey! Let me remind you that I am paying for all of these. I paid for this bed. I'm even paying you. It means... - Oh, really now? Let us see. Yes, I am here because I need your money. But if not for me... you wouldn't even have money. So, the bottomline is you need me more than I need you. Am I right? OMG! With that kind of face? It is confirmed that you need me more than I need you. Are you nuts? No way. I will set a few rules and regulations. Imposing the law leads to a happier life together. As said by Senator Miriam. Rule number one... a happy wife means a happy life. If you don't want to have problems... you must keep me happy. Okay? Ag T99? Okay! Fine! Then number two... I can add more rules whenever I want to. That's not fair. I object. Oops, please refer to rule number one... which you just agreed... that you should always make me happy. So, go rule number two. And then rule number three... which is the very important rule among all the rules. Quoted from the movie "No Other Woman"... don't you dare fall in love with me. Are you serious? That's not going to be a problem. My charm is powerful. There you go. Sign here to make this document legal and binding. Okay, fine. If it's going to make you shut up. And I'll add more tomorrow. About eighty-two. - Here. I'm sleeping now. No! - Ouch! What?! You'll sleep outside, remember? It's the first night. Can't we settle this with a coin toss? Um, okay. Let's do that. I don't want you saying that I'm being unfair. Okay then. Heads, I sleep on the bed. Tails, I sleep on the couch. Game. Okay. Two, three. - Two, three. Javier INCOMING CALL Hello, Javier. Hey, bro., wake up! We're paying our debt to the casino today. Is Rocky going with us? Well... she's still sleeping. Just like a baby. I hope she never wakes up. Okay, get over here. Hurry. - Okay, bro., bye. Perhaps, we can get my trust fund now. What's that? Here. There's another amendment?! Yes! You can get the initial ten million today. As for the remaining seventy million... you will get one million for each week that you stay married. One million a week?! Oh my gosh! Wait, think of it. Cannot be borrowed. Zero. From the exponent. Seventy weeks is seventeen and half months. You just need five million for now, right? That's just five weeks! Ouch! Well, of course if Madame Avelina finds out any anomaly... there will be legal consequences. Why'? Are you saying we're cheating? Why'? Is there any reason for me to think that you're cheating? No!

If I didn't come up wih an alibi... you wouldn't have gotten your trust fund. Just put it there. You're taking too long. Hurry up! - I don't even know why I'm doing this for you. I already carried most of it. I'm done. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Oh no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Rule number four. My new rule is that you're not allowed to complain. For every complain from you... we will donate clothes or shoes to charity. Okay? What kind of rule is that? You're complaining? What are you doing? Complaining again? Stop! Stop! Stop! One, two, three. This is unfair! Unfair? I won fair and square. We had a clear agreement. Whoever won will sleep on the bed. Heads won, and that's me. You think you've won. You're wrong.

It's been a week, right? The lawyer is fixing it up. It will come. Relax! No, Rocco. I can't relax. The client keeps calling me about the ad. I don't know what to say anymore. You know what? Let's just go to Uncle Cito and tell him the truth. We can't go to Uncle Cito because if we do... we'll lose the account for sure. Just relax. I'll do something about it, okay? I'm done! Deal with this yourselves. Hey! MM! Mik! Maybe Mik is right. Maybe if you tell Uncle Cito... You don't have a say on this. So, just shut up. Who's this? It's Papsi! Both of you, keep quiet. Wait. Ladies and gentlemen, quiet, okay? - Yeah, yeah. Chinese only. Hello? Hello, Papsi. What is it? I'm at work right now. Well... um... It's okay. Mikoy's in the hospital. What?! Why? What happened?

I will send you some money. I got this. Really? Thank you. Just look for Nitoy Dela Cruz. I already texted them. I told them... that my boss is in the Philippines. He will bring the money. So, just look for him. Don't worry. We can take care of it. Okay? Come on. Let's go. I told Papsi that you're Chinese! Are we sure, for this? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. Papsi... I'm not very good at English. My head hurts just for even trying. Me too. - Me too, Papsi. We are very lucky to meet you. You're our savior. Yes, yes. Thank you for giving us money. You got it, Papsi. Yes, son, that's right. Rocky told us... you are strict. We got mad at you. You make our princess cry. Please, don't make princess cry. Excuse me. That is not true. Our boss is so kind and obedient. What your daughter told you is not true. You should have spoken in Filipino from the start. You just gave our Papsi a hard time. You know... your boss looks like a good guy. Please tell him... we are grateful to him for helping us out. Rocky is the only person we can rely on. She loves us so much. This is the first time in her life... that she is away from her family. Please tell your boss thank you for all the help. AN. Paps". Paps"! All her life... Huh? Why'? Huh? You-you ah... - What'? Picture, picture! Picture, picture. Game. - Ah okay! Picture! Picture! Qkay. Qkay. Okay, one more time? Only... you. - One more? Ah! The two of us. Okay. - Yes! One, two, get set, go! One, two, three. Say "Please! " Click. Please! Thank you! Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. Tell them... I love them very, very much. Tell them, she loves them. Ah! I love you so much. Ah! I mean... - What? Rocky loves you so much. She asked me to tell you. Yes! We also love her so much. I want to see them so badly. When she has enough money... she will buy a pair of contact lenses so she can see you. Rocky's eyes not clear? Don't forget... to drink your medicine. Darna! What? Daw-Dawna'? Dama'? I call your daughter for you. Okay. - Good idea. I call. Hello? Your father wants to talk to you. Here. Hello! Paps" Paps".! Papsi, I miss you so much. Just call me if you need anything. I'm here for you. My daughter. Papsi, I just have one request. - Sure. Anything. What'? That's it? Deliver the hug to my daughter. You take care of my daughter, okay? Sis, me too. Thank you! Hello? Take care. You also take care. We love you. I love you, Papsi. - We love you, Rocky. Thank you! Thank you. Okay, okay. - Inside, inside. Papsi, slowly. Careful. Papsi's scent. Onyok's scent. Mmm! I missed how they smell. Awkward. Uh... thank-thank-thank you. For... for giving the money to my family. Shit! Mik is here Mik went to Uncle Cito! Mik, what did you do? I told him the truth. That we spent all of the down payment. I will talk to him. It's too late. He already gave the project to your dad. What?! What the hell's your problem?! - Hey! Wait! So! What? - You've gone too far! You know I'm doing everything I can... to get the money back! - Stop it! It's our company too! Let's go! - What? You take care of him. - Stop him. I'll take care of him. What are friends are for'?! Rocco, you shouldn't have done that. Stay out of it. You have no idea how important that account is to me. Mik is your friend. I'm sure he had just wanted to help. He's not my friend. He's just my employee. Just like you. You're just my employee. So just do your job and stay out of my personal life! Rocco, I just want to help you too. I'm not a charity case. I don't need your help! And anyway, the account is gone. So, that means I no longer need you. So, stay out of my life! All of you! I never saw him that mad before. He is so mean. I don't think I can still go on, Lala. Stop crying- Come. I'll show you something. That's Rocco with his father. You know, Rod was Rocco's hero. He loved his father so dearly... so much. But, you know, as they say... Sometimes, the people that you love the most... those are the people that will hurt you the most. You know why? Rocco was the one who found out... that Rod had another family. And Rod wanted to leave. Rocco begged him. He pleaded to his father to stay. But he still left Rocco? Yes. That was the last time... I heard him say, "Please". And then after a few years... the mother died. That was the last straw. That's when it all fell apart. Since then... he became reckless. He became angry. It was so unlike him. My grandson is not a heartless monster. You know... his heart was just broken for a longtime. Even my love won't mend it. And I don't think it will ever heal. So, I'm sorry, Rocky. Because I got you involved. If you really want to quit... I will let you go. I won't stop you... and I will still honor the promise... that I made to pay. I'll be the one to tell Rocco. That I hired you. So... You're giving up on him? Boy! Good evening. Are you the new neighbors? Yes, Ma'am. The wife's not home yet? We had a bit of an argument. I see! It it's just a little argument... all you have to do is apologize... with a bit of sweetness. That's how he's kept me for fifty years. Wow. Fifty years? Fifty-one, next week. Well, if you need anything... feel free to come and see us. I am Granny Czarina, by the way. And this is Mr. Benjamin. Well, nice meeting you. And welcome to the neighborhood! Good night. Okay, goodbye! OkaV- Rocky is here. Please come home. I need to talk to you. Lala. Rocco, dear. You're here. Ah, Racquelita and I have been talking and, um... how do I say this? Well, you see... I need to tell you something. Um... I asked you to come over because Rocky... Lala! I just asked him to pick me up. That's all. Here. I took these from Lala's photo album. Souvenirs for you. I know these first steps are fragile. But Fm here to guide you. I'll always be by his side. I'll never let go. So this is why Uncle Citds project was so important to you, right? You know, Rocky... the truth is I wanna be better than my father. He's so good. In every blessing... He can make all married couples look like they're in love. Look at that. A faithful husband. But in reality... in real life... it's all fake. Like us? Rocky, sorry if I yelled at you earlier. O. M. G. From what I just heard... you're now better than your dad. My mom used to tell me before she passed away... "The one who knows how to say sorry... is the better person. " So that means... you're now better than anyone else. So, congratulations! You're now closer to becoming better! Yey! You really think I can be... a better person than my dad? Of course. Rocky, thanks for coming home with me. It really means a lot. Rocky... Oh? He might still be angry. Don't think about that. Just show him that you are sincere... and he will surely understand. So go, go, go! Let's go. I really have no excuse for my behavior. Everything is my fault. And, Uncle, I'll understand if you don't give me a second chance. But, if you do... I promise, I will give it my all. Rocky! He gave me another chance! - Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! - Um... Rocco? Rocco? Rocco... A". what's that? Express hug delivery from Uncle Cito? Um, well... that was a "remnant hug" from Mr. Nitoy. Huh? Huh? Um, yeah. Let's go. Well? Guys, I'm sorry. I really am. Well? Fine, fine. Apology accepted. Yey! The product stands for trust... security, someone you can lean on... someone you can depend on for life... someone who will always be there... no matter what. They're making a lifetime commitment with you. Amazing! Sounds like a married couple. Nice. ' Got it! What? - What? Why don't we make an AVP about married couples? Their stories match the campaign's theme! We can look for couples married for five years... then we can move on to ten years... fifteen years, twenty years! Until we find a couple who's been married... for more than fifty years. Right? That way, we can show how a relationship is strengthened through the years. How a... simple vow can turn into a lifetime commitment... and how something can last forever. WOW! I'm so amazed for that very sweet word. Forever? It's not you, man. So? People change. Who knows? I might start believing... in "forever. " Are you sure? Well, well, well! ll we all agree... then let's begin looking for "forever! " Nehey'. - Okay. Game! You were briefed with the questions, right? Just be spontaneous. - Okay. Ready. Okay, go. And smile! Yeah! Happy thoughts! Quiet on the set! Camera! Rolling! Action! How long have you been married? Uh, five years. - Five years. What is the secret to along lasting marriage? Well, first and foremost, we're friends. We know everything about each other. Fats and all. You're so cute. As we grow old... Yuck! You're disgusting! - I hope we never change. How dare you say that. Don't you fart? I do, but not that loud. And definitely not that smelly. But I understand. Oh! You're over reacting! - Woah! That stinks! Wooh! You act like a grabage truck just passed by. Yuck! You're tasting it! Yummy? - Tastes like raw eggs! We just always... put the other person's interest first. Extra strong! What about the other broken fixtures in this house? Come on. Hurry up! We gotta look for nails. And hammer. Okay, noted. Check. For the kitchen! What do you think? Our secret? I still court her to this day. Nice! - Yeah! Sit down. You cooked these? Yes! For you! There's a miracle going on. Have some rice. Here. Hey, wait. What happened here? - Huh? What's this? Nothing. It's just the hot cooking oil. Don't worry about it. Let's eat. Don't worry about it. Twenty-five years. Yes, twenty-five years. Always have a sense of humor. Yes. Here. - That's a lot. This one. Okay. How about my lips... He)', no! Sheesh! He was courting me... when he started picking me up all the time. I felt like he's someone... who'd really take care of me. Have some coffee. Oh, ifs Papsi. Wait a minute. Hello, Papsi. Oh, K almost forgot. Chin's birthday is coming up. Too bad, I can't be there. Wear this. Come on. This? Yes. Where are we going? - Trust me. Wait! I can't see anything! - I'll help you. Slowly. Slowly now. Rocky! Paps".! My brothers! You don't know how much this means to the family. Big hug! Let's eat! Thank you so much. Thank you. I'm so happy! Happy birthday! Even today, he still makes me laugh. Just have fun together. Screwdriver... You're such a pervert! - Hey! Oh! Ouch! Well, you have to spice up your marriage. Yeah. - Yeah. Make a lot of... Yeah. Censor that, please. And I shall remind you... of the promise I made to love you each day... even as my hair tums white. Hey! What are you doing here? Well, I just wanted to remind you... What'? - that we'll leave early tomorrow. Oh? Oh? - Don't forget. That's it? - We'll be going to Lala's house tomorrow. Okay. Go back to sleep. Uh, Lala, I heard dad's back from L.A. He arrived this morning. Why don't we have dinner'? Dinner'? Rocky, the family... everyone! Yeah! Yeah. Lala, salad? Okay. Alright! How long have you been married? Ah... fifty-one years. A lot of people have told me... I could leave my husband any time. Because he will never remember. But! made a promise... that I will never leave his side. It was a vow we made. To have and to hold. For richer and for poorer. In sickness and in health. I think that really is the secret. Who are you? I love you. Oh, you. You know, no need for a coin toss. You can have the bed. No! I've hogged the bed for too long now. I will sleep on the couch this time... so I can experience it for once. No! Let's just both sleep here... beside each other on the bed. Wait! Wait! Wait! Huh? - I feel so harassed! Wait! This is harassment! - What? You can't do that to me. - Ouch! Really now?! - Is that so? The promise I made to love you each day... even as my hair tums white. We shall relive the past... and I shall remind you... of the promise I made to love you each day... even as my hair tums white... even as my hair tums white. Oh, no. Wrong, wrong. This can't be. No. Erase! Erase! Erase! You need to leave. I'll sleep here. Go. Get out. Go. Get out. - Rocky, what's wrong? Rocco, please, get out. Come on. What did I do? - Move it! What's wrong? Hurry. Wait, did I do something wrong? - Good night! Good night! Go away now. Oh no! Rocky, what did you do? You will know if she's the one or he's the one. I just knew. It was like a gut feeling. I couldn't think of anyone else but her. When k saw Pia, I knew... t knew on-right that second, I knew that... that she was the girl I was gonna marry. But of course, you have to be honest with your partner. That is the best foundation for a tong tasting relationship. Nothing beats that. Oh, Rocky! Lala! What? Lala! - Why are you crying? What happened? Come here! Sit down. What is it? Lala... we did something last night. - What?! No, not that! We had a "MOMOL." What's a "MOMOL?" Make Out Moment of Love. MOMOL. But it was quick. Nothing really ha-I don't know. How do I say this? I think I'm falling for him. I don't know if Rocco feels the same, but... I don't want to lie to him anymore. I want to tell him the truth. If we tell him we made a deal... he's going to be shattered. But if we keep going on like this... the more he's going to be hurt. What are we going to do? Um... why don't you tell him... that you want an annulment? Right? - But, Lala- No. That's it. That's it! There's- - Huh? Yes, there's no other way. Your five week deal is over anwyay. Right? That's your deal. At least, you can just tell him... that you're following the contract. Rocco, I have something important to tell you. I want an annulment. Let's finish this. Just sign this document. No. I can't do it. Rocco, let's end our little charade. I can't- How do I do this? Oh, no. it's Rocco. Hello? Rocky, we'll have dinner with Lala tonight. I'll just meet you at the dinner, okay? I just need to go somewhere. - But, Rocco, I still have someth- Rocky, H! see you there. Bye. What now? Thank you. Maricel... call Pepito and eat at that table. Order anything you want from the menu. Lala. Racquelita! Is Rocco with you? What's going on? Did you talk to him already? What did he say? - He's not here with me. He told me to go ahead and meet him here. So, I haven't told him yet. You haven't told him? Not yet. I don't know- Lala! Rocky! Hey! Hi, Lala! Hi! - Good evening, Ma'am. How are you? Fine. We're all here together. What's this dinner for? Rocco hasn't told me yet. There he is! It's your favorite restaurant. - Yes. Hi. Come here. Rocco, what is this dinner for? Tonight is a very special night. I hope you'll be proud of me. But, Rocco... Oh... Good evening, Ma. Son! What are you doing here? I was invited. Huh? Hi, Ma. Hi there. - Hi. Rocco! Long time, no see! How long has it been? A couple of years? Rocco, my son... I have a slight resentment towards you. Do you really hate me that much that... you didn't invite me to your wedding? Rocco... it was a joke! Loosen up! Now, do me a big favor and... introduce me to this beautiful young lady beside you. Dad... this is Rocky... my wife. Rocky... this is my dad. Roderico Espiritu, Sr. Ah, hel-hello. Pleased to meet you. No, dear. The pleasure is mine. This is my stepmom... Aunt Marie. Hi, Rocky. - Hello. Hello. Rocco. - Hello. What's so special about tonight, darling? I never dreamed... 'Cause I always thought that dreaming was for kids. Just a childish thing. And I could swear... Love is just a game that children play... No more than a game. Til k met you... I never knew what love was. Til k met you... this feeling seems to grow more every day... I love you more each day. Rocky... come. - Huh? Rocco, what's this? A few weeks ago... this woman told me that she believes I can become a better person. She told me... that if a person knows how to apologize... then that person is a step closer to becoming better. Rocco. Rocco. And that's what I wanna do now. Lala... Lala, I'm sorry. Rocco, stop. Lala, I'm sorry that I lied to you. The truth is I got Rocky... to pose as my wife... so that I could get my trust fund. Rocco, stop it. Rocco... - Rocky. It's okay. Dad... I asked you to come here because I wanna set things right. Lala, didn't you tell me you always wanted me to become a better person? So, here I am... taking responsibility for what I did. Don't say sorry, dear. No, Lala, but I want to. And there's one more thing I wanna say. Rocky... I have fallen in love with you. I am in love with you. But if we want this relationship to work... we have to start with honesty. So, I'm being honest to you now. Rocco, wait. No... Rocky, I love you. Can you love me, too... and never, ever leave? Please? Rocco, please get up. Huh? - Please. Okay. Yes? I don't deserve this. What? Hey, what are you talking about? I'm the one... who hasn't been honest with you. Rocco, I'm sorry. But our marriage is a fraud. It's fake. Lala and I met. She talked to me. She asked me to help her fix you. Mag When I found out that he was capable... of faking his marriage just to get the money... I got afraid! So, I wanted to set him straight before I die. So, the wedding wasn't real? Rocco, at first... I agreed to it because my family desperately needed the money. But right now... I don't know anymore. Rocco, sorry. I'm so sorry. I hope you can forgive me. What's going on? I'm really, really, really sorry. But please, don't be mad... at Rocky. It was my fault. But I can assure you, and I swear to you... I did it with the purest intentions. But that doesn't give you the right to play with my feelings. What are you doing? Rocco... What is going on?! What is going on?! Is there anything even true right now?! Rocco. Rocco, listen to me. Despite all the pretense... believe me, I did love you. I did love you. Believe me. I do love you. Please, forgive me, Rocco. Sorry. SOFT)'- How do you expect me to believe that? Rocco. Rocco, wait! You know what? This is the first time... I thought I could believe in something real. That something can last forever. But... turns out, the joke was on me? That was quite a performance. You made me believe... someone could truly love me. Rocco! Rocco! I'm such an idiot, guys. Now look who got a dose of his own medicine. I guess my dad was right. I can't do anything right. Guys, I'm sorry. Sorry for everything. We stick together, bro. From cradle to grave. I'm sorry, Papsi, for lying to you. I'm really sorry. I hope you can forgive me. You know... your mother and I did not raise you to become a liar. I know that, Papsi. That's why I'm so sorry. I know we don't have much money. I also know that your brothers and I don't have much to offer. But we have our dignity. That's why first thing tomorrow... the remaining money you sent us that I saved... we will return. Stop crying- Li'I sis... this might help a bit. Let us take care of you from now on. Oh, bro. Give me a hug! Group hug. We can do this. I promise... we will return all the money you gave us. You don't have to give that back. But I won't be at peace if you don't take the money. Please. Rocky, I'm really very sorry. Lala, do you think Rocco will ever forgive me? Rocco! I'm so sorry for all the stupid decisions I made. Grandson, I'm sorry for causing you pain, too. I love you. I love you, too. So much. Rocco, have you talked to your dad? No. What about Rocky? She was here the other day. She was asking me if you could ever forgive her. Dear, I'd like to ask you a favor. She mentioned to me... that you were doing a project. I'd like you to give me an interview. Lala, it's only for married couples. - What? But I've been married to your grandpa for so many years. We've never separated. He simply went to heaven first. Please, Rocco. I miss being interviewed. Please. Do this for your Lala. Qkay... what's your first question? How long have you been married? And what is the secret to a long lasting relationship? Yeah, but before that, I'd like to thank you for the interview. Because finally now, I will be able to tell you... my love story. The secret? Your Grandpa and I chose to love each other every waking day... until the last day of his life. You know, some people think that forever is not possible. Because most of them think that forever is perfect. But nobody's perfect, right? I was not a perfect wife to your grandpa... and he was not a prefect husband. We just chose to believe in forever. And so, you see what we've learned? See? Forever... is giving one another unlimited chances to love you right everyday. Rocco, there's one thing I wish for you. Just believe in love. Love, and beloved. Give it a chance. Love and forgive. Look at you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything, son. I'm sorry for everything, too. My son. Ah! What?! Cut! Cut! What's going on?! Sorry. - Don't touch me! Were in take 27. - Please deal with this girl. I'm very, very sorry. I'm sorry. - Sorry, baby. I'll take care of it. So sorry. You know, you're getting on my nerves. - Wait! Wait! What's your name? - I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! Wait, let me explain. We never talked about having to-kiss, you know? And I'm the type of person who doesn't kiss somebody I don't love... and if we don't have a relationship. So what is your name? Racquelita dela Cruz, a. k. a. Rocky! You know, Rocky... - Yes. You are the worst actor I have ever seen! I'm getting fed up with you! We are shooting for a love song. How will this music video look romantic... if your acting is so stiff?! What?! Ah... we-we can- - What are we going to do now?! You want the viewers to get headaches when they watch this music video?! Oh, no! Okay! Let's do it again! Come on! I'm ready! But can you kiss? - Okay, I'm ready! Just with the "look of love" you took twenty-seven takes, right? Look of love! Rocky, k got you another audition. For what? Where and when? Tonight!

Yeah, it still doesn't sound right. Wrong, wrong. - Sheesh! What do you want? Okay! I can give you a dozen children. Even if they're just one year apart, I can give birth to them. It will hurt, but I can do it. Twelve. Like a dog. Rocky... the answer is simple. You deserve to be accepted... because you can accept somebody like me. No more lies. No more scripts. I promise!
