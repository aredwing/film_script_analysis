Or she could be poor and mean. I mean, I-I have no idea what she's like. It's-- And there's my father, right? I look at guys on the street every day-- regular guys walking down the street. And depending on my mood, I imagine that any one of them could be my father. This guy. How about this guy? Hi, Dad. Then I have to picture these two people having sex. Okay, maybe they're not together now. But at least 30 years ago... they had to hook up in order to have me, right? Mix and match, mix and match, all these people together. I can't help feeling... that if I'd been raised by at least one of my real parents... I wouldn't be such a nervous person, you know? I might be living a completely different life in a totally different city. I could be married to a totally different person with a different job. I mean, how do I know? I don't. Anything's possible. Well, the mystery of your unknown self is about to unfold. Your mother lives in San Diego, California. Her name is Valerie Swaney. Valerie Swaney? I told you it wouldn't take long. Can we arrange a meeting soon? How's, um-- How's next month? No, no. I told Nancy I'd do it sooner. I-I've been driving her crazy. Because you can't name your son? I've just been distracted and tense ever since the baby was born. - A little unsteady? - Preoccupied. I heard a song 'bout clouds and rainbows I hum a tune that sings like a dove Found some words about anything Anything but love I paint a picture of my prison With blue and grey for the skies above Framed and signed with a title Anything but love He had to go but I won't miss him I have got better things to do Like writing stories and painting pictures Of anything but love Oh, anything but love Anything but love Nancy? I'm in the bedroom! Big news. I got big news. Hi, sweetie. You look great. Why are you dressed like that? Did you forget about our date? Oh, my God! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - No. It's okay, you're here now. - No, no, no. I feel so bad. We're not gonna fight about it. Look at you. You look so sexy. But I want to tell you what I forgot. - Take your shoes off. - No, no, wait, wait. We have to talk. - We have to talk. Talk. - No. No. Honey, no talking. No, no, we have to talk about wh-why I'm late. - Control freak, huh? - No. Yeah, maybe I am a control freak. - Control freak. Don't! - Nap time's over. - Nap time's over. Wait, wait. I'll get him. I'll get him. You don't have to put your pants on to get the baby. Honey, do you think we're ever gonna have sex? Definitely. There, buddy, Yeah. How ya doin'? It's okay. Yeah, yeah. You okay? - We'll be out in one second. - Oh. I feel like I'm keeping you from something. No. No, no, no. This is a priority. Is this a bad time for your wife? 'Cause, you know, I could come back. Not at all. We just need a couple of minutes. This is crazy. I mean, all right, I feel guilty 'cause I missed the date. I just gotta tell her. What am I afraid of, right? This is stupid. - Hey, here you go. - No, no. This is good. - What? - This is good. You stay with Daddy. - Keep his hands occupied. - Oh, Nancy. Nancy. No, no, no. Honey. Honey. Can't we make another date, please? Thi-- Sweetie, this is-- Sweetie, he's looking right down at you. This isn't-- Oh. Oh, no, no. No. No. Oh, no, no, no. My real mother lives in San Diego. - What? - That's what I was trying to tell you. I went to the adoption agency, and they found my real mother. Just like that? You walked in, they found her? Well, it was the second trip, actually. - Ohh. - I know, I know. - Honey. - I know. So listen... why don't you put something on and come over and say hello to Tina. - Who? - The woman who helped arrange everything. This woman's in our apartment right now? She's here? Yeah. Well I-- You know, I-I was trying to tell you before... but you got all sexed up and everything-- Well, I got sexed up because we had a date, not because I'm some kind of freak or something. - I didn't say you were a freak. Did I say you were a freak, honey? - No. - No, no. Come on, this is good, right? - Hi. I'm Tina Kalb. I'm sorry to burst in on you like this... but Mel said he didn't want to waste any time. That's all right. Nancy understands how important this whole thing is. - Great. The baby's gorgeous, by the way. It looks just like Mel. - Ohh. Thanks. Really? You really think so? Everybody always says he looks like me. Well, what do I know? I'm just another 30-year-old woman desperate for a baby of her own. Your husband doesn't want to have kids? Yeah, I'm in the middle of a divorce, actually. I just can't seem to part with the ring. - Sorry. - Oh, no. You know, it was one of those death marriages-- you know, the kind where you have to start making dates to have sex. Well, I'm sure it'll work out. I mean, I'm sure you'll meet somebody else... and you'll be happy and you'll fall in love again... - and things'll just be wonderful. - Yeah, I don't know. I think it might be easier at this point... just to find an intelligent man to impregnate me. I'm sorry. I don't understand exactly who you are. Oh, didn't I tell you? She's-She's doing the study. I'm gonna be coming along to San Diego next week... to document the reunion. In fact, Nancy, I've got some waivers that I need you to sign. You see, there's such a dearth of in-depth documentation... into the psychological impact that these reunions have... on, for instance, you, the spouse, as well as Mel's adoptive family. - Ah, so you're a psychologist? - Not quite. I'm just finishing my doctorate. Tina used to be a dancer. Oh, those days are long gone. I-- Listen, I've gotta call the office. Oh, there's a phone in the kitchen. It's right there on your left. - Got one right here. - Well, next week? - Yeah, yeah. - God, that's soon. Well, they're gonna pay for everything. Isn't that great, sweetie? Honey? After I had my baby, I wanted my husband to stay home... and help with night feedings... not drag me on some plane for San Diego. I like travelling. The baby's five months old. I really think this is gonna get us closer together. Oh, honey, after you're married, he feels like he's kissing his mother half the time, anyway. Our kissing is still nice, but he's so controlling about the oral sex. Well, have you tried the warm water method? - Are you kidding? - No. - You're kidding. - No.Joe loves it. - Hey. - Oh, hi, Mel. - Hi. - Look what I found. What did you find? - What made you dig these out? - Remember? I don't know. I was just feeling nostalgic for some reason. That's so sweet. We found these on our first field trip together. Very sweet. Oh, congratulations on finding your mother, Mel. - Thank you. - That oughta settle some big issues for you, huh? Definitely. Which issues are you talking about? - Starting with the whole sex thing. - Sex. Baby's name. The baby's name. - 'Cause you said Ethan-- - No, no, wait a minute. She just said the sex thing. - You said that Ethan was too feminine. - Right. - We were trying to think of a more masculine baby name, right? So-- - Okay, but she said the sex thing. - Didn't you just say the sex thing? - But she meant that. - Well, why don't you just let her speak for herself? Wh-What did you mean? - Well, tell him. Tell him. Go on. Actually, it was oral sex I was referring to. Oral sex, really? I think I just walked in... - on a ladies' conversation that guys aren't supposed to-- - No, you didn't. - Yes, I-- I'm gonna go. - No, no, no, no, no. - I'm gonna leave. - No, stay. - No. No. Leave. - Don't go. Come on. - Go. Stay? No. - Honey, we weren't talking about us. - I-- What? - We wouldn't-- I wouldn't-- - No. I know. - You've gotta know that. - I know that so much. - Bye. - So true. Hey, I didn't go around telling my friends you didn't want to make love... for almost two months after the baby was born, did I? - Probably. - Okay, but it didn't get back to you, did it? Huh? Are you sure you're okay about this woman coming along? It's not weird or anything? Well, it's a little strange to be travelling with a chaperone. But if you're okay with it, I'm okay with it. Well, it's just, she's been through the process so many times. I think it's a good thing. Honey, if this helps you get what you need inside... - then I'm all for it. - Thanks, sweetie. This cheese is disgusting. Get it away from me. - What's wrong with this cheese? - It smells like vomit. - Oh, stop being such a baby. - Mom, Dad, this is Tina. - I'm a baby who smells like vomit? - Yes. - You okay? - Nancy, did you get that support bra yet? - Not yet. - What are you waiting for? - Hey, I want to introduce you to somebody. Please don't make such a big deal out of it. - It makes a real difference. - All right, could we not talk about this right now? Uh, yes, we're gonna talk about this because she's not listening to me. - I want you to see something. - Ohh. - Very nice, Pearl. - For God's sake. - I want you to consider my age and ask yourself how I maintain this. - Mom, why are you doing this? - How? I don't know. How? - This is it. All right, can we not deal with this right now, please? - I couldn't have a baby. But I had to fight the laws of gravity just the same... and you need the help of a good bra. And believe you me, if you want to keep your husband's attention, you'll get one pronto. You know, if my breasts drop, they drop, and there's nothing I can do about that. - Wrong! - That's right. Good for you, honey. - Wrong! -Just back off, will ya? - You've had five of these. - I don't think-- - Don't monitor me. - Your new friend is, uh, very long-waisted, isn't she? - Okay, that's it! - We're not talking about this any more, okay? - It's a free country. - Why can't I talk? - Let him alone. You're making an ass out of yourself again! - Why don't you leave me alone! Why don't you just have a little sniff? - Don't do that. Hey, hey. - The baby's crying. - Get that away from me, or I'll smack it off. - Yeah, you're gonna beat me up in front of all these people? - Don't tempt me! Would you stop acting like this? That's it! All right? - Don't yell in front of the baby. - Don't yell in front of the baby. It's not good. Well, he wouldn't have to yell if you'd listen to him for two seconds! Well, what's gotten into my sweet daughter-in-law all of a sudden? - Hormones. No mystery there. - Does this baby have a name yet? - Four months old, doesn't have a name. - Well, don't blame me. - I like the name Ethan. - Oh, no, no. Ethan's too lame. - Everything's too lame, too bold. - This is becoming an embarrassing, neurotic thing, Mel. It's not an embarrassing, neurotic thing. This is about my real identity. - It's about my background, okay? - Don't be ridiculous. You're Mel Coplin. That's who you are. You know, this process will go a long way towards clarifying that identity issue. What process? Who is this new friend with the camera already? I've only been trying to introduce you to her for the last ten minutes. - Her name is Tina Kalb, and she's here for a very important reason. - You're getting a divorce. -She's a counsellor. No, she's a lawyer. -Would you-- Would you just zip it? - Don't talk to your mother like that. - We're not getting a divorce. Maybe you should if you can't name the baby. - That is a terrible, sick thing to say, Ed! - You said it first! - That's no excuse! - If you say it, fine. If I say it, I'm sick. - Maybe. - Tina is with the adoption agency. - What adoption agency? - The adoption agency where you adopted me. - When I was a little baby, remember? - Oh, my God! Oh, God. I have to have a cigarette if we're gonna talk about this. - Can I bum one of those? - No, you can't smoke around the baby. - Show a little compassion, will you? - This might be a good time to make an exception. For her. - Pearl! - I'd like to know what happened to the Constitution in this country. - Please, can you please put it out? - Oh, all right, all right! Why does he have to do this roots thing? Aren't we good enough parents? I think you probably did the best that you could, but psychic scars can't be helped. Psychic scars? What is she talking about? She's saying we failed completely. - That's way too extreme. - Yeah, maybe just 40 percent. Mom, you can't quantify it like that. I mean, what difference does it make... if it's 40 percent or 60 percent? Sixty percent? Why is everybody getting so serious all of a sudden? I thought we were gonna talk about buying new carpeting... getting rid of this crap, putting in the wall-to-wall. Life is so rich, so full. You have a wife, a child, a good job. Why are you doing this? If I could pop in here for a second, I think that what Mel is trying to communicate here... is that no matter where we are in our lives, especially if we're adopted... we can't help but feel that there's something missing-- that there's something out there that's going to make us feel... complete, give us a sense of belonging, connectedness if you will. This woman strikes me as being very dangerous. It's understandable that you would find me threatening. Why don't you psychoanalyze me? I'd love to hear this. Go ahead. I'm, uh, abrasive, pushy, defensive. My husband is, uh, food-phobic, passive-aggressive. - Huh? Come on. Come on. - Look, the point is, we're going to San Diego in the morning, and-- What about your father's 60th birthday? Well, if you'd let me finish what I'm saying, I'd say that we have every intention of coming back for it. You are aware that they have a very big car theft problem in San Diego. - No, I wasn't aware of that. - Oh, yes, very big. I hadn't heard anything about that either. They bump you, and when you stop... they mutilate you and then take your car. - It happened to Art Sackhein. - What? - They killed Art Sackhein? - Oh, don't be ridiculous. They bumped him and took his car. Nobody said anything about killing. - You said mutilate. - Anyway-- - Please. Enjoy yourself. I understand they have a lovely zoo in San Diego. - Are you ready for San Diego? - Yeah! - Yes. - God, you look beautiful. - So do you. Oh, thanks. You know, maybe I'll just-- I'll run upstairs really quickly and change, 'cause I don't think-- - Don't be silly. You look adorable. - You look so elegant. - Honey. - I love that print. Come on. - Honey, you look great. Come on. Do you have the keys? I left with the feeling this road was endless Now it seems there's three days to heaven, it's okay 'Cause these wheels are takin'me home again It's all right I've got three days to heaven then I'm gonna make you mine Boy, it's beautiful, here, isn't it? Sweetie, I'm so happy we're doing this together. - Watch the road, please. - Me too. - How's the baby's diaper? - He's fine. - Good. - What's that? Oh, my God. It's happening. Shit! - Oh, God, no. - What's happening? It's the bump and rob. This is it. - Get down! - What? What? - Get down with the baby! - He's gaining on us! - Yo, slow down! - Back off, Jack! - Pull over! - How do you close this window? - Wait. I've got some Mace in my bag. - Damn it. - It's not working! - Listen to what he has to say. - Here it is. - Mace him! - Yeah, get him! - No! Fucker! You left your jacket in the parking lot. Asshole! Thank you for the jacket. Sorry about the Mace. Very sorry, sir. ''The Trinity Church Ministry of Hope.'' Oh, my God! They bump you, and when you stop... they mutilate you and take your car. - I don't think it's funny at all. I mean, his father created this fear-- - It is too funny. - It's funny. - Would you two, both of you, just stop, please? - And then-- - We're almost there. - I'm getting nervous. - Really, I'm not surprised at his reaction or by my reaction. - Okay, just breathe. - Ohh. - Should I ring the doorbell? - Okay. - I mean, no. Wait, wait, wait. I told you to wait. - You said yes first. - You didn't give me a chance to say no. - Well, I would've, but-- - Hi! - Hi. - Hi. Oh, what a pretty wife you have! And I see you've brought your nanny. - Oh, I'm not the nanny. I'm the wife. - Oh, excuse me. - What a terrible way to start. - Oh, don't be silly. I'm Tina Kalb from the Maidstone Adoption Agency. - Right. - Hi. - Hi. - Valerie Swaney. - Mel Coplin. - This is great. I love the stained glass. - Lovely. - Thank you. - Oh! - Now, he was a great president. You know, I always felt like I should've appreciated him more. I know just what you mean. Come on, let's get something to drink. Your daddy was short. That would explain it. And we have the same forehead, don't we? And the same eyes. Oh. This is amazing. I never shared physical traits with family before. I'm a bad person for what I did to you. - No, don't say that. - It's true. Look, Tina says that most women who gave up their children for adoption in the '60s... were independent young women acting against a conservative world. - You're sayin' I was a slut? - No. - Oh, God! - I didn't think-- You're not a slut. I was tall, and I developed earlier-- If that's a crime, go ahead and sue me, but I am not from trashy people. - Really, I wasn't suggesting that at all. - Your daddy was poor. He worked in my father's liquor warehouse in Baton Rouge. - Really? Baton Rouge. - That's where you were conceived. In the liquor warehouse on the cement floor... - Wow! - in Baton Rouge. Oh, my parents hated Lars. - Lars Waara was his name. - Waara? Lars Waara! - What kind of name is that? - Finnish. - Finnish? I'm Finnish. - I knew that. I mean, look at your face. Absolutely. Finnish-American. Half Scottish-American. Scottish-Finnish. What is that? I don't know how to do that. That's-- I'm gonna help. I'm gonna help you with that. This belonged to my great-great-grandmama who was of the Clan Bucanon... - Wow! - married to the Confederate General Beauregard. - I want you to have it. - A Confederate general? Mm-hmm. Expert boxer and marksman. - Really? Wow! - Wow! - What an athletic family, huh? - I was on two championship basketball teams myself. - I'm not athletic at all. - Look at this picture. This is-- Let's name the baby Beauregard, huh? - Beauregard? - Beau. Beau Coplin. - Beau? - I'm so touched. - Beau Coplin. Ah, yeah! - Oh, damn it! - What? - The camera just jammed. - You didn't get that just now? - No, and that was a terrific moment. - Let me see. - Forget the camera. - No, I can't. - No, forget-- That's-- Forget about it. - What? Don't you want to get it on tape? - I'd like to have it on tape. - I know. I'm sorry. - Uh, the light's better in the living room. - Look, honey, I'll be right back, okay? - I-I don't know what happened. - He's a very decisive man, isn't he? - Well, actually he's not. But today, for some reason-- Do you see that, that wheel in there? There's like a glob of gunk. - Yeah, I do. - Tar. - We need something to wipe it off with. - If we could get like a-- - What? You know what? I don't-- Let's just use my skirt. - Your skirt? - I don't care about it. It's old. - Really? Okay. -Just hold this, okay? - Okay. Here. -Just-- If you can-- - Hold still. - Yeah. Okay. I'm Beauregard from Dixie, hooray-- Technically, he's from New York. Right? - I'm sorry. Oh. I'm sorry. - Well-- - Uh, you got it, though. You got it. - Good. - Yeah. So how long did you say you were a dancer for? - Oh, God, don't remind me. - I haven't been to the gym in months. - Well, you don't seem like you need to go to the gym. - I mean-- - Well, you're very generous. - Yeah. - But when I was dancing, you know, my calves did not look like this. - Those look like very strong calves to me. - Well, strong, yeah. They've always been strong. When I was a kid, you know... I used to beat my brothers at Indian wrestling all the time. Away down south in Dixie He's a little cracker. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not a cracker. - You can't deny-- - I'm not a cracker! - Ohh. You feel it in your legs? It's really more about upper-body strength, isn't it? - No, it's all in the legs. - How? You'll see when you lose your balance. - Oh! - What in the world? Oh, my Lord! My Chinese zodiac is ruined! - I am so sorry. I really feel badly. - Oh, my goodness. My animals. - What else happened? - We were just in here, and then, um, freak accident. - I'm so sorry. - Yeah.Just-- - The shelf-- - What happened to the tail of my rooster? - You mean-- Is this it, maybe? - No. - That's the dog's pillow. Oh. Well, don't throw it! I want to pay for all this. Can I do that, please? - Absolutely not. - Why not? All children break things, and all children are forgiven. Now, you have never had that opportunity with me. Let's take this as a gift from God. And look, here's another gift from God. Ohhh, well, why is that a gift from God? The rabbit is still in one piece, and both you and your daddy were Year of the Rabbit. I always thought it was Year of the Dragon, at least in all those Chinese restaurant place mats. No, no, no. Lars is 1939. You're 1963. - Those are both rabbit years. - Actually, I was born in '65. - Don't you think I know when my own son was born? - 'Course you do, Valerie. Wait, that would make me two years older than I thought I was. Wow! - How? How is that? - You know what? I can clear this up with one phone call to the office. - Yeah, why don't you make sure? This really-- It kind of freaks me out. - Mom, why are those cars here? - Hey, girls, look who's here! - What happened to your glass animals? Oh, these are my twins from my third marriage. - This is Jane, and this is Sandra. - Hello. - This is your half brother, Mel. - He looks just like Uncle Freddie. - Oh, man! - Look at his nose. - What's so funny? - What's so funny? - He looks just like Uncle Freddie. Yes, he does. Why didn't I see that? Oh, Uncle Freddie. I'm flattered. What's he like? He's really sweet-natured. He's just that weird thing. What do you call it? - ''Frateurist.'' - Yeah, he's a frateurist. - Frateurist? What's that? - You rub up against people in crowded public places. - That's how I met Mel. - Seriously? - No, she's kidding. - This is not something to kid about. - Yeah. He went to jail for it. - Oh. - Can he come to the beach? - Oh, honey, I don't think he's got time for that, Jane. - Why not? - We're in the volleyball finals. - He can wear one of my shirts. - Oh, yeah, give him a shirt. - We'll go down to the beach. This is-- - You girls! - We're in the championship. - Oh, man, you should've been there yesterday. - Wow. Uh-huh. - It was so amazing. - It was match point. - Match point. - I went up for the spike. - She went up for the spike. - Shut up. Let me talk. - So I went up for the spike. - It was so intense. She went up for the spike-- - Shut up! - Girls, girls, calm down! - Listen, I, I, I don't believe this... but there's been a terrible, terrible mistake. And Valerie's not your mother, Mel. - What? - What are you talking about? Of course she's my mother. - We have the same forehead. - And he looks like Uncle Freddie. - Yeah, I look like Uncle Freddie. Please, just don't make this any harder on yourself than it already is. - Are you positive? - Yes. - He's not our brother? How could you make a mistake like that? I-- Well, our computer files were in transition... and Valerie's son is named Martin Coplin... - and he lives in Orlando, Florida-- - What? My son? Who is this man? Not your son. Mel, your father is named, uh... Fritz Boudreau, and he lives in Gundall, Michigan. - So I was thinking, maybe on our way to New York, we could stop off or-- - Who are these people in my home? -I feel like a complete idiot. I'm so-- -Well, I take these people into my home. - I know. - We fly all the way out here, we have this big, tearful reunion-- - Their child is here. Yeah, well, get it out, Nancy. It's gonna make us all feel a lot better. - Are you humouring me? - No, I am not humouring you. - I don't think this is funny. - I'm very serious. I certainly don't-- - Excuse-- No, excuse me! I expect you to pay for this damage. Well, w-wait a minute. You said it was a gift from God. Remember? That's when you were my son. - Well, don't you have insurance or something? - And raise my premiums? No, thank you. May I have my pendant back, please? - Can we have our shirt back? - We'd let you keep it. It's just that we don't have very many of them. - Yeah. There's only, like, ten left. - Yeah. No, sure. - I'm sorry. - Sorry. - I understand. - Thanks. - Have a nice life. - Yeah, good luck with this whole family thing, you know. - Thank you. - I hope it works out for you. You have my other knee pad? How could you be related? How? She is a six-foot blonde descendant from the clan Bucanon. We were only trying to be open to them. Well, we could be open with them, but we don't have to become them. I thought she was my mother. Come on, give me a break. How did you happen to knock down those glass shelves, anyway? I don't know. I just-- You know, we were trying to fix the camera, and we bumped into them. It's strange you would just happen to bump into them. Well, we were also Indian wrestling. Indian wrestling? What is that? It's just this game that kids play. It's a very innocent little kids' game. Why were you playing that? Because we were talking about athleticism in Tina's family... and then how Valerie's family was athletic also, and-- I don't know. - You're attracted to her, aren't you? - No. That's okay. She's attractive. Yeah, she's attractive, but I'm, I'm married to you. You know, she may be attractive, but she's got a screw loose. Yes, I agree with you. She's very eccentric. But I'm definitely-- I'm in love with you, honey. Honey? The revolution came and left today Nobody knew it came and went And so did Judgement Day In somebody else's body With someone else's head In somebody else's body When I was someone else instead In somebody else's body With someone else's head When you're in somebody else's body - In someone else's bed - Hey, I think this is the place. - This looks muy macho, doesn't it? - Creepy to me. Oh, no, look. Somebody's coming out, Mel. Hey! Hi! - Excuse me. Is one of you fellows Fritz Boudreau? - Hey! - Did I invite you onto my property? - Hey, take it easy! Take it easy! - Tina, don't go over there! - Hey! Oh, my God! Would you let me explain? We can talk about-- - Fuck! Run! - What's happening? Fuck! The car's this way! Would you stay away! Son of a bitch! - Doesn't he want to see me? - Well, I felt so bad about San Diego, I bent the rules a little bit. - Did you-- Did he-- Did you call them? - Yes, I tried to! - His phone isn't working. - What the fuck you people talking about? We just wanted to know if one of you is Fritz Boudreau, because they said he was my father. What did they say? Who said I'm your father? - She did. - The Maidstone Adoption Agency. Why, you little shit! Look at this turd face, Mitch! This turd is my son. I'm sorry, man. Did we scare you? - Yeah, a little. - A little bit. - We were scared too. How did we know? I dropped a lot of baby batter in my day. - This is the first son I ever met. - Wow. - What a wonderful moment. - I wish I had my camera. - You picked a hell of a time to drop by, turd face. - Well, your phone wasn't working. - Nah, I don't need no son to give me no guilt trip about a phone. Fritzie, Fritzie, we gotta get goin', pal. - Remember? - Shit. - What? - Come on. - Goin' somewhere? - Yeah. - Where do you have to go? - We gotta get the wheels balanced for a big trip tomorrow. - Where you goin'? - After Eugene balances the wheels... - we're gonna be out for about three weeks. - Three weeks? Really? - Damn. - Bad timing. - Why don't we bring 'em along? Huh? You know, it's only - Yeah. Come on with us. - What? In the truck? - Hey, you ever been in a truck before? - No, not really. How do you like this? First time in a rig, huh? - It's great. - It's really fabulous, Mr Boudreau. Some people look down on drivers, like we're low class. Not me. I always wanted to learn how to drive a big rig. - You never told me that. - Well, I might not have voiced it until now... -but it's always been a fantasy of mine. -You want a lesson? - You'd give me a lesson? - Sure! Why not? Let's not do this while the baby's in the truck. - Don't you trust me? - Of course I trust you. - But he's never done this before. - She's not gonna let you drive the truck, so forget about it. - Are you sayin' my son's a bitch boy? - I didn't say that! - What's your name again? - Mel. You ain't no bitch boy, are ya, Mel? No, I don't believe I'm a bitch boy. Don't let him bait you into doing something stupid, Mel. Nancy, Mel needs your support now. - Yeah, I need your support, honey. - Yeah. - I support you, Mel. - Me too! I wanna get out. You're acting like a real asshole. Pussy-whipped. We're comin' back in 15 minutes. What's the big deal? Hey! Get away! Have a great trip, okay? - We'll be supporting you from out here. May I have my baby, please? - Nancy. Just send us a postcard, 'cause we'll be right here at the Gundall Post Office, okay? This isn't gonna take long, honey. Just calm down. So remember, it's like a butterfly's wings. Use a little gas, a little clutch. - A little gas, a little clutch. - A little gas, a little clutch. What happens if I hit this? - What does that do? Is that okay? - You know somethin'? You got a-- You got a kind of Jew look, don't you? Well, the people who raised me are Jewish. Maybe that's what you're picking up on. They-They gave you a real ''Hebe'' look, kid. - Mitch, don't say that. That's not nice. - Wait a second. Wait-- No, it's not a Jew face. It's-- It's a face like Old Needledick's! Yeah! You're not in some kind of science, are you, kid? Science? Actually, I'm an entomologist. -Entomologist sounds like science to me. -Wait, wait, wait. Who's-Who's Old Needledick? What are you talking about? When I met your mother, I was ridin' with the Angels in Oakland, Cal. - Uh-huh. The Hell's Angels? Uh-huh. - Yeah. And we got invited to all these fancy parties... because rich people liked to hang around with the Angels... and musical bands and whatnot. And your mother meets this guy, Richard Schlich-- - I can never pronounce that cocksucker's name. - Schlichling. Okay, okay. So she meets this guy, Richard Schlich-- Schlichling. -And what? What? They went off together? -They ran off together... to Antelope Wells. - You're saying-- - This can't be happening. You're saying you're not sure if you're my father? - I'm sorry to disappoint you. - But the records show... that-that you're the one who brought him into the agency. I did a good deed as a favour, because his mother and father were indisposed. - Indisposed how? - You'll have to ask your mother about that. But we don't know where she is. So isn't it possible... that you got her pregnant before she left you? - No, no, no! With this face, this science thing-- - Hey, we're movin' backwards here. - Where's the brake? Do I-- - Put it in first. Oh, my God! Mel! I don't think it's wrong to want to take a driving lesson with your father, right? - I'm not speaking to you. - Sweetie, I'm sorry about this. Give me a kiss. Sweetie, give me-- - Hey, Mr Boudreau, where is Antelope Wells? - Please step off. - Sorry, do you know where Antelope Wells is? - I have no idea.Just-- She doesn't know what the hell she's doing. That man was a lunatic, a stranger! - Okay, okay. - Mr Boudreau, please, before you go... - Tommy, get her off me! Move! -just tell me where Antelope Wells is. - When I say step off, I mean step off! - Hey! I am from New York, okay? On the upside, Antelope Wells should be warmer than this place. So we're just gonna jump on a plane to New Mexico? Is that it? Well, I think that we should finish what we started. Agent Paul Harmon, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. This is Agent Tony Kent. Now let's see. You, uh, you thought this Fritz Boudreau was your father, but, in fact, he's not your father. - Well, no, I-- - Tony. Tony Kent. - Nancy Curwin. - This is unbelievable! We went to high school together in Chicago. - You look fantastic! - Now-- - No! - God! - What are you doing in this police job? Oh, I need a health plan while I'm writing my first book. What are you doing now? - I'm curating. - Excuse me. Excuse me. There's something here we gotta take care of. - Okay? - I'm sorry, Paul. Go ahead. You do know it's a Federal offence to destroy a United States post office. Well, it wasn't like it was some premeditated act of terrorism. - You know what I mean? - I'll be the judge of that. Now, the ostensible purpose for this truck ride was what exactly? He was giving me a lesson. It was very simple. - He just wanted to teach me how to drive the truck. - This baby is beautiful. - Thanks. - Oh, gorgeous blue eyes. - Tony, Tony, Tony. - You know, he looks a lot like you. - Tony. Tony. - Thank you. -Just-- In a minute. - Give the baby back. - Hey, feel his little grip. It's so strong. - Feel it. -Jesus Christ! - Hey. - I'm s-- I'm-- - You're under way too much stress. - Listen, this man drove a semi into a Federal building. You were gonna give him a warning. It's an accident, remember. - There's certain procedures that you have to follow. - Right. He's got a valid licence. - Not to drive a truck! He does not! - It was the trucker's fault... - for letting him drive in the first place. - All right, okay. Can I talk with you in private? This is my investigation. - I just said you didn't have to suspend his licence. - Here, I'll take the baby. - You gotta start taking the job-- - So what's the deal with this guy, huh? - We went to high school together. - You just went to high school together? - Mm-hmm. - Did you know him well, or is it-- - He was on the football team. - Oh, the football team. Oh. - It's not a murder. It's-It's not a bank robbery. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. -Just cut the baby crap. - Oh, all right. I'm sorry. So it looks like this Boudreau fellow... is gonna take the rap for you driving the truck, so... I'm just gonna give you a warning. But I'm-- If you-- If you drive a truck again, they're gonna take your licence away for sure. - Okay. - You understand? Yes, I understand. Thank you. - Is that it? Are we free to go now? - You are free to go, yes. - Great. Let's get out of here. - Uh, hey, do you guys have a place to stay tonight? - Probably check into a motel. - No, don't do that. - There's so many wonderful B-and-B's right here in Lake Michigan. - Oh, I hate B-and-B's. -Why do you hate B-and-B's? -Well, first of all, there's no privacy. - No privacy. Uh-huh. - Yeah. And you have to, you have to make chitchat... - with the boring old lady who runs the place-- - That's kind of the fun, isn't it? Yeah, there's always the little cat, little cat-- You have to pretend like you like the cat. Yeah, well, whatever we do, we need to eat first, 'cause I'm starving. - Why don't we take you out to dinner? - Are we apologizing for the arrest? No, but it would be nice to catch up with Nancy. - We could take them to Minetti's. - Minetti's is great... - but you're not gonna get a reservation this time of night at Minetti's. - You know what? Thanks. Thanks anyway. - But we'll be fine, really. - See? We don't want to intrude, Tony. No, no, no, no, no. Don't be silly. We're getting sick of each other's company anyways. - Oh. - You see? I told you. - Hey, stop that! - I can't believe you're a writer now. Well, an aspiring writer. I'm trying to get this whole book together, this crime fiction thing. You were such a jock in high school. You were so wild. I know. And you were such an egghead, remember? - No. - You were an egghead. - No! - So what I'm asking is, you fly into Albuquerque and then rent a car... - We're going to Texas tomorrow. - and how far-- - It's way down. Way down at the southeastern corner of the state. - Wait. Excuse me. Have you been there before? - It's almost in Mexico, in fact. I've been near there. - Antelope Wells is right near the White Sands National Monument. - Uh-huh. They've got this fantastic, uh, hot springs nearby that not many people know about. Oh, I wish you could come along and show me around while Mel meets his family. - You have the personal days. You should do it, Paul. - I can't take time off work right now. - Unbelievable line at the bathroom! - I told 'em they gotta get a bigger bathroom. Look at him. He loves you. You're wonderful with children. Oh, I want one of these so badly. I'm telling you. Hey, could you help me out with an adoption, Tina? Well, that depends on the specifics of your situation. - Well, like what? - Number one: Are you married? - Yes. - Number two: Does your spouse work? - Yeah. - And is she willing to adopt? - You see, that's where the snag is. Then you've got a real problem. What would my chances be as a single parent? - Excuse me, please. - Why can't you stay and discuss this? - 'Cause I believe in privacy, that's why. - Right. We have nothing to be ashamed of, though. Because I don't want to share my personal life with everybody I meet, okay? She's not just anyone. She works in an adoption agency. I thought that she could be helpful. God! You know, I keep telling him that having a baby will reduce stress by taking his mind off work... but he just-- he doesn't listen, you know? So where did you folks come down on the big circumcision controversy? 'Cause, you know, there's a movement afoot these days to keep the foreskin... and, personally, I think a boy's penis should look just like his father's. - You know? - Yeah, mm-hmm. - Can I have the baby? Oh, sure. Yeah. Here we go. Oh, so cute. My late husband devised his own anti-erosion system... that later on we had patented on the advice of a dear friend... who was in a law office with Gerald Ford. My brother has the same birthday as President Ford... who is a very sweet man. We met him twice. Once at a political rally and once at a golf tournament. And his wife is such a sweet lady. Betty Ford is so pretty. And why couldn't we go to a motel? Because at a motel we don't have the bonus... of someone related to Gerald Ford's birthday. We forgot your father's birthday. Oh, fuck. - Hello? - Hi, Mom. So, how's the psychic healing going? I am really sorry we didn't get back for Dad's birthday. It's all right. We'll try it again when he turns 65... provided he lives that long and you're not too busy. - I said I was sorry. - Why are you whispering? - Because I'm not supposed to be using this phone. - Are you all right? We're fine. It's just-- There was a big mix-up in San Diego... and then I ended up flattening a post office with a truck. - What truck? - Truck? What's happening with a truck? We had the wrong information. But we have the right information now, and we're going to New Mexico. - New Mexico? - Tell him they got uranium in the water down there. Shush. He's in some kind of trouble. - Did your car get bumped in San Diego? - No! I mean, yes, there was a minor incident. Nothing-- No, no! We don't do this here, unless it's an emergency. - What's the emergency? - Is it the baby? -Oh, my God! What's wrong with the baby? -The baby is fine. - Good. Then hang up. - Do you need help? - Things aren't-- - Do you see this sign? ''No phone calls after 8:00 p.m. - Use gas station at corner.'' - All right. Could I, could I just have 30 seconds, please? No. Do you want to pay my phone bills? - Thirty seconds. - Hang up! - Is that tyrant your mother? - No. I have to go, all right? - We're gonna be with the Schlichtings. - The ''Shitkings''? - What kind of a name is Shitking? - Schlichting. Schlichting. They're my parents. - What kind of a name is Shitking? - Verboten means verboten! - I don't know. I think it's German. We're gonna be in Antelope Wells. Hello? Mel? - I used my calling card. - That's not the point! I think something terrible is happening to him. - Calm down, calm down. - I can't calm down! - What did he say? - We have to do something. - All right, well, we'll call back. - We can't call back. He's on his way to New Mexico, for God's sake! Who knows what kind of people he's with? Anything is possible. Don't say that! You're starting to scare me. - I am not. You were already scared. - I was not! - Yes, you were. - Eddie, we have to do something! Like what? There's nothing we can do. - The kitchen's off-limits after 8:00. - What are you, her spy? - Why didn't you use Tina's phone? - 'Cause Tina's phone isn't working. You know, it's starting to feel like this whole thing is a big waste of time. - You're feeling frustrated. - Yes, I'm feeling very frustrated. I was worried your expectations were too high for all of this. - You know, maybe we should just forget everything and go home. - Don't do that. You always get so pessimistic when you're close to finishing something you've started. - I do not. - Yes, you do. You did it with the apartment. You loved it so much. The day we go to sign the lease, you start freaking out. And the wedding. How many times did you change the date? You're right. You're right. I do this all the time. So stick to your plan for once, okay? If you want to find your parents, find your parents. - Oh! - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Are you okay? You seem upset. - I owe you a big apology. I mean, this was-- this is not the way I planned this trip, not the way I wanted it to turn out. Look, look, it's been kind of difficult, but I think we've gotten past the bumps. You know, I feel, I feel really good about, about where we're going. I really think it's gonna be great. You're such an optimist. Where does that come from? Well, you know, I've always said it's a mistake to let pessimism take over... right before you're about to finish something. That's the complete opposite of my ex-husband. He was such a pessimistic pig. Well, I think you're doing a great job. Really. - Really. - Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Thanks. Shit. What was that noise? Did you drop something? Goddam cat flew out of nowhere. Scared the hell out of me. - What are you doing? - Huh? - Where'd you get the pup tent? - I-- I'm feeling very sexual. I don't know. I'm just feeling like I want to-- Wait. Let me just take my glasses off. Wait a second. Wait, Mel! Mel, look at me. Just slow down for a second. Let's take our time. - Look at me. - Huh? Why? - Why aren't you looking at me? - What? What? I'm looking at you! - Why do I have to look at you? I mean-- - Well, why can't you look at me? I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I mean, don't you ever think that maybe it's not natural... for two people to be together their entire lives? - Do you ever think that? - Oh, I get it. Your parents weren't good enough for you... and now I'm not good enough for you because Tina's a skinny dancer, right? - No. What? - You know, it takes some women... more than a year to get back to their normal weight after having a baby. - You are not good B-and-B people! - Yeah, well, that's because we hate B-and-B's! - Thanks. - Look, we need to talk. - Okay. - I'm, I'm not sure I'm ready for an affair with a married man right now. I'm feeling just as confused as you are, okay? About the whole thing, all right? I'm in the middle of a divorce. I'm going to school at night. You know, I need to be taken seriously as a woman. I want to have my own children. I want to have my own life, you know? Not just some sort of vicarious semblance of like somebody else's life. Shit. - What's the matter with her? - Hi. She's upset about the way everything's going. She's really-- Yeah. Listen, I feel like I owe you an apology about last night. - Okay. - Well, I mean, I think we should discuss it... - because, you know, there's two sides to everything. - Hey, you guys! That doesn't sound like an apology. What the hell? - Hey! - Hello again, strangers. - Hey. Hi. - I'm sorry that I stormed out like that last night. But I suffer from hypertension. You probably already knew that. The whole thing was a blessing, really, because it finally made Paul realize how much he needs some R-and-R. - Sometimes you gotta be zonked on the head. What can I say? - Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You guys are going to New Mexico? - We're goin', yeah. Nothing like a cruel acceptance of a casual invitation, right? - Invitation? What invitation? - I think you were in the bathroom. - Oops. Did we jump the gun here? - No, this'll be fine. No, wait. What do you mean it's fine? It's fine? - We're sightseeing. We're not gonna get in your way. - I'm glad to have the company. - It's gonna be fun. - Look, we already checked in. Why don't I find a row for the baby, okay? - Terrific! - Okay. Bye-bye. - Thanks. - Bye. - We'll see you on board, Mel. I'm sorry about that. I didn't expect them to show up, honey. - So what? You just had a little extra hostility to work out? - It isn't hostility. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - I just barely mentioned it to them. - Right, great, great. - Right? - Great, great. - Right? - Whatever, okay? I wasn't circumcised until I was a year old. - Wow! Why? - I had hypospadias. - What is that? - Here you are, sir. - Well, hypospadias is like a curvature of the penis that-- - They have to adjust it with a whole operation. - Really? - Yeah. I had it done when I was young. I mean, it's fine now. - Oh, wow. - Here you go. Honey? - What? - Why don't you cover yourself, hmm? I just finished nursing him, okay? Ever heard of hypospadias? Is there something wrong with the plane? - How, how is the nipple irritation? - It's really bad, actually. You know why? 'Cause I, I was watching you... and I think you might be holding him at the wrong angle. Hey, I meant-- - I've been doing this for a while now. - Oh, I know you have. But, but, you see, when he's under, when he's under your breast like this... - Mm-hmm. - and, see, he pulls down on the nipple which obviously causes more irritation. - But if you're out here and bring him straight into the breasts-- - Uh-huh. - You know? I mean-- - How'd you get to be such an expert on all this? - I went out with a woman who was a midwife. - Really? - Yeah. You have very beautiful breasts, by the way. - Thank you. I re-- I remember them from high school. - Do you? - Yeah. No, not that I was like looking at them... but, I mean, I just saw them in passing. - Hey, Paul? - Yes, here. - Do you mind finding another seat? - I won't look. - No, no, no, no. We need it for the baby to stretch out. - It would really help us out. - Oh. Another seat, huh? - Yeah. - Oh, ok-- Yeah. - Yeah? Great. - Thanks a million. Thanks. - No, that's-- - Okay. - Thanks. - All right. - Hey, thanks for the water. - Yeah. - That's the headache pressure point. - Mmm. - Can you feel it? - Yeah. Is there something happening here that I haven't been clued into yet? Paul, would you mind finding another seat? This is wonderful. This is great. I just-- I can't believe how naive I am. Sir, I can't have you moving around. Please sit in your assigned seat, okay? Okay, okay. Is anybody sitting here? Does anybody actually own a white Taurus, or are they all just rentals? Are you kidding me? This is the most reliable mid-size in America, according to all the big reports. I'm feeling very depressed, and I would like to talk about what's happening here. - What are you feeling depressed about? - I feel like there's an agenda and it's not what I had in mind. - What agenda? - Well, do I have to spell it out? I'm the fifth wheel here. - How do you think that makes me feel? - We're riding in two cars until we get to the B-and-B, Paul. - That's not an agenda. - Let's just hit the road, okay? You don't mind if he rides with you, right? - Why can't he ride with you? - See what you're doing to me? - Ride with us. I don't care. Ride with us. - Oh, that's so generous of you, Tony. You know, I think I'll ride with illicit couple number two. Oh, no. He does this to me every eight months. -I ought to get used to it by now, but-- -What? What does he do? He gets antsy and he runs off with somebody else. Well, I think that that's common, you know, among certain types of married men. I'm the rock, he's the flake. So that's life. That's exactly what my ex-husband used to say when he was trying to feel superior to me. - Tony's flights of terror from his own life... - Ex. have nothing to do with my superiority. - Well, it's not terror that makes people wander. - I know. - It's vitality. - I see. Is it vitality that led Mel to leave his wife for you? - Paul, would you mind riding in the other car? - I don't know. I don't mind. - Good. Could we just pull over here? - Yeah. I think-- So what happened in the other car anyway? Oh, Paul was probably lecturing them, right? No, I wasn't lecturing them. I was asking questions. That's all. I wasn't lecturing. Oh, my God. Is that-- You brought your gun. Absolutely I brought it. You never-- You get beeped for an emergency. You know, you're such a hopeless workaholic. We're on vacation, for God's sake. - Oh, yeah, such a good time. - No, Mel's like that too. He cannot enjoy anything. - You know, if you-- If you can't commit to our marriage now, what are you gonna do when we have a baby? Huh? Why can't he ride with you, huh? Hey, you invited them in the first place. - Could you pass me the Baby Wipes? - Where are you going? - To pee. - You're just gonna-- Right here? You're just gonna squat? - Why do you have to take your keys with you to pee anyway? - I just wasn't thinking, okay? It's-- I don't know how many times I've told you to keep your keys... - in one place. -Just shut up! Fuck. Nancy was saying you guys were having some tension around oral sex? - Oh, was she? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. Uh-- Hey. - Oh. - It happens to me too, but... you know, a technique that I find useful-- humming to myself. - Humming to yourself? - Yep, humming. - Really? - Seems to release the tension so I can enjoy the fellatio. It's great. - Great. Great. - Thank you. Thanks for the tip. - You bet. - All right. Do you worry about the risk factor involved in gay sex? You know, it may be news to you, but not every gay man has, uh, anal sex. That's where a lot of the HIV risk lies. For example, I'm very anal. Uh, I-- I mean, in, uh, in the sense... that I'm compulsively careful and clean about what touches my body. - Not into penetration, at all. - To a fault. - Okay, do we have to talk about this right now? - Well, why not? - Are you a homophobic? - No, I-- - I think it's interesting. - Really? Well, I think maybe-- maybe we shouldn't. - No, I think it's very-- Oh, God. - Well-- Uh, no-- Uh-- - Nancy's just testing the risk factor for sex with Tony, Mel. - How primeval. What? - Paul, don't patronize her. - I'm not patronizing her. She knows that I came of age in the era of AIDS... and even though I'm bisexual I've been incredibly careful, okay? - Tested negative three times in the last seven months. - Really? - If I remember correctly. Yeah, three times. - What does that mean? I'm sorry. Uh, maybe we should've sprung for an updated edition, huh? Hmm. I mean, uh, the picture's right here. It was a nice B-and-B. Yeah, they probably had something about the uranium contamination in the new edition. Yeah. Did it ever occur to you to call first? Or-- Without spontaneity, the world of B-and-B's is fairly meaningless. Oh. Well, then, I hope you have a tent because that's the only way that you can be spontaneous... in the middle of the desert at this hour. Maybe Mel's parents can suggest a place. Oh, right, I'm just going to, uh, show up with 50 people. ''Hi. I haven't seen you for about 30 years. This is my posse. And, by the way, Nancy invited along these two gay guys just for fun... and, you know, we're gonna be here for a while.'' Wh-Wh-What does gay guys have to do with anything? Nothing. It has nothing to do with anything, okay? I didn't mean to be insulting. Then why'd you say it, neurotic guy? - Th-That's my designation? I'm ''neurotic guy''? - Mm-hmm. - Uh-huh, uh-huh. - Yeah. - I don't think you know me well enough to call me ''neurotic guy.'' Oh, really? ''Gay guy'' isn't intimate? - Look, do you wanna file an anti-defamation suit... - There's no intimacy happening here. or do you want to get to the ''Schwingkings''' before midnight? Okay? Is this another surprise visit, or did you call first this time? - You know, I spoke with them already. I told you that, Nancy. - What? What? - What? - What, do you want to get intimate? Is that what you're saying? - Hey, the baby's going to sleep. - Huh? No? - You hear that? - Yeah. Yeah. - Lend me your comb It's time to go home Gotta confess My hair is a mess Your mama will scold you Your daddy will shout As we come in The way we went out Kissin'you was fun Honey bun Thanks for the date Time has come Honey, honey bun You know, baby, it's a-gettin'late Just wait till I Straighten my tie Lend me your comb We've got to go home - This is a long porch. - It's a beautiful house, though. - Sorry. - Do you think you can wait back in the car? - Gotta go to the bathroom. - Hi! - Hi! - It's so late. We were getting worried about you. - I hope my directions were all right. - Oh, they were great. This place is so isolated. - Oh, that's what we love about it too. - I'm Tina Kalb. We spoke on the phone. - Tina. - Oh, yeah, right. Hi. Oh. - We were shocked to get your call yesterday. - Yeah. I'm, I'm just amazed that you ran into Fritz Boudreau after all these years. - Nice to meet you. - He's something. - Yeah. Well, he never got over the fact that Mary left him for me. Which one of you is Mel? That's me. - Mary Schlichting. - Oh, so that's how you pronounce it. - Oh! - Nobody ever gets it right. Hi. - Hi. - And this must be your wife. - Nancy. - Nancy, hi. Welcome to our family. - Hi. Look at the baby. - Well, he's sleeping. - These are our friends. - Uh, Tony and Paul. - Tony. - Paul. Mr Schlichting. - Hello, uh, Paul. Hi. Hello. How you doing? - I'm Tony. They were going to stay at Rancho Arroyo. - Oh, my goodness. You can't stay there. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, no. They, they found that-- We read about that. - Uranium, yeah. - Uranium, yeah. - Yeah. - Highly toxic. Thank God that's far away from here. You don't have to worry about that. - Well, could you recommend a motel? - Oh, no! No, no, no. - Oh, no need to go to a motel. - There isn't a decent motel for a hundred miles. - And we have plenty of room here for all of you. - Oh, thank you. - Great. - Sure, sure. - I-I-I don't want everyone to stay here with you. It's-- - Why can't everyone stay here? - Because this is a private thing. - You know, if I could just lay down. I'd like to go right to bed and put the baby to sleep. Sure. Let me help you. Don't you want to eat something before you-- - No. Thanks. I'm not hungry. - Nancy, come on. You're always hungry. - Fuck you. - What? I'm, I'm sorry? It's just-- You know, this isn't the time or the place for this, okay? Oh, but it was the time and place to wrestle with her... in San Diego, right, and break a bunch of glass animals? That's i-- That's fine? That was a perfect time? -I'm sorry, is this inappropriate? -Nothing in this house is inappropriate. We'll be upstairs. You know, I-I'll get the, the bags. I think I want to lay down too. I bet you would. - Hmm. Hmm. - Having some problems, huh? Yeah, we're kind of having a little bit of a-- - Yeah. It's, uh-- - This, uh, some kind of a swapping thing you got here? - That what it is? - No. No, no, no, no.Just, you know, there's a little friction, that's all. - I mean, you know-- - And then, and, and these guys came along with us. - Well, you know, you know-- - You know, marriage is tough. You just got-- You gotta be flexible in marriage, right? - Yeah. Yeah. - This thing is wonderful, by the way. Who made this? - That's my work. - Really? You did this? Wow. - Yeah. - Yeah, I got a blacksmith shop out in the barn, and I do my sculptures there... - Oh. - and Mary throws her pots. - Great. - Really? She's into, into pottery? Pottery? - Oh, she's gonna love showing you her pottery. Yeah, look at this. - See, this, this is slab construction. If you can see the-- - Yeah. Uh, when I roll it out, then I have weeds in with the rolling pin. - I press them right into the surface. - You know, just ordinary weeds. - You put the weeds in the clay, yeah. And then when you fire it, the weed-- the weeds burn off. Here, just stick-- - See, so where the weeds were, you get the-- - Stick your fingers in here, you know. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah-- - Now, stick two fingers inside... - and just caress the-- That's it. Now-- - Oh, okay. There you go. Yeah. - Uh-huh. Now feel the texture on the out-- No, against your face. - Yeah, so it's much-- Up here. - That texture is-- - Oh, it's kind of-- Yeah, it's very rough. - That texture is really amazing. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's great. - It looks rough... - but it's very smooth, isn't it? - Doesn't that feel good? Isn't it something? - Right, right, it's smooth. - Smoother than you would think, but, but still, still really-- - Yeah. This is wonderful. Great stu-- I mean, and you guys, you guys are making a living through the arts, huh? - Well, we try. We-- Sometimes you have to supplement. - We try to, but, you know, sometimes-- - Yeah, you have to supplement with other things. - These are all mine. Every one of them, I made-- Oh, let-- I want to show you a big one I love. This environment is so much more creative than the one I grew up in. - Oh, thanks. That's nice. - It's really-- - This is a wood fire process. - Uh-huh. Uh, is this-- - See how this-- Hmm? - Who's that? - That's our other son. - You mean I have a brother? - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - You wanna say hello to Lonnie? - Yes. He's been feeling a little threatened about meeting you, so be patient. - Uh-huh. Hi. How you doing? That's a beautiful song you're playing there. - Is supper almost ready? Lonnie? - Yeah, we better-- We better go in and, and eat. He's been cooking all day. Bagged the quail himself this morning. Ooh, wild quail. That's terrific. Oh, you're in for a great treat. Lonnie's a really good cook. Ooh, the special son is here tonight Little Cinderella oughta cook up Something special for him Lonnie, can you make Your quail tonight Okay. You know-- You know what I want, I want to have happen? I want Mel-- I want you to sit over there next to your father. - Oh, it's okay. - Oh, it's no problem. Then I have all three of my fellows in a row. All right. Come on. Come on. Come around. - Um, maybe you should take your, your plate with you. - You don't mind, do you, Paul? - That's all right. I didn't touch it. Come on, come on. Sit down. You like quail? - See? - No, I never had quail. - Where are you? You all right? - I just don't wanna talk about it. I need to calm down. - All right. Well, if you do wanna talk about it, you know, I, I wanna be here for you. - Thank you. - Want me to take care of the baby? He's fine. He's sleeping. - Um, do you mind if I take a shower? - No, I don't care, but could I-- - Could I just have a second? - Okay. So, um, Fritz said you were a scientist, Richard. Yeah, I was a-- I was a chemist for Maple Brothers in the Bay Area before we came out here. - Right, the aspirin company. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Decongestants, nasal sprays, all that, uh, you know, that consumer crap. I couldn't wait to quit. - Oh, he hated it. - Mm-hmm. I'm a scientist too. - No, you're kidding! - Yeah. - Oh, you're kidding! - Oh, my God! What are you-- What's, what's your specialty? What, what's your field? - Entomology. - No! Isn't that incredible? - I love it. - Yeah. - A genetic connection! - Yeah. See, that is wonderful. - Oh, my God! That's incredible! - That is wonderful. - Oh, that's amazing. - For some reason, Lonnie never seemed to have an interest in science. - Mm, what does that mean? - Hey, she doesn't mean anything. It means something that you never had-- an interest in science. Look at the other things you do. Yeah, well, who knows? I might have had an interest in sculpture if these guys didn't give me away. - Yeah, who knows what might have happened? - Yeah, I know. - Give me a kiss. - Yeah, wh-wh-wh-what did happen? - About what? - Well, why did you guys give me up? Why did we give him away? - The big question. - That's the question. Well, Fritz Boudreau said that you were indisposed... and so that's how he came to bring Mel to the agency. - ''Indisposed''? Is that what he said? - Yeah, indisp-- - That's the word Fritz used? - That's-- That would have been nice. - Big word for the fellow, huh? - I wouldn't mind being indisposed. - Okay, I'm gonna tell the story. Um, how, how much detail do you have to go into here? I want Mel to know what happened, or he'll never believe we cared about him. - What are you hanging onto that for? - You're holding onto it. - I'm not holding onto anything. - I'm letting it go. - Uh, you're holding onto these things. Uh, tell him. Go ahead, tell him. I don't care. Go ahead. So, Mel, you know we were living in San Francisco, and it was the mid '60s, right? - Uh-huh, yeah. - And we were part of a very progressive group of artists... - and there was one band at the centre of it. - A band? Wh-Wh-What band? Jerry Garcia, blah, blah, blah. I am so sick of this fucking story! It's so boring! You've been telling it for years! Give it up! - He doesn't like it when I tell this story. - What happened with Jerry Garcia? - Nothing. - Nothing happened with Jerry Garcia, but Richard and I went to prison-- -Right-- Right after you were born. -And that's why we had to give you away. - You went to prison? - Oh, don't be stigmatized by it. - It wasn't a serious crime. - Oh, God, it was nothing. - Not even a crime. - It was absolutely nothing. - Next to nothing, really. - Less than nothing. Have you ever, you know, like, driven... a few miles over the speed limit, or something like that? - Yeah, sure. - It was less than that. If you speed, y-you know, you could hurt somebody. - This is-- - So, were you-- you were jailed for driving? - No, no, no. No, there was no driving. I tried-- - How did they get that? I'm, I'm, I'm, uh-- I'm sorry, I'm totally lost here. - Hi. - Hi. - Here, I'll get out of your way. Aah! - Ooh. - What are you doing? - Oh, I don't know. What did I do? - Oh, no, no. It's okay. Relax. Relax. - No, watch out. You-- - I-- You could hurt your fingers. - Watch how you-- - Whoops. - Sh-- - I'm so clumsy. - No, you're not. You know, I have these, uh, these, these-- - three Italian prints at home that I keep, uh-- - Mm-hmm. I don't know what to do-- if I should frame them myself... - or maybe I should take them to somebody else. - I, uh-- I would-- I would take them to the framer. - Yeah? - Yeah, well-- - So maybe that's what I'll do. I think that-- Yeah. - Do you want to take a shower? - No, go ahead. - No, I mean together? Your husband's been taking you for granted a little bit, don't you think? - Yeah. - Yeah. Here. Let me go get my shower cap. - You made LSD? Is that-- That's what you're saying? - Yeah. Oh, yeah, but-- - We made LSD. - Yes, yes. We made acid. - And we gave it out to people who needed it. You know that there are hundreds of pharmaceutical executives in this country... - Oh! - that are selling drugs, FDA approved drugs? - Oh! - On the open market. - Oh, on the-- Over the counter with incredible side-- - Horrible side effects. - Terrible side effects. - And these people are not in jail. - They're not in prison anywhere. They're, they're, they're in country clubs or playing golf. They're having drinks. - They're running the country. - They're not-- - They're running the country, Mel. - Y-You know, LSD shouldn't be a felony in the first place. - It's not addictive. - It doesn't lead to violent crime. - Uh-huh, uh-huh. - It's really the only hope for the species. - Yeah. D-Did you take acid while you were pregnant with me? You're not gonna bring that thing up, are you? You know the stuff they tell you about, you know, chromosome damage and all that stuff? - Yeah, I do! - That's government propaganda. - Total propaganda. - They just want to get a hold of your head, that's all. I was relieved, though, when you came out in the hospital and you only had one head. - Very funny. - She-- She kills me! - Oh, he was such a cute baby. - It would've been kinda nice... - if he had, like, a third eye right there, you know? - Mm-hmm. - I-- M-Mel-- - You know, you know, a third eye is a symbol of enlightenment. - You kn-- You know, he's not-- he's not, he's not getting it. He's-- - Mel. - Identity is nothing but a mental construct. - Mental construct? - You mustn't fixate on it. - Have you ever read any Tibetan Buddhism, like Chaos theory? - Oh, Geez. - Paul? - Is he okay? - Oh! - Are you okay there, Paul? - Is this a musical table? - ''Is this a musical table''? - Paul, can I get you something? - I'm not feeling very well. - What, what do you mean? What is it? What, what is it? - Let me help you. What is it? - What are you going through? - Do you want-- Do you want to lie down? - I don't know. - Can, can I get you something, Paul? - How do you feel? - Vivid. - Paul? Here. - What? - I'm seeing colours that I don't want to see. -Did you hear that? He's seeing colours. -Just go with it. That's all right. He needs to lie down. - Wait, let me move this. You're gonna have to help me. - Everything's moving. - Paul, can you hear me? - Goddam it! Lonnie! - Lonnie! - Don't fly off the handle. - Come in here. Come here. - What did you do to Paul's quail? - Nothing. Why? Come on. Don't give me that fake innocence. What did you do? I dosed Mel's dish. I meant it for Mel, and then he ate it. - Oh, my God. How much? - Two and a half tabs. Two and a half tabs? Are you crazy? Are you nuts? Doesn't your mother have enough to worry about tonight? - I just don't understand this. - Why do you ha-- Now, why do you have to talk to me like that? - Am I-- Am I talking to him in some special way? - It's really embarrassing to me... and I really don't appreciate it in front of him. - I mean, who is he? - What-- What's wrong with him? What-- - You got the whole science thing going... and the next thing I, I know, you like him better than me because he's more like you than I am. - We love you very much. Even if you were Jeffrey Dahmer, we would love you. - Yeah, sure! - Oh, you know, Mom spare me the hyp-- - Wait, I'm not here to take your place. - Please, Mel, please! - Where do you get this insecurity from? - I don't understand it. This drives me nuts! - Uh, honey? - Richard, you're criticizing. - All right, all right. I want you to apologize to Mel and to Paul right now. C'mon. C'mon. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry for what? - I'm sorry... that I put windowpane in Mel's quail, and I'm sorry that you ate it. All right. All right. Go sit down. I can't believe he-- Let's not blow this out of proportion, everyone. Paul's gonna come down in about ten hours. - Ten hours? - I-- It's-- I-- It's-- I can't believe you-- you're actually keeping acid in the house after you went to prison for it. - Wait till your son is 19. See if he does everything you want him to do. - Tina. - This is classic! Yeah, just keep, uh-- keep blaming it all on me, all your crap. - Ah, just go with it. You just simmer down, you. And you take a little responsibility for what you've done. - Thank you, Mrs Cleaver. - Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. - All there is. - This is a non-smoking house. - You're gonna be all right. - Are you kidding? -Just go with it. - We're gonna take quite a trip. - You know, it's been a long day... and, uh, I'm really, really tired. So, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hit the hay. Thank you very much for, um, dinner. It was wonderful. - My love in Paris - Shh! - Knows my secret -Just go with it.Just go with it. - He's gonna be fine. - She's a great guide. - I'm, I'm sure you are an excellent guide. And I would like to thank you again for this wonderful evening. It was really great. - It was great seeing you. Yeah. - Yeah. Thanks. - I mean, I loved meeting you. I loved meeting you too, and I'm just gonna hit the hay. - Now, you're sure that you don't want dessert? - Really feel awful. - No. - Um, I think I'm gonna lay off the food, yeah. - Close. - If you get hungry later, it's in the fridge, okay? - Okay, good night. Nighty-night, you two. Uh, night. - Will do. Yum! Good night. - Chocolate mousse. You're gonna love it. You're gonna-- Yeah. - Very nice to meet you. It was really great. - See ya, Tina. - Tina! Good night, Tina. - Go with it, Paul. - I guess it's just one of those ex-felon... pro-acid kind of non-smoking homes. It's a weird, weird home. And where's Nancy? Where is she? - She's somewhere in one of these rooms with Tony. They're in there-- - You know what, Mel? You need to settle down. This is overwhelming. This is hitting you all at once. You know what, sweetheart? Just-- Just come in here for a second. We'll just sit down, cool off a bit. Boy! Oh, boy. Well, you know, what did I expect, right? I'm sorry this is all hitting you at the same time... but after it passes and things settle down, you can think about starting over. - Why can't you just use soap? - You know, soap dries your skin out. Not that I'm one of those women who obsesses about old-looking skin after pregnancy. - I just happen to be obsessing about it right now. - Well-- - Wait, wait, wait. - You know, you're absolutely right. We don't need to rush into this. - I haven't even finalized my divorce yet. - No, I could've kissed you just now... and felt okay about it, but I didn't, and I felt really wrong. Don't take this personally, but with all your nervous energy... you kinda remind me of my mother. Ow! - Do you mind if I look at your armpit? - My armpit? Yeah, it's my favourite part of a woman's body. I mean, it-- May I? - What's attractive about an armpit? - Are you kidding? Lots of things. Look at this, the definition. Look at the contours here. The depth of the pocket. Feel that? So nice. - Of course I feel rejected. - I'm sorry. But I shouldn't. You're not an appropriate partner for me. Your life's a mess, and you don't make enough money anyway. That's a really nasty thing to say. You just told me I reminded you of your mother. Well, she's-- I mean, she's a good person. She's got a lot of great qualities. Uh, uh-- I don't want to wreck your marriage. I know how painful that that can be. My marriage is obviously vulnerable at this point. Every marriage is vulnerable, otherwise being married... wouldn't mean anything, would it? - Paul. - Tony. I need to see Tony. - No, I want you to-- - I want you to tell me if you have a favourite animal. - Oh, that's so stupid. Listen to what Mary says. She's a great guide, okay? Just listen to her. - Okay. - What's your-- - A dog. - A dog. Uh, what is your favourite dog? - A coll-- St Bernard. St Bernard. St Bernard. Good. I want you to picture a big, furry St Bernard curled up by the fireplace. - Can I change my mind? Yeah. - No, no, we're-- we're gonna stick with the St Bernard. - I want to do a Springer Spaniel. - No, it doesn't have to be the perfect dog. - Uh, Dalmatian. Dal-- - No, no, no. D-- - Okay, Dalmatian. Now, this dog represents security-- - Schnauzer. - What? - Schnauzer. - Shut the fuck up! - I am trying to help you. Do you understand me? - Hey, come on, sweetheart. - You're so good.Just relax, okay? Just take it easy now. Take it easy. - Okay. Okay, okay. Paul! Paul! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Can we stop all this craziness, huh? - Yes! I wasn't even enjoying that. - It seems like you were enjoying it. - The attention, maybe, but-- - Okay. All right. Time for you to go, okay? You haven't been treating her very well. Do you know that? Oh, uh-- You know what? You know what, buddy? You know, you got a lot of nerve. You come in here, you lick my wife's armpit. You know, you-- I, uh, uh, uh-- I'm gonna have that image in my head... - for the rest of my life of your tongue in there. I-- It's, it's, it's-- - You deserve it. - This is felonious, and I want to make an arrest. - Warm him up. - Shh! - What? What he say? - He's tripping his brains out. - He doesn't know who he is. - Did he say-- he say-- He said arrest. What do you mean he-- We don't know who he is. - He's Mel's friend Paul. - I know exactly who I am. I'm Paul Harmon. - Good. - Bureau of Tobacco, Tobacco, and Tobacco. - Good. What is this, Paul? - It is a badge. - What kind of badge? - I'm a Special Agent man. Twenty years in the service. Graduated fourth in my class. - Is this a-- Is this a joke? - I don't joke about those things. - Goddam it. - I knew it was weird. I knew it. When they called up out of the blue like that, I knew. - He's-- - No, you had to see your son. - He's kidding. He's making a joke. He's just-- Oh. - You're not kidding. Shit. - I am not kidding. Everything is under control. - Okay. All right. All right. I want you to both move over against that wall. This is an arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, we will provide an attorney for you... because we provide things for you people all the-- Oh! That really hurt. I can't follow your fickle little moods all over the place. - That has got to change. - Okay, I will. I promise. If you just give me a chance, let me show you I can be less selfish. I-- I-I will show you. You will get concrete results. You have got to earn that back with some consistent behaviour, pal. Look, I'm sorry I acted this way. I'm sorry I've treated you this way. I-- I've got to be out of my mind to risk losing you. - You don't hit another human being! - Will you be quiet! - My-- Goddam it! Just shut the hell up! Just be quiet. All right, nobody heard us upstairs. We're all right. - We have to get him to a doctor. - Oh, no. There's no doctor. Forget the doctor. - What, no doctor? He's hurt. Paul. - I've gotta think of what we're gonna do.Just give me a minute. - Paul, wake up. Wake up, Paul. - I'm not-- I'm not goin' back to jail. I'm not going back to jail. - Paul, wake up. - You know where I'm goin'? I'm goin' to Mexico. We're all goin' to Mexico. - And we're taking him as a hostage. - A hostage? - Cool! - What are you talking about? - I'm not going to jail again. - You understand me? I'm not going to jail! - Oh, my God. This has to be a mistake. Mel wouldn't do this to us. - How do you know it's Mel? How do you know who Mel is? Mel is probably in on this. Mel-- - He's a-- He's a pig! How do you know it's our son? It's not our son. It's some fucking Federal Agent! - Goddam it. - I know it's our son. I can tell. - Uh, w-- - You think a mother doesn't know these things? -Just shut up for a minute and listen. We're gonna take him in the car, then we go down to San Miguel to Stuart's place. - We can be there by morning. Grab his foot. This guy is-- - Paul, wake-- No! No. I am not walking away from a home that took us 20 years to put together. - This guy is-- - No! - The wheel barrow. - This is insane. We can't take him hostage. This is a much bigger crime. - Well, what'll we do? What'll-- What'll we do with him? - Dump-- Dump him in the brush. - Brush! Good, good. - Leave him and get outta here. - Lonnie. - Yeah. - Go clean out the lab. - Right. Don't break anything! No, no, no. Wai-- Wait a minute. Shit! This truck is not going to make it to Mexico. - So what are we-- - Oh, shit! Put it in here. My sciatica is killing me. Would've been here an hour ago if you'd listened to me. It took two hours to find that there's no place to get a good sandwich around here. You can't keep making U-turns in the middle of a highway, Eddie... - even if you see what looks like a sandwich shop. - Let's get this over with. Eddie-- Eddie, wait. Don't. What's the matter? Come on! - I can't go in there. - Why not? - Look at this house. - What's the matter with it? Well, it's so all-American. It's-- - What are you talking about? - Well, they're probably... quiet, reasonable, sensible people... and Mel loves them, and, you know, we're neur-- - And he-- We're a source of embarrassment to him. - But he's in trouble... and that's why we came! - It's possible I overreacted. - Now you think you overreacted? - Yeah. We-- - We just got off an aeroplane. - We drove five and a half hours in the desert... - Listen, Eddie... - and you're telling me that you overreacted? - I am not going in there to be rejected in front of his new parents! - Yes, you are! Come on. Pearl. - No, I'm not. Let go of me. - Come on, Pearl. - You're hurting my arm. - You feel that? - Get in the car before they hear us. - I thought we were gonna eat here. I'm starving. - We'll go back to the taco place. - Tacos have cheese in them. - Not all tacos have cheese in them, Eddie. - Wait, is this our car? - Of course it's our car. - Do you remember this truck? - What, do you have early Alzheimer's? It's a white rental car-- - Where's the car? - It's over here. What's the matter with you? - Why did you move it? - I thought you moved it. - Why would I move it? - I don't know, Dad. - What are we taking that car for? - I wanna take the blue truck. - No, no, we can't take the truck. - The truck can't make an 800-mile trip. - Oh, no. My blue truck. I want my blue truck. - Mom, come o-- come on! - But my water broke in this truck. Get in the car. I love you. Get in the car. Are you sure all your doubting is over? I'm sorry I took you for granted. I'm sorry I hurt you. I want to go home tomorrow. So do I. I want to get out of here. - Slow down. There's the taco place. - Why didn't you tell me you saw it? I did tell you. You were driving too fast. You can't make U-turns like this, Eddie. - Relax. We're in the middle of nowhere. - The, the sign! The sign, the sign! The-- Aah! The car! Goddam tourists! Shit! - What did I just tell you about the U-turns? - He was in my blind spot. You could fit the state of Wisconsin in your blind spot. -It's their fault. They're in the wrong. -Doesn't matter. I don't want some sheriff to come by here. - Wh-Where's the-- Where's the acid? - It's in the trunk, Dad. Yeah. - It's in the trunk? Look. Look, if things get tight, I want you to do that spastic colon thing you do. -No, no, I'm not gonna do spastic colon. -Okay, now, do-- something. That thing you did when the cops stopped us in Albuquerque, you know? That, that, what, that ulcer thing. - Um-- Uh, okay, I-- I'll do reflux. - All right. That's good. Okay. - I am so sorry! - Are you all right? - Yeah, we're fine. You can't just make a blind U-turn like that. I've got a sizable blind spot, is my problem. - Well, I don't see much damage here. - No, it looks mostly cosmetic. - Yeah. It's nothing. Why don't we just forget about it, all right? - No, no. Well, I don't know. We shouldn't leave the scene of an accident. I'll call the police from the taco place. Well, you can call the police if you want to, but, I mean... I-I'll tell you right now, this, this is your fault here. I mean, if we make a report, y-your insurance rates are gonna go sky-high. - I mean, it's up to you, but, I mean, I don't, I don't see the point of it. - Uh, Pearl, he's making sense. No! I have never broken the law. I am not going to be irresponsible now. - Yeah, there's nothing irresponsible about this. - No, absolutely. We're all fine. There's-- You can see that we're perfectly okay. I, uh, I, I just have this preexisting medical condition. My ileocecal valve is, uh-- doesn't work as it should. And it allows c-corrosive juices-- They seem to rise up into my oesophagus, and I-- I, I, I need to get home so that I can lie down and-- - We, we really have to go. - With my head elevated. - Ileocecal valve? - It's chronic. - Nice meeting you. Why did you let them get away? We're better off. Who knows what our liability is? Y-Yes! What, what exactly is our deductible damage waiver? Here-- Oh, my God! - The car-- it's registered to Mel! - What? Look at the-- Check and see if our luggage is in the trunk. Huh? What the hell is this? Sometimes the light's all shining on me Other times, I can barely see - So then what happened? - I don't know-- I don't know where anybody is. - I mean, I assume-- I mean, look at this place. It's a wreck. - Well, I see the place. - I-I guess they probably-- Well, then-- - And I'm looking for him, and I can't find him. - So where-- - They probably took him to the hospital, Tony. I mean, he, he was-- They didn't take him to the hospital. Look. Paul! Oh, my God! - Truckin', I'm a-going home - You can't catch the wind! Whoa, whoa, baby back where I belong -Jerry? W-- - Mm-hmm. -Jerry Garcia Jerry? - Yeah! I mean, it's in the family. It's got a whole history to it. You don't even like the Grateful Dead. I never said I don't like them. I just haven't ever listened to that much of their music. Unless you still like Ethan. This is obviously much more important to you than it is to me. Okay? So you pick the name. But I'll just say one thing. - What? - I think Jerry is very pedestrian. How 'bout Garcia? - Garcia? - Garcia Coplin. Garcia! Garcia Coplin. - Look.
