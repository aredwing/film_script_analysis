They are built like tanks. Even kids lift 80. They don't even consider anything less than 160. So, brother, shall I load them? Do it. Yes. Do it. Chandni, you don't know my brothers. This is nothing. I was very small. But I remember... ...that the jeep was stuck in the sand. These two lifted the jeep and pushed it to a side. Wow. One's He-man. The other is Superman. Yes. Brother, I'll load 20 more. He is going to get me killed. Chandni, you don't know my brothers. Brother Uday and brother Yashwant... ...had pushed a truck once. What is he blabbering away?

You were leaving. Come, let's go. Veer. At least tell me now why I am here. Brother, I don't even know why I am here. Brother Bhanu. What happened to you? Did you fall off a horse? What do you think? Can any horse throw me off its back? I slipped in the bathroom. - I see. Were you wearing an underwear? Let's go, Chandni. Come on. - Take care, sir. Yes. I was wearing an underwear. Bye. Ghadiyal Singh. - Master. 10:01. So, young lady. His Highness, Chandraveer Singh Rathod... ...is ready forthe interview. - Okay. First question. How did Jaigadh and Khemgadh accept this alliance? Bloody good question. You see... in 1990. No, sorry. In 1945, my father... No, I think. I think in 1498 ourforefather... ...Maharaval Daler Singh Khanda... ...sat in Khemgadh and, from Philodhi. Now where the hell is Philodhi. Philodi was... No, no. It can't be upstairs. So. Yes. He expanded his kingdom from Philodhi to Kekdi. Now, the Panipat battle in 1526... So that's how this alliance was accepted. Next question. There's nothing left. What do you mean by "There's nothing left". You answered all the questions in yourfirst answer. That was the last one. That's... that's what we royal people are all about. Now, young lady, I am going to ask you a question. - Me? Yes. - Okay. How were you named Chandni? Good question. - Always. Me. - Yes. Actually, Mr. CV Singh. It's not Mr. CV Singh, its Your Highness. Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness. Pardoned. Come on. Actually, my mother and father went to see a movie... ...forthe first time aftertheir marriage. Chandni. The 'Dhak-Dhak' girl. - No. The 'Nau-Nau Chudiyaan'. Oh, the 'Nau-Nau Chudiyaan' girl, got it, got it. Then what happened? As soon as the song began... ...I kicked forthe first time in my mother's womb. Really? Kicked? And father said "Let me tell you one thing... "... if it's a girl then her name will be Chandni. " Good idea. Good idea. But I have royal question. What if it had been a boy? What then? That's a point? - Then... Chandra Chud. Chandra Chud? Chandra Chud. Come, Devika. Join us. She was interviewing me and now I am interviewing her. Darling, you see you are very jolly, you are very charming. You are so beautiful, you are so... You are so Chandni. But why aren't you married yet. I mean, is everything okay? Come on, tell me. Actually everything is fine, but... ...I have very little hope of getting married. I feel I will stay unmarried. Why do you say that? Actually, all the astrologers tell me the same thing. That if I want to get married then, I will have to do it this month. Otherwise, there is no other auspicious phase for me. There are just three-four days left now. That's a serious issue. I have another problem. I can't find a boy of my level. So, what kind of a boy are you looking for? Like Veer. I mean someone like your personality. Okay, carry on. You know, intellectual, smart, handsome like you. I am a complete man. Yes. Complete man. There is a... Chandni darling. Before Divya gets married and leaves... ...I will find a boy foryou. That's... that's a Rajput's promise. Thank you so much, Your Highness. But, look around you, not too far. Don't worry about that. "Chandni. " "My Chandni. " Here. "I will... say exactly... what you like to hear. " Yes, master. Thank you. Veer. - Yes, brother. Brother. She is not a girl. She's a 12 mm bullet. And she has pierced my heart. I am sorry, Veer. I won't even look at the moon from today. I am sorry. Veer. Where are you lost? I am sorry. You were saying something. Yes. How do I load her in my double-barrel heart? Give me an idea. Tell me. You know these girls from London. Tell me. Brother, these London girls are very smart. Very smart. You will have to directly attack. - Attack? Direct attack. Corner her. Embrace hertightly. And kiss her. You will get me killed. Brother, if you think too much... ...then she will slip out of your hands. And anyway, Brother Uday and brother Prithvi... ...are trying their luck as well. I will... Forget about them, and think about her. Are you sure? - 100 percent, brother. Yes. Brother, what are you doing? She is your girlfriend. That's why I know what she will do. Now watch the fun. Chandni. "I will... say exactly... what you like to hear. " "I will... say exactly... what you like to hear. " "If you call day as night, then so will I." "I will... say exactly... what you like to hear. " Didn't I tell you? Brother. I am leaving. Brother, you took a little long in stopping her and kissing her. She shoots guns... and slaps as well. She's the girl of my type. She will be Mrs. Ywant. Yes. Thank you, Veer. Thank you, brother. God bless you. I will have to think of another idea. Hello, Priest. Here you go. I have brought weapons forthe veneration. You got them? - Yes. Master. - Yes. Yourteeth are very beautiful. I am seeing them for the first time in 32 years. Hi. Come, let's go together. We will like it as well. Yes, and we will eat something as well. - Of course. Even dogs eat food. Be a man, drink alcohol. Chandni. You don't know my brothers. No, Veer. - No. - No, no, no. She knows, she knows. Brother Prithvi is a wonderful driver. From Philodhi to Kekdi... ...there is no driver who can compete with him. Oh yes! - There... - Amazing! Listen. It's my turn.

We are meeting today after London. Greet him. Greetings. Rascals, what did you two think... ...that you two will get engaged quietly. Engagement? - See, Pammi. As soon as we got the good news... ...we turned the car around and came here. Good news. What good news. There is no good news here. Stop blabbering and show me the room. Pammi needs to use the bathroom. What the hell is going on? Who are they to create a ruckus in this royal family? Hello. - Hello. Introduce us as well. - Veer, who are they? Tell him who we are. Father, he is Fatoor Singh and she is Pammi. Fatoor Singh and Pammi, so? Do you want me to welcome them with a garland? Give our complete introduction, who we are. Father, they... they... They... they... Why don't you just tell him something? Son, say it quickly. Father, they are Punjab's number one decorator. What? Especially called forthe decoration. Decorators. Decorator? Yes. Decorator. I understood. Yes. Punjab's no. 1 decorator. And who is this young lady? - His assistant number 1. Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me, guys. Excuse me. What is this? Veer, what is this? I am there forthese things, am I not? Please, trust me. - No, no, you are the planner. And he's the decorator. He has conducted all the big marriages in Punjab. Yes. My grandfather got Buta Singh, Zail Singh... ...Manmohan Singh, Milkha Singh married. And we have two years of waiting. Once the waiting got so long... ...that we got the mother and father married... ...on the second birthday of their child, isn't it? Yes, Kishen Singh. Good joke. Okay, Veer. Find a good hotel around and make their arrangements. Yes, yes. - What are you saying, mister? Visitors from Punjab don't stay in hotels. Open up a room here. Tell them. - Yes, yes. I apologise. Sorry, I apologise. All right. Chandni. Look, we have called the number one decoratorfrom Punjab. Come on. Now are you going to make Pammi a maid? She's doing the dishes in the corner. Will that look good? There was no other option. But why did you need to come here? Bunty, you said you're getting engaged. So we came here happily. Yes, but... Bunty. Who is Bunty? Bunty is this girl. Your name is Bunty? Pet name. Really? Never mind. This is not the time. But I was just joking about the engagement. And you've landed up here. Look, parents take everything the kids say seriously. We never knew you would take such serious offence in our coming here. No, mother. It's not that. It's okay. I'll go tell CV Singh that we're Chandni's parents. We're here to get her married. Simple. This is not that simple. Why? What happened? You don't know my father. He can do anything. Once Divya gets married, I'll tell him everything. It's just a matter of three days. But what's the problem? Veer's father is a little crazy. Crazy? Sorry. How can you call my father crazy? Thank God that I'm not explaining to them with expletives. That is how they understand. Hello. - Hello. This is my mother. Hello. - And these are Chandni's parents. I am really sorry you all had to do all this. It's okay. Father... - Keep quiet. Don't worry. I had played many roles in college. Doctor. Inspector. Conductor. Decorator is not an issue. We're even ready to become beggars for Bunty's happiness. Absolutely. - Who is Bunty? Forget it, mother. Now all happy? - Yes. Very good. Not happy. Happy Singh. Shut up. Happy Singh. Gosh! Happy Singh. Oh, no. Go ahead. I'll make a call and join you. Please. Please come. See. See who's calling. - Yes. Who is calling? Answer it quickly. Hello. Hello. - Brother, hello.

Please understand. - What are you doing? And do it proper... Who is this idiot who has put up curtains with such disgusting colors? Take it off. Red curtain. Red. Excuse me. Hello. Excuse me. This hall will have this color. I have decided only after consulting CV sir. Okay? - Keep quiet, you knucklehead. Who is the decorator number one? Me or CV? Excuse... - It will be red. Red. It will be Fuschia. Okay? Pushia. Pushia. You speak such fowl language. Aren't you ashamed? Not Pushia. Fuschia. Yes. The same thing. You bonehead. Say it again. Then see what I do to you. What can you do? What can you do? You keep quiet. Tell me. What are you going to do? I... I will report you to CV sir. Go ahead. Report me. I was never afraid of even my own father. So you think I am going to be afraid of someone else's father? Really? Give him a kick up his back side. Throw him out. Come on. - Throw him out. Come on, let's go. What are you doing down there? Get up. Get up. Rascals. Take this off. What did he say about His Highness? Sir, when I told him that this decoration... ...has been approved by CV sir, you know what he said. Change this. I am the number one decorator. What else? - Sir, he said. Go tell CVthat I am not scared... ...of even his forefathers, let alone him. Darn you! How dare you say that! Where the... Where is he? Come on, brother. The same color on the other side as well. What's your problem? This bonehead is my problem, brother. He had put up such dull colors. So boring. Look at this. I have put up 'Rade'. What's 'Rade'? 'Rade' means red, brother. Father, what's the problem? Mr. Fatoor Singh, is there some problem? Son, come here. You're an intelligent boy. These two colors. This bonehead had put up this dull color. And I have put up the red color. Tell me. Which one is better? You have a good taste. I am sorry, father. But I like red. You see. - Hold on. Chandni, please come here. I'll show you taste. Dear, tell me. Do you like Fuschia or his red color? Tell me. Honestly? - Yes. I like Fuschia. But... - Hold on a minute. Chandni said Fuschia looks good. So Fuschia it will be. But hell... This color is so dull. What do you people know about taste? You don't even have good names. Names should be like the ones we have. Chandraveer Pratap Singh. Suryaveer Pratap Singh. Bhavani Singh. And your names. Pappu Singh. Tikku Singh. Babbu Singh. You have kid like names. But, brother, the movie was made on us. Singh is King. You too are a king. Why wasn't it made on you? Tell me. That's because... That's because we... - Bury it. Bury it. - Where? In the mud. Look... Cheers, father. Cheers to 'Rade'. You're a very funny man, Fatoor Singh. Brother, it's your grace. I'll tell you a story, sir. - Why not? One of our neighbors wanted a divorce from his wife being fed up of her. The judge asked why. The neighbor said that I am not happy with my wife. Happens. Wife said, "Look, the entire colony is happy with me. " "I can't satisfy the lust of this one man. " Well done. Well done. The wife said, "What do you mean?" "Look, the entire colony is happy with me. " "I can't satisfy only your lust. " The wife said, "What do you mean?" "Look, the entire colony is happy with me.

How would I know his crazy father... ...will seriously call Pappi Sardarto get you married? Whom were you talking to on the phone? I had called up Just Dial. I was talking to him about Pappi Sardar. But that rascal also didn't understand anything. He disconnected. From where will you bring Pappi Sardar? Father said he will shoot you. I have brought 40 men. All are aged. 'Hey you. ' No. No. No. No. Don't even think of it. Don't even think of it. Have you all gone mad? Did you see? Because of him his father will shoot me. Because of me? Very funny! I won't do it. If you don't do it, go and tell him the truth. Hold on. Veer, I know it's not the best idea. But you only have to play a drama for half an hour. Behave so insolently that uncle will throw you out. Simple. - But... Chandni, if by chance he asks you, reject him. If motherfinds out, she will get hyper. Why will you tell your mother? I don't even know Punjabi. You were having an affair with herforthe past two years. She must have taught you something. Hey, you. Where is everyone? Look, who has come! The way it should be. Try and pull up overthere.

How very charming! Thank you. He is Pappi. We have called him from Ludhiana for Chandni's marriage. Where did you study in London? Hey, you! Am I crazy? That I will go to London and waste my money? What do you mean? When you can do correspondence... ...then why waste money? In correspondence they don't teach you how to say... ...why waste the money? Forget it. Even television can teach me to speak like that. Good. Pappi, it will be better if you remove your sunglasses and talk. I can't remove my sunglasses. I have got conjunctivitis. From where? It's conjunctivitis. I have heard there is a wedding in this house. If you say, I will remove it. No. Let it be. You also wear it. Fine. Where did Veer go? Veer. Yes, father. What did you say? Teeth. Teeth. The elephant teeth in your palace, it's superb. It's marvelous. We royals have all kinds of ancient things. Come, dear. Come. Come. Come. My son. After a long time. You are looking handsome in this getup. Here. Sit here. - Yes. Look, Chandni has also come. Hello. - Hello. Sit here. Sit here. You are fairerthan milk. Shall I kiss you? Insolent. Shameless. What are you doing to my sons? Pardon me. I am interfering in yourfamily matters. But in ourfamily it's insolence to drink in front of elders. If you had slapped him once when he was a kid... ...he wouldn't have behaved like that today. You will be beaten badly. Before you tell me to leave, it will be betterthat I leave. Fatoor Singh, see me to the door. - Get lost. Hold on. Now what? Chandni. - Yes. Go out with him. I want to discuss something in your absence. Royal discussion. Darling... You... Gorgeous...

Keep it inside. Keep it inside, Rana Pratap. We will tackle him later. Reject me quickly. The beard is very itchy. Yes? I am coming. What do you think about my girl? She is deluxe. What do you mean by deluxe? Stupendous. Okay. Stupendous. Dear, do you like him? I don't like him at all. I know what you mean. I also didn't like him. He is loud, garish. He doesn't belong to a royal family. But he is cultured. Cultured. Wow! Wow! What I couldn't do with Prithvi in so many years... ...he did it with one slap. When I was young, I was also like you. I would be a lion. Until Devika tamed me. Thank you, Devika. Great, sister-in-law! Great! Dear, you wanted a man having my personality, right? If you care for my opinion even a bit, marry him. Dear, forthe first time in life I am taking a decision for someone... ...who is not my family. So don't do anything to mock me and make me feel ashamed. This royal dagger is foryou as a wedding token. But, Your Highness... His Highness has decided. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... ...Mr. Zoravar Singh in our royal family. I will commit suicide with this. May your enemies die! We will do one thing. We will make Pappi disappear. We will make some excuse. We will say Pappi ran away. Quiet. - We will say he fell from the terrace and died. Yes. I will use you as the corpse. You are right. Best idea. We will say there was a fire in his factory. So he left. Flop idea. Pappi can't do anything to humiliate father. What bond do you share with Pappi? But he is my father, right? Father should be ridiculed because of me. No. I won't let that happen. Don't worry. If Ijog my brains, I will come up with countless ideas. No. No. No. Please don't jog your brains. Please. But there must be some solution. I will have to remain Pappi. When will you be Veer? - When I won't be Pappi. Veer. Yes? Remove your goggles. - What? Otherwise Pappi Sardar will be exposed. What? Be careful. Veer. - Yes? What happened? Where were you? You are missing since morning. Where were you? I had gone out forfather's work. What work? The priest had given a list. Father said to bring some things. What list? That... It's here. - Forget the list. Do you know what's going on? What? Father has fixed Chandni's marriage with Pappi Sardar. It's great news. We should congratulate her. - Veer. Are you on my side? Or... I mean, are you on our side? Or on Pappi Sardar's side? Absolutely. - Pappi Sardar... He is a cheap man. You don't understand. - True. Our Chandni's life will be ruined, Veer. Chandni's life will be ruined, Our Chandni? What do you mean? No. No. No. She has come to our house as a guest. She is a nice girl. She is our kin. What else? Right? We will have to teach Pappi Sardar a lesson. What lesson, brother? I will chop him. - Exactly. I will begin with his legs. I will cut his toes first. Then his knees, then his thighs and then... No. No. No, brother. It's a flop idea. Do you remember? Last time you had thrashed that boy. All of you were right. - Yes. Still father scolded all of you. Remember? What else will we do? What? What will we do? I suggest send naked girls to his room. We will click his photo and show it to father. And say, "Look, you are conducting Chandni's marriage... " "... with such a derogatory man. " Father will shoot him. What? You are right, brother. Genius! Yes! - Right. You will arrange forthe naked girls. You are right. Let me think. - Of course. Rani has gone to her village. Pushpa. She won't come naked in front of anyone. There must be more. There must be more. Do one thing. Your murder plan is better. Do that. Come on. - No. No. No. You must have some other idea. You are trying hard to save him. I don't share any bond with him. I don't share any bond with him. Wait in the old fort at night. - Yes. I will cajole him and bring him there. Thrash him in the dark. Nobody will know who beat him. Fantastic, Veer! Not bad! Shall we go? Hey, girl. Devika. - Why are you doing this to Veer? There is no other option but to adjust for Veer. One girl and two husbands. Two husbands? No. No. No. Devika, you are just getting it all wrong. Veer... Veer is Pappi Sardar. What? Veer is Pappi? Veer is Pappi? - Yes. That's true. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Thank you. Tradition. Tradition. Tradition. You know tradition. Okay? So all boys will feed the girls. Henna or no henna. Your Highness, you will feed Devika. Royally. - Yes.

Now, ladies, you enjoy your evening together. Gentlemen, please follow the royal king. Right? - Yes, uncle. What do you mean uncle? It's not uncle. It's His Highness. You see, after drinking four pegs everybody gets high. Very funny! I am forced to laugh. I hope your parents are coming forthe wedding. Actually, Your Highness, my parents can't come. - But why? Because they are dead. I am so sorry to hearthat. - What had happened? Accident. When? - 1985. How? - Car. Where? Ludhiana-Bhatinda Highway. Will you explain in details? - Let it be. No. I want to hear. No. He is asking for details. I will tell him. - Okay. Fine. Your Highness. - Yes. In those days there were ambassador cars. Of course, I know. Mother and father were returning to Ludhiana at night. The driver must have dozed off. - Oh! The car collided with a truck carrying iron rods. Oh, God. One rod entered my father's head. - Okay. It entered the eye and went through the skull. - Okay. His brains were dripping from the rod. Like this. No. It's alright. It's alright. The way... the way... cream drips from your biscuit. Yes.

His Highness of Khandwar. Hello. Son, he is very impressed with you. - Thank you. He wants to conduct his daughter's marriage with you. And I have given my consent. Veer, accept this as the wedding token. Father, I am sorry. I can't marry. Mr. Chandraveer Singh, you should have told me before. Permit me. What did you say? I can't marry. Why? Because I love Chandni. Father. - Father. We also love Chandni. Brother, please. Don't joke. Veer, you were never vying for her. We are trying since the beginning. Of course. - Brother, stop it. Please. But we... - Shut up. But... Chandni was going to marry Pappi Sardar. I will tell you. Look, Chandni is not a reporter. I am not a decorator. But he is Pappi Sardar. What? Father, I am sorry. I lied to you. The truth is that I love Chandni. And I want to marry her. Why didn't you tell me before? I was afraid of you, father. - You aren't afraid now? Father, you said Chandni is like your daughter. That's why I searched a groom for her. What difference does it make if I am the groom? It makes a difference. Chandni is not a Rajput. She is not a royal. One moment. Shall I tell you one thing? I am not even Punjabi. to Mt. Abu for vacationing. They found me at a temple's steps and brought me home. I was an orphan. For a moment imagine, if you had come instead of them... ...you would have also done the same thing. Because I have seen a lot of love in your eyes. What would I have been called then? A Rajput? Royal enough? Whatever. But I know one thing. This marriage won't take place. All of you can leave. Mr. CV Singh, you... - Get out. Out. Enough. Enough, uncle. Come on. - Let's go. Come, dear. Chandni, hold on. Father, forgive me. But I also will have to go with them. What do you mean? I can't marry any other girl. Ghadiyal Singh. Sir, 07:29. Give me my gun. I said give me my gun. I will shoot him. - Father, no. No. No. truly loved a girl. But I couldn't musterthe courage to speak in front of you. Just because she wasn't a Rajput. Don't stop Veer. Otherwise like me he will also be seen in... ...somebody's marriage after 15 years. Veer. Go, Veer. Congratulations, Mr. CV Singh. Congratulations. Heartiest congratulations, Mr. CV Singh. You are going through a bad time. Let's see what the problem is. What do you mean? - I mean... ...father and I have sworn that we will tarnish... ...your very honour that you are so proud of. If you want to take revenge, then you can do it later. Today is his daughter's marriage. Let the marriage take place. Marriage! How can the marriage take place? The wedding procession from Jaigadh is in our custody. You don't have any other option left. Get Divya married to me. Stupid. What kind of a fool are you? I understand that you want to take revenge. You want to tarnish their honour... ...I understand that as well. But did yourfather lose his mind... ...that he sent you here to give this message? Couldn't you send them a sms worth 50 paise? Look, if anything happens to me, then your wedding guests... What will they do? - What will they do to the procession? What will they do? Mr. CV Singh. We can settle our personal score later. Right now it's the question of this family's honour. We will bring the wedding procession back in return of this joker. Come on. Is anyone coming along or not? Yes, brother. Go ahead. Anant Vijay. Don't dance before these dogs. Listen carefully. As long as you keep dancing yourfather will stay alive. "Maybe they are thinking about my marriage. " "That's why mother has invited you to tea. " "Seeing this lonely bird, this trap has been laid. " "That's why your mother has invited me to tea. " What is this place? What are you doing? Michael Jackson. Is he your son? How did you get caught in their clutches? You asked me to inform Mr. CV Singh. Couldn't you send a sms worth 50 paise? That's exactly what I told you. Let's complete this deal. The priest is waiting for us at the marriage dais. Otherwise... - Otherwise we will take him back. Fine. Let him go. Stop. Charge. Attack. What is going on? Everything was going well. Brother, how would I know everything is okay? My gun. Where's my gun. Father. - What? What happened, baby? They hit me. Oh my baby. Come, come. Come on. Come on. - Save me. Save me. Save me. Where is Paan Singh. Someone get me down. Uncle. Someone save him. Just a minute. Just a minute. Will you break my head? Fatoor Singh, enough of your charade. My gun. Got him. Ghajini. Dabangg. Wanted. Singham. Dirty Picture. Pardon or death? What shall we do with you? Spare me. Okay. Okay. Let us forgive and forget. Come on. - Okay. You know, Fatoor Singh, I have realised that I am a royal fool. Sometimes royal people can make royal mistakes. But I have also realised that... ...royalty should from the heart and not status. In that status Chandni is a queen of hearts. Come on, darling. Give me a hug. Sorry, dear. I am very sorry. So I have decided that... ...I will get Veer married to Chandni in Punjab with grandeur.
