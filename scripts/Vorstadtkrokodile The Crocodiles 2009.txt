But what will we do if he falls off? Duck! The pendants are at the top. If you get it, you're in. Yes, keep going Hannes! Shit! Great. Ah! - Hannes, come down from there now! Yes, Hannes dear, get down! You are still so little! - Little? How stupid of you! - Is that how do you talk to your boss?. Whoever wants to be a crocodile, must go up. - I don't have to. As Olli's sister... - Get him or I'll tell Dad, that you secretly surf the web. - And I'll tell mom about the lipstick. - No more homework! - No more gummi bears. Sisters! Shut up, Frank! Good, that's a girl. - I'm up! - You see. Totally harmless. - Ah! Spazzo, take it easy! This is so dangerous! Sorry. - Get him! - He is on the roof, that's the goal. Now he's a crocodile! Ah! - Not good! - Help! - Maria, call the fire department. - Help! - No connection! I'm going to town! - Help me! Help! Olli, look out, the ladder! - Ah! Help! Mom? Dad! Is this the fire department? Someone's hanging from the roof of the brick factory! Help! Ah! - He's coming down. - Everyone take cover. - Help! - Frank, wait. Ah! Ah! Help! Mom? I just can't. I'll call back. - You got through? Help! Ah! Oh god. Well, come on. I'm so glad nothing happened to you. Howls? Why? Because my mom doesn't call as much as yours? You dim wit! Who shit into your brain? Who are you? - We are the crocodiles. - The suburban crocodiles! Bye. Hello. Oh, you're a superhero. Oh, oh. - I'm back! - Mom! How was it at the store? - Like usual. - Many customers? - Not for us. Will you look for a well-paying job after graduation? Then you could always pay the rent. If we don't run off back to Grandma's again. - Bon appetit. - Bon appetit. Did you do something special today? Me? Ah... no. Why? - I spoke with Mrs. Koschmieder next door. - Oh yes. Something happened. The fire department brought me home. - Did you call the Fire Department? - No. Is your skateboard broken and did you hitch a ride home? - No. Is it better if I don't know why? I'll wash up. And do ironing for a week. If I work all day, I need to know... that you're not up to no good. Is that asking too much? - No. Take care of yourself. Otherwise I'll no longer have a man around. - Yes. I'll do that. Look, now I'm the crocodile. Ah, ah! These are Grandma's best dishes! I'll do it. I won't even stumble. - What is that? - It came today, darling. - I won't go to the special school! - Special School for the Disabled. It'll be easier access for you there. - I have 158 friends. For SZV students there are computer things. - Still 157 more than you But they're not here. They can't look out for you. - Mom, my hair! - Look, we'll make a deal: If you make friends by the end of holiday, who respect you in school, just one. Otherwise, you'll probably be better off at the school for the physically disabled. Unlike you, I'm fine being alone. If you have no friends at holiday's end, we'll try the special school. Until then, I have 10 friends! Does Kai Wolermann live here? - Yes. I would like to have a word. - Yes? - Yes. Nice. Kai. - Darling? - Leave me alone! I'll get him. - What do you have there? - What do you want? You got the fire department. I wanted to say thanks. - Then just say it. - I did. How did you see it? At night, I'm a superhero, you know? - Sure. Once again, thank you. And a speedy recovery. "A speedy recovery"? I have a telescope. It cost 200 euros. Are you a peeping tom or something? - Astronomer. But I'd like to be an astronaut. I see. Astronomers find my great grandma well. The also read horoscopes and such. Cool. Are you rich or something? - No. But I always get what I want. I can even lend it to you. - We have no television. I prefer to play outside. - On the roofs? Schni-Schna-Schnappi-fanclub? - We're the crocodiles. That is our club mascot. - Slimy, small, almost extinct. In other words: courage, strength and honesty. But you understand nothing. Can I join in? Maybe I'll learn something. The spaz? No way! Should we build an escalator? He can't even stand lookout. - Or run away. Unless it's on a downhill. Okay, that's sort of funny. If I had fallen from the roof, I might be in a wheelchair. Then you'd get kicked out! Handicaps should keep to themselves. - It's called "physically disadvantaged. " Then Frank is also disadvantaged. He's at a physical disadvantage! Shut up or you'll be physically disadvantaged too! We'll vote: Who wants you to bring along the cripple? - I do. Me too. - Did he give you money to do this? I'll explain it to you if you'd grow up. - Two vote in favor. Who's against it? So, the cripple is rejected again. Basketball? - My second broken bone this year. Wheelchair basketball with brittle bones? Not so cool. - Better than rugby. Wait a minute. Something shattered. - Well, not me. buy a house on Crete. With picturesque views, a garden... And you'd have closets. With shoes, clothes and stuff. - Maria needs that stuff, not I. What do you mean? - You're a typical boy. So with your clothes and stuff. - What? I think it suits you. - Slug. He's just a crush, the bird. - He is not, you moron! Hey! Cripple alert. Hi. - Bye. Bye. - Wait! I saw the break-in. Really? Were the police told? - No. If Mom finds out that I can't sleep, I'll have to see a doctor. Did you recognize anyone? - One had a camouflage jacket. I know where they go. I'll tell you, but take me along to your meeting place. Bye. Finally! - Sorry, but I've gotta go. Wait! Kai saw the break-in. - Hello? He's lying! What are you doing in our tree house? - Shut up, you child. Yes! You child! - Junior, why's your phone off? Sorry, it's broken. - Just tell us, my old man. We're having a little party. - I'll clean up before dad comes. Right. The last time there was the stench of beer. - That's obvious. And as a reward we had to clean the new car... spotless. So would you like to, huh? - I don't need any penis enlargement. Penis enlargement. Look at the pisser! Say again, are you nuts? - Be careful what you say, fuckface. Olli. - Sh! Do you still think I need a penile enlargement? - Yes! Are you suicidal... - He doesn't mean it! Shut up, fatty! Olli, Olli. At your age I had a big mouth. But eventually I learned to to respect my elders. They can hurt you. Especially when you least expect it. If you're alone. - Crocodiles are never alone. Never. Sweet little ones. Really wild. - Wild, wild. We get pissed off then begin to howl. - Yes, exactly. Howl. - Howl, children. Howl! Howl! Man, are they stupid? Shit. I need to clean up the house. - Right before CSI. Then we'll meet here again tomorrow. See you later, alligator. Cool. Rocket engine. Hey, big guy. Well? What did you order for your racer? Chiptuning, low side panels, rocket-turbo. The usual. Quite the father. Have a look here, I've brought something. Wow. With steel spikes. - Of course. Tell me, isn't that too dangerous? - It will build strength. The doctor certainly said he should play sports. What did I tell you, you ass? You may not drive the Sprinter! That could cost me my job! - Yes... Now I'm talking to you! Man! The green belongs to me! Bah! Olli! Man, you're disgusting. - What is it? Do you think I want to eat your slobbery gummi bears? You wanted the green one. - But not from your mouth! Idiot! Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Here! Mom! Mom, are you okay? Wha... - They've invaded the store. It was ransacked I was still in there. Then I wanted to get out and then to have the... Well, shit. Then I'd call the police. Soon it'll be 8. You need to go register for the exam. Nah, the police must come. - Until then, you're stuck. Forget it. To recoup the losses, I must work through the whole month. That's not fair! Did you study for years for that! I can help you somehow. I could help out more around here. Or catch the burglars and collect the reward. That is sweet of you, but you're still too small. Too small? We're a team, Mom! You take your examination I'll stop pestering you. Yes, but... - No but! I'm a crocodile. I fell 10 meters off the roof. I'm not too small! I do not always have to wear the clothes my cousin has. I'd like time to go on vacation, like other kids. I like time to do things with you. That will only happen if you earn more. Please, sign up for the exam. I don't need long. I promise. Can you go the way the firefighters took on the way back. Go faster. Kai here. - Hannes here. You know where the burglars are, right? Am I the all-knowing? Of course! - Tell me. Then I'll take you to the crocodiles. - I do not know if I have time... Ok, just for you. Let's say, Wednesday? - Let's say in a half an hour? Okay. That'll work. - Bye Did you find my headset? - Surely it was burned. Really? It's a gift from my Mom! - Don't blubber around and pick up! I found a small TV! Great, Jorgo. Really great. This is your hiding place? Pretty fucked up. What does he want here? - To take a look. Are we a hospital? - Only we're allowed to see the quarters! Right now there aren't any quarters. - Shut up, smartass. What happened? - Frank's brother burned everything. Or the taliban from the ghetto. The gypsies. Or your family, Jorgo. I'm not a gypsy! - Let's find someplace new. Ecologically speaking, a tree house isn't acceptable. - Yes, and where? The players are always the great ones. - No, there better not be. How about the old bridge? - The bums have their camp there. The old brick factory! - Who's asking? He's coming along. - He's a spaz! He saved my life! - Exactly. Kai earned it! When Jorgo wanted to join, at first we were all against it. - What? But now we like him. Is someone still against it? Well, then Kai comes with us. People! He can sit and watch from there. - As an observer. Anyone have another idea? Olli, Frank and I hold him and Mary, you fold up the wheelchair. And if you drop him? - Then I'd still be paraplegic. We'd all go to jail for that. Nah. Parents are responsible for their kids. They'd go to jail. Okay then. Wow. - Cool place. Like an Athenian ruin. This is a definite danger of collapse. Frank and I will look up on top. Jorgo and Elvis, check the front. Peter und Maria, you check the back. Hannes will look after our guest. Bah! Are you sure that the front is alright? I'm disabled, but not blind. Abandoned. I see how to get there. Maybe the burglars are still here. - No, they'd probably come at night. Hannes. - Maria. What are you doing here? Peter's getting his helmet. Because of the danger of collapse. - I see. That thing looks pretty rotten. - Oh, I know all about ladders. Look, totally stable. Shit! Run!. - This way! The rail! You're underneath the rail. Get out! Hannes, I'm stuck! Faster! You have to to get away! Take off the shoe. - I can't! Hurry up! Go! - Go! Hannes! Please! Do it! - Watch it! Hannes, quick! Maria? Hannes? Shit. - They're supposed to be dead. Nonsense! Don't talk such shit, man! Jorgo, call the fire department. - Alright. Dortmund Emergency, hello. - A margarita with extrasharp salami. What, emergency?. 'Scuse me, am foreigner, I miss-dialed. You're full of shit sister. - Like always, stop it. People? Maybe you want to check underneath this one time. Radical! Ancient. What is that? Crazy. Olli, open up. - It's locked up, man. Come, let me see. - Whoa! What is this worth? - More. Much more. - A million? A 1000 euro reward for finding the burglars. Burglar? Here? Conti Road-Attack treads. New! - Hey, Indiana Jones, what's with them? Standard tires. Almost every car has these. But these are really cool. - Ok, I'll go to the police. You? We all found the compound. - The reward is open to everyone. If the cops lie in wait, they'll be warned, and stay out of sight. Then we have to catch them ourselves. The treads are a good trail. - Yes. We need to find the things. We'll observe the suspects. And if they strike, we'll grab them. - And how? We'll follow them with the wheelchair? - The goods must be back on sale! One moment. I've seen it on CSI. Uh-oh, she's looking. Do you have to piss too? - Nope, I can manage. We won't watch either. - I don't need to. You sweat it out or what? - We could lift you up. This is still a long day without a toilet. - How long? I mean, what do you mean by that? If I get pissed on, I'll flip out. Will you get it out for him? - With which hand then, you bum? Once it's out, I need somebody to pound on my belly. Reflex discharging. Peter, come for the reflex discharge and get Kai's dick out? W... w... what? Okay, volunteers. Oh man, guys! You touched him! - What of it? It's just a pecker. Maria? I think Hannes must also have an emergency. Oh. Babies! Ok, I printed out the profiles. Bye. See you later. - See you later. Hey, you skulker! What are you doing here? Hey! I got here late again. R... R... Run! Get out! - This way! Run! Olli! Get out! Were you at the Pimp-my-wheelchair? - Hide! Hide! Gone! Watch it. - I don't know her. You look around. Now they're looking over here. Act disabled. Go! - And how should I act like that, you bum? We pissed them off. They're gone. Hey. You there. Yes, I mean you! You can't take your chair here across the grass. I would much rather walk. - Wait a minute. Look at the grooves! Do you know what the grass costs? - Are the disabled banned around here? Just because he's in a wheelchair, he's not allowed to play here? I don't understand. - Let's translate it to you, Maccaroni! I'm not Italian! - I don't care! Can we play here if we use crutches? - Of course. But that makes a lot of animal holes. You see. The grass gets ruined. Listen up, you Dobbes! What is the matter with you? You probably took your bath too hot? Clear out, fast! - Go away. Do your own shit. - I couldn't care less about that shit. Hold on! You can't leave me here alone with the handicapped! I'm not coming. Help out! - Yes, all kinds of time. What is this shit? Take your time, boy! Did you break something? - Nothing happened. There's abuse of the physically disadvantaged! He is nothing here. I'm giving you a free ticket. For the whole year, okay? I want eight of them. - Hi, this is the police? One moment. Wait. - You dirty little blackmailers. No, please go. Hi, Mom. Yes, we've been joking around. Yes, joking around. If you must laugh. - Respect. That was pretty casual. Not bad for a cripple. - Should we take you home? Nothing will happen to me. - See you tomorrow. See you later, alligator. After a while, crocodile. Guys, how does it look? Small international match against the Albanians? Yes, exactly! An international match! Pass the ball! Conti attack treads. Camouflage. Hey! Go! Hey, Frank, help me. Thanks. Isn't that painful? This is music! - A super ringtone for you, Jorgo! It sounds like you on the toilet! - You've got no taste in music. Welcome to the new headquarters! - Yes! This belongs to one of the dealers in the city. The profile fits. The Rocker's wares! - Do they have the treads as well? Nah. But they followed us. - He was angry over a motorbike! That's from the three guys. The profile fits. Motocross bikes. One of which was brand new. And one had a camouflage jacket in a backpack. So one jacket says it all. Quickly now! Make way! Be right back. - What? Hannes! Do you know how awful for me this is? Yes. Tomorrow, 3 pm. Shit. Hey! Old man, what's a Mongoloid doing here? Spazzo, what are you doing here? Going for a run. Tell no shit, pickled herring. - Yes, pickled herring. You rolled all the way here alone? Without mom without dad? Without Mom, without Dad! - He's one of us. Check out the toads. What are you doing here you little turtles? No trespassing. Can't you read? - As well as you can. You're pissing us off. I'll give you two minutes. Two minutes, yes. - Or what? Or what? I don't know... - Leave him alone! Or I'll tell Dad that you took the Sprinter again. You wouldn't do that. - This is your brother? Hey, little boss! You're showing yourself to be a shit! Not! - Leave it! Then leave, old man. Want to dance? Dance on! - Leave our cabin in peace! Hannes! Leave it. Come here! Be careful, he's coming! That was a third time, Dennis! If I catch you here again, I'll make you into croc' skin bags. Is that clear? Is that clear? K... h... - It's clear. Okay then. Come on, Achmed. - Heh! W... w... we could build a new hut at the old mill. What would Dennis have wanted here? He would have stopped to look around. Like us. - With the Sprinter? We should call the police. That's my brother! Do you get that? You're not calling anyone! Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd got strung out and no one supported him. But the band held a place for him till the end. Is that how it goes in German too? - I don't want to diss Dennis. And the reward? - Fuck the reward! Frank is a German, But still our brother. And since Dennis is his brother, we're all quasi brothers. Theoretically. But I have the same jacket seen at the break-in! Everyone has a jacket like that! - The tire tracks are identical! We still know nothing! The cripple thinks he's important with his fictional stories! Let him drool on himself, since he can handle everything on his own. He's no longer a crocodile. He's just a fucking cripple! These were in the Sprinter. From my mom's shop. Dennis bought that. - And the 10 others in the Sprinter? Liar! I got it! Your brother is an ass! A burglar! - What do you mean? Olli, say something! - Hey, man! Frank is one of us. Dennis is a spaz, but not a burglar. - He is guilty! We can't accuse him without evidence! - How much do you need? Then I'll go alone to the police. - Crocodiles stick together. Always! If you implicate Dennis, you're out! - My mom has no more coal. We have nothing to eat. If I don't have the 1000 euros tomorrow we'll have to move away again. - Nobody wants you here anyway! Traitor! Maybe they'll get some other justice. We have really don't have enough evidence. Maybe he's really not guilty. - Are you stabbing me in the back? First, you blackmailed me so I'd take you with me when I didn't want to. And now you're backing them. - Hannes, this isn't against you. Nah, sure. Maybe it would be better for me if I moved away. Maybe I'll find true friends. Hannes! Hannes, wait! - Mom is really right. You can rely on no one except yourself! We want you to help! - Who is "we"? You and the crocodiles? Do you believe they'll still be interested in you tomorrow? We can't do anything with you! We brought you in only so that we can find the burglars! You can go right back home! No one here needs you anymore! Kai, where were you? - It's still not dark. Why didn't you call? We worried! - I forgot. You're all wet! You're hypothermic. You know how dangerous that is. I'm okay! Don't you have something else to do other than sit around and worry? Other mothers have jobs. Or friends for coffee. They have no children with disabilities, who are so dependent on them. I finally figured it out. I'm dependent on no one. And certainly not on you. Leave it! Don't you have other shit to do? Ironing or something? Do you have to stand here and stare at me? I'm coming alone. Well, are you a crocodile? - Well, are you a nerd? What about you? Have you made a mess or why are you in such a good mood? No, I'm not making any more messes. - 'Scuse me, you're a real adult. How exactly is it going in your club? - Good. Cool. It's really fun. Nice. I'm glad that you have found friends. You, Mom? - What is it, my big guy? Good luck with the test tomorrow. Thank you. But instead wish me lots of customers tomorrow. Otherwise I have to work tomorrow, so we can scrape the rent together. Or will you nab more criminals and claim the reward? - I will. Do you have gummi bears? Get them for yourself. Do you have a broken heart, or what? Shut up, Olli. You must stop them! Yo, Albanians do you want to play? - Yes. Who ratted? You have to tell me, who ratted on us! Was it you? Are you crazy? Are you stupid? How can you ask me that old man? Go away. Do it for your country! Don't we all want to take a trip together tomorrow? Once again, to the zoo? - No. Something cool. Dad, if you suggest it, it's automatically uncool. The old brick factory on the outskirts will be demolished tomorrow. - What? Wow, what? Like in a film. Boom! Isn't that dangerous? Don't we need to be evacuated? For you everything is dangerous. A bit of fun is essential! After your last "fun" with Kai he was paralyzed. - Mom! Then keep him locked up! In the house, where you can watch him constantly. In the special school, there's constant supervision. Then perhaps he'll be happy. Like you! That was really shitty of you. One more shit in our lives. That doesn't matter, right? Dortmund. The Old Brick Factory is to be demolished next Monday. The old factory stood for 14 years, unused by Company Olbracht GmbH & Co. KG. Now, there's a new housing project to be built on the property. Hey, driver! Well, how are you? - Hm... and you? It's okay. Someone said some shit about us. - Really? Yes! You, cripple! Admit that you snitched about seeing us. Yes, that you snitched about seeing. Would I like to leave. Listen! - Understand? In other words we weren't there. - Are you nuts? Watch where you look, understand? - Did you understand? Hey, little fatty, is everything clear? You got the melon huh? - Melon. Sorry. Hello. May I? My helmet! Stop! Make way! Make way! Make way! Make way! Hi, guys. Watch out! Ah! Kai! Hey boy, what are you doing? Shit. Are you okay? I can't feel my legs anymore. - He's hit him! Perhaps they were the burglars. - That's enough. We'll show the pigs. And Frank? - We'll tell you afterwards. We didn't want to inform on Dennis! - So all without any evidence. We'll only say where the goods are. - And the reward? We're at war. The police will surely find DNA or microfibers from clothes. That will reveal who the perpetrators are. F... f... fully CSI-like. Your pendant, so that the cops know that you belong to us, Hannes. We want to file a report. - Due to theft. Sit down, wait, and shut up. Yes, yes, yes. Our fire department. I'm on my lunch time. So! Where is your teacher? - Why? Because we have important things to do such as investigating sandwich thefts. We're on holiday and are on the trail of a real case. You're probably the 7 question marks, huh? - We're the crocodiles! We have evidence to apprehend the burglars! - That's nice! They already took everything we had. Here. There were... The Albanians. - What? Not the Albanians! I'm not Albanian. We found part of the booty with them. - The fingerprints really match? There are witnesses, you smartass! And so for me the case is closed. I'm taking a break now and as for your club: Get out! - What about the reward? Reward? The capture was done by the three motorbikers! They gave us the tip. And no one else. The Albanians weren't the ones! - One can't prove anything to them anyway. Nonsense. The don't even speak German. They can't defend themselves. They'll simply be deported. - We'll prove they weren't the ones. We must catch the real burglars. - And how, Zorro Jr.? We'll catch them at the hideout. - We don't know when they'll be there. True. The brick factory is being demolished. - No! Not again, our new hut. Early tomorrow. So you have only one night. Mother, please. Don't shout like that, I hear you! Did he find friends yet? - No, of course not! What is it now? - What do I know? Sure, he spends all day somewhere and claims... - Good day. Peace. - I've taken off my shoes. Hello! They come through the old factory driveway. You can see that easily from up here. I'll observe them with the telescope. - I'm right there. They come to the back entrance and drive straight to the camp. Here. As proof we need the photo as they evacuate the camp. - I'll do that. From there, one has a good view. - I'll help you. Well? Do you play Legos? Nice. It's a simple plan to use imagery to solve a crime. - Ah. Then I'd better operate quietly in case we're bugged, right? Close the door? - Yes. Gladly, dear. One will be watching the Sprinter. - Definitely Achmed. We must disable the Sprinter so that he can't escape. - And how? Remove the keys? That's what Peter and I will do. - I? Previously, we had to lure Achmed. Otherwise, he'd hit you. I'll do it. I already know how. - Good. Jorgo: telecommunications. You and Kai, you oversee the operation. If we get the photo, the vehicle is turned off, and the gang is locked up... you call the cops. Any questions? Are you going already? - Yes, but we'll come back. If our cabin blows up tomorrow we'll need new quarters. Bye. o... o...! Ow! Hey! Man, Olli. Sister... Good luck tomorrow. Hi. - Shh! Hi. Elvis. Hello! Open up!. Hello. Hey. Password? - Open up already, you spaz! Sorry, that's not the password. Password: "S... A... save the Albanians. " Maria: channel 1 Olli: channel 2 Hannes: Croc-cam. If you press "Page All" it broadcasts on all channels. So be careful. Kai and Hannes: get in position. Now we get the pisser ready. What do you mean, how deep is it? - Deep enough. It doesn't look so rotten. - I know my way, believe me. Sorry I was so mean to you yesterday. It's not necessary. I was selfish to not have thought about you. Already forgotten. What really happened to your legs? I was shopping with Dad. We messed up. He was pushing me in a shopping cart. Total childish. Oh well. He stumbles, wants to hold onto the cart and doubles its momentum. And I'm in the cart which hits the railing. The cart stops, I went flying and landed on a handle in the gardening tools. Ouch. - Yes. Complete paraplegia. Still, only the 11th vertebra. Otherwise I couldn't even piss. Your father is a real shit. It was just stupid. It wasn't intentional. Mine cleared out shortly after my birth. No wonder. With such a son. My parents were still young when I arrived. It was too much for them. Do you believe that one can rely only on himself? Could be. Is there a chance that you could walk again sometime? No. No matter. I play basketball while sitting, and I can also be an astronaut. In weightlessness no one can walk. If you need a co-pilot for the Space Shuttle, just call. I will. Hey, you Spazzes! Do you have tomatoes in your eyes? Shit. Croc 1 in position 1. Activity at the back entrance. Crocodile eyes in position. Is the battery charged? Then I'll use the flash. Power it down! Phase 1 in 3.. 2... 1. What was that? Achmed, what was that? - No idea. Then look, you bird! - Yes, exactly, you bird! Yes, you Blondies. He's getting close. - More gas. Team Sprinter on the road. Grab underneath and up high. Hey, Achmed! Help me carry this! I need their faces closer. - I'll come too. No. That's too dangerous, baby. "Baby"? "Baby"... Crocodile eye moving in closer. - To where exactly? To the burglars! Kevin, get there faster. Come on! Come. O... Olli. K... Key. Shit. Lights out. Someone's coming. Old man! What are you doing here? - I texted him a message. And what are you doing here? - Here. Look. That's... That can't be. That's really Dennis. Dad has told him so often he shouldn't take the car. This means trouble. I'm sorry, really. Previously, he was somehow more there for me and all. If he goes to jail, you've still got us. We're also your brothers. I... I have no idea. Seen by "Two steel-hearted p... p... pros. " What? Shit. What are you doing? Hey, everything okay? - Sh... Shit, man! D... Diesel. Now I have you, young crocs. You've made Uncle Achmed angry. If I find you, I'll bite you all in the ass. I'm coming now! Ah! Hey, guys. Help me out of here! Quick, help me out here. What's happening now? Hey! There he is. Did you see him? - Yes. Just you wait, you pisser. I'll defeat you! They're following Hannes. - Shit. Jorgo, call the police. Jorgo! - Yes! Shit, I crashed. Do it! Quickly! - Calm down. This has happened before! Holy shit. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? Make a face! Give me the camera. - Camera? You should give me the camera! Yes, exactly! The camera! - Give it to me instead! Laying hands on us is the last thing you'll do. The cripple again? - Hannes, call the police. Enough is enough. - Stay standing. The penis and the cripple want to give me orders? Say cripple to me once more. You don't dare, cripple. Holy shit! The cripple shot me in the leg! - Don't say cripple again! Hello? Here is Hannes Burgmller. This is an emergency. Come quickly! "Hello? Hello, where are you?" I'll finish you off. - Leave him alone. I warned you, cripple. Don't you grab at him. You shall not call him that! Crocodiles, grab him! - Yes! Yes! - Let me through. Ok. Ok! You have won. You have won! What do you want? Do you want a DVD player? A game console? Yes? - You leave us in peace today. Don't come back to our hut! - You exonerate the Albanians! You give Mom back her things! - Dennis! The cops! That can't be! They could never be here so quickly. Never underestimate a Greek and his cell phone. Drive! Well. Out of gas. Stupid running around. - Well done. So, that's it! Search and arrest them. Back to the station, come on. Here comes another one! Arrest him! By the way: The "one can rely only on himself"... Yes? That is totally garbage. Attention! Only 2 minutes till demolition! One stupid comment about the clothes, and I'll punch you out. For me? A hand bike! The goods have been recovered. Mom no longer needs coal. Elvis can't push you to school every day. After this everyone knows who he's with and not to say "spaz". He didn't climb to the roof but still met the goal. - Now he's a crocodile! And? - Well, that's all good. I'm done with the shitty job. I passed. - You are so cool! No, you. You are the coolest son, that one could wish for. Without you I'd be screwed. I am so proud of you, my big guy. - Oh, Mom. Cry me a river. The world offers more than just phones and action films. You'll learn that one day. Please note that we are far away! The demolition will commence in 10... I believe in you.
