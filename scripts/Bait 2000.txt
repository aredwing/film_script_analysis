Status check, please. All secure. Excellent. Carry on, gentlemen. - Come on. Come on!|- What're you doing, man? All right. All right, we're here. What restaurant is this?|Where the front door at? We go in the back.|It's like VIP, you know? Only cool people go in the back,|like Madonna... and Dennis Rodman|and Gary Coleman. It's real controversial stars|coming in this place. All right. I'm not doing it. All we gotta do is knock this off. We'll get a couple of grand.|I been casing this joint for months. Look. You been casing it|and got one picture? Film is expensive. Look at that. Shrimp? You on parole and you here|trying to go back for stealing shrimp? Not shrimps, baby. Prawns. What the fuck is a prawn? A prawn is bigger than shrimp. You|ever order a jumbo shrimp cocktail? And they real big|like they been working out? Like they on steroids?|That's prawns. Eating one prawn,|that's like five or six shrimp. Yeah, right.|I'm going back to the truck. Fredo did the same thing to Michael|in The Godfather. "Fredo, don't ever go|against the family. Don't disrespect me and my father.|Get the fuck out here!" You're deviating. Give me a second. We don't have a second. Go back to the truck. I'll finish up here. Glove. Ninety seconds. Perfect. Send down the lift. Yeah. I don't think so. What? What are you talking about? The first conversation that|we ever had. No fucking guns! You listen to me, Jaster. You send down that fucking lift! - Fuck you, you freak show!|- What are you doing? No! Wait. Wait! Crazy motherfucker! No! Stop! ...frigid weather conditions|continue to pound the New York area. You fucking nuts? No. I'm fine. Thanks for your concern. - What the hell is wrong with him?|- Hold on. He's really disrespecting|my speed right now. He's about to bite me in the ass.|Disrespecting your speed? Where the hell they get a Doberman? Where's a nice, slow rottweiler|when you need him? You cased it for months|and didn't see a 200-pound dog? They was puppies when I saw them.|All right. On three, you go right, I'll go left. Fuck that. I go wrong all the time.|I'm going right. Okay, brother, whatever. One, two, three, break out. Gotta hurry.|Yeah, what you want now, huh? One-on-one.|It's me and you, baby. Me and you. Well, it can just be you.|It can just be you. How long does it take to|get these out of development? Because, you know, I been working|on my little portfolio. You're lucky I pulled my hamstring. Y'all would still be chasing me. You're saying that your partner|was a midget on a skateboard? Midgets is taking over. They took|over this playground where I live. They got this whole little|midget underworld. It's crazy. They squeezing us out because|they selling everything half-price. I'm innocent, yo. Oh, innocent, huh? Man, if you didn't have a gun,|I'd whup your ass. Where'd you get this then, huh?|A cocktail party? - What do you got?|- We got nothing. Both shot in the back of the head,|execution-style. Could be a 9 mil or a.38.|I couldn't find any empty shells. They died about three hours ago,|I would say. All right, listen up. My name is Edgar Clenteen. I'm the chief investigator, Special|Projects Unit, U.S. Treasury Dept. This is my crime scene. And you all are contaminating it. We got two young men here... executed inside one of|the most secure rooms on earth. So whatever you find, I don't care|what it is, you bring it to me. I will not have anyone|fucking up this investigation. Now get out of here. Let Forensics do their work. Go on. Get out. I got one. We ran an AFIS match|on the fingerprint. John Delano Jaster, a heavy-equipment|operator with two prior felonies. - Where the hell do I find him?|- He's at Rikers. - Who's this?|- Well, who is this? John Jaster, asshole. You're in|my house. Put my wife on the phone. Oh, hey, Mr. Jaster.|Your wife stepped out. She told me to get the phone... in case this was you|and, you know, it was. Who are you? I'm just here fixing the heat. Is|there a number she can reach you at... or a message or something?|She has been worried sick about you. - You fix the heat, huh?|- Yeah, that's right. Let me tell you something. Lady said you'd never go for it, but|you'd save yourself a lot of grief... you put in a new thermostat. Don't worry about my thermostat.|Tell my wife that I'm in Rikers. Oh, you don't say? Just tell her to get her ass|down here and get me out. Don't worry about it, pal.|I'll be sure to tell her. Jerk-off. Oh, that was your husband. He wants you to get him out of jail. But you've had a difficult day. Why don't I do it? Good morning, sir. I'd better not be wasting my time. Wooly, what do you got? Jaster's in a holding cell|with an Alvin Sanders. Some guy they picked up on a petty|theft heist for stealing shrimp. - Shrimp?|- Shrimp. That's pure nerve gas. You can use|that shit for weapons and shit. You burned the hairs out my nose. I see why they arrested you.|They gotta protect the public. I'm sorry. I suppose|you smell like daffodils. You should be mad at your ass.|You and your ass should get a divorce. - I don't feel good.|- Well, that makes two of us. Did you eat some shit on a half shell?|Yeah, grunt. Get it out. See, that's...|Yo, what's up? What's up, man? It's my heart. Yo, guard!|We need a doctor in here right now! - What's up?|- The pills. Get the pills. Hold on. I'm coming, I'm coming. All right. All right, just relax.|You all right? I'm gonna get somebody|for you, all right? - Alvin.|- Yeah. - Is that your name?|- Yeah. You probably know me. The shrimp|heist, but it was actually prawns. - If I don't make it...|- Oh, come on with that. Can you just listen?|This is important. I need you to get|a message to my wife. Tell her... that she should go|to the Bronx Zoo. - Yeah. The Bronx Zoo. All right.|- Please. Tell her, "There's no place|like home". What about Toto... and, you know,|the yellow brick road? What kind of pills you taking? Are you through. You get that message to her. I'll make it worth your while. Cool, cool.|Now, what if you do make it? You still break a brother off?|I need some change in my pocket. Damn, he already shit all over... Hands over your head and don't move. Drag this piece of crap upstairs. Dude was already sick. He was about|to die. What's wrong with you? Don't treat him like that. Don't treat him|like an animal like that. Y'all push him around. If it was me,|I wouldn't take that bullshit. Are you a doctor? We're ready here, sir. You been working out, huh? Sir? Yeah, you better talk to him, boy. You lucky these bars here.|You don't know who you fooling... Okay, you coming back. I'll be right up here|getting my sleep. I'll whup your ass. You don't know who you just|grabbed up on. I'm a gangster. I see you coming. Come here where there's no light,|I'll whup you. You got your boys|with your billy sticks. I'm Alvin, baby, king of the seafood.|They know me around these corridors. Explain it to me, John. How do you steal 40 million in gold|and not have the cash to make bail? I don't know|what you're talking about. I'm out of aspirin. Could you get me some? Chewable. How'd it happen? How do you pull|the heist of the decade... and get busted for a DWl? What kind of man... goes out celebrating... after he pops two boys|in the back of the head? Look, I didn't.... You're not hanging that on me. They were on the floor... facedown. It was an execution, pure and simple. No guns, man. Look, I'm a contractor.|I'm no fucking shooter! Then who? Just give me the names. A name. It was just.... There was just one other guy.|It was me and him. - Bullshit. Bullshit!|- One guy. One guy! I swear it. Computer is what this guy's got. He's got the whole government wired. Who? Come on, Jaster, tell me who. Give me the goddamn name, Jaster.|Just give me a name. Please, listen to me. Get me a doctor. Get me a doctor. Please. - I'll give you a name.|- You're giving me a brain tumor. You give me a pass,|I'll give you the fucking gold! Nobody knows where it is|but me, you know. Did you burn your partner? I need a doctor. You took the gold|and left him there, didn't you? No wonder you drank. You figured|jail was the best place to lay low. Just keep pulling my chain... keep on with|with this happy horseshit... l'll make sure|you do need a doctor. - Ed?|- What, goddamn it?! I don't think he's faking. Damn, I was just trying|to have a good meal. Damn! And I just thought you had gas. Oh, shit. - What the hell?|- Get in there. Move it. You lucky. Oh, you lucky. Sit down, Alvin. Not there. Oh, yeah. Got reserved seats. Watching the game? Big screen. Hey, look, I apologize... about that irreverent shit|I displayed in the cell. I was out of line. I had been lifting weights... and I just got through doing curls,|so I was real tense. Hey, Alvin? I got some good news. And bad news.|Want to hear the good news? Yeah, I mean, good news is great. You're fucked.|Want to hear the bad news? I think you just told me the bad news. Unless you want to tell me|worser news. You're alone in a room with me. Yeah, right. So, what you want? You and.... You and Jaster were alone|in that cell for eight hours. All alone. You must have talked about something. His bowels. He was shitting and coughing|and it didn't smell good. How do you talk to somebody like that? - It's terrible.|- Alvin. I do this for a living. You think I can't see that|you're hiding something? Okay, everybody out. Alvin, think about Jaster... and tell me|where you want the bruises. You trying to try|some sneaky shit, huh? Gonna fool me with the quiet voice|while you beat on my body. You can do that,|but you can't beat on my soul. Do the words "Stokely Carmichael"|mean anything to y'all? Reverend Malcolm X?|Reverend AI Sharpton? I see you taking off your Timex. I ain't telling you shit nor|the brothers behind the aquarium. You can kiss my ass|with your tongue... and I will take|this information to my grave. The man said something|about the Bronx Zoo, okay? Well? We completed our search|of The World of Darkness. That would be your bats,|your leopard cats, your mole rats. We came up empty, sir. "There's no place like home". - It's gotta be a building.|- We checked them all. We checked the monkey house,|the reptile house, the giraffe house. Even the outhouse. We scanned the entire grounds|to a depth of 20 feet. This guy was|a heavy-equipment operator. Five minutes with a machine,|he could've buried the gold anywhere. So where does that leave us, sir? Square-fucking-one. Come on, let's go|check the outhouse again. Let's go. We have a national security crisis. Citadel 4 is the same system we use|to safeguard our nuclear facilities. This guy took it apart like|he was hot-wiring a Toyota. I'll give you the short version. We're talking world-class loner. A guy who spent literally tens|of thousands of hours at a computer... feeling around in the dark.|Nothing but math. Nothing but numbers. His sense of well-being, his very|sanity is predicated on completion. Only this time,|the equation is incomplete. He didn't get the 42 million in gold|he'd worked so very hard for. That's our edge. Now this.... This is what I need your money for. It's a BC-19. It's an experimental tracking device. Dr. Harris here can fill you in. Well, it's quite simple, really. The BC-19 has a proprietary signal... broadcast and location. It's got a 10-mile radius and|full satellite coordinate tracking. Now, the optimum placement site... is the temporal mandibular joint. It's just below the jaw. All right, look... we implant this in|the appropriate subject, put him... on the street, make it known|he knows where the gold is... and I guarantee that our elusive|computer whiz will show up. Who would be willing to have|that thing implanted in their jaw? Senator... we already have a volunteer. This is Howard Cosell. Down goes Frazier! Come on. Tenderize that bitch, Alvin. - What you got?|- I got all kinds of shit. Chest, chest, chest, nuts! What do you know about boxing? I ain't gotta box.|I get my skills from TV. I got Mike Tyson skills.|You biting me! My ears, my ears! I'll go Muhammad Ali on them. - That's cold.|- That ain't right. That ain't right. Once I get out of here, I'll get|my big score. I'll be set for life. I'll get me a 1-year-old Arabian. A 1-year-old?|What sick shit is that? I'm talking horses. Thoroughbreds.|They got royalty in their blood. - What you know about horses?|- I know everything. My father took me to the horse track. Taught me everything|about thoroughbreds. I'm teaching you awareness here.|See, I'm always aware. Stay aware of everything.|Are you watching? Watch my skills. I'm always aware. See my eyes?|I'm on a swivel. Can't nobody sneak up on you|and just get with you. That's... Mr. Clenteen, exactly how many laws|are we breaking here? You don't want to know. Ladies and gentlemen. You've all distinguished yourselves. You're all the best at what you do. Encryption. Hardware. Signal analysis. And as of this moment... nothing else in your lives exists. You no longer exist. Welcome aboard. Don't disappoint me. Sir, I'm in. All right, here we go. Case number 1411263. Subject: Alvin Dean Sanders. Former cellmate: John Delano Jaster. Released from Sing Sing prison Friday. Treasury surveillance|subcontract required. Pay-grade status approved. Split-shift overtime coverage. Contact Special Agent Vicks|at tspec.com. Ed, you actually think this guy is|surfing Treasury Department files? What if he can't decode this?|We can make a less secure encryption. Maybe we should indicate we think|Sanders knows where the gold is. Listen to me. I had a grandfather|who was a trapper by profession. Now he had two prices|on his card: wolf... and everything else. Now a wolf... will starve itself to death... rather than make a mistake. You have to lay down a scent|that smells real from far away. And the bait... has to be fresh|and untouched by human hands. And make no mistake about it... we are hunting wolf. Send the message. Voice recognition, please. Voice recognition, please. Bristol here. - All is well and good.|- Good morning, sir. Mainframe up, please. Mainframe boot sequence complete. System check, please. All systems are online. Let's see.... Overnights, please. Overnights loading from NSA... and Treasury Department|servers U.S. dot gov. Overnights loaded, ready for review. Where shall we start today? NSA, please. NSA loaded. A secret, huh? I love a secret. Alvin... do you feel like a lucky man? No. Yes.|Well, it depends on what you.... Of all the many crimes|that men commit... the worst punishment|is rewarded those... who squander their good fortune. - You're right, you're right.|- You understand me? No, sir. Mr. Sanders... you were arrested and booked... by a police officer|named Wayne Miller for... theft of shrimp. Well, you know,|actually they were prawns. You know the big jumbo shrimp|that's, like, at least a dollar... Six weeks ago,|in an internal investigation... Miller admitted to a dozen counts|of falsifying evidence. Son of a... Jesus. Thank God for people|that come forward. Needless to say, we've been petitioned|to repudiate the convictions. Repudiation is what... What everybody needs more of|is a little repudiation. Now, repudiation is....|Use it in a sentence. I have a short sentence|for you, Alvin. You walk. I'm back, baby! You miss me? I'm free! New York City, do you feel me? Okay, let's take it for a spin. Time code is locked.|Satellite uplink is sealed. Tracking is a go. Hey, yo, taxi! Yeah, where you going there? I'm trying to get to Queens. Jeez, that's bad for me. I don't go to Queens. What do you mean? I seldom get there.|Where is it? Copy that.|All right, guys, we're up. Checking sound levels.|Levels are stable, sir. Good. We have a visual? Air Unit, this is Mobile 1.|Confirming. We have a visual. Do you copy? Roger that. The bird has ears. Who is it? I hear you didn't pay your bill.|I'm here for your bills. - My mom ain't here.|- Just like you people. - Get your ass away from my door.|- Come out. What's up? - What's going down?|- What's happening, baby? - You escape?|- As a matter of fact.... Quit playing so much. You know|I got warrants and stuff around here. - They don't just let people go.|- They let me go. Well, that sound like some bullcrap. It wasn't. They can't hold me. I'm the man.|Alvin, king of the seafood. Oh, my God, Steven. Oh, my God.|My stomach hurts and I'm crying. What's wrong? Happy to be out? You a full-fledged criminal. Look.|It's like The Price is Right. That's right. That's right. Mom's still here, right? We live here now. Tell him, Stevie. "Tell me, Stevie". What is that? That's a Tika. We about to get married|when she gets that blood test. That's a bullshit test. You're just fucking with me. Yeah. - Make sure she gets all her shots.|- I'm gonna do that. Where'd you get all this? Julio and Ramundo cut me in|on a sweet Godfather deal. See, you cut Julio and Ramundo out. It's just me and you.|We back on the block. This guy's a real beauty. Are you surprised? I think I'll go... see my girl, Lisa. - Who?|- Lisa. That won't be pretty. What you mean?|She ain't been seeing nobody, has she? It ain't like I'm tripping|on the whole thing. I mean, not that I give a damn. They'll do what they do|and I'll do what I do. Right, that's how you are.|You ain't never been like... I'm gonna shower and run over. - Good seeing you, bro.|- Good seeing you. - She probably...|- You went crazy since.... I'll put my work in, though.|You my money. Who's Lisa? That's the girlfriend. They were living together. Lisa Hill, 27... assistant manager ofBook Stew,|a used bookstore in Soho. She also waits tables|at the Sunrise Lounge. There better not be nobody|in there either. I'm serious. If there is, and if he ain't big,|I'll put the boots to him. Put the boots on him. Hang on. You're early. You damn right I am. Oh, my God. Alvin? What up?|You going on a date behind my back? Fuck you, Alvin. That's music to my ears.|Where do you want it? The couch? You disappear for two years, then have|the nerve to ask about my life? Fuck you, Alvin. You mean, like really "fuck you"|fuck you? Like "motherfuck you"? Bad move, Alvin.|Can't be too jealous. - Turn around and walk out.|- I got you flowers. Oh, thank you. Now you can leave. You need to pump your brakes|and recognize that your man is home. So, what happened, Alvin?|You escaped? Yeah, we had to tunnel out.|It was terrible. They released the dogs. They caught|up with me and my whole crew. Harriet Tubman, Kunte Kinte.|Harriet don't move like she used to. The dogs was chewing all on her ass. You know what, I don't have time|for this random gibberish. There was a dirty cop|so they let me go. Congratulations. Now leave. You don't mean that. How come you didn't come see me?|You didn't write me or nothing. I was going to come see you.|I was gonna write you and tell... You wouldn't understand. I wouldn't understand? I don't|understand why we ain't celebrating. I'm out. I'm back home. Home? No, see, this is my house. I pay the bills, I pay the rent.|You pay...? Exactly. Excuse me. You're upset. Stevie was the one|behind the whole thing. I was on my way to church. The next thing I know, I'm stealing. Stevie? I don't remember hearing|anything about Stevie going to jail. Lisa, look at me. Do I look|like I've been in day camp? I been around hard-core criminals. I'd like something soft|up against my body. I'd like to have a home-cooked meal,|a hug from my woman. What about a table dance? - Prison has changed me.|- Oh, really? Yes, it has. And I'm ready|for responsibility. What is that? What do you think it is? A puppy, I hope. It's not a puppy. What you been doing since I been gone? What's going on? Sweetie. This is your son, Alvin. That ain't my son. You think I made it up? I don't know. I mean, how? How? That night,|after Stevie's birthday party. Yeah, we did and... wow. He don't really look like me.|He kind of chubby, ain't got no teeth. IKind of cute. Can I hold him? Don't be like that.|Can I hold my son? He calling for his daddy anyway. Please? I cannot believe this. Look at this! Doesn't it trip you out? Me and you, and the next thing|you know, we got this. It's like half and half,|I guess, you know. - He'll be a little player.|- He won't be a player. He's strong. Look at that grip.|Big old fella. I think he sprung a leak.|He kind of smells. Never mind, Alvin. I'm going to work. The babysitter|will be here in five minutes. Come on, Lisa. Just give me another chance.|I'll get out there, I'll get a job. Take care of myself.|I'll take care of you. We got a whole little family.|Don't squeeze me out of that. You know, Alvin,|it's been really hard. I know. It's hard for everybody. Okay, but you gotta prove yourself. - You gotta get a job.|- I'll get that. - Stay out of jail.|- I don't remember how to get to jail. And stop dressing like a thug. I'll get a new Versace, Gucci. Maybe I'll consider... - Making love to your man?|- Having dinner with you. You'll like the way I cook.|While I was in there, taught me how. I can cook you anything. French. Bon giorno.|I can cook ltalian. Ciao, bella. Or I can cook, like, soul food. "Daisy, check your greens.|They done spoiled now". - Goodbye, Alvin.|- Can I get a kiss? - Goodbye, Alvin.|- All right. Take it easy. - Lisa?|- Yes? What's my son's name? - His name is Gregory.|- Gregory. Gregory. G-Dog! That's all right. That's your daddy. I think old Alvin just|might make it this time. Alvin Sanders is bait. That's all he is. When he's served his purpose... when he draws our man|out of the shadows.... Well, you know what happens to bait. Well, well, well. Decoding complete. Sequence complete. Look at this shit. Clown. Sushi chef. Male exotic dancer. That might be all right. What's cracking? Yes, I'm looking|for a Mr. Alvin Sanders.

Does your mother know|what you do for a living? That's real funny. Watch your head. I think I know why Stevie didn't show. I think he set us up. The minute we make bail, he's dead. Him and his brother, Alvin. All right, I want every agent|working around the clock... to keep this joker|out of the morgue and out of jail. He doesn't get so much|as a parking ticket or a hangnail. From now on, Alvin Sanders|leads a charmed life. Come on, come on. Alvin. Alvin, it's late. I know, but I really need|to talk to you right now. I got this for Gregory. - An egg?|- It's supposed to be magic. Anyway, he can't swallow it. Can I come in? Just for a minute? All right, but keep it down. - The baby's sleeping.|- All right. Did I ever tell you|that I had a very happy childhood? - That's not what Stevie says.|- Stevie. Dad used to pick me up every day|to take the cargo train to Manhattan. Go to the horse track.|I knew it really well. I know. Your dad trained horses. Not really. No. No, he was a.... He was a groom. I lied about that. But he was a great groom.|With the thoroughbreds, he was magic. I say he was the best.|But, you know, job didn't pay shit. So, therefore, our Christmases,|we didn't get jack shit. Which really pissed him off. One day he just went to this toy store|and just stole all these toys. Robbed them. Brought the toys over to the crib. I was like, "Damn, Santa Claus|got the wrong address or what?" So I'm bouncing from toy to toy|like I'm some kind of drunk dude. Mom's smiling. My father's smiling. It's all good, right? Then around 8:30, cops show up. Take the toys, take my father. But for about two and a half hours... l had a very, very happy childhood. Why are you telling me all this? Because I love you. Talk about a bunch of crap. It's all in his file, sir.|It's all true. He knows so much,|why not get a job at the track? He's had a record since he's 14.|Can't work there with a record. Oh, they all got sob stories. He's just trying to get laid. What you use on your skin?|It's so soft. - You feel that?|- Oh, yeah. You feel so good. - What's that smell?|- It's mango. Mango. Oh, mango! And some pineapple. Oh, shit. Who is he? All right, I'm gonna go to Starbucks|and get a Mango Grande. - Mocha.|- Mocha Cappuccino. Who is it? Registered letter for Alvin Sanders. - Who's it from?|- Uncle Sam. Damn. I just got out, man.|Why you bugging me? I know my rights. It says in the Constitution|on page 53, "We the People... in order to keep shit straight..."|Quit messing with me. I think it's a check. Good afternoon. Where l... Let me see where I sign. I don't ever get no checks. I was about to go postal on you. No|pun intended. I know all about it. Y'all do it for real and everything.|You make the news... All right. Apologies from the federal government,|$5000? Guess it's your lucky day. Hey, man, tell Uncle Sam|he cool with me, man. Apology accepted. Tell him he can come through|anytime he want to. Five G's. I'm up in there! - I'm up in there!|- Sir? You think maybe we gave him too much? Let's just hope this keeps him|out of trouble for a couple weeks. Excuse me, Afrikanic soul sister,|but do you have the book: Butt-naked in the Forest,|But Does Anybody Hear Me? What are you doing here? What? I'm here to see you. Listen, I got great news. You found a job! No, no, not yet. But I got something better than that. You said things would|be different this time. Things are very different.|Look at this. I got a check from the government|for $5000. The government gave you $5000.|All right, tell me anything. The government gave me a check.|I signed it over to you. What the fuck is he doing?|That's our money he's giving away. Actually, it's taxpayer money. I could give you this money.|It'll pay for some of the things... like the back rent.|Some of the money I borrowed... Like the stereo you sold. - I sold the stereo?|- Or the VCR you took. - I took the VCR?|- The blender my mama gave me. The blender was cheap. I didn't get|that much money for the blender. I'm not taking it, Alvin. I don't think you understand. I been trying to get a job.|It's hard right now. That's a lot of money.|I think you need it more than I do. Take some money|and get Gregory something. Get him platinum baby pieces|or something like that, you know. He'll probably be a little rapper. - No, maybe he's gonna be a doctor.|- Why would he want to do that? Doctor's great. I was thinking...|You thinking like I'm thinking. Just take the money. Get him|some toys. Say it's from his father. Alvin, honestly, have you really|been trying to find a job? I have been out there.|You sound like my mom. I want you to get this money.|Go get you a nice dress. We can kick it. I can romance you.|Look at your brown eyes. Now, come on. Get back to work|before we both be out of work. Okay, step. Thank you. Sorry, my man. Don't mention it. Now what do we do? Simple. We give him more money. You sure that's necessary?|He 's trying to change. He 'll never change. We just gotta keep him clean|for a few more days. - Well, how much money?|- Sixty-five hundred. Wouldn't it be cheaper|to send him to NYU? How do you feel about|working in Alaska? I'll get right on this. You gotta help me, man!|You gotta help me! Get your damn hands off me. Slow down coming through here, now. What's going on? Hey, you dropped your bag! Hey, man, you dropped your bag. Yo! You dropped your bag. Man, you done dropped your bag. You done dropped your bag. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I'll take it to lost and found. Found where you lost it. Man, where you guys been?|Man, I was just thinking about you. Your brother fucked us. Are you stupid?|This is my fucking car. This is my baby. Oh, sorry. Your brother fucked us! Look, all right. Cool. How's your headache, though? - What headache?|- Does it hurt? I'm passing whuppings out. Okay, okay, I see what you doing.|You got the gun. Stevie's fucking my girl, right? That's a point to take up with Stevie. Maybe Stevie don't want to be around|for us to make a point with him. What are you talking about? Stevie skipped out. Then say it. Don't get|so fucking complex. I'm not complex. You're complex. Do I need to be here for this shit? Shut up! Should we move in? Stay put. They're not gonna kill him. They're just having fun. They'll beat him to a pulp. I think that's|a reasonable assumption. I hope you like soup... because I'm about to knock|every one of your teeth... ...down your throat.|- Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to the|Fashion Museum? I'm a little lost. Put the gun down. What's your problem?|Go get lost somewhere else. Ain't you shocked at how it went down? You came at the right time. We don't have much time, Alvin. What you talking about? There's a question you need to answer. - That's him! That's our man!|- Shit! Unit 2, approach from the south. You need to answer my question.|How you know my name? I'll see you soon, Alvin. There he is! Shit, damn. Damn! What's going on? He 's in the coffee shop. Get out of the way. Get some guys at both ends|of the alley. Want to hear the bad news?|You're alone in a room with me. I think it's a check. Guess it's your lucky day. Sir. We're ready here, sir. I thought I'd find you here. I did too.|You want a drink or something? No, I need to talk to you. - Right now?|- Let's go, right now. I'm coming. I'll be right back.|Fucking ass. What y'all doing|in the men's bathroom? Alvin, man, what's happening?|Man, what's wrong? By yourself? Not now. Not now. Everything in here's broke. What's happening? Have you ever heard of a man getting|$5000 dropped in his lap? Never. What about twice in one day? You got ten G's? I got more than that. - Let me see.|- Calm down. I need you to keep this for me, okay? I gotta get out of town because|there's some strange shit going on. - All right?|- Okay. Read the note. Stevie, read the note.|Are you listening to me? Oh, yeah. I just wanted to let|you know I'm looking up to you. I look up to you. Look up to me another time, all right?|Stevie? I need you to do the right thing. Be careful, Alvin. For sure. Shit! I want both mobile units to maintain|visual contact. If he leaves town... l want to know where he's going|before he does. What if our killer can't find him? We'll just have to make sure he can. Oh, my nuts. My balls. My balls. Okay, tickets. Is that you, Alveen? Alveen! - Shut up.|- Get your ass in here! My name is Alvin, not "Alveen". How could you give out|my e-mail address? That is personal. I don't even know it,|and if I did... nobody wants to talk you. You must've given it to somebody.|There's a message in your name. And nobody just breaks into Netscape.|Okay? Nobody is that smart. "Hello, Alvin, it seems|we have some unfinished business. Unfortunately, your phones|are being tapped... and you're being followed". Someone's been listening... Tika, not now, not now. "You have a beautiful son. It would be a shame if you didn't|follow these instructions. Leave the apartment|at exactly 4 p.m... and go to the following address". He's moving. "Take a taxi to the Fifth Avenue|and 53rd Street subway station. Get on the first subway car you see". Here we go.|I want to make this clear at the top: I prefer the suspect alive. But if anything goes wrong,|don't hesitate. Take him out, no matter what. If the only way to get to him|is through Alvin... so be it. You shoot... l'll answer the letters. Just give me 60 minutes, people,|without any fuckups... you can have a nice vacation. One more block and he gets a cab. Be alert. This guy may not wait for Alvin|to get to the rendezvous point. Got you. He's headed your way.|He'll be there in three minutes. No problem. Well, I'm not certain that's|entirely accurate, Agent Wooly. Arms at your side. Let's take a little walk, shall we? Alvin's passed Wooly,|but there's no confirmation. His radio's out, sir. What do you mean, his radio's out? - I just talked to him.|- There's no response. - Well, what about Sanders?|- He's proceeding exactly as told. What's next? The subway? Train's just arriving. Alert Wood and Boyle, and keep|trying Wooly. I'm headed out. IKeep your eyes open, everybody.|He's at the phone booth. We 're in position. I'm at the red bench. They're all red benches. That's him. This is it.|This is it. Let's go! Out of the way! Stop right there!|I said, stop your car right there! Out of my way! Watch his hands. Game's over. I'm just sitting on the bench. Cordon off the area.|Cordon off the area! Go! What in the hell is going on?|What are you doing here? I heard y'all were giving away $5000.|I thought I'd come and get me some. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. My brother gave me money and a note... to e-mail him some fucked-up|James Bond shit and meet him here. Ain't no crime in that. - Alvin set this up?|- Damn, you getting smarter. You think this is a game? You and|your stupid brother, you asshole. You have no idea|what you're dealing with. He ain't too stupid.|He got your ass down here. This is just, you know, fried hummus. - Piece of shit!|- You! Get your hands off me. I'm just trying to get a ride. I'll give you a ride. Get in. You promised we'd go to the track. She's not running till the 7th race.|Get in the fucking car. You owe me a falafel, motherfucker. This the wrong time for this.|I need to go to the crib right now. You won't be seeing home|for a long time. How many times I gotta say|I don't know where Stevie is? Fuck Stevie, okay?|This is about you. This is about you and your friend|who buzzed me with that thing. That's what I'm trying to tell you.|He's after me. - How'd you do that?|- What? - What the fuck? How'd you do that?|- How'd I do what? That came out of the radio. - He's a ventriloquist, this guy.|- A what? - You know, the guy does the shit...|- Like a DJ? - Hello?|- Like the guys with the dummies. You know, with the voices|and the dummies and shit. Yeah, yeah. He didn't tell you?|I'm a ventriloquist. We're traveling in a black Mercedes... with two Bert-and-Ernie-|looking motherfuckers inside... on Madison Ave. Look at you. You suck.|I could see your lips moving. We about to move past 59th Street.|I'm gonna need backup. I'm gonna need backup. One Adam-12. Code three. I need backup.|I need backup. Who's he talking to? Emergency, I need backup. Shut him the fuck up! We got a problem. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck me! What are you doing? Don't point that gun at me!|Don't point that gun at me! - You shot me, bitch.|- Look out for the bus! Oh, God, please! God, give me strength! Oh, shit! - Shoot the bag!|- All right, look out. God, I can't breathe. Open the door! Where you going?|Alvin, get back here. Get back here. Help us out! - I lost mobility.|- Just look at my car! I hate this guy.|He's the fucking devil. Alvin Sanders is the devil. What are you doing? Open the window. What are we, goldfish?|Help us out of here! It's a blackout situation.|We are negative on all signals. Scanning visual matrix. Negative. - We could try to isolate a pitch.|- It's a million-to-one shot. I would like to make a deal with|the United States Treasury Department. Sir? - It's Wooly's channel.|- Can we trace it? I'd like to trade the life|ofa Treasury agent... for the 42 million in gold. Transferring signal. Since you don't have my gold,|I'll settle for the next best thing. If you want Mr. Wooly alive,|turn over Mr. Sanders to me. Midtown Winslett, 36th Street. Lisa, what's wrong with you? Girl, what's wrong with you? Alvin! Alvin, get up, baby. Please get up. Baby, get up. Come on, Alvin. Come on, come on, please get up.|Alvin, please get up. Why are you doing this to us? Why? Why are you doing this to us? Give us a break. Did you have a nice sleep? What'd you do with Lisa? I put her in the other room|with Gregory. They're fine. This is New York. We don't play|these type of games here. You see, Alvin,|I just want what's mine. I was used by the government,|and now they're using you. I have nothing|to do with the government. Oh, yes, you do. They used you to get to me... and I might add, quite effectively. Here I am. Now for your sake... let's hope you can help me|find my gold. Gold? Give me a pen. I would like to make a deal with|the United States Treasury Department. That son of a bitch. I'd like to trade the life|ofa Treasury agent... He knew Alvin was being surveilled. This whole thing was just a diversion. If you want Mr. Wooly... All right, the drill is simple. We find Alvin before he does. The math on this|is extremely problematic. You have information. I need it. You don't provide that information,|I have to kill you. What are my options? Well.... Obviously... there's torture. No, come on. You're more creative than that.|That's...uh-uh. That's a point well taken, Alvin. And besides, torture... it's unpleasant.|- Yeah. - It's loud.|- You're right. So unpredictable. Wait, no, hold on. No, wait. See... did that really hurt? And if so, how much?|Nobody really knows. But I will tell you this:|I do not have the time... l do not have the manpower, and|I do not have the assets for error. Do you understand that?|Do you get that? I am tired of fucking around|with you, Alvin! When you get your money, you need|to get an anger management class. You! No, you're not very smart,|are you? The only reason you're alive|is because I allow it! Shut up! Shut up! You like little kids, right?|That's my boy in there. I can't let nothing happen to him. It don't matter what's going|on between us. I'll do anything. He ain't got nothing to do with this.|It's between us. Let's make this shit work. Let's go get that gold, man. I'm sorry for that primitive outburst. I've decided the best course|of action... is to contrast the fear of certain|death with an indulgent incentive. Force you to choose|between the extremes. I'm prepared to offer you|the same deal I had with Jaster. We find the gold, you get to keep|six bricks to do with as you please. Roughly one million dollars. And, Alvin... it's a one-time,|non-negotiable offer. All right, let me get this straight: The offer is a million dollars... or you kill me. Correct. A million ain't what it used to be|with taxes. If that's all you got... we'll work with that. Clear. What is that? It's coffee, sir. I wonder why he didn't kill him. Alvin must've talked. He doesn't know anything. I didn't say he knew anything.|I just said he talked. Secure the building. Check the stairwell to the roof.|Take more men. All right, let's go. She gonna be all right, right? She will be, if you do|what you're supposed to do. You're gonna have to trust me. I could trust you a lot better|if you would let my girl and kid go. No, no, no. I couldn't do that. Lisa and your little boy|are motivational tools. Air Unit, what do you got? We got nothing. - Do a sweep on channel 34.|- Affirmative. - Night vision.|- Negative. - Infrared.|- Negative. - We got nothing.|- No signal. Jesus! Alvin Sanders is a needle|in a haystack. Can I help you? All right, Detective Wooly, go ahead. The horses for the fifth race|are on the track. And they're off. Let's see what we have here. What are you doing? I told you it's|in the back stables, not here. I understand. Do you think he hid the shit|in a concession stand? This is perfect. Glad you like it. Hey... hey, little man. Daddy got to run out|and take care of some business. I'll be right back. You take care|of your mother, okay? I'm waiting, Alvin. Yeah, I'm coming. All right, little player. What the hell is that? While I have no doubt about|your sincerity, if there is no gold... l'm sure you'd agree,|there should be some penalty. We don't need these anymore... considering there's no way my|little toy can be disarmed without me. All right, Alvin. Lead the way. I told you the shit wasn't over here.|It's in the back, in the stalls. What if we don't get back in time? We gonna end up killing 5000 people. Perhaps we shouldn't be standing|around chatting, then. Mess around and I'll tell you what: Anything happen to my kid or girl,|it's gonna be bad for you. The horses are on the track.|It's a major race for 4-year-olds. How much gold is there? Roughly 42 million dollars. You the lncredible Hulk? How you|getting all this gold out of here? Here. Yeah. This is it. All right, here we are.|Right here. Nine. No, no, no, no. No, it's not very logical. Logical or not... it's buried in the back.|Don't get it if you don't have to. I gotta get to my family. - I ain't gotta do shit for you...|- All right, open it. You can open it yourself.|I don't give a damn. Open it! Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's all right. It's all right, big fella. Calm down, now. Calm down. Hold on, now.|Just calm down. It's all right. Easy, easy, easy, it's all right.|It's all right. Calm down. What the hell is that? Where's my fucking gold, Alvin? You soft. We got him. He's at the Manhattan Race Track. Get yo bitch ass up. Get up! Get some of this, huh?|Get some of this, huh? Chest, chest, chest, nuts! Oh, shit. The horses are now leaving|the paddock for the race. The horses are now all in the gate. And they're off. Bitch! Alvin! Frigid Pleasure in front|setting a blistering pace. Come on, Frigid Pleasure,|you motherfucker! That's my horse! That's my horse! Shit! What the fuck? - There's another horse on the field.|- Slow down, slow down! We need security! Move! I can't control this shit! The horses are still heading|for the wire! This is disastrous! You gotta stop! Ramirez tries to hold Frigid Pleasure,|but the horse has a mind ofits own! Look out! Get out of the way!|I can't control her! All the horses and riders are down! You don't listen, do you? You can slow down now. We coming to a railing. Do you see the people? Don't you see|the people? Put the brakes on. Couldn't be. It's him. It's the devil. In my 30 years ofracing... l've never witnessed|a spectacle quite like this. Get out of the way! Police! Move! Move! Look out! Get out of the way! Excuse me. Get out of the way! Back up! Back up! Look out! Look out! Look out!|Excuse me! Damn! Hold it right there! Freeze! He's jumped. He's jumped. Lisa! Lisa, baby. Lisa, Lisa. Wake up, baby. Wake up. - I'm getting him out.|- What are you doing with Gregory? I know, I know, I know.... Hold on. I'm gonna be|right there. Calm down, okay? I'll be right back to get you. Lisa, you got to wake up. Ain't nothing wrong with the baby. We got a situation. What is that? - That's a bomb, baby.|- A bomb? - It's a kaboom bomb, not a kapow bomb.|- That's a really big bomb. Pull it! Pull it! Come on, Alvin. Where's the baby? I can hear him.|Where's my baby, Alvin? What's that? What's that? All right. Turn your head. Hurry up. Come on.|What's going on? Turn your face! Oh, God, Alvin. Where's the baby? Come on and burn it. Get it out.|Where's the... I can hear the baby.|Where's my baby, Alvin? Shit! Just take the baby.|Just take the baby and run. Come on, come on, come on!|Let's go get the baby now! - Get him! I gotta take care of this!|- Alvin, no! Shit. What the fuck? Fuck that. Some shit I do know how|to do right here. Oh, shit. Get out of the way! I got a bomb. You got to move! Move the horses. Get blown up, then. Move out of the way! Oh, shit, the brakes! No! Oh, shit! Running out of time. Oh, shit! Brakes! Oh, shit! Hey! Now, come on.|Man, you almost shot me! Shit! You could've fucked around|and shot me. But I didn't. Well, I guess I owe you one. - I guess you do.|- Yeah. Yeah. - Hey!|- Oh, man, this trick shoulder. It's from the gunshot.|I got reflexes. I can't really control my shit. I suppose I had that coming. It's okay. Get that piece of shit out of here. Y'all did bust me upside the head|with a brick. We did a lot more than that. You didn't touch me|in different places? Because... No. Whether you know or not, you|did a good thing for your country. We need to talk about what|the country's gonna do for me. I ain't having a good day. You got some aspirin on you? You want chewable? You be rolling with the shit|in your pocket? - You don't smoke, do you?|- No. You got some water? Oh, boy. Look. Yes, sir. Hey, you two. Hey, what's happening? Oh, man.... - Y'all have fun?|- Yeah, we had a good time. Let's make another one. We had a question to ask you. What might that be? My man G has already mastered|the craft of eating applesauce. He's a genius like me.|We're thinking of moving up... to peanut butter, but I don't want|his mouth to get stuck all together. Baby, he already eats peanut butter. Look at that. I can't believe|you had me come all the way here. You done bamboozled me. Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm looking for The Bronx Zoo|by Sparky Lyle. The Bronx Zoo? Did you try upstairs|in the nature section? It's not about nature.|It's about baseball. The Yankees? Yankee Stadium?|They call it the Bronx Zoo. Okay. Check in the back|on the left side, in sports. Bronx Zoo? "There's no place... like home". I need to make a phone call... to my accountant. Clenteen. Edgar, what's up? I'm hurt. You never write.|You don't call. Alvin, how you doing? I'm doing pretty good.|About to do a lot better. Let me ask you: what's your|policy on finder's fees? That depends on what you find. How about $40 million in gold? - You know where the gold is?|- I might. Don't mess with me, Alvin. I got a pretty good idea|of where it is. It's in the back ofmy head. What's it gonna take|to get it to the front? - You tell me.|- How does five percent sound? Five percent?|Five percent is bullshit! Two million dollars is bullshit? Oh, that's five percent,|is two million? Oh, well, I see. I was multiplying|and forgot to carry the two. I carried it, just not far enough. What I'm saying is,|two million dollars could work. I've got to explain some things. Med school for Gregory ain 't cheap. Where's the gold, Alvin? Let me ask you something: Do you like baseball?
