They might kick us out. Uh, been done, and it would draw too much attention. Wh... What are you doing? I'm taking my shoes off. Mm. I'm going to leave first, and then when the time is right, like when the maTtre d's not, um, looking... you meet me down the street. Uh, excuse me, sir? Hey, run! Run, run, run! Fucker! " Baby! Are you OK? Oh, I'm dying. That was so epic! Well, did we lose him? I don't know. Really, did they even chase us? - Hey. ' What? Hey, hey, hey, look, look, look. Look at them. This is pretty good, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Hi- What? There's only one heart in this body. Have mercy on me. Shut up. What the fuck are we listening to? The soundtrack of my life. That's nice. Can we change it before I dive off a bridge? Oh, there's something you would rather listen to? I don't care, just something that doesn't make me want to kill myself? - It's just a song, Conor. - Come on, change it. - Coffee? - Eh, I'm good with that. - Thank you. - Gmm. You know, you're developing a real talent for being an asshole. Well, when you grow up, you can too. What are you all pissy about? There is the compassion I've been looking for. That's what I'm here for. Seriously, Alexis? What? - It's not funny. It's not funny. - It's kind of funny. Change it? No. Change it. Whoa! That was yours, just so you know. Oh, pull your head out of your ass, man. Blow me. I'm gonna go take a stroll. All right. Hey, be careful. It's a dangerous world out there. Apparently. Love you. Hey, Ralph. What time is it? 6:30. Mm. You get outside today? You eat something, or...? Mm-mm. You OK? I swear, I forgot how to fall asleep last night. Don't, Conor. I had a dream you were having an affair. How'd you find out? It's the fourth one I've had this month. Who am I having the affair with? Some vague girl with dark hair. - Maybe it's you in a wig. - It's not. Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about it, all right? You want to order some food or something before I have to go back? Maybe you should. Yeah, I, I'm gonna. You should have an affair. I... don't know what you're talking about. What are you talking about? Things haven't been very chipper around here. Come on. Come on, we're getting by. How long are you gonna keep pretending? Seriously, I don't know how we got from food to this, but... OK, just listen to me for one second. I don't... no, I don't want to listen to you for a second. It might be a good thing. It would clear the air. It would definitely shake things up between us. I don't know what planet you're on, but on this planet, fucking around is fucking around, and it's not usually the best way to smooth things over. Fine. Are you gonna get that? - You get it if you want. - I don't want to get it. Well, it's probably your dad again. Is that what you want? What? To go fuck around... is that what you want? I don't know what I want. Seriously? Is it what you want? No. Are we really doing this badly? Conor, it's been an impossible fucking year, so please don't ask a stupid question like that. - HGY- - HGY- So, uh... what's the paper saying today? Oh, apparently, we're all gonna die of something. 9h, yeah? Yeah, I heard about that. I can't keep up with all this shit. You know, the ice caps keep melting, something else exploded in Afghanistan, Democrats are bunch of pussies, flu pandemics, de Kooning's at the MoMA, supposedly lime green is the hot color for summer, and the stupid Yankees lost again. I feel like my head's gonna burst. Well, you should try reading without the music on, or the TV. Or both. Can't stand the silence. I got you a latte. Thank you. I think my memory may be evaporating. Yeah. They were all out of bran muffins, so I got you blueberry. I hate blueberries. You're in good spirits. I'm all I can offer. What are you doing here, anyway? Well, you called, like, ten times, so... I don't know, you said you wanted to talk about something. See? Told you. It's evaporating. Time's rubbing me out. Where's Fernanda? Who? The obnoxious Spanish woman you married. She wanted a change of scenery. Wow. I don't like to get emotional about these things. It helps me stay objective. I do better on my own, anyway. OK. Why am I here, then? Oh. Yeah. I need... I need a manager to run the place. No! No! Aw, come on, now, let, let me finish. - I like my place. We do just fine. - You're better than that. I don't really want to have this conversation right now. I didn't furnish you with a six-figure education just so you could run some pop stand. This is a real restaurant, Conor. I don't want your help. Just trying to give you a hand up, you Wozzeck. W... Well... since you put it that way... Fuck off. Hey, El. I got Chinese food. Eleanor? Hello? Excuse me? I'm looking for my wife. Her name is Eleanor Ludlow. Room 2012, second floor. Elevator's around the corner. - This way? - Uh-huh. - The stairs are faster. - Thank you. What the hell were you doing, El? I can't stand this silence anymore, so... ...if you would just say something? Anything? I can't do this anymore. Can't do what? I'm not going back to that apartment ever. OK. Some days everything seems fine, but then I hit the afternoon, and it all goes to shit. I know. I mean, I don't know, but... We can get out of here. We can go wherever you want. I think we should take a break. What? No. I'm so sorry, but no fuckin' way. - Conor. Conor. - No fuckin' way. Please, El? Please? Do not pick up and bail on me? You're the star of my life story. Please be cool about this. Be cool? How do you expect me to react? "Gee, El, that sounds dandy. " "Yeah, yeah, let's call it quits. That, that sounds... reasonable, in terms of the last seven years of my life. " I need to start from scratch. Alone. Just try some other version of myself. There's no "scratch," Eleanor. Maybe, but that's what I want. What if what you want is wrong? Where have you been, Conor, for the last six months? Why does it feel like I've had to go through all this on my own? I don't know. I don't know, 'cause I've been here with you. Please, just let me go. You don't understand. Just" Just let me disappear for a while. Baby... just tell me what to do. You'll figure it out. Hello? Hey. I'm looking for Conor and Eleanor Ludlow. Yeah. Conor. You think if I fall to my knees, everything will be all right? Well, no. I mean, losing a child's not an easy thing to explain. What the fuck do I have to explain? Nothing. You... Nothing. You don't have to explain anything. I... I just, I wanted you to have this. Do you know how many of you assholes we've had to deal with in the last couple of months? Um... no, I don't. I'd appreciate it if you'd get away from my door now. That's brutal. Yeah, that is, uh... that is brutal, man. Maybe she wants you to go after her. No. She doesn't. Maybe wait a couple of days, then go after her? Stu, don't. Well, I guess... it was gonna happen... sooner or later. - Shut the fuck up. - OK, I'm sorry, I don't know what to say. What am I supposed to say? You don't have to say anything. Just... just shut up, drink and... talk about the weather. Hey, uh, the dude at table two says he's gonna kick your ass if he doesn't get his chicken satay soon. Well, he can suck my balls. Well, maybe you should tell him that yourself. - Table two? - Mm-hmm. I'll deal With it. Hey, we're out of beer. What? How can we be out of beer? We got two boxes back there. Go and check... You don't throw shit in my place, man. - What's your problem? - Where's our fucking food, man? - Listen, don't threaten my chef. - OK, calm down. Don't tell me to fucking calm down. Hey! If you threaten my chef again, I will dropkick you out of the fucking door. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Hey, come on! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You are gonna pay. - Conor, Conor, buddy, you all right? - Get the fuck out! - Fuck you! - Yeah, fuck you, man! Nice comeback. Very nice. Get out of here. You, too. Get out. You forget your stupid sunglasses, too? Fuckhead? Maybe we should consider hiring a bouncer. Can't afford a bouncer. It's all right. Cops were good publicity. Yeah, and there were, like, 40 bystanders out there. Well, I appreciate the optimism, guys. Sometimes the worst actions produce the, uh, best results. Sometimes they don't, Stu. Oh, my God, you guys sound like my grandparents. Wait, do you want a Advil or something? No, no, I'm good, thank you. And you know, you don't have to keep up the bogus compassion. - It's all right. - That's a bit aggressive. Well, did you not just see what went down? - Yeah. - I'm kind of in a shitty mood. Oh, well, we're adapting. You know what, you guys should go home. - I got this. - Sure? Yeah, you should go. - You got your stuff? - Uh, yeah. - My bag's back there. - Your bag... Uh... yep. - You sure? I'm going... - All right, let's go. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good night. - Good night. - You sure you're all right? I'm good. Thanks for being a tough guy. You have reached a number that is no longer in service. - Please check the number... - Shit. ...and try your call again. Thank you. Hello? ' Mary? ' Yes? It's Conor. Is El there? Hello... Hello? Hello? Hi'- I thought I could, um... I thought I could stay here for a little bit. Hi, Ralph. You know where the guest bedroom is. Yup. There's towels in the closet in the hallway. Not much in the fridge. Got some Cheerios. That's fine with me... I can... I can go get some stuff. That's easy. Well, I got to get to the restaurant. - OK. - Good night. Night. I have no clue where she's going. She turns off her cell phone, and like that, she's vanished. And... does that make sense to you? - No comment. - Come on, knock it off. No, no, you know, whatever... what do you call it, I plead the Fifth. Like, I tried to be helpful, I pretended, but it didn't work out, so I'm not gonna do that. All right, look, I realize that I've been a little... off-balance lately, but I think with hindsight, I'm learning to deal with it better. A couple of weeks counts as hindsight? Fuckin' A, Stu. I got nothing for you. Come on, come on. Look, I, I'm just asking you a simple question. You don't have to candy-coat it like you're gonna hurt my feelings, but... did you see this coming? Look, with the exception of my dog, I haven't slept next to the same person for more than two or three days in a row, so I don't know what I'm gonna say that's gonna be relevant to your situation. I opened a restaurant for you, asshole. No, you opened a restaurant for you, asshole. And according to the Village Voice, it's "a bar with uninspired food. " Whatever. I fight for its life for you. And by the way, I'm incurring the cost of an extra waitress because, I quote, "She looked at me the right way. " And I thank you for that. - Has it happened yet? - It's... - It's gonna, yeah. - Whatever. Look, I'm not looking for some psychoanalytical, New-Agey bull. I... I'm simply asking for my best friend's opinion, even it is an uninformed piece of crap. OK. "We are young. " Uh-huh. "Heartache to heartache, we stand. No promises, no demands. Love is a battlefield. " Pat Benatar. You're a fucking idiot. Look, I feel like I walk on eggshells around you. You know? Uh... I tried to talk to you about this for months... I'm not talking about that. This is what I'm talking about, man. I don't know how to be your friend anymore. You know, you're no fucking picnic. So I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna sit. I'm just gonna sit here. I'm just gonna be here. And I'm not gonna say a thing. I'm sorry. OK. But I'm asking you now. Uh... You guys not making it makes sense to me. - Yeah? - Yeah. When someone flirts with extinction... ...I think they got to do whatever they got to do in order to... get their life in order. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Look, I saw her the other day. - You what? - I saw her. - Where? - Astor Place. - Did you... did you talk to her? - No. - You didn't talk to her? - No. No. She, she was, uh, she was far away. She was walking away. She was going to class or something. Class? Yeah. She had her book bags with her or something. - She was going to class. - What school? Like NYU or Cooper Union or... - I don't know! - The New School? I don't know. It's not hard to find out. - Why didn't you tell me? - I just did. What are you guys talking about? - You. - Oh... Hi'- OK? Um... I'm not here to approve... or disapprove... just so you know. Hm? Your mother always gave me crap for never stepping up to the plate. Uh... OK. What? She said I never stepped up. Uh, I'm sorry, what does that have to do with anything? Well... you're a bit like me. No, I'm not. No, I'm fucking not. I stepped UP- OK. So what else? Nothing. Nothing. We don't have to keep talking. Yeah, but you're the one who came into the room. Yeah, to turn down your stupid music. Oh. Every day... I do one thing that makes me happy. All right? One thing... and that is I... listen to my stupid music while reading the stupid paper. And that's the best way I've found to deal with myself. SO just back to the... guest room and count the fuckin' raindrops. "Count the fuckin' raindrops"? I was never very good at this kind of thing. OK. It isn't your job to investigate the expansive memory that's called "the past" and judge what is right and what is... Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about? You shouldn't be interested in regretting things. I'm not. Hey, Stu, what's up? I'm looking at her right now. Wait, wait, wait, I can't hear you, man. I'm looking at her right now. Stu, I can't understand a word you're saying. I'm looking at your wife. She's ordering food. Where are you? The Smile. Conor? Conor? Hey, hey. Where is she? She left. What do you mean, she left? shelefi. Why didn't you follow her? I'm not a creep. I'm not gonna follow her. Let's do this. Most people could probably provide an intuitive answer to this question. At the bottom, the sense of self corresponds to that experience of ownership and impenetrability of one's thoughts, of... one's internal dialogues, of one's affective states... that many, but not all, - of us have from infancy. - Hey. Can I borrow a piece of paper and a pen? ...solitude is held as constituting... Please. ...our sense of personal uniqueness... ...of identification, - Thanks. - Of demarcation from others. - And... the pen? And it's perhaps that very same... I'll give it back. ...solitude that... Descartes had in mind when he redefined the concepts of subject and subjectivity. You know, ultimately, being oneself means that the faculty of knowing... the faculty of knowing lies within the subject... in his head, and... the subject has such a status by dint of being enclosed within himself, separate and... Hi again. Would you mind passing this to the girl with the red hair? Come on, please? ...we say, "What's got into you?" to express surprise... Thanks a lot. Don't forget your pen. ...disapproval of unexpected and bizarre behavior. And again... doesn't common sense... - Red hair. Thank you. - ... tell us that strange behavior is signaled by tapping one's forehead with one's forefinger. Boy, I'm learning something. So, "Why the Mind Is in the Head" is the title of one of the lectures delivered at the 1951, um, symposium. But, um... Hey. ...one of the most authoritative voices in this chorus is Ken Bergens, who asked the question: Can we compellingly rein scribe what it is to be... ...the individualist premise and toward the relational... Hey! - Hey, Rigby. - What the fuck are you doing? What? Come on, I... I barely got a chance to respond before you went AWOL. - What did I ask you, Conor? - Just give me a second to talk. - What the fuck did I ask you! - Just give me a goddamn second! I gave you plenty of seconds! Do me a favor, leave me the fuck alone! Fine. Fine, you do what you got to do. You just keep fuckin' walking... Conor? Oh, shit! - Conor? - Is he all right? Well, that was exciting. Yeah, it was awesome. So you're back in school? I'm taking some classes. I almost didn't recognize you. What do you mean? Just your hair. Oh. It's really pretty. Where are you living? None of your business. So, is that what you so desperately needed to talk to me about? No. What is it, then? I was gonna say something really good. It would've solved all our problems and made everything all better. I just forgot what it was. That's too bad. I know. I'm gonna go. Well, hey... I just want... I just want some time to talk it out, El. Then you can disappear off to wherever it is you disappear to. You ready, sir? Yeah. Yeah, I was born ready. All right. Nice and easy. There you go. Watch your step. See you around. - All right, watch your head coming up. - You got him? I got him. Now, take it easy. Strap in for me. OK. May I keep stalking you? Good-bye, Conor. Look, just tell me how long... All right. Look, I'll call you tomorrow, and we'll... talk through the... logistics. Yeah. No. No, that's it. All right, thank you. Sure. Unreal. - You have fun? Shall we...? - Yeah. - Say good night. - Good night. Well, it's been real, everybody. - No, it hasn't. - Hey. Goddamn it. Slow night? Couple of people came in to use the bathroom. - How we doing? - Well, aside from being an endangered species, not so good. Can you translate that for me, please? Friday night, it's the only night we're making any money. I... I have missed some bills, and... we can't cover the overhead. I see. Yeah. You got a plan B? Burger King? Seriously. Come on, I want to show you something. - This is the spreadsheet from... - No, no, I can't. Um... Oh. Oh. You got protection? - Shh... - Viagra? - Please be quiet. - You want me to hold your hand? - Shut your mouth. Shut up. - Want me to watch? Dude, I'm being serious. Shut up. - Don't... - You got it. Anytime. You're ruining it. Can you just shut up? - It's cool. - I believe. - In what? - A higher power. Can you hear it? Not right now. - Later. - Bye. - Bye. - You guys have fun. You know, I got a plan B. 9h, yeah? You know what, you can... you can get out of here. I was thinking about getting my real estate license. - What? - Mm-hmm. Why would, uh... Why would you do something like that? Uh, 'cause it seems more impressive than pouring drinks. Does it? All right. What happened to your life in the arts? Oh, that'll probably phase in to a... the Sunday afternoon hobby kind of thing. YOU? Plus, I think it's kind of indecent to have things so worked out that they wind up exactly like you thought they would. Oh. Are you gonna be OK? Probably. We live in a world full of probablys. Well... I'm a decent listener... if you ever want to talk about, you know... whatever. Talking about whatever's overrated. I prefer just to, you know, let things stew inside of me, then have a violent out... What'd you do that for? It just seemed like the next interesting thing to do. I'm, I'm kind of married. Yeah? I don't mind. I kind of do. Uh, there's nobody looking. You know, in... in another life, I... Mm. We shouldn't do this. When's the last time that you got laid properly? Oh, fuck, I can already taste the regret. Well, stop thinking, because it's not healthy for you. - Alexis? - Yes? Tomorrow's gonna be awkward. Probably. Hi. What are you doing in here? I was just checking on things. Yeah? I was about to feed him. Oh, fuck. You're not supposed to give up on me this easily. Got him for Cody. Yeah, I know that. Thanks. What was a two-month-old baby supposed to do with a fuckin' fish anyway? You look like shit. Thanks. So... what do you want to do with him? Is there something wrong with you? Most likely. Why do you ask? Just... all the reflective talk the other night, it was, uh, just a tad weird. I suppose I hit the sauce a little too hard. You're not dying or something, are you? Not that I know of. Although I did forget my name the other day. Yeah? I was at Starbucks ordering a coffee, and the guy behind the counter... said, "What's your name, sir?" and... I just got... stuck in a blank. No idea who I was for a good minute, until, uh, in the end, I just had to walk out. I'm sure that happens to a lot of people. On the road to senior citizenship. Yeah. Yeah, you are. On a clear day, I can see the end of my life staring me in the face. You know, it's fucking bizarre, one day, you turn the corner of your street and everything's changed, but you never saw it happening. It's like it's all been sucked up into some kind of... cosmic vacuum cleaner. You're the same age now as I was when you were born. Now, that's freakin' absurd. Where are you going with this? I'm not going anywhere with it. My slut of a wife left me gathering dust on the couch, and now the only thing left to do is nothing. Well, that's what you get for marrying a woman half your age. Aw, fuck you. Fuck you, man. Fuck you. Seriously, don't lay this "owner of a lonely heart" bullshit on me. I... I watched this happen. She was just one in a long line of arm candy I watched you fuckin' plow through in the last, what, 17 years? 17 years since you got tired of my mother, so, please... It was, uh, it was pretty inevitable you were gonna age out of it. Do you think I enjoy feeling like an asshole? Yeah, it kind of seems like it. You know, I was warming up to try and tell you something nice. Yeah? Go ahead. We all know a little something about sadness. Or whatever you want to call it. Yeah, well, I want to know a little less about it. Anyway, how's that supposed to be nice? Have you talked to her at all? - Shall we do this? - Yeah. Want to say a couple of words for closure's sake? Does that ever really close anything? No. Bye, Ralph. Oh. What the...? I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting you. No, no, no. No, I wasn't... wasn't expecting me, either, so... - Hi. - Hey. Is she here? No. Is, is she living here? Do you want to come in for a second? Would that be all right? Yeah. Come in. OK. Thanks, Mary. Are you sure you don't want a glass of wine? - No? - No. I probably shouldn't get started. I started already. Can I ask how she's doing? I don't know, to be completely honest. As good as she can be. Do I seem like a different person to you? Do you feel like a different person? Yeah, kind of. You look the same to me. You know I didn't like you when Eleanor first brought you out here for dinner. However long ago it was. How long ago was it? Seven years. Seven years? Yeah. You sat there in the exact same spot seven years ago, with a glass of water because you were afraid to have a drink in front of me. This obnoxiously perfect kid who walked off with my daughter's attention. You grew on me, though. Oh, well. It's true. Look! I don't want to interfere with your life, or whatever she has to do, but I can't... I can't just chalk this up to destiny. I walked on with my life because... moving forward was, was the only way to go. I guess people grieve differently. I wish there was some appropriate, articulate thing to say, but... I just wanted the mundane daily bullshit back. I think Eleanor wanted something else. And I think that, um... ...there was nothing appropriate about any of this. - I don't get it, man. - What don't you get? Well, your... your dad is, like, the, like, a culinary maverick. He's, like, the Mick Jagger of the restaurant game. All you got to do is make one phone call and it saves our asses, but instead, you want us to drown, like 90 percent of the other restaurants in the city. - I don't get it. - Stu, Stu... - Well, I... What did he do? - What do you mean, "What did he do?" Your dad, what did he do? I mean, at least take a page out of his book. - What did he do? - He married my mom. - What does that mean? - That means he married my mom. She gave him all the money her family left her, and he opened the restaurant, it was a big success, and then he dropped her like a bad habit. So, you know what? Why don't you go and find yourself some lonely, loaded old lady - and then we can take it from there. - Well... You know what, I'd rather fail catastrophically than, you know, give him the satisfaction of thinking he handed me my life on a platter. That is the stupidest thing in the history - of stupid things to say. - Whoa. Why is that stupid? Why is that stupid? You know what's stupid? You think I'm gonna call my dad, and he's gonna go, like, "Hey, son, yeah. Why don't you come and bring your friends, and they can work here, too. " - Yeah. - It's not a fuckin' slumber party. No, it's not a slumber... It's a job. - Stu, as decent a cook as you are... - I'm a chef. All right, chef, you don't exactly cut it in those kitchens. Oh, relax. You don't want to have this conversation. - Let's talk about it. - You don't want this conversation. When's the last time you julienned a carrot? - You really want to have - Seriously. - This conversation? You really - When's the last time - want to have this conversation? - you cooked an egg - You really want to have - and you didn't blanch the yolk? You know, in those kinds of kitchens, in that world... ...this conversation? I've been pulling my weight fine. - ... you would be a busboy. - You're the one... - You fuckhead. Fucking failure. - Yeah, no. I'm telling you, man. You know what, those stupid glasses out there - need picking up. - Fuck you. You like that? - Fucking asshole. - Wait, whoa! You hit me with fucking kale? That all you got? Come on. Oh, God! Jesus. Ow! Ow, ow! Roll! OK, OK, yeah, yeah. This is what you want? Is that a joke? No, I think they're really going at it. We're not quite open yet. Are you all right? I was third in my class. The New York Academy of Culinary Arts, you fuckhead. I know that, asshole. Call me "chef. " I love our little set-up here. I do. Just, the lease has gotten prohibitively expensive, and unless you want to camp out in the kitchen... OK. I'll... I'll bring the sleeping bags. It's just... time to let go. Time to grow up. I am grown up. lam. Fine. When do we call it quits? End of next week. Can we have one last banger before we... close shop? Yeah. Can we abuse some heavy narcotics? Whatever tickles your thing. Good. I'm sorry. Blow me. OK. Yeah, it's amazing. So you're well? I'm OK. - Good. - Yeah. I'm just painting, and... here, and... you know, - that same stuff. - Hey, hey, hey. Sorry. Holy Shatner. Nice to see you, too, Stuart. Well, this is nice. Like old times, reconnecting and all. - I'm gonna go to the kitchen. - Yeah. I will join you. - Shirley Temple? - Please. What do I owe you? Your money's no good here. You know that. OK. Business is good? It's great. We're closing. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Yeah, me, too. So, what's next? I don't know. I, I thought I might... develop some interests in things that people actually take an interest in. You gonna work with your dad? Hmm? You know, before you, I had no idea who I was. Then when we were together, I thought I had it all figured out. Now I'm just back to wondering again. Well, when you figure it out, tell me how, OK? OK. Let's get out of here. - What? - Let's go. - Right now? - Yeah. That's the idea. Uh... I don't believe in wasting time. OK. Yeah, uh... Don't forget to fill it up before you drop it off. You got it. ...thunderstorms moving in this evening. Heavy rain expected across the tristate... That... - What are you doing? - Do you... want to listen to that? Yeah. Suck it up, Ludlow. Is it gonna rain? Fuck me! Of course we get the car with the retarded wipers. We could just wait it out. What are we doing here? You tell me. You're the one who said that we needed to talk. You stalked me, you went to my parents' house. What are we doing here? Just recently, like an hour ago, you walked into my bar and you suggested we drive aimlessly into the perfect fucking storm here. This is funny. Yeah. Yeah, it's fuckin' hilarious. You know, for a while there, I thought we'd actually pieced together a pretty decent life. I have to move everything out of the apartment next week. Do you want me to keep anything for you? Where will you move to? I don't know. I could stay with my dad for a little while, till I get things figured out. How is he? Oh... I'm pretty certain he's losing his mind. Fernanda left him. - Oh. - Yeah. He's getting all talkative. Waxing philosophical. Same shit he pulls every time he's between significant others. I think it's probably more than that. Yeah, maybe. At least you guys are talking. Yeah. What'd you tell your parents about us? What would I say? That we're fabulous. I feel like we're living some dreadful disaster clich?. We are. You're sopping wet! Oh, you noticed? Thank you. Wait... - No, no, no, no. - No, wait, wait. - Shh, shh, shh. - Just a second, wait. Uh, shit. I slept with someone else. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. What do you mean, it doesn't matter? Get off me. - Don't... El, come on. - Get off. What do you mean, it doesn't matter? Get over yourself, Conor. - You don't care? - No. That's bullshit. I know you care. El, you're supposed to say, "What the fuck are you thinking, Conor?" You're supposed to say, "You're a selfish piece of shit. " No. We're past that. And you just said it for me. Come on, let's go back to the city. I'm gonna get out of here. Hey, Phoebe. - Hey, how are you? - Hey, how are you? Good. Your hair got long. - Not really. - Yeah. He's in his spot. You could make this place your own, if you want. Do what you like with it. Seriously, I... I'm done. Used to be pretty cool, once upon a time. Some of the same faces still show up, except more wrinkled. Some of them less so. The Stones were in last week, after playing the Garden, but... mostly people are just fading away. I've been doing this way too long. I think you done pretty good. Yeah, well, complacency scares the shit out of me. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Then how's this? I, uh, forfeited the loan the bank gave me, I'm losing the lease on my bar... Eleanor's gone... with the fucking wind. I'm 33 years old, and my life's a fucking boat wreck. I'm in my 60s. I lost a grandson this year that I'm basically forbidden to talk about, my third wife just walked out on me, and I come here every afternoon to this restaurant named after your mother. It's time to shoot the crow. Where are you gonna go? You gonna fly off to Never-Never Land? Become a Buddhist? Tell you what, you can return and enlighten us all. Oh, fuck enlightenment. I'm hoping to figure out some way of dealing with reality. What are you doing here, anyway? I was... I was just in the neighborhood. "Just in the neighborhood. " What is it? Do you ever wonder why we fall in love with a specific person? Not really. I think to myself, "Something's wrong here, but I can't quite put my finger on what it is. " There's always one that haunts us. So give her time. It's the right thing to do, given the circumstances. Circumstances suck. Yeah. I really forbid you from talking about him? Uh-huh. What the fuck are you gonna say to me? Ever since he... Ever since what happened happened, any thought or, or memory of him has been something just to run my mind as far as fuck away from as I can get, and... A shooting star only lasts a second, but... aren't you glad to at least have seen it? That's nice. It's a little Hallmark, but it's nice. I mean it, it's nice. You have a delicate soul, Dad. Oh, nobody ever said that to me before. You know, we're in imminent danger of sappiness. Oh, we can't have that, can we? Mm-mm. - You hungry? - Yeah. I'll fix you something up. OK. Hey, you got my drinks? Yeah. Does anyone else work here? - Not right now. - Guess what? - What? - No more beer. Ah, shocker. All right. Hey, this is the last of the beer, so drink it slowly. However, there's plenty more liquor. Enjoy. Table four, right? Yeah. Thank you. Hey, guys. Get you a beverage? - Uh... uh... - Baby? Uh... just a beer, please? Uh, actually, we're all out of beer right now. Oh, um, then just a glass of red wine would be good. You got it. And for you, sir? - Same. - OK. Something wrong? Uh... no, no. I'll- I'll get you your drinks. " Sia? Yes? - Two reds, table four. - Got it. Hey, Stu, where's Alexis? Hello? - Hey. - What? Oh, I'm not taking a shit. - We're smoking it. - I don't even want to know. Can I interrupt you two for just a second? - Mm-hmm. - I have something very important to ask you, for probably the last time. Shouldn't you be cooking some fucking food? Come on. - All right. You're right. - Me, me, me. Mm, are you guys fucking? Hey, get the fuck out of here. Come on, go make some mediocre bar food. Stupid. Come here. Come here, come here. - I love you. - I lov... Ooh, yeah, I love you. Go. Go. Wash your hands, OK? Should we get back in there? So... - Here we are in the bathroom. - Here we are. - Alexis, about the other... - So, you two gallop off into the sunset the other day? Oh, yeah. Didn't you hear? Happy ending and everything. You know, I could fall madly in love with you. I'm not sure that would be the smartest thing. Why is that? You know, it's funny how a person, just by living, can damage another person beyond repair. How's that funny? I don't know. This is why I'm not a bartender. Don't wipe your shirt... - Ready? - This kitchen is closed forever! Yeah! Did you throw that glass? This is his place. Don't worry about it. He's the only one who can throw them. - No, not... - Oh, give me a kiss, give me a kiss. - Give me a kiss, lady. - Aw... - Ah. - Ah. Hey! Hey! How much do I owe you? What? How much do I owe you? I don't remember. Hello? Hey, baby. Um... no, I'm, I'm lying on the sidewalk. No, I'm good. It's good. Um... Yeah, I don't know, on, uh... I don't know what street this is. Clinton... it's just... just below Houston. Uh, Clinton just below Houston. Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you in a minute. How much do you want? Forget about it. What? Hey! What the fuck is your problem, man? Hello? Hello? Hello? When did we get all this stuff? I don't know. I... I guess it kind of accumulated. You can... store some of it at my parents' house if you want. No. I was thinking I could get a storage unit, till we figure things out. I'm sorry. What are you thinking? That memory's so fucking weird. How's that? I forgot what he looks like. Sometimes I'll get a... quick glimpse of his eyes... ...oras... a small smile he used to give me from the crib. But then he vanishes. I can't picture his face. I can't picture his face anymore. Pale. He was pale. He had tiny ears. He had your nose. Your mouth. Your chin. He had your... But he had my eyes. And I loved that. And he was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I wasn't ready for what this feels like. Neither of us were. I just want him back. I know. I love you. I know. Hey, guys... I'm gonna go take a stroll before the rush, OK? - OK. - OK. Aren't you worried about these 15 people in that section? What are we gonna do with them? Um, you know what we do is we open up this back room here.
