Copy that, 507. Backup is en route. ETA 10 minutes. Adrian? Adrian! Adrian. Cobbs. Cobbs! This is Unit 507. I've got an officer down. Repeat, officer down. Copy, 507. EMS is being notified. Backup to your location in five minutes. It's gonna be so much better than the city, honey. You're gonna have sidewalks to ride your bike on and a yard. You're gonna love it. I miss Daddy. I know, honey. But you're gonna be so much happier here. I promise. You'll see. There they are! - Hi. - Hi. You must be Claire. Your mommy's told me a lot about you, so I brought you something very special from our office Ta-da! I'm sorry. She's still not 100% about this whole moving thing. That's all right. She will be when she sees her new room. Come on. Let's go inside. Welcome home. What do you think, hmm? I mean, I know it's not perfect, but I think with a little bit of work, it'll be great. Well, you know, there was a lot of interest in this house, mostly from real estate speculators, but I felt that it needed a family. You like it? Did something happen here? What? Well, it's an old house. It's got a lot of history, but nothing too bad. - There you go. - Oh, thanks. Those are for the front door, the back door, and the garage. I'm right in town. Call me if you need anything at all. - What is this? - That's for the keys. Oh, okay. You keep that. Thank you. Oh. "Lilith." What's that? What's what? Claire. Please, Mommy, can I keep her? But you have so many other dolls already, honey. But I want this one. I think that one probably belongs to somebody else. Finders keepers. Fine, but you have to let me wash it first. Come on. All right, keep unpacking. Okay. Everything's going pretty well. I mean, she's not super excited, but... What's going on with you? Same-old, same-old. Grading papers. Everything okay with the move? Yeah. You know what? Thanks so much for helping me with that article. It's hard to imagine there's actually people who believe this stuff is real. Sometimes it's easier to rely on a supernatural explanation rather than confronting the truth. So what are you gonna do now? Well, I'm gonna talk to some of the local papers, but I really just want to take some time and work on my book and focus on Claire. Good. It's much bigger than our old apartment. - Claire? - Everything okay? You know what? I'm gonna go. I'll call you later? Okay, honey. Good luck with the unpacking. Thanks. And I have some friends for you in one of these boxes. Tomorrow I have to go to a new school with new kids. I'm scared. I hope they're nice, not mean like some kids. What if they don't like me? What if they don't need any new friends? Hey. I know it's hard. You're gonna do great. I promise. Can I sleep with the light on? Aren't you forgetting something? Mom. Come on. Okay. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. - 3 times 3? - Nine. - 3 times 4? - 12. - 3 times 5? - 15. 3 times 6? Claire? Are you paying attention? Very good. - 3 times 7? - 21. Hey, did you really move into the bad house? I heard it's haunted. Stop it. You moved into the bad house? Stop it. It's gonna get you. It's gonna get you - It's gonna get you - Hey! Stop it! Hello? Hello? Oh, my God! - The door was open. - Can I help you? I'm Janine, your new neighbor. Alyson. I thought this place was gonna... Oh! Whoops! They kept all the original fixtures. It's lovely. Oh, where are my manners? Sorry they're a bit smushed, but my cats were walking on them. Thank you. Oh, look. There's one of them now. Smokey! He's my oldest. You have a little girl. Yeah. Claire. She's nine. My cats simply adore children. Oh, that's great. So if Claire ever wants to come and play with the kitties, just send her over. They would love it. And if you need anything, just holler. - Okay, thank you. - Bye! It's nice to meet you. Wow. Mommy said it would be better here, that I'd be happy. She promised. I thought things would be different, that people would be nicer. But they're not. They pick on me. I hate them. I wish they were dead. - I won't go back there! - Claire, you have to! - Stop it. - No. - Yes. - I want to go home. - We are home. - No! You don't scream at me. No! Let me go! They put you in a wooden box Claire, honey, I know you don't want to go to school, but you need to eat. Cover you up with dirt and rocks Don't you laugh as the hearse goes by For you may be the next to die Claire, honey, didn't you hear me calling your name? Claire. The worms crawl out They crawl all over your dirty snout Your chest caves in Honey, where did you learn that song? Your brain turns into sauerkraut Sluggo! Smokey! Din-dins! No! No! No! No! No! No, no, no, no! Separation and divorce can be very stressful for a child. An entire support system's been torn out from under her. The future suddenly appears very uncertain. The hardest thing is that you're having to go through this alone. I just... I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. I mean, she won't go to school, and she'll barely eat anything. Her father still lives in the city? Yeah. Returning to the dynamics of that environment might be a helpful thing for her, even just for a visit. I'd strongly consider letting her go back. Thank you for your time, Doctor. The subject exhibits traits I've seen in similar cases of callous, unemotional children. Distinctive lack of remorse and empathy. Further study will be required before I can determine the presence of psychopathy. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You're not even gonna touch your ice cream? Fine. Then I will. I wanna go home. Honey, this is our home now. Why? 'Cause you and Daddy can't get along? It's a lot more complicated than that, sweetie. It's your fault. Claire... You're always so busy with your stupid writing. No wonder he hates you. I'm gonna go take care of the check. What have you got there? Give her back. A pretty girl like you should have a nice, new doll, not an ugly, old one like this. - She's not ugly. - Well, look at her. She's practically falling apart. I tell you what. I bet I have a new one in the back room. Why don't we throw this one away, and I'll go get her? Give her back! Claire! I am so sorry. What is wrong... Claire! I'm sorry. I think we should talk about this, don't you? She's a murderer! - What are you talking about? - Your daughter! I don't... What? A child trampled through my garden last night. Janine... I saw the way she looked at them. My babies wouldn't hurt anybody, and now they're dead, and she killed them! Okay, well, I'm sorry, but I can assure you that my daughter had absolutely nothing to do with your cats. Excuse me. Good night, Rose. Good night, Hank. Someone there? - Hey, Daddy. - It's Daddy's little girl. Oh, my God, I've missed you. Bedtime is at 8:30 and no sugar after 6:00. Yeah, I know. I've done this before. Just keep an eye on her, okay? Ready to go, sweetheart? Okay, you keep warm, all right? I love you. Well, that's a nice house. How much did you put down? Don't. I bet you could get some good money if you flipped it. Jonathan, please. There's a unit that opened up two floors down from me. Earl even said he'd waive the deposit. Look, just take care of her, okay? Okay. Looks like there's a leak in one of your fittings. There's something else. - What's that? - You know these people? No. No, they must be the people that used to live here. That looks like a mueca quitapena. A what? Mueca quitapena. The doll. You don't see them here in the States much. They're not usually that big. My daughter actually found this in the house. She's gotten pretty attached to it. Bad luck to find someone else's mueca. "Local family found slain." Zachary, this nice lady is gonna ask you some questions, okay? Hi. I'll be right outside. Do you mind if I sit down? I'm Alyson Simon. I recently moved into your old house. And I have a little girl who's nine, just about the same age you were when you lived there. She found your doll. Do you remember your doll? She's grown really attached to it. Can you tell me why you did it, Zachary? Why'd you kill your family? Was it... Was it the house? Was it something in the house? Zachary. Zachary! It's time to go. No, I just need one more minute. He's not gonna tell you anything. Don't you let the hearse by For you may be the next to die - Where did you hear that song? - Ma'am? Where did you hear that song? Tell me where you heard that song! The kid killed his whole family and two cops in my house! We found his picture under my daughter's floor! Mrs. Simon, the state civil code is very clear. A death in the home is only a material defect if it occurs within three years of the sale. Material defect? This isn't a cracked shingle. It's a multiple homicide! What do you want me to do? Tell the bank that you misrepresented the condition of the property and get me my damn money back. There's no cooling-off period. This is a done deal. Then list it. You said there was a lot of competition. Sell it to one of the others. Yeah, well, um... - There was no one else. - Listen... I'm gonna be honest with you. With the history of this house, selling it is not gonna be easy, believe me. No. You know what? I'm calling my lawyer. There's no reason to get... Damn it. You knew this would happen. You were my friend. And I always will be. Why? It's her turn. She needs me. You understand, don't you? Why you have to go? I'm scared. Don't be. You're going to be happy again. You're going to be free. You can play forever. With you? Come find us, Zachary. Come find us, Zachary. We'll be waiting. You know, sometimes your mother and I, we act like mean children on a schoolyard. We say things to each other that we don't really mean, and you have to listen to it, and it's not fair. But both of us want you to know that we love you more than you can ever imagine. Well, what about Mommy? What about Mommy? Do you love her? I do. Well, I just don't understand why we can't live together and things can be like they used to. Okay. Because sometimes people who love each other need a little time apart to remember why they loved each other in the first place. But I promise you I'm working on it. No, you're lying. No, sweetie. Yeah, you don't love her. - Yes, I do. - You don't love me either. Claire... And I don't love you. Why doesn't anyone listen? We don't want a new mommy. We want our mommy to come back so that things can be like it used to be. You're the only one that listens to me. I will never stop loving you, ever. I promise. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. Hope to die? Come on, let's go home. Your favorite pizza. Here you go. And... some funny movies to make you laugh. Thought I'd come by and surprise you. No, no, no, I told you that tonight is not a good night. Is she here? Can I meet her? Oh. She is just adorable. Who are you? My name is Kathy. I'm a friend of your father's. He never talks about you. - Kathy's a friend from work. - Yeah. So what grade are you in, Claire? Sweetheart, someone asked you a question. - So? - So why don't you answer her? - I don't want to. - Jonathan... Claire's in third grade. Well, your father told me that you like dolls. I brought you one. Isn't that nice? What do you say? It's ugly. No, it's not ugly. Yes, it is. It's ugly. I don't want it. It's okay. I'm sure she'll open up when she's ready. But until then, maybe she can play with Sally, huh? Hey! That's crossing the line. You pick that up right now. - It's just a little thing. - Claire, now! That didn't go as well as I expected. She just moved to Monterey, and she left all of her friends, she's in a new school, and the separation between Alyson and me is really hard on her. - I didn't mean to... - Kathy... I told you that I needed to be alone with my daughter tonight. I'm sorry. I just... I wanted to be with you. Tell you what. I could use a drink. Why don't you let me finish up these dishes? You go down the corner and get us a bottle of wine. I really don't think that's a good idea. Oh, come on. You really don't take no for an answer, do you? Listen, you deserve a chance to relax. Okay. And I'm gonna get some chocolate chip ice cream because that's Claire's favorite. - I'll be right back. - Sure. One quiet night I've been waiting oh, so long Claire? Claire, is that you? Jon? Jon, is that you? 911, help me. - 911. What's your emergency? - Oh, my God. What's your emergency, ma'am? Ma'am? Do you need medical assistance? - They're here. - Ma'am, are you there? Ma'am? - Hi. - Hey. Do they know what happened? Said it looks like someone broke in. Signs of a struggle. I was gone 10 minutes. Were you guys serious? No. She was just a friend from work, but we've gone out a couple of times. That's it. Why don't you come back with us? I gotta stay here and deal with the police. - You sure? - Yeah. Why don't you and Claire go back? I don't want you anywhere around this. Okay. Call us if you hear anything. Thanks. Come on, honey, let's go get your stuff. Oh, God. Oh, my God! You've reached Ken Stevens. Please leave a message. Hi, this is Alyson Simon. I was just calling to see if you had put any more thought into the house situation. Could you give me a call back, please? Ms. Simon? It's Ken Stevens. Ms. Simon? It's Ken. I wanted to come by and clear the air a little bit, Ms. Simon. I thought, uh... I thought we could talk about the house's history. Claire? Is that you, honey? Okay, yeah. You know what? What do you want me to say? You want me to say I made a mistake? Fine, I did. I made a mistake. You know, I didn't call you to argue. We gotta figure out what we're gonna do about our daughter. The therapy isn't working and I don't know what else to do. When she came over, she had this spooky-looking doll with her. Yeah, and she won't go anywhere without it. She happened to mention that Kathy brought her a new one? What do you mean? She brought her a new doll. I found it underneath her bed torn apart. I'm talking violently. - Wow. - I know it's just a doll, but I can't help but think it might better if it were gone. I'll be right back. Lily? Lily? Where's Lily? Oh, God, honey, you scared me. Where is she?! Claire! Where is she? Come on, honey. Claire, it is too late. Put it... Claire! - Claire! - Where's Lily? - Stop it! - How could you do that to her? She was my friend! My only friend! Stop it! She did not belong to you! She belonged to someone else. - Ow. - What? What? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Claire, honey, where is this from? Who did this to you? I don't know! Claire! No! - Good morning. - Hi. Are they real? You come on in, I'll tell you all about them. See you in a bit. How many of you have ever heard the expression "giving someone the evil eye?" One of the best known and perhaps the most frightening Latin American superstitions is called Mal de Ojo. Ophelia? The belief is that the evil spirit can direct bad luck or even injury at someone with nothing more than a simple look. Children, particularly the ones that are not baptized, are believed to be more susceptible to this curse. Next. Oftentimes in Central America, you'll see children wearing something red or even having a simple red thread tied around the wrist to ward off Mal de Ojo. Lights, please. Okay, well, finish the readings on superstition for next time. Alyson, hi. I'm sorry to hear things aren't going well with the move. - Oh, yeah. - Did you bring it? I did. And it's from Guatemala? - Tecal. - Hmm. It's a worry doll. Some people believe that when a child has trouble sleeping, it's because a large amount of stress has built up, but a worry doll worries in the child's place so the child sleeps better. Does it work? Sometimes, but the question is does it work because the doll has magical powers, or because the child believes it does? Okay, assuming that it does work, and this doll can transfer the child's worries to itself, could it work the other way around? I mean, could the doll transfer something to the child? Look, Alyson, if your daughter's having issues, I'm really not the right person. Okay, just look at something. This happened the other night. I picked it up. I was trying to get rid of it, and now Claire has a bruise in the exact same place on her arm. - It's not a voodoo doll. - I know it's not. But I took this doll that night and put it in a Dumpster, and the very next morning, it was back. This doll. Yeah. Can you help me? Yeah. If you don't mind leaving it, I can take a closer look at it for you. You can keep it as long as you like. I want this doll as far away from my daughter as possible. Okay. Thanks. I want you to realize that as a professional who works regularly with children, I have a responsibility to report... suspicious behavior... to the authorities. What... What do you mean, um, suspicious behavior? Tell me about her arm. Wait a minute. Are you... Is that what this is about? Are you... Are you accusing me of abusing my daughter? I'm giving you a chance to explain it. What? Are you... Of course not! Absolutely not! Come sit down for a second. It's very important that you help me understand how this happened. Understand what? She's a kid. Kids play hard. Why don't you ask her? I did. She told me that you grabbed her. - You lost your temper. - I don't believe it. That's crazy. I mean, that's crazy. Why would she tell you that? Do you lose your temper? No, I don't lose my temper! You're raising your voice right now. Yeah, because you're making ridiculous accusations! You're saying I'm abusing my daughter. It's difficult to be a single mom, and I can't imagine how much stress you must be under. Don't you dare make this about that. We'll give this one more chance, all right? But if I see as much as one bruise... or one scrape, I'll call protective services, am I clear? Yeah. Jon, I feel like I'm losing her, and I don't know what else to do. That's it. I'll see you in a couple hours. No, I can't ask you to do that. You're not doing this alone anymore, Alyson. I'll see you by 10:00. Okay, thank you. - Hey. - Oh! You scared me. Where's Lily? Why don't I take you to the store and buy you a new doll? I don't want a new doll. I want Lily! Claire! Why do you always hurt me, Mommy? Why? Oh, my God. Okay, let's see what we got. Ophelia? Would you like me to start with the abdomen? Sounds good. Want me to check it out? No, no, I'll go. Call maintenance and stay here. Hmm. Strange. Hello? Is there someone there? We need to get out of here. Ophelia? Ophelia? There's Daddy's little princess. I know what you want. Daddy's world-famous... flapjacks. - Morning. - Morning. Breakfast is almost ready. Can you get the juice? Yeah, sure. The campus has been on lockdown, as officers question anybody... - Here you go, sweetie. - who might have information helpful to this case. The classroom where the student was found belonged to Latin American studies professor Elena Carranza. Oh, my God. What? What, you knew her? She's the one I gave it to. The professor was not at her apartment. Efforts to reach her by phone have failed. Her colleagues and students are among those being questioned this hour... I gotta go. - Bill, back to you. - Thanks, Valerie. More from this breaking story later in our broadcast. Did your mother do that to you? Hurt your arm? Yes. How, Claire? How did she hurt you? I was in the kitchen, and I spilled my milk, and she just... she just finished cleaning up, and... and she got mad. Claire, I'm going to go and get a special report so I can write this down. I'm in the middle of something. I know, but someone left this in the front door. It's the Simon girl's doll, isn't it? - Who left it? - Don't know. I went to put the mail out, and it was just sitting there. Just keep it up front for me, okay? Sure. And there's another thing. It's about Zachary Orcutt. That's a lot of blood. Yeah, looks like our victim was killed up here, then dragged down to the desk. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm sorry, but Professor Carranza was a friend of mine, and I'm wondering if anyone has found a doll. A doll? Yeah, I came by, I dropped it off with her yesterday. She was looking into something for me. I'm gonna need you to leave. There's a detective outside that'll take your statement. Danny, can you please escort this woman out? Okay, but it's really important that you find this doll. - I need you to come with me. - Yeah, but... - Get her out of here. - Yeah, okay, I'm... Right this way. Sorry. Anyway, they dragged her from here to there. Right. And down the steps. Hello? I really need to talk to you about Claire. How soon can you get here? Halfway to the city is gonna be like another hour or two. I know you went to see Zachary Orcutt. You know I evaluated him for the court five years ago after he murdered his family. Okay. Why are you telling me this? Shortly after you spoke with him, Zachary Orcutt disappeared from his ward and hasn't been seen since. Are you telling me that Claire is in danger? Just get here as soon as you can. Jane, I need you to reschedule my next... Claire? Claire. Sweetheart? Sweetheart! Daddy? Just checking. Claire? Sweetheart? Claire, open the door! Claire! Claire! Hello? Hello! Claire? Sweetheart? Claire! Anybody here? Oh, my God! Claire? Claire! Claire, you open this door right now. Do you hear me? Claire, Daddy says open this door right now! Sweetheart? There's something else in here. Claire, give me the doll, sweetie. No. - Claire. - That's it. No! Daddy! Jonathan! Stop it, stop it! They're connected! Look. Don't do you look as the hearse goes by - Where'd it go? - Where is it? Where is she? Where is it? It's downstairs. Stay here. Stay here! I'd run if I were you. Claire? Claire! Claire! Oh, my God. No sign of it. We're going now! Don't just stand there. Move. Move! It's a prayer. It's not getting out anymore. - No! No! - Claire! You've got to get her out of here! Let me go! Let me go! - Where are we going? - Anywhere! Far from here! How's she doing? Fever still hasn't broken. - May I see her? - Yeah. You were right. There's a strong connection between Claire and the doll. Exactly what kind of connection are we talking about here? There are three stages. The first stage, the doll and the subject are introduced. In the second stage, the doll actually gets into the host's mind. It influences his or her thoughts, starts to change the way they behave. And the third and final stage, the doll and the host will meld. They'll become one. - Are we too late? - I don't think so. But I don't think we have much time either. Well, how about if we get her to a doctor? There's gotta be someone who could do something. It's very important that we handle this in a specific way. So it is possible to break the bond. I don't know. I thought if we got your daughter far away that it would free her, but I was wrong. The doll still has a hold on her. Then I'll destroy it. I'll go back to the house, and I'll destroy it. Jonathan... This time of night, I can be there in two hours. You can't. You can't! - Do you have any children? - No. Then you couldn't possibly know what it's like to sit there and watch your daughter suffer and do nothing about it. You're right, I can't, but what I do know is that if you don't dispose of this doll properly, whatever happens to that doll will happen to your daughter. If the doll dies, Claire dies. What is it that we need to do? What is the proper way? You have to remove the eyes first. If you remove the eyes from the doll, the connection with Claire should be severed. What do you mean, should? How many times do you think I've done this? Okay, then that's what we'll do. And when were done, I'm gonna burn the frickin' thing. No! - Come here, Claire. - Jonathan, be careful. - What? - Don't let her have it! You let her live! Jonathan! Oh, my God. Where is she? She's outside. Claire! - Claire! - Where is she? - I'll check over here. - Okay. We'll go this way. Claire! Claire? Stop! Claire, stop! Elena! Elena! Oh, my God. Get the tarp! Okay. Claire. Elena. Elena? We're gonna be okay. Hold on! Everybody okay? We have to find it. - I'll go get it. - You're not getting anything! - Claire. - Claire! Claire. Claire. Oh, my... Sweetheart. Just give Daddy the doll. There is no doll, Daddy. Claire, give Daddy the doll. No! Your daughter doesn't need you anymore, and neither do I. Alyson! Claire! Claire... Alyson! Goodbye, Mommy. No! - No! - The eyes! Can I help? Go upstairs and bring your mother's dresser down here. - You think you can handle that? - You're funny. No, there's some picture frames in the living room. You can grab those. Okay. - She doesn't remember anything? - Nothing. I mean, she remembers moving in here, but that's about it. Good. Let's keep it that way. You sure about this? About what? About us. Yeah. I'm sure. I love you. I love you. Come on. Let's go home. Okay. Don't you laugh as the hearse goes by
