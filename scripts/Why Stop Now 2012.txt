J'J' We got a problem here. What's the problem? - First, you don't have dirty urine. - Well, yeah, I mean, I was kinda getting ready to come into rehab. I haven't used in several days. - Second... - Yeah, well, what? You don't have insurance. Oh. - Penny, listen, you can't repeat what I'm gonna say to you. Okay. Go out, cop, get high, and bring me back some dirty urine, and I will fight to get you that bed. - You're telling me to go get high so I can get into rehab? That's the beautiful system we got, right? Ridiculous. J"J" Yo, w-what are you doing? - I don't qualify for detox rehab. You have to be high to get in here. You believe that crap? - Wait, how do you not? You abuse drugs, don't you? Doesn't that qualify you? You have to have insurance. I wait tables. They don't give us insurance. - I can't believe this. - I don't know. I feel like, you know, the government should help people. They want to get help, they should help 'em. - Oh, it's the government's fault, of course. It's the government's fault. Who else? Fuck Fuck! Fuck! Fuck. Now you are fucking up my day. - What-sweetie, what do you want me to do? - I want you to get your act together and get clean so I can leave, okay? I am sick of taking care of you!

You have to take care of Nicole, because if I get accepted, I leave in five weeks. I'll be gone for a year. A year? - Dave had to pull some strings just to get me the audition. So you have to get clean. Sweetie. It's a good school? Yeah. Yeah, it's a... it's a really serious school. Fuck...so... all right, so now what do we do? - You know, Eli, the guy in there, he tells me- and I know this is gonna sound crazy... Yeah? - But if I get high and can produce dirty urine, then I'm in. That's crazy, right? - Yeah, yeah, it is pretty crazy. All right. So let's do it then. Come on. Let's get you some crack or something. Come on. - Eli, I can't have you be a part of this. Mm-mm, no. - Mom, I'm already a part of this. I've been a part of this my whole life. Okay, so come on, you know what? I will pay for it. It'll be my treat, come on. Come on. - And I don't do crack, all right? You'd be a fool to do crack.

It's about to get wild and wooly in here. - Sweetie, I did not know I had this Oxy in the car. And what is this on my hand? People don't live in squalor like this no more, man. - Yeah, I guess they do, though, man. - Bunch of gypsies living here that don't wear shoes, 'cause it smell like feet.

Just a minute, Black. - We know you don't be playing golf. - Mom, he found the golf club. - Just put my things down. - There's actually a really funny story about that golf club. My mom tried to kill her boyfriend with one of those golf clubs. She hit him in the head with a nine iron. It was a seven. - Ha, ha, whack! Ow. I think it maybe rubbed him the wrong way, so he left us the house, and he moved to Florida. And Mom let him take my piano. - It was his piano. - It was my piano too. - No, not really. - Well... - Tried to kill your pops? - No... - No, it was just a flesh wound. - It was a flesh wound. That's why they ave him 47 stitches. No, no, no, she tried to kill Barry. That's Nicole's father. - Here you go, eat this. What is this? It's for your belly, sweetie. No, I don't eat jelly. I don't eat jelly for my belly. My pops was a junkie. Hey, Eli, stop it. No, no, no, he was a really- he was a really talented and famous guy. Guess what he was famous for? What? - What? Being a junkie. Thanks for everything, Dad, you jerk-off. - Eli, just stop it! - Okay. - Don't talk about your dad that way. He was a great artist, just like you're gonna be one day, sweetie.

I'm under his thumb. Look, Sprink. I'm not afraid of you. Nobody in this town is afraid of you. Why do you think I ripped you off? - Penny, I don't want you to be afraid of me. Oh, good. - But I do want you to know this: I'm not into hitting women, but I will fuck you up. Hey, now, wait a minute. - Come on, come on, okay, okay, okay. Okay, no, please excuse me.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Silly, yeah. - Okay. - Come on. Are you gonna be able to play? - Yeah, I'm gonna tear this shit up. I like this guy. He's crazy. Things have changed a lot since I went here. That was a long-ass time ago. - Wait a second. You guys went here too? - Yep, all-state track runner, two years in a rizzo, izzo. Wait, you actually ran track? - Fastest 1,500 in the state qualifiers. Come on, Penny, don't act like you don't remember. You know I was the man. - Mm-hmm, I bet you were super quick. - Look at this dude. He got on tights, Black! Yeah, I like that outfit. I dig them boots. Ridiculous. Everybody is all dressed up in costumes. Mom, stop. - No, honey, I'm just going to walk you in, okay? - No, no, no. Don't walk me in. What? No, no, no, stay here. Don't come in with me. No, I'm fine. Stop, and don't- don't come in, okay? Somehow you'd find a way to screw it all up. Stay here. - Okay, no, I'll just be right here then. Okay, fine, sorry. Thank you. Good luck, sweetheart! That was harsh. Yeah, that was cold-blooded. - He's just anxious about his audition, you know. That's why he's talking to me like that. Black, look, she hurt. Just got to deal with it. You getting ready to cry? - No. - She'll get over it. Earthlink.net. Look who's here. They're way off with their wardrobe, like, by two centuries. I mean, it's not even period.

A bunch of honkies playing dress-up. What's with you? - My kid, man, you don't know what this means to him. It means the world to him. He's never taken Oxy like that before. I mean, I don't know how he's doing in there. I don't know what's going on. I... - Wait, so you're actually, like... like, one of these people? - Reenactors? - Yeah. Yeah, my mom is a seamstress. My dad's a captain in the infantry. I'm the virginal daughter, Sarah Collins. - Really? You're a virginal daughter? That seems kind of... No, I'm kidding.

Well, you're his mother. You shouldn't be out here worrying. You're right about that. I'm going in. Me too. They probably still got my picture hanging. - All right, I'll stay out here with the car. I'll be right back, Black! Yeah. Hey, Miss Muffet, let me have one of them sandwiches. Give me a sandwich. J"J" Okay. J"J" - Hey. - You're almost late. Are you trying to make me nervous or what? - I'm here. I'm here. What's with the hand? - Nothing, nothing. I'm fine. - I've been teaching for 15 years.

I'm not a genius. - No? - No. No, I'm not buying that. Not even for two dollars. Nobody does anything great without they heart not being into it. What I want to know is, what does that do for your heart? It lets me disappear. I get it. - Yeah, I imagine it's the same when you run a race, right? Like, what do you think about? - Nothing. Just the finish line. Yeah, and I know. The finish line, but... for that minute and a half, what do you think about? Think about nothin'. I just ran. There you go. You're a smart little fucker. Yeah.

Thank you. More fun than I would have imagined. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah. Absolutely. Come on, baby. I danced real good. No, no, listen, hold on. Listen, we got to go in the bathroom first and do this, okay? I don't need to do that, baby. I have not felt this good in a long, long time. I feel great. I'm gonna be fine. - Whoa-you're gonna be fine? - Totally. - What are you talking about? I'm not asking you, okay? I'm telling you, okay? You're gonna go in the bathroom. You're gonna do this. We're gonna go to rehab. I don't care if I have to force this down your throat. - First of all, sweetie, you don't eat it. You snort it up your nose. - Whoa, don't-don't touch me. I don't care what you do with it. Just put it in your body, okay? - You don't understand, Eli. I don't need to go to rehab. For crying out loud, I'm clean, and I can stay clean on my own. There's nothing to worry about. I am not doing this! I am not having this conversation with you for literally the one millionth time! - Oh, come on. You've got a drinking problem. You want to have that conversation? No, I don't. - You get wasted every single weekend, two, three times a week. You're sucking down tequila right now, sweetie. You know what I think, Eli? I think you have a problem. So why don't you go into the bathroom? You do the drugs, and you go to rehab, because I am fine! You are not fine! You are a liar. And you are a junkie. Eli. Eli, what the- - You! Let those prisoners go! - Take your British hands off me. - Chloe! Hey! Hey, Chloe! - Eli? - Chloe. - Eli! - Chloe. Hey. Hi. Why are you tied up? Do you want me to free you? - Yes, free us. - Shut up! We're part of the story. The British burned down my house and kidnapped me and my sister. - Oh, my God. Are your-are your parents okay? My dad got shot. My mom's missing, and they stole all of our livestock. - Really? All the livestock? - Yes! - Oh, no. Wow. God, all those poor cows and chickens, Jesus. Well, that's terrible, and the British are assholes. I hope they lose. How was the audition? Uh, not so good, but I'm-l'm so glad I found you. - Young sir, stand down there. - Uh, yeah, me too, but, Eli, you should not be here. This is, like, a big part of the event, and I don't want to piss anybody off. Back away! - You are, like, this beam of white light. You have no idea. - Stand down, young hooligan! - Stop, no, seriously, you are, like, this little revolutionary semi-virginal angel. It is so adorable. Um... That's really sweet, Eli. I like you too. I mean, I've always liked you. But you cannot be here. They're gonna burn you alive if you stay. I told you away! - Why can't I stay here? Why can't I stay here? I could be the strapping young peasant trying to win the affection of the golden virgin, Sarah Collins. I could rip my clothes and rub dirt on my face and be someone else. I could be someone else too! Stand down from the wagon! You're not dressed right! It's really sweet that you want to be a part of this, but not now. Maybe next year. My dad can always use a good soldier! - Okay. - You! Step away! Wait, wait, do you remember when we were in eighth grade biology and I asked you if it was a maple leaf or an oak? Don't hurt him! - No, no, I knew what kind of leaf it was. You said maple, but it wasn't a maple, and it wasn't an oak. It was a sumac! It was a sumac tree. And I knew what it was, but I figured if I asked you enough questions, you'd have to talk to me at some point, because- please, please let me go- because I thought you were so beautiful. Be gone! Cajole that wagon right now! - I'm going, all right? I surrender. Okay, okay. Okay- - Come back later! I'll be here. Okay, good-bye, Sarah Collins! Okay, don't push me. Bye, piano man. - I'm sorry if I ruined your war, everybody. All right. - That was so romantic. - Oh, my God, I know. I never expected anything like that. - I mean, it's like he learned how to be hot. Um, yeah. - Hello? - Eli, I'm gonna kill her! - Whoa. - Get over here! - Wait, Mom. Mom, slow down. Hurry up! Okay, all right, okay. Just don't do anything stupid, okay? - Take aim! Fire! You're acting insane! That's my daughter! Oh, Eli! Thank God! She has Nicole locked in there! Oh, Jesus. - All right, I came over here just to get my daughter, right? Yeah. - And, Eli... - What? - She is not coming out of here. I'll tell you that. - Hey! - Shut up! - Hey, Mom. - She says to me- Eli, listen to me! - What? - She says that Nicole would be better off living here with her! - Yeah, that's absolutely insane. Exactly what I'm saying. What? - Calm down, okay? And go over here. Go over here. Trish? Come on out of there. - I just want to take Nicole home. - I absolutely will not. I am afraid of her. - She's afraid of you. - Afraid of me? - Yes, afraid of you. - What did I do? - Look at yourself! Now, calm down. Trish! Hey. - Eli... - Trish, you can come out now. It's fine. I'm here. Just come out, okay? - I want her away from the door. - She's away from the door. Stay there. - I'm way over here, Trish, on the other side of the room! - Mom, calm down, okay? Grow up. Come out. It's fine. All right, just relax. - Ohh, baby! - Mommy! - Every single time she comes over... - Trish, Trish. - She makes a scene! - Every single time. - Please, don't start. - Oh, a scene? Want to see a scene? Next time you try to take my daughter, I will come here and burn down your house! - That is a fine thing to say in front of two small children. You are scaring them! - You shut up too. Sit down! Sit down! Mom, sit down, and you shut up too! The both of you! Stop talking! Stop talking and stop talking. - In my own home! - Shut up, okay? Jesus Christ, I am so fucking sick of this shit! Okay, Trish, you have to stop patronizing her, okay? Get off your high horse and show your sister a little compassion. I am so tired of this, okay? And I know she is a pain in the ass. Yes, she is. - But you are a pretentious pain in the ass, all right? No. Stop! You have a very nice house, and you have a very nice car, and you have a very nice television set, but Nicole does not belong here, okay? She doesn't. She belongs at her home with her own mother. - Fine. - Good. - Thank you, Eli. - Okay, okay, good. And, Nicole, this sock puppet thing, it's gotta stop. - Oh, no. This helps her, sweetie! I've told you. No, no, it doesn't help her when Julio tells people to fuck off and calls them names. That's not good. He is right about that. - Hey, if I wanted your help, I would ask for it. Thank you very much. Nicole, seriously. It's gotta stop. Do I, Mommy? Oh, sweetie, no, you don't have to get rid of Mario, but what if he was kinder to people, huh? "Oh, Eli, that's a very nice tie you have on." - Okay, Mom. Mom, stop it, okay? Nicole is not coming home unless you get help. All right? And if you don't do that, then... - Honey... - And if you don't that- Please, stop it! If you don't get help, then... Well, I don't know what's gonna happen to us, actually.
