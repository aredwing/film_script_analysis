Get that camera off me! 5-80-pro times four, got about a dozen more in the car. Check. Head cam set times three - that's one, two... Where the hell is the other one? Ah, modelled by the handsome man in the mirror. What else? Got my LED, two D - yes. My work light - yes. Fuck it, let's get some coffee. Bollocks. Alright, mate. You're Deacon? I'm Gray. Hi. - I'm the tech specialist. You not worked with one before? Well, basically I'm in charge of the camera, the microphones, all that kind of stuff. What do you make of the luxury cottage? Right now running water sounds like luxury. You're not local? - Fuck, no. Christ, I couldn't live around here. There's no Wi-Fi, no broadband, no cable. Basically it's like the middle ages. You wanna see the room? - Yeah, that'll be good. Come on. Me and you are in here, man. We're sharing? We're sharing? - Yeah, well, the main man gets the master bedroom. Do you know him? Something Amidon. Mark? - Yeah, that's it. Great. - I left a load of crap on your bed, but I'll sort all that out. You want a beer? Tell you what, you sort out the bed and I'll put the kettle on. Well, I didn't do a Breathalyzer test but he seemed sober enough. For a Scotsman anyway. Yeah, I know, I am serious. It just makes me uncomfortable, all this Big Brother shit. I'm a techie, mate. If you want your audio clean, your white balance shiny, then I'm your man, but... Yeah, yeah, yeah, the bonus is very generous, but... By the way, is that gonna be paid in cash? Because it makes the paper work a bit... Oh, I'd better go. I made you tea. - Cheers, mate. Women, ey... - I wouldn't know. Deacon! Deacon, come on, mate. Let's get you kitted out. This is ridiculous. - Well maybe, but it's also regulations. Oh come on, mate. I've been wearing mine two days already and I can barely even notice it's there anymore. That's it. - You probably enjoy it. Right, listen. Rule number one: I am not wearing this in the toilet, not unless the toilet is weeping blood or something. Alright, fine. When you have a poo or a shower you can take it off, but the rest of the time they want it on, alright? I've been promoted to tripod. It's all been since Belem. Apparently they had massive gaps in the timeline at Belem and they wanna plug them using these. Morning. - Yeah. Crap- Deacon, where's your head cam? Look mate, it's not you who gets it in the neck, alright? Please. I'll sort that out. Please. What have you done here? Get a wiggle on, mate. Yep, alright. - What are you doing? Going to have a fag. You mind if I smoke? - Yes. Excuse me... What? You know it's like, you can't imagine this place is gonna be the stuff of legend, like the Arthurian legend in years to come. - Name me a place that is. Camelot? Betting shop, fish bar, laundry. That's life in miniature. Food, cleanliness and a little bit of naughty. So how long you've worked for the congregation, Deacon? So I imagine you must have seen a lot of insane and spooky stuff. I don't know about you dude, but I'm looking forward to seeing some really wired shit. Is there anything I should... - Yeah. Don't get your hopes up. Dude, have you just bought booze? It's gone, it's back, it's gone, it's back. It's gone, it's back! Come here. Where are we? - Hang on, where are we... The village, the church... Right, that's the cottage just there and there's the church. Look on the map. You know the sign for a church, don't you? It's a little round thing with a cross, see if you can find it. It's in this area here. You can't just dial it into a computer. "Nutsley". Yeah well, that's not where the church is. Look here! "Bullshurst". "Bullcone". "Bullcone". "Bullcone". Yeah, it says "Bullcone". Nah. - Dude, come on! No, good luck. No really, it's fine. You go for it. I'll come back. You're a misery guts! - I'll come back. No, alright, I'll get the corners done, then you can do the fun bit - filling in the middle. Yeah, perfect, okay. I'll see you around March! I got a corner! It's a bit late for the bells, isn't it? Yeah. Dude, the rules are very clear. We need to wait for the -what's his name?- the Realtor General, Amidon. Relator, and he should've been here yesterday. Dude, even so. - Right, fine. I'm now going up to the site. But you know I'm not very technical inclined. I just hope all this delicate equipment doesn't... - Dude, calm down, man! You've ever known any Buddhists, Deacon? Sorry? - Have you ever known any Buddhists? I had a girlfriend who was a Buddhist; she did a vow of silence, it was fucking brilliant! You know, the accelerator is not an on-off button, Gray. It's something you can press and depress gently. Yeah, well, I just turn around. There we go. Thanks mate. Tit! Are we there yet? - No, fucking sat-nav's fucked. It has taken us in a massive shitty circle. Yeah, ask this fella here. He looks like an agreeable local bumpkin type. Hi, can you tell us where the church is round here please? Yeah, you know, it's a big pointy building with a spire on top. Please be quiet. - God's house! Please be quiet. - Alright. His name's father Crellick. Right, okay... Thanks very much for your time. Sorry to bother you. Have a cracking day, mate! - Have a good trip. Good luck with it! Can you smell that? It's cows. I hate cows. Why do people do this? Satanists, supposedly. They record messages on them. Spells, curses, that sort of thing... - Curses? I got it. Oh dude. That's nature for you, Deacon. Big stuff eating little stuff. One glance in the bible will tell you that. Or take the miracle of Lanciano. In the year 700 a Basilian monk had doubts over the actual physical presence of Jesus Christ in the holy Eucharist. While he was performing the ceremony, before his eyes the bread and the wine transformed into chunks of living flesh. The question is: Do you give cows names? My mate at school, Scott Andrews, he said he gives his cows names, or did when he was a kid, and then they couldn't kill them. They got like attached to them and then that cow ended up living with them for like about 14 years - the life span of a cow. They said it was a massive pain in the arse. Cheery stuff. You alright? I'm alright, yeah. Just hanging with my home boy. Afternoon, Barry. Father Crellick? I think you've been expecting us. Oh yes, of course! I wasn't sure what time you'd be arriving. The Relator General has been delayed but I'm Deacon and this is Gray. Alright. I was under the impression that you fellows would make me feel underdressed. "You all shall be dressed in humility, for God resists the proud" "and gives grace to the humble." I'll show you where it happened. - Thank you. The decision of dedication that you make today is one of the most sacred and significant you may declare. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy... What's that? Father... That is mental! Have you seen this? - Yes. That is nuts! It's great. So how long have you been here, father Crellick? This has been a project of mine for a few years now. The diocese finally acquiesced and we opened just over two months ago. These are the church records you asked for. Great, thanks. I don't quite understand. These cameras, are they necessary? We have to fully investigate every claim. Claim? What claim? We all saw it! It was a very impressive video, father Crellick, else we wouldn't be here. It's not brain surgery. It's a fundamentally simple kit. HD cameras. In this case: pro 5-80s. Electric screwdriver - one for me, one for you. Okay. It's getting late. Fancy a drink? - Yeah. Evening. - Evening. Gray, let's get these off, yeah? You got Wi-Fi here by any chance? Dude, I can't believe that video. That's nuts. I must have watched that 50 times today. What happens if we actually find something? If we see something we report it and then they decide whether to follow it up. What, that's it? - Yeah, that's it. And then we're onto the next job. We're here to observe and report. We don't make the decisions. They only recognize miracles in very, very few cases. Look, we get a lot of time wasters. - But that video is impressive. I mean, you said that yourself! No, no, no, it is, definitely! I didn't think father Crellick had it in him. I thought we would have seen the strings. You're saying all that was fake? - Yes. What, all the stuff? Even that thing at the end? - What - on the camera? I don't know. It was a glitch or something. So that girl in Spain last year, with the stigmata. You can't fake that. - No, I was there for that one. And? - Fake. No it wasn't. - And not a very good one. Dude, you can't fake stigmata, there are holes in your hands. So what was it - hidden blood capsules or something? No, it was much simpler. Every day for ten weeks the girl's mother cut her hands and feet open. The girl got septicemia. Do you know what her mother said to me after she died? Now you can make my girl a saint. I see his nibs has arrived. My dear brother Deacon. The prodigal son returns. You are still one of us, aren't you, Deacon? Hello Mark, how's is the Vatican these days? You should really come and see for yourself once in a while. And this must be our technical specialist. I'm Father Amidon. Alright, how're you doing? - Call me Mark. A pleasure. - Sorry about the delay, I was at a fundraiser in Boston. I'm really intrigued to see the set up. We've got all the cameras set up on site. - The regulations clearly state that the entire team must be in place before commencing anything. That would mean... - Don't blame him, Mark. It was my idea. - Why am I not surprised about that? Yeah, well... Church records. Thought they might be useful. Right. Gray. Yeah. Night, mate. You'll be wanting to fit my head cam, no doubt. Yeah, sure. He can be very persuasive, our brother Deacon. He doesn't really like taking orders. All you need to remember, Gray, is who's in charge. Right. Chip forks, tartar, ketchup, what not. Tuck in. Did you hear that? Listen! You're imagining things. - Let's eat, it's getting cold. What the fuck is that? - Where's the fire extinguisher? Are you alright? Stay back, stay back! What is it? What happened? What are you doing? Deacon? - It's a sheep. A what? - A sheep. Dear God! I don't know. - Is that blood? Oh, these kids. Oh my God. Just keep breathing. It's okay... An incident. Well, someone killed an animal, a sheep, outside our cottage. They set fire to it. They, they burnt it. The poor creature was in agony. No, I didn't see the people who did it. It was kids, I think. Kids from the village. Our Father who is in heaven, who has shown us this glorious miracle in your house of worship. Please show yourself again! "Our father who art in heaven," "hallowed by thy name." "Thy kingdom come." "Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." "Give us this day our daily bread." "And forgive us our trespasses," "as we forgive those who trespass against us." "And lead us not into temptation," "but deliver us from evil." You still up? - Yeah, can't sleep. You gonna wear that thing to bed? No, I'll stick it on charge in a minute. You alright, Deacon? Yeah. You? Yeah, I'm alright... What are you reading? - What's this? It's a journal from Dr. Pritchard Mandeville. Now he was the last minister of the church before it closed around 1880. Apparently the Lord came to him in these dreams and called him here and told him to open an orphanage nearby. Let's have a look. "A curious town, none too pleasant for it." "The locals are a solemn bunch and the skies are leaden grey." Well, I know how he feels. You know, I thought I was gonna get sent home earlier on. Listen, I wouldn't worry about it. Mark just likes to do things by the book. He's probably not best pleased that one of the team members isn't even religious. Hey, I believe in stuff, just not as much as you two. Yeah, well, he'll come round. Or you will. Father Crellick, nice to meet you at last. You do look a little tired, Father Crellick. Are you alright? You know, it wouldn't do any harm if you went away for a day or two, think about something else. We will be very thorough, I assure you. We will need full access to the church. Of course. The keys to the kingdom. Father Crellick has left the site. Now we're going to examine the altar. Church built around 1260. It's a small parish enclave on top of a hill. And here's the crucifix. Solid enough, nothing hidden underneath. Yeah, it might not be the same one. Could be a duplicate. Note: Must cross check crucifix against video footage. Are you mental? I mean, Crellick was standing here, right? And he was holding a baby. How's he gonna move all that lot? - You mean, how did he move all that lot? I can't believe you two are so sure it was him. Hang on. Yep, I've got an idea. There you go. Ah, there it is. - What? - See it? - No. Wind the tape back. Right, watch it again. Look at the altar table. The water, it's vibrating. Exactly! A speaker under the altar would do that. And there's definitely some fixture holding something under there. What, like a subwoofer? - Yeah. You saw the size of his congregation? This is his chance for notoriety. You know, headline in the local newspaper, maybe a bit in the evening news. People will start flocking back in, and even if eventually the Vatican doesn't recognize the miracle - well, by then the coffers are full. Yeah, some of these people think they are doing the church a favour, when in reality all they are doing is dragging us back to the dark ages. Right, we're going to set up a grid to cover the space. You take the left transcept, I'll take the right. Hang on, what are we looking for? Well, anything that doesn't fit. You know, recent repairs, wires in the wall. Just something that doesn't look right. You are thinking hidden speakers, like in... Yes. That's better across there, like that. - Alright? Sweet. What's that? - What, this? It's for detecting magnetic fields. It can pick up any hidden speakers in the walls larger than like a pair of earbuds. Earbuds? - Yeah, headphones, Mark. Are you two making that noise? Are you scraping off paint? - Eh? Not me, dude. I got you, Deacon, I got you! No, Deacon's alright when you get to know him. I mean, he seems on top of it if you ask me. He's... Yeah, alright, he likes a drink. But I mean, he's just having a sip of the communion wine, so it's all kosher. Look, booze just relaxes him. Well, I mean, priests are an uptight bunch and he's got a lot on his mind. That Crellick, he's a few rosaries short of a crucifix. Hello? Hello? Fucking dog bollocks. There it is again. Is that one of you two? What? - Shhh, listen! Gray? Here lies the body of Samuel Shortage, aged 62. Not a bad innings, I suppose. It seems... to be coming from over there. "Wrapped up in linen. All wrapped up in linen and cold as clay." "So beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly." What the fuck... That's fucking weird. What the fuck... Oh fucking hell, fucking hell... What is that? Gray! That sodding dog! - Where? I dunno, I think he ran off. Up you come. I honestly thought some five year old girl must have broken her leg. I don't know what kind. It was a big one. - What, like a dachshund? It wasn't a dachshund. It was like the hound of the fucking Baskervillesl Mark! Mark! Don't move, Mark. Open your eyes! He's got blood in his ear. - Right. Gray, take him outside, sit him down and stay with him. Stay with him! - All I need is a little air. You look peaky, Mark. Mark! - What? Why don't you go and see a doctor? It's just an in-ear thing. I must have ruptured my ear drum on the flight. It happens... No, I heard it too. It was like this weird rasping, scratchy noise, a bit like that. - Okay, okay, it was rats. Hardly unusual in an old building. Can I just go on the record please and say that Mark should go and see a doctor! Right, I'm going to bed. I need to write up my report. Deacon - I mean what is he, a Christian or a Christian scientist? So Gray, how did you come to be working for the congregation? I saw it on a tech recruitment website. Sounded cool, money was good. They did ask me if I was a believer. And I said: "yeah". You lied. Well... You know, I wasn't brought up religious. But you know, I believe in... stuff. I mean today, right, in the church - didn't you feel... something? A presence? - Well, it is a church. I'll get you a beer. - Okay. Deacon! Yes? - What happened in Belm? No. Dude, I'm gonna keep hassling you if you don't tell me, okay? I'm gonna badger you if you don't tell me. Cough it! Belm. Bethlehem in English. - Right. It's a town in Northern Brazil. Well, there was a shrine there that was getting a reputation as a new Lourdes. Cardinal Prefect Renaldi himself led the investigation. When they arrived they were amazed. There was a queue of sick people outside the shrine waiting to be healed. And... did they see anyone get healed? Better. They saw God. Right. Now we started getting really confused reports from Renaldi... which barely made any sense. And then... Then they disappeared. Renaldi? Yeah, Renaldi. The Vatican, they went crazy. It's like a high ranking cardinal and his team had just vanished. Their bodies turned up in the jungle a few days later. So what happened? - The autopsy reports revealed "atypical chemical traces". - So what does that mean? They what - they got poisoned? - My guess: Dimethyltryptamine, D.M.T.. Powerful hallucinogenic, plant- derived. The shamans there have been using it for millennia. Maybe the priests had a bad reaction to it and the locals panicked and dumped the bodies. Or... maybe... they actually saw God. Hold up your beer bottle. No, no, side on. Let me show you. There, hold it up like that. That's it, put your hand on top like that. Alright? - Perfect. Now are you watching? Here we go. Dude... Yeah... Don't believe everything you see, Gray. Good night. What the fuck... Father, give me the strength to resist evil. Please protect this house and prevent evil from entering. I need your strength, and the strength of your Son, Jesus Christ. Strengthen my faith and sacrifice this holy place... Please let me be strong... Strengthen my power and my faith for this ordeal... "More cages. Sick to my core. The dreams drew me here." "Perhaps always him. I beseech you reader, leave this place!" "This village, a painted facade." "He lies beneath ever hungrier for souls." And this bit: "Now I see the perfect hideous logic" "of the orphanage." "I may have a new master now." And that's it. That's the last thing he wrote. Does any of that mean anything to you? - No. No, but I'll tell you something: I don't think it's an accident that Mandeville's journal ended up in the church records. I think Crellick put it there. I think he wanted us to find it because we would read it and understand something. Something that Crellick couldn't or wouldn't tell us. But what that is I've no idea. Right, come on, Mark. Let's go! Mark? Mark? Mark? Deacon, look at his ear. Mark. Mark! Listen, we'll just let him sleep it off. The walk will do him good. Please leave me. It's open. I heard the voices again last night. Father Crellick! Did you sleep here? Were those voices coming from over here, Father Crellick? Looks like those kids have played a wee trick on you. You think I'm a fool, don't you? We want this to be a miracle just as much as you do, dude. No, you don't. I'm not like Mandeville. If there is anything in this church this will help us find it. I mean, if a poltergeist farted in here six months ago we will hear it. This is ghost hunting equipment, is it? - Well, okay. You know how you said that when you heard the sound it seemed to move? - Yeah. Well, these are radio mics and they've got an analogue receiver. It's got dials, okay? That means you can tune between frequencies. And that's good? It's where stuff hides. Where did you hear the sound? Huh? - Where did you hear the sound? Well, it was there and then it moved over to there. Okay. We put one mic here, in the pulpit. We put one mic over here, let's say in the middle of these books. We put one mic somewhere here, on the high altar. And then you can tune in- between the three of them? We can then tune between all three, we can hear three dimensionally what's going on in this space. And we can put some further around here? We've got 12 in total. Pick your spots. Okay. Mic check. Mic one, check. Can you hear me? - Yeah. No, I mean you can hear me, but can you hear it on the receiver? Oh, sorry. - Tune it round to 100. On the dial, the big dial. Cool. Yeah, that will be good, that's where Mark had his fall, wasn't it? It's dirty work down here, mate. Right, mic two, check. - Mic two, check! Mic seven, check. Yeah, hearing it. Mic seven, roger. Dude, listen. Listen. Let me get a hold on that. Alright, that's... No, that's mic two. Is it moving? Dude, what is that? It's moving, it's moving along this wall. Now what? - Now it's going towards the bookcase. Just there. That's right there, dude. What is that - an animal? Is that a voice? No, it's gone. It's totally gone. You've checked all this for speakers, haven't you? Dude, it was along this wall here. It moved along here. And you've checked that for speakers? There is nothing in there, dude? Hi Mark, you feeling better? I'm fine. It's definitely over here. - That's between mics three and four. Right. - Hold on. Heading towards mic three. Listen. 12:05h, sound of infant crying. Most likely interference from a nearby baby monitor. Gray, Gray! Dude. What's going on? That was Father Crellick, I just saw him skulking about in the window over there. I knew it was too good to be true. Something tangible happens and he just so happens to be there. Dude, we've checked for subwoofers and didn't find any. How's he gonna...? - Maybe he went basic. Loop of fishing line, out the loop and then whip it away again. - That's bullshit, it's too involved. He didn't even seem with it. Gray, you don't know that. - I know it doesn't feel nice to be deceived. I'm going to follow him, see what he's up to. This might be us finished. Father Crellick? I've got to say it pains me to say it but Mark's theory about that baby monitor is probably correct. It's the best explanation. No, dude. I switched this off. What? Dude, the machine is switched off! Father? Are you there? Father Crellick? Father Crellick? You don't believe in my miracle, do you? I prayed for you to come. If this is not a miracle, if this is not the hand of God... I can hear it! Where's it coming from? Fuck, dude! - What? Calm down. I'm not your enemy here. But if this isn't a miracle... Get out of here! Father Crellick... Oh Christ! Deacon! Gray! - We're coming! What's going on? Mark, Mark! Where are you? Fuck! Guys! Oh fuck! Oh God! Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Oh fuck! - Father Crellick. "Christ almighty and his holy mercy, may the Lord Father assist you." The... the police are with Mark now. I wouldn't worry, he can be quite the salesman when he wants to be. I just don't understand it, Deacon. What don't you understand? Crellick. That's a sin, right? According to you lot. - A mortal sin. A mortal sin. The souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell. Into hell. But... Crellick was a priest. Priests can be sinners too. Come on, I'm buying. Oh, here we go. Just keep walking, Deacon. Dude... Not so funny now, is it? Is it? - He's bleeding! Dude, that was unnecessary. Deacon! They're just kids, mate. Cheers, love. Take it easy. - Another one, please! Just don't tell Mark, okay? Holy people struggle too, you know? Open a newspaper, we all make bad choices, same as everyone else. Yeah well, jumping off a church tower sounds like the wrong choice. He was under a lot of pressure. Pressure? But Deacon. Mark might want to hide his head in the sand, but you... You know better, I know you do. What we saw up there... Two more, please. - Deacon, what we saw up there was not normal. It was not fucking normal, mate. The people that came before you lot, right... The pagans. - Yeah alright, the pagans, druids, the Aztecs or whatever. They believed in stuff that was real. You know, they had the moon, the sea, the stars, the sun. They had stuff, they worshipped stuff! They didn't know any better. They were just worshipping what was in front of them. No, they worshipped what was there, physically there. Whereas you are choosing to believe and worship the great "what if". And your point is? - Well, my point is... My point is, that if there was gonna be a fight between something that was there and something which wasn't there, then I know which side I'd bet on. What? Are you... What? - Hey, can we get some drinks here, please? Don't make a face, Deacon. - Bar's closed. Come on, it's just after nine. - My pub, my rules. Ah, come on, don't be ridiculous! - You just served this guy. A man is dead. A good man. I know his mum, you should see the state of her. Yeah, we don't want any trouble, lads. The only people causing trouble around here are you. Look... Deacon, hey, dude, dude, dude! No! Dude, dude, dude! - We were asked here. We came here to help! - Help? Dude, let's go! Deacon, come on, dude! - I've been there before, Gray. Everyone's trying to sweep the truth under the carpet. I'm not gonna let it happen again. We've got to go back up there. Where have you been? - Listen, Mark, mate, we had a thought about where the sounds were coming from. So we went to investigate... - Investigation's over. You can go and pack away your stuff. I've sent in a revised report, all we're doing is waiting on the movement order. Mark, come on, mate... - This is not over! Really? Well, if you can tell me which one of the awful events we witnessed constitutes a miracle, I will be sure to inform my undersecretary. But... - There is nothing going on at that church but a depressed priest with misguided notions and now he's dead. If you still think it's Crellick then why don't we go back up there? If nothing happens, then we will know for sure! - A priest is dead! I am not going to let this turn into another campfire story. It's right there! We get in there and we... I told him there's something there! Now we've got it in our grasp and he wants to go. "Waiting by the quayside..." "...in your home, boy. Let her go." "Go, boy..." Shit! Hello? Hello? Who's there? Father Crellick? Deacon. Deacon. Father Crellick? What's that? Jesus Christ. Sick bastards. Oh shit, shit! Deacon, what are you playing at? What? Who said that? Oh my God. My God. Where's it coming from? What is that? Who's there? Who's there? Frazzetti. Frazzetti's eyes.. Oh God, his eyes! As if we didn't have enough on. We should be on our way to Liege right now. The situation is not resolved. - It was according to my report. Reconsecration is a matter for the local diocese. Why are you ignoring what happened? What I found? - What, some old animal bones and you imagined you heard something. - Which warrants further investigation! It wasn't your call to make. - Yeah, well, somebody had to! Well, somebody is going to be facing serious disciplinary procedures when this is over. - Right. This is your last mission with the congregation, Deacon. I'll make bloody sure of that. Father Umberto Calvino, he was my tutor. He heads up the Vatican archives now, all very hush hush. You don't have to tell me, dude. I've read "The Da Vinci Code". Grazie. - Father Calvinol Very nice flight, I enjoyed that. Calvino's an expert in church history. All the stuff that's been swept under the holy carpet. Right. They've been trying to get rid of him for years, but when this kind of thing comes along, - He's a useful man to have in your corner. The best. Padre Deacon! - Padre Calvino! Grazie. So Padre, looking at all the information, both the event and the timeline, most of it is audio - although there is some physical, if we include the moving cross. Why are you suddenly including that now? - Well, in the light of the new circumstances, the new evidences... - What new evidences? You haven't found anything! - He knew about Frazzetti! Frazzetti. Frazzetti's eyes.. Oh God, his eyes! You could have been saying those things, we never see your face. Oh really? What, in Crellick's accent? Why would I want to mention Frazzetti? Guys, who is Frazzetti? He worked for the congregation. He was in Belem. He was second in command, under Deacon. Wait - Deacon was in Belm? - Gray... Deacon likes to edit the story to make him less culpable. When he got there each and every one of the priests was still alive. All he had to do was bring them home, but he couldn't resist meddling. The scammers thought they'd been discovered and murdered each and every one of them. Would have murdered Deacon too if he wasn't drunk that night. Alright, but "Frazzetti's eyes" - what does that mean? During the visions, Frazzetti was unable to deal with what he was seeing. He cut his own eyes out. Look, okay fine, I will see this through, okay, but then I am done! I'm going back to corporates. It's boring but it's a lot less grief! Because Deacon has been lying to me and because you've been lying to me. I mean, do any of you people tell the fucking truth? I don't give a monkey's about the bonus! You can give that to the fucking poor or something! You know what? Dan Brown was right about you lot! You can stick your hail Marys up your fucking arse! Oh, he's gone. Oh well, ciao Signore. So Father Amidon. Relator General, no less. I always knew you would rise far. I don't want you to think that I resent your presence here but Deacon had no authority to make that call. I still don't understand why you would want to travel all this way. He may be insubordinate but he may also be correct. Do you know of Pope Gregory's letter to Mellitus? Mellitus? He was sent by Gregory on a mission to bring Christianity to the pagans of England. Gregory wrote: "By no means destroy the temples of the heathen gods" "but rather the idols that are within those temples." "When you have purified them with holy water, place altars there." You're saying the church used to be a pagan temple? No, no, not the building. But the ground. This site has always been a site of significance. What is present at this place is older than the church, older than Christianity. - So what is it, like an evil spirit? A demon? - Two words for the same thing. Once people worshipped it as a god. The Church came along and drove it out, they called it the Antichrist. It does not matter what we call it. But now it has returned, like weeds that creep through an abandoned building. Do you know what the foundation of friendship is, Deacon? Yes. It's trust, mate. It's trust, alright? I know that... - I have to sit there... I have to sit there listening to your stories, alright, and we're bonding, I think we're bonding. There were reasons I didn't tell you the truth. Yeah, well, it turns out it's all bollocks! We are near. Gray. Gray. It was a mistake. - No, mate. A mistake is when you spill a drink or drop your phone in the toilet. What you did was a lie, mate. - Let's put this into perspective, okay? I didn't kill those men. But I was warned and I ignored it. And seven priests died. I am going to have to live with that for the rest of my life. Let's go. Can you feel that? I don't like this. Padre, I've seen this symbol before. Yes, in the pagan times many different gods were worshipped in different regions. This symbol represents a deity of the people who were here. Which deity? There is so much we don't know. Even the name of this pagan god eludes us. But this symbol is all we need - for the banishment ceremony. This is ridiculous. This isn't even a Christian ceremony. For the very first time I have seen things here I can't explain. "In vino veritas". - Yeah, sure. Mark, Mark! What about the baby? We both heard that and the radios were off. - Ferric oxide. What? - I read of caves in France where people heard sounds. Turns out the walls of the caves were rich in ferric oxide. When the walls resonated at the right frequency, they gave out sounds like a primitive tape recorder. - That's bullshit! Why is it after all you've seen you continue to cling to bizarre and desperate theories? Desperate theories? It's scientific reasoning what we do. Maybe so, but we're also representatives of the church! Are you questioning my faith? One question: Do you accept there are things happening in this church, things beyond science? - No! You know what, I'm a virtuous man. I follow the teachings of Jesus. But that's not enough, is it? I'm supposed to believe in magic now, supposed to believe the world was created in six days, believe in empty rituals. Well, I don't! And it's high time the Church got rid of these alienating medieval superstitions. All that remains is the finishing ritual. "In nomine Patris et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti." "In nomine Patris et Filii..." Get away! - Did you hear that? Get away! Go back! Go back! I command you! Mark? Mark? Mark. Mark, can you hear me? Are you okay? Gray, can you hear? Are you hurt? - Where's Father Calvino? Father Calvino! Father Calvino! Father! Father Calvino! Shit! Shit! Please, please! Come on, you fucker! I'm not in this! Goddamn it! Deacon? Deacon! Deacon! Fuck... Deacon! -Jesus! - Deacon! -Jesus! Shit! - Oh God! Okay, Gray, come here. Now look at me! Now you need to calm down! - Okay. Dude, have you seen Mark? Mark? - Yeah. I think he wandered down here. He was there one minute, then he was just fucking gone. I'm going to take the light away now. - Okay. Stay right behind me. - Let's just get the fuck out of here, man! Father Calvino! - You said he came down here? I don't know. I think so. What the fuck is that? Right, right, right. What if it's not Calvino? What if it's not Calvino? Padre! Padre? What's that? - It's a signal relay, for the head cams. I can ping each unit with this. - Is that good? It might be handy if we ever want to get out of here. Let's go. There's more blood on the floor. What's that? It's... it's Calvino's. There's more blood, Gray. We should go back. We should get a search party. No, I can find him myself. It's wrong down here, Deacon. It's just echoes. There are no monsters, no devils. It's not real Gray, it's not real. Come on. Fuck... fuck! Okay. Dude, my ears have just popped! Yeah, I think we're going deep. Deep into the hill. What on earth... What is this? "Please God, save them and forgive me. I have a new master now." It's Mandeville. - What would Mandeville be doing down here? Gray. What the fuck is down here, dude? Have you ever seen anything like this before? Mark? Deacon. - Did you hear that? - Mark? Mark? Mark? It's getting tighter. Mark? Dude! What is this? - Look at that! Looks like that was a sacrificial altar. Those cages... Fuck, Deacon. - Dear God. They killed kids. Who could... - Mandeville. The orphanage. - Oh fuck. Dear God. Fuck, Deacon. Mark? Mark, is that you? Mark? It's okay, I can see him! Mark! Deacon! Deacon, wait! Mark! Just wait, I'm coming! It's me! Mark! No, Mark, wait! Mark! Mark? Mark? Where are you? Mark? Deacon! Deacon! - Gray! Hold on, hold on. - Dude, help me! Get me the fuck out of here! - Okay. Help me, Deacon! - Alright, just wait a second. Okay, right! Gray, give me your hand. Give me your hand. Just an inch at a time. That's it, come on. There you go, come on. Come on! One more. Right, come on. I saw Mark, he's just ahead. Mark! - Deacon, wait! Mark. Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Father Calvino. Father Calvino, it's Deacon. We're just coming to get you! Careful, careful. It opens a bit here. Deacon. My prodigal pupil, Deacon. - It's a bit... a bit tight in here. You alright? Gray, are you there? - I'm here, mate. Hang on! You alright? - What is this place? It stinks in here! Just keep close, okay? - Okay. Okay, stop. Stop, Gray! Stop. It's getting too tight in here. We'll have to go back. - I'll turn around, man. Just back up. Back up. Just make your way back down! - It's wet! Quick as you like. - It's wet in here! Deacon, it's blocked this way! - What? It's blocked at this end! Oh God! Okay, okay, okay... - It's moving! Deacon, it's moving! Dude, dig out! Dig, come on! Get away from me! What are we gonna do? Oh God! - I don't know. I don't know! Oh God, it burns! It's burning! Oh God! You said it wasn't real! ...said it wasn't real! Our Father, which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name... Oh God! Oh God!
