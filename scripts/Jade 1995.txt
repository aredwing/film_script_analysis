I think you should canceI your trip to LA. I really do. I will if you'll canceI your triaI. If I do, Mr. Murphy goes to jaiI for 30 years. He deserves it. How could you defend that son of a bitch, anyway? Ever hear of the Sixth Amendment? He's entitled to the best counseI he can buy... I mean get. You got it right the first time, honey. You have to understand something. Mr. Murphy doesn't see himself as a son of a bitch. He gives to charities. He reads bedtime stories to his kids. You're breaking my heart, Matt. Getting slow in your old age, Gavin? Thank you for inviting me. It was Matt's idea. It was? He couldn't believe you never went to a black-and-white ball. I had other priorities. Really? Is everything Matt's idea? You look beautifuI. Thanks. It's past your bedtime, David. I love you, Trina. Telephone call for Mr. Corelli. Mr. Corelli, there's a phone call for you in the lounge. Where's your phone? Corelli. What? How? OK. I'll be right there. David, was it something I said? Kyle Medford's dead. What?! Oh, my God. I just saw him today. You did? Yes. We talked about the new Matisse for the museum. What happened? He was murdered. - It's a freak show. - I'm not here. - Who's in charge? - Hargrove and Vasko. - You on call? - Yep. You just hit the jackpot. Hey. We guess time of death about four hours ago. Want to look upstairs? OK. Get these people out. They're stepping on evidence. Black tie, Mr. Prosecutor? Four separate cuts. Two to the jugular. Take a look at this little goody. Some kind of an African hatchet. It's a fertility mask. The maid says he collected them. He was wearing it when she found him. The maid came back about eight after seeing a movie. She found him like this. The weapon belongs to him. It'll be tough to show premeditation. This is rage. Make sure we get some random blood samples. Let's print the toilet. Maybe he took a leak. Or she. Get anything in here? I got some prints off the tea set. We'll wrap it. It won't be a problem. I'll send the ID tech guy the prints. The lab clear this room? Yeah, they're done. See if we can get a hit this time. Um... That bothers me. See where he is with his work. Karen? Let's get these to the lab. What are they? Well, either he collected pubic hair, or he's auditioning for a ClairoI ad. We're all done. Paramedics are finishing up. - We're heading out. - Right. Don't log this untiI I say, OK? - What is it? - I'll tell you later. Prints on the hatchet. Perfect 14-pointers. Do I get a warrant on phone records? His privacy's gone. The media will make it into a gangbang. Everything goes through me. You gotta be loving this shit. I'm sorry? Next year's an election year. Good to see you. Good to see you, too, Corelli. Better bring Clifford up to speed. - What are you laughing at? - I'm not. Next year is an election year, isn't it? Is it? We'll talk later. Yeah. See you. - David, Mr. Wong. - Mr. Wong. Ask Mr. Wong if he recognises this. It was bought at his store. It's good silver from Chiang-Su in China. Did he do the engraving? No. It was done in Hong Kong. For who? It was made for a rich man here. A gift from a beautifuI woman. Ask him what this means. It means jade. Jade. - Morning, HaI. - Morning, Mr. Gavin. Thank you. Mmm... See you in a couple of days. OK. I'll call you. Be good. Always. You be carefuI. - Morning, Mrs. Gavin. - Morning. Would you care for breakfast? Er... just some coffee. We're ready, Mrs. Gavin. Father, you are holy, indeed, and all Creation rightly gives you praise. AII life, all holiness comes from you, through your son Jesus Christ, our Lord, by the working of the Holy Spirit. From age to age, you gather people to yourself so that from east to west, an offering may be made to the glory of your name. And so, Father, we bring you these gifts. We ask you to make them holy by the power of your spirit, that they may become for us the body and blood of your son our Lord Jesus Christ... What are you doing here? I took Trina to the airport. Free for lunch? You see the papers? It's the case you've been dreaming about. It will put your ambitious ass into the big office. You'll be the next DA of San Francisco. Where did she go? - LA for a few days. - Think she's coming back? Maybe when we get a divorce, you can marry her. CooI. She said you were a terrible lover. She lies to protect your fraiI ego. She said that's why she chose me. Everybody makes mistakes. You finally admit that. - You still playing? - Sure. - See you at 1:00? - Take your best shot. Medford had money problems. Last year he lost $8 million on the yen. That's what he gets for betting the yen. And there's something else. We've got a problem. Only if we make it a problem. We found a roll of film in Medford's safe. - This a gag? - No gag. Those pictures are not relevant to this investigation. Who's the girl? Now, that is a relevant question. Let's find her. We don't know anything about her. It's a waste of time. We know one thing... she's not a nun. What about the, um... gentleman? You want to bring him in? I'm not making that call. I'll take care of it, OK? You've got pictures of the governor with some hooker? Keep that to yourself. - What will you do? - I'm seeing him tomorrow. He could turn you into road-kill. No shit. Why don't you come downtown? As a partner? Eventually. What for? Money. ReaI money. I'm having fun doing what I do. There's only three fun things in life - money, sex and power. Two out of three's not bad. Be carefuI your dream case don't blow your brains out. What's this divorce stuff? Oh, that. I was just yanking your chain. Oh? You guys OK? Yeah. Don't look so disappointed, David. You're a cynicaI son of a bitch, man. Yeah, that's why we're friends. Governor, Mr. Corelli. Morning, sir. David. Good to see you. Always good to see our rising stars, even if they're plotting headaches for my friends. I like your boss. Word is that you were thinking about opposing him. None of us ever run for anything, do we? We just allow the party faithfuI to draft us. You know my AA, Bill Barrett? - Sit down. - Thanks I don't know how I can help with Kyle. I liked him. I've got a meeting in 10 minutes. I was hoping to see you alone. I have no secrets from Bill. He knows where all the bodies are buried. There's something I need to show you. Show me, but quickly. Push the fucking meeting back a half-hour. Yes, sir. I'd like to be alone with David... with the distinguished Mr. Corelli. Where did you get these? Kyle Medford's safe. Son of a bitch. The miserable cock-sucking son of a bitch. Who knows about them? The investigating officers. My people. And you, of course. And me. If you drag me into this, David, if my name even shows up on the periphery of this, you better get the fuck out of California because you'll have as much future as Jerry Brown. Who's Jerry Brown? Wouldn't it be an awfuI shame if one little pussy and a thimblefuI of sperm were to affect the future of this state? Was Medford blackmailing you? I don't get blackmailed, Mr. Corelli. I do the fucking. I never get fucked. I have my answer, then. Thank you for your help. Any time. I enjoy dispensing advice to those who care to listen. Uh, the... You have other copies, I presume? That's correct. Then I'll just hold on to these. Fine. Good to see you again. Dr. Gavin is a psychologist who specialises in the causes and treatment of violence in the workplace. Her work's been published in the NationaI Review of Psychiatry and in her two best-selling works of non-fiction. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Katrina Gavin. Good afternoon. Today I'll examine situations common to your company and others in the changing workplace. It's important to distinguish between someone having a bad day that ends in a tantrum and someone whose failure to resist aggressive impulses results in serious destructive acts. These people are in many ways no different from you and me, but they can no longer controI their urges. They disassociate themselves from their actions, often experiencing an hystericaI blindness. They're blind to the darkness within themselves. You have reached the law offices of Gavin, Terry, and Klorinda. Office hours are 9am to 6pm. After the beep, please leave a message. Hey, it's me. I thought maybe you were working late, but I guess not. I'm so tired of these things, honey. I feel like I'm disassociating myself from my own actions. Maybe I'm reaching hystericaI blindness. Hey, be carefuI. I might give in to an uncontrollable urge. Anyway... I miss you. How does that make you feel? Be nice. You don't give a shit about anyone, do you? That's none of your business. Governor Edwards called me. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Are you out of your fucking mind? The next time you go there, check with me first. OK. I want you off this case. Cliff, I am onto something here. I need a little more time. I want you off the case. You take me off this, and I will go public. I don't think the governor would appreciate that. Why don't you work it out and try it yourself? Maybe I will. You haven't tried a case in 10 years, Cliff. Will there be anything else? Here's the governor's lady friend. She's 17 here. Had to get into juvenile files for this. Patrice Jacinto, 21. Works for a beauty parlour in Chinatown. One arrest for solicitation when she was a juvenile. - You talk to her yet? - No, not yet. Her bank account shows two $10,000 deposits in the last six months. Medford's had this place a couple of years. His investment company leases it. - Hi, John. - Vasko. I bet you can't wait to see the bedroom. - Corelli. - Morning. Deep-seated massage oiI. And over here we have a harmony pillow. "This pillow allows deeper penetration "by positioning both partners most advantageously. "It raises the female hips, facilitating male entry. "You can inflate the pillow "to varying degrees of hardness or softness "while enjoying the thrill of floating action. " Here in the nightstand, we got about three grams of coke... Some poppers, some assorted children's vitamins... My best guess is ecstasy. This is the room the governor was photographed in. Maybe it's his bridaI suite. You look in here? Yeah. It's been photographed. Cristalle, Beluga, Wolfgang Puck... - It's a fuck-house. - Not just a fuck-house. He's got a nice little camera over here... and there's another one up here... low-light, high-density. Neighbour saw a lot of women come here. Did you check out these jammin' jellies and cliterrifics? I was thinking about you. Honey, I'd rip off some of those butt plugs. They're designed for the perfect asshole. Inspector Vasko. Take a look at this. You think the lab can do anything with that? - They can try recycling it. - Great. What about this neighbour? Name's Guy Henderson. Claims he never saw Medford here, but saw women at the house. Can he identify anybody? I think he saw more than he says. His bedroom faces the house and he's got a scope. I didn't spy on them or anything. I'm sure you didn't, Mr. Henderson. A lot of women came up. Men, too. How many different women you see over there? I don't know. Five or six, maybe. Did you ever see any of these women over there? Yeah. Yeah, I, uh... I think I saw her. Patrice Jacinto. She's been working in this beauty parlour for six months. Fifteen jobs in two years. Waitress, actress... You wonder how she put so much dough in her account. Ms. Jacinto? Yes? Could we talk to you? Yeah. Just a second. Ah, shit! Patrice! Watch it! Watch out! Patrice! Stop! Patrice! God damn it! God damn it, hold still! God damn it! Here. Here. Shut up, sweetheart. You're going downtown. - Fuck! - Come on, damn it! My name is David Corelli. I'm the assistant DA in charge of homicide here. Congratulations. Thank you. Something to drink or smoke? No. They said I couldn't smoke in here. They were wrong. Let me tell you how this works. I know, damn it! I'm fucking calling my lawyer! I can't believe you did this shit! Look at this! Look at my face! Sit down, Patrice. Now, sit down. You're right. Call your attorney and say I have a witness who'll identify you visiting Kyle Medford's Pacifica house. Sound familiar? I have pictures of you fucking the governor and those pictures will ruin the governor's career. And you know what's going to happen then, Patrice? Your attorney will tell you to go fuck yourself and hang up. The pay phone is right out there in the hall. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I met Kyle at a party and he knew I was broke, so he offered me 500 a pop. I mean, I fuck guys for less. I'd go to the Pacifica house, a guy would come and we'd spend the night. They wouldn't know me. I didn't know them. A couple of creeps didn't even want me. They wanted this other girl they'd fucked before. They called her Jade. One of those guys was the governor. Jade must have rocked his world, because he wanted me to bend over and turn around, but I don't take it that way. He told me that Jade took it any way. She couldn't get enough. She loved it. I saw her once leaving Kyle's house. She had long, beautifuI hair and great legs. I think it was her. I never met her. I'd like to, though. I'm into women, mostly. Uhh! Somebody sawed through your brake line. There was no fluid in your wheeI cylinders. His blood count's low. He's lost consciousness, could have a concussion. We'll have to run some tests. Somebody up there loves you, Corelli. They want to subpoena my records. They talked to my CEO. He's pleading to two felony counts and telling everything. - What does he know? - Everything. You know Vince. He's my closest friend - 20 years. Who's representing him? Lawton. - Harry Lawton? - Yeah. Has he signed a plea agreement? I don't know. I know Harry. Don't worry about it. What do you mean? He's a bullshit artist. If it wasn't for me, he would have been disbarred. What am I going to do, Matt? I've got four kids. - A triaI will kill Sara. - You will not go to triaI. You will not do one day in jaiI. You have my word. Listen to me. When they find out I'm representing you, this will all go away - everything, OK? We got prints on the hatchet. Patrice? No, but we got lucky. An arrest in Palo Alto in 1980. Some animaI rights protest at Stanford. No charges ever filed, but the Sacramento computer held prints. Anna Katrina Maxwell. We're trying to locate her through the admissions office. - You OK? - Yeah. I'm fine. Nice work. I appreciate you doing this, Mr. Henderson. I want to show you one more set of pictures. OK. Anybody look familiar? None of these are familiar. Nobody from that set. OK. One more group. One, two... One more. Yeah. I've seen her. - The one in the middle? - Yeah. OK. Paisan, get in here. It's about time. Tell Judge Licaldi I'll ring him later. Come on. She told you she saw Medford that day. They were looking at a Matisse. Matt, her prints are on the hatchet. I got to start at the beginning. She probably looked at his collection while she was there. What are you saying? To eliminate her, I need to speak to her. Fine. She'll be back from LA tomorrow. - Talk to her. - Officially. Come on, David... You know her. You know her as well as I do. You loved her. - Still do. - Cheap shot. You think she'd take a fucking hatchet to somebody? No, I don't, which is why I need to talk to her. Fine. Come to the house, have lunch, then talk to her. Yes? Can I help you? Inspector Vasko, San Francisco Police Department. - In the living room, please. - Thank you. - Hi, Maria. - Mr. Corelli. Nice to see you. Cosy little pad. Yeah. Kind of like Candlestick Park. Sorry to keep you waiting. Hello. - Inspector Vasko. - Trina Gavin. - Hi, Bob Hargrove. - Hi. - Matt said you had an accident. - I'm fine. Let's get something straight. Mrs. Gavin is only talking to you because she is not a suspect. The investigation does not focus on her at this time. I think we can live with that. What's your relationship with Kyle Medford? I'm on the board of the Pacific Museum. Kyle was chairman. He felt we were too conservative in our acquisitions program. I supported his efforts to be more active. Did you see him socially? No, not really. My husband and I saw him at various functions. Did you ever meet alone? Yes. One time. The day he died. He called me to talk about acquiring a new Matisse. I was leaving town, so I agreed to meet him at his house. That was last Saturday? Yes. What time did you get there? I got there around 4:00. We talked about the Matisse. He gave me some tea. He showed me his collection. Was he alone? Yes. Did anyone see you there? No. I don't think so. What sort of things did he show you? He showed me this God-awfuI mask from the Cameroon - I think it was a fertility mask - and a hatchet. He said it was over 100 years old. Did you touch anything? I touched the hatchet. The mask, he held it up. I can't remember whether I touched it or not. What did you do after you left? I went home. Was your husband here? - No. - Was anyone here? Staff? - No. - Did you use the phone? I had the machine on. I was preparing a speech. Look, I have no alibi untiI 9:00, when we went to the ball. - Is that what you're asking? - What else do you need? Have you ever been to Medford's beach house? Only his house in the city. I didn't know he had another. Ever give Medford a silver jewellery box? I never gave any gift. You never had sex with him? What kind of question is that? That's why they're here. You don't have to answer that. I said I had no sociaI contact with him. I do consider sex to be a sociaI contact, David. As you know, I'm married. I think she did it. Why? No alibi. Prints on the hatchet. - And she lied. - TypicaI shrink. They pull your strings. She was pulling your strings pretty good. The guy almost had them convinced... Morning, Corelli. Hey, Dave, how you doing? Got something to show you. How we doing? Now this... is what you gave us. We were able to enhance it using software algorithms. Let's see... This is how it looked when we got it. Medford's beach house. At least it's not the governor again. Or the president. Thank God. I can still believe in hope. There's some jump cuts, but we saved a few minutes. You ever take it like that, Corelli? Is that an offer, Inspector? You wish. We cleaned it up a lot more from here on. Right. Keep working on this, you'll have a PG rating. Boy, it's a wonderfuI country, isn't it? Freeze it right there. Magnify it. Jesus. David? Got a minute? Yeah. Miss Jacinto called. She wants to meet you at 5:00 today. Tell her Fior d'Italia, Washington Square. OK. She said it's about Jade. Hey, you asshole! Get away from her! Call an ambulance. Call 911. Code three. Do it! Hey, you asshole! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Man, you fucked up! MedicaI examiner's case number 3209. March 16, 1995. Patrice Jacinto. There are abrasions to the chin. The abrasions are minimally haemorrhagic and red to purple in colour. The neck wound is of a "Y" configuration - the horizontaI line being five inches long and half an inch in width. We don't have a talking head any more. Somebody knew she was talking to us. I didn't know you knew the governor. I don't. I know Bill Barrett. Why? - Want me to introduce you? - Go fuck yourself. - Glad you made her talk? - What did you say? You heard it. What? I am onto you! I am onto you! Get off me, Petey! I am onto you. You want to tell me about that? I can't yet. What is it? - It's a cuff link. - Don't play with me. I want to know what it means. I don't know. What if this comes up in triaI, David? There'll be questions asked... I would never put you up for grabs. You are taking a huge chance here. - So are you. - Yeah. No shit. There was something between you and Mrs. Gavin... A long time ago. And you're OK with that now? I hope so. People who commit these acts are no different from you and me, but they can no longer controI their urges. They disassociate themselves from their actions, often experiencing an hystericaI blindness. They're blind to the darkness within themselves. This is from a speech she made in LA just a week ago. We have her prints on the hatchet. We have her Iying to us in her statement. She was in Medford's house just before he was killed. - She's got no alibi. - We don't have a motive. What about blackmaiI? The murder weapon wasn't hers. No premeditation. Matt Gavin's wife - he'll eat us for breakfast. It was her. She did it. What make of car killed Patrice? Black Thunderbird. You didn't ID the plates? No. No plates. What does Mrs. Gavin drive? Uh, they've got three cars. A Jag, a Range Rover... And a black Thunderbird, right? All right, bring her in. Just who I wanted to see. Those photographs you left in Sacramento, I thought maybe now that you won't need them, you could help me find the negatives. Why don't you help him, Pat? - Yeah, right. - Excuse me. Are you putting me on? What do you need them for? They're not relevant any more. Beat it. Aren't you going to read me my rights? You can leave any time. I've told you about Kyle. What else is there? This is about Jade. A couple of creeps didn't even want me. They wanted this girl they'd fucked before. They called her Jade. One of those guys was the governor. Jade must have rocked his world. He wanted me to bend over and turn around, but I don't take it that way. He said Jade took it any way. She couldn't get enough of it. ' What does this have to do with Katrina? Could I have that other tape, please? Mrs. Gavin, is that you? That's not her! - Mrs. Gavin? - You don't have to answer. I'm sorry, Matt. Fuck you, David! All right, let's get on with it. I met Jim at the museum. I'd never cheated on my husband before. He took me to a house. I spent the night with him. Where? Pacifica. Some place on the beach. Did you have sex with other men? No. I cheated on my husband. I didn't know I'd be arrested. You're not under arrest. You never called yourself Jade or used Medford's house? Look, bring that girl in here. She'll tell you I'm not that person. The girl is dead. Excuse me. Would it surprise you to know that Medford owned the Pacifica house? Yes, it would. What if a witness saw you severaI times? I'd say your witness was mistaken. Would you? Where were you yesterday between five and six pm? In the city. I met Matt for a drink around 5:00. Then I went to my office. I returned a few calls and I got home around 7:45. - What about Medford? - What were you driving? - I asked a question. - I'll do the questions. - What were you driving? - My car. - Black Thunderbird? - Yes. Anything else? Can you be in a line-up tomorrow? That's enough! If you're charging her, do it right now! Well, I think she had an uncontrollable urge, coupled with hystericaI blindness. It's time you took yourself out of this. I don't understand something. How could you do this to me? How could I do this to you? - What did you expect? - Expect? I didn't expect to go downtown and sit and watch a tape of my wife fucking somebody! You think I don't know about you? Know what? I know everything. I know their names. I know about the Fairmont Towers, sometimes your office. I'm not stupid, Matt. Is that why you did it? We'll check if that's blood on the tyres. You'll get a comparison with Patrice's? Yeah, right. What about this? This looks like blood. Could be paint transfer from an impact. This is the car, Petey. This car was reported stolen about a week ago. Belongs to some computer company executive. Not Mrs. Gavin's car. Maybe somebody wants us to think it was. This is the car, Petey. This is the car. What, did the tape turn you on? Don't ever talk to me like that again! Do you understand me? What are you doing here? I need to talk to you. I can't. You know that. I need your help, David. I'm afraid. Afraid of what? Who am I speaking to? Can I come in? Come on in. I didn't know Kyle was taping any of it. I knew they were powerfuI, but I had no idea he was using them. He told me they were friends of his. How many were there? A lot. I don't know. I lost track. How could you let them do that? They didn't do anything. It was my choice. I liked it. - And Matt? - I don't fuck him that way. That's not what I mean. What did you tell him? Nothing. He only knows about the man on the tape. Who were the others? Men with money... reputations. I didn't have to fall in love with them, David. It was safe. At least, I thought it was. David, I know too much. One of them killed Kyle and Patrice. - I could be next. - You should go. I know too much! I know you love me. Don't do this. Don't do this. Nothing's changed. Everything's changed. What? You killed Medford. Where are you going? San Francisco DA. All right. No. There's our last link to Jade. Anyone who's ever seen her is dead or suffering from penile amnesia. Jade doesn't exist any more. CarefuI. You nearly stood on the murder weapon. He was obviously killed with that. There doesn't appear to be forced entry. His brother came for dinner, found the body... The brother has a key. He's still warm. He's only been dead an hour. - How long? - An hour. - Where's the phone? - It's right up there. Your friend Trina sure gets around. She couldn't have done this. - Why not? - She was with me. Maria! Maria, it's Mr. Corelli. Yes. Is Mrs. Gavin home? No. OK. How about Mr. Gavin? OK, would you tell Mr. Gavin that I will be at my apartment? Right. Thanks. Maria. Where are you going? A clouded dream on an earthly night Hangs upon the crescent moon A voiceless song in an ageless light Sings at the coming dawn Birds in flight are calling there Where the clouds move the storms It's there that my heart is longing for All for the love of you... Stop! Stop! Stop! So it's there my homage's due Clutched by the still of the night Now I feel, feel you move And every breath, breath is full So it's there my homage's due Hello? Hello? Hell... You fucked her, didn't you? Matt, where is she? - Huh? - Matt, she's in trouble. Maria? Maria, are you in your room? Anybody here? Matt? Matt? Uh! Oh! This is Katrina Gavin, 1100 Hillsborough. No. Hillsborough. Talking to one of your boyfriends? David, watch it! Trina. Trina! You like it like this, don't you? Let her go! Who's there? It's a tragedy for justice when law enforcement people go bad. They were cleaning up your shit. They were just two loyaI supporters... Two supporters who got carried away. They wanted to see if she had more pictures of the governor. They acted on their own out of misguided loyalty. Kyle Medford was shaking you down and was killed for it. Patrice was in those pictures. She was next, then Henderson, who could ID everybody. That left Trina Gavin. Why are you wasting the governor's time? Anything happens to Trina Gavin, I have film of you and a dead hooker. And what if something happens to you? Leave her alone. Get the fuck out of here. Ready, darling? We're going to be late. Where did you get these? Kyle Medford showed me the day before I killed him. You knew, and you killed him? He was a scumbag. He would have taken us both down. I told you... I will never let anyone hurt you. But I don't remember any of it. You know what I think it is? HystericaI blindness. Do me a favour, Trina. Next time we make love, you introduce me to Jade. A clouded dream on an earthly night Hangs upon the crescent moon A voiceless song in an ageless light Sings at the coming dawn Birds in flight are calling there Where the heart moves the stones It's there that my heart is longing for All for the love of you A painting hangs on an ivy wall Nestled in the emerald moss Eyes declare a truce of trust Then it draws me far away Where deep in the desert twilight Sand melts in pools of the sky Darkness lays her crimson cloak Your lamps will call, call me home So it's there my homage's due Clutched by the still of the night Now I feel, feel you move And every breath, breath is full So it's there my homage's due Clutched by the still of the night Even the distance feels so near All for, for the love of you A clouded dream on an earthly night Hangs upon the crescent moon A voiceless song in an ageless light Sings at the coming dawn Birds in flight are calling there Where the heart moves the stones It's there that my heart is longing for All for, for the love of you
