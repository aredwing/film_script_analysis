I hope this repays him a little, at least. I'm going to miss working for him. If it would make it simpler for you, christabel doesn't have to come tomorrow - maybe later in the week. Her uncle says her business school starts monday. I don't know why my brother insists upon christabel going to business school... if she's going to work in his office, it seems so unnecessary. If she eventually gets my job, it will be helpful. Excuse me. Yes. Kenneth, miss foster. Come on up, kenneth, and leave the door open, will you, please? I wish we had time to sit down and have a nice talk, miss caine. Well, it's so late, and you have so much to do. You've been most kind, and i'm sure christabel will be very happy here. I do wish i could keep her with me, but there aren't many opportunities in santa flora for an attractive young girl, and christabel is so-so alive. Don't miss her already. Would you put all that in the kitchen, please? Yes, miss foster. I'm so sorry i'm rushed like this, but the one day i decide to give a party... everything has to happen at the office. Gobby? Naturally. Well, come on up, and leave the door open. Naturally. Oh! Ha ha ha! I'll go now. Please wait. I'll walk down with you. Hello. Hello, margaret. Don't bother. I'll be all right. But l-no, margaret! The party's after the play. Good-bye. Well, you can come back with us in curtis' car. Yes. Hello. Good evening. Gobby, put those things in the kitchen. Who was the gypsy? Yes. Yes. Who are you talking to? Margaret. Margaret? Let me say hello to margaret. Gobby wants to say hello to you. Hello, margaret. Hello, gobby. Oh, gobby. Thank you very much. Gobby, there are a million things we have to do. We? Who is the hired help you were just talking to? They work for curtis. They brought some things over. Instead of moving his house over here, why don't you wait until you're mrs. Curtis carey? Then think up the party, and somebody else can do the work and pay the bills. How much do i owe you? $14.71, including old age pension, unemployment insurance, and withholding tax. Oh, gobby- you want this stuff in the icebox? Please. I forgot soda. Order it for me, will you, gobby? Clicquot or bicarbonate? Whose picture did you bring this time? That's the one i did for mrs. Herkimer. They are going to be here tonight, aren't they? Why do you keep using my apartment for your gallery? Why don't you use your own place, or better yet- no temper, please. Be careful what you say. Remember, i'm only helping you because you're going to be rich. Hello. I want some soda water. Hello. I'm christabel caine. But you're not coming until tomorrow. I'm not? I mean, you're not expected until tomorrow. But aunt clara couldn't have- she couldn't have made such a mistake. When uncle john came up to santa flora, he talked about a party or something, and i understood from aunt clara i was to come the day after. The party was last night, so- but the party is tonight. Oh. Your aunt clara was just here. Oh, i didn't realize. It must have been- oh, i'm so sorry. Think i ought to put a price tag on it, or would that be too obvious? Christabel, this is gabriel broome. This is christabel- john caine's niece. How would you like to have your portrait painted? You want to paint me? I'll paint anyone with a rich uncle. Was that the only piece of luggage you brought? Oh, i'm not staying tonight. I wouldn't dream of staying. I'll find a room in a hotel somewhere. Please don't worry about me. I'll be all right. Where do you want these? Well, i guess you just better take them down again. If you'll just put them in here, please. Whoever you are, come on up. The room looks beautiful, donna. Thanks, gobby. And you're beautiful. And john caine's niece will be beautiful, too, won't you? Sure you will. See you at the theater. Hello, curtis. Hello, gobby. You'll find your bride-to-be sticking toothpicks in the shrimps. They're dead, though. Donna! Well, both domestic and beautiful. What a combination. You're too early. I thought i could help you. You're too late. All right, the truth, then- i couldn't stay away another minute. Donna, you'll never know how long a day can be without you. I like you. You know, i believe you mean it. You can keep right on believing. Donna, you're not ready yet. I thought i'd go just as i am. This is the man i'm marrying for his money. Curtis carey, christabel caine - john's niece. Why, hello. All those nice things your uncle john has been telling me about you are obviously true. Thank you. It's so sweet of you to take both of us tonight. Delighted. I'll get ready. What does she mean, take both of you? Did you get an extra ticket? You can get one, darling. Call somebody. I've never been to an opening. Oh? Curtis. Yes. It's opening night. Is it hard to get tickets? Oh, no, it's no trouble at all. Joe bishop, please. Call joe bishop, curtis! Well, do you know where i can reach him? Curtis, call joe bishop! This is curtis carey calling. I need another ticket for the londer opening tonight. Not even in the balcony? Well, there must be something. Tell him to leave it at the box office, dear. All right. Yeah, yeah, i know you would. Thanks very much. Bye. Christabel, you'll need a wrap. I couldn't get another ticket. Why didn't you call joe bishop, dear? I did call joe bishop. What are we going to do? Why don't you two go? That's silly. Why don't you take christabel? Well, now, wait a minute. I could stay here. I don't think i made enough hors d'oeuvres, anyway. Now, i wouldn't hear of it. Well, let's all stay home. Curtis. Isn't there someone you can phone? Yes-joe bishop. Here, let me help you. There. That softens your face so much. Isn't she beautiful? Very. Come on, we have to go. It's getting late. I feel simply dreadful about this. I don't want to hear another word. See you later. Have a wonderful time. Hello. Yes? Oh, aunt clara, i've been trying to reach you, but your line's been busy. You don't know how worried i've been waiting for you to answer. Christabel, i've been frantic. I've called all over town for you. Where are you? I'm at donna's. I know how you must have felt when you got home, and- just a minute, aunt clara. Somebody's just- hello. Hello? Hello! Christabel, is everything all right? I talked to donna, and l- oh, yes, dear, i'm having a wonderful time. Get off the phone! Hello? Hello. What are you doing here? Eating. What are you doing here? I live here. Oh, no. Try again. Who are you? Janitor. How dare you interrupt my telephone call. Careful or i'll shut off the water. Who are you? I'm christabel caine. Ok, chris, where's the salt? I don't know. You'd know if you lived here. Does miss foster know you do this? I think you'd better get out of here. Now, where's the pepper? I don't know. You don't know very much, do you? Well, you don't have to. 'Cause you're awful pretty. I'll start things in the kitchen. Here, you hide in here, and i'll fix it so you can crash the party later. Donna! Donna, there's a monster in your kitchen! What? She always keeps her monsters on ice. Hi, nick. Where do you hide the mustard? Hiya, curtis. Hello, nick. I was afraid you wouldn't get here. Been wondering the same thing about you. Do you know this woman? I'm sorry, nick. This is- i know. We've been rassling. Give me another. I left a manuscript here for you to read, remember? It's good... except in places, i think it's still too brutal. That's funny. I copied whole passages right out of little women, just for people like you. I know the stories you've told me about china. Stop acting as if china was a garden party. I've always wanted to know somebody who's been to china. Tell me about it. A lot of chinese live there. She's real pretty. At least i'm well-mannered. Thanks, curtis. Who is he? The monster? Nick bradley. Friend of yours? Well, donna knew him first. She discovered him. He's an author. Oh, her protege? Oh, i didn't mean that. Ha ha! I know you didn't. Let me take that. All those people... all right. Hello, senator. Good evening, curtis. All those people are very anxious to meet you. I'll make it as painless as possible. This is your house? Yes. Big, isn't it? Donna should be very happy here. You know, they used to say about me that my slip was showing- my bank deposit slip. Oh, that's because they know all the wonderful things you're doing- charities, foundations, everything. Uncle john's told me all about you. There's still an awful lot of people without money who expect me to apologize for having it. Ha ha! Well, don't you do it. Don't worry. I never do. You're very wise. You know, i think i'm going to like you. Come on, let's go. Hello, gobby. Tried to find you during intermission. I was being trampled on. What's on your mind? I want you to invest in something terrific. I told you you'd be beautiful. Thank you, sir. Invest in what? In me, of course. I want to have a one-man show late this summer- august maybe. It will cost about $500, but what's money? Mine or yours? Yours, of course. I have none. Well, don't be so smug about it. Where are the herkimers? My palm is itching. Hello, uncle john. Why, hello. Hello, john. This niece of yours turns out to be a very surprising young lady. Quite surprising. I'll be right back. I thought we decided that you weren't coming until tomorrow. I wanted to come to the party. Besides, it was much better for aunt clara. Did you know she took a trip down here today to arrange things for you? I knew she came to see the doctors. Did you call her and let her know? I did it the first thing, uncle john. Good. John, this is nick bradley. Hello, mr. Caine. I've been looking forward to seeing you. Have you read it yet? Not yet, but if donna says it's a good book, i'll certainly read it. Put it on my desk monday, will you? You can take it home with you tonight. She's a tough critic. Had me rewriting for months. I hated her. Do you go around hating everybody? Do you two know each other? Oh, yes. We're old friends. Had a lot of laughs together, haven't we? Mr. Caine, i'd like you to see a portrait i just painted. I did mrs. Herkimer. They're supposed to be here. I heard the herkimers were getting a divorce. She left him, anyway. Oh, no. Now i'm stuck with mrs. Herkimer. You don't know who she left him for, do you? Ha ha ha! Here we are. You look even better awake than sleeping. Hmm? You were asleep when i first came in. Very appealing. Donna tells me you're going to the business school. When you go to school, i'm going to carry your books for you. What kind of books are they? I'm going to be a file clerk. At least, that's what i'm going to start out as after donna and curtis are married. A file clerk? You? It's not always easy working for a relative. They sometimes bend over backwards not to show favoritism. Not planning to take donna's place, are you? Oh, yes. Have you seen the view? Yes. It looks better with me in it. Curtis. Yes. You promised to introduce me. Right away. If she played her cards right... she could win me. Smells good. What is it? Beef stroganoff - specialty of the house. You could have had it sooner. I didn't miss it. How do you know? You haven't tasted it yet. How come donna broke down and let you visit a strange man's apartment? Oh, she didn't make me turn you down the other times you called. It was just that- well, i was so busy with school and having my portrait painted. Tagging around with donna and curtis. Can you think of any better company? Me. Oh. Ha ha! How's your shorthand? Oh, it's terrible. I've given it up. How come? Well, i don't think i can ever replace donna in the office. No, i don't suppose you can. Why not? Now, look, it was your idea, not mine. Now, sing for your supper. Tell me the story of your life. Well, it's not very wonderful. Just a girl who lost her parents and went to live with her poor aunt. Of course, i could have gone to live with uncle john. He's the rich member of the family, but aunt clara needed me. It was worth the sacrifice just to bring her a little happiness. Go on. That's all. Ok, i'll get the rest later. Well, i told you, though, there isn't any more. I know you did, but that isn't going to stop me. I want to know what's going on in that pretty little head- in both those heads. What does that mean? I think there are two of you. One is fictional- a little gal who sees herself getting all the things she never had- and the other one is real, and i like her a lot. Ha ha! Now you sound like an author. I am an author and a darn good one. You want to stay away from me, don't you, chris? At least one of you does. Why is that? What's the reason, chris? Is it this? You want to know something? You're like me... both of you. Stop turning your head and hold still. Are you this disagreeable to all the women you paint? Yes, if they persist in talking. You don't care much for women, do you? My dear girl, apart from painting, my major occupation is convincing husbands that i'm harmless. Now can we get to work? You would like to have this shown, wouldn't you? Of course i would. I've even sacrificed business school for you. Immediately after flunking out. That's not true. Relax. This is gobby. I suppose you're walking out on me again this afternoon with nick. Mm-hmm. We're going to the beach. You're wasting my time, christabel. Nick will never be rich enough to buy this. I told you uncle john would buy it. And uncle john told me that if i kept you away from business school another day, he'd report me to the truant officer. He doesn't know about your quitting, does he? I haven't had the opportunity to tell him. Hello. Who? Yes, she's here. It's for you. I can't see why you don't take your calls at home. Hello. Of course i'll talk to mr. Carey. Hello. Hello, curtis. Are you really calling me? Why, of course i'll help you. Is anything wrong? Any time at all. I'll be there... and... thank you for calling me. Bye. You turned your head again... or has curtis turned it? Really, gobby. I can't imagine why i put up with you. Because i know too much about you. As a result, you can be yourself with me. The way you treat your friends. I have no friends, only creditors. I suppose we'll have to let him in before he breaks the door down. You rang? Hi, whistler. Hello, mother. What are you hiding, gobby? Now, isn't this enough art for one exhibit? Look, nick, i've got 3 more hours of light. Give me a break, will you? Every time i take chris out, i do you a favor. Artists have to suffer, you know? You ready? I can't go with you today. You got a good reason? Well, i promised gobby i'd stay. Hmm. "Hmm" what? Just "hmm." What's wrong with it? Don't ask him. Looks like a cross between lucrezia borgia and peg o' my heart. Even with two heads, you couldn't look like this... or do you know something i don't? Never heard of anything so ridiculous. Why don't you go back to china and write another book about it? Right now, i mean. I like it here. In that case, i suggest that you stick to your typewriter, and i'll stick to my palette. And chisel? Well, i think it's wonderful. Well, that settles it. Come on outside. I want to talk to you. Now, look- i never suspected you knew so much about everything. It's most enlightening. Where do you get dialogue like that? Not from anything you wrote. Oh, you read my book. Mm-hmm. Come on. You didn't like it. I hated every word of it. Why? Well, i... the norwegian sailor confuse you? Yes. I thought he was a brutal character. Especially when he murdered the girl. Yes. I like to think of people as human beings. Christabel, if you ever draw an honest breath, i want to be there to see it. I've never seen anybody choke to death. You can't make me lose my temper. I don't think i want to see you again. Christabel. Yes? Come here. What do you want? You'll find out when you get here. Well? If we're going to say good-bye forever, we might as well do it right. Bye. Good-bye. Dinner's at 7:00. We just said good-bye. You didn't mean that. You're incurable. Your place? My place. Want me to pick you up? I'll be there. All right. Christabel. There's no norwegian sailor in my book. Don't go around telling people there is. Now can we get to work? What are you doing? See you tomorrow, darling. Christabel! It's very handsome, but that's not quite it. Hello, curtis. Am i late? No. Almost perfect timing. How are you at picking out engagement presents? No experience, sir, but i'm glad you thought of me. It has to be something just as special as donna is. That makes it difficult. When you called me, i thought you were in trouble. I was. I'd already been to 3 different shops. I was worried about you. Oh, look. Oh, that is something. You think she'd like it? Oh, no. It just happened to catch my eye. It's one of our finest pieces. Yes, i'm sure it is. Let's look over here. It's lovely. Well, what about a wristwatch? Mmm. No. I don't think so, do you? They're rather showy. They're all matched stones, sir. It's beautiful. Mmm. These are not only matched stones, but notice the sapphires. Oh, curtis, come here. Did you find something? Look at these darling cameos- so old-fashioned, so like donna. Those are not real cameos, madam. They're costume jewelry- what they call costume jewelry. Could i see that one, please? Ahem. Certainly. Isn't it sweet? Well, l-i... don't you love it? Well, l- oh, it's exactly what i would want, but then i suppose no two people have the same taste. No. Oh, christabel, this necklace really is beautiful. Oh, that. Don't you like it? Oh, of course i do, but isn't it awfully expensive? Not for what it is, madam. Donna wouldn't think of the expense. It's just a question of whether she'd like it or not. Curtis, you make her sound so mercenary. She'd never accept that. Oh, this is so sweet. Excuse me, madam, but there really is no comparison. No, i suppose there isn't. Oh, i'm sure donna would love this. Well, you know her better than i do. If you think that would make her happy... oh, i'm sure it would. I do, indeed. I'll take that. Now, why don't you let me give you the cameo for helping me out? Well, i wouldn't dream of it. You've been much too extravagant already. Thank you for your trouble. Good evening, miss foster. Hello, arthur. Mr. Carey's on the terrace. Thank you. Hello, darling. Hello, curtis. Tired? Exhausted. Oh, never to have to work again. Christabel's been with me all afternoon. I asked her to stay and have dinner. Oh, how thrilling. We're outside. You were so late i had curtis telephone you at the office. It was a madhouse there. I escaped and went home to change. What were you and curtis doing? Is it a secret? Tell her. Don't make her wait. Well, i had thought later- we've made such a mystery of it already. Thank you. For you. Curtis. It's an engagement present. Happy engagement. You like it? Like it? Oh, curtis. Sapphires. Any time you two want another secret, go right ahead. Isn't it the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? Yes, quite beautiful. Darling. See? You were wrong. She did accept it. Curtis, you're supposed to hook this. You do know her better than i do. What are you two whispering about? Nothing. Christabel just thought you might not like it. Not like it? Why shouldn't i? Well, of course you should, donna. It's the finest piece they had. Salesman said so. She thought you'd rather have something more simple. I'm glad i was wrong. I picked out the sweetest little cameo, but curtis wouldn't hear of it, would you? Well, i was sure you'd rather have the sapphires. Because they cost more? Well, you know that had nothing to do with it. Dinner is served, sir. Thank you, arthur. Would you help me? Oh, please don't take it off. It looks lovely on you. Doesn't it, curtis? If you like, i'll exchange it in the morning. No, curtis. Didn't somebody say something about dinner? Nick bradley is here, john. You tell him. You handle these things better than i do. Besides, i've got to go. You look tired. You work me too hard. Nonsense. It takes your mind off your wedding. Send nick bradley in, please. Really, john, he'd rather hear it from you. Hello, mr. Caine. Hello. Have you read any good books lately? Ha! Nick, i've got to go and keep an author from talking to the press. You're a good writer, nick, with a genuine gift for words. Our eastern office agrees with me, and they've accepted the book. Of course, it needs cutting, and i want you to work on it with one of our editors when he gets back from boston. Yes? Mr. Caine's car is here. All right. You take over from here, donna. Thank you very much, mr. Caine. Nonsense. I hope it makes a lot of money... for both of us. What do you know? You sold a book. That's what you've been telling me all the time. Celebration. No. Come on. You call curtis, and we'll have a great big celebration. No, nick. I can't. Look, i'm happy, and i have a habit of wanting the people i like to be happy. Anything wrong? No. Nothing. Not at all. Correction-yes. Here. I've got a nice, dry shoulder. You cry on it. Nick, if you were very wealthy, would you know if someone was marrying you for your money or for you? If i were curtis, i wouldn't have any doubts about you. You don't miss much, do you, nick? In my pursuit of truth and the elusive christabel, i've seen an awful lot of you and curtis. It doesn't take much savvy to know that things aren't the way they were. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe. Maybe you're not fighting curtis' doubts. You can't fight doubts, nick. At least i can't. Either curtis has faith in me, or he hasn't. The old pride, eh? Come on. I'll buy you a drink, and we'll drown it. I can't. I have to meet curtis. Why don't you come with me? Where to? The osbourne gallery. Gobby's one-man show. Oh, yes. I promised gobby faithfully that i wouldn't be there. Let's go. Thanks for the shoulder, nick. Use it any time. Personally, i think curtis is the all-time all-american sap. You know, john is right. You have a gift for words, but you do need cutting. Come on. Yes, ma'am. Peasant. Who was it? It says, "gabriel broome." Oh. So is this. All of them are. Is he living or dead? Dead, of course. Living. Ida mae, look. That's the girl in the portrait. Hi. Maybe he is alive. Hello, gobby. Is this your dull, blue period? How's it going? People are just beginning to arrive. Have you sold me yet, gobby? No. The olsons were here, but they still think you're too expensive. Something is missing. Where's donna? She's still at the office, i suppose. Oh. The olsons are back. Excuse me, will you? Gobby knows too much or thinks he does. It's just because you're upset about donna. It makes you oversensitive, and you shouldn't be, curtis. Donna loves you. I'm sure she does. I wish i were sure. Most men have to go out and make their successes. I didn't. All my life, i've had to prove one thing- that people wanted me and not my money. You don't have to prove it to me, curtis. I know that. I didn't think i had to prove it to donna, either. Now l-i don't know anymore. If two people are really in love, they should accept one another with trust and understanding. That's a big if. Isn't there some way you can find out how donna feels, just to satisfy your own foolish doubts? If i let donna suspect i have any doubts, i'll lose her altogether. But she needn't suspect. I know very little about these things, but isn't there some arrangement, the sort that lawyers work out between a husband and wife? I don't think i understand what you mean. I'm not very sure that i understand, either, but when two people marry, isn't there something about rights and things? Dear, i'm getting all mixed up. You aren't suggesting that i ask donna to give up any rights to my estate? Curtis, that's a wonderful idea. But it's your idea, not mine. I wouldn't dream of such a thing. Of course not, not really, but i just meant as a sort of a test. No. That's out of the question. But, curtis, you're not being fair to donna. At least you ought to give her the chance to prove that she loves you. That's what i would want you to do if i were donna. The olsons have decided they want something that looks more like an ancestor. I guess i'll have to do a self-portrait. I'm glad you didn't sell it. It would be just like living in a stranger's house. I have to eat, christabel, and what's more, i like eating. Then go right ahead and sell it. Gobby, before you sell it, check with me, will you? Oh, there's donna. Where? Oh, excuse me. Please be nice to her, curtis. Isn't that terrific, donna? Look at the skin texture on that girl. And just the suggestion of the men watching this beautiful creature as she stands poised on the threshold of life. Look at those eyes. Have you ever seen such depth? That picture happens to be called hungry man digging potatoes. My error. Hello, gobby. Hiya. I'll thank you to stop scaring away the customers. We're all down in front of christabel's picture. All kneeling? Hungry man eating potatoes? Digging. Oh, digging. Donna, i thought you'd never get here. Nick. Hiya. Hi, nick. Hello, darling. Lucrezia borgia or peg o' my heart? Don't start that again. Have you sold it yet? I'm not quite sure. Now that it's finished, you'll have to dream up another excuse for breaking dates. Just for that, you can take me to dinner. You've made yourself a date. What's the quickest way out of here? The window. I wonder if nick is the right kind of man for christabel. Do you feel responsible for her, curtis? Yes, in a way. Don't you? You know, she was so unhappy- like a kid- when she thought of some stranger owning her portrait. Let's give it to her. It's your money. Do you always have to talk about money? It seems to be very much on your mind these days. If it's going to upset you, i won't give her the portrait. The portrait has nothing to do with what we're talking about. I simply thought it would be a nice thing to do. After all, christabel has so little. I wouldn't worry too much about christabel. She'll get more. Donna, has christabel done anything to you? I wish i knew. I happen to know that she's extremely fond of you. Only a few moments ago, she told me how wonderful you were, how much you loved me. Do you need her reassurance? Why, of course not. Donna. I'm sorry if it hit home. This isn't like you. It's not like either one of us. Donna, not so loud. Things are getting worse all the time. It's as though you no longer trusted me. I wonder if we can ever get back to where we were. I don't know. There might be a way. How, curtis? I think that lecherous old man ogling christabel's portrait is going to buy it. Excuse me, donna. Aquarius... jupiter... mars... venus... stop there. Please, nick. It's getting late. I ought to go in. Not yet. I don't want to lose you. You won't lose me. Well, not when we're alone like this, but when we're with other people- donna and curtis, gobby- you're gone. It's just your imagination. Well, i admit it's vivid, but it's very accurate. Why don't you marry me and quit getting lost? Nick, please. That's no answer. I can't, darling. I need time. Give me a little time. Time for what? Just a little longer. All right. I won't push you. I'll give you till tomorrow night. My place at 7:00. I can't. I have to go to the ball, the carey charity ball. Did anyone ever tell you that charity begins at home? All right. The next night. Good night, nick. How many times do i have to tell you how much you love me? What are you doing, donna? Packing. Where are you going? London. With curtis? I'm glad everything is all right. Did you think anything was wrong? Of course not, silly. I just didn't know you were planning quite so soon. When? Tomorrow afternoon. But the ball. I won't be at the ball. But curtis has to be there. He- i said i won't be there. Donna, how terrible. Yes, isn't it? Terrible for everybody but you. I don't understand. What do you mean? You almost stumbled, as i did once. When you came here that first day, i fell flat on my face over your suitcase. I never really got up. But surely you're not blaming me for what happened. You can't. I've done everything. I've even talked to curtis. Yes, you did, and curtis talked to me. He gave me the acid test to see whether i loved him enough to give up all rights to his money, and then i realized it was you who provided the acid. But you're not fair. It's not true. I only said that- i know pretty well what you said. If i were you, curtis... if i were donna... i can just hear you, being so helpful and so helpless, helping to mess up people's lives for your own selfish purposes and just about as helpless as a wildcat. Somebody should have told the birds and bees about you. Go ahead, donna. I know you're not happy, and if it makes you feel any better, say whatever you please. Sacrificing to the end, aren't you, christabel? Only it doesn't fool me anymore. I'm not going to hold this against you, donna. You've been very good to me, and i'll never forget that, no matter what you say. That's very touching. I'm sure curtis will be deeply moved when you tell him how noble you've been to me, and after the way i've treated you. You wouldn't think that i could- i've stopped thinking. It's easier that way. I told my agent to rent the apartment, but don't worry, christabel. I'm sure of one thing- christabel will take care of christabel... every time. And then i told donna that i forgave her for all the things that she'd said and i didn't ever want her to feel ashamed. Don't worry. She wasn't. Uncle john, what did donna say about me? She said nothing about you. Nothing? Donna and curtis were in love, deeply in love. What happened, christabel? L-i can't imagine. Surely you don't believe that i had anything to do with it. Why did you confide in me unless you were afraid that donna had already told me? Or unless you had a guilty conscience? I confided in you because you're the nearest thing i've ever had to a father, because i love you and i need you. That's all very well, but- stop moving my papers about. I was tidying up your desk. Uncle john, how would you like me to help out while donna is away? I wouldn't like it. Look, christabel, you left business school, and since you're obviously not equipped to work in this office, i can't see any point in your not returning to santa flora and your aunt clara. But i like it here. I've got friends here. Nick is going to boston. My editor can't get away, so nick has to go there to work with him. He leaves on the midnight plane. So soon? You may as well return tonight. I'll send the car for you. But the ball is tonight. I'll make your excuses. But i've looked forward to it so. It's my first ball. Probably my last ball. Let me go back tomorrow. Another day won't make any difference. No. I guess it won't at that. Oh, uncle john, you do understand me. Curtis. Gobby, isn't this just like heaven? Don't ask me. I've never been there. You know what they're saying about curtis and donna? No. What? I don't know. I thought maybe you did. L-i wonder- curtis is on the terrace. Shall we dance? Oh, let's - let's say hello to uncle john. All right. Here's your niece, john. Good evening, uncle john. Good evening, christabel. Hello, gobby. Hello, curtis. How are you? You look lovely. Thank you. Curtis, my dear, it's going even better than last year. Money is just flowing in. That's because you always do everything so charmingly, mrs. Bolton. Hello, john. Hello. Mrs. Bolton, my niece christabel caine. Why didn't you tell me you had such a decorative niece? I would have put her to work selling programs. Well, next year. I'm afraid i won't be here. My niece is moving back to santa flora tomorrow. What a pity. Come along, john. I need you to start the bidding on the cadillac. So long as i don't have to end the bidding. You, too, curtis. When was all this decided about your going away? Uncle john thought it was best, and i suppose he's right. You see, donna- i mean, the apartment is sublet, so that sort of leaves me out in the cold. I'm sorry, christabel. I'll miss you. Will you, curtis? Why, of course i will. Maybe you blame me, too. Blame you for what? I'd rather not talk about it. I'd rather you had. What is it, christabel? You see, donna had the idea that what happened between you two was my fault. Your fault? Yes, and if you felt that way, i couldn't bear it. We can't talk here. Come on. But your guests. They'll survive. I hope i haven't upset you, curtis. Why should you think that i'd blame you for anything? Maybe-maybe i am to blame. Why do you say that? Well, i wanted to protect you. L-i wanted you to be happy, even if it meant sacrificing my own happiness. You shouldn't feel responsible for my happiness. L-i can't help it. Christabel, l- please, please don't say that. I've tried so hard to fight against what i feel. I didn't want you to know ever. You've been so sweet and kind to me, but that's your nature. It doesn't mean anything. Oh, it means a great deal. That's very generous of you, curtis, and charitable. I don't mean to be charitable. No. I know you didn't. It's just you. Well, i'd better be going home. I have a lot of packing to do. Don't look so unhappy, curtis. Don't worry about me. I suppose no one ever died of a broken heart. Christabel. Curtis, you do love me. Chris? Hello, nick. I thought your plane left at 12:00. It did. They have a habit of leaving whether i'm on them or not. Please. Please what? There'll be another one tomorrow night, and we'll be on it, both of us. I can't do that. Give me one good reason. I won't accept it, but give it to me anyway. I'm going to marry curtis carey. What did you say? I'm going to marry curtis carey. That's what i thought you said. Is he going to marry donna, too? Donna's gone away to london. So that's what you were up to. Nice going, christabel. Nick, i'm sorry i had to hurt you. Don't mind me. Don't mind donna, either. And while we're at it, let's throw in curtis. Curtis loves me. Come on. Let's get this over with. Tell me that you love him. He needs me. What do you think you need? It's not my fault that you fell in love with me. I didn't ask you to. And you didn't want to fall in love with me, but you did, in spite of "we're not good for each other, nick. "This thing between us is no good. It's just a sex attraction." You're right. It's all of that, and name me something better if you can. That's why you'll never get me out of your blood. That's why when you're with curtis, i'll always be there. Good-bye, mrs. Curtis carey. I'd like to say, "be happy," but you won't be. You'll just be lonely. Nick! You little fake, don't you know what you really want? Make up your mind and make it up now because i'm a restless guy. Hello? Curtis, darling. I was just sitting here thinking of you. Hold on a minute, please. Yes? Of course i'm happy. I love you, too, darling. I'll never be lonely again, will i? Good night, curtis. I think the wesley hospital committee has done an excellent job, and i'm very flattered that you want me on the committee, but i know so little about these things. My dear, we want you to join us. Besides, we can use your membership fee. Just $1,000. I'm afraid you'll have to ask curtis. There won't be any trouble about that. Will there, curtis? Exactly as it should be. I must say, i disapprove of women having anything to do with finances. Christabel was brought up in the old-fashioned way- in a little town and with no luxury at all. Really, aunt clara, i don't believe these ladies are interested in my life history. My dear, i didn't mean- i just meant that we hope curtis will keep you as simple and unaffected as you always have been. Don't we, john? I think we can leave that safely to curtis. Sorry. I must go. Can't you stay for dinner, john? No, thanks. Good night. Good evening. It was so nice having you here, uncle john. I wish you'd come more often. It was good to see your aunt clara enjoying herself so much. She's been very lonely in santa flora. It was sweet of you to ask her. Am i still your favorite niece? I was a little disturbed, especially when you and curtis were married so soon after donna- i guess those things happen. Good night, dear. When is nick bradley's book coming out? Pretty soon. We've had some delays. Have you seen him lately? No. He's still away, but he'll be back by publication date. Good night, uncle john. Good night, dear. Good night, arthur. Good night, sir. Do you know what day this is? No. What day is it? Close your eyes. Ooh, i love surprises. Happy 6 months anniversary. Oh, curtis, darling. Oh. Don't you remember? Yes. Of course i remember. The jewelry shop. I tried to give it to you then, and you wouldn't let me. Curtis, i don't want to seem ungrateful, but couldn't you find something for me that was just ours, especially ours, with nothing to do with the past or anyone else? I'm sorry. Your aunt clara thought you'd like it. So did i. I guess we were both mistaken. I'll get you something else. You're sweet. Then maybe you won't mind if i scold you just a little. Have i done something wrong? I do wish you hadn't told mrs. Bolton to see me about your membership fee. But, curtis, it is your money. Whatever i have is yours. You know that. You don't have to come to me. You spoil me. I couldn't possibly spoil anything as perfect as you. Aunt clara seems to be worried about whether you can keep me simple and unaffected. I think i can manage with her help. You two are very good friends, aren't you? I'm very fond of her. What's more, she's given me several pointers on how to treat a wife. You don't need pointers. After all, i was a bachelor before i was married. But i like being married. I like particularly being married to you. Curtis, i forgot to say good night to aunt clara. Aunt clara. Oh, christabel. I was waiting for our evening talk, and i dozed off. You let yourself get overtired. Taken your medicine? No. Not yet, dear. I'll fix it for you. Oh, christabel, you're so good to me, and it's so nice being here. I'm glad you've enjoyed it, and i'm going to miss you. Miss me? I wanted to keep you here a lot longer, but i don't dare. You don't want curtis to leave me, do you? Why, but, christabel, i thought curtis liked me. He told me he liked me. Darling, we've enjoyed every minute you've been here, but we don't want to impose on curtis' generosity, do we? Oh, no. No, indeed. No. I'll leave in the morning. Aunt clara, i'm going to miss you. Here. Take your medicine like a good girl. Christabel. You will come to see me. Of course i will, darling. Good night. Take your places, ladies. Last year, as you know, i wasn't actively concerned in the management of the ball, and i don't want to seem critical, but the decorations, for instance- a little to your right, mrs. Mayer. However, this year, with mr. Broome in charge, i don't think we need worry. All right. Hold it, now. Thank you. I also observed that the arrangements for selling tickets were handled in a most haphazard way. May i have one of you, mrs. Carey? Yes, of course. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Now, hold it. Thank you. If you'll excuse me, my husband's waiting, so go right ahead with the other details. And now, what's this i hear about your charging $2,500 for the decorations? This is christabel, remember? Aren't you donating anything? Of course i am. I'm only charging for my materials. I'm donating my genius. And how much is that worth? You couldn't afford it. Now, go away. I want to be alone with curtis. That should be a novelty. Darling, i'm sorry they held me up. Uncle john, how nice to see you. Would you like a drink? I'd love one. Did you finally get through with all your committees? Yes. I'm yours till dinner. That's fine. That gives me all of 15 minutes. Darling, don't sulk. After all, it's for charity. Did you bring the programs? I also brought you a copy of nick bradley's book. Oh, how nice. How is he? He's fine. Is he still in the east? He got back the other day, but i'm going to send him out again to do some promotion work with the women's clubs. You remember nick, don't you? Of course i do. My old competition. Don't be absurd, darling. Funny you should think i'd forget him. Why? What do you mean? It's just that i knew him a long time before i knew you. How is his book doing? It's too early to tell, but it had good reviews, and i think it may sell. Ask him to call us up, john. I'd like to see him. You heard uncle john say that he was going away. You and curtis ought to go away for a while, christabel. Why don't you go down to the lake? It would be pleasant. We'll think about it, won't we? I already have thought about it. You're tired. You need a rest. Please don't worry about me. Besides, i hardly ever see you anymore. You're always knee-deep in committees. And i've missed you, too, and there's nothing better that i would like than just the two of us going away together, but i can't right now. What is it, arthur? Miss foster on the phone for mr. Caine. Take it here, john. No, thanks. I'll use the one in the hall. I didn't know donna was back. Yes. She's been back with me a couple of weeks. Did you know? Yes. John told me. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't think you'd be particularly interested. I can't understand - neither one of you telling me. I hardly ever get a chance to speak to you. Now, let's get back to why we can't go away. The ball, for one thing. Darling, the ball has been held-and very successfully- for 25 years before you came. Darling, this isn't like you. I only took charge of the ball because i thought it would please you. You're sweet. I didn't know what i was getting into. No, there's something else upsetting you. Curtis, is it nick? No, it isn't nick. I'm glad it isn't because i wasn't the least bit upset the way you and uncle john made such a secret about donna's return. Ooh, look at the time. I must get dressed. So must you. All right, as soon as i finish my drink. Donna, why don't you set up some interviews with the press for friday, and on saturday, a cocktail party for the critics? Well, nick wants to go back east, doesn't he? Yes, he wants to go back. I don't want to go back. He'll love lecturing to all those women's clubs. I doubt that. I won't love it. I hate women, and i hate clubs. You'll do what you're told. I'll get plane reservations for him. Monday, if possible. Yes, monday. Uh... how's curtis? Oh, fine. Fine. See you in the morning. Good-bye, donna. Good-bye. How is curtis? He's fine. How can anyone be fine with a hook in his throat? I hope he's happy. I hope she's miserable. Now, then, you ready up there? All right. Let's go. Higher than that. Fine. Dixon will show you where to put that. Good. Good morning. Well, it's about time! Please, christabel, must you shout? You were supposed to be here at 9:00, and now it's 11:00. I had to do all the decorations. I must have got hold of a bad ice cube. Now that you are here, look at you. If you think i look bad, you ought to get a load of nick. What a farewell party. We said good-bye to everything, including the lining of my stomach. Got any tomato juice? Mm-hmm. When is he leaving? Monday, if he recovers. I don't know that i did, but if i did invite him to your clambake tonight... and if you did invite him, what did he say? He said something about wanting to come and see how the fish was rising to the bait. The boy was fractured. Yes, he certainly must have been. Telephone, mrs. Carey. Who is it, arthur? Mr. Caine, madam. Tell him i'm terribly busy and i'll call later. He said it was very urgent, madam. He's phoning from santa flora. Oh? All right. Oh, arthur. Yes, sir? Somewhere in this great big house, there must be a teeny little can of tomato juice. I'll bring it right out, sir. Do that, will you, arthur? What are you doing in santa flora, uncle john? Is anything wrong? I'm at your aunt clara's. A doctor phoned me about 3:00 this morning. She's... she's very sick, christabel. And i think it might help if you would come. I can't possibly come today with a party tonight and everything so... are you sure you're not worrying too much, dear? She's had these attacks before. But i'm afraid that this time it's... christabel, don't you think curtis would want you to come? I think curtis would want me to stay right here, but i'll be glad to ask him. Uh... i'll call later in the afternoon. Give her my love and tell her i'll be down to see her in a day or two. Bye. What's the matter? Is something wrong? It's aunt clara. She's not too well. I'm sorry to hear that. Why don't you run down and visit her for a few days? It's nothing serious. She'll be all right. Come and look at my lovely decorations. That's wonderful, christabel. I'm looking forward to our waltz, major. Good evening, mr. And mrs. Tudwell. Good evening. How are you? It's an awfully nice party. Enjoy yourselves, won't you? Everything's going so beautifully, christabel. You've been such a help, mrs. Bolton. Thanks, dear. How about giving the host a dance with the hostess? Why, of course, curtis. Excuse us, mrs. Bolton. Certainly. You can stop looking now. You found me. I was looking for gobby. There he is, right over there. Hello, gobby. Nick. Nick bradley. You remember my name. What a nice surprise. Hello, nick, gobby. Curtis. Hello, curtis. Here. You don't want that. Come on. I'll buy you a real drink. I understand you're quite a celebrity now. Yes. The critics say my novel is very promising. I don't know what it promises, but it's promising. Too bad you didn't bring copies. We could have raffled them off. Why don't you make a speech and tell us all about india? Scotch or bourbon? My book is about china. I'm glad you read it. Now you're being difficult. I suppose i will have to read it. Don't bother. I'll send you a synopsis. May i dance with your wife? Of course, nick. Go ahead. I'll have some scotch, curtis. Two scotches, please. Hello. Hello, nick. Well, there was this norwegian sailor. Ha ha! I want to hear about your book, but i want, right now, to hear about you. What about me? I wish you weren't going away so soon. Curtis and i hoped we'd see something of you. When are you going? Pretty soon. Where? Boston. Is boston amusing? Big laughs. What are you going to do on the trip? I'm going to plug my book. Donna bullied me into it. Dear donna... so capable and efficient, such a practical girl. You ought to see her change a tire. Nick, i didn't mean... i can't talk to you like this. Oh, mr. Broome. Do you think my husband would like to see a picture of me hanging over the fireplace? I think your husband would like to see you hanging anyplace. Ha ha! Well? Well... critics say i have a definite flair for brilliant dialogue. I'm glad to see you again. I find our meeting rather painful. Why did you come? Because i thought i could take you again, and i can't. I think i'll get out of here. Don't go. What do you want, christabel? You've got everything you went after, and it's very becoming. Do you think i'm happy? Bed of roses. It's not what it seems. You'll have to spell out what you mean. I'm not happy. No? I... i'm so confused. I... be careful. You're getting real again. Oh. Oh, nick. Nick, it's you. It's you. What are you going to do about it? I don't know. You're calling the shots. I've missed this. All i know is i have to see you again. So that's the way you want it? Sorry. I'm not cut out to be a backstreet boy, and i don't make dates with other men's wives unless they bring written permission from their husbands. So long, mrs. Carey. I love you so much, i wish i liked you. Oh, freddy. Excuse me, will you? Nick! Nick, i... sorry to disappoint you. Curtis, i... we'd better join our guests. I brought us up some coffee. Mmm, don't want any. I just want to go to sleep. And i want to talk. Oh, but, darling, i'm exhausted. Then have some coffee. I said i'd like to talk to you. Curtis, if it's about nick- nick is only part of what i want to talk to you about, christabel. I don't like our marriage. Curtis. You've very carefully arranged your life so that i never see you, and i want to know why. But, darling, it's so simple. It's because i'm your wife that all these demands are made upon me- committees and boards. I have committees and boards, too. You can get away from them if you want to. But of course i want to, and we will go away. We'll go tuesday. Nick's leaving on monday, isn't he? Yes. I think that's what he said. What has that to do with it? I was just wondering why you had to wait until tuesday. Why, if you think nick's keeping me here, it's too ridiculous. It's even more than that. It's shameful and degrading. It's not worthy of you. What does nick mean to you? He doesn't mean anything to me. He's a friend of mine, that's all- a friend of yours, as well as mine. And if you think his being here in town is- i've always trusted you, christabel. I'd like to go on trusting you. And i only want you to be happy, and i like our marriage. What is it that you want me to do? I asked you once to go away with me. You said no, gave the ball as your excuse. The ball's over. I'm asking you again. Don't make such a problem of it. Of course we'll go away, in a few days. That's not good enough. When do you want to go? Tonight. At this hour? At this hour. Yes, i think we should go out of town. Shall i pack for you? Hey, you, wake up. We're here. Good ride. It was wonderful. I needed it. Are you sure you don't mind taking this character back to the stables? Not at all. See you at lunch. Right. Pick us up at our cottage in about an hour. Fine. Christabel. Chris. You know what? Mm-mm. What? I ought to ring the desk, order some dinner. Can you do it without moving? Nope. Well, then don't. The day's passed so quickly. It must be almost dark. I've never been so happy. You're not confused anymore. You've finally decided what you want. Promise me it will always be like this. Promise. Now, i ought to order some dinner, and we ought to get started for the lake. Nick, you're not going with me. You can't. We have to do it right. I have to talk to curtis. Don't you think it would be better if i talked to him alone? Suit yourself. But i'll drive back with you. I don't want curtis to think i'm hiding out on him. Darling, let me handle this in my own way. What is your own way? Well... rather than talking to him tonight, wouldn't it be wiser to wait a little while? Well, i mean... so he asks for the divorce. I don't get it. You came to me today and told me that you'd made up your mind, that you wanted me. I thought you were definitely through with curtis. But i am. I will be. Which is it? Darling, i know how much you love me, and you mustn't be impatient. We oughtn't to hurt curtis any more than we have to, and meanwhile, we'll have days like this together, oh, darling, so many days. I told you once - i don't play that way. It still goes. But it's different now. We love each other, and we'll be together. Mm-hmm. You and me and curtis. Oh, darling, it's not going to be like that. You're so right it isn't! An honest woman would decide whether she wanted to keep her husband's money or take the man she loves, but not you. You're more resourceful. You're working it out so you can keep both. It's not true. What do you know about truth? You've been with me for 5 hours, and you've been lying to me every second of it. I haven't. Nick, i love you. I do love you. You love only one person in the world, christabel, and it's the love of a lifetime. Now, get out. You can't do this. You can't send me away. Oh, yes, i can. It's a lot easier than i thought. My only regret in kicking you out is that you'll go back to curtis, and that's a pretty filthy trick to play on any man. Now, beat it. Good evening. Good evening. Would you call mr. Carey at the lodge and tell him i'm on my way, please? Mr. Carey telephoned, ma'am. He's on his way home. He should be here in about a half an hour. Are you all right? Yes, of course. Good evening, arthur. Good evening, sir. Good evening, mr. Caine. May i have a cup of coffee, arthur, please? Yes. Sure. Curtis. Curtis darling, i stopped here on my way back, and arthur said that you were coming home. Why didn't you stay at the lake? Why did you leave? Didn't you get my note? I had to go to santa flora. Aunt clara was- i got your note. I'm sorry it ruined our nice weekend. You know how much it meant to me, and i tried to find you everywhere before i left. I waited, and i waited, and then i got so worried about aunt clara. You can imagine how i felt. Christabel, when i checked out of the lodge at noon, this long-distance call was charged to my bill. The hotel clarendon is where nick is staying, isn't it? I can explain that. Where were you today? I told you. I went to santa flora, and as for that, why, nick called me while i was out, and i returned his call. That's the least i could do. He just wanted to thank us for last night and to say good-bye again. How'd you find your aunt clara? She's fine now. She's been so restless. Poor darling. I heated her some broth, and she drank it just to please me, and then i read to her for over an hour. She's going to be all right now. I think my coming helped her. Your aunt clara died at 3:00 this afternoon, christabel. We tried all day to reach you. She wanted very much to see you. Good night, curtis. Uncle john, i... i never dreamt... uncle john! Curtis- i'll be gone exactly one week. Don't be here when i get back. Curtis is just coming in. Thanks. Curtis. I was afraid... afraid? Oh, not really, but you were looking up at the sky. Your thoughts must have been miles away. Not so far away, actually. When i married christabel, i gave up every other interest i ever had in my life- golf, tennis, most of my friends... even my work. Am i boring you? Oh, no, curtis, no. I want to hear this. And my whole life revolved around only one thing- desire for christabel. I made a big mistake when i gave up flying. Maybe i'm one of those people that has to back away from things to see them clearly... because once i'm up in that plane, all by myself, i can look down and see things as they really are, in their true proportions. The big and important things look big, and the little dirty things look like just that. Try to put up with me, donna. I almost lost you once. You're the only thing in my life worth having. Oh. Excuse me, please. Now, what about the furniture? I wouldn't want anything that belonged to curtis. It would only remind me of... happier times. Won't those remind you just a little? I'll simply have to force myself. Good-bye, madam. Good-bye, arthur. My portrait. That's mine. Curtis gave it to me for getting you out of the house. Even you couldn't be so despicable. Sure, i could. Listen, will you do me a favor? I didn't want to ask you, but if you'd just get yourself mixed up in one more little scandal, i'd be able to sell you for more money. It only stands to reason. What's happened already between you and curtis has made your price go up. Yes. You're right. Just a minute. Where's the key to the house? You're contemptible. No. I'm gobby, remember? The key. Uh, my portrait. May i have the key, sir? group and u.s. Department of education captioning performed by the Public performance of captions prohibited without
