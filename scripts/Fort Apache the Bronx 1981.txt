Shit, I been partyin' all the time. I'm a party girl. Well, party on home, baby. Take a little rest. Rest? I don't need no rest. I'm on the case, you know? Y'all wanna come party with me? Not now, baby. I got somethin' fine... for New York's finest. Well, we're on the job. Shit, I'm on my J-O-B too... just like you. Shit, an important job. Y'all just take a look at this. What is this, the gunfight at OK Corral? As long as there's cop killers around, I'm gonna be ready. Don't make no difference how many guns you got. You only got two hands. Murphy don't need no hardware. All you gotta do is breathe on the suckers, and they give up. You can't get your man with six bullets, you might as well go in with a tank. Anybody know those two guys? Loomis was in the car with us, wasn't he? Just out of the academy. The other one too. He was a rookie too? What was his name? What difference does it make? They still had their coffee in their hands when they got it. The head and the face, almost point-blank range. Sounds like a hit. Look at Beau Brummell over there. They could be dropping bombs on the Bronx... and he'd be standing there figuring out what jockey shorts went with his tie. Jealous. Typical bust-out cop reaction, you know? A guy's got a little style, tries to rise above his circumstances... and you gotta knock him. That's what we need, a cop with style. I ain't no 20-year man like you, baby. Look at the threads in there. I'm dressing for success. I got a self-image, man. Here he is, ladies and gentlemen. The Million Dollar Mouth. Wait until I cruise up here in my Bentley. Yeah, Bentley. Grab him! Get the needle out of his arm! - Hey, mofo, I ain't no junkie, man. - Give me some help here! Come on. Knock it off. - What's the charge? - Indecent exposure. Just showing his face is indecent exposure. Next patient. Goddamn switchboard's out again. I'll take a look at it. Pantuzzi, I'll need a car tomorrow to get my junk outta here. - You think you can arrange that? - Yes, sir. We're gonna miss you, boss. In two days, you won't even remember what I look like. Maybe in my last couple of days you can stop the bullshit. It's all right, though. You guys had it easy with me. This new guy'll cut you to pieces. Who's the new guy? Captain Dennis Connolly. I heard of him. He's a headquarters guy. Been kissing ass so long, he wipes his nose with toilet paper. Oy vay! A headquarters hero. I give him three months up here. We lost two guys on the 8-to-4 today. I'm sure youse all know about it. Got the reporters outside... and there's a special unit from downtown that's working on the squeal. They'll all be gone in a couple of hours, and we'll still be here. Now, until we clear this thing... we're moving targets. That's those of us that move. It's not a good idea to let the folks up here know... it's open season on cops. Now, you guys, every one of you, got your stoolies. Canvas your sectors, toss everybody. And never mind from downtown. It's on us to get some information on this. It'll be our asses if we don't. Okay? Enough said. All right. Got a rape of an 11 -year-old girl. Suspect described as black male, 6' 6"... 240 pounds, still at large. Victim has provided a sketchy description. It's over at the desk. We got complaints on a crap game in back of St. Anselmo's. The sisters called it in. That's sector Adam, Boyd and Williams. Don't move it. Bust it. All right? We gotta let 'em know they leave the church and the grounds alone. Track star on Brockton. This is a skinny dude with felony shoes... and a World War I pilot's cap. Right? Snatching purses from the welfare ladies. Now, as you probably know, Captain Dugan is retiring. He's been replaced by Captain Dennis Connolly. We were gonna throw Captain Dugan a racket... but with the different tours it didn't work. So we set up a collection to buy him a present. Any of you wanna contribute, there's a kitty on the sergeant's desk. Knock it off. You're dismissed. She never, ever went. - I did so! - You did not! The neighborhood will be full of stars with all these TV cameras around. People will be blowing each other away just to get on the news. You see a lot of fires 'cause they look real good on the tube. - A cop killing is a media event. - Big deal. Put a black border around his picture and give him an inspector's funeral. And people sending your ex-wife money from all over the country. She'd like that. Meanwhile, there ain't a chance of making a collar on this... with all these hooples around here. Look on the bright side, though. We get our names in the papers, right? We can be real serious on TV. With your good looks maybe you'll get to ball an anchor lady. Yeah? Ah, not with my luck. If it was raining anchor ladies, I'd get hit with Walter Cronkite. I'm going to fly! I want to fly! Mira. I don't want my blood to splatter all over you, my people. I know you're gonna miss me! Anybody know this guy? I do. He's my roommate, and I hope he breaks his stupid neck. Come on, Raquel. Don't you wanna kiss and make up? Hell, no! He stole my Donna Summer wig. - The bitch. - You the super? Yeah. Mind the car. I don't know about Carl anymore. I don't know what's the matter with him. - What are you wearing, Chanel no. 5? - No, it's Windsong by Matchabelli. Carl! Stay away! Hey, Carl? Wait a minute. Come on now. Think it over, huh? You can become a star if you wanted to. Go ahead. Put on the wig. Let's see what the wig looks like. Is Tom Snyder here yet? - No. He said to wait for him. - Tom! He said to wait here. Tom Snyder! Tom! I'm coming down, Tom! Carl, wait! No! I'm coming down! Is Tom out here? Is Tom Snyder here? All these people. My people. I love you, my people. Oh, fix my wig! Fix my wig. Oh, I'm a bad girl, bad girl Such a dirty bad girl Beep, beep Yeah! Yeah! Stop it! Tom Snyder! I want Tom Snyder! Hold it! I'm a bad girl! Such a dirty bad girl! Last chance for love I need the last chance I need the last dance For love - What happened? - Ajumper. We don't have psychiatric facilities here. So sedate him. - Send him to Bellevue in the morning. - Where's your medical degree? Back at the house. Wanna come by and see it? Nurse, see if this guy has major medical. What are they gonna do with me, Murphy? - You don't need these cuffs anymore. - I don't wanna go to jail. You got it all wrong, Carl. - This guy ain't going to jail. - No way. Don't worry about it. Hey, Isabella. We ain't filing a complaint. Just put him down as a patient. If you say so. See, Carl? Everything is gonna be okay. I'm all messed up. Ain't we all? - We'll be back to see if you're okay. - Thanks, Murphy. It'll take about an hour. - Good. Let's go eat. - Bye, Andy. So long, Slick. Take care of yourself. So, what'll it be? Puerto Rican, Puerto Rican or Puerto Rican cuisine? Decisions, decisions. Isn't that our man up there? - The guy with the World War I cap. - I don't wanna chase this dude. The big, bad policemans is here, so don't rip nobody off. - Son of a bitch! Right in our faces! - Let's get him. Murphy, Murphy, Murphy. You got a cigarette? - Why didn't you just drop the bastard? - Here. Oh, yeah, right. Shoot a purse snatcher. They'd crucify me. You say he pulled a knife, and we back you up. That's all you gotta do, Murph. You lay it on 'em. I know how to flake a guy as good as you do, Morgan. You'll get a heart attack before you ever catch a nigger, Tarzan. What's his problem? He thinks I'm a liberal. Get back here, you motherfucker! My recollection don't recall it. I don't remember. What do you want? Captain Dugan's office. Don't you monitor the people who ask to see the commander? What if I was a lunatic with a gun? Then you wouldn't be a police officer, Captain Connolly. Or would you? What's your name, Sergeant? Kickin' ass and taking names, huh, Captain? Well, I'm Sergeant Anthony Pantuzzi. I got 22 years on the job... and I'm ready to retire tomorrow if I get a hard time from my new commander. I'll take the half pension before I'll take any crap from anybody. Captain Dugan's office is over on the right... as close to the street as he can get. Thank you, Sergeant. Come in. Captain Dugan. - Connolly. - Yeah. You picked a great day to take over. This place was jammed with reporters all morning. Page one of your first day up here. - You like press conferences? - They're part of the job. That's for sure. They put it out you volunteered for this job. - I did. - I'll tell you something. You'll do better walking the beat in Beirut than you will here. You're supposed to have some background material for me. Yeah, I got it. Block-by-block rundowns. Ongoing investigations, trouble spots... community people... personnel evaluation. I'm interested in the ratio of rookies to veterans. I didn't break it down that way. Two rookies in a car is always a mistake. So I'm going to be blamed for those killings? And I'll be blamed till they're cleared. How about corruption? Anybody on the job now in my precinct is clean. Your precinct has the worst absentee record in the city... the most disability claims... the highest percentage of men on sick call... the least convictions per arrests, and there are no men on the take? So they toss a numbers runner for a couple of dollars... turn a pimp upside down for some loose change. There's nobody getting rich up here. There's nobody doing anything. These men aren't motivated. Motivated? I mean, this is Siberia, Connolly. Sixty-five percent of the men here have been transferred. We got the connivers, the slobs, the shirkers... guys who beat up the wrong guinea... who gave a diplomat a parking ticket... screwed a bigmouth hooker or shook down the wrong peddler. There are plenty of good police officers in your command. You're the one falling down on the job. That's right, blame Dugan. Sure, let the politicians and everybody else off the hook. Blame Dugan. That's the easy way. You got a 40-block area with 70,000 people... packed in like sardines, smelling each other's farts... living like cockroaches, and that's Dugan's fault. You got the lowest income per capita, the highest rate of unemployment... and that's my fault. Why aren't I out there getting all these people jobs? The largest proportion of non-English-speaking population... in the city. Dugan's fault. Why ain't he out there teaching 'em to speak English? Four percent Spanish-speaking cops on the force. Hey, Dugan, get your ass out in the barrio and recruit. Families that have been on welfare for three generations. Youth gangs... winos, junkies... pimps... hookers... maniacs... cop killers. - You finished? - Yeah, I'm finished. I'm going to Florida, Connolly. I'm going fishing. So you can bring up your computers and your slide rulers... and all your psychological techniques. I mean, this neighborhood'll bury you. There's enough dirt in this precinct to bury every smart-ass cop in the city. What you readin'? Oh, Jesus. Another one of them self-help stroke jobs. Why don't you read something ordinary like Dick Tracy or the Yellow Pages? No, man. This is crucial. See, you don't understand. People give out a certain kind of message with their clothing. Oh, yeah? I'll be out of these pajamas in a couple of years. How about that fashion plate? What's his message? What the fuck you talkin' about, huh? - The bitch is treacherous, man! - Keep it off the streets. I put her out on the line, and she don't come back with nothin'. She used to be the main whore on the set. - It's not that bad. - She could pull anybody. Pull 'em out of a goddamn Cadillac... doin' 75 on the FDR. But now she ain't worth nothin'! Nothin', the motherfuckin' bitch! You gonna run this guy a benefit? I'm not kidding you, man. The bitch is nuts, man. She been smokin' that angel dust, you dig? I mean, that shit'll make you crazy. I mean, I can't even deal with it! Just keep it off the street, huh? Let's run a nice, clean sector here. Come on. Yeah. I don't know you, huh? - Do we sit in the same pew? - I guess not. Easy there, Wild Bill. I'm just going for my wallet. I wanna show you my driver's license. That's a nice coat. How'd you like me to cut it open and let all the rats out? This coat cost more than you make in a year, motherfucker. He knows your name. I told you I was famous. - That's yours, huh? - Yeah. That's legally parked. - Oh, motherfuck! - That's a defective headlight. Oh, shit! Man, that's my car! No windshield wipers. Don't try to buy me, you scumbag! Try to grease me again, and I'll turn your head like a doorknob. Murph, slow down, man. Come on. - Keep it off the street! - Come on, Murph! What's the matter with you all of a sudden? Son of a bitch thinks he can own me for a couple of bucks. Like he owns a lot of other cops. He's just doin' business. Like we do too, huh? We're living in a world we never made, my man. Keep it off the street! Everything's cool. Get over here, bitch. What's wrong with you, Charlotte? Now you're puttin' the man on me. What the fuck's gotten into you? Get over here. You want it? What's all this Indian junk? Well, the precinct is nicknamed Fort Apache. The men put that up, Captain. Guy goes on vacation, he brings back some kind of souvenir. It makes the place look like a fraternity house. - Take it down, Lieutenant. - It's not a good idea, Captain. Let's see about gettin' this place painted. That's a problem. Painters won't come up here. We'll have to get those civilians out from in front of the precinct. Can't do that. Excuse me? This is the only place the old folks can go without getting mugged. It's the same with the mothers and kids. This isn't a police station. It's a fort in hostile territory. You understand? Fort Apache. Here's the final disposition. - How's he doing? - He's resting now. We're sending him to Bronx State. He'll be okay. You wanna go have a drink? Two hundred cops ask me out every day. Why should I say yes to you? 'Cause you say yes to all the others. I guess that makes you the only cop I say no to. My, you certainly have a way with women, don't you? - She's crazy about me. Can't you tell? - Oh, yeah. In an abandoned store right here there's a drug operation. We traced it to the hospital. Narcotics has got a man inside now. - The hospital? - Yeah. There have been reports of thefts of morphine... surgical cocaine, syringes. Also, sales of drugs in the hospital. These rookies could have stumbled on a felony in progress. Those guys were shot at almost point-blank range. Even a rookie's gonna make a move if he sees something's going on. No information from the street so far? Are you kidding? Anyplace else, a guy sees a cop get killed, he runs to the phone. Here, the doors close. There could be five people out there who know who did this. In a few hours, ten, maybe more. But not us. Up here, Captain, cops are like husbands. They're always the last to know. Don't she know enough to come out of the rain? He didn't kill her. Must be our good deed for the day. - What was this all about? - Ambulance call. Sure don't like to go into dark buildings with cop killers around. Decisions, decisions. Okay, what's goin' on? Okay, hold it. Hold it. All right. Hey, kid. How are ya? Murph, how do you say "room"? Calle. No, that's street, I think. Sala. She's havin' a bambino. You speak English? Yes. - How old are you? - Fourteen. You know something about babies, then, 'cause I think you're having yours now. - No. - Yeah. You have to. I know. You kept your coat on for four months. You didn't tell nobody. You can't hide it now. It's okay. We'll help you, okay? I gotta wash my hands. Make sure she don't pass out. Come on. You gotta help me. Come on. Come on. That's good, that's good. Come on, Nina. Come on. You're almost there. Come on. Push. Push. Keep trying. Here we go. Here we go. It's coming now, Nina. It's coming. All right. Dr. Silverman, call your office, please. Dr. Cosmo, you're needed in Surgery. Hey, bro. What's happenin'? Listen. No credit this time. Sorry, man. Got a brand-new badge. Nice cut on it. - What can I do for you? - I'm gonna cop a bundle. Get your money ready. Money, money, money, money. Okay, bro, what you want? You don't look too good. This will take it out. Do two. It'll straighten you out. Look, I'll catch you guys later. All right? I think you guys are trying to take my job. - What's the matter with him? - Postoperative depression. He just delivered a baby. You all right? Oh, yeah. That's my 17th in 14 years up here. Seventeen. You could almost be an obstetrician. You need a drink. I need a nurse. You supply the booze, I'll supply the nurse. You asking me out? Maybe. I get asked out by 200 nurses every day. Why should I say yes to you? 'Cause you say yes to all the others. See if you can find your way back here at midnight. You take more time getting ready than my old lady does. If that's a proposition, I'm already engaged. - Sorry, pal. - Man's got a heavy date tonight. Man's gonna score. The man is seeing his fiancee tonight... which means the man's gonna get shut out. Back off. You're talking about the woman I love. You know what a nice Catholic boy means when he says he's in love? It means he ain't gettin' no cho cha. No cho cha for the kid. - No cho cha. - Not even a cho. You scruffy Irish potato eater. What do you know about style, huh? What do any of you know about style? Look at youse. I'm giving out a heavy message tonight with these clothes. What is that? The message is: Take me! Please take me! A whole year we've been goin' out. I'm gettin' back pain from the anxiety. - Please! - Poor little baby. Please take me! We're gonna need a padded patrol car for this fruitcake. I didn't think you'd come. I had to break a date with Charlie's Angels. I hope you don't regret it. Hey, cowboy! Tough guy. What's he doin'? Going out with nurses now? It makes sense. He catches something from her, at least she can cure it. - Date night? - What'll you have? - Bacardi and Coke. - Me too. No beer? What is it, your birthday? - Make 'em doubles. - You won't get me drunk. - For how much? - My money's on the lady. - You wanna join us? - Excuse me! She always gives me the cold shoulder. Now all of a sudden she wants to talk. She's jealous. Theresa. Shh, Andy. I got pizza. Pizza. Come on. Open the front door. Go on. Andy, it's after midnight. Just let me come in for a minute. Open the door. For God's sakes, my parents are sleeping. Listen, if you don't wanna do nothin', how come you wear outfits like that? You want me to wear a cop's uniform to bed? Let me come in for a second. One second. Come on. Don't get crazy on me now. Nah. Don't worry about it. Just gonna eat the pizza, I promise. Don't worry about nothin'. - Bad? - Yes. I can't believe I'm on a date. You don't do this all the time? How about never? Why? You married? No, I'm not. Well, I'm not married now. I was. I don't know why I'm having so much trouble with this. I'm divorced. It's no big thing. - Kids? - Yeah. Three girls. So what about you? So what about me what? Well, tell me a little something about yourself. That's what you're supposed to do on a date, isn't it? Yeah, only I don't like talking about myself. Well, I don't like talking about myself either. So let's talk about two other people. I'll tell you about yourself, you tell me about myself. The one who's right wins a drink. Okay. You start. - Square business? - Tell it like it is. Poor family. You're the oldest. You got a lot of brothers and sisters. You got a brother in the joint. Your mother's sick. You got a scholarship to nursing school and did real good... but you can't get a job anyplace but here. - How am I doin'? - I don't know yet. You smoke a little reefer, fool around a little bit. You ought to get married, but the selection ain't that good. Finished? Yeah. You come from three generations of cops. Your grandfather and your father and your brothers are all cops. All your friends are cops. It's a good thing there are lady cops, or you wouldn't have any sex life. You get drunk every night. You think all men are thieves and all women are sluts... and you don't trust anyone but your partner. It's my round. No. The drinks are on me. Theresa, am I stuffed. You could've at least had one piece. It wouldn't kill ya. No, I'd just gain a hundred pounds. "I'd just gain a hundred pounds." - We'd work it off. Come on. - Andy, stop it. My parents. They're sleeping. Don't worry. My father gets up every night for Brioschi. Oh, man. If your father's stomach's gonna mess up my sex life, forget about it. Come here. Yeah, I'll come here. Don't you think I want to? I don't know. Do you? I do. I do! Can't it wait till we're married? Wait until we're married? No, see, you don't understand. You keep forgetting that I'm a cop. Any day that I go to work could be my last. - Today we almost got blasted. - I don't wanna hear it. Five guys opened fire. They started blastin'. Now, that's more like it. How long have you been a cop? Eighteen years. It's too long. You ought to at least be commissioner by now. You sound like my ex-wife. No, I made detective. I got a gold shield. I just didn't keep it very long. What did you do? Come on. What did you do? I nailed this guy on Westchester Avenue. He was going about 65 miles an hour. He's really drunk. He's all over the road. And he was a local hood. He was a guy that I put in before for extortion. So, anyway, the next day, the guy gets out. He drives his Caddie by, gives me the finger. So on this one he just laughs in my face. He says, "A summons?" He said, "My God, my lawyer's gonna take care of this tomorrow, you jerk." So I thought, I said... "The guy's right, I'm a jerk." So, I leaned across, grabbed his car keys and threw it in the sewer... and said, "See if your lawyer can take care of that tomorrow." This guy is jumpin' up and down and yellin' at me. And... - I ate his driver's license. - What? Yeah. And right after that, I ate his registration. The registration tasted better than the driver's license. Well, he said... "My lawyer's gonna make one call and you're finished." I said, "Finished?" So I laughed in his face. The lawyer made the call... and they took away the shield... and put me back in a monkey suit. Well, the moment of truth. Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drinks. Anytime. I guess I ought to be flattered that you're not makin' a move on me. It means you respect me. I don't go to parties where I ain't invited. You want an engraved invitation? - What is that, a walk-up? - And I'm on the fifth floor. Let's climb that staircase to paradise. Let's go to your place. You got any other names besides Murphy? Hey, don't get personal. I'll remember you said that when we get to your place. What? John Joseph Vincent III. Satisfied? Big name. Ah, big man. We'll see about that. You don't need a girlfriend. You need a maid. Ain't they the same thing? Uh-uh, baby. You're in the wrong century. Yeah? Help, police. I'm glad we did it. Are you? Glad we did what? Wise guy. Did you enjoy it? Yeah, it was all right. It was just all right? There wasn't enough pepperoni on it... and the anchovies tasted like shoe leather. I didn't mean the pizza. I meant me. Oh, you? Yeah, yeah, you were okay. But there wasn't enough pepperoni on it... and the anchovies tasted like shoe leather. Shut up. Just shut up. John Joseph Vincent Murphy III. You called? J.J. Yeah,J.J. That's what I'm going to call you from now on. No, you ain't. Murphy. A big Irish cop. How can you work in a neighborhood like this? You think I can't understand these people? The Irish are a lot like the Puerto Ricans. They are the Puerto Ricans of England. They like to drink and dance and sing... make love. I'm talking about the ones on the other side. Something happens to them when they come over here. They become a bunch of tight-assed priests... or ward heelers. What the hell am I talkin' about? Son of a bitch! I have to pull off the highway into this jungle. Come on! Hello, lover. You wanna go out? Come on. Let's take a little walk. How much? Well, if I was sellin' it, baby... you sure couldn't afford it. But I'm gonna give it up... 'cause I likes you. How you doin'? This ain't a motel, baby... but it'll do just fine. It looks okay to me. Nobody can do it like I can. Come on down. Sit right there. Yeah. Yeah. "Scorpio. Recreation will leave a potential for employment. Money comes in early June. A fantasy comes true in September." This is the life. - Yeah. Just don't get too used to it. - Tough guy, huh? That's right. You're not tough. You're a pussycat, just like me. My water's boiling. - No! - Yes. Hey, punk. Man, what a racket. You know what the number was yesterday? - What? - Number 444. Except for a little single action, we cleared 3,200 bucks. Sometimes I think bookies have a patron saint. You'll pray to that saint when they bust your little operation. Maybe it'll get you 90 days instead of a year. You're just uptight because you didn't get laid last night. - What are you, Joyce Brothers? - Leave me alone. Hey, Pop, would it be a first-class piece of detective work... to assume you've been downstairs pressin' the grapes? I got four barrels ready for Christmas. I got this guy all the way from Jersey ready to buy my wine. My brother's a bookie, my father's a bootlegger. I could make a fortune shaking down my own family without leaving the house. What are you laughing at? Knock it off. Don't start with me, punk. What's this South Bronx People's Party that keeps comin' up? They're disco revolutionaries. You know what I mean? They got federal money to open a storefront on Fox Street. They make a lot of hate-cop noises. They preach armed revolt... but they spend most of their time ballin' white chicks from Scarsdale. Dacey, you followin' through? Yeah, we're gonna pay 'em a visit. Might go to Scarsdale first. Might as well, for all the production we've been gettin' from you down here. What am I, a mind reader? You got 50,000 potential cop killers in this precinct. You want me to toss them all? I want you to bring the South Bronx People's Party in for questioning. That's what I want. The boss wants production. What we're gonna do is take a few anti-crime units out of each tour. You guys will be plainclothed, unmarked car. Mulhearne and Tessitore. Lane and Baker. - Corelli and Murphy. - Corelli don't got no plain clothes. Let him wear a tuxedo. What do I care? The idea is to make a lot of felony collars, okay? I'd like a minute, Sergeant. Hold it down, fellas. Hold it down. The captain has something to say, all right? We are making zero progress on the investigation... of the murders of our two men. This case must be cleared... even if we have to take extraordinary measures to clear it. Every day that we lag is another day that we lose respect... in the neighborhood. Pick it up. Startin' on this tour... I'm gonna want you to start makin' arrests. All of you know of criminal situations that exist. Up until now, you looked the other way. That's gotta stop. Every suspect that we bring in... will be questioned by the squad. We're gonna bring 'em in, book 'em... toss 'em and see what they spit out. And we won't quit until we get a lead. Now... I don't expect something for nothing from you men... so I'm offerin' a deal. You collar us somebody who gives us information... you get a week added to your vacations. Ah, who's gonna be minding the store when we're all on vacation? Sir. I don't follow you. Well, we could all go around with our noses buried in the penal code... we could make a hundred bum collars a day. So the jails will be full, the neighborhood will be empty... and meanwhile you ain't gonna be one step closer to clearing those killings. If you're afraid to do some police work, Murphy... you can stay in and clean out the shit houses until your retirement. Shut your mouth, Murphy. As for the rest of you, my offer stands. Two leads? Two weeks, and so on. Call it bribery. Call it dedicated police work. Just get out on the street and bring in those cop killers. I won't question your motives. Okay, knock it off. You're dismissed. Let's go downstairs and get into something more comfortable. Come on. Plain wheels, plain clothes, plain brains. Plain, plain. What are you always putting yourself down for, huh? Uh-oh. I feel a lecture coming on. You need one. I appreciate you more than you do yourself. - I can see your hidden potential. - You got good eyes. A guy like you with all you got goin' for you? Shit, you could conquer the world. Instead you keep holdin' yourself back. You gonna be my guru, huh? You gonna tell me how to release the hidden powers within? I tell you. I can give you some tips based on my extensive study of the road to success. - Yeah? - Yeah. The first thing you're gonna have to deal with... is this problem you seem to have with authority figures. You have a lot of trouble taking orders, am I right? You have what they call very low self-esteem. Before you make any progress at all in your life... you're gonna have to get in touch with your feelings. I keep trying, but the line's always busy. Is this stoolie reliable? We'll soon find out. - I'm calling my lawyer. - Yeah? - Never mind that, tons of fun. - Hey, what's the matter with you? I'm gonna give this bastard a workout! Come on! What's the matter with him? He's a little upset because of those cop killings. I'm no cop killer. Cops are my best customers. You ain't seeing no lawyer till I'm finished with you, fatso! Hey, hey, cut it out! We're here to see if we can get a lead on that case. Talk to the creep across the hall. He's been dealing guns for weeks. All right. Take it easy. Calm down. You'll give yourself a heart attack. Okay. Please don't tell him I gave him up. - He'll kill me. - Don't worry. Listen, arrest yourself. Go wait in the van. Okay. Watch it, man. He's mean. He's stoned on downs all the time. He blasts his goddamn radio at all hours. Some people got no consideration. Wanna go in? I don't hear no radio. He could be sitting behind that door with an M-60. Shit. That's okay. Fire! Nice touch. Not her. Not her. This guy does all right. Him. Okay, sports lovers. Police. Knock it off. All right, music lovers. Out of the cars. This is a raid. Come on. Get out of the car and on the pavement. Let's go. - Give us a fuckin' break. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What about last week, man? Last week don't count. Come on, John, let's go. Hey, you, let's go. Get out. Get out, man. A little scene here. - Move it. - I know you're comin'. Long time no see. How's everything? I know it is. Get out of here. Andy, get those guys out of the van. We're gonna grab a bus. How you been? Long time no see. Come on, ladies. Come on, let's go. This ain't no picnic. Police business. We're taking the bus. Hey, this is a ball, you know? I always wanted to drive a bus. Hey, come on. Cheer up. Yeah, cheer up, cheer up. We got a bus full of cop killers here. Super sleuth strikes again. You're letting that Connolly guy get to you again. Forget about him. The guy's an empty suit. He acts like we're a bunch of jerk-offs. All we want to do is drink and screw. Hell, there ain't one guy in this house who wouldn't give his right arm... to get the guys that killed those two rookies. I know guys who'd shoot their mothers and their feelings wouldn't get hurt. You can't go turnin' this neighborhood upside down... every time somebody gets killed, not even a cop. Let's get the fuck out of here. Get out! Come on in. Come on. Let's go. Innkeeper, we need lodgings for the night. Don't leave 'em here, Murphy. Please, put 'em up on the stairs. I'll book 'em after I get through with this bunch. Please. We'll be here all night with this group. All you guys, listen! Book your people, then move 'em up to the squad... so the detectives can talk to them. We'll authorize overtime for all the men on the 8-to-4... so we can process the suspects. It's like Grand Central Station. How are we gonna get the next tour out? - Knock, knock. - What is it? - We got a bit of a riot building up. - Where? In the Bronx. I wouldn't bother you if it was in Philadelphia. Special Investigations sent some people to that clubhouse and they went to war. We've had three 10-13s. The crowd's heading for the precinct. Call every available car off patrol and get some backup from Borough. Hey, you got a filthy mouth. What happened here? We went in to question them, and they started to give us a hassle. Why weren't my desk officers informed about this? Why wasn't I informed about the following those people have here? You sent us out on this. You should have told us what we were getting into. - Name, please. - I ain't tellin' you my name. We ain't tellin' you nothin' till you tell us why we've been arrested! They cooperating? They ain't even being sociable. You think we killed your cops, man? We wouldn't waste the bullets. You wanna go to war with me, tough guy? I've got 17 assaults and 5 assassinations of officers to clear. I'll nail your ass to the precinct wall if you hassle me. Do you understand? We were at a nuclear power teach-in... all day that day. At Sarah Lawrence, man. You want to check it out? We've got 500 witnesses. You want to go up against 500 honky college girls, man? - Go ahead. - Yeah, stiff, go check it out. Then you can let us out. Hey, hey, stiff! You wanna tell me your name again? Let the brothers go! Let the brothers go! Let me across, ladies. That's it. Out of the way. Lovely. N.G. On that bunch of revolutionaries up there. - The only thing they shoot is beaver. - Let the brothers go! Let the brothers go! - You the leader here? - Ain't no leaders here, man. - Just one soul with a million voices. - You're interfering with the police! - Let our brothers out of that dungeon. - That's a violation of the law. If you do not cease your activity, I will place you under arrest. You let our brothers outta your dungeons, then we'll leave. I'll give you five minutes to disperse. Let the brothers go! - Give them five minutes to disperse. - We've had these things before. You let them blow off steam a little, they go away. Give them five. Then release tear gas into the crowd. Let the brothers go! Gas 'em. Fall back. Let's go. Everybody back. Let's go, guys. Back. Way back. Come on. Okay, Jimmy. Release the gas. - What the hell is he doing? - He's going to war. You two! - Come with me. - Dutch treat? What did you say? I got no beef with these people. You're just making things worse. You've forgotten how to take orders, Patrolman? Get him! The field jacket! - Damn it! - Watch it! Sergeant. Book this man for incitement to riot... assault, attempted assault... criminal anarchy, disturbing the peace. You men give your names as arresting officers. When he's been booked, bring your prisoner to the squad room. You think you can hold me here? You think so, you jive-ass mother... We don't want you in here. Cool it, let us book you, you'll be on the streets in an hour. - Can the revolution wait that long? - It'll wait. Give your name to the nice sergeant. Let's go to work! My, my, you're in a positive mood today. I'm in love. "I'm in love." In the 41 precinct, a report of a 10-13. Assist patrolman, 163 and Fox... in the 41 precinct. Report of a 10-13. What the hell happened? We came out on this fire, they started bombin' us from the roof. Up there! Murphy and Corelli, get up on that roof. - Police. - Hold it. Police officers. - Freeze. - Against the wall. Spread 'em out. Come on, spread 'em out! Come on, spread 'em. - Man, what the... - Hey! Come on, let's take a little nap with your friend down here. - Look at this over here. - What? Look at this. Young love up on the roof there. It's a cheap date. Instead of going to the movie, they walk up on the roof... and watch the buildings burn. Uh-oh. Would you look at them muffs. Yeah, Morgan and Finley, what a couple of hotshots, huh? Hey, Morgan! They can't hear you. What... Hey! Hold it! Morgan, you asshole! Leave the kid alone. Hey, he didn't do nothin'. Hold it! Put me down! - Hold it! - Hey! Did you see that? I didn't see nothin'. Will you just disperse, please? Nothin's gonna happen here. We'd like to get your cooperation here. Stand behind the barricades. Cooperate with your police department. Will you go home, please? Back up a little bit there, please. Just back up. Thank you very much. Don't wanna see anybody get hurt. I don't feel very sartorial tonight. Partner? You okay? Murph? What do you mean, "okay"? I mean, you're not gonna go out and do something crazy, are you? Like what? I don't know. That's what scares me. Let's go out for a drink. You know, I've been on this job 18 years. I think every minute of it is on my face. Of all the blood, the beatings, the scams. Not here, Murph. I could walk into Grand Central Station, everybody would know I was a cop. People only know what you tell 'em. - You can fool anybody. - I'm lookin' you right in the eye. - You know what I see? - This ain't the place for this. I see that kid fallin' off that roof. I'm lookin' you right in the eye, and that's what I see. That'll pass. You know it will. I wonder what my face is gonna look like tomorrow. What the hell are you doin' in my car? The body was discovered after the fire. Death was caused... by injuries sustained in a fall. Now, we have witnesses who say they saw... two cops throw the decedent off a roof. Anybody got anything to say? I didn't throw anybody off a roof. I didn't throw anybody. Wait a minute. What day was that again? Donahue. Don't try to cover this with jokes. Sorry, Captain. Anything else? Maybe one of those witnesses threw the decedent off the roof... and they're trying to lay it on us. That's occurred to me. Everybody's always looking to knock us anyway, Captain. Especially up here. People don't appreciate cops up here. I'm aware of that. I just wanted to go on record with you men. I'll go straight to the wall with you on this... as long as I'm satisfied that you're clean. That's all. Murphy, you wanna hang in for a second? I didn't hear any denials from you just now. I don't like suckin' around in public. I want you to look me in the eye and say you know nothing about that homicide. I didn't throw no kid off no roof. And you don't know who did. Are you askin' me or are you tellin' me? Get outta here. What happened? What did he say? Nothin'. He took me off his Christmas list. Quit foolin' around and tell us what happened. - Listen... - Hey, hey! Will you go to your room? The man don't feel like talkin' now. So they bring this guy out. They hoist him up. His hands... His hands are tied behind his back. He's got 95 bullet wounds. Hey, Murph, come down here and join the party. - Where you goin' with that? - I'm taking your beer down here. Leave it! Sure. Collection time. Okay, girl, come on. Go on, mama. Get the money ready. This man needs some bread. She's all right. She's just a little too high. Got yourself a new old lady, huh? Hey, baby, what's happenin'? Don't worry about her. She's okay. I ain't worried. - I'm interested. - Hey, Jose. Everybody knows you got a joint. Let's get down to business, all right? Come on, hustle. Get the money. Get the money! Move! Jose, why don't you chill out, man? Stop messin' with the bitch. Shit, man. I think I'm in love. Hey, baby. Pretty little boy. Yeah, baby, that's me. Did you ever see a snake... little boy? Yo, Hernando, check this out, bro. Check this number out. A snake has a dance... and a snake has style. And a snake will sneak up on you every time... and give you that smile... with its tongue comin' out. Oh, yeah, baby, do it. A snake's a cold-blooded killer, baby. But you don't care... 'cause you're too busy lookin'. You goddamn whore! Drop that! She cut my face! - Bitch. - Drop it! You killed her! Oh, shit. She's dead. Oh, my God, she's dead. Shut up! It's your fault for having her here in the first place. She's no pig. She's nobody, man. Wrap her up. Let's get her outta here. Roll up this thing. Get up. Get back! Get over there! Do it. Aw, shit. You gonna have a drink with me or not? Murph, what do you think of that son of a bitch, huh? Connolly. Captain Connolly. That clown they dress up as a cop. That fuckin' banana. Who does he think he's playing with, some chickenshit rookie? I been on the job too long. You know what I mean? Yeah, they may get me for coopin' or scorin' a little nooky on the side... or maybe even shakin' down a bodega. I never said I was the smartest guy in the world... but when he comes up with this phony witness shit... They got witnesses, Einstein. Deaf and dumb ones, right? Real live ones. The kind that put you away. Hey, Murph! Murphy, come here! What are you talkin' about? They got the little chick that was hiding behind the junk pile. What chick? Yeah, they got me and Corelli too. A-number-one police work. Poor kid wasn't bothering nobody, you throw him off the roof! You shut the fuck up! You fuckin' creep, I wish I was man enough to turn you in! You motherfucker, I'm gonna turn you in! - Shut your mouth! - Are you gonna write me up? You bring me out on something like this? I gotta keep two cops from killin' each other, huh? "Write you up," you piece of shit. You're lucky I don't shoot you. Now, get out of here. Go run your car into a tree. Get your fuckin' hands off me! Get the fuck off! Get him home. You call in sick tomorrow. I don't need nobody to take me home. Nobody! Go on, break it up! Shut up! All right, man. We'll take care of the window tab. All right, let's get the hell out of here! Breakfast time. How'd you get into this? Clendennon called me. I figured you'd be up here. - Here. - You like being a den mother? I'm your friend, right? So I look out for you. I'm glad he called me. I'm givin' Morgan and Finley away. You gonna back me up? Why not? They killed that kid for no reason. - They're no good anyway. - I know that. So? So I can't be a stool pigeon. The kid's dead. We can't help him. We'll just make trouble for ourselves. So we just let those two guys get away with murder, huh? Another Puerto Rican is dead. Why worry about it? - I didn't say that. - It's the neighborhood, it's the world. It's this, it's that. People get shit on so much, a little more don't make no difference. - I didn't say that either. - We're cops. We gotta stick together. We gotta cover each other. Meanwhile, boy, if that kid had been Irish or Italian... He wouldn't be living up here in the first place. He'd be in Ireland gettin' blown away, or in Italy gettin' murdered by his own. You read the papers. We're not gonna change the world by givin' two cops away. That's just talk, Andy, and you know it. We both know what's right. We ain't got the guts to do it. Guts? What are you talkin', guts? You mean brains, don't ya? Shit, I'll go through fire with you, and you know I will. But I gotta live with these guys. You turn a cop in, and you're finished. Might as well quit the force and move out of the city. Even if you get a transfer, your rep follows you around. It just ain't worth it. Especially when you won't be doing anybody any good. I ain't a stool pigeon, Murph. I'm sorry. - Is that what I'd be? - These guys have families. - Is that what I'd be to you? - You want me to say it? You turn two cops in, and you're a rat, yeah. Come on, let's get out of here. Get something to eat, take a shower, you'll feel better. You don't wanna spend your day off in the Bronx, huh? Come on! That's right. Just pass me up like I was some drunken bum on the street. Better move that car before you get a ticket. They'll never take me alive. What happened to you? Tried to score with an orangutan. That's about your speed. - You still hungry? - Mm-mmm. - You cold? - Oh, yeah. This your lunch hour? I'm off today. Don't you have anything better to do with your time off? Not really. I'm kind of a lonely guy, you know? - Poor baby. - It's not that bad. I didn't even know I was lonely till I met you. What's that supposed to mean? I'd go out drinkin', chippyin'... sit at home, watch a ball game with a six-pack. Sounds like a nice life. It was okay. Then all of a sudden I'd just get lonely and start thinking about you. Maybe I'm taking this too serious. I need a nice, hot bath. Bubble bath. I save it for when the kids come to visit. And they all wear pants In the southern part of France There, you look like a Hollywood starlet. Want to take my picture? I'll take your picture. You look like a little kid when you do that. Where you goin'? Home, man. Can't stay here forever. Sure, you can. Then it wouldn't be as much fun. Speak for yourself. Go back to sleep. You're sweet. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. I just have to get back home. I know you like me. I have to leave. - Do you have to get high? - What are you talking about? I saw those track marks on the back of your legs. When you sleep with a cop, you got no secrets. Yeah, man, I wanna get high. I wanna get down right away. Can you dig, baby? You cops are weird, you know. Like you see everything, but you don't know anything. Do you wanna get high? Look, you think I'm a junkie? You think I'm strung out? You see, that's what I mean. You could stay in this neighborhood forever and you'd never understand. I get high once in a while... just like everyone else in the hospital, even the doctors. - Like everyone else in the country. - That's right. Everybody else in the country don't stick needles in their veins. Smack's like a vacation for me. You know? A few hours floating on a raft in the Caribbean. I don't take a vacation every day. I don't need one. In other words, I'm not a junkie, okay? If you want it so bad, let me get it for you. - You? - Yeah. We keep it down at the precinct to give to stoolies. There's tons of it. Let me carry you for a while till you grow out of it. I would think you'd give me a lecture about cleaning up my act or something. See, you could be around cops forever, you'd never understand them. Yeah, well, I know what that kiss means. I'm gonna drive you home. How 'bout we get out of the Bronx some night? - Sounds good. - Go downtown, see a show. - Sure. - Little change of scenery. It stays in your head no matter where you go, though. You know, sometimes I'll be someplace... and I'll turn real fast... and I'll think I see blood all over the walls like in emergency. Or I'll see an old man sitting in a park... and, like, for a second, his mouth just kind of flops open and he's dead. People pass you, and they're laughing... only you think they're screaming. Yeah, some things you can't get out of your mind. You know that kid? You know that kid that was killed the other day? Thrown off a roof. You're not gonna tell me you did it, are you? That's a relief, 'cause we figured it was cops. You did, huh? Just like that? Yeah, people were throwing garbage down on them. This kid wasn't doin' anything. My partner and I were on the next roof. Two guys from our precinct... come in and threw him off. You understand what I'm telling you? I mean, I know who killed that kid. You asking me what to do? I don't know. Just make it easy on yourself'cause it doesn't make any difference anyway. You're never gonna bring that kid back no matter what you do. - If you rat out those two cops... - Rat out, huh? That's what you're talking about, isn't it? If you'd seen my brother throw that kid off a roof, there'd be no problem. You'd arrest him in a second. It's only 'cause they're cops that you got this conscience about it. - Is that wrong? - Let me off. Don't talk like that. Let me off. - You don't live here. - I'll walk the rest of the way. - It's raining. - Let me off! Good-bye, baby. Will I see you again? Sure. Sure, if you want to. That bitch from the hospital, she's with that cop again. Gettin' it on with him, huh? She's gonna lead him right to us. Fuckin' slut. You're just jealous, that's all. Jealous? What would I want with a slut like that? I'm not talkin' about the bitch. I'm talkin' about the cop. He's more your speed, right, Joselito? Come on. Cut that shit out, man. I'm gonna take that bitch off the count. You know, that'll get to you. Why don't you just relax, man? You get too excited. Why don't you let me take care of it, all right? I mean, the man is on the case. What you gonna do? I ain't gonna do nothin', man. You gonna burn her? No, my man. She gonna burn herself. Come here, man. This is the real deal, Neal. This ain't no wack attack. I'm gonna rock her world. I'll make her panties twirl. Straight from the cooker without a chaser. Yeah. This is hers. That is hers. Hey, baby! Come on. Come in from the cold, man. How you been? You okay? What's the matter, man? I got a message from your girlfriend. - She told me to give you this, man. - All right. So, like, what's happening, man? How you been? Okay. Where's your boy Jose? He's havin' a massage. Yeah, yeah, okay. He's not comin' with you? No, man, right now he's got things to do. I got things to do. You mind letting go, bro? I gotta go, man, for real. You take care, right? You'll be okay. - You in love with Jose or somethin'? - You ain't goin' nowhere. Hold it, man. We gotta get his partner. Jose! Jose, it's a bust! Freeze! Hold it! Stay here. Freeze! Put your gun down. Put 'em down or I'll blow his damn brains out! Put your hands on top of your head. Don't make me repeat myself, goddamn it! Jose, get them guns, man. Hold it right there. Move. Right there. Stand still. You, get up! Get up! Get up, goddamn it! The 41 precinct, report of a 10-13. Jefferson Hospital. Repeat, Jefferson Hospital. - It's probably your girlfriend. - Report of a 10-13. - Just can't get enough, can she? - Jefferson Hospital. What's going down? Narcotics blew a bust. Dealers caught on. They took a bunch of doctors, nurses and patients hostage. Nurses? Where are they? They're in the administrator's office on the sixth floor. You get any names? We'll get their names when we get them out. If we get them out. See if she's down here. We'll have to evacuate the hospital. That's impossible. We have patients who aren't ambulatory. - We'll carry them out. - Please. You don't seem to understand. - These men are desperate. - You wanna just let 'em go? Why not? If you know who they are, you could pick them up later. Get him away from me! You made your point. Take it easy. Nurses and attendants, please move all patients... back into their rooms immediately. Stay with them and barricade the doors. Clear the operating room. Suspend all therapy. Get these people outta here! - What's his name? - Hernando. Hernando! Listen. You been around. You know we ain't goin' anywhere. Why don't you let those people go and come on out? What for? Tell me what for. To spend the rest of my life in prison? No! Not me, baby! No! You better come up with a better offer. Everybody's staying here with me. You're gonna come here and get me, and that means... you're going to kill me, and that means they're going to go too. Listen, Lieutenant. If they're in the anteroom, the administrator's office is empty. Maybe we can drop two guys down... come in from behind. Take a chance. - You know the layout? - Sure. - Make a drawing. - Quiet out there, huh? You guys talking it over? You people thinking it over? You don't think I mean business? Come here! Get up! Get over there! Are you guys thinking it over? Shut up, goddamn it! All of you, shut up! Stay still! I'm talking to you! Come on! There's one doctor here who needs a doctor! Next they're gonna need undertakers! - We're gonna have to go in. - We got the hostage squad comin' over. I am not gonna negotiate with him. He's blowin' people away in there. - What do you mean? - The son of a bitch just shot someone. Tell Emergency to lay out their harnesses. Got any suggestions as to who we can dangle? It's my squeal. I'll stick with it. - I'll go with youse. - We have to go up this way. - How many guns they got? - Four for sure. - Yeah? - Look. We're gonna need some time. Two minutes exactly. Then you go in. We'll keep them occupied. Ten-four. - Tell him to put it on the clock. - Put us on the clock. - Now. - Now. Hey, come on. Talk to us. I ain't rappin' to you street pigs. I'm rappin' to your commissioner. He's on his way, so don't blow your cool. Shut up! Everybody, quiet! Quiet! I said quiet, everybody! Get up! Get against the wall! Up against the wall, goddamn it, all of you! Move it! Move your asses against the door! - Come on, move! Move! - Get up against the door, man! Do what he says, bitch! Move! When them cops come in, baby, you'll be the first one to get it. You hear that? He's crazy! He's crazy! Shut your mouth! Shut up! Freeze! Out! Come on. Let's go! Get outta here! Come on! Get these people out. - You okay? - I don't know where she is. Let me through. What's wrong? An overdose. I gotta get her movin'. She's dead. It's over. Come on. Move. Keep movin'. Come on. You can do it. Come on! Come on! Move! Come on. Do it! Oh, honey. Murphy, Murphy. Come on. Give it up, Murph. Come on. Give me a hand. Morning, Murph. How ya doin'? What is it, Murphy? Well, what is it? I'm not a mind reader. You got your stoolie. What does that mean? You have trouble spitting it out? Write it on a piece of paper. Slip it under the door. Morgan and Finley are the guys you want. They threw that kid off the roof. How do you know? I seen 'em do it. I'm a witness. Pantuzzi. Get the Bronx AD A's office on the phone. I want a district attorney and a stenographer here right away. You sure took your sweet-ass time with this news. What's that supposed to mean? Well, what does it look like? Isn't it funny? Being a stoolie is my last official act. You're a good cop. I don't think you'd be good at anything else. I'm gonna run for president. What do you care? I need all the good cops I can get so I can run this precinct the right way. - The right way? - Yeah. The right way. That's by the book, ain't it? You made more waves up here in one month than Dugan did in five years... and did it get you your cop killers? What it got you was a hundred bum arrests... another burned-out building and a dead kid. Jesus, I've been draggin' my ass in and out of this precinct for 14 years. It's too much. I feel as burned-out as those buildings on Charlotte Street. I ain't doin' nobody no good. And you got your nose buried so deep into that book... you don't even see what's going on around here. I'm not proud of what's happened up here, but I can see. I can see the people out there. Not just the hookers, the pimps and the junkies... but those people who are trying to build something up here. And I want them to know who's running this precinct. I want them to know that this precinct isn't a clubhouse with a freak show... but the house of the law and that the law means something... and that it's there to serve 'em. That's the book, Murphy. You got a better way? If we can take the whole neighborhood and bulldoze it into the East River... and you and me with it. Bullshit! You want to quit? Go ahead. I'm not built that way. That's nice, Captain. That's nice. You keep tryin'. I'm quittin'. You don't want this? Save it for the sweeper. - Thanks. - Thank you. You have to go down to the grand jury tomorrow. Yeah, I know. The men will know about it by then. They saw the stenographer comin' in here. They know I'm not dictating my life story. They know. Yeah. Anyway, hold onto this for a while. You can always throw it back in my face. I'm not going anywhere. Freeze! Jesus! I thought it was a hit. You ain't worth killin'. Don't be too sure. I gave Morgan and Finley away. Yeah? So what else is new? I figured you would. - That means they're gonna subpoena you. - I know. - What are you gonna do? - Let me put it this way. I'm not gonna commit perjury to protect those two bastards. - You could say you didn't see nothin'. - And leave you hanging like that? What kind of a creep would I be if I did something like that? You know how I feel about you, man. I'd go up against the goddamn world for you. - We're partners, baby. - Not anymore. - What do you mean? - I'm puttin' in my papers. What? You're gonna leave me alone here in the garden spot of the Western world? Just can't hack it anymore. Look. Look at that. - You gonna let him get away with that? - You betcha. I'm a civilian now. I can look the other way. Yeah, right. Tell me about it.
