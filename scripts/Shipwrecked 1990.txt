Because There Can Only Be One Of You, And It's Gonna Be Me. Take Off Your Uniform. Oh, You'll Look Very Pretty In This Uniform, Merrick, But You'll Not Pass For An Officer In Her Majesty's Navy. You Don't Have The Stuff. [ Groaning, Panting ] You Wait Until My Father Comes Home ! He'll Take Care Of You. Your Father Isn't Coming Home. He's Lost At Sea. [ Boys Laughing ] He Is Not ! He'll Be Home Soon. He Owes My Father So Much Money He'd Be Better Off Lost. Ooh. [ Laughing ] Papa ? Papa ! Papa. I Thought You Were Never Coming Home. My Leg Got Tangled In A Jib Line And, Uh, I Was Knocked Over The Side. Jens Cut Me Free Before I Drowned. Cup Of Coffee For The Road ? [ Child Chattering, Laughing ] Isn't It About Time... You Showed Hakon What You Brought For Him ? Something For Me ? Something I Always Dreamed About When I Was Your Age. You Know What That Is ? It's A Commission From Our Ship. Hakon, You're Gonna Be The New Ship's Boy ! Now You're Ready, Aren't You, Son ? Papa, I-- - I, Uh-- - He Is Too Young. And With That Leg Of Yours We'll Need Him Here. Well, Why Didn't I Think About That ? I Need You Here. I Guess You'll Have To Stay Home. Morning. Is Wernes Here ? Yeah. Wernes ! [ Door Opens ] Ah, Mr. Hakonsen. Heard About Your Accident. It's Too Bad. [ Mr. Hakonsen ] I'm Just Glad I Survived. But They Don't Pay A Man Who's Laid Up In His Bunk, So I'm Afraid I Have To Ask You For A-- To Extend My Loan. How Bad Is Your Leg ? [ Laughs ] It Doesn't Look Like I'll Be Going Back To Sea. Then I Don't See How I Can Extend Your Loan Any Longer. [ Sleigh Bells Tinkling ] Stay Here. Hello, Mr. Hakonsen. Sheriff. Wernes. [ No Audio ] This Is Our Farm Now. You Have To Get Off-- Tomorrow. My Children Were Born Here. My Mother Died Here. Listen-- [ Door Opens ] I'm Paying The Debt. I'm Going To Sea-- To Be Ship's Boy On The Flora. Yes. It Looks Like You Are Going To Sea. Hakon's Gonna Be A Sailor ? [ Laughs ] It's A Deal. Anna, They Have To Go. Hakon, Look. This Was Given To Me By My First Captain. He Said It Would Always Bring Me Home Safe. And It Always Has. It's Yours. Look After Him, Jens. [ Jens ] Like He Was My Own. [ Clicks Tongue ] [ Man Shouting, Indistinct ] [ Men Shouting, Indistinct ] Let Go Gaskets On Fore Mainsail ! [ Man ] Captain Wants You Below, Ship's Boy. [ Man ] Yes ? Hakon Hakonsen, Sir. The New Ship's Boy. Tell Me. Your Father's A Big Man. Why Are You So Puny ? I Don't Know, Sir. I'll Tell You This. There Is No Room For Children On Board This Ship. You Will Work Hard, Be A Sailor, Or I'll Put You Off In London. No, Sir ! You Can't ! I Have To Sail For Two Years. I Can Do Anything I Like On Board This Ship. And Never Talk Back To A Captain. Never. Understood ? Yes, Sir. Good. Go Find The Bosun. He'll Put You To Work. Yes, Sir. Thank You, Sir. [ Chuckling ] Sheet's Fast !

Untie It At Once ! - Untie It, Sir ? Hurry Up, Boy ! Or Are You Trying To Get Us All Killed ? Come On. We'll Hoist You Up. Wait ! We Can't Send Him Up Without A Blindfold. Remember Poor Little Karl, When We Forgot The Blindfold ? He, Uh, He Looked Down. But Jens Didn't Have A Blindfold. He Had His Eyes Closed. You Don't Need A Blindfold When You've Been Doing This... As Long As Jens. My God ! It's Breaking ! Hurry ! Hoist Him Up ! Right, Right ! Get Him Up There. That's It. Get The Blindfold On His Face. One Hand For The Ship, And One Hand For Yourself-- And Don't Look Down ! [ Hakon ] Whoa ! Oh, Help ! Please ! [ Men Laughing ] Yeah ! All Right, That's Enough. Fun's Over. Aw, Just Like You, Jens, To Ruin The Fun. [ Laughs ] I Remember When The Trick Was Played On You, Bosun. But Your Pants Were Too Wet To Fall Down. [ Men Laughing ] Don't Ask Too Many Questions, Hakon. Just Do Your Work... And Keep Your Eyes Open. You'll Find Out Everything You Need To Know. Ugh ! Hey, You Idiot ! A Knot Like This Could Cost A Man His Life. This Is A Knot ! So You Better Pay Attention. [ Bosun ] Clear Those-- [ Continues, Indistinct ] [ Jens ] Watch Out !

[ Men Chattering ] Hakon, Captain Wants To See You. It's A Long Journey... And A Very Hard Passage. Every Man Must Be Fit, Or Nobody Can Be Safe. Captain, Please Don't Put Me Off. My Family's Depending On Me. Come Here. Have You Ever Seen One Of These ? No, Sir. It's Called A Photograph. Look At It. That's Your Father And I. I Want You To Have It. That's All. It'll Remind You Of Home... During The Long Voyage. Aye ? Thank You, Captain. I Mean, Thank You, Sir. I Felt The Same Way When I Was Your Age.

[ Men Groaning ] [ Men Groaning ] - Another Round ? - [ Together ] No ! This Is Mine. [ No Audio ] Guys ? You Can't Fool A Real Sailor. [ Man ] Yeah ! [ Laughs ] Thank You. You're Welcome. The Voyage Ahead Takes Us To Sydney, And Then To Calcutta. That, As You All Know, Is Pirate Territory. The Company Has Signed On A First Mate... Who Knows Those Troubled Waters-- Lieutenant Howell. Mr. Howell... Is One Of The Most Respected Officers... In The British Royal Navy. So, Mr. Howell, I'm Pleased To Have You And Your Bosun Join Us. I Wish You Welcome Aboard. You Are A Fine Body Of Seamen, And I Have No Doubt That You Will... Bring Our Ship To Its Destination As Fast As Nature Allows. Some Of You May Be Concerned About Pirates. Do Not Be. Her Majesty's Navy Has Dispatched These Evil Men... Back To Where They Belong. - That Is All. - Stand By, Fore And Aft ! [ Man ] Let Go Forward ! [ Men Shouting, Indistinct ] [ Shouting Continues ] - Take Down ! - [ Man ] Take Down Buntlines ! Free The Mainsail ! Hey, Ship's Boy ! Don't Stand There Sleeping. Get These Down. [ Indistinct Chatter ] Hurry Up ! Hurry Up ! [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] "Glass." "Howell." You Ought To Be More Careful With The Property Of The Royal Navy, Mister. But We'll Keep This To Ourselves... Because We're Mates. Hmm ? Every Ship Has Her Own Secrets. And Every True Sailor Knows When To Keep His Mouth Shut... For The Sake Of His Ship... And His Mates, Hmm ? I Don't Know Any Secrets. Good Boy. You're Learning Fast. [ Snoring ] [ Whispering ] [ Bosun ] Let Down Fore Topmast ! Give A Bit More. Go On. Go On. [ Sighs ] Captain ? Oh ? You're Still Here ? Yes, Sir. Captain, Are There Rules About-- I Mean-- Spit It Out. What's On Your Mind ? If A Mate Knows Something About Another Mate, Or-Or An Officer-- Kind Of A Secret-- I Mean-- If He Knows That Someone's Got Something On Board... That Maybe They Shouldn't, Should He Report Him Or Not ? Has Someone Smuggled Some Rum On Board ? [ Chuckles ] Don't Worry So Much, Hakon. I Just Want To Be A True Sailor, Sir. I've Never Known A Truer. Now For That Secret Of Yours, Sleep On It. And In The Morning, If You Feel You Should, Come And Tell Me About It, Hmm ? Yes, Sir. Good Night, Sir. Good Night, Hakon. [ Chuckling ] Ay, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi. He Needs Rest, Lad. I Have To Talk To Him. Oh, No. [ Footsteps ] So, How Is The Captain Today ? His Temperature's High. It Is Ship's Fever, Then. Mm. Most Likely, But No One Else Is Sick. I Haven't Seen Ship's Fever Attack Only One Man, Have You ? No, Never. He's An Old Man. [ Man ] We, Therefore, Commit His Body To The Deep, In Sure And Certain Hope... Of Resurrection To Eternal Life... Through Our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen. [ Men ] Amen. [ Splash ] [ Together ] The Lord Is My Shepherd I'll Not Want He Maketh Me Down To Lie In Pastures Green He Leadeth Me The Quiet Waters By Now There Could Be Plenty Of Explanations For This Cargo. - Like What ? - To Use Against Pirates. Then Why Does It Say Glass... When It's Guns ? Now, Listen. Captain Howell Is A British Naval Officer, Hakon. He Is Here To Protect Us. It's Not Our Place To Question How He Does It. Come On. [ Men Chattering ] [ Man ] Clear Hatch Covers For Unloading ! Hello, Hakon. Hmm ? Sydney's The Kind Of Harbor That Leaves A Mark On A Sailor. Really ? Did On Me. [ Bosun ] Rig Those Cargo Blocks ! Go On ! Hmm ? [ Hakon Chuckles ] Easy There ! "Mother." I Have An Announcement From The Captain. We're Behind Schedule. We'll Have To Make Up The Lost Time... On The Passage To Calcutta. All Shore Leave Here In Sydney Is Canceled. Hey, Wait ! That's Not Fair. Mr. Thatcher, We've Been At Sea... For Three-And-A-Half Months ! Sir, We've Been Working Hard. Don't We Deserve Shore Leave ? Gentlemen, Must I Remind You That This Ship Is Under The Command... Of The British Navy ? Insubordination Is A Punishable Offense. Any Questions ? Good. [ All Muttering ] [ Man ] Now What ? Different Captains, Different Styles. Quiet. Bosun, These Are Your New Mates. Show Them To Their Quarters. You Didn't Say Anything About Taking On Extra Crew, Mr. Howell. We Need These Men To Protect Us In Pirate Waters. Carry On. Show Them Their Quarters. This Way. [ Men Snickering ] [ Man #1 ] Secure Those Lines ! [ Man #2 ] Line Secured ! [ Man #3 ] Aye, Aye, Bosun ! Who's Down Here ? Look, Relax ! I'm Not Gonna Hurt You. You're A Girl. Well ? You've Seen One Before, Haven't You ? Yes, But-- What Are You Doing Down Here ? Going To Calcutta, Same As You. Why ? To Get Away From Some Busybodies... Who Want To Put Me In An Orphanage, All Right ? Why Don't You Stay With Your Parents ? They're Dead, If You Must Know. Why Do You Think I'm An Orphan ? I Have An Uncle In Calcutta. That's Why I'm Going There. That's Mine ! You Can Have It If You Keep Quiet. I Can't Read Very Well. I'll Teach You. No. You Don't Have To. I'll Keep Quiet. I'm Hakon. I'm Mary. And I'll Teach You Anyway. "In Xanadu... "Did Kubla Khan... "A Stately... Pleasure Dome Decree." What's Xanadu ? My Mother Said It Was The Most Beautiful Place On Earth. Where Everybody Was Happy... And Safe. But It's Only In A Book. It Doesn't Really Exist. Yes, It Does. [ Clattering ] Huh ! Jens, It's All Right. - She's My Friend. - A Stowaway, Huh ? She's An Orphan. She Has To Get To Her Uncle In Calcutta. [ Jens ] It's Too Late To Tell You Two How Foolish This Is-- And Dangerous. Do You Know What The Penalty Is For Not Reporting A Stowaway ? [ Sighs ] Found These Lying Around. I Thought Hakon Had Smuggled A Dog On Board. [ Clears Throat ] From Now On, You Stick To Your Bunk At Night. And You Lay Low. He Won't Say Anything, Will He ? No. I Trust Him With My Life. [ Gasps ] [ Laughs ] [ Thunderclap ] There Is A Thief Among Us. I Want That Man To Stand Forward And Take His Punishment. [ Moans ] [ Groans ] This Here Is A Stowaway. One Of You Has Been Concealing Her... And Stealing Food For Her. Point Out Your Confederate. You Give Me No Choice. Ow ! Prepare To Keelhaul The Prisoner. She's Only A Child ! Take Her Below. Clap Her In Irons. Aye. Come On ! [ Thunderclap ] So It Was You. You Know The Penalty For Hiding A Stowaway. Give Me The Cat. This Man Will Receive 40 Lashes. No, Wait ! Jens Didn't Do Anything ! It Was Me. Hakon ! [ Hakon Groans ] [ Grunts ] The Cat Will Kill Him. [ Jens Grunts ] Sir, You Can't Do This. [ Thunderclap ] You Will Do It. Pick Up The Cat. Pick Up The Cat !

Take On The Whole Village By Yourself ? Jens ! They're Peaceful, Friendly. They Saved Our Lives. They Plucked Us Out Of The Ocean, And We've Been Traveling From Island To Island With Them, Trying To Find You. But Mary Was Fighting With Them. Those Boys. They Claim Me As Their Sister, And Now They Expect Me To Clean Up After Them. Well, They Can Forget It. She Fights With Them Every Night. I Almost Gave Up Hope Of Ever Finding You Again, But Mary Never Did. [ Jens Sighs ] Well-- I, Um, Better Go Tell The Chief We're Leaving. Hakon, It's Beautiful. I Thought I'd Never See You Again. I Thought I'd Never See Anybody Again. [ Native Language ] [ Native Language ] Stop ! What's The Matter ? One Of My Traps. For What ? Merrick Will Be Back For His Treasure One Day. See Up There ? [ Jens ] Looks Like Ropes And Pulleys. You Step On That Vine, And You'll Be Swinging From The Top Of That Tree. Come On. Jump Over It. [ Footsteps Approaching ] He's Really Put Together Quite A Place Here. A Real Xanadu, Fit For A King. [ Chuckles ] I Felt Like A King. I Really Did. But It Wasn't Quite Like Home. No. We Better Go To Sleep. Good Night. Good Night. Good Night. Don't Touch The Vines ! Right. I Can't Believe You Ever Got Out Of There Alive The First Time. I Nearly Didn't. - Poor Merrick. - Yes, He's Really In For Trouble. Careful. Hmph. [ Waves Lapping ] [ Gasps ] [ Jens ] Pirates. We Have To Get Out Of Sight. It's Howell. Merrick.

I've Got An Idea. This Is So Stupid. I'm The One Who Should Go. Hakon Knows The Island Best, And, Jens, You Know Everything Else. No ! It's Too Dangerous. I Sneaked On Board Your Ship When You Were Standing Guard. I Believe Her. Have You Ever Used A Gun Before ? [ Lid Opens, Closes ] [ Clicks ] I Think I Can Handle Myself. Now, Get The Treasure Safe Aboard. But Wait For Our Signal, Then Carry Out The Plan. What If You're Captured ? That's Not Gonna Happen. But If It Does, You Sail On Without Us. Take My Share Of The Treasure To My Family. What Are You Looking At ? Thought I Heard Something. Probably Just A Fish. [ Boat Creaking ] [ Gasps ] Shh ! You've Got To Help Me Take Over The Ship.
