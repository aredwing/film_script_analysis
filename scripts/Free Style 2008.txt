Dude, where the hell have you been? Come on, come on. We gotta go. Let's hurry. Let's hurry. Where you think I've been? Come on! We're... running out of time. How much time do I got? They're at the gates. [Exhales] [Engines Revving] - Cuttin' it close, man. - Wasn't gonna let you off that easy. To the flag. To the flag. You guys make me wanna barf. [Revving] [Announcer] There they go! Let's get it on, folks! - [Grunting] - [Man Rapping] [Announcer, Indistinct] Maynard and Bryant are leading, with Black pressing. Throttle down! Come on! [Announcer] Oh! Maynard jumps out in front. Red 62, with Bryant pressing second. Bryant in the traditional blue and whites, number 71. Derek Black in yellow, number 37, and third so far. [Continues, Indistinct] My style is di bom digi bom di deng di deng digidigi  [Vocalizing] [Continues] [Announcer, Indistinct] It's Maynard, Bryant, Black. Fans, this is a three-man race, with Maynard in the lead, Bryant and Black right on his tail. [Continues] Let's go, buddy!

He has pulled out of the race to look after his friend. Derek Black takes the checkered flag and 100 points! - [Cheering] - Medic team to the track. Medics to the track, please. Justin. Hey. Justin! [Exhales] Justin! Can you hear me? Somebody get some help over here! [Groans] Hey! Hey! - You all right, dude? - I think I'm-- I think I'm dying. What? No, dude, listen to me. You're fine. Hang on. - I-I see a bright light. - Justin-- Stay with me, man. Wake up. Come on. It's being blocked out by-- by a giant Brillo pad. - [Laughs] - You had better be dying, or I'll kill you myself. [Grunts] What happened? That happened. [Announcer] This is the last call-- Is Justin okay? Yeah, Justin's fine. So you don't get any points today? Nope. Sorry. Well, crap! Hey! Where'd you learn that? School. Haley says it all the time. Here, I'll take it, man. Thanks, man. Hey. Well, that was really brave. And stupid. Come on, Mommy. Look, I know why you did it. You could've really gotten hurt, okay? Here. - Did you see Crystal? - We called and waited, but we didn't want to miss the race. She totally flaked on you, Cale. I'd dump her. Hey. Hey. Would you explain to me why you were 50 yards from second place... in a very important qualifying match and quit? Did you see Justin crash? I thought he was dead. Yeah? You think he's gonna reimburse you the 500 bucks or the 50 points... you lost going back for him? Look, Cale, I know you really need the money, man. And we sure as hell need the points. Friendship does not have a place on the racetrack. You got it? I don't do this for my health. This is my business, and I provide a bike for you to do one thing-- win. That's it. And I have. Not recently, and not enough for you to be throwing away points. You pull another stunt like this, Cale, and we're through. You got it? Miss Bryant. Good afternoon. - What a fart-face. - Bailey! [Rock] What? [Continues] We're growing up and getting by  Scared we might not make it out alive  The clock is running out but there's still time  Your life is on the line  It's either sink or swim You lose or win  No giving up or giving in to them  Sing while you can  And don't pretend the future's in their hands  So make a point Stop pointing fingers now  Sing while you can  - 'Cause this could be the best years that you have  - [Blusters] [Laughs] Our words are weapons  Pull the trigger now  [Fades] Hi. Hello, Bud. What do we have today? We have blackberry crumble. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Nice work. Well, if I'd made it, I'd take the compliment. Presentation is everything. Don't sell yourself short. Hmm. Nice line. That's cute. Sing while you can  - And don't pretend the future's in their hands  - I'm buyin' you a watch. Hey, Jeannette. Hi, Crystal. Hey. Are they here? [Singing, Indistinct] Hey. Did you bring it? Sing while you can 'cause this could be  You want some overtime, Cale? I've got a few hours for you. I've got to put in a pizza shift tonight. If you want to make assistant manager-- I know. I gotta put in the time. Sing while you can  And don't pretend the future's in their hands  So make a point Stop pointing fingers now  Sing while you can  Your tally was a little light yesterday. Uh, I'll make it up on my next win. - You said that last time. - Pull the trigger now  Hey. Hey. Thought I'd catch a ride. All right. Why'd I get so lucky? [Chuckles] Missed you at the track the other day. I told you. I had to study. Wanna come over tonight? Still gotta study. Come on. Don't you ever give it a break? Hey, I'm just thinking about my future. What, you think I don't? That's not what I said. It's a big year for me. A few more in the top three, I can get a sponsorship. A real one. Yeah, but what if you don't make it? I don't know. Haven't thought about it. It just seems like you should have some sort of backup plan. [Engine Starts] You ever think about getting a car like a normal guy? [Chuckles] You wouldn't like me if I was a normal guy. Cale, Braden always teases me. What, that kid in the class with the big teeth? Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. He says I look different. Oh. That's just 'cause you're special. He calls me names. Hey, don't let it get to you. Cale, are we white or black? We're, uh-- We're "whack." [Thunder Rumbling] [Announcer] Sorry, folks. There will be no racing today. The track is completely washed out. But we'll see you here next week, same time, same place, weather permitting, at the Riverwood Invitational. What to do with not really having the right travel partners and stuff, but I really want to go and have, like, a real Italian experience. Cale. Cale. Yes. Ready? One, two, three, go. Oh! All right. Lunch is on me today. It's fine. It's fine. Rancho Bonita. [Boy] Mexican. No. No? Come on. Go now? Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Come on with us. I'm good. I'm good. Go. All right. All right. I'll see you later. Bye. [Justin] Listen. The top motocross racers are making like six figures a year. [Boy] Wow. That'd be cool. Not to mention sponsorships. That could be you. The fajitas! Mmm, the fajitas! All right, look at this guy. Look at this guy, man. That's how you do it. I took air like that yesterday. See this bike, man? You can build that? You were flat on the ground. My Uncle Bill once-- he ate 29 bean burritos here. No way. - Yeah. - Too bad he's not here, 'cause my truck's out of gas. [Laughs] Dudes, I am starving. What do you eat in this place? The chimi-- ch-ch-- chimichoongo-- Chimichangas. Chimichangas, man. Chimi-wangos. Hi. What can I get you today? Uh, uh, yeah. I'll have the-- [Spanish Accent] the Macha Burrito Combo and a large el cola. Would you like a better accent to go with that? Wow. Okay. Ooh. Anything else? Uh, yeah. I'll get the, uh-- the ch-- chimi-- uh-- Chimichangas. Yes. The Cheech-and-Chongos sound delicious. - [Laughter] - I'll take two tacos, and a large chocolate milk. Somebody's feeling lucky today. - Yeah. - Hey. Your mom's birthday, right? Oh, yeah. Can't fight tradition. Okay, I'll be right back. "Feeling lucky"? How about getting lucky, as in me and that senorita? [Laughs] In your dreams, man. Damn right. - Dude. - Bro, one day we are gonna be all over this magazine. I mean, look at this. Thirty-seven lottery tickets here. Thank you. Chips and salsa. Hey, uh, Ale-jan-- - Alej-- - Alejandra. - Alejandra. - Alejandra, right. Who do you think is better looking, me or him? - Hmm. - Huh? - I'd rather not say. - Yeah? Why's that? - Don't wanna blow my tip. - Ooh! - [Imitates Explosion] - [Laughter] - That's just mean. - The J-train's derailed. Yeah, well, at least I'm trying, boys, okay? You lost your touch, man. Come on. We're here at Holeshot talking with local motocross champion Derek Black. What's goin' on? The world's coming to an end. Derek, Sports Illustrated recently ranked motocross... as the most physically demanding sport in the world. How do you prepare for a race like this week's qualifier? Well, being in shape matters, Kelly, but a lot of racing is mental. Yeah. You're mental, Black. [Laughs] And how do you feel about the latest announcement from the pro tour? - Sorry? - Well, after the crash last week of Danny Camden, there's one opening on the U.S. pro tour. Whoever does the best on the amateur tour this year will get that spot. Dude, the pros. Yeah, the pros. A real shot at the pros doesn't just happen. [Chuckles] Guys, and the regionals are on our turf this year. We just gotta kill at the regionals, and we're on to the nationals. Yeah, dude, we gotta beat one guy-- Derek. Two if you count his dad. Guys, guys. "We" ain't "we." There's only one spot. One. - 'Cause I know there's  - [Laughing] Got to be another level  [Shouting, Indistinct] Somewhere closer to the other side  And I'm feeling like it's now or never  Can I break the spell  Of the typical  The typical  Typical Uh-huh  [Fades] Can you believe this, man? We got a real shot at the pros. I thought your dad was paying for you to go to college. I convinced him to give me one more shot. If I don't make it though, Boston, here I come. Yeah, well, you should go. Yeah? Yeah. Hey, if I could go to college-- You would, yeah. You're not getting off that easy, my friend. No, but I'm serious, man. I mean, this is-- This is the chance for me here. You know? It's a real chance. Bro, we've been dreaming about the pros since we were little kids. Are you ready for this? To the flag. To the flag. Hey. Thanks for coming back for me last weekend. All right? I know John was pissed. Just... don't ever do that again. Happy birthday, Mommy! [Gasps, Laughs] [Laughs] Make a wish. Oh, I already have everything I need. [Patting Back] All right, I could use a few things. Do you want to help me? Yeah! Do you have your wish? Yeah. Okay. [Inhales] - [Blowing] - Yea! All right. Let's get started. Quarter for you. And you. [Coin Scratching] Now don't go praying over lottery tickets. That's not right. [Both Laughing] And scratch! That's a dudder. So what you gonna buy, Mommy? Let's see. I would pay off all my bills... and my student loan. And I would put the rest in savings. [Scratching] All right. I'll take you guys to Tahiti. We'll buy an island, and we'll hunt down George Clooney. - Cool! [Laughs] - All right. - All right, come on! Let's win! Let's win! - [Groans] - Crys? - Hey. I got a race this weekend. You wanna come by? [Sighs] Cale, I can't. I have to study. You, um-- You can't even come out for just like two hours or something? Cale, this exam is really important to me. Please. Okay.

Roger "the Rocket" Torres, number 24, came in first-- [Continues, Indistinct] [Chattering] [Indistinct Conversation] See those ruts? I saw 'em. Yeah, they're like the Grand Canyon. Hit 'em hard, okay? Don't get stuck in those. You get stuck, you're dead. Yeah. You all right? Yeah. Yeah. I just-- I thought my dad might be here. He said he'd try.

You got it, partner. - [Boy] Hey, where's Cale goin'? - Now where were we? Six hot ones coming up. Cale? Yeah. You workin' here or what? Come on. Come on! Let's go! Don't be late this time! [Stereo: Rock] [Girl Laughing] - Yeah! - [Laughing] Yeah? [Laughs] Crystal? Crystal, hey. Hey! Havin' a good time? Yeah? Look at you. You-- You-- You-- All right. All right. [Stereo: Rock] Hey, Trent, where's Crystal? I don't know, man. She was just here. Do you know where Justin is? I think they were headed to the lookout. [Rock] What the hell are you-- Dude, what are you doin'? Get out of here! [Laughter] [Boy Chattering] - Crystal! - Cale! Get out of there! Get the hell out of there! [Handle Clicking] Open the car! What the hell is your problem? Cale, please-- Shut up, Crystal! You studying again tonight?

Hey-- What are you gonna do? - Get off me! - Cops! Cops! Get out of here! - Derek, get in the car! - What are you doing? What's wrong with you? - This has nothing to do with you! - [Revving] Take me home now. Right. Now! Yeah, I'll call you. Don't bother. How long? Just tonight, I swear. God. Crystal, did it have to be with Derek? Is that really what you're angry about? 'Cause it was Derek? What has happened to you? Wh-What's happened to us? You deliver pizza. Okay? You work at Electronic Factor, Cale. You're just drifting along, expecting something to happen, and it never does. That's not true. I got a shot at the pros. Yeah, a shot. That's all it is. What if it doesn't happen? What are you gonna do, huh? What do you want? Do you want me to be like Derek... with his expensive cars? You want Justin, going off to college? Would that make you happy? You know what? Forget it. I'm never gonna be good enough for you. [Engine Starts] [Siren Wailing] Don't be stupid, Cale. Shut it down. I don't care what anybody says. My son is not a vandal, and he's not spending any time in jail. Jeannette, if you'd just-- No. People see a boy like him on a bike, and they immediately think he's a criminal! Mom! Mom! I did everything they said I did. I should be in jail right now. There's been some property damage. That's all. Officer Williams vouched for me. We should thank him, okay? Well, thank you. Uh, you should know that it's going to be 500 in damages... plus a hundred bucks for the speeding ticket. I couldn't knock it any lower. Well, I-- I appreciate you telling me. Sure. I'm sorry that I reacted that way. I just get a little protective sometimes. Sometimes? Is there something you're trying to tell me, Bud Williams? No, ma'am. Good night, Jeannette. Good night. What in the world were you thinking? Nothing. I was thinking nothing. Cale Bryant. What? What, I'm not allowed to get angry? Mom, I work two jobs and I bust my ass at both of them. And it's still not enough. It never will be. What do you mean? You know how grateful I am for-- No, Mom. It's not you. It's-- It's everybody else. Derek and Crystal. Even Justin sometimes. If Dad had just stayed. Where did that come from? I don't know. I-I don't know anything. I just-- [Sighs] I think-- I think that things might have been different. That's all. I met your father... right when I graduated from high school. He was the most beautiful man I'd ever seen. Your father had dreams of getting out of here. Big dreams. Having a wife and a baby made that hard. So when we had your sister, he left us. Yeah, I know that part. You don't always get to be what you want to be when you grow up, Cale. Your father ran away from who he was. From us. Never heard from him again. You've been chasing this motorcycle dream for a long time. I know-- I know it means a lot to you, but-- but maybe it's time that you started getting serious about your future. Mom, racing is my future. Cale, seriously-- What-- What am I supposed to do? I don't know anything else. You know, I got news for you. We're never gonna win the lottery. Cale-- [Exhales] [Door Slams] Are you okay? John. John, what's goin' on? Hey! What are you doin'? I heard about the stunt you pulled... - at the lookout last night. - That has nothing to do with racing. - It has to do with who you are as a person. - You can't take my bike, John! Last time I checked, I own this cycle. I have done everything you've ever asked me to do. Don't do this. I wish I felt like I could count on you, Cale. But I just don't. How am I supposed to race? Huh? That's not my problem. Find yourself another bike. [Rock] Prison gates won't open up for me  On these hands and knees I'm crawling  [Announcer] There they go! I reach for you  [Announcer Continues, Indistinct] Well, I'm terrified of these four walls  These iron bars can't hold my soul in  All I need is you  Come, please I'm calling  And all I scream for you  Hurry, I'm fallin' I'm fallin'  Show me what it's like  To be the last one standing  And teach me wrong from right  And I'll show you what I can be  And say it for me Say it to me  And I'll leave this life behind me  Say it if it's worth saving me  Hello? Hello. Can I help ya? Yeah. What's the deal with this bike? That old Excalibur? Yeah. What do you wanna know? I-- It looks pretty beat up. Yeah. Yeah. It's seen better days. - Does it still work? - Did once. Um, why don't I just take this piece of junk off your hands. [Scoffs] Gotta be worth something, don't you think? - How much? - I don't know. What do you think? [Cale Sighs] It's-It's hard to tell. [Horse Whinnies] How about a month of me pitching in around here? - In the mornings. - I look like I need help, do I? Look, I really want the bike. What the hell. [Rock] There's a splinter in my hand  But I'm not complaining  Just by nudging my shoulder  Yeah, I know what you're thinking  We're coming up empty  Yeah, we know what to do now Let's ride  You and me in sidecar one  All right. See you later, okay? All right. That's cool? Bye. Love you. Bye. Oh. Hey, Bailey-- 'Cause it's almost gone now  Wait a minute. Make your bike look good. On the house. Wally, thank you. I'm good as gold now  The timing's so perfect  The time keeps on moving  And ours is almost up  [Whinnying] Use your sleight of hand now  Yeah, you're gone when the smoke clears  [Blusters] And now I miss you and me in sidecar one  Our course is set for a collision  For now I blame this on  Let's go. How was your day? The night 'cause it's almost gone now  The night is almost gone, yeah  The night is going wrong yeah  The night is almost gone yeah  The night is gone  Forever  Hey. It's the lottery ticket guy. Rancho Bonita? [Chuckles] Everyone around here calls me Alex. Alex, what are you doing here? I help out in exchange for riding time. What about you? Pretty much the same. You ride? Well, I ride a different animal. I race motocross. At least I used to. [Chuckles] You know, I still do, but just... not lately. - I'm gonna be a pro. - [Horse Nickers] Okay. Pro. Nice to see you again. [Horse Whinnies] Where you headed? To work. Need a lift? [Rain Pattering] Yeah. [Chuckles] I'm Cale, by the way. So what happened to your crazy friend? Oh. Justin. He's, uh, training. I was actually supposed to go, too, but it didn't work out. I guess for the better. Maybe. [Engine Starts] Alejandra? Hey! Papi. Do I know this boy? No, Papi. I don't like him. You don't like any boys around me. I hear your boy Cale lost his bike. Just you and me, bro. Not much of a challenge. I'm not your bro, all right? And you hooking up with Crystal was so not cool. Oh, she knew what she was doing. Yeah, did she? Mm-hmm. Anyway, jealousy will get you nowhere. [Chuckling] Actually, I was just trying to get her out of there. I don't know why. Anyhoo, all's fair in love and motocross. Did you come up with that by yourself, or did your dad help you with that? Just a little bit. Yeah. Hey! What's up, man? I haven't seen you in a while, man. Yeah, been around. Busy. Yeah? Rebuilding a bike. Yeah, I heard. I heard. It's too bad my sponsor couldn't help you out. It all comes easy for you. What? You know, it all falls in your lap. With college, girls, sponsors. You don't have to work that hard for it, you know? Is that-- That's what you think? Yeah? Because I bust my ass every day, Cale. We bust our asses every day, and that's why we're sponsored and you're not. Okay? I race on the edge, and you play it safe. You got so much going on in your head, you don't even think. Dude, where is this coming from? I thought we were on the same team. What team, Cale? When are you gonna get it? Motocross is not a team sport. If I was the one who took the fall the other day, you wouldn't have gone back for me? Yeah, you're damn right. Wow. Okay. I get it. Aw, did you two break up? Hey! Hey, what's going on? Take it outside, guys! Take it outside! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on! All right, all right! It's done, it's done! It's over! Out! You too, Trent! - What? I didn't do anything! - They're your friends. You're fired. Oh! Fine! Here you go. So how's Cale? [Sighs] Seems more agitated than usual. I heard about his bike deal. He'll get through. He's a tough kid. Thanks for asking. Well, you sure look pretty today. Thanks, Bud. You know, we've been doing this dance for a long time now. [Chuckles] I've got two kids who are obviously a handful. I work this job, go to school part-time. [Sighs] You don't want to get involved with that. Don't be so sure. Damn it. Maybe it needs gas. So if I get enough points, I can still qualify for Nationals, and one of the pros just dropped out of the pro tour, and whoever wins this year gets that spot. Wow. You have big dreams. Yeah. Don't you? Uh, I guess I'm already living my dream. I wasn't born here, but... I love it here. [Scoffs] Is that funny? I-- I never thought of this place that way. You know, all I've ever wanted to do is get out of here. I really hope you get what you're searching for. Thanks. - Wow. That looks powerful. - Yeah, it is. Can't wait to take it on the track, go freestyle. What does that mean, "freestyle"? It's when you're riding for fun. You know, you're not racing. It's-- It's when you're just hanging in the air, and you're looking down on the world, and life is good. It only lasts for a few seconds, but it's almost as if time just stops... and no worries, you know, no one can touch you. Will you show me motocross? So this is the starting gate, and here you line up with about to just psych each other out. It's pretty crazy. And then, uh, the 30-second board goes up. Your heart is thumping, and... it feels like it's going to pump right out of your chest. And then you stare down at the gate. It feels like forever waiting for it to drop. But by that point, I mean, I just-- I just block everything else out, just focus on that win. But, uh, here, uh, step on that. - [Motors Roaring] - [Laughing] When that happens, everybody here, they just explode out of here, and they all try to be the very first one to that first turn right over there. That's called the holeshot. It looks scary. [Chuckles] Yeah, well, it's-- it's probably the most dangerous part. I mean, there's dirt and rocks flying up at you everywhere, and there's just guys crashing all over the place. But if you get the holeshot, you're in the lead. You set the pace of the race. Everybody else just plays catch-up. So if you get the holeshot, you win? Nah, it's just the beginning. See that over there? That deep rut? Oh, you want to avoid that. Yes and no. See, it can snap your bike, or your leg. Oh! But you know, if you can tackle it, if you can just own it, then you can fire out of there like a rocket. It can make or break a race. That's sort of where my problem is. But the deeper the rut you get in-- The faster you shoot out. It's very exciting. I mean, the way you tell it. It wasn't what I expected. Yeah, me neither. It gets really intense. They're rough. I mean, imagine having a bunch of bikes driving right next to you, slamming into you. Oh, my God. You're crazy. You know what? You've just got to come to a race. [Chattering In Spanish] [Spanish] Alejandra. Papi. Hija. Tell me about him. I want to like this one. Even more so, I want you to like this one. Looks dumb-ass. Hey. Pirate. Bails, you're not helping. You can always shave your head. You're really not helping me. Try being yourself. [Clicks Tongue] [Chuckling] [Motor Off] Wow. [Man Singing In Spanish, Faint] Hey. [Mutters] You must be Cale. Yes. Hi, Mrs. Lopez. Please, call me Carmen. Okay. Now, you wait right here, and I will get Alejandra. Okay. Great. Good evening. Hi. I am Angel Lopez. Oh, nice to meet you. Alejandra has told me how hard you work to provide for your family. I try. And you will own this pizza store one day? No, I-- I race motocross. I-- I have seen, and it is dangerous, right? Yeah, sometimes people get hurt, but-- Badly. [Speaking Spanish] Hey! Hey. I'm so glad you came. Um, have you met my family yet? Yeah. Yeah, we met. Good. Oh, come on. I'm gonna show you the house. Okay. [Man Singing In Spanish Continues] [Exhales] [Chattering] Oh, don't be scared of my dad. He's just a little protective of his daughter. He seems to have done very well for himself. He worked his way up from a cook... to the owner of the first Rancho Bonita. The proudest day of his life was when he became a U.S. citizen. He worked nine years... before he could send for us. I was four when he left. Wow. Oh, come on. You'll have to forgive me. I've never danced to this kind of music before. This is easy. Okay, let me teach you how to dance the Banda. [Bells Jingle] [Engine Starts] - Hey. Who's your boyfriend? - Aren't you gonna kiss him? Don't you come back, or I'll tell Papi what I found under your beds. Sorry. So, what did you find under their beds? You don't want to know. [Chuckling] [Horn Honks] - [Honking Continues] - [Gasping] [Crashing] [Sustained Horn Honking] [Chattering] There's a lady in there! Are you okay? You all right? [Woman On P.A.] Dr. Ford, telephone call, line one. Dr. Ford, line one. [Woman] How's that? [Man] A bit better. Mr. Bryant? Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Miles. [Woman On P.A.] Dr. Shannon, report to X-Ray. Dr. Shannon, report to X-Ray. - Can we talk to her? - Oh, go right ahead. She might be a little groggy. Okay. Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom? Mom. [Quiet Groan] Hey. Hi. Hi. Hi, sweetheart. Are you okay? Yeah. [Chuckles] Mama's gonna be fine. [Bailey] Good. Mr. Bryant, can I talk to you? Hey. Come here, sweetie. Sit up here. First of all, your mother's gonna be fine. I'd just like to keep her overnight just to be safe. Do you get to go home tonight? I hope so. You know your insurance isn't gonna pay for all this. You should talk to the administrator before you leave. [Bailey] With the extra bedding? I know you like that one. I hope so. Thanks. We'll take her home tonight. [Bailey Chattering] Mommy's gonna be okay, right? Hey. Mommy's gonna be fine. Okay? We just-- We just have to be quiet. She's gonna have a headache for a few days. Like, we'll make a game out of it. Okay. Okay. I love you, Cale. I love you too. Everything's gonna be okay. You'll never leave us, right? Hey. Hey, no. Never. Okay? You've done a good job, Cale. It's not really race-worthy though. I can't give you much. I know. I-- I needed a few more things to keep working on it. You sure about this? Just... tell me how much you can give me for it. Hey. Hey. I-I heard about your mom. I'm really sorry. She's gonna be fine. She just is gonna be laid up for a bit. You didn't have to come down here. You could have just called. I wanted to see you. Cale. I'm really sorry. But, Crys-- Alex. Alex! Alex, this is-- [Sighs] I-- I didn't know. I-- Sorry. Hey, guys. No pizza boy today? Where the hell are you, bro? Cale, honey? Mom? Mom, what is this? You said you never heard from Dad again. I didn't. He sent a letter. And-- And money. The check would have bounced, Cale. How do you know that? Mom, that's $1,500! I-- I just sold my new bike to pay your medical. I should have gotten rid of this years ago. You said he didn't care about us. I would rather starve than take money from a man who left his family. Great, Mom, but your children are right there starving with you. You grew up strong and good, Cale. Mom, you knew where he was. You don't need a father like that. How-- How do you know what I needed? Mom, you made me the man of the house when I was 10 years old. I mean, I-- I was working two jobs when I was 15! I-- I see my friends, I-- I see their lives, and you-- you robbed me. Cale, honey. No. [Door Slams] [Motorcycle Revving] [Motorcycles Revving] Justin! [Grunts, Groans] [Saw Whirring] Can I help you? I thought you were taller. But then I was just a little kid. - Oh, God. Cale? - Hey. How'd you find me? One of your neighbors told me where you work. What are you doing here? Well-- I was-- I remember coming home and wondering why there was so much stuff in the car. Hey, you told me that you'd be right back. You were just gonna go for a drive to cool off after another fight with Mom. [Sighs] Do you remember that Tuesday, Dad? It was 3:00, Dad. I-- I-- Every day-- Your-- I was waiting for-- Your mother and I had some problems. It wasn't a good situation, Cale. It wasn't a good situation for who? For you or for us? No, for all of us. I couldn't stay, Cale. Look, I never stopped loving my family, but, you know, things happen, people change. Your mother just wouldn't-- This isn't about Mom. This is about you and me. Look, your mother didn't need me. You didn't need me. How could you say that? You didn't even know me. How do you know what I needed? Okay. Okay. What do you want? I can't change things that happened. Why are you here now? I tried to forget you. I-- Mom was great, but when I needed someone-- Wh-When I really needed to reach out to someone, you weren't there. Things have been piling up back home... with Mom and my work and everything, and I thought that... mayb-- I thought maybe once I'd get the right lottery ticket. I-- Okay, okay. I get it. You do? Look, here's, uh-- I don't know. Here's some money. Will this do it for you? Well, this is what it's about, right? This is a shakedown. Oh, my God. You really don't get it at all, do you? What? You never did. Hey. You're a pretty good-looking kid, man. You remind me of me when I was a kid. We're nothing alike. [Train Horn Blowing] [Dog Barking] Love you, Mom. Oh. I'm so sorry. I thought I was protecting you. I shouldn't have lied. No, Mom, you were right. Dad disappeared a long time ago. I love you, sweetheart. I love you too. [Groans] Can't a girl get some sleep around here? Alex. I have nothing to say. Look, I-- I know. Listen to me, okay? Alex, will you just-- Will you hear me out, please? Whatever you saw the other day at the store was not exactly what it looked like. All right. Crystal's my ex, and it's over between us, all right? It's-- It's in the past. Now, I've been through a lot lately, all right? And a lot of things have changed, and a lot of that change is 'cause of you. I don't know what it-- exactly this is between us, but when I'm with you, I feel good. Hey. I think that you maybe felt the same way too. I just want to give this another shot. Please. I like you, Cale. You're a nice guy, and I'm not sure if this is gonna work. But... we can try. Okay. [Sighs] I heard. I'm done, bro. I lost my sponsorship. They dropped me faster than a pregnant prom queen. Uh, my dad won, I guess. I got Boston coeds in my future now. It's not so bad though, right? I mean, I probably would have got bored on the pro tour anyways. Who said you were gonna beat me? [Both Laughing] Listen, man. I'm sorry about all that stuff that I said, you know? Me too, man. I'm sorry. So, it's up to you now, bro. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna turn in my application as assistant manager over at Electronic Factor. What? What are you-- What about the dream? I missed the race the other day, man. It's over. Yeah? Well, you always got the regionals. I obviously can't race next weekend, and since you tied Derek for second, you got my spot, bro. What? Yeah. You're racing next weekend in the amateur regionals. Yeah. Oh, my God! Oh, hey. Easy, okay? Easy. Okay. Sorry. Now all you need, man, is an entrance fee and a bike. Well-- Ah, well, don't look at me, bro. You think I look bad, you should see my bike. No ride, no bike. That's how endorsements work. Hey, tell me Trent got his job back at Holeshot. Yeah, he did. I've never seen a man beg so much in my life. He was on his knees, crying, snot coming out of his nose. It was gross. Okay, you don't understand. Wally, Wally, Wally. Have we ever let you down? We're not gonna need it for that long. I'll do it on my own time, I promise. You don't have to pay me. - Once he works on it, it's gonna be better-- - All right. - Wally. - Absolutely free. Seriously. - All right. All right! Now back to work. - Yeah! Dude. Wally. Yes! Thank you. Thank you. [Man] We don't have time left to regret  - Come on. - Hold on  It will take more than common sense  Take this. Got it? That's it. Come on. So stop your wondering Take a stand  Hold on  'Cause there's more to life than just to live  Hold on  'Cause an empty room can be so loud  There's too many tears to drown them out  So hold on, hold on  Hold on, hold on  One single smile a helping hand  Ma'am, it's 13.25! It's not that hard to be a friend  Please? Hold on  Thank you. So don't give up Stand till the end  Hold on  'Cause there's more to life than just to live  Hold on  'Cause an empty room can be so loud  There's too many tears to drown them out  So hold on, hold on  Come on, Cale, buddy. Pick up the pace. You want be a champ? Hold on, hold on  Not bad. Yeah. I was wondering if you wanted to come over... and watch the race with me and Bailey. Just hold on, hold on  Are you serious? Hold on, hold on  Great. Okay. I'll see you then. [Beeps] Hold on  'Cause an empty room can be so loud  There's too many tears to drown them out  So hold on  [Trent] That about does it. I bored and honed the cylinders, added a set of hot cams, recut the valve seats, and, uh, oh, yeah-- I modified the accelerator pump. God, you make me hot. Get your arms off me before I chew them off. Hold on, hold on  How are we doing for finances? Uh, Secretary of the Treasury? We've got $937. Guys, we need two grand for entrance fee. Yeah. Damn it. I've got an idea. It'll be on magazines. It'll be on TV. There's hundreds of people there. It's the regional championships, and it's-- it's here. It's never here, and people will see-- - Yeah, yeah. It's a sport, a game, uh-huh? - I don't know about this. No, Senor Lopez, it's not just a game. It's-It's my life, and you can make money at it. You can make a living. Senor Lopez, you came to this country... with a dream, and you-- you worked hard, and you sacrificed everything, and now look what you have. This is my dream. This is what I do well. If I could have half of what you have-- a business, a family-- Mr. Lopez. Your daughter is, um-- Your daughter's quite extraordinary, and I-- I look at you, and I see why. - [Squeals] - Yeah! [Justin] Yes! Attaboy! Right on, man. Great. Thank you, Mr. Lopez. Thank you. Thanks to Rancho Bonita and myself, your ride's now officially pimped. Dude, your bike's making me hungry. It's all right. [Alex] Yeah, it's good. [Cale Thinking] God, I'm, uh, freaking out a little bit here. Look, I know that sometimes I question whether you're even there or not, but I figure lately... that you have to be there in order for me to be here. I just want to ask you to help me do my best today... and, if possible, could you smooth out the track? Amen. Hey. Yeah, I'm all right. I'm just, uh, mapping out the track. You're gonna be amazing. Thank you. I'm a little nervous. [Jeannette Laughing] Come on, Cale! Come on. Hurry, hurry! The final's about to start. [Announcer] How do you do, ladies and gentlemen? And good afternoon. Today is a huge race, with so much at stake. Keep an eye on the starter, okay? Watch his body language. As soon as he hits the pin, the holeshot's yours. Derek looks strong, Shawn Nash is tearin' it up, so you gotta get out front early this time, okay? Now, the track is totally rutted. It's treacherous. You gotta be strategic. Keep your low foot in front of you. Sit on it, your high side'll be fine, okay? All right, got it. Yeah? What did I just say? Not a clue. Why am I here? Why-- Uh, free food? - Sympathy? - The chicks. - The chicks. - Yeah, the chicks, the chicks. Seriously, don't worry. I just gotta focus on the ruts. If I get that, I win. Yeah, and if you don't-- [Imitates Bomb Falling, Explosion] Yeah. [Clears Throat] Come here. To the flag. To the flag. All right. [Announcer] This track has suffered a lot of rain this week. Still very wet, with a lot of deep ruts the boys will have to watch out for. One miscalculation, and a rider could easily be thrown from the race. Hey, Cale! No bike today? I guess your sponsor forgot. Oh, that's right! You don't have a sponsor. Trent. Hey. [Whooping] Ah! Oh, my God! You've got to be kidding me. What's next, guys, hot dogs? Give 'em hell, Cale, okay? You've worked hard, and you deserve this. Hey, we all have. [Justin] Come on, Cale! You can do this, bro! [Announcer] We're almost ready to begin. The starter will check each rider-- It's Cale! It's Cale! Right there, Mommy! That was Cale! Come on, Cale! You can do it! All good? Good? Good? Good? Ready. We are seconds away from the final moto. Whose day will it be? Hey, bro. Now, Grant, you've felt the pressure of this race-day moment many times. What are these young riders thinking as they prepare to drop the clutch? Is it a matter of-- Now, hold on. Wait. One rider seems to be having a problem. Oh, and it appears Cale Bryant is backing away from the starting line. [Trent] What's going on? Cale, what are you doing? I'm assuming he must have some sort of a technical problem out there. - Now he's back on the bike again. - What the hell is he doing? He's backed up from the gate and appears to be trying a running start-- a very bold move. There they go! - Oh, yes! - Yeah! Attaboy! [Alex] Come on, Cale! Cale Bryant risks total disaster and times the gate perfectly. He nails the holeshot, and, man, Derek Black is all over him! [Grant] That was one gutsy move. [Announcer] Look at these guys go. Cale Bryant hammered through that turn. He is hot right now, with Derek Black a close second. Go, Cale! Go, go, go, go, go! Do it! [Announcer] Number 71 has the lead. Cale Bryant, with Derek Black, 37, in second place, and they have left the pack behind by several lengths so far. Cale Bryant into the turn. He is on fire. Go, Cale! Go! Take it easy, bro. Cale Bryant fighting for first, with Derek Black pressing down hard. Cale Bryant in the lead. He's taking that turn high on the hill, but Derek Black's coming on, pushing him higher. Derek Black is pushing him up. He's pushing. He's pushing him. - Cale is out! Cale Bryant is out! - Cale! [Announcer] Bryant is down! Oh! Oh, my God. And Derek Black takes the lead. - Cale Bryant is up, and he's back in the race-- - Oh! but a long way out. I don't know if there's any way he can catch Derek Black, who is still leading the pack. [Grant] Bryant is back up, but he is way back in the pack. He seems to be in about ninth place right now. [Announcer] And Cale Bryant has moved into eighth-- no, seventh-- - Wait. Sixth place! - Go, Cale! Come on! [Announcer] Bryant, number 71, moving up fast. This is amazing, folks. He's taking some big risks out there, but they're paying off, and he's narrowing the gap. Yeah! Yes! [Announcer] Cale Bryant has moved into second place, and, boys and girls, we have ourselves a race. Come on, Cale! Derek Black still has a big lead, but Bryant is chasing him down. Yeah! It's a two-man race, folks-- a two-man race-- with Black in the lead, and Bryant right behind. - Come on, buddy. Throttle down! Throttle down! - Look at Cale Bryant go! He is chasing him down. It looks like Black is gonna try and cut him off again. Oh! Bryant does a brake check, and knocks Derek Black off his bike and out of the lead. - Cale Bryant is out in front. - Yeah, Cale! Whoo! Oh, my God! Wow! Get him, buddy! This is amazing. All the way from the back of the pack, Cale Bryant is now in first place. [Grant] It's gonna seem like the longest lap of his life. He lost his chain. - Cale! - No, Cale! [Announcer] Oh, Cale Bryant is down! Cale Bryant is down! - It's over. - He seems to have lost his chain, folks. It's all over for Cale Bryant. Cale! [Trent] Get up, buddy! Come on. Get up! [Groans, Grunts] [Announcer] Now Derek Black is back up, and he may still have a chance here. Derek Black is back up. Bryant is on his feet. - What the heck is he doing? - He seems okay, but his machine is done for the day. [Trent] This is beautiful. Come on, Cale! Yeah! Go, Cale! [Trent] Keep it going. Keep it coming. Come on. Push. Push. Come on, Cale! This is quite remarkable. I have never seen anything like this. [Grunting] [Trent, Justin Shouting] Keep going, buddy! Ace that finish line! Come on! Yeah, Cale! Go! [Announcer] Cale Bryant is pushing his bike to the finish line. Derek Black, moving on in second, coming hard and fast. Derek Black is coming at him hard and fast. Cale Bryant wins! [Screams] And Cale Bryant has done the impossible. He's literally dragged his bike across the finish line for first place. Cale Bryant wins! Cale Bryant wins! [Alex] Cale! Cale, you won! [Screams] Hey, buddy, come on. You guys see that? You can't push a bike across the line. That's illegal. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold up, hold up. Cale, you have to be aboard your bike when you cross the finish line. I'm sorry. You're disqualified. [Announcer] Derek Black takes the checkered flag and 100 points. [Cheering] [Laughing] Yeah. Hey, man, congratulations. Thanks. Cale! Hey, hey. Wait up, bro. I've got a bad leg. [Announcer] Champion, Derek Black! You good? Yeah, I'm good. Ladies and gentlemen, A.M.A. Motocross Champion Grant Langston! I've been around the sport for more than 20 years, and I have never seen anything... like I witnessed out there today-- Cale Bryant pushing his broken motorcycle across the finish line. Cale, where are you? Cale Bryant, can you come to the podium, please? Come on up. Cale Bryant, pushing that broken motorcycle across the finish line, turning round to go and pick up a wounded friend-- That took guts. Cale, on that note, I just want to say, welcome to the pro tour. Congratulations. What? - Yeah! - [Bailey] He did it! Uh-huh! Oh, yeah! - My son won! - We never said we want to pick the winner. We said we'd pick the best rider. I'm taking this to the A.M.A.-- Hey, you know what, Dad? Just shut up for once, please. Come on now, Son. I'm just trying to help you. - Come here. - You won that race. Come on. Hey-- Would you put your hands together for our new pro rider, Cale Bryant! - Oh! - Whoo! That's our boy. That's our boy. [Justin] Yeah, buddy! Attaboy, Cale! Whoo-hoo! I'm so proud of you. Whoo! Whoo! [Laughing] Yeah! [Rock] - You really want to do this, Maynard? - You backing out already? Nah, college boy. I'm just giving you an easy way out. - Remember, you're pretty rusty. - I'm never too rusty to dust your-- I guess we'll find out. You guys ready? Yeah. Yeah. - Dude. - I know. Yeah. Okay? Here we go! Looking back on the photo album of my life  It's the little things that make me smile  That-That make me smile  Like the very first time that you discovered true love  Whoo-hoo! It's a feeling you can't describe  Yeah! But it always stays on your mind  Or the first time you hear a song on the radio  That gives you goose bumps all over from head to toe  Or the time you stayed up all night talking on the phone  And you looked up and realized she's staring at the same star as you  [People Laughing] That's what makes me sentimental  All right. I could probably use a few things. All right. You want to help me? [Phone Rings] Oh, goodness gracious. Hello! Find Crystal and tell her I'm here. I mean-- Wait. Crap. Find Crystal-- Hold on. These are the moments that matter, matter  I just forgot my line. I figured out  Oh, my God. Crap, it's my line. What is the line? Oh, my God. Yeah. Trust, trust, family and love  Are we doing my version? Which version? Just the entrance fee. How does this go? I've never seen a grown man beg so much in my life. Why? I'll be back. Matter to me  [Laughs] Yeah. "To the flag"? To the flag! He's a moron. Jerk face. Idiot. What a turd. What the hell is your problem? No, that's not right. [Laughs] Sorry. Justin! Uh-- Cale? [Laughing] Get out of here, you pig!
