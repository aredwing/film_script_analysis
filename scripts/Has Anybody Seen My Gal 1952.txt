"...of Hilverton, Vermont, my entire estate, which consists of..." Never mind that. I know what it consists of. - Mr Fulton... - Yes? - Dr Wallace is here. - Well, show him in. - Hello, Doctor. - Hello, Norton. - Well, Sam, how are we this morning? - You look all right, but I'm sick as a dog. You'd feel better with some fresh air. Don't open that window! You'll blow me out of bed! That's one way of getting you out of bed. You're murdering me! Is that will ready for my signature? - Yes, Mr Fulton. - Will? Just don't eat roughage, don't drink liquor, don't smoke and don't worry... ...and you'll outlive all your heirs. Are these Blaisdells relatives? You know I haven't a relative in the world. - Then why name them your heirs? - Sheer gratitude. Mrs Blaisdell's mother was responsible for my fortune. I was in love with her when I was young. It never occurred to me you could have been in love. - It didn't, eh? - Normal. Just as I thought. What's this? One, two, three... Eight? You're only supposed to smoke one cigar a day. I'm six months ahead of schedule. This was taken in front of the Hilverton Library. First time I ever saw her. - Well, she looks healthy. - She's quite lovely, if I may say so. If you may say so? You'd better say so. She was an absolute vision of loveliness. - Then why didn't you marry her? - I tried to, but she turned me down. Turned me down for a bookkeeper, a man earning $30 a week. You're leaving your estate to this woman's family because she turned you down? Exactly. If Millicent had said yes, I would have remained in Hilverton all my life... ...plodding along on $30 or $40 a week. But she said no, so I left, went to Alaska for gold, Texas for oil... ...and thereby built up my fortune to what it is today. - Didn't you ever see her again? - Never. She died a few years ago, shortly after her husband passed on. She left a daughter, Harriet, married to a man named Charles Blaisdell. Shouldn't you have a look at this family first? Are you suggesting that I, a sick man, go to Hilverton and investigate them? Why not? Shave off your beard - no one would recognise you. Splendid idea. Why don't you go away for a while? Indulge in some mental therapy like... Collecting wild flowers. You're a fine doctor! You ought to know that I'm allergic to flowers. Then painting or writing or bricklaying - just take your mind off your affairs. If she'd said yes, her family could've been your family. I've often thought of that. What if these Blaisdells turn out to be drunkards or spendthrifts? Nonsense. - Well, it's your money. - You're darn tootin' it is. Millie's children drunkards, spendthrifts! Bah! Bye. - Are you ready to sign this? - Don't rush me, don't rush me. You're not named in this will. Get out. - 40 years ago. Seems like yesterday. - What does? I was just thinking that's the last time I took a book out - 40 years ago. 40 years ago? Wow. At two cents a day overdue charges, you owe them a fortune! Goodbye, Debbie. - How are you, Fred? - Just fine, Miss Blaisdell, just fine. - Blaisdell? - Uh-huh. Millie Blaisdell. # Five foot two, eyes of blue But, oh, what those five feet can do... - # Has anybody seen my gal? - Hi, Millie. Hi, Dan. # Turned-up nose, turned-down hose, Never had no other beaus... # Has anybody seen my gal? # Now, if you run into a five-foot-two all covered with fur... # Diamond rings and all those things, Bet your life it isn't her... # Oh, could she love, could she woo, could she, could she, could she coo... # Has anybody seen my gal? - Come on, gramps, shake a leg. - If I do, it'll be against your derrire. - Nice going, gramps. - Where's my soda, Dan? Freddie wants a chocolate malt with vanilla ice cream. No, Dan, a vanilla malt with chocolate ice cream. - Hey, what's with my Black Cow, Dan? - One at a time, one at a time! - Mr Blaisdell. - Yes, Dan, be with you in a minute. - I hope she feels better, Tom - Thanks, Charlie. There are a couple of packages to wrap, Millie. Yes, sir? - Box of aspirin, please. - Headache? No, but if I stay in this madhouse long I'll have one. I don't like it either, but that soda fountain makes more money than the whole store. Blaisdell's Pharmacy? Oh, hello, Harriet. Yes, she's here. Yes, I'll tell her. - Mother? - She wants you home right away. - Will do. Goodbye, Daddy. - Bye, Millie. - Huh? - That'll be 15 cents. 15 cents? I can get this in New York for 14 cents! If you want to spend $11 fare to New York to get that for 14 cents, it's fine with me. I've gotta go, Dan. See you tonight? You bet. Eight o'clock. There's a good... Yes, sir? - Double bromo. - One double bromo. - There's a good movie at the Strand. - What is it? Bessie Love and Tom Moore in Anybody Here Seen Kelly? - Oh, that'll be the cat's pyjamas! - Bye, Millie. See you at eight. Hey, Dan? Where's my soda? One double bromo. What is this? - That's the best bromo I ever had. - Thank you, sir. - Hey, mister! - Huh? 10 cents. A double bromo. 10 cents. Wasn't worth it. I wish to put an advertisement in the late edition. Ma, the paper's here. - When did you say Dan's coming over? - Eight o'clock. We're going to the Strand. Anybody Here Seen Kelly? I'll get it. - Good evening, young lady. - Good evening. - May I ask who you are? - You may. I'm Roberta. Who are you? I am Mr Smith. Mr John Smith. The John Smith who was in love with Pocahontas? My dear young lady, do I look 300 years old? Don't answer that question. - May I see your mother? - Yes? - Oh, are you Mrs Blaisdell? - I am. - I've come in answer to your advert. - Our what? You advertised for a boarder. Said you had a pleasant room and excellent food. There must be some mistake. There's no mistake. Is that the Courier? I'll show you. There it is, in black and white. "Boarder wanted. Pleasant room and excellent food, $8 a week. 302 Maple St." - That's our address all right, but... - Maybe Poppa did it for extra money. Daddy wouldn't do that without telling us. - If you'll show me to my room... - I have no intention of taking in a boarder. Then why did you advertise for one? Don't you realise that to advertise falsely is blatant misrepresentation... ...for which you can be held accountable in court? - I did not advertise. - Perhaps it's a joke. Laugh if you wish - after you've shown me to my room. But we have no room. Nonsense. In a big house like this there must be a room somewhere. How about that room next to the attic, the one Grandma lived in after Grandpa died? Sounds enchanting. I'll take it. If you'll kindly lead the way... - I'll take you up. - Really, Mr Smith... I'll give you a week's payment in advance. You may send the receipt up to my room. - By the way, what time is dinner? - Seven o'clock. I usually dine at 6:30, but I imagine I can survive till seven. I'm sure you'll like the room. It just has a gorgeous view. You have a nice porch, too. Grandma used to love to sit out here. Oh, let me help you. - Quiet, Penny. - What's she barking about? It's not a she, it's a he. He's barking because this is his bed. Don't tell me I'm supposed to sleep with him. Oh, no. Penny's used to sleeping alone. He's really a wonderful dog. Poppa says he's a purebred mongrel. What's this? It's an easel. You see, I'm an artist. No fooling! Golly, an honest-to-goodness artist living with us! Penny, this is not a newspaper. "How to Paint in Ten Easy Lessons." That's something I wrote anonymously when I was an instructor in Paris. - Paris? - Yes, Paris. You see, I... Millicent. That's my grandma. She died when I was six. A beautiful woman. A far cry from the flappers of today. I don't take after her at all, but Millie - My sister - Looks just like her. I wish I was as beautiful as Millie. I'm sure you will be, my dear, when you grow up. I have a feeling you will become a captivating creature. - Is that good or bad? - Good for you, but bad for the boys. Why didn't you call the Courier and find out who inserted it? I did. The person who took the ad had left for the day. What'll my friends think, taking a boarder? None of the better families would do that. You mean "richer", not "better", Howard. And stop shedding hair everywhere. If I can put up with your music, you can put up with this hair. Oh, this is ridiculous! Harriet, I'm going to tell this man he has to leave at once. - But he paid in advance. - Mother gave him a receipt. You what? Oh, for Pete's sake! Really, Charles, it isn't as bad as I thought. We never use that room... ...and we can use the money, what with these two going to college. $8 a week will come in very handy. And I need a new winter coat. I'm not taking in boarders. I make enough to support my family and I'll continue to do so. He stays the week. Then he goes. Shh. - Oh, Mr Smith. - Him? I'd like you to meet my husband and my son Howard. I'm delighted to meet you. I'm sure we'll all be very happy here together. - You did say dinner at seven? - We'll be a little late this evening. In that case I shall go back to my room and finish unpacking. Be good enough to call me when dinner is ready, please. You know what? Mr Smith is an artist - A great artist. He's been all over the world - Paris, London, New York... Gosh, everywhere. He's an artist all right, your Mr Smith - a gyp artist. Charles. This afternoon he tried to argue me out of a penny for a box of aspirins. Then he tried to run out without paying Dan a dime for a bromo. - Better lock up the family silver. - Gee, and he seems such a nice man. - I like him more than any boys I know. - I'd keep a sharp eye on him. He looks like a pretty smooth article, if you ask me. No singing at the table, Roberta. Mrs Blaisdell, I neglected to inform you I can't eat the food customarily served. I must confine myself to soft food - Eggs, milk, mashed bananas and boiled fish. - So if you'll be good enough... - This is not a restaurant. We all eat the same thing or we don't eat at all. Taste it, Mr Smith. Momma makes the best stew in Hilverton. - Really? - Mm-hm. Stew. - I wish I had a car, Dad. - I wish I did, too. - All the frat fellows have a car except me. - Then join another frat. Howard, didn't we just buy you a brand-new raccoon coat? Yeah - A brand-new used one. If you didn't comb it so much it wouldn't look so used. Sometimes I wish we were so rich we didn't have to pay bills. Roberta, there's no disgrace in being poor. Remember that. Probably the only good thing that can be said about it. I'll get it. - How do you like it? - I'll manage to worry it down. Hello? Oh, yes, Carl, she is. Just a moment and I'll call her. - Millicent, Carl's on the phone. - Ask him what he wants. She's busy at the moment, Carl. Could I take a message? Oh, yes, I know she'd be delighted to see you. Shall we say about quarter to eight? Fine. She'll be ready. Goodbye. - Mother, you knew I had a date with Dan! - Oh, I forgot. Operator. She didn't really forget. She just wants my sister to go out with Carl cos he's rich. Do you think she should marry a man just because he's rich? After I finish this, I'll give you my considered opinion. - What are you doing? - I'll tell him I can't see him. You can't do that. He'd be offended. What's the harm of going out with him just this once? But, Harriet, she has a date with Dan. She can see Dan any time, and how often does a boy like Carl Pennock call? Millie, you should be flattered. The Pennocks are the most important family in town. I don't care how important they are. I won't go. Please, Millie, do it for my sake. You wouldn't want to make a fool out of your mother, would you? Of course not, but... Carl is such a lovely boy, and so sophisticated. I'm sure you'll like him when you get to know him. Now run along upstairs and get ready like a good girl. But what about Dan? He hasn't got a phone. Just let me handle Dan. You'll be gone by the time Dan gets here. Well, all right. Oh, and Millie? Wear your long dress, the one that comes down to your knees. Clear these dishes, Roberta. I want it spick and span when Carl gets here. Yes, Momma. Excuse me. - Hello, kid. - Kid yourself. Millicent! - Good evening, Carl. - Hello, Mrs Blaisdell. - Your sheik's here. - I'll be right down. Do come in. - Good evening, Mr Blaisdell. - Hello, Carl. Hi, Howie. - That new car you have is the veryest. - I'll take you for a spin someday. - Mr Smith, this is Mr Pennock. - How do you do, young man? Mr Smith is staying with us for a while. He's... An old friend of the family. He's exactly three hours old now. Hello, Carl. Hot diggity, Millie! You're the cat's miaow! Thank you, Carl. Well, good night, everybody. - Have a good time. - Don't stay out too late. Good night. Five minutes with him and a girl has a past. He seems pleasant enough, but I'm not at all certain that I like this boy. Thank you. Charles, I know what I'm doing. I'm not permitting my daughter to make the same mistake my mother made. You know what, Mr Smith? Grandma could've married Samuel G Fulton. - Who? - The richest man in the world. - Instead she married the poorest. - Your grandfather wasn't the poorest! Are you serious? Your mother could've married the Samuel G Fulton? Yes. But she didn't love him, so she married Father. Of course, Fulton wasn't rich then... ...but I imagine anyone could've told he'd amount to something... ...compared to poor Poppa, who remained a bookkeeper all his life. I'm not sorry she married Grandpa. I once saw a picture of Mr Fulton. You should see that beard he's got. I bet if Grandma had married him I'd have a beard now. - Roberta, it's time you went to bed. - But it isn't even eight o'clock yet. She seemed happy with your father, and he never made more than $35 a week. You must remember things were much cheaper then. Look at how much it costs to live today - steak 35 cents a pound, bacon 32... ...eggs 33 cents a dozen... Why, a person has to be a millionaire to make ends meet. That must be Dan. I'll get it. - Hi, Dan. - Hello. Millicent ready? She's already left. Millicent asked me to apologise. She had a previous date and forgot about it. - A date? With who? - Carl Pennock. That cake-eater. I counted on going to the movies with Millicent. I guess I'll have to go alone. Don't be discouraged, Dan. Only the brave deserve the fair. From what I've observed, only the brave can live with some of them. Good night. You've a lovely family, Millicent. Could've been mine if you hadn't been so darned obstinate. What time is it? Oh... So I am supposed to sleep with you, eh? - Scare you? - No, it amuses me to be almost run over. That's what I like about you - you've got a great sense of humour. She has to have, or she wouldn't go out with you. Quiet, brat. Hop in, we'll go for a spin. No, I'm sorry, my mother expects me home. Not any more. I was just there. I told her I was coming to get you. Well, all right. Roberta, tell Mother I'll be home in an hour. Tell her she won't be home for dinner. Skidoo. # When the red red robin comes bob-bob-bobbin' along... - Hi, Mr Smith. Where are you going? - I thought I'd go for a walk. But you promised to take me painting. I know what: You get your easel and I'll get mine. We'll go up to Indian Hill. Well, I don't think we'd better do it today. I suddenly feel tired. I think I'd better stay home. Even better. We can paint from your balcony. You have a wonderful view. Come on. # I'm just a kid again Doing what I did again... # Singing a song... # When the red red robin comes bob-bob-bobbin' along... # When the red red robin comes bob-bob-bobbin' along, along... # There'll be no more sobbing when he starts throbbing... # His old sweet song... # Wake up, wake up, you sleepy-head... # Get up, get up, get out of bed Cheer up... - How about that barn? - You start and I'll copy everything you do. No, I think everyone should try to be original. - You paint it your way, I'll paint it mine. - OK. # Rain may glisten, but still I listen... # For hours and hours... # I'm just a kid again, doing what I did again... # Singing a song... # When the red red robin comes bob-bob-bobbin' along... Gosh, I like being with you. I'm gonna miss you tomorrow. - Why, won't you be home? - I will, but you won't. Poppa told Mother you must go tomorrow, hot or cold - whatever that means. Penny'll miss you too, even though he'll have his bed back. Won't you, Penny? Penny! There. How do you like it so far, Mr Smith? That's splendid. I never could've done that when I was your age. Course not. That barn was only built three years ago. Now let's see what you've done. Why, Mr Smith, whatever is it? - That is surrealism. - Sir what? Surrealism. A new school of painting founded in Paris. Instead of painting what you see, you paint what you feel inside. At least, that's what they say it means. - Is this what you feel inside? - Yes. Gosh, you must be all mixed up. You gonna frame it and hang it in your room? No. Hanging's too good for it. Whatever are you doing? It's no good. Especially compared to yours. That's a waste. This paper costs two cents a sheet. You could've used the other side. Oh, Poppa will buy me more. Wish I had a rich poppa. Hi, George. See, Mr Smith? That's the frame I told you about. It'd make a wonderful frame for your painting and wouldn't cost anything. - That's a very good frame. - Isn't it? Yes, sir, a very nice frame indeed. Poppa, can I have that Circe Soap frame for Mr Smith's painting? - Just a moment, darling. - How long are we supposed to wait? - Sorry to keep you. - What kind of a fountain is this? Be patient, will you, fellas? Here is my latest import. Poppa, can I have it, please? - Yes, dear. - Oh, boy! - Come on, let's go to the Cherry Pit. - At least somebody'll wait on us there. Thank you. Come again, Mrs Gates. - Why isn't Dan behind the soda fountain? - I sent him out to deliver medicine. Then I had to wait on some customers, so there was no one to tend the fountain. - You should hire a soda jerker. - I've tried to... ...but all I can pay is $12 a week and nobody wants to work for that. - Although in my day it was a good wage. - In my day it was even better. Too bad. You're losing a lot of business. I know. Why don't you work for Poppa? Me, a soda jerker? I don't know the difference between a parfait and a soda. The difference is a nickel. Dan can teach you soon enough. I'll give you $12 a week. How's that? I'll make you a proposition. Instead of you giving me $12 a week... I continue boarding at your house and you give me $5 a week in cash. But that's the equivalent of $13 per week. That's a dollar more than I contemplated. - Take it or leave it. - Take it, Poppa. Now you can buy a lot of paper and we can paint on your day off. You drive a hard bargain, but it's a deal. You'll have to sweep up and run errands to customers. - Sweep up and run errands? - Take it or leave it. Take it, Mr Smith. - OK, I'll take it. - Good. Hi, Dan. I wish you'd get a new bicycle. Either it's too short or my legs are too long. - Meet our new soda jerk. - Him? Well, I guess you're better than no one. All right, come around here, gramps. Get rid of that smokestack, take off your coat and I'll show you the ropes. One Tutti-Frutti Delight, coming up. Right back here. Come on. Cheater. OK, gramps. One Tutti-Frutti Delight, coming up. Watch me. One Strawberry Surprise. Now your turn. Watch me. One Strawberry Surprise. All right, once again. One Strawberry... Surprise. One Vesuvius. All right, come on. One Vesuvius. - Coming your way, Tony. - Got it, Gramps. Gramps, I'll have a choc malt, heavy on the choc, plenty of milk... ...four spoons of malt, two scoops of vanilla ice cream, one mixed in and one floating. Would you like to come in Wednesday for a fitting? Thank you. - Hello, Mr Smith. - Hello, Millie. - Is Dan in the back? - No, he's off today. Oh. Oh, Millie... Try the library. Thank you, Mr Smith. - Hello, Dan. - Millie! What are you reading? It Something which I evidently haven't got. Why, I think you have, Dan. - I think you have lots of "it". - But not as much as Carl. I get the heebie-jeebies when I think you're his Sheba. But I'm not. I mean, well, I'm not any more. No kiddin'? So you finally found out what an Airedale he is. What about your mother? She's furious with the Pennocks - they're giving a party and didn't invite me. - Yippee! - Shh! Don't you know this is a library? Sorry. Let's get out of here. Sorry. # Give me a little kiss, will ya, huh? # What're you gonna miss? Will ya, huh? # Gosh, oh gee, why do you refuse? # I can't see what you got to lose... # Oh, give me a little squeeze, will ya, huh? # Anything you ask, I'll do... # I wouldn't say a word if I were asking for the world... # But what's a little kiss between a fella and his girl? # Oh, give me a little kiss, will ya, huh? # And I'll give it right back to you... Thanks, bud. I wish we had money. I'd show those Pennocks a thing or two! - Treating Millicent as if she were... - Guess what? Guess what? I'm engaged! Engaged... To be married? Now that's a silly question. What else could she be engaged for? I hope you don't object. Of course not! Congratulations, my boy! That's wonderful! Engaged! Gosh, that's almost as good as married. It's frequently better. - My best wishes. - Thanks, Gramps. You're engaged to Dan? Isn't it wonderful? We were going by the fire house when he asked me. I hurried home to tell you. - Well, what's there to cry about? - Mother! I wanted my daughter to marry someone who could give her the things I never had. - I resent that! - All right, my dear. Your father doesn't seem to have any objections, so I hope you'll be very happy. Thank you, Momma. Can Dan stay for dinner? Yes. Dan, Mom wants you to stay for dinner. We're having hamburgers. Hamburgers... If he's to be my son-in-law... I guess I might as well get used to having him around the table. Come on, forward. Come on, I'll show you the step. Move forward three. You start jiggling your hands... Down. Watch me. That's it. Oh... - I'm afraid it's hopeless. - I'm afraid it is. Come on, everybody, let's drink to the happy couple. Howard, draw the blinds. Do you want us all to be arrested? Here you are, Mr Smith. - Dan. - Thank you, sir. - To the future Mrs Dan Stebbins. - Thank you, Dad. - I hope you both have lots of luck. - Thanks, Mr Blaisdell. Mrs Dan Stebbins. Doesn't that sound wonderful? - Good luck Millie, Dan. - Thanks, Howie. Great stuff, isn't it? My bootlegger says it's real bathtub gin. He must've been taking a bath when he made it. I'll get it. Hide the hooch, quick. It may be a policeman. Good evening. Is this the residence of Mr and Mrs Blaisdell? - Yes, sir. - May I see them? Sure. My sister just got engaged in the middle of dinner. Oh. I hope I'm not intruding. - Are you Mr Blaisdell? - That is Mr Blaisdell. How do you do? Edward Norton. I'm attorney for the Hamilton Trust Company. If it's about my mortgage, I'll be able to meet that payment in a few more days. - Business is a little slow... - I'm here on another matter entirely. Oh? - Well, sit down, won't you? - Thank you. - This is my wife. - Oh. How do you do, Mrs Blaisdell? Good evening. - And my son Howard. - Hi. My daughter Roberta. - My daughter Millicent. - How do you do? - And my future son-in-law, Dan Stebbins. - Happy to know you, Mr Stebbins. And?... - This is Mr Smith. He's staying with us. - How do you do? - I didn't catch the name. - Smith. S-M-l-T-H. First name is John. John Smith. And I've never been in love with Pocahontas. Mr Smith is Poppa's soda jerker. - Soda jerker? - One of the best. If you were to be in town for a while, try one of my Tutti-Frutti Delights. - Tutti-Frutti... - What did you wish to see us about? What? Oh, yes. I've been authorised to deliver into your hands this cheque. - Cheque? - Cheque? - Cheque? - Cheque? What is it, an advertisement? I know - Bring in this cheque and you get a $75 icebox for $60. Mrs Blaisdell, may I suggest you read it? "Pay to the order of Mr and Mrs Charles Blaisdell $100,000." "Hamilton Trust Company." Well, I don't understand, Mr Norton. Just what is this? The money is yours. You may do with it whatever you wish. - I don't recognise the signature. - Naturally not. It's a cashier's cheque. - Who would want to give us $100,000? - That I'm not permitted to disclose. All you need know is that the gentleman who sent it is a wealthy eccentric. You mean he's?... Well, let's say that his behaviour at times is exceedingly peculiar, to say the least. He's crazy. Why is this unknown eccentric giving us the money? Yes, why? If you have doubts, talk to Mr Parker, manager of the Hilverton Bank. Mr Parker holds the mortgage on my store. He's our representative. I've just come from his home... ...where I informed him this cheque would be put through his bank. - Give me 369, please. - Have a cigar, Mr Norton. They're two for a nickel. We call them Hilverton Stinkers. I thought the doctor said you weren't to smoke. Pay no attention to doctors, Mr Norton. I never do. There's a Mr Edward Norton here... Oh... He was? I see. Then it's legitimate. Of course we're delighted. I'll be over first thing in the morning. $100,000... - Mother! - I'll get some water. - What are you doing with my cheque? - I'm sorry if I've caused you to become ill. Sorry? Mr Norton's sorry. All my life I've hoped, I've dreamed of suddenly becoming wealthy... ...and now it's come true! Whoopee! Hot diggity-dog! Mother! - Some coffee? A bite perhaps? - I won't have time. Mr Norton, Mrs Blaisdell makes the best stew in Hilverton. You should taste it. - Stew... Stew? - Yes. I can't get enough of it. - Roberta? - Yes, Poppa? Get the bottle of champagne. Under my bed. - And cool it. - Cool it, dear. - Of course you'll have a drink with us. - No, I must be in New York by morning. Sorry I won't have time to taste a Tutti-Frutti Delight. - It's your loss. - Oh, thank you, Mr Norton. And do thank whoever sent us the cheque. - I will. Good night, good luck to all of you. - I'll see you to the door. $100,000! Wow! - When are you leaving here? - Not for some time. I've got the champagne! I want to hang around and see... Quiet, Penny, quiet. - Is that your dog? - No, I'm only sleeping on his bed. Go away, Penny, and stop eavesdropping. Go away, Penny. You know, that seems a nice family. I hope the money doesn't change them. It won't, if I'm any judge of people. I must say, you're looking well, in spite of eating stew and smoking cigars... ...and working as a soda jerker. Maybe that's why I'm looking so well. Oh, yes, I forgot. Take these pills back and get a refund. I don't use them any more. Goodbye. Mother, what are we going to do with all that money? The first thing we'll do is move out of this old house. We'll buy a house up on the hill, where all the best people live. And we'll get a car... - And a chauffeur. - Two. And we'll buy brand-new clothes and... everything brand-new! The first thing to do is pay off the mortgage on the store. You'll sell the store. What are you talking about? I've put 20 years of my life into that store! We're going to assume our proper position in society. We couldn't do that if you remained a shopkeeper. I'll show those Pennocks now! My daughter isn't good enough for Carl, huh? Well, perhaps now Carl isn't good enough for my daughter. What are you talking about Carl for? She just got engaged to Dan. - That? That was before we were wealthy. - Mother! You're going to move in a completely different circle. Dan couldn't keep you in the style to which you'll become accustomed. You wouldn't it said you married Millicent for her money. Don't worry about that. That's one thing people will never say about me. She's right. That cheque changed everything. - I'm in no position to marry a rich girl. - Dan! Now see what you've done! Harriet, you had no right to behave that way. Of course I have. I've always wanted her to have the best life had to offer. - Now I can finally give it to you. - Mother, you've spoiled everything! Here, Poppa. I got it as cold as I could. No sense in opening it now. Everybody's gone. I'll put it back under the bed. Oh, Mr Smith, I'm so happy! We're millionaires! Not quite, my dear. You've only got $100,000. To be considered a millionaire you must have at least $200,000. Oh, Penny, we're rich, we're rich! From now on you'll eat nothing but steak. He will not. You'll get rid of that mongrel. We'll get two pedigree French poodles. French poodles? But I can't speak French. I don't want French poodles. I don't like French poodles. Nonsense. All the best people have French poodles. But I want Penny! Well, this has been quite an exciting evening. I guess I may as well go to bed. Good night. Oh, Mr Smith... You'll have to look for lodgings elsewhere - immediately. Elsewhere? But why? I'm quite comfortable here. Well, now that we're wealthy I certainly don't intend to keep a boarder. Gorgeous. Put it down. Thank you. - Paris creation. - How much? - We'll take it. - Thank you. This would be lovely for my daughter. - How much? - $200. - It's a bargain. We'll take it. - Thank you. Oh, this I must have. Don't you think I'll look divine in green? - We'll take it. - Thank you. They say it's a quarter of a million dollars. The lucky stiff. Half a million dollars dropped right into his lap. I understand it was three quarters of a million. - Why couldn't that happen to me? - Or to me? Yes, it was one million dollars in cash! Imagine that! Shh, shh. One million dollars! Step right in, folks, and take a look around. Take a look at that beautiful foyer. Notice that wonderful curving staircase. And the architecture! Yes, friends, you'll enjoy living in a place like this. - In fact, it's the biggest house in town. - It's the biggest price in town. - It's bigger than the Pennock house. - Yes, isn't it? We'll take it, Mr Wilson. And I know just how I'm going to furnish it - All moderne. - I like Louis XIV. - Oh, we'll have some of that too. We can afford anything now. - Hello, everybody. - You should know, Carl. Is it true they were given $1 million by an uncle who discovered gold in Alaska? I heard it was a cousin in Texas who left them his oil wells. I don't know who left them the money, but I do know, from what Howard's told me... ...that they're worth several million dollars. Several million? - Oh, your Carl is such a handsome boy. - Thank you, darling. - And that angel face of Millie's. - Oh, thank you. Oh, is it serious? Oh, this will be the talk of Hilverton. A union between the Pennocks and the Blaisdells. - You'll have a pink lady, of course. - I'd adore one. - Seor Alvarez, madam. - Oh, do show him in, Fredericks. Enchanted, Madame. Oh, but four such lovely ladies! I am overwhelmed. Seor, you are trs charmant... Merci Madame, would you tell the butler and the maid to clear a dance area? - Fredericks. - Madame is too gracious. Now, Madame, music. The essence of tango is an innocent, gliding, perpetual motion. Shall we dance? One, two, three, four... Brrrm! Glissando! Step and inside... Brrrm! Glissando, step and inside... Now cheek to cheek. One, two, three, four... One, two, three, four... Brrrm! Glissando! Step and inside... Brrrm! Glissando... Easy, isn't it? Oh, yes. We're through. Finished. Let her marry Carl, for all I care. - Perhaps that'd be best for you. - What do you mean? Well, look at it this way. Marry Millicent, you'll be tied down in Hilverton the rest of your life. But with no responsibility, you can go anywhere, seize any opportunity... - You might even become a millionaire. - Then why aren't you a millionaire? Quiet, Penny, quiet. Come in. Oh, hello, Mr Smith. Hi, Dan. - Hello, Roberta. How are you, my dear? - Oh, Penny! Good old Penny! Gosh, I miss you. Oh, it's good to see you. Is Mr Smith taking good care of you? - Say, you're getting fat. - Why shouldn't he? He eats anything - including two pairs of my trousers and three of my shirts. Mr Smith, this room is terribly messy. What kind of a housekeeper are you? - Don't you ever clean up? - Every Sunday. How's Millicent? She's out with that egghead Carl all the time. He's taking her to Joe's tonight. That's a speakeasy. Millicent's never been to a speakeasy. Carl says it's about time she went to one. Why don't you take her out, Dan? I heard her say she likes you better than Carl. I have no interest in what Millicent says, does or likes. We'd better get back to the store. Can I stay for a while? I wanna give Penny a bath. Of course. Thank Howard for me - it was kind of him to give me his raccoon coat. I have a present for you too - Two cigars. - Where did you get these? - Poppa's humidor. Roberta! Oh, that's all right. We can afford anything now - we're millionaires. Penny! One Tutti-Frutti Delight coming up. - Smith! Stop drinking up all the profits! - Yes, Mr Quinn. Skinflint. - Evening, Clancy. - Good evening, Mr Quinn. Good evening, Pops. How about a cup of java and a doughnut? - Where's Mike? - I'm making the rounds alone tonight. - Is he having another baby? - No, no. They're using Mike in a raid on a speakeasy. I thought you only arrested bootleggers for late deliveries. That's the trouble with Prohibition - everybody jokes about it. The people at Joe's won't be joking when they wake up behind bars. The people at Joe's deserve to... - Did you say Joe's? - Uh-huh. - Which Joe's is that? - On Sutton St, next to Joe's barber shop. Beats me - Every Tom, Dick and Harry opens a place and calls it Joe's. Dan, I've got to leave. Close up for me, will you? Sure, Gramps. Mr Smith, where do you think you're going? I was just sending him out on a delivery. Get going then, Smith. And no dilly-dallying on the way. Yes, Mr Quinn. Sometimes I think that old coot is batty as a baseball game. - Yes? - Benny sent me. We don't know no Benny. Yeah? Well, where's the stuff? Hurry up and get it over here. I've had to cut my stock three times already. - Beg pardon, it was Sam sent me. - We don't know no Sam. Mo, Henry, Jack - what's the difference? I want to get in. Beat it and stop rapping on that door, or I'll rap on your skull. - We're friends of Sweeney's. - Oh, Sweeney. Come on in. - How are you tonight? - Fine. How are you? Mr Sweeney and I are close friends. He asked me to give you his regards. Sweeney? Why didn't you say so in the first place? His name escaped me for the moment. Ooh! Sorry. Ooh! Thank you. Now get away from me, young lady. That thing might be catching. - Anything wrong? - Oh, no, no, no. Just don't catch cold. Now this stuff is two months old. - Millicent! - Why, Mr Smith! You've got to get out of here. This place is going to be raided. That's a lot of banana oil! Nobody's taking my Sheba away from me. You have a lot of crust... Beat it, it's the bulls! - Out this window. - Lights out. We've gotta get out of here. All right, boys, round 'em up. Sorry. - Oh, Mr Smith! Are you hurt? - I'm all right. You go on. Come on. - You, Pops? - Mike! Never mind. On your way. John Smith. - John Smith! - All right, all right. - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - Yes, Your Honour. It's no wonder our youth is flaming, that it considers itself the lost generation... ...when an old man like you, who ought to know better... ...so flagrantly violates the law of the land. You are a horrible example for them. - But, Your Honour... - 30 days or $50. - Next case. - Fern Daniels. John Smith, your fine has been paid. Come on, junior. That stinker Carl, running out like that! I'd like to punch him in the eye. Why, Mr Smith. I hurried down to see if I could help. You shouldn't have - There was nothing to do but pay the fine, and Dan's done that. Oh. Well, how much was it? I did it because Gramps is my friend, not because I thought you'd pay me back. - You don't have to be so nasty about it. - I'm not. But just cos you've got money... Now, children, you mustn't quarrel over me. I've saved a little for a rainy day... ...and I'll give you the $50 as soon as we get back to our room. OK? - OK. - Your mother doesn't know, does she? No. I wanted to tell her, but Carl made me promise not to tell anyone. Well, perhaps it's best that way. But keep out of speakeasies from now on. Thank you, Mr Smith. The more I see of that Pennock boy, the less I like him. Sometimes I think his head must be made of cork. It's always at the end of a bottle. Now, this is the modern toothbrush. Sorry. I can recommend this very highly. But, Mr Batson, if you'll only give me another week... By tomorrow? But, Mr Batson, I don't know if I can have it that soon. All right, Mr Batson. I'll see what I can do. Howard? Can I help you? Sure. You got $2,000 to spare? $2,000? Did you lose at gambling? - How did you know? - I heard you in there. Talking to Batson, weren't you? I've heard some ugly gossip about Batson. Runs the poker game at the Three Leaf Inn, doesn't he? I don't know what to do, Mr Smith. I didn't intend to lose so much. I just kept getting in deeper and deeper and I gave my IOU for it. Won't your father help you? I don't want Dad to know I lost that much gambling. But if I don't give Mr Batson the money by tomorrow, he says he'll tell Dad. - Wish I'd been with you at the inn. - You? - Why, what could you have done? - I know something about cards. See, when I was young I spent a lot of time up at the Yukon. They play a lot of cards up there, play every night - ...and the nights are six months long. So I became quite an expert. I played cards one night for three months straight. Well, it's too late now. Just forget I said anything, will you, Mr Smith? I'm a bit new at this, gentlemen. I hope you'll be patient if I'm a bit slow. That's all right, Pop. Take your time. You think Silent Cal means it when he says he doesn't choose to run? Stop talking politics and play cards, will you? Sorry. I'm kind of awkward at dealing, too. Don't worry, chum. This is an honest game. Isn't that right, Sammy? - There you are. - How about another card? Oh, yes, I forgot, you use five cards, don't you? That's right. There. - Say, Batson, who's that old bird? - A new pigeon. - I'll lift it up 200. - Going up another 200. - I'm in. - I'm out. - Well, I'll lift it again. 200. - I'll see it. - I'm out. - Let's see what you're so proud of. - I've got a crowded cabin. - Crowded cabin? What's that? I thought you gentlemen understood poker. Three fives and a pair of aces. - I've only got three kings. - You might want to frame those. Next deal. There you are - $2,300. I'll take Howard Blaisdell's IOU for $2,000 and the balance in cash. Thank you, gentlemen. I can't recall a more enjoyable evening. - But I must go home. - To your crowded cabin, huh? The IOU... We're being raided! - May I help you with your coat? - Thank you. John Smith. Weren't you here before? I met Your Honour when they raided Joe's place. Oh, yes, I remember now. Evidently, Mr Smith, you are an incorrigible malefactor. - What? - Heaven knows where you'll turn up next. You're a menace to the community. Don't ever let me see you here again. - $100 or 60 days. - $100? - Next case. - Tom Phillips. # Oh, the night was dark and dreary... # The air was full of sleep... # The old man stood out in the storm His shoes were full of feet... # Oh, it ain't gonna rain no more, no more... # It ain't gonna rain no more... # How in the heck can I wash my neck if it ain't gonna rain no more? John Smith. Your fine's been paid. - So long, boys. - Johnny, don't forget your mink. - Be a good boy, Johnny. - We're gonna miss you. - Come back again. - So long, Johnny. OK, boys, OK. Enjoyed my visit with you. I'll see you again. Look, Gramps, if you don't cut this out I'm gonna run out of money. # Oh, it ain't gonna rain no more, no more... # It ain't gonna rain no more... Quinn was there when I got your call. He'd have fired you if I wasn't leaving. - You're quitting? - Gave two weeks' notice. - Where are you going? - Anywhere away from Hilverton. You mean away from Millicent. Remember what you said when our engagement was broken... ...that without a family I could go anywhere, do anything, even become a millionaire? - I've decided you were right. - I've decided I was wrong. If you leave Millicent, she'll marry Carl and you'll regret it the rest of your life. No matter how much wealth you acquire. You can be miserable with money, too. Maybe, but at least you can buy your own kind of misery. All right. I'm only trying to give you the benefit of an older man's experience. I'm beginning to think you're a phoney. - What do you mean by that? - You're not a painter, you're a preacher. Oh, that. - Good evening, young man. I w... - All deliveries in the rear. - Whippersnapper. - What's the matter, Mr Smith? Good evening, Howard. I have an engagement with Millicent. - Your butler said to use the rear entrance. - Don't pay any attention to him. You don't ever have to go around the rear. Mr Smith... You remember our conversation the other day about the $2,000 I owed Batson? Batson... Oh, that's the gambler that holds your IOU. His place was raided a couple of days ago. Did you know that? No, I didn't. But then I have no interest in gambling in any form. I received this in the mail the day after the raid. The IOU was torn in two, but it had that note. "Let this be a lesson to you." Signed "A friend." That's curious. Have you any idea who this friend is? I'm not sure. I'd like to meet him someday and assure him I have learned my lesson. In that case, I'm certain that this friend will consider his efforts well worthwhile. You go on in. I'm gonna go upstairs and change. Oh, just put those over there, Fredericks. It's ridiculous of you, Millicent, to miss my mah-jong party for Mr Smith... ...just to help him arrange his crazy paintings for that exhibit. He's such a sweet old man. I just adore him. I bet he wins, too. He did another sur... Oh, you know... Paintings yesterday. You should see it. Mr Smith said you have to stand on your head to appreciate it. - Good evening. - Oh, Mr Smith! - Have you met Mimi and Fifi yet? - No, not yet. - Come on. - Good evening, friendly. Mr Smith, Mimi and Fifi. Bonsoir, Mademoiselle Mimi, Mademoiselle Fifi... Do you like them? - I like Penny best. - So do I. I hope you won't keep Millicent out late. Fredericks, the door. I promise to have her home early. - My, but you're the cat's miaow, my dear. - Thank you. Shall we go? - How's Mr Quinn treating you? - "Treating" is not in his vocabulary. Judge and Mrs Wilkins. Harriet, how are you? Good evening, Harriet. How are you, Charles? Hello, Millicent. And... - Good night. - Good night, dear. - What's that person doing with Millicent? - Mr Smith? Why, he's an artist of sorts... ...and Millicent is helping him arrange his paintings for the exhibit. I hope he's not going to show her his etchings. - Of course not. He doesn't do etchings. - She's just trying to help the old man. That "old man" has been up before me twice - ...when they raided a speakeasy and a gambling casino. Smith? Are you certain? Of course. That old boy really gets around. I should inform you I have no intention of entering my paintings in the art exhibit. Then why do you want me to help you? That was a ruse to get you out of the house. I want to help you with Dan. He's given notice to Quinn and he's leaving Hilverton for good. I know he loves you and I think you feel the same way about him. If you could convince him there's a chance for the two of you... - I'm certain he would stay. - Do you know where he is? What do you think I brought you here for? Atchoo! I'm sorry. Sorry. Sit down. Sit down. - Get out of the light. - What? - Get out of the light. - Oh. Huh? Beg pardon. I thought you were someone else. Excuse me. - Hello, Gramps! Come on up here... - Hello, Dan. - What's the big idea? - She wanted to see this movie. - Remember how we used to come here? - Yeah, I remember. - You used to put your arm around me. - Things were different then. Dan... ...why are you going away? - Because there's nothing for me here. - But I'm here! Look, Millicent, we've been all through this before, and it's no use. Your family wants no part of me. You've got money and all I've got is hopes - But you can't live on hopes. So you do what your mother wants and marry your little Carl. You shouldn't have brought her here, Gramps. There, there, dear. Now, don't cry. If he doesn't love you enough to stay here and fight for you, he's a fool. Chewing gum, popcorn... It was wonderful, wasn't it? It's over? Scandalous! And there they were, necking... ...right in the theatre where everyone, but everyone, could see them. It was shameful. Shameful. I knew it! I knew it! Our little Millicent, necking in public! And with an old man! - Are you certain of this, Clarissa? - We both saw it. Look, this is exactly what they were doing. Why, Lester, it's been almost 20 years since you behaved this way. I was only demonstrating. Mr Pennock, this man evidently is a menace to the entire community. - I think he's after Millicent's money. - Of course that's what it is. But what could Millicent possibly see in him? Good heavens, Charles. She even said she adored him! Some older men are very attractive to young girls. - Aren't they, Shirley? - Oh, yes. You take a man like this Mr Smith. It'd be a simple matter for a scoundrel like him to turn the head of an innocent child. - Whatever he's got, I wish I had it. - What will people say? The disgrace! Hi, Mimi. Hello, Fifi. If it were me, I'd let nothing stand in my way, mother or no mother. I'd sweep you into my arms and defy the world. I wish young men of today were more like you. Did you hear that? Well, do something! - Good night. - Just a moment, Mr Smith. Just a moment. Oh, I can't tell you how disappointed I am in you. I took you into my house, gave you lodging and a job... ...and you repay me by taking advantage of my daughter's inexperience. That's no way to talk to an old Casanova like him! - Casanova? - Yes, Casanova! - Necking with my daughter in public! - Why, Mother! - Necking? - The Pennocks saw you in the Strand. Don't deny it. It was disgusting, to say the least. This is exactly what he was doing. Hold this. Lester, we've had enough demonstrating for one evening. I'm sure there's a statute covering necking in public... ...and I intend to prosecute you under it! You're not getting off with a fine this time! - But, Your Honour... - What are your intentions toward her? Honourable, Mr Blaisdell. Strictly honourable. - You want to marry her? - Nothing would delight me more. But you're over 60! Millicent's not even 20. You're three times as old as she is. That's true, but when I'm 80, she'll be 40. I'll be only twice as old then. If I live long enough she may even catch up with me. - This is preposterous! - Is it preposterous to love your daughter? - You're after her money, aren't you? - Aren't you? You didn't encourage your son until the Blaisdells had money. Do you think we'd tolerate having you for a son-in-law? Daddy! Is Mr Smith going to be my brother-in-law? Over my dead body! - What are you doing up? - I heard shouting. - Are you going to be my brother-in-law? - No, my dear. Now the child is here, let's stop these ridiculous accusations. My interest in Millicent is entirely paternal. - Is that why you were necking her? - I wasn't. I was comforting her. She was crying because Dan is leaving Hilverton. Dan? Did she see Dan? I thought Millicent was helping arrange your paintings. That was a little white lie I told to get your sister out of the house. - You're not gonna enter your paintings? - No, my dear. Roberta, this is the last time! You go to bed right this minute! - But, Daddy... - Roberta, go to bed, please. Oh, all right. I'm only the father, so perhaps I have no right to ask... ...but why did you want my daughter to meet Dan? Because you're forcing her to marry a man she doesn't care about. I like that! You, a complete stranger, a $12-a-week soda jerker... $13 a week. ...arranging my daughter's future! You've got a colossal nerve! For once I must agree with my wife. We can handle our own affairs. This nonsense about Dan has gone far enough. I'll stop it this minute. I say we announce the engagement of your son to my daughter immediately. I quite agree. - Mrs Blaisdell... - It doesn't matter any more. I'm never going to see Dan again anyway. Thanks for trying. And if you want to consider that necking too, you can do so. I wish we'd never gotten that money. Money, money, money. Hooray! It's snowing, it's snowing! Oh, it's snowing! Isn't it wonderful? We'll have snow for Christmas. Hey, you! Do you have to make so much noise playing "Silent Night"? Merry Christmas, ladies. When did he call you? And you had to call me long-distance about that? Why didn't you send me a letter? It'd cost two cents. Your trouble is you don't care how you spend my money. He said he had to have the money tonight. Tonight? Why? Some stock he held on margin took a sudden drop. I'm to let him know if the gentleman who gave him the money... ...will lend him another $25,000 to cover it. Frankly, Sam, I'm surprised. They seemed such a nice family. They are. Couldn't be nicer if they were my own. Let me handle this. Merry Christmas to you and your family, Ed. Merry Christmas. Bye. Smith. I timed you in that telephone booth. You were in there exactly 14 minutes. I'm going to deduct that from your wages, just to teach you that time is money. Mr Quinn, I've met many a skinflint in my day, but you abuse the privilege. And believe me, I know a skinflint when I see one! You're fired. Turn in your cap and apron. That, Mr Quinn, is a pleasure I've been anticipating for days... ...you cantankerous old goat! You're all wound up. You need a change. Some sort of mental therapy, like painting, or writing, or bricklaying... ...or even soda jerking! Get out! And don't expect any references from me! Gramps? I got my ticket. I'm leaving on the nine o'clock train in the morning. - I'll come up and help you pack. - OK, fine. See you later. - Goodbye. - Hm. Merry Christmas, Mr Quinn. Santa Clauses and reindeers. Heavenly. Brother-in-law. What makes you so far away, Howard? And so nervous? One would think you were becoming engaged. - May I cut in? - Of course, Judge. Thanks, Mrs Pennock. Well, Clarissa, congratulations. You couldn't ask for more in a daughter-in-law - ...young, charming and an heiress. I assure you the money has nothing to do with it. - We love Millicent for her own sweet self. - Of course. Yes? Oh, all right. Thank you. - Was that Mr Norton, Dad? - Huh? I was trying to reach him, but he left town. He won't return till tomorrow morning. What are you going to do? I'll have to ask Mr Pennock for the money, much as I hate to do so. Lester? Excuse me... Charles, must you cut in? You know you don't tango. - No, I don't. I must talk to Lester. - Of course, Charlie. Please forgive me. - Mrs Blaisdell, may I have this dance? - Oh, delighted, Carl. It isn't every woman who gets such a handsome son-in-law. Great party, Charlie. Must've set you back plenty. Howard. - But then, what's money to you? - Read this. "Your account requires $25,000 additional margin." "Deposit immediately." Signed, Franklin Parker Company. - That's too bad. Stock took a drop, huh? - Yes. Well, my advice is to send the money. That petroleum stock will shoot up again. I don't need advice, I need money. I haven't got $25,000. Oh, everybody knows you've got millions. Everybody thinks we have, but we haven't. If I don't get this money, we'll be broke. - Oh, you must be joking. - I wish I were. Since we're to be related, I thought you could advance the money to me. I'll return it as soon as the stock goes up. I wouldn't ask if I didn't know you had it. - $25,000 is a lot. - It's even more when you haven't got it. That's a good one. Oh, you're a card. Well, Lester? What about it? - Why don't you get a loan on this house? - It's already mortgaged. Well, Lester? You had no right to give people the impression you had millions. Is it yes or no? I'm sorry, but since you put it that way, the answer is no. - Oh, Mr Pennock, have you got a pencil? - Pencil? Here. Thank you. - Clarissa. - Yes, darling, what is it? - Have you an invitation? - No, but I must see Mr Blaisdell at once. Wait here. I'll tell him. Why, Mr Smith! Oh, it was sweet of you to come. Hello, Mr Smith! Now I'll have someone to dance with. Like my new dress? It's my first formal. Ah, Roberta, if I were only a good deal younger, or you were a good deal older... I've always wanted to be older. I told him. This way, please. Excuse me. Mr Smith. - Hello, Mr Smith. - You wanted to see me? I've got an important message for you from Mr Edward Norton... ...that lawyer that gave you the money. He was supposed to call me back. Why did he call you? He didn't know you'd sold the store, so he called you there. He remembered me. He must have a remarkable memory. He recalled the entire conversation we had that evening. He even remembered my Tutti-Frutti Delights. - Please, what did he say? - You got a light? Oh, a light. Yes, of course. Here. What did he say? All he did was to ask me to give you a message. - How much are these cigars? - 55 cents. 55 cents? They're no better than Hilverton Stinkers. - For heaven's sake... - Now, what did he say? - Please, try to remember. - I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget. - Oh, it's in my overcoat. - Howard, the coat. Nice of Howard to give me that coat. Keeps me nice and warm. Oh, here it is. Now, he said, "If you spent $100,000 in so short a time... ...you would spend $25,000 in a quarter of the time." Therefore his client must refuse your request. That's all he said. I can't blame him. If you'll forgive me for saying so, neither can I. It seems to me you were much happier before you got that money. Poppa, Mother's about to announce the wedding date! Wedding date? - The Pennocks? - Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, I have a very special announcement to make. The wedding of my daughter Millicent to Mr Carl Pennock... - Harriet... - ... Mr Carl Pennock... - Harriet. - What is it, Charles? - The Pennocks have left. - Left? - Where are they going? - Home, I guess. Why go home in the middle of Millicent's engagement to Carl? Where's Carl? They've left because we're broke. We've lost everything. - Well, what about that stock you bought? - That's what broke us. I'll be lucky to salvage enough from selling this house to buy another store. Another store... - Mother! - Harriet! What's the matter? Daddy, is she OK? Ladies and gentlemen, I have good news to announce. My engagement to Carl Pennock has been called off. Merry Christmas to all of you! - Congratulations! - Thank you. Play something charming. What else could you expect from the nouveau riche? At least their French pastry is better than their manners. So she is in love with that old scoundrel. - I think we'd better leave. - Yes. Here, drink this, Mrs Blaisdell. She doesn't want water, she wants money. To humiliate my daughter in front of all our guests! - Mother, I wasn't. - Well, we had it coming. We did exactly the same to Dan the night we got the money in the old house. The old house! I'd better stop that escrow or we'll have no place to live at all! - Hooray! I can have Penny back! - And I can have Dan! Oh, Mr Smith, I'm so happy I could dance! Hey, Millie! Open the door. - Hey, I can't stand here all day. - I can. Hello, everybody. - Hello, Mr Smith! - Hello, Gramps. - Mr Smith is here. - Glad you decided to come back to us. I just got your old room ready. I'm buying my store back and Dan and I need a soda jerker. Dad's making me a partner. Congratulations. Not only half the work, but half the profit. It'll be just as it was when you first came here. We're back in the old house, Charles has his store, Millicent and Dan are engaged... - And we have no money. - And I doubt we ever will. I doubt it too, but you never can tell. It's not money that makes a person happy, it's what you do with what you have. It's just as well. I'd hate to think I'd have to go through all that again. - Howard, take Mr Smith's bags up. - Never mind, Howard. - I've just stopped in to say goodbye. - Goodbye? Oh, please, won't you stay? I don't think I could love my own grandfather more. Of all the things that have ever been said to me, those words are the nicest. - Guess what! - Aren't you gonna say hello to Mr Smith? Hello, Mr... Mr Smith! I'm so glad you're here. Your painting won first prize in the exhibit for a sur... Oh, whatever. I didn't enter my paintings. I did. I entered the one you did first time we painted together... ...the one that looked so mixed up - and it won first prize! Now we've got a celebrity with us. That's not all. The reporters are coming to talk to him. - To me? What for? - They're gonna take your picture. Well, goodbye. If we never meet again, rest assured I'll think of you constantly. - Aren't you gonna wait for them? - I can't. I'll miss my train. - Well, goodbye, and God bless you all. - Goodbye, Mr Smith. Happy New Year! - Mr Smith live here? - You'll find him inside. If not in body, at least in spirit.
