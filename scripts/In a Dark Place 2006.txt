To the man that I saw. - Who the one is? - Their name is Peter Quint. - As he/she dares? - To that? You made me feel as if it was crazy. Look at me. He is married and he/she has do relate with you? Far from that. For that you didn't tell me the truth? Because the this dead. Peter one hangs after Valerie... After the accident of Ms. Jessel. Thousands and Peter were always together. I believe that Thousands project in the a paternal image. Then Peter Quint and the young lady Was Jessel loving? If he/she could call himself to that love. Carnal passion is as me he/she would call it. What I offered him/her it was a true love. Good... you cannot force somebody to want it. I find it very desirable... Very reliable... And elegant. You are very kind. I speak seriously. I need much of you now. As well as the children. The children? I believe that it was for that reason that Peter Quint returned. I don't believe in ghosts. Wait. Flora made it. Flora knew Peter. I paint of their memories. Not he/she means that she really sees it. I saw it. It is alone a coincidence. Until speaking of that it sounds ridiculous. Do you believe that that Quint is? It seems that Ms. Jessel this here also. Valerie? Undoubtedly not. Me wise that was in the correct thing. Does he/she think that they were being abused? Him you. As? It is for that reason that Thousands it was expelled of the school and because... Flora seems to be afraid the whole time. But like you can to have the certainty? The same thing happened me to my. I sit down it a lot. I have to protect the children. It should be painful to discover this on Quint. For that? Obviously you love him a lot. That? Me... ...I hate Peter Quint with all my heart and my soul. Not I understand. It Was Valerie. My beautiful and dear Valerie. I love Ms. Jessel. It was worried by you. For that was not in their bed? Good, it is hour of returning for yours. You believe that me did he/she walk there outside with fear? No. I believed that somebody was there. Correct. Hour of sleeping, this well? Good night. No!

You go with your brother. This well, will take a bathroom! On the other night... I saw them again. That? Quint and that woman. Valerie. Where? In the lake. They already left. I have the certainty that the children they also saw them. Did the children see them? Did they tell you that? I was there. Well. I will speak with them. No. Not they will count the truth. Take off. They will deny it. Not we can lose them of view. They are quite resolved. Resolved? They want to hurt them. They want to take the children. They want them. You begin to worry, Anna. You that you are sincere and very deliberate. But you don't believe that these taking this too far. What my mother said was. Was it this way? You believe that I am imagining, but if you were mistaken? Then that you suggest that we make? I need to speak with you. You believe that the children are being tormented or abused? Both. Hey, return me that. You believe in God. Then he/she believes in the devil, in the hell and in the lost souls of the convicts. God is tangible. The this to our around. And God is manifested in the beauty of the nature. In the humanity's realizations. You don't believe in the supernatural thing. It was my error. Apologize. Thousands? Thousands? Not I am afraid. Thousands? You know... Alone he/she wanted to understand that this passing with the children. I sit down it, Anna. Not I doubt that he/she worries a lot for the well-being of the children. but anything this very clear one, truth? For that... ...don't you take a rest? Tomato a time to recompose you. All this well. Don't leave. I have to make it. Awake. That it happens? They come quick. I gave that I am imagining now. This well. Thousands? Thousands! For that have made it? It was a joke to scare her. Did you make that to get scared? If. But I could be seeing you. For that reason that Flora was watching over. Was it part of the trap? Anna. As much as time but? A lot but. The posts fell. Not there will be light the rest of the weekend. I will ascend to see as this Thousands. That is my work. If I even have a work, it is that. Undoubtedly you have it.

Not you have been able to sleep? I was thinking. On that? Your. For that didn't speak to me anything on the school? Because there is not anything to count and because this so curious one? For that are so evasive? You will tell me that that this happening and that that this happening here. Not I understand that this speaking. Apologize. Me alone I want to help you... this well?

Not you will believe that her this in the water. Her this arming some thing. Alone? Her alone he/she is a girl. Not this alone one, or if? Do you really believe to see Valerie, it is not this way? I have the certainty. Hello! Hello! Flora? Lover. Shelter you. Where this her? Who? The enchantress young lady Jessel? - Where this hidden one? - Give birth to with that! Not there is nobody here!

Not he/she has any trap, any plot, anything. Valerie or Peter Quint is not attempting to arrive until you or to the children. They are dead, Anna. Do you understand? Dead! They died and they left.
