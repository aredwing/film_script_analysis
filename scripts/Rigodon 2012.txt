Just follow me around... ...let's go out a lot so we can talk about it. Direk, what's the role? You know, you ask too many questions. It's like this. Show me that you're willing to do anything. And then maybe, I might just consider you. Okay? I mean, you're not even a real actor. You just came from a reality show. Hello? At thirty-one, it's hard to find a role for you. I'm a director, not a magician. Hey! Ms. Hannah, please. I hope you would reconsider. I mean, I've been here for three years... ...1 deserve a raise. Rick... ...You know that's not gonna happen. The only thing we can offer you is a regular racket. Isn't that okay? Yes Miss, but it's not enough. I need something more steady. Actually, I've been rejecting offers just to be with you guys. Then that's just too bad. I mean... we don't have any counter offers to give you. But think about it. You're our top host, and it'll be too bad. We don't want to lose you. If I knew that was what you were going to do... ...then I shouldn't have asked that person for a favor! What should I have done, direk? He disrespected me! Damn! Do you think he'll make you famous without anything in return? Direk, I'm not that desperate to sleep with a gay guy. At least... You're not desperate? Then, let me tell you Ricky... ...you'll never become famous! You're already 30. And up to now, you don't have a single fan. And that tongue of yours is twisted!
