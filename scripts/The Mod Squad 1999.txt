He went straight from Beverly Hills to county jail. Lincoln Hayes. He doesn't blame his crimes on anything. Had reasons all his own to burn the world down. Easy, man! Your mother and I have been worried sick, little girl. You gonna have to give it up to Daddy, now. Come on. Hey! Stop! Take this police brutality, baby! Out of my way! All right, I'm gettin' out of here! Dude, relax. Get those skinny leather pants out of here! Go! You little shit. You're gonna get caught. Easy, baby. Why the hackles? - How you doin'? - Okay. Yeah? Can you hear me? Okay. They could've been anybody, no better or worse than the rest. Heading for nowhere. Until I gave them one last chance. - I'm gonna kill those kids. - They're mine. - If anybody does, it's me. - They're screwing with my men. - Is there a problem, fellas? - No. - Workin' late again tonight, huh? - Yeah. Every night, until we find out who stole those drugs from the evidence locker. - IA. - They were just doing their job. Hello, Los Angeles! - Adam-- - They didn't volunteer for this job. - It was my idea. - They're punks. - We're supposed to give them a chance. - Come on! You're gonna side with them? They're not real cops! They can't even carry guns, for God's sakes. Maybe you should spend a little more time worrying about your own guys... - and a little less time-- - What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. These kids can get into a thousand places that we can't. You three really screwed up tonight. Get your feet off that table. Get up! What are you talking about, man? We got the job done. - Yeah, we set the bad guys up, right? - Why don't you shut up and listen. You should be yelling at the cops for beating up kids. You smacked Detective Tricky in the mouth. Do you think this is a joke? You little numb-nut. Okay, Bob, I'll take care of this. Let me take care of this. - Yeah, Bob! - Hey! Sit down and shut up. Sit! You think this is a joke? If you think it's a joke, I'll stick you right back into the cells... where I found you. You're policemen now. Stop screwing around... and start doing your job. If you're gonna start overacting like circus freaks... you might as well be wearin' badges, for crying out loud! Are we done yet? - Excuse me? - Are we done? You're done when I say we're done. - Is that Harry? It looks like him. - All right, everybody. - Listen up. - Save it for the kiddies, Greer. That's pretty funny. All right, tough guy. If you or anybody else has got a problem with my squad... you gotta go through me first. Any takers? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Thanks for asking. Eckford and Lanier aren't here. I got something to do. We'll get started without them. Follow me. You guys see that club down there? We have reason to believe there's a black book operation goin' on inside. - What's black book? - Hookers. Expensive ones. Young girls. We also think the manager, Red Wilson, is involved. Julie, you go inside undercover as a waitress and hopefully get recruited. Why does she always get to be the prostitute? You two will go inside, split up, blend... work the room and keep your eye on this Red character. All right, listen to me. Be nice to these guys. They've been on this case for a while. They're not gonna like working with you. Do what they tell you to and remember to-- - Keep our noses clean? - Exactly. - Sorry we're late, Adam. - Yeah, sorry we're late. - Hey, no excuses, partner. - You're not my partner. We went over the assignments and the background. You guys work out the logistics amongst yourselves. Which one's Eckford and which one's Lanier? Save it. This is our case. We don't want you little pussies playing cop inside. Making our J-O-B all that much harder. You dig? She comes in. Yeah. There you go, little girl. Two grams, asshole. - Call a cop. - Fuck you, pig! Are you okay? - Yeah. - You wanna come back inside? Excuse me. - Listen, I gotta meet up with Greer. - What, now? Yeah, you know how the man is about punctuality. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Keep an eye out for Julie, okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey! How's it goin', girl? You wanna come up to my office after your shift? I've been meaning to ask you if I can work some extra hours. - I can really use the cash. - Yeah, yeah. Well, I, you know-- We'll see what we can do. Huh? You mind if I cut in? Hey, there. How you been? Long time. Yeah. God, what's it been, like three years? I never thought I'd see you again. You look really great, you know? - Can I get you a drink? - Yeah. Can I get a club soda with a lemon? Really? I have two years in July. Right on. Year and a half last month. Really? That's great. You been doin' this long or what? - Sorry. - It's all right. I haven't seen that smile in a long time. So, I guess I should let you get back to work. Yeah. Hey, listen. Can I see you again? Okay. Okay, then? Oh, my God! - Tiffany! - Uh-oh. What "uh-oh"? Okay, wait, wait. Get up! Get the hell out of here! I saw Greer roll up on this cat with leather pants. What? The dude from the bust. I saw Greer pick him up. It was the same guy I saw at the bust last week. - A cop was helping him get away. - Are you sure it was Greer? - Looked like his car. - Every car looks like his car. That's the point of the car. Dude, you're paranoid. Nice job! Okay, I really did not like that at all, all right? Let me just explain somethin'. I was blending. You just blended your ass right out of the club, man. Oh, come on! They're gonna let me back in the club. I believe the words were "you're gone for-fucking-ever." - Greer's gonna kick your ass. - You know what? Eat me. Come on. Let's go. You wanna lose another fight, Petey? Who was the guy that you were talkin' to all night? - What guy? - Yeah, "what guy." A suspect? What? No. I don't even know what he's talkin' about. How could you see anything? You had your head buried in a pair of tits all night. I could see things because I got eyes behind my head, all right? - Julie's got a boyfriend - Please grow up. Let's all together, in harmony. Hey, mommy! Where you goin' with that fine little ass, baby? Why don't you get out in the street and earn a real living, huh? - What? - She digs me. - You have your hall pass, young lady? - You wanna see my hall pass? Yeah, and then I wanna see you in detention. Why do you have to be such a pussy? Leave her alone. Who you callin' a pussy, pussy? - Motherfucker. - Oh, God, you terrify me. - Tricky, just back off, man. - Get outta my face, boy. - What? - Let's go. In my office. Move your ass. In my office. Move your ass! - Where were you last night? - Excuse me? You left me out on the street for, like, an hour. I was doin' something. I'd love to know what you were doin' while I was out there waitin'. - It's a police matter. - What's a police matter? - Shut your face. - Why don't you try stealin' drugs... - from the evidence locker? - What? What'd you say? Stealin' drugs from the evidence locker. You better watch what you say and who you're saying it to. - Let me tell you something, Linc. - Save it. Shut up and listen to me. One of these days, you'll wake up and be 30. Who knows? Maybe even 40. Get up when I talk to you. Get up. And you're gonna be alone, all alone. You're gonna realize not everybody in this world is your enemy. I'm trying to do my job. I suggest you do the same and quit breaking my balls. It's enough already. Get off my desk, please. - Is there any luck at the club? - Look, Captain. We're just trying to get really, really deep undercover. Yeah. - The manager's a real creep. - Yeah? And? It feels like there's definitely something going on in there. I don't care about feelings. This isn't a feelings business. Get some evidence. You're on the roof with Eckford and Lanier. Take off those stupid sunglasses and do what you're told. Yes, sir. There are people breathing down my neck to get rid of all three of you. - What'd we do? - Arson, assault and robbery. Now, get out. And remember, I'm the only thing keeping you clowns out of prison. - Man, this job sucks! - Beats jail. A deal's a deal. - What the hell? - Dude, they're not there. - What are you doin' in here? - Eckford and Lanier. What? They never showed. Give me the keys. - The keys to what? - I got no car. This is a stakeout. - Are you crazy? Hell no. - Come on! This is a cop thing. You can't just leave me standing there like an asshole. - I swear to God, man. One scratch-- - All right. - What can I get you, slick? - I'll take a malt liquor, sister. I need you to find out everything you can about this guy over there... with the blonde hair and leather pants in the booth. Is he your guy? Yeah. All right. I'll see what I can do. - What? - It's so freaky to see you again. - Freaky? - Yeah. - Maybe it's just the hair. I don't know. - My hair? I wanna say that I'm sorry about what happened before. About not calling and disappearing like that. - I was an asshole. - Forget it. It was a long time ago. - We were both really fucked up. - Yeah, I know, but I'm sorry. - I'm sorry that I hurt you. - Forgiven. It's over. We're movin' on. What are you doin' in this place other than keeping me from my job? Take a break? Now? - Just to talk. - Yeah. You can page me if you need to talk to me. See ya! - Bye, Gilbert. - Let's go. You can do this later. How are you doin'? - I'm all right. - Are you here with someone? - No. - Would you like to be? Maybe later. I gotta go. Not really goin' for waitress of the month, are you? Apparently not. I missed you. - Hey, there. - Hi. Whoa, whoa. I thought we were just gonna talk. Oh, please. Hey, my man! Okay, give me the keys. Give me the keys! Gilbert, no, man. I'm giving you a ride. That's enough. Give me the keys. - Be careful. - Always. - Pop the trunk. - Why? Because it's cold and buggin'. I want my jacket. Okay, Gilbert? Put on your jacket and let's go! - Ah, man! - "Ah, man" what? - Hey. - Cops! Cops? Shit! Get the car! Shit! Shit, shit, shit! Come on, man! Sorry! Who's your friend? Look, man, I was just giving him a lift, man. That's all. Where? Just under the Sixth St. bridge. That was all. I was just gonna take him under the Sixth St. bridge! His name's Gilbert O'Reilly. I told him I'd give him a ride. I was, like, designated driver. You know, like a car pool. I'll take you to where he lives. Okay, you want a car wash? I work at the Valley Car Wash. I'll give you a free car wash... on the-- Julie, someone said they saw you come in here. - What? - What are you doing in here? What do you think I'm doing, Red? I've been lookin' for you all night. You're not supposed to be in the VIP. Finish up and get your ass back down to work. Oh, my God. - I guess I should get back to work. - Oh, really? Yeah. You can stay up here, if you want. - You know what? I have to go. - Oh, okay. - I have to go to this club. - That's cool. Look. Here's my number. You call me. I mean it. Whenever you need anything, anytime, please. - Okay? - It's nice talking to you. It's nice talking to you too. - See you. - See you. Oh, God. Linc, I can't believe it, man. I mean, I can't-- I mean, I can't believe it, man. Dude-- If people could learn to drive in this city! I'm gonna call my lawyer friend, all right? No, no, no. Where you goin'? I gotta tell Jules we're goin'. What about that guy? I caught the guy. He talked, and I let him go. All right. You sure about this, Linc? Look, the dude said the guys are meeting a cop under this bridge. Greer's got nothin' to do with drugs, man. He helped me get sober, you know? Could you have parked further away? - Precautions, man. - Paranoid, man. Oh, my God. It's Greer. Oh, man. Oh, my-- Oh, my God. I mean, I can't believe it. Is that cocaine? So, what do we do? We gotta get the hell out of here. I'm not gonna just leave him here. What are you talkin' about? Let's go. Wait, wait, wait. We're cops, all right? We're on the scene. This is our job. All right? We're not that kind of cops, man. We gotta go now! Come on! You all right? I can't believe he's dead. They're gonna think we were in on it. They're gonna come for us. Why would they come for us? Because we're in the clubs, Pete. We're his kids. Greer wasn't like that. It was a setup. All right, look. You were sick. We were giving you a lift home. That's why we left the club. Okay? All right? Okay. Show time. I'm Detective Briggs, Internal Affairs. I just got a few questions for you. Okay. - Tell me where you were tonight. - I don't know. We sent a car over to the club. - None of you were there. - Julie was sick. - How are you doing, Julie? - I'm all right. - What was wrong? - I don't know. Do I look like a doctor? I said she wasn't feeling well. No, I was in the-- I was in the bar. - No work tonight? - I had an upset stomach... so I left work early, and Pete and Linc drove me home. No, no, no. I was outside the bar. You guys must be gettin' pretty tight. - Not really. - Not really? Julie got sick in the bar, and I had to take her home. I went in the bar to get Linc, 'cause I can't drive Linc's-- - So you just took off? - Eckford and Lanier, they left too. - Where were Eckford and Lanier? - I don't know. - Ask me a question. Anything you want. - Where were you when Greer got shot? What? - Greer's dead? - Sorry. Two shots to the chest. It looked like something exploded. You know what you're doin'? You're tryin' to play on my emotions right now. That's what you're tryin' to do. I know this whole game. I know-- - What do you know? - I don't know anything. Except that we found drugs on the scene. Cocaine. We're running tests. We think it may be the stuff from the evidence locker. You look a little nervous, Pete. Something you wanna tell me? - You know anything about drugs, Julie? - Enough to stay away. Do I need to call a lawyer? Not yet. But we may need you for additional questioning... so don't go anywhere. - Were you crying? - No! How are you holding up? We're fine. Well, they're suspending the unit, pending further investigation. - What did Briggs tell you? - Nothin'. Our captain's dead, they don't know what happened and they found drugs on him. They think they're from the evidence locker. Every man's gotta make a living, right? Shut up. You didn't even know him. He was a great cop. Shut up! A little too much coffee. Oh, baby. Look, um-- I'm gonna do what I can to get you back on. And I'm gonna do it because it's what Adam Greer would've wanted. But you're gonna have to lay low... for a while, so-- I can't believe I'm doin' this. This is my address and home phone. If you need anything. Thanks. He was my friend. Since when's he so friendly? - Since maybe his best friend just died. - So what. So what? - You're an asshole. Greer was-- - Greer was what? You're actin' like this guy was your best friend. He wasn't your daddy. Fuck you! You guys wanna play like this doesn't matter, like you don't care? Fine, I'm out. This is Billy. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. You ready to get to the bottom of this? What do you mean? Well, for starters, we gotta find that guy with the leather pants. So, what-- How do you think we're gonna do that? I know a friend of his. - For me? - Is what for you? - The fish? - For you. Thank you. Can I come in? Yeah, I'm sorry. Of course. - Your address was listed, so-- - I'm so proud to have one. You sounded so depressed on the message. I thought I'd come by and cheer you up. Thank you. God, I must look like shit. I've been asleep all day. - That's not possible. - Yeah, actually. - I'm sorry. Whoops. - It's all right. It's okay. That the perp's place, bro? - Yeah. - Stop, bro. - Stop, stop. - What? I think I should drive in and make the collar. Are you crazy? Man, you're lucky I let you ride in the car. Dude, the guy knows what you look like, all right? So? Dude, your cover's been blown, all right? Your cover's been blown. Your cover has been blown. All right? I gotta do it. That's it. Dude, I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna bring him out. Bro, I'm still under. I got it. Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! Stop! Police! Hey! Somebody grab that guy! Grab that guy! Goddamn it! Look, I told you, man, that's not even my stuff, okay? It's some-- What? I was just giving Gilbert a ride to meet some cop. It was just a car pool situation. That's not a crime. Just savin' gas. Dude, I'm sorry about the car. He was gettin' away. I mean, what do you want me to do? - Dude, it's just water. - Save it! Look, where's leather pants live? - Who? - Gilbert O'Reilly. Look, are you guys really cops? - 'Cause my boss is just-- - Dude, we're undercover. Really? What'd he do, anyway? Dude, we think he killed our boss, all right? Would you shut up? Yeah, shut up, man! - You keep tickling me. - Hold still! I gotta concentrate. Come on! - You're being-- What're you doin'? - I gotta go. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. I gotta go. Why? I gotta go meet my sponsor. You're gonna wear my lipstick? This is my address, okay? And next week, I'm gonna cook you dinner. Since when do you know how to cook? I have a week. I'll learn. - See you. - See you. - Watch the car. - Sorry, man. - Sure he lives here? - Yeah. You know, he's a surfer guy, so he likes to be near the water. Knock? I don't think he's home. Stand back. Stand back! Oh, shit. What the hell is wrong with you, man? - Bro, stand back. - Where'd you get that from? Dude, it's my dad's. Oh, yeah. You know how to use it? Bro, you just point and shoot. Look, just don't point and shoot at me. You know what? No guns, okay? - Guns are bad. - Shut up! - I know a guy once-- - Shut up! Do a perimeter search, all right? Cover me. - With what? - Cover me. Are you nuts? All right. What do we do now? - We wait. - Cops wait. Hello? I think I have the wrong number. - Hello? - Who's this? - Who's this? - Who's this? I told you not to pick up the fuckin' phone! Hello. Yellow Cab. Can I get a cab over at Hollywood and Vine? - Pull over here. - All right. Here you go. Well? - Hold on. Wait a second. - All right. Follow that Caddie. You got it. - Here you go. - Keep the change. Come on. Do some business with me. Do you see I'm busy? - Leave me alone. - It'll just take a couple minutes. I'll leave you alone as soon as we deal with this in the back with some privacy. - You're driving me crazy. - All right. Shut up! I love you, sweetheart. You know, you're a pain in the ass. - Come on. - You're a pain in the ass! Yeah, but you love me. I'm a pain in the ass, but you love my ass. You're making me laugh. You wanna make a big deal with me? I know you got something goin' down... with one of your bands and drugs-- You leave the fuckin' boys outta this! - They can really rock and roll. - What? This is a joke, right? You are a pimp, Billy. A pimp. You do drugs. That doesn't mean you should sell 'em. Just say no, man. Just tell me when and where it's goin' down and I will bring the cash, okay? You wanna be a big shot? You wanna make the big fuckin' deal? Okay, you're in. But you better not mess with me or I'll crush your balls. - I would not mess with you. - Or the band. They really got a future. - Okay, okay. Can I use your phone? - Who are you gonna call? I'm gonna call the cops, Howard. Funny, very funny. Keep it local. Bob? Hey. Yeah, I just talked to him. Deal's set. You relax, Bob. None of them have any idea that I know they're cops. Especially her. Look, I'm her goddamn dream man, okay? No, you listen to me! If you wanna have somebody else take a shot... like Tricky or one of the other men in blue that-- The what? All right. I gotta go. Something's come up. I gotta go. Bye. - Wow. - Hi, baby. - Is this for me? - Mm-hmm. Really? Come here. Dude, I think there's something down there, bro. - What? - I don't know. Wait! I hear some voices down there. - It's the ocean. - Wait. No, listen. Get back in the car. Get back in the car. No, I will shoot you. - Get back in the car. - All right. Let's go. Be quiet, Gilbert. All right? Sit down! Bye, Gilbert. Man, I thought I told you, no guns. My ankle! Shit! Oh, Jesus. Who's this? - Beats me. - Come on. Let's dump him in the trailer with Gilbert. I gotta go. I gotta get out of here. All right? - Where are you goin', man? - I don't know, man. I just gotta go, all right? What are you gonna do, hit me? - Yeah, right. - Don't be stupid, Pete. You're callin' me stupid? I got a fucked up ankle. I got brain and blood all over my body. And I'm fuckin' stupid. You know what? Fuck you! You know what, man? You wanna leave? Go ahead, my man. Matter of fact, take my keys. I don't give a shit. His head just exploded, like, all over the place, all over everything. All over my clothes, my face, all over-- And then I dropped Linc off at home... and then I left, you know, and I just-- I needed someone to talk to about this whole situation. I don't want that anymore. Tough night, Pete. It's gonna be okay. I want you to go home, and I want you to get some rest. I'm gonna take care of this for you. I don't know how, but I'm gonna do it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you so early. I hope I didn't wake you up or disturb your wife or anything. My wife. So did you get a look at these two guys? Hello. - Yeah. - What? What did they look like? Yeah. I never said that there were two-- No, no. All right. Have a good time. No, I think it was too dark... for me to see anything. Listen. I have to take this call in the other room. It's my wife. Oh, yeah. Can't you understand I'm tied up? Not here. Am I speaking French to you? What the hell? Not the yard! - Hey, leave a message after the beep. - Hey, Linc, you didn't say our na-- Linc, if you get this message, do not go back to the apartment. There's cops all over the place. Just meet me and Julie down at that place at the beach tomorrow morning. Hi, Mom. What's happened to you? Well, you know, things are pretty fucked up, Ma. Don't use that foul language with me. Who is it, honey? Hi, Dad. What do you want? Let me get you some clean clothes, okay? Well, I was-- - I was just-- You know, I just-- - We're not bailing you out. What? What do you mean, you're not bailing me out? The police already came by. What? No, no. The police are in on it, Dad. - Come on. Save it. - No, listen to me. Just for a second. I'm a police officer now, Dad. - Oh, you're a police officer? - Yes, I'm a police officer. Here we go. Some clean clothes, honey. - Now clean up. You're a mess. - I don't need clean clothes right now. - They're his. - Officer Pete? Why are you laughing at me? Officer Pete. Betty, you know, at least he got a haircut. Maybe when they make him captain, they'll give him a uniform. Why don't you just give him a chance? I'm sorry about your guy. He wasn't my guy. Well, I guess not. He's a pimp. He's not sober. And on the phone he was saying something about Tricky. The guy was playing with me the entire time. Well, I think everything's gonna be okay. You think? It just feels good to say it. - Good night. - Good night. If you need to go to a meeting... tomorrow morning... then I can go down to the pier by myself. No, it's okay. Thanks. Would you just hold me? Thanks for being here. You too. Damn, Sonny, what took you so long? I was waitin' out there forever. What, I don't get no "Hello. I miss you. Sorry I didn't call your ass until I needed some shit"? What happened to you? What's with the fishin' hat? I'm tryin' to stay on the undercover, man. Penitentiary life ain't good for a brother, is it? You got the info or what, man? Your man Gilbert O'Reilly was dealin'. What you mean "was"? It was on the news. They found him at the beach with another dude, both dead. Cops said it was a murder-suicide. I think it was some S-M shit myself. All right, look, Sonny, man. I'm gonna need to borrow your car. Hell, no. You might be named after Lincoln who freed the slaves... but I ain't about to free my wheels up, man. I got some shit goin' down tonight. I could use a partner like the old days, you know? - Don't waste your breath. - You know you can run now. - Sonny. - Track star! Just consider this my way of keeping your skinny ass out of a life of crime. Don't save me from a life of crime, man. Crime pays. Well. Did you ever break-dance when you were in school? - I imagine you did, though. - I can break-dance. Disgusting. I'm like a ladies' man. I love to dance. Knock it off. - What? - Looking. Oh, come on. Oh, man! What did you do to my car, man? - Oh, shit. - Look at this. - What did you do to my goddamn car? - Linc, wait. Wait. Okay. Just don't say anything for a second. Let me just explain it. Let me just explain it, all right? - He said something about a big deal. - Jules, it makes total sense, man. Last night I stopped in on a friend. Got the car, some clothes, and I got some information. Turns out that Gilbert was Tricky's snitch. Here you go. I didn't know if you wanted cream or half and half or sugar or Equal or-- Black's fine. It's fine. - All right. - Did I miss something? - You sure? - Yes. Check it out. All right. Here's what we got. Now Billy's workin' something, runnin' with the men in blue. And Gilbert definitely didn't take out the bald guy... so he probably didn't cap himself either. So since Gilbert was Tricky's snitch, he's hooked in too. And whoever stole the drugs from the evidence locker... was trying to frame Captain Greer. Wait. No, I didn't hear anything you guys just said. The cops, man-- Tricky, Eckford, Lanier, the whole gang-- They're all into something. No. Mothershed. When I was at his house, he said there were two guys. - And I never even said that. - Yeah, right. Whatever they got goin' got something to do with Billy, Gilbert and drugs. This is like one of those dirty cop drug things. This shit really happens? - Looks that way. - And Greer was onto him. That's why there was all that secret stuff before he died. That's why he died. He was trying to protect us. Yeah. So what now? You know, we need to get some evidence. We need some evidence. Just trust me. They all gotta meet up and go over the plan. - Really? - Look, these stupid motherfuckers... are nothin' if not predictable, man. - So how long do we do this? - Till something happens. Is this all that cops do-- sit around in cars, waiting? We can go get some doughnuts. I gotta pee. What did I tell you? Looks like that's all of 'em. - I'm goin' in. - What? Pete, your ankle's all messed up. I'm good at this. Don't worry. We'll all go. No. It's too much noise. Don't worry about it. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I got it. You really think he can pull this off? That's it. We don't want no more to do with this. Come on, Carl. Don't be such a pussy. - Don't call me a pussy. - Fuck you, motherfucker. - See what this thing is doing to us? - What? - We out of here. - Ah, shit. Come on, Carl. Come here. - This was supposed to be about drugs. - Two people are dead. - Three. - What? - The bald guy at Gilbert's. - Couldn't be helped. Look, Gilbert was an asshole. Almost gettin' arrested at the bust... not stayin' away after we fired him, talkin' to Greer. Little shit deserved to die. - Why did you have to kill Greer? - He knew about us and the drugs, okay? Got in the way. - This is bad. I want out. - Yeah, me too. It's too late for that, Carl. Come on. This is our lives, asshole. Now, you wanna get in our way, you take your best shot. But I ain't guaranteein' where you'll end up. Ernie, come on. Put it down, man. We're all in this to the end, right? If this deal goes through, we're set for life. Come on. So what's the plan? Over here. I'm wet. Come on. All right. Here it is. Billy set up a big deal with this rock manager Howard. - You sure we can trust this Billy guy? - Yeah. He did a good job sellin' the drugs after we got rid of Gilbert. And this new deal is his idea anyhow. You see, this Howard guy-- he's got some famous rock band... flyin' in, and the drugs are on the plane. - Who's the band? - How should I know who the band is? It's just voices on a tape, man. To hell with voices on a tape. We bring this to IA. That's it. Pete, Linc's right. They're not gonna believe it. Look. We can't trust anybody, all right? It's just us. Oh, God. Okay, so-- Then, wh-- Sorry. What do you wanna do? I know where the rock manager lives. We have to find out when and where it's happening. Fine. I'll go over there, I'll get tight with them, and I'll find out something. You can't do that, 'cause if Billy's there, you're dead. He can make us. I got Billy. - Are you sure? - Anybody got a better idea? Then I got your back, Julie. All right. Leave a message at home and let us know what's goin' on, all right? All right. Let's do it. Where you been? I called your house. I called the club. - They said you're not working anymore. - I quit. I'm not a very good waitress. What happened? Did I do something wrong? No, everything's fine. No, I was looking for you too. You were lookin' for me too? Yeah. Well, here I am. What? Says Billy sent him over. There. Sit down. Oh, I'm so sorry about the mess. - I'm redecorating. Yeah? - I know you told me to stay in there. Can I get a soda? - Soda. I'm thirsty. - You're thirsty. I'm sorry. My little baby is thirsty. Come here. I'm sorry. This is not gonna take very long, okay? All right. You go ahead. You go get yourself a fuckin' sodie. Not bad, huh? You want a fuckin' sodie too? - I'm cool. - Yes. Yes, you are. You are cool, aren't you? So? You're movin' a lot of shit. Billy thought you might need some help. Sweet little Billy. But nice to know he cares. Okay, now. If I'm out of line here, you just let me know, okay? Or storm off or do whatever. I got us a room. Right on. - Could I borrow the phone? - Sure. Just dial nine to get out. - Leave a message after the beep. - Hey, Linc, you didn't say our-- - You have no messages. - Thank you. Wanna dance? What? Come on. Dance with me. I love this song. Come on. It's just a little dance. I'm not a fag. I just like to dance. Uh, you lead. I'll be the girl. Yeah. I should get goin', man. I got some business to handle. You're a classy dancer, you know that? Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute. I forgot. What's your name? Spin me, Linc. What? I said spin me. We could enter a contest. You can ride with us in the morning, okay? Come on. Okay, I got it. Agua Dulce Airport. Yeah. Don't worry about it. Bob, she's fine. She doesn't know a thing. Don't worry about it. You fuckin' woke her up, man. I didn't do him, okay? What about Linc? Oh, he didn't leave a message. We gotta go. Are you sure about that? I overheard him say that on the phone in the bathroom. And that piece of paper I found in his pants said Aqua Dulce Airport. Jesus. Dirty cops, drops at the airport. I feel like one of us should say we're gettin' too old for this shit. At least it's not goin' down in an abandoned warehouse. Yeah. You gotta hear these guys. They can really rock, man. I mean, this band can rock and roll. These boys are the bomb. All right. I'm gonna go make a phone call. - What? - Just stay here, all right? Let's go greet the fuckin' kids. Be nice to the boys, okay? - Hey! Kevin, how are you, baby? - Howie! Hey, Kirk! Kris, how you doin', babe? How are you? Oh, come on! Will ya pl-- Hey, will you turn down the tunes a scootch, please? Thanks. Listen, boys. Big people got some biz here. So why don't you hop into the limo... scoot over to the hotel, we'll catch up with you later. - Come on. Can't we stay with you? - Come on. Be good, boys. - We won't do anything. - Give us a hug. Come on. - Go ahead. Go! - Bye! See you at the hotel. - Don't be long. - We missed you. Where the hell is that schmuck? Where'd you go? I called for backup. - What's goin' on? - Linc's inside. God, that almost is an abandoned warehouse. I'm gettin' too old for this shit. - Oh, my God. - Shit. Oh, God. Okay. - Hey, you guys got a bathroom in here? - Over there. - You're late. - Sorry. I had to rent a car, man. Someone stole mine from your party the other night. What do we do? - Let's go. - What? Where? Get the car. Come on. Let's go. - Oh, God. - You want me to drive? No. Linc wouldn't want you driving his car. So, do we do this now... or do we wait for your boyfriend to come out of the toilet? What? Your fella. He's a good dancer. Dancer? I don't know no dancer. Are you serious? I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about. Uh-huh. No, brother's not with me. - He's a cop. - What? - Stop messin' around. - You'll know when I am. He's a cop! - Police! - Freeze! - Drop the weapons! - Drop 'em! - Right now! Drop 'em! - Put 'em down! Down! Drop 'em! Get 'em out of here! - Come on, big man. - Hey, this is fucked up. Faster. Teamwork. Let's go. Get out of here. You too, home skillet. On the wall. Spread 'em! You dead, boy. Stop! Is that Eckford? - He better move. - Right on. - Jump! - What? Jump! - Oh, my God! My ankle! - Get away from the door! Hey, kid, I don't think you're gonna make it. - Fuck this fair fighting shit. - Okay. - You okay? - Yeah, man. Gotta go. I got a plan. Does this mean you're mad at me again? You gonna kill him? No, I'm done. Hey, what are you doing, huh? I've got nothing to do with drugs. I'm in the music business! Hey, get this place taped off. You're standing around like crossing guards. - Save me a dance, lover. - What happened, Detective? Well, sir. We were bustin' 'em, and these kids came in and tried to stop us. - That's bullshit. - They tried to stop you? Yes, sir. Probably in on it too. - They set this up. - They stole drugs from the evidence. - That's enough. Get 'em out of here. - They killed Greer. He was onto them. Ask him. I have no idea what she's talking about. Ask him. Right before Billy hands over the cash, we roll in and make the bust, okay? - Where are we gonna get that money? - Carl, there is no money, okay? It's an empty bag. We bust in before Billy hands it over. Anybody have any questions? It's all pretty easy. We grab the drugs, pretend to arrest Billy... next day he's out moving the stuff for us, okay? Yeah, Bob! Assume the position. Assume it. You all right? - Yeah, are you? - Yeah. You? Yeah. Nice work. Thank you. So you kids are what... some kind of "mod squad" or something? They say we're back on if we want. - Yes. - Won't be the same without Greer. What else we got? - So what? Are we in or-- - Right on. Solid. Oh, Linc, dude. I know a guy down in Torrance... who is, like, the straight up wizard of bondo. - And I'm sure he could fix up the car-- - Shut up, Pete. No, wait. I'm serious, dude. No, this guy's like a bondo king. I'm sure he can slap that Lincoln together in no time, right? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna call my lawyer friend... to file a lawsuit against those guys or the city or somebody, right?
