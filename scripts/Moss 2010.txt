The Devil is close by, always out to get you. The Day of Judgment is near. This is insane. l run this place on small subsidies and offerings from our sisters. But since he came here, the well's run dry. Be frank. You mean he's raking in all the cash, right? Nothing gets by you, Detective. Want me to throw him in jail? For life! Who am l to forgive? We can all attain forgiveness. Goodness consoles us in pain. The pharmacist in town's looking to sell his land. How's $3 per square meter? Bring it down to $2. Believe in your goodness. Remember everyone. Your faith starts right here. You bastard! Sweet talking 'em! Then racking up all their money! Shit. KlM So-chul, $550. HAN Man-ok, $700. LEE Nan-jung, $460. KlM Gan-nan, $320. KlM Mak-nae, $280. CHUN Soo-man, $240. GO Deok-soo, $460. They asked me to buy land with that to build a place to live. They said you took the money! They didn't give it to you! The director must've forced them. Ask my brothers and sisters. They all signed an agreement with the director. Every one of their signatures is there! Give it up and return the money. Let us pray. That stubborn bastard. Did he make a lot? Don't think so. He came back from Vietnam. Heard he killed someone there during the war. After that he just stayed Made better money. He's married and has a son, too. Why'd he come here? Says he wants to repent for his sins in Vietnam. He started eating only natural food. Then he went into isolation and didn't budge for weeks. Says he read the Bible 50 times. Why are they following that man around? Thought l was good with people... But RYU is really something. The way he looks at the people who've sinned... lt's so peaceful and comforting. Man, you fell for it, too? Hell no! But almost. l realized it's the Devil's doing. A petty thief steals meaningless things, but the Devil takes the heart. So they started handing over money, land, everything! To him! Really? He won't last long in there. Detective CHUN asks if you wanna talk, now. You don't? Son of a bitch! Stop! Wait! ls he dead? He's not moving. Welcome. Ah, thank you. Keeping that bastard in check? Yes, but there's a problem. Why aren't you doing as l ordered? Didn't you hear? l sent three tons of rice to your father! Fool! l know. Take 'em back, sir. Just don't make me do this. Please, sir. Drop it, sir. l can't do it. Anyone who hurts Mr. RYU is sure to go to hell. Are you crazy! What's so special about him! A petty thief steals things, but the Devil takes the heart. How the hell does he steal people's hearts? You're really something. A master at winning people over. The director will surely be judged. You're planning something, aren't you? Of course not. Everything is be judged. lf anything happens to him... You'll die in there. Shouldn't you worry about saving yourself first? Fear will save you. l'll rip that mouth off! How did you convince the fools in here they'll be saved? l didn't save or help anyone. They realized that on their own. One question. Judgment, you say? You're talking the bastards into helping you get revenge, right? Am l on your hit list, too? Tell me. Just curious, that's all. May l ask you for a favor? The hell! l'll shoot you! Do l look like one of your henchman! Son of a bitch. So, what's the favor? Young-ji? She's probably in the park. Are you Young-ji? Young-ji? Yes. Can l borrow your Bible to look up something? Page 1 15. Exodus Chapter 21 , verses 24 and 25. Exodus... Oh, here it is! Chapter 21 ... Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. The Bible's a killer! That's justice! What's this? PARK Chil-gu, RYU Jung-dae, NA Pan-su, AHN Tae-jun PARK Chil-gu, RYU Jung-dae, NA Pan-su, AHN Tae-jun PARK Chil-gu, RYU Jung-dae... They're the bastards? They raped Young-ji, got her pregnant, then chased her out of town. What do l do with them? Teach them a lesson. Please! No! We're sorry! Don't be. Men can do that. Please! No! You threw a newborn baby in this river so this'll do. - Rip their balls off! - Sure thing. You bastards! Bastards. Bastards. Please! No! The hell? l am a henchman. Shit. That won't do anything to their balls! You didn't even touch it? lt's made especially for you. A heavy body clouds the mind. Then, you succumb to sin. You really are something. Thank you for doing the favor. Forget it. l thought you were just a con-man at first. You're no god. l thought you tricked folks out of their money. But l was wrong. Your methods may be different, but you have a sense ofjustice. l've been a detective for 20 years. l've caught and locked up all kinds of criminals. But some bastards never change. They get out, sin again, then l throw 'em back in. Shit! l'm sick of it! Mr. RYU? Let's get you out of here. How about us taking 'em... The bastards with nowhere to go, and living with 'em? The salvation you talk about... lsn't it something like this? With you there, l think l can do it. People who want to be born again... Are there really people who want to be born again? Of course. MOSS Sir! ls he dead? Looks like it. Flip his eyelids. He's dead for sure. Hello? Hello, Prosecutor PARK Min-uk. Who's this? Oh, RYU Hae-guk! l heard you got transferred. All thanks to you, l'm working out in the country. Sorry to hear that. l hear there's no glory for you either, Mr. RYU. You lost your job and split with your wife. Sorry to hear that. Still keeping tabs on me? Remember, if you do anything wrong, l'll always find out. Why'd you call? Let me ask you something. How humble of you. Go ahead. Tell me one thing. Son of a bitch. Tell me honestly. You know l didn't do anything wrong! You know what moss is? Live quietly like the moss stuck on a rock. Leave your cell phone on and know that l'm always watching you. And make a mistake. The sooner the better. You really are hopeless. Hello? Hello? Hey! Since when did l become the offender? Then why didn't you settle when l told you? l had to work this past holiday cuz of you! Your face says you're an offender! Especially those eyebrows! No need to investigate you! Sorry, Mr. Prosecutor. Let's see who's the real offender now. Wait! l can easily make you the perpetrator. - Why? - So let's just settle. Why should l settle when l didn't do anything wrong? The law is not always fair. Your face tells me you're an offender! Especially those eyebrows! No need to investigate you! Think of it as going on vacation to a nice, quiet place. Mr. RYU's son is coming. - Son? - He had a son? Hello. What? His son. His son's here? How did he know? Welcome. - l'm the village chief. - l see. Nice to meet you. l'm RYU Hae-guk. Go on in. Yes, sir. Looks just like his dad. Ah, no. Completely different. Shouldn't you check and see? Right... His son's here. Carry on with the funeral. Hello. Enjoy the food. What's this? How can you just die like this? l'm not even sad for you. l just finished my duty. So, don't resent me. Even l didn't resent you. Come here. Yes, sir. Have a seat, here. You should eat something. Here, have a drink. l don't drink, sir. Mr. RYU couldn't drink either. You can't drink or don't want a glass from me? l'll take it, sir. Good. lf a man offers you a drink, you take it. Pour me a drink, Seoul man. Sure. A special drink poured by a man from Seoul! Me, too? Sure. Would you like a drink, Chief? Sure. Heading back right after the burial? Of course. What's here for him to do? They don't mourn for years at the grave like in the past. Of course not. Seoul folks will be too bored to last a day here. lt's not so bad here. Ah, Seoul's better. Of course. Drink up. Here's to Mr. RYU going to a better place. And to his son's success in Seoul. Thank you. You saw to everything, Chief. Not much for us to do. - Go home safely. - Take care, sir. Go on. Wait! Excuse me! Ah... Aren't you going to verify his death? lt's already done. By who? The Chief. Without a doctor's examination? The Chief got that by phone this afternoon. By phone? The procedures are pretty easy for deaths due to old age. But shouldn't you at least see to basic procedures? Dr. KlM? Can you come by tomorrow? Come and write up a death certificate. A man died. We should do what we can. See to procedures. Right. Bye. Happy? Ah, yes. Looks normal. - Everything ready for the burial? - Yes. We can just go up. When are you going back to Seoul? Why do you ask? Just wondering. l'll write up the death certificate. Pick it up later. Yes, sir. What is the cause of death? Why did he die? Why? You think someone killed him? Why do you ask that? lsn't it normal for me to ask if he was sick or something? Oh, come on! Stop asking so many questions! What are you a detective! Wanna cut him up? And do an autopsy? Come on. Stop it. There's no reason for his death. You can check if you want. Just my opinion. Good job. Thank you, Chief. When's the last time you saw him? You acting up cuz you have a clue as to how he lived? You're making everyone feel like they sinned. What good does it do to try and be a good son now? Right. What good now. Mr. RYU! No! Stomp it down hard. Says he needs a place to stay. Temporarily? Just until he organizes Mr. RYU's belongings. Then he says he'll leave? Not sure. What if he doesn't leave? Hae-guk can't stay here, right? Can anyone live here? Of course not. We should send him back. Tell the store to give him a room. The store? - The food's good there. - Thank you. Are you going back after organizing his things? Why does it matter to you where l go? lt's just people are uncomfortable with a city folk hanging around. l'll lay low. Don't worry. Even if a dog comes in, it makes a difference! Not that l'm calling you a dog. Hey, l haven't seen a dog around here for a while. Hello? Anybody home? l'm sorry. l didn't mean to startle you. Will you be using this room? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. So handsome. Pardon? Kidding. Have a good rest. SlTE CANNOT BE SHOWN Damn, there's no lnternet. Then l'm not paying rent. Young-ji? lt's me. l'm starving. Sleep tight. Damn dog makes a big difference. Shit. All done. Here you are. RYU Mok-hyeong Deceased Land Register Majeri 442-1 Owned by RYU Mok-hyeong Changes in registration Majeri 442-1 Sold by RYU Mok-hyeong Majeri 442-1 Bought by CHUN Yong-duk Dang, son! Don't buy this! lt's all in the village warehouse. Worried l won't leave till l use this all up? This is good. lt's not at the warehouse. - Take Visa? - Of course. Sir? Mr. RYU's son was just here. Really? What did he try to buy? This and that. l only let him take a sensor light. ls he trying to settle down here? Good work. Try again! Shared land ownership Can you find out what he's searching? Of course. That's pretty easy, sir. Copy everything he searched after he leaves. Leave a record of the history. Yes, sir. l will. What? He erased all his lnternet search files? Pretty cautious kid. Take out the hard drive and give it Officer CHUN. He'll find a way to check. Wow! What a feast! What's taking him? There he comes! Come here! Hurry! Yes, sir. Have a seat, sir. lt's a farewell dinner after all your troubles here. Have a seat. Looks like Young-ji's the saddest to see him go. Don't eat too much, sirs. Aw, come on! - Eat lots, handsome. - Thank you. But l'm not leaving. l'm not going to Seoul. Look Seoul man. City folks can't live in a place like this. People have roots in different places. You can't just move your roots. Just go back home! Mr. RYU lived here, but this isn't your hometown. ls there a reason why l can't stay here? What will you do for a living? l'll live at my father's house and farm or something. You think farming's a joke? This ain't a place for just any old bum! Don't even think about coming to your dad's memorial next year! Well, maybe on Thanksgiving... Live here then. lt's nice and quiet. You'll get used to the place. Right! Anyone can farm if they want. We got good machines. Let's eat up! Yes, sir. Fresh air and everything. l've been starving all day. Bastard RYU l told you not to call me. l'm hanging up. Wait! Please, hear me out! Something's fishy about my father's estate. Shouldn't a prosecutor ask what's fishy? Let's say l did. My dad owned a great deal of land. Congratulations! Never would've guessed. But all the land was registered at once. If he sold it, the money should be in his account. But there's not a dime left in his account. So? What's strange about that? An old man can easily lose his entire estate. Gambling. Women. Both. Or he stood surety for someone. Or he stood surety for a gambling woman! You son of a... Guess you've matured. Not cursing... Listen. All the land's been transferred to one man. His name's CHUN Yong-duk. He's the influential Chief in town. Smell anything? Like what? CHUN Yong-duk. Lives in Minsung. Age, over 70. Please investigate this. What! You crazy? Why would l help you? Are you shameless or just plain stupid? l'm a pretty busy man, you know. Can't you investigate that much on a tip-off from a citizen? On a tip-off from you? lnvestigate? Think you're a detective? Prosecutors are so busy we don't even drink water at lunch. Because we don't have time to go to the bathroom. So stop calling me, you bastard! Hello? Hello? Damn it! Hello? CHUN Yong-duk. Lives in Minsung. Over 70 years old. Hello? You hung up, right? You son of a... Hurry up! Or you won't get lunch! Hurry up! Hurry! What the. Why are you moving things out? lt's crowded in here with useless things. What's that? A sensor light. lt's dark and dangerous here at nights. The Chief says to stop by. Where's his place? Shit! You don't even know where the town's Chief lives? And terrible manners! Not looking at me when l'm talking. Chief? What a great view. We built everything here in town. Probably thought we were all out to get you at first. We're uncomfortable with city folks around here. l understand. You'll get to know the town folks. First, you can start with me. l'm the beginning and the end here. l see. Thank you, sir. Finished moving things out? No, l still have a long a way to go. l found a bunch of account books in storage under the room. There are many dates and numbers that l can't make out. l'll have to look 'em over closely after cleaning up. Good. lf Dad had any debts, l'll ask you for help, Chief. Sure thing. Any time. - Drink up. - Yes, sir. l'll be going then. Sleeping at the store tonight? Yes, for a couple more days. Go on. Bye. ls Hae-guk in his room? Come out for a drink! Must be sleeping early. l haven't seen him all day. Must be tired. His dad dies, then he goes around hoping to get something. But he never showed when Mr. RYU was alive! That money hogging bastard! Like father like son. Wish he acted more like Mr. RYU. That's insane! lt'll be disaster if he ever starts acting like Mr. RYU. Conscience bothering you? Of course not! Young-ji! Hey! Get off me! A heavy body clouds the mind. Then you succumb to sin. You crazy! Poor Mr. RYU! His funeral felt so empty and lonely. - Have a drink. - Sure. Sleeping at the store tonight, too? What are you doing here! Ah, the Chief suddenly called me so l went! He yelled at me for being careless and... Ah, No! That's not it. He said to move the things out here. l'll move 'em inside for ya. That's why l came. Honest! What are you staring at? See? l have the rope right here. To tie 'em up. This rope's too short. l'd better go home and get more. Go back to sleep. Sorry to wake you. Chief! No need for you to come all the way. Damn rain! - Officer CHUN doing good? - Yes, sir. - He gave you this? - Yes, sir. lnheritance... Claim your estate... Co-ownership? And he also visited the registry office a lot. l'd search through everything, too. lf he's cautious. This last page is on Hae-guk's emails. His lD is RYUHG80... He's divorced. Looks like he lost everything to his wife but his balls. That explains it. There's a reason why he's not going back. The fool dented a prosecutor's career? Prosecutor PARK Min-uk. Take turns confessing what you were charged with. Since you can't write, record it on tape, Sung-kyu. And you write yours, Seok-man. Name, HA Sung-kyu. Age 35. l was born in Kyung-buk. l ran a bar on Walsan lsland. - Fire! - Help! Fire! Fire! Fire! Shit! You started a fire! Think you can make it out alive? How? Swim your way out? Shit. lt's all over now. Today's your funeral. You burned 8 people to death? How do you sleep at night? Damn money! How can you eat after making money like that? Huh! Using other people and selling their bodies! Think your body will be safe! You fool! Sung-kyu. Sung-kyu! Sung-kyu. Sung-kyu! Sung-kyu! Sung-kyu! Sung-kyu! What's got into Detective CHUN? He's killing him! You bastard! Stop lying! You son of a bitch! Wait! Please! l'll tell you the truth. Say it! He stole all the money l'd been saving for 15 years. When l asked around and finally found him... He laughed and said he spent it all. There's not a dime left! So you shot him? Four times? He threatened me with a knife for more money. Said he'll kill me! l still don't think l did anything wrong. That bastard deserved to die. lf what you say is true... You did good. What are you thinking? Fool! Wanna come with me? l kinda am. Prison is for those who didn't get to meet me. True rehabilitation... Can't be done in prison. l got a good feeling about you. lf you come with me, you'll have to get rid of that nasty temper. Or hide it. lt's the only way you'll live. All l did was kill a wild beast. l must've lost it then. He was definitely a bear. That's why l shot him 4 times. How could l shoot a person that many times... That's it! Just like that! Look like you're really sorry. Got it? Yes, sir. You're good. You'll get 2 to 3 years tops. Think you can forget everything and start over with a clean slate? Yes, sir. Now that you know each other's secrets, watch out for each other. Do as we say like a good boy. And don't even look at things you know you should stay away from. Got it? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. When the time comes, l'll divide up everything with you. l'll introduce you to someone. Mr. RYU Mok-hyeong? Greet him. You and l are the same, but Mr. RYU is different. He's a teacher... A master, and the heart of the village. Treat him with more respect than any mayor. l hope to learn how to write from you Mr. RYU. Let's start over anew. Report on CHUN Yong-duk How much in total? Over $23 million, sir. How did he make that much as a cop? Did he inherit it? The land went up in price, but he was rich as a cop, too. When RYU transferred the land it was worth only $200,000... That was a lot of money back then. Right, sir. Anyway, soon after it skyrocketed, and they both paid their taxes. Really... - Take care. - Goodbye. Good work. Eat up all the stores here. - Thank you, sir. - Eat up. Hello, sir. - Good work, Mr. KlM. - Thank you. - See ya. - Take care, sir. He's coming! Welcome, sir! - Everything going well? - Of course, sir! Ms. KlM? Coffee! - Hello, sir. - Hi. - Hey, fool. - Yes? Why so happy? This thing's pretty powerful. Closed for personal reasons He thinks business is a joke? Looks like Baldy's got some nerve. lsn't Seok-man older than you? Yes, but we're all growing old. That's strange. - Let's check his house. - Yes, sir. Get out. l found this tunnel at Dad's place. So l can live. Get out! lt's connected to this house. Can you explain why? Sorry to come in without permission. But how can l not come in a situation like this? Get out! l... Could kill you. W...What? What are you doing! You think we're strange? What do you mean? You're suspicious of everyone here over your father's death? What exactly do you think your father was? lf he lived with us... What do you think he was? l'm sick of everything. Disappear, will ya? You people killed him, didn't you! What was he here? Go ask him yourself. Looks like he's not home. No shoes, either. Seok-man! Where's he going? Seok-man! l'm beat. Stop, you fool! Call him again. Why are you trying to kill me? Ask your father that, too. Shit. Must be around Stone Rock. lf the Chief is the beginning and the end of this town... There must be someone who made him possible. Go meet him and ask. lt's amusing. No! Not this way! Hey! Hey! Seok-man! Shit! Seok-man! Seok-man! Where is he! Damn it! He's not here, sir. - His phone rang from here, right? - Yes. Shit! Where's he hiding? Oh shit! Look! Seok-man! Seok-man! Seok-man! Oh no! Seok-man! Oh no! What do we do! Oh no! Shut up! How'd he end up like that? Oh God... What do we do? What's the matter? l heard someone screaming on my stroll... What a rough trail. What did you just say? A stroll? Yes. ls something down there? l think Seok-man fell down there dead! What? Why? Why'd he come up here during work? l don't know! We're wondering that ourselves. Why'd he come up here in broad daylight and drop dead? He never leaves the store during the day. Why did he come here? Probably didn't come alone. Or did he? No way. Why would he come here alone? Are you saying someone killed him? l'd, ah, better get going. l'm coming down with a cold. What the hell! A man's dead and he's worried about a cold! - Call Officer CHUN. - Yes, sir. The Sam-deok Prayer House case. The director killed 27 members, then committed suicide. Someone was at the scene before the cops got there. lt was detective CHUN Yong-duk. Nice! The Holy Bible Samdeok Prayer House Eye for an eye... CHUN Yong-duk What now! Please don't hang up. Listen to me. l almost got killed. Almost? One of the town folks tried to kill me. He fell off a cliff during our fight. ls he almost dead? Completely dead. Did you look into CHUN Yong-duk? CHUN who? Never heard of him. Why should l investigate him? For what? Fine. Then you won't be able to get me. l'll turn myself in. No! What's the number? No! You can't! Are you an idiot? Fine. CHUN was a detective and something wasn't right. Yes, l started investigating him. Then what? That's it. Don't do anything foolish till l bring you in myself! So, are you hurt? Did you go to the hospital? Hey! Don't call me unless you're completely dead! l'll be right in after l wrap things up here. - Did you book the funeral? - Yes. - All the files ready? - Yes. Said it was an accident? lt's obvious isn't it, sir? Fool! Every corpse has a story! lf a frog dies, get the kid who threw a rock at it for fun! Yes, sir. Dr. CHOl will be in soon. He'll do the postmortem. Give him Seok-man's jacket, pants, socks, everything! Got it? Yes, sir. Are you okay? We spent 25 years together. Yes, l know how you feel. l'll take care of that bastard myself. Why? Does it hurt that much? Seok-man probably felt the same as l did. lt's like Mr. RYU coming back from the dead to haunt us. We're sinning again. And evil's churning inside. l can't take it anymore! Does it look like l can? He'll leave on his own. lf not, l'll deal with him myself. Be careful. Remember, he's RYU's son. Good, you came. Have some food. Okay. Let's go Deok-chun. We got lots to do. Curious aren't you? About the Chief, Seok-man...and me. Young-ji at the store, Mr. RYU... lf l tell you everything... Then will you leave? Promise! Fine. Everything you want to know is at my house Take it and go. - Hello. - Hi. Come in. - Hello. - Stay seated, sir. Welcome, Prosecutor PARK. - Busy? - No, sir. Come with me. A superior introduced him to me. He's got major connections. Beyond imagination. lt's your chance to go to Seoul! What's with you? There's no harm in meeting him. Yes, sir. Good luck. Nice to meet you. Prosecutor PARK Min-uk, right? Yes. l'm CHUN Yong-duk. l used to be a detective. So? How can l help you? You know RYU Hae-guk, right? RYU Hae-guk... Heard he caused you quite a headache in the past. And? l came to see if we could talk. Me? With you? Yes. That fool made a big mistake. Are you trying to use a prosecutor for your own affairs? Some detective! What do you think you're doing! l think there's been a misunderstanding. That's not it. l just wanted to meet and share some information. Let me tell you something about him. He destroyed a prosecutor's career for good. lf anything happens to him, you're spending life in prison. l'm bringing him down! Got that! Don't misunderstand me, Prosecutor. lt's hot in here. Someone died in town and l think RYU's involved. Call me if you need anything on him! That son of a bitch. l'm busy collecting info on you. Should we send Prosecutor PARK something? Sometimes you can give 'em everything and still get smacked. Still, l never saw a fool who didn't want money. No need to rush. There are people in higher places. Hello? lt's RYU Hae-guk. Hello? l was worried you might not come. Now, it's time for you to go. You people killed him! Didn't you! The city man's pretty strong! Bastard! The coffee's great. We got lots of time. The night is long in the mountains. You think your father was the victim? Ever think he could be the offender? Like how you killed Seok-man. Don't look surprised. Like father like son. Hold your horses! l'll send you to your father! The sickle will work best. Where's that sickle? Guess it's in the warehouse. l'll be right back. Try and escape if you can. Sung-kyu! No! lsn't that Sung-kyu's house? What in the world? Sung-kyu! Sung-kyu! Hurry! Get some water and put the fire out! That son of a bitch! Sung-kyu? We were all living good, right? lt wasn't good for you? Why aren't you answering? Yell like you always do! Answer me... Let's go to the hospital. You should get treated. No! l'm going back. Just go? Without finding out anything? l don't give a damn anymore. l can't take it! They're all crazy! - You didn't even try. - What? Sung-kyu and Seok-man's tape and the Bible from Sam-deok Prayer House. Who put them there! And why... l don't care. lt's your battle, already. lt's what your father wanted! What he wanted! Yes? Sung-kyu's dead, too. Did you see Hae-guk? Yes, he's with me. Really? What's he doing? He's hurt. l'm taking him to the hospital. Stop the car! Okay. Stop the car, now! Where's RYU Hae-guk? He forced me to get off so l took a cab. l don't know where he went. - He's young, right? - What? You like young men? lf you help him again... l'll kill you. Go to bed. Mr. RYU Hae-guk? Remember me? We met at your father's funeral? Ah, yes. Looks like you've been assaulted. Come with me to the station. lt's okay. l got it treated. We should investigate and catch the assailant. You don't understand. We settled it and it's over. We'll be the judge of that. Let's go. What if l don't? We'll have to take you by force. You'll take me in for questioning? lllegally. Don't let me force you, sir. Before you take me by force... Let me record your name, department, and reason. Why you! From now on, talk to my lawyer. Your lawyer? l met him while fighting against the police and prosecutors. Never lost a case. Attorney PARK? What? Attorney? lt's RYU Hae-guk. Some officer is trying to take me in illegally. Please talk to him. Hey! RYU Hae-guk! Hold on. Yes? Hello? Hello? Look... What do you think you're doing to Mr. RYU Hae-guk! l'm ah...PARK Min-uk... his lawyer. l see. Mr. RYU Hae-guk's been in a violent fight. So? l'd like to take him in for questioning. Still, you have no right. l'll say it again. lt's clear he's been in a fight. l think he needs to be questioned on the case. You're really set on taking him in? There's ample reason to take him in. Stop. l'll be right over. Put Mr. RYU back on. Yes, Mr. PARK? Why you little! l'm coming to see what kind of shit you're in! l gotta see what you gained after destroying me! He's got a lawyer? His name's PARK Min-uk. Who? Attorney PARKMin-uk. What? PARK Min... That's strange. - Officer CHUN. - Yes. That lawyer's a prosecutor. A prosecutor? The one you met before? Right. Then why would he lie to help out RYU Hae-guk? Says he'll kill Hae-guk himself. Doesn't want anyone else touching his meat. A prosecutor impersonating a lawyer? Should l charge him? What good is that? Think about who will be hurting more after everything's in the open. Yes, sir. They'll bring up Seok-man's death. Not only that, it'll bring up Mr. RYU, too. What? Complicate things. So they can't see the big picture. Got it? Yes, sir. Are you RYU Hae-guk's lawyer? l'm a prosecutor from Chang-sung District. Long time no see. Ah, hello. Unaware of what's going on, l had to pretend l was a lawyer. You can go back, sir. We'll drop the case, too. l'm glad we see eye to eye. Mind if Mr. RYU and l go about our business? What? Let's go, Mr. RYU. Let's talk about life, shall we? Yes, sir. Two people in town are dead and l was involved with both of 'them. Wait. l'll map things out. Let me do the questioning. What? l have to draw the big picture. Let's take things in order. What a perfect place to cover up two deaths. Nice fresh air! Nice, isn't it? Not much but the good air around here. Welcome, Prosecutor PARK. l came to investigate Mr. JEON Seok-man's death. Here's the suspect, RYU Hae-guk. Looks like a criminal, doesn't he? Then l'll be pleased to help. Why thank you. Help from a veteran detective... Pretty impressive. lt's all in the past. lt's been a long time since l quit the force. l was talking about your real estate records. Of course! They say you get a house just by brushing shoulders with me. Your mother lives in an apartment without an elevator, correct? Oh, by the way! Tell her to sell it before it gets cold. l heard a crematory is coming in behind there. l don't like you. Same goes for me. Strange. Who's that on the left? KlM Deok-chun. The Chiefs henchman. So he's a trustworthy guy? He knows a lot about the Chief. - You be the prosecutor. - What? Crap. That's the Chiefs house. lt's like a feudal lord's castle. You can look down and keep watch on everything. So this tunnel was for keeping watch on your father? l think so. The answer is with the Chief, the store owner, and KlM Deok-chun. lt's gotta be the Chief. - And his right hand? - KlM Deok-chun? He obeys no matter what? He'll do everything the Chief says. That's right! l just did as he ordered. Mr. KlM Deok-chun! What is it? What do you want? ls it... My turn now? Seok-man, Sung-kyu... Now...lt's my turn? lt'll come without warning, right? No one will kill you. l'm a prosecutor. As long as l'm here, no one can kill anyone. What do you have to do with their deaths? Why's it your turn? You saying you killed them? l don't know anything but what l was told. l didn't do anything! l just took things back and forth like he said! l beat 'em like l was told! And killed... You just did what you were told. lt's not like you wanted to do it. Yes, that's right. l did it cuz l was told. Buy land for the governor. Send two apple boxes to Senator PARK. They said to thank the Chief. So what did the Chief say? Put in money instead of apples. lt's so heavy. Secret number 2736. Take out $30,000 in cash. l go from Seoul to Busan. But have to wait outside. But l'm starving. Senator SONG likes caviar and Senator PARK likes Marlboros. Put the apple box in Senator HONG's car. Don't look good to fill it half way. Get a smaller box! l gotta find the right box. The guy's suing us after selling his land over. Kill him! You deal with messy things like that! The Chiefs busy. He's gotta meet the senators and handle things. l wanna go and eat yummy stuff! But only Chief gets to go! Then l grab the bastards' necks! So... Chief meets and gives boxes full of cash to big shots... while you beat up people and grab their necks! Make him sign the accounts. lf he won't, get his thumb print. lf you can't get that, cut off his finger! lf he resists, cut his neck! lf not, dig up his ancestors' graves! Burn the house down if you have to! We get it. You just did what you were told! - Look. - KlM Deok-chun! No! Chief! Please don't hit me! Don't smile while you beat me. That scares me more! lt hurts more. l'm scared! No, Chief! Please! - Deok-chun, hurry over. - Sir? - l'll see you there. - But l'm busy... Drop it and hurry over! Got something for me to do, sir? - Will you do it? - Of course. - You in a good mood? - Yes. Looks like the idiot's heart was frozen hard. What? You know, Deok-chun... l liked your blank slate. Blank slate, sir? Other people's slates were red, blue, and black. They had their own strong colors. l had to paint all over 'em. But you were white. l thought l could do anything with you there. l only took you around and gave you errands... Not cuz you're slow... But cuz l like you. l beat you! Cuz l didn't want you to get stained. l only wanted you to follow me, But in the end l ripped you to pieces. l'm sorry. Don't be, Chief. Not you, Chief. Don't do this, sir. Please? Must've been hard for you. No! l'm okay, sir. You can rest now. Chief... No, Chief! Chief! KlM Deok-chun is dead. l'm going to the Chief. Wait! You saw how he dealt with the two deaths in town. Get out of there, for now. We'll investigate Deok-chun's death. Who the hell is CHUN Yong-duk? What did my father do? Guess l can't live quietly like moss. Pain for pain. Scar for scar Eye for an eye! Fine! l'm going right to him! Let's see if he can kill me like he killed my dad. l told you to get out of there! Hello? Hello? Thanks for everything. RYU Hae-guk! Have some. You killed him, didn't you? You killed my father! Answer me! lt's okay. There's no one left to come and eat. They're all dead. Did you kill my father! l'm not finished eating! Did l kill him, you ask? Wanna hear my story? See, we walk on land. But he could touch the clouds. Moo. So damn sweet! Who caught a cow? Mr. YEOM did, yesterday. Now this is natural food! Veggies aren't everything! Where are the others? l think the three of 'em ran off. Didn't even leave a sock behind. Fools. Couldn't stick it out. One must overcome the pain of the sins he committed. But people can make a few mistakes in life, can't they? What we did were no mistakes. They weren't accidents. We must work hard to deeply repent our sins. To wash away our sins. Will this be better? Will this wash the sins away? What the hell are you doing! Apologize to Mr. RYU, now! l'm sorry. Mr. RYU? They're simple-minded. Please understand 'em. Of course. l appreciate their honesty. That's good. Young-ji, stay here. The three of you come with me. What? Five times? Wow! You really hit it off with that girl! l kept away from girls way too long! l really needed that! Forget today and go back to normal. Then l'll see to this regularly. And keep your pants on! Yes, sir. Not asleep yet? Did you go into town? Yes. The guys had it rough so l helped them relax a bit. You mean people buying other people? No, beasts borrowing humans. They're not humans. What? We brought 'em here to turn 'em into humans. Then they're still beasts! So we should give 'em the carrot once in a while. That's how you tame the beasts. Who says we can tame them and make them into people? They're not animals. We can't own people. That's for books. Reality is different. You have a long way to go to understand the real world. We're eating raw rice for crying out loud! You can have all the credit. Just let us relax will ya? Tell me how you want to live. What? You've washed away your sins. What do you want to do now? What kind of man do you want to be? What are you saying, Mr. RYU? l'm happy the way l am now. And... Stop saying sin. l feel like a sinner, like l'll sin again, when l see you. lt's hard. Your son's schooling comes first. Not the factory. lf he succeeds, who needs a factory? Can't you give us another $1,000? Come on. lt's not my fault it's worth shit. But it was worth two times that last year! Go back and sell it then! Yeah! You don't need the field in front of your house now, right? l'll pay you $200 on top for that. Take it or leave it! Sir! Have some ribs! Barbecued dog's the best! l knew it. You were right! Fear will save me. You still don't get it? This town was made thanks to you, but it's not running because of you. lt's cuz of me! You're living thanks to me. Who do you think you are! Thought you could be god? Holding a knife, about to kill him! Some god! Why aren't you getting rid of me? You really don't know? You're a master at fooling people! l run things with money, gifts, and threats. But you look at 'em once and say, Have you been redeemed? Then they all go crazy! Ready to kiss your ass! l admit it! With you there, l could win people over without money, gifts, or violence! l made you! l made your status here! When you were talking about god and shit... l dealt with con-men, thieves, murderers, gangsters! l can't turn 'em into humans, but l can grab their necks like this! And shake 'em all l want! You wanted to become god? l wanted to become a man! Someone who grabs 'em like this! You're a human too, you bastard! Live here from now. lf he tried to kill the Chief, he would've killed us, too. You're no different from us. Holding up a knife like that. Did l lie about anything? No. Seok-man and Sung-kyu had their sad stories, too. Deok-chun, too. Now that they're all dead. l don't feel so good. Can l go now? l'll make you dinner before you leave town. l'll make you chicken soup and tell you what you want to know. Come by tomorrow night. You finish looking into Song-gang Prison. Yes, sir. There's nothing official on the prayer house case. So find the search team back then. Yes, sir. lt'd be nice if CHUN Yong-duk didn't hear about this. ls KlM Deok-chun's autopsy report coming in tomorrow? Yes, sir. Good. And why can't we track CHUN's bank account? Higher authorities are already looking into it. They're telling us to back off. This is bigger than we thought. Let's crack it. Let's go! Hello? Yes, it's me. What? How can l help you? lt's about RYU Hae-guk. Why should l hear about RYU Hae-guk from you? For what? No one else will tell you about him besides me. Let's hear it. RYU Hae-guk is going to the Chiefs house tonight. What? He wants to end everything tonight. Quick question. Ever heard of Sam-deok Prayer House? Yes. Did the Chief kill the people? Think you can beat the Chief with that? lf he's planning to kill me, he can expect to bleed, too. Whoever has the knife or gun will die first. Think about the people who died. Make him hold the knife first. What do you want me to do? What the hell do you know? Who are you? Hi, Hae-guk. Why'd you call so late? l even sent a telegram. ls this about your mom? She already passed away. When? You really want to know? Her remains are in a charnel house. Would you like to go? l'm hanging up now. Young-ji? Come in for a sec. This is good. Young-ji? Whose side are you on? Mine or RYU Mok-hyeong's? No answer. Guess that doesn't mean me. Does it matter? No. But why does it hurt so much? ln my heart. You're the only one in town. What? Who follows him and not me. What's the reason? He knows everything. He has to die! But he saved me. And me? You got revenge for me. How amusing. There's no end to greed. Are you going to kill Mr. RYU? Will that be the end? Why would l? l've got men who'd do it... Just hoping you'd be on my side, too. What if l don't? Then l'll make you obey! You wanna see RYU Mok-hyeong alive? Tonight... l'm sleeping here. Who are you! Don't be scared. l'm on Mr. RYU's side. You know l'm on your side, right? lt's okay. lt's okay. l'm sorry. - l'm so sorry. - Don't be. lt was my battle to fight. And this is yours. That your father left for you. As soon as we arrive, block off the town completely! Especially the cops there! - Are you armed? - Yes, sir. - Looking good. - Sir? Prosecutor PARK Min-uk speaking. You! lf you don't pullout right now you're out of a job! Got it! Got it. So be it, sir. Who was that? Boss says to pullout. Keep driving. Let's see who'll lose the job. lnstant chicken soup. But it doesn't smell that bad. Seok-man died because of me. lt's a killer! Sung-kyu also died while trying to kill me. lt's boiling. Why did they try to kill me? What did l do that was so wrong they would try to kill me? They probably tried to kill you cuz you fired up their true natures. What the hell are you saying? Shit. Why's my ear so itchy? People are so stupid. ln all my years as a detective, l found people kill and die for stupid reasons. So, for what stupid reason did you kill my father! Young-ji? Put the damn knife away. Stay still! You're still talking about that? Fool! Why would l kill RYU Mok-young? For what? Don't think l could handle him like all the others? Me? You're saying he died on his own? He just died! Cuz he was old! What a laugh! Put the gun down! Yup. That is funny. Mr. CHUN Yong-duk! You're under arrest for assaulting KlM Deok-chun. We'll deal with your other crimes later. You did your homework. Where's the warrant? There's an emergency arrest in Criminal Procedure Law. lf you have a criminal record longer than 3 years. Or if you did something that's reason enough for imprisonment. Or if you try to run or destroy evidence we can skip the warrant. There's no way Commissioner KlM approved of this! Search through Commissioner KlM's office and house at dawn. Yes, sir. l'd shut my mouth if l were you. l'll bring down all your buddies! You know it's nothing without any proof. Let's start with assaulting KlM Deok-chun! You got proof? Blackmail. Show me the evidence! Bribery! l said show me the proof! Search the closet in the store's main bedroom. There are old documents and other evidence. Get everything. Report to me when you're done. l repeat! Search the closet in the store's main bedroom! Get all the evidence now! Young-ji... What the! Who's there? Shit. What's that sound? Some cop lit up a gas can and set the store on fire! Get the bastard! He's burning inside, too! lt's the Chiefs son! Father! His son's dying! That bastard! lt'll be harder to miss from here. Let's go. Everything went up in flames. Why should l go? Right? You have nothing on me! Worry about yourself. Son of a... Say it! Tell me about my father! You sure you can handle it? The man who was the beginning and the end to this town! Think you can handle it? Ever heard of Sam-deok Prayer House? Director PARK! Who did this? RYU...Mok...hyung... RYU Mok-hyeong? You're lying! l heard from Mr. RYU and even witnessed something. What the hell! You were too young to remember anything! l was old enough and remember clearly. Why'd you come out so soon? They're all busy praying. Let's say goodbye later. - Let's go! - Okay. Mr. RYU? Did you go to the prayer house? Ah, no. There's a present there for you. What present? A token of my appreciation for meeting someone like you. - Mr. RYU! - Yes? l... Ah... nothing. l just remembered something. lf what you say is true, l was going to kill myself. Know what l mean? But why would my dad hide a mass murder? Because he did it! lf the Chief didn't do it, it's possible Mr. RYU did. ln the name of judgment. What are you doing! Accomplice awareness? Mr. RYU felt guilty every time he saw the Chief. Who says l killed them! l was a detective back then! l can hear it in your voice. Let's go in. You can't take me in without any evidence! Make the most precious thing common! Mr. RYU said to leave it just anywhere. What are you saying? There's more evidence? Talk! Or l swear l'll rip it out of you! Where everything is kept in our town. lt's all there. The warehouse! Search it! Handle all documents carefully. Collect everything even the garbage! lt's here, sir! Old accounts and stamped documents! Pledges with thumb prints in blood! lt's all here! The world you built crumbled as of today! What do you have left to protect? ls that what you want? Fine! Let's fight this with the law. Let's go! l'll do it. But! What is it? Didn't you see ex-presidents? l'll get dressed properly first. Wait outside. No! What are you trying to pull! Why? Think l'll kill myself? Crazy? You'd like that, wouldn't you? l'll give you 5 minutes. lf you pull anything, we'll shoot you down. Got that? For men like him, it's like wearing armor before a war. But l still don't know how my father died. The Chief is right. What? Mr. RYU died on his own. What? So you'd come. What did he want from me coming here? Everything you did till now. Everything l did? Bring judgment he couldn't. You wanna fight? Think you can bring me down? To get to me... You'll have to dust the whole country! God damn it! Mr. RYU Hae-guk! Hello, Prosecutor PARK. Congratulations. Heard you're going to Seoul. Thanks. Congratulations to you, too. Excuse me? lt's great that nothing happened to you so far, isn't it? l guess you're right. See? We're communicating. lsn't that nice? You didn't do anything wrong. You wanted me to say that, right? l just did. Thank you. No need. You're not so bad. Just a little weird sometimes. l'm going to visit Dad. Why? lt's not a special day. Guess l owe him a lot. Have a good trip. Let's have drinks sometimes. Sure. l'll call you. You've been a big help. Thanks again. We just need to finish up building that area. - Hurry it up, please. - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. - Sure ma'am. Hello? Mr. RYU Hae-guk? Yes. Who's calling, please? Mr. RYU Mok-hyeong has passed away. What? Shouldn't you come? A KANG Woo-suk film
