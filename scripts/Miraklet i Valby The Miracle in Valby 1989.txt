Is everyone fresh? - Of course. Put your bags over there, and sit down. Please be quiet? Bo, stop doing that. It's important that all of us know what to do at the ceremony on Sunday the 10th. Let's rehearse it one more time. When the organ starts to play, and people start to sing No. 99... ...then I start to go over here and then you rise. - Then you two come forward. - Me? Wait... There is something that is not... - Bo, have you swapped places? - No, I haven't. - Not with Jesper? - Why should I have? It's probably my fault. We'll do it all again. Okay, please go to your initial positions. - SVN, not understood. Over. - I can't hear you. - Where are you, father? Over. - Oman Gulf, east of Muscat. When are you coming home? Over. We're going to Japan. I won't be home until Christmas. Rotterdam is dropped. Please explain it to Hanna. OZ5SVN, there's too much noise on the line. Over. - Dad, are you there? Over. - Rotterdam is dropped. Did you hear it? OZ5SVN, wait. Shit! The shipping company has new plans. You must explain it to Hanna. - Sven, are you there? - OZ9DAD, I'm here. Over. Have you get the gift? Binoculars? I bought them in Kuwait. They're American. You can see in the dark. I bought them in Kuwait. - Sven, did you get my gift? - I'm glad for it. Thank you. Over. Hello. OZ9DAD. Over. QRZ, QRZ, who's calling? Damn. QRZ, QRZ, who's calling? This are sounds from the signals coming from solar systems beyond our own. The signals are radio waves, which all celestial bodies emit. What we hear is one of the strongest radio sources in the universe. Radio astronomy is the modern science's most useful tool - - when it comes to the exploration of space. One can consider the universe as a gigantic information store. All energy, all radio radiation, all lights, come from the creation of the universe. Thousands of years of old radiation, left over from celestial bodies, - - maybe when Jesus walked on the Earth. Our past will be "translated" into a new language, to radio waves. Read the rest of the astronomy chapter for the next lesson. Pages 211-230. Come on! - Come, we're going to visit mom. - Please no, I'm having too much fun here. - Where's your bag? - I don't know. - Bye bye. - Bye. - I'd like to visit Lise Andersen. - She's in room 4. Hi! How nice to see you. - May I see the wound now, Mom? - Yes, but gently. - How's it going, Sven? - Okay. Do you need more money? - Gently, Hanna! - No, it's okay. They told me I'll probably be coming home on Friday. - It's nice of you. Can you manage it? - I said it's okay. - May I have another one, please? - When does father's boat arrive in Africa? In a few days. They're on the way to Japan. - Can you call him on your radio? - No, it's broken. - I want to talk to dad. - But you can't. Are all people in Africa negroes? I thought that maybe he was the only white. - Of course he's not. - Here's your French fries. - Can you really eat more? - Yes. Vam-pire... ...Ro-bot. The vampire robot. See how he gets blown into tiny pieces. Mot-her-ship. The Mother Ship. Vam-pire. The vampire robot. - Damn, I lost him. - Dad, are you there? - Stop it, I told you not to touch it. - I just wanted to talk to Dad. It wasn't him. There is something very wrong. Zokman enters the magnetic cloud. He pulls the power to him. - You know he always has it with him. - Eat. Rock block, zip-zip! "He has green blood," says Laser Man. Laser Man... Is it okay if I go out? You promised that we would read comics and watch horror movies. There's something I must do. I'll be back in an hour. - What do I get for it? - $2. - Why can't I ever go with you? - $3. - $3.50 - One hour, okay? Hey. $3.5 dollars! (In Swedish) What if I don't want to? I'm a human being too, dammit! - Don't use profanity. - Stupid bitch! - What are you doing? - It was your mother, right? What do you think about being in Denmark? I came here two months ago! It's probably okay, but we're going to move again. To California. - Well. When do you leave? - Soon. What is that? Oh, it's just an aerial cable. I've borrowed Mller's antenna. - This is great. - Yeah, it's okay. This is a shortwave radio. I talk with my father every day. With your father? Yes, my father is out sailing. He's a telegraph operator. This was my first radio. It was a present from him. This one I built myself. My father and mother are divorced, so I don't see him very often. Hi, what are you doing here? It's a great place, right? Yeah, really cool. Sven was showing me his equipment. He's sure to win the Nobel Prize, and then we can really brag about him. Where's the one you built? Where is it? - Do want to hear? - I'd like to hear it. There you see. I've been getting something strange on the radio. I don't know what it is. - It's local news. Fucking Cool. - Wait a minute. We need to change the frequency. Here's where it starts to get exciting. - That sounds damn weird. - I keep losing him every time. He's speaking Latin. - Wait, I'll switch to Mllers antenna. - Latin? It sounds stupid. He sounded like a priest. Okay. - Ready? - Ta-da! What's happening? (We interrupt this program for an important message.) The Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme is dead. He was gunned down in Stockholm tonight. Police have no clues. - He was killed by a shot... - That's sick! - What are you doing? - The shooting happened several years ago. - It's fucking weird, Sven. - You're crazy. I'm leaving. It's not something to make fun of. You stupid idiot. I'm leaving too. Mommy! Dad! The police have no clues as to the perpetrators. - Everyone in Sweden was shocked... - What? The perpetrator escaped. Passport control was implemented immediately at border crossings and airports. A description of the suspected perpetrator has been published. At 11:30pm two shots sounded here in the middle of Stockholm. One of the shots hit Palme. Half an hour later he died. Police were alerted by a taxi driver who heard the shots. - They've shot Palme. - Another tried to give him artificial respiration. Hanna? - Mother? - I'm going to bed and read a little. - Are you back already? - I came home at five o'clock. - From the hospital? - Hospital? What are you talking about? Is there something wrong, Sven? - You haven't been to the hospital? - What hospital? Remember to close the refrigerator. (For Sale) - Damn! - No! The police have told Mrs. Palme that her life is not in danger. We will return... That was "Dangerous" by Roxette. You're listening to local radio Valby. Hanna? - Hello? - No one's home? Yes, of course. You owe me $3.50 - What did you do last night? - Nothing special. - No, tell me something. - I've talked to dad. - What did he say? - He won't be home until Christmas. - Why? - They're going to Japan. - I think that was what he said. - Japan... - It may not be fun for him. - No, it must be dead boring. - But it's also for us. - Yes, of course. Sorry, I didn't think about that. Hello, my name is Sven. Is Petra home? Petra, you have a visitor. Sit down. She's coming now. I'm glad you came, Sven. I wanted to talk to you. - I just wanted to give her this jacket. - As you know, we're moving to California. Of course it is difficult for her to leave her friends. - Yes, it's obvious. - I don't know how you feel. But it is important to remember that... that everything takes time. - Well, it doesn't matter. - That's good. - We're just friends. - Yes, you are. Cheers. No, stay seated. Sven, what are you doing here? You forgot this. Bye. Idiot! - Hold on tight, Hanna. - What is it, Sven? "The Night of the Tentacles. " "Werewolf Nights". "The Ultimate Curse. " "Frankenstein Junior". "Emil from Lonneberga". No, you don't bother to watch that one. "Poltergeist" and "Aliens". If mom calls, I'm in the shower. Come on. We're out of here. Damn, it's cool! I can't believe you can get binoculars that can see at night. We need to get the cable completely over to the trailer. - You're insane. - Yes. - This is the main factory complex. - It looks good. - It's very good. And here you see the executive office building. That's where Bobby and I work. And this is the company bank, Union Bank, on Wilshire Boulevard. Oh, yes, and this is Long Beach. That big ship in the back, there... ...that's the Queen Mary, it's now a museum. Uh, this was meant to be a surprise, Bjorn. This is the car we've reserved for you. Okay, let's go. Drive on. So you know how Petra looked at me in physics class? - I think she's in love with me. - Are you going to help me? - Yes, of course. - Let's swap. Yes, yes. - Darling... - No, I'm leaving now. But we've talked about it. - Hi. - Hey, what are you doing here? - What are you doing? - We're... nothing. Sven just wants to try making another radio. What do you want to do? - I said I was going to the movies. - Good idea. Why don't you stay here, Sven? - Are you mad? - What are you actually going to do? Stop. It may be dangerous. - What have you done? - I don't know. This is crazy, Sven. Shouldn't we go back? Shouldn't we turn back? Hello! Petra. Where are you? Petra! - Hell! - Where is she? - Hallo! - Shut up! There's somebody out there. - They've taken her! - Who? Can you see her? Petra! Where the hell are we? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Do you think this is just a dream? But how can the two of us be having the same dream? What is all this? What is this? This is crazy, Sven. - Come on. Say it now, Sven. - We need to find Petra. You don't dare say it, do you? I can see it. Any idiot can. It's a different era. It's you who've done it. It was what you wanted. It's not normal at all. Yeah, I know. - Leave it alone, Sven. - No, let's look at it. Have you seen a girl? Wait a minute! We need to talk to you. Quiet, calm down. Relax. Maybe he knows something. We are looking for a girl. Girl. - He's scared of us. - We're sorry. We didn't mean it. Do you want some chewing gum? We're not that dangerous. Look at him. He's completely harmless. - He doesn't know he has to chew it. - Chewing gum. Chewing. We are looking for a girl. You gotta help us! Oh no. Run! No, hell! Bo, damn! Petra! - We must try. - What? Yes, to link us back. But how? How the hell should I know? It's you who can type. - Not a sound. - No! How could we be so stupid, so as to believe this? Oh, damn! Oh no! Start, damn it! ...Please use the road North of Bakkevej, - - since oil spills can cause traffic problems, police said. Police are at the scene. Traffic on Nyelandsvej should be normal again by 4pm.. It's a damn good movie, Sven! - But what are you doing at night? - Nothing special. All kinds of things. - Taking baths. - Taking baths. That's okay. Yesterday he bathed for over an hour. - We're just teasing you, honey. - You get this kind of food out in space. - What are you saying? - Space people get this kind of food. Petra said you and she were going to the cinema. Since then, no one has seen her. It's important that you tell us everything. - We don't suspect you of anything. - We split up later. - And then you went to the movies? - No. - She just wanted to talk. - Was she angry about something? Don't you see that he's lying? I said she was gone, and he acted as if he knew nothing. - It doesn't surprise me. - What do you mean? She was sad that she had to move to the U.S. She seemed as though... You think she was thinking of running away from home, or? I hadn't really thought of that. But it could well be. - You haven't said anything about that. - No... I didn't think... But it can't be. - He knows something he's not telling. - Do you know more, Sven? No. Here you go! No, stop. You're a bit late so it's not symmetric. - It's because Petra is not here. - Well imagine that she's here. You and David will be on line. We'll take it one more time. QRZ, QRZ, who's calling? - QRZ, QRZ, who's calling? - What is this? - Be quiet. Now read your magazine. - You don't want to hear me read aloud! What is this? Put it back. It's dangerous for small children. It's a signal gun. When you're lost, you shoot it. Then you can find your way home. Let's put it away. Hanna, I have to go out for a little while. You'll keep watch here, right? Arrgh! Why can't I ever go with you when something happens? We'll play that you live here. So, you tidy up, and I'll come and visit you. YES! - Bye. - Bye. bYou're the only one I know, who can read Latin. It is Latin, right?/b Well, even though you spelled it wrong. Aoris Domini. - Do you understand what it says? - It is an invocation of God. Tell me, do you know anything about the miracle in Valby? - Has there been a miracle here? - Yes, it's a legend. - You know the murals inside the attic? - Yes, yes. Some of them portray some monks, who worship a little girl. And a contraption. An astronomer had built a kind of telescope and had contact with God. Nobody knows what happened to him. Possibly he was burned at the stake as a heretic for blasphemy. Because the idea was - - that God would bestow upon the abbey, an angelic child. Or so the astronomer said. - But no one believed it. - No one believed him? You know, scientists had a difficult time back then. What he did was like a miracle, and the church didn't like that. - You're interested in medieval theology? - I'm interested in a little of everything. It's kind of silly to keep your shoes on, when it's your turn to do the cleaning. It's your week. There's something I want to talk to you about. You have to believe me, Dad. Otherwise I would never say such things. You know Sven's radio, right? His shortwave radio. He's found something wild. Voices from another time. Then we used the large dish antenna. ...and we ended up in another time. Petra, the Swedish girl, she was with us. - What are you saying? Petra was with you? - What can I do? I can't tell anybody. No, you shall not. There is suspicion that she's run away. It may also well be something else. - There are some sick people... - She hasn't run away! - She's there. - Where? There were knights. And a man who was tied to a pole. - Knights? - Yes, they had armor. - It must have been knights. - Yes... Now let's take it easy. - Now, tell me what you did. - I am telling you! Do you really want me to believe that it's knights, who have abducted Petra? Do you think I would tell you something as crazy as that if I was trying to lie to you? Of course not. But when was the last time you saw Petra? Shut up! Bo, damn! - You're stupid! - No, but I can't explain what's happened. What something? Goodnight. Hi. I just wanted to say, it was stupid of me to blame you. - It doesn't matter. - May I come in? I'm putting my sister to bed. My mother is in the hospital. Just for a moment? - Don't forget to tell Petra. - What was it I should tell her? That I and her mother will listen to her. Petra is my heart. - I have to check on Hanna. - What? Yes, of course. - They're coming here. - This is it! - Can you remember what you did? - I don't know. What is this cable? It's one of ours! - We'll never do it in time. - We must. - Where the hell was it? - They're here. Turn off the light. Hello, this is the phone company. Open the door. Sven, damn! Hello! Stop these pranks, boys. Come out. We must speak with you. Now open the door, damnit. It's the phone company. Come out, you brats! - Henry, pull the door. - Come on! - Come on, damn! - Stop the pranks. We need to talk to you! Come out! Hello! Come the fuck out! Let's go that way? Sven? My binoculars. What now, Sven? - Well, what do we do now? - I don't know. - Well, then get us out of here. - Stop it. - Is it my fault we're here? - You were in on it. It was only for Petra's sake. Do something. - What do you think? - She didn't come to visit you. You think it's you she's in love with? She talks to me all the time. You only care about your stuff. And fiddling with your radios. Damn fool! Sven! Bo! - Hi. - Petra! It's just dad's egg-timer. Wow. What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Bo! Yes, damn it! What's happening? Come on! Where the hell is it? Religious idiots! To hell with these medieval peasants! Where's my trailer? Laser Man's forces disappear - - when the Death Woman throws him into the Robot Monster's mouth! "Zap, Zap" sounds come from Laser Man's jaws. See the robot? You don't know anything about the robot because I don't have the previous issue. Sven! - Hanna! - I was lost, but then they found me. Come here. You don't get to hear any more, but the Death Woman is a vampire. Come here. - Hello. - Hanna, come on! This is Jesus... Body of Christ. This is the body of Jesus Christ. OZ5SVN calling OZ9DAD. Over. OZ5SVN calling OZ9DAD. Sven, are you there? Over. OZ9DAD, I'm here, dad. I hear you loud and clear. Over.
