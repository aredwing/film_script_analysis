Can't be helped. Berlin is one huge traffic jam. You're stuck for an hour. I'd rather deliver pizzas. I have to go to the toilet. You too? No? I don't have... money. The GPS shows your position if you contact us or an emergency number. I wish you a good trip and see you. Bye... Can I come along? - Where to? Holland, Enschede. Come in. - Yes? Thanks a lot. It's so cold. I've come from Poland. My uncle owns a big hotel there. And that's where I work, in Warsaw. Do you live there? No, I just work there. No,this is... All the Poles are coming here, they come to Holland... And I'm going there. People always want to be somewhere else, right? And... what do you do? I sing. - You sing? Cool. Can you sing something for me? I also know a song. My love for you is like a balloon It all started under a moon I blew and I blew and kept blowing on Until it burst and you were gone. Nice. Are you married? I'm divorced. My husband left me. He is dead. Drove into the crash-barrier. Condolence You have 25 new messages. First message. Received on Thursday 19 November, 13:00. Hi there, it's Paco. I was wondering: Can I come and see you? I hope you'll call me back. Didn't he talk about us? Did he want to get rid of us? Or my mother? I wish he had simply left. Nina, it's Sven. We all want to know where you are. Can you phone, please? Three, two, one... Well done. My ballboy. Yes! How do you find them everytime? Well done. Come along. Come... Come. Come. Come along. Boris? Boris. Come here... Where's Boris? Where is Boris? Come here. Here's a stick. Come here. Let me do it. What's his name? Quiet. So you sing? In a band or something? In a Choir. A Choir? You know what a Choir is, right? Sure. A church choir? No, in a real one. We do all kinds of pieces, like... Popsongs, normal Songs... ...and Classical Songs. Classical Songs too? Like Bach? You know Bach? - Sure I know Bach. I know him too. He was born in Eisenach. It's a city next to the highway I am always passing by. There's a sign, Eisenach Birthplace of Johann Sebastian Bach. We once had a piece with no words, just... Noises? Primal sounds...? Primal sounds, yes? Yeah, and...we had to memorize them... And I thought it would be nice to assign an animal to each sound... Therefore I had a Zoo in my Head. For example, there was a Monkey Like this: And then there was a Bird. And so on. Was a lot of fun. That's how I was able to remember everything. Where is that choir? In Holland. Don't you want that? - No. You shouldn't save the best bits for the last. Ah, you lazy dog! Yes! There you are. Thank you. Check how you're sitting. Are you comfortable? You sit there for eight hours. -Yes. I'm siting okay. This here is the hand brake... and this is the automatic transmission. Forgot something? Always wear it. Always. Costs you 80 euros. Okay, so now... Turn the key. Foot on the brake. Now you can accelerate. Very slowly. Gently. Not jerkily. Slowly. Not too much gas. Slowly, not too much gas. Slowly. Not too much. Slowly. Carefully. Not so jerky. Nice, smooth movements. Slowly... Watch it, slowly That's not funny. I said: slowly. Take care always. It's dangerous. Accidents happen everywhere, all the time. I once saw a lorry loaded with wood driving under a bridge. The top trunk got shoved off into the car behind. Went through the windscreen and hit the passenger. She got pushed into the back. There she sat. Next to her child. Dead.That's not funny I'm sorry... Who's your worst friend? Tristan. A dog! Careful. He may bite if he doesn't know you. Have you boys said hello yet? Hey, say hello properly. Hello. - Hello. Nina. Who is Midas and who is Finn? Me. - Me. This is Finn and that's Midas. Where are we going? I want to go to the zoo. To the zoo? Has mummy told you? Yes, we're going to the owls and the eagles. That's a male. With raptors... The males are smaller than the females. In nature everything has a reason. The females must be larger: they brood. And bringing up the young takes two months. They need a reserve, when they depend on the male bringing food. But the male raptors are very faithful... Mummy must rush to the toilet. Come. - I want to see the birds. I need to go really badly It was such a long queue. Could you shortly look after her please? I'll be straight back, okay? Don'! run off. Stay with this lady, all right? Don'! run off. Stay with this lady, all right? Bushido is not an actor, he's an idiot. Bushido is so cool. - I don't know his name but you're right. Who wants the... - 24, that's yours. That's his name. He's called Elias. Who has the Hawaii and who gets the Margherita? What's up. Everything all right? - No. Shall I wrap them up? - No... Yes, you may start. I need peace. I have to work at my computer. I don't want his. It's horrid. What's this then? Your pizza. What are you whispering? - Nothing. Where do you live? - Which street? What number? I'm from Holland. - Do you have a husband? No, I'm with your daddy, aren't I? You don't have your own? Do you have kids? Don't look so stupid. What's up? - You're stupid yourself. Let's bring you home. Did you eat too much pizza? How old is the girl? Five. Is she tall for her age? I'd take a size 122. Bitterfeld. What's the matter? Why do you stay with me? You could go out. I can stop here so you can get out. You can get off now. Here. Matthias, please... Out you get. Go away. Go away. Out! I'm fed up with you. Shit... You don't give. You don't open up. You take from people what you want. You empty them. Until there's nothing left. Like in me. Go away. It's been enough. Take your dog and go. Off with you. Out! Out! Go away, go away! Part 1 - BORIS Hello. I'm glad you could come after closing time. The relatives... In the daytime the family has free access. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. That woman is me. Yes... It's not necessary Oh well, you have to make sure. This is her birth certificate. Yes. I was so scared when she'd been born. He had to go and check all the time... if she was still breathing. I didn't dare. I imagined her dead in her cradle. Anything else I can do for you? This is the voice-mail of Boris, Pien and Nina. Please leave a message after the beep. Go, please go. What can we do for you? - We're worried. Go away! Go away! Nina, it's for your own good. I mean... Go away! It's all yours. The contents of the lorry were released today He always wore this. - It was in the cabin. Yes, his boys meant everything to him. You had two of them? Three? I'm not her. If you wish, you can come with me. Nobody knows you there. Nina, it was my brother. I couldn't betray him. Do you want me to forgive you? It's not only your loss. Arms up. Is it right? - Yes. Okay. Come along now. I need to pee. Come. No, don't walk with the dog now. - Come, come. Paco. Paco. In you go. - What are you doing? Go on in. - You can't do this. It was his dog! Pien? Pien! Pien! Pien! I bet he did it on purpose. What else could he do? Then he would've taken a rope, or pills. Was he depressed or something? Did he still do it with your mother? Suicidal men don't get a hard-on. He must have left a note. Or taken off his shoes. They always take off their shoes first. Coming to sit next to mummy?
