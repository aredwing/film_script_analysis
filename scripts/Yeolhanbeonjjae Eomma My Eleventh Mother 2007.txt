He pisses me off. I can't believe I have housewife's eczema. I wish I had a mom. KIM Hye-su, KIM Young-chan RYU Seung-ryong, KIM Ji-young He's so stupid, like his father. I'm hungry! You don't deserve to eat. Take a look at this. Why can't you pass the driver's license test? You'll be too old to drive when you finally pass it. You're beyond help. I'm eating out. What? That bastard! Jae-su, you must be happy. No more step mom to nag you. Right? This one didn't last very long. Tell me. What kind of lady do you want for a mom? It doesn't matter. Because a nice lady wouldn't marry my dad. What if she happens to be a fox? A fox would never want to live in our neighborhood. I know that, but what if? All I want is one thing. I'd want her to stay with us forever. Let me carry it. Give it here. My 11th Mother Things are so expensive lately. I don't know how others do it. I'm always in the red. You can call me Mrs. Red. Will I be long? I'm in a hurry. No, you're almost done. Let me neutralize it. Baek-jung? Baek-jung! What now? Get your ass out here now. God! Earn your keep. I've been feeding you for over 30 years now. When he finally got a job, the company went down. Where are the rubber gloves? Just do it with your bare hands! I can't even sit down and study! Studying for what? It's a state test. State test my ass. It's for a damn driver's license. He failed the written test 8 times. I wonder what he has for a brain. - What's that? - A comic book. Let me see. If you have time for this, study! Come in. I didn't know you had a kid. Does it matter? Say hi. Hi, Mom. Mom? Hey. Are you sick? They sold you off for peanuts. I'm not sick. My liver isn't too good from drinking too much. Go wash up. So cold. It's getting warm. Let's eat. Didn't you hear me? Damn... You look so different without makeup on. And you look sick. What's up with your hair? It's disgusting. You can have it, Mom. Did you tell him to? He's not stupid. If you are my wife, you're automatically his mom. Tell him not to call me that. I might puke. It's good to have a girl in the house. What do you think about having a new mom? It's okay. Damn kid... What's wrong? Why the poker face? Damn... God! Food Stamp. Not going? Where? You put makeup on. I had nothing else to do. Don't you cook? Why so cold here even with the heater on? That's mine! Don't be so cheap over food. I got it with a food stamp. Jae-su? What's she like? Why are you so interested? She's not your wife. You smart ass! I'm just asking as a neighbor. Mind your own business. Come here. Tell me about her. She seems nice. She's a glutton. She does nothing but eat and sleep. Hi. Jae-su's step mom? I live right here. If you need a perm, come by anytime. I don't know why but... I'm constantly hungry. No matter how much I eat, I don't feel full. You know what they say? 'A woman who eats well has a great personality.' Right? What a childhood for Jae-su. He has a new mom every season. Considering that you're here, your life must be in shambles. You're quite pretty and... I'm sorry. You want some? It's cold. Hey, eat some. Come on, eat. Can't use chopsticks properly? Why do you always sleep? Why care? My food stamps! God! I can't believe this. Hello? You saw her picture? She's hot, isn't she? She's on sick leave now. She's pretty and smart. A good asset for your business. You'll get your money worth. All right. Alright! I can handle it! I don't have time to do this! Hit him! Hit him! Hey, it's too loud. That music is louder. What are you doing? Stop it! - Give it to me. - Give it back! Give it back! Hey! You worked at a girlie bar, right? So what? Why don't you go back? I don't need you. Look. I don't need you, either. A Dog of Flanders What are you doing? It's my book! Damn, you scared me. Why make a fuss over a book? It's an important thing to me. Come on, it's in tatters. My mom bought it for me. How'd she find it? Fuck! Where'd you hide it? There's no money. No? You're in trouble if I find it. No money? What's this? Isn't this money? You freaking liar. This income maintenance isn't yours. No! That's all we have for this month. - Get off me. - Give it back! Stop whining. I'll turn this into a fortune. You never cry like your mom. Damn kid... My back... That son of a bitch! Why take it out on the laundry? I almost had my hands frozen washing these! Freaking asshole! You know what? Shit, she isn't any better. Seon-hwa. Kyung-hwa. KIM Jae-su. What's this? There's an envelope. - Give it here. - What? - Give it back now! - Hey! Guys, Jae-su is Mr. Food Stamp. Pick them up. Or I'll keep them to myself. God! Give it here. Come on. I'll call the cops. Give it back. - I'll really call the cops! - Come on. It's not what you think. - Yes, it is! - It's not what you think. Of all the step moms I've had, you're the worst. You're a junkie. You're nothing but trash! I threw them all out. Are you crazy? Get out of here now! You're a bad woman! A vermin! Leave! Get out! Get out of here now! How can chocolate be medicine? It is for diabetes. I feel sorry for your mom. Your mom is sick and... She's not my mom. It's $12. I'm sorry. No, I'm not freaking sorry. You threw away my shots. That's why I'm paying. You're so shabby. You have money, don't you? If you do, you'd be better off somewhere else. Being here won't do you any good. Would I have come here if I had money? You haven't saved any? With or without money, I wouldn't be here if I were you. You can go to your mom. I don't have a mom. Who doesn't have one? Me. Yes, you do. She gave birth to you. Yeah, she did. And dumped me the next day. Did you eat? Yeah, dig in. You don't need to talk. Eat as much as you can. I'm finally being a good dad. Jae-su, how do you like her? You still have a problem with her eating too much? You shouldn't take his food. Your mom didn't do that. Jae-su, should I kick her out? What do you say? You wouldn't stop me, would you? How about you? Can you be his mom? Hey. Answer me! I'm not good enough to be a mom. You got that right. Yeah, that's how you should live. Being attached is never good. Fuck... Because you never know what might happen. Right? Eat more meat, not the rice! Here, drink some. You like drinking. What? But you're sick... There you go. Give it. You sure can drink. Sing. You sing. You don't like me because I eat too much? What's your favorite food? I'll buy it for you. What do you hate the most? Oysters. They're my favorite. Why do kids hate oysters? They're so good. Look... When'd you start cooking for yourself? You shouldn't be cooking. We get income maintenance and food stamps. I didn't like it when they gave microwave food. 'Cause we don't have a microwave. But I never trade food stamps in for snacks like other kids do. And I often visit a food tasting stand at the mall. When'd your mom leave? Huh? When I was 4. You remember that? Whether I do or not, it's none of your business. I guess not... Damn it. Do you know who is the sorriest person on earth? Dirt broke... So many medical issues... All alone... It's me. I thought so before I met you. But I was wrong. The sorriest person on earth is you. Water... Those who beat kids should rot in hell. Why? Because... Forget it. You're the sorriest person, and I'm the second. Why? You don't have a mom. The ending should be changed. He shouldn't freeze to death at the church. He grows up and becomes... A famous artist? That's not it. He grows up and becomes... He becomes an art teacher at a tiny school. - I can smell alcohol - It's a good job. You teach them how to draw and get paid for it. Right? Fuck! Damn it. Hello? Hey there. What are you doing in this shit hole? You're so young. I'm not young like you, Mister. Come on, don't mister me. You like me? The best way to get chummy is... You wanna fuck me? How many of his step moms did you fuck? Do I look that easy? You might be in heat, but I'm not. What I need the least is a man. So leave me alone. Give me a cigarette. Yeah, it's me. What is it? Really? Okay. I got it. Come here, asshole. - Fuck! - Come on! You piece of shit! I never did it before. What the... Disgusting son of a bitch... Fuck you. Get me some booze. Forget it. KIM Jae-su... People like you and me... We shouldn't have been born. No! No! Fuck off! No! No! You asshole! Keep it up and you'll end up like me. Your wife will run away, - and you'll be raising a kid alone! - That'll never happen to me! Son of a bitch! Keeping this book won't bring her back. It can't bring her back. She's dead! I know that! But I don't feel she's dead at all! Say she's dead. Say it! Say it now, son of a bitch! Say she's dead! She's dead. Louder! Mom is dead! You're pigheaded after your mom. Your real mom is dead. That slut is your mom now. Call her Mom. Call her Mom now. You won't? No? Come here. Call her Mom now. Go ahead. No? Do it. Whoever she is... If I say she's your mom, she's your mom! Mom! Say it! No? You called all the others Mom! Come here. Call this slut Mom. Call her Mom loudly. Now! No? Son of a bitch. Stop it, asshole! Stop it... That's enough... You should go to hell. Leave him the fuck alone! Are you crazy, bitch? God damn it! What's going on here? What are you? Are you his mother? What the... Shit, he's going crazy! What the hell are you doing? Move. Move. Move, asshole! Stay out of my sight, or you're dead! There are some hot patches in the bottom drawer. Use them for yourself. I'm fine. Use them for yourself! Are you okay? Any bone broken? That mean son of a bitch... He's dead if I get my hands on him! Got a cigarette? A cigarette? This is all I have. Hold on. Let me sterilize it for you. It'll be as good as new. Here you go. Let me light it. Why do you keep playing that? Just to entertain my ears. I used to like this singer a lot. I would cry, listening to his songs. I hate him. He has it all. But he's damn good with sad songs. Wait... You cried? You? Long ago. A theme park? It's homework. About what I do this weekend. I can make it up like always. But you're supposed to put pictures here. I don't have to. It's a lie anyway. Why don't we go to one? With black eyes? It'll be embarrassing. Ever heard of Marshal Beauty Parlor? I thought not. Across from there, there's this huge... Welcome to Everland! Wow, this is an Aesop's Village. What's that? It's a village in a fairytale. Oh, that Aesop... I know. An Aesop's Village! Free Family Photo Wanna check it out? You need a photo for your homework. You sit over here. Sit next to your son, Ma'am. Make yourself comfortable. Give me some smile. That's not quite good. How about this? Can you stand up for me? There you go. You put your arms around him. Like this... That's good. Pretend you're kissing your mom on the cheek. Come on, go head. Turn your face to the camera. Look here. That's good. And you pretend to kiss her. Show me some love. Good. - How is it? - Good. One, two, three... Smile! Aren't you brushing your teeth? I was going to. Do it now. It was really happy time. It's hard to determine at this point. It's not clear if it's cancer. I need to see all of your previous medical records. But what concerns me more is your blood sugar level. Rest as much as you can. What am I, a trash man? - Baek-jung! - What? You can put more in it. It costs to buy these trash bags. - Mom... - What? I saw this coming. She's not a step mom type. I'll get the change later! Excuse me? Here. Hi. - Hello. - Hello. God! That woman made this. What's wrong with him? Damn, I could've taken her out. It's mine! We should bring our moms for the talent show. It's Saturday so every mom should come. - Your moms are coming, right? - Yeah. - How about you? - My mom's coming, too. That's good. - What's up with him? - He pisses me off. I hate him. I understand she has to work. But can't she make it? It's a yearly event. Hello? Hi, is this Jae-su's mom? I'm the mother of his classmate. This Saturday is the talent show. I hope you can make it. You know the time, right? You got the wrong number. Hello? Literary exercises Look. Who is that? - Who is she? - I've never seen her before. She's Jae-su's mom. Jae-su, your mom is here. Jae-su? Why'd you come back? You're gonna leave me again! I'm sorry. I was just... Don't go, Mom! Mom? Mom... Are you crying? Yes. I cry when I'm truly happy. I promise 1. I won't skip meals. 2. I will draw everyday. 3. I will never smoke. Until when will you keep them? You'll quit smoking, right? Forever I guess I've smoked enough. I know you like this. It's quite easy to make. I've taken a lot of your food. I'm sorry. You're sorry now? What's the most important ingredient? - The sauce. - Right. If you've put in too much pepper? Put more sugar in. - Right. - But why? If you put in too much pepper, it's spicy and salty. When it's too spicy, sugar will make it mild. - Mild? - Yes. Where'd you learn to cook this? But I can cook almost everything that you can think of. - Try it. - Sure. If you saved it for later, don't eat it cold. Add some water and heat it up. It looks good. My mouth is watering. It's almost done. - You're good. - Wow! I can't die now. There's this child who needs me. All I want is just another year. No, 6 months. Doctor, I'll do anything. Mom! Mom! I've been looking everywhere for you. Come on. - Aren't you cold? - No. Where'd you go yesterday? I just went out to get some fresh air. You did? Are you sick again? You put on makeup. You look different with makeup on. Are you okay? We're almost there. She's hot, man. It's a bargain for you. She's healthy now. She's ready. Just set the date. Okay. Hi. Mom! Huh? Mom? God, she smells good. What the...! Did my dad come? Why look for him here? Jae-su, wait. What does your mom like? Pork? Fish? Damn... 'Damn'? Kids today are so rude. Damn kid... Why'd you leave it open? Where'd you go? I thought you left again. What's that? I got it from the community center. Look. They gave you this for free? On Sale, $499.99 Here's your pillow. Lie down. You spent your computer money? You fool! It's supposed to be good for diabetes. It makes you as healthy as a horse. I looked it up on the net. What? Go. Return it and get your money back. No way. You should take it, Mom. I don't need it. It won't work. Stop it! If you don't take it, I'll starve from today. What the... Bring her ASAP. I'll pay the rest on delivery. Do I need to count this? I can't believe you don't have a bank account. Can I order over the phone? All it takes is a push of a button, right? Yes. Oh, the address? Try to use chopsticks even when you eat alone. But I won't be eating alone anymore. Hello? It's me. Where the hell have you been? She didn't run, did she? Right. What's up with your voice? Did you eat? Yes. Pack her bag for me, okay? Why? Why what? You thought she'd live with us forever? Dream on. Mom! Mom! Mom! Are you okay? - Get out. - What's wrong? - I'm okay. - Are you sure? Let's get you inside. Lie down here.

Don't let him hit my poor Jae-su. Okay? Do it for me. You should eat better. Please... My poor Jae-su... Open it. What are you gonna do? Beat her up again? You call yourself a man?
