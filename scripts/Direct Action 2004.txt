We've been talking about men. What is it about men who live alone, with this morning's guest, Dr. Phyllis. What is it about these men and why do women find them irresistible? (Phyllis) Well, Tony, we're mostly talking about a man who's strong, who is up to himself and doesn't have a woman telling him what to do, how to live or dress, in truth, he may not have a lot of female companionship in his life. (Tony) Are you telling us this man is hard up for a date? (Phyllis) A man that functions on his own? That's attractive. (Tony) Many listeners are men and are driving in this morning, l bet they'd like to be driving in. Alright. We're talking about men with Dr. Phyllis, we'II have more after this!

You know what we're up against with these gangs. Look, l know some bad things went down but that's over now, okay? The guys that are responsible are off the Unit. Okay? We're handling it internally. You go outside, you spill your guts to the Federal Grand Jury and what do you do? What do you accomplish? You bring all this ugliness down on us on yourself, for nothing. Theft. Extortion. Murder. You call that nothing? Look, Frank, if it wasn't for us these streets would be in chaos. We're holding this city together like fucking super glue. You're not looking at the big picture here, Frank.

Got something to do with Stone? lt's like l said, Ross. lt's got nothing to do with you. Did l just lose 50 bucks? (Frank) l always wanted to be like him. That's why l joined the force. (Grimes) He was a hell of a cop. Yeah, well, He got his hero's funeral You know. That's the way things work. Yeah. Look, Frank, you're my partner, man. So whatever way you come down on this You know l'm with you, right? Yeah. l know. But if you think they're just gonna let you waltz into that hearing and shit all over them, you're dreaming. You're gonna end up on the wrong side of their guns. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. Okay. Stone just talked to Frank. Let's see how he wants to play. Okay? lt's gonna be okay? Sure it's gonna be okay. lf he wants it to be okay. [releases hammer of gun] (Carter) Excuse me. What did you say your name was again? Officer Ross. Ross. Where's Gannon? Out with Sgt. Grimes. Did he leave you stranded? lt's a bad sign, Ross. Hey. Whatever happens. l'm with you. Thanks, Ed. Gannon seems like a nice guy, but l don't think he's passed any trainees. Not that l can remember. Lieutenant. Do you remember any trainees being passed by Gannon? No. Hey, excuse me. Not now, Ross. [sighs] l should have bet 100. [both chuckle] Yeah. l know. No. l-- l know. l gotta call you back. l'll call you back. Hey. Frank. Good to see ya. That was, uh, that was quick. So? So l've decided to be a winner.

Hey. l'll tell you what. Let's do both of them. What the hell, huh? Remember the oath "To serve and protect the people of our city"? Yeah, sure, Why? l'm gonna be at that Courthouse. At five. Whoa, whoa, wait. Frank, Frank. Now listen. You don't wanna do that. Who the hell do you think is gonna believe you? Oh, l know.

You think that this is over my head? Try me. l'm starting to get a little pissed off. You don't want a reassignment? Fine. Call in sick. Call in sick? Light. Are we happy? Yeah. (Ross) Excuse me, Sergeant, but l do take it personally when l've been on the job, what? Two hours maybe? And you're just gonna dump me? lt's like l said, Ross. lt's nothing personal.

Can l help? Hey. Just keep your hands where l can see them guys. [chuckles] Frank, come on. We're all friends here. Aren't we? Sure we are. (Bryant) See? We just wanna offer a little roadside assistance. Maybe have a few words for old time's sake. You got something to say? Say it to the Grand Jury. Oh, Frankie, Frankie, l can't believe you just said that! (Espinoza) After all we've been through, l expected something else from you, l really did. [brakes screech and electric buzz] Oh, shit! (Bryant) Son of a bitch. (Espinoza) Get him up there. Come on. Shit. lt's gone. (Ross) Hey! Dammit! God! Pull it forward! Police Officer. Just go! Go! Go! Go! Come on ! Where are we going?

Yeah. All decorated veterans. So why didn't anybody say anything? Too much money around. People got greedy.

But we're dealing with them. You wanna take care of this, fine. No. No. l think we should move it up for today. Okay. Alright. Fine. l'll talk to you later.

Stone, l have a little concern about this Direct Action Unit investigation. Look, the Feds can investigate till their blue in their face. There's nothing there, Mr. Mayor. l'm going down there myself today. l'm gonna set the record straight. Damn good record, too. City's lowest crime rate in 30 years. That's quite an accomplishment. lt's one that makes us all look good, sir. Huh? [chuckles] You know, the Chief's thinking about, uh, retiring next year. lf the position was open, maybe you'd like to run. Uh. Clears throat. That, uh, that's very flattering, sir. Very flattering, but, uh, l'd have to give that some thought. Well, you think on it. There's a lot of big people behind you. They like you. They like you a lot. Well, good luck on this Grand Jury thing. Don't you worry about it, sir. (Lopresti) Gannon. It's about time you came in. (Katy) Oh, good. l really got to go. What do you think l'm running here?

What the hell would you do? Tell it to the Judge. All three of you. You know, l've been working on this, uh, DAU investigation for eight months. Eight fucking months! By 5 :00 this evening they were home free. Less than three hours and you couldn't lay low Gannon? There's something else going on. (Frank) l'm gonna find out what. No, you're not going anywhere. Nowhere! Do yourself a favor. Hand over your weapons. You too, Ross. (Frank) You don't give us orders. You listen to me, Gannon. lt's your word against seven decorated officers. Excuse me, four, since you fucking killed three of them. Your word doesn't mean a thing. not a God dammed thing. l don't know why l'm talking to you. Because your ass is in a sling. (Frank) l'll get some hard evidence on Stone, you get me to court. Excuse me. (Lopresti) lt's okay, let him go. Sorry. Let's go. You're not going anywhere. You know who you're up against. You need backup. You stay here and take care of your family, Ed. You know l would have testified if it wasn't for them. l know. [car keys] Did l hear something about backup? Ross. Stay here. Alright. No! A) lf you don't find that evidence, I don't have a career. B) Stone, he knew what he was doing when he put me in the car with you. and C) until the end of the goddamn day, l'm your partner! (Ross) So, now we're two cops who are now cop killers, and we've got a whole two hours to put some more cops and our own commanding officer in jail. That's about right. [chuckles] We've got three dead officers and two dead guys with AK 47s. And? And a van. Registered to Khalid Manseur. 455 Crescent Street Apartment 31 0. You're making progress, Ross. Thanks. 455 Crest. So tell me something, Ross. What's that, Sergeant? How come a college grad decided to become a cop? How did you hear that? l do my homework, Ross. [chuckles] Yeah, well, l guess this is what l always wanted to do, and with other little girls were playing with Barbies, l was playing cops and robbers. They all said l couldn't do it. Here l am. Well, you certainly are. Alright, Ross. Stay here. Cover me. l got it. [knocks] Police Officer! [knocks] Police! Open up! [blast] Sarge? Ah ! Shit. Ugh. Let's go, Ross. (Ross) Watch it! Yeah, l could go now. So l guess that's twice that l saved your ass. Huh, Sarge? So l guess we're even. Yeah. Sure you don't want some gum, Ross? What? l told ya, you don't know what you're missing. [siren] So what you got? Nothing on the van. No tickets. Nothing. (Grimes) No arrest record on this Manseur either. l'm waiting on DMV for a license photo. (Frank) l don't know, we run this Manseur through the system, government databases, the works. Okay buddy. You keep your head down. l'm trying. So what now, Sergeant? Well, l'm trying to think of something. You got a wife? Uh, no. Just thinking, if you had a wife or kids, you know. You got an idea or something? Hm. What? l think we're going to go and see an old friend. (Frank) Great. Great. But what is this and where's it from? A Kris. lt's called a Kris. An assassin dagger from Afghanistan. You know, Sergeant, Afghani men, they are fierce, very dangerous. Even this morning. What happened? Two Afghani girls. Murdered. (Espinoza) Khalid Manseur says hello. (Bryant) Say goodbye! (old man) Others died, too, massacred, they say. Massacred? Where? (old man) Up on Lyndon Hill. Bad people. Adrianna, where you are going? (old man) Tea. Tea. You must sit, have some tea, get to know her. She would make for you such a wife. (old man) She's very quick. She is very smart, she goes to business school. Sarge. Shit. (Frank) We haven't been here. lt's a secret. Big secret. Very big secret. Very big. Huge. Good. Top secret. You got it. (Frank) Yeah, that's right. A multiple homicide in Lyndon Hill this morning. That's right. Thanks, Ed. Alright, Ross. Let's go. Do you know what l heard about you? Yeah? What did you hear? People say things. Like what? They say you're hot. [chuckles] (Stone) So, uh, we all set for later? (Espinoza) Right here, baby. Right here. (male) l finally got that fax about the shipper, l pushed the paperwork through customs. (Stone) So everything's good? Yeah. (Stone) Great! 50 million. (Stone) Divided by-- Wait, wait, thanks to our pal Gannon, one, two, three, four, three shares for Khalid and his men, Uh. You're a genius. 50 million. What's that divided by seven? A lot. (Stone) It's a hell of a lot. Excuse me. l don't wanna bust any balls, don't mean any disrespect, but wouldnt it would be more fair if we each got a share instead of having to split one? l'm not asking for too much here. l've been working on this for five months. That's a good point. [chuckles] So Bryant. Bryant! What's 50 million divided by six? [all chuckle] You know we should stop meeting like this. l thought l owed you one. l got a call from one of the Marshalls, he said that you let Gannon go. l had no choice. This might be your investigation but l am the prosecutor here and if Gannon doesn't show up in court, it's my ass on the line, okay? l won't hesitate to call my superior and tell him that you've been stalling. There's a pattern here. You tell him what you want, sunny boy. Now you listen to me. l've worked for this government for over 20 years. All over the world, all kinds of service. Don't you give me any shit. If Gannon commits any more crimes you'll be an accomplice. He's a wanted man. Two and a half hours. 5:00 PM, if Gannon's in court you may have a career left. lf not, l won't hesitate-- Are you playing hardball with me? (Lopresti) l'll blow you off the fucking court, pal. You have no clue who you are dealing with. Lopresti, l'm just doing my job. This is not personal. Okay? lt's always how it is, isn't it? [phone rings] l gotta get this. Just think about what l told you. (Lopresti) Good day, Governor. How are you today? (Governor) Everything okay? Oh, yeah, l'm all over this Grand Jury thing. [chuckles] (Grimes) l've got the police report right here, Frank. 461 Western Ave. in Lyndon Hill. Multiple homicides, females, known prostitutes, two males, a security guard named James Aziz, and a Caucasian male in his fifties, all victims shot at close range. (Frank) Who's this Caucasian guy? I don't know. Nothing on him. What do you mean? (Grimes) Somebody came in and put a lid on the investigation. Ed, l'll get back to you. Feds? More than Feds. You stay here. l'll check it out. l'll cover you. (Frank) How're you doing? How am l doing? Yeah. Good. How are you doing? Good. Good. Sorry, Sergeant. This place is off limits. Says who? Says l. Oh, yeah? Yup. And who are you? None of your business. None of my business? None of your business. Yeah. Do me a favor. Call your boss, tell him you gotta see him right away. lt's real important. Okay. can l put the doughnuts down? Uh, Phil? We got a big 10-78 down here. Yeah. So Central lntelligence Agency. Huh? Uh-huh. You don't look like a Fed. Deep cover. Oh, yeah? (Phil) What's going on, Jackson? (Jackson) Uh, who's your friend. Nice to meet you. Hey, come here. What's this all about? (Jackson) I'II tell him if l were you, Phil. Shut up, Bill. They killed one of our agents up there. They killed all the girls. They killed a couple of guys. And they slashed our boy's neck. Alright. Thanks. Yeah. Any leads? We're looking for a girl. Another prostitute. (Phil) Here's the, uh, menu. She's number seven. Alright, Ross. Check out number seven. (Frank) What was your agent's name? (Phil) Don't take this personal, okay? But l really can't tell you. Ah, excuse me, Sergeant. (Ross) Your tea date? (old man) l am telling you the truth. My niece, she got homesick. She went back to Kazakhstan. l don't know anything more. (female) l'm so sorry l'm late-- Adrianna, run ! That's here! Turn in here. [guns shots] Ah ! [panting] Adrianna, l'm here to help you. My Uncle! My Uncle! l know. [sobs] Let's go. No! No. [cries] (Phil) So what's your name, buddy? Sgt. Gannon. (Ross) Look, guys. At least give us the name of your agent. You're going to the FB l with this? There's not enough time. Maybe l can contact my people about it. l n two hours? l don't think so. So, the cops who are after me are somehow connected to the Afghanis who killed your guy. Well, his throat was cut. Afghani style, so that's the working assumption. The Afghanis didn't kill them. What? Two other men killed them. l've seen them before. They were like you. Cops. Captain. Big problem. Gannon took the girl. He's got the girl? How did he know? Shit! Shit! [crack] You okay, Captain? Yeah. l'm fine. l just dropped the phone. [dials] [loud music] l can't believe this guy. What can't you believe? No honor. No loyalty. No honesty. What are you talking about? Honor? What? The guy's a cop! The guy's a rat! okay? He's starting to sing ! Smart up! Don't get my blood up, alright? lt's about you, and about me and about the money. lt's about us! That's it! Alright? Now you wanna do it. You do it now. (Grimes) Frank. l got the DMV photo and info back on this Khalid Manseur who owned the van. But there's something strange. Licenses are good for five years, but this was renewed only after one. The original was a diplomatic license. But I checked with Social Security. This guy's a mechanic. So why does a car mechanic from Lyndon Hill carry a diplomatic license? Good point. l'm going over to the DMV and have my guy run a full check on this. l'll find out. Watch yourself. (Grimes) You guys on your way back here? We'll be right there. Honey. Tell me you're not going. l gotta help Frank with something, honey. l'll be back in a half an hour. Besides, Frank is on his way over here. Okay? It'll be alright. [phone rings] (Espinoza) Frankie.

In 15 minutes l want you to be at the old tire factory. lf you're late, l'm gonna get nervous and gonna fucking kill them all. l don't wanna kill the children, do you understand me? So bring the hooker and it's all good. Looks like the boys got caught with their pants down. Yeah. They must've been sleeping on the job. (Jackson) Feds. (Phil) Yeah, Feds. (Grimes) Shit.

[phone rings] Stick to the plan. (Grimes) Yeah. I know what to do. Frank. l was part of it. Of what? Of the Unit. Let's just say l wasn't as thin as you. Alright? l needed the money. but l swear to God, l never shot anybody. l never killed anybody. This investigation, if something would've happened and you'd have found out later-- l just don't want you to think that l wasn't on your side, man. l was always on your side. Partners. Right? Okay. You know what to do. Yes, sir. (Espinoza) Hold it right there, Frankie boy. He's clean. (Espinoza) You goddamn fuck. What were you thinking about? (Espinoza) You cast us a bunch of shit, Frankie boy. Where is the girl? You first. So Frank, you've been kind of rough on the work force, pal. (Stone) That's how l got drafted into this. (Stone) But hey, you me, the guys. All together again.

Let's go. (Frank) They'll be here in five minutes. Frank. l don't wanna testify. (Frank) l just want the money, like you. (Bryant) Do you think we're fucking brain dead? (Espinoza) No. No. No. Sh. Sh. Sh. What are you saying, Frankie boy? Are you saying you're in? Yeah. What the fuck are you saying, bitch. Go ahead. What are you saying? Let's hear him out. Are you saying you're in, Frankie boy? [brakes screech] [gunshot] Agh ! (Stone) Go! Yeah ! Uncle Frank! You'll be fine. Come on, kids. (Katy) Where's Daddy? Just go. Just go. (Frank) Come on.

(Bryant) What the hell do we do now? (Stone) Just listen to me and remember, As long as we get the money we get on that plane, then screw everybody and everything. We just gotta get through this, okay? Just keep your mind on the money. Everything is good? Yeah. Everything's great. And the rest of the men? With the law. What? They didn't fucking make it, okay? Didn't make it. Look on the bright side. There's more money to go around. Okay? And that should take the sting outta of it. Millions. Yeah. [sighs] Okay. Show time. (Stone) l know you're hurting, pal. But hang in. Money will make it all better. (male) Did you hear me crying for my mother? Yo, it's Bill. l got a situation. (Bryant) Mr. Woo. This is Khalid Manseur. (Woo) Mr. Manseur. Your reputation precedes you. We'll check the goods first. Partners. No, Frank! You know who you are up against. l'm a caring kind of guy. (Grimes) Partners. (Grimes) Right. l know it doesn't help, but it's not your fault. He chose to do this. This is what he wanted to do. He wanted to stand up for what was right, just like you, Sarge. (Jackson) l got something. We, meaning the Agency, ran this task force in Afghanistan, in the 80s, named after a freedom fighter killed by the Russians. Khalid Manseur. Now, eight agents, some of the local, some of them Americans all used that same code name. Get a load of this. (Ross) Khalid Manseur, two faces, two licenses, same name. (Ross) l guess that they were part of that Afghani task force. l guess so. Your agent killed this morning? He's probably on it too. l'll know pretty soon. They'll give me a list of all the agents involved. (Ross) And I found this on one of the guys. lt's an internet map. What is that for? l was thinking that it was a symbol, or a date or the time, maybe 4:00 o'clock. 20 minutes. You think that's where they are? Why don't we just wait for the Feds? Where are you guys going? What about Loretta? The kids? Adrianna? You take care of them. Jesus, l'm a government agent, not a baby sitter. (Frank) Bring some fire power. Meet us at l-5 exist 60. That's right. l n 15 minutes. Well, that's all the time you got, Lopresti. Excellent. Now we can do business. (Bryant) Don't worry. l'm on it. Alright. Look. l'll take care of my end, you take care of your end. The thing is, we gotta find them. We gotta go in without Lopresti. Without backup? You okay with that? Absolutely. Hey, Sarge. l'll take some of that gum now. How many guys you got? (Lopresti) Tactical unit choppering up. Until then l only got four. l'm lucky we got four. My balls are on the goddamn vice here. Alright. Now listen. l'm sorry about Grimes. That's a shame. Yeah. Bring your guys up here in front. l'll hook around the back. l wonder where that tactical unit is. l'll give them a call. Alright. Do that. (Lopresti) You know. l needed this contact, Frank. Stone's a fool. I'm not. Sorry. [gunshots] What is that? That's hunters. l's hunting season. Let's just finish this. We're almost there. Out! Get out! Ross! Back here! Come on. Agh. (Ross) Lopresti. He was the leader of that Afghani task force. He's in the shit. Deep. (Lopresti) You're nothing, cop. You got in the way! l had the deal of a lifetime. [gunshots] [horn] l'll trade you. Oh, shit! [crack] Ugh ! [spits] Ugh ! [pants] Shit. [groans] Ah ! Do good rookie. Get up! [groans] Come on !

[gunshots] [groans] (Frank) Ross? Shit. (Stone) The US Attorney here would have you believe there are some easy answers to be had. Well, l'm here to tell you that there aren't. We were at war, ladies and gentlemen. A war for your streets, a war for your homes, a war for your very lives. And this Unit would do whatever it takes, whatever is necessary to keep you safe. Now we are winning that war. And that's really all that matters here. l instead of investigating us, they should be pinning medals on us. Yeah ! Yeah, M r. Mayor. It went great. Everybody's gonna come out smelling like a rose. Yeah. [chuckles] Well, thank you, sir. You, too. Looking sharp, Captain. Well, thank you, Frank. Does that mean we're gonna be adult about this? How'd you like a share, Frank. Now that's 12.5 million dollars. Not too shabby. What do you say? You certainly earned it. You want justice, is that it, Frank? Fine! l got some justice for you. It was justice for you. Good luck, Frank. For the record, state your name, please. My name is Sgt. Frank Gannon. Okay, Sgt. Gannon, could you tell this hearing everything you know about the Direct Action Unit? (Reporter) Sgt. Gannon's testimony has lead to widespread investigations into official corruption in both city and federal levels. (Katy) Hey, look. There's Uncle Frank. He's on TV! Hello! Helped discover the Afghanistan drug ring are being praised by the Mayor and City Hall. (male over TV) l'm assuring the people of this city, as long as we have people like this, coming up to it, there's nothing we can't accomplish. There's nothing that we cannot do. This city needs more people like this. Real cops. Real citizens. Real heroes. l'm assuring the people-- Hey. So how are you feeling, Ross? l'm alright. You look good. Well, the Mayor said you were a hero, l guess, so-- You'll get your shield after all. Yeah? Yeah. And you? Well, they wanna make me a Lieutenant, so. l'm still thinking about it. It means l gotta go back to school. Well, if you need any help with your homework. Yeah. Hey, uh, by the way, what's your, uh, first name, Ross? Billie. Billie? Yeah. it's nice. It suits you. Thank you, Sarge. You can call me Frank. So, uh, once you're back on your feet, you wanna-- Do you wanna have some dinner? Dinner? Yeah. You know that thing between lunch and breakfast? l'd love to. Alright, uh, I know just the place.
