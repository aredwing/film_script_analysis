Cos that's exactly what a bunch of kids did. They changed London. And they changed their lives. On Top Of The World If you love somebody Better tell them while they're here Cos they just may run away from you I've had the highest mountains I've had the deepest river You can have it all but life keeps moving Now, take it in but don't look down Cos I'm on top of the world, 'ey I'm on top of the world, 'ey Waiting for this for a while now Paying my dues to the dirt I've been waiting to smile, 'ey Been holding it in for a while, 'ey Take it with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child And I know it's hard Been holding it in for a while Take it with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child I'm on top of the world - All right, Dad? - You all right, son? Yeah. - See you still got me old bike. - Yeah, I polish it every day. Good boy. How's your mum? Yeah, she's fine. So... Right, well, same deal as before. 50/50 down the middle. Yeah? Yeah, cheers. The mugs at school won't know any different. It's not a problem. Just remember, there's no-one like you, son. All right? You're living the dream. I'm all about the dream. Coolest Kid Stop! OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Party people in the place He's the coolest kid alive Oh, my gosh! Have you seen how much style this kid's got? It's insane! He's popular Yeah, yeah, yeah Party people in the place, he's the coolest kid alive Yeah, yeah, yeah Party people in the place, he's the coolest kid alive Never met a kid that's as cool as that He'll make the girl jump from the front to the back His skin's so soft like banana skin I wanna see the room jump when the party begins... Breakfast is served my friends. Pay up, pay up. Just 1 and taste North Korean chocolate that's gonna make you even more intelligent than you already are. Chelsea boo thai wok. As they say. - What language is that? - It's the language of deliciousness. 95% off. Everyone get to class. Not you, Ethan. I should have known it was you peddling this filth. Got anything to say? I'm truly happy to announce a further 4% off to all the teaching staff. I'm happy to announce that you're going to see the headmaster. Come on. Chop, chop. - I'll give you 99%... - Shut up. You realise the nightmare you have created with these? Headaches, stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea... In many ways, sir, I've done you a favour. Any kid that buys toxic chocolate from the black market must lack intelligence. All I've done is help you identify those in need of academical assistance. You can farm them off to the school down the road and your Ofsted chart thing will go through the roof. And you know what, sir? It will all be thanks to me. Did someone say "outstanding"? Sir? Did someone say "pay rise"? No. But someone said detention. - I don't think they did, sir. - Detention. Speak Of The Devil Now it's probably time to talk about dancing. Dancing was Jaden's thing. The thing that made him feel alive and... well, happy. Since he'd been banned by his parents, it was the thing he couldn't stop thinking about. It would jump into his head at the slightest opportunity. That little angel on your shoulder ls telling you to dance Come on, you know that you wanna Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! Welcome to the Garage. Welcome to my place. I set this place up for kids like Jaden to come to and just, well, be themselves. Hey. Aerosols! Noxious. - Don't be such a baby, Tim. - Oh, come to momma! Come on! I honourably request that you bite me. Ow! Unfortunately, there were a lot of people who wanted to knock this building down. Do we have to go through the whole thing again? The thing is, though, Councillor Tarrington, some of these kids don't actually have anywhere else to go after school. This place is still going to be demolished. What's in it for you? A wee backhander, is it? A wee... Let's pretend you didn't say that. This is... This is the only youth centre around here. The community here really needs us. It also needs parking spaces. Oh, come on! Surely kids are more important than parking spaces? Parking spaces bring in more revenue. Anyway, you've still got a couple of weeks before the demolition. I expect I'll see you at the council meeting on the 20th. It'd be a great opportunity for you to beg for mercy and be ignored. Fantastic. Look forward to it. Mm. Goodbye, Gina. Yo, blood. Who the heck is that? Don't even ask. - Shutting it down, aren't they? - I've got to raise a lot of money. And there is literally nobody else in the world that I can ask. Are you still sure we couldn't, you know, tal... Oh, Jaden. Not the talent thingy again. Come on! We put on acts from the Garage and sell tickets. There's so much talent here, Miss Gina. I don't have the man power. I don't have enough hands to organise something like that. You'd need someone who can do stuff and get stuff. - I could do it. - Jaden! You know I'm all about empowerment and everything but you look about eight. Sorry. Maybe eight's a wee bit harsh. Eight and a half. - Thanks for that. - All right. Rah. She's On Fire Oh! She's on fire! She's every man's dream and my desire She's like the candy that your daddy told you you can't touch Oh! She's on fire! Just tell me how do I make her love me And still stay loyal to the game? Fresh cans, Taylor. - How did you get these? - I can sort anything. Remember that. Enjoy, man. - Ethan! - Squirt. So tell me, who's this super-fit chick just joined our school? She's called Lucy. - She's very unintelligent. - She only dates dancers. - And she already has a boyfriend. - All of these, minor obstacles. Thanks, Squirt. Squirt? Speak Of The Devil Whoa-oh That little devil on your shoulder Whoa-oh ls telling you to dance Whoa-oh Come on, you know that you wanna Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! This came for you today. Looks really good. Wish I went to a school like that. I tell you what, son, if you get into that school, you can do anything you want with your life. Yeah, apart from be able to relate to girls. He's funny. You're going to breeze through that entrance exam. - Is that my old dance stuff? - Yeah, I found it in the attic. Figured you don't need it anymore so I'm going to give it to charity. Jay, we pulled out all the stops for you to go to this school. All right? So you need to focus. No distractions. And no more dancing. Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. You've got a brilliant imagination, son. Use it for something proper. U Love Your Sneakers You love your sneakers more than you love me You love your sneakers more than you love me You like all them girls looking down at your feet... Check the sneaker magazine... Cos you love your sneakers more than you love me I'll get it. It's cool. All right, Dad? Yeah, I'm good. You? We still on for tomorr...? All right. Yeah, it's cool. Right, then. Yeah. Gotta go as well. In a bit. Bye. It was Dad. Tomorrow, it's not going to happen. I'm just gonna go to my room and pretend to do homework, yeah. Oh, I got a letter from school. Just put it... Great. What trouble you in now? Why do you always assume it's bad? Sorry. I'm just tired. Long day. Well, it is bad, so happy reading, yeah. What's that game called? Looks well weird. Yeah, man, it's Space Invaders. It's retro. It's from World War Two, before they had phones. Cool. Chips or mash? Chips or mash? Chips or mash? - Chips or mash? - Sorry I'm not hungry. Ethan. Ethan! Ethan. Ethan. Do I know you? - I'm Jaden. We're in the same year. - Really? - Yeah. I know you're good at scams. - Don't make me blush. It's about the Garage. You go there, don't you? Are you my stalker? I need you to help me organise a talent show to raise money for repairs. - What's in it for me? - A happy feeling? Listen, I'm going to get that happy feeling when that place gets demolished. It sucks. Oh! She's on fire! Just tell me how do I make her love me And still stay loyal to the game? Wild Boyz Word UP, Ya- Pardon? Wagwan. Wagwan, Lucy. - Who the hell are you? - I'm Ethan. Did you follow me here? No, that'd be weird. I just come down, checking out the competition. Oh, you mean Fool of the Year competition? Well, congratulations. You are clearly the winner of that. No. You're the competition. It's a dance thing, yo. Me and my crew, we're tight. - You sound like you're in Glee. - More like Glee beebies. Give him a chance. So you're good, then, are you? We're as good as you are bad. - Are you dissing me? - Are you being dissed? Maybe I should film you being dissed. Hm. It seems my phone has been mislaid. Doesn't matter. I'm gonna film you with my mind. Let's be honest, word play just ain't happening. We need to battle for real. So just set the time and place and we'll be there. Until then... get lost. And, please, don't say anything else. My head hurts. See you. Bye. Go and annoy your parents. Cheerio. Bye. - Hi, Gina. - Ethan! I've got to get my phone. I forget it. I'm sorry. - We're closed. - Bye. See you. It's in the lost property drawer. Bring Me Back Oh, Lord Oh, Lord Won't you bring me back? Won't you bring me back? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, Lord, won't you help me get on track? The devil gotta hold on me Won't you bring me back? Oh, Lord, won't you help me get on track? The devil got a hold on me Won't you bring me back? Oh, Lord, won't you help me get on track? The devil got a hold on me Won't you bring me back? Won't you bring me back? Won't you bring me back? Won't you bring me back? Won't you bring me back? Won't you bring me back? The devil got a hold on me Won't you bring me back? Want to see something Eminem-tal? Like the cheese with holes? That's emmental, you idiot. I'm talking about Eminem-tal. That old American rapper and mental just... - Don't really work, does it? - Nah. Not really. Forget that and check this. - You can't show that to anyone. - Did someone say YouTube? Please, don't. Listen up. Here's the deal. I want to impress the fittest girl at this school. Oh! She's on fire! She's already going out with this total idiot called Kurt. He's in a crew. I need to beat him in a dance battle and I need a crew to do it. But I can't dance and I don't have a crew so... Help me, Jado-wan. You're my only hope. Don't dance. - Duh! It is so there. - In public I mean. Can't. Promised my parents. What if you can do something for me? Apart from deleting that. Now we're talking. Shoot. You help me put on that talent show. Nah, man. That's way more than any... Hold on. Wait. I'll help you put together a crew. Your battle against Kurt could be the main event. What is the point of beating him if no-one's watching? You know that... that does sound pretty Eminemtal. - One condition. - What's that? You delete the clip and I don't dance at the show. - That's two. - Your point is? I'm obviously not going to shake on... I didn't really spit. Just for effect, innit? Not in a million years. Please! Please, please, please, love... ..lovely, lovely Gina. You make me laugh but I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw you. - That's only because you're weak. - Look, the answer is no! But you trust me. Don't you, Gina? - And we're a team. My assistant, Jaden. - Equal. Equal. OK. This is the organised guy you said I needed. I can't do this. What are you... No! No! No, don't... Stop it! Stop looking at me. No! Oh, all right, fine! Woo! Thanks. - Oh, I'm too old for this. - Yeah. What are you? 30? I'll take that. - Yeah, I love this sound. - What? - Got some skills. - Yeah, but is it entertainment? - What's your problem? - You got it wrong! You said it wrong! Next! Hello, Jaden. Hello, Ethan. I wanna be your friend. Back on track. - That's more like it. - He's wheely good. Get it? Wheely... good. Wheely, wheely. Please, no puns today. What is it? It's all these acts, yeah. They're amazing but... I still need my dance crew, remember? Don't worry. I got your back. Dancers coming up. Next! Kudiye Punjab Diye Thank you. We'll... We'll be in touch. - They were great I thought. - Who cares? It's street dancers I need. Good street dancers are already in crews. Well, how is that going to work? Look, we've still got a few to go, so we'll find people. Carmen Prelude Ow! The point, Timothy, is to avoid my feet. It's hard. They're so big and manly. - My feet or yours? - Yours, obviously. Ow! Mummy! Mummy! - Who's got big feet? - You do. - Who's got big feet? - You do. Mummy! - Tim and Rebecca. - Aren't they brother and sister? Big feet! You've got big feet! Ha! Ha! Nice balance. Huh. It's just Amy. I've known her since we were in nappies. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! O-Our table is b-broken. That was really great, Amy. It's just not what we're looking for. - I really want to help you, Ethan. - Security, maybe. We need someone big and tough on the door. - But I don't want to be on the door. - What doorman ever does? What? It's a no. I'm sorry, Squirt. Last audition over. And not one street dancer. I'm doomed. Um... Am I too late to audition? Er, yeah, sorry, mate. - What's your name? - Brian. And you can dance? Yeah, and I do music. Remixes. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm just not sure your image is right for us. You look like a rapper going on a hunt. Come on, give him a chance. I've Got The Stuff I got the stuff Move your body I... Yes, I can feel that beat It's time to... Move your body I've got the stuff Move your body Shut up and dance Whoa. The track was amazing. How come you're not in a crew? None of them wanted me because I'm fat and they think I dress weird. And I can't really dance. Well, I can't argue with any of that. How would you like to join one? What? I'm sorry. One minute. What? The music was amazing. He's keen and talented. He's talented and... How am I meant to be taken seriously with... him in my crew? I'm meant to look cool. Is that what you think dance is about? Yeah. Hmm... His dancing, though, it's mental. Enthusiasm counts for a lot. OK, mate, you're in. Oh, that's... that's cool! Thanks, guys. I'll see you soon. So that's me, that chubby kid in tweed and maybe you. OK, not you. You got any ideas? We may need to think outside the box here. Welcome to the All Stars. Wooh! Wooh! Wooh. Atchoo! Why are we called that? Although you have completely different talents, you're... All stars. Brilliant. That's the dumbest name for anything I've ever heard. Peanut? I can't. I'm allergic to them. Chocolate? I'm also lactose intolerant. Lolly? I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. We're battling another crew, man. We'll beat them and people will pay to watch. This crew's what's gonna save the Garage. Ethan, don't know how to dance. Then why are you here? Look, Rebecca and I are used to putting in hours of training so your little road dancing thing will be no problem. - It's called street dance. - Sure it is. But who else have I got to dance with? You, king of the burgers, madam ninja - no of fence. None taken. I do love burgers. Taken! One more comment like that and I'll smack you back to St Trinians. - Sorry. Did you just threaten me? - It's on, hockey sticks. Er, Amy. Please. All right. So who's going to make up the dancing? She means the choreographer. - Jaden. - Sorry, do you even dance? - I used to. - Prove it. But it stays between us. This is ridiculous. Whoa! Whoa! Yeah. Whatever. - All right? - Hi. - Squirt, you gonna practise? - Yeah. - What happened to your bike? - Oh, it's broken. BIGkids: Heart Sing I was just a young boy looking for a way in You were just a young girl looking for a way out Always kept my hood up Tried to keep my head down Park Life on my iPod playing Now I see that you're perfect for me How did I miss ya? You're the only one who makes my heart sing You can make my heart sing You make my heart sing That's why I love you, darling Heart sing, you can make my heart sing You make my heart sing... Right. Let's get started. Yeah, I think we're missing someone. - Hello. - Oh, hey, Brian. How you doing? Oh, hey, Tony. Yeah, cool, mate. I will have... the usual, please. - Oh, one Brian special coming up. - Cheers. How's the family doing? - They're good, thanks. - That's good. Cool. See you tomorrow. Sorry. Bad traffic. Do the robot. Yeah, more robotic. Kurt's crew do great robot moves. We have to be better than them. OK, try beeping. Yeah, that's not very robotic. We need to go back to basics. I know just the place. Come. OK. Let's get military. Physical agility and balance. I'm going to split you into two units. Amy, you're with me. Recon. - Got it. - Ethan, you follow with the rest. - Elite squad. - Kind of. - Rendezvous... other side of that log. - You mean four feet over there? - You got a problem with that, soldier? - No, sir. Good luck. Elite squad, 90, 90! Rebecca, you might want to touch up your makeup just a bit. Just like... here. - Your time is coming, karate kid. - How did we do? I thought we were quite military, actually. - Oh, gotta go. - What? I've got a mock exam. My parents are gonna kill me. I have to try and revise. I've got 20 minutes. OK, bye. Is training over, sir? I'm gonna be late for golf, sir. Can I... Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - All right, cool. Well, right, say a boy wanted to ask a girl on a date. OK. What would be a cool thing to do on a date? You know, the perfect first date. Well, you start with a meal. A Meat Feast pizza to share. Then a movie. It doesn't have to be too girly. Finally, a walk home under the street lamps. Holding hands. They share a kiss. Maybe they don't. - Yeah, Lucy would love that. - Lucy? Yeah, I'm trying to come up with the perfect first date for when we beat Kurt and she dumps him. But... Thanks, Squirt. Cheers for all the advice. Much appreciated, yeah? - Sure you've been revising, Jaden? - Yeah. Just so much revision. There's this guy - Ethan. He's doing the exam as well. We're revision buddies. - No dancing or anything? - Absolutely not. Well, he filled about 12 in right. Yeah. Out of 200. Still got three days, though. Coming to the Garage? Dunno. My dad's meant to be picking me up, innit. He's... He's not the most reliable guy. - Don't think he's coming. - Parents suck sometimes. You know. Your mum and dad still on your back about the test thing? They want me to go to a private school. It's gonna be the end of my life. Who cares what parents think? I couldn't care less if my dad turns up today or not. You know why? Cos I'm my own man. My own guy. You get me? They think I'm revising tonight. Let's go to the Garage and crack your dancing. - What's wrong with it? - Pretty much everything. All right. - Let's do this, man. - Mm-hm. - Just checking no-one's watching. - Oh, come on, man. - What...? - Follow me. Five, six, seven, eight. Right foot. Left. Right. Jump. Go like that. Around. Here. Jump. And groove. OK, this is my dance space. This is your dance space. You're over my dance space like a rash. Let's go again. Six, seven, eight. One, two... What are your feet doing? Forget your feet. Oh, come on, control your feet, man. What? Mate, you literally just said forget your feet. Forget my feet. Yeah, forget them. But... control them. Now flow with it. Let me lead you. I don't know what that means but... Dude! - You're in heaven right now. - No, I'm not. - I'm really not comfortable. - Hey, that's it. Groove. Make it flow. - I don't want to do that any more. - Your back. Make it flow. - Did this just get weird? - Yes. Let's do it one more time. Come on. Six, seven, eight. Wow. Ethan! I'm genuinely amazed. Yeah, Jaden's improving. Yeah, keep up the good work, man. Seven, eight and... bigger... Harder. Less back. - Well, back off a bit! - OK, princess. I'm gonna take you down all the way to China Town. I don't even know what that means. Neither do I, but it won't stop me doing it to your face. So-called crew is a joke. You two think you're more awesomer than the rest of us, don't you? First of all, "awesomer" isn't even a word. Google it. And secondly, yeah, we do, you... chubby funster. - Oi! Can we all just calm down? - No! I refuse to share a stage with a bunch of lamoids, look stupid in front of a ton of people. Not for the Garage. Not for you, Ethan. Not for anyone. Come on, Tim. We're out of here. - You are not the boss of me. - Now, Tim! Right. Maybe I'll just catch her. - Don't think you'll ever be a crew. - You know what? On our own, you're probably right, but that's why we need you in the crew. I said I'm not dancing. Just give me one more chance to convince you. Please. - So where are we going again? - Some kind of a dancing show? - Do we start looking cool now? - Shh. All right, mate? Sorry. Such a low voice. Sorry. How old are you guys? Do your mums know you're here? - Yeah. - You're not getting in. But I'm a mate of the DJ. Which one? - Bob. - Bob? Bob the DJ? Yeah, we're big fans of Bob the DJ here. Whatever. That's a tenner each. Hurry, you might get the last bit of the show. - Show? - Cybernetic. - They're relatively good at dancing. - Do you have change for two 50s? Are you ready? Lose it I'm just shakin' my derriere Are you ready? Lose it! I'm just shakin' my derriere Are you ready? Lose it! I'm just shakin' my derriere Are you ready? Lose it! I'm just shakin' my... Whoa I'm just shakin' my derriere Lose it! Is that the opposing team? Are you ready? Lose it! I'm just shakin' my derriere Are you ready? So how long until the show again? Just under two weeks. How are we supposed to get that good by then? Took me four weeks just to learn how to tie my shoelaces. Actually, I gave up trying after four weeks. I'm rocking the bad-boy Velcro now. Those are fantastic Velcro shoes. So, enjoy the show? Clouds of Lynx... on that dancing man. So this must be that amazing crew you won't shut up about. - Wait till you see what we can do. - Where will I be able to do that, little sidekick? Two weeks from now. Garage talent show. A venue as truly lame as you. - What you saying about the Garage? - It's full of gimps. Like you. You're a genius, man. - If you wanna bottle it... - I didn't say that. You don't have to go through with this, Kurt. Be a pleasure destroying you in front of your home crowd. - I bet you can't even dance. - Yeah, well, I can. But you're not even in the crew. Allergic to Lynx. We're out of here. See you later, Ethan. She's definitely unintelligent. Yeah. - We have to beat 'em. - I know. - I'm in. - Yeah! I knew it! Did I miss anything? KensCrew Whoa. How was that? No. Still doesn't feel like a fight. Go through it again. You guys, come on. - Yo, Jaden, what's good? - Liking your new style. Crumpoeira. It's like crumpin' and capoeira but just together. You're still funny. I need advice. I'm helping someone out. Trying to train a crew. - You're training another crew? - Yeah. So you're not allowed to dance with us but you're able to train another crew? None of them can dance. Like... l want to help them but... Well, you can see my problem. Well, what can they do? Argue with each other. Be distracted. And eat too much. Anything else? Um, I dunno. Some kind of martial arts. Weird ballroom moves in terrible clothes. Chubby jiggling around. Then they can dance. - No, they can't. I've tried. - Tried what? To teach them, to change them. It ain't the same thing. In fact, they're kind of opposite things. I don't get it. Think about it. So why are we dressed like this? You know what'll make this crew win? We will. By doing the things we already do. Amy, kick me. What? Huh. Come on. Kick me with one of those spinny... See how graceful that was. That was dance. Brian, play us some music. Something Amy-ish. Now dance to it using what you do. That's it. Keep going. Come on. Keep going. Now everyone do it. This is super duper. I wish you were in our crew, Jaden. Maybe I am. Keep it quiet. Whoa! I can't believe you're in our dance crew, Jaden! I'm so happy you're dancing again! Oh, oh. Keep it quiet. Keep it quiet. Yeah. Whoa! - My dad spent ages collecting this. - Yeah, man, what is all this junk? How comes your CDs are so massive? Cos they're records. Vinyl? - Vi-nyl? - Here. I'll show you. Check My Style Oi! You've got to do the music for our final routine. - On one condition. - Yeah, what's that? My style has to be in there. Brian's styles got to represent. - Yeah. - Cool, man. Brian's style. Brian's style. Check my style. Yeah. Or we could do this. You've got a lot to learn, my friend. Five, six, seven, eight. Car! Cor, that was close. Bring all your empty pockets Step outside Here comes a falling star Better hold your hands out wide Every single sparkle Contains a dream come true All is change for me and you... So much poise. So much grace. They glide. Dressing like this is fine for them. They don't mind looking stupid, but me... You have to forget about what looks cool. Like this. - May I have this dance? - Why certainly, my darling. Oh, my days. All is change for me and you Jaden! Refreshers. Keep your blood sugar up. Cool. Knock 'em dead, son. Thanks. Pencils down now, please. I said pencils down. How did it go? Really, really well. Finished early. Well done, matey. I knew you wouldn't let us down. And spin. One, two, three... - Yeah, not bad. - Yeah, you're not that bad. - What you listening to? - My Van Halen. - Is that a rapper? - No, man. She's a DJ. Plays guitar music. And my dad's well into her. OK. Let's keep dancing. Why are you in my dance space? Because your dance space is going to be demolished this weekend. Hello, Mr Workman. Can I help you? I'm just taking some readings so the demolition goes smoothly this Saturday. We haven't had the appeal yet. We might stop this whole thing. Yes, that's right. Because the appeal process is very fair. Yes, there's a very good chance that we will not definitely be destroying this building on Saturday. When exactly was this decided? These guys are having a talent show on Saturday with hundreds of people coming. Yeah, well, maybe one of the acts can be a bulldozer driving through the walls? - I'll show you the way out. - Whatever. We're finished, anyway. OK, guys, let's clear out! All right, boys. Tools down. - Whoa. - Yeah, yeah. - Wait! She's gonna win the appeal? - Yeah, she's good at that stuff. I'm more worried that she thinks hundreds of people are coming. - No-one even knows about it. - We need to make those posters. - Better versions of those posters. - Yeah, about that... - What? - I know. The graffiti guys did it. But we can't afford to get them printed. We need big, we need colour, we need money. What you need is me. - Good morning, Ethan. - Hello, sir. Sorry about this. You know where you're going, don't you? - We're bunking off school! I feel so... - Rebellious. - No, sick. I'm gonna puke. - Man up, Timothy. So here we are again, Ethan. Indeed. Wait here. Psst. There you are. Come on. We don't have much time. Wow. Your school stinks of sweat mixed with gravy. Your gym makes me sad and your canteen don't even have sushi. I prefer pies. And I like our gym. Now come on. - I don't know what Angela's playing at. - Quick. Hide. Yeah, I'm onto it. I'm gonna ring the parents, actually. I'll get onto it now. It's pink. And there's no wee things. And it smells... ..nice. We're in the girls' toilets. Yeah, that's what he said. Wow, that was a bit pointless. Yeah, I know. So that's it? You didn't say anything else? This is the worst moment of my life. - Clearly I spoke too soon. - Sorry. Happens when I'm nervous. - Someone in there? - No. Just me. A girl doing a wee sitting down. Then why can't I see your feet? Oh, I don't have any. Then how'd you get in there? I hopped. - That's one leg. Not no legs. - Sorry! Wow, that was a bit pointless. You really are a couple of very strange boys. You know that? Staffroom. The printers are in there. Where is he? - Whoo! - Shh. You... took your time, sir. Whoo. Well, this is me. - Is your dad in? - Kind of. - Kind of? - See you later, Ethan. - It was great. - OK, yeah. See you. Dad, I'm home. Did you have an all right day? I had a good day. Fish fingers OK again? You taken your pills yet? You should have seen what we did. We made these amazing posters. We nearly got caught but it's fine. And Ethan gave me a lift home afterwards, which was, you know... nice of him. Sounds great, sweetheart. It was. It really was. How was your day, Dad? Really good. My heart overflows I only dream of you and me It's just you and me It's just you and me And dance combat begin. - ..Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - Ow! Ow! One, two, three, four... Ow! Ow. Amy, you hurt my feelings. This is completely ridiculous. - You like him, don't you? - What? No. He's Ethan. Look, I know we don't exactly have a lot of things in common. I like putting on makeup and wearing dresses. You like punching people in the face. But I can help you with this. So what do I do? Problem is, when he looks at you, he sees the girl he's known his whole life. - The one who lives next door. - The squirt. Now, I'm not saying change who you are, not for a boy. - You just need him to notice you again. - How? Kind of like... You Tellin' Me You Love Me What's wrong with you? You just look different. Whatevs, Ethan! Deal with it. You're the dew in my eyes Imagine to my great surprise You telling me... you love me And now I thank my lucky stars Cos you're rockin' in my arms And you're telling me... I... can't believe you're telling me You're telling me You love me - This place is so real. You feel me? - Feel you? No, thanks. Guys, man. Just listen up. OK, so we're here to learn about some b-boy attitude. A big part of b-boy and his MCing. The two are inseparable, really. - Like Shostakovich and timpani? - Right. Let's just do some rapping. - How on earth do we do that? - Take something you like. Anything. - Bikes. - OK. So just be like riding my bike is the t'ing that I like, don't ride no trikes because I'm down with my... - Spike. - Bike, man. - Yeah. That's hot. - That does sound easy. - Think you could do it, Timothy? - I hate being called that. Go on, then. OK. Right. So I quite like fishing, fly fishing. Fly fishing, gonna get more fish than I've been wishing. Boom. What's wrong with that? Yeah, but, Tim, fly fishing, man, that's... that's already a thing. Uncle Hector does it. With big wellies. So I thought this whole MC thing was about breaking rules. - Yeah, that's right. - OK, check it. Fly fishing, fly fishing, gonna get more fish than I've been wishing. What's this in my hand? A fat cookbook. Who's that stuck on my hook? It's you. Break it down. Yeah, man. Whoo! Dreamers I can find my place in my dreams Said I can find my place in my dreams Yo, yeah I don't care what you choose as fact I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back In my dreams, my dreams, my dreams, my dreams My dreams, my dreams, my dreams, my dreams Straight up into the sun I'm a spaceman, yeah, with a suit to match In my dreams, my dreams, my dreams, my dreams My dreams... - A salad, please. - What? - A salad? - Yep. I'm a healthy dancer now. I can find my place in my dreams Said I can find my place in my dreams I don't care what you choose as fact I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back In my dreams, my dreams, my dreams, my dreams My dreams, my dreams, my dreams, my dreams Straight up into the sun I'm a spaceman, yeah, with a suit to match In my dreams, my dreams, my dreams, my dreams My dreams Yeah, I wanna stomp on the moon Stomp on it Stomp on the moon, stomp on it, stomp on it Stomp on the moon, stomp on it Stomp on the moon, stomp on it, stomp on it Stomp on the moon, stomp on it Stomp on the moon Straight up into the sun I'm a spaceman, yeah, with a suit to match In my dreams, my dreams, my dreams, my dreams My dreams Hey, guys. Thank you for meeting me here. No, it's cool. You know. Moral support and all that. - You've got to convince them. - Yeah, well, I'll try my best. Don't even know where to go. Ah, you must be Gina. Yeah, I am. How did you know? Your small associates. - Small? - Sorry. I'm Valerie. I'll be presiding over the hearing. - Well, this is Jaden from the Garage. - Hi. - And Ethan. - Oh, hi. Yeah, I'm sorry. I've got a text. I'll be with you in five. He's small but he's very busy. Thank you so much for hearing our appeal. Well, as far as I'm concerned, there should be more places like this. - Of course, other pressures do apply. - Indeed they do. - Simon. - You look wonderful today, Valerie. When did I last see you? Oh, for the old people's home you were trying to turn into a... Carpet superstore, Your Excellency. Bet you got a nice new carpet out of that. Nice bit of white shag pile, was it? Shall we hear the case for the remand centre? Youth centre. - I'll have none of your games on this. - Games? Good luck, Gina. This is big. No, this is big. Lucy just texted me, man. She asked where I was and she wants to meet. She's just around the corner. - OK. - Well, how do I look, you know? - Normal. - That's good. - Ethan. - Hi, Lucy. How's it... Sorry. This is hilarious. Kissy-kissy time, big boy. We can't let money decide the fate of our children. Money doesn't care. Money doesn't know what is important. So why are we letting it make decisions about what's happening in our lives? What... What is that all about? When did that happen? I'm talking about libraries, Sure Start centres. I mean, closing them - totally insane. Because people need that kind of stuff. They... They... They just do. And if you close the Garage, if you shut the Garage, then... you're gonna be selling these kids short, too. Why should they pick up the tab for bankers' mistakes? Just putting it out there. I mean, they're kids, they're children, for God's sake. Communist. Look, they... They need a place where they can just be themselves. A place that is not their failing schools or their broken homes. A place where they can just have a bit of fun and be safe. A place where they can grow. And that's a precious thing. It's far more precious than a car park. Yes, it is. - Can't this wait until the show? - Let's get this out of the way now. I mean, there's no way some lame show is gonna save that dump. - You wait. Me and my mates... - Mates? You know that no-one actually likes you, right? Not your so-called mates. Not my girlfriend. Not even your own dad. Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! Can... Can I... Can I just say one more thing? The world that we have ended up living in, the one that we think's good enough for our kids, well, do you know what? It's not. And it's places like the Garage that are so important. - Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! - Oi! - Get off him! - What's happening? - Come here. - Ethan! Jaden! - Get off me. - He attacked some other kids. - This is a sad sight. - Ethan, what were you thinking? He said my dad doesn't care about me, but he does. It's very unfortunate timing. It was going so well in there. Not any more. Let's all go and vote, shall we? Time to choose between a lovely car park and a centre for violent children. I am so disappointed in you, Ethan. Well, I'm disappointed in you. I never should have got involved. - You dragged me into this, Jaden. - The whole thing was your idea. I don't know why I ever cared about you. And that stupid centre. - And that crew. I'm out! - What do I tell the others? I don't care. Not about you. Not about them. Not about anything. There's not really any point in me going back in there, is there? It's a real shame cos I think the show was gonna be really good. - Please, Gina. Couldn't we still do it? - It's cancelled. There isn't going to be a building for us to even have it in. Then he just left. So he doesn't want to be in the crew any more? - But he put this whole thing together. - This is a disaster. So it was a fight about Lucy? Look, I don't understand either. All he said was that he doesn't care any more - about any of us. And that it's over. Well, I have to say this is jolly disappointing. We were getting quite good as well. Mum went mental when I told her. Yeah, I don't know what all the fuss is about. You're a kid, right? Getting in scraps is what kids do. Your mother gets very easily upset. Next she'll be having a pop at ya for playing with your Lego. Don't worry. She'll get over it. Yeah, I know. I... I was just thinking... Well, you know, what if um... What? What if I lived here with you instead of with Mum? Or just half the time cos, you know... Yeah, um... Mm. Yeah... We could go out and like do stuff together. I dunno, son. I mean, don't get me wrong. I'd love you to. It's just that... You know, what with selling and stuff, I mean... l gotta go everywhere. You know. I've gotta swoop at a minute's notice and I can't have... Yeah, I just don't think it'll work, son. Anyway, these mates of yours... these so-called mates - or should I say "mugs" - you're right to drop 'em. There's two types of people in this world. There's people like me, and... So am I a mug? Cos I'm not you. Well, I mean... Well... yeah, you are. I mean, you're like me, I mean. Lone wolves just running together. You can't tie us down. Looking out for number one. You know what I mean? No, I don't. Well, first of all, we can't be lone wolves together or else we're not exactly "lone", are we? Look around you, Dad. Is this running free to you? It looks like a crappy bedsit to me. Is this better than being with your family or being with me - just picking me up from school or whatever, having a kick about, just being normal - not being a dad? I'm not a wolf, Dad. Just so you know, yeah. Neither are you. Oh, and I haven't played with Lego since I was eight, so you can stop getting it for me every birthday and every Christmas. Thanks. 28%! 28%! You get 25% for just spelling your name right, Jay. - I never really revised. - What were you doing all this time? Dancing. - Dancing? - It makes me happy, Dad. - Stop dreaming. - I can't! I've had enough of this. We're putting the house on the market and moving somewhere quiet. And until we move, you're grounded. - Hey, Tony. - Oh, hey. Three salads? No. Give me two Ultimate Maxi Burgers and an extra large milkshake. - I'm eating myself happy. - All right. Mum. Mum. I'm sorry. Have some ice cream. You know, I just don't want to turn out like Dad. You're not your dad, Ethan. And... l miss my friends. Well, go and sort it out, then. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's you. - Through here. - It's just you never let me in before. That's cos I used to care what you'd think. Hi, Mr Leigh. Your dad, is he OK? No. He's been like that ever since Mum left. Sorry. Didn't know. Why are you bothered? You don't care about any of us, anyway. No, I... I do care about you. I messed up. Yep. Want to unmess it up. I'm sorry. Say it again. - I'm very sorry. - Fine. I'm happy with that. - Me too. - It sounded genuine. I need one more. A longer one. I'm very sorry that I ruined the appeal with Gina and that now the Garage is going to be demolished. Guys, I still want to do the show cos you're my friends. Good. That's acceptable. - But what about Jaden? - I'll talk to him. And the fact that Gina's cancelled the show? She's given up, but we don't have to. If we let adults make our decisions, then we'll have one messed up world. But how are we supposed to do this? We're just a bunch of kids. Just a bunch of kids with a bunch of posters that we made and I stashed in my dad's lockup. Remember them? On Top Of The World Cos I'm on top of the world, 'ey I'm on top of the world, 'ey Waiting on this for a while now Paying my dues to the dirt I've been waiting to smile, 'ey Been holding it in for a while, 'ey Take you with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child And I know it's hard when you're falling down And it's a long way up when you hit the ground Get up now, get up Get up now And I know it's hard when you're falling down And it's a long way up when you hit the ground Get up now, get up Get up now Cos I'm on top of the world, 'ey I'm on top of the world, 'ey Waiting on this for a while now Paying my dues to the dirt I've been waiting to smile, 'ey Been holding it in for a while, 'ey Take you with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child I'm on top of the world Who's that? - Oh, my days. - What? You said I got to stop worrying about looking cool. Look I'm... I'm sorry for what I did. If I knew I'd ruin the show, I wouldn't have... Yeah, fine. Apology accepted. OK, cos the show's back on. Everyone's involved. Just need you, man. No. Why? It's a chance to show your parents what you're all about. I've let my parents down enough. Goodbye. See you, guys, bye. I'm sad it's closing. Oh, I know. Oh, me too. Don't make me cry. - See you, guys. - Bye. Thanks. - You're welcome. - Goodbye. ' BYE-bye. - Bye. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Bye, Gina. - Oh, I need a hug. Come here. Oh, you big silly love bug, you. Oh, ja mm... - That's it, then. - Yeah. That's it. - Nobody else left in there? - No. I checked. It's all empty. - Well, see you, Gina. - Yeah. Oh, well. May as well turn the lights off... for the last time. Bye, Garage. - Gosh, this is exciting. - Hurry up, Timothy. The van arrives in 20 minutes. Rebecca, check one, two. Come in. Over. Repeat. Come in. Over. I'm right behind you, lamoid. If school finds out we've borrowed this equipment, emptied their theatre of lights, it's normal school for the both of us, right? Sounds good. Over and out. Ladies, thank you. Can I just... Please. Thank you. - Ah... - Red alert! Whale has beached. - Repeat. Whale has beached. - Whales a bit harsh. Oh, hi, Gina. You're... You're nothing... You're nothing like a whale. You're more like a sleek porpoise. It's all right, then. Oh, and here he is, the man of the hour himself. Now, I distinctly remember telling you that this whole thing was cancelled. So, everybody, can you just stop what you're doing and leave now? I went behind your back but I knew you'd say no. Well, how very astute of you. You can't stop now. We've got a full house. Look, just look. Ethan! Is this one of your scams, like everything else that... you do? We've raised a ton of money. We might actually make it. The bulldozers are arriving at three. Well, that's 45 minutes, so... Where's Jaden? What have you done with Jaden? - He's being sensible. - I like sensible. Do you? Well, you also like the Garage and you like fun, crazy and stupid things. So please, Gina, let us be fun, crazy and stupid just one more time. 42 minutes. Go, go! Do it now. Whatever! What am I doing? Um... Well, I hadn't expected to be here doing this so... Gosh, there's an awful lot of you here, which is good. OK, everybody, so sit back and enjoy the show. Thank you. Kudiye Punjab Diye One, two, three, four! You don't have to say you love me And you don't have to say... We're on stage in 30 minutes. - Why you messing with your phone? - Gotta text Jaden and tell him... There's something coming up the road. It's quite big. So if our song begins to play Will it take you far away? Do you still remember our love? Oh, oh, oh Will you remember our love? Will you remember our love? Will you remember? Will you remember our love? Will you remember? Will you remember? Just wait there. We're going to have to hold our horses. It's ridiculous. Oi! What's going on? Why aren't the machines going? What are you doing? There are people inside. Women and children. - Some kind of talent show. - It should be rubble by now. I love talent shows. I'm gonna take this to the very top. Hmph. Touchy. - Jaden, we need you, man. - Look, we've got smart shirts. - Ethan got them printed. - Please come do the routine with us. - We love you, man. - Completely. I love you. You're like family. In fact, I love you more than my family. - I'm gonna do a rap. Jaden, Jaden... - No, cool it. - One, two, three. - We love you, Jaden! Oi, Bollywood dancers, we need you. More dancing. It's an emergency, so please come. Go, go, go. Go on. Tell the mayor it's Simon from the Seychelles. We played polo together. Hey, Jim, I'll ring you back. What's this? What? No. Get off! Jaden! Start engines. Come on. Crush them. Crush them. Crush them. Crush them! - Crush them! - Crush them, Simon? Crush... Yes, crush the... vanilla pods for the smoothies for the team. - Morale boosting. - Right. Because if I thought you were going to do something dangerous... Absolutely... Absolutely not. - Do you think we'll win? - No. - Positive, Tim. - I'm sorry. Just saying it as I see it. Are the All Stars ready to be all-bliterated? That doesn't really work, so whatever. Right.

Yeah, anyway, just say what you've got to say. Thank you. So... Guys we're nearly there. We can easily make it. Just need a few more quid. So please dig deep. Thank you very much.
