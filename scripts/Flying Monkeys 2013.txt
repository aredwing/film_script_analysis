Man, whatever. You should be happy you have a job during this recession. It sound like one got loose. You probably forgot to secure one of the cages, you idiot. Get back there. What you looking at me for? Lee? What the hell is going on back here? I swear to God, if you jump out at me, I'm gonna feed you to that tiger. Lee! Well, I haven't seen you in quite awhile. How you been? Hi. I thought you might've kicked the bucket. Nah, No such luck. Fill her up? At your prices? I don't think so. Oh. How about $20 worth? You gotta love high-school girls. We keep getting older, and they stay the same age. And as we go out into the world, let us commemorate this day as the day we began our lives in earnest. And as we venture out on our own, let none of us forget where we grew up. She is so hot. Mmm, smokin'. Where we spent our youth, working together in unison for one exceptional goal. Getting into your pants. Graduation. Our friendships, the trust will be the strength of our future. Our class may not be large, but we are a mighty team. He's still not here, is he? Okay. Come on, come on, come on. I can do this. Gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. I know he's coming. Smile. Our town may not be big and modern, but it is a special place. Just grab her on her ass, and make a hookup for tonight. Yeah, but I think you're forgetting one minor detail. Her dad's packing heat, man. He'd shoot me on sight. No risk, no reward. Shh. What? I thought you didn't give a damn what super bitch had to say. I don't. But we only graduate once. Oh. Oh, my God. Come on! Not a problem. I'll get there. It's just my daughter's graduation. Come on! May this town be a special meeting place for us all. Thank you for the best times ever. Okay. Okay. Oh, boy. Hello. Keep up the great work, my star athlete. Where would we be without you? All right. Terrific. Everybody's so proud of you. That was a really great speech, Chasity. Thanks. Hey, boo. Oh, hey, Daddy. You know I love you. Love you, too. Hey, Sheriff Flemings. Little something-something. Don't buy any beer with that. Better late than never. Typical. Come on. You knew he probably wouldn't make it on time. Yeah, and I won a scholarship to Harvard. Are you gonna be at the party later? Maybe. Uh... Just call me. I'll pick you up, okay? You better be. You better be. I'm gonna test you. Joan... I didn't make it, did I? Dad, the ceremony started at 1:00. Ah, God. I'm so sorry, Joan. If I had a dollar for every time you said that... You'd be rich. I know. More like retired. Yeah. The blueprints for the downtown lawsuit were due today. On the way here, there was a huge tractor, and... No, it's fine. I understand. Priorities. Don't worry about it. Oh, my God, Rudy. You're never gonna believe this. Just this crazy happened last night. I mean just craziness. I wouldn't go in there with... Hey, don't go in there. I'm warning you. Touch me again, I'm gonna put you in the ground. Who packed the shipment? He did. Well, he must be one stupid son of a bitch, huh? Rudy, listen. You don't understand. Shut up! One little monkey. That's all I got. Come here, little buddy. Come here, baby. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Where are the other animals? That's what I've been trying to tell you. That thing I saw last night must've ate them. Take this. Uh-uh. I thought I told you to shut up. Now take this. It's just a little monkey. Who do you think you're fooling? You think that I care that you killed your partner? Now I don't have to pay him. I didn't kill him! Look, I paid you for a plane full of animals. Now they all showed up in pieces. It's not gonna fly, Wang. Lee's dead. The animal's dead. Things are a lot more screwed up than you think. Look, you're gonna take it back to China. Or else I'm gonna come over to that garbage heap in Hong Kong that you call an apartment, and I'm gonna take you out! Do you understand me? Got it. You've got one week, Wang. One week. Hey, little guy. Did you run away from home? Bet someone's looking for you. Hey, there. Isn't that so cute? I know. You have to come to the party. I don't think I'm gonna go. You'd rather stay here and play with your animals? If it's that or watch the football team play beer pong, then yes. Whatever. I'll tell you what, though. I think Jason needs some attention. Just not that into it. You would seriously rather stay here and smell cat feces than lounge poolside, sipping on margaritas? Um, yes. Precisely. Just checking. I'm out. Okay. See you later. You suck. Hey, bro. Hi. You gonna bite me? I'm gonna kill you! Damn dirty monkey! Bite me again. Hey. Big party tonight. What's there to celebrate? Joan, come on. I said I was sorry. What else can I do? Nothing. Mom wouldn't have missed it. You know, when she died, I didn't think I was gonna lose both of you. Did you do this? Can I help you? Oh, hey. Uh, how you doing? Not bad. How about yourself? Uh, I'm good. Good. Can I help you find anything in particular? Got some interesting animals other stores don't. Yeah. Actually, I'm looking for something special for my daughter. Um, seems like you have a lot of birds. It's... Is it mostly birds here? How old is she? She's 18. Almost. Actually, shejust, uh, graduated from high school. Starts college in the fall. She wants to be a vet. So... I think today may be your lucky day. Ah. Wait right there. Oh, well... It'd be the first one in awhile. Oh. You're home early. Look, um... I've apologized about a million times at this point. So, I'm not gonna do that. I know that this doesn't fix everything. What is it? Joan... The whole idea of wrapping a present is that the person actually has to open it themselves to find out. You can't buy me off, Dad. Look, I just wanted to get you something special. It's a monkey. It's a monkey. I know. You went out and bought me a monkey. I bought you a monkey. What, you don't like it? I mean, it's not that. But it's an exotic animal. I mean, it's not easy to take care of. I know. I know. And I thought of that, but I thought, uh, you know, if a future veterinarian can't take care of a little monkey, who can, right? Hey, little guy. Oh, don't be scared. It's okay. Um, look. I know that it's not cool how many hours I've been hanging out at the office. But sometimes you just kind of wanna throw yourself into something else, you know? Wasn't just a soccer game or a dance recital. This was my high school graduation. It was so important to me. Look, it was important. And I blew it. It's okay. Well, shall we take him out? Hi, little guy. It's okay. Oh. Incredible, right? My gosh. Hey, what do you say we have a cookout tonight? I've got plans with Jason. Oh, okay. Shall I monkey-sit? Um, you know what? I can tell him another night. No, forget it. You don't have to do that. No, I... I wanna spend time with you. I mean... We have a monkey now. We do have a monkey. All right. Well, why don't you tell Jason to come over here, and we'll all have a cookout. Okay, sounds good. All right. Now, can't be in a cage anymore. Come here. Oh. Oh, my gosh. Hmm? Should I bring the cage? Um, no. I don't want him ever in the cage again. Okay. So what's his name? His name is Skippy. Skippy? Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't think you're gonna get any arguments from Skippy. Oh. Aw, I think he likes me. I think I likes you. Whoop! Whoa! Little dude! So what's your dad gonna do next time he misses a critical moment in your life? Buy you a tiger? Come on. Did he even say he was sorry? Um, like, 10 times. I mean, look what he got me. I didn't know buy-me-a-monkey sorry was an acceptable form of apology. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, he's trying. Gotta give him that. He's my dad, you know? I guess. You sure he doesn't have any diseases or anything? Yeah. I think he just is scared of you. He doesn't really like my dad either. Oh. And not a big fan of people. I think he just likes you. Maybe he just likes girls. Speaking of girls... Chill out, okay? Come on. Dinner's almost ready. Lame! This was supposed to be our night. It still is. We never have any time alone together. If it's not your dad, it's Sonya. If it's not Sonya, it's somebody else, or something else. Now you got a monkey. How am I gonna compete with that? It's always something with you. You act like spending time with my family is the worst thing in the world. What family? I'm sorry. Look, I'm on lack of sex, like ajunkie is on withdrawals. Okay? I'm going crazy. I don't like this. It's not fun. You should wanna spend time with me to spend time with me. Not because you wanna get in my pants. All right, whatever. Have fun with your old man and your stupid-ass monkey. Jason! Hey, thanks for dinner. And the monkey. Oh. You're welcome. Um, I'm gonna make him a bed in the guest room. Sounds good. Hey, Joan... If Jason can't see how awesome you are, he's probably not worth it. Okay. Thanks, Dad. Mmm-hmm. Hey, Skippy. Look what I got you. This is your new bed. No more cages, okay? Yeah, you like it? All right. Good night. Oh, Jason. You know, the thought of your dad coming back is kind of freaking me out. I told you. He's on duty all night. Well, what if he comes home early? He'll shoot you. Way to boost my confidence. It's not your confidence that I'm trying to boost. Oh, yeah. Mmm. Did you hear that? No. Nothing. Oh. Jason! I don't think that's such a good idea. Let me go in there. Let me see her. Sheriff, please. Jeff! Let me see my daughter! Jeff, please. Who the hell are you? Who we are doesn't matter. Why we're here does. If you work for the government or Greenpeace, some other crap like that, you best realize that every man in this camp is fully armed and ready to fire. You've lost men in the night. Mysteriously ripped to shreds. And what little was left of 'em you found the next day? Am I right? How did you know that? I also know that you recently caught a specific monkey, and you sold it. There are only two of 'em left in the world, and the other one is nearby. What's that got to do with us? It's what's been killing your men. Monkey couldn't do that to a man. That's not a monkey. It's called a Xigo. Something different. Something evil. They look like monkeys, yes. But at night, they change into something completely different. Demons. Demons? "Demons," he says. That's great. Our family has been hunting this demon for centuries. I get paid to deliver animals. Including those monkeys. That contract is canceled. We are prepared to hire you and your men to track for us. Or what? Or the next poacher they'll go for is you. You just bought yourself a tracking team. Hey, little guy. Let's get some breakfast. Ooh, did I leave the window open? Come, little guy. So you don't like nuts. You don't eat fruit. What do you eat? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. God, are you okay? What? What happened? Jason. What? And Chasity. What about Jason? You don't know. They're dead. They found them together in her house. What? How do you know this? The whole town knows. Everybody knows. No. No. I'm sorry. Sorry, honey. I need to call my dad. Good morning, Mr. Palma. Hey, Dorothy. What do you got? Hutchinson called. He wanted to know if you could push your 1:00 to 3:45. In the morning, he needs a revision on the blueprints you sent yesterday. Oh, and your daughter called. She said she tried to reach you on your cell. Uh, okay. Thank you. Baby? Dad. Sorry. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh, God. Come here. This stuff isn't supposed to happen. Not in Gale. Well, some bad stuff happens everywhere, baby. The Xigos were bred by a sorcerer to be soldiers. When killed, they come back to life. They duplicate. They become two new Xigos. When the sorcerer died, the surviving Xigos fled. How did you get into the demon-killing business? Centuries ago, the emperor commissioned my clan to hunt the surviving Xigos wherever they had fled. They must be killed by our blessed weapons. Otherwise, they will duplicate. I told you, no guns. Yeah, and I told you, we don't go anywhere without our guns. We had an agreement. I know. Bring the guns, but don't use 'em. Your guns are gonna make it worse. Much worse. And how are we supposed to defend ourselves? You found and tracked one of 'em. I paid you to track. Nothing more. Our weapons were blessed long ago. Only our weapons will stop the Xigo. Not create more. No guns, Joe. So why don't you just bless our guns? Ancient demons require ancient weapons that were blessed long ago and passed down through our family. Done and done. No! Now do you know why we didn't want you to sell the other monkey? He was their leader. There's another one left. We need to continue our hunt. How you holding up? I just want her back. I'm gonna find the son of a bitch. And when I do... I won't need no warrants or cuffs. Sheriff, don't you think this might be kind of early to start treating this like a murder? It looked like some kind of animal attack. Yeah. What kind of animal? There ain't no animals around here that could do something like that. This... This ain't Africa. You know how we always played the game, right, BB? I need you to be with me on this one. It may not be straight. Are you with me? Yeah. I always got your back, Sheriff. Come on. Let's get into bed. You're the only thing that's making me smile right now. All right. Good night. You sure you're feeling up to this? I mean I could take care of this if you want. Maybe you should go home and get some rest. No. Whoever killed my daughter isn't resting. Neither am I. Okay. Let's just get to the Tompkins farm and check it out. It's about damn time. Mmm, trust me. I'm not in the mood. I'd listen to him, Mr. Tompkins. What do you got? It's around here. You ain't gonna believe the mess. Got my best damn pig. You want this? What do you eat? Hey, baby. You hanging in there? Yeah, I'm trying. All right. Well, I gotta take off for a little bit. Will you call me, if you need me? Yeah. I will. All right. Um, where did you get Skippy from? Where'd I get... Uh, Rudy's. It's this, uh, pet store right by my office. Why? He just won't eat anything. So I don't know. I was gonna ask them what they were feeding him. Won't eat a banana? Tried. Wow. Monkeys don't eat bananas. That's weird. Can I actually, uh, have a banana? Yes. Thank you. All right. Okay. Bye. Good-bye. Are you ready to go? Yeah. I guess. Are you going on the monkey food diet? Pretty much what I do eat. But Skippy hates that stuff. He doesn't eat anything. I just hope he's not sick. So what did he eat where your dad got him? Who knows? My dad was so worried about making up for graduation, I don't think he even thought about it. Hey, count yourself lucky. Some kids just get cars and trips to Europe. You got a monkey that costs nothing to feed. Hey, can we stop by the pet shop on the way home? I'll ask them there. Yeah, cool with me. Maybe I can get one, too. Yes! Yes! Heard 'em squealing last night. Came out with Old Blue ready to let fly at a pack of coyotes. "Old Blue"? My shotgun. Oh. But by the time I got here, whatever ate my hog was long gone. Got my dog, too. Loved that little guy. Ripped him apart like the Devil himself had a craving for pooch and pork. But you wanna know the strange thing? No tracks. And I've done a fair share of tracking in my life. Whatever got my hog, ain't no coyote. Yeah, unless that coyote got himself a new pair of wings. I promise, Jim, we'll get to the bottom of this. Whoa, can I help you, ladies? Hey, um, my dad got a monkey from you. No returns. Don't even go there. Oh. I wasn't trying to return him. I was just wondering what you were feeding him. You know, I've tried nuts, grains, and fruit. But he won't eat anything. Cats and birds. That's all he ate when I had him. Are those double yellow heads? Um, those are endangered species. You shouldn't have them or be selling them. What are you, some sort of animal rights freak? I run a legitimate business here. Um, I mean, I was just... You were just leaving. Well, thanks for the info. Bye. Freak. I wanna thank you for helping us eliminate the Xigo. There is one more in America because of you. Who'd you sell the monkeys to? Some guys. Said they worked for a collector, all right? A name. We need to find them. You paid me to track for you. I did my job. We don't squeal on our clients. I'm gonna count to three. One... I thought honor meant something in your world. Two... Like he said, we don't know anything. So you're just gonna have to shoot. The name. Yeah. All right. All right. It's, uh... Tell me! Rudy Marcus. He trades in animals. All right? So how you doing? You hanging in there? Yeah. I'm fine. You know, if you need to talk to someone, you can come to me. You know that. Right? Do you ever think about her? Yeah. Yeah. Every minute of every day. Well, I guess we're boring him, huh? Skippy? Skippy? Skippy! Skippy! Skippy! I got you now, you sons of bitches. I knew they had wings. Got you, you son of a bitch! Gotcha! You like some of that? Oh, man! What... Ow! Okay. And get the milk... Whoa! Oh, hey there, little guy. Where the heck have you been, huh? Somebody is gonna be glad to see you. Oh, I got an idea. Let's surprise somebody, huh? Let me, uh, let me get this together. Where is the tray? Uh... Look what I found, huh? Skippy! Oh! I was so worried about you. Where'd you go, huh? I'm worried about you. You know, today being Jason's funeral and everything. I just want you to know, whatever you need, I'm there for you. Okay? Thank you. All right. Well, uh, breakfast is ready. I'll be downstairs whenever you two wannajoin me, okay? Okay. All right, bye-bye. Thanks, Dad. Where'd you go, little guy? Where did you go last night, huh? You can't run away like that, okay? You could get killed out there. Did you get hurt? It's Jim, all right. No tracks. Just like the pigs. Whatever did this swooped in, tore the old man up to smithereens. What we're dealing with here is the same thing that killed Chasity. Sheriff, this is getting way out of hand. We need to call in the Feds. Call 'em. But I'm not waiting for 'em. It'll take 'em two days to get here. Who knows what can happen in two days. Thanks for bringing me. Like I would let you drive today. And, you know, just being there for me. Of course. Did you want me to come by after Chasity's funeral? If you want. Do you think I'm a bitch for not going? What? No! Are you crazy? The only reason I'm going is because our parents are friends. Okay. I love you. Mmm. Thank you. Tell Skippy I said hi. I will. Sonya? Paul. Hey. Hey, Joan. Hey, what's up? I wanted to try and talk to you after the funeral. But you sort of took off before I could. I just, uh, thought I'd stop by. It's not a problem or anything, is it? No, it's fine. It's terrible what happened, you know. Jason. But, I mean, really, you think about it, this could happen to anybody. Could happen to me. Yeah. I still can't believe it. Listen, what Jason did... I... I'm really sorry. Like... Um, I'd rather not talk about it. But he knew how much I liked Chasity. And we talked about it at graduation. He helped me. He was on my side. He told me how to make her like me. Everything. But you know, after seeing what he did to the both of us, he didn't care about anyone's feelings except for his own. I don't really think that matters. Yeah. But you know what matters is, I would never, ever, ever cheat on you like that. It's been a pretty crazy day. And, um... I'm sorry... I'm just... All I'm trying to say is, if you ever need a shoulder to cry on, someone to talk to, a hand to hold, I can be that guy. Okay. Um... Thank you. Paul! You have a monkey? You little bastard! Stop! Stop! What is your problem? Please, can you just go? But, Joan, I... Go! Who is it? Who is it? What the... Who the... Oh! Yah! We're looking for a monkey that you recently flew to America. What? The monkey! Where is it? Who the hell are you guys? Interpol? Do we look like Interpol to you? Where's the monkey? What is it with everyone and this monkey? That monkey killed my partner. It ate the other animals in the cargo. I told him not to take it. You're going to take us to him. Man, screw her stupid-ass monkey. What's that? Hello? No. That little monkey. Uh, you laughing at me? Huh, is that it? You laughing at me, little man? That's cute. Well, guess what? You scratch my back, I'll shoot yours. That's what's up. I'll take you home, little man. Let's see you scratch me now, huh? Skippy? Skippy? Skippy? Skippy! I'm dying, and I'm uh... Dead or alive, monkey, you're going up on my wall. I don't know where you get them wings, but I do know it's dying time, my friend. Oh, damn. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, sweetheart. Yeah, I'll be home just soon as I make the, uh, cash deposit. Would you cut that out? You know I'm always careful. All right. Later. What? What the... 9-1-1. Skippy. Hey, I know. I know. I know it's late. Dad, he flew out of the window, so I followed him. And then there were more. He killed Mr. Sites. Wait, wait. Just... Will you slow down? Who killed Mr. Sites? Skippy! He grew these wings, and he became really big and just flew out of the window and took off. Honey, um, look. I... I can't understand you, okay? I'm on my way home. All right? Where are you? At the gas station. Okay. Well, go home. All right? Go home. Lock the door. I'm on my way. Okay? Please just hurry, Dad. I will. I will. Lock the doors. Sheriff. Yeah, Sheriff, it's James Palma. Um, my daughter, uh, she just called, and she's at Sites gas station. And then, she said... I didn't get all of it straight. She was very panicked, but she said that there was some sort of flying animal, and it had killed Old Man Sites. She said Old Man Sites is dead? Like I said, she wasn't making a lot of sense. Look, I need you to do me a favor. Can you get over to the house right now? I'm about 20 minutes away. Okay? Can you get over there? All right, James. I'll be there in five. Okay. Thank you. I'll meet you there. Okay? Baldridge, head over to the filling station. James Palmajust called, said his daughter witnessed the murder of Mr. Sites. Said, uh, some sort of flying animal, whatever, got him. Wait, Sites is dead? That's what you're gonna find out. I'm gonna swing over to James' place and get a statement from his daughter and meet you back over there. I don't think the suspect will still be there. But if he is, you know what to do. Copy that. Well, well, well. If it's not my old friend little Wang. Back so soon? I'm assuming you didn't fly halfway around the world to say hello. You got my animals? Not exactly. What is this, your entourage? The monkey, where is it? What are you, a cop? They're not cops. Then what the hell are you doing in my store? We need to know where the monkey is. It's right here. Apparently you don't understand English too well. So my friend, Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson, are gonna translate for you. I don't appreciate your presence in my store uninvited. In America, we call that trespassing. And I got every legal right to put you down where you stand. Screw you! It's the last time I'm asking. Where's the monkey? I sold it, all right? To who? Give me a name. Uh, uh, he wrote me a check. It's in my pocket. I haven't cashed it yet. You're coming with us. What the hell for? You got what you wanted. To put a face to the name. Get up! I feel like I'm going crazy, but that's what I saw. I mean, they weren't wearing a costume or anything like that? They were eating Mr. Sites! Uh, that don't make sense. I mean, are you sure? Yes! I'm 100% positive. That is what I saw. Sheriff, come in. Go ahead. No sign of Sites over here, but something big went down. Place is trashed. I'm on my way. You're welcome to come along if it makes you feel safer. No, it's fine. My dad's coming home soon. Looks like that's him. Sheriff, I'm so sorry about Chasity. Me, too, honey. It's not your fault. Hey, James. Hey. Watch over her. Thanks for coming by. I will. I'll give you guys a call. Let you know what's up. All right. Thanks for checking in. You look worried. Haven't seen you this worried before. You should be, too. I mean, everybody in this country owns a gun. And they love using them. There could be hundreds of them by now. Yeah. We have to kill the leader. What the hell you got? Lots of blood, but no bodies. No tracks? No. Just like Tompkins' place. Whoa! What the hell are those things? I have no idea what they are. But I do know they're the son-of-a-bitches that killed my Chasity! Think we killed 'em? Maybe. Go in the garage and see if they got a ladder, and we'll check it out. Whoa! Run! Run, BB! Run! BB! Pizza's here. Hey, sorry it took so long. This place was hard to find. That'll be $15. Okay. Thank you. Enjoy that pizza, sir. Mmm. I've called Sonya over 100 times, and she still isn't picking up. I can't get through to the Sheriff either. We have to go check on them. Well, hold on. Okay? I mean, we're not even sure they're in trouble, right? Okay, look. This is what I'm gonna do. I'll go by the gas station. I'll check on the Sheriff. Then on my way back here, I'll go by Sonya's, see if she's okay, see if she wants to come back here and be with us. Okay? No, I'm... I'm coming with you. Hey, Joan. Hey. I need you to stay here, all right? This is the safest place for you. I mean, if anything would happen... Okay? Okay Okay. But you have to call me, okay? I will. I promise. All right. Okay. All right, be safe. Oh! God! Your daughter was right. About what? The flying bat monkeys. They... They attacked, uh, Baldridge in the pasture. They came, and they ate him. Came after me. One jumped on my back, and then I got in the shed. And then they all flew away. So you saw what Joan was talking about. Like, a flying bat monkey? I'm saying I saw exactly what Joan described. You're lucky she's still alive. You know how to use one of these? What do you think? Just take the safety off, pull the trigger. I got a bad feeling this has something to do with Skippy. I gotta get back to the house. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, what do you mean, "Skippy"? Skippy. my daughter's pet monkey. Well, how long you had Skippy? I gave it to her the day after graduation. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come here. Let's go. It's quicker, safer, and I got tons of ammo. Get in! Open up! Open up! Open... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You okay? Sonya... Oh, my God, Sonya, are you okay? You don't have any crazy monkeys in here, do you? No, no, no. Why aren't you wearing any clothes? I was taking a shower. He was in there. He was in there looking at me. My God. It was horrible. Are you okay? Sonya, are you okay? I punched it in the face. Look, let's... Let's get you some clothes. Come on. Sheriff Flemings, please respond. We got a situation down at the sugar mill. Possible 459. I'm on my way. All right, we're gonna stop off at the sugar mill. And then we're gonna go check on Joan. Stay back. Let me take a look. Okay. I'll be right here. Just keep your eyes peeled. What? Do... Do you see something? The door's locked. He's probably around back. Let's... Let's go around back. Scotty, the pizza kid. They swarmed him, attacked him, and ate him. Pizza's warm. It just happened. Well, you know, maybe he... Maybe he's wounded, and he's just hiding someplace. Is that possible? Let's check on the guard. Hey, get yourgun up. You see anything flying, just point and pull the trigger. Hey. You can do this. Come on. Damn. Okay, I gotta get back to Joan. Okay? You gotta call for backup. Maybe the National Guard, okay? I really... I have to get back to my daughter, all right? Just hold on a sec. Okay, just... Run! Run! Oh! God! Run! Here. Point. Shoot. Ammo! Gale, Kansas, look at that. We don't need to go to the Palma house. I mean, I can hear their gunfire. They're everywhere. What's with these fools and their guns? Let's go. Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Gotta load the guns. What? We gotta load the guns! Here. Where's your gun? You just took it. It's in the car. Oh, they'll be back. Here you go. Drop your weapons! Drop 'em, now! What, are you protecting those things? No. We're protecting you. You're making things worse. Okay, Bruce Lee, feel free to make things better. Shooting them with your guns is only causing them to multiply. They only die when we kill them. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Me and James have been killing 'em. That's why they backed off. They're calm because they come in waves. Trust me. They will be back. You seriously don't realize how they are increasing in numbers every time you shoot them? What are those little toys? These are ancient weapons that were blessed long ago and passed down through our family. We wouldn't have to be here if it could happen any other way. A week ago, there were only two of the Xigos left on the planet. Now, because of all your shooting, look at what you have started! Hey! You son of a bitch! What'd you sell me? I didn't know. I thought it was just a monkey. Oh, you didn't know? I told him that monkey was bad news. Yeah, well, your dumb ass sold it to me. And you still owe me for the rest of 'em. Now's not the time! Look, I need to know everything you know about the monkey. I bought it from that guy right there at his pet store. Seemed like a great pet. It was very cute. They'd been bonding. Bonding? Yeah! If one's been in your home, you should be dead. And you haven't noticed anything strange about him? I mean, to me, it... It really seems like he loves her. They're killers. At night they transform and hunt. They don't bond. Your house is his nest now. No matter what he's like during the day, your daughter is in danger. We have to get to your daughter now. Let's get the hell out of here! What about my money? No guns! Oh, God! Get in the car, now! Drive! Get in and go! Hong! Hey! No! No! You know, one minute he wasn't there and I was taking a shower. And then, I opened my eyes, and there he was, staring at me, in the shower! I feel so violated. Joan! You're safe. Oh, God. Oh, God. My God, I was so worried about you. Oh. This is Yin. She's hunting Skippy. Do you have a picture of him? Of Skippy? Um, yeah. That's Nikko. Not Skippy. Who's Nikko? He would've been the last if I had gotten to him first. He leads the others now. How do we kill him? With a sanctioned weapon. All right, aside from using these blessed weapons of yours, what do we do? I mean, there's way too many out there to use just swords and arrows. He's the oldest of all the Xigo. We kill him, and the rest die with him. Okay, well, if he's this first-born whatever-you-call-it, why didn't he kill me? Because he likes you. Nobody's ever tried to befriend or be kind to them. They've always been treated as the monsters that they are. When he comes for her, we will be waiting outside. Are you suggesting that we go out there and leave Joan here as bait? Yes! No! He will come back for her. We have to. No way! Dad, I don't think he'll hurt me. He let me live at the gas station when he could've easily killed me. Here. Take the weapons. Joan... Find someplace safe to stay. I will. Hey, Joan... Find someplace safe, all right? It'll be dawn soon. So monkey bat will turn into Skippy when the sun comes up. Yes. It'll be easier to kill him that way. We just gotta wait, make sure he doesn't see us, and we'll be waiting for him. Get up. Hey! Hey! Monkey bat! Get off my porch! Skippy! Where have you been? Been looking all over for you. Can you take a couple of girls? Joan. Thank you. All right. I'm done. All right? I started this. It's time to end it. I'm going in there. No. Take Sonya and go someplace safe. Now. Joan, go! Let's go. Hey! You, monkey dude, your breath stinks. Get off him! Come on. No more monkey business. You Okay? Yeah. I think so. Didn't I tell you to go someplace safe? I saved your life twice. I think you should be thanking me. Mmm. Well, I guess... I guess we'll call it even, huh? Yeah, and don't be bringing home anymore pets. Deal.
