THE CHILDHOOD OF A LEADER More Movies & Series at Meanwhile, some shepherds were tending their flocks at night when suddenly an angel appears right before them. I bring good news. For today, in the city of David there is born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. I'm sorry. And this will be the sign for you, you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased. Who is that? Stop! No! It's alright. That's my son. Is he alright? Is he alright? That's my son! Is he alright? Yes, yes. My. Alright. You're alright. Thank you. Don't pedal your way back now. You wrote... that the human race is "Unimportant." Not at all. All I said is that it's happened before and will continue to happen again and again. Nothing like this has ever happened before, come on. They're still counting the dead. Please don't miss my point on purpose. This kind of brutality can be pursued back to Biblical times and what I said in my article was not that the rest of the human race is unimportant. I only stated that, above all it is the self that mustn't be betrayed. Well, let's look at the Bible then. I suppose one could say that Pontius Pilate did not betray his self. Well, that is certainly a banal illustration and one that most scholars would surely disagree with. But alright, the... the tragedy is not only that Pontius Pilate betrayed his self but that hundreds in the crowd before him did betray their selves. And that's what I wrote was the tragedy of war. Not that one man has the courage to be evil but that so many have not the courage to be good. Damn it. Alright, Charlie. Looks like you're four behind. Let's forfeit this awful game. For your sake. Another? Why not? I appreciate the company. How did that brain of yours get so big? The house isn't so bad. Lucky man, aren't you, boy? It's too grand for just the three of us... and it's a bit isolated. Well, it's not too far for me. I am in Paris less and less now if I don't have to be. Let's see what we have here. And it doesn't seem to be in such poor shape, does it? We took it off. My sister-in-law... they cleared out at the start of the war. The house has just been sitting here empty since they left. Came with a bad cook and a maid. I don't know, if we start to fix something I think, if it's worth it... who knows how long we'll be here? Yes, it might be a while. Doesn't help you being on the side of the... eternal optimist, does it? Well, there it is. Already, the French don't feel what we're proposing is a harsh enough response. Well, no European would regardless of what Wilson and the Americans are proposing. The war was fought on their soil. It's their future doctors and fathers lost, not yours. There it is. There it is. Clemenceau would prefer to have Germany... Well, the whole goddamned country dissolved. Well, with some patience, it'll be alright. How's the wife liking it out here? Took her a week to get over a bad case of boat sickness... but she likes it fine. Happy to be back in Europe, I'd say. I remember her telling Catherine and I that she lived in Strasbourg for some time, yes? Spent much of her childhood life there, in fact. She's got memories. Honestly, I think it's half the reason Secretary Lansing asked me to come along. She impressed him with her French at a... a dinner party, something or other and he seemed to assume that I too speak the language. Little did he know. She's already discovered the church adjacent. It'll keep her and my boy occupied. Now, these are rather peculiar? Brother-in-law's in textiles and it would seem he does well for himself. Textiles? You and I are in the wrong business, my friend. I've never met him. My wife says he's a Muslim. It was a bit of a scandal. The entire property is covered with these grim little statues if you hadn't noticed. There's more and more of them here every year. It's another reason to get out of the city. Mona! Mona! -You gave her the night off. -How was it? -Our son's not speaking to me. He's had an accident. -Everything alright? -He's fine. I'll come down in a moment. We've got company. Charles who brought me back from the city. Charles? Charles Marker? I thought you were in Germany. Not anymore, I'm here. Hello there. He's been acting out a bit. He had... dress rehearsal at church this evening. How's his French coming along? Well, it's certainly better than mine. Hey, you put blood on my dress. Why would you do that? Why would you want to hurt anyone? That was very embarrassing to do in front of Father Laydu and all our new friends at the church. They're not our friends. Maybe not yet, but they will be. Do you love them more than me? The people here in town? Yes. What do you mean? God gave me your father and you. Without him, there would be no you or me to take care of you. So, you love them more than me? No. Say your prayers before bed. Put your hands together. "Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.." Can I say them in my head? Yes. -Are you finished? -Amen. We have a friend downstairs. You must sleep. And tomorrow, you'll apologize to Father Laydu. You were going to leave without saying goodbye? No, of course not. I just didn't want to disturb you, my dear. You've come to join the expatriate? For a time being, yes. I thought you were in Germany. Well, initially it seemed like it was safer to be in the eye of the storm over there. But perhaps not the best place for me to be anymore. I don't work for that publication anymore but I keep myself busy with several others and even doing a bit of writing for myself every once in a while. Pleased to hear it. I recently got called out of hiding to cover the negotiations in Paris and voila, who do I find walking down the boulevard? Providing there is something to eventually celebrate at the end of all this, I suggest that we might throw a party here at the house. I know a number of very fine people who'd take any excuse to come out to the countryside. Always been a big support of your husband and he knows how I feel generally about statesmen and their politics. I do. Do you both some good to make some friends while you're out here. Well, sure, as soon as we are settled. Do you have plans for Christmas? He's already asked me and I said I'll think about it but I generally want to avoid the holidays and stay out of the way. Is everything alright upstairs? He's tired. What happened? He threw rocks at someone after the rehearsal. What? Why? I don't know. I was still inside waiting for him and a man from town ran after him and he ran straight into a tree. Is he alright? He's fine. I'm sure it's alright, he's only a little boy. He didn't actually hurt anyone, did he? -No, I don't think so. -Then it's alright. I'll talk to him tomorrow. I'd like to see him next time if he's having a better night. Of course. Well, I'm so... happy to to see a familiar face. Me too, me too. Well, I'll leave you both for bed. Goodbye. Be safe getting home at this hour. Such a vile language. Stop it. Hey, not too corked to make it back in one piece, are you? No, I'll be perfectly safe. Goodnight to you both. I'II, be in touch. You know his wife was killed traveling with him. That's why I didn't ask about her. I had a bad dream and I wet the bed. Look at your face. You wet your bed? I had a dream you weren't there. I wasn't where? Wherever I was. It's alright. I'm right here. Go change your clothes and I'll come up and change your bedding. He's really hurt. When did I give Mona tonight off? Yesterday afternoon. All the same. He'll want me to tuck him in. Hello! Get off the bed, darling. Come to see the snow before it melts. There we go. Did you miss me? What's happened to your little face? Good morning, sir. Stop dragging your feet. Hey-hey! Yes? Good morning. Good morning. We are here to see Father Laydu, please. Yes, enter. One of your parishioners has come to see you. Send her in. The little troublemaker! Good day. Good day, Father. How are you both? Very well, Father, and you? Very well, thank you. Please sit. And the rest of your family? You are all settling in? Yes, certainly. But we need to hire more help at the house. It's quite large. You should speak with Madame Guibert in the rectory. She might be of some help... Thank you, Father. I haven't seen your husband at mass. We only have him a few days out of the week. My husband works as Assistant Secretary to our Secretary of State. He's working now with everyone in Paris. We have a celebrity among us. Hardly. I've heard about your husband. He's English or American? American. He works on President Wilson's staff. Is that so? Well, he doesn't have much direct contact with the President. He works for Secretary Lansing... Please, sit down. Take a seat. The Americans are doing a very honorable thing in this country. We're quite happy to have them. We're happy to be here. Thank you, Father. I... I've brought my son with me to apologize for the incident last night at the rehearsal. Well, I'm afraid I missed all the commotion. You have not taught your own boy French? My husband has always preferred we don't speak it at home. He feels left out. But he's learning with a girl from town who speaks English. She's been working with him on his dialogue for the Nativity performance. Why not you? You speak very well for an American. No, I'm not American. That would be impressive! My father is German actually. He was a missionary. My sister and I learned several languages. I would like the same experience for him. I thought it better he learn from someone local, someone young. Well, you must excuse me. My English is rather poor, not even fit for a child. You'll speak for me? Of course. You look nervous. There's no need to be nervous here. You look nervous, there's no need to be. What happened to his face? The poor thing. He was running away last night and fell down. Last night you were throwing rocks at people after the performance. Is that right? You were throwing rocks at peop... Yes. You understand me when I speak? Sometimes. You were angry at someone? One of the boys in the play? Were you angry at someone? One of the other children of the play? Angry at your mother? Were you upset with me, he asks? Would you please answer me? Will you please answer me, young man? Father Laydu would like to help. All he's asking is for you to answer his questions. Do you understand his questions? Look at me. Do you understand his questions? Yes. Good. Would you still like to participate in the Christmas play? Yes. Would you like to make an apology to me? Are you going to say you're sorry to Father Laydu? I didn't do anything to him. Stop. Stop it. What did he say? He says he wasn't doing anything to you. He doesn't understand why I brought him here. Well, he's a smart boy... Maybe it would be best for him to address our parishioners directly at Sunday mass instead. It could give him some time to cool down. It's not always easy for a young person being in a new place. Yes, Father. -Leave me be. -Come back. Come back! Come back, please. Please! I'm sorry, mama. Thank you for coming so quickly. Thank you for the opportunity. How are you called? Edith or Edy. Edith is fine. And how old are you, dear? Twenty-four years, Madame. Do you have children? Yes, Madame, but... And the father? He hasn't yet been found. But we feel that he's still alive. Dear. She had an excellent referral from Madame Guibert in town. She's been very kind to me. She's taken a liking to my boy. How old is your boy? Twelve. Twelve? Sorry to interrupt. Hello, Adlaide. Not at all. Hello. Hello. -How are you? -Fine. And you? We had quite a week here. I think he'll be happy to see you. He's been upset with me lately. Why is that? He caused a bit of a stir at our church. Well, how was he in rehearsal? He did well. You did very well with him. He must be in his room, upstairs. Come with me. I thought you were playing in your room. Hello, Ada. Hello. Where do you want to work? Here's fine. But there's no desk. We won't need one for the moment. Well, I'll leave the both of you to it. In my room if you need me. Were you spying on us? No. You weren't listening to our conversation? -You didn't hear us? -I heard you. Shall we begin? Yes. What's that? Nose. Who's nose? My nose. And this? Ear. And this? My eye. Very good. And these? My eyelashes! Very good. I'm a girl and you're a... A boy. I am French and you are... Mother says we're citizens of the world. Do you know what this is, the word for this? It's easy. What is it then? A lion! Good... Very good. Do you want to take me on a walk? Where's your father today? I don't know. He's working in the city. Mother says we're lucky we were welcomed here with him. Other people from home didn't get to bring anyone. -Do you like it here? -I don't know. Do you prefer home? I might prefer home if I were you. It can be sad here sometimes. What do you say we practice your monologue for Wednesday? You know the word "to cut"? I don't know. Like, "to cut hair." Stop! -Did I tickle you? -No. Does your mother have you keep it long? No. You're a little boy. You should cut it off. You'd be very handsome. I bring good news. For today, in the city of David... It is because of all your constant devotion and prayer that we may go on to celebrate the end of such grotesque fighting and violence. Still, it is important to acknowledge that there is no true victory in this war or in any other. Even if we have lost so much that it is something impossible to quantify, God looking down upon us does not want you mourning only your losses, but the losses of our enemy, as well. It is only human a response that forgiveness may feel like surrender. I want to assure everyone that this feeling is a profoundly misleading one... Leaders from all over the world are presently gathering in our capital to discuss the potential for peace. -He's speaking about you. -Our Pope, Benedict XV, will certainly be requesting a role in the discussions. Needless to say, something bigger than a political and certainly an economic point of view must be represented in these discussions. And what more an appropriate day for us to celebrate the birth of our savior, as we too celebrate the re-birth of our nation. So, if you may... Let us pray. Amen... And now without further ado, I give you the children. I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you. I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you. I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Merry Christmas, Father. I'm sorry I threw rocks at you. I'm sorry I threw rocks at you. I'm not sure how long I can stand this. I'm sorry I threw rocks at you. What's she apologizing for? There was a little incident at our rehearsal last week. You seem like a nice little girl and I'm certain you are sorry. I'm not a girl! Merry Christmas. How are you, dear? wakened the lion... who placed... It's old French. Do you understand? -Yes. -Go on. His huge paw upon him. "What am I going to do with you?" asked he to the mouse. Sorry, I can't go on. Sure you can. I'll do it for you. Listen to my voice. Once when a lion was asleep a little mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon wakened the lion who placed his huge paw upon him. "What am I going to do with you?" asked he to the mouse. "Pardon O' King," cried the little mouse. "Forgive me this time, I'll never forget it." The lion was so tickled at the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go. Some time after the lion was caught in a trap and the hunters tied him to a tree to carry him on. Just then the little mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the lion was went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts. Can you see the moral here? Read that to me. Do you know what that means in English? It means, "Little friends may prove great friends." I think that should conclude our lesson for today. -What do you think? -Yes. I'm hungry. Well, then perhaps we should ask Edith to fix you some food. Shall I ask her on my way out for you? Yes. I'm very impressed with you, you know. Just think back to the first day we met. Quite an improvement. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. It's going to take time... but you will arrive at where you are headed. I will make sure of it. Do you have some fire? Hello there, chap. Dear. You must be famished. I plain forgot to ask for your treat. Your mother's in town, I believe. I didn't know you were home. Yes, home early. I returned from the city just a moment ago. Give your father a hug. No thank you, Edith. Thank you. "Give us grateful hearts, O Father, for all thy mercies "and make us mindful of the needs of others through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen." -Amen. -Amen. Not hungry, darling? You said he was famished earlier. I don't like it. Nevertheless, finish your food. But I don't like it. I don't like the food here. Neither much do I, chap, but I'll finish it all the same. We don't want to hurt Edith's feelings, do we? What is it you do in the city all day? You know what your father does. But what does he actually do? Well, it's much too complicated for you to understand in it's entirety, I'm afraid. But I help our president of the United States. I am a helper to the president of the United States of America, you see? Put that back in your mouth. Was Ada giving father French lessons today? What's that? Was Ada giving you a French lesson today? No. I was paying her. -But it's Monday. -She asked for an advance. That's right. She asked me yesterday. Do you know what he said to me? You will never believe it. "Mom... Does it always hurt like that when we love someone?" I know it's a bit silly but... Mona. Excuse me, Madame. He will sit with you until he finishes his meal. I don't care if it takes all night. Yes, Madame. I'm going to bed. May I take a bite? Horrible. Disgusting! Do not turn me out. We are offering Trentino and a few other small territories to Orlando. Will he be satisfied? I doubt it, but we should hope so. I will have to spend a few nights in the city. I trust you will be fine on your own. I'm not on my own. I have a full house. 7 multiplied by 9 makes? A little bit harder this time. 9 multiplied by 9? Very good. What are you doing? That's not right. Why... why would you do that? Who taught you that? My mother let's me do it all the time. That cannot be true. Please apologize. What did I do wrong? I think we should stop for today. I'd like to continue. No, not today. You have to apologize when you make someone uncomfortable. I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable. Hold your hand out. "THE NEW FEMININE HEALTH AND BEAUTY" "Where there is doubt, faith." "Where there is despair, hope." "Where there is darkness, light." "Where there is sadness, joy." "O divine master, grant that I may not "so much seek to be consoled as to console. "To be understood as to understand. "To be loved as to love. "For it is in giving that we receive. "It is pardoning that we are pardoned. And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen." Amen. Edith, please serve the first dish. Mama. Who are they? called this evening. Well, he just turned up here. You make certain that you take care of it, you understand me? I understand you. Of course. Excuse me. Pleasure to see you, my dear. Why are all these people here? It's a holiday. Orlando and his staff are leaving the conference. -What? -They are going back to Rome. It's chaos in the city. Secretary Lansing sent them home with me. We are gonna be conducting some meetings out here. -Why here? -It's private here. And Wilson doesn't know about this? Most major policy decisions he's making by himself. He doesn't consult us except to ask where some place falls on a goddamn map. It turns out, I am not the only one feeling that diplomacy has been pushed aside. Listen, it's nothing grave. We just need our own place where we can discuss more realistic ideas openly. It is just a discussion. Are there members of the cabinet here? Some might be coming, yes but please don't concern yourself with it and go upstairs. Do you realize what trouble you could all be in? Yes, I'm aware. It's only for a few days over the holiday. What should we do for lunch? I can't accommodate all these people. Where is Mona? Don't worry. Everything has been taken care of. Mona is taking care of everything now. She has plenty of help. It's still not enough to cover the region's losses. Shouldn't they feel lucky to be receiving any aid at all? It's quite far east. What if they take after the Bolsheviks? Isn't it dangerous to be throwing money after them? Is anyone here actually concerned about a communist revolution? The old Europe is quite strong, you know. No, we do not know. Please enlighten us. If it were so strong, then why are we here? Marxism seems to have taken a stronghold over this part of the world. Don't confuse Marxism with Bolshevism. The Russians have recently ignored some significant sections of Marx's texts. What he professed was that "Capitalism must come first." This brings on industrialization which in turn, will bring up a working class and that working class will inevitably rise up and an organic communism will take effect. As I see it, it was an attempt at fortune-telling and not a call to arms. You seem to know a fair lot about it. I am an economist, it is my job to know a fair lot about it. These debates are healthy. More importantly, they are necessary. We do appreciate your education and your position. I only ask that, as we move forward you appreciate ours as well. Thousands upon thousands further west would be most positively affected by reparations paid. So, I suggest we move on. There is significantly less damage there. Perhaps, but more citizens. In Paris, delegates are coming to ask for countries, colonies. They are coming to ask for votes for women. But away from all that noise what we must use this opportunity to discuss here quietly... is coal. Go. Although I have addressed this in many of my prior presentations... it does not seem to be evident to those presiding over the negotiations to what extent Germany is reliant on her coal. If we go after the Saar Basin it will leave Germans with no way back and nothing to build upon. We go after their coal. It will give them no chance to repay their debts or rebuild their nation. "Rebuild their nation?" What right do the enemy possibly have to rebuild while the rest of the continent is starving to death dying of influenza? Wilson preaches peace without vengeance or victory but it is just too emotionally removed, too intellectual. Where I am in-step with my president, however is that, one way or another we will force the world to be a better place. Mark my words. We can't acknowledge each community's system of belief. Have you found anything? This is the best map I could find. The decision of what places of faith are reconstructed and those which are not. We'll approach this in a secular manner. Excuse me. Yes? -Where is Ada? -This must be your daughter. My son. I apologize. I, I hardly got a look at him. Where were we now? May I acknowledge that there are multitudes of different faiths living within this region? Who is to say how one group should be favored over another... or what that economic division could do to their community? I'm willing to accept your point about faiths... Excuse me, gentlemen. Why aren't you dressed? Mona! Mona! Go to your room. Go to your room. What in the hell are you doing in here? The boy's running around naked. -I'm sorry, I don't... -I have people here! People I'm working with and he's running around naked! -The boy? -Yes. What's the word in French? Just go upstairs and tend to him. Go! -Yes. -Goddammit. Darling. It's me. Open the door, dear. What's going on? I don't know. He's had a quarrel with his father. Something about how he was dressed and now he won't come out. Leave him alone then. And stop making so much noise. I have a terrible migraine. Darling. It's only me. I have something for you. What are you doing in here, chicken? -Thank you. Should I put you to bed? No, thank you. Come back tomorrow morning. -Mona? -Yes. -Can you bring me something? -Yes, sir. Darling, we're leaving shortly. We've had some good news, perhaps. I'm not yet sure how long I need to be in the city... but I will get in touch when I can. Yes, dear. While I'm away, put the boy straight. I want him how he used to be. I'll see to it. You know what I think? I'm not feeling well. I want another child. What? I want another one. Maybe a little girl who is your spitting image. -I can't for my health. -You are perfectly healthy. Having him... it nearly killed me. S - stop. I'm bleeding. I could make you, you know. I'm sorry, I... I'm leaving. I've lost the notion. Goodbye. Madame? Tell him he won't be fed until he's dressed and out of his room. Yes, Madame. -Hello? -Yes. Darling, it's Ada. Can you open the door for me? We have our lesson today, remember? I'm busy. Come back in three days. Excuse me, do you have a moment? I went up to his room and he refused to see me. He told me to come back in three days. I'm not surprised. I'd say come back in three days then. No cause to negotiate. Yes, madame. He will be bored by then. If not, we'll starve him out of there. Adelaide? Yes? Do you know of any reason why he may be acting this way? Not that I know of, no. I only ask because of something he said several weeks ago. No. Anyway. Would you be so kind as to mail these letters for me? More Movies & Series at Thank you. That'll be all. We look forward to seeing you in three days. Is it good? Yes, thank you. Mona. What did I ask you? I'm sorry, Madame. He needed to have something. He's just a little boy. It's not your job to act as his mother. It's your job to carry out my instructions. Because I know what's best for my son. He's a big boy and he needs to learn how to behave. Yes, Madame. I'm very sorry. I'm afraid that will not suffice. You immediately went behind my back and deliberately went against my will. We care about you very much here, Mona. I'll be sorry to see you go. It won't happen again, Madame. I'm sorry, it's not up for discussion. Come with me. Why was she crying? I've got your attention now. Mona won't be with us anymore. No! Mona. Please, Madame. Please. Please, Madame. I don't have a family. I've been with this house for seventeen years. And you have been with us for just four months. I will devote every day of my waking life to destroying your family. You can show yourself out. Excuse me, Madame. I did not mean to bother you. You too. Out. Sorry? You'll make everyone here sick. Out. Out! Darling, it's me again. Darling, would you please open the door for me? Can you fetch my mother? Yes, of course. You have something to say to me? I would like to read this story for you. Been working very hard on it. I thought you might be ready to come outside and apologize to me. Once when a lion was asleep a little mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon wakened the lion who placed his huge paw upon him. "What am I going to do with you?" asked he to the mouse. "Pardon O' King," cried the little mouse. "Forgive me this time, I'll never forget it." The lion was so tickled at the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go.

"LITTLE FRIENDS MAY PROVE GREAT FRIENDS." That was very good, my love. Impressive. Yes, that... that was... That was great. Well done. It's not my doing. Shall I continue or are you satisfied? No, that was very good, dear. Well, then, I'd like to continue studying on my own. I won't be needing Ada anymore. Very well, then. Why don't you step out with me, dear? I just need a few minutes. What do you say we get some clothes on you and some food in your belly? Didn't you know that I speak four languages fluently? When I was your age I was still traveling the world with my family. I never once expected to find myself in New York... but there I was when I met my husband. I had no interest in being married. In fact, my aspirations were quite in line with yours, I think. But he wouldn't give up. He asked and he asked... and he never gave up. Do you wanna be a teacher, Ada? What? In life? Is this your aspiration? To teach? Yes, ma'am. You don't wanna get married have children of your own? No, ma'am. Good. This is for you. Wouldn't you like to make some friends? What do you do up there all by yourself? What do you do? Until I get someone here looking after you again... I'm afraid you'll have to bear my company. It's fine. Would you like to go outside and breathe some fresh air together? I need to study. I had a thought that you and I could be friends again. I'm going to my room. How about tomorrow? It's meant to rain through the week. Really? What makes you think that? What makes you think that? There he is, the man of the hour. Charles, what are you doing here? I just heard the news. I came to congratulate you. What news is that? The Germans have been summoned. A final treaty in the series is being drafted now. Well, that is wonderful news. I suppose we'll have to have that party. It means we can go home. Where's our son? In his room. In his room? Where's Mona? I let her go. You were right. She was making the situation worse. He's just a little boy. You cannot allow a child to run this household. Open this door. Open this door, I said. Answer me when I speak to you. I am sick and I am exhausted with your games. I am your father and you will show some respect to me. If you do not answer... if you do not open this door... I will give you... a lashing like you've never received. I will count to 3. 1, 1... 2... Come here! I've had enough of this! We... are going... We are going on a trip! We are going to Versailles! Now you... will put your clothes on for this trip! What's your name, dear? Julie, Madame. How far along are we? I'll have a look in the dining room, Madame. Thank you. That's not right. That's not what I asked for. Very good, very good. I'm excited to try this. The kitchen's on the left, down the stairs. Follow me. Eriksen, it was a complete delight to finally meet your better half. Pardon me. You must be very proud of your husband. Well, we are. And of his colleagues, of course. Really? I've... I wasn't sure. Laura is a reporter as well. Is that so? Well, not like Charles. I cover society events. Well, I do hope you enjoy the party. Hello there, little one. Hello there. Now, you've all grown up. Excuse me. What is it? We'll eat in a moment. What are you doing here? Come with me. You're on the other side with me, darling. -I prefer it here. -Up, up, up. Excuse me. I would gladly take his seat. That's very kind of you. Of course. Lucky you. Hello again, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us for this celebration tonight. And thank you, my dear for arranging such a lovely party. Tonight we celebrate the end of the Great War. I'm not much... up for a speech so I will spare you that. Instead, I'd like to call on my wife to guide us all in a short prayer. Darling. Why don't you lead us in a prayer, my love? He's much less terrified than I of public speaking. He was wonderful in a performance our church put on. No. Just a short prayer. I don't believe in praying anymore. Why would you say that? I don't believe in praying anymore. Take him upstairs. I don't believe in praying anymore! You stop it! I don't believe in praying anymore! I don't believe in praying anymore! I don't believe in praying anymore! I don't believe in praying anymore! I don't believe in praying anymore! -I don't believe in... -Get down and come with me. I don't believe in praying anymore! -I'm sorry. -I don't... -Prescott, get down! -No! Come here! Come here. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. Come here. Come here, come here. Come with me. -No! -Here! Get back. Stop! No! No, let me go! It's alright, it's alright. Mr. Secretary. Thank you, councilor. Mr. Advisor. Thank you, gentlemen. Mr. Deputy. Thank you, Mr. Advisor. Well, after all that I thought we might run out of ink. Next order of business? The security details surrounding his tour of the facilities. Mr. Advisor? Security has already checked on safety hazards. There's only one in and one out. How many workers present? 448 in total. That's dwindled. I concur. Very well then. Send in my secretary, please. Yes, sir. Next? As reflected in executive order 1-3-0-8-4 the coordination of the individual deployment plans have been executed. The further working out of mobilization preparations of state and people and of the mobilization of the top authorities is under way. Good. For this purpose I advise the secretary's office of the defense committee to compose a committee of specialists from all ministries. Should that be added to section G? Most definitely. Yes, sir? The councilor has requested that we please be well assured of secured access in and out of the facilities on the 14th of May. Yes, sir. I will arrange a second inspection. Would everyone like to attend? I think that would be best. Yes. -Will that be all, sir? -Yes, thank you. Sounds like they're arriving now. Shall we, gentlemen? Stop the car. I'll walk from here.
