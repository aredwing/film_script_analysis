"Your mother, Devana, was an extraordinary woman. " "It was a real lady of Darkness. But his power was not complete. " "For 300 years, your great uncle Vincent has tried to master it. " 300 years?! God, I hope to look like that when you are that age. "We have destroyed as your mother, if I had not sent her away. " "I've left all the power need to protect you. " "And I have entrusted to my faithful family." What is that familiar? Bob, you've never seen the old Roger Corman films? All witches have a pet, you can change almost anything. Where was I? Ah yes. "Not only do you want to protect, also the book containing the magic of your mother. " "Our enemy is dangerous. Protects the book, Elvira! " "First, when Vincent aprtalo the moon is under the shadow of the Earth. " "Remember, you carry the power to you. Your aunt, who loves you, Morgana. " What macabre! I knew it was different but not much. No wonder you put so Vinnie when not finding the book. Yes, you heard what your aunt said. Not have to fall into their hands. There is no way you have it now. I killing myself for a living as host of horror when, in fact, descend a celebrity metaphysics. If I find the right spell, I can make money to go to Vegas. I mean, really make money. I think you should not play again with that book. Here, Bob! "Riki Selzba Moula" ... Just what I need, much moula. - "Riki Selzba Moula" ... - Elvira, I do not ... ... "Pasera Floctum Kezrah Flome ".

You scared me to hell! - What is happening? - Say settling scores. See if they like. I assure you when you open the pot will repent. I have not tried this. Revenge is best that Christmas. I do not understand. What happened? It seems a kind of stew. This is wonderful! I have to get the recipe. Damn it! What ruined when supplanted the "folemgra" with red chili. Thanks for the drink.

I guess your profession, better attention. Come here, Bob, let me show how does a real woman! Sorry! Everyone saw it! I attacked in broad daylight abusing me! I?! Barely escaped alive. You'd end up with a mechanical bull. Do not get away with it, you sex maniac! I demand that the council dismiss this pervert. I did not even touch these sheep, so help me! Calvin smeared with jam all. I am innocent, I licked just a little. Silence! Do not you see? Have them in your hands. Is Elvira who is responsible of this. Sure, I should have known that was the bitch. We should throw the people mounted on a huge trunk! She might enjoy it a lot. There is a solution much more satisfying. We can make the arrest. Arrest, under what charges? It happens that there is a law going back to the Salem witch trials, specifically prohibiting and I quote: "Any citizen to practice the ancient arts of, witchcraft, demonology, alchemy or conjuration. " The charge, my fellow members council, is ... Witchcraft! - Let me out of here! - Stop screaming! I've seen "popular court". I have the right a call and an investigation. There are public phone in front. What is it? Not sure where you left the broom? Listen, paunchy, if I had a broom, would know exactly where I put it. This is great! I can hear Manny. "Hello, Vegas!
