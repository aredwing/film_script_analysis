AND THEY|HAVE HIM SITTING IN A CHAIR? IT'S A DUMMY.|THAT'S WHAT I THINK. WHY WOULD THEY HAVE A DUMMY|SITTING IN THE WINDOW? TO SCARE PEOPLE.|KEEPS THE ROBBERS AWAY. - IT WOULDN'T SCARE ANYBODY.|- NO?

I JUST WANNA DO A LITTLE BLOOD|TEST, SO YOU COME WITH ME. WE'LL GO SEE|NURSE SPALDING. HI, PIN.|HI, PIN. I'M SORRY YOU|DIDN'T WIN THE BET. MAYBE IF YOU JUST ASKED FATHER FOR|SOME CLOTHES, HE'D GIVE SOME TO YOU. IF I WORE CLOTHES, THEN NO ONE|COULD SEE INSIDE ME, AND I WOULDN'T BE ANY GOOD|FOR TEACHING ANYMORE. WELL, COULDN'T YOU TAKE|THEM OFF WHEN YOU HAD TO? I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF, AND IT WOULD|BE TOO MUCH EXTRA WORK FOR THE DOCTOR. WELL, I COULD COME BY|AND DO IT FOR YOU. YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL. ANYWAY, WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING|THIS CONVERSATION. YOU KNOW THE DOCTOR DOESN'T LIKE ME|TALKING TO ANYONE WHEN HE'S NOT HERE. WE WON'T TELL HIM. YOU GO OUT TO THE WAITING|ROOM NOW. PIN IS TIRED. BYE, PIN. I'M AFRAID THE BOY HAS|A FEW ROWS ON HIS LEFT LUNG. ARE YOU CONCERNED|ABOUT PNEUMONIA? IT'S CROSSED MY MIND. I'LL ORDER A CHEST X-RAY. LEON! LEON? LEON, COME DOWN HERE|THIS MINUTE! WHAT IS THIS? DO YOU THINK I HAVE NOTHING BETTER|TO DO WITH MY TIME THAN CLEAN UP... AFTER YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS?|I'LL CLEAN IT UP. NEVER MIND. IT'S THAT NEW FRIEND|OF YOURS. THE ALLISON BOY. HE LOOKS DIRTY|AND, UH, DISEASED. I DON'T WANT YOU BRINGING HIM|IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN. WHY DON'T YOU JUST|STERILIZE HIM AT THE DOOR? YOU MADE ME DO THAT, LEON. Y- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TALKED|TO ME THAT WAY, LEON! THINK FAST!|GEEZ, LEON. WAKE UP. WE'RE HAVING A GAME|AT SCHOOL. WANNA PLAY? HE CAN'T PLAY. HE'LL GET|ALL DIRTY. RIGHT, LEON? WHAT DO YOU SAY? WHAT A SPAZ.|LET'S GO TO SCHOOL. HELLO, PIN. I KNOW THE DOCTOR DOESN'T LIKE ME|TALKING TO YOU WHEN HE'S NOT HERE. COULDN'T I DO IT|JUST THIS ONCE? I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER FRIENDS|TO TALK TO EXCEPT YOU... AND URSULA- BUT SHE'S A GIRL,|SO IT'S NOT THE SAME. YOU GO HOME, MARY.|I'LL LOCK UP. I LEFT A MESS IN THE LAB.|DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. NOW, THOSE ARE|HEALTHY LUNGS. ONE IS FROM YOUR MOTHER AND ME,|AND ONE IS FROM PIN. - WHICH ONE'S FROM PIN?|- THE ONE WITH THE BLUE PAPER. LET'S SEE WHAT PIN|GOT YOU. THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF PRESENT|I'D EXPECT FROM PIN. GOSH! WOULD YOU|LOOK AT THIS? DO YOU THINK I'LL EVER|LOOK LIKE THIS? IF YOU GET CAUGHT|WITH THAT- I WON'T. DO YOU THINK MOTHER|LOOKS LIKE THIS? WHERE'D YOU GET THAT THING,|ANYWAY? MARCIA BATEMAN. SHE FOUND|IT IN HER BROTHER'S CLOSET. YOU MEAN SHE STOLE IT. SHE'LL PUT IT BACK. YOU KNOW MARCIA'S ALREADY|GROWING BREASTS? THOSE AREN'T BREASTS.|THAT'S FAT. MARCIA'S A PIG. SHE HAPPENS TO BE|MY FRIEND. YOUR FRIEND'S A PIG. YOU KNOW WHAT I WISH? I WISH PIN COULD COME HERE|AND LIVE WITH US. FATHER WOULDN'T LET HIM.|HE'S AN OFFICE DUMMY- DON'T YOU EVER|CALL HIM THAT! HE'S A STUPID DUMMY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING|IN THIS ROOM? WHAT IS THAT? YOU'RE BOTH REACHING AN AGE|WHERE CHANGES WILL OCCUR... IN YOUR ATTITUDE|TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE SEX. THE REASON IS TO PREPARE YOU|TO BE MOTHERS AND FATHERS. IF YOU DIDN'T BECOME MOTHERS AND|FATHERS THERE WOULDN'T BE BABIES, AND THE HUMAN RACE|WOULD DISAPPEAR. NATURE CAN'T ALLOW THAT.|SO SHE EQUIPS EACH OF US... WITH A BIOLOGICAL NEED TO JOIN|TOGETHER AND CREATE NEW LIFE. AND THAT IS WHY, JUST AS PEOPLE GET|THIRSTY FOR WATER, THEY GET THIRSTY FOR SEX. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS|BEFORE I CONTINUE? DOES EVERY SINGLE PERSON|HAVE A NEED? IF THEY'RE NORMAL, THEY DO.|ANY MORE QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT. LET'S BEGIN WITH|THE MALE SEXUAL APPARATUS. LEON, TAKE THE TOWEL|OFF MY LAP. LEON! DO IT! I'LL DO IT. HOW DID YOU LIKE|PIN'S LECTURE? OH, MARCIA BATEMAN ALREADY|TOLD ME ALL THAT STUFF. BUT NOT ABOUT THE NEED. DO YOU THINK MOTHER AND FATHER|EVER HAVE THE NEED? THEY MUST.|WE'RE HERE, AREN'T WE? IT'S SO HARD|TO PICTURE. I'LL BET YOU BEFORE THEY DO IT, MOTHER|WASHES HIS PENIS WITH SPIC & SPAN. DO YOU EVER HAVE|THE NEED, LEON? NO. I'M NOT OLD ENOUGH. I CAN'T WAIT|TO BE OLD ENOUGH. I THINK I'M REALLY|GONNA LIKE IT. COMIN' THROUGH. COOL IT. WHAT DO YOU NEED IT|NOW FOR? WHAT DO YOU NEED IT FOR|NOW? HOW YOU DOIN', LEON?|YOU CAN GET IT LATER. GUYS, WAIT FOR ME. ? I KNOW? ? I GOT A BETTER IDEA? ? I SHOULD'VE LISTENED|TO MY MOTHER? ? I SHOULD'VE KEPT|MY HEART AWAY? ? WELL, ARE YOU HAPPY? ? YES, I REALLY THINK SO? ?

HOW MANY GUYS|YOU BEEN SCREWIN'? HOW MANY? THE WHOLE|GODDAMN FOOTBALL TEAM? HOW MANY? I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, I DON'T WANT A SISTER|WHO'S A TRAMP. IF YOU EVER... DO IT AGAIN, YOU CAN|FORGET I'M YOUR BROTHER. HI.|HI. THIS CALCULUS|IS JUST KILLING ME. I THINK I'M PREGNANT. IT'S BEEN NEARLY TWO MONTHS|SINCE MY LAST PERIOD. YOU PROMISED ME YOU WOULDN'T|DO IT ANYMORE. I HAVEN'T. LEON, COUNT THE WEEKS. IT'S|FROM BEFORE THE PROMISE. WHAT AM I GONNA DO?|TELL FATHER. NO, I CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO|FIND OUT FOR SURE IF YOU'RE PREGNANT. I COULD GO TO|SOMEBODY ELSE. THERE'S ONLY SIX DOCTORS|IN THE WHOLE TOWN. YOU'RE 15 YEARS OLD. YOU THINK|THEY'RE NOT GONNA CALL YOUR FATHER? I CAN'T, LEON.|HE'D HATE ME. IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, HE'S GONNA|FIND OUT ANYWAY. YOU CAN'T HIDE IT. I'LL WAIT. I MEAN,|MAYBE I'LL GET IT. AND MAYBE YOU'LL WAIT TOO LONG AND|YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HAVE AN ABORTION. DO YOU WANT A BABY|AT YOUR AGE? LET'S TALK TO PIN. LEON. I'M COMING TO YOU WITH THE BIGGEST PROBLEM|IN MY WHOLE LIFE, AND YOU WANT ADVICE FROM- FROM WHAT?|WHAT? LEON, HE WON'T TALK TO US. YOU KNOW THAT HE WON'T TALK|TO US IF FATHER'S NOT THERE. THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S LOYAL. HE KNOWS FATHER DOESN'T LIKE US|TALKING TO HIM. WHY GO TO HIM|IF HE WON'T TALK? THIS IS DIFFERENT. A REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION HAS TO BE MADE|HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WON'T HELP US. LEAVE THE LIGHTS. HI, PIN. URSULA. HELLO, PIN. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL|ABOUT FATHER'S RULES, AND I ADMIRE YOU|FOR BEING SO LOYAL. BUT URSULA HAS A DECISION|TO MAKE. SHE THINKS SHE'S PREGNANT. I|THINK SHE SHOULD TELL THE DOCTOR. SHE'S AFRAID.|SHE WANTS TO WAIT. SHE'LL DO WHATEVER|YOU TELL HER TO DO, PIN. PLEASE.|PLEASE HELP HER. IT'S NO USE, LEON. LEON, LET'S GO HOME.|NO! I KNOW HE'LL HELP US. I'M GOING.|DON'T GO. LEON IS RIGHT. THE DOCTOR IS|A TRULY SCIENTIFIC MAN. I DON'T THINK MORALITY|WILL AFFECT HIS ATTITUDE. YOU MADE A MISTAKE|AND IT MUST BE RECTIFIED. PLEASE EXCUSE HER, PIN.|SHE'S REALLY UPSET. I UNDERSTAND. I REALLY|APPRECIATE YOUR ADVICE. ANYTIME. YOU AND I HAVE A|GREAT DEAL TO TALK ABOUT. I TOLD YOU HE'D HELP US. I KNEW IF IT WAS|REALLY IMPORTANT, THAT HE'D TALK TO US. WHEN DID YOU LEARN|HOW TO DO THAT? DO WHAT? GOD.|IT WAS INCREDIBLE. TO STAND THERE AND HAVE HIM|TELL ME HE WANTS TO TALK TO ME. TO ME. WHAT'S THE MATTER? NO EDUCATION LIKE|THE REAL THING. EH, PIN? AFTER ALL THE TIME YOU TOOK|EXPLAINING SEX TO THEM, GIVING THEM A BETTER START|THAN I HAD, WHERE DOES IT GET ME? SUNDAY IN THE OFFICE. OKAY, URSULA.|ON THE TABLE. AREN'T YOU GOING|TO OBSERVE, LEON? NO, SIR. MIGHT BE EDUCATIONAL. AND LEON, AS FAR AS|YOUR MOTHER'S CONCERNED, YOUR SISTER IS SIMPLY|HAVING MENSTRUAL PROBLEMS. THERE'S NO POINT|IN UPSETTING HER. ARE YOU FRIGHTENED? YES, SIR. GOOD. YOU WON'T WANT TO|GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. I TOLD YOU THREE MONTHS AGO TO|DO THOSE COLLEGE APPLICATIONS. I DON'T APPRECIATE DISOBEDIENCE.|WHY CAN'T I GO TO BUTLER COLLEGE? BECAUSE I WANT YOU|TO GET OUT OF THIS TOWN. I LIKE IT HERE.|THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD GO. IT'S STIFLING. COULDN'T I WAIT TILL|THE SPRING SEMESTER? NO. FRANK.|YES. IT'S GETTING LATE. THEY'RE|EXPECTING US AT 8:30. WHEN I GET BACK, I WANT THESE APPLICATIONS|FILLED OUT AND READY TO BE MAILED. THE MEDICAL HISTORIES.|DAMN IT! IF YOU GO BACK NOW|WE'LL BE LATE. I CAN'T GIVE THE SPEECH IF I DON'T|HAVE THE CASE HISTORIES WITH ME. I DON'T THINK THE DOCTOR|KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT THE COLLEGE. HE DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING|THAT'S SECOND-RATE. BUT I'LL MISS YOU.|I'LL MISS YOU. BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK|ABOUT YOUR FUTURE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO|WITH MY FUTURE. WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU NEED TO GET|THE BEST EDUCATION YOU CAN GET. THAT'S WHAT FATHER SAYS.|HAS HE BEEN TALKING TO YOU? LEON- GO HOME. NOW! WAIT. YOUR MOTHER IS SITTING OUTSIDE|IN THE CAR. I DON'T WANT HER|TO SEE YOU LEAVE. HELP ME WITH THE DOOR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I DECIDED TO TAKE|PIN. I CAN USE HIM FOR A VISUAL AID. I HATE THAT THING BEING IN THE|CAR. IT GIVES ME THE CREEPS. DON'T WORRY. IT'LL BE A ONE-WAY TRIP.|I'M LEAVING HIM WITH THE SOCIETY. HE'LL MAKE A GOOD|TEACHING AID. - SLOW DOWN!|- WE'RE LATE. FRANK! WOULD YOU PLEASE|SLOW DOWN! OH, GOD!|OH! IT WAS THE CURVE.|JUST RELAX. I AM FEELING NAUSEOUS.|CAN'T YOU LAY IT DOWN? I'M DRIVING! YOU LIE|IT DOWN. CAN'T TOUCH IT. THEN JUST RELAX.|WE'LL BE THERE SOON. DAMN IT.|WE'RE NOT GONNA BE IN TIME. I WOULD PREFER|TO GET THERE LATE. WATCH OUT! OH! COMING THROUGH, PLEASE.|CLEAR THIS AREA HERE. PIN. LEON. OH, IT'S SUCH A SHAME. VERY SORRY. IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN A WEEK TO|SUBLET MY APARTMENT AND GET BACK HERE. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,|AUNT DOROTHY. WE'LL BE FINE. FATHER LEFT US A BIG ESTATE. I'M|NOT TALKING ABOUT MONEY, LEON. I'M NOT GONNA LET MY SISTER'S LITTLE|GIRL GROW UP WITHOUT A WOMAN AROUND. BUT URSULA-|DON'T ARGUE, LEON. SHE'S A MINOR,|AND SHE NEEDS ADULT SUPERVISION. BUT YOU HAVE A WHOLE LIFE|OF YOUR OWN BACK IN THE CITY. OH.|DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. IT'D BE GOOD FOR MY HEART|TO MOVE OUT HERE. DON'T FEEL AS IF|I'M BEING INCONVENIENCED. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THIS HOUSE. NOW, YOU TWO BE GOOD.|SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. BYE. WHAT A MESS. WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT|MOTHER'S DOING RIGHT NOW? SHE'S VACUUMING HEAVEN. AND I BET SHE'S TELLING GOD|TO TAKE OFF HIS SHOES. YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE? THIS PLASTIC. AND TOMORROW WE CAN HAVE CHICKEN.|AND THEN THERE'S RIBS AND BURGERS. WE NEVER HAVE TO COOK AGAIN. I ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN|HOW TO COOK, BUT SHE SAID I WOULD MAKE|TOO MUCH OF A MESS. WHAT? CAN WE CLEAN UP|BEFORE WE GO TO BED? SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? LEON! YOU CAN'T DO THIS! I THINK WE SHOULD|DISCUSS THIS OUTSIDE. FATHER DID NOT WANT HIM|IN THE HOUSE! OUTSIDE! I DON'T HAVE TO BE REMINDED|ABOUT FATHER'S ATTITUDE, AND I THINK IT'S RUDE OF YOU|TO BRING IT UP IN FRONT OF PIN. FATHER'S DEAD. WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN|TO PIN IF I DIDN'T BRING HIM HOME? HE'D PROBABLY BE LOCKED|IN SOME CLOSET OR KILLED. HE'S FAMILY- MORE THAN ANY STUPID AUNT DOROTHY|- AND I WANT HIM HERE. AUNT DOROTHY'S GONNA HAVE A FIT|WHEN SHE SEES HIM. SHE WON'T SEE HIM. I'LL PUT HIM IN THE ATTIC.|I'LL KEEP THE DOOR LOCKED. BESIDES, I DON'T THINK AUNT DOROTHY WILL|BE STAYING WITH US FOR VERY LONG. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? DO YOU WANT HER HERE? PEOPLE DON'T STAY IN A PLACE|THEY'RE NOT WANTED. IT MIGHT TAKE HER A LITTLE WHILE TO FEEL|THE VIBRATIONS, BUT I THINK SHE WILL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.|HAVEN'T I ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF YOU? YES. AND I ALWAYS WILL. GOOD NIGHT. SORRY, PIN. THAT'S ALL|RIGHT, LEON. I UNDERSTAND. LEON, WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL|THE COVERS ON THE FURNITURE? I TOOK THEM OFF. I HOPE|YOU DIDN'T THROW THEM AWAY. I STORED THEM. GOOD. THIS|IS VERY EXPENSIVE FURNITURE. WE DON'T WANT|IT RUINED. YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.|SO MUCH LIKE HER SISTER. THEY WERE MADE FROM THE SAME MOLD. SHE'LL|HAVE THIS HOUSE SHIPSHAPE IN NO TIME. FIRST THE PLASTIC COVERS WILL GO BACK.|THEN THE FIREPLACE WILL BE SEALED SHUT. IT WILL BE JUST LIKE OLD TIMES. I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND|ALL THE PLASTIC COVERS. DO YOU KNOW|WHERE THEY ARE? THEY'RE IN THE ATTIC. OH, I LOOKED UP THERE,|BUT THE DOOR WAS LOCKED. SOMEBODY LOST THE KEY. OH, WELL. I'LL JUST CALL|THE LOCKSMITH IN THE MORNING. DON'T YOU LIKE YOUR|DINNER, LEON? MM. YEAH. I'M SURE IT'S NOT AS GOOD|AS YOUR MOTHER USED TO MAKE. IT'S JUST AS GOOD.|WHY, THANK YOU. WELL, DID ANYTHING|EXCITING HAPPEN TODAY? I GOT A JOB|AT THE LIBRARY. I APPLIED LAST WEEK,|AND THEY CALLED TODAY. IT'S JUST TEMPORARY FOR NOW, BUT IF I WANT|I CAN HAVE IT FULL-TIME WHEN I GRADUATE. AH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. YOU NEVER TOLD ME|ABOUT THAT. IT JUST HAPPENED. WHAT DO YOU NEED A JOB FOR?|YOU HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY. WELL, A GOOD JOB IS WORTH|MORE THAN MONEY, LEON. IT'S GOOD|FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH|YOUR MENTAL HEALTH, URSULA? I JUST WANNA DO IT.|OKAY? ARE YOU FINISHED?|JUST WITH DINNER. SHE IS TAKING OVER|THE HOUSE. SHE'S CHANGING URSULA. SHE NEVER KEPT THINGS|FROM YOU BEFORE. YOU NEVER HAD SECRETS|FROM EACH OTHER. YOU'D BETTER|DO SOMETHING, LEON. NOW. HI. PIN'S SUGGESTION. HE|FEELS I WAS RUDE TO YOU. YOU WERE RUDE|TO AUNT DOROTHY.

"CLOSER SHE CAME TO HIM, MOVING,|IT SEEMED, IN SILENT MOTION. "HIS HEART BEAT STEADILY|WITHIN THE CAVERNS OF HIS BOSOM, "DRIVING HOT BLOOD THICK DOWN,|DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS OF HIS LOINS. "HE LUNGED FROM THE DEEPEST|DARKEST PASSIONS IN US ALL. "SHE TURNED WITHOUT A SOUND|AND FACED HIM. "HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY. "IT WAS AS IF A KNIFE HAD|PERFORMED AN INSTANT CASTRATION.

YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A|TENDENCY TOWARD BLIND OPTIMISM. I'D LOVE TO SIT AND ARGUE, PIN. BUT I'D LIKE|TO GET DOWNSTAIRS, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. HE NEEDS PSYCHIATRIC HELP.|I CAN'T DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO. HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT|THAT THING IS A PERSON. DOESN'T HE REALIZE|HE'S USING VENTRILOQUISM? HE'S NOT HURTING ANYONE. HE CAN JUST GO ON LIVING HERE|AND WRITING HIS POETRY. HIS POETRY IS SICK. HE'S|TALKING ABOUT RAPING HIS SISTER. IT'S JUST A POEM.|IS IT? WOULD YOU LIKE|ANOTHER DRINK, STAN? THANK YOU. LEON, WOULD YOU|LIKE ANOTHER DRINK? I'M NOT FEELING VERY WELL. IF YOU|TWO WOULD EXCUSE ME, I'LL GO TO BED. GOOD NIGHT. DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW|WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? I'VE READ EVERY PSYCHIATRIC|TEXT IN THE LIBRARY. LEON IS A PARANOID|SCHIZOPHRENIC.

HE WAS IN A HURRY,|SO I DIDN'T ASK QUESTIONS. WHY DIDN'T HE CALL ME|AT THE LIBRARY? PERHAPS YOU HAD ALREADY LEFT. DID HE SAY HE'D CALL BACK?
