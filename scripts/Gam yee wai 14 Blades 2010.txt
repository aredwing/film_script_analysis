Must draw Tuo Tuo away Divert their attention and the Seal City of Sky Wolves is famous for its labyrinthian passage I know a shortcut that will enable us to pass them Brothers we must hurry CITY OF SKY WOLVES Stop Xuan Wu You deliver the Seal I will take care of Qinglong Let's go Check it out HERE LIES THE BODY OF XUAN WU Have the fire shooters dimount and chase Up Go after them Yes Let us split up here Go Yes Fire Cease fire Retreat Charge Charge The Seal is here I cannot turn back now Kill me Brother Qinglong, go to Qao Hua quickly We will handle this here Qinglong fooled you into dying for him Here comes the Sky Eagles Judge Judge I said scram Scram Tell Qinglong for me If you see me upon this sandy horizon again Do not be overyjoyed It is she that you see After going through here You can pass through the border Aren't you coming with me The road for a Jinyiwei is short Mine has come to its end today You told me We would deliver the Seal together And then you would leave with me I promise you From now on, if you need me You only need to ring the bell on your wrist And I will be there for you Let me tell you a secret That day After I saw my fiance I came back for you I wanted to tell you I have declined the proposal Whatever you tell me to do I will do it No matter if you are lying to me I will wait for you After I take care of Tuo Tuo, I will come immediately Wait for me Before I complete my task Whomever stands in my way No matter friend or foe Will have to go down first In the end, I safely delivered the Seal to General of the West Just like I promised Qinglong The conspiracy was found out Prince Qing killed himself before execution It is rumored that Prince Qing has never cried in his life But upon hearing the death of Tuo Tuo He shed a tear The people were most thrilled that the Emperor held court again Sir Zhao was released Brother Huang, this way Yes, boss Prepare food fast Must continue after lunch Hurry, hurry Before father passed away he said that Justice Escorts must remain open For all that is just and fair in the world He also let me know a secret That his wine is not for bruises and wounds But for him to remember The sweet memories of the past When I drink this wine I am reminded of a friend I met in the desert I feel very fortunate to have met him Because I am witness that the Judge has turned for the good Of course, I will also think of him And the roads we have traveled together I may not know the ways of the world He once told me that I only need to ring a bell on my wrist And he will appear Whatever he tells me to do, I will do it No matter if he lying to me or not It is fortunate to have hope
