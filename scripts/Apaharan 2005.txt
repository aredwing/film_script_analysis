The Government has still not replied to our allegations. Through the press I've exposed... ...the list of fake co-operative societies. Shastri-ji, what will your next step? I have decided to give Chief Minister Brijnath Mishra... ...and Co-operatives Minister Daya Shankar a week's notice. And if that fails then Satyagraha. It's futile to send the government one notice after another. Here my child's breakfast is not ready. Will this daily lecturing fill anyone's stomach? Stop racing around. First eat the puri. - No! I'll get late Buchhi kaka. Have at least 2, dear. How will you carry this load with an empty stomach? I'm late! Kashi is waiting outside. Listen! Oh God! With the policies, this coalition government is adopting... ...there is more likelihood of destruction than development. Here's your late fine. Drop me at Kalyani chowk. I've to go to City Medical. What's the point of wandering on foot? I'll drop you to City Medical. This Vishnu Sharma is acting like we've come to loot his shop. Forget it. You go. See you in the evening. Hello, Mr. Sharma. - Greetings. You again? How many times I've told you. That indigenous medicine doesn't sell. What are you saying, Mr. Sharma? These Ayurvedic medicines have become a rage in London and America. The company has come out with new tablets... ...for hypertension and blood pressure. Oh! In that case give me a pill for hypertension. The very sight of you stresses me out! Come on, Mr. Sharma. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Fine. Okay. Give me these medicines except the two on top. El-thro-cin... five hundred. Two strips. So Mr. Sharma, what should I book? I told you. I don't want anything. - Okay, I'll come tomorrow. But sir, at least clear the old payment. What payment? Can't you see all your stocks are still lying on the shelves! Please! The company is pressurizing me! They're giving me reminder after reminder. So take away all your stock from here! It's just eating up the space for nothing. Lallan. Yes, sir. Remove the Vindhyachal stock. Sharma-ji, there's no need for this! Let it be, friend. I'll come back next week. Till then please let me put up this publicity. Which company do you work for? - Vindhyachal Ayurvedic. He's working for part time. We're trying at the Ranchi Medical College for Megha. She will do her post-graduation there. Even Ajay has given the State Police Service competitive exam. He has done well in the interview and the physical. The merit list will be out any day now. Done, Mr. Sharma? Help! Hey! Run! Hey! Ajay! Ajay! Megha! Ajay! BRE-7931. That's the number. - Have you gone mad? They've gone that way! - They were firing! Yes, sir... I'm at the crime scene. I'm coming. What's the situation like? There is tension. But things are under control now. Find out where they've gone. - Sir! Alert everyone at the police station. - Right, sir. Sir, I tried to stop them. They've gone towards Phulpur Chowki! Who are you? My name is Ajay Shastri. Professor Rahguvansh Shastri is his father. Sir, his uncle was also in the force. Inspector Balwant Shastri. He was a very bold officer. He was martyred at the Lalsingh gang encounter. This is the total failure of law and order, brothers. In broad daylight, a trader is kidnapped from the market! Down with the police department! Calm down. This is not the time for a strike. Down with SP Khan! Move back! Down with SP Khan! SP Mr. Anwar Khan, what is happening here? How long will this continue? Please, we'll talk to you in a moment. Taken any statements? - Sir... Who made the phone call? - I did sir, from the City Medical stores. Sir, there were 4 people. It was a red Maruti van. B.R. E - 7931. Did you see them? I caught a glimpse of the man sitting in the front seat. Mr. SP Khan, how many kidnappings... ...have you taken the onus for? Mr. Soorajmal, you're making an unfair allegation. And what you all are doing is fair? The SP before you, IPS Balbir Singh controlled everything brilliantly. He even had MLA Tabrez Alam's gang cornered. But as soon as you've come! 13 cases in 3 months! This government cannot protect anyone. Shut down the market till Seth Nandlal is not released. Total strike! - Yes. Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Get them away. Seth Nandlal, who was kidnapped today, was a textile merchant. The last 3 months he was receiving threat calls. But the police did not provide any security. Due to the increasing incidents of kidnapping... ...the people here are quite enraged. Akash Ranjan, Kalyani Chowk, Salampur, Aaj Tak. This will not do! We will not allow this! Meaningless dramas, rascals. Hey! The poor, underprivileged, minorities... ...all have become second class citizens. Since the new government has come to power. We've been targeted. The entire welfare fund for our district is held up. For education, employment, roads, electricity, nothing is done. There is outrage all over! Sir, Seth Nandlal is kidnapped. - Brothers, if this continues... ...then before long this government... That's why you've started this industry. Brothers, Seth Nandlal have just been kidnapped. Everyone knows who is behind this. Hey! So you mean to say even this is Tabrez Alam's doing? Hey, quiet! Quiet! Then why don't you arrest me? Tell me. Long live Tabrez Alam! This government is incompetent! Dismiss it! Kidnappings must stop! Or this government must fall! This government is incompetent! This government is incompetent! Dismiss it! Don't forget Mr. Chief Minister. You have brought the chair that you're sitting on with our donations! Brothers, why are you opening the old chapter again? I've given the orders. Our government will not spare any of the criminals. We don't want assurances. We want Nandlal back. Till you don't rescue Nandlal, the total market... ...in Salampur will remain close. We've had enough! Just hear me out! Look at this. We've put the CID Special branch... ...the police force, all on emergency duty. Very soon our brother Nandlal will be brought back safely. Mr. Home Minister, when the whole world knows that... ...Tabrez Alam is responsible then why don't you arrest his people? And immediately transfer SP Khan from Salampur. Apart from kidnapping there are several... ...other crimes happing under your nose. Who all will you transfer? Look, we've put forward our demands. Nandlal has to be released within 48 hours. That's all. Has Ajay eaten? He just had a glass of milk. How badly he is hurt! Did he take any medicine? I gave him a massage too. - Don't wake him up early. Let him sleep. Deep down you love him so much. Why don't you do something for him? You won't understand. He'll succeed on his own merit. Now he comes! Rascal! Hey, get up! Look at the time Murli-bhai. We waited all the night. We're bloody well fed up. Traffic jam, Salim. - You're too much. Hold him tight. Sorry, I've ruined your whole night. Shall I get you tea? No. I'm fine. You'll obviously be fine! Get ready. You've to come with me. Where? Your wife's house. How should I know? I'm just a middleman. I take deliveries and drop them off wherever the boss orders. Let's get going now. Pull him up. Get him out properly. We've accomplished such a major job. It took 8 men... bullets were fired. And you're giving peanuts. Look at these accounts. You had presented a budget of Rs. 75,000/- and we've spend... Tea, snacks, lunch, dinner Rs. 12,500/- Bus, train, car, travel, Rs. 3,250. Cost of stealing 2 Maruti vans Rs. 37,000/-. Pistols, ammunitions of Rs. 29,500/-. Pocket money of 8 men, 500 each daily, Rs. 32,000/- Total Rs. 1,14,150/-. You've already got the cash. Now this is bonus. How can we manage with this? We are 8 of us. Okay, return the advance and all expenses and take your cash back. Whining unnecessarily. Then take your bonus back! Forget it. Let's get out of here. We'll make our claims later. Come, let's go. Are you getting nervous, sir? Salim, just give him an injection and put him in the backseat. Otherwise he'll disturb us all the way! No, no. Bhai, its Murli. Yes, what? Good morning, boss. The delivery is made. Okay, now do him some hospitality. Keep him in Pannalal's factory. Natua is there. I'll send him but how long will this charity last? You've not paid me for the last 2 jobs. If this goes on, I'll be on the streets. Stop this nonsense. I'm in trouble right now. What can trouble you with the police in your pocket? And Tabrez Alam's power on top. Be patient till the collection. I'll clear everything. The total is more than 20 lakhs. Now don't be a glutton! I told you it will be done! Since childhood I fancied a police job. I've tried for the IPS exams thrice but without success. His father never let him take coaching. I've fared well in the State Police exam too. But no news yet. This is my last chance. Or I'll cross the age requirement. I am indebted to your uncle. I'll do something for you. Hello. Pandey here. Give the phone to Tabrez Alam. Yes. Mr. Pandey on the line. Hello, Home Minister. What made you remember me? What's happening to that Hajipur trader Nandlal? Come on. You're the Home Minister. The state police are in your hands. You should know better. Stop this drama, Tabrez Alam. In this confession, you've gobbled up my... ...share of Vaishali and Sitamarhi ransom. Where will you stock all the money? You want to churn butter even out of sandal. I've news you all are minting money... ...out of the police recruitment process. Don't get taken in by rumors, Tabrez Alam. Please sort out the Nandlal matter. It is creating havoc. There were protests today too. Greetings. - Greetings. Please wrap it up soon. Don't feast alone. My share must be delivered on time. Don't try to eat the sugarcane from the root. You will end up eating the mud as well. Such a dog. Here, call Gaya Singh. 12.5... 26... 75... and 13... Tabrez-bhai's call. Yes... yes... yes, Tabrez-bhai. Fine. I'll go there right away. Tell the doctor. I'm going out. - Yes. Pass the scarf. - Yes. What happened? - Doctor is in the bathroom. Greetings, sir. What a pain! They keep calling Tabrez-bhai for such trivial matters. What's the matter? Times are bad, jailor. How can one do business? What happened to the doctor? He's still in the bathroom. I'll have to set him right. How much time do you take, doctor? Living in the bathroom these days? I'll be back by lunch. - Fine, sir. Let's go, Mishra-ji. Greetings. Come. Jail hospital. Come, brothers. Make yourselves home. Yes. This is Nandlal's younger brother, Srilal. Oh, I was sorry to hear. But don't worry. I'll go all out to release your brother. Okay? They made a demand of 50 lakhs. From where will I get so much? I've already got it reduced to 50 lakhs. The men who picked up your brother... ...have risked their lives to do so. They've no insurance like your brother. I can't get the ransom reduced any further, that's all. Mandal uncle has come. Come. Wait here. I'll get Mr. Brij Kishore. Come on, Mandal, the list has not been finalized yet. The file is moving in and out of the Home Minister's office everyday. Hey, Ramjatan. What is it? This is Mr. Mandal. Show him the merit list file. Okay. What's the roll number? Sir... B 200777. Which quota have you applied under? Sir? Didn't I tell you? Whose candidate is he? I'm a Shastri Brahmin. And I don't have any other recommendation. Why are you wasting time? Where's the merit to have his name on the list? Ma'am, hand over that file. - That file has still not come. Ajay... the name was on the first list. But it was removed later. Hang on. Yes, we'll send it to you. Isn't there some solution, Brij Kishore? Don't you know the rate of an inspector? Can't the rate be reduced a bit? No one will bother will less than 5 lakhs. Who do we have to give it to? Brijkishore. He will get it done. From the minister to the peon, everyone has a share. What progress, DGP? It's been 7 days. There is a public outcry. Is the State Police sleeping? I want results. Raids and searches are on day and night. Very soon we'll... - Sir. What is this? Mr. Khan? Sir, investigation report. I'm working with many sources. We've detained 7 people. Tonight we're planning to raid several locations. This is the list, sir. Tabrez Alam's name is also on your list. He's suspected too, sir. We're keeping an eye on his hideouts. I want results within 24 hours. Right, sir. I want a report. Yes, sir. So according to you, Tabrez Alam's hiding the trader in his house? Yes, sir. Before taking any step investigate and get solid evidence. It's your responsibility. - Sir. Tabrez Alam's call. Yes, bhai. Nandlal's brother is a fraud, bhai. He has failed to pay thrice. But he'll straighten out. Given him time till morning. Where's he kept? In our Lalganj godown. Usman-bhai's son, our Naseem's there too. Shift him to another location. Khan's snooping around a lot. Yes bhai, right away. Hey, run! Police! Run! Run! Grab him! Surround him! Hold that one too! Why are you hitting us, sir? We've just come from Motihari. Stop! You can't touch us. Show me the arrest warrant. You're hitting me! MLA Tabrez Alam is my uncle. Pull him out! Why are you hitting me? - Shut up! Get up. No! No! This is the arrest warrant. - Don't shoot me. Then talk! You're a good kid. Co-operate with us. We'll let you off... as a government witness. Where is SP sir? Please come. Professor Shastri's son is here to do identification. We're letting them off after signing the bond. We were beaten badly, Bade Abba. Usman. - Yes, bhai. Take these two and go. Make them sit in the office. I'll sit in the office and have tea with you later. Right now let's talk here. You're working very hard. What to do? Some people continue on the wrong path. These are your own people. They may be your own men. For me they all are criminals. Whatever, we must acknowledge our own community. Don't insult my community by identifying it with criminals. So they are criminals? You've already made the judgment. And they're being punished. Wow! These poor people are the parents of these criminals. Tell them, here law and order ceases to exist behind the bars. You all go now. Come and collect your children's corpses in the morning. Right, Mr. Khan? I'd got you transferred here with a lot of hope. I regret that I couldn't live up to your hope. Do the identification carefully. These eyes are often mistaken. Pardon us, Bade Appa. I'm Madho washer man's son, Ramnath. I'll never make such a mistake again. Scared, aren't you? Lost your nerve in front of the cops. Couldn't bear the torture. You were scared shitless. You don't trust me. You've let me down. So many people are trying to scare me... ...to annihilate our community. Can I afford to be scared? Won't happen again, Bade Appa. Hey, don't be afraid, kiddo. You're still traumatized. This fear inside you can destroy our community. We are working for Him. There can be no compromise. Never mind, bhai. He didn't deserve to live. But he was our child. I can sacrifice a hundred Naseems to your principles. Madho washer man's son... Just see that his family has no problem. You don't worry at all, bhai. Congrats, Mr. Pandey! Your police freed Nandlal. Yes, yes. CM's leaving. - Regards, sir. Yes, sir. The car is ready. When Tabrez Alam has come himself, then the matter's serious. Tell us, is everything well? I'd send you a request. That wasn't passed, bhai. I'd brought it up in the cabinet too. It's not even 3 months yet. Besides, you got Anwar Khan posted to the district yourself. That's why I'm demanding his transfer immediately. It can't be done, bhai. The minority will get the wrong signal. But I'm the minority community. You're not running this country, are you? SP Khan will remain in Salampur. 95... 96... 97... 98... 99... 100. We've got Rs. 25,000 /- here. My account has 27.5. Again an engineer was picked up... - They've come. Come. Don't worry. Arrangements are made. Hang on. This is Mr. Verma. But from where did you get so much money? He's given 5 lakhs for a month. We'll have 4.5 after deducting the interest. Once you get admitted, we'll repay it all. How'll we repay it? It's absurd. Stop worrying about that, Mr. Honest. Once you start parading in your uniform... ...we can handle the collections. So you've definitely decided that you'll bribe them? What else? Consider it my misfortune and bang my head? My name was there on the first list. I cleared the written, physical and interview on my own merit. But it was struck off. What do I do? Protest or shoot them? Tell me, what do I do? You'll pay a bribe. Lady, my life is at stake. And when this is the only path, fine. I must have this job at any cost. Till yesterday you believed this was wrong. I believed, I'll continue to believe. But perhaps this is today's reality. Your result was good. But tell me. Would you get a seat in the medical college... ...if your father hadn't paid? Forget about me. Will your father agree? I'm not dragging him into this. Once I get recruited, then we'll see. Fill the application form properly. If you don't understand, ask. Okay? - Fine. Greetings. - Is this the time to come? It's been over 3 hours. If it wasn't for Mr. Mandal... Got delayed in the collection, uncle. Hey, move! One minute. One minute. One minute. Mr. Mandal's candidate, Bada Babu. Ajay Shastri. Take that out. See this. Money. Krishna - Yes, sir. Take it upstairs to Banka babu. - Yes, sir. Okay, thanks you. It's done. Let's move. Bada Babu, where's my name on the list? When your sweetheart is a policeman, what's there to fear? When your sweetheart is a policeman, what's there to fear? Hey, no. Today you can't say no. Yuck! You're drinking alcohol. No. He's lying. - They forced me to drink. Haven't done a robbery or theft. - Just a peg if drink. You've gone mad. What are you doing? Yes. I've gone mad. The list will be out in 2 days, my name's on it. Hey! Mr. Mishra from Dainik Jagaran. Greetings. - Greetings. Hello, Mr. Mishra. Sir, this is very unfair. What's the matter? You'd promised I'd be the first one to publish the police recruitment. So am I refusing? You are... Then how did Mr. Shastri get it? He's called a press conference in the morning at home. Congratulations. Aren't you the one? Yes, sir. I'm Ajay. Sir! Sir. Give me your blessings. Why are you standing here? Bring out the box. Offer everyone sweets. It's such a happy occasion that I've come myself. Your son's name is on the merit list. See it in tomorrow's paper. I've seen the list. My statement is also appearing tomorrow. You're my teacher, greater than God. I'll lay down my life for you. I request, don't punish me publicly through the press. You mean I shouldn't talk about the crores of rupees... ...your ministry has taken for the police recruitment? Yes, that is the request. What if I expose you and your government? You can only levy allegations not prove them. But your son's job is definitely in your hands. You've come to strike a deal? I'll always regret that you were ever my student. But what I'll regret even more is that you thought... ...me capable of this dirty deed. Forget my son's job, Dhinkar. Even if his life is at stake, I'll not make this deal. You may leave. I know, no one can influence Guru-ji. Still your work can be done. Just ask him to wait for a while, a month or two. I'll take care of it later. Father. Can't you hold on for a few days? What do you mean? The Minister wants you to keep quiet for a couple of months. Then I'll get the job, father. You know that is impossible. I've already called a press conference. Please, father. It's a matter of my life. I've never asked you for anything. I've done everything myself. Please delay your statement by a few days. I know how important this job is for you, Ajay. But I hope you'll give due importance to... ...your father's lifelong struggle against corruption. I've been doing that all my life, father. But I can't bear the burden of your principles any more. Your principles, struggle, path of truth is all really great, father. But it can't do anything. You'll give your statement, a commission will sit... ...Pandey will not quit. But my life will be ruined. This is my last chance. Even after the humiliation, Pandey is ready to give me the job. Please, father. For the sake of your son... My own child thinks like this? It's shameful! Just one blow of failure crushed you? I never had high hopes of any major success from you. But today I'm disappointed. Dinkar Pandey attracted you with the bait of a job... ...and you switched loyalties? You didn't think what would the world say if Raghuvansh Shastri... ...compromised his principles for his son's selfish ends? I don't know about the world, father. But I will say, I didn't get a job because of you. I'm sorry you think that way. But I'll bear it. So you don't care about me? Actually you never have. That is not true. You don't care about my principles. Yes. I don't care. Your greatness is a sham. You call my need for a job selfish... ...but did you ever think... ...even your desire to be great is selfish? Sorry, father. You only wanted me to personify your big ideals. I could never become your son. Do you want to die? Lunatic bastard! Coffee. What happened, Ajay? Life doesn't end with one defeat. One defeat? I think you're losing count. I understand your pain but please... ...don't harbor this bitterness, Ajay. Your father has only done what he has been doing all his life. You're right. By sacrificing my future he has definitely... ...become greater in people's eyes. Whether anyone's punished by his allegations or not... ...l'm already punished... for life. It makes no difference, Ajay. Try something else. Please, Megha. Don't talk about something else. Nothing will work out for me. And don't try to heal my wounds with your pity. You're fast becoming a different person. I'm going. It's getting late. Why are you worrying when we are there? Ajay's our child. When will everything come to use? No sugar for me. - Bucchi, bring biscuits. Ajay, son. Yes? How are you? I'm fine. Why are you so upset? Forget about the police job. From tomorrow you come to our wholesale godown. What do I have to do there? You can do anything. We have an entire staff there. You can just... Then why am I required? You should be grateful to him for offering you a job. You can at least write their accounts. Thanks, uncle. But perhaps father doesn't know... ...I was always weak at math's. I can't work for you. That's him. If I'd known he's Mr. Shastri's son... ...then why would I have lent him your money, Murli-bhai. So now you know. We'll retrieve it from his dad. Hang on. But one month's interest is cut. There's still 20 days left to return the money. I can't give you 20 minutes. God knows what is your father's next hit. Everyday he bloody sits making statements. Look, you're concerned with your money. Don't talk rubbish about my father. I'll return your money in 3 days. Touchy about your father? Okay, 3 days. After that you won't get a single moment, understand. Keep it in mind. Come on. Where is your motorcycle? - Forget it. He has come. Listen. - What's the matter? I want the money back. What money? Get out of the way. Look, we'd borrowed the 5 lakhs. We've to return it, please. Whatever. How do I return it? - We're in trouble. What do I do? Did you give to me? Yes, you'd taken it. You'd given it inside. Once inside, the money doesn't come out again. This is a government well. It has to come back. I'd paid for the job. It didn't materialize. You have to return it. Let go of me! Hey! Leave his collar! What money? I'd put your name on the list with my own hand. It was struck off because of your esteemed father. Go, hold his collar to retrieve your money. Whatever happened to you is because of your father. All the results are bloody jammed. He has started the enquiry routine... ...and 213 candidates are in a limbo. They should in fact retrieve their money from him. That's right. We should. Before pointing fingers at ministers and government one... ...should consider a thousand people's future would be ruined. Who are you to get aggressive, Go to your father and tell him to stop being a Gandhi. It creates immense disturbances. Hasn't Ajay come yet? No. He is never this late. You have your dinner. Come on, fast! What's the matter? Good we got him here. We'll save money on the phone call. Now get me my payment and take your father back. Hurry up, pick up the professor. Hang on. Don't you dare touch my father! You had said 3 days. I've time till the evening. Yes, but you can't be trusted. You didn't go home for 2 nights. What if you run away today? I'm not going anywhere, bhai. I'll do anything to get your money back. Remember, we're watching you and your father round the clock. If I do not get my money, then buy a garland... ...and incense stick for your father's last rites. Understand. Come on. They're no other way left for us. We've tried everything, but we can't arrange the money. I've talked to Sukhi uncle. He has all kinds of deal. We just have to kidnap a guy and take him to the middleman. That's it. This will be the first and the last time. After all, your father's security is at stake. I just pity the professor. Because Murli will not spare your father. This is the party from Hajipur, Sales tax inspector, Banka Lal. He has property worth crores in Patna, bank balance, cash and all. All the information is here. When will you deliver? This is Naga-bhai. He'll finance your car, guns everything. Tell him what you want. First tell me, when will the delivery be? We'll try today itself. The goods must reach me understand. You're first timers, if you get nervous there will be blunders. Where do we drop off Banka Lal? As soon as the work is done, call me. You'll get the address. But remember, be punctual. And if there is any defect, I'll cancel the delivery. What? There should be no deep wound on the man. If he dies on the way, no payment. The rest on delivery. I should get my phone back. Come tomorrow. Your work will be done. He's leaving in a silver esteem, 1226. Who's with him? - The driver. Okay, you follow him. Hello. I'm coming after buying fruits. I've already got some, you just come soon. It's time for the movie. Coming. Is your brother ready? - Long back. Don't stop here, Yadav. Let's go home. Hey Bunty! What are you doing? Bunty! What a mess! Can't you see? What's happening? Who are these people? What are you doing? I am being kidnapped. What? He's being kidnapped. The car isn't starting. The car is not starting. Stop that rickshaw. Come on. Catch it. Put him in! Hurry! Calm down. Get his diary. Look for Gaya Singh's number. He's the one who must have kidnapped my husband. Call the police, brother. Are you mad? Why will Gaya kidnap him? Gaya takes protection money from him. His security is Gaya's responsibility. I'm Banka Lal's brother-in-law speaking. It's Banka Lal's brother-in-law. What is it? My brother-in-law has been kidnapped. Don't crack jokes. With Gaya Singh around, no one has the guts to touch Banka Lal. I'm dying here and you think it's a joke? God will punish the culprit! - He called himself! Call everyone from Nepal to Begusurai. Get the phone from my shoe. - Yes. - Call Murli. Amazing! Who's this new player? Don't play a double game with me, Murli. I'm furious. My life is dear to me. I'll not make such a mistake even in my dreams. Why only me? No one will dare. It must be an outside party. Find out, Murli. Ask each and everyone and tell me. Banka Lal is my client. Whoever it is will die a dog's death. The phone is ringing. What? The damn phone is ringing! Stop! Have you stuffed shit in your ears? I'm ringing for the third time. Hello. - What happened? The car had an accident. We're bringing him in a rickshaw. In a rickshaw! Why didn't you call me? Please tell me quickly, where to deliver? Leave him at the highway before the Pipra turn. Understood. Hello, Murli-bhai. Cut out the greetings. Gaya Singh's looking out for you. Gaya Singh? Who did you give the contract to? That's the problem with a new party. Hurry up and check the stuff. If you could settle with us... Such a dangerous slip! I almost changed my mind. Left the car at the crime scene. Hello. Murli here, Naga-bhai. How are you? I'm busy now, Murli-bhai, later. Picking up stuff in double shits at the bypass. Is it the State tax inspector from Hajipur? Don't talk nonsense, Murli. I don't pick up stuff worth small changes. Understood. Whatever you do, think about it. Banka Lal is Gaya Singh's client. He's in a frenzy searching for the kidnappers. Leave him. Cancel it. We don't want the delivery. Let's go. What's the matter? Don't want the delivery. We've picked him up with great difficulty, Naga-bhai. We've risked our lives... I can't risk my life. Leave the door. First come out. Make our payment. You! Want your payment! Beat up the rascals! Leave my hand. - Naga sir, there is no point in fighting. It's a matter of life and death. Please. Because of me, my friends... - Shut up! Full 5 lakhs, Naga sir. Run! Run! Come on! Quick! Brother-in-law! Untie him fast! The police is here. Don't worry. Naga-bhai. Naga is on the line. You're becoming very daring, Naga. There's no question about it, Gaya. As soon as I found out he is your man, I canceled the delivery. Who were they? It's a gang from Salmapur itself. Some Ajay Shastri. Ajay Shastri! Yes. What Mr. DSP! I plough the land, sow the seeds, nurture them... ...and the Professor Shastri's son will take away the harvest? The case is in Hajipur. It's not in my district. But the criminals are from your district. I'm sending 1 lakh. I want all 4 by the morning. Why so much rancor, they all are new kids. And they've failed. It's not about passing or failing. In my area, they had the guts to pick up my client. It's a very serious matter. It's another district and needs 4 warrants. It's too much work, Gaya. After the magistrate and police station, I won't have anything left. When it comes to money, you become shameless. Get the work done first. We'll see later. Double the payment. It's so bloody unfair. Everyone wants to rob you. Surround the house! Move! Check there! Where are you barging! Move! Where are you going? Listen, what's the matter? What's going on? Stop these people! Will you tell us on what charges are you arresting him? The charges are section 365, 384, 120B and 302, professor. What was the police saying? Kidnapping, ransom, conspiracy to murder. Come on! Move! Sir, this is Professor Shastri's... - Of course, I know him. He has chosen the right field. He'll make his father proud. Who else have you all kidnapped? Sir, should we make his report? That we'll do. But first let's get him to confess. Ajay. What happened? Could I talk to him for a moment? Yes, yes, but first let us speak to him. You sure have guts! Who gave you the contract? Speak up! Who are your other 2 gang members? What are you staring at? Shall I call that madam inside? Sir has come. He has called you. Let's go. Professor Shastri has also come. - Bring him along. Father, these people have arrested Ajay. So what are you doing here? Let's go from here. This is a place for criminals not for you. Father, let me just speak to Ajay. Ajay please, say something. Come on, move. - You go home. Ajay... Ajay... Let's go. Look, Professor we really respect you. But the charges are very serious. Come. They have planned and kidnapped a government officer. Even then, Mr. SP. The boy wasn't caught at the crime scene. If you want the matter could... No. There would be obstruction in the process of the law. If the allegations are not proven, he will be declared innocent. Otherwise, for the kind of crime he has committed... ...he should be punished severely. Move! Come on! Boss's word is completely ready. These guys will have a grand welcome. Come on! Hey! Move! Who is Ajay Shastri? Tell me! Come on! - I'm Ajay Shastri. Hold that rascal! Hot blooded rascal, speak! Speak up! How did you have the bloody guts to lay a hand on my man! Come on, talk! I'll ruin you! You dare to stare at me? Lick this! And swear that you'll never do this again. Lick! Remember this. Ajay. How did all this happen, Ajay? Please say something. Why have you come here? I don't understand what to do. Admission at Ranchi has been confirmed. I met your father. He... Please don't talk about Pundit Raghuvanshi Shastri. Don't say that, Ajay. It's a bad dream, it will pass. Your whole life lies ahead. Your life. Don't associate with a man like me and ruin it. Ajay... - I'm a criminal. Meeting me is not appropriate for you. Please don't come here again. Ajay... Pick up the party from Nepal. Gaya Singh never fails to pay. DSP Shukla. Police department dogs can smell money. Come. Get some beer. Boss has come. Major conference going on? Did I disturb you at the wrong time? When do you ever come at the right time, Shukla-ji? Tell me, what can I do for you? Leave the hosting to me. You just give me the money. I've already given you 1 lakh. Now should I gift you the Taj Mahal? Double of that was the deal. I've given you so much till now. But your habit of begging remains. Look, I'm working for you. That you will do for money. You will even sell yourself. How much do you have in hand? - Rs. 50,000/-. Spare me, DSP sir. Even a prostitute doesn't haggle so much. Sorry, if you felt bad. It's 50 less. But it will do. Hello. Sudhakar from the DGP office. Boss has called you to the headquarters urgently at 4 o'clock. Sir. Lots of complaints against you. Have to take action now. Complaints? Against me? Tabrez Alam's people are very angry with you. They're pressurizing for your transfer. Gaya Singh! What you want is impossible. Let me meet him once. I'll talk to him. Okay, I'll try. Sir, he wants to talk to you. DSP sir, give me a minute. - Quick! I don't have time. Help me, sir. Please arrange for my bail. Why? You help all kinds of people. Give me a chance too. I will be very useful to you. What are you saying? If sir gets angry then you'll rust forever in jail. Once chance! I'll do anything for this favor. Come. - Anything. Get me released. You'll not be disappointed. Come! I can't come inside. I'll wait for you here. Do the identification properly. How much time will it take? - That depends on you. If you like it inside let me know we'll book you. Mr. Shukla, you're joking. Come. The court magistrate. Sir, Banka Lal. He has to do the identification. Greetings. Sir none of them was there. Look at them properly. What's there to see? I was blindfolded. Come on, take them inside. Sir, may I leave too? - Okay. What are you saying! I won't go back to my old life of failure. I've chosen my goal and I'm going to get it. Tomorrow we'll be bailed out. Then you all decide what you'll do. I will be successful at any cost. I'll take the bag. - No, let's go. Here's my seat. Megha dear, eat on time. - Yes. Do call as soon as you reach Ranchi. - Yes, father. Okay, dear. - Bye. You are lucky. 3 cases of the sales tax offices are with me. He agreed. Thank you, sir. Thanks to you I'm free today. So what are your plans now? Mr. Shukla, just tell me, which person in town... ...is Tabrez desperate to kidnap? The accounts will reach by evening. - Alright. Spotted 13 guards outside and 8 inside. Seems like military security. We'll need a whole army to penetrate this place. There is vigilance at the main gate too. Arrange for a car. What calculation is this! Our tender is right on top. Hello. - Sir, the chartered accountant on line. Yes, put him on line. Vibhuti Bhushan here. Just received a call from income tax office. They're coming for a raid. - What? There was a raid just 6 months ago. It's a new director. A greedy rascal. Tell the security to welcome them properly. Look after him. All set? Go and manage. - Okay, sir. Good morning, sir. Please, come. Mr. Subhramanyam, you stay at the gate. Nobody in or out. Yes, sir. No entry, no exit. Start checking the office. - Yes, sir. Are there dacoits here? - No, sir. No, dacoits. Such tight security? Problem? - No problem, sir. Security, wait outside. Interrogate the security, quick. Show them the photo in the file and get a complete record. Who comes when and goes when. Why have you kept such huge guards, Mr. Sooraj? I'm Devanand. I know, sir. Please come. This security is not for you. Then get them out. - Go. Have to start investigation. Time is money. That's what I'm saying, sir. Why waste time? Take this money and save time. - Offering bribe? How much? Boss, locked up all guards. Thank you. Time is money. Come. You've no clue who you're messing with. I've already taken the risk. Now come. Where are you taking me? How much do you want? I'll pay you here. - Come along now. Make the demand draft later. - What are you doing? Move! - Where are you taking me? Open it! Put it in the car! Hurry up! Keep quiet! Come on! Move! What are you doing? Come on. Sit. What? Soorajmal has been kidnapped? Tabrez-bhai's call. Tabrez-bhai's on the line. Bhai, Tabrez-bhai. Yes. What's wrong? In the bathroom too long? Greetings. - Bhai... Amazing! Your clothes are stripped off right under the nose... ...and you didn't even realize. My people are looking all over. He can't escape. No matter who he is. You'd taken the challenge to kidnap Soorajmal, Gaya Singh. And I had faith in you. I won't let you down, Tabrez-bhai. Just give me 24 hours. Why can't you get Shukla on line? It's ringing. He isn't picking up... Try again, rascal! Can't show my back to Tabrez-bhai! I won't spare that dog! Quickly! Hurry up! Sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir. Sir, one minute. Any news of the kidnappers? Any demand for ransom? Which gang is suspected? We're investigating. We'll soon come to a conclusion. Sir, what about the ransom amount? Within a month another sensational kidnapping. At 3 in the afternoon in broad daylight. The owner of Sooraj Group of Companies, Mr. Soorajmal... ...was kidnapped by unidentified people. We have with us Soorajmal's younger brother, Mr. Chandmal. Mr. Chandmal, there were rumors... ...because of your brother's political aspirations... ...there was rising tension between him and MLA Tabrez Alam. It is difficult for me to say anything right now. My brother's life is at risk. Any phone call demanding ransom? A few days ago someone named Gaya Singh had threatened us. Shut up, rascal! Gaya Singh will make hollow threats? Mr. Gaya Singh. - Where had you vanished, Shukla-ji? I'm tired of trying your number. I was busy with your work, Gaya Singh. Your prey is in my custody already. I'm just coming. Hold on to him. Never harbored as strong a desire to kill a person as now, Shukla-ji. Who is he? - Go see for yourself. And there is no need for this. I've taken so much from you. This time it's for free. You? Despite having licked my spilt you haven't improved. This will cost you dearly. Spare my life. I'd underestimated you. I'll give you whatever you want. I'll give you as much money as you want. I swear on my kids. Forgive me, bhai. Look, I'll lick your spit if you say. I swear. Forgive me. Lick! Lick! Lick! Lick! Everything is finished. Usman, see that his kids have no problems. Get the last rites done properly. - Yes, bhai. Usman. - Yes. Which kid had Gaya beaten up in the jail? - Who, bhai? The one Khan had called to identify our men. He? Yes. His name is Ajay Shastri. Find him. - Yes, bhai. Fast. Stop! Stop! Who is it? Come out. Usman, shoot him! - Put him in the car and take him. Tabrez-bhai! Tabrez-bhai! Please listen to me once. You may kill me if you wish after that. Why? Why should I listen to you? How dare you think of challenging Tabrez! I have certainly dared but not to challenge you. Rather I had come to surrender... unarmed. Why did you do all this? I just wanted to meet you, Tabrez-bhai. Meet me? Is this the way to meet anyone? What do you think of yourself? You will kill Gaya? What if I shoot you? I settled my scores with Gaya. I killed him after he licked my spit. But the person who couldn't kidnap Soorajmal despite... ...having your support then he is not worthy of you. And do you consider yourself worthy? Have a good look at me. You won't be betrayed. I can give my life for you. You can give your life for me... how much is your life worth? I don't want men who give their lives. I can take lives too! Where is Soorajmal? He is outside in the car dickey. Hey! Open the gate. He will come to his senses in a while. Bhai, what shall we do with him? Call the doctor and inform his relatives. Give me one chance, Tabrez-bhai. I will work only for you. Soorajmal is conscious now. Feel at ease. This is like your home. Your family will be arriving shortly. Is everything fine? Stay calm! Don't worry, sir. He is our man. You suffered due to a misunderstanding. Oh God! You are fine, right? - Come. - We were worried about you. Chandmal, there is no need for this. You're one of our own. Take it as an offering, Tabrez-bhai. It's because of you that I am seeing my brother alive. Well then, I'm building the district medical college. You can add a few bricks there. And listen, you may give this man whatever you feel like. He has brought your brother here. Brother! I'm fine. Bhai, what do we do with this guy? He is educated. He first proved his talent and then asked for work. But bhai, he is professor Shastri's son. He's hardly anybody's son now. Come on! Easy! Easy! What is the matter? Doctor sir, it is an emergency. - You all move out. Catch his leg! Hold it properly! Sir, we've just received a call. - Where's it from? Sir, it is an international call. Check the location of the mobile. They must be using foreign sim cards SP sir! SP sir! We've heard that they've demanded for 2 crores. Stop here. You can't go ahead. Everything will be fine. Nothing will happen to Doctor sir. What's the matter? I need information on the call that had just come. Information? You should have the information. Without information... - For God's sake, why don't you all cooperate? We are doing our best. And look, doctor's life is at risk. Then let us save his life. Look, please don't lose hope. If you pay the ransom today, then... A new toy has come. One will cost 12.5 lakhs. You may anywhere but the result is the same. Good weapon! Gentlemen, I am interested. Thank you very much! - Thank you. Come. Listen, this doctor issue is going to heat up. You go to Central Jail for a while. You'll be arrested for that old Sales Tax Inspector case. We'll issue a warrant due to some new evidence. Gaya Singh's ward is also vacant there. - Usman-bhai! I've told the jailer to clean it up. It'll be painted according to your choice. That'll be fine. You operate from there... without worrying. Fine, bhai! Jailor sir is inside. Greetings, sir! - Greetings. - Come, this way. Come sir! Greetings! - Greetings Ajay! Greetings sir! Greeting Ajay! - Forgive me, brother! I made a mistake. Forgive me. Kashi! - Come on go out! Come on, quick! Sit! Ask the jail doctor to meet me. - Okay! I'll go out in the evening. Hello, control room? - Yes sir. Tell the DSP to send another Patrolling party to Shri Rampur Road. Quick move! It's sir! Sir! - Have you checked the print out? There have been 7 calls from that number. Who is the registered user? - Sir, some Ashiq Ali Khan. The address is fake. Sir, We have arrested the sim card dealer. Good! Keep tracking. Tell the mobile operators to track... ...the location along with the call time. Okay? - Yes sir! What is inside this? Sir! What is it, sir? What is in this? Open it! - There is nothing. It is stuff related to electricity. You all must be careful. - Okay sir! If there's any suspicious activity... ...then inform us immediately. - Yes sir! - Yes. What's the matter Mr. Shukla? Usman, how many times I have told... ...you not to call me on mobile. You will get me killed someday. It's urgent, Mr. Shukla. Have to take a parcel out. We need cover. Khan's turned all of Salampur into a fort. I can't get your parcel out. Hurry up! Quick! Okay. Let's go. Close the gate. Bhai, the money has come. We have to deliver to the doctor. Khan's checking every car. Call up DSP. - Yes bhai. Prepare the report fast. - Yes sir. Okay gentlemen. - Sir! Hello. - Greetings. Tabrez-bhai will speak. In half an hour my car will pass Kalambagh Chowki. I'll be obliged if you come there yourself. - Yes. Where is he headed? - Sir, towards Kalambagh Chowki. Okay! Move! Show us what is in it? It seems the D.G. P hasn't reached yet. See, who's there? - Yes, bhai. Who's in the car? Each and every car should be checked! Why are you listening to All India Radio? Lift the barrier. MLA himself is sitting in the car. Sir! - Check all the vehicles. - Yes. Also check their arms licenses now. - Right sir! What's the matter? I am there. Get the dickey opened, the car will be checked. Whose order is this? I don't need orders to check your car. Yes you do! You certainly do! DGP sir tell him, he is a servant... ...of the people and I am their protector. He'll check my car, is it? MLA! MLA sir, please go ahead. Pardon the mistake. I'll take care of him. Sorry, I arrived late. Check my car! I'll plead for forgiveness for this. Please go ahead. Oh my God! Anwar! Anwar, tell me what happened? - Nothing. Give me a moment. - No! Anwar, please say something! Anwar! Okay. What can I say? Everything got ruined. Shame on me! He hit me and I could do nothing. What kind of a police do I serve when I can't protect myself? I'm tired of paying the dual price of being a Muslim. One has to pay a price for the truth. You are a true Muslim! And I've always been proud to be your wife. You can't shutter my pride! I won't let you lose! Please don't bother about your son's life or mine. Your prestige comes first. And if you lose your self-respect, then how will I live? Don't spare the man who's raised a hand on you! No matter what... no matter how long it takes. Don't spare! Where are you building the hall? Here! It will be 70' by 50'. Home Minister Pandey? Why don't you take my call these days? What to do, sir? You keep returning... ...to single point programme of money. I too have limits. You plan to hog the doctor's case amount. Sir, in the agreement of give and take, if... ...you intend to just take then the accounts will go haywire! It's not right if outsiders get all the contracts of any district. I understood. It seems as if the accounts with you need to be properly settled. With the blessings of God even... ...the building should turn out good. Photocopy these papers, fast! - Yes sir. Hello! - Mr. Mishra! Come. Sit! Hand it over to Shastri-ji only. The court hearing is at 4. Shastri-ji, this time you have got hold of strong evidence. But how did you get these papers? - Forget it, why worry? You've many well-wishers. Today at the High court professor Raghuvan Shastri... ...mocked the non-bailable warrants issued by the... ...government and files a case against the government's... ...carelessness in several criminal cases. On the basis of my evidence the court has given strict... ...instructions to the government to execute all... ...delayed and non-bailable warrant within 24 hours. And to inform the court after arresting the concerned criminals. All that is fine. But please answer one question, Shastri-ji. You are crusading here. And your son is enjoying the protection... ...of jail and working wonders! What's the connection? Excuse me, I don't have a son by the name Ajay Shastri. So will leaders like Tabrez Alam... ...Shamsher, Kali Jha be behind bars? Long live Tabrez Alam! Long live Tabrez Alam! Long live Tabrez Alam! Long live Tabrez Alam! Move! What's the matter? There's an arrest warrant in the name of MLA Tabrez Alam. So arrest me, I am Tabrez Alam. - Yes, I am Tabrez Alam! Arrest me! Arrest me! Long live Tabrez Alam! Long live Tabrez Alam! Long live Tabrez Alam! - Look we have the court order. Till there is even a drop of blood... ...in my body no one can touch our leader. Long live Tabrez Alam! Long live Tabrez Alam! There is nothing to worry about. Let the police in. I now belong to the people, so this is inevitable. Even Lord Ram had to suffer exile. It's evident that our hopeless, failed government has... ...become so scared of me that it cannot bear to see me free. Move behind! Move behind! Massive protests have accompanied... ...the arrest of Tabrez Alam. Another police van has just gone through the gates. But the media has been kept away from the gates. Akash Ranjan, Salampur, Aaj Tak. Come... I was waiting for you. With your permission. My child has come home. Can I talk to him for 2 minutes? Yes. Bhai! - Yes. You had to suffer this because of my father. Oh come on! This is not the work of your father. There are others behind it. That home minister Dinkar Pandey. He is the one behind this. - One minute! Doctor Agarwal's report has been filed in the court. And even the hospital's jail ward needs to be refurnished. Bhai, Munna will stay with you. See, I have no problem. And since you're there I am not even worried. Usman. - Yes. - Ajay will handle everything. Let him work. 'Tabrez Alam set up his headquarters... ...in jail and outside Ajay took charge.' 'He exceeded Tabrez's expectations.' 'The 27 big and small gangs which were working from... ...within the security of Salampur Jail were... ...either crippled or taken over by Ajay Shastri.' 'According to police and other statistics, within a year, in... ...places like Bettiah, Bagha, Motihari, Rohtas, Kaimur... ...Baksar, Natanda, Samastipur, Siwan, Munger... ...Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Purnia, Shekhpura and... ...Patna there were over 2400 kidnapping cases... ...and hundreds of murders for ransom.' 'And dozens of criminal files were... ...opened in the name of Ajay Shastri.' 'He even established connections with hundreds of... ...gangs of Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.' Good evening. - Good evening sir! Come! Have a seat, sir Come and have a seat, sir. Come and have a seat, sir. Let's talk something. If we click then we'll enjoy a dazzling night together... Come and have a seat, sir. Come! Come! Waiter! What will you have? - Your money. You are very direct. I liked it. Baby, walk towards me. Nice and slowly. Baby! Baby! Your work will be done. - I trust you. I am ripe and juicy. I am full of love. I am ripe and juicy. I am full of love. You will go mad. If my blouse opened up. The fire inside me is blazing bright. It's impossible to quench my thirst. Come to me, my beloved. Come! 'Ajay gave a new direction to the kidnapping enterprise.' 'Lt wasn't a problem if the ransom... ...money could not be paid in full.' 'With Ajay Shastri there was the facility of installments.' 'Businessmen, doctors, officers, contractors, teachers... ' 'People from all professions and... ...their families lived in constant fear.' 'Ajay Shastri had become a hero... ...for millions of unemployed youth.' 'Every day new criminal gangs started mushrooming! ' 'As Ajay's power grew, so did his enemies.' 'Some outside and some within.' So, didn't you get the railway contract? I had warned you not to mess with Ramdhani Singh. Usman, don't give pointless commentary. Speak as much your wit permits. Come. That's true! Ajay Shastri pounces like a dog. Boss, he won't come after we have thrashed his people. We should've killed him. It seems the beating wasn't enough. So you too have come to light your own pyre? He wants to be a contractor! Shoot them both! You are mistaken Ramdhani Singh! I've brought him to apologize. He made a mistake by eyeing your business. Come on, apologize. Come on, apologize! Come on! Come on! From now on be it railways or highways... ...no contract in North Bihar will be passed... ...without Ajay Shastri's approval! 'Success and power had got to Ajay's head.' 'Murders, extortion, kidnappings.' 'The list of Ajay's crimes kept increasing.' Salim has brought the Kolkatta party. He says that you'd asked him to pick up the outside goods? We'll have to. Our business is growing. We're also operating in UP & Nepal. How's the party? He's the son of a millionaire business family. He got married recently. The middleman's demand is 25. Understood, he's the son of that building company's owner. That Surati gang of Dhanbad had picked him up. Usman bhai, the party's okay. You get the payment done. Our 50 lakhs is safe. - It'll be your responsibility. It is always so. Get the payment done. Rascal! He overdoes things! It was a grand wedding. He must... ...have got a good amount of dowry. They are government contractors. Hey! In which other banks do you have accounts? He is just pulling an act. He was pretending over the phone too. Nobody's coming to release him. Kill the rascal. Let's not waste time. Please don't talk of killing me! I called up Kolkatta in front of you. The money will come. Trust me. Ajay bhai, the party's arrived. See, they've come. I told you that the money would come. Bhai, it's a lady. Who? Darling, I have come. - Megha! - Are you fine? How are you? - I'm all right! The money... - I have got it. Your life is most precious. We'll just leave. I'll just be back. - Megha! Don't leave me, Megha! Sorry, I got late. The flight got delayed in Kolkatta itself. You could've called. Why did you bother to come? From the past 16 days I have got calls... ...from Kolkata, Dhanbad & everywhere else. I lost all faith. I'm fortunate that you all kidnapped him. I'll at least be able to retrieve him. I've brought the entire amount. Get it counted. I didn't know he... - How would you know? We got married on the 22nd of last month. I had called home and I spoke to your father. Megha! Megha, where are you? Coming! Let me give them the money. If you'll let us go soon then we've an afternoon flight... Megha, I'd never... - Please! It's better if we don't talk about ourselves. Any way you are not the Ajay I once knew. And the way you are now, I don't want to know about it. Get this money counted. There's no need for this. Take the money back. Kashi, let him go. I can't do that. If I get my husband without paying, people will speculate. Ajay Shastri released him without payment. What'll I say? You'll have to take the money! I don't want to be shamed by your charity. Let's go, beloved! Come on. Thank you. You have been very kind. You are God for us. Let's go. Go and put this in her car. Go! As if I've not earned anything for you till now, Usman bhai. It doesn't mean that you can squander away the money. 50 lakhs don't come easy! Deduct it from my share. Don't brag about your share. We give you that. Don't forget, without Bhai's support you are worth nothing. Fine, bhai. The deed is done. I'll make amends somehow. What amends will you make? You'd already lost the girl, now you've lost the money. Why do we do all this? Because we've to do Allah's work. If I compromise here, how will I answer there? Usman's not wrong. The ethics of our business is strict. Ask him, he's lost a son over one mistake. You are my own. I trust you. I'll suffer definitely if I lose you. Grandpa, I have a music class today. Have you taken everything, books and all? Come on. You are late. So what happened? Then drop us to school in your car. Okay now come. You've left your water bottle again. Where is it? Grandpa! - Leave them! What are you doing? Stop them! Someone stop them! Police, they've taken my children. Stop them! I've got ruined, Mr. Raghuvansh. Oh God! What happened, Dwarka? You... They snatched my Munni and Bablu from me! What? When? Just now. I was dropping them to the bus stop. So let's go to the police. Nothing will happen. You know what the police will do. Now you only can do something? Me? Okay, tell me, whom, shall I speak to? Talk to Ajay. What're you saying Dwarka? How can I? Please talk to Ajay once. He'll know the kidnappers. They can't say no to him. Raghuvansh, sitting in jail he can... ...save my children at one phone call. Please talk to him. Dwarka, you know that I can't do that. Mr. Shastri, why don't you want to talk to Ajay Shastri? Would you speak to him if he wasn't your son? Would you like to make an appeal to Ajay through our channel? What do people have to do? My innocent children have gone. Now people will just watch the drama? Why should anyone bother? Nobody's going to help. Let's go. Nobody's going to help! Since last week the increase in kidnappings in Salampur... ...and neighboring areas has rattled the entire state! Early this morning, near Gangapur, Madanlal... ...Saxeriya and his family were kidnapped. Salim has kidnapped. Find out the ransom demanded. I have found out. It'd 50 lakhs. Call him up. Usman bhai, Ajay's calling. After so many years, a baby boy has taken birth here. It's truly his blessing. Tabrez bhai has come. Greetings! - Greetings! I'm so lucky you have come! I'd almost lost hope. You've had a son at this age. How can I not participate in this happiness? What jail can stop me from meeting my people? Come. He's called again! Disconnect it! What happened? - He is disconnecting. Let it be. I know whom he's with. Sir, you name my son. Your phone is ringing. - Sorry Ajay bhai, I was a little busy. So are you free now? Want to talk here or... - What behaviour is this! That's what I am asking him? Whose weight is he throwing around? You are speaking beyond your stature. Usman, what stature are you talking about? The one that you have built through these impotent fools! Ajay! - Don't shout! If I raise my voice then everyone will tremble. Seems your status and height have really increased young man! What's this commotion about? Tabrez bhai, I never bother about myself. But it's about my father's honour. That I'll not tolerate. Go! We'll talk later. Go! Bhai, it's enough! I can't bear it anymore! Let's finish Ajay off! - Usman! Don't be a fool to put out fire with fire! Don't provoke him. Everything has a right time. Come. One minute. Home Minister Pandey's people have come. He'd called me too. He wants to meet you. What's the harm in meeting? Nobody will crucify you. Let's go. Come. Greetings! Come. These are the two kids, right? Tabrez got it done, purposely, he... ...dragged you in and defamed your father. I'll rescue the kids. Have some tea. Tabrez is making you weak. He can't bear to see your strength. You may earn the world for him but you'll get nothing. I know your worth. Not the Muslim who is just filling... ...his coffers and stacking criminal files in your name. So you want me to work for you? You are not getting any income from Tabrez... ...bhai so you want a direct share from me? Your views are so limited. I want you to join my party. There's a by-election for the Motipur Vidhan Sabha seat. I want you to fight from there. I will get you elected, then the sky is the limit. You'll be in the government. You don't have to give me an answer right now. Think about it. You are my mentor's son. I'll always be your well-wisher. One thing is for sure! Under Tabrez you'll only be exploited and humiliated. Get him to hear this. You'll earn good money. - Yes. So you want me to work for you? You are not getting any income from Tabrez... ...bhai so you want a direct share from me? Your views are so limited. I want you to join my party. There's a by-election for the Motipur Vidhan Sabha seat. I want you to fight from there. Thank you! Meet Usman bhai. - Yes sir. Home Minister must resign! What other photos are out? - Not mine For the secret sting operation going on for the last 3 months... ...our camera has captured many ministers and... ...senior Government officers taking bribes. You know the rules of the world! Don't worry. - Our work must be done. Mr. Sharma's been taken care of. The CM... - What'll the Chief Minister do? We're there, we'll do it. This is peanuts! - Give! So many people filled the tender and only yours got passed. The 3rd of last month at his house, minister Dayashankar. In the role of supply contractors of the police... ...department, Home Minister's wife Sarla... ...Pandey is seen taking bribe worth 20 lakhs. But he'd said double. Hope the work will be done fast. You don't worry! Assume your work is done. Our camera has captured every other instances of open bribery. They will be made public on Tuesday. In a press conference at Media Centre. There will be an open debate on corruption. Is your government taking moral... ...responsibility for this scam and resigning? It is the Chief Minister's decision. As for this scandal, let the enquiry be completed. Everything will be clarified. But your wife was on camera... - Totally baseless allegation! This tape will be examined and the results will be clear. We'll get to the root of this conspiracy. The person or organization misleading... ...the public will not be spared. Sir, journalist Akash Ranjan's called a pres conference. Where the entire video... - Our lawyers... If the press conference is still held, we won't sit idle. Mr. Minister! No matter what it costs, get me bail. It's important to get out of here. - Okay bhai. A man lying ill in the hospital jail ward for the past 3... ...months, no charge sheet filed, no proof... ...found, not even a single witness. Till when will the police torture him? My client, Tabrez Alam, has been released on bail. Congratulations! Congratulations! Long live Tabrez bhai! Long live Tabrez bhai! Long live Tabrez bhai! Long live Tabrez bhai! - Enough! Enough! Long live Tabrez bhai! Long live Tabrez bhai! A dark government of dark deeds! The ministers of this government... ...have achieved major degrees... ...in corruption, bribery, cheating. The people have witnessed everything. The poor is being exploited as the unscrupulous garner notes. I raised my voice, I was arrested to be silenced. But the court of justice is not blind. No one can silence me. All allegations levied against me... ...are totally false and baseless. Now what'll become of ministers like Dinkar... ...Pandey in the court of people, that is yet to be seen. The public has lost faith in this government. We'll pull it down! Long live Tabrez bhai! Long live Tabrez bhai! Sir, what will be your next step? I'll demand an emergency meeting in... ...the Vidhan Sabha and a no confidence motion. But... Long live Tabrez Alam! Long live Tabrez Alam! The impossible happened but as pointless. Do what you want but you can never become a Minister. Mr. Pandey, everyone abandons a sinking ship. Face reality, your ship has sunk! That ship doesn't even exist. To pull down the government you need 122 MLA's! You've forgotten how to count. Go back to the cabinet meeting... ...from which you've excused yourself. Every minute the strings of your coalition are breaking. Mr. Pandey, your chair has slipped away from you, Forget about my chair. Now just see how the ground slips under your feet. I'm with him. Talk to him. It's Mr. Pandey. Wants to meet you urgently. Hello. - This is the time to support us openly. This is all Tabrez's conspiracy. He'll take full advantage of it. What do you think? - Mr. Pandey the time is not right. We should not meet now. - Ajay! - We'll talk later. The problem is that we have 17 MLA's and Dayashankar's 13. A total of 55 but we still can't form the Government. Tomorrow is Akash Ranjan's press conference. He'll do an amazing expose! Nothing will happen. Some resignations will save the government. Don't worry! The government will fall by tomorrow. Hello! - Hello Mr. Superintendent. The MLA himself is coming for a jail visit. - Okay! Please sit in the office. I will send for him. No! I have a special work and it is a special day. If you permit, I'll go myself. You may proceed, sir! Hello sir! Keep it on. I'm coming. Come! Happy Birthday! How do you know? Dear, I know you better than myself. See what I've got. Get it! Why? What happened? After mother died, I never got a birthday gift! What is the matter, sir? Nothing! You must've heard of the brewing political storm! It wants to pull down the government. W may miss the opportunity again. Can nothing be done, bhai? There's something only you can do. Command me, I will do anything. Sir! This is the list of Tabrez Alam's phone calls today. 2289703 is the jail number. - Sir. Get the details. Do you have a man there? - Yes sir. Greetings sir. - Greetings Ajay bhai! There wasn't any plan to go out. Where are you going? Tabrez bhai's work came up suddenly. Ajay that... What is the matter? Aren't you coming? Mr. Pandey had called. It's urgent. He's asking about you. If you say then... - No! You work for Pandey. I can't refuse Tabrez bhai. I will fix your meeting whenever... - Go! Hello Mr. Khan! - Hello. Ajay Shastri's replacement. How long will you take to return, Ajay bhai? If I return it'll be 3-4 hours. We will wait for you at the hospital. Reach there directly. You? - Tabrez bhai has asked me to go with you. He knows I always work alone. Bhai, he has left alone. - Keep an eye on him. - Yes bhai! Sit in the car! Hello. - Usman had called. - Bhai, don't you trust me? I do trust you. I'm worried about your life not the assignment. After you are done with the job as... ...you come out you'll find a red van at the rear gate. Slip out in that. Understood? Do as I say. Sir, from Tabrez Alam's phone there is a call to a new number? What's the number? - 09563799880 I'll call that new number now. Track the area in which the phone is. - Yes sir. Sir, it'll take some time to locate. Hurry up! Urgent! - Okay sir. Sign here. - Your card. - Thanks Is the Education Minister involved? Everyone's involved. It'll expose everyone! I think the Government will fall. - No one can save it. Mister, your phone's ringing. Don't disconnect. Please hear me out. I am Khan... Anwar Khan. I was the SP at Salampur. What you're doing is not only wrong but also dangerous for you. We've our entire record. Tabrez Alam's planned to kill Akash... ...Ranjan and blame the government. Because of which there'll be an... ...outcry and the government will fall. But just think will you be saved? You don't know Tabrez Alam. He lacks humanity. He incites and misleads people in the name of God. You've fallen prey to his barbarism. Ajay, only I can save you. Don't disconnect. Talk to me. I'll... Where is Mr. Akash Ranjan? He'll come to the hall in a sometime. You? Where is Akash Ranjan? Why? Akash Ranjan. This press conference... Oh! You want to kill Akash Ranjan... ...and stop this press conference? But you will never succeed in this despicable mission! I'm not here to listen to your lecture. That's obvious! I can see your motive. What else can losers like you, who... ...can't face the truths of life, do? Sir, does this seem like the sign of failure? You can't imagine the extent of our success and power. We can even topple the Government! You know your acclaim and achievements are hollow. You've chosen the path of terror and violence. The end will be terrifying. Thanks for your well wishes from my end. I am a blot on your struggle, principles, saintly stature. It's written on my forehead. 'My father is ashamed of me! ' You blame me... - Yes, you're responsible for all this. Completely! What have you done for me? Mother passed away. You were never there for me. I've done everything on my own. But you purposely obstructed my path. Because you hated me! I regret that because of me you have experienced only failure. Today you have an opportunity. Akash Ranjan is not behind this corruption expose, I am. This was to be revealed in today's press conference. Kill me and your mission will definitely succeed. Which father won't rejoice at his son's success? Professor Shastri! - Mr. Shastri! Please open the door! Professor Shastri! - Mr. Shastri! Please open the door! Let's break the door! Did Ajay come here? He was here, but he's gone. Bhai! Ajay has left the Media Centre. He didn't come into our car. Is the work done? No bhai! The reporter is in front of me. Khan and Ajay's father are with him too. Okay! All of you leave from there. Are all the gates locked? - Yes sir. What to do Ajay bhai? You know the game. Hey, keep your hand up! Start the car! Hello! - Where do you want to meet? I, Ajay Shastri, son of Raghuvansh Shastri, district Salampur. In my senses, without being pressurized... ...willingly confess to the police. There are 47 kidnapping, murder... ...and extortion cases against me. I don't remember the date but after kidnapping Soorjamal I... ...took him in the dickey of my car to Tabrez Alam's house. He was angry that I had murdered Gaya Singh. After I justified my deed, I joined the gang. On his orders on 12th October we... ...kidnapped Dr. Ved Prakash from the hospital. Tabrez Alam's brother, Usman, collected the ransom. I got one lakh for this job. From where you used to get the money and manpower? There's a storeroom of weapons at Tabrez Alam's house. Usman also keeps weapons with... ...a lot of people around Salampur. I know those people and places well. You are signing your death warrant. If you want, you can still withdraw. Wish I could! After this confession, you'll be in our custody. Trust us. Till you're here, you'll be safe. You're getting late. Carry on. Tabrez Alam will be arrested but it's a sensitive matter. I'll speak to the Minister. We may lose this opportunity. Please! Fine! You keep an eye on Tabrez's... ...house and wait for my call. I'll go to the Ministry myself. - Please sir! Good work, Khan! Long live Tabrez Alam! Long live Tabrez Alam! Dinkar it is late now. I am willing to leave the Home Ministry. - That won't be enough. Your supporting party's deserting you. You can't blackmail me with just 35 MLAs. What about the CBI inquiry? Take the moral responsibility and resign. I'll think about you. Write I, Dinkar Pandey, am hereby resigning from... Hello sir. - Hello. Sir, Ajay Shastri is in our custody. He's made a statement against Tabrez Alam. We can arrest him now. According to your CID' report how... ...many MLA's are supporting Tabrez? Including Daya Shankar's group, it is 55. 55, and mine is 35. You've done a great job. Leave this file here. It's a sensitive matter. I'll speak to the Chief Minister. Sir... - Don't worry. You'll get your reward soon. - Sir Bhai, Pandey's called! Yes, Mr. Pandey! Your boy's in our custody. And he's exposed you totally in his confession. So you want to make a deal! Obviously! The conspiracy to murder a reporter... ...and pull down the Government. You won't be able to prove anything. I know! But at least I can put you in jail. Tabrez bhai, no one will benefit from this battle. What is the price of saving you from this political mess? We'll make you a minister. Name the chair and it's yours! What's the matter? Isn't sir back? - Sir is sitting inside. Sir, he left right in front of me I kept calling you. Relax Khan! Nothing can be done now. The political turmoil in the state has taken a new turn. MLA Tabrez Alam came with his 55 supporters. And he has withdrawn the no confidence motion conditions. He's now supporting Dinkar Pandey. So the Home Minister who was... ...resigning now has around 100 supporters. We've heard that Tabrez Alam's joining the government. He's sure to be a Minister now. Long live Dinkar Pandey! Long live Tabrez Alam! Sorry! In spite of your huge sacrifice, we lost. Your life is in danger! You can escape if you want. I've run enough! No more! Anyway in my business you can't run. How shall I help you? Just do one thing for me. By five thirty in the morning I'll pick you up. Son! - Father, you? - Son, I was missing you. You took so long father. Never before... I made a mistake son. I am still suffering. But what should I do father? What punishment will undo all that I've done? And start with a clean state, father. If you had made me realize once... ...then I wouldn't have gone so far. Now what can I do? I've caused you such pain! I've become an unworthy son! No, I wasn't worthy of you! I look too long to understand you. I thought, one day I'd succeed and do you proud. But I kept sinking deeper into hell! It doesn't matter. I am proud of who you are. And listen son, don't repent. Instead do something to atone for what you did. I will. I'll atone for my deeds. Father, you please forgive me! It's a little cold. I hereby solemnly pledge that I will have full... ...respect for and faith in the Indian Constitution. I will protect the greatness and solidarity of my country. I shall respectfully fulfil all the duties... ...of the post I am accepting. Good morning sir! What a pleasant surprise! How did the media know that I was coming? Did you invite them? - No sir! Get them out! People like you don't learn. Where have you kept him? Open the door. - Sir. Open! It really hurts me to see tears in your eyes. Are you scared? But you were very brave! What did you say the first time you met me? 'Tabrez bhai, I can give my life for you and take lives too.' And I, trusted you like a son, opened all doors for you. I treated you like an equal but you! Not only did you betray your father and me but also yourself. How will face your self? Take. Have some sweets. I've become a minister, thanks to you. If you hadn't betrayed me, I wouldn't... ...support that scheming Pandey. You've given me the Home Minister's chair. Eat! You took a fancy to Pandey! What could he do for you that I couldn't? He'd make you win the Motipur election? And all I'd give you was humiliation and insults? How will you understand? My brother Usman, whose son we sacrificed for our ideals. I gave you a place higher than him! What answer shall I give Him? I made a mistake. I'll rectify it. It's your good fortune and my misfortune... ...that I am the Home Minister. And I cannot kill you today. But tomorrow, you will have to go! You just have time till tomorrow. Tabrez bhai! I didn't have time till tomorrow! Bhai! Bhai! Sign here.
