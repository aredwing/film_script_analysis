Leah, open the door. - Okay, sorry, I was having a shower. - That would be awesome if it were true. - Sleep well? - Yeah. - Planning on taking a shower today? - I did, see. - Don't forget to eat something, Leah. - Don't forget to eat. Don't forget to shower. Anything else? - Yeah, Dr. parson's coming over today? - Yeah, probably. I doubt the break cords I cut on her car will stop her for long. She's pretty persistent. - How's the drawing coming? - It's not. - Well, you keep trying it'll come back. - You should wear your Navy one. - This doesn't go? - No. - Thank you. - Toby, will you get that? - One, two, three. - You're all right. You're okay. - I'm really sorry. I tried. I'm really sorry. - It's okay. You tried, angel, you tried. - Okay. - Hello Brendan, may I? - Yeah. - Thank you. - - Come on in. I'm sorry I'm sorry you had to come all the way day here but I really just need more time to think about this. - Oh, it's not a good time? - Yeah. - - Okay. - It's not a good time. - I understand leave you with this. - Oh, good. - If you have any questions, I'll show you what we have in mind. Yeah, okay. - Thanks for coming all the way down here. - Yeah, no problem. - Who was that? - Just a salesman. Hey look it's Sabrina again. - Just hit decline. - Well, you know she's just worried about you, right? - Yeah, I know I'm just not ready for friends. - Okay. Hey, you ready? - Yeah, dad - yeah, son? - Any chance I could borrow 50 bucks? - Now by borrow I'm assuming you mean give. - I'll pay you back someday. - That's reassuring what's it for? - Well, the guys and I finally got a gig at the bar on queen I was telling you about and the only way they'll let us play is if we cover the pa rental. - Why are you having to pay to entertain a bunch of bar patrons? In case you didn't know usually it's the other way around. - We got to go. - - Dad, just let him have it. - Let me handle it, honey. - Mom, stop, mom. It's beautiful. - Oh, no, it ain't. That's what he wants you to think. It's garbage. It's garbage. - Ow. - So have you thought about what we discussed last time? Well, what if we were to go out on the porch just say for 30 seconds? - I'm really not in the mood to fail today so... - Why do you assume you'll fail? - 'Cause I know me I'm just gonna freak out like I always do. - What are you scared of, Leah? - I don't want to give them more ammo to talk about me. - What do you think they're gonna talk about? - About what I did. - We've been over this. - Listen you weren't there okay so don't... - How's the medication? So the same. Well, let's give it a little longer. What about the cutting, anything new? - Happy? - It's my job to check, Leah. - It's been six months since since the hospital and nothing's changed. I haven't I haven't changed. - I know it's frustrating but if you don't want to end up back in the hospital you are going to have to make an effort to move forward. - Hello. Who's there? Dad. Toby. Mom. - Leave me alone. - Mom, mom, mom, what did you do? Mom, stop, mom. It's beautiful. You're killing yourself with that you know that, right? - Who cares? - I do. Please, please stop. - Give it back. Give it back. - Okay. - Hi, Leah, how was your day? How was your session with Dr. Parsons? That looks good thank you. Well, aren't you gonna join me? It's no fun eating by myself. So I wanted to tell you that I spoke with my ta mark after school today and I think he's gonna help me with this little project. - You mean the show and tell all with mom's art. - Okay. How did you know? - I read the proposal that creep gave you this morning. - That creep is Randall Toth and he's curating a group show about artists who have dealt with depression. And that's why he wants to use your mother's work. - Great, so now everyone can know what happened. - It's just an art show, Leah. - You know that's not how mom would see it. - Maybe, but I thought that it could be a great excuse to get both your work out into the world. - I'm sorry, my work? I might as well take out a full page out in the paper. Leah Garrison, depressed artist, irritating sympathies not welcome. - Leah, this isn't about anything other than celebrating talent and I think that you and your mother can be involved in that, that's all. - So that everyone can criticize my work. - Will you at least talk to Dr. Parsons about it? - I don't know. - All I'm asking is that you talk to her about it. - Can we just eat now and not talk? - Yeah, yeah. Good. - Sorry I can't cook like mom. - No, it's fine. - Don't treat me like an idiot. Shit. You know it and I know it. - Please honey talk to me, talk to me, honey. Honey, talk to me. I'm here for you, angel. - Don't call me that. - Please, Leah. Leah, please. - Please, please stop. - Give it back. Give it back. Angel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... - You know what I can't take this anymore. You wanna kill yourself go ahead. We'd be better off without you. - Do it. - Shut up. - Do it. - Stop. - See you, Toby. - See you tomorrow. - Later t. - Dad, you hear that? It's crazy. You should've came downstairs. I think we really found our sound. - Yeah, I'm pretty sure I found it too. - I'm just saying it'd be nice if came and listen in the same room sometime. - Next time, buddy. - Let me guess the wrath of Leah. - She's had a tough time. - I'm aware we all have. - And everyone deals with things differently. That's why I need you to be patient with her. - Look I'm trying. But sooner or later she's gonna have to suck it up and join the land of the living again. - She's doing her best. - No, no she's not. And I'm sick of it. I'm sick of you babying her 'cause I'm a part of this family too you know. - Not everything has to be about you. - Apparently nothing does 'cause Leah she's your she's your little angel, right? And that nothing else matters, right? - Toby, we'll talk about this later. He didn't mean that. - Yeah, he did. I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm really trying. - I know you are, I know. - I can do that. - Okay. - Okay. What are you doing please don't touch that. - No, it's all right, honey. I'm just sending Mr. Toth some of your mom's paintings so he can pick what he wants for the show. - Can you just take a picture and email it, please? - Honey, no he really wants to study the original. - Okay, I don't care what he wants he can't have this one. - Honey, it's all right we'll - get it back. - - Dad, please can you just give it to me, dad? Look what you made me do. - I didn't. - Okay, just let me have it. - I'm so sorry. Leah, I didn't realize that it meant so much to you. - Where's Toby isn't he supposed to go with you? - Yeah, he's not going to school today. I think he's got a fever. - God, my ass. He probably just has a project or a test or something he doesn't wanna do. - Well, look I don't have time to get into this with you right now. He's sick. - Are you seriously buying this? - Please just check on him later? My ta mark is coming by to pick these up later so... - Dad, can't you just take them to school and give them to him? - No, no, I'm in class all day, all right. Please, I'd really appreciate it. - I know, dad, I'm not ready for that. Look, if you wanna be a part of this stupid art show that's fine. I don't wanna be involved. - Okay Leah, I don't ask for much, all right. I need your help it's important. Please, can you do this for me? - Okay, I'll try. - Thank you. Thank you that's all I'm asking. Okay. I'm just gonna leave these by the door, all right. - Oh my god I knew it. You are such a little con artist. - Whatever, Leah, move out of the way. - Where are you going? - Not to school if that's what you're asking. - You can't just skip school, Toby. - Watch me. - Jesus. - You know everyone has to tippy toe around you like you're the only one that matters around here. - That's not true. - - Then turn around and act like a total bitch to everyone else. I mean you've cut out all your friends, me. I mean we used to look out for one another. Now... What? - Nothing. Look, you can't just skip school, Toby. I'm gonna call dad. - You're going to rat me out? - Yeah. - Sure, go ahead. It's not like dad will care. He barely knows I exist anymore. - Yeah, he's gonna ground you for like a week. - I don't give a shit. - Okay, good. - Well, this is bullshit. You're bullshit. Guess I gotta be a suicidal nut job to get noticed around here. - Don't ever talk to me again. - Leah. - Shit. Far away in another world there lived a little doll named Alyra. She longed to be a great singer of songs. Alyra was created by the powers of Calah, a beautiful good witch who gave her not only the gift of life but also the gift of song. Unfortunately Calah was too curious for her own good. She liked to experiment with forbidden potions and spells. Alyra tried to stop her but Calah was too strong for the little rag doll. Blaming herself Alyra ran into the wild banishing herself from the world she once loved so much. But she was stalked by a troll witch doctor who wanted her to atone for her sins. She made songs of her lonely tears not realizing that her voice was heard by a roaming spirit known as the dark stranger. He had been watching her for a long time patiently waiting for her talent to blossom. He finally found Alyra alone and shivering in the forest. The stranger promised to take her to a place where her voice, her music would always be appreciated. Oh, my god. Toby, someone's at the door. Toby. - Hi, hello. Hi, I'm mark professor Garrison sent me over. Leah. Leah, your dad your dad told me to come over to pick up some paintings. He said you'd be expecting me. - Can you can you just give me just a second please? - You know I can come back later if you're busy. Were you drawing? - How do you know I draw? - Well, you have a very proud father. He told me all about your work. It sounds fantastic. You know I used to wanna draw like Dave Mckean. - You like Dave Mckean? - Yeah, yeah, he's pretty brilliant. Sandman is one of my all time favorites. - You like sandman? - Uh, like it was my go-to escape whenever I needed one you know. - Yeah, I do. Look, I have kind of a nasty cold. Do you think maybe you could go stand on the sidewalk and I'll just put it on the porch for you? - Should I avert my gaze as well? - That's probably a good idea, yeah. - Okay, yeah, sure. - Okay. Okay. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Nice to meet you. - Remember I like mine well done. - You wanna wear it on your head? - Is that a smile? You smiling? Where did this come from? - Nowhere in particular I just had a good day. I had a really good day. - That's fantastic, that's wonderful. That makes me so very happy. - Oh, hey, your ta came by to pick up the paintings. - I know thank you. I know that wasn't easy for you and I really appreciate it. That means a lot to me. - Hey, what do you know about this Randall Toth guy who's running the show? - Not much but he seems legit. - Yeah. The guy's gotta be kind of tortured himself if he wants to see a show about depressed artists. What's his deal? - Well, I'll find out more tomorrow. - What does that mean? - Well, I'm a meet him. We're gonna talk about the exhibit more and I'm hoping you'll reconsider being part of it. Hey, well you're looking better. Where have you been? - It must've been a 12 hour bug. I ended up going to school right after you left. No, seriously, I went. Look, I was late but I made it in time for second period. Leah made me go this morning. - Is this true? - Yeah. - Then this is a good day. You need a hand with dinner? - No, it's okay. You go relax. - Hey, for what it's worth thank you. - Honey, you all right? What happened? - He's under my bed. - See nothing under the bed. - What? - Hey, some new stuff. - Oh, no, no, no. I'm just sketching. - Yeah. All right if you need anything I'm just down the hall. - Hey dad am I turning into mom? - Your mother had some serious issues. You just need time to work through this and you'll beat this I know it. You sleep well, angel. - Alyra couldn't wait for the dark stranger to take her from this lonely place to where she would always be happy. On the journey she asked why he was called the dark stranger? He said the world didn't appreciate his talent so he found a new life in the shadows. He chose the end of the world to build his very own sanctuary a carnival full of spinning rides and colored lights. The dark stranger promised to make Alyra his star attraction where many would come in adoration. However the beauty of her voice invoked anything but adoration. Instead they began to heckle her trying to silence her. Then their hostility turned deadly. Just a second. - You seem happy today. - Yeah. I think I had a breakthrough. I'm working on a new graphic novel. - That's wonderful, Leah. So this must mean that you're adjusting to the new medication. - Yeah, I guess so. I haven't felt this good in a really long time. - So can I ask what is this story that you're drawing about? - It's kind of hard to explain. This character the dark stranger it's like he created himself to lead me. - Where is he leading you? - Well, I don't know but it's gotta be better than here. - I'd really like to take a look at these drawings if I may. - They're not really ready to show so... - I promise I won't be critical. I'm just curious is all. They're really beautiful, Leah. What is this? It looks like blood? - Oh, no, no, it's a new just a new India ink pigment. I really like the look that it gives. - Is this supposed to be me? Well, it's actually a pretty good likeness. You know I'd really like to read this whole story from the beginning. - Why? - Because I think it will give me some insight into where you are creatively and I can see if there's a link to the work that we're doing together. - No, you and dad have been on me to start drawing again and you wanna take it away? - No, I'm not asking you not to do your art, Leah. I just I just wanna be sure that it's not taking you to a bad space is all. - Okay. - Okay, good. You'll have them all back at our next session. - Yeah, okay. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Nobody answered when I knocked. - What are you doing here? - Mr. Toth asked me to return your mother's paintings. - You can just leave them on the porch. - All right but are you still sick? - Why? - Because could I come in just for a few minutes just to charge my phone. Because if your dad calls and he can't get in touch me, I know he's going to kill me. - I don't know. I don't know. You might wanna invest in a car charger. - Yeah, yeah. I know I actually had one but last week my car got broken into and the a-holes they stole it so I've been meaning to get a new one ever since. - Does this mean Mr. Toth doesn't like my mom's work? - I'm not sure. He did ask though if those were the last paintings she did before before she died. - Why? - He didn't say. - Okay well no they're not. - Okay. He didn't think so. Can I can I take the last one she did to show him? - No, the frame's cracked. I'm gonna get it fixed but it won't be done in time for the show. - Yeah, okay, okay. Okay, I'm at 5% right now so I'll just wait til I get to like 10% and then I'll be out of your hair, okay? - I really like your jacket. - Oh, thanks, thanks. Yeah, I got it in Kensington market right next to this coffee place. - Hannah's beanery. - Yeah, you know it? - Yeah, I basically lived there when I was in arts school. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, me too. You know we were probably there at the same time and had no idea. - Do you draw? - Uh, ish. I mean I try but I know where my strengths are which is studying art history rather than attempting to be a part of it in any way whatsoever. Unlike you. - Oh, no, I mean I draw but no one's making history here. - It's not what I hear. - Well, my dad is very good at playing the dotting father and in case you haven't noticed he's a little bit of a. - Well, I'd love to take a look at your work sometime. - Oh, I mean I am working on something but it's not ready to show especially to a professional critique. - If and when you're ready I'd love to take a look and I promise that I won't bite. Okay, okay I'm at 15% so that should do it so I'm sorry for the intrusion. - No. - It was really nice chatting with you, Leah. So don't be a stranger. - Okay. Poor Alyra didn't stand a chance against these vicious creatures. Their hatred of her voice was too much for her to stand up to. But faith intervened when she was rescued by a heroic goblin named Meric. Meric was a little bit of light in her dark world. He made her feel like she didn't have to prove to anyone that her voice was beautiful it just was. The dark stranger seethed with jealousy accusing Alyra of neglecting him. He warned her that Meric was a false friend no different from the creatures who attacked her. They were all envious of her talent. The stranger told her to trust only in him because he thought her voice was the most beautiful he had ever heard. He vowed that no one would come between them again. What am I doing? What time is he coming over? - Mr. Toth he should be here any minute. Which reminds me he and I are having dinner tomorrow night so you both are on your own. - It sounds like you two are going steady. - You know what, Toby, you should really think about leaving the whole musician thing and going into comedy. You're such a natural. - I get all my humor from you, dad. - Okay, sorry I don't understand why you and Mr. Toth have to meet so much. What else does he want to know? - He just wants to chat about your mom find out who she was as an artist. Any chance you wanna join us? We could stay right here. - Oh, yeah, thanks for the invite, dad. I know it would mean so much to you for me to be there but I really don't have the time. I really have to wash my hair. - What is that really necessary? I didn't think you'd be interested in coming to an artist's meeting. - Is mark gonna be there? - Well, he can if it'll sway you. That must be my date. - Good to see you, Brendan. - Hey Mr. Toth. - Am I early? - No, you're fine. Come on in, Mr. Toth. I'm just gonna get my coat. - You must be Leah. It's very nice to meet ya. - You look familiar. - Oh, do I why is that do you think? - I guess you just look like somebody that I know. - And who might that be? - I don't remember. - Okay, Mr. Toth, there's a nice cafe up the street. - You know sometimes strangers can seem familiar. Shall we? - Shit. Shit, shit. - Leah. - Who's there? - Be with us, Leah. - Join us, Leah. - Dead with us, Leah. - Who's there? Mom. - Oh, angel don't give him what he wants. - What are you talking about? - The dark stranger. - Mom, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I made you... - Kill yourself. - Leah, Leah, Leah Leah, for godsakes calm down. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, honey, what happened? What happened? - Toth, Mr. Toth Mr. Toth was here he was here. - Mr. Toth why would Mr. Toth be here? - Where's the coffee? I thought we had a full bag? - Why don't we try some decaf this morning, give all that caffeine a break? - That's what you think's going on I'm not getting enough sleep? - I don't know what it is but I think you need to try and start taking care of yourself. - Why? My symptoms don't match anything. I'm a lost cause. - No, no, you're not a lost cause. You're under a lot of stress. You're not eating well. You're not sleeping. How else would you explain what you saw in the laundry room? I think you're afraid of Randall Toth and what his art show represents. - That's not it. - It reminds you what happened with mom. - It's gonna happen to me. - No, it's not true you hear me? Because I won't let it you here me? I won't let it. - Oh, oh, god. No, no, no, no shit. - Leah. - Leah. - Okay you want me to draw I'll draw. It was time to Alyra's big debut. As the rag doll sang to an enraptured crowd a vision appeared. It was Calah. With her spirit returned to its pure form she had come to reveal the true nature of the dark stranger. She told Alyra that he was using her talent to make himself stronger. When he was finished with her she would be another addition to his collection of death. Calah then produced a magical crystal orb that revealed to Alyra a wizard named Telvin who had been hunting the stranger for years. She would find her answers with him. Alyra only had time to see a gold ring with a red gemstone on Telvin's hand before Calah vanished. Frightened by this revelation Alyra and Meric ventured out to find the bearer of this ring. Enraged the dark stranger unleashed a plague of death to stop anyone who dared help her. - Leah, you in there? Did you read the paper? Jesus. Come one. Come on, come one. Come on dad pick up. - Hey, hipstamatic can you not leave your stuff lying around? Are you even in there? Toby. Spiffy. - Well, I wanted to make an impression on Mr. Toth. - Yeah, right. - Thanks. Are you okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah, I just I get a really bad feeling from this Toth guy. I mean he comes in out of nowhere and he wants to know all about my mom. It gives me the creeps. - Well, not everyone can be as naturally charming as you, Ms. Garrison. I don't know as far as I can tell, I think he seems harmless. - I don't know. I don't trust him. I haven't trusted him since the moment I saw him. - How come? - Okay. You're going to think that I'm way weirder than you already do. - That's not possible. - Oh, good. - Seriously, did he did he say something to you or something? - Oh, no, no, no, no nothing like that. He just I've been working on a new story and somehow he made his way into the drawing. - Well, he made an impression on you and artists they take inspiration from you know the world they live in all the time. - Yeah, that's not it. - Ouch, how'd that happen? - Oh, it was an accident. - Was this an accident too? - Hey, hey. Look it's complicated. - Try me. - It's also none of your business. - Leah, I know I know that your mom thought that she had to drink to paint but you don't need to do the same thing with cutting. - My god, I can't believe he told you. Of course, of course he told you. - He's just worried about you. - Did he tell you what happened to my mom? Did he tell you it's my fault? - That you blamed yourself but that you shouldn't. - Okay, well, neither of you were there so you have no idea how much blame I should or shouldn't take. - Leah, you need to see that you're not at fault here, okay? - How do you know? - I can tell. You're not. - Yeah, just right this way. Hey, well, well, well the gang's all here. I just invited Mr. Toth in for some tea. Either of you wanna join us? - Hello. - Leah, Randall was hoping he could ask you a few questions about your art. - I'm sorry. - I understand. - Hey, don't touch me. - Leah. - Telvin. How could this be? Were the wizard Telvin and the dark stranger one in the same? Alyra wanted to flee but she looked deep into Telvin's eyes. Instead of the dark stranger's heartless gaze she found only kindness and truth there. Telvin warned her that no one had ever escaped from the dark stranger until he got what he wanted which was to crush and consume your spirit. Feeling trapped Alyra considered never using her beautiful voice again since that was what drew the dark stranger to her. The wizard assured her that wasn't necessary. "The key to defeating him", Telvin said "wasn't by giving up "but by taking control of her voice "and using it to her advantage." The doll wasn't sure if she had the courage to do this. Nevertheless the wizard insisted that he could see great strength within her. But until she learned to use it the dark stranger would destroy anything or anyone until she gave in. - Leah. - What oh my god, Toby. - Hey, hey, are you okay? I thought I'd come up and see what you're doing. - How long have I been up here? - You've been up here a while. - Where's Mr. Toth? - He's downstairs with your dad. - Okay, mark, can you do me a really big favor please? - Okay. - Don't let him leave, don't let Mr. Toth leave the house. - Why, why, why is everything all right? - I don't know can you trust me? - Yeah, I trust you. - Okay. Toby. Toby. Where's Toby. - Give me what I want. - She's okay. Yeah, she said she'll be down in a minute. - Thanks for checking, mark. She'll be down in a minute. - Mom. Mom, I'm scared. I'm scared. I need you. - Oh, angel don't give him what he wants. - Well, Brendan, I guess we'll try this another time. - Please don't go she said she was coming right down. - We can reschedule. Leah's had a tough time since we... - Mr. Toth, Mr. Toth, Mr. Toth, do you know who this is? Please because I think he's got my brother. - Oh god, Leah, what are you talking about? - Dad, please just let him look. - Mr. Toth, my daughter is not well. Obviously this was a bad idea. - Dad please just let him look. Look. - Leah, I know who this is. - Mr. Toth please don't enable this. - I know everything about the stranger. I first contacted you after reading about your mother. Now, I used the cover at the art show to learn more about her. For some years now I've been following something that has been killing a lot of artists just like your mother. - The dark stranger. - Yeah, my father. - Your father. I thought this was just a character that Leah made up? - Well, that's what he'd like you to believe. My father was a terrific painter. He was renowned in the art world for years. Then fashions changed and well he couldn't sell a thing. And he felt completely abandoned. He was in a terrible rage all the time blaming these new artists for his failure. In despair he signed his last painting the dark stranger. - What the hell does this have to do with any of us? - For years after he died I kept hearing about more and more artist killing themselves. I wanna show you the final paintings of two of the suicides. - So. - Look closer. - It's him. - The stranger. - They're faked photographs anyone could've made those. - How do I destroy him? - There's no one to destroy, honey. They're fake. - Well let me tell ya what I've learned so far. The dark stranger is a spirit who infects artists that he's jealous of. He poisons their imagination like a virus. Now, I'm not sure how. I think he uses their blood as a way in. But once he starts corrupting an artist he makes the outside world seem their enemy. Then he compels you to abuse yourself until you're too weak to go on. As he gets stronger the stranger is able to come into the real world through your art or even pull you into the art with him. Finally when you're too weak to go on the stranger collects your soul through suicide. That's his power source. He can kill others who get in his way. But for the artist it must be by their own hand. The stranger always leaves his image on the creator's last work like a contract between them. That's why I wanted to see your mother's paintings to check for his likeness. - All right I've heard enough. The only person poisoning people's minds here is you. Now get out of my house. - No, dad, it's true. - No honey, he's manipulating... - Look, look, he's disappearing from the drawing. - He's heard everything we said. He's trying to come through. Quick we've gotta burn these. - Are you crazy - what are you doing? - - No, no, dad let him. Are you okay? Mr. Toth. - Leah, stay away from him. - He's coming into my blood. - Get your hands off of her. - You're gonna wish you killed yourself. - Dad. - Come on, come on. - No. - Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. - I can't. I can't. You go. - Not without you. My studio we can go to my studio. - Where are we? - It's my story. He brought us inside my story. I'm so sorry this has nothing to do with you. - Well, we're not gonna give up without a fight. - Your mother's soul tasted so sweet. You know your mother was a great artist. I had to work on her for years. It took me time breaking her down but finally I got her. - No. - And now I've got you. - You bastard. - Paint this. Still wanna play? - Mark. Mark, no. - Now, bachelor number two. - Toby, Toby. Toby, are you okay? - Leah. - Get off. - You know what you have to do finish your story end it or they die. - No, Leah, no, don't do it. - Don't listen to him. No one's gonna miss someone as pathetic as you. Take your life or I'll take theirs. - You win. - No, Leah. - Let them go. - Finish the drawing and I'll sign off on the ending. - Leah, don't do it.
