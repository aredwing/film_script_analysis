The first time. Eh... She was not sure of how doing it. For seven hours? We speak. I thought that you it realized well. You are right. I feel it, I ruined it. We go. A little warm. And without great sense. Put on them. Forward. Prove them to yourself. With your big bottom, I will not have left well. He remembers. It is your last opportunity, Ruby. Behave. Or I will become bad. Do not forget to use corset. It covers this injury until it goes away. Hello, Vincent. How does it go? Well. The man grows up to where they leave it. There is something that to learn in every thing that we do... ... and in every thing that they do to us. What have I learned? That to be addicts is essentially human. We all have an addictive nature. But we can justify... ... to ignore or to laugh at the majority of the addictions. That we have more serious addictions... ... we frown and look for below to those ... weaknesses... ... when privately, in our hearths... ... we lodge our own ones with hypocrisy... ... be already drugs, money... ... sex. My addiction... ... it is... ... what is. Truth. Yes, miss. Have a short rest in this couch. This way, miss? It wants to drain the blood... It wants to drain the blood of me body without value, miss? Miss? Have a short rest, useless pig! Open these cheeks! I will give you something that not you have had from the school... ... bad-mannered child. Miss. For God! Awake, awake, small Ruby. You have disappointed me. You disappointed me. You are like an investment as which it goes badly. The favorite... ... that falls down to the last thing. Good, this night... ... it is time to return your investments... ... even if I have to support your open well legs. I will straighten her up, chief. You always liked this. Always the fighter. Good, we go. Do it. Give him your best shot. We go. You can make it better, a sweetheart. Do you remember the slap that is distant to me? He thinks that it was something like that. We go! Show me the hard thing that you are. I love the pain. I love it. Excite me. We go. Provoke me an erection. The hoary man knew that had turned me. But it had more reasons to die that I. I am hoping to die... ... to be with my love again. It has spent so much time. I know what you are... ... even if you not. It bites. It bites. And this way a sacrifice was consolidated. I gave him my life. He gave to me his. My first meal. My last friend. This way it were where everything began. Whenever I keep on living... ... I remember it. ... to whisper... First you, eh? Nightmares? You will get accustomed. What have you done to me? Consider it as that you have developed a blood need. An addiction. But ... my neck ... and your doll. Our white globules they work ten times more rapid. Are we immortal? Not. Skylight that not. And the holy water is not burning hot our meat. Only it wets us. And the garlic does not do anything to us, only that our breath infects with the plague. And the sun? For some reason, now I am allergic in view of the sun. It does that my skin toasts... ... and I stung myself. Something like eczema, I suppose. A stake in the heart? Yes. That would kill us. But also a bullet in the head. Relax, Ruby. You have turned now... ... and you have to feed... ... every day. A stripper. Bitch! It raises damned that one stage and move! Here you have, friend... a toy wetted to fuck. Every hole is an attempt. Scallop, bottom, mouth. Even his ears. I adjoin and slowly or last. He loves everything. You miss his mouth when you finish, he savours it and it it spits at the flat... ... saying, " Thank you, papi ", between every lick. She is a small prostitute she absorbs pricks, fucked, with enormous nipples, aggressive, submissive... ... I come up oppressive, that dances in his skirt and it is opened of legs. And the best thing: it is cheap! Again! You are mine! Mine! Your shift, love. Only I want to forget everything. Vaymonos of London. I need to do it. For us. Only he writes the direction. Then we will leave and we will begin of zero. I bet that this guy is crazy, Leroy. So allow me to say it to yourself directly. You come to my place and you make me anger... ... for a ballerina. You are crazy, man. Yes, you are crazy. Once I saw a documentary... on this type. Eh ... how is his name, Leroy? Timothy Carey. Timothy Carey. So this guy says that our farts... ... they break the wind... ... they cut the cheese... ... they are a bomb, or since you want to call it... ... for a reason. It is to liberate toxins... ... that of another form they would poison our bodies. It is true. And that every fart that ... we retain... ... it takes five minutes of life from us. Now, the people in the civilized society... ... it retains his farts ... for being polite. It is a fact. They are killing themselves slowly only to be polite. Also, this Greek doll... ... the type of the triangle, eh... - Pitgoras. - Pitgoras. Also he believed that we were losing something of our souls... ... with every blow of the ancient wind. So not only we are killing ourselves... ... but also sticking to our souls. Who wants a soul? You... ... you are... ... a fart. And I love you out of my bottom. So: what is what you want? You want that he promises you that I will leave them to you and to Ruby in peace... ... so that they have lives happy? This is what I want. What do you see, son? I see the guy that hurt our baby. I see the guy that hurt the sensual girl. Good, what bad luck. Vincent? That is for the sensual girl. That is for me. My direction. Ruby's letter is so bad as his taste for the men. It has gone away. You killed it. It did not have the intention. Only it happened. The things ... only they happen. This is for Ruby. So you throw them here. Yes. A small community that he rests at the bottom of the Thames. Do not speak this way. It is not pretty or sweet. It is horrible. Yes, I know it, but... ... what can do on this matter? Unless you want to leave a track of bodies that lie everywhere... ... so that the children are stumbled. He would be like a drug addict that throws his needles to the street. Are you ready? Why? For your first time. You must be joking. Only I tell jokes when the public is drunk. You can feel it... ... that one famine? You can hear it also: not? So ... you are here alone at this hour of the night. Something says to me that you have a history. Yes? What happens? Not at all, fondness. Not at all. Then: where is your husband? Probably fucking with one of his amiguitas. In the fifth flat. On his office, perhaps. I hope that he should be enjoy it. Do not worry, fondness. It does not hurt already so much. I already overcame it. Only I feel numb. Vincent, we go. I am so boring. So boring. I have forgotten of how feeling. Only I want to feel something. Any thing. Forgive, lady, but we must go away. Vincent. Ruby. Sultame. You might kill me if you take too much. I feel it. I will not be the addicted one, Vincent. I it will not be. I feel what it spent to you then. But this is different. We do not want this. We need it. As the oxygen. We need the blood. How do you know it? Have you tried to leave it? You are an addict. Instead of to the heroine, to the blood, that is quite. I will leave it. Only you are spending an evil moment with the nightmares. You will get accustomed to them. I have already done it. I will leave it. And I want that you do it with me. So we enter a pharmacy. I went to the deposit... ... and I found Valium and other drugs that are given to the persons... ... so that they overcome his addictions. These are the drugs accepted by the society... ... to that we can be addicts. Of a form or other one, we needed something... ... to liberate us of the quakes and pains in the future nights. This had already made earlier. Vincent: fondness? Yes, Ruby, baby? How did they turn you? What? I speak seriously. I want to know it. Was it pretty? How do you know that she was a woman? Was she a woman? Yes. She was a woman. He did not know her. It was... It was drunk in a bar of Soho. He was meeting some persons, but I cannot remember whom. I cannot remember anything of my life before this night. But I remember this jezabel that nothing appeared of. What happened later? I do not know it. The only thing that I remember, the fact is that I was crawling... ... for the alley of nearby. It was much... ... sexy. And then? And then... Then it ruined my life. Vincent. I love you. Vincent? Might you to be this one, Ruby? Attempt to feed of those without dear or dependent beings or those whom they will not miss. Sometimes we cannot be selective. I know what I am. I know what I have to do. And I do it. I feel it. Vincent? Vincent? Not! Vincent? What happens to you? It was afraid. What... For God. I can smell it. I can smell it in you! Do not say anything. Do not say anything! Damned liar! You cannot flee of what you are. This is not what I am! This is into what you turned me! You! I feel it. Good, you should feel it. You have ruined my life! As they ruined yours. You are not better than she. Not, that is not just. Then: what is just, Vincent? Is it just what you did to me? It is just that I am trying it so much and have you done this? I do not know what to say to you. It is what I am! Ruby! Hello, it surprises. How does it you go this night? You again. It does not worry your mother what do you walk on the street so late? To my mother a carajo does not worry him. I can look after only. So ... how is your fianc? It is well, thank you. Yes? You see, he does not like: what? Not, not, not. It becomes the difficult one. You know how it is. It cheated you. Say to him what you said to me bring over from yesterday until the night. Yes, yes, yesterday to the night. I was in a trio of the strangest thing. Two warm sluts. It could not stop them. They loved what the man it had for them. Do you want a little, also, fondness? They gave me affectionate bites. You like the bites affectionate, fondness? We go, it continues. Enter! Vyanse. Hear! Tongue calientapijas! You like playing with the men: yes? Or you want... Leave me alone! I warn them! Do you warn it to us? Veto the carajo! We go! We go! Carajo! Tongue... We go! You are intoxicated: not, me... ... bomboncito? You are sweet. But perhaps your mother did not teach you what is better not to be a prostitute? You like becoming the difficult one: not, bitch? This is what you gain now... ... that we play at making to ourselves the difficult ones. You will be third this night! Do you believe in God? I believe that it exists. Of some or another form He intervenes... ... I do not believe it. I believe in God. I believe that he observes everything what we do. I want to be a good person. Am I a good person? The good thing and the bad thing does not exist. Only gray in the way. Now... ... in your arms... ... I feel myself more safe than never. I will not trump you again, Ruby. Do you promise it? I promise it. It does a pair of years, I met another addict. He said that he was looking for a woman to that he had listened to speak. He said that he could treat our addictions. Something medical. A priest. Where is it? In some place in Edinburgh, it is everything what I know. It did not have a reason then like now. I will look for some provisions before going away. Valium. Money for the gasoline. I will not feed again, Vincent. It is not important for me what it happens. I feel that I die. You are not dying. Do you promise it? I am not afraid to the death. To a lost life only. If for any reason I do not return... ... I want that you go and find this woman... ... search this remedy. It is well. And do not throw my body to the Thames. Yes? Perhaps in the Sea of the North or in the Atlantic Ocean. Not in the damned Thames. Crikey. We had to divide in this moment... ... or to wait to the next night. It is a trip of 8 hours to Edinburgh. And 8 hours and a half were absent for the dawn. Why do not we divide directly? I do not know it. Why does an addict do what it does? As he said Of Niro once... " Your brain turns into pure ". Not. We need provisions. I will not eat. I will not disappear. But if I do not return... ... fondness, sees and find her alone. You know that I am a liar... ... the tricky one... ... and an addict. Do not go. But if I return, then you will know that... ... I love you more than to nobody. Please do not leave me. We need these provisions. If not, we will not achieve it. I will not leave you. I will go for you. How are you, Vincent? We go. Here. Allow me to help. God, you are absolutely... We go, Vincent. We go. You must help me a little. You are very heavy. We go. I can do it only. It was trying to help you. Yes, good... ... get into your things. Go out of here. Vincent, there is no need of being rough with me. I feel it. I did not want to be rough. Adivine adnde I will go now, gentleman. I will visit Ruby. Do you believe that it will be glad to see me? Do you believe that he will receive from me little? Veto the carajo. It is sure that I will find a form of obtaining a regalito. Not... "Not": what? Do not I fuck with her? Do not I violate it? Do not I kill her? Or perhaps do three things. Now, do not hope to see her again. What? Do you want more? Yes. - Hello. - Hello. Hello? Do not worry, mother. I was wrong of door. Does he forgive? I said that there was no problem, idiotic old woman. I was wrong of door. I was wrong of door, sick and flatulent old woman. Duncan! Are you? Yes. Yes, I will be Duncan. Listening, I will say to you what I will do. I will disappear a little bit, and when it returns... ... you and I will amuse ourselves... ... and I will fuck well with you. You were lucky of that someone it will call to an ambulance. Hello. Neighbor. He forgives. Mistaken. Mistaken? - Seriously do you live here? - Do not believe me? Not. I will call the police. Leave me alone! He forgives. Absorbing the sap of the life. We go, fondness. He attends. Please he attends. We go. Shit! Damned prostitute! Ruby. Is she Ruby? Allow me to enter! As he would say the wolf... ... small piglets, allow me to enter. Not, not for the hair of our barbillitas. Then I will breath heavily... ... and I will blow... ... and I will demolish the damned door. Not! Not, please, gentleman wolf! Veto the carajo. Dirty slut. It costs you... Is it difficult to you to breathe? Yes? Is it difficult to you to breathe? Good, do not worry... ... because ... very soon... ... you will not have to do it. Very soon you will not have to do it.

I feel it.... It cheated me. He thought that it was there for to spend a good moment, and... ... for the first time, someone loved me and he loved me very much. Animal magnetism: do you know? Good, the first thing that I did when I returned in me... ... it was to look for another alley... ... another slut... ... I bit and allowed bitting her before he was dying... ... and I kept on laughing, also. And I continued... only I kept on doing it. Hoping to find her again... ... to take revenge... ... to give to this slut something something of yes same, literally, you know. The first one was... ... it was the worst. It was difficult. But then it turned... ... more and easier... ... till now. Good, it is ... it is easy. I killed the slut three weeks ago. It was the seventh one. But it is ... it is like a waste time. You know already, once you get accustomed, to putting it so many times. That is to say, you will never be happy if only you masturbate... ... with vamosmistetas. com. Do you know?
