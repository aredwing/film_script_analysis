Can't I go to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major screwup? With all due respect, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at noon. Jesus Ch-- We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam. A covert military operation riddled with civilian scientists. You don't think it's that bad? Long spent the last two years developing his defoliant. The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet. - Where's their protective gear? - It's 100 degrees out here. The guys deserve a break. They'll get a break tomorrow. I'm not gonna take chances on our last day. Doc, what's up? I thought we wrapped the tests yesterday. Captain Brynner is gonna shit if he finds out we haven't closed up shop. I had something of an epiphany this morning, Telstar. I eliminated the binary shell, and I grafted the cobaltion to the other side of the molecule. I think it might give us a significantly more rapid chemical ignition. It better. Mr. Sweeney, how goes it? Well, Costello's finished with the stability profile... but Abbott is still chewing on the load file. So reaction temperature is 50 degrees. Your prediction was on the nose. How much longer for the range and power projections? I don't know. Uh, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe another hour. We don't have an hour. We're already supposed to be shut down. Dr. Long. What the hell's all this about a detonation today? We're scheduled to be off the island tonight. I changed the schedule. I don't work for you, Captain Brynner. Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation. You know, Captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your collar. This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long. You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsibility. Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay? If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine. I don't think I need to mention you could use the help. The N.S.A. thinks the U.N. is onto your work. The White House is screaming about chemical weapons, and we're sittin' here with our hands in the cookie jar. Let me tell you something else. I didn't join the service to let people like you... turn the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be-- But you have no choice but to follow orders. Now listen to me. I know you have moral objections to what we're doing here, but, believe me, if I thought there was any real danger, I wouldn't go forward. You have my word on that. All right. One more shot, provided we're off the island tonight. Let's proceed. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis is approaching the stage. Safe distance-- 200 yards. And make sure Hemmings hears you say it. Two hundred yards, Hemmings. D minus five. All right, we're movin' out, men. Hold it. Get closer together. Jesus. Dr. Long! I got 8,000 yards. Radius is five miles. - What? - Long, what the hell? Abbott's predicting the effective detonation radius is five miles. That's the entire island. We've gotta shut it down. We gotta shut it down. Oh, my God. "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." No! No! You'll kill us all! Damn you, Long. My people, your people are out there. It's too late. It's too late. Let me in! Captain Andrew Thomas Brynner, it is the opinion of this review panel... that the verdict delivered in this case is justified... and that you are, in fact, guilty of criminal negligence, resulting in the deaths of 18 members of a military research team... on the date of August 18, 1987. It is also this panel's opinion that the sentence of reduction in rank, for feiture of all pay and allowances... and ten years in the United States disciplinary command at Fort Leavenworth... is justified. Furthermore, you are advised that while you are a prisoner, you remain bound by the National Security Act of 1947. If you divulge classified information... or discuss the nature of the project in which you were involved, you will face further prosecution. Do you understand? I assume your silence indicates assent. Transfer to Leavenworth will be immediate. You're dismissed. Andrew, I wish they would've let me say something about-- There's nothing to say, Doctor. Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you said. So I'll be locked safely away in some hole along with my secret sins. And yours. Ready? - Been tryin' to figure out your secret. - My secret? Yeah. Ten months, we've been fishing this river together. We use the same equipment but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do. And I'm good at this, been doin' it since I was a kid. But you, I don't know. Somehow you think like a fish. No, that's not possible, Mason. The trout... is a perfect hunter, the master of his realm. How can we ever hope to win against the trout? There's only one way you can do it, Mason: Turn the power of the hunter against him. Tie a fly, create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive, forcing him to strike, and only then... does our noble friend realize that the prey can bite back. And that power, without caution, is death. Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot into a simple thing like fishin'. Some people might, but I don't think you would. He's here. It's about time. We all know what we have to do. So let's do it. The lone wolf I'll always be The black sheep of the family Passin' through places that I've been - Wait up. - Goddamn it, Mason. Of all the days for you to show up late. First, the idiot April calls in sick, then I got a bad tooth... and then my night man shows up when he feels like it. Darlene, it's 5:30. Now, I worked late for you this morning, and you didn't want to spring for overtime, remember? Oh. Well, I have got to get to the dentist before he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor. - I can handle it. - Mm, it doesn't take a genius. Well, how'd we do today, Doc? Oh, caught a few, lost a few. Story of my life. Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there. - I'll tell you that. - Oh, no? You're two of a kind, Doc. He may not have your sheep skins, and, well, most of the time, he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but he's smart enough to get you somehow. There's something else too. Uh, we both like to fish. - Secrets. - Ah. His, I know. Yours, I don't have a clue. But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town. You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene? And you ain't gonna start now. - Mason! - Yeah? Be sure you feed Bosco. And don't give him any ice cream, like April. It gives him gas. And make sure there's two pots of coffee ready-- - Before the morning crowd blows in. - I got it, Darlene. - Is this stool taken? - No. Go-- You look good, Richard. You look fit, healthy. Not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of 18 people. Is that why you're here? To blame me? You could've saved yourself the trip. I know where the blame belongs. But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew. The government did. Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you. Actually, I just come to say how grateful I am to you and the government. - Grateful? - Mm-hmm. Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize... just how very wrong my life had gone. Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in? Well, you were right, of course, but after years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem. What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've always done, Richard? Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those men every time I've closed my eyes? - But after you went away-- - "Went away"? "Went away." I like that. It's almost quaint. All right. After they put you away, I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon... - that we tested on Horn Island. - And let me guess-- you failed. So far, y-yes. Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction so quickly, but when it comes to cures and benefits, your speedis nothing short of glacial? Though at least you're trying, Richard. And if the road to hellispaved with good intentions, we know you'll find your way there quickly. And don't worry. It's not such a bad place. I should know, after all. Okay, Doc. The usual. Doc! - Good morning, Dr. Long. - Hi. Morning, Doc. Awful early, aren't ya? Couldn't sleep, Pump. Is everything all right tonight? There's nothin' goin' on out there, Doc, except maybe the occasional fly fisherman. Hey, Doc. Might wanna try this one out sometime. Nice one. Colonel Brynner. I got an appointment to see Dr. Long. Can I see some I.D., sir? Video lock. You got 30 minutes. Forget about him. Let's find the prize. Vaughn. We're in. This is it. Yeah! Do you work for my boss, dog? Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. At least somebody likes this shit. - Mornin'. - Little early for a delivery. Yeah, I'm tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits 90. - Where's Sam? - Sam? Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind. - Where do you want this stuff? - Freezer in the back. - Art. - Mornin', Mason. Two large coffees to go, okay? All right. So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh, were you out, uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here working? If it was Wednesday night, I was working. - You recognize this young man? - Nope. Is there a problem? You find yourself wearing a badge someday, then you can ask the questions. Until then, you answer mine, got that? So you don't remember selling this young man beer Wednesday night? I don't sell beer to minors. I take that kind of thing seriously. - That's not the way I hear it. Matter of fact-- - Take it easy, Pappas. - Mason, this boy says you did sell him beer that night. - Yeah? Well, he's lyin'. Lying? Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you. We've got your whole record. We know about the conviction for vagrancy, public drunkenness. - I didn't sell the boy any beer. -Shut your mouth until I tell you to talk, son. You know, I gotta tell you. That really bothers me-- somebody calls me "son." Then how about if I call you "asshole"? All right, both of you, just cool off. Look, Mason, maybe the kid showed you a fake I.D., or you forgot to check. I didn't forget to check, and I know how to spot a fake I.D., especially from a little geek like that kid. That little geek is my son. All right. Enough. Look. Mason, I don't wanna hear about you sellin' alcohol to minors. - I didn't sell any alcohol-- - I'm not sayin' you did. Just don't, okay? You make sure you keep your nose clean, we won't have any problems. Let's go, Pappas. - I said, let's go. - You got a problem too? No, sir. I've never seen this guy before. Sure as hell met a few assholes like that, though. - You gotta learn to lighten up when the man's in your face. - That's my business. - No argument there. - Guy's a fuckin' moron. Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick. Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'? Uh, between this month and last month, you owe $417. And we need that in cash. Since when does Darlene pay you in cash? Since today. New policy. Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual, and let them sort it out. Move. Well, he told me to collect cash. - Andy-- another fuckin' moron. - Hey. You and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. Uh-huh? Except for the fact that I need cash. - He could've called first. - He could've. That's true. But that would've been smart and fair. Two things Andy is not. But I tell you what. Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent off. Say, uh, 375, seein' that we both have so much love for Andy. I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over the mountain. That'll make up the difference, huh? Huh? Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies. I could always give you that. No, no, no, no, no. Wait. Night Shift, see? A check is not cash. Cash got a whole lot of numbers on it, pictures of old white men with messed-up hairdos. That's what I need. All right, all right. I'll go you one better: 275, and I'll tell him you'll make up the balance next month, huh? Doc! - Oh, oh, Jesus. - Wait. Hang on. - What the-- - Shit! Oh, shit. - Is that his truck? - Yeah, that's my truck. Mason, you have to take this to Fort McGruder in his truck. Wait. This town is full of trucks. Nice new trucks. - You don't need to go take my sorry-- - We need your truck. - Call an ambulance. - Mason, no. There's no time. I don't see it. Turn around at the gas station. Look behind the buildings. So you called the damn thing "Elvis"? I had no idea how powerful it was. Eighteen men were killed in seconds... with just a fraction of what's here. Mason. And now the man who did this, he's-- he's coming after it. You can't let him have it. - You have-- have toget it to McGruder. - Hey. Hey, Night Shift. Why don't you make it $150. We'll call it a day. - There. - Check it out. Carl, the main phone junction. Move. This is already affecting our schedule. Dennis, radio the bikes. I wanna know if so much as a squirrel comes up that road. Yes, sir. The compound has to be kept cold, or it'll ignite. Cold? Cold. How cold? Never let it reach 50 degrees. And what if it does? Everything will die, Mason. In seconds, everything for hundreds of miles. That's why you need his truck. Mason. It's clean. Check the immediate area. This was supposed to be a quick in and out. You have ten percent of 100 million dollars comin' your way. I think we can impose on you for a little overtime. You're the only one I can trust. The only one who understands... what this m-means, Mason, Mason. Doc! Doc, wait. Doc, wait. Wait, Doc. No! No! Sorry, man, he's dead. It's after 5:00, sir. Our satellite link is on schedule. Should I start the feed? Get'em on line, then stall. Long can't have gotten far. - Closin' down, sir. - Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street. Fan out and work your way back to the motel. We gotta get help. Aw, fuck! It's dead. - Mornin'. - Is this your establishment? Yeah, they call me Darlene. Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene? - Iced coffee. - I assume you want that to go. Assumptions are always dangerous. - That's quite a get up for jacking deer. - I beg your pardon. You wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me. But most people, they just take a six and a rifle. You, on the other hand, look like you're after something more dangerous. Actually, I was just looking for a restroom. I assume you have one. Assumptions are always dangerous. There is one in the back. Hey. Hey, be cool. Be-- Be-- That was quick. To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist... who's gone missing from the tech center. Maybe you know him-- Richard Long. - We're worried about him. - I'll keep an eye out. Doc Long. Doc Long. Yeah, I know him. Weird old guy. He comes in from time to time, yeah. Not tonight, though. Odd, then, that his car should be right outside. Like I say, Doc Long's an odd guy. Say, General. That'll be 50 cents for the coffee. What did I say? Dude in a uniform get in your face, you do not shout your mouth off. I need your truck. No, no, no, you don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck... and a shit load ofice. If I don't get this to McGruder, it's good-bye Andy's Ice Cream, good-bye Montana. Wait, man. You don't believe the dead guy, do you? Yeah, I believe him. He was my friend. Oh, for cryin' out loud. Hey, listen, you know what I think? I think he's a wacko, and I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko. And I think you're the biggest wacko of all, wantin' to be a part this wacko shit. I need your help. - You are mistaken if you think you're goin' anywhere in my truck. - Then you drive me to McGruder. Look, I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream... sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago. That shit will be worthless by noon. - Oh, man. - And if that Elvis shit... is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away as possible. - Peace. - Fine. - Slap the red off his neck. Ain't gonna take my truck. - Wait, hold up. Look. You want cash? You want cash? I got like, uh-- I got, uh-- I got 50 bucks. I'll get more. I'll rent the truck from you. You can go, you can stay here. Whatever you want. No. - Then how about this? - Hey, you're gonna piss me-- What the hell you doin'? - I need your truck. - You are not takin' my truck! How far you got to go? Go. Move it. Go on. Goddamn it. Would you hurry up? Now put this in the back. Keep it safe. Come on, let's go. - Did you keep it safe? - Yeah, I kept it safe. What the hell is with you, dog? He's the one with the damn gun. - You gave him ice cream, didn't you? Come on, let's go. - To keep him off my ass. What'd you do that for? It makes him mean as a snake. That dog was mean before I met him. That dog ain't mean. - Get in the truck. Shh! - I will bust a mud hole in your ass. - Don't tell me to shush. I can talk all I want to. - Just shut up. - Are you kiddin'? Come on. - Damn. - What the hell's goin' on? It happens to this piece of shit all the time. Damn diesel injectors are flooded. - Excuse me, can you fix this? - You wanna give me a minute? Well, if it's national security, I guess it's okay. I just hope we don't bust in on anybody... doing what people do in motels. Shit. Wait for me here, sir, if you don't mind. Get in. Damn dog. Hey. Hey. Hey. Get back in the truck. You mean to tell me to get in the truck. I'll kick your ass in a minute if you play that. Better coast through town. We're clear. Whoo-hoo, there he is. Hold it, I hear something. - Get Brynner on the radio. - Come in, command. Truck just passed check point. Over. - Run that back. - Let me enhance it. Print it. Sir, this transmission just came in. Well, it appears someone's been lying to us. Alert the bikes. - It's in the back of the truck. You have a go. - Roger, we're on it. Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay. Any further orders? So, a pair of average citizens have decided... to risk their lives for their country. I almost remember what that feels like. No signal. Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone. Billings? No, no, no, no. We need to go to McGruder. No, you gotta go to McGruder. - No, no, no, no, no, we gotta go to McGruder. I go where the truck goes. - No. To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' through Missoula. - No way. We're goin' to McGruder. - I ain't going through Missoula. Am I missin' somethin' here? Look, I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy. - "Borrowed"? - Yeah, borrowed! You stole this truck. You stole this truck! - I did not steal this truck. - You stole this truck. That's what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it? You stole this truck, and now you're tryin' to sell the ice cream for money. I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me! Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula. I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at 100 miles an hour, we're goin' to McGruder. Remember, I still have this. Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man. - That's fine. Whatever. - I ain't playin' now. Hey. We can't push old Pete in this heat. He can't take it. Fine. You better speed old Pete up. Pull over! - Holy shit. Goddamn. - Okay, okay. One of 'em's in the back. - No, no, no, no, no. Keep going. - Okay. - You're not goin' back there! - Shut up! - Take your gun! - Doesn't work. - What? - Doesn't work. It's not even loaded. You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun? - Yep. - Hey. When this is all over, remind me to kick your ass! Looks like our share just got bigger. Aw, shit. - Oh, shit. - Help! Help! - No! - Aw, shit. Get him to stand up, Night Shift. Hey! Okay! All right! - So you're sure it was Mason? - Positive. He came out of the store with the ice cream guy. The men from the base, they took off right after 'em. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Must've happened right after we left. Missoula's reporting a refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle. I told you Mason was walking shit. Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer. Now what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh? The sooner you get up to the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out. - And where are you goin'? - After that refrigerator truck. - Elvis is on ice again. - Okay. Nice job back there. Hey, don't give me that "nice job" shit, man. They still got a vanload comin' and what do you got besides an empty gun? - I was thankin' you, asshole. - Kiss my ass! - 911 Emergency. - It's goin' through. - Please hold. - You gotta-- They put me on hold. - Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one. - I'm not the psycho. Take a look at your situation, and reconsider that statement, Night Shift. You're a psycho and a hijacker. - The gun was empty. - Every time I look at you, I wanna hit you. - You wanna hit me? - You know, I'm a peaceful man. I believe in live and let live. Yeah, you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right? - I did not steal the truck. It was owed to me. - You stole the damn truck! - Shut up, shut up, it's beeping. - Well, then, that means it's call waiting. - You snatch that phone from me one more time-- - Hey! Hey! Andy's Ice Cream. Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for. Give it to me now, or you'll be dead within five minutes. - It's for you. - Yeah? Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither your concern nor your fight. Relinquish the package, and you can go. - I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - What'd he say? Don't be tedious. Dr. Long called it Elvis. You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you? Listen, shithead! I got $3,000 of highly perishable ice cream product... that tastes bad enough when it's frozen, so if you don't mind-- Just give me Elvis, and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks. - I don't ever wanna see another ice cream truck! - Give me the goddamn phone. - Talk to me. - I want you to look at one another... and ask a simple question: Are you actually prepared... to die for a country that's never done a thing for you? 'Cause if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end... on this miserable road to nowhere. And I can't guarantee the end will be quick. Elvis is fucking dead, man. Get yourself some CD's. Vaughn, get the M-79 ready. You can't fire on them. You're gonna detonate the crystals. Prep the launcher now. Now! Oh, shit. Your move. Okay, Vaughn, you drive. Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop! Stop this boat! Whoa! Slow down! God! Whoa! - Holy shit, man. - Oh, shit. Back up, back up. Come on, old Pete. Come on. There it is, old Pete. Come on, baby. You got it, you got it. Go, go, go! Got it, got it, got it. Fuck! Oh. Oh, shit. Oh, we're screwed, Night Shift. You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass good-bye, buddy. - I think we can make it. - You think we can make what? You see that truck? Eight-and-a-half feet wide. Weighs over five tons. And what if we don't make it? Your weed killer on steroids goes down with us, everybody dies. I don't think we have much of a choice, do we? - Oh, shit. - That's right, now move. Oh, shit. Okay, okay, okay. Unbe-fucking-lievable. - Oh, goddamn. - Oh, Petey. Oh, Petey. Oh, please, Pete. Please, don't do this to me. Okay. Okay! I should've had that dog bite me. I would've got rabies. Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse. Hey, hey! Whoo! Okay! Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Come on, old Pete. Come on. Come on, old Pete. Oh, man! I'm goin', I'm goin', baby. I'm goin', I'm goin'. Easy, easy, easy. Left, left, left. Get over, get over. Come on. Oh, shit. Come on, old Pete! Come on! Come on, old Pete. Oh. I know the likelihood of you knowin' any prayers is slim, but give it a try. Come on. Come on, old Pete. Come on. Come on, you crazy bastard. All right, you got it, you got it. You got it, got it, got it. Go, go, go, go, go! Go! - Whoo! - I made it! Whoo! - I made it! Oh, man. - What are you talkin' about? I'm the one drivin'. You okay? What the fuck was that? - Shit. You gotta pass him. - Gee, you think so? Okay. That didn't work. - Gee, you think so? - Shut up! Here we go. Oh, oh, whoa, whoa. Ho! Go on. Go on. Go, go. Old Pete. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot! Okay, okay. - Come on. - Okay. All right. - Okay, all right. - Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that. - Okay, okay. - These'll keep it cold. Yeah, yeah. Oh, shit. All right. - Okay. - Okay, all right. Okay. Let's go. - Hey, put it back. Shake it off. - Shit! Hey, wait, wait, wait. I got an idea. - Hey, what's goin' on here? Are you guys all right? - Stay back! Stay back! I'm taking your boat. - Listen to him! You don't know who you're dealing with! - I'm a dangerous man. He's a dangerous man! He's crazy! I'm crazy? I'm crazy! - What are you doin'? - Takin' her downhill. You're what? You're not dangerous. You're crazy. I ain't gettin' into this thing. - Then stay here. - Oh, shit. Okay. Come on. Oh, hell, no! - I didn't want you to come anyway. - What? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let-- Be still. Okay. Okay. No! Oh, shit! No! Oh, no! Backwards! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Fuck. - All right. Hey. Are you crazy? Take the boat? There's nothing in here, sir. They got away with it. All right, let's clear the mess and move out. - Uh-oh. Thing just went up a degree. - What? - Ice cream's not workin'. - This river's fed by a glacier. I'm willin' to bet my life it's a good deal under 50 degrees. What do you think? Worth a try. - You didn't lock the truck when you got out, did ya? - You're fucked, man. - Now why would you do that to a man in my position? - I didn't steal the truck. - You stole the truck. - I told you, I did not steal that truck. Andy owed me a lot more than that four-wheeled piece of shit was worth. - It won't even start half the time. - You know what I'm sayin'? I deserve a lot more than that truck. Ten years-- Ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard. Hes wore once I got a degree, there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it. But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin... or nephew or some good old boy... just ready to just slide him right in there. What about me? What about Arlo, huh? What about my needs? You know, I got student loans, overdrawn bank account. Nobody lookin' out for my interest. My credit was fucked! And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped, so I split. - So you took his truck? - So I took his truck, yeah. This river ends at a hydro dam in Missoula. All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does. Carl, Dennis, get out of sight. - Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here. - Tell me what's going on. I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Commander out of Fort Bragg. We were calledin by the Jerome base to pursue a man who's stolen government property. - Right. Tim Mason. - You know the suspect? Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome General Store. - Richard Long. - That's right. Long went missing from the tech center along with a dangerous chemical weapon. I'd deeply appreciate your assistance on this. Who knows? It might even put some more gold on that collar of yours. Four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State. - We were nationally ranked. - How wonderful for you. Started every game my senior year. Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend. Quarterback. Got taken in the first round. - Robert Del Real? - Yeah, Robert Del Real. I remember him. Got in a car crash or something. We were celebratin' after the draft, goin' from bar to bar. I was drivin', and I put the car into a ditch. He spent 18 weeks in the hospital. He's never gonna throw a ball in the pros. Couldn't deal with it, so I split. And things sort of just went downhill from there. Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome workin' for Darlene. Well, shit. Could be worse. I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle. We got two paddles. - Is the facility secure? - Yes, sir, Colonel. There's four dead, but the security video's clean. It's a patched-in feed. It's probably a loop. Deputy! Deputy, I'm Colonel Vitelli. I'm on special assignment. Deputy Art Lewis-- Jerome County Sheriff's Department. - I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about. - I will tell you what I can. Colonel Vitelli, we got a busted encode vault inside. - Is it-- - Looks like it. Yes, sir. Alert 75th Rangers. Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building. - What the hell are you talkin' about, Colonel? - Did they I.D. the bodies? - They were all wearing hardware. - Any of them Richard Long? No, sir. I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office. One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the 35. - Who's your suspect? - A man named Tim Mason. - Run a check. F.B.I., Interpol. - Yes, sir. If you're right, this Mason's one hell of a pro. Must have a record somewhere. Mason? No. He's a soda-jerk drifter. A hamburger flipper. It could be a cover, I suppose. Who ever did this is a man who knows his business. Listen, Arlo. For whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this shit. To tell you the truth, you didn't. Not completely, anyway. Even if that gun was loaded, I didn't buy you as a shooter. It was your friend, Long. Something about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis shit. All the same, if we get to Missoula, help me find a car. I'd appreciate it. Then you can split. Split? I wouldn't get ten miles. Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here. We need to finish this, Night Shift. Hang onto your ass, Missoula. Arlo's back! And he's bringing the King! Damn! Hey, Arlo! Well, that just about figures for today. So, where's my truck? It's, uh, parked just off of Highway 35. I did what I could for you, Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now where's my goddamn truck? I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy. But I could tell you this-- Takin' your truck pissed you off. Huh? You're gonna be realmad when I take the pickup. And so, Missoula's prodigal son returns. - Hello? - I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason. I urge you to be persuasive. This country trained me to kill... without compunction. Well, well, well, funny situation, ain't it, Andy? Three seconds. One-- - You gotta help me, Arlo. - Two-- - Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to help you? - I'm sorry. I'll make it up. - Gentlemen, I have never been known for my patience. - Arlo! - Arlo! - All right. Hey, hey. Hey. Mason. - Yeah? - Looks like you gotta cut a deal with this asshole. Even though it is nice to see Andy squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt... or my conscience. - And you owe me, man. - Yeah, I know, I know. - You still there, Mr. Mason? - Yeah, I'm listenin'. Come meet me at the dam in 15 minutes. Be intelligent about this. Tricks'll cost lives. Create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instinct into overdrive, forcing him to strike. - Everything all right, son? - Yeah, just... tryin' to remember something somebody once told me about tyin' a fly. And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey can fight back. Let me have those. Sir, I think you should take a look at this. Judging by the signature pulse and velocity, helicopters. Maybe 15 minutes. Rangers. That was only a matter of time. Of which we have more than enough. All right, listen up! Stay sharp! Now this is the guy we're looking for. His name is Tim Mason. - He's got the acrylic container. - Do we know what's inside? You don't need to know. Let's just get it back, all right? - I don't see my container. - Try anything, it goes in the river. It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason. Just give me the container. Where's Arlo? Bring him here. I love the leather pants. Bring him down! Your fellow hero, untouched and unharmed, despite the mouth. Him first. Run! Down! - Rangers. - Let's go. - You should've taken the money. - Bullshit! You would've killed us anyway. Shit. Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn. - Get these two behind the van. - Move! Move! - I got the container. Bring it in. - That's not Mason. Doesn't matter who he is. We're goin' in. Go! Go! Move it! Come on, come on! Are you all right? That's far enough, gentlemen. You know who I am? - Gas masks. - Gas masks? Gas masks? The men on Horn Island had gas masks. - Where the fuck is Horn Island? - Was. Horn Island was. Listen, Arlo. - Hey! - Shut your mouth! Do you know what'll happen if I drop this? - Brynner. - Well, Lieutenant Vitelli. Good to see you again, Leo. A pleasant surprise. I can't say it's a surprise, and I certainly can't say it's pleasant. As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind. I checked your release date. I never like coincidences. And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you'll remember. Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy? He was Major Andrew Brynner. We did two tours together in Vietnam... until he got busted down to nursemaiding scientists. Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civilians, but I assure you, Leo, I lost all my squeamish ness at Leavenworth. I'll have no compunction at all about using this. Hmm? Wind's northwest. That oughta be Seattle. Or I may be wrong. Breeze could be gusting south. That'd be Billings. Maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper, - Destry, Fair Oaks. - Knowing you, you've got buyers waiting to buy. You're not gonna use that here. I'm warning you, Leo, don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die. I'll do it. - Tell the choppers we're liftin' off. - Excuse me, sir? Your colonel's giving you a wise order, soldier. It's not over, Brynner. - Sir, we just can't let him get away with this! - Gomez-- You fight the battles you can win. We've been out maneuvered here. Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell to the highest bidder. To do that, he has to have planned an exit point. That's where we intercept him. That's when we make our play. You and your men back off. All right, let's move out! - They're taking off. They're leaving. - Huh? Dennis, get your links set up. I wanna patch in from here. - What about these two? - We're gonna use 'em for demonstration footage. Having witnessed the effects, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts. - Get 'em in the middle of the dam. - Yes, sir. - Up! - Taipei is on-line. Geneva's comin' up, and we should have Karachi and Kabul in a couple of minutes. All right. Tell the pilot we'll be a half hour. Carl, set up the camera! Dennis, we will open the bidding at $100 million. It won't be long, gentlemen. And it won't be pleasant. But such is the price of patriotism. Vaughn. Hey! - Hey! - Shut up. - We gonna die. - Shut up. - Everybody's linked up. - All right. Clear the area. - We're gonna die! We're gonna die! - Hey, hey, hey. Put your hand in my pants. - What? We gonna die, you want me to do some freakish shit! - Arlo! Arlo. Reach into my pocket. Okay, okay. - Come on! - Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. All right. - Okay, okay. - Give me your shoes. Okay. Okay. Arlo! I'm sorry. I'm just a little stressed, little stressed. - I'm on it. - Stay put. Keep the camera on them. Boundor loose, their deaths will be equally effective and inevitable. Sir, I got Taipei grinding on me here. How long is this supposed to ta-- - I borrowed a truck. - Oh, you borrowed, but I stole the truck. Geneva just pulled the plug. Kabul is out. Okay. Come on, come on. Pakistan says they'll be back tomorrow. - And Taipei just went off-line, sir. - Go. - Okay, here we go. - Go, go, go! - You just can't leave that stuff with that lunatic. - I didn't give it to him. - What? You got Elvis? - Sometimes the prey bites back. Go! Hang on! Whoo! - Aw, shit. Would you be more careful? - Okay. Okay. - Positions! We're taking up the hunt. - Come on, Brynner, it's over. Nobody said anything about goin' up against Rangers. Besides, how we gonna sell something we don't have? Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis. They made a tactical withdrawal. It's just those two amateurs now. You really wanna concede $100 million to them? Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier. He'll be most useful now. We need more ice. There's a service station on the other end of the North Ridge Tunnel. They'll have ice. Fuck-- 45.7. - Oh, shit. - Come on, come on, come on. - Come here! - What's going on, Colonel? All right, this is what I want you to do. The Ranger units in McGruder have got the local airports covered, sir. - Pentagon's covering the international traffic. - Good. Gomez, I want two birds back to Missoula. - I wanna rendezvous here, approach from the southwest. - Yes, sir. Let's do it! Colonel, you've got a Tim Mason patched through from McGruder. - This is Vitelli. Is that you, Mason? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Colonel! - Listen, I've got Elvis! I got the real thing. - We! We got Elvis! What? Say again, Mason. What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony. - We've got the real thing! - Where are you now? I'm at mile marker 62... heading west on 35. - Here they come! - Brynner's right on our ass! He's comin' up fast! Hit him. Shit! Hit him again. We gotta take out Brynner's van before they reach that tunnel. Get ready to take it out. - Okay, here comes the tunnel. - Tunnel. - Do it now! - Hit it now! Good. Head for the other end of the tunnel. I'll stay here and secure this position. - Forty-seven-- you'd better floor it. - What do you think I'm doin'? It's a damn postal truck. - What the hell? - What the-- You've gotta be kiddin' me. - Let me see your hands. - Oh! Pappas, move the car! - Move the car, please! - Unbe-fucking-lievable. I said, let me see your hands now! You redneck idiot, do you have any idea what's goin' on here? Yeah, asshole. I'm puttin' a murder suspect... and a guy that stole a truck under arrest-- now raise 'em. Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb... that is going to explode if we don't get out of this tunnel! No sign of 'em, Colonel. Yeah? - Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis? - Forty-seven. If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the tunnel. God! They're gonna seal it. - Why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here? - What the hell's a sage? Listen, Pappas, there's a colonel on the other end of this phone. His name's Vitelli. Talk to him. He's right outside. What happened to Colonel Brynner? Listen, Deputy. He's the dude the Army guys are lookin' for. Bullshit. Put the phone down, Mason. - I've had enough of both of you. - Wait. Listen to me, Pappas. If you don't let us by, we're all gonna die in this tunnel now! - Go check the temperature. - Don't move. Shoot me. What's it say? Forty-nine point four. - It says 49. - Forty-nine? Colonel, we gotta seal that tunnel. Colonel! - Night Shift. It's melting, man. - What? Oh, shit. Shit. - Mason, Mason. - Yeah? It's too late, Mason. I've gotta seal it. Right. All right, we're gonna seal that tunnel. I want it air tight. What the hell was that? - It's the Army sealin' us in. - Jesus. - What the hell is goin' on? - All I had to do was get it on ice. Now it's over! Kiss your ass good-bye, Pappas. Ice? You want ice? I got a whole case of beer... - back here in the car floatin 'in the stuff. - You're kiddin' me! - Nail it up. - Okay. - We've got ice! - What? Say again, Mason. I can barely hear you. - We've got it on ice. We've got Elvis on ice. - Hold it. Come on. - We're too late. - Oh. - Oh, we're too late. - Oh, shit. Oh, we're too late. - It's workin'. - What? - What? What? - It's working. - We gotta get outta here. - Vitelli! Can we get out on your end of the tunnel? Negative! Negative! There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle. He must've had a damned arsenal in there. Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway. There's gotta be another way outta here. Hold this. Sorry. I think I found a way out. There's a vent shaft leading straight up. Okay. I'll have a chopper meet you at the top. - All right, I'll lead 'em out. - You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Go on. Follow me. - Come on, let's go. - That's it. Hang on, hang on. - Let's go! - Got it? Come on, darlin'. Come on, darlin', I got ya. Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis. You go. - They'll meet you at the top. - Okay. Come on, big guy. Faster. Come on, Night Shift. No. Where's Elvis? Dead, last time I checked. - Kill him now. - Ah, don't worry. - I'm a professional. This won't hurt a bit. - Well, I'm an amateur. And this is gonna hurt like hell. Come on! All right, squat over there. Grab him. - Is Elvis out? - Negative, negative. - Why? You're a nothing. Nobody. Why? - You'd never understand. I would've in another life. They took that life away and left me with nothing. But now I have it all. - What'd you come back for? - Why'd you stay behind? Elvis is still in there. It's gonna go off. Now! Seal that tunnel now! - Do you need some help gettin' in the ambulance? - No, thanks. You know, we saved half a million people from a full body peel. We're the shit. Big-time. They aren't exactly gonna publicize this, Arlo. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, we're heroes, my man. It's time to start actin' like it. Quit limpin' around like that. - Excuse me, I got a bullet in my leg. - Always the negative with you. All right, gentlemen, we're about done here. - Fine job. - Thank you. Your country and a lot of innocent people in it owe you. - Us. Owe us. - You did help a little. Who drove the ice cream truck that kept Elvis cool? Who had to put a gun to your head? Who put the big hurt on that Army nut job to save your narrow butt? - You, Arlo. You! - Hello? Right. You damn skippy. And now that I am both jobless... and-- and truckless in the service of my country, - I feel that my government owes me a little restitution. - Us. Owes us. I'll handle it from here, sweet dear. Owes us a little restitution. We do have to take into consideration, that through your courage... - and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives. - Exactly. However, you are also non-enlisted personnel with detailed knowledge... of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act. In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you, to take any extreme measures I deem necessary, including the permanently extreme. - I'd say we're about even. - Patriotism is its own reward. I think so too. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - What about all that "no need to get in the man's face" crap? - I was not in the man's face. - I was negotiating. - That's negotiating? He threatened to kill us. -But he didn't. See, that's negotiation. -No. - That's bullshit. - Bullshit, yeah. Well, if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar somewhere. Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us. Nobody's even gonna know this happened, except for the Army, you and me. - You shouldn't be walking on that. - Hello, somebody. Heard you saved a lot of lives. The Army said it was a terrorist bomb. - Oh, I feel faint. - Oh! - Oh, you got me? You got me? Okay. - I got ya. - You got me? - I got ya. Hold on. - It's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It all started with our mission in Istanbul, you see. I was undercover as a tennis player. Code name was Blackjack. Night Shift was my coach. Uh-uh-uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach. He handled the rackets, and I carried the balls. - You see, that was my mission. - He was using big balls. That's right. Ooh, that's it. Just grab-- just put your arm-- Don't be afraid. You got a nice strong grip for a woman. - Yes, you do. - Wait here a minute. I'm gonna bandage you. - And that's a wonderful walkie-talkie you got there. - Do I have to get naked? - I don't have to? - Thank you.
