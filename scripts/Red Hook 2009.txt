WELL, SHOW US. YEAH, APPARENTLY, THIS IS A SCAVENGER HUNT. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK. (Jenny) I'M NOT OPENING IT. HINT-IF HE WAS GONNA BREAK UP WITH YOU IN A LETTER, HE'D LEAVE I ON YOUR DOOR. THAT'S WEIRD. "FIND JENNY TRAYLOR." (scoffs) THIS HAD BETTER BE THE RIGHT ONE, 'CAUSE IF I GO TO ANOTHER INTERNET CAF, I WILL SCREAM. I WAS STARTING TO THINK WE WERE NEVER GONNA FIND SOMEONE REALLY NAMED ASMER-MER-MER... (giggles) YOU MUST BE FROM THE SCAVENGER HUNT. YES, WE ARE. WAIT, THAT'S MINE! WE-WE GOT HERE FIRST. HEY, HOW MANY OF THESE CAFS HAVE YOU BEEN TO? SIX. AND HOW MANY ASMERETS HAVE YOU TALKED TO? ACTUALLY, SHE IS THE FIRST. YOU? SEVEN. (laughs) I HAVE OTHER CUSTOMERS. OH. IT'S TOO SMALL FOR A DOOR. I'M SO TIRED OF TIM'S GAMES. YEAH... (sighs) UH, SINCE NO ONE WANTED TO BE MY PARTNER FOR THE HUNT, AND SINCE YOU'VE BEEN STOOD UP, YOU'RE AS BIG A LOSER AS I AM.

SERIOUSLY, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO GE OVER THIS PARANOIA THING. OH, MY GOD. OKAY, SHE'S KINDA RIGHT. YOU DID THINK LIEUTENANT FOX WAS A STALKER. DOES ANYBODY THINK THAT MAYBE GAVIN IS ACTUALLY IN TROUBLE? AND THAT-THAT WHETHER THIS FINGER IS REAL OR NOT, THAT WE NEED TO FIND HIM? ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, EITHER WAY, TIM WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

COME ON, ROY. YOU COMING? HEY, IF THERE'S SOMETHING UP WITH CAMILLE, I WANT TO KNOW. HEY, DUDE, PLEASE. YOU NEVER HAD A CHANCE. "HAD"? OKAY, LISTEN. CAMILLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A RAMPANT SLUT, BUT SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE IN HER WILDEST DREAMS LOWERED HERSELF TO GET IT ON WITH YOU. "MIGHT HAVE BEEN." WHAT? IS SHE, LIKE, DEAD? SHE'S DEAD TO ME. YOU WANT HER, YOU GOT HER. I'M GOING BACK TO CAMPUS. WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND TIM THERE. WHY NOT? IT'S GETTING LATE, AND HE'S PROBABLY ALREADY AT THE FINAL DESTINATION.
