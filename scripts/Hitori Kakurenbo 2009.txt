Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. Ms. Kashiwagi. The bell's rung. Are you okay? You don't look well. Oh, I'm sorry. Take it easy. I've been having the same dream lately. A dream of my childhood. She's still in that park... as if time had stopped since then. Class's already started. Get back in the classroom. Mr. Akai. Here. Mr. Ito. Here. Ms. Inoue. Here. Ms. Uno. Where's Ms. Uno? She went to the nurse's office. I see. Mr. Otsuka. It's just mild anemia. Okay. I heard her parents got devorced. Yes. I guess she's having a hard time now. Ms. Uno? How's your mother doing? She's working at night. I see. How do you eat supper? I'm eating all right. Well... I should go. Yeah. Ms. Uno. An assignment from the class. Deadline's next week. See you tomorrow. Do you know... "creepy hide-and-seek?" What's that? A game? Yes. It's a game. It's popular now. Oh, yeah? Good bye. Bye. "Kids' land: Did you see the paper?" "Pond: Yes. It said there was a doll stabbed with a knife... " "Sara: The missing girl's name was on the Net... Mai Nakatsuka. " "Pond: You think it's Mai-mai?" "Goto: There's no mention of creepy hide-and-seek. " Ms. Kashiwagi! You brought lunch? No. Let's eat out, then. Sure. Let's go. You know, Mr. Yamagata got fired from the previous school. Really? PTA complained that he was into necromancy and the occult. I guess he's in some creepy cult. Hey! Wear your shoes decently. Hey. Last year... Someone jumped from here. Remember? Yeah... I guess. So what? Apparently... He had been our classmate... since elementary school. Oh, yeah? You remember him? No, I don't. Hey. Wanna meet me after school? Sure... I guess. What's that? Is it fun? Maybe... She said it's popular. I've never heard of it. A manga? It's a game. I see. You know Aikawa, a student in my class? He was in your class last year, right? Yeah. What about it? He often skips school lately. He was doing fine in classes and the soccer team. But at the end of the year... his mother passed away. Kids today are sensitive. You okay? Fine. Recently... My dad's being annoying. Uh-huh. He's like, "How's school going?" He never cared before. I wish he would die. I think... I may kill him. Don't bother. They will die first, anyway. "They?" They... Adults. It's time. I'm gonna lock the room. Is anybody there? I'm closing the room. "Creepy Hide-and-Seek" Ready or not... Here I come... "Maya: What will happen if you don't finish hide-and-seek properly?" "Sara:" "I don't know. " "Nobody will ever know about that for sure. " "Unknown: It is said that... " "what appears in this necromancy is" "someone who has a grudge against you. " "And it will haunt you. " "Goto: What I heard is a little different from that. " "I heard the dead who died in your area will appear. " "Maya:" "Can we kill people with creepy hide-and-seek?" "Kids' land:" "It might be possible if... " "you name the doll after the one you want to kill. " "Scary tale: I've never heard of it. " "It's bullshit. You should be haunted. " "Goto: Nobody will ever find out the truth. " "Things like this are always uncertain. " "That's why we can't deny any possibilities. " (First floor.) Hey. Aikawa. Do you know "creepy hide-and-seek?" No. Are you students? We don't go to school. Where do you live? Tell me your names. Can you come with me? Everything's such a drag. I gotta go. Wait. What you said before... What? About killing your dad... Oh. I know how you can do it. What's wrong? Huh? You said you wanna kill him. But... Give me that. His name? Why? Tell me. Kenichi. "I found you, Kenichi. " Let's go. C'mon. It's meaningless. You're not hiding? It's fine, but I don't know what will happen if we quit now. What's the matter with you? "Maya: Would you like to play creepy hide-and-seek?" I'm home. Ritsuko... Mom? Ritsuko... Wait. Where've you been so late? Good morning. Good morning, Ms. Kashiwagi. Good morning. Ms. Tamura called in sick. Could you substitute for her in the first period? Yes, of course. Thanks. It's time for class. Where is your class? Wait! Ms. Uno is missing? Her mother just called and said she hasn't been home for 3 days. She reported it to the police. But they haven't found her yet. I'll go to her house, then. Okay. It doesn't mean she's in serious trouble yet, so don't tell anyone. This is my fault. I wasn't there for her when she needed me. But we don't know for sure what happened yet. Something was wrong with her these days. Do you have any idea where she might be? "How to Play Creepy Hide-and-Seek" "Things to prepare: A doll, rice, a needle... " "First, remove the filling from the doll... " I bought her this when she was little... I didn't know she still had this. This was at the front door. I'm sure... she got involved in some trouble. It's hardly possible she ran away from home... I know nothing. She was the one who started it. And? And... I got the creeps. So I left. She said she'd put the curse on my dad to kill him. Curse? By calling a ghost. But she didn't know much about it, either. I should be going. Yeah. Thanks. Excuse me. I want to ask you something. It's already been two weeks. Mr. Yamagata, I heard you know a lot about such things. Rumors are usually exaggerated. I'm sorry. My wife collapsed five years ago. We went to many hospitals... but the cause was unknown. Then a friend of mine from college introduced me... a psychic. It may sound ridiculous, but... I was clutching at a straw. I had no idea. I used to teach folklore at a university. Folklore? I'm not sure if this can help you, but... Have you ever heard of "spirited away?" Yes It was a common phenomenon in the past. People said it was goblins' work. Or the god of mountains'. Where were they taken to? I don't know. Some people came back after years passed, others didn't. Does that happen even today? We just don't call it that way today. Using dolls is called "representation. " Like the voodoo doll. As for the water, probably it's derived from the belief... that water parts two worlds. I guess the red thread... represents blood vessels. I heard Ms. Uno had said she'd curse someone to death. Perhaps this is a kind of necromancy. But it can be interpreted in many ways. Peter-Pan story is also "spirited away" from a different perspective. The another world's not necessarily bad for the disappeared. That's improper. I'm sorry. Mr. Yamagata. How is your wife? She passed away last year. "Goto: It's about time. " "Pond: I heard another high school student is missing... " "after playing creepy hide-and-seek. " "Isn't it dangerous to play it now?" "Kids' land: Those who wanna play it should play. " "How to Finish Creepy Hide-and-Seek" "Next... " "you're the tagger. " "How to Finish Creepy Hide-and-Seek" "Blow a mouthful of salt water to the doll. Say 'I win' three times. " Ready or not... Here I come... Ready or not... Not yet... Not yet... Here I come... No... Ready or not... No. Not yet... No... Here I come. Here I come... Did you know Uno is missing? Really? She was kinda weird, don't you think? Oh, yeah. Wanna hear the rumor? She was addicted to chancy drug, so her mom went mad, and... What? Oh my! For real? What? Uh-huh. Oh my God! I can't believe it! Hello, I'm here to see Ms. Tamura. I'm her coworker. Ms. Tamura? Oh, yes, Ms. Tamura. Have you seen her lately? No. I haven't seen her for a while. She hasn't paid last month's rent, and she's not home whenever I visit. Is it possible for me to have the key to her room? And you are...? Her coworker, Kashiwagi. I'm also a teacher. Call me if something comes up. You know the room number? Yes. Ms. Tamura? "Creepy Hide-and-Seek" "The page cannot be displayed" You're the next tagger, Ryoko. Nobuko! Nobuko! Hi. You're awake. Probably you hit your head when you fell down. I don't think it's serious, but let's see for a while. Doctor? How long was I sleeping? It's been two days since you were brought here. Yeah. It's nothing serious. I'll be discharged soon. Don't worry. Uh-huh. Yeah. I know. Mom? Is the park still there? "Goto: Who wants to join me?" "Let me know by 2:50 AM." "FYl, this bulletin board will be shut down... " "at 2:59 AM today. " "Unknown: How's it going?" "Sara: I can already hear rapping. " "Pond:... Oh. " "Unknown: What?" "... I can hear it. " Ready or not... "Ready or not... " Here I come... Ready... or not... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. "Creepy Hide-and-Seek Club" "Yuki:" "Hi. My name is Yuki. " "Lost child:" "I'm interested in creepy hide-and-seek. " "Scary tale: A student in my school disappeared. " "Luna:" "Finishing it properly is the most important. " "MA:" "Maybe the person never existed in the first place. " I'm looking for my daughter. "Missing Girl: Ritsuko Uno" People who disappeared... haven't gone somewhere else. In fact, they are around us... watching us quietly. It's just we lost the heart... to feel their existence. I found you, Nobuko. Nobuko. I found...
