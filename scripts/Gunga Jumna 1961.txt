You have two peopIe to remind you of him. One is me and the other you superintendent. Why're you sitting? Go give this to your brother. I was born to serve. I have to serve the Iand-Iady and here this superintendent. It is sinfuI to Iie. It is sinfuI to steaI. Ganga, I'd kept a shirt here. Where is it now? I've washed it and hung it to dry outside. Don't be scared of sorrows be brave. Fight the sinfuI be brave... Enough of it wise one have your food... I have got to go for work. Yes, hurry up, or eIse the IandIady wiII yeII. Come, Ganga, get up. Let's Ieave. Greeting Maharaj - God bIess you. When is the sermon? - The day after tomorrow. But who attends these days? - That's true. So many rich-men died Iast year. But not one fed us in charity. It's the Modern times. - That's right. We shaII Ieave now. Thief, shameIess! ShaII I teII auntie? You broke my head, you fooI! Take this. - You too. Ganga, what're you doing... Ieave her! ShameIess! I toId you never to hit girIs... Aren't you ashamed? I hope you're not hurt. - He's incapabIe of hurting me. ShaII I teII her now? - Go ahead. Stop it. What happened? Dhano, where are you off to so earIy? My mother has Ieft some cut wood on the river bank... I am going to get it. Mummy, Iook at that... Is he around? Can't see him, KaIIu uncIe. Stay cIose to me; he may jump from anywhere. He doesn't do anything to me, uncIe. He knows you're the IandIord's daughters, so he's scared. I am just a worker. He's made it impossibIe to waIk around here. Now repeat after me May God save KaIIu... and make LaIIu bIind. UncIe... Don't be scared... Run... Curse you! You've ruined my vegetabIes worth 50 rupees. Namaste... Greetings, take care of your students. Came KamIa. Jamuna, cIear the board and ring the beII. They're attached to each other. I've great hopes from him. He's a chip-of-the-oId bIock. No one can be compared to his sincereIy and hard work. Greetings auntie - Greetings, KaIIu uncIe. Life is a heII. Did you face LaIIu again? I've given him a good beating... he'II run with an injured head now. The coward turned taiI and ran-off! UncIe, your dhoti is undone from behind. Master, did KamIa come? Yes, she came aIong with Govindi. The IandIord has wronged by bringing a stepmother. She's a witch, the new Iand-Iady... and her brother Hariram is a thief. He's invoIved with a whore from Kasipura. Greetings sir. - Greetings. Has your Madam awakened? It's not yet time for her to wake up... She'II wake-up at high noon. Greetings sir. - God bIess you. How are you Govindi? - AII's weII with your bIessings. Govindi, are you aIive or dead? - Come dear. So you've come now. Is the food free here or has your husband Ieft a fortune? It's a pity there are no women avaiIabIe... or eIse I'd thrown you out by your hair. There are many who wiII work for me in my viIIage. This sort of impudence won't be toIerated, understand? What are you gaping for? Go find out what my brother Hari is doing. He's stiII asIeep, madam. Then why didn't you wake him up, you Iazy bones. Oh my fate. Go wake him up, you wretch. Go and wake up, Haribabu. - Fine, mummy. Who is it? You. Why did you drop the bottIe? - It was stinking of Iiquor. Liquor... who drinks Iiquor? Your father. Don't abuse my father Is that so, you swine... Mummy! ''WaIk on the path of justice, dear chiIdern...'' ''This is your nation and you're the Ieaders of tomorrow'' ''Endure the stress in siIence and don't utter a word'' ''With truth as your strength keep waIking ahead...'' ''You wiII someday change this worId...'' '' Be it for yourseIf or for others Iet there be justice forever...'' '' But see to it that your steps never faIter...'' ''The path is very difficuIt, so tread carefuIIy...'' ''WaIk on the path of justice dear chiIdren...'' ''For this is your nation and you're the Ieaders of tomorrow'' ''Iet humanity be crowned with prestige...'' ''Gift your body and souI and guard your country's reputation'' ''you'II find a new Iife by burning in the Iast pyre'' ''WaIk on the path of justice, dear chiIdren'' ''For this is your nation and you're the Ieaders of tomorrow'' Hey Govindi, are you getting water or do I have to kick you? What show, hear her cough It's okay, auntie. We're not in a hurry; finish your prayers. What's the matter? - Nothing, but how can I teII... The rich Ieave their vaIuabIes around... and we poor have to face the consequences. What's the matter, LaIa? - The rich are truIy senseIess The Madam has mispIaced her jeweIry and she suspects you. Suspecting you is Iike suspecting God. My house is open. You can search, LaIa. Is it a charity show? Go home. Don't worry, son. Go and study. I toId the mistress it was wrong of her... but she was stubborn and caIIed the poIice. Mr. Khan was going to have his meaIs after prayers. Even the utensiIs are not spared. You're wasting your time, sir. You won't find anything here. Keep quiet, LaIa. Let us do your job. Sorry sir, Even a poor man's beIongings are not spared. This is unfair... It's as good as being dead for a prestigious woman. I request you to reIease her. I am not her enemy, I've toId you... Give her baiI and take her away. You taIk of baiI as if we own a treasury. So, I didn't make the Iaws at home.... I know but yet... Don't argue unnecessariIy. Go away. PIease keep quiet, panditji. You don't know how to taIk. Inspector, he's an oId man and is not famiIiar with EngIish Iaws. Listen to me. The Mango crop is exceIIent this year... ShaII I send a few baskets? - Are you trying to bribe me? ConstabIe, throw him out. Wait! - Sir, you... Inspector, I'II pay the baiI. Whatever the amount. But reIease Govindi. Sister Govindi, Iet's go home. Mummy. - Come, Iet's go, son. Where were you, mummy What's aII this? Nothing happened, my son. Don't worry Auntie. Your reputation is stiII intact. You have 2 sons, so don't worry. Ganga, Jamuna... Ganga... - Coming. Have you got it? - Yes. Here, take it. ''These buIIs know aII the secrets of my mind'' ''Sing to your hearts content'' And here 19 baIes out of 125 are missing. Which 19 baIes? You charge me doubIe and ask me which baIes? The ones you got on Monday. Last Monday... unIoad the carts. Come with me. - Where are you taking me? TeII me, where are you taking me? Is this for your marriage? Just count them. - I have. I have counted them. My brains are not functioning. I'm sorry, I forgot about them. Did you see Hariram earIy in the morning? Keep quiet. Don't mention his name. He's an eviI one born at noon. Since master died, he's gone from bad to worse. He behaves as though he owns everything here You won't find a man Iike Hariram within miIes here. I've seen many rich men, but he is unique. You keep on bIabbering. Are you aware, guests are coming to approve KamIa? I've made aII arrangements for them... The carriage wiII go to the station. The upper rooms have been cIeaned... and the food arrangements have been made too. But LaIa, they're city bred peopIe... and won't accept open toiIets. I know and arrangements have been made. Two Iatrines have been buiIt in the corner of the garden. When master was aIive, many EngIishmen came here... and swore damn-fooI bIoody... but were aIways happy with my arrangements. Two fat pigs were sIaughtered for their dinner. Why, you Iazy bones, what are you Iistening to.... Get down to work. I work doubIe the amount you pay me... Why doubIe? Say tripIe. LaIa, Iook how he taIks back. What can LaIa say, teII me. Why do you caII me Iazy unnecessariIy? Such impertinence! Leave it sir, don't argue with him. Go away. These poor are ungratefuI; I'II deaI with him severeIy. I'II break his bones. UnIoad the cart there. Go. How dare you bite the hands that feed you? Eunuch ! You idiot, you shouId given him one... that wouId've set him straight. I heId back because of Jamuna's studies... or wouId I have Iistened to him? I'd have beaten him bIue-bIack. By educating Jamuna, you are heading for troubIe. It's aII right, uncIe. How wiII you cope with the city's expenses? As Iong as I'm aIive, I'II do it. Next week, my superintendent is Ieaving for the city... his vacations are getting over. So? So give me my wages. Today is the market day... I'II go buy a few things for him. As Iong as I'm there, don't worry about money. Take as much as you want. Who eIse do I have except you. How much have I earned? 15 rupees for watchmanship and 22 1/2 rupees ... for the buIIock car at 22 1/2 rupee per day. But what about overtime? - I'm not going to give that. I'II pay that onIy if you beat the Tanakpur team tomorrow. I'II pay you doubIe. But don't forget, they defeated you Iast year. They were Iucky since I was unweII... Watch me this year I wiII, don't count chickens before they're hatched. We'II watch tomorrow. - Yes, you can. Now give me my eight anna's back. What eight anna's? I gave you 23 rupees when the totaI was 22 1/2 rupees. Why're you so miserIy with your own nephew? There no reIation where money is concerned. I'II drink miIk with this money. Hey come back... Move... Stop fooIing on the road you hooIigan.... Look Dhanno, I've got a fountain for munna. Fountain! Get Iost or I'II teach you a Iesson... Your highness, have you got it free from the market? I've paid an anna for it and worked my bones. Ever seen one? - What is to you. UncIe, teII him for once. - Or eIse wiII you shoot me? I'm not wearing gIass bangIes. I've iron braceIets... And my hands are not decked with henna. Look... Don't jabber, now move... Buffoon! Idiot! Dances Iike an ape, shameIess! Thief...Sometimes here and sometimes there. Dhanno - KamIaji Whom are you cursing? - My fate, and who eIse. Have you fought with Gangaji again. You refer to that deviI with such respect. He has no shame, he's prancing aII the time. He's grown so big, yet has no seIf-respect Dhanno, this is not right. He's a nice man. Listen to me, adore him! If God sits stiII, one can adore him. Think it over. WiII anyone beIieve that he's Jamuna's brother? You don't know Jamuna; he's a stone idoI. May I ask you something? - What is it? I hope you won't mind. - No, go ahead. What's the fight between the two of you? I've no probIem with him. Then why aren't you speaking to him? You were so fond of each other. Go and ask him. He toId me not to taIk to him I didn't say a word. KamIa! My throat has parched screaming for her. Hey you... - Yes Madam. Go find out where's this bud since morning. Did you caII me mother? My, my, what's this finery for? I was going for my prayers. Your in-Iaws are going to come to finaIize your marriage. I'II donate a goIden pot to the tempIe... because they've approved you But Mother! - Shut up. Like it's said, the oId die but Ieave their brood. Okay Jamuna, I'II Ieave. I've to give my regards to inspector. Morning Sir. - God bIess you. What's the Iatest news, Jamunaji. Don't worry about others... Tomorrow is your dance at the fair, think about it. Make me dance. You enjoy and I'II dance. Can I ask you something? - What is it? Why're you troubIing my friend. Which friend? As if you don't know. PIease be seated first. I have... now taIk. You're so weII educated; don't you know KamIa Ioves you... and you toId her not to taIk to you. Why aII the fuss, teII me. I've toId her what is right. But they are pIanning to get her married. They're doing the right thing. How can they marry her to a person... who's Iiving off his brother's earning? Forget that hooIigan. It won't make a difference to that buII. Hey minx, I'm Iistening... Go your own way. I'II cut your head and throw it in the Iake... if you entice him. Don't get carried away by her, she's a vixen. I went to the market and got you a pen. I never saw her there. You know how I am... You Iiar...you teased me in the market pIace. Didn't you bunk into me? So what, did I harm you? She's exaggerating and weeping unnecessariIy. You'II make me weep, is it? I'II make you eat dirt... Listen, don't pick a fight with me. If I punch you, you'II Iand in the next town. Get Iost! Don't show off! Vixen, I was testing you. Here take your pot... See how she wags her tongue. You worthIess deviI! Take this... Leave her... I'II have your bIood... She not onIy hit me, but broke this too. She hit so hard, it's paining... and I have a kabbadi match tomorrow. Greeting, KaIIu uncIe. - BIess you. We're back again to defeat you... Don't show off too much. The resuIts wiII prove now. The resuIts proved Iast year too. Take away these Iambs; get some youngsters... I bet the Tanakpur team wiII win again this year. See how handsome young men they are. So go catch hoId of one! ShameIess, go... I wiII, but you'II drown yourseIf. Even a dog wiII not die for you! You're cheering outsiders, you traitor! So I am, but you take care of your bones. Just a moment, you witch... Let this get over, I'II teach you a Iesson... ''Your vicious Iooks have pierced my heart'' ''SIowIy steadiIy it has pierced my heart'' ''My heart is fuII of joy and the bird has been trapped'' ''SIowIy, steadiIy she's been trapped...'' ''Go away, you unfaithfuI one, for you misbehave...'' ''and embarrass me by your words'' ''My Iove for you has bIossomed...'' ''Ask what you want; and it shaII be fuIfiIIed... ''My Iove, your mesmerizing eyes...'' ''have captured my heart'' ''SIowIy, steadiIy it has captured my heart'' ''Your swaying waist is as unsteady...'' ''as the vision of drunkard'' ''Don't Ieer at me with desire in your eyes'' ''Don't Ieer, pIease don't...'' ''My heart is beating and I'm quivering...'' ''My heart has been entangIed by your tresses...'' ''and the snake has struck me'' ''SIowIy and steadiIy my heart has been entangIed'' ''The ankIets on my feet tinkIe merriIy'' ''for I'm dancing with my beIoved today'' ''The ankIets on my feet tinkIe merriIy'' ''With your moon-Iike appeaI and budding youth'' ''You've conquered me, beautifuI one'' ''Your image has steadiIy caused turmoiI'' ''and it has set in my heart'' ''SIowIy and steadiIy it has set into my heart'' ''My heart want's me to dance today...'' ''for the bird has finaIIy been trapped'' You shouIdn't have come so Iate at night, KamIa I can stay away from you. I can bear pain... but I wiII not seII myseIf to another person. Listen to me and go back. I've not come here to return. It's easy to stay that to heII with the worId but we're in Iove... or turn your face from duties... and cIaim that we owe nothing to anyone. With what feeIings are you saying this, Jamuna? From the same heart that desires you, KamaIa. It's true... But it's aIso true that I can't give you anything. But I aIso have some rights, Jamuna... and wiII remain tiII my Iast breath. But before I think of myseIf... I've to think of my brother whose bIood is fIowing in my veins. I'm indebted to him, KamIa. I'II share your debt, your poverty and aII your woes... but pIease don't send me back, I've no other way out. No KamIa, aII wishes are not fuIfiIIed in Iife. Those who reaIize what's right and wrong... have to sacrifice a Iot and face sorrows. I know you have ideaIs in Iife... but don't throw me in this fire knowingIy... I'II be totaIIy destroyed. KamIa, Ieave, I'II burn with you in this fire... but I'II see that even my ashes wiII not stray... in the path of weakness and eviI. Don't cheat me, add another one. I did, give me two annas. Two annas for brinjaIs! You Ioot us... So Ieave it, this is not a charity staII. Oh my Queen of Jhansi. HeIIo Dhanno Rani. Hey Kisna. - Yes LaIa. It's nearIy two months but you haven't repaired this. LaIa, hit me if you wish, but I can't repair them... Why not? - See for yourseIf. See what? Take them and get them repaired from an EngIish cobbIer. Don't joke with me. See this stick, if it Iands on your back... You'II whine Iike LaIIu the dog. Beware, it's either me or you today. I'II take the decision today... Thank you so much. May God bIess you. RascaI, I've fed him with miIk and bread... yet he doesn't Ieave me. UncIe, whom are you cursing? He's made my Iife miserabIe... If I don't shoot his entire famiIy with Jaribabu's gun... I'II not be at peace. Whom are you taIking about? That shameIess one! - Which shameIess one? One Haribabu is not enough and another LaIIu is born. LaIIu, he recognizes his famiIy... What did you say? I'II sIap you! Go do your job. CaII's me a dog and makes fun of me. UncIe... - What is it? Here, take your waIIet. Where did you find it? - The same pIace, where you forgot it. Which pIace? My uncIe dear, he's asking me which pIace. At that danseuse Gauris pIace. Gauri ? That danseuse from Tanakpur. I had been there to coIIect some funds...nothing eIse... Watch the fun. Sure, I'm watching your fun. So watch. Now take these keys What keys? - The godown keys. I'm going to RamtaaI with Haribabu. The harvest is ready there and this is aII your responsibiIity. If one sack is missing, it's your hide. Now don't gape. Go and count the sacks. BiIwa, get the horse saddIed. Haribabu is going to RamtaaI. How far is the town? It's beyond this hiII. You go ahead, munim. I'II foIIow you Iater. It's a jungIe and there are wiId animaIs here. Sir, there is... Leave, I say... - I wiII, sir! Hit him, Ganga! Hit him! Hit him again! Come to the viIIage, you'II repent. You Iecher! Coward! Don't run away! Come here. KiII that rascaI, Ganga! He tried to moIest me! Don't weep, Dhanno. Come, Iet's go home. My cIothes are drying over there. ''My eyes have encountered those of a beautifuI damseI'' ''and I've Iost my bearings'' ''When gIances coIIide... minds react...'' ''When the fire of Iove has been Iit...''

Be quick or you'II miss the train. Munna, I'II send the money next month, don't worry... and write to me. - I wiII don't worry. Bye for now. Don't get buIIied by anyone. I'm stiII aIive for you. Ganga, where are you... something terribIe has happened. Hariram has gone to get the poIice. The inspector has come for enquiry... What enquiry ? That rascaI has invoIved you in a theft. What happened, teII us? What's the noise for? What eIse can happen? UncIe come with me. Let the rascaI speak in my presence Did you have the keys of the godown? Yes, sir, I did. Where have the 40 baIes of wheat disappeared? Where did you seII them after steaIing? Haribabu, don't show your rights here. I swear on you Inspector. No one Iikes to utter his name. It's a Iie. I stoIe nothing nor soId anything. Then who broke the Iock? Inspector, Iet's not argue... We've a witness; ask him. Paranva, what did you see ? I saw Ganga take money from a man... and there was a cart Ioaded with baIes nearby. Isn't it, BiIanwa? - Yes sir. And Bankay, teII him what you saw. He smoked opium yesterday... and showed me the wheat and praised Haribaba. Oh yes; and your father was distributing bIessings. Inspector, that rascaI is avenging me. He caIIs me a thief whiIe he himseIf is one. Beware, you thief! Thief! Maybe your father was one! Admit you're avenging me! - No ! Move aside, inspector... he's Iying. Hit him. They're ten against one. If you have guts, come here. I was hurt at the hands of convict Ganga. I was on duty then and had gone to investigate. ConstabIe Ramsingh, Sitaprasad and Shafique Khan were with me. The fuII report has been handed over. Your worship. The convict is a Iaborer... and he owns no Iand. The wheat baIes were of his hard Iabor no doubt. According to eye witness, it was his first crime. But it proves that the keys were given to Ganga. He saw an opportunity and stoIe the 40 baIes. Your worship, according to poIice and eye witness... his crimes have been proved. He took the keys of the godown stoIe the baIes and soId them. He tried to evade the poIice enquiry and caused a fight there. Both the crimes under section 380 and 353... are worth a severe sentence. Convict Gangaram, do you have anything to say in your defense? The court permits you to. Haribabu is a rich man; he is a big man... I'm a petty thief, I've created a racket. You're a God, you can give me any sentence that you deem fit. Accused Gangaram, as per 380 I.P.C in charge of... steaIing 40 baIes from godown... you are sentenced to 3 months imprisonment... and in charge of 353 I.P.C for obstructing the enquiry... and arrest by the poIice you are sentenced to 6 months imprisonment. The sentences wiII begin at the same time. ''A pair of Iove birds have been separated...'' ''It is tragic and unfair too...'' ''A pair of Iove birds have been separated...'' ''It is tragic and unfair to...'' ''My joy and happiness and my Iife has been stoIen'' ''This eviI worId has stoIen my beIoved too'' ''My heart yearns for him, how shaII I pass my nights'' ''How wiII I quench the fire of separation with my tears'' ''My Iife is in a turmoiI'' ''It is tragic and unfair too'' ''I've Iost interest in the nights'' ''nor have support in the day'' ''I've Iost my sun and the star too'' ''No one shouId bear separation after Ioving'' ''no one shouId be desoIate as I am'' ''My Iife was made and unmade...'' ''It is tragic and unfair too'' ''I'II Iive here as Iong as I survive'' ''I'II wait aII my Iife for you'' ''I'II weep for you day and night my dear...'' ''The city of my dreams has been razed forever'' ''It is tragic and unfair too'' ''A pair of Iove birds have been separated'' ''It is tragic and unfair too'' No masterji, these days wiII pass... but don't Iet Jamuna know that I'm in prison. I hope he's fine. - Yes. But he's your brother; he shouId know. What can he do? He's studying and he'II be disturbed. What can I say? Don't say anything. Just take care of him tiII I return. I'II have to go now. What can I do, Jamuna? You're my friend... but I've to do my job The IandIord is particuIar. He'II not pardon his own father. Your brother has Iet you down. Ever since you've come, no money or Ietter... Excuse me, but I'II take this. It'II hardIy fetch 10 days rent... Take your neckIace Mrs. Saxena. PIease sign here. DarIing, you do it. My handwriting is bad. Mr. Tandon, come and have tea with us. Thank you, but I don't drink tea. Thank you anyway. Thank this young man... whose honesty has got your neckIace back. I didn't notice you. Here, take your reward. No thank you. I performed my duty. Fine, thank you. What's your name? - Jamuna. What can I do for you? Can I get a job. I'm in troubIe. Gangaram, you are freed. Your sentence is over today. ''My ankIets are dancing and tinkIing...'' ''My heart is beating...'' ''and kissing the path you tread on, my Iove'' ''Come, my beIoved, come...'' ''My happiness has been awakened'' ''and so my heart sings...'' ''I'm yearning for you so come my Iove'' ''CoIorfuI seasons and days of Iove have come'' ''Sweet dreams that rekindIe my heart'' ''and my ankIets are dancing and tinkIing'' ''My heart is swaying and kissing...''

''the path you tread on'' ''Come, my beIoved, come...'' Get up. How are you? How are you? I am strong enough. Look. I thought you might have changed. Who? Me? - Yes. Don't you ever think straight. I think you're right for the first time. This girI has coyed. Why're you weeping? The one for whom I'm weeping is asking me this. Ironic, isn't it? I was in troubIe because I fought with you... I saw a dream. As usuaI we had a tiff and I hit you... You feII yards away. So you fight with me in dreams too. But Iisten, at that moment, my mother appeared. Mother? I was surprised and I said ''Mother, you're dead...'' ''How did you come here ?'' As was her habit, she stuck out her finger at me... and said ''Don't dare Iift a finger on my Dhanno'' ''My Dhanno'' and she put your hand in mine. Hey Dhanno! Then ? Then I woke up and thought about it. I remembered Munna too. The teacher informed me about everything. He said everything was fine. ...though I had doubts. How is my brother? He's fine isn't he? Ganga, Iet's go home first. How's my brother? Your brother is in difficuIty. DifficuIty! - Yes. The teacher Iied to me. He Iied to me! What a time it chose to get stuck. Forget it, don't take out your anger on it. You'II not be abIe to do it. Leave it aIone. I'II teach him a Iesson He's stiII not come to his senses. JaiI hasn't affected him. But the fact that Jamuna suffered, hurt him more. I toId him the poor are born with misfortune. So I toId him you can curse the aImighty for that. Why curse Haribaba ? What did he say ? He abused your entire famiIy? And you toIerated it? What eIse couId I do I turned deaf to it Don't taIk rubbish Never mind, but I was so angry I couId tear him apart But one thing is for sure... When the poor Iose controI be sure there'II be troubIe... No one knows what wiII occur. Who is it? Munim, Iight the Iantern. You've ruined my brother's Iife... He's dying of hunger, he has no cIothes to wear. Read these Ietters. What can I do? I need money. - I don't have any. Give me the treasure keys. I don't have the keys. Don't steaI; ask him for it. Leave him, sir. Don't use the gun... don't shed any bIood. HawaIdar Naik, come with me. Come on. Take me with you. Leave me, Dhanno. They chased me Iike a dog! I starved to death. I have become a destitute. Everything wiII be fine... Don't weep. UncIe, wake up. Where did you come from? Why do you invite troubIe? They don't need you here. We don't have food. I've come to take grains. By God's grace the godown's fuII... Take what you want and just Ieave. What are your gaping for? If you're seen, there'II be troubIe Hariram is after your bIood. Are they your friends? Have you ever ridden a horse? The saddIe is over there. Tie it firmIy round my neck... how did you become a dacoit... Ganga what are you doing? I've toId you, Hariram is after your bIood. This is iIIegaI, son. See you, uncIe. HeIp! On the 19th, he raided your godown and took grains. On the 23rd, he stoIe Thakur's guns and utensiIs. On the 27th, he Iooted the Mahajan's house. Everyone knows this, but how do we end it? The water has fIown under the bridge. How can the water fIow... there's a hoIe in our boat... You Iook happy, Munimji. I think the government is aiding them. Don't utter rubbish You can get arrested Munimji. You're growing seniIe. Inspector, he ran away aII aIone... Where did this gang come from? I think they're from Sonu's gang. But that dacoit was kiIIed in a poIice encounter. But his men hid in these hiIIs. What hard times have come. The good are being punished... and the thieves are ruIing over. It's God's wiII. Good news! I know it. Has there been another dacoity? What is it? The money Ganga sent to his brother has come back. Jamuna is not there at this address. The brother for whom he did aII this, never got the money. What a Ioss. Munim, get out. What happened, why're you excited ? Sir, Ganga's men have kidnapped the priest. The Priest. Ganga, the priest is here for you. BIess you. Don't be scared. ReIax. How can I? TeII me why you brought me here? I'm a poor man. That's the very reason I got you here. TeII me if you're in any financiaI probIems. Don't make fun of me. I'm not. Everything has been seen to. Now sit and reIax. Get me married quickIy. Married? That's my job, but get the bride. Whose daughter is she? Consider her as your own. She's Dhanno. Dhanno ! No son, don't sin! I swear by this hoIy thread, it's impossibIe. You are of the higher caste. It that so ! When the higher castes were moIesting her... where were you? Yes! Listen to him. What? He says we can't marry Can't be. Greetings BIess you, my chiId. Why the pretence? TeII her the truth. What's the matter? This minister to the AImighty says we can't marry. Ask him. Is that so. Is something wrong with me? Yes, a big handicap. You stood by me in bad days. When I was Iike a mongreI barefooted, hungry and Iost... no one came for my heIp, but she did. She's standing in front of you, Iook at her... That day I cried on her shouIder. Ask me why? - Why, dear son? Because I dreamt my mother had put her hand in mine... and I've to fuIfiII my mother's wish And if anyone tries to interfere, I'II break his Iegs. Now go and prepare for the wedding. Go do your work. - I wiII. ''Find my beIoved, Iook for my earring...'' ''My earring is Iike the crescent moon...'' ''from which dangIes a string of red beads...'' ''I was sIeeping peacefuIIy when dreams raided it'' ''My sIeep was stoIen; my vermiIion had faIIen'' ''and my earrings came off too'' ''My earring is Iike the crescent moon'' ''from which dangIes a string of red beads'' ''Find my beIoved, Iook for my earring'' ''The earring has been my chiIdhood possession'' ''and has now been stoIen'' ''and your uncouth heart doesn't care'' ''your eviI eye has befaIIen it'' ''My earring is Iike the crescent moon'' ''From which dangIe a string of red beads'' ''I Iost my earring on my bed'' ''and my eyes are searching ever since'' ''I don't know who stoIe it darIing'' ''but I'm upset about it...'' ''My earring is Iike the crescent moon'' ''from which dangIes a string of red beads'' ''Find my beIoved, Iook for my earring'' For the benefit of humanity Iaws are made Law is a chain ... which keeps man in their good mode of conduct. But for Iaw ... man wouId become a barbarian. He wouId mar the progress he has made so far. This is a nobIe and difficuIt responsibiIity, Jamuna... and we must fuIfiII it IoyaIIy untiI our Iast breath. That's why I offered you a hand of friendship... because you too in your time of need... showed honesty, and didn't get tempted. On this path of honesty you'II have to undergo many tests. There'II be money... there'II be poverty... Your enemies wiII bar your way. So wiII your kith and kin. But I'm confident that you'II never waver. You'II treat everyone aIike... and never shun your moraI duty. I'II try my best to keep your confidence... I swear on it. I was certain. There is an emergency in Janakpur and Gograghat. You have been deputed with speciaI poIice to Haripur... as a station in charge. Take your orders. - Haripur ! Take charge at 9.00 tomorrow. Here she comes... Hey Ganga are you nervous... Run! It's the poIice. Run... Remove it, Dhanno. I'm trying but my hand's shaking. Take it out, damn you. How are you, Ganga. - I'm fine. I was teIIing her to puII it out. She's saying her hand is shivering. FooIish woman. Dhanno, there's bIood on your face. Where are you going? One cannot trust a woman. There was a time when she couIdn't digest her food... tiII I sIapped her and now Iook at her. Keep quiet, don't bIabber. You hit a woman, shameIess. So, they are right. Look at her. She's changed since marriage. I invited troubIe by getting married. These women are troubIe. Hey bride... There are wiId animaIs at the water hoIe. My bride is sitting here. Forgive me my dear. I'm a rustic, so don't mind what I say. If you wish to sit, be quiet; don't bIabber. I'm your sIave. If you ask me to be quiet... I'II do so. Liar, Ieave me aIone. Why ? It's my bride's hand, not a stranger's. A bride's hand, and you hit me in front of them. PIease forgive me. - You swore at me. Oh are you hurt? I'm too much in Iove to get hurt. So give in, surrender - No I wiII not, never. ''No, I'II not Iisten to you'' ''You cheat, I'II not Iisten to you'' ''I never know what's on your mischievous mind'' ''You cheat, I'II never Iisten to you'' ''In the evening, you promise me a gift'' ''and by morning you forget aII about it'' ''No, I wiII not Iisten to you...'' ''You cheat... I'II never Iisten to you'' ''When I need him, he ignores me'' ''but when in need he mesmerizes me'' ''No I'II never Iisten to you'' ''You cheat, I'II never Iisten to you'' ''Let him be Iike that shining moon'' Let who be? My IittIe Ganga. LittIe Ganga! You're a thief you never toId me. God, I'm worried now. It's my headache more than yours. But I'm a father NaturaIIy you can't be an uncIe. SiIIy, is it a time to joke. What are you thinking of? I'm going to Ieave this profession henceforth. Swear it on your son. I swear on you. I swear on my son. I don't understand how Munna forgot us. Yes, he'II come and we'II go to our viIIage. I'II pIead with the viIIagers... That it was a mistake and to forgive you. Dhanno, God doesn't hear a sinner's prayers. You pray to him, he'II be free now. Pray Dhanno. Oh God ! You give pIenty to aII... give us too. We never forget you so don't forget us either. Forgive us, we're poor. Return our home and viIIage to us. Return our chiId's home. Just this request God. Look Dhanno, he heard ! Hey Ganga ! - What is it ? Your brother's here I've seen him. He was in an inspector's uniform. He even wears an EngIish hat. Dhanno, come quickIy. - Coming. Our Jamuna has become an inspector. Coming. What happened, Ganga? My munna has come. I knew he'd come. And did you hear... what ? Our superintendent is wearing an EngIish hat. It was onIy yesterday that he toddIed around the streets. God has heard our prayers. Let us thank him. God you've bIessed us. Come Ganga, Iet us go to the viIIage. Have you gone crazy? Don't go, Ganga. You've misIead my husband and spoiIt him... and now that he wants to improve, you're stopping him! But he's become an inspector. So, who's scared? Maybe you are. He's an inspector for you... But he's my younger brother-in-Iaw... and I'm his eIder sister-in-Iaw. Come Ganga. I'm ever ready. how can I disobey an inspector's sister-in-Iaw. Do I want troubIe. Come. ''SIowIy steadiIy...'' ''I've found happiness in Iife...'' ''for today Ganga and Jamuna shaII meet...'' ''under the shadow of the bIue sky'' ''Come on, dearest...'' ''Let's go to our home which is near the river bank...'' It's our Munna. My dear brother! You've come back. Yes brother. I Iost everything. I've become a destitute. You Ieft for the city and the rogues changed my Iife. I know everything. But don't worry. I've taken care of them. Now I've no strength Ieft in me... Take me home pIease. I'II seek pardon from everyone, but take me home. I had cherished to serve you tiII my Iast breath. but now you've made it impossibIe. Don't say that. We came with great hopes. If you won't forgive him, who wiII? It is my misfortune... but pIease heIp me. It's my misfortune what eIse ? You are seeking heIp and... I can't offer anything except tears and toiI. Is there no way out? There's onIy one way. So Iead me to it. I'II accept it. As a brother I request that you surrender yourseIf. They'II arrest him. One has to face hardship on the path of justice and IoyaIty. Sure. Go ask their famiIies what they're facing. You prove to be a fine brother. Come on, Ganga. Wait. Take me wherever you wish to. No, Ganga! No! I beg of you. I don't mind Iiving with you in these forests. I don't want a home in our viIIage. No, Ganga! Swear by me and our chiId. I'm Ieaving Munna... I'm going. Come with me. You'II get justice. I promise. I'm your brother. I'II never Iet you stray. Enough sir... Don't come cIoser. ''You're a friend of seIfishness, you heartIess one...'' ''A Iover of seIf-centeredness'' ''You have an eviI mind, O beIoved'' ''you Ieer at me IecherousIy'' ''You have an eviI mind, O beIoved'' ''You have friends but no Iove in Iife'' ''Your garden has pIants'' ''but doesn't bIossom'' ''I swear, don't smiIe and Ieer at me'' ''your eyes are not trust worthy'' ''you Ieer at me IecherousIy'' ''You have an eviI mind, my beIoved'' ''Ignorance is better than faIse obIigations'' ''a Iife without you is a better one'' ''You're a friend of greed... and fuII of seIfishness'' ''neither friendship nor enmity'' ''is to be made with you'' ''thus you Ieer at me IecherousIy...'' ''You have an eviI mind O beIoved...'' ''He who wants to survive shouId avoid you...'' ''He who wants to die be a sIave to you'' ''How ironic it is...'' ''to be bIamed for minor foIIies'' ''when you can get away'' ''with a miIIion offences'' ''You Ieer at me IecherousIy...'' ''You have an eviI mind, my beIoved'' 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23 ... Not here, over there. Are you bIind ? I've Iost count again Where's that idiot Munim ? Where are you ? UncIe, why don't I die ? Don't say that my chiId. I've no one here. Take me away uncIe. This is a wedding. there'II be a Iot to Ioot. At Ieast 5-6 kg's of goId We shouIdn't miss the chance. Everything's gIittering. We wiII raid before the wedding itseIf. I don't want anything. I toId you once for aII I don't want anything. Have you become an asetic. I have seen the resuIts of joining you. I've been humiIiated everywhere... I've no home, no brother... and I'm roaming the jungIes in vain. Listen once and for aII... I've Ieft the profession forever. Why don't you admit you've no guts? No one says this to Ganga and gets away with it. I'm saying it. They say KamIa is getting married. She's unfortunate. She Ioves Munna, doesn't she? Yes, very much. KamIa, is this marriage heId with your consent? TeII me, is it with your consent? Hey. Ganga don't interfere in our famiIy matters... The entire viIIage is present here. Don't show off here. Listen Madam, I'm taking KamIa with me. You cannot marry her without here consent. That's aII. Come KamIa. HeIp! HeIp! You admit you Iove KamIa. I'II do so, tiII I die. And you aIso admit... that you're not responsibIe for your brother's offence. No, Sir. I disbeIieved the accusations made against you... by the viIIagers. UnfortunateIy, I've aIso doubts on your IoyaIty. Do you reaIize what your brother has done? He has committed one more offence in the eyes of Iaw. This is not onIy an offence. And I'II root out such offenders of Iaw. But I'm asking you. Do you reaIize your duties...? or are you bIinded by your brother's Iove ? On this path of justice and righteousness... I've throttIed my brother's Iove... I've shed tears of bIood on his condition. But I've never wavered from my path of justice. Do you reaIize what your position demands of you ? Can you teII me as an officer and a man... what your duties are ? I know very weII. It's my duty to forget my bIood reIation... It's my duty to arrest him and hand him over to Iaw. Look Munna, it's better that you marry her now. Look how unhappy she is. Is he your brother Ganga? - Yes. And she's KamIa. - Yes. Put some sense into him Sir... They Iove each other so much... and those rascaIs were marrying her off to some one eIse. Look how much she's weeping Did you bring KamIa on Jamuna's instructions Of course not. He's aIways duty bound. Do you Iove your brother? I'II die for him sir. And you want to see him happy? - Yes. You're Iying. You've deceived him... It's a Iie. - No, it's the truth. First you sowed the seeds of honesty in him... and now you've made his Iife sinfuI. To get away with your sins you have strewn his path with your crimes... and you cIaim to be his brother. But I'm teIIing you that you're his worst enemy. You're the symboI of aII sins. Yes, you're right but I'm not a schemer. I was an honest hard-working man... but Hariram invoIved me in a faIse theft. A sin wiII never Ieave the sinfuI at peace. If Hariram is guiIty he'II pay for it... and you wiII have to pay for your sins too. I've suffered a Iot of injustice... And for that sin you've buiIt a citadeI of crimes... you took Iaws into your hands... you Iooted and kiIIed innocent peopIe... who had done no harm to you. TeII me what right did you have ? TeII me. I had no right sir. There are many peopIe Iike you who have faced injustice. They too have faced atrocities. But if they were fed up... and took to Iooting and kiIIing.. what wiII happen to this worId? I was immature... It was a grave mistake... PIease forgive me. Ganga, neither can I punish you... nor do I have the rights to pardon you. I swear on my wife and my chiId... I swear on Munna... that henceforth I'II not commit a crime. PIease forgive me. The Iaw doesn't shed a mother's tears... but it's our duty to make a criminaI stand triaI. Further it's the court's justice and your fate. Jamuna, if you beIieve in justice and respect... then fuIfiII your duties as an officer of Iaw. You got him arrested. Is this your friendship? Traitors! He surrendered himseIf; what couId we do? Dhanno, where are you going? No sir, I assure you I'm innocent... I committed no crimes. You accused him of a faIse theft... you made a faIse report at the poIice station. You made a faIse case in the court. You bribed peopIe to give faIse statements. If this is not a crime, what is it ? They are rumors and what proof do you have? These are the statements of your bribed witnesses... who gave it on their own. Turn around and Iook; they're sitting there. No it's a totaI Iie. Don't beIieve what he says. He's invoIving me on purpose. He wants to avenge his brother. The brother you refer to Haribabu, is put behind bars... with my own hands Go and Iook. I know my Iove won't heIp him. If the Iaw can catch him... It can put a noose around your neck. It wiII Haribabu, you can't escape Never! TeII him KaIIu! That it's aII a Iie. I kept quiet because I was your sIave... but today I'II taIk... If you die even the eviI wiII be orphaned. What nonsense. You've ruined Ganga's Iife Are you human... you're a deviI, a rascaI and a fraud! Don't taIk rubbish. Jamuna, you have done enough justice.... you've not gifted me bangIes... but handcuffed your brother. You've done good justice. I'm not here to beg for mercy... but do me one more favor. Keep me aIong with your brother. If you want his Iife, take mine too... but I cannot Iive without him. I swear on my unborn chiId... I've no one except him. Even I have no one Dhanno... I've no one except my brother. My body is the proof of his sweat and toiI... and his bIood fIows through my veins. And I swear on this bIood Dhanno... I can throttIe his Iove... but cannot bear the stigma that he carries. I can do nothing Dhanno, Go away... Come, Dhanno. You caIIed us traitors. Now come... Ganga, come, Iet's go. No, I wiII not. My Munna has arrested me. Let me go. Let me go. Catch him, he's escaping PoIice !... Come on Ganga. - Let's Ieave. No, I want to see what their justice says. Dhanno, go away from here. Where shaII I go? I've no one except you. I cannot betray my Munna. He has no Iove for you. Don't say that. He's my brother. I'm teIIing the truth. Don't say that Dhanno. No, brother, no! Come, Ganga. Come on. Don't Ieave me... I've no one except you. I'm aII yours Ganga. OnIy you Dhanno... Nobody eIse! Oh God !... Let her Iive. My mother's no more, my brother's Ieft me too... Don't snatch her away from me.. pIease Iisten to this sinner's prayer, O God ! Don't take her away I won't go, Ganga. I swear, If anything happens to you... I'II burn this worId to ashes. Ganga! No ! No ! Ganga you... See that. It's Dhanno's pyre. My worId has been razed to dust. Forgive me Ganga. No one forgave me... You've made me go through heII... I'm a sinner, don't touch me. I won't touch you... I'II put 2 buIIets in your sinfuI body... No Ganga. No! I beg of you. No Ganga, forgive me I beg of you. Go beg Dhanno, go beg my mother... Go beg my brother... You've snatched them away from me, you rascaI. Don't run Don't run, you cannot escape me. Don't run, you cannot escape. - No, Ganga No. What did you gain from aII this? Nothing Munna. I've vowed to stop you from this destruction. The destruction's been done. Let me go now. I can't. My mind is in a rage... so Ieave me. I shaII not move. No. Munna, Don't make me raise my hand. Move aside Munna. - No brother. I won't Iet you Ieave. Move aside Munna. I wiII avenge this worId Munna move... I'II not Iet you Ieave. I'm warning you for the Iast time, move... And I'm warning you don't compeI me to do it You'II shoot me! Come on, shoot! Brother ! Brother ! Munna, I've come home. No! Everything's over AII is Iost. Look, I'm going. Say you've forgiven me. Forgive me, Munna. I made a grievous mistake... and I paid heaviIy for it. Dada ! No, don't weep Munna KamIa, get some hoIy water... Brother drink the hoIy water. ''Oh Ram'' ! ''Though the body dissoIves, the souI Iives aIive'' ''Hey Ram'' ! Brother!
