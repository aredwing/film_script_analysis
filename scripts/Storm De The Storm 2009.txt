Above the northern and western parts of the North Sea... ...there's a severe storm between north-west and north. The storm is spreading to the southern and eastern part of the North Sea. The storm is expected to last all night. As a result, at 5:30 pm, the regions Rotterdam... ...Willemstad and Bergen op Zoom were warned... ...to expect dangerously high water levels. THE STORM Oosterkerke, 31 January 1953 Julia, I don't have anything to wear. I'm going like this. -No. -I am. Julia, You can't! Wear this. You really don't have anything I can wear? -Well. Is that better? -It is. May I wear this? -Can I borrow this? -Very well. Little Ernest... ...did it wake you? You want Mum? Here's Mum. I feel like dancing. -You won't forget to feed her at eight? -Make sure you're home on time. Julia, really! Henny's coming at 8:30. -If you're not back, I'll leave. -It's no weather for a party. Father wants you to stay home. We won't blow away. We're not candyfloss. It's awful out. It's not just that... Emma, 8:30 remember? -Can't we give her a lift? -No. Brass Band - 25th Anniversary Very unseemly! It's party time! Go on, say it! You're a whore! -That's no name for a dog: "Gouda"? -Yes, Gouda. Just watch! Just watch this. Sausage... Cheese. You see? Gouda! -Sorry. -What's the use of that? -I'll take it to the cleaner's for you. -Others always pay for your foolishness. You mean that dress that no longer fits you? -At least I don't disgrace my family. -You're too busy disgracing others. Emma, you were going to look after Ernest! -Mum's babysitting. -You know I don't want her to. -She said it was okay. -You don't understand! I say! Julia. Julia! Yes, drop it. It's out of hand! -Is the phone working? -What? Your phone! Den Helder Naval Base Lieutenant Hendrickx. What? Telephone... It's your brother. -Hey kid... -Hi. I'm back... That's great... Where are you now? -In the harbour... -The harbour? -Things are getting out of hand... -Out of hand? The storm. Bert thinks we can't cope. Koos? Been drinking? That dike's lasted 100 years... I've never seen it like this. I'm going to mother... ...but I wanted to tell you. In case it really goes wrong... Julia. Julia... Wake up, wake up! Come on. Behind you! It's out of hand. The water... Ernest, it's all right! It's stopped... it's stopped. Where is father? He was close to the dike... Julia, watch out! Julia!! Give me your hand. We're engaged, aren't we? More or less? I still feel sick. -Five weeks later? -Yes. You haven't heard anything? Nowhere in Zeeland? No calls for help? From the North Sea... for the coastguard. Wait. The private phone is in the hall. Aldo, see you next week. Theo! -Are you flying back? -If I can take off. -Can you make a detour? -Why? -Come on. -What's up? -I'm worried about my brother. -Why? Zeeland has gone... -We have to go back. -Please go south. No one knows this... -We have to go back. -Believe me. We're near my mother's house. Please... Here... Here...! There! There is it. Our house is still there! That's her! My mother! -Go down... -What are you doing? Go down, closer! Hey... Hold on! -What are you doing? -We have to warn people. Shut the door. Maybe it's better to stay home, Julia. But it's Christmas! There's enough disgrace on this family. Wait! There! I can see someone! Close the door! Wait a second. -She won't make it. -Wait, I have to descend. No! Julia. Press hard... Come on. Good. You can do it. ...uncircumcised in heart and ears... ...ye do always resist... ...the Holy Ghost... -...as your fathers did. -It's a boy... I don't think they'll come, Julia. WOENSDRECHT AIRBASE Madam... You'd be better off in bed. Come on, I'll take you back. Doctor... ...she won't listen. -No... No... -Calm... Come on. Come. Unfortunately we need all the pilots we have. Report to Captain Mulder right now and if you fail to obey an order... ...I'll haul you in front of a court marshal myself. -Do I make myself clear, Lt Helmers? -Yes, sir. I can't decide your fate, Lt Hendrickx. Alas. I won't bother to say what I think of your insubordination. I talked to your superior, who mentions mitigating circumstances. ...a state of emergency declared. A car is waiting for you. Report to your base for further orders. Yes, sir. Wait! -I'm sorry it's necessary... -Wait. -Julia! -She's in shock... Can they let you free? Give me a few minutes. I know her. It's okay. Stop or you'll be sedated for a week. Ernest... my baby... There's little chance of reaching your house. You have something against me? -I didn't do anything to you? -You could have saved him. I didn't see it. I had no idea where you were going. -You could have thought. -I saw you drowning... ...and you'd die if I didn't get you to a doctor. Could you give me a hand? I can't move it. Grab it... One, two, yes... Keep it straight. Sorry, I have to get on. You can't. There's nothing left. Stop! Stop! Please! Julia. -Have you gone mad!? -I have to go back!! -You can't! There's nothing left! -I have to! Julia... Mind the step. Look! Are you okay? Come and sit down. Krelis, I knew you'd make it. -I nearly didn't. -Your wife and daughters? I don't know... I think this old man needs a tot? -I don't have any money. -I didn't ask that. I'd like one too. Two... -Two gins. The dry tables and chairs can be taken upstairs, okay? Let's get as much as possible upstairs. Sir... You can't neglect that. It needs to be cleaned. There's still some milk... ...but we have to save it for the children. And your husband isn't here? He... There was a car crash... ...three weeks ago. He died... I'm sorry. He's all I have left... Hey, neighbour. Did you pass my farm? Did you see...? There's only water, Krelis... You did your best. What was that? -Was that an apology? -Watch out! There! Hey, get out of my boat! I have to go to Oosterkerke. You're crazy. There's nothing left. -Are you deaf? -It's an emergency. It's all emergencies today. It's up to you. I won't bring you back. If we don't keep calm... Reverend... Ladies... Please everyone, if you don't... Please don't push. We have so little. One slice of bread... Sir, let the little boy go first. Are you charging restaurant prices, Guus? -My family has to eat. -I'll make sure you get paid. You shouldn't worry about profits though. -The hotel isn't charity... -We didn't do that in the war? I have a right to... Reverend, will you lead us in prayer? "The hair of my flesh stood up... "...and I feared your judgement." Come on. Keep rowing to the dike. Keep rowing. Have you seen my brother? -Koos Hendricks? -No. Come on. We have to go back. I thought he'd be safe... ...warm and dry... It's dry! It's dry! So it didn't tip over. He can't climb out, so... Maybe someone came and rescued him. -It's possible. -They must have. -Otherwise he'd still be here. -You don't know what happened to it. The lid was shut. The lid was shut. Come on. He must have been crying. Someone heard him. If you're right, your baby is safe. And we can leave here. Okay? I know... I know where he is. You won't drag it around. If it's not your child... ...you'll take it to a dry spot as soon as possible. Where there's food... and mothers. -Where do you want to go? -To the hotel. -We're going to the pumping station! -That's okay! It's close by there. We're taking them to the pumping station. They were hand-in-hand. Could you help? We're being flooded... Sorry! I didn't mean it like that. It's better to keep busy, don't you agree? No nappies. But maybe you can use something here. You have grandchildren? I hope his grandpa, my father, is safe. He lives in South Beveland. Don't you want to see your grandson? I don't have a grandson. There you are. Can you give me a hand? -I can't... -You can. -No Stien, I won't. -I'll help you. We have to take things to the attic. Yes, yes. Come on. -You have to get warm, Julia. -Indeed. Indeed. I realise you think God punished you more than others... ...but remember, he tests those dear to him... ...most severely. We can't give up hope. We'll always be here for you. In times like these, all Christians... We're one big family. We can only hope and pray that God will mercifully spare us. Has a little baby being brought here? Your mother... -And Emma? -No... I'm still looking for Ernest... ...your grandson... ...if you're interested. Has anyone seen my baby? Has a baby been brought in? Has anyone seen my baby? I already asked. You have to rest... it's already dark. There's nothing else you can do. -Is there some way she can sleep? -Stien? I suppose so. But I don't know where. -There isn't a spot in the hotel? -Maybe in the attic, up those stairs. -Ouch! -I'm sorry. Here, come and sit down. Go away. This spot is mine. Sorry. What great solidarity! Some people think I'm the devil's daughter. I expect I'll be blamed for this disaster. God's punishment... I look for some food and dry clothes... Your attention please. I have two lists here. Fill your name in on one. The other list is the missing. I'll hang them up here. There's no contact with the outside world. From now on food is rationed. That was it. Aren't you the brother of Koos Hendrickx? That's right. Aldo. Is Julia all right? I wanted to thank you... for helping her. I'm terribly sorry about your family. It's God's will. God's will... I'm sorry, women and children first. -Everyone's already eaten? -No. Not yet. Food is now rationed. You'll have to wait. -Okay. Just for Julia then. -You'll have to wait. You saw her. She has to eat! I'm sorry. Serve it! Communist! You don't want any? I already had some. Thank you. You said that already. For everything. I shouldn't have saved you, should I? That's true. You must be tired. If Ernest was found by someone without a boat... ...then he can't get here. Tomorrow we'll get a boat and find him. It's a reminder... ...that men can't be trusted. That's what I thought. It was always difficult for me too, with my father. He was always so certain and was good at everything. You'll see, if you persevere... ...it'll work out with your daughter.. God, in his mercy, will help you... God is going to have his hands full. You'll see. I'm convinced. That's sweet of you. We're going to sleep. Ernest? -Dammit... -You startled me. -Hey, what are you doing? -Get lost. Stop it, now. Stop it... Go away. Stop that. Quiet. Quiet. It's a misunderstanding. -Get lost. -She suffered. Tomorrow we'll... Tomorrow you're out of here! He's here. He's here. I'm not crazy. No. He's here, I'm sure. I heard him. I know. Quiet. Tomorrow we'll look when it's light. All right? Think first, before you interrogate everyone. MISSING: Ernest, 5 five weeks, dark hair. No. He's here! You can't check all babies. You'll be lynched by the mothers. What then? -Keep looking. -No. He's here! Everyone has their own worries. No one would take a crying baby and hide it from you. Little brother... -And mother? -Safe. That's why you came! What do you mean? Found what you were looking for? Julia... A baby was found... ...in a chest... I heard it on the way. Job found a baby in a chest. -How far away? -It's quite a way. About two hours if we're lucky. Why are you angry? Because I looked for my own brother? You were lying to me all along. And I believed you. I almost forgot: You helped Koos to flee! -That's what you think? -Isn't it true? Didn't you get him work as a sailor? I was in the merchant navy. Cape Town, Singapore, Sidney... I always thought about you wherever I was. And about... ...about our child. I was stupid. Yes. I thought maybe... ...that you and I... Can it wait? High tide is in an hour and we're only halfway. Where does Job live? By the locks. It's a cottage with a windmill. Thank you. It's hard enough without a girl getting hysterical. Everyone's complaining. She's your daughter. You have to intervene. -That girl brought disgrace on you. -That's enough. You don't understand me. I'm under great pressure here. Who from? People shouldn't interfere in everything. So you'll do something? I can't cope. I just renovated the hotel. I lost everything. She lost her mother, sister and child. And you complain about money? -I wasn't just talking about money. -Listen. I've had enough. If anyone complains, send them to me. Understood? -Yes... -Fine. Here. -Clean nappies. -Shall I wash Wiebeke? -I did it myself. -Okay. How old is he? Two months... Keep a close eye on him. Why? Weren't you here this morning? Krelis Verschoor's girl. She lost her baby. That must be terrible. -It was her own fault. -What do you mean? Didn't you know? -No, I lived in Assen... -Unmarried. And she acts as if it's normal... The whole village was up in arms. It's no surprise she paid the price... I don't know. I think God is merciful. I'm sorry, I have to go. I don't want you to come along. You don't even know his name. What's his name? He's my son, not yours. Go back and find a nice fisherwoman. Get yourself a life. What would you do? Koos, that's irrelevant. Are you going on? -We won't make it before high tide. -That's quite possible. And you carry on? Is that so? Well? What are you doing here? You can't imagine, can you? -What? -That you might be wrong. -Everyone deserves a second chance. -Are you talking about Koos or yourself? You had two. You lied to me. And you helped Koos to flee. I didn't lie! Koos never told me you were pregnant! Why didn't you say so? Because I know how Koos feels about you. But I didn't know what you felt for him. -I thought maybe you two... -You thought wrong. You have no idea what it's like to be alone and pregnant. -The whole village looks at you. -Julia! I'm not Koos. I don't need anyone. Julia, we won't make it. The water is rising too fast! Julia, stop! We have to go back to the dike. Maybe we can carry on that way. What's the point if your baby's alive but you're dead? You go ahead! Job! Job! Job? Job! There's a tin behind you. Julia, you have to bail out, otherwise we'll be swimming. Did you look at the list? There's a missing baby on it. Five weeks old. -It could be him. -I don't think so... My baby is older, Stien. At least two months... Your baby is dead... ...after that terrible accident. Felix is dead. Krina... Felix is dead. I know it's like a gift from God and I would... ...be very happy for you if you can keep the baby... ... but you do have to ask. I know. I know. You're a gift... I have to go back. -You're crazy. The dikes will burst. -The polder is already flooded. I know it's hard. But Gouda is waiting for me. I can't leave the dog. I was just planning... It's cold here. Don't you worry. She'll be back. I know she will. I would have gone with her... ...but she'd already left. There were two men with her, weren't they? Two boys... They must know what they're doing. Where's Julia? -She didn't want me to go... -Where is she? -Going to Job Bakker's house. -You left her there? Aldo is... Dammit. If she doesn't come back... Dammit! Listen. Job found Ernest and took him somewhere. Or gave him to someone. Yes. And you only give a baby to someone who can get away safely. Of course. That's logical. But we can't row around Zeeland forever. We have to get to the mainland to where refugees are taken. If Job gave the baby to someone, that will get recorded. We're going back to the hotel. He's there. You're so stubborn. Shall I row? God bless you and have a safe trip. -Hurry. The men's boats leave first. -The army's here! Men in the inflatables. Women have to wait for the sloops. Only men to the inflatables. Only one piece of baggage per person. Nothing heavy. Nothing heavy. Are you full? You can't take that. Your boats can arrive any minute. -No women and children in inflatables. -Why not? Three have sunk. There's barbed wire everywhere. -Check all the babies. -You can't. -They'll give you a straitjacket. -Straitjacket? I want to see all the babies. Everyone is known. No one can steal your baby. Go aboard. The boat's leaving. I'm staying. -The evacuation is not voluntary. -I'm staying too. That's impossible. I'm Lt Hendrickx. We have our own craft. I take responsibility. As you wish. We do have our own boat? Not anymore. Stien... May I have the list? I just want to look... The sloops. The sloops are here! All go outside. No heavy things, only babies. What can we do when everyone's gone? Ernest has either been evacuated or... ...or he's dead. I can't leave here. I won't know what happened. -Maybe he's been taken somewhere else. -Come on. Let's go. We lost everything... Can you hold her? It's a girl. It wasn't him. It was a girl. I was sure I heard him... It's not strange for you to hear him... in your head. I'm crazy... We can take you if you want. It's your decision. Low tide is in an hour or two. We could carry on searching. No. We're going. -She can't go with us! -She can't be trusted. -What? -Rubbish. I vouch for her. I don't agree. How dare she! I wouldn't have made it without you. -Krina... Krina... Did you ask? -He's not hers. She saw him, Stien. She came and tore him from my arms. Really, it was terrible. Ask anyone who... if you don't believe me... I think she's really confused. Today, during the opening of the Haringvliet Dam... ...it is apt to honour those who were so brave in times of great danger... ...and who's great courage and vigour, in the 1953 disaster... ...helped with their bravery to save many... ...from drowning, hypothermia, hunger and thirst. It's thanks to these people that many of you can be here today... -Thank you, on behalf of the Queen. -Thank you. -Thanks on behalf of the Queen. -Thank you too. -Thanks on behalf of the Queen. -Thank you. -I didn't think you were coming? -Surprise. Are you all right, Mum? I don't know if you remember me... I never apologised for that incident with your daughter. My mother doesn't have a daughter. You're mistaken. No, I'm sure. How old are you? Eighteen? May I speak to your mother alone? Tell me... I... I was very confused... My... ...my husband, my child... I'd just lost them... in a car crash. I didn't know it was your child. I didn't know any more. -I forgot. -Stop it! I forgot. I didn't know. What's your name? Felix. Felix. Can I talk to him? And she knew... all that time. You have to ask her. And... what now? I don't know. It was 18 years ago... ...and now you're a man. She's been your mother all your life. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I can do. What's my real name? Ernest. Ernest? That sounds serious. It was serious. And is he...? No. But you brought us together. I'll tell you some other time. I really have to... Sorry... this film is dedicated to all those affected by the great flood of 1953 in 1986, the delta works were completed
