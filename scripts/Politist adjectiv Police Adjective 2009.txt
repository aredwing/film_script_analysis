Thank you very much. - Hello. - Hello. - Nelu's not here? - I think he's at the meeting. - Didn't he leave a GPS for me? - No. - What are you doing? - It's mine. That's his closet, right? Wait ten minutes, he should be here. In fact, I wanted to talk to you. You still play foot-tennis, right? - Yeah. - Where? By the pool. Can I come too? I want to lose this belly... Why don't you jog if you want to lose weight? I get bored jogging. With tennis, you follow the ball, it's different. - So, how about it? - All the positions are filled. I can get a team together. Waste of time. Boys won't be interested. They play too well for you. How do you know how I play? I've seen you, you're not much good. What's that got to do with it? Well, if you're weak at football, you're weak at foot-tennis... - Where'd you get that idea? - Nowhere. That's how it is, it's a law. - Is it written down somewhere? - No, but it's still a law. Just say you don't want me to come! - I think I just did. - Don't go on about laws then. I'm not going on about any law. You are no good, you'd only disrupt us. - "Disrupt you"? - Yeah. If you're not good, you'll disrupt us, right? Serious game this foot-tennis. You'd think you were talking about chess. Listen, tell Nelu I was looking for him to get that GPS back. - I'll tell him. - Good. Bye. - Hello! - Hi! The Boss was asking about you again. Did you tell him I was busy? He said to go to him when you're finished. - Did you say I was busy? - I told him. - What? - That you were busy. - Is that all? - I said you were tailing the kid... - And what did he say? - Like I said, go to him when you'd finished. - Is that all? - That's all. - See you. - Bye. - Good morning! - Hello! Come in. - Good morning. - Hello Cristi. Take a seat. Is it ready? Not really. What's this? The case with the kid? I've been following him a week. Nothing! - Meaning... - I've also brought you the pursuit reports. He's very withdrawn: school, home, a girl visits him sometimes, and that's it. - And his brother? - I called Bucharest, - he's in no database. - Circle of friends? Alex, the squealer, and a girl, I don't know her name. They don't seem to have friends. He doesn't. - He smokes? - Yes. - What? - Hashish. - Does he sell? - No. And the squealer doesn't even say he sells... Where and when does he smoke? Breaktimes, in a park by the old army base... - And then they go to school? - Only Alex. Who's Alex? - Alex is the squealer. - I see... - And the other two? - They hang around, or go to a bar. Once they went to his place... It's all in the file. The parents? - Whose? - His, the dealer's. Victor... I wouldn't call him a dealer, because he isn't selling. As far as you know. What do his parents do? They both work at a dairy, he's a manager, she's an accountant. The kind of couple who leaves hand-in-hand comes home together. - Neighbours? - Nothing special. I spoke to two. One is a friend of mine in their building. Hardly knows him. He knows the brother better, the guy fixed his computer twice. They're computer freaks. And what does Anghelache say? I've avoided him. He'll ask me to make a sting operation and sort it out when we take the statements. - What do you propose instead? - I'd begin following the squealer. Why? I don't understand why he squeals on the other guy. For the girl. If he's the source of the drugs? Then I've nothing, no evidence except what this kid is telling me. Cristi, you still have to make the sting operation, don't you? I think we're rushing. If his brother is the source, there are two options... - The first? - He won't tell us about the brother and we'll get him only for consuming. - He'll say... - I wouldn't squeal on my brother. Sure... The second option? He squeals, he'll never forgive himself, and I don't want that on my conscience. Did you put the joint in his mouth? - That's the law, and that's it. - A pretty bad law then. Cristi, you're not qualified to comment on the law. Ok... I went on honeymoon to the Czech Rep... - You got married? - Yes. Congratulations. Good for you, Cristi. Why not Paris? Paris, the "City of Love"! My wife wanted it. If it was up to me, we'd have gone to Turkey, to the coast. Prague's beautiful too. It's called the "Golden City". The "Golden City"? There're many buildings with gold on them. I saw a theatre with an entire ceiling of gold. Did you know that The Black Church in Brasov once had a golden roof? Yes. It burned down. That's what the government should be doing. Renovate the roof of the Black Church. Then we could call Brasov "The City of Gold". You know, it used to be called Stalin City. "City of Gold" sounds great too. It would attract loads of tourists. Prague's a much bigger city. Well, then we could call it The Little Prague. It would still be better. Well, anyway... We'd have Bucharest as "Little Paris" and Brasov, "Little Prague". - Sounds great, doesn't it? - Yes. Prague is also called "Little Paris". - Really?! - Yes... well. You know what? Those Czechs are smart. They just say it to sound more important. Isn't it the same thing with Bucharest? Let's see. Tell me more about this file... That's why I brought up The Czech Republic. They smoke in the street and it's no big deal. I'm sure that soon, the law will change here too. Cristi, there won't be any change in the law. Nowhere in Europe are you arrested for smoking ajoint. Cristi, listen to this old guy. Maybe attitudes will change a bit, but the law won't. Anything else? I don't wanna put him in jail then meet him 7 years later... He's out in 3 and a half. Or less. His father's an accountant, he's well off... I don't want to ruin somebody's life for a law that will change soon. Cristi, don't be obstinate. Enough nonsense about this law. You're getting hung up on the law... What do you propose about the file? To begin following the squealer. I think he's the key. I propose you wind up the case as soon as possible, because it's a small matter to spend so much time on. - OK. - Right? - I have another request. - Go on. Two in fact. First, to object if the Boss wants me to make the sting operation... No. The second... - Don't tell him we've spoken. - Fine. - Anything else? - I'll call you when I have - something more solid. - Fine. - Take the file. - Aren't you going to read it? I'll read it when you're finished. - Thank you. - Right. Bye. Hello, Sica. I need you to run a check on a car for me. A for Anca, I for Ion, not Judas, C for Cristi. This evening. I'll come around later. Thanks. Sasha, Sasha! Sasha, come here! Sasha, come here! Yes. Yes. Of course I remember. I spoke to them. It's fixed. I've to go pick it up. But I can't get home unless I get out of the office. Thanks. Love you too. Bye. - Yes? - Did you find it? Yes. Look. Belongs to a company. AIAN CONSTRUCT SA. Sounds familiar... It's a construction firm that built the block in Crucea Garii... Yeah... It's pretty big... belongs to Aurel lancu. - That's why it's called AIAN? - I suppose. Look, I got you the other cars. - Thanks. All the best. - Yes. "Pursuit report no. 7 Today I began the pursuit of the aforementioned Victor Pascu at 7:40, when he left his residence at 23 Toamnei St and went towards Bacovia High School, along the route described in the previous reports. On the way, the suspect met nobody did not use his mobile phone and smoked a single cigarette, which I checked but which was not of relevance to this case. I resumed tailing at 10:50 in the yard of nursery 14. Victor Pascu, Alex lancu and the girl previously described smoked a cigarette, remains of which were positive when tested for THC. However: the source of the drugs; appears insincere, stating that the drugs are used only by him and Victor Pascu; background and his deeds do not appear to suggest he represents a danger to society; At 2:00 I went back on Alex lancu at Bacovia High. He went via Bacovia, Muresan, Feroviari, Piata Veche, Filature and Ion Barbu streets. He entered the yard of house n 12. In front of the house there was a Seat Ibiza, registration 06 AIC. I checked it, it belonged to the company SC. AIAN Constructii SRL, owned by Aurel lancu. At 3:05 appeared the girl with whom lancu and Pascu have used hashish. After calling on the intercom, she entered the yard. She had changed her clothes since 10:50. The young woman left Alex lancu's residence at 4:25. I followed her through Ion Barbu, Filature, loanisei, Feroviari and Pacii streets, and she entered in building n 32. I ascertained that she entered apartment 12 of entrance B on which was written "Paraschiv family". I ended the pursuit at 4:55." Hello, Alex... Cristi here. Could we meet this evening? Where do you want to meet? At the Magnolia. That's OK? See you in half an hour! Fine. An hour then. Bye. - Good evening. - Sit down. Dan! - Bring me a large vodka. - I'll have a Cola. Have one. I don't like drinking alone. - I don't drink alcohol. - At all? I'm afraid my Dad will smell it when I go home. - Not even a beer? - No. Thank you. - So a large vodka and? - A cola... One cola. - No thank you. - Also because of your Dad? Yes... You're not afraid he'll smell the hash? He doesn't know what hash smells like. You didn't call about Victor's brother... No Sir, because Victor doesn't know when he's coming home. Don't call me Sir, I'm not old... - It feels more natural... - Try. I didn't call 'cause he doesn't know when he's coming. I asked him about 3 times then let it go. So he wouldn't get suspicious. I need you to bring me some hashish. I need a sample for the file. - How much? - A few grammes, tell him you want to smoke it alone. - He might not give it to me. - Why? He's very stingy... - Stingy? - Yes, it's just for him. If he was stingy he wouldn't give you anything or he'd make you pay. Maybe that's what he wants. To get me hooked so then I'll pay him. - Is that what you think? - He's capable of doing anything. But aren't you friends? In a way we are, in fact we were, but we're not so close anymore. - Why? - Lots of complications... For example? - It's no use, Sir. - Don't sir me. - It's no use going into it. - Why not? I've got history homework for tomorrow and I have to study more... - If I could go now... - You haven't finished your cola. - Don't you two have girlfriends? - No. - Neither you, nor Victor? - Neither of us. So, don't forget about Victor's brother, and get me a sample for the file. - I'll try. - I can't go on without it. I'll try. - I'll get it. - Thanks. - I really have to go. - Am I stopping you? Thank you. Goodbye. Call me when you find out, or send an SMS. - Yes, I'll call you. Goodbye. - Bye. Good evening. Hello. Your dinner's on the cooker. - Have you eaten? - Yes. Turn it down a bit. Turn it down a bit. Among white blossoming branches The day is soon forgotten The whispering of night surrounds me With the perfume of spring You say I am dear to you You will love me a lifetime And don't believe in separation You believe in longing and happiness I won't leave you, love For a moment of illusion I won't leave your side If you will be with me What would the sea be without the sun? What would the field be without the flower? What would today be without tomorrow? What would life be without you? Life goes forward Who believes? Who lies? Speak up, he who has betrayed My insane love Life goes forward Love may bring Happiness and pain And love and silence I won't leave you, love For a moment of illusion I won't leave your side If you will be with me What would the sea be without the sun? What would the field be without the flower? What would today be without tomorrow? What would life be without you? This food is really good. Anca, this song doesn't make any sense. Why? "What would the field be without the flower?" "What would the sea be without the sun?" What else would it be? It would still be the field and the sea. I haven't paid that much attention to the lyrics. Why do you like it then? They're like images. Meaning, love wouldn't be as beautiful otherwise. As what? Like the sea without the sun? Yes. "Life goes on". Can it go backwards? Can we talk when it's over, please? Do you picture any image? No. "I won't leave you, love". - Love is without an article. - What? She's saying, "I won't leave you love", love being without article. She's meaning love as an absolute. So? So it's an anaphora. What anaphura? ANA-PHO-RA, not ANA-PHU-RA. It's a rhetorical device. Didn't you hear "what would be?" "What would the sea be with no sun? What would the field be with no flowers? Today without tomorrow? Life without you?" It tries to define this ideal love by associating it with symbols. The sea is infinite, the sun is light, the field is birth, creation, and the flower is beauty. Hold on... Are they images or symbols? They're not images, they're symbols. No... In fact, they're connected. They're images which become symbols. For example, "the sea". As an image it's infinite and then it becomes a symbol of infinity. "The flower" is beautiful and becomes a symbol of beauty. I don't understand. If they wanted to say infinity why didn't they just say it directly? Why do they say the sea with the sun or without the sun? - Have you been drinking? - A vodka. - And then what? - Two beers, this is the third. - I think it's the fourth. - No, it's... the second, the third. Even without drinking I still wouldn't understand it. - Come on to bed. - And the thing with flowers. Some flowers are beautiful, but some are ugly. Come to bed. Forget the flowers. Sorry, I didn't wash the dishes. - I'll wash them tomorrow. - Thanks. Here's a towel. Anca? It's like " What would toothpaste be without a toothbrush?" - Hi. - Hello. - What's up? - I'm waiting for the meeting. You? Nothing up either. I said I was waiting, not there was nothing up. Are you coming? To the meeting? No. He'll get annoyed again and take it out on me. When are you going? In 10 minutes. - Not earlier? - No. - Come on, go earlier. - Why? I'll go to Passports and Criminal Records and I'd rather not bump into him. Wait 10 minutes, let me finish my coffee. Anyhow, I can't go in early. You know how punctual he is. Come on. Listen: "Hot drinks make colds worse. Doctors point out that the habit of drinking hot infusions for colds and flu is very harmful. " - I thought it's the other way round. - Come on, Nelu, finish your coffee. I'm drinking up, but we can't go in anyway. You want me to sit with Gina in the secretary's office? "Both very hot and very cold drinks dry up the mucus membranes. Furthermore, hot drinks can burn the mucus membranes, causing micro-lesions which encourage the appearance of bacteria. The role of the mucus membranes is to limit the spread of bacteria. " - Should I tell the Boss anything? - No. Say you haven't seen me today, if he asks. - Hello Belu. - Hello Nelu. Did you take the key? Yes. Bye. - Hello Cristi. - Hello. - Could you get some names for me? - Of course. These two are father and son, for this one I've only surname and address. Want some chocolate? No thanks. - When do you need this? - As soon as possible. I'm going now to Public Records to get the names of the other family members. Why don't I do them all at once? Do these first. I'm in a hurry. If one of them has a record I might have time to investigate further. When will you bring the others? Today. I hope Vali moves on it fast. I leave at 15:30 today. - I'll have them by lunchtime. - Is at 1 alright? I don't know, I haven't talked to Vali yet. At 12 I'm meeting a friend for coffee. Call me ten minutes before. - OK, thanks. - See you. Bye. Sorry. Look straight ahead. Chin up a bit. Hello Costi. - Hi. - Please check... Once more your eyes were closed. Leave it on the desk. Attention... Good! Perfect. After 4 with your ID. Come on Florin next one. The first two are father and son, for the third one check the whole family. - I'll try. - Can you do it today? - The coat... - I'm bringing more at noon. I'll do them all together then. - It'd help me if you do these first. - It won't help me. You've seen the queue. - Please do these first. - I'll try. Bye. - Thanks. - Look at me. Right! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, Vali. - Hello. Did you get all the names in the family? For this one I've only the surname and address. - When do you need it? - By lunchtime. At 1.30? I have to go through Passports and Criminal Records too. At 1? - OK, 12.30. - And something else. - What? - Get copies to Costi and Dana. I'll be out and don't want to return just for this. Costi... and Dana... And what do I do with yours? I'll pick it up before you leave. If I don't make it, put it under my door. Or will I leave it with Nelu? If Nelu's there, leave it on my desk, if he's not, stick it under the door. Three then. For you, Costi and Dana. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Good luck. Thanks, bye. Yes... Good day, Captain. I'm on a case. What time do you leave? I can't get there by 2. I can't, I have a new lead to follow and I want to check it out today. I'll definitely be in tomorrow morning. Dana, hello. I'm here, where are you? Did you find anything? What? Please, no more than ten minutes... I'll wait for you in the corridor. - Hi. - Hi Cristi, how are you? - Fine. - How are things? Look what I found on Paraschiv. I've made you a copy. No victims... No victims. He's smashed a barrier at a railway crossing. - He crashed into it? - Into the train? - Yes. - No, he was stopped... by the barrier. There's a diagram of the accident towards the case but I didn't copy it, since it wouldn't help you anyway. - Help me with what? - With your case. - Hard to tell. - I'm not going back down to the archive. - Is that from Vali's list? - Yes. - The rest are okay? - Yes. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Bye. Hello. Hello Costi. Did you get those details for me? I haven't had time. I told you it was urgent. Do you think I work for you? That's not the point. That is the point. You come here with deadlines, orders even send Vali round... - Give me a break. - You're exaggerating. I'm not exaggerating at all. How often have I given you a deadline? Florin... If you keep me talking, I won't to do anything for you today. So are you going to do it for me or not? - I will, when I finish my own work. - Meaning? Meaning 3.30. Florin, will you do it for me? If you start that, I won't do it at all. I'm seeing the Boss tomorrow and if I don't get results I'll put someone in jail for nothing. I'll b at 3.30. I'm ready at 4. At 4. If I can't get back here by 4, will you leave it under my door? If anything turns up I'll leave it for you. One of them has a record, so pay attention to him. Don't I pay attention to them all? No, that's not what I said. I need his entries and exits, all you have on him. That's what I meant. Make a mark beside his name. Here. No, it's on Vali's list. Vali... Here. That's it. Thanks. You're welcome. - Bye. - And please don't phone again. I said 4, and at 4 it'll be ready. - Hello. - Hello. - Have you got tea? - Yes. - I'll have one. - What kind? Fruits? Lemon? Mint? Fruits. With sugar, please. Two spoons. I saw you yesterday too. Is something special going on? No. I'm keeping an eye on that hole outside. Why? Watching some uninstalled parts so no-one steals them... Will it take much longer? - There's the money. - Okay. - Another two or three days. - Thanks a lot. "Pursuit report nr. 8 I began the pursuit of Alex lancu at 7.15 at his residence at 12 Ion Barbu St. At 7:40 the entire family father, mother and son left home. The father got into a Land Rover 4X, registration 05 AIC while 2 other got in a Seat Ibiza, registration 06 AIC and set off. I ended the pursuit, as I hadn't anticipated this and had not come by car. At 10:50 I resumed the pursuit in the yard of kindergarten 14, where the three youths turned up and smoked, just as in previous days. The remains of the cigarette tested positive for THC. I resumed the pursuit of Alex lancu at his residence from 14.45. Nothing happened for 3 hours. I ended the pursuit at 16.55 when Aurel lancu, Alex's father, arrived. Following inquiries made at Criminal Records, Public Records and Passports, I discovered that lulian, the girl's brother, was convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol, and has made many journeys out of the country. The frequency of these, every two months, to Italy, surprised me. I believe lulian Paraschiv is possibly the source of the drugs. My checks show that he is at present in Romania. I propose to be investigated. " Something between us isn't working. Why? We used to eat together more often. I can't remember the last time we ate lunch together. I can't get home at lunch. I'm after some school kids, I must be there... - when they finish school... - I know. How do you know? Yesterday you left your file on the coat rack. I forgot to tell you because you started on about the song. You made a mistake. What mistake? "Nici un" "not any" is only one word. - Since when? - Two years ago. Why? It's considered a negative pronominal adjective. Before there were two words was considered a conjunction and "un" an indefinite ar ticle. You've lost me now... Now it's written as one word, trust me... I'll write it that way, so. From what I see from the file, you aren't going to arrest them. They're crazy. - Are my pupils taking drugs? - You know I don't like to talk about work. Fine. You should change that pullover. - What's wrong with it? - You've been wearing it for 4 days. I'll change it. Who was singing that song last night? Angela Similea? Mirabela Dauer. - Are you obsessed with it? - That's what I've been thinking all day. I won't listen to it any more. You can listen to it, but with headphones. I'm not going to. I've heard it ten times. Who decides stuff like that about words? The Romanian Academy. And is the feminine form - the same as the masculine form? - Yes. If I write or say "o tigara" "a cigarette"? A is an indefinite article. - I gave you a cigarette. - Yes. "Nicio" "any" cigarettes is that adjective you've mentioned. A negative pronominal adjective. You mean there are people who analyze that kind of thing? The Romanian Academy. They're crazy... Want some more? It's very good. Go on, help yourself. I won't leave "any" "nicio". Is that written as one word? Will you lock it? I left my keys in my jacket. - Go back and get them. - It's bad luck to go back. - Your luck is bad anyway. - Thanks a lot... Morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Has the Boss arrived? - Take a seat. Captain, the boys are here... Yes. - Do you have the file with you? - Yes. He has... Very good. - Give me the file, please. - Why? The Boss wants to read it, then you go and discuss it. - What about me? - What about you? - Will I go in? - No, you're to wait here too. He is angry because you didn't come in the last few days. Yes. Now he'll give me a hard time too because of you. Gina, you work even harder than us. I'm not in the mood for your sarcasm. I wasn't being sarcastic, I meant it. How many pages is that file of yours? The boss is slow at reading. - Maybe he can hear you. - No he can't. - Do you want a paper? - What do you have? Several. "The Thought", "The Times", "The Daily". Here. - Sure you don't want one? - No. I've read "The Thought", I've read "The Times", I've read "The Journal". Let's see what "The Truth" has to say... Yes. Right. Go on in. - Good day, Captain, Sir. - Good day, Captain, Sir. Sit down. How long have you been working on this? How much longer were you gonna spend on it? I'd wait for Victor's brother and check out the girl's brother in the meantime... Did a sting operation not occur to you? - It did, but it's risky. - Risky? - What if he's not the source? - Who's "he"? - Victor's brother. - Who do they come from, then? - No clue. I'm trying to find it out. - It's 8 days. Where do you think they're from? They could be from anywhere. From the girl or even the girl's brother. - The one with the accident record? - Yes. You're being ridiculous. Sir, something's not right here. Why Alex din squealed? "Denounced". Criminals say "squealed". Denounced... Why did Alex denounce Victor if they're friends, - or why didn't he say the girl smoked too? - What's so complicated? Make a sting operation and get the truth from their statements. - It's still risky. - Stop with the risks... It's a risk, it's risky... What's risky about such a simple case? There's a chance Victor won't squeal on his brother. And where's the risk? As you'd put it. You have him for supplying. - All this case only to get Victor? - So what? And the kid will do 7 years in jail for ajoint? - So we're destroying his life for nothing. - Did you make him smoke? No, but I don't think it's normal. And you think it's normal that he gives it to the others? Sir, they're just crazy kids. This crazy kid supplied who will give it to other crazy kids. And we just sit by? - They're not that crazy. - You used the word. Are you sick? Don't you know the meaning of the words you use? I reckon he'll denounce his brother. - What's it to you? - I was just saying... You can comment on your own case. Okay, that's it. Tomorrow, you'll make the sting operation. - I won't do it. - Excuse me? I think there's no point in risking... in rushing. We wait for Victor's brother, he'll be here in 2 weeks, and we'll pick him up then. - Have you forgotten the law? - Of course not. Does the word "supplying" mean anything to you? I still think it's better if we charge the brother for supplying. Listen Cristi, have you ever harvested grapes? Yes. And where do you cut them? Sorry? Bring me that plastic fruit from the desk. Take a grape. Where's it cut? - From the stem. - As a bunch, right? - As a bunch. - See? You're telling me you'd cut the bunch halfway down. I think I see you mean. It doesn't apply here. It applies perfectly. Listen to me. I have more experience with people. I think it's enough if we get his brother... Make the sting operation. You'll see I was right. I won't do it. I don't want to have that kid on my conscience. If he keeps converting others will your conscience be easy? I don't know yet. I think we're talking different languages. Tell me what "conscience" means for you. - Not to be sorry... - Define the word "conscience". That's what I'm trying to say. It's something that would make me feel bad. Is that all? In fact, it's something that stops me from doing something bad. So you don't know what it is. I do know, but you're putting me on the spot and... Alright, I'll let you off the spot. Have a good think about it and tell me what "conscience" is for you. - Nelu, write it down. - Sorry? Write what Cristi says on the board. Ready? Conscience is something... within me... that stops me from doing something bad. What do you mean, "bad"? That I'd afterwards regret. Something bad... That I'd afterwards regret. - Have you written it down? - Yes, Boss. Because of this thing, you can't make the sting operation, right? Yes. Gina, bring me a dictionary. A Romanian dictionary. Find one. In 5 minutes, I want a dictionary on my desk! - And you, Nelu? - Same as yesterday. - Meaning? - I haven't found the girl. - Have you looked for her? Where? - Yes. - At her home. - When? After the meeting, lunchtime, in the evening... - And? - I couldn't find her. - Was anybody in? - Nobody. - She's making a fool of you. - My informant says he hasn't seen her for a week. - Perhaps she's back working the streets. - That's what criminals call it... - To prostitute herself. - Did you run it through passports? Yesterday, but I haven't got anything back. - When did you make the inquiry? - Yesterday. - Yesterday it was the day before yesterday. - Yesterday I told you it was yesterday. Yesterday you said you did it yesterday, which means the day before yesterday. - I think you misunderstood. - I think you did. She'll change her statement. Now that she's made up with her pimp. - Charge her for perjury... - And lose the pimp, the procurer... She'll denounce him. Talk to the Prosecutor and get on it. - Alright. Can I go? - No. Sit down. I was thinking of talking to the prosecutor... You've got a sudden urge to work? - I was looking through the file... - Damn it, Nelu. I wasn't born yesterday. I was born the day before yesterday. You've made a spelling mistake. - Yes, I know. - Then why did you make it? My wife told me yesterday, but I forgot to correct it. Have you thought it over? I won't do it. Yes you will... Lads, you know what we're doing here? - Having a meeting? - No. Dialectics, that's what it's called. Do you know what that means? Finding out the truth. That's what you said. - Winter's coming... - I wish it would. - Found one. - Where? - Dana, in Records. - Give it to Cristi. And buy one, so we have one in the office too. Will I take it from petty cash? Do you know what conscience is? - Sorry? - The word "conscience", have you heard of it? - Of course. - What does it mean? It's when you believe in God... Well Gina, you'll put it of petty cash, because you'll need it too. - So I'll put it on petty cash. - Exactly. - Right. Do you need me for anything else? - No. Look up "conscience". "Constiinta" "conscience/consciousness". A feeling, intuition that a man has of his existence. Slower. Slow down so you understand it. An intuitive or automatic knowledge an individual has of his own existence and of things around him. Faculty of noticing and understanding. Social consciousness -a totality of ideas, conceptions, knowledge, mentalities of a human group, reflecting its conditions of existence, as well as the social psychology of people. Class consciousness... - Should I keep reading? - Yes. Part of the social consciousness reflecting the social existence of a particular class, (as opposed to existence, matter) thought and spirit. A sense of moral responsibility concerning one's own behaviour. A matter of conscience the problem of resolving a difficult moral problem. Qualms of conscience - remorse, regret. To have a clean conscience: To be sure of not having transgressed moral law or the laws of the state. To have no conscience - to have no scruples. In good conscience - in good faith. Freedom of conscience, the right of the citizens to hold any religious or philosophical view etc... From French conscience, Latin conscientia. So... Nelu, read Cristi's definition. Conscience is something within me that stops me from doing something bad... that I'd afterwards regret. So you have a feeling, an intuition that you'll regret arresting this kid, right? - Yes. - Fine. So far so good. Now read just the passage about qualms of conscience. Qualms of conscience - remorse, regret. To have a clean conscience: to be sure of not having transgressed moral law or the laws of the state. Against moral law or the laws of the state. Yes? - Yes. - Fine... So now I have to ask you, if you don't arrest Victor, won't you have qualms of conscience for defying the law? - No. - Why? The law will change. In a few years we won't make arrests for use or supply. - You're foolish. - It's like that abroad. - Nobody's arrested for supplying. - Really foolish. - Do you change the law at will? - No. Why not? You no longer believe in the law you, as police, have to obey. - hat's not true. I believe in the law. - You believe in your own moral law. Let's define moral law. Search law. Law - a philosophical category that expresses the essential, necessary, relatively stable or constant relationship within and between the objects and phenomena of reality or between the successive states of a certain process. A regular model of change in a phenomenon or process, expressing its essential character. A binding regulation, established and defended by the state... That's the law that we have to defend. Go on. Unwritten law -tradition, custom of the land. Man of the law, agent of the authority of the state. A person who respects the law scrupulously. That's what we have to be. Go on. Legal person - lawyer. Law of the jungle -loose, aggressive competition. According to the law -just, legal. Law abiding respectful of the law. His word is law his authority is obeyed precisely... Law and order - respect and obedience for the law. It's (not) a law it's (not) necessarily so. In the name of the law - standard formula used to invoke legal authority. In accordance with the law, compliant with legislation. A legal process, judgement, legal, constitutional. Religion, belief. A law unto oneself to disregard the laws of state and society, to do as one wishes. Latin lex, legis. - That's all? - Yes. - Anything about moral law? - No. Look up "moral". "Morala" "morality" - All the rules of social behaviour, behaviour of individuals towards each other and towards society, the breaking of which is punished by public opinion rather than by law; ethics - correct behaviour; mores. Systematization of moral rules; Ethics. Book that comprises these norms: treaty of ethics. Conclusion contained in a text, especially in a fable. From Latin moralis, French morale. - That's the end? - Yes. - So, again, nothing about moral law. - No. In the end, this moral law is something vague that depends on each person. If you're religious like Gina, it could be the Bible. Though even the Bible is now open to interpretation, so nobody can rely on it. If you're an atheist you have your rules, same thing. So where does this lead us? To chaos. Right? - Yes... - Right. And in order for there not to be chaos, there is the law that we as police officers have to obey and enforce. Right? - I think we're taking it too far. - We're not. On the contrary, we're getting closer. You don't even know your duty as a police officer. - Yes I do. - I'm telling you that you don't. Because between this moral law and the Law, the Constitution, you choose this moral law of yours. So, in this moment you have to decide if you're going to enforce the law and be a police officer or you'll follow this moral law of yours, and you leave the police. Do you understand now? In fact, you no longer know what you are, that's the problem. I'll help you one more time. Look up "police". Police -police officer, member of the police force, adjective, police (detective) novel or film involving criminal happenings that are to some degree mysterious, resolved in the end through the ingenuity of a police officer or detective. About police states or regimes which are supported by the police and which exercise control through repressive methods... Ridiculous! All states depend on the police... From German, polizist. It's from Greek, polis - city... Those who run the city. Boss? I'll make the sting operation, then Cristi will have a clean conscience and we'll close the case. You really haven't understood a thing. So, you have time to think until 4. The prosecutor will also be here. Nelu, you come at 4 too. Right. That's all. Sir! This stays with me! Cristi, watch the net. You've touch the net. No, no. - The wind blew it. - I didn't see it. - I was watching the ball. - Forget it... Here's kindergarten 14. This is where the kids smoke. Behind the kindergarten is Bacovia St, to the right the bakery. We have a fence, access is blocked off. Facing the nursery is a high chain-link fence, and an access right in front of the kindergarten. An alley goes from here into the kindergarten yard and it intersects with another alley which opens into Berzelor St. This building belongs to school no. 2, this is another building, this is another. Access is blocked here, access is blocked here. There's also an opening here that leads to Stefan cel Mare St. The main entrance to the kindergarten is here and there's also a service door on this side. This is what I propose: that I wait inside with Nelu, here there'll be a team with witnesses. Witnesses can be taken from the building site nearby. A team can wait here at the access to Stefan cel Mare St, yourself and the Prosecutor can be in the alley that leads to Berzelor. The camera can be in this building, somewhere on the first floor. The visibility is very good for taking pictures. They're double-glazed, they won't see it. The cameraman will give the signal, and I'll confirm it. Then the teams go in, from here, here and here, while myself and Nelu come out from here. They've nowhere to go... OK. Nelu, tell the team on Bacovia to get two witnesses. Understood. They're only kids, so go easy on them. Just communicate with each other and watch out for signals.
