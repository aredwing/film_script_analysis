We are now standing in front of what I'm almost certain to be the tomb of the lost brother of King Siptah who once ruled over the upper and lower Egyptian valley more than 2,000 years ago. Everyone, including my peers, believed his existence to be nothing more than a myth. Well, we are now about to prove them wrong. For what you are seeing behind me now is the entrance to the tomb of what the ancient Hebrews called the Cursed King. Just the mere mention of his name was so utterly terrifying to the ancient Egyptians that even the symbol for his name, the cat, could not so much as be written or pronounced by anyone. Now won't you please follow me, uh, Steven? You see, Neferu, the son of Harcoptis was in succession to be the king when his younger brother Siptah had him captured and mummified while still alive. And right down these tunnels is where he was buried. And this is where we believe we will find him, the king who cannot be named. What was that, Steven? What was that? Jesus, what is that? No. No! Jesus Christ! I am a collector. Treasures is what I seek. I have possessed the most precious riches the world has ever known. The rarest, the most magnificent. But one has eluded me for all these years. A precious jewel, shrouded in mystery, wrought with danger. It belonged to a cursed king, Neferu, a pharaoh, who some say still haunts his final resting place, seeking new victims. A pharaoh who was buried alongside a most precious stone. A jewel of immense worth and incredible power. They call it, the Kodek stone. Only one man can get it for me. And his name is, Jack Wells. Hey, sexy. Like the presents? Carl? What have you gone and joined the NSA? - You do live an exciting life for an archeology professor. I do what I can, Carl. We're gonna be in the hot tub. I suppose I have to thank you for this package. Don't mention it. It suits you. My birthday is still a few months away, so I suspect an ulterior motive for this little surprise of yours. Look closer. That's right, the camera's in the glasses. So you can see all this? I'm watching everything that you are. You're new glasses are transmitting via a satellite uplink to the comfort of my home. You're eyes belong to me, Jack. I'll be a son of a bitch. And how the hell did you get your hands on these? I called in a favor from a friend. You must have some important friends, this is not your standard over-the-counter technology. I have my sources, like you have yours. There's something else in the box. What's this? Something to make life easier. I hope it's sanitary. Stop fucking around, Jack, time is of essence. You hear me? Yeah, like you're living in my head. Should keep us in contact at all times. Okay, Santa, I got the gifts. Now what do you want from me? I believe you know, Jeremy Cooper. Yep, he is the biggest asshole in the world of archeology. Indeed, but the asshole is putting together a team and I want you on it. What makes you think, he'd want me to tag along? He's not my biggest fan. You're still the best Egyptologist he knows and you can decipher hieroglyphics like you were born speaking that gibberish. Where he's going, he's gonna need someone like you. Strike that, he's gonna need you. Hmm. Where's he going? His team is flying to Hijaza in three days. Hijaza? What the hell are they doing there? Neferu. Neferu, the cursed king? Come on. Carl, that's a myth. Not anymore, according to Professor Behar. He's very much real. Behar? Hey, didn't he drop out of sight two months ago while he was in Egypt? He did, but some Bedouins found his camera out in the middle of nowhere. Egyptian officials got a hold of it. The footage showed a tomb he uncovered in the desert near Hijaza. Cooper wants to find it. Now, Carl why do you care so much about a tomb? I never figured you to be interested in anything other than money. That I am. You ever hear of the Kodek stone? Yeah, the diamond. Yes, the diamond. Story goes that it was buried with the cursed king, a very precious gift from his brother Siptah, to keep, Neferu's soul from coming back. Cursed kings had a bad habit of rising from the dead back then and doing all sorts of bad stuff to the living. So, you're after the Kodek stone. What, you're too lazy to do your own dirty work? I rather you get out there and break your neck, it's much easier. Very altruistic Carl, as always. You get me the stone and you and me will call it even. Wipe the slate clean. What if I tell you to go fuck yourself? Well... Then the Egyptian authorities will receive a file proving that the Howard Carter artifacts aren't as genuine as they think. And the details of your involvement in their replacement. Guess I better go grab my toothbrush, Carl. I'm not that surprised the Behar was searching the cursed earth. He always insisted that Neferu's tomb had to be out here somewhere. It would have been a great insult to his brother. And it would have prevented his soul from crossing over to the afterlife. What do you think, Dr. Wells, are we looking in the right place? Dr. Wells? What was the question? We were wondering, if you think we're looking in the right place. The Bedouins claim they found Behar's camera out there chances are he was with it. Well, they could have stolen it stumbled across Behar and his assistant, killed them and raided their equipment. Keep your mind on the job, Jack, you're not there to add another notch to your bedpost. They only had the camera with them. Behar would have had thousands of dollars of equipment with him. Isn't that right, Dr. Cooper? He had access to the latest equipment, geo-physical, thermo and access to full GPS systems. No self-respecting university would have signed off on the search. Yet, we've all seen the footage and we're all here following in his footsteps. Someone at Brown's might have signed the check. I may not agree with many, if any, of Behar's theories, but he had clearly found a tomb. We owe it to him to prove that he was right or not. Talking like he's already dead. Well, there's been no contact with him for over three months. If he's not dead, he's as good as. And nobody's concerned why? Well, that's why you brought me along. What do you do, Kate? I work for a private security firm. Oh, let me stop you before you make a fool of yourself by making some crass chauvinistic remark, Dr. Wells. I know I'm a woman. And why are you here, Dr. Wells? What use do we have of your talents? Dr. Wells is an Egyptologist. One of the best. He specializes in regional dialects. Oh, I've heard differently. If you're talking about the little scrape I had with the Egyptian authorities last year, regarding the tomb of Kaumudi's artifacts. And I can absolutely guarantee you, it was just a miscommunication. There's no need to explain yourself to me, Dr. Wells. Sounds like your reputation precedes you. Sounds like your reputation precedes you. What about the Kodek stone? Do you believe that's real? Kodek stone is a myth. Behar believed it was real. Based his entire career on it. Yeah, look where it got him. Anyone who believes the Kodek stone is real is a fool. - You talking to me? - Anyone. - What do they want? - It'll be nothing. Probably want to see our papers. And if they're a problem, I'm sure they can be persuaded. Papers, please. - Don't... - What? Cause any trouble. Leave that to me. They want to see all of our papers. Passport. Passport. Where's my passport? - Calm down, bookworm. - What? And try to breathe every once in a while. Passport, Dr. Wells. I trust everything is in order. On your way, be careful. People have been known to go missing. Although it would be very bad for such a pretty lady never to be seen again. What's got you looking so worried? I always look worried. Probably because I'm always worried. You shouldn't be. I might not like Cooper, but he knows what he's doing. You've seen Behar's footage, right? Yeah. - I think he was onto something. - Yeah. Just got me so worried. Let's get back on the road. Everyone out. Ladies first. Never claimed I was a lady, but I appreciate the offer. Eyes on the prize, Jack, not the ass. Look like a prize to me. Who's the Egyptian? He's your guide, Rashid Hassan and he comes highly recommended, so try not to insult him. Do my best. He was a leading figure with the rebels who overthrew Hosni Mubarak. What's he doing here in the ass end of nowhere? Some of his views were considered by many as extreme. Let's say he just needed a change of air. Can we trust him? I don't know about that, but he knows this cursed earth better than any man alive. I'd like you in the lead with Hassan. I think I'll join in. Jack Wells, Egyptologist. Hassan. Dr. Behar was very passionate man. What he didn't know about Siptah, Neferu wasn't worth knowing. You knew him well, then? Yes, ever since I was young boy. My father was his guide, and I took over. So, you took him into the cursed earth? Yes, many time. He was constantly searching for the tomb. And when he went missing? On that instance, the good doctor ventured out alone. He didn't want anyone to know his location. With age he grew paranoid. He believed everyone was out to steal the find from him. Take the glory. What do you think happened to him, Hassan? The cursed earth is not the safest place for a man to walk. He could have easily been turned around in a sand storm, died of exposure. You believe that? Sand is very hungry, Dr. Wells. If you don't tread carefully, it will bite. Welcome to the cursed earth, Jack. I can think of places, I'd rather be. We all could. Maybe when we're done here. Is that a come on, Dr. Wells? Jack, call me Jack. I hate all that "Doctor" bullshit. Okay, Jack. Maybe when we're done. I don't believe this. Come, once you've unpacked and set up camp I've arranged for food. And then we sleep. We have much traveling to do tomorrow. What the hell's going on, Jack? We're about to find out. Seems like Hassan hasn't been greasing the right palms. It's just what we need. Put the gun down, you all, now. Let go of me! Your man touched me first! What seems to be the problem here? This is a restricted area, you must not be here. I can assure I've been granted full access to this area for myself and my team. You show me. It's time for you to take over. What the hell am I supposed to do? Exactly what I tell you, now get over there and sound authoritative. These are not valid. That's impossible, check them again. I'll deal with this. Not valid. You must go. Who are you? - Who I am is of no concern... Who I am is of no concern, - ... who I know is. - Who I know is. And who do you know? - Naseem Abubakar. - Naseem Abubakar. I see you know the name. Well, if you continue to fuck with me and my colleagues Naseem will fuck with you, understand? Don't, don't push it, Jack. On your way, but you may regret the decision later. From here, we will have to travel by foot. Why can't we just take the cars? Look for yourself. Beyond the horizon lies a cursed earth. The cursed earth. Yes, Dr. Wells. Behar's last GPS signal puts him within a day's travel of you current location. You're quite sure this is where Dr. Behar was heading? This is what he told me, yes. What made him think, he'd find Neferu's tomb out here? He did not say. But he knew, you could see it in his eyes. You okay there, Marty? Oh, I'm fine, this body was built for the great outdoors. I don't get you, Jack Wells. What's there to get? - I read about you. - And? Definitely makes for an interesting read. You studied at Harvard, you graduated the top of your class, and then you stepped straight into a job at the Archeological Institute of America... Oh, God! Thanks. Then you spent six years in Egypt, mostly working in Abu Rawash and that's when things got a little shady. It seems you were accused of falsifying King Tafari's seal? Accused, never convicted. Is there a difference? About eight to 15. Well, from what I've seen so far, you don't seem like that guy at all. Maybe I'll surprise you. Maybe. - I want you to look at something. What? - Something you've missed. - Where? - Over to the left. Okay, what am I looking at? You don't see it, do you? The rock formation. Look at the shape of that rock formation, they're the same as the one on Behar's video. We're close, so close I can taste it. The history books are vague. Most stating that Neferu was the worst of the two brothers. But there are many writings that purport to Siptah having been far more nasty. The writings are true. Both brothers were corrupt. But, no brother could do what Siptah did to Neferu without having evil in their veins. If what I've read about Neferu is true he deserved what he got. His army rode through Egypt, slaughtering everyone in its path. Power corrupts, my friend. And the brothers held more power in their hands than any man should ever hold. But Siptah, wasn't satisfied with sharing, he wanted it all to himself. So, he had his brother killed. That's not uncommon for the time though. Many pharaohs acquired their power through murder. There is murder and there is torture. Siptah ordered that Neferu be nailed to the ground and his chest be cut open while he was still breathing and then had salt poured onto his still beating heart. He was screaming for mercy, as they cut away his nose with a chisel and forced a barbed hook all the way up into his skull. Lady here needs a drink. Cooper. - We're getting close, Jack. - Over and out, Carl. I think it's time I turned off that little voice in my head. - Hey. - Hey. - You forgot this. - Oh... Who were you just talking to by the way? Oh, just a little voice in my head. You're not going to let me finish this by myself are you? I think there's something else I'd like to finish. Keeping your eyes on the prize, huh, Jack? Kind of hard not to. Ooh. - You're not getting shy on me now are you? - Get over here. I guess there could be worst places we could be. - Really? I can't think of any place I'd rather be. - Me, too. She's something else, Jack, isn't, she? - What the hell? - What? It's just the little voice in my head again. Sorry, three's a crowd. Hey, about last night. You don't have to say anything, Kate. I get it, it was what it was. You needed me and I needed you. Nothing more, nothing less. You really know how to treat a woman. Quit playing with the hired help, Wells, and get over here. Asshole. Me or him? - Both. She's growing on me. Piss off, Carl. Take a look at this, tell me what you think. What am I looking for? I just want your opinion. Dr. Cooper! Dr. Cooper! You're gonna want to see this. What it is, Baptiste? I was taking a leak and I think I found it. What you find, Greg, your cock? No, asshole, the entrance to the tomb. I found it. That's great! This is it people, this is the tomb of Neferu. I shall get camp ready. Good man, Hassan, good man. But this is clearly the same place as on Behar's video. Dr. Wells is right. This may be where Behar filmed his last footage. No proof this is the final resting place of Neferu. No proof yet, but there will be as soon as we get inside. If any of you still needed proof. What is it, Dr. Cooper? Hieroglyphics. And this right here, this is the katak, the eye of the jackal, it's the symbol of King Neferu. Oh, it's magnificent. This is the final resting place... Think about it, we could be the first eyes cast upon his name in over 2,000 years. Unless Behar saw it before us. I've got to record this. Kate, - are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Wells, I need... We need your assistance. You'll be okay? I'm a big girl, Jack. Go do your job. You heard the lady, show me something exciting. - What does it say? - Enlighten us. This is rough. It's a dialect I've not seen before. But you can read it, right, Jack? Yeah, just give me a minute. I hope I haven't wasted funds, bringing you along. You really don't like me do you, Cooper? This has nothing to do with my personal feelings towards you. Can you decipher the glyphs or not? Here lies the cursed king under the heel of Anubis and body on Aken's ferry, the soul in between. It's amazing, it's simply amazing. Is that the exact translation, Wells? Words to that effect. There's more over here. The tilasm will keep him in the tomb. A tealsman? That's Arabic, for the talisman. Is it talking about the Kodek stone? Siptah buried his brother with that. He had to keep Neferu's soul from coming back and avenging himself. This is where the Kodek stone enters the history books. This is all getting to be a bit unreal. Not for the ancient Egyptians, it wasn't. The Kodek stone was very real to them. It meant to hold great power, mystical power. And you believe that crap? Not at all. But, I do believe this is the tomb Behar spent his life looking for. Let's get moving, people. Okay, I'm starting to feel that we're lost. We're not lost, Greg. We're discovering. Greg. - Yeah? Keep an eye on Wells. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Okay. - Good. Carl? Are you there? Always. Until you get that stone, you're stuck with me. I wanna show you something. Something I didn't share with the others. I saved all the images from earlier. I had a few experts look them over and they all agree with you. About the talisman keeping Neferu in the tomb. Yeah, well you didn't get to see everything earlier. Are you keeping secrets from me, Jack? I didn't think you'd want me sharing this with the rest of the group. I, I don't see anything. 'Cause you're not looking close enough. The others missed it in their excitement. What does it say, Jack? Talks about a passageway in the heart of the tomb. And, and it's unclear. Can't make it out. Is it about the Kodek stone? Yes. "The talisman, "placed in the heart cavity of the cursed king "to keep him in perpetual torment. " And, that means... That means, we find Neferu's mummy, we find your goddamn stone. What the hell is going on? Your guess is good as mine. Son of a bitch. They're taking my laptop, Jack. Tell them to go. - That equipment is... Hey! She will come with us! She will come with us! Not so fast, asshole. Jack! -We need that equipment, Wells. Fuck your equipment, Cooper. So much for mentioning Naseem's name. I thought you knew him! I do and I can assure you that we'll be having words. Words? You better have more than words, Carl. If I didn't know you better, Jack, I'd think you had feelings for the girl. Shit! Your little bitch is quite a handful. I told you to let her go. She shot my man! Can't say I blame her. Jack, just shoot him. Shut up. So, are we gonna tell someone? What are you doing? I think it would be wise if we left camp. What are you talking about, Coop? It's Cooper. Dr. Cooper. Oh, okay. I'll ask again. What the fuck do you mean, Cooper? Decided we're leaving and we will return when things around here are safer for us to continue our work. - Unacceptable. - Safer? Cooper, this is the Middle East. When exactly do you think things are ever gonna be safer around here? We all discussed it. It's for the best. Well, nobody discussed it with me. I didn't think it was necessary to discuss it with you, Wells. Tell me you are not okay with this. Hey, I'm just the hired help. I follow the money. Load the rest of the gear up on the jeep. Shit. We're not going anywhere. Some son of a bitch just cut the... What was that? Hassan! Wait for us, Wells. Radio for help. We don't have time to wait. Jack, talk to me. What the hell is going on there? Shit! Kate! It's not deep. It looks worse than it is. Can you stand? Yeah, I'll be all right. Dr. Cooper? Dr. Cooper. The radios, they... Slow down, kid. Try and breathe. You okay? The radios and satellite phones are trashed. So, we're fucked. Shit. Jack! What was that? Oh, my God, get in here! Oh, my God, Wells! Dr. Cooper. Jack. Dr. Wells. - Jack... You still there? Where's Marty? Jack? He's over here. He's trapped. His hand is stuck. Looks bad. - Oh, Jesus Christ! - We gotta get him out. I can have a rescue team to you in 12 hours. Just get the stone first. Let me take a look. So now you're a medical doctor? I'm just trying to help. You know, it's okay to pull that stick out of your ass every once in a while, Cooper. Fine. This does not look good. What are we gonna do? We're gonna get him free, then we're gonna find Kate. Kate? Seems like we have more pressing issues than finding Kate. Stop. - What? You're gonna bring the whole place down on our heads. We can't leave Marty. We're not leaving anyone. What are you doing? I'm gonna try to pull him free. Are you insane? This whole place is gonna come down any moment now. We gotta get you out of here. Don't. I'm not gonna lie to you, it's gonna hurt. A hell lot of a worse before it gets any better. Shit. How bad? Bad, kid. Pretty fucking bad. Give me your wallet, Coop. My wallet? What do you want with my wallet? Just give him your fucking wallet! I don't give a shit if he wants a tip. Just get me the fuck out of here. You might wanna bite down on this. Why? It's better than biting your tongue off. This is not gonna be fun, kid. Don't, don't tell me about it, just do it. Greg, on three. You got that, Coop? One, two, three! Any news on that rescue team? Any news on my stone? You'll get your fucking stone as soon as I know Kate is safe. But, I wanna know that team is on its way. I'll make the call. Think of it as a gesture of goodwill. One of these days, Carl, I'm gonna kill you. Join the line, Jack, join the line. Is he ready to move? He's lost a lot of blood. I know. But, is he ready? I'm ready. Can you stand up? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's get you up. What now? Our options are pretty limited, but I suggest we get moving. You know, I said we should have left. If we had, we wouldn't be in this situation. Yeah, and Marty would still have two arms. We can't change that either. I told them we should've hired someone else. Don't try putting this shit on me, Cooper. It's okay, buddy, we're gonna get you out of here. Your act doesn't fool anyone, Wells. What fucking act? We all know about your past. Me better than most. Or have you forgotten about Abu Rawash? That has nothing to do with what's happening here. You sure about that? I'm sure the Kodek stone is a huge temptation for you. We'll finish this later, Cooper. But, right now, Kate is the priority. And the stone, Jack. Don't forget the stone. Fuck you and fuck your stone. It all looks the same. Is there water in that canteen? Some. Give it to me. Stop complaining, Cooper. Wells, Wells, wait. We need to rest. Marty doesn't look very good. Marty? So thirsty. Can't breathe. How much water you got left? Why? It's my water. Whatever you got, you give half to Marty. Get him comfortable. And, if Cooper holds out on the water, you punch him in the face. I'm gonna scout ahead and see if I can get some bearings on a way out. Wait. Hey, wait! You'll be back, right? Half an hour, tops. I was wondering when you were going to dump that dead weight. Well, I might be lying to them, but I have no intention of dumping them. So what's the plan? I've been walking them in a circle for the last 15 minutes. Why? Because I saw something that I wanted to take a closer look at. What is it, Jack? It's interesting. Talk to me, Jack. It's a coded map. On where? - To find the stone? - Yeah. And how to get the fuck out of here. Looks like you have to go through the burial chamber before we'll find the exit. Shit. Shit! Thank God, it's you. He's back. Wells? Yeah, it's me. And I brought a friend. - Hey. - Hey. Tell me you found a way out. I might've. You might have? What the hell does that mean? I found more writing. It looks like the slaves planned an escape at some point. And they mapped the structure out in code. It tells how we must go through the heart of the tomb, to reach salvation. The heart? I think it's talking about the burial chamber. I know what it means, Wells. Christ, that means we have to go deeper. It's the best chance we've got right now. Unless you wanna wander around here aimlessly until we run out of water. Shit. How you doing, kid? Stopped wanting to vomit. That's a plus. You ready to make a move? Kate has something to show us. Shortcut to the exit, I hope. No, but I think I found Behar. Or at least what's left of him. Oh, my God. What happened to him? Poor guy. Had to guess, I'd say Hassan happened to him. You'll be okay for a minute? Yeah. His heart's gone. Yeah. Whatever took his heart had his brain at the same time. What if he explored the tomb before he made the video? He may have the stone. If this was Hassan's handiwork, he is one sick bastard. What are you looking for? I'm looking for anything that might help us. Now, this is more like it. - The stone? - Dynamite. What if Behar did enter the tomb? What if he had, it changed nothing. He'd still be dead, we'd still be trapped. What if he found the stone? What, and Neferu wants it back? Just listen for a minute, will you? What if he found the stone and Hassan killed him for it? For a man who has no interest in the Kodek stone, you talk about it quite a lot. That's because our lives might depend on it. Canopic jars. We must be close. It's an antechamber. What's going on, Jack? I'm still blind on this end. And you haven't spoken for over an hour. Careful! It's empty. Supposedly, Siptah had Neferu's organs destroyed, so he couldn't take them to the afterlife. The jars that you are about to drop... Were left as a further insult. Can you feel that? Feel what? It's fresh air. It's faint, but I can feel it. I feel it. Fresh air means a way out, right? Maybe. Hey, guys. Over here. There's an opening. There's another chamber on the far side, larger than this one. What about the air? It's definitely breezy. Looks safe enough. - It's in and out, Kate. - All you gotta do is breathe. And you'll be waiting for me on the other side? You want me to go first? You promise to follow? I'll make sure she does. And you're okay bringing up the rear? It's better I go last. You don't want me collapsing halfway through and blocking up the passage. Don't even joke about it, Marty. Come on, guys! Just remember, breathe. Come on, Doc. It's easy. No more than 30 feet, Kate. Just keep moving. What's going on, Jack? I'm trying to get out of this mess alive. What are you doing, Jack? I mean it, Jack. No stone, no rescue team. If I get out of here, you're gonna need a rescue team after I hunt you down. I'm harder to find than you think. Rochester Hotel, 336. You're not the only one with resources, Carl. We're almost there, Doc. Come on! - Okay, Kate. - Just close your eyes. Feel your way along. Nothing to it. That's easy for you to say. I'm going as fast as I can. Almost there. You're full of shit, Jack. Shit! Jack? Come on, Kate, 6 feet! I can't. - Wells. - Fuck off, Coop. Kate? I can't. Fucking look at me! Now, follow me. You still there, Marty? Get me out of here, Dr. Wells! Now, I need you to hold on there, Marty. I don't wanna be left down here, not alone, not to die. Don't you even think about that, Marty. I'm getting you out of here, and we're gonna get you a new arm, you hear me? I've got a friend whose gonna get you the best arm money can buy. - His name's Carl. - Not funny, Jack. I don't like it down here, Dr. Wells. I'm scared. You call me Dr. Wells again and I'll stop digging. The name is Jack. You call me Jack. Just get me out of here! You guys, quiet a minute. What is it? I don't know, didn't you hear it? Marty? - Did you hear that? Yeah, we heard it. I need you to try to get to us, can you do that, Marty? Yeah, I'll do my best. I just wanna go home. You and me both. I don't wanna die! Marty! Marty! You see anything? This fucking coward. Hassan, you son of a bitch. I'm not so sure that was Hassan. Who else could it have been? I mean, I lost him in the cave and we all saw what he was about to do to Marty. Yeah, but that doesn't convince me that it was Hassan with Marty this time. Who was it then, Wells? Neferu? Oh, no, go on, tell us. If it wasn't Hassan, who was it? I don't know. I didn't see it clearly. But it moved too fast to be... To be what? To be human. That's ridiculous. Do you see that light? Oh, shit. What is it? I think we just found... The burial chamber. It's definitely not what I expected. Neferu wasn't treated as a king. His brother wanted death to be an insult. What are you doing, Wells? What you brought me along to do, Coop. Decipher. What does it say? "Neferu's soul is held within the stone, "and the stone within, "Neferu. " What the hell does it mean? I don't know. Shh. Do you guys hear that? I'll keep my eye out. So, you wanna open it? You ready? Yeah. Yeah. - Let's do it. - Okay. Okay. Lift. Oh, fuck. Where the hell is Neferu? Did you find the stone? It's not here. What's not in here? The diamond? I know you're only here for that stone. You've been lying to us the whole time. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jack? Is that true? We're all getting paid to do a job. I'm just getting paid twice. You son of a bitch. I knew I never should have brought you along. If we're gonna get out of this mess, we're gonna have to do it together. No! Help! Are you okay? What the hell is going on, Jack? Yeah, good news is, I found your stone. Bad news is, it just walked away. We gotta get out of here. You will. Jack? Find a way out. There's rescue team on the way. What about you? I'm going back for Cooper. What about my stone? I'm coming with you. Just find the exit. I'll be right behind you. Now go. Go! What's your plan, Jack? I haven't got one. Jack? What's going on? Talk to me, Jack. Please don't do this. I am sorry. It is his will. No! It is done, My King. Jack, wake up, you son of a bitch... Oh, Jesus Christ. Shit, Jack, I'm glad to hear your voice. You might change your mind, when I tell you my fee just went up. Well, it's a bit late in the game for negotiating. Oh, yeah? Well, I charge extra when a cursed mummy is involved. Jack? Jack? Dr. Wells, you should've left when you had the chance. Untie me... ...and I'll leave right now. - No! It's too late for that. Neferu must take what was taken from him. You help him kill? His hold on me is too strong. And with each victim, he grows stronger. How many, Hassan? How many before us? Not enough to quench the King's hunger. Maybe, one day, he will sleep again. Until that day comes... I must serve him. I wish you safe travels into the next life. Doctor... Kate. I told you to get out of here. I bet you're glad I didn't listen. We have to get the fuck out of here before Neferu comes back. It must be a trick, being alive defies any logic. He's not alive, Kate, - he's hungry. - Shit! Oh, fuck. Run! Shh. So, where's this way out you were talking about? This way. There it is. The rescue team should be with you in the next two hours. They better be here in two minutes. Down, Jack! Duck! Keep digging. Whatever happens, just keep digging. Time to go nighty night, asshole. Jack? Jack! The Kodek stone. Beautiful isn't it? It's amazing. Isn't it? Yes, it's stunning. Neferu. Do you think he's still around? I'm not gonna stick around to find out. But, just in case he is... - What are you doing, Jack? - What are you doing? Keep it! -You can't do that. You, you son of a bitch. You're ruined, I'm gonna see to it, Jack Wells. Fuck you, Carl. Name. Carl Rosencane. Profession. A little this, a little that. Do you own ItraCorp Intel, Mr. Rosencane? Oh, that's among many of the things that I own. I'll take that as a yes. Take it as you will. But make this as quick as possible. Have you had any dealings with the Egyptian government as of late, Mr. Rosencane? I have many dealings with many governments. Would you care to elaborate? Are you aware of the disappearance of an archeological team outside of Hijaza? Dr. Jeremy Cooper, Dr. Jack Wells, Kate Alvarez, Marty Timor, Greg Baptiste. We've been informed that you may have participated in their disappearance. I'd love to know where you get your information. Our sources are none of your concern, Mr. Rosencane. What is of our concern is the disappearance of five American citizens and the involvement that ItraCorp Intel might have played in said disappearance. ItraCorp Intel is a legitimate company. I have nothing to do with anybody's disappearance. To believe otherwise would be absolutely ludicrous. What would I have to gain? What do you know about the Kodek stone, Mr. Rosencane? Jack, you son of a bitch. I want my lawyer. Now, God damn it!
