The crossroads of the Far East. lts population, a mixture of all races and nationalities, mostly Chinese. Macao, often called the Monte Carlo of the Orient, has two faces, one calm and open, the other veiled and secret. Here, millions in gold and diamonds change hands. Some across the gambling tables, some mysteriously in the night. Macao is a fugitives haven, for at the three-mile limit the authority of the lnternational Police comes to an end. This is all we found on the body, sir. Commander Stewarts office. What? Oh, yes. They have the police commissioner in New York, sir. Hello? Hello? Commissioner? Commander Stewart here, lnternational Police, Hong Kong. lm afraid l have bad news for you. Your man, Lombardy... Detective Lieutenant Daniel Lombardy? Hes been murdered. Body found in our waters with a knife in his back. -lts too hot. -Here, thisll cool you off. No, no more of that. Now take it easy. That wasnt the way you talked in Hong Kong this morning. Buy you a ticket, you said, Well have a few laughs. lf its laughs you want, you just sit there. lll tell you a few jokes. Did you ever hear the one about the man... Now, dont get physical. -Which one of you is Cinderella? -Get out of here. -Stick around. -Beat it! -lm the one thats getting out of here. -When lm ready. Will you get out of here and close that door? -Would you mind giving me a hand? -Dont think l wouldnt enjoy that. -Let me go! -lll slug you, so help me, lll slug you. -Now, now, fold up your tent. -Why, you stupid... Whats your rush? Stick around. Music, whiskey, privacy. Stick around. Looks like a party. Come on. Dont tell me youre that exclusive. One side, Clyde. -Some girls dont think lm so bad. -lts all a matter of taste. Okay, buster, now were even. Well be in soon. Only about 15 minutes late. Your first trip to Macao? -From what l hear, once is once too often. -Yeah, so lve heard. But when youre in business, like l am, you have to go where they send you. -Why are you making the trip? -You got any small questions? Like the wife says, l talk too much. Thats all right. l just dont warm up to questions when l dont know the answers myself. l saw you when you got on at Hong Kong. ld like to introduce myself. My names Trumble. Lawrence C. Trumble. Dealer in coconut oil, pearl buttons, fertilizer and nylon hose. Well, no sale on your other lines, Mr. Trumble, but did l hear you mention nylons? -Size nine? -Size nine. -Wait a minute. Not so fast. How much? -For free. No strings attached. -Well, the price is right. -Our special for today. lll never believe another traveling salesman story. -Oh, excuse me. -Oh, yes. Enjoy the view? Well, its not the Taj Mahal or the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, but its not bad. Did anyone ever tell you what big blue eyes you have, Grandma? -My names Trumble, Mr... -Cochrane. l want you to meet an old friend of mine, Miss... Miss... Your old friends name is Julie Benton, and thanks again, Mr. Trumble. -Looks like you made a big hit. -My fatal charm. Never misses, except with women. -Excuse me. -Yeah. Those two are mine. One, two, three, four, five, six. Chop, chop! Hey. You got a match? This is one of those days when the customs will make us sweat. Every time you enter port around these parts they go through your bags as though they have nothing else to do. They havent. Youre not smuggling anything in, are you? The way l hear it, you smuggle things out of here, not in. Your passport, please. -How long do you plan to be here? -Your guess is as good as mine. -How long were you in Hong Kong? -Three weeks. What were you doing there? You dont really want me to tell you, do you? Where were you before you came to Hong Kong? Saigon. -How long were you in Saigon? -What are you, a cop? lf youre all through throwing my stuff around, ld like to get out of here. Maybe you dont mind baking in this oven, but l do. How much money are you bringing with you, seora? $29 Mex and a handful of Hong Kong paper. Hardly enough for an extended stay. lm gonna get a job. Do you mind? -What sort of a job? -lm a singer. -l wish you luck, seora. -Thanks. Your passport, please. Thats me, Lawrence C. Trumble, Manila. Dealer in coconut oil, pearl buttons, nylon hose, fertilizer and cigars. -Any contraband? -Best in the world. -Try some. -Thank you. Any currency? 500 greenbacks printed in the USA. Hope to have a lot more if the dice get as hot as the weather. ln Macao everything is a gamble. Good luck. Your passport, seor. Your passport, seor! You look like the kind of a man who admires frankness, so lm gonna tell you the truth. l lost it. lm afraid, seor, youll have to report to the police at once. Dont let me drag you away from the line of duty, but l was told to report to you. lm Lieutenant Jose Felizardo Espirito Sebastian, at your service. My wallet was in my pocket when l boarded that tub at Hong Kong, but somebody lifted it. -That is most unfortunate, seor. -Well, what happens now? Do l get deported or thrown in the clink? Neither, seor. This is a Portuguese colony. Always friendly and hospitable. Have you any other means of identification? Yeah. This took me three years, five months and 26 days to get. You served as a lieutenant in the Signal Corps of the United States. Unfortunately, Seor Cochrane, this finely engraved document does not grant you the privilege of traveling free as a bird -throughout the Orient. -l was afraid of that. l suggest you contact your consulate in Hong Kong. How long did you intend to remain in our city? -That depends. -On what? On a certain female. Lady luck. l wish you well. lt is our fond hope that all visitors to Macao should feel as untroubled here as Adam in the garden of Eden. Untroubled? That aint the way l heard it. This is the Rua da Felicidade. Mucho fun. Win plenty money. Fan Tan, dice, big gambling. Here come biggest gambling house. -lts run by American gentleman. -Yeah? Whats his name? Mr. Vincent Halloran. Very important man. Big boss. -Whats he boss of? -What he is boss of? Most of Macao. This his place. Ling Tan the merchant wants chips for this. Claims it is worth 2,000. Offer him 700. Did your cousin arrive on the noon ferry? lf he had, he would be here by now. lt shouldnt take five days to sell a $100,000 necklace in Hong Kong and come back, if hes coming back. -Hes always returned before. -Thats what l mean. You dont want that junk. Diamonds would only cheapen you. Yeah. But what a way to be cheapened. As l anticipated, my connections in Hong Kong were right. No uniform, no badge, no credentials but l spotted him like that. Stop taking bows and lets see what he looks like. These passengers we already know. These three are newcomers. Doesnt a murder charge ever get outlawed? He will not be as easy as the last one. He looks easy enough. Oh, this is just a salesman, Trumble of Manila. This is the New York detective. Where is he now? Headquarters? No. Nor do l think he will ever visit the police. He calls himself Nick Cochrane. Hes at the Portugueza, pretending to be without money or passport. Did you talk to him at all? He insisted on concealing his identity, so l played his little game. Obviously he has a plan to take you back to New York illegally. This will happen over my dead body. Thats what l like about you, Sebastian. Your unselfishness. -Think shes hooked up with him? -Why? -Wheres she staying? -At his hotel. -Did they seem to know each other? -l dont think so. What does she say shes here for? Besides her obvious talents, she also sings. l happen to need a singer. -Are you an American? -Yeah, whats on your mind? ls this really American money? -Where did you get this? -From an American lady down the hall. Yeah its the McCoy, all right, but you do me a favor and hang on to it, will you? ld like to buy it back from you. -There isnt enough for both of us. -My sentiments exactly. -Now what about the wallet, honey? -l dont know what youre talking about. You just gave the bellboy a $2 bill that was part of a short snorter that l carried all through the war. Get out of my room. Look, honey, lve had a hard day. Now just give me the wallet and well forget the whole thing. lve already forgotten it. Shove. Seora... Seor Cochrane. You save me the need for a visit. lt has become necessary to enforce our laws against vagrancy. Since you are without funds you will leave Macao at the first opportunity. My regrets, seor. Whats that got to do with your barging in here? You will let me explain, seora. l am not here to see you in my official capacity. l ought to make you apologize. Havent you lost a little weight since l saw you last? -Now will you get out of here? -ln a moment, seora. But first, please allow me to be of some small service to you. -lve heard that one before. -Oh, you misunderstand. Okay, what is it? l was at the dock when l heard you say that you are a singer. Felizardo, l said to myself, Here is a beautiful young lady to grace the dull existence of Macao. So being a man with a practical side to my nature, l hurried to Seor Vincent Halloran, owner of the largest gambling establishment on the island. Vincent, l said, our friendship is at an end, unless you give this young lady a chance. -Does that mean youve got a job for me? -Precisely. Why didnt you say so? Your pardon, seora, how soon can you be at his office? As soon as you get out of here, l can get dressed. Goodbye, Miss Benton. lt is indeed a pleasure to welcome a young lady graced with such beauty of... Yeah, yeah, officer, me too. Where can l get a shave? Our hotel has the finest barber in the Orient. This way. l didnt see any phone in my room. How do you call Hong Kong? There is no telephone connection with Hong Kong. lf you wish to cable, the phone at my desk is at your disposal. l was just curious. What time do the gambling halls open? They never close. Me wants a shavey, easy side, chop, chop. Who do you like this year? The Giants or the Dodgers? Wherell l find Mr. Halloran? He sent for me. Youll find him in his office up those stairs. Thanks. ls Mr. Halloran in? Hello. That policeman friend of yours said you might have a job for me. -l might. Miss Benton, isnt it? -Yeah. lve heard that all roads lead to Macao. But why did you wanna come here? l was left a legacy and l wanted to see the world. -Cigarette? -No, thanks. You must meet a great number of people on your travels. This fellow, for instance? Sure. -Who is he? -My grandfather. My mother wont let me go anywhere without a chaperone. l thought maybe he was part of your seeing the world. l just met him on the boat. Now that your legacy has been used up, you need a job? Listen, you sent for me. This wasnt my idea. Well get along better if you take that chip off your shoulder. lt wont do you any good here. Never did me any good any place. -Where have you been singing? -Everywhere. -l mean, recently. -Hong Kong, till the boss got ideas. l can easily see why. Shall we say 100 a week? l could sing better for 150. My patrons come here to gamble. lll pay you 100. Think it over. l just did. When do l start? Call Gimpy. -How about two weeks salary in advance? -This is one time l wont say no. This fellow you met on the boat, what does he do for a living? l wouldnt know. Why dont you ask him? Gimpy, Miss Bentons gonna sing here. -That is fine, Miss Benton. -Glad to know you. -Whats your real name? -Gimpy. Everyone calls him that. Dont they, Gimpy? Yes, sir. See that she gets something to wear that does her justice. Yes, sir. -Thanks, Mr. Halloran. -Try calling me Vince. Okay, Boss. You got a match, lady? -Hi. Whatre you doing here? -Oh, just looking around. -Dont tell me youve landed a job. -Theres my piano player. Come into my room when youre ready, Miss Benton. Come in. This man wants to see you. -Anything l can do for you, Mr. Cochrane? -How about a light? Go ahead. Whats your problem? Need a check cashed? l need a bank account. Whats my picture doing on your desk? l like to keep posted on every potential customer. ld like to work on the other side of the table. l dont suppose youd have a job for me? What kind of training have you had for a job around here? Well, l worked in a gambling house in Singapore. -Whyd you quit? -Broke a house rule. -l let a heavy bettor win. -The same house rule applies here. After Singapore? After Singapore, l nursemaided a shipment of machine guns to lraq. Then l went on to Cairo, got rid of a handful of stones for a couple of refugees who wanted visas. That dough l blew on slow horses. Worked my way back to China on a freighter. Here l am, broke, ready to go on the payroll. Doing what? Maybe you could use a skipper on your trips to Hong Kong? l can sail anything that floats. You must have heard, l never go beyond the three-mile limit. -Didnt they tell you in New York? -l left New York five years ago. -Really, Lieutenant? -Why the Lieutenant? My friend Lieutenant Sebastian of the police told me of your commission in the army. Now theres a job you might have talent for, on the police force. lm not partial to the law. As a matter of fact, thats why l left the States. -l got into a little jam back there. -How long ago was that? l just told you. Five years ago in New York. -What kind of a jam? Kill someone? -No. Youd probably call it smalltime stuff. Smuggling arms, getting rid of hot jewelry? Thats too bigtime for me. Sorry l cant do anything for you, Lieutenant. lll try one of the spots down the street. You cant get a job in this town. Why dont you be smart and grab the next boat back to Hong Kong? Whos gonna provide the finances? lll be glad to give that some thought. You fabulous character, you l dont know what it is that you do But you have the power to make me laugh And the power to break my heart in half You kill me You knock me out You had me the moment you smiled You kill me No, theres no doubt Youre certainly driving me wild Youve got that "oh how l need you" expression What a confession that is Baby lm on the spot Tell me youre not Giving me the business lm certain lm positive lm sure that my love will survive Because you kill me And keep me so alive Youve got that "oh how l need you" expression What a confession that is Baby lm on the spot Tell me youre not Giving me the business lm certain lm positive lm so sure that my love will survive Because you thrill me Baby, you kill me And keep me so alive -Are they always that enthusiastic? -Always. Try again, Mr. Trumble? Sure. The nights young and lve got plenty of cabbage. Come on, Nick. This Chinese three-dice game is a pushover. All you do is bet on high, low or the number of points that come up. No, thanks. Seventeen high! Well, easy come, easy go. Are you sure you wont try your luck? Not the way its running. Why not, Mr. Cochrane? l have a feeling this is your night. Bet on three of a kind, you get 35 to one. Three sixes for instance. -How often does that come up? -l have a hunch it might happen right now. Three sixes. Shoot the works. -Would you like some fresh dice? -You know them better than l do. Three sixes. My, lady luck didnt just smile at you, brother, she got hysterical! Pay Mr. Cochrane $350. Let it ride, Lieutenant. On the triple six. The man says let it ride. -Same dice? -Same dice, if you dont mind. Three sixes. l see it, but dont believe it. Six sixes in a row. Thirty-five times 350. Pay the man $12,250. Why stop now? -Dont tell me to let it all ride. -Why not? Triple-six and youre rich. Dont look at me. Heres the $20 l owe you. Let the rest of it ride. Two sixes and a two. You owe me $20. Thats what happens when you press your luck. Would you like these for a souvenir? -Any other ideas to liven up the evening? -Possibly. Mala, 50 cents on three sixes. What can l lose? Arent you taking the advice l gave you this afternoon? About going back to Hong Kong? What do l use for money? -lf youd won that last throw of the dice... -lf is the story of my life, Mr. Halloran. You know, you could have kept $12,000. -Half of that ought to interest you. -lt does. The money and your ticket to Hong Kong will be here in my office tomorrow. ln time to take the noon ferry. Alone. Rickshaw! -Hi. -Hey. -How did you do? -l dont know yet. Did you catch my act? l didnt exactly fracture the people, did l? Oh, ld say you were doing all right for yourself. How about a lift? Hop in. Now what would Mr. Halloran say? Look, lll choose my own friends, if you dont mind. All right, l apologize. Skip it. Why dont you take that chip off your shoulder? Every time l do somebody hits me over the head with it. l said l was sorry. l never got around to thanking you for giving Sebastian that body block. -You dont have to thank me. -l know l dont. lt was my money in the first place. Thanks, anyway. What made you do it? l dont know. When he started throwing his weight around, l guess l felt sorry for you. lve been in jams like that myself. You got anything special to do tonight? Why dont we go for a ride around the harbor in a sampan? Why not? So then you decided to become a singer? No. No, l didnt start singing professionally until after l quit being a fortune teller. -Fortune teller? Youre kidding. -No. l worked in the night clubs in Miami. First as a photographer and then as a cigarette girl. You know, long black mesh stockings and a short velvet skirt. Then they told me l could make more money as a fortune teller, so... What did you know about telling fortunes? Nothing. Here, give me your hand. l see that youve been very lonely and that youre worried about money and theres something in your past that you regret very much and youve been looking for something for a long, long time. -Guilty. -Not just you, everybody. Everybodys lonely and worried and sorry. Everybodys looking for something. -You, too? -Sure. Yeah. Yeah, when lm in action, l manage to push it out of my mind. But every now and then, like right now l... -What are you looking for? -l dont know. l dont know whether its a person or a place, -but l go right on looking. -Well, there are lots of places. l found one on an island called Rangdavi in the Melanesians. -Did you ever hear of it? -No. Great. Clean white beach, beautiful bay, green hills. Friend of mine owns a plantation there. He offered me a job as manager. And you turned him down? lve been lonely in Times Square on New Years Eve. Being on an island all by myself, l figured ld go crazy. ld have taken it. -You mean, youd go for a life like that? -Like a shot. -Julie. -lm listening. Look, l know this is... l know this is a little abrupt. l dont carry a lot of credentials around with me but lm fairly honest. lve done a lot of things in my life... -Running a plantations hard work. -lm not afraid of hard work. -Youre not kidding, are you? -No. -When, Nick? When? -When? l can leave tomorrow. Theres another Rangdavi. lll find it. As soon as l get there, lll send for you. We can meet in a month. Thirty days. Whats the matter? Take me back to the hotel, will you? lts getting cold. -Why? -l wanna get off this yacht, now. Turn this thing around, will you? Come in. -Greetings! -Beware of Greeks bearing gifts. Whos been sending you posies? The only time lll ever get flowers will be at my funeral. lll bet you the 20 l owe you youll never guess who sent these. No bet. l should have left with you last night. -Went to the cleaners, huh? -Yeah, and how. Too bad you didnt hit that last triple six. l can still pick up half the dough l won on that second roll. Yeah? How? All l have to do is collect $6,000 from Halloran and take the noon boat. -All l have to do is believe you. -No, lm serious. You mean to tell me Halloran is willing to give you all that moolah just to get out of town? Thats what the man says. For that kind of dough, ld swim back to Hong Kong. -Whats his angle? -He wants a clear field with Julie, l guess. Figures hell make a big man out of himself with her by riding me out of town on a golden rail. -What time are you leaving? -lm not. As long as youre gonna stay, you and l can go into business together. What are we gonna use for capital? Would that do? Belongs to a necklace of 14-carat stones. Twenty of them. All perfect. -Whered you get it? -Sideline. The necklace is in Hong Kong in a safe at The Grand Hotel. -Sizzles like a fried egg. -lts cool enough to be sold. lts worth a 100,000. lll take 40,000. Why do you want a middleman? l dont wanna mix it up with my legitimate business. Now where am l going to find some sweet old dowager wholl just hand me $40,000 and no questions asked? -l figure Halloran. -lm listening. Tell him where the rest of the necklace is. lf he wants to make a deal, its got to be cash, in your hands, in Hong Kong. -How do you know l wont run out on you? -l dont. -The lady of the loaded dice. -Youre up early for a loser. You cant make a dishonest dollar lying in bed. ls Halloran around? Mr. Halloran is busy counting out your dowry. -You ready to leave? -Unless youve got a better offer. lt wont buy a ticket to Hong Kong. You suppose you could tear yourself away from me -long enough to tell the boss lm here? -Whats your hurry? This has been burning a hole in my pocket. -How long have you had that? -lts part of the old family fortune. My calling card. l hear youve come into money. You mean this little trinket? lts nothing, really. This usually hangs on for dear life to a necklace of 20 flawless 14-carat diamonds. -Where did you pick it up? -ln a silk hat. l use diamonds instead of rabbits. -How much for the works? -lll let them find a new home for $40,000. lm always in the market for first-rate stuff. Like it? l always have. -Wheres the rest of the necklace? -l left it in Hong Kong. -Careless of me, wasnt it? -lt all depends. We might make a deal. Why dont you pick up the necklace and bring it back here? The deal has to be made in Hong Kong. -ltzumi, you feel like a trip? -The boats in order, sir. Do you think thats such a good idea, going off on a blind date with a hatchet-man? -Oh, you want me to go with you? -lf you want the necklace. Come in. -Howd you make out? -Were in business. -Price okay, huh? -No argument. lm meeting Halloran at the dock at 9:30 tonight and were taking his boat. -Be careful. His crew might jump you. -There wont be any crew. The two of us are going alone. Nice work. l was just going to ask you where l could borrow one. Sideline. Heres the key to my box in the safe at The Grand Hotel. Ask for Mr. Stewart. lll cable him youre coming. l ought to be back by morning. By the way, ever think of going home? l cant go home any more than you can, even if l wanted to. Why not? Little hassle over a redhead. Somebody fired a shot. lt turned out to be me. -The other guy get killed? -No. But l got all the way to China before l found that out. Then l just kept on going. A smart guy would go home and face the music. Thats great advice coming from you. l dont see you trying to clear up your own record. lll go back one of these days or my name isnt Lawrence C. Trumble. What does the C stand for? -Cicero. But keep it under your hat. -What else would l do with it? -Thanks for the flowers. -l couldnt afford a wreath. -What happened with you last night? -Nothing. Nothing? You mean you just turn it on, turn it off. And nothing, eh? -lm a creature of moods. -What did l do? Look at him. Hes only a boy. Now wait a minute. Tell me what l did. Well, youre registered, thats all. l thought you were something special and suddenly youre registered. l said to myself, Oh, that kind. lve got a whole cigar box full of that kind. You know, youre wrong. lll see you in a month. -Listen to me, will you? -Oh, come now. lt wont be a month. l wasnt trying any routine last night, believe me. l wish l could believe you. Sometimes l get so tired just remembering to keep my guard up. Lets go someplace where we can sit down and cool off and talk. l cant. Gimpys waiting. l have to rehearse. -Maybe after the show. -lm going to Hong Kong tonight. lll be back tomorrow. -How come? -Deal. lf it works out, well have all the money we need. Are you sure you have to rehearse right now? Pretty sure. -When are you leaving? -ln a couple of hours. -Will l see you tomorrow? -You try not to and see what happens. ln the meantime, see if you can manage to stay away from Halloran. -Never touch the stuff. -Quick Reward. Ahoy there! Are they biting today? l heard there were sharks out here but lm willing to settle for a sardine. Careful of the sun. How about coming on board for a drink and some shade? You dont have to ask me twice. Here we are. Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Bryan of the New York police department. -Mr. Chang. -Mr. Chang. -Mr. Alvaris of the lnternational Police. -Mr. Alvaris. -How about a drink? -Why not? We have been watching for you for two days. First chance lve had to get away. You fellows from the States dont care how far you sling your nets to catch one fish. Well, this ones a whopper. Weve been after him for two years. -How do you like my boat? -Looks okay. -l didnt keep you waiting? -No, no, l just got here myself. lf youre looking for your girlfriend, she wont be with you tonight. You know about last night, huh? Thats the trouble with women. They talk too much. How do you suppose lm making out with her? Lets go aboard. What a cheap police trick. Thought l wouldnt recognize the stuff l sent to Hong Kong only a week ago. Risk the three-mile limit? Not me. -You sent for me, O Genghis Khan? -You dont mind, do you? Sit down. What are you celebrating tonight? Well have a drink, then go on my boat and lll tell you all about it. lll take a rain check for that boat ride. Maybe you prefer a sampan. Maybe, Mr. Halloran. How long did it take you to call him Nick, last night? Look, Julie, l like you. So let me set you straight on Mr. Nick Cochrane. Hes a detective lieutenant sent out from New York with orders to bring me back. He was making a play for you so youd help him get close to me. -l dont believe you. -What makes you think lm a liar? l wanna hear what Nick has to say when he gets back tomorrow. lt ought to be very interesting. When youve made up your mind about him, let me know. lll be waiting. -Arent you afraid of falling in the water? -l live in a sampan like the others. You didnt hear a boat leave here in the last hour or so? A motorboat? You didnt hear anything? -l heard a fight. -Where? Something went wrong. -Whos been chasing you? -Whos been chasing me? Did you ever hear of the United States Marines? Assume that l have. What is it? To the Commissioner of Police, you are advised Mr. Nick Cochrane, an American, has been reported missing as of last night. We would appreciate your cooperation regarding his whereabouts. Signed by the American Consul in Hong Kong. -When did it arrive? -Fifteen minutes ago. How did the consul find out about Cochrane? All l know, the commissioner called us all in, gave me this cable, told me to find Cochrane or resign. Get on the phone. Find out who cabled the consulate. This is Lieutenant Felizardo Jose Espirito Sebastian. Take off the gold braid. This is Lieutenant Sebastian. l want the cable office. This is Lieutenant Sebastian. l want the list of everyone who sent a cable in the past 24 hours. A list! The entire list! Dont tell me not to scream ! lll scream as much as l please! How many went out, who sent them ! Every single name! No cables went out in the past 24 hours. Arent you afraid someone might hear you? l brought you some breakfast. lts the first time l ever saw a warden dolled up in a neglige. Who was it that tapped me into dreamland last night and rolled me for the diamond and the gun? Rice cakes? Delicious. All they left me was that set of loaded dice. You do remember these, dont you? How come they dragged me up here instead of dumping me in the bay? You know, you remind me of an old Egyptian girlfriend of mine. The sphinx. Are you partial to females made of stone? Good morning, Miss Benton. Did you sleep well? Who slept? -Mr. Cochrane hasnt returned yet, has he? -Not to my knowledge. Rickshaw! Rickshaw! -What is it? -Are we alone? ls anyone listening? Why? Are you a friend of the young American? Nick? Where is he? -Hes in trouble. -What trouble? lll tell you as we walk. Are you sure this is the place? Up those stairs, first door to your right. lf youre looking for your friend. -Whats he doing here? -Ever hear of the word privacy? Well, you certainly do get around, dont you? l just wanted to know if you were all right. Why dont you ask Margie? He was afraid to go home in the fog and my guest room was handy. You left out a few details, honey. -Did you find him? -Yes, l found him all right. Thanks. lts quarter to three Theres no one in the place except you and me So, set em up, Joe l got a little story you ought to know Were drinking, my friend To the end of a brief episode Make it one for my baby One more for the road You know the routine So put another nickel in the machine lm feeling so bad l hope you make the music dreamy and sad Could tell you a lot But youve gotta be true to your code Make it one for my baby One more for the road You never know it But, buddy, lm a kind of poet And lve got a lot of things to say And when lm gloomy You simply gotta listen to me Until its tucked away Well, thats how it goes And Joe, l know youre getting anxious to close So thanks for the beer l hope you didnt mind my bendin your ear This torch that lve found Must be drowned or it soon will explode Make it one for baby One more for the road That long Long, long Road l took this town and choked it with my bare hands until it coughed up. -You have gone far, Mr. Halloran. -Far? l cant go beyond the three-mile limit. And even with Cochrane under lock and key, l cant leave Macao until l know whos working with him. How did this diamond get away from my fence in Hong Kong? Who communicated with the American consul last night? What kind of a spy system have you got? lt was l who discovered that someone had used the shortwave on your boat. Congratulations. But who used it? Not Trumble. Not the girl. Weve got to make Cochrane talk. l beg of you.
