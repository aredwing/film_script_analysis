Let me help you. Mmh. Here it is. Would you like to book your return flight now? No. All right. I need your bags up here, please. I don't have any. Just the carry on. Okay, you're all set. You'll be leaving out of gate 43. Boarding begins in about an hour. Have a good flight. Hi. Step back up, please. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome aboard Ana. This is a co-shared flight with our star lines partners. Sir, are you sure you don't want anything to eat? Yeah, I'm not hungry. Please let us know if you change your mind. Hey. Hey! Excuse me. Hey. You okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you okay? Water? Easy. Slow, slow, slow. Are you lost? Yeah... I cannot find the way out. Please. Please help me. Okay, look. Listen to me. The trail is right there. Okay? Go that way. It will lead you out of here. Straight ahead. He didn't find the trail. Are you with anyone? Are you with anyone? No. Thank you. I have to find it. Okay, it must be this way. I walked that direction. I could not find any trail. You don't want to leave. I do. You came here alone. Please... I want to go home to my family. This way. Now listen, do you... Do you have a cell phone? It would not work even if I did. Did you drive yourself here? No. Well, how will you get to the hospital? I will. Okay. This is it. The trail. - Trail? - It's the trail. - Is it? Yes, yes. Okay. Yes, I see. I see trail. Follow it that way. It'll bring you back to the parking lot. Okay? Yes. Yes. Go. Go. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Okay, go. Go. Hey! Hey! Wait! Forgot something in my jacket. This is not right trail. I think you'll love it. The house is amazing. Exactly. It's very private. Okay. That sounds great. We can meet tomorrow at the seller's residence. Eight o'clock. Perfect. Thanks. Bye. What happened? The tank overflowed. Oh... I have some of those things. What things? Those... hand wipes. - Good. - Here. Thank you. So I have another showing tomorrow. That's great, I heard. It's right by the college. I could drop by after. Tomorrow I'm pretty busy. Well, how 'bout a quick lunch then? I could pick up something on the way over. Yeah, I really don't have time tomorrow. Okay. Never mind. Can you see if my lipstick's in the glove compartment? Sure. Mm-hmm... Mmh... nope. No, it's not in there. What are you doin'? Jesus, Joan. - Did you look good? Well? Is that it? Yeah. I didn't see it. 'Cause you didn't look. You watched me. Forget it. You did the same thing with the baking powder. With the baking powder? Forget it. No, obviously you're not forgetting it. What about the baking powder? It was right there in the pantry. Right in front of your face. - Jesus Christ, Joan. Are we really gonna fight about this, huh? You don't care. I don't care about what? Your mind's always somewhere else. Okay, well what groundbreaking thought kept me from finding your fucking lipstick? Go ahead, mock me. When you're being this ridiculous, you deserve it. You're driving home. Great. Well, it turns out my student-teacher submitted my fantasy football results instead of my paper. And here I was thinking my calculations were wrong. Well, at least that explains why you got rejected. That it does. Are you planning on resubmitting? Hmm, who knows? Maybe. What about you, Arthur? - My article? - Yeah. Um, I think it might have a chance in some smaller journals... Oh, absolutely. It's a fantastic article. Thank you. We'll see. We'll see. Have you read it, Joan? - Hmm? - Have you read it? No. She doesn't read my work. Sorry. - It's okay. - It's okay. I don't... appraise your houses. I just... ...think he should be pursuing other opportunities instead of waiting around trying to get published. Publication in the right journal can do wonders for an adjunct's career. Mm-hmm. So can change of profession. Oh, stop it, Joan. - Stop what? - Please. You think it's right your wife does all the heavy lifting so you can pretend to be an intellectual? Is that right, honey? See, belittling me... ...does wonders for Joan's self-esteem. Now, having an audience compounds that effect, so consider your presence tonight medicinal. Right, dear? Hmm? - Cheers. Cheers to that. Right, Joan? Well, that's good. Ruin my work. We can't keep doing this. Hey. How long have you been here? Two days. Like this? Give me your tie. You'll freeze. - Come on. - Take coat. - I don't want the coat. - Please, take coat. I don't want the coat. I want to find the trail. Come on. Ah. Grab the root. Why are you doing this? Huh? Why do you wanna die? I do not want to die. Then why are you here? It is... I didn't want to live. What's the difference? My company sent me to the document... ...research department... ...after I make a mistake. It was a demotion. A job? That's why you're doing this? You do not get real work. Nobody speaks to you. You are there, but you are not. Without job... ...i cannot take care of my family. So you come here instead... You do not understand my culture. No. No, I don't. What's wrong? Are you okay? Just dizzy. Hello? Is anybody there?! Hello?! Hello! There is no one. Then what was that? Tamashii. What's tamashii? Tamashii are spirits. They are souls wandering these woods until it is their time. Things are not what they seem here. It was probably just an animal. There are very few animals in aokigahara. Well, then it was one of the few. This place is what you call purgatory. Now, why would I call it that? Because you are American. - So? - You believe in god. I'm a scientist. There are answers for this in science? There are answers for everything in science. But not in god? God is more our creation than we are his. So... why end your life? Excuse me? If god is not waiting for you on the other side, who is? Why do you want to die? I'm here sightseeing. For sightseeing? What? I don't know who the hell you are... ...but I stopped to help you. - You did. - Yeah, I did. Hey! I can't... can't move. Get away from me. I don't want your help. 'Cause... 'Cause of a job? Huh? You got a wife and kid to go home to and that's not enough for you. - On three! - No, what are you doing? - One! Two! Three! - No! No! Hi. You okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. I must've dozed off. Is this the jacket i bought you? Yeah. You like it? It's comfortable. You okay? You could've burned the house down, Joan. I said I was sorry. I almost stopped off at the store on the way home. If I had... - Yeah, yeah. The house would be in ashes right now. Okay? Is me telling you how right you are enough to keep this from turning into an argument? It's not the house that I was concerned about. You're home early. Should I feel about that too? It was just an observation, Joan. You see it all, don't you? Yeah. You know what? I do. I see it all. I see you stopped by the bar. I did, right after I sold my second house this week. Well, I'd say we should celebrate, but obviously you already have. I'm a grown woman. You're a clich. I'm a grown woman. That's an alcoholic. Funny how the so-called alcoholic's the one who pays the mortgage. What's your excuse? - For what? Get a job. - I have a job. - A real job. Not one that pays 20 grand a year. I like what I do, Joan. Uh-huh, about as much as you like that jacket. - Like I said, it's-- - comfortable. Yeah, I know. What's wrong with that? - You don't care anymore. - About what? Anything! It's like you've settled on some lesser version of yourself. Why can't you just be happy for me? Because I'm too busy feeling bad for myself. At least you admit it. That I have a husband that continuously puts himself first and I'm such a fool that I keep letting him do it? Fine! Yeah, I admit it. You. You were the one... ...that said I should quit northlab. That was you! - Because you hated it there! No, because you hated me there! Remember? You hated me there! Are you really gonna go down that road? No, I don't. But apparently you do. As usual. You quit three years ago. I figured you'd find something else by now. And I have. Really? Yeah? Please. Don't give me "please." I have. You could be doing a hell of a lot more and you know it. Stop pretending this has anything to do with the job. It has to do with you continuing to take advantage of me. Name one time-- - there's been plenty. - Yeah? 'Cause god forbid you could take care of me for once. What are you talkin' about? - It's what you do. - What? You... you take advantage of people. Yet you can't give me any example of when I have. You can't think of anybody but yourself. If people need you, when I need you, there is always something! There is always something more important to do! Or... ...or someone. I knew it. I knew you couldn't do it. I knew you couldn't do it. Well... You couldn't keep from bringing it up. Could you? - Well, you... ...make it really hard not to sometimes. You couldn't keep from bringing it up. You had me in the crosshairs for three years, baby. - This is how we are. - Let's drink on it. You and me, let's have a toast to the reason that you, miss Joan Brennan, are a drunk. Let's have a toast to me, your philandering, selfish husband. Mmh. I'm done trying to make amends with you. - Well, you shouldn't be! - Well, I am. Are you okay? I'm just tired. Do you need to rest? You need these? Hey, talk to me. What's your name? Takumi. That your whole name? Nakamura takumi. Tell me about your family. My wife... ...kiiro... ...she's so smart... ...charming. We have one daughter, fuyu. Sorry I yelled... ...at you, earlier. Maybe I deserved. No. No, you didn't. Hey... what? What is it? Wh... what now? Water. Water? Yes, this way! Oh! Wait, wait. How do you know it's okay to drink? I do not, but would rather get sick later than die tonight. Good point. Oh... oh. For later. Ah. We should follow it downstream. It is best way to find help. Ah! What's that? Ancient Japanese survival technique? No, no. I learned on discovery channel. Man vs. Wild. Ah. Oh. Mount fuji... ...where is it? We could use it to get our bearings. The parking lot was just... ...just west of the mountain. East. Are you sure? Hey, hey! Where you going? It is said a flower grows when a should has crossed over from this place. There's hardly any soil. Yeah. We should continue. What do we do now? I don't know. It was your idea. What is that? - What? Right there. Someone's there. Hey. Hello? He's German. There are many others like him. They come from many countries. Some are certain of this. Others change mind. Help me take off his clothes. The mri detected a small mass. No. Right now it's pressing against your frontal lobe. If you choose resection, which I highly recommend you do... ...your recovery will not be swift. It's okay. It's okay. We got this. How risky is the surgery? It's a highly invasive procedure. Could I die doing it? - It's possible. - - But unlikely, right? But unlikely? Uh, 24, I got c. 2400 joules. Uh, I couldn't figure out 25. I couldn't figure out any of them. It's b, potential energy. - For 25? - Yeah? Professor? It's velocity, Trey. The question is was the velocity positive or was it negative. Anyone? Simon? We're on 25. We're on 26. The answer's negative. It's negative velocity. Why is it negative velocity? You know why? Take over. Run through the quiz with the rest of the class. Remember that there's still a force if the velocity is zero. Okay... anybody got 27? We didn't even go over this stuff. I know, he just kinda walked out. Excuse me. Sorry, I just need to grab that. Hey, hey, talk to me. About anything. Talk to me. I'm so cold. I know. Me too. Tell me about that song you were singing. - Song? - Yeah, yeah. Down by the water. I don't know. Maybe I make up. Y-y-you kept saying the line... "Rakue... uno... ...Kai-Kai-kaidan..." Rakuen eno kaidan. - Uh-huh? - Hai. It's old song. - Okay. Kaidan means "stairway." "Stairway to paradise." Like "stair-stairway to heaven"? No, no. Different. Much shorter. That's funny. It's... it's from movie. American movies. Gene Kelly. - Uh-huh? Why do you love the song? Why do you love this song? I'm most happy near the water. It is my paradise. The song make me think of good memories there. That's where you should go when you get out of here. You hear me? Hey! That's where you should go. - I like that. - Okay. Will you? I don't know. Gotta find shelter. We can't... stay here. Over here! I'm here! In here! Look at me. Listen to me. Listen to me. We're gonna be okay. I promise you I'm gonna get you out of here. You hear me? Takumi! Ah! No, no, no, no, no. No, no. No, no, no, no. No! No! Ah, come here. It's me. It's me. Breathe, breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Ah. Tent. A tent. Hel-help. Help. We need help. Say-say-say we need help. Say we need help. Hands, hands, hands, hands. You still have time to eat. Doc said 12 hours before cutoff. I don't think I'm hungry. It's all right. I guess I'm gonna have to eat this all by myself, huh? What are you? Afraid. Well you... you should be. Your chair's broken. Yeah, well why not add falling off a chair to the list? I don't wanna die, Arthur. Listen to me. Mm-mmh. You're not gonna die. You're not. It's not-it's not the thought of dying that scares me. It's the thought of dying there, at a hospital. In some... ...cold, empty room surrounded by people who are only there because it's their job to be. I'll see if I can... ...stay in the operating room. I don't think they let people do that. I don't think they do either, but I'll try. Promise me something, Arthur. Promise me that whenever it's your time... ...promise me it won't be in a place like that. Okay. I'm serious. Just promise me it'll be the perfect place. You make it sound like I'm gonna know when that time is. - Yeah, I think you will. I think deep down we all do. Please? Okay. I promise. I promise. You must know by now this forest, it is very powerful. Uh-huh. I know it's very cold. Have you tried his compass? Where are you, compass? Doesn't work. Must be the volcanic rock. The high iron deposits are throwing it off. There's more than that. You make it sound like this forest is keeping us here. It seems to have a reason. Just as it did for bringing us here. Okay, so why do you think he brought all his things? As I said before... ...some people are sure when they come, others are not. You think he was unsure? And then I think he got lost. That happens often, too. The ribbons. Ribbons? Yeah, the ribbons. There was the-the strings... ...tied up between the trees. I saw them on the way in. They help people find their way back, like... ...bread crumbs. I wonder if one of those ribbons were his. I wonder if any are yours. I used actual bread crumbs. You are handsome. Pardon? You used bread crumbs. Handsome and gretel. What? Hansel and gretel. Had me worried there for a second. The sky is darker. I thought just the opposite. Is it morning yet? It's ten after three. What? Does she know you are here? Who? Who you talkin' about? She's why you are here. What is your name? Arthur. What was her name? Joan. Joan... When did she-- - two weeks ago. You must have had... Very nice marriage with her. No. Was it always bad? No. No, we had a lot of really great years. A lot of 'em. What changed? We did. She was an alcoholic. A functioning alcoholic, which supposedly made it... ...okay, but she was... ...she was horrible to me sometimes. I was even worse to her. A few years ago i had an affair... ...with a coworker from a research lab, but i-i didn't tell her. She found out on her own. Which-which... Which made it worse, i think. Things went downhill from there. She-she... She started drinking more. The more she despised me, the more she... ...hated herself. I gave her a reason to drink. I was her excuse to drink. We almost got divorced... Twice. She never trusted me again. I can't blame her 'cause I didn't let her. Did you love her? No, it... ...it was just a meaningless fling. I meant your wife. More than anything on earth. So... why do that to her? I... I don't know. I just did. I mean... It wasn't something i thought about. I just did it. Sometimes you do things. As much as you'd wanna take 'em back... ...you can't. After that... ...we pretty much started keeping our feelings for each other... ...a secret. Like, I would fix things for her, but... ...you know, only in the middle of the night when she was asleep, or when... ...she was out. Like, I'd buy her a box of tea... ...a new one... ...and I'd wait until... ...the old package wasn't too full or too empty before refilling it. That way she wouldn't know... And that way she wouldn't have to... ...choose whether or not to thank me. Hmm. Then she, uh... I found my shirts... ...cleaned and pressed in the back of my closet, only i-i-i hadn't washed 'em. She purposefully put 'em way in the back so, by the time that I got to 'em... ...I'd forget they were dirty in the first place and I wouldn't have to choose whether or not... ...to tell her i appreciated her. This little game we had. No consequences. No "thank yous." It was a game, but it was all we had. Then she got sick... ...and all the anger, and the pretending, and the fighting, it all-it all... ...it all got put on hold. It's always that moment. You know? Life-changing moment that... ...knocks us on the floor and reminds us what really matters. The thing about those moments is they come and they go and sometimes they... ...they come too late. Too late. I didn't come here because of the loss. I didn't come here because of the grief. I came here bec- because of the guilt. I was wrong to treat my wife the way I treated her and she was wrong to treat me how she did. Now neither one of us are ever gonna get the chance to say... ...I'm sorry. She's listening. No she's not. It is during our darkest times that our loved ones are closest. Even those who have passed. Her spirit... No, it's not. She's with you. This forest holds her for you. It is true. I'm sorry. Please... No, I'm sorry. I'm sor-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know if I can live without her. You do not have to... ...forever. Been on vacation? No. Well, your box has been full all week. I haven't emptied it yet. Right, right. That's what I'm sayin'. Anyway. Help. Help. Is anybody there? Please. We need help. Takumi. Get up, takumi. Hey, wake up. Wake up. There's no fire. No more fire. No more fire. We have to go. Up. Up. Hey, come on. Come on. We have to go. I can't carry you. Can you walk? You should go. Hey, okay, listen. I'm coming back. Okay? I'm gonna-- I'm gonna get help. I swear I'm coming back to get you. Okay? Okay? Thank you... ...for taking care of me. Hey, hey. I'll be back. I'll be back. Lay down. I'll be back. I promise. Okay? I promise. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. Hello. Hello. Hello. Are you there? We need help. Please, send an ambulance. Shit. Yeah? Huh. Oh, remember this hat? - Where is that? - I have no idea. What was this? Like '90... '98? '99? Oh. Yeah, it must've been, 'cause there's the old north lab logo, and they changed it at the turn of the millennium. Sorry. It's okay. Stop. Uh, okay, there we are at the lake house. I loved that lake. Just being near the water. It's my paradise. You know what your favorite thing to do was? At least from my eye, you used to love to go down there and walk. Those orchids. You'd be down there for hours, then you'd walk back up the stairs and you'd line 'em up right across that windowsill. You remember that. Of course I do. We can go back there whenever you want to. Okay. Hey... You made it past the first step, okay? You already crossed the first hurled and that's... ...that's a good sign. I'm just nervous. I don't know. I've been so angry. So many things. Listen. Let's both get one of those hats. Both of us. Okay? What if I want a frilly hat? Well then, I guess I'm gonna have to wear a frilly hat. You can't wear a-- I can pull off a frilly hat. You don't think i could pull off a frilly hat? - You'll look like a girl. - I don't care. I can handle frilly and feathers. Go for it. Hey. - Hey. We finally received the results from the tests, and... ...the mass was non-malignant. How are you feeling? Um, after that i feel pretty great. You dealing with the pain okay? Yeah, it's... ...just a little sore here. It's gonna sting a little. So... ...the plan is still to transport you over to the recovery unit at St. Mary's. Thank you. Listen, okay? Listen. Have this on you. I'll call you on the way so you have some company, okay? It's okay if she has the phone in there, right? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. You got the car? Right behind you, baby. Okay. Call me. I hope to even text you inappropriate photos while I'm driving tonight! Tonight! You're crazy. Cheeseburger, Margarita, little dancing. Are you there? Mm-hmm. - Hi. - Are you cozy? Are you cozy up there? - Yeah. - I am right behind you, baby. - I can see you. - You can see me? Through those dark tinted windows? Yeah, I can see a little bit. Oh, wave. Can you wave? You can't see me, I'm sure. No, I don't. I don't see you. My god, it's weird. It's bumpy in here. You've never ridden in the back of an ambulance before? No, actually. Not even as a kid? No, never. Why is that so hard to believe? It's not hard to believe that you've never been in the back of an ambulance before. It's just hard to believe that I had no idea... ...that you've never been in the back of an ambulance before. Well, I'm sure there's things about you I don't know. You know, I somehow doubt that. Okay. What's your favorite color? Oh, now you're messing with me. Like you don't know my favorite color? Huh? What's mine? Your favorite color is... ...um... You got me. Hi, my name is Arthur. Um, nice to meet you. Who is this beautiful person-- Joan! Joan! Joan! I hear you. I hear you. I read you. I'm here. Stairway, stairway, s... Stairway... Stairway, stairway... Rakuen kaidan... K-kaidan... Kaidan. Hey... Ha... Sir? Sir? Are you okay, sir? Yeh... yeh... yeh... You have to get him. He... he... he's still in there. He... he's still in there. He's still in there. He... He's still in there. Mr. Brennan? Sir? We're locking up for the evening. I'm sorry. Can I get another minute? Of course. It was very well attended. She obviously was very loved. I didn't know her. I'm sorry? My wife. I didn't really know her. I mean, i-i-i knew... ...you know, the date her car insurance needed to be renewed... ...and her social security number... Thing-things that seemed important. I didn't know her favorite... ...her favorite color. I don't know her favorite season. I don't know her favorite book. It was a children's story. I overheard her sisters talking about it earlier. Apparently one of them ordered it for her recently. No mention of a favorite color or season, though. I'm sorry. Take your time, sir. We do play baseball, you know. Yes. This is more entertaining. If you say so. Let me take a look. It's healing nicely. How are you feeling? Better. Better is good. Better is very good. Glasses. Look at my finger. It's bright. It's a light shining right in your eyeball. It should be. Good. Don't tell me you're playing along. No, this is s- this is something else. Channel five. It's the seventh inning. Why did you go to aokigahara? It wasn't working. What wasn't? Moving on. Do you still want to end your life? No. What do you plan to do after you leave the hospital? Go back to the forest. I made a promise to someone and I'm going to keep it. You are speaking of the other person who was with you? I have to find him. As I understand it, the park rangers already tried. It's a... it's a big forest. Trust me. There's a video camera in the parking lot. I know. I saw it. And it saw you on the day you entered the forest. The rangers reviewed the footage from the day you say he entered. No one entered aokigahara that day. Look. I was there with someone. I mean, I don't know... ...which particular way he entered the forest. I don't know what particular day he got there. I do know that when I left him he was dying. The fact remains, without any visual confirmation we have no way of identifying him, and therefore, no way of notifying his family. His name was takumi Nakamura. There are thousands with that name. He had a family. He had a wife named kiiro, and a... ...and a child named fuyu. Mr. Brennan, there are not... I'm telling you, all right, he's in there somewhere. I don't doubt that. You said the rangers scouted the forest? Did they find a tent? I left him by a tent. It's been two weeks. - It's been 12 days. - Still... Answer my question. Did they find a tent? There was no sign of the person you described. Takumi! Things are not as they seem here. This forest is what you call purgatory. No one entered the forest that day. It is during our darkest times that our loved ones are closest. Even those who have passed. Promise me. Promise me you'll find the perfect place. It is said a flower grows when a soul has crossed over from this place. Did you love her? More than anything on earth. She is with you. This forest holds her for you. Thank you for taking care of me. I don't know how to live without her. You will not have to. Not forever. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Would you like breakfast? Yes, please. Cereal or omelette? Um... omelette. Yes, sir. Arigato. How can I help you? I just didn't understand this section on, uh, on... ...column's law. It's coulomb's law. It's a good one. Yeah, I didn't think any of 'em were good. No, this one is. Trust me. Coulomb's law is based on electrostatic forces, all right, some of the most important thing in all of the universe, because... They keep us together. Now the question here is with electrostatic forces of attraction and repulsion. They are directly proportional to what? Yellow winter. Yellow winter? Yeah. Right here... ...on this little slip of paper. You wrote that, right? - This? - Yeah. Kiiro. Fuyu. Yellow and winter. You speak Japanese? Yeah, I do. Me and my dad were stationed in okinawa. I went to elementary school there. These are not names? No. No, not really, they're... ...a color and a season. Professor? It-it's directly proportional to the electrical charges, and it's... ...inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
