But it has recorded some policemen were beating a man. He is not a nice guy for sure. But it is clear that the suspect was under control at that time. According to the law, it can be labeled as an illegal assault and battery. The superior has decided to start the investigation. Although, this video has not spread out yet. But there is still the risk. The vice commissioner hoped that we can finish the investigation as soon as possible. So we can avoid all the troubles afterwards. The question is no one has reported on chasing suspects on that day. And the man has not yet met with Complaint Department... to complain about this incident. That means you are going to find that man who was beaten. And we are going to give you those colleagues. That's right. When we have found all the evidence, we'll see if anyone had got out of line. Where did it happen? lt happened in the alley of... lt's my West Kowloon area. What about the time then? lt was 23th August, 2006 at two a.m.. -Good afternoon Sir. -Good afternoon.

They fight around and be impolite to police. Go and check their license. -Any Question ? -No Sir. Start off at ten minutes later. Once the investigation is completed, the colleagues involved will definitely be dismissed. CAPO is still looking for the evidence and they don't have much progress yet.

What can l do? l have read through Eight's report. He has great records. So what? He was willing to declare it. Since he thought that we police force could help him. He is too optimistic. lf you are worrying that he can't take it, just refer him to the counselor. -But... -Give him the letter first. Maybe he can take it. We can't settle all by ourselves. How about the beating case? Did the three guys say anything? Right now we still can't proof that it was them. l don't care. What l need is get it done. Hey, is Big B's information for real?

We have result already. -What's wrong? -The lock is broke. What is the noise? Who is it? Eight, what the hell are you doing? Handle it yourself. What are you doing? l want to know what had happened. The lock is broken, Sir! You seem can't control your own feelings! lf you have any questions, you should talk to me directly. -Dak, find someone to fix the door! -Yes Sir. Give me a report afterwards. Yes Sir. Sam, wait a minute. Sorry, Sir! l apologize for what just happened. What do you want to say? ls it possible that you can ask the superior... -...not to put me to the civilian post? -No. lt's you who encouraged me to do the declaration. There's many thing l can't be in charge. l am not borrowing from loan sharks. Just one of the victims of negative equity. Why don't you help me? Nobody cares if your debt is reasonable or not. lf l were failed in rescheduling debts, l would totally willing to. But you don't even give me a chance. lf you think l can't help you, you could come to Chan Sir directly. You mean it's not your responsibility then. lt's enough. lt is only a temporary policy. Doesn't mean that the Welfare Department will not lend you money. My case has not reached the tribunal panel. But you had already put me out of the way. They will not lend me money, of course.

We have followed those PTU back to the base. l think they will off duty soon. Should we continue to trail? They can't do anything at this moment. -Look for Chan Kam Shing first. -Roger. -Move to Jordan. -Yes Sir. Split off. Not in the briefing room. Restaurant either. They said they didn't see him. Let's continue. Sam... l arrested him at Bill's place. But l had reported to the station. Chung is showing him to the small room. But Serious Violence and Crime Unit will come in fifteen minutes. Bus Captain had told me Eight's case already. How is he now? We haven't found him yet. l will pay attention to that. Move to the small room first. Thank you. Move to the rooftop. Seven, Eight is temporality on holiday starting from tomorrow. -Take off? -Just follow what l said. Ask him to see me. l'll be back soon. Yes Sir. Suen, move to the east wing. Nothing. What should we do, Bro Sam? Let's inform our vice captain. We have to deal with Shing. Eight is wandering around with his gun. How can we ignore that? -Look for Eight. -Let's go. -Chan Sir! -With regard to Eight... About Eight's ... Captain informed me already. lt's surprise me that you convinced them to let him stay. Sorry Sir. lt's alright. We need to be opened up. But you've seen how Eight behaved in the toilet today. How can l let him on duty with a gun? l'm going to let him taking day off from tomorrow. Afterwards you can talk with Captain in the meeting. Even if we can't change the decision of Eight's shifting, the Welfare Department might have approved his rescheduling already. The situation will be really different then. We had over a hundred policemen who were deeply in debt last year. They all need support. How many of them you can help? l will have a meeting in the headquarter. CAPO has checked the guy is called Shing. lf it proofs that it was done by these three guy, l will definitely remove them. lf we dealt with him first, all would be fine. Wong Sir. What's the matter? May has just arrested a guy. The suspect is sending to the Serious Violence and Crime Unit. -lsn't it that wanted person Shing? -Yes. We will off duty in thirty minutes. We can talk about it in the briefing room then. Yes Sir. Tong, l'm Sam. Shing has gone to your place. Can l talk to him for a few minutes? No problem. But he is not here yet. l'll call you then. -How is that? -Wait for Tong's call. Damn it! He said we can call him if we need help. We still have chances about the beating case. We'd better look for Eight first. We have to return the gun in thirty minutes. What if we inform the vice captain. We don't know if he is going to kill or suicide. lf we were not chasing for Shing, Eight would not turn out like that. lf we could find him return the gun, we could solve other problems. Tong, l'm Wong Chung Ching. Do me a favor. lt's easy. Just let me meet that guy. l would do everything for Wong Sir. But my boss is here. l will deal with him first and call you later. Cheung, l have to see a doc. You take in charge. lt's okay. Boss, where are you going? We take over this guy. Let's go. Chan Kam Shing, 43 years old, right? -lsn't it? -Yes. -Where do you live? -Mong Kok. Which part of Mong Kok? Rm D, 3 Boss, he is Shing. His name is Shing. He is in connection with the bodily harm of the Nightclub keeper, whose name is Big B. EU saw him on the crime scene but he ran away. Did you find any witness?

Wong Sir, we can't find Eight still. -Where is he? -l don't know. But he was strange. When we were in the DO room, he took his gun out and just wiped it there. armory just said he hasn't returned the gun yet. -May. -lt is done, right? l just brought Shing to the Serious Violence and Crime Unit. But Bro Sam didn't come to talk with him. They were going to the small room. How come they haven't talked? l don't know. l saw them when l returned the suspect. We saw Eight at the rooftop when we're on the way. But we can't find him when we went up there. So we just split up and seach now. l got it. lf we find him, we'll call you. Thanks. -May, have you seen Eight? -No. Eight was shifted. This was supposed to be his last duty. l am not clear about his situation. We have to find him out. Let's split up our search. We'll see in the armory. Yes Sir. Bro Sam. We have to hand in our guns. We have got a case already. lf we don't return the gun on time, things would get more trouble. We have done our part already. We even gave up Shing for him. lf we don't return our gun, we would be another Eight. Why did you attack Big B? Dispute over places? Damn it! l don't even know who is Big B. You don't know? You are from the same industry. Why don't you ask Big B to recognize me? l need to crap. Just leave it. l'll let you go soon. Big B's men are waiting for you at the front door right now. Are you bluffing? What do you want? l need to crap. -Do you have enough? -l need to crap. What are you doing? Sit down! Bastard, you'll get into trouble if you can't make it.

He is related to one of our cases. Keep him there for us. We need his statement. How? He is related to a serious crime too. We have our job either. l can't make a decision. Can you come over and talk to my boss directly? Damn it! Move to West Kowloon! Sam, have you met Eight? No. He hasn't returned the gun and we couldn't find him. He didn't answer his phone. Wong Sir, nothing. Wong Sir had convinced the Captain changed his shifting... to off duty. He doesn't know this yet and he is still holding the gun. We worry that he would lose his mind. Five minutes left. lf he doesn't return the gun on time, he would be wanted. Just wait a minute. Hope that he would come and move no more wrong steps. Stand still. Talk to me finally, huh! l thought you didn't recognize me. You didn't listen my call for a whole day. -What do you want? -Solve this for me. How can l? l am a policeman. The only thing does matter is the knife. Help me to wipe out the fingerprint. l will deal with Big B then. Just give him a few hundred thousands is fine. l'll find a lawyer to deal with it. l can't bear the risk to do it. You don't do this for me. Do this for your debt. You owe us nearly six hundred thousand. Where is the interest of this week then? l borrowed from your boss, not you. But l know! l might be in jail for two years.

You want to fix Wong Sir. ln fact, he has convinced the Captain already. You don't have to shift anymore. He has solved all the problems for you. Why can't you wait a bit more. Things are getting worse now. Are you gonna push yourself to the dead end. Bro Sam, it is Shing! Police! Come out! Come out! What's wrong, Sam? What's wrong? Sam, answer me. Shing is in the rooftop. He is shooting at us. Sergeant, bring your men to the rooftop and guard Exit B. l am going to guard Exit A with my column. The rest guard on the ground floor. Upstairs! Shing. You are not going anywhere. Put down your gun and surrender now! Sam, at you 12:00 position. Seven, stay at this exit. Go! Sam, we are at Exit A of the rooftop, where are you? Eight.

We succeed to stop the defendant in the pedestrian which is opposite to... l saw the mouth of the victim was bleeding. After investigation, we've found that this was done by the defendant. -Do you get used to it? -No. But it is much better than typing in front of a computer. lt is difficult to predict. That shot supposed to be fired at either Wong Sir or myself. But at last it was fired at the criminal. And what l did is legal. The most important thing is... you have stopped me getting wrong. As long as you are okay now. Wong Sir helped me wholeheartedly. He didn't tell anyone about l wanted to kill him. He knew that you had lost your mind at that time. But l had really done that. After serving five years civilian post, l can pay back all the debts to the Welfare Department. But l wonder if l have the confident to pick up my gun then. l can't face myself. Just leave it to that. Don't bother about the early retirement. You said you always know... what you are doing. How about your beating case? Shing is dead. CAPO has closed the file. Hey, my son has graduated. He is a Probationary lnspector now. He will service into West Kowloon. lf he becomes my boss, ask him to take care of me. Of course. So that you'll never beat any suspects again. Stand still. Don't try to fix me with false evidence. l'm going to sue you. Shut up. We can see those faces clearly. lt is the three men from Bravo Three. -Go away, bastard. -l can run many times. Why don't you chase hawkers since you are such a runner. He is so bluffing. How did you get the movie? A bar girl recorded this in the alley with her mobile phone . She planned to put it on web. But her boyfriend took it to us. Her boyfriend is my colleague. ls he trying to make a issue? He didn't hand it to the CAPO so he might just want to help. What for? We should remove them from office. Wong, Although they have gone across the line, we have to consider the pressure of our frontline forces. lf you were the one who got insult like that on the street, You would even shut down Yau Tsim Mong for a whole week. You handle this then. CAPO has closed the file already. What if we give them a chance? l suggest that we delete this video, does everyone agree? Do what is needed in the right time. l will check on you whenever l see you. l don't think that... ...you can get away next time.
