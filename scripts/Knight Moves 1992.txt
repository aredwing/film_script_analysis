I just want to keep him overnight, and then start sessions with a child psychologist. I knew this would happen. His mother's not strict enough with him. She lies in bed drunk all day and the boy does whatever he wants. After he's released it's crucial that he's supervised. The most important thing is that during his treatment he's not allowed anywhere near a chessboard. I've got a drunk for a wife and a lunatic for a son. I don't need this shit anymore! You're crazy! Both of you! Help me. Today concludes the second week of competition in this round-robin candidates tournament. Each of the players will play the other a minimum of three times and the winner will earn the right to play for the world title next year. But the big story is the amazing comeback of Peter Sanderson who is currently leading the tournament. The European Grand Master, now residing in Westport, Connecticut, stunned the chess world three years ago when he walked out in the middle of last candidates tournament while leading by three games and he forfeited the match to Viktor Yurilivich who is only two games behind Sanderson in this match. - Congratulations, Mr. Sanderson. - Thank you, Miss Rutlege. - Your schedule for tomorrow. - Daddy! Hey! - Congratulations, Dad! - Thank you, darling... my cheering section. You're playing the English. Lutz won't do that. - He opened his first game with it. - He knows that you're aware of it. Then I'll transpose. On a variation, yes, but it must be a variation that is unique. - I'm sure you have something. - Of course. Get rid of Knight. Bishop takes Bishop. Pawn for Pawn. Now Rook threatens Queen. That's to your advantage. With the excellent range of your Bishops, he's finished. It's a good play, but risky. You don't win by playing it safe, Peter. - Daddy. - Hey! What are you doing up? I can't sleep. My bed's lumpy. Forgot to bring your night light, didn't you? That has nothing to do with it. - You want to sleep in my bed tonight? - Okay! I'll tuck you in. Jeremy, have someone pick up a night light tomorrow. Sure. - Hello? - Debi? - Yes? - It's me. I forgot something. Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, Frank, but we got a real nut on our hands. Run it. Debi Rutlege, female, Caucasian, twenty-four. Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel. A neighbor found her. Local? No. She just moved here... four months ago from Portland. What the hell is going on here? Gentlemen this is not a party. Anybody who doesn't have to be in here get the hell out. - Yes, sir. - Now! Oh, I came out here from the city to get away from this... What have you got, Nolan? There's no sign of break-in. I think she let him in. - How long has she been dead? - Six, eight hours tops. What's the cause of death? You think whoever did this wanted it to look like suicide? He would have taken more care not to the leave rope burns on her wrists. No, the way I got it figured is, he tied her up, slit her wrists, then sat back and watched her bleed to death. But that's not the main thing. What's wrong with this picture? There's no blood. Where the hell's the blood? Bingo. - Did Miss Rutlege have a boyfriend? - I guess so. - What do you mean, you guess so? - I know she had company last night. - A man. - How do you know that? Well, her bedroom is on the other side of mine. The walls are very thin. I could hear them. So what are you trying to tell us Ma'am? They were, uh, humping? They were having sex, yes. It wasn't that I was intentionally listening, - but with the walls being so thin... - That's all right. Thank you very much, we appreciate it. Well... First thing I'd like to say is that some of us have not had the opportunity to get to know each other since I took over from Captain Waters last month. And a lot of you feel that I'm an outsider who came over and took over a job that should have gone to a local, but that's the way it worked out. You can bitch and complain all you want but you will tow the line in my department. Which means that the next time an officer responds to a homicide call he seals off the scene of the crime and nobody gets in but but Detective Wagner and myself. Is that clear? Also, I don't want to hear anybody talking about this message on the wall or the blood. Nothing. - Anything? - Not much. I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region. - What about sperm? - No trace. - Prints? - No prints. - No prints but hers. - No, Frank. No prints. - Yes? - Mr. Sanderson? Frank Sedman, Roxbridge P.D. Detective Wagner. I don't know whether or not you've heard about... Oh, Miss Rutlege. Yes, I did. - May we come in? - Oh, sure. - I hope we are not interfering. - No. - Morning. - Good morning. - Can we talk in private? - I'll get out of your way, gentlemen. - Nice to have met you. - Nice to meet you too, sir. I see you're busy so I'll get right to it. How well did you know Debi Rutlege? Only in passing. To say hello to. What does that mean? I don't understand that. I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly? Well, chess tournaments can be boring. People have a lot of free time. - They like to gossip. - What did you do last night? I played Gregory Lutz. Ah, yes, you won two games, you left the auditorium at eight forty five. What did you do after that? I came back to my room and I went for a walk. - By yourself? - Of course. Of course. Well I have here a printout from the hotel computer that logs all the calls to your room. I noticed one here at 9:04. "From Debi. Please call me at home." She was calling to give me my schedule for tomorrow. Ah, I see. Funny thing here is that you say you only knew her in passing. But this message says please call me at home and there's no number. Which would indicate that you already know her number. - I got it from the tournament directory. - There's no Debi Rutlege in the directory. That's because you're looking in the general directory. In the player's directory everyone connected to the tournament is listed. - We seem to have a little problem here? - Oh, really? What kind of problem? I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem. - What are you saying? - We're not saying anything. We're just trying to put a few pieces together, that's all. Thank you. Well what do you think? He's got an answer for everything, but no alibi. You think he's dirty? I don't know, but you're right about one thing. He's lying. I'd like a different chair. This one killed me yesterday. Also, the pieces on the board move too slowly. It's distracting. Will they be sped up? Grandmaster Sanderson, there are five other players. Now, if we were to accede to every special request... I'm not asking anything special. I just want to be able to concentrate. David? No problem. It's a matter of adjusting the response time. Can you make it so they don't slide across the board? Well if I do that, the audience is going to have a difficult time following the move. - Well can you speed them up then? - Okay. Yeah, that looks pretty good. You're acting like a superstitious schoolboy, Peter. What's next? Incense and rosary beads? Grandmaster Lutz, you'll be sitting here for your next match. Oh no... no, I can't sit there. I must be facing north. My power comes from the north. - Hello, Peter. - Hi, Viktor. You played an interesting game last night. Even though sacrificing your Rook at E4 was the game I played against Valsney in '82. - I'm glad it helped you. - You are two points behind. - Doesn't that make you nervous? - I never get nervous. - Besides, you will falter. - Not this time. Well, then this time you will have to stay until the end of the match, won't you? I'll be here. - Are you sure? - Yes. What are you going to do? - Who told you that? - Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world. Has he reached any? No, but he did contact a dead Parcheesi champion. - Mister Sanderson? - Yes. - The phone's for you. - Oh, thank you. Hello... hello? - Hello, Peter. - Who is this? Someone who's going to become an important part of your life. I want to play a game with you. - Well, listen, I don't have time for this. - You had time for Debi. - What? - Don't worry, I wiped off all your prints. What is it, dad? Nothing. Let's go. Mister Sanderson, there's a message for you. - See you later, Dad. - Bye. Thank you. Get me the police. Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier? I don't know. I was afraid of hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game. We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games. - What was your relationship with her? - Casual. - Casual? You were boning her weren't you? - It wasn't serious. What's your problem? - You are! I don't like you. - Fine, don't ask me out on a date. Don't worry I won't. I've seen how your dates end up. Knock it off! Both of you. - This is just a little too convenient. - What's that supposed to mean? It means, if I were the killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try to throw them off the scent too. - That's crazy! Why would I do that? - You like to play games, don't you? Hey listen, he says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why don't you come back and listen for yourself? Don't worry, we'll be back. You can bet on it, pal. You must understand this is not my field. It's not mine either but I can tell this guy's crazy. That's your business right, doc? You deal with crazy people. I deal with people with problems. There are all different types of problems. Look, we don't have the budget for outside psychological help, Dr. Fulton. - We'll take what we can get. - He's acting out some kind of fantasy. We're talking about a deeply disturbed person. No shit! Can a person this disturbed give the appearance of being normal, Dr. Fulton? Absolutely. All right. We've got a suspect but no hard evidence. - If you met him could you tell? - Tell what? - If he's crazy. - If he's... disturbed. Perhaps, but not necessarily. One opinion I can offer with any degree of certainty: He'll kill again. - Oh. Sorry, I thought it was empty. - It's okay. Are you with the tournament? - Are you one of the players? - Yes I am. I always wanted to learn how to play chess. It seems like such a complicated game. Well, not really. You see your goal and you go after it. Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed. Sounds very violent. Chess is a reflection of life. Life is violent. - The strong win. The weak perish. - You enjoy being the stronger one? If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion? That's a very personal question. I see. This is going to be a very polite conversation. I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess. - It is. - Do you always open quickly? - Are we talking about me, or chess? - You. It depends on the opponent. Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian. Well, I think I've had enough. Getting too hot in here for you? - Who are you? A reporter? A cop? - I just came in for a steam. And how far exactly were you willing to go? - Well? - Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes. - You didn't get any vibes from the guy? - I'm a psychologist, not a psychic. - What's this all about anyway? - What did Dr. Fulton tell you? That you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson about some case you're working on. - What'd he do? - We're not sure. What do you think he did? He could be a suspect in a murder investigation. The girl that was killed last night? You send me into a dangerous situation and didn't even warn me? They came to me and asked me for help. Now, what am I supposed to do? You could have been honest with me for starters. We work together. I have to be able to trust you. Hey! Sanderson wasn't going to talk to him. Besides, you're young, attractive... The guy could be a psychopath. It worked out all right, didn't it? Fuck you! Yes! - I won. - Congratulations. It's 11:06. Hello, Kathy. Thanks for coming. Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard. Psychologist helping us out. We've already met, haven't we, Doctor? I see you're still having problems with your openings. Keep him on the line as long as you can. No confrontations. - Hello. - Hello, Peter. Just a second. Hello? Very amateurish, Peter. I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic. I am not an idiot! Don't treat me as one! I'll call you every day. You get one minute. Whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you! Are you ready to play? Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege? To get your attention. What about the word "REMEMBER" on the wall? That's something you're going to have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions. Why not? You don't want to think. That's why I'll win! - I'm already two points ahead. - What? I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play. - Where is she? - You'll find her. If you want to tell me something, just come out and say it! Where is she you son of a bitch! Detective Wagner. I'm sorry but you're going to have to get off the phone line and go back to your tracing equipment. If I wanted to play this game with a moron I would have called you. Hello. I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter? But you're not going to tell me that. "Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town. Upstairs, downstairs in his nightgown. Crawling through a window. At the end of Miss Emma's street. Her God has gone and left his home. So her and I can meet." What the hell you doing grabbing the phone? Sorry. - Anything? - Nothing. We'd have a better chance if we tapped into the main junction box. Thanks, Mr. Sanderson, Kathy. You want me to come with you? Maybe I can help. No. We'll take it from here. You should have been an actor, Frank. You looked like you were really mad. The veins popping out of your neck? Nice touch! You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone? No. I wanted him to. I wanted to find out if there was someone on the other end. But we heard him. It could have been a tape. A prerecorded conversation with himself. The F.B.I. has nothing even remotely similar to this guy. I think he's a first-timer, Frank. Call the State. If he hasn't killed outside of Washington, the F.B.I. wouldn't have him. - Nolan? - He tapes their mouths shut. We found traces of adhesive around the victims' mouths. We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store. - OK, we'll check it out. - Now, the lipstick he uses is interesting. Why is that? Because the company that made it went out of business 16 years ago. - What about the blood? - Not a drop. - Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross. - Kathy? The fact that he's viewing this as a game suggests to me he's trying to prove some sense of superiority. And the way he's killing shows a need to be in complete control of his victims. What about how he arranged the body? That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy. Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions for a long time before they live them out. Once it becomes a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and usually repeat the act to sustain that feeling. But I've got to tell you, in all the research I've ever read on serial killers, I've never heard of one moving this fast. It's as though the game is the catalyst for the murders, not the other way around. Anything else? Yes. Why disguise your voice if no one knows it? That's what I was thinking. I mean he's got to be local. Why would he call Sanderson? He's one of the best chess players in the world. Who better to play a game with? - You still having a problem with that? - Yeah, I am. I don't know, I got a feeling about this guy. It's like he was laughing at us. I'm telling you, he's playing us, Frank. I think we should bring Sanderson in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him. - No way. - Captain, we found her. They're trying to control my thoughts. Aluminum foil. It repels the thought rays. Very nice. - They couldn't break the riddle. - Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it at your feet? We need your help. Well, I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down. But you're the key. You're the one he wants to play the game with. I can't right now. I've got a game. There's a young woman who could be dead by the end of this game. - She could be dead now. - What if she isn't? I don't believe this. Where are your priorities? You have to think between a chess game and someone's life? The girl that was killed last night was twenty one years old! He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage! Gentlemen? Excuse me. - Same as the others? - Yeah. Backspace. There you go. Keep it going up. Keep it going up. - Morning. - Good morning. Daddy! - Got a problem? - Our computer's bust again. - Is it bad? - No, it's all fixed. I also put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind. Of course not. I'm going to play with them. Just kidding. Well listen, I have to get over to Lutz' room now. He thinks someone's tampered with his computer and it's emitting gamma rays to control his thoughts. I'll see you guys later. Don't you have something you want to say to David? - David. - Yeah? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You ready? - For what? Well, you told me you'd take me over to Seattle today. I'm sorry, baby, I can't. Not today. But you promised. Baby, I'm sorry. Peter? - Not now please. - Yes, now! Don't do to Erica what you did to your wife. - Don't bring her into this. - Why not? It's true isn't it? I watched you push her away from you. I sat back. I said nothing. But not this time. This time I'm going to say what I have to say. You have to coach my chess game, not my life! You raise your voice to me? You? You think you can speak to me like this just because you won a few titles?! I'm sorry. Peter, you're like a son to me. It hurts to see you missing so much of your life. This is where he forced his way in. We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope. Andy, hit the lights please. It's a man's shoe. Pretty old by the individual characteristics. About a size 9, maybe 10. - What's this? - Don't know. Looks like a cut or a gash in the sole of the shoe. I think Fulton was right. This guy's not going to stop. He's got a taste for it. Now make sure that Brooks has everything set up for the next call. - No excuses this time. - All right. Just do what I told you to do. I'll call you back later. - Frank, good morning. - Good morning, Mayor. I was in the neighborhood so I though I'd drop by. How nice. - I heard there was another one, Frank. - Yes. - Any new developments? - No, nothing yet. People are scared, Frank. I know that. You know that 70% of the economy of this island is generated through tourism. This weekend the ferry tolls were down by 30%. The hotel vacancy rates were 20% below normal. People aren't coming over here any more, Frank. We have got a major problem on our hands. One that could seriously jeopardize the financial stability of this community. Now, I understand you have a prime suspect in Peter Sanderson. Who told you that? Let's just say that I have friends in this community. A lot of concerned friends who whisper a thing or two in my ear from time to time. What about Sanderson? He's a suspect that's all. If he is involved, he's not acting alone. I don't have enough evidence to do anything. Let me make myself clear. Right now I am not interested in proof. I'm not interested in evidence, I'm not even interested in a conviction. What I am interested in is an arrest. An arrest that would get the press off my ass. And that the tourists with their wallets start coming back over here. Are you saying you want me to arrest Sanderson without sufficient evidence? What I am saying is that I am the mayor of this community because the people have confidence in me. If that confidence falls, I will not be re-elected. And I need hardly remind you that your job is an appointed position by the holder of this office. I don't know, I've been a cop over 20 years now, and I have yet to figure out who is worse: the criminals who break the law or the assholes who make them. I'm chief of police here, and as long as I am, I'll arrest people on the basis of evidence and not political ramifications. I could have your badge for that sentiment. And I could run over to the press and tell them, how you're willing to do away with due processing to sell a few more goddamned shrimp cocktails in your wharf. Have a nice day. One more thing, mayor. I don't like threats. I have dealt with politicians and boys in the back room who are a damned sight tougher than you. And when this thing is solved, you can give your speeches and have your photograph taken. But in the meantime let me do my job. - Morning. - They found the third girl. Her name was Loraine Olsen. I just came from there. God, it was horrible. How can anyone do something like this? - Do you have anything to drink? - Of course. Sit down. Thank you. Hey, hey, hey, relax. How the hell can I relax after what I've just seen. - I know it was bad. - How could you know unless you were there. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. - I'm sure you didn't. - You know, Andy thinks you're doing this. - Doesn't that scare you? - No. - Why? - Because I think he's wrong. Morning. Ready to go? I should brought my fucking fishing pole! It's from the rain. The foundation leaks. - How's it going here? - We're all set. From down here, all calls coming into Mr. Sanderson's room will be re-routed into extension 611. Hello? Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight. You know her? - Not really. - Why her? - Because she's the type. - But you said you didn't know her. I know what I said! She looks just like... Just like who? I really wish you would stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting. - What the hell is that? - It's the water pumps, sir. - I'm just trying to play the game. - You're not playing very well. There are clues all around you and you keep missing them. Listen, if you're just going to call up to gloat, I don't want to hear it! People will be very interested in what I have to say. - Then call them! - Are you crazy? Let's see how much he wants to play. Just for that no hint today. Why are you doing this? You must have an idea of the pain you're causing people. Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have. And you want these girls to feel your pain? Please. I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. - It would detract from the game. - How? I couldn't say it any better than Huxley. Well, Huxley's quote also says "his play is always fair and just." So is mine, within the framework of my rules. What in the hell do you think you're doing, slamming the phone down in the middle of the trace? You think you're going to catch him on a trace? What he does is planned out well in advance. The only way you're going to get him is to rattle him, make him slip up. You never know how you catch a suspect. Excuse me Captain, but I think Peter's right. This guy's got to be forced into making a mistake. - We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor. - Well, maybe you should. You don't tell us how to run our investigation, pal. You got that? You don't have an investigation without me. You got that? You two through with this? What do you want to say, Kathy? I was going to say, I think we ought to play up to his ego more. The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take. Okay, what about this Huxley? What is that? He was referring to a quote by Thomas Huxley: "The chess board is the world, the rules of the game are what we call Nature. The player on the other side is hidden from us. But we know that his play is always fair, just, and patient. We also know, that he never overlooks a mistake." You know you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to. Me? We always talk about me. What about you? What about me? - I don't know, where is Erica's mother? - She died in a car accident. - I'm sorry... - It was a long time ago. - It must have been hard on Erica. - It was. And you? Do you want me to lay down, Doctor? Why don't you just ask me what you want to know? Was it serious between Debi and me? No. Have I known lots of girls like her? None of your business. Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you begin playing games? - I'm not playing a game now. - Yes you are. You're playing word games. - What is this? - I'm just trying to get to know you better. - By attacking me? - Attack you? Who could attack you? You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impassable. You've become trapped behind your own defenses. You're cut off from everyone around you. What are you talking about? You don't even know me. Does anyone? Are you forfeiting? No. I just don't want to fight with you. Then show me who you are, Peter. I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time. You have to face the things you feel. What happened to facing the things we feel? You can turn everything around so easily. - This isn't just another game, is it? - No. - I'm hungry. - Want to call room service? I hate hotel food. - What about a pizza place? - Good. - Rondi's is right down the street. - Okay, I'm going to take a shower. - What do you want on it? - You! - Did you call? - There's no answer. I'm going to try again. Where are you going? I'm going to go pick up the pizza. They're not delivering. - Didn't you say the line was busy? - It was, and then I got through. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Why are you backing up then? The phone book... I was looking for connections between names, addresses. Anything that might be the same about them. You're as bad as Andy... maybe worse. - Peter, you have to admit... - Admit what?! That I was right about you in the steam room?! That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want? Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room? - Peter... - How could you think that, Kathy? How could you even consider it? Ladies and gentlemen, since Grandmaster Sanderson leads the tournament with nine wins, and Grandmaster Yurilivich is in second place with eight, we have decided that the remaining games between Grandmasters Sanderson and Yurilivich will be held separately. Thank you. - Rook C2. - Yes. - What is it? - Mate in five. Queen E3. He didn't see it. Check. Daddy? Here. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Baby. He just got lucky tonight, that's all. You'll cream him next time. I sure will. You have something you want to say? Just wanted to know whether you'd like to talk. - About what? - Whatever's on your mind. - Who says something's on my mind. - What do you see here? - I know. Mate in five. - Why move E3? - Obviously because I didn't see it. - Is it Kathy? - No, it's not Kathy. - Who's Kathy? When I told you to live your life, I didn't mean you to start in the middle of a match. I told you it's not Kathy. - Who's Kathy? - I know you better than you think, Peter. Who's Kathy? Alan... God, you scared the hell out of me. She'd just arrived from Seattle and we decided to share an apartment. She have a boyfriend? No. Does the name Peter Sanderson mean anything to you? No. God, how could somebody do something like this? - Captain? You got a call. - Who is it? Dr. Sheppard. - Yeah, it's the same shoe all right. - No doubt about it. - Was there anyone else on the grounds? - A few people. Did anyone stand out? - What do you mean, stand out? - Did anyone look suspicious? Think! Well, now that you mention it there was somebody who looked kind of suspicious. What was suspicious about him? He was holding a sign that said "Serial Killer", all right? Miss? Excuse me. You said earlier Mary Albert moved out here from Seattle. How long ago was that? - Just a few months ago. - How did you find your apartment? - Through a rental agency. - I see. Well thank you very much. What's up? You told me that Debi Rutlege found her place recently, right? - Yeah. So? - Come on. Yes. You've been very helpful. Thank you. Well, that's it! All the girls rented new homes in the last year and they rented it from? Roxbridge Rentals. This is great for a headache. All our listings are in this computer. We don't keep any other files. Who else works here besides you? There's a girl that helps the counter part-time, that's it. - Anyone else have access to the files? - No one. Okay, thank you. - Dead end? - Detour. - Hi. You must be Erica. - Uh-huh. I'm Kathy. - Is your dad home? - He should be right back. - Would you like to come in? - Yes, please. Thank you. So are you enjoying yourself while you're on the island? - Not really. It's pretty boring. - Boring? That's just because you don't know where to go. Do you like hiking? Sailing? - Fishing? - Yuck! No way! - What do you like? - Boys. - Do you like my dad? - Of course I like your dad. Oh, you mean do I "like"-like him? - I know he really likes you. - Really? How do you know? Did he say something? No, but I can tell. A woman knows these things. - Why don't you go down and see Jeremy. - Okay. - Nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you. - I like her, she's nice. - Yeah, yeah, get out of here. - Hello. - Hello, Peter. Do you have you any idea what the message is? Well, if it's so important, why don't you tell me? I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing very well. - You like to brag, don't you? - Credit should be given where it's due. I'm not worldly like you, Peter. I'm not an internationally known figure. I'm just a poor guy who has never been anywhere, but I am beating you. Why were you looking for Doctor Sheppard today? - What? - You heard me. What were you doing at the institute looking for her? What makes you think I was there? I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. The game's almost over, Peter and you're running out of time. No, it's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're just wondering how much do I really know. How close I'm getting. Well, I'm getting pretty close, pal... and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall! Very nice speech, Peter. Did you rehearse that, or was that impromptu? There's an old wooden bench in the garden. Next to it is a rock. You'll find a message for you under it. Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are. "Peter, in a fierce magazine you will find a hint of my action to come: as large as you maybe in the world of pawns and castles you are still light years from reaching me. Invisible as the air one hundred men with their desperate pleas to stop, can't move me." - Why does he set this line apart? - For emphasis? - Exactly. It's the key. - What does he mean by "fierce magazine"? - Violent? - A "fierce magazine"... brutal... An angry magazine... A war magazine... - A scary... - Mad! - What? - Mad! Mad Magazine! - Do we have the note? - We just put it on the board. No, I need the original note. - Right here. - Maybe... The kids at the clinic love to read Mad Magazine. You fold the pages just right, the text reads differently. Peter, in a fierce action to come, as large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me. - It doesn't make any sense. - That's because we don't understand it yet. - But a hundred men could move him. - He's not talking about himself. Then why don't you tell me what he is talking about then? If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it. All right, let's back up and look at what we do know. These girls all the same type. They were all murdered at night. They moved into new quarters in the last year and they all rented from the same place... - Roxbridge Rentals. - I thought the rental place was a dead end? It's got to be more than coincidence. Someone was accessing the files. The woman who works that place has a son. We're trying to locate him. We're also checking on the cleaning service. He moves around a lot. Why? He finds his victims through Roxbridge Rentals. He goes where they are. They rent so many places. Why should he move all over the island? Jesus. It can't be that easy. What? You want to tell us what the hell you're doing? He told us and we missed it! He said he's never been anywhere. Therefore, this island is the world to him. As far as he's concerned, this is a map of the world. That's why he quoted Huxley. "The chessboard is the world." He's using the map as a chessboard. The son of a bitch is playing chess with me. Wait a minute. How can he be playing chess with you? - You haven't made a move against him. - Maybe I already have. E2-E4. D2-D4. It must be an opening. He starts the game, he is white. B1-C3. And C1-F4. It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening. - David? - Yeah. Can you get into the federation records? Sure, we got a modem line hooked up with the database in New York. Can you bring up the tournament records of the past ten years? Mister Sanderson, there could be hundreds of thousands of games. We're only interested in the names of people that have played opposite Mr. Sanderson. Now what? Now search for anyone who used that opening against me. There should be less than a handful. The first is 1983. Lionel Baines. Boston... No, no, no. He died two years ago. Hans Korshaud. No. He's seventy years old and lives in Holland. - What is it? - New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich. Okay, he's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using the girls as chess pieces. Okay, you found all the girls in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse. He had to move to that grid in order to follow the game he played against you, right? Right, D4. It's a commercial area. No one lives there. Well, that's where he had to place the body to make the move. Now that we know what stage of the game he's at, can you guess what his next move is going to be? Well, his last move was C1-F4. My next move would be F8-G7. So his move should be F1-C4. Right here! You want me to what? I want you to take all the streets in this grid and feed them into your computer. As large as castles, you are still light as the air one hundred men can't move me. It's posed as a question. What am I? - A building? - A building isn't as light as the air. What's large, light as the air and can't be moved? As large as castles. Yeah. Why say castles if you mean a general type of structure? He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it. He names castles... plural. Then says "can't move me." Singular. Why not say "can't move us"? A shadow. What's as big a castle? As light as air, but one hundred men can't move it? The shadow of the castle. Are there any buildings with the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across... Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms. That's got to be it. Okay. The rental agency gave us the name Laura Owens. She moved into an apartment across from the Castle Arms a week ago. We're sending her over to stay with her parents in Seattle. Where the police over there are going to watch her tonight. Officer Gordon, I want you to spend the night in her apartment. Andy, I want you to go over to the hotel stick with Yurilivich through the tournament, and wherever he goes afterwards, all right? With any luck tonight, we're going to wrap this up. - You all set? - Want to tuck me in? Maybe later. - Everybody in position? - All set. What happened? There seems to be a problem with the board. It's going crazy. Gentlemen, the computer's down. It will take several hours. Adjourn until tomorrow? Ladies and gentlemen, our expert tells us that the computers will take several hours to repair. Forgive us, ladies and gentlemen. Until tomorrow then. Thank you. I'm getting a bad feeling about this. If Yurilivich was making a move, Andy would have called by now. - You think we're in the wrong place? - No, this has got to be it. It's the only building around here with the name "Castle" in it. Around here. What does that mean "around here"? Well, there's the Castle Crown apartments over on Pine Road. - But this is all the way across town. - Why the hell wasn't I told that before? It's in another grid. You said you only wanted us to... I said I wanted options, goddamn it! This guy's a psychopath for Christ's sake! How is she? - She's going to make it. - You all right? I've seen a lot of things in my time on this job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich? I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel. Come on, move it. Get it up there. What about Sanderson? Spoke to Jeremy, he's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match, he hasn't come back since. Well, find him. I want to talk to him. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I come in? - Sure. Thank you. The other night I... ...said some things that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did. I'm not looking for an apology, Peter. When this is over maybe we could... I want someone I can feel close with. I don't think that's possible with you. You really haven't seen my best side. - Peter... - Remember how you said, I hide myself behind my chessboard? Well, ever since my wife died I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again. Afraid of losing them. You're wife died. You shouldn't feel responsible for that. It wasn't an accident! She drove her car over that cliff. Oh, the police said it was an accident, but I knew. I've always known. I closed myself off to her. And then... ...I found the letter and I closed myself off to everything else. Beating Yurilivich and playing for the title was all I could think about. But then I had a breakdown in the middle of the match. I couldn't go on. I've never opened it. Why not? Because I know what it says. Maybe you're afraid of what it says. Can you stay with me please? Peter. There are many pains we feel in this world. But loving someone who has shut you out of his life has to be the most unbearable of them all. I don't know when things started to change or how we ever drifted so far apart. But I can no longer stand the pain and the emptiness. So I am leaving, going someplace where the pain will finally stop. This is my choice, my release. I only ask that you shield Erica from the truth. and forgive me for what I am about to do. I love you, Jennifer. Doctor Sheppard, what goes on in the mind of someone like this? That's a very general question to try to answer. Is there a usual scenario? Yes, we usually find that they've had a traumatic childhood. He was probably abused by a dominant female figure. That, coupled with the fact that none of these girls were actually raped leads us to believe that he may be impotent or latent homosexual. Regardless, he's acting out some kind of revenge fantasy that probably fulfills some sick sexual needs. - Peter? - Hi, Jeremy. - Where's, Erica? - She went to town with Mrs. Lutz. - Did you hear that? - I did. Feel like practicing? I can't, I've got to meet my friends down in the dungeon. Jeremy, I know this is your dream as much as it is mine. Just want you to know I'm going to do my best. I know you will. You'll win. Where were you last night? Oh, come on. We're not going to go through this again? - Just answer the question. - I went out! Don't fuck with us! Where did you go? - He was at my place. - What time did he get there? About a quarter to one. We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there. - I was at the beach. - Sure you weren't over on Pine Road? - I'm positive. - You're lying. Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddam accusations! You want to arrest me, do it! Otherwise back off. It's a big game to you isn't it? A sick, fuckin' game. I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what, but we're going to find out. You gave us just enough information to send us to the wrong place, didn't you? It must've shocked the hell out of you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish. I'm not going to listen to this. - Yes you are. - Get off me! - Come on! - You want to shoot me, so shoot me! You going to answer that? Peter, please! - Hello. - Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? - Have you figured out what I'm doing? - You're playing the Tarakoss opening. - Very good! - Your next move should have been F1-C4. I used a variation. You should have anticipated that. - Have you figured out the message? - What word did you leave last night? The police haven't told you? The police. They think we're doing this together. Interesting concept. I hadn't thought of that. If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it. I'm starting to think it doesn't mean anything. "Remember eventually revenge..." You're hopeless! You can't even read a sentence! Didn't they teach you punctuation in school? The game ends tonight! "Remember" "Eventually" "Revenge" "Is" "Carefully". Carefully what? Have we tried switching the words around? Oh, come on. We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson! It isn't him. Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion as to whether or not he is even capable of doing something like this. Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective. - You can't possibly be unbiased. - He's right, Kathy. What are you accusing me of? Seeing what I want to see? Protecting a murderer? What? We can't trust your judgment anymore. - What does that mean? - It means you're off the case, babe. I don't have a choice here. I can't run the risk of compromising what little information I have and the future actions of the department by sharing information with someone who is emotionally involved with the prime suspect. Sharing knowledge. And what if he's wrong? If you were so sure it was Peter you would've arrested him. And if it isn't, he's going to kill again tonight and we're not doing anything with this message. We'll work on the message. Fine. This stinks. I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and Peter's the easiest choice. The logical choice. - You don't have a shred of evidence! - We'll find the evidence. You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm! Milk and two sugars while you're there. What a bitch, huh? Wagner... He said the game's going to be over tonight. - So the next word is the last one. - Could be anything. Remember eventually revenge is carefully... carefully what? - How did you know it was "carefully"? - Frank told me. No he didn't. - No the killer did. - When? When he said, "think about the way Anton Berger plays chess". Anton Berger wrote one of the most famous books on chess called "Principals and Tactics". The first chapter is his three rules to good play: Carefully. Carefully. Carefully. This is not going to be like the phone book, is it? No. No, of course not. - Are you going to come tonight? - Yeah, I'll be there later. - Roxbridge Books. - Sara, hi. It's Kathy Sheppard. Could you look for me and see if you've got a book in on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger. I'll check. Can you hold for a moment? Can you call me back instead? I'm at I'm at 471-3829. - Of course Kathy. - Thanks. You shouldn't have said those things about me on TV. You have no idea what I am. - Peter! - Peter isn't here any more. Help! Help me! Help! Did you see his face? I couldn't see his face, he was wearing a mask. I saw the cut on his wrist. It's Peter. I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with? I've got a room at the institute, I can stay there. Well, go on out there. We'll check back with you later. - King Base 1, this is King 15. - Yeah, this is Wagner. Go. Andy, it's Harton. I'm out at the old pier. I think you and the Captain should come down. - This better be important. - It is, sir. Over. Hello Captain. Fishermen found this tacked on the railing together with the stick and glasses. "Peter, I'm sorry but I just can't do it anymore". What is it? A voice modulator. He was never there when the calls came in. He's been covering for Sanderson the whole time. Get a hold of Judge Meyerson. I want a search warrant for Peter Sanderson. Kathy, what are you doing here? Kathy! What is it? Kathy... I was... such an idiot! Hey what are you doing?! Are you crazy?! Peter Sanderson, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. - Are you feeling better? - I just can't believe it. You don't want to believe it. It's a normal reaction. How come the police have no record of Peter from before? These things don't come out of nowhere. There has to be some kind of history, right? - We found our killer. - Jeremy was my best friend! He would never have killed himself! I knew him like he was my father! Maybe he got tired of covering up for you. You might have gotten away with it, if you hadn't attacked Kathy. What? Sara, hi, it's Kathy Sheppard. Remember I called you earlier about that chess book? Yes, Kathy. We called you back but you weren't home. We have the book. Listen, I need you to do me a really big favor, okay? Look in the first chapter, the author talks about three rules to chess. Can you tell me what they are, please? Of course. Here it is. Oh, they're all the same! - Can you tell me what they are, please? - "Carefully". "Carefully". "Carefully". Thank you. The Chess Federation got you a lawyer. Here's his number. You've got three minutes. Looks like he's ready for round two to me. I've got a feeling we're going the distance with this guy. Let him sweat. Hello? Peter Sanderson calling for Richard Boyd please. - Hello, Peter. - You son of a bitch! You're a sore loser, Peter. Cutting my hand like yours was a brilliant move, don't you think? Listen, if you kill tonight, I'm in jail, they're going to know it's not me. By that time the game will be over. Anyway, I figured out the message. No you haven't. Even if you had, it doesn't matter. Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call. Come on, Peter. Think, think, think! Kathy, please. I'm getting dizzy watching you. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous. - You're safe. He won't come here now. - He already did once. - Why did he? - Why did he what? - Why did he come here? - He was watching you. That's what we think. But what if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here? You're losing me. What if he came here because he's a patient. An out-patient? Remember, period! That's what he meant by punctuation. Remember what? Everything with him was in word games. Arranged, arranged... Shit! - I figured out the message! - Sit the fuck down, Sanderson. I figured out the message! Hold it! Wait, wait, wait! He's going to kill my daughter! Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? He wants me out of the way! I understand that this is just another one of your games. You're so fucking stupid you can't even see what's in front of your eyes! Andy... I'll talk to him. Wagner! Listen, I'll do anything you want! I'll sign anything you want! Send a car to the hotel, please! All right. I confess. I killed them. I killed them all! Oh my God. - Lock him up. Where is Detective Wagner? - He just left. - Where'd he go? - I don't know. - Send a car now! - No car! It's over Sanderson! Don't move! Give me the gun. Come on! On the floor. Give it to me. Don't move. Okay. In the cell. Come on! Lock the door. Keys to the cuffs. Come on! Great. This is just great! Come on. Boy, you scared me. - Who else is here with you? - No one. - Come with me. - I can't. I have to wait for my dad. I don't have time to argue with you, Erica. - Hey, whoever's there, get us out of here! - Frank? - Kathy. - Is that you? Get us the hell out of here. Erica! Erica! God! Oh, God! Yes?! Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. - It's check, Peter. - Let me speak to my daughter. No, I can't do that. I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead. Yet. - Goodbye, Peter. - Please, wait! - The game's over and you lost. - It's me you want. Let her go! No, as usual, you're wrong. It's her I want. Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat. That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley? "His play is always fair and just." You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now. I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please! Don't beg, Peter. I can't win unless she dies. A few seconds. Where can you go in a few seconds? The noise. I know that noise. - I know where you are, David. - Very good. How did you know? The pump. Excellent. It doesn't matter though. You still lose. She'll still be dead before you can get down here. Checkmate. Drop the razor! Put the phone down. Computers. That's the way you got into Roxbridge Rentals' records. - You can get into anything. - Yes I can. Including your mind! I'm in there right now aren't I, Peter? I'll always be with you, no matter how this turns out. You think that I put you through some big ordeal. It is nothing compared to what you caused me. In your eyes, I was just another small-town boy to be crushed beneath the shoes of the great child genius. Nothing I could have done to you... Nothing warrants what you did! Pain is relative, remember? You cannot judge mine. Stay where you are! You still haven't figured it out, have you? Tell me Peter, do you have scars? Scars? From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen? We were only children... Oh, Jesus! Oh, God. Son of a bitch! Basement. Daddy! Don't do it, daddy! No! Daddy, don't! Daddy! Daddy! - Kathy! Kathy, Kathy, help! - Erica! Kathy! We're coming. David! David! Kathy! David! David. If you do this, you are not going to win. You're going to lose! - Again! - You don't understand why I have to do it. Yes, I do! Yes, I do! I found your file, David. I understand. But this is not going to bring back your mother. My daddy left. And my mommy. There was so much blood. It covered everything. You feel bad for not helping you mommy, right? I should have stayed with her. That's why I stayed with the others. I cleaned them, I washed them, so they'd look nice when they go see my mommy. I'm sure your mommy knows that. I'm sure she understands. Children make mistakes, David. It's okay. David, put down the knife now, David, please. Just put down the knife. David... Put down the knife now, David. I can't. Game's over. .
