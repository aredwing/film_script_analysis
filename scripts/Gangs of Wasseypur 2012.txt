Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! When the world.. ..will sleep, At the stroke of the midnight hour.. lndia will awake to life. The real war began after the freedom. After British left, all the mines.. ..were distributed to Tata, Birla and Thapa. But there were very few who understand business. And Ramadhir benefited the most by this decision. He became a big head. And few mines were handed over to him. But without the labours, neither British.. ..nor these businessmen could run the mines. And also not Ramadhir. - Will you work for me? l'm already in your service. Will you be my special worker? You won't lack anything in life. Yes. - Now, l've got the contract of these mines. All the coals produced here will be mine. Profit and loss, everything is mine. After the British, now the labours think that.. ..the workload will reduce and they'll get more wages. But it's not true. We've to increase the production. For which we need more coal. We've to dig it more. We've to dig a new mine.. ..on the place where the labours live. Get lost! British had money. So they provided salary as well as shelter. We're not that capable. We'll pay them by which they can arrange their shelter on their own. What happened? Why aren't you working? Sir, we've been met with injustice. Our houses are set on fire. We've families. l'm going inside for refreshment. l shouldn't see anyone here when l come out. C'mon, get back to your work! Get lost! Join your duty. But you're one of us. Get lost! C'mon! Do you want an invitation? C'mon. Shahid! - Yes. You think.. ..you're treating your friends correctly? No one is a friend here. British had left a piece of bread. And monkeys came later. And what do you think? Ramadahir Singh's father had left the mines for him? Earlier British owned it.. ..and now Ramadhir Singh. And in future, l'll own the mines by killing Ramadhir Singh. Shahid Khan! l'll see! Yes! Sir is calling him. He's in the jeep. Yes, l'll send him. Ramadhir Singh is waiting for you in the jeep. Why is he here? lt's very precious goods. lt has to reach Benaras this night. Benaras? Atrain will leave from Dhanbad station after 20 minutes. l've got your ticket. Let's go. l didn't inform my son, he'll wait for me. l'll send a message. Let's go to sleep. Whose umbrella it is? lt was lying here. Really? Show me. Ramadhir Singh? Escaped! And the child? - He's killed. And the dead body? l buried its pieces. Mr Yadav? Shahid Khan. Mr Ramadhir.. ..has sent money. lt's pistol, right? Will you show me? Running and rattling.. ..playing with the rocks.. changing it's side every now and then, what's made of water drops? That has four letter name? Ganga! Shahid Khan didn't return. We knew he will never. Sardar grew up with my nephew Asgar. One day he asked me.. ..about Shahid Khan. l told him that Ramadhir Singh had taken away his father and killed him. After that Sardar's childhood ended. He started thinking about Ramadhir only. Since then he took an oath.. ..that he won't grow hairs on his head.. ..until he'd avenge his father's death. C'mon, anyone for Girdi.. Jaliya. Dhanbad! Ranchi! Wassypur! Will you come? - No. C'mon, anyone for Girdi? Girdi! Jaliya! Ranchi! Dhanbad! Girdi! Jariya! Dhanbad! Wassypur! Girdi! Ranchi! Dhanbad! Wassypur! Girdi! Saradar Khan, son of Shahid Khan.. ..your marriage with Ms Nagma, daughter of lmtiyaz Ahmed.. ..has been fixed keeping all the terms. Do you accept this marriage? Yes! l do... Do you accept this marriage? - Yes! l do... Do you accept this marriage? Do you accept this marriage? Do you want water? Sardar! Coming! Singh will leave from Jariya. Let's vacate them. He killed my father My father sat in his car and gone with him he never came back l have only object in my life Revenge! l can't see Ramdheer Singh's progress l have to finish that bastard l won't shoot him l will make fun of him l will show him his value Slowly, slowly l will snatch everything from him so he will die.. Respectable Mr Ramadhir Singh. Long live! Long live! Long live! l am standing on this stage and promise you that we'll defeat the opposition. ln 1952 when Jagjivan Raam was announced Minister To change the situation of that time. so he announced.. ..Coal Welfare Association to see labour's condition as per that National Trade Union has been established As per that Supervisors pressurized Coal Mines Owners and Ramadheer Singh was the Leader of that movement This trade union has become a face of Mafia. Union Leader has become contractors and they were raising funds to make other labours to their workers They gave money on interest and they keep their salaries for interest What will l eat from this? New contractors came one by one Ramadhir singh was already a contractor. He has become a politician and won the election, too. My dad run coal mines for many years His name is Ramadhir Singh. l know how.. ..how contractors and labours.. ..stealing coal and sell in black markets l won't let this black marketing happen My profit should be great Coal is a great thing lt looks like stone but it's not thick like stone it's light weighted if you will put it into the water Now it will soak the water. And it will become.. Heavy ls it? Yes. - Come in. After this privatization.. you are facing many injustices Our union... Union for labours. lt's lending us money and taking our salaries as interests. And how it's happening lt's all happening under Chief... Stop, where are you going? l have told you that my share should be same like other contractors l am sending the stuff as per your demand lt's going... ..but it's not reaching there. Until S.P. Sinha will alive till then nor we will eat something neither we will have house. What do you think? S.P. Sinha isjust educated. He is writing in his office. How do he know how people are stealing. We don't have food to eat. And he is gardening outside his house. You shouldn't break the flower Just play with it. okay? Hey, Ramadhir! Catch him! With privatization, government took the mines back from Ramadhir.. ..and handed over to Coal lndia.. ..which was under S.P. Sinha. Ramadher Singh has become contractor from Owner. And after killing S.P. Sinha Ramadheer's terror has increased.. ..which made him a first don of Dhanbad. Your father was a big man. Move. Where is Sardar Khan? Sardar khan came here Sardar Khan! ln the opposite room. Who's it? What do you mean? She says that she is Nagma. She said she is Nagma? And you too think she is Nagma. What do you think of me? l didn't found out Didn't you think of anything before doing this? Were you walking in sleep? Seriously. l couldn't realize. She took advantage of me. No.. What are you doing? She will die Let her die There'll be a murder. - Move. Leave it. She'll get hurt. l said move, or else l'll kill you. Listen to me. l won't spare you alive Leave it. Nagma! Stop! Where are you running? Some day you will come home. Rogue! No.. Calm down! Have patience. Push! Get lost! My son! My child! Smile! Smile for me! Smile for me! Smile for me! Take him! My child! My prince! My child! Please forgive me What is it? - l don't know. What is it? Just there's something. Nothing could happen right now Why? Somebody is inside my womb. So, l am not taking him out. Don't you feel shame? You will make your kid dirty? This is not right... When somebody is already inside So you should control your self You're right. l'm tired of telling him. He is born evil. There has to be a lone horse amongst mare. When Darish was to be born.. ..nine months passed away. Even after his birth, one month passed just like that. And now she's carrying again. C'mon, the food is ready. Coming. What do we do? Should we live life or not? We too have lived that way. Wonder how you lived. You want to quench your thirst.. ..you can go anywhere you want. Don't bring anyone home. Otherwise, l'll kill her. And wherever you go, take a bath before you leave. Who's going out? Eat your food. You'll get power. Don't bring me shame outside.
