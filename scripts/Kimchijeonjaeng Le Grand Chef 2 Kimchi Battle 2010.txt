I've prepared some food to suit your tastes. Try some. Thank you. How does it taste? It's absoIuteIy deIicious. A taste of the oId with something new. It's hard to find something Iike this even back home. Is that so? The profound taste of our BuIgogi and Kimchi is amazing. It's Yakiniku and Kimuchi, representative Japanese food. I'm gIad you Iike it. May I ask who made this food? They were aII quite pIeased. Chef? They were aII very pIeased. CongratuIations, ma'am.

The government announced to hoId a Kimchi Contest ''KIMCHI CONTEST TO BE HELD'' to reaffirm Kimchi has originated from our country. Now, they get it. - What? - Nothing. PIease continue. Why Sang-ju dried persimmons are so good. This is a Iump of vitamins. It heIps with hangovers, Iow energy, and... Forget aII that! Most important! It's awesome on men's sexuaI stamina. Nature made viagra! Ah, excuse me. Yes, Chief? Did you see the news? About the Kimchi contest? Yes. Where's Sung-chan? Why are you asking me? Then who eIse wouId I ask? We got pIenty of sunshine this year. It's pretty sweet. - It's the best! - Of course. I'II take 30 bundIes. - Sure. - And a box of haIf-dried ones, too. - HaIf-dried ones? - Yes. - Mr. Kim! - Yes? Why does he get so startIed when I caII him? Get me a box of haIf-dried persimmons, too. Yes, sir. Is he new? He's not from around here. Where'd he say he's from? He's a good man. I'm Iucky to have good workers. It was an honor serving with you. If you ever need me, I'II come right over. It was an honor for me, too. I heard it's a beautifuI pIace. What in the name of Kimchi! Over my dead body! No way! Just a moment! ArnoId? And 20 owned by... Korean Federation of Community Credit. What beIongs to you is... this front gate and a coupIe of trees here. Why you IittIe! Watch it! This is expensive. Ma'am? Try to convince him, ma'am. You never know what can happen. Did I give you my card? Yes, I have it. We'II caII you. Have a nice, good day! Get Iost. I'm home! Who was that? We're cIosed today? You show up in 6 months and that's aII you have to say? HeIIo, sir. I'm home, Mother. It's good to see you. I wanted to come but business has been reaIIy busy. Sorry. You missed me, Mother? Good to see you, too, Jin-soo. HeIIo. I'm so hungry, ma'am. You two are the same. You never show without Sung-chan. Want some Kimchi mixed noodIes? I dreamed about your noodIes these days. Wash up whiIe I make it. Yes, Mother. HoId stiII! Eat sIowIy, you'II choke. What did you put in here? I've never tasted anything so good! Why can't I make it this good? You reaIIy don't know? It's aII in the Kimchi. ThinIy sIiced ripe Kimchi. But you! Your Kimchi is too bitter. You mean it's spicy, right? It's so good. - Are you sick? - It's just coId medication. When did you cIose this pIace? About two weeks ago. I'm sorry. I shouId've been here. It's okay. I just feeI so bad sending our reguIar customers away. Someone's at the door. Those fooIs! I'II get them. Take that! Jang-eun? You haven't changed a bit in ten years, Mom. StiII gracefuI. And stiII pretty. I changed a Iot, haven't I? You're the same. Pretty as aIways. No, I've changed a Iot. But I Iike it now, better. Those who wouIdn't Iet me hoId a knife in the kitchen cuz I'm a girI... can't even Iook me in the eyes now. That's the way Koreans are. Making stupid traditions and customs as they wish... But stiII how couId you not come once in 10 years? And what did you do to heIp Mom? WeII... Now you can be in charge of Chunyang-gak and heIp out. With your taIents you'II... Mom's sick cuz of this pIace. So forget this pIace and traveI and stuff. I'II take care of everything. That's why I came back. To be here with you, Mom. No more restaurants. Forget it. How about some fruit? Can you teII me about Sung-chan's birth mother? Why aII of a sudden? He seems more Iike a son than her reaI daughter. AIways so curious. Oh, Iook at the time! I have so many peopIe wanting to meet me. I'II come back tomorrow. - Jang-eun. - Yes? I read the Ietter you sent. But... Not Chunyang-gak. What do you mean? You're not trying to change this pIace but to get rid of it. Fine. Let's taIk Iater. I can't stand this pIace. Your Gisaeng days isn't the onIy thing that hurt me. TeII me! How was I born? You didn't have me out of Iove. You know how sick that makes me feeI? How fiIthy that makes me? I'II tear the pIace down and start over! You're notjust a woman... but my mother. And I'm your onIy daughter. Leaving so soon? You'II come back, right? Seeing you reminds me of our cook offs. I didn't stand a chance back then. Yeah, I remember pIaying with you Iike that. We didn't have any other friends. Don't try and stop me. Even if the whoIe worId does, you can't do that to me. But this pIace is our home. It pIayed a part in you becoming a great chef. You think this pIace is stiII Ieft in my cooking? Maybe it's in you, but not me. I'm resetting aII the tabIes. I'II start from there. Don't worry. It'II aII work out. Look. She's going to buiId something Iike this. The head chef of the Japanese Prime Minister's residence. Never wouId've guessed she's your sister. Here with me today is... Chef Jang-eun who became the best in Japan despite prejudices. PIeased to meet you. It must've been hard to step down. Is there a speciaI reason why you're entering the Kimchi contest? I couIdn't negIect our native food faIIing behind in the fIow of gIobaIization any Ionger. Why don't you enter the Kimchi contest? You can win reward money and Kimchi rights to government restaurants to be made worIdwide. It'II be a chance to show Chunyang-gak Kimchi to the worId. Then paying off the debts wiII be easy. I don't Iike cooking contests. It feeIs Iike I'm being judged Iike a criminaI on my cooking. Isn't it uncomfortabIe being judged when you're such a renowned chef? No. I tend to enjoy it. It's Iike studying hard for a test, then waiting for the scores. I guess you can reIax and enjoy the contest. Of course not. I have to do my best in finding the ingredients to making new recipes. There are many hidden masters in the worId. Then I guess the winner of the Kimchi contest is aIready set. Not man enough to even try... CIose your eyes. Hands up if you don't have a father. CIose your eyes! Jang-eun, you don't have a dad? Didn't you know? She doesn't even know who he is. How can you not know who your father is? She's a Giseng's daughter! - She's a Giseng's daughter! - Don't pIay with Jang-eun. She has no roots. She doesn't even know who her dad is. Try and deceive my eyes... But you can't fooI my tongue. What? - HeIIo, sir. - HeIIo. Hi. It's a crime to Iie about where the produce is from. Lie? What if it's written correctIy? CaII someone and check. I'm an expert. You don't get it, do you? I can cIose this pIace down. - Who are you? - It's Korean. - The cabbage is from Hae-nam. - Yes, that's right. Korean cabbages from Hae-nam are sweeter and bigger. The cabbage may be from here but the seasoning's Chinese. Chinese powdered pepper is redder than ours. You can teII just by Iooking. It's Korean. Chinese Kimchi has too many pepper seeds. And the cabbage is Iess crunchier and mushy tasting. - Try it again. - Forget it. We don't fooI around with the food here. See? No reason to spend so much on every side dish. Of course there is. Korean... My reguIar customers. Hey, checkered shirt! BAE Sung-chan, son of Mrs. Lee of Chunyang-gak. AIways right on time. AIways here from I think I can get through to you. My name's just Sung-chan. I'm not trying to threaten you here. I can't get through to the oId foIks. But precise peopIe Iike us can taIk. DiaIogue, you know? We're working day and night to turn the neighborhood into a kick ass pIace. Kick ass? You Iike that? Just kidding. Anyway. CaII me. Let's go. It's Iaminated. Have a nice day! I'II take care of that man. You work on Jang-eun, Mother. It's okay. I have so much debt... If it's time to go... I shouId do what she wants. Are you cIosed today? The door was open. Are you cIosed today? I'm sorry. We're cIosed for the moment. Mother wiII be so disappointed. We came from the States. What do we do? Everyone came together for my Father's anniversary of death. We had so many memories in this pIace. Escort them in. There aren't many side-dishes, wiII that be okay? Let's aII eat! Have some, Mother. Eat sIowIy. You'II choke. It was before you came here. She said she aIways wanted to eat here once. She came for her first son's birthday. She ordered one meaI and fed three chiIdren. I feIt bad and gave her a few extra dishes. She didn't forget and came back. Once a year for over 10 years untiI she moved to the States. Being unabIe to be here for the customers any Ionger is... what hurts the most. You sure you don't want some? I'm fine. You never changed a bit. I can teII what you're about to say. Don't mention the restaurant. I don't want to fight with you, too. Maybe my face does show what I'm thinking. I'm entering the Kimchi contest. - Are you out of your mind? - No, I'm perfectIy fine. You were aIways the one making bets, remember? If I wanted something, I had to win a bet first. Let's do that with Chunyang-gak, too. The winner gets to decide. That'II be fair. Did Mom put you up to this? Or is this your idea? It's 100 my decision. You onIy have reasons to get rid of Chunyang-gak... But I reaIized there are way more peopIe with reasons to keep it. That's why. I'm covering the Kimchi contest! Let the first Korea Kimchi Contest begin! We're at the Kimchi festivaI heId prior to the contest. What do you think about this contest? There's an oId Samaritans saying, 'What you eat is who you are.' It shows how important food is to human deveIopment. I can't wait to see how our great food wiII be presented here. I Iike Kimchi pizza better than Western pizza. You're making Kimchi soup, sir? For a good home cooked famiIy meaI, it's aII you need. Who brought the radish kimchi? She sneaked it. I did not! - Kimchi! - Kimchi! - Thank you! - Kimchi's deIicious. Let's aII give another big round of appIause! The Minister of AgricuIture wiII announce the contest's topic. The first topic is befitting to our proud Kimchi. A part of our proud history and cuIture White-cIad Nation. The history of our Kimchi dates back before red peppers were introduced. Non-spicy Kimchi has a much Ionger history. Different types have been deveIoped in various regions. I highIy Iook forward to the Kimchis you'II make next week! You have to make something more speciaI than just white Kimchi. I think that's the purpose of this contest. Your heIper's not bad. You heard the topic. Not using red pepper and making the Kimchi on the spot. What do you think wiII be the winning factor? You can never beat me. That's the way it was and aIways wiII be. But if you insist... Fight tiII the end. She's something aII right. Look at aII that confidence. Why doesn't she just teII us the answer? How annoying! That's 10 year-oId bay saIt. It's nice. Take it and stop bothering me. But this isn't what I'm Iooking for either. I toId you. I need the best saIt there is. I need naturaI sea saIt. They seII it in stores. Go find it there. Not stuff made in factories. I didn't come here for that. I need naturaI sea saIt made the traditionaI way. I'II pay whatever you want. - How much... - Look. Some things can't be bought. Forget it. You make it yourseIf. Then pIease teII me how. Hi, Sung-chan. - Hi, sir. - What can I get ya? Nothing. What's with him? Again? What are you making? TeII me and I'II heIp you. I can't use just any saIt. Use the stuff I bought you. I paid a Iot for it. My editor even brushes his teeth with bamboo saIt. It's good for the body, but it's not good to make Kimchi with. The top chefs in the country won't make Kimchi with store-bought saIt. It's so frustrating. Jang-eun's probabIy out seIIing her souI for the perfect saIt. Aren't you worried? ShouIdn't you make a new pIan or get some saIt somewhere? CuIturaI city of the worId In the artisticaIIy rich city of Gwang-ju Let the Kimchi contest begin! Let's see what ingredients are inside the jars! Let's aII go into the wonderfuI worId of Kimchi! The chefs have just two hours. They must turn their ingredients into the best Kimchi they can make! There are 3 contests over 3 weeks, correct? Judged on taste, appearance, and creativity, And in the finaI round, the top two finaIists wiII compete. There's onIy one hour Ieft. They're finaIIy using the saIt. Compared to the renowned Guerande SaIt from France, our bay saIt has three times more magnesium and iron. Dr. OH, Mrs. GONG, and Chief KIM of Min. for Food, AgricuIture, Forestry... and otherjudges wiII decide who wiII make it to the next round. It's a type of cabbage used often in saIads. Making Kimchi with kohIrabi? It's not traditionaI. The contest does not insist on onIy traditionaI dishes. I think our food cuIture progressed the most than any other country. Thus our representative food, Kimchi, is no Ionger the main dish. It's become just another side dish. I thought Kimchi couId be turned into a great appetizer. A dish that gives a pIeasing first impression to the meaI. Kimchi can feeI famiIiar Iike the western saIad. Therein Iies the charm to be accepted by the worId. It tastes Iike cabbage. Or is it radish? They Iook Iike sweet potatoes. Amazing. Never tasted anything Iike this. A deep, profound taste. TruIy amazing. The saIt... Is it Grey SaIt? It's naturaI sea saIt. It's our traditionaI saIt. Sea saIt? I heard it's recentIy gone into mass production. No, I made this saIt myseIf. In the oId traditionaI way. Tradition meets fusion. It's truIy amazing. Wow, she's reaIIy something. We meet again. TraditionaIIy made southern styIe Kimchi. That's right. Interesting. When everyone eIse used saIt, you used traditionaI soy sauce. - very creative. - Creative, yes. The deep saIty taste of Korean soy sauce brings out the crispy taste of the radish. What do you think Dr. OH? I taste the richness of the sea in the pickIed juice. What do you think Chief KIM? DefiniteIy Korean. The soy sauce is. The scores are going up on board! Hee-don, 225 Joo-young, 275 The finaI resuIt is... Sung-chan 1st pIace! Jang-eun 2nd! Okay! I toId you Sung-chan wiII win! If you couId express the morning caIm with Kimchi, anything wouId do. We'II see you a week from now. Let's faII into the wonderfuI worId of Kimchi once again! Must I stoop to that IeveI? Can I caII you brother? Let me teII ya, brother. The first time I saw you... I knew you were different! Then you're done with our bIock, right? Of course not. You're the first to sign. WeII begun is haIf done! Have a good time and have a nice day! Let's go! Why'd you sign it? You're seIIing this pIace? It shouId be quiet for at Ieast 12 hours. What? 12 hours? What in the worId does that mean? I saw the contest on Tv. WeII done, son. I just got Iucky. The competition is pretty fierce. ReaIIy? Jang-eun was great at cooking since she was young. But you had stronger points, too. - ReaIIy? - Yes. But in your cooking... Come on! Let's go! What about my cooking? Go on. You're headed for the East Sea? Yes. He wants to catch the sun coming up in the East! Mother... You'd better get going. Be carefuI. I hope you get over your coId, soon. Take care. Take care! He'II reaIize on his own. Don't worry. You're not going to make Kimchi with king crabs, are you? Why not? There are over 200 different kinds of Kimchi and countIess ingredients. In the North, they use raw pork to make Kimchi. StiII I never heard of king crabs in Kimchi. King crabs here! FreshIy caught crabs here! - The crabs are so fresh. - Of course. Take your pick. Move! That's mine! - Right? - Ma'am! Not again! What's with her? Isn't he... Persimmons! Right? - Mister! - From Sang-ju? You're him, right? That's the best shop around here. Aren't you coming with us? Yeah, come eat with us. Forget it. I'm fuII just Iooking at my hometown. Oh! Don't forget to ask for some Kimchi. The stuff she makes for her son. Go on. Okay. Here you are. I'm starving from foIIowing you around aII day. Then eat up. Was your son a runner? Pretty smart Iady from SeouI. Right on the money. He was the provinciaI rep. With my Ieg Iike this, I couIdn't feed him weII. But stiII he ran in a fIash. He was in the papers and stuff. See! That's him! Right here. He was so smaII in eIementary schooI. But whenever he ran, he aIways came in first. What? You think I'm Iying? It's the honest truth. Handsome, ain't he? Is he stiII a runner? Ah, no. He's not a runner. He's on the run now. My son wouId never do something Iike that... He's been framed. No matter what they say, a mother knows her chiId. His mama knows who he reaIIy is. I knew it! It gives me the chiIIs. What if he's a seriaI kiIIer? Don't go over board. He didn't seem that bad. PeopIe say that on the news. 'He didn't seem Iike the type to do such a thing.' Wait! Just go! Come on! Drive! I grew up here tiII I was sixteen. Then I Ieft and did everything in the book, you know? You never know what Iife can bring. I drank, got in a scuffIe, and pushed someone sIightIy. Damn Iuck. It was an accident. StiII murder is murder. But I suddenIy missed mama Iike crazy. Cops must have their radars on to catch me. Coming here... It hurts right here. How can I face her? So, teII me. How's my mama? She misses you a Iot. She bragged about you a Iot. ReaIIy? No way. What good did I ever do? I'm nothing but scum. You know what I am to her? Damn bastard! A bastard who cut off his mama's Ieg! Stay back! I wanted to give up everything... and kiII myseIf. But just then... I was dying Iike heII to eat something. What was that? My mama's food. Then go. Go eat the food she makes. Not for you, but for your mother. Mama? Mama? Don't turn the Iight on. Mama! Cops couId be camped outside. Mama! Stop it. Men don't cry. Mama! Are you okay? Let's go back. This is crazy! Sung-chan! You crazy? Going out without teIIing me? Ma'am? Is this the onIy boat that went out Iast night? Didn't you hear the storm? It was reaIIy bad. - Come to buy some crabs? - Yes, but... Wow. Look at the big feIIas. Mama? Are you happy, ma'am? Course. Get married and have kids, you'II see. There are two greatjoys in this worId. One is water going down dry Iand. The other's food going in your kid's mouth. Mama! Son! - Ma'am! - Ma'am! - Mama! - Ma'am! Mama! Mama! She feII down. Let me just heIp her up. Mama! Oh dear god! No! - Mama! - No! No! - Mama! - No! No! No! Come back. No! Mama! No! Come back! No! Come back! I didn't even feed him yet. Dear god. HeIp me! HeIp! - Sung-chan! - HeIp! Sung-chan! CIearance saIe. Take it aII for $5! If they want Iower standards, I'II give it to them. PIease continue. Then what? His reaI mother... She couIdn't hear or taIk since birth. But Sung-chan thought his mom abandoned him. His IoneIiness and Ionging turned into deep hatred. Sung-chan came with a jar of Kimchi. It was his mom's Iastjar of Kimchi. But he didn't eat it and just Iooked at it for days. The fooI. But Sung-chan's mom had no choice. She thought Sung-chan couId get kiIIed if she kept raising him. I shouId keep it cIean, though there's no customers. She Iikes it cIean. It's been over 12 hours. They're dumber than I thought. Hey, mister! What happened to 'brother' in just 12 hours? You're reaIIy something. You're not even IegaIIy married. Jang-eun's address is registered wrong. She's set in not seIIing. But I'm no fooI, you know! No fooI! Right! I'm negotiating with the reaI owner. Ma'am! - Hey! - Where is she? - You fooI! - Sister! - Sister! Sister! - Stop it! Get out of here! No... Let the second round begin! Before we start the contest, Let's find out what the top 10 chefs prepared. With these ingredients? I thought of the East Sea sunrise. So I prepared the goIden poIIack, the best of the East Sea. We know the East Sea's goIden poIIack is famous. But isn't thatjust dried poIIack? Is this it? It Iooks reaIIy fresh. I prepared the king crab caught overnight in the East Sea. I prepared North Korean styIe sweet rice drink with haIibut. I prepared Kimchi bean sprout soup to heIp with hangovers. I prepared ginseng Kimchi for an energetic morning. I prepared wiId ginseng seafood wrap Kimchi. Good work everyone. Let the second round with our The chefs Iook Iike gIadiators in ancient Rome in this round haII. They must reaIIy feeI the tension since they can see each other. How they overcome the tension wiII be the key to winning. There are two greatjoys in this worId. One is water going down dry Iand. The other's food going in your kid's mouth. Mama! She feII down. Let me just heIp her up. Let's go! - Mama! - No! Son! No! No! Mom! Mom! Don't go! Mom! Come back! I had my doubts before. What do you caII this? It's just GoIden PoIIack Kimchi. GoIden PoIIack Kimchi? Our Kimchi meets our goIden poIIack. CouId you expIain a bit further? Of course. WhiIe maintaining our native food's uniqueness I think moderate change is needed to suit the outside worId. Then the worId can open up to Korean customs and tastes. By putting our Kimchi inside onions and yeIIow cucumbers, I made something that Iooks more famiIiar to them. The moist poIIack and Kimchi compIement each other weII. Making this with PoIIack is absoIuteIy magicaI. It's Iow in fat and high-protein. Great for dieting, too. It's good to eat aIone for breakfast, don't you think? Yes. It's deIicious. Yummy. King crab Kimchi, I presume. UsuaIIy they put crab pieces in the Kimchi. But mixing in cooked crab meat is very traditionaI. It's beautifuI. It's the onIy word that comes to mind. Our Kimchi Iooks Iike a work of art. ShaII we? Excuse me. This is... not bad, but... How can I say this? A bitter taste Iingers at the end. I taste something bitter, too. Was there a mistake in mixing the spices? The crab meat tastes kind of fIat and staIe. His resentment towards his mom is rooted deep. Everything he makes has that bitterness in it. Let's thank our 10 finaIists for their hard efforts. WeII done everyone. Let's see our finaIists' running totaIs. Here they are! Joo-young, 528 Jin-wook, 535 Joo-mi, 527 Jang-eun, 575! Our two finaIists are Jang-eun and Sung-chan! Let's find out the topic for the finaI round. The worId's attention is on our Kimchi as the food of Iife. What is the Kimchi that the worId can reIate to? We ask our finaI two chefs for the answer. Here is the topic for the finaI match. Make the best Kimchi you can a week from now! Kimchi that the entire worId can reIate to! CongratuIations. Forget it. It's over. What is? You saw it. It's no use. Stupid. Are you scared? It's not cuz I'm scared. I'm not as good. That's aII. No. Sung-chan... You were scared. Not of Jang-eun, but your reaI mom! You Iet it aII rot. The king crab and your mom's Kimchi. So you know? No matter what she shouId've kept me. That's what parents do. How couId I not know! She's been fighting it for over a year. TiII the cancer spread aII throughout her body... I thought she was taking coId medication. If you didn't get in the way, this wouIdn't have happened. Chunyang-gak was aIways between Mom and me. I wanted to get rid of that barrier. Cuz that's the onIy way I can go back to her. Stop making excuses. Chunyang-gak or not, Mother wanted to hoId you. But you pushed her away. You don't know anything! I wanted to show her why I had to do what I did. But if she dies Iike this... You got in the way. It's aII your fauIt! You're bIaming me, but you're reaIIy bIaming yourseIf on the inside. Am I wrong? I... Go around being a chef... But I don't even have a sense of what Mom's taste is Iike. Though I want to know it! I'm dying to know but can't! Just be honest. You just wanted to beat me. That's aII there is to it. You're too proud to Iose. You're dying to know what Mom's taste is Iike? Whatever. You threw it out of your Iife. Remember! Stop it! Why do you think I threw it out! What about you? Where were you the Iast 10 years! Shut up! Fine. It's aII over. I'II crush you tiII the end. Did you have a dream? I met Sung-chan's mom. But I couIdn't face her. Let's go. Where are we going aII of a sudden? If I toId you, wiII you stop being a vendor? It's your mother's request. She wanted you to find something. What's that? Stop taIking. It's to heIp with your cooking. Start driving! You fooI. Drinking so earIy in the day! It's my onIy friend. How's Sun-geum? Same as aIways. Is this him? I remember you as a boy. Then you're... It was 20 years ago. But I remember it Iike it was just yesterday. Remember? They found her on the fIoor of a saIt storehouse. CerebraI artery rupture. She was aIready brain dead. There was nothing we couId do. Then... A miracIe happened overnight. Something that can't be expIained scientificaIIy. As if she wasn't ready to die... Like she had a desperate reason to Iive... The miracIe Iasted tiII the next day. It wouId've been easier on her to Iet go of Iife. But it was truIy amazing. Your mother couIdn't even hear from birth. Mom? In aII my Iife... I never saw anyone wait so desperateIy for her chiId. HeIp me! HeIp! - Sung-chan! - HeIp! Sung-chan! Hey! Sung-chan! Wake up! Mom! No! Mom! AII the mothers in the worId are... Iike the saIt over there. Though it's the start and finish of aII foods, they meIt their souIs and siIentIy pIay their part. Now, I know why you didn't stop me from entering the Kimchi contest. Looks Iike we aII have one thing Ieft to do. - It's fantastic. - Thanks. I didn't think you couId come. Thank you. I'II aIways come on your invitation. Have you decided on the finaI menu for the contest? No. What do you think? How can I dare judge your cooking... Oh dear. You know why I asked you to come. PIease teII me. They were aII exquisite. I cannot dare rate the dishes you've prepared. But... But? I never saw you so nervous. I never saw you so nervous. You are right. I haven't found the answer yet. No, I think you have. Look at them. They Iook pIeased. The answer couId be there. What do you see? They're Kimchi dishes that suit anyone's tastes. But I think the heart and substance of it aII is eIsewhere. I apoIogize, ma'am. How dare I... No, thank you for being so honest. Going off on his own. Let's see how he does without me. This is good, too. Do whatever you want and die an oId man, aIone! This is not a crime. No, sir! Quiet! Come on! Just find the stamp. Once we stamp the papers... Wait! TeII me what you're making, pIease? I toId you, 'Mom's taste'. You aIways sneak your way out Iike that. - You can win, right? - Of course. What is the Kimchi you think the worId can reIate with? A heart moving taste. I think it is essentiaI to cooking and the true hope of a chef. I beIieve anyone can reIate with food made with such sincerity and heart. The worId may not be abIe to reIate with my Kimchi. I thought of 'Mom's taste'. The number of fIavors in the worId equaIs that of our mothers. If aII mothers' hearts are the same... Maybe everyone in the worId can reIate with this, too. Thank you. 'Heart Touching Taste' against 'Mom's Taste', it is. Here on the stage are the best ingredients from around the country. Our two finaIists aIso brought with them their secret weapons. Kimchi can be made differentIy even with the same ingredients. Our two finaIists wiII have two hours to prepare. Let the Kimchi contest finaIs begin! Sung-chan heId fast to traditionaI methods untiI now. MeanwhiIe, Jang-eun insisted on new fusion methods. Tradition vs. Fusion. I'm curious what the resuIts wiII be. Who do you think wiII win? I'm not sure. In the past, they carefuIIy picked a sacred day to make Kimchi and purified their bodies in preparation. Then the one who took a bath wiII... Winning is aII in mind controI. The Iadies had to be carefuI of one another in making Kimchi. If you get angry, the saIt content in bIood couId disturb the taste buds. Making Kimchi is a very sensitive process. Sung-chan is using a stone bowI. That is a very traditionaI way of Iocking the fIavor in. MeanwhiIe Chef Jang-eun is cooking each ingredient separateIy. She's focused on keeping the ingredients' distinct tastes. CIose up on Jang-eun's hands. I'm so hungry! Can't we try some after the contest? Rip off a big piece of Kimchi and wrap some rice with it! Then you munch it down. You can't get better than that. - That's... - Be quiet! Camera 1 on Sung-chan's hands! What! They're the same! They didn't cheat, did they? Their Kimchis Iook the same! This isn't the SAT's! Eating aIways comes first, right? Yes, sir! Hey, I can't see the Tv, fooI. Wow! What's this? What's in this wine? Damn. This can't be! No way! This tastes Iike... Mom's... The Iong awaited Kimchi contest finaIs judging begins. Aren't they both... Chef Jang-eun? This is traditionaI Korean cabbage Kimchi, not a fusion one. I thought about it Iong and hard. This is the taste that moved my heart. But both your Kimchis Iook Iike normaI, average ones. WiII the worId be abIe to reIate with normaI Kimchi Iike this? PIease expIain further before we taste it. I beg to differ with you. I tried many new Kimchis in the contest, but... Something was missing. Why? It's the Korean cabbage Kimchi that's aIways on our tabIes. But no one made this. Was the contest about making new types of Kimchi? Let me teII you something. I drank water aII night after eating aII the saIty, new Kimchi. How can we give the worId Kimchi that we're not even famiIiar with? It doesn't make any sense. Fine. They can't be disquaIified for making the same Kimchi. Then onIy the taste wiII decide the winner. Wait a second, pIease. What's this? Isn't this against the ruIes? It's the same Kimchi made with the same ingredients. I just had it ripened for a certain period. Kimchi's true taste comes from fermentation. What shouId we do? But there are ruIes in the contest. I prepared ripened Kimchi, too. Then the conditions are the same. Let's try it. There. With a Iot of spices and brine it can easiIy be hot and saIty. But with rice fIour paste, the fIavor is Iocked in weII. But I taste something eIse. It's quite different from other normaI Kimchis. It's weII ripened. This is 'Mom's Taste'. It Iooks the same as 'the Heart Moving Taste'. Mother's taste moves the heart, doesn't it? ShaII we try how different it tastes? - Sure. - Sure. Am I tasting this correctIy? I can onIy say it tastes the same as the first. It's ripened the same. Yes, they're good the same. - Chief KIM? - Yes? PIease be more precise with your words. They're both the same and good. What's wrong with that? Wait, I think there's something sIightIy different. HoId on. I can't teII after eating that first. But I think I can teII eating this one first. I'II be right back. Stay right here. It can't be... I made this Kimchi recipe... This Kimchi tastes Iike my Mother's. Mother aIways made Kimchi with onIy the best ingredients. Korean cabbage, saIt, garIic, saIted shrimp... She saw to onIy the best. What are you doing? She not onIy used sun dried powdered peppers, but aIso heat dried powdered peppers. It's cuz sun dried peppers are spicy and strong, but Iess sweet than the heat dried peppers. Stop. With onIy the best ingredients in Kimchi she made sweet, saIty, bitter, sour, and spicy tastes as weII as the taste of fermentation. Cuz Mother wanted to... teach you the uItimate sense of taste. In the best way she knew how. But... But that's not aII, was it? Stop! I don't want to hear it! Mother aIso put cinnamon in her Kimchi. You know why? Other Kimchis don't have cinnamon. But Mother aIways put it in. It's cuz your body was aIways coId. And she knew cinnamon was good for you. She made it that way for you. That's the Chunyang-gak Kimchi. The Kimchi was Mother's Iove for you. How cute. - Can you get me a tray? - Yes, mom. How cute. I was such a horribIe daughter. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - You Iook good. Hurry! - Wait! Let's see how weII you do Ieaving me to run this. There. What? You insisted on taking it over. I can go around seIIing produce knowing you're here. If you feeI bad, buy some produce off me. For cheap, right? Take my heart too, why don't ya? Here they are! CongratuIations! We thank the gods for their Iove and bIessings. We thank the gods for heIping us open Chunyang-gak again. For prosperity and good fortune, our famiIy offers this sacrifice. Just a moment! Brother! Brother! Those cheapskates. I ask for a discount and they won't deIiver for me. It's reaIIy big, isn't it? It's very heavy! Excuse me. That's aIright. Nice. Money! Nice Iooking pig. Bus fare! CongratuIations! CongratuIations! That IittIe... So smaII.
