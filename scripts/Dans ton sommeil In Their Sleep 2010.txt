There's no reason to hurry to the last minute. - How is it? - He goes out two days before the intermediate examination. Only one hour to relax. - That doesn't seem reasonable. - Shut up! You always agree with Mom. Like moving into this hole. - We have discussed it... - Really? I wanted to stay in the city. - Don't take the tone of dad. - Where are you going? Nowhere. The living room with tiles and paint takes time. Is it smart to have a stone wall in the hallway? Relax. He'll get over it. He mustjust get used to it. Loic? IN YOUR SLEEP - Sarah, May I have a talk to you? - Now? You gave Mrs. Lacombe a too high dose. Luckily we reacted so quickly. - I don't understand. I was sure... - I'm not stupid. - I don't understand. I was sure... - I'm not stupid. I know you work a over-time. I closed my eyes for it. Look atyourself! You are unable to work. It's been a year now. You must start to live again. Go home now. Anaiis works instead of you. - Don't come back before Monday! - Okay. Are you alright? I heard the head nurse was sour. I've heard about the some sleeping pills. I can find out more, if you want. - So kind. I must go. - Okay, then. Bye. Good evening, ma'am. Police. May I see your identity card, thanks. Here you are. - Do you live nearby? - A little further away, near Bisheim. I work at Haguenau Hospital. Have you seen anything unusual tonight? A car that's been driving strange? Have you seen anything unusual tonight? A car that's been driving strange? No. I've hardly seen any cars. - What happened? - Two houses were robbed. Everyone is on vacation so the thieves have good days. Every thing's fine. You can go on. Have a nice evening. Keep your eyes open. Time 2.00. Good night, everybody. You'll manage. I'm sorry. You appeared in the dark. - Help me. - Come on! I'll help you up. Take care for the head. - Can you walk? - Help me, please. Enter. Relax. I'll take care of you. - Jump in! We'll drive. - What is it? - Drive, quick! - What happened? - Faster, faster! - I can't. Who's he? What does he want? He's crazy. What do you want? What did you do out there? Did you escape from someone? From this man? Do you know him? What happened to you? You can tell me. I saw his face. I surprised the robber in our house. I came home from a party. My parents are on holiday. He assumed that no one was home. I saw his face. Therefore, he's after me. Perhaps itwasn't him. Why did he Iet us be otherwise? He could have blocked the road. What do you think? The big bad wolf is far enough away now. You're probably right. - Where are we going? - To my home. I'll be bandaging your arm. - Where are we going? - To me. I'll be bandaging your arm. - My name is Sarah, by the way. - Mine is Arthur. - Does it hurt? - No, it's okay. You don't need to sew. Itwon't not be any scars. - I was driving too fast. - You haven't done this. What do you mean? He had a carpet knife. When I tried to escape... Why didn't you say anything? We must do something. He's dangerous. - Call the police? - We havn't got a phone. - What will you do? - It's 20km to the police... - I won't go out again. - He's crazy. He must be stopped. If we meet him? We wait until tomorrow. We spend the night here, Sarah. I'm scared. I feel safe in your house. Ok. But we'll go as soon as it gets light. Are you sure your parents don't worry? They are overseas. They don't phone before on Monday. I'm actually an adult. You'll need it. It's cold at night. I took this too. - Your T-shirt is dirty. - Thank you. Excuse the mess. My husband is handy... - Moved back to town. He never completed thejob. You Iook good in it. You can keep it if you want. - Have you Iost something? - My Iocket. The chain must be broken. It must be here. We're going to Iook in the morning. No, I've got to find it now. My parents will kill me otherwise. - They'll understand for sure. - You don't know them. - Do you want to see a photo? - Sure. You have a nice family. Why aren'tyou with? I always take the pictures. I go to bed. Wake me if you need anything. I never sleep very deep anyway. Good night, Sarah. Thanks again. Good night, Arthur. What are you doing here? Who gave you permission? Outwith you! You don't belong here. Arthur? Arthur? Stop it! - Arthur? - My ankle. Hold on to me! - We take his car. - It's too far away. - He'll get us. - This way. Fast. There he is. What's he doing? Stop it! I'll kill you! You have two messages. Hi, Michel. It's Mom. I hope itwentwell and that the weather was good. Call me and tell thatyou've come home. Suss, buy. It's Fabrice. I'm back from New York. You would have Ioved it. Especially their TV-mad son. It's like one single film. Goodbye, call me! Take it easy, little monster. Last Man to his room. So wonderfuI to be home. - Fixed the alarm? - Yes, I don't know what happened. It's been broken before. We need to buy a new one. - We should get a dog. - Yes, like Laetitia has. It's a Yorkshire terrier. - Have you called your mother? - Yes, she's concerned when we travel. - When will she? - Next weekend. She wants to meetyou. Then I know someone who gets spoiled. Send the bread! Melody, get some butter? - Have you stopped smoking? - You just have to make a decision. - He'll soon break together. - You think so? - What are you doing? - Stupid stuff, as usual. - Why so much? - You said I'd get ice cream. - Good night, honey. - Good night, Mom. - Are you coming to bed? - I come. No. No, not that. No, don't Ieave me. Ambulance... Wait! I'm here. Stay with me. Be strong. It's almost over. - I killed him. I don't understand. - You saved my life. I'd be dead without you. We need to call the police. We need to find a phone. Calm down. You need to rest. You are injured. - We take the station wagon. Can you drive? - No, I don't feel safe. - I can do it. - Do you Ieave me? Absolutely not. We stick together whatever happens. What shall we do with him? We should cover the body. It's best not to touch it. The police takes care of that. Shit. - He must have them on. - I'll stay here. OK, we can drive. Damn. Take that road. Turn right, I said. Wait here. I'll find a phone. Do you think someone is home? - What are you doing here? - You should wait in the car. - Did you get the police? - Yes, they are sending a car. - What shall we do? - They're waiting us at the station. What's up? Tell me what's going on. - Are you sure that the police will come? - Why do you ask? Tell the truth. - What do you mean? - Stop it, please. The man I killed wasn't a burglar. - What do you mean? - I'm no idiot. Why was he after you? What have you done? Did you know he had a family? Say something, damn it! Not so fast. Sarah, not so fast! Stop! Stop, Sarah! They're all dead. Do you hear me? Don't move. It's going to be fine. Take it easy. I'll get you out of the car. It doesn't Iook so serious. There are no deep wounds. I'm stuck. It's for safety's sake. Hurry up and get me out of here! You said that they were dead. Did you kill them? - The man was completely crazy. - Don't lie to me! You are right. He wasn't a burglar. - It was me who did it. - What did you say? I Iooked at a house. I thought they were on vacation. I entered and started thejob. Suddenly I fell over something. A little girl's corpse. Then I found the mother. She was also dead. Then I panicked and bowled down something. He must have heard it. Then I panicked and bowled down something. He must have heard it. When I tried to escape he appeared and had a bloody carpet knife. He had slaughtered his family. Melody? Melody? - Do you want me to believe it? - Why should I make it up? He chased me up the stairs and was about to cut himself. I ran into the kitchen. I hid behind the sink. He came in and washed the knife. I'll take you, you swine. - He would have killed us. - Why didn't you say anything? I was afraid they would arrest us. My finger prints are all over the house. I don't know. You've just lied before. I'm a boy who robs houses. I'm not a murderer. Believe me. I've no family. You are all I have. What are you doing? Don't go! What should I do? - Sooner or Iater comes a car. - You can't do this. I bandaged you. I took care of you. Do you think I would hurtyou? Sarah? You're the only one I live for. Without you, I might as well die. - What are you doing? - You don't care about me. Forgive me. It's my mistake. I won't lie to you again. Does it hurt? - Close your eyes! - What? Close your eyes! What's this? Your medallion? You found it. - I'll give it to you. - I can't accept. Yes, do it. It has always brought Iuck. Come, Iean on me! Thanks, good God. Stop! Stop! Swine! Fucking bastard! - Why didn't they stop? - Come on, just continue. We'll find a house in the end. We continue to walk. I want to give it back. I'm so tired. Come here. Sleep! I'm here. A HUGE ANIMAL FROM THE NORTH
