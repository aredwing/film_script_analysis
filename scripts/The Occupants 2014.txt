I mean... On the one hand it shows... ... nearby who are spiritually. ... They even have the same dream. And on the other side? According Well... Jesus says, ghosts do not exist. Oh, did not know that Jesus had spoken about ghosts. When someone dies, going to Heaven with God, or face the Final Judgment. Okay... So if anyone sees a ghost... - What you see is a demon. - A Demon? Demons can disguise... ... dead people, to confuse us. Do you believe that, you believe in demons? If I believe in angels.

We have a system to protect customers and us. - Is a matter of credibility. - I do not understand... reviews for trying to help a battered woman. I say, there's a reason why Center... ... is a psychologist here, is not just for customers. Moreover, it is the dream of Wade. Y Wade do you trust? - What does that mean? - It's a simple question. What does that mean? He has a dream and you have the same dream . You say he's putting ideas in my head ? - I did not say that. - And I'm foolish enough to believe that. - I did not say that. - I trusted my life to Wade, and I can not believe you asked me that. Not know Wade, you've never known. Y the only person I know who tries... ... putting ideas in my head, it's you. Please... Keep your voice down. Not think so, I came to you as a friend, and this is what you're trying to make me. Trying to help.
