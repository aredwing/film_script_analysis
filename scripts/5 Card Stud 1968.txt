Same game, five card stud. But... ...when I deal, I like to start|with all fifty-two cards. There's only one thing worse|than a crook, that's a clumsy crook. Keep the money,|just give me my horse. - You'll get your horse and a rope.|- No, hey...! - Who was shooting?|- It turned into a hanging party. - Hanging who?|- The new man, for cheating. You kick a cheat out of town,|not lynch him. What the hell are you doing? Hey, George.|Wake up and get out here. Lay still, boy. Come on. Get him up to his room. Let me know|if he needs anything, except brains. How come you didn't hear|when they dumped me there? I sleep pretty good sometimes. No questions about last night? I knew what was gonna happen,|and it did. They weren't just five men, they|were a mob. I tried to stop them. I believe you. When a gambler lets his game|wind up in a killing, pretty soon he don't have a game. You know anything about this? What about you? Was there a game downstairs|after I closed up last night? Maybe you're right at that. But I don't know, I can't swear to it. You know, I always wanted|to bust into that glass to find out what your hole card was. What do you think it was? Ace of diamond. I think you had your royal flush. So did the other man.|But he folded, so he never found out. - Where you heading?|- Anywhere, to leave this place behind. But first I got to deliver a message. - Finish packing for me?|- All right. - Morning, Mr Evers.|- Hello, Van. Stoney, Mace. How are you feeling? - Never better.|- Same. How are you? I'd say come and visit me,|but I know better. - My daughter's in, go on up.|- Thank you. What are you doing out in the sun?|You sleep all day. - I had to get up early to pack.|- Pack? You're always coming or going.|When will you decide to stay? People who stay have no place to go.|Where's your brother? If you're going to say|goodbye again, say it. - Goodbye.|- Say it properly. All right... There. That was one wore-out,|no-account kiss. How was that? Fine, but you wasted it.|I don't plan to come back this time. It wasn't wasted.|You enjoyed it. And you'll be back. Nora, you're the most foolish thing|in the world, a good woman. Why foolish? She'll push herself up against|a man till he forgets she's good. - Then she expects marriage.|- How else would she end up? With me she could end up|picking hay from her dress. Wanna bet? Don't gamble on my better instincts.|I don't have any. I just have instincts. Nick! Nick! Van wants to see you. Here I am. How do I look? From up here, just about right. You two have been fighting|each other for years. What's your reason this time? We don't need a reason. I got one. I don't like him. Do you think about|that card player much? Just all the time. Big mistake,|getting wound up with a gambler. - You gamble right along with him.|- But not for a living. What do you do for a living?|Sit around till you own the ranch? Only half of it.|The other half will go to you. Just giving you|some brotherly advice. You're not worried about me,|just about yourself. If Van was my husband,|you couldn't run him. He'd run you. No way.|I've had a gutful of that from Dad. You could get along better with Dad|if you tried. And with Van, and everybody. Why don't they try|to get along with me? - Hello, Van.|- Marshal. - Any news on the hanging?|- Nothing to hang anybody with. - I don't even know his name.|- What do you do in a case like that? You bury the man,|but keep him in mind. - You're off to Denver. Going for long?|- Depends on Denver. - Everybody in for Denver!|- Why are you going? In my business,|you gotta follow the play. So long. All right, Charley. Pair of fives. Nine. - Fives bet.|- I'll bet ten. From what I read,|you left Rincon too soon. I don't know. That gold strike|improves nothing to damn little. You'll miss the easy pickings. There's no easy pickings|till they get it out of the ground. There's no easy pickings|in Denver, either. Ma'am. - Ma.|- Fred. There's only one kind|of people I don't like: strangers. That's not a stranger,|that's progress. Sure. They tell me he's bringing in|a long mahogany bar. Real long. When the front end gets here,|the rear end will still be in St Louis. You stand to lose customers. The ones I've been getting|I'd just as soon lose. Whatever happens over there,|my place stays the same: good liquor,|a few card games and no girls. - You might lose all your customers.|- Then to hell with them. My name is Jonathan Rudd. I come from God's House,|just a little way up the street. The House is ready for use,|to hear God's word. If He's only got one, I'll be there. First services will begin|on Sunday morning at 9 a. m. You're all invited: the drunk, the sober,|the big and little sinners, the clean and the unwashed. The many who'll come to scoff|and the few who'll come to pray. You can count on me, Parson. I'm the dirtiest, drunkest,|most sinful fella the Lord ever saw. There'll be a place for you.|There was a seat for Judas. Ma'am. - Deal.|- Who's Judas? Let's get to gambling. O, come, sinner, come|there's room for thee Hark, 'tis God's home O, come and receive salvation free Hark, 'tis God's home O, come and rest, come and rest Heavy-laden guilt oppressed O, come and rest, come and rest Hark, 'tis God's home Amen Well, I see|God's House is full today. But I don't think I've started|any religious revival. You came here out of curiosity,|most of you. And your curiosity was|mainly brought on by Mr Colt. If I hadn't fired that gun, there'd be|nobody here but me and the dog. Before I came here,|there was nobody but the dog. You didn't seem to think you needed|a church, just a big doghouse. But I'm here to tell you,|you need a praying place. You want to know why? I'll tell you why.|Because you're hell-bent for hell. The Lord saw fit|to sprinkle gold here. Man and his greed|is turning Paradise into a pigsty. By day he sweats|for a pinch of yellow dust, and at night he squanders it on lust. But let's not blame our sins|on the gold. There was sin here|before it was found. Just a while ago, a man was hanged, for no reason|that ever came to light. Nor were his murderers|ever brought to book. They walk the streets|as free as you and I. But their Maker knows who they are. They can't escape from Him,|and He will punish them. Now I say to you, mend your ways. Your feet are already|on the downward path. Stop! Before the fires below devour you. Amen. May God bless you all. You plan to be the conscience|of this town? - It could use one.|- Somebody elected you? God. And Mr Colt, first name Samuel.|Sort of biblical, isn't it? Mr Colt votes a lot of people in. - He also votes a lot of them out.|- You're forgetting about God. Why not let God do his own work? I'm filling in for him|till he gets around to Rincon. Well, if either of you|needs any help... call on me. Nick Evers. Meet me here in an hour, Stoney,|and space out those drinks. Yes, ma'am. - Nora.|- Mr Hurley. The bridle broke|going home from church. - Dad patched it but I need a new one.|- I'll fix it in a jiffy. Thanks. I'll be back|after I finish my trading. Mr Hurley... What did you think|of the new preacher yesterday? A lot more than he does of this town.|Maybe the man's right. Fred Carson must be|keeping banking hours. But bankers don't leave|the front doors open. He must be in the storeroom.|I'll go see. Stay out of there!|I'm going for help. - What the hell is that?|- Looks like Stoney had an accident. That's no accident.|He's been strangled. George! Sit down. That's right out of Rincon Creek. Funny thing about gold, it doesn't look|like gold until it gets to be money. - Have you read about Rincon?|- Paper's full of it. If it ain't the strike, it's Fred Carson|being drowned in a flour barrel. - Tomorrow it'll be Stoney Burough.|- What about Stoney Burough? Somebody gave Stoney|a new string tie. Only it was made of barbed wire|and a little tight. That was some unhealthy|card party I had going. Three men dead. - Up to now.|- Up to now? It looks like someone's out to kill|every man at that party. That's a good reason to avoid Rincon,|if you planned to come back. That's what you've come|a hundred miles to tell me? - I'd have come further.|- Thanks. But the night I got thrown out|in the street, you never did wake up. - I'm woke up now.|- Stay awake. When do we go back? Back? It's you who ought to wake up. If a man's out to kill you,|don't let him pick the time. You go to Rincon,|he'll even pick the place. I won't know him|till he looks for me. You won't know him in Rincon either,|he won't wear a sign. But I will, and then he might just|make one bad move. Well, I guess a man's gotta be|a damn fool once in a while. It proves he's still alive, huh? I've seen strikes before. They eat|a town up alive. Like a snake. Before I go to Mama's, I'll clean up. From what I hear,|up the street there is the place for it. Smash your baggage, mister? - Can you find me a room?|- Mama figured you'd be back. You still got your old room. Van! Take the bag up to the room,|will you, George? I heard about Fred. It wasn't easy,|walking into that storeroom. Walking out was the hard part. And now Stoney Burough.|Everybody's edgy, even my father. He's putting up a reward|for Stoney's murderer. Like he did for Fred Carson. He won't|let me go anywhere by myself. And look what he makes me carry. Well it's a sure thing|you won't kill anybody. Unless you're that close. I'm glad you're back.|Only you didn't learn much in Denver. You forgot some. - You need a shave.|- I was about to. Not in her place!|I'd sooner shave you myself. It happens I also need a bath. I can't help you there. - I'll post the notices.|- Thanks, Al. - Hello, Van.|- Mr Evers. What do you think|of what they're doing? What who's doing? I just put up another $1,000|to find out, I don't know. Tell Nick|I'll be at Mama Malone's tonight and to bring some good|card players, he'll know who. I'll do that. - I thought this was a barber shop.|- What changed your mind? You did. Change it back.|It is a barber shop, and I own it. I could use a shave. If I got you for one bell,|what do I get for two? A barber.|Hazel, this gentleman wants a shave. Yes, Miss Langford. Ever give any shaves yourself? - About once every thousand faces.|- I guess I'm the wrong number. - Good afternoon, Miss Langford.|- Afternoon, girls. "Miscellaneous" is $20.|What's "miscellaneous"? Something you didn't ask for. - Do many people ask for it?|- It sells well. Thank you, sir. We had a seven-man poker game|that turned into a lynching party. Now three are dead. We're here to talk about|those three and us four. I care only about one of the four|live ones, and that's me. I care about the dead ones.|There never should've been a hanging. Fred Carson was my friend, and|I could even stand Stoney Burough. - Not you, though.|- You bleed too easy, Joe. The hanged man was a cheat.|Stoney was a mean drunk. Carson got paid for his hand|when he weighed anything. Anybody at this table|could be doing these killings. - You're not drunk, so you must be crazy.|- Shut up. How did you figure that? About the lynching, you could call it|a partnership in a killing. They all sit around|and start itching, these partners. - They wonder who'll crack first.|- Who would? It'd be his hide, too. He'd swap his life for all the others. If I thought anybody'd do that,|I'd kill him myself. Sure, so would you, even you,|that's what I'm talking about. Van doesn't believe any of that. He's just stirring things up,|seeing what floats to the top. I'd say Fred and Stoney|got killed by an outsider who got even for this hanging. - Got any proof of that?|- A little. Do you know what I saw|in Strangers' Corner in the cemetery? Flowers on that card cheat's grave.|Who'd do that? - Sure not me.|- Nobody but an outsider. Take it that way, then. But this outsider,|this flower-picker, how did he find out Fred and Stoney|were in the lynching party? There's only one way he could|find out. From someone who knew. How'd he guess|what outsider to go to? Maybe he did a little figuring and|tracking, like I did with the flowers. Only better. Maybe he even saw the man|put flowers on the grave. We're out to save our necks, and right now I wouldn't give|two bits for the four of them. All I know is,|I know less than when I got here. Come on, Mace. - I'm sorry you came back.|- I thought we were friends. That's why I'm sorry. Where are you going? When I was younger,|a shave lasted a lot longer. Good evening, ma'am. - This place is closed.|- Was closed. You just opened it. It's 2 a. m. and the girls have gone. Not all of them.|You answer to one bell? I'm not one of the girls, Mr Morgan. You know my name.|We meet some place before? No. I'd have remembered. You're very gallant for 2 a. m.|but I'm not one of the girls. And I don't give shaves,|especially at this hour. How about|that one face in a thousand? The last man I liked|is three years gone. That's a long time.|Want to tell me about him? What's there to say? He was a man. Well, go on. That covered it, Mr Morgan.|He was a man. - How'd you know who I was?|- I inquired. Why? - I wanted to know who you were.|- Same question. Why? - You're asking a lot of questions.|- I don't often hear the truth. I'm still waiting for an answer.|Why did you find out who I was? You're a man,|which is no recommendation. You're a gambler, which is less. You think you're the best gambler|in the world. And that's no recommendation at all. But like you said, three years|is a long time, a very long time. That's not good enough. All right. I like you. That's better. Sometimes the truth|is actions, not words. Act! That could've led to trouble|in this town. Prevented it. If I was who you're worried about,|it'd be too late. I'm Jonathan Rudd. That's my church down the street. Van Morgan.|Pretty late for a preacher, isn't it? We don't keep hours.|Nor does Mr Poe, that's where I've been. The liquor's better at Mama Malone's. I believe you're right.|But I don't go for the liquor. I go to get people away from it,|on Sunday mornings at least. Wind must've blown the door open. Hey, you!|Gimme a hand, quick. Come on. Hold him while I cut him down. It's Mace. - What do you want, Dad?|- I think I'll just have some coffee. Thank you. I think that's all I'll have, too. I hate funerals. Who'd want to kill Mace Jones? Just about anybody|who ever knew him. What would it take|to make you lose your appetite? A bellyful. Sometimes you don't seem|quite human. More like you were made|in a factory or something. If I was made by a machine|then you made it and you ran it. Stop it, both of you. Just once! Now to the sin of murder|we must add sacrilege. Since coming to this town,|I've sadly had to perform the burial of three men|who have died violently. For the hand that slew|Fred Carson and Stoney Burough, I sought the Lord's forgiveness. But for the limitless evil|of him who slew Mace Jones, I ask for limitless punishment for|he took a man's life in God's House. Let us pray, therefore, that heaven|receives the soul of Mace Jones, and that the soul of his killer|wander the darkness for ever. All men being sinful and Thou just, I pray You regard any score|against Mace Jones as even. Strike it from Thy books|and let him sleep. Amen. Amen. I didn't hear you praying,|Little George. You never will, either.|I don't believe in it. Hey, George. Van called the last meeting,|I am calling this one, while we're still alive to meet. We've paid for that hanging|three times. We've paid for it all right.|But anybody notice how? Three times|by some kind of strangling. Stoney with wire, Fred smothered,|Mace got the rope. All three of them strangled.|Which brings to mind what? The way the card cheat died. I still say|it's the work of an outsider getting even for the card cheat|and an insider telling him who did it. I don't know why it didn't hit me before|but it sure as hell hits me now. We want the man, but we've never|looked up from the card table. Well, I am looking up now. And right at me, huh? If George was going to talk,|he'd talk to the Marshal. He'd talk where it'd do the most good,|where we wouldn't find out. Why?|What good would it do George? You think George likes you, Joe?|He don't like nobody. You're the one who found that man|and told him about the card game. Now you just tell us who he is. I got no use for lynchers. They ought to get|the same thing they give out. And if I needed any killing done,|I'd do it myself. But you're right about one thing. I don't cotton to most people.|Least of all to you. Why, you...! There's a right place to stop. I don't know if Nick is right, but you'd best keep|your back to the wall. And Van had better sit|right alongside him. 'Cause if I'm wrong about George,|I just might be right about him. Everybody ought to have somebody|to say goodbye. Even you, Mace. That sermon over Mace, you take it|hard that he died in your church. My church?|I don't own it, I just look after it. That night, how long were you out|before the bell rang? I told Marshal Dana.|Why don't you ask him? I'd like to hear it from you. I went up to Poe's, as I said.|I saw you on the way back. I was gone maybe an hour. Even if you talked some, that's a long|time. Poe's is only 100 yards away. Suppose I said I like to walk at night. Suppose I said that's what I was doing.|You believe me? No reason not to. I'm glad you take my word for it,|because that's what I was doing. What kind of man murders|in a church? The kind that doesn't believe in God,|the kind that God doesn't scare. No killer is scared of God, Mr Rudd. In a church, in an alley|or behind a rock. Watch this, sweetheart. Left hand. Men talk about guns|like they're women. "She's a beauty", they say.|What's beautiful about a gun? If you were going to do a man in,|what weapon would you use? - It wouldn't be a gun.|- I'll bet it wouldn't. If he was after us, we'd be dead. "The wicked flee|where no man pursueth. " "The righteous don't flee,|they stand like a lion. " Yes, ma'am. That's the right quote.|Where'd you learn about the Bible? Where'd a preacher|learn how to shoot? Every preacher was something else|before he became a preacher. You know, I'm tired of shooting|at tin cans and bottles. We still have some cartridges left. We're not going to shoot|each other, are we? How about...? Six out of six.|Can't do better than that. - You can only do worse.|- My shooting was way off. - Way off? Six out of six?|- I was aiming at the spaces. See you in church. If every preacher was something else|first, I wonder what he was. Everybody was something|else first, even me. I don't know what you are now. You don't need that gun to find out. But maybe I need one. Sam! I'll bank the fire. Go on home. - Only one rig left? I'll take care of it.|- OK, Joe. Are you still stewing|about Mace Jones? Stewing about how I sit down|to a drink and play some cards, and how I get up and hang a man. Being drunk is a poor excuse. You weren't drinking very much,|what's your excuse? I don't lean on excuses. Whiskey or no whiskey,|you went along. - With you leading.|- That makes you a sheep. A drunk sheep maybe,|but all the same. - You were with us on that rope.|- Three men on that rope are dead. You don't give a damn|about anybody except yourself. When I was ten, eleven... ...my mother died. They laid her out in the parlour and|my old man took me in to see her. She wasn't my mother any more. She was something busted. She was something|that wouldn't run any more. My old man was crying... ...but not me. He looked up and he said,|"Where's your heart, boy?" I didn't say anything. So he slapped me|right across the mouth. I still didn't say anything. So... ...he took me out, back of the barn, and he beat the hell out of me. But he never drew a tear. I think your mother was|as dead as you. If I am dead... ...the same man killed me. Name of Sig Evers. Bring a glass for your friend.|I think he'll need it. - He won't drink with you.|- Bring the glass. Now it's reserved|for just you and me. That's right.|These are unlucky chairs. Are you afraid to sit down? You sure know where to find them. Mace Jones in the church,|Joe Hurley in the stable. Meaning that I could've killed|both of them. So could you. Trouble is,|so could any other man in town. Any one of those four guys|could've blabbed to the killer. My guess, though,|is that it's the first, Fred Carson. Why Carson? Figure like the killer. First,|you get the names of everybody. Then you kill the guy|who gave them to you. You sure want him out of the way. You're pretty good at that,|figuring like the killer. - Finish your drink.|- You have to start it to finish it. That's what this meeting's about. You're head of the Miners'|Association, so act like it. Tell the Marshal|to stop these killings. - No miner has been hurt.|- Not so far. It takes two hands to pan for gold,|and you can't shoot with your teeth. - We gotta have protection.|- All right. - I'll see what I can do.|- All right. - I'm doing what I can.|- We've had killings before. But out in the open,|and we could deal with them. This don't make sense,|and anyone can be next. When we had two dead,|I put up $2,000. Now we got four dead,|I'll put up $4,000. A thousand a head, $4,000. That's more than you make digging|gold. I don't see anyone claiming it. We're here to ask|what you're doing about it. I'm just a plain town marshal. I'm not a Pinkerton detective. I've got one deputy to help me out. And Otis and me,|we can't cover the ground. You can put up $1,000 an hour,|it won't give us more eyes and ears. We need more tin stars, not rewards. Any one of you can be sworn in.|If you find anyone else, send them in. If you make everyone a deputy,|you'll be swearing in the killer. I don't want any star.|But I am serving notice. I'm wearing my gun tied down, and|if I have to, I am going to use it. A man'd be a fool not to wear a gun|and a bigger fool to use it too fast. Someone who meant no harm could|die reaching for a chew of tobacco. You listen to Nick Evers and Rincon|will have more dead than Gettysburg. I'll tell you this: I can't control the miners much longer,|they're rounding up hotheads. Either you do something or they will,|and I can't say I blame them. Nick says wear your gun|and use it fast. Mr Morgan says wear it|and use it slow. I say don't wear it|and you won't use it at all. - Do you wear a gun?|- Yes. But I'll leave it at home|if everyone else does, too. And end up|hanging by your bell-rope? Well... I could tell you to pray, but I don't|believe the killer answers to prayer. I'll remind you of another thing:|all four dead men were wearing guns. The guns didn't save them. Can I ask you a question?|Why does a preacher put on a gun? People get funny ideas|about a preacher. That when he starts pounding a Bible|he stops being a man. That's not so. But the Book doesn't say|a man can't make himself better. So I say, leave the guns at home. Marshal. I hate to go in there. Just stay away|from the flour barrels. Are you still mad at me, Nick? Not you, the world. The world? It's flat. - Be with you quick as I can.|- Take your time, Mrs Wells. This will make beautiful underwear. The Chicago people say|it's from Switzerland. Seems a shame to cover it up. It won't be covered up|all the time, will it? I mean, you gotta hang it|on a line some time. You're making this young lady blush.|Did the ribbons and elastic come? I'll look in the storeroom,|I ain't unpacked everything yet. - Why did you think I was blushing?|- At your age I did. Someone like you, I... - You belong in the storeroom.|- Why? You were about to say women|like me always wore black lace. Yes. How else can men tell...|who they're with? They can tell long before|they get to the underwear. The last thing I expected|was to like you. Thanks. Women usually|don't like women who like men. Here it is. I'll wrap it for you in a jiffy,|Miss Langford. - I hope I'm not keeping you.|- No hurry, I'm getting an education. Hey, mister. - Say, aren't you Nick Evers?|- Yeah. I hear you said every man|should keep his gun handy. - That's right.|- I agree. Handy means handy. - Yeah.|- Come on. What's been done, huh?|Not a damn thing. - I say we put in a new marshal.|- Right. If we don't do something,|no one will. - Looking for someone?|- Making sure nobody's looking for me. Stop waving that around. Put it away. Make this town safe|and you can have it. You're making it unsafe.|I'll take the gun. Oh, no. - What would you do if I gave it back?|- I'd load it right back up again. - Try with that.|- That ain't gonna stop me. - I'll get another one.|- You got another. - Drop it or I'll throw you in jail.|- No. - You heard me. Hand it over.|- No. Stop it, you crazy fools. Get down. I don't care what side you're on,|don't take it here. All you can shoot off is your mouth. I can't cover the side|of the street from here. Van, don't! - They'll kill him.|- If you can't stand it, don't watch. I'm glad you didn't listen to yourself|and leave that home. Sounds like the war is over,|and without me, too. Every player has his way of going.|Some raise, some call... ...some just pass. I owe you something.|Say it and you got it. Come to God's House|every Sunday for a month. That's a steep price for just my life. - Miss Langford, meet...|- We've met. At the window.|We were looking at the same goods. She means you.|We were afraid you'd get shot. - Looks like I could still get shot.|- Not by me. I've been put out enough to do it. You're both lying.|You could. But you couldn't. He thinks he knows about women. You don't, do you?|Oh, about one little thing, maybe. How's Al? He isn't cold,|but he won't be warm for a while. I'm going to move him to my place. So now we've got a dead deputy|and a shot-up marshal. That ain't much law. Al knows it all right. He said for you|to get help from Denver. All right, I'll take the next stage out. But we need some tin|showing around here. Is Al up to swearing in|some deputies? - He can do that, but not much more.|- Anyone want to volunteer? We can't ask you, Mr Rudd,|but Van, we could use your help. I don't think so, a gambler with a star? Some folks think no gambler is honest,|they'd call it a stealing badge. You know why they might say that? Because men once gambled|for the clothes of Christ. Putting flowers|on your brother's grave. That's what finally|gave you away to me. Lucky the right man|happened to see me. It didn't just happen.|I made it happen. I was looking for the man|who was looking for me, you. Somebody who'd talk.|You saved me a long hunt. What were you doing|in that street this afternoon? You're not here to stop killing,|but to kill. I'm particular about who gets killed. It would've been odd,|you getting yours out there today. All right, who's next? George, bartender at Mama Malone's. - He was in the card game?|- It was after hours, why not? - He was in the hanging party?|- Right up front. Bartender George, that makes five. You make six,|my brother makes seven. How many more were in that game? - Just one.|- And when do I get that name? - After you settle with George.|- I see. One at a time all the way, that's it? That's it. This name you're keeping back.|Why save him for last? He led the hanging. When I tried to stop him,|he used a gun butt on me. He's last because I want him to die|once for every man in that game, and once for himself. Besides,|he'll be the toughest to take out. Wouldn't like you hurt|before your job is done. I killed those men|because they killed my brother. What about you?|Why did you want them dead? Because they were alive|and I didn't want to be dead. Any one of them could've found you. They could be doing to me|what I'm doing to them. I see. "Do unto others. " I've got just one rule: me first, nobody second. Name me somebody|who don't feel that way. You had to do it,|if you're to keep up with Poe. They say competition's the life|of trade. It'll be the death of me. Don't complain,|it's closing time and we're still full. You'd better turn in so you can|clean up this mess in the morning. That is if you can sleep|for the racket. I was born in a bass drum|and raised in a brass horn. George! Get up! Get out here|and clean up this sinkhole! Oh, my God! Pete, get someone|from the Marshal's office, quick. - What for?|- Just get him. George's room. Stand you for a cup of coffee. - What's the matter?|- It's George. I found him dead when|I opened up this morning. - Pete, will you get Dr Cooper?|- Yes, sir. Somebody shot a hole|right through George's gut. Must've been from close up.|There's powder burns on his vest. What bastard would do|a thing like that? He was a mean one. Who'd shoot a man that|was begging for his life? He was no beggar. He wouldn't have|said "please" to live 1,000 years. It sure looks like he's begging,|with his hands like that. Or maybe praying,|which comes to the same. Praying? Not George. The man they dug that one for|ought to be buried over there. - In Strangers' Corner.|- George was no stranger to you. - He sure was a strange colour.|- We all look alike to the worms. I took you for a fool.|I made a mistake. Big mistake. Forty-five calibre. There had to be trouble|before I got the last name. Sure, once you got it,|you'd kill me before you killed him. - So instead you're going to kill me.|- It's bite or get bit, Reverend. And I'm biting. There's one thing you forgot.|Who'll take care of the last man? - Van Morgan will be my pleasure.|- Van Morgan. I've had to believe you. But I don't|believe you tried to stop that hanging. Stop it? Hell, I led it,|just like I've been leading you. Any last wish?|Would you like a smoke? Would you like to say a prayer? I would like to pray.|Not for myself, for my brother. Go ahead. If you can find one|to fit that card cheat. Oh... but first, get rid of the gun. Unknown,|found hanged March 1, 1880. It said that in the papers, too.|Did you know that? Get praying. This man was lynched in Rincon,|Colorado, that's what it said. - Then it said what he looked like.|- He looked like every second man. Height, weight, colour of eyes, hair. That's not what brought me|here, though. Marshall Dana wrote something else. Old knife scar, right shoulder.|That made it Frankie Red. Well, Frankie. I guess they didn't|bury you with any gospel. I'll try to make it up to you now.|This might be good for you, too. Oh, come on,|Frankie's waiting for you in hell. I just had a thought. When they find you, my old man|will offer another thousand. Only this time it'll be for me. - Here it is.|- Come on. Something for you... from the Book. "'Vengeance is mine,'|sayeth the Lord. " But this day I am the Lord,|and I repay. I sure wouldn't want your job. I heard about George, Van. I'm sorry. But we've got two US marshals coming|in a week. Anything else happen? I've got some real bad news|for you, Mr Evers. The worst. But I don't like to tell you|on a street corner. I think you just told me, it's... - It's Nick, isn't it?|- He was shot. - Nick's dead?|- Yes, honey. - Where is he?|- Over at Doc's house. Come on, honey. I talked to Mr Evers|before he went home. He'd like you at his son's funeral. - I'll see him at the graveyard.|- The burial's gonna be at the ranch. I'm taking the casket out there now,|the family asked me to. If you'd like to ride along with me,|you're welcome. I'll go by myself later on.|Catch up with you, maybe. One for you, Nick. Stoney. Tinhorn. Carson, Mace, Hurley. And me. I hope you win. Can't miss.|I'm playing with six dead men. Where are you going? For a horseback ride.|Wanna do me a favour, Mama? Depends. If I'm not back by dark,|will you flip that last chair up? - What if you do get back?|- We'll sit down and play some cards. About time. If a man don't work,|he ain't respectable. - Mr Rudd.|- Mr Morgan. Last time I came to the Evers ranch,|I thought Nick was a lucky man. "For every beast of the forest|is mine. " You've preached a lot of funerals|lately. Got anything new? The funeral's for the living. I'll say that he was a good son|and brother, a loyal friend and a good citizen. - Won't you gag on all that?|- Why should I? I'm a gambler, and I don't always|bank on my cards or I'd be broke. Like your opponents. Every once in a while,|something comes out of the air, and says something in your ear. - An hour ago it landed.|- What did it say? It said, "This is it, play it. " Well, then, play it. You're the killer of Nick Evers|and all the rest. Make that executioner,|of the criminals who killed my brother. They hanged him for just|some fast work with some cards. George wasn't in the game. Nick Evers swore|he held that rope and so did you. George wasn't there,|and neither was I. So Nick was the one who talked. Looking back, he was due to go bad.|I thought he was too smart to get killed. Nobody's too smart for that,|not even you. And not even you, Mr Rudd. You left George for dead, but he lived|to say something with his hands. It didn't come to me till you turned|that last chair over at the card table. George wasn't praying,|he wasn't begging. He was trying to show|who killed him, a man who prayed. You won't be reading over Nick|'cause I'm taking you in. There'll be no trouble,|Mr Morgan. But... ...if you don't mind, first I'd like|to read the rest of that psalm... ...about the thousand hills. Well, read.|Or can't you read upside down? If that's a Bible, read it.|If not, drop it. Mr Rudd's the man we've been|looking for, Mr Evers, the killer. Of Nick, too? But why? I don't know about the others, but|I think Nick got onto him like I did. I won't see your father again,|so would you say "so long" for me? I will, Van. But I don't think|he'll ever get over Nick. - You'd better, though.|- I'll try. But it's not like a bullet.|A bullet kills you or you heal up. - It's the first time you didn't say it.|- Say what? That I'd be back. That's right. Do you know why? 'Cause you don't give a damn|any more. I do. But this is the first time|I haven't been sure you'll be back. Cards, dice and anything else,|you're never sure of it. One thing is:|I give a damn about you. A big damn. Strange about Rudd.|He could've kept this place going. So what was he|before he was a preacher? Maybe he always was a preacher. Lily, I'll see you in Denver|in about a week, you know where. If I'm not coming,|I'll send you a four-flush. Why must you be|the first to say goodbye? I don't know if this is goodbye. I'm used to the truth from you,|a yes or a no. This time the truth is maybe. Give me a kiss.|That'll last me a week. - What if you don't show up?|- That'll mean the kiss wore off. If you're not made of iron,|I'll see you in Denver. You sure didn't feel like iron.
