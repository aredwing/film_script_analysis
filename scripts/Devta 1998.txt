Now I can openly tell you to pack your bag. What? - I'm transferred to Mumbai. Welcome, uncle Jagatpal. Welcome! Just a minute! Just a minute! You, guard- Just a minute! Uncle, my father's name is Bajrang Panda. And this name itself is a biggest security. You're insulting us by bringing your security here. You please stay near the car. Yes, please go and take care of the car. Somebody might not fix a bomb with it. - Uncle. Why do you get angry, my nephew? Nowadays it has become a fashion to fix a bomb. That's why I'm telling you. Brother-in-law, look who has come. Leader! Hey Jagatpall My friend. My buddy. How are you, brother? I'm fine. - No, you're not. You're not fine. Please sit down. - Please" Sit down, Jaggu. Tell me how do I serve you? Brother Bajrang - Brother-in-law! Is there any use of servicing? His government is no more in the power. That doesn't mean he has lost his respect. He's my friend. We're old friends. I've come to you on the basis of the same, Bajju. I want 100 million urgently. - Why? Is there any sale of MLA? - Shut up, idiot. Yes, I'm. - Look, Bajju. If I failed to prove my majority" within 10 days. I might loose the position. Apposition party's Baxi will make the government. So you must give me 100 million in any circumstances. It's difficult. - Difficult? For you? Why? Do we have a printing machine to print the notes? You've taken millions from us even before. What about those? Are they lost? Why? When I was in power, you've made money by.. Illegal ways. Had you made it to use after dancers? Don't talk wrong things, Jagatpal. If Bajrang Pandey has made money in your power.. Then it wasn't for his own self. My men and I've made efforts to make you win.. At the stake of our lives. At the time of election I had seen people spitting" ...at your poster. Even after that you've become a minister. It was only because of me. Is that clear? And you.. this ownership of this big estate ...is also because of me. Look, Bajju. I'm very much disturbed at this time. I'm in need of money. I won't give you. You've talked about a dancer? Now I'll spend it after dancer but will.. ...never give it to the broker like you. You were the broker, you rascall - Aye! No, nephews. Nol What are you doing? And you also. Please talk with smile and love. Why are you disclosing each othes secret? You've said a lot, Jagatpal. A lot. Till now I've just spoken, Bajrang Pandey. Let me come in the power. I'll disclose everything about-. ...your illegal money and will bring you on footpath. Remember, I'm Jagatpal. And I'll also speak up against you in the interview. And make you clean the drainage. Remember, I'm Bajrang Pandey. Let it be.. - Move, uncle! - No. No! Jagatpal, you've given me a good reward of our friendship. You've made a line on my heart. From today onwards, I'll be at one side.. And you'd be at the other side. Go away, Jagatpal. Just go away. Then don't say that I've attacked on my friend.. ...who was my guest, too. Go! Go away! If you've felt so bad with his behaviour". Then why did you stop us? Dad, by now his last rituals would have been performed. Brother-in-law, I don't understand something. That the person who has always got the position by.. ...our grace today you accepted defeat from him? If I had accepted defeat then this man name" Bajrang Pandey would be somewhere in some slum.. Or would have gone back to his native place. Find Ballu Tiger. And tell him I want to meet him. What's the matter, constable? Why this file.. ...Is having so much of dust? This is Ballu tiger's file, sir. - What do you mean? Sir, the previous officer had made this file. After him nobody opened this file. It didn't open or nobody dared to open her? You go and call inspector Kulkarni. Sir he's sick and is on leave. Then tell inspector Das to come and meet me. Sir, he's also on leave. He said.. ...he had to consult a dentist. Dentistl That means inspector Wagle.. Also must be on leave. - Yes, sir. He must have got the diarrhea. How do you know, sir? It's very simple. Because Ballu tiger's file is going to get open. That's why our police officers have got sick. That's the reason our system is sick. You please go and do your work. - Ok, sir. Let me see who's that tiger whose roaring can make.. The police officers sick. Sirl - Salute, sir! Salute, Ballu sir! - Salute! Salute, Ballu sir! Salute sirl Ballu tiger. Have you attached the word tiger to your name" to scare people? No, sir. My master has given me this name. And about scaring people then according to the public.. Tiger is not a police's uniform.. That can be worn to scare people. What do you think? We've put on this uniform to dominate people? You didn't hear me properly. Public say this. - I have called you here to warn you. Better step back from crime from today onwards. Henceforth, if any of your complaint reaches to me.. ...then remember. I've hunted many terrifying wild animals. Then what are you doing in the human area? Take your transfer jungle. I've come to the jungle, tiger. Then be alert. This jungle is very dangerous. Many officers have disappeared in this jungle" and many escaped with the terror. This is what public says. At every places where I did my duty" ...do you know what's public's opinion about me there? ACP Rakesh not only cuts off the tree of crime" ...but also makes the land barren where such trees grow. You can go. And listen! I don't want any more complain against you. Outl Salute! - Ballu tiger has come. - Ballu has come. C'mon, let's go. Ballu tiger, why are you hitting us? What's our fault?

Anticipatory bail. The way you always carry the handcuffs with you.. Same way Ballu Tiger carry this paper with him. This is what public says. This is not a paper. It's a lollypop. It's given to the loafers like you sitting in the lap of politics. But the day you come in my grip.. ...I'll make your condition so worst that doctor will be" ...perplexed from when to start treating your wounds. The wounds that you give doctor must be bandaging it with white strips. But after the wounds that I give.. Entire body need to be covered with the shroud. This is what public says. Brother-in-law, his heart might not fail watching so many rupees together and you'd be hanged onto noose. What noose? If this was done three years before" ...Baxi would have made the government and not Jagatpal. Anyway, it's never late then before. Go and bribe all those you want. And make them your parrot. I mean your government. Now his full and final end will be seen. He'll come to the footpath and not we. Definitely. - But! But, Mr. Baxi, mind one thing very clearly. Don't change yourself when the power is in your hand. Otherwise the result will be very bad. Because in your politics, if you have enmity with others" ...you snatch away his position. But in our business, if we have enmity with others" ...we directly send him to the tomb. Nol This is not a bag.. ...This is sticking material. It'll tightly stick Bajrang and me. I'll work like a TV. And Bajrang will have its remote control. Only my face will appear on screen. But Bajrang only will change the channel. Am I right, Bajrang? It's tobacco. Take care. Are you alright? Ok then. I'll take your leave. - Ok. Brother Ballu, welcome! Welcomel My brother in law's piece of heart, his life. Everything of him. Welcome! Welcome! It's enough now. Let's come to the point.

"Whether it's a glass or heart.." "Whether it's a glass or heart.." "It always breaks.." Jagatpal, you didn't even gave such a great party ...even after being a minister. Have you captured all the MLA's together? What are you saying? I'm not such a big politician. You're right. All these things become a joke.. ...for everybody who reaches this stage. Jagatpal, I've promised to invest my finance. You don't turn back from your promise. Speak slowly, Mr. Jayant. Take care that you only.. Stumble under the effect of intoxication and not stammer. Because I've yet not obtained the power. God knows who's aiming from where to make me fell down. You're right. Mr. Jagatpal, you were the minister of this city once. Any big personality can bend at you. How can anybody challenge you? Mr. Modi, this is politics. And politics is like chess. Your attention is diverted slightly and" Come out! I don't think I need to tell you that it's crime" ...to drive the car fast and break the signal. But you enjoy breaking the Law, don't you? Am I right? You enjoy, don't you? So, Tiger, did you enjoy? No. Even I didn't enjoy. Because I'm habitual to break" ...criminal's bones and not the cars. By the way, don't drive so fast. If you'd be killed in the road accident then what will.. Happen with the government's bullet'? One more thing Hello! ACP Rakesh here. Hello, sir. Somebody shot Jagatpal. - When? Few moments before. - In which hospital he's? In Gandhi hospital. - 0k.

Today sir's mood is exactly ...like that of anybody at his first night. He wishes to tell you but can't speak up. You're right, Banne Khanl I'm noticing him from yesterday night.

Otherwise I'll drag your tongue from the phone.. Just how you drag the chain to flush in the toilet. Now c'mon, give the phone to your rascal brother in law. C'monl - Ok, fine. Hold it. Wait a minute. I'll call him now. Rascal brother-in-law! Rascal brother-in-Iawl What rubbish is this? You bloody swine! I'm not saying this. Somebody from the other end is calling you rascal.

Don't call me rascal You'll have to pay heavy stroll. Ask anybody. Because we never give dowry when we marry our sister. Instead we take it. You will become a beggar. Now you listen to me. I had gone to JagatpaPs house" with the intention of thievery. I had got a tip that he has lots of illegal money in his house. I didn't find any cash over there but have got a dairy. And Jagatpal has clearly mentioned in that diary" that if he's murdered any day then Bajrang will.. ...be responsible for his death. Who's speaking? - Stupid, if not any blackmailen. Then does any decent man has time to scare ...a terrifying snake like you? Now let's come to the point. Pay me 5 million and take away your torn diary.

Betel nut is cut with betel cracker and not with the teeth. This is ACP and this is Ballu tiger. Hello! - Hello, sister-in-lawl inspector Shrikant here-. You please come to the ...Wadia hospital as early as possible. Why? What happened? Nothing, sister-in-lawl ACP sir is injured.. With a small accident. - I'm just coming.

Please answer to our question. An important news. Somebody tried to assassinate ...ACP Rakesh Mehra today. He's seriously injured. He's admitted to the wadia hospital. Police is in search of the assassin. His wife is also unable to give any information" about this incident. Look, I can't give any answer to your questions.. ...till I don't meet my husband. Please" please Ballul How come this glass is broken? It slipped from my hand and broken. You must pick up the broken glasses immediately. It's not good to keep them as it is. I'm carrying a broken heart from many years. Everything is fine. Glass and heart are two different things. Yes, the difference is only one. That heart beats. Whereas both can break. That's what public say. Ballu, nobody is my close friend in this world. But I can see how sad this friend's heart is. I don't have any right to ask but it's about my friend. So, I think it's my duty to know. Who gave this pain to you? Was he somebody very close to you? Yes! Very close. But suddenly I realised that it was dream. I tried a lot to forget her. To take her off from my heart. But that voice, that fragrance, that smile" "resided in my heart in such a way that". ...I feel I had recently met her. "This young and beautiful girl.." "..is here with her beloved." "..she's talking with him and gave us some excuse." "Make me your drape and cover your body, my dear." "Make me your drape and cover your body, my dear." "I'm the sealed bottle of intoxication.' "And you're the habitual drunker." "You're the queen and I'm your king." "Open the door to your heart." "I'm a young fan of yours." "Make me your drape and cover your body, my dear." "This young and beautiful girl.." "Your style has some magic." "It really has some magic.." "Your heart is filled with love for me." "It's the right place for me." "Don't go far. Come close to me." "Let's declare our love." "The season is also in our favour." "Make me your drape and cover your body, my dear." "I'm the sealed bottle of intoxication.' "And you're the habitual drunker." "This young and beautiful girl.." "Make me the flute of your lips." "Make me the flute.." "I'll reside you in my heart." "I'll reside you in my heart." "Marry me and take rne with you." "My youth might not pass away." "Make me your drape and cover your body, my dear." "I'm the sealed bottle of intoxication.' "And you're the habitual drunker." "You're the queen and I'm your king." "Open the door to your heart." "I'm a young fan of yours." "Make me your drape and cover your body, my dear." "I'm the sealed bottle of intoxication.' "And you're the habitual drunker." From where you're coming? When you know it. Why do you asking me? How dare you argue with your father? This is my decision, mother. And I've declared it in the entire village. That I love Balram and I'll marry him only. This is your decision. But now listen to my decision. If you won't stop flirting with that tourist guide I'll kill you. What's lacking in Balram? - Don't shout. Don't take his name in this house and create any chaos. Start preparing to leave this village. Now we won't stay here. We'll go to her maternal uncle's place" I won't marry anybody else other than Balram. You'll marry the boy of my choice only. And he's not any ordinary person. He's a police officer. - Whomsoever he may be. It doesn't make any difference to me. I've told you about my decision. Now I'll see who tries to stop me. Worthless-l Shameless! What are you talking? You're a girl. Behave like a girl. Shameless! Let's go inside. Don't come out. How dare you argue with your parents'? Sir, this is the best place I've shown you till now. Look at the view of this place. Very good! You build a five star hotel here.. And then see how it gives you business. What's the requirement of tourists? Good air, good place and good food. That's it. You've come here for the first time, don't you? - Yes. Very first time. I'm driving taxi here from last 15 years. It's a very long time. And the way we travelled just now.. ...Is the beautiful way. Transportation for the customers" ...is very easy on this way. - Yes. And.. - Ayel Enough now. Let us speak something. Very sorry, sir. - Dad, let's finalise this place. Yes, brother-in-law, it's a best place for hotel. Nobody can escape from here without paying. Ask rne why? See, there's big valley around everywhere. I'm not going to build a lodge here but five star Hotel. Stupidl Wow! It sounds so sweet. It seems there are many parrots here. Dad, we'll build our hotel here only. Brother-in-law, listen to me. Drop him here only. He'll keep playing with the parrots here" and your tension will be relived. Sirl Many people wishes to buy such places. So before anybody make the final deal" ...you better buy it and make a hotel. I'm telling you it'll give you big business. Whenever the customer will open the window.. ...he'll see only greenery everywhere. Very green. sirl Very flower. Very.. No, Balram, don't kill him. I want him alive. Alive! Balram, keep this money. It's 50000. For what, sir? - For saving my life. No, sir. How can anybody charge for saving life? It's a virtuous task. It's a great work. Wowl Brother-in-law, it's so strange. Over here people do not even charge And over there, in the city, they charge millions.. And trillions to murder anybody. I'm happy with you and giving this money to you. Please keep it. It'll be useful to you. No, sirl Balram has lots of faith on his hands. I just want to earn money by hard work. My today's fee is rupees 350. And driver's charge is 100. So total rupees 450. - Give him. - Yes. 450. Yes, here. Sir, shall I tell you something? - Yes. We get this life after many difficulties. Don't drink and waste your life. He's innocent. Very innocent. Just like a parrot. But he's honest. - That's why he's driving taxi. Otherwise he'd be at brother in law's place. Nol I mean to say he's not greedy. Now see, he refused to take 50000 rupees. Anybody at his place would have" grabbed this money like a dog. He's not a dog. He's a tiger. A tiger. Very good morning, sir. Balram guide is present at your service. Please come, Balram. Have some drink. Thank you, sir! My work is my intoxication. Only work. We must have the intoxication of some thing in life. Otherwise, life becomes meaningless. Sir, come with me. I'll show you such things" ...on this hill station thaL. ...you'll experience spring in your meaningless life. Please comel Balraml Balraml Devika, you and here? - I wish to marry you now. Right now. - Very good! But why so early? Otherwise it'll be too late. Papa has selected a boy for me in city. He wish me to marry him. No, Devika. I won't let that happen. It is going to happen. I've escaped from home. I wish to marry you. If you won't marry me I'll commit suicide. Remember this. - No! We'll definitely get married. Just a minute! Sir, I'll be back in a moment. I've an urgent work. - Ok. Please comel Mr. Pradhanl Mr. Pradhanl You? How dare you? Leave her hand. I said leave it. I didn't hold her hand to release it. Now listen to us. I respect you a lot. Very much! We love each other a lot. And you very well know it. Don't marry her with somebody else.. And do this injustice with us. This is our request to you. If we wish, we could have eloped.. And get married secretly. But this is not good. It's very bad. I'll marry her and respectfully take her to my house.. ...In short time. Till then Devika will be my deposit with you in this house. If you hand over her to somebody else ...I'll definitely die but before that I'll bloodshed here. I had come to tell you the same. Good luck! Go! Sorry sirl Let's go. Otherwise it'll be duck and you won't enjoy visiting. I'm waiting for the dusk, Balram. Please have a seat. - What? Please sit downl Keep this money. - So many rupees? Keep it my friend. Sir, my fee is only 200 rupees. This is much more. Very much. This is nothing compared to the thing that I saw with you. I didn't get you, sir. I'm talking about the girl who came to see you just now. I'm really impressed with her beauty. What an intoxicating youth. Send her to me for one night. Somebody help mel He will kill me. Devikal Devikal What happened? What happened? Why are you breathing so heavily? Balram has done a murder. - Murder? Whose? A businessman from Mumbai had come here. He murdered him. Nol Balram can't murder anybody. Balram only did this murder. He was trying to escape with that man's money. And it was 20000. And when that man tried to shout. Balram pierced an arrow in his stomach. Police has arrested him. - No! Balram can't do this. Balram is not like that. He's not like that. My child, Such people have no self-respect or honesty. That's why I was stopping you. But you were so madly in love with him that you considered" ...me your enemy. Good that his real form is visible to all. Nothing is visible. This is wrong. Balram is not like that. He's not like that. - Devika! Were you trying to steal that sir's money? No, sir. It's wrong. Even this is wrong that you murdered that sir? I didn't murder anybody. I'll see how long you won't confess. Keep beating his till he won't confess. I'll just come. Is everything fine? - Yes. It's alright. Brother-in-law, Ballul - Sir, you? Balram, I've paid your bail. Sir, I didn't murder anybody. I know, Balram. I very well know. The person who saves others life can't kill anybody. Police may make mistake in knowing you.. But not this Bajrang Pandey. I can recognise the person from its first appearance. Balram, if we knew about this before.. ...we'd not have taken 8 days. We'd have freed you in 2 minutes. Very early. Please comel - No, sir. I wish to meet Devika first. 0k, fine. Comel - Let's go. These people.. - They went to the city. When? - Five days before. I head that her uncle had selected a boy for her. And by now she must have married. - No. Then what do you expect? She'd have waited for you? That Balram will release from jail and then marry her? Now forget her. And let her spend a happy life. Tears doesn't look good in tiger's eyes. If I knew that Devika has IefL. ...I'd not have let you pay my bail. I'd have hanged onto noose with the charge of murder. What's the use of my life? What's left for me in this world now? Come with me. I'll take you to my new world. Please come. Even today that scene is very clear in front of my eyes. I thought I had permannetly locked that poor.. Hello! - Hello, is it Ballu Tiger? I'm Lallan, Bajrang Pandey's brother in law. What? Thank you! I've good news, Ballul Brother in law has got the bail.. And is back to home. It's god's grace. Otherwise ACP had decided to break" ...my brother in law's leg and hand and make him a beggar. But he doesn't know that the time has gone.. ...when brother in law used to beg. What rubbish, uncle? - Have you become a parrot? You're eating chilli and calling me parrot? Brother-in-lawl Here's the phone. Hellol Wonderful, Ballul Wonderful! What a job you've done. That's why I've named you tiger. If you were here I'd have kissed you. Here" Listen, Ballu, you had done your job perfectly. But ACP is very lucky. He's still not dead. But you don't worry. He'll die. Very soon he'll die. Listen, Ballul I've kidnapped the doctor's family who's treating" ...ACP in the hospital. Now he'll do everything that I wish. Where your bullet failed, poison of.. Doctor's injection will definitely succeed. What are you doing? If I won't kill him they will kill my family. Nothing will happen to your family. But if anything will happen to him I'll fire the entire hospital. You go home. You'll get your family there. It's my responsibility. Take it awayl Take it away. Won't you drink today? - Even tomorrow I won't drink. I was drinking to forget my pain. But the happiness I've got today ...I don't want to forget it by drinking. Madhul These hands have done many murders. And in return of every murder, I've got lots of money. But I never got so much of happiness that we get". ...by saving somebody's life. That's what Ballu says and not public. Ballu, you're a very strange personality. One needs to have heart and feeling to know you. I'm happy that I've known you. And suddenly I felt that I'm in love with you. "I'm completely injured from everywhere." "Both of my eyes bend down bashfully." "I'm eager to meet my beloved. "I'm a broken star. I'm a wanderer." "I'm a broken star. I'm a wanderer." "My heart is crazy. Sorrow is my treasure." "My destiny has cheated with me." "I'm a broken star. I'm a wanderer." "I'm a broken star. I'm a wanderer." "if I knew that falling in love.. Brings only pain to our part." "I'd have made a propaganda." "..to aware people not to fall in love." "I'll spend my life at your feet.' "My heart only wishes to be helpful to you by any means." "How will my destiny be changed?" "This chain of destiny has never broken.." "..and will never break." "I've become so helpless. I'm completely scattered. "I'm totally helpless at present." "I'm a broken star. I'm a wanderer." "I'm a broken star. I'm a wanderer." "if you really love somebody.." "..love so much. "That you never separate in life.." "..also not after the death." "I'll offer my life for you one day." "I'll gather the tears of your eyes in my drape.' "How will anybody share the loneliness of my heart?" "I'd only one happiness in life.." "..but it couldn't stay with me for long.' "I'm just living for the sake of living.' "Those days of my life has gone." "I've lost my heart." "I'm a broken star. I'm a wanderer." "I'm a broken star. I'm a wanderer." Why did you do this, Ballu. You shot ACP on my instruction. And then went to the hospital to save him? You released doctor's family and send them back? And saved that ACP's life. Why did you do this? C'mon, tell me. Money? Did you lack money? You don't know how much you've hurt rne by doing this. You've really given me shock. I want to know the reason of this behaviour. C'mon, tell me. I've done many murders on your instructions. But never asked you the reason. Today when I saved one. Don't ask me the reason. But why did you save him? Why? Had his wife handed over herself to you? Nol No, Ballul Ballul No! Your father has supported me. That's why I'm leaving you. Otherwise I'd have killed you. This has happened for the first time. He has broken from somewhere. There must be some reason behind this. There has to be. Thank you, sir. I'm happy to know that you're getting discharge today. Rakesh, you've given the statement that you've never ...seen the person who tried to assassin you. Is it true? Yes, sir. It's true. - Think over it again. Your might recollect something. I'm sorry that I couldn't see his face. Anyway! All the best! - Thank you, sir-. What's the matter, Devika? Why do you seem so upset? I'm perfectly fine now. Rakesh, please take your transfer from this city. I don't wish to live here anymore. This city is unlucky for us. - I know, Devika. You're very much worried about me. But don't make it your weakness. Will you like when people will taunt you.. That ACP Mehra left the city" because of the fear of his death? Will you be able to listen to people's taunt? Devi, I won't give this chance to anybody. This is just a beginning. I told commissioner that I didn't see that person. But I had lied to him. I very well know.. The person who attacked on me. This is his file. You take proud of your strength, don't you? People call you tiger, don't they? Today you and I both are alone. C'mon, hit me. Hit me, tiger. Hit mel You won't get a good chance than this, Tiger. C'mon, hit me. Hit me. What's wrong with this tiger today? How come he has become a rat? Are you a big goon? C'mon, hit mel Hit mel If I wish I could kill you in a momenL. With the name of police encounter. Nobody will come to save you. Nobody. Tell me on whose instruction you do these murders? Municipality people will drag away" ...your dead body like a dog. You people are like the bullets. Somebody else triggers them. I want those hands that make use of you people. And I'll definitely cut those hands. This is my promise to you. C'mon. Till you were working on m y instruction you were ...a very brave person, Ballu. So brave that you also shot ACP on my instruction. But the day you came to know that ACP is the husband" ...of the same girl whom you used to love. Your head bent there. That ACP beat you so much. Forget about beating him in return" but you didn't even raise your eyes. My Ballu is affected with evil eyes. This is not my Ballu. This is not my Ballu. Lallan, come here. See, what I've brought for you, Ballu. Sari, flower, bangle, anklet and earrings. All this is for you. Put it on and change your gender. This is called the magic of love. All this has happened because of that girl. You could neither kill that policeman" ...nor could you raise your hand at me. And now you also don't have any place" ...for Bajrang Pandey in your heart. Have you forgotten all my obligations? Because of whom? Because of that stupid girl? Who ditched you and married somebody else? Ballu, now my enmity with that policeman. Has increased more. Do you know why? Because he has snatched away my Ballu from me. He'll die. He'll meet a terrifying death. Nothing will happen to him. Nothing. I won't let him die. - You won't let him die.. And we won't let him remain alive. Henceforth this war will be between you and me. Let's see. Let's see who wins. Hellol Hellol Ballu here. Devika, please don't hang up. By swear of me. - Why did you call up here? To let rne know that one day you'd make me widow? Devika, please don't misunderstand me. What else I should consider you if not wrong? I didn't know that ACP Mehra is your husband. I want to meet you. - But I don't want to see your face. 0k, fine. I won't come into picture. I'll turn back and talk with you. But please come and meet me once. Why should I meet you? Will you clarify yourself? Will you prove your innocence? Right? That time has passed now. Now I just want to meet you for your husband's life. I want to tell you something. I've sent a man to your house. Please come with him. This is my request to you. Ballul Today I've cooked this food. Please have it. Why have you called me here? Devika, tell your husband to take transfer from here. Why? - Because his life is at risk. Who will kill him? You? Only because I didn't marry you? No, Devikal - Then why did you try to kill him? And now you're threatening me.. Stating that his life is at risk? And we should leave this city because of you? He's not so cowardly. He knows to face the challenge. He doesn't know to attack from back. And that's why I'm proud of my husband. He's my god. God! If your husband is god for you then this man" ...is also not any less than a godl This nuptial symbols that you're wearing today ...is because of this god. He did tried to kill your husband. But the moment he came to know that he's your husband" ...he saved your husband's life at the stack of his own. And he developed enmity with his own people. No, Madhu. Enough. Let me say, Ballu. You're mistaking him. That he wants to take revenge of your disloyalty. If he really had to take revenge ...he wouldn't have spent so many years. He could have done this long before. That murder was an accident, Devika. He came to your house after releasing from jail. But your father had taken you long away from him. That day he cried a lot, Devika. If he wished he could have found you. But he kept quiet and forgot you to save you from infamy. This godly husband you've got today is because of.. ...his prayers. But his own life has become a hell. You left from his life and circumstances made ...a soft-hearted Balram, a terrible Ballu Tiger. I request you, Devika. Please take your husband's transfer from this city. Bajrang Pandey has left many people lo kill him. I've saved him today. But tomorrow" I'm proud of you, Devika. I've been cheated. - Cheated? I can never forget this cheat and deceit taken place with me. My duty is my first love, Devika. Department didn't do this right with me. Department? - Yes. Look at this transfer order. For the first time in my life.. ...I'll have to go from the city without getting success. This order is a biggest spot on my career. I've faces many dangerous tasks in life.. ...I was never sacred of any big storm. Today I'll have to bend at this small piece of paper. But I very well know who's doing all this. I know who's doing all this. Dear Bajrangi, I have done my work. Greeting, Bajrangi Greeting! I've brought good news. You'd be happy to hear it. Your biggest enemy ACP Mehra" ...is transferred from the city. What's this? What's the matter, Bajrang? Why do you need to take that ACP's name? His name reminds brother in law of his torture in the jail. Am I right, brother-in-law? - Aye! I won't let him leave this city so easily. He'll be transferred. But not in some city. Directly to the heaven. I also know that ACP's death is final. But have you thought of your tiger" that has escaped from your cage? It's not a great deal. We'll cage him again. And Jagatpal murder case file is not yet closed. Police is in search of the murderer. I just have to make one call. Only one. You can make two calls. Brother-in-law, what if we kill the tiger on the way" ...when he was being taken to the court? When we've call off the relations" what's wrong if we kill him? What do you say? For the first time in your life.. ...you've said something sensible. Thank you, brother-in-lawl That means I can dream of your position after your death. I'll bring syrup for him. - Stupid! Idiot! Why these sweets? Today is my birthday. - Oh, happy birthday. - Thank you! Take this. You also sweeten your mouth. Only best wishes? You can also give her some gift. What do you want? You'll get anything that you ask for. Really? I hope you won't deny. - Try asking me. Promise? - Promise. Ballu tiger, you're under arrest. - Reason? Under the blame of Mr. Jagatpal's murder. Rakeshl Bajrang, you? - Yes, It's me. I've got the news that you're leaving from this city. How can you go like that? Did you forget? I had promised you that. ...I wouldn't sleep till I decide something about you. I love you a lot. If you'd left I won't like in this city. Seel We've come to take you away with respect. This is not the way towards police station. Who's going to the police station? Today Bajrang Pandey will be relieved.. ...from both his enemies. What do you mean? - I mean today Bajrang Pandey.. ...will kill ACP Mehra and his wife at the Old hill.. And I'll kill you here in police encounter. Don't move! Release Ballul - Release him! Run, Ballul Runl Run, Ballul Runl Madhu, you didn't do this right. Madhul In return of your obligation and respect-. ...my life was very small, Ballu. Please do rne one more favour. Yes, tell me. Ballu. I wish to die with nuptials. Do you remember what I had said? That I'll eat the betel leaf on the day.. ...when I'll bring you to my street. Minister, he got right to attach ACP with his name" ...he tried to rule the entire city. He's very dominating. What to say. If any weak hearted person were there" he'd have died at the same place. No, I mean to say nobody can tolerate so much of pain. Anybody would have died. But what have you thought about this ACP? Do you want to do anything or just tie him like this? Uncle, why butcher ties his goat? So that he can be killed. That's where you make mistake. Unless you kill the enemy with pleasure" ...you can't enjoy killing him. A husband always sees his wife with complete adornment. But till now this has never happened that a husband" ...would have seen his wife in the form of a widow. This ACP will see. Today I'll make your wife a widow in presence of you. Wowl What a plan, Bajrang Pandeyl Where's your brain? - Don't you know? I do the hair massage to Bajrang Pandey. In his skull. Tejul Your enmity is with me. Don't touch her, Bajrang. Had you left me on my request? Then how can I leave your wife on your request? Ballu?! The day I had done the first murder on your instruction" ...you had gifted this pistol to me. Today I'll do the last murder of yours with this pistol. Leave Rakesh and his wife otherwise.. All our plans have failed. What will happen to me if.. ...Bajrang Pandey will be arrested? I'll definitely loose my position. If brother in law is arrested, all of us will also be. Lallan, listen to me. He's your brother in law. If you don't mind I've an idea. - Who brother in law? And what's to feel bad? You please tell me your idea. If I'll remain alive. I'll definitely find many brothers in laws. C'mon, tell me. I'll call up the police and make your brother in law arrest. But I won't let you get arrested. I'll make you the witness. - Very good! You've a brain! Tell me something. Do you also do the hair massage? You can take it that way. Hello, police station! Lallan here. Bajrang Pandey's brother in law. Listen to me. I want to tell you about my brother in law's" ...illegal activities. Yes. My brother in law is a number one murderer, a dacoit. He's a smuggler. If you don't believe me then ask" the minister. He's with me. Talk to him. - Hello, inspector, minister Baxi here. From the high hill. Arrest Bajrang Pandey. Ok? He said everything true. Hurry upl Fast! - Please go ahead-. Ba.. b.. - Who? Who? Nol - Who? Please tell me. Pa Pandeyl Over there. What? - Your brother in law. - To hell with him. You please speak up. He's there. Brother-in-law, you? Look at him, brother in law. Look! He was calling up the police against you-. Nol - You consider him your friend. He's a deceitful person. Kill him. - No. He had called up to the police. Did I call up or you? - He. He's lying- - He... Brother-in-law, we're like a father and son. You worthless] Now I don't need you. What do you think that you.. Can dominate me with your power? ACP! Put on this to Devika, Rakesh. Nuptial woman's neck shouldn't be left blank. That's what public says. "I'm a broken Star. I'm a wanderer.." "I'm a broken Star. I'm a wanderer.." "My heart is crazy. Sorrow is my treasure." "My destiny has cheated with me."
