Nice sword. You were carrying this. It belongs to us. You tell us you are a commander. Well, look at your uniform. You're not the real commander. You tell us there are two Emperors. Two Romes. There was always been East and West. One is bad, one good. You say you know Katherine. So why do you not rescue her? I didn't know where she was until now. Is she was alive? Tell me this. If you represent Constantius, loyal to him, why did he not tell you of Katherine. He has always know. Before you go back to your prisoning cell. Can you tell me what this is? Nevertity. Isn't that straight? This is the only one that exist. And I know have never seen it before. But then you recognize her. Maxentius was right. You, she, were same. Maxentius says that you are no longer needed. And so you must debate with Rufus. When you are lose, and then he will tell you that you must die again. That should be a problem to Goddess.

We are told she is dead. But why can't she not raise from her tomb? We heard that those who believe in the one God as Katherine spoke of. Can sometimes rise from their tomb. No empire, no army of thousand could take away the pain, my friends feel right now. He will not rest until these people return her body. And if she isjust fell asleep, then she will stand. But, if she is trully dead on spirit. Then, my friend can say farewell. He was Constantine, want to meet Katherine. My dearest children, should you feel alone in nature. In mind, in such a vicious environment. Let nothing deter your true love. Which even at the worst time, can flow from your to other. They don't trust you. They think you'll take her away. Prove to them you're a man of your word. Show them, you're not just another emperor. They say, you are a great warrior. And they fear the God of Rome. For the God of Rome were angry at Maxintius. You're now the new king. Tell them I'm not the king. Tell them Rome got a lies. Katherine wanted me to set them free. To set these people free. So, tell them. Go. All of you. You're free! I ask you, to take, to protect, and to continue Building this stone for Katherine. To do what you wanted all of us to do. To allow all people, to allow them here and pray. In peace. Do not be afraid. This soldier will not harm you. Seek not to up who that which have been. For tell your life that never hope to for to tell your death. Be at plain and simple. No earth to keep. No priest to banish. No heaven to grass. No hell to enter. Shall this be upon. Or not from me. Yet seek, and some soul shall understand. Following the death of Constantine, Katherine's bone were unearthed, sold and distributed between the seven wealthiest churches in Europe, until a charter of protection was placed upon the rest of her remains, to this day the which lie within her monastery on Mount Sinai. Each year, millions of visitors pay homage to Saint Katherine. In 2000, church leaders reversed their 1965 denouncement of Katherine, and restained her as a saint. In keeping with katherine whises, her monastery welcome all faiths to enter into prayer within its walls. The Katherine wheel fireworks symbolises how the saint meet her death. Open your heart to God. And you'll have this spirit will lead you... To the Wonderman of Heaven. FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER AT THE HAND OF OTHERS. JVL
