We traveled in bands of five or six. We met in dark and secret places. We had taken a vow of silence. One of us was silenced forever. Most people remember the media frenzy that erupted in our town. But few know the true secret behind the Sisterhood of Night. Listen carefully. This is our story. It all started with one girl's decision to go offline. Mary Warren was a straight-C student who was voted, "Most Likely to Become Famous." Emily Parris was an only child with a blog that nobody read. She often prayed for new followers though most of the time she felt like a follower herself. Next. Why don't each of you tell me what happened. She ruined my audition! Stinking pitch. "Stinking pitch, that the sea, mounting to the... The welkin's ass cheek... ...to the welkin's ass cheek..." No! I mean "the welkin's cheek". Mr. Barry, can I start over? Mary!? How would you like it if someone messed up your audition? Let's see what you can do. "If by your art, my dearest father you have put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. She stole my phone. Emily read Mary's texts, posted them on her blog and made Mary's life one big humiliation. Didn't you see what Emily posted about Mary's mom? Mrs. Warren's having an affair with some guy at work. Did you see Emily's blog? It's like Fatal Attraction except nobody's died yet! Everyone move back. She called me a "blog war" in front of the whole school! A blog what? War! Don't you mean "whore"? The "w" is silent It is... Everyone was waiting for Mary to retaliate online. But on that night, Mary's Facebook status read: And she never logged in again. Dear Diary. Or whatever you're supposed to say. I can't remember the last time I wrote something that wasn't on my computer. I love the solitude of the night. And I want to plunge into secrecy. As in to black smoke. To disappear It was on this night that Mary began to form the idea of a sisterhood. Catherine Huang and Lavinia Hall were the first two girls to be trusted with the secret. Last week... What? I had this really bad thought. Bad as in badass or bad/perverse? Just bad. Like I don't wanna say it out loud. We're offline. You can tell us. Or write it down. That's what I do. You really can't tell anyone. I won't, I promise. ...You have to swear. It's our secret Cheers. Are you kidding? Are you kidding me? Everybody, that's the fire alarm. Single file. Everybody head for the exits. Just leave your belongings and head to the exits. No pushing. Oh my God! Everything that happens here stays between the three of us. You have my vow of silence. You have my vow of silence. You... have my vow of silence. Are you ready? I wouldn't say the Mary/Emily conflict was over by the end of the year, but they both moved on to other things. Mary with her photography and Emily with her acting class over the summer. Principal Harvey didn't think I needed to keep meeting with them. But no one could have predicted what was going to happen... Dear God, please help me make some friends at school this year. Please send Mary Warren away. Maybe she can get swine flu - I mean not seriously. Please help Mary see that she should forgive me because I was wrong and I'm sorry, and she should pick me to be in The Sisterhood. One or the other. Catherine! You're going to be late. I made you a BLT, your favorite. I buy lunch on Fridays. Mommy knows that. You're such a little poser. Alright... well I'll pick you up after school. Four o'clock? We'll go see her together. Okay. Bye Gong-gong. Hey kit cat. Hi. So my mom went back into the hospital. And... her hair is all gone now. I'm going to see her today. I just can't. Are you okay, honey? Lavinia? Morning. Hey. They should really get that sign fixed for you. Yeah, I know. But I secretly like It though. It keeps me humble. How's Lavinia doing? That good, huh... What's going on? Anything new? Any big changes? Well, I just started dating. Oh. Maybe she should start coming in to talk to you again, you know? During lunch like last year... she said you were a good listener. Yeah sure. I'm here. Just think it over and let me know. Okay. ...Travis, definitely. They're coming. Here they come. There were definitely rumors about The Sisterhood. Nobody knew what it was, which just made the girls who weren't in it want to be in it even more... But you had to be chosen by Mary. I was never really sure how Mary decided who to pick. We were all so different. With me, my family had just moved to Kingston from Oregon. I remember that whole week, I'd see Catherine Huang kind of watching me. And one day it started pouring. Everyone ran for cover. But I love the rain. And I missed it. Soon after that, Mary and Catherine gave me the secret sign and you had to figure out where the meeting was based on a clue. We'll see you later. Bye. Mary said I introduced her to photography. She said she took photographs to observe a world that just wanted to observe her, but what she taught me was how to see the mystery in life. You know, one of these nights I'm gonna follow you and find out what you do. Where were you at lunch? I had to make up that Math test... Hey, what do you guys think of Jeff Johns? I mean, he's cute. He's always staring at you on the way to school you know. Is he boyfriend material? Okay, who would you guys save from a burning building, Jeff Johns or Ryan Gosling? Sorry Jeff! From the girl who kisses his poster every night... Oh guys, this is how I practice. Wait, this is Travis I'm guessing, right? Of course this is Travis, who else would it be? You missed it! Okay, okay, okay. I promise I won't do that. Keep twirling Finally. That's a good one. Oh yeah you're crazy hot! You're like so attractive. Guys! Keep going. Hey guys, wait. Let's do something for the variety show. Really? Like a dance or something? Yeah. I mean like I can write the music and you can make the costumes and Mary, you can... I'll bust a move. No, but I mean seriously I think we should. Yeah, I think so too. - It'll be fun. - Let's do it. But only if the song is like... Amazing! More girls began to roam the night as new members were initiated. Not right now. Okay. Okay. Bye. Don't forget to silence your phones. Did you see her? Honey, we can move up. Come on. No! It's not fair. Emily. You don't know what she did to me! She always ruins everything. Why don't you tell everybody where were you last night, huh, Mary? Why don't you tell everybody about the big secret you're hiding? I saw her! I have the picture! Ask her what she was doing last night in the woods. Honey, stop it. Oh, Emily! Emily! Come here, honey. Lie her down. Lie her down. Emily? Are you alright? Explain yourself... Stop. Were you in the woods with Mary last night? ...yeah. What were you even doing in the woods?! Tom, take it easy. Can I have a glass of water. Sure. Oh God, your hand! Tom, look at that. Did this happen last night? It really hurt... it was bleeding. It's alright, honey. Don't be scared. There's nothing to be scared of. Just tell us what happened. We were all waiting after Emily's outburst. Mostly people were annoyed that mass was interrupted. None of us adults had ever heard of The Sisterhood before. And then Rhonda Potter came out. She had this look in her eye. And I heard her say these words. Three little words... It's a cult. You'll never be one of us What was Emily talking about? Mary? Answer your mom! We'll ground you. How about a week with no phone and no computer Oh great. Oh hey, did you talk to your dad? No way! I'm not saying anything. That's Emily's mom. She's walking up to your house! Shh, wait a minute. Your kid is totally out of control! I understand that you're upset, Sue. But Mary would never physically hurt anyone... Did you see the cut on Emily's hand? And I am sure there is some explanation for that. We should just get the girls together and they'll I think Mary's the one that needs the talking to. That's between me and her. This conversation is over. Uh oh Incoming. Oh my God, Catherine, you're so busted! What do I do? Oh, hi. Hi. I'm Sue Parris. Yes? I'm Sue Parris. How are you? My daughter Emily goes to school with Catherine. And I really wanted to talk to you about what happened in church today. Is... I know you weren't there. Is Grace here? Could the three of us talk? That's not possible. Could you step outside for a minute please? I found this in Emily's jeans. Have you seen anything like that? Hey. Hi. I am from the Kingston Chronicle. This is so exciting! I know both your daughters are involved in The Sisterhood, and I was hoping I could ask you a couple... My daughter has nothing to do with this. Okay, but... This is my home! Both of you, please leave. I'm so sorry to have intruded. Excuse me, Mrs. Parris. If I can just ask you one thing. Oh, I have to... If I could, hey... Sorry. You are on private property. I want you to take one of these. Dr. Post said it was okay. You had a long day. I want you to rest. Did you understand what the officer meant about pressing charges? Kinda. That unless you talk to him and you tell him what's really going on there is nothing that he can really do. But what would he do? We can talk about it tomorrow. I love you. And good luck on that French test. "Maison" is feminine! Okay, mom. That was last week. We gotta talk later, kiddo. Hey, Emily. Hey... How's your hand? It hurts. I saw the photo you posted of your boyfriend... He probably wants to beat the crap out of Mary Warren. Yeah, he's pretty mad... ...I heard Mr.Gambhir's interrogating all the Sisterhood girls. It's like the Inquisition! Tyra makes all the girls line up and then she tears 'em down! Your name's on the list, Emily. Good. As long as they get in trouble for... what they... did... What's really going on? This is potentially really serious. I'm trying to help you here. You have to tell me something. Give me something that helps me help you guys. Who is your favorite Beatle? Do you know, in ancient China, when you had a secret you didn't want to share with anyone, you would dig a hole into a tree, and then you'd whisper your secret into the hole. And then you'd fill it up with dirt and no one would know. You'd leave it there forever. That's beautiful. You hear that from your parents? I saw it in a movie. And Lennon. That's my favorite Beatle. Whose your favorite? George Harrison. But nobody knows anything about George Harrison. I like to keep his secrets. Excuse me, Miss Warren. I ask her a question, she just does not saying anything. She just sits there quietly. How's your hand, Emily? That must've really hurt. When you slid down those rocks. I don't know what she's talking about. Because if you're not used to that drop-off, it's really easy to fall. So you were in the woods, Mary? I didn't say that. You were chanting... You took off your shirt. You made me take off my shirt. Stop it! You grabbed my hands. You made me... Say it. You know exactly what you did! It's true. I know, Mr. Gambhir. They did it to me too! ...Catherine? What's happening? Get some water. Are you okay? Hey. I'll get the nurse. Everybody back to class. Go on back to class. Sorry, the girls are just... They're not really good friends. I mean, they're kids that she's known for years but I don't think they're anybody we can rely on. Just tell me... how can we protect our daughter? Look. Over here. I found something. - We found something. - What's this? Last night we found this in the woods. Come on, Mary. We know it's your handwriting. I'm not saying anything! Well then you'll be suspended. Again. - Could I just intervene? - I don't care! Oh, but I bet you care about the Halloween dance... and what about the Variety Show? I know you've been practicing a routine. You're such a clich. I'll let you two get started. I'm gonna have a cigarette. If we're just gonna sit here staring at each other like last time, I might as well, right? Are you crazy? Yeah, you're right. You should probably stay here. I don't want you getting into any more trouble. Besides, it's only good for third period. Where? It's a secret spot. Now, you may be asking yourself why didn't we just tell? It's a fair question. Our silence became our holy grail. In three days, our world would come crashing down. Anyone who Googled Kingston New York a month ago would have read about a quiet town the local papers once called an "archetype of happy suburbia." Google Kingston today and a story of sex and the occult emerges. Mary had this charisma but it was the kind that can turn dangerous. Look at The Sisterhood. Look what happened to me. Lizzie Ward said she was led to the cemetery, where the Sisterhood forced her to urinate on a Bible. Sarah Burnhart claimed her initiation was sealed by drinking a whitish fluid. Sarah remembered feeling out of control, and then fainting. Maria Cannito described a game called Band Camp, where girls had to wear masks and play their bodies like a musical instrument for strange men. I remember that game that Sarah talked about. Because I was the cello. Where were you? I just went out for a walk. Don't lie, Lavinia. Do not lie. I've been waiting and so patient, and just waiting for you to talk to me, but now... Maria Cannito just wrote on Emily's blog. She says... She says you guys hurt her, too. You went through my room? Mom! What if I went through your room?! But, Mom, I didn't do anything! You're the one that goes out with different guys every night! While everyone else's parents I hang out with my friends, Mom. What's so weird with that? But what do you do when you hang out with your friends? What do you do in the middle of the night that you can't tell anyone about? Does this have to do with The Sisterhood? No! Mom! Mom, stop! ROSE Let me see! What are you doing? Mom! Let... About The Sisterhood symbol having occult origins. The inverted pentagram has a star with five points to symbolize the elements, earth, wind, fire and water and the spirit and The Sisterhood circle has these five x's embedded in the same places. ...just breathe... Catherine? Are you awake? What are you doing? What is this all about? How can you cause so much trouble when Mommy is so sick? What's the matter with you? I'm not going to say anything to her and you're not going to either. Okay? Hau pu hau. I'm scared. Sweetheart, I'm scared too. I just... I just can't talk about it right now. There's a reason it's a secret. But you have to talk to me, because what if... What if what? There might be a time when it's just you, me and Henry And Gong-Gong? Yes, and Gong-Gong. Catherine... Catherine... Catherine. Someone asked me today if I felt like Joan of Arc. One day we will all be dead. But those who keep moving will never die. What happens in the woods at the end of our ritual is inexplicable. A clear, unspeakable calm. What shall we do, little sisters? The sky is falling. You look a little Courtney Love today. Before she went red carpet. I feel Courtney Love. Catherine, you're going to be late for career day. I'll pick you up after school to go see Mommy, okay? She says she can't. She has to study for a test. Well you can study at the hospital. She says "no". Catherine, cut it out. Ni zen mo I can't do it! She looks like an alien! She's bald and it smells - I can't! Just stop it! Catherine! Catherine. You don't know how out of hand this is. We need you here. Is Dad coming? ...No, but... It's fine. I don't even care. Good morning everyone. Good morning parents. Welcome to career day. Thank you for coming. We've got some great speakers... This is a public service announcement. I'm locked in here... - I - speak to you anonymously about the recent slanderous statements made by my classmates. For which the reason is Jealousy. The Sisterhood has given meaning to our lives. Miss Potter? Hello? To those of you who ask why we are bound by a vow of silence, I reply: To tell you the secret means to lose The Sisterhood forever. Listen to me. Disregard these lies and trust your daughters. Hello Hey, Mr. Gambhir. Hey. What's that? Hey guys. Say front page! Hey. Chocolate milk for me and soy chocolate for you. How did you know I'm vegan? I see you at the faculty cafeteria. Steve Harvey thought I should talk to you before the PTA meeting. I'm just so worried about her, and I think... She hates me. She doesn't hate you. Rose, they're at that age where everything is like, "Oh, nobody understands me." When I was sixteen, I ended up getting a tattoo. What'd you get? On my tattoo? I'll show you. Actually, what am I doing. I can't show you. I'll show you later... That came out wrong, I don't mean that I'm going to show you... Anyway... Do you have... Oh yeah. Here... Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry about that. Why don't you take care of those... I don't deserve to live. I'm sorry. It's okay. I haven't laughed in a while. Oh good, I'm glad you thought that was funny. That was nice. Hey Emily. I know your boyfriend's a fake. You are such a liar. Did you really think that you could just make this fake Facebook account for "Brad MacLaughlin, front man of Aussie boy band Tidal Wave" and pass him off as your boyfriend? Really?! I wonder what else you lied about, Emily... WTF, Catherine! ...you guys are fearless. They're totally going to Hell for not confessing. Mary doesn't care about going to Hell. They'll never say anything. It's sad. Hi Emily. I heard Lavinia Hall crying in the bathroom today. She's totally going in the psych ward. They'll probably be devils or witches for Halloween. I bet Lavinia would confess. So can I tell Emily you're in for Halloween? Lavinia. It's Lavinia, right? I hear you like girls. That's hot! Wait! Come back! I wanna be initiated! Yeah, I'm in. Lavinia? I hear you're the leader of a cult. Voodoo, I made us a new playlist. Seriously... you just get together to hang out and talk about stuff, right? I can't break the vow. I trusted you. You have to tell me what's going on. I don't wanna sneak around anymore. I'm just not into being your secret boyfriend. Should I use the pink feathers or the brown feathers? Whatever you think. I wonder if my mom will be home. You know, in time for the variety show. Mary...? Do you ever wish you could just live inside a song? Ugh, stop it. You're obsessed with this song. Come on. If I hear it one more time... This curfew makes me insane. I gotta go. Jeff. Mary? Is that you? Why are you out after curfew? Why are you out after curfew? I'm an adult, the curfew doesn't apply to me. Can I... Can I come in? The cops are circling the neighborhood. Mary, that's not appropriate. My dad's working in the city. I really don't care what my mom thinks. Sorry, Mary. That's really inappropriate. Please. Please. Can I use your bathroom? Xanax. Sleep. Mary listen, we got to get going. Hey Mr. Gambhir, what's... No-vo-al... Whoa, Mary, come on! That stuff is personal. You can't just go through people's things. Do I have to go in there, see what else is missing? No! God! Don't freak out. I was just wondering. Since I just took some. Oh my God. How many? Two. What's this? JENNIFER Hi Emily. My name is Jennifer, and I'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I know that your blog is for Sisterhood victims, but I've been molested too. I know this is a safe place. I have to tell you about what happened with my babysitter... It was so long ago, but I have to speak up. It's time. Jeff, he won't talk to me. This mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. Shit Good night, Ryan. Hi. I'm really sorry, Mr. G. It's okay. I'll see you at school. Mary? Mary, I know you're in there. Open the door. What were you doing over there? How do you think I felt? I'm checking my e-mail and there's a photo of you with a teacher, at night! And then you weren't in your room... Everyone knows... Sue Parris sent it to everyone! Including the Chronicle. Are you having sex with that man? Am I what? Is that what you wrote on the secret sign? No! How can you even ask me that?! Because I need to know the truth and for once you're going to tell me! Okay, Mom. I'm a witch, and The Sisterhood is a cult. What are you doing? Stop acting so crazy! God, what's happened? Why are we such strangers? Because I don't wanna be like you. I just don't know what to believe? I think it's more like who do you believe. Mary. Have you spent the night at Gambhir's apartment? Is he part of The Sisterhood's erotic rituals? REPORTER #3 Mary, are you in the lesbian sex cult? You have not come up with one answer. One answer! We left you with our daughters. We trusted you! Linda, did Mary tell you anything? She said nothing happened. And do you believe her? Mary's telling the truth. You know what - that doesn't get you off the hook! You let a student spend the night in your apartment. A girl who is confused and in way over her head. Look, I was trying to help. Mary was very upset. I tried to call you, Linda, but your voicemail was full. Gordy, I need your resignation. Why was she at his house? I don't know. Hey, chicas. Look, I really wasn't sneaking out to meet Mr. Gambhir. Then where were you going, Mary? Everything is just so messed up, Mary. We have to tell them, okay. Can we just tell them? What about the vow? Forget the fricking vow. Everyone's waiting for you to do something! Lavinia? We're going home. Now! I think we have to. We have to tell them. Lavinia! I tried to fix it, but it won't play anymore, so here's mine. On loan. I'll figure something out, I promise. Hey, come on. "I confronted my cousin and he admitted it. I couldn't have done it without you, Emily! Here's a song that keeps me strong." From KandyKane. Whoa, her cousin? That's wild! How are these girls finding me? What is The Sisterhood? What is The Sisterhood? What is The Sisterhood? Gordy Gambhir will not be leading the meeting tonight. I know that you have a lot of questions, and we will get to your questions one-by-one. Now we've already cancelled the variety show... Mr. G. What are you doing here? You said to give them a chance, right? There's a lot that we still don't know about The Sisterhood, but tonight I feel confident that we can begin a dialogue that will bring some calm to the community. And we need to support each other... Mary, what are you doing here? Let her speak! Yeah! What do you have to say? I... came here tonight to talk to you about The Sisterhood. We haven't done anything wrong. And neither has Mr. Gambhir... Mr. Gambhir is backstage. If he's not part of The Sisterhood, why is he here? Is there a reason you're here? Gordy, you shouldn't be here. I'm here on my own. You should leave. Look, I can't tell you exactly what The Sisterhood is... but I do know things about your daughters from just having the chance to talk to them... Mrs. Warren, are you going to press charges against this man? Gordy... Mr. Gambhir. Mr. Gambhir! Look, they're just girls! Listen to them! Listen, please. After what they put my families through?! They're still your daughters. Mom. It's okay. I'm here. I believe you... Mary, Mrs. Warren, right here! Get the hell out of here. Dear God, I'm so grateful for today. I feel like so many things have been leading up to this moment. Sit with my mouth 3 inches from the microphone. Try not to accentuate my P's or whistle on my S's. Please. Perfectly. Sisterhood. Stay in the moment. Use my imagination. Remember my wants, needs, and objectives. Amen... oh, and thank you for letting me go to my first real Halloween party tonight! Amen again. Anyone can read Emily Parris' blog. Which has become a confessional meeting ground for sexually abused girls. Miranda M. of Cleveland, Ohio and Jasmin22 of Middleburg, Virginia spoke about their experiences of sexual assault for the very first time on Parris' blog, both through artwork. Sorry. ...the first time he touched me, it was in my bedroom. I was only nine. I didn't know. The words to define that experience don't exist. Who are those other girls? You know them, you just never met them. That's KandyKane and Jennifer from New Mexico, Jasmin22... Our sponsor flew them out at the last minute to surprise you. I would just lie there, wait for it to be over... I haven't spoken him in over ten years. I hope he's out there listening. Joining us now, the reason this special group has come together. Emily Parris. Emily it's me, KandyKane from St.Louis! I never thought I'd have the guts to go on the radio and talk like this but... You inspired me. She inspires me. You're so pretty in person. She's so pretty... Emily, can you tell our listeners about the situation in Kingston, New York? What happened? What's happening? We were molested. What happened? Are you okay? It's just really hot in there... Seeing those girls in person - it's just so hard. I don't feel so great. You can pop a Tylenol when we get back to my place. You packed your costume, right? I love that we all match! I just... I don't know if we should do it anymore. But Travis said he's in and it has to be tonight. To go with the whole witch thing. Yeah, and what about the party after? What if we just go to the party? Why're you freaking out? I think you liked what they did to you. I can't sleep over anymore. There you are. Mom. Hey. I wanna go home. What if she tells her mom? She won't. Hello? You have to come with me. I need you. I can't do this alone. Lavinia, there's something I need to... Are you going on another date? You can just say. Yes, I am. The same guy, the dentist. So Mrs. Olsen's going to stay. I love you. Hello? Lavinia. Do you know who this is? I don't know. I think you're hot. Now do you know? Can you come meet me at the sign? I don't know. Come on. It's Halloween. I don't even have a costume. I have one for you... Hi, you've called Lavinia. Please leave a message after the beep. Hi Lavinia, it's Emily. If Travis calls you, don't go out tonight. Just don't go. Trust me. It's the tattoo. Five girls. Five x's. Hi Lavinia. Hi... Let's go for a walk. Okay. Wanna sit? Sure. Lavinia... have you ever made out with someone? No. Do you want to? Yeah. With you. Can you take your shirt off? You're so beautiful. No I'm not... Yeah, you really are. So what's the deal with the Sisterhood? OMG, I can't believe her! Travis...? Travis! No! No! Please! No! I'm mean to my sister because she's prettier than me. I read my dad's Playboys. I kissed a girl at camp. I make myself throw up. I keep skipping gym so I don't have to change in front of anyone. Doug Ryan never called me after we hooked up. Because I wouldn't go down on him. When I'm really mad I cut myself. ...I'm scared I'll never be happy. This is the only place I feel safe. My dad lost his job, and we might have to move. I'm scared for my brother. I had an abortion. Sometimes I tell my mom I'm with my friends and I drive to the city alone. Most of the time I feel invisible. When I write poems, I try to think like God. I want to change the world. I lost my virginity. My spirit is a song. No one's ever going to kiss me. I wish my mom would die - or get better. For my first time, I want to be in love, not just have sex. I've been afraid to say this until now, I love Jeff Johns. I miss my mom. Why's she coming with us to the party? Why are you coming? Shut up! I want her to. We'll let her go after the party. Yeah, she's still pretty drugged out. What a freak! We're witches! Okay? What's going on? No! No! No! Travis - please! Just let me go home! What are you going to do with that? It's already done! Dad? Are you there? This is Lavinia. This recording? I can't sleep. I just wish it were tomorrow. Please hurry. She's not... she's not breathing. She's not moving, I don't know what happened. Lavinia? We're standing outside St. John's church in Kingston, New York where Lavinia Hall's funeral will be taking place in an hour. Lavinia Hall is the fifteen-year-old high school student who took her own life last week. - You got it? - Yep. Dear God... Will you do something for me? Yeah. Anything. I'm sorry, Mary. I'm so sorry! I... lied about that night. I just wanted to be in The Sisterhood. Mary saw me. Then they just walked me out of the woods. Please. I could just tell everyone everything! And then you wouldn't be able to meet in the woods anymore. I was so mad. I fell. I cut my hand. And that was it. I should have helped Lavinia, but I was too scared. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Emily was wrong to lie. But she helped me speak out. And her blog helped me find so many other girls who needed to speak their truth. Hi. Hi, Mrs. Hall. That's her song for the Variety Show. "L' Espirits Des Animaux" Spirit Animals. I think we should do the dance. For Lavinia. So this is your secret spot? Yeah. What are you doing? Can I do it too? I changed my mind I don't wanna do it anymore. You don't have to, Henry. Ah, hi Gong-Gong. I was just... Catherine. You're here. Yeah. Oh baby. What did you do to your beautiful hair? Sweet dreams. I love you, baby. I love you too. "The girls of The Sisterhood shut out the noise in their lives by sharing their deepest dreams, pains and desires, then renewing their bond of friendship through silence." You look like a white wolf warrior. You look like a David Bowie bird. Catherine. Ready? The Sisterhood continues to surface in new towns as the secret is passed on. We long to remain mysterious. To evade definition. Tell us, you cry. Tell us everything and then we will forgive you. But we do not wish to tell you everything. This is our secret. Hence our silence. We plunge into secrecy. As in to black smoke. To disappear.
