He is right in questioning them Or are you fooling yourselves? - Will you tell them face to face? - Why buy trouble, sir? Best to be unnoticed Then why are you even seated here? Leave now Do you get pleasure in listing out all the faults of our children? They are sitting here with the herd mentality! According to them more than their kids being happy they should retain their sense of prestige in front of others Only that matters to them A child will play That's natural Why do you highlight it as a fault? You complained a dime a dozen Know what he'll do to his son at home? Don't run in Waaaait! Don't, don't hit our son This is how 90 % of the parents react How will the kids like their parents or the school? Shouldn't he be eager to meet the teachers in school? You are frightening the children When will you let him be free? When will he be happy? None of your concern, sir It is MY concern, madam Who else will ask? This is my son's future If he's in trouble my son should believe his father will bail him out How many parents here give that assurance?

Ask your child too More than 50% will endorse Vetris statement Pa, even I do not like this school one bi- Let's go Mr Dhaya You're ruining your son's future thanks to your short temper and ego Son's future is not with the school It is within himself "Mankindthe entire human race Where are you headingwhich place?"

As your father I believe I have done a good job raising you . Now even I cannot make you go astray . You have matured to that extent . Do only what you can feel comfortable telling me . Don't do what you can't tell . Because that is wrong . Okay, pa . I want to see my mother . Godspeed, son . Hello, uncle . Junior uncle . How are you? . Who the hell are you? . Your sister's son . Hi senior uncs! . Your moustache looks terrific . Gawd! It's terrifying! . Sweet cousin! Which grade are you in? . As if he goes to school! All he does is hog food 24x7 and lead a cushy life . His upbringing is such! Give me one . - What is your name? - Clear off! . Sounds rude Your father named you? . What's up? Care for a banana? . Was that a dig at me? . Why did you come here now? . To settle down here for good . I believe you were hell bent on separating me from my father . So my father sent me away I decided to come here . Uncs, which school will you join me in? . I need to swim Find me a good pool . 100m long . I am doing research in history Find me a good library . Get me a cycle, uncs . I don't drive around in cool comfort like you . With 21 gears . Why are you staring so blankly? . With your money, maybe you can draw different moustaches on your face . But that cannot guarantee your son will turn out good . It requires a good heart . Would you be around 45 years? . Will people few streets away know you? . I am just 15 years old . The whole world knows me . That's my father...! . - Vetri...? - Grandpaaaaaa! . I told you to shave your sickle moustache . You deserve to be disgraced! . Ma, I'm hungry . Ignore her . 'You just ate like a glutton' . This lends us dignity . - Bless me, grandpa - May you be happy . You look awesome, grandpa . You are as fit as a farmer! . You remind me of your father . He's a man after my own heart . He tolerated all the legal hassles your mother gave him . He stood firm, bound by my words . Dhayala, I think this is a bad phase for her, based on her karma . She seems possessed by some spirit . Don't abandon my daughter . You trust me so much I will never let you down . I won't let her go or let go of her . What he promised me that day, he has kept his word till date . If he had signed the divorce papers she would have drifted aimlessly . That's my father...! . - Where is my mother? - She must be hiding somewhere . Only if she is still with her husband will her tantrums work at home! . She expected everyone to toe her line They slowly sidelined her to the backyard . Her protests fall on deaf ears . She has also mellowed down . Poor thing! . Time is the best healer . Grandpa, why talk of the past? . That time is dead and gone . Let us be happy in the little time we have . My brothers' wives will hog, when I go to eat, they will add ladles of salt . If I want to boil water to bathe, they will claim there's no cooking gas . And rip apart my sarees left to dry on the clothesline . You came like a godsend! . Appa . Mother will be living with us . As you please . Come in, ma . What brings you here in this rain, pal? . I have a guest at home . I thought I could stay here for a few days . Who is this guest throwing you out? . Malar...! . Come in, quick . Come in . Buddy? . You've globe trotted on a pic-hunt! . From deities to doers . Surrounded by pictures of bachelors... . ...you decided to let your life go by . Are brides in a queue? Just not happening . Must make it happen . There's a time for every event . If that time expires we are fit for an exhibition . I have all the creature comforts one could ask for . Along with it emptiness too . What kind of life am I leading! . Close relatives don't invite me for auspicious events, they avoid me . Relatives are redundant . They want their kith and kin to suffer and they will dole out free advice . Why should they disown us? We will discard them . months ago my own uncle didn't let me spend the night . Asked me to leave because my cousin is in her s . It was raining cats and dogs . I got drenched to the skin . You live only once, buddy . Carpe diem! Seize the day . Go ahead, eat . Hi Vetri! . What brings you here? . - Come home - Vetri, sit . Sit down . She has come home after many years . If I am hanging around she will feel guilty, poor soul! . I'll come - days later when things settle down . Did I trouble you by bringing mother home? . I knew when you went she would follow you . Do me a favor, bring me some of my clothes . Okay, pa . - Bye, uncle - Take care . 'M.Adaikathaan Vice Principal' . What is it? . I have passed, sirrrr! . - Beware! - Disturbing me so late? . Give me the mark sheet Your towel is the icing on the cake! . Will meet again, sirrrrrrr! . Your hair-do is hair-raising! . I stole it yesterday . - Don't flick my cup too - I won't need it . - Thanks, friend - My pleasure . Why haven't you joined 11th grade? I have to earn money . My dad has left behind a cart load of debts . I can compre and straight away do my masters, right? . - years later I want to start a channel just for kids . That's my plan . I will invest . Bachelor Sundaram as Mr Benevolent! I can come back home by myself, pa . Come, Banu . - What's your choice? - History . Let me also stick to you .

No one should cry because of me! . - What is your subject? - You tell me? . You tell me what your dream is . I'll tell you the pros and cons . We'll discuss but you decide . Farming . We don't have to discuss this at all . Only department in our land needing our help is agriculture . Good Go ahead . The farmers' plight is pathetic . Shouldn't we treat them like God for feeding us? . We take their pain for granted . We should help the farmers . Your good heart will get you through . - Take Science group - Okay . Stick to one . With 4-5 channels we have a wider choice! . Sympathy, huh? . So sad! He reminds me of my elder sister . She isn't finding the right groom at all . Shall we link them together?

She doesn't even wash her face Only if I insist, she'll dress up well . Pssst! . This is a golden opportunity for her to know more about your father . You've touched the sky! . No flattery, please . 'Who is the tallest of them all?' . Those who deride the vertically challenged! . Discuss the elevated status of a heart instead . Those who measure my head from the ground and gloat . Measure from the skies instead . I am the tallest then . I will say this loudly for the world to hear . This is our poet's st creative gem . Now the most awaited book launch will be inaugurated before our eyes . (loud applause) . Malar! When did you come? . It has been a week . I'll call you later . Please don't...I'm happy as I am . To begin this event with a welcome speech, we invite 'Black Lion' poet Yugabharathi . Hearty welcome to all . 'Who is the tallest of them all? ' I am happy to be here for this book launch . I am in fact very sure in this sphere... . ...junior-poet Mayil will attain great heights . Ma...hello . Sis, welcome . This is Nandhini's sister . Hello . Nandhini's mother . Enough, sir Sit down .

I'll kill him . - Pretend you can't hear - Ask him to change his T-shirt . At least change your spouse . If we look for an answer to Where is poetry? . Poetry is everywhere . Our junior poet Mayil is a sterling example to this . I welcome this young budding poet to the world of pen, paper and poems . We invite the accomplished poet Mr Pa.Vijay to say a few words . Warm welcome to all of you . Even the atom bomb explodes just once . But it is said every time a book is read, it flares up the mind . Poets like me write with the help of a pen . But to think this book has been written by a pen... . ...gives me great joy . Vote of thanks by child-poet Mayil Vaandu . (whistling) . I feel very happy today . My father brought me up saying 'We should not be noticed' . Maybe that is why I'm too small for anyone to notice me . The person who made everyone notice me is Dhaya-appa . Maybe if he was my father instead of you... . ...I might have grown tall . Dhaya-appa made me realize academics and achievement are not linked . There are many way to lead a good life He made me understand this too . I have a feeling of standing tall . Even my sister considers it a disgrace to call me her little brother . Walk ahead or follow me . Don't tag along My friends make fun of me . You left your record note book at home, akka . You sat up the whole night working...here . Give it to me . Sorry, bro . My poor mother! She cries thinking of me . I'll make you proud, ma Don't worry . Don't cry, ma . I feel like crying too . We invite our little poet Mayil's father Mr Nadunilayan to the stage . Whatever he said is 100% true . I am terrified of everything . I am scared of this society . Petrified of our civilization . My father and grandfather led a life of constant fear . Marrying this lucky lady I got used to city life . If it was a feat being a city dweller... . ...then educating my son was even more of an achievement . He didn't grow Neither did his intelligence . The Principal sent him home saying he will not pass 10th grade . Vetri, Mr Dhayal's son was the one... . ...who admitted him in a private tuition . And made him pass the exam . This man broke all barriers . My deep seated inferiority complex . My fear . He breached it . Vote of thanks by Mr Dhayalan . In this world that we inhabit . 'You can do it' . 'You will do well in life' . 'Make impossible possible' . 'Be strong' . To say such words that build confidence... . ...there are very few . Try motivating those who are depressed . They will burst into action and achieve the impossible . Words of confidence are the catalyst for new discoveries . All I did was infuse confidence . His talent and skill were embedded in him . I was just a tool to bring it out . Cheers! . I thank each and everyone here who honored my invitation . My sincere thanks to all of you assembled here . 'Sweet ball' . (phone rings) . I'll be back . 'I didn't expect you to call so soon' . Your sister and uncle exchanged numbers . I noticed it . The caller ID was 'Sweet ball' . Don't know who it was .

Way to the heart is through food! . Is that why you are so handsome? . I'll eat the same from tomorrow . You can eat right away I'll send it to you . (phone rings) . Vetri...your mother . Next bomb to explode! . Ma...? . Why do you pick his call? Let me talk to your father . She wants to talk to you it seems . Yes, Malar . You won't talk to me, huh? . I'm being my usual self . You've come back just now So it all seems new to you . You don't have to stay away at night . - Come home - Okay . Howzaat?! . Sixer! . Aiyo! I'm so bored by your string of praises, Vetri . Don't flatter me please . Allow me to eat 'biryani' . Clean polish your plate! . He's brilliant with words Don't judge a book by its cover! . Ma...ma, listen I'm not feeling- . Instead of talking to your mother if you study you'll excel, right? . He wanted to tell me something . Why waste time in gossip? Focus on your studies . Appa- . Achieve first We can talk later . Finished talking? Go and study now I'll call just once . (phone rings) . Who is it? . Looks like a new number . We'll lend a hand whoever it is, talk . Chakkarai! Why are you calling so late? . I don't like this place one bit . Warden takes us to a dark room and hits us for the smallest of mistakes . Why don't you tell your father? . Why are you crying? . What is it? . What's wrong? . He is crying . Want to talk? . Chakkarai, don't cry . Listen to me, don't cry Nandhini wants to talk . Security . He isn't there . He was there all along . Chakkarai! . Don't cry . This is a psychological problem . To be in the place he likes with his loved ones, in his comfort zone . To talk and laugh non stop . Why don't you do this? Tomorrow is a holiday .

Use this for your travel expenses . I feel sorry for him, ma . Parents can come only in the time specified by us . Friends! . Did he contact you? . Sir, he- . - He...? - Sir . He didn't get in touch, sir . We came of our own accord . We miss him a lot . So we came to see him . We'll see him just once, sir . GET OUT! . They have only one way . With our will, we'll find a way . Don't do anything drastic . Pleading is of no use, only if we knock the door will open . - Why are we at the rear? - I have no clue . We can't reach even if we climb on each other's back . Don't keep looking up Look here too . Call the cops if I am not back within an hour . Mayil...? . Hey! What are you doing over there? . Get inside . How did you land here? . Everybody looks up only to the sky . Who is this? . My friend . Why are you loitering about? Go and study . My friend . I am Mayilvahanam . Sriram .

Definitely I love him . I'll make the impossible possible . Run . Go away . (phone rings) . Whaaat? Calling from the school? My dignity and self respect All gone for a toss . Total disgrace . Do I have to apologize? Bow my head in shame? . - Where are you going? - Let me also come . Your son has made a mess and you want to tell the whole world? . Don't rile me- . I'll also come with you- . I knew when you were hiding from me and talking over the phone . My gut feeling was right . - Your shirt! - Bring it for God's sake . Just what I didn't want to happen . How did he jump over the wall? . Our son wouldn't have done anything wrong . Please let me come with you . I raised my son so well and you're such a bad influence on him . You pampered him . - No - Shut up! . If you get a call tell them I'm on my way . Take me with you . I'll deal with you later . Appaaaaa....! . You son is a bad influence on the other boys as well . Take him with you right now . Father....appa...they were- . Don't hit him . - Appa - Don't! . Let go of him . - Pa - Sir . I apologize on my son's behalf . Stop acting! Take him with you . - Sir...? - Hear me out, pa . He's my only child . He is my future . Be magnanimous and let him study here . Get lost! . - Who are you? - Driver, sir . Wait outside . Please save me I beg of you . Don't spoil my son's future . Allow him to continue here . - Get up - Take me away from here . They humiliate me all the time . They hit me, pa . 'I take responsibility for my son's future actions' . If they didn't let you meet him... . ...you should've called me or come back home . Getting inside through the rear was wrong . Chakkarai was very happy, pa . So what? Whose idea was this? . Sorry, pa . How dare you push that kid! . I swear I will- . Sir, don't . I'll kill your son right now . Mind your words! . What bloody 'words'! . I vacated my house years ago only because your son is a bad influence . I shifted him 250km away . Didn't you learn a lesson? I'll kill you . These 4 brats have gone and ruined my son's life . If you defend them are you also part of it? . What's wrong with you, sir? . Why are you accusing me of conspiring? . If you had sat with your son and asked him what was troubling him . ...these kids need not have gone there . Trying to advise me? . Not advice Affection! . Be a 'father' to him . Fatherhood is a beautiful bond . Get into his heart and elevate him . Instead you treat him like a bloody slave . - Poor boy! - Who are you? . He stood st in class because I raised him well . He will stand first in his grade always . One day he will be 1st in this world- . 'First' is all you care about . What's so great about it? . He's1 st only in academics In his life he is a zero . Teach your son to adapt to our society . Please tell me in what way have you led a great life . for you to torture him like this? Have a handful of people blessed you? . Or have you fed the hungry? . You lead a bloody selfish life And you're teaching him, huh? . Why are you emptying your trash on your child? . How dare you call me 'trash'?! . Not more word from you! . You or I can't decide whom they should befriend, it's their world, their choice . I choose to decide! . What my son has study and where! . I decide whom he should befriend or make out with . Kids are around Mind your words . Get lost! . If you go anywhere near my son once more... . I'll kill you! . Who is on the phone? Let me speak . We aren't fighting over any inheritance . We just differ in our opinion and the way we raise our kids . I treat your son as my own . Please understand . Let me speak . Tell me . Chakkarai- . Our son Chakkarai tried to commit suicide . His life is not in danger . But they want us to come right now . Please come home soon . - What happened, pa? - Tell us what's wrong . - Wait - What happened? . Tell us, please . You got a flat tyre . Vetri, bring our car Whatever I did was for his own good . He meant the world to me and I gave him the best of everything . Sir, have you seen any father love his son the way I did? . He didn't understand me at all . Why did he resort to this? . We should be in his shoes to know his pain . Don't cry imagining the worst . Not the end of the world . We'll bring him back and he'll be with us . I'll let him follow his own dream . I was stupid enough to brag I was the reason for his success . Even if I hadn't stifled him he would have stood 1st . We were told a student by name Chakravarthy attempted suicide, sir . He's in a hospital close by . - Which hospital? - 10 km from here . - Why hospitalized? - He will be fine, come . - Student Chakravarthy - Not this hospital . He has been taken for an MRI scan to the nearby hospital, go there . My dearest son! . God! Show my son to me and let me know he is safe . Please don't cry . Where are you, son? . Making us go around in circles . His parents are here . You handle this yourself . Why make us roam around? . Is this how you treat your parents? . We trust you with our children . You didn't even give us proper information . Talk to my boss He is over there . Hello, sir Please come . Please take a seat . Sit down . Sit- . Don't interrupt . Permit us to take our son back with us . By all means do so This is our hospital . He is fine, don't worry, we have brought in a doctor from Madras . He is being treated now . Don't be tense . Get them some juice . We just want to see our son . Give our son back to us . Dr Kumaran wants to see you . Come through the rear entrance . Come inside . Your son? . My friend's son, sir . How did they let you in? . This whole block is under their custody . The school's reputation is at stake it seems . Big deal, their blessed reputation! . Kids nowadays are very smart . Only parents and schools are at fault . Achievers in this world were only ordinary students . Sachin Tendulkar, A.R.Rahman Bill gates, Steve Jobs . Why do you never realize this? . If every child should score 100/100 who will get 80% or 90%? . It's scary to even read the newspaper when exam results are announced . From Manikandan, Rohit to Saranya, Priyanka including Dhairya Lakshmi! . Dhairya Lakshmi means 'Courage' If she resorts to this... . ...who is pushing her to it? . One never knows if this is suicide or murder till the end . You shower love on them as babies and then kill them! . Parents are the last hope for children . 'You break that hope to bits' . No one has the right to punish students . He has been hit brutally . He complained of bad food . They stripped and hit him whole night through . This is the letter he wrote . Read it, you'll know how much of pain and disappointment he must have felt . Why are you spoiling for a fight? . You killed that poor child . 'Hey Babu! Kill that son of a mongrel' . It is 8hours since the boy died! . They made you wander deliberately to kill your emotions . Make you numb, so you won't yell at them . That's the usual procedure here . Vetri, get some water . - Okay, pa - Call the doctor . This boy had some love affair . It failed and so he committed suicide . 'He was using a mobile which is against our rule' . 'He got filthy messages in WhatsApp' . ' And he has replied too' . We have all the evidence- . That's a lie . 'He's a student of that school' . They are lying through their teeth! . 'Come, let's hear him out' . 'Tell us what happened' . 'Don't be scared' . 'Tell us the truth' . He was stripped to the skin whole night and made to stay that way, sir . Babu, how did he land here? . He went through hell, sir . Let me teach him a lesson . Babu, police Let's clear out . Let's quietly leave . Sir, they are trying to get away . Hello! Stop . Stop right there . My boss wants to talk to both of you . Don't get humiliated in public Better come and meet him . I want to see him . I have to see him . - See him - Come . 'Appa' . It's alright . Look over there . Vetri is standing there Be with him . Formalities are over . You can take the body . Who is there for me? . I'm there for you, pa . I'll be there for you . I'll be with you always . 'Your children who are a part of you whom you have brought into this world' . 'Don't just raise them 'Gift them a good upbringing' . 'Your faithful friend P.Samuthirakani' .
