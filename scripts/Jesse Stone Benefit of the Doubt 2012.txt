I didn't say that. I asked you why. I don't know. Seems kind of cop-ly. I'll just call you Chief. Now that I have you back, I want you happy. Call me Skipper. The caller said some kids started a fire out on the point and they were worried about their house. It was raining. They leave their address? They hung up. Eh, probably... A crank. A police officer cannot afford to be wrong. It has to be checked out. He hated me calling him Skipper. Have you seen him? I don't like him. I didn't ask if you liked him. I asked if you'd seen him. Nope. Doesn't seem that anyone has, not for months. He didn't... Like you. Why do you think? Beats me. What's not to like? Made me do stupid things. He made me feel... Unlikeable. He's not someone who should spend a lot of time alone. He made me order a hat. Why did he make you order a hat? Because it was a stupid thing. He didn't like the color of our hats. He wanted one in... Navy blue. Stupid. And on the back he had me embroider... Chief. Can I ask you a question, Skipper? How do I always know what you're going to say? Yeah, you finish my sentences. It's a gift. I sure don't see any smoke. It still has to be checked out, Anthony. Do you remember where you ordered that hat? You want a blue hat? You know, when I said it was a stupid thing, I didn't mean the hat itself was stupid. Making me do it was stupid. I could have been writing parking tickets. I want a blue hat. But you want "Skipper" on the back? How about "Chief"? DeAngelo... If you're lost you might be talking to the wrong guy. Hello, Jesse. Hello, Hasty. Your front door was unlocked. Oh, my God. Your phone's disconnected. It is. Councilman Hansen. We need to talk. They said he couldn't have felt anything. Uh, we wanted to talk to you on our way out there... I'm sorry, Mr. Hansen. - How can I help? - He was such a fine boy. I know you didn't like him. I don't think I ever said that. You know, my daughter is... My grandson... ...doesn't understand. What do you know? Nothing. The State Homicide commander is on the scene, and as official representatives of Paradise, we need to be kept up to speed, but he's not going to tell us anything. You have no need to know. I know that he is your friend. Can you help us? I have no authority. He is my friend and he's a good cop, but he's not going to tell you anything. I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed beyond this point. Uh, I don't think you know who we are. We represent the Paradise Town Council. This is Carter Hansen-- he's our president. His son-in-law was killed in the accident. I'm Jesse Stone, Paradise Police Chief. Temp chief. No temp, just chief. Is that correct? That is correct. Chief Stone, would you like to come with me? I'm sorry. You'll have to stay here. But we're the town council. I'm sorry, Mr. Hansen. Is William still down there? Yes, sir, two bodies. It's a crime scene. I understand. You're calling it a crime scene. Obviously this wasn't an accident. Chief Stone. Hell of a way to get back in the game. Back for good? I think we just settled that. Is this a great country or what? You said "bodies." Yep, two of them. His deputy was driving him-- an Officer Anthony DeAngelo. Okay. You know him? I fired him. Hansen shouldn't see this. Nothing left to identify, really. Fire took care of that. What caused the fire? Explosion-- big one. You want to kill a cop, why be so conspicuous? Talk to me before you leave. Jesse. Doc. You're back? I'm back. They won't let me do anything, Jesse. What'd you tell 'em? That I'm the part-time medical examiner. It's my job, Jesse. They have no reason. Did you show 'em your card? I only had my pediatrician card. That would be a reason. Did you touch anything? I didn't pollute the crime scene, Jesse. How'd you know? I always listen to police radio with my morning coffee. That's good police work, Doc. I'm the Paradise police chief. This is my M.E. Peter Perkins. May I? I know you didn't like Chief Butler. I don't think I ever said that. He had a kid. What do you think? I think they're dead. The explosion came from the outside, from underneath. If it was Iraq, I'd know what to think. The Feds come in on this, they'll screw it up. It isn't terrorism. No, it's not. That was where the spare tire should be. A lot of cash. What's in the packages? What do you think? I think a cop deserves the benefit of the doubt. My guys will keep this in house. If you say so. I say so. Jesse, this is a State Homicide operation. Don't invent anything on your own. I always knew I'd get my job back. Fate wouldn't do that to me. If you say so. You have violated a protected area. The police have been called. Leave immediately. You have violated a protected area. The police have been called. Leave immediately. You have violated a protected area. The police have been called. Leave immediately. You have violated a protected area. The police have been called. Leave immediately. You have violated a protected area. The police have been called. I'm looking for one of your tenants. What's with the hat? You're acting like you're the police chief. I am the police chief. Since when? Since today. I know, it's April, and I'm overwatering. It's not that. Damn shame about Chief Butler. It is. Rose's husband. Do you have a warrant, Chief? It's not that kind of thing, Stan. He's probably on a monthly. Well, we have a lot of those, Jesse. As you might remember. You also might remember I have a policy of confidentiality. It's given me many repeat customers. Perhaps you could think of me as a former tenant. Why did you leave anyway? You know I fixed the leak in your unit, got rid of the moldy carpet. Jim Gammon. Cottage 30. Hello, Jesse. Jim. I'm looking for Rose. You didn't expect to find her here. I did not. You don't know, do you? What don't I know? I thought you were close. We are close. But you don't know where she is. That's correct. She took my kids away from me. Can you think of a reason? I know a lot about divorce. I don't have to talk to you. You got somebody you can talk to? I know someone. She sold the house. You're such a good friend? Find her. Some kids have started a bonfire out on the point, okay? I'm worried about my house. Some kids have started a bonfire out on the point, okay? I'm worried about my house. Where's Molly? You mean Rose. Why am I always calling Rose Molly? I have no idea, Hasty. So where is Molly? She quit to have baby. Wait a minute. Didn't she quit to have a baby? When was that? Three years ago. So, where's Rose? She's not here. Well, who's manning the phones? No one. You think that's wise? I don't. This is an emergency; I think you should call Rose Tell her to come in. I don't think I can do that. Because? My sense is she quit. No, Luther quit. He did. So, where's Rose? She quit. How do you know? Because no one's manning the phones. What do you know? I know she left town. No, I mean about the murders. How do you know it's murder? Well, they sure didn't blow themselves up. What do you know? I can't tell you. Why can't you tell me? Because I'm the police chief. I represent the town council. Hasty, you just got back on. Carter Hansen's the president. He represents the town council. Jesse, how do you think you got your job back? You think Carter Hansen wanted it? I wouldn't think so. I'm very fond of you, Jesse. I know that, Hasty. Was that the phone message that sent them to the point? You weren't supposed to hear that. I think that Butler was mixed up in something illegal. You're not a cop, Hasty. What do you know? You need someone manning the phones. Skeffington, Skeffington, cast your vote for Skeffington  He's the man  With a plan that'll work for you and me  He's no fool, he's for you  He's our favorite son  Hurry up, hurry up... I hope I didn't keep you waiting. I came as soon as I got your message. My cell phone doesn't get reception at my house. I always wanted a son. Do you think State Homicide is holding back information? Couldn't say. Do you feel up to answering a few questions? I've talked at length with my daughter, but she and my grandson need time. I understand, sir. When was the last time your daughter saw her husband? He left about 5:30 yesterday morning. Was that unusual? Well, not lately. My son-in-law's been putting in a great deal of time at work. He's been preoccupied. We should know more by now. In an investigation like this, particularly with the death of police officers, they will be concerned that details would alert and inform whoever did this. If somebody wanted to kill two police officers and they wanted to get away with it, why would they be so blatant? Why wouldn't they make it look like an accident? I would only be speculating. Well, go ahead. Speculate. I can't, Mr. Hansen. I'm aware of the difficulties we've had in the past, but... I'd appreciate it if you'd call me Carter. When did you first hear about the explosion? from State Homicide. And you called Hasty. Well, Hasty already knew, so we decided to go out there together. Do you know of anything specific that your son-in-law was working on? No. He kept so much inside. I'm gonna need your help, Carter. I will have to talk to your daughter. Will you tell me when you think she's up to it? Okay. I know you're a good cop, Chief Stone. Get the man who killed my son. There were times I hated him. Why did you hate him? Because he wasn't me. You mean because you weren't him. He had my job. Did you ever wish he were dead? Yes. Apparently, I wasn't shy about telling people I didn't like him. I thought I only thought it. How do you feel about that? How do I feel about that? I didn't like him. He didn't make me lost my job. That was solely my accomplishment. Okay. Are you gonna obsess about this? Yes. Because you're guilty about how you feel? 'Cause I'm a cop. Good. That's relatively healthy. Thank you. I've lost my people. What happened? Suitcase didn't like Butler, so he quit. And that's your fault? What about Rose? She was my friend, and I lost touch. Did she like Butler? No. So she quit. Apparently. And that's your fault, too? Did I ever tell you that you have a hyperactive sense of responsibility? Several times. Hasty told me the town council felt they both had been infected by me. That guy is a piece of work. How can you believe anything that comes out of his mouth? I sift through his words for partial truths. Well, let me get this straight-- he hires you because you're a drunk and thinks he can control you. You prove he can't. You send him to prison for laundering money for Gino Fish. He gets out of prison, starts up a car dealership with no visible financial backing. That would be him. What's your take on the murders? You miss being a cop, don't you? Every day. But being a cop was toxic for me-- made me drink. Being a cop's the only thing that makes me drink less. Word in Paradise is that Butler was dirty. Small town. So, you think he was dirty. I didn't say that. A cop deserves the benefit of the doubt. Hello? It's Jesse. Is it as cold there as it is in Toledo, Jesse? I would have no way of knowing, Mary. How'd you know? I didn't. It's okay, Mom. Oh. Hi, Jesse. Hello, Rose. Why didn't you tell me your chair was so uncomfortable? I'm sitting at your desk. Why are you sitting at my desk? Because I'm the police chief. You're the retired police chief. Just police chief. You told me you'd get your job back. You said, "Fate wouldn't do this to me." Not like this. How are Chief Butler's wife and family? You heard. I heard. Well, I haven't talked to him. I'm trying to give him some time. Carter Hansen's devastated. He loved his son-in-law; he loved him like a son. Does April 24 mean anything to you? Yes. What's it mean? It's my anniversary. Okay. Why would you bring that up now, Jesse? I didn't. I mean... I'm sorry, Rose. I... was trying to find out if Butler was working on anything. Well, he wasn't given to sharing. He was even worse than you. Did he seem... Preoccupied? Yes. He even shut his office door sometimes before he made a phone call. Maybe he was calling home. No, he didn't shut his door like he was calling home. Is that helpful? It is. Is that why you called? Don't shrug. I called to talk to you. You could've told me you were leaving. The phone works both ways, Jesse. So why are you calling now? I called now because... Why is this so hard? I called now because I miss you. I'm sorry that I lost touch, Jesse. Well, it's hard to keep in touch with someone who doesn't want to be found. You gonna come home? I hope I can. I hope you will. Bye, Jesse. Come back to Paradise, Rose. Figured it out yet? I'm the State Homicide commander, not God. I thought they were the same thing. Think how disappointed I am. "It's an ongoing investigation. All I can say at this point is, we cannot rule out foul play." Nice. I thought it was appropriately obtuse. "I have nothing more to say at this time." Now, you, you could have been a little more eloquent? Have you ever known me to be eloquent? Not hardly. So we bought a little time. Very little. How much was in the duffle bag? We reckon about $100,000. And the powder was heroin. High-end smack. What's that tell you? Butler was dirty. Or somebody set him up. You never liked him. I don't think I ever said that. Oh, yes, you did. A cop deserves the benefit of the doubt. Well, I can see the heroin, but to burn up $100,000 on a setup... No, he was dirty. If he was dirty, who killed him? A rival or the guys he was working with. If you blow up a cop, it makes news. Why not make it look like an accident? Somebody had a grudge. Or somebody set him up. If the guys he was working with wanted to kill him, they wouldn't burn the money. Yeah, but if it was a rival, how would he know he was blowing up the money? And if Butler was a good cop who was onto something, you'd burn a hundred grand just to make him look dirty. I don't deal in ifs. I deal in certainty. Well, it's certain a hundred grand's a lot of money to burn. Whose case is this, yours or mine? Both. Who defers to who? It is State Homicide's policy to defer to local authorities. Good. It's State Homicide's policy to defer to local authorities when it is appropriate and effective. Okay. So, other than the fact that you think he's clean, what do you know so far, Chief Stone? Nothing. The explosion was caused by... An I.E.D. I thought you didn't know anything. Knowing and supposing are two different things. We've identified five veterans, all with experience in explosives, all with criminal records, all who live in the vicinity. That's good police work, Captain Healy. We were able to run down four, but the fifth one-- Thompson-- he's closer to you. So you're deferring to local authority. I am... in this instance. What's with the hat? You got your job back. I sensed that you did. Did you now? Actually, I read the paper. What was he doing on the beach road? He got a complaint. It was obviously bogus. The caller knew exactly what to say and not to say to get 'em to show up. Butler would know that. Still got to be checked out. He would do that? Got him killed. You didn't like him. I don't think I ever said that. Yes, you did, Jesse. You going out? A couple of days. Got to shake down some new equipment, come back in, then the Grand Banks. Be careful out there. You come here to tell me that? I did not. He had a kid. He did. Rose quit. She did last week. Because of Butler? The divorce. She had to sell the house. She left town. My sense is, she'd go to her mom's in Toledo. She went to her mom's in Toledo. We lost touch. We did. You're a good cop, Suitcase. So are you, Jesse. It's important that you remember that. You'll find out who did this. Something's going to happen on the 24th. Besides that. My cop-ly intuition is a little rusty. "2A-H-10." It'll happen at 2:00 in the morning. My sense is that ten would designate a sum of money. You got a feeling. Donuts are cop-ly. Cast off, Luther. Okay, Dad. I can't go back, Jesse. I was born into this life. This is where I belong. Mr. Thompson? Hello? Mr. Thompson, police. Herb, my medical examiner needs to be brought up to speed. Thank you, Jesse. Chief Stone. I was on my way home, so... What happens to the dog? Animal Control will take care of it. I hear your... your medical examiner is also your town pediatrician. His heart and gut are in the right place. That's all that matters to you? That's about it. You just put down your dog. Maybe you should take him home. Sir, found this. Hmm. Yeah, good. So, what do you think? About the dog? I think it looks like he hung himself. I think he hung himself. Not the same thing. ("Save Your Love for Me" playing) Wish I knew Why I'm so in love with you  No one else in this world will do  Darling, save your love For me Run away If I were wise I would run away But like a fool in love I stay And pray you'll save your love for me. Guy lives alone away from other people. Only companion was a dog. Now that can be toxic. Reggie's not my dog. I was talking about the deceased. This is the best drink I've had since I was shot. It's the only drink you've had since you were shot. It's too easy. Some cases are hard. And some are easy; I know the speech. Okay. Thompson was a junkie. Small-time seller. Who was he working for? Got his knowledge from the military. And with the bomb-making stuff and the cell phone detonator in the cellar, I think we got a slam dunk. It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself. Who'd he work for last time he was busted? We think it was Gino Fish. Okay. Does this mean anything to you? No, is that a clue? No, it's my laundry list. That's not funny. The guy made the bomb; he killed the chief. Like I said. And somebody killed him. Who? Whoever set him up. You're an addict; you get a big payday. Next morning you're full of smack and cooling out, but you manage to fight through it and conjure up enough remorse to hang yourself. You're making my head hurt. A cop deserves the benefit of the doubt. Wife's waitin'. Think about the dog. I can't do a thing, I'm so in love with you. So darling, help me please Have mercy on a Fool like me I know I'm lost but still I plead Darling, please save your love for me. You can have fun in a crowd But for crying out loud Darling, please save your love for me. Lonely place. It is. No one knows. I don't want to piss off my ex. I use to do that. So you said. But you're still in love with her. I am. Must make it hard to commit to another woman. Not for the short term. Never met a man who couldn't commit for the short term. Most men wouldn't have told me about the ex-wife. So they could get you into bed. So they could get me into bed. That doesn't mean I don't want to. Don't get your hopes up. My hopes are always up. Do I have to call you Chief now? Only when you feel so moved. I'm sleeping with a cop. You've always been sleeping with a cop. I just wasn't getting paid for it. Does anyone know? Yes. Who would that be? Your roommate knows. He won't talk. Do you have time for sex? If we hurry. You never hurry. I have a job now. I have to close the place. I have to open the station early. That's sad. What are you looking at? I'm breaking the law. You're driving and talking on your cell phone. It's okay. I'm the police chief. It occurred to me Butler used a computer. It was in the cruiser. Not much left of it. One of my college guys managed to retrieve some of his e-mails. How do they do that? I have no idea. So far, none of the e-mails show anything incriminating or exculpatory. Can you keep a lid on this till the 24th? Why? Because something's gonna happen on the 24th. Is that a guess? No, it's a hunch. You see a difference? A hunch is a guess that has certainty. Jesse, you can't suppose yourself into certainty. I would disagree. You said the guy who hanged himself might have worked for Gino Fish. Gino didn't do this. How do you know? 'Cause he's too smart to kill a cop, and it's not his style. Is that a guess? No, that's a hunch. License and registration, please. May I go in the glove box? You may. Arthur Gallery. I prefer Art. Okay. Why have you stopped me, Officer? I prefer Chief, and you were speeding, Art. I was not speeding, Chief. Sure you were. I was speeding, and you were following me. You were also following me on the turnpike yesterday. Would you step out of the car, please. Put your hands on the hood of the car. Why do I think you know this routine? You have no probable cause, okay? This is my town. There's no dash cam in the cruiser to protect you so you can toy with the Constitution. What, no clever response? If you're armed, you best tell me now. If you don't and I find a piece, I'll just throw it on the seat, and say I saw it there. I'm not armed. Okay. You're not going to search me? I just did. What's in the trunk? You have no probable cause, Chief. Arthur, please don't make me start over. It's my deer rifle. What's the light for, Arthur? You can't hunt at night. Where's the magazine? It's in a separate pouch, okay? Is the magazine loaded? Yes, it is, Chief. Congratulations, Arthur. You just passed the state test. So, how long do think it would take you to grab the loaded magazine, insert it in your rifle, chamber a round and be ready for the next deer... or whatever? I haven't timed it. I think you have. You're free to go, Arthur. Drive carefully. You're not gonna issue a citation for speeding, Chief? I am not. I'm going to give you a warning instead. Don't follow me around. Have you talked to your ex-wife? I'm trying not to. I didn't ask you that. Have you talked to Jenn? I haven't talked to Jenn since before I lost my job. Is that a good thing? Too soon to tell. Are you drinking? I always drink. Are you drinking a lot? Probably less than if I'd been talking to Jenn. So, that's a good thing. I didn't say that. No, I said that. Why is this so hard? You come to me for help, and then you fight me. It's my nickel. I don't want to make it too easy. You are a subversive son of a bitch. I guess if I'm drinking less, that would be a good thing. Well, there's a breakthrough, sort of. Are you seeing anyone? I'm seeing you. I have been seeing someone. Is that a good thing? Yes. It helped me stay together after I lost my job. We've become pals who have sex. Do you like her? I do. Women usually want more. Oh, she's more afraid of commitment than I am. Okay. I'm paying you 180 bucks an hour, right? That's correct. Our breakthrough came too early. Put on your cop hat. Be careful with that. I'm hoping it's a clue. Obviously some kind of code. Whoever wrote it wanted to keep this information a secret. Butler wrote it. One always reads backwards on notes of this nature. How do you know that? Do you my cop-ly opinion or not? I do. I used to do this kind of work for a living. H-10 probably means a location, or a name and a location. What's that mean? "H-10 is probably a location, or a name and a location?" Which is it? I don't know. What's it say to you? I think it says Butler was onto something, and it got him and DeAngelo killed. Well, thinking's not good enough. I'm a hunch guy, not an evidence guy. If my gut gives me certainty, that's all I need. Convictions are based on evidence. I don't care about convictions. I care about justice. Morning, Thelma. Morning, Jesse. You called me. Did you see what she is wearing? Who? Thelma. I'm obsessed with her. What about Cissy? Oh, I'm trying to move on from my ex-wife. As am I. What does that mean? It means I am trying to move on from my ex-wife, also. Oh. Yeah. I was hoping you could fix me up. With Thelma? That would assume she wants to go out with you. You know the only reason that she works here selling cars is so she can sing in a club at night. Do you think I should go down there? I wouldn't do that, Hasty. No, you're right. She'll think I'm coming on too strong. Might even consider it sexual harassment. No, I think what I'm gonna do is, I am gonna sit back, I am gonna bide my time, play it cool. Why do you do that? It's who I am. So, do you think he was mixed up in something illegal? That's the second time you've said that. And could you turn that thing off? Come on, Jesse. The way he was killed makes it look like he was mixed up in something. Exactly. It makes it look like he was mixed up in something. Clearly, State Homicide is holding back information. Carter Hansen said the same thing. They always hold back information. Well, what do you know? Okay, what I know is that Hansen's gonna get rid of you, Jesse, as soon as he finds somebody else. I do not have a problem with Hansen, nor he me. How'd you know? What? About the bombing. He said you already knew. Why would State Homicide call you and not the rest of the town council? No, they didn't. Look, Hansen was in shock. All I knew was that something was wrong as soon as I heard his voice. No, he's just confused. I'm sorry, Hasty. It's just the cop in me. He's pretty beat up by this. Was Butler working on something? Nothing I can find. Does 2A-H-10 mean anything to? It just sounds like some kind of code. He-He was very secretive. In fact, he was worse than you. Now, I can help you with his laptop. I know you're computer- illiterate. I prefer Luddite, and it was destroyed in the explosion. That's a serious blow to the investigation. Look, I know I owe you, Hasty. You gave me the job in the first place. So, here's what I can tell you. I'm the only cop who thinks he wasn't dirty. The killer knew that Butler was going to be on the Beach Road and where he was going. Someone's following me around. And something's gonna happen on the 24th. What's going to happen on the 24th? That is something I do not know. I can help you with this. I'm very fond of you, Jesse. Hello, Amanda. Hello, Jesse. You remembered my name. You're on the list. Your list? Mr. Fish's list. Can I ask you something? Do I have a choice? You called me by my first name. That's not a question. That's not a question, Jesse. Jesse. I know that's not a question, Amanda. What was your question? Jesse. What was your question, Jesse? I know you're shy and afraid to break the ice, so I'll start. Could I see you sometime? No. I see. Actually, that was only part of my question. I'm sorry. Was I rude? No. You were direct. I like direct. Can I see you sometime, and would you walk over to that door and punch me in? Because? Because I like watching you. I'm too young for you. I'm hurt. Just coffee. Where are you taking me, Steven? You came to see Mr. Fish? That's correct. I'm taking you to see Mr. Fish. Is he in an underground bunker? I hardly think so. You don't like me, do you, Steven? I do not. Wait here. Jesse. Wait here, Jesse. Jesse Stone to see you, sir. Jesse Stone. Hello, Gino. Oh, I see your PPD hat has found its way back onto your head. This is H. Henry Uppman, an associate. Jesse Stone is from Paradise. He's the temp police chief. Just chief. Oh, congratulations. Thank you. Obviously, I heard about your former chief. It was a horrible tragedy. His name was William Butler, and he was murdered. I see. Is that why you're here? Well, we haven't visited in a while. And I've missed our little chats. I'm sorry. I was busy. Doing what, Jesse Stone? Being preoccupied. And why are you wearing the hat, Jesse Stone? Because I missed it. I'm afraid I have more sad news, Gino. Would you remember a former employee named James Thompson? I know of no such person. Perhaps you remember him as Jimmy. I know of no such person. Why do you ask? Jimmy hanged himself yesterday. How sad. So, this is an official visit? In a let's-get-reacquainted sort of way. Mr. Fish will not be answering any more of your questions. How sad. It was nice seeing you again, Jesse Stone. Some kids have started a bonfire out on the point, okay? I'm worried about my house. Some kids have started a bonfire out on the point, okay? I'm worried about my house. ...okay? I'm worried about my house. What were you thinking? Excuse me? What were you thinking when you asked me out? I didn't ask you out. I asked if I could see you sometime. And the difference would be? Rules. Excuse me? The rules between a meeting and a date are different. And this would be...? This would be a meeting. I'm too young for you. You mean I'm too old for you. Not necessarily. That was kind. I didn't mean it to be. It was direct. I see. No, you don't. Okay. I'm not ready. I see. Don't keep saying that-- because you don't see. Okay. The idea has always appealed to me. I see. I do see. You're not ready. Amanda, what's gonna happen on the 24th? Nothing, Jesse. I have no plans. Okay. So, why did you ask me out? Why do you want to know? Because I've kissed a few frogs in my day. I see. You make me curious. About...? About you. Good. I like curious. So, do you like working in the field of boxing? Yes. I like men. Okay. Is that all you do for Mr. Fish? I'm his executive assistant. In the boxing business? In the boxing business. Must be nice working for the boss. It is. Although Mr. Fish has a boss. Mr. Fish has a boss? I just said that. And who would the boss be? I don't know. I've never seen him. Clearly, this isn't about me. What happens on the 24th? I don't know. You don't know or you won't tell me? Does Gino Fish have a boss? He's the sole owner of GF Boxing Promotions, and he runs the show on his dark side, and he didn't do it. Is that a guess or a hunch? He has an ironclad alibi. What'd he say? He didn't. His lawyer informed us. H. Henry Uppman. He's highly skilled in the art of criminal defense. Guy's a putz. Because? Because he used to be a prosecutor, and now he's a criminal defense attorney. Did you pay Gino a visit? I did. My college boys are getting nowhere with the laptop. I think it's a total loss. I know he was on to something. What? Is this a hunch? I got to make something happen. Whose investigation is this, Jesse? I'm not sure that was ever decided. We're gonna go public with some of this in the morning. Maybe somebody'll step forward. I asked you to wait. I never said I would, or could. Guy's got a family. I know that. I was right: you never hurry. You sing like an angel. Mm. Thank you, Jesse. You're way overqualified for that joint. They let me sing. You ever want to wear that underwear again in front of a grown man, I'm your guy. You're different now that you have your job back. Is that a good thing? Ever since I've known you, there was a part of you that wasn't present. And now? There's a smaller part. You love being a cop. I do. Why'd you come to Paradise? You haven't asked me that before? I'm not cruel. No, you're not. Could be hurtful to ask a cop who can't be a cop why he became the Paradise police chief. But you're curious? You make me curious. Paradise was my last stop. From? I got fired in L.A. For? Being drunk on the job. Your boss hired me. Thought you put him in prison. I did. He assumed that with my history, I'd be manageable. But you're not. No, I'm not. His ex-wife's a real piece of work. I have found that to be true. She took him for everything. How'd he get the money to start a used car business? That is a question for which I do not have the answer, and he is not forthcoming when I mention it. Does he ever tell you he's very fond of you? Only when he needs something. This wasn't easy to get under the conditions you specified. That no one knew you were getting it? Exactly. Do you want to know why I wanted it? No. Because...? You said don't ask. I want to say something, and I don't want to scare you. Fire away. You helped me through the hardest time in my life. I was thinking of stopping by. You gonna be around later? Good. Yes, the car's in great condition. It hasn't been in any accidents. That's right. And the mileage is very low. Only 23,867. And the original owner... Congratulations, Jesse, you actually made an appointment. Thelma's in particularly fine form today. We need to talk, Hasty. Jesse, you cannot afford one of my cars. Oh. Sit down. So... what's gonna happen on the 24th? I thought getting my job back would straighten me out. How is the drinking thing? I got wasted last night. Are you getting help? I'm not about to see a shrink. Well, is there someone you can talk to or confide in? I think you just got elected. Oh. I've been a cop for a long time, Hasty, and my gut's always served me, but... I have to apologize. For what? I'm just not... thinking right. You know, you were so persistent about wanting to know what I know, and you've never told me how you got the money for this place. You take two small unrelated things, find your dinner in a bottle of scotch, and look what you get. What do you get? Well, somewhere around my third drink, I had it all figured out. When I busted you, you weren't laundering money for Gino Fish. You just pled to it to cover up something bigger. Did you keep drinking? I did. And? The more I drank, the more it made sense. You weren't working for Gino; he was working for you. You were the boss. You ran the narcotics operation, even from prison. And I felt it with such certainty. And in the morning? All I felt was a headache. That's when I called you. Why are you telling me all this? I owe you, Hasty. Look, i-it was a crazy idea, but, I don't know, somehow... it made me feel... disloyal. Oh. So for what it's worth, I'm sorry. I'm very fond of you, Jesse. Thank you. I think I know where this came from. Where would that be? Well, I couldn't face the fact that a fellow cop was dirty, that his drug deal went bad, he knew too much, so... Yeah. You've had a rough time. Anyway... thanks for listening. Oh, good news. State Homicide thinks they found a way into Butler's computer. They should have everything by this evening. I guess... it'll incriminate Butler. It's gonna be hard on his family. Yeah. I'll walk you out. Wait a minute. Uh, Thelma-- come here-- you remember Jesse? I do. Thelma is in the process of closing a very big deal, a Bentley Continental. Sweet! Thanks, Hasty. Nice seeing you, Thelma. And you, Jesse. I'm very fond of him. We got to move it up. I know I'm not speaking in a foreign tongue. The 24th is a no-go. Um, 6:00 tonight. No, I know that daylight is a risk, but risk is the price you pay for opportunity, my friend. No, I don't want you to tell them that. Just tell them to be there. Let me get that for you, Mr. Hathaway. No, this stays with me. Thank you, Hal. Will you be leaving us for long, sir? Just a couple of days. A lot of luggage. Yeah, well, if my business gets complicated I may need to extend my stay. I would remind you that it's... none of your business, Hal. Thank you, sir. I told you it wasn't Gino. I told you it wasn't Butler. The deceased shooter, Arthur Gallery, had no priors. But he was a person of interest in three separate murders in three different locations. Now I could've told you all this if you'd given me a name. All I had was a traffic stop. You could've called me sooner. I wasn't sure what I had. Besides, your people got there in a timely fashion. So what pushed you to Hasty? Maintenance records on the cruiser. Hasty's shop pulled maintenance on Butler's cruiser two days prior. So you used, uh... what do you call it? Carefully applied pressure. From day one, he always assumed he was smarter than me. So you knew he planted the money. I had a hunch. So in Jesse's world there was certainty. No. But when I saw his eyes, there was. No word on Hasty. From day one, I always assumed I was smarter than him. He's a resourceful son of a bitch. He'll turn up. If you say so. Changed my mind.
