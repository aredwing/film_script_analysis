Is there someone with the courage... to step forward? But I fear for him... as I fear for us. Ryan! Breakfast is on the table. I've gotta run, honey. Be back around 5:00. Bye. Shoot. Bravo, no. Look, where's Ryan? Go on. You go find him. Make sure he eats his breakfast. Yeah. What? Do you mind? Dog. Yeah. - Hey, Ryan! - Yeah? To your right. Have I told you about the real kung fu masters? Then let go of your limitations. Imagine a world beyond anything you've ever seen. A world of no worries, of perfect bliss, where anything can happen. A world defended by great warriors. No guns, no lasers, no morphing. They use the forces of nature as their weapons. Fire, metal... wood... water... and earth. Warriors who fight for integrity and honor... sail upon their enemies with the grace of a dancer... and knock them senseless... with the touch of a feather. Well, it's cooking time. Hey, Ming. Are they real? Ancient Chinese secret. Red for 12! Set, hut! - Go! - Go, Ken! - We can still win. - There's no way they can make it. Time out! - Red team. - Ryan, Chucky, today! Coming, Coach. - Guys, we have time for one more play. - Here you go. We're gonna sweep left. No, we're gonna sweep right. Toby, you get the ball. No way, Coach. Left tackle's been bustin' through the line all game. Hey, I've played a few games in my day, son. Okay? I said sweep right, so we're gonna sweep right. Now let's go! - We can do it. - Yeah, it's a good play. - Brad. - Guys, throw 'em over here. Thanks. Their right safety comes in on every running play. If you fake to Toby, then bootleg left, you have a clear path to the end zone. Sure, "Coach. " All right. Ready! - Break! - Gimp! Let's go, Ry. Blue 42! Go! Hut! All right! Way to go! Wow! Yes! All right! Nice call. Thanks, Chucky. You got dissed, man. It was your call. What's the difference? You. That's the whole point. - You made the difference. - Watch out! Hey, we're walkin' here! Hey, Brad! Ryan called your winning play. Aren't you gonna thank him? Did you say somethin', or did you fart? Ryan called the play. You heard him. And he told you exactly what to do. Oh, really? I thought you said that was your ingenious idea. Bootleg left, clear path to the end zone. - That was a great call, man. - Thanks. Too bad you can't play ball. You're pretty smart. Come on. Let's get lost. Wait a second. You want to hang out with us tonight? - Yeah. Sure. - Cool. Well, we'll be around the Orono tunnel about 8:00. - Great. We'll be there. - All right. You too, Upchuck. Break. You got a death wish, man? I mean, the guy's evil. Lucifer thinks he's a little extreme. - He's up to somethin'. - So you're not comin'? I didn't say that. After all, you're the man. See you there. Pass! Touchdown! An incredible pass from the man simply known as... "Ry. " - Darn. - Hey, Mom. The man I was looking for. Dinner's almost served. Fabulous frozen. Got a showing in 20 minutes, so you'll have to eat alone. - How was your game? - We won. Brad got a touchdown on the last play. - I came up with the play. - Really? Hey, that's great. I'm very proud of you. Proud of what? I didn't score the touchdown. That's okay. - Yeah, right. - No, it is. You're a part of that team. And it sounds to me like they couldn't have won without you. When's Dad getting back? Now, are you saying that your father is a better cook than your mother? No offense. Oh, yes, you are gonna need something. - How about Min's? My treat. - Ming, Mom. You've only been there a hundred times. Yeah, Ming. I know. Look, your mama's losing her mind, going in and out of that door all day long. You bear with me a little longer? I'll be back in a couple hours. Sorry. Look, I'm sorry, okay? You okay, Mr. Lang? It's slippery here. You gotta watch your step. - What's goin' on? - Oh, nothin'. Come on. - What's got you singin' the blues? - Nothin'. Come on. I got somethin' for you. - What is it? - Come on. I'll be right there. What's this? Oh, I found that when I was about your age. It's a cocoon. I was on my way home from school. I saw it lying on the ground, just sitting there... moving around, something inside. I got on my hands and knees and looked close... and I see this moth struggling to get out. But he couldn't do it. So I reached down and tore open the cocoon. And out he came. Takes off into the air and flies away. But then, all of a sudden, down he came into the ground. Dead. What happened? I interrupted his journey. We all have cocoons. The struggle to free ourselves makes us whole and gives us the strength to fly. It's pretty hard to fly when you have a broken wing. Always so certain of that, aren't you? Ancient Chinese secret, remember? - A book? - No, a manuscript. I was like you once. Never felt I was good enough. Always wanted to be like someone else. But this... this helped me become the person I wanted to be. A cook? No. Myself. This is Tao. It means the way to something, yourself, being the person you want to be. I got all the self-help books I need from my mom. She doesn't get it either. This isn't like the books your mom gave you. I gotta go. Check it out. - It's yours. - Catch you later. Man, this place makes me itch. - This is creepy. Let's get outta here. - What? This is our ticket, so don't blow it. We're in. So you boys decided to show up. So what are we gonna do here? We're gonna play follow the leader. You're the leader. - It's a bad idea. - Just relax, okay? No. See? I told you somethin' was up. And I bet it's gonna get worse. I bet they're gonna carve their initials into our chest... or make hot dogs out of our wieners. - Hot dogs with meatballs on the side. - Shut up. Me, oh, my. You know, I just remembered, I have a Spanish test tomorrow. To hang with us, you gotta be initiated. Come on, you wussies! Let's go! - All right, guys. - Wait. All right. Now, this is simple. All you gotta do is walk across and give us an autograph. - Make your mark. - You said you wouldn't make him do it. He can't. - Don't listen to him. - We all did it. You want in? It's up to you. - Don't. - He's a wussy. - Don't do it. - Don't. Fine. I'll meet you on the other side. - Baby! - All right, man. Come on! Take a swim today? Shut up! - Watch out. - Don't slip, man. - Watch it! - Yeah! Come on! Yeah! Come on, Jeffers. Are you cool? Let's go. Come on, buddy. Come on. He's just making fun of you. Man, this is stupid. Make like Tom and "cruise. " Shut up. I can do this, okay? Look, he did it. Yeah. But you're not him. - Damn. - Let's go! - He's picking up the can. - Are you afraid? - Come on! - Come on down. - Don't do it! - Shut up. - Come on. You got it. - You got it. Keep goin'. You guys, don't distract him. - He's gonna fall in! - Hey, big guy, you got it. Come on. Come on! You got it. What are you doing? Go for it! You're movin' like a baby! Why don't you just get down and crawl? Come on! - Stop it! - Come on. Come on! You got it! - Don't look down! - That's it. Yes! Hey, you see that? - What? - He's freakin'. You never know when it's gonna take a dump. You gotta be quick. Come on! Let's go. You gotta be quick. Come on! What is that? Grab him! - Oh, my God! - Get him out! What... Dry? Tracy? Come on, guys. Cut it out. Look, this isn't funny. Bravo! Hey, you! Gotcha! Oh, my God. It works. My leg. It works. It works! Yes! Set! Blue 42! Set! Hike! Jeffers spins past the defenders! Oh, he cuts back, spinning, stiff-arming! Back to the sidelines. He goes. He's spinning past the defenders. Split the stiff-arm! Spins again. Fumble! But Jeffers recovers. He spins back to mid-field. At the ten! The five... - Get off me! - You're not getting away, Newcomer! - Let go! No! - No such luck. Let go, punk. Hold your blade! Who's there? - Are you hurt? - He's a Newcomer, Elysia. Came right up out of the river. I saw it with my own eyes. And he's mine! You're really a Newcomer? I just fell in the water. I slipped, and then those things... they came out, and they tried to kill me. Those were Komodo's men. We're not safe here. Come on. Elysia, a little reward for my efforts? Virtue be yours! Your patrol was sent to spy on their Lifespring, Commander. - You were not supposed to be seen. - General, we were attacked. Well, you can explain it to him yourself. He's not happy. Bye-bye! Commander. Failure... is in your eyes. An open wound infects like a disease... and it spreads... like an infection. I smell fear. Fear of what? Death? My lord... please. Look. I brought you this. It's from a boy. He's a Newcomer. Newcomer? Rise. Slowly stand up. Don't be afraid. I want to take away your terror. There is nothing to fear... because... nothing dies. Listen. Life... is but a dream... flowing into another dream. Bye. General Grillo... I ask you this: What's the point of power... if you don't abuse people? Open it. My lord, it's the symbol of Tao! Could this be the... the manuscript? Lieutenants! At last. Find this Newcomer and bring him to me. Pleasure, my lord. Alive. Who are you? Where am I? I'm Elysia. You're in Tao. - Tao? - Yes, Tao. The manuscript. I thought it was just a story. I didn't believe him. What manuscript? What does it look like? - That. It has that on the cover. - The Manuscript of Legend? - The what? - The Manuscript of Legend. Master Chung once told us about an ancient book that had special powers. He said, if it was ever returned to Tao, it could change everything. - Who's Master Chung? - He's our leader. When he came to Tao, he taught ways of peace and harmony. But it didn't last. Komodo began mining the Lifespring for a mineral called zubrium. The Lifesprings are where we live. They radiate energy to all of Tao. Without zubrium they die out. Komodo uses the zubrium to keep himself young and strong. That's why he's so desperate for it. Now only one Lifespring remains. Can't anyone stop him? No, not even the Warriors of Virtue. Warriors? Kung fu? What do they look like? They're Rooz. This is our Lifespring. Listen to me, citizens of Tao. Please calm yourselves. - We cannot let our fears defeat us. - We must remain calm. The Warriors of Virtue will protect us! But Master Chung, has Yun returned? He has not. Then how can the Warriors of Virtue protect us... if there are only four of them? Komodo's soldiers have already been spotted inside the green. - What are we going to do? - We're doomed! Oh, we're dead! Listen to me, please! Master Chung, we have hope. - A Newcomer has arrived. - Newcomer? He's too small to be a Newcomer. Houston, we have a problem. Newcomer, Elysia said you have brought the manuscript. May I see it? It is important, Newcomer. The name is Ryan Jeffers. Show me the Warriors of Virtue, please? I trained these five warriors to protect Tao. Each upholds honor... and integrity. Do they fight with kung fu? They use the force of nature's elements: Wood, fire... earth, metal... and water. Ming was right. This is Lai, virtue of order... the stability of wood. Meticulous, logical... often a bit cranky. Tsun, the virtue of loyalty... security of earth. Kind and nurturing. Chi, virtue of high wisdom... power of fire. Often playful... but very wise. Yee, virtue of righteousness... strength of metal. He does not speak, seeing every choice as right or wrong. - Nothing in between. - You said there were five. Yes. The other is Yun... their leader. Virtue of benevolence, force of water. Where is he? Yun has lost his will to fight. God, they're so cool. Uh-oh. But not ready! Don't be afraid. This is Yee. Ryan. How's it goin'? It's all right. This is Chi... Tsun... and Lai. He is a Newcomer, and he has brought something important to us. Now, Ryan Jeffers, may we see the manuscript? Look, I don't have it. One of you guys has it. Us? When you saved me from Komodo's soldiers, it was in my backpack. - At the river. Remember? - Backpack? What's a backpack? Yun knows where it is. If the Newcomer was saved at the river, it would have been Yun. - Forget Yun. - But what if he can help? Yun does not care about our cause anymore. He will not help. In this struggle, all five of you must work together. We must find Yun. Without the Manuscript of Legend... we cannot defeat Komodo. What are you thinking about? Home. I wonder if my mom and dad are worried about me. What are your parents like? I don't know. No. They're pretty cool. I mean, they're nice. I wish I'd known my mother and father. They died just after my brother and I were born. Master Chung looked after us. Where is your brother? He was recently killed. I'm sorry. You must've been a great leader in your world to be trusted... with the Manuscript of Legend. Not really. I was just a bad follower. - But I'd sure like to show them now. - Show them what? That I can run, play football... just like everyone else! What? Nothing. I just think I found a friend. So have I. Come on. There's something I want to show you. - What? - Come on! All this was built in honor of the Rooz. During the Old Order, they were revered by everyone. - How come Yee doesn't talk? - He used to. But after the war in Tao started... he saw so much suffering that he hasn't spoken since. Why'd Yun leave everyone? - He killed someone in the battle. - So what? It was a battle. People die. It was a life! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. It's just that the Warriors of Virtue made a creed never to kill. But Yun... Someday you'll understand. Understand what? You remind me of my brother. He's alway... Let go of me! - What are you doing? - Shut up! - Move it. - Help! Help! - Hey, Yun. - Let go! Come to play? Where's your sword? You killed anyone today? Mantose! Get up! Barbra-Rotious, this way! You're Yun, aren't you? I'm Ryan, the Newcomer. You saved me at the river, remember? Can I have the manuscript? I need to bring it back to them. The Manuscript of Legend? You mean, you don't have it? Then Komodo must have it. You have to help them get it back. Master Chung says they need you. Come on. Let's go. You don't understand. Where are you going? You're supposed to be one of them! Honor! Integrity! Remember? You can't run away forever! No wonder they gave up on you. Wimp! Lai was right. He doesn't care. - Let's go. - Cool. It can't be. Irrational. Cool. Thank you, Ryan. Tsun, I... I knew you'd return. - Thanks. - There was always wisdom in your heart. Welcome home. You should not have left. Order has been disrupted. I was wrong. The Newcomer helped me realize that. Come on. It is good you've returned. Thank you. Tell them about the manuscript. Komodo has it. We will never stop Komodo now. Its knowledge is his. That's not so. It's good to see all of you together again. Forgive me. The Newcomer brought the manuscript. He is the only one with the eyes to see what is written. Me? Master, on my life, I will get the manuscript back from Komodo. Yun is back! The Warriors of Virtue are united again! Thank you, Ryan! My lord, all the zubrium has been mined from this Lifespring. The army stands at readiness. The only question is, what do we do since Yun has returned? Do not think thoughts. The Rooz were born to die. Even reunited, they cannot defeat me. Isn't that why they seek the manuscript? Yes, it is. - My lord, forgive... - Do not... think thoughts. Outside, anxiety exists. And where there is anxiety... there is error. And where there is error... there is opportunity. They're panicking! Do not think thoughts! Let them make their mistake. Forgive me, my lord... but if the manuscript can harm us, why don't we just destroy it? It cannot be destroyed. You can be destroyed. Your armies can be destroyed. But it cannot be destroyed! Get out. Get away from me! General Grillo. My lord? Can I survive when I have destroyed the last Lifespring in Tao? And do you expect me to stay in a world where I cannot survive? No, my lord. Another world is waiting. The manuscript... will help us to get to this other world. Then why do we need the Newcomer? Well, because he is the teller of tales. And I do not see failure in your eyes. The Newcomer shall be yours, my lord. General. Do... Does purple suit me? Very much, my lord. Then you are dismissed. I don't like it. We should tell Master Chung what we're doing. - There's no time. - Just listen to what she's saying. But Komodo can attack us at any time. - He said to be patient. - Patience is not my virtue. If all of us go, there will be chaos. And I made a pledge to protect these people. We can't leave them defenseless. I let the manuscript fall into Komodo's hands... and I made a pledge to Master Chung. I will go myself. - I'll go with you too. - What about me? Master Chung says I'm the only one who can read the manuscript. That would be unwise. What did he say? Yee said we must keep you from harm. You're a friend. Relax. It's just a cool way to shake hands. Okay. You're gettin' it. You got it. All right. Good luck. Thank you, Mosely. Do I look like a baby-sitter? The next time, why don't you volunteer to get us something to eat? Your stupid ideas. If I hear one more thing come out of your mouth... Your breath stinks. Never mind. My lord, Elysia is here. Your guilt is obscene. It was a life! Yield to vengeance. Medication time. - The Newcomer has taken a liking to you. - Yes. And you care for him. - He has fallen under my spell. - A wicked spell it is. What are you afraid of? - Not you. - That's my girl. Oh, yes. I wouldn't touch that if I were you. That's Yun's sword. Nobody touches Yun's sword. Not even Yun, anymore. Know what I mean? You again. What do you want? I've got a deal for you, Newcomer. - I've got something you want. - What? I'm not telling until I get something in return. - Tell me now, partner. - Take it easy. Whoa! I'll tell you. I've got the manuscript. You what? Stole it right out from under Komodo's nose. - Show it to me. - Are you crazy? It's hid, hid where no one's gonna find it but me. But I'll take you there. I have to tell them. You're not listenin' to me. The manuscript's not theirs. It's yours. Look, once they use up all the power, how are you gonna get home? You wanna stay here forever? Never see your family, friends? Ever? Now, take it from me, Newcomer. It's now or never. No. Look, I can't leave them. They need me here. Fine. You're not interested? I'll ask someone else. Mudlap. Wait. A small reward for my efforts. It's a good watch. Well, it's better than nothin'. Come on. Hey, wait up! Where are we? - Let go! - Welcome to the other side. - Thanks, General Grillo. - Jerk! - Virtue be yours. - Let go! Let go of my arm! My arm, you punk! Let go! That is not your way. Komodo's lies have blinded your vision. But the truth is still there. In your heart. The manuscript. It's too easy. What? Hmm? Protectors of Tao, weak... vulnerable. What are you doing here? Oh, are you really that surprised, Yun? Virtue of Benevolence who kills? - It was an accident! - Enjoy your restitution. Please, Elysia. Don't let him destroy our Lifespring. I should have listened to Tsun. Rooz! Thank you for hanging around. I have concocted a recipe... for kangaroo stew. First... simply chop the meat into many tiny little pieces... and sprinkle with a hint of benevolence. Don't... Marinate in wisdom for many, many, many years. Add just a touch... of order! And let it simmer... in righteousness. Goes down very well with a... nice cold vial of zubrium. My lord, please! Growl. Roll over. - Beg! - Please! Go away. Komodo, you forgot loyalty. Loyalty... only lasts so long. Then it spoils. Chi... your stupidity astounds me. You come uninvited into my lair... animals that you are. Like animals, I shall serve you up as supper... to my close friend... and most honored guest... ladies and gentlemen... the Newcomer! No! Not Ryan! It was Master Chung. Chung. Ah. - He took the Newcomer from me. - We've got to get out of here. I'll add just a dash of old man to the dish. And I'll enjoy your Lifespring for dessert! Yes! General Grillo. Drink. - Do it. - Hmm? Is it worth it, Grillo? General Grillo! You belong with us, like it was when we were young. You forget, Yun. Even then we played on opposite sides. We were still friends. Drop them! Good boy, General! Chi, give us some light here. Uh-oh. Don't anyone move. Yee, don't panic! Oh, no. Problem. Yee, the ring! Yee, is that a tunnel? Let's get out of here. Forget the ring. Let's go! Don't panic. We've got you! Ready, Chi? On three. One, two... three! Go, go, go! Will the manuscript really get me home? Yes, Ryan. By helping the Rooz... you will find your way home. What about my leg? What matters is not what you gain there... but in your heart. I want it to be strong, like it is now. Do you consider the Warriors of Virtue strong? Yeah. Look at them. Their strength is not in what you see. It is in their virtue. That is their Kung. What's Kung? Kung is your energy... your inner strength. It can be positive or negative. Those like Komodo use negative Kung... to kill and destroy. But if you can bring your virtues together within yourself... you will create positive Kung. With that, you will always have the power... to do the right thing. If no one else can read the manuscript, how will I be able to? The answer lies within you. When I tell you to run, take that path and go. Do not stop until you get to the Lifespring. - Who's that? - It's Komodo. You should go now. Run! Where are you going, Newcomer? Eat this, sucker! Master Chung! Come on! Master Chung, help! I ask you one last time. I am in hell. It's my prison. How can I be free? The only hells in this world... are in your heart... where all the battles must be fought. Get out of here! Are you all right? There are too many of them. We must leave. We've got to get out of here. Stupid Rooz! Oh, no. We shouldn't have left. There's no time for blame, Chi. - We must find the others. - There's only one place still safe. What are you doing here? Ryan, I wanted to tell you. No, you're on his side. - You're a traitor! - No, Ryan. Listen to me, Ryan. Let me explain. No. Master Chung is dead. I saw him die. How can you do this to them? They protected you. Protect with their creed not to kill... ever? Well, they did kill. Yun killed. - It was one of the bad guys. - It was my brother. I don't believe you. You're lying. It's over now. Yun, the others, they're dead. - Komodo killed them. - Shut up! - Just shut up, Elysia! - But it's okay for you. No, it's not. You set me up. You said you were my friend. No, you get to go home, right? Oh, Ryan, please, listen to me. Do what Komodo says. I don't want you to get hurt. Please? Listen... Looking for me? I know your sorrow. I know... your loneliness. Look at me! I am everything you can become. I am... your darkest thoughts, Ryan. And I am proud to be your destiny. No one will ever laugh at you again. I promise you that. Let's go home... with your new leg. Ryan Jeffers... touchdown. Open the book. My lord. The last Lifespring is now completely under our control. But the Rooz have escaped, all of them. Go away. Get out! Read me the book. What does it say? What does it say? Do it, Ryan. Please. Read it to me! Do it. You'll get to go home. Read the words! Shit happens. - Shit... - Happens. Shit happens. You can't read the book, can you? Can you? Komodo, please, give him another chance. You mean nothing to me! No one touches my master. I want him alive! Willy Beest! Mosely! Help! Hey, guys. - All right. - Virtue be yours! Good-bye, Master Chung. I don't want to see it anymore. I don't want to be here. I don't want to see death. I just want to go home. Will this help? Get out of here, creep. Gee, come on, take it. It'll make you feel better. Make me feel better? A watch? Yeah, probably for you. All you care about is your stupid little things and your rewards. You don't know what's important. All you care about is how much you get. Just get out of here. You sold me out. You sold yourself out. Go away. I just want to help. I don't need your help. Get out of here, you two-foot creep! The Rooz need your help. They're at the Temple Ruin. Search harder. - Leave no crevice unexplored. - We've done that already. - Just do it! - Whatever. General Grillo! The manuscript. We have searched everywhere, my lord, but... Then you have not looked everywhere... have you? Find it. - Get out! - Go! I can't help you. I tried to read it, but it's empty. There's nothing. It's empty. I'm sorry. I tried to read it... but I can't. Yee's right. This is our home. Live or die. It's time, Yun. Why not? You've come uninvited into our Lifespring, Komodo. This is our home. We want it back. Warriors... come out and play! What? Where is he? Rooz! Oh, no. Five. Still nothing to say? Then I will be your voice! Lai. The center cannot hold. Things fall apart. You're just illusion, Komodo. Uh-oh. Betrayal... is far more alluring, Tsun. How can I help the Rooz? The answer lies within you, Ryan. Master Chung? Help me. Five is one. Positive Kung. To take a life, you lose a part of yourself. He lost his power. That's it. I am cruelty! Can you stop me, Yun? Are you ready to kill again... Virtue of Benevolence? Eat this! Yun, where is Komodo? What do we do now? Master? Yun, why didn't you listen to me? You act in such haste. The Lifespring is gone. Master, I've failed you. Please, tell me what to do now. Now you can go to hell! No, Yee. He'll break his neck. Hey, Komodo! Looking for this? Remember me? I'm your friend. And I'm proud to be your destiny. Chi, five is one! Positive Kung! Do it now! The medallions! - Water! - Fire! - Wood! - Earth! - Is everyone all right? - Yeah. Yee! Ryan. - Did it work? - Mm-hmm. - It worked. - What's this? I can read the manuscript. Chi. Five is one. Positive Kung. To take a life, you lose a part of yourself. Ryan sacrificed himself to save us. Komodo expended his energy... trying to kill Ryan with negative Kung. It weakened him. You made the difference, Ryan. It gave us time to combine our forces to defeat him. Oh, no! General Grillo, it's over. Join us in peace. It's the only way. Excuse me? Excuse me. - I'm... - Komodo? I'm lost, and could someone please tell me the way? How do I get home? This is your home. The Lifespring is alive! General? Release all the villagers. Thank you. Yee talked. Ryan. Are you in or out, Jeffers? Don't stand there like a dork! Ryan, he's just making fun of you. Man, this is stupid. Let's make like Tom and "cruise. " Why not? I can't believe it! What are you doing? Finally. I'm glad you came to your senses. We got a lot to talk about. Let's get out of here. Jeffers, you'll never make the cut! Pansy ass! Shut up, Brad! Tracy, save it! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Get me out of here! Help! Quick! I don't know. We've gotta help him. What are you looking at, you wussies? Get me out of here! Swim hard, Brad. You think we ought to call 9-1-1? Definitely. How was your night? Virtuous. So how many houses did you sell? Oh, at least 12. We're set for life. Good night, honey. Good night. Mom? I love you. I love you too. "Spread your wings. " Shake. Good boy, Bravo. Hey, Bravo, do you want to hear about Tao? SkyFury
