Prior to your arrival in 2001, had you made any other visits to this country? No. Did your duties as an auto mechanic in any way... necessitate a relocation to the United States? Sorry. Would you please repeat the question? What brought you to this country, Mr. Jarrah? Why are you here? So what brings you to the States? I won the lottery. Well, congratulations, Mr. Jarrah. How long have you been applying for the Green Card Lottery? Twelve years. Well, you're a lucky man. I've never been lucky before. You know, you speak pretty good English. Do you understand me okay? Yes, sir. I will understand more when I go to school here. Okay. Now, I believe I have all of your paperwork, correct? No, I have something very important. One second. That's the congratulation letter. All right, I'll have a look at that. Well, right now we're gonna go over some of the details... so you have a clear understanding of the arrangement, okay? You have been granted a visa through the International Green Card Lottery system. Now that means you'll have an opportunity to become an American citizen. Now, in order to gain citizenship, you're going to have to meet certain eligibility requirements, maintain a good standing with the U.S. government. If you meet all of these requirements, after a period of about five years, well, then, you'll be eligible to take the citizenship test. - Is that understood? - Yes, sir. Now I see here you moved from Beirut, Lebanon, to Aleppo, Syria, - when you were a teenager. - Yes. Why is that? Because of the civil war in Lebanon, you know. So then, why did you move from Syria to Kuwait in 1990? I mean, Kuwait wasn't exactly a peaceful place in the early '90s. Okay. You know, the economy was so bad in Syria, I couldn't find a job, and I found a job in Kuwait. Four months later, Saddam invaded. This is usually how my luck goes. No. But I will find work because I have a business degree. Okay. What about your living arrangements? I'll stay with my cousin, and he's outside waiting for me. - What is your cousin's name? - Rashad. Everything is written down here. Yes, I see it. How did your cousin end up here? Sorry, sir, I don't know this. You don't know? No. Well, I'd like to speak to him. No problem. I go outside, and I bring him here. - All right, that'll be fine. - I go? Yes. Just follow the officer. He'll help you find your cousin. Sorry. I cannot find him. Can I make a phone call, please? - You have reached Rashad. - Please leave a message. Okay, cousin. Okay. Okay, see you tomorrow. Sounds good. Bye-bye. Did you find him? I'm sorry, sir, my information is not right. He's not coming today. He's coming tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes. What about tonight? Actually, he paid for me for a motel to stay till he comes to the city. Okay. Your paperwork... is being processed. You'll find the rest of your luggage out in the hallway. Welcome to America. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry. I don't have an address here. Oh, don't worry. Just fill in the rest. Thanks for calling. Where is he? Thank you. Here's your key. Room 310. Take the elevator to the third floor, make a right, and it's on your right-hand side. Thank you. Goddamn it! This whole time? I just don't get it! You swore that you were done with this shit! Shit! What the hell do you think you're doing? Get back here! Diane! Get in! What? What? What? - Get back here! - Open up! Come out! - Goddamn it! - Get out of here right now! That means now! Who are you and who this crazy man? He's my boyfriend. Go on, get outta here. Get your hands off me, now! Get outta here! You want water? Thank you. Have a seat. Thank you. So... where you from? - I'm from Lebanon. - Like Gadhafi, right? No. Gadhafi means Libya. Okay. So you speak Persian? This would be Iran. Okay, um, welcome to New York. Thank you. Just arrived from overseas. Oh, nice. So, like, fresh off the boat. Boat? No. I came on an aeroplane. Yeah... Yeah. Um... what's your name? Ibrahim. I'm Diane. You want, um... Oh, sure. Thanks. Wow. What is that? Mella... what? Lebanese candy. You like it? Yeah, it's great. I can't get enough of it. Have many as you like. Here. Thanks. You know, I'm gonna go. I'm... sorry. I'll let you get settled. No, no, no, no. Thank you for everything. Just stay for more... few minutes... till we make sure that your friend has left. It's no problem. Have a seat. I don't get it. I mean, I'm a complete stranger to you. Why are you helping me? Because you need help. You know what? My father used to tell me... How can I say it in English? He'd tell me, "Brahim, to reach your dreams plant your good deeds." That's really pretty, but I doubt a strategy like that... is gonna help you in the big city. You might try it one day. Have a seat. No problem. Thanks. So what brings you here? Many things. I want to have a family and have a business, become a citizen. Well, it's America. Anything's possible, right? It's not because it's possible. It's because I decided. Oh. You decided. You know what? Let me... Let me take you on a tour of the city, show you around. You're sure? Now? Yeah, it'll be fun. - Come on. - I would love to. I, um, take my camera? Yeah, bring your camera. Okay. Sorry, room 310, there is no answer. Yeah, would you like to leave a message? Rashad Batar. You're his cousin, right? Wrong airport? You went to Newark? The sun returns the heat Burns the soles of my feet I wasn't trying to escape the sun All I knew was I had to run And so to find some shade I grabbed all that I made The wind is blowing towards the west My heart was beating through my chest Searching for a sky Not too wet, not too dry Wide and open, spacious Free of the clouds and not too sheltering True joy, balance, love All you look for from above Let the rains come down I worried I would drown The taste of water, strange and sweet - Running down my tongue and cheeks - That works. It's good. He's not for us! He will never be for us! The cowboy sittin' in the office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., is not my president, he is not your president. He is not the candidate that was voted for by the majority of U.S. citizens. Do you think that we should stay here? They are saying very bad things about the president. No, it's freedom of speech. But it's now time for us to push him out! He must go! - He is a fraud! - He must go! He must go! He must go! He must go! Now I can say I am New Yorker? Not so fast. I haven't even shown you Battery Park yet. Battery? Yeah. It's my neighborhood. Um... give me a call... if you want another tour. Your number? Yeah. They fly through Canada, the United States and Mexico, across Central America... Uh, Laura, what can you tell us about what you saw? I got up to my window. I live in Battery Park City, right next to the Twin Towers, and I looked up and the side of the north building of the World Trade Center exploded... right when I looked up, and, uh, at that point... Hello? This is Ibrahim from yesterday. Yes. What's going on there? Are you okay? Yeah. Uh... Oh, my God... Diane? Diane? ...top part. People are running up... Um, we are getting word that perhaps a second plane... Good Lord. I don't know if you... you can see the plane, if that too was a passenger plane or... Perhaps some type of navigating system or some type of, uh... uh... electronics, would it put two planes into the World Trade Center within... it looks like about 18 minutes of each other? ...word now that President Bush is going to be coming on... and is going to have comments, uh, momentarily. - We understand... - My brother is down there. He owns a kiosk at the bottom of the tower. What the hell am I supposed to do? ...we understand. Again, it is too early to know who bears responsibility for these acts. He'll never make it out of there. But Islamic fundamentalist Osama bin Laden... has been mentioned as someone who is determined... I'm sorry. I-I have to close. You said he's at the bottom of the tower. I'm sure he escaped already. He will return safe. What the hell do you know? What if those assholes strike again? - What if he's injured? - If he's hurt, someone will help. You have to wake up, buddy. The people flying those planes, they look like us. No one's going to help my brother. No, I'm sure he will return. You'll see. - - Terrorist sand niggers! Go back to your own country! What the hell? What did I tell you? This is just the beginning. Get in. I know that you're scared, and this is normal. But nothing will happen. This is America. How long have you been in this country? One day. One day? Yeah... World Trade Center in New York appears... - What makes you an expert on how this country works? - I never said I'm an expert. And not a single day has passed that someone hasn't given me a dirty look... because of the way that I look. What happened today is just going to make things worse. If I were you, I'd keep a low profile. I'm so sad for what they have done. But I'm not going to hide because I-I haven't done anything wrong. Do you even realize what happened today? Do you have any idea how huge this is? You're living in a fantasy world if you feel you won't be affected by this. I can't believe what you're saying. You're an American, but you don't act like a real citizen. - And how does a real citizen act? - I don't know, it's just... You're a part of this country. You should help, not hide. ...Vice President Cheney has entered an underground bunker. I'm not the only one hiding. The New York City Port Authority orders all bridges and tunnels in New York City closed. What if he doesn't come back? I'm... I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. You know what? You should come with me. No. I've got to stay. Ibrahim. Watch your back. People are crazy out there. America God shed His grace on thee Diane. Time for blood drive. Are you coming with me? Yeah. I'm just gonna go downstairs and have a smoke first. I'll wait for you here. Okay. Federal agents! Get down! Get down! Police! Federal agents! Get down! Stay down! Guys, I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. Shut up! - Who are you? - Come on! I hear you have a bit of a sweet tooth. Oh, yeah. The handcuffs. I can make those go away. All you have to do is change your mind. About what? He's your first cousin. Your only relative in the U.S., and you have no idea where he is? He... He was supposed to pick me up. I'm not asking you where he's supposed to be. I'm asking you where he is now. I don't know. You don't know. That's too bad. We'll give you a little time to think it over. Please, sir. I need to know what's going on. Please, I didn't do it. Please. I-I'm sorry. What was his name again? How many times do I have to tell you? It's Ibrahim Jarrah. Please write it down. I'm sorry, ma'am. I don't have any arrest records for him. All I know is that a bunch of guys in official uniforms, they threw him in a van. It's the last time I saw him. Look, I'm sorry. Americans are asking, "Why do they hate us?" They hate our freedoms... our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. So you show up at JFK one day before 9/11. You've got the same last name as one of the hijackers, who's actually from the same country as you. You lie about some cousin who's supposed to pick you up. You want me to see this as all... one big, fat coincidence? I don't know. - Who trained you? - Trained me for what? How long have you been planning this with Ziad before you showed up? I know nothing. Then why did you make up some bullshit lie about your cousin? May I speak to a lawyer, please? Terrorists don't get lawyers. I was just wondering if there was an update on Ibrahim Jarrah's status. Still no record? Okay. Okay, thank you, Officer. When was the last time you spoke to Ziad Jarrah? I swear I don't know. I've never heard of someone named... The same country that's smaller than Connecticut, but you've never heard of him? - Son of a bitch. - He's not family. I know nothing about him. You're free to go. You'll be escorted out in the morning. Hello? Hello. Diane. Who is this? This is Ibrahim. Oh, my God, Ibrahim. Where... Where are you? Are you okay? Come on in. Um, sorry it's a mess. I wasn't expecting company. Um, just sit anywhere. Uh... Uh, so they held you in a prison for six months, questioning you... and didn't even tell you why? Yeah. So why did they let you go? Couldn't find anything against me. That's horrible. I'm sorry. Um, I kept your things... your luggage and stuff. Oh, thank you. Yeah. I ate all your, um... your candies, those... Yeah. They, uh... They helped me quit smoking, so thank you. I'm happy to hear that. Really happy. Yeah, I had to move away from Battery Park. It was... The air was terrible, and it was too close to Ground Zero, and I just... I'm sorry. I'm rambling. No, no, no. I'm gonna get you a pillow. You know, I tried to call the police a few times to try to find you, but they kept telling me that they didn't know anything, and... I don't understand how they could... Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. Either you are with us... or you are with the terrorists. Did he ask for your number? Oh, you gotta go out with him. Yeah, it'll be great. No, wear the brown ones. I'll give you an emergency call 20 minutes in. No biggie. Hang on. Excuse me, I'm looking for a job. Yeah, just file your application over at the computer station. Yeah, I'm back. No, it'll be great! Yeah, hold on. If you can just please help me... Look, the application is designed to filter out those who are ineligible. So if you can't figure that out on your own, you're not qualified to work for a temp agency. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Yeah, I'm back. Some guy lookin' for a job. There's always tomorrow. I've been fixing cars since I was a kid. I was fixing my uncle's car, and when I moved to Kuwait, I did the same. And this is what I know, and this is what I want to do. This is my whole life. Look, habibi, I'd love if I could help a fellow Lebanese, but in this economy, you think I can hire somebody else? I can't. Economy. Thank you. So what'd they say? You know what? It's their loss. I thought the economy was bad in the Middle East. Come on. You know what? You've been doing everything you can. Hey, you know what? I'm gonna stop and grab a drink. Can you chill for a sec? Chill? Um... relax. Okay. Okay. That'll be 2.50, please. Hey, don't I know you? I don't think so. No, we... I got it. We... met on that horrible day. Um... Oh, yeah, I-I think I remember you now. How is your friend, uh, Ibrahim? It's funny you should ask. Hey, you're never gonna believe it. I got you a job. What? Hey, Ibrahim. Mo. I thought you owned the mini-mart? That's my brother's mini-mart. I cover for him sometimes. This is my business. I own this place. You start tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. Don't be late. No way. Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you. Morning. 8:00 a.m. You should be here behind the counter, not at the door. I'm sorry. Okay. Listen to me. Please, be very careful. Put the bottles in gently, one at a time. But, uh, make sure not to push too hard because they will break. Okay, got it. Ooh! Wow, wow, wow! Shit! I should be able to contact you at all times to make sure the shifts are covered. You will pick up all the little things with experience, but you should remember... Just this one? The most important rule of all... He did not pay! Under no circumstances should you ever leave the store unsupervised. See, I need to catch the bus, and my wallet... my wallet is... You're not gonna take my money, are you? What? You just seen too many movies if you think every black man you see is gonna rob you. Hey! What'd I tell you about disturbing my customers? He work here! He ain't no customer! Neither are you. Now, get lost. By the way, you're late. Why? You said 8:00. It's 7:45. Well, I meant 7:00. Now hurry up. The land of... the free... and... the home... of the brave. So what does that mean to you guys? 9.25, sir. Have a good day. Hey, Ibrahim, don't leave the money on the counter. Listen, you can't let these guys bother you, otherwise you won't get through the day. It's just part of the job. Now, uh, go have lunch. Okay. Ibrahim. Mmm. Oh, man. You really hooked me up. I was starting to feel light-headed there for a minute. No problem. You know what? During the Gulf War, I was in Kuwait. And to escape the violence, I had to drive to the edge of the country. I lived out of my car. No food. No drink. For a while, man. What is this, some kind of lame-ass hunger contest? I get it, man. You've been hungry before too. Least you up outta that now. Least you ain't gotta sleep out here on these streets. I don't care what country you from. These streets, they'll tear you apart. What I'm trying to say is, it's possible to change your life. You can succeed anywhere, man. Just... You have to decide. Yeah? Well, that's great advice coming from a guy who works at a gas station. I didn't mean that, man. I'm sorry. No problem. That's just my pride talking. I used to have a career. Keeping books. Yeah? And what happened? You know. Little bit of gambling, little bit of drinking... and a whole lot of bad luck. Pretty much downhill after that. I ain't had a place to stay in years. Hello. Ibrahim. - All right, I'm gettin' up. - Whoa! - Who the hell are you? - Diane, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. This is Mickey, my friend. He just needs a place to stay while he's looking for a job. I'll be responsible. I'll be for him to stay here, okay? Does this look like a halfway house to you? I can't have some bum off the street on my couch. I'm not a bum. I've got a name. It's Mickey. Nice to meet you. He's going to find a job. I will help him. Please. Please. She's feisty. I like that. Shh. Ibrahim. Hey, kids. Oh, how are you? How are you, Rajiv? Good. How are you doing? Fine. Good, good. Is my brother ready? I'll check for you. Okay. Tip-off's in 15 minutes. And I can't watch the Knicks lose without him, okay? Okay. Okay. Boys, you want some candy? Yeah. Okay, come on, let's get some. Kids, brother are waiting. What? The game is about to start. No, no. Too much work. Tell Rajiv to take them without me. Hey, man, you're working very hard. Take a day off. I can't, okay? If I don't get these logs filled or pay the bills, you and I both will be out of a job. What's wrong with you? This is the same brother you almost lost back in September. You cried and said, "I couldn't live without him." And now you don't have time for him? Don't you dare talk to me about my family. And you'd better keep your mouth shut if you want to keep working here. Do you understand? I just... wanted you to be happy. Then leave me alone so I can finish my work. Legal. Legality. Equal. Equality. Civil. Civility. Final. Finality. I think that's it for tonight. Please drop off your papers before you leave. Excuse me. Do I look like the teacher of the course? Then why are you staring at me the entire class? Hmm. I stop looking at you if it's uncomfortable. Well, I haven't decided yet. - It's Baha. - Ibrahim. I just started the classes for my degree, so I've been so busy. Plus, I miss home. It's hard being away from my family, especially when my mother was so sick. But... she's in remission now. I understand. Surely after my first semester I can visit her again. Tell me about your parents. My parents? Um... Yes. They must miss you so much. They died in the civil war. I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. This is why it's so important for me to make a new family. You know what I mean? Oh. Look what time it is. I should be going. It was nice talking to you. See you next week. Bye. Baha. Hmm? If you let me take you to a dinner, I'll stop looking at you in the class. Okay. Pick me up tomorrow at 5:30. Your number? Yes. Okay. Damn, man! How much of that stuff you gonna put on? You got it smellin' like the lobby of a department store up in here. Too much, huh? It's cool. I mean, hey, whatever works for you. We all gotta get our mac on. "Mac on"? What does it mean, "mac on"? Never mind, dawg. You're good. Okay. Ibrahim. Yeah. I want to thank you, man. Thank you for everything you've done for me. No, don't thank me. Just help a little. You have to help yourself. And remember: Tomorrow morning, we're going to find a job for you. Tomorrow morning. All right, I'll be ready. I'll be ready. Have fun. What's up? This some damn good cereal you got here. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. What'd I do? Easy, man, easy. Chill. Chill? All right. What do you want? I'm sorry. Our business here. And here is money for him to stay. I want him gone. One more day. Just one day. I will talk to Mo for him to work in the gas station, sleep in the basement. Okay? Remember? Plant your good deeds. - Fine. One more day. - Thank you. Not an hour more, or I'm kicking both your asses out. Do you understand? Thank you. Thank you very much. Where are you going after work? Thank you, ma'am. Have a good day. Hey, Mo, I've got to change. See you tomorrow. Indian food in America with a beautiful Lebanese girl. It's nice. I love tandoori. Where did you find this place? I didn't find it actually. It was recommended by my boss. I wanted to take you to a Lebanese restaurant, but I couldn't find a good one yet. It's okay. It would just make us miss home. Home? What does it mean? This is home now. Maybe for you. Mm-hmm. How do you like your job at the gas station? I appreciate my work a lot. I imagine myself without it, it's... How good I have it. Of course, this is not what I came for here in America. I have bigger plans. I want to have my own business. I know everything about cars. I just need to know how business works in this country, and then I will open my own shop. Open your own business? Mm-hmm. You're so Lebanese. Why not? Have you ever thought about getting married? You don't waste time, do you? At all. Oh. I have to make a phone call. And you think about my question while I'm gone. Okay? He's doing okay. But he wanted me to let you know what was going on. I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, Baha. I have to leave. What's wrong? Emergency at work. I will get you a taxi. Check, please. Oh, my God. It's my fault. I... I should have watched them more carefully. Doctor says that you're lucky they did not shoot. Lucky. Yeah, you're right. Actually, I don't believe in luck, you know this. I will not let something like this happen again. I promise you. That is impossible. You will not be coming back. What do you mean? - I am selling the gas station. - No. Please, my friend, I mean, uh, think about it later... Don't think about it now. I have thought about it. It's all I ever think about. You were right. I need to spend more time with my kids. I need to see more of my brother. I've spent too many years hiding from my life at that damn place. My family deserves better from me. Good for you. Good for you, my friend. Sometimes you have to know when to quit. Yeah. What happened here? Where did all of the stuff go? Why don't you ask your friend Mickey? Mickey? Mickey. Diane... I don't wanna hear it. I know it's bad. I... I will help you replace everything. You've been so helpful so far. Just give me the chance to fix it. You know what would fix this, is if you left. I can't do this anymore. Just grab the rest of your shit and go. Give me my keys. Diane, you don't know what happened last night. Do you think I care what happened on your date last night? Date? What are you talk... Are you talking about Baha? You know what? Just shut up. I can't do this anymore. All this crap about planting your good deeds is over. If you don't leave in 15 minutes, I'm calling the cops. Give me the keys. Good-bye, Diane. I'm sorry for everything. All is calm All is bright Round yon virgin Mother and child Hi, Diane. I-I'm sorry to bother you. Can I speak to Ibrahim? He's not here. What happened to you? Are you okay? What's going on? He didn't tell you? Where is he? He's gone. I mean, he's not gone, gone. He's around, but... Won't you see him at the gas station? Actually I-I'm going out of town for a while. Oh. Well, what's gonna happen with the gas station? I... I decided to sell it. Um, there was an incident. I'm sure he'll explain it to you. Can you make sure to give this to him? I should've given it to him earlier. I just, um... I just didn't. Better late than never. - I'll make sure he gets it. - Thank you. Merry Christmas, everybody. God bless. Happy Hanukkah, man. - Let's go. - Hey! Maybe you didn't hear. He said "Christmas," dipshit. Yeah, I heard what he said. Are you trying to make some kind of statement? Settle down, bro. - I got no beef with Christmas. - Just let it go, Josh. I don't want any trouble. Okay, guys? Let's just forget the whole thing. It's a little too late for that, you dirty kike! Oh, my God! Please, somebody, help! - Please! - Cops! Cops! Somebody, help, please! Somebody, please! Hey, you're awake. Look, I know you're all jacked up on pain meds, but, uh, I gotta thank you. I owe you my life. Did they call Diane? Who? Diane. Excuse me. Hi. I'm looking for Ibrahim Jarrah. And get plenty of rest, okay? Thank you, Doc. All right. Hi. I'll check back on you later on. What did you do this time? He saved my ass is what he did. Still not sure why. So, how's the baba ghanoush? Ghanoush is great, for the first time. And last time. I want to show you something. Um, watch this. Everyone else on the street looked the other way. Ibrahim was the only person who had the courage to step in. And... if he hadn't been there, then... who knows what would have happened to me? Congratulations. You're a hero. - Mm-hmm. - You're also an idiot. Of course. I'm sorry for what happened. Especially about Mickey. Mickey was my fault too. I shouldn't have let you talk me into it. - I'm sorry I kicked you out. - I deserved it. No. You didn't deserve it. I mean, no one deserves what happened to you. I'm sorry. Um, I almost forgot. This is... is for you. From your old boss. Mo? Mm-hmm. That's a lot. I need it. Don't spend it all in one place. That's really nice. Just come here. Here's something beautiful. Oh, wow. This is great. It looks even better than before Mickey. Happy to hear that. See? I have little money, but I have taste. Thank you. And you get extra points for the flowers and the card. You don't thank me. Once I find a job, you will help me to create my apartment. Have you worked in the automotive field in the past, or have you ever sold anything in the United States? Yes. When I was in Kuwait, I worked as an auto mechanic. And I worked in petroleum and merchandise sales here in New York. You know, we'll call you if anything comes up. Thank you. On top of that, I have years of experience in sales. Mr. Ray, I promise I will do my best. - I'm sure you will. Very impressive credentials. - Thank you. - I just need to be honest with you about something. - Please. If you're serious about being hired, you're gonna have to change your name. - What? - Take it from me. Oh. Thank you, Mr. Raheem. Appreciated. - So your boss was almost killed. - Mm-hmm. You lost your job. And then you were beat up by a bunch of racists? Yes. It's not funny. You need to be more careful. Baha, I've seen worse than this. And everything happens for a reason. Just... I don't know the reason yet. I'm glad you're okay. Are you okay? What's wrong? I spoke to my mother last night. Her cancer came back, much worse than before. I'm so sorry to hear this. I fly to Beirut on Friday to be with her. Of course. When are you coming back? I can't come back, Brahim. I have to stay there with her. What do you mean? Just thinking that... you and I could... Maybe we could have something. But not here. Why would you want to stay here anyways? Look how they treat you. Are you asking me to come with you? I'm just asking you to think about what you're giving up to be here. - Is it really worth it? - Yes. To me, it's worth it. And you know this. You're such a dreamer. I'm not a quitter. Well, I hope you find what you're looking for here. I'll pray for your mother. Good-bye, Ibrahim. - Josh! - Ibrahim, it's good to see you again. - What are you doing here? - See you're still in one piece, huh? Looking good, man. Please, uh, meet my pops. - David. - Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm sorry I never got the chance to thank you personally, so, uh, thank you. Diane tells me you have a business degree. You used to sell cars. Mark. Terry. Want you to meet somebody. Oh, Mark, Ibrahim. Ibrahim, Mark. Nice to meet you. Call me anytime. Made for you, man. Very suitable. Drive safe. Okay, you only named 10 of the original colonies. I need three more. Okay. Pennsylvania, Rhode Island... and, um, New York. Yes. New York! Okay, for the final question of the citizenship exam for Mr. Ibrahim Jarrah, why did the Pilgrims come to America? You've been in the country the required amount of time. We have your N-400 form, your filing fee, If you pass the background check, we will provide you the date and time for your citizenship test. Thank you. Diane. Hey. So, guess what I have for you. What? No way. Yes way. Notice to appear. "Mr. Jarrah, based on evidence gathered by the Department of Homeland Security, you are being recommended for deportation to your country of origin. You are hereby summoned to appear in court... to respond to the charge filed against you, and either accept... or contest your deportation." This cannot be happening. Nothing's happening yet. It's just a letter telling you that you have to go to court. - So? - So you go, you show up and you defend yourself. You can beat this. You just have to decide. Remember? Those are your words. Has been already decided. It's obvious that you people don't want me here. What is that supposed to mean, "you people"? I need to be alone. Please. You mean people like me, who let you live on my couch when you were broke? And people like Mo and Josh's father, who gave you a job? Yeah, we're all busting our asses to help you, but secretly, we want you to fail. You have no idea what it's like to struggle your whole life and have nothing to show for it. What did you expect? You were gonna come to New York, and magically all your problems are gone? I thought I could find a new home, a place who will judge me by my action, not by my skin color. Don't give me that "skin color" crap. Save that for the judge. You know what? I don't care anymore. They can send me wherever they want. Okay? I'm tired of fighting. They can... I don't want it. Fine. Hello. Hi, Ibrahim. This is Diane. Yes. We need you here. Hi. Hi. - Good to see you, my friend. - Good to see you, brother. Want you to meet someone... highly recommended immigration attorney. Earl Miller. You ready for the fight of your life? Why don't you stop by my office sometime? We can have a little chat. Ah, Mr. "Jarruh," thank you for coming. - Thank you. Jarrah. - Oh, Jarrah. Beg your pardon. Please, have a seat. Thank you. Would you like a cup of coffee? I just brewed some. It's a hazelnut blend from Sumatra or something. It's actually quite tasty. - I'm good, thank you. - No? Did you get a chance to review and sign that document... I sent over to your apartment? Yes. I'm not sure that I fully understand it. Don't worry. It's mostly legal mumbo jumbo anyway. Essentially it says that, uh, we have 90 days to file a motion on your behalf... and that you're retaining my services. I think there must be a mistake in it. It doesn't say anything about the payment. - That won't be necessary. - No, no, Mr. Miller. - You don't have to do that. - Ibrahim, please. These kinds of cases can usually be very expensive. And it's ones like yours that remind me why the hell I even do this work. Appreciated. Don't know how to thank you. Thank me when the trial is over. Do you really think that we have a chance? Well, probably won't be a home run. The odds are a hundred-to-one against us, but we'll certainly give it our best shot. You do have something in your favor... Even as a resident alien, you have certain rights, and we're gonna get the government to clarify precisely what those are. But I won't lie to you. We have a lot of work to do. We need a public trial. If it's private, it's over. And the only way it'll go public is if we can get some buzz. You understand? Yes, understand. Hmm. First of all, I need you to tell me everything about you. - Of course. - Everything. Yeah. Hey, Jennifer, do me a favor. Get me Mike at Channel 10. I'm calling with some breaking developments on the Ibrahim Jarrah story. No, this is not just another deportation case. We're talking about a guy who saved American lives. You said you could get me 50 people for the courthouse steps. Can we make it a hundred? What is your goal here with this protest? We want to make sure that justice is served... and that Ibrahim Jarrah becomes a citizen of the United States. We want him to know that there are people who care about him... Yeah. And who know the truth. And we're here for him, and we want him here. Ibrahim Jarrah plans to contest what his lawyers call... an unjust and un-American... violation of his civil rights. Officials are seeking to deport Jarrah to Lebanon, his country of origin. Good afternoon. I'm here outside the immigration courthouse... with some supporters of Ibrahim Jarrah, who are very vocal, to say the least. Here I have in the crowd, uh, Mickey Johnston, a formerly homeless bookkeeper who Ibrahim befriended... and supported financially back in 2002. Mr. Johnston, what do you have to say about Mr. Jarrah? I owe him my life. I took advantage of his friendship. And I want to apologize for it. - Here. - Yeah. In front of everybody. Ibrahim, if you're out there listenin', I'm sorry, man. I don't understand why people want to hate on you so tough... after all you did just to get into this country. And I'll tell you, they ain't gonna shut up about you... until you become... an American citizen. And that's the story from the immigration courthouse. Back to you in the studio. I'll talk to Ron at his radio station. It's not like we're asking him to write the story, just send us a reporter. That way you can tell him in your own words. Hi. Let me call you back. Guys, just came from the courthouse. We have a public hearing. Yes. As you can see behind me, it's not quiet out here though. A crowd has started to gather. There are supporters of Jarrah here on one side. There are also people holding signs that say... All rise. Please be seated. In the matter of Ibrahim Jarrah's removal proceeding, we will begin with the government's presentation. Thank you, Your Honor. I am here today because I care deeply about this country, its citizens and its safety. I intend to demonstrate to you... that Ibrahim Jarrah, who ironically has become an icon... for many unknowing civil libertarians, poses a threat to our national security... and should therefore be deported. He has lied about his reasons for being here, from the very moment he arrived. On September 10, 2001, a concerned immigration agent at JFK phoned the U.S. Department of State. He believed that Ibrahim's uniquely fragmented background... and contradictory answers to routine questions raised a red flag. The U.S. acted decisively upon that suspicion, and Ibrahim was detained immediately after the September 11 attacks. Today, Mr. Miller will cite unfounded anecdotes... to make you believe that Ibrahim is a misunderstood hero. Each moving story that you'll hear about Ibrahim... is a fabrication, designed to mask the true Ibrahim Jarrah, a man who has known connections to the people... who helped plan and execute the 9/11 attacks, a man who actually filmed himself... attending a hateful anti-American rally... within 24 hours of his arriving in New York City, a man who for six months evaded questions... about his connection to enemy combatants when detained in Brooklyn, a man who still has the audacity to deny his connection... to a 9/11 hijacker with the same last name, from the same country, who arrived in this country at almost the same time. As if this were not enough, the government has gained secret evidence... that links Ibrahim's cousin Rashad to the 9/11 attacks. While I'm not at liberty to disclose the nature of this evidence, there is more than enough supporting evidence to justify Ibrahim's deportation. He must be sent back to his country of origin... without delay. Thank you. Your Honor, I think the counsel for the government's impassioned statement... that he cares so deeply about this country, while commendable, is hardly mutually exclusive. In fact, I think it's fair to say that all of us here care deeply about this country, including my client, which is why he's here today. Now, as for the charges against him, I wish to state for the record... that Mr. Ibrahim Jarrah is not, was not, and will never be... a threat to the security of this country. Indeed, Mr. Jarrah is a man who came here... in search of the American dream. But instead, he has been trapped... in an unconstitutional nightmare. This man was detained for six months... six months, Your Honor... without cause, without the right to an attorney, without even being explicitly told why he was being detained. And after six months of being held against his will without explanation, he was suddenly released. And why? I'll tell you why. Because the U.S. government admitted... and I'm quoting here... "There is no credible evidence... that Mr. Jarrah played a role in the 9/11 attacks." Now, all of a sudden the government is changing its tune, saying he shoul be deported. And why is that? Is it because of some new damning discovery, or because he... he... he violated some law? Absolutely not. No. The government wants him deported... because of some allegations against his cousin, - supported by... by... by some... - "secret evidence." Now, leaving aside the fact that his cousin is not on trial here today, let us examine that phrase "secret evidence," shall we? A secret is something that is hidden from view. Now evidence, on the other hand, is something that is, by definition, visible. So how can something that is a secret also be evident? Well, the simple fact is, it cannot, Your Honor. It defies all legal logic. Your Honor, the phrase "secret evidence" is an oxymoron. It is a false construct that provides a platform for xenophobia, the same xenophobia that corrupted our country... when Japanese-Americans were... were unfairly detained during World War II. By seeking to deport Mr. Jarrah, we are saying to him, and legal aliens like him, "You are not welcome here." Your Honor, if this man is deported, it will quite simply be a violation of his human rights. It will also be inconsistent with our values... of fairness, equality and justice. The great thing about America... is we have a rich history... of reversing mistakes, If you dismiss the fearmongering endorsed by the prosecution today, you can rest assured that you also... will be on the right side of history. Thank you. Thank you, both, for your statements. Mr. Winston, this court cannot draw any real conclusions... based on evidence that cannot be made known, even if it does pertain to a relative of Mr. Jarrah's. Your Honor, the very nature of secret evidence prohibits its public release, so as not to pose a threat to national security. If you would like to know the specific nature of the evidence against Rashad, federal law stipulates that you must request a special clearance. Once you're granted that special clearance, I can freely share the evidence with you in a private session. In that case, this court will reconvene... once I've been given special clearance... and had an opportunity to review the secret evidence... against Rashad, and, by proxy, Mr. Jarrah. Court is adjourned. - Thank you, Your Honor. - All rise. What is this secret evidence? How are we supposed to fight that? We can't get ahold of Rashad. What could he have done? I doubt very much whether Winston even knows. He's just... He's just going for guilt by association. Good night, Earl. Good night, Joe. You know what? I have to defend myself, Earl. You have to let me speak. I've already told you that would backfire. Putting you on the stand will just play right into Winston's hands. H-He... He'll just eat you alive. It's my life he's trying to destroy here. If the judge doesn't hear my voice, he will believe all of his lies. But... I don't think you fully appreciate the risk... Risk? You think I don't understand risk? Don't you think that I took the huge risk already... to be here in this country? I know exactly what it is. Come on. This is not the time to be safe. Come on. If I lose without having the chance to speak, I will not be able to live with myself. Earl Miller. Is this the attorney representing Ibrahim Jarrah? Yes. Who is this? This is Ibrahim's cousin, Rashad. Rashad. The story is all over the news, and I don't know how to get ahold of Ibrahim. Please. You have to hear me out. Yes, please go ahead. A judge will soon decide the fate of Mr. Jarrah. We cannot have cameras inside the courtroom, so we're not sure exactly what's going on. But I can tell you, things are certainly starting to get ugly. Ibrahim Jarrah has been in the country for quite some time... as a student and as a worker. He won the... Ibrahim, I want to talk to you about something, and I want you to be totally honest with me, okay? Is there anything else about this case that's pertinent that I should be aware of? Of course not. I told you everything. Why? Well, this case is already getting very complicated, and I don't want any more surprises. So if there's something you want to tell me, just... What are you talking about? I got a call from your cousin this morning. - Rashad? - Mm-hmm. What did he say? Well, it's not good. Rashad let someone stay in his apartment a few days before... a few days before 9/11. A friend of a friend apparently. Rashad said he didn't know it at the time, but... turns out this guy helped plan the attacks. Why didn't he call me? I asked him the same thing. He says as soon as he found out, But he never mentioned anything to you about this guy, nothing at all? Mention what? He did not even bother to pick me up from the airport. Well, he said he did, but he went to the wrong one. What kind of excuse? He should have called me. I told him where I was staying. He did. But that's not important now. What's important is that... we discuss this before I put you on the stand. You will? Yeah. I thought about what you said, and... I realized it was inevitable. So, look, I want you to defend yourself. Don't try to play the hero. Just keep your answers simple and to the point, because I don't want that little weasel in there twisting your words around, okay? Just follow my lead. All right, come on. Mr. Jarrah, kindly tell the court, in your own words, how long have you dreamt of being an American citizen? Since I was 12 years old. And what happened to you when you were 12? At that time Lebanese civil war was so bad... we had to live in a shelter. So many bombs. Too much shooting. My father made sure that we sleep on the kitchen floor, away from the windows, so the missiles could not hit us at night. Although I managed to stay safe, one morning our house was bombed, and both my parents were killed. I knew this was no way to live, so I began to study a lot at school... so I could move away. I see. And how did you feel... when you learned that the country that you fought so hard to become a citizen of... sought to deport you? I was devastated, and confused. Can you elaborate, please? Even after being detained for a crime that I did not commit, I still wanted to stay here and become a citizen. I thought to myself, "This country's just going through a crisis, and one day I will have my freedoms like everyone else." And now they say, "You hate all freedoms." Why would I spend my whole life dreaming about freedoms that I hate? And what would you say to those Americans... who think that you should be sent back to Lebanon immediately? I would just ask them to remember... what they had to go through to become an American citizen. What I want to say... I respect the laws of this country in a way that only an immigrant can. Good. Thank you, Mr. Jarrah. No further questions, Your Honor. Mr. Winston, you may cross-examine the witness. Good morning. Prior to your arrival in 2001, had you made any other visits to this country? No. Did your duties as an auto mechanic in any way necessitate... a relocation to the United States? Would you please repeat the question? What brought you to this country? Mr. Jarrah, why are you here? I wanted to become an American. I see. So you thought you could reverse a lifetime... of personal failures by starting over in America. Failures? Well, isn't it true... that you were unable to earn a decent wage... in Lebanon, Syria or Kuwait... despite having earned a business degree? What made you think you would be guaranteed a better life in America? What made the Pilgrims think they would have a better life... when they came here in 1621? What made the immigrants from nearly every country in Europe and Asia... come here to Ellis Island? They knew there were no guarantees. They came anyway. And now 40% of the United States population... can be traced back to these immigrants. Thank you for that fascinating history lesson, Mr. Jarrah. But let's return to the 21st century for a moment. On the morning you arrived, did you not attend an antigovernment rally? Yes, I did. Considering your nationality, and the fact that you were shouting anti-American rhetoric... on the streets of New York the day before September 11, why should God-fearing Americans believe... that someone like you wishes no harm to their country? Would you please clarify? When you say "anti-American," do you mean that criticizing the president means that someone doesn't care about this country? No! What I mean... And when you say someone like me, do you mean someone from a part of the world that you fear... because simply you do not wish to understand? What I mean is... And when you say "God-fearing Americans," do you mean that I worship an inferior god to yours? I never said that. And when you say "the day before 9/11," do you mean that I'm somehow connected to this event? Mr. Jarrah, there are lingering questions about you. Based on your question, you have gone against freedom of speech, freedom of religion... and the process of law at the same time. I cannot answer such an un-American question... because I am here in the United States of America, where the Bill of Rights must be respected, where anyone can be president, regardless of his color. Perhaps you should read up on the Constitution... before you come up with your next question. - Your Honor. - Mr. Jarrah, just answer the questions as they are asked. Yes, Your Honor. Upon arrival in New York, were you not planning to stay with your cousin Rashad? Yes, his family. But when I got to America, he was not there. He went to another airport. Well, that's interesting. Isn't it bizarre... that a close relative would make such a dumb mistake? Yes, but this is what happened... Mr. Jarrah, isn't it true that you lied... to a federal agent about where you were planning to stay... on the night you arrived in this country? No. Well, you said your cousin had arranged a hotel for you. But these records indicate... that Rashad never even called the Brooklyn Express Motel... before September 10, 2001. Objection, Your Honor. How is this relevant? - Overruled. - And isn't it true... you have a family member, Ziad Jarrah, who actually hijacked United Flight 93 on September 11? Objection! Speculation. Overruled. He's not family. He's not family, and I know nothing about him. No further questions, Your Honor. Mr. Jarrah, thank you. You may step down. Thank you. Mr. Jarrah, will you please rise? This court finds that Ibrahim Jarrah... is no a security threat... to the United States of America. In addition, this court is recommending... that Mr. Jarrah's application for citizenship be expedited... so that no other impediments... bar him from completing the requirements... necessary to become a United States citizen. Congratulations. The sun returns the heat Burns the soles of my feet I wasn't trying to escape the sun All I knew was I had to run And so to find some shade Hey, boss. Lovely choice. The wind was blowing towards the west My heart was beating through my chest Searching for a sky Not too wet, not too dry Wide and open, spacious Free of the clouds and not too sheltering True joy, balance, love All you look for from above There's no room to hide Well, don't just do, decide When the dark clouds clear Blue skies free me from my fears So, go, there's much to choose To gain and still to lose I'm here Just want the clear and loud Of standing on a cloud
