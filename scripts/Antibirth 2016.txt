It's beast food. It's true, Lou. - When was the time of your last period? - Uh...Recent enough? - Do you remember the last time you performed intercourse? - Uh, it was not much of a performance. - Better not have been Mickey. - You drink? - Yeah, yeah, obviously. - Everyday? - Anha, come on, yeah. - You gonna wanna see a doctor, Lou. - Come on, anha, i -- I can't afford that, okay? Anha, look, i -- I don't have insurance. I was just hoping you could, you know, really suss it out. - Lou, I work for a vet. I can't prescribe anything. - Look, I feel like shit, alright?

Man, thanks for nothing, anha. Fuck! - What do you wanna do now? - I don't know. Let's grab some booze or snacks. - That's what he said. - Yeah. - You didn't hear me? - I don't know. I don't listen. I haven't been laid in months, okay? I know that I been, uh, on a bender. But I think I'd remember if I had someone's cock in me. - Maybe you should sell yourself on TV. One of those phantom pregnancies? Those girls who go through it all and didn't even realize they were pregnant. You know, and then it falls out all preemie and they bury it in the closet before prom? - Fuckin' preemie, Sadie. - Well, born too soon. - Shit's fucked up. I don't know, fuck it, like what does anha know anyway, right? She's a vet. Shitty vet. - Well, you said it yourself, Lou, you've been on a bender. You just need to stop partying for a couple days. - I'm not a dog, you know. She doesn't even know anything about people. Mm, I heard a dog got addicted to heroin because of her. I got too high. I mean.. I just.. I really can't be pregnant, alright? It's not my style. - You can always get rid of it. - I'm not gonna pay some asshole to scramble my guts. - There's always someone who wants a baby. Just adopt it out. - You think I can find somebody to push me down a staircase or something? I can't believe I have to quit drinking, uh, no smoking. Who -- who needs that shit? Jeeze Louise, come on, Sadie. - Lou, you can handle it. I was pretty wasted when I was pregnant. - And what was that like? All that you know.. - It was so long ago, i don't remember. - Come here. Thank you. Why don't you go ahead and, uh, load up the cooler, baby? Trish? - Can I get you anything? - No, no, thanks. I'm good. - He'll take a beer. - You ever think it -- it's kinda funny that, uh they wouldn't need the clean piss if they weren't getting high. - I'm not responsible for their habits. If somebody's gonna make any money off it, it's gonna be me. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. - What am I gonna do, send her back to Russia? - Well, no, but, I mean you can't.. ...you can't just have these girls running around in the wild, you know? - Get off that.

Well, I think so. Jade's gonna chop it up, break it down, get it out there. - Right, right. Say...What do you want me to do with Lou? She's starting to get a bit paranoid, you know? - She's fucked up all the time. No one's gonna believe her. - Yeah. - Don't worry about it. - Cool, cool. So, what do you wanna do? - You're gonna go on the fuckin' run. - Alright. - Took you long enough. I didn't think, you were gonna show. - Where'd you get palace chicken? - I got lots. - I love that shit, give me a wing, man. - Fuck no. I have to go all the way to Liberty for this shit. Plus I got a meeting on my po tomorrow. - Just give me the fucking money. - You know they got a special kind of bleach in this shit? When they pound, crush down the bird. It gets rid of all the bones and beaks. - Yeah, right, asshole. Where'd you hear that? - Plus, if you eat enough of it at once, it'll pass any test. - So, what you gonna do, just eat yourself into a coma hope you don't piss your pants before you go in? - Tastes good. - Idiot. - Man, this place is a dump. I gotta clean up this shithole. - Oh, it's cold in here. You got any heat up in this bitch? - What am I, a rockefeller? Come on. Shit, man. You know, one second it's hot, then it's cold. But I mean, the cold, it's driving me loco. - You know, i just wanted to come up here and make sure everything was alright. You know? Ohh! - I love pissing. Hey, I'm hungry now. - Sweet. Lou, your dad was smokin' hot. - Uh, no shit, my dad was fucking hot. You know...Sadie.. ...sometimes being hot just ain't enough, man. You know, after Vietnam, he drove my mom crazy. - Well, it was pretty shitty. - No shit, man, no shit, Vietnam, you know. Shitty enough to get this sweet ass pad from uncle Sam. Right? - Did you do all these? - Huh? - Warren said he gave you a case last week. - Oh, fuck that, man. Man, my dad fought for the right to kill his brains. I'm just honoring his legacy. - I'm just saying if you're pregnant, you're gonna have to slow it down. - Alright, man. If I'm pregnant.. Like, maybe I can give this kid some superpowers, you know? Come on, he'll put it to good use. - Lou. - What? Let me ask you a question. Alright, Sadie, Sadie, this is important shit. Sadie, alright. If...You can have... Any superpowers.. I mean, anything... In the whole world, right? - Shit, I don't know, I mean.. I guess I'd wanna fly or teleport or whatever, you know? So, I could go wherever, whenever and get the hell outta here. - Yeah, man. That'd be cool. You know what I want? - Mm-hmm. - Do you know what I wanna do? I wanna be like that guy who had this, uh.. He was like that fuckin' guy who could turn into any animal he wanted, remember? Yeah, you had to have seen it, it was a show. Yeah, and so.. ...this fucking guy, he could be like a fucking turtle or a cheetah, you know? It was a show, right? But he had, you know.. ...just whenever you need it, man. - This was a show? - Oh, yeah. It was badass. - Well, when exactly do you need to turn into a turtle? And what kind of trouble are you in that you need to be a turtle. I can see you being a cheetah. - Hey, Sadie, what the fuck? What do you have against turtles, man? All kinds of fuckin' turtle trouble you put on your stealth situation.. Aah! - Oh! Oh, oh, shit. - Hey!

Get out of here. Get out of here. - You like playing with knives? Careful out there, lady. Don't get lost, okay? - I tell you, friends, if you've got to train for war, this is the place to do it. - Mm...Oh, Sadie, the last thing I remember mm...Is going off with Warren. And then it's just blank. You know, I got nothing. - We were partying all day. You were pretty lit by the time we got out there. - I remember coming back here with you, though, right? I mean... I remember coming back home. - Yeah, and you passed out. - Yeah, but I woke up here. - Looks like you got your appetite back. - Oh, yeah. You know, you go to these doctors.. ...and they don't give a shit, they don't care. You know, it's just in, out, give you some pills. Shit, man, I got pills. Mm, I gotta go into work, man, 'cause I am broke. - How long you been out? - Well.. Well...I had to go out all weekend. You know, i gotta pick up a shift 'cause after that, i got nothing. - Can't you just go down to Tonya's, work in her store? - No, man, fuck that. I mean.. ...it's basically impossible to get in there on time, you know? I mean, I kinda need to make my own hours. - It's gonna be alright, Lou. - So sick of this shit, man. I live in a goddamn dump, Sadie. I mean, I can barely even take care of myself let alone some weird immaculate conception shit. - Shit, look at that. Hey, come on, remember that place? That's the buck lanes. They turned it into a fuckin' funzone? - No, the parties are not gonna be the same around there, man. - For pizza and bowling lots and lots of crazy fun. - Go, Lou. - Come on! - Parking lot. - Good job, good job. - Oh! - It's the third time you sent her out tonight. - She's popular, what can I say? - Can I, can I get one of those baggies? - I'd be making a whole lot more money if it wasn't for you. - I need the stimulation. - Don't give me that shit. - Hello. - Hey, why don't you back off, weirdo. - Weirdo. - Yeah. You look weird. What, are you interested in cars? - I'm more interested in what's inside. - Oh? Well, it looks like she's almost done. But it's a little extra if you wanna watch. - Lou! Lou!

Thought I heard someone banging around outside. - Well, you should get that fixed. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - It's old, but it's free. - Hey, that's a nice ride, looks sweet. - Yeah, it was my dad's. He drove it out here once, he never used it again. - You sure are way the fuck out here. Let's get outta here, man. Let's go. Alrighty. - You got a haircut? - Don't mess my hair, man. - I'm not messing your hair up. I'm helping your hair. - It took me a while to fix it. - My problem was never your looks. It was always just your attitude. - What do you mean my attitude? What's wrong with my attitude? - Do I look really fuckin' bloated to you? Or is that my imagination? Let me tell you what I need. Candy.. - Uh-huh. - Money. - Uh-huh. - And whip-its. - Whip-its? - You put the little charger in the cracker, go.. - Got it. - And your mind goes.. Whomp, whomp, whomp.

What are you getting? - Luke, I need you to go in there and get me a pregnancy test. - What? No, man, no, no, get it yourself. - Man, I feel like shit. Look, if I go in there, everyone's just gonna think I'm pregnant. If you go in there, everyone's gonna think, you know, "look, he's getting laid.

Let's get outta here. - Thanks. - I don't know what Gabriel sells to those freaks but it turns them pretty quick. Now, he -- he's into some trucker speed he got into with the marines. - I'll tell you right now, okay? It's a bunch of garbage. He got kicked out for selling.. ...and he runs around bragging that it was some special ops bs, you know? - What? - He can't even get it up sometimes. 'Cause of all the tests they did on him. That's why he's such a maniac. - I don't mess around with that shit. You don't know what they put in that, you know, you get nonsense. - Man, I know where it goes. - Aw, man. - You know. - Yep. Oh, shit, hey, hey, Lou! Don't forget this. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Here you go, good luck. I hope you're not pregnant. - I hope you're not pregnant. - I hope you're not pregnant... Sexy. Lou, Lou, Lou. Mm, mm, mm. - Hey. - Yeah. - So there was a bachelor party in room 36. Whole bunch of guys and I put some rubber sheets in there for you. Said that they had a pretty good time. And I caught my girlfriend's kid watchin' me in the shower again. - Oh, yeah! - He's a total spaz, but, um this is supposed to mellow him out. - Yeah, great. - Uh...I feel like shit. Have you seen Warren lately? - No, I think he's working over at the funzone. Yeah, I saw him there when I went for my nephew's birthday party. Why, what do you want with that goon anyway? - Oh, mm.. Never mind. Let's bang out these rooms. - Jesus, your hair fuckin' gets everywhere. - Did you say my fuckin' hair gets everywhere? That shit gets fucking shaved raw. - Do guys actually like that? - I don't know what the fuck these guys want. That's why I have one side of my pussy really hairy the other side shaved bare. - That's disgusting. - I'll fucking show you disgusting. - Gimme my dollar. - What dollar? - Fuckin' dollar you just pocketed. - I don't have that dollar! - Fuck! - Is that creep still in 42? - Yeah, no one's seen him leave all week. - Man, I'm not cleaning up that shit when he gets outta there. I mean, who the hell knows what he's been doing in there. Are you still getting down with Jade? - No, he's bad news in a bad way. - Yeah, it took you a long time to figure that out. - Yeah, well, he was always a terrible kisser. He used to do this really fuckin' weird thing with his tongue. Hold on. - Oh, yeah, what'd he do? What, was it like this? Or sometimes he'd just jam it in there real quick and he's like.. - Oh, Jesus Christ! We just partied together. I don't know, i like getting fucked up but I don't need to make money off it. - Not me, I should get a goddamn sponsorship go corporate. - He thinks we're fuck buddies or something. I just wanna stay out of it. I don't, I don't care what he's up to. - Yeah, you know where he's been crashing? - No, nah, I don't know who he's mooching off of now. I'm gonna start in here, you wanna work your way down? - Yeah. - That's nast.. Oh, so nasty! You know that? - It's fuckin' good pizza. Fuckin' bought it, left it. Someone's gotta eat it. You wanna bite? - No! Fuck. Jesus. - Come on, man! Fuckin' someone's gotta eat it. Fuckin' wasting this pizza. Pigs. Fucking shit. Throw in trash, genius. Fucking hippies. Ow! Oh! - Hello? Hello, honey? Hello? I, uh, I left something in the bathroom and found you. I -- I'm lorna. - Alright, great. - Do you work here long? - Yeah. Man, easy money! - You must see, you must see a lot of people come and go. - This town definitely attracts some real weirdoes. - Well, some are. - Could be a good place to lay low but.. ...gets sticky. - Sticky? - You know, people pass through and they just never leave. - So you're a local? - Yeah, alright, so listen, lady uh, thanks a lot for helping me out in the can over there, but, man, uh you know, I'm just not feeling so hot. - Yeah. Yeah, right. - Yeah. - Of course. - Gotta get.. - I'm -- I'm sorry. - Gotta get back to work. So.. - Yeah, you take care, right? I hope you feel better. - Hey, Sadie. Yeah. Hey, can you pick me up? I don't know, in 10? Hold on, let me check. No, I'm out. Yeah. Yeah, get me some donuts. Alright, cool. Donuts, donuts for Lou, donuts. - Is that all you've eaten today? - No, I had some pizza like, you know, I got kinda fucked up. - You're relentless, aren't you? - Well.. Oh, come on! I already feel terrible and miserable. Tryin' to have a good time, right? - You're so positive. It's almost like, it's almost like you're glowing! Like you're -- - o -- okay, shut up, Sadie. Just fuckin' cut it out, alright? Man, I'm not pregnant. - You know they say your senses get all jacked when you're pregnant? Smells, taste, hearing. - You know what? Alright. Let's just wait, okay, 'cause I'm gonna.. ...see what these tests say. I'm gonna pee all over 'em. Man, I haven't been laid in months, okay? I mean, I'm not exactly cultivating a warm welcome nest down there, if you know what I mean. Look, it was six months ago, alright? I never told you about this 'cause I didn't think it mattered, but.. You remember that night at the auto bar? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, i been with Mickey but I knew he wasn't gonna do shit. That fuckin' prick. I just didn't wanna deal with it. I -- I just always thought i couldn't get pregnant. After that...I just figured i couldn't get pregnant. You know, I thought i fucked it all up. You know.. You know, all this shit just catches up with you. - He's crazy, Lou, I'm sorry. - Yeah. Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a mom. My -- my body literally rejected life. - This could happen to lots of ladies, Lou. - Yeah, those ladies are fucking, Sadie. Okay, they are fucking and sucking, right? And I'm, I haven't been laid since then. So how the hell could I be pregnant? - I don't know, Lou, are you sure you don't want some company? - I don't wanna make a big deal out of it just yet. - Are you gonna take the test? - Well, yeah, I think so. - Call me when you find out. - I'll call you. Yeah, I'm gonna have to drink a bunch to make all that piss so we'll see where the night takes me. - The couch. - Bingo! Drive safe, Sadie, it's snowing! - Jade. Jade. Oh, fuck. Oh! - ...you're correct for it won't take too long. - Fuck this shit. - ...the light of revelation. Embrace your future and master oblivion. A new world free of your body free of your mind free of every sensational toxic desire.. - Oh, no. - We dance while they eat our young. Do not dance. Let the infinity flow over you.. ...in waves of blissful.. ...new...Freedom. - She's getting comfortable. - What do you want me to do? She's loyal...The flow's heavy and it's clean. - It's gross. - Yeah, well, maybe if you could keep straight for a week, i could use your piss. - You're still peddling pee-pee to parolees, Gabriel. It's small time. - What's the rush, huh? - Yeah, I need the dough. Alright, I don't wanna lose touch again. - Still chasing that lawyer? - He's gonna help me out. - Someone's here. - So? - So, can you get the fucking door 'cause I wanna keep working out. - What? - Let me in, alright? I gotta talk to Gabriel. - What's up? What? - Jade is dead. - What do you mean, "Jade is dead?" - He's not just dead, man, his entire face is fuckin' rotted out. It's eaten off or some shit. I don't know, it's disgusting. - I saw him the other night, he's meant to be down cutting that stuff. - What stuff? - Stay out of this, Sadie. - I was there a couple of night ago. He said he had some ideas on how to split it up but he was having some trouble with -- - what kind of trouble? - I don't know, man. Sorry. I'm not a cook. He said he'd never seen anything like it, man. He said it, it was strong. - I told him not to fuck around with it. - How are you supposed to move the shit if you don't know how to break it up and get it out there? - Just shut up, Sadie. - He said it was a hard crash when he took it. Look, Gabe, this was more than a hard crash, man. He's fucking inside out or something. - Yeah, I told him I didn't know what it was gonna do. - That's your problem, Gabriel. You don't know what you're doing. - I keep a line between myself and these fucking people. Okay? He's trying to get people high I'm trying to make money. We don't know what happened to Jade. - Wait, he's dead. - Yeah, and it could've been a fucking fire or an accident. - Is this the shit you gave to Lou? - Yeah. - And now she's sick. - Fuck do you care, she's always sick. If she's not hung over, she's fucking wasted. - But her fucking face caving in and falling off might be a side effect she doesn't want. - He told me we had to test it before we could sell it. I don't use this shit and I told him not to fuck around with it! - Who told you? Hmm? Isaac? - Yeah, he told me what I needed to know. - Hey. What do you wanna do with it? - With what? - With the fucking body, man. He's still laying there, the place fucking reeks. - Get in your car go to the house, get rid of it. - What's up? - The correct answer is happy wife, happy life. - Hey! Fuck! - Everything fades away into a new reality. A new world. It is the bridge between us and years of physical evolution. Control your fear and embrace the possibilities of a better living.. ...better past.. ...a better future. Control your fear embrace the possibilities of a better now better past a better future. Fuck! Ah! - Hey, Lou, wanted to see how you're doing. Gimme a call. Love you. - Hey, Lou, you coming out tonight? Need a ride? Call me. - Hey, Lou, I haven't heard back from you. Just wanted to make sure you were okay. - Lou, this is Dave from united collections. You're kinda past due and the grace period is past. Please call us back at.. - Uh. Fuck! Uh. Okay. Fuck! Ah! Fuck! Can I help you? - You don't remember me, do you? My name's lorna, we met at the motel. - What are you doing here? - Can I -- can I come in? - Yeah, I'm sorry, man this just isn't a really good time. The place is a mess. - Well, it's cold as hell out there, okay? You been off your feet long? - Yeah, uh, about a week. Uh, what are you, are you a doctor? - No, no, I'm not a doctor. - A cop? - No, no. No. No, I'm not, I'm not a cop. I'm -- I'm lorna. - What are you doing here? - I.. I -- I wanna help. - Uh-huh, to help? - Are you having difficulty remembering things? Missing time? - I, yeah.. Well, yeah. All the time I'm missing. - Are you getting headaches? You experiencing fatigue? - Look, lady, uh, what's all the questions, man? - You feel like, uh, like somebody switched the channel and it's, it is like static, right? But the volume's cranked up high. It's like, it feels like that, right, right? And, and, and every once in a while you'll get a flash a fragment of an image or a a -- a word will squeeze past the barrier but it's lightning fast and then it's gone. It's nothing you can sink your teeth into. It's -- it's kinda like that, do you feel like that? Yeah? - Uh.. ...maybe. - When I try to remember.. Oh, fuck. I -- I get pummeled with these crippling headaches and, uh.. Yeah, they won't help me. They -- they wouldn't. They wouldn't tell me squat. - It stinks. Don't smell that. - You -- you -- you okay? - Ow, fuck, man. I just, uh, overslept a bit, uh, so.. And I'm not feeling so hot, as you can see. - When'd you go to sleep? - Uh, what day is it? - It -- it's Thursday. - Right, uh.. Yeah, so it's like, uh...Three days. - You wanna get something to eat, hon? - Uh...Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You okay? - Oh, yeah. - Lived out there long? - Well, it's my dad's place. He lived there for a bit, then, uh then he went off the deep end and now he's dead. - Sorry to hear that. - It's not such a big deal, i barely knew the guy. He wasn't really cut out to be a dad, or soldier. - He was military? - Uh, army. - I was enlisted. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. You ever do any training? - Me? - Mm-hmm. - Training? What, in the army? - I -- I did. - I don't think I'm cut out for that shit. - None, you didn't do any? - What about you, you see any, uh, action any life-changing shit? - Yeah, I worked in radar. They stick us in a truck most of the time out in some remote location. We code and ran radio waves for military aircraft. - That sounds boring. - Yeah, well, they were happy to see me go. - Why, what'd you do? - What did I do? Hmm, that's a good question. Okay. Okay, there were four of us. And we were stationed in this utility vehicle. We were running maneuvers and then our signal...Jammed. We were blinded by this, this, this blue light it was really bright. It kind of like, it vibrated you know, with this, like like this low hum? So we're all freaking out, start running and then...Just bam I'm like face down in the dirt. And, um, yeah, you know that's the last thing i remember. - What happened? - Well, they wouldn't say. Once I started asking, asking questions. Once I started, uh, you know seeing things that I didn't, i didn't know like, even fucking existed. Yeah, well, that was the end of my military career. - How'd you find me? What is this, you followed me from the motel? - No, you know, when someone has a trauma, their, uh.. ...their mind and their body, it leaves a.. It's like an imprint or a, like a scar in the psychic atmosphere. That's how I found you. It was -- it was waving like a flag. - Well, I definitely been seeing some shit. I don't know if I believe in telepathy or whatever weird tarot cards you're dealing in, lady. But, um, whenever i try to think of that night I just hit this block, you know? - Yeah. - Like, uh.. - Um, do you like the food here? - Warren works here. - Yeah. Can you trust him? - I don't know. Can I trust you, lorna? - No. If I'm right, these people are dangerous. This has my lab written all over it. - This is the funzone, alright? It's not a spaceship. Just try to be cool, keep a low profile, you know? It's a family establishment. - Okay. Your bastard science works to sever the bridge in between the body and mind. That way they can do terrible things to us without anyone ever knowing. This world is full of wisdom. Nobody ever questions it. Worse, we're killed... By our own species corruption. I was abducted... By a secret us contingent because I had been exposed to something, huh? Something they were struggling to understand and they responded with violence and fear. And I am not the only one. When someone has an encounter certain...Psychic muscles are strengthened. And you can see things other people can't. - So, you're a psychic. - No. Um.. I'm just saying you become more sensitive is all, hmm? You -- you think of it as having interdimensional street smarts. And, right now.. ...I'm getting a bad feeling from this place. - There he is. Let's get this cocksucker. - Lou, what are you doing here? - Hey, buddy. Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt your party. - Who's that? - Oh, this is lorna. Watch out, you know. The third eye will see right through you, bozo. - I'm gonna take a break, alright? We can hang out a minute. Wanna get high? - No. Look at me, Warren, okay? I'm already pretty fucked up, right? - Okay. Come on. Well, I guess, congratulations? I mean, I -- I didn't even know you were with someone? - Well, I'm not, asshole. - Well, uh, I -- I don't know what you want from me. I'm not the father. - Look, I just need to know what I'm dealing with, man. - What you're dealing with? I mean, you're pregnant. I mean, you can just get it taken care of or whatever. - I know what a fucking abortion is, alright? I'm not fucking pregnant. I'm some kind of goddamn freak show. You know? So. Come on, I know you were there that night. Just tell me what happened. - He told me to take you to them. - Who? - Gabriel. - Alright, so what, man? So, you're still doing runs for him? - Well, yeah, you know, he's got these photos of me. - Alright, alright, alright. What kind of photos? - Oh, just these photos of some girl -- - what's this have to do with Lou, hmm? - Look, he's in tune with this guy. - What guy? - What does this have to do with me? - I don't know, some guy came to town and he found Gabriel and he's trading him girls for drugs. - What's his name, this fucking pervert? - Oh, man, let me ask you a question, alright? Like -- like what the fuck did you think Gabriel's gonna do with me, huh? - Look, Lou, I'm sorry. I didn't know what they were up to. I just, I just thought we were making some money. - Oh, you wanna make money off of this? Come on. What am I supposed to do? - We need a name, yeah. We need a name! Oh, I -- I only heard Gabriel call him Isaac. - Isaac. Alright, that's better. - But, Lou, you gotta try and lay low 'cause Gabriel's got people in tune for all kinds of shit. You know, they're peeping everywhere. - It's kinda hard to lay low right now. Alright, 'cause I'm walking around with a fucking growth. You know? Like, nobody fucked me, you know? - Okay, I get it, I get it. Just.. Jade's dead. - How did Jade die? - I don't know. But he's dead and Gabriel doesn't care. He doesn't care about you he doesn't care about fucking Sadie he doesn't care about anybody. - Fucking squirmy, fucking wormy, right? - Hey, I'm sorry. I.. - Oh, yeah. Fuck you, man. - Hey, Lou. Hey, Lou, I'm sorry, Lou. Fuck, shit, fuck, fuck. - I haven't seen her in a couple days. - I need you to check on her. - It's kind of a drag to drive up there at night. - Yeah, but Isaac is worried. - I'm not interested in anyone, Gabriel, okay? Just need you to make money. You don't even know this guy. Just shows up and wants girls. Doesn't even fuck 'em. - Seems like an easy turnaround. - And what does he want them for? - I don't care what he wants them for, Sadie. They're fucking runaways. - Now, what? - Says he's almost done getting really close. - Close to what? This guy's using you just like the marines did. You're just too thick to see it. - You think I'm thick? - No, I don't. - You really think this lawyer is gonna help you find your kid? - I can pay him. - And then what? What makes you think he's even gonna wanna see you? Is he even gonna remember you? I mean, how long has it been? What have you been saying lately? You're 35...37. - Shut up, Gabriel. - If you wanna see him.. ...finish this, go check on Lou. - Yeah, do you remember, um, what they looked like? We know, okay, we know there's more than one because Warren said "them," right? - Alright, look, i don't know, okay? I don't know, I don't know who the fuck Isaac is, alright? I'm sick of trying to fucking remember, you know? - Yeah, i-- I -- I know what you're feeling, Lou. You know, I know -- I know.. I know what abuse is, huh? - I'm a mess. - And -- and I know what it looks like. And -- and, ahem, and I know you wanna -- you wanna leave. You know? I -- I know you want to avoid these realities. But, uh, Lou, y -- uh, you need to take control of your experience, you know? You -- you -- you really can't hand it over to them. - Just do me a favor, would ya? Just don't talk to me about vibes, okay? I'm having a hard enough time just managing my fucking experiences, okay, right here. This dimension or whatever the fuck you fucking hippie shit. - Alright? - Oh, what's happening? - Um, you -- you -- you aren't pregnant, Lou. See? - What is that? - There -- there was a a small foreign object. I -- I could see it. It was -- it was, like slightly raised beneath my skin. It was, like, an oval bean but it was, it was stretched slightly. And it -- it, um, it -- it had magnetic properties. I don't know how it got there. You know, there was no scar, just this -- this lump under my skin. And -- and -- and it was, it was mine. But they, uh... They strapped me down. They cut me open and they stole it. When they removed this implant from me it had started fusing to my nerves. - I don't know. Umm. It sounds like a nightmare, dude. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's fucking messed up. I gotta piss. - I'm just saying. They -- they thought I had been exposed to other technologies languages, even. - What are you talking about? What do you mean, like outer space? - Yeah, an alien race. - Uh, listen, alright, listen, i don't -- I don't talk about aliens when I'm getting high, alright, man? I have a strict policy, alright? Just don't do it. - Yeah, well, you know, you -- you can forget this bullshit of outer space because these men they're willing to kidnap and cut open their own people searching for secrets, so even if you don't believe they do and they won't stop, Lou. I mean, they're never gonna stop. - Alright. Well, ugh! Uh. Ah. You know what, uh, I'd be happy to let them cut this shit outta me right now. Right? I don't care what they use it for. - I -- I don't know who these -- these men are but, uh, you know, they -- they wanna control us because, uh.. ...be -- because... You know, they're scared. - What? They're scared? - Yeah, they -- they can't accept something they don't understand. - Uh...Whatever this is.. ...it feels very real, you know? Very inside the dimensions... Of this body. - Yeah. Yeah. - Man. I could really go for an out of body experience right now. - Yeah, yeah. Well, why -- why don't I clean up your foot for you, huh? - Yeah. - Okay. - That duct tape's gonna be a bitch. - It's okay. Okay, okay, you try to rest, honey. - Yeah? - You try to rest. Sorry. There you go, there you go, there you go. - Ah! - Sorry, sorry. Oh, honey. - Lou! Hello? I didn't realize you had company. - Neither did I. - Sorry, I -- I -- I didn't mean to fall asleep last night. I hope that's okay. - I brought you some, uh, donuts. And, uh, there's coffee with that whipped cream crap that you like. - Hi, I'm lorna. - How do you know Lou? - Uh, we met at the motel. - When's the last time you saw Warren? - I don't know, at the party, why? Look, Lou, I heard -- I haven't heard from you in a few days. I thought you might like just a little pick-me-up, you know? - I don't know, man. Look at me. - You know, maybe Gabriel knows a guy someone who's seen something like this before. - Yeah, I don't think anyone's seen something like this before. - I'll tell you right now. I don't want anything to do with Gabriel. You know, what. I told you not to get involved with him. - Well, do you want me to bring you to the hospital? I mean, maybe you should see, like, a real doctor. - Don't go, they'll lock you up. - I'm going back there. - Where? - I'm going back there, whatever happened to me happened to me that night at the party and nobody's telling me the fucking truth. - Oh, I'll -- I'll drive. That's a good idea. - I'm coming. - Yeah, you guys party here a lot, huh? - Yeah. No one bothers you out here. Alright, I remember coming here with you, Sadie. Shut the fuck up! - You were pretty messed up by the time we got here, Lou. - Where did Warren take me? - Try to remember, Lou. You need to look past those screened memories. - What the hell's she talking about? - You need to regress back to that night. You know, what state were you in. - She was wasted, lorna. That's the state that she was in. - Lou, you're pregnant. I don't know what you think you're gonna find here. - Man, come on. I'm not pregnant, Sadie. I'm infected. - Lou, it's fucking cold, can we just go, please? You need to accept this. Every pregnancy's different. - No. I can't accept this shit, you know? Man, whatever is inside of me is infecting my brain, my body. Okay, it's not just in my crotch. So, uh Warren said Jade had some killer shit. Right? And now, he's dead. - Wait, Jade's dead? - Come on. I saw Warren, Sadie. - Yeah, Warren's a pervert. He sleeps with teenage girls, you can't trust him. - Right, right, right. A -- and Gabriel just makes money off of them so...What does that make him? - He's not doing that anymore. He's been only handling special clients for a minute. High end people. Richer people who can pay for specifics. - Yeah? Like Isaac? - Who? Look, I don't know, Lou. You know? I, I stay out of his business. Look, I don't want anything to do with this shit. - Warren told me, Sadie. He told me Gabriel's working on something big. And you're telling me you don't know anything about it? - About what? - I didn't have sex with anyone, Sadie. - This is crazy, Lou. - Lou, Lou. Lou! Lou! - Keep the fucking plastic closed. Undo her fucking pants. - What's the matter? - Yeah, she's ready. - Lou, Lou, Lou. - What did you see, huh? - It was Gabriel. - Gabriel wasn't here that night. - You're lying, Sadie. Let her speak. - Just cut the shit, Sadie. - Look, I thought he was just in it for the money. I don't wanna know where he gets his shit, I don't wanna know. - What, what, what shit, huh? - Don't be dumb. Whatever the cheapest high is you know, whatever fucks him up the fastest. He wanted to get fucked up, but they run out of money so Gabriel has to, he has to find something cheaper. - And so what, Sadie? He just has no idea where it comes from? - Yeah, he's a, he's a killer. - No, Gabriel wouldn't touch the stuff. He needed a Guinea pig and.. - A -- are you fucking kidding me? - Okay, so a Guinea pig for what? - Man.. ...you knew, Sadie. - Yeah, well, I figured you wouldn't even notice. - Well, I noticed, man. You know, i really definitely, like big time fucking noticed, Sadie. - I didn't know, Lou. - Yeah. Yeah, well.. You knew. You just didn't care, right? - Hey! That's it. Okay. - Lou? Lou? Lou! Lou! Lou! - Oh, fuck! - It's time. Okay. - What, what is -- - I'm gonna get this thing outta you. Listen! Listen! - What? - We're gonna get this outta you. But we need to work together. - Yeah. - Okay. Look at me, focus, okay? Rip it! Rip it! - Okay! - Good girl, good girl. - Well, who is this lady? - I don't know, some spaced-out mama. She's filled Lou's head with nonsense. - Where were they going? - I don't know, they fucking left me there, Gabriel. This has gone too far. - Oh, this has gone too far. What are you gonna do, you still want that money? - Don't act like you're doing this for me. - What the fuck is that supposed to mean? - I know you get off on this shit, messing with these girls. - There are always people getting dirty, Sadie. People getting used up, people getting eaten up and I am just trying to stay on top. - On top of what? You don't know this guy, you don't know what he's up to and you can't sell to people if they're dead. - We're gonna let this freak burn me? If Lou's still alive, then she can handle the effects and I can sell it. - I don't see that. She's not just big, she's fucked up, okay? - It's an experimental hormone supplement for women. It's discontinued from some lab he worked in. You have the right amount you get a good high, a quick euphoria. - You've gotta do something. I don't know this lady lorna. What if she grabs Lou and takes her out of town? Then what? I mean, what happens to Lou? - Well, no one's getting outta here. He wants us to take her in. - It's time, it's time, Lou. We're gonna put you in bed. - Okay. - We're gonna get this outta you. Okay, okay, Lou, you need to push. - It's pulling me apart. - Go, go, go, go! Good, good, take another breath. Push, Lou, push, good girl! Lou, I can see something! - Oh! Oh, fuck! Oh, god! - Oh, look, Lou. Look what you did. Hello, hi. Whatever you are. Hi, Lou. Oh, hi.. Oh, my goodness. No! No! - No! Lorna! - Lou! No! - No! - Up! - You can breathe now. - Is that, is that what you came for? - What the fuck is that thing, man? - It's the beginning. Shh.. Go to sleep. - I don't wanna breathe that shit in, man. - Rest, little baby. That's right. - I'm sorry, i don't wanna be rude, uh.. Did you want one? - What kind of life do you wanna continue living, Lou? - Uh, I don't know. Uh, maybe one without you nagging me all the time. - Would you just keep getting stoned and watching TV until it's all a blur? - I sure as fuck didn't sign up for this shit. - What the fuck have you ever signed up for, Lou? - Who the fuck are you? Fucking prick. - You motherfuckers. - Stay down! - You fucking idiots! You're too stupid to know what you've done. You push, you harass, you terrorize you cut us open like fucking lab rats. - You're fucking crazy! - Yah! - You don't need her anymore, Isaac. She's a fucking mess, let's just get rid of her. - It's just a head. But it's the most significant form of tissue we've been able to generate. - Well, man, I don't know what to tell you, you know? I guess I've just always been a real overachiever. - You're a wonderful candidate for their terrain. - How the fuck is she wonderful? - I've been there, Lou. - So, you've been to space a bunch? - It's a terrible place. Their atmosphere is too toxic for a human to survive. But years of abuse have provided your womb with the perfect level of toxins necessary for this conception. - Thank you. - You should be proud, Lou. - I am fucking proud, you know? Gotta get it while you can. - Come on, Lou. There's so much more we could do. - Alright, just stop. - Whoa, whoa. - Come on, Lou. - What? What, yeah? Will you fucking stop? Slow the fuck down, alright? - Don't be fucking stupid, Lou. - It's my life, it's my terms. - Give me the knife. - With your body, we can create a new race that will allow us to supply an everlasting demand for submission. - Do this again and again, man? You're insane. - Gimme the knife. - Oh! Fuck! God! Fuck!
