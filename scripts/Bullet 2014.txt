You got me the bread? You like lasagna? Alright, come on out of there. Get your hands where I can see 'em! Put your hands where I can see them. You're under arrest. Come on. Slow. Come on out. Out now! Get on the ground! Get on the ground. You! Out now! Fuck! Holy shit! You fucking shot the cops, man! What are you doing?! You just shot the cops, man! Shut up. Get the money. Get the money.

Put it down over there. Set the other one here. Alright. Sit on it. What the fuck for, man? It's called a Mexican interrogation. Now sit on it, gringo. Who knew about the buy? I don't know, man. I thought maybe they followed you here. Fuck! You know, I love assholes like you. You know why? NO. Why? 'Cause you make good targets. Fuck! What are you trying to do, man? Why don't you just kill me now? Sit down! What are you doing?! Now, I got two bodies back at the trailer. One more ain't gonna make a difference. Who knew about the buy? If I tell you, he's gonna kill me. Alright? If I tell you, he's gonna kill me. Look, you gotta... You gotta promise me you're gonna get me somewhere safe. Last chance. One, two... Ahh! Fuck This! Fuck it! It was Carlito! Carlito, man. Carlito Kane. Fuck this! See now, that wasn't so hard, was it? I didn't do it. Where you going? You're so bad. Dinner's on me if you beat me. I can think of better ways to work up a sweat. Later. But you gotta catch me first. Stop! Beat you. Alright. You win. Hey! Hey! Hey! Bullet. You're up next. A thousand? You're playing for the wrong team, Frank. Take a dive. Make it easier on yourself, you know? You're running six to one anyway. Good odds. Are you having a good time tonight? Here comes one of your favorites. You know him. You love him. Make some noise for the people's champ... ...Jake the Tank! A real contender. Make some noise! Right now, here comes the challenger. Now, he looks a little beat up, but I guarantee he can still kick some ass in the cage! Let's hear it for Frank "Bullet" Marasco! I've been waiting a long time for this, Bullet. I got a little gift from San Quentin for you. Alright guys, I want a fair and clean fight. Alright? You know a good dentist, Tank? Why? That's why. Get up! Damn it. Let's go. It's time. Next time ain't gonna be no six to one. Let's not have a next time. Don't come back. I'm reporting outside of the San Quentin State Prision, where 40 year old Manuel Kane, best known for being the only son of suspected cartel leader Carlito Kane, is being prepared for execution. Kane was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of three Los Angeles police officers who participated in a coordinated raid on one of the cartel's safe houses. In a few moments, the state of California will carry out Manuel Kane's execution by lethal injection. Out of the van! C'mon. Get out of the truck. Hey! Hey! Leave her alone! Governor Johnson, may I introduce you to Maria? Governor, I wanted to thank you so much for your support. Could you excuse me one minute? Hi, Jess. How's it going? Jess... Honey... What happened? Jess... ...What's this? ... It's Jessie. I'm going to be quick because time is running out for all of us. Order a 72 hour stay of execution for Manuel Kane now. Who are you? I've got no time for questions. Order a 72 hour stay now. I've got to have good reasons to even stay a man's execution. Hmm... Really? Oh, God! Is that enough of a reason? Do you think I'm joking? Is that serious enough for you? Do it now or your daughter is next. Craig, do what he says. Do what he says. The State of California hereby sentences Manuel Kane to death by lethal injection. Any last words? I'll see you in hell. Leroy! What the hell? How'd you like our performance? I thought it was pretty good, huh. It was good. Hey, don't feel bad. You just got punked. Which I think is a little more pleasant than what they're going to do to you in prison. Yeah, alright. Get your Oscar speeches ready, boys. Man, this shit is freakin' illegal, man. I want my lawyer now. Look. I want details, Leroy. Well, then you must be crazy. He'll kill me, you know. You're out of your mind, man. Kane will kill me. Don't you guys know already? Don't nobody mess with the Kane. I want my lawyer. Hey, your lawyer has been notified. Now let me tell you something, okay. And you listen. And you listen real good, you worthless piece of shit. You've got two alternatives. Number one. You give us Kane. And we put him away for a long time. Number two. You don't give us Kane. And we put the word out you snitched. Ah! N~ Ah! Yeah. We put the word out you snitched. Gave us his whole pipeline. And uh... I'll give you... maybe... ...a week? Yeah, maybe. A week? A week? A week, best, before he finds you and kills you. So your best bet... option number one. Man, you're bluffing, man. People saw me come in here. People know I'm here. Yeah, you're right. You're bluffing! You're right. Only one way to find out. We're gonna go get coffee. You do what you got to do. Okay, okay, okay, okay- I didn't mean that. I didn't mean that. I-I changed my mind. I'll give you what you need. My charge can get reduced, right, if I do this? You guys are gonna work with me. That's what they say. You're gonna work with me. You start writing. We'll see what we can do. Yes, sir. Lukas Kruger. Kane's right-hand man. Is he talking? Eh... More like whining. But he signed it. How'd you get him to sign this? You don't want to know that, Captain. You're right. I don't want to know. But Leroy said that uh... Kane has something big going down in the A.M. So it looks like we'll be doing an all-nighter. Works out of a art studio downtown. Kruger. I want the gorilla, not the monkey. One animal at a time, Captain. Man, you really had Leroy snitchin' like a little bitch. All day, brother. Detective, I want to see what my client just signed. Wait a minute. What'd you just say? I said I want to see what my client just signed. Wow. Leroy must be doing pretty well for himself. Pricey lawyer like you... Don't fuck with me, Marasco. You had no business having him sign an affidavit without me there. He signed it on his own. Look, the affidavit is on file at the clerk's office. You want a copy, I'm sure they'll give it to you. But as for me... I'm running late, sweetheart. Merde! Special Agent Daehn. So what can we do for you, Special Agent Daehn? I'm here to talk about the ongoing investigation of the Kane cartel. What, the feds need our help? Usually us local cops are in the way. Well, actually the Attorney General wants to investigate new evidence that might lead to Manuel Kane's innocence. You took him down, detective. Do you have any idea what this evidence could be? Sure... Non-existent. I caught Kane red-handed. He's guilty as hell. And the men he killed... were good cops and friends. Okay, well, this could just be a last-ditch legal effort, but... ...we'd still like to review any files you may have on Kane. All my files on Kane... they're all up here. Heh. And no psych in his right mind would go in there unarmed. Okay, well um... Would you mind if I shadowed him on the investigation? I hear you have quite the reputation, detective. Look, shadow me all you want. But when I turn a corner, my shadow disappears. And I ain't no fuckin' babysitter. So, we're on then at twelve. Stay in your own lane, Agent. Special Agent. Is he always this grumpy? Grumpy? He was actually in a good mood. Great. Well, thank you. I'd like to speak to this man privately, please. You listen to me clearly. You can tell your father that if anything happens to my daughter, I will personally escort you both to hell. I will track you down using my last penny to the last day. Like the dogs that you are. And I don't care if they have to execute me. I've accepted my fate. Have you, Governor? My daughter... is my whole world to me. It's a dangerous man, whose very meaning for existence is threatened. Remember that. Yes, Governor. And you remember... My father and I... We're the only bloodline left in this shit world. You do your part; we all get what we want. Comprende? Yes. Good. Soon you'll get the information you need to release me. Guards! Get me out of here. Great art claims to understand death. But, y'know... It's not until you've looked down the barrel of a gun... ...that you truly understand the meaning of death. This country was founded by thieves and murderers, religious fanatics... social misfits. But you know what those misfits did, the first chance they got? They dumped their Bible and picked up a gun. This country is built on the barrel of a gun, not a fucking constitution. There shouldn't be stars on the flag, there should be guns. We are the poor with guns. And you stand in our way and we will fuck you up! And when you steal from that, you're not just fucking with me, you're fucking with the American dream. Where is my fucking money? Death before dishonor. Now was that bravery... ...or just simply freakin' stupidity? As the man said, where's the money? Get him on his feet. Now you crawl back to Finn and you tell him he has one week. We've got cops. Scheisse. All this freakin' drama for nothing. Tarvis, the door! Too late, obviously. Yeah. Drop your weapons! Lock down the back! Lock down the back! Go ahead. I'll take care of them. I'll take the back. Die, you fucker! Die, fucker! Drop your weapon! Oh, really, you little cunt? Drop your weapon right now! Put your weapon down now! Right now! Put your hands on top of your head. Hands on your head! Don't fucking move! Yeah, yeah. Fuck. Don't... Goodbye, adieu, auf wiedersehen. Fuck! Should've shot him. I didn't ask to get bailed out, alright. I was doing alright by myself, okay. Where's the cop? Shouldn't have gone against my counsel, Leroy. I-I didn't go against your counsel. I had to call in a favor from our new friend, the governor... ...to get your agreement revoked. The governor? Mm-Hmm. Now what? Get in, shitcake. A-After you. Merci. Press lobby. You shoud've kept your mouth shut. Welcome, ratte. Come, come, come. Alright, take it easy. I should be getting home. I had no choice, Mr. Kane. I swear to God! This fucking cop, he tricked me, alright. He was gonna kill me, Mr. Kane. Please listen to me. Lie down. Please. Lie down. What for? Just lie down. 'An. ...am gonna need you to lie very, very, very still. Open your mouth. Good. Aw. You're moving, Leroy. C'mon, hold still. And did I tell you to hold still, Leroy? I heard you but it-it dropped out. I did. I told you to hold still and you didn't. You ruined my shot, Leroy. You son of a bitch! I told you... ...to hold still! Fuck. Welcome everyone to Narcotics Anonymous. This is a fellowship for us to help encourage and share our recovery experience while supporting one another and carrying our message to others. Let's start with the Serenity Prayer. God, grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change. Sorry I'm late. I don't want to hear it. I asked you for one thing. I thought you'd care enough to put work aside. I know it's important. I'm really sorry. We have a very special birthday tonight and it's for someone that we've... we've watched walk through the steps this year. And uh... is a shining example of how to stay sober one day at a time. And that one year chip is for Vanessa, for her birthday. And it's going to be given to her by Frank. Come on up. Um... Hi, my name is Vanessa. I'm an addict. Hi, Vanessa. Uh, I don't have much to say but um... I really thankful for my sobriety and... Keep coming back. It works. My name is Frank and I'm an addict. Hey, Frank. And... tonight my daughter is taking the one-year chip. And I'm really sorry I had to put her through all the stuff I put her through. But I thank my higher power that I was here when she was ready to get clean. And remember, work the steps, because the elevator is broken. So now are we good? We' re okay. "Good" might be pushing it. Hey, look. You're gonna learn in the meetings that just because somebody gets sober and clean, it doesn't mean they're not assholes. Well... I'm a perfect example of that. Yeah, well, you are an asshole, but you're the only parent I got, so... And I'm the only grandparent that Mario's got. Here, now this is for you. No, no. Stop it, it's too much. Don't be silly. Besides, what am I gonna do, have lap dances? Don't be silly. I love you. Thank you. This is gonna help a lot. Now me and Mario are still on for tomorrow? Yes. Remember, noon. Not 2:30. Not 1:39. Noon. Noon. Thank you. Come in. Hey, hey- Hey, Dad. Hi, baby. Grampa! What's up, buddy? Here. For you. Hi. Hey. Whoa! A Wikipad. This so cool! Wow. Can I see it? This is really nice... No. Dad, these gifts. They have to stop, please. This is the newest... The biggest thing there is right now. We got a date with the park, buddy. Let's go. Can I bring it? No, you'll get it all full of sand. Thank you. ...Bye. ... Bye, Mom. Unbelievable... I told those boys you're a policeman, but they didn't believe me. Come I show them your badge? Sure, but don't lose it, because my boss will fire me. Yes! My god! I think that woman is being attacked. ...fuck away from me! Get off of me. Fuck you! Get off of me! Fuck... Help! Help! Help me! Help! Shut up! Help! Hold it! Hey! Hey. What... Relax, relax. Stay right there! Just listen. Hey! What the fuck are you guys doing? We ain't doing shit, man! That's our homegirl. We're just playing around, dog. Alright? Calm down, homeboy. Yeah, playing around you gonna get your head blown off. Get the fuck outta here! Alright, alright. Whoa. Relax, dog. Shit... C'mon guys! Mario! The little boy in the blue and gray shirt, have you seen him? No... Mario! Mario! Mario! Mario! Yeah. If you wish to see your grandson alive, meet me at the Third Street bridge tonight. 9 PM. No cops, just you. You understand? Look, whoever you are. If you hurt that kid, I will hunt you down and I will kill you in the worst way. Heh, heh. Yeah. You remember. Third Street bridge. 9 PM. He was kidnapped. I was distracted for a minute and somebody took him. One day. One lousy day and this is what happens? Explain, explain! Please, please tell me how you just leave my child. Wh-What... How... What do you mean bad guys took him? What does that... What does that fuckin' mean? No, no. These people, they're bad people. They'll... Hello, 911? Don't you understand? We can't. We have to do what they say. Now I will get him back. I will get him back. Fuck. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Yung. We'll see you next Thursday. Let's get this... Okay... Excuse me... please. I heard about your little visit to San Quentin this morning. Was that part of the instructions? No. There are things a father can imagine happening to his daughter that are worse than death. And whatever the worst you can imagine, I make it happen everyday. One more mistake... and the worst happens. God! How could I be so stupid? Why do you think they're doing this? It's probably because I'm the governor's daughter. Really? Your dad is the governor? M)' grampa is a cop. Here you go. Dinner's ready. ErlJ'Y' Get in. You. You expecting someone else? Where's my grandson? Safe... for now. But if my son is executed, your baby boy is gonna join him. Three years ago, your testimony put my son in prison. Your new testimony is gonna get him released. What's this? A legal document. Where you officially recant your testimony against Manuel Kane. Your son murdered three cops. It's gonna be tough covering that up. Hmm... Look closer. You want me to say I killed 'em? You were taking money from Manuel Kane... ...to turn a blind eye from some of his business affairs. When the investigating officers found out about it you killed them and blamed it on him. A very selfish thing to do. No one is gonna believe it. Well for your grandson's sake, you better hope they do. And when that gets to the governor and he pardons my son, we'll turn Mario over to his mother. How do I know you'll release him? Trust me. And thank you, Detective. Oh. Oh, yes. Um... There is one more thing. This is awkward. We should've told Detective about this first. We're going to need you to sign this as well. Kruger, here, will help you with the execution. "I have made a terrible mistake. " What the hell is this? "I can no longer live with my guilt. " This is a suicide note! Fuck you! Marasco, I think you're the one who's fucked. You have a chance to offer up your wretched existence as a sacrifice for your grandson. You die. He lives. That simple. Gimmie the pen. What's that they say about revenge? It's best served cold... ...like your soon-to-be corpse. No, I was thinking about that other one. How's it go? An eye for an eye. You stop it! You stop it! You turn around! You go back and get him! So, you wanna play chicken? Get out of the car! Get out of the car! Show me your hands! Hey, man. Fuck! I've got to go to the hospital, man. Yeah, I'm hurt, man. I'm hurt, okay? Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Show me your hands! F-Fuck you, fucking asshole! I'll kill you, asshole! Fuck you. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck! Let's get out of here. Hey, long time no see. Yeah. Hey. Can I just get my regular? Just the regular. Yeah. What you doin' tonight? Thanks. Wanna come play with us? ...No, I'm good. ... C'mon! No, I'm good. Whatever... Vanessa, pick up. Vanessa, I need to talk to you. It's important. Call me back. Vanessa! Vanessa! Oh, shit! 911, I need a R.A. unit. Yeah, drug overdose. Yeah. At 2105 Walton Place. Come on. Come on, baby. Yes. Connect me to the Attorney General. I know what time is goddamn it. Just do it. Let's hurry up. Hurry up. She's fading on us. Hurry up, hurry up. We're losing her. You need to see this. It's from the State Attorney General's office. This can't be true. It's a crock of shit. Ladies and gentlemen, we just received a direct order from the governor to apprehend Detective Frank Marasco. What? What the hell for? There's evidence to indicate that he was involved in the murder of three police officers. Excuse me, Captain. All due respect, but that's... I mean that's bullshit. There isn't a cop in this precinct that wouldn't put their life in Frank's hands. And you know it. Yeah, that's right. I understand that this is difficult for all of us to believe. But we've got orders from on high. So bring Frank in and let him clear his name. Go get him. That's an order. Baby, I'm so sorry. Querida, if you can hear me... Mario's alive. I'm gonna make sure he stays that way. How'd you know I was here? I'm good at my job. The governor ordered your arrest. You know that's bullshit. If you have any explaining, you can do it at the station. Don't use white lies on me. Raise your hands, Detective. What're you gonna do, shoot me? Don't move. Let's go to the station. You're gonna have to ask yourself... Do I trust him? Sometimes... it's not by the book. It's not in your head, it's in your gut. Feel it. Let's just go back to the station. Detective! This isn't the wild west. Let me help you. You can't. Stay out of my way. Bullet, come on. Shit. Alright. Sorry, mister. Sorry, sorry. Don't... I know cops go bad sometimes, but... ...it's bullshit. Frank's no cop killer. Yeah, there's no way. And what the hell do they even have on him? Good day, Detective. Have a seat. You made my friend, Kruger, very unhappy. I didn't sign this last night, and I'm not signing it now. So if you came for a killing, let's get to it. Heh. We will. I promised Kruger here the honors. It's the life you can save that'll give you the impetus to sign. Hey, hey, there's movement. You think he slipped in without us seeing? One-teen-ninety to dispatch. Be advised. Marasco's in his apartment. We're gonna need backup. Respond code two. Tell 'em to come easy. Let's go. You know, judging by your actions last night, you don't fully appreciate the danger your grandson is in. I'm not a nice man, Detective. You've read my file. I do horrible things to people. Men, women, children. Mario won't be an exception. Get the kid. Grampa, help please! Mario! You be strong. Go ahead. Take his fingers off. One, two... No! No! Wait, wait, wait! Please, please! Don't let them do this! Now you listen to me, Detective. I will take him apart one piece at a time. One finger at a time. You sign it. Thanks for signing. Let's just try and see if we can get him to come out. We gotta try to take him in easy. Okay - Any last words? Just two... "Fuck" and "you"! Hey Frank. Estes, Tarvis... Come on out, man. We just wanna talk to ya. Come on out. We just wanna talk. Come on out, Frank. It's Estes, Tarvis... We just wanna talk. Hey Frank, it's Tarvis, man. We know you didn't do anything. Come out and talk to us. Whoa, whoa, hey. What are you doing? Easy. We told 'em to come easy. They' re gettin ' away. Frank, drop your gun. Frank, drop your gun now! They're gettin' the fuck away! Drop your gun... now! They' re gettin ' a... Get him. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! They' re gettin ' away! Get their uniforms. Governor Johnson. Alright, I've got your confession. I delivered you your man to the cops. Now let my son out. Listen, the pardon is still in a process. It has to go through judicial... No. Wait, wait, wait, stop. You don't understand. I don't want excuses. You make it happen. Don't be an asshole for God's sake! I'm just a governor. I want it done just as fast as you do. I want my daughter back. Then you better use all the influence you have on those judges. Because if my son's not released by noon tomorrow, your baby girl is worse than dead. No, listen. I just need some time! We don't... Goddamn it! Fuck! I've got to give it to him. He's thorough. Take a look at this. What is it? A suicide note. He wanted to kill Marasco- make it look like a suicide. Insurance against the confession. Yeah, suicide note... It's gotta be a stitch up. I didn't even know Marasco could write. Let me tell you something. I know Frank. He's no cop killer. You almost got it? Almost there. Just a little closer. I'm trying Princesa Durmiente! Wake up! Get the kids in the van. We need to leave now. I was awake. Yeah, sure. We're gonna take a little journey. Ah! Ow! So how long have they had him? Too long. 1:45 yesterday. I'm sorry, Frank. I should've known. We all should've. Well... shoot. That ain't gonna get my grandson back. We gotta do something. Yeah. Looks like the governor is coming up with the attorney general. Kane is getting desperate. He means what he says, Mr. Governor. I fear that if Manuel Kane is executed, the same will happen to your daughter. I'm betting Mario will be next. Now, I've gotten several of these in the last few days. It doesn't excuse my actions. Or lack of action. I take full responsibilty for the death of four good cops. And detective... I believe you have the right... He's gonna kill her. You know that, don't you? I can't let that happen. We have to do the right thing. Well, you send in a posse, you might as well put a gun to both them kids' heads. I know... So what do we do? We don't do anything. And what I'm gonna do... you don't want to know. I won't be needing that, Captain. Okay, pretty naked lady. Where's Kane? Get the fuck out of here or I will have your badge. You know, when people wake up in the morning, they see the sunshine. I wake up, I see the shit in the streets. And I gotta clean it up 'cause it's my job. And I like my job. Now you're a beautiful woman, Brook. But to me you're a piece of shit... ...that I gotta clean up. Now, where's Kane? I don't know. Okay! Where's Kane? I really don't know, I swear. Look, we can bob for apples all night. But I know you're lying. Where's Kane? Where's Kane? Okay, okay. Okay... I guess... The safe house in the desert. Four Aces. Thank you for your cooperation, counselor. Goddamn this shit! We're in America. Speak Mexican, bitch. Speedy, it's Bullet. Yeah, holmes. I'll be there in twenty. I need some presents. Bullet. What's up, holmes? I've got something for you. Yeah. I got you, holmes. C'mon. Bye, ladies. Bye, Speed)'- Look here. If you need me and the fellas, we got you, homie. Thank you, brother, but it's a one-man job. Thanks. Help yourself, brother. Frank, you can't do this alone. Kane is a very desperate man. Call me. Shit. Ah, damn it. Her father's a powerful man. Let's just see how far his love extends. Boss... You ought to get some sleep. Madison isn't answering. I think we should change locations. She knows where we are. You get the two kids ready. And then we load up everything. We could just leave them here. Goddamn it! I said get the kids ready. We're on our way to Mexico. Ow, ow! You're hurting. Ow! Hey! What's that? Pop the trunk. What the fuck? What's he doing here? Get outta there! Hey boss! We got problems. No, you got problems. Look at that. Shit, it's Bullet. That a question or a statement? Take that as a request. Alright, next card coming. Let's go. Hey, what the fuck's up with them eggs, huh? Fuck, man! Went to the damn grocery store or what! Fuck. Man, you guys can't do anything for yourselves. I'm out. That's it? Heh. Alright, next card coming, man. Yo, what's up with them eggs, huh?! Do this, do that. Where the fuck are the eggs? Sonny! Hey Sonny, where's the food? Sonny! Sonny! Sonny, you okay? Jesus Christ. What the fuck are we paying these stupid assholes for? Hey, let's go. You guys betting again, or what? Who's riding? Let's go. Next card. I wouldn't do that if I were you. It's all good, homie. I was just doing my job, man. You feel me? I'm just doing mine. Oh yeah? What you here for, huh? How much did he pay you to kidnap my grandson? That's what this is about, or what, huh? I tell you what, man. First of all, you've gotta relax, homeboy. Let me tell you something, man. We could help you out, but uh... What's it worth to you? Four bullets. Is that right? One, two, three, four. You! Hey, monkey. Grampa? Yeah, yeah. I told you it'd be all right. Eye for an eye! Turn around! Arschloch, arrest me. You have the right to shut up. Game over. Heh, heh. Not as smart as you thought. Heh, heh. Frank, I really like you. You are so German. Even when you are outnumbered, you keep on fighting. Very impressive... ...old man. Now say your prayers. Scheisse... Scheisse. Scheisse! You know how we say that in Mexican? Bang! Grampa, help! Grampa! Let my grandson go and I won't kill you. Always a funny line, Frank. It's over. Let him go. You drop the gun and I won't shoot the kid. I'm not leaving here without my grandson. I'll tell you what... Let's make it a real Mexican standoff, huh? You might've made one badass Mexican. Grampa! Grampa! Monkey, monkey. Boy, you were so brave. Come on. I knew you would come, Grampa. See, I told you he'd come back for us. Thank you so much, Mr. Marasco. I'm so glad you guys are okay. Let's get you two home. The state of California hereby sentences Manuel Kane to death by lethal injection. Let the execution begin. Hey, don't go too far! I-I love you, Dad. I love you too, baby. Hey Mom, check this out! What is it? I don't know but it's so cool. Check this out, Grandpa.
