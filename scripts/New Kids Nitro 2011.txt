Where'd you get that? - Where did I get that? Stole it from the cops. Yeah, right. I've seen this one. With the gun. That sketch on Comedy Central. New Kids is old. Only the first season was sweet, when you were still with Flabber. Is entertaining but you keep doing the same thing over and over. What happened to you? You're fucking boring. Of course, there it is: The car accident. Original. Sorry. - I could have come up with that. You don't even speak the Brabant dialect. You're actors. Is bullshit. And a sequel?

There's so much of it, they're handing out free milk in Friesland. Farmer Feike, do you think these cows will eventually stop producing milk? I do know that one cow has produced enough milk for the whole province. And Sietske and Aafke also licked that same stone, so... Every Friesian can come and get free milk here. Yes... Cheers!

For Chriss sake! Fuck my probation! Dave will be destroyed! Camera! Camera, come on. I'm here in Friesland in the farmyard... Where did this take place? Friesland. Friesland. Frieslan. Frieslan. And what is... I have no idea. Has this footage aired yet? - No. They were intercepted. The cameraman has been paid off. And they came up with a story for the public. No reason to panic. And in Friesland? Do we have anything... ...important there? Something... - No. So then... we will do... Nothing. Did you see Gerrie's father's face? What a little bitch. Go away. If you do that one more time, I'll take you in. Got it? Hello. Open up. - Death race, dude. What? - Death race. What are you saying? I can't hear you. If you don't open that door... - Rikkert and you race one more time. No rules, until death. Dude, are you out of your mind? Until death? Rikkert, you're the best driver. Everyone knows that. You will win for sure. And when Dave's dead the Manta will be yours again. You can't live without her, can you? You said it yourself. But what I meant was... Fine, dude. Death race! Fine, dude. Homo cop! So you took that car anyway? - Well, I was walking past it... You didn't take the car? - No, yes, I was walking... Goddammit, are you completely useless? Go get that car and arrest those guys. This is you last chance, understood? - Yes. Sir. - Sir. Is a decent car. Too bad the cops painted it. For Maaskantje, cunt. Nice. Ten... nine... eight... seven... ...six... five... four... ...three... two... Hands in the air. Hey, Adrie. Adrie, dude. Adrie, I'm not part of this, right? Don't move, Gerrie. - Yes, but... Don't move. What do you mean 'not part of this'? Adrie? You fucking snitch! We could use tape. Yes. We could put tape all around the Friesland borders. That way the problem will work itself out... ...and the rest of the Netherlands won't be at risk. There's nothing here, folks. Move along. I told you there's nothing here. Hello. No? Show me your ID cards. Hello. ID cards. Don't walk away. If you don't show me your ID cards right now... Any other ideas? Maaskantje? Those rubber bullets suck. - For Chriss sake. Look at my eye, dude. You're such a stupid cunt. Why did you do it? Remember when I got caught? With that water gun filled with piss? And those bikers? I didn't want to go to jail, because of my probation. So sometimes I call Adrie when I have some information. He also gives me confiscated fireworks sometimes, as a bonus. Just to be nice. Did anyone bring toilet paper by any chance? Hey, homos! I think I'll pay your mother a little visit. - Don't you dare. Corrie. Corrie. - Fucking cunt. I'll kill you No. I'll kill you! Calm down, young man, otherwise I'II... See you later. Mom, get out of Maaskantje. Is dangerous. Why? I feel great. I have so much energy. Listen to me, Mom. I can't tell you everything. But take the bus right now and try to get as far away from Maaskantje as you can. No, son. I'm staying here. Besides, I don't like to travel. You know that. Goddammit mom, listen. - Hold on. Someone is coming. Goddammit, who would come by on a Sunday? Hello? - Goddammit mom, listen to me! What are you doing damned homo cop? - Excuse me? We have to get out of here! Dave is with our mom. I know. What if we take my shirt... - Shut up, fucking snitch! What if we get a paperclip... - Shut up! Hey idiots, whas up? Craziness. What did you say? - Hey, how are you? Who are you? - Yes, of course. I know you, but you don't know me, of course. Funny. I work for the Ministry of Defense. We've been following you for a while from a distance. Yes. To make a long story short... We want you to help us out with a situation in the Friesland region. Are you crazy or something? - You are crazy, dude, cunt. We can supply you with guns... ...and we'll make sure you'll never have to work again. And you will be released immediately. - Fine, dude. Homos! Goddammit, Adrie. How could you let them get out? Yes, no, but those... OK, hand it over. You know the drill. You're fired. Again. There he is. Pete Crybaby. Mom? Ries! What happened to my house? Mom! Ronnie picked me up and we celebrated my health. Mom, you have to leave. Is not safe here anymore. Ronnie will take you to the bus station. - Will do. I'll make sure you get a ticket to Ameland. I'll book you a hotel, all inclusive. You deserve to get pampered. - You're so good to me. Mom... ...I don't say this often... Dave! He's coming. Over there. Where is he? - Be careful, dude. Thas Dave, dude. - Is a ping-pong table. I thought it was Dave. Are you completely useless? You fuck up everything. I couldn't even tell her that I love her, dude. Cunt. Homo. Dave, dude. Les finish this. Meet us at 4 p. m. Next to the highway, cunt. Heigh ho homos. Where are the Maaskantje homos. Heigh ho homos. There they are, the Maaskantje homos. You're going to die. Bring it on. Get AIDS, you fat cunts from Schijndel. Homosexuals. Deborah has a nice tight pussy. I dare you to say that again, dude, now that you still can. Nice tight pussy. We'll kill you. And your whole fucking village, goddammit! Stop it, people. Hi, I'm Anja from the Association Against Cursing. You're going too far, guys. Wouldn't it be nice if two rival groups, like you, entered into a discussion? Don't curse at each other. I can give an example... Is Roy really sticking that broken broom handle up her cunt? Whore. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? We have to wait here for the ferry to take us to beautiful Ameland. Fucking Friesland! - And I have a nice announcement to make. You can go stretch your legs outside for five minutes before we go on the ferry. Well folks, look at that. I think they want... Hey, cunt. Mom? - Ries! Mom! Mom! Thas a fucking great Knoepert, goddammit. The Knoepert, available at a snack bar near you. Is gigantic, dude. The manufacturers can't be held responsible for the effects... ...of the changing ingredients of the Knoepert. We are gathered here today... ...because we have lost a special human being. Corrie Batsbak, the mother of Richard Batsbak. Unfortunately, we can't bury her body... ...because it hasn't been found since the attack that took her life. In that place, Friesland. Corrie wasn't just my neighbor. Corrie and I, we really trusted each other. And Richard, your mother asked me to tell you this after her death. You never knew your father. There's a reason for that. Apart from the fact that he robbed your mother... ...while she was giving birth to you at the hospital... ...and fucked a lot of whores while he was still with your mother... Anyway, your father was... ...from Schijndel. So you are half Schijndelian. What kind of bullshit is that, dude? Well, look. Of course she was ashamed that she fucked someone from Schijndel. I'm going to get her body. This isn't a worthy funeral for such a good woman. So where are you going to look? - In the direction of Ameland, dude. I'll kill every fucking Friesians I'll run into. Hey Ries... We Schijndelians help each other, dude. Together, we'll bring your mother back to Brabant, dude. We'll bring her back... ...from that ugly Friesland. Right? I can't. I have to pick up my kid from daycare. I can't come it either. - No, dude, I'll swing by later. Can you hook me up? Is for my dad, you know. Hello? - Hello. Is Richard. Those fucking Friesians slaughtered our mother. Thas bad. - Yes. So me and my buddies want to bring her back to Brabant. What you said about Friesland... About never having to work again... What was that all about? - That offer expired... ...after you took off, of course. We sent in another team: The Red Berets. Listen, Mr Batsbak. We forbid you to enter Friesland. You're ruining our operation. Rikkert! Man, this place is ugly. Goddammit. He's getting back up, thas weird. That guy doesn't look healthy. He looks familiar. I don't know that homo. I saw that in a movie once, dude. Is a vampire. There you go. When you shoot them in the heart, they... Thas the way to do it, dude. Right into his ugly face. Fucking Friesian. Look at this. They didn't get very far. Ries, dude. Fucking snitch. We are back, Biatch! Woensel, get it? Thas Woensel! Woensel! Woensel! Woensel! Catharina Hospital. Everything. You know what I'm saying? Woensel. Get it? Have you found your mom or what? - Not yet, dude. We'll help you, bro. Henk, dude. Can you front me a fries with stew meat? You might be here to help, but you're just going to pay, cunt. Are you retarded or what? Don't use that in someone's ear. Mongoloid. Stop that, dude. Honking attracts those beasts. For Chriss sake. Hey Robbie, how's that possible? That star went into his head, right? You have to hit the brain, dude. Throw harder, cunt. Grizzly! Hey Barrie, do you also have hasj? Just give me for 15 euros and a pre-rolled joint. Keep the change. See you later. Jackass! For Chriss sake. Thas a strange coincidence. It is. I did have enough bullets earlier. - Me too, dude. I was firing away. Just our luck. Hey, fuckers. See you later. Hey Ries, did that flame go inside the hose? My dad, dude. That guy was a great deep-fry cook, for Chriss sake. He made everything super crunchy. Ferry Ameland 34 km OK. No big deal, but I think I'm in love with Deborah. After that one fuck? Do you only like pregnant bitches or what? It happens. Thas just a coincidence. That Manuela was just a filthy whore, but she is a beautiful broad. She's boozing while she's pregnant. She does whatever she wants. I think thas beautiful. I never had a father myself. But I could be there for her kid. I'd raise him as my own. Even if he would be a mongoloid or something. Or premature with water in the brain. Can someone please turn off that fucking song. Goddammit. Fucking Friesians. Sorry. Mom! Boys! Dad. I thought you were dead, dude. Of course not. I wanted to get here early, so I could heat up the oil. Does anyone want something deep-fried? - Some bakpaos? Or not? I'm going to get my mom. - Wait. Ries, dude. What do you think? That she didn't turn into one of those beasts? If you blow her head off, you'll have to drag her headless body back home. Is up to you, dude. No! For Chriss sake. Fucking vampires. Gerrie. What do we have here? Where did you get it? Good quality. Hey, cunt. Mom! Mom! Mom? That fucking horn, man. Hey, Ries. Mom, I love you. Fuck! Fuck! What an idiot. Only Dave and Deborah can save us now. Yes? Later. Adrie's coming to save us. That car is loaded with my fireworks. He's going to light it up and jump out. Right here. Boom. A ball of fire like this. Just wait. Dead. For Chriss sake. Enough already. Ugly fucks... ...the only thing I want is to bury my mom. Get it? We're going to take care of this right now. Race! Rikkert against one of you. They won't understand that, dude. That vampire is pretty much dead. He has nothing to lose, dude. - So what have we got to lose? Nice. I can't see a fucking thing. - Dude, the Manta is ahead. Ford Capri, 2 liters laser... Is fucking fast. Is the mongoloid climbing on the roof? - No. Boring. No cunt, don't shoot the car. Shoot him in the face. Yes! Put them on the train! Hey, Dave. There you are again. How's it going? Nice to see that Maaskantje and Schijndel grew a bit closer together. Right, Dave? Dave. That fuckface. He's been useless. Found this in my inside pocket. AIDS. Good idea to put them on a train. You saved the Netherlands. I didn't know he liked Chinese too. I didn't know he liked Chinese. Chinese. Anyway, I feel honored to inform you that Her Majesty the Queen is pleased... ...to make you a member in the Order of Oranje Nassau. Right, well, one more thing. Two things actually. So here it is: Fuck whores and never work again. Wait. We want to bury my mom first. Let me fuck whores and never work again fuck whores and never work again only fuck whores and never work again fuck whores and never work again only fuck whores... Goddammit, that song hits the spot. Hey. I hit your mom's spot last week. Come on. Let me fuck whores and never work again fuck whores and never work again only fuck whores and never work again Indeed, a parking lot. Yep. Cover the region with asphalt. Fucking Friesland. Hey, Ries. Ries. Goddammit. Sorry. And action. - Hi, I'm Jurgen. I won a part in New Kids Nitro and I'm Jurgen. New Kids Nitro, dude. For Chriss sake thas a strange coincidence. It is. I did have enough bullets earlier. Is the PulpShow! He has a plan. He likes that. Ricardo, muff-diving king, where are you? - He's crazy or not? Hey Ricardo, do you have some bus tickets for... ...for the bus. Floor it. For fuck's sake! Hey, cunt. Are you completely crazy or something? Forgot my lines. Listen, mom. Fuck off to your own cunt town and take that cunt... Hey, I think... The cops! Made by Filipino children. Precision work. Hit the brain, dude. Yo, is me. Do you know where I am? In the theater. You wanna know what I watched? New Kids Nitro, dude. Huh? No, Nitro. Yo, that movie, right? Yes, no, really, dude. Huh? Sure, better than part one. It starts off with the same thing, kind of. With those guys, you know. At some point, they get into a fight with another town over there in... ...you know, Brabant. Yes, Sint Oedelrode. Yes, thas in Brabant. Is all set in Brabant. They get into a fight and go nuts. But it takes too much time, so they build a time machine. Those other guys change into werewolves and they keep walking around. And you won't believe this... I didn't see it coming, anyway... Robots. Yes, real robots. Yes, real fucking robots, dude. Fucking whores. Fucking whores. Sorry. Nice town, Maaskantje, isn't it? - Yes.
