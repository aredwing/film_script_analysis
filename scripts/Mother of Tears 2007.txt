"Oscar de la Vall, 1815." Cut the chains. We'll rebury him on the other side of the cemetery... later tonight. And the urn? Put it in my car. Hang on, Monsignor. Dear Michael... we found something alarming today... right outside of the cemetery. I'm sending this urn over to you... that you can examine its contents. You know more about the history of magic... and esoteric sciences than I do... and I'm hoping you can deny... what I fear. Hey, Sarah. You seen Michael? Not for a couple of hours. - He had to take Paul to the doctor. - Oh, that's right. I was wondering why he wasn't answering his cell. Come take a look at something. What? Here, let me show you. Come with me. All right. - What is it? - Come. I'll show you. I know it's late, but you really need to check this out. - Really? - Yeah. don't keep me hanging. What is it? - All right. It's an urn. - Really? Yes. - Where'd it come from? - Viterbo. A Monsignor Brusca sent it. They found it with a coffin buried in 1815. Mater. - Isn't this amazing? - I've never seen anything like this. I know. Oh. Michael's phone is still off. What do you think? Should we risk opening it without him? - don't ask me. - Yeah, right. You know what? We're just gonna open it up, and I won't touch the letter. - deal. - Okay. - Let's do it. - All right. Do you need help? No, I think I'm okay. Ow! damn it! Are you okay? What is it? Aah. I cut myself. I'll be all right. - It's okay. Are you ready? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's do it. - Let's go. - Like this? Yeah. It's a little tough. All right. Yeah, there you go. Careful. Yeah. Wow. Take a careful look at the hilt. - Tell me what you see. - The gemstone settings. It's a medieval technique, isn't it? Very good. Thirteenth century, most likely. Look. Three statues. - That's kind of scary. - Yeah. - You take it. - There you go. Okay. Oh, there's more. Look at this. Okay. They're so well-preserved. - Yeah. - Look at this writing. - Hey, there's more. - Yeah? This is some kind of talisman. Can you read the writing? No, not offhand. It's some ancient language. You know what? Go and grab the Aramaic and Mycenaean dictionaries, will you? - Yeah. - He'll want us to move on this right away. - Okay. - Thank you. "Seera Leraji"- "Sabnack. " Huh? No! No! Help me! No! Mater. Mater. Go now. Go now! Hello. Help! Please help me! You saw four people, and they were, to use your words, "deformed"? I didn't see their faces, but... there was something very strange about the way they moved. - How so? - It was like- God, they tore her to bits. - The blood, it was- - Wait. - How did they move? - Well, they were sort of hunched over. But I only saw them for a few seconds. - So there were three deformed people. - Yes, and a monkey. - A monkey? - Yes. It was chasing me. Okay. Sarah. So what exactly do you do for the institute, Sarah? I'm studying art restoration and archaeology. Mm-hmm. And did you manage to catalog these pieces of art... that were stolen before they were taken away? No. We were just starting to examine them. Look, I told you everything I know. Can I please go home now, please? - Sarah! - No, it's okay. Let him in. - Michael. Oh, my God. - Sarah! Hey, are you okay? - Michael, it was horrible. And Giselle, she- - Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. I'm here now. It's okay. Hi, I'm Michael Pierce. I'm the director of the museum. I am Enzo Marchi, the head of this investigation. Great. - Look, I'm gonna take her home now, okay? - Of course. No problem. - Thank you. - Are you all right? I can't believe it. did you hear that? She's crazy. You're some detective, you know? - Sure. - Go and keep an eye on her. Can I stay at your place tonight? I really don't feel like being alone. Of course you can. It's freezing outside. - Can I light a fire? - Yeah, sure. I'm just gonna check on Paul. All right. Good. Well, he's still asleep. Something very strange happened to me tonight. And, uh, I feel almost embarrassed to tell you about it. What? Promise me you won't think I'm crazy. - I promise. - All right. I was trapped in there. And there was no way I was gonna get out of there alive. - And then- - What? Nah, never mind. Come on. Tell me. And then... I heard a voice in my head... telling me to go. And then- bam- the doors slammed open! I mean, they were locked and they slammed open! And I-And there was this woman too- Dad? Hey, tiger! What are you doing up? Huh? I thought you were asleep. Ah, come here. - Hi, Paul. - Hi, Sarah. - do you want some hot chocolate? - Yes. Can I stay up late? Yes, you can stay up late. Let's choose one of your books, and we'll take you to bed. Which one are you gonna get? This one? Okay. I'm gonna come in with the hot chocolate now. Come on. Back to bed. Coming in a second, all right? I just can't get my head around it. Why did they have to kill Giselle? What was so important about that urn? Well, from what you told me, they could be talismans. Look, I'm gonna go and see Monsignor Brusca tomorrow morning. Maybe he can shed some more light on it. How do you know him? Well, he came to London a few years ago to lecture on spiritualism. And he's meant to be a leading authority on mysticism and the occult sciences- "Sciences"? Come on. You don't believe in that crap. - The occult? - Yeah. Well, maybe, maybe not. - Hmph. - What? I was just- What, you don't think there are forces out there we don't understand? Not really, no. You and I are scientists. We're supposed to believe in what we see and what we touch. - The chocolate! - See? Forces. I keep hearing that voice echoing in my head. I think I'm going crazy. You're not going crazy. Come here. You're not going crazy. You just- Just need to sleep. Hmm? Just try to sleep, hmm? Chaos. Blood. Tears. Mater! Mater! Certo. Certo. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! - Morning, Father. - Morning. I'm here to see Monsignor Brusca. Oh, you don't know, do you? He had a stroke the day after we found the coffin. He was conscious for only a few minutes before he slipped into a coma. I'm so sorry. Look, I... understand this isn't the best time... but I really do need to know as much as I can about the urn. Look. Look, I really don't know why... anyone would want to take that urn. The only thing I know is that there was a name on the coffin: Oscar de la Vall. - Oscar de la Vall? - Yes. do you know who he was? The monsignor thought it was the same man... who figures in an old story that's been popular in Aosta for centuries. Most people, including me, consider it nothing but legend. Brusca didn't. That's why he sent the items to you for verification. Well, can you tell me about the story? In 1814... workers renovating the church curia in Aosta... discovered an urn. There were several items inside it... including a dress that may have been from pagan times. As the legend has it, packs of wolves came out of the forest... the night after the urn was found. They dug up freshly-buried bodies in the graveyard... and tore them to bits. The local priest decided to send the urn to the Vatican. Oscar de la Vall volunteered to deliver it. He was a knight of noble birth. Only he was allowed to talk with the pope. He had one bad trip. Wherever he went, death and destruction followed. Children died. Crops burned. Whole villages were devastated. Many towns refused to let De la Vall enter. People were in a panic. By the time he reached Viterbo, he was both sick and blind. The church took him in. He died six days later. Maybe it was malarial fever. His body was buried in a secret place. The urn was chained to his coffin and sealed with crucifixes. After the urn was found, the monsignor was a different person. He began talking nonsense. Wait. Wait, wait. I- Yes- - He was writing this when he had the stroke. - Here. It's a list of what was in the urn. - "Mater Lacrimarum. " - Mater Lacrimarum. Yes. The monsignor thought the urn... and its contents were magical... that they belonged to an evil witch... named Mater Lacrimarum- the Mother of Tears. It's such a shame. He was a brilliant man- kind... and a wonderful teacher. To end his days believing in this nonsense- I'm sure he told you the same thing he told me many times- that God's plans for us are a mystery to everyone but him. Monsignor Brusca wrote this for a reason. One we might not understand, but a reason nonetheless. Good-bye, Father. Hold still. I said hold still! - No! Help me! - Open your legs. Open your legs! No! Help me! Stop! Freeze! Freeze! Michael? Hello? Is there anybody home? Michael? Paul? Michael? Michael! What happened? They took him. - Who took him? - The babysitter... went out for two minutes, she said. She came back... and she found... this- "If you want to see your son again... keep the silentium. " The silentium. Michael, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, darling. Those symbols- they are the same ones I saw on the urn. I know! It's the same people. It's some kind of black magic. Black magic? - I don't know about black magic- - What? What, you think this is all some sort of coincidence? - No, I didn't say- - don't be so bloody naive! Giselle's dead. Brusca's in a coma. Now they've taken Paul. It's - It's all connected with the urn and-and those talismans. And they want me to stop looking. They want me to keep quiet. About what? Keep quiet about what? The darkness... gathering around Rome. You haven't seen it? It's happening. Here, come with me! - Look. Let me show you. Look. - I'm coming. What do you think all this is? Where is it? - An epidemic of suicides, 52 in two days! - Yes. Look. A wave of violence spreads through the city- murders, fires, kidnappings, church vandalism- Yes, Michael, you're scaring me. I- I know all this. I'm going to Monteleone. There's a priest there, Father Johannes. And what on earth could he do to help this situation? He's an exorcist- one of the last confirmed by the Vatican. He knows more about the occult than anyone else I know. And he'll be able to help me get Paul back in a way they can't detect. - Look, Michael, why don't we try the police? - No! No police! You saw the way they looked at you at the museum. They thought you were fucking crazy! Michael, look, I-I love Paul, okay, as much as you do... but I don't know if this is the best way- He is my son! Not yours! Michael. Damn it! Be careful, damn it! You rot in hell. - Are you ready for the celebration? - Of course! Excuse me. Three Furies. Furies. Three Fates. Three Graces. Diana, the three-headed- The Triad. Why are they always three? Sorry. Hello? - Sarah, hi. It's me. It's Michael. - Michael? - Where are you? - Wait, no, no. Wait, wait, listen. - I-I really need your help, okay? - Yeah, of course I'll help you. Just tell me what to do. - No, you've got- - Michael? Michael! Hello, are you there? Michael! Help me, Sarah. Help me. Michael, are you still there? Michael? Michael! Whoo-hoo! Hey, sister. Chotomateh! Simone. Ikeh! Okay, please, come on. Let's find her. And try not to draw too much attention to yourselves, okay? - Okay, I know, I know. - Okay, you two with me. Come on. This way. Move! Move! People, we're the police. No, no, no, you can't go in. Can't go in. Lady, you too. Move on, please. Thank you. Move on. - Concentrate. - Huh? Concentrate! They won't see you! Don't worry. They won't see you! We lost her. Okay. What? Excuse me. Where's this train going? - Orte. Leaves in 30 minutes. - Thank you. - Michael? - This is Michael Pierce's voicemail. Please leave a message after the tone. Michael, I've run into problems. I'm going to Monteleone. Bye. Can I help you? Sorry, I don't understand. Get out! The train for Monteleone now leaving on track nine. - Where the fuck is she? - Maybe in there. Maybe she's in there! Well, Sarah Mandy killed this woman because she saw... Miss Mandy attacking da Silva over there. As simple as this. Mandy weighs 110 pounds, at the most? da Silva, God rest his soul, was a fucking gorilla. And he was armed. No, there's more to this case than we think. Can you move them back, please? Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! Nafech! - Yes? - Hello? My name is Sarah Mandy. I'm looking for a friend of mine, Michael Pierce. - He came to see Father Johannes. - No, I'm sorry, he's not here. What? Could I see Father Johannes then? It's very important. You have to come back tomorrow. - He can't see you today. - I'm sorry, but that's not possible. Please, tell him I won't take much of his time. Please. All right. Come in. Thanks. Thanks a lot. You look like you had a hard trip. You have it, you know. Your mother's gaze. You're Elisa Mandy's daughter, aren't you? I'm Marta Colussi. You really look just like her. I knew your mother many years ago in Germany. She was a wonderful teacher. I learned so much from her. She was a great spiritualist- the best I've ever known. - My mother was a dancer. - And a healer. A white witch, if you will. And it seems to me you've inherited some of her gifts. - Listen, lady- - It's Marta. Marta. Whoever you are... I don't know you and I didn't come here to talk to you. Please leave me alone now, okay? How did you get away at the train station? What the-Who are you? Elisa was helping you. Coaching you, wasn't she? I- I don't know. I heard- I heard a voice. - did you really know my mother? - Quite well. - You don't know much about her, do you? - No. I don't remember much about my parents. I was very young when they died in the accident. The car crash in Freiburg. No, honey. I'm sorry. That's not what happened. - Your parents were murdered. - What? What are you talking about? Nobody ever told me this. What are you saying? Your mother dared to fight a very powerful black witch: Mater Suspiriorum, the Mother of Sighs. The Mother of Sighs? Father Johannes. - How many drops? - Twenty, please. You look exhausted. You need to rest. With everything that's going on now? I have to fight. - I have to fight! - Stay calm now. Please. Take your drops. Your weakness is your strength, Father. I've been expecting you. - You're Sarah. - Yes. Hi. There's a lot I have to tell you-about your mother... about you, and about a world- you hardly know. More than a thousand years ago... witchcraft was birthed... by the shores of the Black Sea by three sisters. For years they roamed the earth... bringing death and destruction wherever they went. Search any art history book and you'll find images of them. Eventually, they found homes. Mater Suspiriorum, the Mother of Sighs, settled in Freiburg. The Mother of Pain, Mater Tenebrarum, went to New York. Mater Lacrimarum came to Rome. She's known as the Mother of Tears. She's the most cruel and beautiful of the three. And she's the only one still alive. Mater Tenebrarum and Mater Suspiriorum... died many years ago. The Mother of Sighs. She murdered my parents. Yes. But not before your mother... had injured her horribly. After fighting your mother, she was reduced to a shell of her former self. A young dancer named Suzy Bannion... finally managed to kill her. But that's all history. When that urn Brusca found was opened... it restored the Mother of Tears's powers. How do you know about that? Your friend, Michael, told me about it... when he phoned and spoke of a magic red tunic... that would be a great and powerful talisman. I've had visions. Witches are coming... from all over the world to celebrate her return. Yes. They're arriving in Rome every day. Every jet, every car... every train brings more. They aim to make Rome fall again... to usher in the Second Age of Witches. I can't take it anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy. There's nothing wrong with your mind, Sarah. It's the world that's gone crazy. Have a look. Look at this. Usually I have one exorcism request a month... but the last few days, I've had more cases than I've had in my whole life. Every priest I talk to is faced with the same challenge. Why is all this happening? The Mother of Tears spreads evil wherever she can. Some she kills, others she drives mad. She revels in chaos and human despair. We have work to do. I have a book in my study that shows us the way. Valeria! Valeria! Valeria. Valeria. Requiescat! Father Johannes! - Mother? - Marta, come back! Come back! Mother, I obeyed you! Come on, let's go! Let me- Somebody help- Marta! Marta, help me! Oh, my God! Marta! Marta, let's go! - Where's your car? - It's right there. They're coming! Oh, God, run! It's locked! Open- Open up! - Open it! - I can't find my key! Why were they all after me? Your mother. - What are you doing? - I'm calling Michael. Are you crazy? They can trace you with it. You're right. Fuck it. Come to my place tonight. It'll be safer for you. No, I'd rather go home. Michael can reach me there. Mmm. Here's my phone number and address. - Call me anytime. It's no bother. - Thank you. You're Elisa's daughter. That's closer than family. I don't mean to scare you, but... they know who you are, Sarah. Promise me you won't trust anyone. I promise. What's going on here? They are burning the churches. It's getting worse. Mater! Mater! There was somebody at my apartment! I saw lights and shadows under the door. I feel like I'm going crazy! God! Help. Please help me. Help me, please. Take a deep breath. - Thank you. - Calm down. Come in. - Elga, meet Sarah. - Hi. - What is she doing here? - It's okay. Marta, you have to help me. I don't know what's happening to me. - Come with me. - You have to explain. Why is all this happening to me? Why? They know who you are. They can't take any chances. But I- I- I don't know anything. You know more than you think you do. How else have you survived this long with those monsters after you? Elga, would you please excuse us for a minute? Oh, please. Come on. Please? You have gifts, Sarah. You need to accept that if you want to survive. Watch and learn. drifting spirits. They are everywhere, especially here in Rome. The old houses are full of ghosts. Think about it. The city is 2700 years old... and we are standing on five layers of graves. - How do you do it? - You can do it too. With your gifts, you can see what others can't. Close your eyes. Focus all of your energy... and concentrate on this spot. Good. Now just do like I did and blow. Sarah. No, it can't be. Mommy? Sarah. Ohh. - Mommy! - You can't touch her or she'll disappear. Leave me alone. Mater Lacrimarum grows stronger. She grows stronger, Sarah! Where-Where are you? Mommy! Mommy! You're in great danger, my dear child. - Learn to fight. - No! No! No! Don't go, Mommy! Don't leave me! Mommy, please! Mommy! Please make her come back. Please! Mo- Don't leave me. Don't leave. She told me to fight. You have to help me. I have to fight. Please. I'm only a psychic. I can communicate with spirits, but that's about it. I don't have your mother's gifts, or yours. You need someone who can guide you, point you in the right direction. Yes. Tomorrow I'll introduce you to Guglielmo de Witt. - He's a great Belgian thinker. - Okay. He'll tell you something useful, if it's not too late. Thank you. Oh, thank you. No. No. Pick up the phone. Come on, Marta, pick up the phone! Hello? Hello, Marta? Marta, you have to get out of there now! Marta? Hello? Who's there? Run! It's too late! Now! Run now! No! She doesn't know anything! No! don't do it! don't do it! Mater! Mater! Where is Sarah? She isn't here. Idiot! It is you. It is. Stay strong. Stay strong! - Mom. - Stay strong, Sarah! Yes. Mom, what did they do to you and Dad when- Shh. It's all in the past. There's nothing you can do. It was meant to be. I was so upset, so angry at you for leaving me. Plea- Please don't abandon me again. Forgive me, little Sarah. I can't speak anymore. I belong to another place now. Use your gifts. Use them. Use them. Mommy. Okay, guys, listen up. We're looking for a girl around 28. Her name is Sarah Mandy. If you see her, don't approach her. Michael? Michael. Mi- Michael! Michael! Michael, stop! Michael? Michael. Are you okay? Michael, you're sick. Where's Paul? I thought- did you- I think- I think he's - I think he's dead. - Oh, my God. - They killed him. - Oh, my God. - And I can't - I don't want to talk about that now. Let's go. My apartment is not safe. - Everywhere I go, they- - We'll go to my place. They won't look for you there. No, no. No lights. Why? We don't want them to see us. I'm so happy we found each other. Are you okay? - Why don't you just rest, take off your coat- - No, no, no. I'm freezing. Sorry. I'm freezing. I just haven't spent a- a single night inside. - I looked everywhere for him. - Yeah, what happened? - Because I went to Monteleone to find you. - I couldn't get there. They were following me. Everything you were trying to tell me I understand now. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I'm really sorry. Okay. Maybe you shouldn't smoke. Why don't you- do you want me to fix something? Tea, maybe? No. No, I'm f- I'm fine. I'm just- I'm just pleased I found you again. I'm fine. don't worry. Fine. Michael, you're bleeding! - It's nothing. - Michael, you're hurt! No, it's - it's okay. It's nothing. What do you mean, it's nothing? You're hurt! I told you it's nothing! Get off me! I told you to get the fuck off me! Do you think they would spare me and my child? You're so naive. You can't escape her. But they killed your son! Your mother can't help you anymore. We all have one mother now. The Mother of Tears. You bitch! Oh, you crazy- you crazy bitch! Guglielmo. The name Marta gave you. Find him. Mommy! Sarah! Welcome back to the morning news. And now for today's top story. They're calling it the second fall of Rome. Over the past few days the city has witnessed hundreds of acts of violence. Detective Marchi, you say that they are all connected? Uh, yes... everything started with events at the Art Museum of Rome. The brutal murder of the assistant curator, Giselle Mares. But how does that all tie together? It was the trigger for everything that's happening now. We ask everybody to be on the lookout for this girl, Sarah Mandy... the only witness to events at the museum. - If you see her- - Is she a suspect? If you see her, do not approach her. Call the police and ask to speak to Homicide. Shit! - Fuck you! - Oh, no, fuck you! - Give me my money! - What are you talking about? Give me your car. Give me your car! Sunglasses! No! No! No! Hello? Yes, can I please have the address for Mr. Guglielmo De-Witt? D, e, w, i, double t. - Yes? - I need to see Guglielmo De-Witt. And you are? My name won't mean anything to him. All right. Come in. So, you wanted to see me? Please sit down. As you can see, I- I'm not very mobile. I'm here because I- I have to ask you about- We alchemists may practice an ancient art... but we do watch the news. do you think I wouldn't know who you are, Sarah Mandy? And that the police is looking for you because you're wanted for murder? Another thing about us alchemists- we're not all one thing or another. After all, good magic is good, and black magic is- Well, it's good too. Some of what we do is magic, science... esoterism, theosophy, natural law. A little of this and a little of that. This will let me know who you really are... and what you've really seen. Hmm. Interesting. I see you have latent powers. Instinct more than anything else. Marta Colussi sent you, I see. So did your mother, Elisa Mandy. What did you do to me? Huh? did you expect me to just let you waltz in here without making sure who you are? Now, why exactly did you come here? I need to find the Mother of Tears. - Why? - Look what's happening to the city. Rome is falling apart. She has to be stopped. Mmm. What do you think you can do? Kill her? Well, my mother was very powerful... and I think I might have the same gifts. Which you found out about when? Yesterday? I don't know. There's got to be some people that can help, people like my mother. Father Johannes said that- that Mater Lacrimarum is bringing on the Second Age of Witches. Mmm. Father Johannes was right. Somewhere in the city the celebration has already begun. But I'm afraid there is no army of good witches out there to come to the rescue. If you want to stop her, you have to do it yourself. So I'm on my own now? I didn't say I wouldn't help. I can't give you answers, but I can share information. Follow me. Centuries ago, a great Roman alchemist named Varelli... lived for a time in this villa. He was also a gifted architect. And near the end of his life, he built the residences for the Three Mothers. This may tell you something you need to know. The Three Mothers. I don't know how much it will cost me... to break what we alchemists have always called SILENTIUM. I met the three Mothers... and built three houses for them: one in Freiburg, one in New York... and one in Rome. I discovered too late that these houses hide obscene secrets. It is from here that the sisters spread pain... tears and darkness throughout the world. This building should be the one Varelli built in Rome. "What you see... "does not exist... and what you cannot see is truth. " It's a riddle. Find where Mater Lacrimarum resides... and you'll find the answer. Are you sure you want to do this? do I have a choice? Mater. Mater. Mater. Mater. Stop. Stop right here! Hey! Who are you? I, uh- I just saw some women come in. - did you see them? - No. - You here to interview me? - Yeah. Here. How long you've been living here? Shh-A long time. Thirty, forty years. Since the Nazis escaped at the end of the war. And who used to live here before you? Oh, I don't know. A kind of association. Philosophers. Artists maybe. I don't remember. Why did they leave? Maybe because when the Nazis occupied the villa... they tortured and killed a lot of people down here. Hey! You won't report me, will ya? Shh, shh. Easy. - Where did she go? - I think she's gone. I'll check upstairs. - Stay here. - Yeah. - She's not there! - Then she's gone. Everything's okay. You forgot what we were supposed to do, didn't you? - No. - No? Inform them every time somebody comes to look around! - Understand? - Yes! - Yes. - Move! - Where did they go? They just- - Shh. They're in here. I can feel it. "What you see does not exist... and what you cannot see is truth. " The secret of the house. Those are the same symbols I saw on the urn. Catacombs. These are unexplored catacombs. Oh, my God. This is the home of the Mother of Tears... and her followers. Dear God. Witches. Witches? What are you talking about? You'll see. Stay behind me. The three Graces. What are you doing down here? I'm an art historian. I just wanted to see- Come with us. I'll let you see something. We'll show you! Yeah! We'll show you! Come on! Mother, give us power! Burn it all! I will! I will! I will! Stop please! No! No! Mater! Mater! - Mater! - Mater! Look, Mother! An intruder! Wait! Get him! We'll eat you alive! Hang him! Our hour... is coming! Hello, Sarah. Come here. Who wants to eat the girl? Me. We have waited for this moment... for one thousand years! Our power is here! No one can stop us now! No one! No! - Damn you! - It's an earthquake! No! No! No! Sarah! Shh! Shh! It's me, it's me! It's me! It's me! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Enzo. Enzo! Go. Go! Go! Mother. Mother. Mater Lacrimarum Mater Lacrimarum Hail to the queen of rare delights Malefic and tragic are the strings of her magic Screaming through the night She is sex and death and more The scent of evil in the glittering city A virgin and a whore For the horns of blasphemy Mater She's our Mother of Tears Lacrimarum The howling on the wind Mater She's the lover of all our fears Lacrimarum Mater Lacrimarum Mater Hail to the goddess of the storm Dancing on the abyss in a blaze of light A darkened star reborn When the moon hangs in the sky Sabbatical and fatter than the blood red sunset Know the reason why The heavens burned today Mater She's our Mother of Tears Lacrimarum Mater She's our Mother of Tears Lacrimarum Mater She's our Mother of Tears Lacrimarum The howling on the wind Mater She's our Mother of Tears Lacrimarum The more in mortal sin Mater She's our Mother of Tears Lacrimarum Chaos in the cosmos Mater She's the lover of all our fears Lacrimarum Mater Lacrimarum Mother
