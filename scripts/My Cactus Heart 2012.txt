Sandy did a great job! Yeah, right! - Miss, thank you! - So, did they like the demo reel? A bit... A bit? What do you mean? They only like it a bit? Or they don't like it one bit? Pork blood stew. Do you want this? It's tinumis.  I don't like that. Really? Are you afraid of blood? You know... Excuse me. Your story is really good. The only problem is the ending. It's too sad. What kind of a love story has a sad ending? It has a happy ending! it's good enough. What? You call that a happy ending? The boy and the girl got separated. The boy disappeared! By popular definition, that is not a happy ending. Well, at least, not in my planet. So anyway, I told the investors it's just a demo. So if they want anything changed, then we will revise it. Revise? What do you mean? The story can't be changed! Sandy, we're just going to make the ending lighter. Make it a little more commercial. We'll put a hug, a kiss, a little affection... Some tears and quotable quotes! You know, love is a fairy tale. Love is cheesy. Love is sweet... - Love is... LOVE! - Hi, Ma'am! Hi! Get it'? Sandy, this is the big break our studio's been waiting for. What's the deal? Don't you believe in happy endings? - What "happy endings"? - Happy ending... As in boy and girl... together... forever. Sandy, I just want to know if we have the same idea about "happily ever after". Okay, fine. A simpler question... Have you ever been in love'? What kind of question is that? It's too personal. Excuse me, Miss Macalintal. It only becomes personal if you upload your video on YouTube. I'm your boss. But other than being your boss, I'm also your friend. So, you can tell me. So, you can tell me. I'm not leaving until you spill! Ouch! That's karma! Okay! All right! Short or long answer? Short or long. Team Edward or Team Jacob. Try me. Anything. I will listen. Before we go to the ending... We should start at the beginning, right? Yes. Let's start with my family. This is my mother. She loves cooking. That's why she has a catering business. My dad thinks he's the singing salesman, but he's always off-key. My older sister, Helena, has always been serious as a child. Thank you. papa-' My brother Kale loves the camera. Sandy, look at the camera! Don't, brother Kale! And there's me. I thought we were a happy family... But what I thought wasn't always the case. Sandy... - Papa? - Come here. Isn't your first communion rites over? But I like wearing this... Because I look like a princess. You always look like a princess to daddy. Sandy... Always remember... What is it, daddy? If papa leaves... He'll come back for you. Promise? Promise. I love you, Papa- I will never forget that day. I love you, Sandy! Lindsay, the bloodied pork? Coming soon! Papa, when will you be promoted... - as Vice-President for Sales'? - So you won't always be out of town. Actually, kids, I'm already the Vice-President for Sales! - Wow, papa's already the Vice-President! - Is this true? Let me kiss you! Papa... Papa, I want new shoes! I want new shoes, too! - Papa, buy me some toys! - Of course! And shoes... And headbands... I might be away for a long time... That's the first time I've heard that. I'm sorry, mama. Weren't you the one who always said... That in this family... Honesty is the... The cover... Do you want to add some more sugar? Lindsay, where's the pork blood stew?! Mama... Helena... Kale... Sandy... Papa will be living in Cebu for a while. I just want to be alone. While you're alone, you might want us to keep you company... Mama, papa said he wants to be alone. Danny, are you leaving us? Margaret, I'll always be here for family weekend dinners. Come on... Don't frown. Your empanada is really good. Come, taste it. - Here. Come on, Mama. - Here's the pork blood stew! I knew it. I knew it all along. You're leaving us, right? Ma'am, I already told you... Tomorrow is my day-off, right? Take this pork blood stew that's as black as your heart! Mama! Mama, no! Mama... Papa! Sweetened soy pudding! One ice cream, please! Daddy! I've been waiting for you! Really? Are you ready to leave? Yes! Let's go! One two three four five six seven eight... Don't too close. I know you love me. Stop it. Joanna! Wait... I'll wait for you outside. Sandy, come with me tomorrow, okay? The Ring is already showing in cinemas. I can't. Papa's coming home tomorrow. He told us he has a surprise. He's going to tell us something. I think he's coming back for good! You've been hoping for that for so long but nothing ever happens. What if I get so scared'? I have no one to hold on to. Do you want me to hold on to Ricky? He's so hot, isn't he? He looks like Ricky Martin! Ricky! How did you meet your Ricky? I wrote a love letter to my soul mate. I wrote: "Whoever you are, give me a sign. " After that, I threw it. Your soul mate got it fast! Where did you throw it'? In the men's CR... Because... It would be easier for him to get it. What?! That's love, you know'? Love is an adventure! Right? I'll be with you in a bit. What? Go with me tomorrow to the shop? The iPod is already available in the Philippines. Okay! Don't frown. So, this is it? Your letter to your soul mate? Why didn't you throw it to the Universe? I did... No... But no one got it'? Someone did! So, why is it still here? - Yeah! - Just listen to me, will you? You're not letting me finish! - Sensitive! - Okay. So, this is what happened... I accompanied my best friend, Joanna... Then... That's where you met your soul mate, right? No. I met him earlier... Are you ready? Yes! Come on. Hey, aren't you going to apologize? You spilled ice cream on me, and you want me to apologize to you'? I was still going wear this tomorrow! Look at this! I have so much ice cream on my hand! That's it? Why don't you just lick it off? It will be a waste. Gross! You don't want it? Eww! Ewvwv! Eww! There. Better? Yuck! That's when I met Carlo. Who's Carlo? Carlo, don't forget to eat this. Thank you! There you go. Carlo, what's that'? Dad, isn't it All Soul's Day today? I lit a candle for mom's soul. You, weird kid! You're turning our house into a cemetery! Then let's go to Singapore! That's where we'll light candles for her! Singapore is far from here. It's not as near as Quiapo. Son... Just think that she's still alive. Even if she's dead? Then she's a ghost! You... If you don't stop, I'll turn you into a ghost! Come upstairs! Dad! Why does he look like a waiter? Your son came from his confirmation rites... But you deemed your racehorses more important! What are you talking about? You know that I can't go to the church. I'm mad at the Lord. You're the one who's mad?! Isn't he the Lord? He can't get mad at me! Sheesh! What's that? Does it look like a piano? It's my gift for him. Why? How many times do I have to tell you... that I don't want to see a guitar in this house! - I bought this myself! - I don't care if you bought this! I don't want him to remember Adora! Move on! - Don't! - Come here. That! I deleted my Twitter profile last night... I had too many followers, but no one to be with. - I saw you sitting by the window... - That one! You looked dazed... Without earplugs in your ear. You have a blog... But it's on paper. You play Farmville At the backyard of your house. You said you'll get cancer with your gadgets... So that's why you burned the Xbox of your ex-girlfriend. You're the one I like, baby. I won't recommend you to someone else. Thank you very much! Bye! Don't ignore me, please. You're the one I like, baby. You're the winner till the end. Everything I see in you, I already like. Can I be your friend? Tricycle! - Tricycle! - Can I be your friend? Can I be your friend? Joanna! Hey! Wait for me! Then why didn't you know he was your soul mate? Because I didn't look back... Oh... because "love is timing.  Mama! Papa's here! Kale, point the camera at papa! Hi, girls! Kale! I missed you! I have something for you! This is my friend, Lucy. I met her at an Asia-Pacific flight. She's a stewardess. Sandy... This is what you asked, right? A book of poems by Neruda. Thank you, papa! I had a hard time looking for that book. I finally found it in Hong Kong! I was surprised. You actually like poems? Why? Is there something wrong with poetry? Silly poems. Silly? Are you calling our little artist silly?! What do you read? Tabloids? Porn? Stop this! You have some nerve... Bringing this demon, Lucy-fer, in my house! Margaret, haven't we talked about this? Open relationship? Do you want me to open your skull with this! Ma... It's just salad. Ma. It's nothing. Here's the pork blood stew! No! Papa! Papa... You're leaving? Papa, you're never coming back'? I come home often, don't I? Almost every month. Papa... It's not the same. Your mom told you about the annulment, right? You don't love us anymore... Sandy... You're still my princess. How about my mom'? You don't love her anymore? Sandy, I hope you understand. Your mother and I... We're only human. We make mistakes. Mistakes? Sometimes... Love can be a mistake. Dan... Sandy, I'm sorry. Dan, give me a chance... Let's talk about it another time. Dan... Dan, we're just here... Dan... That's when I realized... That everything I used to know about love... Was a lie! Hey, Sandy! Let's go to N'Sync's concert in Manila. Lance is such a heartthrob! Why are you ripping your colored drawings? You're left with the black and white ones. Because life is simple... Black and white. In love... If you give your heart away... it will be torn into pieces. You'll be abandoned. You'll be left hanging. Until you end up... soaking wet in the rain! That's why before they leave me... I'll be the first one to say, "Goodbye!" So, since then, it became your hobby to break hearts. Hong Kong? Edmond, we can't be together! Really? Kalibo's so far away. Let's just send messages to each other. Rehabilitation will take too long. I don't want to be a nun. Just forget me. We have grown apart. It's not you, Sam. It's me. I don't want to be with someone who'll leave me. I hope you understand. Why are you like that? You've hurt all those guys! Karma will get back at you. If you did that now, you'd be trending on Twitter. Philippines or worldwide? Don't over-react! Your imaginations are exaggerated! Not really. I think you're too choosy. Or you've become choosy because you're afraid to be cheesy. But you're not even that pretty. - Wow! And you're gorgeous? I'm sorry... - Excuse me... For your information, that face attracts Fil-Italians. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? - Let's go, let's go. - Is this Showtime? Back to work, you, nosy people! But, to be fair... I think they're right. I'm sure you've become known as a Blip-tease. Blip-tease'? Blip-tease. I don't want to say "cock. " I- Hmm? That's what Joanna told me as well. Aren't you jealous of your siblings who have happy relationships? What?! I also want love... - But... - But what? Instead of getting heartbroken, you'd rather be the heartbreaker? Right? Correct! I'm telling you, one day, all men will disappear. I tell you! Disappear? It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter if you're gone. - Because I still love you more than my life - I'm sorry. Take two! Dude, you're putting the lyrics on the wrong take. Rewind it. Kale... Not having a father figure really affected him... but he turned all right. Helena and her boyfriend Val seem to be perfect for each other. And when I see them, yes, I feel a tinge of jealousy. But when I see my mom... who got attached with John Lloyd Cruz... I'm reminded... I don't want to be like her. Hurry up! Put that in the pressure cooker. That's our dinner later. Ma'am, this is Carlo. Our new waiter. Handsome, right? You're accepted. Thank you very much, Mrs. Macalintal! Ma'am, look at him. Fred's uniform suits him! Shush! It's a good thing it didn't go to waste even if Fred's dead. You're accepted. We really need waiters just like you. Because you're presentable. Not like Tommy here. - You're handsome. - Of course. But you know, I have a rule to be followed. What's that? A hardworking waiter does is useless if their underarms smell like garbage! Raise your hands and shout, Darna! Do it. Darna! Darna! Okay Hi Ma'am. Because I'm falling in love... 'Coz I'm falling in love... Because I'm falling in love... 'COz I'm falling in love... with you. Dude, let's have our snacks. Or... are you snacking on something else already? Stop it, dude! I'm not like that! Is it a crime to look? It's not that... But that girl is notorious. They call her Miss Cactus Heart. Do you know why? She's a plant lover? No. Because you'll only get hurt if you get near her. You know, every man that approached her walked away heartbroken. Then... I won't pursue. I change my mind... But man... Just look at her. She's beautiful. She's different from everyone else. Of course. Look at her. You could just kiss her lips... And her body... whoa! Uh, dude. I'm not that kind of guy. Admit it. Waiter. Yes ma'am? Why did you call me'? Not you. I was talking to my friend. But you called me, ma'am. Anyway, going back. Sandy, all I'm saying is... The reason you don't like him is because he's only a waiter. Just like the other -ERs. Wait-ER. Drive-ER. Carpent-ER. But he's not just a waiter. After catering, he has gigs with his band. Band memb-ER. Hey, his band was famous! Soon... Coming soon. They're about to get famous. Okay, let's do this. Come on. One two three four and go! What are they doing? Yuck! Perfect! Perfect! Did you hear that? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am! Perfectly wrong! I could to better than you! Your bodies are too stiff. Don't forget, our luau party's tomorrow! Kale, bring those inside. Okay. - You perfect that or I'll replace you! - Go! Okay. One more rehearsal. One - two - three... Okay. Let's just take a break. Break, guys! Ma'am Sandy, hello. I heard Sir Kale said that you like writing poems. I have some lyrics here... Can you check them for me? Are these love songs? I don't like love songs. I don't believe in what they say. Oh! Don't say that, Ma'am! They might not believe in you too. Ma'am, if you ask me... if there are no love songs, I wouldn't be able to live. My heart would die. Corny. Let me take those. Ma'am I'm really corny and I'm proud of it! You know, sometimes, it's fun to be corny when it comes to love. Oh, I think I've figured it out. You've never been in love... Right? Ma'am, aren't you looking for that one person... who would make your heart come alive? You know what? Don't pretend you know me. I haven't found anyone because I'm not looking! Oh, that's alright. Don't worry. Even if you don't look for him, I know he'll be able to find you. You know what, Ma'am Sandy, I call out everyday... Soul mate. Please find me... And I know that one day- Wait a minute. Soul mate? Please find me'? Yes. Exactly. And I know one day... my soul mate will find me. Carlo come on. Let's rehearse! Oh, I better go. Ma'am, can you hold these please? Thank you. Okay, ready boys! What's that? I just got this from... Our waitress. I thought you only had waiters in your business? Anyway, Kale told me... that he was going to introduce you to someone for a date. Wait a minute. Do you remember what you taught me before? When we were in high school? You'll write to your soul mate... you'll throw it to the Universe... then it will come back to you? And whoever gives it back is your soul mate? You still believe in that? Of course not. I believe in soul mates. Because soul mates are like fishballs. How come'? Because with fishballs, you have to pierce them in to get them. Right? Exactly! Let's cheers! Cheers! Let's cheers for that. By the way, I've been asking Kale about you for a long time. But he didn't want to give me your number. Did you have a boyfriend then? - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. - I didn't have a boyfriend. - Welcome to our second set tonight! - I find that hard to believe. With a beautiful face like yours... And during our second set, we entertain song requests! Wait a minute... - And our first request for the night... - I have to go to the bathroom. - Is from Kara Abellera. - Guys... I'll just go to the CR, alright? "Kaba?" Do you guys know "Kaba?" We'll figure it out. We can do this. Okay! One, two, three... go! Don't know what I'm feeling Every time I see you It's a strong feeling and it tenses me up inside. Every day I wonder Why my heart is like this Every move I make changes when you're near me Can't sleep at night just thinking How you could notice me? Would you realize what I'm feeling inside? What should my heart say to the one it likes? Every day I wonder Why my heart is like this Every move I make changes when you're near me Thank you! You were able to come to my gig. How did you know my band played here? Carlo... Don't flatter yourself. I didn't come here for you. My friends invited me out so I came with them. Oh, I see. Alright, I'll just go ahead. Your date might be looking for you already. Oh no. I already left him inside. Why? What happened? Because his huge hands were feeling me up! Hey, that's not allowed! Who's that guy? He can't do that to my Ma'am Sandy! Where is he? Oh, it's alright. You'll just lose. What do you mean I'll lose? Even if he's the king of Kung Fu, or the son of a senator, I don't care. Where is he?! - You really want to? - Yes! Okay, fine. There! - Oh no! Okay, stand up. Here. - Come here! Wait a minute, I thought... Ouch! Don't stand up anymore! it's embarrassing! You're embarrassing. Come on. Ouch! Oh no! Are your ribs broken? - Where does it hurl? - There! Where? Your tummy? Where? There! Where? There... on my tummy. Here. - Hey! - Are you trying to fool me'? I don't think you're hurl. Well it doesn't hurt anymore because you touched it already. WOW! Aren't you cheesy? Cheesy? But it's effective. I made you laugh. I think it might be too effective. Why are you still laughing at me? You were so funny earlier! No matter how many times Romeo punched you, it didn't matter to you! You were like a spring. You kept coming back! I did that for you, Ma'am Sandy? Can we make a deal? Yeah? Don't call me "Ma'am" Sandy. Because you're not like Robin Padilla. Okay, where should I take you'? Let's go'? Oh no, please. Isn't it more appropriate that the wooer would bring you home? Huh? Are you trying to date me? No. If I was trying to, then I'd ask you out. Well, if you were trying to date me and you asked me... I only have one answer - NO. NO? No. No as in no? No as in no. Okay. - Alright, I'll go ahead. - No wait. Just wait! If I were Robin, I'd have stolen a kiss from Sharon now. And if I were Sharon, I'd have slapped Robin already. But if I were Robin, I wouldn't mind. Cause I got to kiss you... Oh, poor cat! - Come on, let's eat! - Let's help them out. Auntie Au! Oh Carlo! I'm sorry I wasn't able to go to your first gig. I closed the cashier earlier. Auntie, this is Sandy. Mrs. Macalintal's daughter. Sandy, this is my auntie Au-Au. She brought me up when I was younger. Oh, hello Auntie Au-Au. Just call me Au "Au-Au" sound like a dog. I might just bite you. Come Sandy, let's celebrate. - For the festival? - No! Because of the miracle! You got home safe despite the way you drive! Let's go! Come on. I won again! Hey, where are you going? - You're such a sore loser. - Okay, drink up! Hey! You won't take a hint? Just when I'm winning, you ruin my streak! Even if you're not winning, you still gamble! Fine, drink your lives away! Who are they? That's my mom. She was a singer in Singapore. And your dad? He was the keyboardist. Ohhh... But then, my mom died when she gave birth to me in Singapore. My dad brought me back here. Since then, music was banned in the house. But even if my dad is like that, I understand him. Because if you lost the one you love... all the music in the world loses meaning as well. Aren't you amazed at how much my dad loved my mom? That's why I'm like my dad. I rarely fall in love but when I do... It'll be forever. Carlo! Hey auntie! I can't find what you were hiding from Sandy earlier. Auntie! You ruined my surprise! Sandy, stay here. I'll just get something. Don't be too hard on Carlo. This is the first time he's made a move on a girl. Auntie, he's not making the moves on me. Don't be naive. Actually, his moves are stale. A lot of girls have a crush on him... but he doesn't care. I used to think he just didn't know how to approach a girl. Oh I'm sure he's a heart throb. And he's so disciplined. Always working, day and night. Oh he just needs to. If not, our house will be repossessed. And that's the only thing his mom left them. That's why he saves each peso he gets. Hey Sandy! Okay, I'll go ahead! I have a hot date waiting for me on the webcam! Wow. I noticed your pencils were getting worn out. Yeah. Here. I asked for some cash advance at work so I can buy you some colored pencils. That's sweet! This is what I used when I was in grade school... Oh... is that for kids? Yeah. Alright, I'll just bring it back. - No, it's alright. No, give it back. Just - Oh! - Sandy, it's alright. I'll just return it. Sandy. I told you to give it. It's fine. Oh, I also have a surprise for you. Don't think you're the only one... - What's that? - Here. Whoa! I just did some revisions. Sandy... You know, this is the first time someone did this for me. Thank you! - Uh - I need to... - Huh? I need to go home. Wait a minute... Sandy, can we go out some ti- No. Don't finish your sentence. I know exactly what you're gonna go. Carlo, can't you see? I'm a confused person! I don't even know which course I want! And my heart is like a cactus. It's prickly... And hurtful... To people. But what if I want to get hurt? Huh? Great timing. Uh, just ask me tomorrow. Okay. Okay. Sandy, the driver's seat is on the other side. I know. I was just checking if I hit the cat earlier. Sandy, are you okay? I can't describe When I first met you You're moving so slow! The wind whispered to me Telling me you're the one My today, my tomorrow And my forever with no end My heart will never change I hope the heavens hear My one special wish I never thought That you'd ever be mine Until the sun bums - I'll only shout your name! - Here, Miss Lorna Tolentino. - Tommy! - My heart will never change Forever I am at your service The light to your night - The star you wish upon - Ma'am Sandy! The heaven Is my witness It will never change It will never change My heart will never change. It seems it's not enough - Good morning, how are you? - Like the soul of the stars You come from the heavens You fell into my life Even if the rain pours My feelings remain - My heart will never change - Sir. Water? As long as I live I am at your service The light to your night The star you wish upon... as the heavens Are my witness We'll be early tomorrow. Sandy, you're in charge of the grill station. Make sure that everything is prepared here tomorrow. Joseph, I want you to be in charge of the cold section. Yes, chef! You're in charge of the dessert station. Yes chef. Where are you going'? - Miss Macalintal, it's your turn to tidy up. - Yes? Kale, tell your sister off. - Yes sir. Miss Macalintal, you clean up. - Okay, class dismissed. You better help me with this. It's already dismissal! Sandy, it's so obvious that culinary arts is not your passion! Okay, I'm coming clean. I admit it, alright? I'll start going to all the job interviews at the animation studios, okay'? - Sandy, we'll go ahead. - Okay, take care! That's awesome! Bye! You know Sandy, you're in the right track. Do what makes you happy. Follow your bliss! Wait a minute, why are you suddenly inviting for a movie? Don't you have a shoot today? VTRs, weddings, karaoke... funerals? None. I'm a free bird today. Well why don't you invite your editor for a date. What's his name again? Honey, he's over! - Over? - Yes. That's it? Of course. Why would you prolong something that isn't there? It's unfair. Wait a minute, don't change the subject. How about you and Carlo'? Confirmed? Denied. Really? The waiters have been talking about you. They know that you've been helping Carlo with his lyrics. And Carlo's cellphone load is being used up calling and texting you everyday! We're just friends. Oh don't try to fool me with your just friends answer. That's not even accepted on Twitter now! Sandy, just admit it. There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. I don't like him. And if I did, we'd never get together anyway. Alright? No... as in no. Well, it might be "no" for you. But what about Carlo'? There you go again. You know, if you keep watering your cactus heart... its thorns get sharper and sharper. Sandy, if you don't like Carlo. Then tell him. So we won't be expecting anything. And he won't get hurt. You know it's the right thing to do. Come on, John Lloyd is already waiting for us! Sandy, let's go to the movies! Miss Macalintal? Miss? Miss Macalintal? Miss Macalintal? I'm afraid Sir Benedict is stuck at a meeting. But you can leave your portfolio with us... and we'll inform you when he can interview you. Let me take that. Oh, alright. Thank you! Carlo: Ma'am Sandy, I hope you can come later. I'll wait for you. Sorry Carlo, I'm busy today. Maybe next time. So... you avoided him? Well, I got scared. And it was perfect timing. Benedict arrived, carrying a Frappuccino. And I wasn't looking. I get it. it's just like a romcom, right? He arrived. You weren't looking. You bumped into each other. The Frappuccino spilled on your face! Just like the bloodied pork! See? It's destiny. Fate! Miss, I'm sorry. It's alright. I'm used to it. Excuse me. That's what happened, right? No. This is what happened... I'm sorry. I almost spilled my chocolate on you. That's alright. I'm used to it. Excuse me. So what part did Bene play in your life? Oh! - Mr. Gotiaco, Sandy. My sister. - Yes! Benedict Mr. Gotiaco, yes, Sir Benedict. I applied at your office! Yes, Miss Macalintal. But you haven't been replying to my emails. So I decided to come here personally. Mr. Gotiaco, let's not discuss anything here. Come, join us for lunch! Oh yes. Let's discuss it over lunch. Come, sit here. Thank you. A formal setting? Is there a special occasion? We have a formal catering event tomorrow. The waiters are practicing for the event. Sorry, man. I was just practicing. So... Benedict, right? Yes sir. Impressive. Animation... Well, actually, the Philippines have been in a subcontract... with American and European animation. But we don't have a Filipino original style... that's not influenced by the Japanese or Disney. When I looked at Sandy's art, it was a combination. Your daughter is very talented. And I'm very happy she applied at our company. You're taking animation? Well, that's what I really want. Your daughter is really good! Oh. May I? There. Ouch! Oh! It hurts... But if it's for Sandy... Just a little trick I learned from college. Hey dude, he's really handsome. Like he came from a Korea novella. You can't beat that, ma- My parents hoped I would warm up to their hardware business. But it didn't happen. I even trained in Gibley. But when I was in Japan... I discovered that there was a lot of opportunities there and I figured that... Oh! Sorry, sorry! But... this is my name. Does this mean that I'm accepted? Yes Sandy. You're hired! It's the obvious choice. With your talent and... You're so beautiful... I mean... Has anyone ever told you that you're special? The last person who told me I'm special... Left me in the end. Well... I won't ever leave you. Huh? By the way, Sandy, welcome to the company! Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am Sandy! Why aren't you replying to my messages? Oh, I don't have load... Um Carlo, I - I was charging my cellphone. It's been dead for two weeks already... Two weeks? Ma'am, ma'am... but... Carlo, can't this wait'? I still have some things to attend to. The deadline for my requirements is nearing. Okay? You know, I never thought my foolishness would go that far. I was so stupid! When deep inside, I knew that this only contained Carlo. But what did I do'? Miss Macalintal, you are not choosy. - Okay, okay... - And you are also not a tease. So what am I? Scared! You're afraid. You don't want to lay your happiness in the hands of one person. You're afraid that in the end, he'll just leave you too. That's why you keep looking for reasons not to fall in love with Carlo. NBI, SSS, almost all your employment requirements are complete. I want to accompany you because I enjoy your company. Oh, do you want some ice cream? Okay. Even at home, I'm the one who does magic for my family. But when I'm with you, it feels like you create the magic for us. Oh there you go again. But you do know that magic is not real, right? How so? Look, it's because - thank you. It doesn't work when it matters. I used to write to my future soul mate... and I left the letter inside a guitar. I was told that it will come back to me. I just had to wait. But do you know how many years I've been waiting'? One year... two years... three years... four years. How many years! But it still hasn't returned. That's why magic isn't real. Well, maybe he's just taking time to come. You never know. I might be the one to find it. I might be your soul mate. Oh, that was long ago. Oh, my brother texted. He says it's urgent. He needs my help! Here. A little more to the left. Where are our extras? Brother. Thank God, Sandy, you're here! It's so frustrating! I'm already delayed. And the concept for the videoke is unique! On the wall, in the air. Our extras don't want to be suspended in the air. So... you can do this, right? Me'? Come on. You'll just be the body-double. No close up! - Oh alright. - So... where's your partner? Does Sandy need a partner? I could volunteer. What's this for? Sir Kale, Sir Kale! You texted? You said it's urgent. Yes Carlo. I heard it's your day-off from catering. Did I bother you? Oh no, it's no bother. What is it? Well, I was going to make you Sandy's partner for the videoke. Okay! But... Sir Benedict has already volunteered. Of course. I'll do anything for my new girl, right? So... you can go back to what you were doing. Sorry, Carlo. Girl employee. - Okay. - Thank you. So... Direk Kale, what are we supposed to do? - Firstly, you need to climb that. - Huh'? Wall climbing... then rappelling... and then, zip line! And finally, there's a roller coaster ride. Isn't it exciting? Sir Benedict? Why do you suddenly look like a zombie? Oh, umm... anything except this. Oh, let me! Let me... Let me be Sandy's partner. Perfect! Okay, put the straps on the two. Sandy, Carlo, you can change inside. We had some costumes prepared for you. We'll be taking the scenes in a few minutes, okay? Let's go! Alright guys. Get ready with the first set-up. Come on, climb higher! More! Oh no. Are you afraid of heights? A bit. A bit?! Yeah, the type that makes me pee but not poop. That makes you pee. Well why did you still volunteer? Because... I want to be with you. Carlo, hold on! Cut! Sandy, Carlo, the camera's over here okay'? Ready? Three, two, one, go! Go! Go! Look at the camera! You're afraid of roller coasters too? Why are you riding? I don't mind. I get to sit beside you. Here she comes. I gotta hide my guitar right now. Because I couldn't take it if she passes by And she sees me. I'm sure, dude... I'll start melting... When she's here... - My whole world stops - One, two, three... I can't help myself when I see her I'm telling you, man... I am hit! Cut! Okay, next set-up, Ziplinel Action! Oh why is it when she's there, I become stiff? Oh why is it when she's there, I get confused? I just hope she'd get to know what my heart feels... Okay Sandy, Carlo, let go! Good take, Carlo. Sandy, watch your step. Oh, I left my cellphone. Can you get it? - Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll get it. Wait. - Mommy might be calling. Finally, you found someone you like from your suitors. You're ready to get hurl. Okay. Good job, guys! It's a wrap! Sandy, here's your phone. Do you want something to eat? Lasagna? Pizza'? Burger? - I'm good. - Burger! It's alright. Is there a problem? None. So... when are we. When are we what? Having our date? Sorry. I'm still busy with everything I'm doing. Busy. Busy with that Chinese sauce. What Chinese sauce? Chinese socialite. Chinese sauce. You know what, you're lucky. Your dreams are coming true. Your life has direction. Your family really likes that guy. Not like me. What are you trying to say'? Everything that you can't tell me to my face. I can't have dinner with your family because I'm just a singing waiter. You're so dramatic! - You know that's not true! - No, it's really true. - What do you want to tell me'? - Are you high'? - Are you telling me I'm elitist? - Cause I can't reach you. - I'm not saying you're elitist. - What are you sayi- I'm just saying that you don't want to date me. - Just a date? Then let's date! - Date? ' Yes! Yes? - Date! - Yes as in yes? Yes as in yes! - Why are you finishing the ketchup? - I'm not eating it all up. If you want some, then get some! No take-backs! We have a date! Hey! Yes. YES! YES! YES! We have a date! Hey! Yes! Yes! Yes! Sixty days notice? It might be better if we sell this house than have it repossessed. We can move to a room for rent. Auntie, no! This is mom and dad's house! Well, I'll just get a room with a big wall and hang all your mother's pictures there. It won't make a difference! Auntie, don't be like that. I'll knock at each neighbor's door. They might have some broken fans or components that I can repair. Thank you, dad. Hello, Arianna? You will be the first to hear the news. So... our run is over? Well yes. Your run is over. Because I have a booking cooked up for you. Kuala Lumpur... and then Singapore. And Aussie bars. They're Australians... and take note expatriates. Auntie, auntie, dad! It's our dream come true! I have a job at Singapore. We can pay off our debts! Carlo, relax. This is confidential. Okay. Let's not jinx it. Okay, I'll see you then! - Bye! - Thank you, Arianna. Thank you. Bye! Let's keep this a secret first. My dreams are coming true! I can visit my mom's grave in Singapore! I finally have something to show up for in front of Sandy's family! I'm not just a singing waiter anymore! Yes! Find out where your mother is buried. For sure, that's the first thing you'll go to. And you'll probably visit every day for two years. I wouldn't want to be kept away from Sandy for so long. I'm sure she will be so proud of you. You think? Of course. Who wouldn't? You're finally achieving your dreams! You know Arianna, she's the first and last girl for me. It's really her. - You said that the world is hard... - Where are we? - Straight ahead. Just straight... Stop. - We can make it through - Ready... one, two, three! - I'm just here for you I only have one simple joy That I could make you look at me from time to time - What would the world be if I were alone? - Alright, just watch your step. But it would be so fun if we were together... - Can I love you? If that's alright with you. - Sandy... - Let's just laugh at this crazy world - this is for you. I'll be right by your side I'll do anything just for you. There. I'll do everything... I wish you'd be mine I wish you'd be mine This is exactly what I imagined when I was drawing my soul mate. Huh? Nothing. How are we going to dance when there's no music? I'm sorry. I used up my budget with the candles. But... don't you hear that? Huh? The music. I think so. It's really strong. The two of us... we have just one beat. Sandy... I love you. Oh... why? Why are you sad? My whole life, I was never really sure... if my family was happy... if I was happy. But now, I've never been more sure... with you. You know, when I first saw you... I had no doubts. When I saw you at the gate, I told myself, "She's my soul mate... but she doesn't know yet. " But I knew. I already knew. Sandy, thank you for this night. I'd have to say goodbye. What? I have some good news, Sandy. You're... leaving? Two years, Sandy. Two years in Singapore! I already have a job there. My band and I will play. I'm not just a waiter anymore. You can be proud of me! Sandy... I can finally pay our house debt. I can start a business. And if I have some extra cash, I'll buy you a ticket. And we'll explore Singapore together. You'll finally be able to visit your mother's grave. Yes. Isn't it lucky? Two years. I'll message you every day. And when I have enough load, I'll call you. We'll always chat through the webcam, okay? Because I'd always want to talk to you. Hey... why are you frowning? Aren't you happy for me'? I'm happy for you But... It's not you... it's me. Just tell me, Sandy. I can't. A long-distance relationship? Carlo, I'll just hurt you. Me... or you'? Us. I know it's hard to understand but... I don't want to be alone. I can't wait for you. I don't want to be left again. Sandy, I'll be coming back. That's also what my dad said before. He said he'll come back for us. Yes, he does come back but... we were never complete again. Sandy, I'm not your father. Please, believe me. Please, Sandy. I'm sorry. You're just too afraid to love, Sandy. Who said that I already love you? I'll be leaving someone behind... who can't wait for me. I've never felt this bad. What should I do? You know, if mom were still alive... she'd know what to do. Your son is growing up. When are you going to tell him? - Okay. Basically, everything's in place. - Yes, sir! Good! You're really resigning. I'm sorry, Bene. I just think that it's unfair that you're trusting me so much. But I'm not even sure what it is I really want. But you already know who you want. You're just afraid to admit it. I might have made you hope. At my brother's shoot, I think I made you think there's something between us. Sandy, is that a sin? That... you were able to show me that I needed to back off... because you finally found what you're looking for. Other people search their whole life to find a love like yours. Sometimes, they don't even find it. But you're being forced by the Universe. He is your soul mate. Is this your guitar'? Dwight, come here. Carlo'? Is... that my son'? Son... Come, give your mommy a hug, Carlo. I came all the way from Melbourne. Your father called me. You told me she's dead. No, no... it's not your father's fault, Carlo. We had an arrangement in Singapore. He will sign the divorce papers so I could marry Joseph. Dwight's father. But I can't contact you. I can never see you. You gave up your right to see him! You left us! Why won't I leave you?! You don't have dreams! I got tired of making a living for you! That's why you looked for a different guy! Now I'm the one at fault? Who else? - I was the one who brought him up. - Stop it! - What's your problem?! - I brought him up with Au... - because you weren't here! - I'm already here! Stop it. Stop it. Dad, do you remember... when I used to light candles for mom here during All Souls Day? Yes. I was really mad at your mother then. I wanted to get even with her. But I thought what would be better for you. Should I tell you that she's already dead. Or that you know the truth that she left you? I didn't think it was good for you to think that. You're a liar, dad. But you grew up to be a decent man, right? You're still a liar, dad. Forgive me, son. Dad. You know what hurls most? You're my idol, dad. And I told myself... I wish I was just like you. I rarely love... but when I do, it's forever. We're the same dad. Losers. But dad, that's where our similarities end. Because I will really work hard, dad. I'll make all my dreams come true. And when I finally have my own family, I'll do everything to provide for them. I don't want them to go through what we went through. Son... Yes, dad. Happy endings only happen in the movies. Why did you pause it'? It's your favorite part. True love's kiss. They're nearing their happily ever after. I can always rewind that. I can always go back. But I can never get this moment back. It's your fault, mommy. You and daddy's. Why did daddy have to leave us? But I thought you're happy when your dad visits. It's so hard to pretend... When I saw you get hurl... I told myself that I didn't want to end up like you. I don't want to be crazy in love. I don't want to be left behind. Because in love, there shouldn't be any separation, right? Sweetheart, there are different kinds of love. Sometimes, even if he's not here, you're still in his heart. You're the one who creates your own story of love. So you'll have your own happy ending. Just be brave enough to take a risk. You never know. The happy ending that I didn't have... is actually for you. I'm sorry. I know it was because of me that you got scared of loving. Please forgive me. Stop crying. I know you still have something to run after. I'll chase my happily ever after'? - I love you, sweetheart. - Thank you, mommy. - Take care commuting. - Love you, mommy! Sweetheart. Bye. Go! MY Payment. Dude, I bought this at a big discount. Carlo was having a rush sale. - It's still in good condition. - Yes, even this motorbike. - There's even a free helmet. - Yeah! Auntie Au... He's making me throw this. Tricycle! So he left you... that's why you don't believe in happy endings anymore? Because all happy endings for you are sad. They always leave you behind. But that's where you're wrong. Because I still have my own happily ever after. And how would you have a happily ever after when Carlo left you for Singapore?! Hi hon! Hey honey! Dindin informed me that you're still here. You're not yet done? Sandy and I are still talking about something. - We're not yet done. - I'll wait for you guys downstairs. - Yes honey. I'll see you downstairs. - Yes Okay. Well, I do hope for a happy ending for you someday, Sandy. You know Sandy, I think it's also timing. Imagine, if you didn't reject Bene... then we wouldn't have met... and we wouldn't have become close... and we wouldn't have gotten together. You know, I think love is full of surprises, isn't it? Hon, guess what'? The Korean investors just texted me. They said the artist had heart. So we got the deal! Oh my God! Congratulations, Sandy! Honey! You're an animator, my gosh! Sandy, congratulations. Thank you. Thank you, Sir Benedict. Oh my God! Thank you, Lord! So will see you guys downstairs. - Let's go! - Ah, okay. Wait a minute. I'll text everyone tomorrow and we'll celebrate! Okay. Congratulations! Congratulations again. Aren't you leaving yet? You're the only one left. It's alright. - I'm still waiting for something. - Are you sure? Okay, bye! Let's go! Congratulations! Hello, cactus heart! Hello, soul mate! You're really beautiful on the webcam. I'm only beautiful when it's blurry'? No, of course not. It's a good thing you got to call. I thought you were too busy. Is that possible? Sandy, it's our anniversary today. It's been one year since we got together, right? Sir, I think it's here. Yes here! Oh thank you, sir! Come, let's hurry! Oh, I think I forgot something inside. Hurry up. We might be late. Don't take too long. Carlo'? Carlo! - Carlo... - Sandy? Sandy... You're still here. Thank god I got to see you! I thought you already left! I'm still leaving. We still have a flight to catch. That's alright. I'm not going to stop you. I know you're doing this for your family. I know, Carlo, that this is your dream. I'm just here to apologize. I'm sorry because I was only thinking of myself. Carlo, I'm sorry for being so afraid. I'm sorry if I was too scared to love. I'm sorry. I'm sorry because I'm just a stupid girl. Sorry because the man I've been looking for is right in front of me... but I pushed him away. Carlo, I don't want you to leave without being able to say this. Huh? Carlo, I love you. I really love you, Carlo. I love you so much. Carlo, can you forgive me for what I've been doing? Carlo, can you ever give me a second chance? Yes! Yes? Yes... Yes as in yes? Yes as in yes! But Sandy, I still need to leave. That's alright. Carlo, I'll wait for you. One year. Two years. Three years! Even until the end of the world! That's how much I love you! Promise? Promise! Hurry up, Carlo. We'll be late! I really need to leave. We still have a flight. Wait a minute. Can I bring you to the airport? - Of course! - Please? Come on! Hurry up, we're going to be late. - Get in! - I'm riding too, okay? Okay! Go go go! You'll be coming home soon. That's still a long time. It's getting nearer. Six months, two weeks, and four days. Do you want to shorten that time? Every day, that's the only thing I look forward to. Because I want to have a happy ending. Alright. You go ahead. You might be late for your gig. On yeah, my gig That one is for the most special lady in the whole world. Special? Yes. And I love her very much. Love? Yup. I love her. Do you want to see her? Surprise! I told my boss that on this day, I had to see my soul mate. Oops! Be careful. You might get pricked. Sandy. Don't know what I'm feeling Every time I see you It's a strong feeling and it tenses me up inside. Every day I wonder Why my heart is like this Every move I make changes when you're near me Can't sleep at night just thinking You are my spirit's only dream Oh why are you always on my mind? With every moment, all I want is to see you. I rejoice whenever you stare at me. Oh what miracle is this I'm feeling? It's intense. How are you going to notice me? Would you ever know my heart's yearnings? What should my heart tell the one it loves? Every day I Wonder Why does my heart feel this way? My every move changes When you're around Can't sleep at night just thinking You are my spirit's only dream Oh why are you always on my mind? With every moment, all I want is to see you. I rejoice whenever you stare at me. Oh what miracle is this I'm feeling? It's intense. Can't sleep at night just thinking You are my spirit's only dream Oh why are you always on my mind? With every moment, all I want is to see you. I rejoice whenever you stare at me. Oh what miracle is this I'm feeling? It's intense. Can't sleep at night just thinking You are my spirit's only dream Oh why are you always on my mind? With every moment, all I want is to see you.
