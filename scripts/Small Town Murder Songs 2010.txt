And to live by the grace and God's holy community according to Jesus Christ's rule and way. The one who calls you is faithful and will do it. Amen. Amen. As I live and breathe, what's up Walt? You were doing No shit. Yep. Okay. Was that you up at Point Beach yesterday morning? Point ain't no dump. Have you been hauling your trash again? Just give me the ticket You want to dispute it? You know the number's on the back. You know, you no different than you was, no matter what you say The stories Rita can tell after a few drinks - oh! I'll say "hi" for you. New truck? Few years. She's a beaut. So what are you doing here, Walter? Just chasing my tail That so? How is he? Same as ever. Been trying real hard. Can't abide that kind of violence, its not how we was raised. You made your bed... Better tuck in. Alright. Heck of a day. Diner was packed. All those rural boys up from Barrie making a fuss. I was surprised none of them grabbed my rear, though I was ready with a smart come-back if they did. I can't remember what I was going to say. Damm. Been muttering it to myself all afternoon, now I can't remember. It was smart too. They didn't tip worth a damn. You'd think making forty dollars an hour, they could spare a few bucks. Jim? Okay. I'll get a sheet. Get it around the bend there. All sorts of stuff down there. Good day Seen better. Yeah, I'm sure. Detective Dave Washington. Chief Walter Ruden. Well.. uh.. Operator got a call there and ah said I need to come down here and I was thinkin' that it was just teenagers playing a prank or... No I.D.? Nothing. No purse. No wallet. Shit. Okay. You didn't touch her? No. No Sir. She ain't local. Are you certain? We're going to be here a few days, can you help us out with a motel? Yeah sure. We could give Mildred a call at the Super 8 there. She'll help yous out. I think I seen Steve Hinden's pickup... yeah... pulling down that road a couple days ago. Jim and I was up fishing and then I seen it drive up and dump something. What day was this? Sunday. Did you get a look at the driver? We were a ways out. License plate? But you recognize the truck? Hinden? H-I-N-D-E-N? Yeah, he's a real S.O.B. He used to run pot and coke for the Banditos before the Renegades ran them out. I wouldn't surprise me none. Well that ain't much, without a plate or an I.D., from the look of things, I'd wager she was killed right here. The pathologist will determine time and cause, but if she wasn't local, pickup could be from anywhere. You guys handle the locals here? Yeah? Yeah. That's great. Yep. Thank you, Walter Sorry about the inconvenience. Oh no, no, no, its - Will this do? Yeah, yeah, fine, fine. Grab Kevin. You guys can set up in here. Okay? First murder? Yep. Hell of a thing. Yep, you can say that. Listen Walter, I don't want to be stepping on your toes, so we're going to try and be in and out, okay? You know that lake pretty good? Practically born in it. How many properties around there? Its like three within half a mile and a dozen more beyond that. Okay. Good, good. They old order? Mennonites? Yeah. Some. You guys making out alright in here - or? Yeah, yeah, fine. Come in. Debrah. Hey! I'm talking to you. Hey! You want to sit and you want to talk like a civilized person, we can discuss the possibility of you going next year. Mom! You're twelve. There's a killer on the loose. Where's your damn sense? That's that. Hey Deb-Deb Dad! You're impossible! No! Honey - Did we know the girl? No. I told her no. Obliged. I told him it takes more than a few rocks to keep them from doing what they want. Wilson. Mike. You're early for your next cut. Wish it was. Got a minute? About the girl? Yup. My God. Can I finish with Mike? Course, course. Keepin the streets safe, ay Walt? Well, thanks Olive. That's real fine. Uh-huh. Now you have a cookie, dear. Thanks, Olive. Or do you want a digestive or one of these creams? No, no, no, Olive. Fix you a cucumber sandwich? No, no, no, no. Olive! This is fine. You sure? Yep. I'm sure. Hello, hello - I just made this cutie. Nice. Ah yeah, oh yeah. Are you sure I can't get you something? Yep. Just have a seat, Olive. Well, Olive. Might have heard. Found a girl down at Point Beach. Oh yeah. You found a girl? Oh. Oh Lordy. A real shame. Was it coyotes? How you mean? That took her. Oh no, we're pretty sure it was a fellow who'd done it. My cousin, Marie, swell girl, just beautiful. She had this, this- It was just- ah. May 12th they found her. We were the same age. Half the town walked in a line looking for her over at Jefferson Beach. Told us that, you know, stand arms apart. Walk. Boy, they was ready to string up poor Tom thinking he done it. And we walk for days, it seemed, until they found her. Killed. Did they find who did it? I don't... Uh... Damn coyotes dragged her off. Don't think finding them would have made a uh, uh - Just the way they is. Can't be helped. Should have seen her hands, though, boy... state your emergency. There's a girl. She's dead, up Point Beach in Grey Fork. M'am, we can dispatch an ambulance, but we need an address. No, no, she don't, she don't need an ambulance. Uh - Look, I'm just telling you that uh he found her and that she's just - and you just got to do whatever you do... M'am, I'm going to need more information. If you can stay on the line, I'm going to connect you with the - I'm, I'm sorry, I gotta go. Anything? Play it again. Go ahead. state your emergency. There's a girl. She's dead, up Point Beach and Gray Fork. Rita Louis, hot damn. Jesus Jim. Um, she's the one shacked up with that Steve Hinden character. The one with the red pickup? Yeah. Walter, you recognize the voice? Yeah. Its Rita. Lets bring them in. Sir, I'd keep your distance. I'll be fine. Easy. Hey, hey. I know, buddy. I know. Yeah. Did uh you want to sit in on this? Well, no, we got a history, so you fellows best on your own. Okay. Suit yourself. The whole night? Uh-huh. Yeah. Rita, I got to tell you that um any false information you provide- No, I get it. I get it- Its a criminal offence. Yeah. Look, he was home with me. Okay? I swear. Anyone else see you at all? I sure damn hope not. That would have... Cross my heart, pinky swear. He was with me. You just sounded pretty distressed in the 9-1-1 call. I thought- He found a dead, naked girl by the lake. Yeah, I was distressed. Fucking asshole. Sorry? Asshole. Nothin'? Nope. Frustrating, huh? Figurin' he done it? Wouldn't surprise me none. Hey, was it weird seeing her again? Sorry. Pow, right in the face. Biker drops to the floor like a sack of nothing. The bikers look over in terror like ole Walt just killed him. Hell of a scrapper he used to be. We'll be in touch. Don't be a stranger, killer. So, what'd he say? A lot of B.S., if you ask me. Said he was dumping trash and stumbled across the body. Had Rita call 9-1-1 from a pay phone 'cause he didn't want to get caught dumping the trash. Had lots to say about you, though, Walt, do you have any idea why's that? Yep. So, what? So, Rita says they were home all night, Saturday night, occupied, if you catch my meaning. Now as to why they waited almost two days to call 9-1-1 no answer for that. You guys need some spoons or stir sticks or something here, alright? So is that it - or? Biker Enforcement is on the phone for you- Yeah, I'll be right there. Is that it? Well, what do you want me to do Jim? Bust him for being an a-hole? We've got no time of death, we got no cause of death and no I.D. on the girl. Now I need you guys pulling double shifts, alright? Door-to-door, farm-to-farm 'til we get an I.D. on this girl. Get out there and ask around. Where you going? To ask around. Her underpants around her ankles? I'm afraid so. Did you pull them back up? What? Her underpants. Of course not. Why would I go touching her? What kind of business do I have with her underwear? Its so horrible. All you men standing around her poking her and taking pictures and she's left in that kind of state. Its a police investigation. And they got to find evidence and we can't go messing with it just 'cause it makes us uncomfortable. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, its just- I know you're doing everything right. Just feeling so- God, that poor girl. I'm sorry I'm such a crybaby. Oh no. Can we have a moment of prayer? You want me to put some coffee on? That'd be fine. I'm on track. I ain't like I was. Yeah. Hmm. Walter, you can't change who you are. But you can choose to act against your impulses. That's God's gift to humans. You need to ask: what kind of man do I choose to be? People will learn to forgive once you've chosen to walk in the shoes of a man. Thank you, Deacon. Sir, were you with the men that night? In English please, sir. Not too fond of people with guns. What about you? Not too fond about me either. Yeah, I was with them. Until what time? Any of the other men leave the farm that night? No. You sure? Yeah. Anyone come around? Anything out of the ordinary? Nope. - Nothing? All done. Good. Call it into Washington. Fine, we're done. Hey Sammy, what does it take to get some creamer around here? Oh, I swear this head would pop clean off if it weren't attached at the neck. There you go. You doin alright? Oh yeah, it just- I hear Walter sure got his work cut out for him, eh? Oh, I don't know. Only murder he seen is on the idiot box, CSI and whatnot. Don't imagine he'll be solving much. I'm sure the OPP'll do their thing. Yeah. Nothing. Ha ha. I'm just saying them London cops are much more interested in cleaning up their own backyard than ours. I hear Walter paid a visit to Rita's If he did, he did. Huh. He still got that temper? Huh yourself, Miss Busybody. I'm just sayin'- Look what all your talkin' gets me. Hey Walter, you caught that damn killer yet, or what? Some sweet pie for a sweet man. Thank you, Sammy. Want some more coffee? No, no. Thanks, Sammy. How you holdin' up, Gretta? Good, good, Walter, how 'bout yourself? You minding everybody else's business or just mine? Well, don't say you wasn't told. Coroner confirms the girl was killed around 11 PM Saturday night by strangulation and was moved post-mortem, suggesting she was in fact dumped. Tox-screen shows coke in her blood, but I can't find any priors on her. Nothing from town? No one saw anything or they're not saying, if they did. I gotta say, with no I.D., its not looking good. You keep pushing that sketch out province-wide. You know if it was drug-related, maybe we'll catch a break from known dealers. Yeah, um, what do you think about Mitzi's? The Henchmen have been dealing up there? Strip-parlour in Hanover. Yeah, its about 80 kilometers from here, right? Yeah, about 40 miles on the sideroads. They bring in from all over and change em up every week. Yeah, well, she certainly fits the bill of a dancer. Well, then I guess you boys get a paid trip to the peelers. What about the MTO, anything from them? Nothing yet. No news of the disappearance of 3 year old Jamie Smith, missing from her home outside Gray Fork since Thursday. Police are asking anyone with any information to please come forward. Family members have offered a $10,000 reward for any information that leads to her safe recovery. Think I should text Jenny and let her know we're here? Jim, grow up. G'afternoon. Good afternoon. What can I do for you, Walter? Its been a while. You remember Jim? Hello. Mitzi around? Nah, she just had another kid last week, a little girl named Mary, so she's taking it easy. You got that picture? I don't know if you've heard what happened. Yeah, I heard something. Have you seen her? Fuck. What? What happened? You recognize her? Yeah, Mitzi uh - shit. She brought her in last week Melissa somethin' from Hamilton maybe? When she didn't show up on Sunday, we thought she quit. We better call Washington. Sure thing. What happened? Too soon to say. Did she have any uh trouble up here? Any bad clients? Nah, I don't think nothing like that. We run a pretty tight ship these days. No drugs in the club. What people do outside, thats there own business, right? Mitzi fired a couple girls last months for performin' extras, but I ain't heard no complaints about Mel. Damn, that is fucked up. Give a warm round of applause for sexy Cindy. Thank you, Cindy. What did he say? Well, we're going to need a last name for Melissa, obviously, as well as a number for Mitzi. Oh yeah, yeah sure. Her husband's name is Jim, just like yours. He's going to be around shortly so uh- Hey Billy, you wanna get me a sprite? I'm fucking parched. Sure thing. Good afternoon, officers. G'afternoon. M'am. Here you go, darlin'. Cheers. Hey sweetie? Can you give us a minute? Don't mind me, I'm just being a snoop. No point getting them all worked up hearing things until we know what's what, right? I'm afraid not, might need talking to. One more thing- This fellow - have you seen him around here? Oh yeah, yeah, of course, he was up here for karaoke on Saturday. You're kidding. No-no, no-no, very comical, if you ask me. Son of a gun got up and he kept singing the same song over and over again, buying girls drinks. Looked like him anyway. Was Melissa working here Saturday? Yeah, if it was karaoke, she was here. You're telling me that Steve Hinden and Melissa were both here Saturday night? Yeah. Best as I can recall. Whatcha thinkin'? Don't know. Steve was there partying then. You know that means Rita is lying. Yup. Don't like the look of it. What's the plan, Walt? I was thinkin' I should talk to Rita. That ain't a good idea, Walt. We gotta call Washington. I'll talk to him first thing in the morning. I need... Alright, alright. You gonna come in for a beer? No. Gonna tuck in. Alright. Walter. 'Evenin' 'Evenin' Rita. Sorry to be um- You can't come 'round like this. No I- I know, I know it. Hey, hey Jury, Jury, in the house, in the house, come on. God damn dog ain't got no damn sense inside him. This Steve, he here full-time now? That ain't none of your business, Walter. And you can't come by the house no more. I'm done with it, k? We're done. You were lying to the OPP. I ain't. Rita- What? Look me in the eye and tell me he was with you. No. Rita- He was with me. The whole night? Bartender puts him at Mitzi's with the girl same night she died. Then he finds the body. Don't look good. You're lying to the OPP. Oh fuck you, Walt. You had no problems when I was lying for you. I'm just trying to help you. Well, I don't need your help. Yeah, he didn't do it. Well you don't know that. Guys like him, they- Oh give it up, Walter. Guys like him. There ain't no fairytale in your head gonna fix it and that's that. Come on, Jury. Jury- God damn son of a bitch- I can handle it. I'm calling the cops! Steve Hinden, I can God damn handle it! Call the cops and get off our property! Ain't your property! Get off the fucking property! Shut the fucking dog up, Rita! You stupid fuck. She don't want to see you no more, you hear? I've had enough of your shit! Hey, you want another beer, dad? No, I'm good. Thanks, darlin'. Whatcha watching? I don't know. Something foolish. I never know what's on. What got into you? What, no, its nice. Its just- half the time its a struggle to get more than two words out of you. You angling to go to the drive-in or- No. What? I can't be nice? That's okay, Tiger. Its just unexpected, is all. You're always nice. Has this business gettin' to you? With the girl- Yeah, a bit. Me too. ...however, OPP have been forced to allocate much of their resources to Hanover after a triple homicide has been linked to a surge in biker activity. Hello, you are on the air with radio talk news Hi Jeff, I just have to say that I think this is a travesty for our community. If the OPP aren't going to pursue this, then who's going to stand up for that girl? Who's going to do what's right? There's a killer in our midst and who is going to stand up and make this town safe again? I mean, who's going to make this right? Thank you very much for your call. And by calling in you could have one two tickets to the Maynard Ti-cats next game. Good morning. Yeah.. Yeah.. Walter, was there any reason you didn't call me as soon as the bartender placed Steve at Mitzi's? I uh- I got a call last night. A complaint, actually, from Steve Hinden and Rita Louis. They've asked for a restraining order against you. Now I ain't a judge, ain't none of my business and I told them so. I told them who to call and all that, but she tells me that you two were in a relationship up until about 6 months ago, that it was pretty serious. What, you weren't in a relationship with Rita Louis? What you two didn't live together? I told you we had a history. Oh for God's sake, Walter. Don't be an idiot. I know all about you, I know about your past, I know about SIU. You were with her for two years, she left you for Steve and now it looks like you're trying to pin this killing on him. No, no, it ain't like that. Walter, open your eyes. We have one suspect in this case and now I'm not going to be able to bring him in. Even if he did it. No! Even if he confessed, he's just going to claim improper conduct. Ain't no fucking judge gonna say contrary, not when some local cop has been harassing them in the middle of the fucking night. Alright, look it. I'm just, I'm just going to let it be where it is. We have to take the long road on this. You can't see them no more, you can't talk to them and you sure can't touch this case. You're done. Are we clear? Okay. Well, lets just get through the God damn day. Why don't you pick up the girl's mother and take her to I.D. the body. Can you handle that? Then you go home. ...Wallace across to Delver. Still no word of 3 year old Jamie Smith believed abducted from her school on Friday while playing in the schoolyard. Police suspect her abductor- They ain't gonna find him, are they? And even if, what then? Couple years. No difference. I still won't have my Mellie. Couple years. If a dog had done it, they'd put him down. You think that's fair? Is that justice? Or just a waste of time? Dear Lord, we give thanks for the food before us and the shelter over our heads. We thank you for your guidance and your love. Amen. Amen. Jan is scared out of her wits, says she won't let the kids go swimmin' because of it. Not 'til she knows who done it. You believe that? Like the whole lake is contaminated or something. You think Terry McNeil is going to stop parking up at the Point Please. I swear that boy didn't wait 12 hours before he was boasting about doing his business up there. There's gotta be a fine or somthing for that right? Boy. He sets no example for his brothers. Oh! And worse than everything, Mary D. had her fat arse perched on a barstool all afternoon. Spoke her filth about how that girl was a W-H-O-R and got what God gave her. Just appalling, talking that way about another woman, another person even. No sense speaking in a public place neither. You know I ain't never been to a men's parlour or what you call'em, but I can just bet you that them girls is just people. Probably got kids need taking care of, mortgages over their heads like everyone else. God forbid I should say that to Mary D., she'd probably lose her mind. Her fat, little head would probably pop right off, it get so red like a beet. Those dancing girls may as well be the devil incarnate in her mind. I know you're treating her like a lady, doing your best to find who done it. Baby, what? What's up? What? No, no, no, no. No, this is too much. You must tell the truth. Get out! You have to tell the truth! Out! Out! Get out! Out! Rita! You fucking retard! What's wrong with you? Oh my God, what's wrong with you? Huh? You tell me what- what am- I fucking hate you, I never want to see your stupid fucking face! Go! Off our fucking property! Steve! Take a hint. She hates you, you pathetic fuck. Stop embarrassing yourself and go home. Jesus, what do we gotta do? I know what you done. I know what you done. Fuck that's it, I'm calling Jim. You're not calling- Walter! Walter! Walter! No! Steve! Fuck! Leave him be goddamnit! He's already fucking down! Let go! How's Rita? You're gonna have to come with me. I almost- I could have put him down. But, I'm not an animal. I can't be like that anymore. He did it, right? You think I did the right thing? No. But whatever you did, Rita turned Steve in.
