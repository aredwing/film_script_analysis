Despite Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, slavery is alive and well in the Wild West, in the form of prostitution, the world's oldest profession. In Kansas and most of the western territories, women are bought, sold and traded like property. TRADED Come on Pa, show me how! All right, all right, now I'm gonna do this one time, all right? Now the idea is when the tyin's bein' done, you wanna flex your muscles. Blow your chest up like a rooster. What's a rooster do? Cock-a-doodle-doo! That's right, now you see, when the tyin's done, you relax your muscles, blow all the air outta your chest... And now look, the rope gives ya just enough room so you can get yourself free. Show me how Pa, show me how! Maybe after supper. And your studies. The capital of Kansas is Topeka, and the President of the United States is Chester Alvin Arthur. Chester Alan Arthur. Chester Alan Arthur. Can we ask him now, Ma? Before the day's activities sour his disposition? What do you care about some stupid old dance anyway? You hush up! Do my eyes deceive me? Is that a... Apple pie. I picked, peeled and sliced all the apples, and then spiced them with cinnamon. Clay, Lily was invited to a tie dance, over at the Tigman Ranch. You know apple pie is my favorite. Spiced with cinnamon. The dance is the girls wear a calico dress and they bring a matching tie for the boys to choose. Now I am familiar with the procedure of a tie dance, young lady. In fact, there was a time... It wasn't so long ago, as a matter of fact... Flies in the buttermilk? Yuck! Well Pa, can I go? I'm sorry Darlin'. Maybe next year. But Pa! You know what this pie needs? My teeth? Some honey. I'll fetch some. Well last summer you let me work at the Mercantile. Nellie Wilcott is 16 and she's been proposed to. Darlin'... Nellie Wilcott is not my beautiful little girl. It's just a tie dance Pa. Besides, if I ever do find a beau, once he meets you, he'll be too scared to ever call on me again. Darlin', I'm sorry. Now this matter is settled. I wanna have my dinner in peace. How long does it take that boy to fetch some honey? I'll get him. They're gonna come callin' Clay. And we both know that extra year is for you, not her. Amelia you's the one what told me what your dancin' days led to. I was dancin' at the Broken Spoke Saloon, not the Tigman's front parlor. And I didn't have two loving parents. That's my little girl. If I ain't gonna protect her, who's gonna? Ma! Pa! Lily? My god! Jake? Jake! What happened? Come here. Watch out, watch out! You can take comfort, Mr. Travis, in knowing that Jake is in a much better place. All due respect Reverend, I'd rather have my boy standing right here beside me. I am sorry for your loss. For the life of me, I just can't remember the sound of his voice. I'd give anything to hear his voice one more time. He was my little boy. He's an angel. Blame me. Just say it. I'm the one who asked for the honey. Blame me. -Amelia. -Blame me! Come on! Blame me! Blame me! Blame me! Blame me, blame me, blame me! I need you to! Please blame me! Please? We're nearly outta firewood. I'll go chop some. Mama. I love you, it's gonna be okay. Where are you off to? Going to the lake. I... Need you to stay here and help me with the canning. But Ma, you never asked me to help you before. I thought you said canning's the one job you like to do all by yourself. This time I want you helpin' me. I done all my chores, all my bookwork, I was really lookin' forward to going to the lake. There's no tellin' who's out there. Last time I was out there, it was just old man Hill. That was nearly a year ago and... Just had to help him bait his hook. I also want your daddy checkin' that boat for leaks. But Ma, the boat is fine. You're stayin' here and helpin' me can these tomatoes! Why are you bein' silly? Don't you dare call me names. Amelia. Isn't that just like you? Takin' her side. Lily, Darlin', I want you to stay here and help your Mama with the canning. Just for today, this one time. Sweetie, I'm gonna go down and check that boat for leaks. Okay? Be a good girl. Don't be doin' me any favors Clay. Lily get up, you've slept long enough! Lily! Lily! Lily, your Mama is callin' you. Probably just in the privy or the barn. Not possible. I was awake before dawn. Lily's horse is missing, I'm going over to Jane Thompson's. Can't find Lily nowhere. Took her horse and left in the middle of the night. Jane Thompson. You tell Mrs. Travis what her daughter confided in you. Or that matchin' blue bonnet goes right back to Abilene! Woah. She's gone to Newton to catch a stage to Wichita. She read an advertisement about becoming a Harvey girl, waitress like Jane's sister. Thank you. I'd like a ticket to Wichita please. Just one? Yes sir. That'll be 50 cents. Visitin' family, are ya? No, my family lives 'round these parts. Employment? Why yes, I'm hopin' to get a position as a Harvey girl. I've heard a lot of good things about that outstandin' company. Coach leaves in 10 minutes. Thank you. Good luck with your... Job huntin'. How do you do ma'am? I'm well. Name's Rig Marlowe. Lily Travis. Well, Lily like a flower. Pleased to meet you. Has anyone told you that you look like sunshine in the morning? You think you're gonna need that? Lily's horse, all cooled down. Limber and well-fed. You won't find a finer animal in town. Where's the owner? You're lookin' at him. That's my daughter's horse, where is she? I don't know. Fella gave me a dollar to ride that horse back. Where did she go? I don't know. But I'm keepin' that dollar. This girl been in here? What's she to you? She's our daughter. The boy's a spittin' image of you. We're lookin' for the girl. She has reddish-brown hair. Down to here. Reddish-brown you say? Have you seen her? She don't look nothin' like you. Have you seen the girl? Did she buy a ticket? No. Pretty little girl like that, that hair? I'd remember her. You son of a bitch. Clay. Clay, let's go, come on now. Maybe she changed her mind and she's still in town? Fella in there is lyin' to you. I think it's time you told me everything you know. She left a couple hours ago on the stage to Wichita. Honest to god, or strike me dead. I'm going to get her. You head back to the ranch. I'm not losing another child, Clay. Go to mercantile, get us some supplies. I'm gonna go in and deal with this fella. Be back here in five minutes. Clay, Lily told Jane she ran off because of our... Because of my ill temper and distress. Five minutes. Take your glasses off. Pardon me? Take your glasses off. You son of a bitch! Ma'am? That fella you were with, he gave me a note to give ya. He said you'd give me two bits. Thank you ma'am. My darlin' Amelia, do not follow me. I'll find our daughter and I'll bring her home safely. Love you always. Your husband done this to me! Crazy son of a bitch. He done this to me! Broke my damn nose! 'Scuse me ma'am, would you happen to know where they're hiring the Harvey girls? Thank you, thank you very much. Woah.

You remind me of a young'in that passed through here, fire in his eyes like yours. I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told him. There's a battle in every man. Two wolves that exist inside each of us. One's evil and anger, the other's love and hope. You know which one wins? The one you feed. Which one you gonna feed, Hoss? What can I do ya for? I'm lookin' for Rig Marlowe. Gent with the red vest, poker table with Charlie and Silas. You got chips at the bar here? I do. Thank you. Much obliged. You gentlemen lookin' for a fourth?

Named Lily Travis. She was walkin' to your saloon this morning with Rig Marlowe. Haven't seen her. But I'm in and out all day, I'm... Wichita's Fire Chief. Maybe you outta ask Marlowe. I did. Well if Marlowe doesn't know, then... Whoever gave you that information must be mistaken. It's not that he didn't know, he couldn't tell me. He's dead. Mr. Travis? Clay Travis. Mr. Travis. I may run a brothel... But I run it in accordance with the law. Maybe you're right. 'Bout my information bein' wrong. I apologize for takin' your time sir. It's quite all right. Close the door. Have you seen this girl? She's got reddish-brown hair. 17 years old. No, I haven't seen her Sugar. Why are you singin' that song? I heard one of the girls singin' it today.

You got two seconds to tell me what I wanna know before I pump you full of lead. Where is she? Where? Get the hell outta here. We don't want that kind of trouble. I guess we know which wolf won. What did you expect? It's his daughter. What would you do if someone disappeared one of your kin? I reckon I'd feed the same hungry beast. Son of a bitch! Where is she? Mr. Travis! You have to believe me! Where? When I tell ya that I have no idea where your daughter is. I don't know what Marlowe did with her! Where is she? Fuck you! I should've killed you in my goddamn bar! You son of a bitch! Where is she? Cut me loose and I'll tell you! Cut me loose. Tell me first! I traded her! You traded my daughter? That's right, I traded her. Traded her for what? I traded her for that fuckin' bell! You traded my daughter for a goddamn bell? Yeah. I did. To who? LaVoie! Where the hell is he? He's on a train. Train to where? Dodge City. Now, set me free... Or you'll die in this town. You're a dead man. You'll die right here, you won't ever get out. I'll set you free. Set me free goddamn it! Yeah, I'll set you free! Train to Dodge? Train just left. Clay Travis. Damn, I knew it was you. You killed five men in Abilene. Nearly 15 years ago. Yeah. You killed my best friend Willie Parker. Just turned 17. He drew first. That ain't what he told me before he died. Some men choose to cast themselves in a brighter light before they meet their maker. And Kansas soil's full of fools who thought they were quicker. Ya! Come on! Come on, come on! Ain't no damn way he's gonna catch that train. Lily? I'm sorry ma'am. Ticket. I didn't have a chance to buy a ticket. Five dollars. Five? How long does it take to get to Dodge? Day's end. If nothin' goes wrong. What do you got in that coach back there? Empty. Like your goddamn head. Maybe I'll take a seat back there. Maybe you'll sit your ass right where you're at. Train's movin'. It's dangerous. Five minutes to Dodge City. Five minutes. Hey! Get outta there! Apples, fresh apples, two cents a piece. Three for a nickel. Apple? Two cents a piece. Apples, fresh apples. Two cents a piece, three for a nickel. Care for an apple sir? Two cents a piece. Care for an apple sir? Fresh apples. Two cents a piece. Mister, are you alive? Who are you? Name's Girl. Girl? They call me Girl 'cause I'm too ugly to have a name. Where am I? Shack. Dodge City. This your sweetheart? Give me that. That's my daughter. Right pretty. You live here by yourself? Me and my Pa. He's not my real Pa, but... He was married to my Ma before she was took by the angels. Where is he? Workin'. He'll be home tonight. He always comes home every night. I gotta use your privy. Out back. Pa's got the key. This here's silk. It still smells like my Mama's lavender scent. She said she got it from France? I don't know where that is, but I know it ain't anywheres near here. Europe. France is in Europe. Know what I made outta this here silk? A dress? Why would I waste it on that? I made this fine table covering. For fancy company. Well with what you got left, you should make yourself a dress, I bet you'd look real pretty in it. You got a wife Mr. Clay? Yes I do. Your ranch very large? It's big enough. After you find your daughter, maybe I could go back to your ranch with you? I'm a real hard worker and I can cook, and I hardly eat anything. What about your Pa? Ain't he gonna miss ya? Ain't you gonna miss him? Well... Yeah, skin him, cook him up for stew. Yes Pa. This food here, ain't for free, stranger. I appreciate your daughter tendin' to me. I give you my word I'll repay you. Well we can't eat promises, now can we? I'm presently lookin' for my own daughter. I believe she's been imprisoned in town as a whore. Tomorrow you give me a full day's work and then I'll decide if it's enough. Time is crucial to me, sir. I'd appreciate it. Hey! You can't leave me shackled here! Girl! Give him a pot to relieve himself with. And you get your ass in the back room. Now! Oof! Son of a bitch! We start work at sun up 'round here. I hope you like bacon, eggs and hot biscuits Mr. Clay. Now what's this? I made a fine table covering outta my mama's silk from Paris. Paris? This came from your mama's shack in Abilene. A horny merchant came by and... He exchanged this red silk for some afternoon pussy. You see, her mother was a... Silver dollar whore. And she deserved every purple trophy that she got. You're a rotten liar. Say that again Girl! Nothing. I hope we didn't rile your slumber last night. I mean we, Girl and me, well we rattled them floorboards didn't we Girl? You know she got a face that'll kinda break a lookin' glass. But thank the Lord. She got her mama's pussy. This is a feast fit for the mayor himself. I may have to have you work two days for me boy. Damn! You know how I like my biscuits. Smothered with honey. Now you go and bring me that honey. Unshackle me. 10 dollars I squirreled away from Pa. Take it Mr. Clay. You'll be needin' it to find your daughter. Thank you. Hey mister, someone's lookin' for you in the Lady Gay. Who's lookin' for me? Room nine. You sure you got the right fella? Hey Sugar, do you wanna poke? I'm lookin' for room number nine. Long time. Nell Craft. Damn you Clay Travis. I was hoping you'd be all scarred and wrinkled like a dried-up prune. Been a long time. You work here? Not much interest in a 40-year-old whore. I own the place. Nell, you look great. The hell I do. I wasn't quite sure how you'd react if we ever saw each other again. Likewise. Is there somethin' I could've done different Clay? Anything different to get you to stay? Nell... Because I believe I did just about everything a girl could possibly do. And then some. In the end, I guess I just ended up falling in love with a different... Whore? Different woman. How is our dear Amelia? She's out of sorts. For old time's sake... Can I trust you Nell? For old time's sake. This is our daughter. Pretty thing. How old? She's 17. She arrived this morning, by train in a cattle car with a few other young girls, under the gun of a man named LaVoie. LaVoie recruits new girls. The demand exceeds the supply in Dodge. Where do I find LaVoie? Even you are no match for LaVoie. Samuel Colt's been known to make all men equal. If he's got your daughter, she'll never be the same little girl you remember. My advice to you? Go home. Be with your Amelia and that little boy. I can't do that. Then stay here with me. Let me show you what you've been missing. Where's LaVoie, Nell? He took possession of a whore house across the way. Calls it the French Chateau. Good seein' ya again Nell. Likewise. While you boys are gallivanting around town, I need you to gather me up some strays. You mean girls? Cats, roans living here outnumber the whores. I found me a rat almost the size of a beaver this morning, Daddy. Wasn't Uncle Barkley supposed to be on the train this morning? He has some important business to attend to, son. Now. My brother has had his shortcomings in the past, it's true. But when I left that man at that depot in Wichita, he was clear-eyed and sober. Praise the lord. Mama always said Uncle Barkley was gonna find the Lord's hand. I ain't never been accused of being a church-going man now have I Kipp? No sir. But in this case, I'm gonna have to align myself with your Mama. Because nothin', now you all listen up, nothin', and I mean nothin' in the whole world, is more important than family. A family, in harmony, will prosper. In everything. That's an old Chinese proverb. That's one we should all live by. Yeah Daddy. Bless the Chinese. Come in. Before you start talkin', I need one of ya to talk for both of ya, understand? All us girls got some demands. We want to be treated proper. Enough sleep so we don't got darkness under our eyes. A few minutes to ourselves between turns. A day off. Proper doctoring, not just a quick sideways glance at our snatch. Anything else? That's the gist of it. Anything else you wanna discuss? Now when they ask you, you tell 'em that whore's snatch went dry, and she left town to try her luck in Colorado, understand? Anything else... You'll end up just like her. Now get! Afternoon gents! Welcome to the French Chateau. Women to the left, liquor to the right. Hey. Afternoon. Lee Crawford. But you can call me LaVoie. Hey Kipp, get this gentleman here my best glass of whiskey. Yes Daddy. That's my son. Welcome. Good boy. What brings you out 'round these parts here, friend? A girl. Girl? Well Cowboy, you in the right place. Tess! This here Tess. She's awful purdy and young, but I'm lookin' for somethin' a little different. -Different? -Different. Well this one ain't for sale. But it's your lucky day, Cowboy. We just got a shipment of young gals, just ripe and fine for the plucking. But they ain't cheap, see that? Ten dollars. All right. Tess, take this fine gentleman upstairs right now! And I'm gonna send a girl up there once they have her all polished up for you. All right, I ain't gonna forget you now. Hey Kipp, what do you think? I don't like him. I don't like him either. I don't like him at all. This way, Honey. We'll take real good care of you. Don't worry, the curtains are for the three dollar whores. You paid for a private room. Don't be nervous Sweetie. We cater to all types here. The new girl will help you out. No! No! No! Please. Shut your mouth! Get up, you son of a bitch! Pa! -Hey! -Go ahead. I'll put a bullet right between your eyes. Please help. Come on Darlin', come on. Come on now. Jed! What? Come on daughter. Son of a bitch! Goddamn it, go get him! Come on, damn it! Take her outta here! I'm not leavin' you! I'm so sorry! Run! You better run little girl, run run run! Can't have you runnin' off and stealing the merchandise! We got a surprise for you today! What you want Mills? Telegraph for your father. Get the fuck on! God, what have I done? It's all right. I'm so sorry. Clay Travis. I believe you're familiar with a Nell Craft? You did her quite an injustice, years back in Abilene. You neglected to tell me that you had kinfolk under my roof Mr. Travis. I'll pay you whatever you want to leave my daughter alone. I bet you would! But money ain't an issue. See, you killed a man, in Wichita. He drew on me first! And that man. Was my brother. You kill my family, I will have my pound of flesh. Now I could just put a bullet in your fuckin' head right now, but why do that? Why not have some fun, why not? Blacksmith said this was the best he could muster up boss. All right, that's good enough. Tie him up, tie him good. Hell yeah! Good fortune done brought you back here, friend. But I don't reckon you'd agree, would ya? Sir, a lady's causin' a ruckus downstairs about the girl you shot. I don't care! These women, you can't live with 'em, and you can't live without 'em. Now another thing I took away from my time with the Chinese... Gatherin' info. See, during the war, say when you're in a position with some information, this here done did the trick. Opened them Union boys right up. See, this rodent here? The only thing on this rodent's mind, is this here fire, and how to get away from it. I seen grown men call out for their mamas. Beggin' for a bullet in the head. And when that rat realizes there's no way out, he's gonna start gnawin' away at your skin. He's gonna gradually eat his way through your insides. Tears a hole from your gut through your back. Yeah. Now you two, you stay here, until our little rat friend here has done his job. And that's when you can see this table through his stomach, okay? And no matter how much he begs, don't put a bullet in him. Hey! Travis. I'll be seein' ya friend. I can abide by shootin' an unruly whore. But no man should be tortured like this. And it's gross. Jed. Jed, come back. It doesn't seem right for her to leave town without saying a word, she was my friend. Ivory said she heard gunshots from your office. Yeah, yeah that's right. Gunshots? Fellas, you and Mills showin' off your draw. Right Mills? Yeah, yeah, that was me! Dumb son of a bitch. It's not right for her, she would not leave town without saying a word. She did express a very strong desire to leave Dodge City. And I obliged. Now, I suspect your paths will cross... Again. Sooner or later. In Colorado, yes? Now either of you got any other complaints about how you're being treated? If you do, you come see me. And I'll arrange your travel. Just like I did for Fran. Now get back on that goddamn floor and sell those asses, now! Son of a... What the hell? What the hell? I want him dead! You know where to look, go kill that son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Kipp, Jed, get your asses down here! Now! What you need boss? Yes Daddy? You killed her, you killed that poor girl! Son of a bitch! You touch my daughter? I'm gonna send you straight to hell! Quit hidin' you coward! Come out here, you chicken shit! How do you like that? Shit. Fuck you! I'll be damned, Mr. President. You caught the damned train. I've been thinkin' about what you said at the Spur. Figured you could use a hand. Obliged, friend. I ain't for anyone beatin' no women. One wolf to another, I reckon I'd done the same thing. And if it was my daughter, I'd kill that son of a bitch dead. Now go get the son of a bitch. Come upstairs with me? I'm just here for whiskey, I'm not armed, I'm not armed. Somebody's shootin' downstairs! Where's he at? Drop it, drop it! -Easy. -Where is she? She ain't here. Lips or lead boy, you're gonna show me. You're gonna show me! You son of a bitch. Behind you! Son of a bitch! Where's my daughter? Kipp! I'm not askin' again. I ain't afraid to meet my maker. Family? When one piece is missin', whole thing's broken. You broke mine! You know what this was gonna be? This was gonna be the best goddamn whore house west of the Mississippi. And your daughter's pussy was gonna buy me a couple farms. Open your mouth! Open! Bite down on the barrel. Now someone tell me where my daughter is. Ain't no trains for a good minute. No sir. Long ways back where you come from. Yes sir. Longer still on your own two feet. Reckon you could use a horse. I reckon I got a horse. What will you do? Reckon I'll go somewhere quiet, put my feet up and retire these here boots. It's been a long road, and I'm tired. But I'll find my way home. Take care friend. Pa, who was that man? He's just an old friend. Ma! Ma? Ma? Ma! Maybe she's in the barn? Lily! Wait! Lily!
