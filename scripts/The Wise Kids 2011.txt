Oh, the one Jesus used? Well, let's pretend it's not. (HAMMER STRIKING NAIL) OK, OK... Can you maybe gimme a little more than that? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, it's gotta be real. You gotta be real...

Are you gonna invite Amanda? - Who? - Amanda, from school. I thought you liked her. Um, as a friend. We've gotta find you a woman. It's just gettin' so good. It's just gonna be so good, Austin. That should do it. Thanks, Harry. That's nice. That was crazy, huh? So, are we still having ladies meeting at the same time next week? We actually moved it, um, to Wednesday. Instead of 7:30, it'll be 8. - OK. - If that's OK. Hmm... Uh... Where's Ryan? Oh, shoot. Tim, do you mind getting on the cross? - Awesome. - Yep. So, yeah, just... Like this? Uh, yeah... I guess it... works. So, that's probably long enough, right? Uh... Yeah... Yeah, let's get you down. Yeah. (CHATTERING) Hey, guys... Brea, did you wanna work on our duet later? - Sure. - Cool. Dear Heavenly Father, It's such an amazing pleasure and an amazing honor to be worshipping Your name through song and dramatic art. We ask that You bless this pageant so that others might see You and want to know You more. And we ask that You bless the food we're about to eat to the nourishment of our bodies so that we might better serve Your awesome, incredible, amazing name. In Your awesome, holy, amazing, awesome, awesome name, we pray, Amen. ALL: Amen. So, what are the college plans, guys? Brea and I are going to Weatherford. I mean, we applied. But we'll get in, it's not like it's hard. Thanks. Fabulous school. Very Christ-centered. Tim's goin' to New York. He already got in. Wait, what? Yeah, I got into the New School. It has a pretty great film program, so... I have family in New Jersey. You should look them up... At your own risk. That's a bit far away, don't you think? Well, I mean... From where, you know? What about Savannah? Doesn't Savannah have a good film program? Hey there, thespians! How we doin' today? Hey there. Hey, I know there's a lot of youth here, and I just wanna introduce you guys to a couple folks. This is Dylan All and his lovely wife Erin. Dylan's up for consideration for Youth Minister, so we're gonna be doin' kind of a trial period for him over the next couple of weeks, and we're gonna see how everything works out, and everybody gels and whatnot. You're gonna do Sunday School with him on Sunday, and he's gonna be around for this glorious pageant that Austin is creating for us. It's just gonna be an all-around great time. Woo hoo! I like your style. All right, now y'all go back to eatin'. Brea, can I see you for a sec? I need you to pick up your brother and Haley at the mall. Are they on a date? Can you do that for me? I need to make a visit. Where are your keys? I've just been praying so hard that God would send us the right man for the job... - So, New York? - Yeah. Gonna need someone, you know, like really cool and on fire for God. - We are very cool, so... - Dylan. So sorry to interrupt, I just had to introduce myself. I'm Elizabeth, I'm Austin's wife. I lead the Women's Ministry here, so... Elizabeth's awesome at everything. Thank you. (LAUGHS) Nice to meet you. It's such a pleasure to have you here. Thank you, very much. There they are. (CAR HORN HONKS) Hey y'all. So Josh... Brea says you're thinking about following in your Dad's footsteps. Uh, maybe... yeah. I think I'd be a pretty good preacher. - Is he gay? - Shhhh. No. - Was that loud? - Yeah. (CAR RADIO PLAYS) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Did you ever think about, like... what we'd believe, if our parents believed different things? Yeah, I guess I see what you mean. (PHONE VIBRATES) Oh, she's comin'. Oh, good, good. I mean... They could have taught us anything, and... we would have believed it. I don't know. I think I pretty much believe it on my own. Really? Yeah, I think so. Hmm. Oh, wait. Check this out. Boo!!! (SCREAMS LAUGHS) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Laura, honey, are you excited about Weatherford? Yes, ma'am. Y'all are gonna have a blast. So, are you really, like... you know... Um... I think so. How do you feel about that? Well, I double checked, and it's definitely wrong. OK. I can send you the verses if you want. Sure. Hey, you know... I'm gonna work this out, OK? I mean, this is... I'm still totally a believer in Christ. I'm still definitely a Christian, and I wanna do what God wants, I do. I really want to. I've just gotta, like, pray about it and stuff. It's like, a thing you work out. It's gonna be OK. I... I hope you'll get help. I think you should. 'Cause you can't be both. That's like... That's like, a paradox. Well, that went well. Don't worry about it. She's tryin' to... Night. Night, Laura! Night. Are you really OK with this? Um... I will e-mail you the verses. (HOCKEY COMMENTARY PLAYS ON TV) Is everybody sleepin'? Keri's at a movie. - Oh, what movie? - Somethin' stupid. How was your day? What? How... was... your... day? Oh... (LAUGHS) I'm gonna watch a movie and go to sleep. You can watch it in here, I'm not watchin' this. No. You're not watchin' it either, Brad. I don't think you'd like this one, Dad. - No. No. Night. Say your prayers. Night, Brad. Later. (PLAYING PIANO, SINGING HYMN) - Hello. - Hello. Welcome to the piano. Play me a song. Huh? Play a song for me. Play you a song... OK, here we go. (PLAYS HYMN) No... Originate it. I have to practice. Originate me a song. Well, I don't know, um... (TINKERS WITH MELODY, CHORDS) I'm not feeling it... I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I don't know what to sing. I gotta practice the real stuff for church. I'm sorry... I'm sorry. (DEEP SIGH) Please, Lord, show Tim that there's a way out... Please just watch over him tonight... (CONTINUES PRAYING) Please, just watch over him tonight... That's all I'm asking. Please, please, please. (GASPS) I had a bad dream. What? I had a bad dream, Mama. Oh, honey... honey... (PEOPLE CHATTERING) - Mornin', ya'll. - Mornin'. - How are y'all doin'? - Good. Good. So... I'm doing this 'trial period' thing, and they wanted me to give teaching the Youth Class a whirl. So here we are. My wife is stuck with the old people, so this worked out pretty well for me. (LAUGHS) Would the preacher's daughter like to open with prayer? Sure. Dear Heavenly Father: We thank You for this day and for all who gathered here to worship You. We ask that You teach us something today and work in our hearts so that others might see You in us. In Your name we pray, Amen. Amen. Let's go outside! So, today's lesson, I've called Nature as Love. And what I kinda want to talk about is... Well, not just God's creation. I'm sure you were kinda overloaded with that stuff when you were kids. But about God's creation... everything that we see, feel, smell, touch, as, literally... literally, like, the... embodiment of God's love. Right? It's the stuff... It's the physical stuff his love is made of. And we live amidst it. We live in it. And I think that's awesome. So as you... Yeah, go for it, buddy. Would that include people? Would what include people? Nature. I mean... We're nature, right? Yeah. So are we a part... of God's gift to each other? Yeah... Yeah, sure! Hey there. Well, good mornin', sweet girl. It's nice to see your pretty face. - Hey, Cheryl. - Hey. She always says hello to me. I know. I'm always here to your left. Tell me, Brea, how's your life? Good! Just waitin' on college decisions and all that stuff. You'll be leavin' me soon, won't ya? Oh, not for a few months. And I'll be back, don't worry. My favorite girl is leaving me, Cheryl. I like your dress, Brea. Thanks. Pretty dress, pretty girl. OK, I gotta get up there and sing. Love you. - Bye, Cheryl. - See ya, later, Brea. (CONGREGATION SINGS) (SINGING CONTINUES) Hey there. Hey. Are you all right? Yeah, I lost the words. Sorry. Nobody noticed, trust me. Hey, um... Did you ever go through, like, a... a doubting phase? Oh, sure. Don't most people? I don't think so. Oh... Well, yeah. I mean... I've had my questions. Did you get your answers? I guess I just realized that God is bigger than my questions. You know? But, um... what does that mean? Don't think so much. You're sure they didn't notice? Positive. Liar. Hey... Breathe. Hey... Do it. (DEEP INHALE, EXHALE) Good. Bye. I really like Dylan and Erin. Yeah. Yeah. I really do. Oh, hi. Hi. You're early. Yep. (BOTH NERVOUSLY CHUCKLE) Looks different in the dark. Hmm... Yep. Great, yes. So when you see it, take her hand. Let your hand know before your voice does, OK? Gorgeous. Now look around to make sure you're in the right place. Yeah, kinda like that. Good. - What's happened? - Where is He? Gimme that again. Where is He? Again. Where is He? Really ask it. Where is He? They've taken him. Someone must have taken him. But who? Oh, my Son... Why are you sad? Why the tears? Sorry. That's kind of... I'm still being kind of soldiery, aren't I? That's OK. Take it again... a little lighter. OK... Why are you sad? Why the tears? Because... Because they've taken... Yeah, I know the line. I'm sorry. Because they've taken Him... They've taken my Lord. Good, and then Ryan. Mother, Mary. Good. My Son. Make that a whisper. (WHISPERS) My Son. Again. My Son. Again. Look at him. Really look at him. Take a moment. Take a moment before you do it again. Let it sink in. Really feel the breaking of the silence. My Son. Jesus. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. Uh, there's not that many other opportunities... Yeah. (GROUP CHATTERING) (MUSIC SLOWLY BUILDS) (NO AUDIO) (MUSIC SLOWLY FADES) Oh, Brea, that was just wonderful! Just wonderful! I'm glad you liked it. Great job, Brea. Almost enough to make a believer outta me. The Lord is good, isn't He? He's risen indeed! Hey. Hey. So you seem like you're actually, like, probably a really good actress. Thanks. Not quite up to my level. Oh... But, um, yeah... You were really convincing. You were really good. Thanks. Yeah. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Hey, um... You know I'm not... stupid, right? What do you mean? I mean, like, I'm not dumb. I didn't say you were. I mean, I guess I just... I mean, I think about stuff, too, you know? I know. (CAR HORN HONKING) Bye. See ya. Hey, so, um... What's the deal with Mrs. Powell's granddaughter? Oh, gosh. She... Well, not much to say. They're just kind of inseparable. Hmm. Why? I don't know. I just find her kind of interesting, I guess. She is that. (BOTH LAUGHING) There you go. That's called a parentheses. - Hmm. - Yeah. Hey! What? Are you serious? Oh... Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! OK, all right! Yes! Woo! Woo!!! Yes, yes, yes! (KIDS SCREAMING, CHEERING) These women seem... not human. I know, right? Someone come tell me what to wear! Mom, come tell me what to wear. Is that the mail? - Shit! - Laura! I got in! I got my letter today! Did you get your letter today? I got my letter today and I got in. Call me back right now! It's Laura. How do I look? - What? - How do I look? You look good. Yeah, are you sure? Yeah, you look really good. Like... Cute? Cute? Yeah. Yeah... You look cute. Thanks. (PEOPLE CHATTERING, LAUGHING) - Hey. - Hey! Happy Birthday! Thanks! - Did you get my message? - Yeah. Did you get one, too? - Yeah. - Weeee! Hey, y'all! Happy birthday, sweetheart. Happy birthday, moviemaker. Sorry we're late, it was... It was both of our faults. Yeah, something like that. - Thanks for coming. - Yeah, absolutely. What? Oh, hey, Harry! How ya doin? Happy Birthday. Thanks, Austin. You're makin' me blush. Uh, excuse me, everybody! Can I have your attention, everybody? Um... I just want to thank everyone for comin' out to help celebrate my boy's birthday. He is so... special. He is so special to me, and I don't think he'll ever know how much. He helps me... so much. He's a good boy. Anyway, he's headin' to New York in the fall to be a big-time movie director. And I'm real glad for him, you know... And I know he'll have the beautiful Brea there with him. But I... I... I just hope they don't wanna keep him. Yeah, watch out for those Yankee women. (LAUGHTER) Anyway, I think that's all I have to say... All I can get through, anyway. Proud of myself for gettin' this far. OK, so... Let's pray, huh? If we all take hands. I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me? I... Since when is Tim your best friend? This isn't about Tim. - Yeah, right. - It's not. I honestly hadn't even decided for sure until this week. And then I just... I was tryin' to figure out the right time. (CRYING) - I'm sorry. - But why? I just feel like I wanna go on an adventure. I...wanna see the world. Weatherford would have been an adventure. I thought we were... goin' on an adventure. Laura. Didn't let your lady go first? No, I'm hungry. How are you, mister? Are you enjoying Charleston? Yeah... Yeah, we are. Ready for the big vote? Hmmm... You got a prediction? You're a goner. (LAUGHS) Ah... Hey... So, I got you a present, but I kinda wanted to give it to you in private... Oh, OK. - All right. - OK. The best that he can be at what he wants to do... And that's what I agree to. I think that wives in our positions... Happy birthday. Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh... Oh, my gosh... Do you like it? I love it... I love this. - I love it. - Yeah? Thank you. I... Good. I just... wanted to do somethin' special for you. - Wow, thank you. - You're welcome. You didn't have to do this. I know I didn't. Wow... I'm glad you like it. I do. I really like it. Thanks. Don't, uh... Don't forget the little people. (QUICK FOOTSTEPS) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) LITTLE GIRL: Wait up, Matthew! Oh, hey. Hello there. I was just lookin' for the bathroom. Oh, I think it's, um... Thanks. Hey, you know, we should... get together some time. Go and get coffee or something, maybe. - Yeah, sure totally. - Yeah? That'd be great. Maybe we could do a double date or something. Oh yeah, that sounds like a blast. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. You OK? Actually, could... Could you pray for me real quick? Um... Hey. Yeah, sure, totally. Maybe we could just duck in there. (KIDS TALKING) - Hey. - Hey. You OK? Yeah. Lotta people. Yeah. Happy birthday, man. Lord... I just ask that you whisper words of peace and comfort into your child Elizabeth's ears. Hold her close and help her to know that she's loved. In Your name I pray, Amen. Amen. Thank you. Sure... Sure. I should go. Yeah. OK, uh... OK. What? Yeah. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) Hey. Hey... How you doin'? Good. How are you? Good, good. You wanna? Hmmm. Hmmm? - Huh uh. - Huh uh? No. You sure? Uh huh. That would be... He could get his Masters in Dance. Hi. So how long have y'all been married? Goin' on about eight years. Wow, y'all were young! Were we? I mean, yeah. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I love marriage... If you know what I mean. Shall we? Mornin', guys. How we doin'? Hey, how are ya? Easy as pie. We'll do the service, I'll ask you and Erin to leave, and we'll vote. Sounds good. Easy... as... pie. You all right there, buddy? Relax, OK? You've got this. But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession. And through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing Him. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved, and among those who are perishing. To the one, a fragrance from death to death, and to the other, a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? For we are not peddlers of God's word, like so many. But in Christ we speak as persons of sincerity. As persons sent from God and standing in His presence. All right, before I call our business conference to order I'd just like to ask if Dylan and Erin wouldn't mind hittin' the road. (CHUCKLING) I thought they were great. I did too. Church members are a funny bunch. They like what they like. I really thought they were gonna go for 'em. Brea, you wanna do the blessing? You want to? Um, sure. Let's pray. Lord, we thank you for another Sunday in Your presence. We ask You to bless this food we're about to receive to the nourishment of our bodies. In Your name we pray, Amen. Amen. Great job. Oh, Ms. Powell forgot the pies today. I told her one of us would come pick 'em up. I'll go. Where's Cheryl? Oh, she's up in her room. I don't think I've ever been up there. It's a dump. Mind if I go up? Be my guest. She's in one of her moods, though. I'll leave y'all's pie right there. Whatcha readin'? This thing. Have a seat. Clear off a chair if you want. You here for the pie? Yep. Hey, um... I... I never knew you weren't a believer. - You come up here to witness to me? - No, I didn't come up here to witness to you. I just... came up to say, hey. And, honestly... I mean, like, what do you think happens when you die? I think you go wherever you were... before you were born. You go to where you were in 1722. That was a good year. Isn't it kind of sad, though? I mean, thinkin' about not seein' people after you die? I suppose it is. I mean, I've kind of been havin' my own, um... Thoughts. Yeah. Well, you know... Do somethin' with it. (OCEAN WAVES CRASHING) (CHILDREN TALKING) Get back here! Stop it, Tim. Sorry. So... Dad told me about you. He did? Yeah. Wow. I kinda hate it. Like... I mean... I really hate it. I mean, I think it's sick. Hey... I would have liked to tell him myself. I'm sorry. He asked. I didn't... - He asked? - Yes. He, uh... What? He found some stuff on your computer. I guess he was... Wow. Yeah, so, you're gonna need to give him some time. He's gonna need some time. How long? Well, quite a bit, I expect. He's 13 years old, son, what's he supposed to need? Brea, I need to get out... Um, out... badly. Let's, uh... What should we do? Yeah? You think we can get wine? Do you see anyone? Nope. - Happy Anniversary. - Happy Anniversary. (GLASSES CLINK) Mmm. Good, right? Yeah, very good. This is nice. (CAR RADIO PLAYS UPBEAT MUSIC) (CHUCKLING) Oh, wait. What? We have to swing by somewhere first.

It's OK. Oh, you're home. I'm home. Laura? April, hey... This is my cousin Patrick. Don't worry, he's not joining us. He's just droppin' me off. Yeah, don't worry. Hi. I wasn't worried. Hi. I'll text you. OK. You girls have fun. Is this OK? Yeah, um, it's cool. I hope it's not too greasy. Is it greasy? No, I like it. OK, well, whatever, I'll get a salad, it's fine. I wanna be a veterinarian, but I'm not sure if I wanna be the assistant yet or not. Because it depends on how much responsibility you want. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. So, I'm still looking into that, and everything. Well, that's cool. Yeah, I really like animals. All sorts of animals. That's good, that's good. I think I'd love it. So... What about you? Well, I mean, yeah, I wanna be in the ministry, and I wanna stay in my denomination too. But they have a big problem with the whole woman preacher idea. So, it kind of sucks. Yeah. I kinda get it, though. I mean... Women preachers always make me feel kind of funny. Why? That's stupid. I mean, what gives a woman any less... Don't call me stupid. Oh, no, no, no, no... I wasn't calling you stupid. Yes, you were. And I'm not, OK? OK. I'm sorry. I don't mean to get off on the wrong... I mean, if you just pick and choose what you like out of the Bible, then why is it even important? Why is it even holy? It's the Word of God. We have this amazing Word of God. I know it's complicated, and it's confusing, and it's weird, but it's the Word of God. We don't have to like it. But it either is, or it isn't. Otherwise, what does it mean? Yeah. Yeah. How's your salad? It's very, very good. Very good. - No greasy chicken today. - Great. How's your sandwich? Good. Sorry about that. No, it's fine. It's been a... crazy summer. Yeah. No, it's fine. I understand. - You're good. - Thanks. I'm actually sorta cool. Just... I believe you, you're good. Come on. Where is he? So what's the deal with your cousin? Oh, he's a dork. He goes to Weatherford, too. You'll see him around. He's been going for, like, seven years. It's pathetic. There he is. You're late! It was nice meeting you! I'll see you in a month, I guess. - All right. Bye. - Bye. - Nice to meet you, Laura. - You too. Patrick... Got a sec? Uh... Yeah... Yeah. So, the resumes for the Youth Minister position... Frankly, they suck. Wondering if you might want to take that on? Oh, wow. It would mean more pay, of course. OK. Well, just... Take your time, pray about it... And let me know. Cool? (SIGHS) (MUFFLED MOWER ENGINE HUMMING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) What church are y'all gonna go to? I don't know. We'll find one.

And there we have it. - Oh, you look good. - Thanks, Harry. Let's do this. This is why you're not wise men. OK! Are we ready? Let's do this! Uh, Harry... music! Let 'em in! Music good, Austin? Yeah, it's good. Thanks, Harry. - Good. - Sounds good. You know, if you ever wanted to get together sometime for lunch and talk about that Easter music, I'd be all for that. Oh, sure... Thanks. - It's never too soon. - No. Nope. Merry Christmas, my friend. - Merry Christmas, Harry. - Thank you. You're a good kid, Austin... You're a good kid. (NO AUDIO) I love you.
