(Terry) THAT'S RIGHT, AFGHANISTAN. MILLION-DOLLAR SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMEN SENT TO THE HILLS OF TORA BORA, THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM CIVILIZATION. ANYTHING I WANTED WAS A PHONE CALL AWAY. SO COULD SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL TO ME HOW I CAN BE IN THE MOS TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, AND NOT GET ONE DECENT SURVEILLANCE CAMERA? (Junior Oficer) I DON'T... (ChiZuru) IORI... I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD FINALLY MAKE IT. (Iori) I AM SO SORRY WE'RE LATE. CHIZURU, THIS IS MAI SHIRANUI. (Mai) IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO FINALLY MEET YOU. OH, I UNDERSTAND CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY THIS PAST YEAR. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN WE'VE HAD A FIGHTER QUITE SO DRIVEN. WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, I GUESS WE CAN BEGIN. TRUTH BE TOLD, I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. (Iori) WHAT'S GOING ON? WELL, THESE ARTIFACTS HAVE NEVER BEEN DISPLAYED LIKE THIS. WELL THEN, WHY RISK IT? IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN... TAKAO IWATA INSISTED. HE'S IN FINANCIAL CONTROL OF THE TOURNAMENT, AND IT'S NO SECRET HE LIKES TO SHOW OFF. I JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE SECURITY WE'VE PUT IN PLACE IS ADEQUATE. (Terry) DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT OUR CAMERAS? (Junior Oficer) I, UH, DON'T THINK SO, (Iori) THANK YOU. (Mai) WOW... LOOK AT YOU. THE WAY THEY TREAT YOU, YOU'D THINK YOU WERE THE KING OF FIGHTERS. I'VE BEEN RETIRED WAY TOO LONG. NO, I'VE BEEN INVITED BECAUSE I'M THE LAST OF THE YAGAMI CLAN. YOU NEVER TOLD ME WHY YOU RETIRED SO EARLY. IT'S COMPLICATED. WELL, YOU'RE A COMPLICATED GUY, IORI. I WOULDN'T EXPEC IT TO BE SIMPLE. ANOTHER TIME. PROMISE? I WILL. HEY, THAT'S NOT A PROMISE. I WILL. COME ON. (ChiZuru) I'M SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING, MR. IWATA. PLEASE, FOLLOW ME. (Iori) COME WITH ME. COME ON. BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE. (Iori) THERE THEY ARE, THE TREASURES OF THE CLANS. THESE MAKE THE KING OF FIGHTERS TOURNAMENT POSSIBLE. (Iori) YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT? NO, I DON'T. YOU HAVE MY FULL ATTENTION TONIGHT, I'M SORRY. SIT DOWN. WELL, THE SECRET... OF THE TREASURES ARE MEANT TO BE KEPT WITHIN THE CLANS. (Mai) OH. BUT I CAN TELL YOU A LITTLE. OKAY. THE YASAKANI NO MAGATAMA WAS CREATED BY MY ANCESTORS. ALMOST 2,000 YEARS AGO. AT THAT TIME, THE NECKLACE POSSESSED... THE ENERGY TO UNLOCK THE DOOR. IT'S THE KEY. THE YATA MIRROR IS THE DOOR... AND IT WAS THE YATA CLAN WHO FIRST CREATED THE MIRROR. CHIZURU IS THE LAS DESCENDANT OF THAT CLAN. AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENS UH, WHEN YOU DIRECT THE ENERGY OF THE NECKLACE INTO THE SHIELD? YOU UNLOCK THE PASSAGEWAY TO THE OTHER DIMENSION EXACTLY. BUT I STILL DON' UNDERSTAND. I MEAN... YOU HAVE A NECKLACE AND A MIRROR... IT'S NOT LOGICAL. HOW? OH, MISS LOGICAL, I FORGOT. IORI, WE'RE USING EARPIECES. I MEAN, HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN? LOOK, I KNOW I DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH, BUT THAT'S THE POINT. CHIZURU'S FATHER WAS A GENIUS, AND HE WAS ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE THE EXISTING ENERGY WAVES FROM THESE ARTIFACTS AND CONDENSE THEM INTO THE EARPIECES WE'RE USING TODAY. NOW, AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON, WE'RE ABLE TO... ENTER ANOTHER DIMENSION. WOW. I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY. WELL, WHA ABOUT THAT THIRD ONE? IT'S THE KUSANAGI SWORD... THE MOST IMPORTAN OF THE TREASURES. ONLY THE SWORD... CAN DEFEAT THE OROCHI. WHAT IS THAT? (Iori) THE OROCHI IS A SPIRIT, OR A DEMON, THAT WAS BANISHED TO THE DIMENSION 1800 YEARS AGO. LEGEND HAS IT PROMISING UNLIMITED POWER TO ANYONE THAT FREES IT, BUT HE WOULD HAVE TO POSSESS ALL THREE TREASURES TO DO SO. (Mai) WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE WAS FREED? THAT'S A LESSON FOR ANOTHER DAY, WHEN YOU'RE READY HOPEFULLY SOON. (GUARD) I'M LOOKING TO DO MORE I THINK I NEED TO (Terry) GO! GO, GO, GO, GO! LET'S GET A CLOSER LOOK, OKAY? WHAT? WHO IS THAT? COME ON. (Rugal) CHIZURU... HOW ARE YOU, RUGAL? (Guard) EXCUSE ME. (Rugal) PEEK-A-BOO. (Terry) GO! (Iori) CHIZURU... (Iori) SHE'S HURT BAD. (Mai) CHIZURU, LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME. (ChiZuru) WHERE'S RUGAL? (Mai) HE'S DOWN. DON'T WORRY, RELAX. (ChiZuru) THE RELICS... (ChiZuru) HE WANTS... BACK IN. (Iori) THE RELICS ARE... (Iori) CALL FOR HELP. (Mai) WE NEED AN AMBULANCE! (Mai) CALL 911! (Rugal) IORI! (Rugal) COME WITH ME. REMEMBER WHAT WAITS FOR US ON THE OTHER SIDE. I CAN'T, AND I CAN'T LET YOU EITHER. OKAY. MORE FOR ME THEN. (Rugal) WOULDN'T IT BE IRONIC IF I WAS TO KILL YOU NOW WITH THIS SWORD? (Terry) COME OU WITH YOUR HANDS UP! (Rugal) GOD... (Agent #1) STAY DOWN! HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD! (Terry) NO, GO, GO! IT'S THE OTHER GUY, IT'S THE OTHER GUY. (Rugal) THANKS FOR THE LESSON, CHIZURU. (Agent #1) NO WAY OUT. HE'S TRAPPED. (Terry) OKAY, ARE THERE ANY WINDOWS? (Terry) WAIT! BACK OFF! BACK OFF! (Iori) YOU'RE LETTING HIM GET AWAY! LET ME IN THERE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. (Terry) BACK OFF! (Iori) RUGAL... (Iori)... STOP! (Terry) GET ON THE GROUND! (Terry) WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? (Iori) HE DIDN' TAKE THE SWORD. (ChiZuru) THE SWORD IS A FAKE. (Mai) WHAT? RUGAL'S GOING BACK IN. PEOPLE WILL DIE IF YOU DON'T FIND THE REAL ONE. CHIZURU, IT'S JUST A GAME. NOT IF SOMEONE SUBMITS TO THE OROCHI. IT'LL... IT'LL TURN INTO A DEATH MATCH. FIND SAISYU KUSANAGI. WHEN YOU DO, YOU'LL FIND THE REAL SWORD. (ChiZuru) WITHOUT THE TRUE KUSANAGI SWORD, RUGAL CANNO FREE THE OROCHI, AND IF HE DID, HE WOULD BE UNSTOPPABLE. (Mai) I'LL TELL IORI. (ChiZuru) NO, YOU CAN'T. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. IORI SHOULD STAY OUT OF THIS. YOU MUST GO ALONE. ME? CHIZURU, I DON'T... I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. IORI CAN'T BE INVOLVED. YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME. PLEASE. EXCUSE ME. HI. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A PATIENT HERE, NAMED SAISYU KUSANAGI. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO HIM. (Berta) YOU WANT TO TALK TO SAISYU KUSANAGI? THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY. (Berta) MR. KUSANAGI... HASN'T RESPONDED TO ANYONE FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS. HE EATS, HE WALKS, HE SLEEPS, BUT THE LAST THING HE'LL DO IS TALK. HE LIVES IN HIS OWN LONELY WORLD. HAVE A NICE TALK. (Mai) THANK YOU. MR. KUSANAGI? (Mai) MR. KUSANAGI? (sighs) GOD... WHAT NOW? (Kyo) MAY I HELP YOU? I'M MAI... SHIRANUI. I CAME HERE LOOKING FOR MR. KUSANAGI, BUT I WASN'T AWARE OF HIS CONDITION. I'M HIS SON, KYO KUSANAGI. HIS SON?

WATER KNOWS HOW TO BENEFIT ALL THINGS WITHOUT STRIVING WITH THEM. IT STAYS IN PLACES LOATHED BY ALL MEN. THEREFORE, I COMES NEAR THE TAO. IN CHOOSING YOUR DWELLING, KNOW HOW TO KEEP TO THE GROUND. IN CULTIVATING YOUR MIND, KNOW HOW TO DIVE IN THE HIDDEN DEPTHS (Saisyu) GOOD. (Kyo) (V/O) WE MAKE A VESSEL FROM A LUMP OF CLAY IT IS THE EMPTY SPACE WITHIN THE VESSEL THAT MAKES IT USEFUL. WE MAKE DOORS AND WINDOWS FOR A ROOM, BUT IT IS THESE EMPTY SPACES THAT MAKE THE ROOM LIVABLE. THUS WHILE IT IS THE TANGIBLE HAS ADVANTAGES, IT IS THE INTANGIBLE THA MAKES IT USEFUL. (Birdsong) MAI.

HE'S NOT... ALL RIGHT. THE WAY THE STORY GOES, AS FAR AS I KNOW IT, IS THAT IT WAS ONE OF HIS ANCESTORS FROM THE YAGAMI CLAN WHO FIRS TRIED TO RELEASE THE OROCHI. HE WANTED TO BE THE KING OF FIGHTERS AND HARNESS ITS POWER. INSTEAD, IT CONSUMED HIM WITH A MURDEROUS RAGE. SO THE CLANS UNITED, AND ONE OF MY ANCESTORS KILLED HIM AND RETURNED THE OROCHI BACK TO ITS WORLD. SO THEY SAY. WELL, IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT STUFF? LISTEN, KYO, SOMEONE IS TRYING TO HARNESS THE OROCHI POWER, AND IF RUGAL SUCCEEDS, WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO STOP HIM. WHAT IS IT? DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND RUGAL? (Mai) WHY?

IT'S BEST TO BE LIKE WATER, WHICH BENEFITS THE THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. HOW DID YOU FIND ME HERE? WELL, I KNEW YOU'D BE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS. ARE YOU OKAY? I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAW IN THAT PLACE. MY FATHER WAS A MAN OF PEACE. ALL I SAW WAS EVIL. IT WASN' ALWAySTHAT WAy. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THERE? I DON'T KNOW, A PLACE WHERE I CAN BE ME. CAN'T YOU BE YOURSELF HERE? CAN YOU? YOU KNOW, ONE LOST SOUL CAN RECOGNIZE ANOTHER I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST AFTER THE SWORD. I'M LOOKING FOR A LOT OF THINGS. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I NEED YOUR HELP. WHY? BECAUSE MY LAS NAME IS KUSANAGI? NO, BECAUSE YOU ARE THE LAST KUSANAGI. I'M NOT WHO YOU WANT ME TO BE. MY FATHER WAS THE LAST OF THE CLAN, AND AND RUGAL DESTROYED ALL THAT. THE KUSANAGI CLAN IS OVER. I DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR FATHER WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. HE GAVE YOU THE NAME. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I CAN SUCCEED WHERE SAISYU FAILED? I REPAIR MOTORCYCLES, I'M NOT A HERO. KYO, I DON' KNOW WHAT YOU ARE. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU ARE. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL HAVE TO DISCOVER, BUT RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO STOP RUGAL, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT WITH OR WITHOUT YOU. YOU DID WHAT? LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE THINGS AFTER I SAW WHAT IT DID TO THE KUSANAGI KID, I HAD TO DO SOMETHING. (Mai) SO YOU USED CHIZURU'S LIST TO STEAL THEM FROM THE FIGHTERS? COME ON, WE'RE CIA, IT'S CALLED "CONFISCATE." CONFISCATE? I TRUSTED YOU WITH THAT. SHE TRUSTED ME. WHILE YOU'RE OU THERE GETTING ROMANTIC WITH THESE GUYS, I'M HERE TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THIS THING.

(ChiZuru) WE'VE NO TIME TO LOSE. RUGAL IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE POWERFUL, AND I'M AFRAID YOUR PLAN TO STOP HIM WON'T WORK. AH, THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER DIMENSION, RIGHT? NO, IT'S BECAUSE RUGAL IS CLOSE TO MERGING OUR TWO WORLDS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL... WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S KIND OF COOL... AH, HERE WE GO AGAIN. NO, YOU SEE... THESE DIMENSIONS... DIMENSIONS, SEE? I TOLD YOU THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE. (Scott) THESE DIMENSIONS EXIST IN WHAT COULD MORE ACCURATELY BE DESCRIBED AS A MULTIVERSE... OR PARALLEL UNIVERSE. YOU SEE, RUGAL WAS ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO AN EXACT REPLICA OF OUR PLANE OF EXISTENCE. THIS MEANS HE CAN USE A PORTAL TO FORCE FIGHTERS INTO THE TOURNAMENT. (Rugal) HEY... WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT. (Scott) SHE'S IN THERE. THIS IS ALL HAPPENING IN REAL-TIME. THIS IS AMAZING. YOU HAD THE SWORD THIS WHOLE TIME? IORI, NOT NOW. LOOK... YOU BARGE INTO MY LIFE AND DEMAND THE ONLY CONNECTION I HAD TO MY FATHER. DID YOU REALLY EXPEC ME JUST TO HAND IT OVER? IT'S HERE NOW, AND I'M READY TO GO IN. KYO, I'M SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FATHER, BUT YOU MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO LET YOUR ANGER GET THE BEST OF YOU. I KNOW. JUST, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. I WILL. I'M SORRY, IORI, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. YOU NEED ME. FIGHTING RUGAL WILL BE HARD ENOUGH. IF... IF YOU SUCCUMB TO THE OROCHl... WHICH IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THIS TIME. I'M STRONG ENOUGH. THEN USE YOUR STRENGTH TO DO THE RIGHT THING. PLEASE. I'M GOING IN THERE. YOU DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IN ORDERS. WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME I START. SHOW US HOW THESE THINGS WORK, SCOTTY. IORI, IF WE DON'T COME BACK... DESTROY EVERYTHING. (Mai) TERRY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M YOUR PARTNER. WHAT DO YOU THINK, I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE YOU? (Rugal) WELCOME TO MY HUMBLE... ABODE. CHIZURU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. FOR A WHILE THERE, I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT. ALL THIS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE KING OF FIGHTERS? I AM KING OF FIGHTERS. THEN WHY DON' YOU STOP ALL OF THIS AND COME BACK TO THE REAL WORLD? THIS WORLD IS ALL I NEED. HERE, I'M IMMORTAL. THIS ISN'T LIFE. THIS IS WHERE WE COME TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES AND LEARN, SO WE CAN BE BETTER IN THE REAL WORLD. WHEN MY WORLD EXPANDS AND MERGES WITH YOURS, THIS WILL BE THE REAL WORLD. I'LL BE KING OF EVERYTHING. I'M INVINCIBLE. YOU'RE NOT INVINCIBLE... NOT AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE SWORD. THE KUSANAGI SWORD? SAISYU WAS MY FATHER. KUSANAGI... WELL, WELL. THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL. IT'S OVER, RUGAL. OH, NO. NO. THE FUN HAS JUST BEGUN. (ChiZuru) KYO! YOU CAN DO THIS. (Scott) THEY GOT SEPARATED. KYO'S FIGHTING RUGAL ALONE. (Mai) OH, GOD... WHERE ARE YOU? (ChiZuru) HURRY, FIND THE OTHER TREASURE PIECES. DO YOU KNOW WHA THIS PLACE IS? THIS WAS YOUR FATHER'S FAVORITE LEVEL. (Rugal) IT WAS YOUR FATHER'S FAVORITE SETTING. HE TRIED TO KILL YOU, DIDN'T HE? (Kyo) NO, I WAS THE OROCHI. IT CONTROLLED HIM. IT MADE HIM DO THAT. MY FATHER WOULD NEVER HURT ME. MY FATHER LOVED ME! (Rugal) COME ON, THIS IS BORING. LET'S MIX IT UP A BIT. I DON'T KNOW... TOO VIOLENT. OOH, THAT'S A BIT BARBARIC, ISN'T IT? HEY, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT. BATTER UP. TERRY? TERRY... OH, MAN. MAYBE YOU DID TRAVEL TO ANOTHER DIMENSION. THRILLED YOU'RE ON BOARD. THIS MUST BE WHAT CHIZURU WAS TALKING ABOUT. THE WORLDS ARE MERGING. FIND A DOOR! (Announcer) NOW BATTLING, NUMBER 36, RUGAL! (Rugal) NICE SWORD YOU'VE GOT THERE. I'VE GOT TO GET MYSELF ONE OF THOSE! (Rugal) ENOUGH GAMES. (Rugal) AW, IORI, YOU'VE COME BACK! NOW THE REAL GAMES BEGIN. (Terry) MAI! WRONG DOOR, I THINK! (Mai) YOU THINK? (Announcer) ROUND ONE! RUGAL VERSUS IORI! (Announcer) READY, GO! (Terry) MAI! (Mai) LITTLE BUSY HERE. (Terry) OKAY, NOW! (Terry) MAI, LOOK OUT! (Mai) WHEW. TERRY? (Terry) ALL THESE DAMN DOORS. WHY ARE WE CHASING THEM? (Mai) THEY'LL LEAD US BACK TO HIM. JUST KEEP UP! (Terry) MAI, WAIT! (Terry) MAI! YOU'RE DEFENDING HIM? DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS... OR WHAT HE HAS DONE? THE HISTORY OF THE CLANS DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE. NOT CLAN HISTORY, HIS HISTORY WITH YOUR FATHER! THE PRECIOUS CHIZURU CALLED A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE CLANS. IORI, HE WAS JUS A NEWCOMER, BUT A YAGAMI, AND PROTECTOR ALONGSIDE YOUR FATHER, SAISYU. KNOW THIS... I FOUGHT THE BEST, AND WAS READY TO TAKE WHAT WAS RIGHTFULLY MINE, BUT SAISYU WOULDN' ALLOW IT, BECAUSE I HAD DONE WHAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD DARE DO, HARNESS THE POWER OF THE OROCHI... AND IF YOUR FATHER WASN'T GOING TO GIVE ME MY THRONE, THEN I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT! EVERYONE WAS AFRAID OF THE OROCHI, AFRAID OF ITS POWER, EXCEPT RUGAL. THE CLANS WERE NO MATCH FOR ME. AND IORI, WELL... HE JUS COULDN'T STAND LOSING. SO HE USED THE OROCHI. BUT HE COULDN' CONTROL IT. POOR GUY. AND IN A FIT OF RAGE, DESTROYED THE MIGHTY SAISYU KUSANAGI. WHAT DID YOU DO? IORI, NO! STOP HIDING, IORI. NOW YOU ARE FREE. WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME? HUH? I CAN' CONTROL IT! LET GO! (Mai) KYO! AAAGH! THIS IS NO FUN ANYMORE. (Kyo) YOU ALL RIGHT? (Mai) YEAH. IORI... YOU? (Rugal) SO TOUCHING. IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE TEAM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. (ChiZuru) NO SO FAST, RUGAL. (Rugal) CHIZURU. YOU'VE BEEN BUSY. AND I SEE YOU'VE BROUGHT TOYS. (ChiZuru) IT TOOK... SOME TIME, BUT WE FOUND THE REMAINING PIECES. YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TREASURES YOU DON'T. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE, RUGAL. (Rugal) BEFORE WHAT? (ChiZuru) KYO, RAISE YOUR SWORD. (ChiZuru) IORI! (Rugal) I'M TOO POWERFUL NOW. YOUR PRECIOUS TREASURES WON'T WORK ON ME! (Mai) RUGAL! (Rugal) IS THERE NO ONE HERE... (Rugal)... TO CHALLENGE ME! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? ALL THESE DAMN DOORS. SHIT. (Terry) OH, I GOT THIS. MAI? M... MAI! (Rugal) COME ON, IORI, COME FIGHT ME. (Iori) STOP, RUGAL. I KNOW WHA YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, AND IT WON'T WORK THIS TIME. (Kyo) I'M NO STRONG ENOUGH. (Iori) YOU HAVE TO BE. WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. (Kyo) WHAT IF I'M NOT? THEN WE ALL DIE. OH, GREAT PEP TALK. (ChiZuru) NO. MAI. OKAY. YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE. NO WAY OUT. DAMN IT. (ChiZuru) WE'RE TOO LATE. NO, I CAN DO THIS, OKAY? JUST SHOW ME HOW. I CAN'T DO I WITHOUT YOU LISTEN TO ME. THERE'S NO WAY BACK FOR ME. YOU KNOW THAT. I NEED YOU TO TAKE MY PLACE. WHO IS I YOU THINK I AM? I'M NOT YOU, OKAY? I CAN'T. I NEVER WILL BE. I DON'T NEED YOU TO BE ME. I NEED YOU TO BE YOU. (Rugal) YOU NEED ME! AAAAGH! (Rugal) IT'S ON, BABE. I'M GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN PLAYING WITH YOU. (Kyo) PLAY WITH THIS. (Rugal) I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET, KUSANAGI! (Rugal) HE TRIED TO KILL YOU, DIDN'T HE? (Rugal) I'M TOO POWERFUL NOW. (Rugal) NOT CLAN HISTORY, HIS HISTORY WITH YOUR FATHER! (Rugal) GET UP. (Terry) SO, WHA ARE YOU GOING TO DO? (Kyo) WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD KEEP UP WITH THE TRADITION. CONTINUE WITH THE TOURNAMENT. REALLY? WOW, CHIZURU WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. WELL, TECHNICALLY, WE COULD START IT TODAY. I MEAN, ALL I'D HAVE TO DO. IS JUST, UH, RECONFIGURE THE DATA... AND IF YOU GUYS STILL HAVE THE EARPIECES, WE CAN... HEY, GUYS, WHERE YOU GOING? W... WAIT! (Saisyu) MY SON... IT IS TIME TO FACE YOUR DESTINY. THIS JOURNEY HAS BROUGHT YOU TRUE FRIENDS. TRUST THEM. WATER KNOWS HOW TO BENEFIT ALL THINGS, WITHOUT STRIVING WITH THEM. IT STAYS IN PLACES LOATHED BY ALL MEN. THEREFORE, IT COMES NEAR THE TAO...
