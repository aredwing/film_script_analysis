So I pull him up and Kirby's fucking smacking... He's gone out to the woods. He said drive around, we fucking drove around. Sat there for about an hour and a half. Oh, fucking hell. Kirby's is coming out, fucking claret shirt. All over. "So what's up with you?" He said it was the oddest fucking mug he's had a gypsy fight with... It was a fucking an hour five minutes... At least, in flip-flops. Fuck, he could drive. MAN: Ow! He said he's fucking done and bust him up. He says, "I've, uh, handcuffed him. "To a tree." Brought him back. Two or three hours later. Fucking pitch dark. Only got them little torches they used to give you. Fucking not a sign, "Should we shout at him?" "What should we shout?" "Just shout 'Paki!'" Fucking nothing. Nah. He doesn't answer to "Paki!" So, I go, "Fuck you." It's like 2:00 now, we should have been off shift at 1:00. So let's fucking turn it in. And he said, "Thing is, they all look the same, don't they?" What, Pakis? No, trees. Psst, Jim! Ah, you scared me. You fucker. So... How's it coming along? All, good, yeah. Cuts right across the Balkans. The old Afghan war route. We're gonna need some more money, though. Excuse me? That's 100 grand you've got of me, you cunt. I'm not a bank, you know. You're gonna make so much more back, you know that? Should be up and running as early as next week, you're not gonna be complaining then. Well, I hope it's safe. What does it look like to you? Jim, I haven't got a clue. Worm. Turkish worm. Yeah? Solucan. Solucan? How do you like that? I think you should make sure your Uncle Akif doesn't find out. Or you'll put him out of business. He doesn't know, don't worry. I'm more worried about your people. They know nothing. Fewer people know about this, the better. Good. Okay? Yeah. We're all in the same boat. Fuck. Shit. Jim, I can't be seen here! Party's over, everyone. You get the fuck out of my house, please. Get the fuck out! Move! Thank you very much. Hey. Oh, I don't need this right now. Fuck off then. Hey, Keith? What's happened? I'm very sorry for your loss. If there's anything I can do. You could surely investigate. I know how it works. Another ethnic killing. Who cares? Right? I know. I'll try. Whatever Jim was doing, he didn't deserve to be butchered. We think it could have been two Albanian brothers. They're called the Kabashis. What are you gonna do? No idea. Hello, Mike. Do we know any Kabashis? No. Albanians? This something to do with that killing this afternoon? I want you to get all the intel you can get, ASAP. Fucking antsy. Stinks, doesn't it? Smells like shit, all right, give it a rest. So what's the skedge? We need to keep evolving if we're gonna stay on top. How's this evolving, love? Fucking wogs, aren't they? These ain't wogs, Keith. These are a new breed of criminal. Detective Sergeant Logan. He's big'un, ain't he, Keith? Want some pulling down, that one. What do you want? Turk by the name of Jim Dikman was murdered yesterday. We're not here to investigate that, so you can relax. But I do think we need to talk. About what? If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. The same way I did for Akif Dikman over the years. What are you saying exactly? What happened to Jim is not how it's done here. If people want to take over, they're gonna have to work with me. Do you understand me? We will come to an arrangement. Call that number on the top. You wanna ease up on the jokes, big fella? Hey, no bollocks? He's laughing. Good day, gents. But you don't... Right, you don't... You wouldn't suffer a cunt, like you don't treat someone like a cunt. You know. Like, you won't, like, put up with a cunt. You won't suffer a cunt gladly. Marty, Marty! Marty! Marty! You don't suffer a cunt. Marty! You don't treat... - Shut up! - Oi, hang on. Shut up, Keith! Do that trumpet thing. No! No way. Do that trumpet thing and then that's it. And then you be quiet. I'll make sure he's quiet. One trumpet! Listen, listen. One trumpet. I don't even know what he's saying. One trumpet... It's Chris, innit? I don't even know what he's talking about. It's fucking Chris that does the trumpet. The trumpet. It's more like an elephant. Hello, Michael. How's the drug squad treating you? You just moved to the top of that pile, Logan. He fucking hates me. You'd think that policemen like Michael Logan wouldn't exist. They exist because they're good at their job. They do good work and they become untouchable. But this isn't the '80s. If we don't stop scum like that now, we'll end up working for them. Why's Nick Taylor from the PSD sniffing around? Our arrest rates are high. Why don't they look at other departments? Corruption is something else. I see there's another Turk dead. Did you know him? Yeah. It was two bob. What have MIT got so far? They're looking into it maybe being a suicide. Suicide? I heard he was chopped up. But if he cut himself into pieces, what is he, a magician? Maybe it is your Turk, Akif, then. What, his own family? What you talking about? It's all getting a little messy, this lot, Michael. I'm worried about us being ineffective. You need to sever ties and nick him. I don't think it's a good idea, he's still useful for us out there. He controls a lot. Does RIPA mean anything to you, eh? He's not a legitimate source. Oh, and by the way, we've had a request come in from Vice. They want you on an op investigating the East European drug trade. What about task force? It'll be good to split you lot while the PSD are sniffing around. I'll go in and chat to him. Leave me in there for about 30 minutes. Don't think he'll get suspicious? I suppose he fucking will, but it's out of my hands, isn't it? Soon as you say you've done it, it's all right? Cheers, Martin. I'm not happy about it, but that's life. We can't get too close. But you did? That's why I'll be very surprised when you run in and first-aid the place. Right. CPS warrant will be here any minute. Cheers. Where's the big man? He's just in there. Akif? Any news on the murder? No, nothing. You heard anything? Like what? Police! Nobody move! You, on your feet. MICHAEL: What the fuck are you doing? Sit down, Michael! Calm down, Michael, it's out of our hands. Why you doing this? Come from above, mate. Couldn't risk telling you. You'd have told him. What's going on here? Don't worry, I'll sort it. Huh? Boys, look what I found. Shut up! Where was my half hour? That was five fucking minutes. Got bored. One, two, three! Have you started the Akif papers yet? Have you started on the Akif papers yet? Yes. We have placed the heroin behind the IC6's fridge. Don't fuck about. Oh, Chris. Fuck off. Hello? Yeah, I know it well. When? Okay. I'll see you then. Anything happening? No. Michael. Nice to see you. You heard the news then? Oh, yeah. What was the charges, then? Let's just say he'll be going away for a long time. Where's Big John? Thought he owned this place. Johnny's gone, man. Gone where? He needed some scenery changes. Right. Cheers, Michael. Cheers. It means "cheers." No cash will exchange hands at the moment. For now... You let me know if there's anything you want me to intercept. Occasionally things might get lost in transit. But eventually, I want a cut. Call it retainer, if you like. Okay. Let's see how it's gonna go. Yeah? Yeah. Thank you. May I? Mmm. Not bad. Like it? Yeah. On the house. For me? Yes, for you. Don't mind if I do. Where's John? Hmm? How long have those two been running the club? I don't know, I've only worked here a few weeks. Relax. Enjoy it, baby. Hey, mister. Can't go to sleep, you know. Hey! You want the same order as before, yes? Everything is okay, we're just using a different route. And it takes longer, that's all. Fine. Bye. Solucan. We're fucking money. Where's the way out? Sorry, I got lost. What are you doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's fine. Where's the way out? It's all right. I couldn't find the toilet, you understand? Get out. Michael. What are you doing all the way up here, man? I got lost, I was looking for the toilet. Come on, time to go. Come on, Michael, time to go, I said. Go on, get out. You're getting drunk, man. Why are you doing this to me? How'd you find the offices? Michael, it's time to go, please. Sorry. Ow! What's he doing here? Michael, sit down. What the fuck is he doing here? Knight? He's CSO-14. He's heading the Balkan op that you're on. You are joking. What's the problem, Michael? We fell out, you know what happened. That was years ago, it was cleared. This is shit. I'm moving to a new operation. Are you? I'm not sure how long for, but in the meantime... Paperwork. Please make sure everything is 100% because Taylor will be looking very closely at everything we do. But why are you being moved? I'm a good copper, Keith, and did a lot of work with the Turks. "Make sure paperwork's 100%." Morning all. Morning. I'm DI David Knight. And I'm with CSO-14. I'll be your new SAO on the operation called "Fazool." Now, according to stats, according to Home Office records, more than 4,000 trafficked girls are in the UK at any particular time. It's very difficult for us to get a conviction. Victims don't talk. And addresses don't match up. And we end up with very little to go on. So, luckily for us, these cells are moving into different areas of crime. Mainly drugs. Which makes it much easier to get a conviction. The target for us at the moment is a family of two brothers Rezar Kabashi and Nikolla Kabashi. According to Interpol they both served time in Albania for protection and violence. They joined the army in the late '90s. And then... Bang! After the conflict, asylum to the UK. They now run an Internet cafe in Queensway. I don't fucking believe they came here to run an Internet cafe. But they've been very careful up till now. We have intel to suggest that they're very heavy traffickers. And they're moving into drugs and taking over them areas. Which is why they ended up on our radar. Hopefully, their multitasking will be their undoing. Yeah? So I want you all to study them files closely, and carefully. Let's nail these pair of bastards. Come on, back on. Ten years, eh? Long time. I wish I would have been in touch sooner, but... You know, I've missed this. Me and you. Miss working with you. Having a laugh with the lads, a few beers after work. All over a stupid misunderstanding which happened years ago. You're a good copper though. Always have been. That's why we picked ya. You've changed your tune. Ah, don't get me wrong. I was angry and upset and that, but... I grew. I was right, though. We needed that information and I got it. No apology needed. Let's just move on. I'm not apologizing. See, that's always the one thing that always bothered me. You were supposed to have my back. We were supposed to look after each other. You crossed the line I crossed the line? I didn't cross the line, why would I cross the line? We both crossed the line together. Not like that. You spread a lot of lies about me. You could've fucked my career up. Why did you believe him and you didn't believe me? She was underaged, Dave. I didn't know that at the time, did I? Case got kicked out anyway. I didn't want it backfiring on me. Didn't mind it backfiring on me, though? You seem to be doing all right for yourself. That I am. Nobody told you. Me, head of Vice, European division. Nice house, lovely wife, living in Brussels. You see, I overcome. Anyway. Water under the bridge, and all that. Do you want another? It's my round. Same again, please, mate. Do you want another brandy? Yeah, quite, love. Ta. There's a whole unit set up at the station, an operation that I've been assigned to. You're our number-one target. And we'll be putting you under surveillance. We'll be tapping your phones, CCTV on the club. Watching you both round the clock. So I suggest you keep a low profile for the time being. Stop any big movements. What's happened, man? We'll use these from now on, okay? Okay. I'll be in touch. Can I help you with those? Ariana? Can I help you? No, I'm just leaving. Leave, then. Did I do that? I'll need to talk to you about what happened the other night. I'm a policeman. I can help you, if you can help me. Please. You have made things difficult for me now. Well, I can get you out of this situation. I need to know what you know about the new route, Solucan. They will kill my family. Please. I won't let that happen. My number is hidden as a barcode on the side. My name's Michael. Call me and I will help you. Been lookin' at this club. The capacities of 'em. Blue Eyes. How well do you know it? I used to know it when Big John Cook had it. So you haven't been down there lately then, no? Oh, I been to look. Sure, yeah. We're investigating it. What? Naughty, naughty. Go on. You can't kid a kidder. I know how it works. One for you, one for the team. Not sure what you mean. What sort of deal have you struck with the Albanians? Deal? Think you bought yourself a season ticket down here, haven't ya? For fuck's sake! All the shit we used to get up to back in the day? Relax. You can talk to me. I'm earning their trust. It's early days. Good. Well done, good work. We'll... We'll need to talk to their associates. We'll get as much background as we can. I'm working on it. Anything else? No. Okay, then I'll get to it. And one more thing. Report to me first with anything from now on, eh? No need to go to anyone else. Fancy a bevvy after work? I can't, I'm afraid. Too busy. Oh, here he comes. Looks a mess. The fifth Teletubby. Well, well, well, it's the Likely Lads. You never learn, will you, Taylor? What do you mean, Mike? Well you won't get much following me about. Apart from backache from sitting in this car all day with your bum-chum. We took a wrong turn, and we ended up in this shithole. Didn't we, John? That's right, guv. I'm sorry Michael, do you... Do you live here? Well if it's tea and biscuits you're after, I'm afraid I'm all out. But, maybe I'll return the compliment, and pay you a little visit sometime. Did you hear that, John? That sounds like a threat. Noted, sir. Good day, gents. See you round. Heads up, muppet! The fuck your playin' at? Calm down, mate. It's Martin. What you so touchy for? Fucking kid. Where you going? Lovers' tiff? Oh, fuck off, Taylor. Charming. you'll have to speak to me sooner or later. Cunt. His name is Spartak Bejko. He's what you might call a "creative accountant" for the brothers. Maybe he'll cooperate with us. Okay. You know best. Size of that. Nice place you've got here. What do you want? Don't be like that, Spartak. We're here to help. The Kabashis will be going down sooner or later. And when it comes, they will use you. If I talk to you, I'm dead. Where do you keep their financial records? It's a fucking waste of time. Don't be stupid, Spartak. You'll be going to prison for a very long time. I have nothing to say to either of you. Fucking talk. David. Fucking talk. David! Talk. David, let him go. Don't you fucking touch me! All right? Talk. Come on. David. David! He's losing consciousness, for fuck's sake! He's bluffing. Wants to talk. Don't ya? Eh? David! For fuck sake! You might be right, yeah. I think he stopped breathing. Great idea, this. Fucking great idea! Barely looks like an accountant, don't he? Call me. I know about Solucan. I put 100 grand for that fucking route, and I want it back. I think it's time we went to see the brothers, don't you? That was just unnecessary, all right? He's already shit-scared. He wasn't going to talk. You know that. I know that. Let's go. You gonna sort it? Yeah, I'll set it up, don't worry. Good lad. All right then. We done? - Yeah. - Lovely. Lovely speaking to you, Keith. Yeah, you too. Till half an hour, then? You all right? Mmm-hmm. What did he say? No threats. Nothing? No. You done work? Afraid not. Right. Just a pint, that's all. It's up to you, mate. Hello? Is this Michael? Ariana? They sold me. Sold you to who? Different man has locked me in a room. I don't know where I am. Can you see a window? Ariana, can you see a window? Yes. What can you see out there? A street? I'm at the window. I don't recognize anything! What can you see out there? Can you see shops? Cars? Uh-huh. Yes, some cars. The number plates of the cars, can you read them out to me, Ariana? Yes. Okay. "S-G-5 "6-L-N." Don't panic. Don't panic. I'll... I'll find you. Okay? I'll find you. Okay. 28-30-0, can you do me a reg check please? A quick reg check. Thank you. I won't be long. Lisa, I need to ask you a favor. I really need your help. I'll pay you whatever. Nikolla? Who are you? I'm Lisa, friend of Michael's. He brought you here. Don't worry, you're safe. I was forced to have sex with lots of men. If I didn't, I was beaten. That went on for four years. And then they put me in the office. Doing what? Stuff with girls, then drugs. They promised if I behaved they would send me back home. They would never have let you go, you know that? Can I use your phone, please? I'm afraid I can't let you make any calls. I need to call my family, they're not safe. You never thought about going to the police in all this time? I'm scared of the police. If you help Michael, I'm sure he'll help you. Can I use your phone, please? He's busy? Why you brought us down here? Man, I need to talk to Michael. It's been long. I phoned him. "Been long"? Why don't you talk English, you fucking monkey? I've got something for him. What is it? I want to talk to Michael. I can't trust you lot. Honestly, can't trust you Feds, man. "Feds"? "Feds" is fucking American. Are we in America? No, but... No, but you listen to me, you little cunt! Michael's busy, so you tell us and we'll tell him. I've got an address, open house, no security. All right, and what's there? Weed. Weed? Yeah. Is that fucking it? I mean kilos. They're just waiting for things to quieten down before they move in. How do you know there's no one there? I know. Davrav put it there for sure. Might be worth a look. Here. Write the address down there. I'll tell Michael he said what he said. No point, is there? Michael's busy. You sure? We offer them three months and we take 30%. We let them run the routes and then we renegotiate after that period. They can meet us tonight. Sounds like you got it sorted. I'll just... I'll sit back and wait till I'm needed, then, eh? We good? Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Yeah? Let's do it. Michael, long time no see ya, man. You brought a friend? Yes. This is my DI, David Knight. He's running the operation on you. I think it's best if we all have a chat. I've explained to David how we've been working so far. And now we want to work out something a bit more interesting. Hmm. Do you? We know how much you're moving across Europe. And we're willing to turn a blind eye to your drug routes for the next three months. Michael, you changed, man. What's this all about? It's about moving to the next stage. Call it a probation period if you like. And what do you get from it? A taste. I reckon 30% would cover it. 30%? You fucking joking? 30%? No man, no deal. Declined. I know about Solucan, Nikolla. I know how much money you're going to be raking in from that new route, alone. You need to keep me sweet. Don't worry, you'll be left completely alone to operate. We'll disappear. Isn't that right, David? Sorry? I've said if... They do what we want, we'll leave them well alone. I've no idea what you're talking about. The deal we've discussed. Didn't discuss anything with ya. Wait, wait, wait. Is this a fucking joke or what? That's not... What you doing, David? What you doing? I'm removing meself from this situation. Just for the record, I want to state that I had nothing to do with this. What the fuck are you playin' at? I'm not playing at anything. What, you're just backtracking... You just brought me into this place, right? This has got nothing to do with me. So everything we talked about has just gone right out the window? What did we talk about? Am I fucking dreaming? I'm your superior officer. I think you should respect me. Gettin' your own back on me, now, is that what it is? You're gettin' your own back on me, you're fucking me up! You're losin' the plot, soldier... I'm losin' the plot? You should sit down now! What the fuck you doin? I'm removing myself from the situation. David, what you doin' to me? You don't understand me. Get the fuck out of here! You fucking pig! Shut up, you, you fuckin' filthy Arab. Who d'you think you're talking to? I'm removing meself from this situation What the fuck are you playin' at? I'm not playing at anything. What, you just backtrack... You just brought me into this place, right? This has got nothing to do with me. So, everything we talked about has just gone right out the window? - What did we talk about? - Am I fucking dreaming? I'm your superior officer. I wish I would have been in touch sooner, but... You know, I've missed this. Me and you... You're a good copper, though. Always have been. That's why we picked ya. That's why we picked ya. That's why we picked ya. Well done, mate. Well, there's no cunt here. Here! Fucking come here! Oh, you're a fucking beauty? Is that a chimney full of gears? Aye. There's gotta be 20 boxes there. Easy, mate. Hmm? You know that Turk that was chopped up in a warehouse last week? Jim Dikman? He was one of Logan's associates. And guess who was the last person to see him alive? So he killed the Turk? He's a murderer? No, but the cunt's DNA will be all over the body - So we got the bastard? - Yeah. You're doing a good job, David. It'll make a huge difference. And you help me in this and that new stuff will disappear. You can go back to your nice life, nobody will know anything. I just want to get back, do you know what I mean? I just wanna get back to Brussels. I'll make sure that happens. - Thanks. - You have my word. Silly bastard thinks we're mates again. Hello, it's Martin's phone. Hello, this is Keith. I'm not here. Hi, it's Chris. I'm not in. Please leave a message. What I'm saying is Martin, is... He's not looking after us now, is he? Hung us all out to dry, ain't he, eh? He's me mate, Keith. Yeah? Why didn't you give him half your share, then? - Come on. - I'm not... Come on... I'm not done here. Fuck you. You shut up. I'll tell you what, though... Fuck Michael. Seriously. Fuck him. Come on. - No! - Shh! Ariana? I need to talk to you about the brothers. Ariana? She won't be any use for a while. I gave her Diazepam. Diazepam? She was freaking out. She needed to calm down. You can't go back to the flat. It's not safe. What you mean I can't go back to the flat? I really fucked up, Lisa. David Knight is dead. I was doing this deal with these Albanians and it all went wrong. Nearly killed me. And now I need to get to them before they get to me. David Knight's dead? Stabbed to death. Have you reported it? Michael, they've killed a policeman you've got to tell someone. I know. But I can't just yet. Knight was working with the PSD trying to set me up for a murder that I had nothing to do with. Oh! It's out of control, Michael. What about Martin? What about Keith? They're not answering their phones. Ariana has information that could put the Albanian away. I need you to keep her safe and look after her while I... Try and work out what to do next. Fuck the fucking money, Michael! What the fuck are we? No... I'll help you. After this it's over. Thanks. Get on the floor! Get on the floor! Get on the floor! Get his arms! Get off! Fucking don't... Taylor, you've fucking had it. Taylor, you're fucking dead. You cunt! I'm task force, mate. Task force. Guv. The Three Amigos have been nicked. Taylor's got 'em. Were you involved? We need to raid two locations ASAP. We need to move now. Waiting on a warrant... Can you ask the judge? On what charges? I can get 'em on Section 33A. All right. Where's Knight? He's gone AWOL. Oh, fuck. But it's Knight's fucking operation! We need to strike now. Okay, I'll call the judge. No more favors, Michael. Police! Give me your wrist! - On your feet! - Get up! On your feet! I'm arresting on suspicion of conspiracy to manage a brothel and human trafficking contrary to Sections 33A and 58 of the Sexual Offences Act of 2003. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand? Okay. - Go on! - Move! Come on! Move! I can help you. I think you know that. Want one of these? Yeah. There's no need to play the strong silent type. Time to look after number one now. No comment. Here! Fucking come here! Oh, you're a fucking beauty? Is that a chimney full of gears? I still don't get to fuck. There's gotta be 20 boxes there. Easy, mate. - Go on. - For the picking? I still don't get to fuck. He owns a... One of them. How do you know that? No comment. Spartak? Oh... Taylor's interrogating your crew as we speak, Michael. This is bad for all of us. You need to sort it. You need to do something, ASAP. Do you understand? Fucking cunt Taylor! All written down in the log. Every last detail. You kept a log of all the corruption for just this day. This one day. Michael can be a really scary individual when he needs to be. He bullied me. Michael bullied you, Keith? Oh, I have. I've got medical records from doctors. I've had depression and all sorts. I couldn't drive at one point. But Michael wasn't at the heist, was he? I'm going to be looking for some compensation after all I've been through. My nerves are in fucking tatters. Why don't you go and fuck yourself, Tintin? Oh... Come on now, Keith, you've had your fun. I know how you can get Logan. Oh, yeah? I need to be out of here first. So you're going to set him up then? Yeah, that's simple, right? I need to be out of here to make it happen. Fuck! Fuck! Is that you, Taylor? Call it a piece of insurance. I think we need to talk, don't we? Okay. I'll see you there, Michael. You watching me? Make sure you came dry-cleaned. Michael, all your crew's been nicked. Don't make it worse for yourself, just give me my fucking laptop. Michael? Lisa, how you doing? How's Ariana? No, she's fine. She's sleeping. When are you coming back? I'm getting things sorted. It'll be okay. I'll call you later. Michael. Michael! Fuck. Hello, Lisa? It's Martin. Listen to me. Michael's in trouble. I know. I know. Where are you? Is Michael there? Right. Give me the address. Listen. Calm down. I'm on my way. I've got an address for you. I want the cash first. Do you understand? I said I need the cash first or there's no deal. Okay. Let's meet. Shit. Get out. It's okay. Jesus! Jesus Christ. Get on your knees. What? Get down on your knees. Michael, what are we doing? This is... This is crazy. You know that Turk that was chopped up in the warehouse last week? Jim Dikman? He was one of Logan's associates. And guess who was the last person to see him alive? So he killed the Turk? He's a murderer? No. But the cunt's DNA will be all over the body. So we got the bastard? Yeah. You're doing a good job, David. It'll make a huge difference. And you help me in this and that new stuff will disappear. David, what you doin' to me? You don't understand me. Get the fuck out of here! You fucking pig! Shut up, you fucking filthy Arab! Who do you think you're talking to? Well, he won't be seeing Brussels again, that's for sure. Please, Michael. I've got a wife and kids. Good for you. Please... You do the right thing. It's not too late. Let me help you. Help me? I think you've done enough, don't you? You know how you can help me? You can start by explaining... Why you and David Knight were trying to frame me for the murder of Jim Dikman. Pick it up. Pick it up! No. Taylor, we're in the woods. I've got a gun in my hand. My name is... My name is Detective Inspector Nick Taylor. Michael Logan... Is guilty of corruption, theft... Extortion... Intimidating witnesses, bribery... So how does it feel? You want me to go on, huh? Coercion, assault... Fraud, and bloody fucking murder! Shut up! Guv? We need to raid the Kabashi shop now. Released? Fucking released? Are you fucking kidding me? What about Spartak? I found his fucking head! Guv, please. We need to do something now, please. Fuck's sake! What you looking at? Hello? Michael, why don't you get your friend Akif to help you now? Who do you think you are? You know there's 33,000 in my game, mate. The money you put into the Solucan was a wise investment, no? Shame. Shame you lost everything, Michael. You put us down for murder, we take you down. You put us down for drugs, we do the same, man. So let's end this, please. Fuck you. What the fuck? Michael. Michael? Lisa? It's Ariana. Where are you? Ariana? Why are you answering the phone? Where's Lisa? She's in the bathroom. Are you okay? Yes. I am better now. Where are you? I'm on my way. Can you put Lisa on? Okay, hold on. I'll get her. Michael, where are you? I won't be long. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. I was just in the toilet. I was calling. Are you sure? See you soon, yeah? Relax now.
