No. I wouldn't be surprised if she killed her brother. Considering. I mean, she looks like a killer. NO!!! No... None of this is your fault. Get these off of me. You gotta be quiet until your lawyer comes, okay? - A lawyer. - Shh... You better lock her up for this. She stole a gun from my house. Skylar was found with four bullet holes in his chest, a mile away from where you crashed. You did this! Please. Don't even start with that. You were there, Jake, you know it wasn't me. I know that you didn't kill Skylar. I know it. Okay, but you have to be very quiet... Were you drinking last night? Screw you, Jake, you know I was sober! Then why were you driving so erratically from the party? All I know is one minute, things were like any other party I've been to. Kids raging out. Loud music and booze. Harmless shit. I'm out on the porch. Been out there all of two minutes and I see this girl leaving the party. Upset. No, she wasn't carrying a gun. Jesus. What. Jake? What are you doing here? Sorry, Shelly. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. You freaked me out. Everything's fine. What are you doing sneaking around out here? I'm not sneaking around. I came for a noise complaint and I saw you out here on the road and I thought something was wrong. Oh. I'm here on standby. I'm Skylar's D.D. I'm not here by choice. I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. Underage drinking is major problem, Shelly. Now, it's my duty to... [NOISE] Did you hear that? You're not... you're not scared, are you? What, me? Who's scared. Ok. Just-- you-- stay here... Smooth. Sticking right here. [SPRAY PAINTING] [PARTY CHATTER] Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Boys, boys, boys, this right here is my inheritance. Wow, that is nice. Dude. Check that out. Take a swig of that right there. A little bit of moonshine. [MUMBLES AND LAUGHTER] These are so expensive. Put a little hair on your chest right there. Who's there? I knew you were scared. Jesus, Shelly, I told you to wait. Don't you listen to anyone? Hey man. Turn 'em. Turn 'em? Dude, these things are awesome. I can see clear as day through these. Damn right. We're all sorts of ready for the Chinese invasion. [LAUGHTER] Oh dude... Twelve O'clock. Oh, I see em. Yea. Got em? Got eyes? [GUNSHOT] Nice. Good call. Good call. You see somethin'? Got eyes. Got eyes for you. Where? MUSIC See? Told you that it was nothing. Hey. No, no, no, don't run. Stop! [BODY FALL] [SCREAM] Oh my God. Help! Hey man, I think I just heard your sister. Really? Yeah. Yeah, I did. You sure? Yeah. Shelly? [VOMIT] Dude, she drank way too much. Sh... Shelly... Get in the truck. Shelly, are you okay? No, I'm not okay. Get in the truck. We have to get out of here right now. Dude, she's totally off her face, man. If you stay here, you die. Get in the truck. Okay, let's just go, let's go. Come on! [TRUCK DOOR SLAMS] [TRUCK STARTS] Dude, what's going on? I don't know, I have no clue. Shelly, tell us what's going on. What happened? Dude, where are we going? Shelly! I have no clue, man. Shelly! [WHIMPERING] Oh my God. Shell, where are we going? Shelly. Shelly! Where are you taking us, Shelly? Pull over, Shelly. Shelly! [HITS TRUCK] Shut up! You need to slow down. Where are we going? Oh my god. I need somewhere safe. [HEAVY BREATHING] [CAR SLAMS ON BRAKES] No, please, no, no! Where did you get the unregistered hunting rifle? They're Gus and Jeremy Lambert's. You should be questioning the Lamberts, not her. It's time for you to go. Go... go... Jake, it's time for you to go! Go! That's it. Go. Come on. Right now. You go. Leave! [DOOR OPEN] [SOBBING] Get these off of me. [DOOR CLOSE] [SNIFFLE] I can't believe that we're burying you, Sky. You know they all think that I did it. But, I would never hurt you. It should be me in that casket, Sky. Not you. It should be me. We're gonna get you home and you're gonna get some sleep, okay? [SNIFFLE] MUSIC Jeremy, can I talk to you? I'll catch up with you. I know you still hold a lot of anger towards Shelly. And? Have you been drinking? What do you want? You can't keep blaming Shelly. Your family never quits. Not even when we're burying your nephew can you keep your God damned opinions to yourself! Jeremy, if you forgive her, the Lord will surely forgive you. Is that all? [MOTORCYCLE STARTS] [ENGINE RUMBLE] [ENGINE OFF] [DRAGGING ON CEMENT] [ENGINE STARTS] [ENGINE IDLE] [ENGINE OFF] [DOG PANTING] Hey, boy. It's you, again. You just can't learn to stay away, can you? [HEAVY WIND THROUGH STALKS] Hey. Jesus, Gus. Just got back in town. I wasn't expecting company. I was just around. You know, Shelly. You just need something, you can just knock. And Jeremy's not home. He's out on the combine. Besides, he ain't going nowhere with nobody after that party. Dead kids, guns missing, cops everywhere. I didn't mean it like that. Should never of happened. What should have never happened, Gus? You know... about Skyler. So you do know his name? He's not just some dead kid? Yeah, I know his name. I'm sorry. Who's upstairs, Gus? Nobody. I told you... Where are you going? I told you Jeremy's not here. What are you talking about? He's not here. What... What are you doing? You don't just barge into my house. Get your hands off of me! I'm not the, I'm not the, look, you gotta get out-- Get your hands off! [KICK GROIN] [GRAB RIFLE] You get outta here before I put a bullet in you! You don't scare me, Gus. I know she's upstairs. I saw her. [COCKS RIFLE] Another step and I'll put you right where you belong. Next to your brother. Try me. You are crazy. [POLICE SIRENS] Just like everyone says. You are crazy. [SIRENS CONTINUE] [CARS APPROACH] Well, there ya go. I got a trespasser right here! [RIFLE DOWN] [YANKS HANDCUFFS] Did you call my Aunt yet? No answer. Now, keep quiet until we come get you! I kept quiet all night. You have to call my aunt. [YANKS HANDCUFFS] Can I at least get some Advil? [LAUGHING] You can't just put innocent people in jail. Innocent? That's funny. [LAUGHTER] Oh, keep laughing. Karma's a bitch. You better get comfortable, Shelly. Breaking and entering. Good one. Thanks for that. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] What's her bail? Ten percent of the bail amount, which is... five hundred. Done. You sure you wanna do that? And you are? Her loan shark. Not a smart move, Buddy. Not smart at all. So, where do I sign? Right there. Let's get out of here. Seriously, I don't even know who you are. Well, you could find out or you could hang around here with these morons. [DOOR CLOSE] [CAR APPROACH] Nice ride. It's uh... you know, not exactly suited for Wisconsin winters. But, yeah. Yeah well, thank God it's still summer. So are you gonna tell me who you really are? I'm just some, uh, some dude who wanted to bail a crazy chick out of jail. Is that so hard to believe? Yes. It doesn't feel so good when people don't believe you, now does it? Well, for what's it worth, I don't think you're crazy. Who told you that I'm crazy? Really? Whatever, man. I don't give a shit. Yes, you do. Uh, no. You're twisting things. I'm not twisting things. You either killed you brother and your dad or you didn't. Whoa. You need to get your facts straight. My dad died in a hunting accident and I don't even know what happened to my brother yet. So, you need to stop accusing people that you don't even know. I'm not accusing you. I'm just... You're feisty. You think that's feisty? Want breakfast? [QUIET DINER] So, are you gonna... you gonna thank me for bailing you out? You know it cost me some dough. You can't buy my trust. Alright. Consider it a loan. I still don't see any reason why I should trust you. Do you trust anyone? Yeah... Animals. Oh, good. Part monkey. (CHUCKLES) Okay, besides animals... No one? Friends, Family? You know, I think it's my turn to start asking questions. Who the hell are you? Roy. And do you trust anyone, Roy? Myself. What about your parents? My parents' sole priorities are money and power. What really happened the other night at the party? What are you, some sort of narc they sent to try and get information out of me? No. I don't believe that. You obviously have some sort of agenda. Of course I do. Don't we all? I don't. Well then why are you here? You're the only person in this town I've never seen before. Not once. Do you even go to school? Nah, I've been... I've been kicked out a few. You know, we are a lot alike. You and me. We're truth warriors. We live in this podonk town with a bunch of dimwits... who don't want to know the truth. Trying to pin the unknown on you. And I know what they are trying to say that happened, really didn't happen. So, screw them. We... can figure this out. A huge part of me really wants to... ...but I know that'll never be good enough. You know, there's been times I've laid here for hours. Mmm-hmm. So this is where you bring all the girls. Hardly. I haven't actually brought anyone up here. Wh-- What? I haven't. Seriously. Do you think I have anything to talk about with the debontes in this town? [LAUGHTER] Oh, maybe not. Well, this is where I, um... I go to get away from my parents place. Which is often. I can't believe I grew up here and... ...I never even knew this place existed. Well, I've had a lot of alone time on my hands. Well, you picked a... ...a great spot to come clear your head. At least you can try. It just feels like whenever I... ...clear my head, it manages to fill... ...right back up again. Yeah, I hear you. Where do you go to get away from things? The river. What do you think about? Anything. Everything. Too much. I don't know, it's like you said. The more I try to clear my head, the cloudier it becomes. And then I get these really intense headaches where I can barely see straight, and lately, they've been happening a lot more than normal. I can't help but wonder if I'd be better off... I wonder if anyone would notice if I just never returned. A part of me thinks that... all those moving particles up there... it's just death and movement, like, there's a collective energy to it. That right there. That's it. It doesn't look like a bad place to be, does it? [Roy] No, I don't know. To me, it's just a bunch of uh... ...planetary weather patterns. Sure, it's pretty, like a snowflake, but... ...an afterlife in the sky? No. Yeah, absolutely. It could be. Sorry. But... I don't know, I've seen-- I've seen faces, hands, whole bodies, Dancing in the sky in some sort of deliberate supernatural harmony. Well, to me it looks like melting marshmallows. Makes me want a rice krispies treat. [LAUGHTER] What? I love rice krispy treats. Alright, we really should get going. The more time we spend here, the less likely we are to find Skylar. So, let's go find my dad's bike. Let's go. Okay. [CAR APPROACHING] [CAR PULLING UP] [ENGINE OFF] [DOOR CLOSE] That's him. [ROY] Definitely looks like a guy who would keep a little girl in his attic. [SHELLY] Yeah. I hate to think so but I really think it's true. He was on the hunting trip with my dad. They grew up hunting together... ...and he was on the exact same trip the day my dad was killed. I used to go in and out of that house with no problem. The first time I try to go in in a long time, and we've got a serious issue. Are you sure she's up there? The same exact girl that was there the day my brother was shot. It's so weird. It's like she knows I'm the only one who wants to help her. Hmm... I haven't told anyone yet because they are all just gonna to think that I'm crazy. But, I know that she knows something. Well, in all fairness, it does sound a little... Yeah, I know, I know. But, I just know that something isn't right. I also need to go in there to get some more bullets. I've got a really strong feeling that they were the exact same ones that were used to kill Skyler. [ATV PULLING UP] Shit. It's Jeremy. [RIFLE COCK] I know you're here! I don't think he's talking to us. What if it's the little girl? Maybe she's been trying to escape? You better come out before I have to come in a find you. I can hear you! [BARN DOOR CREAK OPEN] [CAR APPROACHES] [DISTANT CHATTER] It's Jake. Okay. Once he's gone, we gotta get out of here. Okay? Okay. [CHATTER CONTINUES...] Okay, go! [CAR DOOR OPEN] [CAR DOOR SLAM] [ENGINE SPUTTERS] Aw, shit! [ENGINE SPUTTERS] Does this happen a lot? No, not at all. Maybe the battery's shot. No, I doubt that. I'm popping the hood. [HOOD POPS OPEN] Um, do you have a screwdriver? No. How about a dime? Quick, Quick. [DOOR SLAM] This can't be happening... What are you doing? Okay. Try it now. Try it now. [CAR HOOD SHUT] [CAR STARTS] [MOTORCYCLE STARTS] Hey! [CAR SLOW APPROACH] [ENGINE OFF] [CAR DOOR CLOSE] [DOOR CREAKS AND OPENS] Oh, Shelly! Where have you been? They didn't call you? Who was supposed to call me? Unbelievable. Unbelievable is right. You can't just disappear like this. You have to stay in touch with me at all times. Whatever. I'm not some kid. Really, Shell? With everything that's going on? Imagine me here worried sick thinking the worst. We have to stay in constant contact, okay? Okay. I get it. Hello? Aunt Beth? Hi, I'm Shelly's boyfriend. Roy. Nice-- to meet you. (CHUCKLE) Nice to meet you. So, you're alright? I tried to reach you over a dozen times last night. My phone ran out of battery. Well, then charge it. Mmm hmm? Really, just figure out a way to stay in touch with me. Please. Okay, I will. Shelly and I are going to spend a lot of time together if that's alright with you. Uh, I don't see why not. As long as you make sure that she calls her Aunt. Deal. Okay, well, I'm pulling a double. I got the night shift. There's macaroni salad in the fridge. It's really delicious. So help yourself. Thank you, Ma'am. You have a great night. Ma'am? (CHUCKLE) I love you, Shell. I love you, too. Take the bag? Yeah. [ZIPPING UP BAG] Me and my dad, we used to ride this every Sunday. It's one hell of a bike. Yeah. So, you ready? Yea, I uh... ...I've been ready. Okay. Well... So, uh-- just-- hop on? Yeah. Just hop on. What's the matter? Oh, um, it's just I-- I... never... Oh, you're a first timer? Yeah, something like that. Okay. I know, I know. My parents are super risk adenturers, but... I make due. I make my own decisions. Ok, well, um, Don't be nervous. And hang on tight. [MOTORCYCLE STARTS] [DRIVING FAST] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [CORN STALKS MOVING] [THUNDER STRIKE] Alright. If anything happens, we meet back at the bike. Okay. [POWER BREAKER OFF] Alright. Okay. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [PULL LOCK OPEN] [WOOD CREAKS] Holy shit. Damn. [BODY FALL] Wait. Ok, Hold your breath. UGH! Oh, Jesus! Okay, the sting, it should subside soon. Damn it. We gotta just wrap it up, okay? God, this place is a hell hole. I'll go upstairs. Down that way, see if I can find the bullets, or anything, alright? Oh, come on. Damn it. [GUS SNORING] [DOOR SHAKE] Damn it. [METAL CRASH] [LAMP SWITCH CLICKS] [CAN FALLING] [GRAB RIFLE] [CLEARS THROAT] I know you're in here, you little shit. That's you, ain't it, Shelly? Come on out. Huh? Snooping around again? God Damn fool. Well, you ain't getting out this time. Uh, uh. That's for sure. [KICK] OH! UGH! [DOOR OPEN] [SCREEN DOOR OPEN] [COCK RIFLE] [GUN SHOT] [CAR APPROACHING] [SIREN] Jake! He's heading down the cornfield! [HEAVY BREATHING] [whispering] Hey, hey. I'm scared. Jake, she's here. [PHONE FLIP CLOSE] Please don't leave me again. You ain't getting out of here this time. God damn it. Lanuit! Lanuit! Eat your food! Oh, Rocky? Come here, pup. Come here, boy. Jeremy, is that you? What? Where the hell have you been? Pop, I've been out. I told you I was going out this morning. Going out? We-- we had a breech here tonight. Somebody broke into the house. Well, did you take care of it? No, I didn't take care of it. You come on over here. Sit on down. This is your mess. Pop, I'm gonna take care of it. Yeah, right. God damn it! [WIND THROUGH STALKS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Another day, another dollar, Rocky. Let's go get 'em, boy. C'mon. C'mon. Let's go. Let's go. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [WIND] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Shelly... Thank God you made it out. Thank God we made it out. That was insane! That guy wants you dead. He was-- he was ready to... I know. Because they know I'm onto them. You've got to be careful. Careful is not an option. Look, I know you want answers and I know you want them now, but we've gotta be smart. Look, Roy, I saw her in there. That same girl that was there the day my brother was killed and she has to know something. Who's gonna believe us? I mean, we're just gonna say we broke in and we saw her? I know. I know. We need hard evidence before we can get a search warrant on that place. We need to think this through. I've got the perfect place for that. Okay. Let's go there. Now. Oh my-- unbelievable. I know. You can see everything from up here. I thought we could map out our master plan from up here. Well, good call. You know, I've been here for five years and... ...I haven't made a single friend... until you. We have to find her. What? The little girl. We have to find her. Did you even listen to anything I just said? Of course I was listening to what you just said, but I obviously have other things on my mind too. You know, It's been a long night. Oh, no. Don't start with me, Roy. Not you, too. I was just saying that maybe we should get some sleep so we can make better decisions for tomorrow. I'm sick of people telling me what I need. Well, maybe you shouldn't be. Maybe you should respect the fact that I'm trying to help you. Oh, please. Shelly. You know what? There's no rest for the weary, Roy. [MOTORCYCLE RUNNING] [CAR PEEL OUT] [TIRES SCREECH] What do you mean you don't know where she is? What do you mean? I-- I've been looking all over for her. I don't know... Well, she's not here. Please find her. [CAR DRIVING FAST] [QUIET WIND] [BIRDS CHIRPING] I'm doing everything I can but nobody believes me. It's like I'm the only sane one and nobody gives a shit. [CAR APPROACHING] Surprised to see you. Figured I might find you here. Yeah, well. Skylar would have believed you. Yeah. He's the only one. You know, you should go. Go! I don't need you. Or anybody else. I can just... you know I can figure this out on my own. So, that's it, then? It's all about you. Look, you may think that you don't need me and-- and that's fine... ...but, what about the fact that I need you? Doesn't that mean anything to you? Of course it means something to me. [CRICKETS] Uh! Umph! What are you doing here? Oh, my God. Wait. No, you need help. Hey! Wait! Let me help you. Wait, I wanna help you. Hey! [LITTLE GIRL LAUGHS] [CAR DRIVING] Shelly! Sheesh. I've been looking all over for you. I woke up and you were gone. What happened? The little girl. I saw her. [ROY SCOFFS] No, I did, Roy. Seriously. She was right there in front of me. I was so close to her. Look, the best thing we can do right now is get you some rest. No, I can't just leave her out here. She's all by herself. You need to get in the car. You're running on fumes, okay? Let me take you home so you can get some rest. Okay. [CAR DRIVING] That's-- That's strange. Aunt Beth is usually still at work at this time. Why don't I come in with you? Oh... No, you don't have to do that. I insist. [CAR DOOR SHUT] [DOOR CREAK OPEN] Aunt Beth? Jesus, Shell! When was the last time you were here? The other day. With you. Aunt Beth are you home? Aunt Beth, where are you? Shell! Aunt Beth. No!... no. Aw, Jesus! Please, no, no, NO, NO, NO! Jesus. God. What the-- [SHELLY THROWS UP] Jesus. Shelly! [SHELLY LAUGHS] We need to get you out of here, Okay? No. We gotta go. No! Stop it, Roy. Stop. I can't. You can. We have to go. We have to call the police. No! Don't you dare! Are you kidding? We need to report this. No, do you know what they'll do to me? If we report it this? Who? The cops. Why would they do anything to you? [SOBBING] No, no, please don't be dead. Ok Shelly. You're not acting rationally. I'm gonna call. I'm going to call. No, do you want them to lock me up forever? No. Well, then we can't call. That's exactly what they do. That's exactly what they want and I know it. Ok... ok just-- just relax. No, no, no, no. Do not tell me to relax. Okay? We have to sort this out. We have to figure something out. Oh, God. Uh, we have to cover this up. We have to cover this up. Shelly, what? No! Yes. Roy, this is the only way. This is the ONLYway, okay? Okay. No. This is-- You don't know these people. Do you want them to lock me up? This is crazy. I can't. I can't do that. Roy, we are both in too deep. And you know it. Okay? Why do you think Jake was at Gus's house that night? They're all in on this. They killed my entire family. [HEAVY BREATHING] [OBJECT SPLASH IN WATER] MUSIC [GLASS CLINKS] [WRINGING RAG IN BUCKET] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [MORE KNOCKING] Oh, Shelly. Thank goodness. Hi, Mrs. Hellard. Hi. I'm really sorry about what happened with your brother. We're all praying for you. Thank you. I'm looking for Beth. She hasn't been at work the last couple nights... ...and she hasn't called or nothing. Is she here? Um, actually, I was just upstairs and I didn't see her. So, I don't think she's here. So... Shelly... What's going on? Everything's fine. You want me to have her give you a call when she gets home? Yeah. [DOOR SHUTS] [MUSIC THROUGH HEADPHONES] [WHACK!] [BODY FALL] [GUNSHOT] [MOTORCYCLE PASSING] [POLICE CAR REVERSE] [SIREN BEEPS] [MOTORCYCLE FADES OFF] [CAR DOOR SLAM] [CRICKETS] [KNOCKING] - Come on, Roy. [POLICE SIREN APPROACHING] [MORE KNOCKING] He's not here. You should know that. Jake. Surprise. What? Are you stalking me now? Dream on. Come on I have to take you in for questioning. The hell you do. I'm out on bail. And I've done nothing. That's questionable. What? Are you going to arrest me? Shelly, Beth's missing. What are you talking about? You don't seem very upset by that. I don't believe you. Are you gonna come with me by choice, or is this gonna be by force? MUSIC [CRICKETS] I told you. I haven't been home in almost a week. I find that hard to believe. The thing is... we spoke to Beth's coworker, Samantha Hillard. And she said she saw you at the house just two days ago. Acting strange. I've been with Roy Gainey since he bailed me out. And if you don't believe me, you can just ask him. That's kind of impossible, Shelly. Considering Roy Gainey is in the ICU down at St. Mark's. Shot in cold blood at his own home. Farmhand found him this afternoon hanging to his life by a thread. But, I'm guessing that is not a surprise to you. [whimpering] I have to get out of here. Not so fast. Jake, we both know how this works. You can't keep me here... ...unless you have proof that I belong here, which we both know-- Your paranoia and lack of cooperation could be considered evidence enough by a judge and jury. Oh, well "could" is not really gonna cut it. Where's Beth, Shelly? I really don't know. You do know. And as soon as I figure it out, I'm going to have you tried as an adult and thrown in prison for the rest of your life. - I don't know! I don't know where she is! I don't know! I don't know. And I need to get out of here now. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [DOOR CLOSE] [WATER LAPPING] Someone's gonna be real pissed at the airline. Oh, really. I hope this thing's full of money. [WATER SLOSHING] [ZIPPING OPEN] Oh! [BIRDS CHIRPING] Roy! We expected you to show up. Sir, I'm-- I know who you are. Is Roy okay? Don't talk. Just listen. Before you came around, Roy was doing just fine, minding his own business. And now all of a sudden this? And don't think we don't know about you... ...because we are well aware. I'm-- I'm sorry. Save it. He doesn't want to see you. Things just aren't well. I don't know. What? We haven't lost yet. It's just far from here. You're not making any sense. What part of "he doesn't want to see you" don't you understand? [BIRDS CHIRPING] [WATER RIPPLES] It's not your fault. Hey. They did this. Not you. You're following me. Wait! Where are your parents? I don't have parents. No, please wait. Let me help you. There you go. You need anything? Uh, no, thank you. That's fine. - Local authorities are still searching for ten year old Geneva resident, Ariel Baxter. Ariel was reported missing from her home in Geneva last December. Authorities are asking that if you have any tips, to call the number on the screen. Back to you, Steve. Nurse! Nurse. What can I do for you? Could you rewind that for me? Oh, no, the hospital doesn't have DVR. Damn it. I'm sorry. It's a pretty nice place, but it's not the Marriot. You got to unhook me. No, I'm gonna call your parents. They wanted to stay-- Do not call them! Look, I'm an adult and you will not call them. We got something. [PICTURE SNAP] [ENGINE STARTING] Roy! [MOTORCYCLE RUNNING] [ENGINES OFF] I'm so sorry, Shelly. You don't have to say anything, Roy. I do. You were right, Shelly. I saw the girl on the news. She's here. They must be keeping her here because of the murders. I know. I know. [WIND THROUGH CORN STALKS] Ok, small footprints. Anything? [sigh] There's nothing. Damn it. I really wish that girl said something to you while you were in the house. She's scared shitless. She's seen what those animals can do. I don't blame her. Wait... - Roy. - Huh? Did you hear that? Hear what? That. It's just the wind. It's the sound of a little girl's voice. We gotta go find it. Come on. Mr. and Mrs. Gainey. This girl should not be out on the loose. Putting all of our kids in danger. I promise you, Ma'am. We are working diligently on this. We couldn't do anything until we had-- Blood on your hands? Our best officers are out there searching... ...and it's a small town. When our son ran away from his last school in Milwaukee, we had a tracking app put on his phone. He is with her. [SIRENS AND CARS APPROACH] Shelly? Shelly, are you in there! [DOOR POUNDING] We're coming in! [SMASH DOOR OPEN] [CELL PHONE RINGS] Callahan. On my way. [CRICKETS] [WIND] Time is running out. I'm going back in there tonight with my dad's Glock .45. Shelly, I'm doing this with you. No, you're not. I don't want anything else to happen to you. - Mmmm. Too late. [RIFLE COCKS] Drop it. Drop it! [GUN FALLS] You two think you can keep snooping around my property and get away with it? You think you can keep on murdering people and get away with it? Well hey, now. There's only one murderer here and it ain't me. Oh, Shit. Shell, Shell, Shell. You really are a piece of work. Coming around here with all this crap. You really should be thrown in the loony bin. Just like your mom. Come on, take it easy with her. We are just trying to figure out-- You should really stay out of this. [THUD] Stop. Just don't, okay? What exactly are you two planning on doing in my house tonight anyway? I know she's in there, and I know you killed my brother. You've really lost it, Shell. [LAUGHTER] Enough with the "Shelly's crazy" bullshit. My Dad? My Aunt? Skylar? How could you do all these horrendous things? You wanted to destroy me? Get a grip! A grip... A fucking grip... Really, Jeremy? Look who's talking. I'd say I've handled everything pretty damn well, considering I risked everything to cover up the truth for you and you then you just choose to cut me off like I met nothing to you. Oh, I'm sorry. Your boy doesn't know. [LAUGHTER] Pretty boy didn't know. She murdered her father. Pushed him off the tree stand. Drove her own mom into the crazy house. That's not true. See? She's convinced herself that none of it ever happened. The girl is completely delusional. Maybe I should have never said I saw your dad fall. I just thought it was the only way I could save us. Guess I was wrong. What are you gonna do, Shell? You don't move until I tell you to, pretty boy. Is any of this true, Shelly? You just don't understand the rich family history we share. Shelly will always come back to me. Won't you, Shell? But let's get one thing straight. Once and for all. You're a cold blooded killer. You hear me, Shell? Hey! Hey. Watch out! [GUNSHOT] I-- I told you all. [GUNSHOT] [BODY HIT GROUND] You don't have to do this. [GUNSHOT] [BODY HITS GROUND] Now we can be together again. [CRICKETS] [HEAVY WIND THROUGH STALKS]
