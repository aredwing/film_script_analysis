Okuda Patisserie Thank you, uncle. I thought grandma wanted to be in the same grave as mom. How did you conduct her funeral? The union organized it for me. They rented a community hall nearby. Why didn't you tell me about her death? Grandma, she didn't like you. Is Hinako at school? She is studying for an exam. So she can go to college. Why aren't you in high school? Hinako Did I leave something? What do you mean? My bus pass. I gave it back to you on the bus. Here's your bus pass. "The Burning" I should have adopted both of you when your father died in the fire. You wouldn't have had to be apart... if I had convinced grandma. I'm so sorry. You make all of these? Uncle lost his taste buds. Really? Everyone knows about his loss of taste and still he has a patisserie. Do you know what "Brulee" means? It means "Singe". Not burn, singe Discarded desk burned A suspected case of arson Arson attacks continue Bikes set on fire Mailbox burned Arson suspected What are you doing? Hey, you're Hinako's sister, aren't you? - Are you skipping class again? - I already found a job. What is it? Fireman So, will you be a fireman, even though you know everything? Are you dating Hinako? Just old friends What is she like at school? Like, how many friends does she have orwhat kind of shops does she go to... after school or her favorite class or herfavorite movie... Why don't you ask her? What did you mean that I "know everything"? Do you always start fires with that cigarette lighter? Was it you who started that fire recently? I burned lots and lots of things... like someone's garbage bin, school uniform skirt, a pot of cyclamens... Flowers don't burn easily, they're too fresh. We burned lots of things together when we were young, didn't we? We were just playing! Was it? Burning our house? Burning dad? You have a cigarette lighter scar he made, don't you? He burned our hair, too. This scar is nothing. Don't worry, he's already dead. You don't need to start a fire. No need to set fires, anymore. Aren't you eating? I've had to use recipes and guesswork since I lost my taste. I don't even know if this tastes good or not. Since when? Since you've been looking after me? No So why? I can make a perfect cake for my customers without tasting it. Cakes are made by memories. All my memories, since I was born. If so, I can't make one... It's empty. I don't have any memories since I was separated from Minako. Let Minako help us. Why don't you two make up if you can't remember anything? I... Can I... stop lighting fires? I'll be... watching you. Thank you Welcome Can we have two of those? And two of those Thank you Hello, this is Okuda speaking. What? I got a phone call from your grandmother. It's impossible. She's dead. Are you OK? I'm fine. You escaped from the hospital, didn't you? There are no guarantees for you, if you break down again. I can't make Brulee without you. I'll be lighting fires... if Minako isn't with me. Let's go. Hurry up! Michinoku Kick Boxing Ex-kick boxer An ex-kick boxer? There are no jobs with a broken leg. Where are you going? To Maizuru. Give us a ride! Please Are we really staying here? Doesn't he have any money? Looks cold I'm hungry Please don't tell her... about my medication. This winter... will be my last. I can't survive... 'til spring-time. It's a malignant cerebral tumor. Maybe another month... ortwo. So I came to see her. It's a hard trip, but I'll go to the end. You haven't told her about your sickness? You should tell her. I'm scared This trip will be over if I tell her. I'm scared Discarded desk burned A suspected case of arson It's freezing. Your feet are cold. Do you regret the past? If we hadn't set fire to the house when we were young... we would never have been apart. I don't regret it. How about now? Don't do that, it's too cold. What will you do? It's up to Hinako... I've decided to stay with her. Hello It's me, Yamamoto. The police came to the school. They're looking for both of you. You burned the shop... and school, didn't you? I just realized... I only have your number in my mobile phone. You're my only friend. Where are you now? Tell me Hinako? What's wrong? We'll be arrested. The police are searching. Let's go I'll go on my own. We shouldn't stay together any longer. Don't run away by yourself! I lied! I told a lie to see you! I am here to staywith you! I want to tell you everything! I lost it... my mobile phone. It doesn't matter. We're better off without it. Attention! Begin! Connect hose! Connected! Hey! Try harder! Don't you want to be a fireman by spring? You can't put out fires. Hinako? This is Ikezawa speaking. Who are you? Hinako Okuda... I've got her mobile phone... and your's was the only number in it. Where is she now? You tell me Aren't you with her? She left yesterday. She ran away. What's going on? Go after them. Get to them before the police do. Arson, shoplifting... not paying the bill at a restaurant. We've done everything. We traveled a long way. The Bullet Train will depart at 6 A.M. from Hiroshima station. Did you check it? I checked the timetable. If we take that... we'll be in Kagoshima by lunch time. Do you remember... the house's address in Kagoshima? No, I don't. Don't you know? It's in my memories. The paddy fields, large sky and the smell of grass. Let's eat a boxed lunch tomorrow in the Bullet Train. Are you Yamamoto? Did you come on your motorbike? I need to bring them back. Do you promise to love her under any conditions... Yes, I do. Do you take herto have and to hold, from this dayforward... in sickness and in health, to love forever? Yes, I do promise. Let's make Brulee together... afterthis trip ends. Let's open a caf. There will be tables and chairs for dining... and let's put an orange curtain on the window. I looked at your scrapbook. I was in there. You found me... in every one of the articles. Even though I'm in the worst situation in my life... I'm OKwith you. I can do anything with Minako. The urn... to tell you the truth, it's mine. I won't survive until spring. I have cancer in my head. So, I don't have a future! I only have now, this moment! I've never even had a bad tooth. So, I came to see you with my urn. There's a restaurant overthere. I haven't got much money on me. Why don't you ride in my van with me? You can't bring the girls back with you on your motorbike. I don't need your help. I'll bring them back with me. Why did you let them go? You must know she is sick. She said she's scared. She can't tell her about her sickness 'cause she doesn't want them to be apart again. I can't trust you. I found you. If I knew... that I was sick... I shouldn't have... waited to see you, right? We are... both stubborn. Let's go home. You need to rest. It can't be cured. I know... about myself. What about the caf? I can't make brulee by myself! I'll start a fire again, if you aren't there! Let's run away... by morning. It's not finished yet. Please... come with me. Stay with me. Can I borrow your motorbike? In return, I'll lend you my van. Where to? I'll go back to the boxing ring. I changed my mind, because of the girls. Here it is. We're friends now. Whatever. Don't give up... you can make it. Shit. Do you have any dirty clothes? Hot! Minako Minako! Minako! What's wrong? Run! Get up! Don't go to sleep. Minako Minako Don't kill me off yet... not without permission. I'm comfortable... like this. Hinako Don't you remember? I started the fires... school fires... uncle's shop... all of them. I wanted to see Hinako too I started the fires No Why are you pretending to be a good girl? There's nothing... that we can't do. Let me become Hinako's baby. Give birth to me. Give birth... so that... I can be... carried... and fed... and held... ...all day long.
