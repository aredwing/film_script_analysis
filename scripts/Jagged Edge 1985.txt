Forrester, has been rushed to St. Paul's Clinic. The Times-Lofton publishing empire, founded by her grandfather in 1876.... - I'm District Attorney Krasny. - Yes, sir, Mr. Krasny. - What are you doing outside? - I needed air. You got a lot of headlines in there. It's a forced rear entry. Window at the back. We're upstairs. It's the maid. Consuela Martinez. And that's Page Forrester. Christ! We've got multiple stab wounds. The wounds are jagged. The blade must have a kind of serration. I'll know much more tomorrow. The cause of death is obvious. - Where was Forrester? - Over here. He comes in, he gets hit. He blacks out. He comes to and goes upstairs and finds them. - And saw what? - The bodies. - Where is he now? - St. Paul's Clinic. - Mr. Krasny, was she raped? - Is it a ritual killing? We have no comment. Do you have any leads? We have no comment. No sign of sperm. No evidence of any real sexual pattern... ...apart from the specific wounds we found on the wife. The knife used was a heavy blade... - ...six inches, with a serrated upper edge. - I'm betting a hunting knife. The rope you could buy at any Safeway. No prints were found, except Forrester's, his wife's and the maid's. The blood on Forrester's clothes was that of the wife but not the maid's. What about his head wound? No concussion, some bleeding. Blunt object. Come on, Hal, you know what I'm asking you. Possibly self-inflicted? Got it! Everything was in her name. The corporate stuff, personal, everything. She owned the guy. He was an employee, and you know what? He gets it all. Jack Forrester is the direct beneficiary... ...of all Page Forrester's corporate and personal assets. Do you really think he could've done that to his own wife? What the hell is "that"? You murder your wife to take all the money? "That" is the oldest crime in the world. Only you're real smart... ...so you make it look like some fucking Charlie Manson did it. You want people to say: "Do you think he could've done that to his own wife?" If I was gonna kill my wife, that's the way I'd do it. Mr. Forrester, why didn't you go out to the beach house with your wife? I had dinner at the Union Club and then I went back to the paper. - I checked on the Sunday editorials. - You don't write those yourself, do you? I didn't think editors wrote their own editorial. Sometimes they do. Did you write the ones about me? Yes. I insisted on writing all of those. Is that relevant here? - The editorials I wrote on Mr. Krasny? - I was just going to object. Objection sustained. I was just curious, that's all. Page was a woman of great generosity and compassion. I think the thing I'll miss about my sister the most... ...is her great sense of resolve. Page always did whatever she set out to do. I'll miss her more than I know how to say. Thank you. Nice service. Krasny. Now? He's gonna ride my ass into the Senate. He can't do that. You're innocent. The fuck he can't. You've been coming here for weeks now... ...putting the best apples on top of the barrel. I don't buy it! You say you were happy? You ever argue? Any problems? We've been over this and over this. And we're gonna go over it again, and again and again. Frank, there's no need to badger Mr. Forrester. Right, Counsellor? Mr. Forrester... ...I'm not trying to get you to admit you whacked your wife around every day... ...but I wanna know if you ever argued. I never said we didn't argue. - So, you argued. - What did you argue about? I told you, we had the usual arguments. - We were married! - Arnold needs to speak to you, sir. I thought you had the only perfect marriage in the state of California. That's fine, Mr. Fabrizi, but let's get back to the bit about the lockers. The club gives me a passkey, you know. So, I go through them. The members don't even know I've been in there. I've seen all their stuff. Their rubbers and everything. - That's when I saw it. - The knife? - Yeah, the knife. - When did you see it? When? It was right after New Year's last year. They like me to go in there at the start of the year and clean them out. Start the year off with clean assholes. Excuse me. They let you clean out private lockers? Sure, they trust me. I been workin' for them for 20 years. What kind of knife did you see? A hunting knife, about 6 inches long with a jag on the edge. How'd you know it was Forrester's locker? 'Cause it was numbered 122 and that's his number. Because right after I saw it, I thought to myself: "I didn't know Mr. Forrester was a hunter." It kind of made me feel good, you know... ...that he was a hunter, you know? Yeah. I know what you mean. - I'm getting tired of this, Andrew. - Look, admit it, she owned you. - I'm getting tired of this. - We're all getting tired of it. We've been doing this too long. I had no quarrel with the financial structure of the company. Do you hunt, Mr. Forrester? What? Have you ever been hunting? No. - Do you own a hunting knife? - No. What the fuck is going on? Have you ever been in possession of a hunting knife? No. I'm giving you a chance to cop a plea. You think I killed my wife? Prove it. You're under arrest for the murders of Page Forrester and Consuela Martinez. Frank, read him his rights. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right... ...anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Mr. Forrester is the editor of the "San Francisco Times..." ...and president of Times-Lofton Publishing. He is, however, charged with two capital offence felonies. But, your Honour, the charges are based purely on circumstantial evidence. Mr. Forrester has no prior criminal record. I don't expect him to flee the jurisdiction. Fine. The set bail of $500,000 will stand. I made some calls back east. I'll get you a heavy hitter. I don't want anyone from out of town. I don't want to contribute to the goddamn circus. Your firm has got to handle it. We're corporate lawyers. We can barely handle a hearing. - Jack, you got something for us? - What do you think? I'm innocent. That's all I can say. - What do you think of Krasny? - No further comment. Come on! Isn't this related to the Senate race? No further comment. My paper has been critical of Mr. Krasny's conduct as district attorney. That's no secret. He's an ambitious guy. He's got big political aspirations... ...so you can draw your own conclusions. Excuse me. No comments at this time. Please, folks. This will be a show trial, for God's sake. We've only one person who's had any criminal experience. - Who is he? - She. And she hasn't practised criminal law for four years. Jack, give us a -- - Is she any good? - Yes, she was a very good prosecutor. She worked for Krasny. Well. Teddy, are you familiar with the Forrester case? I go out of my way not to be familiar with criminal cases. Mr. Forrester wishes to speak to you about representing him. I'm in the middle of a case, Andrew. I think it can wait, don't you, Andrew? Oh, yes. Teddy -- Nothing in the world will make me go back to criminal work, Andrew. You know the decision I made. There is nothing in the world I'd like less than to lose Jack Forrester as a client. Teddy, you know the affection I've always had for you. Nothing would please me more... ...than one day being able to speak to you as one of my partners. Please, do an old man a personal kindness. Speak to him. Who lives here anyway, Joe Montana? I told you. A guy called Jack Forrester. He killed his wife. I saw it on TV. He allegedly killed his wife. That means he's gonna get away with it. So, how do I look? Weird. - Good morning, madam. - 'Morning. Mr. Forrester is expecting you. No, I agree Carl, but the murders happened over two months ago... ...and there's no leads because Krasny's locked into me. Excuse me, I'll be right with you. I'll tell you guys what I'm gonna do at the meeting. All right, I've gotta go. I'll be home all evening, so if you need me you can catch me here. All right, 'bye. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm glad you came. - Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. We met at a party five or six years ago. You probably don't remember. You said you like horses. Very much. Come on. - Andrew spoke to you? - Yes, he did. And? And the problem is, I just don't do criminal work anymore. Yes, I know, he told me. I was hoping you'd reconsider. I didn't kill my wife. - I didn't ask you if you did. - If you represented me, you would. I'd ask about the case they had against you. I'd want to win my case. Did you win all your cases when you were a prosecutor? Yes, I won every one. Is that why you wanted me to represent you? Yes, and because you're a woman and because you're good. You know what Krasny's capable of. Thanks, Karen. All right, let's show her what you got. Come on! I love this beauty. He was Page's pride and joy. Isn't he beautiful? The oldest equine species. The most beautiful... ...perfectly tempered... "It makes men imperious to sit on a horse." Oliver Wendell Holmes, right? Well, he was wrong. Look at his legs. Shows how vulnerable we all are. What's with this lead on Krasny we're running Sunday? It's a profile. Reviews his career, Iooks at the Senate race. The Senate race is nine months away! - I just thought now would be -- - Look, folks! I don't want any slant, any bias on our coverage of my case or of Krasny. You hear me? I've put my nuts into this paper for 15 years. I want objective coverage. I'll be taking a leave of absence until my trial's over. Carl's gonna be running things. I'm gonna miss you. Thank you. You know how much I'm gonna miss these goddamn machines? - Good evening, Mrs. Barnes. - Good evening. - Is Mr. Barnes here? - Yes, right over there. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. We went to the zoo. David's been after me for weeks. Damn! I was gonna take him to the zoo next weekend. Oh, well, we'll just do something else. Starving. Did I hear something about you and the Forrester case? You heard wrong. Matthew, remember Tom Krasny? May l? I think you should take the case. - Think of the fun we'll have. - It wouldn't be any fun. Maybe you're right. Too bad about Styles. What? Don't you remember Henry Styles? He's dead. What? I'm sorry. You didn't know. He hanged himself. When? Day before yesterday. I don't know how you figure it. Teddy and I send this guy to the joint four years ago. He's halfway to his parole hearing, and he hangs himself. You take care. Good night. When's Bridget gonna be back? Bridget is coming back tomorrow. - What's for dinner? - What do you want? I'll cook you anything. - Oh, God, Mum. You can't cook. - Either can Bridget. Yes she can. I thought you liked Bridget. She farts too much. So do you. At least not atom bombs. - Did you finish your homework? - Yes. Was Dad here last night? He was? Why didn't he wake us? He kissed you when you were asleep. - 'Bye, Mum. - Bye-bye, honey. David. David! Can I have my kiss? Tell him to wake me next time. I will. 'Bye, Mum. Have a good day. Mrs. Styles. You have no place here. Just a goddamn minute! Yes? Christ. You look like a real broad. Come over here. It's good to see you. Come on in. Oh, yes. Teddy, I'm a busted tyre for Christ's sake. My lungs are shot. I can't even piss straight. You were the best investigator the DA's office ever had. - That was a long time ago. - Four years! I know the fuck how long ago it was. Henry Styles. Dumb fucking asshole. He hanged himself. - I know. - I know you know. You're here, aren't you? Forrester isn't Styles, right? Let's say the bastard didn't do it. You're never gonna get him off. If he didn't do it, I'll get him off. Stop the horseshit, Teddy. Look, I don't give a flying fuck how much money he's got. A rich guy like Forrester... Where the hell's he going to find a jury of his peers? He'll get a lot of people who hate him for what he's got. If he didn't do it... ...I'll get him off. Forget Styles, will you? Forget him! You're going to eat yourself alive with all that guilt. I can't forget him, and neither can you. The fuck I can't! - Sam, I'm responsible and so are you. - Like hell I am! Tom Krasny is responsible! And fuck Styles and fuck you and your goddamned guilt! I'll take the case on one condition: If you lie to me, or if I think you're guilty, I'll drop out. That's not professional, and you know it. It's not a problem. I'm not going to lie to you. Okay. I want Sam to have access to all your personal and corporate correspondence. Your financial records, your wife's records... - ...everything. Absolute access. - You got it. We've got four months to the trial. I don't want you out in public. I don't want pictures of you in the paper. Look as if your life's been shattered. My life has been shattered. I don't want any visible support from the firm, unless I ask for it. I want to defend him alone. Not with a team of high-priced lawyers. The jury will like that. I like her. Yeah? She pisses me off. Nice to meet you. I'm very happy. See you tomorrow. - Andrew? - Be back in a moment. - What do you think? - What the fuck do I know? Did your mother ever wash your mouth out with soap? Yeah. But it didn't do any fucking good. What if he passes the polygraph? How will you know if he's lying? I'll know. Teddy, a guy like him, you never know. I'm representing Jack Forrester. Is he finally going to cop a plea? Go ahead, I'm a reasonable man. I'll listen. I don't want any problems with discovery. I don't know what you're talking about. If you hold anything back on me I'm going to bust your ass wide open. You talk to corporate clients this way? I mean it, Tom. "It's unprofessional conduct for a prosecutor to fail to disclose... - "...to the defence at the -- " - I know the words. I'm not going to let it happen again. You prosecuted the Styles case with me, and you did a good job. The jury found him guilty. He had a rap sheet as long as my dick. I'm going to nail you to the wall. I'll see you in court, Counsellor. Consuela's door was open. What did you see? Blood. I ran to our room. Was the door closed? No. Open it. - I can't -- - What did you see? That word on the wall... ...and the rope. Her hands and her feet were tied. There was blood all around her breasts and all over the bed. She didn't have any clothes on. All between her legs, the blood! Oh, God! How did you meet her? We met at Stanford. We met at this party. I didn't even know her name. I'm glad I didn't. I never would've had the nerve to talk to her. A couple of years later, we ran into each other at the country club. I wasn't a member, but I used to... ...go in and use their pool every once in a while. Then we got married. I started working for the paper. I used to... ...bring coffee around to everybody. I hated that shit. I worked in Advertising Circulation. Got to know everything about the company. Her father liked me. Why didn't you ever have any children? That was the biggest mistake we ever made. Were you faithful to her? You know how many times Krasny asked me that? Yes, I was faithful to her. Except for a short period a long time ago. It wasn't even an affair. It was like a series of one-night stands. The girl went back to France. It didn't even last a month. You'll have to tell me all about her. I'll send you all the details, times, dates, restaurants. Do you want the motel room numbers? I may have forgotten those. You're divorced, aren't you? Yeah. Were you faithful to him? Really? Really. - Was she faithful to you? - Yeah, as far as I know. What does that mean? It means, as far as I know. I didn't kill her. I know you didn't. No, you don't. You just want to get closer to have a better look. - What are you doing, Mum? - Homework, nothing much. I could sure use a hug, though. - You're such a good hugger! - Really? Really. Mum? What? Do you ever... Do you ever think about boys and all that stuff? Sometimes. Do you ever think about it with Dad? Sometimes. - Mum? - What? I liked it when Dad was here the other night. I miss him, Mum. - Give me the bottom line, Dan. - The bottom line? A straight, solid graph. The machine loves him. He's telling the truth. Or he's the kind of ice cube even the machine can't melt. Is he psychopathic? No, but he's manipulative. He didn't get where he is without being manipulative. Neither did l, neither did you. But did he do that bloodbath? I don't know. But if you're asking me whether I think he's capable of doing that... I saw nothing that would lead me to that conclusion. Sam, come on in. Thank you, doctor. I'll call you later. All right. I've got 832 pages, signed, sealed and delivered... ...by Thomas Krasny, Esq. The People versus John C. Forrester. It really took Krasny two months to put this together? Christ's sake, he's got him tied to that fucking knife. No, he doesn't. He has a janitor who claims to have seen a knife in a locker. - The next best thing, isn't it? - Nope. lt's not good enough. It's circumstantial. Krasny doesn't have the knife that killed Forrester's wife. The janitor isn't identifying it. What about this friend of his wife's? This Virginia Howell? It's hearsay coming from one witness. Kathy, would you get Mr. Forrester on the phone for me, please? Thank you. Krasny's too smart. He's holding something back, that son of a bitch. He's got to have more. Teddy, I gotta tell you. I've been watching this guy for months now. Do you wanna know what I think? - What I really think? - What do you think? He killed her. Hi. He's got a witness who saw a hunting knife... ...in your locker at the country club. I figured something like that. It's complete bullshit. May I use your phone? He described it. Said it was 6 inches long and -- I never had any kind of knife in my locker. Why would he be lying? All I can tell you is, it never happened. Did you always want to be a lawyer? I always wanted to be a prosecutor. My dad was a cop. What'd I get myself into? You want some more of this? No. You're a very pretty lady. Now she thinks, maybe he did do it. It sounds like he's coming on to me. You like to play games, don't you? Racquetball. I play every day. I used to play, years ago. We should play. You still look in shape. I don't play games with my clients. Yeah, you do. Tell me about Virginia Howell. She's a real bitch. She says your wife told her she was going to divorce you. - We can blow her out of the water. - How? - Coffee? - Yeah. When you come back, I want to know exactly how. When I come back, I'll tell you exactly how. Hello, Mr. Fabrizi? Teddy Barnes. How do you know it was this locker? 'Cause right after I saw it, I put it together that it was Mr. Forrester's... ...and it stuck in my head that he had it. Is there any possibility that it wasn't this locker? Lady, listen. I like Mr. Forrester. I wish I'd never seen the damned thing. Now, you ask me if I think Mr. Forrester killed his wife. I say, "No way Mr. Forrester would ever do a thing like that." But, you ask me if the knife I saw was in the locker here, I say: "Hell, yes. The son of a bitch was right up there!" I'm telling you now. I see this trial degenerating... ...and I'll hit you like a freight train roaring down the High Sierra. We've got a man's life at stake here. Not headlines, not careers. Do you have anything you want to share with me? - No, your Honour. - Yes, your Honour. I'm not satisfied that the prosecution is complying with its discovery obligations. I have complied, your Honour. Do you have any evidence Mr. Krasny has not complied? No, your Honour. Then, what do you base your allegation on? On my past association with Mr. Krasny, your Honour. Cite the case. I held something back? Cite the case, Teddy. I hope I don't have to say this to you again, Mrs. Barnes... ...but you don't question ethics in my chamber... ...unless you have the evidence to support you. Thank you, your Honour. Yes, your Honour. Why didn't you cite the case, Teddy? You could've gotten disbarred before the trial. - Do you realise how much I admired you? - It never got me anywhere with you. What about Forrester? Do you like him any better? Yes. I like him a lot better. Why don't you cite the case? Put it all on the line. The People versus Henry Styles. Case Number 26022. You got me! Come on. You can catch me. Watch out! You can do it! I'm not sure I want to. Yes, you do. Come on! See? lt's a cinch! Hey, where are you going? I'm getting you now! - You ride very well. - Thank you. That was wonderful. I loved it. You're not going anywhere. You left your lights on. I'll get a jumper. Why don't you just take me home? The first time I saw you... ...I wondered. You did too, didn't you? No. You liar. Dad? David. Sorry. Good night. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. You got another one of these crank letters today. - Hello. - Hi, Teddy. David called from school. He was a little upset. Come on, Matthew, nothing happened. That's not what David says. It's so difficult. lf I like someone, I'd like to be able to invite him home. I'll talk to David when they come this weekend, man-to-man. Thanks". '"Bye. - Hi. - Hi. I got another one. Are all the t's slightly raised? I had the last one analysed. He told me it was typed on a 1942 Corona. It's a big help, isn't it? How are you doing with the knife? I'm striking out, that's how I'm doing. How are you doing with our killer? - I like him. - You like him. He wants you to like him. The more you like him, the harder you'll try to defend him. I know that, Sam. I'm just reminding you, sweetheart! I can't. - I can't. - Yes, you can. I'm at a friend's house. Jen, I gotta go. Okay. I love you too. Bye-bye. I make a great Denver omelette. I have to go. I know. Look, I hope you don't think... It's okay, Teddy. It really is. I want you to stick close to me in court tomorrow. I think you should help me carry my things. We might as well take advantage of the fact that a woman is defending you. The jury's going to be watching every move that we make. Body language is really -- Wear a blue suit. Juries like blue suits. Anything else? Jack, this way! Any new developments in the case? Hear ye, hear ye. The Superior Court for the County of San Francisco is now in session. The Honourable Clark Carrigan presiding. The facts in this case are simple. The People will prove that on the night of June 12 of this year... ...the defendant, John C. Forrester... ...brutally murdered his wife and his wife's maid. The murders were in cold blood with malice aforethought. And he did it out of lust and greed. His greed for money and his lust for power. Finally, the People will prove that John C. Forrester was, in fact, living a lie. That behind the facade of all the dinners... ...and all the charity events he and his wife attended... ...their marriage was crumbling. The People will prove that had Page Forrester divorced him... ...it would've meant the end of his prestigious career. The end, in fact, of his livelihood. We will prove that at the time of her death... ...her brutal murder... ...Page Forrester was contemplating divorce. Thank you for your attention. Do you wish to make your statement now? Yes, your Honour. John Forrester did not murder his wife. He did not murder his wife's maid. He is an innocent man, unjustly accused. You may call your first witness. My sister directly owned 20 percent of the eight million shares outstanding. The shares were in her name. She had absolute control. Jack had less than 1 percent of the shares in his name. Mr. Lofton, could you tell us the provisions of your sister's will? Jack Forrester is the direct beneficiary of all my sister's assets. All of it? Corporate and personal assets? Yes. Mr. Lofton. Did your sister ever express any dissatisfaction... ...about Jack's administration of the company? No, she was very pleased with Jack's helmsmanship. Did she ever express any dissatisfaction to you... ...about her personal relationship with her husband? No. - Never? - Never. Do you think Jack Forrester killed your sister? - God, no! - Objection! - I move to strike that from the record. - Granted! The jury will please ignore the last remark. The People call Mrs. Virginia Howell. Describe your relationship with Page Forrester, please. We were like sisters. What did she say about her relationship with her husband? Objection. Calls for hearsay. This testimony is being offered to show the state of mind of Page Forrester. It's an exception to the hearsay rule. He's shown no connection between Mrs. Forrester's state of mind... ...and my client and the charges in this case. I'll allow it, subject to connection to Mr. Forrester. What did Page Forrester say about her relationship with her husband? She knew that he didn't love her... ...and she was sure that he was seeing someone else. Did she tell you anything else? She was going to tell her husband she wanted a divorce. Thank you. I will tolerate no further disruptions in this courtroom. Mrs. Howell. When was the last time you saw Mrs. Forrester at her home? At her home? I really don't remember. Wasn't it about the same time she stopped playing tennis with you at the club? No. We played together all the time. She's bluffing. Isn't it true, Mrs. Howell, that six months before her death... ...Page Forrester broke all contact with you? No, we spoke together on the telephone and we'd see each other at the club. Mrs. Howell... ...you find Jack Forrester an attractive man, don't you? What do you mean? Isn't it true that Page Forrester broke all contact with you... ...because she learned you were trying to seduce her husband? - That's not true. - You're under oath. Objection! Badgering the witness, your Honour. Motion denied. Isn't it true that during the week of December 7, 1984... ...you called Jack Forrester, at his office, on eight separate occasions? I don't remember that. Let me refresh your memory. December 7: 9:40 AM and 4:23 PM. December 8: 10:15 AM and 3:45 PM. Would you like me to read the list? Jesus Christ. How did you miss this? She came to us. How was I supposed to know? Did you ever write to Mr. Forrester? No. No? No. Is this note in your handwriting? Yes. I ask that this be marked as "Defence Exhibit A" and admitted as evidence. Mrs. Howell, did you send this note to Jack Forrester? Yes, I suppose so. Will you read it, please? "Dear Jack: "I've been trying to reach you all week. "I'll be at the Canyon in Palm Springs. "Wouldn't it be fun if you came down? "lsn't it silly to keep avoiding me? "Page will never know." How is it signed, Mrs. Howell? "Love, Ginny." Your Honour, may I show this to the jury? Mrs. Howell... ...did Mr. Forrester meet you in Palm Springs? No. Did he meet you any time, anywhere? No. What did he do with your note? I really don't know. He gave it to his wife, didn't he? I don't know. Why don't you ask her? Mrs. Howell... ...did Mrs. Forrester, to your knowledge... ...begin divorce proceedings against her husband? No. No further questions, your Honour. How was I supposed to find out? Only the two of them knew. Mum, I don't understand this. - Honey, why don't you go ask Jenny? - I don't want to ask Jenny! - I have a trial tomorrow, okay? - I've got a test tomorrow! - Honestly, David. - You don't care! Forget it! I hope he did it! I hope he's guilty! David, honey... Come here. David, honey, come on. I didn't... Teddy, come here. The tennis pro at the club, a guy named Slade, Bobby Slade. I talked to the bartender at the club. Two weeks ago he disappears when some guys... ...from the DA's office come to see him. Krasny's going to spring him on us. What do you have on him? He worked along the coast at all the clubs. We got La Jolla, Laguna, Newport Beach, Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz? I talked to 183 goddamned club members about that knife. Know what I get? "Nada", zilch. I told you, you're dreaming. What about former club members? - People who quit after January of last year. - That's a wild-goose chase! Sam, he didn't do it! Is that your head talking or another part of your anatomy? Okay, what the hell? Fuck me! You may call your next witness. The People call Eileen Avery, your Honour. Who's she? Your Honour, may counsel approach the bench? This witness was not mentioned in the discovery material. The prosecution isn't complying -- She's a reluctant witness. She was served a subpoena last night... ...on the basis of information uncovered yesterday. - Bullshit. - Mrs. Barnes. - I want it on the record. - I'll be happy to put it on. - You think it'll hold up in appeal? - What appeal? You don't expect to lose. Here's the subpoena, your Honour. I'll allow her testimony. Put the circumstances on the record. Thank you, your Honour. Let's continue. Let the record show that Miss Eileen Avery is a reluctant witness. She was subpoenaed on the basis of information uncovered yesterday. Who is she? A friend. - What do you mean? - A friend, that's all she is. - State your name, please - Eileen Avery. How old are you? I'm 26. What's your relationship to John C. Forrester? He's a friend of mine. Between July and December of 1983 what was your relationship? He was my... He was my lover. You had an affair with him for six months... ...two years ago? Answer the question, please. Yes, I did. You were in love with him? Yes, I was. And he was in love with you? Yes. Did Mr. Forrester ever speak to you about divorcing his wife? Please, Miss Avery. He said he wanted to. Yes? He said he could never do it. And why could he never do it? Because, he said, he would lose everything he had always worked for. Your witness, Mrs. Barnes. No questions. Thank you, Miss Avery. You may step down. The People call Robert Slade. Mr. Slade, how did you meet Mrs. Forrester? I played tennis with her at the club. And you became friends? She liked me... ...and I liked her a lot, too. It went on from there. You had an intimate sexual relationship with Mrs. Forrester? Yes. For how long? Let's see, I got to the club in November of '83... ...until the time she died. You knew she was married? Sure. - It didn't seem to bother her. - What do you mean? - She said he didn't care what she did. - Objection as to form! Sustained. Did she talk about her relationship with her husband? Objection. Hearsay. I'm trying to establish the state of mind of Mrs. Forrester prior to her murder. The testimony is irrelevant. I think I can establish the relevancy of the testimony. You may proceed. Did she ever speak to you about her relationship with her husband? - She said he didn't care what she did. - Move to strike, your Honour. Motion denied. Please continue. She said she knew he was seeing someone, too. Whoever he was seeing... ...Page said he'd take her riding all the time. Riding? She joked about it. She said those horses of his were... ...foreplay. Did Mrs. Forrester ever talk to you about divorcing her husband? She was thinking about it. She said the thing that stopped her from getting a divorce... ...is that he was doing such a good job running the company. She said he had a million-dollar image. I remember once, she said that... ...she knew he was using her, but she said... ...she was using him, too. She said that was his special talent. He really knew how to use people. Your witness. Due to the lateness of the hour, we'll adjourn and reconvene at 9:00 AM Monday. That's it. lt's over. You didn't think he'd find out? Four years ago I walked away from all this. I felt that I was drowning... Over my head. The dirt, the slime. You played me. You played me so well. No. You set me up from the very beginning. How did you find out about Styles? - That's why you wanted me to defend you. - What are you saying? If you'd told me about Avery I wouldn't have taken the case. I had an affair with somebody. That doesn't mean I killed my wife! I couldn't tell you in the beginning... ...because you wouldn't have taken the case. Later on, l... What? I couldn't, because you wouldn't have thought we were real! - You lied to me. - I had to lie to you. Don't you understand? I had to lie to you! Teddy, that stuff about Page. I didn't know anything about it. I didn't want to be used anymore. I gave all this up because I just... I wanted to clean myself off. I'm dropping the case. You can't. lt's my life. It's my life, you can't! I didn't kill her! I don't believe you. What did he say? - I told you. - I don't want to hear it. We got another letter from the 1942 Corona. I'm sorry to disturb you, your Honour. It's against all better judgement for me to speak with you. Please, your Honour. Did this hypothetical client confess his guilt... ...to his hypothetical lawyer? Then... ...the defence counsel has no real ethical dilemma. He took an oath. He must live up to that oath. What if he finds that he can't? Then he had no business taking the oath in the first place. What if someone came to you... ...under circumstances like these and asked to be dropped from a case? I probably would accede... ...to his or her wishes. But... ...with great regret. Teddy! What the fuck are you doing in the dark? Playing with yourself? Everything okay? You're going to love what we got on Bobby Slade. What the hell's the matter with you? Come on, read it. Are you okay? No. You're not okay. You look like shit. I'm sorry. Come here. I'm sorry, kid. Hear ye, hear ye. The Superior Court for the County of San Francisco is now in session. - The Honourable Clark Carrigan presiding. - Will counsel approach the bench? Do you have anything you want to say to me, Mrs. Barnes? Yes, your Honour. The defence would like to recall Bobby Slade. Recall Robert Slade. Where were you employed before coming to the Hillsborough Country Club? At the Oceanside Racquet Club in Santa Cruz. What were the circumstances under which you left there? - I don't understand. - I think you do. You were fired, were you not? No, I got a better offer from Hillsborough. Isn't it true that you were fired in Santa Cruz for selling sexual favours? - That's not true. - Perjury is a criminal offence, Mr. Slade. Objection, your Honour. I presume you know the penalty for committing perjury, Mr. Slade? That's what they said... ...but there's no proof. There's nothing on my record. I wasn't fired. I left. During the course of your intimate sexual relationship with Mrs. Forrester... ...where did you have sex with her? Motels. The house in Hillsborough. - Down at the beach house. - The house in Baker Beach? - Yes. - Where the murders took place. Did Mrs. Forrester ever pay you for having sex with her? She was beautiful. She didn't have to pay anybody. What kind of sex did you have with her? What do you mean? Did you tie her up? - Objection, your Honour! - Sustained. You fucking bitch! What did you call me? - I object! - Denied. What did you call me, Mr. Slade? You called me a bitch. Is that what you called me? Speak up, Mr. Slade. Yes. No further questions, your Honour. No questions. The People call Anthony Fabrizi. It was a 6-inch hunting knife with jags on the edge. And what locker was it in? - It was in locker 122. - And whose locker is that? It was Mr. Forrester's locker. Mr. Fabrizi, are you absolutely certain that the knife you saw... ...on January 2, 1984, was in Mr. Forrester's locker? Yes, I am certain. Your witness. No questions. The People rest. That will be all, Mr. Fabrizi. Are you ready to call your first witness, Mrs. Barnes? I am, your Honour. We call Duane Bendix. Who's Duane Bendix? Were you a member of the Hillsborough Country Club on January 2, 1984? Yes, I was. Was there a knife, on that date, in your locker at the country club? There was. What kind of knife was it? It was a hunting knife with a 6-inch blade and a jagged edge. Is this the knife? Yes, it is. What was your locker number at the club? No further questions. Your witness, Mr. Krasny. No questions. Thank you. Your Honour, we would like to recall Anthony Fabrizi. Mr. Fabrizi, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath. Thank you, Judge. Mr. Fabrizi. Are you certain, beyond any doubt, the knife you saw was in locker 122... - ...and not in locker 222? - No, it was in locker 122. I remember, because I put it together in my head that it was Mr. Forrester's. Where was Mr. Bendix's locker in relation to Mr. Forrester's? Well, it's in the row right behind his. Does this look like the knife you saw that day? - No, this one's different. - How is it different? It's the same kind of knife, but... ...this one here is all scratched up on the sides and the handle's all worn. If this knife was brand new and hadn't been used for a year and a half... ...would it look like the knife you saw? Could it have been the knife you saw? It is possible? Jesus Christ, I don't know! lt's possible! Your Honour, I'd like this knife marked... ...and admitted into evidence as "Defence Exhibit B." Your witness. - Mr. Fabrizi -- - What the hell are you going to ask me? I told her, it looks different. I don't know. If it was brand new, sure! It's possible it's the one I seen. I don't know how I could've mistaken the locker numbers. No questions. Thank you, Mr. Fabrizi. That's all. We'll adjourn and reconvene again tomorrow morning at 9:00. - Can I talk to you? - There's nothing to talk about. I tried calling you all weekend. I went over to your place. You still think I'm guilty? How can you defend me if you think I'm guilty? It happens all the time. It's the way our legal system works. I bet you're a cold fuck. What do you want, Mr. Slade? You really think you're something, don't you? You twist everything around, don't you? You just don't give a shit. I bet I could warm you up. I bet I could make you real hot. Jen, hi. What are you doing? No, I'm at the office. I just wanted to call. Why don't you get David to watch "Spiderman" while you do your homework? Okay. Why don't we talk about that when I get home, okay? All right, I love you. 'Bye. Julie Jensen? - I'd like to talk to you. My name -- - I know who you are. The Superior Court for the County of San Francisco is now in session. The Honourable Clark Carrigan presiding. Mrs. Barnes, call your next witness. We call Julie Jensen. Ms. Jensen, where do you reside? At 1326, Del Mar Lane in Santa Cruz. Would you describe for us the events that took place... ...on the night of January 21, 1984? Objection, your Honour. This testimony is not relevant. This testimony is directly related to the crimes Jack Forrester is accused of... ...and Mr. Krasny knows it. The witness may continue. I was in my bedroom. I woke up. There was a knife at my throat. There was a man there. He was dressed in black. Pants, a turtleneck. He wore a black ski mask. - I never saw his face. - Objection, your Honour. - This crime is not relevant to this case. - Overruled. He kept the knife pressed to my throat. It was a big knife. It had these jags on the top. He tied my hands and my legs to the bed. He cut my night-gown off of me. What did he do then? He pushed the knife against my nipples... ...and he cut me. How did he cut you? He cut around my right nipple with the tip of the knife. He smeared the knife with... ...the blood and he got up and he wrote it on the wall. What did he write? He wrote the word "bitch." Then he came back to the bed... ...and he started putting the knife... ...between my legs. But he didn't... ...cut me. And then he suddenly stopped... ...and he went away. And these events took place at your beach house in Santa Cruz... ...on January 21, 1984... ...18 months before the murders at Baker Beach? Yes. Well done. Ms. Jensen... ...did you relate these events to anyone from the San Francisco DA's office? Your Honour, that is irrelevant. Overruled! Yes, I did. To that man there. To this man? Mr. Arnold? - An assistant district attorney? - Yes. When did you relate these events to him? He came to see me three weeks after Mrs. Forrester was killed... ...and he came back to see me two days later. When Mr. Arnold came back to see you, what did he tell you? He told me that the Baker Beach killings were not related to what happened to me. Ms. Jensen... ...were you a member of the Oceanside Racquet Club in Santa Cruz... ...from January to October, 1983? - Yes. - Do you play tennis? I did before this happened. Did you ever play with the club's pro, Bobby Slade? - I object -- - Yes! Bobby Slade is not on trial here! Why isn't he? You knew. You hushed it up. You are trying to mislead this jury. That is not true and you know it. I will see you both in chambers. All I'm asking for is a two-week continuance. For what? To tie him into the Santa Cruz crime? He's had months to tie him but can't. He's innocent and you know it. That's why he didn't turn over her statement to me. How did you find her? How did you? She kept her name out of the papers. - We saw the police report. - We pulled it. You pulled the police report? You've breached the canon of ethics, Mr. Krasny. Now, your request is denied. If it were up to me, I'd vote to disbar you. He told you, didn't he? He told you. What did he do? Did he phone you? - Send you anonymous notes? - You'll stop at nothing, won't you? Anyone could've sent those notes. Everyone knew. The police knew, people in your office knew. Bullshit! Don't you understand what he did? He did the identical crime He knew it would get him off the hook. He knew Bobby Slade was seeing his wife. That's why he did the first crime in Santa Cruz. He threw us Bobby Slade as a suspect. He picked that woman very carefully. He knew she played tennis with Slade. He planned this for 18 months. He is not a psychopath. He is an iceman. He is a monster! You're the monster, Tom. If you make any attempt to implicate Mr. Forrester in the Santa Cruz crime... ...I shall strike it. He is not charged with that offence. They're in. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, your Honour. Not guilty. We stand in recess. I'm proud of you! I'd like to say something, please. I'd like to say something, please. Four years ago, I resigned my job as an assistant district attorney. I'd like to tell you why. I prosecuted a case with Mr. Krasny. It was a very newsworthy case. The kind of case that wins elections, makes careers. We convicted the man and he went to jail. A week after the trial, I discovered... ...that during the trial... ...one of our investigators had come up with evidence... ...which would have exonerated the man we were prosecuting... ...and that Mr. Krasny had buried that evidence. Although I found... I didn't do anything. I didn't tell anyone. I let that man... He hanged himself in prison. I will have to learn to live with that... ...somehow. The People versus Henry Styles... ...Case Number 26022. Mr. Krasny, do you have a comment on that? - We want a statement, please. - Do you have any comment, please? Your partners are very proud of you. This verdict has been a terrific vindication for our legal system. It couldn't have happened without Teddy Barnes. Where are you? - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! What's going on? We're going to my house to let you celebrate. I have no one to celebrate with except you guys. - Yes you do. Come on, you guys. - Goodbye, Mum. I feel vindicated, I think more than anything else. This verdict has been a great vindication of our system. It couldn't have happened without Teddy Barnes. I'll never be able to thank her. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Forrester. That's Jack Forrester... ...found not guilty of those brutal murders of his wife and her maid. That's the situation here. This word, just in to the Channel 7 newsroom. Police are seeking Hillsborough Country Club tennis pro, Bobby Slade... ...for questioning in the Baker Beach killings. We'll have full details and a film report at 1 1:00. Good morning. - Good afternoon. - What time is it? The time is 3:30. Are you hungry? - I'm starving. - I made some brunch down there for us. I'm going to the stables. I'll be back in 10 or 15 minutes. You know how I feel? I feel free! Free! Where are you going? It's David. He has a fever. I've got to go home. No. Go on, Ed. - What's the matter with him? - I don't know. Matthew called. - I'll come with you. - No. I'll call. Here, let me try. Can I at least kiss you goodbye? Hello? Teddy? - Yes. - How's David? He's fine. What was the matter with him? I... Nothing. You said he had a fever. I found the typewriter. What typewriter? What are you talking about? You killed her. What is the matter with you? - Teddy, I love you. - No. - Will you listen to me? - No. - I'm on my way over. - No! - Hello? - Sam? What the hell's the matter? Are you okay? - I need to talk to you. - About what? Teddy, what is it? What is it? What is it? For Christ's sake, what is it? Nothing. I just wanted to... I just wanted to say thank you. Thank me? What the fuck do you have to thank me for, baby? They got a warrant out on Bobby Slade. They're going to charge him. Did you hear me? I don't want to hear about Bobby Slade. Are you sure you're all right? Sure you don't want me to come over? No. No, nothing's wrong. It's all right now. 'Bye, Sam. I need to see your face, Jack. I could've loved -- Jesus Christ. Fuck him. He was trash.
