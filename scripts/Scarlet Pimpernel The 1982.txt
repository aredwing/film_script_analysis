'THAT DAMNED, 'ELUSIVE 'PIMPERNEL.' [LAUGHTER AND CLAPPING] OH, DO TELL US MORE ABOU THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, SIR PERCY. ALL PARIS IS TALKING ABOUT HIM. NOTHING MORE TO TELL, MY DEAR SUSAN. EXCEPT, THAT HE AND HIS BAND OF FRIENDS HAVE SWORN TO SAVE AS MANY AS THEY CAN FROM MADAME LE GUILLOTINE. AT LEAST TELL US WHO HE IS. SINK ME, MADEMOISELLE, IF I KNEW THA I'D BE THE TOAST OF LONDON, WHAT! THA WOULD SEEM TO BE THE MYSTERY. WHAT EXACTLY IS A SCARLE PIMPERNEL, SIR PERCY. NOTHING MORE THAN A HUMBLE WAYSIDE FLOWER. RATHER COMMON IN POINT OF FACT. STILL, WHAT'S IN NAME? SURELY THE DEEDS OF A MAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. I ONLY WISH THERE WERE MORE LIKE HIM. ODDS FISH, MY DEAR, ONE IS QUITE ENOUGH. THE FELLOW'S ALREADY MADE LIFE DAMNED INCONVENIENT, FOR THE REST OF US. INCONVENIENT? WHY, YES INDEED MA'AM. BECAUSE OF THIS PIMPENEL CHAP EH... YOUR REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS SUSPECT ANYONE WHO LOOKS, OR EVEN SOUNDS, SINK ME... THIS WHOLE REVOLUTION OF YOURS IS MONSTROUS INTOLERABLE. PLEASE, DON'T CREDIT US WITH THIS MADNESS. THE REVOLUTION, ITSELF, MAY HAVE STARTED AS A NOBLE ENTERPRISE. THIS... YET, WE DID BRING IT ON OURSELVES, PAPA. WE, THE FRENCH ARISTOCRACY, WITH ALL OUR ARROGANCE AND EXCESSES I FEEL MY DAUGHTER DOES OUR CLASS AN INJUSTICE. MOST OF US ARE DECENT MEN,... QUITE INNOCENT. IT IS ONLY A FEW, WHO ARE GUILTY OF ANY SERIOUS OFFENSE. YET, THE INNOCENT ARE BEING DRAGGED DOWN WITH THE GUILTY. THERE'S NO REASON GIVEN OR NEEDED. OUR WORLD IS TOPSY-TURVY, SIR PERCY. THEN WHY DO WE LOOK THE OTHER WAY, AND PRETEND NOTHING IS HAPPENING? WHILE BRAVE MEN, LIKE THIS SCARLET PIMPERNEL, DO OUR WORK FOR US. ONLY TODAY, FOR EXAMPLE, OUR FRIENDS, THE COUN AND COUNTESS DE BEAULIEU AS WELL AS THEIR ONLY SON... NO,...NOT THE BEAULIEUS... CALM YOURSELF, MY DEAR, ALL THREE WERE SPARED AT THE LAST MINUTE, THANKS TO THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. OH, THANK HEAVENS. GOD BLESS THIS SCARLET PIMPERNEL, WHOEVER HE MAY BE. SURELY, HE MUST BE AN ANGEL IN DISGUISE. AMEN. PULL-UP, OVER THERE. [SOUND OF FIGHTING] MY DEAR, MARQUIS, CONSIDER THE OFFENCE, DON'T YOU THINK YOUR METHODS ARE SLIGHTLY HARSH? THAT REVOLUTIONARY SEDUCED MY DAUGHTER, BARON DE BATZ. DRIVE ON. [FIGHTING CONTINUES] I SAY. AHHHH. UH. HA, HA. IT WOULD SEEM YOUR FRIEND IS IN DISTRESS. TO THE RESCUE. YOURS, I BELIEVE. MY DEAR CHAP. UGH. A LITTLE COGNAC, I THINK 'I CALL UPON YOU NOW 'REVENGE MY WRONG. 'YOUR FAVORS WILL BE MEASURED 'BY YOUR RAGE.' [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MARGUERITE, MARGUERITE, IT'S ARMAND, HE'S BEEN HURT. HURT? THERE'S A MAN OUTSIDE WITH A CARRIAGE. HE WANTS US TO GO WITH HIM. WHAT CAN WE DO? WE MUST GO TO HIM, AT ONCE. WHAT ABOU THE REST OF THE PLAY? MY DEAR, LOUISE, THIS IS THE CHANCE EVERY UNDERSTUDY DREAMS OF. NO, I CAN'T. I'M NOT READY! YOU'LL BE SUPERB. [KISSING HER] BUT NOT TOO SUPERB, I TRUST. WHY CAN'T YOU-? NOW, TO ARMAND. MARGUERITE! MY POOR, ARMAND! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? TWO MEN, OUT OF THE DARKNESS. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THIS GENTLEMAN... MY BROTHER AND I ARE INDEBTED TO YOU, MONSIEUR. MONSIEUR? SIR PERCY BLAKENEY, MADEMOISELLE. ALTHOUGH, ANYONE WOULD HAVE DONE AS MUCH. IF YOU THINK THAT, MONSIEUR, YOU DO NOT KNOW PARIS, WELL. WHO WERE THESE MEN THAT ATTACKED YOU, MY DARLING. THEY WERE SENT BY THE MARQUIS DE ST. CYR. I RECOGNIZED HIS CARRIAGE. NO DOUBT, TO TEACH ME A LESSON I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THIS. ONE DAY, I WILL REPAY THE MARQUIS FOR THIS. COME, MY DARLING, WE'LL GET YOU INTO BED. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN? THANK YOU. I'M QUITE ALL RIGHT, NOW. RATHER A HARSH LESSON. I TRUST THE OFFENCE WARRANTED THE PUNISHMENT. MY BROTHER IS YOUNG AND HOT-BLOODED, MONSIEUR. HIS HEART TOO OFTEN LEADS HIS HEAD. I FEAR HE HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ST. CYR'S DAUGHTER. IS LOVE, TOO, A CRIME IN FRANCE THESE DAYS? ONLY, IF THE LADY IS AN ARISTOCRAT, WHOSE FATHER INSOLENTLY THINKS THA WE'RE BOURGEOIS NOT FIT TO BREATHE THE SAME AIR THAT THEY DO. IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I MUST TEND TO MY BROTHER. WAIT! WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN? MY BROTHER AND I ARE HAVING A SMALL SOIRE AT OUR HOME IN THE RUE DO VICHELIEU SUNDAY NEXT- IF YOU ARE FREE. FOR SUCH AND INITIATION, MADEMOISELLE, I SHALL MAKE...MYSELF FREE. SUNDAY, NEXT, THEN. NUMBER 27. CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS, MY DEAR. YOU PLAYED A GREAT SUCCESS, WE HEAR. SOLD OUT EVERY NIGHT. ISN'T IT AMAZING. I WAS SURE NO ONE WOULD COME. OH, NONSENSE. ALL KINDS ADORE YOU. MY DEAR, HAVEN' YOU HEARD THE NEWS? NEWS? EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT. THERE WERE OVER 20 EXECUTIONS IN THE PLACE DE LA CREIAS, TODAY. TWENTY-THREE, TO BE PRECISE. PAUL! MY DEAR, I'VE ONLY JUST BEEN ABLE TO TEAR MYSELF AWAY. OH. YOU LOOK SO TIRED. COME, LET'S HAVE SOME CHAMPAGNE. [LAUGHTER] YOU SAY THERE WERE 23 EXECUTIONS TODAY, CHAUVELIN? TO BE PRECISE, AND THERE WILL BE MORE, EVERYDAY, UNTIL THE COMMITTEE HAS PURGED THE REPUBLIC OF THE LAS CORRUPT ARISTOCRAT. NOT ANOTHER SPEECH, CHAUVELIN! THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO LISTEN TO ALL DAY NOW, MY DEAR. ALL DAY? I'M AFRAID SO. THIS YOUNG IDEALIST HAS JUST BECOME MY ASSISTANT. SO HE HAS NO CHOICE. YOU MUST BE CALLED CHAUVELIN. CHIEF AGENT FOR THE COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL SECURITY, AT YOUR SERVICE. MADEMOISELLE...? YOU HAVE THE HONOR OF ADDRESSING LOUISE LONGET, LA CHANTESS. BUT, OF COURSE. YOU'RE MARGUERITE'S NEW UNDERSTUDY. I GATHER YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ARREST AND EXECUTION OF ALL THESE... UNDESIRABLE ARISTOCRATS. THAT IS A SMALL PAR OF MY DUTIES, MADEMOISELLE. THE OTHER IS MAKING LONG, BORING SPEECHES AT SOCIAL FUNCTIONS LIKE THIS. WELL, NOW YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE BORING SPEECHES, TOO. VERY WELL, JUST FOR THIS ONCE, I WILL OVERCOME MY USUAL PATRIOTIC ZEAL, AND CONFINE MYSELF TO A SIMPLE TOAST TO THE REPUBLIC. THE REPUBLIC! [ALL] THE REPUBLIC. SEEMS THE BARON DE BATZ DOES NO SHARE OUR ENTHUSIASM FOR THE TOAST. PERHAPS HE IS NOT A FRIEND OF... THE REPUBLIC. OH, ON THE CONTRARY, MY DEAR CHAUVELIN, I MAY BE AN AUSTRIAN, BY NATIONALITY, AND ARISTOCRAT BY BIRTH, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I AM A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF THE REPUBLIC. I BELIEVE, RATHER, THA THE BARON IS A FRIEND OF PROFIT, WILLING TO SELL HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. IT WOULD APPEAR, MADEMOISELLE, THAT MY PRESENCE HERE THIS EVENING IS GIVING YOU DISTRESS. I SHALL CAUSE YOU NO FURTHER EMBARRASSMENT, AND I SHALL BID YOU GOOD EVENING. THIS JUST SHOWS HOW VIGILANT WE MUST BE. WE HAVE TO ROOT OU THE ENEMIES IN OUR MIDST. WE NEVER KNOW WHERE THEY MIGHT STRIKE NEXT. BUT, IF BLOOD HAS TO BE SHED, NO ONE, I PROMISE YOU REGRETS IT MORE THAN I DO. "THE DAUPHIN IS TO BE HELD PRISONER IN THE TEMPLE. ST. CYR." AH, THERE YOU ARE. HOW COULD YOU BE SO RUDE? TO DE BATZ? HE WAS A GUES IN MY HOME. AN UNWORTHY GUEST. THE MAN IS SUSPECTED OF SELLING SECRET INFORMATION TO THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT. AND WHY HAVEN' YOU ARRESTED HIM? BECAUSE, MY DEAR, HE ALSO SELLS SECRET INFORMATION, ABOUT THE AUSTRIANS, TO US. YOU'VE EXECUTED MEN FOR LESS. REVOLUTIONS ARE NEVER BLOODLESS. THIS BRIEF REIGN OF TERROR, WILL PURGE THE LAND OF ALL CORRUPTION. AND TAKE US TO NEW HEIGHTS. BE CAREFUL WHERE I TAKES YOU, PAUL. TO A NEW ORDER. TO THE DAY OF GLORY. AND WE WILL BE PROUD OF IT, MARGARITE, YOU AND I. JUST AS WE'VE ALWAYS DREAMED. AND THEN I WILL MAKE YOU MY WIFE. AND THE FUTURE WILL BE OURS. SIR PERCY! LORD, MADEMOISELLE, YOU ARE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL, THAN I RECALL. IF THAT IS POSSIBLE. PAUL, THIS IS THE GENTLEMAN WHO RESCUED ARMAND. PAUL CHAUVELIN, CHIEF AGEN OF THE COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL SECURITY. SIR PERCY BLAKENEY. IT IS A PLEASURE... MONSIEUR. THE PLEASURE, I CAN ASSURE YOU, IS ALL MINE. MONSEWER. HA, HA, HA. I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR ME TARDINESS. 'TWAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE, FINDING A CARRIAGE. SINK ME, IF EVERYONE ISN' SO EQUAL IN YOUR NEW SOCIETY THAT NO ONE WANTS TO DO THE DRIVING ANYMORE. I TAKE IT, SIR, THAT YOU DO NO APPROVE OF OUR NEW SOCIETY? APPROVAL, SIR, IN MY OPINION, DEMANDS THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFECTION. AND IN THAT SENSE, YOU RATHER OVERRATE THE CHARM OF YOUR SOCIETY. FAITH, FOR ONE THING, IT DOES SEEM MONSTROUS ILL-DRESSED FOR ANY SOCIETY, EVEN A NEW ONE. SINK ME, YOUR TAILORS HAVE BETRAYED YOU. BETRAYED US? WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON OUR FRENCH TAILORS. ODDS FISH, MY DEAR FELLOW, SUCH SHODDY WORKMANSHIP WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED IN LONDON FOR ONE TINY INSTANT. LOOK YOU HERE, SIR, AT THIS LIMP CRAVAT. I ASK YOU! OR THE SORRY CU OF THIS SLEEVE. NO, NO, NO. OF THE SAD STATE OF THOSE CUFFS. SINK ME, I CAN HARDLY BRING MESELF TO LOOK UPON THEM. NO, NO, NO, SIR. IF THIS IS THE BES YOUR TAILORS CAN DO. 'TWOULD SERVE YOU BETTER TO SEND THEM TO THE GUILLOTINE. WE WILL SEND OUR KING, INSTEAD, SIR, AND EXALT OUR TAILORS. MORE'S THE PITY. THEN YOUR TAILORS WILL RULE THE LAND, AND NO ONE WILL MAKE THE CLOTHES. SO MUCH FOR FRENCH FASHION, AND FRENCH POLITICS. WHAT IS IT YOU FRENCHIES SAY? TWO-SHAY..., YOU SEE, I'M A BIT OF A POET, AND YOU DID NOT KNOW IT. WHAT? WELL, IT HAS BEEN MOS AMUSING, SIR PERCY. BUT, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE SOMEONE I MUST SEE INSIDE. MARGUERITE, MY DEAR. YOU REALLY MUSTNT TEASE CHAUVELIN SO RECKLESSLY. HE'S VERY POWERFUL IN THE GOVERNMENT. ALREADY, HE'S ROBESPIERRE'S MOST TRUSTED AGENT. THE ONLY POWER THAT I CAN SEE AT PRESENT, MADEMOISELLE, IS THE POWER... OF YOUR BEAUTY. BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, SIR PERCY. THIS BEHOLDER... IS ENCHANTED. IF I WERE TO TELL YOU THAT I ADORE YOU, WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO SO, STINTINGLY? ADORE ME? OR WOULD YOU HAVE ME DECLARE IT AS I FEEL IT? WITH ALL MY HEART. BUT YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME. EXACTLY SO. WHICH IS WHY I YEARN TO KNOW EVERYTHING. YOU MUST TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOURSELF. IN EVERY DETAIL. BUT EVER SO SLOWLY. SO VERY SLOWLY. SO THAT IT TAKES A VERY... VERY LONG TIME. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ARE MAD, OR... DESPERATELY IN LOVE. 'TIS ALL THE SAME. TELL ME IF YOU CAN... THAT YOU DO NOT FEEL IT? PLEASE... YOU MOVE TOO FAST. MY HEART... DICTATES THE PACE. GOOD MORNING, CITIZEN ROBESPIERRE. THANK YOU, ST. CYR. CHAUVELIN. THE REPORT INFORMS ME, THERE MAY BE AN ATTEMP TO RESCUE THE ROYAL FAMILY, PARTICULARLY, THE YOUNG DAUPHIN, HEIR TO THE THRONE. I SHALL SEE TO IT THA SECURITY IS TIGHTENED AT ONCE. AND ANOTHER THING, THERE IS ONE ENEMY OF THE REPUBLIC IN PARTICULAR WHO CONTINUES TO ELUDE US, A MAN WE CONSIDER MORE DANGEROUS THAN ALL THE OTHERS COMBINED, THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, CITIZEN, THE MAN HAS SPARED BARELY A HANDFUL FROM THE GUILLOTINE, OUT OF HUNDREDS. SURELY, WE OVERESTIMATE HIS IMPORTANCE. ON THE CONTRARY, UNCHECKED HIS CONTINUED SUCCESS COULD UNDERMINE THE REVOLUTION ITSELF. UNDERMINE THE REVOLUTION? BY RAISING THE HOPES OF THOSE WHO ARE CONSPIRING TO OVERTHROW THE REPUBLIC AND RESTORE THE MONARCHY. SO YOU SEE, CHAUVELIN, WHILE THIS MEDDLESOME HE CONTINUES TO BE A MENACE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE MAN WHO BRINGS HIM TO JUSTICE WILL EARN THE GRATITUDE OF THE NATION. NOT TO MENTION, A SEA ON THE COMMITTEE. HE MUST BE STOPPED, CHAUVELIN. I SHALL SEE TO I AT ONCE, CITIZEN. HOW IS OUT YOUNG FRIEND, ARMAND ST. JUST, SETTLING IN? A BIT HEADSTRONG, PERHAPS, BUT I SUSPECT HE'LL GO FAR. HUH, HUH, HUH. [CLOCK CHIMES] "YOU CAN INFORM YOUR PEOPLE, THAT THE DAUPHIN IS TO BE HELD PRISONER IN THE TEMPLE. ST. CYR." SIR PERCY BLAKENEY, MADEMOISELLE. PLEASE, SHOW HIM IN, ANNETTE. UH, FORGIVE ME... IF I KEPT YOU WAITING. YOUR NOTE DID SAY ELEVEN. I HAD A DEVIL OF A TIME FINDING A SUITABLE BASKET. A SUITABLE...BASKET? HMM. I THOUGHT...A PICNIC. PERCY! PAPERS. PAPERS..IF YOU PLEASE. SINK ME. SURELY YOU RECOGNIZE THE MOS BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS IN FRANCE. A MAN WOULD HAVE TO BE BLIND NOT TO RECOGNIZE MADEMOISELLE MARGUERITE ST. JUST. YOU THERE! MAKE WAY! LET THIS CARRIAGE PASS! CAREFUL NOW. UGH! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, NOW? YES, INDEED, MANY THANKS. DAMN THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL! NOW HE'S MADE OFF WITH THE DUC DE LEON. HE HAS PROVED MOST ELUSIVE, CITIZEN. A MAN OF MANY DISGUISES, BUT, I NOW BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO CATCH HIM. HOW TO YOU PROPOSE TO FIND BY SIMPLE DEDUCTION, PONCEAU. MANAGES TO PASS HIMSELF OFF AS A FRENCH. IT FOLLOWS, THEREFORE, THAT HE COMES FROM THAT PRIVILEGED CLASS BROUGHT UP BY FRENCH GOVERNESSES, TUTORED BY FRENCH INSTRUCTORS, AND PERHAPS EVEN EDUCATED AT A FRENCH UNIVERSITY. IN A WORD, THE MAN IS UNDOUBTEDLY AN ARISTOCRAT. AND THAT WOULD EXPLAIN HIS SYMPATHIES, AND NARROW THE FIELD CONSIDERABLY. I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SHALL FIND HIM AT THE CENTER OF SOCIAL LIFE IN LONDON, AND THAT IS WHERE I PROPOSE WE TRACK HIM DOWN. HE DOES HAVE A POINT, PONCEAU. WHILE HE'S IN FRANCE, THE CUNNING FOX IS ALWAYS ON HIS GUARD, BUT IN HIS OWN BACKYARD, UM? WE SHALL HAVE YOU APPOINTED SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE COURT OF ST. JAMES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PONCEAU WILL SEE TO THE DETAILS. I AM DEEPLY HONORED, CITIZEN. WOULD IT NOT BE ADVISABLE IF I WERE TO HAVE THE ASSISTANCE OF SOMEONE WHO IS ALREADY SOMEONE, WHOM THEY TRUST. I SUSPECT YOU ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE IN MIND. MIGHT I SUGGEST THE MAN WHO SERVED OUR RECENTLY DEPOSED KING AS AMBASSADOR IN LONDON FOR SO LONG? I LIKE YOUR SENSE OF IRONY, CHAUVELIN. BY ALL MEANS. THE COUNT DE TOURNEY WOULD BE AN IDEAL CHOICE. SEND YOUNG ARMAND ST. JUSTE TO BRING HIM IN. YOU MUST NOT GO, HENRI. I ASSURE YOU, MADAME, CITIZEN ROBESPIERRE MERELY WISHES TO CONSULT WITH YOU HUSBAND ON A MATTER OF STATE. ROBESPIERRE? I'D SOONER TRUST A SNAKE. YOU HAVE KNOWN ME ALL MY LIFE. I GIVE YOU MY WORD, NO HARM WILL COME TO HIM. WELL, THERE. YOU SEE, MAMA? YOU HAVE ARMAND'S WORD OF HONOR. I SHALL BE BACK IN TIME FOR SUPPER. DEATH, ROBBING MY EYES OF LIGHT, WILL GIVE BACK TO THE SUN ITS TARNISHED BEAUTY. [APPLAUSE, CHEERING] PERCY? PERCY. 'MY BELOVED, I'VE HAD TO RETURN TO ENGLAND URGENTLY. 'FORGIVE ME, I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO KISS YOU FAREWELL. 'YOUR OWN, PERCY.' SPY? ON MY FORMER ASSOCIATES, FRIENDS? YOU STILL REFUSE? MOST EMPHATICALLY. YOU MUST BE MAD. TAKE HIM TO THE TEMPLE. PERHAPS SOME TIME IN PRISON WILL BRING HIM TO HIS SENSES. ANDREW, DO YOU WAN TO DOUBLE YOUR WAGER? ANDREW! RIGHT! A HUNDRED GUINEAS! YOU'LL NEVER BEAT HIM! WELL, HANG ON TO ME TAIL! SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH HIM! JUST YOU WAIT! MY GOODNESS, THOUGH, YOU CAN DO IT. YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD JUDGE OF HORSE FLESH. YOU'RE DAMNED RIGHT. THAT'S A HUNDRED GUINEAS, YOU OWE ME, OLD CHAP. HEY, PERCY. ALIVE, WHO WOULDN'T BE PROUD TO JOIN THE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. THAT MAY BE, MY FRIEND, BUT THE GREATER THE NUMBER, THE GREATER THE RISK OF BETRAYAL. NO, NO, MY FRIENDS, IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED WE MUST MAINTAIN OUR ANONYMITY. MASK OUR IDENTITIES. EVEN IF IT MEANS SUFFERING THE MOCKERY OF OTHERS, BEING TAKEN FOR FOOLS, FOPS, NITWITS, EVEN COWARDS. UMM. THAT'S THE EASY PART. THE HARD PART IS NOT BEING ABLE TO BOAST ABOUT OUR EXPLOITS TO THE LADIES. [LAUGHTER] TIMMY. WHAT IS IT, MY DEAR FELLOW? WELL, COME ON, OUT WITH IT. LOUIS THE SIXTEENTH HAS BEEN EXECUTED. THE QUEEN? DOOMED TO FOLLOW HIM TO THE GUILLOTINE. WHAT NEWS OF THE YOUNG DAUPHIN? THE HEIR TO THE THRONE HAS BEEN IMPRISONED IN THE TEMPLE. AND THERE'S MORE. YOUR FRIEND THE COUNT DE TOURNEY HAS ALSO BEEN ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO THE TEMPLE. HIS FAMILY? THEY'RE STILL SAFE BY THE LAST REPORT. THEN THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE. ANDREW, I WANT YOU TO SET UP A NETWORK OF COURIERS. WE LEAVE FOR PARIS AT ONCE. DELIVER THIS TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD IN THE PLACE DE LA GREVE. YES, SIR. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M BUSY? YOU HAVE ARRESTED THE COUNT DE TOURNEY. I HAVE. ON THE ORDERS OF CITIZEN ROBESPIERRE. I GAVE MY WORD OF HONOR. MAY I REMIND YOU, THAT YOUR FIRST DUTY IS TO THE REPUBLIC AND NOT TO THE COUNT DE TOURNEY IN THIS HOUR. YOU MAY GO. [DOOR CLOSES] MY DEAR ARMAND. SUCH SENTIMENTS, ESPECIALLY ON BEHALF OF AN ARISTOCRAT, COULD BE EASILY MISINTERPRETED. YOU USED ME. YES, AND AS LONG AS YOU ARE HERE TO SERVE THE COMMITTEE I SHALL CONTINUE TO USE YOU. NOW, BOY, DELIVER THIS, TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD IN CHARGE OF EXECUTIONS IN THE PLACE DE LA GREVE. [DOOR CLOSES] [DRUMS ROLL] [DRUMS CONTINUE TO ROLL] [GUILLOTINE FALLS] [CROWD CHEERS] [DEATH TO THE ARISTOS] [LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC] SIR! CAPTAIN. 'MUST HAVE MORE EXECUTIONS, AND PROCEED WITH GREATER DISPATCH!' YOU CAN TELL CITIZEN CHAUVELIN, IF HE THINKS HE CAN DO BETTER, HE'S QUITE WELCOME TO COME AND TRY FOR HIMSELF. MIGHT DO HIM GOOD. TO GET SOME BLOOD ON THOSE LILY WHITE HANDS OF HIS. AH! IN THE NAME OF GOD, MONSIEUR, SAVE ME. I SWEAR I'VE DONE NOTHING, NOTHING! SAVE YOUR BREATH, MADEMOISELLE, HE'S ONE OF THEM WHO SENT YOU HERE. [SPIT!] MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL, MONSIEUR. YOU'RE SURELY DAMNED FOR WHAT YOU DO! [SCREAM] AHHH, AH! WHAT IS IT? [SIGH, GASP] A DREAM. A HIDEOUS DREAM. [GASP] SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH? NO, IT'S MARGUERITE. IT WAS SHE THEY HAD TO THE GUILLOTINE. IT WAS HER WHEN I HEARD IT FELL. OH, GOD. OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD. 'YOU CAN INFORM YOUR PEOPLE THA 'THE DAUPHIN IS TO BE HELD 'PRISONER IN THE TEMPLE. 'ST. CYR.' [APPLAUSE FOR MARGUERITE] MY DARLING! MARGUERITE, MY DEAREST. PAUL! WHAT IS IT, MY DEAR. YOU LOOK AS IF YOU'D SEEN A GHOST? IT'S JUST YOU TOOK ME BY SURPRISE. WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE HIDING BEHIND YOUR BACK? I MIGHT ASK YOU THE SAME. YOU HAVE NOT RIGHT TO PRY INTO MY PERSONAL AFFAIRS. EVEN WHEN THOSE PERSONAL AFFAIRS SMACK OF TREASON? TREASON? SURELY, YOU DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH...? PAUL... I SWEAR I HAPPENED UPON THIS NOTE ONLY BY CHANCE. WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO ME WITH IT? I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I THINK I WANTED TO BE SURE THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH BEFORE I DID ANYTHING SO DRASTIC. DRASTIC? AS REPORT IT TO THE COMMITTEE. [LAUGHING] MY DARLING MARGUERITE, I'M NOT THE COMMITTEE. I'M THE MAN WHO HOPE ONE DAY TO MARRY YOU. BUT YOU ARE AN AGEN OF THE COMMITTEE. WOULDN'T IT BE YOUR DUTY TO REPORT IT... MY FIRST DUTY, MY DEAREST, IS TO YOU. I MAY NOT ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO SHOW IT. BUT I LOVE YOU. WITH ALL MY HEART. I GIVE YOU MY WORD, I WILL NEVER BETRAY YOUR CONFIDENCE. FORGIVE ME, PAUL. ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS YOUR DUTY TO REPOR THIS TO ME OFFICIALLY. AND THEN, AND ONLY THEN, I'LL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION. BUT THAT COULD MEAN ST. CYR'S EXECUTION, AND POSSIBLY HIS FAMILY'S AS WELL. HE'S A TRAITOR. AND CAN YOU THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO REPAY HIM FOR HAVING YOUR BROTHER BEATEN? YOU CAN'T HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT I WOULD SEND A MAN AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY TO THEIR DEATH OUT OF SPITE? THEY'RE ARISTOCRATS, MY DEAR! [WHISPERING] I COULD NEVER LIVE WITH MYSELF! IN THAT CASE, YOU MAY HAVE ONE DAY TO ANSWER TO THE REPUBLIC. RATHER THE REPUBLIC THAN MY CONSCIENCE. YOU DISAPPOINT ME. YOU'VE GONE SOFT! IF BY THAT YOU MEAN I'M NO BLOODTHIRSTY ENOUGH FOR THIS REVOLUTION OF YOURS, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT USED TO BE YOUR REVOLUTION AS WELL. YES... BUT IT'S TAKEN US IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. PERHAPS MY VISION WAS NEVER THE SAME AS YOURS. I SEE NOW, WHAT BEGINS AS A DREAM CAN END AS A NIGHTMARE. SOME CAUSES CAN BECOME WARPED, TWISTED LIKE SOME MEN. IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO GUESS THE REASON FOR THIS SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART. I SUSPECT IT'S THE ARISTOCRATIC COMPANY YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING OF LATE. WHY, PAUL, I DO BELIEVE YOUR JEALOUS. WHY SHOULD I NOT BE? WELL, IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, SIR. PERCY LEFT FOR ENGLAND A FORTNIGHT AGO. AND THEN YOU DON'T KNOW. KNOW WHAT? THAT HE'S BACK. IN PARIS? [WITH FEELING] YOU KNOW, IT AMAZES ME HOW A WOMAN OF YOUR TASTE AND INTELLIGENCE COULD TOLERATE SUCH A FOOL. AND NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. I HAVE SOME DUTIES TO ATTEND TO. [OPENS DOOR] BON-JEWER, MON-SEWER. I SWEAR YOU BEEN TAKIN' LESSONS. THE CRAVAT'S A PICTURE. OH, UGH. OH, OUTTA' MY WAY! YOU IDIOT! [DOOR CLOSES] PERCY! PERCY, PERCY! HA, HA, HA, HA, HA. I KNEW YOU WOULD COME BACK! MY DARLING! WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE PLEASED TO SEE ME. IT'S MORE THAN YOU CAN SAY FOR YOUR FRIEND, CHAUVELIN. POSITIVELY NO SENSE OF HUMOR. MUST BE HIS DIET. OH, PLEASE, DON'T BE SO FLIPPANT, PERCY. CHAUVELIN IS TERRIBLY JEALOUS. HE ACTUALLY FRIGHTENS ME. FRIGHTENS YOU, MY DEAR. NONSENSE. I WANT YOU TO FORGET, CHAUVELIN. FORGET EVERY MEN YOU'VE EVER KNOWN. EXCEPT ME. HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE. SOMETIMES... YOU'RE SO... ELUSIVE. ARE YOU AN ACTOR, TOO? PLAYING OUT SOME PART IN A STRANGE CHARADE? I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE, MY DEAR, THE ONE THING YOU MUST NEVER DOUB IS MY SINCERITY. I KNOW BEHIND THAT MASK HIDES THE TRUE PERCY BLAKENEY. THAT'S THE MAN I YEARN TO KNOW. AND SO YOU SHALL, MY DEAR. ALL IN GOOD TIME. HOW LONG IS THAT? MARRY ME,...AND YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,...TO FIND OUT. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO ME THAT WILL MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND. THAT NOT TO YOU, PERHAPS, BUT I WONDER WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ALL YOUR ARISTOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, IF YOU FAMILY WERE LANGUISHING IN HERE, AS WELL? YOU WOULDN'T DARE. YOU WILL HAVE UNTIL TOMORROW TO RECONSIDER. I INTEND TO WARN THE DE TOURNEY FAMILY AND HELP THEM FLEE, IF NECESSARY. NOW, LOOK HERE, MY DEAR FELLOW. I DID NOT SAVE YOUR NECK FROM THOSE THUGS OF ST. CYR'S MERELY TO SEE YOU LOSE YOUR HEAD AT THE GUILLOTINE. [SIGH] WHAT? MY MIND IS QUITE MADE UP, PERCY. I WILL WARN THE DE TOURNEYS. THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO STOP ME. I HAVE NO INTENTION... OF STOPPING YOU. DO YOU SUPPOSE...THAT YOU COULD GET INTO THE TEMPLE PRISON... AND SEE THE COUNT... TONIGHT? UGH, WELL, I...I THINK SO. BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE? -I...HAVE A PLAN. -OH...YOU HAVE A PLAN. YOU, WHO ARE PRACTICALLY INCAPABLE OF ANY THOUGHT ENTERING INTO YOU HEAD THAT IS NOT TRIVIAL. [SIGH] OH, REALLY, PERCY. -THIS IS SERIOUS. -SO AM I. DEADLY SERIOUS. WE MUST RESCUE THE DE TOURNEY FAMILY, WITHOUT RISKING YOU. YOU CAN BE FAR MORE VALUABLE TO US IF YOU KEEP IN WITH CHAUVELIN AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. USEFUL TO US. WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU MUST SWEAR, BY ALL YOU HOLD SACRED THAT WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO HEAR, YOU WILL NOT REPEAT TO ANYONE. -REALLY, PERCY,... -NOT EVEN MARGUERITE! YOU MUST BE QUITE MAD. DO YOU SWEAR? [SIGH] VERY WELL. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT INSIGNIA? LOOKS LIKE A FLOWER OF SOME SORT. CORRECT. IT IS A SCARLET PIMPERNEL. [GUILLOTINE DROPS] [CROWD CHEERS] DEATH TO THE ARISTOS. LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC. OH, I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE COME TO YOUR SENSES. -YOU LEFT ME LITTLE CHOICE. -WELL, THAT WAS THE GENERAL IDEA. YOU WILL LEAVE FOR LONDON AT ONCE. UNDER GUARD, OF COURSE. ONCE THERE, YOU WILL RESIDE AT OUR FRENCH EMBASSY SO YOU CAN INTRODUCE -AND MY FAMILY? -THEY ARE TO REMAIN IN PARIS. AH. AND SO MY FAMILY ARE NOT TO BE IN PRISON, THEY ARE TO BE HELD HOSTAGE. THAT IS THE GENERAL IDEA. TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR FRIEND. [DRUMS AND CROWDS ARE HEARD] -IT'S HER OWN MOTHER. -WHOS IS IT? -ALWAYS HE'S IN IT, THE MOTHER, RIGHT? -YEAH ALL RIGHT. FETCH ME YOUR PAPERS. HERE'YA. HE THINKS I'M AN ARISTOCRAT. [LAUGHTER] CASKS OF WINE, HERE, HAVE WE? RIGHT, I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE. I WOULDN'T DO THA IF I WERE YOU. OH, MAKE MY SPOILT OUT. NA, NA, ...SERGEANT, ...ME GRANDSON. HERE'YA, HERE'YA. COME HERE, SERGEANT. HERE. A WORD IN YOUR EAR, SERGEANT. ALL RIGHT, HE'S GOT THE PLAGUE. PLAGUE. I TOLD YOU, I TRIED TO WARN YOU. GET HIM AWAY FROM HERE! TAKE HIM AWAY FROM HERE! ALL RIGHT. HERE, TAKE YOUR PAPERS. ALL RIGHT YOU ARE, SERGEANT, RIGHT. OPEN THE GATES! PAPERS. SHOW ME YOUR PAPERS. SERGEANT. AN OLD WOMAN WILL PASS THIS WAY WITH A CART. YOU ARE TO ARRES HER AT ONCE. AN OLD WOMAN JUST PASSED THIS WAY FIVE MINUTES AGO. YOU LET HER GO! THAT WAS THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL! OPEN THE GATES! HEH, HEH, HEH, HEH. HEH, HEH. EVERYTHING GO AS PLANNED? LIKE CLOCKWORK, PERCY. GOOD. WELL, BEST BE ON YOUR WAY. IT'LL BE DARK, SOON. MORE THAN A NIGHT'S RIDE TO THE COAST. MADEMOISELLE. THIS WAY, COUNTESS. WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE, MONSIEUR. IT IS THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, NOT I, WHO DESERVES YOUR THANKS, COUNTESS. I WAS CERTAIN THAT YOU WERE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. I WOULD NEVER PRESUME TO FILL THOSE SHOES. I LACK SUFFICIENT COURAGE. I HAVE YET TO MEE A MORE COURAGEOUS CAVALIER, OR A MORE HANDSOME ONE. SUSAN. IT'S DANGEROUS. WE MUST HURRY. THANK YOU, MONSIEUR. YOU MUST BE VERY MUCH LIKE YOUR MOTHER. I'M AN UGLY DUCKLING BY COMPARISON. THEY SAY SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BRIDE IN FRANCE. PERHAPS IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE BRIGHTEST, THE MOST RADIANT OF WOMEN SHOULD MARRY AN UTTER FOOL, WHEN ONE RECALLS, THAT HE'S ALSO SAID TO BE THE RICHEST MAN IN ENGLAND. I THINK YOU'D BETTER LEAVE. AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM QUITE BUSY. I CAME TO FIND OUT WHA YOU HAVE DECIDED TO DO ABOUT THE MARQUIS DE ST. CYR. THAT'S MY AFFAIR, NOT YOURS. NO, IT IS MY AFFAIR. AS CHIEF AGENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL SECURITY I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU INTEND TO DO YOUR DUTY AS A CITIZEN AND REPORT HIM. AND IF I SAY NO? THEN, I AM PREPARED TO DO IT FOR YOU. YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD. MARGUERITE. YOU FORCE MY HAND. YOU HAVE BETRAYED MY CONFIDENCE. IT APPEARS THAT WE HAVE BOTH MISJUDGED ONE ANOTHER. [UNLOCKING AND OPENING A PRISON CELL DOOR] MR. BLAND. YOU'VE GOT VISITORS. LET HIM REST FOR A LITTLE MORE TIME. LEAVE HIM BE. SHUT UP, WOMAN. THERE HE IS, BARON. KING LOUIS' LITTLE BRA IN THE FLESH. HEH, HEH. WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOUR ARISTOCRATIC SENSIBILITIES OFFENDED? ARE THEY TREATING YOU WELL, YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS? WELL, ENOUGH. GET HIM UP, DUVAL. WALK HIM AROUND. NO, THAT WON' BE NECESSARY. I'VE SEEN ALL I WISH TO SEE, THANK YOU. [CELL DOOR CLOSES] MY DEAR MARQUIS, THERE ARE GUARDS ALL OVER THE PLACE. POSITIONED HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE, AND THIS APARTMENT HERE HOUSES THE COUPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AFTER THE DAUPHIN. SO YOU SEE, IT WOULD BE HUMANLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE YOUNG BOY OUT OF THE PLACE. [LOUD KNOCKING] IN THE NAME OF THE REPUBLIC, OPEN UP. OPEN IN THE NAME OF THE REPUBLIC [DOOR OPENS SUDDENLY] ARREST THEM BOTH. WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS? I HAVE AN ORDER FOR THE ARREST OF THE MARQUIS DE ST. CYR. ONE MOMENT CAPTAIN. ONE MOMENT. I THINK YOU'D BETTER HAVE A LOOK AT THIS. A CERTIFICATE OF IMMUNITY. YOU ARE THE BARON DE BATZ? PRECISELY. SIGNED, AS YOU CAN SEE, BY CITIZEN FOUQUET, HIMSELF. RELEASE THE MAN. I DEMAND TO KNOW THE CHARGE. TREASON. TREASON, WHO ACCUSES ME OF TREASON? I WILL HAVE HIS NAME! SEE FOR YOURSELF. IT'S WRITTEN ON THE WARRANT. MARGUERITE ST. JUST? BUT I...I HARDLY KNOW THE WOMAN. I WILL. I WILL. I PERCY, TAKE THEE, MARGUERITE, TO MY WEDDED WIFE. I, MARGUERITE, TAKE THEE, PERCY, TO MY WEDDED HUSBAND. WITH THIS RING, I THEE WED. THIS GOLD AND SILVER, I THEE GIVE. WITH MY BODY, I THEE WORSHIP. WITH ALL MY WORLDLY GOODS, I THEE ENDOW. IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, AND OF THE SON, AND OF THE HOLY GHOST, AMEN. WE'RE OFF TO LONDON IN THE MORNING. ISN'T IT WONDERFUL? ARMAND FOLLOWS IN A FEW DAYS FEW DAYS? NATURALLY, CHAUVELIN IS ANXIOUS TO ASSUME HIS NEW POST AS SPECIAL ENVOY. LOOK AT HER, TONY. TELL ME IF YOU CAN, THAT I'M NOT THE MOS FORTUNATE MAN ALIVE. HOW THEY BUZZ ROUND HER, LIKE BEES TO HONEY. POOR LOUISE, THINGS WERE ALL OF THAT THEN TO ENGLAND. HUH? WELL, I HAVE ASKED HER TO COME ALONG AND BE MY WIFE. AND GIVE UP A PERFECTLY MARVELOUS CAREER? DON'T YOU DARE, MY DEAR. HE'S NOT WORTH IT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT CITIZEN ROBESPIERRE'S DEMAND FOR ACTION? THE DE TOURNEYS ARE LOST TO US. I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND AN EXCELLEN REPLACEMENT FOR THE COUNT DE TOURNEY. PERHAPS, EVEN, AN IMPROVEMENT. IN MARGUERITE ST. JUST? IN THE WIFE OF SIR PERCY BLAKENEY, BARONET. EVERY DOOR IN LONDON WILL BE OPEN TO HER. EVERY CONFIDENCE SHARED. EVERY SECRET KNOWN. SHE ISN'T AWARE OF IT YET, PONCEAU, BUT LADY BLAKENEY IS GOING TO LEAD ME TO OUR ELUSIVE FRIEND THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. I'VE NEVER SEEN HER LOOKING HAPPIER. AS WELL SHE MIGHT. ON THE SAME DAY SHE MARRIES THE MAN SHE LOVES, HAVE HER REVENGE ON THE MAN SHE HATES. - THE MAN SHE HATES, BARON? - THE MARQUIS ST. CYR. FOR WHAT HE DID TO HER BROTHER. AND WHAT MANNER OF REVENGE MIGHT SHE HAVE HAD ON THE MARQUIS? WELL, HAVING HIM ARRESTED FOR TREASON, OF COURSE. WHAT LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT MY WIFE WAS INVOLVED IN THAT? OH, COME, SIR PERCY, YOU NEED HAVE NO PRETENSES WITH ME. I SAW THE WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST WITH MY OWN EYES. PHEW! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! YOU WIFE'S NAME WAS ON IT. FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AFTER ALL, I AM A MAN OF EXTREME DISCRETION. PERCY, DON'T... THE MAN WILL BE GUILLOTINED FOR THIS. MY DEAR, SIR PERCY, HAVE YOU NOT HEARD? THE MARQUIS DE ST. CYR AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY WERE BEHEADED THIS VERY MORNING. ALL OF THEM? THE CHILDREN AS WELL? WELL...WELL, YES. SIR PERCY, I...I'D ACTUALLY ASSUMED THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS. WELL, I THOUGHT THAT... EXCUSE ME. I'M TRULY SORRY. SHE MUST NEVER KNOW THAT I SUSPEC ANY OF THIS. WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK UPON THE MOST DANGEROUS MISSION YET. TO SAVE THE HEIR OF THE THRONE OF FRANCE. FROM THIS MOMENT ON SHE MUST NEVER BE TRUSTED. WE CANNOT RISK BETRAYAL. I ONLY PRAY TO GOD THA I CAN CONCEAL FROM HER THE HORROR I FEEL AT WHAT SHE HAS DONE. HOPE THESE GUARDS CATCH 'EM. THERE'S A GOOD BOY. NOW YOU TAKE YOUR MEDICINE. SAY YOUR PRAYERS FOR THE NICE GENTLEMEN. THEN YOU CAN GO BACK TO BED. WHAT MANNER OF MEDICINE ARE YOU GIVING HIM? NEVER FEAR, CITIZEN, IT'S GOOD, STRONG COGNAC. NOW TAKE IT BOY. YOU KNOW, IT MAKES PAPA DUVAL VERY ANGRY IF YOU DON'T FINISH EVERY DROP. THERE, THAT IS MORE LIKE IT! NOW THESE GENTLEMEN WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOU SAY YOUR CATECHISM. - YOUR NAME: - LOUIS CHARLES CAPET. LET'S HEAR IT: LOUIS CHARLES CAPET. YOUR AGE: EIGHT. YOUR NATIONALITY: CITIZEN OF THE REPUBLIC OF FRANCE. YOUR FATHER'S NAME: LOUIS CAPET. HIS PROFESSION: FORMER KING, TYRANT AND DEBAUCHER. HOW DID HE PERISH: BY THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. WHO WAS YOUR MOTHER: MARIE ANTOINETTE OF AUSTRIA. HER PROFESSION: FORMER QUEEN AND WHORE. HOW DID SHE PERISH: BY THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEIR MEMORIES: - I SPIT UPON THEIR GRAVES. - AGAIN, - I SPIT UPON THEIR GRAVES. - AGAIN! THAT WILL DO. HOWEVER, I STILL DETEC A TRACE OF DEFIANCE IN THOSE ROYAL EYES. KEEP AT IT, FOUQUET. HE MUST BE ALL OURS. SINK ME, WHAT IS THE TIME? WE SHALL BE MONSTROUS LATE AT HIS HIGHNESS' GARDEN PARTY. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T JOIN YOU PERCY, I MUST GET BACK TO THE EMBASSY. CHAUVELIN IS EXPECTING ME. - WHAT NEWS OF THE COURIER? - NONE ODD. YOU MADE INQUIRIES? IT'S TOO DIFFICULT. CHAUVELIN IS BECOMING SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYONE AT THE EMBASSY, INCLUDING ME. YOU HAVE PERFORMED AN INVALUABLE SERVICE TO US THESE PAST FEW MONTHS, ARMAND. WITHOUT YOU, WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ANY IDEA AS TO BOY'S FATE. WHEN I THINK WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO THAT CHILD! WHY? WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO GAIN BY IT? TO RENDER HIM USELESS TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT TRY AND RESCUE HIM. BUT TIME IS RUNNING OUT. WE MUS ACT SOON, OR THEY WILL SUCCEED. HAVE YOU A PLAN? WE WAIT ONLY FOR FIRST THE NEWS OF ANY CHANGE IN THE BOY'S ROUTINE. THAT WILL BE OUR SIGNAL TO MOVE. AND MOVE WE MUST. SWIFTLY AND SURELY. THAT IS WHY THESE COMMUNIQUS FROM PARIS ARE SO CRUCIAL. THE NEXT MAY BE OUR SIGNAL. [DOOR OPENS] AHHHHH, MY DEAR. SHALL WE AWAY? THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF RADNOR. [PEACOCK CRIES ARE HEARD] THE DUKE OF ALBANY AND HIS DAUGHTERS. LADY BRECKNY AND LADY DARLINGTON. [PEACOCK CALL] SIR PERCIVAL AND LADY BLAKENEY. THEY SAY, SHE ONLY MARRIED HIM FOR HIS MONEY. NO WOMAN OF TITLE WOULD HAVE THE IDIOTIC FOP. STILL THEY SEEM... QUITE A HAPPY COUPLE. LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING, MY DEAR. PERCY, FASHIONABLY LATE AS USUAL. SINK ME, YOUR HIGHNESS. 'TWAS THIS DAMNABLE CRAVAT. SIMPLY REFUSED TO TIE. I ASK YOU. LOOK AT THE THING. STICKIN' OUT LIKE A PIN CUSHION. I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN, I WOULD BE SOMETHING SERIOUS. MY HUSBAND IS BEING NOBLE, YOUR HIGHNESS, I FEAR I'M THE ONE TO BLAME. WELL, IN THAT CASE, ALL IS FORGIVEN. [CHUCKLING] NOW THEN, HOW FARES OUR LOVELY FUGITIVE FROM FRANCE? FUGITIVE, YOUR HIGHNESS? SAY, RATHER CAPTIVE. SURELY YOU'RE NOT KEP HERE BY FORCE, MADAME. WHY, YES INDEED. BY THE FORCE OF MY ABIDING LOVE FOR MY HUSBAND, AND BY YOUR HIGHNESS' GOOD FAVORS AND GENEROSITY. GAD, PERCY, BUT I ENVY YOU. YOU'D BETTER KEEP AN EYE ON HER, OTHERWISE I MIGH EXERCISE MY DROIT DE SEIGNEUR, AND STEAL HER AWAY. [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE WHISPERING] MARGUERITE, PERCY! YOU'LL NEVER GUESS! ANDREW HAS ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM AND PAPA HAS GIVEN HIS CONSENT. SINK ME, IF YOU DIDN' GO AND DO IT. - CONGRATULATIONS, OLD CHAP. - THANKS OH, SUZANNE, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. SUZANNE! I FORBID YOU TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT WOMAN. MAMA! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? SHE HAS BLOOD ON HER HANDS. WE HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT SHE DENOUNCED THE MARQUIS DE ST. CYR, AND SENT HIM AND HIS - ENTIRE FAMILY TO THE GUILLOTINE! - MY DEAR COUNTESS, YOU REALLY MUSTN'T... CAN YOU DENY IT, LADY BLAKENEY? I REFUSE TO CONFIRM OR DENY SUCH ACCUSATIONS. THIS IS NO TRAIL, AND YOU ARE NOT JUDGE. TRUE, MADAME. GOD WILL BE YOUR JUDGE. - WILL YOU SAY NOTHING, SIR? - FAITH, MADAME WHAT IS THERE TO SAY? WILL YOU NOT EVEN DEFEND YOUR WIFE'S HONOR? ODDS FISH, MY DEAR, WOULD YOU HAVE ME CHALLENGE THE POOR COUNTESS TO A DUEL? - COME COUNTESS. - THE MUSIC IS ABOUT TO START. - PLEASE SO, MY DEAR, 'TWOULD SEEM YOU FINALLY FOUND A WAY TO REPAY ST. CYR... AFTER ALL. CAN YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT? CAN I...BELIEVE OTHERWISE? OH, BETH,...WHAT CAN I DO? I'VE LOST MY HUSBAND'S LOVE AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. BUT PERCY WORSHIPS THE GROUND YOU WALK ON. ONCE, PERHAPS. BUT NOW HE PLAYS THE FOOL IN PRIVATE AS WELL AS IN PUBLIC. OH, IT SEEMS TO TORMENT ME. THERE ARE TIMES...WHEN I THINK THAT HE STILL LOVES ME. MOMENTS WHEN I CATCH I IN HIS EYES, A LOOK, A GLANCE. WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE HIS DISDAIN? GOODNIGHT, MY DEAR. PLEASANT DREAMS. STAY WITH ME TONIGHT. ODD, MADAME, FAR TOO FATIGUED. BESIDES, I HAVE A VERY EARLY APPOINTMENT IN LONDON, TOMORROW. I DON'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU. YOUR TAILORS, NO DOUBT. BOOT MAKERS, TO BE PRECISE. THESE PINCH SOMETHING MONSTROUS. AND I DONT' MUCH CARE FOR THE BUCKLE. OH, PERCY, WHAT'S BECOME OF YOU? WHERE IS THE MAN I MARRIED. ODDS FISH, MY DEAR, YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT HIM. NO. WHAT I SEE BEFORE ME IS A FACADE. THE SHELL OF A MAN I ONCE KNEW. THERE'S SOME ABSURD ROLE YOU'RE PLAYING. I DON'T KNOW WHY. BUT I'M SURE IT IS. PERHAPS TO KEEP THE WORLD AT A DISTANCE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE SHUTTING ME OUT AS WELL. YOU ONCE PROMISED ME, THA I SHOULD COME TO KNOW THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK, IN TIME. I KNOW HIM LESS NOW THAN I DID THEN. WELL. PERHAPS THERE'S NO MORE TO KNOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT. THE MAN I FELL IN LOVE WITH STILL EXISTS SOMEWHERE. I SHALL NEVER STOP LOVING HIM...NEVER. GOODNIGHT, MY DEAR. FOR SIR ANDREW, TIVERS. VERY GOOD, SIR. AND FOR THE COURIER, WHEN HE ARRIVES. YES SIR. [GUNSHOTS] [CRY] THESE WERE ALL THE PAPERS IN THE COURIERS POUCH? YES, CITIZEN. SO. MY YOUNG ASSISTANT IS IN LEAGUE WITH THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. YOU DID WELL TO INTERCEPT THE COURIER. SEND FOR ARMAND ST. JUST. I FEAR FOR YOU IN PARIS. OH, PERCY, DO PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE UP HIS POST AND STAY HERE. HE COULD SEND FOR LOUISE, THEY COULD GET MARRIED AND LIVE HERE IN ENGLAND. WHAT A DREADFUL PROSPECT. WHAT HAS POOR ARMAND DONE TO BE CONDEMNED TO MATRIMONY? REALLY, PERCY. MUST YOU GO ON TORMENTING HER LIKE THIS? ARE YOU NEVER GOING TO GIVE HER A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN HERSELF? CONSIDER, ARMAND, IF IT IS TRUE THAT SHE BETRAYED ST. CYR, SHE'S CAPABLE OF ALMOS ANY TREACHERY. EVEN SPYING FOR CHAUVELIN. YOU MUST ASK HER. WHAT PROOF HAVE YOU IN ANY OF THIS? NOT ONCE IN ALL THE TIME SHE'S BEEN IN ENGLAND HAS EVEN ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT CHAUVELIN. I DARE NOT RISK IT. NOTHING, NO ONE, IS MORE IMPORTANT THEN THE RESCUE OF THE DAUPHIN AT THIS MOMENT. NOT EVEN MARGUERITE. IT GRIEVES ME TO SEE HER SO UNHAPPY. TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE CEASED TO LOVE HER. CEASED? I SHALL LOVE HER TILL THE DAY I DIE. THAT IS THE TRAGEDY. COME, I SHALL RIDE WITH YOU TO DOVER THERE IS MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. WHY IS CHAUVELIN SENDING YOU TO PARIS NOW? I DON'T LIKE IT. HOWEVER, PERHAPS WITH YOU IN PARIS WE CAN CREATE THE INCIDENT WE NEED TO MAKE OUR MOVE. [DOOR CLOSES] MY, THIS IS INDEED A SURPRISE. NOT TOO UNPLEASANT, I TRUST? I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE YOU CAME TO LONDON. WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE NOW? IT'S A GOOD LIKENESS. ESPECIALLY THE EYES. HE'S CAUGHT THE FLASH AND FIRE OF THE EYES. ALTHOUGH, HE'S MISSED THE SADNESS. SADNESS? APPARENTLY THE ARTIS HAS NOT PERCEIVED WHAT ALL OF LONDON HAS ALREADY GUESSED. AND WHAT MIGH THAT BE? THAT THE LADY IS UNHAPPY IN HER MARRIAGE. A MAN IN YOUR POSITION SHOULD NOT LISTEN TO GOSSIP. LOOK AT ME AND TELL ME, THAT YOU HUSBAND IS MAN ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU HAPPY? HAVE YOU COME HERE TO BE IMPERTINENT? IF THE TRUTH IS IMPERTINENT. YOU'RE A WOMAN OF GREAT PASSION. YOU DESERVE A MAN WHO CAN SATISFY YOUR DESIRES. HUH, AND YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT YOU ARE SUCH A MAN? I WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU ONCE. NEVER QUITE GOOD ENOUGH. NOW, KINDLY STATE YOUR BUSINESS. OR WAS IT YOUR BUSINESS TO SEDUCE THE WIFE OF SIR PERCY BLAKENEY? IN TRUTH, I CAME TO ENLIST YOUR AID. TO HELP ME LEARN THE TRUE IDENTITY OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL? WELL, YOU ASTONISH ME. WHERE IN THE WORLD WOULD I LEARN SUCH A THING? YOU ARE THE PIVO OF SOCIAL LONDON. YOU GO EVERYWHERE. YOU SEE EVERYTHING. AND HEAR EVERYTHING. EASY, MY FRIEND, ARE YOU ASKING ME TO SPY FOR YOU? NO...FOR FRANCE. OH! WHAT YOU PROPOSE IS DEPLORABLE! WHOEVER THE MAN MAY BE, HE'S BRAVE, NOBLE AND COMPASSIONATE. YOU REFUSE, THEN? DID YOU REALLY BELIEVE, THAT I WOULD HELP YOU, AFTER YOU MALICIOUSLY IMPLICATED ME IN THE DEATH OF THE MARQUIS AND HIS FAMILY? I WOULD RATHER GO TO YOUR BELOVED GUILLOTINE. WOULD YOU HAVE YOUR BROTHER GO IN YOUR PLACE? ARMAND, WHAT A JOKE. HE IS IN LEAGUE WITH THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. WHY THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS. I HAVE HERE IRREFUTABLE PROOF, AND I WILL USE IT, UNLESS YOU DO YOUR DUTY AND COOPERATE. THIS IS BLACKMAIL. CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL. I WILL HAVE THE SCARLE PIMPERNEL'S HEAD OR YOUR BROTHER'S! [BREATHING HEAVILY] CONSIDER CAREFULLY. I EXPECT YOUR DECISION THIS EVENING, AT THE LORD GRENVILLE'S BALL. IN THE MEANTIME, I ADVISE YOU TO KEEP SILENT. SAY NOTHING OF THIS TO ANYONE. NOT EVEN TO THAT FOOL YOU CALL YOUR HUSBAND! [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] FORGIVE ME, IF I STARTLED YOU, MADAME. I MUST HAVE BEEN DAYDREAMING. HOW LOVELY YOU LOOK. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE NOTICED ME AT ALL. LOT, MADAME, I'D HAVE TO BE BLIND NOT TO NOTICE. IN THAT GOWN, YOU'LL BE THE BELL OF THE BALL. NOW, TELL ME, WHAT WAS I YOU WERE DREAMING ABOUT, WHEN I CAME IN JUST NOW? PERCY, YOU'VE KNOWN SIR ANDREW FOR A LONG TIME, HAVEN'T YOU? WE WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER, MADAME. WHY DO YOU ASK? I WAS JUST WONDERING IF HE MIGHT NOT BE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. ANDREW? THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL? MOST UNLIKELY, MY DEAR. BUT, TELL ME, WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST IN THE IDENTITY OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL? OH, I HAVE NO MORE INTERES THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN IN LONDON. I WAGER YOUR FRIEND, CHAUVELIN, WOULD GIVE A GREAT DEAL TO KNOW. IF FAITH, I SUSPECT THAT'S THE REASON HE CAME TO ENGLAND. I'M SURPRISED HE HASN' CONFIDED AS MUCH. TO YOU, MY DEAR. TO ME? WHY, I HAVEN'T LAID EYES ON THE MAN SINCE HE ARRIVED. ALTHOUGH, I'M SURE YOU ARE RIGHT. WELL, IF ANYONE'S GOING TO CATCH THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL IT WILL NOT BE CHAUVELIN. AND WHY IS THAT? WHY? ODDS FISH, MY DEAR, THE MAN CAN'T EVEN TIE HIS OWN CRAVAT. REALLY, PERCY, IS THA ALL YOU THINK ABOUT? WHY AREN'T YOU THE KIND OF MAN A WOMAN CAN LOOK UP TO? TURN TO IN TROUBLE. TROUBLE, MY DEAR? ARE YOU IN TROUBLE? AND IF I WERE? WHY YOU MIGHT TRY CONFIDING IN ME, AS ONCE YOU USED TO. WHAT'S THE USE. WE DON'T EVEN SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE ANYMORE. [BELL RINGS] [DOOR OPENS] PARDON, MADAME. - THE COURIER? - MURDERED. - COME WITH ME, CHIVERS. - YES, SIR. THERE CAN BE NO DOUB CHAUVELIN KNOWS ABOUT ARMAND. HE MUST BE WARNED. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS NOTE TO LORD DEWHURST, AT ONCE. TELL HIM TO GIVE IT TO SIR ANDREW AT THE BALL, AND THEN DESTROY IT.

THAT DAMNED, ELUSIVE, PIMPERNEL. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] OH, THIS IS COMMENDABLE, PERCY. IT REALLY IS MOST COMMENDABLE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT.

YOUR FRIEND SIR ANDREW FFOULKES HAS A NOTE TUCKED IN HIS SLEEVE. FIND OUT WHAT IT SAYS. BUT, HOW? I LEAVE THAT TO YOUR INGENUITY AS A CONSUMMATE ACTRESS. YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD BE DANCING WITH HER YOURSELF, MY DEAR FELLOW. YOU'LL FORGIVE ME, SIR, BUT I DO FIND THE MINUE RATHER TEDIOUS. IN THAT CASE, WHAT ABOU THAT GAME OF HAZARD YOU PROMISED ME? SPLENDID, BUT I MUS WARN YOU, SIR. I DO FEEL DEVILISH LUCKY TONIGHT. DAMNATION, UH, HUH. PRAY, TAKE YOUR PLACES FOR THE ALLEMANDE. YOU MUSTNT MONOPOLIZE HIM, SUZANNE, OTHERWISE EVERYONE WILL THINK YOU'RE AFRAID HE'LL STRAY. COME ALONG, ANDREW. WHEW! OH! AH. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - [GASP] - MARGUERITE! I THINK IT'S JUST THE HEAT. OH! THANK YOU, ANDREW. [SIGH] I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME. PERHAPS I'LL FETCH PERCY. NO, DON'T LEAVE ME. I ONLY NEED TO CLOSE MY EYES FOR A MOMENT OR TWO. [WHOOH] [SIGH] AHHHH. HOW CLEVER OF YOU.

ONE MOMENT MORE, AND I MIGH HAVE KNOWN THE LADY'S NAME. LADY? OR A DUCHESS, PERHAPS? FOR SHAME, ANDREW. ENTERTAINING LOVE NOTES FROM SECRET ADMIRERS BEHIND SUZANNE'S BACK. WHAT WILL SHE SAY? THERE WAS ONLY A FRAGMEN LEFT BY TIME I GOT AT IT. COULD YOU MAKE ANYTHING OUT? IT SAID, 'WE LEAVE FOR FRANCE TONIGHT. MEET ME IN THE LIBRARY AT MIDNIGH FOR YOU INSTRUCTIONS.' AND THE SIGNATURE? HOW WAS IT SIGNED? NOT SIGNED. IT WAS ONLY THE SYMBOL OF A SMALL FLOWER. THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. IN THE LIBRARY, AT MIDNIGHT. YOU'VE DONE WELL, MY DEAR, VERY WELL, INDEED.

WHY DID YOU COME? TO WARN YOU. CHAUVELIN KNOWS THAT YOU'LL BE IN THIS ROOM AT MIDNIGHT. YOU TOLD HIM? I HAD TO. TO SAVE MY BROTHER. HE THREATENED TO HAVE ARMAND ARRESTED UNLESS I HELPED HIM TO DISCOVER YOUR IDENTITY. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS NOW? BECAUSE I COULD NEVER LIVE WITH MYSELF KNOWING THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DEATH. WHAT IS ONE MORE LIFE TO YOU? YOU ALREADY HAVE THE MARQUIS DE ST. CYR AND HIS FAMILY TO YOUR CREDIT. THAT'S NOT TRUE! CHAUVELIN DECEIVED ME, BECAUSE I SPURNED HIM FOR ANOTHER. HE MALICIOUSLY PUT MY NAME ON THE ARREST WARRANT AS INFORMER. I COULD NEVER HAVE SEN THE MARQUIS AND HIS FAMILY TO THEIR DEATHS, ANYMORE THAN I CAN NOW LET YOU DIE BECAUSE OF ME. IF THIS IS TRUE, YOU ARE A VERY BRAVE WOMAN FOR COMING HERE. I'M A FOOL. IF CHAUVELIN FOUNDS OUT, IT COULD COST MY BROTHER'S LIFE. NO HARM WILL EVER COME TO YOUR BROTHER, AS LONG AS I LIVE. CAN I BELIEVE THAT? I GIVE YOU...MY WORD. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WON'T YOU TELL ME? A PHANTOM, MY LADY, NOTHING MORE THAN A PHANTOM. NO. YOU'RE VERY REAL TO ME. AS REAL AS LIFE ITSELF.

MY YACHT IS ANCHORED AT DOVER, AND WE MUST SAIL WITH THE TIDE. UH, WHAT SHALL I TELL MARGUERITE? TELL HER I LOVE HER, MORE THAN EVER. PAUL, YOU'RE LEAVING. DOES THAT MEN YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL?

I'M NOT SO SURE EITHER IS TRUSTWORTHY. I HEAR THE MAN IS IN DEBT, AND THAT MAKES HIM RIPE FOR BRIBERY. BRIBERY? WELL, THOSE BENT ON RESCUING THE BOY, WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY HANDSOMELY. DUVAL AND HIS WIFE WILL BE REPLACED - AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. - COME ON. VERY WISE. DEATH, ROBBING MY EYES OF LIGHT, WILL GIVE BACK TO THE SUN IT'S UNTARNISHED PURITY! [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] A WORD, MY FRIEND. AH, WILL IT WAIT? - MADEMOISELLE LONGET... - I HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION, THAT CHAUVELIN HAS SEN A SECRET COMMUNIQU FROM LONDON CONCERNING YOU. CONCERNING ME? CHAUVELIN KNOWS THAT YOU ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. I? IN LEAGUE WITH THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL? OH, REALLY, BARON, SOMEONE HAS BEEN TEASING YOU. AH, YOU'RE PLAYING A VERY DANGEROUS GAME, MONSIEUR ARMAND ST. JUST. NOW, WHY NOT TELL YOUR SCARLET PIMPERNEL TO LEAVE THE RESCUE OF THE DAUPHIN TO THE FRENCH LOYALISTS? AFTER ALL, THEY HAVE A FAR MORE LEGITIMATE CLAIM TO HIM THAN IF I KNEW THE IDENTITY OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, AND I DO NOT, HE WOULD LAUGH IN MY FACE. HE MUST KNOW YOU WAN THE BOY FOR YOURSELF. I? SO THAT YOU CAN COLLEC THE GOLD THAT AWAITS YOU IN VIENNA, WHEN YOU DELIVER THE HEIR TO THE FRENCH THRONE TO YOUR AUSTRIAN FRIENDS. HM? AND DID THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL TELL YOU THAT? OF COURSE NOT. HE'S NOT EVEN IN PARIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORD OF WARNING, BARON. AND NOW, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I DON'T LIKE TO KEEP MADEMOISELLE LONGET WAITING. [POUNDING ON DOOR] OPEN, IN THE NAME OF THE REPUBLIC. THE VERY IDEA. DISTURBING DECENT CITIZENS WITH ALL THAT NOISE. WHERE IS MADEMOISELLE LONGET? WHERE ELSE WOULD SHE BE AT HIS UNGODLY HOUR? IN HER BOUDOIR. WHY, IT'S ALFONSE PONCEAU! FORGIVE ME MY DEAR, BUT HE INSISTED. THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT, AUNT LULU. MONSIEUR PONCEAU AND I ARE OLD FRIENDS.

THE WARRANT WAS SIGNED BY CITIZEN CHAUVELIN, HIMSELF, WHEN HE RETURNED FROM LONDON THIS VERY MORNING. HE MEANS TO ARREST HIS OWN SUPERIOR? A MAN AS IMPORTANT AS CITIZEN ROBESPIERRE? SUPERIOR? DID YOU SAY YOU WERE HERE TO ARREST LOUIS ST. JUST? LOUIS ST. JUST? I AM HERE TO ARREST ARMAND ST. JUST. SEE HERE. OH, THAT EXPLAINS IT. THE GENTLEMAN IN MY BOUDOIR IS NOT ARMAND ST. JUST, BU LOUIS, HIS DISTINGUISHED COUSIN. DID YOU SAY, THAT IN THAT ROOM AT THIS MOMENT, SLEEPS ONE OF THE MOS POWERFUL MEN IN FRANCE? WELL, IF THAT IS THE PERSON YOU WISH, SHALL I GO... NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. WHY DISTURB THE CITIZEN IF HE'S ASLEEP. I'LL JUS LEAVE, QUIETLY. NO NEED EVEN TO MENTION THIS LITTLE INCIDENT. SUCH A BUSY MAN. SO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS ON HIS MIND. PLEASE, [GASP], JUST PRETEND I WAS HERE ON A MISUNDERSTANDING, THAT IS ALL. COME ALONG, YOU IDIOTS. YOU WERE WONDERFUL. WHEN HE REALIZES HIS MISTAKE THEY'LL BE BACK. YOU MUST LEAVE PARIS IMMEDIATELY. NOT WITH A FEAR. YOU'RE COMING WITH ME TO ENGLAND. BE READY AT MIDDAY TOMORROW, AND I'LL RETURN TO FETCH YOU THEN. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. THEY'LL BE WATCHING THE HOUSE. NOW GO! NO. NOT THAT WAY. THEY'LL BE WATCHING THE HOUSE. USE THE ROOF. TILL MIDDAY. IMBECILE! LOUIS ST. JUS IS AS CELIBATE AS A MONK. I DOUBT IF HE'S SLEPT WITH HIS OWN WIFE IN TEN YEARS. SHE'S TAKEN YOU FOR THE FOOL YOU ARE. I SHALL RETURN AT ONCE AND MAKE THE ARREST. OH, HE'S LONG GONE BY NOW. - BUT THE... - I'LL HANDLE THIS MYSELF. - BUT HE... - PONCEAU - BUT I REALLY... - GET OUT!

SO...AT LONG LAST, WE CAN MAKE OUR MOVE. THANKS TO YOU, MY DEAR ARMAND. NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY. THE BOY WILL BE BROUGH TO THE RENDEZVOUS POIN OUTSIDE PARIS...HERE, WHERE ARMAND WILL BE WAITING, PRECISELY AT MIDDAY. THE TIMING IS CRUCIAL. ONE SLIP...AND WE CAN HAVE HALF THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCE OF FRANCE ON OUR HEELS. FROM THERE, HE WILL BE TAKEN TO THE TRANSFER POINT, WHERE TONY WILL BE WAITING WITH THE HORSES.
