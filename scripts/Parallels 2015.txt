[GRUNTS] [] [GRUNTS] Do you know your name? RONAN: Ronan Carver. Do you know where you are, Ronan? Akron, Ohio. United States. Earth. No sign of head trauma. I think he'll live. Thanks, doc. Let me ask you a question. Are you a fighter? You just saw me fight. I just saw you lose. Most fighters go out there, they go out there to win. But there's a certain kind of guy who gets into the ring who doesn't care about winning. This certain kind of guy, he just wants to smash himself up against the world, just to see what's left over. What are you doing, fighting all these back alley matches? Living out of a bag. Don't you belong somewhere? [] [CELL PHONE BUZZING] Aw... [SCOFFS] [SIGHS] [IN DISTORTED VOICE] Ronan. It's Dad. You need to come home immediately. You must get to the building by 6:19 p.m. on Sunday, exactly. It's 156 Prospect. Come home now. [] RONAN: Yo, Dad, it's me again. You know, for a guy who haven't called in two years, you sure got lousy phone etiquette. Look, I'm here like you asked. I'll find my own way home. [] Dad! [KEYS CLATTER] Dad! [SIGHS] Jesus, B. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't know you were here. Nice face. Oh, I had a fight. Mm. Well, not a-- I didn't have a f-- I had a match. I'm a professional-ish fighter. Is he still living here? Moved out a couple months ago. Cool. Ronan, what are you doing here? I just came to see Dad, okay? I'm not trying-- Well, is he home? No. No. What, you haven't seen him? No, not recently, but, you know, even when dad's here, he's not really here. Ever since mom died. [SIGHS] Look... Dad left me a message. I'm just-- Me too. Wait, really? Wh-- What did yours say? It was weird. Yeah, right? It kind of freaked me out. Mine was about a building. "Get to the building." Same. Do you have any idea what that means? No idea. [SIGHS] Did you check the whole house? Is he in there? No. Check the trunk. Why? What if he's, you know, stuffed in there? Heh. Why would you even put that in my head? I'm just covering all of our bases. WOMAN: Harold! HAROLD: I said I'll be right back! WOMAN: I need my feet scraped! HAROLD: Stop screaming. You sound like a lunatic! I don't sound like a lunatic! You sound like a-- Look what you're wearing. It's a translucent gown. [CHUCKLES] WOMAN: Go! HAROLD: Go back in the house, Ma! Hey! Hey, Beatrix! Hey! He still lives here? Be nice. She's just... [MIMICKING A BOMB WHISTLING THEN EXPLODING] Hey, Harry. Hey. Ronan. Harold. Actually, it's Harry now, ever since I graduated law school. What-- Are you a lawyer now? Well, public defender, actually. You know, just fighting the power. You know, taking care of honest people. What about you? What's new? I got into Princeton. What? RONAN: Oh, B, that's-- That's awesome. Yeah, I just got the acceptance letter last night. And I know it's like three years behind, and I'll be the only freshman who can order beer. But better never too late to start, right? Wow, congratulations. That's fanta-- Princeton. Well, just-- I'm a little surprised I didn't read anything about that. No update or anything on Facebook. What about me? You like to check my updates too? We're not Facebook friends, Ronan. I don't have a Facebook. Hey, Harry. Have you seen my dad? Has he been around recently? Yeah, I've seen him around. You know, no actual interaction, but he's not exactly the friendliest person in the world. Why? He's missing. Really? Huh. What? Nothing, I just-- I-- I saw some guys at his house last night. I thought I heard yelling. Hard to tell over my mom's yelling. What--? What guys? I don't know. Guys. With my father? Yeah, with your dad. Why are we in the garage? Wanted to make sure my dad wasn't in there. Did you check the trunk? That's what I said. Oh, my God, there's nothing in the trunk. [] Looks like Dad's jump bag. Yep. His what? His jump bag. Like if you have to get out of town in a hurry. HAROLD: Is he a drug lord? Why does he need a jump bag? BEATRIX: You remember how he was always traveling for work? He was hardly ever around when we were kids. [CLICKING] What is this? [] RONAN: What is that? I don't know. Whoa. [BEEPS] Whoa. What happened? RONAN: You didn't see that? It's like it just turned on. Ronan. RONAN: Wait, am I crazy or--? BEATRIX: No. Clinton's still alive. This has gotta be a joke, right? I think we should call the police. Come on, B. The police, seriously? I'm a public defender. I am down with a lot of cops. Shut up, Harold. Dad could be on a trip. Who, our dad? Who hasn't left the house in three years? So he's back. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Not for long, hopefully. Well, look, he is your brother. You're more like a brother to me than he is. Yeah. No, that's exactly how I feel about you. Thank you. Okay. Heh. I need my feet scraped! Oh, for the love of God. Hey, hey, hey. Hold up. What? Take me with you. STONE: Look, I like to help you, kids, but here's my problem: What, we're talking a 50-, 55-year-old man? Grown-ups are allowed to go missing. But he called us. Did he seem in distress? Not exactly. He wanted us to come home. Was there anything in the house that suggested a break-in or a struggle? No. Okay, here's my problem here. You don't have anything that's actionable for me. There's nothing obviously illegal going on. My dad wouldn't go missing like that. Look, I can put his description out, then have our patrol cars keep an eye out for him. Right now, that's the best I can do. Okay. He mentioned a building. 156 Prospect. STONE: That's downtown. It's been empty for years. There's nothing there. Right. Okay. Well, thank you, Captain Stone. Appreciate it. [] I don't think you can park here, Ronan. I think I just did, law school. Why are you still here? Moral support. [] What are you doing? Dad said to meet at the building, not in it. Why are you being so weird? Let's just go inside. Well, I'll go in. Oh. [SIGHS] Dad! Shh! Ugh... What? Jesus. What if you wake up some crazy homeless guy or raccoons or something? I'm not afraid of a homeless guy. I'm a little afraid of raccoons. Don't worry, Beatrix, I got your back. That's nice, Harold. Thanks. [GROANS] Either of you guys ever heard of a Dragon Burger? [] HAROLD: This is weird. "On my Earth, terrorists flew planes into the Twin Towers on October 23rd, 2001." "Avoid Earth 33, the contagion has spread." HAROLD: "Earth 468 is safe, locals are friendly. No weapons." "Found an Earth where all babies are born as twins." "Earths 53, 181, and 726 are all extinct." RONAN: "What is Earth 1?" [THUDDING] [CREAKING] RONAN: What's happening? [ALARM BLARING] What the hell is that? I don't know. [] Ronan. Shit. [BEATRIX GRUNTS] [GASPING] Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where are we? What's happening? Oh, my God. BEATRIX: Where are we? HAROLD: Oh. my God. What is this? What is this? Do--? Did we get nuked? No, no, we'd be dead. BEATRIX: No, no, no. A whole city can't just disappear like that. Then where is everybody, huh? Where is everyone? Where--? Where is everything? Where are the buildings? Look. The buildings are gone! Everything is gone! [GASPING] Our building is fine. [] How was that possible? Our building... Exactly the same. Guys. This happened a long time ago. This is old. It's grown over. It's... Hey. Ronan. Hey! B. Hey! Can you help us? Stay back! Can you tell us where we are? Leave us the hell alone! Leave us the hell alone! Whoa. MAN: Go. Go. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. I just can't breathe. I can't breathe very well. MAN 1: Stay back. No, no. MAN 2: Come on, let's go. All right? Come on, let's go! [GUNFIRE] [BEATRIX GASPS] Let's get back inside. Back inside. [] HAROLD: Ah! Everything's gone. Come on. [BOTH PANTING] [HAROLD COUGHING] Yeah, they went into the building. HAROLD: They're not following us. Why aren't they following us? Maybe they're afraid. HAROLD: They're walking away. That's-- That's good, right? I feel like we were running pretty fast on that-- That one. I don't-- Haven't ran that fast in a while. Why did Dad send us here? I don't know. I mean, maybe we weren't, uh, supposed... to go to the-- I-- I don't know. Maybe it's a mistake. No. I mean, no, it-- It can't be a mistake. He sent us to this exact address at that exact time. Dad wanted us to come here. Where is here? I-- I-- Well, I have a theory. What? You're not gonna like my theory. It's better than the theory we have, which is no theory. Well, not necessarily. I mean, a terrible theory could be worse than no theory. Harold, just tell us the theory. Okay. Just look at all this graffiti of different Earths, different... Histories, different worlds. Okay, what about it? It's all bullshit. Yeah, right, right. But what if it's not? What if all of these Earths are equally real? What if we are on Earth now, just... another version of it? WOMAN: Actually... I'm-- [GASPS] that's sounds kind of right. [SIGHS] I take it this is your first trip through the building. Where did you come from? The building is pretty big. There's lots of different ins and outs. I'm Polly. Ronan. Beatrix. Harold. Harry. Well, you guys are all really polite. Okay, you said that he was about right. What did you mean by that? You guys got on on that last Earth, right? That one with your Internet and your fancy phones and your lattes? That's just sitting right where you left it. This Earth, on the other hand, this Earth looks nuked to shit. This Earth? Yeah. You hit them every once in a while. It's usually some U.S.-Soviet thing from the '70s or '80s. Sometimes you get China, Pakistan in there. I saw Egypt cause it once. That was a weird Earth. I mean, this is just assuming that you're working off more or less the same 20th Century, so-- How many Earths are there? I don't know. Nobody knows. Some people think every possible Earth exists. So like, out there somewhere, there's an Earth that is exactly like your Earth, just with one less mosquito. Some people think that there is an Earth that's so perfect, it's basically heaven. Yes, nerd in front? When can we go home? This building jumps every 36 hours. So we have got 32 hours to kill. Till then, there's nothing to do but wait. But you guys have to be back for the jump. If you miss the jump, then... Well, you might not get another chance. Then how would we get home? That, my friend, is the Big Danny. The what? The Bi-- Oh, nothing. It's something from TV when I was a kid. What show? Game of Your Life. You've never heard of it. What channel? We didn't have channels on my Earth. You're saying you're from some weird alternate Earth? Not from my point of view. You guys are the ones who are drinking coffees that look like ice cream sundaes and shit. But what are we supposed to do for next 32 hours? Just wait? My advice, in a world like this, is that you shut up and you stay hidden. And, you know, try not to die. [] Peach? [SIGHS] [] [GUNS COCKING] Tell the chief we found them. [] HAROLD: Mom. Mom! [] [] [MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN 1: All right, come on. Let's go, let's go. On your feet. Come on, let's go. MAN 2: Let's go. Let's get this stuff. Take them to my factory. Come on. [] MAN 3: Hey, chief. Found this folks in Old Town. They were in the building. And you went inside? Tinker said. Goddamn it. He's supposed to be here getting this power up and running. What were you folks doing in the building, son? Oh, hey, ha, we were just passing through. I'm sorry, my friend here is a mute. Childhood fever, you know. He's not all there. From where? Kansas. To? East. Maybe north. Uh, we're not sure. Why did you folks run in the building? It looked like a safe place to hide. From who? From your men. We saw them gun down two people. What'd I tell you about that shit? They drew on us. The building is a very dangerous place. We avoid it. We didn't know that. Look, I'm sorry for waylaying you. We've been having some problems with some folks up north. I wouldn't head that way if I were you. Mike here will take you out of town if you like. Thank you, Captain Stone. STONE: Wait. [] How'd you know I was police? Nobody knows that. You just-- You look like a guy with authority. How'd you know my name was Stone? [STUTTERING] Strong features. Who are you people? Where are you from? TINKER: They came from the building. I told you. Remember the last time somebody came out of that building? I don't need this shit now. It was him. The man who brought the nuke here. The man who murdered two-thirds of this city came from the building. STONE: That doesn't make sense. You've been up and down that building a million times. Look at them. They're not from here. Where are you from? We're from Kansas. Not you. Where? Kansas. East or west? East? TINKER: Who controls east Kansas, huh? Okay, who controls west Kansas? Who was the president when the bombs hit? What was the first city that got hit? What nation are we in? The United States of America. TINKER: I rest my case. STONE: What are you saying? What if they got a bomb? If they had a bomb, we'd be dead already. We haven't used ours yet. We don't have a bomb. Says the mute. What do you suggest? TINKER: Leave them with me. I'll find out everything. Hey! Ugh! POLLY: Told you. You try telling people you're from an alternate universe, somehow it never goes very well. BEATRIX: I can't believe this. Yeah, I could-- I could be home watching television. You'd be home scraping your mom's feet. Yeah, well, right now, that sounds pretty great. [METAL CLANGING] [] Which one you want, Tinker? Let's take this one and the little one. RONAN: You don't touch her. No, no, no. The big one. HAROLD: Wait. Wait. Wait, wait. Wait. Please, don't take her. RONAN: Get off! Please, take me. Please! [POLLY CLICKING TONGUE] Tick tock. [] What do you--? Ronan. B. You get your hands off her! Hey. Let's go. RONAN: Where are you taking us? Get off me! [BEATRIX WHIMPERING] No! B. Get off! BEATRIX: No! Don't! Ronan. Ronan! MAN: Bitch. RONAN: B. B! BEATRIX: Ronan. B. [PANTING] Hey! Okay. [GRUNTING] Aah! You fuckers! Ronan, that's not gonna help anything. Aah! Ronan, stop it! That's not gonna help anything, Ronan! Stop it! How do you know? Because I remember how mom died. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-- Forget it. [] Why did you leave us, Ronan? After Mom died, you just left. I had to. Why? Because I had to protect you. Protect me from what? From me. What? From me. Because I don't know if you didn't notice, but everything that I'm around gets hurt. Ronan, you left me alone. I had to take care of things by myself. I had to take care of Dad by myself. I don't need your protection. What I needed was my older brother. You're not understanding what I'm s-- I want you to know, when I get out of here, I'm knocking you clear out. Good to know. Thanks. What's your name? They call me Tinker. Is that your real name? I'm Beatrix. That's my brother, Ronan. Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you. Come on over here and shake my hand. Beatrix. Yes. Good tactic. Try to befriend your captor, make them see you as a real human being. Is it working? No. Well, what do you do here, Tinker? I make things. Repair things. A little surgery now and then. It's a bit messy for my taste. What I truly love are electronics, when I can get my hands on them. Unfortunately finding anything in good shape is so very rare. You see, this used to be a nice place till the nukes got loose. Pakistan collapsed in '99. That's when the black market was flooded. Bombs the size of suitcases. After that, it just seemed like it was a matter of time. Sooner or later, there'd be a mushroom cloud over New York City. Only New York wasn't the first to go. We were. Jesus. I happened to be out of town at the time. But my wife and daughter were at home, just outside the blast zone. So instead of being killed instantly, they likely died excruciating deaths from thermal radiation. Since then, I've learned a lot more about nukes. [] I pieced this one together from three duds. People here are scared shitless of it. That's a nuke? That's right. And the man... who first brought the nukes here, the man that murdered my wife and daughter, he came out of that building. So the question is, who is the man from the building? I don't know. Who is the man from the building? I-- I don't-- I don't know. Who is he? I don't know! I swear, I-- I don't know! [] Who is the man from the building? Oh, my God. Who is he? Who is he? That's my father. HAROLD: Can I ask you a question? How many other worlds have you been to exactly? Um, it's not what you should be thinking about right now. No? What the hell should I be thinking about then? You should be thinking about the fact that, um-- That there's another you somewhere out there, who is, you know, lying on a beach, sipping a mai tai. A whole other you. One who is not about to get a bullet in his head within the hour. One of the problems we have in this world is the problem of bullets. There are so darn many different kinds. You can have boxes and boxes full of bullets, yet not one bullet will fit your gun. Well, I've solved that problem. I modified the barrel to resize itself. Now I can load almost any size bullet. [WHIRRING] And... In, oh, five seconds or so... [GUNSHOT] [GASPING] TINKER: Of course, there is one big minus: I can only load one bullet at a time. Nonetheless, given the right problem, this is the correct solution. Now, I'm gonna ask you some questions. Every time I ask you a question, I load a bullet. If you haven't answered the question by the time the gun is ready to fire, I'm gonna put a bullet in your brother. What? What? Do you understand? You only have a few seconds. Do you understand? Yes. No! Oh! You're crazy! Now, where do you come from? We're from a... Uh, a different Earth. Explain. Um, I-- I don't know how, um... [GUN WHIRRING] If the bomb never went off, none of this ever happened? You came through the building? Yes. What is the building? I don't know. What is the building? I don't know! I swear to God. We just went in and it dropped us here! No! I'm gonna kill you! I swear to God I'm gonna kill you! How does it work? How is it powered? Who's in control? I don't know! Who's in charge? Who runs the building? I don't know any of that! Bullshit! BEATRIX: No! Please! Who's your father? And why did he bring the nuke here? I don't know! Why did he kill my family? Stop pointing that at my brother! Why? Okay. Okay. Okay, you know what? I'll tell you everything you want to know. Liar. [GUNSHOT] [TINKER GASPING] [] [THUDDING] Holy shit. [GRUNTING] [CHUCKLES] [KEYS JINGLING] Do you think that stuff he said about Dad was true? Who the hell is dad? [] Oh, my God. [BEEPING] What are you doing? Get-- What? You're too late. Ah! My God, he armed it. [BEEPING] Let's go. He armed it. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on! We might not make it out of here, you know. Yeah. True. Which means that this could be our last few hours left of life. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well, what do you wanna do? You know, with the last few hours of life we've got left? I-- I don't... What do you think? Are you--? Are you messing with me right now? [BLOW LANDS, BODY FALLS] Oh-- Oh, just-- We gotta go right now. BEATRIX: Come on. Let me just-- Now. [] [TIRES SCREECH] So where did they go? I don't know, chief. [SIGHS] Now we find ourself in this goddamn mess. Shit! [BEEPING] I know what the building is. Jesus Christ. Somebody help Tinker get cleaned up. Not necessary! I'm gonna blow the building off the face of the map and anything within a 5-mile radius. Oh, the hell you are. Actually I am. In about 29 minutes. You shut it down. No. I'm gonna take this bomb, and I'm heading towards the building, thataway. The rest of you, if you wanna live, I suggest you go the other way. One other thing. Chief, I need to borrow a truck. [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [] [ENGINE DIES] RONAN: Fuck. Shit. [] We ran out of gas? Really? I'm sorry. I didn't see a gas station on the way. No, come on, guys, we can walk from here. Yeah, tell that to the roving assassin squads. Guys! Come on, we gotta haul ass. The building doesn't wait. [SIGHS] [] Run with them, inside. Inside. Go, go, go! [] I got you. [] POLLY: And five, four, three, two, one. [ALARM BEEPING] Well? What happened? Why aren't we jumping? We will, we will. Any second. HAROLD: Any second? You said 36 hours. Roughly, yeah. Roughly? Oh, come on. Come on! [BEEPING] [] HAROLD: Hurry up, hurry up, please. B, I'm sorry. For what? Everything. [BEEPING] [] [GRUNTS] HAROLD: Come on! [ALARM BLARING] Okay. All right. Okay. Lights, lights. [BEEPING] Let's do it. Let's do it. Come on. [] HAROLD: Come on! [EXPLOSION] [] [GRUNTS] Are you okay? Yeah. You? Yeah. BEATRIX: Harold, are you okay? Yeah. Are we home? Home? You thought you were going home? Where else would we be going? I thought you understood. There is no going home. [] RONAN: What, is this future? No, it's not the future. I told you guys the building doesn't time travel. It's still the exact same day, exact same time. You don't even have to adjust your watch. It's just a different Earth, is all. Oh, yeah, no big deal. Just a completely different Earth. So we're stuck here. POLLY: It's not so bad. I mean, the tech is decent. HAROLD: Decent? This is 20 years more advanced than we are. All right, we should look for Dad. How? I don't know, B. I'm just kind of making this up as I go. Maybe we could look him up online. I'm sure they have Internet here, right? Let's go to the house. How do we know he's even living there? How do we know he's not? B, we gotta start somewhere. You know? Let's split up. Is that okay? Is that okay? I don't know. Are you guys, like, 5? Yeah. And I could go with you, Beatrix. Yeah. Look, I'll just, uh-- I'll text you. What's your--? What's your number? Yeah, I am pretty sure you don't have a cell phone plan in this universe, pal. Right, yeah. All right, guys, here's the deal. Batteries, cash, ammo, it's gonna change from world to world. The only thing that matters is you guys make it back here before this gets to zero. So don't be late unless you wanna make this your permanent residence, okay? I can live with that. What were their names again? Seriously? That's Beatrix, and that dweeb there is Harold. And Beatrix is your girlfriend, right? No. She's my sister. Right. I mean, I'm-- What was your name again? Ronan. What, did you get hit in the head? [] RONAN: Yes. I'm starving. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. What--? So, what's good? What do you got? Crombie. Okay, what's a crombie? Crombie is a crombie. That's all we got. Okay, two crombies then. Whatever those are. Heh. [MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY OVER SPEAKERS] Huh. Whoa. Look at that thing. This world is so much better than ours. I want it. Harold. Harold. COMPUTER: Hello, welcome. Do you realize how insane this is? I buy this, take it back home, sell it to Apple? Instant billionaire. Can you do that? Yeah. Why not? Well, I don't know. It just seems like it's kind of cheating. [SCOFFS] Tell it to my yacht. Harry. Harold. Sir. CLERK: That's 699. Got that. This is an opportunity, Beatrix, and I am seizing it. There's nothing wrong about it. And, look, you play your cards right, maybe you and I can split the profits. What am I supposed to do with this? Run it. Dude, bio only. What? So why are you looking for your dad? I mean, my dad and I didn't have the best relationship, but he wouldn't just hide from me, if that's what you mean. You never know who people really are. Why haven't you seen him? Just, after my mom died we kind of went separate ways. I'm really different from my family, you know. They're all smart, and I'm just, uh... My mom was a professor, my dad's an engineer. I mean, B is going to Princeton. And I'm a human punching bag. It's a good thing I got a thick skull, though, huh? I think you act dumber than you really are. WOMAN: All right, here we go, okay? Two crombies. RONAN: What is this? Okay. WOMAN: You gotta pay. Right here. [WOMAN CLEARS THROAT] What? Put your hand on the scanner. What's it gonna do to my hand? It's a biometric scanner. It takes the money straight out of your account. Really? Yes. Hey, you know what? Thank you for your help, we're actually just gonna go. Come on. Well... [WHIRRING] BEATRIX: Oh, my God. That person looks just like you. Oh, my God, it does look like me. That's me. That's so weird. HAROLD: Right. He's got my face. It's the same face. Look. We're not from around here. It says you live five blocks away. Right. I know. I just-- I just mean we're not from right here. Dude, you've shopped here before. HAROLD: Ha, ha, ha. I know. What's my address again? [BEEPING] You're not in the system. Everybody's in the system. RONAN: Whoa, come on. Just take your time. Not like I don't have a job. Would you like to come up here and pay for my meal? What does that mean? There ain't no Ronan Carver on this Earth. Either you're dead, or you never existed. We should go. Yeah, but I'm starving. Hey! On some Earths, this is where they call the cops. Come on. Come on, let's go find your dad. MAN: Do you mind? I'm a doctor, right. Hey, give me both of his crombies. [BEEPING] COMPUTER: Hello, welcome. I would like to purchase your electronics, please. Which electronics? All of them. [] MAN: Are you kidding me? $60,000 worth of electronics? Why the hell would I buy all that crap? It's goddamn identify theft, I'm telling you. Hey, this is it. This is where I live. This is where we've been walking this whole time? Harold, I don't have time for this. I have to go out and find my dad or at least try to find out how to find my dad. Come on, this is-- We're right here. Look, I must've a laptop or something up there. You can look him up online. What if we go and then you answer the door? [SIGHS] It'd be a little weird, but I gotta give it a shot, right? Wouldn't you? I don't know about this. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Maybe I'm not home. [BEEPS] [DOOR UNLOCKS] Well, I guess you're home now. [] Hello? Shh. No way. Look at this place. I hate other Harold. BEATRIX: What? Why? Well, he seems much more awesome than me. Oh, come on, you're awesome. He's traveled. I bet other Harold hasn't been to an alternate nuked-out Earth. Yeah, but I mean he's got a nice apartment. Yeah, but your mom's place... Okay, yeah, I say what you're saying. [SIGHS] Yeah. Well, hello. [COMPUTER WHIRS] Hey, Harold, what is your password? I wanna Google my dad or Shmoogle him or whatever they do here. How am I gonna know what his password is? Well, because he's you. No, it's a different me. What if he's a fan of some huge movie here that we've never even heard of? What if he's exactly the same? No, no. It's not gonna work. Harry, please. Okay. I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important. It's Beatrix928. What? My password. Beatrix928. [] Why 928? It's your birthday. Right. Duh. No. Yeah. Oh, God. We are the same. [DOORBELL RINGS] I feel like I should explain right now that this doesn't usually go over very well. Why not? I don't know. It's like, "Ding dong. What's up? I'm your nonexistent son. Don't worry, I can explain. I'm from a totally different parallel alternate universe. I don't think your key is gonna fit in that lock. Touch. RONAN: Hello? Guess nobody's home. [SIGHS] So, uh, what happens after you find your dad? I don't know. I'd give him this thing that he left for me. What thing? [] Where did you get that? What, you know what it is? I don't know what it is, but I know where it came from. That came from the Core World. I don't believe it. I'm an asshole. What? Look at me. I'm a corporate scumbag lawyer. I'm sure there's more to it than that. I mean, this you is a good person, right? Yeah. Yes, I just-- I can't believe that I'd be capable of something like this. No wonder I can afford this place. Oh, my God. HAROLD: What? I found my dad. Okay. He died three months ago. Oh, well, that's this world's version of him. It's not your dad. Yeah, I know, but still... HAROLD: How did he die? Killed at work. Wait a second. Isn't that--? That's the building. What the hell? POLLY: Where do you think the building came from? I haven't really had a second to think about it. Nobody knows where the building came from. But the building is always the same. Every single universe. Everywhere on every Earth, the building is always the same. But it didn't just appear out of thin air. Somebody, somewhere made that thing. Nobody knows why, but whatever crazy world that is, whatever the hell that place is, that's what people call the Core World. If they had the technology to punch a hole through every parallel universe, think what kind of a crazy goddamn Earth that must be. I mean, they must be a thousand years ahead of us, technology-wise. And no one's ever been there before. But every once in a while, somebody stumbles across a piece of technology. It's like a scrap from the grown ups' table. Something that's so crazy, cool and sophisticated that it has to be from the Core World. How did your dad get it? I guess that's the Big Danny. The what? The-- You-- The thing-- You-- [] MAN: Hey, uh... it's cool if you wanna work back here and all, I guess. But the bank called. Can you reauthorize the charges? For some reason they think it might be identity theft. Identity theft? I know, right? I was like, "What? The dude's right here." [COMPUTER BEEPS] Happy? Cool, yeah. No more interruptions. [] "Alex Carver, predeceased by his wife Livia by three years, survived by their daughter, Beatrix." What? I went to college in this world. Goddamn it. Well, that's a good thing, right? Well, that's weird. What? It doesn't mention Ronan. This is not my room. I mean, it's my room-- No, I get it, I get it. You know what this is called? This is called the parallel universe dj vu. Did you think all your old stuff was gonna be here? Everything's familiar and kind of not familiar at the same time? Sound about right? Yeah, it sounds about right. Yeah. Do I seem familiar? What do you mean? You know, you feel like we've met before? Um-- Why? Well, other Ronans in other universes, we keep meeting up world after world, and we always end up right here in your bed. Just like this. Oh, you liar. [LAUGHS] Oh, man, I totally had you going. Oh, for like a second. You were totally psyched. Sounds like... Whatever. You don't even exist in this universe, pally. Ouch. [POLLY CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] What? Nothing. Come on, tell me. I guess I was hoping... I didn't have the best time growing up in this house. I got into a lot of fights. And I was always upsetting my mom. She'd always just be like, "You gotta learn to control yourself, sweetie. You gotta learn to control yourself." [SIGHS] I used to have a bad temper. Used to. What happened? I killed her. We were driving home this one time, and this truck sideswiped us and ran us off the road. It was real scary. We thought we were gonna go over. I don't know. I got out, and this guy is like stammering. He's clearly drunk or something. He's mumbling, he's mumbling, and next thing I know, I'm grabbing the guy, I'm dragging him out of the window. And I'm just wailing on him, wailing on him. My mom jumps out the car. She's yelling at me, because, you know, she doesn't want me to kill the guy. And I guess the way that our car was parked, traffic was swerving and they couldn't-- They couldn't see her and-- I heard this noise, and I turned around-- [SOBBING] I'm so-- I'm sorry. It was my fault. As you can imagine, I wasn't very popular around here after that. My dad was a ghost. Beatrix had to cancel her college plans to take care of him. And I just split. I was just hoping that maybe in this world, maybe things were a little bit better. [SNIFFLES] But, you know, there is no other you in this world. [CHUCKLES] Lucky him. [SIGHS] You're gonna have to get used to the dj vu. Some worlds are gonna be really, really different. And then some worlds are very weirdly the same. How much the same? [] Huh. Now, how's that for dj vu? [] [] We need to get out. Carver, get out here! We need to get out right now. Carver! [] [THUDS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GUN COCKS] [WHIRRING] What the hell was that? I don't know, I found it like 10 worlds ago. But that was the last charge, so... [] Who were those guys? I don't know exactly. Strangers. I've seen them in enough worlds to know not to mess with them. But if they're after your dad, then he's in worse trouble than I thought. All right, do you know how to drive one of these things? You don't know how to drive? Come on. [TIRES SCREECH] I don't believe this. Beatrix, I suppressed evidence. What evidence? Against the corporation. Okay? The corporation that killed, like, hundreds of people, by the way. It's in his e-mails. I mean, that sucks, but I guess I just don't know what we're supposed to do about it. Yeah, but I gotta do something, right? What if I were to just e-mail all of it right now to The New York Times? But then what? I mean, do you really wanna ruin other you's life? Yeah. [] What's that? [WHIRRING] [WHIRRING] Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened? Okay, we should get out of here. Come on. Let's go find Ronan and what's-her-name. Okay, one second. What? Well, I just-- I'll meet you downstairs in a minute. Okay? Okay, but hurry. [] Aah! Oh! Oh. [SIGHS THEN LAUGHS] Honey, you scared me. I thought you were still at work. God. Hey. BEATRIX 2: You know, the craziest thing happened to me on the way up to here. I was walking up the stairs, and I ran into this girl. I swear, she looked just like me. Harry? [] Oh. All right. Okay. All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, everything's fine. It was a misunderstanding, okay? I was hacked. I'm misrepresented, okay, by a hacker. Sir, get your microphone out of my face, sir. You're being very aggressive, so-- Get that [BLEEP] microphone out of my face! [] There's more than enough juice in this thing to kill us both a thousand times over. I suggest you let go. You tried to shoot me. If I wanted to shoot you, you'd be shot. [GRUNTS] I thought you got nuked. That was the idea. So I had to wait inside. Just in case. What are you doing? I'm ringing the doorbell. What? Somebody made the building, right? It didn't make itself. Somebody, yeah. Somewhere. Not somewhere. Here. And they're still here. No. Bullshit. What, you think this is a ghost ship? If you made this thing, would you leave it? Who's operating it? Who keeps it running? Who makes it jump? You ask me? Somebody's home. RONAN: We've been up there. You've been to the seventh floor? Well, there's a hell of a lot more floors. You don't believe me? Go outside and count. But there's no way up past the seventh floor. The eighth floor's all concreted over. Oh, there's a way. There's always a way. We just don't know where the door is. [RUMBLING] Whoa. Whoa. What are you doing? POLLY: Holy shit. He hacked it. TINKER: Little shock to the system. Just enough to get its attention. [WHIRRING] You know, I think we have enough time. I can figure out how to control the building from here. [GUN WHIRRING] B, take it easy. You touch that screen again, and I'll shoot you with it. B. This asshole tried to kill all of us. You take it so personally. Shut up! Beatrix. Just let him finish. What? Yeah, seriously. What? I want answers. Don't you guys wanna know what this place is? Why did Dad send us here? If we have any chance of finding Dad, the people upstairs have some explaining to do. I'm sorry. Are we seriously talking about letting this lunatic hotwire our only ride home? It's up to you, B. Well, fine. Can I have my gun back? [WHIRRING] [RUMBLING] Ohh. [WHIRRING] Come on. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [DISTANT THUD] [] [ELEVATOR BELL CONTINUES DINGING] [ELEVATOR ARRIVES] [] Dad? TINKER: You. I've been looking for you for a long time. It's not me you want. Oh, no. You're exactly who I want. The machine you made, no one's ever tapped into the building before. How did you manage to make a machine that could do that? [WHIRRING THEN RUMBLING] I wanna know why you murdered my family. I don't have any answers for you. [RUMBLING] Listen. You wanna know why your world was put to the torch? You have to go upstairs. That's the only way. [RUMBLING] You can tear this place down, or you can have your answers. But you can't have both. They're waiting for you. [] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS Hey, Mr. Carver. Hi, sweetheart. Dad. Ronan. It's good to see you. It's been a while. That's what you're gonna say right now? Dad, what the hell is going on? I spent my life trying to shield you both from this. Trying to shield us from what? From the building. Dad, you're not making any sense. What are you talking about? You know that we've been looking for you? You've been upstairs this whole time? No. I've been traveling. Since when? For a long time. Since before you were born. The Earth you grew up on, the one you think of as home, I wasn't born there. What? When we decided to stop traveling, we were looking for someplace familiar. Someplace safe. Wait, who's "we"? Your mom and me, we wanted to protect you. That was the most important thing. So Mom's not from here either? Do you still have the device I left you? Yeah, sure. Keep it. You're gonna need it. For what? You need to find your mother. Mom's dead. No. Dad, don't say that. Mom's dead. I saw her die. Not all of her. What? Listen to me. She's the only one that who knows how to get to the Core World. Find her. Bring that device to her. Why? Son, the building's been running for a long time now. Whatever its original purpose was, whoever built it, they're long gone. Then who's running it now? Nobody's running it. There's nobody up there. It's abandoned. That's why this machine could be the answer that saves us. I know you both can do this. This machine will help you find your mother. Look for the Core World. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Sweetheart, can I borrow that? [] Don't listen to him! He's lying! [GASPING] Oh! BEATRIX: Who are you? I'm your father, Beatrix. Dad. Dad, no. Where are you going? I wish I could go with you. But I have my own war to fight. I'll see you both again. BEATRIX: Dad. Dad. Dad! [ALARM BLARING] Well, that was a weird family reunion. [] Are we jumping already? Okay. What are we doing? Learning how to drive this. What if you--? Don't just touch things. We have to press something. POLLY: We don't know what we're looking at. Possibilities. I think that's what these lines represent. Yeah, that could actually be right. Are we doing this? For mom. For mom. RONAN: Here goes. [WHIRRING] HAROLD: Whoa! What is that? Is that the sun or--? Shall we have a look? [] POLLY 2: Damn. All right, 3, you're up. Hey. [] [] []
