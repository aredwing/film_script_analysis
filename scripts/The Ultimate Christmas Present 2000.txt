Weather, Here's Edwin Hadley. Goood Morning, Los Angeles. (Clears Throat) There's Only 3 More Days Until Christmas, So Be Sure To Ask Santa For Plenty Of Sunscreen, Because We'll Be Having Hot And Sunny Weather... F-For The Next Several Days. This Is Primarily Due To A 3% Drop In The Atmospheric Pressure From The Jet Stream Winds In The Northwestern Troposphere Combined With A Steady 24 3/4% Precipitation Factor, So... If Some Of You Young Meteorologists Have An Isobar Chart At Home-- Boring. (Beep Beep Beep) Oh, No, It...That's Ok. We Can Change The Menu Again, Mrs. Dombrowski. Mom! I Can't Find My Smash Crash Load Game. I Left It In The Computer. Ok, Honey, I'm Really Busy. No, The Airport Is Going To Be A Zoo, So Get There Early. Hey, Which Tie, The Red Or Blue? Uh, Red. It's More Christmassy. No, No, No, I Was Talking To My Wife. I Was Talking To My Husband, Sorry. (Telephone Rings) Allie, Will You Get That? Get The Phone. Get The Phone! Joey, Eat! Enough With The Syrup! Thompsons. Sam, Get Over Here Right Away. Walk! Walk! Blake Lynch Called Me, And We're Invited To His Christmas Party. Sam: I'll Be Right Over. Ok, Tell Me Everything. Ok. Blake's Party's At 4:00 On Christmas, And I Told Him We'd Be There A Couple Of Hours Early So We Can Help Decorate. That Way, We Can Spend A Couple Of Hours With Him Before Anyone Else Gets There. You're A Genius! Thanks. I Know. Samantha, Do You Realize That We're About To Leave Behind Our Lives As Geeky Semioutsiders And Evolve Into Cool, Popular Insiders? At Last! Samantha, What Do You Think Of When You Hear BONESFORBOWSER.COM? Um...A Website That Sells Dog Bones? Exactly! See, I Told You It Was Catchy. Dad, Do You Really Think People Will Want To Buy Dog Bones Over The Internet? Oh, They Will, When They Learn We Have Over 100 Varieties To Choose From. Our Investors In San Francisco Will Love It. How Long Are You Going To Be Gone This Time? Just A Day. I'll Be Back Tomorrow Morning. So, Tomorrow Night We Should Definitely Get Together And Discuss Our Schedules For Christmas Day. I Was, Uh, I Was Thinking We'd Open Presents From 8:00 To 10:00 And, Uh, Church At 11:00... And Have Lunch At, Uh... Oh, At 12:30. What Do You Think Of That? We'll Be Done By 2:00, Right? We've Gotta Be. That's When My Basketball Tournament Starts. And Sam And I Have A Party. Don't Forget Uncle Don And Aunt Gwen Are Coming Around 6:0 With The Grandparents. Ok, Well, Just Bring Your Schedules, And I'll Make A Chart. (Telephone Rings) Mom Loves Making Charts. (Telephone Rings) I Heard That. Creative Catering. Well, Hello, Mr. Fortuna. Sure, We Can Add 4 People, No Problem. See Ya, Mom. Bye, Sweetie. Uh, No, I Was Talking To My Daughter. Sorry. Bye, Dad. Have A Good Flight. And If You Get Some Time For Christmas Shopping, I Really, Really Want Pro-Line Deluxe Rollerblades. Well, Don't You Already Have Rollerblades? They're So Last-Year. The New Ones Have Carbon-Fiber Tips With Wheels That Are Road-Tested Up To 80 Miles Per Hour. Oh, Well, That's Reassuring. I've Got To Get The New Renegade Starship Video Game. Don't Forget. Hey! Aren't You Kids Forgetting What Christmas Is All About? No. It's About Presents. Kidding! Bye! Walk! (Telephone Rings) Remember That A Paragraph Concentrates On One Idea. If You're Moving On To Another Idea, Conclude The Paragraph And Start A New One. Allie! Allie! Oh, Um, Yes, Mrs. Lopez. Allie, How's Your Creative-Writing Paper Coming Along? Which One? The One I Assigned Last Week. 5 Pages, Single-Spaced, Due Tomorrow. Oh...Yeah, That One. It's, Uh, Genius. Best Thing I've Ever Written. Congratulations. What's It About? Oh, Uh... It's About, Uh... It's About... It's About William Shakespeare. Who...Wakes Up One Morning And Finds Himself Living Here, Today. But The Problem Is No One Believes Who He Really Is, And He Has To Make Money, So He Gets A Job Flipping Burgers At A Fast-Food Place. And During His Breaks, He Writes Plays, And Pretty Soon, He Comes Up With A New One Called A Tale Of 2 Pickles Which-- (Bell Rings) You Want Me To Finish? Let's Keep It A Surprise. I Look Forward To Reading It. I Have To Admit, That Was A Pretty Good Story, For Just Making It Up On The Spot. Yeah, But Now I've Got To Write It, And I Forgot Almost Everything I Said. It's Not Fair. Tomorrow's The Very Last Day Before Christmas Vacation. I Hate To Bring This Up, But We Did Have A Week To Do It. That's Not The Point, Sam. Ok. So, What Is The Point? The Point Is I Have Got To Come Up With A Plan, Some Way To Get Out Of Doing This Paper At All Costs. Hey, Allie, Sam. Hi, Blake! Hi, Blake! Can You Guys Still Come To My Christmas Party? Uh, Yeah. Yeah. And Like I Said, We'll Come Over Early So We Can Help Decorate. Cool. By The Way, Allie, Your Story In Class Was Awesome. Oh, Thanks. Well, Bye. Bye! (Screaming) Uh-Oh, What Time Is It? 4:00. Ahh. We've Got 72 Hours Until Blake's Party, And We Have To Get To The Library, And We Still Haven't Even Gotten Joey's Christmas Present Yet. Forget It, Al. We'll Never Make It. Sure We Will. Joey And His Friends Take A Shortcut Through The Woods All The Time. It'll Be Perfect. Allie, Are You Sure About This? Positive. We'll Be Home Before You Know It. Didn't We Pass That Same Tree, Like, An Hour Ago? We'll Be There In 5 Minutes. Trust Me. Every Time You Say, "Trust Me," I Either End Up In Detention Or On A Missing-Persons List. Whoa. Check It Out. What? That. What A Weird Little House. I Know. Have You Ever Seen It Before? No. But I've Never Been Lost In These Woods Before, Either. What Are You Doing? I'm Gonna Find Out Who Lives There. Come On. Allie, Whoever It Is, There's A Reason They Built Their House Way Out Here. Like Privacy. There's Some Old Guy Inside. He's Building Something. That's Nice. Let's Go. What'll You Give Me If I Ding-Dong-Ditch? Nothing. Oh, Come On. If I Ring The Doorbell, Then You Do My English Paper, But If I Get Scared And Chicken Out, I Do Yours. Mine's Almost Finished. Besides He Could Catch Us. No, He Won't. Anyway, We Can Outrun An Old Man. Grrr... Durn It All! I Am So Out Of Here. Cranberries. It's Just A Machine. It's Just Wires And Gears. Wait A Second. W-W-Wait.... Oh. What Do You Think It Is? I Don't Know. Put It Back. Why? He Threw It Out. But It's Still Not Yours. It's Garbage. It's Anybody's. Come On! Contraption... Never Works Right... More Trouble Than It's Worth. Oh, No! (Telephone Rings) (Ring) Creative Catering. Ruben Speaking. Excuse Me, Did You Just Say Christmas Eve? Ok, No Offense, But You're Crazy. Christmas Eve Has Been Booked Solid For, Like, 8 Months Now. Hello! Hello? He Hung Up On Me. Well, That's Because You Insulted Him. I Did Not Insult Him. I Told Him The Truth. He's Crazy. Christmas Eve Bookings. Plan Ahead, People. Mom, When Are We Going To Get Our Christmas Tree? We're Going To Get The Tree As Soon As Dad Comes Back From San Francisco. But All The Good Ones Will Be Gone By Then. Well, Then We're Just Gonna Have To Stand Uncle Don And Aunt Gwen Up In A Corner And Decorate Them, I Guess. Are They Really Coming? Joey... But Uncle Don Always Smokes Those Smelly Cigars, And Aunt Gwen Never Gets My Name Right. She Always Calls Me Josie. That's The Name Of Her Own Poodle. Hey, Everybody! Sure Smells Good In Here. Yeah, We Never Get To Eat The Good Stuff. We Get Frozen Dinners. Hah, You Do Not. You Get Takeout. How Was School? Uh...Fine. We're Going To Go Upstairs And Do Some Homework. Walk! You Know That Tv Show Where People Take Their Junk To Some Expert, And He Tells Them It's Worth A Million Dollars? Well, Maybe This Is Worth Something. Or Maybe It's Just Junk. Nah, It's Too New To Be Junk. It's Kind Of Cool-Looking. I Wonder What It Does. Oh, What Did You Do? I Just Touched That Button. Well, Try Another One. Maybe It'll Turn It Off. (Whistle Blows) Wow! Awesome! Oh, This Is So Cool. Hey, I Think You Figured Out How It Works. Yeah. Now Help Me Stop It. (Thunder Rumbles) Aah! You'll Flood The Place! I'm Trying Not To! Let's Try This. (Thunder Rumbles) That Is So Cool! Wow! Let Me Try! No, No, No, No, No. (Thunder) Aah! Aah! Oh! Whoa, How Fierce Is That! What's Fierce?! Hey, Joey, Stay Out! Why? 'Cause I Said So. You're Not The Boss Of Me! Mom! Allie's Bossing Me! No, I'm Not! Joey: Are You Wrapping My Christmas Present? What Did You Get Me? Don't Tell Me! Let Me Guess. You Got Me A Football. No, No, No. I Know. You Got Me A Poster Of The Laker Girls! Joey! Stay Out, Or I'm Not Getting You Anything! I Mean It! You'd Better Hide It Good, Or Else I'll Find It. I Always Do. My Turn! Check Out These Symbols. This Must Be Some Sort Of Weather-Making Machine. I Wonder What This Swirly Line Means. Whoa! Whoa, Whoa! Turn It! Turn It! Turn It! Here, Let's Try This One. Aah! Earthquake! Aah! Earthquake! Do You Feel That? Oh, Don't Panic! Get Under A Table Or An Open Doorway! Get A Transistor Radio! Get Some Bottled Water! Get Some Canned Goods! Just Try And Stay Calm, Ok? It's Ok. It's Ok. It's Over. It Was Just A Truck Passing By. Yeah, Right. That's What They Said Just Before The Big One In '94, Remember? Ooh, Sorry! It's Ok. At Least We Know What That Jiggly Line Means. We'll Just Leave That One Alone From Now On. Let's Try The Snow One. Wow! Oh, This Is So Rad! Why Would That Man Throw It Out? Maybe He Didn't Mean To Throw It Out. Yes, He Did. We Saw Him. Well, We Should Bring It Back. I Mean, This Thing Could Flood A City Or Cause A Blizzard Or... Do I Even Want To Know What's Going Through Your Mind? Sam, How Would You Like To Start Christmas Vacation A Day Early? How? With A Snow Day. A What? A Snow Day. You Know, My Cousin Stan Lives In Boston, And He Said Every Once In A While, They Get So Much Snow That They Have To Close Down The Schools 'Cause They Can't Clear The Roads Fast Enough. We Do It With This. We'll Just Put It Outside, Crank Up The Volume, And Make It Snow Real Hard. Are You Nuts? Do You Know How Much Trouble We Could Get In? Sam...How Happy Would Everybody Be If We Actually Had A White Christmas In L.A. For Like The First Time Ever? We'd Be Doing This Incredible Service For Our Community. Well... And Guess What Else? If Tomorrow Is A Snow Day, Then We Have 2 Extra Weeks To Do That Dumb Creative-Writing Assignment. And Even More Important, We Have A Whole Extra Day To Plan What We're Going To Wear For Blake's Party. Am I Brilliant Or What? In A Mad Scientist Sort Of Way. Mrs Thompson: Allie! Oh, Hurry, Hurry, Hurry! I Need Your Help, Honey. Yeah, Mom. What Have You Guys Been Doing In Here? Uh... The Floor's Soaked! Oh, Sorry, Mom. We'll Clean It Up. Allie I Have 5 Parties In 2 Days. I Need Some Help. Ok. Now! Get Some Towels, Mop Up The Water So It Doesn't Ruin The Floor. And How Many Times Have I Told You To Put Your Dirty Clothes In The Hamper? I'll Do It. I'll Do It, Mom. Don't. Don't. I Got It. Ugh! W-W-What Are You Doing? Shh! It Isn't Working. Mmm, Maybe It Just Takes Some Time. Well, It Was A Great Idea Anyway. Better Get Started On That Paper. P.A.: All Dollies To Loading Dock B. All Dollies To Loading Dock B, Please. Shirley, Has Santa Called In From The Summer Cabin Yet? Shirley: No, Mrs. Claus. All Right. Well, Then, Send In The Elves. Shirley: Right Away. Hey, Mrs. Claus! Get Ready To Be Impressed! Say Good-Bye To The Old North Pole And Hello To The New. Santa's 21ST-Century Toy Factory And Warehouse. Every Square Inch Of The 10-Mile Radius Completely Automated. Absolutely Nothing Is Touched By Elfin Hands. And Since Elves Are Going To Be Obsolete, We're Going To Retrain Them To Be... Telemarketers! Taking Phone, Catalogue, And Internet Orders 24 Hours A Day, 365 Days A Year. I Know What You're Thinking, Mrs. C. "Crumpet, What About Tradition? "Won't The Public Be Disappointed With The Fact That Santa Has Entered The Digital Age?" "No," We Say. Phooey! Because Half The Stuff They Print About Us Anyway, Is Totally Wrong. Heck, People Still Think We're 3 Feet Tall And Have Squeaky Little Voices. Ha Ha Ha. So, What Do You Think, Mrs. C? Hey, Don't Beat Around The Bush, Mrs. C. All Right. I Think It's The Worst Idea I've Ever Heard. Both: Ohh. Well, Is That A "No" Or A "Maybe"? (Telephone Rings) Excuse Me. Hello? (Ring) Hello? (Ring) Hello! Mama, The Weather Machine Is Missing! Oh! The Weather Machine Is Missing? Huh? Santa: It's Gone. Santa: It's Vanished. It's Disappeared! Oh, I Never Should've Tossed It Out. Mrs. Claus: You Tossed It Out? It Wasn't Working Properly, And So I Was Frustrated, And I... I Threw It In The Trash. And When I Went To Get It Back, It Wasn't There Anymore. All Right, Darling. It Must've Been Just Misplaced. Did You Search The Cabin? Yes. Mrs. Claus: Retraced Your Steps? Yes! Tell Him To Check His Pockets. Did You Check Your Pockets, Dear? It Can't Fit In My Pockets! Oh. Santa: What If It Gets Into The Wrong Hands? There's No Telling What Could Happen. The Consequences Could Be Disastrous! Mrs. Claus: All Right, Darling. Calm Down. There's No Time To Calm Down. I Have To Find That Machine! You Will. I'll Send Help. Fiona And Twinkle Will Be There Before You Can Name The Reindeer. Santa: Christmas Is 3 Days Away. You Can't Spare My Best Elves Now. Mrs. Claus: Don't Worry. We'll Manage. Give Me A Kiss. Mama. Papa. Ho Ho Ho! Mmm. Bye, Dear. Santa: Bye. Uh, We'll Go. Yeah, We'll Go! We Can Help Santa Better Than Anyone. Yeah, 'Cause, Uh, When You Need To Find A Lost Weather Machine, We're The Only Elves For The Job. Please! Please, Mrs. C. All Right, Then. Come On. Oh Ho Ho! It's A Light Load, So You Shouldn't Need More Than 2 Reindeer. Let Me See. Why Don't You Take Prancer And Vixen. They Don't Get Out Much. Ok. Except... Except... Except There's One Small Problem. What? Tell Her. Well, See, I'm Kind Of Afraid Of Reindeer. I Got Bit Once By Dasher. Well, You Shouldn't Have Poked Him. I Didn't Poke Him. I Petted Him. No, You Poked Him Like This. Hey! Hey, Back! I'm Getting Always-- Boys. I'll Fight You. I'll Fight You-- Boys! I'm Sorry. But I'm Going To Have To Send For Fiona And Twinkle. No! No! This Is The Perfect Opportunity To Show Off Our Newest Invention. Let's Show Her. Let's Show Her. Ok, Mrs. C., You're About To Witness The Greatest Invention In History. Introducing... North Pole S.U.V. S.U.V.? Both: Santa Utility Vehicle! The World's Very First Rocket-Powered Toy-Delivery System! (Telephone Rings) Hey, Joey. Have You Studied Much Shakespeare? What's Shakespeare? Forget It. Allie! What? Your Father Would Like To Talk To You. You're Gonna Get It Mr. Thompson: Hello? Hi, Dad. What Is This I Hear About You And Samantha Practically Destroying Your Room? Um, Well, Things Kind Of Got A Little Out Of Hand. It's...Kind Of A Long Story. But We Cleaned Everything Up. Allie, You're 13 Years Old. That's Too Old To Be Acting Up Like That. Yeah, I Know. Sorry, Dad. And Don't Forget What Time Of Year It Is. Santa Might Find Out. And, Uh... We Don't Want That To Happen, Do We? No. What? Oh, My Gosh, Kids! It's Snowing! Mom Says It's-- No Way! What?! Oh, My Gosh, Come Here! No Waaay! Oh, It's Snow! Look At That! Yes! Hello? Mrs. Thompson: Give Me The Phone! Steve! You Are Not Going To Believe This! It Is Snowing Here! It's What? All: Yaaay! Try And Catch One With Your Tongue! So Cool! This Is So Great! Hey, Did You Ever Think You'd See A White Christmas In L.A.? No! Maybe A Brown One Due To A Mud Slide, But Definitely Not This. Hang On. I'm Getting My Camera! Ok. Pretty Wild, Huh? Yeah! Who'd Have Thought? Deck The Halls With Boughs Of Holly All: Fa La La La La La La La 'Tis The Season To Be Jolly Fa La La La La La La La La Don We Now Our Gay Apparel Fa La La La La La La-- Ohhh! Are We Almost There? Yeah, In About 3 Hours. Ugh. Can We Make A Pit Stop? Why? You Know Why. Hmm. Didn't I Tell You To Go To The Bathroom Before We Left? Well, I Did, But I Got To Go Again! Well, We're Not Stopping. Cross Your Legs Or Something. Whew! Ugh! Are We Supposed To Be Heading East? What? The Compass. It's Pointing East. You Nitwit! That's Not A Compass. That's A Fuel Gauge. Oh! (Engine Dies) Sparky, Didn't I Tell You To Put Gas In The Gas Tank? Yeah! Did You? Oh. I Think I Forgot. Well, We're Taking A Pit Stop Now. Ok, Everybody, Here We Go! In 5, 4, 3, 2... You're On! Good Evening. This Is Edwin Hadley, Here With Your Channel 3 Evening Action Weather. The Weather Continues As Predicted. Sunny Days, Continuing...Into Only Slightly Cooler Evenings. We Interrupt This Program For A Special Weather Bulletin. Ah... Ah... I'm--I'm Sorry. There Seems To Be Some Kind Of Mistake. You See, I've Just Been Handed A Report That Says There's... Well, There's Snow Outside. As We All Know, That's Impossible, So I'll Simply Disregard This. And Now, Back To Our Real Report. As I Said, Sunny Days Ahead. For The Next 5 Days, We-- What Is It Now? I Told You That This Is Impossible! Can You Not See That I'm Up Here? (Crumples Paper) Ladies And Gentlemen, I Can Assure You That There Is Not Now, Nor Has There Ever Been, At This Elevation And Temperature, Even The Most Remote Possibility Of-- Ohh. Snow. Ahem. It Does Seem That The Los Angeles Area Is Experiencing An Unexpected Cold Front... Combined With Increased Levels Of Precipitation, Which In Turn, Has Resulted... In Snow. Oh, My. Come On. Come On, Keep Going. Keep Going. Snow, Indeed. The Storm Started Somewhere. Before This Night Is Through, I'm Gonna Figure Out Where. Edwin! Don't Bother Me Now. I'm In The Middle Of An Important, Groundbreaking Research Project. Ok. Sure. No Problem. But Mr. Martino Wants To See You. Right Away. Though I Suppose It's Never Too Late To Take A Break. What Do You Want For Christmas, Edwin? Well, Sir, I Hadn't Really Given It Much Thought. But, Uh, As Long As You Brought It Up, I Was Hoping To Be Able To Talk To You About The Possibility Of A Pay Raise-- A Small One, Of Course. Hmm. You Know What I Want? I Want To Wake Up One Morning, Turn On The Tv, And See You With A Nice, Bright Smile On Your Face Instead Of That Lemon-Sucking Grin You Got On Right Now. Well, Uh, Sir, I Wasn't Aware-- I Want To See You Wearing Something Else Instead Of That Idiotic Scrap Of Cloth You Call A Bow Tie. This Is From The Signature Collection-- And You Want To Know What I Want Most Of All? I Want You To Once, Just Once In My Lifetime, To Keep Me Awake When I Watch You. What Are You Insinuating? Oh! Do I Have To Spell It Out For You? Ok. You Are Dull, Boring, Tedious, Tiresome, A Yawnfest, A Snooze-A-Thon. I'd Rather Watch Paint Dry Then To Watch You. And Then To Top It All Off... Hello! There's A Snowstorm Outside! In Los Angeles! And You Didn't Even See It Coming! Well, No One Did, Sir. It Was Quite Unexpected. Oh. Did The Weather Fairy Just Wave Her Magic Wand, And Poof! It Snowed? Yes, Sir. Well, It's... I Mean... I Mean, No, Sir. But The Pattern Of This Storm Is Unlike Any Other In History. Instead Of Moving Across Its Target, It Seems To Have Just Appeared And Spread Out In All Directions. So, In Measuring The Amount Of Snowfall, I'm Going To Be Able To Determine From Where It's Been The Longest, Thus Where It Began. Ok, Wait, Wait. Imagine I'm The Audience. And, Hey, Guess What? I'm Asleep! Well, Mr. Martino, As To-- Oh, Come On, Hadley! Let's Face It. You Are A Joke, An Embarrassment, The Worst Weatherman In The World! You Know, The Only Reason I Kept You Around This Long Is Because I'm Married To Your Sister. But Even She Says I Should Let You Go. Belinda Said That? Uh-Huh. But Since It's The Holidays And I'm Feeling Very Charitable, I'm Going To Give You One More Chance. Now You Are Gonna Go Out There, And Dig Up Some Real News About This Storm. Like Are The Backstreet Boys Going To Cancel Their Concert In The Park? Or How's Brad Pitt Getting To The Set Of His New Movie? That's What I Want To Know! Yes, Sir! Good. Oh, Oh, Oh! And Be Sure To Get A Lot Of Hard-Luck Stories About Cars Not Starting And People Slipping On Ice-- You Know, Christmas Being Ruined. It'll Help Boost Our Ratings. Yes, Sir! Good. Oh, And, Hadley. About That Pay Raise? Yes, Sir. Forget It! Yes, Sir. Please Understand That This Snowfall Was Completely Unexpected, A Meteorological Fluke, If You Will. It--It--It Did Not Show Up On, Uh, On Our Radar. Ok, Ok! What About The Schools? Rest Assured That As Of This Moment, I'm Doing Everything In My Power To Trace Its Origin. Now, If I Were To Hasten A Hypothetical Guess, I Would Be Looking For A Mass Of Polar Air From The North, Quite Possibly, Alaska. Now Imagine As The Air Wends Its Way Down From Alaska And Through Canada, The Smell Of Sockeye Salmon Wending Through Bakersfield And Coming Down Through Arizona Into The San Fernando Valley, Where It Would Meet Up With A Subtropical Air Front, Carrying With It The Smells Of Mexico And The Sounds Of The Mariachi Band. We Would Get A Sort Of Mixture And An Interplay Between These 2 Different Isobar, Isothermic Fronts, Creating A Sort Of Meteorological Lambada. If You Will-- Ok. That's Right, Folks. All This Glorious Snow Isn't A Special Effect Dreamed Up By Tinseltown, But The Real Thing. And Good News For All You Kids. Put Down Your Books And Grab Your Snowboards, Because The Following Schools Are Closed. Adams High School, Cutler Elementary... Yeahhh! Evergreen High School, Fairfax Elementary, Fairview Junior High, Century Middle School, Grant Junior High. Grant Junior High. Come On. Carine Elementary, Harrison Elementary, Oh, What About Grant? Did She Say Grant? No! Jackson Elementary, Jackson High School, Harrisburg High School, Inglewood Middle School. I'm Sorry. I Skipped One. Grant Junior High-- Both: Yaaay! (Rock Version Of Jingle Bells) Yaaaay! It's Snow! I'll Be Right Back. Whooo! You're So Mean! I'm Gonna Get You! Ahhh! Ha Ha Ha! Wow! Yeaaaah! Ha Ha Ha! Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells Jingle All The Way Hey, Mr. C! Sorry We're Late. I Bet You're Glad To See Us. Where's Twinkle And Fiona? Oh, They Were Gonna Come, But A Crisis Like This Required The Best. So We Volunteered! Lucky Me. What In The World Is That? Oh, This Old Thing? Nothing But The Greatest Revolution In Christmas Industry. That Is, Since Your Patented Chimney Expander. Christmas Is Not An Industry, Crumpet. It's A Holiday. We've Been Meaning To Talk To You About That. Ok, Mr. C, Connect With Me. Ok, Stay Right There. Think About This. 4-Wheel-Drive All The Time, On The Fly, And Unlimited Cargo Space And, Wait, You Ready For This? This Is The Kicker. No More Nasty Reindeer To Contend With. I--I Can't Think About This Right Now. We've Got To Find That Machine Before The Snow Gets Any Worse. You Got It, Chief. Although, Uh, You Know, Sparky And I Have A Few New Gift Ideas We Want To Run By You. Like, We Got-- Crumpet! Ok, Ok, Ok! Uh, Where Would I Be If I Was A Weather Machine? Did You Check The Cabin? Yes. Did You Retrace Your Steps? Yes! Did You Check Your Pockets? I've Been Through This Before! I've Checked Every Square Inch Of-- What's This? I Know This One! Uh, It's A Trash Can Lid. Underneath! Both: A Shoeprint. Santa: This Is Terrible. It's My Worst Fear Come True. The Weather Machine Has Been Stolen. The 14 Inches... Of Snow... That Has Fallen Since Last Night Easily Eclipses The Previous Record For Los Angeles County Of 0.3 Inches On January 19, 1949. Nothing Suspicious About That Snowfall, On That Day. Yes. Mrs.Dombrowski, I Promise Even With The Snow, We Will Have Everything For Your Party. In Fact, It's Almost Ready As We Speak. Yes. Ok, You Know What? I Have To Go, Though. My Other Line Is Ringing. Ok, I'll See You Soon. Bye-Bye. Creative Catering. Mr. Thompson: Hello, Darling. How's It Going? Oh, Hi, Honey. I Am So Crazed. Are You On Your Way Home? Not Quite. You Know That Snowstorm Of Yours... Well, It Started Here About An Hour Ago. That's Why I Called. My Flight's Delayed. How Long? Oh, They Don't Know Yet, But At Least A Couple Of Hours. Oh, Honey, I Am So Sorry. Yeah. Me, Too. Oh, Well. Give Me A Chance To Eat Some Delicious Airport Food. How Are The Kids? Well, They're Great 'Cause The Schools Are Closed. Oh. Lucky Them. Lucky You. Well, You Know What? Actually, It's Been Fun. I Mean, You Should See Allie. She Is Out Of Her Mind. It's Almost Like She Personally Ordered Up This From The Weather Service Herself. Well, What Do You Think? (Squawking) Definitely Needs More Sugar. You're Right! Bawk! Too Much! Shh, Quiet. She's On The Phone. Don't Forget To Tell Steve About The Rollerblades. Oh, Honey, Before I Forget. I Am Having The Hardest Time Finding Those Rollerblades For Allie. Nobody Has Her Size. What Size Is She? Crumpet: Length, 7 Inches. Sparky: Check. Width, 3 1/2 Inches. Check. Elliptical Shoe Tread. Check. You Know, This Program We Put Together, For Lack Of A Better Word, Santa, Fantastic! In Just A Couple Of Seconds, It's Gonna Tell Us We're Looking For-- An Eagle's Flight Running Shoe, Size 7. Ok. How Did You Know That? I Delivered 40,000 Of Them Last Year, And There Are 1,937 Girls In Los Angeles With Size-7 Feet. Hmm. That's A Lot. Yeah. That's A Lot. Yeah. I Suggest We Dispense With The Nice Girls. We'll Take The Naughty-Girl List, And We'll Work Our Way Through Them. See, That's Why We're Connected, Santa, Because Sparky And I Put Together This Awesome Naughty And Nice Software Program. Give It To Me. Thanks. Uh, Uh, It's-- It's Ok. Shh... Was This In Your Candy Pocket? Well, It's, Uh,-- You Know, That's Nasty. Boys! I've Got The List. Let's Go. There's No Time To Lose.

That Was Your Dad, And He Is Stuck In San Francisco. What? Mrs. Thompson: All The Flights Are Cancelled. Joey: Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. What If He Can't Get Out? He Won't Be Here For Christmas. He Will. Trust Me. How Do You Know? I Just Know. I, Uh, Think I Left My Hat Up In Your Room. Oh, Yeah. We'll Be Right Back. Allie: It's Off. Then Why Is It Still Snowing? Because It Takes A While, Remember? That Machine's Powerful. Ya Think?! Hey, I Didn't Know The Signal Would Reach All The Way To San Francisco. Well Guess What. It Does. That's Why I Turned It Off, Ok? Think I Don't Want My Father Home For Christmas? I Mean, How Awful Would That Be? Can You Imagine How Much We'd All Miss Him? Yeah, I Think I Can. Oh, Sam, I'm Sorry. It's Ok. Do You Want To Talk About It? It's Ok If You Don't, But-- Look, My Dad Died When I Was Only 3, And I Barely Remember Him. So, How Can You Miss Someone You Don't Even Remember? Right? But Still, I Shouldn't-- It's Just Weird Around Christmas. Mom Says This Was His Favorite Time Of The Year. He'd Start Playing Christmas Music The Day After Thanksgiving. She Says He Would Have Kept Our Christmas Decorations Up All Year If She Would Have Let Him. Parents Are So Corny. My Mom Has This Charm Bracelet, That My Dad Gave Her Their Very First Christmas Together. And Every Year, He Gives Her A New Charm For It. And She Always Knows She's Gonna Get It, But She Still Acts All Surprised And Gets All Weepy And Emotional. (Sighs) I Have Got To Fix This, Sam. I Have To Do Something. If My Family Misses Christmas Because Of Me-- Sam's Mother: Samantha, Have You Found Your Hat? Yeah, Mom. Coming. Look. It Stopped. Thank Goodness. Hadley: Here In The Los Angeles Area, A Mysterious Snowstorm Finally Stopped At Approximately 6 P.M. This Evening. But That's Small Consolation To Jennifer Love Hewitt, Who Slipped On A Patch Of Ice In Burbank. Aw... Oh, Too Bad. Ahem. Well, You Ever Slip On A Patch Of Ice? Ok. That's Everybody's Schedule For Christmas Eve. Now, If I Can Just Shuffle Them Around A Little Bit, And We Can Spend A Few More Hours Together. Allie: Mom. Can You Come Here? Joey: Ta-Da! It's Our Substitute Christmas Tree. Just In Case Dad Gets Home Late Tomorrow Night And We Don't Have Time To Get A Real One. Do You Like It? I Love It. You Guys. Oh, And I Got Something That's Gonna Make It Even Better. So, That's What This Thing's For. That's Why They Call It A Fireplace, Joey. We Should Do This More Often. Are You Sure You've Got Time For This? You Make It Sound Like I'm Always Working. You Are. You Are. Especially This Time Of The Year. Well, It's My Busy Season. You Know That. But It'll Quiet Down After New Year's. Joey: Mom, I Miss Dad. Oh, I Do, Too, But You Know What? He's Gonna Be Home Really Soon. 'Cause The Storm's Over. It's Over. (Whirring And Buzzing) (Yawns) Ok, Bye. Samantha? Be Good Today. And Be Sure To Help Out Mrs. Thompson I Will. Ok. What's Going On? I Don't Know. It Turned Itself Back On. So, Turn It Off. I Tried. It Won't Do It. Why Wouldn't It? I Don't Know. None Of The Buttons Work Anymore. Mrs. Thompson: But, Linda, Listen. Is There Any Way You Can Stay Home Today? No, We're Already Understaffed, And With The Storm, The Whole Hospital's On Emergency Alert. The Road's Are Just Gonna Be Awful. I Know. I'll Be Ok. Thanks A Lot, Michelle. You Be Careful. Ok. Good-Bye. Ok. Bye. Tv Announcer: Right, Bob, The Surprise Blizzard Continues To Wreak Havoc Throughout The West Coast. The National Guard Has Been Called Out To Ensure That No Motorists Attempt To Use The Closed Freeways. A Record Number Of Airports, Bus Lines, And Rail Services Have Been Completely-- Hadley! Hadley! This Story Just Came In. The Cast Of Friends Are Trapped Inside Their Studio. I Want You On It Right Away! Yes, Sir. I'll Get Right On That Riveting Bit Of News. You Better, Or You'll Get Right On The Unemployment Line. Here It Comes. Storm Originated At... 318 Central Avenue. Yes. Allie: Hey, Mom. We Shoveled The Driveway. It Just Keeps Coming Down. What's Wrong? Well, I've Had A Lot Of Calls, And Your Uncle Don And Aunt Gwen Are Snowed In And Won't Be Here Tomorrow. And Neither Will Your Grandparents. Well, What About Dad? Have You Heard From Him? Dad Is Stuck In San Francisco, And Everything Is Shut Down. Can't He Rent A Car? Oh, Sweetie, The Roads Are Closed. So, He Won't Be Coming Home For Christmas, Will He? No, Honey. No Fair! I Hate The Snow. I Wish It Never Happened. I Know. Me, Too. (Sniffling) Man: If You Can't Move It, Push It Off To The Side. Woman: I'm Doing The Best I Can Here. (Horn Honking) Man: Reverse, Then Forward! Hadley: Oh, For The Love Of-- Hasn't Anyone In This Town Ever Seen A Blizzard Before? What Is The Matter With You People? Man: Come On. Get Back In Your Car. Stop! Stop! Stop! Whoa! Something Wrong? I'm Edwin Hadley. Who? I'm Edwin Hadley! Channel 3 Action Now News. Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. You're That Real Boring News Guy. Yes, Exactly. I Need To Commandeer Your Vehicle. It's For Official Meteorological Business. Now Give Me The Helmet. I'll Be Sure To Mention You In My Emmy Speech. Hey, Hey! Man! You Are Done Like Dinner, Literally. No. No, Mrs. Dombrowski, Don't Cancel. No, You Know What? Your Party Is Gonna Go Off Without A Hitch. Despite The Storm. I Give You My Word As A Caterer. I Give You My Word As A Mother. Absolutely. Uh-Huh, No Problem. Allie: Yeah. I Understand. Mm-Hmm. Ok. Thanks. Bye. That Was Blake. He Cancelled The Party Because Of The Storm. This Is So Out Of Control, Allie. This Thing Is Single-Handedly Destroying Our Lives. Thanks, 'Cause I Didn't Feel Bad Enough Already. (Huffs) Sam, Where You Going? Sam! Sam, I Tried Everything. Well, We'll Just Have To Try Again. I'm Telling You, It Won't Work. (Gasps) (Gasps) Hey, Joey? What Are You Doing? I Saw It. Saw What? My Present. Don't Pretend It's Not Out There. Joey, That's Not Your Present. Yeah, It Is. I Told You I'd Find It. I Can't Believe You Hid It In The Flower Box Again. Uh, Duh. That's Where You Hid My Birthday Present. Joey, I'm Telling You That's Not Your Present. Then What Is It? None Of Your Business. I Saw An Antenna. Is It A Boom Box? No. Joey, Look, It Maybe Yours, Or It May Not Be, But You've Got To Leave It Alone. I Don't Want You Near That Window Again, Do You Hear Me? Mom! Uh, Mrs. Dombrowski, Can You Hold On Just A Second? Thank You. What?! Joey's Bothering Us! No, I'm Not! Joey, Come Down Here Right This Instant. But, Mom! I Said, Come Here! Mrs. Dombrowski: Come There?! I Can't Even-- Not You. Mrs. Dombrowski, I'm--You--You Can Stay Where You Are. I Knew I'd Find It. Heh Heh Heh. Look, Why Don't We Just Go And Give That Man Back His Machine? No. Why Not? Because Mom Doesn't Want Us Going Outside. Besides, I'm Kind Of Scared To Go Back There, Not That We Did Anything Wrong Or Anything. You Mean, Besides Burying The City Of Los Angeles Under 10 Feet Of Snow? Anyways, I Don't Think We Can Find That Place Again, Even If We Tried. Well, We've Got To Do Somethin. Let's Smash It With The Hammer. No Way! That Can Make Things Worse. How Do You Know? I Don't, But What If It Does? Ok, Then What Do We Do? 'Cause We Can't Just Sit Here-- I've Got An Idea. The Machine's Antennas Are Pretty Small, And They're Sending Snow To San Francisco, Right? Yeah. Well, If We Make The Antennas Longer With Coat Hangers Or Something, Then We Can Send The Signal All The Way To Outer Space. And Cause A Blizzard All Over The World? Great Idea. We'll Be Responsible For The Next Ice Age. Stop Being Such A Pessimist. I'm Not. I'm Being Realistic. If You Hadn't Stolen The Machine, None Of This Would've Happened. I Didn't Steal It. I Took It Out Of The Garbage. If You Were So Worried About I, Then Why Didn't You Stop Me? I Tried To. No, You Didn't. You Were Too Chicken, Like Always. Chicken? Yeah, Chicken. (Loud Pop) Great, The Electricity. What Are You Gonna Do Now, Einstein? I'd Help You Out, But I'm Too Chicken. Uh, Yeah, That Was The Electricity. (Woman Complaining And Sobbing On The Other Line) Are--Mrs. Dombrowski? Are You Crying? Look, I'm Really Sorry, Ok? I Didn't Mean It. It's Just...I'm Getting Really Scared Right Now, And I Don't Know What To Do Anymore. D-Do You Have A Lead Box? What? I Don't Know. It Worked For Superman. If You Put That Thing In A Lead Box, Maybe It'll Stop The Rays From Getting Out. Well, My Dad's Got A Big Toolbox In The Garage. We Can Put The Machine In It And Then Bury It In The Backyard. Let's Go Get It. Ok, But We've Gotta Be Quiet. Mom Doesn't Want Us Going Outside. Yeah. No. I Understand, Mrs. Dombrowski. No--Yeah. Ok. Bye Bye. Ugh! Let Me Guess... She Canceled. Yeah. Good! I'm Glad. They Don't Call Her "Cheapo Dombrowski" For Nothing, You Know. We Would Have Been There Till 3:00 In The Morning And Not Even Have Gotten A Tip. Well, I Better Get Home. I Don't Want To Miss The Excitement When The Pipes Burst! Ruben, You Really Ought To Think About Staying Around Until At Least The Storm Calms Down. What? At This Rate, That Will Be, Like, The Fourth Of July. Well... Shh! Mom! The Girls Are Sneaking Out! What Are You Doing? We're Just Going Outside. No! I Told You To Stay Inside, And I Meant It! Um, But We're Just Going To The Garage. It's Going To Get Dark Soon, And Dad's Got A Big Flashlight Out There, The One For Emergencies. Ok, Go. Can I Go Outside, Too? No! Why Not? Joey! Please! Come On! There's Some Boxes Over There, And I Think There's Some Shovels On The Workbench. Uh, Samantha, Can You Open That? Open It? I Can't Even See It. Ouch! Man: Ouch! Second Man: Ow! Third Man: Ow! Samantha? Is That You? Just The First One. (Gasps) Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Not So Fast! You've Got Some Explaining To Do, Allie. You, Too, Samantha. Who... Allie... You Are Number 263 On My Los Angeles Naughty Girl List. Um... You Mean You're... You're... But You Couldn't Be. Oh, No, No, No. Of Course Not. It's Utterly Impossible, Isn't It, Allie? Oof! Or Should I Use Your Full Name, Hmm? Allison Rachel Thompson. Your Favorite Food Is Thick-Crust Pizza With Sausage And Extra Cheese. You Have A Big Crush On Blake Lynch, Who Sits Near You In English Class, And Your Best Friend Is Samantha Elizabeth Kwan. I Love It When He Does This. Yeah. He's Good. You Are President Of Grant Junior High's Spanish Club. You Brush Your Teeth 3 Times A Day, Which Is Very Good, But You Seldom Floss. Now Do You Believe I'm Santa? No. Anyone Could Have Figured That Out. If You're Really Him, Then Tell Me What I'm Thinking Right Now. He's Santa, Kid, Not The Amazing Kreskin. You Want Something A Little More Personal, Is That It? All Right. Samantha, When You're Alone, You Like To Dance To Ricky Martin Music And Pretend You're Married To Him. You Do? No! Heh Heh Heh Heh. Shall I Go On? No! Allie... Even Though... Your Friends May Think You Have The Perfect Family, We Both Know That Things Aren't Always The Way You'd Like Them To Be. The Fact Is That You, Your Mother And Father And Even Little Joey Are So Busy Going In A Million Different Directions That No One Ever Has Time For One Another. And Even Though You Put On A Brave Face And Act Like It Doesn't Bother You, It Does. Sometimes It Makes You Very, Very Sad. Allie, You Never Told Me That. Ok, So... If You're Santa, Then... Who Are They? Oh, Pardon Me. This Is Crumpet And Sparky, 2 Of My Elves. Elves? Yes. But They're So... Don't Say It! Tall! She Said It. Do You Have A Problem With That? (Doorbell) Good Afternoon. Hi. I'm Edwin Hadley. Channel 3 Action Now News. Oh, Hello! I Didn't Recognize You. M-May I Come In? Yeah, Um... Excuse Me. I'm So Sorry. Is There Something I Can Help You With? Congratulations! You've... Won Our Special Contest, An Afternoon With Edwin. Really? Oh! Well... Well, That's Great. I--I Don't Remember Entering Any Contest. What A Lovely Place! So Bright. So Festive! So... What's That? The Kids Did That. It's Our Substitute Christmas Tree. We Couldn't Get A Real One Because The Storm-- Yes! The Storm. What Do You Make Of Our Little Storm? Um... It's A Bad Storm... Uh...When Do You Think It's Going To End? I Was Hoping You Could Tell Me That. Me? Excuse Me? Who's This? That's My Husband. Is He In Some Kind Of Government Work? Some Sort Of, "Can't Tell Ya, Gotta Kill Ya" Operation? No! He's In Software. Hmm. Uh...Would You Like Some Coffee? Everything All Right? Yes, Fine. Just Admiring Your Handiwork. What Did You Say? I Asked You If You Would Like Some Coffee. No. Never Touch The Stuff. Wait. Yes. Ok, Uh... How Do You Take It? Cream? Sugar? Both. But I'll Mix Them Myself Out Here. Ok. Both! And If It Isn't Too Much Trouble, I'd Like Some Cookies, And Candy, Maybe Some Nuts, A Bowl Of Fruit, Popcorn, Toast With Butter, Maybe A Pot Roast. I'll See What I Can Do. Yams, If You Have Them. A Snow Day, Huh? We Kinda Had A Paper Due. And I Tried To Shut Off The Machine A Bunch Of Times. Honest. It's Very Temperamental. It Took Me Over 2 Months To Build It. But, Santa, I Thought You Worked At The North Pole. Well, Normally I Do, But There Are So Many Distractions At The North Pole, Especially At This Time Of The Year. I Thought I Finally Had The Machine Finished On Thursday, And I Was Going To Go Back, But Then When It Started To Do All Sorts Of Odd Things, Like Raining When It Should Be Snowing And Snowing When It Should Be Sunny And-- And That's Why You Got Frustrated And Threw It Away. Exactly. But It's Such An Important Machine. Very Important. Extremely Important. Why? "Why?" "Why?" This Kid Is Funny. Yeah, Why? We Never Understood That, Either. It's Important Because I Wanted To Give People The Ultimate Christmas Present. A Gentle, White Snowfall So Simple And So Pure That We Would All Just Stop Rushing Around And Take A Few Moments To Be Reminded Of The Magic Of The Season. Ah. Mmm. It's All My Fault, Santa. If I Hadn't Been Such A Total Lame-O And Just Written My Paper Like I Was Supposed To, None Of This Would Have Happened. I'm So Sorry, Santa. (Sniffs) There'll Be Plenty Of Time To Talk About That Later. The Important Thing Right Now Is To Stop This Storm! Now, Where Is The Machine? Mom! Mom! Oh! Oh! Mom! Whoa! Where'd You Get That, Little Boy? I Found It! Found It? You Mean Stole It, Don't You? You Know What Happens To Little Boys Who Steal! I Didn't Steal It! I Found It! They Go To Jail! For A Long Time! Sometimes Forever! I Don't Want To Go To Jail! Why Don't You Hand It Over To Me, And I'll See What I Can Do. There You Go. Go On Now! Aaahh! A Weather-Making Machine! From Now On,I Will Be The Greatest Weatherman In The World, Because I...Will Control...The Weather! Ha Ha Ha Ha! (Coughs) Hi, Honey. It's Me. Um, I Hope You Check Your Voice Mail. Um, Did You Enter A Contest? Mom, I Didn't Steal It! I Found It, And It's Making Snow, And The Man Says I Could Go To Jail, Maybe Forever! Ok, Wait. Slow Down. What Did You Say? I'm Sorry. I'm Not Understanding You. You're Going Too Fast. We Have To Find A Way To Distract Her. Have You Ever Played Ding-Dong-Ditch? Uh-Uh. Uh-Uh. Wh-What Did You Steal? What's Making Snow? Upstairs! (Doorbell Rings) Just A Second. But, Mom! Hello?! Hello?! Ah! Hello?! (Giggling) It's Snowing In Allie's Room! Joey, Please. I've Got Enough Problems Right Now, Ok? Alrighty! Where'd The Tv Guy Go? Mom! Hey! Who Are You? It's That Boring Weatherman From Tv. Edwin, Give Me The Machine. Give Me The Weather Machine, Edwin. Never! Edwin... Edwin... Whoa...Ahh! (Gasps) Let's Take The Stairs. Whoa! Ah! Arr! No One Ever Believes Me! Hey Joey! This Is Santa And His Elf. Pleased To Meet You, Joey. Don't Tell Mom, Ok? Coochie-Coochie! Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! Stop! Stop! Stop! I Know A Shortcut! Please, Not Another Shortcut! (Panting) Sparky, Come On! Ok! Nothing Can Stop Me Now! Stop! Aah! Aah! Waah! Come On! He Passed Through This Candy Factory! My...My Snowmobile! It's Ok, Horace. Perhaps Santa Will Bring You A New One For Christmas, Hmm? (Santa Chuckles) Let's Go. (Footsteps Echoing) Crumpet: Now, Where Could He Have Gone? It's Like He Vanished. Santa: He Disappeared. Over Here! Chocolate Footprints. Come On! They Stop! Huh! Sparky, What Are You Doing? It's Raining Chocolate! Stay Back. Edwin... Give Us The Machine. Please! No, You Can't Have It! I Want It. I Found It, And It's Mine! Sparky... Grr! Rrr, Grr! Stay Back, I Tell You. Back! Stay Down, Sparky, Don't! No! Stay Back! Aah! Get Him! Aah! Santa: Allie, The Machine! Aah! Whew! Oh! Well Done, Allie! Good Job, Al. Whoo! (Gasps) I Hate Cotton Candy! (Gasps) Can't I Have It? I'm Sorry, Edwin. No! Guess I'll Be On My Way. Or Not. Mmm. Mmm. (Hammering) Screwdriver! Wrench! You Realize You Just Can't Keep Me Here Against My Will. I Have A Report To File, After All! Not Now. (Clears Throat) Chewing Gum! Sure, Boss! Ew! Thank You. (Grunts) I'm Stumped. The "Q" Wire Is Attached. The Rhombus Wheel Is Turning. I've Triple-Checked Everything From The Alpha Coil To The Zip Volume. In Theory, This Machine Should Be Working Perfectly. Did You Check The Batteries? Batteries. (Chuckling) Oh, I Always Use My Own Special Brand Of Batteries. Evermerry. Each Battery Lasts 100 Years, So It Couldn't Possibly... Oh, Dear. What's Wrong? I Just Remembered That When I Put The Batteries In, I Was Out Of Evermerrys, So I Used Generic Ones. Quick. Open These Up. (Click, Whirring) I Think It's Working. All Right! Let's Raise The Temperature To 58 Degrees And Bring Up The Sun! (Cheering) Oh, Dear. It's 4:05 Already. Do We Still Have Time? Can We Make Christmas? It'll Be Awfully, Awfully Tight, But Yes, I Think We Can. Boys, Let's Pack Up Everything We Need From Here And Quickly! Oh. Santa, I'm... Really On The "Naughty" List, Aren't I? Yes, But It Isn't A Permanent Situation. It Will Change If You've Learned Something Today. I Have High Hopes For You, Allie Thompson. You're A Trailblazer With A Great Sense Of Adventure. That Sounds Pretty Good. It Is. But It Also Comes With A Great Deal Of Responsibility. It Does? Yes. You Can't Waste All That Energy And Brainpower On Just Skipping Homework Assignments And Taking What Doesn't Belong To You. You Have To Use Them For Things That Are Responsible And Unselfish. Imagine If I Just Decided To Skip Christmas. Think Of All The Billions Of Children Who Would Wake Up On Christmas Morning To Find Their Stockings Empty And Nothing Under The Tree. You Did A Wonderful Job Helping Me Today, Allie, And I'll Never Forget That. Oh, Please. I May Lose My Lunch. Can We Just Get On With This? I Have A Pulitzer Prize To Win. (Sighs) Edwin. Edwin, Edwin, Edwin. I Couldn't Be More Ashamed. I Remember You As A Child, Edwin. You Were Bright, Inquisitive. You Weren't A Crook. What Happened, Edwin? Hmm? What Made You Such A Selfish Snob? What Made You So Mean? It's--It's Not Fair. Hmm. What's Not Fair? Everything! Ever Since I Was A Little Boy, All I Wanted To Be Was A Meteorologist. While Other Kids Were Playing With Toys, I...I Was Busy Playing With Thermometers. They'd Look At The Clouds And See Ponies And Ice-Cream Cones. All I Could See Were Condensed Forms Of Atmospheric Moisture! (Sobbing) Oh, Mr. Martino Was Right. I'm A Failure. Oh, Edwin. Edwin, You're Not A Failure. What You Need Is A New Challenge, A Place Where The Weather Is Exciting, A Place Where You Can Share Your Knowledge With People Who Have The Same Passions That You Do, Hmm? But Where? If I Could Go To Such A Place-- I'll See What I Can Do. Really? Yes. But If And Only If You Promise To Be Good From Now On. No More Lying, Cheating, Or Stealing. Oh, And, Um... Nothing About Our Little Adventure. Do I Have Your Word? As A Gentleman. And More Importantly, As A Meteorologist. But How? You'll See, Edwin. You'll See. Sparky: We're Ready, Santa! Good! Good! Well, Let's Get Moving, Hmm? Christmas Is Upon Us! (Laughs) But First Things First. We Have To Get You Two Home. Um... Santa, I Kind Of Have A Little Favor To Ask. (Whispers) Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mom. Merry Christmas. Thanks, Joey. Now, Allie, I Want To Tell You Straight Up. I'm So Sorry. I Know It's Been A Yucky Christmas, But There Is No Big Present For You Under That Tree, And I Know You Wanted The Rollerblades, And I Tried. I Really Did. But With The Storm, There Was Just No Way. It's Ok, Mom. I'm Really Sorry, Honey. To Tell You The Truth, I Forgot All About Them. Well, There Is Good News. With All My Cancelled Parties, We Are Gonna Be Having Turkey Sandwiches For The Next 5 Years. (Laughs) Mom? Let's Not Open Anything Until Dad Gets Home. Yeah. We Should Wait. Are You Sure? 'Cause It Might Be A While. I Mean, The Airport's Just Reopened. The Roads, Some Of Them Are Still Closed, So, I Mean, There's A Good Chance That He Might Not Even Make It Back Today. Well, We'll Just Wait Until He Does. Joey: Yeah. Ok. Santa: Your Gift Should Arrive Right About... (Car Horn Honking) Hey, Everybody! Allie! Joey! It's Dad! Hey! Kids, I'm Home! Dad! Dad, You're Home! Hey! Whoa! Merry Christmas, Buddy! How Did You Manage To Get A Ride In That? Oh, Well, The Flights Were All Booked Up, And I Was In This Never-Ending Line For A Rental Car, When I Met These Two Guys Who Said They Were Going My Way. Hey, Thanks, Guys. Merry Christmas! They Have The Strangest Names. Sparket And Crumpy. Sparky And Crumpet. How Did You Know That? It's Kind Of A Long Story. Oh! This Has Your Name On It. Oh, Honey! Oh, I Don't Believe It! How Did You-- I Thought It Was Pretty Appropriate, Considering. You Know, Even With The Blizzard I Would Have Found A Way To Get Here, One Way Or Another. I Love You So Much. I Love You, Too. In Fact, I Love All Of You So Much, And Being Here Is... I Don't Know, It's... The Ultimate Christmas Present? That's Exactly Right, Allie. It's The Ultimate Christmas Present. Thank You, Santa. (Santa Chuckles) You're Welcome, Allie. Samantha: Allie! Mrs. Kwan: Merry Christmas! (Shrieks) Good Morning, Class, And Welcome To The South Pole! Campus To The Edwin Hadley Meteorological Institute. In The Next 6 Months, You'll Be Learning Everything From Tracking Storm Clouds To Measuring Levels Of Precipitation To Assessing Ozone Layers. This Class Will Be Technical. This Class Will Be Difficult. He's So Cool! And Most Important, It'll Be Fun! What Do You Say? Are You Ready? (Cheering)
