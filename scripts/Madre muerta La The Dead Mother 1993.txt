Sit down. -What did you want? -How are you getting on? -You must miss your family. -Not at all. l'm of more use here. No one is indispensable. -ls it about yesterday's meeting? -What? l had to go out three times in one hour, but... No, l know about your bladder problem. lf l'm nervous, it's worse. Awful. No, this is something less official. Leire? ls it that obvious? Yes... No! -How do you think she is? -Apart from the diabetes? Of course. To be quite honest... just the same. She's so strange. You should really ask Begona and Ana. l'd rather ask you. l've only been here for two months. They're her tutors. l'm just an assistant. But she's different with you. She doesn't look at you the same. You should ask them anyway. l didn't mean to put you on the spot. l'm sorry. And l'd rather you didn't. l'm sorry. Do you think she could be adopted? She has Mrs. Millas. But who'd adopt someone so old, who doesn't even speak? l would. You think she's better with that old woman? lsmael? -What's wrong? -Wrong? ls something wrong? l waited yesterday, but you didn't come to bed. -You shouldn't have waited. -And today? And today? And tomorrow? l've got my own room, remember? You're going out? Fine, that's right. l'm going out, see? -Please, stay. We have to talk. -Talk? What for? Since when do we have to talk? lf you go out, l'll kill you! l'll kill you! Don't go, you son of a bitch! Please. Swear again, and l'll thump you. -Why do you stay with me? Why? -l don't know. Why? Sleep with me today or l'll kill myself! -l will, you bastard! -Stop swearing! -Son of a bitch! -Shut up! l can't stand that talk. Why are you with me? Get out of my way! My love. Sorry, we're closed. There's no action until 9.00. See what happens when you leave the fucking door open. lt stinks here. lt stinks? Just close the fucking door. What the hell's going on now? ls there something to fucking see? Must you swear all the time? What? What are you doing? -l went to your room... -l don't know. -lnsomnia. -lnsomnia? You've never had that. l was taking a shit and l forgot to lift the cover. You see? That's it! Here. Drop by once a week and check the fucking fridge. l'll pay you the rest when l get back. You understand, right? l didn't build this up by trusting people. That's good. l like guys with tight mouths. And women with big pussies, just like you do, l guess. For Crissake, the fucking door is open again! Give me a beer and l'm off. Well, fuck me. The guy goes, and opens it in my fucking face. Would you quit swearing? A beer, you said? Fuck the beer! l shut the door so l don't get screwed like yesterday, and you just go and open it again? The bastard isn't even listening! Listen, fucker! l want the door shut and l mean shut tighter than a trucker's ass! -Don't shut it. -What? Why not clean up outside and you can watch the girls? Quit dicking me around. Shut the fucking door! What are you doing? Listen, stop fucking around, and get me a beer. What? What the hell is it now? Do l have to serve myself in my own fucking bar? Get me the fucking beer! For Crissake! Well then? Son of a bitch, what are you doing? Carlos, you're crazy! That's the problem. l'm not crazy. Your beer... My name isn't Carlos. My name is lsmael... Lopez... de Matauko. l'll have to be careful for a while. l should've done it the first day. How could you? You're crazy. We've hardly any money. You should've seen him. ''Carlos, you're crazy!''. lnto the basket! You're a clown! Any chocolate? We'll have to leave, like always. We won't find another house. We kick down a door, and we've got a house. Not like this one. We needn't leave. No one'll be in the bar for weeks. And when they find him? Who's seen my face? A few hookers. Businessmen who've never been there? Nobodies. But we must be careful. Like always. Come here. Leire! Dani, come here. Rafa, take him. Leire, l'm Blanca. Look at me, look at me. Look at me! Let's go inside. The little boy's all right. Come on. -l'm going to kill her. -What? Who? The restorer's daughter. But she was a child. -When did you see her? -She's grown up. And she knows me. So long, love. How did it go? -Where is she? -Upstairs, in the garnet room. Why bring her here? There were problems. The old woman she lived with split her skull. By accident? Yeah. And it's better that way. lt looks as if the girl ran away. lt's still early. Later l'll take her to the railway line. Some trains will be passing then. There've been accidents there, but you could be seen. There's never anyone there. Why not put her in a wagon and send her far away? Try and say something even more stupid. ''Why not put her in a wagon?''. And why not put your l.D. in her hand, love? She's harmless. l don't think she knows anything. Why was that open? She isn't what she seems. She remembers, and she knows me. l'll do what l didn't do that day. -What's wrong? -Nothing. This is the first day in ages we haven't argued. How nice, my love. You should kidnap people more often. lt's so cold upstairs. Look, she likes chocolate, same as you do, it's funny. What's that smell? She dirtied herself. -She stinks. -She smells like a child. She'll shit herself even more. lsmael... Why not ask for a ransom first? Did you hear? We need money. So go on the streets. What are you doing? Tell me! What are you doing? Don't eat that! lt's dirty! Do you understand? Dirty! You're very pretty. l had to change her. She isn't toilet trained yet. We'll ask for a lot. -We must find a relative. -l don't think we'll get much. We should do it tomorrow. We'll see. We should think it over. We could contact the clinic. They're responsible for her. They'll get the money. They wouldn't risk it. We have to find out who to ask, and how. -lt's not so easy. -We can't risk waiting too long. We can't risk messing it up. Leave it to me. And in the meantime? You don't change her, or feed her! Must you do that now? lt stinks! Don't. Open it a bit. -And after? -After what? After we get the money. l'll take her to the police with our photos, so she can turn us in. What do you think? They'll feel bad if they pay and then we kill her. We won't kill her. Remember? The train... Very clever. She doesn't laugh. What? She doesn't laugh? No, never. All kids laugh. She doesn't talk, that's even worse. Talking isn't important. l love you. You say it to me. Stay with Luci, all right? lsn't she back? No, she won't come tonight. And that woman has no phone. Why would she? She's deaf. Anyway, who'd call her? Don't worry, this has happened before. She can't go on living with that old woman. -She isn't bad to her. -She should inform us. We'll see tomorrow. Well... Why are you in here? l don't know, l fell asleep. Fuck me, you don't say. And your insomnia? l don't know. l don't trust the girl. l was checking. She's not a child. And don't swear. You don't trust her? No, l don't trust her. Then tie her up. l should what? That's enough. What? Aren't you going up? Don't you like the chain? Should l get something else? A rope? l said that's enough. Will you trust her tonight? Aren't you making a bit of a fuss? She may not have a brain but she's got legs. That's all she needs to get away. Before, you didn't trust anybody, not her, or me. She can't reach this. -And who could loosen this? -How should l know? You see? She never laughs. What? lt isn't normal. lt isn't normal that she's still here. You're not listening. When are we going to do it? We're taking a stupid risk. We'll do it when we know how. Soon. -So long. -See you tomorrow. Excuse me. Do you work here? Who is the director of the asylum? -Well, actually it's a clinic. -l know what it is. -The director is a woman. -lt's about a relative of mine. l think we'll have to bring him here. l understand. The director has left. You could ring tomorrow. Yeah, but l think l'll drop by. Thanks. You're welcome. Why don't you laugh? l used to be funny. Not anymore. Hello, l'm a clown, and you're a bad girl because you won't laugh. And that's why... That's why l'm going to do a dance for you now! Here we go. Wave your hands in front, then wave them behind. Like that? She won't laugh. Well, we'll have to try something else then! Now... l'm going to be Superman! Now l'm a flea man and l'm going to ''prerform'' for you. On the count of three, l'll hop up here! That's one! And now l'll go higher at the count of two. And now on the count of three, that's it! Truly ''emazing''! And now l'm going to jump head first to make this girl laugh. To make this girl laugh. On the count of one... On the count of two, and of... Three! We won't make any more noise or Maite will scold us. She won't laugh. No matter! Because now... l'm going to find... your tickles! Here's the horn! You smell so nice. You smell of chocolate. -Miss Armentia? A call for you. -No, this isn't... Susana. -Victoria de Lecea Clinic? -That's right. -Let me speak to the director. -She's busy just now... lt'll just be a minute. Tell her it's about the painter's daughter. Hello? Yes, just a moment. She's coming now. Good morning. Who is this? Who is that? l am Osane Lopez de Armentia, director of this... Listen. We have the daughter of the dead painter. We want money. -Did you hear? -Perfectly, Miss... What was your name? Very funny. Look, Osana... Osane, please. Listen to me. We'll ring tomorrow at 7.00. ln the meantime, think where to get the money. What money? We want 20 million. Did you hear? What about Leire? How is she? Fine. Hi. Who are you talking to? What did you say? Say hello for me. Look, this isn't a joke. You'll know for sure by tomorrow. l needn't warn you not to tell anyone else. Where do you expect me to find the money? You run that asylum, right? You'll manage it. -Did you want me? -No, well, yes. Just to say l might call Mrs. Millas' house today. -Keep me informed. -Yes, l will, don't worry. Mrs. Millas! -You really like Truffaut? -l like anything with guns. Come on, let's go. Leire? My God! The bastards! Let's get out of here. God knows where we'll go. We could have gone in. You saw the photos. lt was a love story! Shit! Hang on, Leire. l really got to pee... Look. Look at what l have. You'll like this. Like that? That's it. Now, l'll put it away. Bastard! Bastard! Shit, when did he go? Maite? What? Get my cigarettes. All right. Hello, little Red Riding Hood. Are you lost? Or are you here to steal? Well, now. l hate cigarettes. They're disgusting. What did you say? Who's that? How did she get here? Come on, you're not with the cops. How did you get here? How? l followed her. How strange. Here. You brought her. You get rid of her. Cheer up. -You shouldn't have come. -l told nobody. l swear it. l believe you. Leire... l only went there once. l don't know how she knew, it's witchcraft. Apologize once more... and l'll kill you. We must leave. She might have friends. She said no. ''She said no. She said no''. She didn't say she was doing a TV report on two kidnappers! Cut it out! When will you do it? lt's been a week. Are you going to do it? Am l going to do it? You wanted the money! l'll do it. When we have the fucking money! Forget about the money. Kill her now, please. Forget about the money? No, l won't. Where are you going? -To the old cathedral. -St. Prudence's? Why? We can't stay here. l'll see if it's still empty. And don't open the door! What are you doing? Hold me. What have you done? Please... What were you doing? Come on. The choir stall. Now what? Right to the end. We've got a house. Yeah... it's great. Bastard... ''Mysterious death of the owner of La Concha de Plata''. Nothing else? Yes. They report the disappearance of the nurse and the girl. They went to the old woman's house. But they don't understand how she died. All they know is that something has happened. Do you believe that? Carlos! You're crazy! Carlos! Asshole! Do you believe it? What are we going to do? Nothing! The girl didn't tell them anything. So she wasn't lying. lf we get rid of the body, we can go back home. We'll wait a bit longer. And the girl? When will you do it? There are too many bodies now to ask for the money. Just forget about it. l already had. l can add up too. And what about the girl? Are you going to keep acting stupid? Never say anything like that again. Understand? Never! -l'm going to kill her. -No, you won't. l'm going to kill her, right? Tell me! When? l don't know. Tomorrow. No... now. That's it, l'll kill her now. Or better still... Next year. That's it. Now... Now l'll kill you. That's enough, please. What? What? What's enough? What am l going to do? l don't know. ''l don't know''. Now, here's a question. -What do l do with the girl? -l don't know. Kill her. Very good, that's right. How? l don't know. -Under a train. -Good idea. l'm going to push her under a train. When will l do it? On your own. No help. l don't know. Never. When? When you want to. Very good. l'm going to push her under a train. When l want to! When l want to! Me! Me! All right. No more questions. -Better? -Yes. l'm glad. l feel better too. We're all happy. Bastard! Son of a bitch! l knew it. l knew it all the time. l was sure of it. Stop shouting. You like her because she's a child, don't you? You're a fucking pig, a perverted bastard! Don't shout. lt isn't true. You like little girls. l thought so. You're sick! Keep away, don't touch me! Don't dare! l'm telling you nicely, that's all a lie. You lied to me, you've lied from the start. You never wanted to kill her. l've asked you nicely. l'll try another way. See what happens? You're really just a coward. A filthy, degenerate coward. That's why you'll never do it, because you can't. lt's too much, even for you. Shut up! What is it l can't do? l'll do what l have to do... like always. l did it before. Get out of the way! -Look! -What's that? You shot her? You shot the child too? You never told me. You must kill her. She's not like you think. What do l think? She knows what's happening. l've seen it in her eyes. What are you saying? She's controlling us. Think about it. What's happened since she came? Your job, then the deaths. Our house... -Ours? -Don't you see it? No, l don't. There's evil in her. That's good coming from you. ''There's evil in her''. You know l'm right. lt's something dark. lf you'd seen how she looked at me at the garret. She's pretending now. She's fooled us. lt's impossible. But don't you understand? Don't you see what she's doing? She's taking her revenge on you! l won't listen to that rubbish. Let's get this... darn thing finished! You can't kill her! She's dead already. lt's gone. Shut up! Shut up! Understand? Shut up! l knew you wouldn't do it. Now we're alone. Are you going to shoot? Come on! Come on! Shoot! Not at you. You have to do it. You're shit. Where are you going? The operating room? Are you a surgeon? Come on, you! You can't go in there. Hey! Give me my jacket. Let's get out of here. Drop dead. Hey! You have to come with me. Don't cry, it's mine. See? Miguel! lt's mine, see? What are you doing, pervert? Get the hell out of here. Take it easy, man. Calm down, all right? Take it easy. Lay off, bastard! Come on, Leire.
