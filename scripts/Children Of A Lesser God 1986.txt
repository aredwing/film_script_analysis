And you've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill. Pittsburgh. Bartender. And a disc jockey. In Oklahoma. I used to broadcast in sign language. You've been all over the map. I've got a lot of energy. I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas. I did, too, when... But nobody's trying to change the world around here. Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all. Everything else is razzle-dazzle. Am I, uh... am I making myself clear? Yes, I believe that you are. [Buzzing] Are we being punished? Hi. I'm James Leeds, and... my signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips? No one? O.K. Class dismissed. No, no, no. No, no, no. Just testing. Sit down. Lydia and Tony, good lip readers. Would you mind closing your notebook? Thank you. Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak. Tony. To pick up hearing girls. To pick up hearing girls. O.K. Let's work on this. All right. Now... here. You. You. O.K. Here are two beautiful hearing girls. You two guys want to pick them up. What is the first thing you want to say, Danny? Are you rich? Are you r-i-i-ch? Say it. Rich. Good. Lydia. I'm very rich. Good. Tony. Let's go somewhere and do it. No, thank you. Let's go somewhere and do it- t. I would rather do it with her. Cute. How about you guys? You want to join us? They don't talk. Fair enough. O.K. Reasons to talk. Right. If your hands are occupied. For example, some guy owes you money. He comes by, but you just happen to be in a handstand. How will you tell him to give you your money? You can't use your hands. You've got to speak. Give me my money, you bum. Call me names, will you? I don't have to stand here and take that. You want to fight, huh? O.K. Put up your feet and fight like a man. See? [Crash] Take your pots... and your lousy food and shove them... Doesn't mince words, does she? Mr. Leeds. Mr. Leeds. Oh, Leeds! Leeds! Join us. Sure. O.K. Sorry. Good thing you're out of my classroom. Sit down, James. Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent. Orin Dennis, math and social studies. James Leeds. Leeds. Hi. Did I hear Miss Ochs say you were one of her students? Yes. I started here at 5. Really? Wow, that's great. I'm impressed. For still being here? Not what I meant. See you all later. Bye. Who is that? That's Sarah. Never mind her. She's a pain in the ass. But who is she? What does she do? She works here. Orin, I've got an idea. How about the kids making potholders for parents' day? They don't sell. We've got hundreds left from last year. We do? Oh. We do? Oh. Sarah came here at 5, too. We grew up together. Is she a teacher, too? She was one of our brightest students. Would you give me some of the water? Thank you. Leeds, you're a genius. You will work. [Classical Music Plays] Ooh. Yeah. Mr. Bach. Hear that... cat? Ooh. Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang. Again. Faster. Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang. One more time, faster. Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang. Great. Right. That is great. Brilliant. My Lydia. Come here, Lydia. O.K. Put your hands on the speaker. Come on. [Music Plays] Feel that? Good. Feel it. Like a boomerang, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Love can turn, turn around now  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Use your voice. Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Yeah. Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  My heart can feel ya  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Close enough to steal ya  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Don't slip by, now  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Don't you know that I'll be comin'back to find ya  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  You know a boy can change direction  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Givin'you love and affection  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Bein'sweeter  Sweeter  Like a boomerang, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Love can turn, turn around now  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Like a boomerang, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Ooh, your love can turn around  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Ooh, my love is gonna catch ya  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  It's comin'back to get ya  It's good that I met ya  Not givin'up  'Cause now I'm gonna try to get ya  You know a boy can change direction  Bringin'you love and protection  Baby, baby, baby  A drip. [Very Loud] Oh! What a drip! No. No. No! No! That's not what I meant. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm James Leeds. It's Sarah, isn't it? Would you like to sit down? Right here. O.K. We'll both stand up. Oh, I see. Very good. You got me there. Could you look at me, please? If you don't look at me, I can't... So, um... Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5. Mm-hmm. Um... when did you graduate? And, uh, now... now... now you work here? Are you reading my lips? I don't think that you are reading my lips. Ohhh... Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it? You could've told me. Why? I don't know. How about common courtesy? How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor? Man... you know, if you let me, I bet I could teach you how to speak. And you could teach me... but I don't want to mop the floor. Gee, that was quick. And you don't want to speak. Brilliant. Schmuck. It's a damn shame. Costly, too. Resodding is damn costly. No. I'm talking about Sarah Norman. Right. Sarah. Look at this, will you? What a mess. Has she ever tried speaking? Sarah's not hard of hearing. She's totally deaf. Born that way. That makes it tough. The rain's lousing up the fields. It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets. Doesn't bother her. Oh, no? Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star. Sarah is content. She had a rotten childhood. She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7. We let her know how smart she was. For what? She's productive. Pays taxes. Oh, brother. All right. You want to try? I'll talk to her. Huh? I'll talk to her. Look at this. Will you look at this? Damn! It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least. Oh, brother. S-S-Sat. Sat. All right. [Bell Rings] That's good. You have to work on S's, though. O.K.? Go. Out. James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour. She's really looking forward to it. You're really looking forward to it, aren't you? What did I tell you? Well, uh... have fun, Jim... as usual. Well, Sarah, uh... yeah. I do mind, actually. Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead. Listen... how would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good? I'm sorry. I didn't get that. Uh... if... I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech. No. I'm all out of jokes. Good. I'm not funny. Oh, yeah? If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream. You're deaf? Well, I'll try to remember that. I'll forget? No, I won't. Listen, um... why don't we get this thing started here? Well, thank you for stopping by. The pleasure was mine. God. My mama. Your mama. Great. Go. Glen, who's your favorite person? Twisted Sister? Twisted Sister? It's the name of the rock group. Oh. Oh. Try saying that. Twisted Sister. Glen, it takes courage. I know. Just give me one sound. One. "T." "T." Try. "T." "T." Tweeh... That's great. That's great. Yeah. Out of here. Go. Great. Johnny? Who's your favorite person? Princess Di? Benji? No. Terminator? Uh... [Bell Rings] Hey. Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again? Whoa, careful, you almost smiled. Ah, that's a girl. That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love. If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here? There's a whole empty beach. Unbelievable. I tried to call your mother. Hey. Hold it. Wait. Wait. I can't... I didn't even talk to her. O.K.? I mean, can we stop this? I mean, why can't we... I mean, why can't we just... why don't we... why don't we... go out and have some dinner tonight? Huh? Just give me a yes or a no. Yes? Good. I think. O.K. Um... I will meet you behind, uh... the girls' dormitory, I will whisper your name. Hey! I know that sign. That's the first sign I ever learned. It's in Italian. Can I suggest something? Will you give me a break? My Italian is worse than my signing. The veal piccata is very good. Look. I'm sorry. V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A. I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it. It's veal. It's, uh... sauteed in lemon and butter. What's veal? Uh... God. What the hell is veal? Um... Good evening. Something to drink this evening? You want something to drink, Sarah? Our house wine is very nice. You want some wine? Yeah. It's O.K. Uh, white wine. We'll take a carafe, please. He doesn't think you're stupid. He thinks you're deaf. No. Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid. Do you really like being a cleaning woman? Why? Yeah. I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence. Not with toilet bowl cleaner? You should have told me that was the attraction. You are smart as hell, you know? You want to dance? Can you feel it? Vibrations... through your nose! Ain't nobody worried  Ain't no smilin' faces  I'm not good at this. And you are. Great. Lyin' to the races  Help me  Come on  Come on  Somebody help me, now  I'll take you there  Help me, y'all  I'll take you there  Help me, now  I'll take you there  Oh... ooh  I'll take you there  Oh, oh  Mercy  I'll take you there  Oh  Let me take you there  I'll take you there  Oh  Let me  Take you there  Play it, Larry  Play your  Play your piano, now  All right  Ah  Do it  Do it  Come on, now  Play on it  Play on it  Daddy, now  Daddy, Daddy, Daddy  Mmm  Mmm  Ooh, Lord  All right  Now  Oh, I  I know a place, y'all  I'll take you there  Ain't nobody worried, y'all  I'll take you there  Mercy, now  I'll take you there  I'm callin'  Callin', callin' for mercy  I'll take you there  Mercy, mercy  I'll take you there  I've been  Loving you  Too long  To stop now  You were tied  And you want to be free  My love is going strong, girl  As you become a habit to me  Ooh, I'm loving you  A little too long...  I don't know why I became a speech teacher. O.K.? Let's dance. It's too hard to dance and talk. With you, my life...  Well, maybe I like to hear myself talk. Hmm? Has been so wonderful  Can't stop now...  I am a really good teacher, though. You... You should let me help you. What is that? Lydia does not talk like that. Don't you want to be able to get along in the world? No one wants my help? That's your opinion. That's fine. You don't do anything you can't do well? I don't want to stop now  Oh  Oh, oh  I've been loving you  A little too long  I don't want to stop...  Well, I would like to walk with you. It's... my pleasure. Mrs. Norman? I'm James Leeds. I didn't call again... because I would've hung up again. It's 60 miles here and back. Please, just five minutes. I just got home from work. This is my time to relax. Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing. Five minutes. Well. Well. Uh... let's see. You haven't seen Sarah in eight years? Let's get this straight. Sarah doesn't want to see me. Has she said why? We don't communicate very well. Did you ever learn to sign? Some of the parents... I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me. God. No one's blaming you. Of course they are. They can't blame themselves. So, it's all my fault. Fine. I don't give a damn anymore. I really just came to ask one question. What happened when Sarah tried to speak? What happened? She looked awful. She sounded awful. People made fun of her. What do you think? Who made fun of her? Other kids. Her sister's friends. Then she stopped trying to talk. She's very pretty, you know. Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends. It was wonderful for her. The boys really liked her. They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect. If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal. Hi. It's true. I'm early today. No. Don't go. I wanted to talk to you, anyway. No. I want to hel... work with you. I understand that you're scared. I understand nothing. Sarah! Come back here. Sarah. Yelling at the back of a deaf person. Very good, James. He's been at all the best schools. Why did you stop going home? Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it? Yes. I talked to your mother. Please, let me help you, damn it! How? By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man? I think that's one language you don't speak. Yeah, O.K. I'm so... Come on. I can take it. You have more than enough communication skills. I don't. They never did? O.K. [Stamps Floor] Hey! Who is they? Hearing boys? They could never be bothered to learn my language. I was always expected to learn to speak. Well, I don't speak. Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls. Better! At first, I let them have me because they wanted to. Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me. No introduction, no talk. Just went to a dark place and... They didn't even take me out for a Coke first. That's not what I wanted to know about you. I thought I was such a big deal... coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill. No, Sarah. All the time, you were laughing at me. I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin who spread her legs for every..." You think that I'm threatened by that? You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager? I don't. I don't give a shit! Whoo. Sarah, please listen to me. I'm not going away. I did the wrong thing. I'm sorry. I... I don't know what to say. Tell me what to say. Sarah... you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person I have ever met. I am falling in lo... Sarah... Sarah... I am falling... into the pool with you! God! What a fellow has to go through. My love will get ya  Like a boomerang, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Ba-boom...  How are things going, Jim? Great. Just great. Good. Good. Glad to hear it. We've got to have you to the house. I'd like that. I warn you, though... I'm a poker player. So I've heard. Are you a card player? No, not really. Tic-tac-toe's my game. So much the better, huh? Well... Thanks for coming in, Jim. We're really happy to have you with us. Thank you. Uh-huh. Oh, uh... your size? Yeah. Be careful, Jimbo. Right. Don't fight it. Relax. [Tango Music Plays] Daphne. Hmm? You're leading again. Sorry. I got a funny sensation in my toes... like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame. Let's throw another log on the fire. [Tango Music Plays] Ole! [Jim] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. You are... the... nicest person... I've... ever met. Who, me? I'm the nicest person you've ever met? That's the craziest thing that I ever heard. You thought after what you told me... that you'd never see me again? Here I am. Yeah, I was in love, but... she broke my heart. Oh. Yeah, I know. Please don't break my heart. Did anyone ever break yours? You don't hurt from other people? You never hurt from other people? That's not true. Sarah, I know people have hurt you. I know. Suppose you admitted that you hurt. I'd... shrivel up and... I'll take care of you, Sarah. I'll take care of you. What do you mean, that was my foul? You moved into me. You want to call me an asshole, say it. No. Say it out loud. Watch my lips. Asshole. Ah-hole. Ass... hole. Ass-hole. Great! Asshole. Good. It was still your foul. Asshole! Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day? Wha... That's true. I just made it up. You do? What do waves sound like? Whoo. That is what they sound like. How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful? And pigheaded. You're the most stubborn person. Yeah, you. You're not stubborn? O.K. Hi, beautiful. What am I saying? Wait. Sarah, that was a joke. It wasn't funny. O.K., I won't do it again. I promise. Sarah... I promise. Come on! Mr. Harrison! How are you? Couldn't be better, Curtis. Ah-ha. Jim Harrison. He donated the chemistry lab. Your boy Glen is coming along. He's a fine lad. Has he changed that idiotic haircut? No. I like to give the kids a lot of leeway. Asshole! Shit For Brains! Look at those shingles. Guess they'll all have to be replaced. [Applause] Thank you, Mr. Jones' class for your informative demonstration of the importance of the four food groups. has a special treat for us. [Rock Music Plays] Like a boomerang, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Love can turn, turn around now  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Like a boomerang, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Love can turn around  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  My heart can feel ya  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Close enough to steal ya  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Don't slip by, now  Don't you know that I'll be comin'back to find ya  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  You know a boy can change direction  Bringin'you love and affection  Baby, baby  Ooh, and it's sweeter, sweeter  Sweeter, sweeter  Like a boomerang, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Love can turn, turn around now  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Like a boomerang, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Ooh, love can turn around  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  My love didn't catch ya  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  But it's comin'back at ya  Like a boomerang, baby  Glen is singing.

I'm very impressed. Anything that works, Edward. Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Comin'at you, baby  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Love can turn around on you  Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang  Where did they leave it? In here. Where in here? What did they do? Just a cut, huh? It's five stitches, huh? You stupid son of... She could have seriously hurt herself... in front of a parent. It's going to stop now. What? I don't know what made her upset. You've got no right to mess her up! She is not messed up. I'm not discussing this. Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students. She's no student! She's a 25-year-old woman! Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees. It's going to stop! She's quitting her job! She's what? She's quitting. She's moving in with me! Oh. Oh, I see. She's going to be your maid now, huh? Jesus Christ, Franklin. James, James... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That wasn't fair. That wasn't fair to Sarah, either. I've seen this kind of thing before. It just doesn't work! This isn't this kind of thing. This is us. This is Sarah and me. I love her! Sure, the kids made me happy. Is that against the law? I don't hate you for not learning how to speak. Sarah... Sarah, I... Iove you. I need you. Where are your suitcases? Aha! [Stamps On Floor] It's your suitcase. You are moving in with me today. Here. I'm packing your clothes. You'll need some clothes. Now, it's your turn. Screw your job. I got mine. You can do whatever you want. Sarah... what do you want? Me. You got me. What else? Children. You want... deaf children? What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children? No, I don't. But if they were, that would be fine. Ah. Could you get me some more, too? I don't think she heard me. Mr. Leeds! I don't think you're an asshole anymore. No? No. I think you're a... dick-brain. Dick-brain? That's fantastic. I got it right away. Yeah, Dick-brain. Really excellent. Good work. Choo choo choo choo.

[Doorbell Rings] I'll get it. This is great. I cannot believe this... James. And Sarah! Oh, come in. Come in, please. Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too. You've taught her to play poker? Not me. She learned it out of a book. Well, about that time. Sarah knows how to play poker? It's good to see you again. You look... mmm! Here. Sit next to me. No, no, no. No couples together. Let's break it up. Come on, break it up. Sarah... no cheating. Don't start, Curtis. I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits. Come on. Oh, yes. Those little signs that no one will see. Very funny, Franklin. Don't pay attention to him. With Jim, of course. Together, you can clean up. Jim won't cheat. He's not deaf. That's very good. Very good, Sarah. Very good. High card deals. You're high. You deal. Nickel, dime, and quarter. All of them? Yes. Ante up, everybody. Out of a book, huh? Five card draw. One-eyed jacks wild. One-eyed jacks wild? One-eyed jacks. O.K. You're doing great with her, Jim. Yeah, what a change. Pretty impressive, James. What about the poor guys that lost? Want these here or in the kitchen? No, I'll clean up. It's no bother. It's fine. I can't believe how well she played. There goes my mad money. Great. James... where can I get a copy of that book? You are smart. She bluffed me. I folded with three of a kind. Did you teach her that? Quite a coup, James. A lesson for us all. Oh, God. God, I can't ever get close enough. Say my name. Just once, say my name. I'm sorry. I need it... I'm... I know I promised. I'm sorry. I forgot. I... I'm not lying. I don't want you to speak. It just came out. Please, it just... I'm sorry. Hike! No. No. I don't care! They killed my brother. Don't kill him! Don't shoot! They'll shoot you, too! Get out of my way! Shoot please! Do it for me! [Gunshots] Can we have some soda? Yes. [Telephone Rings] The phone is ringing. What? The phone is ringing. What phone? The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy. Turn that damn thing down. Good grief. What am I saying? [Ring] The phone is ringing. The TV is blasting. [Teakettle Whistles] The kettle... If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window. [Gunshots] Can you hold on? That would be great. Water's boiling. Hello. What? Ask him to hang on for a second. [Tires Squealing] It's for you. It's one of the dorm counselors. He's translating a call from a deaf man. It's Orin. Lydia, Danny! For god's sake... It's over. Bye. Thank God for small favors. O.K. You still there? Great. You both ready? We're both ready. This is Sarah speaking to Orin. Hi. Why are you calling? I'm having a small dinner party. I want you to come, please. How about me, please? Don't translate that to Orin. Please. No, I'm not saying please. Wait a minute. That was Orin saying please. Look, it's my fault. I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin. He wants you to come to a party for... Marian Loesser. Please. Great. Um... She is dying to see you. Bring James! Friday at 7:00. O.K. Fine. We'll be there. Yeah. Thank you. My God. Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here. I do not make everything into a joke. I possibly obscure... How the hell would you sign "obscure"? Obscure. I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to You know... I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you... Hold it. That sounds like... like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music. Thank you. I will. I'll rest my hands... and listen to something beautiful. [Bach Plays] I can't enjoy it. I can't, because you can't. [Bach Plays] Show you the music? Let's see... I can't. Don't be sad for you. All right, I won't. What should you wear to the party? I don't know. Have I ever heard of who? Oh, Marian. She's the lady the party's for? No. Should I have? She's very famous in the deaf community. Nice catch. She has two Ph.D. s, and she doesn't speak. Take a look at these. Hungry? I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself. You're right. I'm sorry. What do you hear? I mean, is it just silence? No one has ever gotten in there to find out? Will you ever let me in? She's something, isn't she? Is she a lawyer or something? Uh-uh. An economist in Washington. A real math whiz. How thrilling. Yeah. It is. I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there. I know the feeling. Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave. All right. Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight? I'll wait. Sure. Marian's great. So what? She has everything. Education. Great job. Money. Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got. Me. Oh, we're not talking about me for once. That's true. Hey... Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some... romantic, distant place. We're not. We're here. Right. O.K. Let's deal with it. What is making you so miserable? Oh... Let's go to sleep? No. You can't start a bonfire and then say night- night. And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either. Oh, you can do anything you want? Yeah, like what? Nothing. I can do nothing. I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing. You feel like an idiot. I treat you like an idiot? I pity you? Wait a second. And now you see Marian... What about Marian? Let you be you? I don't? I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person? I don't want to help anybody. I just want to change and control... Good night. No... you think that I want you to speak. And you just want to be you? Well, who the hell are you? Right. [Stamps Floor] What? God, you want to make love now? Fuck you, lady. Oh, that's what you want. You understood that. That didn't help much. Oh, it helped you? Great. That's really wonderful. Makes me happy. What a night. I think that helped. Yeah? What have you just decided? No one's ever going to speak for you again? Come on. How are you going to manage? Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them. "She wants, she thinks." And most of the time they were wrong. They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought. And now they won't. Well, that's all right. I'll buy that. No, I won't. How could I? Because I love you. Love has nothing to do with it? That's wonderful. Then what the hell have we been doing? Watch your hands? It's hard to avoid them. This sign... to connect... simple. But it means so much more when I do this. Now it means... to be joined in a relationship. Separate, but one. That's what I want. But you think for me, think for Sarah. As though there were no "I." She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak. That's all you, not me. Until you let me be an "I," the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me. And I won't let myself know you. Until that time... we can't be like this... joined. Well... that's all very moving. But... how are you going to manage? You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle... I heard. I heard every word, goddamn it. I translated for myself. It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth. And you know what? I think you're lying. I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful. I think that you're scared to death to try. I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right. You want to be on your own. You don't want to be pitied. Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed. Read my lips. What am I saying? What am... You want to talk to me, then you learn my language. Did you understand that? You've probably been reading lips for years. But that's the great control game, isn't it? I'm the controller? What a fucking joke. Now, come on! Speak to me! Speak! Speak to me! Aah! See my mouth? Aah! Hear my voice? Aah! Aah! I'm not afraid! Hot chocolate. Your favorite. Have you... come... home... to stay? Of course you can. As long as you like. You need a job, but there's nothing. I'll... I'll... I'll help. I... never helped. Don't... hurt me now. The last time, you... we... sent you away because... I didn't know... how to... take care of you. Your father... couldn't accept you. He felt... he'd failed. You're right. I hated you... for... driving him away. Please... forgive me. [Telephone Rings] [Ring] Telephone. What... What should I say? [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Hello. No... I'm sorry, James. No, she's not. All right. I'll call you if I see her. [Bach Plays] Favorite books. Favorite books. Good. Do you have any favorite books, Glen? Yeah. Skull? I'll put that on my summer reading list. I have to see her. I know she doesn't want to see me. She's made that very clear. But I have to see her. She'll let you know when she wants to see you. She's working now. She's saving her money. She wants to go to college. That's fine. That's wonderful. Um... I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman. Please. Spring cleaning. How was your day? Are you O.K.? No. You're not fine. You're lonely. [Music Box Plays] He was here. He misses you. You don't know what to do. I think maybe you do. Hold me  I'll give you all that you need  Wrap your love around me  You're so exciting  I can feel you gettin'hotter  Oh, baby  I'll take you down  I'll take you down  Where no one's ever gone before  And if you want more  If you want more  More  More  Betterjump  For my love  Jump in  And feel my touch  Jump  If you want to taste my kisses  In the night, then  Jump for my love  Jump  I know my heart can make you happy  Jump in  You know these arms can fill you up  Jump  If you want to taste my kisses  In the night, then  Jump  For my love  You told me  I'm the only woman for you...  Have a good summer, William. Language skills can be dangerous. Use a little common sense, O.K.? I will, Mr. Leeds. So long, William. So long, Fuckface. Betterjump  For my love  Jump in  And feel my touch  Jump  If you want to taste my kisses  In the night, then  Jump  For my love, jump  I know my heart can make you happy  Jump in  You know these arms can fill you up  Jump  If you want to taste my kisses  In the night, then  Jump  Jump, jump  Ooh, yeah  You know my heart can make you happy  You know these arms can fill you up  Jump in  If you want to taste my kisses  In the night, dear  Jump  Jump for my love  Ooh-hoo  Come on and jump on in  Jump  You know I need you...  You look beautiful. You wanted to see me. It was a shock, seeing you in there. I didn't know what to do. You were scared, too. I hear that Boomerang song. Ooh, my love can't catch ya  You've been angry since you were a little girl. You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger... to push me away. You're sorry. I'm sorry... for hurting you. But you learned from me. You learned that you can hurt... and you won't shrivel up and blow away. I don't want to be without you, either. Do you think... that we could find a place... where we can meet... not in silence... and not in sound? [Waves Crashing]
