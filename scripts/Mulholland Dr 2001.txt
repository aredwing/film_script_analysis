You're in both dreams, and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are, and... then I realize what it is. There's a man... in back ofthis place. He's the one who's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face. I hope that I never see that face... ever outside of a dream. [ Sniffes ] That's it. So... you came to see ifhe's out there. To get rid ofthis god-awful feeling. Right, then. [ Mouths Words ] He's around here. [ Echoing, Muted ] Dan! Dan, you all right ? Dan! Dan!

Everybody else does. Wait there, and I'll go get the key. Okay, Coco. Wilkins! Wilkins! Ifthat damn dog craps in the courtyard one more time, I'm just gonna bake his little butt for breakfast! You don't have any pets, do you ? Oh, no, I don't. Well, they're allowed. I just don't like them here for obvious reasons. You know, there was a man that lived here once... that had a prizefighting kangaroo. Well, you just wouldn't believe... what that kangaroo did to this courtyard. Let's go see your aunt's apartment. It's a good one. I can hardlywait. [ Chuckles ] It's unbelievable! [ Coco Chuckles ] I toldya. Oh, wow! Well, you and your aunt probably have an understanding, so here's the key.

I couldn't afforda place like this in a millionyears. Unless, of course, I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star. But,you know, sometimes people end up being both. So that is, I guess you'd say, sort ofwhy I came here. I'm sorry. I'm just so excited to be here. I mean, Ijust came here from Deep River, Ontario, and now I'm in this... dream place. Well, you can imagine how I feel. Oh. What-- Sit down. Where were you hurt ? Oh, we should call a doctor.

No, Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't see her. She's sleeping. I'm sure there's some explanation for this. I don't think we have to do that. Please don't worry. Aunt Ruth, we don't need the police. [ Cryi ng Softly ] You're awake. I thi nk I m isunderstood. I thoughtyou knew my aunt, and that's whyyou were here.

Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Will you meet with him? Yeah. Sure. No, it's-it's been that kind of a day. When? Um, I'll call him right away, and then I'll call you back. You know, you-- you could stay at my place ifyou-- ifyou wanted. Uh, Cynthia, no. I don't think that would be a good idea. I was just offering a place to stay. Yes, and I appreciate the offer, Cynthia. I'll find a place. Now, look,just go on and give that Cowboy a yodel and get on back to me. Okay. But you don't know what you're missing. Uh,just get along, little doggie, and call me back. [Replaces Receiver] It's right about here-- Sierra Bonita. It's not too far away. What's wrong with that? I'm not sure about this. I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful, I promise. Tomorrow, we'll go over there... and we'll find out. [Knocking on Door] It'll be okay. [Knocking Continues ] It's probably Coco. Yes? May I help you? Someone is in trouble. Who are you? What are you doing in Ruth's apartment? She's letting me stay here. I'm her niece. My name's Betty. No, it's not. That's not what she said. Someone is in trouble! Something bad is happening! Well, I-I'm sorry, but I don't know whoyou are, and-- Louise? What areyou doing, Louise? I-- Oh, Coco. I've been trying to get a hold ofyou since 3:00 this afternoon. That one is in myroom, andshe won't leave. I want you to get her out. I want you to get her out now! Uh, this is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she meant well. Louise, this is Betty. This is Ruth's niece. I n fact, fortunately I was just on myway over here to see Betty. Betty's a young actress, and I was just delivering... some faxed pages of a scene for a big audition tomorrow. Well, here they are, honey. Oh, thankyou. Come along now, Louise. I'll takeyou home.

Whoa. [ Scoffs ] Cowboy. [ Buzzing ] Howdy. Howdy to you. Beautiful evenin'. Yeah. Sure wanna thankyou for comin' all the way up here to see me... from that nice hotel downtown. No problem. What's on your mind? Well, now, here's a man who wants to get right down to it. Kinda anxious to get to it, areya? Whatever. A man's attitude-- A man's attitude goes some ways... to the way his life will be. Is that something you might agree with? Sure. Now, did you answer... because that's whatyou thought I wanted to hear, or did you think about what I said... and answer 'cause you truly believe that to be right? I agree with whatyou said. Truly. What'd I say? That a man's attitude determines, to a large extent, how his life will be. So sinceyou agree, you must be a person who does not care about the good life. How's that? Well, stop for a little second and think about it. Can you do that for me? [ Chuckles ] Okay, I'm thinkin'. No, you're not thinkin'. You're too busy bein' a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now, I wantyou to think and stop bein' a smart aleck. Can you try that for me? Look, where's this going? What doyou want me to do? There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have? One. So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy, and ifyou fixyour attitude, you can ride along with me. Okay. I wantyou to go back to work tomorrow. You were recasting the leadactress anyway. Audition many girls for the part. Whenyou see the girl that was shown to you earlier today, you will say, "This is the girl." The rest ofthe cast can stay. That's up to you. But that lead girl is not up to you. Now, you will see me one more time... Now, you will see me one more time... ifyou do good. You'll see me two more times... ifyou do bad. Good night. You're still here? I came back. I thought that's what you wanted. Nobodywants you here. Really? My parents are right upstairs. They thinkyou've left. So? Surprise. I can call them. I can call my dad. Butyou won't. Ifyou're trying to blackmail me, it's not gonna work. You're playing a dangerous game here. You know what I want. It's not that difficult. Get out! Get out before I call my dad! He trusts you. You're his best friend. This will be the end of everything. What aboutyou? What will your dad think aboutyou? Stop! Just stop it! That's whatyou said from the beginning!

[ Both Laughing ] Then I cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion, "I hateyou! I hate us both!" [ Laughing ] Such a lame scene. Butyou are really good. [ British Accent ] Thankyou, darling. Hi, there. Who areyou? Uh-- Betty? Uh, Betty, can I seeyou outside for a minute? What is it, Coco? Your aunt called. I was afraid ofthat. She wants to know who's staying in her apartment. It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad... and her plane was leaving, and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her that it was my friend Rita, and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas. Look at me straight, sweetie. Coco. She's very nice. Honey, you're a good kid. But what you're telling me is a load ofhorse puckey, even though it comes from a good place. Now, I'm gonna trustyou to sort this thing out. Thankyou. Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner said there's trouble in there. Remember last night? Well, sometimes she's wrong. But ifthere is trouble, get rid ofit. [Door opens, Closes ] Is everything all right? Is it bad foryou that I'm here? No, no. Everything is A-okay. Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich. And my audition is in one hour! [ Laughing ] I hope I'm back in a couple ofhours.
