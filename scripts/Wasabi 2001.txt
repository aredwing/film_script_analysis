She's my daughter. Daddy. My apologies... Put all that in the other room. Thank you. Very good, about the daughter. - I didn't have a choice. Still not smart, because we don't even look like eachother. Except for the nose, maybe a little. You want orange juice? - No, thank you. How about sake? Maybe later. Don't you want to try the new clothes? Should I show them? - Yeah, that's fine. Guess who went shopping. I got all your favourite stuff. You will like it. Bazooka, with heat seeker. Weighs only a pound. So I got two of them. Pressed air, mini missiles. Can destroy two city blocks, knock out an army. Very efficient. You know for sure she's your daughter? - Why? She doesn't look like you. - Momo. Except for the nose. Let's go on. Anti-personel bazooka, made in Korea. It can stop a tank. You got something I can use in town? - I have something small for that, very light. This is a classic. A 357 Magnum. The latest Uzi. And from Russia with love, you can use mustard gas with that. From Argentina, something to use from a distance, and some grenades. I'll take this one. I knew it. You don't want some grenades? No, maybe later. I have to stay discreet. I don't want to scare her. Do you know what's going on? - No I don't know much yet. The woman I love disappears just like that... and about 19 years later she's dead. She leaves me a daughter and 200 million dollars. - That's what's on the bank account. But at the rate she spends it it won't last very long. Yes and a bunch of idiots with sunglasses are following us since we left the bank. I think they want the money. - I get it. 200 million dollars. And there where it all began it shall end. I'm not in her will for nothing. I think she needed help. Someone or something must have stopped her. She left me certain clues. - Yes and 200 million dollars. Stop talking about that. It's not for you. Forget it. Would you be able to get Miko's file? Yes I think so. I know a guy for that. We will have to look into her past to understand it. I'm ready. - Ready for what? I'm going out tonight. - Not like that. It's freezing at night. You have to wear a jacket. - Yes a yellow one. I'm not going fishing. I'm going to dance. And it's always hot when I dance, just like my mother. That's right. Aren't you affraid at night? The streets are dangerous. No. A rape at every corner. - What? Not every night. - Lf I have to die, I'll do it partying. And if you are affraid, why not come with me. You can play daddy. I know you like that. Bring the grenades. Videogames in a nightclub? This is uncle Hubert and uncle Maurice. Come on everyone on the dance floor. I'm too old for that. And my knees are hurting. Come on. Do it for me please. Cross your knees. Very good for a beginner. I'm proud of you. Hey Momo, it's your turn. Everything hurts on me. Oh okay, just one time. What did he say? - He wants to challenge you... in a game where you don't use your knees. Where is it? - Over there. Ok let's go. I was winning. What's going on? I'll explain later. No, go ahead. I'll watch how you do it first. Don't panic. Don't move. If you don't mind, we will play the rematch another time. Is there another exit? - In the back. I am sure glad he's back... I'm sorry, I didn't want to ruin your evening. Who are you? - I'm not a doctor. Thanks. I found that out myself. Who are you to kill people like that? Besides, who were those men? And why did they carry guns? Do you understand? - No, but it doesn't matter. Calm down. I'll explain everything. Dry your tears. Now she reminds me of someone. Go look for Miko's file... and call the lab for the dirt under her nails. In an hour at the Hotel. - Come on I spend my life in the car. Your mother asked for me. She didn't trust anyone else. Even after all these years, I think she trusted me. She let me come here to tell me something. A secret. But someone killed her before she could tell me. Now the guys in the black suits are after you. I didn't do anything. Why do they want me? That's what I've been wondering. You told me she lived in town during the week? Two years ago she took me there. She forgot something important. We went there, but I stayed outside. She wouldn't let me inside. And when I said I wanted to see where she lived... she hit me in my face. That's the only time she ever hit me. Do you remember the address? Has she always been like this? She was pretty organized, but not like this. - Then someone has been here already. Why is all the furniture gone? - They were looking for something... but they don't know your mother. 'Never place an object in another object you can move.' What are you talking about. - You will see. I still don't get it. How did you know it was there? We had the same education. Tell me, what is this? Numbers and names. - Now it's starting to become clear. And less clear for me. My mother sent some guy to look over me... that kills everyone and makes holes in the wall. Yumi, look. Trust me. The nightmare is almost over. Alright, let's go home. This time they left the furniture behind. What were they looking for? - Probably nothing. Just intimidation. They will probably contact us soon. - What will we do? Should we leave? No, we sit down and wait. Well they didn't make any 'holles'. Holles. Holes. - Holles No, with a short L. Like in 'hold'. And then 'es', like in 'blames'. Very good. Take a deep breath. Welcome in Japan. - Thanks. My name is Kazuhiro Takanawa. It will probably mean nothing to you. - Nothing at all. I would like to meet you, Mr. Fiorentini. With pleasure. I heard you like to play golf. - I find it very relaxing. So do I. Let's play a round together. My men are waiting downstairs. - That's fine. Holes. That's better. - What's going on? I've been invited for a round of golf. - You're going to play golf now? Golfing helps with thinking. Besides, in golf you have... holes. Forget it... Could you have the room made up for us? - Right away sir. Clean out your ears. I got everything. Momo, they are waiting for us at the door. I saw it. I have the file and and all the results. Here, and don't lose it. Follow us from a distance. If there is any trouble, cover us. Oh come on. Not now. That position is totally wrong. And those legs... Like a duck. We're not at the beach. At least keep your eyes on the ball. Go play with your PlayStation. You won't lose any balls with that. You play very well, I've heard. - At least I don't miss. So good that you're dangerous. - Don't exaggerate. Give me a demonstration. Why come back to Japan after all these years. Not enough bad memories? - After a few years only the good remain. Aren't you here to make trouble? I don't know what you're talking about. - About the 200 million dollars... on your daughters account. Daddy? Bastard, dirty liar. I hate you. - Yumi, calm down. I hate you. - Calm down. I tried to tell you, but you hated your father so much. Bastard. You left us. No. Your mother disappeared, without telling anything. And no one ever told me, that you existed. If I would have known that I had such a great daughter... I would come back and looked for you everywhere. And this would have never happened. My beautiful daughter. Very touching. But before you fall into eachothers arms... I want my money back. That won't happen. The account is blocked untill she is twenty. Then we will have to wait nine hours. At 10 o'clock the bank will be open and your daughter will be twenty. Congratulations. Bring the girl away. Kill him. Slowly. Wait. This one is tough, but if you do it right... it's lethal. Don't move. French army! Damnit. Hubert, everything alright? Forget it. They are already down. You're only a few seconds too late. Oh man. - What? The grenade... - What's with it? I took the pin out. Hell of a grenade. - No, those were the grenades in the car. What did you find out? Miko left the department 19 years ago because she was pregnant. Her file is missing. At that moment the department of Defense opens a new file, top secret. I couldn't get my hands on it, however... I got pictures. Didn't you take the wrong file? These are wedding pictures. The groom is the son of one of the biggest gangsters in the north. Takanawa, the Zebra, because... - He has a scar all over his face. Do you know him? - I played golf with him. Go on. - Fifth on the left. Miko? - Amongst all the gangsters in town. She was so honest, what is this... - Wait, there is more. Miko was with the maffia. Still not two months ago she got a medal from the minister. Working undercover. She infiltrated the Yakuza to get them from the inside. But to do that she had to break up with her past. She left me to serve her country. You would have done the same in her shoes. Yes maybe. The rest is simple. She did good work, untill they discovered. So she transferred money from the Zebra to another account... and left me some clues. Be careful. That's very spicy. Still I think there is something missing. What's that? I don't know. Why didn't she say I have a daughter? I don't know. Maybe she didn't want to involve you. And when she saw she couldn't protect her anymore, you had to do it. Protect her? From herself. She knows her daughter. If I wasn't there she would spend the 200 million dollar very fast. Tell me, what's this? - Wasabi. Really good. Really, delicious. The dirt under her nails, where did it come from? Kyoto. Ofcourse. That's where I declared my love to Miko. That's where it all began and all shall end. Let's go. Hurry. We have to be back in Tokyo before 10. My dear Hubert. I sacrificed myself for my country, and I regret it. All these years I wanted to be with you, even though you weren't away. Because you never left me. You remained in my heart and you always will. Take good care of our daughter. She is great, but she spends too much money. Here is the number so you can keep an eye on her account. There should be enough money for you and our daughter. It isn't much compensation ofcourse... but I hope that our daughter will make all those bad memories go away. Because only the good memories remain, right? Yours forever, Miko. Are there still any of the old guys? There are still a few alive. - We will need them. Captain Yasumoto, please. Oh hello. Deposit or withdrawal. Withdrawal. - Cash or transfer? Transfer. It's very simple. Left the account where the money is and right where it has to go. You can handle that? Fill in... left. Lausanne... That's swiss, isn't it? - That's right. Great. - Hurry up, we don't have much time. Ofcourse sir, right away. All done. Now, how much do you want to transfer? - Everything. Both accounts? - Right, both accounts. You can buy a lot of hookers for that. Buy what? - I mean, you can have a lot of fun with that. Here. You are 20 I hope? - Yes, since this morning. Excellent. She may sign. Sign. Sign it. That's it. Finished. Congratulations, Yumi. - Enough. Now give me my receit. That's what I'm for. Talk to him for a receit. I'd think twice about that. If your friend doesn't put down his gun, you won't get out here alive. You are the one who won't get out alive. You win, Mr. Fiorentini. Very good. And to be a winner, you have to lose something. Name your prize. I don't think you can't do anything right now. The 200 million dollars are in my account. Say good bye to your 200 million dollars. Yumi, it's alright, come here. You saw what I can do with golf. Think about what I can do with a.45. Tell your men put down their weapons. It's over. Come on. Wait for me. I don't believe it. Takanawa, the Zebra? Does that ring a bell? - Ofcourse. He's inside on the floor. They wanted to rob the bank. I sorted them. When is your vacation over? Then we can clean up the country. Go ahead, it's all messed up. Mr. Fiorentini isn't in debt anymore. - That's about time. Thanks for the police escort. But we don't need protection. Well it's not for your protection. It's for everyone around you. Thanks for coming, it was nice to see you. Now it's your turn to visit. - Lf it will be as much fun, gladly. What's that? - Wasabi. You said it tasted you good, so... Maybe you'd like to try it for breakfast... - Very nice of you, thanks. Take good care of her. - You can count on me. I have to say good bye to the father I just met? First you want me dead and now I have to stay. That's how teenagers are. Crying very often and changing their mind all the time. I also have a present for you. I didn't really go shopping, but... It was your mothers. I kept it for 20 years. Now I want you to have it. One month. Don't worry, just one month. You will finish school and I will search that wallpaper for you and that's it. It will be the longest month of my life. For me too, Yumi. No problem sir. Go ahead. Have a good trip. - Thank you. French newspaper sir? Champagne? No, thank you. I'd like to relax untill I'm in Paris. No problem, sir. Attention everyone, please. Who do these belong to? Oh, no.
