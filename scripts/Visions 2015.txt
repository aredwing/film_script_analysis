EVELEIGH: There is another car. What happened to the other car? Oh, David. Oh, David. DAVID: Eveleigh, sweet. You're okay. I'm here. No, David, it's not okay. There was a baby in the other car. What happened to it? You need to tell me. Something really bad happened! DAVID: Eveleigh, it wasn't your fault. Try and go to sleep, try and go to sleep. (MUSIC) EMILIO: You gotta be careful with the potassium... DAVID: Uh-oh, there she is. She's even prettier than you said. Thank you. Like I told you, she's the reason... ...I bought that place. This place. DAVID: Hi, sweetheart. - EMILIO: Hello. I'm Emilio. - EVELEIGH: Evey. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Are you showing David the ropes? Yes, he's a fast learner. DAVID: This is like getting a master's degree in agriculture in a one-month crash course. Would you mind looking over that for me? - Sure. - Thanks. Come here. You're like a mountain man, honey. (LAUGHS) Thank you. Eveleigh's Vineyard. Are you really calling it that? You don't like it? I love it. I love it. Thank you. Well, I know it doesn't look like much right now, but in September we'll be seeing our first harvest. And you just walked past an acre of Cabernet, hillside of Pinot Gris, and then over here... Are we crazy for doing this right now, David? Come here. I don't know about you, but I'm definitely crazy. Seriously, I think this's gonna be good for you. I need you to be happy, Evey. Well, you're very needy that way. There's only one thing I want you to be thinking about... and that's having us a healthy baby. (MUSIC) (KETTLE WHISTLES) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Victor. Hors d'oeuvre? VICTOR: Oh, no, no, no. I'm going to make a toast first. Here. Thank you. I'd like to make a toast. When I first heard that there was a young couple, from Los Angeles, no less who were thinking about reopening the winery, I have to admit that my first thought was, "You have got to be kidding." (CHUCKLES) But now that I've met David and his lovely wife...? Evey. Evey. I am struck by their passion and their dedication. And these are good qualities to have because, as we all know, this valley has a bit of a reputation. It's a hard place. Crops that fail and rains that never come. But the vines that do survive are stronger because they seem to thrive on this adversity. It gives them character just like those of us who live here. Now, the wine you're drinking is a Folgore '89 and I'm not talking about 1989, that's 1889. It's one of the first wines that was made in this valley and it was made right here. I thought we'd have it tonight in honor of this young couple and to welcome them to our very special club. - Salud. - ALL: Salud! Thank you. Salud. Hey! Thank you for coming. I know it's a super long drive. EILEEN: Long? It was an eternity! But look at all the eligible bachelors you get to meet tonight. You know how much I love a man in overalls. You know, he's actually not wearing anything underneath those. (LAUGHS) Please help me suck up to these wine people. I feel like I'm doing a terrible job. You mean like that old guy who gave us the old wine? That is Victor Napoli. He's kind of like Godfather of this region, so... Very lucky he's here. EILEEN: Hey, what's going on? WOMAN: Helena Knoll! HELENA: Hi. No more wine. Unless you're Ubering it! Can't believe she came. Who is it, who is it? Helena Knoll. Top distributor in the valley. Basically, if we get our debut wine on her list, we're in. Very nice to see you. Good night. Good night. Bacon date? I beg your pardon? They're bacon dates. They're quite delicious. I know they look weird. Yeah. You must be Eveleigh. Yes. Hi. Thank you for coming, Helena. - You're welcome. - Nice to meet you. You know what? Let's go sit down. I want to get a good look at you. Okay. So, did you know the Porters? The family that lived here before. Oh, no. I know of them. They left before we... They were in way over their heads. Yeah, well, David's wanted to do this his whole life, ever since I've known him, so... Must be a very exciting time for you and your husband, what with a baby on the way. Where are your facilities? - Facilities? - Yes. The restroom, darling. Unless you want me to go au naturel. Just right back there. (GLASS SHATTERS) (HELENA MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY) Stay strong for the baby. Helena, are you okay? HELENA: It's just us mommies now. It's just us mommies now. Aaahh!! Don't touch me!!! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Of course I am. Jesus crimey. What was that? Honestly, it was like she was possessed. I've never seen anything like it. It was terrifying. Chalk it up to another mystery in the valley, I guess. - I'm serious, honey. - I am, too. If there's one person I wanted to impress tonight, it was her. Was she drunk or something? No, I don't think so. And she knew I was pregnant. I mean, How did she know that? It's not like we're Facebook friends. That is weird. I didn't tell anybody. I mean, am I showing? You want me to take a look? Oh, you'd love that. What! Okay, the claw will take the look. I made the bacon dates tonight, I've done my fair share. I'll show you bacon dates. (SCREAMS) (METAL TWISTS) What is it? Oh, it's nothing. Come here. (MUSIC) Fuckin' shit! (MUSIC) (HEART BEATING) DR. MATHISON: Looks like everything in here is going fine So exciting. DR. MATHISON: How are you feeling otherwise? Have any pain around your temples? Oh, I'm good. I mean, I'm still having nightmares and I'm still afraid to drive. But other than that I'm fine. That doesn't sound "fine" to me, Evey. Have you been in contact with your psychiatrist since you got off the meds? You may be still be suffering from lingering PTSD symptoms from the accident. I know where this is headed and I'm not going to take any meds. I'm sorry but I'm not going to do anything to hurt the baby. I understand. What about exercise? There's a prenatal yoga class here in town. I hear great things. INSTRUCTOR: Before we begin our asanas, let us welcome Eveleigh into our Prenatal Yoga Class. Let us gather around and place our hands on her manipura. Using the Breath of Fire, let us transfer love and vitality into the child. Now, close your eyes... and breathe our life chant into the child within. (ALL BREATHING THROUGH THEIR NOSES) (LAUGHS) It's not very Zen getting groped by strangers. SADIE: I burst out laughing when they did it to me. I'm Sadie. Hey. I'm Evey. Hi. How far along are you? - Three months. You? - Three. So I'm craving all these salty things, which makes me think I'm having a little boy but I don't know, there's a part of me that just knows we're having a little girl. I'm craving everything. The other night I took a chocolate bar and I just stuck it right in the middle of a bowl of ice cream. I didn't cut it up or anything. It was like planting a chocolate flag. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind completely during this pregnancy. Pregnancy is nuts! You can either let it drive you crazy or just relax and enjoy the ride. Give in to the morning sickness and the stretch marks? JUNKIE: Spare some change? Uhh... No. I'm sorry, we're all out. So sorry. Fine, then. Meth heads. Is that a problem around here? Oh, it's like a plague! I'm sorry, I just don't feel comfortable with you riding this bike. I'll be fine, Mom. All right. I'm sure you are. But there's just so many drunk drivers and meth heads. Am I gonna see you on Tuesday? Yes! Please don't leave me alone with those crazy women! You don't wanna get groped again? I will see you then, Evey. (INDISTINCT VOICE) (GASPS) (MUSIC) (CELL PHONE RINGS) (FOOTSTEPS) WORKER: Buenas. Bueno. (CAR STARTS) DAVID: What were you even doing spying on him? People come to the country to be left alone. What if they're cooking crystal meth right next door, David? How is that safe for us, or safe for the baby? Evey, you don't know what you saw, okay? Could've been anything. Where's my knife? So what, we do nothing? Yes, exactly. It's none of our business. On my way there I saw the ruins of the old house. Yeah, Emilio said he was gonna hire some guys to bulldoze it but we haven't had time. Why? No reason. Okay. (CAR PULLS UP) (FOOT FALLS) (FOOT FALLS) (BREATHING DEEPLY) David! David! (LOUD SCREAM) Oh, God! David, there's someone out there! Honey, there's someone out there. There's a man in a hood just down there. There's nobody out here. I saw someone. Okay. If he comes back I'll be on him, okay? Wait. You don't believe me? I didn't say that. No, it's... Look, it's a new house, middle of nowhere, it's creepy outside. You're expecting... We're expecting and you know... you went off those meds. That's what happens. Come on. There's nothing. Come to bed. SADIE: You are not crazy. Think of all the tweakers running around this area. It just... it felt so real. You have to listen to your intuition. And who knows? Maybe it could be your mommy sense kicking in. Oh, mommy sense. Is that like Spidey sense? Kind of. One time, when I was a baby, my sister was giving me a bath and left me in there with the water running and my mom was downstairs running the vacuum, obviously couldn't hear anything. But she just got this feeling, you know? She ran upstairs and there I was, underwater, drowning. She just knew. Mommy sense. Yeah, it's mommy sense, or it's something more than that. I was in a car accident about a year ago. They said it wasn't my fault, but there was a mother and a baby in the other car and... the baby didn't make it. I'm so sorry. That's so awful. Jesus Christ. I tried to reach out to the other family but they didn't take my calls, and I can't say I blame them. Anyway, then David put me on an antidepressant because well, I felt like I was losing my mind. Obviously, that stopped once I found out I was pregnant. Yes. Good. I'm glad. You shouldn't be putting those chemicals into your body anyway. I know. You can't keep punishing yourself over something that is not your fault. Thank you for being a friend. How 'bout I get you a chocolate mousse, huh? I'd have a cookie. David? (CAR PULLS UP) (LOUD BONKS ON DOOR) Who's there? - It's me. - (LOUD BONKS ON DOOR) Who is it? Who's there? (LOUD BONKS ON DOOR) Oh, David... (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) (LOUD BONKS ON DOOR) (GLASS SHTTERS) (DOOR OPENS) Evey? Oh, David. David. What happened? What's going on? The wine bottles just exploded! What? What're you talking about? They just... They... And there was... there was a gun over there. David, there was a goddamn gun there! (BONKS ON DOOR) - LEO: Hey, David. - Hi. Come on in. Honey, this is Leo Cottrell. He lives down the road. Hello. You know, when we talked the other day, I realized I was just way overdue to stop by and say hello. DAVID: Yeah, Leo runs a a artisanal olive oil business. - Right? - Yeah. We were talking about it and I just don't want any misunderstandings. You guys should come by and check it out. Okay. Thanks for stopping by. Appreciate it. Yeah, yeah! See you guys around. All right. I know what I saw. I know. DAVID: This isn't just seeing things. These are major hallucinations we're talking about. The hooded guy, a gun? DR. MATHISON: This is what we discussed, Eveleigh. Your pregnant body is basically a cocktail of competing hormones. I'm not taking any drugs. But you were on medication for nearly half a year after the accident and it could help you deal with your symptoms. And I felt like a zombie and I wasn't pregnant. There are very few side effects with this. You don't need to worry about that. This is a very common antidepressant. But I'm not depressed. And we don't know for sure there are zero side effects. Nobody knows. DAVID: Evey, we can't live like this. I can't live like this. I want you to promise me that if you have one more hallucination, you go back on your medication. David, we have to put the baby first now. DAVID: I'm gonna give this a minute to open up. BEN: I'm not sure I ever drank anything that needed to open up. Drunk. Whatever. We're on more of a Two Buck Chuck budget ourselves. DAVID: That's all right. So, when are you gonna get this winery up and running? We're close. The problem out here though is rain. The vines really should have shoots by now but I've been bringing in two water trucks a week since we took over. Water trucks, that sucks. Isn't this supposed to be like the worst drought in decades? SADIE: Okay, maybe don't rub it in, Ben. - Just sayin'. - It's Okay. BEN: What about you, Eveleigh? How do you like the place? DAVID: Evey. Sorry, what? She's been a little out of it recently, so... Well, imagine how out of it I'll be when I'm medicated, David. Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin the vibe. But you can't take medication, you're pregnant! Thank you. Ben, why don't I show you the winery? I think the ladies have had enough of us. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Don't wander off too far. We don't want to send a search party for you. Yes, your majesty. I'm sorry I just did that. No. Ben seems sweet. Yeah. I think he's a keeper. Sorry, I don't mean to pry, but what is this about putting you on medication? Antidepressants. No, you can't let them do that to you. Dr. Mathison says it's safe. What do you think? I think there is something wrong here, and I don't think I'm imagining it. That's your mommy sense. Right now, your protective instincts they're at an all time high so, if something happened in this house you're way more receptive to it. What do you mean? I mean-I think this house might be haunted. GLENN: Well, I'm disappointed that the house isn't living up to your expectations. That's the understatement of the year. EVEY: I'm sorry, Glenn I just need to know everything there is to know about the vineyard. Hm-mm. Yeah, I did every search I could think of. Police logs, real estate disclosures and there is nothing. No history of violence, natural disasters, agricultural accidents or any event that might be at the root of your paranormal activity. I'm actually surprised to hear you complain because most people would love to be able to say that their house was haunted by the spirits of the old wine makers-blah, blah, blah. It adds to the romance. What about the ruins, behind the house? It looked like there used to be a big old house there. Going back 80 years, nothing that I could see, no. It's been zoned for agriculture the entire time until the Porters got their building permit to convert the stable into a house. Try looking them up. That would be my recommendation. It's been a pleasure, ladies, and you let me know if I can do any more ghostbusting for you. - (WOMAN'S VOICE ECHOING) - Hello, Eveleigh. So nice to finally meet you. - (WOMAN WHIMPERS) - No! Don't! No! No! (FOOT FALLS) (WOMAN WHIMPERS) No! MAN: Why are you here? WOMAN: No! (BOOMING GUNSHOTS) (MUSIC) EVEY: Honestly, Eileen, I wish you'd been there. It was terrifying. EILEEN: Maybe it was a TV playing in a neighbor's house. Sometimes your eyes and ears can play tricks on you when you're alone for too long. Look, I just think you have to consider the most reasonable explanations first. DAVID: Sweetheart? David's home. I've gotta go. Have a wonderful time in Paris. All right. I'm gonna miss you. Take care and focus on your work. I'll see you in a few months. Oh, tell David what happened! Yeah, right. All right, fly safe. Bye, love. Hey, honey. How was today? I replaced all the posts on the north slope. I had to chase off some more of those raccoons, too. What're you up to? I just spoke to Eileen and she's off to Paris. Honey, how much do you know about the Porters? Not much, guy's in prison. Why? Don't you think it's weird that we don't know anything about the people that lived in this house before us, what might have happened here? Not really. What's going on? What if what I'm feeling is not PTSD and it's not hormonal, and it's something else. Like what? Something supernatural. I don't know. Sweetheart, let's not even go there. That's the last thing you need right now. David, what if something terrible happened back in the days of the old house? So, like what, it's a ghost that only you can see? Maybe because of my pregnancy. Maybe I'm getting I don't know, a sixth sense. Listen to me for a second. You went through something really tragic last year and that would be traumatic for anyone, sweetheart and you have nothing to feel guilty about. Okay, come here. Come on. Everything's gonna be okay. All right? - You promise? - Yeah, listen. Soon as the baby gets here, this is all gonna seem like a bad dream. Okay? (LAUGHS) (LAUGHTER) No, no. (LOUD SCREAM) What did you just do? What? Do what? Do what! God, Evey! This isn't right. If I can't make you see that, then I don't know what else to say. Evey. (SCREAMS) Evey? Sweetheart? Are you okay? What happened? No, I don't think there's gonna be a concussion but the lacerations to her face, they're not good. I understand. Yeah, I'm here with the husband right now. Yeah, we're both on the same page. Baby's gonna be just fine. I promise. (MUSIC) Morning. (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) (HEART BEATING) DR. MATHISON: Everything is great. Nothing to worry about. Due date is gonna be spot on. Sadie! - Hi! - Hi! So good to see you. And I'm so sorry that I didn't text you back. Felt stupid. I called you like a hundred times. It's not you. What's going on? Everyone said I did the right thing by taking the meds. And they're probably right. I mean, I'm not seeing things anymore, which it's a good thing, right? I don't know what to say. Well, you don't know what it was like. I felt like I was losing my mind. Yeah, but how do you feel now? I don't feel completely myself. It's an inhibitor, it stops my brain from going to extremes. When I was having visions, Dr. Mathison said my cortisone levels were through the roof. It's not his body, and it's not David's body. You know who's the one person who benefits from you taking these pills right now? It's your husband. (WOMAN LAUGHS) David? (DOOR OPENS) - Hi. - Hey. What're you doing in there? Just looking for you. Oh. I had to go down to Edna Valley and meet with a couple of big distributors down there. Oh, really? How did it go? It was good. WOMAN: Hello? Oh, hi. Is this Jane Porter? Who is this? You don't know me, it's Evey Maddox. I live in your old house in Paso Robles. Yes? Well, I-actually opened a letter addressed to you from the library. You opened my mail? Yes, I'm so sorry. I wouldn't normally do this but I saw you checked out all these books on ghosts and the supernatural and I just wondered whether it had anything to do with your experience here at the house? Oh please, Ms Porter, I know this sounds completely crazy but I've been seeing things and hearing things and, well, nobody believes me because I'm pregnant. And then Helena Knolls mentioned you. - You know Helena? - Yes. At first I thought I was losing my mind. (KETTLE WHISTES) (INDISTINCT VOICES) (GLASS SHTTERS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Come in. Helena? I'm sorry for interrupting. Eveleigh Maddox. What can I do for you? Do you remember when you came to our party, and I found you in our bedroom and you seemed... upset? I don't remember being upset. What is it? What're you here for? Are you hoping for an apology or something? No. Oh my gosh, no, no, no. I don't want an apology. I've spoken to Jane Porter. I'm seeing it, too. And I'm scared for my baby. Come here. Let me help you. Don't worry. Don't worry. I have what I'd like to I call a sensitive soul. I can see and feel a lot more than some people. Makes for a wonderful palate. When I drink wine I can feel the grapes and soil and the weather. But sometimes... sometimes it goes deeper than that. I get connected to a person or a place. It comes out of nowhere. It wraps its fingers around your heart and won't let go. Did you see something at the house? Yeah. Yeah, I did. But it was a feeling. Rage, anger, fear, it was all swirling up together. This is the place. Right here. Oh, yes. There's something here. Give me your hands. Give me your hands. You want to understand it, right? We have to connect, we have to gather our energy be open to the presence out there. They want to be seen. They want to be invited. Understand? Oohh! (SCREAMS) What was that? Something happened on this property. Something so terrible, it stained the land. I knew I wasn't going crazy. I knew it was real. Certain acts of psychic violence, the truly evil ones, echo throughout time like ripples spreading across a pond. (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) Yes. No, I am glad to hear from you. Just a minute. It's my daughter. Do you mind? I'll be a minute. No, go right ahead. (KETTLE WHISTLES) HELENA: Because I have to regain control. Helena? (SCREAMS) (HELENA MOANS) (SCREAMS) Helena? Helena! Helena, are you okay? No, no, don't talk, don't talk. I'm gonna get you help. I'm gonna get you help. I'm gonna get you help. OPERATOR: 911. What's your emergency? I have a friend who's having a heart attack! Can you please send an ambulance! Can you confirm your address, 6425 Denmar Street? Yes! It's not what you think! It's you! Oh, God! Helena! No, Helena! No! Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (INCANTATIONS IN SPANISH) What is that? WOMAN: Protection. Protection from what? A maligno. The evil one. It get much stronger since you come. Evey? What is this? It's nothing. What're you doing? Why do you have this, and what the hell is this doing in our house? Just calm down for one second, okay? Let me explain? The workers okay? Emilio's people they keep giving me this fertility cult shit, leaving it all over the place. Why wouldn't you tell me? It's just something farmers do. It's nothing. I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to fill your head with these crazy stories. I was worried that... Worried that what? That you'd start acting exactly like you are right now. Helena and I saw something in the ruins, baby, and it killed her. We saw it! No, her heart killed her. She had a pre existing heart condition. Okay. Whatever you want to think is fine. Just come with me. Let's just leave the house, please! We've sunk everything we have into this! I'm sorry. This is our dream. This is not a dream. This is a nightmare! There is something wrong in this house. I'm gonna prove it to you. Evey... No, I'm not coming back here ever again! (MUSIC) Hey, it's Sadie. Leave me a message. Oh, hey. This is Evey. You were right about everything. About the drugs, about David. I'm leaving for L.A. I just gotta do one thing first. But I'm so sorry that we fought the last time I saw you, and call me back. Okay. Bye. (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) VICTOR: I'm sorry to hear about Helena. Yeah. I didn't realize until I looked at the bottle that your family used to live on our land. Oh, yes, but that was over a hundred years ago. There's one with a good label here. Here we go. "Folgore." You can see the house clearly. It was the best estate in the valley. Did anything strange ever happen to your family when they were living there? Ehm-well, uhm... My great grandfather built the place in 1881. Family lore has it that soon after they moved in, they began experiencing these strange events- these whistling sounds and pounding on doors. Things they couldn't explain. Did they ever find out why it was happening? I don't know. You know, all this was told to me when I was a little boy by my grandmother. In any case they eventually moved out and my great-grandmother lit the place on fire. If she couldn't live there, she didn't want anybody else to live there either. You know, there's something that perhaps you would like to see. Let me go and get that. My great grandmother was a tough cookie and she wasn't gonna let go of the house easily so she hired a medium to cleanse the place. Now, the story goes... is that the medium went into a trance to try to contact the spirits that were trapped in the house. And these are some of the sketches she did. David! That's David! David, it's us. A medium saw us living in the house. DAVID: What're you talking about? I've got the drawings she made! Don't get hysterical. I'm not hysterical. I've got proof. Calm down. Honey, you have to come and meet me and get out of the house. (DEEP SIGH) But you have to come and pick me up. You have my car, all right? I'm not going back inside the house. Give me some time to pack and give Emilio instructions while we're gone. Just call me when you get here and I'll come out. I love you. (CONNECTING TONE) Pick up. Pick up! David? - David? - Yeah. Eileen? What are you...? It's okay, sweetheart. Everything's okay. What's everybody doing here? We're here 'cause we love you. David asked us to come over tonight just to help you get through this tough time. A goddamn intervention, David? DR. MATHISON: Think of it as a support system. Who's she? I saw you with her outside the cafe. This is Victoria Lambert. She's a family therapist and we asked her here tonight just because we think she can help you. VICTORIA: Hello, Eveleigh. So nice to finally meet you. Listen, I just want everything to be okay for you and the baby. Your friends want to help you regain control. Okay, shut up. We need to leave and we need to leave right now! Victoria's actually offered to let you stay at her ranch until the due date. You can just relax for the whole rest of the term. I don't want to stay at the ranch, David! We have to go! We have to go now! Just calm down. (KETTLE WHISTLES) What? Sorry. I was making some tea. It's tonight! (VICTORIA TALKS ON PHONE) I know. We should be there in about two hours. Yes, David's here. It's tonight! What's wrong, sweetheart? We were wrong, we were wrong! It's tonight! It's tonight, David! What're you talking about? David, it's happening, it's happening tonight! - We need to leave! - Okay, just calm down. Everybody, we need to leave! We have to leave now! (LOUD BONKING ON DOOR) - Don't answer the door! - Just stop! Just stop. David... We were driving to the hospital. My water broke. And I don't think I can make it to the hospital. Come on in. Ben, come on in. Come on, come on, it's okay. - No, no, no! - I'm a doctor. I'm calling the police! Give it to me! David, listen. You don't understand. There is no ghost. I was having premonitions. You're not making any sense right now, okay? Don't you see? Helena figured it out. When something truly terrible happens, it causes ripples in time, but they can go both ways! The Napolis, the Porters, they were all having premonitions of one night and it's this night, David, don't you see? We are the haunting! (FOOT FALLS) Sadie, what are you doing up? You all right? Is everything okay? Not really, no. Sadie... You should put that phone down, David. Put down the phone. It's down. Follow me back to the living room. What? Why? Come on. Come on, faster. Give me your phone. Give me your phone! Please don't do this. Sit down! Evey... - Why are you doing this? - Sit down! Haven't you figured it out by now, Evey? You're so stupid. (GUNSHOTS) (SCREAMS) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) You all right? Come on. Come on! Shit! I got her! Give me that phone! Sadie... Argh! (SCREAMS) David! David! (GROANS) - David... - Get help. - Okay. - Go! (EILEEN WHIMPERS) No! No! BEN: Why are you here? - No! No! - (GUNSHOT) (GASPS) You shouldn't have come here. Eileen. (MUSIC) (GASPS) - What's wrong? - Leo! We've gotta go! We have to go! You don't understand! - (GUNSHOT) - (SCREAMS) (GUNSHOT) (COCKS GUN) (PUNCHES) (MUSIC) (MUFFLED SCREAM) BEN: I got her. I got her. (MUFFLED SCREAMS) Sshht!! I need you to keep still for the baby. It'll be okay. You should've figured it out sooner. It was your mommy sense kicking in. But it's okay now, because she's gonna live with us and she's gonna have such a nice life. I'm gonna make it all right now. Because you you stole my baby from me! That's right, it was me. Yes, that's right. They said I couldn't have a child. They said I couldn't conceive, but I did. And he was such a beautiful little boy. He was my whole life. He was my hero. He was my little miracle baby. And then you came along and you took him from me! You did, you killed my baby! And then I went online and I saw what a perfect life you had and then I saw you were pregnant, and then I knew. I knew it was the universe putting it all back together again because I'm gonna give this child a beautiful home, and it's all gonna be okay. I need the bag now, okay? I need you to be brave for the baby. I need you to stay calm for the baby. You stay strong for the baby, okay? Don't worry. Eveleigh! No, no, no! For the baby! I need you to stay calm for the baby, okay? Give me the scalpel. Come on, come on, come on. Okay, okay, okay. Sshht. Sshhttt! (MUFFLED SCREAMS) Sadie... I don't know if I can... SADIE: It's okay.
