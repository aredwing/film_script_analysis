I'm out of toilet paper! Erez, don't sit there. - What did I do? Your brother needs toilet paper. I'll miss the episode. You've already seen it. He never takes toilet paper. For God's sake, he's your twin brother. - Kfar Saba, 1980 - My mother has always wanted me to look out for my brother, Opher. She said he was born weak and almost died. Maybe that's why she wanted me to look out for him. Thanks, slave. Every summer vacation we watched the series "The Lost Islands." Five regular kids on an island whose natives were stuck in time. "Lost Islands" My Dad didn't like the series. You're addicted. My Dad preferred to grow cacti. He used to say that cacti are like the Jews, no matter how hard you try to kill them, they survive. You can always find them on the street for free. Why should we buy Begonias? Michael Moshonov - Oshrey Cohen Orley Zilbershatz Banai Shmiel Ben Ari Some day you'll talk about the crappy car your father had and you'll say, "Our Dad was such a nut. "He drove a dented car with torn up seats." Not like the beautiful car we have today. You will tell them, and they won't believe you. Dad, we don't believe it now. Opher, you don't get rid of an old car until it dies!! What don't you understand? - Avraham, this is heavy. We won't be able to get in this year. Yes, we will. Bend your leg! - There's no room! What's the problem? Avraham, why are we stopping? We're stuck, Sima. - Oohhh... Dad, what should I tell my children now? Erez, this is no time for jokes. - I knew it. Ido, we're all going to be murdered. Duck down! Mom, Opher is scaring me! Stop it, Opher. It's probably the electricity. David, get out and fix the wires. It's not the electricity, Sima. It's the petrol, we're out. Why didn't you fill the tank? Because I don't want to die with a full tank. I want to die with an empty gas tank. There goes the Seder. This is the last time I'm going with you. Next year I'm going to Simha's parents. Go! Go to that cow of yours. If she had come with us, we'd have to tie her to the roof. Opher, shut your mouth! Dad, what are we going to do now? Sima, give me the whiskey. Come on, let's go. This is an American car, it was built using technology from the Apollo 11. It has parts from spacecrafts that flew to the moon. If you have a dream, pursue it to the end, then nothing can stop you. Nothing. Pay attention. Now, everyone push. Together! Wait. - One more. I know it's hard to believe, but that's what the '80s were like in Kfar Saba. Cars ran on whiskey and my father believed in dreams. Each of us had to have a dream. David, my eldest brother, was supposed to be an attorney. Sima, your son is crazy. He told you he wants to be a plumber? You knew about this? Sima, it's an act of treason. It'll pass in a month or two. I really want to be a plumber. - See? He fell on his head once and you didn't tell me? Did someone hypnotize you? Avraham, he's a good boy. He looks after his brothers. He supports himself. Take your brother, Avner, will be in combat units, and he's a plumber. True, his wife's a slut... Gila is not a slut. - Yes she is. Erez, make Dad some coffee. Opher's dream was to be in an elite commando unit. Why did you do that? We're going to graduate soon, Erez. If we don't write in school "Ricky Wagner is a bitch", what does that say about our generation? You know you're an idiot? Look at these heros. "Memorial wall" All the commandos broke into the school. Now they're here. Good night! - Where are you going? Erez, Erez, stop! This is my trophy. I won it. It should be in our living room, not here. I'm tired of your nonsense. - Erez! Why do you always leave just when the fun begins? I didn't win this, but it will look good in my room. Idiot! Do you think that you'll get into the elite commando unit with a police record? Do you think they need criminals like you? From now on, you must think, sleep and dream only of that. A person who has no dream is better off dead. Take this and return it to the school, right now. Dad, I won't return it. I won it. What? - I don't believe it... David, shut up. I still don't understand how you left your brother behind. What kind of brother are you? Me?! I told him to come with me. Erez, a family is like a hand. Each finger is easily broken, but if you stick together, you're invincible. Opher stole it and you're blaming me?! Erez, Mom's right. I called you and you didn't answer. That was wrong of you. Then that huge guy caught me and choked me and I couldn't breath. I don't want to talk about it. It's not funny. I always dreamed of making films. Every time a new film was shown in the theater it was like an invitation to Cinderella's ball. Our house looked like Cinderella's before the ball. My brothers and I were on cloud nine. We lived for the cinema. Simha! What's wrong with you? Did you iron my shirt? - Here it is. Thanks, Mom. - What about my shirt? I didn't have time. Can you do it yourself? I want to sit with Gila. Erez, I'll iron it for you. Can't he do it himself? Don't you know who irons best in this house? Erez, You're very independant. If you ask me, you'll be the first one to fall in love and get married. Me?! - Yes. You're like your mother. You are a one-Iove man. Listen to your father, David. You're absolutely right, Avraham. Simha, enough. You're sucking my blood. I only married Gila because her mother was sick. She came to me and said, "Avner, my mother is dying and I want her to see my wedding." And now, twenty years later, why isn't your mother dead, Gila? Listen, she heard that jogging is healthy. She's 76 years old and training to run a marathon. Don't get married. Pass me the peanuts. With a family like this, you'll never get married. I'm on a verge of a new career, I have to build my reputation. As a plumber? So, it's not good enough for you either? - No, No, No. Anything you choose is good enough. Just, choose already. I am so horny! I need a car. I'm 17.5 and I haven't done it yet. Not everyone who's fucked your mother has a car. What about the fling you had with the sheep on the class trip? Do animals count? - Of course! Hey, Watch out. I got in first! Did you see the new girl? Her name is Neta. She's mine. I called it first. - Okay. She's off limits, Erez. She'll be my wife. How do you know her name? I got the speed & good looks, you got the deep thoughts. I've already masturbated thinking about her. Can I trust you? - Of course. Because we were twins, we were always forced to share. But we had an agreement. Whoever called it first, won. Opher said he saw her first. There was nothing I could do. Neta was the daughter of Israel's ambassador to Iran. They returned to Israel just before Khomeini's revolution. She had perfume called "Poison" that no one else knew. Her shirts were from Benetton, and her jeans were Levi's. We all fell in love with her. It wasn't only me and Grandma and Opher. It was everybody. I was sure she would fall for Opher instantly. Have you talked to her? I know everything about her. Did you call her? I'll call her as soon as they get a line. The current waiting period for a line is about 12 years. Go talk to her! Spread this chocolate on her. What would I say? - Anything will do. Tell her, "You are so beautiful that you make butterflies feel awkward." You are such an idiot it's embarrassing. If we were in a plane, only your oxygen mask would drop. "You are so beautiful that you make butterflies feel awkward." Stop it. - What are you doing, you butterfly? Hi. I'm Neta. What's your name? - What? What is your name? - Boaz, my name is Boaz. But my friends call me Grandma. - Okay, Grandma. I went to an American school. I don't understand anything here. So I thought that maybe I could borrow your notebook. No problem. That's fine. I'll give it to you in the next break. - Great. Thank you, Grandma. - You're welcome, Neta. Erez, I need your notebook. Opher, I need your condoms. Because Grandma is going to fuck. Grandma, I told you she's going to be my wife. Opher, At my current level of horniness I would sleep with your sister and your wife in the same bed. I've had such a long dry spell that sometimes when I masturbate I fantasize about other times I've masturbated. Really. Look, here's Ms. Melikson. I have a hard on. Good Morning, Ms. Melikson. Grandma had been our best friend since we were seven years old. He would steal his father's porn film every Friday evening. He always made us laugh. But I always thought he was the saddest guy in the world. When I grow up I'll make movies. Porn? - Not porn, you idiot. What do you know about filmmaking? My brother will make excellent movies. He's good at bullshitting. At least I am not full of shit. What's the matter? What's going on, Dad? - You tell me. What did I do? - Did you take the tape? No, I didn't. - You're a pervert! Dad, Dad. - You're a pervert. Dad, stop it. If it's your film, why am I the pervert? You're a loser. I'm not a loser, Dad. You won't even be a street cleaner. I'll be a race car driver. I'll drive in Formula One. It's your film, so how come I'm the loser, Dad? Dad, what are you doing? Taking Layka to the same place I took your bicycle. Two years earlier, Grandma's Dad took his bicycle and threw it into the river. I saw your math notebook. It's filled with drawings of naked girls. Dad, please. Layka, Layka! Layka! That was the last time we saw Layka. You never liked walking that dog anyway. Shut up! - What? Didn't you see how his father spoke to him? Who cares what his father thinks? Next year he'll be a soldier. That dog was the only one I could count on in my family. That very day, Grandma decided to take revenge. And he did it in the best way possible. He went to his fathers stash and fulfilled his dream. He had always wanted to drive a Mercedes. Yes! Yes! All right! Hey, what do you say?! Grandma's wheels. It looks like a refrigerator. - Where did you get the money? Start it up. - Later. Come on, start it. Later. You have to push to start it. So, what do you think? Do you know that the commando can hide in an ordinary street? They can? - Yeah, sure. A commando could be standing behind that electricity box right now. Why are you going to a combat unit? Now there's a peace treaty with Egypt. Begin and Sharon will never give Sinai back. They're both nuts, just like our mother. And then we'll die before we fuck. Shame. Let's get a whore and share her and get it over with. I'm not a virgin, Grandma. - I don't go to whores, Grandma. Look what I installed. That will make her strip. I'd screw her in a second. Here she is. Look at her. She is really hot. Her father is probably trying to convince her to take some money. He's saying, "Neta, take some money, buy yourself a dress." And she replies, "I don't need money. "I need Grandma to screw me. "I want him to screw me right here. Then the father says, "No, you won't screw Grandma. "But I want Grandma to screw me." "Not on the new carpet!" - "But I want to, I must!" She can't see us. If we're in the shade and she's in the sun. The reflection hides us. How may we help a pretty girl like you? Since you're spying on me like a bunch of perverts... Just happened to pass here. - Sure. I need a ride. No problem. Enter the fridge. Thank you all. "I want Grandma." - "No, you won't sleep with Grandma." Where were you planning to go? To a movie. - To Tel Aviv. Make up your minds. Grandma wanted to screw a whore and we thought we'd watch. Really? Sounds great. Shall we go? You heard the lady. Drive! Say, are you a virgin? - What? I won't answer that question. - Why not? She doesn't want to label herself. - Nice, you're learning. Are you afraid to tell us? - No. I'm not afraid of the truth. I'm not a virgin, okay? How many boys have you been with? I don't know. The night is young. Sorry. What was it like in Iran? Better than here? How could it be better? They're all Iranians. Do you know that Iranians are... What? - We apologize. The only thing slower than Grandma's car is his brain. It was wonderful in Iran. The Americans brought Broadway Shows. What about movies? Did you see movies? Of course. I love movies. Did you see "Raging Bull"? - No, what's that? It's about a boxer who wants to kill his brother because of jealousy. No, I prefer romantic films. Boy meets girl, they fall in love and kiss in the moonlight. I like characters who always tell the truth, like in the old films. Grandma is a virgin. That's another truth. Grandma masturbates so much that a genie came out and granted him three wishes. Are you virgins? I don't want to label myself. - In other words, you're a virgin. Opher? I've been with three girls. And since, the night is young, I also included you in the count. Grandma, isn't that your mother? - No, she only works mornings. You jerk! Hello. - Hello. How's it going? Did my mother send you to see how I am? Keep moving. How much for a ride? Ask her for a discount. - Is there a discount for soldiers? Do I look like the army canteen? Do you accept checks? Go! - You faggot! If I'd wanted a dick, I would have jerked off myself! This is really not a good time to stop. Grandma, an ugly man-whore is on his way. Grandma, It's not his fault. He was born a woman in a man's body. That man is as mad as a woman. You wanted a dick, and you're gonna get one. Abandon the fridge! Riki! Riki! Riki!! Are you all right? - Yes, I'll be fine in a second. Thanks. - For what? I think you saved my life back there. You think so? That's great. I'm free to save lives on Mondays and Thursdays. What should we do? I don't know, it's late. Yes. It's cold. - Are you cold? Take this. Thank you. Do you have a girlfriend? Nope. Do you have a boyfriend? I do have someone, but he's in the U.S. He was my boyfriend in Iran. Come on, Erez. Do you miss your boyfriend? - Sometimes. Do you want to hug me? - What? Nothing. I want to, but I can't. - Why not? Because Opher saw you first so I can't make any move. You are a complete moron. - What? Did you divide me up between you? What am I, a prize? You don't have to be with him. Although he is a great guy. Really, and I'm not just saying it because he's my twin. It's 1981, not the 16th century. And if I want you... Do you want me? - You're here now. I can do whatever I want with whomever I want. That's a problem. - Why? How can you trust a girl who says something like that? I get you, Erez. - What do you get? You are a coward. I believe in absolute loyalty when it comes to family. Everyone cheats when it suits them. My parents don't cheat. I think it's inevitable. I think that in every relationship you end up hating each other. But don't worry, it won't be that way between Opher and me. Really? - Yes, because I already hate him, even before we've started. We can walk from here to Tel Aviv. - What will we do there? My father works there. We can take some money from him and take a bus home. Neta. This is our car. What's this jungle in the back? My father collects cacti. Come on. Is that your father? Erez, wait a second. He's a useless loser. Maybe it's not what you think. - Not what I think? His hand was on her breast. That's his secertary. Calm down. Let's go up. We'll get money for the bus. I don't want his money. Do you know what a good woman my mother is? You're not going to say anything to him? Erez! Erez! It's just like I said before, you're a coward. I'm sure that if Opher were here, he would behave like a real man. Why did you do that? I meant talk to him, not ruin his car. Stop it, Erez. My aunt works not far from here. Let's go get some money from her. Opher, can you stop that? - Sorry. I don't understand why Dad is so late. We should try calling him again. Why? He's been held up. Do you think he's like you, sleeping all night on the beach. Maybe that's him. Move your feet. Hi, Gila. What are you doing here? I was at work. I didn't want to call. Avraham was in a car accident. He was hurt and is in hospital. Sima, do you understand? How is he, Gila? He's in surgery. I'm so sorry. I didn't want them to notify you by phone. We have to go to the hospital. I know what I'll do. I'll make sandwiches. For the children. Opher, I'll help you with the little one. Put his shoes on. Come on. Wow, what a mess. - David, enough! That is not helpful. Calm down. Erez, get the bag from my room. Ido, stop, it's okay. Ido, come here to me. - Get his sweater. Mom, forget the sandwiches. Put them in a bag. Let's go. Erez, come on! No, no, no. No. Hello, Simha? It's David. What's up? Listen, my father was in a car accident. He's in hospital. No, you don't have to come. Don't come... But you're not my wife! Don't get all insulted. This it is not a sign that we should get married, Simha! So don't come! Listen, sit. The good news is that he will live, the bad news is that he will sit. What do you mean? He broke two vertebrae. His spine cord is broken. His legs won't work. He won't feel anything. He won't be able to walk. The artery in his back was blocked and caused a hemorrhage. Sometimes when a pipe is clogged the problem is not the clot itself. David, do you want to help the doctors free the clot with a toilet stick? So let me continue. The question is if the arm will also be paralyzed. They don't know. Opher, stop. It is all nonsense. Your father is a strong man he may have some difficulty walking, but your father will walk. When he was little he had hepatitis everyone said he would die, but he overcame it. Don't believe the doctors! I brought sandwiches. Who wants avocado? Ido, cheese or avocado? What's going on, Erez? - What? Are you okay? - Sure. Listen, I need you to help me. David is in shock, Mom... Noam and Ido are little. We've always split the mess. Say, did they say anything about what caused the accident? What difference does it make, Erez? The main thing is Dad. How are you, Gila? - Hi, Avraham. How are you, Avner? - Great, thanks. How are you? The accident was three months ago. You don't have to come every day. Look at that! I can't believe they're giving up the Sinai. Unbelievable! Begin is a traitor. Look at the way the protestors let the soldiers drag them like sacks of potatoes. Dad. - Yes, David. What would you think of me marrying Simha? - Big mistake. Are you proposing your marriage to Simha to me? Yes. It would make you happy, wouldn't it? Anything that showed me you had stopped being stupid would make me happy. Good. I'll propose tomorrow. Are you serious, David? - Yes. Call her now! - I can't call between 2:00 and 4:00. So what? Call. It's an emergency. Next year, a firstborn son! You got caught in the net. The line is dead. - No, it isn't. Hello, may I speak with Simha? Hello, Simha, It's me, David. What's up? Good. How was kindergarten today? Listen, when you come over, don't forget to bring me my bag. Okay, and Simha... I think we should get married. She said, "Yes". We'll think and set a date. No, the World Cup football tournament is this summer. He's right. - What do you mean, he's right? But the guests won't come. It makes sense. - Talk to her. So we'll get married next winter. Me, too. I can't say it because everyone is here. Simha, everyone is here... That's just the way I am! David! What are we celebrating? - David is getting married. Two summers from now. - Congratulations, David. Come on, it's only Simha... Will you stay with me tonight, Erez? Can you help me water the garden? Okay. - Great. What's the problem? - Nothing, there's a party tonight. That's fine. You can go. Can't you stay home for five minutes? I'm here all the time. But I wasn't. I fled the house whenever I could. Dad was fired a few weeks later. He was a legless 55-year-old man with no dreams, who did the one thing he used to despise most. Opher even began to water his plants for him. He wouldn't let us sell his car. He said you cannot sell a car made with parts from the Apollo 11 spacecraft. It stood there waiting for the day his legs would start working again. Hey, Opher, Erez! - Hi, man! Did you dress up as Hitler? Erez, come here one second. How are you doing? - Okay. Do you want to dance with me? - Maybe later. Maybe later I'll be busy. - Why are you so sure I want you? You have a boyfriend in the U.S., don't you? Are you a cheat now, too? Ever since my father was injured I've had to be tough. I've had to carry everyone through. You know what's lucky, though? That my parents love each other. They don't lie to each other. Don't you think your father could cheat on your mother? Any man would cheat on his wife if my father was on a desert island and a spacecraft landed, bringing a great looking alien, he would have to sleep with her. A woman would refuse, and an intergalactic war would begin. Have you ever thought about that? About what, sleeping with an alien? That maybe your parents cheat. If they did, they wouldn't miss the chance to tell each other about it. Do you know what I just realized? She's crazy about me. She's doing all of this just to make me jealous. Neta, from the first moment I saw you I haven't stopped thinking about you. I eat, drink, walk, sleep, jump, skip Neta. You are so beautiful that you make butterflies feel awkward. Really? - Yes. They're kissing. They're kissing. I'm going to masturbate thinking about her tonight. Grandma, let's go. - What? Just when it's getting interesting? Did you hear something? - What? I don't see anything. And I have perfect night vision. Erez! Erez! Listen, I think you should leave. - What? Why? I have a boyfriend. - Where? - In the U.S. That's on the other side of the globe. He's probably asleep. If you really want to know, I don't care. But I think he would. You can be his in America and mine here in Israel. He'll have a problem with that. I'll also give him China and the USSR. You know what? I don't mind cheating but I won't have sex with you. Okay? Okay. - Aren't you sorry? Sorry? I'm glad we're not sleeping together. I have a dog named Dingo, I'll sleep with him. He's very free with his body. No matter, I'll stay a virgin for another day. You're a virgin? You never did it? Not really... Once I dreamt that I slept with Nili Segal so I counted her. I've never been with a virgin. Is that a problem for your resume? No one ever forgets his first time. Except for Alzheimer patients. Will you shut up? - Okay. Do you want to do it or not? - I do, I do. How does it feel the first time? - Very nice. It's the best feeling in the world. - I know. I'm going to the tattoo guy in Tel Aviv and make a picture of your brother on my ass. It was incredible, incredible! The way he softened her up! Poor Erez is falling apart, because his father is sick, and... Shut your mouth, Grandma! Shut up!! Relax, I was just kidding. Screw you! You're taking the costume too seriously. Three months later... What's wrong with you? What? Nothing. - Keep eating. What about you, Erez? - What? When will you find a woman who'll iron your clothes? Mom won't do it forever. Mom never did it. You always ironed my clothes. I've been watching you recently, and you never look me in the eye. Why do you say that? This is not anybody's fault. It's just life. I was in an accident. You must learn to accept that. Mom, Dad, I have to tell you something. I got a girl pregnant. - Simha? No, not Simha. - Then who? What difference does it make? You got a girl pregnant and it doesn't matter who she is? Dad, what do you say? That I'm tired and going to bed. Dad, I need your help. Should I go back in time, get your "thing" out of her "thing" and tell you, you're knocking someone up? Dad, what should I do? Have an abortion. - I don't think I can. So, who did you get pregnant? Michal Mizrahi. Our neighbor? She's 17. - She turned 18 two weeks ago. How did this happen? Mom, David is a plumber. He's used to sticking his pipe into holes. - Stop it, Opher. How was she? - She's 10! I think I'm in love with her. I want to marry her, Dad. Don't even think about it. - Why? You promised Simha you would marry her! Promised? They're just dating. We were at her parents' house, we shook hands. If he promised, how did he get Michal Mizrahi pregnant? I can't just throw Michal to the dogs. Her father has a gun. He once shot a thief. Avraham, the boy is in danger. Come here, come here. You will not be a shit, do you hear me? You will have the abortion and do the right thing. You're not going to stand up that girl! Avraham leave the boy alone. But David was stubborn. And in truth, we all thought that Michal Mizrahi was much prettier. Where is your mother? She's bringing my father. They'll be here in a minute. Where is Dad? - He's not coming. What do you mean, not coming? Say that he doesn't feel well. Don't say that he and David argued. Mom, I'll go up and to talk to him. It won't do any good, Opher. He doesn't understand There are times you just close your eyes so things will be OK. Let's go, we're late. Mom, Why are you rushing? We have all the food. They should be coming to us. With this ring I thee wed. Great! Mazal Tov! - Congratulations! Opher, play the song we talked about. Follow me. Guys, I figured out what I'm going to do in the army. I'll be a driver. I'll drive a car for three years. It will be "cool". Cool? It's a new word. Grandma thinks he invented it. It won't catch on. - Yes it will. I think I'll try to join a combat unit. What? Yes. I'll try to become a paratrooper. Congratulations, Erez. Why congratulations? You're a wreck. You'll be the first soldier to suffer from shell shock before you leave base. - I can work out. You were born an old man, Erez. You have osteoporosis. You should be somewhere where they write. I want to get away, to leave home. Are you stupid? You'll die there. What do you care, Opher? It annoys me that everyone thinks they can be in an elite unit. Does anyone want a soda? Listen, you'll be able to screw any girl you want. It will be... cool. That word "cool" won't catch on. No one believed in groovy either... I'm going to dance. Cool. I haven't told you anything, but I think about it all the time. I don't think it was your fault. What? Your father's accident. It doesn't make sense that a flat tire would cause something like that. Have you talked to Opher about this? - Of course not! Have you told anyone? No. It's not your fault, Erez! - Okay, if you say so. It is not your fault! I punctured his tire. - It was a coincidence. Ask him. You've been eating yourself up for nearly a year and you've never even asked him? Maybe he changed the tire. You don't know. Erez, flat tires don't cause accidents, believe me. Ask him, please? You promise? Avraham, what happened? What happened to you? I tried to go to the bathroom. I told you we'd be back in four hours. I couldn't just leave. Let's take you to the bathroom. It doesn't matter any more. Then let's take you to the shower. Go make me some coffee. - I'll take you to the shower first. I asked for coffee. I'll take you, Dad. - Give me a moment. Dad... I'm all right. Don't mind me. A son shouldn't have to wash his father's ass. Who said that, Aristotle? Nietzsche? Don't give up your dreams for me, Opher. What's a dream? You dream a new one every night. You make a big deal out of dreams. "The IDF spokesperson announced "that Israeli Air Force planes attacked the nuclear plant in Iraq. "The pilots reported that the plant was destroyed." -Yes!! They blew up the nuclear plant in Iraq. That Begin is a genius, Two years from now no one will know who Shimon Peres is. Opher, soon you'll be like those pilots. Mommy's officer. I decided not to go, Mom. What? I'll stay close to home. I'll serve in a non-fighting unit. What is this nonsense? Don't tell Dad. But Opher, that was your dream. I wanted to be the commander of the IDF, but I found out he doesn't get car allowence. - But you exercised so much! Dad weighs over 100 kilos. So I didn't exercise for nothing. But you should stop feeding him. No more cookies, Mom. Besides, Erez is going. He called it first. Be strong, be strong. There are rocks here, careful. What happened, cutey, does your stomach hurt? Do you want some coke? Finish and come on! Hello? Neta. - Erez. How are you? - Are you all right? How was Opher's induction? Fine. Grandma was able to get away from his course to come as well. We missed you. Was my father there? No. But Opher will be coming home every day. He's having a ball, your brother. There're lots of girls in his base. If they catch me talking to you I won't be home until I am 65. Wait! Why do you have to stay there for the weekend? It's a punishment. I crossed a firing line. What? That's very dangerous, Erez. I don't care, Neta. You're insane. - I don't care. Don't tell Opher, okay? Don't worry. I'll never tell your secrets. Be strong, Erez, do you hear me? Erez, will you let me shoot people in the street? Actually we're supposed to shoot people over the weekend. Look at this. I like your short haircut. What? He looks stupid. So, tell me what goes on there. I got a thorn this long stuck in my dick. Ouch! Well, you won't be home for the next three years anyway, so it won't matter. Opher, I want to speak with Erez. - Okay. What is this charade of you serving in a combat unit? You always said it was important to serve my country. Why did you to Opher? - What did I do to Opher? Why don't you help at home? What do you want from me? - You make your brother a slave. I earned 13,000 lira. Take your money. I don't need money. I need help in the house. But I'm on your side, Mom. There is only one side, the side of the family. Where are you? I'm here. - You're not here. Your Opher will be in an urban base, he'll be safe. Does that make you happy? Don't you dare speak to me that way. You are evil. I cared for all of you. Don't you dare say that I love Opher more. You are my punishment. Here, slave. David, gotten anyone pregnant since yesterday? Dad, I understand your anger. - I am not angry. Let me speak. I prepared a speech. - But I am not angry. Great, then come to the circumcision. I relinquish that honor. I want you to be my son's godfather. What should I name him? Hole-in-the-condom? David, I sincerely congratulate you and I wish that your son will do to you just what you did to me. Dad, how much time do you have left? Mom says that you're deteriorating, if you don't see your grandson today... Why are you crying? Stop crying. Stop crying. Please stop crying. Stop it. Enough. I'm going to sleep. I need to talk to you. To me? Yes, I'm not speaking with him. What happened? - Didn't Opher tell you? No. He didn't say anything? No, he didn't. What happened? If you knew, you would know. Are you smoking? I already have one screwed up father. Stop patronizing me. - I'm not being patronizing. Stop judging people, Erez. You've made your mistakes, just like everyone else. I only pointed out that you're smoking, that's all. Your brother is cheating on me. No way. He has some slut named Emily. Can you believe that name? It must be a mistake. He admitted everything. He wants to be with her. I'm sorry. It can happen to any couple. I thought he and I were different. I thought we were creating new rules for love. Your brother is a stupid idiot. So what, if he has a witty answer for everything? That doesn't make one smart. Erez, what are you doing right now? - I don't know. Do you want to go to the beach? We can swim in the nude, I'll show you my underwear, you can show me yours. I can't do that to Opher. He takes care of my father. How would it look if I was with you while he takes care of my father? I'm not going to wait until your father dies. What happened, Dad? - They shot Argov. Zohar Argov the singer? - No, Shlomo Argov our ambassador in London. Those Arabs are murderous people. We gave them all of Sinai and what did we get in return? Murder and more murder. You got a call from the army. You have to go back. Don't worry, Mom. It's probably just a drill. There must be a war. We must react. Then they'll understand that they cannot target Jews. That's how the Holocaust began. Erez, look after yourself, okay? Crawl into the cacti. - What? If they shoot at you, crawl into the cacti. Who would think that someone would crawl in there? Erez, I packed your bag. Now go take a shower. Remember, cacti. What are you doing? Didn't they teach you to knock in basic training? Did you leave Neta? - What does it look like? Is that the right thing to do? People always think others should do the right thing. I'm leaving. - No, you're staying. Erez, go away. - Does she know you have a girlfriend? Do you think I would lie to my mistress? He who lies to his wife is a cheat. He who lies to his mistress is a real scoundrel. Why did you leave Neta? Do you get the feeling that I owe you something? That girl was your dream. - No, no, no. My dream was to be in the elite commando unit. Let me remind you that someone stole my dream from me. The only person I ever trusted. You're not missing a thing. It's shitty there. It's shitty, is it? I clean up shit. I clean up your father's shit. I clean up the shit you haven't got the courage to clean yourself. You lift a machine gun. I lift your father. When he dies, they'll call you for his funeral, but I'll be here to wash him before the undertaker arrives. I'll be here to support Mom. Where will you be? Where? Where? You'll be out fulfilling my dream, right? So, don't walk into my room without knocking. Because it's no longer your room. Get out of here! Nabatia, Lebanon 1982 Lansky, don't touch that man! What has he done to you? Here is Erez. Erez, I don't believe it! What are you doing here? Erez, this is my friend, Amir. He just returned from India. Hello to you, Sir. He lived in Goa for six months. - What's Goa? It's a place in India. There are no Israelis there. Tell him you have to come with me. Hey man, take it easy. Give me a minute, okay? What? You have to come with to be with Opher. You come by after months and jump all over me. Why do you think I should be with Opher? Because he made a mistake. People make mistakes and they shouldn't have to pay their whole lives. He thinks about you. He can't live without you. And I... - Yes, what about you? Neta, come on! Get out of here you pile of smelly curry. Take things easy, man. Do you want to be part of my family? Eat Friday night meals with us? Neta. Come with me. Wait for me here, okay? Neta. How nice to wake up and see you here. How are you? Why the sad face? Your children. - What about my children? I love both of them, Avraham, but they are ruining my life. Do you love Neta? - Hmm, yes. So why did you cheat on her? Is that what you came to ask? Okay, Erez. Like most people, I'm opposed to cheating, except when it is mine. She has someone else. What about Erez? Does he talk to you? Because here at home he keeps everything to himself. Your child is suffering. - Suffering? Why is he suffering? Did he tell you what the problem is? He feels... - What does he feel? Neta, what does he feel? If you don't go back to her now, you'll lose her. Do you want to give her up? Because if you do, she is here in the living room. - What? So go tell her that she is free. No, Neta is not a girl that you give up. We were in Tel Aviv on the day of your accident. We came to visit you. - You came to visit me? When? I didn't see you. - We... Erez accidentally punctured your tire. The burden that he's carrying is too much. He punctured my tire? Erez punctured my tire? What do you mean, accidentally? You'll help him, right? - How can I help him? What can I say? Erez, try not to puncture my tire next time? Is that what I should say? Is it? Tell her already. - What do you want me to say? Tell her that you're an idiot, that you love her. That you were meant to be together, that she's not a girl you cheat on. And that Emily is just a pair of breasts. That could work. - Okay. I'm sorry, you are not a girl to cheat on, I'm a moron... and Emily has great breasts. Emily has... Erez's version was better than yours. Because he's a writer. You are the best friends I will ever have. We can make it a threesome. Strip! Now you tell Erez. Erez, you have great breasts. - Not that, jerk. Tell him that he doesn't have to take care of you all the time. But he does. He's my twin brother. We take care of each other. That's how it works. Good night to you both. I'm off to conquer Lebanon tomorrow. This is not a training exercise, guys, this is the real thing. I love you and trust you. I know that each of you carries with him his love of country and his love for this unit and we will go into Lebanon and hit the PLO hard! We will screw them! - Yeah! Yeah! Ido, go see who's at the door. Hello. Is this the Levy residence? Yes. - Is your mother or father home? Yes. Sima and Avraham? - Yes. My name is Moti, I am the local IDF representative. I'm afraid I have some bad news. It's Erez, in Lebanon? Your son is called Erez? - Yes. Do you have a son named Opher? - Yes. I am very sorry. Opher drove to Lebanon this morning, the building he was in collapsed. How did he get to Lebanon? There was intelligence material that had to be delivered there. Your son volunteered. No one else wanted to go and Opher insisted on making the journey. Your son is a hero. I am sorry. Opher is dead. You have four living children to care for. I don't care. I don't care. I would have preferred for one of the others to be taken. I wanted him to live. He was my prince. My baby. None of them touched my heart the way he did. Do you think I'm a bad woman? If you ever say what you just said again, I'll leave you. I'll take myself and leave. Once, when you used to say you would leave me, that frightened me more than anything else. Now, I don't care. My condolences. - Thank you. Airplane, airplane. Go to Mama. What are you doing these days, Grandma? I left home and am living with a girl in the city. Are you still training with your car? If you want to be a race car driver, don't postpone it. I'm going to get a cab driver's license. Driving a cab is enough for me. The main thing is to be away from home. If that's what you want, that's what you want. I'll see you tomorrow. I want to tell you something. I'm going to India with Amir. He invited me to travel with him. What do you think? I don't know. Is he's nice? Not as nice as you, but he's okay. He says that it is an amazing place. When are you leaving? I don't know. This place gets worse and worse. It was the same way in Iran. Everything became black. It's not good, Erez. Why don't you come with me? Leave the army, get discharged, leave the madness behind. I have to take care of my father. I love you. Bye. Erez, come here. I want you to tell Neta not to come here anymore. Why should I tell her that? Because I can't stand seeing her. Some day she will have another guy, she's easy. She won't be alone for long. To me, she will always be Opher's. Once she has someone else, I'll know that Opher is dead. That he isn't coming back, that everything is over. Okay. Erez. I'm sorry. Erez. What are you doing? I'm cleaning my gun. Come help me with the cacti. Go catch Neta before she leaves. She belongs to Opher, Dad. Opher? Opher is dead. He has nothing. Look, I've made many mistakes, but I have never been wrong when doing something for love. Sometimes, remaining loyal to your wife, or to your dead brother, means betraying yourself. Mom will go crazy. - Let her go crazy! If she had listened to her mother you wouldn't have even been born? Do you know who is the smartest brother in this house? David. - David? Because he knows when to cheat and when to be loyal. He puts himself first. Look at this cactus. It will do anything to survive. In the toughest desert. Erez, you must learn to survive. Do you understand? Do you want a coffee, Avraham? - No thanks, Sima. Erez, do you want coffee? No. Life can change in an second. Look at me. I was a regular man, I wanted to build the largest building in the middle east. One accident, one second. There was an oil stain on the road. I didn't notice it and I skidded. Oil on the road? - Oil. It was a unfortunate day. I had to change a flat tire beforehand as well. Now go, do you hear me? Wait a minute. Take my Chevrolet. It should be moved once in a while. Why did you lie to the boy? Why did you tell him there was oil on the road? Sima, family is like a hand. Each one is a finger and I am the thumb that protects them all. Never tell him otherwise. Do you hear me? Never, Sima. In the time that has passed since then, I've been happy and I've been sad. I've been right and I have made terrible mistakes. But I've never felt as free as I felt there, in my mother's living room with five children who were stuck in time and watched "The Lost Islands" every summer. Dedicated to my family who taught me how to love.
