Lock us down. Heat signatures everywhere. They've covered all the halls. Then I guess we better clear the halls. Go! Evacuate! Now! Come on. I dare you to come walking through that door. Come get some. Keys. - Who the hell did we piss off this time? - Get in. - This thing armed? - Always. Good man. You ever seen one of these? Only in my dreams. Geothermal micro cam, Aquacade uplinks, 480 gigs. Sir, this thing is 10 generations beyond the NSA. So whoever attacked us is loaded for war. And they knew exactly where to hit us. We gotta go off the grid now. Not another skater, snowboarder or biker. The new XXX has gotta be more dangerous. Deadlier. More attitude. More attitude? Where the hell are we gonna find that? You have a meeting with the EPA at noon... ...to discuss... - A tree is a tree. How many more can they look at? Your anniversary, roses or tulips? George. Tulips, yellow. Thank you. An NSA chapter was just hit. Sixteen agents, all dead. Sixteen of our men? On our own soil? How the hell did this happen? I'm looking into it. - Suspects? - Too many. How concerned do I need to be? I'll take care of it. Quick and clean. And contained. Goddamn it, 16 men? How many more have to die? This is no longer a budget meeting. The secretary of defence has just informed me... ...that 16 of our NSA agents were killed. In Virginia. This is a laundry list of suspects that covers half the world. It's time for a new direction. The new military bill is critical to that direction. So it's going in my State of the Union address this week. Some privacy, please. Attorney-client privilege. Good to see you again, lieutenant. How long has it been? Nine years? Not long enough. And don't call me "lieutenant." I'm inmate 3655 now. What you doing here, Gibbons? What you want? You. I wanna give you a job. And why would I do a damn thing for you? You ever see lions at the zoo? You can always tell the ones that were captured in the wild... By the look in their eyes. Jesus Christ. You still coming with that same sorry-ass speech? Does it ever actually work? - From time to time, yeah. - Not this time. I'm not feeling too patriotic these days. So I want no part of your little war. You're already part of it. Somebody's taken out members of our old unit. They came for me. They will come for you. Now, you can die in here, or you can take the fight to them. The Darius I remember always liked to throw the first punch. New speech, huh? You get any exercise in here? Twelve to 1 every day on the yard. - Bravo Delta High Sign. - High Sign? High Sign. Be just like old times. You better hope not. Because last time out didn't have such a happy ending. You went MIA, and I ended up in here. Okay, wrap it up. Hey. I like what you did with your face. Come on, let's go. There's been a report from home office. Xander Cage was killed in Bora Bora last night. Bora Bora? Why don't I get those assignments, huh? What about Gibbons? Any word on Gibbons? Unaccounted for. We do know this: He was one of only three men with access to that elevator. The other two... Ain't gonna be giving us much of a statement. All right, put Mr. Gibbons on the wire. Full recon. Wrap it tight. A- Block to exercise yard. A- Block to exercise yard. Time to take the dog out for a walk. You know... ...l'm gonna really miss you boys. - What? - Secure all doors! - Prisoner, stand down! - Level six, lockdown! - Get backup up here! Prisoner, stand down! Get him! - Laundry! West door! - Marco! Got him. Two hundred and fifty yards. Where's he gonna go? He's nowhere near the wall. All right, man! - Get him! - Hold it! Come back! You were late. You sure know how to pick them, sir. Who the hell is this guy? Civilian contractor. By the time he wakes up, we'll be long gone. - You said 12:06. - Hit some turbulence. - We got large and extra large. - Who are you, the butler? Toby Lee Shavers, D.C. Tech Division. - Yeah. Darius Stone, cellblock A. - Not anymore. Darius Stone no longer exists. - Well, who the hell am I? - You're the new XXX. Sound like a porno star. - What happened to the old XXX? - He's dead. XXX is the designation we give to deep-cover agents with special skills. Yeah, whatever. First things first. I've been on the inside a long time. I need what every man needs when he's coming off of lockdown. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, baby. Who's your daddy? You sure we got the right guy? Hey, buddy, more fries and another shake. You got it. - We need to go to work now. - I need more fries and another shake. Hey, you work for us now. - So you're gonna do... - What I want when I want. Look... ...by my count, you boys just broke about 10 federal laws back there. Aiding and abetting, harbouring a fugitive... ...and my personal favourite, grand-theft chopper. - So, what's your point? - That you two... ...are looking at three strikes and the inside of a very small cell. - You know that's my speech. - I'm running the show now. So here's the deal: I don't answer to you... ...and I damn sure don't answer to college boy. College boy? Done. Pay the man. Okay. So we know you can fight and eat, but what else can you do? The last XXX, he could ski, surf, do all kinds of stunts. Well, he's dead now, isn't he? So things are gonna be different around here. Because I don't play with my life. - I'd rather play with yours. - We gotta get back to D.C. We need a place to lay low. I know the safest place in town. This is the safest place in town? Stay put. I'll handle this. D-Train Stone. Heard they had you locked down in the deepest hole... ...this side of the Grand Canyon. Yeah, they let me out early for bad behaviour. - Man, it's been a while, D. - Where's the boss? I need to talk. Man, a lot's been changing since you left, D. I run the chop shop now. - Where's Lo? - Uptown. Uptown? Now, this is more like it. Welcome to the west side, X. You wanna run in these circles, you're gonna have to blend. I don't blend. The Dino has the torque curve dropping off around 6400 rpm. Dial down the injector pulse width by about 10 percent. Try 20. Darius. You look older. Nine years of bad food will do that to you. Nine years. Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that a few years shy of 20? Just tell me what you need so we can do this and be done. That is why you're here, right? You need something. Hot shower, place to crash. Look around, Darius. I've got a good life here. And I'm not gonna let you wreck it this time. So... ...what's in it for me? '67 GTO. Thousand horsepower, crate motor, trick suspension. - What? - He's right. - They'll be looking for it. - Besides, if we're gonna roll... ...we're gonna need something with a little more muscle. Something nasty. I can do nasty. I know you can. Bored and stroked, full roller, 8 litres. Supercharged with a 25-psi boost, automated hydraulics... ...high-stall converter with shift kit. That gonna do the trick? - You happy? - I'm good. I love this girl. All right, the target is information. It's on a hard drive inside my old headquarters, here. The rest of it is at my house. - I'll pick that up tonight while... - Information? Well, start by giving me some. - We on the same page? - You know what I'm talking about. Last time out, I went down, and you disappeared. Look, you aren't the only one who lost something that day. When the fire started, you were busy with the general. Some of us went in to see who we could save. Now, you think this looks bad? You should've seen it before I got it fixed. Guess nobody's story has a happy ending. Story's not over yet, soldier. Shavers... ...can you make that into a personal weapon? Give me an hour. - We straight? - It's funny, captain. Wars come and go, but my soldiers stay eternal. I like that. Who said it? - Jefferson? Patton? - Tupac. All right, X, this is a covert op. Full stealth, total silence. You're gonna wanna be real delicate here. Subtle. Very subtle. This is sector 14. We got an attack, topside. You two, hold the floor. Everybody else, follow me. All right, X, you got three minutes. X, Gibbons' office is northwest corner, sector four. Hey! Wait! X, main room. Remove the first of three drives facing you. There's nobody here. Yeah, except for all of us. It wasn't an attack, it was a diversion. All right, X, they're coming back down. You gotta go. Now. Lock this place down. I want him in hand, alive. College boy, I'm cut off. Get me out of here. Okay, X. Boat dock, quarter mile, dead ahead. I want that truck. Block every road in a 10-mile radius. Everybody okay? Blows up my car, he blows up my boats. Who the hell is this guy? All right, college boy, I'm headed upstream. X, got a little bit of a problem here. This is the police. Goddamn! All you had to do was drive. You know what, X? I'm really starting to miss the old XXX. Stop your vehicle now. Okay, I see you. Hey, get your ass out the driver's seat. Mission accomplished. Darius Stone. Born south side, D.C. Mother died young, father raised him. Not much to report till '88. His dad was killed by a stray bullet in a 211, and Darius went off the grid. Started with graffiti, reckless driving. Quickly worked his way up to grand-theft auto and resisting arrest. Took him some time to find his calling in the Navy. Specifically, the Navy SEALs. Trained sniper, top scores. Urban recon, demolition. The highest dive in Navy history, Augustus Gibbons recruited him into an elite unit, Level 5 Classified. Ran ops in Eastern Europe till Christmas in Kosovo. Their general ordered them to set a fire to clear civilians, but Stone refused. Led a mutiny against a four-star general... ...the current secretary of defence, George Deckert... ...who had him court-martialed for a 20-year term. Ten for disobeying direct orders... ...and another 10 for breaking the general's jaw. This is the last footage we have on him. A meeting with his lawyer, Jonathan Edward Cochran. Oh, that's cute. Johnnie Cochran. I don't think Mr. Stone can afford Johnnie's fee. Do we have audio? It's attorney-client. No mikes. Hold it there. Okay, reel it back. Back, back, back. Freeze it. Blow it up. Gibbons and Stone on a comeback tour. All right, listen up. I want all eyes up and running on these two. And I want hard 20s on the rest of their old unit. I wanna know where they are... ...I wanna know what they're doing, and I wanna know now. I'm disappointed, Auggie. Checkmate in three? You should've seen it coming. Relax. Have a drink. - I took the liberty of pouring myself... - You were always taking liberties. Same old Gibbons. Good soldier with a bad attitude. You know, I always remember the first day we met. I remember the last day I saw you. I bet you do. Didn't heal too well, did it? Some wounds never do. - I never asked you to go into that fire. - You just set it and watched it burn. We did what needed to be done. That what you call it? "Doing what you need to do"? Sixteen of my men killed? What's that, just more friendly fire? Some men die so others may live. Funny... ...that you never seem to be the one doing any of the dying. I'll do whatever it takes to best protect this nation. You're not protecting the nation. You're doing this to protect yourself. - Why? What fires you starting now? - We both live in the same world. - We know what's out there. - Save the speech. Just so you know... ...whatever you're up to, you're not getting away with it. Why? Because Darius Stone is gonna stop me? I'm sorry. Was that supposed to be a surprise? Gibbons, I know every move you make even before you do. You still work for me, whether you know it or not. I never worked for you. - I work for my country. - I don't know what's more pathetic... ...a man that plays chess with himself... ...or a man that doesn't see he's already lost. Make it look like an accident. Zero exposure. Sir, they found Gibbons. Investigators say an apparent gas leak triggered the explosion. The fire department was too late to save the occupant... ... but managed to contain the fire before it spread. The deceased, Augustus Gibbons, was a former Navy captain. He was 51 years old. The funeral's tomorrow at Arlington National Cemetery. Gas leak. Right. This is Lisa Joyner reporting from Chevy Chase, Maryland for WJLA. Back to you in the studio. Toby, let's get to work. There's nothing on here. Nothing. It's blank, man. Because you're looking in the wrong place. Gibbons said it was on the hard drive. What are you doing? I read about that. Cold War. Old school, right? Not that old school. All right. Now, which one's Charlie? Only one way to find out. Ready. Aim. Fire. Ready. Aim. Fire. Order arms. Like our Lord and saviour... ...Augustus Eugene Gibbons died in our service. Head of the NSA, FBI, Joint Chiefs, secretary of state. Damn. You know what this means, right? - What? - They're gonna kill me next. - Give me those. - Damn, man. If we're working together, you should work on your partner skills. Like, if you want something, try "Please," "May I borrow...?" Please, may I borrow the binoculars... ...before I kick your teeth in? Okay. See, now, that's a start. Not bad. - Deckert? - You know Secretary Deckert? Oh, yeah. We go way back. But he hated everything about Gibbons. So, what is he doing here? - Charlie. - You found him. Her. - Her? - Can you get me a suit? Oh, so now you wanna blend. I hear this place has the best gumbo in town. Excuse me. I'm actually meeting someone for lunch. Relax, Charlie. This'll only take a minute. How did you know my name? Who are you? We have a mutual friend. Augustus Gibbons. Had a mutual friend. And you didn't answer my question. Who are you? My name is Darius Stone. Stone? You have half the suits in this city looking for you. Why come here? Trust me... ...they won't look for a guy like me in a place like this. Well, no offence, but I don't trust anybody right now. Good. That means we got something in common. Charlie. I'm sorry I'm so late. I had that urban-youth meeting. It ran over. We're trying to set up that after-school... ...gun-instructional program for kids and... I'm sorry. Dickie Ambrose, NRA. Hi. Reverend Billy Bob Baker, Southern Baptist Brotherhood. Well, it's just great to meet you, Reverend. Hey, listen, we're setting up this rally upstate next week... ...and I was just wondering if there was some way we could attract... ...you know, some upstanding African-Americans like yourself. You got any advice for us? Well, Dick, perhaps you could tell your members... ...to stop buying country music, stop burning crosses... ...and stop shooting black folks. Hear me? Now, if that don't work... ...try a cookout with free food. Preferably fried. Dick... ...would you mind terribly if we rescheduled? I think that would be... Yeah, that's fine. I have a lot of stuff to do. - Reverend, I'll... - Call me. I'll call you about that. Tell me about you and the captain. I was Gibbons' contact on the Hill. I'm an aide to the Senate Subcommittee on Military Action. Military? Deckert. Secretary of Defence Deckert? There's not a bullet shot in the dark that he don't know about. So tell me something, Charlie. Can you get me close to him? Well, Reverend... ...you think you can lay your hands on a tuxedo? You made it. You know, I never miss a party. Not quite the tux I had in mind. Yes, but I'm blending. You see the guest of honour? Those bodyguards? SEAL Team Four. Half my old unit. And not the better half. Who's the ugly general he's talking to? Jack Pettibone. Vice chair, Joint Chiefs. - Doesn't look too happy. - Must be the music. One way to find out. I truly can't believe what I'm hearing. We go back 30 years, Jack. Same blood in the same mud, and you never questioned my command. I presume you've heard of the United States Congress. Jack... ...this country is being led down the wrong path. You really think you can do this, don't you? With just a few regiments. Once we lead, the full force will follow. The clock is ticking. With or without you. Three days. He's here. Black guy, white tux. Had enough of the party? Hold on. You asked me to track down the rest of their old troop? Well, half of them are still enlisted. - What about the other half? - Gone. Missing. The same men that backed Stone against Deckert. Every single one of them just disappeared. Wait a minute. This is your home? Not bad for a senator's aide. I'm not just a senator's aide. I'm also a senator's daughter. James Mayweather, Virginia. Think Daddy's ready to meet a guy like me? - Actually, Daddy's out of town. - Really? Make yourself at home, Darius. Not a bad place to grow up, I guess. Only on the surface. Growing up in D.C. Politics is like living in a snake pit. Everybody fighting for territory. Sounds a lot like where I grew up. Oh, no. This is nothing like where I grew up. Let's get you out of those clothes, shall we? Here we go. Why don't you try these on. Not really my style. Why don't you go ahead and get cleaned up. There's some fresh towels in the bathroom. Full-service, huh? You know, if you need anything... ...l'm just right down the hall. Anything? Anything at all. How about some fries and a shake? The things I can't do for my country. Charlie? Charlie. Pettibone? She set me up. Bitch. This is the police. Come out with your hands behind your head. We got the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs in there. The assailant is armed and dangerous. Proceed with extreme caution, gentlemen. Gus, get me a hostage negotiator, clear a two-block radius... ...and five is the active perimeter. - Better make that 10. Captain, the man's a Special Forces sniper. Keep all fields clear at least half a mile downwind. - Who the hell are you? - Kyle Steele, NSA. Captain, I need to speak to this man alive. - So? - It's a matter of national security, sir. - Where the hell are you going? - Going inside. Listen, I don't care who you are. You got six minutes till we breach. Stone. I'm coming in unarmed. All right, close that door. Hands. Step forward. How you know I wouldn't shoot you the second you stepped through? I didn't. But I know this: You got five minutes till they knock that door down. So let's skip the chitchat. - Where's Pettibone? - Upstairs, dead. - You do it? - Lf I did it... ...you wouldn't know until I wanted you to. Now, turn around. Stone, this doesn't look too good, man. An escaped convict breaks into a house with an automatic in hand... ...and a dead man upstairs. - I didn't break in. Now, move. You didn't break in here? So the general invited you over for a nightcap? What happened? You guys felt like playing Russian roulette? This is not my gun. - You expect me to buy that line? - It's not a line, it's the truth. - They set me up. - Who set you up? - Deckert. - Deckert. Secretary of Defence Deckert. He clipped Gibbons when he got too close. And now Pettibone. Too close to what? Stone, we have three minutes. Level with me. Why are we here? Why'd you go after Pettibone? I didn't go after nobody. I don't even know the guy. Never seen him before in my life. Easy. That sure looks a lot like you. Damn, they're good. Think now is really the best time for a snack? What they got out there, three teams? Flash-bangs, body armour, heat-scopes. Am I close? Stone, I wanna help you here, I really do. But if you run, you look guilty. Brother, I was born looking guilty. And now... ...it's time for you to go. Where is he? Where is he? Captain, I got him. Looks like upstairs bathroom. Okay, go get him. This is the last known photograph of the suspect. - Cute picture. - Yeah. Haircut suits you, definitely. - Near Charlottesville, Virginia. The assailant is assumed to be armed and dangerous. One of General Pettibone's closest friends... ... was Defence Secretary George Deck ert. Jack Pettibone was a dear friend of mine. And tonight, this nation has lost a great patriot. And his quiet contributions will be properly recorded... ... in history books yet to be written. From base to base, Camp Pendleton to Fort Bragg... ... General Pettibone's troops are en route... ... to Washington D. C. For the funeral. They're not coming for the funeral. Same blood, same mud. Pettibone and Deckert both served for over 30 years together. So that means Pettibone's troops are also...? - Deckert's. - Correct. What's that got to do with the funeral? The perfect cover. Deckert does the guest list... ...only invites his boys to town. He's got his army. Now, he's gotta be loading up. How would he get his gear? All orders go through his department, the DOD. Right. You want me to hack in? To the U.S. Department of Defence? We're talking 500 acres of hardware. Cray supercomputers, encryption chips... ...not to mention more firewalls than the NSA, CIA and the IRS combined. Exactly. Hold my chips. You know, you don't have to wait up. You think I'd leave you alone with my car? What's so special about this one? Shelby Cobra prototype, Only three off the rack. We sold it for half a mil to some senator... ...who'll never take her out of first gear. Half a mil for a car? You been gone a while, D. Everything's more expensive now. I could see that. Come here. You've done real good, Lo. No rollbacks, part bins or stripped engines. It's a long way from Zeke's chop shop. Still got a few bins in the back. And I still get my hands dirty. Classic's still a classic. You remember the first time we dropped gears in this one? I remember three squad cars at 100-plus on the parkway. Oh, she was fast. Yes, she was. You remember all that damage we did in the back seat? That was a long time ago, D. Not for me. Ready to do some more damage? He shoots, he scores! College boy just pulled off the hack of the century. Requisition order. Deckert's bringing all his troops and armoured vehicles... ...through a naval base up the Potomac to the USS Independence. It's an aircraft carrier, man. Looks like we going upstate. Well, well. Daddy's little girl. Look, Gibbons, people will believe... - Stone. - You miss me? Apparently, we all did. She had me fooled too. Captain? Harris? Jackson? - What the hell is going on here? - It's your old unit. And you're gonna be joining them real soon. - What's she talking about? - Deckert. He set us up. - For what? - I don't know. I didn't get that far. I was hoping maybe you did. - You not going nowhere. - Neither are you. No, no, no. Don't worry about us. You know you should've killed that bitch! - Who triggered the alarm? - It's Stone. He's here. Liebo, get men fore and aft. Push him down here. Take him out now. Seal the hatch! You have green light. Repeat, take your best shot. Old Sergeant Cobb. You still too dumb to make captain. Lieutenant Stone. Blast from the past. - That's "Big Daddy Stone" to you. - So tell me, how was prison? You'll find out soon enough. And with a mouth like yours, they gonna love you on the inside. Let's go, let's go. Get him. Fire! Oh, I'm sorry, was that your ride? No, but yours is gonna take you straight to hell. Loading. Stand by. Now! - Goddamn it. - Man, that wasn't even close. Trucks, choppers. What's next? You gonna sink the ship? Only if you're still on it. Keep this up and you ain't gonna have nothing left, hillbilly. - Load. - Loaded. You and I have unfinished business, homeboy. Fire. Move! All right, come on. Let's go! - Hey! - What the hell is he doing? Where the hell you going? Over there. That way. Get that tank topside now. Move, move. Bravo Squad to flight deck now. Locked on. Fire now. Goddamn it! All dive teams in the water. Lock the area down. Zodiac One, sweep the stern. Zodiac Two, starboard bow, in the midships. Search Boat One and Search Boat Two... ... widen your radius and search the port side. Dive Team Number Three, report any visual. George, I'm addressing the nation tonight. So, what's the hang-up on the new military bill? Well, if you're reducing troops, closing bases... ...and cutting R&D, you leave us vulnerable. George, we need to increase international aid. We need to reverse this isolationist doctrine. Maybe then we can turn some of these enemies into allies. I know this doesn't particularly thrill you, George. But this is going to be my legacy. - Sir. - Now, the question is: Do I have your support? It goes without saying, Mr. President. Call for you. It's about the new Lincoln you ordered. - Yeah. - Downstairs. Your car. Come alone. Take a look. - It's a map of the Capitol. - A military map. - With attack routes, targets... - I see that. - Where'd you get it? - Upstate. Deckert's little boy scouts are gearing up for World War IV. They got tanks, choppers. - They got Gibbons. - What do you mean? Gibbons is not dead. He's locked up with half my old unit. - Upstate? - Correct. Deckert is setting them up for a fall. - Fall for what? - What do you think? This man is making a move on the U.S. Capitol. See this? Map came from National Recon. Yeah, Deckert's making a move. He's running security... ...for the State of the Union tonight. He's not attacking, he's guarding these targets. Oh, that's beautiful. Perfect cover. He's got his old crew suited and booted. Look, these boys don't play defence. Just offence. It's not enough. What if you're wrong? I was wrong. I thought you was more than just another suit. Sir, the security detail... ...they're all ex-military. - Yeah, I can see that. All of them served with Gibbons and Stone. - It's Deckert's unit. - Think we got something. World War IV. Anything the Defence Department needs to know? Sure it's nothing you don't already know, sir. - George Deckert. - Secretary Deckert... ...this is Agent Steele. Kyle, the secretary wanted to check in on the Gibbons case. I have a personal interest in the case. Captain Gibbons was a friend. Well, you can rest assured we're doing everything we can to find him. - Find him? - You know, we never did ID his body. Terrible thing, accident like that. Could happen to anyone. Tell me, Kyle, what did Darius Stone say to you? - What do you mean? - You were the last to talk to him... ...before he got away. He didn't say much. No, just a bunch of wild conspiracy theories, that's all. Sounds like Stone. Well, if you hear anything... I'll know who to chase down. Sir, could you tell me something? I've always wondered... ...how do you pick the men who protect the president? Simple. - I choose men I can trust. - Like Gibbons. Would've been good to have him there tonight, huh, sir? Oh, he'll be there. In spirit. I'm sure he will. Good luck, sir. Sounds like the right bank's running leaner than the left. You wanna richen her up, you're gonna have to remap the ECU. - What, are you surprised? - Yeah. Fact you know how to tune up a truck. I didn't always wear a suit. - How'd you find me? - It's my job, Darius. I'm very good at it. Can we talk? You were right. Deckert knew Gibbons was alive. Look at this. President, VP, Speaker of the House, secretary of state. The chain of command. He takes them out, he's what? - Deckert becomes the new president. - That's right. - Cleanest revolution in history. - Yeah. Why are you here? Call the White House. Can't. We don't know how deep this goes. So, what's your plan? Figure we gotta go outside the box on this one. How far outside the box are you prepared to go? Because to get us close to the Capitol... ...we're gonna need some brothers we can trust. Ain't no place like home. Man, y'all almost had me too. They got jokes, man. You hear that? - They got jokes. - No joke. - We need your help. - So why don't you go to the police? - We don't trust the police. - Heard that. Hold this, baby. One second. Man, you know we got your back. But this ain't got nothing to do with us. This got everything to do with you. Don't do it for the red, white and blue, do it for yourself. Do it for the right to hack and jack cars of the highest quality... ...on the same block as the White House. It's the American way of life, bro. Now, if you wanna protect that way of life... ...then you gotta step up and fight for it. Because if Deckert takes over, freedom won't be free for long. - Nice speech. - Yeah. The freedom part was a bit much, though. I got some federal heat. Immigration, IRS. Couple of homeboys unjustly accused. I do this for you, you'll hook us up? I'll do what I can. Fair enough. All right, fellas, get your gear together. We got some work to do. Janky, Kevlar panels. Killa, super jacks. Dizzle, heavy-duty roll cages. Assholes and elbows, gentlemen. Let's go. Toby. To deal with these guys, we're gonna need some serious gear. Well, it's about time. God, I am so glad to hear you say that, X. I got some stuff you're gonna love. Laser-scope... ...frequency lock, GPS autotracker. This'll tell you what perfume a chick's wearing... ...from 30 miles away. - That'll come in handy. So will these. Basic scramblers, jammers, circuit jacks. Whatever you need. This is the house special. I call this one The Glove. So does everybody else. Not everybody else has electro-charge pneumatic suction. Turn this bad boy on... See? Nothing. Nothing at all. Chill with the butt... Don't. Just... Hey, hey. Hey. Come on, man. Why you gotta play around here? Hey! We need firepower. Do you have anything that shoots bullets? I don't, but Homeland Security does. Lola. Come on, man, please. Okay. I'll just call the Pentagon and see if they deliver. We don't have to. They've been running weapons across country... ...in civilian trucks. Civilian trucks? - Man, I'm hungry. - You just ate five minutes ago. What if I go in the back and get a slice of cheese? You'd stop at one slice. What does Homeland Defence need with a truck full of cheese anyway? You ain't never heard of government cheese? Let's give them a little assistance. - Hi, boys. - Ladies. Look like you're overheated. - I know we are. - I mean your car. I'm not going out without a fight. - He's retarded. - Key's in the truck. Move the level, because the brakes get stuck. Hi, I'm Agent Shavers. We'll be commandeering your truck today. Man, we can't let nobody know a white guy hijacked us. We'll say it was 7 5 black guys. We got a truck full of guns, they pay us to haul cheese? - That's not cheese? - So, what you think, D-Train? This enough bang for you? God bless America. You're going to take the president out, aren't you, George? No, captain, you are. They pull the trigger, you take the fall. - No one would ever believe l... - What? Augustus Gibbons always fought the system. This week, that fight became a war. He took out his own NSA unit... ...broke a convict out of a maximum-security prison... ...staged his own death, ordered the murder of Jack Pettibone... ...and rallied his old troop of traitors for one last stand. I believe it. You know what your problem is, Auggie? You've never been able to see beyond the bend. And you've never been able to see beyond yourself. You've had your hero's funeral, Gibbons. This time, they're gonna bury you in a pine box in an unmarked grave. I'm not buried yet. He's one man, captain. What can one man do? Deckert's got all the streets locked down. Three blocks in every direction. There are some streets he don't know about. At East Capitol and Eighth Street... ...we use alleys and warehouses to bust out behind the Capitol. - Gonna have tanks waiting. - Leave the tanks to me. If it got wheels, we can jack it. Trust me, daddy-o. - All right, let's roll. - All right. Lock and load. Time to ride out. The fate of the free world in the hands of a bunch of hustlers and thieves. Why should tonight be any different? As you can see behind me, the president is just arriving... The nation is eager to hear the president's stance on pressing issues. Chief among them, the new military bill. Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States. Mr. Speak er, my fellow Americans... ...tonight I stand before you to report... ...that the state of our Union is strong. We are at a critical moment in our history. Nice. Get crunk, X. Come on, Steele, get crunk with us. We now need the courage to reevaluate... ...the course of modern American democracy... ...if we are to truly flourish and survive. Looks like we got a little block party up ahead. - Go through it. - Hold on. We must use understanding... ...and compassion... - They're shooting at us. - Welcome to the 'hood, college boy. ...and compromise to win battles... ...and not just the sacrifices... ...of the lives of our young men and women. Fellas... ...I don't mean to be a back-seat driver... ...but isn't that a dead end? - There's no such thing as a dead end. Now, that's what I'm talking about! Oh, shit. I think you might wanna back up right about now. Go, go, go. Everybody out now. - I told you they'd have tanks waiting. - And I told you... ...if it got wheels, we can jack it. Move it. Get those jacks out of there. Welcome to the first tank-jacking in history. We can and must endeavour... ...to win the hearts and minds of our enemies... ...and turn them into our allies. And so, my fellow Americans... ...I will ask you tonight to support this new... - What's going on? - We need to move you. Remain in your seats. No cause for alarm. Okay, let's put these dubs to work. You sure you know how to drive this thing? Just trying to get a feel for her. Yeah! I could get used to this. You know, somebody better leave a note. Okay, split off the vice president. - What are you doing? - Just following protocol, sir. We're in position. Code red. Code red. Small-arms fire, Capitol building. All units respond immediately. All right, Zeke, the tank is all yours. Hey, you know what to do. I'll take lead, you lay down cover. What do you mean you'll take lead? - I'm XXX. - Is this you, George? Are you doing this? Are you familiar with the word "treason"? You're a Jefferson man. "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time... ...with the blood of patriots." "And tyrants." That's the end of the quote. I will do whatever it takes to keep this nation safe and strong. Compassion? Understanding? What world are you living in? Get rid of him. Okay, Zeke, do it. Do it now. - Let's redecorate. - Fire in the hole. Two Team, 6 o'clock. One Team, 12. Sergeant. Get Gibbons up here. Roger that. We're on our way. Let's finish this. - Good shooting. - Navy SEALs. High scores, Coronado. Please. I got high score. But I beat them in '96. What, you don't read the newsletter? We're coming from the southwest halls. We'll be with you in 30... Drop it! Now! I said, drop it. What took you so damn long to get here? Same old Gibbons. Maybe I should put this back on. Don't get a "thank you" or a "happy to see you, Stone" or nothing. See? I told you you should have killed that bitch. Brav o to Sub Team. We can still make this work if we have Gibbons. Charlie, where the hell is he? I'm right here, general. Checkmate in three. You should have seen it coming. Give up while you still can, George. It's over. Things not going according to plan? Sir? Sergeant, sidearm. We'll fall back to the train. Captain, he's got to have a backup. What would it be? There's a presidential bullet train... ...three stories down for emergency evacuation. Go after him. We'll take care of this. - Sergeant. - You, you, out. Do what he says. No! Drive. Toby, I need a ride. Something fast. Listen up. I want three Black Hawks on that pad, ASAP. Clear the road. I got a car incoming. Stay clear of the building. Only security and military personnel may enter. Time to throw the last punch, lieutenant. Go get him. Heard you needed a ride. All civilians, remain where you are until cleared by security detail. How fast does she go? Let me know. - Yeah? - Steele, where's that train going? - North-northwest. Straight up l-95. - Got it. - Darius, wait a... - He's not a big fan of waiting. Neither am I. Let's go. There it is. Okay, get me closer. Faster. Sit down, Jim. Feels good, doesn't it? To get your hands dirty? Fuck you. Okay, let's see what half a million buys. I can't get a clean shot. Maybe you can't, but he can. They'll just keep coming, George. There's no way you're gonna hide. Why should I hide? The man that tried to save the president but failed? I'll be seen as a patriot. "Tried to save the president but..." You mean...? A national tragedy. Look at it this way: You might get your own holiday. Hillbilly, you need to lighten up. - Brakes are blown. I can't slow down. - We won't be needing you anymore. Move. - Okay, ready. - All right, here we go. Drop and slide, lieutenant. I don't think so. Can't hold it steady. Down. Just like old times, huh? Yeah. How's that jaw, general? I think of you every time I chew steak. And I thought of you every night I spent in prison. Go! Run! Sir... ...you're gonna have to jump. Almost in. I've been waiting for this for 10 years. Well, keep waiting. Your turn to do the dying, general. Wars come and go, but my soldiers stay eternal. What's that you said? Looks like there's a man who deserves a presidential commendation, sir. Yes. And then some. Yeah. And then some. The nation is in shock today in the aftermath of last night's... The assault on the Capitol has reverberated around the world... The death toll is unknown. Authorities say all assailants were killed. The attack was thwarted by a joint effort... ... from D. C. Police and federal agencies. A group of armed assailants managed to penetrate security... Sources confirm the president is secure. Secretary of Defence George Deck ert... ... was buried with full military honours today. Secretary Deck ert lost his life while trying to rescue the president... ... during the attack on the Capitol. He will be remembered as one of our nation's greatest heroes. I love this town. Now, more than ever, we need heroes. So it is with great pride... ... that I bestow this Congressional Medal of Honour... ... on Kyle Christopher Steele. And I hold this medal for the unknown soldier... ... wherever he may be. For wars come and go... ... but my soldiers, they stay eternal. Did the president just quote Tupac? Son of a bitch stole my line. So, what's this? You out? You know me, Lo. I'm only good at 100-plus with a couple of cops on my tail. And you got a good life here... That ought to keep me going another nine years. D... ...how fast did she go? Two-twenty, 225. The second-best ride of my life. D... ...you forgot something. Sir, I've got some ideas for the next XXX. I think it's my turn to choose now. Hold on, gentlemen. I pick the agents. I think we need to go even further off the grid next time. Fresh face. New model. I've got the perfect candidate.
