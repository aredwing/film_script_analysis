I swear that this is my real chest My right is bigger than my left That's true. We don't know just why we chose her Look at her, she's such a poser I'll prove to you that I'm legit I'll work hard and never quit Not, not, not Not gonna happen! You, you, you suck at being captain! Brit, Brit, Brit, your cheering is for shit Not you, Brit They're not your real tits You suck, Britney! Go, Pirates! Yeah! Gross. Britney Allen just farted. Britney. Britney. Britney Allen. I did not fart! Thank you for sharing. Gloss check. Soy cheese! Oh, my God. I have circles under my eyes. I look so old. I could pass for 23. You got plenty of sleep in class. Well, that's because I was up all night working on new cheers. You've managed to maintain a C average and work on new cheers? You're such an over-achiever. Yeah, Britney, we already win everything. Amber, it's not enough to win. I want to go down in cheer history. You already did. You made captain, and nobody can take that from you. Not even me. Majority rules, remember? Oh, not the vote thing again. You don't honestly expect me to apologize for winning captain over you, do you? Of course not. Besides, it's not the first time that Winnie's lost to you. Or the second, or third, or fourth... Oh, we get it. Then get over it, Winnie. I'm so over it. Can we not do this now? You're right. It's old news. And as your BFF... Oh, if we're speaking in IM, you're more like a BFH. Bitch from hell. MYOB. BMA. WTF, guys? Thanks. Half caf, no whip, no foam. Thanks guys. Thank you. Hey, baby. Hey. Can I have some? Sure. No, no, no. I didn't mean the coffee. Stop it, you're embarrassing me. What? What? Then I shouldn't do this, should I? Brad is so hot. Again, he's Britney's boyfriend. Get over it, Winnie. I'm so not over it, Amber. Brad, stop it. People are staring. What? Sweetie, sweetie, you sound like... You sound like such a virgin. I am a virgin. I'm a quarterback, babe, people expect me to score. Well, I want my first time to be special. I am special. Well, I mean, we have to be special. I don't want to be like those other girls. What, those other... Like what? Audrey, Shannon, Lisa... Yes. Those other girls. Look, babe, you're nothing like those girls. Well, prove it. If you can show me your commitment by the homecoming dance, then maybe. Yes! No, no. What? Two months? That two months is too long. That's two months too long. No, come on, don't make me wait that long, Brit. Brad, you've been waiting for me since ninth grade. Two months won't kill you. All right, fine. But at homecoming, it's on. Oh, it is so on. Go, Pirates! Cradle. Good job, guys. Let's do that one more time. Oh, come on, Brit. I could do that routine in my sleep. Sometimes I walk in my sleep. I wonder if I can cheer in my sleep. Wow! It worked. Let's take a break. Got you, buddy. If ever there was an argument for bulimia, it's Brianna's ass. Give her a break. You're the only one who wants a butt like an Olsen twin. Amber alert. Pacific Vista has never had a fat cheerleader. Well, Brianna's the best on the squad. So she gained a little weight over the summer. She doesn't look that bad. Are you kidding me? The girl's a cow. You have to talk to her. Britney, you don't have to say anything. It's your squad. Brit, if you don't say something to her, I will. Okay, fine, but after practice. Why wait? Hey, Brianna. Britney has something she wants to tell you. No, Winnie, not in front of everyone. Yeah, Winnie, that's so rude. Hi. Hi. Hey, what's up? Your weight, Brianna. No it's not. I weigh just a couple pounds more than last year. And that was pushing it. I didn't realize. Well, look, just lay off the snacks and with the extra workouts, the weight should come right off. What if it doesn't? Put it this way. Pacific Vista's never had a fat cheerleader. Wow, Brit. Why didn't you just rip out her belly ring? That would've been less painful. Don't worry. That's exactly how I would have handled it. Yeah, totally. There it was, another number one hit from Rihanna. Now, attention all high school cheerleaders, Rihanna is hosting an audition for her TV special. So, if you think you have what it takes, pay attention. You can download the contest rules right now on Cingular Source. Com. Now, with more hits, brace yourself, here they come, KXKB SoCal... Hi, Mommy. Hey. Guess what? We're going to be on television. What? Yes. Oh, hi, Daddy. Oh, hey, princess. What're you doing home? How was school? School was school. And how was practice? Great as usual. The squad loves my new routine. And plus, we're auditioning for a TV show. Oh, Britney, honey, that sounds fantastic. Did you hear that, Tim? Yes, Pam. TV. I heard. This is going to be a little more difficult than I thought. What's wrong? Britney, your father lost his job. And we're gonna have to take a pay cut. The company's relocating to Crenshaw Heights. Oh, Daddy, you'll have such a long commute. No, I won't, Britney. We are moving to Crenshaw Heights. I'm really going to miss you guys. I said, we are all moving to Crenshaw Heights. Are you insane? I just made captain! Honey, it's still early in the year. You'll just transfer to another school. Honey, you're smart, you're pretty, you're blonde. You'll make plenty of friends. It'll be fine. Yeah, fine for you guys. You're old. Your life is over. I am a senior, my boyfriend's a quarterback and I'm a cheerleader, damn it! If you leave, who's gonna help me remember my locker combination? Oh, Sierra, it's your birthday. My birthday is April. Sweetie, your combination is the digits of your birthday. Oh! What are digits? We're really going to miss you, Britney. IMYA. I miss you already, too. Oh, guys. I'm gonna MYSM. D-A-M-N. Sierra, you're not speaking IM. You're just spelling. Oh, well then, S-H-I-T. Come here, I love you. You know, Crenshaw Heights is only an hour away. We can still be friends. Yeah, but we can't enter the audition without a captain. Actually, we have a captain. Me. Get over yourself, Winnie. No, she's right. Spirit law states that if the head cheerleader has to step down, the next cheerleader with the highest amount of votes is captain. Thank you. And I promise I'll use everything you taught me. Wait, wait. Babe, you're not going to be a cheerleader anymore? I can't. I have put my heart and soul into this squad. Cheering with anyone else would just make me... A cheer whore. Exactly. My cheer days are over. You have to swear. Swear to us that you're never going to cheer again. Brit, you don't have to do this. I swear. Let's make it official. "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. "Now you're not a cheerleader... I can't do this. "...that must really suck." Brit. This is a sad, cheerless day. I know. Those poor dead pom-poms. Put them back. No! Leave her alone. She's screwing up everything. No! This is stupid. Please let me keep my pom-poms and I swear, as God is my witness, I will never do another toe-touch again! She lost. She's definitely lost. Damn. For real. OMG. Yo, Camille. You gotta check out this CD I just burned. Some of this shit ain't even out yet. That's hot. We gonna set it off this year. Okay. Hey, y'all should see the krump moves I've been working on for us. Jesse, it's cute you trying to be into choreography and stuff, but I got this. You just stick to finding us the beats, all right, boo? All right, cool. But one day, you'll come begging for what I got. Shoot, I'm begging now. Hook a sister up. Kirresha. What? You are too hot to beg. I know, but he just so fine, I'm willing to make an exception. Don't tease me, mami. Me gustan las chicas grandes. I don't know what you said, but me gustan, too, baby. He said he likes big girls. Now, why come when you say it, it don't sound cute at all? Look, he's the one who said it, all right? Don't hate 'cause he on me. Tyson! Damn, Camille. Look, you put it out there, and I'm just showing my appreciation. You stupid. Grow up. Love you, too. So immature. What's up? Hey. Looks like we finally about to get some snow on campus. Look y'all. Mall baby must've got separated from her mother. What's she doing here? I don't know. This ain't the OC. Maybe she's lost. Hey! Yo, Pop-Tart, you got any black in you? No. You want some? Oh, no, you didn't! Come on, man. OMG. Look what you did. Well, it's not like it's real. For real? Say what? And how would you know? Because this one is real. Oh, that's nice. Can I touch that? My mama bought me this purse. Oh, your mama. For sure. Yeah, yeah. Well, your mother must shop at the swap meets because that knock-off sucks. Oh, I know you didn't just talk about my mama. Kirresha, hold my shit. Take it. Oh, wait a second. Hold on... Camille. What? Don't do this. You're gonna get suspended. So? You think I'm gonna let this little Barbie-looking heifer come up here and talk about my mama? Heifer? Did you just call me fat? And I did not just talk about your mama. FYI, you did. You speak IM? NFW! Oh, no. This girl didn't called you the N word. Oh! Take them. I would never. Some of my best friends live next door to black people. Oh, hell, no. Camille, come on. We gonna be late to class. Yeah, she right, girl. We better go. I ain't trying to get detention. Count your blessings, white girl, 'cause you just got lucky. Cut you. I feel scared, maybe a little nauseous, but I definitely don't feel lucky. Oh, hold on, now. What is this, LAX? I have my ears pierced. Hello, Sherlock. Another piercing. They're my keys, you perv. Would you give the girl her bags? Thank you. Hey, what's wrong with you? Come on, man. Is this English? Are you Mrs. Webster? It is, I am, and you're late. Well, I was going through airport security. Class, meet Britney Allen. She's a transfer from Pacific Vista High. Hi, Britney. Hi. She's one of those PV bitches. Mendiga gringa. Well, Miss Allen, have a seat and copy the board. You want me to copy all of that? Can't you just give it to me in, like, a book? Unfortunately, we don't have enough books for everybody, and I'd hate to single you out by giving you one of your own. We wouldn't want the other students to think that you are more important than they are, now would we? No. Good guess. I know! You can e-mail it to me. You think if we don't have books, we would have computers? I'm glad you have a sense of humor. Now find a seat. Good morning, Crenshaw Heights... Excuse me. ... just a few announcements today. Excuse me. Coach Carter extends the Warriors' invitation to our... Excuse me. Excuse me? What the hell? Get your ass out of my face. Mrs. Webster, Parole Officer Don needs a deposition from you regarding yesterday's lockdown. Please come to the administration office as soon as possible. Class, I'll be right back. Thank you, and learn today. "Can't you just, like, give it to me in a book and then my servants can learn it for me? "And then I could spend, like, all day brushing my hair." Do you have any organic greens? Yummy. Hey, yo. Check this out. We got some new shit for y'all. Here we go now! Roll call! Roll call! My name is Leti Yeah I like to party Yeah And when I shake it Yeah The boys say, "Ai, mami" Roll call! My name, Camille Yeah Give you three wishes Yeah To see me shake it Yeah 'Cause I'm delicious Roll call! My name, Kirresha Yeah Get out my face Yeah And when I shake it Yeah It's like an earthquake Don't forget, everybody, pep rally after school, right? Enjoy the show, white girl? I didn't know you were a cheerleader. I'm the cheerleader. I'm captain. So? I was captain at my old school. And now you go to my school. So, I guess that makes you... nothing. Hey, Britney. Hey, Britney. We can't wait to see you at the homecoming dance. Send us a message. Hey, how's your new school? Don't join a gang. At least, not the first day. Bye! Bye! Hey, guys. Britney sent a video. Tears of joy. She's so happy. Oh, shit. My bad, shorty. Don't touch me. So, you just gonna lay there? I don't see how my day could get any worse. Tough first day? I've been there. Are you new, too? No, I transferred my sophomore year. But, man, was that hard. When did it get easier? Last Thursday. Great. I was joking. What's your name? Britney. Jesse. I guess I should get up now. Unless you want footprints on your forehead. Thanks. You're welcome. Weren't you headed... That way. Yeah. Yeah! Cheerleading tryouts tomorrow after school in the north gym. Now, your Warriors JV team! Damn, you must really be into me to be following me around all day. I didn't know you were a cheerleader. It's not usually the first thing I tell a girl. Why not? 'Cause the cute ones don't really go for queerleaders. I'm a cheerleader, too. Well, I was. I know. How? 'Cause your biceps are as hard as a rock. You got a little bit of a turn-out, but too many muscles for a dancer, so it's gymnast or cheerleader. You've been watching me. You got a nice ass, too. You coming to tryouts? No. I can never cheer again. Why not? Because I swore that I... It's complicated. Don't even waste your time, Jesse. She can't hang. Camille, you don't even know her. Oh, I know her. Miss fancy-fingernails- shimmy-shimmy lip-gloss- Barbie. She don't got what it takes to be a Warrior. Look, my old squad would have made yours look like newbies. Prove it. Yeah, show us what you got. Or what she don't got. And if I make the squad? Not likely. Not interested. Keep fronting, white girl. You ain't fooling nobody. So, all of y'all think y'all good enough to be cheerleaders. That's funny. Well, unless you can do this... Come on, Leti! Don't waste our time. And if you can't do this... Get them, Kirresha. Then why are you still here? And don't you think you're gonna be able to get by without being able to do this. Come on, boys. Let's go, Jesse. Bye-bye. Or this... That's right. That's right. Oh, now you see what it takes to really be a Warrior. This is more like it. Now, pay attention, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Now you can start. All right, this is how it's going down. I'm gonna do a routine and I'll do it a couple of times. But if you can't keep up, you're cut. Now, if anybody survives, then we'll decide if you're good enough to be a Warrior. Y'all got that? All right, follow me. Five, six, seven, eight. One and two and three and four, five, six, seven, eight. One and two and three and four, five, six... Watch those feet. One and two and three and four, five, six, seven, eight. One and two and three and four, five, six, seven... Let's try it. One and two and three and four, five, six, seven... Let's go. One and two and three and four, five, six... You can't keep up, white girl? One, two, three, four, five, six... Last time. One and two and three and four, five, six, seven, eight. One and two and three and four, five, six, seven, eight. One and two and three and four, five, six, seven, eight. One and two and three and four, One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. That's the best you got? Damn, vanilla latte got skills. Yeah, you've gotta put her on our squad. She was not that good. Girl, don't even trip, you know she was on point. Why are you fronting like that? You know she's was the business. All right, you what? Y'all need to chill. Hey, Barbie. It's Britney. Whoever. You get to call yourself a cheerleader again. IDTS. No thanks. You know, there are a hundred girls who would kill for this spot? Good. Then you don't need me. See you. Girl, we need her. We got to fill that spot, Camille. I said, no. So did she. Reality check, Camille. She's the only one with enough cheer experience. Powderpuff is as good as any of us. Word. Y'all, she's rude. Conceited. And she think she all that. Name one cheerleader who doesn't. Do it for the squad. What the hell? She's already acting like a Warrior. Look, we both know you don't have any place to fit in here except for the squad. What, are you cheer pimping now? What's that supposed to mean? I'm not a cheer whore. You're not a cheerleader, either. If you were, you'd have to cheer. 'Cause I hear PV is a cheer-or-die type of squad. Huh, and your squad couldn't touch us. Us? You don't cheer for them anymore. The way I see it, you got two choices here. Either be at our practice, or bitch from the bleachers by yourself. Rihanna TV special brought to you by Teen People magazine, so you cheerleaders get those routines... Hey, how'd it go? Did you join the squad? They hate me. Oh, they don't hate you. And I promised my friends that I would never cheer again. Well, what kind of friends would ask you to quit something that you love? You don't understand. Britney, honey, we can never give up cheering, not completely. I cheer for your daddy every night. Okay, you didn't need to hear that. But I also cheer for you. I even cheer for myself sometimes. Spirit is what makes life fun even when it isn't. And there's only one question here. Do you love cheerleading? Yes. Yes. Well, then, do what's right for you. And your real friends will just be happy that you're happy. Now come and help Mommy unpack. But our routines are choreographed for ten girls, not nine. And we gonna make it eight if you don't stop whining. Don't be getting mad at me because that chica blanca turned you down. Hey, Frosted Flake in the house. Hey, Buffy. Ready to be my baby's mama? Tyson. Do it again, and I'm plucking grapes. Or in your case, raisins. Got it? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Damn, Tyson, that's what your nasty ass gets. Hi, I'm Kirresha. Hi, I'm... Oh, girl, I know who you are. You was killing at the tryouts the other day. When I saw you, I was like, "Damn. That girl know how to cheer her butt off." What little butt you do have. We need to fatten you up just a little bit, baby. Have you ever had fried Twinkies? Fried Twinkies? So, what made you change your mind? Oh, I figured if I was cheering, this place might suck a little less. I love your school spirit. Everybody, this is Britney. What? Oh, nothing. I'm just surprised you know my name. I was expecting you to introduce me as White Girl. Oh? Well, my bad. Everybody, this white girl's name is Britney. You happy? Ecstatic. Good. Now we can get started. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Say check it out Say what? Warriors is our name And cheering is our game We've got winning on our mind And... We're mighty fine Yeah. See, that was good. I can't hear y'all. Again. Warriors is our name And cheering is our game We've got winning on our mind And... We're mighty fine Say what? We're mighty fine Crenshaw Heights! Britney Cheers, what was that? Spirit fingers. Everybody does spirit fingers. I've got a spirit finger for you. Oh, so you're the only one who can contribute ideas? That's right. This is not a cheer-ocracy. And there's room for one captain only. You understand that? Whatever. All right, we need to work on these stunts for this audition. What audition? The Rihanna TV special. We need them computers. You can visit my website, Cheerwhore. Com. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Go on, go on. One, two, three, four. Okay. Do it again. Winnie, can I stop now? Are you still thinking about food? Yes. Then, no. Keep running until you're not hungry. Why are we practicing out here? Britney always had us work out in the gym. There was a reason for that. Look, Britney's gone now, so I'm making some changes. Starting with the audition. Britney's routine will make her immoral. It's "immortal," Sierra. It's irrelevant, Amber. I'm captain now, so get over it. I am so not over it, Winnie. Watch and learn. What the... What are you doing? Somebody get that girl a pole. Yeah, for real. S-L-U- What does that spell? Winnie! No, it doesn't. You know, as captain, I could kick your ass off this squad. And as a black belt, I could just kick your ass. Yes, that was... You guys should... Wow. Yeah, Winnie. Winnie, Winnie, Winnie. Yep. I actually need a study partner for the algebra breast on Friday. Can you help me out? Yeah. I'd be happy to. All right. I'll swing by later then. What's up, Amber? You tell me, Brad. And this is why we practice in the gym! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! What are you doing? You're not doing it right. And one, two, three... Girls, what are you doing? Camille's not here yet? No. She left me in charge. We're supposed to be practicing the new routine. What are the boys doing? I don't know. Goofing around. They never listen to me. Come on. Hey, I said we're supposed to be practicing. I'll be right back. Nobody listens to me. Am I speaking English here? Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop it, guys! Violence never solves anything. Chill, we're krumping. What? Look and learn, Pixie Stick. There we go, Tyson! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Yeah. Give it, Jess. Yeah. How do you guys move so fast? I could probably show you better than I could tell you. Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't know what to do. It's like street theater. Improv the anger in you. I don't have any anger in me. You're a rich, white girl, stuck here in Crenshaw Heights. Please. You should be the angriest person in here. Stop it. Get mad. Get mad. Yeah, what? All right. Yeah, come on. Yeah, there's that anger. That's it, that's it, that's it. Come on. Here. There you go, there you go. Come on, get mad. Get mad. Now, you're tripping. You better get your girl, man. For real. All right, D. Go. Give it, Jess. Yeah. All right. That's right, that's right. Okay, white girl. Oh, no! Quarrel! Damn. Guess he brought it to you. That's right. That's right. That boy is fit. Oh, yeah? Yeah, he's popping his gasket. You're all right. Will you guys quit playing around? We're supposed to be practicing. I'm still in charge here, damn it. Hey, Leti, if we added some of this krumping, it could really get us noticed by Rihanna. No. If we change Camille's choreography, she'll be pissed. Yo, Leti. Camille ain't even here. If you're in charge, act like it. Don't tell me what to do. Come on. Try something new. Yeah, girl. We can always change it back. Yeah, don't be scared. I'm not scared. Leti, this could help us win. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Get it. It's good, yeah. That was great. That was so good. Pretty hot. That was great. Whose idea was this? Well, I came up with the steps. But we all contributed. Yeah. It was a group effort. I had nothing to do with it. So, do you like it? Hell, no. Camille, don't blame them. It was my idea to change the routine. Why? Because half of the moves in your routine are illegal. What are you? A cheer cop? You can't do that. No, girl, you can't do that. Judges take off points for vulgarity. I know the rules. Then why do you keep breaking them? Because the things we do get us noticed. Even when we don't win, they say we're the best. Wouldn't you rather they say you were winners? I mean, come on, Camille, if we play by the books and add this krumping, we can't lose. Is this the type of shit your old squad pulled on you? Changing cheers behind your back? No. And if there was one girl who thought she could run your squad better than you could, what would you have done to her? There was. I should've told her to stop. And see, that's the difference between me and you, white girl. I'm not telling you. Now let's practice this the way it's supposed to be. See? Y'all should've listened to me. Hey, you. You're late. Sorry. I had to study, sweetie. That's okay. I got some DVDs, and I thought we'd just stay in. Oh, that's the pizza. Can you get that while I get the soda? Yeah. Hey, large pepperoni, pineapple? Yeah, how much? $14.65. Dude, you get any action on this job? What are you talking about? You know, you ever get some ass? Like in those porn movies. Deliver a pizza to some desperate housewife. Tap that? That never happens in real life. You should try being the quarterback. We get ass up the ass. I mean... Well, you know what I mean. Yeah, I know what you mean. All right. Here, you know what? Keep the change, dude. Dude, thanks. That's the least I can do. Your job sucks. Loser. Dick. Asshole. What happened to you? I spilled a little. What were you and Jess... Guys talking about? What, the... Pizza. What, with the pizza guy? Yeah. Oh. Nothing. No, I was just giving him a hard time, that's all. I heard what you said, Brad. Britney, I was just screwing with him, okay? It was a joke. Well, it didn't sound like a joke. Well, it was, okay? Now, you better turn that frown upside down 'cause that's gonna put wrinkles in your pretty little head. And it's gonna look perfect for when we take pictures at the homecoming dance. So, you do realize you're only one of many squads auditioning for Rihanna? Yeah, we know there's a lot of competition, but we're ready for them. Amber, I can't come to school today, so you can lead practice. But videotape it. No excuses, just do it. Is there anything that makes your squad stand out from the others? Yeah. We better. And we really, really want this. Not just for ourselves, but for our schools. Well, good luck, Crenshaw Heights. Crenshaw Heights? Hey, turn... Oh, my God! I'm on TV! I'm on TV! No way. Got you, you little cheer slut. Come on. Touch down, Warriors! Go! Warriors! Crenshaw! Jump! Are you sure Britney's here? Positive. There's so many people here. How're we going to find her? Go, Go! Get up, just get up, get up! Go, go! Get up, get up! See? Told you. No way. B-R-I-T-N-E-Y You ain't got no alibi You're busted. Hell, yeah. You're busted. What are you guys doing here? We came to see you. Liar. I wanted to tell you guys. I just... But you didn't. Why not, Britney? We tell each other everything. You said you'd never cheer again. I know, Sierra, but it was so hard. Like seventh grade English hard? Harder. Especially for a cheer whore. Hold up. Who are you calling a ho? I've got a rape whistle and mace. Give me that. Back up, mall rat. Look, calm down. They're my friends. Shit, I don't even like you and I treat you like a better friend. Good, because she's going to need one. Let's go, Winnie. Oh, hey, Britney, you dropped something. What? Your face. What is your problem? Let's see. Now that you're gone, and your reputation is trashed, I don't believe I have a problem. You want me to cut her? You miss cheering for them, don't you? No. Maybe. Well, you better figure it out, because you need to decide who you're cheering for. You're watching Cheer TV! Rihanna Cheer-Off Countdown The odds-on favorite in next month's competition for the Rihanna TV special is Pacific Vista. We practice it every single day, getting it perfect. Discipline and precision keep them on top of their cheer tier. One, two, three... As captain Winnie Harper says, We always bring it, and we always win. Well, good luck, Pacific Vista. Go, Pirates! Watch and learn. All right, y'all. Come here, come here. Before we start, I have an announcement. And I'm only going to say this once, so pay attention. Look, we're gonna use these steps y'all came up with as a team. Wait a second. I've been telling you since day one, add krumping, and you've just blown me off... Look, are y'all done? I'm not... Yeah, she is. Then get your little white ass over here and teach me the steps. What's the matter with her? You know, I think it's caffeine withdrawal. Coffee's like crack to white people. I guess. I want those calves to burn. Five more. Come on, you guys. We need to go over this new choreography. Jesse, show us how it's supposed to go. That thing kind of suits you. Five, six, seven, eight. Three, four, five and six. What are they doing? It's a helicopter. No, I know what it is. It's dangerous. Why are they doing it? Because I said so. Push! Come on. Come on. Five, six, seven, eight. Five, six, seven, eight. Okay. Hold it, hold it. ...six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Good job. Happy Halloween! Trick or treat? How about treat? Can you hand me the white? Thanks. Come on, you guys. How many times do we have to do this? Finally. One, two. Good work, y'all. That routine was the business, right? Yeah. We're only gonna have one chance, y'all, to clean that up in the game this Friday against Pomona. All right. Right. Bye, y'all. See you, Camille. Britney. Hey, hey. Brit. Let's go to the beach. In November? I thought we were going to the beach. This is the beach. Tar beach. That's what they called it where my grandparents hooked up. Where did they immigrate from? Brooklyn. For real. They say it was really dangerous back in the day. Funny thing is, they moved here to keep their kids away from gangs. Wrong. Everything looks better up here. Things do when you step back and take a good look. You know, Camille's right about me. The squad's the only place I'll ever fit in. But she needs to know she can't mess with me. Camille can take care of herself. She used to be a gangbanger. What? She could kill me! I'm playing with you, Britney. That is so not funny! I saw Boyz n The Hood. And I saw Clueless, but I still came up here with you. Yeah. Guess that shows how little we know about each other. So far. Jesse, I have a... I thought you wanted me to. I did, but... I have a... I have to go. Who's playing with who? So, now you call me back? Look, I know you're mad at me, but I have dirt. Spill. Okay. I kissed another boy tonight. Who? Where? His name's Jesse. On the mouth. No. Yes. What if Brad finds out? Brad's been studying with Winnie. So? He's our star athlete, Brit. When did he ever study? So, when you say study, you mean... Look, we both know the only reason she wants Brad is because he's yours. So, what are you going to do about it? I don't know. Well, you better figure it out before the homecoming dance Friday. Oh, shit. I totally forgot about the dance. What am I going to do? IDK, but you really need to think about this. You've already lost your team. Do you want to lose Brad, too? ...high school boys. They be all up on you and stuff. I know, girl. They be doing the most. Who you going with? Well, I was thinking... Hey, guys. I have some bad news. What's up? I can't cheer at the game on Friday. Why not? Because... This better be good. Oh, it is. My dog died. You're missing our game for a dog? He wasn't just any dog. I've had him since I was a little girl. What the dog's name? Nike. His name was Nike. Wait. You named your dog after a shoe? Your sister's named after a car. No, Mercedes is named after my grandmother. Whatever. Anyway, Nike's memorial service is on Friday. You're having a funeral for a dog? He wasn't just a dog. He was a member of the family. Dang, man. White people are crazy about their pets. Yes, we are. And I know you'll hate me for missing the game, but I know Nike would have wanted it this way. Hey, who am I to stand between a white girl and her dead dog? Thank you, Camille. Hey, Brit. Hurry up, okay? It's a long drive back to Pacific Vista. I'm almost ready! Hey, yo. Britney lives here? I've delivered here. Damn, my house is nicer than this. I'll get it. Hey, it's the pizza dude. Man, you're a cheer-queer, too? You're never going to get laid. Brad, who was at the... Wow. You people are really dressed up for a dog's funeral. Oh, babe, did your dog die? Wait a minute. No. You don't have a dog, do you? Look, Brad, I'll explain it to you later. Jesse, what are you guys doing here? She told me about your dog, so I came along to offer my condolences. But I see you've already been condoled. Dude, you have a problem? Dude, step off. Dude, I will beat you down. Dude, I'll beat the dude out of you. Whoa, whoa! Enough. Look, I never had a dog. I just... I just needed an excuse to get out of the game tonight. Why? Because I promised I'd go to homecoming with Brad. And Brad is... Her boyfriend. Yeah, see, it's funny 'cause she never mentioned a boyfriend. She never mentioned a lot of things. Like the fact that she's a liar. I mean, were you even really a captain or did you make that shit up, too? Britney, what's going on? Look, it's just a misunderstanding. Yeah, I misunderstood a lot. You're off the squad. For missing one game? No. For finally deciding who you're cheering for. Hey, I've got a surprise for you. Just go. Okay. Hold on. Hey, hey! Brad, is this what I think it is? Well, open it up. It's a surprise. I wanted tonight to be special or something. What is this? That is our room key. You're welcome. You know, I just figured your first time might be a little bit more special and romantic if you had it in a Marriott. Brad, it doesn't matter where we are. I'm not ready. You know what, Brit? This little tease game you're doing? It's getting pretty old. Oh, really? Is that why you started sneaking around with Winnie? What? Now is the time. Get your ass up. Okay. Who told you that? Amber? It was Amber. You know what? She was making that up. And why would she do that? Oh, I don't know. Jealousy, maybe. You know how many girls want me at this school? It's ridiculous. Well, the question is how many of them do you want? Britney. Hi, sweetie. Glad you made it. I'm so sorry for not telling you guys about me cheering again. I totally understand why you didn't, especially after seeing that cheer-trocity of a squad. Can you say nasty? Nasty. They're like the bottom of the cheer tier. There is this one girl that is so fat, she looks like she swallowed two Briannas. Her name is Kirresha, and she's got more heart in one ass cheek than you do in your entire body. She's a real friend. Then you're done. And why is that? Because after you make friends with those people, you start shopping with them, then you're dating one, and the next thing you know, you're going to be on some bad talk show screaming at your baby daddy. What? I cannot believe you just said that. Yeah, that's so racist. Oh, bite me, Crouching Tiger. Winnie, you're such a candy cane. And you're such a wigger. Oh, that's it. Brad, hold my shit. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'm not gonna get any ass from you, but I'll hold your purse, yeah. Way to make me feel like a man, Brit. Let's do a cheer. Now? In the middle of a dance? And a fight? Let's do it for all timer's sake. That's old times' sake. You say tomato. I say potato. What do you think, Winnie? I think Britney doesn't have what it takes to be a Pirate anymore. That sounds like a challenge to me, Brit. Oh, I'm sure it was meant as an insult. Everybody. Kill the music, Ronnie. Everybody make room for us, please. We have a special surprise. Our ex-cheer captain, Britney Allen, is with us tonight. So, in her honor, we would like to do our Pirate introduction cheer for you. Although I'm captain now, I think Britney should lead us. Thanks, Winnie. Especially since you're not the captain at your new school. Hey, Amber Hey, what? Introduce yourself No way! Introduce yourself Okay One, two, three, four, five My name is Amber, and I say hi Six, seven, eight, nine, ten Back it up and meet my friend Hey, Winnie Hey, what? Introduce yourself No way Introduce yourself Okay One, two, three, four, five My name is Winnie and I say hi Six, seven, eight, nine, ten Back it up and meet my friend Hey, Britney Hey, what? Introduce yourself No way Introduce yourself Okay Roll call My name is Britney What? I cheer so strong Okay So when I shake it Yeah You'd better bring it on Break it down now Yeah! My name's Sierra We should do our cheers like Britney. Shut up! Welcome back, Britney. But now it's time to announce this year's homecoming king and queen. Hey, shabooya. In case you change your mind, we have that hotel room till noon tomorrow. Okay? Well, no surprise here, Pacific Vista. Your homecoming king is Brad Warner! Great, now he's really going to want to celebrate. I'm sure it won't be with you. He only brought you here because he feels sorry for you, and he didn't want to dump you over the phone. Really? Well, if he wanted to break up with me, Winnie, then why'd he get us a room? And this year's queen is Winnie Harper! Congratulations. Winnie! I had sex with Brad Warner. What? What? Oh, my God. How do you like that, Britney? I finally beat you at something. Now tell her, Brad. What are you doing? Britney, Britney, Britney! For once it's not going to be all about you. Now tell her. Okay, babe. Babe, okay, I know this looks bad, okay? It's not as bad as it sounds. I was thinking of you the whole time. What, the whole two minutes? Brad, Winnie. Thank you. What? Brad, I can't tell you how much of a relief it is not to be your girlfriend anymore. Because... Well, you're a pig. And Winnie, you're just too much of a backstabber to have any real friends. But there's one thing you're right about. I don't have what it takes to be a Pirate anymore. You guys enjoy the rest of your night. Go, girl! Oh, no, she didn't! She got her nerve. What do you want? Look, I never should have ditched you guys for some stupid dance. I'm sorry. Sorry don't make up or dissing us. Yeah, I know. I thought I needed to be the leader, but it turns out I just needed to be a part of the squad. And now it's too late. But I wanted to come wish you guys good luck, and I'll be proud to watch you win. Well, thanks, and see you. Look, it's hip-hop Barbie and her Wu-Tang Clan. You better get your friend before she gets a beat down. Oh, please do. We're not friends. We never were. Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. I could just cry. But I won't. Well, you will be crying when they beat you. When they beat us? Don't tell me you're not cheering with them anymore. I thought once you go black, you never go back. FYI, it doesn't matter whether I'm cheering with them or not. I know how good they are. Oh, you've lost your cheer-sanity if you think this pathetic little squad can even compete with us. Oh, I know they can. No. So, you'd better bring it all, white girl. Oh, "white girl"? Remember when you used to be one? But don't act like you forget. You know we always bring it, white trash. Please let me cut her. Look, Camille. I don't know what their routines are like, but I do know that they've really good gymnasts, so they'll probably throw some fancy stunts. But what you guys have that they don't is your spirit, so you really got to go for it if you want to win. You mean, if we want to win. Wait, are you going to let me cheer with you guys? I kind of have to for the way you stood up for us, Britney. You called me Britney. Go get dressed, white girl. I don't have to. Oh, so she just knew I was gonna let her cheer, huh? No, but I was hoping you would. Come on. Let's go whoop some PV ass, y'all. Hell yeah! Hell yeah! All right. Okay. We'll work on it. Yeah. Hey. Hey, what's up? Camille's gonna let me cheer with you guys. Cool. I guess you always get everything you want, huh? Not everything. Hi, I'm Swin Cash, and I'll be your announcer for this event. Whoa, whoa. Swin Cash. Yo, wasn't she playing for the Detroit Shock? Pro B-ball players, hot cheerleaders, pom-poms. It's like a real live beer commercial up in here. You know what I'm saying, Jess? Well, I see you're all as excited as I am. Man, why don't you just go talk to her? Talk to who? I'm horny, okay? Not stupid. You should tell Britney how you feel. She's got a boyfriend. Y'all ready to give a warm welcome to the host... Come on, y'all. We're about to start. ... and the reason we're all here today, and one of my closest girls, Rihanna! Oh, my God! That's Rihanna! Oh, oh, that's Rihanna! Oh, my goodness! Did you see that? Oh, my goodness! It's Rihanna! Oh, my God! Rihanna! I'm so excited to be here. That's how them girls were sounding when they see Rihanna. So we have a long day ahead of us... It's ridiculous. ... 'cause each school get to perform their routine for the judges, then the two best squads will come back and perform for me and I will pick the winner. That squad will get to join me in a TV performance that will be shown worldwide. But more important than that, you will win brand new computers for your school. Hell to the yeah. Okay, so let's do this! Let's go, Crenshaw! Let's go! Five, six, seven, eight. One. Go, girl! Yeah! Bring it down. Bring it, y'all! That's it, now. Bring it home. Yeah! Give it up for Crenshaw Heights, y'all. And now, give it up for the Patriots! Did you see the judges dropping? Man, we gonna win this, y'all. Calm down. Calm down, everybody. It's gonna be hard to top what we just did. Our shit is tighter than Kirresha's sports bra. Okay! All right, it shrunk. Ladies and gentlemen, three-time Southern California high school champs, Pacific Vista! Three-time Southern California champions, Pacific Vista. Our next competitors are here representing Lincoln High. Put your hands together for the Patriots. What the hell? It's that stupid diet you've had her on. She hasn't eaten all day. Well, do something. We need her for the competition. What do you want me to do? Shove a Snickers down her throat. Okay. Oh, no. Brianna. Something's wrong. Go check it out. Give it up for the Patriots. I need a cheerleader. A skinny cheerleader. What's wrong? It's all your fault. You're the one who called her fat. Shut up, Winnie. Is Brianna sick? She fainted. She's been starving herself to stay on the squad. It is all my fault. Brianna, how do you feel? Fine, now. Do you know how long it's been since I've had chocolate? No, but I owe you an apology. Oh, God. Now I'm going to be sick. Look, I never should have embarrassed you about your weight. It's okay. I got a big ass. It runs in my family. We're just a big-ass family. Are you gonna be okay to go back in it if we make the finals? Yeah, I'm fine. But thanks for being so concerned. Good luck. Thanks. You, too. Is everything okay? With her, yes. With us, no. And now, let's welcome the Tigers. Well, I can tell when something ain't my business. Come on here, y'all. Boy, this don't concern you. Wait, but Jesse don't have game like I do. Good, then he won't mess it up. Jesse, you need to know that I broke up with Brad the night of the dance. I'd be more impressed if you broke up with him the night we kissed. I just... I... I couldn't let go of my old life. The closer I got to you, the less important it all seemed. So what's important to you now? I can show you better than I can tell you. Do it again. Well, I'll be damned. The boy does have game. All right, we'll hear the judges' decision in a moment. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, Rihanna. Now let's hear it for Swin Cash and our fabulous judges, Tony G and Eric Little. So, are you ready to hear the finalists? Okay. Come on up, the Pacific Vista Pirates! Now let's see who you're competing against. Give it up for the Crenshaw Heights Warriors! All right, Crenshaw! Congratulations to both squads. But your work has just begun. You've impressed the judges, but now you have to impress me. So you up for it? Of course. Yeah! All right. We'll flip a coin to see who goes first. Call it, PV. It's a quarter. Stop talking. Heads. Heads it is. PV goes first. Watch and learn. Okay, show us what not to do. Looks like we're gonna have a little rivalry coming up. The final challenge starts in 15 minutes. Back off! Change the full twist to a double, add the helicopter toss, and finish with the three-high pyramid. You know those stunts are against the rules, Winnie. There are no rules, idiot. This is not a sanctioned event, and the judges are gone, so we go for it. Come on, you guys. Go, Amber! Man, they're as good as you said. Hardcore. Cheer or die. They ditched the safety rules. I hope no one gets hurt. We don't have any shit like this ready. Shit, we don't have any shit like that at all. Just what we can dream up on the streets. Everything we are is ghetto. The krumping, the clothes. I just thought of something to shake them up. Look at their steps. Yeah. I mean, they were pretty repetitive in the semifinals. Exactly. Do you remember my tryouts? Yeah. Oh, hell, yeah. Y'all, check this out. Come here, come here. Remember how it went down at Britney's tryouts when she mimicked my combination? You saw PV's choreography. Hunch up twice, arms circle, high V, hip thrust... Let's go! Okay, let's go. Come on, let's get it. Come on, let's do this. Left. Turn Right. One. One. You guys. Oh, my God. Come on. Yes. Work it. Come on, guys! Pirates! Let's show them the street, y'all! Yeah, come on. Krump it, krump it. That's right. Back up. Back up. Get off the floor. Yeah. What the hell! Six, seven, eight. Shake it, mami. All right, everybody. That was Crenshaw Heights and the Pacific Vista Pirates. Just amazing, wasn't it? All right. They totally ruined our performance with that gang violence. They should be disqualified or arrested. Sorry, but you don't make the rules. I do. It's not our fault you couldn't bring it, Winnie. I told you we should do more cheers like that. Again. Shut up. No, Winnie, you shut up. Wait, did I mean to say that? Yeah, I did. Winnie, shut up. I don't have to shut up. I'm captain. Yeah, and ever since you became captain, you've been a bigger pain in our asses than before. Oh, like I care. There's nothing you can do about it. Actually, spirit law states that if there's ever a cheer mutiny, that the squad can vote to replace their captain, effective immediately. You stay out of this. You're not a part of our squad anymore. Right, Amber? If you vote to replace Winnie as captain, raise your hand. I'd do it. Yeah, I vote. Hear, hear. I should say so. Rihanna, come on. If anyone deserves to be on TV, it's me. Look at them. They're so ghetto. What? You know what, Winnie? I've learned that a lot of talented people come out of the ghetto. I didn't mean it like that. Yes, you did. But that's okay. I knew you'd understand. Oh, I do. And that's why I don't judge people by where they come from, I judge them by what they bring to the table. Everybody, give it up for our winners, the kids who bring it all, the Crenshaw Heights Warriors! Warriors! Crenshaw! Jump! Hey, Britney. Meet our new captain. Congratulations. Oh, I want you guys to meet some people. Now? Who? Guys, guys, guys. I want you to meet my friends. This is Amber, Sierra and Brianna. This is Kirresha, Tyson, Leti, Jesse and this is Camille. Hi. Hi. Girl, you look like you eat Twinkies. I do. Really? Yeah. You ever have them fried? No. Hi, Mom. Sorry. Jump!
