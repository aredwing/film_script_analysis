Sean,did I ever told you about this? -No - Sean,did I ever told you about this? - No -Can I tell you about this. True story! -Tell me about the penguin. Not only that the penguin crossed the desert, Seany. But in the middle of summer, in a 76 Pinto. Anyway,he was driving along in his fucking Pinto And it starts making these weird noises that hes never heard before. So you could imagine, he gets all nervous and shit "Oh No, no, no, gi, gi, gi." Is that the car making the noise or is that the penguin? The penguin was making that noise. So as he drives along he decides to take it into the shop. So he walks out to the mechanic and says Hey there brother! Hows it goin? Can you help me out here? The mechanic looks down and said Sure litte buddy, I can help you out... but Ive got to tell you Im a little busy right now its going to take a while. But theres an ice cream parlor right across the street So he walks across the street Sats down in front of the store and orders a big beautiful bowl of vanilla ice cream. Puts it down in front of him but theres a problem. Hes got flippers! He cant grab a spoon like you and me, Sean. He cant do it. Hes looking down in his vanilla ice cream.. "Shit, fuck it! He starts diving in, Diving in with his flippers He flipping and flopping. The ice cream is on his chest On his beak, he is a rabid. Anyway,he finishes up his ice cream, walks across the street. Goes back to the mechanic and goes So what do you think? He looks up at him from under the hood and goes "It looks like you blew a seal My penguin says "No, no, no! I swear it's ice cream... ...It's just ice cream. "You get it? It is a true fucking story, man. Yeah,its a true story... its not funny story though. Hey Wyatt, we are a few blocks out. You, Trey and Franco got back. Me and Dave at the front. Hey remember,this assholes got nothing to loose So you all watch yourselves. You got it boss,this motherfucker aint going nowhere. -Wyatt, here we go. This is it. -We are here. Who the hell,man? What do you want? Police department. What the fuck do you want? What do we want? For starters,open the door asshole Before we kick it in. Look, dont get all excited. Youre all in very dangerous place. Ain't you roll me,I'm trying to figure out who I'm opening this door for. Now you know. Its the fucking NOPD bitch! so open the fucking door. Bitch? alright Mr. Popo, you got it. Let me see some ID first. You fucking kidding me? Okay, J ... yo-yo... Here it is? How is that working for you? Code Red, code red... I've got an officer down! Officer down! Shots fired.. 108 I got you,man. Come on, mothefucker! Goddamn it! I need a medic at Euturp O.C. Hayley Officer down, I repeat... I need a medic ASAP. Stay with me Dave. Stay with me. Code Red! Code Red! Officer down!Shots fired... 180. Officer down! Dave, don't you fucking die on me man. Stay with me. - Its gonna be alright,man. - shut the fuck up. Sorry, man... Reno... Hang on, Tray! They are coming. Fuck! You motherfuckers! You fucked Reno up... Lets go buddy. The medic's coming. It will take a lot more of you motherfuckers to fuck me up! Fucker! Look at me, motherfucker! Look at me. - Can you believe this? - So what do we know? Well,besides this poor bastard, you got ...the grandmother and the mom, the little boy and his sister. So what is all this white residue? It looks like Fire extinguisher spray. I know this sounds a little out there. But based upon the multiple stages of the burns and the residue. It looks like they doused him with an accelerant, then ignited him. Then they extinguished him. Then they repeated the entire process at least two more times. Who owns the place? Whose paying the bills here? Lets see... a Malcolm Varanato. Varnado? Do you mean Malcolm Varnado? Varnado, yeah ok! That's right.. Why? you know him? He's a reporter for the Picayune. His big brother Weddo Varnado... also happens to be the biggest drug dealer in New Orleans. What the hell are you saying? Meaning? Meaning... we just stumble into Something way out of our pay grade. I'm looking at it, Mike. Its right in front of me. Come in. I don't care what you all heard. Truth ain't determined by a majority vote. Do you think I'm exaggerating? Why don't you all come down and take ride along the streets with us. Well that's convenient? You can call me back if you want to pick this up again. You know, one day... just one day. - I wish they would declare open season - ...on the politicians. - yeah. Amen. - How are you doing, Pete? - Good... - Thanks for stopping by. - Yeah. Anytime... What's the latest? What's going on? Well, a few things. One of them being a favor I need from you. Yeah, no problem. Shoot. Its about that reporter for the Picayune. Yeah, Weddos kid brother. Yeah, He is in a war path. Well, Malcolm was his pride and joy. So, if Weddo gets to those guys before we do? We'll be lucky if we find anything but pieces. Which brings us back to the favor. Homicide requested somebody from... ...Street crimes to way in. ... to lend them a hand and your name came up. Okay, no problem. Sounds easy enough. One other thing. Johnny Tran. His lawyer claims you nearly tried to kill him. I disarmed him. He has a 6-inch straight razor. and I think he got off easy. I've seen the pictures,Sean. It looks llike he got hit by a wrecking ball. Is that what this is about. Is that why you called me? Yeah, this is what this is about. Four complains in this many months. Then the shootout. Your shits out of control. Are you trying to blame me for Dave and Trey? No, no. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about what happened to the house after they got hit. You've seen Internal Affairs out there questioning your boys. Do you think they're not the least bit curious about some son of a bitch... at the end of the hallway, killed at point blank holding an empty weapon on his hand? It doesn't take a genius to figure out what happened. Look I know where you at. I do. I've been there myself. you know about that. But you keep heading down the path this dark... and I'll tell you something,son. ... You will never find your way back. - Is that it? - Yes, that's it. Hey, brother. What's going on? Colin?! What the hell are you doing here? Whats fine fucker doing out here How long have you been in town? I don't know not long... a couple of weeks. Where's the old lady? Where's Jacob at? They are not here right now. They're out of town... at the folks' house. Come on,brother. Lets go get a drink. No man. Its been a hell of a day. - I probably going to pack it in. - oh, you've gonna pack it in. - Alright, we'll drink here. - Okay. Alright... one drink. - Okay, your buying. - My boy, my boy! Hey Sugar, two Jamies! Was the storm is really bad as they said? Oh shit! Yeah man. Right where Letty's brokers, its like an atom bomb went off. the whole neighborhood's just gone. But the worst thing was watching people... Just way through the water right pass these bodies... like they we'ren't even there. I know I said it before but I want you to know that I really appreciate getting my grandfather out...I do. I drove by his house the other day. He totally fucking ride off. - How's he doing? - He's doing good,you know. and I'm moving with his sister down in Algers. What about you brother? You know. I little this, a little that. You know, I gotta dump right it up to you right after Fallujah. I've got a nice work for a security contract. - What crew? - Spartan. They paid mad money, brother. Yeah but that checks are only good if you live long enough to cash it, Collin. Well thats rich. Coming from somebody who chose to be a cop in this city. I'll take Baghdad over this warzone anyday. Thank you man. So whats this suddenly here out of nowhere? I do not know. I'm about to leave town again. And to tell you the truth, I'm not sure if I'm gonna come back. I just wanna see you one last time before I left. One last time? You're going somewhere? Great beyond? Have you ever done something ... Something you wished to God you could undo? You know I have. You have any luck making that right? No, it can't be done. That's what I thought. Yes. Now? No, Lewis. No, that's no good. I'll meet you down by the reservoir. Sorry brother, but I've gotta run. I'm going to meet somebody. Are you fucking kidding me? You talk to me about something like that, And now your gonna walk away from me. I almost forgot. I got Jacob a birthday present. It's a new movie with karate tiger. I got it in Bangkok. It is not even out yet. Just take a look at that. - Colin! Come on,man. What's going on? - It was good to see you brother. - Colin! Wait, my bad. You said you wanna a driver's license not a passport. Yes, California one if that's cool. That's fine. I set back one here Hold on one second. Lewis, did you get it? Well get it and get back here. Its gonna take one second here. Alright, are you ready? One, two ... No, fuck! its gonna hurt a little bit, mate. I didn't do anything. Please..I don't even know the guy. I didn't do anything. What are you doing? Stop! Hello Lewis, it's Tom again. I just thought I could give you another quick chingle... I hate to sound like another broken record,champ. But Sonny asked here to give you another call. to see if you could stop by studio As soon as you can, that would be great. Hope you are well and hope to see you. Alright. bye! This is ridiculous. Hey, Crowe! Listen,mate. I really don't think this is gonna work. This kid's gonna buy any of this bullshit. How about you cut me loose with some of the boys - ...to see what I can dig up. - yeah Renko, what do you say? Lets do it. See through the window boys. You know what, Sonny? I just had the strangest realization. You and I might be more likely than you ever thought. Bare with me on this, okay. We are both artists,right? Were granted, we have chosen to work... ...in a vastly different mediums ... Or canvasses if you will. But we both want the same thing, right? All we have to do is communicate with our most sincere intentions and desires. Isn't that right? Is not that right? So tell me again Sonny. Where was your little buddy Lewis... ...supposed to go a meeting? He went to go collect a downpayment. They left about an hour ago. He was supposed to be back by now. Where is he now? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe something went wrong. He went out with his girl. I swear to God I don't know. This makes me feel like we're back where we started. I'm trying. I'm trying. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever heard the legend of Baba Yaga? No! - Hey Will - Yeah? In the owner's cellphone I checked recent calls... They're all out going to the same two numbers. Dialed over and over again. Then do as you can to trace them. Its probably a waste of time but you'll never know. - Sean... Sean Riley? - Yeah. How are you doing? Detective Will Genz.. Nice to meet you. Yeah...Same here. - Who is the OIC? - That would be me. Ok. I'm Sorry, man. - Trahan sent me down here. - I know. Thanks for coming. We think we could you use on this one. What have you been working? Come on. I'll show you. - What? There's more? - A lot more. Mo, can you join us on the roof please. Okay, right behind you. Genz. I'll be right down. The press is here. Walk him through this. I'll be right back. Hey, Nick. Can you boys give us a minute. Alright... so we think this is the owner. Beaumont. - Is it Sonny? That's Sonny? - Yeah, you know him? Yeah I know him. A small time forger. Fake ID's, passports, credit cards that kind of stuff. Well, that explains what we found down stairs. I read the report on Weddo's kid brother. Do you think this is the same MO. Light him up,put him out, light him up again. Yeah, pretty much identical. Do you guys think this goes back to Weddo? You think different? I'm not saying that. But I tell you what... I just don't know anybody thats got the balls... ...to go heads up against Weddo like that. What are you looking for? Well Sonny has this little fucking buddy ...he hangs out named Lewis. - See that tattoo on Sonny's right calf? - Yeah Well If this is Lewis... There will be one right there too. See that was their dog, Bonny. So you mean to tell me this guy and Lewis, have a matching poodle tattoo. Yeah I guess it sounds stupid but you got to meet this dog I mean this is like the movie star of poodles Just like fucking Lassie. You know, tap out numbers with its paw. Turn around like a ballerina dump on command I mean, a pretty special fucking animal. So let me guess, all witnesses came down to C.R.S. What? - Can't Rmember Shit. - Yeah, pretty much. The way we see it. The kid downstairs were trying to score fake ID's when... Bam! The door gets kicked in. They didn't have time to react. they just got lit up right on the spot. Okay so, they do the triple downstairs. Drag Sonny and this kid up here for the barbeque. - Scared the shit out of him. - Yeah. By torturing this kid right in front of him over and over again. Then when they're done with him, They lit him up and left him twisting in the wind. So how can I help? To start... Introductions to Weddo ... Sonny's family and friends. Anyone else who may know why they'll be target for something like this. Alright, I'll see what I can do. I'm driving. By the way, when you walked in you were looking for something. - Yeah, strays. - Strays? Stray bullets. They weren't any. I'm not sure if you saw how tight those groupings were but that type of shot takes some serious talent. So you were checking out the shell cases. The shooters were all a couple of feet from each other, right? - So they have issue together. - Yeah or something. I think I know who we should talk to. There he is. Wait until you meet this genius. Mel. - Hey what's up, man? - I got a question for you. Come over here, I wanna talk to you. Right on, I'm good. Its alright, cool. Just come over here, I wanna talk to you. - Don't do it... Melvin. - Alright. If you take another step, I'm gonna knock the rest of your fucking teeth off. Get over here! Melvin! goddamn it. You son of a bitch! Fuck! - Nice hit! - Thanks. - What is this? - Whats what? Melvin, credit card fraud? I thought you were fucking stupid for that. - I am. - Well you just admit it to him. No, man. I don't admit a shit That's the old man's card. This is your old man's card. Rajeev Magambie? Are you kidding me? My mama's boyfriend. You do know that this coming thru the mail like they did That's a federal offense. Hey come on, tell me what you want. I'll give it to you. this isn't the phonebook hommie. Alright, your boy friend Lewis. That's easy, man.Just go see Sonny. He'll hook you up. We tried that, he's not gonna be much help. What about the other guy he's rolling with. I don't know. Last time I've seen him... They we're running around with some white dude Some crazy ass fool. ...from The Channel. Do you got a name? With a crack rolling name... some shit. Conner.. Cone Wade... - Colin? - That's it, Colin. Come on. Lets get out of here. Looks like today is your lucky day. Mo, what's happening? Talk to me. Sonny's cel? you got a trace on it. Hey Sean, wait one second. Text me the address. Shit! Sean. The door is open. You scared the hell out of me. Where are you going, Stacy? What? Where you going? The suitcase. I'm just going to my mom's for the weekend. Lies! - Fuck you, Sean! - Stacy, I saw your car outside. You've got everything you own in that piece of shit. Where are you going? What do you care. Where's Colin? How the fuck should I know I haven't seen him in two years. - Were you going to meet him. - I'm not. I wouldn't meet him anytime anywhere ever... goddamn it! Two years?! You haven't seen him in two years? What is this? No, that's my money. I've earned it. I'm getting out of here. I'm getting cleaned. I'm going to Florida. I got an apartment and everything... - Stop, goddamn it! I want the truth! - I'm not going to meet him. I gotta to call you right back,alright. You got to believe me. You better not be fucking lying to me. Fuck! I swear. I came home a couple of nights ago and I found Colin on the street. He was drunk and he was all coked out. He's talking nonsense, run off with some shit. He was freaking out, he was crying. and he gave me the money and he told me... Don't ask any questions just take it and get out of town. Did he say where he is going? Yeah he said he was going to see you. - What the hell was that? - What did your boy found out. I've got a trace on one of that numbers on Sonny's. This building in some dump in MLK. That was a quiet ride on the way over here. Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, I must have a lot on my mind. - Yeah like what? Colin? - Excuse me? He's a buddy of yours, right? Is he in some kind of trouble? Who'd be after him? Okay look, are you feeling left out? I don't know what he's into, okay? The guy is a goddamn magnet for trouble. So how long have you known him? My entire life...I've known him my whole life, Will. Every pile of shit I've ever stepped in Collin's been right at the center. Going back to what Stacy's talking about, did he? Did he what? - ... come see you. - Yes, last night. Last night... and you weren't going to tell me. - What did he want? - I don't know what he wants. As soon as I'm gonna find out though Trust me, you'll be the first person to know. - Are we gonna do this? - After you, sir. Well... Well hello, boys. Easy... ease up champions.

But something went really wrong. What do you mean something went really wrong? I need more fucking details than that. Reporters were saying that there were some kind of shootout. They're all dead, Crowe. Renko, Cole. All of them. How the fuck is this possible? Hello? That sall you have to say to, Raymond? That's it? Now Mr. Ricther wait... No,no, no. I'm done waiting. And from the sound of my last phone call with the company and so are they... I have tracked them down this far. this must have count for something. Of course it does,the counts thats why you are still capable of taking this call. You don't have to take this converstation in that direction. I'll come through, just give me a little more time. What you need is to accept the fact that is not remotely a possibility. And deliver as you promised you would. We worked didn't we, with the risk of stepping into this arena. That you did, but we've been working together for a very long time. Surely you can convince the company. Oh please Raymond, don't do this. This grambling, seriously I just can't stomach it. I can't. - All I'm asking you to do is... - Enough, enough. It is what it is. Nothing changes. You have time until midnight. - Midnight tomorrow. - Now you hold on, Richter. Das korovai. goddamn it, Ricther.hold on... Richter! Griff, I want you and Dekker find out What the hell went so fucking wrong! Let's go boys. - Hi! - Hey, baby. - Are you okay? - Yes,yes. I'm good.I'm fine. - Mostly because of this guy here. - Oh sorry. Sean, this is my beautiful wife Beth. - Hi, Beth. - Nice to meet you. My Princess Sarah ... and this is little Mad Max. Car ... Come on, Daddy. I will show you something. - Come on in. - Sean, I forgot to tell you, your staying for dinner. Thank you guys, this was really great. You're very welcome. Is it me, or they are being way too quiet. They're fine. So how'd you guys meet? You wanna tell him one of your versions or shall I tell the truth. We met in LSU. My car ran out of gas next to his dorm and he came to my rescue. - Lucky man. - ain't I? Sean what about you? Is there a Mrs. Riley? - Yes, there was. - Any kids? We had a son. His name was Jacob. He was six years old When he got diagnosed with leukemia. About a year and half ago, we lost him. Yeah.. so. She left after that. I guess she can't take a look at me Coz she reminds me of him, you know. - Sorry. - Yeah, I didn't know. No don't be sorry, guys. That's alright. Usually, I just make up bullshit story to tell people. because I don't want to be seem so pathetic. By the way, did I tell you what a beautiful family you guys have. Thank you. Especially your little princess over there. Oh man, Sarah what are you doing to this poor kid. Come here, buddy. No, we don't wanna be a princess that's not cool. He got somethings after his dad. Oh I bet you're enjoying this, aren't you? Lets go get you a fireman's hat or something. Thanks brother. You got a nice neighborhood. What's wrong man, are you alright? I'm sorry,man. Sorry, I froze up on you today. That's bullshit Will, get that out of your mind. You did exactly what anyone else would have done. Not you,man. I mean, you went in there after them like the odds were in your favor. It ain't the same thing. Its just different. Look, Will. When you came around that corner today, you didn't see me. You didn't see those guys with the guns. All you saw is the family you got inside. I don't have that. I ain't got that to lose that's the difference. There is a lesson out of every tragedy. What's that? My father...he was a preacher. If theres anything my old man ever thought me Is that everything happens for a purpose. Do you believe that? Tell me, what's the reason for a 4-year old boy ...to suffer in agony for 2 years. Is there a reason for that? Look just think about what happened today. That if things has gone different, Then I would be done lying cold on the street right now. Like it or not it was meant to be. Well, its easy to say that While you sit there, comfortable with your beer. Oh come on, man. Ain't it possible that what happened to you and your family... ... wasn't just random tragic bad luck? Maybe there's something greater at stake. What are you trying to say? That what happened today was something holy? I don't believe in miracles. I'm not a saint, bro. Today, for me and my family. Today you were. Alright, its late. You believe what you believe, I believe what I believe. Okay that's fair enough. What? What's that look. You want to scare me Why? you want to take me to church. - You read my mind, how about Sunday? - No. - You don't wanna go? - I don't. Come on, man. I'm gonna get my keys. Its late. and you gotta get some sleep. Yeah? Yeah,no problem. What going on? Where? I'm on my way. - Hey, what's up? - So, you sure its her? Yeah its her. You realize what this means, right? This is ain't about Weddo. this is all about your buddy Collin Alright, listen. Do you have any luck tracking that other number on Sonny's cellphone. Another deadend. Prepaid phone at a bogus address. Do me a favor, check that reporter's phone records, see if that same number pops up anywhere. - Do you think it's Colin's? - Alright, I've gotta go. I'll get back to you. - What do we got here, Sean? - It ain't good. - Do you know who it is? - Yeah.Her name is Stacey. I inteviewed her yesterday. I think she might be connected for more possible suspects. Possible... that would be improbable now, would it? Look,I hate to bring this up but we got a call from headquarters. The heat's being put on them from city hall and being hammered by press about the shooting yesterday. - They got you at the crosshairs. - They want to offer me up. - Kinda look that way. - How much time do I have? Tomorrow. - Is there any way around it? - I don't think so. Alright..Fuck 'em! Look, I need your help. Can you get the forensics to rush the ID's of those guys from the shootout? - Sean ... - Come on, Pete. I will do what I can. - Yeah. - I thought I was the smart one. - Colin called him. - About a dozen times. goddamn it. Why Malcom? Why a reporter? Yeah.He must got something big. The guy have something on these guys looking for him. Or something they don't want to go to the presss. - We got to get him before they do. - Alright, I'm on my way. Tell me what you know. You know everyone in this area. Hey, what's up, cuz? - Fools, are you lost or something? - Hey, keep rolling hommie. Where you get that? from a cracker jack box? What motherfucker, you want to get a closer look? Well, I love too.. fucking cops. - What the fuck is going on? - Who are you? Loose them. - Can you recognize me, white boy? - Yeah, I know who you are. That's good. And I guess we gotta cut the chase. I wanna know what you know. Are you fucking kidding me? Do I look like a humorous motherfucker to you? Somebody butchered my family. Roasted my baby brother alive. It took from me the only thing good, The only thing pure, I have ever hand in. We do not know shit. Wait. Please... please. You got this fucking wrong. This ain't about you,man. This ain't about you. What do you mean? I know this ain't about Malcolm. It's not about Malcolm. It's about Malcolm's job. Weddo, your brother was in the wrong place ...at the wrong fucking time, alright. I understand what your heads at,man. If I were you I would do the same fucking thing. But trust me, this ain't the way to handle this. - Yeah? then what is? - Let us do our jobs. Weddo, hunting and tracking people is what we are good at. We'll find this motherfucker. He's right. With us is your best chance ...to finding these guys before they skip town. Alright. We'll let you go away for now,cop. But know this brother. I'm gonna be a shadow on your ass, watching and waiting. One way or another.They're gonna a reckoning on this earth. Some motherfucker's definitely gotta reap buddy's soul. You heard me? Yeah, I understand. So we're right back where we started from? Let me check with Fed's first, if they have any luck with the prints. Yeah, we're on it. Will's upstairs on the phone right now. What did you find out? Nothing. Nobody knows anything. What about you guys? Forensics identified the burned victim from yesterday. Yeah, Lewis Cunter. - How did they tie in. - Lewis was Sonny's errand boy. And what about these guys? That's what we are just talking about. Its a strange deal. All the ID's we found on them... bogus! All of them? Yeah, but not the usual internet garbage. ...real high quality stuff. I honestly felt they were the real deal til I ran them. I want you to take a look at pretty boy over here. Here's something you might find interesting. They dug them out of his shoulder. At first, we thought they're bullet fragments. - So, what is it? - Shrapnel. That's what I was figuring... Check this one out. Forensics is guessing its from a 3-0-8 or bigger. There's another one in the meat locker. His got a Cyrillic tattoo on his forearm And what looks to be old white phosphorus ...burns scars peppered all over his back and shoulders. - War wounds. - Looks that way. - Well, that explains a lot. - How so? Yesterday, when I shot it out with these guys... Their weapon, tactics ... Ex-soldiers? More than that... These guys are professionals. Real deal serious. - That's just great. - What's going on, Sean? What have you get yourself into? So,Colin's trying to contact Weddos little brother, right? Right! Somehow the guys looking for him find out. They get to him first. Colin hears about it. Right. So he freaks out. He's got no other choice but to disappear. But without ID He can only run so far. Exactly. So he goes to Sonny, but they got to Sonny too. How the fuck these guys figure out Colin's reachin out to. They got access to his phone records. How? You said, you think these guys are good,right? Right. Maybe he made a mistake buying the phone. The credit card he used,or an alias they picked up on him. I don't know... or something. Whatever it was. They found out. Oh yeah.We pulled that off from the Australian greased at the parking lot. - When did Ray's re-open? - What did you say? Ray's.. That club was closed since the storm. I worked a homicide about two weeks ago across the street, ...and it was still shut down. Hang-on. Hello. What do you think of when you heard my name. I thought so. Is that why you didn't tell me about your boy? Or whether that Renee left you? God, I'm so sorry,man. I wish I could have been there for you. and done what? I don't know...something. Anything. I never helped you. I never did for you what you've done for me. Let me bring you in, just tell me what you're into. You need to let it go, Sean. You can't save me this time. I know that. They would come after me, you won't also be able to save yourself. Just tell me where you at, I will come get you. You're not listening... - Let it go, Sean. - Colin! Colin! I gotta tell you about Stacey! goddamn it! - Sean, its been over five years. - and? And.. So what's this napkin doing in this guy's pocket? Oh shit! Excuse me! Who are you looking for? - Stacey O'Neill. - Never heard of her. Anyways, should I? I'm sorry. I am Detective Riley, This is Detective Genz. And you are? Raymond Crowe, pleasure's mine.

Have you ever heard the story of Baba Yaga. Of course not, why would you. Where I come from... ...Little Odessa, everyone knows her name. You see, Baba Yaga was a witch. She fly around on her broom at night Looking for little boys and girls who misbehaved. When she found them, she'd creep into their rooms... and wrack their knuckles as hard as she could. She did that because when they wake up in the morning and see the bruises in their hands They would have known she was there. And they never would have done which was wrong ever again. You know, after Bosnia. After I left the agency. To be honest, I felt kinda lost. And I could hardly find a job, for myself, you know. The one job I did get was a night janitor at the city morgue. My friends thought that was strange, so they decided to call me Baba Yaga. I suppose they found that humorous. With me sweeping the floor with my silly little broom. So I decided to pay them a little visit. But I didn't wrack them on their knuckles ...with my silly little broom. I chopped their hands off... You see, my friends only ridiculed me. You and your friends you're trying to crucify me. I do not know what you're talking about. I swear I don't have anything to do with this. Wait, wait, wait! Come on,man. Stop! Please I have a family. You do? Yes, I have a wife, a little boy... ... And a little girl. Please don't do this. And you didn't find that important? Get Dekker on the phone. Playtime is over. I wanna pick up the family. No! I swear to God You touch my family I'll fucking kill you. Nevermind. It's him. Hey! I was just calling you. Dekker? Dekker? Shit. Its ringing. Go Crowe, get the fuck out of here. Lets move, goddamn it. Let's go! Come on! - Put this on. - No, wait! - Put it on! - Alright. - Are you ready? - Yes. You lock anybody else here. Don't let them out. Move! Move! Will, come on! He's gonna make a loop. He's gone! We'll cut him off. Son of a... Fuck you! Come on! Hey cop! Do you want me? Do you really fucking want me? Come and get me! Open your eyes. Open your fucking eyes! I told you this was coming. Finish him, Sean! Finish him! Sean, goddamn it! Just shoot him! Is this him? Can you recognize me white boy? People say I look like my baby brother, only prettier. Do you think you're the most ruthless motherfucker on the block? Please...this is New Orleans, white boy. You ain't seen nothing yet. Get him in the van. Wait! No! You can't do this to me.Wait! Let go of me. You motherfuck... Make a wish baby. Happy birthday, princess. We want some cupcakes! Yeah! Hey, where are you running off to. Well I'm just gonna drop... Listen, I got this for Sarah. They said its a petshop. Some are dogs, cats and stuff. Thank you, Sean. I don't know what else to say. Thank you so much. Mrs. Genz, remember me, your husband? We were just about to sneak out. Keep it up, there's more where that came from. That's my cue... - Lucky man. - Yes, sir. I will let you do your thing. I just came to drop that off for Sarah. Hey, come on. You're not gonna stay? No, I've got to go somewhere, got something to do... Alright, how about you come back after you're done. Yeah... Alright, I'll walk you out. Come on. - She's back. - Yeah, better, stronger and faster. Are you alright? Yeah, I think my nerves are still a little shocked. I know. I really thought it was over for me. But it wasn't. You're gonna be alright, trust me. Its just going to take a little time. I gotta go. And you gotta go back in there. What are you afraid of? That! - Chicken shit! - Yeah, you're right.
