This will have consequence, Mr Tovar. You will see. - Jesus, Mary and Joseph called. - Good morning, Mr Tovar. You made Mr Block look like a punk. What were you thinking? I was trying to make him look nice. - I'm sorry? - Younger, maybe. Mr. Block wasn't young, wasn't nice, he wasn't skinny. And painting his face up ain't gonna change that. I'm sorry. Our job is to make the deceased look good for the families. Now I got a lot on my mind right now, and you're not making things easier. The first eye witness accounts of this grisly development came from people who were understandably striking and almost incoherent ... - Aunt Lou? - Good morning, Junior. - You got a minute? - Always for you, Junior. Aunt Lou, I'll tell you. I've just about had it with that girl. - Service didn't go well? - No, it did not. DyeAnne cosmetized the body for viewing. I thought she was ready. Needless to say, Mrs Block was none too pleased. - Three strikes? - Well ... Yeah. Alright, I'll give DyeAnne her 2 weeks notice. You just pretend like you don't know anything. - Just got too much on my mind right now. - Of course you do. Thank you. Oh, got the Del Amos waiting in your office. And I set up an interview with a really nice young woman looking for a job. - Two appointments this morning? - Junior, she's a mortuary school graduate. You really should meet her. Real nice, smart. I know she can't replace Bobby Kimball, but ... if you get along with her, she could do Bobby's work. - An institute? - That's right. Graduated from P.I.M.S. You didn't say anything about salary, did you? Okay. No more appointments this week, right? The computer says ... No ... I gotta go check on something. I'll be right back. Just give the Del Amos ... some more copy of a magazine or something. - Well, you know I will. - Thank you. - ... over there and then we'll be able to give a more definite view. Thank you very much, Chief McHullond. This is Bill Cardill, WIIC, Teville Avenue. - Good morning, Gerald. - Morning, Russ. I'm just getting started here. I can see that. Russ, who's car is that? Oh, yeah. I was going to tell you. This guy came by ... What guy? Werner Gottshok, State Inspector Division of Funeral Cemetery. Russ, did this Gottshok guy say anything? He just handed me his card since there was no one around. And you just let him? He seems real official. I don't know, I thought you were expecting him or something. - I mean, he's from the state. - Where did he go? - The cemetery, the old hill, I think. - Oh hell! Russ, keep that cage locked! I will keep it locked, Gerald. Thing is, now I sometimes gonna walk out of here. Help me. Help me. I'm sorry, Mr Gottshok. I truly am. - What? - I didn't mean it to be this way. Russ, well I told you! No deliveries right now. Okay, stop, stop, stop! Find the guy? Yeah, I found the guy. That's all taken care of. No deliveries from them, until further notice. But they're with that company. I know what company they're with. You just go tell 'em. Okay, I'll tell 'em. I don't know. He doesn't want you here right now. - What's with the bloody shovel? - What? Bloody shovel. Why are you ...? Gophers. Forget about the damn shovel will you, Russ. - Have you left that door open today? - What? - No. - Big boy. Yes, for a couple of minutes. I went inside to get some water. - Shit! - What? Shit! That door locked now? - Yes - Give me the keys. What is the big deal? It couldn't have been opened for more than a couple of minutes. Morning, folks. I'm Gerald Tovar, your new Funeral Director. Francis Del Amo. - My wife, Honey. - Well, that's a sweet name. - It's nice to meet you, Mr Tovar. - How are you folks this morning? Can't complain. I'm sorry. There's no smoking in here. Right. So, what can Tovar & Son Mortuary do for you? Dad's in a nursing home, and they said it could be any time now. - So we thought we should make a plan. - Ahh, funeral package. We have a few to choose from. If you like, later we can look at the casket selection. We have mainly half couches, steel, fiberglass, wood. I like a nice oak myself. Well, we don't exactly know what Dad wants. But he has always been very ... frugal. Cheap. Nice. Well. I don't necessary recommend it, Mrs Del Amo but our most economical model is a cloth cover casket. We call it the "minimum casket". Basically, fiberboard covered with black felt. Dignified, very affordable. Mr. Tovar, since dad never really talked about it, and now we can't express his wishes We were thinking ... Cremation. I see. - Did I frighten you? - No, it wasn't you. Something happened back on the road there. We stopped and speak to some men. Oh, the driver told us they weren't men at all, but said they were corpses. - So, Christine. - Ah, Cristie. Alright, Cristie. I see you got references. That's good. If you don't mind me asking Mr Tovar, where did you get your mortuary training? Right here. On the job, with my daddy. I didn't really plan on anything. It just sort of work out that way. So you took over the family business here from your father? Yeah. Daddy worked with bodies with his daddy back in the Czech home town. Can't really pronounce the name. I'm the first Tovar born over here. And this is the only mortuary in Hinzmanville? Yeah. We got the corner of the market. One-stop shop. Look at the ... We can start you out as an apprentice, if you want the job. - I do, thank you! - Can you start today? - Sure, I can start right now. - Good. Things ain't fancy here, but they'll do. Of course, I'm gonna have to supervise your work at first. Of course. You also offer cremations here, don't you? You know ... We don't do too much of that. But we got an oven. I'll take you over to Aunt Lou. She'll tell you what your salary will be. Pay is low to start, but it's fair. Lou will get you a set of keys. Certain rooms are off limits for right now, so you won't have those. Thank you, Mr Tovar. Call me Gerald. That's your cold room. Follow me. - ... the men who steal these corpses. - Why do you drive like that you fool ... worse is that could have been. We might have been caught. DyeAnne ... I want you to meet Christine ... Cristie Forrest. Hi, I'm DyeAnne. Hi. Nice to meet you. Cristie. Diane? DyeAnne, with a Y and a E. DyeAnne here has been with us for about three months. She's still training. Not ready for embalming work just yet. You two can get to know each other as you work on Mr Hadley. I've got to go check on something. DyeAnne, you show Cristie where everything is. Okay. So once we wash the body, we massage the muscles. Makes it feel like more easy prep for embalming. I heard he took meths. OD'd. Well, they all get the same respect once they get to us. Go ahead and work on the bicep a little bit more. I know how to break with her. Oh, I'm sorry. Well wait. Gerald didn't tell me where you went to school. Junior still wants to say a goodbye to me. Junior? I don't even know why I plan this. I was told it sucks. You mean late nights, fresh calls? No! I love working alone. Late at night. For the rest of the time, during the day with people. Hey, Dye ... Oh, whoa. I am sorry. I thought you were DyeAnne. - No it's okay. I'm Cristie. - This is Cristie Forrest. The new assistant Funeral Director. You make it sound so formal. I just starting. That's nice to meet you. Have you seen Gerald around? I know where he is. - Ah so, later DyeAnne. - I'll text you. Nice to meet you, Cristie. - Aunt Lou? - The prodigal brother returns. Gerald. Harold. - Guess I'm supposed to be surprised. - Wow. You look different. Did you lose some weight? Well, I guess I'll leave you two boys alone. Especially you got a lot of catching up to do. Nice to see you again, Aunt Louise. So ... You kept locking the crematorium now? We got some issues in there. Guess we need to talk. Can I just add that, Gerta, it seems God poured his bucket of rich natural resources down here on the heartland so that .... and in the hands of the great down to earth patriots who value hard work - What's on the tube, Lou? - Oh, about Sister Sara. Sister Sara? Really? that has been forgotten on our own doorstep here. As we all know on ... - Did you talk to DyeAnne yet? - Not yet, Junior. You know I will. Can you turn that up? She is tremendous. ...patriotic Americans. Well Gerta, I of course, infuriate those who would say that because the former Vice President lacks a pulse in there that makes him as the main stream media is so very fond of saying one of the walking dead or a zombie, also. Do you smell it? - Smell what? - The whiff of cook. Just got a little stronger in here. - Aunt Lou, do you understand that woman? - T bonics. Okay, fine. You can laugh all you want. Mark my words, that woman is the face of the new movement. Become a teabagger, have you? You do know what "teabagging" is, don't you? That is an inappropriate term. Now Gerald ... Well, guess everyone loves their own kind of misery. America! ... here to tell 'em we're no longer listening. This is what happens when the Constitution starts shaking her fist. No one comes around here. It's off limits. He never touched this one! What? He ain't touched this shit. He hasn't touched this since he died. No. I come in here every now and then just to be by myself. Is it still in there? Daddy's broom handle? - That brings back some memories. - Daddy let you play with it, biddy? - Yeah. - Now, now Harold. This is not a toy. This is worse than money. I remember this too. Dad's old mini-fridge. Well, I don't think there's anything in there you want. Huh. You want to wet my whistle. I'm not picky. I'm just not buying. - What have we found? - Go ahead and take it. It's not diet. You're right. It's not. It's kind of ... but it's still good. You got that dull useless look about you, Harold. Look, it's nice to see you again too, Gerald. What brings you back? You're tired of treating the doggies and the kitty cats? No. No, I ... I closed the veterinary clinic. Oh? I had to. I need money, Gerald. Okay, Harold. No. No, no ... Real money. Well, little brother. You got all your money in tin foil if you think I got any money. No look, Gerald. You inherited the mortuary, the house, the real estate that it's sitting on not to mention the farmhouse. I need money. And I will challenge the will, if I have to. You gonna start that shit again, are you? I haven't seen you in ten years and you come in here ... You didn't even come to daddy's funeral. I was in a bad place. What makes you think I'd give a half Tovar like you any money, even if I had any? Damn it, Harold. I'm sorry. Listen, you caught me at a real bad time. We're still brothers and all. Nothing's changed there. Why don't you let me make it up to you. Come on down to the old place tonight, I'll fix you supper. We'll talk about it. You fix me supper? Unless you'd rather fish something out of that old mini-fridge. That's a close one. That settles it then. Be back here at 7 tonight. We'll drive out together. Alright, brother. Alright. Okay if I come in for a second? Well, you're kind of already in, Russ. What's on your mind? The door. It was only open for five minutes. I swear to God. I believe you, Russ. Listen, I got a lot on my mind lately. Oven room's broken, just hired a new girl. Work's backing up. You might have noticed a little odour creeping out. Yeah. Well, let's just keep that between you and me for now. You with me? Sure, ... but the crematorium ... Doesn't this work at all? Well, let's just say the fire doesn't work for me, Russ. - Okay. - Say Russell? You got a brother, works over at the Henry Cooper place, right? Oh yeah. That's my twin brother, Owen. He's kind of a slacker. He has like a ponytail. It's gross. Alright. Well. Why don't you go on and wash the cabbie. - And say Russ! - Yeah? Don't forget your keys. And stay out of that oven room until further notice, you got me? I got it. You got everything laid out. Disinfected? Yes, Mr Tovar. Smell like menthol. My special cologne just for you. It is always nice to look at the face of somebody God took a little extra time on. Too bad this ain't one of them. Alright, let's get down to it. You got all your tools here. You got your mouth formers in a box over there. That's your eye caps. Now if you run out or you can't get the eyes to close just right use superglue. All trick to the trade. - I did not know that. Closing mouth, I don't have one of them fancy injector guns, just good old fashion needle and string. I actually have my own injector gun. Well, that's fine, if you know how to use it. And by the looks of it, you do. Ahh, trocar. My daddy calls it the embalmer's spear. You always want to be careful when inserting a trocar, especially if the departed appears to be gassy. That's one more reason we wear our face shields. Oh yeah. I have something to attend to. - DyeAnne you help Cristie. Cristie, you go and set the features. I'll be right back. Come on! - Dad's T87? - Yup. - Get in. - What did you do? What didn't I do? That's daddy. Take your time. I'll be in the house. - You remember where the dining room is? - Yeah. Hello? Hey, Mr Tovar. Okay. Okay. Yes, we understand. Shit! What? Is that Gerald? Junior. Got tied up. Wants us to go ahead and embalm the body. We'll check your work later. I'm supposed to be your assistant. - Hello, ladies. - Hello. I think I knew this dude. Yeah, I bought grass from this guy once. What happened to him? I'm sure he died. Die with ... or what? - We gonna take care of this guy first. - Right now? You mean embalm Mr Hadley. I think wait around for a bit and come back. Oh no, I'm cool. I was on top of all this when Bobby was here. - Alright, but don't stay too close. - He's not going to bite. Yeah, it actually takes like a whole lot to make me sick. WHNZ news time 8 o'clock. In local news, for you fans of Sister Sara the new book tour make a stop tomorrow at the Hinzmanville Mall where she'll be signing her new book "Getting In There". Well, that's enough of that. Hope you don't mind drinking a beer with your eggs. Coffee would have been preferable. I'm out of coffee. There is not a whole lot else in the house. I'm sorry. For water running I get cold water. - Bottled water? - Just regular tap water. No! I never drink tap water. Afraid of what's in it? You think fluoride is the only thing they put in the water? Perfect paranoia, is perfect preparedness. Well, what suits you, don't usually suit me. That's the way it's been, ain't it? Yup. Something like that. So ... You really haven't done a thing with this house, have you? Look around, little brother. This is your million dollar show place! Just can't get pass it. Dad's death. Yes, I know. He's everywhere I look. I just wasn't ready for it. It's been 30 years in that place with him. Maybe it's better you just sell it, Gerald. Whatever in the house, just let it go. - It's like dad. - Live in the here and now. The here and now sitting in front of me, wants money. Demands money. But I don't much care. I got big problems. The oven in the crematorium? Just get it fixed. Ain't that simple. Give me that beer if you ain't gonna drink it. Well. I'm here now. Let your brother help. - You think you want to know my problems? - Absolutely. Like shit, I'll tell you. It was a good idea to take a break. I thought you'll chill up with like beer or something. This is a good idea. - This is good stuff. - Yeah. Zombies? I didn't call them that. You did. I don't know nothing about zombies. Okay. Wait. Let's get this straight. So you're telling me ... That there are corpses at the mortuary ... and they're moving ...? At the crematorium. Yeah, they're moving. Some of them are getting up. Okay. Alright. So, let me ask you. Do they move fast or do they move slow? Are they shamblers or are they sprinters? Well, they move real slow, Harold. They are dead. Romero zombies. Okay. Well. - I believe I will have that beer now. - No, no, no. I'll get it. You stay put. You have reached the law offices of Boyle, Snyder and Wright. If you know your party's extension, press it now. Hey Dan, it's Harold. Listen. I think I have what we need to deal with my brother. I want you to look into mental incompetence, and I will call you at the office in the morning. Thank you. Bye. Why didn't you say that you went to school there? I didn't. She's a necro. What? - What is that? - I like dead people. You mean ... like sex? Don't be silly. No, not like that. That is awesome! Jesus, Gerald! How could this have even gotten started? Daddy had a side business going for years. Government deal medical waste. Federal government? Daddy would accept stuff they didn't want to report. So, they rolled on in. He just burned whatever they brought along that paid him cash. Really? Shit storm started about a couple of weeks ago. That company delivered a real thick body bag. Okay. And? Well, I have heard about incidents like this, as a matter of fact. - Government. CRAC. - Crack? - This ain't about drugs, Harold. - No, no, no ... It is an anachronism, Gerald. Initials. C.R.A.C stands for ... Corpse Re-Animation Cover-up. Don't you read "The Grudge Report"? Cover-ups. Socialist-run internment camps. Area 51, that ring a bell to you? Jesus. And ... Zombie operation. Pittsburgh in 1968 and then '78. And Louisville in 1985 and again in Pittsburgh in 1990. They say that one is very similar to the outbreak in '68 only more gory. Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh. That is where it all started. According to the "Grudge Report" That city is the zombie capital of the world. And Hinzmanville is not that far away. How do you know so much about this shit? - From the internet, so it must be true. - Jesus, Harold. Even I know you can't believe everything you read on the internet. I mean, let me ask you something. Will you hear this about everything on the internet being true. On the internet? So, what? You think I'm a drunk or a crazy? Oh, no, no, no. - Yeah. - No. Well, I'll show you. Cristie? Hey, you okay, Cristie? - Are you okay? - I told you we should have told her. You've done E before, right? E? Ecstasy. Russell's second income. Hey. You cool, you cool .... You should chill out for a little bit. You don't believe me? We'll go over to the mortuary right now. Come on, Gerald, it's late! You've been drinking, you can't drive. - You can drive a stick shift, can't you? - Of course. Yes. Here you go. When we get over there we'll both sober up real quick. Alright fine. But we're stopping to get coffee. I want you at least a little sober so this isn't a total waste of time. Close that. Oh, my God! Oh, God! This. Put a dab under your nose. Oh, my God. Gerald! There must a hundred bodies in here. I figured you are a 2nd Amendment kind of guy. - I'll stick to my shovel. - A shotgun? You gave me a shotgun. What are we walking into here? You stay right behind me now. If you trying shock them on me, mission accomplished. - Be careful. That thing is loaded. - Right. Right. Oh, my God! Help me. Harold! What is this? You remember that Tea Bag or express bus accident? Happened a few days ago, you probably heard about it. I did. I had no idea they were brought here. Oh, no. These are good Americans. The guru, Dirk Ermey, was at the wheel. Drove them all right into a ditch. Oh no. They started coming back to life about two weeks ago. A few days before that, the company brought up this new protective light body bag. There was something real strange, real corrosive in that bag. Daddy accepted everything they brought in, put it in the fire real quick. But you didn't do that. There was something special in them. Gerald! What? Gerald, why didn't you just burn these bodies and get rid of them? - The fire. - What? You weren't around, so you wouldn't know. Daddy always handle the cremation himself. I couldn't even help him. I tried. But I never could. Okay, so you ... just took the bodies and the money. - This was never about money. - Okay. When daddy passed, I just kind of lost it for a couple of weeks, and a couple of weeks became a couple of months. And then you know, things just pile up on you. I guess I'm what some people call ... - ... procrastinator. - Right. Anyway, come on over here. What the ... ... fuck is this? Bobby Kimball. Why is he up there like that? Bobby's special. Like the son I never had. Worked with me here for years. When the time came, I was going to give everything to him. But that all got shot to shit when he got torn in half by an 18 wheeler. Like you see him now. But ... Why is he tied up like that? When the others came back, I figured ... Maybe if I tied him up, I can control him. - If he came back. - Gerald, he's dead. Back from the dead. See when they come back, they come back real slow. - Slow? - Umm. So slow, you can hardly notice it. I thought I was going crazy. And the I borrowed that video cam of my girl DyeAnne. Recorded all night. But the taping didn't see nothing. No movement. It wasn't until I accidentally hit the fast forward button, that I saw one of them move. So I had time to deal with my little corpse problem. I just had to keep an eye on things, get them under control. Late at night, I fired up the chainsaw and de-animate them. Gerald, that sounds like a good creepy story but you have to listen to yourself. You sound like a crazy person. And frankly all I see here ... are a bunch of mutilated bodies, that should have been burned or buried a long time ago. God damn it! I show you all this and you fucking don't believe me. Oh Gerald. Pick up the camera right over there. Come on, I'll show you. Battery is dead. We'll go to my office. I got more tapes in there. No, no, no. No! I'm done. I've had quite enough! It's been a long night. I'm going to my motel. Your shotgun. Jesus, Gerald! Shit! Never a god damned zombie around when you need one. Junior! Are you in here? Junior? Junior? - Aunt Lou? - Oh, Lord! What a stink! What are you doing here so late, dear? You shouldn't be in here. I forgot my purse. I was on the way back from the casino. I drove all the way out there for nothing. Can you imagine that? So anyway, I came back, and I thought I heard voices in here so I ... Junior ... What's going on in here? All these bodies like ... Aunt Lou! Aunt Lou! Oh, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. Now, come on here. Come on. Come on, dear. We gonna take care of you over here, well. We'll set you down on the old couch. Ah, you gonna be good as new. Lay on down here. There you go - Now, feeling better? - Oh, Junior. I don't understand Junior. I have bit real bad. What was that thing? Was this something like some sort of crazy person? Shouldn't we be going to a hospital? Why aren't we going to a hospital? I can't take you to a hospital Lou. I'm pretty sure they couldn't do anything for you anyway. And I sure as hell know they wouldn't understand. What understand? Are you saying that the thing killed me? Just lay your head back now. Close your eyes. Rest. I'll be back in a while. Then everything'll be ... just he way it's supposed to be. You get some rest now, Lou. Why is this all happening now, Dad? I tried to do everything just like you wanted. Aunt Lou? - Up here. - Gotcha. Oh, my. This is where you bring the deceased, Dee Dee? I told you it's DyeAnne. Well, I have to tell you, I'm not a big fan of being around the dead. Now about the living, making a difference. But I do want to thank you both for getting me a giving me a ride while the limo man waits for the um ... Ah, tow truck is the word that you're looking for. Do you have a Purell and a Diet Coke? - Excuse me, a Diet Coke? - Let me go check. Thanks honey, you're a sweetie. And a bendy straw. Oh, my God! There's something wrong with Aunt Lou! What's happening? Oh, fuck! Shit! Oh, no, no. Fuck. Fuck that! - Somebody help her! - Come with me. Here. Fuck that! God. What is she doing? What the hell's wrong with her? She looks like she's fucking dead. - I don't know! - Hey, hey, hey, get the fuck back! We've got to stop her! Russell! Here, use this! - Be careful! - You be careful. I'm a little busy right now! - Oh, Jesus Christ! - What the fuck? Oh, why the heck would that crazy lady in there attack me? Everybody likes me. Aunt Lou? No idea. It almost like seeing a movie of zombie. I mean that's what they look like. Well, I don't get it, DyeAnne, watch those kind of movies. Too morbid. Well, I'm kind of like, dizzy there. In the movies, they are like animals, yes? And they could eat brains. I'm sorry, what did you say there? About what the ghouls crave? Brains. Brains? Oh! - Oh, god. - Oh, Christ, DyeAnne! - What the hell is happening? - I don't see her anywhere. Crazy bitch killed her. Look, I don't know what's going on but we need to find her and we need to lock her up. The crematorium. I have the keys. It's got the strongest door. Whatever it is we can put it in there. That'll be the safest places. I've got to put a bunch of stiffs in there. Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on! It was meant to be. When he came back, I knew. You ... You ... dug Dad up? Daddy came back fast after I gave him the taste. Faster than the others. Some of them took days. You see, I knew there was a reason I wasn't supposed to burn them. He had it in his will to be cremated, but I didn't do it. I brought him up here to be with me. And now he's back. You dug dad up and you gave him some of that fluid from the bank? Life's blood. - Dad, it's Harold. - I wouldn't get too close. Gerald ... I didn't before, but I believe you now. - Seeing is believing, Harold. - But it doesn't solve your problem! What are you going to do with all the others at the mortuary? This is serious, Gerald. People are in danger. What about Aunt Lou? She's family! No. She got bitten. - Pretty sure she's zombiefied by now. - What? Gerald! My, God! What have you done? What are we going to do? I brought daddy back, Harold. Right now, everything else is kind of foggy. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Clear heads prevail. Okay. I think that we can keep the authorities out of this and we won't burn them, Gerald. But we've got to keep that crematorium locked. Do you understand me? Locked and locked tight. And then ... We go green. - What are you talking about, Harold? Maggots! Maggots, Gerald. I know where I can get a lot of maggots! I will help you. I will help you. But not for free. I have to get something in return. Daddy old briefcase. And there's $30,000 in there. That's all I got. That's a start but it's not enough. What do you want? Gerald, what do you know about tissue harvesting? Human body is worth $200,000 when it's divided up and sold to companies who buy human tissue. Here's the beauty. You get rid of your problem, and you go into the tissue harvesting business with me. Tissue harvesting? Yes, the maggots get rid of the bodies that are too far gone ... ... and we take what we want from the rest, and the new clients who come up. Bones, Gerald are very valuable. Before the funeral, we are going to have to replace the bones with ... Now ... just thinking of the top ... PVC pipe. Whose gotta know? And you want to do that out of my mortuary? Sure, chump. That's a question! I want no part in disrespecting the dead. Gerald! That's what you have been doing! Protecting daddy's legacy is what I'm doing! I'm no grave robbing tissue grabber! Poppa! Well little brother, you won't be coming back again. I'd like to help you, but I'm afraid there's no cure for that bite. This is a good spot for you. With family. At home. Gerald, pick up! DyeAnne. Cristie? Now is not a good time. What? Oh Jesus. Calm down. Calm down. Alright. Listen, stay put. I'll be there as quick as I can. Look here, Cristie, I know this probably ain't the right time. But there ain't no right time. - We got to deal with DyeAnne. - What do you mean? - She's coming back. - She's coming back? Like Aunt Lou? Yeah, like that. When you called, you said you and Russ were attacked by some frothing at the mouth crazy bitch, right? Well, same thing is going to happen to her. What you gonna do? This ain't DyeAnne any more. I want you to get out of here and go on in the other room. Don't come back. Go on. Holy hell. - She didn't deserve that. - We have to go get Russell. Get Russel. I though you said he got pulled into the oven room. He's dead. We don't know that he's dead. Don't you even care? Of course I care. Russel didn't deserved it either. Don't you want to even try? If I thought there was half a chance, you know, I'd go in there and get him. You think there's a chance? - Ever used a gun? - No. Well, you pull the trigger. Alright. We are gonna go into the back here. I'm thinking most of them will be up near the front where they grabbed Russ. - Why did you have this cage installed? - For security. Why would have a metal cage in front of the back door of a crematorium? - Keep your voice down. - What happened here? That's gonna have to be a story for another time. Let's just go get Russ. Stay right beside me. - Oh Jesus! - Stay focused on what's ahead. Breathe through your mouth if you can. Use that and make sure you aim for the forehead. Oh, God! - I don't see Russell. - Me neither. - Gerald. - Oh, God. That's him? - He's still alive. - Cristie, that ain't him. - He's just a corpse in Russell's. - What? He'd been dead for too long. You can tell by the corpse. Seems like his mind is trying to, hang on but that ain't Russ. Another word here, I can't watch him like that. What you gonna do? Open each one. Then we gonna get the hell out of here. Gerald, look! Cristie shoot that thing! Shoot her! Cristie! Cristie! Cristie, where are you? Get off, get off me ... Now. Shit. God damn it, Bobby! Get off of her! Get out of here, Cristie! Go on. I'll be right behind you! Come on inside. I'll fix you up. Come on. Here you are. Gonna sit you down. You're in shock, Cristie. You need to get some fluids in you. Thank you, Gerald. Here you go. Drink this. It's warm and it may not taste so good. But it'll do the trick. - What is it? - It's one of them energy drinks. - Red Bull or Monster? - Something like that. Go on, drink it. It will make you feel like a new woman, I promise. What did you give me? You poisoned me! Not poison, Cristie. Life's blood. - You'll see. - No! You're special. Wasn't no accident you came here to me. I can see that now. When you come back, I'll take care of you. Don't you worry now. I'll be right back.
