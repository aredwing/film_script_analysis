It's one thing being daring on site and all but you need to sort out if you're beating up our boys or the other side. The poor boys feel bad enough as it is beating people up for money. How do you think they feel about getting beaten up by the same side? Why is mine so thin? Is it a fucking love letter? I'm asking you why it's so thin, you fucking cunt. You cunt, check the contents before you kick up a fuss. Think before you open that trap of yours, you bastard. Like I'm going to treat the boys the same way I treat you? And you bastard! however close friends we are, I am four years older than you. Show some respect, at the very least, in front of the boys. It's not like your dick is going to get chopped off if you do. Fucking bastard. Who asked you to write me a check? Cunt. Yeah, it's all my fault. Hey! Hey, bastard! This is what you call money, what you live on. The bastard doesn't hear what l'm saying. Do you want a smack? Aren't you going to take it? Huh? Just stuff it, bastard.

You stupid bitch. I see you're alive. I thought you were dead. What do you think you're doing, laying your hands on an elder? Bitch. Go and die. I wiped it off. Go off home and ask mummy to make you dinner. Go home and study. As you got smacked in the trap, if it hurts bill me for medical expenses. Hey! Pay me the medical expenses then! Aren't you drinking up? Crazy bastard! I'm like this cos you hit me. Fucker. This little runt! Look at the way she talks. What the fuck you staring at? You into faceology or what? I can see your trap's one big fat sewer. Crazy son of a bitch. Hey, drink up! So we can get out of here. He finishes his own drink and wants to piss off. Hey! Isn't this a bit cheap as medical compensation? Give me your number. Wow, the cunt is a big bully. Are you a big hit at school? What year are you in anyway, bitch? Third grade. Why? Did you even go to school? You asshole? I'll call your pager. If you don't answer I'm going straight to the police! I'll report you as a violent attacker. But what's with the pager, anyway? It's not the stone ages you know. Aren't you gonna greet an elder properly? After stuffing your face with beer. Look who's fucking around. You cunt! Here! Please... would you stop hitting them? Not one of them hasn't been hit by you. Hey! Including me, there are 9 of us working together. If even one of us drops out. Are you going to deal with all those fuckers on your own? I'm asking you a favor. Stop beating them up, okay? And don't spend all the money on gambling. Alright, I get it, you wanker. Has your dad been released? A month ago. Thank you for reminding me of the asshole. Go give him some spending money, eh? You give some to him. Is it funny, you fucking prick? You haven't had a beating lately, have you, motherfucker. You like it, huh? Is it funny, you fucking prick? You bastard, you're dead meat, you. Get over here, you fuckhead. You bastard... Hey, let go. Try letting go, you bastard. Hey, let go, you idiot! Let go, okay, you bastard? You bastard... Look at the expression on the bastard's face. Little cunt. Hey, bastard. Give this to your mother. - If she asks who gave it to you... - Mum! Oh, fuck. Sang Hoon! Sang Hoon, stay for dinner and play a bit more with Hyung In. And... put this away. - Your sister's also earning money. - Hey, bitch. Who's my sister? Do you know my mum? Fucking cunt. - Don't swear at my mum! - Hyung In. Is that your wife? Oh... even gangsters have family. Piss off. Drop dead. Why did you fucking ignore my message?

Sang Hoon! Stop him. If he goes on like that, he'll kill her. Stop him, Sang Hoon. Mum's going to die! I said leave it! I'm afraid she was dead on arrival. Hey! How can you sleep at night, after beating people to a pulp like that? You've even killed before, haven't you? Shut it, okay? Hey! You can follow me around and pay for me, for ignoring my call and for this hiding place. Got it? Come with me. The crazy bitch is fucking around. What time do you think it is? Look at the time, and dinner's not even ready. You know your old dad starts losing it when you come in late. I'm about to cook. Can't you see I've been grocery shopping? Give me 10,000 won. What happened to the 20,000 I gave you in the morning? Cunt! What do you think 20,000 is worth? I ordered some Chinese and that was it. Hurry up and give it to me. You took 50,000 from my wallet without asking the day before yesterday. Well, I thought I could help myself, seeing as you left it lying around. But it's not like it's your money. Why are you getting fucking worked up, like it's your own money? Fucking bitch. Well, it's not your money. Then you take care of the house with that money. You can do all the grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning, and get accused of being a thieving bitch by dad. Shut it, fucking bitch. Are you losing it cos you want to die? Cunt. Give me the money while I'm asking you nicely, fucking cunt. Otherwise I'm going to tear your panties to pieces. Fucking cunt. Eat. Aww, my daughter's made dinner for me. Your mother's lost her mind meeting other men, but my daughter's a good girl. My girl. Have you seen my bank book? I can't find it in the drawer or in the closet. Your mother hasn't run off with it again, has she? I earned that money getting shot by bullets in Vietnam. Your mother hasn't spent it all on other men, has she? Dad, you left your bank book with me, remember? You told me to do the housekeeping. As it's all under control, don't worry. Eat your dinner. Is that so? Okay, you take care of the housekeeping. What did you put in the food? You put rat poison in it, didn't you? You put rat poison in it to kill your old man, didn't you? Fucking bitch. Trying to kill your old man off with rat poison cos he's incompetent and good for nothing eh? What would I put in the food? I cooked it with the groceries I just bought. Why would I want to kill you, dad? Stop picking faults and eat up. Eat up? Ha! You mean hurry and eat up the rat poison and die? You fucking bitch, opening up your cunt to fuckers. You're just like you're mother. Go and find your mum! Off you go! Go get her! Where do you think she is? She's dead. Don't you remember? Go find your mum! Go get her. I haven't seen her in a while. Do I need to go search? Hey have you not found it yet? No. I think we're near, but there are so many houses here. We're only taking all fucking day, cockhead. You a high schooler? No, I graduated. The fucking cockhead's playing games. Fuck. This is it. That didn't take you long, did it now, you wanker. Hey! Open the door! Fucking asshole. You fucking wanker, it's cos you took so long finding it. Hey, let's go. Fucking prick. Son of a bitch! Cos you made those fucking dog noises, you got found, ain't that right? Son of a bitch. Hey! How much is it for this son of a bitch? You heard that right? Hand it over now. I'll be able to pay it back if you give me ten days. What you fucking playing at, you fucking cock? You thinking of doing a runner? Work us harder, eh? Do you know what it's like to get up at 4:30 and go around collecting money? Because of you, I had to get up at 4:30. But, why the hell are you missing out the 'please'. Don't you know how to pronounce the word? It's not that... We have a lot more places to stop by. So, you've got ten seconds to decide. You get to decide if we turn into saints or devils in ten seconds. Got it? That's two seconds gone. You motherfucker! He said ten seconds, you fucker. Fuck! It hasn't even been eight seconds. Eight! How many houses left? Six. Make sure you collect it properly. Got it. Here... Oi! Hurry up and stuff it down your trap. Earlier on you looked like you could kill someone. Now you aren't so tough eh? You high schooler bastard. - Hey! - Yes. Finish up and come out. You a high school kid? Fucking cunt. Take the children outside. What's this. You bastard, eh? I'm your dad, you fucking bastard. The fucker who goes round beating people to a pulp. He thinks he'll never get it himself. But there's gonna be a day when the fucker gets fucking beaten to a pulp too. But that day's fucking today and the guy doing the beating is a fucking cunt. There's even an audience. So I'm saying if you borrowed something, pay it back. Why you putting it off? Making bastards like me come and visit. I'm sorry, I'm wrong. Let me offjust the once. The fucking fathers of this country are all such cunts. He's a fucking fool but when it comes to his family, he's Mr. Kim ll Sung. You Kim II Sung? You fucker. You Kim II Sung? Eh? Fucking shithead? Son of a bitch! Eh? - You bastard. - Stop. Please stop. Boss! I'm here. Ohh, you're early? Fucking bastard. I woke up at 4:30. You fucking around? Hey, cunt. We have newbies here. You gonna show such disrespect for the boss? What they gonna learn? What have you taught them? Teach my ass. They do fine without any teaching. Oh? Wow. Who would've thought I'd see the day Kim Sang Hoon gives out compliments. Well done. But... Aren't you a high schooler? I graduated. Did you? Okay. Hand me the collected funds. How much is there? Woohoo... you managed to collect a lot. The two of you are a match made in heaven. And this is the change from the Chinese food, taxi ride and snacks for the boys. That's fine. Don't worry about it. Normally you'd get your pay monthly. But seeing that you came out at daybreak and worked your fucking ass off. - Here, take this. - Thank you. Hey! You don't need the money now, do you, Kim Sang Hoon? Hey. Let's go for a drink. Hey! I want to have another drink, but seeing as you guys were out all day working your asses off. Go home and get some rest. I bet you're tired. Let's go for a drink next time. Round up all the family and go someplace nice. Put out the pussies like this. Good idea, isn't it? - Hwan Gyu. Innit, Hwan Gyu? - Sure. Hwan Gyu, you go ahead. Sang Hoon and I need to talk. - Then I'll be off then. - Alright now. Thank you. Off you go. That bastard's quick. Cute, isn't it? Then live with him. Bastard. I don't like assholes, bastard. If you've got something to say, say it now. So I can get going. Fucker. Yeah, got something to say. How's your old man doing? Take this to him, eh? It's not like he knows how to do anything. Do you think he's even eating properly? I'll pass it on to him today. Tell him it's from the president of his fan club. I'm off. Hey! For orphan bastards like me. Even having a dad like that would be swell. Fucker. You having a drink, fucker? Your fan told me to pass this onto you. Lucky you! There's a bastard out there who gives you money. Have a drink. Did you lace it with rat poison, knowing I was coming? Drink. Drink! Drink. Drink!! Drink. If you're gonna take a good beating, then you better make sure your stomach's full, eh? Sorry.

Do you want me to buy it or not? That Play whatever. If you don't want it, say no and if you want it, say yes. The cat got your tongue? This bastard is really frustrating.

You cunt, are you here to play? You here to play? Fucking cunt. Huh? Why are you holding back? Fucking cunt! I'll bring it over, I will bring it. Hwan Gyu, this wanker's gotten too fucking big for his boots. - I'm sorry. - Shit, you fucking cunt. You fucker. You cunt. I said, are you here to play? You cunt? Have you gone deaf? Cunt? If you don't cough up the money today then count yourself dead, fucker. I'll pay it. I'll pay it right now. You, Young Jae, get over here. Raise your head. Look at me, you fucking bastard. You here to play? Are you? Don't roll your fucking eyeballs, cunt. You think you're that good at fights, huh? You think you're that clever, huh? Hold back and even clever fuckers who are good at fighting are dead meat. I want to kill all the fuckers who are hesitant wimps. You have to do it with action, if you don't want to die. You got it, fucking retards? Don't get all sentimental. Got it. Is that the loudest your voice gets? Hwan Gyu, you get over here. Yes. Take this bastard with you and head back to the office first. What about you? I'll be right behind you. Go on now. Fucking son of a bitch, bastard. You alright? Where've you been? Have you been hitting the boys? Quit beating them up. He hasn't been with us for that long. Did I beat you up? Fucking pricks? No, you didn't. See, I didn't beat them, cunt. Whew! How much did you beat them for them to.. - Hey Young Jae! - Yes. You can follow Hong Seok's team tomorrow. You need to get to know some of the other guys too. Huh? Okay, got it. You can go around with Hwan Gyu, just the two of you, from tomorrow. What's with the change? Fuck. Just leave it the way it is. Okay then, bastard. Instead, make sure you don't beat the boys up, huh? Have you set up an account? Why are there two? Take turns paying into each one. Shit, what a hassle. You can arrange a standing order. If it's too much hassle cunt then get someone else to do it. Phew. Alright. I'll do it. Bloody fucking hassle. Hey. Hold off on the gambling and get yourself a cell phone. I quit gambling. Cunt. Welcome. Oh! Hello. - Where's she gone? - You mean Hyun Seo? She worked until 12 today and went home early. I think she mentioned that something came up at home. Is there something I can help you with? My cell phone should be here somewhere. The one you bought last time? Hyun Seo took it with her. Said she's give it to you herself. Have you not gotten it yet? - I'll give her a call. - Leave it. I can make the call... - Thank you. - Alright, eat up now. Thank you. Welcome! You fucking cunt. Get your ass home as soon as you can. Hey, fucking bitch! You know the idiot starts losing it if you come home late. Fucking bitch. You don't get any studying or shit done. I started a part-time job today. I'll be home around this time every day from now on. You fucking around, cunt. You concentrate on the housework, eh? I'll bring the money back. I didn't ask you this, but where is the money coming from? It's not even small money Fucking cunt. You still complaining when I bring money home? Why, do you feel dirty - cos it's like that money's dodgy stuff? - Yeah. The money's probably earned by beating people to a pulp. It makes me feel dirty. Even doing labor work all day long only pays you 40-50. Where does all that big money come from? You know, it makes me so uneasy I want to chuck it away. Shit, you fucking bitch. Go throw it away then, cunt. Hey! Burn it. Or, even tear it up. Fucking cunt. You tramp. What you staring at? I'm going to kill you, you fucking cunt. Sang Hoon. Stop thinking like that. Think how hard it must be for your dad. He paid for his sins by serving time in jail. Paid for his sins? Is there a price to pay for murdering someone? Cunt? You kill someone and then spend Does that mean you've paid for it? Fucking cunt! Alright, now keep it down. Be quiet. What the fuck you staring at, you fucking cunt? - What's your fucking problem? - Stop it, hey! You said to me before, right? Orphan bastards like you would like to have a dad. But you know what? Bastards like me would rather be an orphan. Prick! The fucking bastards are fucking rowdy. Oi, keep it down, eh, fucking wankers. Let me kill a fucking cunt today and see if I can repent my sins. Hey! I'm going to kill you! Where's your mother gone, leaving her daughter to cook dinner. Fucking whore. She neglects her family, doesn't even cook. Where has she fucked off to? Your mother. I told you, mum's not around. Bitch. Why isn't your mum around? I said, she's dead. Bitch. Why is your mum dead? She's fucking about, opening that pussy of hers. Why would she be dead? You rotten bitch. I said, mum's dead. She's dead! How many times do I have to tell you? Why don't you get it? I said, mum's dead! She's been dead for years already. Why do you keep bringing it up? Why? I'm going to kill you, you fucking cunt. I'm really going to kill you. Come here. Come over here. What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? Aren't you going to put it down? Don't do it. I said, don't do it. Why are you being like this? Why? You fucking cunt. Cunt. Wake up. Wake up! What the fuck is this. You cunt! What am I! What? Open the door. Open the door. Don't die. Even though it's too hard living and you just want to die, you've gotta live. If you die now, I'm... I'm... Live. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die! Mum... Okay, get ready for the blood transfusion. Take my blood and give it to him! Are you his son? As I'm his son, I'm asking you to take my blood and give it to him! I'm sorry. I said I'm his son, so take my blood! Fuck. I said, don't leave a single drop and just give it all to him. Take my blood and give it to him. - Get off him! - Take it! I said, give my blood to him. Give it to him! What you doing? I was about to sleep. You woke me up. Sorry for calling so late. Sleep. How come you're calling? Let's go for a beer. Forget it. - Let's do it next time. - I'll go now. Where should I go? If I'm here, at least look at me. Stop acting cool. What's this? I thought we'd go to a pub a drink. Sometimes you need to try drinking in places like this, bitch. It's really been a long time since I've been here. And at this time of night. I used to ride my motorbike here all the time, in middle school. So you were a bad boy from then on? You know, you're acting really weird today. Why do you look so lifeless? I gave blood before coming here, that's why. Gave blood? You? Why? Am I not allowed to give blood? Oh, right. I started a part-time job. In a snack bar. Isn't that funny? It's your shout on pay day. The wages are paid weekly. As I'll give you a call very soon, you can let this high schooler treat you. But, you really are mean. You ignore my calls when I page you, and only call me when you feel like it. Don't live like that. So how should I live? You tell me, high school kid. Do you want me to tell you? First of all... You should spend lots of money on me. Then you'll live a good life. Stupid high schooler. The little runt's fucking around. You can talk, scum bag. Who's messing around now? Let me lie on your lap. Don't bother asking. Are your parents living a good life? Of course. Be nice to them. Don't upset them. You be nice to yours. Stop being a scum bag. They're probably really upset cos of you. Hey! What? Why, you want to pick a fight? I got my wages from my part-time job yesterday. You don't listen, do you. Come on then. Attack! What? Oi, bastard. Little bastards. You're dead, you little bastard. You little bastard. Get up! How dare are you! You evil person. Why are you trying to kill? Bastards! Get over here, little bastards. Get over here, little bastards. Bastards! I'm off. See you next time. Hyung In. I'm sorry I did what I did last time. I shouldn't of. Don't beat grandad! Grandad's nice, why do you beat him? Dad used to... used to beat mum like that. There's a brewery. All the grains from that neighborhood go into that brewery... Who is that? Switch it off, okay? Who is it? I'm in class. It's me. I thought you said you'd treat on pay day. Huh? I was going to call. You can treat Hyung In today. He's in a play at kindergarten. Huh? Come out of exit 2 at Daelim Station and you'll find Omji Kindergarten. See you there at 5. Okay, I got it. Don't be late. I'll get off work early tonight. I got myself a cell phone. I'll give you the number when I see you. Hey, tell me now. He says what he wants to say and hangs up. What are you doing, fucking cunt! What's with you? I told you to get here by 1 1am. It's half-nine, prick. I know, wanker. So the bastard knows he's early? That's a surprise. Why, what's up? Do you need money? Fucking cunt. Is that all you can think about. You come to fuck me up while the boys aren't here, fucker? Fucker. However much I give it out, I ain't giving it to fuckers like you. Carry on with the cleaning. Fucking bastard. What is it then? Man Sik... What, you cunt. Man Sik... Oi, you fucking cunt. Spit it out. I'm calling it a day after today. Hey, you've thought it through carefully, have you? I don't know, bastard. Hey, it's not like I don't know you. Eh? It's just really sudden, that's all. I don't know... I'm just sick and tired of it all. And who enjoys it? Who the hell is in this line of work cos they enjoy it? Man Sik... What? Fuck. Bastard. Fuck. I'm through with it too. I'm quitting as well! Fucker. Fuck. I was going to pass all this onto Hong Seok anyway. The bastard. I'll just go ahead with the hand over procedures when the bastard gets here. Crazy bastard, stop fucking around. Stop trying to copy me, cunt. Who says they're copying you? Crazy bastard. If one of the founding member's gonna quit, then we're fucked anyway. I'm quitting. I'm all ready to open up a barbecue restaurant. And you have quite a bit of severance pay stacked up. Fucking cunt, really. You've been fucking hiding all this crap from the boys. That's right, you fucker. I am the boss, I need to watch out for myself more than the boys. But it's not like... I didn't give them their cuts. Alright. Get here quickly after you finish. Let's go for a drink. Fucker... all this so suddenly. Fucker... damn. Hwan Gyu called and said he wouldn't be coming in today. Work with Young Jae, yeah? My nephew's in a play today. Come along and we'll go for a drink afterwards. There's someone I want you to meet. Your nephew? The little runt must've grown a lot by now. But who you going to introduce me to? See for yourself later, you fucker. Fuck. I'll go straight to the kindergarten after work. See you there. Got it. Let's have some coffee. This looks like it. Sang Hoon, take your sister inside. Let's go. So, you know why we're here. Give us what we came for. We're busy. I've got some money coming in next week. I'll definitely pay you then. Hey, don't fuck aorund with me, cunt. Do you have money in the bank? Go put on a jacket and come with us. We'll be waiting outside. I really don't have it on me now. If you could just give me one week... I will definitely... Just this once... I really don't have it! I don't fucking have it, for fuck's sake! What do you expect me to do? Son of a bitch! Cunt! Don't! Don't hit him. Don't! - Don't hit him. - Don't! - Oi - Don't hit him. - Stop, Han Young Jae! - Fuck... I told you to stop, you bastard! Stop! Let go of that and get over here. I said, stop. Didn't you hear me? Forget this house, let's go. Fucking cunt! - Don't do that! - Oi! Hey, stop. Stop, you cunt, stop! Stop! Don't hit my dad! Fucker! You are really one big fucker. You cunt. This is what happens when you do what you haven't been told. Fucking retarded bastard. Let's get going. I need to go early today. Come on, bastard. Shit, come on, you bastard. Let's leave it here for today, yeah? My head's killing me. Hey, cunt, come on. Do you have any tissue? Sang Hoon... I do have it, you fucker. Son of a bitch, son of a bitch! Cunt! Why did you hold back? Why? Why? Why? Why? Cunt, why hold back? Why! Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Son of a bitch. Why? Why? Why? You fucker. And you told me not to hold back? You cunt. Cunt!

I work with Sang Hoon. He told me to come along today, saying his nephew's in a play. Oh, is that so? Sang Hoon's never once mentioned his work before. - Sorry I didn't know who you were. - No... not at all. Oh, this is Yeon Hee. Sang Hoon's friend. Oh, hello there. Sang Hoon never told me he had a friend who was in high school. Is he not here yet? I know... he told me he'd be on his way when we spoke on the phone a bit earlier. The idiot. Let's go in first, then. He'll make his way in when he arrives. Alright. This is the question Ji Young kept getting wrong. You're the only one who got this wrong. Sorry sir.
