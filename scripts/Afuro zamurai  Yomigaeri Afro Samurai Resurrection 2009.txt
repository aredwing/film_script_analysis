I have no choice. My father must rest in peace. Can we just leave -- alone? Only the blade is clean now,my brother. The rest is up to you. Afro has began to move. Keep your eyes on him. We don't gotta do this,you know! Come on, maybe you just have to chill. Change the state of mind, pick up a sport or somethin'. Hold up,hold up,hold up!! Wait a minute! You know I just realised..this is the first time I'm seeing you without No.2 headband. And you know what? You look kinda funny. It's weird man,I knew something was odd. I mean,your forehead is huge,bro! I thought your hair was big, but daaamn! That's a four times, four times, forehead. That's what they mean when they say headquarters. You're a big headliner,a headmaster,a... Shut up! Hey,were 've going? Is it true? He's heading this way? Yeah,it's him. I can't forget those eyes and hair. The cursed creature who cut down my Shumi. The demon who slaughtered those we love. We can't let this opportunity passes by. Revenge will be ours. He is coming! Afro Samurai is coming! Yo Afro. You might need this. You murdered my father. You murdered him! You killed my only brother! And my best friend! This is for my dead son! A curse on you demon! You will burn in hell! You will drown in a blood of those innocents you have slayed! You will suffer the -- blades of all of us, even after death! Curse on you, Afro Samurai! Oh snap!Now this is more like it! Yo man! Let me hold some gals. THe Afro Samurai is here. Send him in, won't you. OK,yeah!Here's the plan, You do something and... I'm gonna lap dance, and meet you in 5 minutes. WHOO!!! Hold up,let's get in! Oyideyassu. The No.2 headband! I am afraid, I can not give you the location of the No2 headband for free. But if you can defeat me.. OH,no, no, no!Not by a sword. We play...these. If you win, I'll tell where to find the No.2. If I win, I have your head. Do we have a deal? Escort Mr Afro to the gambling area. Unlike you brother Wong, I only play games that I know I'll win. Now, that was off the chizzin'! Yo Afro,I got 2 for one dance man. I was ... Wow,wow,wow..Hey,what I missed? Oh, we're gambling now? Cool! Let us start the game. Play the black. Ooops!Wrong game. Call! Odd. Even. Double ones,even. Afro Samurai, now that you lost fair and square... I must ask you to fulfill your... Fair? That cheatin'son of a bitch! I want free lap dances behind that. The No.2 headband! The No.2 is a ronin named Shichikoro. He is in the village called Machisiri,to the west . Man,couldn't we stayed a few minutes longer in that gambling house? This shit is boring,man! You're boring! The very demon of revenge, seeks divine guidance?! HAH!! Do you really think you can apsolve yourself of sin.. by sculpting stupid lil' toys? Now,that's some shit don't see every day! Where is the cold-blooded killer, you once were? Do you no longer have the stomach to fight? Well you remain a coward, even as your father suffers? Oh now,that's just ain't nice. You have to listen to that shit? And you have such a long,long way to go... to save your poor tortured father. I've almost revived his rotten bones. Oh,he will live again! To feel pain,to suffer. And you don't even have the No.2 headband yet. So, I have a few more days or maybe even weeks... to enjoy your father's pain, before you even have the right to challenge me. Watch your damned mouth... 'cause I am comin' for my Dad! Damn!We are comin'to get you bitch! You are weak my head love. Now the fun begins. She don't know who she's messin' with. Jinno. At last he's become to move. All's proceeding to plan. You will have your revenge. But to succeed,you and I my love, will walk the path of demons. I'm truly sorry... but this is the only way to make him feel the eternal sadness.. that we have felt. To make him suffer,as we have suffered. So,please,forgive me. Just remember that there was no alternative. I will always love you. My beloved brother. Your luck sucks man. Everybody know this is a first day at a year liberate round here. You ain't get no info of these party people 'bout No.2 headband. His name was Shichigoro, right? You even ain't got any idea what he look like,I don't. How we even gonna know that's his real damn name? Help! Help! Out of my way! Wha'? A kidnapping in the broad daylight?! That's a damn shame! Ah, shit! Afro Samurai. Out of my way! No damn! I said move you son of a bitch! Gun Afro, gun! Hit the rascal -- ! Kotaro! Oh daddy! Kotaro,I told you to stay close. I'm sorry. You,you have my thanx! This coward kidnapped my boy... Forget it. Let me buy you a drink. I know a spot nearby. Afro I think I lost a ninja boot. Wait,I am drownin'! Hey Afro! Don't leave a brother! I'm home, old man. Hey,you brought a friend today. This man saved Kotaro's life. So maybe he's strong enough, not to die from your stew old man. Watch your mouth when you talk about my stew Shichigoro,you might find a hot pepper in your bowl. Hey,I'm back! Where was you two? You're gettin' your grub on? UUUH...Something smells funky! Oh shit that's to do! What do we have partner? Sukiyaki. Double then! Cheers to you. Oh not a drinker,huh? You don't know what you're missin'. Lemonade then? Kidding,kidding! You aren't here for the festival,are ya? Me neither. Just passing through. But I guess we've stayed a bit. We had our chuckles at the festival. But it's best we move on. You know,it sucks you've gotta kill this dude. I gotta say,he ain't so bad.And cool! It's always lonely after the festival. At least,this is the last time I'll have to eat your lousy rat poison. You'll be sorry. I make the best stew for miles around. When you come back, remind me to charge you double. JEESUS!! This is the best?! Afro,maybe I kill Martha Stewart here too for lyin'. This stew sucks! Lemonade.Please help yourself! That guy earlier. The man you cut down. You wanna know why he tried to kidnap Kitaro? Hell no! You wanna know why anyone bothers with a street kid and a drunk like me? Shichigoro! It's OK old man. OK,tell us. I've got something everybody wants. One minute he's stuffing his face, the next he's passed out. He ain't even mine,he's an orphan. Son of a pal got himself murdered. I promised to watch him if he ever got in trouble and killed. Me and that old bastard, We were like brothers. I heard a man who killed him had a wierd look. An afro hairdo with a greenish tint, if you looked real close. Now you listen to me,and listen good. In this world there are bonds,deeper than blood. What? My pal that dumb son of a bitch, he was like so many fools,went after those headbands of legend. All he wound up was his death. You know what he said to me when I found him dying? "No more," he whispered. So, I got that No.2 headband myself and I hid it. And I'm around ever since. But now you've come. Now we're even. So,let's get this over with. OOOO...Damn!! It's all now ,no more Mr Nice bro'. Shichigoro! Keep that poison hot old man, I'll be back in a flash. I thought if Kitaro and me just kept moving, maybe folks would forget about it all about my pal's wish...and peace for his son. But I guess,there's no hiding from a fate. Damned. All these damn headbands do is make dead bodies and orphans. Do you hear me,Afro? Dead bodies and orphans. So,I ain't giving you the No.2 headband, you'll have to kill me to get it! Not because I'm playin' by headband rules, not because I'm at to save the world either. Yo,Afro! Wassup with the formal stance? I mean,he is cool, but he ain't your pal. Just dead this fool! It's because I keep my promises. Don't think I don't know you Afro Samurai. I saw what you did on a boardwalk. Killing a man without a moment of hesitation. Like he was nothin' but a fly on your face. Maybe it's time someone swatted you. Maybe I feel like I'm the guy to do it. You won't let him talk all that trash! Slice him,dice him Afro! Sayonara, Afro Samurai! Now that's just whack!You're gonna die,pretty! Oh,shit! This guy's slick. I'm impressed! He just might kill your ass! Oh man, you're runnin'? You're makin'us look bad,dude! Where you're goin'? OOOH...I knew you'd be --divious. We never run from nobody! We do not learn it now. Hey man,keep on swingin while I have my groove on! Let's party! OOOH shit! Everybody like rock stars. Lightshow,a lightshow,MHHHM,MHHHHM!!! Bring in,baby. "DESTROY ALL AFROSAMURAIS" YEAH...boom,boom! Yo look out for this party tracker now. On the stage,you've got the man with a No.2 headband! Do not stop ...get it,get it!!! Hey where do they come from? Dad? Kotaro?! OOW MAN! You killed the music! Why you always gotta wreck the party? Well!That was an unnecessary distraction. You still wanna die? You want it that much. It is just a piece of cloth, you idiot. If you're feelin' so lucky, come and get it! What the ...? Summenarae. Man,you always got to bust up the fun,don't you. I was raving until the break of dawn,man. Like tits and -- thing.. Why you gonna ruin it. That they've even cancelled the damn thing next year,and it's all your fault. And another thing! You ain't all that just 'cause you're back to be in No.2 again! Don't you get it!We're walking the demon path again. It ain't the right way. AHHH...Well, whatever. So where we goin' next? How about gettin' a lil' push-push first,know what I'm sayin'? Man we'll never party. Damn. That was kinda jump off . WHOO...!!Didn't they already kicked your ass? They come at you again. Your blade stains the world with blood. Oh ya, then? You kill only for your selfish petty reasons. Have you no heart? WOW!! This can't be real man. Who the hell are these people! This ain't possible! I don't think so! You should restrain yourself or risk another humiliating beating. You don't want to risk breaking my new toy,do you? He is so fragile,right now. Go to the Cherry Hill, or he dies again. But this time, much,much, much.. more slowly. Watch your damn mouth! Ben! My lady, step back. Damn. You allright man? NO! Jinno! Hey,easy little sis'! It's been a long time,hasn't it Sio? How you been princess? Good. And our foster parents,how are they? OH,they've been great! They are like real parents. And they got this kind of Bin-san, he's kinda -- scared. And other guy Michael-san he plays with me a lots! Oh,oh..and there's this lady Tomo-san, she teaches me to be the real princess. I even learned to dance, and have tea and everything. Hahaha..Wow,that 's great! I wish you could be here,with me. I know lil' sister, but you're safe here. This family wanted a daughter of their own to replace the one they lost. Now I see that they accepted you as their own. We both should be grateful. I'll try to visit more OK? Hey,there's someone I want you to meet! This is Afro. Afro,this is Sio, my sister. Oh,hi Afro! Oh,hi. He's a newcomer at the sword school, but he's really good,almost as good as me, he's like a brother. Brother? Aha! So I guess,that makes you my brother,too. Yeah, I guess. Cool!! I just got another brother! Yap! Can I see the sword school someday too? Yeah sure,anytime. You're shy. And your hair is funny. Nice to meet you too. You'll soon be free. You can't just toy with science like that Lady Sio. Are you mad ?!! Once he's completed,he could very well be the ultimate samurai!! But if his growth is interrupted, he could end up just a pile of worthless protein jelly! Mad?! That's strange word coming from the very image of madness. But our plans could've been ruined! Oooh..it is part of the process,dear professor. The more I taunt Afro,the better. I want his suffering to be long and slow. His death is not my goal, only the final exclamation point. Don't you know me by now? Aaah...Of course,lady Sio!! You are truly twisted! But it's just...risks! HAAHAHAA..What a refreshing experience! I've twisted the most twisted scientist in the world with my twistedness. OHHH..Don't fear my round friend. Everything is moving so deliciously. Have a little faith. Yes, my Lady! With my guidance it won't end as badly as your failed masterpiece Kuma. Look at him! You've repaired him so many times there is no human left at all. He's just a mindless samurai doll. Soulless, dead. But now, muscle, bone ... ... blood. But they'll merge by nano-technology, chemically programmed neuroceptors, and things so forbidden,it's more alchemy than biotechnology. You truly are the world's most wicked, shit-faced genius scientist. You'll burn in hell for your insults against nature. You praise me so wonderfully,Lady Sio. I am not worthy of your poetry. You scum! History will mourn your trustees you now commit. You should be burned alive. Afro will chase me and my brother to -- city. When he arrives, he will see the consequences of his sins. His twice killed only friend, and his beloved father, shall impale him with their revengeful blades. Oooh..and then,the last moment,these hands will be the ones that end the life of Afro Samurai. DAAAMN! It is hot,up in this piece! Ain't there a quicker way to Cherry Hill? And by the way, you know that bitch Sio is walking us into a trap,don't you? And that was one weird family reunion too,ay Afro? Now I'm sure lots of folks would love to see that your daddy's alive again... but I'm not so sure seein' a living head, his nasty ass guts and shit,and what most folks ain't have in mind. I mean,how could he be alive,huh? Maybe it wasn't him. It's a trick. Maybe it was another robot, like that afro -- you killed awhile back. Or maybe like a muppet, you know like drawn by hand or somethin'. OK..Oh,oh,OK..that was stupid. It ain't doll. Whatever it was,one thing is for sure!! That biach is craaazy!!! Oh and,umm.. what you wanna do 'bout this kid who follow us? So you killed his Popps,now he probably tryin' to ax you. That sounds faliliar,don't it? No sweatin',no sweatin', kid ain't gonna last much longer. He's been dragging behind us in this heat for days. He'll dead by morning. Sorry Daddy. I wish you three could've seen the look on his face. when I showed him the living head of his own dead father. Never forget that it was Afro Samurai that made you what you are. He will live in hell on Earth, for what he's done to us. You will enjoy every second of excruciating agony that I'll inflict upon him. You'll watch as he bleeds from his very pores. Listen to the sound of his breaking bones. Smell his fear and his burning flesh. His death will be so filled with horror, it will pass into legend. And I too,as his legendary executioner. Mount climbing what joke is this man? We ain't got no equipment, I need a -- drink. You gotta rope? You sure we're goin' the right way? HUH!! Askin' thin' Afro. I think I'm holdin' down man. At least I'll have a stroke. You're stressin' me out. I hate hights. Is this the mean spot? Damn! I've been back in the day,this place was sweet. It's like a messed up -- paw. Been here candy corn,funk heights,some mean ass coasters. The whacks. Ain't nobody home now,tho'. What happened to them man? Shame it's all in ruins. Who did this? Hey,Afro. You sure this is the place that chick's ass should be waitin' for you? Wow,check it out,that's justice. You know you never did ask for no directions 'long the way. Hey Afro! Now,who this is? Hmm,costume party? Welcome Committee? Comedy troup? AAAAAM..Thanks, but no thanks. We've goota get to a meeting,OK? OK!Let's see,ummm... YO! Funny Face. You seen a crazy sexy bitch with a Teddybear-headed dude round here? There ain't no blood! OOOOH!...What the ...? OOOH!! OOOOH Afro!! I might go die here! Daaaamn! Lady Sio is not here. You remember us do you,Afro Samurai? Who would've imagine that the boy we once knew,would return as such a mad executioner. Driven only by his murderous rage, to bring death and chaos to the world. Draw your sword Afro Samurai. Now, you die! Professor? Hello, my lady. Please rejoice,the restauration of Afro's father is in the final stage. However, this stage is very sensitive, and if the slightest error occurs, we still could lose everything. They are gone. What's this? They'd never undertake anything without my orderss. What've you done? Pehaps they went into town. What do you mean? Or..perhaps they challenged Afro Samurai without you. But don't fear! Who knows they might just win. After all,you might be surprised to hear, that thay all have quite an impressive area of gadgets, engineered in their bodies..Not to mention the special drug injection in them too. AHAHAH...Lady Sio? What sport is this? My,my,my..what a heisty princess we have here. Regeneration is not yet... OOOHHHH!!! You did such a splendid job,dear Professor. You got all the clairs, all the right gratifications I own my thanks. Now, it is time for you to make a well deserved break. Good night, Professor! AAAAH! The other executioner is about to awaken. a No matter your intentions. There are things that we cannot allow you to do. We must not allow our lady Sio to thread the path of darkness. Such a sweet lady she is. We will not allow to fall from grace. Instead,we will be the sinners. All I wanted was for Afro,to see the town he destroyed. I wanted him to see the consequences of his sins, before I slit his throat. But now my vasalls are most likely dead. Fools rush in, where angels fear to thread. Michael, shoot him now!! What are you waiting for? Do it! Shoot 'em. She is dead already. Do it for our lady Sio. Go away. Afro Samurai ... I knew that sooner or later,this day would come. I will die with you. Afro you made it!! How'd you survive old boy? Tell me What I miss? You know I get hit,by sweepin' God, I'm hurt too. But I'm tough! So I'm worth! You waxed them ugly jokers? What the ...? Follow me, son. Holy shiiiit !!! Now,I have officially seen it all. Sio, Jinno. Hey Afro! Why you got to walk dirctly in the every trap. You stupid or what? Up there is the crazy bitch who've been pullin' the strings this whole time. And your own revived robo pal,who don't like your ass neither! On the top of that,we've fallen for some freak of nature, you think is your Dad! That is my real father! Wrong answer,you're an idiot. And this is far as I go. See ya! I have come my father, and No.1 headband. What a surprise! But what can you possibly do, with your body so utterly destroyed? We can torture you. Death will come slowly. Why didn't you wear the No.1 headband? I just wanted revenge for you. Whatever your reason,one must shoulder the burden of destiny that -- puts 'em on the headband. You should know that by now. Become The No.1,you can never escape the cycle of blood! The No.1 kills or is killed! You don't have the luxury to choose whos blood you spill! Take back the headband,fear not my son. Father wait! Father! Oh look,look my dear brother. Afro Samurai is about to meet his end,just as I planned. At the hands of his own father. He'll finally pay for the pain he caused us, for the pain he caused to thousands like us. Jinno, Jinno! Kill him! Kill him once and for all! HAHAHAAH!!! Aff-ro... Kill him Afro, waste him! He ain't your real father! That's it! Finish him, do it! I do not kill my father. Then this is the end of Afro! Did you see that Jinno? We did it. We finally brought him to justice. And it was we,we who killed him. Look,look my dear brother. Jinno? Jinno? Aff-ro... AFFROOOO...!!! What have you done? What have you done to Afro?! Why..? Jinno! Why are you protecting Afro?! He is dead now! It's no use! Have you forgotten what Afro did to us? Do you? Jinno! Afro.. my dearest.. brother... I must protect sword master's dojo. Must.. protect everyone. Including my brother, Afro! I love you, my Jinno. My brother. It's been a long time. Hasn't it Sio? How have you been, princess? Jinno... Run Afro,you can't win! I said run dammit! You can't win this one! He's too strong! He ain't human! Don't! Doon't!! Shut..up! It'll soon be over! Forgive me, but you're not my father. My father died a long time ago. Fear not! Father.. Anytime you're ready! HAHAH..From look on your face, I'd say you had a helluva rough day! You knew this,didn't you?! You knew it don't ever end. But you know,don't turn your back. That's the only choice you have left. I've been waiting a long time for you! Sluanjem prilagodio i obradio: GuRuGeoRgeSubotica
