Sure, they're scary. But they're kind gods. Really? Idiot, don't eat things like fireflies. Dragons are scary, but these days, humans are even scarier. They've come. Daddy's going to have a talk with them first. Go and hide in the grass around here. What? But I wanna go too! No! I'll call you when we finish talking and then-" This, right? That's right. Bring it over when I call you. You can give it to him. Doesn't this carp look delicious? I'd do anything to have this. You'll be able to catch something like this in no time. You reckon? Yeah. Now, hurry up and hide somewhere. Okay. Get down lower. Daddy, something feels weird tonight. Be careful. I know. My plate feels really dry tonight... Well, I'm drunk, but in a pleasant way. I apologize sincerely for keeping you so late. Me too. I stayed too long. Don't say such things. Please come by again. I can't come up with money that way all the time, you know" No! I didn't mean it in that way! It's easy to rewrite account books, but you'll never know when they'll suspect you... Moreover, the superiors are so bothersome these days. Please be careful. I keep it at a level where they won't find out. After all, we're just turning land into farmland; not that more farmland is needed. Our nests are being feathered in place of the farmers'. Indeed. Evening. Ah! I didn't mean to scare you! Please excuse me. I won't take much of your time. Could you please listen to my story for a second? I actually have a request to an official such as yourself. A request? About what? Well... I'm someone who's living in the Ryuujin swamp. According to rumors I've heard, there's a plan to reclaim the Ryuujin swamp and turn it into a paddy field. That plan... Could you please reconsider it? If you take the swamp away from us, we can't live. Please, reconsider it. This is beyond a meek monster like yourself. P-Please forgive my rudeness! You! Kappa... You were listening to our conversation, weren't you? Well, I couldn't hear what you were talking about... But you were talking and looking pleased... Stop lying! If I don't stop the reclamation, you're going to tell the local magistrate what you heard, isn't that right?! H-Hold on please! What are you talking about? I didn't hear anything! Stop pretending that you didn't hear! Trying to blackmail a samurai? Outrageous! F-Forgive us! Forgive us! Idiot! Don't come here! Daddy! This! Give this and-" Forget it and go back! Samurai-sama, you can have this carp, so please don't get angry with us! Please forgive Daddy! Be quiet! Shimizu-sama! Be on guard, there may be others too! N-No! There aren't any others! Just us! Let's run! They're gonna attack us at any moment! Officer! Please calm down! Daddy? Daddy?! I-It's a curse! So not fair! Bali island? I'm going to Hokkaido! I'm going to my dad's home village. Jeez, am I the only one without a holiday plan? This is serious. It's already July. Summer holidays are gonna start real soon. What about your parents' home towns? You're not planning to visit them? Both of my parents come from Saitama, so they said it's too close. Hey, where's Bali island? Dunno. Somewhere in the South. What's there? Erm... the sea? Are you stupid? You better know more about it. I'll find out once I get there. It doesn't matter! Damn you! Eugh! Lame Kikuchi! Kou-chan fancies Kikuchi? Stop kidding! No way! See ya! Hey! I'm heading off! That hurt... Really... A fossil... ...of a tortoise? Awesome! Uehara-kun! What's that? Nothing! Can you climb up? Are you alright? You aren't hurt? It's all because you were walking there. Huh? Show-off! Ugly-face! That'll be brother! Check before you open the door! Who is it? It's me. Brother's come home a mess! What? Kouichi! I... tripped. Seriously, will you stop it? It's troublesome enough that the laundry's not drying properly at the moment. Don't increase the amount of laundry! You! Understood? Mmm... Don't "Mmm" me. Yes. Now go get changed. Yes... Huh? What're you doing? It's got... nothing to do with you! Get lost! Kouichi? What're you doing?! Er, umm... You've even locked the door? Open this door! I wasn't doing anything. I was just washing an unusual stone I picked up. Then why did you lock the door? 'Cos "this" kept getting in my way. I didn't! You did. I was only watching! What?! What?! Hey, what is it?! Hey! No! Really! No! No! No! Quick! Quick! Get rid of it! Anywhere! What? Seriously! No! Gross! Please! Quickly! Hey, isn't this a kappa? A kappa?! Yeah... Hey, is it true? I see, so in this kind of situation you come home early? Hey, Hi-chan, where's the kappa? Dunno. Wow! Dad, you're early! Wow! So, this is it? Amazing! It really looks like a kappa! No, this is a kappa. Well, it does look like one. It is one! Where did you find it? At Kurome river. Be careful! It looks pretty cute, don't you think? Yeah... It was a lot smaller, but it got bigger as I soaked it in water. Coo! Now and then it cries "Coo," so I thought I'd name it Coo. Wait! Hold on! What do you mean by "name it"? Don't tell me you're planning on keeping it?! Please, Dad. No! You aren't allowed to keep such a creepy thing in this house! I don't like it either! Mom, don't be so negative. Here, take a look at it. I don't want to! It's surprisingly cute. Really! I won't! Please. Stop it! Stop it! Don't come closer! I said, please. Stop it! That's enough! Otherwise, I'm going to get angry. Don't... kill me. What?! Don't... kill me. Save... me... Kouichi! Place it back in the water! Quick! Erm, sure. Hey! It just spoke! Pour water onto the plate on its head. Apparently, a kappa is weakened if its plate dries. Huh? It's true? Erm, yeah... Now, hurry up! So you could talk? Did you feed it anything? Yeah, I thought that kappas are usually associated with cucumbers, so I gave it a few slices of cucumber. It's eaten a little. Seriously, it's not an insect, you know. You have to feed it with something that will give it more energy! Like what? Let's see... Something like... Erm... Would it eat sashimi and the like? Hey! Hey! That's a good idea! Here, open your mouth... It ate it! Wow! As expected from Mom! Not bad, eh? So, what shall we do? Kouichi, can you really take the responsibility? Sure, I will. Definitely! Kouichi, for the time being, let's keep it a secret that we have a kappa in our house. What? Why? It's pitiful to place a kappa in front of excited crowds in its current state, don't you think? Are we keeping it? Your brother wants to keep it. Really? It's so weak. Why don't we help it? Hey. She's really annoying. Get lost. Seriously! That kid! I told him so many times last night too! I'm coming in. Here's your lunch. It's your lunch. Can you eat it by yourself? Thank you very much. N-No problem. Excuse me, but where am I? What do you mean? Is it close to Kurume river? Apparently, in the past, Kurome river was called "Kurume river." How far in the past was that? Around the Edo period... What?! Hey, Coo was born in the Edo period? Ah, you know, they wore their hair in a topknot, a top-knot. What are you doing? What about samurai? Swish! Slash! Splatter! Hey! Something's wrong with it! What's wrong? Hey, Coo, are you okay? Is it the samurai? Are you scared of samurai? Daddy was slain by that samurai... I see. I'm sorry. And after that, there was an earthquake. I fell into a crack in the ground and got buried alive. What?! So you've been buried till now? How fortunate that you stayed alive... Coo, relax. There aren't any samurai anymore. Why? Why? That's because... A lot of things happened, and the era of the samurai ended more than a hundred years ago already. I'm greatly indebted to you. Thanks to your care, I've fully recovered. I will be visiting you at some point with some fresh fish. Thank you so much. Now then, I shall return to Ryuujin swamp. What? Hey, Kouichi! Coo, hold on a second! Is it this way? Are you thinking of going outside? You can stay with us! "A kappa and a human can't live together," that's what Daddy used to say. Er... Well, that might be true, but the outside world's changed a lot since you last lived in it. There are a lot of dangers too... That's right. Are there samurai out there? dad/No. No, there aren't! There are a lot of different types of danger out there these days. Guys sure are desperate... It's best if you don't go out there. Coo? dad/Er... In that case, maybe I'll stay in your care for a little longer. dad/Please, please. Isn't your plate dry? It is. Bring some water! Not tap water, but mineral water! Sure! Wow! This is good water! This is spring water. Can you tell? Yeah. Hey, what's Coo's real name? I can't tell you that. What? I was told that if I ever tell a human my name, I'd get defiled or cursed by the human! We won't do such a thing! Coo! Because I've been buried in the ground so long, I've forgotten my real name! What?! Cheer up. You'll remember it eventually. Until then, will you be fine with "Coo"? Coo... So I wind up taking care of it after all. Its food isn't cheap either... I'm not talking about you. Ayame-chan, Hitomi-chan, goodbye! Bye-bye! Excuse me! Thank you. Well then... Bye-bye! What's that? Snails! Ossan! Go away. Hitomi, don't bully it! Hi-chan always sits here! Oh, it's a mai-mai. It's a snail! Stupid! It's not stupid! You call it a mai-mai too. What? No! It's eaten it. It ate the snail! You didn't catch it for Coo? Don't humans eat mai-mai? Well, there are cases where you eat it, but... What? You don't eat it raw! You cook it properly. It's called escargots... That's just a Shimeji mushroom. I won't feed you snails at home. They're quite good you know, escargots. You want to try them in a restaurant? No, I don't want to! I don't! I don't! I don't! Coo, what other kinds of insects do you eat? Please, stop it. Diving beetles, giant water beetles and the sort. Dragonflies are pretty good too. Apart from that, worms. Kouichi, what's this?! Don't open it! You've got to hide yourself. This is a bicycle. Something you ride on. Don't stick your head out, and don't talk either. Kouichi, something's coming! That's a car. That's also a vehicle. It won't do anything to you. This is where I found you. You were buried in that hole. Is this Kurume river? Yeah, it's called Kurome river now. This is Ryuujin swamp?! What's this building? Where's Ryuujin swamp gone to?! Your voice is too loud. Are you sure this is the right place? Yeah, this is where Daddy and I used to live. Maybe it was buried? There aren't any swamps around here... Coo! That's a train over there! A huge vehicle! Coo... The area around here isn't that much different from the past, is it? Can I come out? No you can't! People pass by here and there are houses around here too. Wherever you go, it's full of people... Well, yeah... There aren't any of them around here anymore. What? Kappas... It can't be helped, a few hundred years have passed after all. Where should I go? Just stay here. Mommy was also killed by a human. I... won't do such a thing, neither will my family. As long as you stay here, you'll be safe. It's true! Kouichi! Dinner! Eat and regain your spirit! Huh? Dad's home early these days. Hey, don't handle him so roughly! It's alright. Here, Coo. This is your chair. What's wrong with Coo? Is he sick? No, I took him outside today. You weren't seen by anyone, were you? Hmm, I think it was fine. "Think" isn't good enough! That's mine! Mine! What's this? You're so noisy! You don't use it anymore, why don't you let him borrow it? No! Huh? What? Hitomi! Look what you did to him! Really, what's going on? No! I want it back! What's up, Coo? Is it time for sumo wrestling? I see, you thought it was time for sumo wrestling? Kappas love to sumo wrestle! Ah, yes, it said so in a book. Oh? So it was true! What's this? You're really weak, Hitomi. Awesome! You're really strong, Coo! It's nothing. I'm really surprised. He's so tiny... Next, it's my turn. Come on! Just wait a second! What? You want to wrestle too, Mom? No, we're having dinner first! Now! Hitomi, you too! Okay! We'll eat and get some energy, and then we'll have our match! Yeah. Let's do that! Well then, shall we? Let's do it! Be careful! Okay! Face each other... Ready... Go! Ready... Go! What?! No way! I was caught off guard! One more time! Sure. What's up, Kouichi? One more time! I give in... No! You're not allowed! Stupid brother! Shut up. I can't help it. Coo's too strong. Hey, Daddy? Alright! Shall we? You are? Face each other... Ready... Go! Ready... Go! It's not good to just rely on force. Wow! I give in. You're strong, Coo. It's impossible. Next, it's Mommy! What? No! No! No way! Now, stop bullying Coo. Otherwise you might be thrown again. Does that taste good? Yeah, it's good. In celebration of your win, I'll let you drink a little. Hey, don't. In that case, I'll just pour a tiny bit onto your plate. Here, congratulations. Wow! This water's full of energy! Well, I kind of feel good. Seems like the alcohol soaked through his plate... Really? Wow! He's turned completely red! See, didn't I tell you? Ah well, I hadn't really expected... I pray to Ryuujin-sama... Is he drunk? ~ The plate's drying out; make it rain. ~ ~ Hey-ho ~ ~ A drip, a drop, pouring rain. ~ ~ Drop, drop, drop. ~ ~Jyon jyorage ~ ~ Once it rains, even the elderly will begin to dance! ~ ~ A drip, a drop, pouring rain. ~ ~ Drop, drop, drop. ~ ~Cooooooooooo~ Coo! Oh, goodness! Bring water and ice! Coo, are you okay? You can't just open that by pushing. Coo? Just do what I say. Yo! So it was you! Don't speak out loud. The people in the house will notice you. Speak in your head like me. I can't do that yet. Just try it. Can you hear me? Yeah. Really? Yeah, I can hear you. A lot of my folks had this sort of ability, but I couldn't use it back then... Maybe it's because I've stayed in the ground for so long? But I didn't know that dogs had this ability too. You find ones with this ability every so often. Don't tell the people who live in this house about this, understood? Yup, I understand. It's such a nice rain. I should be thankful. You like rain? How unusual. I'm going to have a wander about. Be careful. Make sure you don't get seen by humans. Okay. Do you want to take that off and come with me? No, I have an obligation to the people who live in this house, so I can't take it off. How inconvenient. Not really. Thanks to this, I get fed. It's better than being a stray. Oh... Hey, make sure you return. The people who live in this house aren't that bad. Sure, and you're here too. Really? Is it that scary? Apparently. So you'll probably be completely freaked out. Seriously? What's this? It's just a film. Yeah, but... Kappa... Do you keep something that looks like one? What? A kappa? Ayana says she heard it from Hitomi-chan. That you keep a kappa in your house. What? I scolded her... But really, I don't think we can hide it forever... We should start thinking about what we're going to do with Coo... Jeez! Seriously, they take things too easy! It's not something that I should be worrying about! Show us the kappa, just to us. Please! Please! There's no such thing as a kappa... Don't lie to us! Everyone's talking about it on the internet! Family Uehara's Kappa! Sorry, there isn't one. Fine! Keep it all to yourself. I don't care anymore. Let's go. Eh? Hey! What on earth? Is it true?! He has a kappa? Do kappas actually exist anyway? Let's go. Do kappas actually exist? I'd laugh if they do. Let's go home. Shall we go somewhere before heading home? Oops! Sorry! Looser! Kikuchi-san, you should be angry, you know. That's right. If you leave it like this, they'll get carried away. It's fine. I don't mind. Why? She's so gloomy. Uehara-kun! Huh? The kappa... Is it that thing you found that time? Dunno. Protect it, will you? Shut up, ugly-face! Hey! Welcome home! Wow! It's boiling on the second floor. Can't stand it! Coo, let's sumo wrestle! Let's do it! You're freezing... Will you forgive me? Those guys... Really! Here! Cut it out! I told you not to sumo wrestle upstairs! I'm sorry... Sorry. Really, it was just getting good... I know Kouichi, can you read me this book! This... It's a kappa. Does it say something about kappas? It does. I wonder where this is? The home of folktales, Enno. A journey to meet the kappas. Seriously?! Can you meet kappas? It's not "Enno," but "Toono." Of course the answer's no. Going on a trip so far away with just you and Coo? What? Come on! Don't take such magazines so seriously. It doesn't actually mean you'd see any kappa." But if Coo goes, maybe we can find some sort of clue! Oh! Then how about we all go? We don't have any plans to go anywhere this summer anyway, right? What? What? Isn't it better if everyone goes? Hitomi wants to go too, right? Hi-chan wants to join the stamp rally. We can join that anytime. Come on, what do you say? Well... I'm in a rather delicate situation with my work this summer... What? Come on, Dad. Please... You're not allowed. Besides, do you even know how to get to Tono? I can go there once I've looked it up. No way, never. What kind of job is a "delicate" job? Please, Dad! Today, it will be sunny in most places. Check that you haven't forgotten anything! I'm checking now! The temperature will be higher than usual. You've got your cell phone? Yeah. Your ticket? Got it. Well, I'm off now. Make sure you drink water frequently. I know. I hope you find your own kind. Okay. See ya. Don't push yourself too hard. Make sure that Coo doesn't get seen. Sure. All you talk about is that... Well then, I'm off. Call us when you get there! Yeah! Mom's so annoying. Always repeating the same things again and again. Don't say such things about your parents. Don't speak. We'll get caught. He doesn't even look back. He's just embarrassed. Huh? Why? What on earth? Cooo~ Don't come out! Can you bear with it for a while longer? Coo? Take a look outside. Coo! It's moving fast! The scenery is flying by! The paddy field! It's a paddy field, Kouichi! Just like it was around Ryuujin swamp! Really? So where we live used to be like that? Looks like there are kappas around there. Yeah! AnnShin-hanamaki. This is Shin-hanamaki. Customers changing to the Tamae-line... Eh, it suddenly got so hot... Yes, it has. The train will soon be arriving at platform two... Nice to meet you. This place is full of kappas! Bring it on! Why didn't you call as soon as you arrived? Kappas? Stop wandering around and go rent a bike. Be careful of the cars, okay? I know... Your brother's safely arrived. He might as well dump Coo there! Don't say such things. We've arrived at the Kappa pool! Are we there? Don't come out! Can I come out? No, there are a lot of people here. Does it look like there are kappas? Look over there. You see the camera there? That camera films the river around the clock, and the images are placed on the Internet. So if there's a kappa you'd know straight away, right? Sure, if you capture a kappa, you'll get 10, 000, 000 yen as a reward. But you mustn't injure it. You catch kappas?! A kappa?! Yes, for my summer holiday homework, I'm researching kappas. I see. Yup. la place where kappas may still exist? Toshitsuyo-san, where do you suggest? If I had a clue, I'd have caught one and got the 10, 000, 000 yen as my reward by now. There aren't any kappa that'll make a mistake and let themselves be caught by you! I'll tell you some places, so show me your map. Ah, sure. Thank you very much. Be careful! Yes. It's boiling. That felt good! Splash some more! You sure? Definitely! Does it say that there are kappas here? Nah, something else. It's around here. That's a good river. I can smell fish too. Are you there, kappas? Can I come out? Can I? Okay. I'll put you down." Hey! Wait a second! He's not coming up... This isn't good... A live fish tastes so good! After so long, it's so good to be able to swim again! The river's great, don't you think, Kouichi? Yeah... Kouichi's going to swim too, right? You'll swim too, right? Come on! Hurry up! I wish I'd brought swimming trunks. I-It's freezing! What's this? What's this? You're acting like a girl! So what do you think of the Kappa's Fart-Swim? I drank water because of that! Coo's swimming is super awesome! It's unreal! Any kappa can swim like that. Kappas are amazing! I'm thrilled! They aren't here, are they? It's a river where you'd expect kappas to be around... He told me a few more places, so let's visit them tomorrow. Okay... This is a Magari-ya. It was built toward the end of the Edo period. Found in Nagano, Iwate, Fukushima and other areas of Japan that have heavy snowfall. The house is L-shaped to enable the stable to be built within the house so livestock would survive during the harsh winters. So this is a Magari-ya? It's impressive... The kids from Tokyo sure are different. What? No, really! I'm not. Seriously! Sure I live in Tokyo, but the house is surrounded by paddy fields. It's really a countryside. Here you are. Do you know what a Zashiki-warashi is? Yes, vaguely. It's something like a monster, isn't it? It's said that a Zashiki-warashi lives in our house. What? So if you do see a Zashiki-warishi, I don't want you to be scared of it. Zashiki-warishi is a good god that brings fortune to the house. Erm, ah, so what's bent about this Magari-ya? You came from Tokyo? On your own? Kids from Tokyo are so independent! No, it's nothing. No. No, it's something! It's something. No, I'm not that... And he eats well too. Yes, he does. Hmm, a kappa? That's unusual. You must be the Zashikiwarashi-sama. That's right. I've come to look for my own kind, but I can't find them. Do you know where they might be? I haven't seen any kappas in the last hundred years. Coo... Did my kind go elsewhere? Or have they all died? What? s ~ The flower bloomed. The wind blew. ~ s ~ The snow danced and everything disappeared. ~ s ~ But I am still here, ~ s ~ and somehow, so are you. ~ s ~ Just sleep. Go to sleep. ~ s ~ It has, it does, and it always will; tomorrow will always come. ~ s ~ Don't think about your folks, sweet child. ~ s ~ Sleeping child, stay asleep. Sleep well, sleeping child. ~ I hope we'll find some kappas today! Kouichi... Yeah? Let's just go home. What?! But you don't know if what the Zashiki-warashi said is true or not. I know. How?! If you look hard enough, there may be some place... Kouichi, our kind doesn't lie. Humans are the only ones that lie. Hey, Kouichi, let's go home. We're getting the bullet-train that departs in the afternoon. We can't go back till then. What to buy... How about a Kappa rice cake? A Kappa rice cake? Yes, a pack of 10 pieces is only 200 yen. Are they good? Yes. I'll have three packs then... Hey, has Coo ever left the place he was born in? No, this is the first time. Right then! Kouichi, where are we going? Wait and see. Ouch! Kouichi, don't throw me like that! Coo! I'm... speechless... What a huge pond! It's the sea. Sea? Why don't you have a swim? Water! Water! Quick! Water! It stings! What salty water! I doubt there are any fish in such salty water. There are a whole load of them! Wow, it must be a really salty fish! What're you saying! The fishes Coo eats at home were all caught from the sea. Hey, when we get back, let's look for kappas elsewhere. Yeah, sure. I'm going to go and get stung again. Hey, you! Are you Uehara Kouichi-kun? I'm working for this place... I'd like to hear your story about your kappa. Just for a bit! Huh? Hey, isn't this it?! Sorry, kid. Take a photo! What're you doing?! I didn't do anything! This thing... It did something! What happened? They took photos! Coo? Those people from the weekly pictorial magazine dropped by during lunch. They were probably waiting for you. Like I said, I'm asking you not to publish them! Coo's swimming is super awesome! He can jump like a dolphin! That's exactly why I'm asking you not to! It's true! Right, Coo? What's a dolphin? It's a f-i-s-h! Idiot! You took it without our consent. There's no way! Hey! Who's more stupid? A dolphin's a mammal! Idiot! Hey, wait! I'm not finished yet! Kouichi! Liar! A dolphin's a fish! Right, Mommy? A dolphin's a mammal... What? I'll teach you properly about them next time. Anyway, Coo's really amazing! He can swim by farting! Seriously! How can you act like that in our current situation? Apparently Coo can swim by farting. What? Hey, hey, Coo's about to appear in a magazine. The whole of Japan's going to find out about him! Don't take it out on us! Just think about what we're going to do now! Come to think of it! I have a souvenir for Hitomi! I picked it up from the sea. It's a pretty stone, isn't it? It's an apology for eating your mai-mai the other day. Wow, it's beautiful... Hitomi, what about a thanks? That's just glass, isn't it? I'm sorry. Thank you. It's fine. He's beginning to take an interest in girls, huh? Alright then! Hey, what? I'm doing you a favor! Jeez, he's still a brat... Well, Kouichi still has a long way to go. That's all. Why isn't Kouichi more friendly to her? Humans are complicated creatures. You understand a lot about humans. Yeah, I've lived for a long time with humans. Humans do scary stuff sometimes... True... Uehara-san! Just one word, please! Please! Uehara-san! Oh no, he looks old in that. His hair's strange too. Not again. Hello? Yes? I'm sorry, but we don't want interviews. Excuse me. Thank you for visiting. I'm sorry, but... Sorry? About what? Come on. Keep it strong! Well, that is... He's really frightened, and we'd like to decline all interviews. By "He" do you mean the kappa? Excuse me. Please, hold on a second! For today, we're altering the scheduled programs and providing live coverage on the kappa that's living in this present day... Coo, you're really popular. Why don't you want to be on TV? It's scary... Those people... and that thing with big eyes... They're scary... The surrounding area is normally a quiet neighborhood, but... Because of me, this matter's become huge. I feel really bad... Do kappas really exist? Earlier on, the head of the Uehara family, Uehara Yasuo-san appeared at the front door, but... Don't worry. It's quite fun! He announced that the kappa was scared... By the way Coo, that time, did you really break the camera? I don't know. ...and now to summarize, the kappa is about a meter long... I felt as though that eye and the flashing light were going to eat me, so... Something that resembles hair is on its head... It scared me, so... It'd be really cool if you did have some supernatural power! What are you going to do about work today? I'll take a holiday today. Additionally, the camera used to photograph the kappa was destroyed by some kind of power. This may be evidence of kappas having so-called supernatural powers... What is it? Nothing... Aren't we going to watch it? No, we aren't. For goodness sake... You don't have to pick it up. Someone's here. dad/What? dad/Damn it! That's the house! Yeah, I'm close by... Yeah, can you come over? Hey, Mom, is that the house? Let's go there! Quick! That's the house! It was on the Internet! What else does Kappa-chan eat? Erm, like cucumbers... Cucumbers! Of course, cucumbers if we're talking about kappas! So that was true! I look kind of old there... So apart from that, what else does... You can't exactly help it. You are old. Erm, it's getting late now, I really have to go... It's not fair. Mom and dad got to go on TV. It's not as if I went on TV because I wanted to. It was really embarrassing. It's my fault! It's my fault that Yukari grew old! No, really. That was just a joke. See, I'm still young. My skin's still smooth. Coo? What's this? So rude! But I wonder why they don't show it to us? Uehara-san, was it? We don't even know if it's really in their house or not, right? It's become such a hot topic, but if we can't even see it, how are we supposed to believe it? We're talking about a kappa, a monster, of all things. I won't ask you to go on live TV, but can I make a short film of you using our own video camera? Yasuo's in trouble, right? Well... It's okay. I can't trouble you all anymore. Really? Thank you! Coo, can you lower your head a little? Like this? Yeah, like that. That's his plate. Can you also show me your back? He's got a shell on his back. This isn't anything new to you, is it? Can you spread out your hand? He has webbed hands. So, the kappa really does exist. What do you think, ami-san? This is a real surprise! It's truly a being. You can call it nothing but a kappa. Makes me want to go see and confirm it even more. What's going on? It's so sensational, but they're ignoring it? Well, I'm off. Be careful. Sure. Oh, there he is! Uehara-san! Excuse me! Let me through! Uehara-san! Please allow us to make a film casting Coo-chan as the main lead! Please! For a TV advert! This is the plan for a drama series! Wouldn't you like to have a volume of kappa photographs? One-two, Coo-chan! Take a look over here! Coo-chan! You're being a nuisance to the neighbors! Please don't shout! Shut up! You're the one who's loud! Hey, come out! That's right! Come outside! Please don't shout! So could Coo-chan and your family please make an appearance on the TV program they're sponsoring? We have important deals with that company, so please. Alright. Really? I owe you all that much. Besides, I can't be afraid of them forever. Awesome! TV! Okay? Whatever they ask you, just ignore it. Okay. Excuse me, my child's coming out. Please don't film him! Go ahead. Please let him through! Kouichi-kun! How's Coo-chan? Please, let us hear your story. Kouichi-kun! Hey, hold on, Kouichi-kun! Wait! Don't run! Just a bit! Hey! It was really troublesome. I couldn't get out of the house... Kappa's fart! Uehara-kun! The name of that dog the other day, it's Ossan, isn't it? When we were in Grade one or two, I saw the name while visiting your home. Why did you name it Ossan? When I picked him up, he looked like an old stranger, so... Did you go anywhere? Like on a trip? Erm, Toono. Really? Then did you go to Hanamaki? Erm, no, only to change trains... Is that so... What about Hanamaki? It's the home village of Miyazawa Kenji. Do you like him? Miyazawa Kenji? Yup, I like him. You've never read his works? Erm, not really. Please don't push! At this moment, Coo-chan has finally appeared outside! Hey, are you okay? I'll come with you. Just ask them. What's wrong? Can't we take Ossan with us? What? What's up? Coo's asked if we could take Ossan too. What? Please... Hey, what're you doing? The car's coming out! Please stand back! Please don't push! Stand back! Stand back! Wow! They fell! Amazing! Don't be scared. It'll be fine. There's something wrong with Kouichi. Yeah, he's in high spirits. Humans can change all of a sudden. My previous owner was like that. What happened? We got on really well when he was a kid. We used to play together a lot. I really liked him and he took good care of me too. But after a while, he began to be bullied by his own sort. So for him, I was the only one he could bully in return. I was beaten every day. He probably was too. I never understood why he had to face that, but it was really sad. I didn't like being hit, and I didn't like seeing him turning into what he was either. So I ran away. I ran and ran, until I finally collapsed, and then Kouichi came. Kouichi's similar to that guy when he was a kid. I wonder why humans change? I wonder too... Good morning. Good morning. This way, please. Please wait here until it's time. See you in a while. What shall we do? About its lower body? It's not a good idea to have it exposed... It's not? Definitely not. Not the entire body... Where are the kids? Oh, that. You know, Uehara's Kappa-chan is being broadcast on TV. Really? Was it today? Nobody's going to come today... Let's go and watch it, shall we? Yeah, sure. Well then, we'd like to invite our special guest for today... m...Coo-chan, the kappa, makes his appearance! Please! It's so cute! Now, over here, please. Thank you for coming on. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. It's Coo-chan! Hello. Yes, really... Isn't that a robot? To begin with, there are still a lot of people who don't believe that kappas exist, but... What? It's real! It's true! Really! It's broadcasting right now! Today's show uses no tricks! Please trust your own eyes! That kid! Oh! Isn't he that kid?! So Coo-chan, how do you feel right now? Oh, maybe he's feeling a little nervous? Well, he can't help it, can he? This is awesome! I'm thrilled! What? It kind of smells. It's the perfume. It seems like Coo-chan doesn't like perfume. I don't smell! Well, let's see. Ah, you smell! You do! Now then, I'd like to welcome our other guest. He studies folklore and claimed that kappas truly existed, it's Shimizu Sumio-san. Please. Over here, please. Welcome. Hi. In this part, we'd like to take a closer look at the mysteries surrounding kappas. Shimizu-san is someone who has long believed in the existence of kappas and researched... Hey, what's wrong? This guy... He looks exactly like the man who killed my Daddy! What?! Well, I'm deeply moved. I'd like to thank, Coo-chan. So you had confidence in your theory? Sure. There was evidence that was passed down in our family. What could that be? A kappa's arm. A kappa's arm? Yes, it's the remnants of a mischievous kappa that my ancestor, a samurai, got rid of. This is it. Because this was in our house, I just couldn't think of kappas as just being imaginary monsters. Shimizu-san, would you be able to show it to us? Do you think it's really a kappa... Sure, although, maybe it's something Coo-chan would rather not see. I want to see it. Daddy... Erm, you mean... That arm... It's your father's arm? No way... It can't be... Coo, is that true? Is that your dad's arm? It's true! It's Daddy's arm! How do you know? Because I can! I can't help it! But... What to do? Could I... Have it back? It's really precious to me. Your ancestor killed my Daddy! My Daddy wasn't a mischievous kappa! He was an expert at catching fish, kind and... An admirable kappa! Daddy only asked if they could refrain from turning Ryuujin swamp into a paddy field because that was our home, but... Your ancestor suddenly drew out his sword and killed Daddy! The Daddy who I really loved! Is that true? It's too much of a coincidence. Is this for real? Shimizu-san, what Coo-chan just said, do you think it's true? Well, that... It's something that happened in the Edo period, so... Ah yes, that's true... Coo... In that case, Coo-chan has the ability to see the past? You could say he has some kind of mysterious power... Don't cry. Stop it! What?! What's this?! Hey, what's going on in the studio?! Hey, this isn't good! What's happening? I can't see what's going on like this! Start the adverts! Y-Yes! The adverts have started. Coo-chan, calm down... Hand that arm over to... Hey, what are you guys doing? Go and save him! Damn it! It's alright. Don't be scared... We won't do anything... Get on! Wait! It... It got away! Coo! Erm, hold on! We're on air! What? A kappa and a dog? Hey! Catch that! Where do you want to go? Somewhere... A quiet place with no humans... Okay! Hey, that's Coo-chan! What is this place?! It's full of humans and cars everywhere! What? An arm?! They're so noisy! Wow! That was close! This is such a dangerous place! Hey, Coo-chan! Wait up! What? Hey! Coo-chan! Ossan, aren't you tired? You've run enough! No. Not yet! It feels good to be able to run every now and then. Hey, isn't that a kappa?! It's Coo-chan! Oh, Coo-chan! It's Coo-chan! Coo-chan! Don't come after us! Let's go after it! No way! Is that Coo-chan? Coo-chan! Wait! Oh crap! Ossan! Are you alright? I'm sorry, I screwed up... I'm afraid you have to go on your own from here... What?! No! Please get up! It hurts... Shit! It's my fault! It's my fault! I wonder if he's still alive... Would it have been better if I'd stayed and got beaten? If I had, he'd have a way to get rid of his frustrations... Here, here, here, here, and up! ...And become like that time again... Ossan! Ossan! Did it die? So cruel! Quick! Take a photo! A photo! Eugh! Looks gross! Hey, he's upset. He's got some weird power, doesn't he? How pitiful... Hey! It's meat! Meat! Let's eat it before the guts rot away! Let's eat! It's feeding time! Let's eat that little one too! What was that?! Coo-chan! It's dangerous! Coo-chan! Get down! Hey, where's the police? Call the police! Coo-chan! Coo-chan! Come down, Coo-chan! Watch out! He's climbing up! Coo-chan! Come down! Yeah! That kappa! Coo-chan! Coo-chan's climbing the tower! Is Ossan dead? Why... Hey, over there! Coo-chan! Where? Over there! Coo! There're stairs inside. Let's get closer. Can we get to the steel frame from the stairs? Sure, you can use the gateways in between. Excuse me, but we're the family with Coo. Daddy, there aren't any quiet places around here where there aren't any humans... This is like... A nest of humans. There are no kappas anywhere anymore... They were all killed by humans... It's completely dry... I'm out of energy... Daddy, what should I do? I'm tired... I want to go where Daddy is... If I fall from here, I can get there, right? Daddy, save me! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Coo! Stay still! We're coming to save you! Put the rope over there! Go on. Hurry! The keys! Quick! Ah, yes! Coo! Answer me, please! What's that cloud? It's freaky! Oh, no! What is it? I've got it, Daddy... You're saying that I shouldn't go there yet, right? Coo! Stay there! I'll never do anything that will upset Coo! So please! Don't run! Hold on tight. Here. Ossan wanted to save Coo, didn't he? He did what we couldn't do. Numerous people have claimed that they saw a dragon, however, nothing was seen on the photos or the video. The relationship between the dragon and Coo-chan remains a mystery, Banner reads: "The kappa's a dangerous monster! Get rid of it! A mysterious power threatens our peaceful lives. Isolate it immediately!". but the demands for a proper investigation into the powers that Coo-chan holds has become stronger. ...And then you twist as you swipe the opponent's leg out from under them. Like this? I see. Okay! One more time! Sure. Coo, it's ready. Ah, this is perfect. That looks good. Thank you for such a fine piece of work. It's nothing. Don't thank me for that. Hi-chan wants one too! I thought you'd say that. Here. That piece of glass you got from Coo-chan the other day... I mean, the stone, put it in here. Hitomi! Stop stuffing things down there! Yes. What're you two doing? Yay! Brother's the only one who's being left out! Yay! Did you want something similar, Kouichi? Not really. Oh! He wants one too! Shut up! You! Hey, wait there! Brother says... By the way, your dad said... Here, give that to me! There's no point in hiding anymore, so for our next holiday, we'll be visiting a place with a clean river. Really! Yay! Hey, so where are we going? It's not being decided yet. Are we taking lunch with us? Yes, we are. Can I catch fish there? Of course! Most likely the people from the TV station will come too, but dad said it doesn't matter. You must be looking forward to it. Right now everyone wants to see Coo-chan, but after a while, they'll get used to him. And then you'll be able to live like you used to. Yeah. I wanted to see the dragon too. But I was in such a situation, I didn't even realize it was there. Why don't you ask Coo-chan? I did ask if he could call it again, but he said that he didn't call it, that his dad did. "Yeah, right," you'd think, right? They're amazing, aren't they? Coo-chan and his father... Huh? I guess so... Hey! Lovey-dovey, aren't you, Kou-chan? Is this a friends-only-club? No! It's not like that! Hey, the gloomy Miss-Unlucky and the Kappa brother! You two suit each other! Hey, Kou-chan, isn't that kappa dangerous what with all those supernatural powers?! Crying and holding that mummified arm! Watching that scene freaked me out! That's 'cos it was his murdered dad's! It can't be helped! How do you know? Did you check their DNA? Hear! Hear! Coo can tell! What? What're you talking about? Have you turned crazy because of the kappa bug? What do you mean by "kappa bug"? My dad was saying that a kappa's similar to an alien, so it probably carries some strange diseases! Beware! Kappa bug! Kappa bug! Kappa bug! Kappa bug! Kappa bug! Kappa!" Stop it! Oh! Miss Unluckys upset! What's up? Having your period? I heard your dad left your family after having an affair. What? What's that got to do with anything?! Then it turns out... what was it? Your mom was having one too! Shut up, idiot! Stop it! Wow! I can see your panties! What are you getting all worked up about? Idiot! You got infected by the kappa bug too? Right? Go on! Do it! Beat him up! Come on! Push him! Push him! That's right! Beat him up! Come on! Alright! I'm sorry! You're strong... Coo taught me. He's strong at sumo wrestling. I see. It's the first time I've ever had a fight. It's best if you don't. Yeah. It's the same place as last time. It was around here where you found Coo-chan. Yeah, probably. We can't really tell where anymore, can we? It's been a while since then. Actually, Uehara-kun... I'm moving away. My parents are divorcing, so I'm moving to my mother's hometown. I'm moving the day after tomorrow, and I'll be attending a school there at the start of the new term. I see... Thanks for talking... to me. Hey, don't cry... A lot of stuff's happening to you. You know... But good luck... Erm, so, I'll be off now... See ya. Kikuchi, you better go home soon. What? Like I said, Coo says he's leaving! Why? A letter arrived for Coo, and he got all excited the moment he saw it. Kouichi! Take a look at this! It's a trick, isn't it? Kouichi, that wasn't written by a human! What do you think? What's wrong? Has something happened? No, nothing. How do you know? What if somebody's trying to trick you? I can tell by looking at it. It's better to do what it says. I'll go tomorrow! Tomorrow?! You don't have to rush, right? We were supposed to go to the river tomorrow. You were looking forward to it, weren't you? I'm sorry. Stupid Coo! Get lost! Hitomi... It's a bit sudden... Anyway, Coo is leav"Is moving on. It's modest, but tonight is his farewell party! Well then, wishing Coo all the best... Dad, why don't you stop him? Why are you letting him leave so easily? Kouichi, do you remember telling me how lively Coo was in the river at Toono? I do... We're different to Coo. Where we live and how we live. Then we can go to that sort of place! We were supposed to go there! But we can't go there everyday. Coo used to live daily in that kind of habitat. The way Coo's living now, it's not natural to him. Daddy used to say this: "Humans snatched water and land from us, eventually the wind, sky and even the places for the Gods will be taken as theirs. In return, they will lose their souls..." I used to think that humans were those sorts of monsters... From your point of view, we probably are... But after living with you, I've come to realize that not all humans are like that. Then why don't you just stay here? If I stay here, I'll have to live like a human. One day, when I die, I'll be going to a place where my Daddy, Mommy and all my ancestors are waiting. How could I face them if I'd forgotten the way of the kappa when I get there? Besides, if I stay here any longer, it'll get harder for me to leave you all. That's why I'm going. Come on, let's eat. Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Hurry up, quick! Now look at the camera, the camera. Right, one more! Coo, are you okay with the light? Yup, this flash isn't scary at all! Is this enough water and food? Plenty! Take the photos. It includes those from yesterday. I'll keep it safe with me. Right! Shall we go? Okay! Let's go! Hey, when's the next time you're coming again? Hey, tell me. When will you come again? Hitomi, Coo is... When... will you... Hitomi, don't cry. I don't know when it'll be, but I'll definitely come by and see you again. Kappas don't lie. Please believe me. I wish you the best. I'm sorry about how things turned out. Thanks for coming to our home! Not at all. Thanks for all the care. ...With the next hit, it'll be goodbye. Here comes the fourth, Suzuki-kun... Hey, look at that. He's holding something... People from the press! We've given up on raising Coo in this kind of environment! What does he mean? What's going on? I'm taking Coo to a place where he can live naturally like a kappa! Please stop observing our house from now on! Coo-chan? Right now? Where are you taking him?! We aren't wrong, are we? We aren't wrong. It was wrong until now. He's leaving?! Wait up! Hurry! Stop being so slow! Quick! Hurry! Looks like he's relocating Coo-chan! Right! They're all gone! Kouichi! Be careful. I'm dropping you. Okay. Coo, there's somewhere I want to visit beforehand. I thought you were up to something. Sure. Hello? Erm, is Sayoko-san there? Uehara-kun? What's up? Coo. Come in. Are you alone? Just come in. Okay. I'm sending Coo away now, so I thought before that... Who's this? Kikuchi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Coo, I haven't told you until now, but it's thanks to Kikuchi that I found you. So I owe my life to you too? Thank you so much. Oh, not at all. I'm glad I could meet you. Kikuchi's strong. She doesn't have anyone to help her, but she tries her best on her own. I was also harsh to Kikuchi... Kikuchi is leaving tomorrow too. So before that, I wanted Coo to meet Kikuchi. Kikuchi understood Coo's feelings far better than I did. Thanks. I better go before it gets too late. I'm going to Kiyose, just in case. Can I come with you to the station? What? Sure! Well then, shall we go, Coo? Kouichi, Kikuchi, I'm glad you two were the ones who found me. It was just a coincidence, really. It wasn't just a coincidence. It was definitely something that was decided a long time ago. Thank you. I thought that there was no place for me, but that was just me thinking. Like Coo-chan, I'll jump into a new place! Otherwise nothing will ever change. Yeah. Sorry, I think I said something that was a bit odd. It's fine. Can I write you a letter? What? Sure! I'll definitely write one back! Erm, do you know my address? Yeah. I kept the New Year's card you sent me before. Well then. Yeah. Coo, I'm going to send you off now. Okay... Are you okay? I'm fine. Well, I can't come with you any further. Erm, I'd like to send this package off. Write on this please. Ah, sure. Oh! Send it as a fragile item, please. It's done. Erm, when will it be picked up? That? Yes... In about an hour... Thank you. Kouichi, I'm sorry I surprised you. It's just that I could hear the voice of your mind this whole time. Kouichi, don't blame yourself so much. I don't have a grudge or anything. I enjoyed living with you, and that's not a lie. Coo! I-I had more to... Coo... It's alright, Kouichi. Well, we'll meet again sometime! Hey, Kouichi, I'm glad I didn't die. Kouichi, my life was saved by you, I'll take good care of it! I don't believe this! Hey, are you okay? Hey, you! Keep yourself strong! Erm, water... water! Phew! I'm back to life! Are you feeling okay? Sure! You're not a human, are you? How come you took the form of a human? To fool the eyes of humans, it's best to take the human form! I'm Kijimuna, it's like a relative of the kappas. Eventually, I'll teach you how to take the form of a human. It's really handy! You can go to bars where the young ladies are! What's this place called? This is Yanbaru in Okinawa. That was really dangerous. When I saw you on TV, I thought I've got to do something about this. Welcome. You can stay here as long as you like. Humans hardly ever come here. You can definitely take your time resting your mind and body. Thank you. I'll be under your care, Kijimuna-san. Stop it! Don't be so formal. You can just call me Ossan. Okay! I'm Coo. It's the name I was given by humans. Coo, there's a river in my forest. Why don't you go and take a swim? Yeah! I want to swim! To the God of this land, please allow me and Daddy to live here for a while. Allow me to take enough fish to keep me alive from this river. Does that feel good, Daddy? Hey, Daddy, like that Kijimuna Ossan, maybe there are kappas out there who can take the form of a human. After I've taken a rest here, I'm going to go on a journey to find the kappas. Then I'll go and see Kouichi too! Daddy... I'm sorry, but I made friends who are humans. A white towering thundercloud floats in front of us. Suddenly you fall silent and look up at the sky. I felt anxious and tried to look into your eyes, but you already made up your mind. I thought that I could stay beside you, even after the seasons changed. No matter how far apart we are, our hearts are connected. Don't close your heart even if someone's cold to you. There's always someone thinking of you right here. Please continue to smile in that place that allows you to be yourself. If you're in pain, I'll come and see you beyond this space and time. A drop that fell in summer eons ago is gently blown by the wind towards the future. Please continue to smile in a place where you can be yourself. If you're in pain, I'll come and see you... ...beyond this space and time.
