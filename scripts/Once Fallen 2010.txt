It's a harbor town south of Los Angeles, populated with the families of hard working blue-collar men who live and die by the codes of the Union and the bosses who controlled the ports. My dad was one of those men. I always imagined that I would some day be one, too. Beat got his name from the kids at school who pushed him around. So I started pushing back. But no one pushed him harder than his father when he came home from the bars at night. We'd smoke the cigarettes I'd stolen from my dad. Talk about the days in front of us. Places that we'd go. Ships we'd sail. And ports with girls. That thing was crazy. Look at this. [chuckles] (Rose) Hello? Hi, Rose, it's me. Is everything okay? No, everything is not okay. Have you heard from her? No. Rose, it's been two weeks What the fuck's going on? What did you do, Liam? I didn't do anything. Something must've happened. I swear to God, I didn't do anything. You must've said something. I didn't say anything. I thought we were doing fine. And then she just, I mean-- I-I know you and Chance will be fine without me. What am I supposed to tell Chance? Just tell him that you went to San Diego. If she does, could you ask her to call me at least? You know I will. You take it easy, Liam. Thanks, Rose. I appreciate it. Call me if you hear anything. Yeah, all right. Bye. [kids laughing] (kid) Actually, you know, it was-- Hey. Where have you guys been? We were at the beach. You better be careful. You're gonna kill yourselves like that. Come here. There you go. All right. Give me a couple. Left. All right, all right. Beat. Beat. Can we see the new move? Okay, okay. Good. Let's get something to eat. Come on. Ouch. Hey. Dad, he hit a rock when he jumped in the water. Please, don't hurt my dad. Are you sore back here? No, it's okay. Son of a bitch. Dad! Dad! You boys stay right there. [angry voice] Come here. I'll get you. [man groaning] [woman shouts] [woman cries] [shouting] Why the fuck have you killed him? [shouting] I need some help! I need some help! He'll never hurt you again. Fucking get away from my son. You're fucking done. You'll fucking pay for this. I swear to God ! [sirens wailing] [all shouting] Get up. Get up. Get up. Somebody clean up this garbage. That's Bookman. He took me under his wing. He kept me out of the shit details while he trained me to fight. When I was ready, he set up the fights that he and the guards ran in the boiler room. My dad taught me to box, but Bookman taught me to fight. He was the closest thing to a friend that I had. Fucking off somewhere. Davis! [muffled screams] AW. Saving Bookman cost me eight stitches, but it bought me five years. In a couple of months, finally I get to go home. Saying goodbye was harder than I thought. He said we'd stay in touch. But I think we both knew we wouldn't. [music playing] [thump] Sue? Are you all right? I'll be right there. Don't move. Ha-ha. Like you can. Okay, roll over. Jesus, Mary and Saint. Use your arm ! Push, push ! Let's just stay like this, Rose. God ! I'm sorry, Rose. Aw, Jesus! Where's your stuff? Right below you. Thank you. Sue. If you wanna go on killing yourself, that's fine. Would you stop including me? Do you think Chance, he'll stay here with you? No. Chance always has some place to stay. It's just the wrong place, that's all. Sounds like most of the men I've known. I'm making you somethin'. Oh. What color is it? Green. You'll love it. Why don't you move your fucking bike? Why don't you come over here and make me? Fuck you. Hey, fuck you. No, fuck you. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no! Fuck you ! No, fuck you. Piece of shit. [laughing] Oh, my God. Ready for a rematch? Yeah, I can give you a fucking head start. Is the pier okay with you? How does it feel to have something big between your legs, huh? Why don't you lick me? Are you good? My fucking shrink's got me on a new one now. Gravi-sil. Ugh. So, what do you wanna do first, man? I gotta go see Kat. See where I stand. Have you seen her? She hasn't been around much since you've been gone. Where is she staying? Down by the docks. Eddie put 'em up. One of his places. Them? I mean her. Hey. I missed you so much. I missed you, too. [muffled conversation] Hail Hitler. I told you not to say that shit. What's the word on my son? He's out. He was released this morning. I don't wanna be out of line. Some of the men think it might be a good idea to lean on him. Look. I mean, he did stop a head on the marked nigger. If anyone in the brim talks or even thinks of putting hurt on my blood, you are going to tell me. Hm? Correct? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Go change your pants. You're a fucking disgrace. [knocking on door] Who the fuck are you? (Kat) Who is it? Hey, Kat. [sighs] August, this is your daddy. He's been away for a long time and now he's back. That's funny, Kat. Whose kid is it? Look, I didn't wanna tell you when you were on the inside, okay? [sighs] Uh, look, I'm gonna go get a drink or two And why don't you get to know your kid? I'll be back later. Don't you wanna catch up? Kat, come on. You can't just leave me with this kid. Whose kid is it? [whispers] Oh, Jesus. I only wanna do this if they throw down. Hard and bloody, huh? Well the Lt say they're gonna bust him and bring him for questioning? Well, Lts have a tendency to forget. Every once in a while in the field, things don't go that smoothly. I wanna make sure things are gonna be cool. Benny, Benny, what you have to make sure of in your heart is that you trust me, okay? That you trust us. You're the new kid here. All right? So let's get that straight. You have to trust me. Okay? [whispers] All right. Okay? Okay. Who's throwing the switch? Put the gun down. Put the gun down, motherfucker! What, a black? Dan. Let me talk to MC nigger here for a second. Are you okay? Fuck you, man. Arrest me so I can call my fucking lawyer. [groans] Shit! Come on ! Shut the fuck up! Shut up! This is bullshit. Watch my fucking back. Sorry. Now, where is it? If I talk, I walk. If you talk, I'll let you walk. Yeah. Clean and free of nothin'. You got it. Now, where is it? It's right there. Fuck me. Well, that is a lot of cocaine. Rath, let's call it in, man. Your name is Rath? I heard about you. Yeah? What you hear? Heard you was a fucking faggot. That's right. A crooked cop, fucking faggot. I'll never have any kind of life if I stay here. I just can't do it anymore. You know, Eddie was right. Like father, like son. Oh, what do you mean Eddie's right? Have you been fucking Eddie to pass the time? [man shouting] Hey, Kat. Un-fucking-believable. What the fuck am I suppose to do, Kat? You have to take the kid with you. No, no. I've been waiting too long for this. You know, you're such a selfish bitch. You haven't changed, either. Why don't you give me some time to catch up-- Time? You had five years. You think you got it rough? I've been trying to stay alive for the last five years. Don't talk to me about time! Your stuff's over there. Okay? Here are your letters. I never read them. Take care of him, okay? Mommy loves you, okay? You be a good boy. You're gonna stay with daddy for a while. Be a good boy. Okay. Kat, Kat, let's just talk about this. Don't touch me. Let's just talk-- Let's just talk about this. I-I can't raise that thing on my own. I did. Maybe you'll grow up this time, huh? Grow up? Kat, why don't you--Look who's fucking walking out now, huh? Fuck! Fucking kidding me. You know, your mom is a real fucking bitch, you know that? Un-fucking-believable. What? Son of a bitch. Fucking bitch. Just play. Bring it to--Shut up. Play 2-5-1. Play it 3-1-7. Take it. 2-5-1 in G-flat, man. Stop trying to reinvent the wheel, man. You can't play it, lay out. One, two, A one-- A'right, take five. And another thing, Rico, when I say dress rehearsal, it means dress rehearsal. If you wanna wear denims, go get a gig at a rodeo, brother. What's that shirt? I don't give a fuck if you like it or not. Go get a gig with Don Ho. Look at this. look at this. Look at you, man. Give me some love. Five years ain't done you no harm at all, man. If you were a chick, well. Show your dad how to hug, Chico. Come on. Give an aging hipster a big kiss. Willow! Listen, I gotta talk to your daddy. I'm gonna put you in the hands of a very beautiful girl. You gotta be nice. Willow! Come and take care of Chance's face. And another thing. That motherfucker comes in here with blue jeans, I'm gonna-- I don't give a shit if he blows Beethoven's Ninth out of his butt. You fire him. Do you hear me? OK, I got it. Let's go, Chance. We'll be back, Chico. Stay here. So, Chance, your boy Beat's been blowing some very lame changes. He tell you about his situation with me? No, what situation? I'm holding his marker for 50 K. Jesus, Eddie. That you're gonna look after him, that'll put him in debt the rest of his life. What do you want me to do? Sleep under his bed, hold his hands, serve him cookies and cream? The boy's an adult, Chance. Besides, bad jazz that Kat blows is a solo, baby. I can't help if anybody lies now with dogs. This is a little somethin' the girls put together for August. Take it. About $ 1,000. Take it, take it. Everybody knows your old lady split on you. Down to business. The word is that you got pretty tough in the joint. Anyway, that's the buzz cuz. So, this is a new cat, Axel. Real thug. And everybody digs. I wanna put you together with Axel, bare knuckles. Odds will be sky high, high as the moon, baby. High as a Chinaman in Beijing. Now, you do this, we get the things straight with Beat and put a little gin in our pockets. What do you say? You're fucking kill me, Eddie. You're really fucking kill me. How am I supposed to get ahead when I got 50 grand stacked against me from you? 'Cause I got a plan, man. Before we talk about your little plan, you wanna talk about how you fucked my girl while I was gone? I'll come over there and kick your nasty old ass. Stop the bullshit. I fucking know it. I own this club. She worked here. I fucked everybody worked here. Once. It's like punching a time card, baby. Besides, you ain't gonna put a hurt on my ass. Because, A: you love me. And B : you need me like you always need me. You got a place I can crash? Absolutely. You can stay at Kat's crib. I own the building. It's the least I can do. What's the catch? Catch? There Ain't no catch. Just think about this fight, baby. I'll think about it. You know what, Eddie? I would like to do something with my life other then fight and deal drugs. Why? Mommy, mommy, mommy! Mommy, mommy! What? What? Fuck kid, what? May I have some water? Yeah. A glass of water. Here. Thank you, Daddy. Can you go back to sleep now? Yes. Mommy isn't coming back, is she? No. But, hey, it is time for you to go to sleep. So, lie back down there and I'm gonna tell you a story, okay? Just try to close your eyes. [knocking on door] Hi. Hi. I just heard you guys moving in and I just wanted to say hello. I'm, uh, Chance. I'm Pearl. Pearl ! Hi, hot shot. How you doing? So you know the kid, huh? Oh, yeah. Um, I would watch him at Eddie's when Kat wasn't around, which was most of the time. Right, right. You want a soda? Yeah, sure! Hey, why don't you run and give Pearl a soda? Please. Thank you. Take a seat. Okay. So, how long have you been here? Um, a year. Cheap rent. Yeah, yeah. It's just temporary for me till I figure out what I'm gonna do next. Funny. That's what I said. Didn't mean it to sound like that. It's okay. Thanks! So, you must be one of Eddie's girls, right? No, I am not one of Eddie's girls. You? One of Eddie's girls? No. No, I meant, are you friends with him? Not exactly. You? Not exactly. I should go. I'll see you guys around. Feel free to go. You don't have to rush off. I-I should. Thanks for the soda. Yeah. God bless you ! Okay, bye. Thanks. Wow. Hey, what's up? Hey, Sonny. M ind if I come in? Yeah, come on in. How are you doin', brother? All right. You got some business? Just a couple of things. Contract got played, so that's one less name in the hat. And, uh, your boy, he's gone. Yeah, that was old business. Not my call. What else do you got? Listen, man, I've been giving this a lot of thought, all right? Your son. If we give him control over San Pedro, and with his network, all the problem I foresee is, we can keep in the product store to keep up with the demand. What do you think? No. You know, I would think that you would want your son to have a post as opposed to being in an early grave. No one goes near my son. End of story. Listen. You know, when I go through out there, taking out my ass here for you, it's like covering for your ass, okay? You're making us all look fucking bad. Making who look bad? Hm? We got a problem here, Sonny? No, I ain't got no problem. You're the boss. I ain't got no problem. [tires screech] [chuckles] It's been so long I don't even know how to say hey. Hey, I got some lunch for us. Let's go grab something to eat. I'm late for an appointment. [honks horn] That appointment you got with Ted, that's been canceled. See, I had Ted take you off the computer, so now you don't have to check in with Ted. You have to check in with me. Consider this your first check-in. [honks horn] Get in the fucking car. Man, you look good. That port over there, that's where I get a lot of my stuff coming from the last five years. I kinda own this place. I don't have to pay for parking. So, I heard you won some pretty big fights inside. Still fighting dirty? I should ask you the same question. Listen, I got merchandise, man. I-I don't wanna know. I'm not interested. Chance, you gotta start over, man. I mean, you gotta have money. You got- you got a boy to feed. How the fuck do you know I have a kid? How about your daddy, you talk to him? Why? Why? He just became one of the heads of the Aryans, that's why. So? So? He's under tremendous pressure to bring you into the fold. And why fuck would I care? Because I have a deal pending with the Aryans and it might help solve the situation. Because let me tell you, if the Aryans lose control of the prison drug trade, your dad's reign of the top is gonna be one of the shortest in history. I'll show you something. Come on. Leshaun. Hey, man, this is Chance. Chance, Leshaun. Leshaun, Chance. That's fucked up. Leshaun here and the Bloods were trying to hoard in the Aryans turf. Bookman was their liaison inside. It was brave shit of you, man, jumping for him like that. He's my friend. I'm your friend. Friends don't let friends do five fucking years. Are you blaming me for you getting set up? Is that what all this fucking attitude is about? I had to deal with the DA. Beat was supposed to go down, not you. You didn't have to put yourself under the bus. It's your bullshit sense of loyalty that locked you up, not me. You talk to me about fucking loyalty? Beat was stealing from me. From us. Beat wanted what he deserved. What was that? More. Well, I got more. I got 25 keys. We gotta move them right away. It's a big one, Chance. We can retire on this and we can fucking go to the South Pacific. We can spend the rest of our lives tanning and eating fucking mangoes. Took five long years to think about you alright. Five very long fucking years. Chance, let me drive you back. I'll walk. Chance! Fuck. [inmates whistling] (inmate) Fine fucking cop and San Pedro's. [inmates' mixed voices] I heard about your new post. Mazel tov. I'm here about your son. And considering your new post and my relationship with Chance. Your relationship? Yea, we're, um...close. I'm offering you the opportunity to help Chance start over, and to flex your new muscles, huh? I got a lot of product that I gotta move right away. About 25 kilos. That's interesting. The word is 25 keys just got ripped from the Bloods. Really? Well, I don't do business with niggers. Like it showed up on your doorstep. Liam, you don't want the Aryans to find out that you passed on this deal. It's bad business. Fucking son of a bitch. All right, have it your way, asshole. That guard Chance saved was marked to go down. By who? ABs in Riverside. Bookman was up and moved dope for the Bloods in Long Park. And your point? My point is, you fuck with Chance, I drop a photo of you for circulation. Your name goes in the hat. You think you're fucking bulletproof in here, huh? I can have you shipped and stripped in about six fucking minutes, and somewhere where the Aryans don't have as much suck as they got here. Fuck you. Fuck you ! Liam, I'm just trying to tell you that if you wanna keep your new post, you gotta consider doing business with me. Huh? Huh? You wanna stay alive? You better look every each way before you cross me. Okay. (Eddie) And one, two, three, four. You go to my head  Bless me. And you linger like A haunting refrain  That's beautiful. And I find you Spinning round I n my brain  Yeah, Baby. Like the bubbles in A glass of champagne  Less piano is beautiful for a beautiful baby. One more time here. You go to my head  Like a sip Of sparkling Burgundy brew  Beautiful, beautiful. And I find the Very mention of you  Like the kicker I n a julep or two  Hey, baby. [applauses] Beautiful, baby. That is beautiful ! Take five, man. Take ten. A'right, here, uh-- You gonna fight Axel? I haven't decided, yet. Eddie said it can be more than 50. Just do it. You're gonna like to fight this guy. I'm telling you. How do you know? You've been seeing this guy? Hey, Pearl. Wow, you sounded good. You have a great voice. It's all right. Thanks. No, it's good. How about I take you to dinner? I don't think that's a good idea. Plus, who's gonna watch August? Well. Are you kidding? No, God, no fucking way. It's okay. He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Right, Beat? Right, Beat? Yes. I'll think about it. You're gonna think about it? Yeah. How is it going? Good. Well. Look at me. She's not coming back. Are you gonna go see your dad? Why do you bring up the heavy shit, huh? Are you gonna go see your daddy? I don't--I-I- I don't know. I don't know. I saw him. You saw him. When? I saw him. When did you go see him? Last year. The fucking shrink thought it would be a good idea to stop the nightmares. Chance? He doesn't like me. Did you mean it? Mean it? Did you mean to kill him? I wanted him to stop hurting you. [whispers] I was so scared of him. You know your father was a very sick man. I also know that you were nothing like him. You are nothing like him. You're good. I don't feel that way. Come here. You are more of a dad to me than that fuck ever was. Listen to me. Put all that shit behind you. Okay? You bring that shit up right now. Debbie. Fucking bitch. [mixed dialog] Are you fucking kidding me? Are you serious? You know what? I will take August home. No, no, no, no. Come join us. Fuck you. Enjoy your boyfriend, faggot. Pearl, August is fine. He has a coloring book. I taught him to color between the lines. Come here. Come here, faggot. Looks like it's you and me tonight. What do you feel like doing? I don't know. Are you hungry? [knocking on door] Come in. What the fuck do you want from me, Chance? What do you mean? I mean what is your agenda? I-I'd just like, I just came to-- You just what? I just came-- Oh, you-you want this? Is that what you want? Hm? Well, then just get over here and do it. Stop talking. Just get over here and do it. I just came to-- You just what? You just wanna fuck me like everybody else! Get over here and do it. Be a man. Get over here and do it. Come on ! Get it over with ! I just came to apologize. Where are your fucking keys? Take them. You know what? I am so sick of you so called men who wanna do what the fuck they want. Get out! Listen, I don't know what you've been through with other men, but I'm not them. I'd like to take you to dinner. What do you think? I don't think it's a good idea. Now we're full of shit. Come on, it's just dinner. Take me on your bike. Deal. Say goodbye to Pearl. Who's there? Cocksucker, I got a gun. Who the fuck is there? Rosie, Rosie, Rosie. It's me. Put that piece away. What took you so long? Go to prison for five years. Shit stacks up. You going to bust my balls or give me some loving. Oh ! [laughs] Who did you bring with you? Rose, I would like for you to meet August. This is my son. Did you say this is your son? August, give me your hand. I'm gonna use my other hand so I can see what you look like, okay? Well, you want a beer? You know I do. I got something for you, too, August. The place looks great. Thanks. I've been doing a lot of decorating. Here you go, August. Okay. [chuckles] Nice. Ah, what a sound. Wait, one. Two. Shit! I can still drink you under the board. That you can. What the hell is going on here, Rose. You gonna introduce me? Sorry. Chance, August, this is Sue, my neighbor and my best friend. Hey, Chance. Hey, Sue. Sorry about the company you have to keep. It wouldn't be so bad if she'd just hop in bed every once in a while. She's really hot for me. I don't blame her. I'll see what I can do to help you out. Thank you. Look at these. This is blooming cactus. Shit! Anyway, wait. I've been collecting them, I don't know why. They're just dangerous and beautiful, and I love them. I want you to touch them. You want me to touch them? Yes. Put your fingers on them. Touch it. Squish it really hard. Ah, fuck. I'm bleeding here, Rosie. Hey. Hey, what about some more beer? It's best two out of three. All right, I'll get you a band aid. Hey, you wanna watch some TV? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Come on in and watch the tube. Come here. Oh, honey. Here. Why didn't you call me sooner? [laughs] Sit down. Don't fall. I don't wanna take your ass to the hospital. Sue what are you drinking? You guys go ahead. I'll see you later. You got a boy. I don't know what I'm gonna do with him though. [growling] Fucking messy nigger. You want a foot? [barks and growls] I think we're out of Leshaun. There's no more Leshaun. (man) Hi, Rose. Hey, Ken. Hey, Annie. Is he sleeping? Yeah, he's crashed up on the couch. You want a smoke? Smoke. Have you talked to your father? No. You know, he actually wrote me a couple of times through the years. Yeah, well, I don't really give a shit about him. Yes, you do. When you're through trying to convince yourself that you're never gonna be him, well. Those mistakes that he made and continues to make, he's gotta survive. Those mistakes as you call 'em, fucked all our lives up. What would you have done in his shoes? Don't answer me. Just think about it. Have you heard from your mother? No. Not in a long time. She's just like Kat. A whore who ran away. Besides, you're my mom. Don't you talk that way about her. She's your mother, and more importantly that she's my sister. What is it? What-what makes you think you're so much better than everybody? I know. I know what you do, mister drug boy. You gotta go see him. Would you mind watching August for a while? You know, I think that's a hell of an idea. He can drink Red Bull and I'll teach him how to play cards in the porch. You take all the time you need. (Eddie) Okay, hipsters and chipsters. and todos el mundo. Ready to open a jump? Don't worry about the scratch. It's in the Good Book. And remember the rules. The rules are, there ain't no rules. Hit it. [cheering] Well, that didn't quite work out, did it? It's better this way. Eddie, now you set up a re-match and we'll make some serious money. Serious money? You're gonna pick up a fight on the Wall Street Journal. There's no serious money. That globe's in a shit. Everybody wants the big dig. No wanna lickety split. Real match is gonna take 40 days and 40 nights. Meanwhile, I need my scratch so the cat in front of line gets his scratch. So come manana. I don't see some loot and scoot. Somebody's gonna get their young ass scaled, and it ain't gonna be mine 'cause my ass is ancient. No. No? Is that the existential no, or does that refer to something specifically I just said? I'm fucking done. Done? While you were well done right here, motherfucker, I gave you a home. I gave you the life. You were happy with the scratch we made. But you wanted the flash and dash. You wanted the razzle dazzle, some twisted punk DEA agent, and you get five long hard time. And while your absolutely certifiable girlfriend with that stupid gash is trying to find herself, who the fuck was taking care of your face? Huh? Who's taking care of your son? Let me give you the facts of life here, brother. You show up and you pay up. Dig it. Okay. Eddie, it's no problem. Would you shut the fuck up? What do you mean no problem? No problem. That's a sentence. That's where a period goes. (woman) Report from Beijing is on the phone. (Beat) Every fucking night? [jumbled voices] Talk to Eddie, you fuck. The guards fucking rained down on me. Are you fucking crazy? It's gonna be smooth with this run. I'm telling you. Eddie is up our asses. Okay? All that we have to do is make a few calls to the old gang, and you and I we can move this little brother in no time. Where did you get it? Beat, where the fuck did you get this? The less you know, the better. All right? Listen to me. This gives me a way to make up to you for, for the last time, you know. You didn't, you didn't roll on me and I owe you fucking forever for that, okay? Do you know the definition of insanity? Dude, that is a stupid question to post in me, man. It's doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. Who said that? My old man. How long has it been? Ten years? Eleven. And what are you doing with yourself? You know, this and that. You clean? Yeah. Good. You? As the driven snow. I thought I told you never to come back here. Yeah, you did. Rath told me you cut a deal with him. I never did a thing for that twisted fuck. You stay away from him. He's not gonna last. So, I got a kid now. His name's August. How old is he? Five. Sometimes he fucking looks at me. I don't know what the fuck he wants. That sounds familiar. You know, I have met this new girl. Yeah? What's she like? She's telling me. It gets better. Black. Jesus Christ, man. If you haven't given me enough troubles. Holy shit. I got to go. Guard. Housekeeping. (Beat) Leave me the fuck alone. What's going on, pal? What's up, man? Where are your pills? I don't want anymore fucking pills. Just wanna be fucking normal. I don't wanna take anymore pills. You gotta take your pills, man. Yeah, but when I take them, I don't get to feel anything ! And if I don't take them, what I feel is too fucking much. I'm so sorry. I though I could let off the medication. Now you're back, but you're just-you're gonna leave me again. Look at me. Look at me. If I go, you go. You understand? Sure. Yeah. Sure. Is everything else alright? Fine, man. I'm fine. I just need your help. I can't--I can't do this alone. You're not alone. I'm here. We just gotta me smart. We gotta make the right moves. I know. I know. I am, after this load, we're done. I promise. Yeah. I'm sorry. [no audible dialog] [whistles] My dad was pushing a lid open with the Aryans making a deal with the Bloods. I didn't know it then, but my dad made the deal to protect me. That sure pissed off Sonny, who was next in line under my dad. [no audible dialog] How did it go? You still got all your fingers and toes? For years I practiced what I would say to him. I didn't say any of it. You said it all just by showing up. He loves you. Just like you love August, only you don't know it, yet. What do you mean? What do you mean? What am I gonna do? I mean, I-I'm a dealer. No. You were a dealer. You dealt drugs. That's in the past. That's not who you are. Yeah, but that's all know how to do. It's what I'm good at. When you were a kid, what did you wanna be? What was like your dream? I don't know. I always thought that I would work by the docks like my old man. Oh, that's perfect. That is so perfect. There is lots of water where we're going. Lots of boats. Yes! Boats? You want me to go to the South? Yes, please! I'm in. As long as I'm with you, I don't care where I'm at. Oh, when? When do you wanna go? Now. Yes. We could enjoy it sitting out here. No, come on, seriously. There's a few things I gotta take care of, but then I'm all yours. I'm still in it. Okay, I know you've been involved with some shady shit in the past. That's all behind you, right? You've got nothing to worry about. Okay. Nothing to worry about. Come on, motherfucker. Go. Come on. [shouts] What the fuck do you guys want? August, run ! Run ! (man) Nine-one-one. What is your emergency? (Rath) Why do you make me keep doing this to you? My money isn't in Chance's apartment. Where is my fucking money? Where is it? I don't fucking know, man. I don't know. Tell me where it is. [crying] I don't know. I don't know. Okay. All right. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right. All right. I just--I-I lose my patience sometimes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Tell where my fucking son is. I'm not fucking around. I don't know where your fucking kid is. Why in the fuck would you think I know where your kid is? 'Cause of the money we fucking owe you. It ain't that much fucking money, man. I got a kid of my own. You know that. I don't take kids. Go ahead and shoot me, motherfucker. Runs in the gene pool, don't it? Christ. I need your help, Eddie. What? I need your fucking help. While you are sitting there thinking about this stuff, I want you to run these changes by Beat, hm? See what he has to say about this shit. Give me the rest of my money. Here's the money I owe you. I'm done fighting for good. You piece of shit! Come on. Come on ! You like that? Don't you? [gunshot] [groans] (Eddie) I will tell you about my kid. It's just some girl I knew from home and left me with a kid and disappeared. I didn't think there was much I could do for him so I put him in a home for the retarded. But there was hell of a lot I could've done for him. By the time I realized that, he was gone. Died at eight years old. Alone. I n some home. When your flesh and blood needs you, man, and you cut for the tall grass, everything else just seems like some farce. So, if you don't wanna fight more, Chance, okay, that's cool by me. But if you cut and run, if you cut for the tall grass, take your boy with you. It's safe there. That's all anybody wants. To be safe. Thanks, Eddie. Funny how it goes. Oh, no. No. [whispers] Oh, God. Hey. [whispers] Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. I'm here. Yeah. Take my hand. Okay. [groans] Rath took August. He's a son of a bitch. Let go. You're okay now. You're okay. Where's my son? I got him. I got him. I want my son. Okay, I'll get him. I'll get him. Every body settle down, okay? It's all cool. All I want is the money that you and Beat skimmed from me. That's it. You give me my money, I'll give you back your son. Okay? I'm not giving you shit. You owe me. Five fucking years you owe me. What do you think I'm doing? I'm setting all this up. It's for you, it's for us. It's what we've always wanted. That's what you fucking wanted. I just wanted something for myself. I wanted you to have things for yourself, man. Not unless I owed you for it. That's not true. Jesus Christ! Okay. Settle the fuck down. We're okay. We're okay. Do you think I care about this? This life? I don't care about any of this. I just care about you. (thug) Boss, just let me shoot this asshole. Don't look at him, don't look at him. Look at me. I don't care about these guys. You see? I just want what's best for us. I just want my son. Okay. I'll get him. Here we go August. Come on, your dad's here. Are you okay, buddy? Of course he's okay. I wouldn't lie to you. It's all right, man. I can't do this anymore. You don't have to. You don't have to. I just wanna give him a better life. And I don't want this. I don't want the drugs, I don't want the fighting. Okay. Okay. Listen, I'll set it up for us. We can go anywhere we want now, okay? Anywhere in the world. Okay. I got you now. Yeah. Yeah? Okay? Okay? Okay. [yells] Motherfucker. I'm gonna fucking kill you. You fucking killed Beat so I'm gonna make you pay. I didn't kill him. [inaudible] [shouts] [cries] [shouts] Twice in 11 years. Meet your grandson. August. Hey. What the hell happened to you? Rath's men. Kidnapped August, almost killed Pearl. I found out Beat was running with Rath. It was too late. Beat's dead. Hey, August, who is our favorite superhero? Aquaman. Why fucking Aquaman? Did you hear me? Yeah. Not in front of the kid. Hey, Keyes, take August down to the other room. See if you can find him a Silver Surfer comic. But I hate Silver surfer. Well, I hate fucking Aquaman. Go outside, all right, buddy? I'll be out there in a minute. Oh, that's nice. Did you kill him? No. Why the fuck not? 'Cause I wanted to make the right fucking decision for once in my life. Sometimes your right fucking decision is the wrong decision. Like you know the fucking difference? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I never should've come here. Sit your ass right back there. Fuck you ! You're the one who told me that I had a choice. This time I made the right fucking choice. I chose to end up here the rest of my life and I chose my fucking son. Do you think I wanted this? Huh? You think I wanted this shit? I wanted to be with you. It just didn't work out. After all these fucking years, it just didn't work out? What the fuck is that? I think about punching that fucking guys lights out, I think about crushing that motherfucker skull every day of my fucking life! What do you want me to say? I want you to say you're fucking sorry you did it. Yeah, well, I can't. I cannot undo what I did. Why did you fucking do it? Why did you fucking do it? He was raping Beat. He was raping him ! Can I ask you somethin'? Sure. Remember that day? You whispered something in my ear. What did you say? You need anything? Not anymore. Tell your grandpa bye. Bye, August. You take care of each other. All right? Good. [no audible dialog] I'm making a presentation now. Pearl, this is for you. This is some--Ouch ! Shit. Would you like a band aid? Yeah. Thank you. All right, gang, we gotta get on the road. Come here. I'm gonna miss you. Is there anything I can do for you, before I leave? You just take care of your family. (Sue) I can teach your girl friend here. I got a beer. Yeah, no kidding. Come on, get out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Go on. Go on. Get going. We're going to set up that, Rose. Okay, go on. To Chance. One thousand one, one thousand two. [laughs] What's up? Phone call. Yeah? From who? It's your son, I think. All right. I'm shaking it, boss, I'm shaking it. It's always a tie by this weekend. Ugh. It's a mistake. What's the spread? Twelve. Who you like? Anyone. What is the opener? Sixty-five. I'll put 500 on the other. Five hundred? Yeah. All right. Your call's in 18. All right, on three. One, two, three. Hey, Chance. Hey, Liam. Took a vote on you and that cocksucking nigger loving son of yours. You're gonna pull me down, I'm gonna fold your hands. That's coming. I promise you. Relax now. [shouts] Redemption time, nigger loving. Piece of shit. Baby. The sins of the father. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. (Chance) I had a secret treasure chest. Where is it? We used to come down here when we were kids. It's right here, buddy. All right. Thanks Partner. We'll see you. You get to hold it. Let's go. Strange things happens when the tide falls. What you came to know, drifts away. Once fallen doesn't mean forever. We were head to New Orleans to live with Pearl's family. That's were we'd all get start over. It turned out moving on wasn't the hard part. In the end, the hard part was saying goodbye.
