Thee enemy hast surrounded us and break'th our lines. Our forces hast take'th heavy casualties and thus dying in droves. If this keep'th up'th I think'th we will definitely be defeat'th. Why the hell are you talking like that? So lame. Are you from the dark ages?! Private Mark is injured. Hey Mark! Ouch... How bad is it, doc? You'll be okay. You just sprained your leg. Sprained my leg?! Damn! You moan like you're in heat! Am I going to make it back home to Phrakhanong? Nak, my wife probably gave birth already. This can't be the end of the line for us? Damn it! Don't give up! Remember "300" The Battle of Thermopylae? King Leonidas Stelios They were all outnumberd and outgunned. Hmmmmm But in the end everybody died, right? Oh Sorry I never got to the end. Then think of "Rocky" Rocky Road? It's yummy! Where is it? Where is it? Gosh How about the "Last Samurai" During his final battle, he fought so hard his blade shattered. He didn't even think of giving up. Here we still have our swords all our arms and legs. Asshole! Sorry! Sorry! Just all our swords then. Do we not have a fighting chance? Yeah! Kill them! Kill them! Shit They've got guns. I forgot. Ouch.. Are you okay, Mark? Hey Shin since we are all going to die anyways. Can I ask you something? What's with the hair? When I was little there was a bubonic plague outbreak. I almost died. So my mother swore to God if I survived I would keep this hairdo for the rest of my life. I rather die than live with that ugly topknot hairdo. Look like a dog's ankle bunion. What about yours? I'm a trend setter. Stop shooting already! Mark, do you have any last words? No I don't. No matter what I will make it back to see my wife and baby. I will not allow myself to die here. Nor will all of you. Pee Mak... Pee Mak... Pee Mak... Why did you come out? Go inside. Hurry. Pee Mak... Pee Mak... Pee Mak... Pee Mak... Too many people playing. I won't deal you in. Why not. No cash, no play. Get on with it. Are you going to shuffle until dawn? Why don't you go put on a card show. Is your dad David Blaine? Hurry up. Come on. Hey what's this? A Natural 9 Shit! I got 0 What? I got 1, pay UP- What's wrong? The wound hurts? I am fine. I can't believe that you survived. Man you must be invincible. I am grateful to all of you for bringing me back here. We are the one who should be grateful. Without you Mark, we would be dead already. Actually you should pronounce my name as... "MARK" with the K in the end. Huh? M arrrrk? Forget it. Just call me "Mak" then. The only person who calls me "Mark" is my daddy. But he's back to the United States of America with the missionaries. Everyone in my village calls me Mak. WTF? Hey guys we made it to Phrakhanong. We're here? Finally. Where is everybody? Thank you. You're welcome Nak Nak Nak honey I'm back. Nak ls Nak taking a dump? Hey Nak Where were you? I was really worried. I thought I would never see you again. Don't cry baby. You won't look handsome. You know when I was at war I missed you so much. I missed you a lot. I missed you soooo much! I missed you more than anyone in whole world. Man, Mak is whipped! Baby, did you miss me at all? No Why not? You don't love me anymore? You crazy. Of course, I do. You're mean. Don't joke like that. Isn't that special? Nak, what about our baby? He's playing over there. Where? Let daddy see. Wow he is handsome just like his daddy. You know I gave him your favorite name. Really, Nak? "Dang" Dang, my boy.)'- What's so cool about the name Dang? Go figure. My servant has a cooler name. Hey you GUYS This is my wife, Nak. Hello there. Nak, these are my friends This is Aey Ter, Puak and that's Shin. And what're you guys going to do now? I guess tonight will be difficult to find a boat. We will stay here for a night. Why just one night? You all can stay here until the war is over. The house opposite to us has been empty since my aunty passed away. There's a boat for you to use too. Geez His aunt won't haunt us? She will haunt you until your hair falls out. We will stay here for a night. Don't want to be a bother. Hey They are welcoming us and you just turn them down? You have no manners, Aey. Right? Mak's wife is so damn beautiful. Hey... Careful that's our friend's wife. You know I am a bad soldier. How come? When I was at war I never thought of Siam my country. All I thought about was you. This soldier should be executed by a firing squad. Yes You should be. You know I waited for you at the pier every day. I am here now. I promise you I won't go anywhere anymore. Hey Nak our house has fireflies too? Wow so beautiful. That's a Krasue ghost. What? Nak Why are you joking with me like that? You know I am really scared of ghosts. What are you looking for? I will wear my Buddha amulet. The doctor took it off when they bandaged me. Gosh There's a lot of blood on it. Just put it away for now and I will clean it later. Okay My wife is the nicest person in Siam. And you smell great too. At this temple... There are seven palm trees. The Hill Myna is out but has not returned. Chirping Chirping Chirping Hey guys look. They aren't scared of people. Cute huh. Yeah. So cute. Cute my ass! Damn. Why do you have to be animal lover this early! Can't you see we are all still trying to sleep? How can anybody sleep with you chirping. And this damn bird eating. Go go go, go eat somewhere else. Go away. Fly away out of my house. Hey! Wake up you guys. You're here early. Any later the market will close. What's on the boat? The bodies of soldier who died in the war. The cemetery is all full. So we must return the bodies back to their families for burial. Hey keep rowing. Geez. Snakehead fish. Fresh! Small and big. We have it. Wow Today the market is very crowded. Hello. Snacks and desserts? We got cookies too. Aunty Nim May I have 2 cookies and 2 of those snacks? Mak. Yes? We're all out! Damn it. We won't get to eat any. Uncle Aum. Uncle Aum. Mak I want to buy some fish for Nak. Not for sale. Today's a Buddhist holy day. I am releasing them. Sathu. Go go go. Don't be in the way. Do you think that's a merit? What got into him? Liquor shop Aunty Priek... Aunty Priek Wake up. You have customers. Aunty Priek You don't remember me? Do you have any job, I can do? No Gosh How many staffs do you think we need for a small liquor store? You think I need salesperson? Mixologist? Waitress? Hostess? Bartender? Dishwasher? Bus boy? I got them all. Please drink up. She's even got an escort. Very good. You look familiar. I am Mak. I just got back from the war. If I didn't meet Nak first, I'd probably hit on you. You are looking good. As pretty as your ghost! You really don't know Mak? If you want to know Bend down and look between the legs and you'll see that Nak and your kid are... Mom Shush Ping You're drunk. Go rest. Mom lam not drunk. Why won't you let me go? I'm not drunk. Go. Get up. I'm sorry. When she is drunk she talks nonsense. Get inside. Nak! Nak! Nak! Let her come. I'm not scared! Nak... Let her come. What's wrong with her? Everyone is acting weird, don't you think? Yeah. What did aunty Priek mean anyway? Why do you have to look between the legs? Yoga exercise? My mom once told me if you look between the legs you can tell if they're ghosts. You mean... Nak is a ghost? That's crazy She's too hot to be a ghost. Right. Beautiful like that Even if she is a ghost I would still have her. Why did Aunty Priek talk to Mak like that? Because she was wasted. So everything she says is nonsense. Where the heck is Mak? How come he isn't here drinking with us? Gosh, Aey you're spilling all the booze. You go and get Mak here. Hurry UP- Why me? Because you drank the least. It's been over an hour and you can't even down one glass. That's right. We are all drunk. So just go. Oops my bad. Hey don't waste it. Hurry up. Mak! Mak! Nak, is Mak here? Hey Shin. Nak. Is Mak here? He's sleeping. I will wake him for you. Please come in first. Where is Dang? Nak are you ok? You ran out of coconut husks? Shin! What the heck is wrong with you? Puak. Slap me please? That's hard. You told me to. Where the heck is Mak? How come he isn't here drinking with us? Gosh Aey You're spilling all the booze. Shit. Dj vu. What do you mean dj vu? You go and get Mak here. Hurry up. No, why me? What are you scared of? If Nak is really a ghost, then seduce her. There's no such things as ghosts. You want to bet? You won't get me this time. The drums of war sound off like rolling thunder as we set out to protect our homeland. Our thirst for battle is great even though there are no elephants ride. Dusk fills my emptiness with thoughts of love for my beautiful dearest. Roused to the point of release I raise my white flag in sweet surrender. I bust a rag out and just polish the sword. Yay! What's with you, Shin? Where is Mak? Nak is a ghost! Nak is really a ghost! What are you babbling about? If you're drunk, go vomit somewhere else. Seriously. I went up to Mak's house. His house looks run-down and abandoned. Maybe Nak is feeling lazy. But the crib was swinging by itself. Maybe there's a strong breeze. You are imagining things. I wasn't! I saw Nak upstairs but she was able to reach to the ground to grab a lime. Maybe one of her arms is longer than the other? Didn't you know our arms are not exactly the same length? Look at mine. See? Not the same. Or maybe Nak was just using a stick to pick it up. You're drunk and your imagination get the best of you. Hey do you remember our marching song? Let's dance. Ready. The drums of war sound off like rolling thunder as we set out to protect our homeland. Our thirst for battle is great even though there are no elephants ride. Dusk fills my emptiness with thoughts of love for my beautiful dearest. Mak Can't we sleep a bit longer? Come on. Help me. I don't know what's going with the townsfolk. Only you guys are willing to help. Hey Shin. Aren't you done freaking out? Ter, get up and help us. Yeah Ter go get the axe and help Puak. Ask Nak where the axe is. What again? I went up to Mak's house. The house looks run-down and abandoned. My mom once told me if you look between the legs you can tell if they're ghosts. Hmmm I am... looking for an axe. Do you know where it is? Shin. I did look between the legs, I didn't see shit. So stop freaking out. Really? Yes. How is that possible? Oh gosh Shit! Damn I'm not even finished yet. Holy shit! Ouch. Shit I saw a #$"&@%" Hey Ter. What happened to your face? I saw a #$"@ What? There's a "#&"$"%@ What the heck is he talking about? Thank you. Oh my... Nak is a "/'\#@! What are you talking about? Nak is a What am I? What is wrong with your face, Ter? Hey did you get stung by bees? My mom told me to use limestone paste to heal it. Nak, can you make some? Let me see. Thank you. Mind your step. Nak is @""$ I saw a &%#@ behind the house. She really is%@#&% Ter, stop being silly. What are you saying? Peepee Poopoo, I cannot understand. Nak is a ghost. Guys, it's raining just get inside. Ter What happened to your face? What paper is that? !!??ee ??ing (Bee sting) Let me see. See what? The paper. What paper? I don't have any. Ter. !!??ee ??ing I want to look at the paper. !!??ee ??ing Let me see it now. Ter Ter I @I\&AA !# @^ #I\#$A @^ Oh he said "it's about to rain. He has clothes drying outside." He will go home now. Puak how did you make sense of that. I don't know. Let's go already and get the damn clothes. Gosh I almost had a fling with a ghost. What are you doing? Packing my stuff and leave. We can't stay here. Are you sure, Ter? Of course. I saw it with my own eyes. The ruby ring is exactly like Nak's. Is the ruby big? Jerk. That's not the point. So how come when you looked between the legs you didn't see anything? I don't know. I looked between her legs and I saw nothing except her hot pot. What? I mean the pot in the kitchen. Oh ok. You idiot! You're supposed to look between your own legs! Oh really? And why didn't you say so. Huh? Do you think Mak can read? Of course. He looked really shock. Look, he went inside. I know everything already. Why didn't you tell me. Did you think I would be disgusted? Who told you? Who told me isn't important. We promise each other there wouldn't be any secrets between us? I didn't know how to tell you. What if you couldn't take it? I couldn't risk it. Why wouldn't I take it? I used to be like that too. If he knows the truth, why does he still look so in love? I know. Shit... I know why. It says Nak is "gross" not a ghost! If she is gross then so what? But if you are really gross that's disgusting. You've never had a under arm zit? I had one last year and it was gross. Sheez we're wasting time. Let's pack up and get out of here. Let's go pack up now. Hey why are you taking so long Ter? Hurry. I can't abandon him. What now? Are we really going to leave Mak with a ghost? Can I not go? NC) You saw Nak with her long arm. So you go tell Mak. How can someone that beautiful be a ghost? Anyone here? Anybody home? Hey Ping Why are you crying? Can anyone help me slaughter my cow? I sympathize with you. You must really love your cow. But when you're really starving you can eat anything. Don't think too much. I once ate my own dog. Not like that. The cow is for a funeral offering. Whose funeral? My mom. Aunty Priek is dead? That day at the market. When she told Mak about Nak. Nak was very angry and killed her. Her body was found floating this morning. Damn it. Shin and Ter! Mak Mak Hey What's up? Mak I have something to tell you. Do you know that your wife is... Beautiful! What? Oh yes I wanted to say that your wife is very good looking Like Miss Universe. I just couldn't wait to tell you. Wow you guys are so sweet. You didn't have to make it into big deal. Oh no. We had to tell you now. Next time there's no need to rush. My wife will still be pretty tomorrow. See you. Pee Mak Why don't you invite your friends to eat here? Hey make yourself at home. No need to be too formal. Go ahead. Everything is delicious. Yeah. I saw your mouth watering. So eat up. We are full already. Really? Yes. There was a buffet at the market. Come on Nak will be sad. She worked so hard in the kitchen. That's ok, next time. Up to you I will eat myself. You guys are missing out. I shouldn't have eaten so much. On second thought we should have a bite. Wow! This dish looks good. I'll try a bit. Here you go. Very nice. So delicious. I told you. You must try this one. Huh? Try this Try it. Puak eat it. Just try it. Eat up Yeah just taste it. Where did you learn to cook, Nak? Le Condon Bleu? Shin, why don't you eat anything? Yeah Shin. This one is yours. That is Nak's signature dish. Go for it Shin. Yeah big bite. How was it? Damn good! My Nak is the best cook. Hey anyone wants to hold Dang? My Dang. My son. Peekaboo! What's up baby? Want to play with uncle Shin? Oh yeah Shin. You love kids. Let's play with uncle Shin. Here we go. My boy. Oh Shin, Dang really likes you. Kiss me uncle Shin. Kiss me uncle Shin. Kiss me uncle Shin. See he keeps smiling now. Come here, come to daddy. What are you doing? Oh I know you guys feel like playing charades? Like we did at war, right? Okay, I like that idea. Nak, please join us. Charades, ok? Hurry up Shin. Just watch me. Throw? Javefin? Athlete? Throw? Throw away? Trout? No? Trout? What? Kitchen Kitchen? Oh... a cook? Beautiful cook? Damn what the hell? Nak's kitchen? Mak's kitchen. No Mak and Nak's kitchen? No? Will he guess right in this life time? Pan? Knife? Spear? Correct! I told you so! What's with the spear? Body? Armpit? Armpit hairs? No! Sweaty armpit? Smelly armpit? No! Bumpy armpits! No that either! Gosh! I wonder what Mak's IQ really is? What is it, a bed? A bed, right? Bamboo bed? Correct! A spear near the bed (danger nearby) That's right! Yayyy... Who the heck came up with this phrase? Your dad must be Shakespeare. That one was difficult. A bird? Fly? Bat? Shirt? Correct! Dog? Tongue? Dog tongue fish? Dog tongue fish wears a shirt? What the hell is it? Ter, what is it? Oh Nak? No Beautiful? Sexy? What? Woman? Wife? Oh I know "Dead" "Dead-Shirt" (Desert) Correct! Yayy...--' So easy, Ter. This is a shirt and she is dead Dead-Shirt, pronounce as "Desert" No, that can't be right. Shin's answer is wrong, right? Yeah Shin is wrong. How can it be wrong? This is a shirt and she is dead! So it's "dead-shirt" (Desert) Yayy...--' Something wrong with your brain! What is going on? So what is the answer? Let me see the paper. What are you doing Ter? I'm still very hungry. Oh I just realized I forgot I was cooking rice at home, I better go check. Yeah I was about to remind him too. So let's go before it burns. Quick quick. How about the shirt? Forget about it. Why don't you tell me the answer first? I already gave the right answer. Right my ass. That was close. Hold on! Shin, hurry up. Shin, come on. Wait up Holy shit Shin, hurry up. Hey wait up Ter hurry. Ter! She's right behind you Omen Ter. Hurry up'.! Ter, untie the boat. Let's go! Paddle hard. Why the heck are we turning?! Shit! We're back here again! Go that way! Why are you turning again? Where are you guys going in such a hurry? Don't you want to finish the game? I didn't get a chance to play yet. So what phrase would you act out? NW OB Puak, what does it mean? It means "Mind your own business!" Did you even have to ask? Just go! Damn it I think Nak is on to us for sure. She won't let us live. What? You go check. You guys get out of my house right now. What's wrong with you Mak? You guys are no different than the townsfolk who think that my wife is a ghost. You have to listen to us. Your wife died already. Everybody knows it. My wife is not dead. Ping lied to all the villagers. They said when I was at war Ping tried to seduce Nak. When I didn't show any interest he bad-mouthed me by telling all kinds of lies. Everyone believed him. Now everybody hates Nak too. I get the picture. But you didn't have to change your voice. So that's it. So Ping fooled all of you too. No, you're the one who is being fooled. Watch your mouth! Stop being an idiot. You have to believe us. We are telling you this because you are our friend. I don't need any friends like you! Mak! Mak! I think... we will really need to do something drastic. I kicked them all out already. What did your friends say? I don't care what they say. They cannot talk about you like that. If you are really a ghost then I should be able to see through you. Let me try. Hey Hey I can see past you. Wow so cool! Super cool. Enough. What did you do to get this dirty? Let's see what my darling prepared for me to eat. Mmmm your cooking is as good as always. Nak my love are too pretty to be a ghost. Right? Wait up! A Ghost! Why don't you try to scare me? C'mon stick your tongue out. Scare me. You are no fun. Boo! Damn fatso, don't make me smack you upside the head. Are you going to wear this mask all night? Why not? It's kinda funny. Okay. I begin to get sad, looking far across the sky It's nearly dawn, the light is faint. I know our time is coming to an end. My heart is breaking but don't know what else to do. I want to cry... and beg time to go by slowly... I need more time. To look at each other. I wish I could freeze this moment... forever before we must part. If Dang wakes up and no one's there, he won't cry? Don't worry Dang doesn't wake up in the middle of the night. Look. 10 cents per ball. If you can knock them all down, you win a doll. Baby, watch this. I'm just warming up. This next one for sure. Almost This is the one. Go Yay! Hit it. Ouch Baby, look fireworks. Wow See Nak I told you. I have good aim. I will get you a doll. Told you. Even as a kid I always had good aim. The line is so long. We'll have to skip this ride. Let's go play something else.. Look the line is gone. You're right. Nak... Do you love me? What kind of question is that? Why? You don't love me anymore? Of course I do. Love me a lot? Lot lot Love me a lot lot lot lot? Hey baby look, there's a haunted house too. We can go after this. Aren't you scared of ghosts? Who, me? Where? Come on out. Ghosts? Nothing to be scared of. Baby If one day I die can you live without me? Why are you asking me this? Just tell me. I want to know. No If anyone is going to die then I want to die first. If I don't have you. I can't go on. But if I die first you'd be able to find a new husband easily with that big butt of yours! Haunted house. Please keep the doll for me. Okay. Let's go, baby. Gosh what kind of a ghost goes in a haunted house. So who will be scaring who? I brought some powerful magic. Like what? Holy rice. I got it from a monk. Very sacred. Good good. By the way, where is Aey? Where is he? Hey Where have you been, Aey? I had diarrhea. You were gone long. Baby, don't be scared. Play with me. Play with me. Boo! I think I screamed too loud. So I scared him away. Sorry Mak. This is for your own good. Play with me. Shin you are the look out. Hurry up Ter. Puak, hold his legs. It's stuck. Shit. She's on to us. What are we going to do? The door is stuck. Gosh. Too late. She is coming. What now? I have no idea. Hey Why are you jumping? That damn boy did. He was so energetic. Play with me. Play with me. Play with me. Play with me. Play with me. Play with me. Play with me. Play with me. Or not. UP to you. You think Nak was fooled? Too many props. What the hell? Hey! You guys aren't customers? Or did you get off work already? Why doesn't anybody tell me? Damn it. Letting me hang upside down that long might give me a stroke and kill me. Ok let's go home. Go. You over there. Time to go home. The one who dressed up like Nak's ghost. Wow so trendy. Are you new here? Let's go home. Ter. Where is the holy rice? The rice, hurry! Come on. What the hell are you screaming for? It's just a fake hand. Screaming like that, freaks me out. Look. Hey untie him. Come on. What is going on? Nak is really a ghost! Not again. It's all in your heads. Just like this hand. Mak come here. What is it now? Shit, you scared me. Holy Shit. A lizard! I thought you saw... Her! There are otters around here? You guys won't let this go. We are telling you the truth. If you don't believe us try looking between the legs. I did and saw nothing. Maybe you didn't do it right. You have to look down between your own legs not between Nak's legs! Of course. Who would be that stupid! My wife is not dead yet. Hey Mak wait up. Mak where are you going? How come he looked and didn't see anything? Mak! Mak! Where are you? Mak! Shit Is this Mak's blood? Shit Help! Mak, is that you? Are you okay? Help me. I'm hurt. Help me please. Mak. Help. Help me. Mak what's wrong? My wound. Where? Gosh it's bleeding out. You've had this wound for so long how come it's not healed yet? Do you have something to pressure it? Shin something isn't right here? Yeah I know. It's way passed the rainy season, right? You idiot. Not about that! About Mak looking down between his legs and not seeing anything. So it means... Nak is still alive. But the body I saw in the backyard has the same ring as Nak's. Shit, come to think of it The ring that I saw is on the ring finger of her left hand. So what? It's a wedding ring. So that means Mak should be wearing one too! Softly Ter, what are you doing? Damn Ter! What the hell are you doing? You're hurting him! Ter. Mak's wound is still raw. Damn Mak, you scared me. I thought you had your ring on. My wedding ring? Well my hand hurts so I wear it around my neck instead. These are the bodies of the soldier who went to war. The cemetery is full now. So we have to return the bodies to their family to bury. You've had this wound for so long how come it's not healed yet? No matter what I must return to see my wife and baby. It's him. Run! Ter, what the hell? What the hell? Wait for me. What is happening? Shit! The body I saw was Mak. So Nak really is been bad-mouthed then. What about when I saw Nak's arm stretch all the way to the ground? Or... Maybe Nak used a long stick to get the lime. Yeah must be that spear then. Damn it. Are you sure that Nak is alive? So we must take her with us. You really want to risk that? C'mon. How could we leave her like that? A woman all alone and so vulnerable. I don't care. No matter what... Nak and I will runaway together. Huh? I mean runaway with us. Man, always thinking with the head in your pants. I can't do this man. Hey But Puak does have a point. You too, Ter? If one day Nak is haunted to death. We are all partially to blame for not lifting a finger to help. The living cannot live with the dead! Hurry Nak Nak Nak It's been a while, how are you? I'm so sick of those villagers. Idiots. How could they believe Ping.l tried to talk to them but they wouldn't listen. Just now I busted more than a few lips on your behalf. Please accept our apology. Now we have no doubts about you being alive. That's okay. Shin. What are you scared of now? Come here. Here... Touch her. Trust me. Come on. You can actually touch her. What ghost has skin that smooth? What about those dried leaves? Damn you. She's health conscious. How do you think she keeps up her nice figure. Everyone eats organic foods now. This is why she looks like a model. But there were worms too. Gosh Organic means no insecticide so there are worms. That's how you tell it's safe to eat. You never studied about Hygiene in school? Where is Pee Mak? Hmmm Well, the war front has made its way here. It's very dangerous. Mak told us to take you with us. That's right. How come Pee Mak didn't come with you? The way here is very difficult So he is gathering rations and waiting at the waterfront. Yeah So let me get Dang for you. Let's get into the boat. Come on Nak. Not too far now. Mak should be around here. Puak the boat is sinking! Holy shit. Too much weight. What should we do? Just toss what we don't need. Come on. Throw it Shin. Hey sit still. What now? The water is getting inside the boat. What else can we toss? Is Dang necessary? Yes, of course. The paddles. Give me the paddles. Huh? Hand me the paddles now. Give them to me. Here Is that better? The boat is not sinking anymore! It's good the boat isn't sinking anymore but how do we paddle now, stupid! Why did you toss them out? They are so far now. Should we swim to the other side? I can't swim. Shit. it's Mak! Pee Mak Where are you going? Mak, leave us alone. You're dead. Just let us go. What are you talking about? Mak died during the war. But he doesn't know yet. Yeah. Just forget about him, Nak. You can find a new boyfriend now. Am I not right? What the hell is wrong with you all? Where are you taking my wife? Pee Mak. Let's go. Hurry. Come on. Pee Mak! Pee Mak Pee Mak Pee Mak Pee Mak Pee Mak Shit! Where is he? I don't know. Help. Help me. Pee Mak! Hey, can ghost drown? Don't let him fool you. Pee Mak Help me. I have a muscle cramp Pee Mak. He has cramps! Help me. Ghost can have cramps? Please help him. He must have taken an acting lesson. Help me. His acting coach must be Ang Lee. He's not dead. Help him! Give me your hand, Mak! Pee Mak Calm down. Are you alright? What the heck! Why did you run away from me? We thought you're a ghost. Why did you scream when we threw the holy rice at you? Gosh cuz they struck inside my wound. If it were you, you would scream too! Shit! We got the same problem again. The boat is sinking. Dang is still necessary, right? Sure, he is. Keep paddling. Come on. Faster. Come on! Paddle. The boat is taking on water. Hurry UP! Wait. Wait for what? The boat is sinking. At first I thought Nak was a ghost and Mak was human. Then it turned out Nak is human and Mak is a ghost. And in the end, Mak isn't a ghost after all, just human. So now who is the ghost and who is human? Ter, what the hell are you grumbling about? Yeah... I was confused since the beginning of your sentence. And the names are so damn similar. Mak Mak, Nak Nak. See.. If Nak is still alive. And Mak is still alive. So whose body is it in the backyard? Aey)' why do you have the ring? Aey is a ghost! Why is it when we realize something there is always flashes of lightning? Damn it, who cares! Ter, kick him overboard. Hey come on. Let's go. The boat is taking on water. Let's go. Let's go. Aey, I am sorry. It wasn't me who kicked you. It was Ter. Shake him off. Come on. Hurry... hurry. Paddle harder. We're not moving. Faster. Damn it! Paddling with our hands to escape is no use. Here you go. Thanks. Give it to me, I will paddle. Give me the paddle, I will do it. Give it your best Ter! Row. Ter, why don't you keep rowing? Ter, why did you stop? Ter, keep rowing. Hey hurry. Aey will catch up to us. What is it now? Ter don't stand up. The boat will flip over. What the hell? Why are you standing, Ter? Mak, move. What? Shin, move. Me too? Yeah you move aside. Which way? Right. Fine. Only Puak? Shin you move left. Left. My left or your left. Just pick one! Which side? Whichever left side. Whose left side? The left hand side that you use to wipe your ass! Which way? My wound hurts. Mak did you move back for what! Move. Move where? Move right. Okay.

Gosh! The drums of war sound off like rolling thunder as we set out to protect our homeland. Why are you singing now? I know. And why am I dancing along? Roused to the point of release I raise my white flag in sweet surrender. I bust a rag out and just polish the sword. Yay! Nak is the ghost! Let's Mak, jump! Mak, come on! Mak! Mak! Me too. Mak! Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Ter, hurry. Give me your hand. Ter! Come on. Mak hurry UP! Mak! Shin, jump now! Shin, now! just jump! Shin Shin, just jump! Shin, jump! I told you I can't swim.

Sorry. What's up with that? That hurts! How come you didn't pass out? In the movies I see they do this and they always pass out. What the hell is wrong with you! Puak Is he dead? I don't know. Just drag him away. Run hurry... Run run... Let's go. What should we do now, father? Remember, no matter what happens. Do not step outside the enchanted thread. People aren't donating very much nowadays. We've been waiting for months to get it fixed. Father! I almost shit my pants. Now I do. Father, what's next? Don't worry. I will handle this. Nak Mak, don't! Listen to me, baby. Don't listen to her. Gosh you're a ghost stop with the sweet talk already! Father, please do what you have to. Ter Please give me the holy water. Don't hurt my wife. Don't. Don't hurt my wife. Let me go! Nak! Do it father. Pee Mak. Please help me. Mak, don't! Nak. Nak Let me go. Damn Ter You spilled it all. It's okay. Shin, please give me the holy rice. Let me go. Nak. Nak. Shin. Nak. Chirping... chirping. Hey look, so tame. Eating from my palm. Why not try eating from my feet then! This isn't the time to go all animal lover on us. That's okay. As long as we stay inside the holy thread. We will be safe. Father! What the heck?! Whose hand is it? Shit! Which way to go?! Is that you, Shin? What's up with this? It's time for me to go. Gosh! The monk already made it over the wall. Turn the other way. I'm getting the creeps. Hurry. Nak Pee Mak Nak Pee Mak Nak Pee Mak Nak Pee Mak Gosh that's enough already! This isn't some name calling game. Let's go that way. Aey! Aey, please let us go. We used to be friends. I didn't do anything to you, you know. Ter! You're the one who kicked him off the boat. I told you not to! I'm not a ghost. I don't believe you. Don't come any closer. Don't push! Nak! What should we do now, Ter? Puak, you are still wet right? Of course. Why? Shin. Mak I will count to 3 and push Puak towards Aey now. One Can we talk about this first? Two Shit. Three. I hate you all. Everyone jump him. Jump for what! See? If you are still human why did you scream when the holy water touched you? I screamed because you guys are on top of me and it hurts! Disgusting! Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up. So why does the holy water not hurt you like Nak? I told you I am not a ghost. How come you got the ring? Well... I needed some money. I saw with my own eyes that the ruby ring is exactly like Nak's. Is the Ruby big? Where is Aey? Where have you been, Aey? I had diarrhea. I'm sorry I needed the money to gamble. I had you all wrong. I am sorry. I thought you were a ghost. But actually You are a casino junkie. And you watching too many movies and always making presumptions. Are you guys forgetting something? What? That Nak is still standing here? Nak Mak, let's go. Run! Let's go. It's stuck. This one is stuck too. Gosh Nak Please just let us go. You are a ghost so stay in your own world. You cannot be with the living. It's unnatural. It's sacrilegious. It won't work out. It's not OK. Can't you understand? Don't mess with me! What happened? Nak disappeared. It's stuck too. What are we going to do? If I make it out of this, I will donate a lot of money to fix this damn roof! Puak it's not the roof. Mak, run! Nak please don't hurt us. I'm really scared. Even in your normal form I'm already scared shitless. Now with your head upside down like Spiderman. Why do you keep getting between Pee Mak and I? What have I ever done to you? Because you are an evil ghost! Why did you kill aunty Priek? I didn't kill her. She was drunk, fell in the water and drown by herself. I don't believe you. Beautiful yet a big fat liar! I told you. I didn't kill her. Let's I just wanted to be with the person I love. Why do you guys have to get in the way? This isn't called love. It's called selfishness. Right. Mak can't go anywhere anymore The townsfolk are all scared of him. I am scared too. Why don't you go where you're supposed to go? Just like Mak's aunty. She didn't come back. Neither did aunty Priek. They've probably been reincarnated and are married already. You died already. How can you be with Mak? If I can't be with Mak in this world Then Pee Mak must go with me. What the hell are you standing there for? Mak Mak Are you that scared of me? I am so sorry... If I ever hurt you I wouldn't be able to live with myself. Don't cry baby. You won't look handsome. I am so sorry for lying to you all this time. I just wanted to be with you as long as I could. Even if it's just for one more day. Do you still remember what we talked about on the ferris wheel? I am sorry you can't get to die before me. Please promise me When I am gone. You will have to carry on. Nak... You don't have to go anywhere. You said you lied to me. You didn't lie to me at all. Even though I am a fool. But I am not so stupid that I wouldn't know that my wife is dead. I will go send off your friends. Nak Nak Nak What did you do to get this dirty? Let's see what my darling prepared for me to eat. Your cooking is as good as always. Nak my love you are too pretty to be a ghost. Right? I realized it since we're playing charades. Even if all the townsfolk avoid me and nobody wanted to be my friend. And even if I have to eat dried leave everyday. I would still want to be with you. Thank you but it is impossible. Why not? We can just pretend that nothing has changed. All this time we did fine together. But I'm dead. The living and the dead can't stay together. It's not natural. If that's so then my love for you is also a freak of nature. When I was at war. Do you have any last words? I should have died that day. No one thought I would make it. But I found my way back to you. Help Help Help Help Help Pee Mak Even you died already but was still able to come back for me. You also used your powers to help me hit those cans. So we could bring a doll back for Dang. How is it wrong that we can love each other this much? Aren't you scared of me? You know I am terrified of ghosts. But I am more terrified of living without you. Just one thing though. Don't ever hang upside down like that again. I almost had a heart attack. Damn I am really moved. I promise you no matter what happens we will be friends forever. Yeah If you die and become ghosts I won't be afraid. But I remember you kicked me off the boat. Come on Love you. Nak... Do you love me? I do. How much? Nak loves Pee Mak a lot lot lot. I love you heaps heaps heaps too. There's more... Nak Nak I need more time to look at each other I wish I could freeze the moment forever before we must part. Baby, I love you. Give me your hand to hold and to keep my heart warm Let me look in your eyes so I will never be lonely Let me have your love to inspire me to make my dreams come true. The roof isn't leaking anymore, father. Let us know if there is anything else we can help. Keep up the good work, baby. Be careful of your hand. What? Horn? Hair? You? She? Does she mean head? Yeah? There is head in the phrase. Watermelon head? Exploding head? Potato head? What kind of head? Air head? Headless? Headless. Pee Mak is correct! Yayyy!! This is the first time I got it right. Shin aren't you happy for me? Haunted house. Scarier than ever. Play with me. Wow. So very realistic. I know. Thank you. Come on. Hurry up. Watch this. You'll never hit the target. You throw like a blind man. This time don't help me ok? Everybody Mak has really gone too far. Yeah! We can't let this kind of unnatural go on in our village. Yeah! We can't allow it! No way! Tonight I will get rid of it. Anyone coming with me? Yeah! I want to go too. Shit. Better hurry before you miss out. Go on. Hurry up.
