We're not home right now, but if you leave a message, we'll get back to you as soon as possible. [beep] Hi, everyone! It's Mom! I just wanted to call and tell you how much I'm thinking of you. Stan, I guess you're at work now. Have you had a chance to go to that group thing yet? I think it's a great idea. God, it's hot here. I'm not sure when I'm going to be able to call again. It might be a few days. I just wanted to tell you that I love you and I miss you. Write me. [beep] Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Let's huddle up. Put it in. Come on, Agnes. All right, now give me an H! - H! - Give me an O! - O! - Give me an M! - M! - Give me an E! - E! - Give me an S! - S! - Give me a T! - T! - Give me an O-R-E! O-R-E! What's that spell? Home Store! - What's that spell? - Home Store! - Who's number 1? - Customers! - Who's number 1? - Customers! - Who's number 1? - Customers! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Go get 'em. [Woman] And Charles knows that I don't-- I don't usually go for that kind of thing. But he's telling me [chuckling] how hot I'm making him, and, uh, I can-- I can even hear him. He's-- I can hear him. [laughter] You know, so we both-- we're-- we're both getting into it, getting really-- muttering and talking, and I'm just about to scream, and-- and-- and-- and then the phone goes dead. [snicker] It's pretty romantic, huh? [giggles] Oh, honey, don't worry. Those won't be his last words. You should consider yourself lucky. Phone sex is nothing compared to what Ron did to me the night before he shipped. I know, but it would never be like that with a woman. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Well, you know, I've never had to make that kind of good-bye. Well, why don't we ask Stanley? His wife did. Uh, well, Stan? Grace and I had a nice time. Well, what did you do? We put the kids to bed, you know. Then we watched Leno. You didn't-- That's really none of anybody's business. I'm sorry. It's-- Uh, I mean, it must have been so hard. No, no, no. It wasn't hard. [snickering] [muttering] I was proud to see her go. Of course you were. Mm-hmm. - Of course you were. - [Women] Yeah. [Woman] Yeah, we're all proud. I just want them to come home. When is Ron supposed to come home? January if his tour doesn't get extended. Well, don't hold your breath. They always extend. Welcome to the Army, honey, and my prescription medicine cabinet. [Man on TV] Two bombs have gone off in the capital today, killing at least four people, and there have also been reports of skirmishes between gunmen-- [TV shuts off] What was that? Nothing. What were you watching? Nothing. Turn it back on. W-What? Not everyone is pleased with the new order of things in Baghdad. Thousands today demonstrated in front-- I'm sorry, Dad. You better be. ... the demonstration organized by anti-occupation Shiites. In a disturbing development is Basra in Iraq's south, the Iranians-- [shouting, gunfire] ...raising new security concerns-- [clears throat] What's this I hear about you falling asleep in school? You know better than that. I'm sorry. We get plenty of sleep here every night. There's no excuse for you to be falling asleep in school. I know. I'm not going to have to talk to you about this again, am l? I didn't hear you. No. Good. I want you to go to Mrs. Shimerhorn tomorrow. I want you to apologize, I want you to ask for extra work to show for your disrespect. - But, Dad-- - No buts. Dad, she's going to have her baby any day. Mm-hmm. And she's really grouchy right now. Then you'd better ask her really nice. Dad, l-- I can't just go up to her... [beeping] ...and ask her for more work when l-- Shh! Thank you. There we go. Good night. [kiss] All right now. [kiss] [Dawn] I love you. [water running] [doorbell rings] [sighs] [zip] [Man] Stanley Phillips? Is your wife Grace Ann Phillips? May we come inside, sir? No. Whatever you're gonna say, just say. Mr. Phillips, I regret to inform you, on behalf of the President of the United States, that Sergeant Grace Ann Phillips was killed at 2100 hours on March 12. I was in the shower. Mr. Phillips, may we come inside, sir? Mr. Phillips, this is Chaplain Johnson. He lives on base, and he'll be available to you and your children at any time. Would you like to pray with me, Mr. Phillips? No. Mr. Phillips, I'm going to need you to sign this, please, sir. It's just a form stating you'll be at this address for the next 45 days. Is there somebody you'd like to call while we wait here with you, sir? No. Don't wait. Don't wait. Are you sure? Captain Douglas Tamlin will be your casualty assistant officer. He'll be stopping by here later today with more details concerning your wife's death. Mr. Phillips, any man who's ever been a soldier shares in your grief. Sergeant Phillips was a brave soldier. She died serving the country she loved. [voice fading] [phone rings] [ring] [beep] [Grace] Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley, Heidi, and Dawn. We're not home right now, but if you leave a message, we'll be back to you as soon as possible. [beep] Hey, Mr. Phillips. It's Rick. At the Home Store? Just wondering if you're coming in to work today. Okay. Thanks. [beep] - Race you! - Oh! What's this? Give me that. Thank you. Hi, girls. What are you doing here? Where'd you get that? Someone left a casserole. You okay? Don't eat that. - Why not? - Just don't. Is something wrong? Don't. Stop. Stop. Stop, please. Okay, girls, let's go in the living room. I want to talk to you. Girls. Yeah, Dad? Hey, who's hungry? Who wants to go get something to eat? - I do. - It's only 4:00. So what? Shotgun! You can't call shotgun until you're outside. Race you. Dad? Go. Go, go, go, both of you. Go, go, go, go, go. [car radio] # Doot doo-doot # # Hey, Dad, yeah # # Hey, Dad, yeah # # Shake your booty, no way # # Shake your booty, okay # # Jump jump # - You go get a table... - Okay. ...and we'll go to the arcade. - All right. - Bye, Dad. ## [dance] ## [dance in distance] ## [growing louder] Okay, girls, we're going right now. - Dad-- - Come on. We just got here. We were just getting into it. I don't care. Just come on. Heidi, move. Where are we going? Where would you like to go? I don't know. How about you, Dawn? Is there any place you'd like to go? Enchanted Gardens. Don't be a moron, Dawn. I'm not. Daddy asked where we wanted to go. That's not what he meant. You don't know. Yes, I do. I don't care. I want to. Stop it. Stop it. - Seriously. - Seriously. Stop! Oh, God. Aah! Stop! What if we did? [groans] What? What if we did right now went to Enchanted Gardens? What if we did? What? Go to Enchanted Gardens right now? [Dawn] Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! [excited babbling] Be quiet, be quiet. [screaming] Eww. Huh? Would you like that? We can't. Is that's something you'd like to do? Why not? - Sit down, Dawn. - No! Girls, why not? Dad-- Dad-- We have school. You can miss a few days of school. Yeah, Heidi. - We can? - Yeah. Of course we can. Right, Dad? - Sure. Why not? - Yes! What about your job? Don't worry about my job. Don't worry about his job. Dad-- Huh? Well? What about homework? Don't worry about your homework. Don't worry about our homework. We can do-- We can help you with your homework. Dawn and I can help you in the car. Let's do it. Right now. - Are you serious? - Yeah! Of course he's serious. Yeah. Why not? Let's go. You got to get some fun out of life, Heidi. - Aah! - You, too, Dawn. - Let's do it! - Let's go! Let's do it! Do you guys want to do it? I do! You party pooper! Yes or no, Heidi, right now. This is a one-time-only offer. Enchanted Gardens right now. - Right now, Heidi. - Right now! Do we have an atlas? Let's do it! Ahh! [laughing] [ringing] [beep] Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley, Heidi, and Dawn. We're not home right now, but if you leave a message, we'll get back to you as soon as possible. [beep] Hey. Just wanted to let you know the girls and I are...okay. We just decided to take a little trip. We're having a really good time. [beep] [closes phone] [Man on radio] ...could face fines up to $300 under the new law. There's a flood watch in parts of Western Minnesota through tomorrow evening. Tonight should be cloudy with rain showers likely. Isolated thunders-- Good morning. Good morning. Where are we? I'm not entirely sure. We should call school and tell them we're going to be absent. Let's think of something fun to do today. Can you do that? What's that? What's that? What is that? Supposed to be an answer to my question? Huh? Huh? No? No. Well, let's try that again. Come on. Can we think of something fun that we want to do today? No. No? Why not? We've talked about it too much now. So? So now there's too much pressure. Too much pressure? What are you doing? You cannot just drive into this field. Oh, yes, I can. Dad, what are you doing? I'm doing doughnuts. What's it look like? We're going to get in trouble. - No, no, we're not. - Watch for the birds. No, the birds fly out of the way. What the heck are we doing? Hey! Good morning, Dawn! Are we on a road? Nope. Cool! Fun, isn't it? Yeah! I used to do this all the time when I was a teenager. - Why? - [Dawn squealing] Why? I don't know. It's fun, isn't it? Why would you do this? I don't know. I guess I just like peeling out. [Dawn squeals] I didn't put a ton of thought into everything I did when I was a kid, Heidi. All right. Let's go. [Dawn] Where are we going? [Stanley] Ahh! Whew! - [Dawn] Dad? - Yeah. Are we really going to Enchanted Gardens? Of course we are. Why? I just wanted to make sure. Okay. - Dad? - Yeah. Can we get a monkey? No. What if it's really little? Like littler than a puppy. Still no. Can we get a pony? No. An iPod? No. - Dad? - Yes, Dawn. Can we get our ears pierced? No. Not till you're 13. You know the rules. Dad? [Heidi] Be quiet, Dawn. What? Do I hear something? - Dawn! - I don't hear anything-- Dawn! ...at all, no, no. Be quiet! Girls, come on. Straighten up. I got a surprise for you. What is it? We're going to stop and see Grandma. I can get in around back. Just wait here. [1930s cartoon music on TV] [snoring] My lamp. [sultan laughs] So you want to marry my daughter. [Aladdin] I sure do. Boy! Hey. Hey, Uncle John. What are you guys doing here? Oh, hey, don't-- don't get too close. I think I have bad breath. [villain in cartoon] New lamps for all! Is your dad here? Can I help you? John, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Trying to find a way in. What, the front door too obvious for you? Open the door, man. Hey, bro. How are you, man? I'm good, man. How you doing? Come on in. So what have you been up to, John? I'm studying to take the GRE. Good. You going back to school? I'm thinking about it, yeah. That's great. What for? Law. Or medicine. I haven't decided yet. Oh. That's great. What's new with you? Not much. You all right? What do you mean, am l-- l-- I'm fine. You're not upset? About what? Uh, I don't know. I mean, where do I start? The situation's such a mess. The situation? What situation? What situation? I mean, it sounds like a fucking mess over there. Watch your language. Sorry. Sorry. You don't know what you're talking about anyway. Who does? The administration? I mean, they'll tell you the sun comes out at midnight if it serves their cause. And how about that monkey boy president of yours? He's your president, too. I didn't vote for him. You didn't vote at all, did you? That's-- That's not the point. Isn't it? Just... stop talking. Let's not have that conversation right now. You'd like that, wouldn't you? That's what your side's all about, isn't it? Censoring dissent? Stop. Why? I mean, we're just talking. Are you afraid of talking? No, I'm not afraid of that at all. I just don't want to confuse the girls. Is that all right? I'm sure they're already confused. I mean... really, what do you think about all this? Do you have an opinion? They think their mom's a hero, and they think it's easy to criticize the situation when you're sitting in your mom's living room thinking about going back to school-- maybe law, maybe med-- I don't know. They think every one of those privileged opinions is a freedom that their mother fights for daily on your behalf. That's what they think. Well, it's-- it's good to see that you let them think for themselves. You girls hungry? You think your dad will buy us lunch? It's 4:30, man. You think your dad will buy us dinner? Want to buy Uncle John dinner? You don't want to come? No, I think I'm just going to stay here and... take a little cat nap. You're bigger than the last time I saw you. How old are you now? Dawn's 8. I'm 12 1/2. Wow. How old are you? Bet that sounds pretty old to you, doesn't it? Do you have a job? Why? Are you hiring? No. Hey, how come you kids are out of school? Dad's taking us to Enchanted Gardens. - Why? - For fun. You think that place is fun? What do you mean? Nothing. Uncle John? Yeah. Why did Dad quit the Army? He didn't quit. What do you mean? He had to leave because of his eyes. The Army's strict about crap like that. But weren't his eyes always bad? Mm, more or less. Well, if they're so strict, how'd he get in in the first place? He didn't tell you? Oh, Christ. Ahem. Well, if he didn't tell you, he probably wouldn't want me to, so-- All right, you promise not to tell your dad if I tell you? He cheated. How? He had a buddy take a picture of the physical examiner's eye chart. Memorized the letters. What? Your dad wanted to serve so bad. I mean, he really bought all that patriotic "l Want You" crap. Which was a good thing, too, because he never would have met your mother otherwise. [Heidi] Well, how'd the Army find out about his eyes? Eventually they just gave him a test he couldn't cheat on, and that was that. End of the dream. [sobbing] Why don't you and Dad like each other? Did your dad tell you that? Well, we're just-- we're just different. We have different opinions. Doesn't mean we don't like each other. I mean, do you agree with him about everything? You shouldn't. Why not? Because it's important that people have their own views based on an understanding of facts. Ahem. But it's also important not to trust the facts because most of them are lies. I don't understand. Well, it basically comes down to a... gut thing. You just have to be open to allowing for a truth which differs from your own opinions, or else you'll never actually see the truth at all. [beeping] [whispering] What's that about? It's her time of day. What, it's-- it's her time of day? Mom and Dawn both set their watches at the same time every day. That way, they know that they're both thinking of each other at the same moment. Girls? Yeah? Yeah? Do you... want to play tag? Sure. That's good because... you know why? Why? Because, uh, you're it. You're it. Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo! You're it. Time out. What do you mean time out? You can't call time out. That is so lame. You can't just-- All right. I'm just going to read the paper and find out what's going-- [Heidi, Dawn] Time in. You know, I mean, it's so typical. I'm the victim of this kind of thing every single day, and you know why? It's because I'm an honest guy, and I have to pay for it. Mm-hmm. - Ha! - Aah! [phone rings] [knocking] Hey, the phone's ringing. Open up. [ring] [ring] Hello. Yeah, this is John. Oh, hey, Mary. What the hell are you doing, man? What's wrong? Where are the girls? The girls are fine. Stan, I just talked to Mary. I know what's going on. Do the girls know? No. That's good. Don't tell them yet. We got to go. We got to go. We got to go. Stan, what are you doing to them? I'm taking them on a trip. Just stay out of it. Stay out of it? You're the one who brought me into it. I didn't bring you into anything. You were just here. I didn't plan that. Do you really think that-- that-- that taking them to an amusement park is going to help them get over losing their mother? - Just stay out of it. - You're going to screw those girls up. Is that what you want to do? - Get out of my way. - They'll never forgive you. Get out of my way! Nobody asked you! Do you understand? I got to go. Don't you want to wait for Mom? No. We're on a schedule. Stan... please stay and wait for Mom because we can talk it all out together. No. It was nice seeing you again, John. I got to go. Okay? Girls! Girls, get your stuff together! Girls! - Come on. Get up. - Aah! Okay. Come on. Get up. We got to go. - Why? - What? - We got to go right now. - Why? I thought we were going to see Grandma. We're going to talk to her later. - Get in the goddamn car. - Dad. What about Uncle John? What about Uncle John? We didn't get to say good-bye. You'll see him again. [Dawn] I'm bored. Let's drive into a field. No, Dawn. We already did that. Why not? Because we already did it. So? So we ought to do something else. Seems like we've been driving forever. Well, it's going to be forever with that attitude, isn't it? You're kind of quiet back there, Heidi. What are you doing? Just working on my report. What's your report about? Mom. Whose idea was that? Mrs. Shimerhorn's. Mrs. Shimerhorn's. Why does she think that's a good idea? Because she thought it would help or something. Help with what? What do you need help with? I don't know. You know how people get when Mom goes away. No. How do they get? Like serious. [Dawn] I call bed! I call bed. Not if I get there first! Oh! Dad, this is so fun. You want to try? I'm going to go get a cot. Okely-dokely, artichokey. I have to poop. You don't have to tell me things like that. There's free shampoo and a sewing kit! Hey, what are bath salts? [Woman] Noble Elementary. Mrs. Fissel? Yes. Hi. This is Heidi Phillips. I was calling to tell you that my sister and l are going to be missing a couple of school days this week. Oh, that's okay, Heidi. We're not sick or anything. We're just taking a trip. For fun? Oh, Heidi, I understand. I was wondering if you could have our teachers e-mail our dad our homework. Of course, sweetheart. Is Mrs. Shimerhorn there? Mrs. Shimerhorn is in the hospital. Why? She's actually having her baby. Oh, she is? Yeah, and Miss Abrams will be taking over for her for the rest of the year. Oh. Can you ask her if it's all right if my report is late? Mrs. Shimerhorn said it had to be done by Monday. I'm sure it's fine, Heidi, okay? I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye, sweetheart. Bye. [Dawn] Who was that? Mrs. Fissel. What did you call her for? I was trying to get our homework. Heidi! She was really nice. [toilet flushes] That's cool. Bang-bang! Choo-choo train! Come on, Heidi, do your thing! Say woo! What? [sprays water out of her mouth] Got you. Marco. [Dawn] Polo! [Heidi] Marco. Polo. - Marco. - Polo. - Marco. - Polo. Count how long I can do it. Okay. Yeah. Dad, watch this. That's good. This is a long time. It's like five days. [gasp] Aah! That was good. - Yaah! - [giggling] - [Stanley] That was about, like, - How long? I don't know, two minutes? [Dawn] Ha! [Heidi] You weren't counting. [Stanley] I was close. Dad? Yeah. What's going on? What do you mean? Why are we doing all this? I just wanted to give you girls a surprise, you know? Take you on a trip. You didn't go to work yesterday, did you? No, I didn't go to work. Were you fired? You know Mom's going to be really mad if you lose your job, right? I didn't lose my job, Heidi. Okay? But if you were going to, you'd tell us, right? Yeah, I would tell you. I'm going to go to sleep. What are you doing? Nothing. You're not old enough to smoke. I'm 18. No, you're not. Want to bet? I saw you with your mom at the pool. That wasn't my mom. Oh, yeah? Who was it? It was an autistic woman. I take care of her for money. You shouldn't lie. I'm not lying. It's the truth. How old are you? Want one? Sure. Heidi? Heidi? Heidi! [cough] Why are you coughing? You haven't even smoked it yet. I knew you'd never smoked before. [Stanley] Better go home, boy. Get your stuff. We're going right now. - Now? - Yeah. Right now. It's in the middle of the night. You arguing with me? Move. Jesus, Heidi, you can't just walk around in the middle of the night by yourself. You could have been hurt, kidnapped, who knows? I said I was sorry. All right, but what I want to know is what the hell you were doing out there in the first place. Make me leave your sister alone in...some hotel. I couldn't sleep. You couldn't sleep? Why not? Why do you think? Is that why you're falling asleep in class? Oh, boy. What do you do every night? I don't know. Walk around. I went to a support group the other day. What? You know, the one they got at Debbie Sager's house. For military wives. I stopped by there the other day. Isn't that weird? What did you talk about? Uh-uh. No. I didn't. Did it help? I don't know. I don't think it did. Will you do me a favor if you can't sleep? Um, will you wake me up? Why? So I can talk to you. Really? Yeah. You'd do that? Yes, I would do that. Yes. [Stanley] You still want to try it? With you? Yeah. I'd rather you do it with me than some punk kid. Well? What's it going to be? Sure. Have you ever done this before? No comment. Do you want one, or should we split one? Let's split one. Good idea. [cough] Good one. [coughing] Oh, are you okay? Yeah. [coughing] Are you sure? [coughing] Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. [coughing] Maybe we should stop, right? I'm going to go get some water. You stay here, okay? [coughing] [coughing] ## [guitar] # The world could fall apart # # But you're my heart, my dear # # I will sing this song # # Till we are gone, my dear # # How do I keep you from losing your way? # # Hope you'll go out # # And you'll come back some day # # But love is not enough # # This I know # Stay together.

You said we could get anything we wanted. You know the rules. Not until you're 13. I'm almost 13. And I'm 8. This is something you really want to do right now? Yes. All right. Let's do it. Okay! Really? Yeah. Is it going to hurt? You won't even feel a thing, I promise. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. Did it hurt? No. - Excuse me. - Sorry. That's okay. Is that it? That's it. Want to see? Looks good, Bear. You're all grown up. - You next? - Yeah. Is that all right? [Stanley] Ooh. I just got my ears pierced. That's nice, sweetie. That looks good. This one's nice, too. Did it hurt? A little. A little bit? You did it. Where's Dawn? Find her. How much do I owe you? Oh. 32.50. - [Heidi] Dawn? - Thank you so much. Dawn! Dawn? Dawn? Dawn! Bear, where are you? Dawn! Bear! Dawn Amber Phillips! See if she's over there. Bear. Dawn, honey, what are you doing in there? Dawn, are you all right? Dawn. Anybody home? [Dawn] Come in. Hey. Hey. [Stanley] This is a nice place. This really is. You decorate it yourself? No. Well, it's really, really nice. It's a nice little house. Nice walls, nice-- nice roof. Phone. I could see a nice little happy family living here. Yeah. You miss home. Yeah. I miss Mom, too. You know, I was thinking. Maybe this would be a good thing to get for the house. You could put it up in you and your sister's room. Would you like that? Mm-hmm. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, Bear. Come here. [Heidi] Dad? Yeah. You smell. I think I like this one. Try it. Looks pretty nice. [Dawn] Hey, Dad. Yeah. What do you do at work all day?

You're right about that. #...hold you in my arms # # It scares me # # Just to think that something so beautiful # # Could just come apart in my hands # # I've always been chasin' rainbows # How are you feeling, excited? You getting excited? Yeah. Good. How are you feeling? I'm good. Dad? Hmm? Do you ever think that Mom should have stayed home? All the time. Why did she have to go? She was doing her duty, Heidi, you know that. I know, but what exactly does that mean? We've talked about this. We have people all over the world Iooking out for our safety. When they discover a threat, they have to act on it. That's the way the world is. On the news they're saying that we went to war with the wrong people, that it was all a lie. Well, you can't always believe everything you hear on television, can you? Sometimes you just got to trust that you're doing the right thing. We got to believe-- Well, what if you can't? Then we're all lost. [ring] [ring] [Grace] Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley, Heidi, and Dawn. We're not home right now, but if you leave a message, we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Hey. It's Stanley and the girls. I just wanted to hear your voice on the machine and tell you that we're all right. We're in Florida. I told you we were going to Florida, right? Taking the girls on a little trip. Anyway, do you remember that, uh-- I was thinking that when we-- when we came down here before you shipped out, and I just-- I wanted to apologize because, uh-- because I was so angry back then, and, uh, I just wanted to let you know I was thinking that-- that the reason I was so angry was because I was ashamed... that it was you who was going and not me. We would have been better off if it was me. The girls would have been better off. And I made such a fucking mess out of this thing. Grace, I'm such a mess. I-- I don't... know how to talk to these girls. I haven't even told them. So you got to tell me what to do...Grace. Please, God, tell me what to do. So how do I say it? [whispering] You got to tell me what to do. Who were you talking to? School. Mrs. Shimerhorn. Mrs. Shimerhorn? She said everything's going to be fine but we got to get that report in and do a couple of makeup assignments, but, uh, to enjoy the trip. So let's go. Come on. Load up! - [Dawn] Are we there yet? - No. - Are we there yet? - Mm-mmm. - Are we there yet? - No. - Are we there yet? - Mm. - Are we there yet? - No. - Are we there yet? - No. Are we there yet? No. - Are we there yet? - No. Are we there yet? No! Are we there yet? How about now? [gasp] Oh, it's right there! It's right there! Oh, my gosh, Dad! Step on it, old man! There it is, Heidi! It's right there! What ride do you want to go on first? Mission accomplished. I wonder if they have a TV there. They probably do. It's all yours. Take your pick. Welcome to the Enchanted Hotel. Enchanted Gardens! Enchanted Gardens! Enchanted Gardens! [squealing] All right, girls. Uh, just don't stay up all night, okay? - Okay, Dad. - Because we got to get-- We got to get some sleep because we've got a big day tomorrow, okay? Okay. Big day. [whispering] Let's stay up all night. Okay. [TV sound louder] "We can, we must, "and we will see it through to completion "the mission for which these young Americans "and their families have sacrificed, "carrying with us the memory "of those who have lost their lives "in the battle. "We ask our commanders on the ground "at every opportunity "if there's something we ought to be doing differently. "In our 200-plus years, "America has learned some important lessons, "and one is that weakness is provocative. "It tempts aggression. That appeasement is--" [ring] Hey. It's Stanley and the girls. I just wanted to hear your voice on the machine and tell you that we're all right. We're in Florida. I told you we were going to Florida, right? Taking the girls on a little trip. Anyway, do you remember that, uh-- I was thinking that when we-- when we came down here before you shipped out, and I just thought I wanted to apologize because, uh-- because I was so angry back then, and, uh, I just wanted to let you know I was thinking that-- that the reason I was so angry was because I was ashamed... - Hey. - Hey. You look like you're ready to go. I am. Oh, that dress looks pretty. Thanks. Where's your sister? Outside. Outside doing what? I don't know. Some Heidi thing. Oh, right. Ooh. Okay. ## [humming] ## [humming] What are you doing out here all by yourself? You all right, sweetheart? Yeah. How are you? Me? I'm just fine. Just fine. Slept like a rock, which is good. You know your sister's just about ready to burst, she's so excited. What do you think? You want to get going? Sure. Sure. Dad? Yeah. Nothing. Have an enchanted day. This way... or this way? [all laughing] Aah! Aah! Aah! Do you want this balloon? Yeah. I like blue. I don't know. This is kind of-- This is a powerful balloon. I don't know if l should let you hold it. Whoa! Ha ha ha! That's a big balloon. Heidi, Heidi, hold your sister. Hold your sister down. Hold her. Hold her. The wind's going to take her away. [no audible dialogue] What do you want to do now? Let's go. Yeah. You want to leave? I did everything I wanted to do. Okay. Come on. Why aren't we on the highway? Let's get out of the car. Sit down. I need to tell you something... and it's something I should have told you a lot earlier. You know your mother and l love you very, very, very much. Dawn. Yeah. Nothing's ever going to change that. Ever. Do you remember when we talked about things that could happen while she was away? Well, your mother was hurt. She was hurt real bad. [Dawn] Where is she? She was hurt so bad, they couldn't fix her. [Heidi] She's just hurt, right? Dad. She's just hurt. Where is she? It's okay, Dawn. We'll take care of her. She's just hurt. Your mom is a soldier, and soldiers sometimes get hurt, and sometimes they even... die in battle. And that's what happened. [no audible dialogue] [Heidi] Grace Ann Phillips was born in Newport, Indiana, on October 3, 1971. She was a happy child who loved spending time outdoors. Once she even spent an entire summer sleeping in a refrigerator box in her mother's backyard. She waterproofed it with garbage bags so she could sleep in it even when it rained. Grace was a brave woman. She enlisted in the Army right out of high school. She met my father, Stanley Phillips, at boot camp in Fort Knox, Kentucky, Iater that summer. They married after training was over. My father says that, to this day, he's still surprised Mom said yes, which is funny because Mom used to tell my sister and me she was worried he was never going to ask the big question. Grace and Stanley loved each other very much. They were best friends. Anyone who knew Grace knows she was a special person. She was kind, generous, and funny. She had a loud, silly laugh you could hear even when you were in the next room. And she could sing better than anyone. We'll miss her very much, but we promise to always think of you when we laugh, wake up, fall asleep, and look at the ocean. I promise to keep your memory with us forever. [stammering] Is it time? Not yet. Okay, get ready.
