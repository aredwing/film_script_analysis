One night you're sound asleep, when... Yeah. That was a creak. That was definitely a creak. Most people in this world attribute the strange phenomenon to ghosts. That's just ridiculous. Ghosts don't exist, stupid. Well then, what is it? It's a demon. Demon! Demon! Demon! Demon! Demon! Demon! Damon. Demons are everywhere. They're deceivers. They only pretend to be ghosts so that you'll believe in them. You want to know the truth about your little friendly ghost? Demon! There are all kinds of demons. Each one sent with a specific evil task to inflict upon your unsuspecting soul. Do you ever get a tingling sensation in the center of your back? And you just can't scratch it? Itchy demon! You ever see a sort of ugly looking kid walking down the street with a smoking hot babe? Gold digger demon! Does your dog ever bark at thin air for absolutely no reason? Mailman demon! But be not afraid, for there are brave souls whose job it is to banish these beasts back to hell! Together, we are: Blair, Brock, Doug, Pepper, And I'm your man, Damon Dealer. - Together we... - COMMUTE. To haunted houses and sites to... CONFIRM. ...the presence of the super natural. Then we COMMUNICATE with said supernatural entities so that we can CLEAN HOUSE. Leave the natural activity in the bathroom, son. That's right. Because we only investigate SUPERNATURAL ACTMTY. And cut! Do you like that? I... I... - Did you like that? - Yeah. It was genius, right? Evil. So, that's your big hook. That's why we're the number one paranormal show on TV. I like it. Of course... This guy has a little bit to do with our ratings as well. My name is Brett. I'm the editor. I mess with the footage and make it look like there's ghosts. Or demons, or something. I don't know. It pays. Orbs are easy. Easy? Orbs are a joke, bro. They're a joke. It's child's play. So, does the rest of the paranormal team know that the show is bogus? Not everybody. Why not? Let's put it this way: What my team doesn't know, can't hurt them. Oh my god! What was that? It sounded like a gunshot. Jesus. No no. Wait. Wait. God. Stop. Stop stop stop. Don't go. What are you doing? Check it, brother. Got us a brand new Beechwood 700 model. You bought a shotgun? XCBR-14. Black bone. Collector's Edition. Hot damn! When I sent you out to get paranormal equipment, this is not what I had in mind. Come on now Double D. Check this: Shoot Right Pro trigger system. And Trinity corrosion control. You understand I have no idea what you said right now. It means... Evil don't stand a chance, boy. Squirrel demon! My name is Doug Thomas. Film maker. Four years ago, Damon Dealer captured my attention with an eight second pitch, a documentary titled Freaky Fraud Day, in which he was to expose his tv show Supernatural Activity as a hoax. What you have just seen and are about to see is that documentary. Join me. ...on a safari through the brilliant mind of me. Correction: The brilliant mind of Derek Lee Nixon. About four years ago, Doug came to me with an idea: Shoot a movie about a documentary about Damon Dealer. Let me break it down for you. I'm the dude that's filming another dude, that's filming a documentary about a tv show, that ain't even real. We four deep, sister. So... This is the neighborhood that I grew up in. These are some nice houses. And right over here... This is where Tara Moore got hit by a car. Second grade. We're getting off the bus. Came around the front, this big ass truck. Wham! Oh my god. I was walking two feet in front of her. Is she okay? Her head exploded like a water balloon. OH NO! Jesus. I had to pick up her brains. Used to always play duck duck goose. In class. Yeah. You know what? We're going to talk about something else now. She used to always pick me. Yep. Nope. What do you think about the show, Damon? What do you think makes it so successful? Mom killed herself a year later. Damon! What? What about the show makes it so successful? Oh. I don't think it's a secret. I mean come on. I'm five foot seven inches tall. Do you know how many fans I have in China, bro? Please. What about the show makes it so successful? You're asking me what makes this show so successful? Come on, guy. You act like you don't already know. I think it's pretty obvious that I'm the main attraction. I don't know why the show is so successful. I don't watch TV. Why not? You know what this is right here hot shot? - A bible? - That's right. A bible. You don't read about some DVR in 2nd Corinthians, do you? David. Adonis. Brockhaas. When I go to the gym, the weights catch up on me. That's right because there ain't any sitcoms in Revelations. I got all the reality TV I need right here. Jesus Christ, my lord and savior. He right there is the ultimate survivor. Believe that. I had an eight pack when I was eight. Shoot. So you think you can dance? More like, so you think you can sin. You can't be gyrating all over the place. Fornicating. Basically all it is, is fornicating. This face could make the Sahara wet. I don't even watch sports. But if I did, I'd create a new event in the Olympics. It's called praying. Everybody wins. Everybody gets on their knees. They all get a medal. Either gold, frankincense, or murr. But everybody's a winner. I love you, America. Next question. Come on. This is fun. This is good. - I like this. - Alright. So what got you into the whole paranormal thing? Well... My mom's a psychic. So I guess I got my swindling genes from her. Oh. I'm an accountant. And my dad, you know. He... He passed away when I was three. So... Well... He don't care none about the paranormal. It's magic. I mean, this little prick started from day one. When he was nine or ten, we bought him one of those kits. And he just went berserk. The wife thought, "hey. it'd just be a phase. right?" First year of middle school, he starts levitating and shit. Then we knew... He had a big problem. Oh my god. He levitating. He levitating! Girl, he floating. He floating. Tuck. Tuck. Come on, man. I'm going to show you where the real magic happens. Babe! Hey babe. Oh yeah. Our relationship is somewhat of a really big secret. Why keep it a secret? Because the producers want to keep our pervert fan base happy. And the thing with pervert fan bases, is they like knowing you're single. Even though they're never going to meet you. They like thinking that if they did, that they could hook up with you if they wanted. So where did you guys meet? Strip club. Yeah. She was making about... About a hundred grand a year. Putting herself through college. You know, so she could get a job that would start her out at about forty grand a year. I was a lot different back then. Do you even really like her? - What who? Blair? - Yeah. Why would you ask something like that? I mean, look, you know. She's a stripper. Once a stripper, always a stripper. Right? Between you and me, man. Why don't you just level with me. Why don't you just shut up right now, man? Don't judge her, alright? You don't know shit about her. Hey. Look around you. The world's a zoo. When you find the right one, you've got to mount that. Let me tell you something. You see this? That's how much I like her. Right there. Wow! You're going to propose. Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to do it yet. But I think it's going to be very public. So I'm sure she'll have to say yes. Supernatural Activity Headquarters It goes by many names. I just call it "the office". Because, well, it's an office. Hey Jim. - Ryan. - Dwight. Temp. Okay. For the finale. Now it's just a season finale. My team doesn't know it's really going to be the finale-finale. I've got the perfect place locked down. Three words: In. Burial. Ground. I forgot about that. Sorry. Oh. Thanks, Jim. Okay. I stand corrected. Native American burial ground. So... Damon, I've got it! Got what? Our season finale. Listen to this. It's from Hicksville, Texas. "Mr. Dealer, sir." "You're not going to believe this." "But me and my girl got a ghost up in my crib" "that's driving me bananas." "I'm not sure if you're familiar with the local legend around here" "but there's a magical hairy creature that lives in the woods" "called the Smallsquatch." The Smallsquatch, Damon! Wow. That's crazy. I mean, this could be the final piece for my Smallsquatch project! Yeah. Yeah. Totally. I mean, I mean. We've got to keep the show in mind with the general audience. I mean, Bigfoot. It's kind of overplayed. Don't you think? The Wild Man of the Navidad Graves. The Boogie Nights thing. You know, that's three. Okay. Those were all Bigfoots. This is a Smallsquatch. - They're different. - Yeah. Yeah. I just... you know what? I got it. It's perfect. Next season, we open up, first thing. Smallsquatch. Hell. We'll do it all season long. Okay, Damon. No. Okay? It makes way more sense to do this as a season finale. We don't have anything picked out. Well yeah. About that... We kind of already do. Okay, so? Cancel it. Damon, we're going to Hicksville. We can't go to Hicksville. So what did Blair say to change your mind? Dude. She didn't say anything to change my mind. My mind is not changed. Alright, look. I'm going to discredit the Smallsquatch people. And we're going to do the season finale on the Indian burial... ...the Native American burial ground. Okay. Why does it matter which one we do? What does it matter? Are you kidding me? Dude, do you know how many years she spend working on the Smallsquatch project? If I expose it as a fake, dude, in front of millions of people... Forget about the wedding. So, how do you plan on discrediting the Hickville people? Listen. If you confirm and support crackpots, that makes you a crackpot. Supernatural Activity, we're legit. We don't deal with crackpots. So... You know, the next step is to see if there's a commutable leaf in the mythology. Without that, all you got is crackpots. You know what? Whoa whoa. What are you doing? Where are we going? I'm going to go see if anyone's even heard of this Smallsquatch. Well, I ran into him one time. When I was plowing through some trim on my tractor. From what I heard, she was walking in the woods, and it just attacked her. Bigfoot? He banged a witch. Nine months later, out came this little, hairy wizard. Oh vato. Polka what? Poco Pata's like some Lord of the Rings type shit, ese. For real, man. That big guy should have stuck the squash on Frodo Baggins. Vato could've took that ring back with just a look. Just a pinche look, ese. You know what I'm saying? Have you heard of the Smallsquatch? - Yes I have. - You have? What does it look like? It's big and real... Really hairy. Very confused. Lies like you wouldn't believe. Wild imagination. From what I heard according to legend is, if he catches you he'll tickle you to death. - Tickled to death. - Death by tickle. He tickles you to death. You just like piss your pants and die. Well the other day I was at my house smoking. And my cousin started cracking up. I went inside to see what was going on. He was dead. So I figured it had to be the Smallsquatch. Since they say death by tickle. That little hairy midget, bro, tickled Gandolf the Gray till he pissed his clothes. You know what I'm saying, ese? He tickles you, and tickles you, and tickles you. And then, you stop breathing. And then... then... then... You die. - Forget about it. - Okay. Okay. Sorry. Thank you for your time. Bernie Madoff with my money. I think it's safe to say the mythology is present. Dude, there are more important things to take into consideration when dealing with a hoax. Like, we haven't even met the subjects yet. Hey. There's a kid walking around. I thought she said it was a couple. I don't know. Ask the kid. Excuse me, kid. Hey. Is this 1131 Oakwood Drive? No, sir. You just missed it. It's back one more house. What the fuck did you just say to me, boy? Uh... what? Kid, you talk to me like that one more time, I swear to God I'm going to get out of this car. I'm going to beat the living shit out of you. I'm sorry sir. Is that a camera? Oh my god. Can you believe this kid? Is that a camera? Is that a camera? You're a fucking retard. He's a retard. I'm going to get out of this car. I'm going to beat the living shit out of him. Yeah, it's a camera. You're going to be on TV, guy. Congratulations. You just spent your 15 minutes looking like a fucking retard. - Well... - ISAAC! What's going on here? I've got to go. It was sure nice to meet you folks. Come back and visit any time. Man, get the fuck out of here. I was nothing, papa. Just city folk. They've got cameras! And cut your hair, Beaver! It's uncanny. See these locals? They're hostile. Every small town. Now the subjects are most crucial in deciding whether or not a site is eligible for a hoax. I've always said that. You know, I mean. You want them to be competent, right? - But not necessarily too smart. - True. You know. A little bit out there. Right? - But not crazy. - Also true. You know, like, attractive is good. Right? For ratings. But you don't want them to be so hot that it's distracting. Not even remotely true. Okay. I'm not asking for your validation, bud. False. You'd be lost without me and I should be the one running the show. Go put a shirt on. Oh my god. Oh my god! - Dewey? - Yes. Damnit Dealer. You're on my front porch right now. I am speechless. God damn freaking Dealer! Sorry. I had to get that out. Your team is fantastic. Blair, you are... You are gorgeous. I don't even know how many times I've... never mind. Brock, you're just freaking... Abs are stacked. How many of those? 12? Jesus. Pepper. I love you. Oh my god. Spit. Just spit all over the place. On me. I'll rub it around. And Doug... That camera work, man. Like, intense. The heart beats the whole time. It's just. And damn it, Dealer. Can you give me one of these? Just one. I guess he watches the show. - Oh my god. - HEY! Whoa. I'm sorry. - HEY! - Sorry. I'm sorry. Hey. We can go inside. Do you want to go inside? Please. I'm freaking out, man. This... This is my crib. It's probably nothing compared to yours, but. You know, it'll do. Take a seat wherever. You're good. Yeah. Table works. This is Mitzi, the love of my life. She's my everything. That's a great set. Thank you. So, Dewey, What do you do for a living? Just a little about you. I'm still... I'm sorry. Damon Dealer is in my house. Do you work out, bro? I've been looking for a P90X partner like, forever. Answer the question, Dewey. You're my everything, babe. I'm a tool. - Do what? - A tool. - Do what? - Tool. - Say again? - I'm a tool. - Say what? - Technical Operator On Location ...for the phone company. Oh okay. Yeah yeah. TOOL. Perfect. Yeah. It's one of those synonyms. I've got you. Yeah. Correct. So do you think this is like... ...the Smallsquatch? I mean, I guess he is. Well, I don't want to say for sure. It's a little hard to tell. I mean... The modus operandi fits. You know, so many other demons as well. So... What? Like who, per se? Like Bro-thelzar. For one. Who's Bro...? Bro-thelzar. He was a brontosaurus demon from the Jurassic Park... period. He was around about 138 million years ago. He's a seer demon. And he was the first one up on the 2012 thing. This is WAY before the Mayans. Just to give you an idea... ...how big his bronto-brain was. Damon effing Dealer. I just got to say it, dude. You look fit. Your metabolism must be off the charts right now. Like... And that P90X offer... ...stands for life. Feel unlimited. I love you so much. Okay. Alright. Tits-ey. Mitzi. What do you do for a living? Oh I'm in school. I just got my Masters in Psychology. And now I'm working on my PhD at Phoenix Online. Oh PhD. Doctor. Doctors are smart. Very very smart. Okay. Why don't we run some tests? Okay. Why don't we not? I think I've seen enough. You guys are great. Yeah. Let's run some EVP. Hell yeah! You down with EVP? Yeah. You know me. Who's down with EVP? All of my homies... WHAT? I caught her that time. I'm so... Whoa! Alright. Thank you. Yes. We'll do the EVP. We can do the EVP. Alright? But I swear to you: If we don't find any sort of paranormal activity... Then we're going to leave. End of story. Okay? We're going to do the burial ground. Hello, evil entity. Can you hear me? Is Patrick Swayze there? Are you friends with Patrick Swayze? Hello, evil entity. Can you hear me? Electronic Voice Phenomenon. See, With demons, we all know they're very powerful creatures. They're large, they have razor sharp teeth. Claws, the whole nine. For whatever reason, though, they have very weak diaphragms. And so when it comes to electronics, their voices just don't carry very well. So what we do is, we blow up the files. And we basically look for any sort of speed bumps. But I wouldn't worry about it. No no. I see one coming up. I now have in my possession a baby. And I am in a corner. I'm going to put the baby in the corner. Does Patrick have anything to say to me now? What'd he say? I couldn't hear that. Give me one second. Let me slow it down. You're a dick. Did you do that? No man. Wasn't me. What is your favorite food? Pizza. Who is going to win the World Series? Yankees. How sure are you? Bet the house. If you could have one super power, what would it be? Flying. No. Wait. See the future. If they turned your life into a movie what actor would play you? Matthew McConaughey. Knock knock. Who's there? Atch. Atch who? God bless you. Ahhh. You tricked me. Redheads, brunettes, or blonde? Smallsquatch not picky. Houston, we have confirmation. EVP. It's probably the easiest trick in the book. All you've got to do is drop the octaves down a little bit. Or you can put a filter on it. Which is what I usually do. But, that's what I do. Yeah. Semantics. Oh my god. Brock. You idiot! What? I didn't do anything. What was the "it" that the river ran through? I never got that. Oh my god! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! THAT PAN FLEW OFF THE COUNTER. DAMNIT, DEWEY. THIS WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S! No no no no! BUT I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! We've got to get out of here. She's a monster. No, Damon. Come on. Damon, Damon, Damon, Damon. What are you doing, man? Two of hearts. You've got to be kidding me. Dude. That girl needs professional help. She could hurt someone. She could hurt herself. Your turn. Yeah... Some taped over footage there. It's a little embarrassing when Damon provided me with the tapes to shoot the documentary. And no one checked to see if they were his own home videos. So... Absolutely not. Hold your voice, man. The cameras are going to hear you. It doesn't matter if they can HEAR US. Okay? They can read everything we're saying. What are you talking about? How? - I'm not guessing it. - Come on. - I'm not guessing it. - Come on. I am not guessing. - You know how much this project means to me. - Exactly. If you go through with this... Okay. It's dark where you are. We're fine. I'm more than willing to step to the plate. I can run this show. You're lost. If this ship is going to sink, I'm going to be the guy who drowns us. You remember. Don't think. Come on. You can figure this out. You just have to let go and believe. Believe. I... You know what? I've got a better idea. Yeah. OH, do you like that? Alright guys. Let's quiet down. Let's focus. We're losing daylight. Alright. We need to figure out a game to... guys! Come on. Let's get real here. Communication is the most important C in the C system. As you all very well know. So if we're going to get rid of this demon, we've got to know what it wants. Guys! Brock. Can you get serious? My bad, bro. Please. Does this face look serious to you? Does this face look serious to you? ANSWER ME! Yeah. I need you this serious. Alright. Pepper. Blair, Doug. I need you guys to go out into the woods. I need you to set up camp, alright? We're looking for anything that looks like a Bigfoot habitat. - You've got it. - Yeah. Tuck, me and you, Brock, we'll stick around with Dewey and Mitzi. We'll set up paranormal phone lines around the house. Alright? Does anybody have any questions? Yeah. Are we looking... Are we looking for a midget yeti? Or a Bigfoot dwarf? Uhm... Because The Abominable Snowman, which a lot of people know as the yeti, is thought to be native to the northern Himalayas. Whereas the sasquatch, which a lot of people know as Bigfoot, is thought to be from the Pacific Northwest. So... It's just like... Wait, so... Are you looking for an actual answer to that question? Or are you just asking it out loud to sound really smart to everybody? It... well, yeah. - It's... - The second one, right? Yeah. No, that's what I thought. And to answer your question, you're an idiot. It's just there's a difference. That's all. Doug's an idiot. He is. He really is. That's what you look for in a good camera operator. Like Shark Week. It's a bunch of idiots jumping in the water. Hey. Whatever it takes. Looking for a physical manifestation of any sort of yeti or a bigfoot or a sasquatch. Right? It's a demon. Right? It's a spirit. I mean, how many times have we done this thing before? Alright. Let's quit acting like amateurs and start acting like professionals. Hell yeah! - Can I get an amen? - Amen! Let's get ourselves a demon. Love you. - Have fun. - Thank you. For what? For letting me prove to the world that Smallsquatch really exists. For reaffirming that my life has a purpose. For keeping hope alive. I think I might die without hope. Oh shit. Language! Dude, why would you mess with the EVP without consulting with me? Because I knew you wouldn't let me. Of course I'm not going to let you. You're an idiot. You are nothing in the game of life, bro. Whoa whoa whoa! Slow your roll man. Nothing. You seriously need to lose the attitude. Stress will kill you. I might lose my girlfriend out of this. - How am I supposed to feel? - Get over it. - This is a good thing for us. - How? Bro. You are going to be remembered as one of the greatest illusionists of all time. Houdini, Tupac Shakur, Penn and Teller, Elvis Presley. Damon Dealer. I mean, this could make our fan base triple bro. Let me ask you something. Do you ever think of anything other than our fan base? No. I don't. And that's exactly why I'm going to be the most famous man in the world. Let me tell you something, guy. There is a reason that I am the most famous, super, gigantic, mega famous person in the world. Okay? So you want to be like me? Try being great at something. I'm great at being famous. I'll show you. I'll show everybody. I'm going to be like the Kardashian baby, whose real daddy is the president, who is best friends with Suri, who has 500 million fans on facebook and twitter, and has an affair with Prince William's daughter. And if he has twins, I'm going to smash on both of them. Why? Because I'm Brock, bitch. Oh shit. We're like The A Team, fool. Army Ranger teammates. And I need you to bring your A game. Can you do that for me? It is what it is. - Rome wasn't built in a day. - Let go. Let God. - Put up or shut up. - Let it all hang out. - Every dog has his day. - Go big or go home. - A penny saved is a penny earned. - Boys will be boys. - Let me run the show on this one. - Absolutely not. Damnit. So Pepper, what's like, the biggest game you ever shot? Biggest? Or wildest? Both. Biggest was a giraffe. Shut up! - You shot a giraffe? - Yeah. I was on a safari in South Africa. That big son of a gun stuck his tongue out at me and made me so mad. POW! Caught him right in the throat. Which makes sense when you think about it. Seeing as a giraffe is mostly throat. - That is crazy. - Right. What was the wildest? Garden gnome. - Shut up! - I won't. What was that like? I mean like... A garden gnome? There ain't much to eat there. - No? - No. No. It's kind of like a beef jerky. Tough... spicy. But it's got a lot of protein though. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. I reckon one of them would really hit the spot after a nice workout. Chop one of them little gnome fellas up, throw em in a blender maybe a little banana in there or something, maybe some giraffe venison. That right there'll hit the spot. That'll get it done. It'll get her done. Okay, but... How did you get the gnome out? Because gnomes are mythological creatures. Yeah. Yeah. What's up? Well, you can pretty much kill anything. So long as you got the right bait. - Bait? - Bait. What kind of bait did you use to get the gnome out? Yeah. Well... Unlike... I like to keep my secrets. Well... Looks like she's done. I like to call this guy Alvin. You guys want some? - You sure? - Yeah. - Wow. - You're missing out. Dear God, thank you for Alvin. Now he is dead. I'm going to eat him. Then go to bed. - DOUG! - What? Oh god. Now I'm coming. I'm cumming. I can't... DOUG, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Doug, get over here! Seriously, hurry up! Wait till you see this! A rock formation! OH MY GOD. IT'S A PILE OF ROCKS! Oh god! I want to hold you. Hold me. Hey! HEY! - I'm... - HEY! I'm disappointed in you. Have you done your quiet time? - Well I was in the middle of it. - Well you can finish it. You could do all things. Corinthians 4:13 I'll go finish. A pile of rocks. Oldest trick in the book. God, it works every time. And why is that? Well, you know, I think everybody knows that witches, above every other intelligent creature, love to stack rocks. Sandstone, magma, etc. You know? What? You think Stonehenge happened by itself? Please. Please. People always ask me. Well they don't actually always ask me. But I imagine them asking me questions, you know? Like, "How do you put a bunch of rocks together" "and stack them up and make people think" "witch?" And the answer is, teamwork. That's how you do it. Look. If you want something done right, you go ask an expert, right? Because there's a good chance that you're an idiot. And you don't know what you're doing. Can you show that to me one more time? That last little bit? So what makes Addy such an expert? Well, you know, kids are more advanced than adults in a lot of ways. It's like you're on a hay ride. You know, it's like their imagination hasn't been destroyed by their stupid parents or their jerk bosses. You know? It hasn't been bludgeoned by crystal meth, high speed chicken feed, crank, crack cocaine, glass, ice, In a lot of ways, kids are geniuses. Right Addie? I just pooted. It just doesn't make any sense to me. What doesn't make any sense to you? I mean, if Smallsquatch wants something, why doesn't he just say so? Seriously dude. Why does he have to go all creeper status? Guys. The communication process is different with demons. Okay? They don't have iPhones, or gmail, or any of that stuff. Well I know. It just seems like it should be easier. Well, there is one way to expedite the communication process. Out in my car, right now, I have a Ouija board. - NO! NO WAY MAN. - No Ouija. - No. No way. - Hell no. It's not going to happen. It's not there. The feeling isn't. It's not there. Always offer the Ouija. They never go for the Ouija. Guys, relax. Okay. Relax. I'm sorry. It was a bad idea. I'm not going to bring the Ouija board inside. Yeah. You've got to get rid of that bull spit. - That's the devil's keyboard. - No. I know. Absolutely. Absolutely. You know what? In fact, I'm going to go out in my car right now. I'm just going to burn it. No! No! No sir, Bob. - That's not happening. - Oh my gosh. I can put a candle to it. Always offer to burn the Ouija. They never go for burning the Ouija. Okay. Night two. I'm going to be crashing here with Mitzi and Dewey. Let's see what happens. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh god. Oh shit yeah. These are pretty. Worth some money. - Damnit Dewey! - Mitzi! You okay? You left the toilet seat up again! Freaking idiot. My ass is all wet. GOD. What are you doing? I don't know. Just getting... Pepper... coverage. Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa. Blair, are you seeing this? This is fake, right? Please tell me this is fake. Some magic's real. Did you just have a thing? Did you just have a psychic thing? What did it say? What did it say? We're all going to die. No! Oh my god. Did you see Blair's outfit? Tacky much? I mean, seriously, she looks like a Christmas tree. I know. I just want to like throw a bunch of gifts at her feet. I mean, maybe we could take a star, and put it on her head. Oh, that would be perfect. Like some ornaments too, all around her. I mean, Blair dear, honestly... I hope you've been a really good girl. Because Santa needs to bring you a whole new wardrobe. Oh my god. - You are so awful. - Yeah. AWFULLY delicious! Tasty. Coconut. What does that mean? It means he'll eat anything. - WHOA! WHOA! - Whoa. Whoa. - Is that the Smallsquatch? - No. It's Danny. Put the gun down. Hey. What's up? Hello. Hello? Blair, can you hold on a second? I can't hear you. You're just going to whip a shotgun on us? Guns are supposed to kill things. It's what I do. I'm a cold blooded killer. You really think the Smallsquatch is going to call her up on her iPhone? Yeah. Basically he can call anyone, anywhere, on the 4G network. Oh please, man. The Smallsquatch wouldn't do that. He'd pick up a GoPhone. Those things are untraceable. You use em, you throw em away. Like the wire. What about now? Can you hear me? Yeah. Much better. What's going on? I wanted to see how you're doing. Oh my GOD it's amazing. We found rock formations yesterday. And just now, we found stick men hanging from the trees. Wow. Wow. That's crazy. I know. I think we're really close to nailing the little bastard. What about you? Are you having any luck? Yeah. Well... Yeah. You know. It's alright. - Hey Blair. - What? Listen. I'm sorry. Sorry about what? Damon, come quick! Oh my god. There's some writing in the powder. On the floor. Blair, I've got to call you back. Yeah. I love you. Babe... Babe. Babe! What is this? Latin? Dewey... It is Latin. For, "She is way out of your league." Get out. You know Latin? It's English, Dewey. It is. It's just not very good English. It says, "seance." Oh. That's it. Demons have roughly the IQ that of about a 3rd grader. Why is that? Well... Demons work three jobs: Steal, kill, destroy. I mean, where does a classroom fit into that? You know? It just goes to show you, there is never enough time. Even for eternal beings. Right Brock? I have 3.2% body fat. Alright. Remember. He's a deceiver. So he'll do whatever it takes to stay in my body. So when he shows himself, I need you to drag him back to hell. Alright? Is everybody ready? SMALLSQUATCH! WE COME TO HEAR YOUR MESSAGE! Speak now. Or forever HOLD YOUR PEACE. I think I'm the only guy in the world that prefers an off kiltered table. I'm Spartacus. No! I am Spartacus. NO! I am Spartacus. I see gold digger demon's already been here, sonny. Smallsquatch! It's time for you to bounce, bro. NO! NO! No! Mr. Funny Pants. Funny Pants, are you? Why are you here? Yeah. What do you want? How about a biscuit? What? A BISCUIT! Alright, dude. What do you want on your biscuit? The works. What's that? Like butter? Oh yeah. Jelly? Grape, please. Grape. Good choice. Good choice. What about gravy? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I could eat the shit out of some biscuits and gravy right now. Me too, dude. Can't hold on much longer... No... GET OUT OF THERE, SONNY. AIN'T NOBODY COMING OUT OF THERE BUT ME, SIR. ENOUGH! That's it. Smallsquatch I command you to go back to the pits of hell in the name of Jesus Christ, lord and savior of all that's pure and holy. Leave him, Jesus! NO! Okay. Remember. He's a deceiver. He'll do whatever it takes to take over my body. That's why he's doing this. So when he shows himself, I need you to send him back to hell. Alright? Is everybody ready? You literally just said that. Mission accomplished. Infrared. Didn't even get to use it. And what's the game plan now? Well, we wait for Blair to show up. She should be back in the morning. Do you know where they're at? No, I mean... Not exactly, but Pepper does. You know. And you know, the thing with him is, he doesn't seem very bright. But he's pretty street smart. And you know, street smarts come in handy when you're... ...in the middle of the woods. So where are we? About eight miles south west of base camp. Latitude 27 degrees 54 minutes Longitude -97 degrees 33 minutes You can seriously tell that from that needle? Oh no. GPS. Let's motivate. Hey... Hey baby. Hey. What's going on? I miss you. We're almost done. Yeah. I know, I know. I just... I wish I could be out there with you right now. You are out here with me. I am? Yeah. I'm lying in your arms, pressed up against you. Can you feel me? I think I can. I'm brushing your ridiculous emo hair from your eyes. I put a hand on your inner thigh. Oh! I work my way up towards your sweet and sour. I reach down... And I grab your denim bulge. I like that. I rub your taco like a rabbit's foot. Like a genie lamp, baby. My fingers... they dance... ..along your garden snake. You mean my South American bushmaster. You get bigger... and bigger... and bigger... I sprout like a bean stalk. Jack's bean stalk, baby! I bite your neck. Ow. Not so hard. I bite harder. Wait. Are we doing this thing rough tonight? What'd I tell you about asking questions? My bad. My bad, my bad. I bury your head in a pillow. Yeah. Bury me, baby. - Your ass is like a pound cake. - Yeah. It hurts so good. I can't control the muscles in my face. They contort... ...into an ugly face. Oh god. Your ugly face is so hot, baby. I turn you back over and I kiss the shit out of your ugly face. Only... We don't kiss. Our open mouths collide. And we stay there. Connected. Oh my god. You're like Jackie Kerouac. You give yourself to me. I breathe you in. Like a respirator. I hold you tight. My body shudders. My butt cheeks clench. I peak. We collapse into tiny particles. We disappear forever. Into the stars. - Like astronauts. - Astronauts. How was that for you? It was like a 7. - 7 and a half. - 8 and a half. - 8. - 8.25 - 8.125 - 8.1625 - 8.153125 - 8.153125. Yep. Totally an 8.153125.

Emergency! Come on! Go where? This is such BS, bro. They're scandalous. I swear, they do anything to be popular. Yeah. Especially pretend to be possessed. Hey, it's Clair. I knew you'd call. And that's why I didn't answer. Just kidding. Leave a message after the beep. Blair, hey, it's me. Listen. There's been some trouble with Emily Sunflower. Luckily, I packed my exorcism kit. Just call me when you get this, or come by as soon as possible. Oh thank God you're here. Where is she? How long has she been like this? Since we called you. You've got something... in your teeth. Yeah. Yeah. No, up. It's like a piece of chicken. Like a thigh. Or like a chicken wing. No. On the right side. My right or your right? No. Let's see. Your right. Yep. There you go. You got it. Thanks. I hate when people leave me hanging in public. Oh. Me too. It's the worst! So embarrassing. Tell me about it. Tell me about it. I mean. You think, "Hey. There's my friend. They're going to help me out." You go shopping together. Maybe leave little comments on my facebook wall. They're very complimentary. But they never tell you when you got something stuck in your teeth. - Not a real friend. - No. They're not. Anyways. You'll be needing these. Yeah. Get your feet there. Son of a. You see what he's doing here? That water starts to boil... It means your daughter's got the demon in her. Out of the way. No. No, stop! STOP IT! No you didn't! - Dang! - Ew! Hey. I've been looking for that. Ew! Is that a blowdryer? No. It's a blowing dryer. It's blowing your mind, isn't it? What do you want me to cough up next? A snow blowing? Ew! Is that DVD? Blow, starring Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz. It should have been you, Danny. What should have been me? You didn't even come to my funeral. What are you talking about? Duck. Duck. Duck. Duck.

BLAIR! - What? - Get out. - What? - Get out. Come here. - Oh my god. WHAT? - What? What's going on? - Pepper's gone. What do you mean, "Pepper's Gone."? I don't know. He's not here. Okay. Where is he? - Oh my god. Let's go. Come on. - Wait. - Come on! - Wait! Wait. Wait over there. I just realized. What? What what? We're in the most haunted woods in the world. Oh my god. You're right! - Come on! - Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Are you okay? - Doug, are you okay? - Oh my god. - What's wrong? - Too much shaking cam. I have to take my dramamine. Give me the camera. Jesus... That was really disgusting. Oh god. I can't be around that. Doug! Doug! Hold on. Wait. I think I see something. Oh my god. Pepper! If we don't start living together, we're going to die alone. We have to go back, Kate. We have to go BACK! Look. I don't know what you want from me. Alright? For all we know, this is some sort of practical joke. Mr. Dealer, with all due respect, You and I both know that that little girl in there ain't my little girl. Oh no no. That's right. She's possessed by a demon. I forget. Bro. Think about it. Oh come on. You too? The greatest illusion the devil ever pulled off... ...was convincing the world that he disappeared. You just misquoted the SHI out of that right now. Like, it wasn't even close. Mr. Dealer, I'd do anything for my daughter. I'd stab myself 57 times in the gut if it meant I could free her from that demon. I'd eat a buffalo's nut sack for breakfast every day for the rest of my life. I'd have premarital sex without a condom. - In Africa! - Jesus. I'd sleep with a leper while a swarm of bees stung me in the face. Okay. I get it. I get it. You are crazy. And I get that. I like that. But what is your point? Have you ever loved someone like that? I'm going to need to gear up. Gear. up. montage. So. freaking. cool. Like, beyond cool. You have no idea how much I love gear up montages. Also, guess who got a new camera baby? Eat your heart out, Tuck Thomas. Come on guys. Guess. Just one guess. One guess. I dare you. - I dare you to guess. - Shut up, Dewey. I'll tell you who it's not. Billy Boobs Thornton over here, who can't even operate the microwave. But seriously. Our love is eternal, but, our survey about the camera says... He'll be fine. He always is. Alright. Now before we get started, I have to warn you. Mr. Sunflower, your daughter may be possessed by multiple demons. Multiple demons? That's right. So when we get rid of this one, another one may come and take its place after we leave. And it's not that we weren't successful at getting rid of this one. We were. We were very, very successful. I've never missed a free throw. It's just that another one came and took its place. See? Multiple demons. Multiple demons. That's right. Is everybody ready? Let's do this. Let's go. Blow hand demon. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Jobe?" "A perfect and upright man." "One that feareth God and askeweth evil." The Lord said to Jobe, "I will strike down with furious vengeance" "and furious anger" "and furious fury" "upon thy demons," "on teenage demons," "on mutant demons," "on teenage mutant ninja demons!" What? Jobe? Seriously? You're trying to cast me out with the Book of Jobe? Yes. What's wrong with that? That guy was a weak sauce. Oh come on. He was not weak sauce. Okay? He was a nice guy. He was a nice guy! Okay? The devil put him through the ringer. Don't put that on us. We had permission on that one. Oh right. Permission. Permission. Permit this! Yeah! Now that's what I'm talking about. God, that's not funny. I just did my makeup. I thought you said it was holy water. Got it on Craigslist. You know how that goes. Oh, you're the worst! The power of Sprite compels you. The power of Sprite compels you! Obey your thirst, demon. OBEY YOUR THIRST! Oww. My back. Mr. Sunflower, no. Girl, you are tight. I think you're okay. Mr. Dealer, the cross! That's right. Corner three, corner three. The trade. Down here. No no. Pass it good news. Pass it good news. Three, two, one. PASS THE FREAKING CROSS. It's hot! That's it. Give it to her, brother. Mr. Dealer, no sir. No sir. We're talking about my little girl here. - No? - No sir. Yeah right. Softer. Okay. Alright. Here. Softer. Softer. Okay. Now swing away. Mr. Dealer, swing away. NO! Hook. Give her the hook. See that? That's right. Yeah. Yeah! Banana noogie. Smells fruity in here. It smells fruity in here, demon. No! Yes. Never! EAT IT. This is... bananas! Nothing like this has ever happened before. Keep going. Keep going. This is awesome. You bitch! I command you to leave this girl in the name of God. Blair, Blair, quite contrare. I command you to leave this girl's body. In God's name. Too bad she wants to live. But then again, who doesn't? I command you to leave this girl's body. In the name of Jesus Christ. Is she going to be alright? Emily? She's fine. She's going to be fine. You're going to be alright, baby. Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus! Hallelujah. You've been delivered from evil. Let's get you home, baby. Brock. We have to go get Blair. Hell no, man. Did you see this shit? You're on your own. There's some crazy people out in the woods. Good luck with that. Suit yourself. TUCK! What?! Wait wait. Hold on. I sense an evil presence. Oh god. Oh my god. We're going to disappear! Here. Give me the camera. I'm going to use the light to lead us back. You know... that people who disappear... ...suffer the worst deaths. Not everyone who disappears dies. Yes they do. Their limbs get severed. And their kneecaps get smashed in. And their bowels get ripped out. And their larynxes get crushed. The larynx. I'm very fond of my larynx. Yeah. I noticed! Just relax. Okay? No one is going to crush your larynx or smash your kneecaps. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT! Yes. Actually I do. I'm psychic. Remember? Okay. Sure. So... Then what's going to happen? The same thing that happens to everybody. We're going to find our way. We're going to go some place beautiful. Like a beach. I can... a nudey beach? Yeah. You know, it'll have loose guys and... clear waters and... white sand... - And big old boobies? - Yeah. Palm trees... dangling wangs. Little huts... ...just nonchalantly swinging from side to side. There will be eagles... ...and hammocks. I can hear the waves and the birds. Can you? Doug? DOUG? DOUG?! DOUG! BLAIR! That's it. I've got a minute left on my last tape. I'm calling it. We're done. Blair! We're done here. We're never going to find her out here. Yes we are. Look. It's like finding a needle in a hay stack. And I don't want to get lost. Dude, for the last time, we are not lost. No no no. You don't understand. I said I don't want to GET lost. Dude, how could we possibly get lost? We're animals, alright? We're in the woods. Alright? This is... This is our backyard. I play around in this place all the time. Oh my GOD, you got us LOST. DOUG! DOUG! No! No! No! Not the kneecaps. No! Not the kneecaps. Blair! Doug! You bitch! You lied to me. No. I had no idea. - You are the WORST psychic EVER. - What? You're awful! Hey! I honestly cannot think of a worse possible psychic than you. You might still make it out alive. No! He's killing me! He's definitely killing me! - Where are you? - I don't know. OH NO. NO! Not the larynx. Not the larynx. NO! Chop off my cock! Take my cock! Leave me... not the larynx. NO! NO! We are not lost. Okay? This is America, my friend. America. Unbelievable, man. My ancestors paid cash money for this land. Okay? $24 Manhattan. Look it up. Unbelievable. You know what? You don't get it. Alright? George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Winston Churchill, Sarah Palin. This land is your land, bro. This land is my land. Ben Franklin flew a kite so you could be here. Of the icy... You're impossible to believe, Damon! Beyond belief. Oh my god. Would you stop with the belief stuff? "Unbelievable. Beyond belief." Blah blah blah. "Believe, believe, believe." It's like you're trying to tell me something. Believe? Believe. Nice. Shh. Shut up. Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe. Oh yeah? Are you going to try that gypsy stuff on me? You're delusional! And the Tuck Thomas cinematic voyage is going to sail away without you and your soon to be canceled joke of a television show. What's that light? My god. What is that? Brock? Rise, little ye of big faith. Rise. The Smallsquatch lives. Rise! It doesn't make any sense. Mitzi? Rise ye, great demon yeti. Well yeah, actually, I can totally see that one. Rise. Oh my god. He is such a tool. The editor?! This is just getting ridiculous. Rise, Smallsquatch. Rise! RISE! Oh my god. DAMON! Damon! Believe. Believe. Believe. Damon! Believe. I've got you now. Blair! Blair. Blair, are you okay? Blair. Well well well. Lookie what we have here. If it isn't Damon Dealer. I think you just accidentally hit me, bro. That's the way the cookie crumbles. It's time for a change, Danny boy. I'm the man now. That one kind of felt like you did it on purpose. Of course it was. And now I'm going to kill you. Kill me? Too many cooks spoil the soup, bro. What are you talking about? It's just water over the bridge. Dude, you just misquoted the shit out of that right now... I guess the price is wrong. Bitch. Billy Madison... Try Happy Gilmore. Oh yeah. No. Yeah. You're right. You got me. Happy Gilmore. Definitely Happy Gilmore. Why are you doing this, bro? What choice did I have? You wouldn't let me run the show. - Damon! - Get off me. They're over here! You were going to tell the whole world it was fake. And I just made it real. It's my show now, Damon. Time for you to take a breather. Blair. Are you okay? Run, babe. Run! Well alright, alright, alright, McConaughey. You just suffered some Old Testament justice. - Oh no. - What? What's wrong? I can't get the... - The camera light went out. - Turn it back on. I can't get it to work. Here. I'll just turn on the light. Blair... You're more woman than I deserve. Look. I don't care about the stupid show. I don't care about being famous. I don't care about your past. I just... I want you to be happy. And I'd do anything for you. I'd slay a dragon for you. Alright. Like a mean one. Like a real mean one. Not a nice one like Puff. Alright? Like a big, badass one that talks. Alright? And I say that with full confidence. Because dragons don't actually exist. Not one of them. Not at all. If you ever got Hodgkin's lymphoma, I would cut you open, and I would suck that sweet cancer right out of your body. Every last bit of it. Like a vampire. If you paralyzed yourself, because you jumped off a diving board, and you broke your back, I would wheel you 500 miles and I would wheel you 500 more. Just to be the guy who wheeled you a thousand miles. To go see a doctor to fix your back. Because you broke it. When you jumped off the diving board and you paralyzed yourself. If you had a penis, like if one day I found out, like, "Whoa. There's a set of nuts." "And a penis she'd been hiding from me." "She did a terrific job tucking." I would move to California. And we would still make it legal. Yeah. I would marry you if you were a dude. Do you feel the same? I'd die for you, baby. God. Should we make a run for it? Okay. Come on. Come on. I mean, the pockets. They're too small. I don't even know where I'm going to hide my dignity. Things that I do for you. "The King said, turning to the jury..." If we die, we die. Tut tut, child. Everything's got a moral. If only you can find it. DANNY! "I wonder if I've been changed in the night." "Let me think." "Was I the same when I got up this morning?" "I can almost think that I can remember" "feeling a little different." "But if I'm not the same," "then the next question is: Who in the world am I?" "Ah, that's the great puzzle." DANNY! BLAIR, NO! BLAIR! BLAIR! You did good today. Yeah. I bet you say that to all the wabbits. I'm proud of you. This isn't happening. This isn't happening. No! Stop it! No no no! Stop it! Every time you turn that thing on, it feels like you're taking our work home with us. I know, but I want our eight kids to see us when we're young and beautiful. We got kids. Right. Well you keep praying for that. So what do you want to watch? - Cloverfield? - No. What about... The Sixth Sense? No. Wait. What? - I've got an idea. - What? Do you trust me? I trust you. Do you love me? I love you. People who disappear suffer the worst deaths. Not everyone who disappears dies. You disappear forever. We're going to go some place beautiful. Like a beach. The greatest illusion the devil ever pulled off was convincing the world that he disappeared. Blue skies, and clear water. And palm trees. Little huts. Bro. You are going to be remembered as one of the greatest illusionists of all time. Houdini, Tupac Shakur, Penn and Teller, Elvis Presley, Damon Dealer. Eat your heart out, M. Knight. What just happened? Don't be that guy. Was it a trick ending? Were you paying attention? I have a headache. - That ending was our idea. - It was. Www dot trick ending connection dot edu Little brat stole it from us. We're going to sue his ass for billions. Yeah. Billions. Lawsuit. Shoot. American Idol? I'm going to come out with a show next year, and call it, A False Idol. The winner gets to burn in a lake. A fiery lake. Obviously a regular lake would do the opposite effect. If they were on fire to begin with. We play all kinds of sports. Table tennis, foosball, Bocce ball, tether ball. Anything with balls. If we invented chess, it would've had balls. Yeah. It only would've been made for not nerds. And we both would've lettered. Am I going to come rip in? NO! No! Do I come and rip down your fucking lights? In the middle of the scene? - I was just checking my lights. - Okay. No. Then why the fuck are you going to walk through? Like this? In the middle of the scene? What the fuck is it with you? What don't you fucking understand? Talk to me about Grey's Anatomy. The only anatomy I want to be focused on is God's anatomy. The Father, The Son, and The Holy Ghost. Shoot. If Lazzarus had Gregory House as doctor, we would've never even heard of the son of a gun. Believe that. Oh good for you! Good for you. And how was it? I hope it was fucking good. Because it's useless now, isn't it? Unbelievable. Fucking amateur, man. You know, I think I want a smallsquatch. They're SO cute. Do you want daddy to get you a cute cuddly little Squatchey? Yes, daddy. You are so precious. I just want to take off all your clothes. And put you over a stove right now. Stoves are hot. Maybe flip you like a pancake. I'll make you sizzle like some bacon. Sizzle! Let's go again. No! Let's not take a minute! LET'S GO AGAIN! And let's not have YOU walking through it. Unbelievable. Un fucking believable. The amount of times he's strolling the fuck around in the background. I've never had a DP behave like this. The Olympics told us to go home to give everyone else a fair shot. Yeah. I could drink ten beers and beat Michael Phelps in rowing. I could drink 12 beers and beat Marion Jones in ball chess. We're not saying you have to be twins in order to be a great scholar athlete. Oh no. No. But, it helps. No! Quit trashing my set. Quit trashing my scene! Am I going to trash your lights? Am I going to trash them? Then quit trashing my scene! You are trashing my scene! Fuck. Real Housewives of Orange County. More like Real Housewives of Jerusalem. Got married, Mary Magdelene. Of course they'd be easy to cast because nobody knew who they were. Because her face is covered up. You're a nice guy! You're a nice guy! But that don't cut it, when you're fucking bullshitting around, fucking around on set. What? Oh. Yeah? You think this is one person? Haven't heard that one before! - Whoa. - How they doing that? I can't believe it! They've got the same guy playing two parts. It's a twin. How you doing that? Boy! Technology. It's really going places in the movie biz. Wow! If I was the same guy, how am I going to do that? Same guy slap himself. Yeah. How is he doing that? How is he doing that to himself? - God! How is he doing that? - Yeah. Yeah. Same guy. Same guy playing his own twin. - Punch himself. - How do they do that? - Right in the boobie. - How do they do that? Iron Chef? I got a different show. It's called God Chef. We all just prepare communion. How to chop up a little bread. Little bit of wine. Just do it in remembrance of me. Bam! Show's over. God's happy. Two and a Half Men. Never mind. I can't be the only person to not do a Charlie Sheen joke, right? Shoot. I didn't know sitcoms were revelations. Two and a Half Men. More like three men. Jesus, God, and The Holy Ghost. I mean technically, they're kind of the same. Which lends itself to the Two and a Half Men part. Plus, the ghost is more of a spirit. Which is kind of half a man. Either way, we're all living together. And peace and harmony to you. And we'll walk in the golden streets of... Graceland. No.
