But keep this in mind: as he changed schools the last quarter, passing will be hard for him. Very hard. We know that, right, Jordi? You have a good record. Yes, sir. Congratulations. Try hard and be responsible and all that will be gained. He's a good student and never gets into trouble. Mom... Sorry, I'm running late. It's my first day at work and I want to be on time. Of course... Julia. Yes, Julia. We're finished anyway. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I thought we wouldn't find a school. The hospital position came up overnight and changing cities and our home... It's all gone so fast that... Thank you so much. We're just doing our job. Can you go with them? So your birthday's December 30th. You're the youngest in class. Thank you so much, really. And you know the deal. Yeah, I know. Goodbye. OK, Jordi, shall we? Good morning. This is Jordi. Give him a hand and help him with all he needs. OK? This is 1st degree. If it was 2nd degree, what would we get when drawing it? Jordi? A parabola. And if it was a 1/X function? A hyperbole. Very good, Jordi. You can sit down. So where do you live? Near the park, in the building with the gardens. And the street name? Do you two live around here? You gonna finger yourself here while you stare at him? Go to hell. You, new guy! Hoy you doing? Careful, he's an animal. My name's Nacho. -And they're Joan... -What's up? Marcos and David. Joan, give Jordi a cigarette. -No, I gave it up. Thanks. -"Thanks". Cool guy. Will you shut up? Don't listen to him. -And joints? -No. Nothing? So what do you do? Jerk off all day? Play basketball. I'm a guard. Nacho, time to go. And you come with us. I saw your file, you like this. Come on. Nacho! What are you doing, dude? What are you doing Nacho? Come on, get out. Up you go. You're on the team. -Good morning. -Good morning. Good morning. Tell your dad I don't want any more drilling. Sorry, we're moving in and... And make that fucking dog stop barking. Tell him, OK? What a neighbor. Weird, isn't he? Know what his name is? Freddy Krueger. You're so silly. Give me a kiss. The hospital let me take half a day off. My boss says there are and I'll be on call a lot. We need the money. The psychiatrist said to keep your mind occupied. There you go. You'll be on call. And school? How'd it go? Fine. Well, thing is there are these guys that... What's that about school? You were crying. Jordi, you know I had to leave there, right? Of course. That city and that apartment without your dad.... Come on, don't think about it. Don't you see everything will be OK? Come on, Birria. -om, stop. -Why? What's wrong? That. Freddy Krueger. It's OK, I'll go. I warned you, kid. Get your dad out here. Yes, who are you? Your husband? Get him out here, we'll settle this now. I'm in charge here. Then listen up. If I hear hammering again, shitty music or barking, I'll make your life hell until you leave. And not whining to the neighbors. Look, the music's mine, OK? I'll wear headphones, so... Drop it. Don't worry. He's crazy. And drunk. We should just avoid him. "Maximum daily dose: -Pour it all in. -All? All of it. Marcos, what's the matter? These guys drank my water. Sit down. Continue with your exam. Game's on. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Man, you're really pale. And sweaty. I can't hold it in! Nacho, let me in. Chill, the toilets are all full. -Where you going? -What is this? Guys, he's doing it in his pants. Look! -What a pig. -That's disgusting. It reeks. That's enough. Jordi, come on. Come on, move. Sorry, you have to eat alone again. There's pasta in the oven. -Pasta? -Yeah. Don't worry, I'll live. Mom. Yeah? Did you take your pills? Yeah, of course. It's that obvious I was crying? And those clothes? I had basketball at the last minute. OK. Bye. Bye. Birria, no. Fuck off! Beat it, you rat! There's no reason to react like that. Tell me, does pissing people off all the time run in the family? Answer me, dammit. Fucking say something! Stop smoking. That's how my grandfather died. What the fuck do I have to do with him? Eh? Nothing. I'm gonna go. So you ruin my harmony with the universe and now you want to just go? What are we doing? My place to see a movie? Not your place. Your dad always hassles us. -Since your mom took off... -My dad's under control. And don't talk about my mom. Yeah. Your dad's last "control". -Fuck, Paula. What are you doing? -It's not my fault. -Why are you so serious? -Me? Come on... School. It's hard getting used to it. Don't worry. It's just the beginning. What's up, Jordi? So you don't say hi? Hi. -Hi. -Hi. He's cute. -ls she your mom? -Yes. Hi. -You live around here, right? -Yes. We're neighbors. I live right next door. So close, that's great. Stay with them. I'm fine. I wanna see something at the market. Come take a walk around the port. No, not now. Thanks. Well we're gonna go. See you on Monday. -Bye. -Bye. You could be a little kinder, no? They seem very nice. How's philosophy going? I need to get it in gear. I'm more worried about the English exam. Jordi! -I wanna talk to you. -What do you want? Well look... Our joke the other day... We went too far. You did. Way too far. Come on, Jordi. Listen, dude. Come on. Please. Jordi. Look... I don't know... If you want, hop on my scooter. We live next to each other. Come on. I just want to drive you home. I swear. -He doesn't know what he's in for. -It's up to him. OK, I'm out of here. Thanks. You're welcome. Jordi! Can I have my helmet back? Look, my birthday's this Saturday. You're invited. You can come if you want. OK. Sure. What's up? Hear all the noise? Nacho's dad is out. It's gonna be a blast. Come on in. Nachete, look who's here. Dude, Jordi! Happy birthday. I brought you this. -You really didn't need to. -I just downloaded it. Hope you like it. Man, what a shitty fucking present. And today isn't my birthday. But I invited you to liven up the party. -Go to hell. -Jordi, what's the matter? -Aren't you the big nice guy? -Go to hell. I'll go to hell but you're not leaving. Since you're here, let's play. Let me go! -Drink it now! -You're getting me wet! I'm not smoking that! Dance with Paula. Dance with Paula. No way! Fucking wait a minute. -I'm leaving, Paula. -No, no. I said I'm leaving! -Asshole -I'm leaving! Nacho, fucking do something! Get off me! Leave me alone! Make him drink, make him. Move. Wait! I'm sorry, Nacho. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry. You're gonna eat this one. Just kidding. Dude, I was kidding. I was fucking kidding! What's your problem, kid? Man, seeing you like that you'd think we're family. I'd go to the corner bar to wash my face before going home to mom. Here, take this. Jordi? Jordi. It's about time, isn't it? Are you OK? Of course I'm OK. Did you see what you look like? You reek of alcohol and tobacco. I just drank a little, that's all. OK, I was smoking too. You drinking and smoking? All the kids my age do it. But you didn't used to. I'm surprised. Don't turn this into a drama. Fine. But if you come home late again don't turn off your cell phone, got it? Got it. OK, now you go to sleep. You're exhausted. I can tell. Sometimes I'm not sure who's the mom and who's the son. You're a big help to me. Really. A huge one. Some joint, huh? And boozing it up. Like a real man, not a fucking wuss. Hey, kid. What? Talking to the gym teacher without my permission? No more playing basketball. Is that clear? Where are you going? He's going to cry! You're not so cool here, are you asshole? You're scared shitless. -Hold him! -Cut it out! Help! Help! I'll make sure I don't spill a drop. You bastard! I'm gonna tell! You tell and I'll kill you. What's going on there? Nacho, someone's coming. Jordi. Those animals went overboard with you. We hate each other so we fight. That's it. A guy thing. What an asshole. Maybe I imagine stuff and you're not covered in piss. But who knows, maybe you deserve what's happening to you. Say what you want, kid, but something's the matter. Nothing's the matter. It's just the way I am. Look, I'm a gold medalist in fuckovers. But up to you. What? You gotta die from something, right? So your mom's a nurse... And your dad? Your dad must do something, right? He died two months ago. And you,?what do you do? You have any kids? And a wife? Jordi, Jordi, Jordi... Let's go, Birria. Birria? Nice name, isn't it? Listen up, wuss, David and I wouldn't like you telling anyone about our jokes. Ah, another thing. Forget about basketball once and for all. It that clear? I said is that clear! Just in case it's not clear, and so you'll see I'm serious... Nacho, let's go. Come on, there's a lot of people. You know the game rules, right? What's wrong, kid? I stepped on her leg. I'm going to get it fixed. This time of day? Come on home. Come on, let's go. Weird fracture for just stepping on her. Anyway, she's out of danger. Go to vet tomorrow with your mommy. Don't say "mommy". It bugs you, right? Like you when I say my grandpa died from smoking. Bruno, what were you? OK, all done here. Is that your family there? Here, take your pet rat and get out. Come on. Jordi, you're looking more and more... I don't know, sad. -Me, sad? -Yes. What are you talking about? I'd feel bad if it was because of me. I know you worry, but you shouldn't. Because changing cities has been really good for me, you know? My work is very fulfilling. Plus I have you. What more could I want? Yeah, but you're depressed. Don't you worry. I'll have it under control soon. Let's see... She'll be running again in a couple days. Let's see... Yep. It looks fine. Keep it moving, we don't have all day. Easy, get in line. Keep it moving. Fuck, dude. You're bleeding. I just popped a pimple. Quiet down. OK. Let's begin. We brought you all together here to talk about a very important subject: harassment at school. With us we have a Ministry expert, who's a sociologist and psychiatrist, Mr. Pau Junceda. Hello, good morning. Harassment at school. Bullying. Abuse. Call it what you like, but it exists. It's an evil, a curse that not only makes many suffer but that for some it can even cost them their life. We all remember the tragic cases that have occurred lately and that appeared in the press. Personal dramas that begin as if it was all just a joke. Bullying. Sounds like "bullet", like violence, doesn't it? Well I'll show you some statistics now. It is obvious that it's society's responsibility, but it is also ours. Because... if you know of any case, if you have any suspicions, you must report it. Who can be bullied? Anyone. You, you, or you. There is no concrete profile. And the curious thing, the saddest thing, is the person bullied winds up believing that he or she is to blame for what's happening. The pain of others. That's what the bully feeds on. The pain of others. So much so... that if a victim shows no fear, the aggressor will leave him or her alone. And why does someone become a bully? Well simply to stand out in something. Yes. Bullying. Together all of us must eliminate it. Let's report it. Thank you. Look, you won't believe me but I swear all the little jokes are over. See ya. Yes, doctor, it's the same feeling of anxiety. Constantly. Anxiety, sadness... Yes, I finished the whole box. Fantastic, at 8:30. See you then. Bye. Thank you. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi, Nacho.?How are you? -Good. I came to see Jordi. Sure, come in He's inside. Jordi! What are you doing? Look who's here. What's up? Why are you hiding? -Something to drink? -No, I'm leaving soon. I came to abuse the master of math a little. OK. I'll leave you two alone. -See you later. -Feel right at home. -6-4-2. -6-4-2. I got you registered, wuss. Here's your first job. When it's finished, you e-mail it to me. Got it? I told you before. From now on, no more jokes. Don't you touch her. This dog has a bad temper. And a very good memory. Is your leg all better? Well careful you don't break all 4 of them. Leave the picture alone. Leave the picture alone. Leave the picture alone! Get off of me! Bye, wuss. OK, I'm leaving. See you soon, Julia. Bye, Nacho. Come over when you want. Jordi needs friends. Fine by me. I agreed to help him with his homework. PROTECTlNG YOURSELF AGAlNST BULLYlNG lS POSSlBLE I'm sixteen years old. Daughter of immigrants, but born here; I've been bullied for 1 year by my classmates. I know it might be my fault, but I'm scared and I really feel like dying. Do you like... dogs? Hello. Hi, what are you doing here? What's your name? Birria. -Then you must be... -Jordi. Hi, I'm Ania. I adore the sea. I've only seen it a few times. Even living this close? Well I wasn't so close before. But now, I look at it every day. I haven't felt so relaxed in a while. You don't even know me. I could be one of those... You're not one of them, I know. Listen, Ania. Those girls, the ones that bully you, what do they do? They call me "fucking spic", "rat hair", they say my skin smells bad, that we come here to steal their jobs, they hit me, they spit at me... Look. Cigarettes. They swear they'll kill me one day. But that would almost be a way out. Why don't you tell your parents? Or a teacher. Or the cops. Jordi! Come on, wake up! Let's go, get up! Coming, you're such a pain. You have one message from yesterday, at 1 1:30 PM. Jordi? What time do you go to bed, wuss? I'm pissed at you. The homework wasn't very well done. You didn't try hard and I don 't like that. We'll talk at school. You can't understand, you don't know what it's like to feel threatened. Your folks don't have problems, right? Mine are immigrants and do, and I don't want to be a burden. I mean, fuck, I can't understand it! I was born here just like them. So Ania, what do you want to do now? I'll never forget this afternoon. Never. Wasn't that Nacho? You're better today. It went well with the doctor. I feel better. I'm glad. Then change than gloomy face. Give me a kiss, I'm late. I won't be home for lunch. Bye. Where are you, wuss? I really miss you. You come back or I'll tell your mom. I see her around. What's up, kid? Your girlfriend leave you? -You haven't been to school in days. -None of your business. I could give a damn. But even so you're being an ass. And what about you, eh? I don't have a problem, you do. -You're pushing it, kid. -No, you're pushing it! Look like a pig, reek of booze, you make me puke. -Shut up. -You're sick. -Shut up! -Why don't you talk about your family? And about you. What did you do to wind up like this? -You make me sick! -Shut the fuck up. Shut up! Birria! Where are you? Jordi? Mom, you don't feel good? -What are you doing here? It's 12. -You sure you're OK? Of course. I came to get some papers. What are you doing home now? Can't you see? Playing hooky. Please. If you have something else to say, now's the time. Jordi. We're here to help you. Are you having problems with... a classmate or a teacher? I... I don't have problems with anyone, I told you. I'm more interested in other stuff than school. Like being in the street. -ln the street? -Yes. But it won't happen again. I swear. Look me in the eyes. Do you really mean it? By the way, why did you quit basketball? -The coach says you're good. -You're not playing? No, I'm bored with it. Hi. Feeling better? What a cute girl. And no more playing hooky or hassles. OK, OK. I already promised. I'm on call again, I'm sorry. Here. And don't lose it, they're very expensive. -Julia. -Hi, Nacho. How are you? Just fine. And you, how are you? -Were you sick? -No... I had a cold. You should've told me. I'd have brought you my notes. Goodbye. So where were you, wuss? Swear your mom and the teacher don't know anything. I swear. -What time's this to be coming home? -Same to you. Where were you? -Hi. -With some friends. And you? At the psychiatrist's. But I'm OK. Is that girl's perfume? Well, well! -What's up, kid? -Hi. Hey cutie. Looks like Freddy Krueger is mending his ways. I like it when you smile like that. With no hassles. Where are you going? Come on, let him by. Come here, wuss, come here. Look, since you're such a loyal buddy, from now on you'll be my protg. Nobody's gonna bother you. Cool,?isn't it? But in exchange you have to do all the work they give us in class. I get 1/2 your allowance. Some other stuff and that's it. OK? You're gonna do it. Got it? By the way, I'm fixing a little surprise you'll love. You'll see. Nacho. Come on, training time. The other day I promised you a surprise. Remember? Now you're gonna see it. -ls he gonna like it or not? -Depends on his tastes, right? -This is starting to piss me off. -Get off. You're a virgin, back and front, no? Where do we begin? I don't have all day. -Today's your big day, dude. -Are you nuts? -I'm out of here. -Then fuck off! What a jerk! You're screwed up. Where are you going? Chill, Jordi. Chill. If you don't want to fuck, she'll blow you. Who cares? Take this. Here. That's mine! Asshole! Son of a bitch! What are you doing? Come on, Nacho! Help! Help! -Leave him the fuck alone. -Don't fucking move. Nacho, you're gonna kill him. You prick! Clean yourself up. Hey, rat. What's up? How's it going, kid? Didn't think you knew how to smile. It was just a sneer. Don't get excited. -You know what we call you at home? -You talk about me at home? I'm honored. We call you Freddy Krueger. Not bad. I've been called a lot worse. But if you keep this up, we won't be able to call you that. You don't even have a cigarette in your mouth. I'm smoking less. Hey Bruno, you know what? The only thing I know about you is your name. Let me tell you something, kid. I'm looking for work, and that's really big news. Come on, let go. And that? -A mock fight with some friends. -Mock. Yeah. OK, I have to go. Birria, come on. Hello. Good morning. What is it? You need to know something important about your son. Two cracked ribs, bruises and minor contusions. Listen, Jordi, how did this happen? I already told my mom. Some kids tried to steal my jacket and we fought. They wound up taking it. You should have told your mom. I didn't want to worry her with dumb stuff. This is dumb stuff? Listen, Julia, he was attacked. I'll have to report it to the police. And of course we will too. Take the day off, alright? And don't worry. Thank you. I'm fed up, you hear me? You think I'm stupid or what? -You're lying to me. -I'm not lying. It's not my fault you take pills and you see weird stuff. Tell me, please. Are you unhappy here? We came here for me, I feel guilty. Just drop it. -We live here, it's going fine. -I have so little time for you... I think something's wrong but you don't want to worry me with it. That's not true. I'd feel better if you saw a professional, a psychologist. -A shrink? -Yes. Jordi. Jordi, please. He denies everything, but I think something serious is going on. Could it be that you worry too much? You said you lead a very stressful life, with tons of work. No, that's not it. I'm sure someone is making his life miserable. Do you have proof? No, I can't prove it. But too much has happened to him lately to be a coincidence. Since you're hinting at it, this is my reply: at this school bullying doesn't exist. Our protocols prevent cases of harassment without our knowledge. Listen to me. I just hope you do something. Immediately. Don't worry. We will. When you decide to, I hope it's not too late. All I can do is sound out the kids. And calm down. You calm me down with specific measures and less words. Good afternoon. What if she's right? Please! Can't you see she's just hysterical? -Are you Jordi? -Yes. Hi, I'm Ania's mother. I'll get her, OK? Ania! How are you, son? -Hi. -Hi. -Well, my mom and my dad. -Another kiss. -Nice to meet you. -Same to you. -We're going to the beach for a walk. -Have fun. But don't come home too late, OK? Ania. Wait a second. You should eat some fruit, you're both too skinny. Go on. See you later. It's weird; it's like I've known you all my life. Well l... I even forget about all the stuff at school. I wanted to tell you I envy you. But in a good way. For being so strong and all that. What's wrong? Ania, I can't keep lying to you. I... What? I'm just like you. They bully me at school too. You don't believe me, do you? Look. I'm talking about bullying, not the kind of jokes played in every school. Now that that's clear, the question is: Do you think any student in your class or the school is suffering from any bullying? -Yes, David. -No. Don't be afraid to talk, Bea. But think before you speak. You know what kind of damage hasty opinions can do. No. I don't have anything to say. This is a routine control I'm performing in every class. There's no need to worry. Keep an eye out and don't allow any kind of aggression, OK? Good day. Chill, Nacho. Jordi didn't say anything. What's up, Jordi. How's it going? Good. By the way, final exams are coming up and I want to pass, so you'll have to work real hard on my papers. And another thing, if somebody bothers you, you tell me, OK? I'm out of here, I have to go train. Basketball, of course. NEW MESSAGE The quality's shitty, but aren't they fucking great? If your mom keeps being a nuisance at school I'll upload them to internet so they all see what an ass you are. Jordi? What a day it's been. I'm dead tired. But what's all this? Come on, sit down and enjoy, it's about time. Sit. But why did you do all this? Well... I did it so you'll see I love you. And that I'm fine. You don't need to keep worrying about that problem because there is no problem. Jordi. Stop worrying about me, OK? I promise from now on there won't be any more scenes. -Do you believe me? -Of course I believe you. Everything will be fine from now on. Right? Yeah. That's good. Thanks. Great, just when I started to like your pet rat, she barks at me. You're lucky, I was going to give her to you. She pays more attention to you. I bet she barked 'cause she saw me with this. And 3 miserable cigarettes in my pocket. So I don't end up like your grandpa. -Plus I found a job. -Yeah? It sounds that impossible? I'm leaving in a couple weeks. Kid, I know everything. What do you know? Your school friends making your life hell. -The bruises on your back. -What? Jordi, I saw them. Believe me, I'm an expert in bullying. I know exactly what that means. Swear to me whatever you do, you won't tell anyone. Alright, I swear. Her name's Ania. Ania? It's pretty. So tell me, is this Ania in your class? No. I met her over the lnternet. And she's getting bullied too. Give me that. Fuck, give it back. I smoke two fucking cigarettes a day! OK, up to you. You want one? It's the last. Seriously now, listen to me. A victim has 2 weapons: decision and the look in his eyes. If you show a bully you're not afraid and want to be free, he's fucked. Listen to me you fucking fag. Get the fuck off me! Touch Jordi again and I'll stuff your balls up your ass. Got it? Got it. Got it? Shit! What are you doing? Now you really screwed up, fucking snitch. I'm gonna kill you. So get ready. One... two... three! If your fucking drunk buddy touches me again, I'll smash your head in. Come in, kid. Son of a bitch! You swore you wouldn't tell anyone. You swore it! You bastard. You bastard! You lied to me. Let me go! Let me go! Calm down, kid. Calm down. -Calm down. -You swore it. OK? Now let's sit down and have a little talk, OK? Go to hell, you son of a bitch! Unfortunately common harassment at school known as bullying has claimed a new victim. A young girl, daughter of immigrants who received a brutal beating from her classmates. This afternoon she was hospitalized here and according to the medical report she suffers... Hi, it's Jordi, Ania's friend... Jordi, did you know what was happening to Ania at school? You knew it? You explain these things, report them. If not, look what happens, son. We've managed to stabilize her. Thank God! But I warn you her condition is still serious. Can we see her, even if it's just a moment? Please. OK, come on. Hi. Doctor! Please go back to the waiting room. Jordi! Wake up, it's getting late. Jordi. No sign of him at school or in any hospital and the police say it's early to declare him missing. I think I might know where he is. Where the hell is that brat? Jordi! The latest victim of harassment, the sad phenomenon called bullying, the young 16-year-old immigrant who was brutally beaten yesterday by her classmates, is now in critical condition after suffering from... Please try to remember something; some clue. I told you everything, Mam. After Ania's last crisis, Jordi left the hospital. We haven't seen him since. I don't know anything else. I'm sorry. What I need are clues to find my son, you understand? Don't yell at me. You said your son was being bullied here with no proof at all. You blame me and I won't tolerate it. Tolerate it or not, Jordi has been bullied at your school. He confessed it to me in detail. I witnessed it myself. I've seen things. His dog's broken leg, the bruises on his back... He was terrified of coming to school. ?What? He even had a gun pointed at him. -Why didn't you say something before? -I tried to fix it my way. It was a mistake. All this is very serious. We'll hold an in-depth investigation to... You just need to find Jordi. Get those fucking kids in here now. The School Board will meet and we'll call your parents. It's time to explain, to confess all you know. And remember we have a witness. Delaying the inevitable will go against you. It's time to speak up. Jordi might be in danger. Yeah, we were giving Jordi shit. Well now you can fix the damage you've done. Any idea where he could be? Then that's all. We'll let you and your parents know what measures the school will take in this matter. Get out. Get out! To a certain extent, you're to blame for what's happening. And you? You're his mom. You live with him. How could you not realize? How? Come on, let's go. Hi. We're friends with Jordi and we're sure he'll show up soon. Thank you. Don't get obsessed by guilt. Believe me, we all have our share. Son of a bitch. Jordi! Stay away from me. Don't come any closer. What's up, kid? I know about Ania. But her, all the shit they did to you, it doesn't justify your being here. You wanted to know who I was? Well kid, I was a failure. But now, now the only thing I want is to help you. So snap out of it, because it's not your fault. The Nachos of the world, or people like I used to be, are to blame. Come on, Jordi, we have to go report them. Stop being a jerk and let's go. Will you be back someday? To declare. And to see how you're doing. I hope that... everything works out for you. That you find your son again soon. I'm sure. I owe it to Jordi. Here, keep this for me. Come here. Be strong, OK? Goodbye. Today's a tough day for everyone. The first day without Jordi. His death must be of some use to us. It's absurd and terrible to think it wasn't. I refuse to believe that together we can't change certain things. OK, boys and girls, Let's discuss oviparous animals. According to studies in the EU, suffer from bullying, the UK being the country with the highest index. In Spain, 1 out of every 4 is bullied, in other words, 25% of school age children. The most worrying thing is that bullying continues to grow and we aren't capable of stopping it.
