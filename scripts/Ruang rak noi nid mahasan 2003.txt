I wouldn't kill myself for the same reasons as other suicidal people. Money problems. Broken heart. Hopelessness. No, not me. Many books say death is relaxing. Did you know that? No need to follow the latest trends. No need to keep pace with the rest of the world. No more e-mail. No more telephone. It'll be like taking a nap... Before waking up refreshed and ready to begin your next life. That's what they say. "This is bliss" Surprise! Present. But don't open it, it's mine. Nice place... big... Not bad. Sorry I didn't warn you I was coming. I had a bit of an emergency. Got any ice? You don't have a TV? How can you live without a TV? You can't just read, you'll go crazy. I can buy you a TV, and DVD too. Ah, it's fucking hot! Is Bangkok traffic always this bad? Took me almost two hours to get here. Can't believe you don't have a TV. Suicide again? Hanging yourself this time? It's too hot! I need a shower. This heat could kill you. Why bother with suicide? "Out jogging. Don't answer the phone." "This is bliss" Kenji. Tea is getting cold. Thanks, I'm coming. Got to find a way to go back to Japan. If not Japan, maybe Brazil. Japan is better, fuck overseas. But here you have a brother. Yeah, the crazy one. He reads too much. You can't go back to Japan. Boss will kill you. But I've known him for a long time. He's just in a bad mood. A bad mood? You fucked his daughter! If you fucked my daughter, I'd cut your dick off and stuff it in your mouth! Really? You've seen too many yakuza movies. Kenji. Ready to go home? Yes. Oh... Kenji. Ah... This is the form for the public. This one is for staff. Sorry. Sorry... See you. Kenji. I'm making sushi at home tonight. Are you free? Uh... I'm allergic to fish. Sorry... See you. Nid? - Have you seen Nid? - She's somewhere here. Nid! Nid! - What? - Let's go home. I can't. Let's go home. My client's still here. - I have to talk to you. - About? The Last Lizard Are you Japanese? Are you from Japan? Japan... Japan... Japanese... speak? Stop fucking with the radio. Nid... stop. - Are you crazy? - Take your headphones off. What the fuck... Did you fuck Jon? Who told you that? Did you fuck him? Jon told me everything today. What? What did that dickhead tell you? He's a dickhead. He's shit! So why did you have to fuck a shit like that? You couldn't leave him alone because he's my shit, right? Jon's such a dickhead. Don't know why you care so much about him. I... know... Japanese. I... Japanese... Japanese... Oh... Getting off here? Listen, Jon started it, not me. That's not the point. The point is you're my sister. He's probably got his dick in some other bitch's fanny right now. Get out. Out! "The lizard wakes up "and finds he's the last lizard alive." "His family and friends are all gone." "Those he didn't like, "those who picked on him in school, are also gone." "The lizard is all alone." "He misses his family and friends." "Even his enemies." "It's better being with your enemies than being alone." "That's what he thought." "Staring at the sunset, he thinks: "What is the point in living "if I don't have anyone to talk to?" "But even that thought doesn't mean anything "when you're the last lizard." Nid! Your car is parked out front. You know my crazy brother. Make yourself at home. We have a lot to catch up on, mate. Ice, ice, ice! Is this a house or a library? Damn, no ashtray. Cool place. You moved here for girls? Or boys? Thanks. I'll wait till it's cold. Help! Don't shoot, please! Kenji, aren't you going home? Is this your bag? The police thought it was mine, as it was put in my car. Your bag. I come to give you. Kenji, are you coming? Ah... you go first. Thai National Anthem Sa-wat-dee Krap Sa-wat-dee Krap You can speak Thai? O-hayo Go-zai-masu Want some pizza? Not hungry, eh? Beer? I know. I saw the name card in your bag. "Japanese lesson" Thank you. No eat? What are you staring at? Are you washing dishes? Don't. Do you want to go home? I can drop you. I - drive - you - home. You sure? Don't burn my house down. Nothing. My sister's name... Nid. I am home... Who the fuck are you? What are you doing there? Get Noi on the phone... Noi! Noi! Hello? Hello? What are you doing? How dare you come in here? Get out. Get the fuck out! Why did you leave me alone, Nid? Hey, did you see a Japanese guy? What are you doing? I bought you some sushi. Fucking expensive. OK, I know you're sorry. You don't speak much Thai? Thank you. Good luck. I don't want. - Thank you. - I thought you didn't want any more. Too expensive. I'm full. Then stop eating. Never mind. No problem. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 5... 5. You are very pretty. Thank you. I'm studying Japanese. Really? I'm going to Japan. Where in Japan? Osaka. When? Soon... Monday. This Monday? Same work I do here. Really? Hello... Nothing... Just a friend. Friend, understand? No, don't come. I am going out. Why do I have to tell you everything? This is my life! If you want to talk shit, don't call any more. No go home? This house is very dirty. You want to stay, stay. Go to hell. 1,375 baht. Why am I cleaning the house when I'm leaving in a few days? I knew it... The bitch blew me off this morning. Now, go back down and blow. Watch your teeth! Two dead people inside. We should clean your house then. Did you fart? You fart? You fart? Not me! That hurts... Let's go home. Hey, Jap boy! Hey, Jap boy! Are you upstairs? Jap boy. Nid, I'm sorry. Thanks for cleaning the house. Thanks, for the house. You're welcome. Tomorrow we'll do the laundry. Bon Appetit. That brat did! Hey, come sit here. You saw my book, in the bag? What? Er... two days ago, my book... in my bag. What book? Children's book, about a lizard. Japanese cartoon... in my bag. Hey! You need woman? Here are my father's clothes. What do you want? You had Japanese for dinner last night? Are you fucking him right now? Fuck your mother! Come on, I miss you. I don't miss you. But what if I miss you? Go fuck yourself, then. Come on, don't be rude, darling. Go to hell, arsehole! Let's go together, then. I told you. Don't be rude! This'll teach you some manners. So, this is your new fuck? You'll be sorry... Fucking Jap! Bon Appetit. I'm not taking it to Japan. I give you licence, too. It doesn't look like you. Don't laugh... it's you now. You drive me to airport on Monday, OK? It's a good car... Amazing. You smell. Really? - You should take a bath. - OK, I will. Goodbye, Nid. This is papaya salad. Delicious? - I have present for you. - Present? Close your eyes... And turn around. Thank you. You're welcome. My first time airplane. You many times? Two, three times. When you go to Osaka again? I don't know. You want to see me again? Yes. When? One day. Kansai International Airport, Osaka - Just one bag, Sir? - Yeah. We're only going to kill someone, then come right back. Hope you're not hijacking the plane... Don't worry, we're not Arabs. Here are your boarding passes. Your gate number is 69. Have a pleasant flight, Sir. Er... Mr Tajima, you're very funny. Hey, young lady... You have some seaweed stuck in your teeth. Are you Kenji? Good day, Sir. Good day. What the fuck? Are you Kenji? Get me a beer, I'm thirsty. Excuse me. Freeze! Kenji? "This is bliss" Noi, someone's here to see you.
