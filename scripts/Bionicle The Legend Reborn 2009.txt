Sorry, little one. You may have noticed, I am not steady on my feet yet. I have the feeling you're trying to tell me something. Easy. I will not hurt you. Ah, it's the mask you're interested in. Magnificent! Which you can see for yourself. Before this day, I never needed help from anyone or anything. Thank you. Well, little one, I spared your life, you saved mine. Shall we call it even and go our separate ways? Okay, easy. It was just a... State your business. Just a traveler looking for the nearest city. Well, then, you may as well start digging. Here on Bara Magna, you're bound to find the ruins of one or another. That's a joke. Let me guess. Not a big laugher? Right. Well, to answer your question, nearest village is Vulcanus. I've got some business there, if you want a ride. That is, unless you'd rather wind up captured by a pack of bone hunters, or worse, Skrall. What are bone hunters and Skrall? No one you ever want to meet. Hey, you've got a... Relax! You've got a filthy Scarabax on your back! I was just trying to knock the disgusting thing off. Thanks. But I like him right where he is. All right. Whatever. I'm Metus. I'm Mata Nui. Hold on! What happened here? Who knows? Been like this long as anyone can remember. But if I had to make a guess I'd probably say it was... Evil. I was going to say "earthquake", maybe "volcanic eruption", but "evil" works. Not from around here, are you? No. I figured. It's clear you can fight if you can defeat a Vorox, and there aren't many Agori who can do that. Agori? Me! I'm an Agori. Although most aren't as good-looking as I am. That's another joke. Truth is, we're just peaceful villagers trying to survive. Not like the bone hunters, cutthroats who steal what little we've got left, when they're not fighting with the Skrall. Good! Sounds like we're just in time. For what? You'll see. Back in the day, the villages settled disputes the old-fashioned way, by destroying each other. Very messy. Lot of clean-up. So we came up with a solution. You Agori use your best warriors for sport? Not sport, problem solving. Much more honorable than slaughtering each other. And considerably more profitable. Not that I care about that kind of thing. Come on, Ackar! Take him down! Get him, Strakk! The red warrior, Ackar, used to be the greatest Glatorian in all Bara Magna. Metus. Good, you're here. Look at Ackar. I'm telling you, his days are numbered. I practically had to beg him to fight. Mata Nui, meet Raanu. He's the leader of this village. Mata Nui's new in town. Hmm. What do you think? He fights without fear. That is a rare quality. True enough. But he's lost his taste for battle. And once a Glatorian loses heart, it's not long before he meets defeat and must be banished. No doubt that is why Metus brought you here tonight. I don't understand. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Raanu. There's plenty of time to find a new First Glatorian to take Ackar's place. By the way, did I mention that I recruit Glatorians? This red warrior fights with the courage of a true Toa. He's done it! Get up, Strakk! Concede. Yield to me, and this goes no further. All right. You win. You leave with your honor intact, and I with your shield, in victory! Watch out! You call this honor? He was clearly defeated! We're just Agori. We're not going to fight a Glatorian. Did you see that? Interesting. No wonder he's so fond of that bug. You're finished, old... I'll cut you down for that, outsider! Too bad. I'd hoped he'd bring a decent price. Strakk, no! Your fight's with me! You're next, Ackar! He asked for it, now he's going to get it! How in... Concede! Fine. For all to hear! I concede! Who is that stranger? Whose village will he fight for? Don't. Your victory, your shield. You won honorably. The prize of victory is yours. Well, in that case... I've got plenty of shields. How quickly they forget. I am already an outcast. It's never too late to win them back. Perhaps. I am in your debt, stranger. You won all these? Yes. And look what good they do me. Should have packed it in long before this. But you stayed. Why? Duty. Pride. But a Glatorian past his prime is no good to anyone. To be defeated without a fight would be dishonor. You carry this truth inside you, as I do. You are a true Toa. Toa? Mata Nui! You were brilliant! Raanu will pay anything we ask. And if you don't like this village, no problem! I can get the other leaders to bid for you. That is very kind, but no. Are you crazy? Do you realize what you're passing up? The life of a First Glatorian! Oh, yes! Look how great it worked out for me. The answer is still no. Okay, okay, I hear you. But when you change your mind... I will not. Playing hard to get. I can respect that. Soon enough, you'll come around, begging for me to take you back. Okay, that's a joke. You'd never beg. I'm going now. So, stranger, what are your plans? I begin searching for a way back to my homeland. Which is? You will think it sounds crazy. Well, no crazier than jumping into the arena armed with only a tail and that thing. True. My home is far from this place, on another world entirely. I was once its protector, until I lost everything to a powerful evil that has enslaved my people. That is why I must find a way back. I knew it! What? Proof! Proof of what I've been saying for years. Kiina! This is not the place! But I was right! Who is this? Wait. No, she's... Name's Kiina, a Glatorian. One of the best. And you just won me a lot of bets. "Kiina's delusional! There's no such thing as other worlds!" Yeah? Well, he proves it! It's okay. Although I don't always agree with her methods, such as lurking in the shadows, as Glatorian go, Kiina ranks. I was right. I was right. I'd trust her with my life. I was right. I was... Good to meet you, Kiina. I have recently discovered what a great gift it is to find someone you can truly trust. So what they're saying is true? Let me guess. You call him Click? Hey! I was just kidding. I like it. "Click" it is. Wow. A real other-worlder. Finally! Someone to convince the Agori there's a place better than this miserable wasteland. He needs our help, Kiina. And I owe him. Help, huh? I might be able to do something for you. But I'm going to want something in return. I want out of this dump! You have to take me with you! Kiina! It's all right. If it's within my power, I will take you, but the time to help my people is running out. No problem. I work fast. What do you have in mind, Kiina? Well, I discovered an enormous cavern under my village. It's filled with weird, ancient equipment and tools. It might have something you can use. A word of warning, though, don't even think of pulling a fast one, 'cause you're my ticket out of here. Is the cavern in that canyon? No, it's near Tajun, my village, just beyond the canyon. The Glatorian are heading for Tajun. You know what to do. I don't like this. This canyon's ideal for an ambush. Please! Even bone hunters aren't dumb enough to take on three Glatorian. They're getting bolder. Skrall, too. In the past months they've seemed to know our every move. True. But don't worry, it's not like we've got much worth stealing. Well, maybe Mata Nui does. I meant his blade, bug face! I can't believe I'm talking to an insect. When an enemy knows too much, it can only mean one thing. A traitor. I was thinking the same thing. But who? I think we've got a bigger problem! Skopio! We should turn back! Can't! They're even deadlier! My village! There's another Glatorian there! Just got to make it through! Hang on! Tight! Help Kiina. I'll draw the beast away from you. Good luck. All right, Click, ready? Mata Nui! We're finished unless we can make it to my village. Try and get to the chariot. I have an idea. Going to be close! Where's... There! Gutsiest move I've ever seen. Yes! Those bone hunters are going to be eating Skopio belly for weeks. Not bad, other-worlder! Kiina! What... No! Is that... Tajun. It's Kiina's village. Well, looks like the Agori got away. The village! Our homes! This is my fault! I should have been here to help. Where's Tarix? And Gresh? We had a training session today. He's just a rookie. He wouldn't have been prepared for... There! Gresh! He's hurt! Easy, son. Easy. I'm fine. I'll be fine. Oh. Just shut up and let us help you. We need to get out of sight. Your cavern! Right. The entrance is this way. Skrall, bone hunters, working together. Impossible. They're rival tribes. No! Kiina, I watched them destroy your village. Gresh! He isn't... He's still alive. But not for long, if that savage sees us. Tuma? Leader of the Skrall? What the boy says is true. Bone hunters have joined forces with the Skrall. They won't find us in here. This way. Wait. These glyphs. I... Later. First we have to take care of Gresh. The cavern is just ahead. Look at this. Incredible. Each chamber contains elements that were once plentiful on the surface of Bara Magna. Lay him down over there. Show yourself! Now! Okay, okay, okay. Look, everything's okay. It's just me, Berix. You filthy little thief! I told you if I ever caught you down here again I'd... Oh, hey. This place doesn't belong to you. And, hey, look, I am not a thief. I am a collector. Ooh, I like that mask. Can I have it? I just wanna... Come here, you! You know, I have a right to collect anything I want. Oh, yeah? You know, it's just junk no one wants anyways. Then why do you want it? 'Cause I like fixing things. And I'm really good at it, too. I mean, come on, who do you think got the lights working, huh? I was wondering about that. Hey! You've got a... He knows! He knows! Ever fix an injured Glatorian? No way! He's not touching Gresh. The boy needs help, Kiina. Well, I've had to patch myself up a few times. Touchy. Yeah, like every time you've been pounded on for stealing! "Collecting"! Maybe you should let me work on your ears next, Kiina. He better pull through. You got that? Great. No pressure. What if he's the traitor? Then he'll pay. Something wrong? I don't know. There's a familiarity about this place. It must have been created by the old rulers of Bara Magna. Great Beings. The Great Beings were here? "Great Destroyers" is more like it. Why do you speak against the Great Beings? Because they wrecked our world, that's why. This was Bara Magna before the Great Beings left us here to rot. You have no proof of this, Kiina. They could've just as easily ended up buried in the ruins. No. The Great Beings did not fall here. That much I am sure of. What is beyond this? No idea. Never been able to get it open. Yeah, me neither. But I bet there's something good through there, huh? Keep dreaming! And pay attention to what you're doing, thief. I recognize this symbol. What is all this? It looks like this could have been some sort of laboratory. It cannot be! What's wrong? You look like you've just seen a ghost. I have. You know that thing? Yes. A gigantic mechanical being. Just like the one now enslaving my people. Wait! You think the Great Beings had something to do with it! No. The responsibility lies on my shoulders alone. This place, these symbols. We are on the right track. You have all the fun. I get the next two. You can have them. Let's move. We need to warn the villages about the Skrall and bone hunters uniting. And that we've got a traitor on the inside. How are you holding up? I'm fine, thanks to Berix. No problem. But I could use a new weapon. Skrall shredded my blade. Get in line. I might be able to... Don't even think about it. I am sorry about your weapons, but I must continue my journey. What? You're not going to help us? I have my own battles to fight. Trust me, Mata Nui, I've seen you fight. You're not ready. Stay, and I'll teach you everything I know. Wait. What you did with the Vorox tail, and Click. Could it work with these? I don't know. This mask gave me new life, but I still don't completely understand its power. I think it only works on things that are, or were, alive. No problem. Most Glatorian weapons are made of bone or claw. Collected a few, have you? So funny. It's worth a try. Together as one mind. It's working! What in the... Of course! Fire is your elemental power. The Mask of Life has simply ignited it. You have become a true Toa. Thank you, friend. Strange. I have worn many titles, been called a lot of things, but never "friend". Me next! Unfair! I score this clawed-out new blade, Mata Nui tells me I've got awesome Toa powers, but none of you will even let me test them out. You mean, like this? Oh, come on! Just a little test? Patience is the first lesson in becoming a great Glatorian. I think this is pretty great! Whoo! Whoa. Guess it's a standoff! Looks like I can blow you both away. Better yet, why not combine them? Enough! There's more to winning than fancy weapons. And let me tell you, Mata Nui here isn't the only one that could use a few tips. Yeah, he totally got... Ow! Ouch. Stop it, both of you. Pay attention, and you might actually learn something. Like this! Learn to read your opponent's next move before it happens. I'm warning you, I'll bite back. Study their fighting style, find their weakness, then use it against them, if you can. Where are we? Twin villages of Tesara, just over this dune. It's good to be home. Sounds like a Glatorian battle's about to start. Not if I can help it. Why so jumpy, thief? Rip someone off around here? Or just looking for a Skrall spy to tell our plan to? I am not a traitor, or a thief. But, you know, I have done a little collecting around here, so I'd best lay low and just... Hey! I do like that. Look at that. Pretty. Ow! Would you stop it? This is not the time, Berix. Mmm-hmm. I told you, Raanu, pitting Vastus against Tarix would pack them in. Hope this means you're ready to... What a surprise! Welcome, old friends! Isn't this great? A sold-out crowd! It's over! Over? What is he talking about, Metus? Ackar, with all due respect, you have no authority here. And you're too late. Vastus! Vastus! Vastus! Vastus! Vastus! Vastus! Tarix! Tarix! Tarix! Fighting between Glatorian must stop! Our real enemy is out there, massing as I speak! Wait! What are you doing? Mind your own business, you old fool! Yeah, sit down! Silence! Let him talk! I agree. Speak, Ackar. Thank you, Vastus. And you, Tarix. Listen to me, everyone! Bone hunters and Skrall have formed an alliance! It's true! They destroyed our village, Tarix. Impossible. Kiina speaks the truth! Tajun is gone, and it's just the beginning. We must unite, not fight each other! Time is running out! There's no way we can stand up to the bone hunters. The Skrall are too powerful! Calm yourselves! Your village leaders know what is best for you! We will do as we always have. Your old ways will not work. You are facing a united army now. They will not stop until your people are destroyed! This is crazy. Let's everyone just think! We have no weapons. How can we fight back? Enough! Yeah, we kind of thought that might get your attention. Toa Mata Nui has offered to help us build up our defenses. Why should we trust this stranger? Tarix, give Mata Nui your weapon. What are you going to do? Show you the power you already possess. I don't believe it. It's incredible. What more proof do you need? The time to unite the villages has come! No! Wait, wait! If we agree, do the Glatorians and Mata Nui swear to stay and protect us? You do not need to ask for the allegiance of the Glatorian. But we cannot speak for you. I will not pretend I have anything left to teach you, but I'll ask, as a friend. Help us. Then as a friend, I will stay. We fight together! We fight together! I have to admit, I was hoping I was wrong. Don't move, traitor! What? No! You've got it all wrong! I was following... He was following me. You? You? Huh? Berix! Hmm. Ackar! Mata Nui! The Skrall have kidnapped Kiina and Berix! What? How? I saw them being dragged away through the hot springs! We must go after them before they get too far. I'm going with you. My wound is healed. I'm ready! No! You can't leave us! This is just what the bone hunters want! They'll lead you away, then wipe us out like they did in Tajun Village. He's right! You have to stay. Yeah! I understand your fear. But we cannot turn our backs on our friends. Kiina is just one Glatorian, and the other is a worthless thief! Yeah! Yeah! No one is worth sacrificing, no matter how small. We stand by each other, as a team. So you'd leave us defenseless? I was once forced to abandon my own people. I will not do it again. The Glatorian will remain here. I will go, alone. No! You can't! No! No, you can't. We will see each other again. Let me go with him. He doesn't stand a chance alone. Oh, he's not alone. Thought I might find you up here. Thank you, Ackar, for everything. I should be thanking you. Here, this might help. My guess is they'll be here, at the Skrall camp. I wish I could go with you. I know, I know, you're ready. Question is, are they? Uniting these two villages is a strong start. Let's hope the rest of the villages survive long enough to join us. You've learned well, friend. I had a great teacher. The villages have been linked. Incredible. What is it? I will explain later. It was my cavern, and you should have stayed out of it. Oh, really? Your cavern? You stole it! You're a thief, just like me. That... No! And I thought you said you were a collector, you little weasel. Now she remembers! How things change when the metal claw is on the other foot. That doesn't even make sense! Look, that cavern was my secret place, my private sanctuary from all the ugliness outside. Can you even understand that? Yeah. Yeah, I can. You know, look, I've got feelings, too, you know. And by the way, I didn't steal them. No, you just collected them. Did you ever think, maybe you weren't the only one that needed to believe there was something more? I got an idea. Maybe we could share the cavern. It could be our secret place. I mean, once the Glatorians rescue us. 'Cause they are going to rescue us, aren't they? Look where we are, Berix. I wouldn't count on it. Yeah? Well, then what's that? Yes! So brave! Is he... Alone. I'd hoped all the Glatorian would come, but it seems they're even bigger cowards than I thought. Either he's a madman or he'd like to join the winning side. Which is it? I am here to fight for my friends' freedom. One on one. I don't believe it. Neither does Tuma. Unless the Skrall leader is the real coward? I'm going to enjoy tearing that fancy mask from your face. Dirty, cheating Skrall! Hey, no fair! All too easy. Come on! I can't watch. I can't watch! I can't watch! Mata Nui's getting shredded. No! Don't you see? He's doing what Ackar taught us. "Study your opponent, find his weakness. " Well, he'd better find it fast! Did this pathetic weakling really believe he could bring down the mighty Tuma? Be careful. Arrogance can topple giants. Trust me, I know. That's it! That's it! That's it! Mata Nui found a weak spot in Tuma's armor, and now he's using it against him! I get it! Would you stop? This cannot be! I am the Mighty Tuma! I... I... No! I claim Tuma's shield in victory! Release my friends! All right! I could always pick a winner. Now thrown down your shield and your weapon. That's not a joke. So you were the traitor all along. Save yourself, my friend. Cursed insect! You coward! Keeping tabs on the Glatorian so you could sell us out to the Skrall? Not a coward, just a good businessman. You were the one that convinced them to unite! Of course I did. You think they'd come up with that on their own? As rival tribes, the nomads did little damage, but together, under one ruler... You'd lead them against your own people? What have the Agori ever done for me? Ah, well, let's see. We trusted you? The Glatorians will tear you apart for this! She still doesn't understand. We are the only ones that know. Exactly. And by the time the Glatorians realize it, the battle will already be over. I win. Finish them! I've wasted enough time here. I have to get back. Unleash the wretched beasts! If that giant crushes them, so be it! Where are you going? Don't run, you idiots! Fight! Hey, Mata Nui! Up here! Mmm. Are you all right? I am now that I got this back. Thanks! What is that? I believe we are witnessing the true power of unity. And loyalty. Here, you may need this. Really? Wow. Nobody's ever given me anything before. Can I keep it? Only if you survive. Don't worry, just stay close to me. Hold up! Aren't we missing part of the team? Now we are ready. Hey! Wait for me! Well, you know what I mean. What? No! No, no, no! Oh, no! No! Look out! Okay. I'm all right. No! Oh. What the heck? No trial, no treasure! Oh, not good. They have us outnumbered More like 20! Yeah, but who's counting? Let it be 100. We have the true power. We fight with honor and purpose! So the coward flees. Hold them here! The traitor is mine. What are you waiting for? Destroy him! Out of my way, you filthy Vorox. No! Wait. We can make a deal. I'll give you whatever you want. I have what I want. You. Stop! What are you doing? No! Now everyone will see you for what you truly are. You may have defeated me, but you'll never defeat my united army. Of course. There's too many! They're still coming! We can win this, together. For unity! For unity! For unity! Now, as one! We did it! Thank you. And I used to think Scarabax were just annoying little pests. My apologies, Click. I will never doubt you again. I can't believe it's over. And that all of us are still in one piece. Wait! Where's Berix? Berix? Berix! Berix! I haven't seen the little guy since... I told him to stick close to me. Kiina. No! He was my responsibility! Berix! Berix! Down here! Little help! Help? Come on. Please? Mmm. You jerk! I thought... Don't ever do that again! You know, I think I liked it better when you hated me. You can let go now. Don't like parties? Agori from all over Bara Magna are pulling together, literally, uniting all the villages. And we have you to thank for that. No. I was only one piece. It took each of us to complete the whole. This celebration belongs to the Agori, and you, Ackar, the first leader of the new united villages. Look. They've done it. Whoa, you seeing what I'm seeing? Mata Nui, do you think that you and that giant might be connected somehow? Perhaps. But you are looking at an empty shell, the remains of what might have been a great ruler, the guardian of his people. Wait! I've got something. No, no, no, hold on. Okay. Where is it? I know I put it over here... Oh, here! Yeah! Okay. I collected it from the secret chamber a long time ago. Forgot all about it until I saw that thing down here. They match! Uh-huh. And wait till you see the other side. Hey! It's the same symbol! No. Not a symbol. A map! To where? That is what I must find out. Don't you mean "we" have to find out? Remember your promise. You are welcome to join me. But I have no idea how long it might take, or the dangers that await. Thanks to all of you, I am closer to becoming the warrior I must be if I am to reclaim my empire and free my people. This time, though, you won't need to face it alone. Yeah. Then, my friends, our quest begins.
