But this is really important. -So you're saying you're more important than this? -No? -Did you say something I didn't understand? So, so you're saying I'm stupid. - No, no, I'm not saying... -I'm just fucking with you man. I'm Sergei. -Mark. -Yeah. So those people outside in the orange suits... - They the Hazmat suits. -They're what? -As in hazardous materials. -It's probably just a precaution. I'm Sally from next door. -Shit! -They must have put up a signal jammer. Well, they wouldn't want anybody contradicting the official story, would they? -Who are they? -Don't know, man. -Now, Who'd you think? Our government or at least the unelected corporations who control it. There's been chat online for months. If you knew where to look... -So you knew about this, then -If he did, how come he's stuck in here with the rest of us? Ignore the man; he's full of it... -Look, if we all just sit tight, I'm sure everything will be fine. -What? -Keep calm and carry on, yeah, great plan, Sal. Stupid fucking... -Aidan... It's alright. -Here. -Thanks. - Anytime. -Look, Everyone's doors, windows... -Sealed shut. -I thought it was just us. - Until someone smashed our wall down. -It's called strength in numbers! You know, in case it kicks off. -I'm going to check the reception in your place. -Don't touch my fucking stuff! -Please remain calm. The situation is under control. -Look I do not know if you can hear this, but look, we...we have to leave. Can somebody just tell us what's going on! -Please remain calm. The situation is under control. -What? -Are you an artist? -No. Yes. it's debatable. -Did you sell much? -I don't think I sold any of them. - Well, it's not about the money. is it? -Isn't it? -You know... You've been so brave, You get to choose. -I want the rabbit. No, give me the lion. -Much more macho. -Sergei's offering bottled water. If you want some -No thank you. -Thanks. So, have you... have you lived here long? What? -You don't really notice your neighbors, do you? -Although you're someday you can't help but notice. -What? -Enid, stay calm! We're coming! She slipped my mind. - Of course she did. -Please remain calm. The situation is under control. A medical team will be with you shortly. -That part's new. It would be a lot easier to remain calm if someone told us what is going on. Why do we need a medical team? -Please remain calm. The situation is under control. A medical team will be with you shortly. -We've through. -Enid? Come on, I need some help here. -She's alive? We did what we could. Someone had a party? -Enid. Enid Enid. It's Mark from next door. if you can hear me just give me me a...just... Fuck! - Jesus! -How did I get here? I said there was something going on, but does he listen? Does he? Nah. He was too busy doing... Got any pills? - Huh? -I can't go anywhere without me pills, can I? Dressing table, second drawer down... And fetch me ciggies! -That's my brother for you! -He's very nice. -It suits him. He seems a little... - What? -He seems very quiet. That's right. Nothing wrong with him. -You need to see this. -That's the military. Why would they send in an army? -It's a field hospital. - We just don't know what they are doing. -Are they coming in? -What's that? -He looks sick. - All the boys look sick. -Do you know what I think it is? Terrorists. Something funny? - No. You've...you've clearly thought this through. -What are you trying to say? -Are you laughing at me? -He's not, are you? -I'm just saying... Why would terrorists target this shithole? -Thirty years I've been here; we're in a shithole, eh? House of the future, they say. These aren't my ciggies. -What are you doing? - What dies it look like? -Please remain calm. - The situation is under control. -There was a gas leak, which we are currently dealing with. -They always say something. -What did you... Well, we know what it is now. -Don't tell me you're actually buying that? -You got a better explanation? -He's right. It does not make sense. If the gas leak why would they keep us sealed inside? That doesn't... -Please remain calm. Stay in your homes. -Hey, kid... You know you they never actually went to the moon. -Do not listen to him Nicu. -Just us to be last. Just like the fuckin' cattle. -Yes! Go on, my son! -Stay inside and wait for further instructions. Failure to do so will carry serious consequences. -They can't do that. -Yeah, well, they did, didn't they? -Must have somebody on the roof. As if they knew this would happen. -Wouldn't have happened in my day. Now you got all sorts coming in. -What? So this happened because of immigration? -I'm just saying... -I know what you're just saying. -Just ignore her. -What about you? It was ages before you even said hello to me. What's the matter? People around here are not good enough for you? -We need to move! Take the fight to them! What happened down there was an act of war. -He's right. We can't just sit and wait for them. We got to get out. -Sorry. Am I the only one who noticed the sniper on the roof? -Why don't you shut the fuck up? -Enough. We have to work together. We have to use what we have. You're strong, You're a doctor. - A nurse.. But you are. -Enid has experience. -And you make things. - And... I'm an artist. You have tools. We need more than tools, we need chemicals... We need something that could... -What? -It's a stupid idea. That would never work. -What won't? -Forget it. -Please. We have to try. -It's medicinal. -Of course it is. - Hey! -There's my pens. You're a little klepto, aren't you? Could you pour that in for me? -That will do? -What is that? -Well I made use of it for years as a sculptor using household chemicals. to melt plastics into metal. -Like that piece of shit in your apartment? -Yes, like that piece of shit in my apartment. All right, everyone stand back. -On three. One... two... three... It definitely moved. A little. -Do you hear that? - They're right beneath us. -Of course they are. They weren't doing this one block at a time, were they? -Can you hear anything? -I'll tell you something, kid. It wasn't like this in the war. You'd hear the sirens, you'd know that it'd be it. But it didn't mean you acted like animals. -This is pointless. - Come on! One, two... OK! First thing we do is take care of the sniper. -And how do you plan on doing that? -I thought we'd use you as a human shield. -One of us can get out and get a message to some one. Who? - I do not know. The authorities? -Wake up Sal! Those are the authorities! No one's coming to rescue us! Where is he, what was his name? - Who. - The kid in a spacesuit? I've looked everywhere. -Nicu! Come out, sweetheart! -He'll show up. Nicu! Not interesting, bro! -You've already checked there. - Well, I'm checking again. I thought we were getting out. Wasn't that the plan? -Where is he? -If you could just keep calm... - Fuck it! We have a problem. I just want to know where my husband is and what's wrong with us. Come with us. - No! I'm not going anywhere with you! What are you doing? Give her a sedative. - I do not need a sedative! I just wanna know... -Don't bother. Stage three already. What? So we just leave her? -Formal orders. Leave her alone. move out Nicu! What the fuck, man? Nicu? Can you climb back up, man? Don't worry. You're not in any trouble. You're good. just come back out, you hear? Listen, buddy. Just grab a hold and I'm gonna pull you up. OK? You got it? One, two... Take him to the tent! Let him go! -Listen, do you want to find out what's happening or not? And until this morning you didn't give a shit about our neighbors either, so Don't lecture me on caring. Hey! -You got any left? -Stop! It's tear gas. - I know! -Why would they need that? - Exactly. -Now you need to tell us what's going on. Why do you need to wear this suit? What are you doing? - Leave her alone! -Please don't do this. Nicu.sign. We've got one -I'm alright! Why did you do that? - He sends out a message. -That we're a bunch of psychos? -That we won't be beaten. We will begin. Like in the war, yeah? All units situation is out of control! Repeat! The situation is out of control! -Let me speak to him! -What situation? Describe it to us. -Identify yourself. -I live here. -This is a restricted channel. whose radio are you using? -She's fine. Just tell us what's happening. -We're here to help. Pass me on to my college so I know she's safe. Do you read me? -I've got a better idea! Why don't you come get her? -I know the situation is confusing, but you have to understand... -Where are you going? -This is an all unit call, containment is... -Talk! I said talk! -Listen, Just listen to me.. Let me talk to her. Yeah. I'll try and reason with her. -What's your name? Come on... Just a name. I'm Mark. This is Enid. Nicu. -Hazel. - Hazel. -Whatever you think of us, we really are trying to help. -Like how you helped the kid out there? -He wasn't...we -We were just there to breach the perimeter. - Perimeter? So now we're in prison now? -If this is all for our safety, why do you need these? -Something is happening out there. Did you get out unarmed? What are you doing? No. Please. - So if I just open this... -No, please! Don't! -She's not wearing it to protect us from what's out there, she's wearing it to protect her from us! -What's wrong with us? -Hazel? We think the first case has started a month ago. -i knew it! -We hoped it was isolated, but it spread so fast! -But what caused it? - I don't know. I don't know. I really don't! -How come no one reported it? -We told them not to. - Why the secrecy? -Widespreasd panic would just make things worse. -Worse than this? -they told us to isolate infected areas. Run tests and not tell anyone except please... - Please remain calm? You can't keep a lid on this forever. When people get better, word's gonna get out and... -How many patients have recovered, Hazel? -There is a chance that none of you are infected. -And a chance we all are? -So.. This virus... What does it do? the rate of progression varies, but in most cases we've seen it... ...begins in the throat. it becomes difficult to breathe and to speak. The next stage is rapid macular degeneration. -That means we all go blind! -Finally...the vital organs shut down one by one. It can be very fast. but it's never painless. -Well, you have a vaccine, right? -We're not prepared. it was too quick, too widespread. -How widespread? Please my wife and kid are out there. -I don't know. That's all I know, I'm sorry... -Sergei, no! -What she can do is breathe the same air as us. What's that? Huh? I said she was holding out on us. -What's in the syringe? -A Vaccine. Well, a prototype. -Does it work? - I don't know. What do you know? If we make it through the next 24 hours without showing symptoms we might stand a chance. -That's reassuring!- Then we have to go! - That's right! But they can't treat all of us, can they? - But anyone else within that door be a carrier. A moment of contact, breathing the same air, that's all it takes. Your best chance for survival is to stay inside. I wasn't trained me for this. It's all been some war zone. -You are... -We've been through this already. -Maybe we could share it? -She said the dosage was too low. Just be wasting it. -OK. then the moment anyone feels sick, they have to let everyone know. -Then what? We quarantine them. And how is that gonna work? because we would have already breathed the same air... -Get off of me! -What? Are you going to fuck me? -Get off him! -Brother. -Under the canopy of palm trees and suddenly... Into a big blue lagoon and they knew it was a sign... Let's try Number 18, it is one of... -You're wasting your time. They have changed frequencies. -Come on. Your turn! Well, then suit yourself. Still counts as your turn. -There must something you can test us with. -That'll be fun. -At least we'd know. -They will know soon enough. -My colleague got a testing kit. The one you killed. -I did what what I had to do. -Of course you did. -There was no sign of hazmats. -Maybe they've gone. -What is it? -Why are they coming over to our side? - Because they know that she's here. -You can't let them in You mustn't. If you do we'll all be infected. -What? it's not MY fault. -Alright, so whose idea was it to take a hostage and let the whole fuckin' world know about it? You said take her.. I would have taken her...-I know you did that. -God. -Don't! - He's right! We have to keep them out. -Hello? -We need to speak to the Hazmat you got. Hello? Are you still there? - Yes, still here. -I want to see. They took my daughter. -I'm sorry. - You need to let us up now! If you do, we'll all be infected. -Why do you want to come in? -We need to find out where the other vaccines are. -No, we've asked her. She doesn't know anything. -She's lying. They know more than they're telling us. -Why not see the others, There's one of them left. -We did that one. -Well, what happened? -Things got out of hand. She's the only one left. You need to let us in now! -I'm sorry, I can not. - Please! You've got to help us! -I'm sorry. -Go ahead! Don't just threaten me. Do it! What are you doing? - It's hurting one. -You heard! Everything's infected out there! -I want to take her outside. -Maybe we should both. Please do not! - -I'll tell them you took the vaccines for yourselves! They'll tear this place apart! -What are we gonna do? -finally we're going to use this piece of shit. -I'd let you comb my hair, if you were my girl. -if I were your girl, I'd taunt myself. -There's no shame in being scared. We all are. I can get you checked out. There is a rendezvous point at the other side of this block. If we went now, we'd still make it. -I can't - We'll come back for her. We'll take more vaccines and come straight back, I promise. -Now, how do I know your mate's not on the roof? -Because you'll be with me. Would you stay here with that psycho and take our chances? -We definitely get back to Sally? -Definately. -Are you sure this one's better? It better be. -Seal it! -It's not working. That's all of it? Fuck! -Try to do that a bit louder. Maybe it's one will be able to. Open the door! We need the vaccines now! We don't want to hut anyone, we just want the vaccine. -Listen to him! She's out! We don't need to get it! -Get it back! -Sally? Sally? -Back up, back up. Move! Put it down! -Let me help her! I can help her! Come on! We need to keep her conscious. -Hazel. -Come on, come on. - Hazel! -I'm sorry, man. -What are you talking about? Why did you stop? - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, buddy. -Wait right here. -Where is Aiden? You do not need to do this. - What did you say to him when we was out there? -There he is! Get him! -They think he's one of them. He is. -I'm not one of them! -This was my first day... -How do you think it's going so far? -I'll check the hallway. -No, I'll go. -They're coming! We need to move! -In the bedroom! In the bedroom! Enid, Enid come to the bedroom with me. Get in. Take this with you, you'll need that. Nick! Nicu, come on! You jump in there, you follow Enid. I will follow you later. -Whats happening? -What are you doing? She ain't coming in with us. What was that? - It doesn't matter. Let's go! -Leave her! -For the last time... We're not leaving her! -No! -Why did he come back? -I think they're gone. What are you doing? - Keeping him safe. What? You've never worn? -Alright. You go nice and slow. You hear? Nice and slow. -Mark, let him go, son! What is that? - It's them! They're gassing us. Let's get back inside! -No, no, no! We go out. If we get to clean air we might stand a chance. Go! -Please, help me! -Let him go! -Hold it! -Sergey! Stop! -You've got to help me! Mark! Help me! -Help me, Mark! Mark! Help me, Mark! -We've got to get out! -I don't see any snipers. - Must have left before they gassed the place. -It wasn't like this during the war. Some trampled out with their own We were all scared. At least it was someone you could see. Are you gonna finish it? Ah, you have it. Nicu, you can wake up. Come on, Nick. Come on, man. we've got to go! Nicu! Enid, we got to go now. Come on. No, no, no! She's resting. Let her sleep for a little. She'll catch up with us later. Okay, now listen. We're going to play a little game. Ok. We're going to see how long you can to keep your eyes shut for. OK? Come on. OK. You can open them now taking it off. Did you hear that? -Stay where you are. anyone found outside without our authorization will be treated as an infection risk.- When we get out, we'll get something to eat. What do you think? Don't worry, son. I won't let him take you. Please, let him go. - No. It's not safe out there. They took her. - Took who? - My little girl! Put him right there. What. You'd take out a little boy.You sick .. I just want to get him out of here and give him a chance, please! I told you it's not safe. Nicu, run! - Leave him alone! -Nicu.. Take this. When you get a signal... Send a message to that number. They'll be sure to help you. I'll be right behind you. Go! Go. -Control? This is Alpha Unit. - Go ahead alpha. -We've expanded the contaminated zone. I'll be back after cleaning. -Understood, Alpha. -We found another one, about 10 or 11 We'll bring him in with the others. -Copy that. -How are you feeling? A bit groggy? You won't be needing this. Hey... You're going to be OK. You're safe now. The end.
