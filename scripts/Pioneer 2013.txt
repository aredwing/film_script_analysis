What's up with Leif? They won't take you out. They're yelling at each other. Bro? Pia wants a word with you. - Huh? - Petter? - Hi. - Hi. Put the cap back on. You're not registering on the EEG. Why don't you come in and put it on? Very nice. Change of plans. I need you to step into the other chamber. - Don't break his heart, sir. - No, no... you. I'm sorry, Mike, I have to take you out. What the fuck are you talking about? What did I do? I didn't do shit. Please just do as you're told for a change. Get into the other chamber or you're off the entire program. Leif? Leif? Why was he taken out? Close the hatch. We're cleaning out the American gas mix. I feel like shit. Continue pressurization. We're almost there. Four hundred and ninety-five. Is this normal? There's nothing normal about this. Four hundred and ninety-six. That politician's here with a cake. Who let that bird in here? - There's an albatross in here. - No, it's a seagull. It's an albatross. I've seen them in the Gulf of Mexico. The wings are different. What are they talking about? Goddamn it, they're hallucinating. - Jrgen? Can you see the bird? - What bird? Five hundred. My lungs are on fire. Let us handle the gas next time, okay? Congratulations from the directorate. You're the first Norwegians to be pressurized to 500 meters. A world record for simulated deep diving was recently set here. - Does it feel good? - Yeah, it does. - Look at him! - Martin. Dad's on TV. In very deep water, the air basically turns to poison inside the body, so a gas needed to be developed to help the divers breathe down in such depths. What's working with with the Americans like? It's uncle! Exciting. They've got a lot of experience with this. One of the diving teams is Norwegian. I think we're in control of the process. Norwegian authorities wish to pipe the petroleum ashore. But first the divers must prove they can work at such depths. Petter will go on a new test dive led by the US company Deep Sea Diving tomorrow. 320 meters below the surface, they'll join two pipe sections in a habitat. What will it be like to reach the ocean floor? It's what we've been training for. Why we've done this experiment. So we're looking forward to it. In the US, Ronald Reagan has... - Did you see Dad on TV? - No, just Uncle. - It wasn't exactly about you. - Sure it was! - He's the one they interviewed. - Yeah yeah. - Yeah, but it wasn't about you. - You're not mad at me? This next dive will be my last. - Because? - I'm gonna become a diving supervisor. - I'll make loads of money. - Been drinking paint? We make ten times what they do. We don't. They get to see their family twenty times as much as we do. Is this Maria's idea? Nope. You're gonna dive until you're sixty? Sure I will. You live on a boat. Got no family. I've got you. But no kids. All that will change. Then you'll see what I mean. Look ahead, Petter. Welcome aboard. I'm Ferris. Let's get below. Yeah. Give me a minute. Fellas, straight on through, I'll join you in a minute. Boss? From your wife. - And from Marianne. - What about me? Shut up. There's no doubt in my mind that this is the right group of men but we still have to prove it to the ministry. That's the sole point of this verification dive. Three hundred twenty meters, three man teams, twelve-hour shifts, you know the drill. Focus on the job right in front of you and we'll all end up making a lot of money together. Who goes out first? - The Norwegians. - Why? 'Cause I'm saving you for clean-up. First in the Norway Trench. English, mother fucker. He said you're an idiot. Team one, enter the bell. How're you feeling, boys? Feelin' good. - Never felt better. - Excellent. Pete, you're first, Jrgen will stay in the bell. Good luck, boys. You're the TV star, you know. All right, boys... Open gas supply, divers. - Gas open. - You got the balls for this? Diver one out of the bell. Diver one leaving the basket. Petter? Petter? Petter? Have you landed? That's one small step for a man... ...but a huge leap for an ordinary guy from the projects. Diver two near the basket. Do you have a visual? I have visual. Okay, you can enter the habitats. Diver one inside the habitat. Diver two inside the habitat. Start pressurization. Thirty, forty, forty-two, forty-six... - Closing the valve. - Now the other side. We're blowing out the water. There's water seeping in. Okay. - Is it a lot? - No, it's not much. We just need more pressure. We'll fix it. Ready? Increase pressure by five bars. Increasing pressure. - Shut the valve, Petter! - Turn it off! Knut? Petter? Report, damn it! Petter? We've lost contact! - I'm here. - Focus on finding Knut! - Can you see him? - I can't see! Knut! Knut! - He's here! - Is he conscious? Bro! Bro! Can you get him to the surface? His mask is smashed! It's smashed! Just take it off. - I'm removing his mask. - Check his pulse. Bro! Knut! Petter? Is he breathing? He's breathing! Tell us... Tell us what's going on! Don't move! We'll send Jrgen down to help you. He won't make it! I'm giving him my mask. I'm giving him my mask. Bro. Bro! I'm coming out now. You won't make it back to the bell! Draw in the umbilical. No! You'll never make it without a mask! You hear what I'm saying, Petter? No! Petter? Jrgen? Pull in Petter's umbilical. Copy that. Pulling them in. Where's Knut?! Flood the bell, dammit! Flooding the bell. I've got him! I've got him. - You've got him? - Got him! - Is he breathing? - Bro? He's not breathing! Petter! Give him CPR. Come on, bro! Hurry! Get us up! Close the hatch. - I got a seal! - Get us up! You're not going anywhere! Not anywhere, bro! Come on. I blacked out. What the hell happened? I don't know. I don't know! Get the hypo from the equipment lock, Jrgen. Yes. Push it hard and deep. As deep as it goes. Now, Petter! Nothing's happening. Bro. Come on, bro. Come on... That's enough. Petter... It's too late. What happened? I don't know. I'm so sorry. That's really tough. Steady, steady. Maria, we're ready to go. - Ferris... - Get me out of here, man. - As quick as you can. - You know I can't do that. Put me on the emergency table... I can't take that chance. I'm afraid you'll get decompression sickness. Sorry, you gotta stay in there two more weeks. Did you notice anything weird about the breathing gas? Or hear anything? I blacked out. There must have been a gas cut. I know. Petter? How are you feeling? Jrgen says there was a cut. This is your responsibility, Trond. - Careful now, Petter. - Petter... I never said that. You said you heard how I stopped breathing. Listen, Pete, you need some sleep. Do yourself a favor and take those pills. I wanna speak to Ferris. - Ferris isn't here. - Where is he? We had a cut, I had no gas. I was out of it before the explosion. Just try to relax, we'll figure it out as soon as... There's nothing to figure out! We know who controls the breathing gas. That's not true, I kept my eye on the breathing gas. Then what do you think happened? You inflated the plug until it blew up. Because I passed out! Explain that! - This conversation is over. - Explain it! Petter? My condolences. You want Knut's briefcase? Trond? Trond? Ferris? I'll talk to you later. Where is Trond? He's not on board. I sent him home. - Why? - This touches everybody. Trond as well. Look, Pete, we can have the best technology in the world, we can take every precaution in the world, but still... mistakes get made. Don't they? Listen to me, son, nothing's gonna bring your brother back. Speculating, pointing fingers, that's not gonna do anybody any good. Not Maria, not Martin, and certainly not the project. There's a hell of a lot at stake here, you understand me? I'll take care of the press. Jeger! Jeger! Hi. - My condolences. - What's the directorate gonna do? I don't understand, eh... About Trond Edvardsen. He screwed up the breathing gas. - If there's any ambiguity... - That cut should never have happened. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. I promise. Look here. Call me anytime. This isn't what I ask for. It's not what I want. No, I understand. So what are you gonna do about it? Mortal accidents are complex events. The supervisor disagrees. I know what he thinks. I made no mistakes. Well, let's see what the police have to say. Maria! Here. It needs new batteries. Unscrew the bottom. - I'll get by. - It wasn't my fault. It was an accident, okay? Hey! I wanna see the recording from the accident. The video tape. I'd love to show it to you. - But there isn't any. - "There isn't any"? Have you erased it? There wasn't any tape in the recorder. - You expect me to believe that? - Ask Leif, Ronald, Ferris. - I'll ask Jrgen. Where is he? - On sick leave. Sick leave? Why? - I guess he's ill. - Just let me see the tape. Shut the fuck up, you have nothing to do with this. Petter. You overinflated the plug. You can't change that. Hey! Jrgen! Hi. - Trond says you're sick. - I've been a bit off. You're not sick. You're working. I'm feeling better now. Has someone told you to keep your mouth shut? Jrgen! Answer me. Why won't Trond show me the tape? - What are you talking about? - What happened? I don't know what you're talking about. I had a cut! You heard it! Jrgen! Jrgen? Jrgen! Hey! Jrgen! Hey! - Something's wrong with Jrgen! - Another seizure? Hi. I need a word with Leif about Jrgen. - He gets seizures. - I know he's on... Did he get one in the bell while monitoring the gas? I don't know anything about that. - Are you back? - No. Leif? Hi. How long have you known Jrgen's sick? What's wrong with him? Health is a private matter. His dad says he's had several seizures. I need to do another EEG test on you. Because? Because it's my job. Has Jrgen taken another test? - Leif? - Yeah. Did you know Jrgen was sick when you sent him down on that dive? - It wasn't my call. - What do you mean? Ferris would like to talk to you. - Leif... - Now. Ronald, I'd like to see Jrgen's EEG test. Rats seem to stand pressure better than us. Okay, Jrgen's EEG test... See? Normal. I need a copy. Staff medical information is confidential. It belongs to Deep Sea Diving, they co-funded the project, so... Pete, please, if there was something wrong here, I would tell you. Honestly. Tests like these are... They're really open to interpretation. We also judge divers on their performance. It really comes down to how you feel. - So, how do you feel? - Fine. Hey Ronald? Ronald? Are you there? You can read stuff into the tests, like Leif did. - You can find anything. - It says that Jrgen's ill. They're normal. Only Leif sees the connection. What connection? Jrgen's sick. Yeah. But medically speaking, these charts don't say so. It's Leif's interpretation. You sent a sick diver down there. No one knew he was sick. Leif obviously knew. He wrote the conclusion in hindsight. This is a bad time for you to get fired. They're preparing a new test dive. - I won't dive now. - You have to. The Petroleum Directorate needs to keep one Norwegian diver in the program. - Thank you. - Thank you for meeting us. We need to talk. - Do you have an appointment? - No. - Talk to my secretary. - I've something to show you. The police are doing what they can to... Jrgen manned the bell at the time. He's sick. It says so here. - Isn't this confidential? - Just take a look. I can't interpret this. Can you? I think he caused my brother's death. He gets seizures. I've seen it. - Have you shown this to anyone? - No. Okay, I'll follow it up. But we need to conclude the verification dives. The mission isn't over yet. I won't dive until I know what happened to my brother. Right. I understand. - Hi! - Hi. - Uncle? - The police called. They did? Hi. It's like this: Jrgen Heimland has taken responsibility for the accident. He admits that he shut the wrong valve in the diving bell. He did what? Could you repeat that? He cut your breathing gas. - Okay. How's that? - Human error. But was it a seizure? The report doesn't mention any seizure. You don't know what happened? You can file a civil lawsuit if you want to. - No. - Why not? I couldn't bear it. - What does the report say? - It says what I just said. - Is Jrgen here? - Jrgen's gone to Spain. Tell him I wanna talk to him. You all right? What happened? You tried to kill me. That's what happened. Couldn't avoid you. You broke into me. You flipped that car on your own. - Who asked you to steal these? - What? These EEG tests. Was it Leif? Where's mine? I want mine. - Where the fuck is mine? - Why do you want it? 'Cause that shit could end my career. You know your friend, Leif? He's a fucking hack. He says I'm neurologically damaged. Petter? I need to talk to you. What are you doing here? Were you here earlier? What do you mean? We need to talk. Just look at the boat. What are you doing here? I'm gonna find out how Knut died. Okay. And you think I've got the answer? The gas Ronald's given you contains a secret component. And the goddamn Americans won't say what it is. I made him stop using it at the research center. But they call the shots at sea. So Knut promised to help us. With what? He was gonna take a sample of the American gas in the bell. - Didn't he tell you? - What are you saying? What sort of bullshit is this? Did you find a gas sample in Knut's briefcase? I'd know it if he was taking a sample. Ronald's drugging you with that gas. You wobbled around like a drunkard. That's why you passed out. - Jrgen's taken the blame. - He'd never turn off the gas. Listen to this. Listen to Knut's voice. He didn't pass out. What's that? The tape from the accident. Trond said there wasn't any tape. Trond? I took the tape. - Okay, you can turn it off now. - It's enough now, Petter. Petter, stop it! I'm stuck here! Petter? Knut has no problems with the gas. - You were on the same feed. - Shut the valve, Petter! Knut! Petter! - Report, God damn it! - Petter? We've lost contact! Find the gas sample, and I'll reveal who did this. Lift it up and get this part in there. That's it. Great! Martin? Remember the flashlight I gave you? Yeah. - You know where it is? - In a suitcase. - Your suitcase? - I think so. - Where is it? - In my room. What's that? It's a gas sample. Leif? Hello? Hello? ...it has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people... Leif? Leif? Leif? Leif? Leif? Leif? Leif? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Leif died as a result of a morphine overdose, according to the police. The medical examiner has yet to verify that. But, um... I know at least some of you are aware of the... courageous efforts that Leif made to battle his addiction. In fact, he was supposed to be in rehab this week. Unfortunately he never checked himself in. For obvious reasons, the family would prefer that the manner of his death not become a matter of public knowledge. I found Knut's gas cylinder. It's up to each one of us to help protect the colleague's reputation. Let's observe a moment of silence in memory of our friend. Leif Lindberg. You want me to test it? Hm? You want me to test it for you? It's empty. I have to know what's in that goddamn gas. If I go on the next dive, bring back a gas sample, will you test it when I get back? No, after everything you've been through, you need a break. Besides, you're not prepared. These boys have been training. - Of course I'm prepared... - That's my final decision. Maria, do you have a... To the right. There are no Norwegian divers left. That's why you have to go. The Americans refuse to let me dive. Who's stopping you? The diving physician. Ronald. - What's he saying? - That I'm not prepared. That I'm not fit. I don't know. The pipeline will come ashore there. The Americans think they've won the contract. That they can just open the tap and help themselves. You'll make a good supervisor. That's not what I want. I wanna dive. I'm talking about your future opportunities. When we start pumping the oil. Of course you'll dive. It's not up to the physician to decide. Are you ready? I'm going back to work. I'll be back in three weeks. That's exactly what Knut said. Let me show you something. You can turn it off now. - Petter! Turn it off! - Shut the valve, Petter! You hear me?! Shut it off! What the hell is wrong with you? Hm? I have to find out what happened. I have to understand, get it? - I don't need to know. - But I do! That's why I have to go down there. I'm sorry about your friend, Leif. We all get what's coming to us. Petter? For you. Hey, missy. You're a scientist. Inspect this. You recently lost your brother on a similar dive. How does that affect your work? I think he'd have wanted me to go on diving. I don't really think it's affected my work. Excuse me? Dr. Lindberg called me. Leif? The day before he died. Wanted to talk about the accident. - Anything else we should know? - No, not that I can remember. Do me a favor and call me if you remember anything. Be careful about what you say to the press. - What? - You heard me. The gas sample you're taking in the bell. Give it to Pia as soon as you're back. - What are you talking about? - Don't try to get smart. Hey, Pete, think you're ready for this? What? - You ready for this? - Yeah. You don't think so? Slow... perfect. Petter is going first, Mike. Fuck you he's going first. My fucking record, sir. This is not about your record, Mike. We're here to prove that we can build the pipeline. - It's all right. - No, it's not. He can take Phil with him and I can tend the bell. Please just do as you're told, guys. This is bullshit. Open gas supply, divers. Gas open. Come on, Pete, pull yourself together. Begin to pressurize. - Trond? - Yeah? I don't feel too good. I'll switch places with Philip, and man the bell. Phillip, you'll have to do the welding. I knew you weren't ready. Okay, guys... ...give me an update on the welding. Guys? Still there? Mike? Okay. How long do you have left? Should be done in an hour. Okay. You ready for your photo, pin-up girl? That's why you're here, right? To celebrate all the work we've done for you? Is that Niagra Falls or are you just happy to see me? - Hi. - Hi. I couldn't get the sample. Why not? I didn't have time. No room for it. - Welcome back. How've you been? - All right. How did Jeger know about the sample? Who do you think I work for? To build the pipeline ourselves, we need the American gas recipe. Were you going to give me the results? Yes, of course. - Mike? Mike? - Yeah, man? You know where Ronald is? I don't know. Downstairs or something? Petter... Petter! If you have the sample, give it to me now. You risk your life if you keep it. You risk your life if you keep it. I don't have it. You leaving? I've proved what they hired me to do. I got a sample of your breathing mix. - Where? - Tell me what's in it first. I can get someone to test it for me. And I will go public with it. It's a secret, it's how I make my living. By drugging us? Let me show you something, Pete. At the depths at which you boys need to work, the nervous system is affected by the pressure. You need an anesthetic to work down there. - Anesthetic? - Drug. Call it whatever you like. You need something to overcome the effects of that pressure sickness. Have a look. I want to explain to you why you need an anesthetic. Without it, you'd collapse. We're just past 500 meters. The big glass has no anesthetics. Which would you rather be? I collapsed on your drugs and my brother died because of it. You blacked out, but not because of my gas. I know what happened, I saw the tape, Leif showed it to me. Think about it, Pete, no one else fainted, only you. Jrgen was fine and so was your brother until you passed out - and caused the explosion. - Jrgen's a mess. Yes, both you and Jrgen are clearly affected but not Mike. And Mike's been on my gas more than anyone. What does that tell you? Why did you take him out of the pressure chamber then? Because I didn't want to expose him to Leif's misguided experiments. And it turned out to be the right goddamn decision. Your blackouts were caused here. By Leif. He took away my gas, the one thing that could sustain you. No one can handle a gas change like that at 500 meters. You begin hallucinating, remember the albatross? That's when you and Jrgen began having blackouts. So you're saying what? That my brain is damaged? Because of Leif? Why didn't you tell me? You sent me down there and you knew. You knew...! I tried to stop you from going down. It was hard to stop you, Pete, you... You wouldn't listen to me. Hey, Pete. Can you hear me? What? You've got something of mine and I want it back. What do you mean? You know what I mean. The gas sample will be given to Yurig if something happens to me. Hey, son, this is not a negotiation. Pete, you're gonna sit there until you tell me where it is. Where is it? Take him down again. Stop! Stop! Talk to me, son. - I'll show it to you. - No. You won't show me, you're gonna tell me where it is, we're gonna go get it, and then I'm gonna let you out of here. Where is it, son? Damn it! Down! It really doesn't have to be this hard, son. What do you think you're doing? If you want to kill him, you'll have to do it yourself, sir. You need him alive, don't you? He's a stubborn son of a bitch. - Come and get me when he's out. - Pete. Pete, can you hear me? I'm bringing you back up. - What about the decompression? - We'll deal with that later. If you bounce him back this fast, he might not be around later. - Does he have a pulse? - Faint. Check his breathing, I'm gonna go get Ronald. We can't bounce him right up. He's got ten minutes until he gets decompression sickness. Hey! Hey! Don't move. Don't move! It's me, Petter. It's me. Petter, give me five minutes. You can't trust anyone. Leif... What did you get to lie? I didn't do it for the money, but to help you. To help me? How does it help me if you lie and take the blame for something you didn't do? We thought it was your fault. I'm not gonna listen to this crap. Just hear me out. They're all in on it. Does it look like I've got time to listen to you? I just came from 100 meters in the chamber. I'm going into the water - to treat myself for decompression sickness. That guy from the Petroleum Directorate, Jeger told me exactly what to say. He got me a plane ticket to Spain, just to get rid of me. Don't trust him. Hey. Petter? Ferris tried to kill me. They tried to kill me. Hey, hey. Shh. Shh. - Hi. - Hi. Coffee? No thanks. Ferris gave me this. He wanted to avoid a police investigation. Why did you accept it? You wouldn't take my money. - It's not your responsibility. - Of course it is. Would you rather take money from a guy who's willing to kill me? Is that better? How was I supposed to know? You must have realized something? I've realized it's time to look ahead. Can I take it? Why? - Hi. - Hi. - They found a dead body. - Yeah. It was Jrgen. I've got the gas sample. - What are you doing with it? - I'll give it to you. - That's the deal, right? - Yeah. As soon as Ferris leaves the country. How am I gonna make that happen? I'm sure you and Jeger can sort it out. Petter? The allegations would be laughable were it not for the potential damage they'd do to my company's reputation. They're just not true. However, Deep Sea Diving did feel a moral obligation to make an offer of compensation to his widow. There were no preconditions, I repeat no preconditions to this offer of imbursement. This is not a business practice we want in this country. Trying to bribe relatives like that is completely unacceptable. Can you lay the pipeline without the Americans? I'm confident we have the necessary know-how to do the job ourselves. - What are you looking for? - I just don't trust you. Relax. We need you. I've been named CEO of a new, state-owned company. We have to build the pipeline ourselves. I need someone who's been down there. You need the sample. The "necessary know-how", as you call it. Yeah. We need you as well. I want a job as diving supervisor. - Okay. - And I want the money. The cylinder's in the locker room. My brother's locker. Tell Maria we're grateful. She expects more than gratitude. "More than gratitude"? Her husband, your brother, dived down to 320 meters. He died there. He knew it was dangerous, but he did it... voluntarily. It was his job. The locker room. Knut Jensen's locker. In twenty years, when his son grows up... He'll grow up in one of the world's richest countries. THE NORWEGIAN PARLIAMEN APPROVED THE DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR THE PIPELINE ON JUNE 10TH, 1981. THE CONSTRUCTION WAS CARRIED OU BY THE STATE-OWNED COMPANY STATPIPE. CHOOSING TO PIPE THE PETROLEUM RESOURSES TO THE MAINLAND MADE NORWAY THE WORLD'S WEALTHIEST COUNTRY.
