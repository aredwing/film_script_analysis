His name is eight. "Z "O "Z "O "Z "O." Oh, my... Is your name Zo? Oh... It's so freaky. - Oh, my gosh. What? "No. " Uh... Okay. Uh... Is your name ZoZo? ZoZo. ZoZo. ZoZo the clown. That is so creepy. Monica, what are you doing? Hey! Monica? What are you doing? Oh, my God! Monica! Monica, calm down. What are you doing? Dear Mr. Evans... My name is Tess Carpenter. I desperately need your help. Something has happened to me. I innocently played the Ouija boad with some friends. Everything was going fin. Until, we came acrs an entity... That called himself... ZoZo. I'm sorry for your losses. Is that it over there? When you feel ready... I would like to hear your whole story. I cannot... get rid of him. He's with me... all the time. Constantly. He wants me to play his games. He owns me. I was normal. I was once... normal. - Hello? Tess? Hey, Aiden. Can you hold on a sec? Hey, so what should I bring? And who all's joining us? Well, as you know, today is Halloween. So... Bring a little of that fr to the island. Um, grab a costume, whatever you have. Along with us two, magician Nick will be the and Dean and his fairly new girlfriend Mel, the Wiccan. A Wiccan? Very fitting. I'm looking forward to it all. And your dad is really cool with us using his island get away? Yeah, shocking isn't it? It's great. It's been too long. See you soon, Tess. See you soon. Wow, is that really Tess? Hey guys. Hey, Tess, come here. - Hi. - Oh, it's been too long. Aw! - Man, I missed that smile. - Oh wow, uh... - BonjourAiden. - What gave it away? - The hat. - Yeah, I know. Hey leave a little for the rest of us. - Mmm. Hi. - It's good to see you again. Ah, likewise, Nick. - Hey, Dean. - Hi, Tess. - How are you? Come here. - Aww! So good to see ya. You look great. Oh, Tess, this is my girlfriend, Mel. - Hi, it's very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you as well. - And I want a hug, too. - Okay... Okay I give up, Tess. What are you supposed to be? Oh... Um... I am an... overworked college student. Let's get you into something a little bit more interesting. Okay. Well, you guys, it looks like we're all here. So, uh... Who's exactly going to take us over to paradise island? Wow... I know. Good morning, Skip. - Aiden, how are you doing? - Doing good. - Good. - Um, everybody ready to go? Yeah. - Yeah we're all good. - All right. Let's go, Tess. Nice bike. Thank you. Oh, my gosh... I love it. Do you guys need any help? Are you good? -No. Ladies first. Come on, Tess. - How many do we got here? - Okay. All right. Oh wow, look at the water. - It's so... Don't go over. You guys know I can't swim, right? - You can't swim? Yeah. You going to jump in after me if I fall in? Definitely. - I'm a lifeguard, so I could. - Seriously, though... You're a lifeguard? - No, really I am. - That's legit. Everyone, welcome to my humble home. You got it, Nick? - Yep. So... Oh, you want to help me carry these to the kitchen? - Yeah. Okay. Hey, you can put that in the All right, cool. That a boy, Nick. Guys, make yourselves at home. Oh, look at this view. Hey, yo, Nicky boy, heads up. Oh, good catch. Wow. - Hey, yo, Nick, there's a pool table up here. - Oh, sweet. Better watch out, Dean, I'm a shark. Maybe, not so much. How do you like the view, Nick? That's beautiful. All right everyone, quick announcement. Just so you all know we have two bathrooms in this house, but only one shower. Also, there's no locks on the doors so... If you see a door closed knock don't just walk in. Um, Nick, Dean, we're going to need to go get some fire wood it's going to be a cold weekend. No problem, man. Hey your dad's place is amazing, man. - Spend a lot of time here growing up? - Not really. Why not, man? I know I would have. Camping but, that's about it. So not too many times then, huh? Nah. I guess I was kind of a bitter kid. - You're still are a bitter kid. Get out of my house. Oh, you really went all out for Halloween. We Wiccans prefer to call this time of year, Samhain. - Samhain? - Yeah, it's like our New Year. Don't worry I'm not going to cast any spells on you. Thank you. This is my favorite time of year. I brought so many fun goodies, but first we have to prepare them. - Do you want to help with the pumpkin? - Sure. What are you most afraid of? Huh? - What's one of your greatest fears? Um... I hope this isn't like creeping you out right now. I just really like to get to know people through their fears. Okay. Uh, well, to be honest... I am deathly afraid of closed spaces. Ah, so you're claustrophobic. Yeah, I guess you could say that. I... I am terrified of elevators. - How embarrassing. - No, no, don't be embarrassed. I'm terrified of the dark. So, if we were trapped in an elevator and suddenly the lights went out, we would be done for. Exactly! Okay. Doctor, Mr. Pumpkin-head's brains are ready for extraction. Just reach in and grab handfuls of brains. Put them in the bowl and go like this. Squeeze all the seeds away from the guts, okay? Okay. I've never actually had toasted pumpkin seeds before. So... Really? Yeah. They are so yummy. But first it is important to know that we can't do any physical labor without a bit of this. It's a bit early. - Who's going to know? So tell me a little more about... - Samhain? - Samhain. Well, it's like a... Are you okay? Mel? Samhain is a, uh, Wiccan ritual - dating back to way before Christianization. -Mmm-hmm. I know what you might be thinking when I say "Wiccan". You're thinking witch and witches are evil. Oh, no, trust me, I have a very open mind. If you split up the year into two and label one half as light and the other half as dark Samhain is the end of the light half of the year and the beginning of the dark half. It's uh... Also a time to honor the ones who have passed. Crossed over to the other side. Let me put those beers away for you. Oh, thank you. Oh, gross. Okay, that is nasty. Ew, Tess, don't put your arm in there. I don't think that it's even on. Ugh. Um, Aiden, come over here and check this out. That's weird. Hey, has anyone tried turning on the lights yet? No, not yet. Shit. Power outage? Yeah, either that or a fuse blew. We're still supposed to have power this time of year. Just a second. Hey, Nick, um, hey, could you try flicking that light on for me? Sure. Nada. The oven seems to be working just fine. That's 'cause it's gas. Hmm... Trapped on an island on Halloween weekend and now no lights? What could possibly happen next? Well, next we prepare for a weekend in the dark. Hey, Tess, could you help me get some flashlights? And Nick, Dean, we're going to need more firewood. Watch your step. And here's your room, mademoiselle. Just leave this here for ya and... -Thanks. - I'll just be around getting some flashlights. - Okay. Hey, Tess, you want to see a magic trick? Yeah. Aiden, could you get me a piece of paper and a pencil? Yeah, I'll be right back. Okay. - Pick a card, any card. - Okay. - I'll take this one. - Okay. Now take a look at it. Memorize it. Great now put it back in the deck. Anywhere you like. - Okay. - Okay... Now... Here you go. - Ah, perfect. Thank you. All right. Now... I think, I've seen this one. No, you haven't. I need to write it down. - Write down your card on that piece of paper. - Okay. And then just crumple it up. - Crumple it? - Crumple it. There you go. Thank you. All right. Hey, don't burn my house down. And now, ladies and gents, let the river of magic flow. Nick! All right, now I need you to check through your deck because your card is missing. Where'd it go? The trick isn't over yet. All right, now I need you to take my hand. - Okay. - The other hand. - The hand that you wrote with. - Okay. All right, now I need you to imagine the card going from your mind to your arm and into my arm. - Can you do that? - Okay. - Got it? - Yeah. All right, we'll see. Now... - Was that your card? Dude, you're one seriously freaky... That was my card. Thank you. Thank you. Please, please, no standing ovations. - Nick, how did you... - Very, very spooky. Well, it's about to get even spookier. This, my friends, will be the icing on the cake for such an evening. I have been dying to know, what is in here. Well, wonder no more. This is an original oracle board, or talking board, or Ouija or whatever you want to call it. My mom always told me that these things were dangerous. No, the boards themselves are not dangerous. But some people may misuse them, like the way they communicate through them. Tess, you have nothing to worry about. They don't even work. How do you know? Nick, have you played? Well, scratch that, they do work, but its mysteries don't lie in the realm of the paranormal. It's more of a psychological phenomenon. Well, different strokes for different folks. Come on, Tess, it'll be fun. Wait, what do you mean "psychological phenomenon"? Well, as the obvious would suggest, you can see I'm a budding magician. I'm very interested in mastering the psychological aspect of magic. It's a pivotal tool to have in order to pull off a great trick. Nick, you're sucking the magic out of Halloween. No, I still think that this is fun, but just in a different way. I'm still curious about the psychological component, though. Well, not to drag this on all night, but big brains such as Faraday, Chevreul, James, and my favorite, and most modern, Ray Hyman. Have conducted studies of a phenomenon known as ideomotor action. In regard to the movement of the little triangle thing around the board or whatever one would use to play the game, scientific studies have been conducted and concluded that ordinary, smart people like ourselves can participate in muscular activity that is... That is consistent with their expectations. So basically your ghost is nothing more than unconscious muscle movement guided by your expectations. Wow, how boring. Dude, seriously, it's more fun to think that there's actually a ghost in there guiding my hands around. But I heard so many horror stories about these things. Ah, but do not underestimate the power of the mind. For some that idea is even scarier. Here let's focus. Tess, you in? Sure, but I'm going to be more of a passive observer. Great, but you can't be too passive. I need you to record every letter that the planchette moves onto. Aiden, can we have pen and paper, please? Thank you. Okay, first we have to protect ourselves from any negative energy. All right, let's begin. Please protect us from anything that has either negative energy towards us or this house. May we stay safe within the white light for we only want to attract pure energies with good intentions. Amen. - A toast. Happy Halloween and to the end of the harvest. Cheers. Are there any sprits here with us tonight? Is there anyone who would like to talk with us tonight? - Boo! - Dammit, Dean! Get off me. I'm sorry. Sorry. Okay. Are you done? Okay. Are there any spirits who would like to talk with us tonight? Dean, you have to clear your mind. Everybody, please clear your mind and focus on the question. My mind is being cleared. Okay. Is there anyone here who would like to talk with us tonight? Um, I'm not sure if that's a yes or not. Looks like a yes to me. What is your name? "D-E-D... " "D." It spelled out D-E-D-I-D. Dedid? Dedid it is. Dedid? What is your last name? "W "A "H "F "U "V." Um... "Wahfuv?" Is that an English last name? No. What kind of last name is Wahfuv? "C "H "E "C "L "K." "Checlk?" Are you from the Czech Republic? How did you come up with Czech Republic out of "Checlk?" It sounds more like a piece of gum. - Yes, he is. - Ooh. Are you from Prague? It looks like no, but it never quite got there. Maybe candy land. Are you from somewhere else in the Czech Republic? Did you move to America? - "Goodbye. " - Ah! You scared the poor little Czech guy away. Well, it wasn't a terrible start. Seriously, Dean. You moving it? No, I wasn't. Or, just a thought, maybe you were unconsciously pushing it around board. Let's try again. Yeah, and this time can we get a spirit that could actually spell? I'll try my best. Blind-folds on, come on. Hey. - Are you freaking kidding me? - I didn't do it. Okay, come on let's just play with our eyes closed. Is there anyone here who would like to talk with us tonight. Yes. This one feels better already. What is your name? Wow, it's legible. Um, his name is Adam. Really? My cousin's name was Adam. Adam, how old are you? "24." Adam, when did you die? It just said "one. " Did you die one year ago? It went to yes. Mel, is that your cousin? I don't know, um... My cousin Adam died last year when he was 24. Adam, are you my cousin Adam? Adam, are you my cousin? - Adam, are you there? - Mel. - Adam? - Hey, Mel, I think it's a coincidence. Adam, are you still with us? Hey, Mel, I think he's gone. Are you okay, Mel? - Yeah, it's just... I know it was him. Okay, um, sorry guys. Okay, let's just, um, talk to someone else. Adam is gone for now. So let's just move on. Is there anyone here who would like to talk with us tonight? "Yes. " What is your name? His name is Oliver. Oliver, how old are you? Aww, he's only eight. Oh, we got a little boy. - Hi, Oliver. - No, no. - No, no, don't get any ghosts stuck in my dad's house. - You're fine. Now that would be pretty funny. - Yeah, maybe for you. Oliver, how did you die? "Choke. " How did you choke? "Game. " Hmm. What kind of game? Just went to "choke" again. What the hell's the choke game? The Choking Game. I think he means self-asphyxiation. You know where you breathe in and out 10 or so times and then you choke yourself into euphoria. Mmm. I'm familiar with this game. - You would. - What? - Ugh. Oliver, what year did you die? Oliver, when did you die? Maybe he was murdered. Oliver, what are you doing right now? He's hiding. Are you playing a different game? Then what are you doing? "Danger coming. " - Is that what it said? Yeah. Oliver, what do you mean "danger coming"? - Hmm. What? "Go safe. " With an F. Go to safety? Or he meant "save. " As in save yourselves. Holy shit. Is there somebody at the door? Aiden, somebody's knocking at your door. All right there's no one knocking at the door. Aiden, your dad have a gun in this house? Are you kidding me? My dad's a liberal. - Is the door locked? - Yes, just... Shh... There's no one knocking at the door. It was just more of an isolated bang. What? Aiden, you are the man of the house. Go check out this isolated bang theory of yours. I'll be behind you. Yeah. Don't open the door. - Shh... Yes. I guess that was a... There's nothing out there. It's just a... Cool, Aiden, shut the damn door. That game almost gave me a heart attack, man. What were you going to do with that thing, Nick? I was going to beat it to death. We don't know what that was. It could still be out there. It was probably just a tree. A tree? A tree makes an isolated bang on the door? What the hell is an isolated bang? Let's play some beer pong? - Beer pong, yes. Sounds good. - Beer pong. No. I need to know what they meant about danger coming. Aw, my fault. - Party foul on Dean, dude. Come on, guys. Really? Dude. - No. Oh, no, Tess. No. - Quarters? - Quarters? - No. Dean, come on. It will be fun. Just a little bit longer. All right. Oliver, are you still there? Are you still with us? You see. I told you. It's the guy who killed Oliver and now his coming for us. Dean it is not the guy who killed Oliver. And he is certainly not going to waste his precious spirit time to come out of the board and kill you. And for the last time, put your hands back on the planchette and shut you face hole. Damn, look at the possessed girl. My face hole is going to get a cold beer. Fine. Shut your face hole? Shut up, Nick. - Shut your face hole? - I've never heard that before. Nick. Seriously, just calm down. Relax, okay. Okay. Tess, will you please fill Dean's spot? Sure. Nick, Aiden, will one of you please transcribe? Something interesting is going on here. Trade me spots. If you're not Oliver, then who are you? Wow. What? It just said... Well, not perfectly... But it just said, "Fuck you, bitch. " I've got to see this. Did the board just call me a bitch? Yup, it sure did. My kind of spirit. Really, Dean? Did you just call me a bitch? Well, now you're a slut. Did you just call me a slut? "Yes. " - Thanks, Aiden, I can see that. Okay. Hostile little prick. I'm not afraid of this asshole. I'm not afraid of you. Who are you? You getting all this? - Yeah, every letter. "I will come to you in the dark when you are most scared. " Mel's afraid of the dark. Shut up, Dean. - Seriously. You know what guys, let's just put this thing away. No. - Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. No. Um, let's keep having fun. Besides, I've never seen this thing work so well. Would you mind asking it a few questions? What... What do I ask? Whatever your heart desires. Um... Hello? Are you... Are you still with us? "Yes. " Did you kill Oliver? Tess. "No. " Well, that's a relief. Did you hurt him? Tess, Oliver's... Oliver's dead. Dean. Um, who... Who are you? "I "am "your "guardian. " My guardian? What do you mean, "my guardian"? "I "will "take "you "to "paradise. " Why... Why do you want to take me to paradise? "You "are "mine. " What is your name? "Messy Tessy. " Messy Tessy? That's what... That's what my mom use to call me when I was a little girl. How in the hell would it know that? Damn. What is your name? What... What is your real name? I don't know. I've never seen this before. It's just counting down from ten. Who are you? "I "am "Z-O-Z-O-Z-O-Z-O." Is your name Zo? "No. " Is your name ZoZo? "Yes. " Sounds Greek. "I "am "ZoZo. "I am ZoZo. "I am ZoZo. " What do you want? "ZoZo "wants "to "kill you. " Over my dead body, asshole. "Yes. " Oh, yeah, when you going to kill us? Dean, don't ask those kind of questions. "12." Well, if he means 12 midnight, he's late. It's after 12. Or he could mean tomorrow at midnight or noon tomorrow... Nick, we get it. - Mel, why is it moving? - I don't know. "ZoZo "wants "to" "sleep "with - "Messy Tessy. " Ugh. Is just me or is this third person shit getting anyone else? Hey, you guys, I really don't want to play anymore. I have one question. Nick. Nick, I really don't want to play this thing anymore. Tess, I just have one more question and I promise it will be a good one. Remember this is just your subconscious mind. Okay, ZoZo, if you say that you are real, then prove it. Do something to show us that you are real. "Pick... a... card. " For real? You asked for it, bro. Pick a card any card. Don't show any of us and then put it back in your deck. Okay. Now what? Tess. - ZoZo... What's next? "Magic. " Are you going to do a magic trick? "Yes. " When will you do the magic trick? ZoZo? What's next? Well, see if the card's in the deck. All right fine, but I think this is bordering on ridiculous. Hold on. - It's not here. Bullshit. You're not playing another trick on us? Yeah. My card was the Ace of Spades you find it genius. That's the same card that I choose. Ask... Ask where Nick's card went. ZoZo, where is Nick's card? "ZoZo... has... it" ZoZo, where are you? "The bathroom. " You're in the bathroom in this house? "Yes. " Aiden, you go check it out. I'm behind you. Yeah. There's nothing in there, guys. Then what happened to my card? Seriously, Nick, enough with your stupid tricks. Enough of what tricks? The card really vanished. What about the other bathroom? Here we are. Same drill? Yeah. - Holy Shit! Hey, what did you see? Somebody there, there's somebody there! What did you see? What did you see? It's dark! What was it, man? It was... I don't know. He's totally freaked. This is crazy. Let me get in here. Nick. No, don't. Please don't, dude. I'm going to get to the bottom of this, okay? I'm sick of this. I'm going to figure out what's going on here. Take this. It's going to be okay. All right? It's going to be okay. Here is your ZoZo. Bravo. But, Nick, where's your card? Let's get back up stairs and say good-bye to the board. It's not good to leave it open. There that should do it. This will be a memorable session. Nick, your card is gone and it's not coming back. It's got to be around here somewhere. I'll find it. Well, here's to one freaky night. What? Nothing let's go to bed, come on. Well, boys and girls, I'm being called to arms. Come on. Cheers. Nice. Bed does sound good right about now. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Nick. Well, now, that was an interesting night, huh? It was. It was also very unsettling. Oh, I think our imagination just got the best of us. - Nick was right about that part. - Yeah. It's just that it... Well it's hard to explain, but... It left me with this strange feeling. This feeling carries a lot of weight. Don't worry, Tess. By tomorrow morning, you'll be a 100 percent. - Will I? - Absolutely. May I? Yes, you may. Night. Night. Tess, are you sure it just wasn't like a bad dream or something? I mean... I've had some crazy realistic dreams. They can feel so freaking real sometimes. This seemed so real. It was real. It reminded of something that happened to my mom, at the time she was pregt with my sister. This really freaked me out when she told me this. Um, but one night she was lying in bed and all of a sudden something grabbed her ankles, and dragged her off of the foot of the bed. She struggled to stay on and she even called for my dad who was lying right next to her. - He never woke up. - Really? He would just think that she had bad dreams, but... But he could never explain, why in the morning he found her on the floor at the foot of the bed. Still with the sheets wrapped tightly in her hands. Wow. The very next night, minutes after getting into bed, um... She was overcome by a strong force. That left her completely paralyzed. - Wow. - Um... Kind of like what happened to me last night. She felt like something was holding her down. And minutes later, she was floating above her body. She started to, um, to crawl along the ceiling, to the door, into the hallway and eventually into the living room. She said that that's where she witnessed the most horrible sight in the world. There was a fire, everywhere. But she said the most disturbing part... ...was that there was a baby crying. A baby? She woke up in the worst state of terror. And she was clutching her stomach to see if the baby was still there. That's creepy shit. You know it's kind of weird. I mean... Tess, I haven't really known you that long, but... I pictured you as an only child. Um, I am. My sister died from complications just three days after being born. I have a secret to tell you. Last night when you were having your nightmare/dream thing, I stayed up and played the Ouija board. What? Why? I don't know, um... I had this overwhelming urge to play it. I got in contact with my cousin again. What do you mean? Adam. My cousin Adam? He contacted me through the board. It was him. It was him. I knew it. It was so nice to talk with him. Oh, Mel. - That's amazing. - Yeah. Now, that I think about it, the really weird thing was... He was asking me a lot about you. Me? Mel, he doesn't even know me. Why would he be asking about me? I don't know. He said... He was saying stuff like he thought you were really pretty. And he was sad that he wasn't still alive, because... Because if I think he were still alive he would wanted to go on a date with you. Mel, he doesn't even know what I look like. Why would he be asking about me? You were sitting right across from me when he contacted us the first time, Tess. Look at you. You're beautiful. In the likeness of a true Goddess. Lucky me. Let's go bury apple seeds and celebrate this day. - Come on. - Bury apple seeds? Yeah, let's go. Come on, Tess. - Come on. Come on. Come on! Okay! - Where do you want to bury them? - Because it's fun! Celebrate. Let's go. Oh, my God, be careful. Don't slide. Tess, let's go! Let's celebrate! How's your bitch, Nick? One beautiful bitch. Oh, my gosh. She's going in the oven. - You jerk. - Put her in. Oh, my God. Oh, why, thank you. - Let's see that baby. Oh, yeah, dude. Oh, whoa, Nick, no, no, no... - Okay. Hold it. - That is so gross, Nick. This is, this is fantastic. That's yummy. Oh, kiss it. What? Oh, yeah, kiss it. - Kiss it, Mel! Oh, yummy! - Your turn, Tess. - No! No, I'm okay. - Why'd you do that? - Who's hungry? - You guys are adorable. - I'm hungry! - Go ahead. - Oh, my gosh. - Let's do this. - Let's do this. - All right. - Are you going to bake it? No. No, no... Over an open fire? - Ooh! - Yeah. - So cool. - Yeah. - Nice. - Hunters, build me a fire. All right! - So primal. Are you... No. Ugh, it's crunching! Oh, my God! Ugh. Come on, Tess, let's go. Oh, yeah, Aiden, we're going to go build the fire. Tess! Tess! Hey, Tess. I, uh, need your help. You don't look too happy. You want to get me some brown sugar? And, yeah. Okay. Sorry. I can handle that. Where is our brown sugar in this house? It should be over there somewhere. Okay. Ah, its heart. Ah, brown sugar. Let's take the head off. How are you doing this, Aiden? Ah, been a fisher for a long time. Wow, hats off to Aiden because this is delicious. Aiden, if I was a vegetarian, I could literally live on this yumness, man. It's unbelievable. I have to agree with that, you know, Aiden, - I need to know the recipe. - Mmm-mmm. Sorry, Nick. Family secret. Come on! Help me out here, I'm a single guy. This could impress the best. It does. How'd you learn how to cook so well? It's kind of rare these days. Uh, two years of culinary school. But how, I thought you guys were all the same age. Not me. I'm a couple years older than the rest of the guys. Mmm. But, then how did you guys all meet? I actually met Aiden first. Yeah, he at the time was, uh, volunteer ambulance guy... And there was a time when I wasn't sleeping too good. Well to make a long story short, sleeping pills and liquor are not the best mix. Aiden here, basically saved my life. He did save my life. I never knew that. To say the least, it was a long time ago, and... It's kind of embarrassing. Oh, what about Tess and Nick? Mmm. Freshman year. Music appreciation. Aw, cute. And here I am. And here we are. - Cheers to that. Cheers. All right, well, guys, really quick. I would like to introduce you to another one of my family secrets. This, my friends, was maliciously stolen just one hour ago from my father's secret stash. My great-grandfather's pure grain alcohol, a. k. a. The Fourth Horseman. All right. The Fourth Horseman. Very fitting. Oh, just wait. Oh, wow. Don't be cheap on me now. You don't need a lot of this. Thanks, brother. So this Fourth Horseman. Is it like moonshine? Moonshine is like Kool-Aid compared to this. - That's what I'm talking about. - Yeah. - Oh, I think I'm going to pass on this one, guys. - Oh no. - Oh, come on, Tess! - This is an experience. Okay. It looks as innocent as water. Innocent on the outside, wicked on the inside. Flight attendants, please be seated for take-off. Oh, and a toast, to our dreams, our happiness, and, most importantly, our friendships. Oh, and after this weekend, we'll all be seeing more of each other. Cheers to that, man. Cheers! Here goes. Your grandfather wasn't messing around, man! - No! - This is ridiculous. No he wasn't. Hey, it's your turn. No, don't take it! Come on, Nick. Do it! - Don't. - Hit that! - Go! - No. Nick, you don't. Don't, Nick. Now do it, Nick. Do it! Oh! Good boy, Nicky! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Mel. Mel. Mel. Hey, Tess. What happened? You drank yourself to dream land. I only had a little bit. But that was all you needed. Apparently. Where is everyone? Alcoholic Dean is passed out under the pool table. And Nick and Aiden went with the bottle to find the answers to life. Wow, I must have been really out. What are you doing? Come sit with me. No. Haven't you had enough of this thing yet? I've been talking with Adam all night. Come sit with me. Adam? No. No, Mel, I'm not in the mood to play. Tess, we've been chatting up a storm. Watch. Mel, please. Adam, Tess is here with us. Tell her what you were telling me. Tell her our secret. Adam, we can trust her. Tell her our the secret. What are Aiden and Nick doing out so late? Tell her our secret. I need to get some water. Hey, Tess. Yeah. Could you do me a favor? Sure. Could you get me my inhaler from the bathroom, please? Okay, Mel. There's a bunch in my purse. You can't miss it. Mel? Mel? Mel. Mel. Mel. Mel. Mel. Mel, I have your inhaler. Mel. Mel. Mel! Mel! Mel, Mel, Mel, stop it! Mel! Mel! Mel! Come on! Oh, my God, Mel! Mel! Now look, I have your inhaler. Just use it. Take it. Mel! No! Hold on, Mel! Mel, just breathe! Hold on! Mel, just hold on! Oh, no. No. No! No! Aiden! Dean! Nick! Somebody help! No! Someone! Dean! Aiden! Someone! Mel. I'm sorry, Mel. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No! No! That was the beginning of my hell. And the end... of my existence. Mr. Evans? Am I crazy? No, you're not crazy. Who is he? Who is ZoZo? What is ZoZo? ZoZo is a force that has chosen to reside inside you. He selects certain people through the use of Ouija boards. Like a bird of prey, it comes to those who play the game. You have to let it go. But what about the board? - No one can find it... I'm here. I'm going to take the board with me. Are you going to get rid of it? Yes. Promise? I promise. I know it's not easy, Tess. I know what you're feeling inside. Let it go. Release it. Let it go. Let it go. Torment.
