A whole building has been closed off as a preventative measure due to an unknown virus  more than twenty people are trapped inside the building. Other than the residents inside, there are police officers and fire fighters and among them, two T.V. reporters that are accompanying them . It has not been clarified as to what type of virus it is. Neither the authorities nor specialists have yet been able  according to the last contact with the inside, there may be only one survivor. It appears to be the T.V. reporter who entered the building with the firemen in order to cordon off a secure area of several blocks around the building. We can confirm that the situation is now under military control. Were in. Roger, proceed. Lets go. Guzman, Lucas, third floor. Cover me. In here. All set . Second floor, devices planted . Going up, third floor. Lucas. Lucas. Shit! Lucas. What the fuck were you doing? Done. Devices planted. Roger! Lets go. Whats that? Shit, shit, shit. Proceeding to activate detonation. You have four minutes to evacuate. Go, go, go! Come on, lets go. Lets get out of here. Are you okay? Can you breathe? Lets get out of here. Now! Shit! I dont have a shot! Shoot! Shoot! Shit! Youre a doctor, you can help me. Evacuate. Three minutes remaining. The rules. Do it. Do it. Do it! Come on, we have to get out of here. Help me! Im up here! Its her. We cant leave her here. No, no, dont even think about it. Theres no time! Get out of here! Ill handle it. Youre crazy. Fuck! Okay, okay, its okay. You have to trust me, okay? One minute until detonation. Look at me. Look at me! Were going to get out of here. APOCALYPSE Hello, ngela. Its okay, theyre to stop you from hurting yourself. Thats it. Do you remember anything about what happened? No. Stay still. No. No. Its all right. Where am I? We just want to make sure youre okay. Let her rest. Pardon me. Could you tell me where the wedding is? I think I must have drunk too much. My daughter-in-law sent me for a lie-down, and I think Ive overslept. Sorry, but I dont know what youre talking about. I dont know where I am. It must be my head. Okay, neither do I know where we are. Then were in a bit of a fix. Have you seen anyone else around here? Okay, how about this? Ill go and try to find out where we are. You stay here. Stay calm and wait. Someone will come and get you soon. Okay, but if you see my daughter-in-law, tell her Im here. Dont let them forget me. Yes, yes, Ill tell her. How is she? Shes awake. She seems calm. Were wasting our time. This is the third test and all have come out negative. The girls fine. There are no signs . She was exposed for over six hours in there. We have to make sure. They really hurt. Okay. Ill loosen them a bit. Stop! Weve got a problem in the infirmary. The girls gotten out. Get her. Use your weapons if necessary. How much longer? Its processing, two minutes. Ive got her, shes heading upstairs. Hold it! Come on! Shes heading for the dining room corridor. Stop! Dont move! Run. Go, go, go! Go, go. Stop! You! Out of the way! Weve got her. I said move! Cant you hear me? Help me! I said move! After them! Hold it! Shit. Come on, come on! Lets go, move it! Stop! Hands up! Dont move! Stay there! Dont move! Weve got her. Awaiting orders. What is this? Where the hell are we? Lower your weapons. We have the test results. Shes clean. Who are you? Take her to her cabin. You should get some rest. No! Its okay, no more restraints, I promise. I asked you who you were. Please accept my apologies. Im Dr Ricarte, the medical protocol . I want to speak to my superiors. Your superiors sent you here, Im afraid. And my partner? I assume youre referring to Corporal Lucas. We had to carry out some extra tests. Just routine. Youll be able to see him soon. Why? What the hell are we doing here? This wasnt part of the operation. Its the only way to ensure total isolation and you know it. Isolation from what? Were clean, arent we? Youve obviously already checked. The situation is more complicated than you think. There was another outbreak close to Barcelona. Luckily, we have it under control, but we cant make any more mistakes. Dont tell me, a wedding. Only one survivor, but I see youve already met. Well! New passengers. How wonderful! And now if youll excuse me, Im sure Captain Ortega would be delighted to show you his boat. Captain. I imagine you boarded with that group at the last minute? So it would seem. Im Guzman. Come, Ill show you around. So youre in charge here? Dont be fooled. The ones in charge are the ones with the money. And those doctors are paying me enough to retire on. Forty years at sea are a lot. So after this, Im going home. So the doctors are in control. And just so we dont forget, theyve brought their own little army. I believe youve already had the pleasure. How are we doing? 28 knots. North-easterly wind coming in stronger. In a few hours well be entering a low pressure area. Very good. Reduce speed to a minimum, with any luck itll pass us by. Sure. Were not in any rush. Gorostiaga is our bridge officer. From Bilbao. A good man! Pilot, its easier. And call me Goro. That bruise doesnt look good. This? Tell the imperial soldiers out there, this is their work. Have you put something on it? No. I think you should put some antiseptic on there. Listen to the man, hes a doctor. Specialises in viruses and things like that. Here we go again. Im afraid this boats too old to throw such a party. No. Not too old. The problem is that theyre overloading the generator with all that medical equipment theyve got in the hold. What happened? Power cuts. Its been happening since we set sail. Its worse at night. Sometimes it goes down for a long time. Theyre setting up some kind of lab down there. What medical equipment? Like I said, its none of our business. Pardon me. I dont mean to trouble you. But, have we met? No. With so many people I get confused. Are you on my grandsons side or the brides? Did you have a bit too much to drink? Dont worry dear, me too! Nic. Nic! What are you doing? Nothing. Nic is the radio operator, despite his appearance. Yeah, though theres not much for me to do. Those assholes coded the frequency as soon as they got here, so . Youre saying were cut ofF? So much so that we dont even have lifeboats. I guess they hadnt told you that. Theyre inoperative. They blocked the offloading mechanism before we set sail. Those were their conditions. Yeah, what was it? Security security protocol. Pure bullshit. How are you getting on with the camera? Im working on it, but its going to take time. The camera still works, but the hard drives pretty busted, so Im going to have to do it frame by frame. A pain in the ass! Nic is also our I.T. man. The doctors asked him to recover the recording from the camera. They seem very interested in it. I found it next to the girl. God knows whats on it. No way . So youre the guy who saved ngela Vidal? Something like that. You dont know how happy youve made him! Im such a huge fan of that chick. When Im on land, I never miss her show. And when youre not, she comes to visit, isnt that nice? Lets see. So if you saved her, you must know her pretty well, right? Well, more or less. I mean, maybe you could introduce me? Sure. Of course. Check this out. Weve got a Filipino D.J. They come cheap apparently! The chef. Thats the dinner bell, youll get used to it. Depths of the sea, how can I help? Hows it going down there? Worse and worse. I dont even know where to start. Youd better tell them to keep calm up there. Calm is not an option, I assure you! Come up and get some dinner. You can carry on later. Okay, whatever you say. Here. Its all there is! I dont usually eat much dinner. A glass of warm milk is more than enough. Right. Hey, you! Could you bring this lady a glass of milk? Milk? And some cookies, if you have any. While youre there, see if theres anything else to eat. Some meat, or sauce even. This isnt an all-inclusive cruise! Dont forget it. Take it easy. Where the hell were you? And you? Yeah. Have you spoken to my daughter-in-law? No. I know its one of those modern weddings, but this is too much. Milk and cookies. Wonderful! Thank you dear! Madam. Theres sugar over there. Really? Ill go and get some. A little bit wont hurt. Shes completely disoriented. Shes got no clue where she is. Somebody should talk to her. Yeah? And tell her what? That her whole familys dead? Ive just seen the ships captain. They made him immobilise the lifeboats. And cut all radio communication. What? Thats what I heard. And theyve set up a lab in the hold. This was supposed to be a precautionary quarantine, right? What kind of lab? Theyre hiding something. Otherwise why so much security? Havent you seen the cameras? Theyre all over the boat. You cant even take a piss without them watching you. Theyre pissing me off. Maybe its not such a bad thing. So, looks like you got it working. Good job. You know you could work for naval intelligence. Maybe I could . Seriously? Well, you never know. Wow! Naval intelligence! Listen, I was wondering . Do you think you could access the security cameras from here? Who do you take me for? Well, its just that before, I saw you looking. That was the first thing I did! I keep myself entertained! How do you think I knew she was here? Unbelievable! Dont forget to introduce me. You promised! Yeah, yeah, of course. And the lab? The doors locked and security coded. Seems they dont want us sticking our noses in. Theyve done a good job down there, but they didnt count on Nic. Go, Nic! There you have it. Any idea what theyre up to in there? No idea, but I saw them taking a load of cages in there. God knows what they need cages for. Cages. And that door? You know whats behind it? No idea, there are no cameras in there. But look. This is the maximum zoom we can get. -200%. Not bad, eh? No, not bad at all. Can you do that with all the cameras? Which one do you want? No, not now. Here we go again. What the hell is going on? I dont know what the fuck you do down here all day, but that should be fixed by now. The whole systems down. Really? I hadnt noticed. Is he fucking with us? Maybe where you come from, people dont know much about hard work, but here we do things differently. So fucking sort it out! Im from Spain and here things are done however I fucking feel like it! You heard what I said. Hurry up and sort it! No, no, its all right, its me. What are you doing here? I got scared. Everythings okay. Im with you, okay? Lets go back to the cabins. Wait! Dont tell them, please. Listen to me, nobodys going to hurt you. Nobody. Lets go. This is going to be a force eight, I bet you. And its coming straight for us. Looks like it. Shit. Its going to be here before expected. What did you expect? Its my last voyage . I couldnt go out without a bang! I dont like the look of it. Excuse me. Morning. Morning. This is ngela. Hello. Hello. Weve heard a lot about you! That over there is Goro. And over there is your number one fan. Or so they tell me. Indeed he is. Well, sometimes I watch your show. Im Nic. Hi. Hi. Nics downloading the images from your camera. Well, trying to. My camera? Its here? Do you normally watch them later? I mean on T.V.? No. No, of course not. My favourite was the one with the garbage men, it was so funny! When you jumped in that container, the guy couldnt believe his eyes! Brilliant T.V.! Want one? No. Sorry to ask, but you wouldnt mind, would you? What? If you could do that Hi, Im ngela Vidal. Welcome to thing, but personalised for me. I know its stupid but itd make my day! No, leave it, maybe later. You must be sick of people asking you to do it, I understand. Damn it! Sorry. What a klutz. No, it was me. Its okay. Its waterproof, or at least its supposed to be. In case we sink! Have you seen it? I saw some of the images. I dont know what its all about, but Im glad I wasnt there. Thats it! Done! Now I just have to put them in order. Twenty-five frames per second, itll take a little while. How long? Not long, an hour or so. Maybe less. Sure you dont want one? It tastes good. Lets go. Its gone! The host is gone! What the hell are you talking about? Raise the alarm! No! We need to stay in control. Close everything down. The restraints arent broken. Someone let it out. Thats impossible. They couldnt have got round the security system. Wed have seen them. Not if it was during the blackout. What about the security code? How many people know the code. Very few. Who would do such a thing? It makes no sense. Come with me. Get the Taser and the retroviral. What are you going to do? Find it before it attacks someone. Wed better hope this works. Hey! Whats up with the food? What do you mean? That Filipinos fucking about. Weve been here ten minutes and still no food. Edwin? What the hell? Have you seen this mess? At least it looks like you made an effort today. Are you high or what? The dining rooms full and theyre starting to get hungry, so youd better get moving. Ill take this to the dining room, but get a move on or the shit will hit the fan. Yes! Nice one! Go, Nic! Lamb! Now were talking, gentlemen! I hope youve left some for us. Second shift starts in twenty minutes. If you hurry, youll miss the Navy Marines! What? How are you feeling today? They think I dont know whats going on. Theyve put me in a home without even telling me. Are you feeling hungrier today? No, its not a question of hunger, its a question of my stomach. Could you talk to the waiter? See if he could make me some pasta, or an omelette? Ill go see. But I cant promise anything! Hello? Hello? Hi, sorry, I was wondering if there was anything else? The old ladys got a delicate stomach. Something grilled would be good or . Shit! Come on, just have a taste and then decide. It doesnt smell half bad. Credit where credits due. No! No! Dont eat it! Whats wrong? The chefs like the people in the building! He tried to bite me! Lucas, did he? No. No. Has anyone eaten anything? No. Okay, stay here. Wait! Wait! Stay with her! Dont move! What happened? You tell us. This was supposed to be a precautionary quarantine. Tell me what happened. The chef tried to bite me, thats what happened. Do you know what this means? Where is he? In the kitchen. I managed to shut him in the refrigerator. Okay. Come with us. Just you. Its here already. This is going to be a hell of a party. Are you okay? I dont know. I dont feel well. Must have been something I ate. Im not surprised. Probably that worm you get from raw fish. Anisakis. What? The worms called Anisakis. Whatever you call it. But we didnt have fish today. You should go and lie down. Ill take care of everything. A retroviral. Thats what weve been doing. Weve managed to control two outbreaks in twenty-four hours, but we might not be so lucky next time. How did you do it? We dont know anything about the virus. We know more than you think. We have a sample. We injected it into a healthy host and waited for the symptoms to appear. Hang on. A sample? Where did you get it from? Thats not important. Whats important is that someone let the host out, and now were in big trouble. Fucking awesome! Give him the Taser. Theres no more time to lose. What are you going to do? Test the retroviral. As soon as I open the door, shoot. The shot will paralyse him, but only for a few seconds. Okay. Ready? Now! Out of my way! Come on! Get out! What the hell happened? The virus is feeding, getting stronger. Shit! Thats not possible! Obviously it is! It should have worked. We followed all the steps. Youve obviously lost control. So call whoever you need to and get us the hell out of here! Hes right. Tell them to come and get us. You know the rules. Nobodys coming to get us. Not now. Lets get back to the lab. We have to find out what went wrong. Hey! Wait a minute! And what about us? We dont know if the food is infected. We cant take any risks. No, no, no. No ones eaten anything. Its true. I got here in time. I swear. Then theres no need to worry. No need to worry? Were the second shift! You cant leave us here. As I said, we cant take any risks. Lets go. Wait, wait! I brought you what you asked for. You cant do this to us. What the fuck is he talking about? Im sorry. Lets go. Theres no time to lose. Lucas? What have you done? I took a blood sample from the building. They told me I had to, for all our sakes. You took infected blood? Just a small sample. They said they needed it before blowing up the building. Who? Its not just a simple virus. Some priests came to see me. I saw photos. Things you cant even imagine! That shits not what you think. What else? They know what theyre doing. Theyre financing this whole thing. Son of a bitch! And now what? Okay. I dont know whats going on here, but where are your manners? You dont know whats going on here. Well maybe its about time you knew your whole familys dead! Dead! Leave her alone! Enough! I dont care what that shit is, but if the food is infected, were really screwed. Okay, well go up to the bridge and stay there. Captain Ortega will help us. Really? And how? Were unarmed! Grab anything that we can use. Hurry! Here. Thats not going to help us. Well, its all weve got. Lets go! Lets go! Lets go! Lets go! I dont mean to be rude, but I think Im going to go and lie down. Get back, get back. Go, go, go! Get back, get back! Get off me! Get back! Come on. We have to reach the bridge. Go, go, go! Theyre all over the ship. Its like a fucking plague. Wheres Goro? I dont know. He wasnt feeling well. I told him to go and rest. Shit! Depths of the sea, yes? Everything okay down there? I havent even stopped to eat, if you call that okay. Good, stay there. Dont move until I tell you. Whats going on? Do as I say. Lock the door. Come on, this way. Are you sure? Yes, move it! Could you ask my children to come and get me? Were almost there. Just a few meters. Tell them I wont be any trouble. Lets go! Now what? Have you got nothing better to do than piss me ofF? Hey! What are you doing? Help me! I cant. Shoot it! I cant! I cant! Get it off me! Whats that? Let it go! Let it go! What the hells that? Machine room, loss of oil pressure. Just what we needed! Get out! Let go! Shit! What was that? Are you okay? Yeah. Where is she? Shes gone. Fuck me! What are we going to do? You go up to the bridge. Ill look for her. Hey! Where the fuck are you going? Youre unarmed, shes got no chance. Its suicide. We cant leave her. Someone has to go. I fucked up. I owe you. Lets go. Its us! Open up! Wait! Its us! Open the door! We dont know if theyre infected. Open up! Open the door! Nic! Come on! Close it! Close it now! What the hells going on out there? The quacks have fucked us over, right? The situations changed. From now on, youre back in charge. Were going home. I wish I could. The engines leaking oil. If it overheats, it could catch fire. I have to turn it off. No! Calm down! You dont know what that thing is! Wait! We could try the backup engine. Start it up. I cant from here. It can only be started from the engine room. Shit! Shit! What the fuck is this? You were in the building, you should know! I dont know anything, but those doctors do. If were going to stand any chance, we need to know what they know. Oh, sure! How shall we do that? Are you going to go out there and take a survey? Their computers. Do you think you can access them? They put me online to send them the camera images. Theyve handed it to us on a plate. Okay, its what I thought. The systems encrypted and reinforced. Whats that? Nothing serious. I hope. I dont understand, everythings in order. It should have worked. Maybe the virus mutates according to the hosts DNA. That would make each strain different. We need the original strain, free of mutations. The girl. And obviously, we dont have her. Gentlemen, its game over. No, wait. There must be another way. Im very sorry. You know the protocol. No! Twenty minutes. Make the most of them. No, listen! We could try to modify the DES1 enzyme, then the membranes will become more rigid and we could delay the virus reaching the DNA. That will just slow down the process. It wont help. Not without the original strain. Im sorry. Please. You cant. There was no room for error. You know the rules. Wait! The boys done it! Weve got the camera images. Go, Nic! All yours. How can I find the oldest files? Lets see. Here. What is all this? What the fuck? Wait, wait. I saw that name in the building. In the attic. There were newspaper cuttings with that name. Its her! Its the same girl. The place was full of her photos. Information about a hospital admission, ordered by the Diocese of Naples. Priests? Para-scientific diagnosis, what the fuck is this? Wait. The cuttings were about the girl being possessed or something. About the Church. The Devil. Stop fucking around, man! It makes sense. They admitted her to get medical confirmation. The doctor in charge . What a surprise. Whats that? It cant be. Yes, it can. Its the girl. What the hell was she doing there? Rewind. What is this? God! A parasite. The source of the virus. It was right in front of our noses! This was the devil they were searching for? A parasite? That thing was controlling the girls body and mind and used her as a transmitter. But it kept her immune to protect itself. Clever. Its been growing inside the girl all these years. Until it found a better host. The original strain. Weve got it! Get everything ready. Surgical material. We have to get that thing out of her. We can still stop this! Madam. Madam, come on. We have to find the others. You have to trust me. No, no, no. Fuck you! Dont move! Drop your weapon and turn around slowly. Wheres the girl? On a cruise! Last chance. Where is she? Whats wrong? No answer? And theres not going to be. Then we have to go down there and do it ourselves. We have to start that engine. Easy. Except Im not planning on going out there. And what do you suggest? We just wait here for those things to come get us? Listen, this was my last voyage. And no one wants to go home more than me. But I want to make it alive. Open up! Lucas. Open up, please! Hey, hey! What are you doing? Nobody touch her! Get away from her. Stand aside! Whats going on? Its a parasite. Its inside her. Its the source of the virus. What? What are you talking about? We saw it on the video. How it went inside her. You can see for yourself . What are you talking about? You said she was clean. She is. That thing keeps its host immune. Thats how it goes unnoticed. Careful! We need her alive! Tell them to let her go. Youre making a mistake. Let her go. That guns not loaded. But this one is. Dont you understand? This parasites the original strain. Its the only way to make the retroviral. Thats why it didnt work before. Theres no other way. I dont care. Please be reasonable. We only have to extract it. She doesnt need to get hurt. No, no, no! Theyre lying! Youre a doctor. You have experience controlling epidemics. You know this is the only way. Well never get her to the lab like this. On that table. Well do it there. Hurry! Nic! Nic! Be careful! On her back. Help me! Grab her head. Tie her down. Like that. Good. Wait a minute, and if its a mistake? I told you, its on video. You can see it yourselves. Times running out. Nic! Hold her down. I cant find it. We saw it. It has to be there. Doctor. Dont move. Push her head back. I need towels! In the bathroom. Quickly! Hurry! Hold her down! What the hells going on? Help me! I dont have a shot! Shoot! Shoot! Whats going on? Get her! Dont let her escape! Its superficial. Its nothing. Wait. The DES1 will work. You said so yourself. We can still find the girl and make the antidote. You know theres no time. You still need me. Not any more. And now what? Now we find the girl! No! This is over. Stop fucking around and call for help. Youre the only one who can use the radio. Not without an antidote. Youll never do it. Youre crazy. Well if I dont, I can assure you that very soon therell be nowhere to go back to. Lets go! Were wasting time. Walkie-talkies on frequency 9. She cant have gone far. Shit! Okay, fuck this. Can you pilot the ship? I can try, Ive helped a couple of times, but I dont know. Okay, well go down and get the backup engine started. Do you know how? I think so. But I cant go down there, Im sorry. Hes right, all we have is four kitchen knives, which wont take us very far. Are you fucking kidding? Any better ideas? Wait, theres some fishing material stored on the stern deck. Fucking great! Now were going fishing! Okay, you stay here. Well go and grab whatever we find. Well come back and then all go down to the engine room. Lock the door. We need you alive, youre the only one who can pilot this ship. Stern, this way. This is a fucking maze. Well never find it! Over there! Got her! Shes in the cabin corridor. Where? Cabin corridor. Lets go! Lets go! No! Shit! Shes smashing the cameras! Weve lost her. Where is she? Shit! Got her! Dining room corridor. Go, go, go! Quickly! Hurry! ngela, no! Here! Its Nic. The walkie-talkie, pick up the walkie-talkie. Pick it up! Come on, come on, pick it up. Do it! Okay! Now, dial 7. Dial 7, come on! Dial 7, dial 7! Nic? Good. Were alone now. I can see you. But I cant help you if you smash the cameras. Okay. Now get the hell out of there. Theyre coming for you. What the fuck are you doing? You have to get out of there! Theyre right behind you! What are you doing? Theyll be there any minute! ngela, listen to me. You have to get out of there right now. Go! Why did you do that? Come on! Go, go! Take this! What the fuck are you doing, Lucas? Come on! Lets go! Its party time! Where is she? How did you lose her? She was here! Careful! Where the hell is she? Help! Fucking help me! Get it off me! The fire extinguisher! Get the fire extinguisher! Move! Hurry! Help! I dont know how it works. Its head! Hit it on the head! Youre wrong. I dont know what you want from me, but youre wrong. Now check it. Go back to your fucking lab and check it. Then tell them to leave me alone. Im sorry. What now? Were unarmed. Go home. Wait! What happened to your hand? Youve been bitten. Nic? Are you there? ngela, fuck! I saw you! Why did you do that? You have to trust me. I need the access code to the lab. What? Fuck! I have to prove to them that theyre wrong! But . Please! But you bit him, ngela. I saw it on the camera. Trust me, Nic! We can get out of this together. But I need that code. Please. Nic! Okay. Ive got it. Guzman showed me how to get it from the camera above the door. Here it is. I hope you know what youre doing. It cant be. It cant be. Yes, it can. I saw it on the video. I saw it enter your body. I dont care what you saw. I dont know what youre looking for, but its not me. Harpoons. Yes, harpoons Is that all? Okay. Fine. Well go down there, youll get the engine started and were done. And then go home. Hang on. ngelas okay. Theres nothing in her. Ricarte checked, I saw it on the camera. Theyre in the lab. We have to go and get her. Okay, Ill go. You two go down to the engine room. Well meet back here. Now tell them! Its impossible. There must be a mistake. Theres no mistake. Tell them right now to leave me alone or I swear Ill kill you. Tell them now! Tell me what? The parasite leaves its host when it finds a better one. She was the best way to get it out of the building. The video doesnt lie. Weve all seen it. I dont care what you saw but your tests dont lie either. Thats true. If it were inside her youd be infected. She bit you. I know! But there must be an explanation. Shes lying. Is that true, ngela? Are you lying? And you? Are you lying? Why did you want the lab access code? You asked Nic for it. What for? I wanted to know what they were doing in there. Didnt you? Last night in the corridor, you were coming back from the lab, werent you? You used the power cut to let the monkey out. Really? And why would I do such a thing? You rescued me from the building. We were alone almost a minute. If that thing was in me . It leaves its host when it finds a better one. Wasnt that it? Exactly. So the old host is of no more use. Youre brave ngela, I love that . Auto-destruct protocol activated. Twenty minutes. AII personnel evacuate immediately. Its over. Fuck you! Where do you think youre going, ngela? Careful with that, dont hurt yourself. Evacuate immediately. Now its party time. Detonation in eighteen minutes. Evacuate immediately. Wait! Get back! Get back! Come on, Nic! Lets go! This way. Is this it, Nic? Yes. Hurry, hurry! Shit!
