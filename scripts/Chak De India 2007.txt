After the first matcb thrashing by Australia, lndias chance of surviving in the tournament, looks very slim chance. The only chance they have is to beat England in tomorrows match. Looking at their team form, there is no hope for them to win the match. Looking at their team form, there is no hope for them to win the match. You all must keep on passing to one another.

The short was very fast. No chance for the goal keeper to save the goal. Haliya Bose. Second penalty miss for lndia. The gap bas become wide and their hope looks slim. lf lndia wants to stay they can't afford to lose even single stroke. And they have to stop the penalties by australian side.
