In America, more than 60% of prisoners from the ethnic minorities ... ... three quarters of all people for drugs cases in jail are black people. I am a sinner, a good life trying to drive. THE REVENGE OF CAIN I hear drums in my head. I live in a jungle drum and horn. The drums speak with me. The drums are, baby. There is nothing can be done. My son Ricky Sells drugs to survive. He is a threat to society. See his own errors. "We know we have passed from death to life ... because we love our brothers. Who does not love staying in death. ' Kill, after this torture ... ... sounds almost like a warm comfy bed sheets where I can crawl under. It must be nice to the bathroom just for you to have. I said "it should be fine ..." - I heard you. Why are you talking to me, asshole? Sorry, I just tried to enter into a conversation, I'm just here. You say something like what you asked, understand? So you know the bastard? Yeah, Red. I got it checked. He has been detained along with my cousin. Let your cousin strain. What do you know him? I know him from the neighborhood, Red.

Perfect. - Perfect. Next time, less tense. Until then, Sleepy. I'll see you again, T. What did I do? What did I tell you, Red? Okay, okay. - So I want to hear. Police! Stand. - Dare not to move. Do not do it, Sleepy. Sit. Prisoner! I hope you like it here. Over there. I do not know what you've done out there, but you're in my house. Your house? By the end of the week I have to say here. I said you should keep your mouth. Hey, Cain. Redfoot. The peace is over. I've already covered. - I go Redfoot. I want to be sure that what happened is past. You know, that shit was just anything for. Get out, Redfoot. I said get out. I don bag how to solve ... So, think about it, and let me know. I've broken your leg so you do not more drugs in my club can bring .. to have my case in the spotlight. Tell the men to go home. You have his legs broken? More or less. That was one of Redfoot's men. To the club? - Yes. I gotta tell you something here, Red. I just want you to mess in my club brings. You put my case in the spotlight. Your club is in my part of town. And your part of town ends at my front door. We have a kind of agreement. - We have an agreement. You know, your husband ...? - Yes. He's in the alley, he can see all give details. Okay? Be careful, mate. He's inside. Bring your other girls too. Call me when you're at the door. Shit! I'll call you back. Breathe out, baby. Stay there. Stay there! - Dad! Keep him. - Dad! Welcome to the prison. I am the director of this facility. My friend Joe and I want to make sure it's the last place where you will end up. You are here because of robberies, abuse, gang activity ... Here, you are slaves of the system. You have a choice. You may or you can free slaves. This house, these walls and prison ... give you a name, your slave name and number. The director here, is your boss. He's the one you tell when you eat, sleep and shit. I am the bastard, Fredrick Douglas ... kick you to the underground, the freedom outside these walls ... to project, and "One Unity" and "Pipeline". Today make a choice. Live free or die within these walls. Life is choices ... ... choose the right one. He walks and talks ... ' you know. " What's up, Sleepy? - Hey, Red. So you're finally here too. - Man, they had me in jail forever. Was it so? For as I've heard you tried to be placed anywhere but here ... ... with me. To Thurs not dead, Ed. Why should I do not want to be with my measurements? I do not know, perhaps because I am sitting here because of you. But it's just the way, right? Red, you know I will compensate you sure, man. - You're going to compensate me? How? This is my third time, Sleepy. - What? You know I've got 203 years? As if I live long. The judge thought sure I was a tree, huh? How long did you have? Why?! - Red, I was not the one who tackled the money. Sleepy? - Yes. If you are true, and I need out of these walls have done something then you had better make it happen. Whatever you want, Red. Sleepy? - Yes. I love you. - I love you too. We have the same ... I know. Okay. I love you. Red, do not go along ... Red ... Troy Say I need his help. I'm going to Redfoot ass. One against one. Troy say that I had this one am guilty. Tell Derek that I need cash. Tell him that it is worthwhile for me. And that's me guilty. I will collect. Many of my soldiers are in here. It's like a family reunion. Cain! There is nothing you can do to my anxiety to hunt. And I am afraid. I'd have to give four months but given the current circumstances, two. You will lose all privileges: music recreation, nothing. You may not leave the cell. Cain, the time you have left You forced me to one third of your remaining away life. To do something again, I hope you think about it. Hey, that girl there? - She has just been on. Hey, dude. - What is it, boy? Respect. It's about Ricky. Do you think I should talk to him? I was thinking, he has everything from east to 3rd Street. And you have everything else. Why do not you come together? What? So you're saying that the negro and I have to do business together? Just, you lead the two largest neighborhoods. And together you can take the entire city to take over. Do you understand me? Listen, I want that best control. Hi, Mike? - How are you? Got all settled his birthday our homie? You know who I am. I have more women he knows not what he should do. Whose birthday? - My size, Robert. Oh, yeah, you all go back to childhood. You just make sure you're there. - Yeah. Where is Ricky? Where is Ricky? - In the back room. What? - I need you to come and watch. Get out. I voted against this homie said he did not need messing with JD. Here is my answer The Negro is a barbarian, homie. It's time he goes on''holiday''. What do you have today, big man? Cain, all right there? Yeah? - Is anybody here with me? I see nobody. You know, you've always tried to me to read the Bible. Yes. - Today is the day. It's a great day for you, Cain Do you play saxophone still in the recording room? No ... The director forbade. He said he has no manpower had. - For extra activities. I never come here to leave. That I accept. It is very difficult without my music. If I play it's like I'm not. - Yes. Damn, I miss that. I gotta go. I'll see you next week. I heard that you provide for Cain. Yes. - Now is your big chance to impress him. You have a long time spent in solitary confinement, Cain. Every time I let you out, you get back from something stupid. I know you usually defend yourself as you are the 'big boss' are. There are plenty of people who think that if you down ... that they be notorious or famous, or something. That's why you always keep going to the hole, year after year. You know, we have children who come here. Half of them want to know if here Cain trapped. They see you as a movie star. You and I know that your life is not so glamorous. If I were to tell you a chance to make this does not happen again with the boys from near it? What if you could help? What if you can pick up life you've wasted ... and used that to save them? What if I tell you: you have a chance to save your son. Do you? What's in it for me? What do you mean? - If I containers with little prick, what good is this? The ability to help is already a reward in itself. Okay, what do you want? I want you to give Willie his saxophone back and to let him play. You want me to give Willie his saxophone back and to let him play? I can not do. That's a security risk. We do not have enough staff to allow such a thing. Let him play in the hole section. There is no safety because we are locked 23 hours a day. That is outrageous. Well, like it or not. Remember ... Director It's for the children. Okay. But if there is a blunder ... it's over. Fine. JD Parker, drug dealer, armed murderer .. ... and like all of us fed by power and greed. But the difference with him is that no longer safe on the street as he is. What is it? Let's go drink something first with the homies, and we go to one of your student bars. Okay, JD, serious, man. Come with me to Berkeley. I have that very flat. Remember that you have paid my tuition fees? As I said, do not say it to the boys. I do not want everyone to stop his hand. You know, one of us must fit the neighborhood. Come on, the homies are waiting for us. What's up, guys? Is that one of the homies? Damn no! Come on! - Happy birthday! I build a party with my homies Is that right? Now? Okay, thanks. We will see. My tailor said they have a party at their club. - Yes? That bastard thinks he has done Mike, can get away. The fucking with him and his homies. Only JD. I do not kill the whole gang, I want nothing to do. Come on, why do you do really worried about the idiots? You heard what I said. Yeah, yeah. I told you so, just JD. - I told you, Mike! Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon. - Drop your weapon! Your hands and dare not move around. I will direct to the point. Your son Ricky has just been tried. Accessory to murder. Seven and half years. Sorry, Cain. I'm sorry that this happened just now, but ... - No, I have my son talk. We will guide you to the courtyard there you can talk to him. But you have to behave. How are you, son? Do not call me son. What is it? This does not all me. What? - Look ... We're on my turf, we do it by my rules. Fuck your rules on me. - You're a gangster, huh? What are you doing here? Listen, do you get the clothes. Fuck rules. Who wants to talk, homie. - Like father like son. Is that your explanation? - I do not have time for that nonsense, man. No. All you have here is time. What do you want from me, partner? Life is choices. I hope you choose to forgive me. The easy way or hard, I do not bag. Go fuck yourself with. Do not, Motherfuckers! Do not! Jesus! I've already gone through this project sucks. See all those assholes here? Let them get the discount, you know what I mean? Do you have gum? My name is Cain. Yeah, I know of the Seas Tones ... You there, why do you talk so loud? I'm here, just talking asshole. You come of the Seas Tones. Before? I always heard the stories to you how crazy it was not. From my Uncle. You remember him perhaps. His name was Big Al. Yeah, I remember Big Al ... A stupid idiot. - That's heavy balls, man. He's dead. Yeah, I know. He was slain during a robbery at a liquor store next to the police station. As I said, an idiot. Apparently you're just as stupid. The 'Unity One' and 'PipeIine' are interested in you. I ... Sit still, you bastard! I do not bag for you. I'm here to tell you what happened with you If you end up in a cell, with a nigger like me. Returning to a dentist? - Yes. Aaa Say ... Open your mouth further open. Keep in mind that position. And you, nigger, put your hat off. Oh, yeah ... Do your hair down. Hang it forward. You have that beautiful hair ... Oh, yeah, that's really beautiful. Are you part Indian? - Yes. What? you have a problem with something, nigga. I have a crush on you. We will take you to graze, rookie. I bow but no one, nigga. What ...? That's enough. Stop it. You go back into the cell. Go back in line. - Your days are numbered. By walking. Now Do I turn this thing around your head! Do not be scared, Mama's boy. Let the black alone. Yeah, I remember your first day here. You were just like that little fucking bag. Long, handsome, black, nice and fresh. I want you to take your ass, but did not do it. Now you must reciprocate. What are you doing? Back to work. And you two hell out of here. Thank you, Cain. Do not thank me, nigga. Do you only for personal protection. I just want to serve my time, and get out of here I am not interested me with someone in order. It does not work, boy. As if I said Thank you, Caine. Listen, I want you to clean up. I'll be back. All this stuff? - Everything. Clean up the mess. Forward. Back to work. It looks stupid do you understand me? Listen nigga, that's why we're here. Can you help me with? It's about survival, Homie. On the side, nigga. I have two of you together uilskuikens spades. I can not let you do, brother. Let's keep the peace. If someone goes to my son to fuck, there will be no peace. You're the boss because I am not. But if I'm going to do it again ... I swear to God that the bad end for those that they involve. Do you understand me? I heard what you have done for me, homie. Listen, man. You do not save me, nigga, I'll take care of myself, okay? You're my son. I make sure that you nothing happens whether you like it or not. What, nigga? You're the reason my mother died. What are you talking about? Come on, talk. Why a life anyway? A kind of fake Bonnie and Clyde. A novelty, nigga. They died together. And you still alive and remains dead. And you have slain her. I thought so You know me, dick. I have nothing to say, nigga. For me, my mother and father are dead. Prisoners, stop that nonsense! - We're good friends. I told them to stop. - What you want, boss. I speak to Cain. - Where are you going, slut? I speak to Cain. I want to thank you for me trying to do. Keep going, man. How often have I not tell you you have to do what I tell you? Now let me see that we have naughty sissy. I've had visitors last night. - Last night? From whom? William ... Big Phil. From Southside? You have slain them years ago. They're all dead. I know. But it came by. I've heard you again, Willie. Cain ... ... I am grateful. You have brought me back into music. Another song request? - Surprise me. Sure, Cain. Sure, man. I know why you're here. And I know who you are. You are my sin. A family that is complete. My sin .... ... has finally caught up with me. Mr.. Parker, on behalf of the state I I am here to represent you. I think you have to admit guilt. I'm sorry, Mr.. Parker, I can not understand. - Thurs here! Thurs here! Cain! I need help right now! You have to take. What? You do not know yet? - What do not I? How long do you have? - I've got 127 years to go. I have good news and bad news. The good news is that significantly reduce your sentence. The bad news is that you have a brain tumor. What? It's just one convicted. He gets what he deserves. How do you feel, Mr. Skinner. - How do you think I feel? I'm Dr. Zeltzer, your neurosurgeon. What a day. I have successfully biopsy samples taken. But your tumor was too large to remove it. He was as big as a tangerine. What are you talking about? Tell me honestly. I'm sorry to have to say, Mr. Skinner. The prospects are not good. You have about six months to live. I am really sorry. All favors are, Chain. I still need one. I need to talk with my son. Take it out. Damn, man. You really begin to take your pills. I take no pills. No, man. By the pills I feel like a plant I'd rather feel the pain. Pain let me feel alive. I'd rather hurt. Okay. I gotta talk to you, Ricky. - I do not talk to you, nigga. Hey! Who do you think you're talking to? - That's between me and my father. If you keep your head, maybe you learn something. This nigga here? - Are you smarter? Certainly not more stupid than this clown. Yeah, you're so smart, you've arrived here. - He's still here too. Yeah, and he was also an asshole. But now he has at least experience on his side. Sit down. Listen ... I'm only half as large as 90% of the prisoners here I guarantee you that I last person I want to piss you off. Ricky, you must shut up. Can I just be alone with my son, please? I'll wait in the hallway. What do you say nigga? You mean nothing to me. I know. I know I have nothing proposal. And I know I mean nothing to you, I know what you mean. Why do you always talk to me? - Because there no longer will be. Therefore. If you moved? - Yes, I transferred. That's good, because that would not through with you. Where they send you the way to go? I have a brain tumor. What? - I have a brain tumor. Damn! Why are you telling me this? Do you expect that I pity you do? - No, not me, nigga. No, I do not want pity. We are father and son. During the last days I have left on earth, I thought that we have a normal conversation could carry. And I said all this nonsense of you kill for me .. It was silly really. No, that shit was true. I was really dying for you. I was not there for you. I was dead to me. I was dead for my family. You're right. That I earned. God works in mysterious ways. I had a lump in my family. So God has blessed me,''''with cancer. So are God's ways, son. You get back what you entered. Listen, my brothers ... God will forgive you everything ... if you do repent from your heart. It must come from your heart. The pain from your heart. And the conversion must also come from your heart. And he will not easily forgive. That's our man, just. You make an error on this planet, , and connect you through life. Do you understand me? - Yes. "Son, I'm not saying I do not know what love is ... I do not know if anyone I ever loved. But ... ... I feel something in my heart for you. I'm a sissy, I'm not saying I do yours. I say something in my heart I feel for you. Do you understand me? - Sure, Dad. Cain? Here is the book you've asked me. BRAIN TUMORS Cain, everything okay there? Can you play something quiet today? Yeah, right. Sure. Smoke there is only one. - Thanks. Have you been removed from the hole? Yes, the director has given me one hour with you, but I had some company with you. - That's right. Does it hurt? Yeah, it takes a while before the pain goes away. Did she tell you how long you have left? Long enough. "Son, I want you to promise me something. Is your punishment here. And promise me you'll never come back. And you also ensure that others not reach here. The fucking with the elite. Cain ... - Yes. - I need a favor. - For Harlow? I see that you can handle right now. They favor ... I come to collect. - What favor? I'm not talking to you, nigga. - Watch what you say, pal. So that's the deal? - Yes, that's about it, what are you doing? My favor. - Let us know. I need help ''stuff''to get inside. What kind of''stuff''? Same as always. I'm 23 hours a day in solitary. How to get your stuff in here? That's not my problem. When you asked me for help, I asked not 'How do I manage that? " I just did it. - I hear you, homie. You see, loyal soldiers. So they're gone. - I understand, it goes on, but then we're done with that bastard. With everything. - Do it, nigga. Cain, you have to take medicines. You have a lot of pain. - I take no medication. I know you do not want to take, but you have to take them. Shut up. Cain, the drugs are not only for pain management. Raise your hand against me. Get out of here. I take no medicine Get out of here so I can control. Monitoring! The blood of Jesus. The blood of Jesus. The blood of Jesus. The blood of Jesus. The blood of Jesus. The blood of Jesus. - How you doing, Dad? Tell me, son? - What did the doctor say? That does not matter. The Lord will never give you if you can bear. Remember that. The life I lead, is the life I was given ... In the name of Jesus. Amen. You know son, this is a blessing in disguise. This is God's way of allowing me in touch with my son to come. A band to build. That I understand. - Pray with me? Yeah, we can pray together. Your hand ... Jesus ... I thank you for your time I gave up on this planet a link with my son to build. Jez In ... - Dad! Dad! Guardian! He's under a heavy anesthetic. - How long do you think this will take? It's hard to say, if and when he wakes up. He should at least do continue to take his medication. Okay. They told me you were the bastard in here. - And you are? The bastard out. - That means nothing for the asshole in here. What if I and my boys beyond triple your profit? As for myself I get rid of some, but a little ... As I am in here who wants to try to get the bastard. I thought you wanted to a bastard who can arrange this for you. My asshole. The session today was good, man. I think we have approached the children well. A life of crime is real shit man. You end up in a place like this, that kind Hellegatsplein. Joe ... I need a favor. Give this to my soldier, Derek. Cain is at your visit. Cain's in the hole. He has asked the director Pipeline project, or that you can participate. So you can meet. Brother Cain ... What's wrong? I want somebody ass. But it does not have to do with you. Who are we? Why? JD Parker. I'm not gonna tell you details but nobody fucking with my son. I do business with JD. - Not anymore. Is that right? So shall my word for anything now? Your word for me what does not. So you had to come alone. I thought that a card would have to choose. Do not be like I did not protect you, you know that? You run the drug trade because I allow. But JD ... A dead guy. And try not to turn ... do not you dare to think that a nigga like me to get the go a nigga like you ... to get something done. It's time to do something about it. - For sure. Cain, the bastard of a son, Derek, I want them all dead. Damn, homie, Cain is something like a legend here You are about to become history. Take the bastard to graze. And hell out now. Got? I warned you, nigga, watch what I do with that sissy. Do you understand me? Do not fool me. - Spread the word. Yes. - Yes, I will tell you about. - Get out of here. How did my deal for you? - Better than expected. I'm 25% for you. Sit. You know what? Let 20% of it. Consider it a favor. And give me the opportunity to do business with you. This is the plan what we're doing. You may have Ricky. But Cain, that crazy dick will come after you. Do not worry about. We have this in the right way. Do you understand? Cain has some followers here and war is bad for business. I control where and when. You take Ricky to your account I assume that a gorilla Cain on me. You and I go together with money. That is agreed. Cain, I need to know the truth. Everyone is silent about this, but I know it's going to come. I hear drums in my head. I live in the jungle when I hear the drums. The drums talk to me. The storm is coming, baby. And there's nothing you can do about. Nothing. And I'm the one who has the most to lose. We're talking about my son. We're still talking about my son. I know you like the palm of my hand. And I know there is nothing you would not do for your son. Includes self sacrifice. You can not do. - You would be put aside. This is a prison, Cain. Some of the most dangerous criminals walk around here. We can not do. That JD ... ... is a killer. I see it in his eyes. You know what that means. I have to kill JD. - No. No. Yes. - That's not happening in this prison. This is exactly the kind of conduct allowing you the hole goes straight back. Do you do what I must do Do you back? I try very patient with you again. - Can I go? ... I know how you look at me like those who sit in the tubs ... and when the morning brings me the news, of your unrequited love. Who are you? - His name is JD. Is there another way to solve this problem? Not if the life of my son on the set state. What about you to me? - I thought we were headed a different direction. We read the Bible and praying trying to save another's soul. I do not want no bad reason. It's not that I'm scared or something. You are one of the hardest gangsters I know. I know you're not afraid. You've grown. God has a route for you sometimes secretly approaching. Follow a better leader like me. I must do this. Do you have that thing for me? I'll handle it. Now what? - You tell me. I tried to say that asshole. - You should have done. The only thing I think you to tackle to take. Ricky, I'm so glad to see you. I can think of nothing else. Money, Freedom, hookers ... ... to nowhere, just to you. - I need your partner is not slain. What happened, happened. We had not as you know Mike had not been murdered. dir At present, I do not care what brought us here. The only thing I care about is that we are here. There should you worry about it. Look, nigga. I was against the homie said you had to wait until we talked. But he suddenly began to shoot. I did not kill partner. I just wanted to scare you. We will see how fast you come here. Whatever you want, nigga, but I'll tell you another thing. You tired ... your dad ... and your fucking kids ... stand by your coffin nigga, and look at dead bloody body. That's the key you just have turned the lock.
