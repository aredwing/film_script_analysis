Kiba... Okaminosuke. Kiba? Kiba (teeth). Like these. Hey you! Are you trying to interrupt the Kazama Dojo's fighting practice? It's a weird practice also your skills are very soft. Like this persimmon. What?! Are you trying to find fault with our fighting style? Isn't your style already faulty? Damn you! It's okay now. You go home now! But you can't go like that. Okay, you go home! Hey, stop it! I'm glad! Is she crazy? - Kiba Okaminosuke? He's a rogue! Anyway, I wanted to report to you. What fighting style did he use? I'm not sure, but it was lai-Giri (Quick-draw). He was very skillful! Stand up! - Huh? Stand up, Gunbei! - Sensei! Draw your sword. Attack me the way he used lai-Giri! Come on! Did you understand? The Kazama dojo teachings will beat any lai-Giri. Kiba, I, Ikkaku will kill you! We're going to take a break here. - Yes. - Hey, let's take a break! Wait! You can't drink that water! Who are you? You are irresponsible! If you think I am lying, you better try that first. - He is right! This water is from Mount Higasa and it's contaminated with poison. The farmers who lived around here left because of that. Hey, please give me water! I don't care if it's contaminated or not, because I am going to be a sun-dried human body soon! Shut up! What are you complaining about? My body is going to crack open very soon! It's one of the punishments for you! When you get thirsty, you better think about what you've done! Didn't your policy say that one must respect even a bad wolf? What's that? Hey hey hey, who gave you permission? Don't get so uptight and have one! Hey, Karubei! What's your name? Kiba Okaminosuke. I am the thief, "Black cat" who broke into the house of a Samurai. I am not just a petty thief but big time. Didn't you ever hear my name before? No, I didn't. Would you like to have some? You have a weird name, but you're considerate. He so resembles him... During his lifetime, my father made his living by 'Dojo Yaburi' (Raiding Dojos and beating them all up for money) INN I was always hungry. Hey hey, how long were you following us? If you don't stop following us, you will be arrested too. Officer, what did that ronin do? This is very sweet! You really don't know? He is Kawazu Magobei who went after a Shogunate official, Mishina Mondo-san. And killed him. Mount Higasayama's gold mine was closed down a year ago. Mishina-sama was patrolling there when Magobei killed him. What for? I think he killed him because he just didn't like an officer. Hey! Are you Takada-sama who came from the castle town? That's right. I came from Nishida village over there and the officers escorting criminals were poisoned by bad water... Bad water? - Yes. They must get to the administration office in Arakawa by end of the day. We know this is too much to ask of you, but the chief who is very sick hopes that you'll let us join your group, Takada-sama. Do you have the letter? Oh, that woman is Oni-Azami Oren. She had an affair with the Magistrate of Nishida Town. But in the end, she was dumped. Her revenge was to kill him and burn down his house. Let's go! Hey, can't you move more smoothly! It'll be smooth at the office. But after that, we don't know... - Then, we'll all be crucified, isn't that what you mean? But can you bring us there safely? Shut your stupid mouth! Magobei, this is your final journey. Look! Someone came to say good-bye. Hello! We're from Arakawa to take over the escort. Let's check their identities. - Thanks. Be my guest. You're breaking our promise! It doesn't make any difference if you die here or if you're crucified in Edo. Die now! - You swine! Even a child can kill a man who is caged and helpless. Withdraw! Magobei, who were they? I don't know. - What? There must be a reason they wanted to kill you. Tell me! Stop it! He told you that he doesn't know, didn't he? Anyway, if you don't move, they'll come back again. Kiba-san can you escort them to the administrator's office in Arakawa? I will pay you. How much? How about 2 ryo? Very well! Please, let me talk to him in private. I want you to tell me about your secret. If I don't know who wants to kill you, I can't protect you. I was betrayed. A man named Higasa Jinroku used me. Higasa Jinroku? He's hiding on Mt. Higasa. He and his crews were digging the secret gold mine, I happened to be passing by one day, and he used me to kill the officer patrolling the mine. And he promised to keep me from getting in trouble. Idiots! We have so many, but nobody can kill just one man? It was waste to hire the officers to spring a trap! The reason he agreed to kill the officer for you was that he just wanted the gold. If we don't kill that man, the gold mine will be found... - Father! Father! - Oteru! Who did this to you? - I did it. Oteru was out of control. She went out today and came back in only her underwear... - Moron! He always screams at us, but not Oteru, she's spoiled... - Mind your own business! She's your sister! If you do this to her again, I won't forgive you! Listen, we can't waste any more time! If Magobei reaches Arakawa, we can't do anything. Jirota, this time you go! Somehow, you must send him to Hell! Why are you worried about me? Have we met before? Maybe we did. You resemble my father a lot. Your father? Do I look so old? I was just a child when he was killed. Was he a samurai? A ronin. Then, you are a Second generation ronin, aren't you? For sure, I don't want a Third... My father specialized in Dojo yaburi (Dojo breaking) To make a living. If I am not wrong, it was right after his Dojo yaburi in Koshu - I was only Seven years old... Sixth Year of Tenpo (1835), late Autumn. After that fight, he became a wanted man. And... ... he ended his life like seaweed in the ocean. I see... but I am not like your father who was so nave... Oddly, as I listened to your story, I felt as if I knew him. I'm sure that you know what I am thinking now, don't you? Let's be partners! I'll pay you a lot of money. And if I refuse? Do you want to be a poor ronin forever? Magobei, I'm following you so I can see how you free yourself from this cage. What are you mumbling about? Just keep your eyes... Withdraw! Withdraw! Kiba, we came here to get you! The men who left were my students. I don't want them to get hurt. Come on! Wait! Get ready, Kiba! Wait! Please wait until tonight! to guard these cages and they paid me in advance. Are you trying to run... - Wait! Is he telling us the truth? Yes, he is. If they leave now, they can arrive by tonight in Arakawa-juku and his duty will be over. All right! I'll be meet you around Do you agree? I promise, I will be there! Thanks! Listen to me! Stay alive until then! We heard what happened on your trip. Thank you for your effort. Let's take care of your injury. First let me see the Magistrate... I'm sorry, the Magistrate and the others aren't here. They can't cross the river because of this heavy rain Kaga-sama helped us get back, but we couldn't return for the others. We only have these Right here. Please get some rest! My duty is done! I want to say that everything will be alright, but I sense that it will not. Sir Samurai! Please don't let them kill me! I don't want to die! Hey, what's with you? You're a 'big time' robber! I am not a 'big' timer, just a 'small-time' thief! My name is not 'Black cat'! I lied to you! This is the first time in my life! - Shut up! Hey, thank you! I will take over, so you can go now. It's almost 11:00 O'clock... - Hey Kiba! Won't you change your mind? Can't you stay here until morning? Kiba! Stop it! Even if you beg him, it's not going to change anything! Let's give up and see if God will help us... Officer, you better nail up this door! Nail it up? If they get killed here, it will be your responsibility and it's Hara Kiri for you. So you better take care of them until everybody returns. Wait! You disappoint me. You're a dirty dog! Just a Guard dog! No wonder, you are the son of a ronin! Where are your fangs? Calm down! You ingrate! You're alive only because I protected you until now! From now on, you're on your own! So long! And also take care of Kihachi and Oren-san, too! Here comes Okaminosuke. As I promised. I was looking forward for this moment. Don't rush to your death! If you're trying to get me angry, it won't work! Let's finish this next time! Damn it! Hey officer, please let me have some of your sak! Please let me have just one sip before I die. It's against the rules. I have money. What? I see? I have it to pay the toll for the bridge to Heaven. It's sewn into my collar. Where? Lower. Here. Here, drink it! Sir, let me use my hands to take a drink, please! You're too much! Just while you take a sip. Wait! Oren! Oren! Let go! Quickly! What's wrong? Open up! Nagira-san, what's going on? Let me get out of here too! If you don't let me out, I am going to tell about your secret gold mine! Let me out! Set me free! Hurry! Hurry! Kihachi! Damn it! Wait! I'll make him really suffer! Take him to the "Valley of the crows". Mago-san, wait for me! Mago-san... Mago-san. I'll cross the mountain and go to Bushu. Oren, you're a good woman. Live well! Wait, please! I am not going to leave you, so please take me with you! How many men have you deceived? What are you saying? My work has just started. I don't have the time for you! Damn you! Who wants to fall love with a man like you! Animal! Murderer! Heartless fool! You're probably from the Higasa family, aren't you? You're looking for someone else! What's your name? My name is Oni-Azami Oren. You guys scared me when I was in the cage. I am sure that you escaped with Magobei. Where is Magobei? Wait a minute! Don't rush to conclusions! I have a grudge against him, too! I want you to chop him up right in front of my eyes! Please! Come with us! This is revenge for our men you killed! You enjoy it! The crows will pick your bones clean! They'll pluck out your eyeballs! Another skeleton in this crow's den. - Father! Father! - Okay, okay Magobei is coming... the mine or the hut. Maybe the mine is safer for her. Saburota, take Oteru to the mine. Well Oteru, let's go! Oteru! Oteru, come! Otatsu, what happened to that woman who mixed in with us? She is at the hut. Better be aware of her. She's already escaped from the cage... Father! Saburota, long time, no see. Where is Jinroku? Damn it! Saburota! Tell me! Where is Jinroku? Where is he? If you tell me, I won't kill you. My father is at the hut! Father! Did Magobei talk about the gold? Nobody else knows about it! He just told me. - Since you found about the gold, you can't leave the mountain. Well, if you join us, then it's different. Listen, Oren-san, don't you want to live longer? Boss, I will be who ever you want me to be. By the way, I'm getting tired. Ichirota, take 2~3 men with you and go to the mountain! Maybe Magobei is going that way... Will you be okay here? If he comes this way, I am going to chop him up! Oren, I will do that right in front of you. Dear, don't you think that you better kill this vixen first? - Shut up! Go to the mountain with Ichirota! - Dear... - Get going! Listen, you men go to the mountain! Jirota, hurry up! You go to the back! Boss, can you do this? She's your wife, isn't she? Yeah, but she is just a dog, I can make her disappear any time. You'll make her disappear? - That's right! She knows all about the gold mine, I can't let her leave alive. Tell me about the secret gold mine too? The government stopped digging the mine a long time ago, but afterwards I found a different mine in the North of the mountain... and that one is all mine! How about it? Come to me. No! I knew this would happen. You sneaky female fox! Bitch! - Stop it! Let me go! Mago-san! Mago-san! Please wait for me! Mago-san! I fell in love with you! You made me fall in love with you but you're trying to leave me... you cold-hearted bastard! Oteru! Oteru! Oteru, it's me! It's me! Oteru! This! Oteru! Oteru, over there! Oteru, hurry up! Oteru, hurry! Oteru, quickly! Hey Kiba, this must be our fate to meet each other at weird places. I'm an honest man, so I'll give back what I owe you. Hey, isn't she Higasa's crazy daughter? What is going on? How do you know her? Oteru, it's okay! Come down here! This is not a good place to stay. If you don't want to be my partner, leave the mountain as soon as possible. Wait! - What is it? I want to ask you one thing. Why did you kill Kihachi? He left me no choice. But! You are so nave. 'Fangs of a Wolf', you don't deserve your name. What good will pity do for me? Show pity on someone and they'll sneak up on you from behind. But I can't afford to die yet. Not until I destroy the Higasa family who betrayed me. I'm going to kill every one of them. It could be, I may have to kill this crazy daughter too. I love you! I love Father, too! I love you, too. Oteru. Am I pretty? Yes, you are pretty. You are very pretty. Oteru... Water please! Oteru... Oteru. You're a good girl. I don't blame you for being afraid of this watermill because you were abused in here, weren't you? I looked all over for you! Get out here! Oteru, go over there! It cannot be helped! Let's go. I feel sorry for you, an honorable man that, I will send to Heaven! Why? Oteru! I don't want to die! Father... I want to see my father... Your father? Do you want your father? Okay. I'll take you to him. Father! Bitch! If you want to kill me, do it quickly! I am Oni-Azami Oren I want to die a beautiful death. You know what'll happen to you, don't you? Damn you! Magobei, stop! If you move, this woman will end up in a bottomless pit! Mago-san! Mago-san, save me! I want to live! Don't leave me! I want to live! Help me! I want to live! I want to live! Oteru! Wait! I brought Oteru. Please take care of her injury! But in exchange, please let that woman go! Oteru, what happened to you? Magobei, it's not like you! Do you think that you can beat all these men? Jinroku, in exchange for returning Oteru, please postpone this fight until another time. Just you and Magobei! Don't shed anymore innocent blood. How about it? Mago-san... You always show up just in time. How about it? Let's fight some other day just the two of us! - Son of a bitch! - Wait! Alright! Please give me back Oteru! - Dear! - She's my daughter. Drop your sword and bring Oteru over here! I will take her there. Let go of your sword! It cannot be helped. Hey, let that woman go! Come here and I'll let her go. On my word as a man. Father! Father! Oteru! Magobei! Wait, Magobei! Father! Wait, Magobei! Oteru! Don't kill Oteru! Did you fall in love with this crazy woman? Magobei, don't kill Oteru! Oteru! Damn you! Go to Hell! Magobei. Why? Why did you kill Oteru? What did she do to you? Kiba, help me with this! There's a lot of gold buried here. - Magobei, why did you kill Oteru and Kihachi too? Shut up! How can we live if we worry about that? Hurry up and help me! No, I won't! Come on Magobei! Do you want to fight? I can't forgive you! Ronin like us, don't need sympathy... Don't you agree? This world is money! Money can buy everything! It can even buy people's hearts! So, wake up! I won't go easy on you because you're injured. It's how I fight! Kiba... one day... ...You'll be like me... Oteru!
