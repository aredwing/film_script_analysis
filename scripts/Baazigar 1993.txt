All right, my boy. I'll come rightaway. Doctor, what's happened to my mother? You don't have to worry. Come to the dispensary in the morning and take the medication from me. All right. Doctor, I hope the poor woman will recover. Nothing can be said for certain since she's not ailing from anything. In fact, she has suffered some great setback. You are right. May the Lord not let anybody suffer such a setback. Also remember that it's important for her to have enough of food. If she doesn't eat enough, medicines won't be effective. Mother... mother! Drink the medicine, Mother. Eat it, Mother. I know that you always eat after you have fed me. But I have already eaten. I'm telling you the truth. Please eat it... Don't cry, Mother. Why are you weeping? The one who has made us weep will have to shed tears. Mother! Look what's happened to the little girl! Hey! Aren't you ready yet? Come on, get ready quickly. I will serve breakfast. You see, till you don't eat, your mother won't eat either. I'll come rightaway, Aunty. Where's Ajay? Mother looks so pretty today. Come on, Mother. Let's have breakfast now. Aha! It's a sweet dish! Open your mouth, Mother. Now feed me with your own hands. Did you feed milk to the little girl? Yes, Mother. The little girl has drank the milk. And father has gone out to fetch the medicines. As soon as he returns with the medicines... ...we will give the medicine to the little girl. Do you know... the little girl has become very naughty! She doesn't obey anyone. Let's go. I should be leaving now, Mother. No, Ajay. You are a son who would make every mother proud. You have done so much for your Mother. You should be happy that your Mother has begun talking. Your efforts have borne fruit. You too care for her so much. You have done so much for us despite being a neighbour. Not even one's own relatives don't take so much trouble. That's enough. You appear to have become very wise, is it? I should be leaving. Stop please... stop! It's you? Yes. Where are you going? I was on my way to Bombay. But I missed the bus. Is it? I am also heading towards Bombay. Come in. We are meeting after many years. How are you? I am fine. How's your mother? Mother is absolutely fine. How about you? I went to Pune several times. But I couldn't meet you. I am living in Bombay now. In fact, I travel a lot between Bombay and Pune. Ever since my parents have died... ...I've had to take on the business responsibility. Your parents passed away? In the plane-crash two years ago at the Bangalore airport... ...all the passengers were killed. My parents were two of them. Tell me, why are you going to Bombay? In search of someone. Searching for whom? In search of success. Wait, fatso. I will pick up the phone. I am the head servant of this house. Understand? Why do you answer the phone? You are unable to remember anything. You speak however you like. And then I have to bear with the abuses of Mr. Chopra. Go away from here. Go and wash the utensils in the kitchen. I don't remember anything? How can he say that? I am Mr. Bajodia speaking from Ahmedabad... ...who deals in boxes, buckets and tumblers. Who are you? I am Babulal, the head servant of this household. You see, I've to come to Bombay to discuss about my son's marriage. You hand over the phone to Mr. Chopra. Just a minute. Fatso, who's Mr. Chopra here? Mr. Chopra is our employer. Just hold on. I will go and find him. If daddy telephones, tell him that... ...I will go straight to the health club from the college. All right? Yes. There's nobody around, and the phone has been kept off the instrument. If I am not around for a day, what would happen of this house? How are you, Sir? I am fine. I telephoned to ask you when I should come to see the girl. You may come whenever you like. Tell me, how's your business doing? Potatoes and onions have become just too expensive. Even the tomatoes, chillies and ginger too! Who's this speaking? I am Babulal, the headservant. What's wrong with you? You should've told me so. You're giving me a hard time. I want to speak to Mr. Chopra. Give me the telephone. Mr. Chopra has left for the college. Mr. Chopra still studies in the college? She's arrived! Here I go. O Lord Hanuman! If she looks in my direction lovingly... ...I would make an offering of half a coconut at your temple. Move away. Have you brought my history notes? Yes. And I have brought your love story which was kept inside it. Love story? Come over here. What's going on? I don't understand. I'll show you. Look! I can understand that it's your heart that has been targetted. But whose arrow is it which has wounded your heart? Not now. I will tell you at the right time. All right. Let's go to the canteen. You'll miss the pyscho lectures? I won't attend any class today. I will tell Ravi when he comes. He will take down the notes. Did you see? You remembered him and he came over to you. Is that all? I will copy all the notes of psychology... ...and hand it over to you. You need not attend the lecture. I knew that you are the only one in college whom I could depend upon. All right, then. I am leaving. Where did it go? What kind of a lover are you? You've returned after so many days. Today, you should have been waiting anxiously for your darling to arrive! Whereas you've your eyes fixed on this book! That's because books are better than darlings. At least they don't make you wait! Are you angry? Yes. I am very angry. Do you know that you've been late by six-and-a-half minutes? Please forgive me. No! No forgiveness. All right, then. Punish me. Your punishment is that till I continue to read the book... ...you should continue to kiss me ceaselessly. I mean... sit quietly till then. I don't like to meet secretly. I too don't like it too. But what can be done? We are helpless. You see, at this stage, nobody should know what's going on between us. If your daddy gets even an inkling that... ...you love an unemployed and ordinary boy like me... ...he would never forgive you, nor would he ever accept me. Don't feel sad. Trust me. The day is not far when you will become mine for ever. And then... But there's one thing... I don't like your habit of coming late. Let me see your watch. My sister was to have come today from Simla. I had to go to the airport too. It's too late now. She must've even reached home by now. How many of you are there, Babulal? I am only one, Sister Gabbar. I mean how many servants are there in this house? I will tell you rightaway. Three. And you? I am a man. You mean you are not a servant? Boss is always so concerned about me that... ...I forgot that I am a servant. You even forgot that the car had to be sent to the airport? Why does one have to send a car to the airport? There are airplanes at the airport, aren't there? Did you hear? Where's Daddy? He's passed away. What? He was travelling in a helicopter. He was feeling chilly. So he switched off the fan in the helicopter... ...and then he vanished from this world. Whom are you talking about? About my father. How are you? How are you?! I am fine. But I am very angry at you. Why didn't you come to receive me at the airport? I had extra classes today. All right. But at least daddy could have come! You know how daddy is. He is fond ofjust two things. One is to expand his business. And second is to race cars. He must be busy in one of these two activities. I don't want to hear anything. Our company's production should increase at all costs. Yes, Sir. Speak on, Mr. Mehta. The workers have appealed... ...to the management that they should be alloted houses to live. The company gives them employment for which they receive salaries. Besides this, they won't get anything else. You may leave now. Mr. Girdharilal's factory is in our control now. Go and take charge. Henceforth, this company will be known as Seema Garments. A lot of telephone calls have been received from your residence. Miss Priya has returned from Simla. How is my daughter? How are you? I am fine. But I am in a foul mood. Why is your mood foul? Why did you take so long? Because of urgent work at office. I have bought a new garment factory for Seema. Now Seema Garments' name will become a rage in the whole of Europe. And what about me? You? What do you want? That's all! A sports car? All right, you will get it. What is this? It's a soup. This is a soup? It's a finger bowl. One washes one's hands in it after eating the meals. What have you done? You've placed here something which is used after meals are over. What if the boss had gulped it down thinking it to be a soup? Quiet! Go and bring soup now! You may also go! You won't go anywhere tomorrow. You will stay with us. No! Instead, both of you will come with me to Madras. I'm going to participate in the car race for the final time. But how can I come? Why? I've my practical exams tomorrow. Oh yes! Your exams are important. But... It would've been great fun if you had come too. Why do you think so? Take it from me. Think of me to be close to you. Just see, father. Like always, you'll win the race this time too. I hear this is the last time you're participating in this race? Yes. Till I continue to participate, nobody else will be able to win. Till the number one doesn't make way, how will number two get the chance? That's fine. But it might happen that... ...number two gets the chance this time itself! There's a new boy named Vicky Malhotra. I've seen him practicing. His timing is amazing. He's the one with whom you'll have a stiff competition. Where's he? There he is! Whether it's a car race or a race in real-life... ...I don't lose ever. Yes! Whether it's a Icky, Micky, Licky or Chicky... ...they are all pale in comparison to my dad. What say, Dad? Mr. Madan Chopra is participating in the race for the last time. On one hand is Madan Chopra's experience... ...and on the other hand is Vicky Malhotra's confidence. Madan Chopra... his car is nearly close to him... Now Madan Chopra is attempting to overtake him... Vicky Malhotra's self-confidence is... Vicky Malhotra has suddenly increased his speed... With full control over his vehicle... ...Vicky Malhotra has overtaken Madan Chopra. Both, Vicky Malhotra and Madan Chopra take the leads alternately. Looks like Vicky Malhotra will set a new record... ...and Madan Chopra will have to concede defeat. I had nearly lost my breath! It was only when you raced ahead at the last minute that... ...number 32 was left wondering about who he is dealing with. I want to meet the driver of car number 32. Was there some technical problem in your car? No, Sir. Then how did you lose? I've been your fan since years. I look upon you as my guru. I didn't want you to lose the last race of your life. It means you lost deliberately? One has to lose something to win something. What do you want to win? Your blessings. I like your style. By the way, where you do hail from? From Bombay. Car racing is my hobby. And it's my profession to deal in racing cars. I've been on the look-out for a sports car for my daughter. Let me know if there's some nice car. I am reaching Bombay day-after-tomorrow. I will show her a car the moment I reach there. I want to click your picture next to your car. Just a minute. I'll join you. I'll be in the club-house, daughter. Excuse me... My name is... Priya Chopra. And you want to know why I lost the race! For your sake. Didn't you say that all these Icky, Micky, Licky or Chicky... ...will prove to be pale in comparison to your dad? And if this Icky, Micky, Licky or Chicky were to win the race... ...you would have been heartbroken. And how could I break the heart of a beautiful girl like you? That's why I said that to win sometimes, one has to lose too. And one who wins after losing is known as 'Baazigar'(a juggler). What is such a person known as? A 'Baazigar'. I It It' It's It's a It's a R It's a Ro It's a Roh It's a Rohi It's a Rohit It's a Rohit R It's a Rohit Re It's a Rohit Rel It's a Rohit Rele It's a Rohit Relea It's a Rohit Releas It's a Rohit Release It's a Rohit Release - It's a Rohit Release - w It's a Rohit Release - ww It's a Rohit Release - www Look! Your dress has become so wet! You're talking of my dress. But I've become so restless. Why? What's happened to you? Don't ask me anything. You may assume that I've lost for the first time. It was daddy who took part in the race. Then who defeated you? The one who was defeated by daddy. Whom did daddy defeat? The one who won me over. And who won you over? The one who lost with daddy though he was on the verge of winning. Gosh! Did daddy win the race or lose the race? Daddy won the race though he was on the verge of losing. But I lost. You're talking in such a confused manner. Why don't you tell me clearly what exactly happened? It was a scintillating competition. His gaze was like an arrow which straight hit my heart... ...and I was wounded. Whom are you talking about? What's happened to you? I've fallen in love. Gosh! You've fallen in love? Yes. And if you look at him, you will fall from the 20th floor. I'm prepared to jump from the 20th floor. But let me have a glimpse of him. Notjust a glimplse... I will even introduce you to him. He's coming tomorrow to show me a sports car. I will bring him to your college. All right. But bring him early. Tomorrow, I've to attend a friend's birthday party too. Daddy will become mad when he sees this car. I have also turned mad. If you like this car so much, why're you giving it to daddy? Who's talking of the car? Is this the age to love cars? This age is meant to fall in love with beautiful girls. Seema will be glad to meet you today. We have to meet her at college at one o'clock. I've praised about you to her so much that... ...she just went berserk. I've told her that... ...you're very handsome and that you love in a unique style. How many cylinders does this car have? Eight. It must be great fun to drive it, isn't it? Yes, it is. Shall I drive it? No, you can never drive it. Stop the car. What happened? What happened? So much noise for an ice-cream? Please fetch me one. Ice-cream is not available here. In that case, I want coconut-water. All right. I will fetch it for you rightaway. Please give me one ice-cream. I mean... coconut-water. Hurry up. I am going on a long drive. Yes, I am bringing it. There's a girl behind! Don't let her overtake. Why did you block my way? Come on! Move aside. You were driving the car so excitedly, weren't you? Does the road belong to your ancestors? Her speech is very spicy. Let's see how she tastes. Where are you running away? Let's catch her! How did you fall down? What happened? Did the girl hit you? Not the girl... that boy in the jacket hit me! What're we waiting for? Let's get him. The water is finished. Is it? What do you want now? The cream. As you wish! The cream! Yes. There they are! Come on! How come you're in this condition? Why don't you take something? Sometimes you jump from there, or from here, or from up above... Looks like you've come from some circus. Look... this is a place for love. You've come to love. And we have come to take out your procession. I see... so you play musical instruments! Yes... no, of course, not! Why didn't you tell me earlier? Darling... these people enjoy playing music. Why don't you sit here for a while... ...and let me take care of them? Where did he go? Why don't you come too? Take this file to the court. Can I make a phone call to Commissioner Uncle? Are you the Commissioner's niece? Let me make a phone call first. Then you will get to know. You've made the Commissioner your Uncle to impress a constable? It's you, Karan! You look smart in the uniform! This is Karan. We studied together in Simla. I was going and these crooks... I've understood. They must've surely teased you. I'll deal with them later. Please come in. Some other time. As it is, we've been delayed. You'd better hurry up. Seema must be waiting for us in the college. It's 3 o'clock already. She was to have to gone to her friend's party. She must've gone by now. Come on... open your mouth. A little bigger. Just a little more... I cannot come. I cannot leave them and come to you. Why don't you call him inside? Whom should I call in? The one whom you are signalling to. I was only calling Charlie to dance with me. He got the connection with great difficulty. I am coming over. Tell me something. Why didn't you come inside the party? You know that I don't like to mix with your affluent friends. I came upto the door only to inform you that... ...I'm going home for a few days. What? What will I do all the while you are away? Oh yes! Yes! You make do with that Charlie! Why're you angry? I was only joking. Come on... let's go and treat ourselves to some delicacies. I'm warning you strictly. The boy who was supposed to have come to see Miss Seema... ...he has already arrived. But you lowly people shouldn't come in his presence. Besides the Chopra house, even my image will be ruined. Understand? And today, I will be making a special tea. Special tea for special occasions. After drinking it, the boy will give his consent for marriage immediately. And it will be me who will make that tea. Has your father ever made tea? Don't mention my father. He used to make coffee. Get me the hat. Today, I will make tea flavoured with saffron. It's not saffron. It is turmeric. You are in a great hurry. Shut up, fatso! He's making a mess of things here. Over there, the guests are waiting for the tea to be served. You see... I've only one son. Whatever I have belongs to him. I've three factories. I make all kinds of plastic items. If you ever need buckets, mugs or tumblers for bathing... ...let me know immediately. Wait, Babulal. Shut up! And none of you should come outside. Understand? He has taken boiled water to be served. He didn't even mix tea leaves. Instead, he has mixed salt. He's my son. He's my only son. Mr. Singhania has telephoned. Please drink tea. I'll be back. Please go. Business comes first. If Mr. Singhania needs buckets or tumblers... ...do suggest my name to him. Make tea quickly. My son has studied in the United States. If you wish, you may speak to him in English and assure yourself. My son! My son! What is it? There are no tea leaves in it. Affluent people make such tea. Drink it quickly. Tea leaves! Tea leaves! Please come. Did you drink tea or not? The tea of your home is like nectar. What say, Son? Seema has come! Come, let me give you a surprise. What surprise? Come along first. Come, Seema. She's Seema, my daughter. And he's Mr. Bajoria, and this is his son. Hello, daughter. Both of them make a good pair. Now just give your nod for marriage. All right. Let's hold the engagement ceremony sometime next week. Try to understand my problem. You know, don't you, that I don't have any status or position... ...that I can come over to your dad and speak about marriage with him. I don't know anything. If you can't, I will speak with him. I will tell him everything about you and convince him. But... We have just one week left. Daddy has fixed my engagement for next week. All right. Meet me tomorrow. I will find some way out. You may marry wherever your Daddy wants you to. What are you saying? I've given it a lot of thought. We've no other way. I don't want any way. I want the destination. And you are my destination. I cannot live without you. In that case, we have just one choice left... ...which can unite us forever. What's that? Suicide. Suicide? Are you willing? If death is the destination of our love... ...then I am prepared to die gladly. I, Ajay Sharma, am writing this in full consciousness... I, Seema Chopra, am writing this in full consciousness... ...that without any coercion, having been fed up of life... ...that without any coercion, having been fed up of life... ...I am committing suicide. ...I am committing suicide. Nobody is to be blamed for this. Nobody is to be blamed for this. Sign it now. What happened? Why are you laughing? Because you've passed. Yes! I was only testing you! I was testing your love, your faith. What about this suicide note? Only cowards commit suicide. And I am not a coward so as to give up so easily. We will get married in the court tomorrow itself. You reach at the Registrar's Office at 1 o'clock sharp. I will wait for you there. Are you happy now? Closed between 1 and 2 p.m. See? You were delayed and it is lunch time now. How would I have known that... ...everybody in this office feels hungry between 1 and 2 p. M? What should we do for half an hour now? What if somebody sees us here? What can we do? Let them eat food. We will go for a walk somewhere. Gosh! People appear like tiny ants from up here! Our marriage is so strange! Neither is there any procession, nor any celebrations. Listen... tell me something. What is the gift that a husband gives... ...to his wife the first thing after the wedding? What is that? I knew that you would forget. That's why I've brought it. Look what's inside it. It's very beautiful. Just like you. Is it? Do you know, Seema? I feel like placing you on the top of the skies. Like this! Hey! What are you doing? I suffer from vertigo. I feel dizzy to look down from heights. Please take me down. I am feeling scared. Now that you've held my hand, why do you have to feel scared? I'm mad that I am taking you away from your world. Every girl has to start a new life after leaving her own world. And the girl walks on these beautiful feet... ...and liberates herself from her old ties for ever. I am freeing you. Please forgive me. Leave me. Leave me. Please leave me. Leave me. I am sorry about Seema's death. Can you spare some time in private? Yes, please come. Till now we believed that Seema fell from that building... ...or she was pushed down. But the truth is that... ...she committed suicide. Seema committed suicide? How can it be? Do you recognise this handwriting? This is written by Seema. But how can it be? On that day, she was so happy! And if she had any grief, she would've surely told me. I am her sister. I know her well. Seema cannot do this. Seema can never commit suicide. Seema cannot do like this. Seema cannot do it. I think there's no scope for any doubt. If you wish, we will continue the enquiry. Otherwise, we will close the case. You may do as you please. I've already lost my daughter. Why doesn't it enter inside? Keep on trying. It will go. This nail doesn't belong to this wall. It belongs on that wall. What is it? Is there someone at home? What a question! You blind man! Just put this on! Who am I here? Who are you? I am Prem Nath. So shall I start dancing then? We've stopped giving charity. Get lost from here. I wonder where from these people come from. Why're you screaming? What happened? I wonder where from they come to ask for charity. I threw him out of the house. You did a wise thing. Greetings. I've come from Bhimchand Jewellers. Is Miss Seema here? Tell me, what is it? I am her sister. She had come to our shop a few days ago. She has to pay for some bills. What for? She had bought a mangalsutra necklace. A Mangalsutra? Yes. Looks like you're mistaken. But she had given the address of this place. Look, this is the bill. What? I was telling you... ...before itself that Seema didn't commit suicide. Looks like the boy she wanted to marry has murdered her. Please request the Commissioner and start the enquiry again. No... there's no need for an enquiry. If Seema has been murdered... ...would you let go the killer without him being punished? The killer would be punished much later. Have you ever considered what punishment we would go through? It's such a shameful thing that Madan Chopra's daughter... ...used to love someone secretly... ...that she was planning to marry someone secretly. If this story is published in the press... ...if everybody talks about it in a juicy manner... ...I would lose my face. Who would marry you? Have you ever given it a thought? No... Seema is dead. Let the pain of Seema's death remain in your heart. We cannot let it spoil our reputation. No, I won't come up. I feel scared. What's there to be scared of? It's just six feet high. No. I feel dizzy when I look down from heights. What's the matter? Why did you call me here? Seema didn't commit suicide. How can you be so sure... ...though you've seen her handwritten suicide note yourself? Because she had purchased a mangalsutra necklace. Yes. And a day later, Seema fell down from here. And there's a marriage bureau in this building. It's possible that she must've come here to marry some boy... ...and that boy proved to be a cheat and he pushed her. Let's assume that the boy pushed Seema. But the question is... why did Seema want to marry him secretly? Secondly... One needs to apply one month in advance for a registered marriage. I've already checked the register. There's no application in the name of Seema Chopra at the marriage bureau. And thirdly, we didn't find any mangalsutra in Seema's purse. Now you tell me, did she come here to marry, or to commit suicide? If she wanted to commit suicide, she could've shot herself... ...or consumed poison. But she could never have jumped from a height. Because Seema was scared of heights. She used to feel dizzy when she saw from a height. She couldn't even jump from a height of six feet in a swimming pool. The enquiry is over. I cannot help you in any way now. Help me to track down Seema's killer. Nobody is helping me at this point of time. All right. I cannot do anything officially. But I am prepared to help you in my personal capacity. Now do as I say. You'll have to first ascertain who all Seema met. I had even asked Seema about the boy who she was in love with. But she put off the question saying... ...that she would tell me at the right time. But there is surely someone who she was in love with... ...whom she wanted to marry. Do you suspect any one who could have been her boyfriend? I don't know about outside the college. But within the college, she was friendly with Ravi. Who's Ravi? He's our classmate. Can you tell me where I can find Ravi? You will find him at the library in the evening. You are suspecting me needlessly. I did love Seema. And I also believed that she loved me too. But my misunderstanding was cleared the day when I saw her... ...in some other boy's company in the garden. Other boy? Who was he? I don't know him. Yes, I had clicked some photographs on Anjali's birthday party. He is there in one of the pictures. Where is that photo? In my hostel. I will get it for you tomorrow. No! I want that photograph now. You stay here. I will go upstairs and get the photographs. I will come too. No! This is a boy's hostel. So you can't come upstairs. Come on. Sign it. Sign it. Hold it. Sign it. Come on! Put your signature! Excuse me. Which is Ravi Shukla's room? Ravi had come to show me the picture of Seema's lover. Then why did he commit suicide? He had lied. He didn't have any such picture. Ravi has confessed in his suicide note that... ...he was Seema's lover, and his killer too. And when you came here with him, he got scared of being caught. And thus he committed suicide. Your suspicion proved right. Seema's lover was, in fact, her killer. Forgive me, Seema. Alongwith your life, today I've even wiped out every evidence... ...connected with your death. Because I'd no other alternative. I betrayed your love because I wanted to win your father's confidence. And the goal of my life is to destroy him. And to achieve my goal, alongwith your death... ...Ajay too will have to die today. Please forgive me. Yes, Madan Chopra! My double life ends from today. I couldn't win your trust as Ajay Sharma... ...but I won that trust by posing as Vicky Malhotra... ...in the race track in a matter of one meeting. Now get ready. It's time for your downfall. Fatso! It has been six months since Miss Seema passed away. But Babulal's spying is on the increase. Notjust us, but he has been suspecting Mr. Chopra too. One doesn't come across good people like Babulal. What's this? What is it? You drink liquor? You gave it to me at night after you'd drunk some of it. Keep it away. Where are we going? To the office. Daddy wants to discuss something important with you. What is so urgent? How would I know? We would know only when we reach there. All right... yes, I will get it done. Come in. All right. Let me think over. I want to discuss something personal with you. Yes? Your association with me began on the race course. On that day, you lost the race for my sake though you could've won. I didn't make you my disciple. But you considered me your guru. Thereafter Seema died. I managed to somehow bear it. But you helped Priya in losing the grief of losing her sister. You became more friendly with Priya... ...and forced her to become restless waiting for you. Gradually, you overwhelmed our lives. I've understood your every move. I've got to know why you did all this. Because you and Priya love each other. And I don't want to become an obstacle in your relationship. So call your parents immediately so that... ...I can get both of you engaged with great fanfare. In the plane-crash two years ago at the Bangalore airport... ...all the passengers were killed. My parents were two of them. But my parents are no more alive. What? In the plane-crash three years ago at the Bangalore airport... ...all the passengers were killed. My parents were two of them. Henceforth, I won't let you feel the absence of your parents. Come on, Son. Sit on this chair... ...and become my equal partner in handling the Chopra Empire. Go and celebrate now. No, Sir. Today is an important day for me. I want to start work today itself. Bravo! Let's go. Come home early in the evening. Sir... Sir, please forgive me. I've been punished for my misdeeds. Three years behind bars have ruined my family. My wife died. The children have been deprived of their mother. I've been ruined. Have mercy on me. Let me live at your feet. Where will I go with my kids? Where will I roam about? That's your lookout, not mine. I had always desired your well-being. I never treated you like a stranger. I treated you like my own brother. And what did I get in return? Deceit? Excuse me... what is he doing here? Please forgive me. I am ashamed of my mistakes. Please have mercy on me. I take an oath in the name of my elder daughter Seema... I will never make any such mistake again. Please forgive me. Please forgive him. To err is human, after all. But... You see... Nobody would take false oaths in the name of his own progeny. Moreover, his tears indicate that he has reformed. I believe him. All right. I will agree if you say so. Madam... Why do you have to do this? Send those consignments to UGC Chemicals... He's Mr. Madan, our old employee. From today, he will work with you. Come, Madan. Be seated, Madan. Yes. Not there. Sit on the chair. Yes... But the government doesn't approve of such projects. It's my lookout to make the impossible possible. Do as I say. And get Mr. Sharma's signatures on this form. You've indeed made a very good plan. Our company will stand to gain crores of rupees. I've always admired your hard work and intelligence. That's why I have decided that... ...henceforth you are a five per cent partner in this company. Five per cent! The Company directors are waiting for you in the conference room. Five per cent! Fool! I've come here to become a hundred per cent owner and kick you out. Keep this suitcase in the car and come back soon. Yes, I am going to Assam. I've bought a tea garden there. It might take me many months to return. The plantations might need a lot of time. What about the business over here? Don't worry about it. Madan will take care. I have checked the files of the orders. Take good care of our permanent dealers. Don't let them have any reason for complaint. Yes, Sir. This is a power of attorney in your name. In my name? Yes. This will enable you to operate the company with ease. Come on, Father. It's getting late. Yes, let's go. You've given me notjust a power attorney... ...but the land on which the wheels of Madan Chopra's chair'll rest now. Chopra Industries takes legal control over Sharma Group Of Companies. You thankless person! You cheated me despite being under my shelter? I offered you support out of pity for your children... ...and you ruined me? You forgot my obligations and my sympathies? Which sympathy are you talking about? Three years ago... ...I had misappropriated just five lakh rupees from your company. Just five lakhs... If you wished, you could have pardoned me. But you had me sent to jail. At that very moment, I had pledged that I would destroy you. That I would snatch away everything from you. You were fortunate that you gave me the power of attorney by yourself. Otherwise, for this wealth, I could've murdered you too. Go away from here. And never dare to return here. After we finish with our activity... ...please appoint policemen at this bungalow... ...so that nobody touches anything till the auction is over. What's the matter, Son? They've thrown us out of our house. What's all this happening? To recover the loan that you'd taken from the bank, we've been ordered... ...to seal all your properties and bank accounts in Bombay and Assam. But I never took any loan! The bank documents in our... ...possession clearly state that through Mr. Madan Chopra... ...you have borrowed 5 crore rupees on interest. The court had sent a notice to your home 15 days ago. Since there was no action from your end... ...the court had to take this step. But my wife and children will become homeless! I cannot do anything. If Mr. Chopra wants, he can help you. Hey! What's this? You are weeping? No, no! Tears will make the colour of your cheeks lifeless. You want a house, don't you? I will give you one. The royal nawabs and emperors have made mansions for their keeps. Can I not give you at least a flat? I can realise how difficult it would be for a beautiful woman like you... ...to sleep on the roads. And where would you take your bath... How could you dare to touch me? I am not a whore from a brothel. I am the wife of Vishwanath Sharma. Ravana and Dushashana too were ruined because of their misdeeds. What are you in comparison to them? What's your status? Just remember... you can never become happy in your lifetime. The curses of my children will deprive you of your peace of mind. You will be ruined. You will be ruined. It's the curse of a mother. Your curse cannot harm me in any way now. Now everything belongs to me. And I own everything now. Please pack this one too. How are you? I am fine. But where were you? I had been to your hostel, but I learnt that you don't stay there. I've received a receptionist's job at Hotel Hilltop. I live there. Why? Is there anything special? I wanted to invite you for my engagement. When is it? This evening. And you should come. It's difficult today. It's my night duty today. If I had known earlier, I would've taken leave. Shall we leave? This is Seema's best friend. And he's my fiance, Mr. Vicky Malhotra. Seems like I've seen you earlier. You must've surely seen me. It's a small world, after all. Let's go, Priya. You've to reach the beauty parlour. Congratulations to both of you in advance. Seems like I've seen you earlier. You must've surely seen me. It's a small world, after all. Please come in. A sweet drink for you, Madam. Fatso! Look over there! Babulal has forgotten to pour the sweet drink... ...in the glasses, and he's moving around with empty glasses. Mr. Batra! My name is Wadhawa! Please have some sweet drink. It's really delicious. No? No! Greetings. Have all of your friends arrived, or are there still some more left? Many congratulations to you. Friends, Mr. Chopra's daughter, Priya, is being engaged to Vicky Malhotra. And on this joyous occasion... ...India's renowned singer, Vinod Rathod will render a beautiful song. Is this Chopra's house? Then is it a telephone exchange? Please call Priya on the line. I want to speak to her urgently. For a girl, nothing is more important than her engagement. She's very busy. She can't come. I've got the connection with great difficulty. I want to tell her something about Seema. You want to tell about Seema? Yes. Tell Priya that Anjali has telephoned and she wants... ...to say something important about Seema. Just a minute. I will forget. It's Anjali's phone, and she wants to say something important about Seema. Anjali is on the line. She wants to say something important about Seema. Anjali is on the line. She wants to say something important about Seema. Anjali is on the line. She wants to say something important about Seema. What are you saying? Anjali is on the line. She wants to say something important about Seema. It's all right. Bring ice-cream for me. Come on. I will forget the message. Didn't I tell you to fetch ice-cream? It's Anjali's phone. I won't bring any ice-cream. Just a minute. Madam, there's a telephone call. Anarkali had telephoned. It's important to eat ice-cream. What? Anarkali had telephoned. It's important to eat ice-cream. Anarkali's phone... What's the matter? Anarkali had telephoned. It's important to eat ice-cream. What? What nonsense? Have you consumed liquor? Go away from here. This old man never lets me do any important work. Surely there's something wrong. Sometimes I even suspect him. Who are you speaking? I am Chopra speaking. Priya's daddy. Greetings, Uncle. I am Seema's friend, Anjali, speaking. Yes, tell me, daughter. I had met Priya at the shopping center today. She introduced me to Vicky there. Vicky's face resembles that of the boy who was Seema's friend. How can you be so sure? I've his picture. A picture? Yes. He is there in the pictures clicked in my birthday party. Have you spoken about this to anybody else? No. I thought it necessary to inform Priya first. You did a very wise thing. Daughter, don't you mention about this to anybody. It's a matter of our family's honour. I hope you understand what I mean. By the way, where are you speaking from? All right. Stay there. I will come along with Priya. Can I use your telephone? It's you? I've come to trouble you a bit. Please be seated. Have you seen her before? She is Anjali, Seema's friend. I met her two days ago. Did you speak to Anjali on the night of your engagement? No. But what's the matter? Anjali is missing since that day. Missing? Upon enquiring at the hotel... ...I learned that she had telephoned here at around 10.30 p.m. I was busy in the party. On the night of the engagement party... ...did any girl called Anjali telephone? Tell me something. Whose engagement was it? It was my engagement! Ah yes! It was great fun! Remember carefully and tell me. Did a girl called Anjali telephone? If you get to know anything, do telephone me. I am leaving. What brings you here? He's come to enquire about Anjali. Anjali who? Seema's friend... ...whom we met at the jeweller's shop that day! Seema's friend?! I remembered! I remembered! I had received Anjali's telephone. She had asked me to call Priya. She wanted to tell you something about Seema. About Seema? Then why didn't you call me? I was on my way to call you. But somebody stopped me. Who stopped you? Give me two days time. I will remember and tell you. How can you be taken in by a forgetful person like him? It's foolish to believe him. Come on... go away from here. Sometimes I even suspect this Vicky. I am leaving. How many times should I call your name? When I had come in the drawing room on the night of the engagement... ...you were speaking to someone over the telephone. What do you mean to say? On that day, it was Mr. Madan Chopra's daughter who was engaged. Not some Tom, Dick and Harry. There had been several congratulatory calls. I didn't know that you will be enquiring. Otherwise, I would've made a list of all the calls. I was just making a normal enquiry. But I am sorry for the inconvenience. It's possible that... ...Anjali must've wanted to reveal something about Seema's death! It has been one year since Seema's death. Even her killer has committed suicide. But it's possible that... Nothing is possible. You don't know these policemen. For their livelihood, these people dig old graves. I was so happy that... ...our love wiped away the grief of Seema's death from your heart. But this scoundrel has revived your wounds once again. I want to discuss something important with you. Come over to my office immediately. Come soon. I've to leave for the airport within 5 minutes. Yes. I will come rightaway. One gives such power of attorneys to people whom you can trust fully. What's the question of trust? Moreover, Vicky is not an outsider. He's my future son-in-law. All right, then. I should be leaving. It's time for your flight. Ah yes! Why hasn't Vicky come in yet? Where did Vicky go? You are here? I've been searching you since so long! I didn't hear your voice. Come along. After a conference in London, I'll have to go to Germany. It will take me a lot of time. So I've made this power of attorney in your name. With this, you can take any decision on behalf of the company. It's time for you to leave. Ah yes! Let's go. I was waiting for this very day. You've given me notjust the power of attorney... ...but the blank paper of your destiny... ...on which I can write the history of your downfall as and when I like. You are misusing the power of attorney. You had better restrict yourself to your duties. I know better what is right and what is wrong. But sir... About the growing incidence of violence... ...the Police Commissioner of Bombay told reporters that... ...the police patrol has been increased in affected areas... ...and the constables are being equipped with rifles. In one more incident, according to the police reports... ...the corpse that was found in a huge suitcase at Chowpatty... ...was that of a female employee of Hilltop Hotel. It's believed that the girl was aged about 20 years... ...and her name was Anjali Sinha. I am Priya speaking. I just saw on TV that Anjali's corpse has been found on the beach! I know about it. And I was coming to your home to discuss this matter. No, don't come here. I don't want Vicky or father to know about it. Then where should we meet? Meet me at the coffee shop at Hotel Sun-N-Sand rightaway. What's the matter? You appear to be very perturbed. Whose phone was it? It was one of my girlfriend's phone. I am going to her home to meet her. Come, I will drop you there. It doesn't matter. I will go on my own. I will go and change. Till now, we believed that Ravi was Seema's killer. But after Anjali's death, it seems the killer is somebody else... ...and he killed both Ravi and Anjali. But Ravi had himself written in his suicide note that... ...he himself is the lover as well as the killer. The killer is very clever. He used the same weapon to kill both Ravi and Anjali. Whoever tried to give information about Seema got killed. Ravi wanted to show you the picture of Seema's killer. And according to Babulal, Anjali too wanted to say something about Seema. But then, who could the killer be? Whoever he is... ...he indeed keeps track of every detail about you. Anyhow, no matter how clever he is, he will be caught some day. Where did you go? I have been waiting for you since quite some time. Didn't I tell you that I went to meet my friend? What's the name of your friend? What's wrong even if I had gone to meet Karan? There's nothing wrong in meeting him. The wrong lies in meeting him secretly. What's the matter? Why do you go to meet him repeatedly? Sometimes at the police station, sometimes at the coffee shop... ...sometimes at his home. If you're so fond of meeting him, why don't you meet him in my presence? You suspect me? You want to know why I meet Karan secretly? It's because of you and Daddy. Whenever I tried to discuss about Seema's killer... ...you never lent me any support. And neither did Daddy did! Left with no alternative, I had to ask Karan for help. And it is because of him I've learnt that... ...my sister's killer is still alive. How could you think of such a cheap thing about Karan and me? You should be ashamed of yourself! I could've never imagined it. The cause of my fury, my envy and my suspicion is my love. I love you intensely. So much so that even if someone holds his gaze at you, I feel enraged. And today, for a moment, I got scared of having to lose you. That's why I don't know what all I told you! You are not only my love, but my obsession too. I cannot live without you. Never doubt your love again. I am yours. Only yours. Then come... let's dedicate this evening in the name of our love. Hey! That's my friend Ajay! Thank God at least you smiled! I will be back. Let's go somewhere else. Let's eat dinner at least. No, we will eat dinner elsewhere. It was great fun! You danced so well! Perhaps you've boozed a lot! My name is not Ajay! Why're you joking? I'm not so drunk so as to forget my childhood friend. You're a strange person. Didn't I tell you that my name is not Ajay? Nor am I your friend. Let's go, Priya. You're behaving haughtily because you've a girl with you? You're mistaken. His name is not Ajay. His name is Vicky Malhotra. Vicky Malhotra is my name, not his. He is lying. What's this drama? Why're you using my name? Hey! What're you doing? Leave him! How can you raise your hand on your friend? What do you think of yourself? How would you know what friendship is all about? What do you think of yourself? You use my name to trap a girl? I am Vicky Malhotra! He's my childhood friend. I've obliged him so many times! He has forgotten all about it. I don't want your friendship. How can he pretend to be a friend? My parents are no more alive. In the plane-crash three years ago at the Bangalore airport... ...all the passengers were killed. My parents were two of them. Vicky Malhotra is my name, not his. He is lying. This is not the time to think, but to take a decision. You had come here to destroy Chopra's family. Priya's love was merely a coincidence. Whenever you attempted to attain your goal... ...your love for Priya prevented you from doing so. But the day she will know the truth, she will hate you. Your goal is only to destroy Chopra. What's all this? Mr. Vicky has taken possesion of all the Companies. What? Thankless person! Cheat! You usurped my earnings of a lifetime. Who's this Sharma to whom you sold my empire? You've thrown me out on the streets! But you don't know who you've betrayed. My name is Madan Chopra. Birds talk about flying. Feathers which have been cut off don't! Don't scream! Remember that race course! You didn't consider me your disciple. But I considered you my guru and let you win that round. Because that race trophy was not my goal. This was my goal. This chair. Time has come to a standstill at the same point. Everything that happened 15 years ago is repeating itself. Remember that noble person who embraced you... ...and whom you betrayed by stabbing him in the back. I am Ajay Sharma, the son of the same Vishwanath Sharma. Do you remember... That day you were seated here... ...and my mother was standing there and begging for her own wealth. This is the same chair... After sitting on this chair... ...you caused the death of my father and sister... ...and a state of shock for my mother... ...and a life full of struggle for me. But today, I've stamped each of your belongings with my father's name. And though you want to, you can cause me no harm. Because this time around... ...your condition is like the handicapped person... ...who needs a crutch to walk, but he has no hands to hold it. And yes... henceforth... ...don't dare to come to my office without appointment. In the Bangalore air-crash three years ago... ...there were one Mr. And Mrs. K. L. Malhotra. Can I get their address? Just a minute. Their address is... Please come. I know you've come here to know who the real Vicky Malhotra is. I am the real Vicky Malhotra. And the one who was with you, his name is Ajay. The same Ajay who used to study with me at school during childhood. I helped him in all his problems. The same Ajay insulted me in the presence of others. I'm not bothered that he refused to recognise me. But I do feel hurt that he hit me... he hit his friend. This is how he repaid my obligations to him. I don't understand why he is calling himself Vicky Malhotra. How do you know him? He's my fiance. He's a liar. And if you still don't believe me, go and ask his mother... ...who still lives at Panvel in Sector 12. Chopra Industries takes legal control over Sharma Group Of Companies. What should I call you? Vicky Malhotra or Ajay Sharma? By changing your name and committing the crime... ...perhaps you forgot that changing one's name... ...doesn't change the person's face and his crime. You threw my sister from the rooftop so mercilessly... ...one doesn't even throw one's toy so mercilessly. Notjust this... you feigned love for me. Why? What harm did we cause to you? My father did so much for you. He shared all his happiness with you. And this is how you repaid us? If it was wealth that you wanted, you could've asked my father. He would've given it to you as alms. Alms? Which wealth are you talking about? The wealth on the strength of which... ...your father was ruling over Chopra empire... ...it belonged to my father. It belongs to me. Your respectable father who considers his daughter's death... ...as a blot on his reputation... ...I know where he has come up from. What did he possess? It was he who had come to our doorstep as a beggar. And my parents had given him support. In exchange, he robbed us of everything. He forced us onto the street. Imagine what that innocent child must've experienced... ...when your rascal father attempted to molest his mother? You don't know... ...the number of atrocities afflicted by your father on us. You've only seen the crown of affluence on his forehead. Try to pry into his sleeves. You will find the blood of my innocent father and sister. Even today I remember the night... ...when my family suffered the final blow of your father's atrocities. Mother... I hope sister will recover. Yes. Go and fetch cold water. All right, Mother. Has her fever come down? No, it's rising continously. All right. I will go and fetch medicines. Where are you going? Hasn't the doctor asked you to take rest? A person who is afflicted with so many problems... ...for him, even rest is an affliction. Listen... Look after her. Take this. If it were me who was sick instead of our daughter... ...I would've never removed it from my neck. No! No! Mother! Mother! Listen... what happened? Get up... get up. Look... Get up... get up. Just see... No! No! Mother! Mother! Look what's happened to sister! Even today, in my eyes... ...there's the funeral pyre of my father and my sister's grave... ...which are still wet with my tears. You've only been pricked with a thorn. A whole trident had been pierced into my heart! I was afflicted with three wounds. And they were such wounds that... ...I couldn't heal them till date. Do you want to see for yourself? Come... come with me. It has been 15 years... But her eyes still continue to shed tears. My entire childhood has passed devoid of love from her. She's my mother. I haven't forgotten it. But she remembers only at times that I am her son. I will be back. Move aside, Priya. He has ruined us. He's a cheat! You are lying. I've got to know who's the cheat! It's you who's the cheat, not him. Take her away from here. Leave me! Beat him! Do you think that you will be able to take my wealth easily? My name is Madan Chopra! Continue to beat him! I can realise how difficult it would be for a beautiful woman like you... ...to sleep on the roads. And where would you take your bath... Eliminate this rascal! Beat this scoundrel! Beat him severely! Leave him! Leave him! Let go my son! Leave him! How could you dare to touch my son? I've only shot at his arm as of now. But if he doesn't return me my property papers... ...I will make so many pieces of his body... ...that you will die picking it up. A mother picks the future and good wishes for his son... ...not the pieces of his body. If anything happens to my son, I'll make pieces of your body. Mother! Mother! How could this happen? No... mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Since 15 years, the blood... ...which had been flowing through my mother's eyes in the form of tears... ...you've broke upon its floodgates. There will be a flood now. You had hit my mother with this very hand, didn't you? Didn't you raise the same hand? Where's Ajay? Come out. Stop, Ajay! In the name of your mother... stop! I It It' It's It's a It's a R It's a Ro It's a Roh It's a Rohi It's a Rohit It's a Rohit R It's a Rohit Re It's a Rohit Rel It's a Rohit Rele It's a Rohit Relea It's a Rohit Releas It's a Rohit Release It's a Rohit Release - It's a Rohit Release - w It's a Rohit Release - ww It's a Rohit Release - www Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! What happened, Son? Mother... I've acquired what was my right. I wiped out the storm... ...which had made us helpless. You will have no trouble now. What can be more troublesome for a mother... ...in whose lap his son is lying wounded and she can't do a thing? Perhaps this was my destiny! Mother... Today... after many years... I am finding it very soothing in your lap. Mother... envelop me in your arms. Hide me in your embrace. Mother, I've been yearning for your love since childhood. I want to sleep peacefully now. I want to sleep peacefully... Yes, sleep... Sleep, my son... You've come in my lap after so many years.
