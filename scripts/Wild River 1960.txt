I grabber her, but slipped, and the little girl went. Shortly after that the little boy he went, and soon after that my wife, father-in-law and the baby, they went too. The three children that were lost, their ages, the oldest was six, and the middle one was four and the baby was three. They haven't found the baby and the oldest boy yet. The little girl we have and that's all. To stop the devastation, the waste, the loss of life caused by the Tennessee River at flood, the Congress of the United States, on May 18th 1933, created a vast new agency called The Tennessee Valley Authority, or TVA, and authorised it to build a series of dams along the river. At the same time, the Tennessee Valley authority had to buy all the land along the shore of the river and all its islands. Some people had lived on this land for generations. Some people refused to sell, under any persuasion whatsoever. Garthville. Hi, I'm Chuck Glover. I'm Betty Jackson. I was Mr. Biggs secretary. Do I inherit you, too? I don't know. Mr. Biggs left so suddenly he didn't say. You're inherited. What desk should I use? That was Mr. Biggs desk. Thank you. What's the matter? I thought they'd send an older man. No, they sent a younger one. Shall we get to work? I'll get the folder on Garth Island. Getting the old lady off Garth is difficult. You're the third one they've sent to try. Ella Garth versus Washington. Poor old Mr. Biggs was disgusted when he quit. I'll bet he was. Maybe, it could be he went about it the wrong way. That man did everything anybody could do. He begged and pleaded with her, but she won't budge an inch. That's the American way of life. Rugged individualism is our heritage. 3000 people sell, and Ella Garth won't sell. We applaud that spirit, we admire it, we believe in it, but we must get her out of there. The dam is finished and once they close those gates and the water starts to rise... Well, we've not only got to get her out of there, but we must get the land cleared, the houses and trees down... Be careful! I guess I'm not telling you anything new. Betty, how would you go about getting her off the island? I'd let her drown. That's one way. How many...? Is that the island? Everyone of them bought up except that one. How many Garth's live there? There's many, but that old women, she's it. They've been told the island will be flooded? About a million times. I guess I'll go out and talk to her. You do that. It's not that I think I can talk any better than the others, but I think we often underestimate the intelligence of people. We can talk to them and they'll listen. Well... Well, what? Let's see how you feel in a few days. I'm off to see the Mayor. He's in charge of clearing the land. Wish me luck. Have your cards and stamps in your hands. - I'm sorry I'm late. - We've been waiting, Mr. Davis. Could you tell me where I'd find the Mayor? In the barber shop. Is the Mayor still in there? Yeah, sure. Mayor Maynard? Be with you in just a minute. All right. The only way to get her off the island is to get a U.S. Marshal. Except, we can't use force. We're having trouble enough in Washington. Some Senators are solidly opposed to these dams. - Tom, how long are you going to be? - I'll cut your hair tomorrow. We've got to get those Garths off the island. Bottled it Friday. With no dispossess, no marshals, and no bad publicity in the papers. You'll never do it. I'll do it. I mean, I'll try to do it. There must be some way, don't you think? Stay where you are. There'll be 20 feet of water there. We're a little behind schedule, but we'll make it before the winter rains. Why don't you get more men? Can't. Unless we use coloured. Well? Use coloured and the whites would quit. For a minute there I forgot where I was. Here we are. There's the island. It looks deserted. It's not. They're there. They know you're here. I suppose that means me. T.V.A. KEEP OFF Nobody else. Well. Here I go. Good luck. After all what can they do to me? Just pull yourself over. And let me know how you come out. I will. Hi, men. - Who's that? - I don't know. Good afternoon. I'm from the TVA. And... I saw your sign, unfortunately I had to disregard it. I'd like to talk to you. Would you give me a few minutes? If I was you I'd go now. Would you give speak to me? I have a problem. We've just built this big dam down the river, and pretty soon this whole place will be water. Everywhere it's going to be water. That's wonderful. What's your name? Barbara Ann. I'm five years old. You're what? Five years old. You're not five. You're at least six. No, I'm only five. Barbara Ann! Yes, Mama? Barbara Ann, where are the men working? Barbara Ann, come in here. Yes, Mama. Uncle Hamilton and Uncle Cal are by the stream. You mean, you get catfish bigger than that? Some are bigger, some are smaller. Well... about what I came to discuss... Why don't you get out of here? We don't want any trouble. Trouble? You're from the Government, ain't you? Yes. Go on about your business. My business is with you. Ma said we wasn't to talk to you. You have to talk to me. We do? Look, you know as well as I know that you must leave here. TVA has offered you a fair price and a new place just as good. What have you got against a new place? Too much work. You work here, don't you? No, sir. Who does? You don't do any work at all? How do you manage that? Just never started. Ma owns this property and she ain't gonna sell it. Certainly I can understand how a senile old woman would be sentimental about a place and not want to leave. Perhaps, she doesn't understand what it's all about. Ma understands everything. If she understands, then what is she doing? These floods... Ma knows about the floods. Then I really don't understand! Now, you just quiet down. We ain't stupid. I didn't say you were. - Been reading your mind. - Mister, Ma ain't selling. It's up to you to make her sell. Are you all afraid of her? Joe John. Don't say nothing against Ma. What am I saying against her? I'm saying that if your mother is senile it's up to you to make her understand she has to leave. Ma ain't gonna. She is gonna. You know that. Joe John. Mister, you'd better go now. Not until I talk to your mother. Come on, take me up there. What's so funny? What's senile? Crazy. He says Ma is crazy? I never saw so many men afraid of one... What are you doing? Hey, hey. Let me go! Let go of me! - Wake up, Mr. Penner. - What time is it, Mrs. Riggs? October, and you haven't got a job yet. Want to buy a duck? I'll sell Goo-Goo cheap. I've been swimming. Hello, Glover? You sure got her off in a hurry. Now start getting the land cleared. What do you mean I got her off? What's holding you up? I've been here one half day. Yes. There's a possibility that Biggs was right, the only way to get her off may be by force. We can't use force. What? I'm sorry. I can't hear you. A couple of senators have got their teeth into us. They'll use any incident to destroy us. I know that. I'll call you in a couple of days. Right. Goodbye. You wanted to see me? Too bad about this afternoon. Old Joe John is unpredictable. What do you want? Ma says you got an apology coming to you. She's sorry about what happened. Cal and Joe John are sorry. Carol, she's sorry, too. And me, I'm all busted up about it. If you come tomorrow, Ma will talk to you. You better hang them up, they'll get crinkled down there. What time? Any time. We don't go no place. The say that President Roosevelt has a new government, you know. It's called the New Deal. What do you think of that? You know anything about Mr. Roosevelt, son? Yes ma'am. I tell you Mr. Roosevelt is gonna flood this island. Yes, sir. He's going to take the best land in these parts and put it right smack under the Tennessee river. You know these politicians, they gotta get the votes. Yes, they gotta get the votes somehow. So the President, he sits up there in that big White House, and says, "This country is just going to the dogs. " And the only way he can figure to do anything to stop it is to put my island under water. What do you think of that? I'm telling you this because our friend, in this end cabin here sneaked off last night. Yes, sir. He just slipped out with his family, in the middle of the night. I ain't blaming him. I ain't blaming him because nobody wants to be put under water permanent. But I'm telling you all right now, don't go sneaking off in the middle of the night. Any of you want to go? Any of you want to leave? The ferry is down there waiting for you just any time you want to go. Nobody keeping you here. Hi. You go off and join the government. I understand they're gonna put you on relief. Now you just go and get yourselves relieved any time you want. Me, I ain't going. Sam. Yes, Mrs. Ella? How's "Old Blue" running these days? He's all right, Mrs. Ella. I decided I gonna buy "Old Blue", Sam. What's that? You heard me, I said I want to buy "Old Blue". How much you want for him? I wouldn't want to sell "Old Blue". I didn't ask if you wanted to sell him. I say I'm gonna buy him. I gonna give you... I'll give you 15 dollars for him. What's the matter? He ain't worth more than that. No. He ain't worth nothing, but I ain't selling him. You gotta sell him because I'm going to buy him. How am I gonna buy him unless you sell him? I don't know, but I ain't gonna sell him. Sam Johnson, You is selling him. No I ain't gonna. "Old Blue" is mine and I ain't gonna sell him even to you. You ain't got no right to make me. That's true, Sam. And come to think of it, I don't have the right. You see, young man, Sam and me, we don't sell. Sam don't sell his dog and I don't sell my land that I've poured my heart's blood into. Joe John. Joe John is real sorry for what he done yesterday. Ain't you, son? That's all right, Joe John. Mrs. Garth, sometimes it happens we can't remain true to our beliefs without hurting many people, and I'm afraid this is one of those times. You're the only person who hasn't sold here. That's all right with me. Granma. Yes, Carol? What? Nothing. Young man, do you know anything at all about land? I believe so, that's why I was sent down here. When you go back to the ferry pick up a handful of soil. That's real bottom. Thousands of tonnes of it are being washed away every year. Mrs. Garth, you don't love the land. You love your land. You know the Tennessee River is a killer. Year after year it's taken many lives. Isn't it plain common sense to want to harness it? You know what that will mean? Today, 98 of the people in this valley have no electricity. The dam will bring them the electricity. I expect that's what you call progress, isn't it? No, sir. I don't. Taking away peoples souls, putting electricity in place of them ain't progress. Not the way I see it. We're not doing that. We're giving them a chance to have a soul. And it isn't just this dam. It's dam after dam after dam. We aim to tame this whole river. You do? I like things running wild. Like nature meant. There's already enough dams locking things up, taming them, making them go against their natural wants and needs. I'm against dams of any kind. You can get me off by force, I reckon. It won't take much force, but it will take some. That's the only way you'll ever get me off here, because I ain't going against nature and I ain't crawling for no damn government. Mrs. Garth, we don't want to put you off by force. What's going to happen to you? Me? I'll show you. If you come with me, I'll show you. Now, read it out. "Woodbridge Garth, born 1839, died 1889". Now that one. "Ella Garth, born 1853, died... " I stay right here in this land. The water would never come up this far, would it? Young man, my husband come down this river in a flat bottom boat when he was nothing but a boy. There wasn't even a road anywhere then. He was looking for an island. And he took this one. That near field there was all trees, you know. That one down there nothing but a damn swamp. He cleared it. He drained the fields, he cleaned the brush, he cut down them trees. He worked himself to death just to make these fields and he told me never to get off, and I ain't. I ain't. I'm getting a little tired. Goodbye. Why haven't you gotten her off? You know what's coming. Don't look to me. I was born here. I know what she's talking about. You've gotta believe it, if she has to leave, it'll kill her. People don't die as easy as that. There's some people like that. We'll get her a nice house with a radio, a modern kitchen. You don't know her. You love her, don't you? And you're afraid of her. Not really. I think if anyone has a chance of reaching her, it would be you. Was that your little girl? I have a little boy, too. One of those men isn't your husband? My uncles. Where's your husband? I'm sorry. How long have you lived here with here? Since my husband died. We lived on the other bank, in a white house. Did you see it? Yes, I did. Yeah. Well, when he died, I just locked the door and took my two babies and come over here to Granma. How old were you when he died? Nineteen. Nineteen? And you have two children. I plain gave up. But Granma doesn't believe in giving up. Yes, I kind of gathered that. She gave me her savings and sent me off to Jennings college to better myself. I tried it a whole year, but I just couldn't concentrate. So I came back. And I've been here ever since. Certainly you have a fellow somebody who cares. Yes, I've got a fellow. Well, then? What's that supposed to mean? If you do have a fellow... Yeah, a fellow solves everything. I gather you don't care too much about him. I'm going to marry him. But you don't love him? My children... Everything is so confused, I don't... I can't wait much longer, he's getting impatient. If you don't love him, I wouldn't marry him. You wouldn't? You're a real romantic, aren't you? I'll walk you to the ferry. Come on. You can't let a tough break ruin your whole life. I know you can't. Just like they say, you gotta snap out of it and take an interest in things. I know you do. The most dangerous erosion is not the land, but your capacity for living. What you looking at, Sam? Just measuring, Miss Carol. The water won't rise until they close the gates. How they get the electricity? Is it in the water all the time or do they squeeze it out somehow? No, Sam, it's the fall of the water. The force of water coming down the mountain. If you come down to the dam I'll show you, okay? Yes, sir. What will you all do when the water starts covering the island? - Let the white folks worry. - We all gonna drown? Of course not, but you've all got to get off. Who's gonna look after us? Who does that now? Mrs. Ella, she looks after us good. Wouldn't you rather look after yourselves? I've got an idea. Can all of you come down to the TVA office tomorrow? We can talk about it. Mrs. Ella won't like it. Think about it. I'll be in there all morning. I want to thank you, Mrs... I don't know your name. Carol. Okay, Carol. Don't worry. Everything will be all right. Will it? Sure. If we help a little. There we go! Do you mind if I come with you? No. Do you mind? Do you mind? No. I haven't talked to anyone in so long. I know. The current will carry us across. Slowly. Slowly. What's that song? It's just an old hymn. And he walks with me. And he tells me I am his own. And the joy we share as we tarry there, none other has ever known. I think it might work. What? What you was talking about. Come with me? I want to show you something. Sure. Would you get me the key? Oh, my... You all right? I'm all right, thanks. This is...? is this the first time you've been back? My, oh my. I had someone straighten up a few weeks after, but since then... There's that river out there. Granma loves that river. Maybe she could come here, sit here and look at it. How come you never suggested it? I just thought of it. You never thought of it before? I never thought I'd come back. You really loved your husband, didn't you? Jim. Yeah. Yeah. Can I ask you something? When I told you about Walter... About who? Walter Clark. The man who wants to marry me. Yes? You said that I shouldn't marry him if I didn't love him. Yes, I said that, but as a sort of general rule. Is he a nice person? Yeah! Well... And I like him, but... Maybe I'd get to love him, after I was married to him awhile. You think it ever happens that way? No. If I married Walter, I could come here and live with the children. And then, maybe Granma come. But she won't, I know she won't, she'll never leave that island. I don't know what to do. I don't, I don't. I just don't know. It's getting dark out. Don't go. Please don't go. Don't go. And he walks with me and he talks with me, And he tells me I am his own. And the joy we share and we tarry there none other has ever known. I don't understand. You're behind on clearing the fields and yet, here you have 12 able-bodied men who want jobs. They want to work! - I also said... - Tom. Not now, Jack. I also said that we can't hire Negroes. The whites would quit. That's a chance we have to take. Let's go out back. You think if you take all the Negroes off the island the old lady will be stranded and will have to leave too? It might work out that way. You're heading into trouble with the townsfolk. Our customs is... Look, this is TVA. We're new, we don't have any customs yet. I'm going to hire those men and every man, black or white, gets paid the same. Mr. Glover, I predict your next visit will be from Mr. Moore. We'd like a few words. My name's Sy Moore. Mr. Moore... Come on in. What can I do for you? Thank you. Now Mr. Glover, we've come here to help you. - Mr. Todd is President of our bank. - Just fine. And Mr. Thompson, he's our undertaker, also runs a furniture store, very highly respected. I'm just a plain business man. Won't you sit down? I tell you this so you'll know who you're talking with. You might say we're the responsibles of the town. I see and you're here to tell me that if I hire Negroes the whites will quit, is that it? Why, not at all. What makes you think that? Sorry. Just have to keep them in separate gangs. Keeping them... In separate gangs. All right. I will do that. We were sure you would. Now Mr. Glover, how much you planning to pay them? You're not planning to pay them the same as the whites? The jobs are the same. - You look like a reasonable man. - You do. So just think, after this project is over we can't go on paying them as much as the white man. Would ruin our whole economy. The Federal Government can't make such distinctions. Still, we prefer that you pay their usual wage. How much do the whites get? Five dollars a day. You surely don't intend to pay these darkies five dollars? I'll go out myself for five dollars a day. I'll get you the biggest, strongest best-looking bucks in this country for two dollars a day. We're all for the TVA and we want to help you, so if you'll cooperate on this point, everything will be just fine. If I don't go along with you? As I said, we're the responsibles of this town, but... - There are other type of men here. - Yes there are. Men who aren't so responsible. We can control them only to a point. - Bailey's a good example. - He runs the gas station. He's a very good boy and he wanted to come too. In which case the conversation would've been different. We said to Bailey, "Let's go over and talk to him. " - "Give him a chance". - And that was all right with him. We made it all right with him. - We want to help you, but Bailey... - Hard boy to reason with. Yes. he is. And there's a whole lot like him in this town. Really. We want you to know how we feel about it. I understand your feeling. I'd like to think it over. Betty, would you ask them to come in? You all come on in. I'll be right with you. Hi, Sam. Here we are, boys. Jerry, this ought to do for you and your family, until you find something of your own. Boy, oh boy, who ever thought of that? Yes, sir. We'd have trouble coming through mud tonight. I'll say. Goodnight, I'll see you in the morning. I've got them all jobs. They're leaving the island in the morning. Carol. It's beautiful here when it rains too. No wonder she doesn't want to leave. You're shivering. It's October. I hate to see the summer go. Look at the leaves falling. Chuck. Don't, don't, don't. I don't want to kid myself or you. I believe maybe I'm in love with you. I didn't think I'd ever fall in love again. Soon this business will be over and you'll be leaving. I've got to protect myself, Chuck. I feel like living again now, but I don't want to be hurt any more. Not by anybody. Yes. Do you want to come in? I've been working here all day, and you know what? I'm going to paint every room a different colour. Look. That's all Jim's stuff. Some boots and that old shotgun. I don't know what to do with it. Look, Chuck. Look at this sweater Granma knit. It looks like something she'd do. Stop walking around in front of me, would you? Don't walk in front of me. I'm sorry. I'd like a drink. I'll look. What's the matter? Stay still. Don't. Don't. I'm gonna go. Carol, did you know about this? I had hints. Hints? Carol, you remember that yellow cat we had? Come her season, we used to let her out at night. It was dawn when she'd come back. Now a cat is really quiet, but I could hear her at dawn, sneaking back into the house. I know I done wrong. I done wrong. I know it. How long has Jim been dead now? Three years. That's a long time. I remember when I was young. That's a long time. But I just can't understand going over to the enemy. He's right, you can't stay here any longer. Stop looking at me that way. People say you're crazy. I've fixed my house. We can take the children. We can't stay here any longer. Well, you better go too. I want you to go! Tonight! Go! All right, I'll go, but I'm not going far. I'm going over to my house and I'm going to wait for you. Jim Junior, Barbara Ann! Why are you sitting there? Just resting. Well, rest and then get going. I've changed my mind. I ain't going. Get up. Get up! Never did have no brains, did you, Sam? Don't you know what's coming? Yes, ma'am. You get going, Sam. I want you to go. I ain't going. The ferry pole. Granma. We better go get some groceries. Eight gallons at 18. 1.44 dollars. Bailey, how's Alice? Why, Carol, she's just fine. Do you two know each other? R.J. Bailey, Chuck Glover. You're Bailey? R.J. Bailey. No, I haven't had the pleasure. I'm happy to meet you. That's a nice ready-made family you've got, Mr. Glouver. Glover. - Did I read that right? Carol Garth? - I saw her, too. You think Walter knows somebody's getting in his nest? - I heard he knew about it. - What do you expect he'll do? He's so scared of what Carol thinks of him he might not do anything. He might appreciate a little help in the situation. As for those jobs, that gentleman is handing out... We had a hard day. Give him his supper and put him to bed. What's the matter? Afraid you're getting in too deep? I don't want you to marry me. Do you feel better? That is it. I understand how you men have to watch every step. You can't be caught saying anything permanent sounding. I'm not out to tie you down. You don't have to say you love me. Now will you come in? It's just that I've been taking a good look at myself... And you decided that you're not the marrying type. No, no, it's not... You've got so much to do before you settle down. Don't, please. Besides... let's tell the truth. We're different people, aren't we? You're... I don't know. Everything different. Do you ever need anybody? Shut up. Come here. Don't. Chuck... The children. Hold still, hold still. Anyway now it's wonderful. You can't get enough of me right now, can you? Tell me! I can't get enough of you. Let's put the kids to bed. Let's put the kids to bed. Jim Junior. Wake up, honey. Hi, Jimmy. Little rabbit, little white rabbit... Wake up. Chuck, will you carry me in? Yes. Jimmy! You love me, don't you? Walter, what are you doing here? I came to help you clean up. Aren't you going to introduce me to Mr. Glover? I'm Walter Clark. I brought in some eggs, milk, bread and coffee for breakfast. You didn't have anything. Oh, we... You see, Mr. Glover, she doesn't even thank me. but it's natural to take care of the girl one is courting. Get those kids to bed. They look tired. They slept in the car. They look tired. Will you sleep with me, Chuck? You going back to town? Yes. Would you drive me in? I'll leave my car here for her. Do you mind? No, not at all. Well, say goodbye and let's go. Goodnight. Goodnight. You rest too, Carol. You look tired. Once this Garth business is over, will you be leaving here? It ought to be over pretty soon, oughtn't it? It has to be. That's right. It has to be. You just drive me to your hotel. I'll walk from there. You do have my thought by now? I have your thought. You eat your cereal. Well... Which did you say your room was? I didn't say, but it's next to the end. You left your light on. Goodnight. And I want to pay you a compliment. Carol could do worse. Tonight, we open the jolly festivities, by singing the praises of dear old Redville". What's the matter? Don't go up there. How many are there? Just one. He wants to see you... Go on home. BELL Turn on the light. There's only one of you. I didn't figure I needed anyone else. What do you want? Remember my name, R.J. Bailey, I run that gas station. Yeah, I remember. I also work 400 acres of cotton just outside of town. I'd have visited you sooner, but we're harvesting. Yesterday one of my best hands, Ben, a real nice boy, ran off and joined your workers. Five dollars a day. When I heard about it, I went into the house and got a stick about so long and about that thick, and I went to where he was working. I didn't get out of the car, I didn't want to shame him, I said to him, "Ben, get in the car. " When we got home, I took him into the barn and beat him. He's all right now. I mean, he's thinking is all right now. He couldn't work yesterday or today. Had to hire another boy to do his job for two days. So I figure you owe me what I had to pay that extra. Two times two dollars a day, four dollars. Yeah, Mr. Glover, you owe me four dollars. I don't see it that way. You need some time to think it over. I don't need it. You think it over. Do you want one? You see, Mr. Glover, if you keep stealing our best field hands at five dollars, you're gonna be dealing with my friends too. What's keeping you here? They tell me you're here to get an old woman off an island. There's nothing to that. I'll go and get her off tomorrow. I'll go down and pack her up. Wouldn't you like me to? I want you to mind your own business. I figured since you've been mixing in mine, that you wouldn't mind if just I mixed in yours. But you're like me, Mr. Glover. You do mind. Well, how about it? Four dollars? No. If you don't give it to me, I'm going to take it away from you. You may have some trouble. Oh, man... Good night, Sully. Was you there, Charlie? Then the air was full of hamburger meat. Our friend in Number 3 needs change for this ten. I think I have it. I think you'll get your girl all right, Walter. And I think our friend upstairs will be leaving town soon. This is his change. Take my four dollars and send him the best liquor you can find. He needs it. Okay, I am stubborn, but I can't get it out of my head that there isn't some way to reach that old woman. After all, people are human, I mean, people are human. I don't know if Ella Garth is. I don't care what you call her. She was born, she'll die, won't she? Mrs. Garth! Mrs. Garth! Mrs. Garth! Who's there? It's me, Chuck Glover. Who's that with you? That's my friend, Walter Clark. You've been drinking that corn liquor, ain't you? I acknowledge, I had a drink. It seems to me you can hardly stand up. Mrs. Garth, we've come here we want to talk to you as one human being to another. Walter. You better take this lunatic home. I'll take him home in a minute, but I want to say something. I understand you, Mrs. Garth. I know exactly what you're fighting for. It's your dignity. I know! I'm right? It's your everlasting, ever loving dignity. It's your dignity. That's it, it's your dignity. He's... Well, he sure is. He looks smaller than I thought. That's right. They're closing that dam Monday. You got two weeks to get that island levelled. We haven't got the old lady off yet. Have the U.S. Marshal put her off as soon as you can. - Or sooner. - Clear the land! But what about the bad publicity? There'll be worse publicity if she gets wet! Yeah. I'll get to it right away. Another cup of coffee? Mr. Glover! It's about Ma. This here is Mr. Armstrong, our lawyer. We feel that Mrs. Garth is no longer fit to handle her affairs. We'll declare her senile and sell the property ourselves. You said yourself she was incompetent. Anybody that stays when the water is rising, must be crazy. - The rest of us done got off. - And Joe John and Mattie. Under the law we can have her declared incompetent. I'd rather have her put off at gun point. I'll have the papers ready in the morning. I've known her since I was a boy. I hate to do this. You hate to do it? It all goes under the general heading of progress. Yeah, that's what they say. Heard you had trouble last night. Any complaints? All goes under the general heading of progress. Mrs. Garth? I apologise for the other night. First and only time I ever liked you. Mrs. Garth, Hamilton y Cal came to my office with a lawyer. They'll prove you're of unsound mind and unable to negotiate the sale of your property. Worthless! Can you hear me? They was always worthless! If they can prove it they can sell your land. This whole island will be flooded in two weeks. This house is coming down! You can't stay here any longer! Are you listening? Marshal Hogue has issued an order for your eviction and tomorrow it'll be executed. Come with me now. Mrs. Garth. What are you trying to prove? Sam, all this is going to be under water. I said a house with a porch. It's got to have a porch. So keep trying, will you? When other helpers fail and comfort flees, Help of the helpless, oh, abide with. Jimmy learned a new one. Sing it for me. Jesus loves me, this is know. For the Bib... Hi. Hello, Chuck! How is it? Okay. You look tired. What you been doing all day? Looking for a house with a porch. Good night, Chuck. Good night. Frances, just put them down for me. Get to bed, honey. When I first came down here I thought, "How can one person go against what's happening in the country?" There she's been, sitting there for 80 years and I was going to get her off in one day. I was even looking forward to it. Imagine. And now, I have to make sure I get her off alive. Goodnight, honey. Goodnight. You're becoming human, aren't you? I was always human, wasn't I? Then you'll be leaving soon. Not for a couple of weeks at least. I have to wait until the land is cleared first, and stuff like that. A couple of weeks? Maybe more, maybe a little longer. A little longer. I'm going now, Mrs. Carol. Good night, Frances. Good night, Frances. Here you are. Chuck. Yes, dear? I hate to say this. Say what? Something I hate to say. What? When you go, take me with you. One day soon, you're going to come to me and you're gonna say, "Carol, I have to go. " And there won't be time to talk, or to think, or anything. And there'll be a car waiting, and then a plane and you'll say, "Carol, honey, I have to go. " Isn't that right? Yes, that's right. Take me with you. Did I tell you what happened after you left with Walter? No. He came back here at the middle of the night and he nearly broke my heart. How? I kept saying to him, "Stop looking at me. I have nothing to give any man. Except if I love him. " He kept saying, "He'll leave you after his job's done, but I'm forever. I'm forever. " He's right. I wish you hadn't said that. Why did you say that? I know it's true, but why? I know it's true. I know. I'm leaving here, with or without you, but I want you to know something. I'd be a good wife for you. A damn good wife. I'm smart in some ways and I know what's good about you and what's bad and I'm not afraid to tell you. I have two children who love you. They love you and I love you. And you're not easy to love, but you do need someone. And I love you. I love you. It's stopped raining. Don't say anything. Don't. I'm afraid of what you might say. I don't know what to say. God, that says it all. That's not what I meant. It's what you really meant. It's what you are thinking. I heard you. I asked you and you said "no. " I heard you. Chuck. Anything. What do you want from me? I'll do anything. I'm sorry to break in here. I told you... I owe it to him. Carol! What is it? There are men coming. Silence. Turn off those lights. Alden, give me that rifle. - Whose truck is this, Buddy? - Walter Clark. Get out. I don't know what's happening. Mama! I'm in here, honey. I'd better pull down that shade. Walter. What happened? Are you all right? Chuck! It's your old buddy, Bailey! I've brought my friends along! Got you all packed! What are they doing with my car? Excuse me, Barbara. Don't you dare go out there. Got your ticket bought all the way to Washington! Got you a travelling mate. How'd you like to go to Washington? - What do you think? - They're just having fun. Mommy! Mommy! You go... Did you see that? What are you doing in my pickup! Get out of it! Bailey, you damaged my house and you're paying for it! - Time to go, Mr. Glover! - Bailey, you shot at me. - I shot at the lamp. - You shot at me! - Well, Mr. Glover. - Sure is nice to meet you. - Sure has been fitting to meet you. - When are you going home? - How's Eleanor up there. - Who's Eleanor? Eleanor Roosevelt. My pickup. You did! I'll see you to the train. Glover! Watch it, Chuck. Bailey. There's no way to scare me out. I came down here to do a job and... Carol! Muss him up! What that matter with you? What are you doing? No, no don't. Let me go. - Do you know what you just did? - Don't hit a woman. I don't want a word out of you. Time to go beddy-bye. You just smacked a woman right on the ground. Don't hit a woman. Don't hit a woman. Who else is gonna say a word? Go on, another word. I want to hear another word out of someone! Just say one word. - Sheriff. - How you getting along? All right, I guess. A little tired. Why don't you all go on home? Anything I can do for you, Mrs. Carol? Get off my place now. You know... I wish some day I could win maybe one fight. You were wonderful up there. I don't care if you ever win a fight. Marry me? I know I'll probably regret it. I'm sure you'll regret it, but... Get your hat, get a coat, wash up. All right? All right. "And now, by the authority invested in me by the State of Tennessee as a Justice of Peace, I pronounce you man and wife. What God has joined together let no man put asunder. " Five dollars, please. Five dollars, please. Anyway, it's got a porch. I hope she likes it. "You have refused to vacate said property you are therefore, hereby commanded to immediately and forthwith vacate the real estate, buildings, outbuildings, and the premises, designated as Tract 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 7, and this you'll in nowise fail to do under the penalty of the law. Signed, Allan R. Nealy, District judge. " That's it. What are you waiting for? There she goes! Well, this is it. Granma, you look kind of tired. Don't you want to go in and lie down? Carol. Yes, Granma. I owe Frank Zachary 16 cents for two pounds of sugar. You see that he gets it next time you go in. Yes, Granma. That's all I owe. Anybody. Chuck! Well, here she goes. Granma just died. You had it to do. There was nothing else you could've done. It looks like we're ready to go. Go ahead. Yeah. Okay, go ahead! "Truly, truly, I say to you she who believeth hath life eternal. " Barbara Ann!
