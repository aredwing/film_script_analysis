Well, almost. Names? Names don't matter. Catching them is what counts. My dad says if you're poor for too long you'll shit white like a seagull. Crab. How long can you hold your breath? Don't know, about half an hour. Half an hour my ass. You see? Now that's a miracle! Brinco, get me out of here! What a bastard! I'm fine, damn it! Brinco! Brinco! Brinco! Brinco! Brinco! Damn the day you were born! What are you doing? That brings bad luck. Quit yapping and help me. Look, there's a disgusting creature inside. Come back to life, shithead. Look who's here. You dummies. Never joke about death. He looked dead, Leda. You should have seen him. He fell and turned pale, stiff. Damn, Fins. You looked dead. - He has "absences". - "Absences?" Yeah, "absences". That's what they call it. Don't tell anybody. And those coffins? - They're spoken for. - Not your dad, of course. - He says he saw them first. - He did. Keep quiet, you're dead. They're hippies. Heard in Ultramar. They look German to me. Think it's French. Who cares what they're saying? You can tell by what they're doing. If they're hippies, they speak hippie, you idiots. I'm up here! It's Chelin. Bet he found something! No wonder. Running around with that damn pendulum all day... Leda thinks it works. Leda believes whatever she wants to. You see? He does it with his wrist. You're a fraud, Chelin. Let me. Come on, let's go. NATURAL SCIENCES HUMAN LIFE STUDIES PRACTICAL GEOGRAPHY Damn, Chelin. This is what call a treasure! Goddamn it, Carburo! It's okay, kids. It's okay. Some people love artillery. Always tell him, "Carburo, first ask questions and shoot after." Sweetie, where did you come from? You can ask my mother that. Does this saintly woman have a name? She did. Her name was Adela. She died when was born. Damn, they sure grow up quick! They're unrecognizable. Okay, an Nothing happened here, you didn't hear anything, you didn't see anything. That's the thing about Latin, one thing leads to another. Everybody go home. Tonight the sky is gonna crash down on somebody's head. It's finally dying down, the son of a bitch. How long have gone without fishing, Amparo? One month and three days. Seems like three years. Prison was better than this. So was the hospital. Me in prison, you in the hospital... It wasn't so bad. We should put a match to this life and to hell with it. You're a wreck, Malpica. You used to be more patient. Well, before, cried with one eye and laughed with the other. Father, have you ever seen an Argonaut? Once when a Soviet ship crashed off the coast. Russians. The sailors wore black leather jackets. Really good ones. Don't mean people. Look what it says here. "These cephalopods are very ugly animals" and their bodies contain grotesque particularities. If you look into the eyes "of an Argonaut, you will find them blank." Let me see. This book was at the School of the Indies. They emigrated to America, made money and decided to build a school. The best school around. A modern school, they called it. They brought typewriters, sewing machines, thermometers, barometers... Even a skeleton so we could learn the name of every bone. All of them. What's the most important bone in the body? The spheroid bone. The teacher used to say... How did it go? "Children," this is the key. The spheroid bone. The bone shaped like a Turkish bed and bat wings which quietly opened through the course of history "to make room for the enigmatic workings of the soul." Damn, still remember, Amparo! If you were there, don'! go back. Why? Because say so. Study. Amparo. If this weather keeps up, the boy... I'm sorry, but he'll have to clean barrels. He gets dizzy in the barrels. He gets dizzy everywhere, Amparo. Everywhere. Trust me, son. Never tell anyone about your absences. Don't tell anyone. If you do, they won't hire you and they'll say you're crazy. Don't tell anyone. Don't even tell the furniture. You got that? - What is it? - You'll see. Where are we going? - It's unbelievable! - Isn't it? Look, Brinco. The sea is a goldmine. It can give you anything. Who needs fertilizer? Those oranges are mine. Saw them first. You know I'm right. The booty of a shipwreck - goes to whoever finds it. - How much is it worth? A lot And don'! know if want to sell. Here, seeing is hard work. That's crap, Mr. Rumbo. Close your eyes. Now watch. A woman can feel it in her skin. - What was it, heads or tails? - Tails. You see? It's in her skin. This one knew it from day one. She'll be rich someday. Sure won't be poor! Brinco. Brinco, Brinco. Brinco. Brinco. Brinco, come on. You dummy. Hi, boys. Afternoon, Marshal, sir. Well done. If the barrels aren't clean... What's the word? Immaculate. The whole harvest gets ruined. Just a tiny speck of shit... and it all goes to hell. How are you, Brinco? And you? Fins, sir. Fins, Fins what? I'm Malpica's son, sir. Lucho Malpica. A great sailor, your dad. Yes, sir. The best. Remember, not even a speck of shit. The best sailor, strictu senso. And the most stubborn. Damn, what a mule! Eat them all. The best, John Wayne. John Wayne and a horse. With that you have a movie. You don'! need girls or any other crap. But he did have to change his name. His name wasn't John? No, his name wasn't John. His name was Marion. Marion? No shit. Where have you been? Looked for you in the yard. Omelette. Your mother made it. Look, Rumbo. If the bad guy is good, the movie is good. Am right? You are. For example... think I'd make a great bad guy. What do you think? Yes, Sergeant. You'd make an amazing bad guy. Well... Don't be so sure. Joan Crawford, Jennifer Jones, Hedy Lamarr, Ava Gardner... We're talking cinema, boss. We're talking about women. Joan Crawford, Jennifer Jones... Gentlemen, if we're talking about goddesses, we should be speaking Latin. Gloriosi corporis misterium. The mystery of the glorious body. Saint Thomas. Three years of seminary school, Sergeant. Rumbo and talk about it all the time. Mutatis mutandis. The body and soul belong to John Wayne. With him and a horse, you have a movie. You don'! even need a girl. What for? Not even the horse, just a gun. You need a gun, of course. Brinco. Stay away from the school ruins. It's a diabolical place, everybody says so. Pretty, isn't it? Help me. Let's take it. Where? Grab the feet. Gently. Gently, she says! ...A western with kisses that kill. On the right. Tonight at the Paris Theater in Noitia, William Morris and Gene Pascua in an unforgettable film. What a beauty! How much do you want for it? It's not for sale. It's priceless. You're wrong! Everything has a price, sweetheart. The roar of revolvers and passion rising from the ashes... Not the ruins... Yes. No. Yes. Where are you, Fins? In Finland. How about you? I'm in Brazil. That's a long way away! Okay. One, two, three. I'm in Norway. And you? - In the water. - That's not a country. Well, that's where am. Okay. One, two, three. I'm in the Belgian Congo. I'm in Libya. Meet me in Sudan. We should go, before it falls. It's okay. It won't fall. Greenland, Spain, Ecuador Antarctica... It's time for the penalty kicks. Up first, the amazing Brinco, local icon and feared sharpshooter. Impossible! An amazing stop by Chelin. The damn spider stops everything. He blocked the kick. Up next, Leda, stepping up to the ball with confidence. What's wrong? Girls don'! kick penalties. - Who says? - Tell the truth, Chelin. You're scared. Chelin is shitting in his pants, ladies and gentlemen. No way, Belbis. I'm not a homo! We know all too well that God needs nobody's help to impose His will. He's almighty. Then why did he create man? Imagine for us to handle the little things. The metric decimal system, for example. Replacing broken tiles, cleaning sewers... That's why we must recognize that someone like our generous parishioner we know as the Marshal is doing this world a great service. Even just by donating the modern PA system we've just installed. Thank you, Marshal, sir. We will use this modern PA system to spread church doctrine. And, on occasion, the mysteries of theology. God, not satisfied with creating man, also created the two people who with him constitute the beautiful calling, the Holy Trinity. The Son, His son, and the Holy Ghost. An incomprehensible figure represented by the dove. Nothing is more beautiful. Because what is the true shape of the Holy Ghost? Am! Belbis! Look, Belbis. The Holy Ghost is everywhere. But no matter how much you insist, you're not it. So quit clowning around, damn it! Tonight's first song is dedicated to the nicest couple here. Our beloved policemen, of course. There's a shipment at the beach. Get moving. Slowly, slowly. Always sticking your nose where it doesn't belong. We live here just like you. You have an answer for everything. My mom was right. Look who's talking. Your mom of all people. Rumbo says we can start unloading the tuna. And these two Martians? - They work for free. - Great. Not for free! That's it, don'! sell yourself short. Hey, that girl, before you know it... Pure dynamite. That's the last one. Nice going, Brinco. You earned yourself a bill with kings on it. Never bring guests along - without consulting me. - They tag along. "They tag along..." Go on. Good work! Come on, the Marshal's going to pay us. Get in line. Thank you, Marshal, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Boss, the police are coming. They always have great timing. Everybody stay pl... What's going on here? Evening, Sergeant. You dropped two bills. Estricto sensu, two green ones. No, Marshal, sir. Esticto sensu, think dropped at least ten. The footage is coming in, it's still dark. We can't tell what's happening, the image is black and white. But this footage clearly reveals that Aldrin, the 2nd astronaut is still inside the lunar capsule... Where'd you get that? Mr. Rumbo paid me for cleaning the barrels. Nobody's ever paid that much for cleaning barrels. It's the truth. Don't lie to me. Silence is the worst lie of all. Where'd you get it? The Marshal paid me for unloading tobacco. That's more than make in a whole damn week fighting the sea. You know how he got rich? They say in Cuba. Cuba! He never set foot in North America in his whole life. He had a cistern truck. A tanker. But not for carrying wine or oil. He carried people. He'd fill it with people. They'd give him their life savings to take them to France. Then he'd drop them off somewhere in the middle of the night and say, "You're in France. La France. Take a hike." France my ass. They were still in Spain, totally lost. How about that! The only decent thing he ever did was enter the school when it was on fire trying to save all the stuffed animals. The first one he saved was the fox. Antonio knows it's his daughter who gets them into trouble. Antonio knows that with Adele dead, his daughter is all he has in this world. Let me do that, Lucho. You don't know how. You're a fisherman, not a sea-blaster. This isn't rocket science, Antonio. - Have to start sometime. - The fuse is too short! Pray for us. - Holy Mother of God. - Pray for us. ORPHANAGE OF THE DIVINE SHEPHERDESS SANLUCAR DE BARRAMEDA, CADIZ - Mother of God. - Pray for us. Holy Mother of God. Pray with me. Pray for us. Pray for us. It's your last night. Pray with me, son. - Mother of Good Advice. - Pray for us. - Mother of the Creator. - Pray for us. - Father of the Savior. - Pray for us. - Mother of the Church. - Pray for us. You have to get up early tomorrow. You have to take the first bus or you'll miss the train. Go to bed. Good night, Mother. Never forget to take your Uminal. I'll send you the pills every month. TWENTY YEARS LATER Look, Mr. Malpica. Her hands are working much better. Her skin even looks younger and her hands are lighter. Good for sewing, right, Amparo? Who will that be for? For my son, when he's born. Mother. Can you hear me? Do you know who am? I'm Fins. Fins? Nice to meet you. I'm naming my son Emilio. My Lucho. Lucho. Lucho... It's a nice name, Mother. Hope you visit me. I'll be working in Noitia. Noitia, remember? Noitia... went there once. To buy thread. It was very, very hot. Like before a storm. What will you do there? Secret stuff. There's plenty of that going on. Where are you, Fins? Here. Where? At the teacher's desk. Have you learned that much? I've learned my share. "All is silence," remember? You laughed at me when read you that poem. But that's what it said. "All is silence." "Deafening silence." That's what it said. What about you? Nothing to tell? That you're still there. In the ocean. In the middle of the fucking ocean, yeah. Not a single letter in 20 years. Well, thought of you more than you think. Every day All day lons? Well, not me. Learned to forget. Every day! Every hour. Ripped up plenty of letters. Letters? You ripped up everything. - I'm back. - What? I'm back. Have a son. He's Brinco's. Know. You know why came here, Fins Malpica? To tell you never want to see you again. Don't call me, don'! talk to me, don'! look at me. You got that? Will he ever go to bed? The bastards never sleep. There might be a snitch. Just someone busting balls. The sergeant knows his place. Tomorrow he'll show up asking for more and we'll have to give it to him. That's how the world works, Carburo. You can'! rely on anyone. Damn, Brinco. You're wasted. - You're using your wrist, Chelin. - Yeah, bullshit. There you go. Finally, let's get to it. Okay, Carburo. Time to conquer the West. Let's go, boys. Is everyone here? Okay, gentlemen. There are 25 ships with tobacco in all of Europe. Most are in the Mediterranean, Greece, Italy, Sicily, around here. That's right. Even along the coast of some Communist countries. They smoke too, of course. And at this point... what's our position? You called, sir? It's about time you called me by my first name. Yes, sir. The sea brings only the finest. Who needs fertilizer? I've said that before. Yes, sir. We traditionalists often repeat ourselves. Brinco, you're my best driver. That's what they say. The best. Carburo! Go ahead! Inverno, full speed ahead. I've never given you anything, Brinco. How's the boat, Inverno? This isn't a boat, boss. It's a frigate, a flagship. We could cross the Atlantic. The flagship is yours. Don't worry about the papers, it's in your mother's name. Then we'll call her Sira. Sure, that's very nice of you. But in that case, we'll call her Sira. There will be more. You're right. There's an arms cache. Something weird is going on. - They're leaving. - Follow them. - What are you doing? - Wait, wait. Who is that? It's Fins. The bastard! Come back in an hour, Monica. In the alley, like a blur, watching the corner... You sure could sing tangos. Remember? The cannery supervisor was always shouting, "Keep singing! Keep singing!" to keep all of you from eating the mussels. "Keep singing!" How miserable! Aren't you going to open it? Go on, open it. Silver anniversary, diamond ring. Hard to believe. Do you need something? Yes, need you to make a few calls for me. I'm expecting an urgent message. How about dinner later? A little seafood, goose barnacles, leche frita... - Good morning. - Good morning. Is Domingo there? He's asleep. He worked all night. Okay, I'll call back later. Listen up. Don't wait for Domingo. He worked last night and he's asleep. You can work the "imos indo" coordinates. Have a good day. The coast is clear, over. Okay, we won't wait for Domingo, over. Santi! Is Mr. Lima there? It's urgent. No, he isn't. I'll give him the message. Tell him it's from Domingo's wife. Domingo went to work. Domingo went to work. It's urgent. Understood. Monica. For the Marshal, personally. Rock, paper, scissors. One to nothing. One to three, no cheating. Rock, paper, scissors. - Three to two. - Rock, paper, scissors. - Three to three. - Rock, paper, scissors. Leda! What happened? He's fine. The eye doctor prescribed it. Don't tell me you're cross-eyed. It's called anmiopia. He's anmiopic. See? Cross-eyed, he says... What a brute. Anmi-what? His eye is lazy. We have to cover the good one to make it work. - He looks good, huh? - He looks great. You look like a pirate. - Wanna go for a walk with Uncle Chelin? - Okay. Let's go, kid. Let's put that lazy eye to work. Damn, the things that wash up... Wait there. I'll show you the second-most important thing a man needs to know. This washed up too. Come here. Like this. Gently. Know what it's called? What? It's called Astra Llama. Understand? Cool, isn't it? It washed up too? Actually, it came from a dealer. You know what a dealer is? Sure you do. A dealer is someone who works in a casino dealing cards. But there's another kind of dealer too. - A horse dealer. - A horse dealer? Yeah. We'll go see one some time, you and me. But don'! tell anyone. It'll be our secret, okay? Now aim straight. Let's kill that fucking cow, there's millions of them. Ready? Good. That eye is coming along great. I'm sick of counting boats. I'm sick of everything. Especially the sofa. My whole body feels like imitation leather. Don't worry. You'll be living in a mansion soon. Oh, yeah? What mansion? Yours. I'll take care of it. You'll see. How will you do it? If were Marshal... I'd pay off the head of customs. What are you waiting for? Fins Malpica. What are you worth? Don't say you have no price. What about you? What are you worth? Dead, more than you. What's a dead cop worth? We're cheap. They give you a medal... and a few lines in the paper. You want medals? We'll buy you some. You want lines in the paper? Fine. We'll buy reporters, anything you want. But you're not being honest. Why not? Because everything has a price. Be nice. - Still have your absences? - No, no. Almost never. With all the money you'd make you could spend your time taking photos, since you like it so much. We have people everywhere. You took this one of me at the airport in Oporto, with Mendoza. It was an interesting trip. But you already know that. Sure, do. You didn't take this one. Not this one. With my friend Pablo Escobar in Medellin. Look at his face. He was happy because somebody just gave him Bonnie and Clyde's oar. It's historic. This is my favorite. This one you did take of me. Gave my wife quite a ride that day. Yes, sir. You can keep it. - Don'! want it. - Keep it. When you decide on your price, any price, write it on the back. We're destined to befriends, asshole. Heard you wrote a report that's like a novel. A very good one, by the way. They even gave you an alias: Simenon. A good review ruins any good book. They'll bury it, you'll see. Well, loved it. Especially when you say, "Your Honor," in Noita, "true power is exercised in darkness and silence." - Damn. - Bravo, seriously. You sound like an anarchist. There's a storm coming in tomorrow, Sira. We should go somewhere together some time. There are some wonderful places, Sira. You always wanted to go to Lisbon, know. We've been singing fados all our lives and we've never been to Lisbon. What a disaster! We've never even gone to Madrid. Could take you to a nice hotel. The Palace, the cinema, the opera... To the Prado Museum, Sira. It never occurred to me to enter the Prado Museum, but that's where the Italians always want to meet. Thought, "What a marvel, Sira." Museums are the most wonderful places in the world. Better than natural landscapes, better than Niagara Falls. I'm telling you, always the same temperature. The ideal climate. Because of the paintings. They must be kept at a constant temperature. Paintings are very delicate, more so than people. Sira, sweetheart, tell me what you're thinking. Please, give me all the nasty stuff. Insult me, darling. Go on, call me arrogant. Cocky bastard, son of a bitch, captain of industry, entrepreneur, Beelzebub, beast, piece of shit! Say it! For God's sake, Sira! You went silent. What are you thinking? Have an opinion, but it hasn't reached my head yet. The legend of the fastest driver in the Atlantic is over. You're the boss now. You'll have to watch your back. That's why they hired you. Exactly, to watch your back. Among other things. We have a long trip ahead of us. You should see the old man. See him every day. He's my favorite ghost. You're like a son to him, Brinco. A son? Mendoza, if I'm going to be your boss, spare me the soap opera. You got it? If your speech doesn't please the boss, give him another. I'll prepare another one for you. Where are you from, Detective? Was born here, sir. In Noitia. Your parents live here? My father died a long time ago. - He died at sea. - I'm sorry. A stick of dynamite blew up in his hand. - Wow. - Yeah. My mother's alive, but has memory problems. Alzheimer's is awful. My mother had it too. She confused me with the weather man. She'd kiss him whenever he came on. Damn. This is embarrassing. Want to speak to your superior right away. - Right away. - Yes. Who are you, the Generalissimo? No, Lieutenant Colonel Party Peeper. Yes, sir, Lieutenant Colonel, sir! Holy shit! The lark! Where the hell is the lark? It came straight from customs, boss. It was sealed. Sealed? I'll seal your balls if don'! get my lark. Who has it? Take it easy, Brinco. People are watching. Can get you a Rolls emblem. The spirit of ecstasy. Stick your spirit of ecstasy up your ass. want my lark, okay? You know what a lark is? - Yes. - Do you? Yes, do. Didn't until the Cuban bastard who sold me the car showed me. And want it. want it. Want it. This car isn't the same without the bird. What's this? Damn, Brinco. - You can'! move it with your wrist. - What? It's energy. Yeah, right. Three. Have you seen Leda? Give them a bottle of champagne. Mendoza. Have you seen Leda? No, haven't. Where were you? Sorry, got tied up at home. Such a beautiful woman needn't apologize. Want you here with me, damn it. I'll be right back. Yes, Miss, but tell me. What was it that sunk the Titanic? No, not the fucking block of ice. Greed. Man wants to be God, but... he's just a worm. That's right. An inebriated worm who thinks he owns the fishing hook. Marshal, sir, rumor has it... Did you write down the thing about the worm, God and the hook? Yes, Marshal, sir. Your name comes up often as future mayor or even senator. Gentlemen, I'd like to say a few words before speaking. Miss, won't beat around the bush. Politicians are assholes. Scumbags. Plenty of campaign promises... Excuse me. Did you write that? No, don'! write that. Write this. I'm apolitical. Absolutely apolitical. Absolutely. But write this too. As Marshal promise to sacrifice myself for Noitia. That's right, sacrifice myself. And to fight for freedom. The freedom to create wealth, not destroy it. To work and make a living with our own hands. Like we've always done. All right. How did your fortune begin? Estrictu sensu, with culture. Yes, with culture. Cinema, dancing, hamburgers... Nobody here had ever eaten one. Look, Miss. Nobody's ever given me anything. I'll tell you the truth. Believed in Noitia all along. All along. And I'm going to rebuild it. Work is love, that's my program. Conserving the landscape is the latest fad. Great. What will we eat? The landscape? Write that down, please. The part about eating the landscape. It's a good metaphor. It's not a metaphor. told you, I'm apolitical. Say what think. Look, there are two kinds of politicians. They're either crazy or they can'! see what's right in front of them. I'm not here to sing Christmas carols. What office will you run for? Whichever one win, obviously. Miss, my party is Noitia. like our way of life. Religion, family, festivals... If that bothers people, to hell with them. But strange things are happening in Noitia. Do you approve of smuggling, sir? They say the drug trade is casting its nets here. Its nets? Did you know that you catch more fish if you take a woman hunchback on your boat and she pees on the nets? That's reality. The rest is fantasy. Write that down, please. This is information. Is that clear? Look, Miss... Lucia. Okay, Lucia. I'll tell you what really think. Smugglers are people with honor. They earn their money... At least in Noitia, they earn it by working. Who do they hurt, the tax office? Fine, I'm willing to admit it. But the tax office doesn't have kids and grandparents to feed. You didn't mention the drug trade. For God's sake, what can say about the drug trade that anybody in Noitia can'! tell you? What will say is that if I'm mayor, I'll put away the drug addicts. It's funny. People are talking a lot about organized crime. Your paper does it. Well, if crime is so organized, the government has to be even more organized. Because there are some very bad people out there. That we know. So let's all contribute to organizing the government properly.. - What about...? - Ipso facto, Miss. Hello, son. Hi. This is the first interview I've granted. Hope it's not your last. Add a little criticism. Saying nice things about people is the best way to sink them. - Aren't you...? - I'm nobody. Can take a photo? Of course, of course you can. Never sell a gentleman short. One question. With or without the hat? - With the hat. - With the hat. Even better. If it's good, the paper will sell out. What if it's bad? It'll sell out anyway. "Smugglers are people with honor." That's balls for you. There you have it. A masterpiece to include in your secret report. A secret report which right now have to say is vex populi. Take no offense, look. Noitia's football team is touring America with Brinco as president. Spectacular. A modest team leading the league with its captain, in this case, Chelin, the new head coach, an expert consumer of narcotics. Okay, won't bother you any more. You can get back to work, but one thing. Feathers are going to fly tomorrow at dawn. See you later. Go suck an egg, Grimaldo! Tell them what you know, why don'! you? He's rotten to the bone. He should be the one writing this report. That's all of them. Every single one. - They sold out. - told you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Lieutenant Colonel, this is Mara Doval. She's our language expert. And she has an amazing memory. She remembers everything. Well... Okay, let's hear it. Is Mr. Lima there? It's urgent. No, he isn't. I'll give him the message. Tell him it's from Domingo's wife. Domingo went to work. Domingo went to work. It's urgent. Understood. Explain, Fins. - Who are we listening to? - Yeah. The woman calling is Leda. Leda Ortas. She has a son with Brinco, a legendary speed boat driver who's gaining power in the organization. Leda's role is to spy on the customs boats. She calls the hair salon run by Guadalupe, Mr. Lima's wife, officially-speaking. And Mr. Lima is the Marshal. Right. And who's this Domingo? Domingo is captain of the customs patrol. Damn! These things still happen? They don't need a look-out. They hired the head of customs directly. But we're getting lucky. This is unprecedented. Some notes in the Marshal's handwriting. An unexpected collaboration. Impossible. The bitch waited quietly for 25 years, like a dead cat, to stick it to me! Hi, Brenda. Hi. You know what? Guadalupe isn't coming. What do you mean? Until when? How should know? She's not coming, period. Don'! understand. It's easy to understand. She's not here. She's gone. She's never coming back. Now do you understand? Here. A message for you. A valuable one. Listen, Monica. Since you got here, you haven'! seen anything, you haven'! heard anything, you don'! remember anything, do you? No. No. I'm very sorry, Marshal, sir. She's been dead for six hours. What condition is the body in? Nothing visible, sir. Not a scratch. It's surprising given the waves, the rocks... No signs of violence either. It's clear she drowned. She must have fallen in the water. The sea is treacherous, Guadalupe. told you that. Always told her that. LORD BYRON MEDITATING ON GREECE'S FREEDOM Sir, we have fresh news. Operation Noitia begins tonight. Carburo, you win at pool by scaring the balls. Whoever it is, I'm not here. Yes? Yes, sir. He's right here. Viriato wants to say hi. Yes? Thank you. Thanks for the invitation. Carburo, we're going to Portugal. We need to cross the border before nightfall. Your shipwreck lady looks beautiful tonight. Don'! recognize the other two. The prodigious memory reporting: He's manager of a bank branch with a sudden and unusual interest in Noitia's transactions with Panama and the Cayman Islands. She just opened a jewelry store and one month ago she was broke. You really think people will buy Multiply by three. Multiply what by three? - Everything. - Everything? Everything. What are you taking? - Garlic pills. - Give me one. They're not garlic pills. Don'! care, give me one. Have a little problem, since was a kid. It's a variation of epilepsy. It had stopped, but... it's back. They used to call it "absences". Absences. Okay, well... even more reason. Want to try being absent with you. COMPLIMENTS OF VIRIATO Look how lucky. It's on the house. Excuse me, I'm going to the bathroom. We would have paid for it. You can pay for the drinks. I'm going to the man's room. What are you doing? Let you live since you got here, but swear you're a dead man. Who do you think you are? Never touch me again, bastard! You're still cleaning barrels! You smell like crap! Coffins won't do it this time! - You smell like crap! - Son of a bitch! Not any more! Let him go, Fins! That's why you came back! What are you going to do, shoot me? Will she? Get in the car! A total of 36 people were arrested last night charged with belonging to a ring of smugglers and drug traffickers as part of "Operation Noitia." Searches performed by police have resulted in the seizure of large quantities of drugs, cash and some weapons. We've hit the tobacco smugglers hard as they move onto drug trafficking. This is much more than a warning. Society should be at ease. The criminals are the ones who should be uneasy. Told you, Spanish TV comes in great here. We got screwed. Big time. What happened, Detective? You'll hear about it shortly. Please... - They're letting them go. - What? On bail for peanuts. can'! believe it. You know who was there to help them? - Who? - Rh negative. - Rh...? - From the Supreme Court. They let him go! - Can'! believe it. - There's no way. Gentlemen, this is good news for Noitia. My client, our friend Brinco, has been released. How do you feel after this experience? Fine, fine. Better than the people who arrested me, think. Slept great, but tonight I'll sleep even better. That kid is history. Are you sure? He's being taken care of. Milton's two thirds. Who's the messenger? Okay, okay. How's Leda? Is she okay? She's fine. Lost track of them, that's all. I'm on it. Set up another drop off. have the coordinates. It's all taken care of. Don't worry, Brinco. Trust me. The payment will be delivered to your door step. For your trouble. You're not using again... - What? - Are you? - No, no. - Come on, Chelin. I'm not using again! Trust me, okay? Trust me. - You sure? - I'm sure. - Fix it and call me. - Okay. They've got you by the balls. Okay. You already know this is Leda's new house. I'll settle for the bed. But tonight we have a surprise for Santi. Follow me. You wanted a friend, didn't you? Did you or didn't you? You sure? Look. There's a friend for you. Okay, Brinco. Just to show you that your friends do things for you too. Look. Know I'm outside, but the day die, know you'll have to cry. Cry and cry. Cry and cry. You'll say you didn't love me, but you'll be very sad, and that's how you'll stay. With money or without, always do as please and my word is the law. Have no throne or queen... Leda! Where are you going? To dress up as a hooker. Don't be silly, listen to me. I'll bring you luck again. Remember when we looked for treasure? Discovered something. discovered that they only exist in the ocean. That's where shipwrecks and the dead are kept. You have to look in the ocean. Come on, say it with me. "Ocean." I'll show you my second-favorite thing to do in the world. Nobody's given me anything this special in a while. What's wrong, baby? Everyone's asking for you downstairs. You disappeared. Wish could. You should have said you were bringing a harem - of hookers to my house. - No, no. They're employees of our club. Our club? Yeah. You disgust me talking like that. Disgust you? You mark them like cattle. How much did that one cost you? Which one, Leda? Which one, damn it? Don'! know who she is. They all cost the same. One Bible. What? - Have to go to Greece. Help me. - Greece? What for? I've always wanted to go. Okay, fine. Give me the money and have a nice trip. There's no money. They tricked me. They were another gang impersonating ours. What bullshit is this? Need your help! They're coming after me! You can go to hell! Where the fuck are you? Where are you, damn it? Chelin... Is something wrong? No, nothing. Nothing? My routine. You can'! go up there. What are you doing? I'm buying her freedom! If your pussy can work miracles, raise the price, you got it? That's how the fucking world works! Go to the football field if you have the balls! Don't touch me! Leda! For God's sake... Chumbo, no distractions! Everyone's worried about the shipwreck lady. Mom, should swim? Swim, swim! Mom, should dive? Santi! Santi! How long did hold my breath? How long can hold my breath? Hurry, Leda! Santi, come quick! Chumbo! Chumbo! Hurry! Every year, Inverno and Chumbo gave their donations to Our Lady of the Sea, the Virgin of Carmen. And it was Inverno who paid for the new bell. It's fitting to ring it now in this requiem. God is light. He sees everything. What to be thankful for and what to punish. Remember this. Let it guide your course. In summary, God isn't as dumb as we think. May Inverno and Chumbo rest in peace. And pray also for Chelin, who lived the life of a dead man. The religious ceremony is over, Marshal, sir. Now you can carry out His will. Don't like the party you're planning. This is sacred ground. Just a little tribute, Marcelo. The music they liked. In Noitia, a funeral used to be a funeral and a party was a party. I'm leaving, my work here is done. Your work, thank God, is never done. You have to protect us. We're your flock. Marcelo, let's meet some time and talk about Unamuno! Know I'm outside, but the day die you'll have to cry. Cry and cry. Cry and cry. You'll say you didn't love me... Do you trust me, Fins? Your silence worries me. Go ahead, Grimaldo. Look. This is the Mino River, the Tui Bridge... Here, in northern Portugal, this Sunday, there's a meeting. A very important one. Very few people, but very select. You should take a look. Why are you telling me this? Got two pieces of news from the doctor today. The first was very bad. have cancer. But the other was wonderful. The disease... will kill me very quickly. How was the funeral? I've seen better. The priest and the mariachis... weren't bad. Brinco, Lieutenant Colonel Alisal has been arrested. Our people are dropping like flies. I'll have to disappear for a while. Go somewhere far away, son. Hell, for example. If you can, even further. Brinco! They always brought you luck. Why didn't you go with him? You should take your son away from here. Something bad might happen. He didn't ask me. Can find out where he is if you want. Is it true you can'! type without looking at the keys? What does that matter? I'd like you to write a letter for me. To make up for all the letters you never sent me. There are people who have never gotten a letter. Come on. Close your eyes and I'll dictate. Have no paper, Leda. Good. Like the sound of the keys. My dear friend, now all is "silence". - Did you spell it with an? - Yes. Good. How did it go? "Now all is solitude," pain... II No. Don't write that. Wasn't going to. Bastards! Die! Leda, run! It's burning, see? Yeah, can see. Can see it's burning. Should we put out the fire? Why are you asking me? Have to decide if the fire gets put out? Who am? Who? Is anyone still inside? Nobody. What's in the suitcase? Nothing, my things. Memories.
