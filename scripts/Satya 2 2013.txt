Police don't want to know and... ...understand this... ...and they keep claiming they finished the Underworld. But both Police and politicians should understand this that... ...as long as people are unhappy with the system... ...and there's a disparity between the rich and the poor... ...no police can ever erase the underworld. Underworld never dies ...it just changes its form. And history tells you that every new underworld... ...has always been started by a Single person. Now anew Underworld in 2013 will be initiated by one man man... ...who's about to get off the train. The name is Satya. I could have punched yourface and left. You should be thankful that l just hit you on the back. You never called or messaged me. Tell me one thing am l the only one concerned about a friend. You show up whenever you've work in Mumbai. Now tell me how are you? Now come... Come on. Yes! Darling... Yes! Satya's here. He just arrived. Yes... dear... do you want all the details over the phone. I will talk to you later Keep the phone down. She was my GF. I hadtold you... ...that when I become producer she will be my heroine. She is already heroine ofmy life This is my palace. Check it out. Now listen carefully. Water comes from 5 to 5:30. But don't worry. When that gujju switches on his Ac this bucket gets full. At first l gave lots of slang to him. I even decided to kill him one day. But now l thank him... ...as I use this to clean the utensils The aunty residing beside our flat is mad. She drinks a lot and in evening she tries to jump. But you don't worry. Don't worry at all. One white cat comes and cleans the dirty plates. But you don't take tension about it. You just chill So... ...how did you find this place? This is hotel cum theater cum... ...jogging track... all I one. Hey. Laugh men l just cracked a joke... ...when l will become the producer l will make you villan Mad. First you get fresh then lwill show the Mumbai city. Hey! How's Chitra? She is all right. I didn't tell her that l was coming to Mumbai. Why? Due to some reasons... and you know what? ...she is writing poems these days Chitra and Poems? Ya Some days back she recited one I've written a poem want to hear it? How was it? Very nice. But what does it mean? Stupid. You should not go for meaning of poems... ...instead go for the feelings... got it? "With moon in it's drape..." "...the night blossoms." "The heart skips a beat in anticipation." "L wonder what has happened to me." "With moon in it's drape..." "...the night blossoms." "The heart skips a beat in anticipation." "Lwonder what has happened to me." "I see your image in clouds." "L write your name on water." "I see your image in clouds." "Lwrite your name on water." "You leave your mark behind." "The way you run your fingers in your tresses." "L wonder what has happened to me." "Everyday my glance is stuck at one point." "When my eyes can't find you." "Everyday my glance is stuck at one point." "When my eyes can't find you." "The heart still has hopes." "L wait at the window for you." "Every sound reminds me of you." "L wonder what has happened to me." "With moon in it's drape..." "...the night blossoms." "The heart skips a beat in anticipation." "L wonder what has happened to me." "With moon in it's drape the night blossoms." 'Satya never told Chitra who they were... ...or what happened? ' 'Chitra also didn't know that... ' '... Satya left straight for Mumbai.' 'Satya started studying the city carefully.' 'Of its hunger greed... ...jealousy and hatred.' 'At first look this is just a city of a arge mass of people 'lt just keeps growing everyday.' 'But if you look closer... every person has a face... ' '... and every face has a thought behind it 'And every thought... has a destiny.' 'And every person inthis city... ' '... is busy trying to change their destiny.' 'But the city of Mumbai is actually an entity... ' '... that asserts its own destiny on others.' 'its true that Satya was just another face in its millions... ' '... but the difference is he's come here to change the destiny of this city.' Where the hell are you? I have been waiting foryou since morning. I have two tickets of Salman bhai. Lets go watch the movie... Come on hurry up. I got a job. Where? Satya. We met yesterday. You have asked me to come today. Yes come in. Gangaram confirm the deal with gulati Ok Sir. What are your qualifications? Engineering But the job I'm going to give you will not be related to that. I can do any job or can make others do it. I like it. But there is a thin line... ...between confidence and over-confidence Just trust me To get the job done. I like this even more... Sir Mr. Khanna has called 3 times. if you could discuss the account Tell Khanna Sir calling repeatedly will only increase the bill... ...not the amount on the cheque. Go. Deepak take 7 crore instead of 5 and settle this... Deal? That's the spirit Lahoti sir. Talks of millions like its loose change. So? That's not a big thing. You will come across many others like him in Mumbai... ...born with a silver spoon in mouth. Morons are driving cars... ...intelligent people like me are riding bikes. Listen Satya for the rich girls are an object... ...and the poor are a curse. The poor can't afford a single room to live. And the rich have homes they never live in. Because they live outside the country. The truth is the poor are like the carpet for the rich. The rich always walk onthe carpet. Few think it's are fuge... ...while others think they're being crushed. But take my advice Satya. Listen carefully. Never underestimate anyone in this city. You will never know who's carrying... ...a million rupees in a plastic bag. Just remember those who stand outside... . and stare atrich people's homes ...can never get to sit next to them You know Satyal have a good script. Really nice. But nobody will finance me. Because I am poor But the time will change. I will get what l wants That should be your only motto. Hey! When did you come? You didn't even call me. This Is my friend Satya... I had told you that day. How did it go the other day? I am talking to you. Why are you making faces? I 'm talking to you. Talk to me. I forgot to call you sorry... Let it be now. I said sorry... Shall I make Taj Mahal for you now... You won't talk? You won't talk? Naraa. Leave it - Are you angry? Are you angry? Naraa... leave it. Okay fine fine. Hi. What's your name? Satya. I heard that... What your full name is. - That's it. Oh... ...first time I heard such along name. I'm special. Whole world will know this when I will make you heroine. This is my name. You might have heard it first time in your life right. There is along short story... ...why my name is special. I will tell that later... about my present. I want to become heroine in films... ...of some musicals Romantic films And later l wantto get married to this idiot also This is my life till now Where did yout wo meet? In a camp. We had lots of fun for3 months Right Satya. I thought you both were from same place. No... no... So where are you from and... ...what for? Where from doesn't matter. Work gets done from the mind not from background. Wow... Not only brilliant but you are smart also. You are the smart... he is not. So what work you want to do in Mumbai? You have to do a special work for me. Go and meet RK. RK? Yes RK... He's an ex-gangster... ...who used to work for Bada Raja. He's not that powerful anymore But still he has his reputation And he could help in dispute between me and Sanghi... ...regarding the Vikhroli property I already had a word with RK. L just want you to meet him... ...and give him the details. RK. Lahoti sir sent me. That rascal was abusing my men. And he was doing it publicly. I found out that he's in a hotel in Juhu with a girl. I barged in. I barged in and sliced him up. Where are you from? L want to meet RK sir. What work with him? - Lahoti sir sent me. After that till 2004 I have killed his 10 people. I had support of Bada Raja Saheb. Thinking police can't do anything and with that over-confidence... ...I did anything I pleased. Iwas in jail for 5 years. Now Raja sahab is no more... ...and times have changed to. Who's he? Lahoti sir sent me? Hey Sanghi... ...why are you having issues with Lahoti... Now do you want to settle this or increase this matter. Daddy. You know Lahoti is my important person. You both are inthe same business so learnto share. You scratch his back and he'll scratch yours. You'll be happy and so will be I And I hope you will give me some good news. Understand. Thatmla's son is making nuisance we need to shut him up Are you crazy? I have told you many times don't get into this mess. Why don'tyou understand such a small thing? Why doesn't he understand? L told him repeatedly don't challenge me. And anyway if we don't shut him up... ...then we will look like idiots Someone give him some cold water. Calm him down. You talk like me. At your age I used to sound just like this. Honestly. But that time was different... These days we need to keep cool and do our job. I heard you're threatening people again. Listen lf you call Sanghi again... ...l will come home and shoot you dead. And listen Bada Raja's dead. Getit? if you try to threaten people again... ...l'll make a bullet hole in your back. Understand. Lahoti sirl don't wanna create issues with ACP Bharti. You know the time... ...has changed now. It's not like olden days... ...l would've barged in Bharti's police station and cocked him. If Bada Rajahad been alive... ...these cops wouldn't have the guts to interfere. Not now This one is necessary. I was sure of you... I've made lot of commitments in Dubai regarding this land. They already made investments. Do anything and sort this matter? Look Lahoti sir I understand your problem. But You understand my issue. - I don't care. I cannot kill anyone anywhere now. I cannot create a issue with ACP Bharti. Can I give a suggestion? Go on. As far as I can understand... Sanghi knows our situation... ...and he'll never accept our deal. And your Dubai commitment will be in danger. There's a deadline too. So there is really just one solution... we should kill Sanghi... Moron... ...even we know. That we need to kill him. Even the little kitten in my house knows that. But do you think it is that easy. We just bump off Sanghi and chill at home. ACP Bharti... who will handle him? Nonsense. Can I complete what l am saying? My suggestion is kill both Sanghi and Bharti... Sanghi's so confident of his friendship with Bharti. That he did not make an official complaint of RK's call. That means only we know about this. And with him dead no one will never know a thing. I will give you a plan in which... ...they will die in different places differently. And police will never know... ...that this was due to Vikroli plot issue. After hearing my plan RK sir with his experience can tell ...whether there's a problem in my plan or not? And you have to take final decision What is the plan? I have something on my mind... I would like to say it in detail. I'll need anna sir 'No one knew that one small suggestion by Satya... ' '... was going to change the entire face of Mumbai.' 'But only time and sometimes history knows... ' '... this is how something new emerges.' 'Without any noise There is a corporator named Pandharkar of Behrampaada area. He gives instigating speeches against muslim. He is friend of ACP Bharati. There's a meeting next Tuesday at Pandharkar's place. ACP Bharati will be there with his Security I have arranged for Pandharkar to be killed there. Pandharkar? ACP Bharti will also get hit by a bullet... ...and media and police will think... ...that ACP got hit by accident Only we will know... ...this is actuallyto kill Bharti. And Pandharkar was sacrificed That's what Sanghi wil think too. And two days later Sanghi will die. Sanghi visits Bandra's Rose Apartment 242... ...on 24th floor to meet his Girlfriend. Sanghi's brother-in-law is a powerful politician in Haryana. The police will find evidence that will indicate... ...that Sanghi's brother is behind this murder. And now Anna sir and l will tell you the murder plan. Control! Control! Control! Control! "He is going to control." "He is goingto control." I feel the plan's... perfect. So this way ACP got hit by the bullet passing through Pandharkar ...and the ACP also died. It was a coincidence That he died Sources say that Pandharkar's instigative racist speeches... ...is the reason why a militant group devised this plan. This incident has made this situation tense. The police are trying to bring things under control. People are worried... ...and it has affected Leaders as well. The Chief Minister has shunned this incident... ...and the Police Commissioner has said that... ...the culprits will be apprehended soon... ...and they will face capital punishment. And now we have news that... ...on the 24th floor of Bandra's Rose Apartment in flat no. 2402... ...builder Sanghi was found dead. His dead body is found in an apartment of a girl named Sabina. Sanghi's wife's brother is a powerful polictian in Haryana. In the flat police found evidence pointing towards him. Bloody amazing... ...bloody amazing. When you told me the plan at first... ...l thought it is so filmy. Honestly I never saw this happen in movies either. Satya. I wish we had met before. You could've solved so many of my problems. You've no clue. No clue. Earlier I used to stay in Mira Road. In a cramped one-room... And my journey to where I stand now... I have gone through many phase of life to be here. But what you did... I could've never done it. Because... ...you're bloody amazing. You are Satya. Welcome Satya!!! Welcome... Welcome to my humble abode. Please come. Promila... Police have surrounded youfrom all sides. This is Lahoti junior... ...he watches lots of police serials. When did you come? - Listen to her. Doesn't make a difference whether l'm home or not. Meet my wife Promila. Satya. - Hello. Promila do you know what Satya did for me. I was bowled by him in cricket This is a great achievement. Making my husband admit he has lost is a big deal He has done much big deal. He has clean bowled by competitor also. Now he is in my team for permanent. Jr. This uncle doesn't laugh. It's your job to teach himto smile. And your job is to make coffee. Tell me one thing... How you did this... who are you? From where did you come from? What's your background? I respect you Lahoti sir. You gave me job a flat. An identity. But I've a request. Kindly don't ask me about my past. Ok. No problem. No problem. We will talk on other stuff. Are you married? Do you have a girlfriend? Satya. Until yesterday you were just another employee. But now you're special. And I always take special care of my special people. Lahoti sir... I've no one in this world except for one. Her name is Chitra You left me alone for so many days. Do you know how much I cried? And suddenly you call me and say come to Mumbai. This is not done. You trouble me because I love you. Now stop it Chitra. I had told you on the phone. After what happened back there... ...I didn't have any other option but to leave. But still Satya. Now leave it l will never leave you again. We will live in Mumbai now forever. Lets go home This one? Oh... Hey! Whose house is this? It's ours. What? But Satya... My boss gave it to me... But this must be costly? My boss has many flats. Hmm Is this a stove? How am I going to light it? With electricity. This bed is so soft. How am I going to sleep in it? I think I'll have to stand and sleep. So you are Chitra? My name is Special. What it is? This is my name... Special. There is along short story behind her name... Oh... Satya does some building works. What will you do in Mumbai? I will take care of house. Take care of the house? I loved this idiot only to take care of my home. I am away from house for the same reason. Now tell me where did you guys meet? Now stop it... CID... a television show comes of police people. Want to put her in that... She'll fit the character. Satya... is her name really'Special'? And does she hit Naraa always in public? No that's just in good fun... What fun? I can never think of hitting you even in dreams In dreams? You hit me 132 times in real Shut up! Now shut up and show me Mumbai city. "There is nothing without you." "Nothing without you." "There is nothing without you." "Nothing without you." "I hear nothing without you." "I say nothing without you." "The sky and earth will be there..." "...but l won't be there without you." "May we never live without each other." "The sky and earth will be there..." "...but l will always be there with you." "Says my heart." "May lt read the path you take."

"There is nothing without you." "Nothing without you." Satya I've a friend Malhotra... He owns some steel business. He needs your help. Go see him. I am sending you the adress on sms. I don't know what you can do for me. But let me tell you whatl expect from you... I've a daughter. A month ago... ...she went to our Satara farm house with her friends. I've prospective businesses in Satara. One evening she was taking a stroll... ...when a car stopped next to her. They pulled her inside the car. The car was... ...roaming on the highway for 4 hours. There were 3 guys. Out of the 3... one was MLA's son Maane. Police gave me info thathe is underground now. And cannot be apprehended. But the truth is he's in Mumbai and I know where he is. I know Police has destroyed all evidence of the rape. So that whenever Maane's caught... ...no case can be built against him. I have money... ...there's nothing I cannot buy. But yet... I cannot avenge my daughter I cannot. Because they have power. Power. Even Mumbai Police can'ttouch Maane. That rascal's... ...having a ball after ruining my daughter's life. Satya... I want Maane to be brutally killed. I think apart from your... ...daughter there must be many others who suffered at his hands Do you know anyone? Many. You were all made to suffer by that Maane. I'm giving you a chance to take revenge. This is not a favour. I've my own personal interest in it. And in return you'll get your revenge. Salim. Who is it? Pakya. Don't kill me. Let me go. Forgive me. Save me! No. No. After Maane's death the second chapter... ...in Satya's life began. Lahoti introduced himto Gupta. And Gupta introduced him to Bajaj. All of them were rich and famous people of the city. And old players of this game. They all knew Satya was special. Satya's growth was based on one policy. And that policy was... The real strength of power is in concealing it. Slowly Chitra started getting used to Mumbai life Special had become close friend of Chitra. Since he behaved so normally with all of them. Naara Special Chitra none of them knew... ...that the Satya they're sharing popcorn with... ...will soon become the king of Mumbai. Hello. Who the dance bar owner? Tk has gone to kill him? How many times l tried explaining him but he just doesn't understand. That dance bar owner has political connections RK sir I have told you many times... ...we have to hide our strength And what T K did... Killing in public will bring us onto police radar. How many times I said. The real strength of power is in concealing it. You want me to control myself. Me? I have a question dad. Justlike that. Am l your illegitimate son? Was I born of a prostitute. That... Bastard always comes and pees on me... And it doesn't make a difference to you. Tk Yes... ...use this voice to speak foryour real son. That guy used to ask Permission to come inside our house and now... He tells us what to do... That jerk Satya... ...Is telling whole Mumbai that "I brought back the dead RK back into business. I gave him his fame back. He's grown big again because of me. Bloody ass Dad. I admit Satyahas brains... ...but he could've done nothing without your support. The people he's surrounded by wouldn't give him a second look. He exists because of you. And you have kept him on your head. And me... Tk All I proved by beating that guy is that l am your real son... That's it. End of story. Speaking up for my own right was wrong? Be careful of him dad. Because if you don't... then I'll have to save you. Remember one thing. These people don't take long to take undue advantage. Understand. Give me one chance. I'll do a better job then that jerk Satya. You want money respect honour don't you. I'll get you all that. Me. People will know only Tk RK... Get me? Dad he's an outsider. So keep him outside the door. Believe in me. I am your son. Your own blood. Give me one chance. I'll make you the don. Give me one chance. Just one chance. Dad. Run. Shoot that bastard Don't let him escape. Where are you running off to? Stop. Bastard Don't let him escape. Kill him. Don't leave him. Find him. You mutt. Barking at your own master. Don't spare him. What the Look that way. You look that way. But why would anyone want to kill you? Maybe... They mistook me for someone else. Satya this is not a movie. And the rage that they were displaying in killing you... I don't think so. They had any doubts about who you are. But why would anyone want to kill me? That's what l am asking. Lf there was no reason... ...why would you run? Special don't be a fool. Did you want him to wait there and get shot? You're such a... Whatever. Whoever they were. They tried to kill him in broad daylight. We need to complain to the police. But what good is that? I am sure it was a mistake. Mistake. What's wrong with you RK? You okayed a hit on Satya? Your respect honour is all because of Satya. He could never go against you because he respects you. You didn't do the right thing by listening to your son. I Gupta Malhotra we are all furious with you. Disputes Between us are only good... ...for the police. Sorry. These cat and mouse games... ...only give rise to trouble. They always spell trouble. Have you seen those Tom and Jerry cartoons? Remember what Happens? Sometimes the cat gets the best... ...sometimes it's the mouse. Sometimes the cat wins... ...sometimes the mouse. But... ...the mutt always gets the best of both. 10 years later... I'm getting back inthis game. And I don't... ...want to ruin it ...and let the police get the best of us. Lahoti you're right. Only the police will benefit from our dispute. We're all in the same business. We should work together. Mistakes Happen Everyone makes mistakes. Just say sorry and move ahead. I said sorry. I said sorry. He said sorry. TK Tk Bastard Your son had arranged to kill me... ...as soon as I stepped out of here. Whether you believe it or not I believed it And so... I did this. He's your son you love him. I understand. But you should understand... ...that we're all here for our own motives. I didn't kill your son. It's your man ...this should make you realize... ...how much your own people hated Tk And Some people present here said I should kill you too. But I didn't do it for two reasons. First... You gave my life a new turn. You didn't do it for me. You did it because... ...you saw your own benefit in my thoughts But your understanding benefited me as well. And I am thankful to you for it. And secondly you had the brains to understand my thinking ...but your love for your son blinded you. I hope this has knocked some sense into you. But if you still want to be an enemy I've no problem with that. Because In the path I have chosen... ...will Make me lot of enemies. And you will be just one of them. And That too not special. I've decided to open my own Company. And my advice to you is that... ...you Should spend the rest ofyour life in retirement. What Company? A company that has no name... ...or face. Lahoti sir Fromthe study I did ...this was biggest weakness of all the past dons. Their desire to be famous Finished them I believe... Mr. Dawood lbrahim made the biggest mistake... ...by giving D Company his name. By publicly admitting and accepting Sharad Shetty also ...invited trouble for themselves. That goes for Abu Salem as well. My Company will be just 'Company'. Only l will know about its structure. And in future even you won't know about me. The product of this company will be fear. Because something that's... ...invisible... ...has no shape is more scary. So what's the plan? I mean how will you form the company? L will tell you all in detail when the time comes. And until then I need A lot of investment And later money will come by itself to us. I need some special members for this company. I need to form a structure to work with them. Until I do that I need your trust... ...and your money. Of course. We're with you. - Thanks. And I've a request Gupta sir I've heard that you've good connections in the film industry. Satya. Satya. Satya. Where's Satya? - Whathappened? Satya. I've hit the jackpot. I've hit the jackpot. Won't you ask what happened? - What happened? I have become a producer. I've found a financer. But who arranged funds for you? I don't know. He's a big businessman. He liked my story. Just fantastic. Didn't l tell you? I had told him. "All and everything. One and only motive." I did it didn't l? Now I'll make everyone's life better. Yours mine everyone. Sir my name is Satya. It's not important for you to know who I am. It's important to know why I have come here. Can I come in for a while? Do you live here alone? It's none of your business. Come to the point. Sir I have studied your track record. You gave 24 years to the police department. To save Mumbai's rich people fromthe underworld. You Killed 81 times You risked your life many times. And what did you get? The moment Underworld got finished. The rich people forgot you since their work was done. And your own department suspended you for taking a bribe... ...which they still don't have proof of I hope that after all this you must have understood. That whatever you have to do you have to do it for yourself. And if the fake accusations are actually true... ...and you are just greedy for money... ...l will give you so much money that you can't even imagine. I am starting a company. I have come to give you ajob offerin it. What company? Understood? You Know how to make tea? Make One for me too. I know you are a proficient financial expert. I will give you a single cheque of 50 crore. You just have to shift to London with your family. And prepare such a structure for my company... ...that no one can find out where the source of 10000 crores has come from I know 50 crores is a huge sum for this work. But compared to 10000 crores... ...the sum of 50 crores is nothing. And you are very important in the structure of my company. You won't be fool hardy enough to reject such an easy job. But Because now you know about my company. And after hearing all this if you refuse due to any reason... ...l will have to kill you. Why will I refuse? Whoever joined the company none of them knew... ...who else is part of the company. Satya created a special team only on the basis o his convincing power "lf you ask you get nothing so snatch everything." "Lf you ask you get nothing so snatch everything." "Lf you ask you get nothing so snatch everything." "Lf you ask you get nothing so snatch everything." "The way you want..." "The way you want..." "The way you want..." "The way you want you get your God." In The past underworld killed some rich people... ...and From the fear that rose from it earned a few crores Rich people would pay 1 crore 2 crores 75 lakhs. And in Some time it totalled into afew crores. Now in 2013 l will do something that my company... ...will earn 1000s of crores 1000s of crores! Three people will die. Firstly the country's richest industrialist. Sunil Chandani. Secondly the police commissioner of the city. P.N. Singh. And thirdly owner of SNN media channel Gurdeep Raj Desai. The reason of killing Chandani is that... ...the corporate world is the richest. After Chandani's death all corporates would runto the police. But this company won't run away from the police. Infact on the announcement of the company... ...the police commissioner of the city will die. So that any policeman will think ten times... ...before stepping out of the police station. The reason of killing media baron Gurdeep Raj Desai is not money. All channels newspapers and internet broadcasters... ...will get the company's warning. To Only broadcast what the company wants them to do. Or else they will also suffer the same fate... ...as Raj Desai. The death of these three will be the company's advertisement and also its launch Another thing. Lahoti Saab I arranged for Rk Saab to be killed Because in such a big plan as this There's no point in letting Loose ends like Rk to be still there But Satya from where will you get shooters to kill such people? There won't be shooters in my company. Laxman coffee What happened? Bring quickly. Brother the work is done. What! You have still not found out? But the police sources have informed me... ...that it's his servant's doing. Sunil Chandani murdered. I can't believe it. The entire economy will shake. Our security is more important than market crisis. Lf the government can't take the guarantee of VIP's security... ...then what about the common man? If common man is not safe why is the government there? The government will have to give a reply for this carelessness. I will not leave them. Anyway l will talk to you later. Because I am getting ready for the highest TRP ever. Right in Delhi. Fast. Give me the countdown. Hello. I am Gurdeep Raj Desai from SMM news channel. Today's biggest news. Country's biggest industrialist Sunil Chandani has been murdered. Yes sir. We are doing our best sir. I will brief you tomorrow on the progress sir. Yes sir. I will let you know sir. Keep quiet. Silence. Silence. I will tell you tomorrow. Try to understand. An entity called company has taken the responsibility ofkilling... ...Sunil Chandani. Gurdeep Raj Desai and P.N. Singh... ...one after the other in a single day in broad daylight. Seeing this forget common man... ...even politicians and police department are scared. And a very terrified Home Minister... ...looked into the entire police department... ...and gave the most formidable officer of the department... ...Sudir Mahajan the task of going after the company. But before SudirMahajan could even take charge ...and go to his office Satya killed him. "Satya." "Satya." Within a few minutes of taking charge ...the company killed SudirMahajan. What is this company? Who is its owner? The police have still not found any clue of the death of industrialist... ...Sunil Chandani media baron Gurdeep Raj Desai... ...and commissioner P.N. Singh. The question arises who else the company is targeting. The entire police department is alarmed by many such questions. Now the company has started. And on this festive occasion l want to... ...thank everyone especially Mr. Lahoti. Because without all of you this company couldn't have been formed. And l want to request all of you to understand this. This company is bigger than all of you and me. Because the company is a thought. We should be loyal to its thought. And inthe future if due to any reason... . lf. l feel that even any of you is going against the company... ...or is thinking of betraying the company... ...l will kill them myself. I know who you are. And where you live. But you don't know... ...who I am. And where I come from And maybe my name is not Satya. Due to the terror of the company... ...all the millionaires of the country... ...kept huge amounts of money ready even before they got a demand to pay So that there is no delay in making the payment. Because in the history of the country... ...no one ever felt a bigger threat than this. To defeat a dangerous player... ...you need another dangerous player. And the Maharashtra government felt that only... ...retired police commissioner Dr. Purshottam is that player. Because there was a time when entire Mumbai underworld... ...was afraid of Dr. Purushottam In his career of 30 years ...caught or killed most of the underworld criminals. And in the process of breaking the backbone of the underworld... ...he developed an ache in his back. Because of that he retired a little early. But the department had decided that... ...it needed a cunning mind like Purshottam. So on that Monday morning a government official knocked... ...on the door of Dr. Purushottam Someone has come to meet you. My experience of 30 years... ...is nothing in front of this new company. Because whatever is happening it never happened before. On top of that I got retired because of my backache. Mr. Purshottam whether you have the capability... ...to break this company or not that's a different matter. But the truth is that the department... ...has no other option but to trust you. Asfaras your backache is concerned... The company's terror is rising. The police have not found any clue. And the Home Minister is not taking calls. Let me tell you that even the press is not being allowed... ...to enter the crime scenes No one can understand what the government is thinking. What is this company? If killed Chandani Raj Desai Mukul Mahajan. In the past 10 days 30 people have got extortion calls. If this goes on our turn will also come. How will we live like that in fear? No need to be afraid. Look carefully. The company is targeting only rich people. Maybe there is a reason. Reason? There is no justification of crime. Whether it's committed on rich people or poor. Crime is a legal term. A person commits crime... ...due to some issue ...or for a motive. Without knowing it calling anyone criminal is foolishness. So you are justifying the company. I am not a judge or God to give justification. All I am saying is that before saying anything... ...you should understand You will feel neither afraid ...nor angry with them. Only l feel like this or you also feel that... ...Satya is not what we think him to be? What do you mean? What he thinks he says he has the way... ...of making every wrong thing appear right. I feel there is something about him... ...which he is hiding from us. My filmy baby You are so filmy. That's why your mentality is also filmy. What you are saying happens only in films. I know my friend. Yes he is quiet. He talks less. That doesn't mean he is hiding something from us. Every quiet person... ...is not strange like Satya. From where he has come? What he has come to do? Why he has come? Look every person has the right to decide... ...what he wants to talk and what he doesn't want to talk. There is something called privacy too. Satya is not just my friend but he is like my younger brother. I know him very well. I can say with certainty that he never hides anything from me. Do you hide something from me at times? Many times. "Satya." Because you need not know about those things. And what you need to know you already know that about me. Whatever. Just promise me. Nothing will happen to you. I can't give you any promise which I can'tfulfill. If there is an earthquake or if there is tsunami while I am standing... ...by the seashore I can't do anything about that right? Butl promise you one thing. I won't let anything happen to you. "Satya." This special team's headquarter has been formed... ...in my house not just because of my back pain... ...but also because l wanted that... ...we should learn something from the company. So that our work... ...our investigation... ...our people should remain anonymous. Like the company. To catch such a cunning and devious company... ...we will also have to think like them. The entire thing is about thought. If he has donned a mask on his face... ...we will also don a mask. If he attacks us stealthily we will also attack stealthily. Because a person loses by his own ruse. Don't waste your time investigating the murders. Because the way the entire thing has been planned cunningly... ...I don't think we will find anything from there. But the money they got must be going somewhere. So keep an eye on those people... ...who suddenly became rich overnight in the past few months. I also feel a policeman is involved in this task. Because the waythe entire thing has been done so professionally... ...it's not possible without the help of a policeman. Someone... ...who has a grudge against the department. For instance Soloman. Papa. Mr. Soloman has come to meet you. Fine. Offer him tea or coffee. I will just come. I had gone to meet Purshottam about my reinstatement Something was going on over there. I saw many cars. Outside. No one was inside. Lfeel... ...the effort to close our company... ...is going on there at Mr. Purshottam's house. What's so surprising? Some special team had to be formed to track the company. I would have had a problem... ...if someone had challenged the company... ...openly in front of the whole country. That would have been challenging the company's image. I never met a man like you... ...in my career of 30 years. Also in my career of 30 years I never said this to anyone... ...which l want to tell you Satya. The first time you had asked me. 'Do you live here alone? - It's none of your business.' There was someone in my life. After her I have been living alone. What do you mean after her? That's not important for you to know Satya. Did you see the photo in my house? She had clicked it. I don't have a single photo ofhers. I don't want any of her memory. I want that henceforth... ...you won't remind me of her. Tell me about yourself. Her name is Chitra. We are getting married tomorrow lt was the most important day of Satya's life. Because Chitra was his greatest wealth. He loved Chitra as much as he hated his enemies. After marrying her Satyatook Chitrato Kashmir. "O my partner." "O my partner." "L was oblivious. You gave me my identity." "L was oblivious. You gave me my identity." "Yes I am. Righ there right now." "O my partner." "O my partner." "L was oblivious. You gave me my identity." "I was oblivious. You gave me my identity." "Yes I am. Righ there right now." "O my partner." "I met life for the first time." "First time I am in a friendship." "Life can be so colourful." "I learnt when I meet you." "I am in love with life because of you." "I am in love with life because of you." "Yes I am. - Righ there right now." "I'm walking on sky." "Whatever l feel..." "...it's because of you." "This has happened with me all of a sudden." "This love story is all overpowering." "I am in love with life because of ou." "I am in love with life because of you." "Yes I am. - Righ there right now." "O my partner." "I am in love with life because of you." After returning from honeymoon Satya got back to company work Purshottam thought that however dangerous the new company may be... ...at the end it was only an underworld company. But his thought process was wrong. Because Satya's company was not actually an underworld company. Satya's company was Satya's own thought. He had his own perspective. It was a way of stopping the injustice of the system. It was a platform to stop ordinary people... ...from getting crushed under the exploiters Purshottam couldn't understand... ...Satya's greed to have thousands of millions. Not knowing that Satya wasn't earning this money for his own sake. Satya wanted the money to reach those people who were getting crushed... ...under the feet of the system. Without them knowing who was doing it. Satya had developed the company network in a way... ...that there were many different people between the company... ...and the people working for it. And money and work would be given through so many hands... ...that no one would be able to trace the actual source forit. No one will come to know as to who was in the company and who wasn't. Even the people of the company mustn't know. In this way many many people became an invisible part of the company. People from all over the country without their knowledge... ...have started working for the company. And without knowing they have become apart of the company. In this way... ...gradually Satya's company spread over the entire country. And started making another system within the system. Company's system. To put it in another way Company was making another lndia within India. 31 names have surfaced Whose total asset value has gone up all of a sudden. These 6 people have... ...got property from their dead relatives. These five people have made profits from the share market overnight. These three... ...have won a lottery. Andthese 16 people have criminal sources. This means that one thing is clear. All the money that they have got... ...has been earned by stealing... ...fraud or by commission. And there is a cursory search on all of them. But all of this come up to only 30 names right? You had spoken about31 names. There are 31. This one name... ...has no background. Allthe financial statements are in white. No criminal history. His name is Naara. Film producer. Get him. As many times as you lie... ...you will have to suffer my torture as many times. Why are you making me do this dirty work? Please let go of me. One day Mr. Chitrajit told me He will finance to me. I don't know anything. Scoundrel! What do you think? Someone just came and kept money at your doorstep and went away. Look I know. All the money that has been invested in your money... ...has been received from accounts of different banks. Are you a girl? And he wants to have fun with her? Or may be you are his illegitimate child. That is why he wants to launch you Who is your friend in the company? What do you mean by vanished? I don't know. Even his phone is switched off. I called up on the sets as well. I spoke to everyone. But no one knows where Nara is. He is nowhere to be found since when I came home last evening. Where did he go? Why did he go? I don't know anything. Maybe... Maybe he is stuck up somewhere at work all of a sudden. And even the phone's battery could be down Chitra in these times if someone wants to contact someone... ...there is always a way to do so. He would have contact from any where in any way he could. I know him for the last five years Chitra. I am sure he is in some trouble. Sir. I think he is dead. Sorry sir. You should have taken care of him right? I had told you that he mustn't die. Satya there is bad news. The climax could have been little better. I had saidthat earlier. Abhi! Hey! Who are you? I am asking for forgiveness for... ...coming to your house without permission Mrs. Nayak. But l wanted to meet your husband. You can talk to me about whatever it is. Abhi! Abhi! Who are you... What do you want? - There is no need to talk so much. But whatever he did with me... ...made me want to come here and thrash him. Who are you? No! Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. No! Leave me. Please. Please. It isn't your mistake Mrs. Nayak. But what can I do? Yes? You have to suffer the result of associating with people like him No! Let go. Leave me! Abhi. Abhi. Abhi getup. Abhi. Abhi. No. No. Abhi. Abhi. Abhi... - I only had one friend. Even if he got one scratch... ...the one to hurt him would be bled by me. And your husband killed him Abhi... - You... No! No! Abhi! Abhi! His mistake was that he was my friend. And your mistake is that you are his wife. No! Abhi! Sir that swine has reached to an extent where he killed your own son. Now what will happen next? You have done... ...whatever you wanted to do. No sir. Whatever l have to do... ...I haven't even started yet. Meaning? My aim wouldn't stop at the rich people and the police alone. I want to go beyond them as well. Politics. Company will kill the CM now. And make such a leader sit in that position... ...who is under the control ofthe company The next CM of the state would be... ...a man from the company. And then? L will cast my eyes on Delhi. Check and mate. Sir. Sir after the interrogation of the people Naraknew... ...we have come to know that Nara has a very special friend. Very very special. And the name of that friend is special lt is a very big problem. And I am sure this has something to do with his film for sure Chitra. I had said it earlier. Why would someone invest in such a film Chitra? No one listened to me earlier. The problem occurred right? Chitra. Without the help of police nothing is possible. I will call after getting a complaint written Chitra. I am hanging up. Hey who are you? Satya. Game over. Game over Satya. There are many cops standing outside Satya. At the door. Nothing can happen as long as I am here. Come on. - What is all this? There is no time. What is happening here? - There is no time. There is no time. Tell me. Who are these... - Don't do anything ...that might prove to be a danger to the company. - Yes. And what about the information... - What is happening here? That is not important. What is going on? - Not important. Who is it? Who gave the information? Leave all that... Hey what happened? - About the safety of the company. You can find out information about that later. Open the door please. Please for God's sake open the door... - I don't want to take any risk. Because police will... ...torture me to find out information about you. Open the door. Please. Open the door. Search throughout the place. Search! Why don't you open the door? Open the door. I had called up because l wanted to tell you that... I am very proud of you... - Open the door. No no no sir... - Open the door. Who is it inside? - Who are you? Open the door. Please. Can I speak the truth? Truth? - Open the door. What? - You move aside. Open the door. It is about the heart. - Please open the door. No sir no. - What is going on? Break the door open. - What is going on? Being apart of the company and by being a partner... ...it was an honor. Satya. All the best for your company Satya. Sir no please... - Open it. Please. Stop it. - Open the door. Please. God's sake open the door. Open the door. Please. Please. Open the door. Hey sorry Promila. Hey Satya. Hey Satya brother. Open! No! Sir l tried to track the phone. But it is out of service. Hey Satya. How Did this happen? I just saw the News on T.V. Who did this to Lahoti sir all of a sudden? Who did this and how? - Someone has betrayed the company. They have given out information Satya what do you feel? Who could it be? You! What? I don't have evidence. But very few people knew... ...the position of Lahoti sir in the company. And people who know about the position of the company... ...and the ones who are in touch with the police are fewer in number. Only you Satya are you making an allegation at me? I have another reason to have a doubt about you. You met Purshottam at the time when he was making a task force. After that you met him at seven different times Yes I did but... - You didn't tell me about it. So? What do you think? You are the only one who works in the police for the company? Maybe you haven't done this deed. Someone else did it. You are a cop and you knew Purshottam from earlier. Or you could be meeting him in your trials to be reinstated in the police... Maybe. But at the moment I don't have any option other than doubting you. And for the sake of the safety of the company... ...I cannot let go of you. I have come here ...to kill you. Solomon Sir for the sake of whatever relation you and I had... ...before killing you l want to know... ...only for my sake... ...if you have even a small amount of respect for me... ...or if you ever had it in the past... ...please tell me the truth... ...that you are the one to have done it. Be it truth or a lie You are going to die anyway. I am a policeman from my heart. And l will be a policeman all my life from my heart. At that time in those circumstances and because of whatever was happening to me. I gave into your words because of the frustration that l was going through. But you should have thought and understood Satya... ...that the respect that l command in the police force till date... ...is only because I am a policeman from my heart. If l would have wanted to be a criminal... ...why would l join the police force Satya? Purshottam Sir reminded me of my reality and... ...rekindled the spirit of a cop inside me. I had come into the system to not go against the system... ...but remain within the system and fight against... ...the people who were against it. You gave me respect and gave me a status. You gave me money. But Purshottam... ...compelled me to look within myself and introspect. Whatever you did was right in its own place. But what Purshottam did... ...forme... Stop it Solomon! Enough. People saythat... ...the shooters and terrorists of the underworld are brainwashed. But the truth is that Stupid police men like you... ...are the ones who are actually brainwashed And this reason alone is enough for you to die Sir I don't understand something. When Solomon told you about Lahoti... ...why didn't he tell you about Satya? That is because... ...Lahoti is well known And Solomon doesn't even know Satya. Who is he? Where does he stay? Satya has made the structure of the company in a way... ...only Satya can meet someone. But no one can meet Satya. Who are all of you? And what do you want from me? Look. Malad police knows that l was coming to file a missing complaint. And if l don'treach there ...they will understand that l am in a problem. Leave me before they come here. Please say something. Why have you blindfolded me? Look. Leave me. Or else l will call the police. We are the police. Now tell me. What do you know about the company? Company? Or else even you will be in a condition... ...that happened to your Nara. Nara? What happened to Nara? What happened to Nara? Where is he? Nara has afriend in the company... ...who funded the film of Nara. We have evidence to prove this. We only want to know the name of that person from you. That is it. Tell us or else... ...whatever we did to Nara. It will seem like a game of Holi. That is it. Nara died in a very bad state. Since you are a woman... ...a lot worse can happen to you. You can think over it. Nara! Nara! Maybe Nara and you don't have a direct contact with the company. Even our investigations till now make it seem like that. But it isn't possible that you don't even know... ...who the person from company could be. Does Nara have a friend... ...who knows his wish to make a film? A friend who isn't scared of committing a crime. Or maybe something has happened... ...that you couldn't understand at that time... 'Crime is a legal term.' 'Maybe... ' '... my face could be resembling someone.' There's one. Satya! Are you going somewhere? Lwas just asking because l was feeling very restless. I don't know but since the time Nara has disappeared... ...there is a strange fear that has gripped me. Please don't go today. It is my life's biggest day today. Today is the day that... ...I had dreamt of since years. Today I don't need your fear... ...but your encouragement. Because if whatever l am going to do today gets materialized... ...fear wouldn't be able to touch you at all. What is going to happen? Our company is going to get the biggest contract today. She says that he is from Bhilwara village of Chattisgarh. This is what Chitra Satya's wife has told her. Contact the Chattisgarh crime branch immediately. Purshottam after checking all the people... ...who have disappeared from Chattisgarh... ...it seems that He could be Satya Prakash. He is missing for the last one year. His father Pushka was a rebel. He was killed some years back in an encounter in the Bhilwara area. Pushka's information was given by a very rich man of the vicinity. Since that time he has started hating Both rich people and the police. And then one day he killed the rich man and disappeared. He got engaged to a girl called Chitra. Chitra. But for the last few months even she went missing. Who... Who are all of you? Where is Satya? - But... But who are all of you? From all the information that I have from Solomon and Special... ...I don't have any doubt that your husband is the boss of the company. Sunil chandani. Gurdeep Raj Desai. P.N. Singh. Sudhir Mahajan. And my son Abhijeet. Satya has killed all these people and started his own company. In the history of this country... ...and maybe in the history of the whole world... ...a bigger criminal than your Satya wouldn't have been born. What happened? She's no more. You know that She's got hit by mistake But she had to pay the consequences... ...for being associated with a person like you. Stop lecturing me and showing false sympathy. I knew someday l would have to pay... ...forthe objective lwanted to achieve. Chitra's dead. My son's dead. Forgetit. What's done is done. I'm here to make anew deal. If you help me finish the Company and give us everyone's names... ...who are apart of it then I can recommend... ...to the Government to lower your punishment. You're such a... fool. The Company is not a human being that you can finish it The Company is an idea And it's impossible to kill an idea. I made the Company but l don't own it. And even if l myself want to I cannot finish the Company. Every person in this country that understands... ...the Company is a Company by himself Once a idea starts to spread then no one can stop it. And you think by arresting me that the Company's finished? Let see what happens in court. Then we'll see who will finish whom? And by the way why do you want to finish the Company? What do you think you're the protect or of the people? You're their well-wisher? I can assure you that in today's times ...the Company's taking better care of the people... ...than your entire system. People like you... ...go after those who commit crimes outside the system. And follow orders of those who commit crimes... . from within the system. You expressed your regret publicly... ...on the death of Industrialist Sunil Chandani. Didn't you know how he was earning his wealth? Commissioner P N Singh. Although he was a public servant... ...didn't your department know who he took orders from? Media Baron Raj Desai. Called himself the Messiah of the people. Don't you know whose empire he was running? And so what if the CM's dead? The most corrupt and rogue politician of the country is dead. He had 100 crores in black money. Didn't your people know that? Those whom the Company killed even your son... ...its because if anyone goes against the Company... ...it becomes the Company's responsibility to kill him. Your uniform stops you... ...from apprehending your bosses. Butthe Company has no such restriction Justly Kill those who are unjust. That's it. That's the Company's policy. And History stands witness to this ...History is made only when something changes. When something new emerges. And for something new to emerge... ...the old has to be destroyed. That's important. I am sorry for what happened with Chitra. And the police started trying to destroy the Company. And started looking for... ...it's members all over But what the investigation Started uncovering? How useful was it for the police? What was Purshottam actually thinking about Satya? Since Satya's arrest what are Anna Gupta Bajaj... ...and many other members ofthe Company doing? And now as the new CM of the state... ...himself is a part of the Company what is Satya... ...planning next? All that is another story... ...which l will tell you some other day. "if you ask you get nothing so snatch everything." "if you ask you get nothing so snatch everything." "if you ask you get nothing so snatch everything." "The way youwant..." "lfyou ask you getnothing so snatch everything." "Lfyou ask you getnothing so snatch everything." "Lfyou ask you getnothing so snatch everything." "Lfyou ask you getnothing so snatch everything."
