Now, conditions have made it increasingly difficult to contain... and high wind continues to spread the flames at a rate of 260 acres an hour. Those fires. Authorities are continuing the manhunt for Butch Latham. who escaped from authority this week. He is considered extremely dangerous and responsible for rape and murder of 11 known women in 4 states.

Alvavedo You leave a scratch on it and I'll kill you, for the better! - Is that the fax from the Sheriff's office? - Yeah, I got it here. Listen to this. Prostitution, petty theft, larceny, computer hacking huffing gas while loitering and endangering human life... contributing the delinquency of a minor and impersonating a police officer. Well, the correction officer should be picking him up now. I know, honey. I got a great idea! ...let's skip Tahiti this year, let's go camping! Till I get poison ivy on my butt! I hope it's not West Nile virus! cooked over the camp fire... That would have been lovely, except cause I never got that fly-fishing lesson you'd give me because... What was the reason? Oh, that's right! I hate bugs! Poison ivy? Mosquitoes? I've never been to Tahiti! What the heck is that noise? Is this a gangbang? Nice car. Put your eyes back in your head! Hey! No visitor!

You're like a fascist or something? Something like that. Ryan. Scab. - Sorry - Idiot! The West was settled approximately This area at one time had the second largest population of grizzlies in the states This park, the last grizzly was shot in 1922. The white man offed them just like they did to the American Indians... Alright everybody. Follow me! OK. Excuse me. When I call your name, please identify yourself. What's your name? Ranger Mike. Ryan Forbes III? Here Ty Brown. In the house. Sanchez. Ohla Lola - Candy Re.. - Reese And I'm right beside you. Kiki Sato? It's Sarto. I guess you'll be... Baby? - No. - You'll think they're real?

I knew Ranger Mike was too good to be true! I see all of you have your backpacks. Let's let a look inside, shall we? Isn't that like a violation of our privacy? Yes, it is.. This is bullshit! I'm aware that education is lacking in this country... but I will not tolerate bad language. Understood? - Bebe, could we take a look inside? - Sure, go ahead! Here! I've never been camping before, but I've packed everything I thought I need. - What is that? - Oh my God! - It's Mr. Vupi! - Are you kidding me? - Yeah right! - Bebe. Ok, I'll take it, none of you have ever really been camping before... or bother to read the list of things to bring! or wear! Where is the officer that brought you up here? Right here! I assume the bag would be check for weapons? Yeah, the... checking. What happened there? I had a tire blew out on the way to the pickup. Spilled my? all over myself. You gonna wanna change that shirt, its an animal magnet. - I'm Ranger Bob... - Jerry Stuart... Mike, brief Jerry on the week schedules show him the gears. and get him acquainted with the map to the route he's going up on. Welcome aboard. Now you'll all need to pay close attention to this orientation. Now, I am not your babysitter. To be quite honest, if you do not follow my instructions... I will not be responsible for you. Jerry there can, but I wont! There are certain precautions that all of you must take while we are on this trip. Now, there are obviously, there are wild animals out there. We have like black bears, coyotes, wolves, as well as timber rattlers. This point is, any of these animals can kill you! - These animals are aggressive. - He's just trying to scare us. The reason I wanted to look into your backpack was because there are certain items that attracts these animals No matter how cute an animal might appear to be, do not feed them! Alright? Wolves were reintroduced to the park some 4 years ago unfortunately the neighboring ranchers were not very happy about this arrangement. and as a result, we have found several wolves traps all around the park. These are very nasty items. I can assure you do not want to step on one of these So it is imperative, that you remain on the trails that we have selected and we stay together as a group. Should any of you decide to wander off on your own. Be forewarned. I am not the good sherppard I will not leave the others to come looking for you. You will be on your own! How do you know we dont have go looking for you? - Yeah! - Yeah! Frankly. I'm not sure that any of you would survive, on your own! So, is that clear? - Crystal. - Yes Sir! It's important for you to understand that nature This place, is sacred. You will respect it, or there will be consequences. - You ever licked a frog? - What? No! - The bathroom's better this way. - OK! Have a nice night. That's a good idea in these woods. I'll be right back. OK? I'll show you our route as well as poisonous snakes and plant leave that you should stay away from. We are here. We will hike up Falling Rock today... ...and camp in Tumbling Creek Falls, that's here. Tomorrow, if we'll put in a full day of hiking we'll reach the second ridge, which will be our base camp. On the first night, we'll camp in tents. Young lady, that is a very poor choice of footwear. Poor choice? These were $300. You're not going up in those. What else did you bring? Well, I could have another pair. How about these? Those are not gonna work. I got these if you're a size 8 Youre kidding right? If they fit, take them. If not, you will not go. Fine. I'm a size 8. What would we do, if we see a grizzly bear? You know, any kind of bear. Well, most people would run, which would be the worst thing you can to do. - I'd run. - You never outrun a bear, son. They can run 30-35 miles per hour I don't have to outrun the bear. I'd just have to outrun you! So... Are What do you do, if you do see a bear? You spotted a bear and he's not seeing you yet. You quickly and quietly get away from it. If you have been spotted, you don't make sudden movement. You'll begin speaking, very softly... and it will help the bear will identify, what you are. Yeah. Dinner. Bears are also getting ready for habitation so they'll be gorging themselves this time of year. I saw one of those nature shows I thought it said, your suppose to make yourself big, make loud noise and scare it. I would suggest you not do that. The bear would consider that confrontational behavior ...and trust me, you do not want a confrontation with him! Whatever! I'll cap that ass. Let's move Hey, what's that? It's a GPS system. I'm just programming where'd be going. You think it matters? It doesn't. Pick up the trash you'll see. So here's your radio and don't forget to change that shirt OK? Hey. Mister Ranger Sir! Ranger Bob. Not Mister Ranger Sir! How about Sponge Bob? - What if we call you by your last name? - Ranger Bob! - Bob? - Bob! Your last name is Bob? Oh. so you're Bob-Bob? John... William... Bob! Ranger Bob! Oh. I've almost forgot what I was gonna ask him. So there should be plenty of food and water up there, for you guys for the week, OK? You guys have any problems, just give me a call on the radio. Michael, parking lots cleared out, I'll pull the gate behind me and lock it. - OK, thanks Howard - You bet! - So the park is closing? - Yeah, till next spring. Normally, we don't close till November, but... fires are so bad this year that, firefighters can't cover all this parks. We're one of the first to shut down just because how remote we are. - So everyones gone? - Yes, well except me. I'll be here in case if you or Ranger Bob needs anything. I'd sure appreciate all your help Ranger Mike It's sure is beautiful, Ranger Bob Here too! Yes Bebe. It's sure is. What is this place? OK folks, let's take a little break. - I feels to tired! - Amazing. Oh goodie, a picnic table! - My feets are killing me! - Hey, what's you got there? Tremendous. Tit-fallious. - Could be nature at its best - Yeah... Maybe... No! Please dispose of the wrappers properly. - Ranger Bob, if a girl wants to tinkle? - She would go her little ways off. and go behind the bush or a tree. - Oh OK! - Watch out for poison oak. - The leaves I showed you? - OK!

Nice to meet you. Bye Great. No reception! Cellular phones don't work up here. There's no service. Besides, you're not allow to have those on this little excursion. You're joking? Could it get any worse? Yo, Ranger Bob! I was kind of evaluating the path you have us going on... ...and I think there a shorter, easier way. - You think? - Yeah. You the computer whiz? Clear your credit, clear out your bank account any minute. Just joking. This is a navigation system and it's showing that, we can save like 2 hours. Son, the path youre talking about, is too close to the ranchers surrounding the park. You remember that little talk we had, about nasty wolves traps? Yes. But if we're careful and I'm sure you know the way We'll stay on course! He's trying to torture us! Alright, let's get going. OK, everyone be very quiet and do not move! Bebe. Did you feed your new friend? Guys, it's disgusting. My eyes are burning! Get the hell away from my Bebe! I'm gonna throw up. This is so gross! This is why we do not feed the animals! The stinging in your eyes will stop shortly as far as the smell, there's not alot of thing we can do about that right now. Kiki. I wouldn't advise screaming again, when you see a wild animal. - Bebe? - I thought it was a forest cat. Stay down with the rest of us. Jerry... It's Bob. Do you copy? Jerry here. I'm at the campsite now. Dropping off the gears. Roger that. OK, here's some soap, this should help with the smell. Falls right down there. - Thanks, Ranger Bob. - Your welcome. Go get cleaned.

In order not to contaminate your other clothes all of you will wear the same one tomorrow as you did today You want us to put those clothes back on? Yes, unless you want to smell like a skunk all week. - That's so gross! - I'm really sorry I didn't know. Excuse me Hey Bebe, maybe you could make it up to me? They're talking about making us sleep in our own tent. I don't think so. Nice job, Scab. A white power tattoo, sitting next to a black man. Well done son. Gotta drain the dragon! You have a dragon? I love dragons. F.Y.I. Ranger Bob. The food sucks! I couldn't even eat mine! Well, maybe it wouldn't have burned if anyone of you have bothered to stir it while I was putting up the tents. - I helped you - Yes, you did Bebe Thank you. Let's talk about what each one of you want to accomplish this week What do you mean, accomplish? Like maybe reflecting why you ended up here? Finding redemption, maybe even forgiveness? - Spider! - Raul Actually this is pretty close in size and color to our spiders here. mostly found in trees. - Spiders? - His kidding right? You know what?

Ranger Bob will be mad! What he's gonna to say when I beat him there like 2 hours or more? Nothing! OK. Goodbye. I don't think you've all given us your best. The trash you've missed now, we've just gonna have to pick up on the way down. - Is there any downhill? - After the uphill. Let's go. OK. North. East. South. Find that, Ranger Bob. We're definitely sent to the top right? Oh yeah. So what'd you do? Poisoned my mother Really? Not like I wanted to kill her or anything. So about 2 years less of college. Why'd you poison her? She'd just ragged on me all the time. About buying too many clothes. My studies. My friends. So you thought you'd give her something else to think about? Yeah. Hey, it worked for almost a year. She always thought she had the flu. Until the bleeding started. Must have been internally or something. You're not in jail? My mother never told on me. They just got me stealing the poison. Just pick that up. Alright, let's pick up the pace! Let's go... Ouch! - You OK? - Yeah. Oh my god! - Sorry - OK. You hear that? What was that? Don't even mess around with me like that, OK? So what'd you do? I used to part time at this older care place Got these old geezers to trust me. Stole their social security cheques, their money.. and take their medications and I'd replace them with placebo. These two old guys... they died on me. - And you didn't go to jail? - No. You see, the cops. They searched me without a warrant. The case was thrown out. Your were lucky. I was smart! It was alright, while it lasted you know. Got a good scam plan now though. Maybe you could help me? You see, old people... they're so vulnerable. They're the perfect target. Nobody gives a rat's ass about them. They're just taking up space. And natural resources. Old people are creepy Madam. I thought you said we'd suppose to be there by now? Just right up here. Wait here. Jerry. You stink so bad! No shit! So do you! You know, I could really use a beer. I could drink one! We're not lost right? No, it's just right up here. It's been more than 10 minutes! "more than 10 minutes" If a tree fall in a forest, do you hear the tree? How do you know its more than 10 minute? Can you tell the time by the sun or something! Yeah, actually... Can I have some of that? No. Did anybody happened to notice when Ty and Kiki left us? OK. Where are they? Where's the camp? You don't know where we are do you? - We're in the woods, baby! - What? It's not funny. Ty! Look, stop tripping alright! It's just right over there. Come on! You told me the camp, was on this mountain top! - The co-ordinates are off a little bit. - Ty! This isn't funny! Should we get there before dark? Yeah, let's just cut through here. My legs! Argh Man! Kiki, help me, Kiki! - Oh God! - It's definitely broken! OK, Get my phone, get my cell phone!

This is Skunk-Off. It will help with the smell. You'll have 1 hour to shower and relax. After that you'll have a few chores to do before it gets dark. Alright put your packs away. ???? I was in juvenile. Is that why you're here? No, it was stupid. I was at a "gang related"... shooting incident. But they don't have shit on me. I was just there. Could you imagine a conversation between Scab and Bebe? - Could you call that a conversation? - No. "Scab, have you ever made it a bear?" "Have you ever like licked a frog?" Idiots... they're all idiots That bitch Candy says one word to me she would leave this camp alive! - Lola Huh? - My housekeeper name's Lola. I'll rather see you after the showers. Definitely. Gentlemen... Here is a list of things, that need to be done before dark. - Wash out all dirty clothes and hang... - Hang them up. Empty all candy bars, energy bars from backpacks or persons. Turn in all food products, all deodorant, and scented products, to be bagged. How else can we get into town Ranger Bob? Are you trying to sell our stuff? Just give me any food products you might have. I don't have anything? Me either. Fine. You wanna be bait. Be bait. Bait. Did he just say bait? - He's weird man. - Yeah. I'm losing blood. Shit.

Sili... what? Unbelievable! She doesn't even know what we're talking about. That's pretty amazing! Who cares... I just want them! Please, somebody help me! I thought that correctional officer guy was suppose to be here too? He was kinda gross... He smelled... Yeah. Where is officer Jerry? I'm guessing miscommunication or he just didn't want to spend the week with all of you. Or maybe he forgot to hang his food and the bear got him. - Yeah! - That's awful! I can't believe how hungry I was! - That's the mountains... - The chicken was really good, Ranger Bob! Yes, Bebe... it was nice of you to help out. It was walking for 2 days, probably taste like shit. We just couldn't tell. I'll eat it. I'll eat it then. You know they gave me these files on all of you. and seeing Jerry isn't here, I thought we should talk about what brought each of you here... You have the files, just read them. don't wanna talk about them. Actually Candy, yours was on top. So I got paid for sex. Big deal! Prada, Jimmy Choo, Chanel are expensive. A girl need her accessories. I am not going to wear the wrong shoes just because my daddy wanna buy them for me. If all fashion at right now and Gucci has this black shoe, that's just gorgeous. So you do this for fashion accessories? Mostly... Hey, I get 5000 a night! Some guy pays you $5000 to sleep with them? - You got to be kidding me? - Nope! I got 5 bucks. I'll give 6 for you. I need to go to the little girl's room. You want to come with me Ryan? Not on my watch! Bebe, would you go with Candy to the restroom please. Sure. You're really are no fun, Ranger Bob. So 5000 just walked by. Ryan, how about you? Yeah, Ryan the third. Corruption of a minor. You got caught? Yeah, you're a rich boy. Why don't your daddy buy you out of this? Believe me he did. She ended up in the hospital. With her legs out. The hospital? My dad had the sex charge expunged from the records. Sex? What happened to the girl? She kind of choke a little... and passed out. Or did she choke on her own vomit? No man. I was at this party and I met this girl... We were having this... amazing sex... with this plastic bags over our heads, cutting off our oxygen. I mean, you have to understand, it increases the orgasm tenfold. anyway, she started to turn blue and... So the real story is... you got an underage girl drunk and then had sex with her while suffocating each other and now you're out doing community service and she what? In a coma? My old man gave her family a pile of money for when she wakes up. - And you're OK with that? - Yeah! and she's 15... it's not that I care about her or anything.. line to Scab. I think I've heard all about I need to in one night! - I'll bet your dad paid more than 5000. - Shut up! It was the best sex I've ever had. Oh god! Get out of here! I'm not gonna die here. I'm not gonna die! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! I'm the big dog. Yeah. See... I'm the big dog! Yeah. Mother! Those showers were disgusting. They smelled funny.

I swear you're the only Mr. Vupi I ever had! What do you think Scab did, to get here? You know that guy with the beard who droved us here? He's weird man. Look like my Uncle Bud. Hey, what the hell was on his shirt? Spew. Spew? I've seen it a million times. Spew. Where you think Ty and that Kiki chick are at? Like you care! Asian chicks are cool. Remember, Ranger Bob said if they don't show by noon tomorrow, he's going looking for them. Well good, maybe he'll get lost too. - What the hell is that?... - Is that your pajama? Is that a bear costume? Yeah. Grizzly Park. It that what you've been dragging up the mountain, this whole time? My uncle own a costume shop in L.A. I borrowed it. He get alot of cool stuff, he rent to movies, like fake police cars, ambulances A costume shop? Do you think he can get me a police car and uniform? That's a bad idea man. That's how I ended up here. What are you doing with that thing? Go make some bear tracks. Try to confuse our Ranger Bob. Who know, maybe, tomorrow night, the girls will scared and want to be our cabin. I'm starting to like you Trickster. What? I don't get it. Being in our cabins. Sleep in our beds Chicks man. Mmm... Candy. You'll think Lola would come? Why'd you care? I don't care. I was just...

Up and at them! Hit the deck. Let's roll! Bebe! You need to wake up! Ranger Bob! Your late! You suppose to be on your feet at 0700! I'm sorry, Ranger Bob. You do it again I'm gonna have to write you up! How late am I allowed to be? Bebe now! A total of 18 trails have to cleaned by the end of the week. Now, I'm gonna go look for Ty and Kiki. OK, you can make yourself some food, if you want but be sure to clean up afterwards. I'll be back as soon as I can. We need some firewood, if you work your way along the trail, you'll find plenty. Be sure to pick up trash as you go. and somebody let Scab know not to wander off on his own! We always travel in pairs! Trickster. You and Bebe can just continue to clean up, around here. Bebe... It's an oil tank. Wow, isn't that amazing? They knew exactly where to drill for oil. Even up here! Keep an eye on her. No problem. Just your eyes! You sound like money, Ryan Forbes III. So just how much money does your daddy have? I see somebody picking up trash. - You wanna come? - You wish! - Where's Scab? - That way. Are you drunk? I'm getting high. I wouldn't peg Ranger Bob for a whiskey drinker He's gonna be mad you went into his cabin and messed with his stuff! Big deal, what he's going to do? Scab... Huffing gas? Yeah. My best friend Randy OD on Pam. He ODed on a girl? No. No. Pam... It's a cooking spray. You take it in a paper towel a little and you pull it out and spray it in there and... .. and you'll fly. Isn't that bad for your lungs? Yeah. He's dead. So Bebe, What are you here? Did you sell your body like Candy? Shoplifting. But I didn't really do it! My friend put it in my bag and I really didn't really know. I'm gonna go drain the dragon. It's not really a real dragon. Trickster! You're a bear, man! You're a bear, man! I wanna try it on. Give me your head. Give me your head. Come on, give me your head. Give me. Give me. Did you hear that? Oh my God! What happened to the plan! - I'm gonna kill you. - I thought it was a bear! That what he had in his backpack the whole time. Brian, that wasn't the plan! I'm a good bear... Watch! Over here! Come on! Get the window! We're safe. You can't fit in there, it's too small! Lola is dead... We're gonna get out of here. You think he got Scab too? Better hope so. Otherwise he'll still gonna be hungry. Bebe. Shut up! Go check it out. Anything? It looks clear... I don't see anything. You're positive? Maybe he went after Lola and Scab? No! No! Ryan. No... Ryan! Ryan! Hold on! It's eating him. I don't hear him anymore. His hands are swollen. No, What are you doing? Help me Bebe! No... Bebe... Bebe... Ranger Bob... It's OK hunny. Are you OK? - I still need to go to the bathroom - Alright...

Blood was spreading! This guy's head was ripped off. Yeah! And I mean it's like survivor right? I won... I won... I'm the last person here! Except... Yeah... The ranger is such a dork! I fooled him from the beginning. I mean I could manipulated that bear if I wanted too. One of the girls had a gun in the backpack. Maybe I should shoot him? That could be kind of cool. Or I could just say I thought he was a bear. Yeah. Your right. I need to get down to the parking lot, to get out of here first. Yeah... I think I got to go now. But I will call you later OK? OK. See you soon. Bye... Tiffany Jones here, with a breaking news report, live from the woods. Butch Latham is still this at large in this bizarre killing spree, that has at least 9 adults murdered. including one park ranger, here at Grizzly Park. while doing community service. None of the 8 young adult survived the killings. Butch Latham has apparently hoodwinked authorities into believing that these were bear attacks. A bear costume has been found. Don't worry about me. I'll be back next year. Atta boy! Subtitle created by rackaboy@hotmail. com
