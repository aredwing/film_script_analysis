This data has to compute. Let's see. Independent variables. Unit analysis. It all adds up. Thought so. Hmm. What is this? Line up for inspection! That's better. Thank you. [LINE RINGS] Yes, I'd like a double extra-large pizza, please. Triple, Shaggy. Make that a triple extra-large pizza with peanut butter, potato chips, pickles... - And Scooby Snacks. - And Scooby Snacks. - Great call, Scoob. - Mm-hm. Mm-hm. How fast can you get here? [BELL DINGS] - Wow. Like, that is fast, Scoob. - Really fast. Hi. A yo-ho-hoo and a Pirate Pizza delivery for you. SHAGGY: Like, thanks, Stu. - And keep the change. - Unh! Ahoy, mateys. Enjoy. [GRUNTS] Like, voil. Ha, ha. - Pizza. - I'm starving. What kind? VELMA, DAPHNE & FRED: Ew. - Gross. - I'll pass. - Definitely pass. - Like, suit yourself. - Just more for me and Scoob. - Yeah, yeah. [SHAGGY GIGGLES] SHAGGY: Cheers, Scoob. SCOOBY: Cheers, Shaggy. The salty peanut-butter taste really complements the other flavors nicely, Scoob. Hmm? SHAGGY: Hey, it sort of looks like an old treasure map. SCOOBY: Treasure map? Like, we didn't order any treasure map in our pizza. Let me see. Wow! This map is said to lead to the fortune of Gnarlybeard the pirate. Like, who's Gnarlybeard the pirate? He was a villainous scalawag who sailed the seas a long time ago. Start flashback, please. Gnarlybeard the pirate sailed the seven seas, conquering, pillaging... ...and looting for years with his maniacal sidekick, Ye Phantom Parrot. SHAGGY: Phantom? VELMA: A huge, menacing parrot with a terrifying squawk. [SQUAWKS] VELMA: Gnarlybeard the pirate was equally as frightening. Gnarlybeard's beard was so nasty and nauseating... ...that its foul stench would knock people unconscious... ...so he could steal from them. As they sailed away you could hear Ye Phantom Parrot's creepy bird call... ...echoing through the night. And it is said that his biggest treasure was never found. Until now, gang. This map leads to that treasure. I wonder what's in it? Diamonds? Emeralds? Scooby Snacks? [BELL DINGS] GANG: Huh? [SQUAWKS] [ALL SCREAM] [GRUNTING] [SQUAWKS] [BOTH SCREAM] [SQUAWKS] [VELMA & DAPHNE GASP] He's got the map. I'm going in. Give me back that map, buster. [SQUAWKS] [GRUNTS] Huh? Hey, bird brain. Look what you did to our wall. - We've gotta get that map back. - It's the only way to find the treasure. [BOTH WHIMPERING] Come on, guys. We've got a bird to follow. Like, one time, Velma, I'd love to hear you say: "Let's stay here and eat some grub and chill out." - Me too. SHAGGY: Whoa! VELMA: These footprints are most definitely the parrot's. There is absolutely no doubt about it. See, three digits pointing forward, the hallux pointing to the back. I'd rather my footprints be pointing back to the clubhouse, Scoob. SCOOBY: Me too. SHAGGY: Ha, ha. Keep your eyes and ears open for any sign of the parrot. - Like, what did she say, Scoob? - Shaggy? Shaggy? [BOTH LAUGH] Come on, you guys. Stop goofing around. We gotta find other clues. Uh, we sure do, especially since the footprints stop here. Impossible. Footprints don't just disappear. Let me have a look. Hmm. It looks to me like the footprints have disappeared. - Brilliant deduction, Fredward. - Why, thank you. Well, looks like the bird flew the coop, gang. Oh, well, we tried. Ah! Ew! What's that? Jinkies, it's a clue. Is it, like, blood? [BOTH WHIMPERING] No, it's not blood, you scaredy-cats. BOTH: Meow. Meow. Meow. I need to get this analyzed right away. Take this to the lab, Dewayne. Well, it looks like Ye Phantom Parrot went in there. Step aside, gang. I'll take the lead here. Follow me. [THUD] DAPHNE: Freddy! - Just watch out for that first cave wall. It hurts. [VELMA SIGHS] - After you, Scoob. - After you, Shaggy. - No, no, no, after you. - After you, Shaggy. - No, I insist. - After-after you, Shaggy. VELMA: Come on, you wimps. SCOOBY: Oh! - Like, stay close, Scoob. - I will. I will. [SCREAMS] What? Is it Ye Phantom Parrot? No. I just got my shoes dirty. And they're my favs. [DAPHNE SIGHS] Hey, more of these red splotches. What are they? [WHEEZING NEARBY] And what's that noise? And what's that thing? [DAPHNE GASPS] [SHAGGY WHIMPERS] It's Ye Phantom Parrot! [BOTH WHIMPERING] Huh? I am Dr. Escobar, world-famous archeologist. What are you doing here? - Well, uh, you see, I... They... Uh, that is, we. - Hello. - Hello. - Hmph! Shirley, these youngsters are trying to steal... ...my most important archeological discovery ever. - Really? - Like, no, we're not. Mm-mm. We're here looking for something else, sir. I mean, ma'am, promise. - Mm-hm. Mm-hm. - Okay. Just one word of advice, then. [BOTH GULP] Stay out of my way in this cave! [SCOOBY WHIMPERING] "Stay out of my way in this cave." That's way more than one word. - That's more like seven. - Actually eight. ESCOBAR: Shirley! - Bye-bye. That Dr. Escobar wasn't so nice. No, but that Shirley sure was cute, and her perfume smelled terrific. - Freddy! - What? We need to get back to why we're here: To find Ye Phantom Parrot. VELMA: Mm-hm. - Yes. [STAMMERS] I don't think we need to find him anymore. ALL: Why? Because Ye Phantom Parrot found us. [SQUAWKS] ALL: Run! Shh. Shh. Shh. [SQUAWKS] [SHADOW ROARS] [PARROT SCREAMS] [BOTH GIGGLING] [ALL PANTING] Like, I think we lost that beefed-up bird. Yeah, but we lost the map again. Jinkies. What is it, Velma? VELMA: Look, I found another clue, a bicycle. - Like, what's that doing here? - I don't know. Guys, guys, guys. I think I see a way out. Look. SHAGGY: The faster I get out of this creepy cave, the better. Come on. [PARROT SQUAWKS IN DISTANCE] Looks like we're not getting out of here any time soon. [ALL SIGH] Wait, let me see. Hmm. Nope, looks like we're not getting out of here any time soon. - Thank you for that observation. - You're welcome. [SCOOBY SIGHS] - Push, Scooby! Push. - I am. I am. Heads up, gang. I'll get us out of this. Twenty-four, six, blue 72. BOTH [CHANTING]: Freddy. Freddy. Freddy. - Freddy. Freddy. Freddy. - Green 24, hike, hike, hike. [GRUNTS] Touchdown. There's no other way out of here. [BOTH SOBBING] Like, I don't wanna be stuck in here forever. There's nothing to eat in here. [BOTH SOBBING] But, Scooby, there is one thing to eat in here. How about busting us out of here for a Scooby Snack? Scooby Snacks. Yeah, yeah, yeah! DAPHNE: Catch. [GRUNTS] Scooby-Dooby-Doo! DAPHNE: Yeah, Scooby! FRED: Scooby ball. I hope I brought my A game. Unh. No gutter ball. [GIGGLES] Strike! Ha, ha! FRED: Yes! DAPHNE: Way to go, Scoob. Way to go, Scooby. [PARROT SQUAWKS IN DISTANCE] ALL: Huh? - The parrot. He went into that old abandoned creepy scary run-down lighthouse. Come on. - Like, hello? - Hello? Golly, looks like no one's been in here for ages. Or cleaned this place. What a dump. Jinkies. Another clue. This telescope is new. Everything else here is old. And these glasses are next to it. - They're so small. - And so out of style. Ew. Hey, you kids. What are you doing here? [STAMMERS] Uh, nothing. I... That is, I... - We, um... - Allow me. Ahem. Mr. Lighthouse-Man, of course there's a perfectly reasonable explanation... ...for why we're here. You see, a giant evil parrot... ...stole our treasure map, and so we followed him into your lighthouse. You're looking for the giant evil parrot, huh? Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. You are a sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Have you seen him? - Green feller? - Eye patch? Hook wing? ALL: Yes. Never seen him. [ALL SIGH] But I did hear a loud squawk a little while ago... ...coming from the top of the lighthouse. Top of the lighthouse? Gulp. No one's been up there for years. SHAGGY: Double gulp. VELMA: Whoa. Look how far up it goes. SHAGGY: Triple gulp! DAPHNE: Hey, where'd the lighthouse guy go? He was here till we all looked up. Hey, Mr. Lighthouse-Ma'am? I mean man. Where are you, Mr. Lighthouse-Man? [PARROT SQUAWKS & GANG GASPS] It's the Phantom Parrot. He's up there. Well, gang, it's been a blast. - We gotta go, right, Scoob? Come on. - Bye-bye. No, no, no. You two aren't going anywhere. - And besides, I believe I solved the mystery. - Huh? But first we have to catch the Phantom Parrot. Can't we just leave and go home? Please? Pretty please? Nope. We've got to catch ourselves a bird. - I thought you'd say that. - And I have a plan. - Shaggy, you're a big part of this. - And I thought you'd say that too. Huddle. Okay, what's the plan? I've been a lot of things before, but I've never been a giant cracker. Parrots love crackers. You ever heard of "Polly want a cracker"? Polly want a cracker, yeah. It's the only way to lure the parrot out. Then it'll chase you. And we'll catch it. It all sounds so easy, but it's my skinny neck on the line. [WHIMPERING] Here, parrot, parrot, parrot. Here, parrot. Oh, Phantom Parrot! Phantom Parrot want a cracker? I'm not Shaggy. I'm a cracker. A delicious salty, crispy cracker. [SHAGGY WHIMPERS] Here, Phantom Parrot. [PARROT SQUAWKS & SHAGGY GASPS] [WHIMPERING] [PARROT SQUAWKS] I'm a cracker, Mr. Parrot. I'm not Shaggy. I'm a delicious salty cracker. Huh? A delicious salty cracker? Yum. Like, this is good. I can see why Polly always wants a cracker. Ha, ha. Tastes pretty good, huh? Aah! [PARROT SQUAWKING & SHAGGY SCREAMING] [EASY-LISTENING MUSIC PLAYING] [PARROT SQUAWKING & SHAGGY SCREAMING] SHAGGY: He's so fast! [WHIMPERING] Please, spare me. Guys. Birdy. Nice birdy. Nice birdy. [PARROT SQUAWKING] [SCREAMING] [SQUAWKING] ALL: Gotcha! I think I laid an egg, gang. DAPHNE & FRED: We got him. Now it's time to solve the mystery and show who the Phantom Parrot really is. - Mr. Lighthouse-Man? - Dr. Escobar? Nope. It's... [GRUNTS] GANG: Pizza delivery boy Stu? - Yeah. FRED: How'd you know, Velma? Well, those red splotches turned out to be pizza sauce from Stu's pizzas. And that bicycle was Stu's delivery bike. [SPITS THEN SCOFFS] VELMA: And those glasses and telescope were Stu's too. And that pirate map is mine. Ugh. It accidentally fell into your pizza when we were cooking it. Like, finders keepers, man. No, the map's mine and so is the treasure. I'm the great-great-great-great-great-grandkid of Gnarlybeard the pirate maybe. So you created the Phantom Parrot to scare everyone off so you could find the treasure. Sure did, and I would've got away with it if not for you meddling kids. But you're, like, a kid too, Stu. - And kind of meddling. - True. [SCOFFS] Now let me out of this cage, man. Unh! Come on, I'm not... I'm not playing here. [ALL SIGH] It's too bad the map led to the lighthouse but no treasure. The treasure's gotta be out there somewhere. VELMA: Hmm. Like, all I know is I've got my own treasure right here. [PARROT SQUAWKS] Like, Ye Phantom Parrot's back! [SQUAWKING] [SCOOBY GIGGLING] [GRUNTS] Scooby-Dooby-Doo! MAN [ON TV]: Weather will remain sunny... ...which means the Coolsville Mayoral Race is up for grabs. In other news, it's the final delivery for pizza delivery boy Stu Stukowski. - Hey, it's about Stu. - I wonder if he'll mention us. Stu was arrested for dressing up like a crazed 7-foot green bird... ...while hunting for Gnarlybeard's treasure. - But the map didn't lead to any treasure. I wonder if there even is a treasure. Of course there's a treasure! And it's still out there! [DAPHNE & FRED GASP] VELMA: Jinkies, he's right. I've got big news, everyone. DAPHNE & FRED: What? - The most important part of... Ahh. Scooby, Shaggy. Wake up! - Hey. - We're up. We're up. We're up. The most important part of Gnarlybeard's map is missing. - That's why it didn't lead to any treasure. - What are you talking about, Velma? This corner here is gone, which would show exactly where X marks the spot. I don't like where this is going, Scoob. Come on. Hmm. And the missing piece kind of looks like someone took a bite out of it. Someone did. Scooby. - Me? - You accidentally ate it with the pizza. SCOOBY: Hmm. [GIGGLES] This x-ray machine should give us some insight. See? There it is. SHAGGY: Like, how'd it taste, Scoob? - Not bad. [BOTH LAUGH] VELMA: Jinkies. We now have the complete treasure map and the exact location of "X marks the spot." Look. DAPHNE: So the X wasn't in the creepy old abandoned lighthouse. Nope. According to the map, it's up on the creepy old abandoned bluff. Like, no way. If it's creepy, you can count us out. - Me too. - Shaggy, we have to go for the treasure now. Yeah, come on. Ahem. Guys? Like, I have a bad feeling about this, Scoob. Me too, Shaggy. [SIGHS] VELMA: This printout of the complete map should do the trick. Come on, guys, the bluff is this way. [SCREAMING IN DISTANCE] Like, what was that? [SCREAMING CONTINUES] - And that? - I don't know. But I do know someone's coming. Hide. Come along, Shirley. There's no time to waste. - Coming. - Ugh. It's got to be around here somewhere. We can't let anyone find it before we do. Okay. [ESCOBAR COUGHS] It was that meanie Dr. Escobar. And that cutie Shirley. Gosh, she smells terrific. - Freddy! - Hmm? MAN: Hot dogs. Get your red-hots. Speaking of smelling terrific, how about those hot dogs? Yeah. [BOTH SNIFFING] - Scooby? - Shaggy? We've got a mystery to solve. MAN: Hot dogs here. Get your red-hots. Hot dogs here. Get your red-hots. Get... Oh. - Hey, we'd like a hot dog or two. - Or three. Whoa. You got it, sonny. I just served another kid. What's going on around here tonight, some kind of kid convention? Ha, ha! Nope, just mystery solving. And mysteries sure make us hungry, right, Scoob? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Whoa. Say, you're not one of them looking for Gnarlybeard's treasure, are you? Well, like, yeah, we are. Well, I've seen many try to find the treasure, never to be heard from again. [BOTH GULP] That treasure is cursed. Cursed, I tell you. Cursed! [SHAGGY & SCOOBY WHIMPERING] Here's your hot dogs. Enjoy. [SHAGGY & SCOOBY SCREAMING] Huh. I wonder what scared them away. Huh. Oh, well. Hot dogs. Get your hot dogs here. Hot dogs. DAPHNE: According to the map... ..."X marks the spot" should be right around here somewhere. Yep, but more precisely, the X is located exactly 13 steps from the lighthouse. - There's this creepy hot-dog guy. - Yeah. He said the treasure is cursed and people disappear... - Shaggy, we don't have time for that now. - But... But... But... But nothing. We've gotta find "X marks the spot." Hmm. Hey, I found something, gang. It's a compass. Jinkies, it's a clue. And look. It has the initials D.E. On it. Hmm. Hey, everyone. I found something else. The X is right here, 13 steps from the lighthouse. SHAGGY: I don't see any X here or a treasure. SCOOBY: Me neither. Oh, well, can't say we didn't try. Come on, Scoob. Wait a minute. Don't you remember pirate movies? We have to dig at "X marks the spot" to find the treasure. [DOOR OPENS] ALL: Huh? - Shh. Someone's coming. Hide. It's the lighthouse guy. I have a bad feeling about him. - Let's follow him. - And you two can start digging. FRED: Mm. Shaggy, take this map till we get back. You might need it. But... But... How come you and me always get stuck doing the dirty work? - No fair. - I guess we better start digging, you dig? Yeah. - Huh? - What is it, Scoob? Zoinks! It really is an X. Weird. [X BEEPING] SCOOBY: Huh? - Huh? A glowing X? - Even weirder. - Mm-hm. X: Stand on ye X, be ready for flight. Ye treasure will soon be in your sight. A glowing, talking X? Forget weird. This is creepy. Mm-hm. X: Stand on ye X, be ready for flight. Ye treasure will soon be in your sight. BOTH: Stand on ye X, be ready for flight. Ye treasure will soon be in your sight? [BOTH YELLING] [BOTH YELLING] [BOTH GRUNT] It's a good thing this pirate ship broke our fall, huh, Scoob? Yeah. Like, whoa. Something smells totally gross. - Really gnarly smelling. - Mm-hm. SHAGGY & SCOOBY: Gnarly? Zoinks, are you thinking what I'm thinking, Scoob? [SHAGGY & SCOOBY WHIMPER] Argh! It's the ghost of Gnarlybeard the pirate! Argh! [SHAGGY WHIMPERS] He stinks! He smells so bad! Yuck! FRED: Scooby! Shaggy! VELMA: We have to save them. - But that ghost ship is sailing away so fast. That is a most accurate statement, Daphne. With the wind blowing at 43 miles per hour from the southwest... ...and a steady barometer, that ship is sailing away at 94 knots. Total bummer, Velma. - How are we gonna catch them? - We need something speedy and aerodynamic. DAPHNE: Something like this? FRED: Yes, Daphne, something just like that. A plane? Out here? Where'd you find that? My father. He has our planes parked all over the world. - That is one smart man. - And I'm assuming you can drive? Of course. I've been taking flying lessons with my dad forever. I fly his private jet all the time. Hop in. - Okay. - I don't know about this. [GRUNTS] Soon I'll have me treasure back. [LAUGHING] [ALL LAUGHING] Quiet, you scalawags. You're me pirate crew now. Swab your poop deck. Hoist your mizzenmast. Lower your anchor. Raise me expectations. And might I add, we can give that beard of yours a good wash too. - Hmm? - It really needs it. - Argh! - Yikes! [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [SCOOBY & SHAGGY GROANING] Argh! [GRUNTS] I can see the pirate ship. They must be heading for that island. Hold on. [ALARM BEEPING] Does anybody else hear beeping, or is it just me? DAPHNE: Uh, the control button is beeping. - Why is it beeping? - Who knows? I can only fly it. - I don't know how it works. - Oh, brother. Uh, now might be a good time to make sure your seat belts are tight across your laps... ...and your seats are in the upright position. VELMA & FRED: Uh-oh. Whew. I am pooped from swabbing the poop deck, Scoob. - And hungry. - Yeah. Let's see what kind of grub they have here in the galley. [SCREECHING] Ooh. I'm so hungry my stomach's growling. [SCREECHING] Oh! It's not my stomach that's making all that racket, it's this creepy ghost. [SHAGGY WHIMPERING] [MEOWS] SHAGGY: What do you know? It's a stowaway kitten. Like, what are you doing here? - Meow. SCOOBY & SHAGGY: Aw. - She likes you, Scoob. - Nice kitty. Well, there's no grub here on this ship. It... Wait, what's this? Mustard? There's nothing here but mustard. That's weird. CAT: Rawr! BOTH: Huh? - Kitty? - Like, where'd she go? - Must have been spooked out by something. - Uh-huh. GNARLYBEARD: Argh! BOTH: Aah! DAPHNE: I can't control it. Velma, does the flight manual say how to fix the plane? - I haven't found anything yet. - Ahh. Now, let me get this straight. If we lose control of the plane, it will plummet down... ...1000 feet into the ocean below? - Yes. - Got it. - We're about to go into a nose dive. You can find out for yourself. Hold on. - Will do! - Oh! I got it! We just have to fix the power-to-weight ratio on the crankcase... ...in connection with the gyroscopic effect power... ...on the scramjet's pulse detonation propeller. - Or maybe we just press the button? - Just press the button? That will never work. Let me see. - Hey, why don't you just press that button? - Okay. Just as I said. Yes! - Way to go, Fredward. - No problem. Okay, we have good weather and a strong tail wind. We should be at the island in no time. [SCOOBY WHIMPERING] Ye two are useless. Ye both are sentenced to walk ye plank. SCOOBY & SHAGGY: Gulp. - Now. Don't we get, like, one last request or something? Aye. Out with it so I can get out with you. How about one last meal? Aye. Fine. What will it be? Uh, Scooby Snack would be, like, super groovy cool, ma'am. I mean, sir. - Scooby Snack. Yeah. - All right. [GRUMBLES] Here, catch. [SCOOBY GIBBERING] Whoa, whoa, whoa! SCOOBY: Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Argh! Way to go, Scoob. Get back here and walk this plank. Traitors. Mutineers. Poopy-heads. Other way, Scoob. Turn around. [SCOOBY GIGGLES] I wonder if Scooby and Shaggy made it here yet. [AIR WHISTLING] Not quite yet. In three, two, one. [ALL GROANING] Like, super weird running into you guys here. Are you guys okay? We were so worried about you. - We sure showed that Gnarlybeard, huh? - Mm-hm. He's got nothing on us. - So, what about the map? - Okay, he did get that. Oh, great. So now Gnarlybeard is going to get to the treasure before we do. [SCRAPING NEARBY] - Hey, what's that sound? - Jinkies, it's a clue. Come on. - Lead the way. - We'll follow you. [SCRAPING CONTINUES] DAPHNE: It's Gnarlybeard digging. [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] Ah. At last! Me treasure! VELMA: Jinkies, I see another clue. SHAGGY: Clue, schmue, Velma. We're too late. Gnarlybeard's already found the treasure. We gotta stop him now. And I got a plan. Wait, does this plan involve me dressing up in a humiliating costume again? - Yep. SCOOBY: Ha-ha-ha. - And you're dressing up too, Scoob. - Rats. [GRUNTING] [SINGING] Aloha Aloha Welcome to the island, tall, stinky and smelly. - Welcome. Welcome. SHAGGY: And welcome again. Aloha. SCOOBY: Welcome. SHAGGY: Welcome. - How are you doing? SCOOBY: Welcome. SCOOBY & SHAGGY: We got him. [GNARLYBEARD GROWLING] [ALL YELLING] [SHAGGY & SCOOBY YELLING] - Here they come. - Ready, gang? Three, two, one. Pull. [SHAGGY SCREAMS] Argh! [LAUGHS] [GANG WHIMPERING] GNARLYBEARD: Ye know what I do with traitors. Argh! [LAUGHING] - En garde. - Freddy! - You don't bring a banana to a sword fight. - Huh? [FRED GASPS] [LAUGHS] [GIGGLES] [GROANS] ALL: Huh? - Like, great shot, Scoob. [SCOOBY GIGGLES] And now I'll show you who Gnarlybeard really is. [MEOWS] - It's the kitty from the galley. - My friend? - Huh? - It's not the kitty, you guys. - It's... - Oh, oh. Dr. Escobar. - The lighthouse guy? - No. It's... ...Shirley. - Hmph. Big wow. - How'd you know, Freddy? - Shirley's perfume. I'd never forget that smell. [FRED SNIFFS THEN SIGHS] - Freddy! - What? And there were other clues too. We found her compass with Dr. Escobar's initials on it. SHAGGY: And the mustard was a clue too. The vendor mentioned that he sold a hot dog to another kid. VELMA: And the final clue was Shirley's shovel. The sound was so familiar, and then there it was next to the treasure. Hmph. Double big wow. My brother Stu couldn't find the treasure, but I knew I could. You're, like, Stu's sister? Whoa. Yeah. Gnarlybeard was our great-great- great-great-great-great-grandfather maybe. I would've got away with taking that treasure if it wasn't for you meddling kids. - Like, you're like a kid too. - And meddling. ESCOBAR: She certainly is meddling. ALL: Huh? SHAGGY: Dr. Escobar? FRED: And the lighthouse guy. I knew you were no good, Shirley... ...and no thanks to you, I finally found my most important discovery. - My lovey-teddy. - Mm-hm. SHIRLEY: A teddy bear? That's what you were looking for the whole time? Yes. Louie gave it to me on our first date, and I lost it. Yeah. But now you found it there, little sugar-pants. Yes, I did. Thank heavens. [BOTH COOING] Gross. Speaking of treasure, what's inside the chest, everyone? - Diamonds? - Gold? Scooby Snacks? GANG: Huh? FRED: It's just a bunch of stuff for Gnarlybeard's beard. VELMA: Shampoo. Conditioner. SHAGGY: Brushes. Beard trimmers. All brand-new. Huh. No wonder his beard was so disgusting. He never washed or brushed it. Gross. What a waste of a treasure. I'm not so sure about that, Freddy. Right, Scoob? Yeah. Hee-hee. [POUNDING ON DOOR] FRED: Hey in there. I gotta go to the bathroom. VELMA: Me too. - Open up. DAPHNE: Come on, I have to brush my hair. VELMA, DAPHNE & FRED: Open up! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! [SCOOBY GIGGLES] [SHAGGY HUMMING] [English - US - SDH]
