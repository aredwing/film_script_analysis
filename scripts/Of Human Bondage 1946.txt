I live here with Flanagan. Where is he? At the ball. I've been looking at your studio. It's charming... The real Paris. Yes. I was introduced to Flanagan tonight at the ball. Because we were both Americans, He offered to take me under his wing. And he flew away. Yes, and quite unsteadily. I had rather a difficult time alone. It seemed my costume wasn't revealing enough for the natives, So they... They dumped me in the fountain. Ha ha! Did they really put you in a fountain? Mm-Hmm. Are you chilly? No. I'll get you a brandy. Thanks. One of the models did repent when she saw me laughing. She was able to induce the man with her to lend me these pants and shirt. It was all very cozy. Why was I chosen, do you think? Perhaps they felt you weren't one of them. How would they know? Well, you're not an artist or a model. They all know each other. This thing is strictly quartier Latin. But I suppose I am an artist in a way. I write books. You do, huh? Yes. Professionally? Certainly. How else would I write them? I don't know your name. Nora Nesbit. Oh. Oh, I write under the nom de plume of Courtney pageant. Now, don't say you've read any of my books. No, I haven't. I'm here looking for material. I could put you in my book quite easily, I think... Alone, a male Cinderella, seeming rather out of it in the dawn. Don't you ever dance? I have a clubfoot. Didn't you notice it? No, but I can see it now. May I have some more brandy? Of course. You're a very engaging lady. You're German, aren't you? No. My mother was Viennese. My father was an English doctor. He practiced in London. I was sent to school there. It was intended that I should become a doctor, too. But you preferred to paint. Can you paint? No. Is this yours? Oh, that? Flanagan's. He's brilliant. Where are yours? Mine? Here in this fire. I'm sure it's their best effect. They weren't meant to live. I am leaving for London. Back to London? Yes. I had just finished packing when you arrived. To be a doctor? To be a doctor. Well, need you? How do you know you're a failure? The great foinet told me yesterday afternoon. Foinet? Who's he? Would he really know? Possibly the best authority in Europe. He's my teacher... Or was, Until he found it useless to go on. And then Flanagan agreed with him. I'm very sorry. I would have been willing to live in poverty If I could produce anything worthwhile. Have you money? No. Only some money in a trust fund for a medical education. It's controlled by an uncle Who believes that painting is disreputable And that Paris is a sink of iniquity. Are you in love with anyone? No. Haven't you ever been? No. Have you? Yes. My husband died. I've always had the fear that love would pass me by. I've longed and waited For a passion to sweep me off my feet. Do you understand me? I'm in love with love. Well, I hope this overwhelming passion comes to you. I'm sure it will save you a lot of wretchedness. In London? A poor medical student at st. Luke's hospital? You tell Mrs. Gray I want a fire in my room, Or I'll burn every stick of furniture in it. I've a fire in here. Come in. Go on. You're very kind, Carey, but I've made other arrangements. Oh, yes, of course. By the way, what happened to you this afternoon? Dr. Tyrell was asking for you. I came back here to read up on anatomy. It's quieter, you know. You'd have learned more with us in the dissecting room. I don't know, though... A nice, warm fire on a nice, wet day? You, uh, you sure you were only reading up on anatomy, old boy? Come on. Where is she? No, I've been alone. I have a fair damsel coming here to tea. What time is it, Dunsford? About quarter past 5:00. Well, good-Bye, Carey. Good-Bye. Oh, Dunsford... Why don't you ask Carey's advice about that little matter you mentioned? Lay the matter squarely before him. Yes. Have a cup of tea. I say, you must be frightfully keen on medicine To stay in cramming so much. Well, I've a lot to catch up. I started rather late, you know. Wasn't your father a doctor? Hmm, yes. So old Tyrell said, and a very fine one, too. You were doing anatomy this afternoon? Yes, but we're frightfully short on bodies, though. All I had was an arm to dissect. It was a male, though. Is a male better? Oh, yes. A female's likely to have too much fat on her. Say, talking about females... Carey, may I ask your advice about something? Oh, certainly. When you were in Paris, you must have met an awful lot of girls... I mean models and things. Oh, yes. Lots of them. Well, you painted them, didn't you? I mean, you were an artist. I thought I was an artist. Must have learned an awful lot about women. Well, you don't really know them. You sketch them or paint them... Or try to. Really? Carey... you know, lately, sort of a mild affair of the heart Has been encroaching itself upon me. See, with girls, I'm not quite as immediately flamboyant as I seem. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of slow and nervous at first. Do you understand what I mean? Oh, yes, of course. Oh, I'm sorry. I've forgotten the tea. I'm going to have a cup of tea, all right, but not here. Come along, my boy. That's just it. We're going out to tea. But it won't take a minute. Oh, no. Come on. I am going to show you this girl in person. Say, it may be fun at that. Have a seat, old boy. Well, here we are. Are you meeting her here? You wait. Oh, uh... Oh, waitress? Yes? Good afternoon. Tea and scones, please, as usual. And you? Same, please. Well, what do you think? What? Hasn't she got a ripping face? The waitress? Mmm. She looks anemic. You know, I told you I was a bit shy at first. Now, all I want is a lead, And from then on, I can carry on myself. Yes, of course. Do you know that I've been here about a dozen times, And she always behaves like that? - Sort of insolent. - Yes. It can be melted down, though, because I've seen her laughing with the other girls. She's laughing now. Look. Oh, that chap. Ha ha ha! Hot water and two tea and some scones. - Two? - Mm Hmm. What's the joke, Mildred? Oh, he's a caution. I'll have your hot water in a moment. Thank you. That must have been very funny. Was it? You talkin' to me? That joke your noble friend over there was telling you. Must have been very funny. I don't know what you mean. I'm sure no ordinary customer could make you laugh like that. He must be quite a friend. Some people would do better to mind their own business. You put her back up. I'm indifferent of the attitude of her vertebrae. She's rude and common. Oh, don't let it upset you. Oh, waitress? Yes, sir? Well, uh... Oh! The bill, please. Are we no longer on speaking terms? I have to take orders and wait on customers. I've got nothin' to say to them, and I don't want them to say anything to me. Well, that's one in the eye for you, Carey. I wish she would say something a little cheeky So that I can report her and have her sacked. She's an ill-Mannered wench. Are you leaving? Yes. I shan't come here again. Huh. Don't think I will, either. It's hardly worth it. If she had treated me with civility the day before, I would have been indifferent to her, But my pride was wounded. I felt I could have no peace until I had seen her again and humbled her. It was a strange anguish I had never known before. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Filthy weather, isn't it? Can't make much difference to me what the weather is, Having to stay here all day. That's very true. If you'll kindly give me your order, I can't stand here talking all night. Oh, anything. A cup of tea. Oh, I say... wait a minute. Look at this. What's that supposed to be? Well, look. I drew it from memory last night. She's got a cap and apron on. Is that supposed to be me? Do you like it? I didn't know you could draw. I thought you was a medical student. I was an art student in Paris for two years. Now you're cutting people up. You may keep it if you like. It's no use to me. Could I have a look at the picture you done of miss Rogers? Is that her name? Miss Rogers? Mildred, yes. Mister, it's the living image of her! Could you do one of me? Don't you do it. They'll all be wanting you to do them. Thank you, Mildred. Oh. I see you know my name. It happens to be miss Rogers. You're not a bad sort, really, miss Rogers. Who said I was? Good afternoon, Mr. Miller. Would you dine with me one night? Why? Oh, I don't know. We... We could dine, And I will take you to see the belle of new York. Belle of new York? Yes, or anything else you'd like to see. I'd get a couple of stalls. Will you come? I don't mind. When? When will you come? I get off early on Tuesdays. This Tuesday? I don't mind. I'll get us stalls. Stalls. That'd mean evening dress. Oh, no. Anything you'd like to wear. Well, I've got one! Good. Wear it. I have to go home to put it on, though. Where? Hern hill. What about dinner? I can get a bite at home. All right. We'll have supper then. I'll have to get the 11:25 train. I have to get up in the morning. Oh, we'll see. No, we won't. Suppers make you dream. Do they? The manageress is staring right at me. I've got to go now. Going back to your laughing friend? If I met you at the theater, would it be convenient? Convenient? Of course. The Shaftesbury? The Shaftesbury theatre Tuesday. Buttered scone. Are you enjoying it? The belle of new York? Well, I've seen it 7 times, And I could go 7 times more. My sides always ache from laughing so much. I didn't know you'd seen it before. I could have taken you to a play. I said I could see it again and again. Besides, I don't like plays. Oh, more champagne. You are going it, aren't you? Do you like fizz? Oh, I don't mind. A long life. Ha ha! Not too long, I hope. Never want to look like some of these old women around here. It's disgusting, these west end people with all their false hair. Well, perhaps it isn't all false. Mine's all my own, every bit of it. I'm sure it is. You get to know some things about life working in a shop like I do. I'm sure you do. My family's very well-Connected. Of course. Ha ha! What are you laughing at? Don't you believe I'm telling you the truth? Of course I do. You say that as though you was leading me on. I'm sorry. You needn't be. I don't pretend to know all about everything. I know one thing, though... The moment you came into the shop, I knew you was a gentleman in every sense of the word. Really? The moment you see a man, He's either a gentleman in every sense of the word or he's not, And that's all there is to it. I suppose that's very true. I say... may I call you Mildred? I don't mind. Mildred. Come on. It'll be nice to start laughing again. I think we ought to go. Come on, then. I said there's no need to come down. I've got to hurry, or it'll mean standing all the way. Will you come out again with me one night? I don't mind. It sounds as if you didn't care much whether you came or not. If you don't take me out, some other fellow will. I've got to go now. Let me kiss you good night. What do you think I am? With all these people around? They would think I'd known you for a long time. Well, they're not going to get the chance. I've got to go. I've had quite a nice time. Don't spoil it all. Good night. Good night, Mildred. Hello, Mildred. Don't call me Mildred in the shop. Very well, miss Rogers. Or that, either. I'm just a waitress here. Yes, miss. I was wondering about your friend. What friend? That laughing fellow... The one you had such a joke with. Oh, Mr. Miller. He's from Birmingham. He's in business there. Only gets up to London every now and again. He's gone back to Birmingham? I expect he has. I haven't seen him around. Is he in love with you? Better ask him. I don't know what it's got to do with you if he is. When will you come to the theater with me again? You don't seem to have much to do with your time. Saturday. Say you'll come. Oh, I don't mind. Oh, say you'd like to. Why? I don't know. Will Saturday night suit you? I don't get off early on Saturdays. I'd have to bring my dress up to the shop in the morning with me and change here. Splendid! Saturday night. I'll be waiting outside for you. I'll count the days. Today's Wednesday. It'll be 3 days. Until Saturday, Mildred... Miss. Good evening. Has miss Rogers gone? Miss Rogers? Oh, she's inside, Just changing her dress. Thank you very much. Oh, here you are. Yes. I have the seats. They're the best in the house. You do look nice this evening. Don't! I didn't know where to find you. I hadn't got your address. Did you want to find me? Well, naturally. I wanted to save you the trouble Of getting the stalls and coming for me. Oh. My aunt's sick. I have to go back and stay with her, So I shan't be able to come tonight after all. You don't have to look like that about it! It's not my fault, after all. No. Well, I can see you home, anyway. But you got the tickets. You can't waste them, silly. I'm not going without you. Well, you're not going to see me home, if that's what you mean. You've made other arrangements? No! Did you have to change your clothes To go back home to your aunt? She was taken ill after I left this morning. How did she let you know? She sent me a note! By Mr. Miller, your laughing friend... Oh, go away and let me alone! Certainly. You're spying on me, you dirty cad! I thought you was a gentleman! Did you think a gentleman Would be likely to take an interest in you? I'm not obliged to come out with you! I tell you I'm going home, and I won't be followed or spied on! Mr. Miller is keeping you waiting, I'm afraid. Is he? Well, I'd rather wait for him than have you wait for me. Put that in your pipe and smoke it! Go off home and mind your own business and let me alone! Mildred. Won't you change your mind? I was looking forward to this evening so much. Come with me. We'll go anywhere you like. When I make up my mind, I keep to it. I can't go on like this. If I go now, I go for good. Oh, really? Well, all I can say is good riddance to bad rubbish. Pardon me. In the weeks that followed, I tried to get her out of my mind, but it was impossible. I hated myself for loving her. Carey, the doctor wants you to wait. What's the matter? Are you ill? You'd better wait, old man. Carey... Doctor, what about the other woman? I'll examine her later. Yes, doctor. Carey. Carey! What's the matter, Carey? I don't know. Of course you must know. Are you drinking? No. No, I'm not. Are you eating and sleeping well? No. Well, I would say you might easily experience a nervous collapse. I've noticed it for the past month, and so have others. One of the primary requirements for a man of medicine, Carey, Is a strong, objective viewpoint. But you're shaky, subjective, uncertain. You can't go on like that, can you? I know. I've been conscious of that. Another thing to remember: You'll never pass your conjoint examination at this rate. If I remember rightly, I understood you to say that the money at your disposal Would only last for the prescribed time. Isn't that so? Yes. You started out so well. I would suggest a sedative and some sleep. All right. Go along. See you tomorrow. Yes, doctor. We're a little full up for lunch, sir. Would you care to share a table with a gentleman? Where's Mildred Rogers? Oh, she's left. Gone home? That I couldn't say. She's been left here about 6 weeks at least, I would say. Oh. Anything wrong? I wonder if you would be kind enough to give me her address. She lived somewhere in Hern hill. I would be so much obliged. I think I have it in the desk if you'll come this way. Hello, Carey. Our patient's taken a turn for the better. I hope you don't think we were intruding, Carey. We were a bit anxious about you. Whiskey and soda? Certainly. Carey, you present the appearance of a man who has something to tell. May we know the reason for this sudden outburst of sunshine, Or would we be presuming? On the contrary, I shall ask you to share my good fortune. But first let me ask you to drink to my future As a doctor from now on. I'm going to write dr. Tyrell a letter today. If I ever told him the absurd story, He would have me committed to an asylum immediately. I'll drink to all you wish, Carey, old boy. And may you never again be as near an asylum as you were today. Today and yesterday. Well, it must have been for fully two months. Come on, Carey, drink. Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Care to tell us? Yes. I fell in love. For the first time in my frustrated, inarticulate life, I fell desperately in love. Dunsford, do you remember Mildred Rogers? The waitress. Yes, that waitress, that ill-Mannered witch! You fell in love with her? That's impossible. I know. If it hadn't been for my vanity, I would never have bothered with the wretched girl at all. Sounds like a profound human experience, Carey. You should write it up from a pathological viewpoint. Or forget about it. Precisely. It was a lesson. It was? Yes, oh, yes. She happens at this moment to be bound in holy matrimony To a bounder who, if looks mean anything, Is equally low-Bred. And they both reside in Birmingham. Good for little Millie. Good for little Mildred. She was an obsession, a bondage. I scarcely knew her. Almost immediately, She became a parasite in my blood. I couldn't eat. I didn't sleep. It was madness. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, old boy. I brought them over from the hospital. They were addressed there. This letter came with it. A nice bold woman's handwriting. Nora Nesbit. Oh, she's charming! I'll see her. She's a novelist. It's such fun. This was the beginning for me Of a happiness I had never thought possible. Nora and I became great friends. Nora? Philip, will you put some water in the tea? Be sure it's boiling. All right. Are you sure it's boiling? Oh, yes. I remember last time. Run along. I'll do it. You look tired. Oh! Roses in November? 10 shillings. Shall I put them into water? No. I'll do it. Come have your tea. Oh, did you hear about the examinations? I failed again. All 3? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry. Are you crying? Nora, don't. I was playing a joke on you. I've passed the conjoined examinations. Please! Oh, I'm such a fool. I don't know why I thought it would be funny. My dear Nora, you must forgive me. Then you did pass? Of course. It wasn't a kind joke, but I'm very pleased. Whenever I try to be funny or play a joke, I fail. I suppose I was born that way. I'm not really a funny man. Thank you, Nora. You were born with so much more than so many other men. I wonder. And you must stop being sensitive about your club foot. What? People only notice it the first time they see you, And then they forget about it, as you must. Yes. Oh, don't be angry. I'm not. I only mentioned it because I, well, Because I'm so fond of you, I suppose. You can say anything you choose to me, I'm so grateful to you. You know you could make me do anything. Well, I want you to go away and take a vacation. You said you could after your examinations. Why, are you tired of me? Of course not, silly, but you've worked hard, and you look tired. You need fresh air and a rest. You see, doctor? Yes, Nora. Did you know you're dining out tonight? Really? Where? At the Adelphi. Adelphi? Why? I told you this was the beginning of your vacation. You're dining with a friend. A friend? Someone who loves you very much. Someone who loves me? Who can that be? You'll see. Did you read the last chapters of my book? I did. They're so much improved. You didn't bring my manuscript back. I need it in the morning. You'll get it tonight. It's on my desk. The next book I write is going to be about society... England, London... And success. He's a young doctor. He's brilliant. He finally arrives in Hartley street. Oh, in the beginning, he has a rotten time, But later, he's knighted. Oh, really? He must be an exceptional man for that. He is. I drink to you, sir Philip Carey. No. That will never be for me. It does seem a pity you had to waste those two years painting in Paris. Waste?! Have you ever watched the movements of children playing? Have you ever watched the patterns the sun makes on the ground, Shining through the trees? Have you ever watched a sky? I should never have seen the sky If I hadn't been to Paris. I understand you. For months, I have been starved for beauty. We can call at my rooms on the way back And pick up the last chapters of your book. Fancy your remembering. You're very thoughtful, Philip. Mr. Carey, there's someone in your room, A young lady. Why did you let her in if you knew I wasn't home? I shouldn't have, I know, but she's been here 3 times. Shh. I'm sorry. She's that upset at not finding you. Will you please try to get rid of her? Say I'm not coming back tonight, anything. What if she won't go? She looks a very determined young person. Get the police if you have to. Wait, please. I'm not coming up, Nora. Did I do or say anything to offend you tonight? I'm worried. I think I did. Of course not. I'll come in tomorrow. All right. Good night, Philip. Good night. And the key? Good night, Nora. What do you want? I didn't think I would ever see you again. He's left me. Who? Emil. Mr. Miller. Miller? That night I was to go out with you, I went with him instead, And he asked me to marry him. He had 7.00 a week in prospects, And he said we needn't wait. We could be married in a registry office. Go on. What happened to you? I can't tell you. You were married. You were living in Birmingham. No. I was here in London, But last Monday, he went up to Birmingham, And he promised he'd be back by Thursday, And he never came back. And he didn't come on Friday. So I wrote to ask him what was the matter, And he never answered the letter! Then I wrote and said if I didn't hear from him by return, I was going up to Birmingham. And this morning, I got a solicitor's letter To say I had no claim on him! And if I molested him, he'd ask the protection of the law! You'd had a row? Oh, yes. We'd had a quarrel on the Sunday, And he'd said he was sick of me. But he'd said it before, and he'd come back all right. That's what made me think he didn't mean it. Go on. He was frightened. Why was he frightened? Because I told him a baby was coming. And was it? Or rather, is it? Yes. I kept it from him as long as I could. Then I had to tell him. If you had only heard the things he said to me. I found out precious quick he was no gentleman! He left me without a penny. He hadn't paid my rent, And I haven't got the money to pay it! I wouldn't go back to him now, Not even if he was to come and ask me on his bended knees. And he wasn't getting the money he said he was! The lies he told me! You want me to go to Birmingham and see what I can do? No. He'll never come back now. I know him. But he's got to provide for you. He's your husband, isn't he? He didn't marry me. He couldn't. He had a wife already. Then what made you go away with him? Oh, I don't know. He made me laugh. That could have been it. I'd like to help you. I'm going to. You mustn't think I'm not grateful. You're a good friend, Philip. What? I called you Philip. May I? Yes. You have no money? I can give you some to go on with until we can see Miller. I wouldn't take a penny from you! I'd rather starve! I've got my pride to consider! You have to think of your health, don't you? Now? Yes, I suppose I do now. I think I can let you have all you'll need until the baby. I somehow knew I could depend on you. This should carry you along for the present. You must go now. Where do you live? It is late. It's all the way over to highbury. You may stay here. Philip, I can't take your bed. I have a fellow student who lives upstairs. He'll let me sleep on his sofa. You see what I mean, Nora? So you've taken rooms for her In the Vauxhall bridge road? Yes. Why? She's going to have a child. Yours? No, but she needs help. And that's why you didn't answer my telegram? I couldn't help it, Nora. There's nothing else. Then how could you love me? I didn't! Forgive me, Nora. I can't help it. Even though I've despised her, I've yearned for her madly. Can there be a greater torture in the world Than to love and at the same time to condemn? Nora, she's in my blood. I never thought ours would come to an end without any fault of mine at all. If you want men to behave well to you, you must be beastly to them. If you treat them decently, they make you suffer for it! They... If you don't mind, I think I'll walk on alone. I'm afraid I'm going to weep. I can't very well go along crying, can I? Bless you. Driver. Don't hurry, Mildred, if you're resting. It's all right. I'm up now. I was dreaming, and then I woke up. I was lying there thinking, and... And I got afraid. Afraid? Yes, and I wished you'd hurry up. And I thought I heard your voice, And then I thought I was dreaming again, and then it was you. What made you afraid? What? Afraid I should die from it. After all, I'm not the first one to have a baby, am I? Sit down. Don't break it. Oh, Philip, the doctor says his charge will be 15 guineas. Is that too much, do you think? You're a doctor yourself, or nearly one. If you're happy and comfortable, I don't mind a bit about the expense. You can't say I didn't offer to do anything in return. I don't want a return. You owe me nothing. I don't? But you've been so good to me. I want you to be happy, and I want you to be healthy. When the baby comes, I'm going to send you both to Brighton for some sea air. Would you like that? Brighton? Would you go? I can tell you now, I'm not going to keep the baby with me. I'm going to find someone to take care of it, And I'm going back to work at the tea shop. It'll be better for the baby and better for me. Let's talk about that when the baby comes, shall we? Oh, I feel a bit giddy. Here, come on! Remember, you had a child. About the baby, I don't feel like arguing any more about it. My mind's made up. But when you leave a baby with someone, How can you be sure they won't ill treat it? You're a funny old thing, Philip. You couldn't make more fuss if you was her father. After we are married, I'm going to bring her up as my own. There will be no yes or no about it. We are going to Paris for our honeymoon. Oh, no. That'd cost a lot of money. Money? I don't care. Think how long I've been looking forward to it. Don't you know what it means to me? I've never loved anyone but you and never shall. What you been doing in London since I been down here in Brighton? Getting through my exams. I know that, but evenings? Working. I dare not have failed. I couldn't have faced you. Did you go out with anyone? Griffiths. He lives upstairs. I told you about him. And I told him about you. He wants to know you. When I left, he sent you his love. What cheek. He's very flirtatious and amusing and quite handsome. I don't like good-Looking men. They're too conceited for me. Our train leaves in half an hour. And tonight I'm going to take you to a little Italian restaurant In Soho for dinner. We'd better go along then. And next week, we'll be in Paris. You do want to come, don't you? Of course I do. You don't know how I'm looking forward to it. I don't know how I'll get through the next days. I'm so afraid that something will happen to prevent it. Mildred. Yes? It maddens me sometimes That I can't tell you how much I love you. Come on. Waiter. Ha ha ha! I like it when you laugh. Oh, do you? Then I'll go on laughing. His teeth are very regular and white. Don't you think so, Philip? Yes, they are. When's the happy day to be, old boy? Next Tuesday. Then I drink to you both! Thank you, Harry. To long life and happiness. Mildred? I have a good mind not to! Why not? Well, he's scarcely tasted the port! But it's very good port. I believe in good port. It gives you confidence And courage. I'll say one thing. Philip told the truth. Of course. He always tells the truth. I mean about you. About me? What did you say about me to Mildred, old boy? I don't remember. You're calling me Mildred already. May I? Do you mind, old boy? I don't think she'll scratch your eyes out If you call her Mildred. Then she must call me Harry. Will you? I don't mind. What did the upright Philip say about Harry, huh? I don't think I can tell you now. It's embarrassing. Will you tell me Monday? Perhaps. Why don't you tell him what I said? All right. Well, he said you was amusing and handsome. Did you really, old boy? You're silly. Silly people amuse you, don't they? More than the serious ones sometimes. I'm just waiting for the change. Come on. We'd better go. My word, the evening's gone quickly. I thought it wasn't more than half past 9:00. You know, I'm quite tipsy from the port. Do you think you might be carried from the room? You look as though you'd be strong enough. I had a wonderful night. Harry! Shh! What's the matter, old boy? Don't take her away from me. Who, Mildred? Yes. She doesn't matter to you. You have so many women. She's my entire life. Well, my dear old fellow, I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. I'm far too fond of you for that. I was just playing the fool. Is that true? Of course. I don't care tuppence about her. I give you my word of honor, I don't. Good night, old boy. Sleep well. Hello, Philip. I like your new dress. It's very smart. I got the hat, too. It goes with it. Didn't cost much, and I like it. Do you mind? Of course not. Did Griffiths like it? Yes, he did. Where did you go? Up the west end to lunch. You seem to have enjoyed it. Yes, I did. I've got to have a little amusement sometimes. Yes. Of course you do. Mildred, don't take him too seriously. I asked him how he felt towards you. He said, "I don't care tuppence for her." Oh, really? Would you like to read a letter? No. "I couldn't sleep all night for thinking about you. I am a bit ashamed of myself because Philip is such a dear..." Stop it! It's nonsense! All right. Laugh. You're taking it pretty calmly, I must say. What should I do, tear my hair? He's jolly and amusing. He can talk about the things that interest you. What do you mean by that? If I'm not clever, I can't help it. But I'm not the fool you think I am, not by a long way. You're a bit too superior for me, my young friend. Oh, it's a silly infatuation. It can't last. Why can't it last? He never cares for anyone more than 10 days, And that sort of lovemaking Couldn't mean very much to you. That's what you think. Mildred, I've always known That you're not in love with me, That you liked me all right, But when we are married and get over to Paris, You'll forget about Griffiths. If you make up your mind now To put him out of your thoughts, You won't find it so difficult. I can't go away with you tomorrow. The doctor said I oughtn't to. That's a lie. I may as well tell you I can't come away with you at all. It is Griffiths. I can't help it if I'm in love with him. What's the good of marrying and going away? I'd be thinking of him all the time. And what fun would that be for you? That'll be my business. That's horrid. What of it? I thought you was a gentleman in every sense of the word. What do I care whether I'm a gentleman or not? If I were a gentleman, I wouldn't waste my time On anything as vulgar as you. I don't care whether you like me or not. You're coming to Paris with me tomorrow. I never liked you, not from the beginning. You forced yourself on me. Why, I wouldn't let you touch me now if I were starving. I can earn my own living! That's the best thing you can do. Good morning, sir. Hey! How are you today, Mr. Perkins? Yes, sir. Good morning. Good morning. Tell him about the billiards. He wants to play billiards. All right. We'll play a game of billiards one day. Yes. This is unmistakably gout, And there is no more painful clinical condition Than an acute attack of gout. Ouch! Ouch! Ha ha ha! There. You see? The slightest touch or vibration Produces from the patients An unrestrained cry of pain. Pain? Torture, like hot iron. The toe is still warm. Go ahead. Feel it. Ouch! Ohh... Ha ha ha! Here we have a patient without humor, But nevertheless afflicted with the well-Known, Clinically established poor man's gout, To be found among those Who have the opportunity Of lapping up the leftovers of their betters. I do not lap. A little ale for what ails you sometimes, but why not? This is obviously the self-Indulgent type... Meats, spices, gravies. The more attractive they are to the palate, The more they conduce to gluttonous feeding, And the more they inflict This penalty upon the victim. What, no meat? No roast beef? What about Yorkshire pudding? No beer? No! Dress the toe with great tenderness, nurse. Yes, doctor. I will. Yes. I'm sure Mr. Athelny will appreciate that. I will, indeed. Yes. I think we can have you home before the end of the week, Mr. Athelny. Oh, I hope so, doctor. We shall miss you. Oh, really? You flatter me, doctor. Not at all. Oh, thank you. Thank you very... Thank... No meat. No beer. No port. Oh. Hello, Mr. Athelny. How are you, my nice young friend? I didn't know you knew Spanish. Oh? I lived in Spain for almost 11 years. What were you doing there? I was secretary to the British water company in Toledo. You know all about san Juan de la Cruz, don't you? I don't, indeed. No? You should, my boy. He was one of the great Spanish mystics, One of the finest poets they ever had. You should learn Spanish. It's a noble tongue, my dear... What is your name? Carey. Philip Carey. Ah, dr. Carey. Not doctor yet. Just a student. Oh, I dislike students. Ouch! Did you see those young jackanapes just now with that pompous doctor? If I were a side of fat pork hanging in the butcher's shop, They couldn't have inspected me more closely. Did you have to come to a general ward of a hospital? Well, why not? I am the recipient of charity. My principle is to profit by every benefit that society provides. When I'm ill, I get myself patched up in a hospital. I've no false shame. No. I send my children to the board school to be educated free. Do you really? Yes, and a capital education they get, too, Much better than I got at college. My dear fellow, how else could I educate them? I've got 9, you know. 9. Look here, you must come and see them all When I get back home, would you? I should like to very much. Good. Dr. Tyrell said I'd be out of here before the end of the week. Come for dinner on Sunday. I'd like to. One of the rules of this house is that Sunday dinner should never alter. It's a ritual. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding for 50 Sundays in the year. On Easter Sunday, lamb and green peas. And at michaelmas, roast goose and applesauce. Thus we preserve the traditions of our people. Take your thumb out of the jug. My first child... Maria del sol. I christened her and dedicated her To the glorious sun of castile. She sounds lustrous. She is lustrous. Come here, lustrous. Now, shake hands with Mr. Carey. Hello, Maria del sol. Her mother calls her Sally. And Thorpe, her brother, calls her pudding face. Isn't she enormous? How old are you, Sally? 17, father, come next June. I hope you didn't lay the table here on my account. I should be quite happy to eat with the children. Oh, I... Sally! Oh, excuse me, father. Sit down. Ahh! No beer. Ha ha ha! Ahh! I always have meals for myself. Yeah. I like antique ways. Women oughtn't to sit down at table with men. No. Ah! Roast beef. Where's the Yorkshire pudding? Coming, father. Women ruin conversations. It's bad for them. Puts ideas in their heads. Women are never at ease when they have ideas. Where is the Yorkshire pudding? Coming, father. Ohh... ohh... What a cook. I was married to a lady once. Never marry a lady, my boy. No. Ah! Careful, father. It's hot. Well, as it should be. Ooh! Ah! Did you ever see such a handsome, strapping girl as Sally? She's never had a day's illness in her life, hmm? No. What a mother she'll make. If you don't stop talking, father, Your dinner will get cold. Ah, yes. Oh, well, uh, do you mind grace? Who? Grace. Oh, no. On the contrary. For what we are about to receive, May the lord make us truly thankful. Amen. Well, yeah. We must thank the lord For simple pleasures: Roast beef... No beef. No beef? Oh. Ha ha ha! No beef. No Yorkshire pudding. No beer, eh? No beef. Soon I got into the habit of going To the Athlnlys' every Sunday. 8:00? I've been here 8 hours. How the time flies. Well, I must go. There's no hurry. Where are the children? They're in bed. Sally and her mother have gone to church. I like women to go to church. I like women to be religious. I think they ought to be, don't you? Yes. Yes, but Sally never pays any attention to me. No. She just goes about her business Indifferent to wars, revolutions, and cataclysms. What a wife she'll make to an honest man. Oh, you are silly, mother. No, I'm not. Well, here they are. Oh, it's cold out! It's warm in here. Is that you, mother? Is that child not in bed yet? Sally! How red your nose is, and we've got company. But it's frozen, father. Well, thaw it out, dear. Going, Philip? Yes. I must. Did you pray for me, darling? Of course we did. I can't get Athlnly to go to church. He's no better than an atheist. Uncle Philip! Now, come on back to bed. Are you going, uncle Philip? Yes. I must. Well, say good night, then. Good night, uncle Philip. Good night, Jeanie. Good night. Good night, Thorpe. Now, that's enough. Go on to bed. Coming next Sunday? Yes, I will. You know, Sally never kisses gentlemen Till she's seen them at least a dozen times. Then you must keep on asking me. You mustn't take any notice of what father says. You certainly are a favorite With our children, Philip. They took to you right away. And they took to the plum cake you brought. Mr. Carey's uncle Philip to them now, isn't he, father? Is he uncle Philip to you, my girl? Is he? I don't know, father. If it wasn't for my toe, I'd walk to the bus with you. No. I thought I'd walk down oxford street to Mont blanche. You'll come again next Sunday, won't you, Philip? It's a real charity to talk to you. Of course he will. Sally will walk with him to the corner If he needs any more persuading. You know, she's the most self-Possessed young woman. I shudder to think what'll happen when she puts her hair up. Well, good night. Good night, Carey. Dunsford. This is a surprise. Come in. Hello, Carey. I had no idea you lived so far away. This is very cheap. You seemed very depressed And preoccupied this morning. I had a feeling you might be ill or in trouble of some kind. Are you really short of funds? Because if you are, I can help a little. You're really very kind. Well, something's wrong. I saw Mildred Rogers again last night. That waitress? She's not a waitress anymore. I saw her on Piccadilly circus, wearing a large hat With a mass of flowers on it. Her cheeks were thick with rouge. Her eyebrows were blackened. She looked thin and ill. Yes. Did you have to speak to her? At first, I couldn't believe it. I followed her, and then I understood. It was horrible. I felt the only reason could be an urgent need for money... But when she saw me and I spoke to her, She denied it. She told me to go away. I couldn't. Then she wept, There in the street with her hat and feathers, The rouge, weeping. She seemed so utterly lost and helpless. I took her to a room she knew of Back of the British museum. Wasn't that foolish? No. She lives out at highbury. She has a baby with her. She's been coming to the west end every evening. Couldn't she have gone back to work again as a waitress? She said she'd tried but she'd been ill. Now you can't get her off your mind. I was halfway home when I turned back To tell her to come here with her baby. To come here? Yes. But you're hard up. I pay a women 3 and sixpence a week To clean the place and do a little cooking for me, And I've got a spare room here. I told Mildred she could come and take the woman's place. Her food wouldn't come to much more Than the money I would save. I bought a chair, a chest of drawers, And this piece of rug this morning. Is she here now? No, but she's coming this afternoon. I think I'll go. Carey, you mustn't let anything interfere with this next course. Old Tyrell says it's the turning point, And I'd hate to see you fall behind the way you did before. Thanks, Dunsford. Cabby? Yes, sir. 52 Withman place. Here you are. Is this your luggage? Yes, it is. Mr. Carey expecting you? Yes, he is. Oh, all right. What's your name? Mrs. Philip Carey. Philip! Let me help you. She's getting to be so heavy. George, will you take Mrs. Carey's box up? She's got some things out here. Mrs. Carey? I told her we was married. I had to. Why did you tell her we were married? Well, I had to tell her something. I didn't know what she'd think of me, arriving here bag and baggage. I had to tell her on account of the baby. Shouldn't I have said it? It doesn't matter. I'll put her to bed right away. Where shall I go? Come on. In here. Right here. I'm afraid I haven't got a cradle for the baby. Oh, she'll be all right. She's tired out. She's always tired, like her mother. Look at you. Remember you said once down at Brighton You'd bring her up as your own? Well, now you've got your chance. If I'm going to cook and clean up, I'd better buy an apron or something. Sit down, Philip. No need to be so formal. Mildred, I would have found a room For you somewhere by yourself, But actually I'm very hard up. I've got only 80 pounds To carry me through at the hospital until I qualify, And that's for everything. I get a bit panic-Stricken sometimes When I think of the future. What about that old uncle of yours? Well, if anything should happen to him, Of course there would be his insurance, which would come to me. You know, Philip... It's very good of you not to say anything disagreeable to me After what you found out about me last night. Don't think of it. It's past, isn't it? You are a gentleman in every sense of the word, The only one I ever met, and you haven't changed a bit. I bought some extra milk for the baby. And you're going out now, just as I've arrived? Give me my hat. I don't know that I will now. On Monday nights, I meet some of my fellow students. We spend the evening together drinking and talking. Philip, you are an old silly. A fat lot you must have ever loved me. It's a little bit humiliating. What's humiliating? What you said last night in that room When you said I could come and stay here. Did you mean you didn't want me to be anything to you Except just a cook and that sort of thing? Yes, I did. Don't sit up for me. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. Good evening, sir. I've got Mrs. Carey's box here. Bring it in here. In here? No. In there. Well, you better put it down there. You might wake the baby. There you are, missus. Come on, ma. Oh, shut up, you! Good king Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen when the snow lay round about... Here you are. Here's a nice little sprig Of mistletoe for luck, ma'am. I saw Mrs. Foreman out. They've got a 12-Pound turkey. I just got a chicken for us. Mrs. Foreman remarked about my husband Not being out for the Christmas shopping. I told her you had a cold. Oh, it ain't half blowy out. I'm froze. I bought myself a little present. I haven't a rag to wear on my back Around the house of an evening. I took the money out of your cash box. I hope you don't mind. You did? I needed money for the shopping, anyway. It was only a pound I took for everything. Where did you find the key? Under the paper in the drawer, where you keep it. That's all I have in the world. After the new year, I think you should try to find a job. What have I got to wear to find a job in? You bought something today. This isn't the one to find a job in. Wait till you see it. You could put the holly around the place, And it wouldn't look so much like an undertaker's. You'll find a bunch of mistletoe there. You could hang that up, too. Couldn't we go out somewhere tomorrow night? Do you have to go to your friend Mr. Athelny and all those brats? No, I'll see the Athlnlys tonight. Tonight? It's Christmas eve. I'm taking them a Christmas tree. I bought one for you and the baby, too. What did you do with the bunch of mistletoe? Oh. Here it is. Kiss me under the mistle... I don't like mistletoe. You know, you haven't kissed me since I came here. Oh, Mildred, don't talk rot. You're making a fool out of yourself And making me feel like an idiot. I want to make up for all the wrong I did you, Philip. I can't go on like this. It's not in human nature. It's too late. Too late? When I look at you now, I think of Miller and Griffiths and... And a lot of other things. You rescued me, and I'm grateful to you. I've told you I was grateful to you. You may stay here because you have Nowhere else to go and because of the baby... But as friends only. No! Don't be such an old silly, Philip. You disgust me. Who hung around after me from the start When I told you to keep away? You did, you slimy, sneaking swine. Who hung around after me? Who? You did. I knew what you was up to. I knew what was in your dirty mind. Well, you mug. I never cared For you, not once. Not once, you mug. I made a blinking fool of you all, I did. Yes. And me and Harry Griffiths used to laugh. We used to laugh and laugh at you behind your back. We laughed at you. I let you kiss me for the money. For the money, yes, and it made me sick. I had to wipe my mouth. Go on, you creepy... Run away, run away if you can... Or limp! It makes me sick to my stomach to think I ever Let myself be mauled about by a cripple! Yes, that's what you are. A dirty cripple. Cripple! Cripple! Hey, she chucked it out. Is she going to chuck any more out? She throwed it out of the window. Uncle Philip, uncle Philip! Daddy, it's uncle Philip. Hello, Thorpe. Why aren't you in bed? Santa Claus is on his way, you know. A Christmas tree. A small one, but a nice one. Philip, my dear fellow. A merry, merry Christmas. Betty, it's Philip. Where have you been hiding yourself? We thought we'd lost you forever. Come in, come in. Philip, this is a nice surprise. We've missed you. Uncle Philip brought a Christmas tree. Oh. Now off to bed, Thorpe. It's a little broken, I'm afraid. It had an accident. But it's very kind of you. Very kind. Thank you. Now come on, young man, off to bed, Or there will be no Santa Claus for you. I'll take this for you, dear. By Jove, this is kind of you, Philip. My word, it's a very nice little tree, isn't it, betty? Don't you think so, eh? Lovely. Yes. Now put it down. No. No. No, dear. Put it down. Why? Come on, put your coat on. They'll be here any minute now. No. The young man must be shown at once that this Is no ordinary family that he's preparing to enter. What's the matter, Philip? Oh, he looks chilled. Oh, uh, what young man? You must wait and meet him. You may even pass judgment. Oh? Our Sally has a young man, And she's bringing him home tonight. Yes, and I, the traditional grim parent, Have to ask him his intentions. Oh, really? Yes. The young man popped the question to Sally. She told us about it, and we said, "oh, bring him in." He's in a very good way of business. Isn't Sally rather young? She's young, healthy, and feminine. And since she's been apprenticed To the dressmaker, she's had many admirers. Sally's old for her years. But she's helped me with the housework And the children, and she's a mighty good manager, too. So, sometimes I tell her I think She's a bit too fond of having her own way. I'm finding myself A little jealous. Oh, you never noticed our little girl. Larger, she is. Although in confidence, I can't say the same For her where you were concerned. Now I find myself flattered. You shouldn't have stayed away so long. Is he with you? No, mother, he's not. Soon I will be a grandfather, And that will be yet a new experience. I rather relish the thought. Philip! We've been wondering what happened to you. Sally, where is he? He jilted you. You look tired. Merry Christmas, and congratulations. There's nothing to congratulate me for, Philip. No? Sally, where is this Mr. Donaldson of yours? I told him I wasn't very anxious To marry anyone just now. And what did the poor young man say to that? Well, he took on so, I sent him away. But, Sally, I thought you said he was nice. He was silly, mother. You're not going to have him in? No. Well. When you've got a good chance like that, It seems wicked not to take it. It's no good your carrying on, mother. She's not going to marry him. If you want me to earn my own living, mother, I can always be a servant somewhere. What? That I would never permit. You are an Athlnly. The Athlnlys are masters... Masters without a bob in the world, perhaps, But serfs, never! Athelny, you're waking the children. Sally? I brought you a small present. It belonged to my mother. Go on, take it. Look, father. Well, that is nice. Give him a kiss for it, Under the mistletoe. No, I... You ungrateful little hussy. Why not? It was very kind of you, Philip. Well, I must go. But it's Christmas eve. I know, but... Philip, are you leading a double life? You disappear for weeks at a time. You belong to us, you know. You did for a while. I love you all very, very much. You know that. Well, then dinner tomorrow. 1:00 sharp. Turkey, stuffing, sausages, pudding. We shall expect you. You will come, won't you? I'll try. Good night. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, Philip. No coat. He's got something on his mind. I wonder why he wouldn't be definite About coming for Christmas dinner tomorrow. Oh, well, he said he'd try. Of course, it could be that he had A wife and children hidden away in a dark cellar. If he has, why should he hide them? It's no wonder he doesn't want To come here, father... Why he wouldn't stay to supper, Why he hasn't been here, Why he won't come tomorrow. It's because you keep throwing me up in his face. I think I understand, my little girl. Do I, Sally? It's Philip, isn't it? Hmm? Come on. Tell your father. Why, Philip's never even noticed her except as a child. You have an imagination, Athlnly. Look here. Tomorrow we'll go over, you and I. Top of the bus. We'll go over to Kensington And drag him out by the scruff of the neck. We may have to carry him. He's quite tall, you know. Let's do it. You take his head. I'll take his legs. We may have quite a job getting him on top of the bus. Well, he gave you that, didn't he? Yes. It's pretty, isn't it? Why, it's Mr. Carey. Oh, come in, sir. Hello, Mrs. Gray. A nice night for Christmas eve, ain't it? That's right. Yes. Oh, you're soaking, and no overcoat. No. Is Mr. Dunsford in? Hmm? Mr. Dunsford. Is he in? No. He's not home. He's gone back to Yorkshire For the Christmas holidays. He said he'd be back, though, Before the new year was out. Mr. Griffiths, he's upstairs. Doing a bit of celebrating, as usual. But then Christmas comes but once a year, as they say. Why don't you hop up and see him? No. I don't want to see Mr. Griffiths. Will you sit down, Mr. Carey? Thank you. You could go into your old rooms. The gentleman using them is away, too. I'm not keeping you from anything, am I? It's Christmas, I know. Not at all. I can light a bit of fire In there for you. Oh. You're soaking. I've got a drop of brandy in the house... That's if you could take spirits. Yes, if it isn't too much trouble. Thank you. Where might you be living now, Mr. Carey? You ain't well, Mr. Carey, and you know it. Oh, I'm so sorry. Ok. Mrs. Gray, would you mind getting my medicine kit? You'll find it next to my desk. Yes, sir. You might ask my friends to be a little quieter, please. Stay where you are, old boy. What's going on? We must get these wet clothes off. No. Do as I say, you fool. I'm a doctor. I think you have pneumonia. The first fine day in spring, I felt strong enough to go out, And I immediately went to see my old friends, the Athlnlys. Hello, Sally. May I come in? Of course, Philip. The house seems quiet. Where are the children? They've gone to a picnic in Epping forest. You're wearing an overcoat Now that the sun is out. Sally! Yes, Philip? Your hair is up. It's nice of you to have noticed it, Philip. Do you want to see father? It's Philip, father. Hello, Athlnly. Hello, Carey. Sally's growing up. Yes, the buds are blooming. Time goes on. I'm very glad to be here again. I thought a great deal about you all. Oh, that's nice. I've been ill, very ill. I'm sorry. Sit down. Thanks. You look thinner. You still working at the hospital? No. Oh. You've chucked medicine? I lost the little money I had. I can't afford to go on with it. No money. What about your uncle, the vicar? He's very ill. I wrote to him, and dr. Stone, Who is taking care of him, Said he couldn't last through the winter. In the meantime, I must find a job. I have this deformity, of course. Oh, your club foot. You don't think with your feet, do you? I had so many hours to think Since I saw you last. Christmas, wasn't it? Christmas. Yes. You know, I can tell you the history of man in one line. Oh, can you? He's born, he suffers, and he dies. To me it doesn't matter Whether I was born or not born, Whether I live or cease to live. I've given up my ideas of happiness. It matters as little as pain. It's all part of a design, One of a set of patterns. The most obvious pattern, and the most beautiful one to me, Is that man is born. He grows into manhood. I mean, manhood. He marries, produces children, toils for his bread, And then he dies. Well, I feel that in giving up The desire for happiness, I'm throwing away the last of my illusions. Illusions? Your deformity, as you call it, Is an illusion. Everyone suffers from some defect of body or mind. You can say the whole world Is like a sick house with no rhyme nor reason for it... Sick hearts, sick lungs, languor of the will. Haven't you a holy compassion for them all? Can they help themselves? My dear Carey, the only reasonable Thing you can do is to accept the good in men And be patient with their faults. Remember, the dying god once said, "forgive them; They know not what they do." There's a certain solace and comfort In the feeling that things don't matter. Things don't matter. Do your wife and child matter nothing to you? You have a wife and child, haven't you? Oh, my dear Carey, I had no thought Of discussing your private matters. The thing that concerned me for the moment Was your mood, your outlook. My two eminent doctors are expecting me home. It's my first time out alone, you know. Well, that's fine. If you really want work, I could take you Down to Leonard and Smedley's, where I am, And introduce you to the head buyer. That would be very kind. Good-Bye. So long. Hello, Carey. Have you ever felt that opening and shutting effect in the head? I need a drink. Hey, Carey, what were you doing in my medicine kit? I didn't want to disturb you. What are you trying to do, kill yourself? Yes. I believe you mean it. Why? The horror of myself. Carey, wait a minute. What? I think as a doctor, I can understand you. Well? You've had a bad illness. You've lost your money. You've lost your possessions. You've had a violent shock. You're sensitive and proud. You wanted to be a painter, and you failed. You wanted to be a doctor, But because of the lack of money, You had to give that up for the time being. It's a frustration. Is that wretched woman still in your mind? Did you find her wretched When you took her away? When she fell in love with you, did you? I'm asking you. Is she? I suppose she always will be. It's because of the suffering she caused me That I'll never be quite free of her. That is the horror of myself that I mean. I'm glad you told me that, Carey, very glad. Now I think we can help you. What's happened? What's the matter? Our friend Carey was contemplating killing himself. Now I think we can tell him about Mildred Rogers. Where is Mildred Rogers? I'll take you to see her now. I hadn't intended... How did you find her? She wrote to you while you were ill. Griffiths and I... Yes. I want to see her. All right. Get your hat and coat. Number two. Where is the child? That was a month ago we lost her. Round of that? Yes. And this one, I'm afraid, Is only a question of hours. Yes, I know. We did all we could, Carey. You were very kind. Dr. Griffiths? The doctor says, "will you wait?" He'll be down in a moment. Yes. You go on, Carey. I'll see you later. So he jumped on the donkey, but the donkey ran away! Yes, and they never found him. Go on, off you go. You run, too. What a neighborhood. Just waiting for my kids to get home. Athelny, uh, was it because you thought I was married That your manner towards me has changed? It was unlike you. You seemed uncordial. You... I didn't want to hurt your feelings, Carey, But we have our little family problems like anyone else. Nothing serious, I hope. Come in. Come in. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Yes. Real spring. Well, our little Sally found a prince charming. It was all right, as far as it went. And she's told us he hadn't any idea of it at all. And she... She's just at that age. I'm sure it was her first, well, call it romantic emotion. You know? Hmm. Yeah. Well, last Christmas morning, Sally and I Went over to where you lived to invite you for Christmas dinner, And we heard about your wife and baby. I'll come to the point, Carey. Betty and I were relieved when you didn't come here... Wait a minute. You mean me? Yes. You are the prince charming. We were sorry to hear of your illness, naturally, And the little girl's all right. I like you, Carey. I like you very much. You asked me a question, and I've told you. And it's nothing for you to think about... Nothing. Oh, and another thing. I don't want Sally to know what I've told you. No, of course not. No. Today, for instance, she felt your troubles keenly... Did she? Yes. But her mother's taking her for a walk in the park. It's all very human, Carey. She'll be all right. Athelny, I was never married. No? The child was not mine. The woman you know of is dying, And her child preceded her months ago. I'm sorry to hear that, Carey. No, it's just something I could never explain. Don't. I've suddenly found that my life Is in my own hands to do what I like with. I'm free for the first time in so long. Don't tell me anymore, Carey. She did stay in my rooms Because she had nowhere to go. She needed help. You were in love with her. I'll never know. They're coming in now. You're going to stay and have a cup of tea. Do me a favor, will you? What? Will you tell Sally I was never married? If you really want me to, Carey, Yes, I will. Father says, "will you stay to tea, Philip?" Yes, please, Sally. Sally, come here. Yes, Philip? You are like milk and honey. Yes, Philip. One day, will you marry me? There is no one else I would marry. Please don't think me a crybaby, Philip. I'll come back. THEYCAME2001
