Well, it's the wrong damn one. And now they're pitching a bitch over there. I ordered what you told me to. I don't order the wrong parts, son.

That's just bad luck on both our parts. Ain't it? Say, chief, you don't know where I might could hire me a driver for a week or two, do you? No. No. Might do it myself just to drive this girl, but I gotta keep my hand on the plow here. Pay's good. No, no, no. Don't you tempt me. Sir. That driving job, how much does it pay? Well, I see you can grease them. How do I know you can drive them? I can drive them. $10 a day plus meals and room. When does it start? Looks like you already got a job, son. When does it start? Can you handle a car in the snow? Hell, I bet you ain't even never seen snow. All right, look, be at this address Monday at 8:00. And clean your ass up. Boss, we're using the name Wells on this trip. This is Mr. Wells. Nice to meet you, sir. Okay, then. Need to make it to Knoxville tonight, about seven, eight hours. Might be some bad weather coming in.

OI' Snake Belly told you I wasn't supposed to drink any whiskey now, didn't he? He said I don't get paid if you show up drunk. Boy, who do you think is paying you? Fire that weasel-eyed thief anyway. Yes, operator, I'm still here. The call has been refused. What do you mean, refused? The party will not accept the charges. He does not know a Mr. Combs. Oh.

My instructions were to call you. Where's Stan? I don't think I know Stan. He's a tall guy. Mr. Wells calls him Snake Belly. Oh, yes. That's who gave me the job. Why aren't you calling him? Well, this is the number he gave me. I thought you were Mr. Wells' business manager. No, I'm not his business manager. Where are you? Chattanooga. Chattanooga? Is that all? Yeah, we got a late start. And then the weather turned bad on us. Is he drinking? No. No, sir. Yeah, right. You may have noticed Mr. Wells will take a drink of whiskey. Yes, sir, I have noticed that. Look, it is very important that you get him to Charleston tomorrow and that you get him there sober. Are you listening to me? Now, there are a lot of people, mainly him, who are counting on you. This is your one and only job. I'll do my best, sir. All right. Call me in the morning. I wanna know when you leave. Okay- I'm expecting somebody. A doctor. Need me a shot of B12. Work like a charm. What're you drinking, Sorbonne? Nothing, thanks. I asked you what you were drinking. Beer, I guess. Is that that country singer? Yeah, I think it is. I do love a road trip. Hey, how old are you? Nineteen. Oh. Good. I'd hate to think I was contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Thank you. Hey, chief. Can you get those two pretty girls over there a round of drinks on us, please? So you like beer, boy? I can take it or leave it. Not me, Sorbonne. Not me. Is that your doctor? Yeah. Guess I better go get that shot of B12. Go ahead, sir. Mr. O'Keefe, this is Silas Combs. Tell me you're on the road and not still at the hotel. He won't wake up. He just keeps rolling back to sleep. Oh, hell. Did he get drunk last night? Yes, he did. The doctor came about 11:30. What doctor? Why, I guess they're friends. He gave him a vitamin shot or something. Son, you gotta get moving. What do I do? He looks real bad. You want me to call that doctor back? No. Can you dress him? Okay- Now, listen to me. Everything, and I mean everything, is riding on you getting there tonight. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. Here we go again. I'm getting too old for this. When leaves begin to die That means He's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry The silence of A falling star Lights up a purple Sky And as I wonder Where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry Turn the radio on. What's the matter, you don't like music? Never much cared for it. What the hell time is it, anyway? About 11:30. What we got, like 300 more miles to go? More like 400. Well, you gonna have to do better than that, boy. I gotta be there in seven hours. The roads are real bad, sir. I'm going over the speed limit as it is. I can't go any faster. Boy, this Eldorado is the best damn car that ever rolled out of Detroit. There ain't no road she don't eat for lunch. Well, I can make it up when we get on the highway. Punch it, boy. How the hell did I get in this car? I put you here. Did I dress myself? No, sir, I did it for you. You didn't go poking around in my suitcase now, did you? I put your gun in there after I unloaded it. You do anything else? No, sir. You sure about that? Yes, sir, I'm very sure. 'Cause I know exactly how much traveling money I brought with me, boy. I didn't see no money 'cause I wasn't looking for no money, sir. I changed you into a fresh shirt and left you in your pants and your drawers from last night, it's all the same to you, sir. You can stop calling me "sir." I'll stop calling you "sir" when you stop calling me "boy." Well, now, that's fair. I call you Sorbonne. I like that. How old do you think I am, Sorbonne? I ain't much at guessing games. Go on, guess. I don't know. Twenty-nine. Oh, that surprise you? Yes, sir, it does. It's all that clean living I done. It ain't natural. My God, what a headache. Because the king of beers is leading all the rest When you say Budweiser, you've said it all Is this your business, son? Driving people around the country? No, sir. This is the first time. Fact, this is the first time I've been out of Alabama. What is your business then? I work at the garage. Ray's? Yes, sir. You like it? Not really. No, Ray screams a whole lot. Thinks I'm worthless. Well, there's no surprise there. Ray's an asshole. What would you rather be doing? I don't know. You don't think about what you'd rather be doing? Why not? Well, I ain't gonna get to, anyway. I don't see the point. Boy, you're gonna have to pull over. I gotta take a leak. Do you mind if I ask what business you're in? Yes, I damn hell do mind. What the hell business you think I'm in? I reckon you're in the music business. You really don't know who I am, son? Sir? Wells isn't my real name. It's just a traveling name. Why don't you like music? Everybody likes music. I just don't. There's no reason. You don't ever listen to the radio? I don't got a radio. You want one? I guess. No radio, huh? Nope. How about a girl? You got yourself a girl, Sorbonne? No, sir. You think there might be a connection there? Sir? I asked you not to call me "sir" anymore. You do like girls, right? Yes, sir. I mean, yeah. Hugging and kissing, that sort of thing, that appeal to you? Yeah. I'm gonna tell you a little secret. They love to dance. Oh, they love it when you make them swing a little bit. Make them cry a little bit. You don't think I'm riding in the back of that Cadillac there on account of my good looks now, do you? What is your real name, then? It's Luke. Just Luke, ol' buddy. Oh, hell. Well, you gonna have to make a move. I can't. I can't pass this many cars. What the hell is an old truck like that doing out here in the first place? You got to do it, Sorbonne. Mr. Wells, I can't pass this many people. We can take them on the right. Mr. Wells... Just do it! He's exiting up here. I can see the turnoff. Sorbonne, I got some news for you. You're gonna stay on your side of town unless you learn how to start making decisions. Or let me put it in another way. If I'm not in Charleston, West Virginia by 7:00, not only are you not getting paid, boy, your ass is walkin' back to Alabama. Oh, man. Oh, my God! Sorbonne! Oh, my God! Get your ass turned around, get over to the side of the road. Right now. Sir, are you all right? I been better, son. I been better. Let me see your license. You haven't been drinking, have you? No, sir, I have not. You just keep moving. Just move it. Where you boys headed? Charleston, West Virginia. Would you care to tell me what the hell that was all about back there? We're in a real hurry, sir. He's gotta be there by tonight. I'm awfully sorry for driving the way I was. Officer, I'll be more than happy to pay the fine. Hell, I'll even pay double the good state of Tennessee. They been awful kind to me. Put your wallet back in your pocket, sir. Now, I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna drive straight 4 and 3/10 miles to the town of Loudon. You're gonna turn right on Maple Street. There's the courthouse. You can tell your story to the justice of the peace. Well, we sure will. And I thank you, Officer. I hope you have a nice day. I'll be right behind you. Well, that went pretty well. What in the world's in Charleston? Mr. Wells is in the music business, and he's expected there tonight, Your Honor. Is he a performer? Well, he has a guitar. I reckon he is. You don't know? I just started yesterday. I don't really work for him, though. I work for Ray's Tire and Auto. But I only took the job 'cause a man needed a driver. Then he quit, so I had to... Son, have a seat. This is gonna take longer than I thought. Yes, sir. Where's the passenger? He was settling up with the driver whose car got bent, and now he's vomiting in the men's room. Did you question him? Not yet. Trooper Hamilton here detected the strong odor of alcohol in your vehicle. Is the passenger the only person been drinking? Yes, sir. Well, that helps you a little, son, but you're still in trouble. What in the hell were you thinking? I can't say no to him. You know, he's got a real temper. He made you? Yes, sir. How'd he do that? Did he have a gun? Did he threaten you? He said I'd have to walk home if I didn't. But you were in control of the vehicle. And your license says you're a legal adult. Now that makes you the responsible party. You should've said no, son. That would have been a whole lot better decision. Am I going to jail? I apologize for the delay, Your Honor. Are you all right? Touch of the flu. Well, we're almost done here. So you're pleading guilty to the trooper's charge? $100 or 10 days in jail. What about the car? Are you the owner? Yes, I am. Show me the proof, and I reckon you're free to go. Mr. Wells, sir, I ain't got any money. I was just doing like you asked. Just pay the damn fine, Sorbonne. You gotta get me to Charleston. He's just doing his job, like you boys. It's my fault. Well, how 'bout you boys slowin' down and enjoyin' the ride? Lot of drunks out there on New Year's. We'll do that. You all have a happy New Year now, all right? You all take it easy next time. Had you goin' for a minute back there, didn't I? You don't look so good. I just need to take a nap, is all. We better get gem'. We got some "me to make up. Yes, sir. Turn on the radio. Bristol. Virginia on one side of the street, Tennessee on the other. This here's the cradle, Sorbonne. Sir? Country music. Jimmie Rodgers and the Carters, they brought it down from the mountains, turned it into pure gold. Is it really 1:00? Yes, sir. I mean, yeah. We ain't gonna make it, are we? Not by 7:00. Maybe 10:00 or 11:00 if the road stays clear, but it's clouding up again. It might snow. Damn. A lot of people counting on ol' Luke, boy. A lot of people. Take the next left up here. Flight 892 is now boarding. AH passengers please proceed to the gate. Flight 892 is now boarding. All passengers please proceed to the gate. No more flights to Charleston till tomorrow. Closest I can get is Wheeling, and that flight doesn't leave till 8:00. Let's find us a charter. Yes, sir. Just give us five minutes, we'll get her all fueled up and ready to go. Sorry about the rush. Hell of a way to spend your New Year's. Well, you're paying for the privilege, hoss. You ain't never been on a plane before, have you, Sorbonne? Well, it beats grease-monkeying for that asshole Ray, though, don't it? Where are we? Right on top of Charleston. It's all socked in with snow and fog. Can't land anywhere for 100 miles. Okay, so? Sorry, hoss. We're gonna have to turn around and head back or we're not gonna have enough fuel to get back to Bristol. Just get me into Bristol. Roger. Well, it was fun while it lasted, Sorbonne. Now there's only one way you're gonna find peace. There's only one way you're gonna find happiness. There's only one way you're gonna find joy. Now, let me tell you... Here comes the hook. He's gonna ask for money right now. Folks, this Bible-thumper can only tell it like it is and spread the good word. Now, I ain't much asking for help. But the good Lord gave me the word, and I can't do his work all by myself. And that's where you come in. Now, you may be asking, "Preacher, Turn that polecat off. "How much does God want me to give?" Well, how much you think... He said the world was gonna end in '49, too. Said it in Tuscaloosa right after 'Bama lost to Tennessee. Folks there thought it already had. Can you turn that heat up any more? Yes, sir. Sorbonne. Sir? If you call me sir one more time, I'm gonna go get my pistol. You all right? I just need to eat something. We gonna have to make us a phone call. Will you do it for me, Sorbonne? Yeah. I will. "Signs following." How's that? Well, that church back there, the message board said "Signs following." What does that mean? Oh. It means they dance and shake with the Holy Spirit. Oh. And they handle rattlesnakes, too. It's a hell of a show. Smell meat. Sure hope it ain't squirrel. Might be possum. Well, I wish I was in London or some seaport town I'd put my foot on a steamboat and I'd sail the ocean 'round While sailing 'round the ocean while sailing 'round the sea I'd think of handsome Molly wherever she may be Help ya? How 'bout some grub for the weary travelers? Got some soup going. How's that suit you? That suits us just fine. How y'all doin' today? What do you call these parts 'round here? Muhlenberg County. It's God's country, ain't it? Y'all mind if I warm my hide by that stove there? Come on in. Here you go. Thank you. You play that thing pretty good now, don't you? I find my way around it. Well, let's hear it, if you don't mind. I don't mind. You want a blast? Help take that chill away. Why hell, I was wonderin' when you was gonna ask me. Colder than a polar bear's tit out there and you damn Virginians make a Alabama boy beg for some sunshine. You like hillbilly music? Yeah, I like hillbilly music. Yeah, I'll accept the charges. Where are you, son? Virginia, about an hour north of Bristol. We ran into a little trouble outside of Knoxville. What kind of trouble, Silas? Police trouble. We ain't gonna make it to Charleston by 7:00. Yeah, I kind of put that together, son. Thank you very much. I'm really looking forward to this next call I'm gonna have to make. Damn it, boy! I thought we'd left all this stuff behind. Four thousand people waiting to see him on New Year's Eve. I think you got a bigger problem than that, sir. What do you mean? I mean, he's powerful sick. Oh, hell, he's just hungover. No, sir, I know hungover. I've seen that my whole life. This is much worse. I think he better go to a hospital or come home. It's that bad? Yes, sir, it is. This business is killing him. And quittin' it would kill him quicker. What do you want me to do? Well, there's no point in going to Charleston. They'd probably just lynch you two anyway. Tell you what. Get him to Ohio for the matinee tomorrow, and I'll meet you there. Yes, sir. Thanks. He had a wife and six kids, and he ain't never comin' out of that hole. Not even 30-years-old. That's a damn shame. That ain't the worst part. What do you reckon the company give his family? $100. A man's life's only worth $100. Trouble, leave me alone Trouble, leave me alone You were in that bar in Arkansas Every bottle in East Tennessee You left a trace in the lines of my face in the gutters of Bourbon Street Trouble, leave me alone Why must you torture me? I wish you'd find another home I wish you'd just let me be Trouble, leave me alone Oh! I need something, Sorbonne. It's bad. Okay. Let me get you to a doctor. No. There's a town just up ahead. I just need me some Pepto-Bismol, is all. Here you go. I gotta get you to a hospital. What's the damn point? Mr. Wells... It's Luke. My name's Luke. Nothin'. How far is it to Canton, Ohio? About 300 miles. You know, there was a time when I didn't dream about nothin' but this. So be careful what you wish for, Sorbonne. It might just fall on you. What do you dream about? Nothin', sir. Do me a favor. Stop being respectful and kissin' my ass. Don't treat me like a boss man and don't keep quiet just 'cause I'm the man in the backseat. And make me feel like there's somebody real up there and not just the back of some hired man's head. Can I ask you a question first? You were gonna leave me back there in Tennessee, weren't you? Well, ol' Luke has a history in this part of the world. Figured I might have to get while the gettin' was good and find somebody else to bail your ass out. What are you writin'? Oh. None of your damn business, that's what. We was talkin' about you. You go to high school? I quit in the 10th grade. How come? Just didn't take. Didn't take. So you fix cars. Yeah. But you ain't any damn good at it. Well, I just don't care for it, is all. But what do you care for? Not music. We know that. Not really. Sports? Baseball, football? Cock fighting? How 'bout girls? We already talked about women, right? Yeah, we did. You ever have one? No. You're probably better off for it. All they do is tear your heart out and then leave you standing there like a damn fool. What's your daddy do? Time. Oh. That's why that old boy back there scared the shit out of you. You scared of that, ain't you? Followin' in Daddy's footsteps. How 'bout your mama, then? What's she do? I don't wanna talk about this. My mama ran a whorehouse. Beat that. Don't wanna talk about my family, Mr. Wells. Luke. Whatever your name is. My daddy took me down to Gulf Shores when I was a boy. Told me about footprints in the sands of time. I didn't understand it then. I think I might now. It don't matter, Sorbonne. Not a damn bit of it matters for nothin'. There's gotta be some freedom from these worries on my mind There's gotta be some rest for me somewhere down the line Gonna end this lonesome journey I started long ago Find a place to stop on... Your friend don't look too good. Yeah, I know. What do you call these parts? Freedom County, near Mount Hope. Your differential's leaking. It's probably just a seal. Caddies do that. This is brand new, though. How fiat are you gem"? Ohio. Hmm. Just a gasket. Nothing critical, but you're gonna wanna get it looked at when you get there. You the mechanic? It's my station. Everything here. And it's just you? Just me. Well, it was my daddy's. Died last year of the black lung. So, New Year's Eve. Yup. You from around here? Born and raised. We're from Alabama. Saw that. You know, he's in the music business. I'm not, though. $6. A 50? Got anything smaller than this? Sorry. You sure that's all you got? I only have three 5's and a stack of 1's. Do you want me to buy something else? Don't really matter. We'll be closed tomorrow anyway. Are you celebrating tonight? Nothin' to celebrate. Not this year. How about it just being over, then? I might drink to that. Stop talking. You made me lose count. Sorry about that. Damn. What is it? I only got $42. We're even? Deal. My name's Silas. Wanda. It's very nice to meet you, Silas. Happy New Year. Good night. If you was to drink to this year being over, where exactly might you do that? Dirty Johns. Honky-tonk up the 56 outside of Mount Hope. About all there is between here and Ohio. Well, I'd like to have that drink with you, Wanda. You and your friend from the music business? Thanks, but I gotta do the books. You know, I ain't never asked a girl out before. I reckon I was about scared half to death what you just said. But now that you did, I don't know what I was so scared of. It's New Year's Eve. Why don't you let ol' Luke buy you a drink somewhere? No, Luke. Tonight, I'm buying. Oh, I can't help it if I'm still in love with you I'm going from Reno down to Chino with a beautiful Latino that I stole from Kino Gino when he lost his poker face How he'll get up to Fargo I'll sure be damned if I know Evening, boys. Fellas. Oh, let's go! My woman left me back in Tahoe for a man they call Diablo I'd like to say I miss her so but it's a sin to lie 'Cause that darling little Sheila's You look like you never been honky-tonking before. Well, I haven't. Well, it's tricky. But I'll talk you through it. When we got to San Diego said her llamo was Consuelo She no speak Americana and I don't hablo Mexican Well, it's a good thing that she was pretty 'cause when we pulled into that city I found out she was all woman And boy, she knew I was all man Happy New Year, Sorbonne. Happy New Year. Let's take it home. You ever played in a place like this? About 1,000, I reckon. Gonna get your guitar? No, I think I better save that for tomorrow. Mr. O'Keefe will meet us there. How'd he take it when you told him I wasn't gonna make Charleston? He wasn't too happy. No. I guess he wouldn't be. He had to cash in a few favors to get me a book there. This may come as a surprise to you, Sorbonne, but I have a reputation of being a bit of a problem child. I ain't never had a friend, Sorbonne. Ever I don't know the first thing about loyalty 'cause I ain't never seen it. I'm sorry about Tennessee. I was thinking about what you said earlier. Maybe driving's a good business to be in. Well, you passed your audition. You made it two days with me, and you're still here. That's better than anybody, so far. I saw you talkin' to that little thing at the fillin' station. I asked her out. You did what? She said no. Well, that don't mean nothin'. That's part of a woman's schoolin', you know? They always say no on the first go-round. She didn't mean it. I think she meant it. Mmm-mmm. No, I saw her watchin' you, and now I know why. This is a threshold moment for you, Sorbonne. I want you to take my Cadillac, and go back to that fillin' station and get you a date for New Year's. Mr. Wells, look at me. All the money I got is yours in an envelope. She can smell what side of town I come from. And besides, she said no. She has to do her books. On New Year's Eve? All right. You go and get that woman. And you get to keep this on top of everything else. Now, if you don't get her, you don't get paid for nothin'. That's not the deal we made. You just ask Mr. O'Keefe what a son of a bitch I can be, in case you suddenly have cause to doubt. I can't leave you here alone. I'll be all right. OI' Luke, he can fend for himself pretty good. Thought you said all they did was tear our hearts out? Well, hell, you gotta die of somethin'. I'll be back. My delta queen, Ilene How are you? I'm fine. How are you this evening? We're just passin' through. From here, there. From everywhere. We are drivin' through on our way up from Alabama to Charleston. Oh, I love Alabama. It's so pretty. I love that state. It's a great state. Sorry. Don't mind him. He's just my ex-husband. I hope I'm not causing any trouble. No. He's just more of a nuisance than anything. Is that right? Stop it! Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? He's sick. If he's so sick, then why is he dancing with my wife? Ex-wife, Leroy! Asshole! You wanna go again? You done or you want some more? That's enough of that crap. It's almost New Year's. Now, get in here and enjoy yourselves. Hey, you okay? Get me to the car. Okay. Is he okay? He'll be fine. What happened? What in the hell do you think happened? He sucker punched me. Well, let's just get out of here. I'll find you a hotel. Not so fast, Sorbonne. I'll be fine. I'll just be a second. The hell, you say. I stopped off at the river, Tonto. Filled my canteen. If you're back in less than an hour, you're fired. Is he okay? He's about the same. I changed my mind. Well, I'm glad. You sure this is champagne? Hillbilly champagne. Cheers, then. Lord! Yeah. Old Ned Brown's. You can taste his radiator every time. I never done anything like this before. What, drink moonshine? You know what I mean. I just... I didn't wanna, you know... Hey, do you like this music? Yeah, it's all right, I guess. Would you dance with me? Even if I ain't much good? How do you know you're not? I ain't never done it before. Just go like you did in that fight out there, but slower and a lot less hittin'. Okay. I introduced him to my loved one And while they were dancin' my friend stole my sweetheart from me I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz Oh, I know just how much I have lost For I lost my little darling the night they were playin' the beautiful Tennessee Waltz The beautiful Tennessee Waltz All right, y'all! It's almost New Year's! Let's count 'er down. Come on. Five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind? Thanks for asking me. Thanks for being here. You should probably get back to your friend. Okay- And auld lang syne Have fun in Ohio and if you ever come back through, maybe you'll stop for gas. Sure. It would be good to see you. Happy New Year, Silas. Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot Mr. Wells? We'll get warm in here in just a minute. You reckon there is any coffee to be had in there? I'll go check. I really appreciate this. It's the least I could do after the free floor show you boys give us last night. I sure do apologize for that. I saw him play in Shreveport once. You know, a man came after him on the stage for the same damn thing. I guess trouble just seems to find that ol' boy. But like I need to tell you. Yeah. It's on me. Thank you. And this too. Now, you tell him that my stage is his any damn time he wants it. I'll do that. Thank you very much, sir. All right. You have a good one. You too.

Tell me of a home far beyond the skies Oh, they tell me of a home far away Oh, they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day Oh, the land of cloudless day I gotta pull in here for a scraper. I can't see a thing out of this windshield. Oh, the land of an unclouded sky Oh, they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise Sorbonne. Yeah? You said Mr. O'Keefe is gonna be there waitin' for us? Yeah, that's what he said. Are you my friend, Sorbonne? Sure. Are you really? Yeah, Luke. I'm your friend. I really am. I'm gonna go in here, and get a scraper and we'll get right back on the road, okay? Open wide thine arms of love Lord, I'm coming home Lord I'm coming home I sure do appreciate this. It shouldn't take me but a second. I got at least 100. Over at the bank, we give 'em out free. Compliments First National. You want a calendar? No, this'll do me just fine. I'll help you. That's okay. I've taken enough of your time. Hell, I don't mind. Earl's about to speak, and he's about as exciting as watchin' paint dry. I just come for the singin'. This ol' boy looks like he's in a little trouble there. He just had a rough night. You know, New Year's and all. If you say so. All right, that should be enough. Thank you. That's yours. Be careful out there. We sure will. Thanks again. God bless you. Both of you. ...broadcasting system. Elected Vice President Richard M.

Hey, Luke, time to wake up. I gotta find us a place to eat. You ever been here before? Come on, Luke, time to wake up. Mr. O'Keefe's waitin' for us in Canton, and he's madder than hell at the both of us already. Luke! Luke. Hey, Mr. Wells. Thank you. Thanks for your help. Looks like it was a heart attack. He had two broke ribs. Appreciate it. You give your statement? Yes, sir. Well, I guess it was a heart attack. But he had two broken ribs. What you know about that, son? Got into a fight last night over this woman. I never should've let him go in there, you know? I knew he was feeling bad. I let him have moonshine, and whiskey and beer. And I left him alone for a while. I'm really sorry, Mr. O'Keefe. I'm so sorry. You know, I traveled with him for six years, worked with him for 10. This was not the first time. I can promise you that. Now, he did this himself, okay? He didn't need a bit of help from you or anybody else. What happens now? Well, we'll take him back to Alabama, I guess. Need a driver? We'll handle it. But you might wanna steer clear of that vulture fight that's about to break out. I wish I could. We owe you some money. No, sir, I won't take it. I didn't do the job you hired me to do. You gave him what he wanted. He was the only one that wanted to do this trip. Besides, he said in his note to give you some money to buy a radio, whatever the hell that means. I got a lot to do before the family gets here. Should I wait for the police? I'll handle it. Could I get somebody to give me a ride to a bus station, then? Well, you ought to be able to get yourself there. What you do from there is your business. Now, I'm not a lawyer, and I don't know that he was ever of sound mind, but that's definitely his signature. Which means that you are the new owner of this automobile. I reckon something must've gone right out there. I can't. Why not? It was his to give. And there's plenty of it for the rest of them to fight over. Trust me. Should I go back there? Well, you can go wherever you wanna go. But I'd do it pretty quick, if I was you. You done good, Mr. Combs. You done good. Thank you. Harry Truman was our president A coke and burger cost you 30 cents I was still in love with Mavis Brown On the night Hank Williams came to town "I Love Lucy" debuted on TV That was one big event we didn't see 'Cause no one stayed at home for miles around it was the night Hank Williams came to town Momma ironed my shirt and Daddy let me take the truck I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up We hit that county line for one quick round On the night Hank Williams came to town A thousand people sweltered in the gym Then I heard someone whisper, "Hey, that's him" That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound it was the night Hank Williams came to town On and on, he sang into the night "Jambalaya," "Cheatin' Heart" "I Saw the Light" And how'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown on the night Hank Williams came to town? Remember, friends and neighbors, Hank Williams and all the Driftin' Cowboys... You don't have to come up poor on that red clay 'Bama land Or ride that o!' lost highway with a guitar in your hand But if you have a heartache that won't let go of you you might have the Hank Williams Blues Hank was only human just like me and you Ridin' in the back of that Cadillac in 1952 No one knows for certain but I believe it's true He had a bad case of the Hank Williams Blues Lord, when you got 'em You know by the pain You're hittin' on rock bottom out in that pouring rain Caught between everything Nothin' left to lose Lord, you've got the Hank Williams Blues Ashes to ashes Dust to dust Young turns to old like steel turns to rust And it comes just a little bit quicker when you're livin' the fast life The trail you're taking today Well, it could be your last ride Sooner or later, you meet your maker He's awaitin' somewhere down the line It ain't that far from your first breath till you say your last goodbye Well, a cowboy never mounts his horse on the good Lord's bad side 'Cause the trail you're takin' today Well, it could be your last ride
