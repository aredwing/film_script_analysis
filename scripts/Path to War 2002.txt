Great night, Mr. President. What a night. Senator Dirksen, the President would be delighted if you'd join him in the Oval Office after the ball. I will. One thing I can say about the Great Society: it sure is crowded! Up all night writing this one, Dick? Uh, this is one speech I'll gladly disavow. Got a clippin here. Quotes my honorable defeated opponent, Senator Goldwater. Calls my Secretary of Defense an IBM machine with legs! Outrageous! Now, I stand here tonight to tell you this, that I regard Bob McNamara here as not only one of the smartest but one of the most humane men I know. Right here. And that goes for all my blue ribbon men you see here tonight. Never in our history has there been such an abundance of brain and talent, why I've got three our four Rhodes scholars, four or five graduates of Harvard, a couple from Yale, and why, there's even one here tonight from Southwest Texas State Teachers College! And don't you know, that one rules the roost! Thank you. Watch broken, Jack? Timin it. Timin what? The applause. He'll ask. In a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty. In a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry. In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die unattended. In a great land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read and write. A bit more volume, please, Mr. President. I want to hear every brilliant word that Dick Goodwin wrote for your marvelous speech. Goodwin!? Who told you Goodwin wrote that speech? A dozen people work on my speeches, and nobody more than I do. Why Jack here's been writin some of my best stuff for seven years. My penance for marryin away his last secretary. But, thank you for the credit, Mr. President. All right, good night, Jack. Good night, Mr. President. Good night, Senator. Good night, Jack. Yeah, Goodwin wrote maybe a word or two. Mhm. Great being one. Society the other. Smart sonovabitch got that out of a book. Now, listen to me, Ev and listen well. You're a good friend, I don't want to see you retire prematurely. But as this reception plainly shows you, the American people ain't gonna stand for you fellahs in the other side of the isle draggin your feet in any of my programs. Now, FDR passed a handful of bills in his first hundred days. I'm gonna pass a bucketful. Poverty, education, healthcare. I'm gonna finish what I started on Civil Rights, too. I'm tellin ya, Jim Crow put a collar on more smart men, sure as they were sentenced to an Illinois chain gang. Whoa-whoa-whoa. I take offense, sir. We are most humane to our condemned. The Great Society is my beautiful woman, Ev, and I'm takin her by the arm. And as the greatest republican leader in this century, Edward Dirksen's gonna take her by the other and help me escort that lady home. Yes, and knowing what is likely thence to ensue, Mr. President, that is where I shall take my leave. Lyndon, I apologize for interruptin, I thought perhaps you'd like some sandwiches from the kitchen. Mrs. Johnson, my most abject apology. I have kept your husband far too long on this most festive occasion. No. Mr. President, my heartfelt congratulations, sir. Outta here. Good night. Good night. ...in abundance of what we'e learned from heartache. Democracy rests upon the people. Freedom is a gift, the judgment is God's... It was a wonderful speech. Full of such hope and promise. Dick Goodwin asked what I thought and I told him it was a magnificent job. And you delivered it so very well. Thank you, honey. Yes, you did Nine p.m. unless you hear from me. Good morning. How are you? Yes, thank you Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Secretary. What have we got here? A crisis in every capital? Uh, just one. This is one cable? Not quite. Here's the rest of it. The situation in Viet Nam is continuing to deteriorate, we've been able to keep the noise level down since your campaign but my guess is you'll be faced with a tough decision soon. How soon? I've got 19 million older folks can't see a doctor, 33 million under the poverty line, I can't have Congress distracted. Now how soon, Bob? Very soon, Mr. President. I hate to have to report this to you, but Max Taylor says here that Vietcong enlistment is increasing rapidly and that uh, Saigon can't continue must longer to provide security for our advisors down there and fight an insurgency at the same time. Why not? How many men does South Vietnam have out there fightin ? Two hundred thousand. VC have about thirtyfour thousand. Well, how the hell can thirty-four thousand lick two hundred thousand? Well, historically a ten to one ratio minimum is required for a guerrilla situation and there's no way that South Vietnam can achieve that on their own. Now, we've kept our powder dry through the elections and holidays waiting for some stability in the South, waiting for the cycle of coups to end, during which we've had five killed in the attack at Bien Hoa, two at our Saigon officers quarters and scores wounded with no retaliation from us whatsoever. Now, Wheeler, the other Chiefs, Westmoreland are fit to be tied, as you know, and now this from Ambassador Taylor. You might send Mac Bundy to Saigon to have a talk with him, I'd make another trip myself, but I'm in the middle of the defense budget right now. I don't want to see the word Vietnam in that damn budget. You know I'd do that if I could. In fact, it's becoming increasingly difficult to conceal-- Bob, all I want to know is this: What's it gonna take to get Ho Chi Minh to quit? That's all I wanna know. Mr. President, it's clear to me now that the answer is sustained military action in the air and if that doesn't work on the ground. This is the decision you are going to have to face, Mr. President and as I said, very soon I'm afraid. Keep me up to date, Bob. Turn that thing off. Yes, sir. This Medicare speech is shit. Cut out the gobbledygook and sex it up. Maybe Goodwin aughta take a crack at it. Goodwin's got three months of assignments. Oh, I just put the last of those on your desk, Mr. President. I'd be glad to look it over if you'd like me to. All right. Put the music to it, Dick. Jack, I want you to tell him to stop taking credit for every goddamn word I say. Absolutely, Mr. President. All right. Come on, out you go. Schedule me a hair cut. Surely. And see if you can get Clark Clifford here for dinner. Converting from Protestant to Catholic is a big step. Actually Lyndon took it better than I did. I was quite surprised. Well, both you and Daddy changed your religions. From one Protestant denomination to another. It was a matter of convenience, and schoolin and I don't think religion should be a matter of convenience. And this is a private matter, Luci. You're finishing up at Texas, aren't you, Lynda? Next year, Ma am. She's dating George Hamilton, you know. The actor? Yes. With the tan? And your sister may consider that a private matter, too. Oh, mother, you must be joking. Come on now, damn it, what's the reason this time? I don't have the qualifications to be CIA director. I decide the qualifications. You had all the qualifications to be Attorney General, didn't ya, to succeed Bobby Kennedy. Yeah. Yeah, and here I am stuck with a friend of his, Katzenbach. He's excellent. Ah, well all right you told me your interest is foreign affairs. Well, that's where I need your help, foreign affairs. What is CIA but foreign affairs? I think my skills would better serve you in foreign policy, Mr. President, not foreign intrigue. I hear you billed a million dollars last year, First lawyer in the country to do that. True? Well, that's what five percent came to. Well then, you can afford to take a hiatus from all this money-makin, come serve your president. I don't think you need an attorney, old friend. I think you need a magician. A magician? Yes. Someone who can make a small corner of Southeast Asia disappear. President Kennedy did not lose South Vietnam and I'm not gonna lose South Vietnam. I kept all these people on, they assured me, told me to stick it out. Now, that little sonovabitch Bobby is just hovering to swoop down and reclaim the mantle if I fail. He'll hang me from my left ball, Goldwater hang me from my right. That is complete nonsense. You humiliated Goldwater in the election. The entire Right wing is in disarray, Bobby is a freshman Senator with no record. His brother was a no record Senator too, wasn't he, when he came out of no where? Daddy? Would you like some desert or are you on your diet? Oh, now, now, you save some for me if it's good. How about you, Mr. Clifford? No, thank you. No, he's not gettin anything tonight. Now, Jack Kennedy put sixteen thousand advisers in there, I put in another eight. We've got twentyfour thousand men teachin them people how to shoot and fly planes. We've got patrols and covert operations, we've got an alphabet soup of aid programs, a lot of which I'd like to have right here and none of it's workin because with all this coup shit it's like buildin bricks with no mortar down there, there's nothin real to hang it all on. Now, Ho Chi Minh knows this and he's gonna keep his people attackin until there's nothin left. Now, if we call it quits and continue as we are, South Vietnam, maybe the whole of Southeast Asia goes communist. Eh-eh, now even George all admits that. Everybody else thinks we aught to up the ante. Bombing? Look at this. A bunch of sheds, just outside on the water. And they call that a military target. There's school right up the street, Poles built it for em. Hell, Clark, I could build em a thousand damn schools. I'd like you to start to follow the situation down there, read some of these reports they keep throwin at me. Eh, I just don't know what to believe any more biggest damn mess. And bein on the outside you could take a fresh look. I'll do everything I can to help. Yeah, except come work for me. Hey, what about the Supreme Court, what if a seat opens up? I'm an advocate, I'm not a judge. Hell, Clark, you're a hick lawyer from Missouri. Well, I may be a hick lawyer from Missouri, But as you yourself pointed out I haven't made Missouri wages for a long, long time. You know, I ran sayin I was for peace, now sure as hell, they're tellin me I gotta do what I said I wasn't gonna do. What Goldwater was gonna do. Luci's converting to Catholicism. Big decision for a young girl. He told me. He said when the press gets wind they'll make it sound as if she did it as a tribute to the Kennedy's. I swear I think he was only half joking. Clark? Hello? I'm sorry, he's asleep. He just got over neumonia, I'd rather not wake him. I... I know, is it possible... Marg? Sorry, Bob, must be pretty damn bad to keep you at home. Let's just call it the Hanoi flu. What the hell's goin on here? General. Corps Head Quarters at Pleiku. Vietcong cut through the wire, blew up our advisers barracks, planes and choppers on the runway and Camp Holloway. Casualty report. More of the same, advisers compound next door. VC got in with mortar and grenade launchers. There are eight dead, a hundred and twenty plus wounded, six choppers, one transport destroyed other aircraft severely damaged. Mr. Secretary? The National Security Advisors in Saigon, is he not? Didn't the CIA say Hanoi would connect Bundy's visit with a decision on bombing? Vietcong agents in Saigon government probably leaked it out. And knowing this, knowing this look what they did, Bob. They blew up a hundred and twentyeight people just to thumb their noses at us. Now what the hell are we going to do about it? Number 33, the North Vietnamese barracks at Dong Hoi just over the border in North Vietnam, about six thousand troops based there An isolated facility with minimal civilian support. What are the expected casualties? Thirty six hundred troops, uh, roughly forty civilians. How'd you come up with these numbers? Sir, we take the approach, look at the blast pattern, size of the blast, demographics... Mr. President, it's a sophisticated an analysis as I've seen, unprecedented in aerial warfare. Well, Ho Chi Minh's not gonna turn tail overnight. Saigon's gonna take a shellackin for anything we do. And if they go in now it'd be like sendin in a widow woman to slap Jack Dempsey. Sir, we doubt Hanoi will slap back. Didn't MacArthur say the same thing when a million Chinese poured into Korea? What does State think of this? The risk of inaction means more aggression, Ambassador Taylor concurs. He's meeting with Saigon's leaders now and should be calling the Situation Room momentarily. They'll put him through to me. Mr. President, if I might. I was in charge of bombing survey's during World War'II, And bombing never wins a war. Rather than erode the enemy's will it strengthens it, we've seen this time and time again, in the Blitz, Berlin. Well, Blitz and Berlin never woulda happened If we didn't lay down to Hitler's Munich. And if we lay down now it'll be the same thing again. An open invitation to more of their aggression. Mr. President, what we're proposing with Rolling Thunder is a strictly limited program of sustained retaliation moving Northward only if Vietcong act vity persists. But it will persist, Bob. We'll be bombing their cities before we know it, now do we expect Russia to sit still for that? Or China? Comparisons with Korea fifteen years ago are flimsy at best, Mr. President. You are absolutely right. China has atomic weapons now. They tested their first bomb four months ago, it was no dud. We have no idea what will set them off. I, I don't understand. Why is this? North Vietnam has secret treaties with the Chicoms, Mr. President. We don't know what the flashpoints are in their intervention. We could take China out in seventeen minutes. They'd be crazy to take us on. I agree, Bus, but why assume they're as rational as we are? Mr. President, four hundred Americans have died in Vietnam, and now eight more in these atrocities, there has to be a response to this aggression. Mr. President, the Air Force will be launching strikes from the Danang airfield, and that base will become a more attractive target to the Vietcong. General Westmoreland is requesting a Hawk missile battalion. Is he asking for troops? No. No troops. Saigon will be responsible for a base defense but if the Vietcong activity intensifies despite these measures, they may need some help. But it will intensify, Bob! This is precisely my point, Mr. President. Yes? Defense Secretary, Saigon, Ambassador Taylor. Put him through. Max, we're all here with President Go ahead. Mr. President, gentlemen, Saigon has agreed to the commencement of air strikes. They say their army's ready for any counterattack from the North. All right, Max. Thank you. George... your concerns are mine, as well as you know but we're no where nea the point you suggest, and many here agree there's a good chance that Ho Chi Minh will quit if we start makin him pay. Now is there anyone here who does not agree with this? I'm concerned about the press. They're gonna view this as a change in policy. There is no change in policy. But we haven't struck back since the Tonkin Gulf affair six months ago. That's right, that's when I asked Congress for the power, they gave me the power, now I'm usin it. But we're takin it slow. I'm not goin to Hanoi. And I'm signin off on every target. You're not gonna bomb the smallest outhouse without checking with me. You understand, General? We understand, Mr. President. All right, Bob, you better get goin. Now, anything else? From Robert'S. McNamara to Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp, Commander Pacific Forces, Honolulu. This is an execution order. During daylight hours, 7 February 1965, Saigon time, conduct the following coordinated attacks: Number 33 X Dong Hoi barracks... Good evening, Mr. President. Planes back? Uh, the carriers weren't on station when the order went out, sir. The operation has been delayed. Delayed? About ninety minutes, sir. We should have word shortly. At ease. What happened? It's monsoon season there, sir. Well are they goin or aren't they goin !? You find out what the hell's goin on and you call me. Get the White House operator to put you through. You want me to wake you, sir? You won't wake me! Why you up? Worried for you. Those planes should a been back hours ago. What's that? Letter from a friend complainin about junkyards. She says here... they're all up and down the highway now through Dallas to San Antonio and Houston to Austin... Right on the highway or away where people can't see? No, right along the road defilin the countryside. Through Waxahachie and Hillboro, and lovely San Marcos where you went to school. Oh. Love... don't.... Love. Yes, Mr. President? What are you do in about junkyards on the highways? What? Junkyards! Well, I'm sendin somethin over to your office right now. You jump in your car in your jammies you might even beat it. Yes? I spoke with Honolulu, they're cabling now. Planes are back, the primary was hit. All the planes, they all get back? Uh, no, sir. I'm afraid we did lose one plane. What about the pilot? He went down at sea, Search and Rescue is looking for him now but I'm afraid it's not looking very good. I'm sorry, sir. All right, thank you, Bob. Good night, Mr. President. Yes, Mr. President? Lyndon. Oh, I'm sorry. Put this on Moyer's desk. Yes, sir. Honey? We lost a pilot. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Oh, I'm so sorry. This isn't about junkyards, is it? Shit, what time is it? I told Sandra I'd be home before one. She didn't call. That's not a good sign. What about you, you coming or going? He wants company. We started bombing North Vietnam tonight. Christ. Are they talking about combat troops? No. Not yet. No. Christ, I don't know what to tell the press. We are backing into a war here, for Christ's sake and it's a war he campaigned against. But now, he talks like he's puttin a paddle to Ho Chi Minh's behind. Nah, Johnson's a deal maker. He's the best politician this country's ever seen, he'll find a way out of this. Sure, we'll just get old Uncle Ho down to the ranch, serve him up some tasty barbecue and then offer him a damn. Or a Federal Judgeship. Hello, Mr. President. Good evening, Mr. President. Congratulations on getting that education bill out of committee. Well, it hasn't passed yet, has it? I want all ya up there on the hill day and night to get me those yeas. What is this? Tapioca puddin ? Yes, sir. Would you like it? Ah, now, votin rights, that's the meat in the coconut, boys. Where do we stand? Um, at last tally we are short fifty congressmen. But the Senate is-- Start with the house give me the names. You want me to read the roll, Mr. President, All four hundred and thirty-five? From Abbitt of Virginia to Zablocki of Wisconsin. Go. Um, Abbit, Virginia, nay. Abernethy, Mississippi, nay. Where do you think you're goin ? Home. The hell you are. You're gonna relieve him when he gives out. Adair, Indiana, nay. Adams, Washington yah. Adabbo, New York, yah. Albert, Okalahoma, yah. Boys, it doesn't look like we're gonna be able to get votin rights through. Not this session. Well, I must say I don't understand, Mr. President. Only a month ago in your State of the Union message, you made it perfect... Reverend King, I've been to the well and the well has provided. I got the votes on Medicare, aid to education, all these benefit the poor and the disenfranchised and you know who that is. Please don't misunderstand, we're very grateful, Mr. President. Attorney General Katzenbach here's written a beautiful piece of legislation. You think I wanna carry that around in my ass pocket? You see it's this, this problem I got in Southeast Asia, The Vietnamese to them Southerners up on the Hill, what are they but another bunch of colored people. And I go up there crawlin for more aid as I must for Vietnam, Mr. President, old Wilbur Mills will say, you're gonna have to raise taxes. Declare war, call up the reserves. And by the way, that's gonna cost you your War on Poverty, your votin rights for Negros. Just like World War II killed the New Deal, well there ain't gonna be World War III, I promise you. I'm gonna nip this in the bud, I am. And as soon as I do, I'll send that bill up and more, I promise you. There will be no delay. Well, Mr. President, we're going to be down in Selma, marching for the vote, and we expect you'll take notice to what we do down there. During preparations for Martin Luther King's second attempt to march to Montgomery, four white men beat to death a Boston clergyman, one of the fifteen hundred marchers. The slain reverend, James Reed, had come to Selma in solidarity with Negroes attempting to register to vote. Amidst growing concern about increasing racial violence in Alabama, Governor George Wallace is reportedly preparing a trip to Washington D.C. to see the President. Meanwhile, demonstrations continue in front of the White House. Call em off! Well, we didn't organize it, Mr. President. Call em off, get out there, both of ya! Call em off! Daddy? Why you up? Those goddamn agitators wake you? No, I heard you yellin . Oh, sorry, honey. ....always find ways to tell you how it can't be done. It ' still strange to us though how millions of dollars can be spent everyday to hold troops in South Vietnam and our country cannot protect the rights of Negros in Selma and Marian, Alabama! He's outrageous! So we have... Now! Now! Now! Everything's gotta be now. What they want the whole goddamn world with a fence around it? I just gave Standby authorization to Federalize the Alabama Guard, we just need your order. We have to do it, Mr. President. Wallace won't protect those marchers. Hold-hold on, you want me to send troops into Alabama, lose Stennis, Dirksen, Russell, every conservative vote I got hangin on a thread of a spittle!? It'll be Reconstruction all over again! Hell, your friend Bobby Kennedy coulda given me that advice! Governor George Wallace of the Alabama State Legislature... Martin Luther King and his group of procommunists have instigated these demonstrations by lawless nigger mobs in Birmingham. But the law abidin citizens of both races there are fed up with this riotin and disruption led by so-called clergy men and their communist inspired values! I am therefore sending two hundred and fifty state troopers into that city supported y five hundred law officers of this state. I will meet our enemies face to face. I will not surrender! Mr. President, Wallace is only coming up here in order to placate you. He wants things to get so bad down there that you have to put the troops in. Then he'll lambaste you for invading his sovereign state and that's how he'll save himself. Goddamn runty little bastard! I want his pecker in my pocket. The thing we have to do, we have to get him to ask for the troops to say he wants rights, he wants peace, but he just can't control his own people. Make it his failure, that's what we ought to do. In an interview today, Governor Wallace denies that Alabama State Troopers and Sheriff's Deputies used unnecessary force in routing Negro marchers in Selma. Call the Speaker. Tell him I want to address Congress. On television. That goddamn bill is goin up now. One more, Governor Wallace. A little closer. Thank you. All right, right here, let's sit down, Governor. Over here, that's it. Over there, oooh, right in the corner. The corner, Governor, that's it. All right, Governor, you wanted to see me? Uh, yes, uh, Mr. President. I want to thank you for agreeing to see me... Goddamn demonstrators! Keepin Lady Bird up, disturbin my daughters rest. Turn that thing off! Subversives, most of em. Communist party's behind the whole thing. You know what I'd do, I'd send some of them secret service boys out there with itchin powder. Sprinkle it on the back of some of their necks, they'd drop them signs they're carryin, scratch themselves raw.. That's a great idea. I'm gonna get my people on that. Better than that, Governor, we aughta go out there. We got all of those television cameras, you see this television camera I got out there? Yes, sir. Why don't we go out there and we turn them cameras around and we'll announce that youm decided to register every Negro in Alabama? Mr. President, as much as I... Nick, give me one of them Constitutions. Yes, sir. Nick's got the Constitution. Eh, thank you, Nick. Now, Governor, I'm sure that somewhere in here it says that Negros have the right to vote. Ah, yes, Mr. President. And uh, they have the right to vote in Alabama, but uh, it's the County Registrars, they uh, they under Alabama law they independent and I don't have the power. George... now don't you shit me about who's got the power in Alabama. Mr. President. Now, come on, Governor. You're a persuasive man. Hell, I was watchin you this mornin on all three networks. You were attackin me. I wasn't attackin you, Mr. President, I was attackin the idea. Idea, hell, you were attackin me, George, and I'll tell ya, you're so damn persuasive, I nearly changed my mind. You have marvelous powers of persuasion, don't you, Governor. Governor Wallace, you and I shouldn't be sittin here, thinkin about 1965, we aught to be thinkin about 1995, when you and I will be long in our graves. Now you got a lot of poor people down there in Alabama, a lot of ignorant people. People who need jobs, people who need a future. You could do a lot for em. In 1995, Governor, what do you want left behind? You want a great big marble monument sayin George Wallace, he built, he protected the weak, the poor, the impoverished people of this great state? Or do you want a little piece of scrawny pine layin there in the harsh, caliche soil sayin, George Wallace, he hated. I'm sorry, Governor. I interrupted you. Now, you wanted to tell me something? Mr. President, I uh, I've had the opportunity to uh, reevaluate and uh... I think that uh, I just may not be able to get things under control without some uh, assistance. Governor, I'll give you any assistance that's mine to provide. Now, what specific measures would you suggest? The President and I have spoken and uh, I have assured him that I abhor brutality and in my total commitment to law and order, I will do whatever it takes to uh, maintain the peace. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States. I speak tonight to the dignity of men and the destiny of democracy. There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem. There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma. The cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government. Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man. This Wednesday, I will send you a law which will eliminate illegal barriers to the most basic American right, the right to vote. Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex, and most difficult about this there can and should be no argument, for outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation and the harsh judgment of history. Because of the American Negro, to secure for himself the full blessings of American life, must be our cause. Because really, it is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome. Dick, ninety three million on TV, it's a record. Congratulations, Thanks. Hey, Dick, Dick, the switchboard is jammed haven't had this many calls since't he Cuban Missile Crisis. Hmm, at least we know they don't only call to complain. Hey, Dick, sit down, sit down. That was ole Dick Russell. Says I'm a low-down cur and a turncoat but he wants me to know that's the best speech he ever saw any president give and that goes back to Lincoln! Mr. President, it's Dr. King. Oh, Dr... Oh, Reverend King, that's kind of you to call. Did you know I was on TV tonight? Oh, oh, you saw it? Yeah. Okay, All right. I understand. Yeah. Bye. Bye. You've got Arthur Crimm on Line 3, sir. Oh, no-no-no. No, no, I can't. No, no, no. No. You know, boys, I'm reminded tonight of Texas hill country in spring. Oh, Lyndon, your guests are far too weary to appreciate your poetry. Now let me tell you boys about the hill country in the spring. Good night. Good night, all. Good night, Mrs. Johnson. Good night. Luci. Now, in the spring... Luci. Come with me. Good night. Good night, Mrs. Johnson. Good night. In the spring, in the hill country, the sun is up early and the ground gets warmer, and you can see the steam risin and the sap drippin. And in his pen, there's my prize bull. Now he is the biggest... Best hung bull in the hill country. Well, in the spring that bull gets a hankerin for them cows and he starts pawin the ground and gettin restless. So I open up the pen and he goes down the hill with his pecker hangin hard and swingin . Well, those cows get so goddamn excited, they get more and more moist to receive him and their asses just start quiverin they start quiverin all over every one of em is quiverin ! And as that bull struts into their pasture, oooh, boys, ha-ha we had em quiverin tonight! Arriving in Naval transports, United States Marines storm the beaches in Danang Vietnam in full battle gear. These are the first U.S. ground troops to step foot on Asian soil since the Korean War. They were greeted by some lovely local ladies. The Pentagon says their mission is a defensive one, to protect the U.S. air base from enemy attack so Operation Rolling Thunder can roll on. Speaking with reporters, President Johnson emphasized that these thirty-five hundred marines will free up the South Vietnamese troops now guarding the base to go out and fight Vietcong. Reports from the field, however, indicate that Saigon forces may be no match for full Vietcong regimen. Recently, in one of the heaviest attacks of the war so far, the Vietcong inflicted major casualties in Quai Nang Province. Unofficial sources say that many South Vietnamese army units are near collapse. Oh, my, oh, my. Mr. President. Mr. President. All right, sit down, sit down boys. I, I heard you fellahs were talkin over dinner. Can I get you a plate of food, Mr. President? No, thank you. Drink? No. Why? Why do they want war with us? To Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese this is just a continuation of the war with the French, and the Japanese, and the Chinese a thousand years before that. We never should have allowed the French to reclaim their colonies in 45, but we needed them aligned with us against the Soviets and that was their price. Will we end up like the French? A great power cuttin and runnin from a bunch a little men in black pajamas, tuckin our tail in defeat? France didn't have the fire power we have. But the bombing seems to have no affect. Well, it appears now that it won't stop them, but it has slowed down their resupply. Hanoi's starting to send down large units and the more of their men we can tie up with repairing roads and bridges, the fewer they can spare to fight the South. What do we have there now? Well, we've got the 3rd Marines at Danang, Phu Bai, Chu Lai, the 173rd Airborne at Vung Tau, for base defense and support of the South Vietnamese units 13 battalions in all. Never mind battalions, how many boys? Fifty-one thousand troops, Mr. President. Yeah, and Westmorel and wants how many? One hundred eighty-four thousand. And the authority to launch offensive operations under his own command. The South Vietnamese are useless, Mr. President. They've lost four battalions in a month. Desertions are at record levels. They're losing and they're losing fast. National Security Advisor I know they're losin ! I don't need a Phi Beta Kappa key to know they're losin ! Anyone smart enough to pour piss out of a boot knows they're losin ! How many casualties you think we'll take? We could reach 500 a month by the end of the year if Hanoi hasn't quit by then. Five hundred a month? You tell Westmorel that he's got the authority. Tell him to get out there and kill Vietcong, and do whatever he has to do to hold em off. Then you and Wheeler go and see him and nail him down on what he needs to get this thing over with. Then damn it, let's get it over with! U.S. Command Center, Saigon Kid was setting fuses on the goddamn bridge, do you believe it? I was five minutes away. And that potshot last time I was here he missed me by a mile. Jesus, you'd think they'd put their best sniper on the job. I wish I could tell you they were representative of the enemy Mr. Secretary. My strategy for the war is divided into three phases. In Phase I, employing the 184,000 man level now being considered, we would halt the losing trend by the end of 1965. In Phase II, for which an additional 100,000 troops would be needed, allied forces would gain the initiative by June 30, 1966, pacification activities would be expanded aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the South Vietnamese peasantry. If the Communists do not then give up Phase III of our strategy would kick in the win phase, which would being on July 1, 1966 and conclude by December 31, 1967 the defeat of remaining enemy forces and base areas. Additional reinforcements will be needed for this phase, following which allied forces will begin to be withdrawn. General, that's a marvelous plan, but uh, excessively abstract. I want to see your numbers. I want to see the percentage of the country you now control, The percentage intend to control with these 200,000 additional men. I want to see rates of infiltration and interdiction, force ratios in each of the tactical corps zones and enemy casualties in battles fought and projected battles against these added forces. Mr. Clifford, The President on Line One. Old friend, I need you here. Whatever resources are lost through bombing or capture, China and Russia will make up with resupply, encouraging a friendly game of I'm more revolutionary than though Our intervention will give them a cause over which to unite when it is in our interest to deepen the breach between them. Wouldn't we lose credibility throughout the world if we give up as you propose? Wouldn t this be an irreparable blow, George? A worse blow, Mr. President, would be that the mightiest power in the world is unable to defeat one of the most backward. With the seventy-one battalions, with Westy's plan, this war is winnable. I say we go in and we get the job done. But can we get the job done? What if they put their stack in? What makes you think if we put in the numbers you're suggesting that Ho Chi Minh won't match us man for man? This means greater bodies of men, Mr. President, Which will allow us to cream them. Their firepower against ours... Why does anyone think that they will accommodate us by fighting our kind of war? Their tactics are terror, and sniping they have better access to intelligence. Why is this? It's because the South Vietnamese government is heavily infiltrated with Vietcong agents, Mr. President. What other road can we go, negotiations, stopping the bombing? These make us look weak, with cup in hand. Better to lose now than after committing 200,000 men. I disagree. We have to make a stand here, and if we fail it could be chalked up to any number of things corruption amongst Saigon's leaders for instance, then we can get out. But this government would have stood up to the Communists. But we won't get out, Bob, we will double our bet and get massacred in the rice paddies So-so-so-so, what's you're advice, George? Cut and run? Mr. President, no great captain in history ever hesitated to make a tactical withdrawal when conditions were unfavorable to him. Does anyone else here agree with what George is sayin ? I've asked Clark Clifford to join us. Clark, you have any comments at this time? I, I have a question for General Wheeler. Yes, sir. Good morning, General. Good morning. If the President proceeds with this plan, what in your view would constitute a victory? What is the definition of victory in this contest? Yes. A military victory in the traditional sense is not what we are seeking. To eliminate every last Vietcong guerilla, could require as many as half a million men and five years... N-n-no one, no one's considerin those kinda numbers, no one. Our objective is to reach a stalemate whereby we are attriting the enemy faster than he can replace his loses, this is the so-called cross-over point. And how many men will this require? A substantially smaller number. Depending on how the North Vietnamese respond. Well, might they respond by sending in, say, 100,000 troops? We regard this as unlikely. Well, it's less than half the men they have under arms. Well, it's certainly possible, they already have 50,000 men down there. And to achieve the ten to one superiority? Which I understand is barely adequate for conventional forces in a guerilla situation. How many troops would be required to meet this possible threat? As I said, this would be unlikely. One million troops, is that not correct, General? You see, we would need one million men in Vietnam. Excuse me Clark... I can't tell you how grateful I am to finely have an alley at the barricades. Well, it's just what makes sense, George. Not to Bob McNamara but to me. A million men was straight-out of your memo of October last year. An impressively persuasive document in my opinion. All sixty-seven pages of it. Well... I haven't shown much restraint on the subject, it's true. If he brought you in, it must be because I'm like an old broken record now. Well, then that'd be two of us. Scratchy and irritating as hell. Good day, George. Yeah? The Vista Volunteers are here for the pictures, Mr. President. All right, tell em I'll be out in a minute. And tell Goodwin I wanna see him right after. I called Marg soon as I knew you were safe. Cowards. I really appreciate that, she was pretty shaken up. She hates my work Well, I hate sendin ya. The whole thing stinks to high heaven What'd you wanna tell me in private? I've managed to keep these Vietnam expenditures under wraps as you requested, but if you decide to move forward with this, it's going to be impossible to keep up the guise indefinitely and I strongly believe you should present this bill to the American people. No, absolutely not. Mr. President, I can't continue to hide these kinds of figures. Phase I of Westmoreland's program alone is going to run us twelve billion dollars. Twelve billion!? I can't ask Congress for twelve billion dollars! Mr. President. Bob, it'll be unshirted hell if I go to the Hill askin for that kind of money. I'll never get another thing out of em again. Now how much can you trim off that? Bob, I've got my ox in a ditch here. Now, what can you do for me? If we continue to use the maximum transfer authority from other areas, I could probably cut these figures in half, but we'd still need a big appropriation to carry us through this year. But Westmoreland says if we put the men in, there's a chance they'll quit by year's end, right? Well, that's certainly what we all hope, but we can't count on West... You just do the number countin, will ya, Bob? Yeah. Get as low as you can. One more. All right. All right, thank you, thank you. Dick, I need a statement for next week. I'm not sure yet if I'm gonna want to use it, but I need it ready. All right, Mr. President. You know, Jack, I want war like I want polio the shootin, the bombin goes against every bone in my body. You know that better than almost anyone. These young people here, that's what I'm all about. That was me, in Cotulla teachin Mexican kids livin in hovels, treated worse than you'd treat a dog. But here I start a billion dollar bank for em in Southeast Asia, free money, and Ho Chi Minh wants no part of it. I could a turned that place into the Tennessee Valley. I read he said he's willin to fight for twenty years. I know what he says and I know what I say and I know what I must do despite what I say, damn it! I want to leave the footprint of America in Vietnam, schools, dams, hospitals. Bomb craters that'll be our footprint That's what they'll remember me for. Not civil rights or health care or education. No, sir, it'll be Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam. Twenty bills I'm tryin to get out of committee, and twelve outta eighteen workin hours everyday, my head's stuck up that raggedy-ass little fourth-rate country that doesn't even have the fight to save itself. You get with McNamara, you know what it's gotta say and tell Buzzby or Goodwin we gotta put the music to it, Jack. Why you up? You needn't ask me that each time. Ah, I tried not awake ya. I got the ringer so low I can't hear it, and I got the flashlight. Maybe you oughta sleep in that other room you set up. What happened to that Prime Rib from the Medicare meetin ? Is that what you want? There's a nice chicken left from the Education Lunch. I saw em put it away. Oh, darlin you been so good about your diet, I don't see any point in the middle of the night... I don't care about that now! Another heart attack might be the answer to my problems. All right, you stop that kinda talk please, I worry enough about your health. I'll fix somethin for you if you sit down. All right. Come on. All right. I'm sorry. Luci met a boy. When she went on that Chicago trip with you last week. What do you mean she met a boy!? Why didn't I know about this? That day she went to Milwaukee and visited the William Feldsteins. She visited Beth Jenkins at Marquette and Beth had some friends over, all the students there and among them was this... boy, Patrick Nugent is his name. He's Catholic. Luci will only date boys who are Catholic now and she calls him Paddy. Thank you. So I am payin attention. He's just tons, mother. She said to me. That's the new expression, tons. Move your elbow. Thank you. Yeah. You like the chicken? You remarked on it. I didn't know of it. You might have shown it to me this mornin . And woken you again? Oh. Like a jack ass in a hailstorm. I guess I'll just have to hunker up and take it. I feel like I'm goin down in a plane, and I can crash with it and burn up, or jump and die. Where we were when I came in, I, I'd trade back to that. I'd trade back to the damn vice-presidency to get outta this mess. Clark, the President would like you and your wife to join him at Camp David this weekend. Oh, thank you, Bill. Thank the President. We'd love to, but we have a prior engagement. Clark, is there anyway you can make it? He's working on an escalation speech? Has he made up his mind? I'd say he has but he's asking for you. And who else will be there? Bob McNamara. Bob. Mr. and Mrs. McNamara, I'd like you to meet my friend, Pat Nugent. It's an honor to meet you, sir. Pleasure. My wife, Marg. Nice to meet you. You're in National Guard, where you stationed? I'll be at Andrews with the 113th, sir, but down to San Antonio first for basic. Ah, Lackland Air Force Base, sure. Used to call it Kelly back in 42 when I was goin around helpin to build an Air Force in this country. You know, we only had a handful of planes when the Japanese attacked us, spread all over the country. Is that right? And Hap Arnold knew every one of em by name. I have some Hap Arnold stories for you. Uh, sorry, we'll leave everything till tomorrow, we'll talk in the morning. I look forward to it. Come on in. Let the best minds of our administration start looking for a way out and stop looking for a way to win this unwinnable war, because it is my considered opinion, that continuing on that path will lead us to catastrophe. Any unbiased jury would give you your verdict, Clark, no question. Good. But, if it's true what Moyer says; that Lyndon's in McNamara's pocket... McNamara has such sway in there. Truman took your advice over George Marshalls, for heaven sakes Kennedy, too. Yeah, but Lyndon is another kettle of fish. Give him a new vision, Clark. He'll hear you. Rinaldo, leave it there. So, these are the numbers. Now, you will not be held accountable for anything that has happened up till this point, in fact, you will be admired for the noble attempt you have made to honor your predecessor's commitment a commitment that has been exploited by that corrupt and self-destructive regime in South Vietnam. The bombing might have worked, but it hasn't. And to make it work, you would have to resort to unconscionable measures that would make you a her to those in this country you distain and a criminal to those you have sought all your life to assist the young and the poor, who are the ones who will have to fight this war. This, this is not the last inning in the struggle against Communism. We must pick those spots where the stakes are highest for us and where we hold the cards that'll give us the greatest opportunity to prevail. Ho Chi Minh told the French, he said, You will kill ten of my men and I will kill only one of yours, but in the end, it is you who'll tire. And they did, and eleven years ago, at the end they just couldn't do it any more. The North Vietnamese lost 500,000 in their war against the French and they did not tire, and they will not tire now. Not after you commit a 100,000, not after you commit 500,000. And if you do not win decisively after a big buildup, it will be a huge catastrophe. It will destroy the American people's faith in you and the democratic party and their government for years to come. Now, you have always stressed the economic and social dimensions of world problems. And in this you are unrivaled. You have a unique opportunity here to address this problem, economically and socially. Not by war, not by killing people, but by helping them here and there. This is a year of minimum political risk for you, Mr. President. You were elected by the largest landslide in our history, the reactionary elements of this society will not soon recover I foresee little erosion of your prestige and power if we cut our loses and get out of Vietnam. But I foresee nothing but disaster for you and this country if we don't. If we escalate this war, I believe we'll ruin us And I believe we'll ruin you And all the good you've started to do Shit. It's a hot one already. You wish you were back in Texas, Mr. President? Fellahs, right now I'd rather be on the moon. Okay, Bob. Mr. President, Clark has suggested that the stakes aren't there in Vietnam. This is damn shocking. Well, I... Here are the stakes: Number one. National Security. If we back down in Vietnam it will only be a matter of time before we have to go in some place else. Two, the commitment's we've made and the price of breaking them Three, and Our prestige before the world. Could the stakes be any higher? To elaborate on Point 1., if we withdraw, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma will fall, but the ripple effect will be far greater. With Communist agitation increasing in Africa, India, even Japan. We will have to give up some bases. Pakistan will move closer to China. Point two, our pledge is a pillar of peace in the world and if we break it, our allies will lose faith in us. And three, because we have so persistently and publicly committed ourselves to preventing a Communist takeover in South Vietnam, our failure to see that commitment through will be profoundly devastating to our prestige this is why I recommend the following 1, Put the men in. Westmoreland's plan is sound, every quantitative measurement shows we can win. 2, Call up the reserves and extend tours of duty and 3, Expand the bombing. In the North remove restrictions on bridge and rail lines, mine the harbors. Expand Rolling Thunder from twenty-five hundred to four thousand sorties a month. In the South, tactical air strikes must be supplemented by increased B-52 bombing of VC base areas. Now, to elaborate... Clark... Clark, I think you scored some terrific points in there, I'm so glad you were arguing the other side. Well... you believe what you've said to the President, you're certain we can win? Well, I sure hope there's no mistake in my confidence on the President's part. Well, that's not what I'm asking. Clark, I've seen the charts, I've run the numbers, everything else is... soft, speculation. I had dinner with President Kennedy just after the Missile Crisis and he told me that if it had not been for you, keeping your head, facing down the chief, thinking clearly, we might not be alive today. Now, there were no charts and numbers then. Just judgment. You're telling me that it is your judgment that this is the best course of action for this country? For this president? I can only give my best advice. That's what I did for Jack Kennedy, it's what I'm doing now. I'll see you at dinner, Clark. You wanna stop somewhere and talk about it? I'm all talked out, honey. I've done nothing but talk. At some point the talkin's gotta end. God happens when the talkin ends. Lyndon, oh! A hundred PhD's among em, ten thousand IQ points and I can't get an answer I can sit with. And if it turns bad, they'll say this wouldn't ve happened under Jack Kennedy! No, sir! Cause he could do no wrong! He leaves a thousand on the beach in Cuba and his numbers go up! Lyndon, now oh... Lyndon, now c mon, honey. What do you think of crashin through that damn gate and drivin back to Texas? Now you know you'd get no argument from me. You hate it that much? Have you ever considered the shoes I've had to fill? She didn't die with him. Oh, he didn't die. He's more alive than ever cause his half-size brother with one-and-a-half his brains and a tenth his scruples ate his heart out and took in his spirit as sure as he was out of some Injun story. And me, I'll be President What's His Name, who came between the two, the President who lost America's first war. Why must young Americans, born into a land exultant with hope and with golden promises toil and suffer and sometimes die in such a remote and distant place as Vietnam? It is because in the fight for freedom, the American people have learned that retreat does not bring safety, and weakness does not bring peace. If we are driven from the field in Vietnam, then no nation can ever again have the same confidence in American promises, or in American protection. We did not choose to be the guardians of the gate, but there is no one else. Nor would surrender in Vietnam bring peace. Because we learned from Hitler at Munch, that success only feeds the appetite of aggression. I've asked the Commanding General, General Westmoreland, what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression. He has told me and we will meet his needs. I have today ordered to Vietnam the Airmobile Division and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength from 75,000 to 125,000 men almost immediately. Additional forces will be needed later, and they will be sent as requested. Yeah, but how many? Now, I do not find it easy to send the flower of our youth, our finest young men into battle. I think I know how their mothers weep and their families sorrows. Mr. Secretary, Senator Morse has been calling Vietnam, McNamara's War. What is your reaction? This is a war of the United States Government. I am following the President's policy and working in close cooperation with the Secretary of State. Now I must say I don't object to it being called McNamara's War, I think it's a very important war one that I'm pleased to be identified with and to do what I can to win it. Appearing on Meet the Press yesterday McNamara was asked to comment on Hanoi's claim that some 10,000 civilians have been killed in the bombing, including thousands of women and children. Some loss of innocent life is unavoidable in an operation such as this, I can tell you that we are taking every possible precaution in choosing targets, the risk of civilian casualties is most assuredly one of several factors considered. So, what target are you recommending? There's a cement factory along a major rail line. General Wheeler feels military value is marginal. But the monsoon has sucked in more valuable targets. What's the output of the facility? It appears to be small, sir, even by their standards. It couldn't produce enough for them to rely heavily on the output. Let's give it a C for military value, what's your risk analysis? Risk of pilots is close to zero. There might be some small arms fire, but recon shows no antiaircraft emplacements. No megs in the area? They'll be protecting more valuable targets and probably won't risk losing them defending this one. Depending on cloud cover, we may have to come in low enough to be in range of small arms but this is a small risk. Give it an A for risk of pilots and aircraft, what's your flashpoint analysis? The target is more than twenty miles outside Hanoi so there's little risk of provoking China or Russia. Cosigan or Mau won't be down there touring the factory that day, will they? This isn't one of Russia or China's friendship projects? A gift from the motherland? Well, if I were Ho Chi Minh, I would have returned this gift. Of course, catching one of them there might have been a nice bonus for us. Thanks, but I've already been to the brink of nuclear annihilation and I'm not eager to go back. Give it an A for flashpoint risk. Next. What about civilians? We're clear of residential except for one row of hooches behind the facility. So what are these, houses or storage shacks or what? Well, we can't be sure uh, most likely the factory managers and their families live there. I'm not too familiar with Southeast Asian home construction, sir. We could certainly use someone who knows something about Vietnamese culture around here. So, what's the outside number of civilians? Well, four hooches this size, we use six per so, twentyfour. Twenty-four for a target this size, that seems high. That's how we figure it, sir. I mean that seems a high number to lose for a target like this. Give it a D for civilian casualties let's see what we've got, C, A, A, D... let's give it a solid C+ and put it before the President. All right, what's the... Jesus, there's a guy on the wall at the river entrance! Look at that guy. Hey, wait a minute! Stop! Stop! Don't! Don't! Get down from there! Get off! Please, please, the baby, stop! Stop! Yes, Mr. President? You wanted to see me? Yes, sir. You could come down now. Yes, Dick? Mr. President, as uh Bill Moyers told you, I've been offered a fellowship at Wesleyan University in Connecticut Well, good for you. Ha! That ain't easy to get. No, no, I'm very fortunate. Well, don't wait too long to turn it down so they can call the next guy on the list. Mr. President, I have already accepted. No, problem. You didn't know you weren't free to go. Call em up, put me on if they give you any trouble. What do you mean I'm not free to go? I mean you can't go. Can't get along without you. That makes you a pretty big fellah. How big a fellah you gonna be with some fellowship? Well, you've got along without me before I came. You want more money? I got plenty of money. I'll arrange a payment from the Johnson Foundation. Money isn't the issue, Mr. President. This is something that I want to do. Well, it ain't gonna be, so make your call. Mr. President, I uh, I'm very sorry. Well now, Dick... you either stay here with me or you go over to the Pentagon and get yourself a pair of shiny black boots, because there's a statute, I asked McNamara, says we can draft specialists vital to the National Interest and that's what I'll do. You won't to serve here, you know where I can send you. Will you make me a General? No, you won't want to be a General. You'll want to be a Private Marine infantry, that's where the action is, I know you like to be around the action, that's why you stayed here so long. You listen to me, Dick, you go ahead and take your fellowship but your hands are all over this. You and Moyers and Bundy and everybody else talkin about jumpin ship! But most of all, you. You put your name all over the Great Society, you put the tune to those words of war, too and hidin out on some college campus or anything else you ever do is never gonna change that! Dismissed! An entire generation of North Vietnamese have been born and lived and died in the pursuit of one thing a united Vietnam under Communist rule The North Vietnamese have never known anything but war. At CIA we've just completed a study of their staggering recuperative abilities. Bridges, this one was knocked out in a morning raid, two hours later some bamboo planks across a bunch of wooden canal boats and there's foot traffic again. By three p.m. it's a pontoon bridge, strong enough for a fully-loaded truck. A bomb knocks out a rail line, they call the bicycle brigades. some as old as seventy or seventy-five, put the cargo on their bikes, each one balances up to a six hundred pound load across the frame, they wheel it across a jerry-rigged bridge to another train waiting to move it on south. Filling a bomb crater to make a road passable again, that's as routine to a school kid there as getting a malt down at the corner shop here. It's a first date. They have a brand of cigarettes, Mr. President, called Dienbienphu that's their Yorktown, their Waterloo where they defeated the French in 54. Reminders of war are in the most casual moments of daily life. In a smoke, Mr. President, their heroes, he kid who was put to death for trying to assassinate Secretary McNamara last year in Saigon, there's a song about him, It's a top ten hit. And Norman Morrison. Norman Morrison was the Quaker who burned himself to death in front of the Pentagon last month, a great hero. Hanoi just issued a postage stamp. Thank you, John. Thank you, Scott. A great hero? He almost took his one year old daughter with him a baby! It's a miracle she was unharmed. The man was disturbed. Three young children are fatherless. Hero. So, what do we do? Mr. president, the most strategic targets in North Vietnam remain intact because Hanoi and Haiphong continue to be off-limits. We're not hitting their oil supply, major power plants, rail links to China. We're not mining the ports, hitting the dikes... CIA says hittin the dikes would flood the whole damn country! Kill the rice crop! Starve em to death! Isn't that right? Yes, sir. And I have one more problem for your big computer, ask how long it'll take 500,000 angry Americans to climb that White House wall and lynch their President he does somethin like that!? This is why the Chiefs and I have been urging for months that we take the next logical step and destroy their oil reserves. Nothin stopped em yet, why should that stop em!? That oil goes in trucks, Mr. President, trucks that carry troops and guns and bullets across the border to kill our men. They don't need damn trucks! Weren't you watchin !? They got hundred year old women auling crap! What do you want me to do, kill everybody's grandmother in that place!? Mr. President, Ambassador Dobrynin says that Moscow would try to bring Hanoi to the table if we stop the bombing for three or four weeks. This would be a grave mistake, Mr. President. They'll send down everything they can Westy's against it, Admiral Sharp, Bob, I know apposes it and every one of the Chiefs. Look, the North Vietnamese have 9 regiments down there, we thought they had 3. VC has more than doubled theirs from 5 to 12, which is twice our build up. And I just feel that we need to do something before we send another 200,000 men over there. Yes, Bob, we can try bombing them where it hurts. The enemy lost over a thousand in recent fighting, didn't they? They lost 1,200 in the Ia Drang Valley and we lost 300. But it's clear they're willing to take those kinds of casualties, which is something we were not counting on. Some where not counting on. Bob, are you now sayin that no matter what we do militarily there's no sure victory? I believe we may have been overly optimistic about an early end. China, Russia, although they do not want a general war, have stepped up their aid. Just a moment, gentlemen, the President undertook this program because General Westmoreland was confident we could win. Why are we considering / another 200,000 if you now believe victory to be unlikely? That's my question. I still believe we can win. But if there is the slightest chance of obtaining a settlement without sending over hundreds of thousands more men, and hitting their cities, I think we should do it. Right now we are incurring significant casualties, if the buildup continues we may be facing a thousand per month. And if Hanoi won't talk, it will only make our position with the American people stronger and they will be more likely to accept these kinds of loses. We could have a thousand casualties a month if we do this, Mr. President! It's my job to protect our troops, every truck, every sampan that gets through means more dead Americans, they'll send down missiles, anti-air craft guns, it'll set us back a year! All right, wait a minute now, all right... It seems to me that if we're this pessimistic, winning battles, yet predicting stalemates just five months after going in, we should pause the bombing and see what results. I'm sorry, George, but I must disagree. If we pause the bombing and it fails, the President will be under irresistible pressure from the right-wing hawks in Congress to bomb Hanoi, to bomb the Red River dikes. That'll flood the country and create a civilian disaster of such magnitude I do not believe that North Vietnam will talk until they come to the realization that this will be a stalemate that they cannot win Now they're not there. They're unrelenting buildup in the South clearly indicates that they believe they can win. Are you now sayin that we have no choice but to continue to match them man for man? Well, you made that decision, Mr. President, we are there, you have convinced the American people that we should be there. I see no alternative but for you to make your best effort to win. I couldn't believe my ears! Clifford about-facin, McNamara goin soft! They're all changin their tune now. And Ole George McBundy got with the Soviet Ambassador, got a little vodka in him, and those Harvard types that'll believe anything outta diplomat! I don't believe for a minute that Moscow wants peace. You don't have to take his advice if you believe it will fail. Didn't you hear anything! Don't you know if I don't pause the bombing now, the Kennedys'll all shout from the mountaintops that the Russians held out a big fat olive branch and I snapped it in two and now I've missed my chance for peace! So how's academic life? Not nearly as challenging. But I can say I've been getting a lot more sleep. Well, someone has to deal with these things. You certainly have the floor space. That I do. That I do. You know the guy in that portrait? James Forrestal. That's right. Truman's Secretary of Defense. The guy went absolutely nuts. When Truman finally got rid of him, he pinned him with a service medal, he just stood there mute, his throat clamped God knows what demons going through his mind. A couple days later he jumped out of the 16th floor of Bethesda Naval. Sometimes, you can wrestle too much. Bob, we both came in with Jack Kennedy. We were around when this started. Vietnam started with Eisenhower and neither of us were here. I know, and it was Kennedy who put in all those socalled advisors. But, I can't believe that had he lived we'd be in this ditch. You sound like you've been talking to Bobby. He's your friend, what's he telling you? If you told the President to stop the bombing he'd stop it. We have stopped the bombing, under my recommendation. You paused it. Hanoi knows that you're gonna start up again if they don't agree to talk, and they have said a hundred times they won't knuckle under to that. Now, if you told the President that you no longer believe the bombing can work... I never said I believed that. Bobby says you told him it's not worth a damn. Well, that's between Bobby and me. And as far as my influence with the President is concerned, I think you over-estimate my pull. I don't see how that's possible. Peace Talks that's the only way out of this thing now. You stop the bombing for thirty days, the brass is ready to hang me, God, I sure hope Hanoi wants to take the bait because... I just don't think we're going to be able to beat these people. So, are you going public with your views? I'm thinkin about it. Well, you are free to do that now, aren't you? Is that where it happened? Yep. It's incredible. Absolutely incredible. For twenty days now, we and our South Vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs on North Vietnam. We seek neither territory, nor bases, economic domination or military alliance in Vietnam. We fight for the principle of self-determination, for the people of South Vietnam to be able to chose their own course, chose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without fear. We have said all this and we have asked and hoped and we have waited for a response. None has come. I believe that we can continue the Great Society, while we fight in Vietnam, yet there are those who cry out, We must sacrifice. Well, let us rather ask them, Who will they sacrifice? Are they gonna sacrifice the children who seek their learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families that dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home? Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land and the hope of our poor? Vietnam has been fighting for it's independence for 4,000 years. We have defeated the Mongols three times and despite all of his bluster and all his bombs, Emperor Johnson is not nearly as terrifying as Genghis Khan. Ho Chi Minh s statement over Hanoi radio this morning. Thirty-seven days. Thirty-seven days now, not one bomb has fallen, this is our answer. This is our answer. What now, Bob? Hanoi and Haiphong harbor. As you can see, they're in very concentrated areas. The tanks and refineries are within a short distance of residential sections. What about the Russian oil ships? They offload with a 250 foot floating pipeline. That's why we're targeting the distribution tanks, some 1500 feet from the vessels. But still quite close to the residential areas. That's correct. And I understand that they purposely situation strategic targets close to neighborhoods. What about those ships, can they shoot back? No, sir. They're unarmed. But the tanks are protected by surface-to-air missiles. The Russians sent them down during the bombing pause. How many planes will we lose? Twenty to twenty-five. How many casualties? Fifty. And if the bombs miss, it could go as high as 12,000 with 50% of these civilians and 50% of those killed. Of course we don't plan these strikes to miss our targets. But you do miss sometimes. And this time you could hit a Russian ship and the bomber pilot, he'll be a kid from Johnson City, Texas. That'll be the kid that starts World War III, thank you very much. All right, so what great things will result from this plan? With no oil, their entire infiltration effort will grind to a halt, from manufacturing to transportation. Their war making capability will be destroyed and they will have to negotiate. Dean? The Chinese and the Soviets will step up aid. And we could lose the support of Canada, Japan and the Chinese representation issue at the UN. If a Russian ship is sunk, we just don't know. The Chinese may send in troops, but as Bus said, this could end it. What if it doesn't? What if by God's grace we don't have a million Chinese and nuclear war, but they still won't quit? What will you be askin me to hit next? Strategic targets closer to the center of Hanoi. The Paul Doumer Bridge, four major rail lines cross it. The power plant, industry, all within five miles of downtown. Bob, are you for this? It might work. So you're for it. Uh, Mr. President? Walt? Since taking over for Mac Bundy, I've had a chance to evaluate our bombing policy and I uh, well, I believe that our continued delay in attacking Hanoi is causing Russia and China to underestimate our resolve and that that may actually encourage World War III. Clark? As always, I support any measure that has a chance of ending this. Anyone else? George? Nothin to add? This will not affect North Vietnamese manpower, which has proved to be limitless. It will be hard for the Russians and the Chinese to take, I'm concerned as always about the escalating level of violence, but maybe this will finally satisfy the hawks in Congress. If we have to do it, let's do it now. You know, George, you remind me of a country schoolteacher, asked if he believes the world is flat or round, he says, I can teach it either way. How soon do we go? This is the same as mine, you know. I just as soon forget about those thirteen days. He had them made at Tiffany's didn't he? He gave one to Jackie, too. She joked it's the only thing he ever gave her from there that wasn't ordered straight out of their catalog. A trying time. You speak as if it's in the past. What? The trying time. Here you go. ...Johnson wasn't much of a poker player but he loved the political conversation. Can a whiskey convert a man, Clark? Look at them. You know what they remind me of? A flock of buzzards sittin on a fence discussing the price of carrion. Buzzards. George. You could have had Bundy's job. What was it, Clark? You haven't socked away enough dough yet? Oh, no, that's unbecoming of you, George. The basement office? What? You know I'd lose my freedom to advice him on his Presidency if I took a cabinet post. George, the President wants to get out of Vietnam just as much as you do, in principle. Principle? There's a word that's been tossed about more than a dollar whore in a port of call. How's this for principle: what a waste. You know who said that? No. McNamara. To me. For all the principle around here we're in one hell of a mess, don't you think? Look at him. His wife's got an ulcer, his kid's got an ulcer, everybody's got Bob McNamara's ulcer but Bob McNamara. Sometimes I think it's all just a god damn academic exercise to him. George. You mustn't give up on this, George. Oh, Christ, Clark. Marny. Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Clifford how are you. I'd like you to meet Charles Rob. Clark Clifford. Anyone who still thinks we ought to be in Vietnam should take a detour from work and drive by Arlington Cemetery every day for a week. I don't think I'd trust anyone in a policymaking position who'd do that. Who did what, Bob? Who faced the consequences of his counsel? Who needed a reminder of what war was all about? A reminder of what? Our jobs in World War II, in the rear? I pushed paper just like you, Walt. We were all too damn smart. I must've been sittin on my brains then up in that B-25. Two years in prison camps. That's right, Nick's the only one here who saw combat. And you were probably pickin his targets, Walt. As I remember, we won that war. Yeah, well, you can tell that to the 50,000 dead men, women and children of Dresden. Dresden... Is anyone ready for dinner? Dresden was bombed for the rail lines. Dresden was bombed to terrorize the hell out of those people, which is precisely what our B-52s are doing in Vietnam. And if this keeps up, in another year, we'll have dropped more there than on all of Europe. Isn't that right, Bob? Let's go inside, darling. Isn't that what you told me the other day? In private? Among some other things. Such as the fact that we've destroyed so much of that country they can't even grow enough rice to feed themselves, the rice bowl of the world. George. We've created so many refugees that if we had the same proportion out of their homes in this country, there d be thirty-million people on the streets. Isn't that right? Bob? Isn't that what you said? What was it Tacitus said about the Romans at Carthage? You have made a desert and call it peace. If you still can't reach him then get whosever on call, we need a doctor here. Christ, Marny. I'll be all right. It was the liqueur Hello? Mr. Secretary, it's Major Wolfson at the Command Center. We just got a call from CINCPAC saying the weather around Hanoi has cleared and the fighter-bombers are on their way. Bob, it's me. Mr. President, the operations we discussed will be going tonight. They have perfect conditions. Bob, Bob these, these, these pilots are said to be the cream. They're the best the Navy and Air Force have, Mr. President, and they know you're counting on them All right, Bob. Thank you. I'm going to the Pentagon now, I'll call as soon as I have word, Mr. President. Thank you. Forgive me for ventilating so freely. I believe that you are only so worried because you feel foolish having waited so long to take this action. If, if you did it a year ago, instead of using kid gloves and giving them an extra month in which to resupply, it would have followed quite naturally but now it seems to you like one step too many. The problem is, my good sir, each step has been inches instead of yards. We have been going to war by inches! Tip-toeing apologetically when we should be striding through with our heads held high like Americans! Why aren't we hearin from em!? Yes, Bob. Mr. President, they had some weather. You said it was clear! I'll call you the moment I know anything. Bob, my life's in your hands here. Yes, sir. Our Father... Our Father... Our Father... Who art in heaven, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name... Hallowed be thy name... Well, if you admit her you could run some tests on her, can't you, goddamnit, I mean... Secretary, Exec-con on one. You can see there that she's in a hell of a lot of pain. Thy kingdom come. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. On earth. On earth. On earth. As it is in heaven. As it is in heaven. Give us this day... Give us this day... Our daily bread... Our daily bread... And forgive us our trespasses. And forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us. As we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation. Lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Deliver us from evil. Amen. Amen. Go ahead. Mr. President, I just talked with Honolulu, all the primaries were hit, and no ships were struck. Now, we did lose two aircraft due to anti-air. No Russian ships? We didn't hit any Russian ships? No, but as I say, uh, two pilots are down. I won't know about civilian casualties till we have the photos. Now, if the weather holds we could send the RFs in to see just what collateral damage... All right, Bob. Thank you. Thank you. Pentagon sources tell CBS news that General Westmoreland has been granted even great authority over the use of B-52s in Vietcong controlled areas in the South. With the recent escalation of bombing over North Vietnam, aimed to destroying the heart of the enemies urban industrial capacity, the US clearly wants to force a change in Hanoi's will to continue the war. Last year the rate of Rolling Thunder missions reached 1,500 per week, since then the rate of sorties has doubled. Mr. President it appears that the air strikes have had no effect on the enemy's war making capability. The attacks were not successful? Well, why we did destroy nearly 100% of their oil storage capacity in our follow-up attacks throughout the summer, a large portion of their stock was put into barrels and dispersed in anticipation of our strikes. They've retained enough to meet ongoing requirements. Their buildup is continuing. And Westmoreland is requesting additional men. How many? The Program Three forces will bring us up to 431,000 by the middle of 67. What about the bombin ? We're looking at heavier B-52 strikes in the southern DMZ, and in North Vietnam--targets in the restricted zones. Downtown Hanoi. Yes, sir. And Haiphong. And in the buffer zone with China. The good news, Mr. President, is that the naysayers were wrong. Peking and Moscow stood still and they will very likely stand still even with intensified activity. Are you recommendin some of these new targets for me today? Yes, I am. You have the evaluation sheets before you. I have some photographs here, number seventy-two of the Van Dien truck depot. That the one with the school up the street? As a matter of fact, yes, the Polish Friendship School across the highway a half a mile up. Mr. President, as you may recall, in order to avoid a tax increase we did not budget for the war beyond this fiscal year which has cost us 20 billion as apposed to the 12 billion projected. We're over by eight billion? Eight billion? Mr. President, if you approve these new forces, constraints on domestic programs will no longer be avoidable. It's all in a memo I sent over to you today along with some recommendations. Joe, I want to start workin on the State of the Union. You sit down with Bob and Walt and Fowler. Yes, Mr. President. There's to be no mention of the Great Society! What is it you're lookin for!? Undersecretary of State? I'll change the title to the Holy Roman Emperor, right? No, this is the best way I can serve your Presidency and I think Dean Rusk would feel undercut if you were to fill George Ball's job with a personal friend of yours. I don't give a rat's ass what Rusk feels, I need you in that room, Clark. I need someone like George with an ability to reason and argue. A devil's advocate. George Ball is not playing devil's advocate. He believed every word he said. All right. All right. Moyers wants the job. My press man thinks if I make him number two at State I'll all of a sudden give a shit what he thinks about Vietnam. And McNamara, McNamara sends me a paper, says we should cap the troops, level off the bombin. You know what happens if I stop bombin ? Ho Chi Minh runs five more divisions up my ass, that's what happens! It was McNamara's program, the whole thing, now he's talkin up a shit storm to Bobby! Oh, you don't know that. I know everything. I know who's sayin what at those fancy Georgetown dinner parties. I know cause I had Hoover put a couple of boys there, too. I know. What they say doesn't matter. You're not helpless in this situation. You're approval ratings are down. You need to go out there on the stump and sell the truth Westmoreland is now aying that a Communist military victory is impossible. You're finally winning in Vietnam. We're winnin but we're losin . We're killin em and we're losin . We're losin because this war goes on and on and on. I passed twice the number of bills FDR got through in his first hundred days There's never been an era in American history like this, yet there's so much left to do. But this war has got to end! Five years pussyfootin about in that miserable little country. Two billion dollars a month! We could be feedin these people, educatin these people! Goddamnit why won't that sonovabitch let me help him? Why!? Why won't he lay down his arms and stop killing off his sons in the flower of their youth? I do not understand. I... I just do not understand. Mr. President... Moyers, get me Moyers, and get me General Westmoreland on the other line. Can I help you, Mr. President? Get your bags packed. Call the press together. We're goin to Vietnam. Dean? Are they ours? I fuckin hope so. Attention. Arms! Order, down! Where you from, Son? Louisville, Kentucky, sir. Kentucky? Yes, sir. Have you turn majority age yet, Corporal? I was twenty-one last month, sir. My mom and my girl sent me a big ol chocolate cake and it came just in time, sir. Good. Bill, get em out. Yes, Mr. President. Come on, guys. Well, they've given me the honor, Corporal McCaffrey, of pinnin you with this purple heart here. There. You'll be home right soon, and on the first Tuesday of November, you got a congressional election I want you to vote. Yes, sir. Yeah, you'll be able to get to your pollin place? I don't know where it is, but I'll get a ride, sir. All right. Make sure you vote now. Yes, sir. We're all behind you, sir. Every one of us. We won't let you down. All right, son. Thank you. And I won't let you down! You'll get everything you need. I thank you, I salute you, may the good Lord look over you and keep you safe until you come home and nail that coonskin to the wall. Three cheers for the President! Hip-hip-hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Certainly the bombing of the North makes the war more costly and more difficult and more painful for North Vietnam. It is a harsh punishment indeed. But we are not in Vietnam to play the part of an avenging angel pouring death and destruction. We are there to assure the selfdetermination... Kennedy, McCarthy they haven't done a thing for this country! Not a fuckin thing! And look at all I've done. It should be clear by now hat the bombing of the North cannot bring an end to the war in the South, and that indeed at the present time it may well be prolonging that war. Our troops are being killed by the bullets and the mines of the South. If, by ending the bombing of the North we can bring peace to South Vietnam, we will save the lives of thousands of... I don't know why you're worried about Kennedy and your second term, because I don't think your health will survive your first term. Where you going ? I want to be useful to you. And I would listen even as you rant and rave, but I have worked far too hard and born far too much to watch you destroy yourself. ...major political elements of South Vietnam, anticipate... The bridge is a major target and we've never hit it. The chance of civilian deaths will be almost zero. I say one hundred to five hundred, possibly more. Which is it? Five hundred or zero? Mr. President, the Stennis Committee is up in arms over our holding back on these targets. Bob's testimony is coming up and it might take some heat off him if some of these can be cleared up before his appearance. I can take the heat without padding my resume with more bombing missions. This is a heavily defended target in a very populated area. The photos are right here, Mr. President. The photos are meaningless, the target is heavily defended. The pilots jettison their bombs when they re under attack. Now, I've been asking for two years why they don't come straight up he river that way they dump the bombs, they go in the water and not on the people and I still haven't got an answer! Coming in from the Gulf involves an extra turn, with our backs to those heavy defenses. If it is so well defended, should we risk the pilots? Men dying is a relative thing. The effect of the air campaign is cumulative. Every blow makes the enemy stretch his resources. Stretching is a relative thing. Mr. President, we shouldn't be bombing for punitive reasons, but there just doesn't seem any point to this anymore! Hit it. Hit the goddamn bridge. What's next. Uh, number 309, sir, the uh railcar repair shop... Marg? Marg!? Oh, Jesus! Come to me. Come on. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I don't know what I'm gonna do, Marg. Rostow, The Chiefs, they're gonna drive this thing straight to hell. I won't be long. Okay. One-two-three-four, we don't want your fucking war! One-two-three-four, we don't want your fucking war! One-two-three-four, we don't want your fucking war! One-two-three-four, we don't want your fucking war! One-two-three-four, we don't want your fucking war! One-two-three-four, we don't want your fucking war! One-two-three-four Hey-hey-LBJ How many kids you kill today? Hey-hey-LBJ How many kids you kill today? Hey-hey-LBJ How many kids you kill today? Hey-hey-LBJ How many kids you kill today? All right, take formation, spread out Stop the war in Vietnam, bring those troops back home! Stop the war in Vietnam, bring those troops back home! Let's go! Let's go! File in, move it up! Hell-no, we won't go! Hell-no, we won't go! Hell-no, we won't go! Hell-no, we won't go! No rifle is to be loaded without my permission. I'll have the commanders go down the line again. Not one bullet, damn it! Get off me! Let me go! Get off me! Let me go! Just let me go! Look, look at that. There he is! That's McNamara! Over there! Secretary McNamara, on behalf of the subcommittee, let me thank you for your appearance here today. I have, from the beginning, and do today, fully support the objectives of the bombing to interdict men, and supplies and hinder the enemy's ability to wage war in the South. In this I am 100% behind the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Sharp, General Westmoreland, and his commanders, as they are fully aware, and as the President is aware. We are all greatly encouraged to hear that, Mr. Secretary. You are the last to testify, as you know, and the overwhelming view from General Wheeler and the others is that there has been excessive interference from your office-- If I'd be permitted to finish my statement, Senator Stennis, there are copies available outside the hearing room. Our greater objective, however, was, and remains, to persuade the leaders of North Vietnam that they cannot prevail. In this we have been unsuccessful. This is due to the fact that North Vietnam can sustain its forces in the South with a mere 100 tons of supplies a day, through corrupt elements in the South Vietnamese government. Out of 359 targets recommended by the Chiefs, only 57 remain unstruck. Two are battery plants manufacturing a total of 600 tons a year, not enough to fill the corner of a Sears, Roebuck regional warehouse. Just a moment, Mr. Secretary! There's a rubber plant producing The service station where I fill my car could supply the output of this facility. Excuse my interruption. Hitting these targets will cost us in pilots, planes, and hard cash, and they will kill more and more civilians. The military knows this. They think it's worth it. I do not. Hold on! You know what he did to me out there? It's like sellin your house and your son takes the buyer aside and tells him there's leaks in the basement. Now Hanoi knows we're divided and they'll never stop. I've gotta get rid of that sonovabitch. You can't just get rid of him. The Republicans will play up the disunity and Bobby'll have a field day. Bobby's clamorin for him to resign don't you know, to go public against me for doin what he advised! Look, we'll find a job for McNamara where he won't be able to snipe at you. I'll help you fill his post with someone you can trust. I'll do anything I can for you, Mr. President. But we have a reelection campaign to start and we do not have a policy to end this war. Clark, you'll do anything you can? They're ready for you, Mr. President. Yep. I'll be out in a minute. Sit down, Bob. I'm sorry you found out from the Washington Post. I'm sure Fowler told you, or the bank people. Nobody told me anything, Mr. President. I uh, mentioned to you in the spring that I'd been approached by the World Bank, but I thought if you were going to nominate me, you would have said something yourself. They're doin fine work there--humanitarian work. I know that's of interest to you. Yes, but only if it's what you want. If I can no longer be of service... Service? Who's been of more service to me than you? Why you've served longer than any Defense Secretary in history. Look what you've had to shepherd us through. The Cuban crisis, two Cuban crisis, Berlin, Dominican, Middle East. Hell, that's a tough enough job in peace time. And look what you've had to deal with Mr. President, my point is, I don't have to leave until you want me to leave. Bob, Joe Fowler asked me for three nominees. I said I only got one McNamara. There were tears in the Treasury Secretary's eyes cause he was hopin he'd be my choice. And with tears in his eyes he said he had to submit three names to the bank. I said, okay, it's McNamara, McNamara, and McNamara. You ask him. Now, the bank directors vote today, but it's uh, it's just a formality. Now, Bob, I better get over to Lady Bird's beautification awards, important to her. Your wife's the same with her readin program, I know. Yes, although with her condition it's been difficult. Ah, no improvements since surgery? My son, uh... he has em as well. You deserve whatever you want from this government. My obligation is to help you, and this was within my power to grant you. People have an obligation to the President, not the other way around. May your selfless service, spent in defendin freedom bring even greater rewards in the larger work that you now undertake to promote freedom throughout the world. Signed, Lyndon B. Johnson, President. This is the Medal of Freedom, the highest award a President can bestow upon a citizen of the United States. I award it now to a loyal, brilliant, good man, Robert McNamara the very best we have. Thank you, Mr. President, this is an almost impossible situation to respond to. You're used to impossible situations. Now, I stand here tonight to tell you that I regard Bob McNamara here, as not only one of the smartest, but one of the most humane men I know. One, put the men in. Two, call up the reserves, extend tours of duty. And three, expand the bombing. Mr. President, uh, I cannot uh... find the words to express what lies in my heart today and uh... I think I better respond at another time. Mr. Clifford Mr. Clifford, does your acceptance of the job of Defense Secretary signal your interest in elected office? It signals only my desire to serve a great President and a long-time friend. I am 61 years old and I am sure this will finish me off. Quiet please! Quiet please! Joe, Joe? It's been observed that in your views on Vietnam, you've changed from dove to hawk, which are you? I am not conscious of falling under any of those ornithological divisions. I'll tell you this, he's no ostrich. I know of no man who will call it as it is with such candor and judgment as this man, Clark Clifford. We got a light at the end of the tunnel now! It's probably a small attack, Mr. President the embassy compound's been hit before. Mr. Secretary, it's not just the embassy, the palace, legislature, airport, too Secretary Rusk! Put it on the speaker phone. Go ahead, Ben. Dean, I've got the duty officer at the Embassy, Alan Brandt. Mr. Brandt! Mr. Brandt can you hear me? They're shooting right outside, Mr. Secretary. Outside of the Embassy compound? Inside! They blew through the wall, they're at the doors. Rostow, Casualty report. Do you have something to defend yourself with, Mr. Brandt? I'm at the window! They're below me. They see me. They're looking right at me. I've got to go, Mr. Secretary. I've got to go I've got to get out Small attack!? These are desperation moves, Mr. President we've got them on the run! It's not just Saigon. The Vietcong have launched surprise attacks on 36 of the provincial capitals of South Vietnam. From the streets of Wai near the DMZ, to the US Embassy compound in Saigon, the casualty count on both sides has been unprecedented. The U.S. Military says it is successfully beating back the Vietcong attacks, but clearly they are paying an enormous price. The enemy's well-laid plans went afoul! They tried to ignite a revolution in the South, and they failed. If this is a failure, God help us when they have a success. I've given em all the men, the planes, the guns, the bullets he said he needed, I thought we were winnin this thing! Now Westmoreland says he wants 206,000 more troops! We'll have 750,000 there. Three quarters of a million men in Vietnam. Light at the end of the tunnel! Hell, we don't even have a tunnel! We don't even know where the tunnel is! I want you to get Westmoreland here, get your people together and look at this thing. We'll give em the boys if we have to, but on your recommendation. You'll wait? I'll wait, but not for long. If he needs em what the hell am I supposed to do!? Old friend... get me an answer. Give us these troops and we can seize the initiative! But it will just be more of the same! The enemy's taken 200,000 killed and he'll take 200,000 more! We've lost a tenth that many and Americans are rioting in the streets. They should be cheering! They Vietcong lost. We were victorious. That's true, Walt, but remember they only committed to this offensive--holding enough back to strike again. That's right, damn it and it could happen at any time. I say put the men in. There are no more trained men. We would ship raw troops and train them in the rear. What rear? There is no rear in Vietnam anymore. I would hope we've at least learned that from this victory. With 206,000 more men we could go into Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam and cut out their supply routes once and for all we have never been given that authority! Excuse me, General. Dean, you said the enemy committed 175,000 men to the offensive. That's right, Clark. And General Westmoreland says that they suffered to wounded ratio. It's right here in my report. We beat the pants off them! Then how in the hell can we justify to the public sending hundreds of thousands more men!? We tell them this: that we're within inches of victory inches! Yes, sir. And 3.5 times that number are out of action? It's in the report, Clark. If there's 45,000 dead and three and a half times that number... General, according to you and General Westmoreland we have killed and wounded 120% of the enemy. It's becoming more and more evident that an out and out military victory cannot be achieved with any strategy. So... these are my recommendations: one, send Westmoreland only those forces that will satisfy his immediate need. Wheeler has agreed to 22,000 plus the units previously approved and already scheduled for deployment. This would stave off immediate defeat while we move to negotiations. We realize that the settlemen will not be favorable for Saigon and they would fight it. Two, the bombing, Wheeler, the other Chiefs and Walt Rostow all advocate hitting the remaining targets in Hanoi and Haiphong and mining and bombing the harbors. With the support of everyone else, I recommend a bombing halt. I've told you, I'm not gonna stop the bombin . It keeps the lead out of our boys. There's little evidence to support that, sir and the bombing is going to be the single greatest issue in the Presidential campaign. The perception is evolving out there that Eugene McCarthy is the peace candidate and you are the war candidate. If McCarthy has a good showing in New Hampshire, I think Bobby'll throw his hat in. But he can't beat you if you're sitting at the peace table. Peace table! Sell out South Vietnam. This is your advice!? If I could lay a plan to win the war before... I gotta go on TV in three weeks and explain all this to the American people! Huh? And you're tellin me to cut and run admit defeat that for nothin ! That 20,000 American mothers weep for nothin ! The situation has changed since Tet. Yes, it has! Tet was a failure! The enemy has failed to overrun us and we are poised to win and now it's only you and your people who are advising against the extra effort it'll take to turn three years of miserable war into victory! And I'm telling you there is no victory to be had! Not without measures that'll tear this country apart and bring down this administration! I told you to get out of Vietnam three years ago Lyndon when you... What about two years ago, and one! Hey? You shot down every bombing pause, backed every troop increase! Don't you dare! Mr. President, my counsel has not deviated one whit! My every word, then as now has been informed solely by my commitment to preserve your Presidency and establish your place in this country's history! I shoulda cleaned house November 63, got rid of all of em, McNamara, Bundy, Connally, wooin me those fuckin Kennedy lovers would be disloyal to me! All of em! They only advised you, Mr. President. You decided. Against all your natural instincts against the whole of your life experience... you decided. Senator Eugene McCarthy, dove of Vietnam, who was virtually unknown to voters of this state two months ago, has finished in a virtual tie with the sitting President of the United States, Lyndon Johnson. Since poles taken only a week ago, predicted Johnson would win two-thirds of the vote and McCarthy only eleven percent, the Senator's surprisingly high turn-out has shocked the country. I run because it is now unmistakably clear that we can change these disastrous, divisive policies only by changing the men who are now making them. I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done and I feel that I am obliged to do all that I can. Oh, I was there, I was there when you told your brother to go into that place. I was there. And now I'm payin for it day after day after day while you cut me to pieces! There's blood on your hands, you traitor! ...prolong that war. Our troops are being killed by the bullets and the mines of the South. If by ending the bombing of the North we can bring peace to South Vietnam, then we will save the lives of thousands of our young men, and thousands of Vietnamese. Yes, Mr. President? I talked to Mills. He won't back a war surtax unless we go on TV and announce deep cuts. I want you to go up there and talk to everybody at Ways and Means. I'm meeting with five of them in the morning, sir. Take Ackley up with ya, to back up the numbers, cause they wont believe anything outta the White House anymore. That's a good idea. Anything else, Mr. President? I.... Are you all right, Mr. President? Yeah, Joe, I'm all right. Joe...Senator Kennedy's speech who wrote it for him? This guy Walinsky on his staff's been writing a lot of his stuff. I don't know, maybe Schlesinger, Sorensen. Goodwin? I think he was involved... yes. All right, Joe. Thanks. Sir. I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today my own government. Hey-hey-LBJ, how many kids you kill today? Hey-hey-LBJ, how many kids you kill today? Hey-hey-LBJ, how many kids you kill today? The largest antiwar demonstration yet brought hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets of American cities. The radicals say that since peaceful demonstrations won't end the war, they're ready to move from protest to resistance. With talk of full-scale rebellion is sweeping the country from college campus's to the inner cities the mood is turning ugly and there's a dangerous sense that the Nation's political is spinning out of control. For it seems now more certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate. This summer's almost certain stand-off will either end in real give and take negotiations or terrible escalation. But it is increasingly clear to this reporter, that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate not as victors but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy and did the best they could. This is Walter Cronkite, goodnight. Well, say what you think. All right. It's tough. And effective. But the music in it is sad and sour to the ear. And I don't know that any speechwriter could have made it sing. I got a hundred bills in committee and they'll never see the light of day. But I think I could pass a thousand bills more education, more health care, more rights but it wouldn't matter cause it seems nothin I say, no matter how I say it could ever bring this country together again. Then perhaps eloquence of speech is no longer the answer... but eloquence of action. Mr. Secretary... Would you be kind enough to make sure that the President sees that this evening? Clark? Lady Bird I promised to have these budget figures by the end of the day. Oh, he's right inside. No, no, I won't disturb him. Thank you, goodnight. Clark? Uh, Clark. I've got the speech here. I need your help with it. You know that I'm at your service, Mr. President. I know, old friend. Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight, I want to speak to you of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. We are prepared to move immediately towards peace through negotiations. We are reducing, substantially reducing the present level of hostilities and we are doing so unilaterally, and at once. Tonight, I have ordered our aircraft and our naval vessels to make no more attacks on North Vietnam except in the area north of the demilitarized zone where the continuing enemy buildup directly threatens allied forward positions. The area in which we are stopping our attacks includes almost 90% of North Vietnam's population and most of its territory. Our purpose in this action is to bring about a reduction in the level of violence that now exists. It is to save the lives of brave men and to save the lives of innocent women and children. Now, as in the past, the United States is ready to send its representatives, in any forum, any time to discuss the means of bringing this ugly war to an end. There is a division in the American house now. There is divisiveness among us all tonight. With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home... with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance everyday, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office the Presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President. But let men everywhere know, however, that a strong, and a confident, and a vigilant America stands ready tonight to seek an honorable peace and stands ready tonight to defend an honored cause, whatever the price, whatever the burden, whatever the sacrifice that that duty may require. Thank you for listening. Good night and God bless you all. President Johnson's speech and the bombing cutback, led to the first peace talks between the U.S. and North Vietnam. Negotiations derailed under President Nixon, but a settlement was eventually signed after four more years of war, at the end of which more than 58,000 Americans and two million Vietnamese were dead. President Johnson died on January 22, 1973, five days before the Paris Peace Accords were signed. Many of the programs and initiatives of the Great Society endure.
