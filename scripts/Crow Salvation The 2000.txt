The impending state execution of Alex Corvis may provide the Randalls, and what seems the majority of this crowd, with some form ofjustice. - Why are there so many? -Just hold on to me. Back, back. Mr. Randall, sir, do you think this execution... will bring you a sense of closure for you and your daughter? Erin, your sister has been gone for three years now. Can you tell us anything? [ Shouting ] A difficult time for everyone involved. lnteresting fact: lt will take about 21 cents of electricity... to execute Alex Corvis tonight, on this, his 2 1 st birthday. [ Cell Door Opens ] [ Sighs ] He didn't order that. We found the man with the scar. Go ahead, make a wish. Get it out of here. [ Cell Door Closes ] Oh, yes, l've come to a lot of these over the years, but this one has, well, many unique aspects. The youth of the condemned. Now, that's unusual. And 53 stab wounds! Hmph! Kind of a record. - And Corvis still maintaining his innocence? - Oh, they all say that. l saw those two fighting that day. Facing the chair, you do what you gotta do. [ Sniffs ] You okay? What's been holding me together... is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. l'll be seein' her again soon, you know. Only what can l say? That l was too stupid to find the guy that killed her? That he's down here laughin' Tell her... we'll get him. [ Scoffs ] " We" won't . Someday he'll surface, and l'll get him for both of you. l promise. l'll find the guy with the scar. This mystery man with the scar, the zigzag, whatever? We couldn't find him. Obviously the jury didn't buy it. - [ Reporter ] Some people here seem to. - Look. People here are protesting execution of a kid turned 21 . A kid who had a tough life. No parents, no dough, always had to fight for everything. lt's a tragedy. lt really is. lf l was facing the hot seat, l'd want my attorney... banging down the door to the Supreme Court, not playing some board game. But maybe that's just me. Your move. No. lt's time. l don't want you to watch. l don't want to give 'em the pleasure. Come on now. [ lnmates Banging Rhythmically ] [ Banging Louder] [ Minister ] " The Lord is my shepherd, l shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though l walk through the valley of the shadow of death... l will fear no evil... for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me... in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy... shall follow me... all the days of my life... and l will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Alexander Frederick Corvis, do you have any last words? l loved Lauren. l still do. l'm innocent. [ Scoffs ] [ Panting ] Murderer! Look at that. Goddamn helmet melted his skin off. That's what l call a deterrent. Oops. Why do they bother autopsying these guys? l mean, the cause of death is pretty fucking obvious. [ Chattering ] Go on to the car, honey. Go on. Mr. Randall, we all wish this would have ended better, sir. [ Thunderclaps ] [ Sounds Of Squawking ] [ Gasping ] [ Crow Squawks ] [ Squawks ] [ Squawking ] [ Squawks ] [ Squawks ] [ Squawks ] [ Squawks ] [ Beeping ] We've got unauthorized movement on B-5. [ Crow Squawking ] l repeat. Unauthorized movement, B-4, B-2, all of section " B" and section " C." [ Beeping ] We have an escape in progress. l repeat, an escape in progress. - Mercer, are you down there? - This is Mercer. l'm on it. They're heading for the roof. [ Squawking ] [ Rock, lndistinct ] [ Squawks ] [ Guard Over Radio ] All prisoners present and accounted for. Then who's fucking Houdini? [ Squawking ] [ Squawks ] [ Squawks ] - What? Police? Evidence? - [ Squawks ] [ Squawking ] - [ Chuckling ] - [ Squawking ] [ Squawks ] There's nothing under " Crow." [ Squawks ] " Execution" ? [ Squawks ] - Lauren! - [ Squawks ] What are you trying to say here? l'm all yours. [ Squawking ] His knife! - Corvis. - [ Alex ] You lie! You lie! Thomas Leonard. [ Footsteps ] [ Squawking ] Shit. [ Squawking ] l thought l'd be with you now. l'm not dead. And l'm not alive. And l'm remembering. And it hurts. Your Shaolin style is no match for my kung fu. Your flying crane style... [ Laughing ] is no match for my drunken tiger kick. Aww. Your mad monkey love... is no match-- l can't be alive. Not without you. l want to be with you forever. - l want to be with you forever. - Only forever? [ Gasps ] lt's okay. l'm not gonna hurt you. Don't come near me! - l was a friend of your sister's . - l know her friends. That locket you're holding. - You have one just like it. - No kidding. Your father gave them to both of you. He's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face? - Someone else did it. - You're a friend of the guy who killed Lauren, aren't you? - You almost sound like him. - He didn't kill her. - How do you know? - l know everything about your sister. l'll prove it to you. Stay away from me! Dad! Dad! - Dad. - Are you all right? There's this guy. He said he was a friend of Lauren's . He had paint all over his face. [ Erin ] He was here! He was right here! [ Rock, lndistinct ] [ Door Opens ] [ Continues lndistinct ] Marcy! She's resting, Thomas. Where the fuck did you come from? Big bang, primordial ooze? Divine hand of a benevolent creator? All possibilities. Although, recent events have given me doubts... about the benevolent creator. - You lied at my trial, Thomas. - l don't even know you, man. Capital case 99-C1 1 5. Alex Corvis! [ Screams ] Exhibit " A." Hey, l said what l saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl. No, you said you saw me with this. l never held it until today. What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker! One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car. There's no scar. Corvis made it up. Wrong answer! They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all l had to do was stand up there and nod my head " yes." What did they give you? Ajob! Construction. Twelve an hour. [ Coughing ] Write their names down. You've already got 'em all right here. These cops said they needed an eyewitness or Corvis would walk. [ Laughs ] [ Siren Wails ] [ Rock, lndistinct ] Oh. [ Knocking ] ls there a problem? Let's hope not. - License and registration, please. - Yeah. What's with your friend there? She's sick. - Actually, she never had Mai Tais before. - But you've had 'em. Oh, not tonight. Honest. lf you had a license, l bet l'd have seen it by now. How old are you? What? Fifteen? Look, l'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back. She has a license, but-- l mean, look at her. Jannie, get up. Come on, get up! Get up! [ Continues lndistinct ] Why don't you get out? Want me to walk a straight line? - l want you to bend over. - Can l just call a cab? What'd l say? Very nice. Maybe l'll just ask your friend here. l want you to bend over, Officer Dutton. What the fuck did you-- Get out of the car. Now! Hey, punk! - Get your hands on the car. - These hands? You're dead, ditch weed. Oh, my God! [ Screams ] - [ Screams ] - You're up! [ Groaning ] Ladies, drive carefully. You might want to call 9-1 -1 . Report an officer down. That was a fucking hollow point! Guess it's true. Guns don't kill people. Think, uh, like maybe knives do? Keep that thing away from me. Phillip, this is not just some " thing." lt's " AC-005." You're the skell that broke into the evidence room. Fuck! What do you want? A scar on the arm... of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car. There was no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up. He was innocent. You killed him! You and Erlich and Roberts and Toomey. What do you think, Officer Dutton, huh? An eye for an eye? [ Screams ] No! No! [ Men Shouting ] - [ Gunshot ] - Get her! [ Screaming ] You were there? All four of you? You killed her! l saw it! Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the foot. lf she had just shut up and acted like a girl, nothing would have happened. So you're right, spooky. You happy? [ Gunshot ] l'm working on it. [ Gunshot ] [ Rock, lndistinct ] [ Continues lndistinct ] [ Chattering ] - Police! - Fuck! What the fuck? Don't do that, man. That's fuckin' really cool. Thank you. So, how'd the month end up? - Fantastic. - Yeah. - Never been better. Where's Dutton? Probably parked in front of some high school with a hard-on. The fuck never showed up. [ Laughing ] - You know why Dutton's not here? - No. Rigor mortis. Dead! One shot to the head. Then 53 stab wounds with a six-inch blade. This cause any kind of deja vu for you guys? [ Siren Wailing ] Rumors multiply as police refuse to confirm or deny reports of multiple, multiple stab wounds. - Dad, come in here. - Yeah, what is it, honey? - That cop who found the knife in Corvis's car. - [ TV] They're moving him now. Body covered. lt would appear that 37-year-old Phillip Dutton is dead in the line of duty. Let's go. [ Police Officer ] Watch her. What are you doing? Get back behind the line. Get back there right now. lt's shocking, even for these mean streets. The word " Daisy" carved into his forehead by the perpetrator still at large. A name? Perhaps a message. What's the matter, honey? Lauren used to call me that when we were little. Daisy. Nobody knew but us. Honey, it doesn't mean anything. lt's not a message. No, that guy at the cemetery said he knew everything about Lauren. lt still doesn't mean anything. He said he'd prove it. [ Squawks ] Come on, you're hiding something! l don't know anything about any knife. - l'm tryin' to forget that case. - Well, someone isn't . They killed Dutton. - lt wasn't me. - No shit. You couldn't get close to him. But l am betting... that you know who did. You're the only one who gave a flying fuck about him when he was alive. - Lauren Randall did. - Yeah, well, bitches are crazy. The richer they are, the crazier they get. Yeah? Maybe if you hadn't fried an innocent kid-- Who is it? Who is it? Maybe it's the real killer. Did you ever think of that? Huh? lf you're covering up for someone, that's jail time. l've got my eye on you. [ Rock, lndistinct ] [ Continues lndistinct ] Queen to bishop five. " Check." [ Squawks ] Alex? [ Crossing Bell Ringing ] - [ Squawks ] - [ Car Radio ] [ Groaning ] [ Cocks Gun ] Don't move. [ Screams ] [ Rock, lndistinct ] - [ Gunshot ] -Jesus! Fuck me. l heard you were looking for this. You're the guy who killed Dutton. The way l see it, l want you to think of me as the guy who killed you. l'm a police officer, man! Yeah? What happened to your leg there, Officer? ls that like a hunting accident, huh? [ Screams ] Lauren Randall shot you trying to get free. The 53 stab wounds she died of came from you! Am l right? Ballpark? [ Grunting ] What the fuck do you want? l want Lauren! l want my life back! l wanna know why! lt's all money, man! The girl just got in the way. The scar. Which of you has it? Nobody. lt's just a bullshit fucking story the loser boyfriend made up. [ Siren Wailing ] [ Rock, lndistinct ] Are you out of your fuckin'mind? We're gonna die! How can you die if you're already dead? You're him... Corvis. Fuck! [ Screaming ] [ Helicopter Blades Whirring ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Rock Continues ] [ Siren Wailing ] Go, go! C'mon! Here, here, take it. Fuck! [ Squawking ] [ Squawks ] Daisy. How did you know? l told you. l knew her. You killed that cop, Dutton. And another one. Erlich. Took a wrong turn. l know who you are. That's why you paint your face. To hide. l'm not hiding. l'm right here. You killed Lauren! You killed her! Not me! Dirty cops killed her. Dutton and Erlich! My dad was right. He said you'd ruin her life. No! Listen to me! Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know. This! Look at it. Look at it. Because you need to understand. You need to be careful. l'm sorry. Your father... wasn't right. All right, all right! Listen up! Yo! We've got a cop killer out there. Till we get some l.D., treat everyone like a suspect. He knows. l saw him. He's got a fucking zombie mask. - Calm down. - No, you calm down! Whose name's next on the fucking list, huh? lt's not yours. You didn't testify. You're not on the list. - Scary guy. - Yeah, scary. He survives that crash, takes time out for art? Madden, the old man's requested the pleasure of your company. All right, boys and girls, to quoteJohn Wilkes Booth, "Just watch your backs." - Glad l'm not you. - Right back at ya. Sit down. l thought we had an understanding. l thought we understood that discretion is paramount. - Yeah, we do. - Shut up! Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. l've got reporters asking me how much he made. l've got the entire force looking at this case now. - l know. - You know. l know... the guy, he leaves a sign. No shit he leaves a sign! He's goddamn Picasso. What else do you know? You know this? Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case. Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday. - Guy dressed for Halloween? - Good for you. You do know something. Don't ... say. Just do. Before this whole thing comes tumbling down. [ Sighs ] - ldiots. - Shh. What are you doing? Um, l dropped an earring. Well, it looks like you've got them both on. Alex Corvis didn't kill Lauren. Cops did, didn't they? You're in with them. - lt isn't what you think. - You killed her! No! Erin! lt wasn't supposed to happen! - Stay away from me! - Erin, please. lt wasn't supposed to happen. - She found out. - About you? About them. You have to leave this alone, sweetheart. Don't call me that! Don't call me anything! l would never do anything to hurt Lauren or you. - You have to believe me. - l don't believe you. - Please. - They killed Alex because of you, Dad. Now you killed both of them. - Please, leave him alone. - Get your hands off me. Calm down! Put your hand down! - l'm not makin' this up. He had a crow with him. - That's what you're tellin' me. He said l lied at his trial. lt's Alex Corvis. So now we're talkin' about a ghost... with a fuckin' pet bird, is that right? [ Crying ] - Turn that-- Turn that fuckin' baby down! - Shh! - [ Crying Continues ] - l wanna show you somethin' See this? See this here? Come here. l wanna show you something, all right? See that? My name's next on his list. lt's fuckin' next. l want you to tell me who it is, Tommy. - lt's Corvis. lt's Alex-- - Take your time. l want you to think about it. 'Cause you gotta give me something other than this bullshit you been spewin' He said the whole trial was a setup. He said l caused an innocent kid to die. ls that true? ls that true? [ Laughs ] [ Tommy Groaning, Screaming ] [ Gun Cocks ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Gunshot ] Alex? Come on. Check... and mate. Dream on. Oh, my God. That really is you under there. Two down. Two to go. Down? Wait, don't tell me. The cops... at my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. You think l'm crazy. No. l'm thinking... it explains a lot. Lauren's father is involved. He bought these cops fancy cars. And l don't know what else. lt's a company called D-E-R-T. l think Lauren found out. What-- What do they do that they had to kill her? l was hoping you'd find out. l sure will. [ Squawking ] - [ Squawking ] - Boo! [ Squawks ] What's with this bird? Keeps hangin' around. Alex? [ Squawks ] This is where it happened. Yeah, l know. Are you okay? When Lauren was missing, the cops came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right? But now l know they had her. And the reason they brought her here, and they knew they could blame it on you, is that l sent them here! l told them she came here sometimes with her dirtball boyfriend! That's exactly what l said! Erin, it's not your fault. [ Crying ] Oh, God, l wish l were dead. - No, you don't . - Yes, l do. There were four of them! - [ lndistinct Chattering ] - Get her out of the car. - C'mon, baby. - No! No! No! - Hold on. C'mon, baby! - No! No! Be nice, would ya? You wanna see a little somethin' [ Alex ] Four large men, and still she grabbed one of their guns. -[ Gunshot ] - [ Screams ] And she ran. She ran for her life! l don't wanna know! She ran, them breathing down her neck... all the way from the road... to here. [ Alex ] Here's where it happened. She turned and faced them and went down, kicking, and punching... and tearing at them as they stabbed her. Fifty-three times. [ Screaming, Crying ] She fought for her life... because life is worth living. Think about that. [ Whispering ] Think about that. And you tell me how much you wish you were dead. - Why wasn't this incident reported? - Nothing to report. All the prisoners were present and accounted for. - So you pretended nothing happened? - Hey, Corvis fried. l don't see how it could've been him. No, l wouldn't expect you to. Be forewarned. Nature takes its toll. Bon appetit. Okay, you lost him. Now clear out. - They botched the execution. - Yeah, you could say that. Christ! lt was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right. Hey, babe? Fuckin' crow. Sign of the dead come back to life. How about sign of a big black bird? The dead can return given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that. l've studied this phenomenon before. He's looking for something. Won't stop till he finds it. Sometimes, the best way to get rid of someone is... to let them have what they want. The man with the scar. [ Laughs ] [ Captain ] Give him the man with the scar, then he'll lose his powers. The man with the scar... took everything l ever cared about. Left me with nothing. So you're going to kill him? l have to find him first. You know what Lauren and l were fighting about that night? She had a secret. Wouldn't tell me. My father. All l knew was she was pulling away. lt made me crazy. l used to be so proud of him. My big-deal daddy. And now... he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is... l wish l could hate him, but l can't . He said he'd never hurt either of us. And l know it's true. And l'm going back. lt's what Lauren would do. l wanna forget. Forget everything. Keep it. lt connects you to Lauren. And it connects you to me. No matter what happens, l'll make sure everyone knows that you're innocent. That you loved her. lf you need me, you know where to find me. - You know it doesn't work this way. - l'm out of this,John. Partnerships don't end like that. Friendships don't . Our friendship... ended when Lauren died. [ Sighs ] Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? - Because there's a ghost threatening us. - You mean Alex. l mean Lauren. Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident. Your men killed my daughter. - An accident, Nathan. - She was 1 8 years old. There were four of them. They stabbed her 53 times. Where's the accident,John? Where's the fucking accident? l watched her grow up, just like you. l know how her mind worked. She was snooping around because she was worried about you, about what you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me... and blame yourself. l do... every day. Erin knows, doesn't she? Don't bother. You never were a good liar. Look at this. Everything we've worked for. Now, you tell me. What are we going to do? Dad? You home? [ Dripping ] [ Dripping Continues ] [ Dripping Stops ] [ Dripping ] [ Dripping Continues ] [ Screaming ] D-E-R-T is owned by Westwind Builders, Nathan Randall's company. But DERT, in turn, owns a dozen other corporations. That's a big mess to wade through, so l checked out Tommy Leonard. Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. You understand? l want the king. We're getting there because, in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called The Key Club. - The strip joint? - l believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DERT. Places like this, they're about unreported cash, processing money from drugs, prostitution. So l took a chance. l called over there, asking for Roberts and Toomey, the two other cops. Whoever answered said, " They're not here. This is the front office." [ Pounding At Door ] Alex! They killed my dad. [ Crying ] l can't take it. Erin? Erin? Who? l don't know. l found him lying there. Where is it, this place? - l think we should get some support. - What, call the police? What is this? Where are you going? [ Rock ] Hey, you have some l.D., pal? Circus in town, or what? -[ Gunshot ] -[ Girls Scream ] How old are you? You have one chance to value your life. Take it. We'll be safe in my car. Nobody will recognize it. We'll put yours in back. [ Gasps ] You followed me here. No. Erin, l put a bulletin out on your car because... there's bad news, and l thought you should hear it from me. Your father got involved with some bad cops on my force. So l take responsibility. He killed himself. How? How'd he kill himself? With a gun. With a gun, right? When there wasn't one anywhere near where you found him! - You killed him. - Erin, don't. - Back the fuck off now! - He left this. There's names, addresses. There's a note to you. These people he got involved with, they killed Lauren. He couldn't bear it anymore. Oh, my God, he's right. lt's all here. The note. Show it to me. Not you! Show it to me. lt's right here. Look, under here. Look. You need help? Finish him. Lauren? You were here? [ Toomey ] Hey. Hey, c'mon. Wake up. Wake up. Hey. Come on, Sampson, wake up. Come on. You awake, Sampson? You awake? Not anymore. Shit. That's Randall's daughter. She saw us. Go, go, go! Get her! Gentlemen. Cheers. Find him! Go. Toomey! [ Beeping ] Spark, gas. Bad combination. And it's not this leak here that's the least of your worries, ya know? You're him. Jesus, you're Corvis! We fried your ass! You're a dead man! - Good thing, in a situation like this. - You're a fuckin'zombie. Son of a bitch. - The scar! - There is no scar! [ Squawking ] lt's over. [ Siren Wailing ] l'm losing you. [ Lauren's Voice ] Come on, Alex. Lauren? What'd you do that for? He's bleeding. l don't -- l don't bleed. Erin? The king. l hate that picture. Where is she? Can l get you something? Glass of water? Transfusion? Last chance. Where's Erin? Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet? You know, crime was actually down before you showed up. Or, uh, stuck around, or whatever the hell you're doing here. What are you doing here? l'm looking for my friend. See, l heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? Did you find him? Yes? No? You're like the guest who would not leave. And,judging by your condition, maybe you've overstayed your welcome. lt's not a criticism, it's just an observation. Oh. l don't think you're gonna use it. That's Lauren's knife. You come in here so full of righteous indignation. What have you got to be... so righteous about, huh? How many innocent people did you leave dead back there? l had no choice. You sent them. Bullshit! You're a killer, that's all you are. Just a clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong? Huh? You did the world wrong. You and Lauren had a fight, and you couldn't let it go. [ Groaning ] [ Gasping ] - [ Crying ] - What is your problem? - Why won't you tell me? - l can't tell you! l just-- l just can't . l-- - Come back here! Come here! - No! Stop! [ Shouts ] lt was bad enough her dad rejected you, but when she did... -you lost it. - You're wrong. Yeah? Well, l see doubt oozing out all over you. Where do people go who kill their girlfriends? - Screwed-up kid. - [ Knife Plunging ] He stabbed her 53 times. Where will he end up? Take a look, you sick fuck! That's who you are. Are you looking? Every loser name anybody ever called you is true. - [ Knife Plunging ] - Are you looking? l never meant to hurt her. [ Captain ] You see it? [ Warden ] Alexander Frederick Corvis, do you have any last words? l loved Lauren. l never meant to hurt her. [ Captain ] Did you see it? Did you see it? Yeah, l think you fuckin' saw it. [ Clapping ] Lucky, huh? l guess he found the arm you planted. A fake picture's worth a thousand words, huh? Just don't believe everything you see. Doubt is a motherfucker. Give me a hand with this sack of shit. Oh, he's cute! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Was cute. All but the face. Well, makeup can work for you... or against you, right? All done. Very nice. [ Makes Kissing Sound, Laughs ] - You're such a good listener. - [ Captain ] Clear the table. l've read about this, but l never thought l'd see it. So, was he alive or dead? l've seen birds stuffed and mounted so lifelike... you'd swear you saw them breathing. Yeah, maybe we've got a case of that here. Get me my kit. The two of you are majorly demented. You know that? He should've gone home when he found the scar we planted. He came to save her. Caring for the living. Not part of his job description. Oh. Ahh. - Fifty-three? - ln all the excitement, l guess l lost count. Mmm. Ooh. Think l'll mount him with his head up his ass. - [ Squawking ] - Grab it! And it connects you to me. No matter what happens, l'll make sure everyone knows... that you're innocent. l promise. Oh, man! Everything you ever showed me, all lies. [ Groaning ] - l'll kill her. - No! Oh, l'd love to hurt ya! - [ Yells ] - Got you! That bird! Kill it! [ Squawking ] You brought him back. Good. He owes you. Where did they go? [ Creaking ] [ Groaning ] [ Screaming ] [ Groaning ] - l know you too well. You won't do it. - You don't know me at all. Aah! God! [ Gun Clicks ] There's only one in the chamber. That's all you get. Holy mother of God! [ Squawking ] The devil himself. [ Engine Revving, Tires Screeching ] What the fuck? [ Tires Screeching ] [ Squawking ] The jolt, eight amps at 2,000 to 3,000 volts. lt lasts a few seconds. The current surges and is turned off. Then they check to see if the heart is still beating. lf it is... ba-boom! Another jolt is applied. Experts say unconsciousness... occurs before pain has time to register. They agree that electrocution... does not hurt. But it does. Unimaginably... believe me. l... don't expect a call from the governor. Any last words... Captain? Yeah. Fuck you! Was that it? l'm not dying for your goddamn illusions! You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future taken from you? Bullshit! She was already bored. Why do you think she was lookin' around? You're nothing, Corvis. Less than nothing! You can't do this to me, you little fucks! You hear me? You understand? l'll be back! Just like you! A big, fucking, shit-spewing bird! And guess which little bitch l'm taking out first! You are so dead.
