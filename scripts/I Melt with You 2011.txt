New data suggests that global economic recovery is weakening, as there will be fraud charges against six Wall Street... - Ronnie? - Yes, baby? - Are you okay in there, hon? - You know I am.

What, have you got a painting of yourself in an attic somewhere? Come on, what's the secret? For old times' sake? Huh? Huh? Maybe a drink. To start, anyway. Love the car, by the way. Very you. Yeah, I bought it from some guy on the way from the airport. You know, just saw the sign, and, pow... impulse buy. I intend to destroy it in the next four days. Some things never change, Richard. What is it? Timmy? Jill's. I've been wearing it again. Five years ago this month. God, has it really been that long? Jesus. I'm so sorry. Every time I see you, you say those words, and I always believe you. And you never try to tell me to forget. But, per usual, it is my job to remind you that this week is about forgetting all that, if only for the moment. Hmm? Mm-hmm. Oh! He lives. He lives! Look, you cannot be cynical and expect to have any kind of success in this world or any other, especially if you claim to be an artist. I'm tired... sick and tired of cynical artists. Ronaldo's here. Uh-oh, my liver just had a heart attack. Hey, if you need anything else, I'd be happy to pick it up for you in the morning. This is her. God, so pretty. - She's all grown up, Ron. - It's crazy, huh? Hey, um, is she getting cock yet? I pray for your soul, Richard. You cannot pray for a soulless man. Oh, yeah? Ronaldo, let me ask you this. Yeah. When your 16-year-old daughter's hot friends come by, do you ever think about what it might be like to fuck 'em in the ass till they're cross-eyed? - I told you! See? See? - Shut the fuck up. - Pass the blow. - Told you. Jesus, some things never change, huh? Hey, hey, I merely say what others think... - Mm-hmm. ...but fear to say. You want some, honey? No, don't tell Mommy. Oh, my God, look at this. It's the first time in the history of Internet real estate photography the place is as big in real life as it was online, huh? It's beautiful, Ron. Perfect. Let me know when you want to settle up. It's already settled. The rich are different from you and me, Timothy. Thank you, Ron. We've always been different. I love you. You're welcome, by the way. Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you. - I was there! - You were not there. - You weren't there. - Of course I was there. - I popped my head out... - I'm the guy that gets busted. - You get busted... - I'm the guy. I pop my head out... 'cause all I wanted... - I ran off. ...to let you know, 'cause I was gonna bail you out, so I said, "How much for bail?" And he looks at me and he goes, "That's him. - That's him right there." - "That's the guy!" - Well, he was the guy. - The cops fuckin' bust me, and... You weren't there. I don't remember... - Of course I was there! I ran off. - You weren't fuckin' there. No, you weren't there. - The doctor is in! - Hey, Doc. - He certainly is. - Yes! - What and how much? - Enough to treat the illnesses at hand. - Welcome, my friend. - My man, Ron! Look at him. He's beautiful. He can't afford a razor. Someone get me a drink while I urinate. All right. This is an announcement for the transcendental run  The train now standing leaves for higher planes  Due to a derailment, there will be no other trains  So why not hop on this one?  Hear the porter's glad refrain...  So Amanda, during her pregnancy, is getting incredibly... Nauseous. - And what do you think it was from? - Do tell! I'm dying to know. - It was me. - Of course it was. It was my scent. No, seriously. Four months of her pregnancy, I have to sleep in the other room, okay? But... but I have become a professional masturbator. - No, no, no... - What the fuck is this shit? What are we talking about? I see you guys once a fuckin' year. - It's my life. - Doc... how's the world of dating, pal? - It is what it is. - Oh, come on. You sedate them, and then it's your right and your privilege to take what's rightfully yours, correct? - Oh, my God. - I hope you're doing that. Really. Why don't you tell us about what you told me about... the 20-year-old woman? Thanks, Richard. I don't think I can stay here for this. - Come on. - Amongst friends. I don't think I can stay here. When you told me, it just sounded like you should fucking get it off your chest, you know. - I mean, you... - What? It was a one-time-only thing. And the girl came in late in the day. She was pretty, to say the least, and it had been a while for me. And I... used anesthesia on her. Yeah. Let's skip to the part where you sent the receptionist home. I did things. I mean, I basically lost control. And looking back on it, I really feel that I shouldn't have... Oh, you fucker! Fuck you! Alley-oop! Slam dunk, motherfucker! The man said childhood  It's in his childhood...  Hey, fuckin' Scarface, how about a little on this end of the table? - Come on. - It was out of control  I had the opinion it was out of control  Oh, oh...  It was that girl Emily. She lived in the house next to us. Yeah, yeah. And who was the guy? - It was Simon... Simon Tuller. - No, no, no, it wasn't. You know, I actually fucked Emily, just... and who else? - Guilty as charged. - I didn't. - She gave me crabs. - She gave you the crabs? I fucked her boyfriend Jeff Snyder. Oh, great. Well played. - That's so fucking funny... - What? because when I fucked Emily, I gave her crabs, which basically means I gave you the crabs! Hey, fuck off! I banged her... when I banged her, I knew that I had the fucking crabs. There you go, mac. Here, take them back. Here are your crabs back, you fuck. The gift that keeps giving, huh? You still have 'em, sir? You know how to get rid of 'em? By the way, this is true. You take a really good, good lighter, and you shave one testicle, and you light the other testicle on fire. - The critters run from... - Critters! the burning testicle onto the shaved one. Okay, and then you take an ice pick, and you just jam it into the fuckers! Aah, aah! True. Is it possible to have a conversation that's a little more serious? - No, no! - No! - Come on. - Fuck that. That's what I fuckin' hate, man. Is people... we... we can no longer do and say the things that make us feel good. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Are you saying that doing and saying stupid things makes you feel good? You know what I'm talking about. Like, when we get past 40, we can no longer be honest about what makes us laugh. And if you're a father, forget it. You show any immaturity, you lose all credibility. Oh, come on. Blah, blah, blah. - Come on, that's pathetic. - You are pathetic, Ron, because... - What? - You don't need to participate in a conversation that might be illuminating because you're such a powerful man. Oh, no, that's not fucking it, by the way. I am here to talk about Volvos... - vulvas. - Volvos! - I got one of those. - And schlongs. Happy birthday to you, Timothy!  Happy birthday! Yeah! Happy birthday, baby. Happy birthday, Timmy. - Look at that. - She's got a beard. Of course she does. Look it, she's got a man-gina. - See? I didn't forget about you. - You never do. I love you, pal. Happy birthday. I guess I can die now. Do it when no one else is around, please. - Thanks, guys. - We're all glad you were born. - Happy birthday. - Timmy! Here's to us. - Us band of brothers! - Yeah! Whoo! I wanna be adored  I wanna, I wanna  I wanna be adored  I wanna, I wanna  I wanna be adored  I wanna, I wanna  I gotta be adored  I wanna be adored.  Why do you dislike rock 'n' roll so much? These days, it's a disease. It's a plague. It's been going on for too long. It's history. It's not achieving anything. It's just digression. They play rock 'n' roll at airports. It's about as, like, advanced as it can possibly get. But there was a time when you didn't feel that way. It is too much like a structure, a church... - Yeah, but there was a... - Man #2:a religion, a farce. A time when you did not feel that way. - What made you change... - No, I've always felt this way. Even when you were working with the Sex Pistols? I wondered when you'd get round to that one. - Ahh. - Yes, even then, because the Sex Pistols was going to be the absolute end of rock 'n' roll, which I thought it was. Unfortunately, the majority of the public, being the senile animals that they are, got that wrong. Where did the name the Sex Pistols come from? Who thought that name up? Some animal. I can't remember. It doesn't matter. It's history. Well, I think history matters a little bit. When you say "some animal," was this a member of the band... History does not matter. I mean, your program is called "Tomorrow." There must be a reason behind that. Well, unless we remember our yesterdays, there will be no tomorrows. Getting back to the public image... Charlie don't surf, and we think he should  Charlie don't surf  And you know that it ain't no good  Charlie don't surf for his hamburger mama  Charlie's gonna be a napalm star  The reign of the superpowers must be over  So many armies can't free the earth  So, soon the rock will roll over  Africa is choking on their Coca-Cola  It's a one-way street in a one-horse town  One-way people starting to brag around  You can laugh, put them down  These one-way people gonna blow us down  'Cause Charlie don't surf, and we think he should  Charlie don't surf  And you know that it ain't no good  Charlie don't surf for his hamburger mama  Charlie's gonna be a napalm star...  Charlie don't surf, he'll never learn  Charlie don't surf though he's got a gun  Charlie don't surf, think that he should  Charlie don't surf...  We really think that he should  Charlie don't surf  Charlie don't surf.  Whoo! - That was mine! - Fuck you. - English Beat. - "Twist and Crawl." - Whoo! - Depeche Mode. - Uh, "Personal Jesus." - The Cure. - "Boys Don't Cry." - "Killing an Arab." - X. - Uh, "Johnny Hit and Run Paulene." And I win, 'cause I got Timmy, you all right down there? Wanna go for a ride? Now! Come on. Come on. Whoo! Come on, Timmy. More, more! - Gotta get a hard-on. - I can't! This is so bad! Fuck, yeah! Fuck you! Whoo! Whoo! Come on, faster! Let's go faster. Yeah! Whoa, whoa! Whoo-hoo! Ho ho! This is really hard. Whoa, whoa! No! - Are you dead? - Oh. - Fuck! - Oh, fuck. Fuck. - Come on. - Hold on, how do I... Come on. I'll radio for help. To the dunes, man. - How are they gonna find us? - They'll find us. The best swimsuit of all time... - Cheryl Tiegs in the... - The big areolas, like ka-kaw! - Yeah, exactly. - Fuckin' ka-kaw! - She's wearing a hammock. - Here's what I miss, okay. - Yes. - I miss pussy hair. Yeah? - Is that so fucking wrong? - No. Everybody looks like a fucking Barbie doll. You know, you don't want to have a fucking machete and get in there and just... night vision goggles and shit. You want a clean runway. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, my God. Look at this. - Oh, wow. - This is the best I've felt all year, - being here with you guys. - Yes, indeed. Yes. But I know it's because I can't feel anything. - Drugs. - Maybe it's not. Maybe it's... it's us, being together. - Don't just rule that out. - That's why we do this. That's right. The question, Rich, is that why we do this? I love it. I think it's fantastic. I mean, I look forward to it. I plan for it. I need it. I mean, it's like Christmas for me. Or if you're a non-Christian, it's like your birthday. Yeah, or if you're a Jehovah's Witness, don't celebrate birthdays, then it's like the day you get married. You know, it's slightly less subdued than I imagine the typical Jehovah's Witness wedding to be. But at your wedding? My wedding. Oh, man. We are marooned. We are stuck, man. Why don't you have a woman, Rich? I mean, I know you have women... but, like, the woman. Why? Why do I need the woman? Why? Why? You know, you know... to tame you, to train you. I'm... I'm trained. I'm house-trained, you know. Untamed, maybe, but I don't piss on the carpets. It's okay, man, to let a girl love you. Who... who wants this? Hmm? My mother? She's... You fuck lots of women. Have you ever truly loved one? I love 'em all. Can't love 'em all if you only love one. If that's true, that's interesting. Yeah. You want to know what I think, Timothy? When they really get to see me... they don't like what they see. You make sure of that. Maybe. - Whoa ho! - There they... - Whoa ho! - Hey! - Whoa ho! - Up here! Hey, you guys! Well played. Porsches are known for taking up sand dunes. Not gonna work. We've got your energy. Oh, help is here! - It's easy to...  - Here we go. Lay down and hide  Where's a warrior without his pride?  - We're gonna move real good  - Yeah, right  - We're gonna dress so fine  - Okay  It's dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog  Leapfrog the dog and brush me, daddy-o  Makes me proud, so proud of you  I see innocence shining through  Makes me proud, so proud of you.  Thinkin' of blue thunder now  Singin' to myself  Thinkin' how fast it moves...  Wow. I was singin' something  Out on Route 128  - Thinkin' how blue it looks...  - A little artist. Singin' out loud...  The SEC and a government subpoena? Jesus Christ. A subpoena and... - Need a drink? - Yes. Thank you. Recognize anyone here? Oh, jeez. Who the fuck are those people? I don't even recognize that guy. Do you ever get scared? What are you asking me? I guess I'm asking you if your life turned out the way you thought it would. Look, I just want to have a good time, man, okay? I just... all that... that dreamy shit, it's not... it's just... it ain't for me, man. - Not now, not now. - Very hunter and gatherer of you. Well, you've always been more evolved than me, Tim... always. But being part girl will do that to you... help you to develop your sensitivity, you know? I get it. Look, I just... Eyes closed, mouth open. Dilaudid. A morphine derivative. I had a patient who offered me money for a prescription. It changed the landscape of my practice. She had a lot of friends. And this became your practice rather than the one that you imagined you would have. I remember in college saying, "You can write about people, and I can save lives." Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time, for y'all have knocked her up. I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe. I was not offended, for I knew I had to rise above it all, or drown in my own shit... - How you feeling, big fellow? - Fuck off! - Oh, just... - Great. This is great. - Come on, the air, the birds. - Oh, I love it. You kiddin'? Are you kiddin'? The best. You okay, man? Hey, man, it's a brilliant idea, coming out here. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. "I got an idea, let's go fishing. Let's go fishing. Argh argh!" And the best news is, we're gonna be here all day. "It sounds fun!" - Fuck you guys! - We're having a reunion. Give me a pole! Let's do it. What you got for me? No, wait. I'll take his place. Hey, Timmy, I think I got one! Oh, shit. So... this is a reunion, huh? We all went to college together. Jonathan and Richard have known each other since grade school. We meet every year somewhere. That's nice. It's... it's nice. - It's good to catch up. - Sure is. I left school when I was 14. The sea kept me moving, so I never had any reunions, except for with my wife after long fishing trips. She died 11 years ago. Cancer. So I spend most of my days out here just drifting around, trying to figure things out. I realize I was... I was lucky to have felt something that looked or smelled or... resembled real love. Most folks never taste that. I tasted it, and it made every day anointed. Nothing mattered when we were together. And when we were apart... I felt him. I felt him like my own breath. Do you believe in heaven? I wish I did. All righty, boy, all righty, boy.  - Are you still writing? - Yeah. Yeah, I write. I write all the time, Ron. I write report cards. I write on chalkboards. I write to the school board and ask for more money. And sometimes I write, "Dear God, when You get a chance, can You tell me why I've got nothing to write about?" What does that gibberish mean, man? I'm a... I'm an English teacher now. For now, I'm a teacher of English. How is Amanda? I tell you, Rich, man, sometimes I can't believe that I chose so well. I wake up with that warm body next to mine, and I just... Yeah, you're a lucky man. She doesn't push me or question me, you know? We respect what we both do, and it's defined. I know my role. But I still don't know why I've done the things that I've done. I'm in trouble, Rich. I'm in deep, over-my-head, drowning, motherfucking... trouble. - You want me to go get the food? - All right, yeah. Sounds good, man. Did you have the large order to go? Yeah, well, is there anyone else here who might have my order? - Just one. - God damn, I bet you that's mine. Would you like to pay now? Oh, yeah, ahem, of course. Would you like to go home with my order? I'm working. And you should probably work on your lines. If I work on my lines, would you consider my offer? No. Yeah. She likes me. She likes me. Looks like you're feeding an army there. - Walk out with me. - What? I want you to take that apron off, throw it on the floor, walk around the bar, and leave with me right now. You're really high, aren't you? You say that like you like it. I'm gonna give you my number. I'm in town for three days. I got three friends. We're harmless and fun. Maybe you've got three friends, you want to come over, it's up to you. But, hey, if you're planning on throwing that away and not calling me... wait till I'm about 'Cause I'm sensitive like that. Richard, I'm moist. You are a very sick man. Bass  Ooh, white, white  Ooh, white lines  Vision dreams of passion  Blowin' through my mind  And all the while I think of you...  I don't think I've ever heard anything like this. It's one for the record books. The more I see, the more I do  - Something like a phenomenon  - Baby  Telling your body to come along  But white lines  Blow away...  All right, you motherfuckers. I can be reached on my pager. Fair enough. Oh, ladies will be here in five. - Bass  - Blow  Ticket to ride, white line highway  Tell all your friends they can go my way  Pay your toll, sell your soul  Pound for pound, costs more than gold  The longer you stay, the more you pay  My white lines go a long way  Either up your nose or through your vein  With nothin' to gain except killin' your brain  Freeze...  Rock  Freeze  Rock, blow  Higher, baby  Get higher, baby, get higher, baby  And don't ever come down  - Freebase!  - I couldn't be more married. - Do you still have sex with your wife? - That's private, Randolph. That means you don't. I actually... I do. He does, I know. I know he does, a lot. How the fuck would you know that? She's always too tired to fuck me. How do you have sex with the same person over and over again, year in and year out? So, versus what, like, having sex with random people over a long period of time, huh? I fucking love that you just said that. You know what... the first time that I ever saw my father have sex with my mother, I thought that he was killing her. How did they explain themselves? My father soothes a seven-year-old's mind... he got down on one knee, and he said to me very gently, he said, "Son, I was not hurting your mother. I was simply fucking her brains out." Tear your hair for your aggression  Fight in London, risk detention  Master race or masturbation  Causes natural good sensation  Who am I to say to the IRA  To the UDA  Soldier boy from the UK?  Am I just a hypocrite  Another piece of your bullshit?  Am I the dog that bit the hand of man...  Your garden variety MX missile. M for mushrooms, and X for... X. They're better when you're sober with an empty stomach and no other drugs. You sound like a doctor. I'm studying to be one. I ain't never comin' back  Baby, baby  Won't you hear my plea?  Yeah, come on, sugar...  Holy shit, man. You're letting your demon out. I'm on vacation. Aah! Turn it up! Baby, baby, drove up in a Cadillac...  - Whoo-hoo! - I said, "Jesus Christ"  "Where'd you get that Cadillac?"  She said, "Balls to you, Daddy."  I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation  You're living in the past, it's a new generation  And I only feel good when I've got no pain  And that's how I'm gonna stay  And I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation  - Oh, no  - No, no, no, no, no, no  - Not me  - Me, me, me, me, me, me  - Oh, no  - No, no, no, no, no, no  - Not me  - Me, me, me, me, me, me  - Not me  - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  - Me, me, me, me, me, me  - Not me!  Anyway, this rich guy Greenberg moves into town, and he's building this ugly 25,000-foot mansion right on the ocean in front of my mom's house. Here, hit this. She's tried to stop him legally, but he just crushes her with his money. Fucker's putting in a helicopter pad. Hey, you know, if the guy can live like a king, why the fuck not? Why is total excess equated with living like a king? I mean, why do people need all that shit? 'Cause the shit is there. That's crazy. You... you actually believe that? Mm-mm. I don't believe it, I know it. No, you can't know something if it's a choice. Where did you learn that college bullshit, from your philosophy professor? I'm just saying people don't need certain things, even though they might think they do. How the fuck would you know what people need? Who pays your tuition, huh? Who pays your fucking rent? Mom and Dad. You're a little fucking infant in diapers, you fucking bitch. Why don't you come and talk to me when the naivet wears off, all right? Walking back to you  Is the hardest thing that  I can do...  Jane. Jonathan, do you have any idea what time it is? - Um... - 5:30 in the morning. Miles is sleeping. I just want to hear his voice. And you know that Daniel works late. Yeah, so he can control the fucking world's oil markets. How does he make so much money when the rest of the country is so broke? Are you drunk? No, I'm fuckin' high. I'm high as fuckin' shit. You get together with your old friends, and you can't even pretend that you're grownups. I'm pretending that you still love me. Jonathan, stop. I'm hanging up. Jane, just... just tell me again how it went from you loving me to not loving me. Just like honey  Just like honey...  Just like honey  - Just like honey  - Just like honey  - Just like honey  - Just like honey.  Hope, 'cause that's what a... that's what paper is. And you gotta stay on top of it. What kind of shit do you write? I just write stories, things that mean something to me. Ah, the personal stuff. Oh, God, no, he's so great. I mean, he's... he's really amazing. And then so you... you submit them, right, to... to quarterlies, crap like that? My last one actually ran in the "New Yorker." We were all so proud. Oh. And then you'll write another one, and then you'll get the heat behind you, and then you... that will... that will push you through to write the novel, to type "The end." And then fucking what? I don't understand. I mean... is there something wrong with that? You published a book. I'd love to be able to do that. I was... I was like that. I was so fucking excited about this, and... and about that, but you just... you think it's gonna be so fucking rosy, so fucking rosy... - Well, Jonah's not like that. - No? He doesn't think anything's gonna be some certain way. - He just loves to write. - You don't have to speak... You... you live in some sort of disillusionment, because it's easier than being honest. - Wow. - What are you hiding from, old man? You think that he's gonna be like you when he's older... 'cause it makes you feel better about yourself. I still love it. Factory towns  Oh, to be  The cream  Oh, to be  The cream  Oh, to be  The cream  Oh, to be  The cream  Oh, to be  The cream.  Let me see your heart. You look... you look just like my sister Jill. You should ask her to come over. - Then I can judge for myself. - That's impossible. She's dead. She's gone. How'd she die? I know it hurts, but you can tell me. I killed her. I killed her... I killed my boyfriend. I killed... I killed them in a car. This place we live, this is a state, a stop on the way. True nirvana only happens when you die. They were lucky. Death is something to attain. Do you see them alive when you close your eyes to go to sleep? Let me be her. No! God, Tim! Rich! Richard! Ron, Richard! No! Help! Help, help, help! Oh, God! Timmy! Timmy! God, help me! Get him down! Help, Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Get him down. Get him down. - There shouldn't be blood. - Help me out. Hold his head! Hold his head! Hold his head! Ron! - Timmy! Tim! - Let's go. - Let's go. - Tim! - Ron! - Come on. Tim, Tim. Come on. Tim, come on! Come on, do it! Get it! Tim, Tim, Tim. Timmy, Timmy! Wake up, Tim. - Rich. - Oh, God. - Hey, hey. - He's dead. - What? - What's going on? - He's fuckin' dead! - What's going on? He's gone! Would you fucking listen to me? - What are you fuckin'... - He's fuckin' gone! - What happened? - He's gone! Our fucking friend is gone. Let him be, let him be. - Tim. - Okay. He even shaved. "25 years from now..." What are we supposed to do? What are we supposed to...? Motherfucker beat me to the punch. Somebody help me, because I'm... I'm lost here. I'm not. I remember everything. Senior year, the room upstairs, the green couch, the slanted walls, the Joy Division posters all over the walls - like it was yesterday. - It was Timmy's idea. He said, "Will we ever remember this moment? Will we ever have friends like this?" "Will we ever feel this way again? This alive, this free, this possible again?" Oh, God, I... I'll never forget it, and yet... I forgot it. We all did. We all forgot it. Tim didn't. Look, we all said a lot of things when we were young. Okay. Okay, so this... this means nothing to you? Your word's no good. Look, we're gonna call the police now, right? And say what? That we signed an oath, and now our friend is dead? "Please come pick up the body"? Who gives a fucking shit? Fuck. Timmy obviously did. You know, he remembered what we wanted to be, and... so do I. You're... this is insane, by the way. We're high. We are high as shit. Which is why we need to just think this through. Look, we just need to come down, all right? - Sleep it off, all right? - I can't come down, okay? Now, well, hold... okay, okay, I'm confused... shut the fuck up. I'm confused. Are we talking about not calling the cops? All our names are on that note. That piece of fucking shit scrawl signified means nothing! I'm not the same fucking fool who signed that. Neither are you, all right? Things change. No, you certainly are not the same person, Ron. What the fuck does that mean? Okay, so our bond is no good to you, a promise we made... none of that means anything. Your dead friend... It means we fucking think about it. It means that I am not the same person. None of us are. You're not the same person? You're not the same fucking friend? - Fuck you. - Fuck you. I'm a father. - And? And? - And so are you! Jonathan sees his son once every two weeks, and his son calls his stepfather "Dad." You write your name in blood, and... and it means what? Your blood means hooey to you. So, you go home, Ron. Go to your mother. Go to your wife, who you love, and you go explain to her how badly you fucked up, okay? You failed. You disappointed. And how badly did you fuck up, huh? You greedy cocksucker. What did you do? You a bank robber? Hmm? Steal people's money? A bank robber now? Bang, bang, bang! Ronnie the bank robber! Tell us! Did you go bad on us? Are you like the hideous men we read... Jonathan, did our little Ronnie go bad on us? Yeah, hello, we have an emergency. What the fuck are you doing? Listen, someone has committed suicide. We have to call the cops. We have to report this. - That's... - This is who we are. If, when we wrote it, we were not that... Let me just get this straight... you want me to sign off on some 25-year-old idealistic piece of bullshit that I don't even remember? Richard, are you kidding me with this? This is not a reality. This has nothing to do with now. - Tim is dead. - No, Timmy died for his reasons. That's right. You know, guilt... I know he could never live with himself, but he did it. - He was weak. - That was... that was his choice, pal. That was his life. You know what... you never followed through on a motherfucking thing in your entire life, not even then. You know what we used to call you behind your back, buddy? "Rat Ron." Rat Ron. Because you were a fucking rodent. You were selling us tickets to concerts that you got for free. You were trying to fuck Jonathan's girlfriend. Rat fucking Ron... always had to be the man, the man with the plan. Well, you tell me... tell me, Rat Ron, is that why you're in so much trouble now? You fucking loser. Where are all your best-sellers, huh? Where are all your fucking best-sellers, you fucking hack? Did you forget when Rat Ron bailed you out of jail when we were seniors? You forget about that? Because your mommy didn't have any fucking money? Arty little Richard with no fucking money. And Ron had all the money, 'cause that was my fucking role. You were art, I was commerce... that's what you said. - You remember that? - Yes. And you... how much money did I make for you over the years, you fucking zombie quack fuck? Let me... let me try to lay this out for you in a language that you can understand, okay? The way I see it, you got two choices. You can stay here. You can die there. 'Cause I got a feeling no matter what kind of bullshit you wrapped yourself up into, man, you are in it so deep, it is going to fuck you in the ass and swallow you whole. This is insane. This is fucking insane. Oh, my God. Fucking Timmy. I think you should leave, Ron. I think it's best. All right, I'm gonna go pack up my stuff, all right? I'm gonna take off. I'm going home. I just want to make it clear that I left before any of this happened, all right? All right. We should do something about Timmy. Hey, Ron, it's me. The police are here... The courage of the coward  Is greater than  All others...  Now the fuckin' FBI is here, so please get here. I need you to call me, please, please. I have no idea what's going on. A scaredy-cat will scratch you  If you back him in a... in a corner  But I  I  Am  A coward  I, I  I  Am  A coward  I  Am  A coward.  This is all Timmy's. That's good. It's really beautiful, Richard. Hey, fellas. Captain Bob. It's good to see you. You, too. Where's your buddy Tim? He, uh... Yeah, he... he had some other plans... - Yeah. - Pretty sudden. - Had to take off. - Yep. Gee, he must have been disappointed to have to leave. Yeah. Guess he went home sour 'cause he didn't catch any fish. - Probably. - Probably. Got so embarrassed, he just took off. Yeah, he said he had some important business. Hmm. All right, well, you boys take care. - All right. - See you around. - Oh! - Oh, my God! - Oh! Oh! - Jesus! - Somebody call 9-1-1! - Oh, my God! - Call 9-1-1! - I got him. - They're on their way. - I got him. Come on. Let's go. Live. Let's go, live. Live. What happened? Larry McCauley had a heart attack. - Is he okay? - One of those guys saved his life. - Really? - Yeah. I know 'em. They've been out on the boat with me. And they've been hitting it real hard. They are a motley crew. Not from around here. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Laura Boyd. Sorry to bother you. No bother. What's up? The Athertons sometimes have me pass by and check in. I was in the area. So there's just the four of you here? No, one guy took off. But who's counting? Nobody. Yeah, he, uh... our buddy had to go back to Portland for business. - Are you the doctor? - No, no. He's sleeping after the heroics. - Yes, and it was heroic. - Yeah. You know, I've seen that Porsche somewhere. Oh, uh, yeah, my buddy, he bought it off a local, so probably... - Right, yeah. ...seen it around. And the other one's mine. It's a rental. That one? That one there? That's yours? - What's your name? - Ron. Why? Something wrong? No, no, Ron, there's nothing wrong. You look like shit, Jonathan. I'm making a salad. How long has he been sleeping? Hours. Yo, Ronaldo. Hey, man, um, we got something. You gotta try this. I'm so scared. Of what? You mean Timmy? - That cop that was here? - What we're doing here. Yeah. Amanda left some messages, man. The feds are at my home. I robbed clients, but I never cheated on Amanda. I never cheated on her ever. - All right. - Yeah. - Okay. - Never. And, you know, in the beginning, I was trying to help people, man. I'm trying, you know, to enrich them. And then... ...something gets inside you, some... some rationale, you know. And then you just take a little for yourself, just a little bit, and then... you know, one zero turns into two and three and more and more and more and more and more, man. More. You can't... it's just... it's just a drug, man. You just... you get high and you drift. Why'd you need so much? I love taking care of my family, man. I was the man. I was the man for a while, Rich. I wish you coulda seen me. I really wish you coulda seen me. Amanda... will... will she forgive you? No one will. Will you do it? - Fuck you, Ron. - Please. - Please. Do it. - No. - I can't do it. - Don't... don't... I have to do it. I have to. You don't have to. You... you can go home. You can face it. I've tried, man. I tried. I can't. I tried to think of myself going home and s-s-seeing her and having her look into me... in my eyes, and I... I can't face it. I can't face it. I can't. You have to do it. Please. Come on. Come on. Come on. Please do it. I remember when I met you. You were such an asshole... ...but you were cool. Yeah, you were this dark guy with his dead dad, and I thought you were... you were so cool. You turned me on to "Holiday in Cambodia". Remember that? You remember? And I turned you on to The Pretenders. "You arrived like a day and passed like a cloud. I made a wish. I said it out loud. Everybody heard. It was the talk of the town." Shh, shh, shh. Stop talking now. Okay? Okay. There you go. There you go. Is he awake? Okay, I feel better. What the fuck are we doing here anyway? We're not even here. Fuck. I fuckin' told him to go home, you know. I told him, "Go home." Ronnie never listened to anybody. I could've saved some face  They think that your early ending  Was all wrong  For the most part, they're right  But look how they all got strong...  I fuckin' hate pool. That's why I say, hey, man, nice shot...  Pool's for assholes. Can't handle your beer, huh, faggot? That's why I say, hey, man, nice shot...  Hey. Hey, man! That's our drink, asshole. You made fun of my misfortune, and you made a gay slur. Oh... I drank your drinks. Who the fuck are you? How can that possibly matter? You're gonna buy us two more fuckin' drinks, brother. Or you're gonna buy yourself a taxicab to the hospital. I'm not buying you anything. My friend's a physician, so I get treatment right here should I require it. You're barking up the wrong tree, asshole. I'm your worst fucking nightmare! Wow, you need new material, my friend. "Barking up the wrong tree"? "Worst fucking nightmare"? This guy. You're joking, right? Here, here, I'll give you one. I'll give you one. I fucked your girlfriend so hard in the ass, she cried... for more. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude, dude, I'm sorry. That's been used before, too... By all the motherfuckers who fucked your cock-sucking whore girlfriend in the ass. That's why I say, hey, man, nice shot...  Punish me for what I have done. A good shot, man  That's why I say, hey, man, nice shot  What a good shot, man  A man  Has gun  Hey, man  Have...  - Yes? - Mind if I have a word with you? - Yes. - I heard about the fight last night. Bartender said you got hit pretty hard. Oh, yeah. I deserved it. See, I've got a problem that I need to solve. Yeah? Yeah, your... your buddy Ron said that the rental in the driveway was his, but I checked it out, and it belongs to a Tim Arthurs. - Yeah? - Yeah. - That car there? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's Tim's. Hmm. We're gonna return it for him, because he... yeah, I don't know why Ron would say that. Right. May I speak to him? - Who? - Ron. Um... no. No, he... he had to go. Hmm. Yeah, he left early this morning. - How'd he leave? - I don't know. Taxi. Ah. I don't know. I was sleeping. Passed out. You mind if I look around? You... you really don't have a lot to do around here, do you... in the way of stuff to do? Oh, that's funny. Oh, excuse me, I got... I got a question about that old guy from the diner... how's he holding up? His granddaughter Emily says he's doing just fine. Yeah? Glad to hear he's hanging in there. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. - Is there a problem? Just had a question about your cars. I was hoping I could talk to your friend Ron. - Ron... - Ron took off early, yep. Why are you here? Cars, right? Can I see your eyes? Glasses. Scotch, right? So, how long you guys thinking of staying? We're leaving soon. Tomorrow. That's a good idea. Fuck! Fuck! Richard! We're out of drugs. Oh, no. You know, I remembered, but Timmy fucking did it. He didn't forget. He never fucking forgot. I wanted to be the one. I wanted to be the reason. Go in there, you give them this. Don't say anything, but if they ask, you had a knee operation. But they won't ask. Richard. Oh. Is that what you're looking for? Fuck 'em. Here, I got you something. Is that a comment on my chosen profession? Let's go home. Hello? - Hey, Jane. - Hi, Jonathan. He's right here. Hi. Hey, buddy. - Miles, how are you? - Good. Daddy took me on a helicopter yesterday because he had to meet someone for lunch. I was only a little scared. Miles, I'm your daddy. You know that. We could see the whole city. Miles, Daniel is your stepfather. - I'm your father. - What? Promise me you'll remember that. Miles, come on. We need to go. Oh. I have to go. Miles... Miles... - Mommy and Daddy said. - Miles... promise me you'll remember I'm your daddy. Bye. Oh  You're in my arms  Till there's  No tears  Your love is here  Your love is here...  I love you, Daddy. In this dark  You'll free me...  Don't pretend, Daddy. No pain  It has washed away...  I love you, Jonathan. And the world, how amazing  I love you, Daddy. Your love is here  Your love...  I came to tell you I can't do this. We have main engine start... four, three, two, one, and liftoff. Liftoff of the 25th space shuttle mission, and it has cleared the tower. Houston, Challenger. Roll program. Roger roll, Challenger. Challenger now heading down range. Three good APUs. Velocity 2,257 feet per second. Altitude 4.3 nautical miles. Challenger, go at throttle up. "If we can't remember what this feels like... What this feels like..." - "One we want to live..." - "We'll die..." "As one..." No, it's not right. I gotta get in that house. I need a warrant. - Was it drugs? - Yeah. It's out of control. I mean, it's not recreational, I'll tell you that. Ah! It's okay. Are you here to save me? I need you to tell me where your friends are. Oh, God. You like it? Do you like it? Do you like it? Good? Good? Do you think it can keep me alive all by itself? Can you? I'm here. I love my friends. I... I thought about them when I was weak. But you know what? It only made me feel weaker. You know why? Because... because you... you can't have the past back. No, no. Every time we were together, we're not... we were not present. We weren't here! We were wasted! We were always fuckin' wasted, okay? And we didn't do what we said we would. So, maybe... all this was a way of saying... we remembered. We remembered what we used to feel. Where are your friends, Richard? You want to know where my friends are? I need to know. Tell me. - They're dead. - What? They're buried in the back, in the rocks, in the sand. They're dead. Oh, my... oh, my God. You went back there. What kind of cop are you? You went back there, remember? Richard? Richard! - Shake me...  - Richard! Shake me  Skyscraper  Shake me  Skyscraper  Shake me  Skyscraper.  Oh, God. It's me. Richard, look at me. You don't have to do this. I... you know where we are? It's so fuckin' beautiful! Come here. - But I am so goddamn scared. - Hey. Why? Why are we doing this? You don't have to do this. I'd miss my friends too much. "25 years from now, if we can't remember what this feels like, then we have forgotten this beautiful moment." "Who we said we'd become, our promise to each other, swearing to and by our friends, we will never forget." "See, this life, our life, the one we want to live, and the men we want to be and will be." "To forget this feeling is to fail. And if we forget..." "We will die as one." There's no point in asking, you'll get no reply  Oh, just remember I don't decide  I got no reason, it's all too much  You'll always find us  Out to lunch  Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty  We're vacant  Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty  We're vacant  Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty  But now  We don't care  We're pretty  We're pretty vacant  And we don't care.  Moving forwards  Using all my breath  Making love to you  Was never second best  I saw the world crashing  All around your face  Never really knowing  It was always  Mesh and lace  I'll stop the world and melt with you  You've seen the difference  And it's getting better all the time  There's nothing you and I won't do  I'll stop the world and melt with you  Dream of better lives  The kind which never hate  Trapped in a state of imaginary grace  I made a pilgrimage  To save this humans' race  Never comprehending the race  Had long gone by  I'll stop the world and melt with you  You've seen the difference  And it's getting better all the time  There's nothing you and I won't do  I'll stop the world and melt with you  The future's open wide  I'll stop the world and melt with you  I've seen some changes  But it's getting better all the time  There's nothing you and I won't do  I'll stop the world and melt with you.
