He has been resting for these two days. It is said that he's got to be married. So it means he wants to resign? I don't know. If it's so we should cheer it up. How old is he? Hey, he must be twenty three or twenty four years old. Twenty three or twenty four. What is your husband's occupation? I'm not married yet. Are you? Not married. There are only two people in family, my father and I. Oh, I see. You should get a husband sooner or later. If you meet a good one it will be wonderful. Please come in. Ah. What's the matter? I've just arrived at the Yokohama. Oh? Did your wife get angry last time? No, she didn't. And she even thought it interseting. Really? Drinks make people talk much. Yes, that's right. How old is your kid? What for? 24 years old. There's a good guy and you may want to consider this. For what? Matchmaker, of course! My wife heard of him and he may be interesting about your kid. He's got a good background and is staying in the university for the practice. He's about 29 years old. Yes, sure he is. So...what do you think of this? Hey, I'm talking to you! Have any matchmakes come here? No, they hasn't. We haven't thought about this. Have you? She doesn't have that intention either. She's still a kid and has no sense of women. You're wrong. She has the sense and surely has. Has she? Yes, she has. So just try and that guy is really good. Oh? Horie has just called that he the meet arranged at Classmate's Meeting. When?

Waving his stick with confidence. The cather from Bai Shen is Gu Chuan. The first ball is straight and fast. Kuwata didn't strike and is waiting for the good chance now. And... ...the second one is a little left...sorry to keep you waiting. Now there's a good ball and a bad one. Kuwata who is waving the stick seems to be waiting for the third. The third, a little higher. Ah, is that all? Where did you see Guan Jing? In the trolley-bus. There's a strange man... ...who is collecting the waste newspaper. He seemed familiar with me and I finally remembered he was Hyoutan. Hyoutan was not young any more. I thought he had been dead. It is difficult for him to pass away, and it won't be that easy. Even someone wants to kill him and he won't die. Are you still angry with him? His chinese language has been taunted by that guy. What he has done is beyond of me too far, but past just passed. So we should go for him. If he comes, I will not appear. Please don't do that, this Classmate's Meeting is held especially for him. If you don't come it will be boring. Come on and join in us.

Yes. Thanks. Don't you need it? Ah. Give me this. Yes. Yes. Oh? He doesn't look like the guy. If you watch more carefully, he will be not like the guy, but just on some aspects. Oh? Dad, how's that guy? The second son of Kun Qi family, he's a strong and hardworking guy. I think this guy is good. Michiko maybe likes another guy. Do you think so? Yes. I heard from Ze Xiong that she likes a guy names Miura. Miura? The guy in your company? That guy? What does he look like? He's good. If the guy were he, I would agree. What did Michiko say? I asked her. Though she didn't give me a direct answer, yet she likes him very much. If it were he, that would be OK. Oh? Can you go to ask Mr Miura? Hey, OK, If it were he, that would be OK. Oh? It will be wonderful for her to be with the guy she likes. Michiko will be happy then. You're right, I will ask him about this soon. That's the deal. It's quiet today, is it necessary to play this? Hey, no need any more. What? Nothing. But, if she leaves, dad will feel lonely. But if she still don't get married... Sorry to keep you waiting. Sorry to keep you waiting. Hey. This, two more plates. And this. OK. How? Ah? You can drink a lot. No, just so so. I can only drink two bottles of beer. You...what's the matter? Do you want to get married? Do you have soom good one? Yes, but I don't know whether it is OK. Oh? Really? Really, yes, how? Do you want it? Hey, I cannot understand. Why? What makes you headache? How? Hey. It doesn't matter. You're right, tell you the truth, I have... Do you? Not wife, but I already have... Oh? Someone you know too. Who is it? Jingye Yidai in Commerce Department. Oh, it's she. Is that OK? Yes, OK, she's a good girl. Don't tell the others, I haven't told anyone. I won't. We have an agreement. When? Last time during the travel with company. Oh, you two begin from that time? Oh, you two begin from that time? Don't be lying. I touched her hands. Oh? Which one are you talking about? Forget it. Tell me yours, and I tell you all about myself. Hey. Who is that? It's my young sister. Is that Miss Michiko? Hey. Did Miss Michiko know about this? Hey. If it is really so, I hope you will tell me earlier. I specially asked someone for this. Didn't you say that she didn't want to get married? Really? I said? Yes, you said that. Miss Michiko said so but I don't think there's any hope. How about another bottle of beer? Ah, so it's my fault. What a pity, if it was told a little earlier. It cannot be all satisfactory. You're right. Do you want some more...pork chop? OK. Isn't good? I'm so sorry. If dad noticed that a little earlier, it would be better. But we have to tell Michiko about this. Oh, headache. How? You go. Me? Hey, Michiko seems that she likes Miura very much. I asked her this morning. So let dad tell her. But a poor girl. So how should we tell her about this? Want some Red Tea? Brother, do you want some? OK. Michiko...what't the matter? Come here. Sit down please. What's the matter? Maybe dad is too much careful. I let your brother ask Mr Miura the opinion about you. He didn't deny that he didn't like you. But he seemed that he had a agreement. If I could notice that earlier. I'm sorry. I didn't notice that you like Miura. It was all my forgetful mind that made this, I'm sorry. It doen't matter, dad, let it be. I just don't want to regret. It was better that you've asked him. Oh? So how? Do you want to see the guy dad has mentioned? OK I want to meet him. OK. That's the deal. Hey, you just arrange that. That's great. That's great. I worried that she would cry. I thought she would be dissappointed. But look at her, nothing happened. That's great. What's wrong, sister? Looks like crying. What's the matter. What's wrong? Did that papa force his idea upon you? Just have a meet, if you don't like, refuse him. Anyway, have a meet first, will you? Yes. Well, you agreed? Don't you come down to have a cup of tea? Excuse me, is there anyone home? Yes. Welcome, come in, please. Mr.Horie also come here. Oh? Come in. Have come? Hum, just now.

I have talked about that in the telephone just now. Hum. I thought let they meet each other themselves. Sounds reasonable. Could you please ask him about the time? Which matter? About Miss.Michiko. No, that would make things worse. But I must give them an answer first. What's wrong? Because you are so drawling. Kawai request me, and it's saturday yesterday. There's a young man, not bad. Let them meet at noon. Ok? Hum. Is that girl fine? Hum, she's a good girl. She's my secretary's sister, a little shorter than Michiko. She's beautiful. Really? I'm also worried, so.. Oh?
