What's an Estonian doing hare? It's my factory. What are the crates for? Bombs? No. For tangerines. Tangerines are good. Ok. You have anything to eat? We're hungry. Food is in the house. There. Come, let's go. Sit. Who do you have at home? Nobody. I live alone. Come in. Take your seats. We'll sit, grandpa, but better pack the food, we'll take it with us. Ok. And don't be greedy. Sea what a beautiful girl. Yeah, a beauty. Where's your family? You don't have anyone? They all went home when the war broke out. - Home where? - To Estonia. Why did you stay? Didn't want to. - Your daughter? - Granddaughter. And don't comment. Don't dare. Didn't mean m. Ibrahim! What's this? Food. You are a good man, grandpa. Shame that you're that old. It's a pity that brave men like you get old. So what's going on there? War's raging? Yeah, man. Go away to your Estonia. Not everyone are nice guys like us' Does anyone live in these houses? No, they're all deserted. Only in the one by a plantation, there's one. But he has nothing but tangerines. I'm helping him. We don't care about tangerines. But you have a nice crate business here. Good for you. Margus! Margus! Yeah, wait a minute. Who were they? Some Caucasians. Wanted to eat. They didn't come to me. I know' Listen, did you manage to agree? Yeah. They promised to send 20 soldiers on the 7th. For one day. Damn, one day's not enough. Clearly. We'll pick as much as we can. I'm already on it. Good. If we wait too long, we won't get a damn thing out of here. In a few days it may be pretty fierce up here. Those two also said it'll be war soon. My major said the same. If I make ten crates today, we'll have ZOO. Enough? I don't know. Look for yourself. Some 50 more would be needed. Alright. Don't kill yourself with work, it's five days till the 7th. The sooner the better. War news from the radio. Margus! - Margus! - Yeah. - You didn't get shot? - No. - What happened? - I don't know. This one drove by first, that one was chasing, shooting. Hit the fence, damn, it's all ruined now. I was up the tree. I mean, hid myself. Then they shot from something, bazooka, I guess. Damn, it drives you crazy here. What was it? Calm down. He's wounded. Ga take a look at the van. And be careful. Easy, easy... - So how is it? - All dead. Well, Georgian dzhigits, where are you? Easy. How is it there in the heavens, sons of bitches? Enough! Don't shout, or you will die. Barely managed to stop the bleeding. But Ibrahim was killed? Start the car. The bastards killed him, right? Yes' We'll go and bury him now, but you try to calm down' We'll get a doctor for you. And try to move less. Be careful, grandpa, look out for a tail. The rest of the Georgians may follow, Don't worry, lie quietly. Give me my gun. What for? No one will come here. Give, Anything can happen. I told you, they won't come! Check their pockets, maybe you'll find some documents. What for? Their relatives may came looking. We can take them to their grave then. You're right. The Georgians are mere buys. But that one isn't. Yeah, mere boys. You know what, let's bury the Georgians together and the bearded one separately here. Then we'll know who's where. Alright. That Georgian is alive! Don't worry, it's us. Who's that? Ibrahim? Alive? No, ifs not Ibrahim. Who then? Get some water and a clean towel from the kitchen cupboard. There's a shell fragment in his head. We need Juhan now, otherwise he won't survive. The other one needs a doctor, too. Get Juhan quickly and we need to tow away the van. It's easier with three of us. I've got a good cable. Wait! See that he won't tell anyone. Who does he have to tell? Everyone's gone. His wife. She's already in Estonia. How are you? - In pain? - Not too bad' Thanks to Allah, slightly less' who did you carry in? A Georgian. Gravely wounded. What? You out of your fucking mind, grandpa? I'll whack him anyway. Wasted effort. Alright, I apologise for that word, but they killed my friend. And you didn't kill two of his? Or can't count? Should have killed three. Anyway, I will set that right. No point in treating him. No point. How is he? The Chechen will heal in a week. But the Georgian, I don't know. Depends on his body. What shall we do with the fragment? See that he gets the shots in time, - Don't worry. Why is he raving all the time? Raving is good. He may even survive. I'll come hack same time tomorrow. Did he eat? Some. He's asleep now. Shall we go? Wait. I'll lock the Georgian': Door. We don't know what the madman may come up with. Let's go! Grab the wheel. Tum the wheel right! Right! Very good! Going, going... I thought it would explode. They explode in cinema. Cinema is a big fraud. - How's it going? - Not bad. Made 20 crates, you can bake them. You know... These wounded men will ruin our business. So what shall I do now? Kill Chem? No, I didn't mean that. Just saying. Quit whining. How much did you pick? Yesterday's crates are full. Very good. Did you drop by my house? Yeah, I brought the key. Could have left it under the stairs. What if someone finds it? Who's going to look for a key? They'll bake down the dour if they want to. How are they? The Chechen is well. Ate everything there was. Seems to be recovering. And the Georgian? Did you measure his temperature? What for? His head is all hot, raving all the time. Leave the key. Shall I help you to carry the crates? No need. I'll manage. Do your own things. Went to see the van. You can barely spot it from the road. What were you thinking? I'll whack him anyway, grandpa. Lock him under a thousand locks, I'll get revenge for my friend. It's a holy thing for us, you don't understand this. To kill a sleeping man, even if he's unconscious, is a holy thing? Didn't know, really' Then I'll kill him when he can stand again. It's going to rain. No, it will not. They'll be here soon. They who? Georgians. Dr Russians. And tangerines will remain on trees. You know what they call this war? - The Citrus War. - Meaning? Meaning who will get my tangerines. Come on. They fight for the land. Where my tangerines grow. You have gone out of your mind with your tangerines. As soon as the tangerines are sold, I'll go to Estonia. It's free now. The Georgian came to. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Try not to speak much. My head is aching very much. Don't worry. I'll give you a shot and it will he better. Well, the bastard woke up? Who's that? Don't mind, he's a lunatic. I'll whack him anyway, grandpa. Listen to me! No one can kill anyone in my house, unless I want it to happen! But if you think to do it anyway, you'll have to kill me first. Come on, grandpa. You saved me. You heard what I said. Well, then. I give you my word that I won't kill him in your house. But as soon as he goes out, I'll do my thing. I will hope to see you in Estonia. When will you leave? A car will come in the morning. - Be careful than. - No big deal, half an hour to the airport, and on from there. Godspeed' what are you doing here? Sell your tangerines and come along. The former life is gone. That's it. The end. You know very well why I'm staying. You better think of your granddaughter. Mari is well, I don't worry about her. Juhan. Thank you. Medicines are in the closet, I left the instructions there, too. Take care' Up already? I'm better. Can't lie anymore. My clothes suit you. Easy, easy! You must eat a lot. Recover your strength. I'm not hungry. I'm telling you, eat! - Want some tea? - Yes' Thank you for saving me. You're welcome. Eat. I apologise once more for the bad word I said hack then. I'm nervous. But usually, we honour old people. Very much. Apology accepted. Your wound is painful? Not much. Where did you bury my friend? In the woods. - What's your name? - Ahmed. But you are not interested in my name? I am, - I'm Ivo. I'm a Chechen, a soldier. - A mercenary? - Yes. Understood' - You have a family? - Yes. I went to war because of them. I get paid well. Went to war because of them? Don't start to moralize. I told you that I honour old people, but it's none of your business. None, Ivo. Correct, I'm Ivo. Ivo... Where's my gun? In a safe place. You get hatter, I'll give it back. Even trophy guns of the Georgians. These are yours, mo, right? I want to ask something. Ask then' I have to tell you, if I give my word of honour, I rather die than break it. Right. I'm like that, too. So I don't have to lack that door anymore? Listen, Ivo, you, an Estonian, are rather dying than breaking your word. You are asking me, a Caucasian, a mountaineer, if I keep mine? For us, it means everything. I promised not to kill in your house, so I won't. Very well' But an Estonian or a Caucasian, it does not make any difference. Ivo, why didn't you leave for Estonia? But that is none of your business, young man. Our work is completely pointless, if we won't get any help. I have only picked two crates doring that time. Can't pick any more. If the help will not arrive tomorrow, we are screwed. What did the major exactly tell you? That they'll come if something will not happen. If something does not happen. Unless they are stationed somewhere else. They won't be. They've been guarding the entrance for two weeks' Why should anything happen tomorrow? I don't know' It sure would he strange if soldiers would pick tangerines in wartime. You are strange. The major promised. Well, God help us. I hope, mo. Don't worry, Ivo. They will come. War news from the radio. Easy. Easy. No hurry' Good boy. Sit down' How are you feeling? Head is slightly spinning. It's nothing. We found this in your head. And these in your pockets. - Some tea? - Yes. Ahmed, drink up your tea. It will cool down. Ok then, enemies. He's Ahmed, he's Nika. Pleased to meet you. You know, Georgian, you may know already, don't be afraid. I have promised to our saviour not to kill you in his house. So if you want to live, don't go out. Don't even extend your head out, as I will chop it uff at once. But can he pee out the window? Enough! Enough. I'm sorry, Ivo. So they didn't come? Some tea? Well, don't worry about the tangerines. It's idiotic anyway to start a tangerine business in wartime. He doesn't happen to be your relative? Margus! Come in, why are you standing there? I don't know, I thought you got mad at me. Forget it. Come in. Let's sit outside. The weather is fair. I don't want to leave them alone for too long. You are not afraid they will kill each other? The Chechen gave his word. - And you believe him? - I do' - But the Georgian? - He, too. Well, since you have (heir word... Don't he surprised, there are people worth their word. And both of them in your house? Leave it alone. Maybe you want to send one over to my place? No, the skirmish took place at your gate. They broke your fence. You can see the van from your house, and so on. No, it's safer at my place. Yes, quite. Come to my place this evening' The boys will retire early, let's get a drink. Agreed. So, this evening? Don't get mad at me, but maybe you'll come to Estonia with me? Ivo, maybe we could find another melody? It drives me crazy. But I like it' I'm listening. But what sort of music do you like, Georgian? I don't like this one. Georgian music? I like Georgian music. And Georgian land, tau? Where's the Georgian land? Here. The one you are sitting on, is Georgian land. You're sitting on Georgian land. No' I'm sitting on an Estonian chair. Vary funny. Yes, on an Estonian chair standing in an Estonian house that's standing on an Abkhazian land. Listen, did you go to school at all? Do you have schools? What? I'm asking if you have schools. What are you smirking at, alien. What have you lost here in Georgia? I'm here to protect a tiny nation from evil aliens like you! It seems that you really don't have schools there. You don't understand a thing. Don't know a thing' Didn't study any history? Haven't read any books? I'm not going to be offended by you, I don't care what you're blabbering. You are safe hare, blabber all you want. Ok, let's go outside right now! You can't even walk! I could kill you with a rag. Wouldn't be too manly. Recover first, then we'll see what'll be left of you. You son of a bitch! Don't brag if you're not good for it! Fucking maggot! Get lost from my country, cunt! I'm telling You, idiot, it's not Georgian land! Go ahead, sleep. You don't have much time left. Enough, Ahmed! Sorry, Ivo, but will you tell him to shut up, too? You will shut up soon! Quiet... - Good morning, Ivo! - Hello. - How are you? - Recovering, That's good. And where's your enemy? Still sleeping? No, the enemy's not sleeping. Good morning. How's your head? Pain is almost gone. While standing. It's difficult to lie. But you can bake an example from a horse. Sleep on your feet. Am I talking to you? Do horses talk at all? Some humour. Suits your intelligence well. Ok, I'll behave. - Some tea? - Yes. Shall I pour you. Bro? On your head? You don't want to try. Again. Thank you. Ivo, is this your daughter? No, his granddaughter. What's her name? None of your business. There are cars approaching. Ahmed, they are Ahkhazians. If they enter, will you give him away? No, I have to kill him myself. Good. Then we tell them he's Ibrahim. And you killed all the Georgians. You're not asking ma? Ivo, give me my gun! Quit your foolish talk. You can't balk, because you caught it to your head. That's it. You know why you have to be silent? Because first, they will shoot me. Even if I curse Georgians, you will stay quiet. So, he can't talk after getting wounded. - Hello, Ivo. - Hello, Asian. Listen, we saw a Georgian van over there in a chasm near Margus' plantation. And there is a car here at your place. Oh, Margus. You're here' So what happened? Where are the Georgians? All killed. Chechens wasted them. But we saved two Chechens. They are here, wounded. In your house? Come in, I'll introduce you. Right, I'd like to shake hands. Come in. Here you are' Sit, don't get up, brother, you're wounded. I'll live. - Asian. - Ahmed. Asian. He's Ibrahim, but he can't talk, was wounded to his head. Well, I'll be... Fuck 'em. How is it? Got hurt and tongue isn't working? Stupid. A brick fell on my neighbour's head, and his legs stopped moving. There are spots in your head that move all parts of your body. Like here, maybe, is a leg spot, and here, one for hands. Get it? He didn't gel a damn thing! I have good vodka. Sit down. No, Ivo, we're off to the front. They say it': Total mayhem there. And what will happen? We'll flush the fuckers away. You doubt it? No, Asian, of course not. These guys are helping. Haw many Georgians were there? Three. They saw us on the mad and started to shoot. We turned around, they followed. Then Ibrahim caught a bullet to his head, we rammed a fence and drove into the plantation. I managed to hit the bull's-eye with a bazooka. Well done, Ahmed. The bodies are in the van? No. We buried them in the woods. Throwing them out on a road like dogs would have been right for them. Asian, they're humans as well, very young ones. Well, let it be. You get wall. Most important is that he could talk again. As soon as we feel strong enough, we'll join you. Thanks, Ahmed, we're brothers. Asian... Do something good. I know it's a bad time, but Margus is about to lose a huge crop of tangerines. A major here promised to send people, but couldn't. Maybe you can help. We'll share the money afterwards. How many people do you need? 30 maybe, 40 would be better. No problem. Day after tomorrow the people will be here. We'll stay by the river for three days. And money is riot needed, a few crates of tangerines will do. Thank you, Asian. We'll be waiting. Day after tomorrow. I give you my word. Look, Ahmed, the Georgian is outside. Want to kill? Won't bother to kill him today, somehow. Margus! Asian promised to send 40 men day after tomorrow! This is very good. Coals only, Margus. No flame. I know! Are you cold? Want a jacket? No, thanks, Ivo, I'm not. What are you planning to do when you recover? Back to war? - You don't know? - I do. So, everything's ready. Try it and tell me, have you had anything like this before? We'll try. You have never eaten it? Try first, than talk. Delicious. You, Georgians, can't make shashlik. You think you can, as well as everything else. Everything else? What is it then we can't do? Many things. Well, for example? For example, you can't fight. At all' Laugh atl you want. You can't, but are still fighting. And lose every time, Now this is really funny. That's a lot of crap! I'm telling you, you are uneducated. You know nothing about history. It doesn't change a thing. Can't make shashlik, can't fight. It's a fact. I'll show you what I can do. Ga ahead, kill me as you promised. We're not in the house. Go ahead, try. You'll see what a Georgian is capable of! Let's go! Alright. Let's see. Calm down! Sit down' Sit! Enough of that. Or I swear, I saved you both and will kill as well. What is it with you, guys? Kill you, kill you... who gave you that right? - Who? - The war. Moron! - Shall I pour you? - Go ahead. Not for you, yet. You're sick. Well, symbolically. I don't drink at all, don't pour me any. What shall we drink to? To death! Go ahead, Margus. I can't drink m death. Why? It's their very mother. They are the children of death' I'm sorry, Ivo. It will not happen again, by Allah's name. What does it matter where you will kill each other, here or there. You recover, go back to the front and kill there. It's silly to make you sit at the same table. I'll drink to life. No. To death. I proposed a toast to death! - Margus? - Yes' Did you solve your tangerine problem? Eh, I'm probably annoying you all with my tangerines. Not at all. You see, it's not about money, although it's big money. It's just that a beautiful crop will perish. A pity. - Well, we can help you. - Yes' Come on, I have plenty of helpers anyway. Let's check on Ivo, he probably felt offended. Ivo's not offended, Ivo': Pissing. They probably bombed Asian by the river. Perhaps you'd eat something' - Good morning! - Morning. - Hello, Ivo. - Hello. I'd like to give you some money, for going hack to Estonia. What are you balking about? I can't take that sort of money. - What sort? - That sort. But I'm a mercenary, it's my pay. We honour the Christian religion. We honour other religions, too. But why are you suddenly talking about religion anyway? No reason. Who were the other Georgians for you? Why are you asking? I'm curious. Not very close friends. We met here. But they were good guys. Ibrahim was like a brother to me. We grew up together. I'm sorry. We need some firewood. I'll bring. Sit, let me. No, I'll go and take a little walk, too. I'm sorry, too, that your copatriots were killed. Good guys. Could have taken it, he meant it from his heart. I'll go help him' Let me help. No, I need exercise. You're looking at the picture of my granddaughter awfully often. - Why? - I'm not, You're wrong. No, you are looking. Frankly, she's vary pretty. I don't seem to he able to keep my eyes off her. Sorry, Ivo. She's even prettier in person. Her name is Mari' She means everything to me. Mari lives in Estonia? She used to live in this house. She left with the others, when war broke out here. Why didn't you leave? Hard to fare this place well? You lave it here? I love it. And hate. Do you have a family? Just my mother. My father died ten years ago. Brothers, sisters? No, I'm alone. And what were you doing in peacetime? I'm an actor. I play in a theatre. Seriously? - In cinema, too? - Rarely. They almost don't make films over here anymore, no money. And then decided to go to war. Yes. Felt obliged to and went. Didn't even tell my mother. When the war is over, I'll come back to Tbilisi to see you acting. And than we'll sit down and remember these days. And remember Ahmed. No, Ahmed will be there with me. And will clap for you. Come here! You! Don't show yourself! Sit quietly! Where are the guns? There, under the bed. But don't touch them. What are you fucking smirking at? Georgian? I'm not Georgian. - Sure? - He's yours, guys. Shay there, old man! I'm a Chechen. Then say something in Chechen! I'm a Chechen. Came to fight on your side, was wounded and he cured me. Comrade officer, I know your major. Quiet! Are you an idiot or what? Say something in Chechen! Say something, motherfucker! And what does that mean? No, he's Georgian alright' You're deaf or what? It's 'motherfucker' in Chechen. Fucking shoot him! Don't, he is yours! I said, quiet! Execute my command! Captain, maybe he is ours? Don't! Nika, throw me a gun! Cover me! That's it, Nika, that's it! They're dead. Margus! Motherfucker... - Finished? - Yes. There's only this cross of yours. - Like this? - Yeah. And Nika? We'll bury him elsewhere. - Where? - Beside my son. What did he die of? Was killed when the war broke. - By whom? - God knows. He went to the war at once. To protect our land, he said. I tried to talk him out of it, explained that it's nobody's war, but he wouldn't listen. So the Georgians killed him. Yes' But what difference does it make? How's that? You buried a Georgian next to your son. Ahmed, does it make any difference? - Answer me! - It doesn't. So, going straight home? I miss my family. Ivo, tell me... If it would have been me killed, not Nika, would you have buried me beside your son, too? Yes. A bit farther away though. I really don't know how to thank you. Go! I don't like farewells.
