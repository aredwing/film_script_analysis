[TAPE PLAYER FAST-FORWARDED] Interviewer: DID YOUR BROTHER MIND YOU BEING IN THE MAGAZINE? I THINK, UH, MY BROTHER WAS A LITTLE SHY BECAUSE HE HAS FRIENDS WHO ARE 18 YEARS OLD, 17 YEARS OLD, WHO SAID, YOU KNOW,"HEY, YOUR SISTER'S IN PLAYBOY." BUT HIS FRIENDS... WELL, I REMEMBER WHEN I CAME HOME TO VISIT THE FAMILY AND THEY CAME OVER AND THEY SAID, "I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. WE SAW YOU IN PLAYBOY," AND THEY SAID, "HOW'D YOU GET IN?" AND, "IT'S SO WONDERFUL." AND THEN HE STARTED THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT... THAT IS PRETTY NEAT. YOU KNOW, MY SISTER... [TAPE PLAYER FAST-FORWARDED] PLAYBOY'S MOTTO IS "THE GIRL NEXT DOOR." THEY LOOK FOR GIRLS THAT ARE WHOLESOME AND FRESH AND YOUNG AND NAIVE, THEY LOOK FOR ALL OF THAT. SO MOST OF THOSE GIRLS DO, UH, HAVE THA TYPE OF BACKGROUND. [TAPE PLAYER FAST-FORWARDED] IT TOOK ME 5 MONTHS TO SHOO MY PLAYMATE-OF-THE-YEAR LAYOUT. I SHOT OVER 20,000 PICTURES. IT'S PERFECTION. THEY DON'T GO FOR JUST, UH, GREAT NUDE SHOTS. THEY GO FOR ART.

OK, DOROTHY, WHEN YOU MEET PEOPLE, YOU SHOULD REALLY MAKE AN EFFOR TO TRY TO REMEMBER THEIR NAMES. IT MAKES A GOOD IMPRESSION. I'LL TRY FROM NOW ON. PAUL, EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING SO FAST. IT'S A LITTLE BANANAS. LET'S SEE, THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT SOME MORE SHOTS OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THEM, AND THEY SAY I'M NOT GOING TO BE ANNIVERSARY PLAYMATE, BUT THEY DID SAY I'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE, A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF BEING CENTERFOLD FOR AUGUST. MR. HEFNER WILL MAKE THE DECISION NEXT WEEK. ISN'T IT TERRIFIC? I AM SO EXCITED. WHAT'S HE LIKE? MR. HEFNER? OH, NICE, LIKE I SAID. BUT I GET THE FEELING THAT EVERYBODY TREMBLES A LITTLE WHEN THEY MENTION HIS NAME. YOU KNOW, "MR. HEFNER WANTS TO SEE YOU." WAS HE WEARING PAJAMAS? HOW'D YOU KNOW? I'VE BEEN WANTING TO HAVE THIS TALK WITH YOU FOR A WHILE, BUT I GUESS WE'VE BEEN KEEPING YOU PRETTY BUSY. I'LL SAY. COFFEE FOR MISS STRATTEN. YES, SIR.

AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN' GET THEM TO FIND YOU A LITTLE APARTMEN WHILE YOU'RE WAITING. NOT TOO EXPENSIVE. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU CAN STAY HERE, IF YOU'D LIKE, IN ONE OF THE GUEST ROOMS. WELL, I CAN LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT MYSELF. NO. WE'LL DO ALL THAT FOR YOU. ANYWAY, I HAVE A FEELING IT'S ALL VERY TEMPORARY, DOROTHY. I THINK THERE ARE VERY BIG THINGS AHEAD FOR YOU. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT I'LL CERTAINLY TRY FOR YOU. I KNOW YOU WILL. WELL, THAT JUS LEAVES MY, UH, MY SPEECH. READY? YES, SIR. PLAYBOY IS A VERY SPECIAL MAGAZINE, DOROTHY. THERE'S NO OTHER MAGAZINE LIKE IT. ALL THE WRITERS, EDITORS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, ALL THE GIRLS, ET CETERA, WE ALL HAVE A VERY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP. IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OTHER MAGAZINE. WE'RE ALL LIKE A... WELL, WE'RE JUST LIKE A FAMILY. A FAMILY. IT'S LIKE HAVING A FAMILY. [WHISPERING] The whole magazine is like having a family. THE WHOLE MAGAZINE IS LIKE HAVING A FAMILY. SEE? I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT'S A LOT OF BULL, BUT THAT'S HOW I THINK OF IT. THAT'S HOW WE ALL THINK OF IT. IT'S KIND OF A WORLD WITHIN A WORLD. IT'S A... WELL, IT'S A FAMILY. Dorothy: WASN'T THA NEAT ABOUT THE JOB AND THE APARTMEN AND EVERYTHING? HEY, LISTEN, IT ALL SOUNDS TERRIFIC. AND, GOD, MEETING ALL THOSE PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOOD CONTACTS. IT CAN ONLY HELP. KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I THINK SO. I'LL CALL TOMORROW. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. BYE. THANKS, JOHNNY. THAT WAS SOME PHONE CALL. HOW'S THE KID DOING? SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOING REALLY RIGHT.

I DON'T LIKE TO DO, LIKE, BLACK DUDES AND WHITE DUDES KIND OF STUFF, BUT THE THING I'VE NOTICED ABOUT BLACK DUDES AND WHITE DUDES IS THAT, LIKE, BLACK PEOPLE CHASTISE THEIR KIDS MORE. AND AS A RESULT, YOU DON'T SEE BLACK PEOPLE DOING CRAZY THINGS, LIKE SHOOTING THE PRESIDENT. THAT'S TRUE, 'CAUSE IF A BROTHER WOULD HAVE SHOT THE PRESIDENT, AS THEY WERE LEADING HIM AWAY, IT'D BE LIKE, "LOOK, MAN, JUST DON' TELL MY MAMA, MAN. MY MAMA GONNA KILL ME, MAN..." HERE SHE COMES. THAT'S ROOM 217 AND 218. AT THE BEVERLY HILTON. NO, I CAN'T, REALLY. OOPS. THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. THAT'S CALLED THE BUNNY DIP. Dorothy: PLAYBOY'S MOTTO IS "THE GIRL NEXT DOOR." THEY LOOK FOR GIRLS THAT ARE WHOLESOME AND FRESH AND YOUNG AND NAIVE. THEY LOOK FOR ALL OF THAT, SO MOST OF THOSE GIRLS DO, UH, HAVE THAT TYPE OF BACKGROUND. YOU KNOW, SNIDER, I HAVE THIS THEORY ABOUT YOU. OH, YOU DO, DO YOU? I THINK THE REASON WHY YOU'RE SO GOOD IN BED IS BECAUSE YOU JUST PLAIN TRY HARDER.

I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. OHH, MR. HEFNER, THAT'S JUST THE WAY HE USED TO DRESS. HE DOESN'T DRESS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. OH, GOD... I AM SO CONFUSED. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY UNDERSTANDS. I OWE IT TO HIM.

PAUL IS MARRIED TO DOROTHY STRATTEN. HE ALSO MANAGES HER. THE CHICKEN. HE TOLD ME HE AND DOROTHY WERE LOOKING FOR A NEW PLACE TO LIVE. AND MAYBE SINCE I WAS MOVING MY PRACTICE TO L.A., WE COULD FIND A PLACE TOGETHER, SHARE EXPENSES. WE MOVED IN IN OCTOBER, AND I TOOK THE TOP HALF, THEY LIVED ON THE FIRST FLOOR. IT WAS RIGHT NEAR THE FREEWAY, NOISY AS HELL. BUT IT SUITED ME FINE. IT HAD A YARD FOR KING, A GARAGE FOR MY ROLLS-ROYCE. THE ROLLS IS AN INVESTMENT FOR ME. IT'S AN INVESTMENT. I'M NOT INTO STATUS SYMBOLS LIKE MOST PEOPLE OUT HERE. IT'S AN INVESTMENT, OK? DOROTHY HAD ALREADY DONE THE CENTERFOLD, MISS AUGUST. SHE HAD ALREADY DONE PARTS IN FANTASY ISLAND AND BUCK ROGERS. THINGS WERE MOVING FAS FOR HER. I BECAME VERY FOND OF HER. SHE WAS HANDLING HER PUBLIC VISIBILITY VERY WELL. SHE WAS MATURING VERY FAST FOR 19, BUT TO ME, SHE WAS JUST A FRIEND. UNDERSTAND? A FRIEND. I HAD A GAL... ROBIN. I STAYED WITH HER MOST OF THE TIME, SO I DIDN'T SPEND MUCH TIME AT THE HOUSE. BUT WE'D GET TOGETHER ONCE IN A WHILE... SUNDAY AFTERNOON BARBECUE WITH A FEW FRIENDS.

IT SHOULDN' TAKE LONG. OK. TIME STEP AND THE LAST CHASE, RIGHT? RIGHT. A GIRL CAN'T JUS SIT BACK AND SAY, WELL, NOW MY PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD IN PLAYBOY, AND I'M SURE MANY PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE SEEN MY PICTURES, AND IF THEY LIKE ME, THEY'LL CALL ME. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. SO YOU STILL HAVE TO GO OUT THERE AND SEEK OPPORTUNITY? ABSOLUTELY. DON'T BE NERVOUS. HE'S REALLY VERY NICE. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] HI. HI. I'M ARAM. I'M DOROTHY.

THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE, OUT HERE, ISN'T IT? [MUTTERING] THAT'S REALLY UNFAIR. Dorothy: IT MAY SOUND CORNY, BUT I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE MY LOVE ON JUST ONE MAN. [CAMERA CLICKS] I'M FAITHFUL. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] GOD, I'M SUCH A JERK SOMETIMES. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. I DO UNDERSTAND. IT'S... IT'S JUST THAT I LOVE YOU SO DAMN MUCH. PAUL, LET'S GO BACK TO VANCOUVER.

UH-UH. BUT, I HAVE THIS TERRIFIC IDEA. I'M YOUR MANAGER, RIGHT? WELL, AS YOUR MANAGER, I THINK YOU SHOULD GO TO NEW YORK AND BECOME A BIG MOVIE STAR. I'LL STAY HERE AND WORK ON THE DOROTHY STRATTEN POSTER. IT'S GONNA MAKE US A FORTUNE. GOOD IDEA? IT CAME TO ME JUST LIKE THAT. HEY. YOU'RE MY QUEEN. I DON'T KNOW. HE SEEMED IN EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD SPIRITS JUST BEFORE SHE LEFT, HELPING HER WITH THIS AND THAT, BEING REALLY ATTENTIVE. GAVE HER A GOING-AWAY PARTY. MUST HAVE COST A FORTUNE. BORROWED MY ROLLS TO DRIVE HER TO THE AIRPORT. SAID, "THE QUEEN HAS TO GO IN STYLE." AND AFTER SHE LEFT, HE CAME BACK HERE TO THE HOUSE. AND THEN... THEN HE DID THE DAMNEDEST THING. I'M STILL NOT SURE WHY HE DID IT, BUT HE BUIL A DOGHOUSE FOR KING. A BEAUTIFUL DOGHOUSE. CRAZIEST THING. I DIDN'T THINK HE EVEN KNEW I HAD A DOG. YEAH, MOVE, CAROLINE. OK. YEAH, COME. GIVE ME MORE. COME IN A LITTLE FURTHER. YEAH, HOLD THAT, HOLD THAT. YEAH, MARK IT. MARK IT. TAKE A LOOK, GARY. IS THAT OK? THAT'S NICE. YOU SHOULDN' CHEW GUM. IT'S GOT SUGAR IN IT. [GIGGLES] THANK YOU. IT'S HIM. I KNOW IT. I CAN TELL FROM THE WAY SHE SAYS HIS NAME ON THE PHONE. AND WHAT DOES SHE SAY? NOT TOO MUCH. SHE ALWAYS SAYS SHE'S BEEN WORKING ON ARAM'S FILM ALL DAY AND DOESN' FEEL LIKE TALKING. WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THAT? SHE CALLS IT FILM. CHRIST, SHE NEVER SAID "FILM" BEFORE. SHE ALWAYS SAID MOVIE OR PICTURE, BUT NEVER FILM. I BET HE CALLS IT FILM. THAT'S HARDLY SUFFICIENT CAUSE TO PUT YOURSELF THROUGH ALL THIS. HE'S FEEDING HER COKE. PAUL, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET, BUT YOU SHOULDN' EVEN SAY THAT. AND KNOWING DOROTHY, I DOUBT IT. YOU'RE WRONG. YEAH? SHE KEP SNIFFING LAST NIGHT... [SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF] THROUGH THE WHOLE CONVERSATION SHE KEPT SNIFFING. MAYBE SHE'S GOT A COLD. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. COLD, MY ASS! PAUL, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE YOURSELF LOONY IF YOU KEEP GOING LIKE THIS. YOU GOT TO REALIZE, DOROTHY IS EVERY MAN'S FANTASY. EVERYBODY WHO SEES HER, OR EVEN HER PICTURE IN A MAGAZINE, FOR THAT MATTER, IS GOING TO BE COMING AFTER HER. AND THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOMEONE WHO'S RICHER THAN YOU, MORE FAMOUS THAN YOU, HAS A LONGER PENIS THAN YOU, AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. SHE'S NOT HERSELF, MAN! LOOK, I KNOW THESE GUYS, GEB. THEY STICK A LITTLE COKE UP A GIRL'S NOSE, THEY FIGURE SHE'LL DO ANYTHING. JESUS, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ONE WORD I'VE SAID. LOOK, ALL YOU CAN DO IS LET HER KNOW YOU LOVE HER. GET YOUR OWN FEE ON THE GROUND. STOP COMPLAINING! GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF A JOB, GET SOMETHING GOING, AND TRY TO MAKE HER PROUD OF YOU! I KNOW IT. YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN HANDLE THIS. I CAN HANDLE IT. WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS ARE YOU IN? WELL, I WAS THINKING IN TERMS OF A HEALTH SPA. YOU KNOW WHO DOROTHY STRATTEN IS, DON'T YOU? I THINK SO. WELL, THAT'S MY WIFE, AND I'M HER PERSONAL MANAGER... Paul: I WAS THINKING OF CALLING I "DOROTHY STRATTEN'S HEALTH SPA." ALL MODERN EQUIPMENT... NAUTILUS, STEAM, SAUNA. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE INTO THAT SORT OF THING OUT HERE. YOU JUST GIVE THEM WHITE TEETH, A SUNTAN, AND SOME MUSCLES, AND BANG! YOU'RE A HIT. I SAW A HOT LOCATION ON SANTA MONICA. THE REAL ESTATE WOMAN SAID THE OWNER WANTS 2,500 A MONTH, BUT SHE'S PRETTY SURE IT'LL COME DOWN. WHAT DO YOU THINK? SOMETHING WRONG, DOROTHY? NO. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT SOUNDS OK. YOU DON'T LIKE IT. I CAN TELL BY THE TONE OF YOUR VOICE YOU DON'T LIKE IT. SHIT! PAUL, DO YOU THINK WE COULD TALK TOMORROW? I'M REALLY TIRED, I GUESS. YEAH, SURE. UH... LISTEN... I CALLED A COUPLE OF TIMES LAST NIGHT. DID, UH, YOU GE ANY OF MY MESSAGES? YES, I DID, BUT WE WORKED VERY LATE. HOW LATE? I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY. I WAS WITH PEGGY. PEGGY JOHNSON. WHO'S PEGGY JOHNSON? SHE'S AN ACTRESS. SHE'S IN THE FILM, TOO. YOU'D LIKE HER. SHE'S REALLY NICE. FILM. ANYWAY, WE'VE BECOME FRIENDS, AND IT GOT SO LATE THAT I SPENT THE NIGH AT HER APARTMENT. I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU. I THOUGH YOU'D BE SLEEPING. I'M STAYING AT NANCY'S HOUSE. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] I GUESS YOU DIDN' WANT TO WAKE ME. PAUL, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU. NOTHING. IT WAS NOTHING. SO, UH, HOW ARE THINGS GOING ON THE SET? ARE YOU, UH, GETTING ALONG ALL RIGH WITH THE DIRECTOR? BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTAN THAT AN ACTRESS AND HER DIRECTOR SHOULD HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. HE'S STEALING MY WIFE. CAN'T WE SUE HIM? CAN'T WE MAKE THE BASTARD PAY? PAY FOR SOMETHING. SUE? FOR WHAT? FOR WHAT? YOU'RE THE DETECTIVE. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME FOR WHAT. ARE YOU HER MANAGER? YES. GOT ANY CONTRACTS, ANY PAPERS? NO, BUT... BUT IT WAS SOMETHING YOU BOTH TALKED ABOUT, RIGHT? IT WAS UNDERSTOOD, RIGHT? YES. IT WAS UNDERSTOOD. YOU HAD A VERBAL CONTRACT, THEN, RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT, WE HAD A VERBAL CONTRACT. WE'RE A TEAM. I DISCOVERED HER. YEAH, I KNOW. YOU SAID THAT. WELL, MAYBE... MAYBE WE CAN TRY SUING HIM FOR ENTICEMEN TO BREACH HER MANAGEMEN CONTRACT WITH YOU. YEAH, THAT'S IT. NOT SO FAST. I'M NOT A LAWYER. I'D HAVE TO CHECK WITH ONE. I KNOW WE'D HAVE TO HAVE DOCUMENTATION. I'D LIKE TO KILL THE SON OF A BITCH. I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT. Dorothy: HE CALLED ME 5 TIMES LAST NIGHT. I DIDN'T GET ANY SLEEP. THAT'S WHY I KEP MISSING MY MARK. WE'LL GET I AFTER LUNCH. I DON'T KNOW WHY I FEEL THIS LOYALTY TO HIM. HE'S FOOLING AROUND. I KNOW IT. HE'S GOT OTHER WOMEN. HE ALWAYS HAS. AT ABOUT 3:00 IN THE MORNING, EVERY FUCKING CREEP ON THE STRIP SEEMS TO WIND UP AT OUR JOINT. HE DIDN'T LOOK ANY DIFFEREN FROM ANY OTHER SCHMUCK IN THIS TOWN, BUT HE TALKED NICER. HE SAID HE COULD GET ME IN PLAYBOY, THAT HE KNEW HEF. SAID HE COULD GET ME IN THE MOVIES. HE HAD A BUSINESS CARD AND A MERCEDES 450 SL, SO WHAT THE FUCK? Aram: WHAT ABOU THE HEALTH CLUB IDEA? HE COULDN'T GE ANY BACKING FOR IT. NO ONE WOULD GIVE HIM ANY MONEY. WHAT? SAY IT. WELL, I JUST DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD LEND YOUR NAME TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT... A HEALTH CLUB... WITH HIM OR ANYONE ELSE. THE MORE HE FAILS, THE MORE HE SEEMS TO HANG ON TO ME. YEAH, THIS IS PAUL SNIDER. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO HEF... [WHISPERING] Snider. MR. HEFNER IS OUT OF TOWN. CAN I HELP YOU? WHO IS THIS? WHO AM I TALKING TO? I'M ROY, MR. HEFNER'S ASSISTANT. OH. WELL, LISTEN, ROY, HERE'S WHAT IT IS. I'D LIKE TO DROP BY THE MANSION TONIGH AND TALK TO HEF. I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU... YEAH, RIGHT. HE'S OUT OF TOWN. OH, SHIT. I SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU WERE BULLSHITTING ME. THERE IS SOMEONE I'D LIKE HIM TO SEE. WOULD YOU MAYBE LEAVE MY NAME AT THE GATE, ROY? I'M VERY SORRY, I CAN'T DO THAT. ONLY MR. HEFNER HIMSELF CAN DO THAT. AW, SURE YOU CAN, ROY. I KNOW IT'S DONE. IT'S DONE ALL THE TIME. COME ON, GIVE IT A TRY. HEY, WE'VE MET, HAVEN'T WE, ROY? I WAS PROBABLY WITH DOROTHY... DOROTHY STRATTEN? I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU. I WILL LEAVE YOUR MESSAGE, THOUGH. OK, SPORT, LEAVE THE MESSAGE. I'LL CALL BACK LATER. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? I BET YOU DON' EVEN KNOW HEFNER. WHAT TIME WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO CALL BACK? I REALLY COULDN'T TELL YOU. NO. WELL, I DIDN' THINK YOU COULD. THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP, ROY. YOU'RE WELCOME. ARE WE OR AREN'T WE GOING? THAT SON OF A BITCH WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME. DO YOU WANT TO STAY WITH HIM? DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE HIM? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME LEGAL HELP. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO A LAWYER. DOROTHY, YOU JUST CAN' LET HIM DO THIS TO YOU. HE'S GOT TO GIVE YOU MORE FREEDOM. YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND, YOU'RE JUS NOT THE SAME GIRL YOU WERE IN VANCOUVER. YOU'VE GROWN. YOU'VE MATURED. I SEE IT HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES, EVERY DAY. YOU'RE UNIQUE, DOROTHY. AND YOU HAVE A UNIQUE GIFT. YOU'VE GROWN, AND HE STAYED THE SAME. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Dorothy: HOLLYWOOD HASN'T CHANGED MY VALUES OR MY PERSONALITY, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY MADE ME WISER. I THINK I'VE GAINED 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN 18 MONTHS. YOU'VE OUTGROWN HIM. THIS IS A LITTLE ROUGH. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO HEAR IT? OK. "SHE'S PRACTICALLY MOVED OUT OF THE WYNDHAM. "SHE USUALLY GOES THERE AFTER SHOOTING, "PICKS UP MESSAGES, "AND WALKS OVER TO THE PLAZA. "HE'S IN SUITE 1210. "THEY USUALLY EA IN THE HOTEL. "AND IN THE MORNING, SHE GOES BACK TO THE WYNDHAM "WHERE SHE WAITS FOR THE STUDIO CAR TO COME PICK HER UP." SO YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG. IT IS HIM. THEY'RE HIDING I PRETTY GOOD. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, SURE. I JUST GOT TO TAKE A PISS. IF WE JUST HAD SOMETHING... A LETTER, A TAPE, ANYTHING WHERE SHE TALKS ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT THING, I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING. ON ENTICEMENT, I MEAN. AH, FUCK BOTH OF THEM. WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY, "LOOK, YOU WANT HER, PAL? YOU CAN HAVE HER. BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY." I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, BUT I DON'T THINK SO. HEY, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING IN ALIENATION OF AFFECTIONS. I DON'T THINK SO. [WEAPON COCKS] YEAH, IT WAS 379.95 NEW. AND YOU CAN HAVE I FOR 250...EVEN. IT'S ONLY A YEAR OLD. HA HA HA HA! IT WAS ONLY FIRED ON SUNDAYS BY A LITTLE OLD PSYCHOTIC SCHOOLTEACHER. HOW DO YOU LOAD IT? OH, EASY. IT TAKES ONE TO 5. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE. YOU PUT I IN THE CHAMBER, YOU PRESS THE BUTTON, AND YOU COCK IT... AND SHE'S READY TO GO. LEFTY, HUH? FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? WELL, WE GOT A SALE? WE WAS ACTING REALLY WEIRD. HE PASTED, PINNED, SCOTCH-TAPED, GLUED PHOTOS OF HER, OF HIM, OF HIM AND HER, OF HER AND HIM, ALL OVER THE DOWNSTAIRS LIKE SOME SORT OF BIZARRE SHRINE. WEIRD. FRANKLY... I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE LIKE A SOAP OPERA. AND I OBVIOUSLY MISREAD HIM. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME PICTURE. AW, LOOK. THAT'S EILEEN. WHAT A KID. I WAS THINKING OF BRINGING HER DOWN HERE FOR A VISI WHEN DOROTHY COMES BACK. THAT'D BE FUN. IT'S ROUGH. IT'S REALLY ROUGH. I'M NOT SURE I CAN TAKE IT. LISTEN, ROBIN, I WAN TO GET THESE TO KING. DID YOU SEE THE PROM PICTURE? DID I SHOW THAT TO YOU? I BOUGHT HER THIS WHITE DRESS. HERE IT IS. I'VE NEVER FEL THIS WAY BEFORE. SHE BROKE MY HEART. NICE, HUH? I'VE GO A BETTER ONE.
